(Woori the Virgin)

9
00:01:00,414 --> 00:01:01,585
What?

10
00:01:04,225 --> 00:01:05,524
Gosh. What did I just dream?

11
00:01:17,674 --> 00:01:20,375
(Episode 8)

12
00:01:48,965 --> 00:01:51,034
Sir, are you all right?

13
00:01:54,504 --> 00:01:55,704
Yes.

14
00:02:01,885 --> 00:02:06,113
Our lifting patches are on the front line of our products.

15
00:02:06,114 --> 00:02:07,885
Is this the best you can do?

16
00:02:08,355 --> 00:02:09,783
As for this scene,

17
00:02:09,784 --> 00:02:12,424
this is exactly what your marketing team sent me.

18
00:02:12,425 --> 00:02:14,054
They gave that to you as a reference.

19
00:02:14,055 --> 00:02:15,965
You should develop the idea.

20
00:02:17,264 --> 00:02:19,164
You told us to use exactly what you gave us.

21
00:02:19,794 --> 00:02:23,064
How could you call yourself a writer when you have no imagination?

22
00:02:24,034 --> 00:02:25,534
I see. Is this your limit?

23
00:02:28,844 --> 00:02:29,973
All right.

24
00:02:29,974 --> 00:02:31,313
Why don't we wrap it up here?

25
00:02:31,314 --> 00:02:32,974
That's it for today's meeting.

26
00:02:36,215 --> 00:02:38,115
We'll give you an update after we settle it internally.

27
00:02:39,485 --> 00:02:40,655
And Team Leader Lee.

28
00:02:40,754 --> 00:02:42,185
We need to have a talk.

29
00:02:42,284 --> 00:02:43,853
I'm a director now.

30
00:02:43,854 --> 00:02:45,294
I'm not a team leader anymore!

31
00:02:47,824 --> 00:02:49,965
Seriously. She's so annoying.

32
00:03:07,544 --> 00:03:09,245
(Woo Ri)

33
00:03:50,724 --> 00:03:51,895
That jerk.

34
00:03:52,025 --> 00:03:53,294
Are you all right?

35
00:03:54,194 --> 00:03:55,494
Yes.

36
00:03:55,495 --> 00:03:58,465
Thank you.

37
00:03:59,634 --> 00:04:02,603
Sir, where are you coming from? Are you going somewhere?

38
00:04:02,604 --> 00:04:05,503
Me? Oh, no. Well,

39
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,603
I...

40
00:04:06,604 --> 00:04:09,443
- I should go now. I'll get going. - Okay.

41
00:04:09,444 --> 00:04:11,043
- No. I should go that way. - Bye.

42
00:04:11,044 --> 00:04:12,775
Bye.

43
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,694
(Woo Ri)

44
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:39,475
You're her, right?

45
00:04:40,574 --> 00:04:42,203
- Ms. Oh Woo Ri Maria? - Yes?

46
00:04:42,204 --> 00:04:43,745
You're in the youth club at church, right?

47
00:04:44,274 --> 00:04:46,144
Yes. That's me. Why do you ask?

48
00:04:46,415 --> 00:04:47,914
We wanted to meet you.

49
00:04:47,915 --> 00:04:49,084
Pardon? Me?

50
00:04:50,084 --> 00:04:52,384
Could you give my wife a hug?

51
00:04:52,514 --> 00:04:54,554
Yes. Please give me a hug.

52
00:04:54,555 --> 00:04:56,083
Me? Why?

53
00:04:56,084 --> 00:04:58,254
Thank you!

54
00:04:58,524 --> 00:04:59,754
I did it!

55
00:04:59,894 --> 00:05:01,024
- Thank you. - Thank you.

56
00:05:05,095 --> 00:05:06,235
What was that?

57
00:05:07,295 --> 00:05:09,804
- I got it. - Goodness. I'm on a roll!

58
00:05:09,805 --> 00:05:12,474
All right. You don't have enough junk cards and bright cards.

59
00:05:12,475 --> 00:05:13,935
And I doubled my bet earlier.

60
00:05:14,404 --> 00:05:16,073
Look at my points.

61
00:05:16,074 --> 00:05:17,174
Hey. You brought cash, right?

62
00:05:17,175 --> 00:05:19,915
If I don't have cash, I'll wire it to you.

63
00:05:25,285 --> 00:05:26,615
Hey, Hyung Sik.

64
00:05:27,214 --> 00:05:29,254
Of course. I'm available.

65
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:30,724
Where in Gyeonggi Province?

66
00:05:30,725 --> 00:05:32,095
Is there a good restaurant in Gyeonggi Province?

67
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:34,154
There are a lot of good restaurants in Seoul too.

68
00:05:34,725 --> 00:05:36,365
I hope you don't have an ulterior motive.

69
00:05:38,894 --> 00:05:40,095
- Goodness. I'm cold. - Hey!

70
00:05:41,305 --> 00:05:43,365
Hyung Sik. Sorry. I'll call you back.

71
00:05:43,865 --> 00:05:45,273
Hey, have you gone mad?

72
00:05:45,274 --> 00:05:47,035
Do you know how much I won?

73
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:48,844
I'm home.

74
00:05:48,845 --> 00:05:50,105
Woo Ri, you're home.

75
00:05:51,615 --> 00:05:53,573
What is it? Is something wrong?

76
00:05:53,574 --> 00:05:56,213
Nothing is wrong. Did you have dinner?

77
00:05:56,214 --> 00:05:57,785
Let's play fair and square.

78
00:05:58,055 --> 00:06:00,814
Do your one million followers know how petty you are?

79
00:06:05,194 --> 00:06:07,055
Gosh. It's nothing.

80
00:06:07,154 --> 00:06:09,323
We were playing board games after dinner.

81
00:06:09,324 --> 00:06:11,125
And your mother seems sensitive today.

82
00:06:12,464 --> 00:06:14,094
You guys should try to get along.

83
00:06:14,095 --> 00:06:16,105
Your mother is the problem.

84
00:06:17,064 --> 00:06:18,974
Why is she so fussy all the time?

85
00:06:18,975 --> 00:06:20,735
- What about Mom? - It's nothing.

86
00:06:21,004 --> 00:06:23,774
It will be too complicated to understand her. All right.

87
00:06:24,774 --> 00:06:27,115
My daughter, tell me. Do you know how to play Go-Stop?

88
00:06:27,274 --> 00:06:28,584
How about a finger flick?

89
00:06:29,745 --> 00:06:31,485
I don't play unless there's money on the table.

90
00:06:35,084 --> 00:06:36,124
Get comfortable.

91
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:37,384
You are my daughter indeed.

92
00:06:39,555 --> 00:06:40,925
Gosh.

93
00:06:49,904 --> 00:06:51,503
(Woo Ri)

94
00:06:51,504 --> 00:06:53,035
Gosh. What's going on with me?

95
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:54,375
Is it because of the dream?

96
00:06:54,944 --> 00:06:57,375
I keep getting butterflies whenever I see your mom.

97
00:06:57,774 --> 00:06:59,374
I shouldn't like her, right?

98
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:00,875
Right. I shouldn't.

99
00:07:01,285 --> 00:07:03,384
I can't. Wait. Why can't I? Why not?

100
00:07:04,485 --> 00:07:05,654
Gummy Bear.

101
00:07:07,355 --> 00:07:08,485
You're not sure either?

102
00:07:09,185 --> 00:07:11,054
Right. Daddy isn't sure either.

103
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:12,795
What? What did you say? We should sleep? Yes, let's do that.

104
00:07:13,795 --> 00:07:15,064
We should just go to sleep.

105
00:07:16,524 --> 00:07:17,665
Gosh.

106
00:07:17,935 --> 00:07:19,694
Just go to sleep.

107
00:07:48,394 --> 00:07:49,495
What?

108
00:07:50,394 --> 00:07:51,764
What did I just dream?

109
00:07:55,935 --> 00:07:57,064
No.

110
00:07:57,535 --> 00:07:59,704
- What did you say? - What's gotten into you today?

111
00:07:59,834 --> 00:08:01,035
Are you not feeling well?

112
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:03,045
- No. I just... - What?

113
00:08:03,845 --> 00:08:05,814
I just had a weird dream. That's all.

114
00:08:06,115 --> 00:08:07,875
A weird dream? What was it about?

115
00:08:08,714 --> 00:08:09,915
Well...

116
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,185
It's nothing.

117
00:08:14,584 --> 00:08:16,725
You know, it was just a weird dream.

118
00:08:16,925 --> 00:08:18,725
A dream that had nothing to do with my real life.

119
00:08:19,295 --> 00:08:21,125
A weird dream. That's all it was.

120
00:08:21,194 --> 00:08:22,864
- A plain, weird dream is all. - That's her!

121
00:08:22,865 --> 00:08:23,995
You're right!

122
00:08:24,365 --> 00:08:26,894
Hey, I have an exam next week.

123
00:08:27,134 --> 00:08:28,334
Can you give me a hug?

124
00:08:28,764 --> 00:08:29,833
What?

125
00:08:29,834 --> 00:08:31,504
- Me too! - Me too!

126
00:08:31,605 --> 00:08:33,035
Goodness.

127
00:08:34,675 --> 00:08:36,245
Good luck with the exam.

128
00:08:37,644 --> 00:08:39,014
But why do you want to hug me?

129
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,715
This is you, right? Oh Woo Ri.

130
00:08:44,544 --> 00:08:45,615
Gosh.

131
00:08:46,054 --> 00:08:47,253
Woo Ri.

132
00:08:47,254 --> 00:08:48,654
- What? - That's Woo Ri.

133
00:08:48,725 --> 00:08:49,754
(We support Oh Woo Ri Maria!)

134
00:08:49,985 --> 00:08:51,754
You're behind this, aren't you?

135
00:08:52,054 --> 00:08:53,254
Sister Woo Ri.

136
00:08:54,455 --> 00:08:56,825
I was going to make it a surprise, but you found out.

137
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:58,894
You're getting an award today.

138
00:08:59,034 --> 00:09:01,663
As the president of the youth club, I must show my support.

139
00:09:01,664 --> 00:09:03,434
(We support Oh Woo Ri Maria!)

140
00:09:03,764 --> 00:09:05,034
- An award? - Yes.

141
00:09:08,605 --> 00:09:10,444
Why would get an award?

142
00:09:10,445 --> 00:09:11,615
Woo Ri.

143
00:09:12,715 --> 00:09:14,445
You made such a sacred decision.

144
00:09:14,815 --> 00:09:16,615
We are so proud of you...

145
00:09:16,715 --> 00:09:18,855
for protecting the baby.

146
00:09:19,254 --> 00:09:21,085
The Lord gave you a life.

147
00:09:22,325 --> 00:09:23,783
After hearing your story,

148
00:09:23,784 --> 00:09:26,825
the Guardian of Life Headquarters wants to give you an award.

149
00:09:27,725 --> 00:09:29,893
The members of our church put together an event to celebrate it.

150
00:09:29,894 --> 00:09:31,995
But still. This is...

151
00:09:32,235 --> 00:09:35,105
We shouldn't make a big deal out of this.

152
00:09:36,504 --> 00:09:38,375
And this is weird.

153
00:09:38,904 --> 00:09:40,375
What is this?

154
00:09:41,105 --> 00:09:43,344
I made them to celebrate the award.

155
00:09:43,345 --> 00:09:44,605
You punk.

156
00:09:44,715 --> 00:09:46,445
Woo Ri isn't some saintess from the Bible.

157
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,044
There's a limit to your jokes!

158
00:09:48,184 --> 00:09:50,984
Because of these weird badges you made,

159
00:09:50,985 --> 00:09:53,784
people kept asking me to hug them.

160
00:09:55,825 --> 00:09:56,923
- Woo Ri! - Woo Ri!

161
00:09:56,924 --> 00:09:58,054
- What? - Woo Ri!

162
00:09:58,154 --> 00:09:59,254
- Sister! - Gosh!

163
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,225
- Please go away! - Sister Woo Ri!

164
00:10:02,695 --> 00:10:04,094
- Hey! - Woo Ri!

165
00:10:04,095 --> 00:10:05,835
- Please calm down! - Woo Ri!

166
00:10:05,934 --> 00:10:08,235
- Goodness. Please calm down. - Oh, no.

167
00:10:09,034 --> 00:10:10,235
No!

168
00:10:37,725 --> 00:10:40,633
- Sister Woo Ri! - Stop it!

169
00:10:40,634 --> 00:10:42,004
Go away!

170
00:10:51,544 --> 00:10:53,115
Are you hurt?

171
00:10:53,715 --> 00:10:54,745
I'm fine.

172
00:11:00,985 --> 00:11:03,225
They look good together.

173
00:11:03,355 --> 00:11:04,923
Mom, the treatment must be done.

174
00:11:04,924 --> 00:11:07,694
Right. You and I should go over there.

175
00:11:07,695 --> 00:11:09,595
- Why? - Come here.

176
00:11:10,695 --> 00:11:11,934
Are you all right?

177
00:11:12,164 --> 00:11:14,365
I'm sorry. This is all my fault.

178
00:11:14,394 --> 00:11:16,433
No. Why are you sorry?

179
00:11:16,434 --> 00:11:18,434
It's my fault. I injured myself.

180
00:11:19,835 --> 00:11:22,944
By the way, what was going on? Are you getting an award?

181
00:11:22,945 --> 00:11:25,574
No. It's nothing.

182
00:11:25,575 --> 00:11:26,575
I see.

183
00:11:27,245 --> 00:11:28,945
But what were you doing at the church?

184
00:11:29,784 --> 00:11:33,783
Oh, you left something in the conference room.

185
00:11:33,784 --> 00:11:34,884
Here.

186
00:11:35,254 --> 00:11:36,325
I see.

187
00:11:37,284 --> 00:11:38,923
You could have given it to me later.

188
00:11:38,924 --> 00:11:40,924
Well, I just thought I could swing by.

189
00:11:42,664 --> 00:11:46,133
You're always there to help me. You already helped me twice.

190
00:11:46,134 --> 00:11:47,995
Twice isn't a lot.

191
00:11:48,404 --> 00:11:50,335
I wish I could always be with you.

192
00:11:50,934 --> 00:11:51,934
Pardon?

193
00:11:53,975 --> 00:11:57,504
No. I mean, you must be careful for the baby.

194
00:11:58,375 --> 00:11:59,414
Right.

195
00:12:13,894 --> 00:12:15,995
- Ms. Oh. - Yes?

196
00:12:17,595 --> 00:12:20,634
Actually, I...

197
00:12:21,934 --> 00:12:23,004
Excuse me.

198
00:12:25,504 --> 00:12:26,774
Yes. Hello?

199
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,875
What? The police station?

200
00:12:30,745 --> 00:12:32,615
What? Why? My father?

201
00:12:32,745 --> 00:12:35,445
I even had a meal...

202
00:12:36,115 --> 00:12:38,215
and went to the sauna with your chief here.

203
00:12:38,514 --> 00:12:39,955
But I'm not going to tell you that.

204
00:12:39,985 --> 00:12:41,383
We've been keeping things on the down-low...

205
00:12:41,384 --> 00:12:42,753
because a man died in my hospital.

206
00:12:42,754 --> 00:12:44,753
But how do you expect me to run a hospital...

207
00:12:44,754 --> 00:12:46,293
when a cop keeps showing up there?

208
00:12:46,294 --> 00:12:49,324
I'm sorry. I'll talk to him.

209
00:12:49,325 --> 00:12:50,964
He's making a mess at my hospital...

210
00:12:50,965 --> 00:12:53,034
to catch a suspect that doesn't exist!

211
00:12:53,934 --> 00:12:56,004
And look at this. What will you do with this?

212
00:12:56,205 --> 00:12:59,403
This is called the full moon, the best yellow chrysanthemum.

213
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:03,173
I looked after this for ten years as if I were my own child!

214
00:13:03,174 --> 00:13:05,944
Seriously. You know what? I'm going to...

215
00:13:05,945 --> 00:13:08,684
Should I turn this place upside down today?

216
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:10,143
Call your chief.

217
00:13:10,144 --> 00:13:12,455
Dad. That's enough. Stop it.

218
00:13:13,914 --> 00:13:15,554
We don't want this to happen again.

219
00:13:16,085 --> 00:13:17,485
I'm so sorry.

220
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,264
You, Kang Jae!

221
00:13:31,904 --> 00:13:34,134
What on earth are you up to these days?

222
00:13:34,304 --> 00:13:37,904
What did you do at the hospital even without a warrant?

223
00:13:38,445 --> 00:13:40,274
Come on!

224
00:13:47,054 --> 00:13:48,955
Square your shoulders!

225
00:13:52,495 --> 00:13:54,024
Mother!

226
00:13:56,495 --> 00:13:58,664
You should have called first.

227
00:13:59,434 --> 00:14:01,195
I dropped by because I missed you.

228
00:14:02,164 --> 00:14:04,565
And I wanted to give you this too.

229
00:14:05,075 --> 00:14:07,933
My mom made jangjorim, and it made me think of you.

230
00:14:07,934 --> 00:14:09,705
You can finish two bowls of rice with this.

231
00:14:10,904 --> 00:14:11,975
Mother.

232
00:14:13,315 --> 00:14:15,314
Are you that touched by jangjorim?

233
00:14:15,315 --> 00:14:17,215
Thank you. I'll eat them.

234
00:14:19,684 --> 00:14:21,154
Why didn't you come to church?

235
00:14:22,085 --> 00:14:23,284
Because of Woo Ri?

236
00:14:25,254 --> 00:14:26,595
No.

237
00:14:27,695 --> 00:14:29,924
I'm investigating a case now.

238
00:14:31,565 --> 00:14:32,735
Kang Jae.

239
00:14:33,835 --> 00:14:35,464
Is it still hard?

240
00:14:35,465 --> 00:14:37,164
Gosh. No.

241
00:14:39,434 --> 00:14:43,274
I think Woo Ri is getting better little by little.

242
00:14:44,105 --> 00:14:47,345
So you need to get yourself together too.

243
00:14:48,014 --> 00:14:49,044
Okay?

244
00:14:50,284 --> 00:14:53,654
I'm all right too, Mother.

245
00:14:54,615 --> 00:14:55,725
Thank you.

246
00:14:58,054 --> 00:15:00,524
- All right. - You're leaving already?

247
00:15:01,325 --> 00:15:02,424
Kang Jae.

248
00:15:03,294 --> 00:15:04,924
Should I give you a hug?

249
00:15:05,235 --> 00:15:08,334
- No. It's all right. - No, you need one. Come here.

250
00:15:08,335 --> 00:15:10,433
- Gosh. - I'm like your mom. Come here.

251
00:15:10,434 --> 00:15:12,403
Gosh. You're way too young.

252
00:15:12,404 --> 00:15:14,933
- Gosh. Come here. - Hello.

253
00:15:14,934 --> 00:15:17,705
- I won't fall for that. - Mother.

254
00:15:18,414 --> 00:15:20,974
- Mother. - Stay strong. Okay.

255
00:15:20,975 --> 00:15:22,384
Okay.

256
00:15:24,615 --> 00:15:27,815
Gosh. The movie, "Oldboy", ruined it for everyone.

257
00:15:28,424 --> 00:15:30,584
Ma Ri, isn't that such a ridiculous stereotype...

258
00:15:30,585 --> 00:15:32,825
to give only dumplings to the person you're locking up?

259
00:15:33,394 --> 00:15:35,923
Be quiet and eat unless you want to starve to death!

260
00:15:35,924 --> 00:15:37,464
You get well-balanced meals,

261
00:15:37,465 --> 00:15:40,095
put together by nutritionists even in prison.

262
00:15:40,865 --> 00:15:43,364
Hey. Do you want to go back there for the well-balanced meals?

263
00:15:43,365 --> 00:15:45,274
Shut your mouth and watch the TV.

264
00:15:46,674 --> 00:15:49,004
Gosh. It's been so long since I touched a remote.

265
00:15:49,245 --> 00:15:50,375
Thank you.

266
00:15:57,414 --> 00:16:01,053
(Next episode)

267
00:16:01,054 --> 00:16:03,084
Chun Sa Da falls into Na Beom In's trap...

268
00:16:03,085 --> 00:16:04,085
and gets abducted.

269
00:16:06,294 --> 00:16:09,524
Chun Sa Da removes the steel handcuffs and escapes.

270
00:16:11,164 --> 00:16:13,095
Chun Sa Da will fight back soon.

271
00:16:14,195 --> 00:16:17,105
"Mask of Desire" will air at 9pm on Thursday.

272
00:16:17,634 --> 00:16:18,804
Look forward to the drama.

273
00:16:19,105 --> 00:16:21,945
It will air at 9pm on Thursday?

274
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:25,475
I'm going out.

275
00:16:26,575 --> 00:16:27,674
Woo Ri.

276
00:16:28,644 --> 00:16:30,345
Take this with you.

277
00:16:30,485 --> 00:16:32,153
What's this, Grandma?

278
00:16:32,154 --> 00:16:34,753
I made some ox bone soup. You should bring it to him.

279
00:16:34,754 --> 00:16:36,324
Raphael hurt his leg.

280
00:16:36,325 --> 00:16:38,085
Oh, for Raphael?

281
00:16:38,424 --> 00:16:39,994
You didn't have to do that.

282
00:16:39,995 --> 00:16:42,994
You should bring this to him. He got hurt, trying to help you.

283
00:16:42,995 --> 00:16:47,434
So bring this to him and tell him to recover with this soup. Okay?

284
00:16:47,664 --> 00:16:50,705
All those fancy meals can't be better than home-cooked meals.

285
00:16:50,804 --> 00:16:52,504
Those meals don't have love in them.

286
00:16:52,975 --> 00:16:54,874
Okay.

287
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:58,714
Go there after work and have a meal with him too. Okay?

288
00:16:58,715 --> 00:17:00,414
I won't put aside dinner for you.

289
00:17:01,245 --> 00:17:02,245
Wait.

290
00:17:06,414 --> 00:17:09,984
Please thank your grandmother for the food.

291
00:17:10,954 --> 00:17:12,125
It looks great.

292
00:17:13,454 --> 00:17:16,494
I'm sorry to make you go through this trouble because of me.

293
00:17:16,795 --> 00:17:19,335
You weren't able to go to work because of your leg today?

294
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:21,194
Oh, no.

295
00:17:21,295 --> 00:17:23,904
I had already taken a day off today. It wasn't because of the injury.

296
00:17:24,234 --> 00:17:26,535
I'm all right. It doesn't hurt at all.

297
00:17:27,634 --> 00:17:28,944
That's a relief.

301
00:17:43,484 --> 00:17:46,754
One of my favorite writers published a new book.

302
00:17:46,755 --> 00:17:48,095
I was just reading that.

303
00:17:48,765 --> 00:17:50,124
It's a collection of short stories.

304
00:17:50,125 --> 00:17:51,494
There's a story titled "The Heart of Summer".

305
00:17:51,825 --> 00:17:53,194
That one is my favorite.

00:18:26,194 --> 00:18:29,434
You should finish your tea before you go.

309
00:18:32,535 --> 00:18:34,105
Take your time with it.

310

And drink everything before you go.

I need an autograph from Hyung Sik too.

321

- Goodness. You're so handsome. - I'm a huge fan.

322
00:19:51,884 --> 00:19:55,315
All right. We bought some snacks today!

323
00:19:58,085 --> 00:19:59,953
- That looks tasty. - It's over. Aren't you leaving?

324
00:19:59,954 --> 00:20:01,993
You said you needed to be at the shoot. I'm leaving now.

Wait. Where are you going?

326
00:20:03,664 --> 00:20:06,193
To the hospital. Woo Ri's getting her sonogram today.

327
00:20:06,194 --> 00:20:07,464
Then, let's go together.

328
00:20:17,305 --> 00:20:18,674
The baby's doing great.

329
00:20:18,914 --> 00:20:20,015
Can you see this?

330
00:20:20,115 --> 00:20:23,383
These are the eyes, nose, and mouth.

331
00:20:23,384 --> 00:20:25,684
And can you see the arms and legs?

332
00:20:26,815 --> 00:20:29,384
You'll be able to hear the heartbeat since it's week eight.

333
00:21:09,095 --> 00:21:11,325
Raphael, are you crying?

334
00:21:11,525 --> 00:21:12,795
No, I'm not.

335
00:21:14,035 --> 00:21:16,834
I'm usually not that emotional.

336
00:21:16,835 --> 00:21:18,305
Gosh, why am I like this?

337
00:21:19,575 --> 00:21:21,704
It's okay. Many people cry.

338
00:21:22,404 --> 00:21:23,704
- Here you go. - Thank you.

339
00:21:24,444 --> 00:21:26,345
Gosh. I'm just...

340
00:21:26,845 --> 00:21:29,515
Are you okay?

341
00:21:29,585 --> 00:21:31,644
I'm okay...

342
00:21:33,855 --> 00:21:35,085
Oh gosh.

343
00:21:37,325 --> 00:21:38,894
Why is he crying like that?

344
00:21:39,154 --> 00:21:40,825
This isn't something to cry over like that.

345
00:21:41,224 --> 00:21:43,224
He's such a family man.

346
00:21:43,694 --> 00:21:46,365
He must be so fond of the baby to be that way.

347
00:21:46,795 --> 00:21:48,365
He's overreacting.

348
00:21:49,535 --> 00:21:51,765
They look good together.

349
00:21:52,835 --> 00:21:53,933
What do you mean?

350
00:21:53,934 --> 00:21:55,404
Woo Ri and the baby's father.

351
00:21:55,805 --> 00:21:57,174
They look good together.

352
00:21:57,375 --> 00:21:59,344
That's ridiculous.

353
00:21:59,345 --> 00:22:00,814
Why not?

354
00:22:00,815 --> 00:22:02,943
He's divorced and Woo Ri also...

355
00:22:02,944 --> 00:22:04,785
How will you ever see Kang Jae?

356
00:22:04,884 --> 00:22:06,614
Well, that is...

357
00:22:06,615 --> 00:22:07,784
If you haven't lost your mind,

358
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:09,224
don't ever say such a thing to Woo Ri.

359
00:22:15,494 --> 00:22:16,625
By the way,

360
00:22:17,295 --> 00:22:19,194
I usually don't cry.

361
00:22:20,164 --> 00:22:23,005
I don't even cry when I watch a sad movie.

362
00:22:23,664 --> 00:22:26,704
But whenever I think about the baby...

363
00:22:30,674 --> 00:22:31,845
I'm sorry.

364
00:22:32,474 --> 00:22:34,944
It's okay. You don't have to apologize.

365
00:22:35,115 --> 00:22:36,414
Gosh.

366
00:22:36,944 --> 00:22:38,285
I feel like crying again.

367
00:22:39,914 --> 00:22:43,354
They said you could see a 3D sonogram picture in week 20.

368
00:22:43,355 --> 00:22:46,095
We can see the baby's face...

369
00:22:47,125 --> 00:22:49,295
in 3D.

370
00:22:50,424 --> 00:22:53,164
You might faint from crying if you see it.

371
00:22:55,535 --> 00:22:56,734
Right.

372
00:22:56,934 --> 00:22:59,234
I should get fully prepared for it.

373
00:23:14,414 --> 00:23:16,154
I have a plan to catch this guy.

374
00:23:19,095 --> 00:23:20,595
This is the police. Put your hands up.

375
00:23:21,154 --> 00:23:22,963
I'll pretend that I'm a maintenance guy...

376
00:23:22,964 --> 00:23:23,964
and go in the ward.

377
00:23:24,095 --> 00:23:25,264
I'll tear down the wall if I have to...

378
00:23:25,265 --> 00:23:27,095
Kang Jae, you need to stop.

379
00:23:28,934 --> 00:23:31,004
I told you I'm not mistaken.

380
00:23:31,005 --> 00:23:33,404
I know why you're doing this. So stop.

381
00:23:35,234 --> 00:23:36,703
- What? - I know why you broke up...

382
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:37,904
with Woo Ri,

383
00:23:38,444 --> 00:23:41,045
and why you are so obsessed over that hospital.

384
00:23:41,815 --> 00:23:42,984
I hear that Woo Ri...

385
00:23:43,515 --> 00:23:45,214
got pregnant because of medical malpractice.

386
00:23:45,755 --> 00:23:47,815
And the sperm belongs to Raphael.

387
00:23:48,015 --> 00:23:49,285
Isn't that why you're doing this?

388
00:23:51,825 --> 00:23:53,694
I would've done the same thing.

389
00:23:54,924 --> 00:23:56,325
But let's stop.

390
00:24:02,934 --> 00:24:04,305
It's not that.

391
00:24:05,335 --> 00:24:07,105
Chairman Kim is in that hospital.

392
00:24:08,805 --> 00:24:10,575
I definitely heard it when Shin Mi Young died.

393
00:24:11,904 --> 00:24:13,545
I can no longer help you.

394
00:24:14,575 --> 00:24:16,144
I feel like I'm walking on eggshells.

395
00:24:37,134 --> 00:24:38,234
Seriously.

396
00:24:39,835 --> 00:24:41,974
Ms. Lee, I've made the changes in the draft.

397
00:24:44,845 --> 00:24:47,344
It turned dark outside while I waited for this.

398
00:24:47,345 --> 00:24:49,414
You get off work at 4pm in Sweden.

399
00:24:49,615 --> 00:24:51,214
Can't you work faster?

400
00:24:54,755 --> 00:24:55,924
What's that?

401
00:24:57,585 --> 00:24:59,325
I got it at church.

402
00:24:59,755 --> 00:25:01,923
There's this pregnant woman who decided...

403
00:25:01,924 --> 00:25:04,095
to have a child like the Virgin Mary.

404
00:25:05,095 --> 00:25:06,265
Is that Oh Woo Ri?

405
00:25:06,694 --> 00:25:08,565
How do you know her? Do you go to church as well?

406
00:25:09,265 --> 00:25:11,233
People came from all over...

407
00:25:11,234 --> 00:25:12,973
because they said it was good luck to touch her.

408
00:25:12,974 --> 00:25:14,335
But she didn't like it.

409
00:25:18,775 --> 00:25:20,545
Of course, she wouldn't like it.

410
00:25:22,275 --> 00:25:24,814
The more people know about this,

411
00:25:24,815 --> 00:25:26,315
the more she wouldn't like it.

412
00:25:28,984 --> 00:25:31,923
What was the name of the streamer...

413
00:25:31,924 --> 00:25:33,295
we contacted for viral marketing?

414
00:25:33,355 --> 00:25:34,555
BJ Bbikku?

415
00:25:35,125 --> 00:25:36,524
He has a lot of viewers,

416
00:25:36,525 --> 00:25:38,924
but his reputation isn't good. So, we cut him out.

417
00:25:38,994 --> 00:25:40,164
That sounds good.

418
00:25:40,394 --> 00:25:42,265
What was his contact information?

419
00:25:51,545 --> 00:25:53,075
Seeing our baby's picture...

420
00:25:53,644 --> 00:25:56,085
reminded me of you. So I'm sending you a picture.

421
00:26:14,295 --> 00:26:16,734
("The Heart of Summer")

422
00:26:33,585 --> 00:26:35,924
("The Heart of Summer")

423
00:26:51,505 --> 00:26:52,874
This is the place.

424
00:26:52,875 --> 00:26:55,274
I'm sure you're curious about where I am.

425
00:26:55,275 --> 00:26:56,604
This is...

426
00:26:56,605 --> 00:26:58,504
I am at...

427
00:26:58,505 --> 00:27:00,814
the site of a miracle.

428
00:27:00,815 --> 00:27:02,514
This is an amazing place.

429
00:27:02,515 --> 00:27:03,913
The modern version of Mary.

430
00:27:03,914 --> 00:27:05,545
What I mean by that is...

431
00:27:05,714 --> 00:27:09,014
that a virgin is pregnant. Isn't that unbelievable?

432
00:27:09,015 --> 00:27:13,054
I will satisfy your curiosity, so stay tuned.

433
00:27:13,055 --> 00:27:15,153
Mister. What are you doing?

434
00:27:15,154 --> 00:27:17,963
Hello, there. Nice to meet you.

435
00:27:17,964 --> 00:27:19,365
Is Ms. Oh Woo Ri here?

436
00:27:19,464 --> 00:27:22,133
I heard that a virgin got pregnant.

437
00:27:22,134 --> 00:27:24,104
Gosh. Turn that camera off and leave.

438
00:27:24,105 --> 00:27:25,163
- Go. - Leave.

439
00:27:25,164 --> 00:27:27,733
What do you mean leave? My viewers are watching.

440
00:27:27,734 --> 00:27:28,804
Yes.

441
00:27:28,805 --> 00:27:31,344
The person of interest has appeared.

442
00:27:31,345 --> 00:27:32,514
What is this?

443
00:27:32,515 --> 00:27:34,345
I'm BJ Bbikku.

444
00:27:34,375 --> 00:27:35,713
Can I have an interview?

445
00:27:35,714 --> 00:27:37,544
- No, I won't. Leave. - Leave.

446
00:27:37,545 --> 00:27:39,084
- Leave. - Go.

447
00:27:39,085 --> 00:27:40,483
- Go. - Come on.

448
00:27:40,484 --> 00:27:43,153
(BJ Bbikku)

449
00:27:43,154 --> 00:27:45,683
Why did such a man come to visit?

450
00:27:45,684 --> 00:27:47,325
What is it? Who came to visit?

451
00:27:48,325 --> 00:27:51,595
Some BJ came to visit.

452
00:27:52,164 --> 00:27:53,394
He said his name was Bbikku.

453
00:27:54,234 --> 00:27:55,565
You mean BJ Bbikku?

454
00:27:55,694 --> 00:27:58,704
He's infamous for troll-baiting to earn money.

455
00:27:59,005 --> 00:28:00,203
But wait.

456
00:28:00,204 --> 00:28:02,334
He came for you? Why?

457
00:28:02,335 --> 00:28:04,305
He wanted to interview me.

458
00:28:05,105 --> 00:28:06,414
What is this?

459
00:28:06,775 --> 00:28:08,714
There are so many victims.

460
00:28:09,214 --> 00:28:10,684
You don't avoid such a person because he's scary,

461
00:28:11,144 --> 00:28:14,085
you avoid him because it's good to avoid him.

462
00:28:14,255 --> 00:28:15,414
Maria.

463
00:28:16,184 --> 00:28:17,423
- Hello. - Thank you.

464
00:28:17,424 --> 00:28:18,483
Thank you so much.

465
00:28:18,484 --> 00:28:19,723
I'm pregnant.

466
00:28:19,724 --> 00:28:21,923
We had trouble getting pregnant for five years.

467
00:28:21,924 --> 00:28:24,194
But we got pregnant after we met you.

468
00:28:24,394 --> 00:28:25,494
Thank you so much.

469
00:28:26,194 --> 00:28:27,295
Congratulations.

470
00:28:27,795 --> 00:28:30,304
But you're not pregnant because of me.

471
00:28:30,305 --> 00:28:33,535
No. I got pregnant after you gave me a hug.

472
00:28:33,704 --> 00:28:35,433
A miracle happened.

473
00:28:35,434 --> 00:28:38,505
Yes. There isn't a greater miracle than this.

474
00:28:38,575 --> 00:28:41,574
Okay.

475
00:28:41,575 --> 00:28:43,314
I've seen everything.

476
00:28:43,315 --> 00:28:44,943
You saw this, didn't you?

477
00:28:44,944 --> 00:28:49,153
The modern version of Mary finally worked miracles.

478
00:28:49,154 --> 00:28:51,355
Give me an interview. It's such a good day.

479
00:28:51,454 --> 00:28:54,024
And congratulations on getting pregnant, you two.

480
00:28:54,025 --> 00:28:55,423
Let's do an interview together.

481
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:57,224
Excuse me. Leave.

482
00:28:57,394 --> 00:28:59,564
This is the last warning. I won't let this go.

483
00:28:59,565 --> 00:29:00,693
Hey, mister.

484
00:29:00,694 --> 00:29:03,233
The police will arrest you if you trespass like this.

485
00:29:03,234 --> 00:29:05,133
I will call the police if you walk through that door...

486
00:29:05,134 --> 00:29:06,334
one more time.

487
00:29:06,335 --> 00:29:07,604
You came back.

488
00:29:07,605 --> 00:29:09,703
Leave now, or I will call the police.

489
00:29:09,704 --> 00:29:11,403
I haven't committed any crimes.

490
00:29:11,404 --> 00:29:13,775
No police officer can stop this live broadcast.

491
00:29:14,015 --> 00:29:16,614
- Leave now. - Leave.

492
00:29:16,615 --> 00:29:18,443
- Help me. - Leave.

493
00:29:18,444 --> 00:29:21,784
I came out early this morning to satisfy your curiosity...

494
00:29:21,785 --> 00:29:24,054
and get enough sleep...

495
00:29:24,055 --> 00:29:25,883
You're doing such a good job.

496
00:29:25,884 --> 00:29:28,094
You went there in the morning.

497
00:29:28,095 --> 00:29:29,693
I should send him some tokens.

498
00:29:29,694 --> 00:29:30,994
What are you watching?

499
00:29:32,025 --> 00:29:33,194
Nothing.

500
00:29:33,765 --> 00:29:35,034
- What is it? - It's nothing.

501
00:29:35,035 --> 00:29:36,065
Gosh, give me that.

502
00:29:36,605 --> 00:29:37,633
I'm here.

503
00:29:37,634 --> 00:29:39,804
If she comes out, I'll get to the bottom of this.

504
00:29:39,805 --> 00:29:40,903
But I won't do this for free.

505
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:43,444
I will only do as much as the love you show me.

506
00:29:44,045 --> 00:29:45,604
She's out.

507
00:29:45,605 --> 00:29:48,844
Everyone, finally the miraculous virgin has appeared.

508
00:29:48,845 --> 00:29:50,143
Please give us a hug.

509
00:29:50,144 --> 00:29:51,243
Everyone.

510
00:29:51,244 --> 00:29:53,084
She's the miraculous virgin.

511
00:29:53,085 --> 00:29:55,785
Everyone, this is a miracle of the modern Mary.

512
00:29:55,884 --> 00:29:57,555
Experience the miracle.

513
00:29:57,654 --> 00:29:58,785
It's a miracle everyone.

514
00:30:04,265 --> 00:30:06,633
- What are you doing? - An interview.

515
00:30:06,634 --> 00:30:08,493
- Move. - What's going on?

516
00:30:08,494 --> 00:30:10,734
What's this? We're in the middle of an interview.

517
00:30:11,464 --> 00:30:12,733
Hey.

518
00:30:12,734 --> 00:30:15,474
- Maria, where are you going? - Don't leave.

519
00:30:19,005 --> 00:30:20,443
What are you doing?

520
00:30:20,444 --> 00:30:21,875
You think driving an expensive car fixes everything?

521
00:30:22,615 --> 00:30:24,243
I also have one at home.

522
00:30:24,244 --> 00:30:25,714
- Don't touch. - Where are you going, Maria?

523
00:30:33,025 --> 00:30:34,625
How did you know?

524
00:30:37,625 --> 00:30:41,234
Well, someone told me about it from watching the live stream.

525
00:30:41,295 --> 00:30:42,394
Are you okay?

526
00:30:42,464 --> 00:30:45,505
Yes... I'm okay.

527
00:30:45,664 --> 00:30:48,105
He kept distracting me from yesterday.

528
00:30:48,234 --> 00:30:50,105
What's this all about?

529
00:30:50,674 --> 00:30:53,315
I'll look into ways of getting rid of those people.

530
00:30:53,375 --> 00:30:56,743
No, it's okay. I'll take care of it since it's my problem.

531
00:30:56,744 --> 00:30:58,544
I'm the baby's father.

532
00:30:58,545 --> 00:31:00,984
I'll do anything if it concerns you.

533
00:31:02,414 --> 00:31:06,094
I'm grateful that you helped me many times these days...

534
00:31:06,095 --> 00:31:08,454
because of the baby.

535
00:31:09,255 --> 00:31:11,525
But I don't want to burden you.

536
00:31:11,625 --> 00:31:13,664
I'll take care of my own problems.

537
00:31:17,265 --> 00:31:18,335
Ms. Oh,

538
00:31:19,505 --> 00:31:21,805
can't I just help you?

539
00:31:22,204 --> 00:31:23,845
It's not just for the baby...

540
00:31:26,515 --> 00:31:31,044
I mean, I don't know how to put this...

541
00:31:31,045 --> 00:31:34,115
You'd think weird of me whichever way I put it.

542
00:31:35,755 --> 00:31:39,184
But I had a dream.

543
00:31:39,994 --> 00:31:41,825
Excuse me? A dream?

544
00:31:45,224 --> 00:31:47,095
Ms. Oh, I...

545
00:31:49,035 --> 00:31:50,934
Actually, I...

546
00:31:51,265 --> 00:31:52,565
Your phone is ringing.

547
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:57,504
No, it's nothing. Go ahead, answer your phone.

548
00:31:57,505 --> 00:31:58,575
Okay.

549
00:32:02,444 --> 00:32:03,684
Hello?

550
00:32:04,785 --> 00:32:05,785
Excuse me?

551
00:32:06,285 --> 00:32:08,854
Gosh, Mr. Kim.

552
00:32:08,855 --> 00:32:11,654
By the way, why did you say...

553
00:32:12,625 --> 00:32:14,824
that you won't give us the baby...

554
00:32:14,825 --> 00:32:17,625
if Ma Ri doesn't get a divorce? What did she do wrong?

555
00:32:18,994 --> 00:32:21,264
I don't want to judge...

556
00:32:21,265 --> 00:32:23,835
Ms. Lee's personal wrongdoings with my standards.

557
00:32:24,265 --> 00:32:28,034
I don't think she's fit to be the mother of the baby.

558
00:32:28,035 --> 00:32:29,744
That she was unfaithful in the marriage?

559
00:32:29,974 --> 00:32:31,874
No, that is a misunderstanding.

560
00:32:31,875 --> 00:32:33,775
I've made my decision very carefully.

561
00:32:34,115 --> 00:32:36,944
I think Mr. Raphael has the same opinion as me.

562
00:32:38,315 --> 00:32:41,884
You're more tenacious than I thought you were.

563
00:32:42,884 --> 00:32:46,084
Have you made a deal? I'll give you the baby, so get divorced.

564
00:32:46,085 --> 00:32:48,393
What do mean by a deal? That's not what it is...

565
00:32:48,394 --> 00:32:49,724
Okay. All right.

566
00:32:51,525 --> 00:32:53,795
What can I do if you're like this?

567
00:32:54,035 --> 00:32:58,365
I just didn't want my only son to raise a kid without a mother.

568
00:32:59,634 --> 00:33:01,535
The baby's inside of me.

569
00:33:01,904 --> 00:33:03,404
I'm the mother.

570
00:33:07,075 --> 00:33:09,243
Why did Ms. Oh Woo Ri come?

571
00:33:09,244 --> 00:33:10,345
Well...

572
00:33:11,815 --> 00:33:13,884
I called her to see if she was doing fine.

573
00:33:14,884 --> 00:33:17,085
Right. Is that so?

574
00:33:19,184 --> 00:33:22,194
She says she won't give us the baby if you don't divorce my son.

575
00:33:23,125 --> 00:33:25,393
Excuse me? What did you say?

576
00:33:25,394 --> 00:33:27,164
What can I do? That's the only grandchild I have.

577
00:33:28,394 --> 00:33:29,865
I think you need to get divorced.

578
00:33:31,734 --> 00:33:34,105
I think there is a misunderstanding.

579
00:33:34,734 --> 00:33:36,505
I'll look into it.

580
00:33:42,174 --> 00:33:43,814
They won't leave even when we asked them to.

581
00:33:43,815 --> 00:33:45,243
They're just sitting there.

582
00:33:45,244 --> 00:33:46,653
Did they order food?

583
00:33:46,654 --> 00:33:47,883
Of course, we did.

584
00:33:47,884 --> 00:33:51,254
Is it against the law to sit around after we finished our meal?

585
00:33:51,255 --> 00:33:55,194
How long are you going to sit there after ordering one dish?

586
00:33:55,394 --> 00:33:56,923
We can't do our business.

587
00:33:56,924 --> 00:33:59,535
Let the law decide.

588
00:34:02,365 --> 00:34:05,233
We wouldn't have sold the pork cutlet if it was him.

589
00:34:05,234 --> 00:34:06,335
Excuse me.

590
00:34:06,934 --> 00:34:09,305
You should leave if you're done with your meal.

591
00:34:09,474 --> 00:34:12,175
Why don't you all leave?

592
00:34:12,844 --> 00:34:14,643
Gosh, my legs.

593
00:34:14,644 --> 00:34:16,513
It hurt from before.

594
00:34:16,514 --> 00:34:18,413
I'm sitting here because my legs hurt.

595
00:34:18,414 --> 00:34:20,754
I'll leave when it gets better.

596
00:34:20,755 --> 00:34:23,683
I don't think we can force them out.

597
00:34:23,684 --> 00:34:26,694
When is Miracle Maria coming back?

598
00:34:26,695 --> 00:34:28,823
Shouldn't we wait for her until she comes?

599
00:34:28,824 --> 00:34:31,593
Yes, of course.

600
00:34:31,594 --> 00:34:33,664
Get out. Get out all of you.

601
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:36,405
Gosh.

602
00:34:38,135 --> 00:34:40,604
Gosh, lady.

603
00:34:40,605 --> 00:34:43,375
Let go of me.

604
00:34:43,405 --> 00:34:44,905
(Bbikku)

605
00:34:45,905 --> 00:34:46,973
(Bbikku TV Live)

606
00:34:46,974 --> 00:34:49,243
Everyone, did you see that? Did you see her splash water on me?

607
00:34:49,244 --> 00:34:51,613
She just splashed water on me.

608
00:34:51,614 --> 00:34:54,684
- Gosh. She's making me upset. - Ma'am. Why don't you relax?

609
00:34:55,085 --> 00:34:57,784
You could get sued for this.

610
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:02,824
I'm the stupid one selling pork cutlets to you.

611
00:35:03,025 --> 00:35:05,824
I'm closing the restaurant. We're closed.

612
00:35:06,164 --> 00:35:07,394
Everyone, out!

613
00:35:10,164 --> 00:35:12,834
Pork Cutlet, what are you doing here at this hour?

614
00:35:12,835 --> 00:35:14,974
I closed early today.

615
00:35:15,034 --> 00:35:16,643
Why? What's wrong?

616
00:35:16,644 --> 00:35:18,275
Gosh, this is so frustrating.

617
00:35:18,775 --> 00:35:20,574
Isn't there anything fun?

618
00:35:21,375 --> 00:35:22,613
Shall we play Go-stop?

619
00:35:22,614 --> 00:35:26,085
Gosh, my back hurts from playing it too much.

620
00:35:27,315 --> 00:35:28,315
Is that so?

621
00:35:28,985 --> 00:35:32,425
Gosh. Look at this.

622
00:35:35,724 --> 00:35:38,295
Mister, why don't you wear this?

623
00:35:38,465 --> 00:35:39,664
I'm okay...

624
00:36:10,094 --> 00:36:12,893
Woo Ri, I found another one.

625
00:36:12,894 --> 00:36:15,363
Bbikku camped out in front of this house...

626
00:36:15,364 --> 00:36:18,034
asking for an interview so they couldn't have a normal life.

627
00:36:18,105 --> 00:36:21,534
Me too. The more I search, the more I find these stories.

628
00:36:21,675 --> 00:36:24,275
He's made so many mistakes during his live broadcast.

629
00:36:24,474 --> 00:36:27,114
He's made vulgar speeches and belittled weaker people.

630
00:36:27,744 --> 00:36:29,714
Why are people watching his streams?

631
00:36:29,715 --> 00:36:31,815
Exactly. They should be watching my dramas.

632
00:36:34,715 --> 00:36:35,954
Let's talk.

633
00:36:36,585 --> 00:36:39,255
I told you I had nothing to say to you.

634
00:36:39,385 --> 00:36:41,155
Seriously.

635
00:36:41,925 --> 00:36:43,664
You think you can be responsible for what you just said?

636
00:36:43,864 --> 00:36:46,064
Watch what you say.

637
00:36:46,065 --> 00:36:48,433
- What is your problem? - You really don't know?

638
00:36:48,434 --> 00:36:50,634
Who are you to say such things to others?

639
00:36:50,635 --> 00:36:52,504
You don't really want the baby.

640
00:36:52,505 --> 00:36:53,973
You keep on lying.

641
00:36:53,974 --> 00:36:56,105
What do you know about me?

642
00:36:56,375 --> 00:36:57,704
What?

643
00:36:58,445 --> 00:37:02,544
Team Leader Lee, what's wrong? You should calm down.

644
00:37:02,545 --> 00:37:04,085
I'm a director!

645
00:37:04,315 --> 00:37:06,984
Yes, Director Lee.

646
00:37:06,985 --> 00:37:09,054
Why don't you relax a bit...

647
00:37:09,284 --> 00:37:11,025
and talk later?

648
00:37:11,784 --> 00:37:15,255
You just wait and watch what I do next.

649
00:37:22,494 --> 00:37:26,034
Woo Ri, no. This is not the time.

650
00:37:30,474 --> 00:37:32,274
What brings you here?

651
00:37:32,275 --> 00:37:34,714
- I'm here to fix the water pipes. - Okay.

652
00:37:34,715 --> 00:37:35,715
Yes.

653
00:37:44,085 --> 00:37:45,554
Where could it be? Gosh.

654
00:37:52,065 --> 00:37:54,434
Don't do it. Why?

655
00:37:55,594 --> 00:37:56,764
Come on.

656
00:37:57,764 --> 00:37:59,235
Why are you back? Why?

657
00:37:59,335 --> 00:38:01,934
You think I wouldn't know if you come in like this?

658
00:38:02,105 --> 00:38:04,644
We have a security system, you know.

659
00:38:05,304 --> 00:38:08,045
I told you this before and this is too much.

660
00:38:08,175 --> 00:38:09,244
Please, leave.

661
00:38:09,375 --> 00:38:12,783
Sir, we really need to find the evidence in this room.

662
00:38:12,784 --> 00:38:16,215
But they won't issue a search warrant.

663
00:38:16,885 --> 00:38:19,425
There's a real dangerous criminal in this hospital.

664
00:38:19,684 --> 00:38:21,093
What is wrong with you?

665
00:38:21,094 --> 00:38:22,754
There isn't a person like that in the hospital.

666
00:38:22,755 --> 00:38:24,464
Two of your employees died.

667
00:38:24,465 --> 00:38:25,724
You said that was...

668
00:38:26,224 --> 00:38:28,434
because of gambling loans.

669
00:38:28,934 --> 00:38:30,734
Don't make a scene here and leave.

670
00:38:30,735 --> 00:38:33,534
We could get into trouble if the patients come back.

671
00:38:35,034 --> 00:38:36,875
Where did he go? What about the floor?

672
00:38:39,744 --> 00:38:42,014
- Leave. - I can't.

673
00:38:44,815 --> 00:38:45,815
Leave.

674
00:38:46,344 --> 00:38:47,554
I can't!

675
00:38:47,684 --> 00:38:49,585
(Open)

676
00:38:54,755 --> 00:38:56,695
What is this?

677
00:38:57,164 --> 00:38:59,364
Detective!

678
00:38:59,695 --> 00:39:00,835
Detective Lee.

679
00:39:07,675 --> 00:39:08,735
What is this?

680
00:39:13,474 --> 00:39:14,715
This was for real.

681
00:39:15,215 --> 00:39:17,114
Is this where that guy disappeared to?

682
00:39:18,445 --> 00:39:21,684
Chairman Kim is like a ghost. It's hard to detect his shadows.

683
00:39:22,054 --> 00:39:24,724
I'm sorry Kang Jae for not believing in you.

684
00:39:25,385 --> 00:39:27,525
I should have trusted my detective's hunch.

685
00:39:28,295 --> 00:39:29,394
Let's report this.

686
00:39:29,494 --> 00:39:31,764
Let's report it and do an official investigation.

687
00:39:32,324 --> 00:39:33,534
Not yet.

688
00:39:34,094 --> 00:39:35,664
We need to prove what they did here...

689
00:39:36,164 --> 00:39:38,605
and what connection there is to Chairman Kim.

690
00:39:39,804 --> 00:39:42,875
Otherwise, this is nothing more than an illegal extension.

691
00:39:43,704 --> 00:39:45,005
Have you found something?

692
00:39:46,474 --> 00:39:47,875
They got rid of everything.

693
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:50,113
What did they do here?

694
00:39:50,114 --> 00:39:52,045
They probably smuggled in the ingredients...

695
00:39:53,144 --> 00:39:54,755
and synthesized drugs.

696
00:39:54,985 --> 00:39:57,385
Right. Chairman Kim is all about drugs.

697
00:39:57,724 --> 00:40:01,425
But there wasn't a tip about him distributing new drugs.

698
00:40:03,195 --> 00:40:05,094
If we interrogate a few junkies, they'll tell us.

699
00:40:05,925 --> 00:40:07,394
Now, we can catch Chairman Kim.

700
00:40:08,835 --> 00:40:10,565
"Chairman Kim"?

701
00:40:15,005 --> 00:40:16,704
Goodness.

702
00:40:17,045 --> 00:40:18,074
Darn it.

703
00:40:18,905 --> 00:40:20,144
- Are you all right? - Yes.

704
00:40:21,775 --> 00:40:23,014
Who is "Chairman Kim"?

705
00:40:25,485 --> 00:40:26,654
It's nothing.

706
00:40:26,655 --> 00:40:28,814
Did you really not know about this space?

707
00:40:28,815 --> 00:40:31,784
No. My team upstairs is looking into it,

708
00:40:32,324 --> 00:40:33,795
so I'll let you know what we find out.

709
00:40:35,195 --> 00:40:36,295
Okay.

710
00:40:40,695 --> 00:40:42,034
Do you know who "Chairman Kim" is?

711
00:40:42,065 --> 00:40:43,534
Which Chairman Kim? I know plenty.

712
00:40:43,605 --> 00:40:46,134
I think this "Chairman Kim" has done some illegal stuff.

713
00:40:46,135 --> 00:40:48,735
I know a truckload of outlaws who go by that name. Which one?

714
00:40:48,835 --> 00:40:50,474
Well, the detective said earlier...

715
00:40:51,074 --> 00:40:54,314
that someone called "Chairman Kim" might have something to do with it.

716
00:40:54,315 --> 00:40:57,184
I told you to keep that detective in check.

717
00:40:57,585 --> 00:40:59,384
He clearly has it out for us.

718
00:40:59,385 --> 00:41:01,184
He's trying to ruin the hospital's reputation!

719
00:41:06,795 --> 00:41:09,824
I suppose they don't know I served in the special forces.

720
00:41:11,664 --> 00:41:13,224
A piece of wire...

721
00:41:13,965 --> 00:41:16,905
is all I need to get out of handcuffs like these.

722
00:41:17,635 --> 00:41:20,775
I always carry one around for situations like this.

723
00:41:30,014 --> 00:41:33,144
Just straighten a paper clip like this.

724
00:41:34,054 --> 00:41:35,613
- Like this. - Nice.

725
00:41:35,614 --> 00:41:38,155
Straighten it out like this.

726
00:41:38,355 --> 00:41:42,094
You need a strong grip to be able to do this.

727
00:41:42,224 --> 00:41:44,224
Once it's all straight like this,

728
00:41:44,525 --> 00:41:47,364
find the lock on the handcuff right here.

729
00:41:47,994 --> 00:41:49,264
Then...

730
00:41:49,534 --> 00:41:50,804
- insert it into the hole. - Mom!

731
00:41:52,364 --> 00:41:54,235
And you'll hear the click...

732
00:41:56,034 --> 00:41:57,905
Hey, I was watching that.

733
00:41:58,405 --> 00:41:59,704
Shut your mouth.

734
00:41:59,804 --> 00:42:00,945
Ma Ri.

735
00:42:01,114 --> 00:42:03,343
I was enjoying the show. How could you just turn it off?

736
00:42:03,344 --> 00:42:05,444
This is not nice. I was watching the show!

737
00:42:05,445 --> 00:42:07,884
Gosh, why are you two fighting again?

738
00:42:07,885 --> 00:42:09,414
Just let him watch it.

739
00:42:09,655 --> 00:42:11,355
Keep your mouth shut and just watch TV.

740
00:42:12,155 --> 00:42:13,155
Mom.

741
00:42:13,394 --> 00:42:15,454
I'm so angry right now!

742
00:42:16,594 --> 00:42:18,695
I thought everything was going well. What should I do?

743
00:42:19,195 --> 00:42:22,194
Maybe we shouldn't have said that to the chairman. What do we do?

744
00:42:22,195 --> 00:42:23,664
What are you talking about?

745
00:42:23,934 --> 00:42:26,235
- Sit down and explain. - Are you all right?

746
00:42:26,565 --> 00:42:28,274
Darn it!

747
00:42:28,275 --> 00:42:30,803
That scene is over. I can't believe this!

748
00:42:30,804 --> 00:42:31,945
Hey.

749
00:42:32,605 --> 00:42:33,843
Be quiet, will you?

750
00:42:33,844 --> 00:42:37,385
Why? Why did you have to turn off the TV right at that moment?

751
00:42:38,184 --> 00:42:41,514
You idiot. Shut your mouth before I kill you!

752
00:42:42,014 --> 00:42:44,585
Stop messing with me!

753
00:42:50,565 --> 00:42:51,724
Oh Woo Ri.

754
00:42:52,824 --> 00:42:54,264
Just wait until I find some dirt on you.

755
00:42:54,994 --> 00:42:57,235
I will chew you to pieces.

756
00:43:04,545 --> 00:43:06,573
- Where is she? - It's getting late.

757
00:43:06,574 --> 00:43:08,944
- Just wait. She'll be here soon. - When?

758
00:43:08,945 --> 00:43:10,884
- It's chilly. - I'm freezing!

759
00:43:10,885 --> 00:43:13,085
- When will Maria be here? - I'm not even wearing a jacket!

760
00:43:14,155 --> 00:43:17,053
- We've been waiting for hours! - Keep waiting.

761
00:43:17,054 --> 00:43:18,954
- How much longer? - It's been hours.

762
00:43:19,824 --> 00:43:21,294
- Seriously. - Come on.

763
00:43:21,295 --> 00:43:22,795
Hey! What's the matter with...

764
00:43:23,494 --> 00:43:24,824
- There she is! Maria! - What?

765
00:43:24,965 --> 00:43:26,394
- Where? - Maria!

766
00:43:26,664 --> 00:43:29,093
- Could I please interview you? - Can you give me a hug?

767
00:43:29,094 --> 00:43:33,033
- Maria, let me hold your hand! - Me too! Hold my hand!

768
00:43:33,034 --> 00:43:35,303
- Hold on. Excuse me! - Maria!

769
00:43:35,304 --> 00:43:36,634
I'm the director of "Curious Stories".

770
00:43:36,635 --> 00:43:37,644
Are you Oh Woo Ri?

771
00:43:37,704 --> 00:43:38,774
I'm from "PD Note".

772
00:43:38,775 --> 00:43:40,545
Is it true that you're pregnant when you're a virgin?

773
00:43:45,485 --> 00:43:48,085
Please give me some time. I'll explain everything.

774
00:43:49,684 --> 00:43:50,985
Get out of my way.

775
00:43:51,255 --> 00:43:52,354
- Wait! - Maria!

776
00:43:52,355 --> 00:43:53,924
- Woo Ri! - Just a comment, please!

777
00:43:53,925 --> 00:43:55,553
Guys, did you see that?

778
00:43:55,554 --> 00:43:57,664
Even people from the national TV networks are here.

779
00:43:57,824 --> 00:43:59,864
I scored big today!

780
00:44:01,065 --> 00:44:02,794
My gosh.

781
00:44:02,795 --> 00:44:04,864
What is this ruckus?

782
00:44:05,105 --> 00:44:06,804
There are even more people here now.

783
00:44:07,235 --> 00:44:08,905
Even TV reporters are here?

784
00:44:12,844 --> 00:44:14,344
I contacted the TV networks.

785
00:44:15,114 --> 00:44:17,114
What? What do you mean?

786
00:44:17,385 --> 00:44:19,584
Will you agree to their interview requests? Don't.

787
00:44:19,585 --> 00:44:20,855
Raphael is here.

788
00:44:23,784 --> 00:44:24,855
Ms. Oh.

789
00:44:25,355 --> 00:44:27,093
Oh, what brings you by?

790
00:44:27,094 --> 00:44:28,394
I stopped by because I was worried,

791
00:44:28,625 --> 00:44:30,195
but it's gotten even worse than earlier.

792
00:44:30,764 --> 00:44:32,424
This is getting out of control.

793
00:44:32,425 --> 00:44:35,494
I even called the police, but they were useless.

794
00:44:35,594 --> 00:44:37,203
I booked a room at a hotel.

795
00:44:37,204 --> 00:44:38,604
Stay there for a few days.

796
00:44:38,605 --> 00:44:42,074
If no one is here, they'll leave soon.

797
00:44:42,675 --> 00:44:45,045
Thank you for trying to help,

798
00:44:45,445 --> 00:44:48,275
but I don't think that will solve anything.

799
00:44:48,815 --> 00:44:50,614
I can take care of this.

800
00:44:50,945 --> 00:44:53,014
What are you planning to do?

801
00:44:57,885 --> 00:44:59,085
Hello?

802
00:44:59,385 --> 00:45:01,894
Oh, yes. You'll be here soon?

803
00:45:02,094 --> 00:45:03,494
Okay.

804
00:45:06,894 --> 00:45:08,195
- What? - Ms. Oh!

805
00:45:09,635 --> 00:45:11,803
- Look! She came out. - Maria!

806
00:45:11,804 --> 00:45:13,534
- Maria! - Just a comment, please!

807
00:45:19,775 --> 00:45:20,945
Everyone.

808
00:45:21,244 --> 00:45:22,474
Do you want a miracle?

809
00:45:22,574 --> 00:45:23,985
- Yes! - Yes!

810
00:45:24,085 --> 00:45:25,114
Miracles...

811
00:45:26,585 --> 00:45:27,684
do not happen.

812
00:45:27,784 --> 00:45:28,854
- What? - Why not?

813
00:45:28,855 --> 00:45:30,424
- What's she saying? - Why not?

814
00:45:30,425 --> 00:45:32,683
The person who should be in the spotlight now isn't me.

815
00:45:32,684 --> 00:45:35,594
It's him, the man who creates victims like me!

816
00:45:36,155 --> 00:45:38,124
- Bbikku? - Bbikku?

817
00:45:38,125 --> 00:45:39,565
- Bbikku? - Why?

818
00:45:39,994 --> 00:45:42,894
All you TV reporters, I'll give you an idea for a great story.

819
00:45:43,065 --> 00:45:44,703
Here, I have a list of all the unsavory events...

820
00:45:44,704 --> 00:45:47,275
involving Bbikku and his controversial video channel.

821
00:45:49,005 --> 00:45:50,445
- I want one too. - What is this?

822
00:45:50,505 --> 00:45:51,574
- Here! - What did he do?

823
00:45:51,875 --> 00:45:54,314
I summarized the details of all the problems...

824
00:45:54,315 --> 00:45:56,814
and controversies he's caused and the complaints about him posted...

825
00:45:56,815 --> 00:45:58,684
by those who suffered because of him in the past.

826
00:45:59,284 --> 00:46:01,183
- Look at this. - My goodness.

827
00:46:01,184 --> 00:46:02,354
- Hey. - Gosh! Did you read this?

828
00:46:02,355 --> 00:46:06,125
The victims who suffered unjustly because of him are here.

829
00:46:07,954 --> 00:46:11,864
He wrongfully accused us of serving leftovers at our restaurant.

830
00:46:12,824 --> 00:46:14,594
The restaurant is about to shut down!

831
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:17,433
He beat me up, saying he had to teach a high school kid a lesson...

832
00:46:17,434 --> 00:46:18,764
for smoking.

833
00:46:19,335 --> 00:46:20,775
I'm an adult.

834
00:46:21,605 --> 00:46:23,274
He ordered fried chicken and complained in his live broadcast...

835
00:46:23,275 --> 00:46:25,344
that we intentionally left out drumsticks.

836
00:46:26,644 --> 00:46:27,644
It was not true.

837
00:46:28,045 --> 00:46:29,913
- What? - Let me explain!

838
00:46:29,914 --> 00:46:30,914
That's horrible.

839
00:46:30,915 --> 00:46:33,084
There are many other victims.

840
00:46:33,085 --> 00:46:34,784
Some have already sued him.

841
00:46:35,614 --> 00:46:38,655
I understand that it's his personal video channel, but is it okay...

842
00:46:39,355 --> 00:46:41,953
to do this just to grab people's attention?

843
00:46:41,954 --> 00:46:44,323
- Bbikku! - The newsroom should cover this.

844
00:46:44,324 --> 00:46:47,533
- Bbikku, can we interview you? - Sorry?

845
00:46:47,534 --> 00:46:50,533
The things on this list and what they said. Is it all true?

846
00:46:50,534 --> 00:46:51,964
Hey, put your cameras away.

847
00:46:51,965 --> 00:46:54,574
It's illegal to show my face without my consent!

848
00:46:54,905 --> 00:46:56,504
- Do you not admit it? - Turn your cameras off!

849
00:46:56,505 --> 00:46:58,243
- Darn it. - Do you admit everything?

850
00:46:58,244 --> 00:46:59,643
- Is it true? - Tell us!

851
00:46:59,644 --> 00:47:01,114
Tell us, Bbikku!

852
00:47:01,244 --> 00:47:02,344
The police are here.

853
00:47:02,914 --> 00:47:04,585
- What? - What's going on?

854
00:47:05,485 --> 00:47:07,514
- Hold on. - Make way.

855
00:47:07,715 --> 00:47:09,013
- Coming through. - Excuse me.

856
00:47:09,014 --> 00:47:10,885
- Make way. - Excuse me, coming through.

857
00:47:11,385 --> 00:47:13,183
- Mr. Park Chang Soo? - Yes.

858
00:47:13,184 --> 00:47:15,093
You had drinks at Night Pocha on the 21st, right?

859
00:47:15,094 --> 00:47:16,094
Yes, I did.

860
00:47:16,095 --> 00:47:18,493
They filed a report for vandalism. You'll have to come with us.

861
00:47:18,494 --> 00:47:19,593
What? They did?

862
00:47:19,594 --> 00:47:21,795
Guys! The cops are taking me again.

863
00:47:21,894 --> 00:47:25,033
Don't you worry. This can't bring me down.

864
00:47:25,034 --> 00:47:27,974
I was totally fine even when they tased me, you know?

865
00:47:28,474 --> 00:47:30,743
- Thanks for the tokens! - Just a comment, please!

866
00:47:30,744 --> 00:47:33,445
- So is it all true? - A comment, please!

867
00:47:33,715 --> 00:47:35,175
- Get in the car. - Oh, hold on.

868
00:47:35,545 --> 00:47:37,385
- Get in. - Gosh.

869
00:47:42,255 --> 00:47:43,554
So it's all true?

870
00:47:43,655 --> 00:47:45,655
I can't believe this.

871
00:47:46,425 --> 00:47:48,724
Everyone must leave at once.

872
00:47:49,195 --> 00:47:50,494
We've received a complaint.

873
00:47:51,025 --> 00:47:52,565
Leave at once.

874
00:47:53,695 --> 00:47:57,505
The police can use force to maintain public order and ensure safety.

875
00:47:57,864 --> 00:47:59,505
Leave at once.

876
00:47:59,934 --> 00:48:01,005
Let's just go.

877
00:48:11,244 --> 00:48:12,414
Let's go.

878
00:48:19,655 --> 00:48:20,823
Yes.

879
00:48:20,824 --> 00:48:22,394
Thank you so much.

880
00:48:23,054 --> 00:48:24,724
- I'll be in touch. - Okay.

881
00:48:24,894 --> 00:48:26,025
Bye.

882
00:48:26,994 --> 00:48:28,934
- Thank you for coming. - Well done.

883
00:48:31,704 --> 00:48:33,364
Good riddance!

884
00:48:33,905 --> 00:48:35,375
Now, I can breathe.

885
00:48:35,534 --> 00:48:37,344
They all left in a flash.

886
00:48:37,445 --> 00:48:38,974
I'm almost sad that they left so quickly.

887
00:48:40,304 --> 00:48:41,743
You took care of it in one blow.

888
00:48:41,744 --> 00:48:42,844
You rock.

889
00:48:44,344 --> 00:48:46,715
Thank you. I'm glad it went well.

890
00:48:46,914 --> 00:48:48,414
I'm so relieved.

891
00:48:48,985 --> 00:48:50,984
Raphael, have you eaten yet?

892
00:48:50,985 --> 00:48:52,184
Stay for dinner.

893
00:48:53,324 --> 00:48:54,554
Well...

894
00:48:54,755 --> 00:48:55,953
We have no rice left.

895
00:48:55,954 --> 00:48:57,823
Come on. We can whip up something.

896
00:48:57,824 --> 00:48:59,194
Come on in.

897
00:48:59,195 --> 00:49:01,094
- Let's go inside. Come on. - Mom.

898
00:49:01,335 --> 00:49:02,434
Well, I'm...

899
00:49:04,835 --> 00:49:05,905
Should I stay...

900
00:49:10,105 --> 00:49:11,505
Excuse me.

901
00:49:17,014 --> 00:49:18,484
(We support Oh Woo Ri Maria!)

902
00:49:18,485 --> 00:49:19,985
Is it really not true?

903
00:49:22,155 --> 00:49:23,585
I'm sorry, ma'am.

904
00:49:25,855 --> 00:49:27,085
All right, then.

905
00:49:39,565 --> 00:49:40,704
Ma'am.

906
00:49:43,505 --> 00:49:45,744
What's the matter?

907
00:49:58,724 --> 00:50:01,154
This little child is putting up with treatment...

908
00:50:01,155 --> 00:50:02,724
that even adults struggle to endure.

909
00:50:03,295 --> 00:50:04,465
Ma'am.

910
00:50:05,025 --> 00:50:07,594
I can't make miracles happen.

911
00:50:08,534 --> 00:50:10,635
I cannot give you false hope.

912
00:50:10,835 --> 00:50:12,364
I know.

913
00:50:12,864 --> 00:50:15,574
But still, could you please give Min Ji a hug just once?

914
00:50:15,704 --> 00:50:19,505
If that cheers her up even just a little,

915
00:50:19,574 --> 00:50:21,045
I'll be happy.

916
00:50:26,244 --> 00:50:28,884
Grandma, who is she?

917
00:50:28,885 --> 00:50:31,254
Oh, this lady here...

918
00:50:31,255 --> 00:50:33,684
wanted to meet you, so I brought her here.

919
00:50:40,894 --> 00:50:42,295
Hi, Min Ji.

920
00:50:43,695 --> 00:50:47,105
Min Ji, I'm Catholic too.

921
00:50:47,375 --> 00:50:50,235
I'll pray for you so you can stay strong.

922
00:50:51,804 --> 00:50:53,004
Be strong.

923
00:50:53,005 --> 00:50:54,945
Thank you.

924
00:51:11,664 --> 00:51:14,635
You actually made a miracle happen.

925
00:51:15,465 --> 00:51:16,534
What?

926
00:51:16,594 --> 00:51:20,434
Showing strangers that you care and want to help.

927
00:51:20,704 --> 00:51:22,005
That creates a miracle.

928
00:51:24,175 --> 00:51:26,074
I really want to do something to help her.

929
00:51:27,244 --> 00:51:29,844
I wish I could make a miracle happen.

930
00:51:29,875 --> 00:51:31,985
I told you. You already did.

931
00:51:33,344 --> 00:51:35,553
I made some calls.

932
00:51:35,554 --> 00:51:37,783
There are some organizations that are happy to help.

933
00:51:37,784 --> 00:51:39,624
And Diamond Medical Foundation...

934
00:51:39,625 --> 00:51:43,053
has some funds set aside for children with rare diseases.

935
00:51:43,054 --> 00:51:44,764
We decided to use it for Min Ji.

936
00:51:44,894 --> 00:51:47,094
It looks like she can undergo surgery soon.

937
00:51:47,224 --> 00:51:48,534
I'm so happy for her.

938
00:51:50,195 --> 00:51:51,465
Raphael.

939
00:51:51,905 --> 00:51:54,404
You made a miracle happen.

940
00:51:54,405 --> 00:51:56,634
My gosh, I didn't even do anything.

941
00:51:56,635 --> 00:51:58,574
It was all you.

942
00:51:58,704 --> 00:52:01,343
You know, we have to use up the fund anyway...

943
00:52:01,344 --> 00:52:03,444
to reduce our taxes and stuff.

944
00:52:03,445 --> 00:52:06,585
We pay a lot of taxes...

945
00:52:07,144 --> 00:52:09,985
What? Do I have something on my face?

946
00:52:12,824 --> 00:52:16,755
You're so nice to me these days.

947
00:52:18,065 --> 00:52:21,735
You show up like a superhero and help me.

948
00:52:23,534 --> 00:52:26,905
Of course, I know you're trying to help the baby, not me.

949
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:29,574
But still, thank you so much.

950
00:52:32,344 --> 00:52:33,545
Well...

951
00:52:34,815 --> 00:52:38,144
It did start with the baby,

952
00:52:38,885 --> 00:52:40,545
but to tell you the truth...

953
00:52:42,914 --> 00:52:45,255
- Ms. Oh. - Yes?

954
00:52:46,324 --> 00:52:48,224
I think I...

955
00:52:49,295 --> 00:52:51,394
Oh, you're still here.

956
00:52:52,094 --> 00:52:54,093
- Here, take this. - What is this?

957
00:52:54,094 --> 00:52:55,294
Rice punch.

958
00:52:55,295 --> 00:52:58,604
I made it myself because Min Ji loves it.

959
00:52:58,605 --> 00:53:01,134
Keep it in the fridge so you can drink it cold.

960
00:53:01,135 --> 00:53:03,275
You don't have to give me anything.

961
00:53:03,635 --> 00:53:04,675
Take it.

962
00:53:07,074 --> 00:53:09,045
Thank you. I know I'll enjoy this.

963
00:53:09,375 --> 00:53:10,643
Please cheer up.

964
00:53:10,644 --> 00:53:13,184
Lots of good things will happen from now on.

965
00:53:13,585 --> 00:53:15,914
Thank you for coming all the way here.

966
00:53:16,014 --> 00:53:18,855
You must be busy. I'm sorry for taking your time.

967
00:53:20,284 --> 00:53:22,854
I should thank your boyfriend too. Thank you.

968
00:53:22,855 --> 00:53:24,894
Oh, I'm...

969
00:53:26,164 --> 00:53:28,065
I'm not her boyfriend.

970
00:53:36,735 --> 00:53:38,304
(Singing School With Eun Ran)

971
00:54:32,864 --> 00:54:35,194
Eun Ran, this is for you.

972
00:54:35,195 --> 00:54:37,394
I saw these flowers on my way here, and they reminded me of you.

973
00:54:38,835 --> 00:54:41,504
My gosh, thank you. They're beautiful.

974
00:54:41,505 --> 00:54:43,074
- Do you like them? - Yes.

975
00:54:48,545 --> 00:54:49,945
Hello.

976
00:54:51,085 --> 00:54:54,154
- Hello. - Oh, what brings you by?

977
00:54:54,155 --> 00:54:56,013
I'm here to see you, Gwi Nyeo.

978
00:54:56,014 --> 00:54:57,823
How do you know my name?

979
00:54:57,824 --> 00:55:00,585
People at the Senior Welfare Center told me.

980
00:55:00,655 --> 00:55:01,724
I see.

981
00:55:02,094 --> 00:55:03,694
I came to return this to you.

982
00:55:03,695 --> 00:55:04,994
I see.

983
00:55:06,625 --> 00:55:08,735
And here. Take this.

984
00:55:08,894 --> 00:55:10,263
What is this?

985
00:55:10,264 --> 00:55:12,404
Aren't the roses so beautiful?

986
00:55:12,405 --> 00:55:13,734
Why are you giving me flowers?

987
00:55:13,735 --> 00:55:17,235
Men give women flowers when they want to impress them.

988
00:55:18,074 --> 00:55:21,045
I wanted to impress you.

989
00:55:25,644 --> 00:55:28,054
My gosh. What's wrong, Gwi Nyeo?

990
00:55:28,085 --> 00:55:31,655
In my 69 years of life as a woman,

991
00:55:33,385 --> 00:55:35,755
no one has given me flowers before.

992
00:55:38,394 --> 00:55:40,295
I'm so glad I brought them.

993
00:55:55,514 --> 00:55:56,874
How beautiful.

994
00:55:56,875 --> 00:55:59,985
- I'm home. - Hey, you.

995
00:56:00,385 --> 00:56:02,585
What? What's with all the flowers?

996
00:56:02,985 --> 00:56:04,223
Did you go to the flower market today?

997
00:56:04,224 --> 00:56:06,584
A man gave me these flowers.

998
00:56:06,585 --> 00:56:08,553
Really? What about you, Grandma?

999
00:56:08,554 --> 00:56:11,364
Same here. Someone gave them to me as a gift.

1000
00:56:11,494 --> 00:56:13,093
What? Who?

1001
00:56:13,094 --> 00:56:14,864
A man!

1002
00:56:15,335 --> 00:56:17,195
Woo Ri, your grandma's got a boyfriend.

1003
00:56:17,335 --> 00:56:19,204
Really? Who?

1004
00:56:19,434 --> 00:56:20,564
You don't know him.

1005
00:56:20,565 --> 00:56:22,375
A gentleman I met at the Senior Welfare Center.

1006
00:56:34,114 --> 00:56:36,684
I'll give you a ride when you need to go anywhere because of the baby.

1007
00:56:36,815 --> 00:56:39,784
"No, don't worry. It's okay." Don't say stuff like that.

1008
00:56:40,554 --> 00:56:41,594
Okay.

1009
00:56:42,994 --> 00:56:44,723
By the way, why did you pull over?

1010
00:56:44,724 --> 00:56:47,394
I just thought that the sunset looked so beautiful.

1011
00:56:47,695 --> 00:56:49,364
Let's get out and admire it just for a minute.

1012
00:56:51,405 --> 00:56:52,405
But...

1013
00:57:16,525 --> 00:57:18,394
Ms. Oh, I've been meaning to tell you something...

1014
00:57:19,065 --> 00:57:22,335
but couldn't find the right time to tell you.

1015
00:57:22,764 --> 00:57:23,934
What is it?

1016
00:57:26,105 --> 00:57:27,735
I think I...

1017
00:57:38,085 --> 00:57:40,144
Actually, never mind.

1018
00:57:40,344 --> 00:57:42,284
I just realized there was something more important.

1019
00:57:43,355 --> 00:57:46,255
Doing my best as the father of the baby.

1020
00:57:48,195 --> 00:57:50,525
Let's be there for each other, okay?

1021
00:57:50,695 --> 00:57:51,764
Okay.

1022
00:58:34,304 --> 00:58:36,204
Is this...

1023
00:58:37,905 --> 00:58:39,144
a dream?

1024
00:59:21,614 --> 00:59:24,315
(Woori the Virgin)

1025
00:59:24,385 --> 00:59:26,053
Then we're a couple now.

1026
00:59:26,054 --> 00:59:28,454
Can I take some time and think about it?

1027
00:59:28,554 --> 00:59:29,723
I miss her.

1028
00:59:29,724 --> 00:59:31,464
I'm against them dating.

1029
00:59:31,465 --> 00:59:34,734
Everything's fine when it's just the two of us.

1030
00:59:34,735 --> 00:59:38,234
I think this is my first time introducing my boyfriend to my mom.

1031
00:59:38,235 --> 00:59:40,033
Father, the lady you're seeing is...

1032
00:59:40,034 --> 00:59:42,104
I don't have to call you "Ms. Oh" anymore, right?

1033
00:59:42,105 --> 00:59:44,104
Because I like you.

1034
00:59:44,105 --> 00:59:46,073
Who likes whom?

1035
00:59:46,074 --> 00:59:47,544
I'll secure evidence and find out...

1036
00:59:47,545 --> 00:59:49,013
what Chairman Kim did at the hospital.

1037
00:59:49,014 --> 00:59:51,784
They'll break up if the baby is gone, right?

1038
00:59:56,755 --> 01:00:00,784
