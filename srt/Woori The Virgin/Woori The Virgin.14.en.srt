00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,499
Woo Ri.

10
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,469
You must go first. Make up your mind.

11
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:41,740
Well...

12
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,350
Actually, I already made up my mind.

13
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,219
You did? Who is it?

14
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:53,420
I've...

15
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:58,190
decided...

16
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:03,529
I'll tell him tomorrow.

17
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:04,969
- Gosh. - Gosh.

18
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:09,140
It's your day today. I can't steal your thunder.

19
00:01:10,069 --> 00:01:11,809
Mom. Dad. Congratulations on your engagement!

20
00:01:17,179 --> 00:01:18,509
Enjoy the food.

21
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,819
It will all end tomorrow.

22
00:01:24,289 --> 00:01:26,549
- Enjoy the food. - I won't have to see you again.

23
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:27,989
You were sort of growing on me.

24
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,690
I thought you would be thrilled not to see me.

25
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:31,058
Once she announces her decision tomorrow,

26
00:01:31,059 --> 00:01:33,458
let's accept her decision like gentlemen.

27
00:01:33,459 --> 00:01:35,800
You took the words out of my mouth.

28
00:01:36,559 --> 00:01:38,398
Don't be pathetic or clingy.

29
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:40,269
I hope you will be a mature guy on your last day with her.

30
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:41,800
Or you'll make Woo Ri feel uncomfortable.

31
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,470
Last day? I'll keep seeing her because I'm the baby's father.

32
00:01:45,709 --> 00:01:48,139
I'll also keep seeing her because we go to the same church.

33
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:49,880
Gosh. Church.

34
00:01:51,309 --> 00:01:53,948
Hey, you guys. Did you eat a lot?

35
00:01:53,949 --> 00:01:55,949
Gosh. The food was delicious.

36
00:01:56,149 --> 00:01:58,750
Your food is the tastiest.

37
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:00,088
I'm so stuffed.

38
00:02:00,089 --> 00:02:02,418
All right. You should take some food before you leave.

39
00:02:02,419 --> 00:02:03,958
- Yes, ma'am. - Okay.

40
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:04,959
Great.

41
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:08,330
- Hey. - I didn't know.

42
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,058
All right. Let's enjoy our meal.

43
00:02:10,059 --> 00:02:11,999
- Mom. This is so good. - Mother.

44
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Mother, have some shrimp.

45
00:02:14,269 --> 00:02:15,638
- Have some shrimps. - Okay.

46
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:18,069
Let's have the shrimps and octopus. Let's eat a lot!

47
00:02:19,609 --> 00:02:21,810
- Woo Ri, have some octopus. - This one?

48
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:26,310
Are you that happy?

49
00:02:27,049 --> 00:02:30,350
Woo Ri, what about you? Did you make up your mind?

50
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,690
Are you finally ready to get married?

51
00:02:34,049 --> 00:02:35,060
Yes.

52
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:38,758
Which one is it? I'm dying out of curiosity.

53
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:40,999
Can you just tell me?

54
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,960
He will be the first one to know.

55
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,900
I haven't told anyone yet.

56
00:02:45,669 --> 00:02:47,469
We have to wait until tomorrow then.

57
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,799
I can't wait to find out!

58
00:02:53,710 --> 00:02:56,940
By the way, did I eat too much?

59
00:02:57,579 --> 00:02:58,879
Why does my stomach hurt?

60
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,978
Your stomach shouldn't hurt when you're pregnant.

61
00:03:00,979 --> 00:03:02,578
- Bring some digestive pills. - Okay.

62
00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:04,389
No. I'll take it myself.

63
00:03:04,789 --> 00:03:07,319
Go to the hospital if the pain persists. Okay?

64
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,629
Gosh. Today was a milestone for us.

65
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,660
I'll get a good night's sleep today.

66
00:03:14,359 --> 00:03:16,030
I know I'll sleep soundly tonight.

67
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,530
Hey, put on the ring.

68
00:03:18,769 --> 00:03:20,000
- Should I? - Yes.

69
00:03:20,669 --> 00:03:23,269
- It's beautiful. - How beautiful. Put that on.

70
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,638
Hello?

71
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:31,780
Good morning, Woo Ri.

72
00:03:32,009 --> 00:03:33,210
What time should we meet today?

73
00:03:33,449 --> 00:03:35,280
Should I go to your studio?

74
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:36,780
I...

75
00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:40,619
I'm getting a call.

76
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,090
I'll call you.

77
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:47,389
Hey.

78
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,129
Woo Ri. Are you at work?

79
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,970
I'm on my way to work now.

80
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:54,768
I see. Today is my day off.

81
00:03:54,769 --> 00:03:57,538
I'm free all day. Call me anytime.

82
00:03:57,539 --> 00:04:00,910
- Okay? - Okay. I'll call you.

83
00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:04,280
You have appendicitis.

84
00:04:04,609 --> 00:04:05,850
Appendicitis?

85
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,948
I was fine yesterday.

86
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:10,948
Every patient shows different symptoms.

87
00:04:10,949 --> 00:04:12,989
Some people don't know until their appendix ruptures.

88
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:15,459
Luckily, your case isn't serious.

89
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,019
We can perform the surgery with the laparoscope.

90
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:21,428
But I'm...

91
00:04:21,429 --> 00:04:24,899
pregnant. Will that be safe for the baby?

92
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,199
I'm aware of that.

93
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,069
I know you're worried, but you need this surgery fast.

94
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,999
You'll be at a higher risk if it turns into peritonitis.

95
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,909
As for the antibiotics and pain medication,

96
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:36,139
we'll do our best to ensure your baby is safe.

97
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:39,678
But could this put my baby at risk?

98
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:42,548
The pain medication might affect the baby's breathing.

99
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:45,320
But it's a rare case. You don't have to worry.

100
00:04:49,359 --> 00:04:50,988
Woo Ri. Are you all right?

101
00:04:50,989 --> 00:04:53,529
Yes. Why are you all here?

102
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:56,229
We were your emergency contact. So we could get here fast.

103
00:04:58,570 --> 00:04:59,830
Mom.

104
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:03,869
I haven't been able to register for the surgery yet.

105
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:05,809
It's okay. Let's get the surgery done.

106
00:05:07,539 --> 00:05:10,080
What is it? Is there a problem, Woo Ri?

107
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:11,849
Pregnant women...

108
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,809
try not to take cold medicine unless it's really necessary.

109
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:16,619
So of course, she doesn't feel safe going into surgery like this.

110
00:05:19,289 --> 00:05:21,048
Don't worry too much.

111
00:05:21,049 --> 00:05:23,559
The doctor said it was a simple procedure. You'll be okay.

112
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,429
We'll start the anaesthesia.

113
00:05:28,999 --> 00:05:32,729
Doctor, I'm pregnant.

114
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:35,369
Yes, I'm aware. Don't worry.

115
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:41,309
My baby will be safe, right?

116
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,379
My baby...

117
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,530
Woo Ri. How are you?

118
00:05:59,929 --> 00:06:01,330
You were brave.

119
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,330
How's my baby?

120
00:06:03,499 --> 00:06:05,669
Don't worry. The baby is perfectly fine.

121
00:06:07,429 --> 00:06:08,770
This way.

122
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:13,840
Ms. Oh, the surgery went well.

123
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:16,539
The surgery was simple because you came to the hospital early.

124
00:06:16,939 --> 00:06:20,178
Doctor, my baby is okay. Right?

125
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:21,579
Yes. The baby is perfectly fine.

126
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:24,049
You said you didn't want to take the pain medication.

127
00:06:24,689 --> 00:06:26,749
The pain will start once the anaesthesia wears off.

128
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:29,319
There's a very low chance of affecting the baby.

129
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,020
So don't endure the pain. And get the medication if it hurts.

130
00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:33,058
Don't worry.

131
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,359
It was a simple procedure, and it went well.

132
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:37,869
We'll observe her, and if her post-op looks good,

133
00:06:37,999 --> 00:06:39,369
she'll get discharged even tomorrow.

134
00:06:40,499 --> 00:06:42,999
- Okay. Thank you, doctor. - Thank you.

135
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:52,049
- Gosh. Be careful. - Let's be careful.

136
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:56,918
Ms. Oh, let us know if it hurts too much.

137
00:06:56,919 --> 00:06:58,219
We can give you medication for that.

138
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,419
I'm okay.

139
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:02,288
Are you sure walking around like this...

140
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:04,559
instead of lying down is better for her recovery?

141
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,629
Moving around is good for her bowels.

142
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:08,929
But it will be tough without the pain medication.

143
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:11,059
I'm fine.

144
00:07:11,499 --> 00:07:13,069
Woo Ri.

145
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,569
If it's too tough on you, you should just get the pain meds.

146
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:15,840
She said it was fine.

147
00:07:17,239 --> 00:07:18,509
Yes, Woo Ri.

148
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:21,510
If you're in constant pain, it might not be good for the baby.

149
00:07:25,249 --> 00:07:26,479
Right.

150
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,179
- Yes. - Please.

151
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:31,689
It hurts.

152
00:07:32,989 --> 00:07:34,220
It hurts so much.

153
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:37,520
Can you give me the pain meds? It hurts!

154
00:07:37,789 --> 00:07:39,058
Stay in your room.

155
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:40,529
I'll get you the pain meds.

156
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:42,760
It hurts so much. I want the pain meds.

157
00:07:43,499 --> 00:07:45,928
And if she passes gas, let me know right away.

158
00:07:45,929 --> 00:07:47,470
- Okay. - Okay.

159
00:07:50,939 --> 00:07:52,169
What is it?

160
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:56,280
Okay. I got it.

161
00:07:56,609 --> 00:07:58,049
Kang Jae. Raphael.

162
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,178
She's grateful that you're here. But you should go.

163
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:02,220
- She has to pass gas. - Okay.

164
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:08,090
Let's go inside.

165
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,260
Woo Ri, are you all right?

166
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,558
The pain must have subsided.

167
00:08:14,559 --> 00:08:16,298
I brought your laptop but didn't know what else to grab.

168
00:08:16,299 --> 00:08:17,798
So I got everything from your desk.

169
00:08:17,799 --> 00:08:19,729
Thank you, Mom.

170
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:22,539
Mom. Grandma. You should go home now.

171
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,109
Mom, you haven't had dinner, right?

172
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,539
You didn't have lunch, did you?

173
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:33,280
Go home already. I'll be on my laptop.

(Pregnancy Journal)

176
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,450
(Sunday)

177
00:09:08,749 --> 00:09:11,519
(Thank you for a great day. I hope we'll both sleep well.)

178
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,729
(Why am I upset?)

179
00:09:21,859 --> 00:09:24,430
(And I made up with him.)

180
00:09:24,659 --> 00:09:27,529
(For the first time in my life...)

181
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:37,439
(October 19, Saturday: Mallet. I met you for the first time today.)

182
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,550
(This is you!)

183
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:46,888
(I can't still believe that I'm a mom now!)

184
00:09:46,889 --> 00:09:48,319
(But I turned him down because he wanted to marry me for you.)

185
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,758
(I'll make sure you're happy.)

186
00:09:49,759 --> 00:09:52,389
(I'll try harder for you. Thank you, Bok Dol.)

187
00:10:26,989 --> 00:10:28,460
When did you two get here?

188
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,529
Just now.

189
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:34,169
I was in the neighbourhood, so I dropped by.

190
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:36,399
I see. What time is it?

191
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:42,279
I'm all right. You two should go home.

192
00:10:42,509 --> 00:10:44,009
Let us stay a bit longer.

193
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:49,519
But what were you two doing?

194
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:04,330
By the way,

195
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:06,930
stop holding my hands.

196
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:17,210
That just now...

197
00:11:18,249 --> 00:11:19,979
That was it, right?

198
00:11:22,119 --> 00:11:23,149
Yes.

199
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,619
She's good now then.

200
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,589
Hold on.

201
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:28,859
Where are the nurse and the doctor? Hold on a second.

202
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,460
Excuse me!

203
00:11:33,129 --> 00:11:35,998
Woo Ri just passed gas!

204
00:11:35,999 --> 00:11:38,029
Gosh. Don't be so loud in the hospital.

205
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:39,129
Excuse me.

206
00:11:39,369 --> 00:11:42,239
Woo Ri just passed gas! Okay?

207
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:48,579
Thank you.

208
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,509
I probably took up a lot of your time.

209
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,709
Call me if there's anything you need.

210
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:53,849
Rest up, Woo Ri.

211
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:55,050
I'll get going.

212
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,379
Let me get that for you.

213
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:01,119
- Bye. - Bye.

214
00:12:01,149 --> 00:12:02,419
- Bye. - Okay.

215
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,659
- Get some rest. - Bye.

216
00:12:10,629 --> 00:12:12,930
- Good work. - You too.

217
00:12:14,229 --> 00:12:16,239
- Bye. - Bye.

218
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,310
- Sweet dreams. - Rest up.

219
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,540
- Mom. - Yes?

220
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,279
- Grandma. - What?

221
00:12:31,749 --> 00:12:34,090
When the anaesthesia wore off, it hurt so much.

222
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:38,590
I had never felt that much pain in my life, but I held it in.

223
00:12:40,859 --> 00:12:42,399
You guys also had to...

224
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,129
endure this kind of pain because of me, right?

225
00:12:47,129 --> 00:12:49,300
I take medicine as soon as it hurts. I can't tolerate pain.

226
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,239
Right. As you should.

227
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:54,408
Woo Ri, you should take medicine right away and get shots too.

228
00:12:54,409 --> 00:12:55,879
- Right. Let's go. - Yes.

229
00:13:00,979 --> 00:13:02,119
Okay.

230
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:07,420
You're going to work?

231
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,790
You can't even take a day off?

232
00:13:08,859 --> 00:13:10,488
I have some time to finish my script.

233
00:13:10,489 --> 00:13:11,960
I'm not going to work.

234
00:13:12,129 --> 00:13:14,629
Then where are you going? You're still recovering.

235
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:16,159
I'm all recovered now.

236
00:13:18,129 --> 00:13:19,829
There was something I had to do.

237
00:13:19,830 --> 00:13:21,499
And I couldn't do that because of the surgery.

238
00:13:21,739 --> 00:13:23,170
He must be waiting.

239
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:26,070
What is this about? Is this urgent?

240
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,540
Wait.

241
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:29,540
Are you going to finally choose between them?

242
00:13:30,909 --> 00:13:32,749
Really? Is that it?

243
00:13:35,619 --> 00:13:36,820
I'm off now.

244
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:26,529
(Ten months later)

245
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:29,499
(Seo Gwi Nyeo's Pork Cutlet Renewal It will always taste the same!)

246
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,809
(Closed today)

247
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:37,109
(Seo Gwi Nyeo's Pork Cutlet)

248
00:14:38,479 --> 00:14:40,579
I'm so busy!

249
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,949
(Thank you for making it this far!)

250
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,278
Doesn't it look like her 100th birthday?

251
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,189
Come on. It's obvious this is a party for her 100th day.

252
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:47,589
- What about baekseolgi? - It's coming. So it'll be here.

253
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:49,289
It was supposed to be here over an hour ago.

254
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:51,019
What's taking them so long?

255
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:55,800
I told you to make japchae at the end. It will get soggy.

256
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:58,670
The guests should arrive soon. What are we missing?

257
00:14:58,769 --> 00:15:01,429
Exactly. I told you we should just have it at a venue.

258
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:02,768
This is her 100th day.

259
00:15:02,769 --> 00:15:04,540
My great-granddaughter's 100th day.

260
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,939
People don't celebrate the 100th day anymore.

261
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,478
Not after everything we went through.

262
00:15:08,479 --> 00:15:10,179
Come on. Cut it out.

263
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,749
Are you going to fight on a day like today?

264
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,550
Mom, go and get changed.

265
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:17,580
A white shirt and jeans. This is the dress code today.

266
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:18,820
Like me.

267
00:15:18,821 --> 00:15:21,790
It feels weird to wear jeans. Do I look okay?

268
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,618
Grandma, you look amazing.

269
00:15:23,619 --> 00:15:25,330
You're like a senior model.

270
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,988
By the way, I'm not sure...

271
00:15:26,989 --> 00:15:28,999
if we should take a family picture on a hectic day like this.

272
00:15:29,259 --> 00:15:30,658
We won't have a chance for all of us to get together...

273
00:15:30,659 --> 00:15:32,799
unless we have an occasion like this.

274
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,069
We all took pictures together at my wedding.

275
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:37,138
My daughter wasn't born then.

276
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:39,169
Your wedding is coming up soon. We can take one at your wedding.

277
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:40,669
I should be the star that day.

278
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:42,339
My daughter, Ri Woo, is the star today.

279
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,079
I'll put my daughter right in the middle.

280
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,710
And all of us can take pictures together.

281
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:46,878
Okay.

282
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:49,580
I'll go and put on a nice outfit for my granddaughter.

283
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:54,690
Maybe, I should have fried pork cutlets. It's been a while.

284
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:57,518
Grandma, we have so much food.

285
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:58,659
This will be enough.

286
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:01,858
I'm kind of sad that I don't get to fry pork cutlets these days.

287
00:16:01,859 --> 00:16:03,498
Mom is doing a great job, though.

288
00:16:03,499 --> 00:16:06,228
- And you make videos now. - Gosh.

289
00:16:06,229 --> 00:16:07,899
That's for fun.

290
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,840
Grandma. That's for fun?

291
00:16:09,999 --> 00:16:11,399
Your subscribers...

292
00:16:11,769 --> 00:16:12,869
Goodness.

293
00:16:13,009 --> 00:16:14,509
Oh, no. What should I do?

294
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:17,239
- Oh, no. Grandma. What do we do? - Look at this.

295
00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:19,148
I can wipe it off.

296
00:16:19,149 --> 00:16:20,809
No. It can't stain.

297
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:22,320
A white shirt is the dress code.

298
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:24,949
Then should I put on another white shirt?

299
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,189
I have a white blouse.

300
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:27,589
Yes. Please hurry.

301
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:28,859
- Okay. I'll go and change. - Oh, no.

302
00:16:29,889 --> 00:16:31,159
You're home, Seoung Il.

303
00:16:31,259 --> 00:16:32,359
Yes.

304
00:16:32,859 --> 00:16:35,330
Where is she going?

305
00:16:35,859 --> 00:16:37,029
- Dad. - Yes?

306
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:39,600
- What are you wearing? - What do you mean?

307
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:41,399
I'm wearing blue and white.

308
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,898
Dad, you drive me crazy sometimes.

309
00:16:43,899 --> 00:16:44,998
It's the other way around.

310
00:16:44,999 --> 00:16:47,170
A white shirt and jeans. Isn't that an obvious pairing?

311
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,638
I see.

312
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:51,949
Why did I think I should wear white pants?

313
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:55,320
This is awful. It's my daughter's first picture.

314
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,518
Gosh, why are you so worried?

315
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,648
I live here. I can go and change fast.

316
00:16:59,649 --> 00:17:01,859
I have a lot of clothes too. All right.

317
00:17:02,489 --> 00:17:04,790
Gosh. Honey, why do you look so gorgeous?

318
00:17:04,889 --> 00:17:07,190
- Mom. - What? You startled me.

319
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,958
Mom, this isn't right.

320
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:11,800
I'm wearing a white shirt and denim.

321
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:13,698
I can't see the shirt or the denim.

322
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,039
- I can only see your bare skin! - What are you talking about?

323
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:18,398
Woo Ri. You should respect her style.

324
00:17:18,399 --> 00:17:20,209
Not everyone at her age...

325
00:17:20,409 --> 00:17:22,310
can look this sexy.

326
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,279
You can wear that when it's just the two of you.

327
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,378
Mom, please wear something more elegant today.

328
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:28,579
Please? I'm begging you.

329
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:30,349
- Dad, you should go change too. - Okay.

330
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,519
Honey, let's give what Woo Ri wants today.

331
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,990
I'll go and put on a new outfit. Okay.

332
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:37,219
Gosh. I can't do this a second time.

333
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,060
By the way, where's your husband-to-be?

334
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:42,128
Shouldn't he be here now and help you?

335
00:17:42,129 --> 00:17:43,600
He should have been here a long time ago.

336
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,229
I'm here!

337
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,938
Gosh, Mother.

338
00:17:48,939 --> 00:17:51,469
You are stunning as always.

339
00:17:51,669 --> 00:17:53,039
- Mom, hurry. - Okay.

340
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:54,638
You can admire me some other time.

341
00:17:54,639 --> 00:17:56,408
- Woo Ri said no. I'll go change. - What?

342
00:17:56,409 --> 00:17:57,979
- Why? - Okay. Go and get changed.

343
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,580
She looks amazing. Why...

344
00:18:00,909 --> 00:18:02,719
What is it?

345
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:04,719
I followed the dress code.

346
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,419
Blue and white.

347
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,418
You got the colours right.

348
00:18:08,419 --> 00:18:10,290
But you don't look modest.

349
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,329
A white shirt and jeans. This is the outfit.

350
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:13,789
- No. Hear me out. - What?

351
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:17,559
Today is Ri Woo's first official appearance.

352
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,769
So I wanted to look very formal and classy.

353
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:23,299
No. I understand that. But you won't blend in.

354
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,699
You'll stand out by yourself.

355
00:18:26,669 --> 00:18:27,840
- Was it too much? - Yes.

356
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,340
Okay. Here.

357
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,350
What if I take off the jacket? Just the shirt.

358
00:18:32,409 --> 00:18:33,949
Let's unbutton that too.

359
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:36,479
Gosh. This is a bit better.

360
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,819
- That's better. - All right.

361
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,718
- Woo Ri. How do I look? Perfect? - Like this?

362
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:41,619
Dad, you changed really fast.

363
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:44,959
I should have gotten dressed up like him.

364
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:47,329
Dad, your outfit is cooler.

365
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:48,560
You look modest. It's the best!

366
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:50,530
- That looks better. - Gosh.

367
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:53,129
- Okay. There. - Hey.

368
00:18:54,699 --> 00:18:55,839
Don't even start.

369
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,000
I barely passed with this outfit.

370
00:18:58,139 --> 00:19:00,408
I mean, this is worst than the time...

371
00:19:00,409 --> 00:19:02,878
I was getting fitted for my movie. She's pickier too.

372
00:19:02,879 --> 00:19:04,979
- Gosh. All right. - Right.

373
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,379
And...

374
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:08,719
you're joining a new movie, right? I read the article.

375
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,149
Gosh. Well,

376
00:19:10,379 --> 00:19:12,489
I used to be the Korean DiCaprio in the dramas.

377
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:15,858
But now, I've become a real DiCaprio in the movies too.

378
00:19:15,859 --> 00:19:16,859
Or something like that.

379
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:20,790
- You know, - Yes?

380
00:19:21,189 --> 00:19:22,898
I want you to endorse plastic surgery...

381
00:19:22,899 --> 00:19:23,959
for the Diamond Medical Foundation.

382
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:26,369
You might turn it down if you get even more successful.

383
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:29,799
- Well, - I'm serious.

384
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:32,669
it's great to get this kind of offer from you.

385
00:19:32,909 --> 00:19:35,310
- But here's what crossed my mind. - Do tell.

386
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,080
I'm the most sought-after star now.

387
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,579
What would I gain from openly telling the public...

388
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,418
that I got plastic surgery done?

389
00:19:43,419 --> 00:19:44,750
I've been thinking about that.

390
00:19:45,889 --> 00:19:47,819
I'll give you a huge signing bonus. Okay?

391
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,218
I'm afraid that you really won't do it...

392
00:19:49,219 --> 00:19:51,059
- Woo Ri. - once you get even more famous.

393
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:54,729
I heard that the photographer you hired couldn't come today.

394
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:57,199
Oh, Dad. My morning was so hectic because of that.

395
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,368
But I was able to get a replacement at the last minute.

396
00:19:59,369 --> 00:20:01,428
- Really? - Yes. That's a relief.

397
00:20:01,429 --> 00:20:02,600
- Hey, there he is. - Okay.

398
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,540
Hello.

399
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,169
Hello. Gosh. Am I late?

400
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,378
No. You're on time, but the last one here.

401
00:20:10,379 --> 00:20:11,909
- Please hurry. - Yes.

402
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:14,878
- Here? - No, over there.

403
00:20:14,879 --> 00:20:16,280
I got it.

404
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:18,919
- Dad. - Yes.

405
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,789
- Can you go and check on Mom? - Okay. Check on Mom.

406
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:23,319
Don't let her wear her stage costume.

407
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,989
It has to be something pure and natural.

408
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,888
- Something pure and natural. - Yes.

409
00:20:26,889 --> 00:20:29,229
Pure and natural. Let's go.

410
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:30,299
- Let's go. - Okay, let's go.

411
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,070
- I'm counting on you. - Okay.

412
00:20:33,369 --> 00:20:36,639
Gosh, Raphael. You're all dressed up for today.

413
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:38,740
Gosh, Detective Lee.

414
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:42,409
I came over-dressed and feel embarrassed.

415
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:45,009
Bok Rae, you always overdo things.

416
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:47,109
Relax a bit.

417
00:20:47,409 --> 00:20:48,409
Hey.

418
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,020
It's Raphael.

419
00:20:52,290 --> 00:20:55,389
Everyone on the baseball team calls me Bok Rae because of you.

420
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:59,290
Bok Rae suits you better than Raphael.

421
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:03,500
Right, I can't make it to the match this time.

422
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:04,830
Why?

423
00:21:04,899 --> 00:21:07,129
I'm a detective, remember?

424
00:21:07,369 --> 00:21:11,769
You'll hurt yourself if you work too much since you got promoted.

425
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:13,408
Besides, if you don't go, why would I? It's no fun.

426
00:21:13,409 --> 00:21:16,939
You always chat when you meet. Are you two best friends?

427
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:18,908
- I don't like him. - I don't like him.

428
00:21:18,909 --> 00:21:20,708
- I had enough of him. - Don't be so ridiculous.

429
00:21:20,709 --> 00:21:22,049
- I had enough of him. - Seriously.

430
00:21:22,050 --> 00:21:24,079
Stop with the love fight.

431
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,378
And check the angle on the camera.

432
00:21:25,379 --> 00:21:27,290
- Quick, stand there and open it. - Yes.

433
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,290
Let's see.

434
00:21:31,719 --> 00:21:32,790
Good.

435
00:21:33,429 --> 00:21:36,829
- Yes, we'll all stand there. - Here?

436
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:38,300
Let's see. Take a look.

437
00:21:38,399 --> 00:21:39,829
How's this angle?

438
00:21:39,830 --> 00:21:41,968
- Yes, that looks good. - You like it?

439
00:21:41,969 --> 00:21:43,499
It's good because the model is good.

440
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,770
- Get out of the way. - How do I look?

441
00:21:45,669 --> 00:21:49,039
Our main star should look good. Our daughter Oh Ri Woo.

442
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:52,148
Here is our star! Ta-Da!

443
00:21:52,149 --> 00:21:54,349
Ri Woo. My daughter Ri Woo.

444
00:21:54,350 --> 00:21:57,779
You look so pretty today. Or are you just pretty?

445
00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:00,448
I made today a holiday at work for Ri Woo.

446
00:22:00,449 --> 00:22:02,119
It's okay, your daddy made it happen.

447
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,089
Gosh, you're so good at talking with the baby.

448
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,259
She can't even talk.

449
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:08,929
- What did you say? - Ta-Da! Woo Ri, how's this?

450
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:11,559
- Mom, you look so beautiful. - Do you like it?

451
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,769
Finally, your mom passed, right?

452
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:15,128
Now,

453
00:22:15,129 --> 00:22:18,668
we'll take turns and say something to Ri Woo.

454
00:22:18,669 --> 00:22:20,168
Why are you hosting all of a sudden?

455
00:22:20,169 --> 00:22:22,178
I mean, I want her to think...

456
00:22:22,179 --> 00:22:24,708
that her grandfather was good-looking later on in her life.

457
00:22:24,709 --> 00:22:25,850
That's all I want.

458
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,079
Now, Grandma.

459
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:31,079
I mean Great-grandma. Let's start.

460
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:36,590
Ri Woo, thank you for coming to us after a lot of hardship.

461
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:40,559
Be healthy and grow up well.

462
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:43,300
Yes, grow up well.

463
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:46,600
Now, my lovely wife, the Grandma.

464
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:48,070
Hi, Ri Woo.

465
00:22:48,199 --> 00:22:51,270
I have a strong feeling that you will become an idol star.

466
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:55,340
Fulfill our family dream for us.

467
00:22:55,469 --> 00:22:57,309
Pick up a microphone on your first birthday.

468
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,679
- Bye. - Yes.

469
00:22:58,949 --> 00:23:01,378
- Now, the loving Dad. - Hey, you're next.

470
00:23:01,379 --> 00:23:02,780
What? Wait...

471
00:23:05,419 --> 00:23:08,090
- You're running out of time. - Dear Ri Woo.

472
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:11,158
The 100 days I had with you...

473
00:23:11,159 --> 00:23:13,459
are nothing comparable...

474
00:23:14,129 --> 00:23:15,959
to the 34 years I lived alone.

475
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:20,369
Let's live a happy life...

476
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:22,399
together.

477
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:24,199
I love you.

478
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,739
That was touching.

479
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:29,239
The feeling a father has for his daughter.

480
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,840
You know it so well. I was thrown off.

481
00:23:32,350 --> 00:23:33,949
I love you, my daughter.

482
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:36,379
- Yes, I do. - Love you, too.

483
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:38,079
Dear Ri Woo.

484
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,419
Me?

485
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,389
Ri Woo,

486
00:23:43,119 --> 00:23:44,718
I think it was the other way around,

487
00:23:44,719 --> 00:23:46,359
and you gave birth to me.

488
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:50,030
You let me live a whole new life.

489
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,899
Thank you, Ri Woo. I love you.

490
00:23:53,199 --> 00:23:54,969
- I love you. - I love you.

491
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,599
Gosh, that was such a good time.

492
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,069
Now, for the real thing.

493
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:02,169
Right. Why don't you say a word?

494
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:05,339
Ri Woo, happy 100 days!

495
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,408
I'm...

496
00:24:06,409 --> 00:24:07,979
- Gosh, Ri Woo must be sleepy. - This isn't going to work.

497
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,819
- She slept well. Why is she whiny? - It's okay, Ri Woo.

498
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:11,549
- She's crying too much. - Let's take the picture...

499
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:12,948
- before she gets worse. - Let's do that.

500
00:24:12,949 --> 00:24:16,359
- Let's take the picture. - Let's go.

501
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:18,388
- Here. - Stand here.

502
00:24:18,389 --> 00:24:19,759
- Woo Ri. The baby. - Kang Jae.

503
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,030
- Wait. My jacket. - Yes.

504
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,000
- Here we go. - Let's take a nice picture.

505
00:24:25,199 --> 00:24:28,299
- Look over there. - Here we go.

506
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,698
- Look. - We're taking the picture.

507
00:24:29,699 --> 00:24:31,539
- Get in here. - It's ready.

508
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,139
- Get ready. - Look over there.

509
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:35,909
- One, two, three. - Cheese.

510
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,320
Woo Ri.

511
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:47,389
Kang Jae.

512
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:50,219
Kang Jae.

513
00:24:53,129 --> 00:24:54,689
What if...

514
00:24:55,129 --> 00:24:58,300
What if I didn't get pregnant,

515
00:25:00,669 --> 00:25:04,399
we would have gotten married when you proposed, right?

516
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:09,979
Then, I wouldn't have known how important you were to me...

517
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,639
for the rest of my life.

518
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:15,510
But now that...

519
00:25:16,649 --> 00:25:19,020
we have gone through so much that...

520
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:22,889
I can see clearly who you are.

521
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,159
You are someone...

522
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:30,030
who would stand by me...

523
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:34,070
whatever happens to me.

524
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:40,469
With you, I think I can do anything...

525
00:25:41,939 --> 00:25:45,109
even when I become my Mom's age and my Grandma's age.

526
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:51,719
- Woo Ri. - Kang Jae, you are my spring.

527
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:55,019
We had a passionate summer,

528
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,989
a rich fall,

529
00:25:56,990 --> 00:25:58,959
and a fierce winter.

530
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:03,399
But spring is a new start that always comes back...

531
00:26:03,959 --> 00:26:05,429
after waiting through all this.

532
00:26:27,949 --> 00:26:29,619
My warm spring.

533
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,060
Will you...

534
00:26:35,189 --> 00:26:36,560
marry me?

535
00:27:14,669 --> 00:27:16,570
- Do you like it? - Yes.

536
00:27:17,639 --> 00:27:19,740
Yes. It's just as I thought it would be.

537
00:27:20,969 --> 00:27:23,980
Now that 100th-day celebration is done,

538
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,409
we have our wedding left.

539
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:30,649
You went through so much preparing for it by yourself.

540
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:32,550
No.

541
00:27:32,889 --> 00:27:34,819
You were busy writing scripts.

542
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,688
- Woo Ri. - Yes, Dad.

543
00:27:36,689 --> 00:27:38,619
I thought about it carefully.

544
00:27:38,859 --> 00:27:41,189
But can I use your room once you move out?

545
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:44,259
Yes, sure.

546
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:49,438
When you move out, I'll renovate it into a cool study.

547
00:27:49,439 --> 00:27:51,399
- Sure. - I told you, no.

548
00:27:52,139 --> 00:27:53,839
Where would she sleep when she comes over?

549
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,909
There needs to be a room for her to visit more often.

550
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:59,479
Woo Ri, you need to come over at least once a day.

551
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,608
That's why I told you to get a house ten minutes away.

552
00:28:01,609 --> 00:28:05,480
Yes. Of course, Mom.

553
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:08,249
Father, come over to our house often.

554
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:09,418
You can read your scripts there.

555
00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:13,259
Kang Jae, I know you're just being polite.

556
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:15,129
But thank you for offering.

557
00:28:15,959 --> 00:28:17,000
Gosh.

558
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:19,129
- You have a phone call. - Right.

559
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,869
Yes, director.

560
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:26,340
Tomorrow?

561
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:28,969
- Here we go. - There, there.

562
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:31,739
I'm sorry, Raphael.

563
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:32,780
She's my daughter.

564
00:28:32,909 --> 00:28:34,580
I'm happy to babysit anytime.

565
00:28:35,149 --> 00:28:37,820
Ri Woo, let's stay with Daddy today.

566
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:41,820
Then, she'll stay with me until the wedding, right?

567
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,490
I'm so happy.

568
00:28:43,619 --> 00:28:46,089
Please take care of her. I need to go now.

569
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:47,189
You should go.

570
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:49,959
- Get going. - Okay.

571
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:54,830
Min Chae has to leave for the US tomorrow.

572
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:57,439
That's why we asked you to meet us in such a short time.

573
00:28:58,169 --> 00:28:59,939
I'm always happy to do so.

574
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,810
I enjoyed reading the script.

575
00:29:03,139 --> 00:29:05,280
- Thank you. - Thank you.

576
00:29:05,439 --> 00:29:08,148
Ms. Oh put a lot of effort into it.

577
00:29:08,149 --> 00:29:10,149
We could see that in the script.

578
00:29:11,050 --> 00:29:12,379
Everything's good...

579
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:16,060
but isn't the main character a bit annoying?

580
00:29:17,459 --> 00:29:19,830
Such characters are not in fashion these days, are they?

581
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:23,229
How about a cooler character, with a girl crush?

582
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:24,358
Min Chae also thinks that way.

583
00:29:24,359 --> 00:29:26,429
Is that how you saw it?

584
00:29:27,469 --> 00:29:29,699
Well, Ms. Oh,

585
00:29:29,869 --> 00:29:32,199
can you make changes to the character's personality?

586
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:35,769
I think it's best that we see a revised version.

587
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:37,609
Are you okay with time, Ms. Oh?

588
00:29:39,609 --> 00:29:40,649
Ms. Oh?

589
00:29:41,810 --> 00:29:44,179
Revising is not a big deal.

590
00:29:44,350 --> 00:29:46,689
I don't think the direction is right.

591
00:29:47,189 --> 00:29:48,389
Being cool is good.

592
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:50,189
You'll feel a sense of vicarious satisfaction.

593
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:54,929
But this drama should be something that you can relate to.

594
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:58,600
The character's way of speech and actions...

595
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:00,270
are some things you can relate to.

596
00:30:01,699 --> 00:30:04,069
It's a proud feeling when the character makes...

597
00:30:04,070 --> 00:30:05,139
the right decision in the end.

598
00:30:06,369 --> 00:30:07,909
That's the drama people should watch.

599
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:14,550
Does that mean you can't make the revisions?

600
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:17,649
Then, you can't work with us.

601
00:30:19,449 --> 00:30:20,689
Ms. Oh.

602
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:22,889
You only need to make small changes.

603
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,490
She'll make the changes.

604
00:30:26,959 --> 00:30:28,858
I can make all the revisions you want.

605
00:30:28,859 --> 00:30:32,199
But this drama does not have a character like that.

606
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,969
Ms. Oh.

607
00:30:47,149 --> 00:30:48,280
I...

608
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:51,820
I'll do it.

609
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:53,989
- Excuse me? - Min Chae.

610
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:55,149
Well,

611
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:56,859
I have more faith in the script...

612
00:30:57,359 --> 00:30:58,760
now that I've met with Ms. Oh.

613
00:31:03,459 --> 00:31:04,560
Why don't we try this?

614
00:31:16,939 --> 00:31:19,179
- This is great. - Good work!

615
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:20,679
Ri Woo, look.

616
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:22,550
Say hello to Grandpa.

617
00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:24,519
Say hello. Try it.

618
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:27,350
Stop making the baby say things she can't and be quiet.

619
00:31:28,750 --> 00:31:31,759
I want to see Ri Woo's face and not yours.

620
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,888
Get her in the frame.

621
00:31:32,889 --> 00:31:35,590
I thought you turned into a hermit being in the mountains.

622
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:37,158
But you're still the same.

623
00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:39,969
That's why I don't want to be tangled up in the secular world.

624
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,169
Dad.

625
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,669
How long are you going to stay there?

626
00:31:44,699 --> 00:31:45,699
Aren't you coming back?

627
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:48,109
Why would I leave when everything good is here?

628
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,510
You...

629
00:31:50,510 --> 00:31:55,648
need to think of what really matters as you live your life.

630
00:31:55,649 --> 00:31:59,020
Of course, what else can I say?

631
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,468
Mom.

632
00:32:17,469 --> 00:32:18,699
Yes.

633
00:32:19,939 --> 00:32:21,070
That's what happened.

634
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:23,740
Mom! Congratulations!

635
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,439
Goodness.

636
00:32:26,179 --> 00:32:28,849
Woo Ri, how do you feel about having a younger sibling?

637
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:30,080
Well,

638
00:32:30,679 --> 00:32:33,050
my younger sibling is younger than my daughter.

639
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:35,849
That's true.

640
00:32:35,850 --> 00:32:39,090
Once a good thing happens, more good things are on the way.

641
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:41,559
I can't believe we have such good news...

642
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,629
the day before your wedding.

643
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,399
Thank you.

644
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:48,570
You should take good care of yourself now.

645
00:32:49,369 --> 00:32:51,039
But what do we do?

646
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,639
We open our fifth branch of Seo Gwi Nyeo's Pork Cutlet.

647
00:32:53,939 --> 00:32:55,039
Gosh.

648
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,480
Being a CEO of the franchise is great,

649
00:32:57,909 --> 00:33:00,879
but please be a good mother to our child as well.

650
00:33:01,010 --> 00:33:03,179
We just started picking up the momentum.

651
00:33:04,879 --> 00:33:06,019
Eun Ran,

652
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:08,849
why don't you sleep with me? You, too, Woo Ri.

653
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:10,060
I'd like that.

654
00:33:13,389 --> 00:33:14,760
Do you need anything?

655
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,699
No, goodnight.

656
00:33:17,659 --> 00:33:18,730
Okay.

657
00:33:20,469 --> 00:33:23,069
Can't I sleep with you over there?

658
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:24,639
- No. - No.

659
00:33:25,869 --> 00:33:26,939
Darn it.

660
00:33:28,869 --> 00:33:30,109
Goodnight everyone.

661
00:33:34,409 --> 00:33:36,780
I feel so lonely.

662
00:33:39,379 --> 00:33:41,020
This is our last night together.

663
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,389
I can come and sleep over from time to time.

664
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:49,060
But it'll be the last time before becoming a married woman.

665
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:51,959
That's true.

666
00:33:52,929 --> 00:33:54,969
We had you...

667
00:33:56,199 --> 00:33:57,869
and raised you here.

668
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,409
Now, we're sending you off like this.

669
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:02,769
No.

670
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:05,480
You can't say anything sentimental. Nothing that will make you cry.

671
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:09,550
I feel like I'm going to cry already.

672
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:12,178
Your eyes will swell if you cry.

673
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:13,520
You need to look pretty for your wedding.

674
00:34:14,049 --> 00:34:16,619
This won't work. Mom, let's sleep. Turn off the lights.

675
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,159
All right.

676
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:23,229
What's that? Why aren't the lights off in the living room?

677
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:25,029
Gosh, your dad.

678
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:28,369
- I'll go turn it off. - Stay put.

679
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:31,040
You're getting married, and I'm pregnant.

680
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,580
Do you feel better making your old mom do things for you?

681
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,110
All right.

682
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:09,499
Thank you.

683
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,940
Wait.

684
00:36:11,339 --> 00:36:12,699
Where's the groom?

685
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,270
He went to get the bouquet.

686
00:36:15,469 --> 00:36:17,138
Why would the groom pick that up?

687
00:36:17,139 --> 00:36:19,040
He says it's the last surprise event that he can do for her.

688
00:36:19,949 --> 00:36:21,908
There isn't anyone like Kang Jae.

689
00:36:21,909 --> 00:36:23,250
He's so devoted.

690
00:36:23,819 --> 00:36:25,319
That's all good...

691
00:36:26,279 --> 00:36:27,790
but he can't be late.

692
00:36:29,889 --> 00:36:31,589
Why isn't this thing answering?

693
00:36:32,319 --> 00:36:33,960
This is driving me crazy.

694
00:36:35,389 --> 00:36:36,529
Wait.

695
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:17,469
Yes. That's how you do it!

696
00:37:17,639 --> 00:37:18,839
Yes.

697
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,710
Right.

698
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:25,779
- Dad, hand me my clothes. - What?

699
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,850
- Here. - What's wrong?

700
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,250
I need to go get Kang Jae.

701
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:32,178
What? Where is he?

702
00:37:32,179 --> 00:37:33,448
He got arrested.

703
00:37:33,449 --> 00:37:35,689
What do you mean by that?

704
00:37:35,690 --> 00:37:36,859
Why would a detective get arrested?

705
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,218
I don't know. He smashed up a parking lot...

706
00:37:38,219 --> 00:37:39,420
trying to get here quickly.

707
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:41,690
I called a taxi, so I'll get him quickly.

708
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:43,229
But still.

709
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:44,960
You can't go. Someone else should.

710
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:46,428
You're the bride.

711
00:37:46,429 --> 00:37:48,869
What can I do? He's my husband. I should go.

712
00:37:49,940 --> 00:37:51,269
- I'll be back. - But still...

713
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:52,769
- Woo Ri. - Gosh.

714
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,170
Where are you rushing off to?

715
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:55,369
Are you going to the bathroom?

716
00:37:59,949 --> 00:38:02,179
Yes. I'm outside.

717
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:06,250
What? The road closed down? Why?

718
00:38:19,029 --> 00:38:20,130
Gosh.

719
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:36,920
(Love the Environment Marathon Race)

720
00:38:57,799 --> 00:38:58,999
(Taxi Cancelled)

721
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,610
What's this? This can't happen.

722
00:39:14,089 --> 00:39:15,089
Mr. Bus Driver!

723
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:16,420
Wait for me.

724
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,959
Does this bus go to Sangmun Police Station?

725
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:20,960
Yes.

726
00:39:20,961 --> 00:39:22,230
How long will it take to get there?

727
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:23,999
It'll take about an hour.

728
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,969
No, that can't be. I'll be late for my wedding.

729
00:39:27,429 --> 00:39:29,029
Can't you go straight to the police station?

730
00:39:29,170 --> 00:39:30,469
Of course not.

731
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:32,100
A bus isn't a taxi.

732
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,440
- Right. - Miss.

733
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,838
We're all busy. Stop slowing us down.

734
00:39:36,839 --> 00:39:38,779
Are you getting on or not?

735
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,149
Everyone,

736
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:43,850
I'm getting married in an hour.

737
00:39:43,949 --> 00:39:46,250
I had so many mishaps.

738
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:49,318
You wouldn't believe the things I went through to get to this point.

739
00:39:49,319 --> 00:39:50,588
So, what?

740
00:39:50,589 --> 00:39:51,718
We're all busy as well.

741
00:39:51,719 --> 00:39:53,389
- Exactly. - Gosh.

742
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:54,729
- I'm late. - Come on.

743
00:39:54,730 --> 00:39:56,559
- I need to go grocery shopping. - What's wrong with her.

744
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,730
I...

745
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,799
didn't believe in premarital intimacy...

746
00:39:59,929 --> 00:40:02,500
but got pregnant by accident through artificial insemination.

747
00:40:03,639 --> 00:40:04,900
What?

748
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:06,500
Pregnant?

749
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,739
Kang Jae!

750
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:13,249
Woo Ri!

751
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:14,949
Kang Jae, are you all right?

752
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:18,819
So your wedding is actually today? Why didn't you tell us?

753
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:22,589
Found you, my husband.

754
00:40:24,819 --> 00:40:26,519
- They're coming out. - Run!

755
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:28,630
- Hurry! - Over here!

756
00:40:34,730 --> 00:40:36,900
- This is my husband. - Hello.

757
00:40:39,909 --> 00:40:43,309
So? Is he the father of the baby?

758
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:44,879
Gosh, no.

759
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,479
No? Then what happened after that?

760
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,948
That's...

761
00:40:48,949 --> 00:40:50,319
Excuse me for a moment.

762
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:56,960
- Hi, Mom. - We're trapped here right now.

763
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:58,519
We can't even move the car. What do we do?

764
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,389
What? That's...

765
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:04,599
Everyone. You all want to know what happened after that, right?

766
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,968
- Yes! - Yes, tell us!

767
00:41:06,969 --> 00:41:08,029
Okay.

768
00:41:08,830 --> 00:41:10,839
Mom, we have to go that way.

769
00:41:11,069 --> 00:41:13,369
- We have to go. Hurry. - My goodness.

770
00:41:19,009 --> 00:41:20,479
Is something wrong?

771
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,049
Choi Seoung Il! My gosh, I'm a fan!

772
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:26,249
- I can't believe this! - Oh, you mean your mother is a fan?

773
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:28,548
No, me! I'm following you on social media.

774
00:41:28,549 --> 00:41:31,459
- I loved "Daddy Cop"! - My gosh!

775
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:34,759
I see that all my young fans are here.

776
00:41:35,489 --> 00:41:37,529
- Go, Choi Seoung Il! - Come on.

777
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,270
- You got this! - Go, Seoung Il!

778
00:41:45,969 --> 00:41:47,239
You made it.

779
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:49,979
I don't see the bride.

780
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:53,610
I know. She'll be a little... A tad late.

781
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:56,350
Even her wedding is so eventful.

782
00:41:57,049 --> 00:41:59,619
Go on in. The ceremony will begin soon.

783
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:04,159
Excuse me.

784
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,589
- Police. - Okay, what's the matter?

785
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:10,130
- What's with your hair? - There's nothing wrong with it.

786
00:42:10,299 --> 00:42:11,600
I'll have to check your ID.

787
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,730
- I don't have one on me... - Wait!

788
00:42:14,969 --> 00:42:16,170
Whereabouts are they?

789
00:42:16,429 --> 00:42:18,369
They're almost here.

790
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,909
- They're coming, right? - Yes, of course.

791
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:22,909
- All right. - See you inside.

792
00:42:24,279 --> 00:42:27,710
Why aren't they here yet? They really should be here by now.

793
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:29,810
Oh, hello.

794
00:42:30,279 --> 00:42:33,389
Please, you need to stop biting your nails.

795
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:35,650
Hi, sweetie.

796
00:42:40,089 --> 00:42:41,729
- Come on! - My goodness.

797
00:42:41,730 --> 00:42:44,330
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

798
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:46,830
Oh, boy. What is this mess?

799
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:49,068
Mom, it's here. It's that bus.

800
00:42:49,069 --> 00:42:51,238
- Hurry! - Hurry up!

801
00:42:51,239 --> 00:42:52,769
There they are.

802
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:54,940
- Mom, Grandma, Dad! - Grandma, hurry!

803
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,338
- What? My gosh. - Woo Ri!

804
00:42:57,339 --> 00:42:59,408
- Hurry, quick. - Come, this way!

805
00:42:59,409 --> 00:43:02,109
- What's going on? - How did you find this bus?

806
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:04,650
- Hurry. - Over here. Careful, Grandma.

807
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,889
- Hop on. Ladies first. - Be careful.

808
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:10,920
- What's going on? - How come they aren't here yet?

809
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:13,859
Hello, ladies and gentlemen.

810
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:17,459
The groom, bride, and her family...

811
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:19,830
are on their way here now.

812
00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:21,770
- They still haven't arrived yet? - They're on their way,

813
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,639
but they'll be a little late due to unforeseeable circumstances.

814
00:43:26,869 --> 00:43:29,770
- Goodness. - This is not good.

815
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:35,509
The bride was quick to get pregnant but is late to her own wedding.

816
00:43:45,659 --> 00:43:48,529
Well, please be patient and wait just a little longer.

817
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:55,830
Ri Woo, I hope you grow up to be an eloquent speaker.

818
00:43:57,270 --> 00:44:00,639
That's why I decided to marry this man right here.

819
00:44:02,069 --> 00:44:05,179
Oh, my. That's quite a love story.

820
00:44:05,409 --> 00:44:06,609
Congratulations on getting hitched.

821
00:44:06,610 --> 00:44:08,779
- Congratulations. - Thank you.

822
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:12,850
My gosh, your parents must be incredibly happy for you.

823
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:16,020
We are happy, but we're late for her wedding.

824
00:44:17,089 --> 00:44:19,589
We're here. We've arrived.

825
00:44:24,159 --> 00:44:26,298
- Careful. - Best of luck!

826
00:44:26,299 --> 00:44:29,169
- Good luck! - You got this!

827
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:30,939
- You got this! - We hope all goes well!

828
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:32,869
- Go! - You got this!

829
00:44:33,299 --> 00:44:36,509
- Go for it! - Best of luck!

830
00:44:37,009 --> 00:44:39,739
Let's go! Oh, boy.

831
00:44:40,279 --> 00:44:41,448
(The Wedding of Lee Kang Jae and Oh Woo Ri)

832
00:44:41,449 --> 00:44:43,618
- Hurry. We're here! - We're here!

833
00:44:43,619 --> 00:44:44,920
- Here! - We're here.

834
00:44:45,049 --> 00:44:46,819
The bride and groom are here too.

835
00:44:48,219 --> 00:44:50,388
Oh, nice. They're here.

836
00:44:50,389 --> 00:44:52,359
- You made it! - Congratulations.

837
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:53,729
- They're here at last. - Oh, my.

838
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:54,860
Ladies and gentlemen.

839
00:44:55,159 --> 00:44:58,000
They're a little late, but they didn't take too long.

840
00:44:58,360 --> 00:45:02,869
Let us begin the ceremony we've all been waiting for.

841
00:45:06,199 --> 00:45:08,638
- The groom! - Looking handsome!

842
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:10,279
- Oh, my. - Congratulations!

843
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:13,679
- He's one good-looking groom! - You look dashing!

844
00:45:45,739 --> 00:45:48,809
- Congratulations! - The bride looks stunning!

845
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:50,449
- Oh, my! - Woo Ri!

846
00:45:57,089 --> 00:45:58,119
What a beautiful bride!

847
00:47:57,380 --> 00:47:58,610
Ri Woo.

848
00:47:59,810 --> 00:48:01,449
Your mom looks so beautiful today.

849
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:06,880
I've never seen her looking so stunning.

850
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:34,278
I'll take Ri Woo so you can eat comfortably.

851
00:48:34,279 --> 00:48:36,049
No, it's okay.

852
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:39,150
She was with her mom for ten months. I still have a long way to go.

853
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:42,520
Anyway, I have to say I really love having dinner with you here.

854
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:45,089
It's always been my dream since I was little.

855
00:48:45,319 --> 00:48:47,230
Having dinner with the entire family.

856
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:50,330
You can come and have dinner with us anytime, Ri Woo's daddy.

857
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:53,799
Mother, you call him "Ri Woo's daddy" now.

858
00:48:54,299 --> 00:48:55,830
I call him Raphael.

859
00:48:56,830 --> 00:48:59,239
I mean, we can't call him our son-in-law.

860
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:02,569
It's complicated, isn't it?

861
00:49:03,409 --> 00:49:04,779
I think of him as my grandson...

862
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:07,509
because he's the father of my great-granddaughter.

863
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:11,619
Then it gets even more complicated because that makes him my son.

864
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:13,420
Son?

865
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:17,520
I like that. Son.

866
00:49:21,759 --> 00:49:22,860
Father.

867
00:49:24,529 --> 00:49:25,560
Mother.

868
00:49:27,029 --> 00:49:28,069
Grandma.

869
00:49:29,529 --> 00:49:32,040
- So I have a son now? - Yes, you do.

870
00:49:34,409 --> 00:49:37,540
Okay. As of today, we are...

871
00:50:01,929 --> 00:50:05,170
Hello, we have a reservation under Lee Kang Jae.

872
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:07,369
Just a moment, please.

873
00:50:35,270 --> 00:50:36,369
Well...

874
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:39,900
Should we turn off the lights?

875
00:50:40,369 --> 00:50:41,940
Oh, right.

876
00:50:42,339 --> 00:50:44,839
- Yes, shall we? - Okay.

877
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:55,150
Wait, Woo Ri. Hold on.

878
00:50:55,719 --> 00:50:57,150
- What? - What is this?

879
00:50:57,489 --> 00:50:59,420
- Oh, wait. - I'm sorry.

880
00:50:59,659 --> 00:51:01,659
- Hold on. - My gosh, hang on.

881
00:51:08,130 --> 00:51:10,299
Yes. Hi, Raphael.

882
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:11,699
Woo Ri.

883
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:17,310
I kept debating whether or not to call you.

884
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:19,980
Okay, what's the matter?

885
00:51:20,139 --> 00:51:22,810
I know you got married today and that you're at the hotel now,

886
00:51:24,179 --> 00:51:25,880
so I wasn't sure whether I should tell you this.

887
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:28,020
I was really torn.

888
00:51:28,389 --> 00:51:30,420
Okay. What's the matter?

889
00:51:33,489 --> 00:51:37,500
I just thought I'd regret it a lot if I didn't tell you.

890
00:51:37,630 --> 00:51:40,230
What's going on? What is it that you need to tell me?

891
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,500
Well...

892
00:51:42,069 --> 00:51:43,330
Woo Ri.

893
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:44,900
Yes, go ahead.

894
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:49,770
Ri Woo is very sick.

895
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:55,179
- What? - Where are they?

896
00:52:02,819 --> 00:52:04,389
Ri Woo!

897
00:52:05,020 --> 00:52:06,319
Ri Woo, are you all right?

898
00:52:07,790 --> 00:52:09,159
What's wrong with her?

899
00:52:09,259 --> 00:52:10,630
She's short of breath with a high fever.

900
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:13,230
Thank goodness her father brought her here early enough.

901
00:52:13,429 --> 00:52:16,170
We just have to run some tests, so don't worry.

902
00:52:16,529 --> 00:52:17,969
Please bring her to the treatment room.

903
00:52:20,500 --> 00:52:22,209
Gosh, my baby.

904
00:52:22,210 --> 00:52:23,909
Mommy is here.

905
00:52:25,679 --> 00:52:26,880
Hey, Kang Jae.

906
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:28,679
I'm really sorry.

907
00:52:30,719 --> 00:52:32,049
No, I'm glad you called us.

908
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:35,489
(Emergency Treatment Room)

909
00:52:43,929 --> 00:52:45,000
Is she asleep?

910
00:52:45,659 --> 00:52:46,900
She's fast asleep now.

911
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:56,969
She really looks like an angel when she's asleep.

912
00:52:58,139 --> 00:52:59,839
She looks like an angel even when she's awake.

913
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:01,850
That's true.

914
00:53:05,219 --> 00:53:06,380
Woo Ri.

915
00:53:07,819 --> 00:53:09,020
I'm really sorry.

916
00:53:09,489 --> 00:53:13,219
I thought long and hard about whether or not to call you.

917
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:16,029
No, I'm so glad you called me.

918
00:53:16,690 --> 00:53:19,159
If I didn't find out until tomorrow...

919
00:53:19,699 --> 00:53:21,130
I don't even want to think about it.

920
00:53:21,469 --> 00:53:22,869
Thank you for calling me.

921
00:53:23,830 --> 00:53:26,969
We promised we wouldn't keep secrets when it comes to Ri Woo.

922
00:53:28,969 --> 00:53:30,170
That's right.

923
00:53:30,310 --> 00:53:33,880
Let's share everything, good and bad.

924
00:53:36,850 --> 00:53:38,619
We recently had Ri Woo's 100th-day celebration.

925
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:41,749
The 100th day after a child's birth...

926
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:44,089
is exactly a year after the child's conception.

927
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:46,659
I must say,

928
00:53:47,759 --> 00:53:49,960
so many things have happened to us in the past year.

929
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:52,799
I know.

930
00:53:53,199 --> 00:53:55,830
It feels like only yesterday that I found out I was pregnant with her.

931
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,900
I can't believe it's already been a year.

932
00:54:30,799 --> 00:54:32,739
I called her "Gummy Bear".

933
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:37,040
The day I first met Ri Woo still feels like a dream.

934
00:55:31,299 --> 00:55:32,560
The two of us...

935
00:55:33,429 --> 00:55:35,429
managed to make this work.

936
00:55:41,639 --> 00:55:44,239
And I'm glad I could do it with you.

937
00:55:47,279 --> 00:55:50,380
Continue to help me out a lot, Ri Woo's mom.

938
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:55,589
Help me out too, Ri Woo's dad.

939
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:14,869
Thank goodness Ri Woo is okay now.

940
00:56:15,739 --> 00:56:17,409
Right, my daughter.

941
00:56:24,049 --> 00:56:26,119
You seem a little more at ease now.

942
00:56:27,889 --> 00:56:29,850
It must've been so stressful, honey.

943
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:31,920
Thanks, Kang Jae.

944
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:34,290
- And I'm sorry. - What?

945
00:56:35,830 --> 00:56:37,659
Nothing's easy in my books.

946
00:56:38,529 --> 00:56:39,559
What do you mean?

947
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:41,000
You know what I mean.

948
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:42,900
I was late for my own wedding,

949
00:56:43,069 --> 00:56:44,569
and our first night together was an epic fail.

950
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:47,000
An epic fail?

951
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:49,310
It did fail.

952
00:56:50,139 --> 00:56:52,309
To tell you the truth, I was more excited about that...

953
00:56:52,310 --> 00:56:54,310
than the wedding ceremony.

954
00:56:57,250 --> 00:56:58,350
Woo Ri.

955
00:56:59,150 --> 00:57:00,219
Yes?

956
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:02,190
We did not fail.

957
00:57:05,190 --> 00:57:06,520
I said, we didn't fail!

958
00:57:07,659 --> 00:57:08,790
Woo Ri!

959
00:57:09,790 --> 00:57:11,600
Failure is the path to success!

960
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:44,489
Oh, I'm suddenly curious about something.

961
00:58:45,190 --> 00:58:46,920
What? What is it?

962
00:58:49,159 --> 00:58:50,759
What was the title of your drama again?

963
00:58:52,759 --> 00:58:54,029
"From Today, We Are".

964
00:58:55,770 --> 00:58:58,000
Does it have a happy ending?

965
00:59:00,239 --> 00:59:01,670
Not sure. Why do you ask?

966
00:59:04,639 --> 00:59:06,310
Because we did.

967
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:09,480
I'm so happy right now.

968
00:59:10,110 --> 00:59:13,380
Will it make the viewers as happy as I am?

969
00:59:17,150 --> 00:59:18,460
We shall see.
