I had always wanted to ask Mom since I was little,

124

127

decide to keep me?

128

00:10:20,115 --> 00:10:22,445

Ma Ri.

Ma Ri!

151
00:10:32,794 --> 00:10:35,424
This must've been exhausting for you.

152
00:10:36,565 --> 00:10:40,095
All your desperate antics must've taken a lot out of you.

153

It's really over now.

154
00:10:44,735 --> 00:10:45,804
We're done.

155
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:58,355
I only have one chance to make a baby.

156
00:11:01,085 --> 00:11:03,154
And thinking about that...

157
00:11:05,355 --> 00:11:08,894
made me feel like there could be someone out there...

159

160
00:11:29,745 --> 00:11:31,684
Someone else is.

163
00:11:40,394 --> 00:11:41,725
That's nuts.

164
00:11:43,065 --> 00:11:45,334
Mom, it's all over now.

165
00:11:45,335 --> 00:11:46,864
No, it's not!

166
00:11:46,865 --> 00:11:49,065
We can't let our three years' worth of work go down the drain.

167

We'll find a way.

170
00:11:56,845 --> 00:11:59,074
You're always so pessimistic. You see, that's your problem.

171
00:11:59,075 --> 00:12:03,784
I told you to be more positive about everything.

172
00:12:06,384 --> 00:12:08,454
Mom, I'm exhausted.

173
00:12:08,455 --> 00:12:09,554
Oh, my sweetheart.

174
00:12:10,355 --> 00:12:13,554
Are you tired of doing all the work now?

175
00:12:14,394 --> 00:12:17,224
Then let the bear do all the work...

176
00:12:17,225 --> 00:12:20,434
so we can just sit back and enjoy the show.

177
00:12:22,105 --> 00:12:23,164
What?

178
00:12:24,164 --> 00:12:28,004
Remember, the power of positive thinking. "I can do it."

179
00:12:28,245 --> 00:12:29,705
"I got this."

180
00:12:33,014 --> 00:12:34,815
- Who is it? - My gosh! Who?

181
00:12:35,115 --> 00:12:37,715
That woman. The one who's pregnant!

182
00:12:37,884 --> 00:12:39,314
Why do you ask?

183
00:12:39,315 --> 00:12:41,485
I cannot disclose patient information.

184
00:12:42,154 --> 00:12:45,224
You have a red pill and a blue pill in front of you.

185
00:12:45,225 --> 00:12:46,994
- Which one will you take? - Sorry?

186
00:12:46,995 --> 00:12:48,564
If you take the red one,

187
00:12:48,565 --> 00:12:50,263
you'll have to share a tiny cell...

188
00:12:50,264 --> 00:12:52,133
and even a toilet with eight cellmates.

189
00:12:52,134 --> 00:12:53,565
If you choose the blue one,

190
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:56,065
you can continue working as a doctor.

191
00:12:56,164 --> 00:12:58,674
The blue one. I'll take the blue pill.

192
00:12:58,904 --> 00:13:00,304
I just need her to give birth to the baby.

193
00:13:00,504 --> 00:13:03,674
I just need that woman to deliver the baby safe and sound!

194
00:13:04,345 --> 00:13:05,445
One moment, please.

195
00:13:08,784 --> 00:13:09,845
Here.

196
00:13:12,054 --> 00:13:13,284
(Name: Oh Woo Ri)

197
00:13:13,455 --> 00:13:15,554
"Oh Woo Ri"?

198
00:13:16,554 --> 00:13:18,523
Gosh, the name rings a bell.

199
00:13:18,524 --> 00:13:22,125
She's coming in today for an abortion.

200
00:13:22,524 --> 00:13:23,894
No way!

201
00:13:25,164 --> 00:13:27,064
- My gosh. - Reschedule it.

202
00:13:27,065 --> 00:13:29,164
- Okay. - Try to buy some time.

203
00:13:29,365 --> 00:13:30,634
Yes, ma'am.

204
00:13:36,205 --> 00:13:39,413
Hey, what's wrong?

205
00:13:39,414 --> 00:13:41,544
Didn't you see a doctor? Are you not feeling well?

206
00:13:42,815 --> 00:13:45,384
- I'm okay. - You don't look okay.

207
00:13:46,154 --> 00:13:47,355
What's wrong? Tell me.

208
00:13:48,524 --> 00:13:49,725
Ms. Yu.

209
00:13:51,995 --> 00:13:53,254
Ye Ri.

210
00:13:53,924 --> 00:13:54,924
What is it?

211
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:57,995
Nowadays,

212
00:13:59,264 --> 00:14:01,134
abortions are legal, right?

213
00:14:01,804 --> 00:14:03,104
What are you talking about?

214
00:14:03,105 --> 00:14:06,205
If you get pregnant due to an artificial insemination mix-up...

215
00:14:07,575 --> 00:14:08,644
You...

216
00:14:09,774 --> 00:14:11,075
You're...

217
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:14,815
finally beginning to understand the charm of bad soap operas.

218
00:14:15,115 --> 00:14:16,684
I like that story!

219
00:14:17,884 --> 00:14:18,884
Thanks.

220
00:14:19,754 --> 00:14:22,783
It wouldn't be a sin to get an abortion in that case, right?

221
00:14:22,784 --> 00:14:25,253
An abortion... No, let's not do that.

222
00:14:25,254 --> 00:14:27,325
How about... Two million dollars?

223
00:14:27,394 --> 00:14:31,095
If a rich family asks her to keep the baby for two million dollars,

224
00:14:31,164 --> 00:14:32,734
then you have a classic story.

225
00:14:32,735 --> 00:14:36,965
The thing is, no one would actually offer that much money.

226
00:14:37,105 --> 00:14:38,933
Both the mother and the baby would have a hard time.

227
00:14:38,934 --> 00:14:41,273
Hey, she can just give the baby to that family,

228
00:14:41,274 --> 00:14:44,075
get the two million dollars, and turn her life around!

229
00:14:44,674 --> 00:14:45,715
However,

230
00:14:46,075 --> 00:14:48,884
it'll turn into a tragedy because of the maternal bond.

231
00:14:49,445 --> 00:14:51,985
"I am your birth mother."

232
00:14:52,955 --> 00:14:55,254
Come on. That's too old-fashioned.

233
00:14:55,585 --> 00:14:57,585
What? You're the one who started this.

234
00:14:58,955 --> 00:14:59,995
Come in.

235
00:15:00,254 --> 00:15:01,725
Hello, Director.

236
00:15:02,095 --> 00:15:04,865
Ms. Yu, Seoung Il wanted to talk to you about something,

237
00:15:05,335 --> 00:15:08,065
- in person. - Yes. Sit down.

238
00:15:08,735 --> 00:15:09,865
You too, sit down.

239
00:15:11,134 --> 00:15:12,875
Well, Ms. Yu.

240
00:15:14,235 --> 00:15:16,244
In the 28th and 29th episodes,

241
00:15:16,245 --> 00:15:19,245
Chun Sa Da shows no emotion.

242
00:15:19,345 --> 00:15:22,084
He's not human. He's like a robot.

243
00:15:22,085 --> 00:15:24,085
A robot, I see.

244
00:15:24,414 --> 00:15:26,553
But last time, you mentioned...

245
00:15:26,554 --> 00:15:30,523
that you wanted to protect Ji Dok Sa like Daddy-Long-Legs would.

246
00:15:30,524 --> 00:15:32,694
That's why I wrote those two episodes like that.

247
00:15:32,695 --> 00:15:34,024
He's like a sunflower.

248
00:15:34,394 --> 00:15:36,825
A sunflower isn't human. It's a plant.

249
00:15:37,024 --> 00:15:39,495
I see, it's a plant.

250
00:15:40,034 --> 00:15:43,433
Ms. Yu is already planning to include some scenes...

251
00:15:43,434 --> 00:15:46,105
where Chun Sa Da is taking action starting with the 30th episode.

252
00:15:46,804 --> 00:15:49,904
Chun Sa Da shouldn't stand out just yet.

253
00:15:53,575 --> 00:15:54,714
Who is she?

254
00:15:54,715 --> 00:15:56,585
Oh, she is Ms. Yu's assistant.

255
00:15:56,845 --> 00:15:58,614
Woo Ri, haven't you introduced yourself yet?

256
00:15:58,615 --> 00:16:00,715
I say hello to him every time I see him.

257
00:16:01,455 --> 00:16:04,724
These days, I guess it's okay for a mere assistant writer...

258
00:16:04,725 --> 00:16:07,825
to cut me off during an important meeting like this.

259
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:10,725
Is this the latest trend or something?

260
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:12,763
My apologies. I'm sorry.

261
00:16:12,764 --> 00:16:15,364
The script for the 30th episode will be out tomorrow.

262
00:16:15,365 --> 00:16:16,734
Go over it, and we can discuss this again.

263
00:16:16,735 --> 00:16:18,064
- Really? - Yes, just do that.

264
00:16:18,065 --> 00:16:19,974
Your character's doing great,

265
00:16:19,975 --> 00:16:21,734
and the story will revolve around you.

266
00:16:21,735 --> 00:16:23,745
You can't be in the spotlight every day, you know.

267
00:16:24,804 --> 00:16:27,013
I'm not bringing this up because I want to stand out.

268
00:16:27,014 --> 00:16:28,913
If the characters are not consistent,

269
00:16:28,914 --> 00:16:30,884
the viewers will react right away.

270
00:16:31,315 --> 00:16:32,455
In an instant!

271
00:16:32,855 --> 00:16:35,784
I swear, I'm bringing this up for the sake of the drama.

272
00:16:35,884 --> 00:16:36,984
Of course.

273
00:16:36,985 --> 00:16:39,725
Thanks to you, the drama has been getting good feedback.

274
00:16:39,825 --> 00:16:43,523
All thanks to your concern and hard work. Thank you.

275
00:16:43,524 --> 00:16:46,034
- Seoung Il, you're the best. - I know.

276
00:16:46,764 --> 00:16:47,794
Hello?

277
00:16:49,065 --> 00:16:51,204
You found the address? Where?

278
00:16:51,205 --> 00:16:52,774
Wait, hold on.

279
00:16:53,934 --> 00:16:56,273
Something's come up. I have to go.

280
00:16:56,274 --> 00:16:58,643
And let's keep our spirits up.

281
00:16:58,644 --> 00:17:00,673
This drama has to do well, you know?

282
00:17:00,674 --> 00:17:01,815
Let's do our very best.

283
00:17:02,745 --> 00:17:04,215
- You can do it! - Thank you.

284
00:17:05,985 --> 00:17:08,755
You're feisty. Real feisty.

285
00:17:09,484 --> 00:17:11,994
- Have a good day. - My goodness.

286
00:17:12,894 --> 00:17:15,464
Hello? Where?

287
00:17:22,634 --> 00:17:23,805
My goodness.

288
00:17:24,164 --> 00:17:26,005
Who is it, this time?

289
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:30,743
One bottle of this sells every second...

290
00:17:30,744 --> 00:17:32,473
where I used to live.

291
00:17:32,474 --> 00:17:34,444
It's the most famous vitamin supplement in Sweden.

292
00:17:35,515 --> 00:17:37,314
You should take better care of your health.

293
00:17:37,315 --> 00:17:39,714
I got it just for you.

294
00:17:40,654 --> 00:17:41,884
Thank you.

295
00:17:43,454 --> 00:17:46,994
I was going to stop by the hospital for the marketing meeting.

296
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:50,595
Oh, this isn't about the drama.

297
00:17:52,634 --> 00:17:55,035
You go to Rosy OB-GYN Clinic, don't you?

298
00:17:55,535 --> 00:17:56,605
How did you know?

299
00:17:57,305 --> 00:17:58,434
The thing is,

300
00:17:59,704 --> 00:18:03,105
I was supposed to be injected with the sperm they gave you.

301
00:18:04,105 --> 00:18:05,173
Sorry?

302
00:18:05,174 --> 00:18:07,374
My husband and I had been preparing for artificial insemination,

303
00:18:07,375 --> 00:18:09,684
but they made the mistake of giving it to you.

304
00:18:10,045 --> 00:18:11,115
What...

305
00:18:13,184 --> 00:18:14,755
But how...

306
00:18:17,255 --> 00:18:18,954
How did you know that I was the one who got it?

307
00:18:20,055 --> 00:18:22,693
By pure chance... I happened to see the chart...

308
00:18:22,694 --> 00:18:24,264
and realized it was someone I knew.

309
00:18:24,265 --> 00:18:27,594
Since I know you, I can't just pretend not to know about it.

310
00:18:27,595 --> 00:18:28,765
So here I am.

311
00:18:30,105 --> 00:18:31,234
I...

312
00:18:33,434 --> 00:18:34,974
I'll just pretend it never happened.

313
00:18:39,845 --> 00:18:43,184
You see, my husband and I are in a bit of a bind.

314
00:18:44,285 --> 00:18:46,654
My husband had stomach cancer.

315
00:18:46,815 --> 00:18:49,883
He froze his sperm before he began his chemotherapy.

316
00:18:49,884 --> 00:18:51,525
Luckily, he's recovered now,

317
00:18:51,884 --> 00:18:54,755
but the sperm you got was the very last one.

318
00:18:56,664 --> 00:18:59,765
You've met my husband. Raphael.

319
00:19:01,865 --> 00:19:03,934
CEO Raphael?

320
00:19:04,605 --> 00:19:06,173
He's your husband?

321
00:19:06,174 --> 00:19:07,634
We will...

322
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:10,845
never conceive a child.

323
00:19:13,545 --> 00:19:15,115
Please help us.

324
00:19:15,345 --> 00:19:18,314
Gosh, what could I do...

325
00:19:18,315 --> 00:19:19,515
Our baby.

326
00:19:20,414 --> 00:19:22,085
Could you please keep the baby?

327
00:19:23,154 --> 00:19:24,855
Will you kill our baby?

328
00:19:25,654 --> 00:19:27,255
That was his last sperm.

329
00:19:28,454 --> 00:19:30,325
What am I supposed to do?

330
00:19:36,565 --> 00:19:38,134
What am I supposed to do?

331
00:19:40,505 --> 00:19:41,535
Sorry?

332
00:19:43,605 --> 00:19:45,375
What about my life?

333
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:05,694
(General Waste)

334
00:20:14,775 --> 00:20:16,045
Hello...

335
00:20:39,694 --> 00:20:40,994
I thought...

336
00:20:43,505 --> 00:20:45,164
it was something that only existed in movies.

337
00:20:47,075 --> 00:20:48,075
What?

338
00:20:48,275 --> 00:20:50,045
You know, private detectives who track down people.

339
00:20:52,115 --> 00:20:53,845
- Why are you here? - What about you?

340
00:20:54,575 --> 00:20:55,884
Why did you come to see me?

341
00:20:57,684 --> 00:20:59,354
I just happened to be there.

342
00:20:59,355 --> 00:21:00,984
Then why did you suddenly leave me back then?

343
00:21:01,454 --> 00:21:02,884
I couldn't reach you. Why did you do that?

344
00:21:05,285 --> 00:21:06,624
It's been so long that I don't even remember.

345
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:07,653
You shouldn't have come...

346
00:21:07,654 --> 00:21:08,963
if you were going to leave like that.

347
00:21:08,964 --> 00:21:10,224
It's been thirty years...

348
00:21:14,365 --> 00:21:15,464
Why did you show up?

349
00:21:22,204 --> 00:21:23,375
Duk Chil...

350
00:21:24,404 --> 00:21:25,815
It's you, isn't it?

351
00:21:26,615 --> 00:21:27,713
Mom.

352
00:21:27,714 --> 00:21:28,914
It's you, isn't it?

353
00:21:29,144 --> 00:21:30,514
You're Choi Seoung Il, right?

354
00:21:30,515 --> 00:21:31,644
Yes, hello.

355
00:21:33,484 --> 00:21:34,585
She must be your mother.

356
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:37,724
It's you. It's Choi Seoung Il.

357
00:21:38,484 --> 00:21:40,554
I'm such a fan.

358
00:21:40,555 --> 00:21:42,193
I watch all your dramas.

359
00:21:42,194 --> 00:21:44,125
I've watched them all. My goodness.

360
00:21:44,194 --> 00:21:45,364
Thank you.

361
00:21:45,365 --> 00:21:47,095
Thanks to fans like you,

362
00:21:47,394 --> 00:21:49,805
I'm able to do what I do.

363
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:53,204
By the way, what are you doing here?

364
00:21:54,404 --> 00:21:55,605
Well...

365
00:21:55,904 --> 00:21:57,243
He's here for the pork cutlet.

366
00:21:57,244 --> 00:21:58,404
- Yes. - Is that so?

367
00:21:58,914 --> 00:22:01,473
My pork cutlets are famous here.

368
00:22:01,474 --> 00:22:02,913
It's the soul food of Bukgajwa-dong.

369
00:22:02,914 --> 00:22:04,584
They try it in their childhood...

370
00:22:04,585 --> 00:22:06,384
and come back for it when they grow up.

371
00:22:06,515 --> 00:22:08,154
I'll go make some for you.

372
00:22:13,355 --> 00:22:14,625
Are you done?

373
00:22:15,154 --> 00:22:16,224
Yes.

374
00:22:19,095 --> 00:22:20,634
No Man Chul filed a complaint.

375
00:22:20,694 --> 00:22:22,034
I was called in for it.

376
00:22:22,035 --> 00:22:23,035
What are you going to do about it now?

377
00:22:23,565 --> 00:22:25,164
He ran away all of a sudden.

378
00:22:25,234 --> 00:22:27,034
You are always calm when you're working.

379
00:22:27,035 --> 00:22:29,704
But why do you turn all crazy when it comes to Chairman Kim?

380
00:22:30,045 --> 00:22:31,403
Did you think if No Man Chul got to Chairman Kim...

381
00:22:31,404 --> 00:22:33,814
he'd just hand you Chairman Kim on a silver platter?

382
00:22:33,815 --> 00:22:34,815
He'd run away.

383
00:22:35,515 --> 00:22:37,484
Na Hee, you remind us who Chairman Kim is.

384
00:22:39,855 --> 00:22:43,055
He exclusively supplied ecstasy known as "Sugar".

385
00:22:43,454 --> 00:22:45,084
No one's actually seen him,

386
00:22:45,085 --> 00:22:46,724
so he's known as the Faceless Drug King.

387
00:22:46,855 --> 00:22:49,064
He killed the only officer who saw him...

388
00:22:49,065 --> 00:22:50,325
and hasn't shown for two years.

389
00:22:52,934 --> 00:22:55,933
Sergeant Kim Jun Hyuk, who was Kang Jae's partner,

390
00:22:55,934 --> 00:22:58,265
died in the line of duty while chasing Chairman Kim.

391
00:22:58,605 --> 00:23:01,704
I also wake up in the middle of the night thinking of Jun Hyuk.

392
00:23:02,305 --> 00:23:04,275
It upsets me too, you know.

393
00:23:04,644 --> 00:23:07,015
Yes, we need to catch Chairman Kim.

394
00:23:07,075 --> 00:23:08,714
But don't move a muscle before you have hard evidence.

395
00:23:08,984 --> 00:23:11,684
You won't catch him with that attitude. Do you understand?

396
00:23:14,315 --> 00:23:16,484
Don't you go anywhere near No Man Chul.

397
00:23:17,654 --> 00:23:19,694
Then, I'll get going now.

398
00:23:27,595 --> 00:23:28,964
Can you really trust that one?

399
00:23:29,234 --> 00:23:30,835
Why would the police react like that for no reason?

400
00:23:31,404 --> 00:23:34,104
I looked into it, and there is no problem.

401
00:23:34,105 --> 00:23:35,875
So why do a cosmetics event?

402
00:23:36,075 --> 00:23:38,504
It's just the start. So, please, just wait and watch.

403
00:23:38,505 --> 00:23:40,743
Hey. Didn't I tell you I'll start a hospital...

404
00:23:40,744 --> 00:23:42,545
in China in three years?

405
00:23:42,884 --> 00:23:44,845
China has a population of 1.4 billion.

406
00:23:45,244 --> 00:23:46,484
How much is that compared to Korea?

407
00:23:46,615 --> 00:23:48,054
If you just divide 50 million,

408
00:23:48,055 --> 00:23:50,423
I could have that enormous amount of people...

409
00:23:50,424 --> 00:23:51,755
get the double eyelid surgery...

410
00:23:51,884 --> 00:23:53,325
and nose jobs.

411
00:23:54,255 --> 00:23:57,265
So, I need you to focus on the hospital work from now on.

412
00:23:57,365 --> 00:23:59,233
Plastic surgery is our leading product.

413
00:23:59,234 --> 00:24:00,765
You can just tie in the cosmetics.

414
00:24:03,265 --> 00:24:04,404
Gosh, my blood pressure.

415
00:24:06,734 --> 00:24:07,934
Get out all of you.

416
00:24:12,875 --> 00:24:14,174
Father.

417
00:24:14,345 --> 00:24:16,184
What is it Ma Ri?

418
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:19,984
Actually, I have something to discuss with you.

419
00:24:20,585 --> 00:24:21,714
Let's go.

420
00:24:22,015 --> 00:24:24,125
Father...

421
00:24:30,424 --> 00:24:31,694
What were you thinking?

422
00:24:33,335 --> 00:24:36,434
Are you going to make a big deal out of your mishap by blurting it out?

423
00:24:36,734 --> 00:24:37,805
Well...

424
00:24:38,335 --> 00:24:39,875
Father should know about it as well.

425
00:24:40,875 --> 00:24:42,775
Although I didn't get pregnant,

426
00:24:43,075 --> 00:24:44,744
we have your baby.

427
00:24:45,444 --> 00:24:47,075
I met with the woman who got pregnant.

428
00:24:47,875 --> 00:24:49,085
Are you crazy?

429
00:24:49,444 --> 00:24:50,944
Why would you meet with her?

430
00:24:50,984 --> 00:24:52,354
Because it's our child.

431
00:24:52,355 --> 00:24:53,854
What do you mean?

432
00:24:53,855 --> 00:24:55,855
That was a medical mishap. There is no child of ours.

433
00:24:56,224 --> 00:24:57,524
Honey.

434
00:24:57,525 --> 00:25:00,295
In Sweden or Northern Europe where I lived, surrogate mothers...

435
00:25:00,424 --> 00:25:01,755
- My gosh... - It's quite normal.

436
00:25:03,994 --> 00:25:05,365
Are we in Northern Europe?

437
00:25:05,664 --> 00:25:07,164
Is this Sweden?

438
00:25:08,095 --> 00:25:09,703
This is Korea.

439
00:25:09,704 --> 00:25:12,673
How can you ask a complete stranger to bear our child?

440
00:25:12,674 --> 00:25:14,335
She's not a stranger.

441
00:25:15,505 --> 00:25:16,844
What?

442
00:25:16,845 --> 00:25:18,605
We both know her.

443
00:25:21,375 --> 00:25:22,444
Who is it?

444
00:25:23,244 --> 00:25:24,785
Attention, please.

445
00:25:24,914 --> 00:25:28,285
We ask for your cooperation as we inform you of the visitations.

446
00:25:28,454 --> 00:25:31,954
For patient safety and prevention of external infections,

447
00:25:32,055 --> 00:25:35,224
we are limiting visitation hours...

448
00:25:45,934 --> 00:25:48,375
Why do you need the courage to say something you want?

449
00:25:49,404 --> 00:25:51,805
How can you achieve your dream if you can't say what it is?

450
00:25:52,914 --> 00:25:54,144
Say it to me.

451
00:25:55,444 --> 00:25:57,914
My dream is to become a drama screenwriter.

452
00:25:59,615 --> 00:26:01,555
My dream is to become a drama screenwriter.

453
00:26:01,755 --> 00:26:04,525
That's it. You should say it aloud so it comes true.

454
00:26:06,055 --> 00:26:07,255
Say it again.

455
00:26:07,295 --> 00:26:08,555
My dream is to become...

456
00:26:09,365 --> 00:26:10,625
a drama screenwriter.

457
00:26:13,765 --> 00:26:16,234
My dream is to become a drama screenwriter!

458
00:26:16,964 --> 00:26:19,575
Writer Oh Woo Ri!

459
00:26:20,674 --> 00:26:21,875
Yes!

460
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:52,605
But I still want you to find out patients' inconveniences...

461
00:26:53,105 --> 00:26:54,304
Then, keep up the hard work.

462
00:26:54,305 --> 00:26:55,434
Yes, sir.

463
00:27:13,194 --> 00:27:15,494
After I heard you went through all that,

464
00:27:16,424 --> 00:27:17,694
I was shocked.

465
00:27:18,464 --> 00:27:20,694
I also heard that the marketing team leader came to see you.

466
00:27:21,734 --> 00:27:26,434
So I was pondering whether to go and apologize to you.

467
00:27:28,674 --> 00:27:31,545
But I thought it was right that no one bothered you.

468
00:27:33,115 --> 00:27:34,914
I will make sure no one bothers you from now on.

469
00:27:35,744 --> 00:27:36,914
I'm sorry.

470
00:27:40,815 --> 00:27:42,184
What about you?

471
00:27:45,125 --> 00:27:46,255
Me?

472
00:27:46,855 --> 00:27:49,625
I heard you could no longer have children.

473
00:27:50,664 --> 00:27:52,734
Your wife sounded desperate.

474
00:27:53,535 --> 00:27:56,964
I'm curious about your thoughts.

475
00:28:01,275 --> 00:28:02,434
Well...

476
00:28:03,605 --> 00:28:05,875
Being given a chance to live again...

477
00:28:06,414 --> 00:28:07,815
after realizing I could die,

478
00:28:09,545 --> 00:28:11,213
the first thing that came to mind...

479
00:28:11,214 --> 00:28:13,714
was that I wanted to start my own family.

480
00:28:15,214 --> 00:28:16,355
Yes.

481
00:28:16,555 --> 00:28:19,025
I really want a child.

482
00:28:20,055 --> 00:28:21,394
But this isn't the right way.

483
00:28:23,765 --> 00:28:26,194
You should only think of yourself, Ms. Oh.

484
00:28:26,535 --> 00:28:28,065
Pretend you haven't heard about our problems.

485
00:28:29,535 --> 00:28:30,734
It was an accident.

486
00:28:31,535 --> 00:28:33,204
I know you're going through a lot because of the accident,

487
00:28:33,434 --> 00:28:36,444
so I'll do anything to help you fix this.

488
00:28:42,815 --> 00:28:44,413
I had the baby back then.

489
00:28:44,414 --> 00:28:46,814
- I thought you had an abortion. - It's a long story to tell.

490
00:28:46,815 --> 00:28:48,784
You said you had an abortion.

491
00:28:48,785 --> 00:28:50,383
You wanted to end the relationship.

492
00:28:50,384 --> 00:28:52,484
You said you didn't want to see me and that I should go away.

493
00:28:52,855 --> 00:28:54,894
And now you tell me, there's a child?

494
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:08,904
What's the reason for revealing this after 30 years?

495
00:29:09,545 --> 00:29:10,805
Well...

496
00:29:18,045 --> 00:29:19,454
She's the assistant writer for your drama.

497
00:29:22,825 --> 00:29:24,085
The assistant writer?

498
00:29:28,595 --> 00:29:30,424
I wondered what kind of fate this was.

499
00:29:31,095 --> 00:29:33,095
You would have met once or twice while working together.

500
00:29:33,164 --> 00:29:35,193
The thought of you two in the same space...

501
00:29:35,194 --> 00:29:36,464
not knowing each other...

502
00:29:37,065 --> 00:29:38,634
seemed too harsh.

503
00:29:39,065 --> 00:29:40,375
That's why I decided to tell you.

504
00:29:40,605 --> 00:29:43,274
- I should go meet her right away. - I'll tell her.

505
00:29:43,275 --> 00:29:44,673
Let's go right now. We'll tell her then.

506
00:29:44,674 --> 00:29:47,743
She's going through a lot now. Give her some time.

507
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:49,615
What is it? What is she going through?

508
00:29:50,444 --> 00:29:51,815
How can this happen?

509
00:29:52,855 --> 00:29:54,614
This is big for us,

510
00:29:54,615 --> 00:29:56,354
but you said something bigger happened to our daughter.

511
00:29:56,355 --> 00:29:57,383
So what is that?

512
00:29:57,384 --> 00:30:00,094
Yes, something big happened.

513
00:30:00,095 --> 00:30:01,355
Not us, but our daughter!

514
00:30:01,494 --> 00:30:03,424
Your daughter's name is Woo Ri. Oh Woo Ri.

515
00:30:04,224 --> 00:30:05,424
Oh...

516
00:30:05,664 --> 00:30:08,765
That artificial insemination accident story I told you about...

517
00:30:09,505 --> 00:30:12,104
What if the girl knew who the sperm belonged to?

518
00:30:12,105 --> 00:30:14,575
What would she feel like?

519
00:30:16,275 --> 00:30:18,274
Yes, that's how you should approach this.

520
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:20,575
Gosh. You really are talented for outlandish stories.

521
00:30:20,875 --> 00:30:23,815
You should say that he turned out to be her first love.

522
00:30:24,884 --> 00:30:26,755
And the girl should have secrets about her birth.

523
00:30:27,414 --> 00:30:28,554
Excuse me?

524
00:30:28,555 --> 00:30:30,054
What did you learn from Writer Wang?

525
00:30:30,055 --> 00:30:32,454
Secrets about one's birth are a given.

526
00:30:33,095 --> 00:30:37,024
The middle-aged man she knows turns out to be the father.

527
00:30:37,025 --> 00:30:38,564
That's absurd.

528
00:30:38,565 --> 00:30:40,035
Hey, what's your problem?

529
00:30:40,795 --> 00:30:43,034
You're the one who brought it up.

530
00:30:43,035 --> 00:30:44,065
Hello.

531
00:30:45,265 --> 00:30:46,605
Mr. Choi.

532
00:30:47,035 --> 00:30:48,835
Hello, Seoung Il.

533
00:30:49,805 --> 00:30:52,875
I brought something to eat. Some snacks.

534
00:30:53,015 --> 00:30:54,374
Thank you.

535
00:30:54,375 --> 00:30:56,344
I'll work on the script revision.

536
00:30:56,345 --> 00:30:57,345
No need for that.

537
00:30:57,346 --> 00:31:00,055
I took a look at the script again, and it's perfect.

538
00:31:00,184 --> 00:31:01,654
I don't know what got into me earlier.

539
00:31:01,884 --> 00:31:03,954
No need for revisions. It's perfect.

540
00:31:04,285 --> 00:31:06,723
Are you sure we don't need to revise it?

541
00:31:06,724 --> 00:31:09,154
Of course.

542
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:12,694
I think I was a bit rude earlier.

543
00:31:14,234 --> 00:31:16,964
I wanted to apologize as well.

544
00:31:17,204 --> 00:31:18,865
And to our assistant writer.

545
00:31:19,805 --> 00:31:22,404
Ms. Oh Woo Ri.

546
00:31:23,444 --> 00:31:24,605
Yes?

547
00:31:24,704 --> 00:31:26,744
I don't know what got into me earlier.

548
00:31:26,944 --> 00:31:29,883
I mean you work so hard.

549
00:31:29,884 --> 00:31:32,244
And you're so beautiful.

550
00:31:33,015 --> 00:31:35,383
Didn't you say you didn't have any scenes to shoot today?

551
00:31:35,384 --> 00:31:37,325
Your outfit changed.

552
00:31:37,555 --> 00:31:39,855
It's all about self-maintenance.

553
00:31:40,855 --> 00:31:44,164
I've always done my best in all the shows I've done.

554
00:31:45,424 --> 00:31:49,035
That's why I was able to get to where I am today.

555
00:31:50,305 --> 00:31:54,934
I have 957,000 followers so far.

556
00:31:56,505 --> 00:31:59,545
I'm by far the best amongst all the middle-aged stars.

557
00:32:00,714 --> 00:32:02,884
DiCaprio of the provocative dramas.

558
00:32:05,184 --> 00:32:08,484
You also follow me, don't you?

559
00:32:08,555 --> 00:32:11,154
Yes... Sure.

560
00:32:16,924 --> 00:32:19,295
How have you been?

561
00:32:20,095 --> 00:32:21,994
- Excuse me? - Any troubles?

562
00:32:23,305 --> 00:32:24,504
You don't look so well.

563
00:32:24,505 --> 00:32:26,173
No, that's not it.

564
00:32:26,174 --> 00:32:28,334
I just don't feel myself today, that's all.

565
00:32:28,335 --> 00:32:31,004
Yes, Woo Ri doesn't feel so good today.

566
00:32:31,005 --> 00:32:32,604
She was going to leave early today.

567
00:32:32,605 --> 00:32:35,314
Would you like to leave early? We don't need to revise the script.

568
00:32:35,315 --> 00:32:37,784
Yes, would that be okay?

569
00:32:37,785 --> 00:32:39,514
- Of course. - Then...

570
00:32:39,515 --> 00:32:42,314
I'll give you a ride if you're sick. I was about to leave now.

571
00:32:42,315 --> 00:32:44,555
No, that's okay.

572
00:32:44,984 --> 00:32:47,923
Why don't we talk about the script?

573
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:50,525
What's there to talk about? It's perfect.

574
00:32:51,095 --> 00:32:55,035
You just need to write it as you want.

575
00:32:55,095 --> 00:32:58,304
- Hey, wait... - But since you are here...

576
00:32:58,305 --> 00:33:01,473
I think I can write it properly once you tell me precisely.

577
00:33:01,474 --> 00:33:03,973
What should Chun Sa Da do to Ji Dok Sa here?

578
00:33:03,974 --> 00:33:05,875
I told you it was perfect!

579
00:33:12,855 --> 00:33:14,154
I heard you knew the girl already.

580
00:33:14,414 --> 00:33:16,424
It's someone who works for the drama that we sponsor.

581
00:33:19,255 --> 00:33:20,855
Father should know about it as well.

582
00:33:22,894 --> 00:33:24,264
Ma Ri made a big mistake.

583
00:33:24,265 --> 00:33:26,163
What mistake? She did well.

584
00:33:26,164 --> 00:33:28,493
Ma Ri went over her head and caused this medical mishap.

585
00:33:28,494 --> 00:33:29,933
Both of you need to get it straight.

586
00:33:29,934 --> 00:33:31,434
You should be the one to get this straight.

587
00:33:31,505 --> 00:33:33,034
We can't have our family line cut off here.

588
00:33:33,035 --> 00:33:34,535
It already has!

589
00:33:42,884 --> 00:33:45,214
It won't work. Nothing works.

590
00:33:45,444 --> 00:33:47,454
No matter what I do, it won't work.

591
00:33:48,214 --> 00:33:49,384
What's wrong now?

592
00:33:50,025 --> 00:33:53,154
Raphael just hates me.

593
00:33:59,964 --> 00:34:02,065
Nothing is easy.

594
00:34:03,105 --> 00:34:06,403
You need to think positively.

595
00:34:06,404 --> 00:34:08,275
What do you want me to do when nothing is working?

596
00:34:15,974 --> 00:34:17,514
Stop crying...

597
00:34:18,885 --> 00:34:20,755
and do as your mother tells you to.

598
00:34:21,985 --> 00:34:24,453
If Raphael won't cooperate,

599
00:34:24,454 --> 00:34:25,855
you need to work with someone that will.

600
00:34:27,025 --> 00:34:29,224
The chairman is on our side, isn't he?

601
00:34:30,425 --> 00:34:33,034
You need to work with your father-in-law.

602
00:34:34,394 --> 00:34:35,494
Father?

603
00:34:41,474 --> 00:34:42,534
Darn it.

604
00:34:43,304 --> 00:34:44,404
Who is it?

605
00:34:44,405 --> 00:34:46,374
You can't ignore me.

606
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:48,715
If you want me to keep calling you ma'am...

607
00:34:49,244 --> 00:34:50,784
you need to listen to me.

608
00:35:00,255 --> 00:35:02,094
Make sure you keep this necklace on you.

609
00:35:02,994 --> 00:35:04,565
Only then I'll feel relaxed.

610
00:35:05,795 --> 00:35:08,594
You're still mine.

611
00:35:30,755 --> 00:35:32,784
Don't you know him? He's called Chairman Kim, the drug dealer.

612
00:35:33,295 --> 00:35:36,695
I have my hands on one of the lists that'll make money.

613
00:35:38,724 --> 00:35:40,965
There was a reason why the police came for you.

614
00:35:52,545 --> 00:35:53,974
Right, I didn't tell you.

615
00:35:54,574 --> 00:35:55,843
My shift changed.

616
00:35:55,844 --> 00:35:57,385
I'll come with you to the hospital tomorrow.

617
00:35:58,085 --> 00:35:59,814
What hospital?

618
00:35:59,815 --> 00:36:01,413
Well...

619
00:36:01,414 --> 00:36:03,784
She has dry eyes. She's going in for a prescription.

620
00:36:04,625 --> 00:36:06,124
Yes, that's it.

621
00:36:06,125 --> 00:36:07,454
Okay. Let's go.

622
00:36:11,094 --> 00:36:12,394
That was close.

623
00:36:13,795 --> 00:36:15,235
- Hello. - Hello.

624
00:36:16,635 --> 00:36:17,664
Hello.

625
00:36:25,574 --> 00:36:26,945
Let's see.

626
00:36:33,284 --> 00:36:34,414
Gosh.

627
00:36:35,554 --> 00:36:36,655
Gosh.

628
00:36:42,295 --> 00:36:44,864
Gosh. That feels so good.

629
00:36:46,594 --> 00:36:48,195
Anna, you should try it as well.

630
00:36:48,565 --> 00:36:51,334
I don't need to. My shoulders are fine.

631
00:36:51,335 --> 00:36:52,363
How?

632
00:36:52,364 --> 00:36:56,303
I'm healed when I see my granddaughter Woo Ri.

633
00:36:56,304 --> 00:36:58,175
I have no pain.

634
00:36:58,304 --> 00:37:00,774
If I had a granddaughter like that...

635
00:37:00,775 --> 00:37:02,945
I'd be full without eating.

636
00:37:03,614 --> 00:37:06,614
Veronica, you should take care of yourself.

637
00:37:06,755 --> 00:37:08,384
You had pain all over your body...

638
00:37:08,385 --> 00:37:10,425
when your daughter got divorced last year.

639
00:37:11,655 --> 00:37:14,393
Our Maria hasn't even gone on a trip...

640
00:37:14,394 --> 00:37:17,064
being abstinent.

641
00:37:17,065 --> 00:37:18,094
Anna.

642
00:37:20,164 --> 00:37:21,864
- Anna. - Yes?

643
00:37:22,195 --> 00:37:24,965
- Maria... - What about Woo Ri?

644
00:37:25,905 --> 00:37:27,375
She's pregnant.

645
00:37:30,105 --> 00:37:33,175
Lee Kang Jae, you jerk.

646
00:37:35,844 --> 00:37:37,183
Gosh.

647
00:37:37,184 --> 00:37:38,445
You jerk!

648
00:37:38,514 --> 00:37:40,553
How dare you do this to my granddaughter?

649
00:37:40,554 --> 00:37:42,913
- Grandma, what are you doing? - You good for nothing jerk.

650
00:37:42,914 --> 00:37:45,624
- Grandma. - How dare you touch her?

651
00:37:45,625 --> 00:37:47,893
- What? - What did I do?

652
00:37:47,894 --> 00:37:50,894
It's all over the church that Woo Ri is pregnant.

653
00:37:51,565 --> 00:37:53,264
- What? - Pregnant?

654
00:37:53,664 --> 00:37:56,163
You promised. How could you?

655
00:37:56,164 --> 00:37:59,905
- Grandma. It's not Kang Jae. - What?

656
00:38:00,005 --> 00:38:01,734
What do you mean?

657
00:38:01,735 --> 00:38:05,444
I am pregnant, but it's not Kang Jae.

658
00:38:05,445 --> 00:38:06,514
What?

659
00:38:07,744 --> 00:38:09,715
Then, who?

660
00:38:14,755 --> 00:38:16,155
What's all this?

661
00:38:16,385 --> 00:38:19,724
How could this happen to a girl who has been kind all her life?

662
00:38:20,594 --> 00:38:22,894
Say something.

663
00:38:29,034 --> 00:38:30,304
Anna.

664
00:38:31,034 --> 00:38:33,175
I heard the story,

665
00:38:34,235 --> 00:38:36,203
but it's out of the ordinary.

666
00:38:36,204 --> 00:38:37,945
Should we keep the child since it's new life?

667
00:38:38,704 --> 00:38:42,044
Or have my granddaughter have an abortion and make her a sinner?

668
00:38:42,045 --> 00:38:43,985
What should I do?

669
00:38:44,644 --> 00:38:47,385
Is this why I've been to church all my life?

670
00:38:47,454 --> 00:38:49,784
To have my granddaughter go through such a thing?

671
00:38:50,155 --> 00:38:52,485
What do I do with Woo Ri?

672
00:38:52,724 --> 00:38:56,664
I feel sorry for my Woo Ri.

673
00:38:58,925 --> 00:38:59,965
Anna.

674
00:39:20,085 --> 00:39:21,315
Have some tea.

675
00:39:22,385 --> 00:39:23,425
Yes.

676
00:39:24,385 --> 00:39:25,484
But...

677
00:39:25,485 --> 00:39:28,724
I know it's rude coming to you so suddenly,

678
00:39:29,255 --> 00:39:30,824
but it's such an urgent matter.

679
00:39:32,164 --> 00:39:34,335
Please have my grandchild.

680
00:39:35,264 --> 00:39:36,734
- Excuse me? - My son is the only child...

681
00:39:36,735 --> 00:39:38,304
but he can no longer make babies.

682
00:39:41,105 --> 00:39:42,804
I can't believe my son has no sperm.

683
00:39:43,744 --> 00:39:45,244
He's the eldest son.

684
00:39:45,344 --> 00:39:47,275
It's up to you...

685
00:39:47,574 --> 00:39:48,914
whether my family lives on.

686
00:39:49,744 --> 00:39:51,315
This old man is begging you.

687
00:39:52,215 --> 00:39:53,384
Shall I kneel?

688
00:39:53,385 --> 00:39:56,315
No, this is not that kind of matter.

689
00:39:57,684 --> 00:40:01,194
I understand your unfortunate circumstance.

690
00:40:01,195 --> 00:40:03,494
But as I told you before, I have my circumstances as well.

691
00:40:06,835 --> 00:40:08,394
No need for a longer conversation. Get rid of this.

692
00:40:08,965 --> 00:40:11,534
- Yes? - Get rid of the fruit basket.

693
00:40:12,335 --> 00:40:13,335
Right.

694
00:40:22,614 --> 00:40:24,315
(Fresh Apples)

695
00:40:31,184 --> 00:40:32,454
You should take this.

696
00:40:34,125 --> 00:40:36,025
We have enough apples as well, thank you.

697
00:40:38,125 --> 00:40:39,864
It was difficult in such situations back in the day.

698
00:40:40,195 --> 00:40:42,065
There weren't any 50-dollar bills.

699
00:40:42,735 --> 00:40:44,735
Stuffing the box with ten-dollar bills...

700
00:40:45,065 --> 00:40:46,204
barely came up to 200,000 dollars.

701
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:48,005
It became more convenient now.

702
00:40:48,635 --> 00:40:51,274
I filled up this box with one million dollars...

703
00:40:51,275 --> 00:40:52,445
for you to take.

704
00:40:52,905 --> 00:40:54,643
- Excuse me? - I, Kim Duk Bae,

705
00:40:54,644 --> 00:40:57,144
do not behave that indecently in my old age.

706
00:40:57,545 --> 00:40:59,644
I'm not trying to ruin your life.

707
00:41:00,014 --> 00:41:01,683
We are in a difficult situation...

708
00:41:01,684 --> 00:41:03,524
and ask for a difficult favour.

709
00:41:03,525 --> 00:41:04,784
If you would just have the child,

710
00:41:05,824 --> 00:41:08,224
we will make the right compensation for it.

711
00:41:09,525 --> 00:41:11,795
I'm sorry, Ms. Woo Ri.

712
00:41:11,994 --> 00:41:14,635
I kept on telling you our side of the story...

713
00:41:14,894 --> 00:41:18,565
and left out what we would do for you.

714
00:41:20,405 --> 00:41:22,905
Stay abroad for about ten months.

715
00:41:23,005 --> 00:41:27,344
Think of it as going to a language school.

716
00:41:27,514 --> 00:41:30,013
I'll give you a million now and a million more after the baby.

717
00:41:30,014 --> 00:41:31,545
I'll give you two million in total.

718
00:41:34,914 --> 00:41:36,684
(Fresh Apples)

719
00:41:38,255 --> 00:41:39,625
Two million dollars...

720
00:41:40,894 --> 00:41:42,054
If that's not enough,

721
00:41:42,255 --> 00:41:43,724
just tell me how much you want.

722
00:41:44,125 --> 00:41:45,964
I'll give you as much as you want.

723
00:41:45,965 --> 00:41:48,065
Just have our child, that's all.

724
00:41:51,264 --> 00:41:52,803
She can just give the baby to that family,

725
00:41:52,804 --> 00:41:55,405
get the two million dollars, and turn her life around!

726
00:41:56,105 --> 00:41:59,044
Two million dollars in ten months. Then I'm set for life.

727
00:41:59,045 --> 00:42:00,344
I'd be totally up for that.

728
00:42:01,414 --> 00:42:02,674
It's a private loan.

729
00:42:02,675 --> 00:42:04,045
If you don't pay back,

730
00:42:04,385 --> 00:42:06,754
the interest becomes larger than the principal.

731
00:42:06,755 --> 00:42:08,913
With 50,000 dollars,

732
00:42:08,914 --> 00:42:11,085
I'm confident I can make an album and become a big hit.

733
00:42:22,764 --> 00:42:24,005
You don't want any apples?

734
00:42:25,934 --> 00:42:27,275
At least take the fruit basket.

735
00:42:35,375 --> 00:42:36,744
Father, what do we do?

736
00:42:37,114 --> 00:42:38,715
If she turns down money...

737
00:42:38,914 --> 00:42:40,085
That's how they are at first.

738
00:42:41,054 --> 00:42:43,385
They have their pride in not accepting money right away.

739
00:42:48,054 --> 00:42:49,594
Money solves everything.

740
00:42:58,704 --> 00:42:59,835
Goodness.

741
00:43:00,675 --> 00:43:02,534
What should we do, Woo Ri?

742
00:43:02,704 --> 00:43:03,874
What else is there to talk about?

743
00:43:03,875 --> 00:43:05,275
She'll get an abortion tomorrow at the hospital.

744
00:43:06,275 --> 00:43:08,073
She'll be committing a sin then.

745
00:43:08,074 --> 00:43:10,014
What are you talking about? That's not a sin.

746
00:43:10,585 --> 00:43:11,844
Don't talk like that in front of her.

747
00:43:12,545 --> 00:43:14,655
How could something like this happen to my granddaughter?

748
00:43:15,255 --> 00:43:17,084
Oh, no. What do we do?

749
00:43:17,085 --> 00:43:19,655
Abortion is considered a sin in the eyes of the Lord.

750
00:43:20,695 --> 00:43:21,954
Enough.

751
00:43:22,195 --> 00:43:23,494
Then you expect her to carry out the pregnancy?

752
00:43:23,594 --> 00:43:25,625
Will the Lord give her an award? Will the government give her money?

753
00:43:26,664 --> 00:43:28,335
It's not a sin. She has the right to do so.

754
00:43:29,394 --> 00:43:30,804
Woo Ri's life can't be ruined.

755
00:43:30,905 --> 00:43:32,034
Mom. What about you?

756
00:43:33,105 --> 00:43:34,605
Did I ruin your life?

757
00:43:36,335 --> 00:43:37,343
What?

758
00:43:37,344 --> 00:43:38,804
I won't have the baby, so don't worry.

759
00:43:39,775 --> 00:43:41,474
Why would I complicate my life with a burden?

760
00:43:43,045 --> 00:43:45,715
I will never do something I'll regret for the rest of my life.

761
00:43:48,815 --> 00:43:50,085
Right.

762
00:43:50,525 --> 00:43:52,155
You should get an abortion, right?

763
00:43:52,885 --> 00:43:55,894
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.

764
00:43:57,065 --> 00:43:59,695
I'm all right, Grandma. Don't worry.

765
00:44:01,994 --> 00:44:03,164
Okay.

766
00:44:46,775 --> 00:44:48,014
Should I turn on the radio?

767
00:44:49,014 --> 00:44:51,885
- Love isn't a joke - Goodness.

768
00:44:56,684 --> 00:44:57,885
I'm sorry.

769
00:45:04,494 --> 00:45:05,763
(Rosy OB-GYN Clinic)

770
00:45:05,764 --> 00:45:08,094
Thank you for coming all the way here.

771
00:45:08,264 --> 00:45:10,505
Please come this way.

772
00:45:14,875 --> 00:45:16,034
This way.

773
00:45:16,735 --> 00:45:17,974
Ma'am, here.

774
00:45:18,105 --> 00:45:20,244
Ma'am. Woo Ri.

775
00:45:25,385 --> 00:45:27,014
What are you doing here?

776
00:45:28,085 --> 00:45:29,355
Who are they?

777
00:45:29,855 --> 00:45:31,084
I would like to...

778
00:45:31,085 --> 00:45:32,954
discuss something with you.

779
00:45:35,324 --> 00:45:38,324
So you want my daughter to have the baby. Right?

780
00:45:38,625 --> 00:45:40,433
Yes. But...

781
00:45:40,434 --> 00:45:42,164
Get up. We don't need to hear it.

782
00:45:42,465 --> 00:45:43,933
Gosh. Please.

783
00:45:43,934 --> 00:45:46,204
I'm sorry. Please sit down.

784
00:45:46,664 --> 00:45:48,105
I'm sorry, ma'am.

785
00:45:50,605 --> 00:45:51,704
You know,

786
00:45:51,875 --> 00:45:55,815
I worked day and night and became successful all on my own.

787
00:45:56,644 --> 00:45:58,184
I don't want much at this age.

788
00:45:59,085 --> 00:46:01,855
I only have one son. But my son...

789
00:46:04,525 --> 00:46:06,155
I can't believe he has no sperm.

790
00:46:07,525 --> 00:46:09,155
He's the eldest son.

791
00:46:09,425 --> 00:46:10,994
That's your problem.

792
00:46:11,094 --> 00:46:13,024
That's none of our business.

793
00:46:13,025 --> 00:46:14,764
How could you be so harsh?

794
00:46:15,065 --> 00:46:17,335
What if there's no one left to hold a memorial service for you?

795
00:46:17,835 --> 00:46:19,034
Would you be happy with that?

796
00:46:19,434 --> 00:46:20,735
We are Catholic.

797
00:46:23,034 --> 00:46:24,505
Then should I let my lineage stop here?

798
00:46:25,275 --> 00:46:26,544
Do you want my granddaughter...

799
00:46:26,545 --> 00:46:28,215
to ruin her life just for your lineage?

800
00:46:28,474 --> 00:46:30,044
Well, you see,

801
00:46:30,045 --> 00:46:32,244
we don't plan to make a ridiculous demand.

802
00:46:32,545 --> 00:46:35,013
We offered reasonable compensation to your daughter.

803
00:46:35,014 --> 00:46:36,154
Reasonable compensation?

804
00:46:36,155 --> 00:46:38,524
How can you reasonably compensate her for ruining her life?

805
00:46:38,525 --> 00:46:41,025
You can stay abroad for as long as you want.

806
00:46:41,224 --> 00:46:43,093
We will make sure it stays confidential.

807
00:46:43,094 --> 00:46:45,163
And we will also compensate her financially too.

808
00:46:45,164 --> 00:46:46,964
You're asking my daughter to be a surrogate mother.

809
00:46:46,965 --> 00:46:48,234
You want her to sell the baby for money.

810
00:46:48,235 --> 00:46:49,464
They are unbelievable.

811
00:46:49,465 --> 00:46:50,764
Two million dollars.

812
00:46:51,304 --> 00:46:52,804
We offered two million dollars.

813
00:46:53,635 --> 00:46:55,304
We can give you more if you request it.

814
00:46:56,275 --> 00:46:58,703
That money will not ruin your life.

815
00:46:58,704 --> 00:47:00,815
It can give you a new chance at life.

816
00:47:02,014 --> 00:47:03,545
It's the kind of money...

817
00:47:04,284 --> 00:47:06,114
even your mother and grandmother won't ever get to make.

818
00:47:07,454 --> 00:47:09,355
It's two million dollars.

819
00:47:21,994 --> 00:47:24,203
I told you I needed 50,000 dollars to make my album.

820
00:47:24,204 --> 00:47:27,174
They won't let a single mom become a singer.

821
00:47:27,175 --> 00:47:28,505
I had to give that up to raise you.

822
00:47:30,235 --> 00:47:32,244
It would've been better if I were ten years younger.

823
00:47:32,505 --> 00:47:34,675
If I didn't have Woo Ri back then...

824
00:47:39,215 --> 00:47:40,414
Two million dollars?

825
00:47:41,855 --> 00:47:43,114
You want her to carry out the pregnancy?

826
00:47:44,684 --> 00:47:45,824
Two million dollars?

827
00:47:48,324 --> 00:47:50,295
The answer is no even if you offer 20 million dollars.

828
00:47:50,625 --> 00:47:51,764
Why?

829
00:47:51,925 --> 00:47:53,324
Woo Ri is my daughter.

830
00:47:54,735 --> 00:47:56,434
You think money can solve everything, right?

831
00:47:57,465 --> 00:47:58,965
There are things you can't do with money.

832
00:47:59,505 --> 00:48:00,775
Not my daughter.

833
00:48:00,905 --> 00:48:02,235
You can't ruin her life...

834
00:48:03,534 --> 00:48:04,804
even if it can save my life.

835
00:48:09,974 --> 00:48:11,614
Ma'am. Why are you so unreasonable?

836
00:48:12,244 --> 00:48:13,585
Will she die from it?

837
00:48:13,855 --> 00:48:16,255
We're simply asking her to have the baby.

838
00:48:16,614 --> 00:48:18,723
Should we kill the baby in her womb?

839
00:48:18,724 --> 00:48:19,824
Will you commit murder?

840
00:48:20,054 --> 00:48:21,494
Hey! Watch your mouth!

841
00:48:22,324 --> 00:48:24,025
If you bring up money again,

842
00:48:24,425 --> 00:48:26,124
I'll arrest you all for violating Clause 3 of Article 23...

843
00:48:26,125 --> 00:48:28,634
of the Enforcement Rule of Bioethics and Safety Act.

844
00:48:28,635 --> 00:48:30,464
Who are you? A lawyer?

845
00:48:30,465 --> 00:48:31,534
When did you get here?

846
00:48:35,335 --> 00:48:36,675
What are you doing?

847
00:48:37,144 --> 00:48:39,045
Why are you meeting with them?

848
00:48:40,644 --> 00:48:42,414
I told you this was illegal.

849
00:48:45,184 --> 00:48:46,344
I'm sorry.

850
00:48:47,014 --> 00:48:50,855
I would like to apologize to you and your family.

851
00:48:51,554 --> 00:48:53,954
Please forget everything...

852
00:48:54,525 --> 00:48:55,824
they told you.

853
00:48:59,625 --> 00:49:01,594
Well, sir.

854
00:49:03,335 --> 00:49:04,434
Yes?

855
00:49:08,135 --> 00:49:09,275
Woo Ri.

856
00:49:11,105 --> 00:49:12,405
This way. Let's go.

857
00:49:48,574 --> 00:49:50,114
Goodness.

858
00:49:52,684 --> 00:49:53,855
Did it go well?

859
00:49:53,954 --> 00:49:55,454
You said it was a simple procedure.

860
00:49:56,284 --> 00:49:57,324
What?

861
00:49:57,925 --> 00:49:59,755
- Ma'am. - Mother.

862
00:50:00,385 --> 00:50:02,255
- Are you all right? - Are you okay?

863
00:50:05,224 --> 00:50:06,795
- Be careful. - I can't believe this.

864
00:50:24,914 --> 00:50:29,054
My mother had me as a teenager when she was still in school.

865
00:50:30,885 --> 00:50:32,755
Even I don't know what to do at the age of 29.

866
00:50:33,355 --> 00:50:35,625
She must have had a lot on her mind.

867
00:50:37,094 --> 00:50:38,625
How scared she must have been.

868
00:50:40,664 --> 00:50:45,065
But she must have had a reason when she decided to have me.

869
00:50:46,204 --> 00:50:48,675
There must be a reason why I'm in this world...

870
00:50:49,875 --> 00:50:53,405
and why something like this happened to me too.

871
00:50:54,875 --> 00:50:56,275
There must be a reason for that.

872
00:51:06,925 --> 00:51:08,324
She's still not answering her phone.

873
00:51:09,855 --> 00:51:11,594
Where did she go?

874
00:51:13,795 --> 00:51:15,764
Woo Ri. Where have you been?

875
00:51:16,235 --> 00:51:17,505
Why didn't you go through with the surgery?

876
00:51:17,804 --> 00:51:19,104
Woo Ri.

877
00:51:19,105 --> 00:51:21,175
You're not considering their offer, right?

878
00:51:21,405 --> 00:51:24,244
Don't give a thought to what those jerks said.

879
00:51:25,744 --> 00:51:27,005
Mom.

880
00:51:27,275 --> 00:51:29,215
Grandma. Kang Jae.

881
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:31,315
I'm going to...

882
00:51:32,244 --> 00:51:33,514
have this baby.

883
00:51:38,184 --> 00:51:39,954
What do you mean? Why would you?

884
00:51:40,355 --> 00:51:42,054
You were a victim of a medical accident.

885
00:51:42,394 --> 00:51:44,425
This is the same as getting infected at the hospital.

886
00:51:45,025 --> 00:51:46,224
Then what about me?

887
00:51:46,894 --> 00:51:48,034
Was I an accident too?

888
00:51:48,565 --> 00:51:49,735
Was I an infection?

889
00:51:51,005 --> 00:51:52,163
What?

890
00:51:52,164 --> 00:51:53,704
Why did you have me?

891
00:51:54,875 --> 00:51:56,275
Do you regret having me?

892
00:51:56,835 --> 00:51:59,104
What are you talking about? Why would I regret having you?

893
00:51:59,105 --> 00:52:00,175
Mom.

894
00:52:00,715 --> 00:52:02,244
When I was in middle school,

895
00:52:03,114 --> 00:52:04,444
I heard you say...

896
00:52:04,445 --> 00:52:06,045
you shouldn't have given birth to me.

897
00:52:06,644 --> 00:52:08,355
You couldn't be a singer because of me.

898
00:52:09,885 --> 00:52:13,125
What you said had scarred me my entire life.

899
00:52:14,724 --> 00:52:16,025
It didn't go away.

900
00:52:17,324 --> 00:52:19,025
I was a burden to you.

901
00:52:21,195 --> 00:52:23,394
I didn't want people to look down on me.

902
00:52:23,965 --> 00:52:26,164
I didn't want to make even a single mistake.

903
00:52:27,105 --> 00:52:29,005
That's why I pledged to abstain.

904
00:52:30,474 --> 00:52:31,644
Woo Ri.

905
00:52:32,844 --> 00:52:34,114
I thought...

906
00:52:35,514 --> 00:52:37,243
you went through with the pledge...

907
00:52:37,244 --> 00:52:39,085
because you were embarrassed that I had you at 16.

908
00:52:40,144 --> 00:52:42,655
I never thought I couldn't be a singer because of you.

909
00:52:43,614 --> 00:52:45,654
I wanted to be a successful singer...

910
00:52:45,655 --> 00:52:48,454
because I wanted to be a mom you could be proud of.

911
00:52:49,954 --> 00:52:52,494
I don't care what my job is. I have you.

912
00:52:53,795 --> 00:52:55,434
There were so many moments...

913
00:52:56,264 --> 00:52:58,704
you made me happy ever since you were born.

914
00:53:01,275 --> 00:53:04,905
It's quite the opposite. I always felt bad for you.

915
00:53:05,945 --> 00:53:07,914
The thing you tell me the most is...

916
00:53:08,914 --> 00:53:12,885
"Mom, why do you live like that?"

917
00:53:14,554 --> 00:53:16,085
I'm not good at anything.

918
00:53:16,715 --> 00:53:18,084
I always cause trouble.

919
00:53:18,085 --> 00:53:19,985
I'm far from being a perfect mother.

920
00:53:21,454 --> 00:53:23,425
You're embarrassed of me.

921
00:53:26,594 --> 00:53:28,195
No, Mom.

922
00:53:29,394 --> 00:53:31,465
Why would I be embarrassed of you?

923
00:53:37,545 --> 00:53:39,344
I'm so proud...

924
00:53:39,974 --> 00:53:42,974
that you are working so hard to achieve your dream.

925
00:53:45,184 --> 00:53:46,885
You're my mom.

926
00:53:47,655 --> 00:53:49,914
You brought me into this world.

927
00:53:51,954 --> 00:53:55,594
I wouldn't trade you for anything in the world.

928
00:54:05,605 --> 00:54:09,105
You just healed the scar in my heart.

929
00:54:10,474 --> 00:54:12,644
You don't have to tell me why you decided to keep me.

930
00:54:13,574 --> 00:54:15,445
I know why.

931
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:18,885
I'm the reason why.

932
00:54:20,985 --> 00:54:22,114
Woo Ri.

933
00:54:30,925 --> 00:54:32,025
Mom.

934
00:54:34,164 --> 00:54:36,295
You gave me a chance.

935
00:54:37,335 --> 00:54:39,764
So I'm loved by so many people in my life.

936
00:54:42,704 --> 00:54:46,644
Now, I want to give a chance to this baby.

937
00:54:52,715 --> 00:54:54,045
Why you?

938
00:54:55,585 --> 00:54:57,355
Why did this happen to you?

939
00:55:14,574 --> 00:55:16,335
Do you think having a baby is easy?

940
00:55:16,605 --> 00:55:17,804
You think it will just come to you?

941
00:55:18,175 --> 00:55:19,843
It's a huge responsibility.

942
00:55:19,844 --> 00:55:22,315
I know that too. I'm ready for it.

943
00:55:23,244 --> 00:55:24,843
When your mother told me...

944
00:55:24,844 --> 00:55:28,215
she was pregnant 30 years ago, I didn't think about anything.

945
00:55:28,784 --> 00:55:32,084
A 16-year-old girl was pregnant. I told her to get rid of it.

946
00:55:32,085 --> 00:55:35,094
I dragged her to the hospital to get an abortion right away.

947
00:55:35,795 --> 00:55:39,264
But your mother ran away.

948
00:55:40,594 --> 00:55:42,635
She's a good runner.

949
00:55:42,835 --> 00:55:44,864
If she wasn't a good runner,

950
00:55:48,304 --> 00:55:51,275
it would have been a huge problem.

951
00:55:52,204 --> 00:55:56,114
I don't know why I was so against it back then.

952
00:55:56,675 --> 00:56:00,244
I prayed and repented all my life.

953
00:56:03,614 --> 00:56:07,054
But you and your mother are in different shoes.

954
00:56:07,255 --> 00:56:09,124
You didn't do anything.

955
00:56:09,125 --> 00:56:11,524
You didn't do anything that requires you to be responsible.

956
00:56:11,525 --> 00:56:12,724
I know that.

957
00:56:13,025 --> 00:56:17,363
But still. I have a chance to bring a baby into this world.

958
00:56:17,364 --> 00:56:19,534
You have a very beautiful, generous heart.

959
00:56:20,235 --> 00:56:23,335
But still. Why must you do it?

960
00:56:24,105 --> 00:56:27,444
Grandma. If Mary's grandma was against it,

961
00:56:27,445 --> 00:56:29,073
Jesus wouldn't have been born.

962
00:56:29,074 --> 00:56:32,084
You're not Virgin Mary. Will you give birth to Jesus?

963
00:56:32,085 --> 00:56:33,744
That's my religious name too.

964
00:56:34,454 --> 00:56:36,114
You gave that name to me.

965
00:56:37,054 --> 00:56:39,184
Goodness. Oh, no.

966
00:56:39,684 --> 00:56:40,954
Oh, no.

967
00:56:49,034 --> 00:56:50,364
- Gosh. - We'll be okay.

968
00:56:52,804 --> 00:56:55,534
(Seo Gwi Nyeo's Pork Cutlet)

969
00:57:05,844 --> 00:57:07,144
Must you have this baby?

970
00:57:12,925 --> 00:57:14,295
I'm sorry.

971
00:57:19,565 --> 00:57:23,534
I know that my decision right now is very unrealistic.

972
00:57:25,364 --> 00:57:28,034
Just ask anyone on the street.

973
00:57:29,074 --> 00:57:30,574
They will say I'm crazy.

974
00:57:32,545 --> 00:57:33,605
Right.

975
00:57:34,945 --> 00:57:36,875
To be honest, it's not easy for me either.

976
00:57:38,644 --> 00:57:40,985
Even my family can't understand me.

977
00:57:42,184 --> 00:57:44,724
I won't ask you to understand my decision.

978
00:57:53,324 --> 00:57:56,135
I'm sorry for making a selfish decision.

979
00:58:00,364 --> 00:58:02,473
But I don't have the right to stop you...

980
00:58:02,474 --> 00:58:04,275
from making that decision.

981
00:58:05,775 --> 00:58:06,945
I'll just...

982
00:58:08,344 --> 00:58:11,385
I'll just help you make a wise decision.

983
00:58:16,014 --> 00:58:17,085
Kang Jae.

984
00:58:28,094 --> 00:58:29,195
Woo Ri.

985
00:58:30,335 --> 00:58:31,465
It's okay.

986
00:58:32,764 --> 00:58:34,105
I'm sorry.

987
00:58:36,375 --> 00:58:37,375
Yes!

988
00:58:48,985 --> 00:58:50,985
- Hello? - Ms. Oh?

989
00:58:51,554 --> 00:58:52,824
This is Raphael.

990
00:58:53,355 --> 00:58:54,954
Hello.

991
00:58:56,925 --> 00:58:58,323
What's this about?

992
00:58:58,324 --> 00:59:00,425
The hospital said you didn't get the procedure.

993
00:59:00,565 --> 00:59:01,934
I was wondering what happened.

994
00:59:02,335 --> 00:59:04,195
If there's a problem, I'll help too.

995
00:59:04,534 --> 00:59:06,105
There's no problem.

996
00:59:06,704 --> 00:59:10,275
Actually, there was something I need to tell you in person.

997
00:59:11,875 --> 00:59:14,573
Are you free tomorrow morning?

998
00:59:14,574 --> 00:59:16,144
I'll go to your hospital.

999
00:59:16,445 --> 00:59:20,414
Sure. But what's this about?

1000
00:59:21,284 --> 00:59:23,614
I'll tell you in person.

1001
00:59:36,394 --> 00:59:37,593
You're certain, right?

1002
00:59:37,594 --> 00:59:39,405
Yes!

1003
00:59:39,605 --> 00:59:41,203
She said she would have the baby.

1004
00:59:41,204 --> 00:59:42,774
I had a feeling she would...

1005
00:59:42,775 --> 00:59:44,604
when she left without getting the procedure.

1006
00:59:44,605 --> 00:59:47,105
There's always a way out!

1007
00:59:47,304 --> 00:59:49,574
You were right about everything.

1008
00:59:49,644 --> 00:59:51,784
- We must be positive. - We must be positive.

1009
01:00:03,155 --> 01:00:04,525
It was perfect until now.

1010
01:00:05,494 --> 01:00:07,224
I forgot about this problem.

1011
01:00:08,695 --> 01:00:11,064
Mom. What do I do?

1012
01:00:11,065 --> 01:00:14,704
We can't mess up our grand plan because of a bug.

1013
01:00:15,735 --> 01:00:17,335
Gosh. There's a bug!

1014
01:00:35,894 --> 01:00:37,155
Hey, you're here.

1015
01:00:37,795 --> 01:00:41,094
If that couple is the parent, the baby will be happy for sure.

1016
01:00:41,735 --> 01:00:45,163
But we should discuss this thoroughly with the couple.

1017
01:00:45,164 --> 01:00:47,104
It won't be as easy as you might think.

1018
01:00:47,105 --> 01:00:48,835
We'll have to draw up legal documents too.

1019
01:00:49,335 --> 01:00:50,905
So...

1020
01:00:51,405 --> 01:00:54,105
we should talk to them first.

1021
01:00:54,815 --> 01:00:57,074
If you don't agree with them, you can change your mind.

1022
01:00:58,644 --> 01:01:00,445
- Kang Jae. - Yes?

1023
01:01:01,255 --> 01:01:03,715
I'm so relieved to have you by my side.

1024
01:01:15,195 --> 01:01:16,534
Hello.

1025
01:01:17,094 --> 01:01:19,704
Thank you for coming to our hospital.

1026
01:01:26,005 --> 01:01:27,105
No Man Chul.

1027
01:01:33,485 --> 01:01:34,585
No Man Chul!

1028
01:01:35,784 --> 01:01:36,815
No Man Chul!

1029
01:02:04,244 --> 01:02:08,985

1031
01:02:26,105 --> 01:02:30,135
Gosh. It turned out Raphael used to be quite the party boy.

1032
01:02:30,204 --> 01:02:33,405
I want this baby to grow up in the perfect family.

1033
01:02:33,574 --> 01:02:35,315
Of course. I agree.

1034
01:02:35,375 --> 01:02:37,743
The wife desperately wants to have a baby.

1035
01:02:37,744 --> 01:02:39,544
And I thought she would be a great mother.

1036
01:02:39,545 --> 01:02:41,953
You know, the CEO is a total player.

1037
01:02:41,954 --> 01:02:44,054
What do I do? Would I be able to raise this baby well?

1038
01:02:44,184 --> 01:02:46,453
You want us to raise the baby.

1039
01:02:46,454 --> 01:02:48,553
You and I are on the same boat now.

1040
01:02:48,554 --> 01:02:51,363
Raphael? Can you look into him, Kang Jae?

1041
01:02:51,364 --> 01:02:53,525
I saw something fishy with my own eyes.

1042
01:02:53,724 --> 01:02:55,094
We've met before. Right?

1043
