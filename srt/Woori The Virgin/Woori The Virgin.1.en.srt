00:00:38,634 --> 00:00:42,174
(Abstinence Pledge)

10
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:47,414
Do you promise to abstain from sex until marriage?

11
00:00:47,415 --> 00:00:48,585
Yes.

12
00:00:55,024 --> 00:00:57,224
Do you promise to the Lord that you will abstain...

13
00:00:57,225 --> 00:00:58,594
- from sex until marriage? - Yes.

14
00:00:58,795 --> 00:01:00,094
(Oh Woo Ri)

15
00:01:03,295 --> 00:01:05,894
Mom, are you sure this is the right thing for her?

16
00:01:15,404 --> 00:01:16,604
Oh Woo Ri Maria.

17
00:01:17,345 --> 00:01:19,174
Do you promise to the Lord that you will abstain...

18
00:01:19,175 --> 00:01:20,514
from sex until marriage?

19
00:01:34,964 --> 00:01:36,164
That's me.

20
00:01:36,165 --> 00:01:37,494
Me 15 years ago.

21
00:01:39,434 --> 00:01:41,904
Why did they make kids go through something like that before?

22
00:01:42,134 --> 00:01:43,733
This decision was totally up to our personal freedom.

23
00:01:43,734 --> 00:01:45,475
How could anyone tell us what to do?

24
00:01:48,244 --> 00:01:49,945
We were so clueless. But what?

25
00:01:50,744 --> 00:01:51,975
"Abstinence Pledge"?

26
00:01:52,315 --> 00:01:53,714
You want us to make that pledge?

27
00:01:59,684 --> 00:02:00,755
Yes.

28
00:02:01,425 --> 00:02:03,124
So no sex until marriage?

29
00:02:03,255 --> 00:02:04,554
Men and women...

30
00:02:04,555 --> 00:02:07,455
who are perfectly healthy won't do it in the 21st century?

31
00:02:10,095 --> 00:02:11,464
Is that possible?

32
00:02:39,195 --> 00:02:40,994
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

33
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:42,595
You looked gorgeous today.

34
00:02:43,595 --> 00:02:45,864
Gosh. I should have gotten the bouquet.

35
00:02:47,435 --> 00:02:49,034
Right. I guess I was lucky.

36
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:51,775
Oh, right. When you were in school,

37
00:02:53,704 --> 00:02:55,745
you said you had to abstain until marriage.

38
00:02:56,345 --> 00:02:57,643
Is abstaining from sex a crime?

39
00:02:57,644 --> 00:02:58,945
Why should she care about others?

40
00:02:59,044 --> 00:03:00,415
It's not a crime.

41
00:03:00,475 --> 00:03:03,044
But not having it isn't common.

42
00:03:03,245 --> 00:03:04,583
- Come on. - Sex.

43
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:06,815
- Come on. Be quiet. - What?

44
00:03:06,954 --> 00:03:08,025
Why must we call it "it"?

45
00:03:08,324 --> 00:03:10,125
How is not having sex going to affect our lives?

46
00:03:10,354 --> 00:03:11,893
Besides, instead of calling it the abstinence pledge,

47
00:03:11,894 --> 00:03:13,095
let's call it sex after marriage.

48
00:03:13,225 --> 00:03:14,565
Isn't that a more proper term?

49
00:03:15,025 --> 00:03:16,324
Gosh. Sure.

50
00:03:16,465 --> 00:03:18,763
So you don't even date men?

51
00:03:18,764 --> 00:03:20,034
No.

52
00:03:20,035 --> 00:03:22,764
I watched her date men ever since her first boyfriend.

53
00:03:23,204 --> 00:03:24,333
- Woo Ri. - She was popular...

54
00:03:24,334 --> 00:03:25,633
- even as a freshman. - Move it.

55
00:03:25,634 --> 00:03:27,103
As you can see, she's pretty.

56
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:28,104
- Move it! - Come on.

57
00:03:28,604 --> 00:03:29,944
But men started to avoid her...

58
00:03:29,945 --> 00:03:31,315
when they found out about the pledge.

59
00:03:32,475 --> 00:03:33,644
Gosh, men.

60
00:03:33,715 --> 00:03:35,414
What about you? Can you handle it?

61
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:38,514
If you don't do it, don't you get sexually frustrated?

62
00:03:38,715 --> 00:03:40,613
- I just... - After years of holding back,

63
00:03:40,614 --> 00:03:42,984
I watched her frustration and desires explode in one go.

64
00:03:43,084 --> 00:03:45,394
Right. On the senior trip.

65
00:03:50,924 --> 00:03:53,495
That was her first kiss.

66
00:03:53,595 --> 00:03:54,934
Did things work out with that guy?

67
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:56,435
That was the last of him.

68
00:03:56,864 --> 00:03:58,333
She didn't even get his number.

69
00:03:58,334 --> 00:04:01,103
Then when was your real first relationship?

70
00:04:01,104 --> 00:04:03,475
The antonym of abstinence is love life.

71
00:04:03,945 --> 00:04:05,174
Do you think dating is possible?

72
00:04:05,415 --> 00:04:07,614
Then I can take the bouquet.

73
00:04:07,845 --> 00:04:08,984
No, wait.

74
00:04:09,144 --> 00:04:12,084
- I have a boyfriend. - What?

75
00:04:13,054 --> 00:04:14,415
We've been dating for two years.

76
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,424
Really?

77
00:04:17,384 --> 00:04:19,525
See? He's calling me.

78
00:04:20,525 --> 00:04:22,864
Hey, honey. Are you here?

79
00:04:22,994 --> 00:04:24,934
I'll be out in a minute. Okay.

80
00:04:29,135 --> 00:04:30,265
Honey!

81
00:04:48,124 --> 00:04:49,484
- Is it over? - Yes.

82
00:04:50,025 --> 00:04:51,124
I didn't wait for long.

83
00:04:51,854 --> 00:04:53,124
He's so hot.

84
00:04:53,924 --> 00:04:55,324
- You go, girl. - Your hair.

85
00:04:55,325 --> 00:04:57,123
Where could we meet guys like him?

86
00:04:57,124 --> 00:04:58,994
I've been single for a long time.

87
00:04:59,194 --> 00:05:00,835
So they've been dating for two years?

88
00:05:00,965 --> 00:05:04,104
I guess her dry spell is over now.

89
00:05:05,475 --> 00:05:07,475
What? Woo Ri. What are those flowers?

90
00:05:08,304 --> 00:05:09,775
Did you catch the bouquet?

91
00:05:11,475 --> 00:05:13,215
No.

92
00:05:13,845 --> 00:05:16,215
It was on the table. They told me to take it.

93
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:21,624
Kang Jae, I think we might have enough time.

94
00:05:24,225 --> 00:05:25,655
Should we stop by there first?

95
00:05:26,325 --> 00:05:28,364
(Motel)

96
00:05:40,804 --> 00:05:42,075
I didn't want to buy just one.

97
00:05:42,705 --> 00:05:43,874
So I bought a lot.

98
00:05:46,374 --> 00:05:47,575
Good.

99
00:05:49,145 --> 00:05:51,915
Kang Jae, should we go in now?

100
00:06:08,564 --> 00:06:10,665
- Here. Get home safely. - Get home safely.

101
00:06:10,835 --> 00:06:12,905
See you next time. Get home safely.

102
00:06:13,504 --> 00:06:16,205
- Hey, there. Get home safely. - Get home safely.

103
00:06:16,775 --> 00:06:18,015
You should go home and rest up.

104
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:20,345
You must be exhausted after the evening mass.

105
00:06:21,785 --> 00:06:23,044
I'm all right.

106
00:06:24,415 --> 00:06:26,314
What about you? Aren't you tired?

107
00:06:27,015 --> 00:06:28,155
No.

108
00:06:28,484 --> 00:06:29,725
I'm healthy, you know.

109
00:06:34,765 --> 00:06:37,294
Are you sure you're okay?

110
00:06:37,994 --> 00:06:39,265
What do you mean?

111
00:06:39,434 --> 00:06:41,034
You come here all the time because of me.

112
00:06:41,035 --> 00:06:42,035
Are you okay with it?

113
00:06:43,405 --> 00:06:44,804
Why are you suddenly asking me that?

114
00:06:45,075 --> 00:06:46,103
Did something happen?

115
00:06:46,104 --> 00:06:48,145
No, this has been on my mind for a while.

116
00:06:49,244 --> 00:06:50,443
We've been dating for two years.

117
00:06:50,444 --> 00:06:52,614
But we spend most of our time at church.

118
00:06:52,845 --> 00:06:54,743
I've never been to your house.

119
00:06:54,744 --> 00:06:56,043
And we've never gone on a trip, just the two of us.

120
00:06:56,044 --> 00:06:57,314
We never have fun.

121
00:06:58,054 --> 00:07:00,415
And fun is not the only thing we're not having.

122
00:07:02,085 --> 00:07:03,354
I have you.

123
00:07:04,354 --> 00:07:05,595
That's all I need.

124
00:07:06,424 --> 00:07:07,854
We don't have to do anything else.

125
00:07:08,965 --> 00:07:10,665
But it's tough on you, right?

126
00:07:10,825 --> 00:07:12,265
I knew what I was getting into.

127
00:07:13,465 --> 00:07:16,535
I asked you out when I knew my feelings for you were serious,

128
00:07:17,135 --> 00:07:18,335
and I was willing to wait for you.

129
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:21,174
I consider your principle more valuable...

130
00:07:24,244 --> 00:07:26,215
than having a typical relationship.

131
00:07:40,054 --> 00:07:41,325
No.

132
00:07:44,934 --> 00:07:46,535
We should go. Let's go now.

133
00:07:47,535 --> 00:07:48,704
Again?

134
00:07:48,705 --> 00:07:50,405
(Priest)

135
00:07:51,575 --> 00:07:53,705
Father. I need to make a confession.

136
00:07:53,835 --> 00:07:55,044
Kang Jae.

137
00:07:55,604 --> 00:07:58,113
Enough with your confessions.

138
00:07:58,114 --> 00:07:59,943
I had another bad thought.

139
00:07:59,944 --> 00:08:01,514
That's not even that bad.

140
00:08:01,515 --> 00:08:03,044
Can't a man have thoughts?

141
00:08:03,744 --> 00:08:04,853
But still.

142
00:08:04,854 --> 00:08:07,885
Making confessions every other day is too much.

143
00:08:08,124 --> 00:08:09,885
The Lord and I are busy too.

144
00:08:10,885 --> 00:08:12,924
You two should just get married.

145
00:08:13,294 --> 00:08:15,194
Isn't it about time?

146
00:08:20,564 --> 00:08:21,734
Bye, Woo Ri.

147
00:08:38,855 --> 00:08:40,915
(Seo Gwi Nyeo's Pork Cutlet)

148
00:08:50,594 --> 00:08:51,793
Gosh.

149
00:08:51,794 --> 00:08:53,635
Gosh, Mom.

150
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:55,704
- Woo Ri. - What?

151
00:08:56,365 --> 00:08:57,535
- I'll call you. - Oh, my.

152
00:08:57,934 --> 00:08:59,005
Goodness.

153
00:08:59,635 --> 00:09:00,774
- Mom. - What?

154
00:09:00,775 --> 00:09:02,473
Why did you do that in the car?

155
00:09:02,474 --> 00:09:04,574
Then should I kiss him outside the car, not inside?

156
00:09:05,314 --> 00:09:06,775
- Button up. - What?

157
00:09:06,915 --> 00:09:08,015
- See you, baby. - Bye.

158
00:09:08,485 --> 00:09:10,645
You're embarrassing me in front of our neighbours. Come in.

159
00:09:10,745 --> 00:09:11,914
Okay.

160
00:09:11,915 --> 00:09:14,054
- Mom. - We're home.

161
00:09:14,584 --> 00:09:15,684
Hey.

162
00:09:15,785 --> 00:09:17,323
You guys came home together.

163
00:09:17,324 --> 00:09:19,395
- We met in front of the restaurant. - I see.

164
00:09:19,594 --> 00:09:20,824
Did your boyfriend get a new car?

165
00:09:20,995 --> 00:09:22,464
No, he didn't.

166
00:09:22,724 --> 00:09:24,665
- I'm with a new guy. - What?

167
00:09:25,135 --> 00:09:26,994
- I'm seeing someone else. - Why?

168
00:09:26,995 --> 00:09:28,534
Since when? Why?

169
00:09:28,535 --> 00:09:30,303
Do I need a reason to fall in love?

170
00:09:30,304 --> 00:09:31,934
Why do I need a reason? Why?

171
00:09:33,135 --> 00:09:35,044
Mom, seriously.

172
00:09:35,574 --> 00:09:36,673
Mom.

173
00:09:36,674 --> 00:09:38,774
I told you I needed 50,000 dollars to make my album.

174
00:09:38,775 --> 00:09:40,744
I told you we didn't have that kind of money.

175
00:09:40,745 --> 00:09:42,015
I got the money.

176
00:09:42,245 --> 00:09:44,313
My new boyfriend is a producer.

177
00:09:44,314 --> 00:09:45,655
- He'll take care of everything. - What?

178
00:09:45,814 --> 00:09:47,084
The guy in the car is a producer?

179
00:09:47,255 --> 00:09:48,924
You were making out with a producer?

180
00:09:49,285 --> 00:09:50,724
Are you sure it won't cost you anything?

181
00:09:51,155 --> 00:09:52,754
You won't get mixed up in any more trouble, right?

182
00:09:52,755 --> 00:09:54,224
To daughters, foes are their mothers.

183
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:55,625
To mothers, foes are their daughters.

184
00:09:55,765 --> 00:09:57,395
You guys are always on the same side.

185
00:10:02,005 --> 00:10:03,505
Mom. Woo Ri.

186
00:10:03,635 --> 00:10:06,275
I think I'm going to make it this time.

187
00:10:06,974 --> 00:10:08,644
I've been dreaming of becoming a singer ever since middle school.

188
00:10:08,645 --> 00:10:09,875
It took me 30 years.

189
00:10:11,105 --> 00:10:12,674
I had to give that up to raise you.

190
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:16,015
It would've been better if I were ten years younger.

191
00:10:17,145 --> 00:10:18,285
Let's go inside.

192
00:10:18,915 --> 00:10:21,584
What? What's this? Did you catch the bouquet?

193
00:10:23,584 --> 00:10:26,254
Woo Ri, you'll be married in six months then.

194
00:10:26,255 --> 00:10:27,655
That's great news.

195
00:10:27,724 --> 00:10:31,424
I've been waiting for you and Kang Jae to bring up marriage.

196
00:10:31,665 --> 00:10:34,034
How come you guys aren't talking about marriage?

197
00:10:34,035 --> 00:10:35,463
What did he say after he saw the bouquet?

198
00:10:35,464 --> 00:10:37,165
Not much.

199
00:10:37,635 --> 00:10:39,174
I told him it wasn't a bouquet.

200
00:10:39,704 --> 00:10:42,073
Do you feel uncomfortable bringing up marriage first?

201
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:43,775
Come on, there's no more of that gender role.

202
00:10:43,974 --> 00:10:46,213
Forget it. Call him to come over. I'll talk to him.

203
00:10:46,214 --> 00:10:48,073
What? Why would you do that?

204
00:10:48,074 --> 00:10:49,944
I need to have a heart-to-heart with your boyfriend.

205
00:10:50,214 --> 00:10:52,655
He's been waiting for two years. That's enough patience.

206
00:10:54,385 --> 00:10:56,453
Or is there something wrong with him? He can't get it up?

207
00:10:56,454 --> 00:10:58,293
- Come on. - Watch your mouth.

208
00:10:58,294 --> 00:10:59,924
Forget what she said.

209
00:10:59,995 --> 00:11:03,563
I would love to see my granddaughter marry a man like him.

210
00:11:03,564 --> 00:11:05,535
Marriage is...

211
00:11:08,905 --> 00:11:11,265
Wait. Isn't it time? Right?

212
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:15,043
- She never finishes... - Gosh. Let her be.

213
00:11:15,044 --> 00:11:16,375
What are you talking about?

214
00:11:21,615 --> 00:11:22,745
Turn on the TV.

215
00:11:23,544 --> 00:11:25,515
("Mask of Desire")

216
00:11:25,584 --> 00:11:27,553
Will he find out today?

217
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:29,384
I can't wait until Choi Seoung Il finds out.

218
00:11:29,385 --> 00:11:30,784
No spoilers, Woo Ri.

219
00:11:30,785 --> 00:11:33,823
Gosh. My granddaughter is the writer of "Mask of Desire".

220
00:11:33,824 --> 00:11:35,794
I'm going to brag about you to people.

221
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:36,923
I'm just an assistant.

222
00:11:36,924 --> 00:11:39,234
An assistant and the main writer aren't the same at all.

223
00:11:39,235 --> 00:11:40,634
They are the same thing in my eyes.

224
00:11:40,635 --> 00:11:42,605
Gosh. They aren't the same thing at all.

225
00:11:43,265 --> 00:11:44,635
There he is!

226
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:48,604
- Goodness. Oh, my. - Gosh.

227
00:11:48,605 --> 00:11:49,704
Sir.

228
00:11:51,005 --> 00:11:52,115
It's...

229
00:11:54,415 --> 00:11:55,485
Shush.

230
00:11:58,615 --> 00:12:00,714
Gosh. How is he so handsome?

231
00:12:03,255 --> 00:12:04,684
That's it. I can't stop it.

232
00:12:06,355 --> 00:12:09,265
Goodness. Thank you.

233
00:12:10,665 --> 00:12:11,693
What's this?

234
00:12:11,694 --> 00:12:12,963
(Choi Seoung Il is lying to us. He's not 39. He's 45.)

235
00:12:12,964 --> 00:12:15,035
Seriously. These haters online.

236
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:17,563
They are always slandering Seoung Il.

237
00:12:17,564 --> 00:12:19,034
(His real name is Choi Duk Chil.)

238
00:12:19,035 --> 00:12:20,275
"Choi Duk Chil"?

239
00:12:21,105 --> 00:12:22,374
What a familiar name.

240
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:24,645
(Choi Duk Chil)

241
00:12:31,954 --> 00:12:33,115
Duk Chil?

242
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:01,015
What were you looking at? Why do you look so surprised?

243
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:02,944
Don't you knock?

244
00:13:03,344 --> 00:13:05,584
Mom, I told you not to wear my clothes.

245
00:13:07,285 --> 00:13:08,785
And stop checking out weird videos. Go to sleep.

246
00:13:14,224 --> 00:13:16,324
Seriously. How could she be watching porn?

247
00:13:23,865 --> 00:13:25,433
What? You answered right away.

248
00:13:25,434 --> 00:13:27,734
- I should answer your calls... - What do we do now?

249
00:13:27,735 --> 00:13:29,544
like they are emergency calls.

250
00:13:29,745 --> 00:13:32,973
- What is it? - No. It's nothing.

251
00:13:32,974 --> 00:13:34,145
What's going on?

252
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:37,245
Kang Jae.

253
00:13:38,855 --> 00:13:40,985
Should we just...

254
00:13:43,285 --> 00:13:44,355
do it?

255
00:13:45,094 --> 00:13:47,755
Sorry, Woo Ri. I didn't hear you.

256
00:13:49,895 --> 00:13:53,093
No, nothing. Sleep tight.

257
00:13:53,094 --> 00:13:54,135
Okay.

258
00:13:54,995 --> 00:13:56,634
Sleep tight. I'll call you tomorrow.

259
00:13:56,635 --> 00:13:57,735
Okay.

260
00:14:04,304 --> 00:14:06,574
Come on. I told you to be quiet.

261
00:14:08,915 --> 00:14:11,145
Detective Lee.

262
00:14:11,245 --> 00:14:13,155
Why don't we talk it out without any handcuffs?

263
00:14:25,495 --> 00:14:27,334
("Mask of Desire")

264
00:14:34,235 --> 00:14:36,005
Shouldn't...

265
00:14:36,505 --> 00:14:39,044
Chun Sa Da be a bit manlier in this scene?

266
00:14:39,544 --> 00:14:40,615
Sure.

267
00:14:41,015 --> 00:14:43,615
But the next scene will really showcase his charms.

268
00:14:43,844 --> 00:14:45,784
Ji Dok Sa is trying to get revenge on Na Beom In...

269
00:14:45,785 --> 00:14:46,954
That doesn't sound interesting.

270
00:14:47,415 --> 00:14:49,054
I see. It doesn't sound interesting.

271
00:14:49,385 --> 00:14:51,255
Sa Da isn't doing anything.

272
00:14:51,824 --> 00:14:52,924
Sir.

273
00:14:53,355 --> 00:14:56,124
The writer wanted to showcase...

274
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:59,464
Ji Dok Sa's charms in this scene.

275
00:14:59,665 --> 00:15:03,035
But you want this scene to be more entertaining.

276
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:06,735
In that case, why doesn't she dominate the scene a bit more?

277
00:15:07,074 --> 00:15:08,504
Dominate the scene? How?

278
00:15:08,505 --> 00:15:12,015
Instead of showing her interest,

279
00:15:12,214 --> 00:15:13,673
she can flat-out seduce him.

280
00:15:13,674 --> 00:15:15,015
Seduce him? How?

281
00:15:15,344 --> 00:15:18,415
Well, I guess...

282
00:15:18,755 --> 00:15:22,223
she can push Na Beom In onto the sofa, so he's on his back.

283
00:15:22,224 --> 00:15:24,485
He's on his back. I like it. What next?

284
00:15:25,294 --> 00:15:26,424
When he's lying on his back,

285
00:15:28,324 --> 00:15:31,395
she can rip open his button-up shirt.

286
00:15:32,194 --> 00:15:35,865
Then she can caress his hard chest with her long fingertips.

287
00:15:36,605 --> 00:15:39,134
The moment their eyes lock, they can start kissing.

288
00:15:39,135 --> 00:15:41,904
They are French kissing each other so passionately.

289
00:15:41,905 --> 00:15:44,043
Then they head over to the bed. And their hands are...

290
00:15:44,044 --> 00:15:46,774
all over each other, caressing and touching each other's body.

291
00:15:46,775 --> 00:15:50,145
And the room is filled with their heavy breathing.

292
00:15:50,314 --> 00:15:52,054
Then they start to lose their minds...

293
00:15:54,054 --> 00:15:55,584
How about something like this?

294
00:15:55,684 --> 00:15:57,553
I see. That's great.

295
00:15:57,554 --> 00:15:59,053
Dial it down a notch to pass the censorship.

296
00:15:59,054 --> 00:16:00,193
She'll seduce him then.

297
00:16:00,194 --> 00:16:03,293
- Are you okay with that? - Yes. I'll revise the script then.

298
00:16:03,294 --> 00:16:05,094
- Hey! - You!

299
00:16:06,635 --> 00:16:07,794
Stop right there!

300
00:16:09,735 --> 00:16:10,905
Hey, Grizzly Bear.

301
00:16:11,035 --> 00:16:13,605
Look. You have nowhere to go now. Right?

302
00:16:14,304 --> 00:16:15,474
Hey.

303
00:16:15,905 --> 00:16:17,504
You little... Hey, get him.

304
00:16:17,505 --> 00:16:18,615
Hey!

305
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,615
How dare you swing a metal pipe at cops?

306
00:16:26,985 --> 00:16:29,125
Hey! Are you okay?

307
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:32,794
- I'm fine. - Not you. Is Grizzly Bear okay?

308
00:16:33,395 --> 00:16:34,424
What?

309
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:37,563
No, she told me they were just regular flowers.

310
00:16:37,564 --> 00:16:39,793
Gosh. How could you be so clueless?

311
00:16:39,794 --> 00:16:41,494
When a girl brings flowers from a wedding,

312
00:16:41,495 --> 00:16:42,803
it means she caught the bridal bouquet.

313
00:16:42,804 --> 00:16:46,073
Gosh. That's odd. Why didn't she say she caught it?

314
00:16:46,074 --> 00:16:49,874
Kang Jae. It might be uncomfortable for her to bring up marriage first.

315
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,073
Hold on.

316
00:16:51,074 --> 00:16:53,474
Doesn't it mean she has to get married within six months?

317
00:16:54,344 --> 00:16:55,784
Hey. Isn't that what people say?

318
00:16:55,785 --> 00:16:57,385
Senior Officer Lee.

319
00:16:58,485 --> 00:17:01,285
Being the best detective doesn't mean he's the best boyfriend.

320
00:17:01,515 --> 00:17:03,923
Our second anniversary is soon. Should I propose then?

321
00:17:03,924 --> 00:17:05,394
Don't you want to get married?

322
00:17:05,395 --> 00:17:06,793
I said I would propose to her.

323
00:17:06,794 --> 00:17:08,824
When a man decides something, you ought to do it right away.

324
00:17:08,825 --> 00:17:10,694
Why would you wait two years?

325
00:17:15,605 --> 00:17:17,934
Hey, how long have you been working?

326
00:17:18,605 --> 00:17:19,635
Five years.

327
00:17:20,504 --> 00:17:24,545
We were both assistants together for "Seduction Like the Night Mist".

328
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:25,845
Five years.

329
00:17:26,174 --> 00:17:28,645
But in front of Director Park...

330
00:17:31,585 --> 00:17:33,154
What are you going to do now?

331
00:17:33,155 --> 00:17:34,454
What do you mean?

332
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:40,094
Abstaining from sex? Fine. You can do it.

333
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:42,194
I can understand your belief.

334
00:17:42,295 --> 00:17:44,624
But your body doesn't understand you.

335
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:46,533
Your suppressed subconscious...

336
00:17:46,534 --> 00:17:48,703
is going off right now.

337
00:17:48,704 --> 00:17:51,904
That's why you rambled on in front of Director Park earlier.

338
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:53,904
I'm really sorry.

339
00:17:53,905 --> 00:17:55,944
Why are you sorry? For being a virgin?

340
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:00,714
Woo Ri. I'm not scolding you right now.

341
00:18:01,014 --> 00:18:03,845
I've watched you every day for the past five years.

342
00:18:04,315 --> 00:18:05,915
I'm just worried about you.

343
00:18:06,784 --> 00:18:09,055
Please! Just get married already!

344
00:18:10,484 --> 00:18:11,524
Ye Ri.

345
00:18:12,795 --> 00:18:15,795
How come I don't feel sure about marrying Kang Jae?

346
00:18:16,694 --> 00:18:17,895
He's perfect.

347
00:18:18,065 --> 00:18:20,734
But there's just one thing that's missing.

348
00:18:21,034 --> 00:18:22,734
You didn't do one thing.

349
00:18:23,805 --> 00:18:24,905
Sex.

350
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,374
Gosh.

351
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:28,904
My gosh. Hey.

352
00:18:28,905 --> 00:18:31,673
Living a life of abstinence is like fighting in a war.

353
00:18:31,674 --> 00:18:33,673
Your life can't be peaceful.

354
00:18:33,674 --> 00:18:35,884
Has there been a guy who understood your belief?

355
00:18:35,885 --> 00:18:37,243
Kang Jae is like a unicorn!

356
00:18:37,244 --> 00:18:38,754
Grab him and get on already.

357
00:18:39,155 --> 00:18:41,415
He'll be your first and last.

358
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:45,355
You will share all of your firsts with him.

359
00:18:47,024 --> 00:18:48,254
Gosh.

360
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:51,395
What is it? Why the sigh all of a sudden?

361
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:55,065
He would've been my first for everything if I didn't kiss him.

362
00:18:55,764 --> 00:18:56,964
Gosh, you.

363
00:18:57,835 --> 00:19:00,534
Kang Jae wasn't your first kiss? You kissed another guy?

364
00:19:01,274 --> 00:19:02,375
Who?

365
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:03,264
What is this?

366
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:05,734
Who on earth plays this kind of music at a hospital?

367
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:07,504
This song...

368
00:20:08,174 --> 00:20:10,344
- Hey, you need to hide. - What?

369
00:20:10,345 --> 00:20:11,874
- Hide now! Quickly. - Why?

370
00:20:11,875 --> 00:20:14,273
- No. Just get out. - What's gotten into you?

371
00:20:14,274 --> 00:20:17,045
This is an emergency! Get out!

372
00:20:24,855 --> 00:20:25,954
Honey.

373
00:20:31,724 --> 00:20:32,964
What are you doing?

374
00:20:33,095 --> 00:20:34,595
You should be in the hospital.

375
00:20:42,105 --> 00:20:43,105
(Doctor's Note)

376
00:20:43,106 --> 00:20:44,144
(He completed chemotherapy...)

377
00:20:44,145 --> 00:20:47,545
All the cancer cells are gone. So your stomach cancer is cured?

378
00:20:48,444 --> 00:20:50,415
Why didn't you tell me?

379
00:20:51,845 --> 00:20:52,915
Surprise.

380
00:20:54,514 --> 00:20:56,024
Honey.

381
00:20:59,454 --> 00:21:01,424
Oh, and this.

382
00:21:01,795 --> 00:21:03,764
- This is your present. - A present?

383
00:21:11,464 --> 00:21:13,335
(Consensual Divorce Intention Confirmation Document)

384
00:21:18,974 --> 00:21:21,415
- We're late. - Gosh, we're late.

385
00:21:21,545 --> 00:21:24,283
- We're late. - Oh gosh.

386
00:21:24,284 --> 00:21:26,014
Hold it.

387
00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:27,254
We need to get on that elevator.

388
00:21:33,655 --> 00:21:35,665
No, it's not there.

389
00:21:35,764 --> 00:21:37,825
Gosh, what do I do with that girl?

390
00:21:42,764 --> 00:21:44,365
- It's enormous. - Hey.

391
00:21:44,605 --> 00:21:46,804
You've never been to the Diamond Medical Foundation,

392
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:47,934
the largest in Gangnam?

393
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:49,045
No.

394
00:21:49,444 --> 00:21:50,944
This is great.

395
00:21:51,575 --> 00:21:54,074
No, this isn't our problem now. We've got a meeting to attend.

396
00:21:54,075 --> 00:21:55,815
We have a meeting.

397
00:21:57,484 --> 00:21:58,954
It's been a long time everyone.

398
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:02,654
Long time no see.

399
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:03,824
It's been long, hasn't it?

400
00:22:03,825 --> 00:22:04,924
It's good to see you.

401
00:22:05,524 --> 00:22:07,095
We're happy that you're back.

402
00:22:20,704 --> 00:22:22,544
Please sit.

403
00:22:22,545 --> 00:22:24,605
- Are you feeling better? - Yes, of course.

404
00:22:25,004 --> 00:22:26,214
Greetings.

405
00:22:26,474 --> 00:22:28,845
Good to see you. Please, pass that on.

406
00:22:29,585 --> 00:22:30,744
Okay.

407
00:22:32,514 --> 00:22:36,324
I'm Raphael, the CEO of Diamond Cosmetics,

408
00:22:36,325 --> 00:22:37,555
who came back to work today.

409
00:22:38,424 --> 00:22:41,554
Although our hospital is the main shooting location,

410
00:22:41,555 --> 00:22:44,564
the main PPL sponsor is us...

411
00:22:44,565 --> 00:22:45,865
- Yes? - What?

412
00:22:49,204 --> 00:22:51,234
Yes, it's our cosmetics company.

413
00:22:52,835 --> 00:22:56,973
So, from now on I will especially...

414
00:22:56,974 --> 00:22:58,744
take charge of...

415
00:22:59,815 --> 00:23:03,045
the meetings related to...

416
00:23:03,214 --> 00:23:05,284
Is there something on the floor?

417
00:23:07,355 --> 00:23:08,483
What is it?

418
00:23:08,484 --> 00:23:09,984
What are you doing?

419
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:18,165
I know very well...

420
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:23,635
that Diamond Cosmetics has the image of...

421
00:23:24,365 --> 00:23:25,504
tagging along to...

422
00:23:26,135 --> 00:23:27,204
Diamond Medical Foundation.

423
00:23:27,375 --> 00:23:29,674
I know this, but I'm going to change that.

424
00:23:30,545 --> 00:23:32,545
Soon...

425
00:23:33,315 --> 00:23:36,615
we're going to open a re-launching event.

426
00:23:37,214 --> 00:23:39,453
We will invite parties from the media, medical foundation,

427
00:23:39,454 --> 00:23:41,713
and VIPs...

428
00:23:41,714 --> 00:23:43,953
to show that our cosmetics are no longer...

429
00:23:43,954 --> 00:23:45,085
Come on.

430
00:23:47,024 --> 00:23:48,595
Good work everyone.

431
00:23:48,694 --> 00:23:50,365
Gosh, that was annoying.

432
00:23:53,034 --> 00:23:54,334
Ms. Yu?

433
00:23:54,335 --> 00:23:55,934
Yes?

434
00:24:10,145 --> 00:24:11,415
Excuse me.

435
00:24:12,655 --> 00:24:14,885
We've met somewhere before, haven't we?

436
00:24:19,095 --> 00:24:20,325
Yes?

437
00:24:21,954 --> 00:24:23,763
Was it at Cheongdam Lounge?

438
00:24:23,764 --> 00:24:25,095
Or at Sinsa Club?

439
00:24:25,194 --> 00:24:26,365
Excuse me?

440
00:24:27,135 --> 00:24:28,665
Maybe it wasn't a club.

441
00:24:29,704 --> 00:24:31,105
- Karaoke? - Darn it.

442
00:24:32,835 --> 00:24:34,335
- Sir? - Yes?

443
00:24:35,845 --> 00:24:38,105
Why did you join the meeting all of a sudden like that?

444
00:24:38,204 --> 00:24:39,513
It was the first time meeting the CEO today.

445
00:24:39,514 --> 00:24:40,674
Isn't he handsome?

446
00:24:40,815 --> 00:24:42,815
Should I call it, "sexiness that calls for a kiss"?

447
00:24:46,514 --> 00:24:48,484
What? What is it?

448
00:24:50,424 --> 00:24:51,954
Kiss...

449
00:24:52,125 --> 00:24:54,355
Hey, what is it?

450
00:24:55,295 --> 00:24:57,095
Why are you angry suddenly?

451
00:24:57,795 --> 00:24:58,994
Bend your knees.

452
00:24:59,964 --> 00:25:01,234
- Relax your shoulders. - Okay.

453
00:25:01,264 --> 00:25:02,434
And like a clock pendulum.

454
00:25:05,565 --> 00:25:07,004
Nice.

455
00:25:10,345 --> 00:25:11,545
Mr. Lee,

456
00:25:11,875 --> 00:25:13,315
Mr. Raphael is here.

457
00:25:13,545 --> 00:25:15,374
You jerk, what are you doing?

458
00:25:15,375 --> 00:25:16,414
Gosh.

459
00:25:16,415 --> 00:25:19,055
You're swearing at me as soon as you see me.

460
00:25:19,355 --> 00:25:22,085
Shouldn't you be happy that your son came back alive?

461
00:25:22,184 --> 00:25:23,454
Is he your son?

462
00:25:24,585 --> 00:25:27,024
Get to the car and wait. I'll be there soon.

463
00:25:31,924 --> 00:25:35,065
You should've told me if your treatment was going well.

464
00:25:37,065 --> 00:25:38,234
Surprise.

465
00:25:39,004 --> 00:25:40,105
Hey, you!

466
00:25:40,674 --> 00:25:43,075
I didn't send you to study abroad to play word games with me.

467
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:46,145
You should report everything that is happening.

468
00:25:46,415 --> 00:25:47,645
My gosh.

469
00:25:53,014 --> 00:25:55,055
I heard you told Dr. Jang to keep your recovery a secret.

470
00:25:56,355 --> 00:25:57,555
What are you up to?

471
00:25:58,024 --> 00:25:59,555
It's not like that.

472
00:26:00,224 --> 00:26:02,894
It feels like I earned a bonus life,

473
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:04,764
so I'm thinking about...

474
00:26:05,895 --> 00:26:07,095
what I can do to do enjoy life even more.

475
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:10,064
What made you go to the meeting as soon as you returned?

476
00:26:10,065 --> 00:26:11,264
So that I can do proper work.

477
00:26:11,434 --> 00:26:14,033
Since I got my new title, I got to earn my keep.

478
00:26:14,034 --> 00:26:15,204
Cosmetics...

479
00:26:16,504 --> 00:26:17,805
What's left from selling them?

480
00:26:18,004 --> 00:26:19,414
You need to expand the hospitals.

481
00:26:19,415 --> 00:26:22,315
Plastic surgery, dermatology, dentistry, and ENT clinics.

482
00:26:23,645 --> 00:26:26,355
I opened a new nursing home while you were gone.

483
00:26:27,355 --> 00:26:29,055
Come and take charge of the hospital.

484
00:26:29,954 --> 00:26:31,625
You're my only son.

485
00:26:32,494 --> 00:26:34,124
You should come and train for management.

486
00:26:34,125 --> 00:26:35,295
Gosh, no.

487
00:26:35,724 --> 00:26:39,395
You're too young with all those young girlfriends.

488
00:26:39,494 --> 00:26:40,994
When would I inherit the hospital?

489
00:26:41,434 --> 00:26:43,135
I'll just work on the cosmetics company.

490
00:26:46,734 --> 00:26:48,905
You never listen to me, do you?

491
00:26:50,575 --> 00:26:51,575
By the way,

492
00:26:52,674 --> 00:26:55,345
Ma Ri called crying. What's that about?

493
00:26:55,674 --> 00:26:56,845
Divorce?

494
00:26:58,714 --> 00:27:00,554
I'll take care of my business.

495
00:27:00,555 --> 00:27:02,085
That's not your business but the family's.

496
00:27:03,155 --> 00:27:04,355
What's the reason?

497
00:27:09,924 --> 00:27:11,463
You know my sperm...

498
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:12,894
The ones you had frozen when doing your chemotherapy?

499
00:27:12,895 --> 00:27:14,464
I only have one left.

500
00:27:14,964 --> 00:27:17,433
I only have one chance...

501
00:27:17,434 --> 00:27:18,605
to make a baby.

502
00:27:19,534 --> 00:27:23,575
With that thought...

503
00:27:24,004 --> 00:27:27,345
I thought that there will be...

504
00:27:28,915 --> 00:27:30,145
someone connected by fate.

505
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:31,885
But...

506
00:27:32,754 --> 00:27:34,585
that person is not Ma Ri.

507
00:27:35,684 --> 00:27:37,325
What fate?

508
00:27:37,784 --> 00:27:39,394
Get your head out of the clouds.

509
00:27:39,395 --> 00:27:42,055
Just tell me what the problem is.

510
00:27:42,194 --> 00:27:43,824
Hello, Ms. Lee.

511
00:27:43,825 --> 00:27:45,224
Hello.

512
00:27:53,204 --> 00:27:55,805
Darn it! What a day!

513
00:28:01,815 --> 00:28:03,845
Gosh. What is this?

514
00:28:04,585 --> 00:28:05,814
Mister!

515
00:28:05,815 --> 00:28:07,954
Just call the insurance company. Have them take care of it.

516
00:28:08,254 --> 00:28:10,684
If you crashed into the car, you should apologize first...

517
00:28:19,565 --> 00:28:20,795
All right.

518
00:28:35,274 --> 00:28:36,514
What's this?

519
00:28:37,315 --> 00:28:38,584
She just left.

520
00:28:38,585 --> 00:28:39,754
Yes.

521
00:28:40,454 --> 00:28:42,085
The car looks fine, so.

522
00:28:43,585 --> 00:28:44,754
This?

523
00:28:45,684 --> 00:28:46,694
Is this fine?

524
00:29:15,784 --> 00:29:19,694
So he requested a divorce out of the blue?

525
00:29:25,994 --> 00:29:27,434
Did you tell him anything?

526
00:29:28,994 --> 00:29:31,135
Or did you just stay still and listened?

527
00:29:33,174 --> 00:29:34,335
Princess...

528
00:29:34,375 --> 00:29:36,274
stop biting on your nails!

529
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:38,274
What did you get caught in?

530
00:29:39,145 --> 00:29:40,614
Did you get caught for marriage fraud?

531
00:29:40,615 --> 00:29:42,815
Conning him into marriage because you told him you were pregnant?

532
00:29:42,915 --> 00:29:43,983
No.

533
00:29:43,984 --> 00:29:45,144
Then,

534
00:29:45,145 --> 00:29:47,484
for telling him you went to Sweden and falsifying your education?

535
00:29:47,754 --> 00:29:50,885
Or for changing your name to change your identity? Is that it?

536
00:29:51,284 --> 00:29:52,423
No, that's not it!

537
00:29:52,424 --> 00:29:55,224
You...

538
00:29:56,365 --> 00:29:58,764
You got caught fooling around with that male escort, didn't you?

539
00:29:59,024 --> 00:30:01,734
I didn't get caught. It's not that either.

540
00:30:03,105 --> 00:30:04,264
Then, what is it?

541
00:30:04,835 --> 00:30:06,934
I think he doesn't like me after he recovered from cancer.

542
00:30:07,474 --> 00:30:08,635
No, wait...

543
00:30:09,135 --> 00:30:11,943
He got forced into marrying someone he already hated,

544
00:30:11,944 --> 00:30:14,315
and now that he came back from the dead, he must hate me even more.

545
00:30:17,284 --> 00:30:20,184
I really like Raphael.

546
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:24,284
How do I change his mind?

547
00:30:25,125 --> 00:30:27,155
Don't think.

548
00:30:27,595 --> 00:30:29,193
I'll do the thinking for you.

549
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:31,194
Are there any good ideas?

550
00:30:31,295 --> 00:30:32,565
Go to the hospital tomorrow...

551
00:30:32,994 --> 00:30:35,964
and get artificial insemination done with Raphael's sperm.

552
00:30:36,605 --> 00:30:37,805
What?

553
00:30:38,135 --> 00:30:39,704
Don't I need Raphael's consent for that?

554
00:30:39,805 --> 00:30:42,845
He only has one that he froze before his chemotherapy.

555
00:30:43,645 --> 00:30:45,474
It wasn't cheap.

556
00:30:48,214 --> 00:30:49,815
Pregnancy will secure the deal.

557
00:30:50,315 --> 00:30:51,984
He won't be able to do anything.

558
00:30:53,984 --> 00:30:55,854
Mom, I think you're a genius.

559
00:30:55,855 --> 00:30:57,724
You're the greatest!

560
00:31:14,075 --> 00:31:15,605
- Come on! - Turn the music back on!

561
00:31:16,204 --> 00:31:17,443
Why?

562
00:31:17,444 --> 00:31:18,605
Why did you turn off the music?

563
00:31:20,575 --> 00:31:21,974
Isn't this Raphael's song?

564
00:31:32,424 --> 00:31:35,993
- Raphael! - Raphael!

565
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:39,693
- Raphael! - Raphael!

566
00:31:39,694 --> 00:31:43,204
- Raphael! - Raphael!

567
00:31:45,305 --> 00:31:46,574
Yes!

568
00:31:46,575 --> 00:31:49,404
I missed you so much.

569
00:31:49,405 --> 00:31:51,904
What do you mean? I missed you more.

570
00:31:51,905 --> 00:31:54,045
Raphael, are you better now?

571
00:31:54,415 --> 00:31:57,084
Yes, I came back after killing all the cancer cells.

572
00:31:57,085 --> 00:31:58,815
I'll pay for all the drinks here tonight!

573
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:02,855
You've never met Mi Ae, have you?

574
00:32:03,484 --> 00:32:05,325
Say hello. This is Raphael.

575
00:32:07,125 --> 00:32:08,325
Hello.

576
00:32:09,095 --> 00:32:12,124
"Mask of Desire"?

577
00:32:12,125 --> 00:32:13,493
Are you the actress, Choi Mi Ae?

578
00:32:13,494 --> 00:32:15,295
We're sponsoring that drama.

579
00:32:15,395 --> 00:32:18,135
I watched all the episodes without missing out.

580
00:32:18,234 --> 00:32:19,905
I'm a fan. Nice to meet you.

581
00:32:21,934 --> 00:32:23,075
Nice to meet you too.

582
00:32:27,944 --> 00:32:30,115
Mother, who I thought passed away...

583
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:33,254
is alive.

584
00:32:33,615 --> 00:32:35,684
It's fortunate that we found out now.

585
00:32:37,754 --> 00:32:39,624
- Then, I should... - I'm sorry.

586
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:41,523
- I thought no one was in here. - It's okay.

587
00:32:41,524 --> 00:32:42,555
You can continue with your work.

588
00:32:43,665 --> 00:32:45,365
How's your condition?

589
00:32:47,734 --> 00:32:49,065
I don't sleep well.

590
00:32:49,934 --> 00:32:52,434
I didn't know you watched this.

591
00:32:52,665 --> 00:32:54,234
I like this show too.

592
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:56,773
You can watch it with me. You can work after.

593
00:32:56,774 --> 00:33:00,345
No. I have that much sense, you know.

594
00:33:00,845 --> 00:33:02,845
You're watching this for work.

595
00:33:03,385 --> 00:33:05,384
No, I'm watching this for fun.

596
00:33:05,385 --> 00:33:06,815
Please, have a seat.

597
00:33:07,454 --> 00:33:09,554
I think Choi Seoung Il will help Dok Sa soon.

598
00:33:09,555 --> 00:33:11,885
What? Really?

599
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:15,453
My sister's beautiful looks...

600
00:33:15,454 --> 00:33:19,395
Young people these days, don't watch dramas anymore.

601
00:33:20,194 --> 00:33:23,105
I used to watch it with my mom when I was young.

602
00:33:23,805 --> 00:33:25,135
So, it's fun for me.

603
00:33:25,405 --> 00:33:26,504
Right.

604
00:33:27,575 --> 00:33:30,474
A day passes quickly...

605
00:33:30,645 --> 00:33:32,875
waiting for the next day's show.

606
00:33:33,244 --> 00:33:35,014
Yes, that's why I watch it too.

607
00:33:35,944 --> 00:33:37,014
Excuse me?

608
00:33:38,345 --> 00:33:41,284
You know, I was sick to death.

609
00:33:42,155 --> 00:33:45,183
But while watching the dramas,

610
00:33:45,184 --> 00:33:48,795
I couldn't die because I was curious about what would happen next.

611
00:34:08,315 --> 00:34:12,344
("Mask of Desire")

612
00:34:42,675 --> 00:34:44,114
I'm back.

613
00:34:45,315 --> 00:34:46,883
Go and get some rest.

614
00:34:46,884 --> 00:34:47,985
Yes.

615
00:34:50,324 --> 00:34:51,654
Grandma, something smells like burning.

616
00:34:56,224 --> 00:34:57,364
Gosh, Grandma.

617
00:34:59,165 --> 00:35:00,464
Are you crying?

618
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:01,835
Your mom...

619
00:35:02,494 --> 00:35:05,304
That producer man who promised to make her a singer...

620
00:35:06,005 --> 00:35:08,934
took a private loan under your mother's name and disappeared.

621
00:35:09,404 --> 00:35:11,605
- What? - It's a private loan.

622
00:35:11,675 --> 00:35:13,244
If you don't pay back...

623
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:15,974
the interest becomes larger than the principal.

624
00:35:26,125 --> 00:35:27,295
Mom.

625
00:35:28,025 --> 00:35:30,025
- What? - Seriously...

626
00:35:30,824 --> 00:35:32,824
why do you live like that?

627
00:35:33,665 --> 00:35:35,093
Grandma's crying because of you.

628
00:35:35,094 --> 00:35:36,504
Do you have to become a singer?

629
00:35:36,505 --> 00:35:38,465
- Because of that Grandma... - Woo Ri.

630
00:35:39,775 --> 00:35:41,875
Telling me not to become a singer...

631
00:35:43,244 --> 00:35:45,404
is not living as Oh Eun Ran, who didn't become a singer.

632
00:35:46,574 --> 00:35:48,315
It means I can't live as Oh Eun Ran at all.

633
00:36:08,895 --> 00:36:11,005
Stop crying.

634
00:36:11,065 --> 00:36:13,005
It's not a big deal.

635
00:36:13,235 --> 00:36:15,534
You can look for another company.

636
00:36:16,105 --> 00:36:19,375
They won't let a single mom become a singer.

637
00:36:19,715 --> 00:36:23,784
Entertainment companies won't take a woman who had a child at sixteen.

638
00:36:24,244 --> 00:36:27,985
Gosh, stop crying.

639
00:36:28,915 --> 00:36:29,954
Mom.

640
00:36:31,284 --> 00:36:32,454
If...

641
00:36:34,324 --> 00:36:36,324
I didn't have Woo Ri back then...

642
00:36:37,625 --> 00:36:39,565
If I didn't...

643
00:36:43,235 --> 00:36:46,065
Gosh.

644
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:48,804
(Pledge of Purity)

645
00:36:50,545 --> 00:36:56,645
(Oh Woo Ri)

646
00:36:56,915 --> 00:36:59,815
(Pledge of Purity)

647
00:37:05,954 --> 00:37:07,054
Woo Ri.

648
00:37:07,355 --> 00:37:08,855
Kang Jae.

649
00:37:10,165 --> 00:37:11,724
What's wrong?

650
00:37:14,594 --> 00:37:17,735
Mom got swindled out of money.

651
00:37:17,864 --> 00:37:20,804
Is she okay?

652
00:37:21,074 --> 00:37:22,335
How much? By whom?

653
00:37:22,835 --> 00:37:24,204
Her new boyfriend.

654
00:37:27,875 --> 00:37:29,944
I don't know why she lives like that.

655
00:37:29,945 --> 00:37:31,045
Gosh.

656
00:37:32,545 --> 00:37:34,755
I'll look into it and take care of it. Don't worry about it.

657
00:37:35,085 --> 00:37:36,925
Are you okay?

658
00:37:39,585 --> 00:37:40,925
I'm sorry, Kang Jae.

659
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:44,264
Thank you.

660
00:37:45,165 --> 00:37:46,594
Gosh, no.

661
00:37:47,295 --> 00:37:48,835
What is it between the two?

662
00:37:49,034 --> 00:37:50,304
Thank you...

663
00:37:51,105 --> 00:37:52,704
for liking someone like me.

664
00:37:52,904 --> 00:37:55,134
What? What's wrong with you?

665
00:37:55,634 --> 00:37:57,275
What's wrong with you?

666
00:37:58,404 --> 00:38:00,045
You're the best for me.

667
00:38:02,344 --> 00:38:04,844
I'm a fool for worrying about it.

668
00:38:06,215 --> 00:38:07,784
Worry about what?

669
00:38:08,184 --> 00:38:09,215
What?

670
00:38:10,125 --> 00:38:11,324
It's nothing.

671
00:38:17,565 --> 00:38:18,625
Kang Jae.

672
00:38:19,934 --> 00:38:23,764
We've dated for two years now...

673
00:38:25,904 --> 00:38:28,874
and that bouquet I got at the wedding earlier...

674
00:38:28,875 --> 00:38:31,744
- It's actually... - Wait.

675
00:38:33,675 --> 00:38:37,085
If your girlfriend brings up marriage first,

676
00:38:37,184 --> 00:38:38,814
you'll regret it for life.

677
00:38:38,815 --> 00:38:40,683
A man should...

678
00:38:40,684 --> 00:38:42,954
propose first.

679
00:38:47,054 --> 00:38:50,723
Woo Ri, we should get going now.

680
00:38:50,724 --> 00:38:53,933
I'll call Mother and take care of it.

681
00:38:53,934 --> 00:38:55,734
We should go now. Your mother will be worried.

682
00:38:55,735 --> 00:38:56,904
Let's go.

683
00:38:57,105 --> 00:38:59,504
She won't be worried.

684
00:38:59,505 --> 00:39:01,504
- No. - Come on, let's go.

685
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:04,145
- Mother will be worried. - How could you?

686
00:39:04,304 --> 00:39:06,645
How could you let her go when the car is dented like that?

687
00:39:06,775 --> 00:39:08,445
Will you stop about that?

688
00:39:09,545 --> 00:39:12,784
Hey, would you have let her go if she was a man?

689
00:39:12,985 --> 00:39:15,585
I know how you fall for young women like that.

690
00:39:15,815 --> 00:39:18,125
You've been saying the same thing all day today.

691
00:39:18,454 --> 00:39:20,453
Do you know how obsessive you are?

692
00:39:20,454 --> 00:39:23,093
- What? - I'm tired of you being this way.

693
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:25,194
- What now? - Let's break up!

694
00:39:25,195 --> 00:39:27,133
This is over. Over! Darn it.

695
00:39:27,134 --> 00:39:28,764
You're breaking up with me?

696
00:39:28,965 --> 00:39:31,204
How can you tell me that you want to break up?

697
00:39:31,335 --> 00:39:33,235
Come back!

698
00:39:33,375 --> 00:39:34,704
Come back!

699
00:39:38,045 --> 00:39:39,573
I'll pay back the loan.

700
00:39:39,574 --> 00:39:42,145
So, forget about recording an album and becoming a singer.

701
00:39:42,715 --> 00:39:43,944
I'm going to get the money.

702
00:39:43,945 --> 00:39:46,144
Just drop it, will you?

703
00:39:46,145 --> 00:39:48,553
Just stay being a singing teacher at the singing school.

704
00:39:48,554 --> 00:39:49,754
Do it as your hobby.

705
00:39:49,755 --> 00:39:50,954
Mom.

706
00:39:51,184 --> 00:39:53,153
I was picked out off the street in grade 8...

707
00:39:53,154 --> 00:39:54,553
and was preparing to become a member of a girl group.

708
00:39:54,554 --> 00:39:56,553
I'd be Lee Hyori if I debuted back then.

709
00:39:56,554 --> 00:40:00,634
Yes, that is if you didn't get pregnant back then.

710
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,933
You didn't become Lee Hyori.

711
00:40:02,934 --> 00:40:05,105
How long are you going to hold onto that thought?

712
00:40:05,465 --> 00:40:07,404
You'll only live if you stop.

713
00:40:08,304 --> 00:40:09,605
I can't live if I don't.

714
00:40:11,375 --> 00:40:13,614
Do you know why I want to become a singer so badly?

715
00:40:20,154 --> 00:40:23,215
Woo Ri, you're back. Go on and get to bed.

716
00:40:25,485 --> 00:40:28,594
You're going to the hospital tomorrow, aren't you?

717
00:40:28,824 --> 00:40:30,323
Do you want me to come with you...

718
00:40:30,324 --> 00:40:31,824
since it's your first time visiting an OB-GYN clinic?

719
00:40:32,625 --> 00:40:34,965
No, I'm not a kid.

720
00:40:35,335 --> 00:40:37,234
You should go and sleep.

721
00:40:37,235 --> 00:40:38,335
All right.

("I dreamed of being an actor thanks to my first love who vanished.")

724
00:41:19,704 --> 00:41:22,315
Excuse me, Ms. Lee Ma Ri.

725
00:41:23,945 --> 00:41:25,085
Ms. Lee Ma Ri.

726

Are you ready for the artificial insemination?

727
00:41:29,415 --> 00:41:30,525
Yes.

728
00:41:32,085 --> 00:41:33,454
I'm sorry.

729
00:41:34,355 --> 00:41:37,263
I'm under the weather lately.

730
00:41:37,264 --> 00:41:39,224
It's important that you keep in shape.

731
00:41:39,994 --> 00:41:43,605
Rest up today and don't do any intense workouts.

732
00:41:47,904 --> 00:41:50,145
Doctor, are you crying?

733
00:41:50,645 --> 00:41:52,674
I'll get it done quickly. Let's get your feet up.

734
00:41:52,675 --> 00:41:54,613
Wait, are you really okay?

735
00:41:54,614 --> 00:41:57,215
I'm completely fine. I'll be quick.

736
00:41:57,884 --> 00:41:58,915
Gosh.

737
00:41:59,215 --> 00:42:00,255
Ms. Oh Woo Ri.

738
00:42:01,085 --> 00:42:03,554
Sorry? My name is Lee Ma Ri.

739
00:42:11,565 --> 00:42:13,593

My gosh, I'm sorry.

743
00:42:21,434 --> 00:42:23,945
You're not here because of vaginitis.

744
00:42:25,645 --> 00:42:27,014
- Ms. Oh Woo Ri was... - What?

745
00:42:27,675 --> 00:42:28,675
Oh Woo Ri?

746
00:42:31,244 --> 00:42:34,085
Ms. Lee. You're here for artificial insemination, right?

747
00:42:34,614 --> 00:42:35,715
Yes.

748
00:42:35,815 --> 00:42:37,254
They said they were thawing the semen.

749
00:42:37,255 --> 00:42:38,684
Can I get it done now?

750
00:42:39,884 --> 00:42:41,855
My husband underwent chemotherapy,

751
00:42:42,125 --> 00:42:44,165
so this is the last one left.

752
00:42:44,724 --> 00:42:46,934
I must get pregnant in one go.

753
00:42:47,264 --> 00:42:50,465
I trust that you'll make it happen.

754
00:42:52,034 --> 00:42:53,335
Well, the thing is...

755
00:42:55,304 --> 00:42:56,634
Is there a problem?

756
00:43:01,244 --> 00:43:02,343
No, not at all.

757
00:43:02,344 --> 00:43:03,914
You injected it into someone else's womb?

758
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:05,145
My gosh, honey.

759
00:43:06,684 --> 00:43:08,554
- When do we find out the results? - In two weeks.

760
00:43:10,755 --> 00:43:11,925
Then for the next two weeks,

761
00:43:13,054 --> 00:43:14,453
let's not do anything and just wait.

762
00:43:14,454 --> 00:43:15,723
Are you out of your mind?

763
00:43:15,724 --> 00:43:17,624
I need to get this sorted out as soon as possible.

764
00:43:17,625 --> 00:43:19,064
That's why I called you.

765
00:43:19,065 --> 00:43:21,735
Then do you want to get sued and have your medical license suspended?

766
00:43:22,134 --> 00:43:24,235
You'll be jobless and penniless after paying the settlement money.

767
00:43:24,634 --> 00:43:26,505
You'll have no future.

768
00:43:26,804 --> 00:43:28,104
Then what should I do?

769
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:29,675
You know, the odds are 50-50.

770
00:43:30,074 --> 00:43:32,775
She'll either get pregnant or not.

771
00:43:33,304 --> 00:43:34,545
If she doesn't get pregnant,

772
00:43:34,844 --> 00:43:36,215
no one will ever know.

773
00:43:37,045 --> 00:43:38,514
And that will be that.

774
00:43:39,244 --> 00:43:41,454
I called this urgent meeting to discuss something very important.

775
00:43:42,284 --> 00:43:45,154
We must unite and join forces to pull this off!

778

00:44:00,105 --> 00:44:02,934
This must be kept strictly confidential!

When is the D-Day?

785
00:44:09,715 --> 00:44:11,244
The D-Day should be...

786
00:44:14,554 --> 00:44:16,755
Hey, wrap up the pool hall murder soon.

787
00:44:17,855 --> 00:44:20,085
We arrested the perps two days after the incident took place.

788
00:44:21,195 --> 00:44:22,424
Woo Ri.

789
00:44:22,425 --> 00:44:24,264
You remember that we're meeting this evening, right?

790
00:44:24,494 --> 00:44:25,824
There's something I must tell you.

791
00:44:26,795 --> 00:44:28,235
Because of this, the higher-ups are...

792
00:44:28,295 --> 00:44:29,395
You know?

793
00:44:29,534 --> 00:44:31,304
Wrap it up by the end of tomorrow, okay?

794
00:44:31,735 --> 00:44:32,864
- Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

795
00:44:33,775 --> 00:44:34,934
That's it for the meeting.

796
00:44:35,634 --> 00:44:37,204
- Captain. - Yes.

797
00:44:37,474 --> 00:44:39,244
You're not going to talk about that thing?

798
00:44:40,045 --> 00:44:41,974
It's not for certain yet. Don't bring it up.

799
00:44:42,945 --> 00:44:45,244
Since when did we only investigate things we knew for certain?

800
00:44:46,244 --> 00:44:47,415
What is it?

801
00:44:47,855 --> 00:44:48,915
Come on. What is it?

802
00:44:50,625 --> 00:44:52,183
That name was brought up.

803
00:44:52,184 --> 00:44:53,594
Hey, I told you to keep it to yourself.

804
00:44:55,654 --> 00:44:56,755

- Hey! - Hey, stop!

809
00:45:15,915 --> 00:45:17,243
- Calm down. - Let go!

810
00:45:17,244 --> 00:45:18,644
- Let go of me! - Stop. Calm down.

811
00:45:18,645 --> 00:45:20,884
- Darn it! - Stop.

00:45:31,994 --> 00:45:33,125
Of course.

817

We're married.

818
00:45:35,195 --> 00:45:36,264
But...

819
00:45:36,364 --> 00:45:38,534
you should've at least asked me before you did this.

820
00:45:38,704 --> 00:45:40,404
Well...

821
00:45:41,105 --> 00:45:43,704
I wanted to surprise you.

822
00:45:44,275 --> 00:45:45,545
But you know, Ma Ri.

823
00:45:47,114 --> 00:45:48,815
I told you that I wanted a divorce.

824
00:45:49,715 --> 00:45:51,585
I don't want a divorce.

825
00:45:56,384 --> 00:45:57,525
Okay.

826
00:45:58,724 --> 00:46:00,025
Then get out, will you?

827
00:46:05,165 --> 00:46:06,295
Okay.

828
00:46:07,465 --> 00:46:10,034

829

00:54:18,355 --> 00:54:20,554
- My goodness. - No, I'm not.

973
00:54:20,684 --> 00:54:23,195
- No, right? - Of course, not a chance.

974
00:54:25,565 --> 00:54:26,724
We did a blood test.

975
00:54:26,965 --> 00:54:29,533
If the Beta-hCG test result is between 5 and 10,

976
00:54:29,534 --> 00:54:31,334
it's safe to say you're pregnant. But it's over 20.

977
00:54:31,335 --> 00:54:32,704
You are pregnant.

978
00:54:37,904 --> 00:54:38,974
You guys!

979
00:54:40,574 --> 00:54:42,614
No, never.

980
00:54:43,145 --> 00:54:45,415
No way. That's impossible.

981
00:54:46,585 --> 00:54:48,684
- Why? - Because I'm...

982
00:54:55,554 --> 00:54:57,494
Shall we talk in private?

983
00:54:57,994 --> 00:54:58,994
No.

984
00:55:00,425 --> 00:55:01,634
Run the tests again.

985
00:55:05,505 --> 00:55:07,303
Negative results can be incorrect at times,

986
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:09,134

987

994
00:55:31,895 --> 00:55:34,764
- Did you guys do it? - Do what?

995
00:55:34,994 --> 00:55:37,934
Well, I should get going.

996
00:55:38,034 --> 00:55:40,133
- If there are other issues... - I said, I'm not pregnant!

997

Right. I heard you,

998

but you don't need to explain it to me.

00:55:45,545 --> 00:55:46,804
The Virgin Mary...

1001
00:55:47,715 --> 00:55:49,145
Could this be a miracle?

1002
00:55:49,675 --> 00:55:50,775
Woo Ri!

1003
00:55:51,384 --> 00:55:53,044
Doctor, could you run the tests just once more?

1004
00:55:53,045 --> 00:55:54,113
This makes no sense.

1005
00:55:54,114 --> 00:55:55,383
- We've already done it twice... - Thank you.

1006
00:55:55,384 --> 00:55:56,653
- and got the same results. - I'm off.

1007
00:55:56,654 --> 00:55:58,484
But we didn't even do anything, you see.

1008
00:55:58,485 --> 00:55:59,883
I can't believe this is happening to my child.

1009
00:55:59,884 --> 00:56:02,425
This is none of my business, so I'm leaving.

1010
00:56:02,494 --> 00:56:04,223
I told you. Nothing happened.

1011
00:56:04,224 --> 00:56:05,925
Wait, quiet!

1012
00:56:10,764 --> 00:56:12,204
There is no way I'm pregnant.

1013
00:56:14,375 --> 00:56:16,934
Sir, I'm sorry for taking up your time.

1014
00:56:17,675 --> 00:56:20,945
Kang Jae, you should be at work too. Get going.

1015
00:56:21,014 --> 00:56:23,243
Yes. Right, no way.

1016
00:56:23,244 --> 00:56:24,283
I can go, right?

1017
00:56:24,284 --> 00:56:26,343
- I'll be off, then. - Doctor, what did you do?

1018
00:56:26,344 --> 00:56:28,255
Stop. It's fine.

1019
00:56:28,915 --> 00:56:30,415
I'll go to my OB-GYN clinic.

1020
00:56:34,295 --> 00:56:36,425
You are pregnant.

1021
00:56:41,965 --> 00:56:43,195
I'm really sorry.

1022
00:56:44,735 --> 00:56:47,034
You artificially inseminated...

1023
00:56:48,034 --> 00:56:49,304
my daughter?

1024
00:56:57,715 --> 00:57:00,384
It was an accident, so we can abort the foetus right away.

1025
00:57:01,054 --> 00:57:04,454
Then you can return to your normal day-to-day life.

1026
00:57:05,184 --> 00:57:06,654
I sincerely apologize.

1027
00:57:09,695 --> 00:57:13,323
Ma'am! Please... Ma'am, I'm really sorry.

1028
00:57:13,324 --> 00:57:15,594
Please don't do this.

1029
00:57:16,195 --> 00:57:18,363
- Please! - Please calm down.

1030
00:57:18,364 --> 00:57:20,434
- Calm down. - Stop!

1031
00:57:41,795 --> 00:57:42,994
You can take my seat.

1032
00:58:11,284 --> 00:58:12,625
(Seo Gwi Nyeo's Pork Cutlet)

1033
00:58:24,534 --> 00:58:26,735
Woo Ri!

1034
00:58:28,005 --> 00:58:29,105
Kang Jae.

1035
00:58:29,335 --> 00:58:32,175
What did your OB-GYN say? The doctor was wrong, right?

1036
00:58:33,945 --> 00:58:36,473
Yes, he was.

1037
00:58:36,474 --> 00:58:38,614
Goodness. What's the matter with that ER doctor?

1038
00:58:39,585 --> 00:58:41,085
Did your doctor say anything else?

1039
00:58:42,884 --> 00:58:44,925
She said I was a little anaemic.

1040
00:58:46,454 --> 00:58:49,195
- Are you okay now? - Yes, I'm fine.

1041
00:58:49,625 --> 00:58:50,654
Thank goodness.

1042
00:58:51,525 --> 00:58:54,364
I said I had to talk to you about something today, remember?

1043
00:58:55,134 --> 00:58:56,565
Do you have some time now?

1044
00:59:03,735 --> 00:59:05,844
- Woo Ri. - Yes.

1045
00:59:06,244 --> 00:59:09,244
You know, we've known each other for four years...

1046
00:59:09,474 --> 00:59:11,014
and have been together for two years,

1047
00:59:11,514 --> 00:59:13,045
which is a long time.

1048
00:59:13,344 --> 00:59:14,344
Yes.

1049
00:59:14,715 --> 00:59:16,755
I'm not sure how you'd feel about this,

1050
00:59:17,284 --> 00:59:19,085
but I think it's about time.

1051
00:59:20,585 --> 00:59:21,994
I've made up my mind.

1052
00:59:25,665 --> 00:59:26,695
Woo Ri.

1053
00:59:29,594 --> 00:59:30,895
Will you marry me?

1054
00:59:33,505 --> 00:59:34,505
Oh...

1055
00:59:40,775 --> 00:59:42,945
Azaleas, you're on.

1056
00:59:45,215 --> 00:59:47,684
- Even in the worst wind - Even in the worst wind

1057
00:59:48,585 --> 00:59:51,384
- And rain - And rain

1058
00:59:52,224 --> 00:59:57,494
- I am not alone - I am not alone

1059
00:59:57,724 --> 00:59:59,294
Dandelions, go!

1060
00:59:59,295 --> 01:00:01,763
- No matter how exhausted I am - No matter how exhausted I am

1061
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:02,933
(Only you, Oh Woo Ri)

1062
01:00:02,934 --> 01:00:06,005
- After a long, hard day - After a long, hard day

1063
01:00:06,335 --> 01:00:11,605
- It's worth it - It's worth it

1064
01:00:12,105 --> 01:00:17,374
- Because you're always by my side - Because you're always by my side

1065
01:00:17,375 --> 01:00:22,384
- Filling my life - Filling my life

1066
01:00:23,815 --> 01:00:26,054
- With wonder - With wonder

1067
01:00:27,384 --> 01:00:29,355
Because I met you

1068
01:00:30,755 --> 01:00:36,335
And because I can stroke your hair

1069
01:00:44,335 --> 01:00:46,505
- I'm so glad - I'm so glad

1070
01:00:46,904 --> 01:00:53,384
- Because of this beautiful world - Because of this beautiful world

1071
01:00:54,985 --> 01:00:57,315
- Called you - Called you

1072
01:01:16,375 --> 01:01:17,434
Woo Ri.

1073
01:01:19,105 --> 01:01:21,974
Will you marry me?

1074
01:01:25,085 --> 01:01:26,284
Kang Jae.

1075
01:01:30,915 --> 01:01:32,855
I'm pregnant.

1076
01:01:36,554 --> 01:01:38,464
You're pregnant?

1077
01:01:38,465 --> 01:01:40,665
- Pregnant? - She's pregnant?

1078
01:01:46,034 --> 01:01:48,735
Who's the father?

1079
01:02:00,184 --> 01:02:04,855
(We thank Hwangwoo Seul Hye for her special appearance.)

1080
01:02:19,505 --> 01:02:22,304
(Woori the Virgin)

1081
01:02:22,474 --> 01:02:23,933
You must produce an heir.

1082
01:02:23,934 --> 01:02:25,344
It's not happening!

1083
01:02:25,445 --> 01:02:26,874
I'll give you two million dollars.

1084
01:02:26,875 --> 01:02:28,474
Please give birth to my grandchild.

1085
01:02:28,514 --> 01:02:29,945
I'll just pretend it never happened.

1086
01:02:30,045 --> 01:02:33,214
We will never conceive a child.

1087
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:34,884
What about my life?

1088
01:02:34,985 --> 01:02:36,815
It's someone we both know.

1089
01:02:37,585 --> 01:02:38,954
Do you want to ruin your own life?

1090
01:02:38,985 --> 01:02:40,554
Did I ruin your life, Mom?

1091
01:02:40,755 --> 01:02:41,824
She's pregnant?

1092
01:02:41,895 --> 01:02:44,054
All I'm asking you to do is give birth to the child.

1093
01:02:44,454 --> 01:02:45,925
Hey! Watch what you say!

1094
01:02:46,195 --> 01:02:48,235
The thing is, Ms. Oh Woo Ri...

1095
01:02:54,675 --> 01:02:58,545
(Woori the Virgin)
