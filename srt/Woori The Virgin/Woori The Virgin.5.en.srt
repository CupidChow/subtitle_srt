(Episode 5)

10
00:00:35,562 --> 00:00:36,631
Woo Ri.

11
00:00:37,601 --> 00:00:39,902
- Woo Ri! - Is he out of his mind?

12
00:00:39,962 --> 00:00:42,072
- Hey. - Woo Ri.

13
00:00:43,402 --> 00:00:46,472
Woo Ri. I'm your father.

14
00:00:47,771 --> 00:00:48,911
Dad?

15
00:00:49,472 --> 00:00:51,241
- Let go. - Goodness.

16
00:00:53,481 --> 00:00:54,981
Yes, I'm your dad.

17
00:00:56,682 --> 00:00:58,182
What are you talking about?

18
00:00:58,521 --> 00:01:00,251
How could you be my dad?

19
00:01:00,252 --> 00:01:02,451
Because I am. I am your father.

20
00:01:03,252 --> 00:01:05,121
Mom, what's he saying?

21
00:01:05,292 --> 00:01:08,430
Well, the thing is...

22
00:01:08,431 --> 00:01:10,791
- You said Dad passed away. - I'm not dead.

23
00:01:10,892 --> 00:01:12,901
I'm right here. Your dad is right here.

24
00:01:16,101 --> 00:01:17,172
Mom.

25
00:01:18,241 --> 00:01:20,002
Is he really my dad?

26
00:01:24,681 --> 00:01:25,711
Yes.

27
00:01:26,011 --> 00:01:27,982
Why? How?

28
00:01:28,582 --> 00:01:30,982
You said Dad passed away. How could he be my dad?

29
00:01:31,122 --> 00:01:32,881
Your mother lied to you.

30
00:01:33,752 --> 00:01:36,821
She can no longer hide the truth from you.

31
00:01:37,151 --> 00:01:39,622
Eun Ran, tell her the truth.

32
00:01:39,862 --> 00:01:43,790
My goodness. I guess you drank too much.

33
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:46,160
No, Mother. I didn't have a single drop of alcohol.

34
00:01:46,161 --> 00:01:49,002
"Mother"? Grandma, you knew too?

35
00:01:49,032 --> 00:01:50,071
What?

36
00:01:50,372 --> 00:01:54,571
Yes, I only found out recently.

37
00:01:57,411 --> 00:01:58,582
You all knew except for me?

38
00:02:02,452 --> 00:02:03,952
I was the only one who didn't know?

39
00:02:11,991 --> 00:02:13,161
Wait, Woo Ri.

40
00:02:14,462 --> 00:02:16,791
Hey! You stay out of this.

41
00:02:17,462 --> 00:02:20,731
Mom, what do we do? Can you go talk to her?

42
00:02:21,231 --> 00:02:22,431
She's your daughter.

43
00:02:22,432 --> 00:02:24,070
And I'm your daughter.

44
00:02:24,071 --> 00:02:25,772
What do you want me to do?

45
00:02:27,812 --> 00:02:28,872
Well...

46
00:02:29,611 --> 00:02:31,812
I should get going.

47
00:02:31,911 --> 00:02:32,981
What?

48
00:02:34,111 --> 00:02:35,381
All right.

49
00:02:40,981 --> 00:02:43,521
What? What is it? Oh, right.

50
00:02:43,522 --> 00:02:46,861
I... I should get going too.

51
00:02:47,761 --> 00:02:48,761
Okay.

52
00:02:53,331 --> 00:02:54,361
Bye.

53
00:03:14,522 --> 00:03:17,152
(Choi Seoung Il)

54
00:03:32,872 --> 00:03:35,842
Mom, what was Dad like?

55
00:03:36,372 --> 00:03:37,641
Was he handsome?

56
00:03:39,581 --> 00:03:40,682
Of course.

57
00:03:41,212 --> 00:03:43,812
He was very famous for his handsome looks.

58
00:03:44,821 --> 00:03:46,281
Everyone said...

59
00:03:46,282 --> 00:03:48,291
he looked like Leonardo DiCaprio from "Romeo and Juliet".

60
00:03:49,951 --> 00:03:51,661
And he was very athletic too.

61
00:03:52,022 --> 00:03:53,062
He was a team captain.

62
00:03:53,722 --> 00:03:57,062
What kind of team? Soccer? Baseball?

63
00:03:57,532 --> 00:03:58,962
Basketball is cool too.

64
00:03:59,562 --> 00:04:02,131
Yes, basketball. He was the captain of a basketball team.

65
00:04:03,231 --> 00:04:05,272
On top of that, he even got good grades.

66
00:04:05,742 --> 00:04:08,041
He won awards in math competitions...

67
00:04:08,411 --> 00:04:10,372
and even participated in writing contests.

68
00:04:10,911 --> 00:04:12,011
Really?

69
00:04:12,611 --> 00:04:15,752
Is that why I'm a good writer? Because I take after Dad?

70
00:04:17,411 --> 00:04:18,622
I guess so.

71
00:04:20,321 --> 00:04:22,122
Anyway, he was good at everything.

72
00:04:22,992 --> 00:04:24,122
Maybe that's why.

73
00:04:24,792 --> 00:04:27,461
The Lord loved him so much that he took him at such a young age.

74
00:04:29,531 --> 00:04:33,461
Woo Ri, what would you want to do with him the most if he were alive?

75
00:04:34,062 --> 00:04:35,502
Nothing special.

76
00:04:37,002 --> 00:04:38,341
Just... You know.

77
00:04:40,172 --> 00:04:42,172
The things that other kids do with their dads.

78
00:04:42,742 --> 00:04:43,942
All of it.

79
00:04:46,982 --> 00:04:48,352
I envy you, Mom.

80
00:04:49,552 --> 00:04:50,581
For what?

81
00:04:50,781 --> 00:04:52,651
You've met Dad.

82
00:04:55,651 --> 00:04:58,521
Right, that's true.

83
00:05:06,102 --> 00:05:09,802
I'm sorry, Mom. I'll never bring up Dad again.

84
00:05:15,612 --> 00:05:16,812
It's okay.

85
00:05:22,951 --> 00:05:24,312
Why did you lie to me?

86
00:05:24,622 --> 00:05:26,321
We didn't have to live with him.

87
00:05:26,422 --> 00:05:28,922
You could've at least told me that my dad was alive somewhere.

88
00:05:30,252 --> 00:05:31,320
I'm sorry.

89
00:05:31,321 --> 00:05:33,992
You robbed me of the person called Dad.

90
00:05:34,062 --> 00:05:35,992
Why did you lie? Why?

91
00:05:36,761 --> 00:05:38,400
Then you should've never let me find out.

92
00:05:38,401 --> 00:05:40,802
Why tell me now? Just why?

93
00:05:42,802 --> 00:05:44,002
I'm sorry.

94
00:05:46,942 --> 00:05:48,672
I really hate you.

95
00:05:50,812 --> 00:05:53,381
How am I going to face you from now on?

96
00:06:09,492 --> 00:06:11,761
(Seo Gwi Nyeo's Pork Cutlet)

97
00:06:32,552 --> 00:06:34,151
You're going to stay here with me?

98
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:36,692
Raphael thinks that your parents live abroad.

99
00:06:36,922 --> 00:06:39,122
He thinks that you have no family in Korea.

100
00:06:39,662 --> 00:06:41,992
What if he finds out that I'm here?

101
00:06:43,631 --> 00:06:46,161
He won't know. I told him I was staying with a relative.

102
00:06:46,162 --> 00:06:48,901
I told you to just hold out until we came up with a plan.

103
00:06:49,831 --> 00:06:53,071
You see, I'm human too. How can I stay there and hold out?

104
00:06:53,201 --> 00:06:54,840
I got ahead of myself and ruined everything.

105
00:06:54,841 --> 00:06:56,411
It's all over! Happy now?

106
00:06:56,412 --> 00:06:59,312
Mal Ja. What? It's over?

107
00:06:59,542 --> 00:07:02,982
If you're homeless and have starved for a few days,

108
00:07:03,412 --> 00:07:04,651
then you can tell me it's over.

109
00:07:05,021 --> 00:07:07,320
You know what it's like because we've been there.

110
00:07:07,321 --> 00:07:09,451
Do you think I want to live like that?

111
00:07:09,692 --> 00:07:11,661
I want to keep wearing nice clothes like this,

112
00:07:11,662 --> 00:07:13,821
and I want the Star Cafe building!

113
00:07:13,992 --> 00:07:16,732
But it's just not working! Darn it...

114
00:07:21,471 --> 00:07:24,802
I'll just get a job that pays decently.

115
00:07:25,172 --> 00:07:27,641
Let's just live in peace.

116
00:07:30,872 --> 00:07:34,182
I guess you've been under a lot of stress.

117
00:07:35,211 --> 00:07:36,381
Mal Ja.

118
00:07:37,581 --> 00:07:38,781
Look at me.

119
00:07:39,982 --> 00:07:41,151
Mal Ja.

120
00:07:47,792 --> 00:07:49,562
Hey, what happened to your face?

121
00:07:51,531 --> 00:07:52,802
Hello.

122
00:07:54,732 --> 00:07:57,172
Hello, I'm the one who called.

123
00:07:57,971 --> 00:07:59,701
You see, my husband...

124
00:08:01,071 --> 00:08:02,872
My gosh, it looks bad.

125
00:08:03,511 --> 00:08:04,781
Sir, please come with us.

126
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:06,941
Sorry? Me? Why?

127
00:08:06,942 --> 00:08:08,751
We received a call regarding a domestic violence incident.

128
00:08:08,752 --> 00:08:10,751
- What? - Come with us.

129
00:08:10,752 --> 00:08:13,051
Hold on. Hey, Lee Ma Ri.

130
00:08:13,052 --> 00:08:14,352
Are you out of your mind?

131
00:08:14,521 --> 00:08:16,090
Did you just hit your daughter?

132
00:08:16,091 --> 00:08:19,090
No, I did not. Your husband did.

133
00:08:19,091 --> 00:08:20,561
What are you saying?

134
00:08:20,562 --> 00:08:23,162
Get your act together!

135
00:08:23,232 --> 00:08:25,261
This is our last chance!

136
00:08:25,562 --> 00:08:27,661
Go to the hospital now and call Raphael.

137
00:08:27,662 --> 00:08:28,931
Call the police too.

138
00:08:28,932 --> 00:08:32,071
Tell them that your husband hit you during an argument!

139
00:08:32,841 --> 00:08:33,901
My goodness.

140
00:08:37,571 --> 00:08:39,741
Wait, Ma Ri. Hey!

141
00:08:42,351 --> 00:08:43,782
Have you lost your mind?

142
00:08:43,912 --> 00:08:46,052
I told you I wanted a divorce. Why are you doing this?

143
00:08:46,782 --> 00:08:49,850
What is it? You want more alimony?

144
00:08:49,851 --> 00:08:51,662
I don't need money.

145
00:08:51,892 --> 00:08:54,792
I only want one thing.

146
00:08:55,461 --> 00:08:59,162
Your love. And us living a happy life together.

147
00:09:00,262 --> 00:09:01,432
What?

148
00:09:02,272 --> 00:09:05,272
You think you can get what you want by pressing charges against me?

149
00:09:08,611 --> 00:09:10,311
I just want you to know that I'm doing this...

150
00:09:10,312 --> 00:09:12,782
out of desperation because I really don't want to lose you.

151
00:09:13,912 --> 00:09:17,282
If rumors get out that you hit me, it won't do you any good.

152
00:09:17,412 --> 00:09:18,882
What if people at the hospital find out?

153
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:22,251
And what if Woo Ri finds out?

154
00:09:23,152 --> 00:09:24,621
Then she won't give you the baby.

155
00:09:25,361 --> 00:09:27,162
So you need this resolved fast, right?

156
00:09:30,892 --> 00:09:32,662
Is this a threat?

157
00:09:34,701 --> 00:09:36,371
You're really messed up.

158
00:10:01,591 --> 00:10:02,860
(I want to play badminton with Dad.)

159
00:10:02,861 --> 00:10:04,061
(I'm so curious what Dad looked like.)

160
00:10:04,062 --> 00:10:05,131
(Dad won awards in math competitions.)

161
00:10:05,132 --> 00:10:06,161
(He was good at basketball too.)

162
00:10:06,162 --> 00:10:08,532
(Dad was handsome like Leonardo DiCaprio.)

163
00:10:25,851 --> 00:10:26,981
Mom.

164
00:10:28,292 --> 00:10:29,551
Grandma.

165
00:10:29,552 --> 00:10:31,120
- Do you want more bread? - Sure.

166
00:10:31,121 --> 00:10:33,361
- Okay. Mom, I need more bread. - Here.

167
00:10:48,101 --> 00:10:49,642
I really...

168
00:10:50,542 --> 00:10:51,782
have a dad.

169
00:11:05,162 --> 00:11:06,392
You're here.

170
00:11:06,922 --> 00:11:09,831
Yes, hi.

171
00:11:12,302 --> 00:11:13,831
You know, my friend...

172
00:11:14,231 --> 00:11:17,071
is getting hitched. She sent me her wedding invitation,

173
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:19,371
but the guy is nine years older.

174
00:11:20,341 --> 00:11:21,942
He looks so old.

175
00:11:22,142 --> 00:11:25,382
Even a 12-year age difference is common these days.

176
00:11:30,211 --> 00:11:31,751
By the way, what's that?

177
00:11:34,851 --> 00:11:37,751
There's something going on at home,

178
00:11:38,292 --> 00:11:40,361
so I need to stay here for a few days.

179
00:11:43,292 --> 00:11:46,361
So she fought with Kang Jae, and even her family is against it.

180
00:11:51,432 --> 00:11:52,771
Are you really going to be like this?

181
00:11:52,772 --> 00:11:53,902
Does this make sense to you?

182
00:11:54,741 --> 00:11:56,571
Be reasonable, for goodness' sake.

183
00:11:56,672 --> 00:11:58,740
Be reasonable...

184
00:11:58,741 --> 00:11:59,981
What for?

185
00:12:00,081 --> 00:12:01,781
Just agree not to get a divorce,

186
00:12:01,782 --> 00:12:04,011
and I'll drop the charges right away.

187
00:12:04,012 --> 00:12:05,521
Hey, this is considered a threat.

188
00:12:05,522 --> 00:12:07,321
Must you stoop so low?

189
00:12:07,552 --> 00:12:09,022
I heard Ma Ri packed up and left.

190
00:12:10,022 --> 00:12:11,251
I'll call you back.

191
00:12:13,062 --> 00:12:15,162
The housekeeper told me. What's going on?

192
00:12:15,632 --> 00:12:16,991
Must I hear about it from someone else?

193
00:12:19,262 --> 00:12:20,501
Yes, it's true.

194
00:12:20,632 --> 00:12:21,932
I'm getting a divorce.

195
00:12:22,302 --> 00:12:23,571
Why are you at it again?

196
00:12:24,402 --> 00:12:25,841
You've fully recovered.

197
00:12:26,142 --> 00:12:28,740
Now, you two can live a happy life together with the baby.

198
00:12:28,741 --> 00:12:30,442
Why would you get a divorce?

199
00:12:31,012 --> 00:12:32,282
It makes no sense.

200
00:12:34,611 --> 00:12:35,711
Ma Ri...

201
00:12:37,012 --> 00:12:38,152
You see,

202
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:39,652
Ma Ri...

203
00:12:43,851 --> 00:12:45,022
Forget it.

204
00:12:45,591 --> 00:12:47,360
It's complicated and personal.

205
00:12:47,361 --> 00:12:48,932
Should we just quit the cosmetics business?

206
00:12:49,331 --> 00:12:52,461
Do you know how many companies we work with through her?

207
00:12:52,861 --> 00:12:54,761
You said you'd take care of managing the hospital too.

208
00:12:54,762 --> 00:12:56,801
Do you not care about the hospital? You can't get a divorce!

209
00:12:56,802 --> 00:12:57,932
What?

210
00:12:58,132 --> 00:12:59,871
It's a personal matter.

211
00:13:00,371 --> 00:13:03,071
Why are you trying to link it to the hospital?

212
00:13:08,481 --> 00:13:09,782
Do not talk back to me.

213
00:13:16,152 --> 00:13:17,821
Darn it.

214
00:13:25,432 --> 00:13:26,632
Gummy Bear.

215
00:13:28,772 --> 00:13:31,402
I feel like there's no one else in the world but just the two of us.

216
00:13:41,882 --> 00:13:43,211
Will Seoung Il like this?

217
00:13:43,851 --> 00:13:45,381
Do you think he'll like this?

218
00:13:45,382 --> 00:13:47,681
It's not touching or engaging. It's about forgiveness?

219
00:13:47,682 --> 00:13:49,192
Come on! That's too boring.

220
00:13:49,451 --> 00:13:50,692
He must seek revenge.

221
00:13:51,152 --> 00:13:53,292
Are you telling me to write scripts just to please the actors?

222
00:13:53,422 --> 00:13:57,090
The character can't suddenly change his personality and do that.

223
00:13:57,091 --> 00:13:59,361
This is the way it should be based on Chun Sa Da's personality!

224
00:14:00,001 --> 00:14:01,132
Ms. Yu.

225
00:14:01,331 --> 00:14:02,672
Did you just yell at me?

226
00:14:03,272 --> 00:14:04,431
This isn't your first drama.

227
00:14:04,432 --> 00:14:06,340
Do you not know what the viewers want?

228
00:14:06,341 --> 00:14:08,041
So you only care about the ratings.

229
00:14:08,042 --> 00:14:10,371
You don't care about the quality of the drama!

230
00:14:13,912 --> 00:14:15,081
Please calm down.

231
00:14:15,882 --> 00:14:18,682
Let's have this meeting again some other time.

232
00:14:19,382 --> 00:14:21,991
If you don't fix the script, I won't shoot.

233
00:14:23,422 --> 00:14:24,851
I won't shoot a single scene.

234
00:14:27,221 --> 00:14:28,491
Has he lost his mind?

235
00:14:29,361 --> 00:14:31,761
He can go ahead and shoot without a script, then.

236
00:14:31,762 --> 00:14:34,132
They can say and do whatever they want in the drama.

237
00:14:34,361 --> 00:14:35,870
Director Park... I can't believe this.

238
00:14:35,871 --> 00:14:38,701
He was a mere staffer when we were working on Writer Wang's drama.

239
00:14:39,802 --> 00:14:42,471
He couldn't even talk back to me back then!

240
00:14:43,272 --> 00:14:45,382
Please, have some water.

241
00:14:51,851 --> 00:14:53,921
Ever since she was Writer Wang's assistant,

242
00:14:53,922 --> 00:14:56,051
I've helped her out so much.

243
00:14:56,052 --> 00:14:58,392
But she thinks she got to where she is all on her own!

244
00:14:59,361 --> 00:15:00,961
I should've never helped her.

245
00:15:01,392 --> 00:15:03,361
All right, let's go.

246
00:15:05,262 --> 00:15:06,402
That jerk.

247
00:15:07,601 --> 00:15:08,672
Woo Ri.

248
00:15:10,932 --> 00:15:11,970
Mr. Choi.

249
00:15:11,971 --> 00:15:13,172
You must've been so surprised.

250
00:15:16,172 --> 00:15:17,542
I bet you didn't get any sleep either.

251
00:15:18,111 --> 00:15:19,341
Oh, dear.

252
00:15:20,182 --> 00:15:22,152
Are you free this evening by any chance?

253
00:15:22,412 --> 00:15:23,981
I want to have a talk with you.

254
00:15:32,961 --> 00:15:34,162
Sure.

255
00:15:34,991 --> 00:15:36,932
- I'm free. - That's great.

256
00:15:37,262 --> 00:15:40,562
Then I'll text you where and when to meet.

257
00:15:40,601 --> 00:15:41,731
All right.

258
00:15:42,772 --> 00:15:43,902
- Seoung Il. - Yes?

259
00:15:44,172 --> 00:15:45,672
Must you choose the hard path?

260
00:15:46,672 --> 00:15:47,971
You don't care what others might say?

261
00:15:49,172 --> 00:15:50,571
Did they change my lines?

262
00:15:52,012 --> 00:15:53,241
- Let's go talk about your outfits. - What?

263
00:15:53,642 --> 00:15:54,741
Okay.

264
00:16:17,532 --> 00:16:18,871
Hello.

265
00:16:23,571 --> 00:16:24,711
Here, it's for you.

266
00:16:27,981 --> 00:16:29,152
Thank you.

267
00:16:29,211 --> 00:16:30,382
My daughter.

268
00:16:30,951 --> 00:16:32,152
Let me give you a hug, just once.

269
00:16:43,662 --> 00:16:45,301
Why did you want to meet here?

270
00:16:45,302 --> 00:16:46,461
Oh, this place?

271
00:16:47,361 --> 00:16:49,501
I used to put on shows in this theater.

272
00:16:50,701 --> 00:16:51,802
Let's sit down.

273
00:16:52,701 --> 00:16:55,711
This is where I spent years in obscurity.

274
00:16:56,371 --> 00:16:58,882
I worked really hard.

275
00:16:59,142 --> 00:17:03,682
But I've found a reason to work even harder from now on.

276
00:17:04,951 --> 00:17:06,481
The reason is you.

277
00:17:07,552 --> 00:17:08,652
My daughter.

278
00:17:17,862 --> 00:17:19,301
Oh, right.

279
00:17:20,102 --> 00:17:22,231
I heard you were on a basketball team back in school.

280
00:17:22,301 --> 00:17:24,102
I'm tall, but I was never good at basketball.

281
00:17:25,971 --> 00:17:27,571
You participated in math competitions.

282
00:17:27,572 --> 00:17:30,142
No, I didn't get along with my math teacher.

283
00:17:30,342 --> 00:17:31,711
I gave up on math early on.

284
00:17:31,811 --> 00:17:33,011
I never liked math.

285
00:17:33,241 --> 00:17:34,582
Then what about writing?

286
00:17:34,711 --> 00:17:37,250
I heard you won a prize in a writing contest...

287
00:17:37,251 --> 00:17:39,981
Writing contest? Oh, please. I never even kept a diary.

288
00:17:40,281 --> 00:17:43,592
You may not believe this, but I was never good at anything.

289
00:17:43,822 --> 00:17:44,922
So...

290
00:17:45,251 --> 00:17:46,622
I had to work extremely hard...

291
00:17:47,662 --> 00:17:49,061
to come this far.

292
00:17:49,991 --> 00:17:53,131
If I were to tell you everything I've been through in life,

293
00:17:53,132 --> 00:17:55,231
we'd have to stay up all night.

294
00:17:56,471 --> 00:17:58,671
Check my social media page.

295
00:17:58,672 --> 00:18:01,872
You'll find an interview I did, which was split into five articles.

296
00:18:02,172 --> 00:18:04,912
Just read that, and you'll get an idea.

297
00:18:06,241 --> 00:18:08,981
You'll be moved to tears.

298
00:18:13,221 --> 00:18:15,451
You're following me on social media, right?

299
00:18:15,521 --> 00:18:16,591
Yes.

300
00:18:16,592 --> 00:18:18,092
My follower count is about to hit a million.

301
00:18:18,692 --> 00:18:19,862
Soon, it'll surpass a million.

302
00:18:20,362 --> 00:18:22,560
Among all the middle-aged actors,

303
00:18:22,561 --> 00:18:23,791
I have the most followers.

304
00:18:24,632 --> 00:18:25,662
I see.

305
00:18:26,662 --> 00:18:28,771
Enough about me.

306
00:18:29,501 --> 00:18:30,831
Tell me.

307
00:18:30,832 --> 00:18:34,301
I heard you did very well in school and that you're such a sweetheart.

308
00:18:34,501 --> 00:18:35,942
My gosh, no.

309
00:18:38,241 --> 00:18:39,382
I wish...

310
00:18:40,442 --> 00:18:43,011
I was around when you were growing up.

311
00:18:43,951 --> 00:18:48,382
Then you would've grown up in a much better environment.

312
00:18:49,991 --> 00:18:51,422
A better environment?

313
00:18:51,551 --> 00:18:52,560
Yes.

314
00:18:52,561 --> 00:18:55,961
Well, I'm not saying you grew up in a bad environment.

315
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:59,961
I just meant that it could've been better.

316
00:19:00,961 --> 00:19:02,572
Anyway, I heard you were getting married soon.

317
00:19:03,172 --> 00:19:04,301
Yes.

318
00:19:04,701 --> 00:19:08,471
Thank goodness I met you like this and can walk you down the aisle.

319
00:19:09,072 --> 00:19:10,541
It makes me so happy.

320
00:19:11,672 --> 00:19:12,811
And...

321
00:19:17,082 --> 00:19:18,511
Here, it's for you.

322
00:19:19,382 --> 00:19:21,521
No, it's okay.

323
00:19:22,192 --> 00:19:24,991
Come on. You can't buy it even if you wait in line all night.

324
00:19:25,192 --> 00:19:27,162
It's the newest laptop model. It's sold out everywhere.

325
00:19:27,592 --> 00:19:28,662
Take it.

326
00:19:28,731 --> 00:19:31,061
No, it's really okay.

327
00:19:31,531 --> 00:19:34,201
I can buy you stuff like this anytime. Just take it.

328
00:19:35,471 --> 00:19:37,301
Thank you.

329
00:19:42,372 --> 00:19:43,471
Woo Ri.

330
00:19:45,112 --> 00:19:47,612
You see, I'm getting old.

331
00:19:48,682 --> 00:19:49,852
So...

332
00:19:51,182 --> 00:19:53,622
I had almost given up on having a child.

333
00:19:54,521 --> 00:19:55,922
But all of a sudden,

334
00:19:56,551 --> 00:19:59,162
there you are, my sweet child.

335
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:02,332
You have no idea how happy I am.

336
00:20:05,701 --> 00:20:06,761
Woo Ri...

337
00:20:11,402 --> 00:20:12,902
Will you call me Dad...

338
00:20:13,842 --> 00:20:17,372
just this one time?

339
00:20:34,822 --> 00:20:35,862
Da...

340
00:20:40,061 --> 00:20:41,301
That's close enough.

341
00:20:44,271 --> 00:20:46,740
Go ahead, eat.

342
00:20:46,741 --> 00:20:49,241
You might have trouble digesting.

343
00:20:49,672 --> 00:20:51,741
You said you needed to get a new laptop.

344
00:20:52,442 --> 00:20:53,612
Just use it.

345
00:20:55,182 --> 00:20:56,612
It's just too much.

346
00:20:57,481 --> 00:20:59,521
He probably wanted to do something for you, that's why.

347
00:21:00,582 --> 00:21:02,021
How was your father?

348
00:21:02,822 --> 00:21:05,922
I don't know. This all feels unreal, still.

349
00:21:06,561 --> 00:21:08,862
I feel like someone's playing a hidden camera prank on me.

350
00:21:09,892 --> 00:21:11,332
Have you watched "The Truman Show"?

351
00:21:11,531 --> 00:21:13,201
Yes, of course. The one with Jim Carrey.

352
00:21:13,961 --> 00:21:17,172
You're just not used to it yet. It will get better.

353
00:21:17,701 --> 00:21:18,842
He's just...

354
00:21:19,301 --> 00:21:22,412
not the father I imagined.

355
00:21:22,971 --> 00:21:24,841
It's just awkward and uncomfortable.

356
00:21:24,842 --> 00:21:26,011
He's just a stranger.

357
00:21:26,311 --> 00:21:29,352
Besides, he pities me for growing up without him.

358
00:21:30,211 --> 00:21:32,821
Don't be too sensitive about it.

359
00:21:32,822 --> 00:21:34,480
You can't be friendly all of a sudden.

360
00:21:34,481 --> 00:21:35,551
Take it slow.

361
00:21:36,422 --> 00:21:37,622
Take it easy.

362
00:21:38,862 --> 00:21:41,422
By the way, is that where you're sleeping?

363
00:21:42,061 --> 00:21:43,231
Oh, dear.

364
00:21:43,491 --> 00:21:44,791
Do you want to sleep at my place?

365
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:46,500
I'll just sleep in the night-duty room.

366
00:21:46,501 --> 00:21:49,332
It's okay. I told you it was.

367
00:21:52,701 --> 00:21:55,402
Woo Ri, haven't you...

368
00:21:56,572 --> 00:21:57,872
called your mother yet?

369
00:21:59,182 --> 00:22:01,412
Why should I, when she isn't?

370
00:22:02,511 --> 00:22:04,352
What? Where do you think this is?

371
00:22:04,951 --> 00:22:06,721
I even told you not to call.

372
00:22:07,422 --> 00:22:09,521
I met with Woo Ri.

373
00:22:10,322 --> 00:22:12,521
- I even had a meal with her. - What?

374
00:22:12,721 --> 00:22:14,491
Didn't you know that I met with her?

375
00:22:14,991 --> 00:22:18,291
Woo Ri is staying at her office.

376
00:22:20,432 --> 00:22:22,572
She left home that day, then.

377
00:22:24,172 --> 00:22:26,442
I should get her some things at her office.

378
00:22:27,142 --> 00:22:28,240
You?

379
00:22:28,241 --> 00:22:30,172
She works with me.

380
00:22:30,572 --> 00:22:32,882
And I've been to her office many times before.

381
00:22:33,112 --> 00:22:34,311
Eun Ran,

382
00:22:36,051 --> 00:22:37,950
because she's my daughter,

383
00:22:37,951 --> 00:22:40,281
I get along with her so well.

384
00:22:44,622 --> 00:22:47,361
Mom, I've decided to live with Dad from now on.

385
00:22:47,362 --> 00:22:50,290
Since I lived with you for 29 years, I'll be back after 29 years.

386
00:22:50,291 --> 00:22:51,761
I'll see you after 29 years.

387
00:22:52,961 --> 00:22:54,730
Gosh, no.

388
00:22:54,731 --> 00:22:55,801
What?

389
00:22:56,432 --> 00:22:59,642
Don't you pressure her.

390
00:22:59,701 --> 00:23:01,241
She's having a hard time after the accident.

391
00:23:01,301 --> 00:23:03,970
What is that accident you've been talking about?

392
00:23:03,971 --> 00:23:06,442
You can tell me now, don't you think?

393
00:23:07,981 --> 00:23:09,481
Woo Ri being pregnant...

394
00:23:10,281 --> 00:23:11,481
was medical malpractice.

395
00:23:12,281 --> 00:23:14,182
What? Medical malpractice?

396
00:23:14,281 --> 00:23:15,322
(OB-GYN Specialist)

397
00:23:18,352 --> 00:23:20,121
Ms. An Soo Yeon.

398
00:23:20,122 --> 00:23:21,662
Yes, I'm An Soo Yeon.

399
00:23:21,862 --> 00:23:23,631
I told you already. How many times do you have to ask?

400
00:23:23,632 --> 00:23:26,560
It is not too much when it comes to checking a patient's name.

401
00:23:26,561 --> 00:23:27,960
- Wait, sir. - Let me go.

402
00:23:27,961 --> 00:23:29,871
- Why won't you let me in? - Wait, no.

403
00:23:29,872 --> 00:23:31,871
- Why can't I come in? - You can't come in here.

404
00:23:31,872 --> 00:23:34,540
Are you the one who made her pregnant?

405
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:35,740
- Who are you? - Who?

406
00:23:35,741 --> 00:23:36,941
I've made many people pregnant.

407
00:23:36,942 --> 00:23:39,280
How can you do that as a doctor?

408
00:23:39,281 --> 00:23:41,081
I should. That's what an OB-GYN doctor does.

409
00:23:41,082 --> 00:23:42,181
- OB-GYN...? - Who are you?

410
00:23:42,182 --> 00:23:43,611
Aren't you the actor from that daily drama?

411
00:23:43,612 --> 00:23:45,481
No, I'm not. You're mistaken.

412
00:23:45,582 --> 00:23:47,550
You are the one who got her pregnant.

413
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:48,681
My precious Oh Woo Ri.

414
00:23:48,682 --> 00:23:50,220
- Gosh. - Right?

415
00:23:50,221 --> 00:23:51,750
- Don't you understand? - Who are you?

416
00:23:51,751 --> 00:23:54,520
Who do you think I am? Who am I?

417
00:23:54,521 --> 00:23:57,560
I'm her uncle, I am!

418
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:00,101
- Sir, you can't do this in here. - Don't touch me.

419
00:24:00,102 --> 00:24:01,102
- What do you mean in here? - Why don't you step outside?

420
00:24:01,103 --> 00:24:02,671
- Let's step outside. - The hospital director lives...

421
00:24:02,672 --> 00:24:04,271
in Cheongdam-dong.

422
00:24:04,771 --> 00:24:06,941
This place should just disappear!

423
00:24:06,942 --> 00:24:08,571
I want this place to disappear!

424
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:11,842
I hope there are no such mistakes anymore!

425
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:22,821
- How is everyone? - Hello.

426
00:24:22,822 --> 00:24:25,450
- What brings you here unannounced? - Well...

427
00:24:25,451 --> 00:24:27,622
- Are those for me? - Of course.

428
00:24:29,132 --> 00:24:31,161
- Take a seat. - I'll share it with Woo Ri.

429
00:24:31,162 --> 00:24:33,231
Yes. What a day.

430
00:24:35,132 --> 00:24:36,832
What?

431
00:24:37,572 --> 00:24:40,771
The laptop I got you is in the corner...

432
00:24:42,172 --> 00:24:43,412
He bought that for you?

433
00:24:43,842 --> 00:24:47,382
No, it isn't. That's not it.

434
00:24:48,781 --> 00:24:51,581
Don't you think you come here too often?

435
00:24:51,582 --> 00:24:53,821
You should converse with the writer all the time...

436
00:24:53,822 --> 00:24:55,751
so that we can make this a better show.

437
00:24:56,592 --> 00:24:58,491
When do you finish work?

438
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:00,290
Why don't we have a meal together?

439
00:25:00,291 --> 00:25:02,091
How about some eel?

440
00:25:02,092 --> 00:25:04,331
Why don't you get some stamina from eating eel?

441
00:25:04,332 --> 00:25:05,432
Well...

442
00:25:05,761 --> 00:25:09,932
You must have an occasion where you need a lot of stamina.

443
00:25:10,231 --> 00:25:11,902
How did you know?

444
00:25:12,902 --> 00:25:14,601
I have a new profound life goal...

445
00:25:14,602 --> 00:25:19,142
that differs from all the things I had before.

446
00:25:23,112 --> 00:25:24,352
Right.

447
00:25:24,852 --> 00:25:26,152
You are already in that stage of the relationship.

448
00:25:28,152 --> 00:25:31,151
Woo Ri, you should go alone. I don't want to go.

449
00:25:31,152 --> 00:25:34,692
What? Why? You like eating eel.

450
00:25:35,362 --> 00:25:36,662
I'm not going.

451
00:25:38,362 --> 00:25:41,701
You must have had a difficult time living with your mom.

452
00:25:42,672 --> 00:25:44,131
Since I am around now,

453
00:25:44,132 --> 00:25:46,771
I'll try my best to do the things I can for you.

454
00:25:47,672 --> 00:25:50,571
I'm sure you couldn't do everything living by yourselves...

455
00:25:50,572 --> 00:25:52,711
and making wrong decisions as women.

456
00:25:53,281 --> 00:25:55,711
What are the things that women can't do?

457
00:25:56,551 --> 00:25:58,011
For instance,

458
00:25:59,011 --> 00:26:00,382
changing the light bulbs?

459
00:26:01,951 --> 00:26:03,991
All three of us can do that well.

460
00:26:05,822 --> 00:26:06,862
Of course.

461
00:26:07,092 --> 00:26:09,131
But since I am around now,

462
00:26:09,132 --> 00:26:12,332
I'm sure you'll have a lot to discuss with me from now on.

463
00:26:12,662 --> 00:26:14,301
Like what?

464
00:26:17,531 --> 00:26:19,971
Right. I'll just go on and say it.

465
00:26:21,142 --> 00:26:23,571
I heard you decided to have the child...

466
00:26:23,572 --> 00:26:24,572
you mistakenly got pregnant with.

467
00:26:24,872 --> 00:26:26,980
Won't you give it a second thought?

468
00:26:26,981 --> 00:26:29,511
I think you made an emotional decision.

469
00:26:31,352 --> 00:26:34,422
I don't think it's your business to get involved in.

470
00:26:34,781 --> 00:26:36,421
- It's my business. - Of course, it is.

471
00:26:36,422 --> 00:26:39,461
I'm only saying this because it's me.

472
00:26:39,491 --> 00:26:41,362
But it makes no sense to me.

473
00:26:41,761 --> 00:26:44,131
How come there was no one stopping you...

474
00:26:44,132 --> 00:26:46,402
from making such an important decision?

475
00:26:47,461 --> 00:26:51,072
You should have at least come and discussed it with me.

476
00:26:51,872 --> 00:26:53,971
What do you know about me?

477
00:26:55,041 --> 00:26:58,372
You don't know what books I like, the songs I hate,

478
00:26:58,541 --> 00:27:00,510
the reason why the cat I had for 10 years died,

479
00:27:00,511 --> 00:27:01,611
nor the name of that cat.

480
00:27:01,612 --> 00:27:03,682
You don't even know whether I like flowers or not.

481
00:27:04,551 --> 00:27:08,021
What is there to discuss with someone who knows nothing?

482
00:27:12,961 --> 00:27:13,961
Right.

483
00:27:14,622 --> 00:27:17,862
We should gradually get to know each other.

484
00:27:19,531 --> 00:27:23,102
But being pregnant is an urgent matter.

485
00:27:23,902 --> 00:27:26,072
I don't want you to have that child.

486
00:27:27,301 --> 00:27:30,311
What did you tell Mom when she got pregnant?

487
00:27:31,172 --> 00:27:33,310
Did you tell her not to have it like you are saying right now?

488
00:27:33,311 --> 00:27:34,412
No.

489
00:27:34,811 --> 00:27:36,651
I never said such a thing to Eun Ran.

490
00:27:36,652 --> 00:27:38,210
She said she wouldn't have the baby,

491
00:27:38,211 --> 00:27:40,051
- and I thought it was fortunate... - Fortunate?

492
00:27:41,221 --> 00:27:43,122
Then, I must be a misfortune to you.

493
00:27:43,352 --> 00:27:45,450
That is not what I am saying right now.

494
00:27:45,451 --> 00:27:46,491
Oh dear.

495
00:27:46,922 --> 00:27:48,021
Gosh, my head.

496
00:27:51,432 --> 00:27:52,661
Woo Ri,

497
00:27:52,662 --> 00:27:55,661
your mom's situation and yours are different.

498
00:27:55,662 --> 00:27:57,471
Don't get involved in my business.

499
00:27:57,701 --> 00:27:59,372
Don't do anything.

500
00:28:13,422 --> 00:28:15,152
Woo Ri, I'm working right now.

501
00:28:15,481 --> 00:28:17,152
Is it something urgent?

502
00:28:17,892 --> 00:28:20,291
No, it's nothing. I'm sorry.

503
00:28:30,132 --> 00:28:31,931
Long time no see.

504
00:28:31,932 --> 00:28:33,571
How are you?

505
00:28:33,572 --> 00:28:35,801
Let's go in. Cheers.

506
00:28:39,142 --> 00:28:41,240
The gambling joint is full of people.

507
00:28:41,241 --> 00:28:44,511
Captain, do you think it is possible for Shin Mi Young...

508
00:28:47,551 --> 00:28:49,791
to appear at a private gambling joint after committing a murder?

509
00:28:50,652 --> 00:28:52,092
It doesn't smell fishy.

510
00:28:52,491 --> 00:28:53,822
Are you a German Shepherd?

511
00:28:53,961 --> 00:28:55,322
Do you sniff around to investigate?

512
00:28:56,162 --> 00:28:58,161
This is the place where Shin Mi Young...

513
00:28:58,162 --> 00:29:01,761
came in and out so often that the shutters are worn out.

514
00:29:02,001 --> 00:29:03,602
Gosh, I'm not a German Shepherd.

515
00:29:04,402 --> 00:29:07,271
Chairman Kim seems to be involved with the hospital.

516
00:29:07,442 --> 00:29:09,741
Don't you think we should dig into Diamond Medical Foundation?

517
00:29:10,142 --> 00:29:13,781
No Man Chul loaned millions Shin Mi Young.

518
00:29:14,241 --> 00:29:15,341
It's quite clear that...

519
00:29:15,342 --> 00:29:17,851
No Man Chul was killed because of his debts.

520
00:29:17,852 --> 00:29:19,720
Why are you the only one talking about Chairman Kim?

521
00:29:19,721 --> 00:29:22,250
To see this as a simple personal grudge is...

522
00:29:22,251 --> 00:29:24,121
And it's suspicious that she disappeared...

523
00:29:24,122 --> 00:29:26,592
right after the CCTV was restored.

524
00:29:26,991 --> 00:29:28,790
I think there are more people involved in this.

525
00:29:28,791 --> 00:29:31,691
Be quiet. Gosh, stop thinking, will you?

526
00:29:31,692 --> 00:29:32,902
Just listen to me.

527
00:29:35,561 --> 00:29:36,572
Yes.

528
00:29:47,642 --> 00:29:49,011
Hello.

529
00:29:49,852 --> 00:29:51,152
Hello.

530
00:29:53,852 --> 00:29:56,692
I heard you were getting a divorce.

531
00:29:56,892 --> 00:29:59,121
I have no intentions of doing so.

532
00:29:59,122 --> 00:30:01,261
- Excuse me? - I don't want that...

533
00:30:01,491 --> 00:30:02,692
for the baby.

534
00:30:03,332 --> 00:30:05,162
Then, is it Raphael?

535
00:30:06,102 --> 00:30:09,201
I really hope someone would stop him.

536
00:30:09,501 --> 00:30:12,172
Gosh, are you hurt?

537
00:30:15,001 --> 00:30:16,171
Well...

538
00:30:16,172 --> 00:30:18,072
- Hello. - Hello.

539
00:30:18,511 --> 00:30:19,842
It's nothing.

540
00:30:27,751 --> 00:30:29,151
Did you hit Lee Ma Ri?

541
00:30:29,152 --> 00:30:30,221
Excuse me?

542
00:30:30,451 --> 00:30:31,721
Ms. Oh.

543
00:30:35,162 --> 00:30:37,192
Look at me. Look into my eyes.

544
00:30:37,832 --> 00:30:41,001
Do I look like someone who would hit a woman and bruise her?

545
00:30:41,362 --> 00:30:42,501
Can't you trust me?

546
00:30:46,271 --> 00:30:47,271
Sir.

547
00:30:47,272 --> 00:30:49,172
Ms. Lee's assault charge case seems...

548
00:30:51,112 --> 00:30:52,142
Shall I come back later?

549
00:30:56,551 --> 00:30:57,711
No, I'll leave.

550
00:30:58,582 --> 00:31:00,882
Wait, Ms. Oh.

551
00:31:07,362 --> 00:31:08,691
How did it go?

552
00:31:08,692 --> 00:31:11,132
It's going to be difficult to sue her for false accusations.

553
00:31:11,432 --> 00:31:14,261
And I don't think the police will look for evidence on your behalf.

554
00:31:15,461 --> 00:31:18,001
All right. I'll look into it myself as well.

555
00:31:31,011 --> 00:31:32,922
You are still in the office.

556
00:31:33,682 --> 00:31:34,921
I didn't know you were still in.

557
00:31:34,922 --> 00:31:36,152
It's okay. Go ahead.

558
00:31:38,092 --> 00:31:40,162
I'm getting in your way since I'm working late.

559
00:31:41,261 --> 00:31:43,392
It's not a problem at all.

560
00:31:43,632 --> 00:31:45,932
I'll finish up and leave quickly.

561
00:31:47,132 --> 00:31:48,501
Isn't she your wife?

562
00:31:49,402 --> 00:31:51,402
She was here alone that night.

563
00:31:54,372 --> 00:31:57,642
You went to that restroom over there that night, didn't you?

564
00:31:58,241 --> 00:31:59,442
You were on CCTV.

565
00:32:03,051 --> 00:32:04,152
So?

566
00:32:11,892 --> 00:32:13,790
She worked for a long time here in the janitorial department.

567
00:32:13,791 --> 00:32:15,521
Ms. Lee Soon Hee.

568
00:32:16,122 --> 00:32:17,231
Do you know her?

569
00:32:17,461 --> 00:32:19,030
How am I supposed to know who she is?

570
00:32:19,031 --> 00:32:20,862
She saw you in the restroom.

571
00:32:21,061 --> 00:32:23,402
She saw that you had a bruise across your eye.

572
00:32:23,501 --> 00:32:24,902
Before you even met me.

573
00:32:27,172 --> 00:32:28,501
That can't be it.

574
00:32:30,912 --> 00:32:32,642
Are you making up a false witness?

575
00:32:34,741 --> 00:32:36,352
Stop lying.

576
00:32:36,682 --> 00:32:38,010
Did you really see me?

577
00:32:38,011 --> 00:32:39,481
Lee Ma Ri, stop.

578
00:32:41,652 --> 00:32:43,451
Just sign the divorce papers quietly, will you?

579
00:32:48,961 --> 00:32:50,061
Darn it.

580
00:33:04,471 --> 00:33:05,912
(Consensual Divorce Intention Confirmation Document)

581
00:33:09,442 --> 00:33:10,511
I'm sorry.

582
00:33:11,082 --> 00:33:12,611
I'm really sorry.

583
00:33:12,612 --> 00:33:13,721
It's okay.

584
00:33:13,882 --> 00:33:15,551
The situation called for it.

585
00:33:16,451 --> 00:33:17,521
Gosh.

586
00:33:20,392 --> 00:33:21,662
I know that...

587
00:33:21,991 --> 00:33:26,402
you think the baby should be raised in a household with both parents.

588
00:33:27,531 --> 00:33:30,102
That's why I thought carefully...

589
00:33:30,632 --> 00:33:32,332
about getting back with Ma Ri.

590
00:33:32,801 --> 00:33:33,942
But...

591
00:33:34,241 --> 00:33:36,372
that wasn't right.

592
00:33:40,442 --> 00:33:43,352
I was prepared to die from cancer...

593
00:33:43,912 --> 00:33:45,382
but got a new life.

594
00:33:46,622 --> 00:33:48,652
Yet, I wasn't sure...

595
00:33:49,521 --> 00:33:50,751
how I should live.

596
00:33:51,721 --> 00:33:53,862
I had no meaning in my marriage life.

597
00:33:54,291 --> 00:33:56,162
And I still don't get along with my father.

598
00:33:57,632 --> 00:34:00,061
I don't know why I'm working.

599
00:34:01,561 --> 00:34:02,731
But...

600
00:34:03,031 --> 00:34:05,072
if I think about the baby inside you,

601
00:34:06,801 --> 00:34:10,342
I want to live a full life, being grateful for every day.

602
00:34:10,741 --> 00:34:11,971
I really do.

603
00:34:14,641 --> 00:34:18,751
But I've found a reason to work even harder from now on.

604
00:34:19,481 --> 00:34:21,422
The reason is you.

605
00:34:22,681 --> 00:34:23,922
My daughter.

606
00:34:24,751 --> 00:34:27,222
Yes, I can understand.

607
00:34:28,862 --> 00:34:31,431
I believe you'll be a good father.

608
00:34:31,992 --> 00:34:35,231
I'll make sure you have nothing to worry about.

609
00:34:35,461 --> 00:34:38,601
I'm sure you already have a lot on your plate.

610
00:34:39,842 --> 00:34:41,572
With your father and all.

611
00:34:43,242 --> 00:34:44,311
Yes.

612
00:34:48,181 --> 00:34:51,151
I grew up without a mother,

613
00:34:51,152 --> 00:34:53,681
and you grew up without a father.

614
00:34:53,722 --> 00:34:57,021
Don't you think we have a lot in common?

615
00:34:58,751 --> 00:35:00,262
Well...

616
00:35:01,391 --> 00:35:02,692
since...

617
00:35:03,632 --> 00:35:05,692
I didn't have a mother when I was younger,

618
00:35:06,431 --> 00:35:09,532
I was jealous of those kids who brought packed lunches.

619
00:35:09,931 --> 00:35:11,032
What about you?

620
00:35:11,702 --> 00:35:13,501
What were you jealous of?

621
00:35:16,811 --> 00:35:19,342
I just...

622
00:35:22,242 --> 00:35:23,452
Was it in middle school?

623
00:35:25,152 --> 00:35:27,421
I competed in a choir competition in middle school...

624
00:35:27,422 --> 00:35:29,481
and made it to the finals.

625
00:35:30,021 --> 00:35:33,262
There were so many people that filled up the auditorium,

626
00:35:34,222 --> 00:35:37,660
and I couldn't find my Mom and Grandma...

627
00:35:37,661 --> 00:35:40,061
because the light was so bright.

628
00:35:40,362 --> 00:35:42,401
But my friends who had their fathers come...

629
00:35:42,402 --> 00:35:43,632
could find them easily.

630
00:35:44,302 --> 00:35:46,671
Fathers are taller...

631
00:35:46,672 --> 00:35:49,472
so it was easy to find them if they waved.

632
00:35:50,572 --> 00:35:52,771
But I couldn't find my family until the end.

633
00:35:54,112 --> 00:35:55,311
I see.

634
00:35:57,251 --> 00:35:59,452
Now that you have a father,

635
00:36:00,121 --> 00:36:02,652
try the things...

636
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:04,621
you couldn't before.

637
00:36:12,931 --> 00:36:15,500
Woo Ri, have you seen this? We're in trouble!

638
00:36:15,501 --> 00:36:17,201
Why is Seoung Il being this way?

639
00:36:17,202 --> 00:36:19,532
Call me right after you finish watching this video.

640
00:36:20,802 --> 00:36:22,100
- What do you mean in here? - Why don't you step outside?

641
00:36:22,101 --> 00:36:23,471
- Let's step outside. - The hospital director lives...

642
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:24,911
in Cheongdam-dong.

643
00:36:25,572 --> 00:36:28,081
I saw him at the Golf course...

644
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:31,080
I know the director from that hospital and this hospital.

645
00:36:31,081 --> 00:36:33,251
You achieved something you couldn't even when you were on a variety.

646
00:36:34,081 --> 00:36:35,681
You're all over the entertainment news.

648

650
00:36:44,791 --> 00:36:46,032
Why did you do it?

651
00:36:46,601 --> 00:36:49,331
Can't we sue for filming secretly?

652
00:36:50,802 --> 00:36:52,270
Public sentiment is not on your side.

653
00:36:52,271 --> 00:36:54,972
We've barely stopped journalists wanting an interview.

654
00:36:55,572 --> 00:36:56,710
Why?

655
00:36:56,711 --> 00:36:59,411
Why did you do that to that doctor?

656
00:36:59,612 --> 00:37:00,782
That wasn't it.

657
00:37:01,141 --> 00:37:03,480
Don't make such a mistake.

658
00:37:03,481 --> 00:37:04,552
Darn it.

659
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:06,382
Darn it.

- the director here... - Sir.

665
00:37:18,831 --> 00:37:20,330
Please, sir.

666
00:37:20,331 --> 00:37:22,561
This place should just disappear!

667
00:37:22,601 --> 00:37:24,230
No, sir.

668
00:37:24,231 --> 00:37:27,140
I hope there are no such mistakes anymore!

669
00:37:27,141 --> 00:37:31,271
I don't think I've done anything wrong here.

670
00:37:31,472 --> 00:37:32,472
What do you want me to do here?

671
00:37:32,473 --> 00:37:34,581
Malpractice itself is a mistake.

672
00:37:35,541 --> 00:37:38,782
I haven't taken any legal actions so far.

673
00:37:38,811 --> 00:37:41,552
I even thought about just letting it go.

674
00:37:42,251 --> 00:37:43,422
But this is not right.

675
00:37:43,822 --> 00:37:46,561
Explain clearly why such a thing happened.

676
00:37:49,121 --> 00:37:50,331
Woo Ri,

677
00:37:51,262 --> 00:37:52,362
you came.

678
00:37:55,101 --> 00:37:57,101
What did you do at the hospital?

679
00:37:58,532 --> 00:38:00,001
- Did you see it? - Of course, I did.

680
00:38:00,541 --> 00:38:02,942
Everyone in the country did.

681
00:38:04,271 --> 00:38:05,411
Well, I just...

682
00:38:05,742 --> 00:38:08,140
wanted to help you.

683
00:38:08,141 --> 00:38:09,242
What help?

684
00:38:09,342 --> 00:38:12,411
Letting everyone know that I am pregnant, is helping me out?

685
00:38:13,222 --> 00:38:15,250
I told you not to get involved in my business.

686
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:17,491
I couldn't do anything for you for so long...

687
00:38:17,492 --> 00:38:18,721
so I wanted to do something.

688
00:38:18,722 --> 00:38:21,092
I told you to do nothing.

689
00:38:21,722 --> 00:38:23,961
You didn't want me to be born, did you?

690
00:38:25,161 --> 00:38:27,601
Isn't that why you keep saying such things about this baby?

691
00:38:28,132 --> 00:38:30,301
No, that's not it, Woo Ri.

692
00:38:30,302 --> 00:38:32,702
Stop interrupting my life after suddenly showing up like this.

693
00:38:33,271 --> 00:38:34,442
I...

694
00:38:34,541 --> 00:38:36,742
had a happy life without you.

695
00:38:37,411 --> 00:38:40,842
Mom and Grandma raised me well so far.

696
00:38:42,842 --> 00:38:44,012
You think buying me such a thing...

697
00:38:44,581 --> 00:38:46,081
is doing a father's duty?

698
00:38:46,751 --> 00:38:47,981
I don't need this.

699
00:38:49,351 --> 00:38:50,891
Don't you ever call me.

700
00:38:51,152 --> 00:38:52,652
Let's live as strangers...

701
00:38:52,692 --> 00:38:54,161
like before.

702
00:38:56,992 --> 00:38:59,032
Mr. Choi, why don't you make your response.

703
00:38:59,161 --> 00:39:00,631
What happened in that power-tripping video?

704
00:39:00,632 --> 00:39:01,961
- Please comment. - Sir.

705
00:39:02,461 --> 00:39:04,631
Why don't we talk privately? Let's leave here.

706
00:39:04,632 --> 00:39:06,902
I don't think this is a small matter.

707
00:39:07,501 --> 00:39:08,701
Who's that with him?

708
00:39:08,702 --> 00:39:10,172
Gosh, sir.

709
00:39:10,472 --> 00:39:11,710
Why are you doing this?

710
00:39:11,711 --> 00:39:13,710
- It's nobody. Just leave. - Who is that?

711
00:39:13,711 --> 00:39:16,011
Why are you meeting her discreetly?

712
00:39:16,012 --> 00:39:19,012
- Please leave. - Mr. Choi, please a word.

713
00:39:21,121 --> 00:39:22,152
Sir.

714
00:39:25,791 --> 00:39:26,960
Sir,

715
00:39:26,961 --> 00:39:28,661
your camera is so old.

716
00:39:29,061 --> 00:39:32,160
I'll get you a new one.

717
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:33,902
You think I'll let this go?

718
00:39:34,532 --> 00:39:37,001
I'm going to reveal all this.

719
00:39:37,172 --> 00:39:39,402
"A date with a young woman at the Han River."

720
00:39:39,771 --> 00:39:40,871
Sir,

721
00:39:41,302 --> 00:39:43,842
I don't care what article you write.

722
00:39:44,541 --> 00:39:48,411
But her face cannot be exposed.

723
00:39:49,181 --> 00:39:50,751
- Because... - Seoung Il,

724
00:39:51,952 --> 00:39:53,012
stop.

725
00:39:53,851 --> 00:39:55,222
Please, let me ask you for this favor.

726
00:39:56,722 --> 00:39:59,452
I'll give you an exclusive interview.

727
00:40:00,121 --> 00:40:01,492
Why don't you write an article with that?

728
00:40:02,621 --> 00:40:05,262
Her picture cannot be exposed.

729
00:40:05,731 --> 00:40:06,831
She...

730
00:40:11,431 --> 00:40:13,902
She can't get hurt because of me again.

731
00:40:31,822 --> 00:40:33,052
What are you doing here?

732
00:40:34,092 --> 00:40:35,391
Didn't you read the news article?

733
00:40:36,222 --> 00:40:37,331
What article?

734
00:40:38,391 --> 00:40:39,862
Choi Seoung Il's article.

735
00:40:49,902 --> 00:40:52,242
("Exclusive: Choi Seoung Il Had a Secret Daughter")

736
00:40:53,711 --> 00:40:55,810
What is this? This is a huge scandal.

737
00:40:55,811 --> 00:40:57,350
How fitting for the main character of a soap opera.

738
00:40:57,351 --> 00:40:58,611
He has a secret daughter?

739
00:40:58,612 --> 00:41:00,680
He must have had her when he was young.

740
00:41:00,681 --> 00:41:01,851
He must have had a wild life.

741
00:41:01,981 --> 00:41:03,652
He knew he would be criticized.

742
00:41:04,751 --> 00:41:07,461
To disclose that he had a daughter when he never got married,

743
00:41:10,061 --> 00:41:12,061
Duk Chil made a huge decision.

744
00:41:13,331 --> 00:41:16,632
Woo Ri. I'm sorry.

745
00:41:18,771 --> 00:41:20,072
I don't want your apology.

746
00:41:20,541 --> 00:41:22,001
Why did you lie to me?

747
00:41:22,371 --> 00:41:23,471
You lied to me that he was dead.

748
00:41:23,472 --> 00:41:25,911
He never got good grades or was ever athletic.

749
00:41:26,072 --> 00:41:29,342
Because of all the lies you told me, my life became a lie too.

750
00:41:30,681 --> 00:41:32,652
We were never going to see him again.

751
00:41:33,782 --> 00:41:35,580
I thought telling you...

752
00:41:35,581 --> 00:41:38,492
that he was dead was better than explaining all this.

753
00:41:40,322 --> 00:41:42,161
Just to make your life easier?

754
00:41:42,561 --> 00:41:44,431
Is that why you've been lying to me all my life?

755
00:41:47,762 --> 00:41:48,902
Yes.

756
00:41:49,802 --> 00:41:52,771
Duk Chil never got good grades or was ever athletic.

757
00:41:53,572 --> 00:41:55,271
He wasn't even that handsome.

758
00:41:56,041 --> 00:41:57,112
But...

759
00:41:58,371 --> 00:42:00,581
the affection he showed me was so pure.

760
00:42:02,481 --> 00:42:04,411
When I told him I was pregnant with you,

761
00:42:05,052 --> 00:42:06,981
he truly cared about only me.

762
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:12,592
Duk Chil's mother found out and came to me.

763
00:42:14,521 --> 00:42:16,291
"Stay away from Duk Chil."

764
00:42:17,262 --> 00:42:19,092
"You'll ruin his life."

765
00:42:20,461 --> 00:42:23,001
She treated me as if I was some kind of virus.

766
00:42:23,902 --> 00:42:26,771
She dragged me to a clinic to get the procedure done.

767
00:42:30,711 --> 00:42:32,472
I was scared, so I ran away.

768
00:42:35,882 --> 00:42:37,782
When I decided to have you,

769
00:42:39,112 --> 00:42:41,351
I swore I wouldn't see him.

770
00:42:42,922 --> 00:42:44,291
I never told anyone...

771
00:42:44,621 --> 00:42:47,461
who your father was. Not even to your grandma.

772
00:42:49,121 --> 00:42:51,331
So he was dead to me.

773
00:42:55,661 --> 00:42:57,532
Then you should've never let me find out.

774
00:42:59,632 --> 00:43:01,842
You shouldn't have told me about him.

775
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:05,040
If you didn't work with him for the same drama,

776
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:06,742
I would have never told you.

777
00:43:09,512 --> 00:43:12,251
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

778
00:43:25,092 --> 00:43:26,492
No.

779
00:43:27,862 --> 00:43:29,931
No, Mom. It's not your fault.

780
00:43:31,601 --> 00:43:32,902
I...

781
00:43:33,472 --> 00:43:35,871
I didn't know the full story.

782
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:39,541
It's my fault. I'm sorry.

783

00:44:22,851 --> 00:44:25,822
Hey, Woo Ri. What's up?

795
00:44:27,762 --> 00:44:28,862
Are you...

796
00:44:30,762 --> 00:44:32,331
okay?

797
00:44:36,731 --> 00:44:38,302
Gosh, of course.

798
00:44:39,331 --> 00:44:42,140
I had to overcome worse situations than this...

799
00:44:42,141 --> 00:44:44,411
to get to where I am now.

800
00:44:46,472 --> 00:44:49,081
I'm all right.

801
00:44:50,351 --> 00:44:53,112
And things will get better than this...

802
00:44:53,882 --> 00:44:55,621
because I have you now.

803
00:44:59,251 --> 00:45:01,291
I need to go and work out now.

804
00:45:01,362 --> 00:45:03,391
Let's talk later.

805
00:45:04,592 --> 00:45:07,362
Okay. Thank you for calling me.

806
00:45:22,311 --> 00:45:24,882
Woo Ri. This is amazing news!

807
00:45:24,952 --> 00:45:26,152
What?

808
00:45:26,282 --> 00:45:29,222
Isn't Seoung Il your father?

809
00:45:30,791 --> 00:45:31,791
How did you know that?

810
00:45:31,792 --> 00:45:34,060
Hey, the story went viral. How could I not know?

811
00:45:34,061 --> 00:45:36,161
He has a 29-year-old daughter who works as a writer.

812
00:45:36,362 --> 00:45:37,762
Isn't that you?

813
00:45:39,561 --> 00:45:40,632
Yes.

814
00:45:41,161 --> 00:45:43,161
What a relief that he's your father.

815
00:45:43,972 --> 00:45:45,730
What a relief!

816
00:45:45,731 --> 00:45:47,172
Is it?

817
00:45:47,702 --> 00:45:49,741
I suddenly have a dad now.

818
00:45:49,742 --> 00:45:52,011
Yes. It's a relief!

819
00:45:52,012 --> 00:45:53,471
He was never married,

820
00:45:53,472 --> 00:45:55,040
but because he has a secret daughter,

821
00:45:55,041 --> 00:45:56,241
everyone is badmouthing him.

822
00:45:56,242 --> 00:45:57,552
How is that a relief?

823
00:45:59,052 --> 00:46:00,722
Will he get kicked out of the drama?

824
00:46:01,282 --> 00:46:02,422
No.

825
00:46:03,052 --> 00:46:06,822
I accidentally impregnated Mr. Choi's daughter.

826
00:46:07,021 --> 00:46:08,091
I'm sorry.

827
00:46:08,092 --> 00:46:09,960
Gosh. I was really worried.

828
00:46:09,961 --> 00:46:12,960
The doctor posted a video to apologize to you.

829
00:46:12,961 --> 00:46:15,361
So everyone is on your side now.

830
00:46:15,362 --> 00:46:18,230
The doctor made the mistake. And Choi Seoung Il is the victim.

831
00:46:18,231 --> 00:46:20,031
He was a dad first before an actor.

832
00:46:20,032 --> 00:46:22,370
We had to stay neutral for this. You never know how it will end.

833
00:46:22,371 --> 00:46:24,172
Seoung Il was just being himself.

834
00:46:24,411 --> 00:46:27,481
Gosh. It would have been really bad for you if she didn't post this.

835
00:46:27,612 --> 00:46:29,782
- Your career could've ended. - Really?

836
00:46:30,711 --> 00:46:32,152
- Seoung Il. - Yes?

837
00:46:34,181 --> 00:46:35,881
Do you know how worried I've been?

838
00:46:35,882 --> 00:46:37,492
I can't believe Ms. Oh is your daughter.

839
00:46:37,621 --> 00:46:40,822
I can't believe Ms. Oh Woo Ri is your daughter!

840
00:46:41,222 --> 00:46:43,091
This is the best news ever!

841
00:46:43,092 --> 00:46:45,430
So I won't be kicked out of the drama, right?

842
00:46:45,431 --> 00:46:48,460
Nonsense! You've been getting many offers for commercials!

843
00:46:48,461 --> 00:46:50,000
You didn't check your social media?

844
00:46:50,001 --> 00:46:51,072
What?

(Followers: 964,000)

846
00:46:54,802 --> 00:46:56,802
- Gosh. - I have over one million followers.

847
00:46:58,572 --> 00:47:01,980
Hey, Mr. Kim. Who should I thank for this outcome?

848
00:47:01,981 --> 00:47:03,012
Oh, please.

849
00:47:03,342 --> 00:47:06,581
I worked really hard to control this situation.

850
00:47:07,952 --> 00:47:10,521
Of course, your contribution was the biggest.

851
00:47:10,592 --> 00:47:11,822
No.

852
00:47:12,992 --> 00:47:14,161
This is...

853
00:47:14,961 --> 00:47:17,291
all thanks to my daughter, Woo Ri.

854
00:47:20,262 --> 00:47:21,831
I'm back.

855
00:47:21,931 --> 00:47:24,572
Woo Ri. Are you just getting home?

856
00:47:25,172 --> 00:47:27,371
- Are you done with your work? - Yes.

857
00:47:28,172 --> 00:47:29,871
Grandma, you haven't had dinner. Right?

858
00:47:30,001 --> 00:47:31,770
I'm hungry. Let's have dinner.

859
00:47:31,771 --> 00:47:34,341
Is that so? Should I cook a delicious meal for you?

860
00:47:34,342 --> 00:47:36,810
- Yes! - I want something spicy.

861
00:47:36,811 --> 00:47:39,580
All right. You have a spoonful of gochujang.

862
00:47:39,581 --> 00:47:40,581
What?

863
00:47:40,582 --> 00:47:42,422
I want something spicy too.

864
00:47:42,782 --> 00:47:44,250
Octopuses are in season now.

865
00:47:44,251 --> 00:47:46,221
How about spicy stir-fried octopus?

866
00:47:46,222 --> 00:47:48,020
- Sounds good! - Is she the only one who will eat?

867
00:47:48,021 --> 00:47:50,491
What about your own daughter? Am I not going to eat?

868
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:51,830
- What am I going to do then? - Whatever.

869
00:47:51,831 --> 00:47:53,091
You do whatever you want.

870
00:47:53,092 --> 00:47:55,701
Goodness. Did you adopt me or something?

871
00:47:55,702 --> 00:47:57,632
Yes, I did. So what?

872
00:48:16,021 --> 00:48:18,722
Woo Ri. I'm here. You're all right.

873
00:48:34,072 --> 00:48:35,342
Father,

874
00:48:35,902 --> 00:48:38,910
I did my best to change his mind about the divorce.

875
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:41,641
I even did something I shouldn't have done.

876
00:48:42,282 --> 00:48:45,251
But I don't think there's anything I can do now.

877
00:48:45,452 --> 00:48:47,452
I'm really sorry.

878
00:48:50,351 --> 00:48:52,651
Don't cry. Stop crying!

879
00:48:52,652 --> 00:48:55,261
You know what I did? I drove him crazy...

880
00:48:55,262 --> 00:48:57,231
with my tears and cries.

881
00:48:57,461 --> 00:48:59,031
Mom, aren't you proud of me?

882
00:48:59,032 --> 00:49:01,101
But still. That was too soon.

883
00:49:01,762 --> 00:49:05,132
Your father-in-law already mentioned the Star Cafe building?

884
00:49:05,532 --> 00:49:08,441
Yes. If you give me a good plan like this,

885
00:49:08,442 --> 00:49:10,512
I will push forward no matter what.

886
00:49:11,911 --> 00:49:15,242
Ms. Lee. You have a visitor.

887
00:49:15,541 --> 00:49:16,580
Who?

888
00:49:16,581 --> 00:49:18,851
He said you guys studied together in Sweden.

889
00:49:19,481 --> 00:49:23,621
He studied with me in Sweden?

890
00:49:29,822 --> 00:49:32,192
Who are you?

891
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:38,902
Mal Ja. Your husband is here.

892
00:49:40,271 --> 00:49:42,101
What are you doing here?

893
00:49:43,101 --> 00:49:44,241
Did you break out of prison?

894
00:49:44,242 --> 00:49:47,112
What are you talking about? A nice guy like me wouldn't do that.

895
00:49:47,282 --> 00:49:49,180
They let me out early since I behaved well.

896
00:49:49,181 --> 00:49:51,612
They released me on parole.

897
00:49:54,552 --> 00:49:56,980
Get out of here. Don't ever show up in front of me.

898
00:49:56,981 --> 00:49:58,092
Come on.

899
00:49:59,052 --> 00:50:01,161
This is no way to treat me when we just reunited.

900
00:50:01,961 --> 00:50:04,132
Have you been too busy living as Lee Ma Ri, a rich family's wife?

901
00:50:04,331 --> 00:50:06,532
Did you forget that you're married to me as Lee Mal Ja?

902
00:50:07,501 --> 00:50:09,061
Are you threatening me?

903
00:50:09,101 --> 00:50:10,132
Threaten you?

904
00:50:11,371 --> 00:50:12,672
Gosh. That sounds scary.

905
00:50:13,702 --> 00:50:16,802
Only thugs like your mother would threaten people.

906
00:50:20,472 --> 00:50:22,541
Hey. Hold on. Stop it.

907
00:50:22,842 --> 00:50:24,882
- Stop it. - Come on.

908
00:50:25,911 --> 00:50:27,922
This should be enough to knock some sense into him.

909
00:50:29,782 --> 00:50:30,850
Right?

910
00:50:30,851 --> 00:50:33,152
Did you forget what you did to my mother's legs?

911
00:50:46,032 --> 00:50:47,172
Come on.

912
00:50:49,371 --> 00:50:52,442
So I got out after I paid for what I did. Okay?

913
00:50:53,981 --> 00:50:55,311
We're even now. Right?

914
00:50:55,981 --> 00:50:57,711
I want to start afresh too.

915
00:50:58,351 --> 00:51:00,552
Since you're doing well, help me out. Okay?

916
00:51:01,981 --> 00:51:03,121
I just need one million dollars.

917
00:51:05,291 --> 00:51:06,621
Do you think I'm crazy?

918
00:51:07,192 --> 00:51:08,561
Why would I give you money?

919
00:51:08,791 --> 00:51:10,631
You spent years setting up your identity.

920
00:51:10,632 --> 00:51:12,791
If I talk, all of your hard work would go to waste.

921
00:51:13,561 --> 00:51:14,831
I think my price is reasonable.

922
00:51:17,132 --> 00:51:18,731
I'm here to say hello today.

923
00:51:19,601 --> 00:51:20,702
Gosh.

924
00:51:25,641 --> 00:51:26,811
See you around.

925
00:51:38,021 --> 00:51:39,152
All right.

926
00:51:46,092 --> 00:51:48,731
Get in. I'm on a stakeout now. Come on, get in.

927
00:51:50,001 --> 00:51:51,172
Get in now!

928
00:51:55,371 --> 00:51:57,641
So you found more of Shin Mi Young's belongings.

929
00:52:08,152 --> 00:52:10,382
Is that all of it?

930
00:52:10,992 --> 00:52:12,722
You asked me to bring you anything I found.

931
00:52:15,222 --> 00:52:17,431
Sure. Okay.

932
00:52:18,791 --> 00:52:20,231
Right.

933
00:52:22,501 --> 00:52:23,661
Detective Lee.

934
00:52:24,132 --> 00:52:25,402
Let me ask you something.

935
00:52:26,632 --> 00:52:28,402
Are you investigating my hospital...

936
00:52:30,641 --> 00:52:32,811
on your own based on your personal feelings toward me?

937
00:52:32,972 --> 00:52:34,842
Because my father is the chairman of the hospital?

938
00:52:34,981 --> 00:52:36,040
What did you say?

939
00:52:36,041 --> 00:52:38,411
Are you taking your anger out on me about Ms. Oh's pregnancy?

940
00:52:40,251 --> 00:52:41,351
Are you?

941
00:52:44,521 --> 00:52:45,992
Gosh. This is crazy.

942
00:52:46,722 --> 00:52:48,262
I can't tell you the details.

943
00:52:48,722 --> 00:52:50,390
But I'm investigating because the hospital might be...

944
00:52:50,391 --> 00:52:51,461
connected to crimes.

945
00:52:53,231 --> 00:52:54,331
I see.

946
00:52:54,461 --> 00:52:55,802
I hope you close the case fast,

947
00:52:56,302 --> 00:52:59,672
so the patients at my hospital won't feel uncomfortable.

948
00:52:59,802 --> 00:53:00,871
Bye.

949
00:53:02,001 --> 00:53:04,512
- Seriously. - Hey. Be careful. Gosh.

950
00:53:04,942 --> 00:53:06,041
Come on.

951
00:53:07,172 --> 00:53:10,512
He didn't even bring me important leads. Seriously.

952
00:53:12,282 --> 00:53:14,382
I mean, isn't this obvious?

953
00:53:15,121 --> 00:53:17,652
How will I find any evidence from items like this?

She's her foster daughter. They were very close.

970

We thought she had no relatives because she was orphaned.

We totally missed it.

972

We found her car.

973
00:54:15,342 --> 00:54:17,041
This is a secluded area, so she couldn't have gotten far.

Between the leaves

996
00:56:11,862 --> 00:56:13,430
A blue street light

997
00:56:13,431 --> 00:56:15,361
Isn't that her? Is that Woo Ri?

998
00:56:15,362 --> 00:56:16,901
- It's not her. - It's not?

999
00:56:16,902 --> 00:56:18,601
No. She was right there.

1000
00:56:19,532 --> 00:56:21,302
- Where is she? - Look closely.

1001
00:56:21,601 --> 00:56:23,270
- She's not there either. No? - No.

1002
00:56:23,271 --> 00:56:24,811
Where is she?

1003
00:56:25,472 --> 00:56:26,710
My goodness.

1004
00:56:26,711 --> 00:56:28,641
They're all about the same height. I can't find her.

1005
00:56:29,041 --> 00:56:30,911
Hey, she's all the way in the back.

1006
00:56:31,081 --> 00:56:32,951
- Check the back. Yes. - All the way in the back?

1007
00:56:32,952 --> 00:56:34,151
- Her. - Where?

1008
00:56:34,152 --> 00:56:35,750
- That's Woo Ri. Right? - Gosh.

1009
00:56:35,751 --> 00:56:37,790
- Yes. - That's Woo Ri.

1010
00:56:37,791 --> 00:56:40,652
- There's Woo Ri. - Film her.

1011
00:56:40,751 --> 00:56:45,561
A wave of people

1012
00:56:46,461 --> 00:56:50,461
- Is summer already gone? - Is summer already gone?

1013
00:56:51,231 --> 00:56:55,501
- A breeze already hugs the street - A breeze already hugs the street

1014
00:56:55,842 --> 00:57:00,411
- Seasons come and go so easily - Seasons come and go so easily

1015
00:57:03,942 --> 00:57:06,711
- But - But

1016
00:57:08,652 --> 00:57:12,092
- How far - How far

1017
00:57:13,492 --> 00:57:20,632
- Must we go around? - Must we go around?

1018
00:57:23,931 --> 00:57:27,331
- A soft star is seen - A soft star is seen

1019
00:57:27,742 --> 00:57:32,371
- Between the leaves - Between the leaves

1020
00:57:33,442 --> 00:57:36,581
- And your small dream - And your small dream

1021
00:57:37,141 --> 00:57:42,052
- Is seen under the stars - Is seen under the stars

1022
00:58:27,262 --> 00:58:28,501
- What about Raphael? - I see.

1023
00:58:30,061 --> 00:58:31,600
I had to clean up afterward.

1024
00:58:31,601 --> 00:58:32,771
- I see. - Okay.

1025
00:58:33,532 --> 00:58:35,541
- Be careful. - Okay.

1026
00:58:35,641 --> 00:58:36,701
Go for it.

1027
00:58:36,702 --> 00:58:37,971
You should debut as a singer.

1028
00:58:37,972 --> 00:58:39,641
Wasn't she amazing?

1029
00:59:04,501 --> 00:59:09,202
(Special appearance by Hwangwoo Seul Hye)

1030
00:59:23,882 --> 00:59:26,791
(Woori the Virgin)

1031
00:59:26,851 --> 00:59:28,160
It's about Kang Jae.

1032
00:59:28,161 --> 00:59:29,620
He must have a lot on his plate.

1033
00:59:29,621 --> 00:59:30,921
Did you pay for it, Raphael?

1034
00:59:30,922 --> 00:59:32,430
Of course. I invited you out.

1035
00:59:32,431 --> 00:59:36,061
Let's not hide anything or lie to each other. Okay?

1036
00:59:36,161 --> 00:59:37,731
I want us to try again.

1037
00:59:37,802 --> 00:59:39,071
What if it doesn't work out?

1038
00:59:39,072 --> 00:59:40,971
My daughter will be hurt twice.

1039
00:59:40,972 --> 00:59:43,141
I can't gamble with my daughter's heart.

1040
00:59:43,641 --> 00:59:46,911
Your husband should watch this touching moment too.

1041
00:59:47,112 --> 00:59:48,311
Let's talk inside.

1042
00:59:48,681 --> 00:59:50,882
He always picked up my calls.

1043
00:59:51,012 --> 00:59:53,410
Lee Kang Jae was the one who put on a show.

1044
00:59:53,411 --> 00:59:55,822
You didn't know your boyfriend helped me, right?

1045
00:59:55,922 --> 00:59:57,051
Woo Ri.

1046
00:59:57,052 --> 00:59:58,222
Why did you lie to me?

1047
01:00:02,422 --> 01:00:06,632
