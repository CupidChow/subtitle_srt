00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:36,623
(Episode 3)

10
00:00:49,934 --> 00:00:51,902
Pregnancy and motherhood...

11
00:00:51,903 --> 00:00:55,403
play a big part in a woman's life.

12
00:00:55,604 --> 00:00:58,942
Definitely. Giving birth is a massive undertaking.

13
00:00:58,943 --> 00:01:01,243
Some women struggle to return to work after giving birth,

14
00:01:01,244 --> 00:01:03,082
and some people end up quitting their jobs.

15
00:01:03,083 --> 00:01:04,243
It's a social issue.

16
00:01:04,244 --> 00:01:06,213
Right. They talk about it often on the news.

17
00:01:06,214 --> 00:01:09,054
There's a novel about it. What was the title?

18
00:01:09,783 --> 00:01:12,093
I don't want to lose control of my life.

19
00:01:14,724 --> 00:01:17,464
Woo Ri, does this mean you've changed your mind?

20
00:01:17,964 --> 00:01:21,402
I want to prove to myself that life can still be the same...

21
00:01:21,403 --> 00:01:23,503
even after going through pregnancy and giving birth.

22
00:01:25,903 --> 00:01:29,074
Even married couples are hesitant to have kids these days, you know.

23
00:01:29,503 --> 00:01:33,142
Having a baby is much harder than you think. A baby is...

24
00:01:33,143 --> 00:01:35,983
No. I'm not going to call it a baby anymore.

25
00:01:39,153 --> 00:01:40,982
Yes. Let's call it "Mallet".

26
00:01:40,983 --> 00:01:43,083
"Mallet"? Will that be the baby bump nickname?

27
00:01:43,084 --> 00:01:46,023
No, let's just call it like that. There's no reason behind it.

28
00:01:46,024 --> 00:01:48,563
I'll call it "Mallet" because I don't want to call it a baby.

29
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:52,093
I've made up my mind.

30
00:01:53,093 --> 00:01:55,763
I'm heading out to meet that couple.

31
00:02:06,414 --> 00:02:07,474
No Man Chul.

32
00:02:09,944 --> 00:02:11,013
No Man Chul!

33
00:02:19,954 --> 00:02:21,264
What are you two doing right now?

34
00:02:39,514 --> 00:02:41,613
Woo Ri, that must've given you quite the scare.

35
00:02:41,614 --> 00:02:44,144
- Are you all right? - Yes, I'm fine.

36
00:02:44,913 --> 00:02:46,912
You still need to interview me, right?

37
00:02:46,913 --> 00:02:49,823
Well, would you like to go see a doctor first?

38
00:02:49,954 --> 00:02:51,823
The witness interview can wait until tomorrow.

39
00:02:51,994 --> 00:02:54,662
Kang Jae, I'll go see my doctor.

40
00:02:54,663 --> 00:02:55,794
Okay, Woo Ri.

41
00:02:56,123 --> 00:02:57,662
I can't leave while they inspect the scene.

42
00:02:57,663 --> 00:02:59,994
Right. I'll just go alone.

43
00:03:00,964 --> 00:03:02,502
I'll take her to the doctor.

44
00:03:02,503 --> 00:03:04,703
No, it's okay. I can go by myself.

45
00:03:04,704 --> 00:03:07,002
I'll come with you. We can leave now, right?

46
00:03:07,003 --> 00:03:10,274
Sure. Then please come to the precinct with your wife tomorrow.

47
00:03:11,244 --> 00:03:12,813
Sure, I'll help in every way I can.

48
00:03:13,313 --> 00:03:14,942
Help them tidy up.

49
00:03:14,943 --> 00:03:16,783
And try to calm the patients down.

50
00:03:16,984 --> 00:03:18,054
Okay.

51
00:03:23,153 --> 00:03:25,153
Ms. Lee. Your meeting is over, right?

52
00:03:25,323 --> 00:03:26,593
- Yes. - This way, please.

53
00:03:28,294 --> 00:03:30,394
Kang Jae, you were the one who found him.

54
00:03:30,623 --> 00:03:32,063
Did you notice anything?

55
00:03:32,364 --> 00:03:34,363
The aorta was cut with a scalpel.

56
00:03:34,364 --> 00:03:36,003
He bled out and died within 30 seconds.

57
00:03:36,334 --> 00:03:37,972
It's exactly the same as Chairman Kim's MO.

58
00:03:37,973 --> 00:03:40,274
Chairman Kim isn't the only one who stabs his targets in the neck.

59
00:03:40,403 --> 00:03:42,204
Besides, there are scalpels everywhere in the hospital.

60
00:03:42,373 --> 00:03:44,102
Investigate objectively without bias.

61
00:03:44,103 --> 00:03:46,473
Consider all possibilities and comb through everything.

62
00:03:47,744 --> 00:03:51,114
The hard drive for security cameras is gone.

63
00:03:51,153 --> 00:03:52,153
What?

64
00:03:52,154 --> 00:03:54,882
The forensics team hasn't found anything yet.

65
00:03:54,883 --> 00:03:56,023
This won't be an easy case.

66
00:03:56,024 --> 00:03:59,253
Goodness. It must be someone who knows the hospital inside out.

67
00:03:59,693 --> 00:04:03,424
First, let's find out who had hostile relationships with him.

68
00:04:03,924 --> 00:04:07,192
Hey, Detective Kang. Tell Forensics to wrap it up.

69
00:04:07,193 --> 00:04:10,403
Do you remember seeing anyone suspicious at the scene today?

70
00:04:14,704 --> 00:04:18,443
Hello, thank you for visiting...

71
00:04:18,813 --> 00:04:20,643
You must've been so scared.

72
00:04:21,484 --> 00:04:23,784
Gosh, my heart is still pounding.

73
00:04:26,713 --> 00:04:29,453
Yes, it was scary.

74
00:04:30,054 --> 00:04:32,794
But the thing is, I came here to talk to you about something.

75
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:36,924
Right. What happened yesterday? Is everything okay?

76
00:04:38,193 --> 00:04:42,164
I never thought I'd say this,

77
00:04:43,404 --> 00:04:46,434
but I decided to keep Mallet.

78
00:04:46,503 --> 00:04:49,844
Sorry? Keep what?

79
00:04:51,373 --> 00:04:54,413
Oh, sorry. The baby. I'm going to keep the baby.

80
00:04:54,414 --> 00:04:56,812
What? Why?

81
00:04:56,813 --> 00:04:58,753
Sorry? What do you mean, why?

82
00:04:59,354 --> 00:05:02,083
Oh, don't get me wrong.

83
00:05:02,623 --> 00:05:04,354
It's such a big decision for you.

84
00:05:04,654 --> 00:05:06,193
Why did you suddenly make that decision?

85
00:05:08,463 --> 00:05:11,494
There's no special reason.

86
00:05:12,594 --> 00:05:16,104
I'm just so grateful that I was brought into this world.

87
00:05:17,404 --> 00:05:18,474
What?

88
00:05:19,734 --> 00:05:23,844
Oh, I'm Catholic. Every life is precious, you know.

89
00:05:24,643 --> 00:05:27,143
Right, I see.

90
00:05:30,443 --> 00:05:32,854
Do you not want the baby?

91
00:05:33,054 --> 00:05:34,382
I heard you couldn't make another...

92
00:05:34,383 --> 00:05:36,984
I do. I really want the baby.

93
00:05:37,424 --> 00:05:41,294
I just didn't think that you'd decide to keep the baby.

94
00:05:41,994 --> 00:05:44,523
But you're working at the moment. If you suddenly get pregnant...

95
00:05:45,494 --> 00:05:47,903
The drama will end in three months' time anyway,

96
00:05:47,904 --> 00:05:50,104
so I'm just going to stay home and take it easy after that.

97
00:05:51,164 --> 00:05:53,573
I wanted to write a drama on my own,

98
00:05:53,804 --> 00:05:55,073
so this works out.

99
00:05:55,643 --> 00:05:57,443
I'll give it a shot this time.

100
00:05:57,744 --> 00:05:59,114
Oh, I see.

101
00:05:59,713 --> 00:06:02,684
I'll bill you for my medical and other expenses.

102
00:06:03,044 --> 00:06:04,654
That will be enough.

103
00:06:05,213 --> 00:06:07,554
I don't need the money I was offered the other day.

104
00:06:07,924 --> 00:06:09,283
Don't worry about it.

105
00:06:09,284 --> 00:06:10,323
What?

106
00:06:10,753 --> 00:06:12,823
Money? Did she offer you money?

107
00:06:14,023 --> 00:06:15,063
Yes.

108
00:06:15,924 --> 00:06:17,094
Goodness.

109
00:06:19,094 --> 00:06:21,333
She can be really crude at times.

110
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:24,533
I apologize on her behalf.

111
00:06:24,534 --> 00:06:25,734
It's okay.

112
00:06:26,203 --> 00:06:27,503
I understand how desperate she must've felt.

113
00:06:28,474 --> 00:06:31,203
If you need anything, just call me.

114
00:06:31,744 --> 00:06:34,043
This must've been a very difficult decision for you.

115
00:06:34,044 --> 00:06:36,383
I don't know how to thank you.

116
00:06:37,213 --> 00:06:39,154
You don't need to thank me.

117
00:06:40,013 --> 00:06:42,023
I made this decision for my own sake.

118
00:06:48,724 --> 00:06:50,562
The test results look good.

119
00:06:50,563 --> 00:06:52,132
You've been sleeping well, right?

120
00:06:52,133 --> 00:06:54,263
- Yes. - Do you get morning sickness?

121
00:06:54,434 --> 00:06:56,133
No, not yet.

122
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:00,173
I'm glad...

123
00:07:00,174 --> 00:07:03,174
that both you and the baby are healthy.

124
00:07:03,244 --> 00:07:05,044
Yes, me too.

125
00:07:06,813 --> 00:07:09,143
I feel so frazzled today.

126
00:07:10,713 --> 00:07:14,783
Actually, there was something...

127
00:07:14,784 --> 00:07:16,583
I wanted to ask you and your wife in person.

128
00:07:16,924 --> 00:07:18,154
What is it?

129
00:07:19,753 --> 00:07:22,123
I grew up without a father.

130
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:25,934
Of course, I'm so grateful to my mom and grandmother,

131
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:31,734
but I want this baby to grow up in the perfect family.

132
00:07:31,974 --> 00:07:33,433
Having everything it needs...

133
00:07:33,434 --> 00:07:35,143
and receiving lots of love from Mom and Dad.

134
00:07:35,273 --> 00:07:37,073
I want the baby to be happier than anybody else.

135
00:07:37,773 --> 00:07:41,383
I made this decision because I trust that you and your wife can do that.

136
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:45,313
Right? You will do that, right?

137
00:07:45,414 --> 00:07:47,114
Well, that's...

138
00:07:47,984 --> 00:07:49,784
I told you that I wanted a divorce.

139
00:07:49,823 --> 00:07:52,794
Well, I don't want a divorce.

140
00:07:57,724 --> 00:08:01,434
When you told me you'd decided to do this, it didn't feel real.

141
00:08:01,804 --> 00:08:05,503
It's only hitting me now.

142
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:08,703
I feel the weight of responsibility on my shoulders.

143
00:08:08,904 --> 00:08:11,674
The perfect family for the baby.

144
00:08:11,914 --> 00:08:14,744
Yes, of course. Sure thing!

145
00:08:17,313 --> 00:08:18,854
Wow, yes!

146
00:08:19,614 --> 00:08:22,623
So about the baby, she decided to keep it.

147
00:08:24,554 --> 00:08:27,393
Good. That's great.

148
00:08:27,794 --> 00:08:29,724
I told you. Money solves all problems.

149
00:08:29,994 --> 00:08:33,363
But the two million dollars... She won't ask for all of it, right?

150
00:08:33,364 --> 00:08:35,863
- Let's knock off a little. - We should, right?

151
00:08:35,864 --> 00:08:38,073
How much will you knock off for your own happiness?

152
00:08:38,174 --> 00:08:41,233
Hey, did you talk to her? The more, the better.

153
00:08:42,874 --> 00:08:45,174
I scrapped the whole thing...

154
00:08:45,473 --> 00:08:47,572
and made it zero. Happy now?

155
00:08:47,573 --> 00:08:49,943
You... Well done!

156
00:08:51,213 --> 00:08:52,684
Be embarrassed of yourself.

157
00:08:52,853 --> 00:08:54,823
You see, money doesn't solve everything.

158
00:08:55,184 --> 00:08:57,023
She's offended that she was offered money.

159
00:08:57,024 --> 00:08:59,294
She made the decision because she believes every life is precious.

160
00:08:59,453 --> 00:09:00,992
I bet you can't wrap your head around it.

161
00:09:00,993 --> 00:09:03,093
She doesn't want the money?

162
00:09:03,424 --> 00:09:05,692
Forget it, then. Why would you criticize me?

163
00:09:05,693 --> 00:09:08,264
- Goodness. - Hey, stop.

164
00:09:12,174 --> 00:09:14,072
Once word about the stabbing death spreads,

165
00:09:14,073 --> 00:09:15,544
the hospital will go out of business.

166
00:09:16,603 --> 00:09:17,942
Keep the media out!

167
00:09:17,943 --> 00:09:19,742
This morning, a murder took place...

168
00:09:19,743 --> 00:09:21,643
at a large medical foundation in Gangnam...

169
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,442
that is famous for plastic surgery procedures.

170
00:09:23,443 --> 00:09:25,883
The victim, No, is a man in his 20s.

171
00:09:25,884 --> 00:09:28,423
He was found stabbed to death in an elevator at the hospital.

172
00:09:28,424 --> 00:09:30,783
So, No Man Chul is dead.

173
00:09:30,784 --> 00:09:32,722
It is said that he worked at the hospital.

174
00:09:32,723 --> 00:09:34,092
He died at the scene...

175
00:09:34,093 --> 00:09:36,362
- immediately after being stabbed. - Mom.

176
00:09:36,363 --> 00:09:37,793
Did you kill him?

177
00:09:37,794 --> 00:09:39,492
What am I, Professor X?

178
00:09:39,493 --> 00:09:41,833
How could I kill someone sitting in my wheelchair?

179
00:09:42,404 --> 00:09:44,164
Did you hire someone to do it?

180
00:09:44,904 --> 00:09:48,033
The police will investigate all employees of the foundation...

181
00:09:48,034 --> 00:09:50,044
as well as those connected to the victim.

182
00:09:51,203 --> 00:09:54,113
You know, those who devote their lives to their children.

183
00:09:54,843 --> 00:09:56,313
I always thought they were so pathetic.

184
00:09:57,843 --> 00:09:59,713
"They must have nothing else going for them."

185
00:10:00,654 --> 00:10:04,082
"That's why they want to ride their children's coattails."

186
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:05,453
I always thought that.

187
00:10:08,264 --> 00:10:09,563
But you see,

188
00:10:11,764 --> 00:10:15,134
ever since this happened to my leg because of you,

189
00:10:16,363 --> 00:10:18,573
your success has been my sole focus...

190
00:10:19,374 --> 00:10:20,934
and my sole devotion.

191
00:10:22,044 --> 00:10:23,904
If I can make you successful,

192
00:10:24,674 --> 00:10:26,213
I don't care who dies,

193
00:10:26,613 --> 00:10:28,044
even if that's me.

194
00:10:29,784 --> 00:10:31,144
I really don't care.

195
00:10:34,054 --> 00:10:35,184
So?

196
00:10:35,453 --> 00:10:36,684
Did you kill him?

197
00:10:38,453 --> 00:10:40,394
If I get caught, I'll be the one getting arrested.

198
00:10:40,493 --> 00:10:41,722
You'll be fine, my princess.

199
00:10:41,723 --> 00:10:44,393
- Mom! - I didn't do it!

200
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:46,363
I did think I should kill him if he got in the way,

201
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:47,733
but it wasn't me.

202
00:10:50,304 --> 00:10:52,202
Right? It wasn't you, right?

203
00:10:52,203 --> 00:10:54,034
There are times when the universe looks out for you.

204
00:10:54,943 --> 00:10:56,044
What?

205
00:10:56,174 --> 00:10:57,543
You couldn't get pregnant,

206
00:10:57,544 --> 00:11:00,613
but a stranger shows up pregnant and says she'll have the baby.

207
00:11:00,914 --> 00:11:03,013
There was a jerk whom you wanted gone,

208
00:11:03,014 --> 00:11:04,243
and he dropped dead.

209
00:11:04,384 --> 00:11:05,554
You see, it means...

210
00:11:06,983 --> 00:11:10,754
the universe is focusing its energy on you.

211
00:11:16,294 --> 00:11:18,093
I'm home.

212
00:11:18,693 --> 00:11:20,394
Did you meet the couple? What did they say?

213
00:11:21,294 --> 00:11:22,862
They're very grateful.

214
00:11:22,863 --> 00:11:25,434
How come you look so flustered? Did something happen?

215
00:11:26,304 --> 00:11:28,674
No, it was just a long day. That's all.

216
00:11:29,103 --> 00:11:30,342
I should get some rest.

217
00:11:30,343 --> 00:11:31,504
Woo Ri.

218
00:11:31,674 --> 00:11:33,613
I thought about it all day.

219
00:11:34,073 --> 00:11:37,044
Giving your baby away won't be as easy as it sounds.

220
00:11:39,184 --> 00:11:41,253
Mom, stop calling it a baby.

221
00:11:41,254 --> 00:11:42,483
It's Mallet.

222
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,453
I won't change my mind.

223
00:11:44,754 --> 00:11:47,492
That couple really wants Mallet.

224
00:11:47,493 --> 00:11:49,663
And they're well-off, so Mallet will be happy.

225
00:11:49,664 --> 00:11:52,093
- We have nothing to worry about. - Well, the thing is...

226
00:11:54,264 --> 00:11:56,134
Who is it? Just answer it.

227
00:11:56,363 --> 00:11:58,904
This is about my daughter's life. Who cares about a phone call?

228
00:11:59,473 --> 00:12:02,044
Woo Ri, I understand why you made such a decision,

229
00:12:02,443 --> 00:12:04,843
but the reality is very different from what you think.

230
00:12:06,743 --> 00:12:08,743
Hey! Either answer the call or turn off your phone.

231
00:12:14,613 --> 00:12:15,753
Are you a stalker?

232
00:12:15,754 --> 00:12:18,452
I didn't pick up because I couldn't. Must you keep calling me?

233
00:12:18,453 --> 00:12:19,723
Are you free later?

234
00:12:20,424 --> 00:12:22,294
I want to talk to you in person.

235
00:12:22,524 --> 00:12:25,134
- I'm busy. - Come on, Eun Ran.

236
00:12:25,493 --> 00:12:27,393
I can't even eat...

237
00:12:27,394 --> 00:12:29,503
or sleep.

238
00:12:29,504 --> 00:12:31,333
You see, I've lived like that my whole life.

239
00:12:31,904 --> 00:12:33,733
I told you that my kid is going through something.

240
00:12:34,274 --> 00:12:35,573
I'll tell you once things get sorted out.

241
00:12:36,144 --> 00:12:37,404
Wait patiently.

242
00:12:37,904 --> 00:12:39,674
I'll call you, so stop calling me.

243
00:12:40,473 --> 00:12:41,884
Wait, Eun Ran!

244
00:12:46,453 --> 00:12:47,583
Seriously...

245
00:12:48,113 --> 00:12:51,323
Does she not see how much I care about her?

246
00:12:54,394 --> 00:12:55,563
Gosh, why...

247
00:13:00,434 --> 00:13:01,804
Eun Ran!

248
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,703
Ms. Yu.

249
00:13:04,863 --> 00:13:08,203
You say you have meetings, but all you do is get facial treatments.

250
00:13:08,674 --> 00:13:10,373
When will you work on the script?

251
00:13:10,374 --> 00:13:12,044
The director will yell at us.

252
00:13:16,144 --> 00:13:17,414
She does this all the time.

253
00:13:32,093 --> 00:13:33,993
Hey, I told you that you should get it done too.

254
00:13:42,943 --> 00:13:44,942
With that handsome face, what do you expect?

255
00:13:44,943 --> 00:13:46,144
I knew it.

256
00:13:46,514 --> 00:13:48,044
He has a heck of a nickname.

257
00:13:49,684 --> 00:13:51,442
What is his nickname?

258
00:13:51,443 --> 00:13:52,582
Actress Hunter.

259
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:55,083
He only dates actresses, one after another.

260
00:13:55,554 --> 00:13:56,924
But he's married.

261
00:13:57,624 --> 00:13:59,592
As if he cares.

262
00:13:59,593 --> 00:14:01,353
He just does whatever he wants.

263
00:14:02,093 --> 00:14:05,693
I heard lots of rumours about him.

264
00:14:07,233 --> 00:14:08,332
What kind of rumours?

265
00:14:08,333 --> 00:14:10,004
There were articles about it. Look it up.

Must you do this in front of the patients?

Take them to the meeting room.

00:16:28,203 --> 00:16:29,304
Sure.

301
00:16:29,473 --> 00:16:30,644
Let's go to the meeting room.

Doesn't he look awfully calm considering his employee died?

310
00:16:54,164 --> 00:16:56,304
You should look into him.

311
00:16:56,363 --> 00:16:58,203
I'm already on it. Don't worry.

312
00:16:58,874 --> 00:17:00,832
Look at you, talking like a detective.

313
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:02,743
No, that guy...

314
00:17:06,674 --> 00:17:07,914
I think he's a philanderer.

315
00:17:09,114 --> 00:17:10,314
People call him "Actress Hunter".

316
00:17:10,513 --> 00:17:12,753
What? That's what you want me to look into?

317
00:17:13,283 --> 00:17:15,012
That's his personal life.

318
00:17:15,013 --> 00:17:17,253
I saw something fishy with my own eyes.

319
00:17:17,324 --> 00:17:19,252
I can't send Mallet to someone like that.

320
00:17:19,253 --> 00:17:21,154
That's not why I made the decision.

321
00:17:21,453 --> 00:17:22,624
"Mallet"?

322
00:17:23,263 --> 00:17:24,963
I've decided to call the baby like that from now on.

323
00:17:25,993 --> 00:17:27,093
Kang Jae.

324
00:17:27,094 --> 00:17:29,803
Can you look into him, Kang Jae?

325
00:17:30,033 --> 00:17:32,373
I heard he caused a DUI accident once...

326
00:17:32,374 --> 00:17:34,472
and even threw a drug party.

327
00:17:34,473 --> 00:17:36,242
Can you please find out...

328
00:17:36,243 --> 00:17:37,703
if he has a criminal record? Please?

329
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:40,513
Just because I'm a cop, it doesn't mean I can do stuff like that.

If I'm caught, I'll get fired.

331
00:17:42,213 --> 00:17:43,943
Then what should I do?

332
00:17:44,614 --> 00:17:46,814
I can't send Mallet to a dysfunctional family.

333
00:17:47,354 --> 00:17:49,752
The wife desperately wants to have a baby.

334
00:17:49,753 --> 00:17:51,453
And I thought she would be a great mother.

335
00:17:58,124 --> 00:17:59,364
Woo Ri.

336
00:17:59,394 --> 00:18:01,894
I said you'd run into problems you had never even thought of.

337
00:18:02,404 --> 00:18:04,263
You'll run into more unexpected issues.

338
00:18:05,674 --> 00:18:06,733
I suggest you rethink...

339
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:08,943
No, I can't.

340
00:18:09,574 --> 00:18:11,803
I told Mom that I'd make this work no matter what.

341
00:18:12,114 --> 00:18:15,384
I told her I was sending Mallet to the perfect home.

342
00:18:18,283 --> 00:18:19,513
I'll find out.

343
00:18:20,253 --> 00:18:23,354
I must find out if there's something wrong with the husband.

344

(CEO Raphael)

345
00:18:39,574 --> 00:18:41,404
Hello, sir.

346
00:18:41,604 --> 00:18:43,573
I was just wondering...

347
00:18:43,574 --> 00:18:46,673
if I'd be able to see you and your wife...

348
00:18:46,674 --> 00:18:50,114
I mean, I'd like to speak with you and Ms. Lee Ma Ri in person.

349
00:18:52,713 --> 00:18:54,183
Both of us?

350
00:18:54,184 --> 00:18:55,722
That's right.

351
00:18:55,723 --> 00:18:59,023
I'd like to discuss a few things regarding the baby.

352
00:18:59,193 --> 00:19:00,324
I see.

353
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:02,363
Well...

354
00:19:02,364 --> 00:19:05,164
But I'm not sure if Ms. Lee can join us. She's very busy.

355
00:19:05,463 --> 00:19:06,664
What?

356
00:19:07,064 --> 00:19:10,302
This is about the baby. She's too busy?

357
00:19:10,303 --> 00:19:12,334
Well, no. We should meet.

358
00:19:14,074 --> 00:19:15,232
But...

359
00:19:15,233 --> 00:19:16,803
can't you discuss it with me?

360
00:19:18,503 --> 00:19:20,772
Is there a reason I shouldn't meet with your wife?

361
00:19:20,773 --> 00:19:21,874
No.

362
00:19:22,614 --> 00:19:25,043
It's not... It's not that.

363
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,314
You can meet her, of course.

364
00:19:27,753 --> 00:19:31,023
Then I'll check her schedule and get back to you.

365
00:19:31,523 --> 00:19:32,594
- Wait. - Talk soon.

366
00:19:32,924 --> 00:19:34,053
Hello?

367
00:19:37,693 --> 00:19:39,164
He hung up? What the...

368
00:19:46,404 --> 00:19:47,433
He hung up on me?

369
00:19:47,434 --> 00:19:48,702
Is he out of his mind?

370
00:19:48,703 --> 00:19:50,904
I'm asking to meet up because of the baby, and he's too busy?

371
00:19:58,753 --> 00:20:01,053
I had to take this call. I'm sorry.

372
00:20:01,914 --> 00:20:03,184
It's okay.

373
00:20:04,523 --> 00:20:06,953
Since there are a lot of eyes watching,

374
00:20:07,693 --> 00:20:09,323
please understand having to meet like this.

375
00:20:09,324 --> 00:20:10,594
I understand.

376
00:20:10,664 --> 00:20:11,664
But still,

377
00:20:11,864 --> 00:20:15,394
I'm just happy that we can meet like this.

378
00:20:23,674 --> 00:20:24,674
Hey!

379
00:20:29,644 --> 00:20:31,083
Why did you come?

380
00:20:31,084 --> 00:20:33,114
Why is fate so cruel?

381
00:20:33,914 --> 00:20:35,353
Let me talk to my daughter.

382
00:20:35,354 --> 00:20:37,584
Let me tell her that I'm her father.

383
00:20:37,654 --> 00:20:39,522
This is so hard on me.

384
00:20:39,523 --> 00:20:41,124
It's difficult for Woo Ri as well.

385
00:20:41,394 --> 00:20:42,693
Stop making a fuss.

386
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:45,834
Did something happen to Woo Ri?

387
00:20:46,864 --> 00:20:49,604
I met her, but she didn't look so good.

388
00:20:49,733 --> 00:20:51,834
Meet her? Why?

389
00:20:51,934 --> 00:20:53,603
I told you to wait.

390
00:20:53,604 --> 00:20:55,803
Stop shouting at me.

391
00:20:56,344 --> 00:20:57,844
I work with her.

392
00:20:58,574 --> 00:21:00,313
I met her at the writer's office.

393
00:21:00,314 --> 00:21:02,113
You didn't tell her you're her father, did you?

394
00:21:02,114 --> 00:21:03,844
I didn't.

395
00:21:04,243 --> 00:21:08,314
But she's so beautiful.

396
00:21:08,483 --> 00:21:09,684
She is.

397
00:21:10,124 --> 00:21:13,593
She's the most beautiful, the kindest, and the smartest.

398
00:21:13,594 --> 00:21:15,053
Gosh.

399
00:21:17,094 --> 00:21:18,993
- Choi Seoung Il! - Choi Seoung Il?

400
00:21:21,094 --> 00:21:24,364
Mr. Choi Seoung Il?

401
00:21:24,904 --> 00:21:25,973
What?

402
00:21:26,404 --> 00:21:30,074
What brings you here?

403
00:21:30,144 --> 00:21:32,243
- Well... - Well...

404
00:21:32,814 --> 00:21:34,074

Oh Eun Ran!

407
00:21:39,513 --> 00:21:41,383
Do you know each other?

408
00:21:41,384 --> 00:21:43,722
Well...

409
00:21:43,723 --> 00:21:45,594
- You're back. - What?

410
00:21:46,793 --> 00:21:49,323
Did you like my pork cutlet? You crave it, don't you?

411
00:21:49,324 --> 00:21:50,962
Yes.

412
00:21:50,963 --> 00:21:53,233
Have you been here before?

413
00:21:53,334 --> 00:21:56,634
Well, that is...

414
00:21:57,064 --> 00:21:59,303
Actually,

Eun Ran and I...

416

Were classmates. From middle school, aren't we?

417

00:22:17,723 --> 00:22:20,893
What a relationship that is! Take a seat.

422
00:22:20,894 --> 00:22:23,523
You didn't eat, did you? Shall we have dinner together?

423
00:22:23,594 --> 00:22:25,123
- Dinner all together? - Yes!

424
00:22:25,124 --> 00:22:26,363
- Seriously? - Yes!

425
00:22:26,364 --> 00:22:28,063

- Yes. - Don't you need to go now?

428
00:22:32,703 --> 00:22:35,173
- You said you were busy. - Me? Busy?

429
00:22:35,174 --> 00:22:37,103
You wanted to meet next time since you are busy.

430
00:22:37,104 --> 00:22:38,603
- Right? - What about dinner?

431
00:22:38,604 --> 00:22:40,414
Next time.

432
00:22:40,814 --> 00:22:42,114
- Let's go. - Okay.

433
00:22:42,943 --> 00:22:44,084
Ms. Oh,

434
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:48,213

- No, come quick. - Wait, wait.

440
00:23:18,043 --> 00:23:20,814
- You need to stop this. - Eun Ran, we'll get hurt.

441
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:22,983
This is not the right time. No.

442
00:23:23,223 --> 00:23:25,423
- You should go and don't come back. - Wait, seriously...

443
00:23:25,424 --> 00:23:28,654
No! Just leave.

I couldn't sleep thinking about that all night.

Do you think I could raise it well?

455

She wouldn't want to send the baby to a murder suspect.

495
00:26:46,924 --> 00:26:48,753
So if something goes wrong on my side...

496
00:26:48,924 --> 00:26:52,763
you might end up raising the baby.

497
00:26:54,033 --> 00:26:56,263
That's not a nice thought, is it?

498
00:26:56,463 --> 00:26:57,533
Ms. Ma Ri,

499
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:00,173
I've been investigating for days.

500
00:27:00,174 --> 00:27:01,873
Your call history, messages, and your e-mails, everything.

501
00:27:01,874 --> 00:27:04,303
I even checked the black box videos.

502
00:27:04,703 --> 00:27:06,614
I didn't report it because there were no charges.

503
00:27:08,614 --> 00:27:10,844
I guess you and I must be on the same side.

504
00:27:12,283 --> 00:27:13,313
Excuse me?

505
00:27:13,314 --> 00:27:15,552
You want us to raise the baby.

506
00:27:15,553 --> 00:27:17,684
I'm so desperate as well.

507
00:27:18,584 --> 00:27:20,753
I think you need to help us a lot.

508
00:27:23,023 --> 00:27:26,134
Make sure you hide the things that my husband shouldn't find out.

509
00:27:41,473 --> 00:27:44,844
Mom, do you know what just happened?

510
00:27:45,213 --> 00:27:47,753
You wouldn't believe it. This is incredible.

511
00:27:48,053 --> 00:27:50,553
I think the universe is on our side.

512
00:27:51,184 --> 00:27:54,193
I met this police officer, and you won't know who he is...

513
00:27:56,124 --> 00:27:57,324
Wait, my necklace.

514
00:27:58,664 --> 00:28:00,394
Nothing, just hang up.

515
00:28:07,233 --> 00:28:09,404
Wait!

516
00:28:09,743 --> 00:28:10,773
Stop.

517
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:12,614
Detective Lee Kang Jae.

518
00:28:14,443 --> 00:28:16,043
I think you need to help me.

519
00:28:20,513 --> 00:28:23,353
Are you sure this is for us?

520
00:28:23,354 --> 00:28:26,824
- Yes. - I mean, then who sent it?

521
00:28:26,953 --> 00:28:28,992
Hello, everyone.

522
00:28:28,993 --> 00:28:31,594
It arrived. It looks so luxurious.

523
00:28:32,594 --> 00:28:36,262
I wanted you to work in a comfortable environment.

524
00:28:36,263 --> 00:28:38,503
So I sent all of this.

525
00:28:40,074 --> 00:28:42,233
Was it too much?

526
00:28:42,604 --> 00:28:46,013
But this is nothing for me if it's for the baby.

527
00:28:46,144 --> 00:28:47,644
I would do more if I could.

528
00:28:48,414 --> 00:28:51,384
Whatever you do, I'd like for you to run it by me before you do it.

529
00:28:51,614 --> 00:28:53,683
Right.

530
00:28:53,684 --> 00:28:57,154
I will talk to you first from now on. Okay.

531
00:28:57,424 --> 00:28:58,453
Well...

532
00:28:59,424 --> 00:29:00,693
Well...

533
00:29:02,424 --> 00:29:05,723
I actually had something...

534
00:29:06,064 --> 00:29:08,462
I wanted to tell you.

535
00:29:08,463 --> 00:29:10,463
What is it? Tell me.

536
00:29:11,564 --> 00:29:14,434
Are you close with Choi Mi Ae?

537
00:29:14,503 --> 00:29:17,773
No, we are just acquaintances.

538
00:29:18,703 --> 00:29:20,314
Just acquaintances...

539
00:29:22,043 --> 00:29:24,114
- Well... - Raphael?

540
00:29:24,983 --> 00:29:26,013
What?

541
00:29:26,614 --> 00:29:28,252
Hello, Da Bin.

542
00:29:28,253 --> 00:29:31,124
Gosh, you. It's me, Ye Rin.

543
00:29:31,483 --> 00:29:33,793
- Right, Ye Rin. - How have you been?

544
00:29:33,924 --> 00:29:35,753
It's been so long.

545
00:29:36,263 --> 00:29:38,923
I'm having a business meeting here. Let's talk later.

546
00:29:38,924 --> 00:29:41,133
All right.

547
00:29:41,134 --> 00:29:42,564
- Call me. - Yes.

548
00:29:52,074 --> 00:29:54,443
- Sir. - Yes?

549
00:29:55,374 --> 00:29:56,983
Do you know a lot of women?

550
00:29:57,384 --> 00:30:00,453
No, well, just a few friends...

551
00:30:01,614 --> 00:30:04,654
What were you asking earlier? What about Choi Mi Ae?

552
00:30:04,783 --> 00:30:05,854
Nothing.

553
00:30:07,624 --> 00:30:08,993
I'm sorry. Just a second.

554
00:30:17,003 --> 00:30:18,064
(Incoming Message)

555
00:30:30,713 --> 00:30:31,713
(Actress Mi Ae)

556
00:30:32,314 --> 00:30:33,482
(I don't want to reveal it yet.)

557
00:30:33,483 --> 00:30:35,614
(How long are you going to keep this a secret? Call me.)

558
00:30:42,523 --> 00:30:44,424
Ms. Oh, shall we go now?

559
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:47,864
What's going on? Are you okay?

560
00:30:49,733 --> 00:30:50,803
Yes.

561
00:30:50,963 --> 00:30:52,334
I just slipped.

562
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:53,773
What? Are you all right?

563
00:30:54,773 --> 00:30:55,803
Yes, I'm okay.

564
00:30:57,773 --> 00:30:59,003
I don't know why I slipped.

565
00:31:11,023 --> 00:31:12,252
Do you think that makes sense?

566
00:31:12,253 --> 00:31:14,292
Am I your errand boy or something?

567
00:31:14,293 --> 00:31:17,424
What can I do? The necklace has my initials on it.

568
00:31:17,664 --> 00:31:19,293
Do you want me to be interviewed?

569
00:31:19,693 --> 00:31:21,693
Why don't you help me out a bit?

570
00:31:34,074 --> 00:31:35,574
Good job everyone.

571
00:31:37,344 --> 00:31:39,114
Who's this?

572
00:31:39,243 --> 00:31:40,384
Why are you here?

573
00:31:40,983 --> 00:31:43,424
I just wanted to take a look again.

574
00:31:44,084 --> 00:31:45,752
- What brings you here? - I came to see...

575
00:31:45,753 --> 00:31:47,424
if I missed anything.

576
00:31:48,424 --> 00:31:50,823
- Did you find anything? - No, I didn't.

577
00:31:50,824 --> 00:31:52,064
I couldn't find anything.

578
00:32:27,364 --> 00:32:28,664
You see, I have my own situation.

579
00:32:28,763 --> 00:32:31,134
So I don't want to let anyone know yet.

580
00:32:33,533 --> 00:32:35,033
Why is this embarrassing?

581
00:32:36,203 --> 00:32:37,674
Weren't you sincere about it?

582
00:32:37,844 --> 00:32:40,844
Is this something that we're not proud of?

583
00:32:41,973 --> 00:32:43,614
Please, understand.

584
00:32:54,824 --> 00:32:56,564
Ms. Oh, what are you doing here?

585
00:33:01,263 --> 00:33:02,493
Hello.

586
00:33:03,233 --> 00:33:05,634
I'm here to have a drink.

587
00:33:05,963 --> 00:33:07,104
Alone?

588
00:33:07,174 --> 00:33:09,174
Yes, by myself, of course.

589
00:33:17,243 --> 00:33:18,414
Sir.

590
00:33:18,614 --> 00:33:21,253
What's going on between you and Ms. Choi Mi Ae?

591
00:33:21,713 --> 00:33:23,953
What do you mean?

592
00:33:24,124 --> 00:33:25,583
You shouldn't be this way.

593
00:33:25,584 --> 00:33:27,492
Excuse me? What do you mean?

594
00:33:27,493 --> 00:33:29,763
I think I have a right to tell you this.

595
00:33:30,223 --> 00:33:32,763
If you continue to act like this, I'm going to reconsider.

596
00:33:32,894 --> 00:33:34,594
How can I trust you to have a baby...

597
00:33:36,803 --> 00:33:37,864
Gosh.

598
00:33:39,064 --> 00:33:40,634
Oh gosh.

599
00:33:41,604 --> 00:33:43,802
I think there's a misunderstanding.

600
00:33:43,803 --> 00:33:45,742
We're not like that...

601
00:33:45,743 --> 00:33:47,144
- this is... - Auntie!

602
00:33:48,614 --> 00:33:49,943
Soo Hyun, you're here.

603
00:33:50,814 --> 00:33:54,253
Say, hello. This is Raphael.

604
00:33:55,414 --> 00:33:56,753
Hello, nice to meet you.

605
00:33:57,184 --> 00:33:58,354
Soo Hyun, say hello.

606
00:33:59,753 --> 00:34:01,124
You must be shy.

607
00:34:01,293 --> 00:34:03,424
You even brought a gift for him.

608
00:34:03,523 --> 00:34:04,594
Go ahead, give it to him.

609
00:34:07,164 --> 00:34:09,233
Here, thank you.

610
00:34:11,134 --> 00:34:13,703
She wanted to give you her favourite stuffed animal.

611
00:34:14,673 --> 00:34:16,274
Thank you so much.

612
00:34:16,504 --> 00:34:18,643
Thanks to you, we met some good doctors.

613
00:34:18,644 --> 00:34:20,743
And we were able to get through.

614
00:34:21,374 --> 00:34:24,044
Is it okay for me to have this?

615
00:34:24,184 --> 00:34:25,283
Yes.

616
00:34:30,383 --> 00:34:31,683
(Mr. Raphael, I will get better.)

617
00:34:31,684 --> 00:34:33,453
(Thank you for introducing a good doctor for me.)

618
00:34:34,323 --> 00:34:35,453
But,

619
00:34:35,894 --> 00:34:37,694
I didn't do much.

620
00:34:37,923 --> 00:34:42,133
Honestly, I said that this meeting even was too much.

621
00:34:42,263 --> 00:34:44,303
This is all for Soo Hyun.

622
00:34:49,874 --> 00:34:51,044
Soo Hyun,

623
00:34:51,274 --> 00:34:52,473
thank you for the gift.

624
00:34:53,573 --> 00:34:57,144
I also suffered from the same disease as you before.

625
00:34:57,283 --> 00:34:59,144
And I'm all better now.

626
00:34:59,243 --> 00:35:00,914
See? I'm all healthy.

627
00:35:01,354 --> 00:35:03,783
You will get better too.

628
00:35:04,053 --> 00:35:07,093
So, listen to what your doctor tells you...

629
00:35:07,354 --> 00:35:10,164
and get your treatment bravely, all right?

630
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:11,564
Yes, I will.

631
00:35:17,863 --> 00:35:19,163
Well...

632
00:35:19,164 --> 00:35:20,632
I have something urgent to attend to,

633
00:35:20,633 --> 00:35:21,873
so I'll get going.

634
00:35:21,874 --> 00:35:23,444
Goodbye.

635
00:35:25,444 --> 00:35:26,644
Go, Soo Hyun!

636
00:35:27,944 --> 00:35:29,444
Wait, Ms. Oh.

637
00:35:29,883 --> 00:35:30,944
Let's go together.

638
00:35:31,243 --> 00:35:33,214
What's wrong. It's fine.

639
00:35:47,394 --> 00:35:50,333
Sir, I think I'll get off now.

640
00:35:50,334 --> 00:35:51,633
Wait.

641
00:35:52,263 --> 00:35:54,402
Here? You can't.

642
00:35:54,403 --> 00:35:56,743
How can you go from here? Let's talk a little.

643
00:35:56,843 --> 00:35:58,243
The weather's nice today.

644
00:35:59,814 --> 00:36:00,914
Right.

645
00:36:10,984 --> 00:36:13,723
I've looked you up online for two days.

646
00:36:15,254 --> 00:36:16,323
You did?

647
00:36:16,923 --> 00:36:18,293
There are a lot of things about me, aren't there?

648
00:36:18,294 --> 00:36:19,294
Yes.

649
00:36:19,934 --> 00:36:21,733
There were a lot of articles,

650
00:36:21,734 --> 00:36:24,604
photos, and rumours...

651
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:27,633
Yes, I partied a lot.

652
00:36:28,303 --> 00:36:29,873
Nobody hates having fun, do they?

653
00:36:29,874 --> 00:36:31,743
Right, it seems that way.

654
00:36:32,673 --> 00:36:34,573
But a lot of it is exaggerated.

655
00:36:34,743 --> 00:36:36,613
I wasn't that bad.

656
00:36:40,513 --> 00:36:41,653
Do you want to see this?

657
00:36:47,153 --> 00:36:49,093
This is my mother. Isn't she pretty?

658
00:36:52,423 --> 00:36:54,934
But she passed away early when I was in middle school.

659
00:36:56,363 --> 00:37:00,434
I think I started to act out ever since she died.

660
00:37:00,734 --> 00:37:04,044
You know those kids who do things they're told not to.

661
00:37:07,173 --> 00:37:09,214
I was like that even after I became an adult.

662
00:37:09,444 --> 00:37:11,944
And then one day, they told me I had stomach cancer.

663
00:37:15,214 --> 00:37:16,652
The funny thing is...

664
00:37:16,653 --> 00:37:18,753
that my mother died from stomach cancer as well.

665
00:37:18,754 --> 00:37:19,993
And I had the same disease.

666
00:37:21,593 --> 00:37:22,794
When the doctor told me...

667
00:37:23,323 --> 00:37:25,863
I had stage three stomach cancer,

668
00:37:26,363 --> 00:37:28,564
it felt like my mother...

669
00:37:29,164 --> 00:37:31,633
was telling me that I shouldn't live like that...

670
00:37:33,104 --> 00:37:34,473
from above.

671
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:38,644
I think my mom is so great,

672
00:37:39,303 --> 00:37:44,113
telling me such a thing so that her son would live properly.

673
00:37:45,144 --> 00:37:46,684
Isn't she such a great mom?

674
00:37:53,294 --> 00:37:54,493
Ms. Oh,

675
00:37:55,653 --> 00:37:58,693
I understand that you don't want to send the baby...

676
00:37:58,694 --> 00:37:59,723
to a weird person.

677
00:38:00,533 --> 00:38:01,763
But...

678
00:38:02,993 --> 00:38:04,464
I'm not that kind of person.

679
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:06,604
I may have been once,

680
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:08,374
but I'm not that person anymore.

681
00:38:11,173 --> 00:38:12,803
I'm sorry I questioned you.

682
00:38:14,843 --> 00:38:18,843
Wasn't that a reasonable suspicion to have?

683
00:38:19,513 --> 00:38:21,282
I was so worried...

684
00:38:21,283 --> 00:38:23,323
that Mallet would have an unhappy life.

685
00:38:23,953 --> 00:38:25,153
Who? Mallet?

686
00:38:25,653 --> 00:38:26,754
Pardon?

687
00:38:28,254 --> 00:38:31,294
- I decided to call the baby that. - Right.

688
00:38:32,164 --> 00:38:35,794
I was out of my mind because I was so worried.

689
00:38:36,533 --> 00:38:38,903
I followed you.

690
00:38:41,633 --> 00:38:42,834
Sir,

691
00:38:43,243 --> 00:38:45,643
you don't have any problems...

692
00:38:45,644 --> 00:38:48,243
between you and Ms. Ma Ri, right?

693
00:38:51,084 --> 00:38:54,153
There's nothing going on between us.

694
00:39:10,363 --> 00:39:12,403
Please sit. Continue with your work.

695
00:39:15,303 --> 00:39:16,504
Where's Ms. Lee?

696
00:39:16,703 --> 00:39:18,903
She went out for work.

697
00:39:18,973 --> 00:39:20,414
Should I call her?

698
00:39:21,214 --> 00:39:22,874
- No, I'll do it. - Yes, sir.

699
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:45,604
Did you find my necklace?

700
00:39:46,673 --> 00:39:47,903
I threw it on the tray.

701
00:39:49,874 --> 00:39:50,902
Is this it?

702
00:39:50,903 --> 00:39:52,444
This is it. Thank you so much.

703
00:39:53,914 --> 00:39:55,144
What's wrong?

704
00:39:55,673 --> 00:39:57,343
I'm going to keep it while the investigation is going on.

705
00:39:59,084 --> 00:40:00,714
Aren't we on the same side?

706
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:04,953
I'm still thinking...

707
00:40:05,723 --> 00:40:06,894
whether or not I should join you.

708
00:40:25,874 --> 00:40:27,113
Honey.

709
00:40:29,444 --> 00:40:30,484
Tomorrow?

710
00:40:31,343 --> 00:40:34,754
Oh, really? No, we must go.

711
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:38,453
Tomorrow, 2pm, at the hospital?

712
00:40:39,524 --> 00:40:40,593
Okay.

713
00:40:41,624 --> 00:40:43,093
Thank you.

714
00:40:46,863 --> 00:40:47,934
Perfect.

715
00:40:51,033 --> 00:40:52,303
You're going to the hospital tomorrow?

716
00:40:52,363 --> 00:40:53,374
Yes.

717
00:40:54,504 --> 00:40:55,673
You too?

718
00:40:58,504 --> 00:40:59,604
Darn it.

719
00:41:04,644 --> 00:41:06,513
Woo Ri!

720
00:41:06,814 --> 00:41:09,083
Thank you so much.

721
00:41:09,084 --> 00:41:11,583
I don't know how to thank you.

722
00:41:11,584 --> 00:41:12,853
Not at all.

723
00:41:12,854 --> 00:41:14,592
Are you here alone?

724
00:41:14,593 --> 00:41:16,793
Since it's your first ultrasound,

725
00:41:16,794 --> 00:41:20,093
my husband and father-in-law are all here.

726
00:41:20,194 --> 00:41:21,233
Are you alone?

727
00:41:21,234 --> 00:41:23,703
No, they're parking the car.

728
00:41:24,033 --> 00:41:26,874
Hello. How are you?

729
00:41:28,033 --> 00:41:30,173
Thank you so much. You're doing the right thing.

730
00:41:30,343 --> 00:41:31,972
Get your hands off her.

731
00:41:31,973 --> 00:41:34,274
It's good to see you like this.

732
00:41:34,343 --> 00:41:36,513
We might grow on each other if we keep this up.

733
00:41:37,714 --> 00:41:39,513
We won't be meeting again.

734
00:41:40,254 --> 00:41:42,953
You must be glad to have an heir to carry on the family tradition.

735
00:41:43,113 --> 00:41:44,623
You just have to die now.

736
00:41:44,624 --> 00:41:46,683
- What's wrong with her? - Let me introduce myself.

737
00:41:46,684 --> 00:41:49,354
I'm Raphael, CEO of Diamond Cosmetics.

738
00:41:51,524 --> 00:41:53,294
I'm the owner of the sperm.

739
00:41:53,863 --> 00:41:55,894
He means he's the father.

740
00:41:56,394 --> 00:41:58,563
Okay. And I'm Woo Ri's mom.

741
00:41:58,564 --> 00:42:00,933
Thank you for making the tough decision.

742
00:42:00,934 --> 00:42:03,573
Call me if there's anything you need from me.

743
00:42:03,944 --> 00:42:06,444
I think it best we meet as little as possible.

744
00:42:06,914 --> 00:42:09,843
- Let's register. - Okay. Sit somewhere and wait.

745
00:42:11,944 --> 00:42:14,314
Woo Ri, ladies.

746
00:42:15,354 --> 00:42:18,153
What shall we name the baby when it's born?

747
00:42:18,283 --> 00:42:20,722
Will it be a boy or a girl?

748
00:42:20,723 --> 00:42:23,223
I hope it's a girl that looks like me.

749
00:42:23,723 --> 00:42:25,464
How could it look like you?

750
00:42:26,064 --> 00:42:27,964
It could look like me.

751
00:42:28,164 --> 00:42:31,664
Wouldn't a boy that resembles Raphael be so cute too?

752
00:42:32,064 --> 00:42:33,064
Oh Woo Ri?

753
00:42:33,065 --> 00:42:34,433
- Yes? - Yes!

754
00:42:34,434 --> 00:42:35,573
It's her right here.

755
00:42:37,504 --> 00:42:38,802
Hello, doctor.

756
00:42:38,803 --> 00:42:40,612
I'm the grandmother.

757
00:42:40,613 --> 00:42:44,084
Oh, the grandmother of the baby she's carrying?

758
00:42:44,243 --> 00:42:46,143
In that case, I'm the great-grandmother.

759
00:42:46,144 --> 00:42:48,783
I called the hospital director.

760
00:42:48,854 --> 00:42:50,052
Isn't there a bigger room?

761
00:42:50,053 --> 00:42:52,283
This is the largest ultrasound room.

762
00:42:52,484 --> 00:42:55,853
There are too many people. A few of you must leave.

763
00:42:55,854 --> 00:42:57,164
You wait outside.

764
00:42:57,363 --> 00:42:58,422
You should.

765
00:42:58,423 --> 00:43:00,263
Can you not point your finger?

766
00:43:00,294 --> 00:43:01,893
- Hey. - Detective Lee.

767
00:43:01,894 --> 00:43:03,762
Did you not say hello to my father-in-law?

768
00:43:03,763 --> 00:43:04,934
You're an officer?

769
00:43:05,064 --> 00:43:07,702
Say your hellos outside. I can't do anything like this.

770
00:43:07,703 --> 00:43:08,903
Who will leave?

771
00:43:09,073 --> 00:43:10,572
I... I can't leave.

772
00:43:10,573 --> 00:43:12,402
- I'm her fiancé. - I'm the grandfather.

773
00:43:12,403 --> 00:43:14,112
- I'm the mom. - We're her family.

774
00:43:14,113 --> 00:43:16,373
- We can't leave. - We must be here.

775
00:43:16,374 --> 00:43:18,013
Quiet!

776
00:43:20,153 --> 00:43:22,414
- Oh Woo Ri! - Yes? That's me.

777
00:43:23,354 --> 00:43:26,124
- Who's the baby's father? - I am.

778
00:43:27,254 --> 00:43:30,493
Other than these two, the rest of you can leave.

779
00:43:30,723 --> 00:43:31,794
Okay?

780
00:43:32,363 --> 00:43:34,163
- No. - Call the director!

781
00:43:34,164 --> 00:43:36,862
- I called him! - You don't have to worry.

782
00:43:36,863 --> 00:43:38,532
- This is my heir! - We're family!

783
00:43:38,533 --> 00:43:40,434
Republic of Korea!

784
00:43:42,774 --> 00:43:45,144
I can't do anything if you won't cooperate!

785
00:43:45,703 --> 00:43:47,373
- Let's go, then. - Okay.

786
00:43:47,374 --> 00:43:50,113
- We must leave? - You started all this.

787
00:43:52,343 --> 00:43:54,553
Let's begin. The gel is cold.

788
00:43:54,754 --> 00:43:55,814
Okay.

789
00:43:57,383 --> 00:43:59,084
Are you okay, Ms. Oh?

790
00:43:59,223 --> 00:44:00,493
Yes.

791
00:44:02,854 --> 00:44:04,823
You can call me by my name.

792
00:44:05,294 --> 00:44:07,163
Don't call me Ms. Oh.

793
00:44:07,164 --> 00:44:08,794
I'm just an assistant writer.

794
00:44:08,934 --> 00:44:11,703
No. You write stuff and that makes you a writer.

795
00:44:11,834 --> 00:44:15,533
Since when did you want to be a writer?

796
00:44:18,004 --> 00:44:19,973
Since I was in middle school.

797
00:44:21,644 --> 00:44:23,584
I wanted to be a writer,

798
00:44:23,783 --> 00:44:26,214
so I studied literature in university.

799
00:44:26,544 --> 00:44:29,984
The more I learned, the more daunting my dream became.

800
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:33,653
I considered trying to become a teacher,

801
00:44:35,024 --> 00:44:37,194
but on my pre-graduation trip...

802
00:44:37,964 --> 00:44:39,593
I dream of...

803
00:44:40,664 --> 00:44:42,993
becoming a drama scriptwriter.

804
00:44:44,604 --> 00:44:46,903
But I feel too overwhelmed to start.

805
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:53,444
It's the first time I voiced what I always thought.

806
00:44:54,073 --> 00:44:56,073
I was too timid to even talk about it.

807
00:44:56,414 --> 00:44:59,283
Why do you need the courage to say something you want?

808
00:44:59,984 --> 00:45:02,414
How can you achieve your dream if you can't say what it is?

809
00:45:04,323 --> 00:45:05,524
Say it to me.

810
00:45:06,624 --> 00:45:09,124
My dream is to become a drama screenwriter.

811
00:45:10,923 --> 00:45:12,623
My dream is to become a drama screenwriter.

812
00:45:12,624 --> 00:45:15,564
That's it. You should say it aloud so it comes true.

813
00:45:17,533 --> 00:45:20,934
My dream is to become a drama screenwriter.

814
00:45:25,803 --> 00:45:27,943
My dream is to become a drama screenwriter!

815
00:45:27,944 --> 00:45:29,944
That's it!

816
00:45:30,613 --> 00:45:32,214
- Ms. Writer. - Yes?

817
00:45:33,513 --> 00:45:35,453
- Ms. Oh the writer! - Yes?

818
00:45:36,314 --> 00:45:38,853
Writer Oh Woo Ri!

819
00:45:38,854 --> 00:45:39,953
Yes?

820
00:45:58,544 --> 00:46:01,914
There was something I'd never done in my life.

821
00:46:02,644 --> 00:46:06,343
I found the courage to do it on my pre-graduation trip.

822
00:46:08,254 --> 00:46:11,854
That's when I started to try to work as a writer.

823
00:46:12,453 --> 00:46:13,624
I see.

824
00:46:17,694 --> 00:46:20,093
To the person who gave me the courage,

825
00:46:20,964 --> 00:46:23,133
I'm thankful, even now.

826
00:46:25,434 --> 00:46:26,763
Look at the monitor.

827
00:46:28,173 --> 00:46:30,843
It's too soon to hear a heartbeat.

828
00:46:31,303 --> 00:46:34,144
What you see here is the baby.

829
00:46:34,774 --> 00:46:36,874
It's the size of a gummy bear.

830
00:46:39,914 --> 00:46:42,984
It's so tiny.

831
00:46:44,383 --> 00:46:47,553
Hello, gummy bear.

832
00:46:52,823 --> 00:46:55,163
How many times must I tell you?

833
00:46:55,164 --> 00:46:56,633
It's fine.

834
00:46:58,564 --> 00:46:59,604
Okay.

835
00:46:59,934 --> 00:47:02,633
Doesn't it feel weird knowing they're in there alone?

836
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:05,073
I feel strange too.

837
00:47:07,774 --> 00:47:09,243
I did a lot of thinking,

838
00:47:10,044 --> 00:47:11,243
and I changed my mind.

839
00:47:13,144 --> 00:47:14,314
I'll report it.

840
00:47:15,414 --> 00:47:16,453
What?

841
00:47:19,423 --> 00:47:20,754
Are you crazy?

842
00:47:21,593 --> 00:47:23,024
You'll raise someone else's baby?

843
00:47:24,294 --> 00:47:25,294
Ma Ri!

844
00:47:25,823 --> 00:47:27,294
Yes, Father?

845
00:47:28,164 --> 00:47:30,262
Chairman Lee's wife called.

846
00:47:30,263 --> 00:47:31,532
Is there more to be done?

847
00:47:31,533 --> 00:47:34,934
I got her another nose job done last week.

848
00:47:35,104 --> 00:47:38,944
The baby seems to be so healthy and cute.

849
00:47:39,073 --> 00:47:41,543
The mother's healthy too.

850
00:47:41,544 --> 00:47:43,512
Isn't that just great?

851
00:47:43,513 --> 00:47:44,842
Watch your footing on the steps.

852
00:47:44,843 --> 00:47:46,544
There are steps. Be careful.

853
00:47:47,914 --> 00:47:49,484
That's it. Take your time.

854
00:47:49,883 --> 00:47:52,153
We're almost there.

855
00:47:54,093 --> 00:47:55,423
She's my fiancée.

856
00:47:55,794 --> 00:47:56,993
She has my baby.

857
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:02,633
What are you two doing?

858
00:48:03,334 --> 00:48:05,104
They're just steps. I can manage.

859
00:48:10,203 --> 00:48:11,303
(Detective: Lee Kang Jae)

860
00:48:12,544 --> 00:48:15,472
Oh, dear. What's this now?

861
00:48:15,473 --> 00:48:18,613
I went against your order and looked into No Man Chul.

862
00:48:19,414 --> 00:48:21,484
No Man Chul's mistress...

863
00:48:21,814 --> 00:48:23,513
is a team leader at a medical foundation,

864
00:48:24,484 --> 00:48:26,152
and the wife of a cosmetics company CEO.

865
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:27,194
What?

866
00:48:29,493 --> 00:48:30,693
(Photo Evidence)

867
00:48:30,694 --> 00:48:32,064
Why are you bringing me this now?

868
00:48:32,323 --> 00:48:35,992
I apologize. I didn't report it.

869
00:48:35,993 --> 00:48:37,234
Are you out of your mind?

870
00:48:39,664 --> 00:48:41,234
Lee Ma Ri's clean.

871
00:48:41,374 --> 00:48:43,234
But a detective has a hunch.

872
00:48:44,073 --> 00:48:46,504
It was clearly Chairman Kim, but it looks like an affair...

873
00:48:50,613 --> 00:48:53,484
I apologize. I made the wrong call.

874
00:48:53,584 --> 00:48:55,383
I want a written account from you.

875
00:48:56,283 --> 00:48:59,024
The rest to the meeting room. We'll start over.

876
00:49:03,223 --> 00:49:04,263
What is it?

877
00:49:06,024 --> 00:49:07,064
Here.

878
00:49:09,334 --> 00:49:10,703
Divorce papers?

879
00:49:12,403 --> 00:49:14,274
Why did you call me to the hospital?

880
00:49:14,504 --> 00:49:16,133
Hadn't you changed your mind?

881
00:49:17,444 --> 00:49:20,143
Didn't you hear Oh Woo Ri say we can't have the baby if we split?

882
00:49:20,144 --> 00:49:21,214
Look inside.

883
00:49:28,684 --> 00:49:31,584
It's the size of a gummy bear.

884
00:49:33,484 --> 00:49:35,354
Seeing it made me think.

885
00:49:35,923 --> 00:49:39,524
I still can't forgive you for what you did.

886
00:49:39,863 --> 00:49:42,064
But for the baby's sake...

887
00:49:43,633 --> 00:49:47,403
Thank you! Thank you, darling!

888
00:49:53,004 --> 00:49:55,573
How does it feel to be a mom?

889
00:49:56,973 --> 00:49:58,214
A mom?

890
00:49:59,743 --> 00:50:00,984
Why?

891
00:50:02,184 --> 00:50:05,553
What is it? Are you that emotional?

892
00:50:06,254 --> 00:50:09,223
There will be many more things to be emotional about.

893
00:50:09,923 --> 00:50:11,323
What should I do?

894
00:50:12,423 --> 00:50:13,464
About what?

895
00:50:15,164 --> 00:50:16,964
It wasn't a mallet.

896
00:50:18,263 --> 00:50:19,434
What do you mean?

897
00:50:21,374 --> 00:50:23,504
It's a baby, not a mallet.

898
00:50:26,073 --> 00:50:28,714
It's not an object I can give away.

899
00:50:29,214 --> 00:50:32,084
I feel stupid for thinking that way.

900
00:50:34,453 --> 00:50:35,754
To be honest,

901
00:50:36,053 --> 00:50:38,354
I wasn't in my right mind for the past few days.

902
00:50:39,323 --> 00:50:43,024
To see if it was right to send it to a good home,

903
00:50:43,323 --> 00:50:45,493
I did all sorts of things.

904
00:50:47,434 --> 00:50:50,863
I feel this way because of something the size of a fingernail.

905
00:50:52,664 --> 00:50:54,902
I can't imagine how I'll feel...

906
00:50:54,903 --> 00:50:57,504
after I give birth after nine months.

907
00:51:01,214 --> 00:51:02,814
You're right.

908
00:51:03,444 --> 00:51:04,613
You were right...

909
00:51:05,814 --> 00:51:10,624
about how I'd feel about giving the baby away.

910
00:51:11,423 --> 00:51:12,584
I really...

911
00:51:13,754 --> 00:51:16,024
didn't think it would be this hard.

912
00:51:20,394 --> 00:51:21,734
The truth is,

913
00:51:23,234 --> 00:51:25,164
and I haven't told anyone,

914
00:51:27,303 --> 00:51:30,434
but when I look at this photo, I get so scared.

915
00:51:34,843 --> 00:51:35,973
It's okay.

916
00:51:36,144 --> 00:51:38,444
It'll be okay, Woo Ri.

917
00:51:40,013 --> 00:51:41,814
You made this choice,

918
00:51:42,684 --> 00:51:44,624
and whatever other choices you make,

919
00:51:45,423 --> 00:51:47,923
I will support you now.

920
00:51:49,624 --> 00:51:51,723
That's what your grandma did for me.

921
00:51:52,964 --> 00:51:54,164
Yes.

922
00:51:54,564 --> 00:51:55,934
I'll do it for you too.

923
00:51:57,294 --> 00:52:00,164
I really don't know, Mom.

924
00:52:02,504 --> 00:52:07,044
It doesn't mean I found the courage to raise it.

925
00:52:07,914 --> 00:52:09,874
I'm just so scared.

926
00:52:10,343 --> 00:52:12,914
I just don't know anything.

927
00:52:15,383 --> 00:52:17,013
It's okay, Woo Ri.

928
00:52:18,423 --> 00:52:20,153
I don't know anything either.

929
00:52:20,754 --> 00:52:22,992
When Eun Ran had you,

930
00:52:22,993 --> 00:52:24,964
and now that you have this baby,

931
00:52:25,263 --> 00:52:28,164
I didn't know then, and I still don't know what to do.

932
00:52:28,633 --> 00:52:29,964
Let's just...

933
00:52:30,133 --> 00:52:33,164
solve one piece of homework that we're given at a time.

934
00:52:33,664 --> 00:52:36,633
No one knows if our answer is right or wrong.

935
00:52:37,444 --> 00:52:41,073
Let's just do our best to solve it.

936
00:52:54,823 --> 00:52:57,194
You can't cover the sky with one hand.

937
00:52:59,394 --> 00:53:00,423
As a father,

938
00:53:01,464 --> 00:53:03,164
you must protect your family.

939
00:53:04,664 --> 00:53:05,803
The truth no longer...

940
00:53:10,803 --> 00:53:11,944
No longer what?

941
00:53:12,774 --> 00:53:13,902
What is it now?

942
00:53:13,903 --> 00:53:15,673
What's the matter with him these days?

943
00:53:16,513 --> 00:53:18,084
Why is he talking nonsense?

944
00:53:19,684 --> 00:53:20,783
The truth...

945
00:53:21,584 --> 00:53:23,053
Cut!

946
00:53:24,823 --> 00:53:26,353
Are you all right?

947
00:53:26,354 --> 00:53:27,953
You must do another take.

948
00:53:28,223 --> 00:53:31,493
Use the clip we just took and wrap up for the day.

949
00:53:31,823 --> 00:53:33,564
I must be somewhere.

950
00:53:33,723 --> 00:53:36,033
We have to shoot today's quota.

951
00:53:36,633 --> 00:53:38,703
You're doing great. I'll buy you wine.

952
00:53:39,803 --> 00:53:41,633
Seoung Il!

953
00:53:43,274 --> 00:53:45,004
Will someone go after him?

954
00:53:47,004 --> 00:53:49,173
You can't cover the sky with one hand.

955
00:53:49,814 --> 00:53:51,513
I must tell my daughter that.

956
00:53:51,584 --> 00:53:52,882
You can't.

957
00:53:52,883 --> 00:53:54,853
She's too worked up.

958
00:53:54,854 --> 00:53:56,012
She's struggling.

959
00:53:56,013 --> 00:53:57,722
Why is she struggling?

960
00:53:57,723 --> 00:53:59,152
Tell me that at least.

961
00:53:59,153 --> 00:54:01,694
I might end up dying first.

962
00:54:02,493 --> 00:54:03,722
Woo Ri.

963
00:54:03,723 --> 00:54:05,093
I'm your father.

964
00:54:05,464 --> 00:54:06,894
I must tell her now.

965
00:54:07,024 --> 00:54:08,362
Eun Ran.

966
00:54:08,363 --> 00:54:10,633
It's not recycling day today.

967
00:54:10,834 --> 00:54:13,234
- Why is this out here? - Hide.

968
00:54:13,303 --> 00:54:14,774
Hide, quick.

969
00:54:15,234 --> 00:54:16,572
There's something more valuable.

970
00:54:16,573 --> 00:54:17,673
Eun Ran?

971
00:54:18,673 --> 00:54:22,274
- More valuable than revenge. - Wasn't she just here?

972
00:54:22,814 --> 00:54:24,782
Oh? "Mask of Desire" is on.

973
00:54:24,783 --> 00:54:26,144
I missed yesterday's episode.

974
00:54:28,513 --> 00:54:29,713
Duk Chil.

975
00:54:29,714 --> 00:54:31,422
You're overly excited.

976
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:32,524
Here.

977
00:54:32,953 --> 00:54:34,493
Look into my eyes.

978
00:54:34,723 --> 00:54:35,993
Take a deep breath in.

979
00:54:36,124 --> 00:54:38,222
Breathe in, breathe out.

980
00:54:38,223 --> 00:54:39,762
Breathe in, breathe out.

981
00:54:39,763 --> 00:54:41,033
That's it.

982
00:54:41,533 --> 00:54:42,664
Good.

983
00:54:43,263 --> 00:54:44,863
Why are you so pretty today?

984
00:54:45,564 --> 00:54:46,763
What?

985
00:54:46,903 --> 00:54:47,973
You...

986
00:54:48,104 --> 00:54:49,504
How old are you now?

987
00:54:51,144 --> 00:54:52,743
We're the same age.

988
00:54:52,903 --> 00:54:54,073
Oh, right.

989
00:54:55,874 --> 00:54:57,073
But you're still...

990
00:54:59,684 --> 00:55:00,883
the young Eun Ran...

991
00:55:01,453 --> 00:55:03,084
I knew.

992
00:55:04,923 --> 00:55:06,084
Duk Chil.

993
00:55:07,553 --> 00:55:08,823
How come...

994
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:11,124
you look the same?

995
00:55:12,564 --> 00:55:14,124
It's unbelievable.

996
00:55:15,694 --> 00:55:17,533
Oh, no. What are they doing?

997
00:55:17,664 --> 00:55:20,104
Shouldn't they not be doing that?

998
00:55:23,673 --> 00:55:24,874
Eun Ran!

999
00:55:24,973 --> 00:55:27,774
Eun Ran! Choi Seoung Il's kissing!

1000
00:55:45,593 --> 00:55:47,363
The CEO and his wife asked to meet?

1001
00:55:48,033 --> 00:55:49,164
Yes.

1002
00:55:49,593 --> 00:55:51,703
It was always chaotic when we met.

1003
00:55:52,004 --> 00:55:54,133
We'll have to stay in touch,

1004
00:55:54,573 --> 00:55:57,944
and I think it would be nice to meet them formally.

1005
00:55:58,144 --> 00:55:59,843
The CEO.

1006
00:56:00,144 --> 00:56:01,714
His real name is Kim Bok Rae.

1007
00:56:02,414 --> 00:56:04,843
- Did you know that? - What? No, I didn't.

1008
00:56:09,653 --> 00:56:10,883
No, I knew.

1009
00:56:11,823 --> 00:56:13,723
We agreed not to lie.

1010
00:56:14,593 --> 00:56:15,794
What?

1011
00:56:16,694 --> 00:56:19,464
There's something I didn't tell you.

1012
00:56:20,164 --> 00:56:21,363
What is it?

1013
00:56:21,464 --> 00:56:22,664
Well...

1014
00:56:22,763 --> 00:56:24,964
Remember when I told you about...

1015
00:56:25,564 --> 00:56:28,733
the guy I shared my first kiss with by the East Sea...

1016
00:56:28,734 --> 00:56:31,243
on my pre-graduation trip?

1017
00:56:41,613 --> 00:56:43,984
Is that guy this Kim Bok Rae?

1018
00:56:44,854 --> 00:56:46,883
Yes, it's him.

1019
00:56:47,993 --> 00:56:50,124
I was really shocked to find out.

1020
00:56:51,294 --> 00:56:52,493
My gosh.

1021
00:56:53,394 --> 00:56:56,493
No wonder I felt uneasy whenever he was around.

1022
00:56:56,633 --> 00:56:58,262
Sorry for not telling you.

1023
00:56:58,263 --> 00:56:59,603
No, don't be.

1024
00:56:59,604 --> 00:57:01,133
Why should you apologize?

1025
00:57:02,303 --> 00:57:03,473
What...

1026
00:57:03,973 --> 00:57:05,104
did he say?

1027
00:57:05,203 --> 00:57:06,544
He doesn't recognize me.

1028
00:57:06,803 --> 00:57:08,472
That was a few years back,

1029
00:57:08,473 --> 00:57:09,914
and it was a fleeting thing.

1030
00:57:10,613 --> 00:57:11,944
It happens.

1031
00:57:13,883 --> 00:57:15,113
Kang Jae.

1032
00:57:15,584 --> 00:57:17,153
You're not angry, are you?

1033
00:57:17,383 --> 00:57:18,754
Why would I be?

1034
00:57:19,124 --> 00:57:20,524
Not at all.

1035
00:57:21,524 --> 00:57:22,754
I feel fine.

1036
00:57:23,823 --> 00:57:25,723
Yes. I feel fine.

1037
00:57:26,464 --> 00:57:27,664
I feel fine.

1038
00:57:29,694 --> 00:57:31,664
Woo Ri and that detective.

1039
00:57:32,564 --> 00:57:35,104
Her fiancé. Are we meeting just those two?

1040
00:57:35,234 --> 00:57:37,774
Yes. I thought we should meet properly.

1041
00:57:39,044 --> 00:57:40,573
I'm not sure about the detective,

1042
00:57:41,444 --> 00:57:43,274
but we'll see Woo Ri often.

1043
00:57:44,274 --> 00:57:45,843
- Ma Ri. - Yes?

1044
00:57:46,013 --> 00:57:48,053
Don't call her Woo Ri.

1045
00:57:49,414 --> 00:57:50,883
Call her Ms. Oh.

1046
00:57:52,024 --> 00:57:54,453
The drama crew calls her by her name.

1047
00:57:54,854 --> 00:57:56,294
She's just an assistant writer.

1048
00:57:56,694 --> 00:57:59,263
Still, we should call her Ms. Oh.

1049
00:58:00,593 --> 00:58:01,893
Okay.

1050
00:58:01,894 --> 00:58:03,263
Ms. Oh.

1051
00:58:06,234 --> 00:58:07,334
Good.

1052
00:58:08,073 --> 00:58:09,234
Ms. Oh.

1053
00:58:12,774 --> 00:58:14,043
Writer Oh Woo Ri!

1054
00:58:14,044 --> 00:58:15,243
Yes?

1055
00:58:15,843 --> 00:58:18,414
Writer Oh Woo Ri!

1056
00:58:19,544 --> 00:58:20,743
Yes?

1057
00:58:28,453 --> 00:58:29,624
Shoot!

1058
00:58:30,854 --> 00:58:32,363
What is it?

1059
00:58:34,734 --> 00:58:36,294
What's wrong with you?

1060
00:58:42,533 --> 00:58:43,673
Sir.

1061
00:58:44,033 --> 00:58:46,403
Were you at a beach by the East Sea?

1062
00:58:47,973 --> 00:58:49,113
What?

1063
00:58:50,513 --> 00:58:51,883
We met, didn't we?

1064
00:59:28,214 --> 00:59:31,223
(Woori the Virgin)

1065
00:59:31,354 --> 00:59:33,223
Don't open the email!

1066
00:59:33,323 --> 00:59:34,523
There was a letter.

1067
00:59:34,524 --> 00:59:36,854
I didn't know you wanted to get to know me so badly.

1068
00:59:37,453 --> 00:59:38,664
Let's get divorced.

1069
00:59:38,694 --> 00:59:40,794
What if she doesn't give you the baby?

1070
00:59:41,024 --> 00:59:42,234
I'll protect you.

1071
00:59:42,394 --> 00:59:43,793
I can't tell Woo Ri.

1072
00:59:43,794 --> 00:59:46,263
How shocked would she be to know Choi Seoung Il's her dad?

1073
00:59:46,464 --> 00:59:48,334
Can we chat?

1074
00:59:49,104 --> 00:59:50,373
You're leaving? Just like that?

1075
00:59:50,374 --> 00:59:52,144
- Is it Raphael? - Yes.

1076
00:59:52,243 --> 00:59:54,743
Would it be easy to date a woman carrying another man's baby?

1077
00:59:54,914 --> 00:59:56,314
I don't mind at all.

1078
00:59:56,444 --> 00:59:57,743
Let's...

1079
00:59:57,914 --> 00:59:59,214
sleep together.

1080
01:00:04,214 --> 01:00:08,194
