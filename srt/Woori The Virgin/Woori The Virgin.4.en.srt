00:00:34,361 --> 00:00:37,021
(Episode 4)

10
00:00:48,301 --> 00:00:49,472
Sir.

11
00:00:49,741 --> 00:00:52,341
Were you at a beach by the East Sea?

12
00:00:53,012 --> 00:00:54,171
What?

13
00:00:55,612 --> 00:00:57,082
We met, didn't we?

14
00:01:04,921 --> 00:01:06,252
What got into you?

15
00:01:08,462 --> 00:01:09,662
She never went.

16
00:01:10,421 --> 00:01:12,632
She's never been to the East Sea.

17
00:01:17,201 --> 00:01:19,802
You didn't go to the East Sea on a pre-graduation trip?

18
00:01:20,272 --> 00:01:21,641
She didn't.

19
00:01:22,102 --> 00:01:24,372
You met so many women that you got confused.

20
00:01:24,912 --> 00:01:27,611
Woo Ri, you never went, did you?

21
00:01:27,882 --> 00:01:29,042
What?

22
00:01:29,841 --> 00:01:31,212
Sorry to keep you waiting.

23
00:01:34,281 --> 00:01:36,220
Here's the highlight of the East Sea course,

24
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:37,851
plump red snow crab.

25
00:01:37,852 --> 00:01:39,321
It looks delicious.

26
00:01:39,322 --> 00:01:41,762
The squid came in just today.

27
00:01:42,091 --> 00:01:43,992
The best seafood comes from the East Sea.

28
00:01:44,221 --> 00:01:47,632
I'm from there, so I think highly of the East Sea.

29
00:01:47,962 --> 00:01:50,501
Don't you all love the East Sea?

30
00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:52,201
Right?

31
00:01:57,471 --> 00:01:58,872
I don't.

32
00:01:59,872 --> 00:02:01,581
I don't like the East Sea.

33
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:03,941
You don't?

34
00:02:08,721 --> 00:02:10,992
What was that about? You met her before?

35
00:02:12,452 --> 00:02:13,591
A few years back.

36
00:02:14,821 --> 00:02:16,522
I knew she seemed familiar.

37
00:02:17,932 --> 00:02:19,130
What about it?

38
00:02:19,131 --> 00:02:20,832
Did something happen when you met?

39
00:02:21,261 --> 00:02:22,432
Not much.

40
00:02:24,902 --> 00:02:26,872
Then why did she deny it?

41
00:02:28,642 --> 00:02:30,702
It's weird that we met again.

42
00:02:32,172 --> 00:02:35,381
Is this the string of fate people often talk about?

43
00:02:38,751 --> 00:02:40,381
What? What did you say?

44
00:02:40,552 --> 00:02:42,982
- What? - You and Woo Ri are fated?

45
00:02:43,351 --> 00:02:44,892
That's not what I meant.

46
00:02:45,492 --> 00:02:47,760
As if it's not. I heard you.

47
00:02:47,761 --> 00:02:50,091
No. You misheard me.

48
00:02:54,631 --> 00:02:55,862
I'm sorry.

49
00:02:57,031 --> 00:02:58,301
You don't have to be.

50
00:02:58,302 --> 00:03:00,471
I didn't think he'd remember.

51
00:03:02,302 --> 00:03:04,511
I don't mind it at all.

52
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:11,781
I'm sorry.

53
00:03:18,022 --> 00:03:19,152
Sit up.

54
00:03:21,892 --> 00:03:23,161
It's fine.

55
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:37,171
Sorry.

56
00:03:37,172 --> 00:03:38,571
We held hands for too long.

57
00:03:40,112 --> 00:03:41,211
Let's pray later.

58
00:03:41,212 --> 00:03:42,841
Choi Seoung Il's kissing!

59
00:03:58,962 --> 00:04:00,161
Was it you?

60
00:04:01,832 --> 00:04:02,962
Sorry, Mom.

61
00:04:03,202 --> 00:04:04,831
I found out only recently.

62
00:04:04,832 --> 00:04:06,031
He looks different now.

63
00:04:06,332 --> 00:04:07,801
Was it you?

64
00:04:07,802 --> 00:04:09,940
What? Oh, yes. Yes, it's me.

65
00:04:09,941 --> 00:04:11,971
Are you the good-for-nothing punk?

66
00:04:12,142 --> 00:04:13,311
Do you know...

67
00:04:13,612 --> 00:04:14,880
my Eun Ran...

68
00:04:14,881 --> 00:04:16,280
- suffered so much... - Ma'am!

69
00:04:16,281 --> 00:04:17,410
because of you?

70
00:04:17,411 --> 00:04:18,482
Do you?

71
00:04:18,982 --> 00:04:20,111
Will you stop it?

72
00:04:20,112 --> 00:04:21,820
He didn't even know about Woo Ri.

73
00:04:21,821 --> 00:04:23,282
I'm sorry, ma'am.

74
00:04:23,381 --> 00:04:26,750
I will be a good father from now on.

75
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,891
You should be!

76
00:04:28,222 --> 00:04:30,891
Make up for what my daughter and granddaughter lost out on!

77
00:04:31,061 --> 00:04:32,131
But...

78
00:04:33,061 --> 00:04:34,831
I can't tell Woo Ri.

79
00:04:35,461 --> 00:04:37,302
- Why not? - I lost the opportunity to.

80
00:04:38,102 --> 00:04:40,401
Woo Ri grew up thinking her dad was dead.

81
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:42,641
I can't tell her I lied to her all her life.

82
00:04:42,802 --> 00:04:43,841
How shocked would she be...

83
00:04:43,842 --> 00:04:46,211
if she found out that Seoung Il was her dad?

84
00:04:46,612 --> 00:04:47,880
She's stressed out already.

85
00:04:47,881 --> 00:04:49,042
Then what?

86
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:50,611
You won't tell her?

87
00:04:50,612 --> 00:04:51,782
I should.

88
00:04:52,352 --> 00:04:53,881
I'm just waiting for the right time.

89
00:04:56,352 --> 00:04:58,352
I liked you so much.

90
00:04:59,151 --> 00:05:01,292
I watched all of your dramas.

91
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:02,691
And you...

92
00:05:03,092 --> 00:05:04,691
You're my son-in-law?

93
00:05:04,961 --> 00:05:06,932
Mom? He's not your son-in-law.

94
00:05:07,732 --> 00:05:09,261
He's just Woo Ri's dad.

95
00:05:09,932 --> 00:05:11,571
- Yes. - Is that how it is?

96
00:05:12,271 --> 00:05:13,472
Then...

97
00:05:13,831 --> 00:05:15,501
why were you stuck together?

98
00:05:17,242 --> 00:05:18,342
That was...

99
00:05:18,472 --> 00:05:19,611
- an accident. - Yes.

100
00:05:19,612 --> 00:05:20,841
You fools.

101
00:05:20,842 --> 00:05:23,380
You're that much older but you still haven't grown up?

102
00:05:23,381 --> 00:05:25,010
- Oh, gosh, no! - Mom, no!

103
00:05:25,011 --> 00:05:26,351
- Please don't. - Let go of me.

104
00:05:26,352 --> 00:05:28,151
Just not my face, please.

105
00:05:31,922 --> 00:05:33,092
When did you come in?

106
00:05:35,422 --> 00:05:37,491
Hey, you're... Byeon Jin.

107
00:05:37,492 --> 00:05:38,662
Don't call him that.

108
00:05:38,891 --> 00:05:41,302
Greet him properly. He's a CEO.

109
00:05:42,261 --> 00:05:44,602
You are? A CEO? Of what company?

110
00:05:47,732 --> 00:05:50,771
I'm Jeon Byeon Jin, CEO of Diamond Cosmetics.

111
00:05:58,451 --> 00:06:00,150
- Father? - I told you to...

112
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:01,751
focus on the hospital.

113
00:06:02,151 --> 00:06:03,650
You said you'd work on cosmetics too,

114
00:06:03,651 --> 00:06:06,352
but you ruined an event,

115
00:06:06,451 --> 00:06:08,592
someone died, and it was on the news.

116
00:06:09,021 --> 00:06:10,662
Hospital sales plummeted.

117
00:06:10,792 --> 00:06:14,661
Still, you can't replace a CEO so fast, without a board meeting.

118
00:06:14,662 --> 00:06:16,001
As of today, he's the CEO.

119
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,172
You're an executive director.

120
00:06:21,302 --> 00:06:22,441
Mr. Kim.

121
00:06:23,271 --> 00:06:24,612
I hope we get along.

122
00:06:28,482 --> 00:06:31,010
Father, you're taking this prank too far.

123
00:06:31,011 --> 00:06:32,482
- It's not a prank. - What?

124
00:06:32,711 --> 00:06:34,380
It's not, and you really want a new CEO?

125
00:06:34,381 --> 00:06:36,222
When I'm right here? I'm the CEO.

126
00:06:36,282 --> 00:06:38,291
Do you still think this is a game?

127
00:06:38,292 --> 00:06:41,260
Where you get what you want by pleading?

128
00:06:41,261 --> 00:06:42,960
I built up the hospital from scratch!

129
00:06:42,961 --> 00:06:44,992
You didn't build up anything!

130
00:06:46,391 --> 00:06:48,031
Mom opened the hospital.

131
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:50,531
If it hadn't been for me, it would still be a small clinic.

132
00:06:50,532 --> 00:06:53,271
I turned it into a conglomerate, so it's mine!

133
00:06:56,872 --> 00:06:58,971
I have ideas too. Give me some time.

134
00:06:58,972 --> 00:07:00,641
On Monday, Jeon Byeon Jin...

135
00:07:01,511 --> 00:07:03,011
will give a presentation on entering China.

136
00:07:04,182 --> 00:07:05,182
I offered him a position in the hospital,

137
00:07:05,183 --> 00:07:06,912
but he fancied being the CEO of Cosmetics.

138
00:07:07,311 --> 00:07:08,581
Are you interested?

139
00:07:08,951 --> 00:07:11,182
Good! Then we'll discuss it then.

140
00:07:11,592 --> 00:07:14,251
If you have an idea to change my mind, even better.

141
00:07:16,122 --> 00:07:17,292
Jeon Byeon Jin?

142
00:07:19,391 --> 00:07:20,691
What's that punk doing here?

143
00:07:21,831 --> 00:07:23,662
Why are you CEO?

144
00:07:24,001 --> 00:07:25,770
I'm CEO as of today.

145
00:07:25,771 --> 00:07:27,201
Your husband's an executive director.

146
00:07:29,302 --> 00:07:30,441
Are you...

147
00:07:30,701 --> 00:07:33,042
doing this to get back at me?

148
00:07:36,011 --> 00:07:38,081
You're getting ahead of yourself.

149
00:07:38,982 --> 00:07:41,282
I'm no longer the loser who tried to win you back.

150
00:07:58,201 --> 00:08:01,102
Didn't you ditch me for Raphael because he was the chairman's son?

151
00:08:01,501 --> 00:08:02,972
That's nonsense!

152
00:08:03,042 --> 00:08:04,302
Things will get interesting.

153
00:08:04,872 --> 00:08:08,242
If I take over Diamond Cosmetics and the hospital too,

154
00:08:08,511 --> 00:08:10,811
I wonder what look you'll have on your face then.

155
00:08:11,852 --> 00:08:13,052
Dream on.

156
00:08:20,891 --> 00:08:21,991
Shall we check it out?

157
00:08:21,992 --> 00:08:23,092
- Excuse me. - Okay.

158
00:08:23,821 --> 00:08:25,362
Did you drive?

159
00:08:25,461 --> 00:08:26,592
Shall I give you a ride?

160
00:08:29,331 --> 00:08:31,701
Is it you or me? Shall we bet?

161
00:08:32,401 --> 00:08:34,172
He's not in your age range.

162
00:08:38,712 --> 00:08:41,171
Sorry, but I have a boyfriend.

163
00:08:42,212 --> 00:08:43,410
And a baby.

164
00:08:43,411 --> 00:08:44,482
Excuse me.

165
00:08:45,312 --> 00:08:46,511
I asked your sister.

166
00:08:48,681 --> 00:08:49,781
See?

167
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:53,091
I'm her mom...

168
00:08:53,092 --> 00:08:54,391
and soon-to-be grandma.

169
00:08:56,222 --> 00:08:58,092
You're both great liars.

170
00:08:58,492 --> 00:08:59,692
Goodbye.

171
00:09:04,362 --> 00:09:06,401
Should we have let him give us a ride?

172
00:09:06,572 --> 00:09:08,342
Do you want to be like that?

173
00:09:09,072 --> 00:09:11,300
Why did you buy so much stuff?

174
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:13,112
What kind of food are you packing?

175
00:09:13,612 --> 00:09:16,982
Stuff keeps happening that I have to apologize to Kang Jae for.

176
00:09:18,051 --> 00:09:20,612
I get it. He's a Buddhist saint.

177
00:09:21,082 --> 00:09:22,221
"Buddhist saint"?

178
00:09:22,222 --> 00:09:23,851
He goes to church.

179
00:09:23,852 --> 00:09:25,321
Think about it.

180
00:09:25,322 --> 00:09:27,891
Would it be easy to date a woman carrying another man's baby?

181
00:09:28,992 --> 00:09:32,092
You're not Michael and Jane who live in Florida.

182
00:09:32,161 --> 00:09:34,592
Do you think Koreans could accept this?

183
00:09:34,901 --> 00:09:36,202
I know.

184
00:09:36,661 --> 00:09:39,301
That's why I feel terrible and grateful to Kang Jae.

185
00:09:40,232 --> 00:09:42,702
He might as well be a living Buddha.

186
00:09:43,472 --> 00:09:44,741
Amen.

187
00:09:44,742 --> 00:09:46,872
I can't say he's Jesus, can I?

188
00:09:51,011 --> 00:09:53,952
I don't get why there are so many problems.

189
00:09:56,151 --> 00:09:57,352
Come on.

190
00:09:57,582 --> 00:10:00,222
Try to think on the bright side.

191
00:10:00,722 --> 00:10:01,921
Mom.

192
00:10:02,122 --> 00:10:04,722
I'm a virgin who got pregnant because a doctor messed up.

193
00:10:05,092 --> 00:10:07,030
I confessed to being pregnant when Kang Jae proposed,

194
00:10:07,031 --> 00:10:08,301
and the baby's dad is...

195
00:10:11,401 --> 00:10:13,101
It's no small deal for me,

196
00:10:13,102 --> 00:10:15,641
and it's a lot for the people around me to take in.

197
00:10:15,972 --> 00:10:17,572
So what bright side are you talking about?

198
00:10:18,612 --> 00:10:21,982
Oh. You don't have to save yourself anymore.

199
00:10:22,212 --> 00:10:24,581
- What do you mean? - Think about it.

200
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,711
What saving is there to do if you're already pregnant?

201
00:10:26,712 --> 00:10:28,681
You don't need to stay a virgin.

202
00:10:28,781 --> 00:10:30,421
People would laugh if they heard.

203
00:10:30,751 --> 00:10:34,051
Even if you're pregnant, if you're careful, you can have fun.

204
00:10:34,891 --> 00:10:36,622
Don't be silly, Mom.

205
00:10:42,501 --> 00:10:44,732
Wow. It's so pretty.

206
00:10:44,832 --> 00:10:46,801
Eat the food already.

207
00:10:46,832 --> 00:10:48,401
I'll enjoy it. Thank you.

208
00:10:50,602 --> 00:10:51,641
Ta-Da.

209
00:10:52,342 --> 00:10:53,671
It's too cute.

210
00:10:57,011 --> 00:10:59,781
Kang Jae. Did you watch "Home Alone"?

211
00:10:59,982 --> 00:11:02,082
Yes. Every Christmas.

212
00:11:02,852 --> 00:11:04,251
The kid says...

213
00:11:04,722 --> 00:11:07,091
he didn't go skating to save his skates,

214
00:11:07,092 --> 00:11:09,322
but then he grew out of them.

215
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:15,062
That's how I feel right now.

216
00:11:15,332 --> 00:11:16,531
What do you mean?

217
00:11:18,102 --> 00:11:21,171
I don't get why I bothered to save myself for marriage.

218
00:11:22,942 --> 00:11:26,242
Why... What are you saying, Woo Ri?

219
00:11:27,072 --> 00:11:30,482
No, I'm fine. I'll think on the bright side.

220
00:11:31,381 --> 00:11:34,281
Right? That's my Woo Ri.

221
00:11:59,812 --> 00:12:02,082
So, Woo Ri.

222
00:12:02,942 --> 00:12:03,982
What?

223
00:12:04,242 --> 00:12:05,312
This.

224
00:12:08,681 --> 00:12:11,082
Oh, gosh. Sorry.

225
00:12:13,222 --> 00:12:15,692
You have something on there.

226
00:12:18,391 --> 00:12:19,761
I should go.

227
00:12:20,092 --> 00:12:21,461
You're leaving? Just like that?

228
00:12:21,462 --> 00:12:23,832
Bye. See you.

229
00:12:24,301 --> 00:12:27,131
Pregnancy causes increased oestrogen, heightening your sex drive. Shoot.

230
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:29,442
An Adam's apple?

231
00:12:30,301 --> 00:12:33,241
Isn't it weird to get turned on by someone's Adam's apple?

232
00:12:33,242 --> 00:12:35,411
No. That's cool.

233
00:12:35,812 --> 00:12:37,780
There are people who like Adam's apples?

234
00:12:37,781 --> 00:12:38,811
Or course.

235
00:12:38,812 --> 00:12:41,082
It's something only men have.

236
00:12:41,212 --> 00:12:43,521
Nice... The Adam's apple...

237
00:12:44,482 --> 00:12:46,021
It's kind of sexy.

238
00:12:46,622 --> 00:12:49,092
Oh, it is. Thank goodness.

239
00:12:50,192 --> 00:12:52,592
Then how do we seduce Na Beom In?

240
00:12:53,161 --> 00:12:55,301
- Well. - I mean...

241
00:12:55,602 --> 00:12:57,400
She has to...

242
00:12:57,401 --> 00:13:00,231
seduce a man who isn't interested.

243
00:13:00,232 --> 00:13:02,072
Sex appeal.

244
00:13:03,102 --> 00:13:04,670
Yes, that.

245
00:13:04,671 --> 00:13:07,111
How can you not even say the word "sex"?

246
00:13:07,112 --> 00:13:09,781
Listen to me. Here's the basic concept.

247
00:13:09,881 --> 00:13:13,451
It may be hard to find true love with a man.

248
00:13:13,452 --> 00:13:15,881
But all you want is a physical tryst.

249
00:13:16,651 --> 00:13:20,592
A woman can get what she wants if she just sets her mind to it.

250
00:13:20,751 --> 00:13:23,261
- How? - Text a man three words.

251
00:13:23,661 --> 00:13:25,232
"Let's sleep together."

252
00:13:25,592 --> 00:13:28,961
Even a man in Busan will take a taxi to your door in three hours.

253
00:13:28,962 --> 00:13:31,731
That's way too direct.

254
00:13:31,732 --> 00:13:35,141
Well, of course, there are more complicated ways.

255
00:13:35,901 --> 00:13:37,702
Shall I share my foolproof strategy?

256
00:13:38,072 --> 00:13:39,072
Yes.

257
00:13:42,712 --> 00:13:44,881
Assault him in this order, nose, eyes, skin.

258
00:13:45,082 --> 00:13:46,151
First, attack his nose.

259
00:13:46,712 --> 00:13:49,421
Wear a subtle perfume.

260
00:13:49,622 --> 00:13:52,451
Don't drench yourself so you smell from a mile away.

261
00:13:52,452 --> 00:13:55,462
He doesn't smell anything at first, but when he gets close...

262
00:13:55,962 --> 00:13:58,291
and smells a subtle perfume,

263
00:13:58,661 --> 00:14:00,430
he'll wonder what it is.

264
00:14:00,431 --> 00:14:03,562
He'll sniff around to see what it is and where it's from.

265
00:14:04,232 --> 00:14:06,631
Okay, what's the second one?

266
00:14:07,732 --> 00:14:10,301
Flip your hair and show the side of your neck.

267
00:14:11,001 --> 00:14:13,511
This is something I don't tell just anyone.

268
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:15,411
I'll tell just you.

269
00:14:16,482 --> 00:14:18,911
Cross your arms like this.

270
00:14:19,051 --> 00:14:22,251
Pull up your boobs and be sure to put your soul into it.

271
00:14:22,921 --> 00:14:24,151
Just like this.

272
00:14:24,421 --> 00:14:25,592
Then lean in like this with this gaze.

273
00:14:30,622 --> 00:14:33,531
Number three, skin.

274
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:37,231
This is confirmation.

275
00:14:37,232 --> 00:14:38,670
We just linked arms.

276
00:14:38,671 --> 00:14:39,931
It's not just that.

277
00:14:42,972 --> 00:14:44,241
That's gross!

278
00:14:44,242 --> 00:14:47,541
That's the touchy-feely part. Okay?

279
00:14:48,112 --> 00:14:50,281
Are you sure about this? Taken from experience?

280
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:52,482
Put that in the script.

281
00:14:54,551 --> 00:14:56,881
Just type what I said.

282
00:14:57,452 --> 00:15:00,291
I'll work on the next plot line.

283
00:15:00,421 --> 00:15:02,421
Kang Jae. Where are you going?

284
00:15:03,362 --> 00:15:05,261
To ask Lee Ma Ri to come in.

285
00:15:06,031 --> 00:15:07,631
Is that why you're so glum?

286
00:15:08,761 --> 00:15:11,361
Even I think it's not her.

287
00:15:11,362 --> 00:15:12,732
She has an alibi.

288
00:15:13,102 --> 00:15:14,801
It's Chairman Kim.

289
00:15:15,401 --> 00:15:16,771
Do you have proof?

290
00:15:17,442 --> 00:15:18,742
It's a detective's hunch.

291
00:15:19,472 --> 00:15:22,281
Didn't you see me get chewed out for saying that?

292
00:15:22,742 --> 00:15:24,482
I can't back it up.

293
00:15:26,082 --> 00:15:28,181
I wish we could find the camera hard drive.

294
00:15:28,582 --> 00:15:30,822
- I'll keep looking. - Don't bother.

295
00:15:31,251 --> 00:15:34,421
How can we find something that wasn't even in the trash?

296
00:15:35,562 --> 00:15:36,661
I have to go.

297
00:15:38,761 --> 00:15:39,962
Hello.

298
00:15:40,592 --> 00:15:43,232
Thank you for visiting our hospital.

299
00:15:45,931 --> 00:15:47,232
What are you doing?

300
00:15:47,671 --> 00:15:49,202
What if someone sees?

301
00:15:50,141 --> 00:15:52,671
You need to come in tomorrow.

302
00:15:53,842 --> 00:15:55,280
Must you do this?

303
00:15:55,281 --> 00:15:57,212
You must agree to the investigation.

304
00:15:57,411 --> 00:15:58,711
There's no evidence.

305
00:15:58,712 --> 00:16:00,811
Find something, then.

306
00:16:00,812 --> 00:16:03,151
You have until tomorrow before I must come in.

307
00:16:08,562 --> 00:16:10,921
Where's the waste from Diamond Hospital?

308
00:16:11,562 --> 00:16:13,791
The police asked the exact same thing.

309
00:16:14,332 --> 00:16:16,332
We don't know what hospital it is from.

310
00:16:16,761 --> 00:16:18,062
What are you looking for?

311
00:16:18,362 --> 00:16:20,572
It's a violent crimes case, and I'm in need of evidence.

312
00:16:21,901 --> 00:16:25,372
We burn everything once a week, so it could still be here.

313
00:16:26,472 --> 00:16:28,242
You can't look in there.

314
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:31,541
Used syringes, bloody gauze, there are all sorts of stuff.

315
00:16:32,181 --> 00:16:34,082
You could catch a lot of things from it.

316
00:16:34,251 --> 00:16:35,722
It's not safe.

317
00:16:36,181 --> 00:16:38,891
If it's that kind of waste...

318
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,291
I'm looking for a hard disk this big.

319
00:16:43,062 --> 00:16:44,492
Can I take a look?

320
00:16:53,631 --> 00:16:56,101
Who gave you permission to go in there?

321
00:16:56,102 --> 00:16:58,071
- Get out! It's not safe! - Okay!

322
00:16:58,072 --> 00:17:00,011
Are you out of your mind?

323
00:17:00,271 --> 00:17:02,380
- I said to get out! - Okay, I'm coming.

324
00:17:02,381 --> 00:17:03,641
I'm done looking.

325
00:17:06,212 --> 00:17:08,822
Will you get out already?

326
00:17:09,252 --> 00:17:10,282
Hang on.

327
00:17:26,931 --> 00:17:28,401
Do your best work.

328
00:17:30,401 --> 00:17:32,441
Kang Jae. How does the drive look?

329
00:17:32,941 --> 00:17:35,812
It is the hard disk with footage from the elevator cameras.

330
00:17:35,981 --> 00:17:38,511
Some data was lost, and it was physically damaged,

331
00:17:38,512 --> 00:17:39,581
so it'll take a while.

332
00:17:39,582 --> 00:17:40,751
Can it be restored?

333
00:17:40,752 --> 00:17:43,721
He said he'd do his best. So let's wait and see.

334
00:17:45,451 --> 00:17:48,092
If we can get the files...

335
00:17:49,062 --> 00:17:51,391
Well done, Kang Jae.

336
00:17:54,292 --> 00:17:56,031
Aren't you drinking too much?

337
00:17:56,032 --> 00:17:58,401
Let her be. She's off the clock.

338
00:17:58,572 --> 00:17:59,730
I'll drive today.

339
00:17:59,731 --> 00:18:01,872
You're the best, Kang Jae.

340
00:18:02,241 --> 00:18:03,670
You should learn from him.

341
00:18:03,671 --> 00:18:07,011
What more must I learn? I went to graduate school.

342
00:18:07,012 --> 00:18:10,211
Learn to be warm and caring to your junior officers.

343
00:18:12,052 --> 00:18:13,552
I might as well say it.

344
00:18:14,681 --> 00:18:18,622
I volunteered to join Violent Crimes because of you.

345
00:18:18,951 --> 00:18:21,391
Because of me? Why?

346
00:18:21,491 --> 00:18:24,792
I watched you when I was in Traffic,

347
00:18:26,391 --> 00:18:29,532
and you looked like a wild stallion.

348
00:18:31,431 --> 00:18:34,032
You didn't look that well groomed,

349
00:18:34,631 --> 00:18:36,302
but your eyes shone brightly.

350
00:18:37,102 --> 00:18:39,741
"Yes. I want to be a detective like that."

351
00:18:40,641 --> 00:18:42,881
"Not a civil servant that goes through parking tickets."

352
00:18:43,681 --> 00:18:45,141
"Let's become a detective."

353
00:18:45,552 --> 00:18:47,681
You ruined her life.

354
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:50,381
My life is not ruined.

355
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:52,022
Oh, my head's ringing.

356
00:18:52,622 --> 00:18:53,691
What?

357
00:18:54,252 --> 00:18:56,721
It must be nice to be you. You're so popular.

358
00:18:57,461 --> 00:18:59,832
Look at that grin. Enjoy it while you can.

359
00:19:00,161 --> 00:19:01,832
You'll be my age soon.

360
00:19:02,862 --> 00:19:05,970
Captain. Did I tell you why I joined Violent Crimes?

361
00:19:05,971 --> 00:19:08,301
- I don't know. - That time.

362
00:19:08,302 --> 00:19:10,471
You were the team's ace.

363
00:19:11,072 --> 00:19:13,372
I thought you were a wild stallion.

364
00:19:14,272 --> 00:19:17,312
I joined the team to be like you.

365
00:19:19,381 --> 00:19:20,481
It's yours.

366
00:19:20,711 --> 00:19:23,022
I was saved by the bell.

367
00:19:26,622 --> 00:19:28,660
If you sleep like that...

368
00:19:28,661 --> 00:19:30,991
You'll catch a cold.

369
00:19:40,701 --> 00:19:43,401
Yes, sure. Coming right up.

370
00:19:43,542 --> 00:19:45,200
- Yes? - Hurry up.

371
00:19:45,201 --> 00:19:47,611
Well done, son.

372
00:19:47,612 --> 00:19:49,241
Keep going.

373
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:53,812
Oh, did you? Good boy.

374
00:19:54,352 --> 00:19:55,782
Well done.

375
00:20:04,792 --> 00:20:05,891
Hey.

376
00:20:06,491 --> 00:20:08,561
You should go behind and find out the escape route.

377
00:20:08,562 --> 00:20:09,601
I'll pick the lock and go in.

378
00:20:09,602 --> 00:20:10,701
You punk.

379
00:20:11,562 --> 00:20:13,072
I'm going in first.

380
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:16,441
Kang Jae, be careful.

381
00:20:19,411 --> 00:20:20,611
Wake up!

382
00:20:20,612 --> 00:20:23,342
Jun Suk.

383
00:20:24,842 --> 00:20:26,352
Jun Suk!

384
00:20:27,151 --> 00:20:28,721
Jun Suk! Wake up.

385
00:20:33,092 --> 00:20:35,221
Jun Suk.

386
00:20:39,092 --> 00:20:40,491
Chairman Kim!

387
00:20:41,631 --> 00:20:44,002
Chairman Kim!

388
00:21:00,411 --> 00:21:01,651
Don't cry.

389
00:21:05,691 --> 00:21:07,122
It's all right.

390
00:21:09,022 --> 00:21:10,191
Kang Jae.

391
00:21:11,792 --> 00:21:14,161
Salute. Detective Lee, you're here.

392
00:21:14,461 --> 00:21:15,631
Hello, Ms. Yu.

393
00:21:16,131 --> 00:21:18,332
Would you like to have dinner with us?

394
00:21:19,201 --> 00:21:22,372
There's a struggle between the one who invited and the one who didn't.

395
00:21:23,542 --> 00:21:25,910
Ye Ri, we'll just have dinner, the two of us.

396
00:21:25,911 --> 00:21:27,842
All right, I'll go away. Have fun you two.

397
00:21:28,441 --> 00:21:29,911
You can come with us...

398
00:21:30,042 --> 00:21:31,312
Bye.

399
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:34,381
She can really come with us.

400
00:21:52,401 --> 00:21:54,131
I thought I was dying of thirst.

401
00:21:54,872 --> 00:21:56,072
You need to eat, don't you?

402
00:21:57,241 --> 00:21:59,041
What?

403
00:21:59,042 --> 00:22:00,342
Let's go eat dinner.

404
00:22:00,572 --> 00:22:01,941
Where shall we go? What would you like to eat?

405
00:22:05,711 --> 00:22:08,082
Can we skip our regular place...

406
00:22:09,721 --> 00:22:11,720
and go to your place?

407
00:22:11,721 --> 00:22:12,991
My place? All of a sudden?

408
00:22:15,421 --> 00:22:17,762
You've never been to my place.

409
00:22:18,721 --> 00:22:20,890
Wait, there's nothing to eat in my place.

410
00:22:20,891 --> 00:22:21,960
We can order in.

411
00:22:21,961 --> 00:22:23,431
We can't have delivery food.

412
00:22:26,572 --> 00:22:28,072
I have some clams at home.

413
00:22:28,532 --> 00:22:29,741
Should I make you some pasta?

414
00:22:30,002 --> 00:22:31,101
Yes.

415
00:22:31,102 --> 00:22:33,970
Gosh, I don't think that's going to work. It's a mess at home.

416
00:22:33,971 --> 00:22:35,112
Let's go next time.

417
00:22:35,272 --> 00:22:36,312
It's okay.

418
00:22:37,211 --> 00:22:39,481
What is Woo Ri?

419
00:22:44,852 --> 00:22:47,151
How's it going, Kang Jae?

420
00:22:47,252 --> 00:22:48,322
Do you want me to help you?

421
00:22:48,491 --> 00:22:49,891
Go and sit down.

422
00:22:52,022 --> 00:22:53,160
First, scent.

423
00:22:53,161 --> 00:22:55,092
Gently wear perfume.

424
00:22:58,701 --> 00:22:59,802
Kang Jae,

425
00:23:00,572 --> 00:23:02,401
- can't you smell something? - What?

426
00:23:05,042 --> 00:23:06,141
I'm sorry.

427
00:23:06,411 --> 00:23:08,741
I told you my place was a mess and that we should come next time.

428
00:23:12,582 --> 00:23:14,650
I smell my burning heart.

429
00:23:14,651 --> 00:23:16,221
What? Something's burning?

430
00:23:20,352 --> 00:23:21,491
Is it burnt?

431
00:23:22,522 --> 00:23:23,622
Never mind.

432
00:23:24,122 --> 00:23:25,322
I'll sit over there.

433
00:23:25,792 --> 00:23:27,191
Right. I'll be there soon.

434
00:23:32,772 --> 00:23:33,871
Second, sight.

435
00:23:33,872 --> 00:23:35,302
Push up everything you can.

436
00:23:37,641 --> 00:23:38,971
Kang Jae.

437
00:23:39,171 --> 00:23:40,211
Yes?

438
00:23:44,812 --> 00:23:46,782
- Kang Jae. - Right, I'm almost done.

439
00:23:49,322 --> 00:23:51,451
Woo Ri, are you all right?

440
00:23:54,022 --> 00:23:55,352
- Get up. Are you okay? - Yes.

441
00:23:57,022 --> 00:23:58,062
Are you hurt?

442
00:24:00,262 --> 00:24:01,592
This is a foldable table.

443
00:24:03,002 --> 00:24:04,961
How was it? Did you enjoy it?

444
00:24:05,201 --> 00:24:07,532
Yes. It's so delicious. I'm done.

445
00:24:08,731 --> 00:24:12,072
- Do you want more? - It's okay. I'm full.

446
00:24:12,471 --> 00:24:13,812
Then, I'll go get you some tea.

447
00:24:15,641 --> 00:24:16,811
- Kang Jae. - Yes?

448
00:24:16,812 --> 00:24:17,881
Take a seat.

449
00:24:18,542 --> 00:24:19,681
What is it?

450
00:24:22,782 --> 00:24:24,082
Third, touch.

451
00:24:24,552 --> 00:24:26,951
Execution.

452
00:24:27,622 --> 00:24:30,092
I didn't know you were so good at cooking.

453
00:24:33,991 --> 00:24:35,431
I should've asked you to make me something earlier.

454
00:24:37,032 --> 00:24:38,731
I wanted to,

455
00:24:38,901 --> 00:24:40,701
but they said it was dangerous for us to be alone at home.

456
00:24:42,201 --> 00:24:44,572
Why? What's so dangerous?

457
00:24:48,542 --> 00:24:50,842
Something just...

458
00:24:52,082 --> 00:24:53,211
Why?

459
00:24:54,252 --> 00:24:55,651
No, nothing.

460
00:24:56,421 --> 00:24:58,622
Woo Ri, let's go.

461
00:24:58,651 --> 00:25:00,221
Let's have tea elsewhere.

462
00:25:00,292 --> 00:25:02,690
You said you'd make me some tea.

463
00:25:02,691 --> 00:25:04,961
No, we should leave quickly.

464
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:08,562
Why? I want to stay here longer.

465
00:25:09,231 --> 00:25:11,532
I don't think it's a good day for me.

466
00:25:11,762 --> 00:25:12,872
I think I need to pray.

467
00:25:34,651 --> 00:25:35,961
What?

468
00:25:36,421 --> 00:25:37,720
Why? What is it?

469
00:25:37,721 --> 00:25:40,332
Something just came in...

470
00:25:40,862 --> 00:25:42,062
What?

471
00:25:49,772 --> 00:25:52,812
You know that scene where Ji Dok Sa tries to charm Na Beom In?

472
00:25:53,641 --> 00:25:56,381
What if Na Beom In is dense and can't notice it?

473
00:25:56,842 --> 00:25:59,211
What if smell, sight, and touch won't do the trick?

474
00:25:59,352 --> 00:26:00,981
Why would that be a problem?

475
00:26:01,381 --> 00:26:02,880
You just need to say it.

476
00:26:02,881 --> 00:26:04,481
"Let's sleep together". Done.

477
00:26:05,792 --> 00:26:06,920
That's a bit...

478
00:26:06,921 --> 00:26:08,122
Do you want to write a letter then?

479
00:26:08,221 --> 00:26:09,821
"My love for you is great..."

480
00:26:09,822 --> 00:26:12,292
"hence I'd like to request a sleepover on this date."

481
00:26:12,461 --> 00:26:13,631
What is this, Joseon Dynasty?

482
00:26:17,401 --> 00:26:18,701
Letter? That's a good idea.

483
00:26:19,171 --> 00:26:20,631
In scene 34,

484
00:26:21,272 --> 00:26:23,671
could you add a line about...

485
00:26:23,802 --> 00:26:27,012
the brightening essence?

486
00:26:36,221 --> 00:26:37,321
That sounds good.

487
00:26:37,322 --> 00:26:39,491
All right, I'll put in a line about the product.

488
00:26:39,721 --> 00:26:42,861
Scene 34, a line about brightening essence.

489
00:26:42,862 --> 00:26:44,092
Add in a line about brightening essence.

490
00:26:44,262 --> 00:26:45,420
Why is she adding in everything?

491
00:26:45,421 --> 00:26:47,891
Everyone seems to be doing hard work.

492
00:26:48,032 --> 00:26:50,502
Hello, Chief, Director, and Team Leader.

493
00:26:51,802 --> 00:26:53,431
There are some new faces as well.

494
00:26:53,931 --> 00:26:55,072
Nice to meet you.

495
00:26:55,302 --> 00:26:59,312
I'm the new CEO of Diamond Cosmetics, Jeon Byeon Jin.

496
00:27:00,112 --> 00:27:01,312
Have some while you are working.

497
00:27:02,342 --> 00:27:04,312
Executive Director Raphael,

498
00:27:05,082 --> 00:27:06,252
keep up the good work.

499
00:27:06,951 --> 00:27:08,052
How are things going?

500
00:27:13,451 --> 00:27:14,991
Ms. Oh, you're still here.

501
00:27:15,451 --> 00:27:17,660
Ms. Yu wanted to get a facial.

502
00:27:17,661 --> 00:27:19,791
Why didn't you get it as well?

503
00:27:19,792 --> 00:27:22,231
No, I'm fine.

504
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:35,441
Ms. Oh,

505
00:27:38,342 --> 00:27:39,411
I put you in a difficult position...

506
00:27:40,211 --> 00:27:41,411
the other day, didn't I?

507
00:27:41,512 --> 00:27:42,721
I was so worked up...

508
00:27:43,322 --> 00:27:46,151
and shouldn't have blurted about our meeting before.

509
00:27:47,822 --> 00:27:49,022
I'm sorry.

510
00:27:51,292 --> 00:27:53,230
Did you recognize me,

511
00:27:53,231 --> 00:27:54,391
when you first saw me?

512
00:27:55,461 --> 00:27:56,602
- Yes. - Oh...

513
00:27:58,431 --> 00:28:00,802
Who was that man that brought coffee earlier?

514
00:28:02,231 --> 00:28:04,701
He's the new management specialist.

515
00:28:07,241 --> 00:28:08,612
Were you fired?

516
00:28:10,542 --> 00:28:13,450
That can't be changed that easily.

517
00:28:13,451 --> 00:28:14,981
We need to have an official board meeting and all.

518
00:28:15,352 --> 00:28:17,052
Right.

519
00:28:18,322 --> 00:28:19,622
Ms. Oh,

520
00:28:20,552 --> 00:28:21,821
would you like to write...

521
00:28:21,822 --> 00:28:22,990
an introduction letter for the hospital?

522
00:28:22,991 --> 00:28:26,091
Not the formal kind that the marketing team writes,

523
00:28:26,092 --> 00:28:28,661
but a creative one that is not tied to a particular format.

524
00:28:29,431 --> 00:28:31,332
Can't you write a fun one for me?

525
00:28:31,862 --> 00:28:34,671
Sure, it's not that difficult.

526
00:28:35,002 --> 00:28:36,071
Thanks.

527
00:28:36,072 --> 00:28:38,741
And did you see the film crew?

528
00:28:38,901 --> 00:28:40,611
Hello.

529
00:28:40,612 --> 00:28:42,512
Got you!

530
00:28:45,441 --> 00:28:47,180
- Hello. - Hi.

531
00:28:47,181 --> 00:28:50,421
Ms. Oh, we should meet more often.

532
00:28:51,151 --> 00:28:52,480
Right,

533
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:54,721
I don't come out to shoots that often.

534
00:28:56,262 --> 00:28:57,660
Bye, then.

535
00:28:57,661 --> 00:28:59,122
Wait.

536
00:29:06,431 --> 00:29:08,102
You'll have good things ahead of you.

537
00:29:08,671 --> 00:29:09,971
Cheer up.

538
00:29:10,102 --> 00:29:11,171
Let's go!

539
00:29:11,471 --> 00:29:12,572
Let's go!

540
00:29:13,842 --> 00:29:15,210
Bye.

541
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:16,481
Wait.

542
00:29:20,782 --> 00:29:21,852
Can...

543
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:28,451
we take a picture together?

544
00:29:29,052 --> 00:29:30,821
- Excuse me? - You like it too, don't you?

545
00:29:30,822 --> 00:29:32,690
No, I'm fine.

546
00:29:32,691 --> 00:29:33,791
It's okay. I'm okay.

547
00:29:33,792 --> 00:29:34,961
You like taking pictures, don't you?

548
00:29:35,032 --> 00:29:36,231
Here we go.

549
00:29:36,532 --> 00:29:39,130
Have a good day everyone.

550
00:29:39,131 --> 00:29:40,731
See you, soon.

551
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:49,581
Writer Woo Ri?

552
00:29:49,582 --> 00:29:50,711
First picture together?

553
00:29:51,512 --> 00:29:52,650
Have you lost your mind?

554
00:29:52,651 --> 00:29:53,752
Woo Ri is not a stranger.

555
00:29:54,112 --> 00:29:55,552
Woo Ri is my daughter.

556
00:29:55,612 --> 00:29:57,082
Seriously, why are you being this way?

557
00:29:57,782 --> 00:29:59,720
Just wait until I say something to her.

558
00:29:59,721 --> 00:30:00,950
How many times do I have to tell you?

559
00:30:00,951 --> 00:30:03,092
What did I say?

560
00:30:03,191 --> 00:30:04,621
I didn't go looking for her.

561
00:30:04,622 --> 00:30:06,230
I just met her on set.

562
00:30:06,231 --> 00:30:07,791
Can't I even do that?

563
00:30:07,792 --> 00:30:09,400
Can I not meet her by coincidence?

564
00:30:09,401 --> 00:30:12,262
Don't make me so nervous. Bye.

565
00:30:19,072 --> 00:30:21,211
Gosh.

566
00:30:22,542 --> 00:30:23,812
I'm so lonely.

567
00:30:25,512 --> 00:30:26,681
I'm so lonely.

568
00:30:35,451 --> 00:30:36,961
I didn't think you'd come.

569
00:30:37,461 --> 00:30:39,362
You said you'd wait until I did.

570
00:30:41,691 --> 00:30:42,802
Ma Ri.

571
00:30:43,602 --> 00:30:44,961
What is it that you want to say?

572
00:30:45,461 --> 00:30:48,231
I made a hard decision to clear my feelings for you.

573
00:30:49,842 --> 00:30:53,311
But I'm having second thoughts, seeing you like this.

574
00:30:53,312 --> 00:30:54,512
What's wrong with me?

575
00:30:55,441 --> 00:30:59,141
Didn't you say you were no longer the loser Jeon Byeon Jin anymore?

576
00:31:00,181 --> 00:31:01,252
What if I cling on?

577
00:31:02,211 --> 00:31:03,521
Will you take me back, then?

578
00:31:03,522 --> 00:31:04,950
I'm married.

579
00:31:04,951 --> 00:31:08,352
Didn't you get married to a CEO and not to a husband?

580
00:31:08,421 --> 00:31:10,022
I'm the new CEO.

581
00:31:10,421 --> 00:31:12,160
I'm going to take over this hospital.

582
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:13,391
Come back to me.

583
00:31:15,661 --> 00:31:18,431
What is it? What is your plan?

584
00:31:19,102 --> 00:31:21,571
I heard you mentioned expanding into China.

585
00:31:21,572 --> 00:31:24,741
There's this big hospital called Liang Li Mao Mei Plastic Surgery.

586
00:31:24,872 --> 00:31:27,112
They are helping us with the expansion.

587
00:31:27,241 --> 00:31:28,572
They want to do a joint hospital with us.

588
00:31:29,112 --> 00:31:31,311
If I take over all the China shares,

589
00:31:31,312 --> 00:31:34,951
I'll get rid of Kim Duk Bae and Raphael in no time.

590
00:31:38,421 --> 00:31:39,891
Are you sure?

591
00:31:39,991 --> 00:31:42,092
Yes, trust me.

592
00:32:01,872 --> 00:32:03,680
Let's start, then.

593
00:32:03,681 --> 00:32:05,241
Darn it, what a bad hand.

594
00:32:05,641 --> 00:32:08,480
Gosh, who's this?

595
00:32:08,481 --> 00:32:11,421
Aren't you the guy from "Make of Desire"?

596
00:32:11,451 --> 00:32:12,582
No, I'm not.

597
00:32:13,622 --> 00:32:17,190
Mother, I came by to say hello.

598
00:32:17,191 --> 00:32:19,731
There's no reason for you to do that.

599
00:32:21,092 --> 00:32:23,231
I was right.

600
00:32:23,431 --> 00:32:24,762
Give us your autograph.

601
00:32:24,862 --> 00:32:26,230
I'm sorry.

602
00:32:26,231 --> 00:32:29,001
I only give out autographs on my autograph-only paper.

603
00:32:29,002 --> 00:32:31,700
Come on.

604
00:32:31,701 --> 00:32:32,872
What's that?

605
00:32:33,772 --> 00:32:35,112
Of course, I'll give out my autograph.

606
00:32:37,641 --> 00:32:39,341
- Autograph! - Autograph!

607
00:32:39,342 --> 00:32:41,282
(Choi Seoung Il, please follow me.)

608
00:32:41,612 --> 00:32:43,181
Thank you.

609
00:32:43,921 --> 00:32:44,950
Take a look at this.

610
00:32:44,951 --> 00:32:47,021
Look how wonderfully he autographs.

611
00:32:47,022 --> 00:32:49,490
He's so good-looking. Go on and get his autograph.

612
00:32:49,491 --> 00:32:52,460
Praying for our children

613
00:32:52,461 --> 00:32:55,762
Day and night

614
00:32:55,862 --> 00:33:02,401
My mother who lived like a crane and an angel

615
00:33:02,802 --> 00:33:09,881
What shall we sacrifice

616
00:33:10,082 --> 00:33:13,111
Besides our tears

617
00:33:13,112 --> 00:33:14,650
Don't fool yourself.

618
00:33:14,651 --> 00:33:15,880
Being like this...

619
00:33:15,881 --> 00:33:18,680
won't relieve my thirty-year-long resentment.

620
00:33:18,681 --> 00:33:19,951
Of course.

621
00:33:20,552 --> 00:33:22,391
I'm sure you were deeply heartbroken.

622
00:33:23,661 --> 00:33:25,522
I'll do my best to make up for it, Mother.

623
00:33:26,391 --> 00:33:29,361
Why did you come only now?

624
00:33:29,362 --> 00:33:31,401
I'm not that kind of person, Mother.

625
00:33:32,332 --> 00:33:34,170
I didn't even know Eun Ran had a baby...

626
00:33:34,171 --> 00:33:35,832
since she cut contact with me.

627
00:33:36,671 --> 00:33:39,002
I would never have looked the other way if I knew about it.

628
00:33:39,572 --> 00:33:40,640
So?

629
00:33:40,641 --> 00:33:43,282
Mother, I don't want anything else.

630
00:33:44,211 --> 00:33:46,282
I only want to play my role as a father.

631
00:33:46,612 --> 00:33:48,881
Something I couldn't do all these years.

632
00:33:49,252 --> 00:33:50,582
Please trust me.

633
00:33:51,082 --> 00:33:54,721
First, I will just watch and see.

634
00:34:01,731 --> 00:34:03,731
Thank you, Mother.

635
00:34:04,862 --> 00:34:07,872
It would have been great if you were around when Woo Ri was a child.

636
00:34:09,171 --> 00:34:10,572
I wondered who's nose...

637
00:34:11,241 --> 00:34:13,942
Woo Ri took after.

638
00:34:14,141 --> 00:34:16,111
She seems to take after you.

639
00:34:18,281 --> 00:34:21,152
Mother, I had a nose-job.

640
00:34:23,221 --> 00:34:24,252
Gosh.

641
00:34:27,591 --> 00:34:29,792
(Dear Kang Jae,)

642
00:34:31,591 --> 00:34:36,431
Let's sleep together.

643
00:34:43,102 --> 00:34:45,501
It won't work for me.

644
00:34:45,502 --> 00:34:48,272
It won't.

645
00:34:54,652 --> 00:34:56,652
A wizard didn't write "Harry Potter".

646
00:34:56,852 --> 00:34:58,180
I'm a writer.

647
00:34:58,181 --> 00:35:00,990
I lack experience, but I can write erotic content.

648
00:35:00,991 --> 00:35:02,122
Let's go.

649
00:35:04,221 --> 00:35:06,221
(It took me so long to decide on this. I can't wait any longer.)

650
00:35:10,661 --> 00:35:12,161
(I wanted to try doing this with you...)

651
00:35:14,672 --> 00:35:16,602
(Lying down on the bed...)

652
00:35:19,372 --> 00:35:21,542
(You make me...)

653
00:35:24,882 --> 00:35:26,882
(I miss you. I love you.)

654
00:35:28,252 --> 00:35:29,582
I'm done.

655
00:35:36,761 --> 00:35:37,962
Hello, sir.

656
00:35:38,192 --> 00:35:41,531
I'm sorry for calling so late.

657
00:35:41,732 --> 00:35:43,462
I just wanted to ask...

658
00:35:43,632 --> 00:35:46,672
how that hospital introduction was coming.

659
00:35:46,801 --> 00:35:49,001
Right, I'm done with that.

660
00:35:49,002 --> 00:35:51,041
I was going to send it to you tomorrow.

661
00:35:51,042 --> 00:35:53,010
I need to send it urgently.

662
00:35:53,011 --> 00:35:55,441
So could you send it to me tonight?

663
00:35:55,442 --> 00:35:56,680
I'll take a look at it first thing in the morning.

664
00:35:56,681 --> 00:35:58,610
Of course, I'll send it over.

665
00:35:58,611 --> 00:36:00,911
- Thank you. - Bye.

666
00:36:02,852 --> 00:36:05,022
(To Kang Jae)

667
00:36:05,181 --> 00:36:07,922
(Send to Raphael)

668
00:36:08,022 --> 00:36:10,062
Did you read what I sent you?

669
00:36:10,922 --> 00:36:13,192
What? What did you send?

670
00:36:14,031 --> 00:36:15,991
I sent you an e-mail.

671
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:19,361
Oh, the e-mail? I read it.

672
00:36:19,672 --> 00:36:22,902
But, I'm not sure about it.

673
00:36:24,641 --> 00:36:27,970
What? What do you mean you're not sure?

674
00:36:27,971 --> 00:36:30,241
It's not something I'm interested in.

675
00:36:30,611 --> 00:36:32,582
- You're not interested? - I'm not.

676
00:36:32,712 --> 00:36:35,082
It's not something I come to experience often.

677
00:36:37,321 --> 00:36:38,981
Do you have a problem or something?

678
00:36:38,982 --> 00:36:41,651
Woo Ri, I would like to help you...

679
00:36:41,652 --> 00:36:43,522
with what you do if I knew everything.

680
00:36:44,161 --> 00:36:46,891
But I can't help it if it's something I don't know.

681
00:36:47,792 --> 00:36:50,732
I mean, I know how good the Diamond Medical Foundation is...

682
00:36:50,931 --> 00:36:53,332
and that they are leaders in K-Beauty.

683
00:36:54,232 --> 00:36:56,402
But it's not something I can give you advice on.

684
00:36:56,641 --> 00:36:58,102
What are you talking about?

685
00:36:58,542 --> 00:37:00,672
You wanted me to take a look at the hospital introduction.

686
00:37:09,652 --> 00:37:11,522
You can't read that e-mail!

687
00:37:12,082 --> 00:37:14,320
Why? What's wrong?

688
00:37:14,321 --> 00:37:16,990
You can't read that e-mail.

689
00:37:16,991 --> 00:37:19,391
That e-mail has a virus...

690
00:37:20,591 --> 00:37:24,101
No, it's spam.

691
00:37:24,102 --> 00:37:26,232
It's a scam.

692
00:37:27,132 --> 00:37:30,201
It wasn't anything like that. There was a letter, though.

693
00:37:32,672 --> 00:37:33,971
(Oh Woo Ri)

694
00:37:34,042 --> 00:37:35,042
(Hello Kang Jae)

695
00:37:35,772 --> 00:37:36,982
Did you read it?

696
00:37:37,312 --> 00:37:39,882
I didn't know you wanted to get that close to me.

697
00:37:43,382 --> 00:37:44,882
That wasn't for me, was it?

698
00:37:46,082 --> 00:37:48,551
Since you are a writer...

699
00:37:49,422 --> 00:37:50,821
It was so eloquently written.

700
00:37:51,861 --> 00:37:53,530
While reading it, I was just...

701
00:37:53,531 --> 00:37:55,562
By the way,

702
00:37:56,531 --> 00:37:58,501
I sent the introduction letter, again.

703
00:37:58,502 --> 00:37:59,530
Please check.

704
00:37:59,531 --> 00:38:01,332
Yes, I read it.

705
00:38:01,531 --> 00:38:04,041
Since your writing was outstanding,

706
00:38:04,042 --> 00:38:05,801
I unconsciously clapped my hands while reading it.

707
00:38:06,712 --> 00:38:08,971
It was really good. Good job.

708
00:38:12,042 --> 00:38:13,151
Thank you.

709
00:38:13,152 --> 00:38:15,311
Then, I'll get back to my writing.

710
00:38:15,312 --> 00:38:17,681
- Goodbye. - Have a nice day.

711
00:38:34,332 --> 00:38:35,502
What is all this?

712
00:38:35,701 --> 00:38:37,300
Why are you here all the time?

713
00:38:37,301 --> 00:38:38,941
I brought some flowers.

714
00:38:38,942 --> 00:38:39,942
I don't need them.

715
00:38:40,141 --> 00:38:41,840
Let's keep some distance

716
00:38:41,841 --> 00:38:44,280
- These aren't for you. - What?

717
00:38:44,281 --> 00:38:46,610
Seoung Il, you came.

718
00:38:46,611 --> 00:38:49,280
Yes, Mother. I brought some flowers.

719
00:38:49,281 --> 00:38:52,151
And I brought all the Choi Seoung Il souvenirs.

720
00:38:52,152 --> 00:38:54,550
- You should take them. - Gosh, you shouldn't have.

721
00:38:54,551 --> 00:38:56,391
I'll put them to good use.

722
00:38:56,591 --> 00:38:58,991
I made some braised ribs since you told me you are coming.

723
00:39:00,491 --> 00:39:03,601
Mom, what is this between you two? What are you doing?

724
00:39:03,602 --> 00:39:06,101
He could stay when Woo Ri's not around.

725
00:39:06,102 --> 00:39:08,471
I'm such a fan.

726
00:39:08,832 --> 00:39:10,071
Mom, seriously...

727
00:39:12,442 --> 00:39:14,872
- Are you wearing perfume? - It's the soap.

728
00:39:15,011 --> 00:39:17,141
I told him to come and eat.

729
00:39:17,882 --> 00:39:19,140
Do you contact each other privately?

730
00:39:19,141 --> 00:39:21,351
Eun Ran, take care of the restaurant for a bit.

731
00:39:21,352 --> 00:39:23,721
I'm going to the welfare center with Seoung Il.

732
00:39:23,982 --> 00:39:26,252
Can you sign a couple of autographs?

733
00:39:26,482 --> 00:39:27,522
Mom.

734
00:39:29,122 --> 00:39:30,861
- Kang Jae. - Yes?

735
00:39:31,962 --> 00:39:36,431
Do you remember me telling you about "Home Alone" before?

736
00:39:37,161 --> 00:39:38,401
Right,

737
00:39:38,402 --> 00:39:41,602
about not being able to wear skates after cherishing them for too long?

738
00:39:41,931 --> 00:39:42,971
Yes.

739
00:39:44,442 --> 00:39:48,071
I think we are like that.

740
00:39:55,781 --> 00:39:59,382
After all our plans changed,

741
00:39:59,781 --> 00:40:00,821
I think I know now.

742
00:40:02,152 --> 00:40:06,091
These moments that we share are even more precious to me now.

743
00:40:09,062 --> 00:40:11,232
- Kang Jae. - Yes?

744
00:40:13,372 --> 00:40:14,502
I love you.

745
00:40:22,111 --> 00:40:23,882
I love you too, Woo Ri.

746
00:40:26,582 --> 00:40:27,712
Let's...

747
00:40:31,922 --> 00:40:33,292
sleep together.

748
00:40:51,241 --> 00:40:52,341
Tomorrow,

749
00:40:53,312 --> 00:40:56,741
let's have dinner at the Chinese restaurant in Myeong-dong.

750
00:40:57,681 --> 00:40:58,781
What?

751
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:01,781
The one I wanted to check out?

752
00:41:02,611 --> 00:41:03,852
The restaurant at the hotel?

753
00:41:04,781 --> 00:41:06,382
Yes. We'll have dinner there...

754
00:41:06,922 --> 00:41:08,491
and breakfast at the hotel.

755
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:14,391
Okay.

756
00:41:22,632 --> 00:41:23,800
All right.

757
00:41:23,801 --> 00:41:25,442
Here you go.

758
00:41:27,611 --> 00:41:28,672
Seoung Il?

759
00:41:29,982 --> 00:41:31,781
I need to do something about this.

760
00:41:32,582 --> 00:41:33,812
I really want to see her.

761
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:37,821
I have to see her today.

762
00:41:38,022 --> 00:41:39,221
Who?

763
00:41:39,821 --> 00:41:41,090
Mr. Kim.

764
00:41:41,091 --> 00:41:42,591
- Take me to the writer's office. - What?

765
00:41:43,252 --> 00:41:44,591
You want to see the writer?

766
00:41:44,922 --> 00:41:46,192
Ms. Oh!

767
00:41:47,861 --> 00:41:49,192
Mr. Choi.

768
00:41:53,931 --> 00:41:55,102
Here.

769
00:41:55,971 --> 00:41:57,442
I brought you some snacks.

770
00:41:57,902 --> 00:41:59,442
Thank you.

771
00:42:00,272 --> 00:42:02,111
Ms. Yu is upstairs. Let's go.

772
00:42:02,272 --> 00:42:03,542
Oh, that's okay.

773
00:42:05,011 --> 00:42:07,252
Can we talk? Just the two of us.

774
00:42:08,051 --> 00:42:09,181
Sorry?

775
00:42:11,181 --> 00:42:13,280
- Why don't we... - How about the indoor playground?

776
00:42:13,281 --> 00:42:15,752
Yes. Let's go there. It'll be so much fun, right?

777
00:42:15,922 --> 00:42:17,761
- Yes. - Let's go.

778
00:42:21,491 --> 00:42:22,692
Seoung Il.

779
00:42:23,402 --> 00:42:25,861
No, don't do it. The age gap is just too big.

780
00:42:26,832 --> 00:42:28,102
- Mr. Kim? - My gosh!

781
00:42:28,602 --> 00:42:29,832
- Ms. Yu. - What are you doing here?

782
00:42:30,442 --> 00:42:32,102
What? Woo Ri and Seoung Il?

783
00:42:32,272 --> 00:42:33,610
- What are they doing? - Come on.

784
00:42:33,611 --> 00:42:34,672
Ms. Yu.

785
00:42:34,872 --> 00:42:37,382
Just pretend you never saw this. I'll get it all sorted out.

786
00:42:37,911 --> 00:42:39,081
What are you talking about?

787
00:42:39,082 --> 00:42:40,181
I think...

788
00:42:41,011 --> 00:42:42,511
Seoung Il likes your assistant.

789
00:42:43,982 --> 00:42:45,082
What?

790
00:42:50,422 --> 00:42:52,991
Was there something you wanted to talk to me about?

791
00:42:55,332 --> 00:42:56,661
No, I just...

792
00:42:57,761 --> 00:42:59,031
I was just in the area.

793
00:43:00,632 --> 00:43:01,832
I see.

794
00:43:02,872 --> 00:43:04,071
Well...

795
00:43:05,442 --> 00:43:06,641
Your father.

796
00:43:07,341 --> 00:43:08,712
I heard he passed away.

797
00:43:12,681 --> 00:43:13,882
It's a banned word in my family.

798
00:43:14,212 --> 00:43:15,411
The word, "dad".

799
00:43:15,652 --> 00:43:16,781
What?

800
00:43:17,852 --> 00:43:19,821
I heard he died before I was even born.

801
00:43:20,821 --> 00:43:22,721
He passed away when my mom was pregnant with me.

802
00:43:23,692 --> 00:43:26,192
So I never pressed her for details.

803
00:43:27,761 --> 00:43:29,531
It must've been so devastating.

804
00:43:30,632 --> 00:43:33,701
It must've been so hard for my mom.

805
00:43:38,341 --> 00:43:39,640
Actually,

806
00:43:39,641 --> 00:43:43,542
I remember asking her about Dad when I was little.

807
00:43:44,341 --> 00:43:45,681
But when I was in middle school,

808
00:43:47,611 --> 00:43:48,911
I realized...

809
00:43:50,582 --> 00:43:53,181
that hearing me say the word, "dad",

810
00:43:54,122 --> 00:43:55,292
always made my mom cry.

811
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:01,462
That's why, in my family,

812
00:44:02,261 --> 00:44:04,102
that word simply doesn't exist.

813
00:44:04,431 --> 00:44:05,602
The word, "dad".

814
00:44:11,201 --> 00:44:13,172
What was my mom like when she was young?

815
00:44:18,082 --> 00:44:19,241
She was pretty.

816
00:44:21,482 --> 00:44:23,011
Very pretty.

817
00:44:29,451 --> 00:44:30,720
Mr. Choi?

818
00:44:30,721 --> 00:44:31,792
Yes.

819
00:44:33,221 --> 00:44:34,361
Let's go.

820
00:44:37,562 --> 00:44:39,402
I'm meeting someone. Let's go.

821
00:44:41,002 --> 00:44:42,632
Enjoy the snacks!

822
00:44:51,582 --> 00:44:54,152
- Just for one night? - Yes.

823
00:44:55,281 --> 00:44:58,852
Why are you so excited to pull an all-nighter at the office?

824
00:45:00,221 --> 00:45:02,351
No, I'm not excited.

825
00:45:02,352 --> 00:45:03,490
It's okay.

826
00:45:03,491 --> 00:45:06,160
Whatever you do, just enjoy it.

827
00:45:06,161 --> 00:45:07,562
- And have fun while at it. - Okay.

828
00:45:08,431 --> 00:45:10,201
- Bye. - Bye.

829
00:45:18,772 --> 00:45:20,312
- Bye. - What? What's this about?

830
00:45:22,741 --> 00:45:24,840
Booked under Mr. Lee Kang Jae, right?

831
00:45:24,841 --> 00:45:26,312
It's Room 2301.

832
00:45:35,551 --> 00:45:37,161
- Have some. - Okay.

833
00:45:37,422 --> 00:45:39,192
You should eat too.

834
00:45:39,622 --> 00:45:40,692
Okay.

835
00:45:59,241 --> 00:46:00,352
What's taking her so long?

836
00:46:05,422 --> 00:46:08,450
Eeny, meeny, miny, Moe

837
00:46:08,451 --> 00:46:11,321
Catch a tiger by the toe

838
00:46:15,591 --> 00:46:16,692
Woo Ri.

839
00:46:17,261 --> 00:46:19,132
Yes? What is it?

840
00:46:19,261 --> 00:46:22,201
Hey, you've been in there for an hour.

841
00:46:22,872 --> 00:46:24,172
Is everything okay?

842
00:46:24,641 --> 00:46:26,241
Yes, I'll be out in a minute.

843
00:46:27,042 --> 00:46:28,172
Okay.

844
00:46:35,281 --> 00:46:36,382
Did you shower?

845
00:46:41,551 --> 00:46:43,390
Hey, are you all right?

846
00:46:43,391 --> 00:46:45,261
Yes, I'm fine.

847
00:47:08,551 --> 00:47:09,652
Whose phone is it?

848
00:47:09,951 --> 00:47:11,852
- Mine. It's my phone. - Okay.

849
00:47:14,522 --> 00:47:15,922
Hello, sir.

850
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:18,792
The hospital introduction?

851
00:47:19,721 --> 00:47:22,031
I see. It got good feedback in China?

852
00:47:23,462 --> 00:47:26,632
I'm sorry, but I'm busy at the moment.

853
00:47:27,431 --> 00:47:29,672
Yes, okay.

854
00:47:33,872 --> 00:47:35,071
Was that Raphael?

855
00:47:35,611 --> 00:47:36,872
Yes.

856
00:47:38,312 --> 00:47:40,652
It was about the hospital introduction I wrote for them.

857
00:48:03,741 --> 00:48:04,942
Whose phone is it?

858
00:48:05,272 --> 00:48:06,471
I think it's mine this time.

859
00:48:09,212 --> 00:48:11,241
Hello, Raphael. What's up?

860
00:48:12,942 --> 00:48:14,082
Right.

861
00:48:14,911 --> 00:48:18,082
Oh, that. I'll have the investigator in charge call you.

862
00:48:19,082 --> 00:48:21,522
Yes. I'm busy at the moment.

863
00:48:21,951 --> 00:48:23,051
All right.

864
00:48:26,422 --> 00:48:27,632
Was that Raphael?

865
00:48:28,161 --> 00:48:30,292
Yes, it was about the investigation.

866
00:48:55,951 --> 00:48:57,051
What's this sound?

867
00:48:57,361 --> 00:48:58,422
What's going on?

868
00:48:59,062 --> 00:49:00,491
We apologize.

869
00:49:01,361 --> 00:49:03,761
It's a false fire alarm.

870
00:49:05,201 --> 00:49:08,031
- What? It gave me such a scare. - You can go back inside.

871
00:49:08,232 --> 00:49:09,372
Let's go inside.

872
00:49:10,902 --> 00:49:12,241
Sorry, our apologies.

873
00:49:14,611 --> 00:49:15,872
- Kang Jae? - Yes?

874
00:49:16,372 --> 00:49:17,641
What are you thinking?

875
00:49:18,641 --> 00:49:19,681
Well...

876
00:49:20,951 --> 00:49:23,252
I think someone is...

877
00:49:23,852 --> 00:49:25,152
giving me a sign.

878
00:49:25,382 --> 00:49:26,951
A sign? Like what?

879
00:49:27,252 --> 00:49:28,292
Well...

880
00:49:30,152 --> 00:49:31,221
Woo Ri.

881
00:49:31,591 --> 00:49:32,991
Let's just go home.

882
00:49:34,091 --> 00:49:36,062
- Why? - Let's just go home tonight.

883
00:49:37,761 --> 00:49:39,561
We'll spend time together then, not tonight.

884
00:49:39,562 --> 00:49:40,632
I think that'll be better.

885
00:49:43,132 --> 00:49:44,341
When?

886
00:49:44,442 --> 00:49:45,571
What?

887
00:49:45,942 --> 00:49:47,002
Hey.

888
00:49:47,542 --> 00:49:49,071
You said you were working all night.

889
00:49:50,641 --> 00:49:53,281
The plan got cancelled, so I got to leave early.

890
00:49:53,511 --> 00:49:55,882
- Did you have dinner? - Yes.

891
00:49:58,152 --> 00:49:59,752
- Mom. - Yes?

892
00:50:00,252 --> 00:50:02,951
- Grandma. - Yes? What is it?

893
00:50:05,861 --> 00:50:07,732
I'm getting married.

894
00:50:08,192 --> 00:50:10,502
- What? Really? - Really?

895
00:50:11,301 --> 00:50:12,402
Yes.

896
00:50:20,402 --> 00:50:24,341
Kang Jae wants to get married after the baby is born.

897
00:50:31,152 --> 00:50:34,821
We're deviating a little from the plan we had for our future,

898
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:37,721
but we'll always be together, you know?

899
00:50:39,692 --> 00:50:41,431
So let's be patient.

900
00:50:42,991 --> 00:50:44,062
Okay?

901
00:50:47,632 --> 00:50:50,132
- Okay. - Good.

902
00:50:53,442 --> 00:50:55,570
- That's amazing! - I'm so happy for you!

903
00:50:55,571 --> 00:50:57,211
- Congratulations! - My gosh.

904
00:50:57,212 --> 00:50:59,081
I've been waiting for this news.

905
00:50:59,082 --> 00:51:01,251
- Show us your ring. - Let's see.

906
00:51:01,252 --> 00:51:03,581
- Oh, my. - She has such nice hands.

907
00:51:03,582 --> 00:51:05,550
I'll pull the all-nighter then.

908
00:51:05,551 --> 00:51:07,590
My gosh! Isn't it so beautiful, Mom?

909
00:51:07,591 --> 00:51:09,221
- Yes, it is. - Let's see.

910
00:51:15,132 --> 00:51:16,361
- Hello. - Hello.

911
00:51:16,431 --> 00:51:18,860
- Is it done? - Yes, almost.

912
00:51:18,861 --> 00:51:19,902
Okay.

913
00:51:27,272 --> 00:51:28,911
Shin Mi Young, age 35.

914
00:51:29,071 --> 00:51:31,341
A nurse in Diamond's plastic surgery clinic.

915
00:51:31,582 --> 00:51:33,481
She was off that day, so she wasn't one of our suspects.

916
00:51:33,482 --> 00:51:36,352
Don't tell me you think she's Chairman Kim.

917
00:51:36,451 --> 00:51:39,550
The time lines don't match up at all.

918
00:51:39,551 --> 00:51:42,490
Captain, it's possible that Chairman Kim ordered Shin to...

919
00:51:42,491 --> 00:51:44,390
Kang Jae. Find out if Shin Mi Young...

920
00:51:44,391 --> 00:51:46,661
was holding a grudge against No Man Chul, okay?

921
00:51:47,962 --> 00:51:50,031
Okay, got it.

922
00:51:53,332 --> 00:51:54,471
That'd be all.

923
00:51:58,002 --> 00:51:59,641
Great! That is impressive.

924
00:52:00,301 --> 00:52:02,442
Now, if that came true, I'd have nothing more to wish for.

925
00:52:05,082 --> 00:52:07,180
- I have a question. - Sure, ask away.

926
00:52:07,181 --> 00:52:09,510
Did you go to China and have an in-person meeting...

927
00:52:09,511 --> 00:52:10,951
with Liang Li Mao Mei Plastic Surgery?

928
00:52:11,522 --> 00:52:13,950
Not yet. But I've already negotiated the details...

929
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:15,320
with the headman who's in Korea.

930
00:52:15,321 --> 00:52:17,491
The head of the company?

931
00:52:18,422 --> 00:52:19,422
You mean, this man?

932
00:52:21,861 --> 00:52:23,031
What?

933
00:52:23,292 --> 00:52:25,530
The one who ran tabs at bars with a business card that said...

934
00:52:25,531 --> 00:52:28,132
he was a Chinese businessman and got sued?

935
00:52:28,301 --> 00:52:29,301
What?

936
00:52:29,302 --> 00:52:32,371
He had nothing to do with Liang Li Mao Mei Plastic Surgery.

937
00:52:32,372 --> 00:52:35,471
What's that word? Right, he's a swindler.

938
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:38,541
- No, let me explain. - Oh, boy.

939
00:52:38,542 --> 00:52:41,680
I was wondering how you landed such a huge deal so easily. Forget it.

940
00:52:41,681 --> 00:52:45,082
- Sir. - The video call just got connected.

941
00:52:45,181 --> 00:52:46,551
Sir, say hello.

942
00:52:46,781 --> 00:52:50,051
Mr. Li Won Ming, the CEO of Liang Li Mao Mei Plastic Surgery.

943
00:52:54,062 --> 00:52:55,590
Hello.

944
00:52:55,591 --> 00:52:58,632
I read the business proposal from Diamond.

945
00:52:58,701 --> 00:53:02,331
I have tried Diamond's cosmetic products myself,

946
00:53:02,332 --> 00:53:03,832
and they were amazing.

947
00:53:04,102 --> 00:53:07,271
We would like to order all cosmetics and skincare products...

948
00:53:07,272 --> 00:53:10,911
from Diamond to use them at Liang Li Mao Mei Hospital.

949
00:53:10,982 --> 00:53:12,011
What did he say?

950
00:53:12,281 --> 00:53:14,082
They want to use our cosmetics.

951
00:53:15,551 --> 00:53:18,180
The hospital introduction Raphael sent to me...

952
00:53:18,181 --> 00:53:20,221
was surprisingly entertaining.

953
00:53:20,451 --> 00:53:22,691
I look forward to meeting the man...

954
00:53:22,692 --> 00:53:25,220
who works with such enthusiasm.

955
00:53:25,221 --> 00:53:29,061
Thank you, Mr. Li. I'll schedule a time as soon as possible.

956
00:53:29,062 --> 00:53:32,561
I look forward to hearing from you. Thank you.

957
00:53:32,562 --> 00:53:33,602
Thank you.

958
00:53:34,571 --> 00:53:35,800
Look at you, Raphael.

959
00:53:35,801 --> 00:53:38,002
I see that your English has improved.

960
00:53:38,341 --> 00:53:39,871
It wasn't so good when you returned from overseas.

961
00:53:39,872 --> 00:53:41,111
Come on.

962
00:53:42,042 --> 00:53:43,471
So? Will you just pack up and leave?

963
00:53:44,011 --> 00:53:45,382
Want the executive director position?

964
00:53:45,982 --> 00:53:49,082
Executive Director Jeon Byeon Jin.

965
00:53:50,551 --> 00:53:51,852
It's hard to pronounce.

966
00:53:53,252 --> 00:53:57,462
A peck of pickled peppers. Jeon Byeon Jin. Jeon...

967
00:53:59,221 --> 00:54:01,991
It's such a tongue twister. Just get out.

968
00:54:04,562 --> 00:54:05,632
Fire him.

969
00:54:06,332 --> 00:54:07,571
That's it for the meeting.

970
00:54:11,571 --> 00:54:13,201
Ma Ri! Hey, Ma Ri.

971
00:54:13,442 --> 00:54:15,812
What happened? Did you tell him?

972
00:54:16,111 --> 00:54:18,081
I'm a member of the Diamond family.

973
00:54:18,082 --> 00:54:19,941
Of course, I should look out for them.

974
00:54:19,942 --> 00:54:23,011
But you said you and Raphael weren't on good terms.

975
00:54:23,212 --> 00:54:27,181
All married couples fight and make up.

976
00:54:27,352 --> 00:54:30,451
Well, pack up your things and be on your way.

977
00:54:31,221 --> 00:54:33,292
- Ma Ri. - Let go! People are watching.

978
00:54:34,132 --> 00:54:35,332
Ma Ri.

979
00:54:36,491 --> 00:54:38,632
- Thanks. - No problem at all.

980
00:54:38,861 --> 00:54:40,430
I work for the hospital too, you know.

981
00:54:40,431 --> 00:54:41,672
Still.

982
00:54:42,031 --> 00:54:44,872
Had we not looked into it, the damage would've been huge.

983
00:54:45,672 --> 00:54:48,611
I heard he never told anyone. How did you find out?

984
00:54:49,542 --> 00:54:50,712
Just somehow.

985
00:54:52,141 --> 00:54:54,611
Anyway, I'm so glad it's all been sorted out now.

986
00:54:55,082 --> 00:54:58,051
I'm happy because things seem to be going well for us.

987
00:54:59,022 --> 00:55:00,622
You know, with the baby too.

988
00:55:01,891 --> 00:55:02,891
Right?

989
00:55:02,892 --> 00:55:04,261
- Ma Ri. - Yes?

990
00:55:05,661 --> 00:55:06,792
Here.

991
00:55:10,031 --> 00:55:11,102
(Seoul Family Court)

992
00:55:11,632 --> 00:55:13,661
- What's this? - Let's get a divorce.

993
00:55:14,502 --> 00:55:17,232
What? You're at it again? Why?

994
00:55:29,352 --> 00:55:31,821
I found out that you were meeting Jeon Byeon Jin, so I looked into it.

995
00:55:32,821 --> 00:55:34,752
I must say, I was surprised to see this.

996
00:55:35,091 --> 00:55:37,591
- When did you find out? - Is that important?

997
00:55:38,221 --> 00:55:40,161
If you knew, why didn't you tell me?

998
00:55:40,891 --> 00:55:42,031
Because of the baby.

999
00:55:43,292 --> 00:55:46,332
I thought long and hard to figure out what would be best for the baby.

1000
00:55:47,161 --> 00:55:48,402
But this is just wrong.

1001
00:55:49,071 --> 00:55:51,801
It's over. We're really through now.

1002
00:55:52,172 --> 00:55:53,641
But what if she doesn't give you the baby?

1003
00:55:54,102 --> 00:55:56,240
What if she refuses to give you the baby because we're divorced?

1004
00:55:56,241 --> 00:55:58,911
I was a fool for letting you use the baby to sway me.

1005
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:01,752
I will protect...

1006
00:56:02,812 --> 00:56:04,181
my gummy bear.

1007
00:56:07,622 --> 00:56:09,051
I can totally do it alone.

1008
00:56:14,232 --> 00:56:15,531
It's so cute.

1009
00:56:21,372 --> 00:56:22,530
Hey, Duk Chil.

1010
00:56:22,531 --> 00:56:25,201
Hey. Someone's in a good mood for a change.

1011
00:56:25,442 --> 00:56:28,372
You see, Woo Ri... My daughter is getting married.

1012
00:56:28,471 --> 00:56:29,672
What? She's getting married?

1013
00:56:30,241 --> 00:56:32,280
- Really? When? - After the baby is born.

1014
00:56:32,281 --> 00:56:33,780
Is she pregnant now?

1015
00:56:33,781 --> 00:56:35,382
Really? When did that happen?

1016
00:56:35,582 --> 00:56:37,951
Well, it's...

1017
00:56:38,122 --> 00:56:40,221
It's a long story.

1018
00:56:40,321 --> 00:56:41,621
That's all you need to know.

1019
00:56:41,622 --> 00:56:42,721
What? Why...

1020
00:56:43,292 --> 00:56:46,220
Why won't you tell me anything?

1021
00:56:46,221 --> 00:56:49,660
Hold on. Then I should walk her down the aisle.

1022
00:56:49,661 --> 00:56:51,401
I'll hold her hand and walk her down the aisle.

1023
00:56:51,402 --> 00:56:52,800
You? Why?

1024
00:56:52,801 --> 00:56:54,271
I'm her father. That's why.

1025
00:56:54,272 --> 00:56:55,930
Gosh, whatever.

1026
00:56:55,931 --> 00:56:57,602
Let's talk about it another time. It's complicated.

1027
00:56:58,102 --> 00:57:00,602
You see, her pregnancy was totally unexpected.

1028
00:57:01,372 --> 00:57:04,042
That's all you need to know for now. I'll explain later.

1029
00:57:04,172 --> 00:57:06,740
- I'm getting a headache. Bye. - Wait, Eun Ran.

1030
00:57:06,741 --> 00:57:08,982
What? Hey. Eun Ran!

1031
00:57:09,582 --> 00:57:10,712
Goodness.

1032
00:57:11,882 --> 00:57:15,090
All right. I'll take you home, Seoung Il.

1033
00:57:15,091 --> 00:57:16,221
Take me to Bukgajwa-dong.

1034
00:57:17,761 --> 00:57:18,821
What?

1035
00:57:19,721 --> 00:57:21,161
Seo Gwi Nyeo's Pork Cutlet. Let's go.

1036
00:57:31,201 --> 00:57:32,301
I'm...

1037
00:57:34,102 --> 00:57:35,571
getting a divorce.

1038
00:57:37,011 --> 00:57:40,241
Sorry? Divorce? Why?

1039
00:57:40,681 --> 00:57:44,382
It's personal, so I can't tell you everything.

1040
00:57:45,982 --> 00:57:49,792
I know that you want to find the perfect home for the baby,

1041
00:57:50,692 --> 00:57:53,221
so I came here to tell you this in person.

1042
00:57:53,821 --> 00:57:55,192
Although I'm getting a divorce,

1043
00:57:55,661 --> 00:57:57,732
I'll make sure to create the perfect environment for the baby.

1044
00:57:58,502 --> 00:58:00,761
So please put your trust in me,

1045
00:58:02,102 --> 00:58:04,272
and I truly hope that you won't change your mind.

1046
00:58:05,841 --> 00:58:08,741
I'm sorry for causing you concern.

1047
00:58:20,721 --> 00:58:21,951
Woo Ri.

1048
00:58:25,062 --> 00:58:27,462
- Woo Ri! - Is he out of his mind?

1049
00:58:27,522 --> 00:58:29,462
- Hey. - Woo Ri.

1050
00:58:29,861 --> 00:58:31,732
- Hey, no. - Woo Ri.

1051
00:58:31,962 --> 00:58:34,132
I'm your father.

1052
00:58:36,571 --> 00:58:38,301
Woo Ri, I am your father.

1053
00:58:39,701 --> 00:58:40,772
Dad?

1054
00:59:16,042 --> 00:59:18,681
(Woori the Virgin)

1055
00:59:19,082 --> 00:59:21,611
How am I going to face you from now on?

1056
00:59:21,712 --> 00:59:22,751
Someone reported...

1057
00:59:22,752 --> 00:59:24,251
- domestic violence. - What?

1058
00:59:24,252 --> 00:59:26,321
I don't want to get a divorce.

1059
00:59:26,482 --> 00:59:28,191
Then Raphael is...

1060
00:59:28,192 --> 00:59:30,292
I don't think you should keep the baby.

1061
00:59:30,422 --> 00:59:33,522
You call, telling the whole country I'm pregnant, help?

1062
00:59:33,562 --> 00:59:36,661
Let's just go back to being strangers.

1063
00:59:36,732 --> 00:59:38,530
Of course, we should.

1064
00:59:38,531 --> 00:59:40,260
You investigating the hospital.

1065
00:59:40,261 --> 00:59:42,631
Are you trying to get back at me for getting her pregnant?

1066
00:59:42,632 --> 00:59:44,700
As long as we remain sincere,

1067
00:59:44,701 --> 00:59:46,971
we can take it slow and get close.

1068
00:59:47,672 --> 00:59:50,272
I feel like there's no one else in the world but just the two of us.

1069
00:59:54,812 --> 00:59:58,821
