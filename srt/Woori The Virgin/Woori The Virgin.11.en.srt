(Woori the Virgin)

9
00:00:34,339 --> 00:00:36,040
You can't be with this man!

10
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,679
Hey, let this hand go and we'll talk it out.

11
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:46,279
What's with you all of a sudden?

12
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:49,980
Kang Jae, why are you being like this?

13
00:00:50,779 --> 00:00:51,850
Woo Ri.

14
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:54,620
Let's talk outside.

15
00:00:56,289 --> 00:00:57,319
No, don't.

16
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:02,829
I'll be back in a moment.

17
00:01:04,899 --> 00:01:05,929
Let's go.

18
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,699
I think Kim Bok Rae is a criminal. You're in danger.

19
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,808
What are you talking about? Explain so I can understand.

20
00:01:11,809 --> 00:01:13,639
I heard someone at Diamond was Chairman Kim,

21
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,839
so I've been investigating.

22
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,979
I think Kim Bok Rae is Chairman Kim.

23
00:01:20,149 --> 00:01:21,919
- Do you have evidence? - Yes.

24
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,319
Well, the thing is...

25
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:30,259
I had evidence, but it's gone now.

26
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,390
What?

27
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:35,600
Kang Jae.

28
00:01:37,059 --> 00:01:39,069
How did you find me here?

29
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:41,069
I didn't tell anyone I was here.

30
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,539
Did you track my location by any chance?

31
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,739
A murder took place at the hospital,

32
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:52,209
so I understand that the police could suspect him.

33
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:56,720
But you shouldn't let your feelings interfere in your investigation.

34
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:00,319
I hope stuff like this doesn't happen again.

35
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,390
I'm going back inside.

36
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,169
Darn it.

37
00:02:13,329 --> 00:02:16,799
I apologize on Kang Jae's behalf.

38
00:02:17,609 --> 00:02:18,810
Why would you apologize?

39
00:02:20,009 --> 00:02:22,309
But why did he have to barge in at such an important moment?

40
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:25,380
I mean, I was in the middle of singing the song...

41
00:02:26,609 --> 00:02:29,449
Well, maybe that's a good thing.

42
00:02:29,579 --> 00:02:32,549
I was cringing so badly that I wanted to disappear...

43
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,959
- Why would I be mad? It's nothing. - You're not upset, right?

44
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,060
Of course, I'm not upset. I was just kidding.

45
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:41,430
Go on in.

46
00:02:42,699 --> 00:02:45,500
I shall go in, then.

47
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,000
Thank you.

48
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,910
I know you're there. Come out.

49
00:02:58,049 --> 00:03:00,949
(Seo Gwi Nyeo's Pork Cutlet)

50
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,789
What? Did you think I wouldn't know?

51
00:03:08,919 --> 00:03:10,359
Let me just say one thing.

52
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,789
You'd better listen carefully.

53
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,400
If anything bad happens to Woo Ri,

54
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:17,870
I will...

55
00:03:18,729 --> 00:03:22,440
follow you to the end of the world and chew you to pieces.

56
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:26,739
Why are you saying Won Bin's line from "The Man From Nowhere"?

57
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,479
And why are you dropping the honorifics?

58
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:31,310
Let me ask you something.

59
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,749
Did you peg me as the prime suspect...

60
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,489
based on your objective judgment as a police detective?

61
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:42,019
Or are you...

62
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,989
reacting emotionally as Woo Ri's ex-boyfriend?

63
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,069
If you...

64
00:03:53,269 --> 00:03:55,169
react emotionally and accuse me one more time,

65
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:57,470
I won't sit back quietly.

66
00:04:02,509 --> 00:04:04,009
You won't sit back quietly?

67
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,590
I'm watching you.

68
00:04:27,629 --> 00:04:29,999
Yes, sir. I'll be off, then.

69
00:04:35,179 --> 00:04:38,049
You've been suspended for a week. Get some rest.

70
00:04:38,249 --> 00:04:39,679
I'll keep on investigating.

71
00:04:39,809 --> 00:04:43,280
Did I not warn you that this would happen if you messed with Diamond?

72
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,288
I said the higher-ups were vying for a chance...

73
00:04:45,289 --> 00:04:47,618
to teach you a lesson because of the chairman of Diamond.

74
00:04:47,619 --> 00:04:50,189
"Detectives look at nothing but evidence."

75
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,558
You taught me that.

76
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:55,260
You made a move when you didn't have sufficient evidence!

77
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:57,428
I swear, when I first opened Raphael's safe,

78
00:04:57,429 --> 00:04:59,629
I saw No Man Chul's necklace.

79
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,899
Chairman Kim is right in front of us.

80
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,069
He broke into Woo Ri's home, for goodness' sake! We must get him.

81
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,010
Okay, we will catch him.

82
00:05:06,239 --> 00:05:09,079
But it's just for a week. Rest up and cool off.

83
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,349
Taking a break helps you see things that you couldn't see before.

84
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:13,178
Then you can regain your balance.

85
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:14,649
Nothing will happen.

86
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:16,379
No one will die.

87
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,219
How do you know?

88
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,419
Are you the only one with intuition? I have it too, you see.

89
00:05:22,059 --> 00:05:25,359
Chairman Kim can't make a move knowing we're closing in on him.

90
00:05:25,489 --> 00:05:27,660
I don't care. I can't just stay home and rest.

91
00:05:28,059 --> 00:05:29,829
I'll keep on investigating on my own.

92
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,169
You deserve another beating. You fool!

93
00:05:32,429 --> 00:05:34,999
Hey, you can't investigate anything during a suspension.

94
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:38,070
You're not a cop during your one-week suspension. Do nothing!

95
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:40,309
(Police That Uphold Integrity and Transparency)

96
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,850
You have a new message.

97
00:05:45,609 --> 00:05:47,079
(Lee Kang Jae has been suspended.)

98
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,918
(He'll be quiet for the time being,)

99
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:50,619
(so wrap it up quickly. I can't help you much longer.)

100
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:58,590
(Yes. You must listen to me if you want to be done with it soon.)

101
00:05:59,289 --> 00:06:00,729
(Message sent)

102
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:11,169
(Seo Gwi Nyeo's Pork Cutlet)

103
00:06:14,809 --> 00:06:17,979
He took the necklace.

104
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:23,650
Darn it!

105
00:06:31,929 --> 00:06:32,989
Yes.

106
00:06:34,559 --> 00:06:36,160
I saw it with my own two eyes.

107
00:06:37,229 --> 00:06:38,600
I can't just sit back and do nothing.

108
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:44,710
Sir, it's been finalized as you had suggested.

109
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:46,840
- Here, let me sign off on it. - Sure.

110
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,059
Yes.

111
00:07:04,559 --> 00:07:05,590
What?

112
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,460
(Seo Gwi Nyeo's Pork Cutlet)

113
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,109
(Seo Gwi Nyeo's Pork Cutlet)

114
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,809
You can't investigate anything during a suspension.

115
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:58,650
You're not a cop during your one-week suspension. Do nothing!

116
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,220
Oh, my! How could it taste so good?

117
00:08:10,859 --> 00:08:12,330
It's so good that I'm getting goosebumps.

118
00:08:12,429 --> 00:08:14,229
I'm a huge fan of yours, Chef Seo Gwi Nyeo.

119
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,659
- So you're a fan of MSG. - Pardon me?

120
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,970
Be quiet, will you?

121
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,270
Raphael. How could you get here so quickly?

122
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:27,369
Oh, I happened to be in the area to take care of something.

123
00:08:28,679 --> 00:08:32,309
If you're ever in the area, feel free to come by for some food.

124
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:35,618
My gosh. It's been so long since I last had a home-cooked meal.

125
00:08:35,619 --> 00:08:37,349
I'd actually eat here every day if I could.

126
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,989
You can come by every day.

127
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:40,920
Actually,

128
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:42,658
it's getting late. Why don't you sleep here...

129
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:44,420
and have breakfast with us in the morning?

130
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,460
Mom, please.

131
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:50,330
I'd love to, but that's...

132
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,329
The thing is, my pipes burst yesterday,

133
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:55,700
so I have to stay at a hotel for a few days.

134
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:58,909
Why would you stay at a hotel? Just sleep here.

135
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:02,278
My goodness. I can't cause you such inconvenience.

136
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:03,580
Where would he even sleep?

137
00:09:04,409 --> 00:09:06,580
I'll sleep on the couch.

138
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:09,878
Seeing someone enjoy my food so much...

139
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:11,419
makes me so happy.

140
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:14,790
Breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Have all three meals with us.

141
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,560
I'd love to, but... My gosh.

142
00:09:20,129 --> 00:09:21,899
I'll sleep on the couch.

143
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,199
Wait, so you'll sleep here?

144
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,499
I mean, if I were to sleep here.

145
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,430
But I know that it'll make you uncomfortable.

146
00:09:27,529 --> 00:09:30,040
No, it's not about us. You'll be uncomfortable.

147
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,810
No, I won't be. I'm totally fine with it.

148
00:09:33,070 --> 00:09:35,639
- Is this right? - I want to do this.

149
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:38,249
I'm comfortable with this. End of discussion!

150
00:09:38,379 --> 00:09:40,809
You're comfortable? Mom, are you not going to remove your makeup?

151
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:43,149
And why did you suddenly change into this outfit before bed?

152
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,118
Am I not even allowed to wear what I want?

153
00:09:45,119 --> 00:09:47,619
- Woo Ri, you should get changed. - I'll get changed later.

154
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:49,289
This is wrong.

155
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,790
I'm sure he's uncomfortable too. He won't come out of the room.

156
00:09:51,989 --> 00:09:54,899
- Are you watching TV? - Yes! Come join us.

157
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,159
Oh, Grandma. You got changed.

158
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,599
But why are you dressed as if you're going out?

159
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,739
No, I'm wearing my comfy clothes.

160
00:10:04,239 --> 00:10:05,340
Oh, really?

161
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:19,749
Yes!

162
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,889
Raphael, aren't you uncomfortable?

163
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,729
No.

164
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:30,460
I feel...

165
00:10:31,259 --> 00:10:32,899
so at home here.

166
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,269
- Okay. Good night, then. - Good night.

167
00:11:05,670 --> 00:11:07,070
No. I can't wait any longer.

168
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:09,939
- He'll come out. Just wait. - My gosh, Mom!

169
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,369
Who takes a shower for an hour?

170
00:11:12,509 --> 00:11:13,969
What on earth is he doing?

171
00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:15,040
I can't hold it anymore.

172
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,778
You can use the toilet in the outhouse.

173
00:11:17,779 --> 00:11:20,310
I have to wash up and go to work. I'm late.

174
00:11:20,779 --> 00:11:21,920
I wonder if he's okay.

175
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,319
- He's singing. - He's singing?

176
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,420
What?

177
00:11:29,019 --> 00:11:31,119
How could you sing... Hey!

178
00:11:31,889 --> 00:11:32,960
Hold on. Hey!

179
00:11:43,899 --> 00:11:45,739
Thank you for the ride.

180
00:11:46,269 --> 00:11:48,009
I hope you're not running late because of me.

181
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,979
I calculated my route in advance so I wouldn't be late.

182
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:54,279
But you took a shower for an hour?

183
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:55,778
What? What did you say?

184
00:11:55,779 --> 00:11:57,279
What? Oh, it's nothing.

185
00:12:00,489 --> 00:12:03,259
I'm so excited about the next three days.

186
00:12:05,389 --> 00:12:06,489
Right.

187
00:12:07,859 --> 00:12:09,599
Go on in. You'll be late.

188
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,199
I planned the route so you'd arrive right on time.

189
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,799
Hurry up and go on in.

190
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,869
- Bye. - Have a good day.

191
00:12:20,609 --> 00:12:22,340
- What was that? - My gosh, Ms. Yu!

192
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,809
What was that about?

193
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:25,209
A morning date?

194
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:26,709
Must you do this to me knowing I'm single?

195
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:28,109
No, he's doing some repairs...

196
00:12:31,889 --> 00:12:33,018
Hello.

197
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:34,989
Hi, Detective Lee. It's been a while.

198
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,659
Let's talk.

199
00:12:39,659 --> 00:12:42,399
- Sure. - Okay, I'll leave you to it then.

200
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:51,340
Did Raphael sleep at your place last night?

201
00:12:53,269 --> 00:12:54,608
You're tailing me now?

202
00:12:54,609 --> 00:12:55,810
I'm investigating the case.

203
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,580
Kim Bok Rae is the prime suspect in the case.

204
00:12:59,479 --> 00:13:01,719
You, your mother, and even your grandma could be put in danger.

205
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,479
His place needs repairs, so he's staying with us for a few days.

206
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:06,489
Also,

207
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:08,290
there's no way I wouldn't know.

208
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:09,590
What?

209
00:13:09,591 --> 00:13:11,158
Had he been the culprit,

210
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:13,859
I would've known right away when that man grabbed me that day.

211
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:16,259
I know for a fact that it wasn't him.

212
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,529
It was someone else.

213
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:21,070
So make sure you catch the real culprit soon.

214
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:22,470
It's making me anxious.

215
00:13:23,739 --> 00:13:24,840
But...

216
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:27,509
I can assure you that it's not him.

217
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,609
I have to work.

218
00:13:41,149 --> 00:13:42,919
- Thank you! - Thank you!

219
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,329
- Thank you. - No problem. Get home safely.

220
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:48,060
- Thank you. - Of course. You did great.

221
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,659
Ms. Oh Eun Ran?

222
00:13:50,259 --> 00:13:52,600
Yes? How may I help you?

223
00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:55,300
We're from "Trot Jinsunmi".

224
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:00,309
Oh, hello. What is this about?

225
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:01,570
It's about the show, of course.

226
00:14:01,609 --> 00:14:03,809
We're looking for participants for the third season of the show.

227
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:06,108
We were told we'd find a hidden gem here.

228
00:14:06,109 --> 00:14:07,249
We're here to cast you.

229
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:08,580
You can join the show, right?

230
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,479
You're offering me a spot on "Trot Jinsunmi"?

231
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:15,060
- You're back. - Hey.

232
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:18,219
What's going on? Why did you tell us not to have dinner and wait for you?

233
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,089
I picked up some fresh sashimi for all of us.

234
00:14:20,090 --> 00:14:21,460
We have something to celebrate.

235
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,829
What? What is it?

236
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,470
I'm participating in "Trot Jinsunmi".

237
00:14:25,629 --> 00:14:27,930
The main writer and director came to cast me for the show.

238
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:29,600
"Trot Jinsunmi"?

239
00:14:29,899 --> 00:14:32,309
My gosh! Am I dreaming right now?

240
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:34,209
You'll participate in "Trot Jinsunmi"?

241
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:36,638
That's amazing, Mom! Congratulations!

242
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:37,978
Calm down.

243
00:14:37,979 --> 00:14:39,878
They just invited me to participate in the preliminaries.

244
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,820
Of course, they came to cast you because you're talented.

245
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:45,389
Even just participating in that show will make you famous.

246
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:48,759
If you make it to the top three, it's game over!

247
00:14:48,989 --> 00:14:51,118
That's true. Who says I can't win?

248
00:14:51,119 --> 00:14:53,690
Exactly, Mom! I have a good feeling about this.

249
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:56,229
You can do it!

250
00:14:59,029 --> 00:15:01,999
I'm sorry. This must be a hassle for you,

251
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:03,868
but I just love your food so much.

252
00:15:03,869 --> 00:15:07,409
I couldn't resist, so here I am again.

253
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:09,840
Mother, I love your food too.

254
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:12,949
How about I stay here for a few days once Raphael leaves?

255
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:14,779
Hey, this isn't a hotel.

256
00:15:15,379 --> 00:15:16,519
Right.

257
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,988
Then I'll drop by often for food. Is that okay, Mother?

258
00:15:18,989 --> 00:15:21,690
Of course. Like I said, you're always welcome here.

259
00:15:21,889 --> 00:15:23,888
Seeing you eat together at the same table makes me so happy...

260
00:15:23,889 --> 00:15:25,430
that I don't even have to eat.

261
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,258
Mom, you had a lot of sashimi.

262
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:28,329
Hey.

263
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:29,659
It was a figure of speech.

264
00:15:31,729 --> 00:15:33,029
Right, Raphael.

265
00:15:33,129 --> 00:15:35,869
Did you not have a nightmare in that room by any chance?

266
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:38,070
- No. - Did you hear a baby cry at night?

267
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:40,970
No. Why do you ask?

268
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:43,879
I heard a baby died in that room during the Korean War.

269
00:15:43,979 --> 00:15:46,279
Hey, what are you talking about?

270
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:47,379
Come on.

271
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,320
The Korean War?

272
00:15:54,350 --> 00:15:57,019
Hold on. How old is this house, then?

273
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,249
Goodness.

274
00:16:30,659 --> 00:16:31,930
Can I come in for a moment?

275
00:16:33,889 --> 00:16:34,989
Sure.

276
00:16:38,029 --> 00:16:39,430
What's wrong?

277
00:16:39,869 --> 00:16:40,970
At first,

278
00:16:41,229 --> 00:16:42,739
I thought I misheard it,

279
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:45,409
but I keep hearing...

280
00:16:46,609 --> 00:16:48,210
a baby crying.

281
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:50,978
What?

282
00:16:50,979 --> 00:16:53,310
You know, what she said earlier. Is it really true?

283
00:16:53,509 --> 00:16:55,350
There's a baby outside...

284
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,690
No. Of course, it's not true.

285
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:03,158
That's just some cat crying in the woods.

286
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:04,560
No, it's not!

287
00:17:04,659 --> 00:17:06,229
Cats go, "Meow".

288
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:09,629
I swear, there's a baby crying outside.

289
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:11,359
Don't you have cats in your neighborhood?

290
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,300
Cats cry like that when they're in heat.

291
00:17:18,909 --> 00:17:20,709
You're right. My goodness.

292
00:17:22,379 --> 00:17:23,379
Oh, well...

293
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,810
You're reading this too?

294
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,649
This book.

295
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:28,949
Yes.

296
00:17:29,219 --> 00:17:30,619
It's my third time reading it.

297
00:17:30,719 --> 00:17:31,889
Really?

298
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:33,550
Are you reading it because I recommended it?

299
00:17:34,189 --> 00:17:35,389
Nice. I'm glad.

300
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,859
To tell you the truth, I was always a fan of the author.

301
00:17:40,189 --> 00:17:42,760
I even considered going to the author's meet-and-greet.

302
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:45,730
But then, I saw you reading it too.

303
00:17:52,609 --> 00:17:53,669
Well...

304
00:17:53,709 --> 00:17:56,340
Aren't you uncomfortable here?

305
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,980
No, not at all. I love it here.

306
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,520
In fact, we should talk more.

307
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:04,080
But we haven't had a chance to do that.

308
00:18:05,389 --> 00:18:08,619
Oh, what do you say when you're calling the baby?

309
00:18:08,959 --> 00:18:10,959
I call the baby "Gummy Bear".

310
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:14,290
It was as small as a gummy bear when you did your first ultrasound.

311
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:18,300
It's probably a little bigger than that now.

312
00:18:20,570 --> 00:18:23,000
How about we come up with a fetus nickname together?

313
00:18:23,439 --> 00:18:24,639
A fetus nickname?

314
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:27,669
Sure.

315
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:30,639
What would be good?

316
00:18:32,609 --> 00:18:34,280
Your Korean name is Kim Bok Rae, right?

317
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,550
You knew?

318
00:18:42,919 --> 00:18:44,990
Yes, I heard.

319
00:18:45,859 --> 00:18:46,959
Oh, dear.

320
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:50,230
I want people to think I grew up abroad, so I rarely use that name.

321
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:53,969
How about Bok Dol?

322
00:18:55,169 --> 00:18:56,770
You sure are a writer.

323
00:18:57,169 --> 00:18:58,300
Bok Dol!

324
00:18:58,399 --> 00:19:00,340
It just rolls off the tongue. Bok Dol.

325
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,510
Hey, Bok Dol.

326
00:19:03,139 --> 00:19:05,080
From now on, I'll call you Bok Dol.

327
00:19:06,149 --> 00:19:07,280
Kim Bok...

328
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:11,179
Kim Bok Rae's baby, Bok Dol.

329
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:13,250
Bok Dol.

330
00:19:14,449 --> 00:19:17,320
I wonder what Bok Dol will look like.

331
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,389
Woo Ri.

332
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,959
Show me your childhood photos.

333
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:30,570
Should I show you or not?

334
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:34,369
I went through a phase where I did and wore hideous things.

335
00:19:34,510 --> 00:19:36,809
Who cares? That's fine.

336
00:19:36,810 --> 00:19:38,280
I want to see them.

337
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:40,550
What were you like as a kid?

338
00:19:42,879 --> 00:19:44,080
Me? I was cute.

339
00:19:44,219 --> 00:19:45,280
What?

340
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:49,189
- Come again? You were cute? - I sure was.

341
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:05,240
I keep doing this out of habit.

342
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,980
Aren't you going to have dinner?

343
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,449
Hey, Lee Mal Ja!

344
00:20:18,649 --> 00:20:20,550
Are you really not going to talk to me?

345
00:20:24,419 --> 00:20:26,330
What did we ever have?

346
00:20:27,629 --> 00:20:30,929
We couldn't even earn enough money for a proper house...

347
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:32,968
when we worked hard selling drinks...

348
00:20:32,969 --> 00:20:34,069
by the stinky seaside all our lives.

349
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:35,399
But you!

350
00:20:35,639 --> 00:20:38,070
You fell for a guy who used girls to make money.

351
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:45,449
All I could do for you as a mother...

352
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:49,679
was to sit in a wheelchair.

353
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:54,089
That's why. Since you listened to me,

354
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:57,459
you were able to become a CEO's wife...

355
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:59,689
and have people call you madam.

356
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:02,230
Aren't I right?

357
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:04,459
I got divorced.

358
00:21:05,929 --> 00:21:07,698
You know how to speak.

359
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:09,570
Because I listened to you,

360
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,669
her grandmother...

361
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,840
almost died.

362
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,619
Gosh.

363
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:30,119
Gosh. I thought I forgot everything about her.

364
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:36,500
My heart hurts whenever I see her.

365
00:21:38,929 --> 00:21:41,730
Seriously, why is she still with a guy like that?

366
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,300
Kang Jae.

367
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,070
You really need to date someone else.

368
00:21:48,709 --> 00:21:50,240
That way, you can forget about her soon.

369
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,550
I really can't trust anyone.

370
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:58,719
But thank you for believing me.

371
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,290
Kang Jae.

372
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,219
Look at me.

373
00:22:06,929 --> 00:22:08,330
Yes, why?

374
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,629
Consider me as well.

375
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:12,629
I am, aren't I?

376
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,439
Forget it.

377
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,409
Give me your car keys.

378
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:21,939
Hey.

379
00:22:45,969 --> 00:22:47,999
Mother, this is a misunderstanding.

380
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,699
Is this why you came to my house?

381
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:52,168
- Well... - Mom.

382
00:22:52,169 --> 00:22:53,868
Can you do such a thing where grown-ups live?

383
00:22:53,869 --> 00:22:56,309
No, Mother. Really, that's not it.

384
00:22:56,310 --> 00:22:58,309
We were talking about our school days...

385
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,378
- and lost track of time. - I don't want to hear it.

386
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,079
My daughter was never this way.

387
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,849
Mom, that's not it.

388
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:06,188
What's going on? You slept together?

389
00:23:06,189 --> 00:23:08,319
No. It's a misunderstanding.

390
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,819
It's not a misunderstanding.

391
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:11,659
I saw it with my two eyes.

392
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:14,230
If it's spilled milk, there's nothing you can do about it.

393
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:16,459
Raphael, we need to set a date soon.

394
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:19,030
Let's set a date soon and get you married.

395
00:23:19,199 --> 00:23:20,669
Mom, are you out of your mind?

396
00:23:24,869 --> 00:23:27,439
Woo Ri, I told you.

397
00:23:27,609 --> 00:23:30,840
You and him, I don't think it's the right match.

398
00:23:31,639 --> 00:23:34,448
It hurts me that you're saying this about the person I like.

399
00:23:34,449 --> 00:23:36,148
I'm telling you from experience.

400
00:23:36,149 --> 00:23:38,218
That feeling won't last long.

401
00:23:38,219 --> 00:23:40,750
It's just a short fling.

402
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:43,259
He wouldn't have had an interest in you...

403
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,619
if it weren't for the baby.

404
00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:46,759
He's a different kind of person.

405
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:49,300
He's not your match. I don't think it'll work out for you.

406
00:23:49,629 --> 00:23:52,229
You'll only get hurt when that happens.

407
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:53,929
I'm worried about that.

408
00:23:55,669 --> 00:23:57,599
- Thank you. - Thank you.

409
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,168
- Bye. - Thank you.

410
00:23:59,169 --> 00:24:00,368
Bye.

411
00:24:00,369 --> 00:24:02,540
(Oh Eun Ran's Smile Singing School)

412
00:24:07,179 --> 00:24:10,449
I thought I was good at reading the air.

413
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:13,750
But I guess I missed something. I'm sorry.

414
00:24:15,250 --> 00:24:17,918
I tried hard not to show my feelings...

415
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:19,189
for Woo Ri.

416
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,330
I know.

417
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:24,060
Thinking about it, I guess I know exactly why you are this way.

418
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,829
Woo Ri is your precious daughter...

419
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:30,639
and dating a divorcee like me.

420
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:32,340
You must be quite upset.

421
00:24:33,469 --> 00:24:35,909
And I'm the reason why she is pregnant.

422
00:24:37,139 --> 00:24:40,310
And that's why she broke up with her boyfriend.

423
00:24:41,909 --> 00:24:43,349
You know it too well.

424
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:46,149
Yes, I do.

425
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:49,359
But there's a reason I asked her out.

426
00:24:51,119 --> 00:24:52,219
Reason?

427
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:55,760
The situation is difficult right now.

428
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:58,359
But I'm confident that I can make her happy.

429
00:24:59,699 --> 00:25:03,169
I was never this confident in my life.

430
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,138
Since my feelings for Woo Ri are firm,

431
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:08,869
I'm confident that I can stay on track.

432
00:25:09,139 --> 00:25:12,350
I'm more confident than anyone in the world.

433
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,080
Please trust me.

434
00:25:17,179 --> 00:25:20,919
Are you confident that you will never hurt my daughter?

435
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:24,590
Yes, I am.

436
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:28,590
I will prove myself with actions than words.

437
00:25:37,139 --> 00:25:38,240
Ms. Oh Woo Ri?

438
00:25:51,649 --> 00:25:52,919
Come on.

439
00:25:57,859 --> 00:25:58,889
Dad,

440
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:01,659
you should've informed me earlier. What's all this?

441
00:26:01,929 --> 00:26:04,899
Let's have dinner together. Let's eat since you are here.

442
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,929
- Help yourself. - Thank you.

443
00:26:10,469 --> 00:26:12,770
Since you're here. Let me say this quickly.

444
00:26:13,609 --> 00:26:16,609
I'd like for you to make your decision soon.

445
00:26:17,109 --> 00:26:20,309
Gosh, Dad. Don't do this. Don't.

446
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,679
No, but I must.

447
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:24,580
The faster you get married,

448
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:27,520
the better it is for the baby.

449
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,760
He says I'm being hasty.

450
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:34,389
But some live happily after getting married in a month.

451
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:36,359
Ms. Oh.

452
00:26:37,659 --> 00:26:40,530
Are you not considering marriage, by any chance?

453
00:26:44,939 --> 00:26:46,468
No, it's not that.

454
00:26:46,469 --> 00:26:47,869
That's fine then.

455
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:53,010
And one other thing that I'm concerned about is...

456
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,218
your work in the entertainment business.

457
00:26:57,219 --> 00:26:58,480
It must be hard.

458
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:02,349
I enjoy doing it, so I don't find it difficult.

459
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:04,020
Right.

460
00:27:06,389 --> 00:27:09,500
I think you should slowly start to end things at work...

461
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,300
and focus on the baby now.

462
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:15,129
And when you get married you shouldn't work.

463
00:27:16,139 --> 00:27:18,898
Both couples work when you need the money.

464
00:27:18,899 --> 00:27:21,639
- But you don't have to with us. - You should really stop.

465
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:24,840
Woo Ri, you must be uncomfortable. Let's go.

466
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:28,810
Why would we when he's treating us to nice food?

467
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:37,790
I'll keep in mind the things you are saying.

468
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:41,029
However, what you think...

469
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:43,230
and what I think may be different.

470
00:27:43,859 --> 00:27:45,759
I'll consider it carefully...

471
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,969
and make the final decision myself.

472
00:28:02,679 --> 00:28:04,919
My dad's a bit insisting.

473
00:28:05,619 --> 00:28:07,990
Just let go of the things you don't want to hear.

474
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:11,619
He's just worried, that's all.

475
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:16,830
And I do understand why he wants us to hurry up with the marriage.

476
00:28:20,429 --> 00:28:21,570
But...

477
00:28:24,969 --> 00:28:28,540
I want to do this at my pace and not others.

478
00:28:30,109 --> 00:28:31,139
Of course.

479
00:28:31,379 --> 00:28:33,909
You should think carefully and make up your mind.

480
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,379
And thank you for understanding my dad.

481
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,859
It's Grandmother.

482
00:28:46,429 --> 00:28:47,590
Yes, Grandmother?

483
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:51,499
- Pardon? - What is it?

484
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,929
I had dinner already.

485
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,799
Then you should've called. I waited.

486
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:57,869
Right.

487
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:01,810
I'm sorry. I should've called.

488
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:04,840
No, we're nearby. We'll be home soon.

489
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,010
All right then.

490
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:15,218
I didn't know we should've called.

491
00:29:15,219 --> 00:29:17,389
Why? What did she say?

492
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:20,958
She said I needed to call ahead if I'm eating out.

493
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:23,429
What? You didn't call her?

494
00:29:24,199 --> 00:29:26,300
- No, I didn't. - I called.

495
00:29:26,429 --> 00:29:30,270
I have lived alone since middle school,

496
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:32,040
so I didn't know I had to.

497
00:29:32,669 --> 00:29:33,840
What do I do?

498
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,810
It's okay.

499
00:29:41,609 --> 00:29:43,480
I just got scolded by Grandmother.

500
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:46,919
- But why do I feel good? - What?

501
00:29:47,389 --> 00:29:49,859
This must be what family is like.

502
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:56,659
Gosh, I have to go back tomorrow.

503
00:29:57,199 --> 00:29:59,060
Time really flies.

504
00:30:00,530 --> 00:30:03,840
I'd like to stay a few more days. But if I do that,

505
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,069
it would be an inconvenience, wouldn't it?

506
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,668
- Yes, it would. - Right.

507
00:30:07,669 --> 00:30:09,240
Wait, what? What did you say?

508
00:30:10,109 --> 00:30:11,639
I'm sorry. I'm only joking.

509
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:17,080
Shall we walk holding hands until the end of the street there?

510
00:30:21,350 --> 00:30:22,419
Yes.

511
00:30:28,129 --> 00:30:30,060
I had a great time. Thanks to you, Grandmother.

512
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:31,629
That's great.

513
00:30:31,699 --> 00:30:34,000
Come anytime like it's your home.

514
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:35,570
(Seo Gwi Nyeo's Pork Cutlet)

515
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:36,869
Raphael,

516
00:30:36,969 --> 00:30:38,869
you can't go to the TV station since you need to go to work, right?

517
00:30:40,609 --> 00:30:42,240
Can I go there as well?

518
00:30:42,909 --> 00:30:45,209
You can if you want to. Nobody's stopping you.

519
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,320
I already took a day off today.

520
00:30:50,919 --> 00:30:52,449
Let's go.

521
00:30:58,820 --> 00:30:59,990
Gosh.

522
00:31:00,689 --> 00:31:02,259
What is this?

523
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,398
This isn't me.

524
00:31:03,399 --> 00:31:05,358
(Oh Eun Ran, the rising star of Trot)

525
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:06,629
Seoung Il.

526
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:08,129
What is this?

527
00:31:08,699 --> 00:31:11,570
I had it ready to serve everyone comfortably.

528
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:14,039
Wouldn't people think that Jang Yoon Jeong is in it...

529
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,079
if we ride in this?

530
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,879
Eun Ran is better at singing.

531
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:19,649
Eun Ran,

532
00:31:19,949 --> 00:31:22,679
you look really beautiful today.

533
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:26,290
Don't be nervous. Just do it with energy.

534
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:27,849
I'm not nervous.

535
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:29,590
I'll just be myself.

536
00:31:29,859 --> 00:31:31,289
You're being so particular.

537
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:33,129
Aren't you too relaxed?

538
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:35,188
Didn't I tell you to only take a calming pill?

539
00:31:35,189 --> 00:31:36,800
Gosh, Mom.

540
00:31:36,899 --> 00:31:38,959
Who else is coming?

541
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,330
Right, your boyfriend.

542
00:31:41,570 --> 00:31:44,570
Seoung Il, they broke up. Didn't you know?

543
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:46,969
What?

544
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,070
I didn't know.

545
00:31:49,169 --> 00:31:50,280
When?

546
00:31:50,639 --> 00:31:52,909
It's a bit hectic. I need to focus.

547
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:57,379
Right. Let's go.

548
00:31:58,050 --> 00:31:59,179
Let's go!

549
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:02,320
Gosh, you didn't need to go this far.

550
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:04,260
This is too much.

551
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:10,760
Hello.

552
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:14,129
I'm Oh Eun Ran. Participant 142.

553
00:32:16,639 --> 00:32:18,439
Let's hear you sing then.

554
00:32:18,639 --> 00:32:19,639
Yes.

555
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,669
(Trot Jinsunmi)

556
00:32:25,179 --> 00:32:26,879
(Let's go Eun Ran!)

557
00:32:46,869 --> 00:32:52,000
I don't know yet

558
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:56,879
What the eyes that met are saying

559
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:02,178
I don't know

560
00:33:02,179 --> 00:33:04,820
I really don't know

561
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:10,259
My heart just beats

562
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,858
Oh,

563
00:33:11,859 --> 00:33:13,158
(Let's go Eun Ran!)

564
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:17,359
It must have been love

565
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:23,300
I don't know yet

566
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,240
What the whispering gaze is saying

567
00:33:30,209 --> 00:33:33,309
I don't know

568
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:35,980
I really don't know

569
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:41,448
My heart just beats

570
00:33:41,449 --> 00:33:48,060
Oh, it must have been love

571
00:33:48,959 --> 00:33:54,070
Sitting by the window when the sun sets

572
00:33:55,030 --> 00:34:01,239
I am picturing you

573
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:04,408
Telling me that you love me

574
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:07,149
Telling me you like me

575
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:13,049
Tell me just like that

576
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:18,989
I will become a beautiful star like a teardrop

577
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:25,759
In your heart

578
00:34:54,929 --> 00:34:56,830
Oh Eun Ran, you're number one.

579
00:34:58,730 --> 00:34:59,969
Well done.

580
00:35:01,069 --> 00:35:02,170
You have passed.

581
00:35:03,699 --> 00:35:05,270
(Let's go Eun Ran!)

582
00:35:07,509 --> 00:35:08,670
Thank you.

583
00:35:08,869 --> 00:35:09,880
Thank you so much.

584
00:35:13,009 --> 00:35:14,210
Mom.

585
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,350
- Good job, Mom. - Well done.

586
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,519
Well done.

587
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,619
Good job.

588
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:27,759
Oh my gosh.

589
00:35:35,569 --> 00:35:37,669
You really improved in singing.

590
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:39,838
- I had goosebumps. - Really?

591
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:42,239
Mom, that was the best performance.

592
00:35:42,339 --> 00:35:44,779
I was so engaged in the emotions.

593
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,409
- Where did Duk Chil go? - I'm not sure.

594
00:35:50,049 --> 00:35:51,219
Ma Ri.

595
00:35:52,679 --> 00:35:54,690
What is it? Is it urgent?

596
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:57,219
If we don't execute it now, there could be big setbacks.

597
00:35:57,690 --> 00:35:58,989
That's why I came.

598
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,460
Right.

599
00:36:06,929 --> 00:36:09,270
Do you think I would have made you smile like that...

600
00:36:10,339 --> 00:36:12,669
if I was raised in a happy household?

601
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:13,969
Excuse me?

602
00:36:16,540 --> 00:36:17,779
No, nothing.

603
00:36:33,029 --> 00:36:34,059
Bye.

604
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,329
- Good job. - Bye.

605
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:38,158
Mr. Kang. Ms. Lee. Good job today.

606
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:39,630
And thank you.

607
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:42,369
Seoung Il, if you are grateful,

608
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,569
let's work on the variety show...

609
00:36:44,799 --> 00:36:46,738
I told you about once more.

610
00:36:46,739 --> 00:36:48,810
All right.

611
00:36:50,339 --> 00:36:51,508
How was she today?

612
00:36:51,509 --> 00:36:53,809
She seemed to be a bit nervous.

613
00:36:53,810 --> 00:36:55,009
Seoung Il.

614
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:56,520
Can I be honest?

615
00:36:57,549 --> 00:36:59,319
I passed her because of you.

616
00:37:00,619 --> 00:37:03,319
She's charming and has character.

617
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,789
But with her singing skills,

618
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:06,089
it'll be difficult in the main round.

619
00:37:06,489 --> 00:37:09,029
You know that there are so many skilled singers.

620
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:13,029
Right.

621
00:37:14,429 --> 00:37:15,630
Okay.

622
00:37:16,299 --> 00:37:17,440
Mr. Kang.

623
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:20,039
I'll try my best...

624
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,569
to go on that variety show that you're planning.

625
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,909
Let's have her go on the main round.

626
00:37:25,279 --> 00:37:26,449
She should go to the main round.

627
00:37:27,279 --> 00:37:29,979
You promised. There's no turning back.

628
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:32,779
You passed the first round.

629
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:35,719
Now you need to pass the second round and go to the main round.

630
00:37:36,089 --> 00:37:37,419
I want to leave when everyone's cheering.

631
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:40,960
Right. I'll clap for you like this when you go on to the main round.

632
00:37:41,790 --> 00:37:43,130
Duk Chil.

633
00:37:43,259 --> 00:37:44,730
What is it?

634
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:46,529
You're really trying so hard.

635
00:37:47,369 --> 00:37:49,699
For Mom and for Woo Ri.

636
00:37:50,069 --> 00:37:51,239
And for me.

637
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:54,940
Gosh.

638
00:37:56,069 --> 00:37:57,580
I promised.

639
00:37:57,839 --> 00:37:59,639
I said I'd do better...

640
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:01,980
for all those times I've missed out on.

641
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:16,900
- Gosh. - I almost fell for it.

642
00:38:22,699 --> 00:38:23,869
Mom, are you all right?

643
00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:27,009
I really liked your performance today.

644
00:38:27,409 --> 00:38:28,940
Why do you want to stop here?

645
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:31,509
Woo Ri.

646
00:38:31,779 --> 00:38:34,779
Would you like me to be successful as a singer?

647
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,819
I would.

648
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:42,219
What if I can't become anything after trying to reach my dreams?

649
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,318
Mom.

650
00:38:46,319 --> 00:38:48,330
I really like it when you sing.

651
00:38:48,589 --> 00:38:50,600
You look the happiest when you do.

652
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,669
Don't think of other things...

653
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:55,270
and just do what you want to.

654
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:02,710
Mom. Well...

655
00:39:03,069 --> 00:39:05,909
You seem a bit more relaxed around Raphael.

656
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,580
You took him to the TV station and all.

657
00:39:09,009 --> 00:39:12,679
He seemed like a better person than what I worried about.

658
00:39:13,190 --> 00:39:14,920
I want to take a look at him for a while.

659
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,060
I...

660
00:39:18,319 --> 00:39:20,830
was summoned by his father.

661
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:24,659
He wanted us to get married soon.

662
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:26,670
Grandma seems to want the same.

663
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:31,138
I understand their positions...

664
00:39:31,139 --> 00:39:33,909
You'll regret it if you decide based on what they say.

665
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:36,838
You need to make your own decisions.

666
00:39:36,839 --> 00:39:39,080
Don't worry about it and do what you want.

667
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:43,819
It's only been a short while since we got close.

668
00:39:44,179 --> 00:39:45,949
And marriage seems like it's in the far future.

669
00:39:47,389 --> 00:39:50,560
I want to do this my way and at my pace.

670
00:39:51,089 --> 00:39:52,989
I don't want to be pushed into things.

671
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:55,658
But fortunately,

672
00:39:55,659 --> 00:39:58,630
he thinks the same way as I, and he respects my thoughts.

673
00:39:58,730 --> 00:39:59,830
Good.

674
00:40:00,569 --> 00:40:03,499
You shouldn't get married in haste because of the baby.

675
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,999
You should take your time and make that decision...

676
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:07,009
when you're ready, so you won't regret it later.

677
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:09,509
- Okay? - Okay.

678
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,250
Mom, how about a drink together?

679
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:14,880
Shall we?

680
00:40:15,549 --> 00:40:16,549
Cheers.

681
00:40:42,069 --> 00:40:44,139
Do you know how other regular families are?

682
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:50,350
It's been a while since you talked to me.

683
00:40:51,779 --> 00:40:53,719
If we were like everyone else,

684
00:40:55,049 --> 00:40:57,089
I would have been happy with Raphael.

685
00:40:58,420 --> 00:41:00,360
Happy?

686
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:07,500
I...

687
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:28,790
Mom!

688
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:39,199
When your good-for-nothing dad died,

689
00:41:45,199 --> 00:41:48,369
I thought several times about ending my life too.

690
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:52,279
But you kept me alive.

691
00:41:54,179 --> 00:41:56,150
When our gas was cut off,

692
00:41:56,279 --> 00:41:58,750
we boiled water, put it in a bottle, and hugged it at night.

693
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:02,149
I did everything I could,

694
00:42:02,150 --> 00:42:04,020
so people wouldn't think you were poor.

695
00:42:05,619 --> 00:42:06,759
Gosh.

696
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,630
Goodness.

697
00:42:13,969 --> 00:42:16,770
You made me keep going despite everything.

698
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:18,299
You did.

699
00:42:20,969 --> 00:42:24,440
I was in a wheelchair for three years to help you.

700
00:42:26,139 --> 00:42:29,409
But you won't forgive me, right?

701
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:34,190
You won't work with me anymore, right?

702
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:36,219
Thought so.

703
00:42:39,259 --> 00:42:40,989
That's the end of us, right?

704
00:42:42,759 --> 00:42:44,060
It's over, isn't it?

705
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,000
I really hate you!

706
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:53,270
What?

707
00:42:56,139 --> 00:42:57,779
You conned your own daughter.

708
00:42:58,639 --> 00:43:01,009
And now that I caught you, you want us to be over?

709
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:03,479
You won't even talk to me!

710
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:07,350
Yes! I won't work with you anymore!

711
00:43:08,049 --> 00:43:11,089
I'm going to stop conning people now!

712
00:43:12,889 --> 00:43:14,929
And that means it's over between us?

713
00:43:15,889 --> 00:43:17,759
There won't be a reason for us to see each other?

714
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:20,099
We're all each other has in this world!

715
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:22,029
How could we cut off ties?

716
00:43:25,569 --> 00:43:27,739
Mom, I'm your family.

717
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:31,040
Familial bonds...

718
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,779
can't be broken until death.

719
00:43:41,889 --> 00:43:42,920
Seriously.

720
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:47,560
You have no place to go. Why did you pack your stuff?

721
00:44:58,560 --> 00:44:59,929
I hear in people's last moments,

722
00:45:00,770 --> 00:45:03,500
the happiest memories they have flash before their eyes.

723
00:45:05,799 --> 00:45:08,310
Personally, the three days I spent at your mother's house...

724
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:09,909
are my happiest moments for now.

725
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:19,920
Bok Dol.

726
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:25,389
Daddy wants to make a happy family.

727
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:28,790
I thought a lot about it,

728
00:45:29,830 --> 00:45:31,299
and now, I'm finally ready.

729
00:45:33,799 --> 00:45:37,069
I didn't know I would feel certain this fast.

730
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:52,580
Gosh. Why isn't there anything?

731
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:55,650
What was the necklace in the safe?

732
00:45:56,589 --> 00:45:59,060
Did I fall into the trap to frame Kim Bok Rae?

733
00:46:05,759 --> 00:46:07,500
What? Hold on.

734
00:46:55,779 --> 00:46:58,278
It's the left foot. Right foot in front of the left foot.

735
00:46:58,279 --> 00:47:00,519
In 1, 2, 3. 1.

736
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:03,048
Jump. Left foot. Left side.

737
00:47:03,049 --> 00:47:04,060
There you go.

738
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:06,790
- One. Jump. - What's he doing now?

739
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:09,790
- Left arm. Left foot. Left side. - That...

740
00:47:15,799 --> 00:47:17,469
Hey, Na Hee. What is it?

741
00:47:19,199 --> 00:47:21,368
I told you I would keep digging when you got benched.

742
00:47:21,369 --> 00:47:22,469
This is it.

743
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,480
If he secretly gave new faces to the criminals,

744
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:27,610
a doctor must have done the surgery.

745
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:29,749
Lee Jong Gu, No Man Chul, and Shin Mi Young.

746
00:47:29,750 --> 00:47:31,319
They all gambled at the same parlor.

752

Lee Jong Gu. Yes, he's a doctor.

753
00:47:45,029 --> 00:47:47,000
I heard people with good jobs loved places like this.

754
00:47:47,569 --> 00:47:50,198
Hey, you'll win some tomorrow. Dr. Lee is going home. Say bye.

755
00:47:50,199 --> 00:47:51,369
- Bye. - Bye.

756
00:47:54,069 --> 00:47:57,210
If he has the list we're looking for, it's over.

757
00:47:58,279 --> 00:47:59,440
You want to go there now?

758
00:48:00,350 --> 00:48:02,409
We don't have a warrant. You can't barge in there.

759
00:48:02,850 --> 00:48:04,678
If we report this to the higher-ups and follow the protocol,

760
00:48:04,679 --> 00:48:05,880
we can't catch Chairman Kim.

Kang Jae! Hold on!

762
00:48:08,350 --> 00:48:11,520
Right here. I can give you double eyelids here.

763
00:48:11,659 --> 00:48:14,889
As for the fat under your eyes, I can reposition it.

764
00:48:15,089 --> 00:48:18,630
And I can finish with a facelift.

765
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:20,230
Okay.

766
00:48:21,969 --> 00:48:23,028

You can't do this here.

- Hey. - What's this about?

773

- Are you Lee Jong Gu? - Yes.

00:53:51,631 --> 00:53:53,429
who did plastic surgery for the criminals?

827
00:53:54,369 --> 00:53:56,230
As soon as you approached him, he turned up dead?

828
00:53:57,199 --> 00:53:59,369
You didn't find the murder weapon at the scene?

829
00:53:59,869 --> 00:54:00,969
No.

830
00:54:01,810 --> 00:54:04,480
But the stab wound on the neck matches Chairman Kim's MO.

831
00:54:05,839 --> 00:54:07,139
Before Lee Jong Gu died,

832
00:54:07,339 --> 00:54:09,779
he asked for my help and said he knew who Chairman Kim was.

833
00:54:10,009 --> 00:54:11,679
I'm sure Chairman Kim killed him.

834
00:54:14,449 --> 00:54:17,489
Someone from Diamond was murdered again. Gosh.

835
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:20,489
Hey, something isn't right here.

836
00:54:22,529 --> 00:54:24,259
Where's Na Hee?

837
00:54:26,799 --> 00:54:28,099
(I did everything you asked. I only did it because you said...)

838
00:54:28,100 --> 00:54:29,600
(no one would get hurt. I'm done helping you. I'll catch you myself!)

839
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:36,339
(I'm done helping you. I'll catch you myself!)

840
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:40,079
(If you catch me, it'll be over for you too.)

841
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:42,380
(Let's see if you can catch me.)

842
00:54:46,949 --> 00:54:50,960
(I'll catch you myself and kill you. Then it'll be all over.)

843
00:54:55,190 --> 00:54:56,529
Gosh.

844
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:02,630
Captain!

845
00:55:03,199 --> 00:55:05,170
The security camera at the entrance caught someone we all know.

846
00:55:10,170 --> 00:55:11,380
Look at this.

847
00:55:36,230 --> 00:55:38,540
I thought a lot about it,

848
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:41,909
and I put a lot of effort into it. But I failed.

849
00:55:44,810 --> 00:55:46,639
I don't know, Raphael.

850
00:55:48,310 --> 00:55:50,480
I thought we had the same pace.

851
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:56,790
I rarely felt this sure of something in my life.

852
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:01,960
It's been only a month since we talked about our feelings.

853
00:56:02,130 --> 00:56:03,758
Is it possible you brought up marriage...

854
00:56:03,759 --> 00:56:06,460
for another reason, not because you felt sure of us?

855
00:56:08,069 --> 00:56:10,199
What other reason could there be?

856
00:56:10,469 --> 00:56:12,500
I'm thinking about Bok Dol the most.

857
00:56:16,839 --> 00:56:18,639
So that's what this was to you too.

858
00:56:20,339 --> 00:56:21,480
Pardon?

859
00:56:21,710 --> 00:56:22,949
It's about the baby, isn't it?

860
00:56:23,549 --> 00:56:24,979
You proposed to me for the baby's sake,

861
00:56:24,980 --> 00:56:26,449
not because of your feelings for me.

862
00:56:28,290 --> 00:56:29,489
What...

863
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:31,460
We're having a baby.

864
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:33,189
Why is that weird?

865
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:35,528
I like you for who you are,

866
00:56:35,529 --> 00:56:37,729
not because you're the baby's father.

867
00:56:37,730 --> 00:56:40,059
I like you for who you are too.

868
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:42,330
I'm not forcing myself to like you for the baby's sake.

869
00:56:47,909 --> 00:56:51,139
I didn't know my proposal would upset you.

870
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:55,249
No. There was nothing wrong with your proposal.

871
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:58,549
I just think that it's not normal to think about marriage now.

872
00:57:10,130 --> 00:57:11,198
Woo Ri.

873
00:57:11,199 --> 00:57:13,130
What's so bad about marriage?

874
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:15,900
You can't say that if you really care about the baby.

875
00:57:16,929 --> 00:57:18,198
I'm going to marry...

876
00:57:18,199 --> 00:57:21,008
the man I'll spend the rest of my life with.

877
00:57:21,009 --> 00:57:23,770
I will never get married for a different reason.

878
00:57:23,869 --> 00:57:25,239
And that's what's best for the baby.

879
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:27,178
Marrying me, the father of the baby,

880
00:57:27,179 --> 00:57:28,949
is what's good for the baby.

881
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:31,849
Woo Ri. You're telling me...

882
00:57:31,850 --> 00:57:33,719
your feelings are more important than the baby's happiness.

883
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:35,818
That's way too selfish.

884
00:57:35,819 --> 00:57:38,560
No. That's what's best for the baby, not me!

885
00:57:57,139 --> 00:57:59,839
Is marrying for the sake of giving the baby a father good for the baby?

886
00:58:02,949 --> 00:58:04,279
How could you say that to me?

887
00:58:04,449 --> 00:58:05,750
I'm the baby's father.

888
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:08,789
My mother and my grandmother...

889
00:58:08,790 --> 00:58:10,960
raised me well without husbands.

890
00:58:11,889 --> 00:58:14,020
Is not having a father bad for the baby?

891
00:58:14,560 --> 00:58:15,829
So...

892
00:58:15,830 --> 00:58:18,528
if I force myself to get married, lying to myself about my feelings,

893
00:58:18,529 --> 00:58:20,129
will that make the baby happy?

894
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:21,270
Woo Ri!

895
00:58:30,310 --> 00:58:31,710
I can raise this baby well...

896
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:34,040
even if I have to do it by myself.

897
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:24,960
(Woori the Virgin)

898
00:59:25,159 --> 00:59:27,059
I felt lost before.

899
00:59:27,060 --> 00:59:28,799
But now, I know I can do everything.

900
00:59:28,869 --> 00:59:31,769
I want to undo what happened, but I don't know how.

901
00:59:31,770 --> 00:59:33,069
You're all I need.

902
00:59:33,199 --> 00:59:34,868
I hope you know that I mean it.

903
00:59:34,869 --> 00:59:36,210
- Date me! - Date me, please!

904
00:59:36,839 --> 00:59:38,210
The police did what to you?

905
00:59:38,810 --> 00:59:40,040
Hey, we caught Chairman Kim!

906
00:59:40,279 --> 00:59:41,448
It's over now.

907
00:59:41,449 --> 00:59:43,709
Fleeing right now is a serious offense!

908
00:59:43,710 --> 00:59:45,318
The chairman didn't run away.

909
00:59:45,319 --> 00:59:46,880
It's the perpetrator who was at my house.

910
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:48,488
I followed the perpetrator.

911
00:59:48,489 --> 00:59:50,190
He must be Chairman Kim!

912
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:52,290
Get out of the car!

913
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:01,770
(Woori the Virgin)
