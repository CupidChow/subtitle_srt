00:00:08,352 --> 00:00:12,352
(Im Soo Hyang as Oh Woo Ri)

(Sung Hoon as Raphael)

(Shin Dong Wook as Lee Kang Jae)

(Hong Eun Hee as Oh Eun Ran, Yeon Woon Kyung as Seo Gwi Nyeo)

(Hong Ji Yun as Lee Ma Ri, Joo Jin Mo as Chairman)

00:00:25,133 --> 00:00:27,101
(Nam Mi Jung as Byun Mi Ja)

(And Kim Soo Ro as Choi Seoung Il)

(Woori the Virgin)

9
00:00:39,282 --> 00:00:41,252
Is this...

10
00:00:42,953 --> 00:00:44,252
a dream?

11
00:01:18,582 --> 00:01:19,952
What did I just do?

12
00:01:19,953 --> 00:01:22,222
- Well... - What did I do?

13
00:01:23,222 --> 00:01:25,122
- What on earth did I do? - I was thinking the same...

14
00:01:25,123 --> 00:01:27,191
- What on earth did I just do? - Ms. Oh!

15
00:01:27,192 --> 00:01:28,532
What on earth did I just do?

16
00:01:41,242 --> 00:01:44,172
What was that? I can't believe I did that!

17
00:01:44,173 --> 00:01:46,513
What the heck was that?

18
00:01:48,112 --> 00:01:50,313
(Episode 9)

19
00:02:01,832 --> 00:02:04,702
(Seo Gwi Nyeo's Pork Cutlet)

20
00:02:04,703 --> 00:02:06,903
Woo Ri, are you not feeling well?

21
00:02:08,073 --> 00:02:10,532
Did something happen? What's wrong?

22
00:02:10,873 --> 00:02:12,703
I thought life...

23
00:02:13,902 --> 00:02:18,013
was all about swimming toward your destination,

24
00:02:18,742 --> 00:02:20,142
but I guess I was wrong.

25
00:02:21,883 --> 00:02:24,422
This world is like a vast ocean,

26
00:02:24,423 --> 00:02:26,522
so you don't even know where you're going.

27
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:30,853
I suppose all you can do is go with the tide.

28
00:02:30,953 --> 00:02:32,062
What's she saying?

29
00:02:32,663 --> 00:02:35,132
Woo Ri, have dinner first.

30
00:02:35,133 --> 00:02:36,591
We can talk about this later.

31
00:02:36,592 --> 00:02:38,703
- Come out. - Come on. Hurry.

32
00:02:42,673 --> 00:02:45,443
You kissed him? All of a sudden?

33
00:02:45,902 --> 00:02:47,842
Even though nothing happened before that?

34
00:02:49,642 --> 00:02:52,013
- Yes. - I wonder why you did it.

35
00:02:53,612 --> 00:02:55,413
Is it because you're pregnant with his child?

36
00:02:55,953 --> 00:02:57,612
You got pregnant without sleeping with him,

37
00:02:58,082 --> 00:03:01,923
but is it possible that you want him now that you're carrying his child?

38
00:03:04,522 --> 00:03:05,723
Do you like him?

39
00:03:07,862 --> 00:03:08,961
I guess, a little.

40
00:03:08,962 --> 00:03:11,802
Right, it'd be weird if you didn't.

41
00:03:11,902 --> 00:03:13,633
On top of being handsome and competent,

42
00:03:13,703 --> 00:03:14,973
he's the father of your baby.

43
00:03:16,473 --> 00:03:17,973
He is the father of the baby.

44
00:03:18,772 --> 00:03:22,943
Hey. If things work out, it'll be amazing for the baby.

45
00:03:23,312 --> 00:03:24,842
And if you two end up together,

46
00:03:25,082 --> 00:03:27,582
I can get the facial treatments even after the drama ends.

47
00:03:31,853 --> 00:03:34,752
If you want an ending that is even more dramatic...

48
00:03:34,753 --> 00:03:36,353
than what we see in dramas,

49
00:03:36,652 --> 00:03:38,423
you must create it for yourself...

50
00:03:38,962 --> 00:03:40,293
because it's your life.

51
00:03:41,892 --> 00:03:43,432
I'm always on your side.

52
00:03:46,263 --> 00:03:48,133
Thank you, Ms. Yu.

53
00:03:48,832 --> 00:03:51,342
By the way, has Raphael gotten everything sorted out yet?

54
00:03:51,973 --> 00:03:54,642
- Sorry? - He's divorced now, right?

55
00:03:57,783 --> 00:03:58,913
(Court)

56
00:04:05,022 --> 00:04:08,793
We got a divorce as you'd wanted, but my feelings won't change.

57
00:04:09,152 --> 00:04:10,453
Just know that.

58
00:04:10,622 --> 00:04:11,762
Enough, seriously.

59
00:04:11,763 --> 00:04:14,122
Just move on and live your life. You're still young.

60
00:04:14,323 --> 00:04:15,362
I'm off.

61
00:04:16,592 --> 00:04:17,633
What?

62
00:04:18,103 --> 00:04:19,763
Let's grab a bite to eat.

63
00:04:21,002 --> 00:04:23,002
Why should I eat with you? We're divorced now.

64
00:04:23,903 --> 00:04:24,942
I'm off.

65
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,843
Is it right that I agreed to divorce?

66
00:04:30,343 --> 00:04:32,742
Maybe I should've stayed stubborn and held out until the end.

67
00:04:33,413 --> 00:04:35,251
Even the chairman isn't on your side.

68
00:04:35,252 --> 00:04:36,413
What else could you have done?

69
00:04:36,713 --> 00:04:39,022
You would've gotten kicked out empty-handed.

70
00:04:39,023 --> 00:04:41,893
- Then it's all over now. - No!

71
00:04:42,153 --> 00:04:44,121
This is only a strategic retreat.

72
00:04:44,122 --> 00:04:46,761
The Star Cafe building is within our reach!

73
00:04:46,762 --> 00:04:50,232
Mom, how will we get our hands on it in this situation?

74
00:04:50,233 --> 00:04:53,663
Raphael will come back to you unless he meets another woman.

75
00:04:54,233 --> 00:04:55,302
What?

76
00:04:56,233 --> 00:04:57,273
Ma Ri.

77
00:05:00,002 --> 00:05:01,773
Raphael is a man too.

78
00:05:02,143 --> 00:05:04,582
When men see a beautiful woman,

79
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:07,482
their bodies automatically react.

80
00:05:07,483 --> 00:05:10,811
You can keep men wrapped around your little finger,

81
00:05:10,812 --> 00:05:12,423
for years to come!

82
00:05:13,723 --> 00:05:16,393
It's true that your daughter is beautiful.

83
00:05:19,062 --> 00:05:21,932
All men are the same.

84
00:05:22,463 --> 00:05:25,932
What's the animal whose body reacts before its brain does?

85
00:05:26,002 --> 00:05:27,202
Men!

86
00:05:27,362 --> 00:05:31,272
Then since Raphael is a man too, his body will react first.

87
00:05:31,273 --> 00:05:33,302
That's right!

88
00:05:44,682 --> 00:05:45,853
Gummy Bear.

89
00:05:46,583 --> 00:05:47,853
Was that a dream?

90
00:05:50,692 --> 00:05:52,622
Did I dream about the thing that happened with your mom?

91
00:05:56,033 --> 00:05:58,033
Is this...

92
00:05:58,932 --> 00:06:00,132
a dream?

93
00:06:04,742 --> 00:06:06,872
Gosh, I miss her.

94
00:06:08,413 --> 00:06:12,482
Please, Ms. Yu. I really can't run into him.

95
00:06:12,483 --> 00:06:14,111
Hey, I already checked.

96
00:06:14,112 --> 00:06:17,412
Raphael is away on a work trip. That's why I brought you along.

97
00:06:17,413 --> 00:06:19,352
Wait! You're sure, right?

98
00:06:19,353 --> 00:06:21,593
Do you have trust issues? Come on!

99
00:06:22,452 --> 00:06:24,153
See you, Woo Ri!

100
00:06:35,002 --> 00:06:36,333
Hello.

101
00:06:37,533 --> 00:06:39,242
Well...

102
00:06:39,773 --> 00:06:43,712
You know, the other day. That was rude of me.

103
00:06:43,713 --> 00:06:45,612
I sincerely apologize.

104
00:06:46,012 --> 00:06:47,083
Ms. Oh.

105
00:06:48,452 --> 00:06:49,983
That wasn't a dream.

106
00:06:50,783 --> 00:06:53,023
Right, it wasn't.

107
00:06:53,983 --> 00:06:57,452
I'm pregnant, you know. It must be the hormones.

108
00:06:57,853 --> 00:06:59,262
I like you.

109
00:07:00,023 --> 00:07:01,062
Sorry?

110
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:04,733
My feelings for you kept growing,

111
00:07:06,202 --> 00:07:09,103
but I thought it'd make you uncomfortable,

112
00:07:09,432 --> 00:07:10,702
so I couldn't tell you.

113
00:07:15,312 --> 00:07:18,543
I always felt that there was someone out there...

114
00:07:19,043 --> 00:07:22,153
who I was destined to be with.

115
00:07:24,723 --> 00:07:26,252
I think that person was you.

116
00:07:31,562 --> 00:07:34,762
Why does this feel so surreal?

117
00:07:39,362 --> 00:07:41,233
Am I dreaming right now?

118
00:07:43,403 --> 00:07:44,872
No, I told you this wasn't a dream.

119
00:07:48,512 --> 00:07:49,572
I'll...

120
00:07:50,843 --> 00:07:52,143
show you.

121
00:08:30,812 --> 00:08:34,022
- Hello? - Sir, we need you here now.

122
00:08:34,023 --> 00:08:35,492
The police are here again.

123
00:08:36,952 --> 00:08:40,422
No. Look at that ventilation fan. That tells it all.

124
00:08:40,423 --> 00:08:41,831
They manufactured illicit drugs here.

125
00:08:41,832 --> 00:08:44,292
That vent fan is way too small for that.

126
00:08:44,293 --> 00:08:45,462
When you make drugs,

127
00:08:45,663 --> 00:08:47,662
you need something to remove all the fumes.

128
00:08:47,663 --> 00:08:49,002
Had they done it here,

129
00:08:49,003 --> 00:08:51,572
everyone would've known because of the odor.

130
00:08:52,472 --> 00:08:55,773
Dr. Jang, I know you retired from the manufacturing side long ago.

131
00:08:57,043 --> 00:08:58,711
The synthetic drugs they make these days...

132
00:08:58,712 --> 00:09:01,283
don't produce any odors during the manufacturing process.

133
00:09:02,413 --> 00:09:04,252
It doesn't look like your information is up to date.

134
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:06,222
It doesn't matter what kind of drug we're talking about.

135
00:09:06,452 --> 00:09:09,222
I don't think that's what this room was made for.

136
00:09:09,293 --> 00:09:10,293
Then what?

137
00:09:10,653 --> 00:09:11,792
What do you think they used this space for?

138
00:09:11,793 --> 00:09:15,493
Well, this is a hospital. An operating room, I guess?

139
00:09:21,403 --> 00:09:23,932
Detective Lee, you're here again.

140
00:09:25,072 --> 00:09:27,072
Do you need help with something?

141
00:09:27,273 --> 00:09:30,673
Sir, spare me a moment.

142
00:09:30,842 --> 00:09:32,912
We're still investigating it, so we can't tell you everything.

143
00:09:32,913 --> 00:09:34,753
But please cooperate for the time being.

144
00:09:34,982 --> 00:09:39,182
Look. What's going on?

145
00:09:39,883 --> 00:09:42,191
Last time, I overheard you talking about Chairman Kim.

146
00:09:42,192 --> 00:09:43,722
Is it related to that person?

147
00:09:44,552 --> 00:09:47,192
Who is Chairman Kim?

148
00:09:48,533 --> 00:09:49,832
"Chairman Kim"?

149
00:09:54,602 --> 00:09:55,802
Darn it.

150
00:09:56,102 --> 00:09:58,071
Don't you know him? He's called Chairman Kim, the drug dealer.

151
00:09:58,072 --> 00:10:00,543
I have my hands on one of the lists that'll make money.

152
00:10:01,102 --> 00:10:03,673
If I sell it, I'll make a killing.

153
00:10:05,643 --> 00:10:06,942
Have you heard of the name?

154
00:10:08,812 --> 00:10:11,153
No, never.

155
00:10:12,383 --> 00:10:13,451
Who is this person?

156
00:10:13,452 --> 00:10:15,123
I can't tell you anything at the moment,

157
00:10:15,253 --> 00:10:17,052
so please pretend you heard nothing. Okay?

158
00:10:24,033 --> 00:10:26,033
Well, Detective Lee.

159
00:10:27,602 --> 00:10:28,673
If you need anything...

160
00:10:28,972 --> 00:10:31,332
You'll need my help, and I will cooperate.

161
00:10:31,743 --> 00:10:32,801
Please wrap it up quickly.

162
00:10:32,802 --> 00:10:34,543
Okay, sure.

163
00:10:42,852 --> 00:10:44,312
Wait, Ms. Oh!

164
00:10:45,923 --> 00:10:48,153
Oh, sir.

165
00:10:50,952 --> 00:10:52,592
Well, you see...

166
00:10:53,863 --> 00:10:55,862
We couldn't finish our conversation earlier.

167
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:58,133
You could've just called me.

168
00:10:58,232 --> 00:11:00,033
Then I can't see your face.

169
00:11:00,102 --> 00:11:01,832
You can video-call me.

170
00:11:02,533 --> 00:11:04,633
Well, may I... Give me your hand.

171
00:11:05,342 --> 00:11:06,503
Ms. Oh.

172
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,013
You know,

173
00:11:09,873 --> 00:11:12,543
we like each other. Right?

174
00:11:14,582 --> 00:11:15,712
Yes.

175
00:11:16,613 --> 00:11:18,452
I guess so.

176
00:11:20,253 --> 00:11:22,092
Then we're a couple now.

177
00:11:22,153 --> 00:11:23,452
Starting today, okay?

178
00:11:25,092 --> 00:11:26,222
Well...

179
00:11:27,523 --> 00:11:28,832
Can I...

180
00:11:28,893 --> 00:11:31,232
Can I take some time and think about it?

181
00:11:33,003 --> 00:11:35,972
Gosh, I'm sorry. I know I started it.

182
00:11:36,273 --> 00:11:38,003
No, don't be sorry.

183
00:11:38,743 --> 00:11:40,873
Okay, let's take it slow.

184
00:11:42,072 --> 00:11:43,342
I'll wait for your answer.

185
00:11:53,283 --> 00:11:54,482
Woo Ri, you're home.

186
00:11:55,493 --> 00:11:56,653
Grandma.

187
00:11:58,052 --> 00:12:01,493
- Where is the tide taking me? - What?

188
00:12:02,363 --> 00:12:04,363
Why do you keep talking about the tide?

189
00:12:10,302 --> 00:12:11,432
What?

190
00:12:12,873 --> 00:12:14,043
Sir.

191
00:12:15,373 --> 00:12:17,342
You're always the first one to arrive at every meeting.

192
00:12:18,283 --> 00:12:19,711
I bet you always sat in the first row...

193
00:12:19,712 --> 00:12:21,512
of the classroom back in school,

194
00:12:21,513 --> 00:12:23,452
right in front of your teacher. Like this.

195
00:12:24,052 --> 00:12:25,182
Yes.

196
00:12:25,883 --> 00:12:27,023
Oh, right.

197
00:12:28,952 --> 00:12:31,352
I don't have to call you "Ms. Oh" anymore, right?

198
00:12:32,393 --> 00:12:33,562
Sorry?

199
00:12:38,302 --> 00:12:41,132
I'll call you Woo Ri from now on.

200
00:12:41,133 --> 00:12:43,732
Because I like you.

201
00:12:48,812 --> 00:12:50,113
Okay.

202
00:12:52,712 --> 00:12:53,842
What?

203
00:12:56,653 --> 00:12:58,452
Who likes whom?

204
00:12:59,352 --> 00:13:00,622
Hey, Ma Ri.

205
00:13:00,623 --> 00:13:02,052
I misheard you just now, right?

206
00:13:03,153 --> 00:13:04,493
You like her?

207
00:13:06,562 --> 00:13:07,663
You like her?

208
00:13:09,192 --> 00:13:10,263
It's...

209
00:13:10,663 --> 00:13:11,903
You tell me.

210
00:13:12,503 --> 00:13:14,262
- Tell me! - Hey, Ma Ri.

211
00:13:14,263 --> 00:13:16,672
Let's talk outside. Come on.

212
00:13:16,673 --> 00:13:18,033
Come on. Let's go.

213
00:13:19,643 --> 00:13:20,842
Woo Ri and I...

214
00:13:22,043 --> 00:13:23,543
like each other.

215
00:13:26,212 --> 00:13:27,643
- I don't believe this. - Ma Ri.

216
00:13:29,413 --> 00:13:31,082
Don't say anything to Woo Ri.

217
00:13:31,383 --> 00:13:33,052
You have no right to.

218
00:13:33,452 --> 00:13:35,092
Do not even meet her. Do you understand?

219
00:13:36,192 --> 00:13:37,451
Don't make me repeat myself.

220
00:13:37,452 --> 00:13:38,663
I don't believe this.

221
00:13:41,293 --> 00:13:42,763
This has got to be a lie!

222
00:13:43,732 --> 00:13:45,702
You're lying, right?

223
00:13:46,602 --> 00:13:49,403
You're lying! This is a lie.

224
00:13:51,842 --> 00:13:52,972
You're lying.

225
00:13:53,472 --> 00:13:54,602
You're lying...

226
00:13:59,113 --> 00:14:00,342
Ma Ri.

227
00:14:01,043 --> 00:14:02,212
Ma Ri.

228
00:14:03,052 --> 00:14:04,383
Why did you go to the hospital?

229
00:14:05,123 --> 00:14:06,383
What's wrong with you?

230
00:14:08,623 --> 00:14:09,793
Mom.

231
00:14:10,023 --> 00:14:12,023
Raphael has another woman now.

232
00:14:13,293 --> 00:14:14,893
We can break them up.

233
00:14:16,393 --> 00:14:18,363
He's seeing the woman who's pregnant with his child.

234
00:14:19,863 --> 00:14:22,232
He is seeing Oh Woo Ri, the pregnant woman?

235
00:14:23,673 --> 00:14:26,072
Who knew the situation would take such a turn?

236
00:14:26,102 --> 00:14:27,273
Let's just give up.

237
00:14:28,173 --> 00:14:29,572
There's nothing we can do now.

238
00:14:30,312 --> 00:14:32,481
And I can't take this anymore.

239
00:14:32,482 --> 00:14:33,643
What are you talking about?

240
00:14:33,712 --> 00:14:37,012
Go pull her hair out and slap her in the face!

241
00:14:37,013 --> 00:14:38,822
I don't want to!

242
00:14:40,582 --> 00:14:42,622
There is a way.

243
00:14:42,623 --> 00:14:43,923
No, there isn't.

244
00:14:44,653 --> 00:14:46,692
Stop trying to force things.

245
00:14:48,062 --> 00:14:49,562
They'll break up...

246
00:14:50,163 --> 00:14:52,033
if the baby is gone, right?

247
00:14:54,133 --> 00:14:55,332
What do you mean?

248
00:14:55,832 --> 00:14:57,732
We just need the baby gone.

249
00:15:16,753 --> 00:15:20,692
(CEO Raphael)

250
00:15:25,663 --> 00:15:28,232
(Ms. Oh Woo Ri)

251
00:15:44,653 --> 00:15:46,352
So they're dating?

252
00:15:49,052 --> 00:15:50,222
It ended up happening.

253
00:15:50,293 --> 00:15:51,653
You won't just leave them be, right?

254
00:15:54,493 --> 00:15:55,633
I have no choice.

255
00:15:56,763 --> 00:15:58,133
I mean, what could I do now?

256
00:15:58,232 --> 00:16:01,533
Do you think they actually love each other?

257
00:16:01,873 --> 00:16:04,533
Clearly, they're just confused because of the baby.

258
00:16:05,442 --> 00:16:07,042
It won't work out.

259
00:16:07,043 --> 00:16:09,143
We should stop them, for their own sakes.

260
00:16:14,712 --> 00:16:16,052
Whatever she decides to do,

261
00:16:16,952 --> 00:16:18,212
I have no say in it.

262
00:16:19,552 --> 00:16:20,852
I'm busy. I have to go.

263
00:16:30,393 --> 00:16:31,562
I'm saying this just in case.

264
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:33,863
You'd better not stress her out.

265
00:16:48,082 --> 00:16:49,682
It has no color or smell.

266
00:16:50,182 --> 00:16:52,722
Put it in some kind of beverage and make her drink it.

267
00:16:54,423 --> 00:16:56,523
Thank you. This is so delicious.

268
00:16:56,716 --> 00:17:00,449
Just seeing you makes me so happy, Woo Ri.

269
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:04,125
It's only natural that you're happy to see your own daughter.

270
00:17:04,938 --> 00:17:06,038
He doesn't know yet, right?

271
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:07,738
The good news.

272
00:17:10,807 --> 00:17:12,038
What's going on?

273
00:17:12,337 --> 00:17:13,478
What happened?

274
00:17:13,945 --> 00:17:15,179
Tell me.

275
00:17:33,028 --> 00:17:34,258
I saw you...

276
00:17:34,959 --> 00:17:37,429
in the baby nursery with Raphael.

277
00:17:38,899 --> 00:17:40,798
That was the first time I wondered,

278
00:17:42,439 --> 00:17:44,439
"What's that woman doing in that room?"

279
00:17:45,639 --> 00:17:47,808
"I should be in that room with him."

280
00:17:53,848 --> 00:17:56,179
Try putting yourself in my shoes.

281
00:17:57,018 --> 00:17:59,619
You're pregnant with the child that I should be carrying...

282
00:17:59,889 --> 00:18:03,288
and even stole my husband from me. How do you think I feel?

283
00:18:04,488 --> 00:18:05,828
- Look. - Let's put things...

284
00:18:06,159 --> 00:18:07,459
back to where they should be.

285
00:18:08,058 --> 00:18:10,528
Us too. Let's go back to where we should be.

286
00:18:11,169 --> 00:18:13,328
You were engaged to Detective Lee Kang Jae.

287
00:18:13,869 --> 00:18:16,199
You shouldn't be with Raphael.

288
00:18:16,669 --> 00:18:19,409
You're just confused because of the baby.

289
00:18:21,078 --> 00:18:22,538
Why are you doing this to me?

290
00:18:23,479 --> 00:18:25,108
Don't do this to me, please!

291
00:18:25,109 --> 00:18:26,649
That's enough, please.

292
00:18:27,379 --> 00:18:30,277
It's not like I'm his mistress who ruined your marriage.

293
00:18:30,278 --> 00:18:32,288
I don't understand why I should be listening to this now.

294
00:18:32,518 --> 00:18:35,159
You don't have the right to tell me what to do.

295
00:18:35,659 --> 00:18:38,159
I'll do what I think is right and follow my heart.

296
00:18:39,689 --> 00:18:40,828
Okay.

297
00:18:41,258 --> 00:18:43,129
I'm sorry for everything.

298
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:44,729
Don't be mad.

299
00:18:45,129 --> 00:18:47,229
Let's talk it out, okay?

300
00:18:52,838 --> 00:18:54,879
I was going to hand the baby over to you.

301
00:18:55,109 --> 00:18:56,909
But you lied to me.

302
00:18:57,139 --> 00:18:58,909
I bet you never wanted the baby in the first place.

303
00:19:08,788 --> 00:19:09,919
Woo Ri.

304
00:19:13,129 --> 00:19:14,189
Raphael.

305
00:19:14,659 --> 00:19:16,229
What are you two doing here?

306
00:19:17,058 --> 00:19:19,399
Ma Ri, what are you two doing here?

307
00:19:20,369 --> 00:19:21,498
What?

308
00:19:21,998 --> 00:19:23,838
I had to talk to her about something.

309
00:19:31,548 --> 00:19:32,709
Ma Ri.

310
00:19:33,979 --> 00:19:36,679
I understand that you're upset.

311
00:19:36,818 --> 00:19:37,919
But as you know,

312
00:19:38,189 --> 00:19:39,889
Woo Ri is pregnant right now.

313
00:19:40,419 --> 00:19:42,788
Don't say anything that would make her uncomfortable.

314
00:19:42,889 --> 00:19:43,958
Just...

315
00:19:43,959 --> 00:19:45,188
talk to me.

316
00:19:45,189 --> 00:19:46,429
Please.

317
00:19:47,189 --> 00:19:49,528
For the baby's sake. Okay?

318
00:20:11,588 --> 00:20:12,848
What's wrong with you?

319
00:20:13,419 --> 00:20:16,119
What unruly behavior is this?

320
00:20:17,659 --> 00:20:19,288
Woo Ri, are you okay?

321
00:20:20,488 --> 00:20:21,698
Are you really going to be like this?

322
00:20:21,699 --> 00:20:22,929
Aren't you going to apologize?

323
00:20:32,109 --> 00:20:34,538
Woo Ri, are you okay? That must have surprised you.

324
00:20:36,209 --> 00:20:37,409
I'm sorry.

325
00:20:38,149 --> 00:20:39,209
No, it's okay.

326
00:20:40,748 --> 00:20:42,649
You don't need to apologize for this.

327
00:20:43,748 --> 00:20:45,389
But since I am...

328
00:20:48,189 --> 00:20:49,758
was Ma Ri's husband.

329
00:20:53,659 --> 00:20:55,528
There's a lot to consider.

330
00:20:56,699 --> 00:20:59,869
The people around us and the various situations.

331
00:21:03,169 --> 00:21:06,308
It would be nice if we only needed to think about ourselves.

332
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:21,119
How did it go? Did you give her the drug?

333
00:21:22,058 --> 00:21:23,258
I can't do it.

334
00:21:26,229 --> 00:21:27,288
Why?

335
00:21:27,899 --> 00:21:29,459
It's Raphael's baby.

336
00:21:31,998 --> 00:21:33,469
So what?

337
00:21:34,598 --> 00:21:38,508
Raphael can no longer have children.

338
00:21:40,768 --> 00:21:44,109
He looks dearly at the sonogram picture on his desk.

339
00:21:46,278 --> 00:21:49,848
Are you seriously in love with Raphael by any chance?

340
00:21:50,119 --> 00:21:51,419
I don't know.

341
00:21:53,149 --> 00:21:54,659
I don't like Oh Woo Ri...

342
00:21:56,058 --> 00:21:58,088
or how the baby got conceived.

343
00:21:59,389 --> 00:22:00,788
But if something goes wrong with the baby,

344
00:22:01,729 --> 00:22:03,758
I think Raphael would really have a hard time.

345
00:22:05,429 --> 00:22:08,998
You must be out of your mind now that you're comfortable.

346
00:22:09,268 --> 00:22:12,709
How can you prey on him if you really like him?

347
00:22:12,838 --> 00:22:14,008
Does that make sense?

348
00:22:14,939 --> 00:22:18,149
How can you act the landlord's part with such a weak heart?

349
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:22,219
Mom,

350
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:27,548
that baby...

351
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:36,729
could have been mine.

352
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:56,848
Hello, Mr. Choi.

353
00:22:57,219 --> 00:22:59,087
I heard you've been waiting. Is there something wrong?

354
00:22:59,088 --> 00:23:01,689
What's going on, Raphael?

355
00:23:02,018 --> 00:23:03,388
Excuse me?

356
00:23:03,389 --> 00:23:06,358
I heard that things worked out between you and Woo Ri.

357
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:08,699
Right. Yes, it happened that way.

358
00:23:10,729 --> 00:23:11,968
That's good news.

359
00:23:11,969 --> 00:23:15,838
I trusted and liked you from the beginning.

360
00:23:15,969 --> 00:23:20,368
It would be better if you get along and become a family.

361
00:23:20,369 --> 00:23:23,209
Well, we need to take things slow.

362
00:23:24,439 --> 00:23:26,909
- What's all this about? - You came.

363
00:23:27,278 --> 00:23:29,078
Well, Father...

364
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:33,418
You and the baby's mother are getting along well together?

365
00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:35,758
That's correct, Mr. Kim. We're in-laws.

366
00:23:36,219 --> 00:23:37,258
In-laws?

367
00:23:38,729 --> 00:23:40,389
You...

368
00:23:43,929 --> 00:23:46,929
My son finally made it.

369
00:23:47,298 --> 00:23:49,899
You had a plan all along.

370
00:23:50,298 --> 00:23:52,408
Well, it's not like I had a plan.

371
00:23:52,409 --> 00:23:55,037
- You'll get married, right? - It's not like that.

372
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:57,978
Why don't we all gather to have a meal together first?

373
00:23:57,979 --> 00:24:00,479
That's a great idea. Call her right away.

374
00:24:00,578 --> 00:24:02,718
I want to take a look at her carefully again.

375
00:24:02,719 --> 00:24:05,518
Relax, the both of you.

376
00:24:06,149 --> 00:24:08,158
We only found out we have feelings for each other.

377
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,318
Things are still very cautious for both of us.

378
00:24:10,389 --> 00:24:12,188
So please wait a bit longer.

379
00:24:12,189 --> 00:24:14,859
Of course. But promise you'll do it.

380
00:24:15,498 --> 00:24:19,327
Gosh, you. You take after me.

381
00:24:19,328 --> 00:24:21,838
Well, I don't know about taking after you.

382
00:24:22,939 --> 00:24:24,338
I'm home.

383
00:24:25,369 --> 00:24:26,908
Gosh, that's good news.

384
00:24:26,909 --> 00:24:29,638
Thank you, Lord.

385
00:24:29,639 --> 00:24:31,338
Are you really dating Raphael?

386
00:24:31,578 --> 00:24:33,008
Seoung Il told me about it.

387
00:24:33,308 --> 00:24:35,218
Gosh, Ye Ri.

388
00:24:35,219 --> 00:24:36,777
Are you really dating him? Why?

389
00:24:36,778 --> 00:24:38,047
What do you mean why?

390
00:24:38,048 --> 00:24:40,688
What more is there for a young man and woman liking each other?

391
00:24:40,689 --> 00:24:43,658
We just found out that we have feelings for each other.

392
00:24:43,659 --> 00:24:44,958
We're nothing yet.

393
00:24:44,959 --> 00:24:47,188
That's good. That's right.

394
00:24:47,189 --> 00:24:49,358
That's how you start things.

395
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:51,868
That's how you get married.

396
00:24:51,869 --> 00:24:52,969
Mom.

397
00:24:54,028 --> 00:24:55,838
Do you really have feelings for him?

398
00:24:56,338 --> 00:24:58,268
Just because he's the father of the baby?

399
00:24:58,508 --> 00:24:59,938
Didn't you make that decision because of the baby?

400
00:24:59,939 --> 00:25:01,237
What do you mean?

401
00:25:01,238 --> 00:25:03,408
Isn't that better for the baby?

402
00:25:03,409 --> 00:25:06,148
Mom, you shouldn't pressure her into this.

403
00:25:06,149 --> 00:25:08,578
No, I'm not pressured into anything.

404
00:25:08,719 --> 00:25:09,979
It's my feelings.

405
00:25:10,518 --> 00:25:12,619
I'm going to be honest about my feelings.

406
00:25:12,689 --> 00:25:14,119
Yes, that's good.

407
00:25:14,348 --> 00:25:15,918
Why are you being this way,

408
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:17,189
when you should be congratulating her?

409
00:25:17,859 --> 00:25:19,088
Then what about Kang Jae?

410
00:25:21,028 --> 00:25:24,028
Are you really done with Kang Jae? Are you really going to end it?

411
00:25:24,328 --> 00:25:25,469
Does he know about this as well?

412
00:25:30,399 --> 00:25:31,469
I...

413
00:25:32,508 --> 00:25:34,568
I will tell him myself.

414
00:25:37,209 --> 00:25:39,909
Kang Jae, I can't find anything.

415
00:25:40,508 --> 00:25:43,048
There is no one that did the drugs Chairman Kim distributed.

416
00:25:44,078 --> 00:25:45,788
We need to look into it a bit more.

417
00:25:46,719 --> 00:25:48,048
It definitely is Chairman Kim.

418
00:25:48,859 --> 00:25:51,758
We found the secret space with related leads on Chairman Kim.

419
00:25:51,988 --> 00:25:53,359
We looked everywhere.

420
00:25:53,588 --> 00:25:56,558
We even contacted a retired drug manufacturer and still nothing.

421
00:25:57,098 --> 00:25:59,328
I don't think this is about drugs.

422
00:26:02,699 --> 00:26:04,139
Are you the singer for the day?

423
00:26:04,399 --> 00:26:05,538
Hello.

424
00:26:06,469 --> 00:26:07,938
I'm singer Oh Eun Ran.

425
00:26:07,939 --> 00:26:09,737
- You're late. - She says she's a singer.

426
00:26:09,738 --> 00:26:11,037
I'll get ready soon.

427
00:26:11,038 --> 00:26:13,348
I need to change and get the stage ready.

428
00:26:13,409 --> 00:26:14,449
Where can I do it?

429
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:21,219
Gosh.

430
00:26:28,798 --> 00:26:31,598
(Entrance to Women's Bath)

431
00:26:32,028 --> 00:26:33,368
- Ms. Oh Eun ran. - Yes?

432
00:26:33,369 --> 00:26:34,699
This way.

433
00:26:35,139 --> 00:26:37,139
Right. Thank you.

434
00:26:40,869 --> 00:26:43,838
- Just a second. Excuse me. - Oh gosh.

435
00:26:44,209 --> 00:26:47,149
- They must be her bodyguards. - What is that?

436
00:26:47,479 --> 00:26:50,179
- She must be some special singer. - Is that so?

437
00:26:50,449 --> 00:26:53,787
I'm not familiar with trot singers, but she must be famous.

438
00:26:53,788 --> 00:26:55,689
She must be a great singer.

439
00:26:56,189 --> 00:26:58,287
- Let's see how she does. - I wonder if she's any good.

440
00:26:58,288 --> 00:27:00,588
- Is she? - She must be a celebrity.

441
00:27:00,689 --> 00:27:03,298
- I think she is. - I think I'm right.

442
00:27:08,838 --> 00:27:10,238
Hello, everyone.

443
00:27:10,439 --> 00:27:13,938
I'm here today to congratulate the opening of Romance Sauna.

444
00:27:13,939 --> 00:27:16,838
I'm singer Oh Eun Ran. It's nice to see you all.

445
00:27:19,748 --> 00:27:22,179
- Eun Ran. - Gosh, Hyung Sik.

446
00:27:22,248 --> 00:27:25,788
I was so surprised. You should've told me earlier.

447
00:27:25,818 --> 00:27:27,419
I came to surprise you on purpose.

448
00:27:27,988 --> 00:27:29,188
Ms. Oh Eun Ran.

449
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:30,918
(Romance Health Jade Sauna)

450
00:27:30,919 --> 00:27:33,959
Your singing was great today.

451
00:27:34,288 --> 00:27:37,998
It's an honor to have you at our opening today.

452
00:27:39,169 --> 00:27:42,098
- Thank you for having me. - Thank you.

453
00:27:43,969 --> 00:27:46,168
- Eun Ran! - Eun Ran!

454
00:27:46,169 --> 00:27:47,909
We love you.

455
00:28:12,929 --> 00:28:15,169
What's wrong, Gwi Nyeo?

456
00:28:15,969 --> 00:28:18,368
It's nothing, why did you come out?

457
00:28:18,369 --> 00:28:19,409
You should watch the movie.

458
00:28:20,109 --> 00:28:22,308
Are you crying? Why?

459
00:28:23,409 --> 00:28:27,149
I just feel bad about the time passing.

460
00:28:27,379 --> 00:28:29,179
What do you mean by that all of a sudden?

461
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:32,348
I watched this movie when I was young.

462
00:28:33,288 --> 00:28:36,688
I thought I'd visit Europe...

463
00:28:36,689 --> 00:28:40,058
and meet a great guy watching the movie.

464
00:28:41,588 --> 00:28:43,899
Audrey Hepburn in the movie is still the same.

465
00:28:44,598 --> 00:28:48,028
But why have I turned into an old lady?

466
00:28:49,738 --> 00:28:53,109
Such a thought made me tear up suddenly.

467
00:28:53,338 --> 00:28:56,738
You're still a girl in my eyes, Gwi Nyeo.

468
00:28:57,838 --> 00:28:59,409
- Let's go. - What?

469
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,179
- Gwi Nyeo! - Yes?

470
00:29:04,278 --> 00:29:06,119
Let's go.

471
00:29:12,058 --> 00:29:13,659
That man sounds great.

472
00:29:14,229 --> 00:29:16,558
I was deeply touched today.

473
00:29:17,528 --> 00:29:20,268
By the way, isn't sending bodyguards great as well?

474
00:29:20,598 --> 00:29:22,639
Why did I only meet such a guy now?

475
00:29:23,199 --> 00:29:25,208
Me too, why did I only meet him now?

476
00:29:25,209 --> 00:29:28,508
It would have been better if I met him when I was younger.

477
00:29:29,109 --> 00:29:31,238
You should be grateful that you met him now.

478
00:29:31,308 --> 00:29:34,007
There are many who don't get to meet their love until they die.

479
00:29:34,008 --> 00:29:37,778
Eun Ran, would you like to meet him?

480
00:29:38,248 --> 00:29:40,188
Really? Do you want to introduce him to me?

481
00:29:40,189 --> 00:29:41,758
Yes, I want to meet him.

482
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:44,388
Mom, would you like to meet Hyung Sik?

483
00:29:44,389 --> 00:29:46,689
- He's such a great guy. - Me?

484
00:29:46,788 --> 00:29:50,359
Wait, should all four of us meet together?

485
00:29:50,558 --> 00:29:53,528
- All four of us? - Yes, a double date.

486
00:29:57,869 --> 00:29:59,369
Yes, that sounds great.

487
00:30:04,109 --> 00:30:05,679
Hello, I'm with the police.

488
00:30:05,949 --> 00:30:07,577
Do you know anyone who built...

489
00:30:07,578 --> 00:30:09,619
Diamond Plastic Surgery in Gangnam a few years ago?

490
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:11,748
Do you know someone who built Diamond Plastic Surgery?

491
00:30:12,189 --> 00:30:13,448
- No. - You don't know?

492
00:30:13,449 --> 00:30:14,488
I don't know.

493
00:30:16,518 --> 00:30:17,588
Detective.

494
00:30:18,318 --> 00:30:20,057
Were looking for someone who built Diamond Plastic Surgery?

495
00:30:20,058 --> 00:30:21,058
Yes.

496
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:22,558
There's a Mr. Choi who sells construction materials.

497
00:30:23,129 --> 00:30:25,268
He bought a new car after the construction.

498
00:30:25,298 --> 00:30:26,469
Is anyone there?

499
00:30:26,929 --> 00:30:28,098
Hello?

500
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:47,889
(Order list)

501
00:30:53,488 --> 00:30:54,588
Kang Jae, are you all right?

502
00:30:57,959 --> 00:30:58,968
Who attacked me?

503
00:30:58,969 --> 00:31:01,669
The owner of the store of course.

504
00:31:01,838 --> 00:31:04,399
He was on alert since he kept getting robbed.

505
00:31:04,538 --> 00:31:06,468
He called the police saying that he caught the thief.

506
00:31:06,469 --> 00:31:08,308
I think he was involved in the hospital construction.

507
00:31:08,439 --> 00:31:10,479
- We need to investigate it. - I'll look into it.

508
00:31:12,449 --> 00:31:13,649
Kang Jae,

509
00:31:14,778 --> 00:31:15,979
I was worried,

510
00:31:16,379 --> 00:31:17,778
thinking you might get hurt doing this.

511
00:31:18,488 --> 00:31:19,919
I was really scared.

512
00:31:21,318 --> 00:31:23,689
What if something happens when I'm not with you?

513
00:31:25,389 --> 00:31:26,888
I was afraid.

514
00:31:26,889 --> 00:31:29,028
Don't worry about me.

515
00:31:44,879 --> 00:31:46,008
Are you okay?

516
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:48,209
Yes.

517
00:31:49,078 --> 00:31:50,379
I'm fine.

518
00:31:51,748 --> 00:31:52,888
What brings you here?

519
00:31:52,889 --> 00:31:54,689
The emergency contact network for immediate family members.

520
00:31:55,788 --> 00:31:58,359
My number was written there.

521
00:32:00,459 --> 00:32:01,828
I'm sorry.

522
00:32:02,098 --> 00:32:03,629
I haven't changed it yet. I'm sorry.

523
00:32:05,399 --> 00:32:06,828
You need to be careful.

524
00:32:07,369 --> 00:32:08,798
And don't get hurt.

525
00:32:09,139 --> 00:32:10,199
Right.

526
00:32:11,199 --> 00:32:12,308
I should.

527
00:32:13,508 --> 00:32:14,669
How about you?

528
00:32:15,409 --> 00:32:16,738
How are things with you?

529
00:32:16,979 --> 00:32:18,139
I'm good.

530
00:32:20,048 --> 00:32:21,109
Good.

531
00:32:23,548 --> 00:32:25,078
- Kang Jae. - Yes?

532
00:32:25,848 --> 00:32:27,848
I had something to tell you when I met you.

533
00:32:33,889 --> 00:32:35,298
Today's not a good day.

534
00:32:37,028 --> 00:32:38,229
Next time.

535
00:32:39,068 --> 00:32:40,268
I'll tell you next time.

536
00:32:43,699 --> 00:32:45,038
Take care of yourself.

537
00:32:45,639 --> 00:32:46,808
And don't get hurt.

538
00:32:47,969 --> 00:32:49,078
I'll get going.

539
00:32:54,508 --> 00:32:55,679
Woo Ri.

540
00:33:09,058 --> 00:33:11,729
I only have one thing I can do for you now.

541
00:33:13,498 --> 00:33:15,838
To pray that you are happy.

542
00:33:18,268 --> 00:33:19,808
Don't worry about me...

543
00:33:21,308 --> 00:33:22,738
and if you have someone you like,

544
00:33:25,649 --> 00:33:26,879
date him as you wish.

545
00:33:48,899 --> 00:33:50,267
Ms. Yu.

546
00:33:50,268 --> 00:33:52,538
Let's go out. Let's go and enjoy the fresh air.

547
00:33:52,768 --> 00:33:54,067
What? Where are we going?

548
00:33:54,068 --> 00:33:56,208
The film crew. They're shooting at a resort in Gangwon-do Province.

549
00:33:56,209 --> 00:33:58,708
They are giving us a room as well. Let's work there.

550
00:33:58,709 --> 00:34:00,609
Suddenly? I have nothing on me.

551
00:34:00,679 --> 00:34:02,878
It's not like we're going abroad. It's just for the night.

552
00:34:02,879 --> 00:34:05,347
They even sell underwear at convenience stores these days.

553
00:34:05,348 --> 00:34:07,488
We only need to be there.

554
00:34:07,489 --> 00:34:10,258
Isn't this your luggage?

555
00:34:10,259 --> 00:34:11,657
I just have a few simple things.

556
00:34:11,658 --> 00:34:12,827
Let's go.

557
00:34:12,828 --> 00:34:14,358
The production crew is coming to get us.

558
00:34:14,359 --> 00:34:15,798
Go!

559
00:34:15,799 --> 00:34:18,669
Quick.

560
00:34:28,678 --> 00:34:29,838
What are you thinking?

561
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:31,709
Let's go, quick.

562
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:34,178
Where are we going?

563
00:34:34,348 --> 00:34:35,677
It's been so long.

564
00:34:35,678 --> 00:34:38,918
It's been so long. This is so nice.

565
00:34:38,919 --> 00:34:40,287
Let's take a picture.

566
00:34:40,288 --> 00:34:41,649
One, two, three.

567
00:34:44,888 --> 00:34:46,458
This is awesome.

568
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:47,759
Wait.

569
00:34:48,529 --> 00:34:49,728
Wait.

570
00:34:49,729 --> 00:34:52,828
Woo Ri. Hold my hand.

571
00:34:54,928 --> 00:34:57,367
Woo Ri, drink this water and live a long life.

572
00:34:57,368 --> 00:34:58,709
- Cheers. - Cheers.

573
00:35:01,638 --> 00:35:03,908
This was refreshing thanks to you, Ms. Yu.

574
00:35:05,808 --> 00:35:07,149
Shall we go now?

575
00:35:07,178 --> 00:35:08,348
We need to work as well.

576
00:35:08,748 --> 00:35:11,117
Woo Ri, since we're in Gangwon, let's go see the sea.

577
00:35:11,118 --> 00:35:12,717
It's not far from here. It's close.

578
00:35:12,718 --> 00:35:14,448
What? What about work?

579
00:35:14,989 --> 00:35:17,759
Let's pass that on to tomorrow's Ye Ri and Woo Ri.

580
00:35:17,859 --> 00:35:18,888
- Let's go. - Gosh.

581
00:35:19,189 --> 00:35:20,629
- Move it. - Gosh.

582
00:35:25,001 --> 00:35:27,671
Ms. Yu, where are you? Why aren't you coming?

583
00:35:27,742 --> 00:35:30,971
Woo Ri, enjoy some time on your own.

584
00:35:30,972 --> 00:35:32,811
I'm going to spend some time on my own as well.

585
00:35:34,582 --> 00:35:37,411
- Are you taking a dump? - No. I ran into someone here.

586
00:35:37,412 --> 00:35:39,352
So be on your own for a while. Bye.

587
00:35:40,421 --> 00:35:41,582
What was that?

588
00:36:16,691 --> 00:36:17,951
It is you.

589
00:36:17,952 --> 00:36:19,391
I wondered if it was you.

590
00:36:19,392 --> 00:36:20,761
What are you doing here?

591
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:22,162
I was just passing by.

592
00:36:26,532 --> 00:36:29,531
I was passing and saw a yellow dot.

593
00:36:29,532 --> 00:36:30,971
The yellow dot...

594
00:36:30,972 --> 00:36:33,372
The yellow dot looked strangely pretty.

595
00:36:34,072 --> 00:36:36,241
You're here for work.

596
00:36:36,242 --> 00:36:37,311
Aren't you busy?

597
00:36:37,872 --> 00:36:40,182
I only need to go to a meeting in the evening.

598
00:36:40,742 --> 00:36:42,881
I still have a lot of time. What about you, Woo Ri?

599
00:36:43,552 --> 00:36:45,651
Ms. Yu said we should work here,

600
00:36:46,082 --> 00:36:47,481
and suddenly she's meeting someone.

601
00:36:48,052 --> 00:36:49,782
So I've decided to take a day off today.

602
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:51,552
Is that so?

603
00:36:52,021 --> 00:36:55,621
It's amazing that we met here by coincidence,

604
00:36:55,622 --> 00:36:56,992
- isn't it? - It is.

605
00:36:59,461 --> 00:37:00,561
By the way,

606
00:37:00,861 --> 00:37:04,401
we met here once before.

607
00:37:05,771 --> 00:37:06,872
Yes.

608
00:37:07,541 --> 00:37:08,671
We did.

609
00:37:09,401 --> 00:37:11,742
It amazed me when I found out by chance...

610
00:37:11,811 --> 00:37:13,541
that I met you here.

611
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:15,981
It's strange. Relationships.

612
00:37:17,452 --> 00:37:19,012
It was my first kiss.

613
00:37:19,211 --> 00:37:20,380
What?

614
00:37:20,381 --> 00:37:21,881
Why? Then?

615
00:37:24,552 --> 00:37:26,860
Your first kiss came quite late for you.

616
00:37:26,861 --> 00:37:29,221
No, wait. Is that average?

617
00:37:29,222 --> 00:37:32,190
You said you wanted to meet again the next day.

618
00:37:32,191 --> 00:37:33,302
Yes.

619
00:37:33,802 --> 00:37:34,932
I did.

620
00:37:35,262 --> 00:37:37,802
But why didn't we meet?

621
00:37:37,872 --> 00:37:39,900
I was there the next day.

622
00:37:39,901 --> 00:37:41,642
But you were with another woman.

623
00:37:42,401 --> 00:37:43,512
Me?

624
00:37:44,441 --> 00:37:47,281
That must have been my relative.

625
00:37:47,282 --> 00:37:48,782
My cousin probably.

626
00:37:48,881 --> 00:37:50,012
You were kissing together.

627
00:37:50,881 --> 00:37:52,111
That wasn't my relative.

628
00:37:52,381 --> 00:37:53,651
And not my cousin.

629
00:37:54,251 --> 00:37:56,480
Well, that was...

630
00:37:56,481 --> 00:37:58,122
It's okay.

631
00:37:58,521 --> 00:37:59,892
Such a thing can happen.

632
00:38:00,021 --> 00:38:03,992
What if I told you that I met my ex-girlfriend by coincidence,

633
00:38:04,231 --> 00:38:07,400
found out that we still had feelings, got carried away,

634
00:38:07,401 --> 00:38:09,461
and forgot the promise I made with you?

635
00:38:10,332 --> 00:38:11,501
I wouldn't believe it.

636
00:38:12,001 --> 00:38:14,340
Look at the time.

637
00:38:14,341 --> 00:38:16,302
Didn't you say you have a lot of time?

638
00:38:23,611 --> 00:38:27,282
Back then, it wasn't long since I was back from the US.

639
00:38:29,222 --> 00:38:30,992
I was a bit like that.

640
00:38:32,552 --> 00:38:35,291
It's okay. It's all in the past.

641
00:38:35,791 --> 00:38:38,791
This space was built at No Man Chul's request.

642
00:38:39,832 --> 00:38:41,602
It's not like we can ask him since he's dead.

643
00:38:42,602 --> 00:38:44,230
That man who hit you...

644
00:38:44,231 --> 00:38:46,301
didn't seem to know anything more.

645
00:38:46,302 --> 00:38:48,972
We found nothing even after we found the construction guy.

646
00:38:51,041 --> 00:38:53,711
If Chairman Kim is hiding in Diamond Medical Foundation,

647
00:38:55,282 --> 00:38:57,552
what would he have done with such a space?

648
00:38:58,811 --> 00:39:02,322
What would a drug dealer do hiding in a hospital?

649
00:39:03,251 --> 00:39:04,452
Kang Jae.

650
00:39:05,492 --> 00:39:06,791
Kang Jae.

651
00:39:07,561 --> 00:39:09,262
You know that thing we were talking about before, the karaoke...

652
00:39:09,791 --> 00:39:11,631
- I mean this is... - What is this?

653
00:39:13,032 --> 00:39:14,661
You guys are strange.

654
00:39:14,662 --> 00:39:16,500
What? What's strange now?

655
00:39:16,501 --> 00:39:18,731
I'm a detective. If I say it's strange, it's strange.

656
00:39:19,432 --> 00:39:20,770
What are you doing behind my back?

657
00:39:20,771 --> 00:39:22,742
I told you it was nothing.

658
00:39:22,972 --> 00:39:24,072
Are you two...

659
00:39:26,242 --> 00:39:27,481
dating?

660
00:39:29,282 --> 00:39:30,412
You guys are dating, aren't you?

661
00:39:30,452 --> 00:39:31,552
That's not it.

662
00:39:31,811 --> 00:39:33,921
You really have no sense.

663
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:36,352
That's really strange.

664
00:39:36,952 --> 00:39:39,421
You need to go to the hospital in Incheon.

665
00:39:39,552 --> 00:39:41,460
A Chinese gangster got into trouble.

666
00:39:41,461 --> 00:39:44,561
We need to investigate whether it's related to the karaoke case.

667
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:47,231
Don't even mention it. It was so scary.

668
00:39:47,631 --> 00:39:48,762
He was stabbed in the stomach...

669
00:39:50,001 --> 00:39:51,701
He came in bleeding so much.

670
00:39:51,702 --> 00:39:55,541
- He ran away after the treatment? - Yes.

671
00:39:56,041 --> 00:39:57,871
He was Chinese.

672
00:39:57,872 --> 00:39:59,012
He couldn't speak Korean.

673
00:39:59,211 --> 00:40:02,141
Let's secure the CCTV and check his face first.

674
00:40:02,142 --> 00:40:04,251
You won't be able to see his face in the footage.

675
00:40:04,682 --> 00:40:06,150
- Why not? - He had plastic surgery...

676
00:40:06,151 --> 00:40:07,222
all over his face.

677
00:40:07,381 --> 00:40:10,051
His eyes, nose, and face shape too.

678
00:40:10,052 --> 00:40:12,021
He had bandages wrapped around his face.

679
00:40:12,091 --> 00:40:14,691
- Plastic surgery? - Right. And this.

680
00:40:17,432 --> 00:40:19,162
He left this behind.

681
00:40:21,131 --> 00:40:22,401
Look at that bag.

682
00:40:22,561 --> 00:40:24,631
If he's holding drugs, that's worth millions.

683
00:40:26,231 --> 00:40:28,501
It's the bag he was carrying that night.

684
00:40:33,142 --> 00:40:36,311
What? It looks like an overnight bag.

685
00:40:37,452 --> 00:40:38,552
Pumpkin juice?

686
00:40:38,852 --> 00:40:40,182
He must have drunk this for the swelling.

687
00:40:41,381 --> 00:40:42,650
Kang Jae.

688
00:40:42,651 --> 00:40:44,421
He really must have been here to get plastic surgery.

689
00:40:44,952 --> 00:40:46,822
This had nothing to do with drugs.

690
00:40:47,691 --> 00:40:49,591
Gosh. We were wrong.

691
00:40:51,691 --> 00:40:53,602
He had plastic surgery.

692
00:40:54,901 --> 00:40:57,501
But he couldn't get it done in a regular hospital.

693
00:40:58,401 --> 00:40:59,501
What?

694
00:41:03,001 --> 00:41:04,111
Na Hee.

695
00:41:05,541 --> 00:41:07,481
- I figured it out. - Figure what out?

696
00:41:08,142 --> 00:41:10,012
What Chairman Kim did at the hospital.

697
00:41:12,111 --> 00:41:13,182
I figured it out.

698
00:41:14,521 --> 00:41:18,492
Seriously. You really have a generous heart.

699
00:41:18,822 --> 00:41:21,921
I'm kind of petty, so I tend to hold onto these things.

700
00:41:22,662 --> 00:41:26,162
No. It's really okay. It's all in the past.

701
00:41:26,961 --> 00:41:30,032
You and I have both changed since that day.

702
00:41:32,401 --> 00:41:34,072
I'm elated right now.

703
00:41:34,771 --> 00:41:36,972
I think I will remember this moment for a long time.

704
00:41:37,311 --> 00:41:39,511
We met here by chance.

705
00:41:39,512 --> 00:41:41,242
And no one here knows about us.

706
00:41:42,111 --> 00:41:43,651
Just being here together.

707
00:41:45,782 --> 00:41:47,651
I had a lot on my mind too.

708
00:41:48,552 --> 00:41:50,052
But you're right.

709
00:41:50,892 --> 00:41:53,921
There won't be any problems when it's just the two of us.

710
00:41:55,392 --> 00:41:57,492
Woo Ri, do you want to come up to my room?

711
00:41:57,832 --> 00:41:59,892
We can have dinner together and talk all we want.

712
00:42:01,001 --> 00:42:02,032
Well...

713
00:42:03,332 --> 00:42:04,401
What is it?

714
00:42:05,432 --> 00:42:08,202
You asked me the same thing before.

715
00:42:09,341 --> 00:42:10,611
I did?

716
00:42:11,341 --> 00:42:15,242
But I decided to wait until marriage.

717
00:42:16,082 --> 00:42:17,552
So we should talk outside.

718
00:42:18,611 --> 00:42:20,251
Wait, what?

719
00:42:20,381 --> 00:42:21,751
I'll abstain until marriage.

720
00:42:25,892 --> 00:42:27,222
You didn't know that?

721
00:42:29,492 --> 00:42:31,261
Then you ended up getting pregnant...

722
00:42:31,262 --> 00:42:33,091
when you had been waiting until marriage?

723
00:42:35,602 --> 00:42:37,302
You didn't know.

724
00:42:39,102 --> 00:42:41,001
I didn't know.

725
00:42:55,881 --> 00:42:57,291
Hey, what is this place?

726
00:43:00,892 --> 00:43:02,921
You found this secret place?

727
00:43:03,322 --> 00:43:04,531
Why didn't you report this to me?

728
00:43:04,532 --> 00:43:06,290
There was no point. The only violation I could find...

729
00:43:06,291 --> 00:43:07,901
was an illegal expansion of the building.

730
00:43:08,102 --> 00:43:09,931
- Then what? - We've been following a man...

731
00:43:09,932 --> 00:43:11,631
who illegally entered Korea through a shipping container.

732
00:43:11,972 --> 00:43:13,270
This is where we lost him.

733
00:43:13,271 --> 00:43:16,602
But that guy gave us a clue on what Chairman Kim...

734
00:43:17,072 --> 00:43:18,311
had been up to.

735
00:43:18,742 --> 00:43:19,841
Na Hee.

736
00:43:22,481 --> 00:43:23,552
Gosh.

737
00:43:26,552 --> 00:43:27,822
What's this?

738
00:43:28,921 --> 00:43:30,952
Hey, is this a hideout for a serial killer?

739
00:43:31,091 --> 00:43:32,822
He got plastic surgery here.

740
00:43:33,822 --> 00:43:34,921
What's this?

741
00:43:38,691 --> 00:43:41,801
What? This guy just wanted to look handsome?

742
00:43:41,802 --> 00:43:43,401
We won't be able to find him now...

743
00:43:43,602 --> 00:43:45,472
because we don't know what he looks like now.

744
00:43:46,171 --> 00:43:48,840
Chairman Kim stopped selling drugs over the past two years...

745
00:43:48,841 --> 00:43:50,541
and has been running a new business.

746
00:43:50,972 --> 00:43:53,881
He's been fixing up the faces of these criminals.

747
00:43:54,282 --> 00:43:57,351
Change their faces? To assume a new identity?

748
00:43:57,352 --> 00:44:00,481
His clients must be criminals who would be in jail for decades.

749
00:44:01,651 --> 00:44:02,952
Hold on a second.

750
00:44:04,052 --> 00:44:06,751
So he changed their faces and gave them a place to hide?

751
00:44:06,892 --> 00:44:09,891
He must be raking in a lot of money from the sound of it.

752
00:44:09,892 --> 00:44:13,032
Chairman Kim found another business that pays better than drugs.

753
00:44:13,191 --> 00:44:16,231
But how can we be certain Chairman Kim is involved?

754
00:44:17,271 --> 00:44:18,900
We don't know how these criminals look now,

755
00:44:18,901 --> 00:44:19,901
so we can't catch them.

756
00:44:20,441 --> 00:44:21,641
I bet it was more than just the faces.

757
00:44:21,642 --> 00:44:23,642
They probably got new identities and went into hiding.

758
00:44:26,242 --> 00:44:29,811
I'm sure there's a list that shows their before and after photos.

759
00:44:30,381 --> 00:44:32,750
Captain, some of the felons...

760
00:44:32,751 --> 00:44:34,722
vanished into thin air.

761
00:44:35,282 --> 00:44:37,091
This is a chance to round up all of them.

762
00:44:37,421 --> 00:44:39,991
Right. But where is the list?

763
00:44:39,992 --> 00:44:42,360
We must have solid evidence.

764
00:44:42,361 --> 00:44:43,560
The chairman complained to the higher-ups...

765
00:44:43,561 --> 00:44:44,892
about our investigation.

766
00:44:45,061 --> 00:44:46,291
So they've been on my back.

767
00:44:47,432 --> 00:44:48,702
The list...

768
00:44:51,432 --> 00:44:53,032
We'll find evidence no matter what.

769
00:45:00,242 --> 00:45:01,912
You have a message.

770
00:45:04,352 --> 00:45:06,880
(They started to look for the list you talked about.)

771
00:45:06,881 --> 00:45:09,322
(If they find it, I'll take it. Prepare 500,000 dollars in cash.)

772
00:45:11,052 --> 00:45:13,691
(If they find it, I'll take it. Prepare 500,000 dollars in cash.)

773
00:45:23,501 --> 00:45:24,532
Okay.

774
00:45:25,032 --> 00:45:27,202
We should go.

775
00:45:34,782 --> 00:45:35,841
Woo Ri.

776
00:45:36,182 --> 00:45:39,912
I'm sorry.

777
00:45:41,222 --> 00:45:44,251
Running into you at the beach was nice.

778
00:45:45,552 --> 00:45:46,691
But...

779
00:45:48,061 --> 00:45:49,891
just like our first meeting,

780
00:45:49,892 --> 00:45:52,061
we ended up getting reminded of my mistake.

781
00:45:52,392 --> 00:45:54,262
Gosh. That's awful.

782
00:45:55,901 --> 00:45:59,271
You don't have to feel that way. I told you I was fine.

783
00:46:00,541 --> 00:46:03,401
My decision to abstain made you uncomfortable, right?

784
00:46:04,111 --> 00:46:07,941
No. This isn't about that at all.

785
00:46:08,142 --> 00:46:11,552
Woo Ri, you are a lot more understanding...

786
00:46:12,052 --> 00:46:14,082
than I thought.

787
00:46:14,552 --> 00:46:15,920
You were waiting until you got married...

788
00:46:15,921 --> 00:46:17,520
but accidentally got pregnant.

789
00:46:17,521 --> 00:46:18,691
Despite that,

790
00:46:19,552 --> 00:46:21,892
you decided to have the baby.

791
00:46:23,021 --> 00:46:26,032
I felt like I didn't deserve to like you.

792
00:46:26,532 --> 00:46:27,631
Gosh.

793
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:30,971
That means you're uncomfortable.

794
00:46:30,972 --> 00:46:32,271
No.

795
00:46:32,671 --> 00:46:35,340
In that logic, you must be more uncomfortable.

796
00:46:35,341 --> 00:46:38,741
I was a total player.

797
00:46:38,742 --> 00:46:39,841
And now,

798
00:46:40,841 --> 00:46:42,611
I'm divorced.

799
00:46:47,222 --> 00:46:49,021
You should go inside. It's getting cold.

800
00:46:49,822 --> 00:46:51,151
Gosh. Right.

801
00:46:52,091 --> 00:46:54,021
Here. Take this.

802
00:46:57,691 --> 00:46:59,032
What's this?

803
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:04,671
- A letter? - Gosh, no. It's like a memo.

804
00:47:05,432 --> 00:47:06,432
That's it.

805
00:47:07,771 --> 00:47:09,742
You should go inside. And sleep tight.

806
00:47:10,041 --> 00:47:11,941
It's cold. Gosh, it's freezing.

807
00:47:31,662 --> 00:47:33,190
When I'm with you,

808
00:47:33,191 --> 00:47:36,702
you make me strive to become a better person.

809
00:47:38,131 --> 00:47:42,341
You and the baby help me be a better man.

810
00:47:43,441 --> 00:47:44,841
I'd like to thank you from the bottom of my heart.

811
00:48:01,392 --> 00:48:02,762
By the way,

812
00:48:02,892 --> 00:48:06,832
this is my first time introducing my boyfriend to my mom.

813
00:48:07,162 --> 00:48:09,032
I see.

814
00:48:10,432 --> 00:48:13,901
I also thought about what this meeting would mean.

815
00:48:14,202 --> 00:48:18,012
But it didn't matter if this meeting was casual or serious.

816
00:48:18,271 --> 00:48:19,472
I'm fine with whatever happens.

817
00:48:20,941 --> 00:48:22,711
- Hyung Sik. - Yes.

818
00:48:24,012 --> 00:48:26,311
You have very long eyelashes.

819
00:48:44,032 --> 00:48:45,332
Dad.

820
00:48:45,731 --> 00:48:46,872
"Dad"?

821
00:48:47,171 --> 00:48:49,671
Mom. Is this...

822
00:48:49,872 --> 00:48:50,941
"Mom"?

823
00:48:52,372 --> 00:48:53,742
Is he your son?

824
00:48:54,512 --> 00:48:55,642
Is she your daughter?

825
00:48:56,412 --> 00:48:58,211
The woman you are seeing...

826
00:48:58,311 --> 00:49:01,452
Mom. You've been seeing Hyung Sik's father?

827
00:49:08,921 --> 00:49:10,561
Were you guys kissing just now?

828
00:49:11,091 --> 00:49:14,131
Mom! That's not important right now.

829
00:49:17,901 --> 00:49:20,571
Come with us, Ms. Yu.

830
00:49:20,572 --> 00:49:23,540
I said no. Why don't you two just go together?

831
00:49:23,541 --> 00:49:25,270
Just join us.

832
00:49:25,271 --> 00:49:28,741
Hey, there are only two seats. Should I sit on your lap?

833
00:49:28,742 --> 00:49:32,011
I should have brought a bigger car. I'm sorry.

834
00:49:32,012 --> 00:49:34,081
Gosh. Don't apologize. I'm fine.

835
00:49:34,082 --> 00:49:36,381
She can be dull at times. Goodness.

836
00:49:36,452 --> 00:49:38,690
- Bye! - Ms. Yu!

837
00:49:38,691 --> 00:49:39,722
Gosh.

838
00:49:40,552 --> 00:49:42,861
Goodness. She's so fast.

839
00:49:43,791 --> 00:49:46,791
(Seo Gwi Nyeo's Pork Cutlet)

840
00:49:51,872 --> 00:49:53,400
Thank you for the ride.

841
00:49:53,401 --> 00:49:54,771
I should thank you.

842
00:49:54,841 --> 00:49:57,611
We had a chance to talk on our way here. I liked it.

843
00:50:02,711 --> 00:50:05,352
(Hello. Congratulations on winning the EMS Children's story contest. )

844
00:50:08,222 --> 00:50:10,722
Woo Ri. What is it?

845
00:50:11,392 --> 00:50:12,452
What's going on?

846
00:50:12,722 --> 00:50:14,091
What is it?

847
00:50:14,822 --> 00:50:16,722
Mine got picked.

848
00:50:17,262 --> 00:50:18,491
Pardon? What?

849
00:50:18,492 --> 00:50:20,060
I applied to a children's story contest.

850
00:50:20,061 --> 00:50:21,361
And mine got chosen.

851
00:50:21,532 --> 00:50:22,662
Really?

852
00:50:22,731 --> 00:50:24,372
Congratulations! That's great news.

853
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:25,872
Gosh.

854
00:50:26,631 --> 00:50:28,671
It's not a big contest.

855
00:50:29,702 --> 00:50:30,972
I was lucky.

856
00:50:32,872 --> 00:50:34,481
Woo Ri,

857
00:50:34,941 --> 00:50:36,341
why do you think you got lucky?

858
00:50:37,381 --> 00:50:38,451
Pardon?

859
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:40,182
You won that with your hard work.

860
00:50:41,021 --> 00:50:43,751
You might think everything that happened might be out of luck.

861
00:50:44,191 --> 00:50:47,091
But maybe, all of your hard work...

862
00:50:48,162 --> 00:50:49,921
brought you good results.

863
00:50:51,832 --> 00:50:53,892
- Ms. Lee. I need your approval. - Later.

864
00:50:54,861 --> 00:50:56,802
Come on. Move!

865
00:51:06,771 --> 00:51:07,881
Woo Ri.

866
00:51:10,711 --> 00:51:11,750
Raphael.

867
00:51:11,751 --> 00:51:13,481
So you'll film in Gangwon Province.

868
00:51:13,711 --> 00:51:15,381
Are the writers joining you there?

869
00:51:15,452 --> 00:51:17,282
The writers work in their studio.

870
00:51:17,521 --> 00:51:19,750
But if you get them a room there,

871
00:51:19,751 --> 00:51:21,361
can't they work in the room?

872
00:51:21,492 --> 00:51:22,791
They can get some fresh air too.

873
00:51:24,532 --> 00:51:25,590
Are you taking a dump?

874
00:51:25,591 --> 00:51:27,400
No. I ran into someone here.

875
00:51:27,401 --> 00:51:29,662
So be on your own for a while. Bye.

876
00:51:31,072 --> 00:51:32,432
You can go to her now.

877
00:51:40,271 --> 00:51:41,710
Congratulations, Woo Ri.

878
00:51:41,711 --> 00:51:42,941
Go in and get some rest.

879
00:51:44,182 --> 00:51:46,311
Thank you. Bye.

880
00:51:57,061 --> 00:51:58,432
Raphael.

881
00:52:23,782 --> 00:52:24,921
Wait.

882
00:52:29,021 --> 00:52:30,621
What?

883
00:52:30,622 --> 00:52:31,861
Gosh. That was my chance.

884
00:52:34,561 --> 00:52:37,231
Everything that's happening to me now...

885
00:52:37,631 --> 00:52:39,332
feels surreal to me.

886
00:52:40,602 --> 00:52:42,671
After time passes by,

887
00:52:43,072 --> 00:52:45,171
when I'm old and gray,

888
00:52:46,472 --> 00:52:48,981
I hope reminiscing these moments...

889
00:52:51,881 --> 00:52:55,122
will bring me happiness.

890
00:52:59,521 --> 00:53:00,921
It will.

891
00:53:02,122 --> 00:53:03,622
I'll make it so.

892
00:53:17,441 --> 00:53:20,472
- Mom. What are you going to do? - What?

893
00:53:20,642 --> 00:53:22,181
He's Hyung Sik's father.

894
00:53:22,182 --> 00:53:23,682
And you are my daughter.

895
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:25,311
That can't be.

896
00:53:25,611 --> 00:53:27,012
What do we call this?

897
00:53:27,111 --> 00:53:29,122
It's like an in-law is dating another in-law.

898
00:53:29,282 --> 00:53:31,691
Anyway, this can't happen.

899
00:53:32,921 --> 00:53:34,161
Mom.

900
00:53:34,162 --> 00:53:36,122
You're not going to see Mr. Jung Chun Sam again, right?

901
00:53:36,791 --> 00:53:38,032
I will see him.

902
00:53:38,231 --> 00:53:41,361
He's the first romantic guy I've met in my life.

903
00:53:42,131 --> 00:53:44,231
I don't want to break up with Hyung Sik either.

904
00:53:45,072 --> 00:53:46,770
You can date someone else.

905
00:53:46,771 --> 00:53:48,802
You can just date anyone you see on the street.

906
00:53:49,202 --> 00:53:50,401
Mom.

907
00:53:51,271 --> 00:53:53,541
So that's your opinion of me.

908
00:53:54,282 --> 00:53:57,141
- What? - A woman who dates any man.

909
00:53:57,142 --> 00:53:59,552
What are you talking about? Don't pick at my words.

910
00:53:59,981 --> 00:54:01,321
You can date Seoung Il.

911
00:54:01,322 --> 00:54:03,051
That's good for everyone.

912
00:54:03,052 --> 00:54:05,321
Why must I think about other people?

913
00:54:05,322 --> 00:54:07,151
I must follow my heart.

914
00:54:07,222 --> 00:54:08,520
I just want to date a man.

915
00:54:08,521 --> 00:54:09,861
Why must I think about everyone else?

916
00:54:10,521 --> 00:54:13,730
You said you didn't want Woo Ri to date Raphael for the baby's sake.

917
00:54:13,731 --> 00:54:14,861
You...

918
00:54:16,032 --> 00:54:17,900
Gosh. You are still immature.

919
00:54:17,901 --> 00:54:19,532
Isn't that what moms are supposed to do?

920
00:54:20,072 --> 00:54:22,371
Shouldn't they yield for their daughter's happiness?

921
00:54:22,372 --> 00:54:23,540
Isn't that what moms do?

922
00:54:23,541 --> 00:54:24,770
No.

923
00:54:24,771 --> 00:54:26,441
I don't want to yield this time.

924
00:54:27,311 --> 00:54:28,811
I hate that I'm your daughter too.

925
00:54:30,512 --> 00:54:32,211
I'm home.

926
00:54:40,151 --> 00:54:41,591
What's up with the mood here?

927
00:54:48,501 --> 00:54:50,631
You're so pathetic.

928
00:54:55,202 --> 00:54:56,271
What's this?

929
00:54:58,611 --> 00:55:00,440
Throw that out. It's bad luck.

930
00:55:00,441 --> 00:55:01,441
What's this?

931
00:55:01,442 --> 00:55:03,141
No Man Chul gave it to me.

932
00:55:03,142 --> 00:55:04,851
It's bad luck. So throw it out.

933
00:55:04,852 --> 00:55:06,512
This isn't silver.

934
00:55:07,182 --> 00:55:08,381
Is it white gold?

935
00:55:08,622 --> 00:55:10,151
We can sell it.

936
00:55:13,452 --> 00:55:14,921
Throw it out.

937
00:55:21,901 --> 00:55:23,131
What's that?

938
00:55:28,302 --> 00:55:29,471
What is this?

939
00:55:29,472 --> 00:55:30,801
(Doo Min Sik, Fraud, Murder, Entry via container, Philippines)

940
00:55:30,802 --> 00:55:32,371
(Oh Dong Ho. Larceny, Entry via fishing boat, Thailand)

941
00:55:32,372 --> 00:55:34,111
Murder. Rape.

942
00:55:35,512 --> 00:55:37,782
It doesn't look like it's a hospital-related document.

943
00:55:38,211 --> 00:55:39,381
Mom.

944
00:55:40,111 --> 00:55:41,981
No Man Chul was hiding this.

945
00:55:42,421 --> 00:55:45,352
This jerk knew he was in danger, so he left it with me.

946
00:55:46,191 --> 00:55:48,091
Don't you know him? He's called Chairman Kim, the drug dealer.

947
00:55:48,521 --> 00:55:50,822
I have my hands on one of the lists that'll make money.

948
00:55:51,432 --> 00:55:52,662
Chairman Kim?

949
00:55:53,191 --> 00:55:54,401
That Chairman Kim?

950
00:55:54,961 --> 00:55:56,130
Mom, you know him?

951
00:55:56,131 --> 00:55:58,302
I've heard of him too.

952
00:55:59,372 --> 00:56:01,102
Doesn't he sell drugs?

953
00:56:01,372 --> 00:56:02,471
Right.

954
00:56:02,472 --> 00:56:04,001
The faceless chairman.

955
00:56:04,472 --> 00:56:06,811
No one has seen him.

956
00:56:07,881 --> 00:56:09,111
Look.

957
00:56:09,881 --> 00:56:13,111
The hospital was laundering the criminals' identities.

958
00:56:13,251 --> 00:56:15,822
These criminals got new faces and identities.

959
00:56:16,282 --> 00:56:18,621
No Man Chul probably threatened him with this list...

960
00:56:18,622 --> 00:56:19,791
in exchange for a big sum of cash.

961
00:56:20,521 --> 00:56:22,020
That's how he got killed. Right?

962
00:56:22,021 --> 00:56:23,091
Right.

963
00:56:23,561 --> 00:56:24,892
Then...

964
00:56:25,992 --> 00:56:27,460
this list will make us money.

965
00:56:27,461 --> 00:56:28,901
Don't you get any stupid ideas!

966
00:56:29,401 --> 00:56:31,001
No Man Chul died because of this.

967
00:56:31,731 --> 00:56:32,901
Throw this out.

968
00:56:33,131 --> 00:56:35,001
You keep the list with you.

969
00:56:35,271 --> 00:56:37,602
Give the necklace to someone.

970
00:56:38,771 --> 00:56:39,972
Like who?

971
00:56:40,211 --> 00:56:43,142
Give it to the woman you hate for making you miserable.

972
00:56:43,541 --> 00:56:45,352
Give it to her.

973
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:47,211
Oh Woo Ri?

974
00:56:48,251 --> 00:56:50,421
What if she gets hurt?

975
00:56:51,052 --> 00:56:52,121
Mom.

976
00:56:52,122 --> 00:56:54,561
I told you I didn't want anything to happen to the baby.

977
00:56:55,492 --> 00:56:56,892
My daughter, Mal Ja.

978
00:56:57,361 --> 00:56:59,992
You're worried about someone else getting hurt.

979
00:57:00,131 --> 00:57:01,501
But what about my legs?

980
00:57:02,461 --> 00:57:04,432
You don't care what happened to my legs.

981
00:57:06,771 --> 00:57:09,941
No. That's not what I meant, Mom.

982
00:57:10,742 --> 00:57:12,642
I do everything you tell me to do.

983
00:57:14,611 --> 00:57:16,881
We're just going to scare her a bit.

984
00:57:17,541 --> 00:57:20,082
I doubt Chairman Kim will senselessly kill people like that.

985
00:57:20,512 --> 00:57:22,881
He won't hurt the baby like that.

986
00:57:23,921 --> 00:57:26,191
We're just having some fun.

987
00:57:26,552 --> 00:57:27,921
Nothing will happen to her.

988
00:57:28,662 --> 00:57:29,861
Besides,

989
00:57:30,262 --> 00:57:33,590
what if she finds out that the hospital is helping...

990
00:57:33,591 --> 00:57:35,431
these criminals?

991
00:57:35,432 --> 00:57:38,001
"Raphael is a dangerous man."

992
00:57:38,372 --> 00:57:40,702
Wouldn't she be scared of him?

993
00:57:41,501 --> 00:57:43,401
We need to cause a rift between them...

994
00:57:43,972 --> 00:57:45,512
and get them to break up.

995
00:57:46,372 --> 00:57:48,041
Do you understand?

996
00:57:49,811 --> 00:57:51,040
Then...

997
00:57:51,041 --> 00:57:52,582
what do I do first?

998
00:58:48,990 --> 00:58:50,791
Where's the necklace?

999
00:59:28,990 --> 00:59:31,760

00:59:32,001 --> 00:59:34,830
Grandma!

1001
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:37,100
It's because of me.

1002
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:40,941
I'll take care of Woo Ri.

1003
00:59:41,341 --> 00:59:42,770
During those two years Chairman Kim kept quiet,

1004
00:59:42,771 --> 00:59:44,409
Raphael was fighting cancer.

1005
00:59:44,410 --> 00:59:46,481
As soon as he came back to work, Chairman Kim struck again.

1006
00:59:46,611 --> 00:59:48,981
There's a lady I like.

1007
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:51,480
Lately, she's been having a hard time.

1008
00:59:51,481 --> 00:59:54,150
So I hope this will entertain her even if it's brief.

1009
00:59:54,151 --> 00:59:55,420
We can catch Chairman Kim now.

1010
00:59:55,421 --> 00:59:56,691
We have a warrant.

1011
00:59:57,021 --> 00:59:58,090
Woo Ri!

1012
00:59:58,091 --> 00:59:59,691
You can't be with this man!

1013
01:00:04,390 --> 01:00:08,671
