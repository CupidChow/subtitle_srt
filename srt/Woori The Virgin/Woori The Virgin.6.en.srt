(Woori the Virgin)

00:00:38,141 --> 00:00:39,412
We're over.

10
00:00:42,011 --> 00:00:43,111
I mean it.

11
00:00:47,522 --> 00:00:48,681
Woo Ri.

12
00:00:50,622 --> 00:00:52,552
You say we're over.

13
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:56,122
And you're getting farther away.

14
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:00,092
But I can't seem to stop you.

15
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:03,401
I'm just watching you walk away.

16
00:01:05,172 --> 00:01:07,802
(Episode 6)

17
00:01:13,942 --> 00:01:15,382
- What about Raphael? - I see.

18
00:01:16,882 --> 00:01:19,211
- I had to clean up afterward. - Okay.

19
00:01:20,451 --> 00:01:23,320
- You should debut as a singer. - Wasn't she amazing?

20
00:01:23,321 --> 00:01:25,052
- Seriously. - Was I good?

21
00:01:26,321 --> 00:01:28,391
- Should we go to karaoke? - Sounds good.

22
00:01:28,392 --> 00:01:29,891
- Sounds good, right? - Sure.

23
00:01:29,892 --> 00:01:32,730
You take after your mother. Of course, you're a great singer.

24
00:01:32,731 --> 00:01:34,132
That's a great idea.

25
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,532
By the way, aren't you hungry?

26
00:01:36,632 --> 00:01:38,132
Hey, Kang Jae!

27
00:01:40,032 --> 00:01:41,841
- Hey. - Kang Jae.

28
00:01:43,442 --> 00:01:45,472
I'm glad Kang Jae could make it.

29
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:46,972
Me too.

30
00:01:47,582 --> 00:01:49,382
Work ended later than I expected.

31
00:01:50,612 --> 00:01:53,181
Woo Ri. Can you show me the video too?

32
00:01:53,311 --> 00:01:54,352
Sure.

33
00:01:54,582 --> 00:01:56,420
It must have been a lot of work to put this together.

34
00:01:56,421 --> 00:01:58,421
No. I didn't do much.

35
00:01:58,621 --> 00:02:01,222
I'm grateful that Raphael helped me put this together.

36
00:02:02,821 --> 00:02:04,221
Woo Ri. Eat a lot.

37
00:02:04,222 --> 00:02:05,831
Raphael wanted to come here...

38
00:02:05,832 --> 00:02:07,332
because beef is good for pregnant women.

39
00:02:08,132 --> 00:02:09,332
Eat a lot.

40
00:02:09,502 --> 00:02:11,370
It's hard to make a reservation at this restaurant.

41
00:02:11,371 --> 00:02:13,801
But I was able to snatch a table thanks to my connection.

42
00:02:14,571 --> 00:02:16,541
It's melting in my mouth.

43
00:02:16,801 --> 00:02:18,241
It's expensive meat.

44
00:02:18,741 --> 00:02:21,481
Should I proactively order more? How about tenderloin?

45
00:02:21,741 --> 00:02:23,640
Should we order a few servings to see how it tastes?

46
00:02:23,641 --> 00:02:25,111
- Sure. - Yes.

47
00:02:26,682 --> 00:02:27,852
- Let's do that. - Great.

48
00:02:29,122 --> 00:02:30,990
- Eat a lot, Mom. - Okay.

49
00:02:30,991 --> 00:02:32,192
- It's so good. - Raphael.

50
00:02:32,722 --> 00:02:34,361
Raphael, did you pay for the meal?

51
00:02:34,761 --> 00:02:36,290
Of course. I invited you here.

52
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:37,890
Why did you do it? I should have paid for it!

53
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:39,061
This was a family meal.

54
00:02:39,062 --> 00:02:40,330
Gosh. Don't mention it.

55
00:02:40,331 --> 00:02:43,532
Ms. Oh and the baby ate the food.

56
00:02:44,701 --> 00:02:46,801
Thank you for the meal.

57
00:02:47,032 --> 00:02:49,902
Ms. Oh, we should have seafood next time.

58
00:02:49,972 --> 00:02:51,841
Seafood is great for pregnant women too.

59
00:02:51,842 --> 00:02:54,240
I know an excellent chef who cooks Japanese cuisine.

60
00:02:54,241 --> 00:02:55,641
Really? Where is the restaurant?

61
00:02:55,712 --> 00:02:58,951
Gangnam? It already sounds so delicious.

62
00:02:59,682 --> 00:03:01,882
- It'll be my treat then. - No, it'll be my treat.

63
00:03:02,852 --> 00:03:04,321
- Don't fight. - Okay.

64
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:09,321
- Of course. - Gosh.

65
00:03:09,421 --> 00:03:11,291
- Just set a date. - Of course.

66
00:03:11,532 --> 00:03:12,662
You.

67
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,602
I made myself clear. My answer is no.

68
00:03:15,261 --> 00:03:17,831
What are you talking about after you just barged in here?

69
00:03:17,932 --> 00:03:19,032
No divorce.

70
00:03:20,801 --> 00:03:22,472
Gosh. Dad.

71
00:03:22,972 --> 00:03:25,811
Should I tell you everything she's done?

72
00:03:25,812 --> 00:03:26,912
She already told me everything.

73
00:03:27,241 --> 00:03:29,182
No Man Chul was hitting on her.

74
00:03:29,282 --> 00:03:32,050
Jerks like him hit on her because she's so pretty.

75
00:03:32,051 --> 00:03:33,051
That's not all.

76
00:03:33,152 --> 00:03:35,181
She almost sued me!

77
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:36,251
She told me that too.

78
00:03:36,252 --> 00:03:38,950
Imagine how desperate she must have been to do so!

79
00:03:38,951 --> 00:03:39,951
Seriously?

80
00:03:39,952 --> 00:03:41,891
You'll just side with her whatever she does?

81
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:43,421
Why are you so lenient with her?

82
00:03:44,321 --> 00:03:45,761
The Star Cafe building in Nonhyeon-dong.

83
00:03:46,692 --> 00:03:48,331
I'll transfer the deed to her.

84
00:03:49,132 --> 00:03:50,961
What? Why all of a sudden?

85
00:03:50,962 --> 00:03:52,402
If you don't take care of her,

86
00:03:52,701 --> 00:03:54,170
I will.

87
00:03:54,171 --> 00:03:55,442
Have you gone mad?

88
00:03:55,671 --> 00:03:58,240
Why do you like someone who threatened me and cheated on me?

89
00:03:58,241 --> 00:03:59,472
Of course, I do.

90
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:01,211
I like her more than you by a mile.

91
00:04:01,212 --> 00:04:04,510
I have never liked anyone as much as this in my life.

92
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:06,450
Then why don't you live with her?

93
00:04:06,451 --> 00:04:07,881
You little...

94
00:04:07,882 --> 00:04:10,122
You ungrateful punk!

95
00:04:14,491 --> 00:04:16,321
You're a poor judge of character!

96
00:04:16,421 --> 00:04:20,190
Where do you think you can meet a beautiful girl like her?

97
00:04:20,191 --> 00:04:22,500
She's beautiful and kind.

98
00:04:22,501 --> 00:04:24,231
A jerk like you doesn't deserve...

99
00:04:26,231 --> 00:04:27,371
No divorce.

100
00:04:32,642 --> 00:04:34,211
Do you know what just happened?

101
00:04:34,212 --> 00:04:36,841
Gosh. This is amazing!

102
00:04:36,842 --> 00:04:39,111
I guess there's always a way out of trouble.

103
00:04:42,022 --> 00:04:43,152
Mom?

104
00:04:43,621 --> 00:04:44,822
Hello?

105
00:04:45,222 --> 00:04:48,121
I need you to come home.

106
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:50,691
Now? Why?

107
00:04:51,462 --> 00:04:52,631
Is something wrong?

108
00:05:06,611 --> 00:05:08,980
What are you doing? Have you gone mad?

109
00:05:08,981 --> 00:05:10,181
Mal Ja.

110
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:11,811
Be nice.

111
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:15,282
Your husband is here to say hello to his dear mother-in-law.

112
00:05:17,582 --> 00:05:20,592
Listen. I was going to apologize for what I did to her legs...

113
00:05:22,462 --> 00:05:24,222
and get an apology for making me rot in there for three years.

114
00:05:25,532 --> 00:05:27,131
Your current husband should be here...

115
00:05:27,431 --> 00:05:29,061
to witness this touching moment.

116
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:30,762
Right?

117
00:05:31,131 --> 00:05:32,901
Get out before I call the cops!

118
00:05:32,902 --> 00:05:34,801
You should've done that before then. You can't call the cops.

119
00:05:34,871 --> 00:05:37,102
If you do, your little con here will be ruined.

120
00:05:37,171 --> 00:05:38,512
Fine. Okay.

121
00:05:39,171 --> 00:05:40,441
Let's end it all.

122
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:42,541
This is the end for both of us.

123
00:05:53,491 --> 00:05:54,592
You!

124
00:05:57,421 --> 00:05:58,532
Darn it.

125
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:14,582
Come on!

126
00:06:15,012 --> 00:06:16,181
Seriously.

127
00:06:56,152 --> 00:06:57,851
We found the drug bottle at the scene.

128
00:06:57,852 --> 00:06:59,892
The autopsy report says there are no signs of a homicide.

129
00:07:00,152 --> 00:07:01,521
Shin Mi Young killed herself...

130
00:07:01,522 --> 00:07:03,222
out of guilt for killing No Man Chul.

131
00:07:03,522 --> 00:07:06,092
We're going to close the case with that. What's the problem?

132
00:07:06,731 --> 00:07:07,832
Captain.

133
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:09,561
I've been thinking.

134
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:10,902
But what she said right before she died...

135
00:07:11,202 --> 00:07:12,332
Hospital...

136
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:14,572
Chairman Kim...

137
00:07:15,671 --> 00:07:16,870
I think she was trying to tell us...

138
00:07:16,871 --> 00:07:18,072
Chairman Kim was at Diamond Medical Foundation.

139
00:07:18,611 --> 00:07:20,071
Do you investigate based on your opinions?

140
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:21,512
You said you weren't sure at the scene.

141
00:07:21,611 --> 00:07:22,741
Captain.

142
00:07:23,981 --> 00:07:25,082
Come on.

143
00:07:25,811 --> 00:07:27,652
Consider even the smallest possibility,

144
00:07:27,981 --> 00:07:29,480
and let me investigate Diamond Medical Foundation.

145
00:07:29,481 --> 00:07:31,221
Do you think you can find Chairman Kim...

146
00:07:31,222 --> 00:07:32,822
by investigating an irrelevant hospital?

147
00:07:33,392 --> 00:07:34,791
Hey, it's obvious...

148
00:07:35,222 --> 00:07:38,162
that she killed him because of money and poisoned herself.

149
00:07:38,392 --> 00:07:40,592
It's abnormal to think otherwise.

150
00:07:41,702 --> 00:07:44,231
I'm sorry about what happened to Ms. Shin Mi Young.

151
00:07:45,301 --> 00:07:46,671
You must be devastated.

152
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:20,572
Knock, knock.

153
00:08:22,202 --> 00:08:23,572
Hello.

154
00:08:24,072 --> 00:08:25,912
Ms. Yu stepped out for a moment.

155
00:08:26,041 --> 00:08:28,282
I'm here to see my daughter.

156
00:08:29,811 --> 00:08:30,941
Here.

157
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:34,311
I took this photo for a scene in the drama.

158
00:08:34,952 --> 00:08:36,281
And I Photoshopped your face.

159
00:08:38,192 --> 00:08:40,151
Thank you.

160
00:08:41,361 --> 00:08:43,391
I'll take this home.

161
00:08:44,761 --> 00:08:46,161
Is this why you came?

162
00:08:46,261 --> 00:08:47,531
No.

163
00:08:49,401 --> 00:08:50,531
Woo Ri.

164
00:08:50,761 --> 00:08:52,571
I won't tell you what to do...

165
00:08:52,572 --> 00:08:54,371
with your life now.

166
00:08:54,842 --> 00:08:56,472
Including your pregnancy and giving birth.

167
00:08:57,572 --> 00:09:00,641
I understood you gave it a lot of thought to make this decision.

168
00:09:01,781 --> 00:09:03,141
By the way,

169
00:09:03,281 --> 00:09:06,511
could we discuss the lawsuit against the hospital again?

170
00:09:07,611 --> 00:09:10,281
Let's meet with Raphael when we have time. Okay?

171
00:09:10,682 --> 00:09:13,651
Pregnancy, giving birth, Raphael, and lawsuit?

172
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:16,261
Seoung Il. What are you talking about?

173
00:09:16,991 --> 00:09:18,230
Nothing.

174
00:09:18,231 --> 00:09:19,562
You must have misheard me.

175
00:09:19,962 --> 00:09:22,031
Nonsense. I heard everything.

176
00:09:22,202 --> 00:09:24,932
I came by too often. Didn't I?

177
00:09:25,001 --> 00:09:27,401
I'm only getting in your way.

178
00:09:28,342 --> 00:09:29,602
Bye, my daughter.

179
00:09:32,741 --> 00:09:34,312
You're great, but learn to read the room!

180
00:09:35,281 --> 00:09:37,241
Seoung Il!

181
00:09:37,741 --> 00:09:38,852
Woo Ri's father!

182
00:09:39,651 --> 00:09:42,321
I know you can't understand me, but that's my decision.

183
00:09:42,322 --> 00:09:44,422
So please don't try to talk me out of it.

184
00:09:45,922 --> 00:09:47,352
Are you sure about this?

185
00:09:48,361 --> 00:09:50,021
Are your mother and grandmother okay with this?

186
00:09:51,062 --> 00:09:53,431
They couldn't understand me at first.

187
00:09:53,432 --> 00:09:55,501
But now, they do. And they are being supportive.

188
00:09:57,361 --> 00:09:59,131
I don't think I can ever understand you.

189
00:09:59,871 --> 00:10:01,271
What about Kang Jae? What did he say?

190
00:10:01,572 --> 00:10:02,871
He said he supported my decision.

191
00:10:03,271 --> 00:10:04,401
But still.

192
00:10:05,111 --> 00:10:07,842
He respected his girlfriend's pledge and abstained for her.

193
00:10:07,911 --> 00:10:09,682
But she got pregnant with another man's child.

194
00:10:09,812 --> 00:10:12,651
And he kept seeing the baby's father around his girlfriend.

195
00:10:14,011 --> 00:10:17,322
Gosh. Kang Jae must be so frustrated.

196
00:10:34,942 --> 00:10:36,241
- Hey. - You startled me.

197
00:10:37,472 --> 00:10:38,971
What was that?

198
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:40,610
You startled me. Did you get off work?

199
00:10:40,611 --> 00:10:42,410
Yes. What is that?

200
00:10:42,411 --> 00:10:44,211
You didn't even notice me sneaking up on you.

201
00:10:44,212 --> 00:10:46,281
It's a lead I couldn't figure out.

202
00:10:46,352 --> 00:10:48,421
- What is it? - It's evidence for a case.

203
00:10:48,422 --> 00:10:49,852
But I can't figure out the numbers.

204
00:10:51,422 --> 00:10:52,521
Me neither.

205
00:10:53,891 --> 00:10:55,822
- If I figure it out, I'll tell you. - Okay.

206
00:10:58,861 --> 00:11:00,261
- Kang Jae. - Yes.

207
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:02,661
This is tough on you, right?

208
00:11:03,361 --> 00:11:05,771
Gosh. Was it that obvious?

209
00:11:06,501 --> 00:11:08,572
I'm having a hard time with the current case.

210
00:11:08,972 --> 00:11:10,271
Not that.

211
00:11:12,572 --> 00:11:15,212
I just thought you must have a hard time because of my situation.

212
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:18,042
Why do you say that? Why would that be tough on me?

213
00:11:18,852 --> 00:11:21,682
Seeing you brings me a lot of energy even when I'm tired.

214
00:11:24,422 --> 00:11:27,092
- Thank you. - Why are you thanking me?

215
00:11:27,621 --> 00:11:29,591
Thank you for staying by my side...

216
00:11:29,592 --> 00:11:31,760
and asking me why I'm thanking you.

217
00:11:31,761 --> 00:11:33,792
Come on. What was that?

218
00:11:35,062 --> 00:11:37,030
- Kang Jae. Grandma cooked us food. - Yes?

219
00:11:37,031 --> 00:11:39,932
- Let's go eat. - Really? What did she cook?

220
00:11:40,172 --> 00:11:41,900
I want to guess it.

221
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:43,701
Kimchi stew. It's kimchi stew, right?

222
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:45,270
I don't know. Let's just go inside.

223
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:47,271
Come on. Just tell me.

224
00:12:08,802 --> 00:12:10,401
Why did Park Du Pal...

225
00:12:10,501 --> 00:12:12,230
Why did he come here?

226
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,500
Should I have just given him money and sent him on his way?

227
00:12:14,501 --> 00:12:17,001
He asked for a million dollars! We don't have that kind of money!

228
00:12:17,442 --> 00:12:19,971
Without the money, he would've caused trouble for ruining his life.

229
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:23,041
Ruin his life? He doesn't get to say that!

230
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:25,352
He's responsible for what happened to your legs!

231
00:12:25,682 --> 00:12:28,051
Don't get so worked up.

232
00:12:28,052 --> 00:12:31,082
- Are you okay? - Yes, I'm okay.

233
00:12:34,092 --> 00:12:37,361
Mom, what about you? Are you all right?

234
00:12:37,422 --> 00:12:39,531
I'm all right.

235
00:12:40,731 --> 00:12:42,361
But is he going to be okay?

236
00:12:53,141 --> 00:12:54,910
- What about Kang Jae? - He left.

237
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,880
He should have had some fruit before he went.

238
00:12:56,881 --> 00:12:58,042
He has work.

239
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:04,052
Mom, it's about Kang Jae.

240
00:13:04,422 --> 00:13:06,621
What is it? Did something happen to him?

241
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:09,322
No. It's me.

242
00:13:09,761 --> 00:13:12,661
It will be hard to understand my decision to have this baby.

243
00:13:12,891 --> 00:13:16,001
Whenever we see Raphael, he'll be uncomfortable.

244
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,302
This must not be easy for him in many ways.

245
00:13:18,602 --> 00:13:20,202
Obviously.

246
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:22,641
Didn't I tell you? He's a saint.

247
00:13:23,001 --> 00:13:25,711
No men in Korea would be able to understand your decision.

248
00:13:25,712 --> 00:13:28,211
My goodness. If you knew that, why did you enjoy beef so much...

249
00:13:28,212 --> 00:13:30,041
when Raphael bought us the meal?

250
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:31,541
Mom, you ate more than me.

251
00:13:31,542 --> 00:13:35,621
He always tells me he's okay, but that makes me feel worse.

252
00:13:36,182 --> 00:13:39,490
Woo Ri. In life, there will be difficult times.

253
00:13:39,491 --> 00:13:41,151
Life isn't all sunshine and rainbows.

254
00:13:41,592 --> 00:13:43,922
At times like this, you're supposed to take things easy.

255
00:13:44,261 --> 00:13:46,360
Some fresh air and a break...

256
00:13:46,361 --> 00:13:47,761
will bring you energy.

257
00:13:49,031 --> 00:13:51,602
Kang Jae wanted to go camping.

258
00:13:54,702 --> 00:13:55,802
Woo Ri.

259
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:59,312
Gosh. Give me that. It's heavy. How did you carry that?

260
00:13:59,442 --> 00:14:02,442
Gosh. Kang Jae, the tent looks so beautiful.

261
00:14:03,212 --> 00:14:05,182
And the view here is amazing too.

262
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:06,381
Right?

263
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:09,481
A senior colleague who loves camping told me about this amazing spot.

264
00:14:09,881 --> 00:14:12,091
The view is superb, but not a lot of people know this spot.

265
00:14:12,092 --> 00:14:13,391
So it's quiet. It's the best camping spot.

266
00:14:13,722 --> 00:14:15,192
Seriously. I love it here.

267
00:14:17,962 --> 00:14:20,191
Wait. Kang Jae.

268
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,201
- Yes? - Is it going to rain today?

269
00:14:22,202 --> 00:14:25,202
No. The weather is great today. What do you mean?

270
00:14:26,702 --> 00:14:28,501
Hey.

271
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:30,602
It is raining.

272
00:14:33,011 --> 00:14:34,472
It's raining too hard.

273
00:14:34,641 --> 00:14:36,510
Kang Jae, come in. Don't stand in the rain.

274
00:14:36,511 --> 00:14:37,542
It should stop soon.

275
00:14:38,182 --> 00:14:40,551
The supercomputer at the forecast center is useless.

276
00:14:40,552 --> 00:14:41,922
You must be cold.

277
00:14:44,582 --> 00:14:47,490
Hey, you still wear that.

278
00:14:47,491 --> 00:14:48,491
What?

279
00:14:49,161 --> 00:14:50,822
This? What about this?

280
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:53,761
You were wearing that when we first met.

281
00:14:54,592 --> 00:14:56,831
Gosh. You remember what I wore?

282
00:14:56,832 --> 00:14:58,972
How could I forget?

283
00:15:01,031 --> 00:15:04,871
Right. We had a spark even from our first meeting.

284
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:06,972
We must catch this woman no matter what.

285
00:15:07,212 --> 00:15:09,042
Seriously? Robber Beauty?

286
00:15:09,582 --> 00:15:13,182
Hey. Look. Isn't she the robber?

287
00:15:14,682 --> 00:15:17,582
Yes, that's her. She is pretty indeed.

288
00:15:17,822 --> 00:15:18,991
Ms. Oh Na Hyun.

289
00:15:21,422 --> 00:15:23,192
I'm not Oh Na Hyun.

290
00:15:23,962 --> 00:15:25,192
Wait.

291
00:15:34,932 --> 00:15:37,471
- Drop it. - I want to go home.

292
00:15:37,472 --> 00:15:38,812
Drop it.

293
00:15:43,281 --> 00:15:45,352
You left this.

294
00:15:47,212 --> 00:15:49,751
Again, I'm really sorry. I mean it.

295
00:15:52,391 --> 00:15:56,161
I have a question. Why were you carrying a big knife?

296
00:15:57,761 --> 00:15:59,631
When I saw the knife, it startled me.

297
00:16:00,761 --> 00:16:03,031
My grandma cuts pork cutlets with this knife.

298
00:16:03,802 --> 00:16:05,172
She wanted me to sharpen the knife.

299
00:16:05,771 --> 00:16:07,901
I see.

300
00:16:09,271 --> 00:16:12,542
Are you sure you don't want to report this at the station?

301
00:16:13,771 --> 00:16:15,711
I just want to go home now.

302
00:16:15,712 --> 00:16:19,212
I'm sorry. Please get home safely.

303
00:16:29,161 --> 00:16:31,760
Seriously. I thought I was going to get fired.

304
00:16:31,761 --> 00:16:33,291
But I could keep my job when you said you were okay.

305
00:16:33,292 --> 00:16:35,230
No, I wasn't okay.

306
00:16:35,231 --> 00:16:37,630
That day, I really didn't care about anything else...

307
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:39,271
than getting home right away.

308
00:16:40,072 --> 00:16:41,972
- But I ended up saving your job. - Yes.

309
00:16:42,741 --> 00:16:45,641
You saved my job, so I'll bring home the bacon.

310
00:16:46,241 --> 00:16:49,241
Right. You should. I'm getting hungry.

311
00:16:50,481 --> 00:16:51,952
We can't have a barbecue today.

312
00:16:53,911 --> 00:16:55,151
Right.

313
00:16:56,151 --> 00:16:59,052
It's unfortunate we can't have a barbecue,

314
00:16:59,292 --> 00:17:01,521
but eating outdoors makes everything taste better.

315
00:17:02,692 --> 00:17:06,692
I'll make you my special pork belly ramyeon with perilla leaves.

316
00:17:06,792 --> 00:17:09,531
All right. Let's see.

317
00:17:09,532 --> 00:17:12,232
Where's the gas for the portable stove?

318
00:17:15,131 --> 00:17:16,201
What?

319
00:17:17,072 --> 00:17:19,141
What is it? Did we run out of gas?

320
00:17:19,411 --> 00:17:22,181
(Bug Repellent Spray)

321
00:17:22,381 --> 00:17:23,881
Why...

322
00:17:24,312 --> 00:17:26,381
I'm sure I packed a gas cartridge.

323
00:17:32,592 --> 00:17:33,691
Woo Ri.

324
00:17:35,762 --> 00:17:37,762
Should we wrap up here and go to a restaurant?

325
00:17:39,562 --> 00:17:40,631
No.

326
00:17:42,131 --> 00:17:44,661
When the rain stops, let's stargaze.

327
00:17:45,062 --> 00:17:46,471
I'm not hungry at all.

328
00:17:52,242 --> 00:17:54,371
- Kang Jae. - Yes?

329
00:17:55,342 --> 00:17:57,710
After that incident,

330
00:17:57,711 --> 00:17:59,752
why did you start coming to church?

331
00:18:01,151 --> 00:18:02,451
Was it to see me?

332
00:18:02,721 --> 00:18:04,181
Oh, that?

333
00:18:05,992 --> 00:18:08,521
Sister, did you like the sermon today?

334
00:18:08,522 --> 00:18:11,691
I happened to see you at church when I was passing by.

335
00:18:14,691 --> 00:18:16,062
Are you new here?

336
00:18:16,832 --> 00:18:18,630
- Pardon? - This is great.

337
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:21,941
Our teaching for new members will begin this week.

338
00:18:22,971 --> 00:18:24,741
Then someone caught me there,

339
00:18:24,742 --> 00:18:26,440
so I ended up signing up for the class.

340
00:18:26,441 --> 00:18:28,541
- Where do I write my name? - Write the date first.

341
00:18:28,542 --> 00:18:29,711
Stop lying.

342
00:18:29,982 --> 00:18:31,812
You came to my grandma's restaurant every day.

343
00:18:31,951 --> 00:18:34,210
If you need more food, let me know. You're a regular here.

344
00:18:34,211 --> 00:18:37,421
Ma'am, your pork cutlet is tasty. I can't stay away.

345
00:18:37,552 --> 00:18:38,591
Thanks.

346
00:18:38,592 --> 00:18:40,291
I explained that to you.

347
00:18:40,292 --> 00:18:42,522
I went to the restaurant often because her pork cutlet was tasty.

348
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:43,992
- I'm home. - And it happened to be...

349
00:18:44,522 --> 00:18:45,731
your grandma's restaurant.

350
00:18:45,732 --> 00:18:46,792
What?

351
00:18:47,631 --> 00:18:49,461
- Hey. - Do you know him?

352
00:18:49,701 --> 00:18:52,200
He comes to our church.

353
00:18:52,201 --> 00:18:55,002
What? Do you go to our church?

354
00:18:57,042 --> 00:18:58,471
I'll go inside.

355
00:19:09,151 --> 00:19:11,852
I see. The knife for the pork cutlets.

356
00:19:14,951 --> 00:19:16,262
She's never had a boyfriend?

357
00:19:16,361 --> 00:19:18,191
I'm not sure she's never had a boyfriend.

358
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:20,661
But I've known her since elementary school.

359
00:19:21,191 --> 00:19:23,131
But she rarely talks to men.

360
00:19:24,861 --> 00:19:26,532
Because of the Abstinence Pledge?

361
00:19:26,701 --> 00:19:28,501
It's a doctrine of our religion.

362
00:19:28,502 --> 00:19:31,002
But it's not easy to follow it in our modern times.

363
00:19:31,171 --> 00:19:34,572
Sister Maria is such a pure soul.

364
00:19:35,072 --> 00:19:36,681
She's the pride of our church!

365
00:19:41,052 --> 00:19:42,252
So you get the gist.

366
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:50,661
How did you feel when you find out about the pledge?

367
00:19:51,492 --> 00:19:53,861
I just thought that you were a devout Catholic.

368
00:19:55,092 --> 00:19:56,832
I thought you would never date men.

369
00:19:58,262 --> 00:20:01,671
Then why did you ask me out after two years?

370
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:07,111
Whenever I saw you at church, I thought you were a nice person.

371
00:20:08,572 --> 00:20:09,742
So,

372
00:20:09,782 --> 00:20:12,911
I liked seeing you once a week like that...

373
00:20:14,151 --> 00:20:16,052
Wait.

374
00:20:17,381 --> 00:20:19,420
So, you liked me first?

375
00:20:19,421 --> 00:20:20,592
You liked me before I liked you.

376
00:20:22,562 --> 00:20:23,992
Yes.

377
00:20:25,492 --> 00:20:27,532
I think I really liked you at the time.

378
00:20:28,461 --> 00:20:29,631
Kang Jae.

379
00:20:32,371 --> 00:20:34,502
Kang Jae, have you heard?

380
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:36,801
- Maria... - What about Woo Ri?

381
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:39,611
finally decided to join the convent.

382
00:20:41,871 --> 00:20:43,141
I had no idea.

383
00:20:43,282 --> 00:20:44,911
But thinking I wouldn't be able to see you anymore,

384
00:20:45,451 --> 00:20:46,582
I could let it go.

385
00:20:58,421 --> 00:20:59,592
Woo Ri,

386
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:01,161
I like you.

387
00:21:02,232 --> 00:21:03,332
Go on a date with me.

388
00:21:11,802 --> 00:21:13,971
So, you liked me first, right?

389
00:21:14,441 --> 00:21:17,441
Yes, I liked you first. I did.

390
00:21:21,611 --> 00:21:25,121
I wasn't going to tell you this.

391
00:21:26,492 --> 00:21:28,891
- But actually... - What is it?

392
00:21:30,391 --> 00:21:31,792
Well...

393
00:21:32,592 --> 00:21:33,891
Wait, what was that?

394
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:37,502
The pouring rain.

395
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:44,541
- What do we do? - It's raining too much...

396
00:21:44,542 --> 00:21:45,571
that the roof might cave in.

397
00:21:45,572 --> 00:21:47,242
I'm going to drain out the water. Hold on.

398
00:21:47,272 --> 00:21:48,441
- Be careful. - Be careful.

399
00:21:50,082 --> 00:21:51,312
- Gosh. - Gosh.

400
00:21:53,151 --> 00:21:54,211
Are you okay?

401
00:21:56,451 --> 00:21:57,582
Oh, no.

402
00:21:58,082 --> 00:21:59,890
I don't think this will work. Let's get in the car first.

403
00:21:59,891 --> 00:22:01,621
This won't work. Let's go.

404
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:04,161
Kang Jae, you should get some sleep.

405
00:22:04,421 --> 00:22:05,861
Didn't you work late last night?

406
00:22:06,292 --> 00:22:07,461
No, it's okay.

407
00:22:08,062 --> 00:22:10,661
However, it is nice and warm.

408
00:22:14,201 --> 00:22:17,502
The rain needs to stop soon.

409
00:22:18,641 --> 00:22:20,411
To wait until it stops...

410
00:22:23,742 --> 00:22:24,842
Kang Jae...

411
00:22:27,312 --> 00:22:28,451
I...

412
00:22:29,651 --> 00:22:31,082
actually...

413
00:22:40,431 --> 00:22:41,562
It's nothing. Go to sleep.

414
00:22:54,971 --> 00:22:56,141
Help!

415
00:22:56,542 --> 00:22:57,681
Help!

416
00:22:58,242 --> 00:22:59,352
What happened?

417
00:22:59,681 --> 00:23:00,981
She was tased.

418
00:23:00,982 --> 00:23:02,582
Doctor Yoo, get the bed ready. Quick.

419
00:23:14,461 --> 00:23:15,762
Hello, Maria.

420
00:23:16,431 --> 00:23:17,602
Wait.

421
00:23:18,701 --> 00:23:20,072
That guy over there.

422
00:23:20,272 --> 00:23:21,671
I think he's here for the first time.

423
00:23:48,492 --> 00:23:49,602
Sister.

424
00:23:50,131 --> 00:23:51,701
Yes, Maria. What is it?

425
00:23:51,961 --> 00:23:54,001
Can I have another...

426
00:23:54,002 --> 00:23:55,401
volunteer application for the convent?

427
00:23:56,901 --> 00:23:58,272
You just got one earlier.

428
00:23:59,342 --> 00:24:00,611
Well...

429
00:24:03,611 --> 00:24:05,312
Someone just ripped it.

430
00:24:09,052 --> 00:24:10,181
Woo Ri.

431
00:24:10,951 --> 00:24:12,151
Woo Ri.

432
00:24:13,792 --> 00:24:14,992
Yes?

433
00:24:15,992 --> 00:24:17,121
The rain stopped.

434
00:24:19,992 --> 00:24:21,961
It did.

435
00:24:22,762 --> 00:24:24,002
Let's go outside.

436
00:24:25,262 --> 00:24:26,471
Okay.

437
00:24:29,671 --> 00:24:30,971
Woo Ri, let's go quickly.

438
00:24:31,502 --> 00:24:33,512
It's cold.

439
00:25:19,191 --> 00:25:20,352
My head.

440
00:25:23,322 --> 00:25:24,461
What is this?

441
00:25:26,262 --> 00:25:27,732
What is this?

442
00:25:29,232 --> 00:25:30,901
- Mom. - Yes?

443
00:25:31,631 --> 00:25:33,302
- He woke up. - Hey.

444
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:34,901
Let me free.

445
00:25:35,971 --> 00:25:37,602
You think you'll get away with this?

446
00:25:39,512 --> 00:25:41,211
I should have covered his mouth.

447
00:25:42,211 --> 00:25:43,481
I forgot to do that.

448
00:25:43,482 --> 00:25:44,982
Should I knock him out again?

449
00:25:45,111 --> 00:25:46,282
Let me see that.

450
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:04,062
- Did you just hit me? - He fainted the last time I hit.

451
00:26:04,762 --> 00:26:05,931
Why don't you try it?

452
00:26:09,641 --> 00:26:10,772
- Take that. - Gosh.

453
00:26:10,971 --> 00:26:12,971
That won't do the trick!

454
00:26:13,042 --> 00:26:15,441
You need to hit him harder to put him out.

455
00:26:15,471 --> 00:26:16,610
Give it to me.

456
00:26:16,611 --> 00:26:19,151
No, stop it. It hurts.

457
00:26:21,852 --> 00:26:24,282
Darn it. Isn't there something else?

458
00:26:26,292 --> 00:26:27,552
What about a hammer?

459
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:28,951
A hammer?

460
00:26:29,161 --> 00:26:30,391
Wouldn't a golf club be better?

461
00:26:30,492 --> 00:26:31,822
- No, wait. I'll just bring both. - Wait!

462
00:26:36,861 --> 00:26:38,032
Stop hitting me.

463
00:26:39,631 --> 00:26:40,701
I'm sorry.

464
00:26:42,941 --> 00:26:48,072
How did she live?

465
00:26:49,342 --> 00:26:51,342
Even when I ask her

466
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,910
For the reason

467
00:26:54,911 --> 00:26:56,950
(Singing School With Eun Ran)

468
00:26:56,951 --> 00:27:03,721
Ok Gyeong Yi has her head down

469
00:27:06,232 --> 00:27:08,232
Gosh. Isn't that Choi Seoung Il?

470
00:27:10,232 --> 00:27:11,360
Is that really Choi Seoung Il?

471
00:27:11,361 --> 00:27:12,772
Is that really Choi Seoung Il?

472
00:27:16,242 --> 00:27:18,242
Who's this? Aren't you Choi Seoung Il?

473
00:27:18,371 --> 00:27:19,512
It is.

474
00:27:19,671 --> 00:27:20,971
What brings you here?

475
00:27:21,242 --> 00:27:22,941
Please, have some of this.

476
00:27:28,352 --> 00:27:29,681
How come you are here?

477
00:27:29,822 --> 00:27:31,720
Are you shooting a scene here?

478
00:27:31,721 --> 00:27:32,992
No, I'm not.

479
00:27:33,522 --> 00:27:34,621
I'm...

480
00:27:37,592 --> 00:27:40,032
friends with Ms. Oh Eun Ran.

481
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:44,431
How do you know each other?

482
00:27:45,232 --> 00:27:46,772
Well, in middle school...

483
00:27:48,802 --> 00:27:50,042
Actually,

484
00:27:50,072 --> 00:27:52,002
I really liked her in middle school.

485
00:27:56,181 --> 00:27:58,441
One thing led to another,

486
00:27:58,711 --> 00:28:01,251
I became more famous than Eun Ran.

487
00:28:01,252 --> 00:28:04,451
But Eun Ran was a star back then.

488
00:28:04,852 --> 00:28:06,920
She's pretty...

489
00:28:06,921 --> 00:28:08,052
and good at singing.

490
00:28:09,052 --> 00:28:11,591
Boys from other schools...

491
00:28:11,592 --> 00:28:12,691
came to see her.

492
00:28:12,792 --> 00:28:14,032
Gosh.

493
00:28:14,961 --> 00:28:16,032
As for me,

494
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,762
I was just happy...

495
00:28:20,232 --> 00:28:23,171
- when she talked to me. - That's so sweet.

496
00:28:23,471 --> 00:28:24,671
That's nice.

497
00:28:24,742 --> 00:28:27,471
(Eun Ran)

498
00:28:30,881 --> 00:28:32,211
- This is nice. - It is?

499
00:28:32,881 --> 00:28:34,481
- Look. - Oh, how cute.

500
00:28:34,482 --> 00:28:35,982
- They are so cute. - Hi.

501
00:28:50,961 --> 00:28:52,401
- It looks so good. - It does.

502
00:28:58,641 --> 00:28:59,741
Whose is it?

503
00:28:59,742 --> 00:29:01,341
- Mister. - Kang Jae, here.

504
00:29:01,342 --> 00:29:02,941
Haven't you lost your wallet?

505
00:29:03,042 --> 00:29:04,181
Gosh, it's gone.

506
00:29:04,812 --> 00:29:06,411
- That looks like mine. - Here you go.

507
00:29:06,512 --> 00:29:07,611
Thank you.

508
00:29:19,992 --> 00:29:21,562
- Thank you. - Thank you.

509
00:29:26,332 --> 00:29:27,701
I like this about you.

510
00:29:27,931 --> 00:29:29,031
What's there to like about me?

511
00:29:29,032 --> 00:29:31,302
You're so kind and don't lie.

512
00:29:31,671 --> 00:29:32,971
And that's why you have all the luck.

513
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:35,242
No, you're kinder.

514
00:29:35,542 --> 00:29:36,711
And you're the one who doesn't lie.

515
00:29:37,441 --> 00:29:40,252
Yes, I like that we don't hide anything from each other.

516
00:29:41,082 --> 00:29:43,681
If I didn't tell you about meeting Raphael before,

517
00:29:43,921 --> 00:29:46,522
you wouldn't have known about it.

518
00:29:46,721 --> 00:29:48,022
But I didn't want to keep it from you.

519
00:29:48,621 --> 00:29:50,121
You did the right thing.

520
00:29:50,921 --> 00:29:52,931
There's nothing to fight about if we don't lie to each other.

521
00:29:54,961 --> 00:29:56,531
Oh, right. Listen to this.

522
00:29:56,532 --> 00:29:57,831
Ms. Lee Ma Ri had an affair...

523
00:29:57,832 --> 00:30:00,272
with the guy that was murdered at the hospital.

524
00:30:00,302 --> 00:30:01,602
I think that's why they're getting a divorce.

525
00:30:01,871 --> 00:30:03,042
Did you know?

526
00:30:06,272 --> 00:30:08,141
What? Did you already know about it?

527
00:30:08,471 --> 00:30:10,042
No, I didn't.

528
00:30:10,641 --> 00:30:12,281
That's shocking.

529
00:30:12,282 --> 00:30:15,880
Kang Jae, let's not hide anything from each other...

530
00:30:15,881 --> 00:30:18,552
and not lie to each other.

531
00:30:19,891 --> 00:30:21,592
I will.

532
00:30:24,562 --> 00:30:28,832
Kang Jae, I'll try not to meet Raphael.

533
00:30:28,931 --> 00:30:29,931
Why?

534
00:30:30,131 --> 00:30:31,732
I think you would meet him often because of the baby.

535
00:30:32,062 --> 00:30:35,332
Well, I think I can sympathize with you.

536
00:30:36,141 --> 00:30:37,741
I'll try to minimize the meetings.

537
00:30:37,742 --> 00:30:40,411
But if I do, I'll tell you about it.

538
00:30:40,742 --> 00:30:42,782
That way I think you won't feel bad about it.

539
00:30:44,111 --> 00:30:45,711
Thank you for thinking about me.

540
00:30:45,982 --> 00:30:48,352
You think about me more.

541
00:30:49,482 --> 00:30:52,321
Having a trip with you is so nice.

542
00:30:52,322 --> 00:30:53,551
- You like it? - Yes.

543
00:30:53,552 --> 00:30:55,352
Where shall we go the next time?

544
00:30:58,092 --> 00:31:00,562
We took a lot of pictures on our trip.

545
00:31:01,532 --> 00:31:02,901
Thinking about it,

546
00:31:02,961 --> 00:31:04,931
I don't think we take as much as other couples.

547
00:31:05,732 --> 00:31:08,971
We can go on more trips and take more pictures from now on.

548
00:31:09,802 --> 00:31:11,901
Yes, let's do that.

549
00:31:12,342 --> 00:31:15,110
I think I'll remember this trip for a long time.

550
00:31:15,111 --> 00:31:16,211
Why is that?

551
00:31:16,681 --> 00:31:19,610
Is it because we got drenched in the rain?

552
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:20,681
Yes.

553
00:31:23,121 --> 00:31:26,921
Well, it's because it's our first trip together.

554
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:28,421
Me too.

555
00:31:29,092 --> 00:31:30,891
I think I'll remember this for a long time.

556
00:31:31,861 --> 00:31:34,061
Kang Jae, should we take a picture together?

557
00:31:34,062 --> 00:31:35,860
- Now? - No.

558
00:31:35,861 --> 00:31:39,262
You know couples get their picture taken at a studio these days.

559
00:31:39,701 --> 00:31:41,370
- They looked pretty. - I saw it on social media.

560
00:31:41,371 --> 00:31:42,430
They were pretty.

561
00:31:42,431 --> 00:31:44,141
Yes, let's do it.

562
00:31:44,842 --> 00:31:46,772
I like pictures...

563
00:31:47,242 --> 00:31:50,512
because people take pictures when they are happy.

564
00:31:51,211 --> 00:31:55,582
But when you live life, you'll have difficult moments.

565
00:31:55,951 --> 00:31:59,180
Then you can look at the pictures and remember the happy moments...

566
00:31:59,181 --> 00:32:00,352
to get motivated again.

567
00:32:01,092 --> 00:32:03,861
I want to take lots of happy pictures with you.

568
00:32:05,721 --> 00:32:08,492
Yes, let's do that.

569
00:32:15,332 --> 00:32:16,371
What?

570
00:32:16,871 --> 00:32:18,102
Look at that.

571
00:32:18,342 --> 00:32:19,342
What is it?

572
00:32:19,441 --> 00:32:21,211
Isn't that the number you said before?

573
00:32:32,022 --> 00:32:33,092
Na Hee.

574
00:32:33,891 --> 00:32:36,161
Kang Jae, aren't you on leave until today?

575
00:32:36,292 --> 00:32:38,791
- Take a look at this. - What is it?

576
00:32:38,792 --> 00:32:41,690
The memo I showed you last time was written by Shin Mi Young.

577
00:32:41,691 --> 00:32:42,732
I found what it was.

578
00:32:43,701 --> 00:32:46,032
Look, it's a number for shipping containers.

579
00:32:46,772 --> 00:32:49,501
There is something in the container coming in at Pier 3 in Incheon.

580
00:32:49,502 --> 00:32:52,072
I'm certain that products related to Chairman Kim will arrive.

581
00:32:53,242 --> 00:32:55,012
We can confiscate it after we report it.

582
00:32:56,842 --> 00:32:58,410
I think we can reveal what it is right away.

583
00:32:58,411 --> 00:33:01,481
- No, we can't report it. - Excuse me?

584
00:33:01,482 --> 00:33:03,681
If we report it, it will go to Customs and get investigated.

585
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,552
Then, we lose another chance of getting evidence on Chairman Kim.

586
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:09,221
Let's first see what is in it.

587
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:11,792
And when we can prove it has something to do with him,

588
00:33:12,062 --> 00:33:13,262
we can report it then.

589
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:15,332
All right.

590
00:33:16,262 --> 00:33:17,562
I'll help you out that day.

591
00:33:17,661 --> 00:33:19,332
I trust your detective's hunch.

592
00:33:20,532 --> 00:33:23,641
Here we go. Sorry to keep you waiting.

593
00:33:24,842 --> 00:33:27,771
I said I'd cook for you. You didn't have to cook.

594
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:30,880
Mother, this is Western noodles.

595
00:33:30,881 --> 00:33:34,150
It's spaghetti. You think I wouldn't know?

596
00:33:34,151 --> 00:33:36,921
Mother, you're so modern.

597
00:33:37,582 --> 00:33:39,651
Go ahead, try it.

598
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,352
- What's this? - What?

599
00:33:43,322 --> 00:33:44,690
Did you wash the pasta noodles?

600
00:33:44,691 --> 00:33:46,831
The sauce won't go with the noodles if you wash them.

601
00:33:46,832 --> 00:33:49,032
I have certifications for Western cuisine.

602
00:33:49,131 --> 00:33:52,731
Eun Ran, why did I say I'd cook?

603
00:33:52,732 --> 00:33:55,071
That's why I told you we should eat out.

604
00:33:55,072 --> 00:33:57,742
- Maybe we should’ve. - You should've listened to me.

605
00:33:59,141 --> 00:34:00,711
I'm home.

606
00:34:02,272 --> 00:34:05,481
- You came. - Yes, I heard you went on a trip.

607
00:34:05,482 --> 00:34:07,352
- How was it? - It was good.

608
00:34:08,552 --> 00:34:12,082
Did you eat? I cooked.

609
00:34:12,482 --> 00:34:14,191
Why don't you try some?

610
00:34:14,192 --> 00:34:16,292
No, it's okay. I ate already.

611
00:34:16,522 --> 00:34:19,261
- Okay. - Then why don't you go in and rest?

612
00:34:20,661 --> 00:34:23,962
I just want to sit here together, that's all.

613
00:34:24,732 --> 00:34:26,031
Right.

614
00:34:26,371 --> 00:34:28,671
Sitting here all together...

615
00:34:28,672 --> 00:34:30,772
feels good like we're a family.

616
00:34:32,772 --> 00:34:36,712
Mother, we're not like a family, we are a complete family.

617
00:34:38,942 --> 00:34:42,752
I wish nothing but for you two to find success.

618
00:34:43,422 --> 00:34:44,950
- Seoung Il... - Yes?

619
00:34:44,951 --> 00:34:47,091
Why did you kiss her before?

620
00:34:48,352 --> 00:34:49,352
Excuse me?

621
00:34:49,692 --> 00:34:51,821
Who? Someone kissed?

622
00:34:51,891 --> 00:34:54,462
Mom, stop talking nonsense.

623
00:34:55,362 --> 00:34:56,901
We don't have pickles.

624
00:34:56,902 --> 00:34:58,661
Yes, go and get some.

625
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:04,442
- Did you kiss her? - What? Gosh, no.

626
00:35:04,701 --> 00:35:06,611
Did you kiss him on your trip to Gangwon-do?

627
00:35:06,612 --> 00:35:09,042
- Out of the blue? - Out of the blue?

628
00:35:09,172 --> 00:35:11,641
Mother, have you kissed recently?

629
00:35:13,482 --> 00:35:14,882
Me? Why do you ask?

630
00:35:19,252 --> 00:35:20,390
Do you want me to bring it to you right now?

631
00:35:20,391 --> 00:35:22,491
No, it's okay. I don't need it right now.

632
00:35:23,062 --> 00:35:24,761
You must be tired. Go and rest.

633
00:35:25,422 --> 00:35:27,031
You can give it to me later.

634
00:35:27,132 --> 00:35:29,062
All right.

635
00:35:31,502 --> 00:35:32,632
What are you going to do now?

636
00:35:33,701 --> 00:35:35,801
I'll tidy up and go to bed.

637
00:35:37,871 --> 00:35:39,771
Kang Jae, I have a call coming in.

638
00:35:39,772 --> 00:35:41,640
All right, bye.

639
00:35:41,641 --> 00:35:43,141
Bye. Good night.

640
00:35:44,911 --> 00:35:46,281
(CEO Raphael)

641
00:35:49,352 --> 00:35:50,421
Hello?

642
00:35:50,422 --> 00:35:53,220
Ms. Oh, I'm here.

643
00:35:53,221 --> 00:35:55,022
Excuse me? Where?

644
00:35:56,862 --> 00:35:57,891
Hey.

645
00:35:58,062 --> 00:35:59,962
Sir.

646
00:36:01,991 --> 00:36:04,661
Hello. Please, sit down.

647
00:36:04,931 --> 00:36:06,062
Sure.

648
00:36:08,602 --> 00:36:10,071
I told him to come.

649
00:36:10,341 --> 00:36:11,942
I wanted to discuss something with you.

650
00:36:13,511 --> 00:36:17,241
No matter how I look at it, something still bothers me.

651
00:36:17,712 --> 00:36:20,111
- What is it? - More than anything,

652
00:36:20,112 --> 00:36:22,352
I think we should sue...

653
00:36:23,752 --> 00:36:25,681
the OB-GYN doctor.

654
00:36:32,221 --> 00:36:34,232
It'll be all right. Things will get better.

655
00:36:34,562 --> 00:36:38,031
And since we have Raphael on your side.

656
00:36:39,672 --> 00:36:41,402
With you next to her...

657
00:36:44,871 --> 00:36:48,042
(Seo Gwi Nyeo's Pork Cutlet)

658
00:36:52,911 --> 00:36:54,252
Thank you.

659
00:36:57,181 --> 00:36:59,551
- Did Raphael leave? - Yes.

660
00:37:00,821 --> 00:37:02,522
Are they suing the hospital?

661
00:37:03,091 --> 00:37:04,121
Yes.

662
00:37:05,292 --> 00:37:07,931
You have to take care of this so Woo Ri won't get hurt.

663
00:37:09,192 --> 00:37:10,261
I will.

664
00:37:12,301 --> 00:37:13,672
It's nice to have you around.

665
00:37:15,832 --> 00:37:16,902
What?

666
00:37:18,471 --> 00:37:20,172
You are of help to my daughter.

667
00:37:20,871 --> 00:37:22,871
And you're nice to my mom.

668
00:37:23,582 --> 00:37:24,612
Sure.

669
00:37:26,212 --> 00:37:29,312
I just regret the fact I couldn't do this earlier.

670
00:37:47,832 --> 00:37:49,942
- It's getting late. You should go. - I should.

671
00:37:51,071 --> 00:37:52,172
Go.

672
00:37:54,511 --> 00:37:56,411
You're the one who held my hand first.

673
00:37:57,442 --> 00:37:58,482
Bye.

674
00:38:02,281 --> 00:38:03,681
Why isn't he answering?

675
00:38:05,982 --> 00:38:08,351
Do you know how many times you're calling today?

676
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:09,692
I'm sorry.

677
00:38:10,161 --> 00:38:12,661
This never happened before.

678
00:38:12,721 --> 00:38:15,462
If you're that worried, go see him after work.

679
00:38:16,931 --> 00:38:18,962
And buy some his favorite tteokbokki on your way there.

680
00:38:21,272 --> 00:38:23,971
Hello.

681
00:38:24,371 --> 00:38:26,300
- Hello. - Woo Ri?

682
00:38:26,301 --> 00:38:29,780
Hello. Please, share this with everyone.

683
00:38:29,781 --> 00:38:30,942
Thank you.

684
00:38:32,181 --> 00:38:33,652
Where's Kang Jae?

685
00:38:34,152 --> 00:38:36,550
I think he went somewhere.

686
00:38:36,551 --> 00:38:37,752
Why don't you call him?

687
00:38:38,852 --> 00:38:40,852
I couldn't get a hold of him today.

688
00:38:42,051 --> 00:38:44,362
I don't think he's on his good side today.

689
00:38:45,192 --> 00:38:46,661
He was given a reprimand.

690
00:38:47,062 --> 00:38:49,131
- Why? - You are a witness as well...

691
00:38:49,132 --> 00:38:50,962
in the Diamond Medical Foundation murder case.

692
00:38:51,431 --> 00:38:53,971
No Man Chul's mistress was Lee Ma Ri,

693
00:38:54,071 --> 00:38:55,971
the foundation's son's wife.

694
00:38:56,031 --> 00:38:57,402
And he didn't report it.

695
00:38:58,801 --> 00:39:00,171
Ms. Lee Ma Ri had an affair...

696
00:39:00,172 --> 00:39:02,640
with the guy that was murdered at the hospital.

697
00:39:02,641 --> 00:39:04,240
I think that's why they are getting a divorce.

698
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:05,611
Did you know?

699
00:39:05,612 --> 00:39:07,212
No, I didn't.

700
00:39:07,652 --> 00:39:09,551
That is shocking.

701
00:39:10,882 --> 00:39:13,252
He even took pictures of them together...

702
00:39:13,352 --> 00:39:15,051
but received disciplinary action because he didn't report it.

703
00:39:15,522 --> 00:39:17,261
I think he'll be upset.

704
00:39:17,891 --> 00:39:18,962
Woo Ri.

705
00:39:26,031 --> 00:39:28,031
Woo Ri.

706
00:39:29,172 --> 00:39:30,541
Why did you lie about it?

707
00:39:30,542 --> 00:39:32,041
It's about an open case.

708
00:39:32,042 --> 00:39:33,370
I can't tell you everything.

709
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,571
Did you lie...

710
00:39:35,172 --> 00:39:37,582
because you thought I wouldn't hand over the baby?

711
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:41,781
Woo Ri.

712
00:39:42,451 --> 00:39:43,582
That's not it, right?

713
00:39:44,221 --> 00:39:45,621
That can't be.

714
00:39:45,752 --> 00:39:47,821
You can't lie.

715
00:39:51,462 --> 00:39:52,562
I'm sorry.

716
00:39:55,062 --> 00:39:56,491
It was my bad.

717
00:39:58,602 --> 00:40:01,172
So please, don't be upset.

718
00:40:09,141 --> 00:40:11,042
I'm not angry.

719
00:40:12,741 --> 00:40:14,482
I'm not mad at you.

720
00:40:16,681 --> 00:40:20,091
I don't know what I'm feeling right now,

721
00:40:22,422 --> 00:40:23,862
but I want to be alone.

722
00:40:39,871 --> 00:40:40,941
What was that?

723
00:40:40,942 --> 00:40:42,672
Was that Woo Ri just now?

724
00:40:43,781 --> 00:40:44,942
It was Woo Ri, right?

725
00:40:48,482 --> 00:40:49,681
Woo Ri.

726
00:40:50,422 --> 00:40:51,582
What's the matter?

727
00:40:51,681 --> 00:40:53,121
- Did something happen? - What is it?

728
00:40:53,522 --> 00:40:54,652
What's wrong?

729
00:40:57,192 --> 00:40:58,491
Stop crying!

730
00:40:59,022 --> 00:41:00,661
Calm down and tell us what happened.

731
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:02,632
Kang Jae...

732
00:41:03,701 --> 00:41:06,462
lied to me.

733
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:10,172
What should I do?

734
00:41:10,741 --> 00:41:13,870
Woo Ri, it's completely normal for couples to argue and fight.

735
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:15,172
I mean, it's only natural.

736
00:41:15,612 --> 00:41:17,482
You guys were the odd ones for never fighting.

737
00:41:17,582 --> 00:41:19,011
It's okay, Woo Ri.

738
00:41:19,141 --> 00:41:20,852
Did you two fight because he lied to you?

739
00:41:21,181 --> 00:41:23,181
Are you mad at him because you feel deceived?

740
00:41:25,382 --> 00:41:26,652
No.

741
00:41:27,321 --> 00:41:29,692
That's not why I'm upset.

742
00:41:30,091 --> 00:41:31,321
It's the opposite.

743
00:41:32,562 --> 00:41:35,232
I feel so bad for Kang Jae.

744
00:41:35,991 --> 00:41:39,062
He lied because of me.

745
00:41:39,301 --> 00:41:41,332
I feel horrible.

746
00:41:41,931 --> 00:41:46,571
I feel so bad that I don't even know what to do.

747
00:42:00,352 --> 00:42:02,922
You can't resolve this by just avoiding me like this.

748
00:42:03,051 --> 00:42:04,062
Sign the divorce papers now.

749
00:42:06,591 --> 00:42:07,890
I'm sorry,

750
00:42:07,891 --> 00:42:09,332
but I don't want to.

751
00:42:09,462 --> 00:42:11,931
If you refuse to sign the papers, I will sue you.

752
00:42:12,462 --> 00:42:13,800
Let's just get a divorce!

753
00:42:13,801 --> 00:42:15,970
If we let this go to court, it'll be very stressful.

754
00:42:15,971 --> 00:42:17,640
It'll bring out the worst in us,

755
00:42:17,641 --> 00:42:19,471
and it'll take a while for the case to be resolved.

756
00:42:19,641 --> 00:42:21,411
If the baby is born during the legal battle...

757
00:42:24,141 --> 00:42:26,281
Maybe I should sue you to get full custody of the baby.

758
00:42:28,951 --> 00:42:30,621
Have you really lost your mind?

759
00:42:31,652 --> 00:42:34,022
Just change your mind. That'd be much faster.

760
00:42:36,152 --> 00:42:38,292
Well, then...

761
00:42:39,192 --> 00:42:40,632
I'm off.

762
00:42:46,402 --> 00:42:47,571
How did it go?

763
00:42:47,632 --> 00:42:49,132
What do you think?

764
00:42:49,531 --> 00:42:52,902
Like you said, he has no choice but to follow my lead.

765
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:55,510
I've snatched up the steering wheel.

766
00:42:55,511 --> 00:42:56,881
Nice, that's great.

767
00:42:56,882 --> 00:42:58,711
Sounds like everything's going smoothly.

768
00:42:58,712 --> 00:43:00,752
Well done, my princess.

769
00:43:07,051 --> 00:43:08,591
Now, I just need him gone.

770
00:43:08,821 --> 00:43:10,091
One thing at a time.

771
00:43:11,091 --> 00:43:13,562
We must get rid of those who should be gone.

772
00:43:14,431 --> 00:43:15,591
Get rid of him?

773
00:43:16,332 --> 00:43:17,502
Mom.

774
00:43:20,232 --> 00:43:21,301
Can you do it?

775
00:43:22,071 --> 00:43:24,772
The first time won't be easy for anyone.

776
00:43:25,571 --> 00:43:26,812
However,

777
00:43:27,942 --> 00:43:29,870
if it must be done,

778
00:43:29,871 --> 00:43:32,011
anyone can and will do it.

779
00:43:44,792 --> 00:43:45,922
Is this your relative's place?

780
00:43:46,321 --> 00:43:48,632
How... How did you find me here?

781
00:43:50,602 --> 00:43:52,031
Seriously, don't be like this.

782
00:43:52,761 --> 00:43:54,632
I'm afraid I'd turn into you at this rate.

(Consensual Divorce Intention Confirmation Document)

784

785
00:43:59,942 --> 00:44:01,171
Darn it.

786
00:44:01,172 --> 00:44:02,411
Seriously!

787
00:44:07,752 --> 00:44:08,911
You little...

788
00:44:09,712 --> 00:44:12,252
- Help! - Shut it!

789
00:44:14,221 --> 00:44:15,391
What's that sound?

790
00:44:16,221 --> 00:44:18,291
What? I didn't hear anything.

791
00:44:18,292 --> 00:44:19,760
Didn't someone call out for help...

792
00:44:19,761 --> 00:44:20,961
What are you talking about?

793
00:44:20,962 --> 00:44:22,431
I didn't hear anything.

794
00:44:24,031 --> 00:44:25,502
Help!

795
00:44:25,632 --> 00:44:26,800
- See? I heard it again... - No!

796
00:44:26,801 --> 00:44:28,831
It's the TV.

797
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:29,870
No, just now...

798
00:44:29,871 --> 00:44:32,141
Seriously! What's the matter with you?

799
00:44:32,641 --> 00:44:33,871
Hey, what's with you?

800
00:44:34,141 --> 00:44:35,910
Let's talk inside. Who else is home with you?

801
00:44:35,911 --> 00:44:38,640
No one! It's just me.

802
00:44:38,641 --> 00:44:40,482
- Let's talk inside. - Gosh, seriously!

803
00:44:40,911 --> 00:44:42,180
Give me that.

806
00:44:46,652 --> 00:44:47,852
Leave!

807
00:45:00,832 --> 00:45:01,931
Did he leave?

808

Park Du Pal! It's all your fault!

809

Mom, what do I do?

810
00:45:07,971 --> 00:45:10,441
- Did he find out? - I'm doomed now.

811
00:45:10,442 --> 00:45:12,911
I signed the divorce papers!

812
00:45:13,042 --> 00:45:14,652
Why did you do that?

813
00:45:15,681 --> 00:45:16,951

814
00:45:20,991 --> 00:45:22,890
You moron!

815
00:45:22,891 --> 00:45:25,792
You ruined everything!

819
00:46:18,582 --> 00:46:20,281
Hello, sir.

820
00:46:23,882 --> 00:46:27,321
Is it something you can't tell me over the phone?

821
00:46:29,652 --> 00:46:30,721
Oh, really?

822
00:46:32,062 --> 00:46:33,221
Come on in.

823
00:46:34,031 --> 00:46:35,530
But why...

824
00:46:35,531 --> 00:46:37,701
This way. This will only take a moment.

825
00:46:40,301 --> 00:46:41,902
- It's this room here. - Okay.

826
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:44,571
Come in.

827
00:46:48,212 --> 00:46:50,011
I wanted to show you this room.

828
00:46:50,241 --> 00:46:52,281
It's so cute!

829
00:46:53,082 --> 00:46:54,652
I decorated the room myself.

830
00:46:54,911 --> 00:46:57,421
Every day after work, I went shopping to buy things one by one...

831
00:46:57,422 --> 00:46:58,551
and decorated the room.

832
00:46:59,022 --> 00:47:00,721
I did everything myself.

833
00:47:02,252 --> 00:47:04,220
This must've been a lot of work.

834
00:47:04,221 --> 00:47:06,462
You did an amazing job.

835
00:47:08,491 --> 00:47:09,632
Ms. Oh.

836
00:47:10,502 --> 00:47:11,732
My wife and I got a divorce.

837
00:47:12,562 --> 00:47:14,632
But I made the decision for the baby's sake.

838
00:47:15,502 --> 00:47:18,341
I promise you that I'll create the best environment for the baby.

839
00:47:18,741 --> 00:47:20,341
I will make sure to build an environment...

840
00:47:20,971 --> 00:47:23,982
that's much better than the one my wife and I could've given the child.

841
00:47:25,482 --> 00:47:26,612
Okay.

842
00:47:28,482 --> 00:47:29,812
I'll do my best too.

843
00:47:33,582 --> 00:47:34,692
Look at this.

844
00:47:36,221 --> 00:47:37,522
It's so cute!

845
00:47:42,161 --> 00:47:43,832
You should see this too.

846
00:48:08,591 --> 00:48:10,522
- Hi, Kang Jae. - Hey, Woo Ri.

847
00:48:11,321 --> 00:48:12,591
Can you talk now?

848
00:48:12,721 --> 00:48:14,631
- Yes. - Great.

849
00:48:14,632 --> 00:48:16,792
- What were you up to? - Me?

850
00:48:17,362 --> 00:48:18,502
I was...

851
00:48:19,002 --> 00:48:21,902
I came out to do some research.

852
00:48:23,102 --> 00:48:25,071
I see. Well...

853
00:48:25,741 --> 00:48:27,212
Are you free this evening?

854
00:48:28,411 --> 00:48:29,570
Can we meet and talk?

855
00:48:29,571 --> 00:48:31,841
What? Sure.

856
00:48:32,982 --> 00:48:34,212
I'll call you when I get off.

857
00:48:34,781 --> 00:48:35,882
Okay.

858
00:48:43,862 --> 00:48:44,922
Woo Ri.

859
00:48:46,792 --> 00:48:47,931
Do you want a ride?

860
00:48:50,232 --> 00:48:51,602
I'm going to take the subway.

861
00:48:55,971 --> 00:48:57,841
Let's talk.

862
00:48:57,942 --> 00:48:59,741
I have nothing to say to you.

863
00:49:00,471 --> 00:49:01,641
Why?

864
00:49:01,911 --> 00:49:03,411
Because it's my fault that we split up?

865
00:49:03,942 --> 00:49:05,281
So you don't even want to talk?

866
00:49:10,352 --> 00:49:12,050
You said you wanted the baby.

867
00:49:12,051 --> 00:49:14,192
You said you were desperate. So why did you do that?

868
00:49:14,652 --> 00:49:15,852
Woo Ri.

869
00:49:16,522 --> 00:49:18,521
Don't run your mouth if you don't know what's going on.

870
00:49:18,522 --> 00:49:20,491
You cheated on your husband and faked an assault.

871
00:49:20,862 --> 00:49:23,031
You said you wanted the baby. Was it all an act?

872
00:49:24,402 --> 00:49:25,562
An act?

873
00:49:26,201 --> 00:49:27,902
This is ridiculous.

874
00:49:28,531 --> 00:49:30,502
Clearly, you don't know who's putting on an act.

875
00:49:30,902 --> 00:49:32,002
Hey.

876
00:49:33,042 --> 00:49:35,612
I bet you don't know that your boyfriend helped me.

877
00:49:36,241 --> 00:49:37,812
Lee Kang Jae...

878
00:49:37,882 --> 00:49:40,712
covered it up, fully knowing that I had an affair with No Man Chul.

879
00:49:41,951 --> 00:49:43,050
What did you say?

880
00:49:43,051 --> 00:49:44,582
Of course, you didn't know.

881
00:49:44,752 --> 00:49:46,551
I heard he didn't even tell his higher-ups.

882
00:49:46,882 --> 00:49:48,821
Why do you think he did that?

883
00:49:49,292 --> 00:49:51,160
Obviously, he was afraid...

884
00:49:51,161 --> 00:49:53,721
he'd have to raise the child should you decide to keep it.

885
00:49:54,562 --> 00:49:56,891
I guess he really didn't want to raise the child.

886
00:49:58,862 --> 00:50:00,002
Are you surprised?

887
00:50:01,272 --> 00:50:04,002
See? He's the one who got you real good.

888
00:50:05,272 --> 00:50:06,602
What a relief.

889
00:50:07,971 --> 00:50:09,071
What?

890
00:50:10,582 --> 00:50:13,281
I'm truly relieved that my baby...

891
00:50:14,482 --> 00:50:16,051
will not have a mother like you.

892
00:50:19,582 --> 00:50:20,891
That little...

893
00:50:23,121 --> 00:50:24,161
Darn it.

894
00:51:01,161 --> 00:51:02,261
Woo Ri.

895
00:51:04,661 --> 00:51:05,902
I'm sorry.

896
00:51:07,801 --> 00:51:09,602
I should've been honest with you.

897
00:51:12,241 --> 00:51:14,612
I was just being a coward. I guess I'm scared.

898
00:51:16,641 --> 00:51:18,442
You see, if you end up raising the baby,

899
00:51:19,612 --> 00:51:22,181
all our promises and plans...

900
00:51:24,582 --> 00:51:26,752
We wouldn't be able to do any of that, and I didn't like it.

901
00:51:29,022 --> 00:51:30,692
That's why I couldn't tell you.

902
00:51:37,402 --> 00:51:39,531
We never kept secrets from each other.

903
00:51:41,402 --> 00:51:43,801
And before this, I had never once lied to you.

904
00:51:47,542 --> 00:51:49,011
What happened to us?

905
00:51:53,141 --> 00:51:54,582
It's all my fault.

906
00:52:00,281 --> 00:52:01,491
I'm sorry.

907
00:52:02,852 --> 00:52:04,962
I'm sorry, Woo Ri. I should've been more thoughtful.

908
00:52:06,292 --> 00:52:07,491
Why do you...

909
00:52:09,661 --> 00:52:11,701
always say that everything's your fault?

910
00:52:13,902 --> 00:52:15,971
You did nothing wrong.

911
00:52:17,102 --> 00:52:19,301
Why are you saying it's your fault?

912
00:52:27,911 --> 00:52:29,652
You know,

913
00:52:30,951 --> 00:52:32,922
we're supposed to take pictures together tomorrow.

914
00:52:35,551 --> 00:52:37,152
Let's only take happy pictures from now on.

915
00:53:27,102 --> 00:53:28,312
You're here again?

916
00:53:29,241 --> 00:53:30,612
What's with the flowers?

917
00:53:31,382 --> 00:53:32,442
Oh, this.

918
00:53:33,582 --> 00:53:34,812
Are you here alone?

919
00:53:35,482 --> 00:53:37,482
My, you look stunning today.

920
00:53:40,382 --> 00:53:43,051
I thought long and hard before coming here today.

921
00:53:44,161 --> 00:53:45,261
About what?

922
00:53:48,091 --> 00:53:50,031
I like you a lot.

923
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:54,470
From the time when you were the Uhm Jung Hwa of Bukgajwa-dong...

924
00:53:54,471 --> 00:53:55,732
back in middle school...

925
00:53:56,931 --> 00:54:00,301
to now, as the mother of my child 30 years later.

926
00:54:01,542 --> 00:54:04,442
I have liked you every single moment all through the years.

927
00:54:07,341 --> 00:54:08,482
Let's...

928
00:54:09,681 --> 00:54:11,121
get back together.

929
00:54:13,882 --> 00:54:15,152
Seoung Il.

930
00:54:17,491 --> 00:54:18,591
I'm sorry.

931
00:54:19,962 --> 00:54:21,031
What?

932
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:22,732
I don't think I can do it.

933
00:54:22,792 --> 00:54:24,502
Why not?

934
00:54:25,562 --> 00:54:27,102
I've also thought a lot...

935
00:54:27,232 --> 00:54:29,772
about what we should do.

936
00:54:30,332 --> 00:54:33,502
But you see, my longest relationship only lasted six months.

937
00:54:33,772 --> 00:54:35,511
I've never been in a long-term relationship.

938
00:54:36,272 --> 00:54:37,811
So if we do this, and if it doesn't work out...

939
00:54:37,812 --> 00:54:41,211
Why worry about it not working out when it hasn't even begun?

940
00:54:41,212 --> 00:54:42,280
That's not right.

941
00:54:42,281 --> 00:54:44,221
Anyway, okay.

942
00:54:44,951 --> 00:54:48,191
I promise you that I'll make you and Woo Ri happy.

943
00:54:48,192 --> 00:54:49,950
I'm confident, so let's do it.

944
00:54:49,951 --> 00:54:51,991
It may work out, or it may not.

945
00:54:52,692 --> 00:54:54,590
I mean, I understand...

946
00:54:54,591 --> 00:54:57,031
we'll be hurt if things go wrong. And that's okay.

947
00:54:57,292 --> 00:54:59,531
But what about Woo Ri?

948
00:55:00,201 --> 00:55:02,732
- What about her? - If it doesn't work out,

949
00:55:03,672 --> 00:55:06,371
my daughter will be hurt, yet again.

950
00:55:07,141 --> 00:55:10,312
It's too big a gamble, and I can't do it.

951

(Oh Eun Ran's Smile Singing School)

952
00:55:36,902 --> 00:55:39,942
Could you fix your hair right here?

953
00:55:41,071 --> 00:55:42,471
Oh, it's probably this right here.

954
00:55:43,542 --> 00:55:46,382
- Better? - No, the other side.

955
00:55:47,241 --> 00:55:49,612
Woo Ri, you should check it in the mirror. Hold on.

956
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:54,391
Here, check.

957
00:55:57,152 --> 00:55:58,192
Better?

958
00:55:59,821 --> 00:56:02,192
- Okay, it's fixed. - Great.

959
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:10,531
- We're ready. - Okay.

960
00:56:10,801 --> 00:56:12,402
All right, let's take some shots now.

961
00:56:13,571 --> 00:56:14,772
Here we go!

962
00:56:15,971 --> 00:56:18,212
In 1, 2.

963
00:56:19,112 --> 00:56:21,252
Nice. One more time.

964
00:56:22,482 --> 00:56:25,582
Well, could you smile a little more?

965
00:56:30,591 --> 00:56:31,591
Smile.

966
00:56:41,272 --> 00:56:42,531
Are you all right?

967
00:56:48,042 --> 00:56:49,571
I'm sorry.

968
00:56:50,312 --> 00:56:51,312
Woo Ri.

Woo Ri.

971
00:56:55,451 --> 00:56:56,482
Woo Ri, wait.

972
00:56:57,152 --> 00:56:59,181
What's wrong, all of a sudden? Did something happen?

973
00:56:59,951 --> 00:57:00,991
Kang Jae.

974
00:57:03,121 --> 00:57:04,661
Let's end it here.

975
00:57:07,522 --> 00:57:08,832
End what?

976
00:57:10,732 --> 00:57:12,531
I thought long and hard.

977
00:57:13,862 --> 00:57:15,132
Let's break up.

978
00:57:16,371 --> 00:57:18,741
What are you talking about all of a sudden?

979
00:57:18,801 --> 00:57:21,070
I keep thinking of the moment when you lied to me,

980
00:57:21,071 --> 00:57:24,172
so I can't believe anything you say.

981
00:57:25,641 --> 00:57:26,681
I'm sorry.

982
00:57:27,241 --> 00:57:28,812
I won't lie to you ever again. I promise, Woo Ri.

983
00:57:29,852 --> 00:57:32,252
It's better this way for you too.

984
00:57:34,022 --> 00:57:36,022
This way, I won't ruin your life.

985
00:57:37,862 --> 00:57:40,022
You should've told me that you really didn't want me...

986
00:57:40,891 --> 00:57:41,930
to keep the baby.

987
00:57:41,931 --> 00:57:44,300
I did think that for a moment, but I was wrong.

988
00:57:44,301 --> 00:57:45,801
I don't think that anymore, Woo Ri.

989
00:57:45,902 --> 00:57:47,632
Human emotion is a funny thing.

990
00:57:48,571 --> 00:57:50,272
Suddenly, I can't even stand the sight of you.

991
00:57:52,641 --> 00:57:53,942
Let's break up.

992
00:58:17,292 --> 00:58:18,332
Hey.

993
00:58:20,832 --> 00:58:22,232
If you really mean it,

994
00:58:23,332 --> 00:58:24,641
look me in the eye and say it.

995
00:58:27,301 --> 00:58:29,341
Look me straight in the eye and say it.

996
00:58:36,082 --> 00:58:37,482
We're over.

997
00:58:40,681 --> 00:58:41,852
I mean it.

00:59:38,011 --> 00:59:40,582
I heard a mother's emotions are transferred to her baby.

1001
00:59:40,911 --> 00:59:42,410
We should catch the one he's meeting.

1002
00:59:42,411 --> 00:59:43,581
I'll go get it.

1003
00:59:43,582 --> 00:59:45,280
I'll throw the hospital upside down.

1004
00:59:45,281 --> 00:59:46,981
- What did you say? - What is all this?

1005
00:59:46,982 --> 00:59:49,152
You seem to be having a hard time. I want to help.

1006
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:50,652
Why do we have to be like this?

1007
00:59:50,792 --> 00:59:53,220
- She could miscarry the baby. - A miscarriage?

1008
00:59:53,221 --> 00:59:56,131
I feel so bad for Kang Jae.

1009
00:59:56,132 --> 00:59:57,931
Should we just not do this?

1010
01:00:02,272 --> 01:00:06,272
