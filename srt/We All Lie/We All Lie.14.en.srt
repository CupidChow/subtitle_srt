00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,360
If you kowtow to me,

191
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,300
maybe

192
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,930
I'll just consider cutting you some slack.

193
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,230
Everyone,

194
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,660
I'm here

195
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:22,000
to seek justice for myself.

196
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,460
If this never happened,

197
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,700
Su Li would probably never see me again.

198
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,760
Don't be fooled, guys.

199
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,700
The man in the photos is a scriptwriter

200
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,400
in Su Li's company.

201
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,060
He has no experience in script writing,

202
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,400
but gets to participate
in a renowned scriptwriter team.

203
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,860
I would like to ask Ms. Su,

204
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:41,400
what's it that she sees in him.

205
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,960
I don't need you to meddle

206
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,200
in the hiring process at my company.

207
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,130
Is his good look what you see in him?

208
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,130
Everyone,

209
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:57,400
since the news about Su Li came out,

210
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,730
I have something to get off my chest too.

211
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,460
Actually Su Li cheated on Zhang Shuheng
during their marriage.

212
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,460
Gosh. I don't believe that.

213
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,200
The first minute she divorced,

214
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,360
the man was hired the next minute.

215
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:12,700
Do you mean that Zhang Shuheng
and Su Li both cheated

216
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,860
on each other?

217
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,400
I didn't have an affair
with Zhang Shuheng.

218
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,060
It was Su Li

219
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,460
who cheated on Zhang Shuheng,

220
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,600
and when he caught her cheating,
she switched the blame.

221
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:29,130
Just because she has high status
in our industry

222
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:29,730
and more resources,

223
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,000
she blamed it

224
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,400
on me,

225
00:13:36,730 --> 00:13:38,360
who used to be her bestie.

226
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,330
She also threatened us.

227
00:13:40,130 --> 00:13:41,660
If we didn't take the blame,

228
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:44,730
she would make sure we never got a job
in the industry.

229
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:46,160
We swallowed insult
and humiliation silently,

230
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:49,260
so she grabbed the chance

231
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,130
to make herself look like

232
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:52,330
a perfect victim.

233
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,500
Zhang Shuheng's lying in the hospital.

234
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,800
Now he's a vegetable.

235
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:00,060
Maybe Su Li is behind it too.

236
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,100
Luckily,

237
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,000
justice is on my side.

238
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:14,530
Their cheating scandal is all out
in the open.

239
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,560
I have no fear.

240
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:19,530
Making compromises

241
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,800
will only abet bad people
to do worse things.

242
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,130
It's nonsense!

243
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,730
Don't trust her.

244
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:29,130
I didn't cheat.

245
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,060
The photos are fake.

246
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,260
I never took any.

247
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,460
Really?

248
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,100
Then you mean you did sleep

249
00:14:38,730 --> 00:14:39,800
with the man in the photos.

250
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:42,100
The photos were taken by someone else.

251
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,160
If you have one ounce of guilt,

252
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,000
you should be speechless.

253
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,300
Ms. Su, that's what you mean, right?

254
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,760
I'm not the woman in the photos.

255
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,930
It's a setup.

256
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:02,400
Will you swear

257
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,200
that everything you say is true?

258
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,360
Of course.

259
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:10,200
I, Chen Yingying, swear,

260
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:11,360

261

262
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,500
I'll have a horrible end.

263
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:31,660
Fine.

what your end will be.

00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:14,800
Why did you stop taking photos?

267
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:17,860
Why did you betray me?

00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,700
I let you see the document on purpose.

please act on your vows.

What I despise the most about you

326
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,350
is how you look down on others

327

is something you toss away

00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,380
To act well,

335
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:45,550
to make money through acting,

336
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:48,380
I had to wear thick clothes in summer

337
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:50,410
and get into cold water in winter.

Everything I have today

347
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:17,010
is earned through hard work

step by step.

349
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,150
How impressive.

350
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:25,450
If you're so good,

351
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:27,050
why can't you keep your baby?

about your miscarriage.

particularly miserable lately?

I can't go to jail.

374
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:47,150
I can't go to jail.

I can't.

00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,750
I can't survive in prison.

377
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:51,580
I can't go to jail.

378
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:39,310
Luckily, you're not hurt,

379
00:22:39,310 --> 00:22:40,410
Su Li.

380
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:42,710
I meant to go with you the other day,

381
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:44,850
but you told me you had plans.

382
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:46,850
You scared me.

383
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:49,050
It's lucky Wang Weide chose
 to do the right thing.

384
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,150
Don't stress.

385
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:55,150
Don't you know me?

386
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:56,180
Who can deceive me?

387
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:01,650
Ms. Su,

388
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:02,450
Mr. Qian's here.

389
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:03,950
Mr. Qian.

390
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:10,110
Ganggang,

391
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:10,750
please step out for a second.

392
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:11,650
I'll have a chat with Mr. Qian.

393
00:23:17,650 --> 00:23:17,980
Take a seat.

394
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:18,380
Please.

395
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,150
I'm aware of what you told me.

396
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:35,510
Let's stay in touch.

397
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:37,380
Okay, sure.

398
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:37,780
Well,

399
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:40,710
it's like what I told you.

400
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:41,450
I'll head out.

401
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:46,180
Right,

402
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:47,950
the parking lot attendant told me

403
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:48,410
I have to fill

404
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:50,010
in visitor information when I leave.

405
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:50,980
I'm not sure how.

406
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:53,110
May I ask Ganggang to help me out?

407
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:53,710
Ganggang,

408
00:23:54,410 --> 00:23:55,150
see Mr. Qian off.

409
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:56,450
Okay.

410
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:01,650
This way, Mr. Qian.

411
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:09,710
Please.

412
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:18,180
What're you doing here?

413
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,050
Relax.

414
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:24,010
I'm here to have a small talk with Su Li.

415
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:24,510
Only

416
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:25,780
if you don't return

417
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,780
my money within this week,

418
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:28,710
I'll talk real business

419
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:30,010
with her the next time.

420
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,820
[Su Li]

421
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:57,610
Are you feeling well?

422
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:03,050
You're very lucky.

423
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:03,950
The wound isn't too deep.

424
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:05,380
Be careful

425
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:06,310
and don't touch the wound.

426
00:25:06,310 --> 00:25:06,950
It'll recover soon.

427
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:18,980
The flower wasn't here before I came in.

428
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,520
Who sent it?

429
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,550
Why didn't they come in?

430
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:27,720
Where are you going?

431
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,920
You're supposed to rest.

432
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:31,880
Su Li!

433
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,580
Why didn't you come in?

434
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,920
I asked the doctor about you.

435
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,620
I knew you're fine.

436
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,500
And then I felt relieved.

437
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,500
It didn't matter whether I came in or not.

438
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,970
It matters to me.

439
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,340
I owe you something
that I never have a chance to tell you.

440
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,240
I'm sorry.

441
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:04,900
I lied to you

442
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,140
for money.

443
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,170
I'm sorry, while you were drunk,

444
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,800
I ever thought of taking a picture of you.

445
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:14,570
I'm sorry

446
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:20,140
I approached you with ulterior motives.

447
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:23,770
I deceived you.

448
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:28,970
It's okay.

449
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,900
At least you knew when to quit.

450
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:34,640
I only hope

451
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,900
you won't lie to someone else

452
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,170
for money.

453
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:43,970
I won't.

454
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:46,700
I lied to you and I lied to myself.

455
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,770
I lied to myself

456
00:26:50,770 --> 00:26:51,800
that I could get my feelings
for you in check.

457
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:52,170
But

458
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,640
I found out I couldn't.

459
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:04,340
I really regret it.

460
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,440
Can you please give me another chance?

461
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,300
You meet the wrong person

462
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,400
at the wrong time.

463
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,340
It's a mistake.

464
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,100
Don't make further mistakes.

465
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,140
May I ask you a question?

466
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,840
Have you ever liked me?

467
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:53,570
Even for a moment.

468
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:33,570
You're home.

469
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:34,570
Yeah.

470
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:38,440
It's pouring out there.

471
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,570
You should tell me you're coming home.

472
00:28:39,570 --> 00:28:40,300
I can pick you up.

473
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:41,840
What's with your shoes?

474
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,840
There was a puddle.

475
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:47,500
A car came by

476
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,340
and I wasn't looking.

477
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,370
It splashed the mud all over me.

478
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:51,170
Take off your shoes and I'll wash them.

479
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:52,200
It's okay.

480
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:52,600
I'm no bother.

481
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:58,240
It's hard to get white shoes clean

482
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,600
once they get dirty.

483
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:07,570
Here.

484
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:11,440
Honey,

485
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,200
I've thought it through.

486
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:15,200
You're right.

487
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,170
Let's leave this city.

488
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:17,800
Really?

489
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:19,100
Yes.

490
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,000
Why suddenly change your mind?

491
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,240
The things I did

492
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,570
couldn't be kept a secret any longer.

493
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,340
When do we leave?

494
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,100
The sooner the better.

495
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:34,740
I see.

496
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,840
But for the sake of our happiness
in the future,

497
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,740
we do need some more money.

498
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,400
I'll get it soon.

499
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:52,940
