Ms. Su,

28
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:27,960
at 2:00 PM,

29
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,060
you have a meeting with Mr. Wang
from Yaoshi Films.

30
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:31,720
At 4:00 PM, there's a script meeting
with Mr. Shen.

31
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,290
At 5:00 PM,

32
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,320
you have dinner with the producer
from Mr. Sun's company.

33
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,360
A one-hour script meeting may not

34
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,960
be enough
to cover the investment discussion.

35
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,360
Help me reschedule the dinner
for tomorrow.

36
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:42,920
But the dinner

37
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,920
with the producer was planned in advance.

38
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,560
Making last-minute changes
might not be a good idea.

39
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,460
How about this?

40
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,720
Why don't I go instead?

41
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,090
Most of the matters were covered
in early discussion with Mr. Sun.

42
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,090
Only some details
about the contract are left.

43
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:53,860
I can do it.

44
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,120
Alright,

45
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,160
you can go on my behalf.

46
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,320
Please convey my apologies.

47
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,860
Sure.

48
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:00,760
I'll head out now.

49
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,260
Okay.

50
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:04,490
Ganggang,

51
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:10,890
yesterday,

52
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:12,690
did those debt collectors come to you?

53
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:14,820
No, they didn't.

54
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:16,620
That's good.

55
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:18,920
If they do come to you,

56
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,490
you must call the police immediately;

57
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:21,690
otherwise, it could be dangerous.

58
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:23,660
No.

59
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,420
I think

60
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,120
you should divorce Shen Charen now.

61
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:26,960
You have no idea

62
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,060
that they came to the company yesterday...

63
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,360
I'm sorry for the trouble yesterday.

64
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,420
It's okay.

65
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,520
I can handle the rest on my own.

66
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,960
Just be careful.

67
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:46,520
I'll head out now.

68
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,160
Ganggang,

69
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,160
so you like visiting art galleries.

70
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:06,860
You have great taste.

71
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,720
I'm flattered.

72
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:11,760
I just find it peaceful here.

73
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,520
You know,

74
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:20,260
if only human hearts could be
as hard as stones,

75
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,120
then we wouldn't be disappointed or hurt.

76
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,220
Alright,

77
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,520
let's get back to business.

78
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:29,090
About the contract,

79
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:30,690
we don't have any issues,

80
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:31,760
so we can proceed

81
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:33,560
with the offline signing process.

82
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:36,120
You sure don't have any problems,

83
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,960
but I have a lot on my plate.

84
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:38,490
Well,

85
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,220
how upsetting.

86
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:41,620
What's bothering you?

87
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,490
Ms. Su is thinking of partnering
with a more powerful

88
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:50,820
and resourceful investor for this project,

89
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,890
as a preparation
for establishing a production company

90
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:53,960
in the future,

91
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,260
with a big company like Huazhong.

92
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,360
What's with the change of heart?

93
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:00,490
We've come this far

94
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:02,460
and you can't just back out.

95
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,920
It lacks a spirit of contract.

96
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,290
We haven't signed a contract,

97
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:07,960
so there's no loss for you guys.

98
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,260
Ms. Su doesn't mind.

99
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:15,020
Ganggang,

100
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,660
how about

101
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,520
you have another word with Ms. Su?

102
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,320
We are sincere

103
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,290
and hope to cooperate with Ms. Su.

104
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:25,920
As to any other requirements,

105
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,960
we can talk about them over a cup of tea.

106
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:29,620
Besides,

107
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:31,920
I've been following up this project
for almost a year.

108
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,060
If this falls through,

109
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,360
I might as well quit.

110
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,720
I actually feel for you.

111
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,160
Managing a project is not easy.

112
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:42,620
But

113
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:45,360
you could make millions striking a deal.

114
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,160
Where does that leave me?

115
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,860
I still get paid thousands a month.

116
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,720
Earning peanuts but carrying the weight
of the world.

117
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,460
On the professional front,

118
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,090
I'm all about fighting
for the company's interests

119
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,320
and looking out for Ms. Su.

120
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,020
But on a personal level,

121
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,060
I'm just not really what's in it for me.

122
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,060
Rest assured.

123
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:03,620
Ganggang,

124
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,920
your hard work won't go unrewarded.

125
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:09,760
I really appreciate it.

126
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:12,620
Although

127
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,960
Ms. Su thinks of me like her own sister,

128
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:16,760
so let me try.

129
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:17,760
Alright.

130
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,520
I suddenly feel hungry.

131
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,360
Shall we go grab a meal?

132
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,620
Sure, my treat.

133
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,090
It's you?

134
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:04,890
A friend took me

135
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:05,960
to a really nice restaurant.

136
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,560
For some reason, I thought of you,

137
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:09,420
so I got some takeout for you

138
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:09,920
as a late-night snack.

139
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:11,690
I already had dinner.

140
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,460
You know why experts recommend

141
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,690
eating seven-tenths full for dinner?

142
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:18,490
It's for health.

143
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:22,490
It's because the remaining can be saved
for a late-night snack.

144
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,060
Well...

145
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:26,890
I'm a bit thirsty.

146
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:27,490
Could you invite me in

147
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:28,660
for some water?

148
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,090
Sure, come on in.

149
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:52,720
The flowers are quite beautiful.

150
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,660
I have a question to ask you.

151
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:02,220
You must answer honestly.

152
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,660
Do you like me?

153
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,620
You're being quite straightforward,
making me blush.

154
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,520
Yes, that's right.

155
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,490
I like you

156
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:16,490
and want to pursue you.

157
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:25,290
I just got out of a failed marriage,

158
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:27,620
so I'm not looking
to start a new relationship right now.

159
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,820
If you want to pursue me,

160
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,320
you might want to cut your losses.

161
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,120
I haven't even tried yet

162
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,360
and you're already discouraging me.

163
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:36,360
Something can indeed be achieved
through effort,

164
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,460
but when it comes to relationships,

165
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,720
effort doesn't guarantee success.

166
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:43,160
If it's not the right person,

167
00:08:43,160 --> 00:08:45,520
no matter how hard you try,

168
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,620
it'll be in vain.

169
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:50,120
I have learned
about your past relationship.

170
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,260
Please don't misunderstand.

171
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,760
I'm not intentionally prying
into your privacy.

172
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,490
It's mainly because

173
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,490
your news has been
all over the internet lately.

174
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:03,520
It's fine.

175
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:05,760
It's all water under the bridge.

176
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,660
Just because
you have one failed relationship

177
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,890
doesn't mean you should lock yourself up

178
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:15,020
and say no to everyone.

179
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,460
You haven't even tried,

180
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,290
so how do you know
if I'm the right person or not?

181
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:23,520
My attitude towards relationships now is

182
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,120
to go with the flow.

183
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,920
If life gives me honey,

184
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,460
I'll enjoy it.

185
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,920
If it gives me hardships,

186
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,320
I'll face them head-on.

187
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:37,360
I just...

188
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,460
I just no longer have expectations

189
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:44,820
because

190
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,260
having expectations leads

191
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,290
to compromise.

192
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,490
I'm no longer an 18-year-old girl.

193
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:58,720
I believe

194
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,460
going with the flow

195
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,740
is accepting the consequence
after giving my best effort,

196
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:06,290
rather than doing nothing with a shrug.

197
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:07,760
Although I was turned down today,

198
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,760
I won't give up.

199
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,760
I believe effort will be rewarded.

200
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,490
You're right,

201
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:16,090
effort will be rewarded.

202
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,090
You see,

203
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,090
you made an effort,

204
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:21,720
but all you got from me was hurt.

205
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,860
Let me get you some water.

206
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,380
What do you want to eat?

207
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,060
I can make something for you.

208
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:47,740
Honey,

209
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,710
don't bother.

210
00:10:49,710 --> 00:10:50,510
Take a rest.

211
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:00,710
Here's some money.

212
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,710
Use it to pay off debts first.

213
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:07,570
This...

214
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:11,410
Where did you get this money?

215
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:16,410
It's from work.

216
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:26,570
Honey,

217
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:28,470
thank you.

218
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:49,510
Here's the budget sheet
for the next project.

219
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:50,610
Please give it to Gu Lan.

220
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,410
Have her compare
several production companies

221
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:54,070
to see which one offers the best quote.

222
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:56,270
Ms. Su,

223
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:58,870
could you assign this project to me?

224
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:01,010
I want to work on more projects

225
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:02,340
and learn more

226
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,370
to better assist you in the future.

227
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,510
Sure, no problem at all.

228
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:09,210
I'm just a bit surprised

229
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:11,410
because you've been somewhat resist

230
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:13,270
this kind of liaison work

231
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,870
in the past.

232
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:15,940
I didn't expect

233
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,770
you to volunteer for it.

234
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,470
I was pushed into it by you, after all.

235
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:29,340
What I mean is,

236
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:32,010
since I have such an excellent boss
like you,

237
00:12:32,010 --> 00:12:33,410
if I don't improve myself,

238
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:34,870
how can I be a good assistant to you?

239
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:39,510
You can talk me up more
if you know how.

240
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:36,970
You stalking me?

241
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:39,410
I just like you. I'm not a stalker.

242
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:40,710
I happened to be here for some business,

243
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:41,470
then I happened to see you.

244
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:43,710
Let me give you some advice.

245
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:46,010
For someone who keeps saying
"I like you",

246
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:48,170
his love will be seen as cheap.

247
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:51,310
Allow me to explain.

248
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:52,470
First of all,

249
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:54,370
I don't habitually say "I like you".

250
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:55,970
I'm only saying it to you.

251
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,770
Second,

252
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,910
if you don't express your feelings,

253
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,910
keeping them bottled up inside
feels awful.

254
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:02,470
Isn't it?

255
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:06,070
Well, that's greasy.

256
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:10,070
Well, if you don't like it,

257
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:11,570
I can phrase it differently.

258
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:12,570
Actually, I think,

259
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:13,970
that night,

260
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:15,370
I already made it clear to you.

261
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:17,010
Yes,

262
00:14:17,010 --> 00:14:18,210
you turned me down.

263
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:18,710
But

264
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:21,710
I should still have the right
to pursue you, right?

265
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:22,340
It's fine.

266
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,210
You don't need to feel burdened.

267
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:25,370
I won't ask you to take responsibility.

268
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:27,310
I have no burden.

269
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:50,670
Didn't you say you had something to do?

270
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,010
I just happened to go your way.

271
00:15:18,070 --> 00:15:18,810
Happened to go your way.

272
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:27,110
It's really a coincidence.

273
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:28,270
Quite a coincidence.

274
00:15:28,270 --> 00:15:29,510
Well,

275
00:15:29,510 --> 00:15:30,170
you also work upstairs?

276
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,070
Ms. Su.

277
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:37,170
Has the interviewee arrived?

278
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:39,010
He has.

279
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:42,470
I wasn't lying to you;

280
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:43,810
it really was on my way.

281
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,110
I'm actually here for the interview.
My name's Weide.

282
00:15:58,070 --> 00:15:59,370
Mr. Wang Weide,

283
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:01,370
unfortunately you don't meet
our requirements.

284
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:02,370
Please leave.

285
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:04,810
Come on.

286
00:16:04,810 --> 00:16:06,140
Aged 18 to 30,

287
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:07,370
bachelor's degree,

288
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:08,370
passion for the film
and television industry,

289
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:09,410
enthusiastic for work,

290
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,670
I meet all these criteria.

291
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:12,910
I'm looking for an assistant

292
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:14,870
who is genuinely here to work and learn,

293
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:15,910
not someone

294
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,570
with ulterior motives.

295
00:16:17,570 --> 00:16:19,770
I'm genuinely here to work and learn.

296
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,570
I applied after thoroughly researching

297
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:22,470
your company.

298
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:23,270
Then tell me,

299
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,570
what have you learned about us?

300
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:31,770
You.

301
00:16:33,070 --> 00:16:34,070
I researched you.

302
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:37,010
I know you're the vice president
of the Scriptwriters' Association,

303
00:16:37,010 --> 00:16:38,170
graduated from Communication University.

304
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:40,410
You published your first novel, Burning,
in 2008.

305
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:43,210
And the urban mystery novel,
Don't Get Fooled Again, in 2009.

306
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,670
In 2012, you worked as the scriptwriter
for the drama of Don't Get Fooled Again,

307
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:47,870
marking your career transition
to script writing.

308
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,370
So far 12 teleplays based

309
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:50,340
on your script writing were aired.

310
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,570
In recent years,
the company has been transitioning

311
00:16:52,570 --> 00:16:54,510
into film and television production
and investment business.

312
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:56,370
I really love your plays

313
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:58,740
and want to become a scriptwriter
like you.

314
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,410
I hope you can give me a chance.

315
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:04,010
But you don't have any experience

316
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:06,140
in script writing.

317
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,870
Ms. Su,

318
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:10,210
the job requirements don't state

319
00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:11,510
that script writing experience is a must.

320
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,810
I think he's quite promising.

321
00:17:22,870 --> 00:17:24,110
How about giving him a chance?

322
00:17:29,410 --> 00:17:31,370
The salary for this position
is only 3,000 yuan,

323
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:32,670
you need to start at 9:00 AM,

324
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:33,370
the working hours are not fixed

325
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:34,870
and there's lots of overtime.

326
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:36,810
I can accept all of that.

327
00:17:36,810 --> 00:17:37,940
I'll come to work tomorrow.

328
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:43,510
Alright, you can go home for today.

329
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:45,670
What now?

330
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:48,610
I want to go with you after work.

331
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:50,540
Do you two know each other?

332
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,410
- We do not
- We do.

333
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,570
Well, go ahead.

334
00:17:58,570 --> 00:17:59,410
I'm leaving.

335
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:00,610
Let me explain.

336
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:01,910
I just bumped into each other
and chatted a bit.

337
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:09,610
What are you doing?

338
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:17,410
Alright,

339
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:18,610
that should do it.

340
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:20,940
In the eyes of a boy who likes you,

341
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,510
a girl is forever an 18-year-old girl.

342
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:23,540
See you tomorrow.

343
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:55,310
Why aren't you blow-drying your hair?

344
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:55,810
It's alright.

345
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:57,140
It'll dry naturally.

346
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:58,770
That won't do.

347
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:00,270
If you don't blow-dry it,

348
00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:01,310
you'll get a headache tomorrow.

349
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:02,770
I'm fine.

350
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:04,270
I'll blow-dry it for you.

351
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:06,740
No need.

352
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,940
Your hand hasn't recover yet.

353
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:09,670
It's not a problem.

354
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:12,070
Here I am.

355
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:16,810
Honey,

356
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:17,140
here.

357
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:20,370
Lie down.

358
00:19:39,310 --> 00:19:40,070
Honey,

359
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,310
you're so nice to me.

360
00:19:46,610 --> 00:19:48,740
Although our financial situation

361
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:49,910
is worse than before,

362
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:52,940
I feel happier now.

363
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,710
Lately,

364
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:56,410
I took on a small project myself

365
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:57,740
and made some money.

366
00:19:58,570 --> 00:19:59,910
I think

367
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:01,140
as long as I work hard,

368
00:20:02,110 --> 00:20:04,070
I can pay the money back.

369
00:20:06,470 --> 00:20:08,340
Once I've paid off the debt,

370
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,940
the money I make in the future,

371
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:10,710
will be all given to you.

372
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:16,140
Oh,

373
00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:23,970
I almost forgot to give you this.

374
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:26,770
Let's work together

375
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:28,410
to pay off the debt as soon as possible.

376
00:20:28,410 --> 00:20:29,310
Thank you, Honey.

[Recharge successful
Recharge amount: 10,000.00]

378
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:15,350
The house has been thoroughly checked.

379
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:16,950
It's clean now.

380
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:18,420
However, for safety reasons,

381
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,020
I suggest you stay in another place,

382
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,620
until the window is fixed.

383
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:22,620
Be cautious in the next few days.

384
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,980
We have already informed
the property management.

385
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,220
They will enhance security checks.

386

please contact us immediately.

388

Thank you, Officers.

389
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:30,990
No problem.

390
00:22:50,390 --> 00:22:51,690
Who are you looking for?

391
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:52,150
Hello.

392
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:52,690
I wanted to ask

393
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:54,450
about the girl who used to live here.

394
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:55,750
She moved out.

395
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:58,390
Do you know where she went?

396
00:22:58,790 --> 00:22:59,820
I have no idea.

397
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:02,290
That morally bankrupt woman?

398
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:03,390
I don't care where she went.

399
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:06,890
You look so familiar.

400
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:08,850
What's your relationship with her?

401
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,420
You're Zhang Shuheng.

402
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,550
You might have mistaken me
for someone else.

403
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,790
Are you here to see your mistress?

404
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:34,860
Please come in.

405
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,020
What now?

406
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,360
Why are so hostile towards me?

407
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,820
This's the first thing I said

408
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,740
to you since I come to work.

409
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,540
I've always had a bad temper.

410
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,860
If you can't handle it,

411
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,740
maybe you should ask yourself

412
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,260
why others can live with it.

413
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:57,390
You're friendly to others.

414
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,560
This's clearly a case of double standards.

415
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,220
It's working hours now.

416
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,590
I don't want to argue with you.

417
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:04,860
If you have nothing else, please leave.

418
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:06,590
Wait,

419
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,160
you haven't assigned me today's tasks.

420
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:18,660
Your task is to read these three books,
Save the Kitty,

421
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,260
and send me your reading notes.

422
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,960
Reading three books in a day?

423
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:25,460
If you can't do it,

424
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:27,720
then resign.

425
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:33,120
For Don't We All Love Dresses,

426
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,790
I've reviewed quotes
from each company,

427
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:36,860
the quote
of Mr. Zhang's company is the highest.

428
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,120
Why are we still staying in contact
with them?

429
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,790
Although their quote is the highest,

430
00:24:41,790 --> 00:24:44,020
they have the best value for money.

431
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,420
Their creative team is

432
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,920
of movie-level quality.

433
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,590
They're very motivated
to make this project a success.

434
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:51,860
Also, they have put in a lot of effort.

435
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:54,020
Otherwise, the team they proposed

436
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,790
would not have offered such price.

437
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:57,560
I believe the project

438
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,390
Don't We All Love Dresses

439
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:00,160
has high demands

440
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:03,060
for art, styling, and visual presentation.

441
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:04,920
I'm thinking of making the play better

442
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:06,620
and its overall quality enhanced.

443
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,520
But

444
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,320
the audience today may not care that.

445
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:10,960
It's okay.

446
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,360
We can change the team.

447
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,760
I'll follow up
with other companies right now.

448
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:15,790
Hold on,

449
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,020
the quality of Don't We All Love Dresses

450
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,660
is important.

451
00:25:23,660 --> 00:25:25,120
You continue to follow up.

452
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,190
I trust you.

453
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:26,990
Alright,

454
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:28,120
I'll get back to work.

455
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,420
I didn't expect him to work so diligently.

456
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:27,820
Wait a moment.

457
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:28,790
I'm done right away.

458
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,260
Aren't you aware of the time?

459
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:31,790
I'm off work now.

460

Yes, it's me.

Sharp-tongued but kind-hearted.

466
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,740
I guess that's also a case
of double standards.

via fast delivery.)

You're here.

What?

485
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:39,410
Why do you look at me like
you've seen a ghost?

486
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,180
Clear conscience never fears seeing
a ghost.

487
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:43,680
It seems

488
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,440
you've done something wrong.

489
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:46,680
What do you want?

490
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,010
You've taken everything from me.

491
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,340
Since you didn't let me live in peace,

492
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,780
I won't let you live in peace either.

493
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:59,140
I never expected

494
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:03,180
such a pleasant surprise.

495
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,180
In spite of the trust that Su Li had
in her bestie,

496
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,540
you still schemed behind her back.

497
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,980
You know

498
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,140
Su Li hates being lied to the most.

499
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:19,140
If she finds out,

500
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,380
what do you think she'll do to you?

501
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:23,580
Considering that you used

502
00:30:24,410 --> 00:30:26,080
to be my assistant and work for me,

503
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,410
you're the first buyer I approached.

504
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:29,810
I don't have any money.

but Su Li does.

507
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:40,740
I've figured it out.

508
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:43,240
There's nothing for me taking revenge
on Su Li.

509
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,980
I've used all my remaining connections.

510
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:48,280

I plan to work behind the scenes.

513
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,440
I've already found investors

514
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,880
and the contract has been signed.

515
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,040
I'm in desperate need of money.

516
00:30:58,780 --> 00:30:59,680
One million yuan.

517

I'll pay you back in a week.

518
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,880
Since she trusts you so much,

519
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,210
you must have a way, right?

00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,210
You can appropriating funds
from any projects.

00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:16,540
I'll pay you back one week later.
She'll never find out.
