192
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,720
I'm here to celebrate for you.

193
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:21,290
I'm your wife.

194
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,320
I've gone through the hard times with you,

195
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,890
so I also want to celebrate your glory
with you.

196
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:26,920
Isn't it okay?

197
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,460
Sure it is.

198
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,360
It's just...

199
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:33,520
you look special today.

200
00:13:34,890 --> 00:13:36,060
In what way?

201
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,520
Maybe specially beautiful.

202
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:44,820
Time to start dinner.

203
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,160
Take a seat.

204
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,090
Everyone,

205
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,320
today is a big day for Mr. Shen.

206
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,320
Come. Let Mr. Shen say a few words.

207
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,720
Great. Mr. Shen, say something.

208
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:58,520
Okay.

209
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:00,540
Everyone,

210
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,890
today's actually a big day
for our company.

211
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:04,760
We...

212
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,220
Excuse me.

213
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,220
Sorry, a duty call, I have to take it.

214
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:12,360
Hello?

215
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:16,060
Say it again?

216
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,460
What do you mean by "canceled"?

217
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,020
I'm celebrating with all, now you told me
the investment's canceled.

218
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,360
Where did things go wrong?

219
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:25,720
You better figure it out immediately!

220
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:26,660
Hurry.

221
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:34,720
What happened?

222
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:39,920
Ren,

223
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,860
everyone's waiting for your speech.

224
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:46,690
Ren.

225
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,860
Enough!

226
00:14:56,660 --> 00:14:57,520
Stop annoying me.

227
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:11,490
Just a few words.

228
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:12,620
Actually,

229
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,220
about the funding issue,

230
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,490
Mr. Sun knows,

231
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,020
is a success thanks to
the collective effort

232
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,060
of our colleagues in a short period
of just a few months.

233
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,690
The whole process was more successful
than we expected

234
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:24,760
and costed less time.

235
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,260
We owe the it the most

236
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,700
to our colleagues involved in the project.

237
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,920
Honey, how's this suit?

238
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:51,760
How about this?

239
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:53,090
This's better.

240
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,460
It's so late,

241
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,100
what are we preparing for?

242
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,620
I've been invited
to a charity auction tomorrow.

243
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,290
We should show together.

244
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,020
It'll help offset the impact

245
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,890
of the scandal before.

246
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,620
So you can have a comeback earlier.

247
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:09,160
That's great.

248
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:10,760
Honey, help me check more.

249
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:13,960
How about this?

250
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:14,890
Or this one?

251
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:15,660
Let's go with this one.

252

[Angel Night
Celebrity Charity Auction Check-In Desk]

253
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,460
Up next is this diamond

254
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:50,090
from South Africa.

255
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,760
It weighs 6.2 carats.

256
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:55,160
It's impeccable

257
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:57,360
in both clarity and color.

258
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,660
The cutting technique is perfect.

259
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,320
The perfect light is shining

260
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,620
no matter which angle you look at it.

261
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,160
I believe everyone here is tempted

262
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,220
to bid.

263
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,160
Unfortunately,

264
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,060
I have some sad news for you.

[Su Li and Zhang Shuheng showed up
after the cheating scandal,]

266

This diamond

267
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:19,890
[aiming to reject the scandal?]
is only for display.

268
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:21,020
It's because,

269
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:23,090
prior to the auction,

270
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:26,260
someone has purchased it
with a high price.

271
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,920
Who is it?

272
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,290
The buyer is none other than

273
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,320
Zhang Shuheng, Mr. Zhang.

274
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,520

to be Ms. Su Li's birthday,

276
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:50,560
so Mr. Zhang bought it

277
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,260
as a present for his wife, Ms. Su Li.

278
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:54,540
Of course,

279
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,060
to be fair,

00:17:56,490 --> 00:17:59,420
Mr. Zhang offered to pay ten percent more

281
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,860
and buy the diamond

with a high price of two million yuan

00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,320
to celebrate their love

284
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:07,060
that is as everlasting as a diamond.

285
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,520
Honey, I didn't buy it.

286
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:11,020
Did they get it wrong?

287
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,020
I'll ask them about it.

288
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:12,660
Honey,

289
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,920
it's my idea.

290
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,820
This's for your own good.

291
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:20,260
It's actually a PR move

292
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,740
to prove the scandal is untrue

293
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,500
to the public once again.

294
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:26,860
People will think,

295
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,060
if our relationship is broken,

296
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,160
why would you spend so much

297
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,930
on a diamond for me?

298
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:34,600
Also,

299
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,260
the more you spend,

300
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,160
the more it proves

301
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:38,530
we're in love.

302
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:43,330
It turns out to be a match made in heaven,
a talented man for a beautiful lady.

303
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,660
As long as you're happy,

00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,100
I'll buy the most expensive diamond
for you.

I love you.

306
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,060
Honey.

307
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,730
As ruled by law,
jewelry and accessories are considered

308
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,800
as a household item exclusively for one,

309
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:02,260
instead of marital property.

310
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,860
Well, I'll just buy some more tomorrow.

311
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:06,330
But the case is,

312
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,130
if your jewelry is too expensive,

313
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,000
the court might consider it

314
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,760
as martial property
when making a decision.

315
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,160
Then it's no use to me.

316
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:15,900
But it's different

317
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,400
if the jewelry is clearly

318
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:19,000
to be gifted.

319
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,000

Try this one.

327
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:51,560
It's also insufficient.

00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:53,360
It's so late.

344
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,500
Why don't wake me up?

345
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,160
Since you've been really tired these days

346
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,000
and just had a celebration party
yesterday,

347
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,200

356
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:18,430
go have a walk by yourself

357
00:21:18,430 --> 00:21:19,630
if you're free.

358
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:22,990
Also,

359
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:25,190
that fish tank's too small.

360
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:26,990
There's not enough space

361
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:28,160
for two fishes, one big and one small.

362
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:30,030
You may just let one go.

363
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:32,230
I have things to do.

364
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:33,090
I'm leaving.

365
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:41,560
I'm not talking about business.

366
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:45,160
I'm just waiting

367
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:46,960
for the paperwork
of the property overseas property,

368
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,930
then most
of the property will be transferred.

369
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,560
How did it go with your husband yesterday?

370
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:54,960

Pretty good.

379
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:31,980
Waiting for a taxi?

380
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,080
What a coincidence.

381
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:34,780
Yeah.

382
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:36,720
Get in the car.

383
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,980
Get in the car. I'll give you a lift.

384
00:22:50,150 --> 00:22:51,420
You're pregnant.

385
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,350
You shouldn't carry so much stuff.

386
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:54,680
Where's your boyfriend?

387
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:56,520
He's busy at work,

388
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:59,950
but I bought all these with his card.

389
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:03,180
So he paid you off?

390
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,280
Love can't be measured with money.

391
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,650
It's too cheap.

392
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:08,750
What does he think of you?

393
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,520
A woman he can pay to have?

394
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:13,580
What our women need is companionship.

395
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,120
He's nice to me.

396
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,820
Comes over whenever he's not busy.

397
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:19,120
It's all excuse.

398
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,820
It's just instinct desire

399
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:23,950
for pretty young ladies.

400
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,680
It's nothing more.

401
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,220
Are you free tonight?

402
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:30,920
Let's have dinner.

403
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:33,020
I have plans.

404
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:34,720
My boyfriend is coming to get me.

405
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:35,620
Where's Shuheng?

406
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,120
He's not having dinner with you?

407
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:38,580
He's busy.

408
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:40,820
How busy can he be?

409
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:42,880
Can't he spare time to have dinner
with you?

410
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:44,380
Yeah.

411
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,820
He's been out a lot lately.

412
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:49,150
I'd think he's cheating on me

413
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:51,980
if I didn't trust him.

414
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:17,280
[Youhe City Hospital]

415
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,320
Honey, are you okay?

416
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:19,550
Just a scratch.

417
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:20,480
I'm fine.

418
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:22,320
Does it hurt?

419
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:24,320
Yingying's still inside.

420
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,480
I don't know whether she's okay.

421
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:29,150
Which one is Chen Yingying's family?

422
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:30,120
Over here.

423
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:31,150
Doctor,

424
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:32,220
is she alright?

425
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:33,880
She's checked out.

426
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,920
There are no injuries,
but a little bit malnourished.

427
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,220
What about the baby?

428
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,550
What baby? She's not pregnant.

429
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,750
How's it possible?

430
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:52,680
Check how low her HCG levels are.

431
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,680
How could she be pregnant?

432
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,580
Get back and have plenty of rest.

433
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:56,580
Get her on a nutritious diet.

434
00:24:57,150 --> 00:24:57,880
Thank you.

435
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:00,150
Honey,

436
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,200
if Yingying's not pregnant,

437
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,340
why did she lie to us?

438
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,800
Shuheng, what are you doing here?

439
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,360
Yingying,

440
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:10,460
the doctor said you're not pregnant.

441
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:14,530
I'm glad you're okay.

442
00:25:16,530 --> 00:25:16,860
Honey,

443
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,100
I left some work unfinished,

444
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,000
I have to go.

445
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,200
I'll ask my assistant to drive you home.

446
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:41,930
Still hurts?

447
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:42,900
Not really.

[Mr. Wu]

452
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:29,530
Honey,

453
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:31,860
do you think
meeting Yixing Entertainment's boss

454
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,600
in private will cause a misunderstanding
with Mr. Li?

455
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,260
After all,

456
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,600
the two companies are competitors.

457
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:38,960
In the industry,

458
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,730
there are no eternal enemies.

459
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,700
It's just like seeing a friend of mine.

460
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,360
Keep it casual.

461
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:44,700
Your boss won't find out.

462
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,500
Okay.

This way please, Ms. Su, Mr. Zhang.

464
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:52,160

Hello, Mr. Zhang.

471

I honor you.

00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:01,460
I've ordered.

475
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,930
My wife told me so much about you.

476
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:08,160
I heard you're working on a teleplay,
right?

477
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:10,900
What's Zhang Shuheng trying

478
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:12,560
to do?

479

Excuse me, I need to make a call.

what Zhang Shuheng has been

482
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,730
up to lately.

483
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:22,900
Is he looking for a new agency?

484
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:24,600
If so,

485
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:26,400
stop all his work.

486
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:28,760
Right.

487
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,330
Tell them it's from me.

488
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:31,960
I hope we can work together someday.

489
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,000
This is to our cooperation in advance.

490
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:36,700
Hello?

491

that Zhang Shuheng has found a new agency,

493
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:43,460
to Yixing Entertainment.

494
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:53,900
What takes you so long?

495
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:55,960
My stomach feels a bit off.

496
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:57,000
I'm fine now.

497
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:58,500
Okay.

498
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:04,900
I think Mr. Zhang's quite powerful.

499
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:06,960
Why don't you start with the profile
of the role?

500
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,330
It's good for you

501
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:10,760
to get prepared if you're in the play.

502
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:19,960
Are you okay?

503
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:20,460
Honey,

504
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:20,930
are you okay?

505
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,060
I'm fine.

506
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:22,900
Are you okay?

507
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:26,360

What happened?

511
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,600
We were just walking

512
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:44,560
and a car came out of nowhere.

513
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:47,460
Luckily you're fine.

514
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:51,300
You must be Zhang Shuheng.

515
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:52,900
You know me?

516
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,140
Then you must be Su Li.

517
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,940

519
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,800
is his leg OK?

520
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,500
We'll clean it up first

521
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,400
and see whether he needs stitches.

522
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,170
Your husband's so good to you.

523
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,170
He'd rather get hurt to protect you.

524
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,600
Guys nowadays are not like him.

525

526
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:12,800
you're afraid of blood.

527
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:13,970
Wait for me out there.

528
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:16,040
I'm good.

529
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,500
The news I asked you to spread...

530
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,170
put a hold on that.

531
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:52,600
Don't do it now.

[Surgery Department]

533
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,740

You go ahead.

543
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,140
I'm really okay.

544
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,370
Don't worry.

545
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,170
I'll ask my assistant to get me.

546
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,500
Fine, I'm coming over now.

Be careful.

Don't worry.

550
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,300

to tell you.

What?

00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:45,800
You pregnant again?

558
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,040
I shouldn't have lied to you.

559
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:51,170
Do you think Su Li is honest
with you all the time?

560
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:52,700
What do you mean?

561
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,400
She knew about our affair long ago

562
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:56,100
and she's busy with property transfer.

563
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,440
Property transfer?

I went to see a lawyer
about a contract the other day

565
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,040
and accidentally saw Su Li

00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:07,940
While they were out,

569
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,600
I went through the lawyer's desk.

570
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,840
[Divorce Litigation Authorization]
Then I saw Su Li's divorce papers.

571
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,540
[Client: Su Li]

572
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,600
That's when it hit me

573
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,500
she's been plotting revenge for long,

574
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,800
including what happened today.

575
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,400
I just saw Mr. Li was here.

576
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:30,900
She purposely arranged it

577
00:32:31,170 --> 00:32:33,600
to let Mr. Li see you
with Yixing Entertainment's boss.

578
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:35,740
The revenge before isn't enough.

579
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:38,100
She wants you to be on the blacklist,

580
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:38,940
be buried

581
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,370
and to have no chance in this industry.

582
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:47,700
It seems

583
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,770
that we need to take actions.

584
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,600
What takes you so long?

585
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:52,600
My stomach feels a bit off.

586
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:53,900
I'm fine now.

587
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,200
Okay.

588
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:39,700
Your leg still hurts?

589
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,140
I'm okay.

590
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,600
It's nothing.

591
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,500
If we didn't play this trick,

592
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:47,740
Su Li would never have softened her heart.

593
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,940
Lucky to have you warn me.

594
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,200
Otherwise,

595
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:55,040
I would have fallen for her lies again.

596
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:58,240
What should we do next?

597
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:01,840
We're not sure how much property

598
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:03,500
Su Li has transferred.

599
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,400
Last time at the auction,

600
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,340
she tricked me into buying a diamond.

601
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,940
I must take back what belongs to me

602
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,300
and completely sever ties
