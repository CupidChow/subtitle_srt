I just want to thank you.

189
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,930
Among all my acquaintances,

190
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:44,200
you're the only one who reminded me

191
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:50,730
and helped me unmask all the hypocrisy.

192
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:55,860
That night,

193
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,260
at the hotel, the moment I took a picture

194
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:03,500

195
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,330

Well, take my coat.

204
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,530
Thanks, I feel better.

205

206

give me a chance to help you.

207
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,360
Su Li,

208
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:14,600
hitting low points in life is inevitable.

209
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,500
How about seeing it as

210
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:20,330

after pushing yourself hard?

211
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,600

217
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:55,600
Yingying, why are you here?

218
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,300
I'm here for the audition.

219
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,160
But I haven't informed you,

220
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,660
how did you know there's an audition
today?

221
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:06,460
I read the post by your casting crew
on Wechat Moments.

222
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,260
You should have told me you're coming.

223
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,600
As we're so close,

224
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,460
you don't need to audition
with all those others.

225
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:25,360
It's OK.

226
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:26,730
Good luck.

227
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,060
In the audition,
all of you should help each other

228
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,130
and find your acting partner in advance.

229
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:46,200
Hello.

230
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,100
Could you be my partner?

231
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,100
So close with Ms. Su,

232
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,560
certainly you don't need my help.

233
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,400
You're just jealous of me.

234
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:12,560
Clearly him and me are meant to be.

235
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,460
You're old and aggressive,

236
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:17,160
men have no reasons to be with you.

237
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,660
Reasons?

238
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:21,460
The reason he cheated on me is because
you're just going squawk on

239
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,730
like an idiot?

240
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:25,260
I suppose a deserted woman
like you needs some kind of outlet.

241
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,130
Thank you, Ms. Su.

Well performed,

244
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,420
but your portrayal is still slightly

245
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,130
off from the character's age.

246
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,360

I couldn't find one.

00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,200
You slapped me?

257

You deserve it!

259
00:19:55,130 --> 00:19:56,660
You stole my boyfriend,

260
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,900
I wished I could kill you
to get some relief.

261
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:05,530
You must understand

262
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:07,200
that he's my husband!

263
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,930
You're the mistress!

264
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:11,500
I'm the only one he loves.

265
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,930
He goofed around with you

266
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:14,300
because he was just confused.

267
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:19,180
He's a circle
and I'm the center of this circle.

268
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,420
He's always around me.

269
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,580
But you?

270
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:25,980
You're just an auxiliary line.

271
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,320
How could you be so naive?

272
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,020
You really think
that you're his true love?

273
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:35,780
Men cheating can be either zero times

274

or countless times.

At that time,

277

I'm afraid that you're even more miserable
than me.

278
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,320
Yingying,

279
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,980
did I hurt you?

280
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,350
I just wanted to help you get
into your character quickly.

281
00:21:01,350 --> 00:21:01,950
Are you okay?

282
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:02,860
It's fine.

in the stock market.

369
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:24,710
I can only raise
hundreds of thousands of yuan.

370
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:28,980
You don't,

371
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:31,110
but your wife does.

372
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:34,180
Give her a good reason,

373
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:35,580
ask her for it.

374
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:59,500
[Unknown: 16 hours left.]

375
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:08,110
Honey, could you lend me some money?

376
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:10,380
Sure,

377
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,820
give you a big red pocket.

378
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:12,550
Is 200 yuan enough?

379
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,780
It's far from enough.

380
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:16,820
How much do you want?

381
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,420
500?

382
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,020
No.

383
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,720
500...

384
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,020
550?

385
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:40,780
Five million yuan.

386
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:42,120
A great deal of money!

387
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,300
Did you get caught cheating

388
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,800
by the paparazzi and want to fix it
with the money?

389
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,770
How's that possible?

390
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,300
I'm just kidding.

391
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,300
Here is the thing.

392
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,200
Mr. Wu called me a few days ago,

393
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,840
bringing me a program to work with.

394
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,170
He said it'd make big money this time.

395
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,900
I'll give you the money back. I promise.

396
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:07,140
Don't say that, we're a couple.

397
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,770
I'll go to the bank and transfer it
to you tomorrow.

398
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,800
Also, Mr. Wu said the time's tight
this time,

399
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,140
the sooner, the better.

400
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:17,540
Sure.

401

403
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,140
The money is ready.

404
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:42,500
There's still time,

405
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,540
I'll transfer the money right away.

406
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:45,340
Wait a minute,

407
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:47,340
you can't send him all the money
at a time.

408
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:49,140
Send him 500 thousand yuan first,

so it has to be made one by one.

410
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,370
I searched last night.

411
00:28:56,500 --> 00:28:59,940
With 500 thousand yuan,
we can accuse him of blackmail.

412
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,600
The sentence is up to ten years.

413
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,240
If he takes the 500 thousand yuan,
the situation will be turned around.

414
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,600
We can not only get back our money,

415
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:10,940
but also ask him to destroy the photos.

416
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:12,240
So smart.

417
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:15,900
(Things have changed.)

418
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,340

to the Exhibition Center before 4:00.)

423
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,180
(there's no time.)

424
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:31,980
(When time's out,
you know what will happen.)

425
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,140
What do we do now?

426
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,100
Send him five million yuan?

427
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,940
What else can be done?

428
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:42,700

With 500 thousand yuan,

00:32:51,570 --> 00:32:53,800

Su Li, why did you take the time

441
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:01,140
to get five million yuan
from Zhang Shuheng?

442
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,940
The money belongs to you.

443
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,140
The money used to be our money,

444
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:07,770
now it is entirely mine.

445

why do you still want to break the news?
