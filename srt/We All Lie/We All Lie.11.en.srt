[Episode 11]

23
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,120
Su Li,

24
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:53,320
Chen Yingying's coming,

25
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,460
with a bunch of reporters.

26
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,660
Zhang Shuheng's a liar.

27
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,490
(Su Li,)

28
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:23,090
(don't you enjoy pretending
to be innocent in front of the camera?)

29
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,290
(Today,)

30
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,120
(I'll beat you)

31
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,860
(at your own game.)

32
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,290
Su Li,

33
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,660
you finally show up.

34
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,290
You've set up the stage,

35
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,490
I guess I should show my support.

36
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:57,420
Su Li,

37
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,890
I'm really sorry.

38
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:02,660
I didn't resist Zhang Shuheng's temptation
at that time

39
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,060
and did so many things that hurt you.

40
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:07,060
I really regret the things I did.

41
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,460
I wish time could turn back.

42
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,460
Me too.

43
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:17,060
I also wish time could turn back

44
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,660
to give me another chance to choose again.

45
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:31,460
I'll choose to stay away
from both of you jerks.

46
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,860
I regret it so much that I want to die.

47
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,860
I've died once already.

48
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:47,860
Look,

49
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:50,020
how else do you want me to prove it?

50
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,120
Is a wrist that has just been cut

51
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,690
so agile?

52
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:07,360
Ah, it's fake.

53
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,290
It's fake.

54
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:11,220
No wonder you rushed to the hospital.

55
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,760
A bit later you would have recovered.

56
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,060
What?

57
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,090
You find my words offensive?

58
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,460
Don't think I'm being rude.

59
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,520
On the contrary,

60
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,490
it's my good manners

61
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:30,920
and a sense of social responsibility
to abide by laws and regulations

62
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:31,860
that restrain me

63
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,520
from the impulse to directly beat you.

64
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,120
Now,

65
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,490
all the pain you're going through

66
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,660
is well-deserved.

67
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,690
Ms. Chen, is this wound fake?

68
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,090
Stop filming.

69
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:49,620
I said. Stop filming.

70
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,720
Stop filming.

71
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,060
Ms. Chen, is the wound fake or not?

72
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:58,120
Stop filming.

73
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,460
Shen Charen,

74
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:22,420
you sly boy!

75
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,480
Where 's the money?

76
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,140
Sir,

77
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,710
give me a few more days.

78
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:32,340
It's been over ten days.

79
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,880
Do you think I'm doing charity here?

80
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,280
Sir,

81
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,110
three more days.

82
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,740
Please give me three more days.

83
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:44,540
Three more days!

84
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,480
What are you doing?

85
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,640
I've already called the police.

86
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:00,280
Fine, three days.

87
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,040
I'll calculate the interest for you first.

88
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,780
If you don't pay by then,

89
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,580
you're died.

90
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,080
Let's go.

91
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,540
Are you okay?

92
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,540
Who are they?

93
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,710
Who are those people?

94
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:33,980
Let's go home first.

95
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,340
Come on.

96
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:04,140
So what's going on?

97
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,280
Do you remember...

98
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,340
Peter?

99
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:12,710
Your business partner?

100
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:14,870
Yes.

101
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:18,810
That guy is a liar.

102
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:21,910
He deceived me
into investing all my money,

103
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:26,670
and took out high-interest loans
under my name.

104
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,670
Those people were debt collectors,

105
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:32,340
but I don't have the money.

106
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,210
How much do you owe?

107
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,140
Five million yuan.

108
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:38,540
That much?

109
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,470
Ganggang, don't worry.

110
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,940
This's my own matter,

111
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,240
not yours.

112
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,360
So

113
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,530
you come back

114
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:55,800
to avoid debt collectors?

115
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,300
No.

116
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,400
Ganggang.

117
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:07,930
Ganggang...

118
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:32,200
Ganggang,

119
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:33,930
time to eat.

120
00:08:37,930 --> 00:08:38,700
I'm not in the mood.

121
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,260
Zhang.

122
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:15,260
Yeah, it's me.

123
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,260
Well,

124
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,130
would it be possible for you
to lend me some money?

125
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:20,860
I'm strapped for cash.

126
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:23,800
Okay.

127
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:27,560
Yang.

128
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:28,500
Yeah.

129
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,400
How's going?

130
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:32,960
Well, Yang.

131
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,600
Would it be possible for you
to lend me some money?

132
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,330
I'm really tight on cash.

133
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:41,260
They haven't paid you back yet?

134
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,800
It's been tough.

135
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:46,930
Okay.

136
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:28,930
(I can make amends.)

137
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,300
Please trust me.

138
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,800
I'll be extra good to you.

139
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,260
Don't be like this.

140
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,160
Beat me or curse at me, whatever.

141
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:37,900
Stop it.

142
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:38,930
You can punish me whatever you like.

143
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,360
Just don't kick me out.

144
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:45,930
Honey,

145
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:48,960
thanks for letting me home.

146
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,400
(My baby.)

147
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,960
(Mom has everything prepared for you,)

148
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,700
(to give you the best education,)

149
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:12,200
(show you the most beautiful scenery)

150
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,500
(and become your best friend.)

151
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,660
(But now,)

152
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,060
(our plans)

153
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:22,000
(have to be indefinitely postponed.)

154
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:24,330
(I'm sorry.)

155
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,930
(A lot has happened during this time,)

156
00:11:27,930 --> 00:11:30,700
(trapping me in a nightmare.)

157
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,130
(Your presence,)

158
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:35,260
(like a warm sunshine,)

159
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,350
(has brought me a lot of relief.)

160
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,020
(But perhaps it wasn't meant to be.)

161
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:43,620
(In the end,)

162
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,880
(I couldn't hold onto you.)

163
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,020
(Take care)

164
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:51,420
(in another world.)

165
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,480
(Mom needs to move on too.)

166
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,380
(These heartbreaking things)

167
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:58,120
(have turned into ashes.)

168
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,080
(While there might be a twinge )

169
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,520
(of emotion when I recall it,)

170
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,820
(I won't dwell on it anymore.)

171
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:46,920
Honey.

172
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:53,880
Take this.

173
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,080
It's my savings from all these years.

174
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,750
Use it to settle the debt first

175
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,880
and I'll

176
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,520
figure the rest out.

177
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,780
Honey.

178
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:18,720
Thank you.

179
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,150
Ms. Su,

180
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,380
Mr. Chen's in another meeting.

181
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,150
It'll be finished soon.

182
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,080
Please wait for a moment.

183
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,080
No problem.

184
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,280
Please rest here.

185
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,180
Thank you.

186
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:47,280
Ms. Su,

187
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,720
thanks for your patience.

188
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,520
Hello, Mr. Chen.

189
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,420
Hello.

190
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,480
Ms. Su, who is this...

191
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,720
This is my assistant,

192
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,320

193
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,380
Hello, Mr. Chen.

194
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:01,880
Alright, let's talk inside.

195
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,350
- Fine.
- Okay.

196
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,340
It's about the balance payment
for our last project.

197
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:09,180
Help me coordinate this.

198
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:09,880
I've mentioned this to you before.

199
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:13,740
Mr. Chen,

200
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,080
this is the entire timeline
for our project,

201
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,180
along with the budget sheet.

202
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:19,240
I previously sent it to your email.

203
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,700
Is there any questions?

204
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,600
No.

205
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,130
All good.

206
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,960
Well, our contract...

207
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,560
I have also prepared the contract.

208
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,800
Are there any issues with this contract?

209
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,130
The contract is fine,

210
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,460
but

211
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,700
I have a private request.

212
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,860
I'm not sure if I should mention it.

213
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,500
I believe

214
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,760
in fate.

215
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,760
When I first saw your assistant just now,

216
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:55,730
a unique and inexplicable feeling

217
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:56,600
instantly arose.

218
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,300
I wonder

219
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,930
if you could allow me
to have a further conversation

220
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:01,500
with your assistant?

221
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,200
No.

222
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,460
Didn't you ask me
if you should mention it?

223
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,330
My answer is no.

224
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:10,260
We shall discuss this contract

225
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,860
the other day.

226
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:12,960
When is the other day?

227
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:18,460
Mr. Chen,

228
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:21,860
I don't know if you're pretending
to be a fool or not.

229
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,500
In the adult world,

230
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,130
the other day means never.

231
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:27,000
Next time means don't ask again

232
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,500
and in the future means bye-bye.

233
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,400
Look at you, full of dirty thoughts,

234
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,400
you're surely an adult.

237
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:50,560
Su Li,

238
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,090
is the contract settled this quickly?

239
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,130
The cooperation is over.

240
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:54,890
What happened?

241
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:01,290
Nothing.

242
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,430
By the way, give me the phone
I gave to you before.

243
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,900
I left it at Mr. Chen's company.

244
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:13,540
I'll grab it.

245
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,710
You go ahead.

246
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:20,770
Mr. Chen.

247
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:22,170
Ganggang,

248
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:23,570
why are you back again?

249
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:25,710
I left something behind.

250
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:26,610
Ms. Su has already gone downstairs.

251
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:29,810
By the way,

252
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:32,780
can you reconsider the contract, Mr. Chen?

253
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,540
Ms. Su has really put in a lot of effort.

254
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,340
She sincerely hopes to collaborate
with your company.

255
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,800
Ms. Su didn't tell you about

256
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,260
what just happened?

257
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,200
No, she didn't.

258
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:46,600
Ganggang,

259
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,160
actually,

260
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,960
I quiet appreciate you.

261
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:51,260
You're so young and should have

262
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:53,160
better development opportunities.

263
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,260
Doing errands

264
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:58,200
with Ms. Su seems

265
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,100
like a waste.

266
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,600
Ms. Su treats me well.

267
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,300
Well?

268
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,060
I don't think so.

269
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,460
I just suggested to her

270
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:08,400
that we transfer you to my company
and be an administrative manager.

271
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,500
Do you know what she said?

272
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,460
She said your abilities are limited

273
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,000
and you can only be an assistant.

274
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,460
I don't want you to be kept in the dark.

275
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,760
That's why I told you this.

276
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:27,930
Ms. Su

277
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:29,800
is quite self-centered,

278
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,300
even a bit selfish.

279
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,100
I prefer not to work with such a person.

280
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,000
Judge for yourself

281
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,300

282

Three years ago today,

284
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,160
I could only afford

285
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:40,930
to buy you a silver ring.

286
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,660
I've always wanted to make it up
to you since then.

287

Yet three years later,

288
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:52,000
I still don't have much money.

289
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,760
But I'll never forget the day

290

Forgive me, this failed husband,

292

for not giving you a better life.

293

No, he lied because...

381
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:28,780
You can only believe half of his words.

382
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,910
You are stupid if you believe it all.

383
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:33,580
I didn't approve of you two getting back
together at first.

384
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,580
For now,

385
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,210
he can't be trusted at all.

386
00:24:36,210 --> 00:24:37,550
No, Su Li.

387
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:39,450
Charen has changed.

388
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:40,910
He's so nice to me now.

389
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:41,450
It's true!

390
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:44,810
Ganggang,

391
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:47,110
even if you'll be mad at me,

392
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:48,580
I won't

393
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:50,380
lend money to you.

394
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,620
You're tricked

395
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:54,120
by your husband's sudden tenderness now.

396
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:55,780
Sometimes,

397
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,910
we need a slap on the face

398
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:59,180
instead of a candy.

399
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,580
Someone appears in your life

400
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:01,510
just to tell you

401
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:02,610
you are so gullible.

402
00:25:03,850 --> 00:25:04,810
-Bye.
-Su Li...

403
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:05,950
Su Li!

404
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:14,180
Honey, I'm back.

405
00:25:14,810 --> 00:25:15,610
Oh, hi.

406
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:16,150
You're just in time.

407
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,450
Dinner is ready.

408
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:20,820
Come.

409
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:26,210
Tired?

410
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,750
Let's have dinner.

411
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:31,180
Okay.

412
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:41,950
What's wrong?

413
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:47,350
Not feeling well?

414
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:48,980
Let's see a doctor?

415
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:51,580
No.

416
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,150
Let's eat now.

417
00:25:57,850 --> 00:25:58,810
Try these ribs.

418
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:01,110
Honey.

419
00:26:02,710 --> 00:26:04,110
Su Li...

420
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:05,510
said no.

421
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:08,050
I thought you two are friends.

422
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:12,050
No.

423
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:13,510
I mean...

424
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,710
The money doesn't matter.

425
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:17,780
I can solve it on my own.

426
00:26:20,810 --> 00:26:22,980
But I just feel...

427
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:23,810
Feel what?

428
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:27,850
I feel that Su Li...

429
00:26:30,910 --> 00:26:31,650
It seems...

430
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,710
she doesn't take you as her real friend.

431
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,610
No.

432
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:38,510
Su Li is always nice to me.

433
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:43,780
I'm afraid that you are sincere to her,

434
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:46,180
but she doesn't take you seriously.

435
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:51,620
I've been borrowing money everywhere
these days.

436
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:53,820
And I finally knew
who my "friends" really are.

437
00:26:59,020 --> 00:26:59,380
It's fine.

438
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:01,850
I'll solve it.

439
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:03,650
Let's eat.

440
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:06,580
We'll solve this.

441
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:09,750
A couple should complement each other

442
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,050
and huddle for warmth.

443
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:14,350
I'll be with you.

444
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:18,510
Thank you, Honey.

445
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:22,310
You've been worrying

446
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:23,180
about me recently.

447
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:25,780
Let's see a play tomorrow

448
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:27,210
and relax.

449
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:29,410
Great.

450
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:55,580
Need some help?

451
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:56,250
Yes.

452
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:57,550
Could you please help me...

453
00:27:58,450 --> 00:27:59,050
You...

454
00:27:59,050 --> 00:27:59,610
Done.

455
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:00,580
You're welcome.

456
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:03,850
You don't understand women at all, you.

457
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:12,350
It's you!

458
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:14,310
You know me?

459
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:16,780
I don't,

460
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:17,980
but

461
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,380
you may know me.

462
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,980
I'm the scriptwriter

463
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:22,780
you said

464
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:23,350
to send razor blades to.

465
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:25,980
Su Li?

466
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,750
I actually cursed a scriptwriter

467
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:29,950
to her face!

468
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,550
So you want to curse me

469
00:28:32,550 --> 00:28:33,120
behind my back?

470
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,380
No, I didn't mean this.

471
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,500
If you feel hard to walk,

472
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,570
I can offer a lift.

473
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:39,540
My car's over there.

474
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,310
Well,

475
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:44,640
thank you.

476
00:28:44,970 --> 00:28:45,800
Be careful.

477
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,770
Thank you.

478
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:50,100
Be careful.

479
00:28:53,370 --> 00:28:54,000
Here.

480
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,900
Thank you again.

481
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:57,370
My pleasure.

482
00:28:57,370 --> 00:28:59,370
I really love your works.

483
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:00,440
I'm your fan.

484
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,300
No, I mean it, really.

485
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,570
I grew up loving teleplay.

486
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:05,900
And I always want to be a scriptwriter.

487
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,400
But my father ordered me

488
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,740
to work in my family's company
after graduation.

489
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,570
Can I learn script writing with you?

490
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:12,740
Me?

491
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,970
You should just inherit
your family's fortune.

492
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,570
Screenwriting by yourself

493
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,170
destroys the joy of watching teleplays.

494
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,770
Thank you.

495
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,900
Goodbye.

496
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,600
Be careful.

497
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,400
Okay.

498
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:57,640
Honey.

499
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,240
I'm going out.

500
00:29:59,240 --> 00:29:59,900
Well...

501
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,040
Wait a minute.

502
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,300
Why are you here?

503
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:08,600
Sir.

504
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:11,970
Sir,

505
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,200
I gave you money a few days ago.

506
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,940
Why come again?

507
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,700
Not enough.

508
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,170
It can only pay back your interest.

509
00:30:21,170 --> 00:30:22,300
Now pay the capital.

510
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,740
Sir,

511
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:25,100
it's impossible for me

512
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,940
to pay it back in only two days.

513
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,300
Please give me two more days, alright?

514
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:30,140
Okay.

515
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:32,440
But I'm a businessman.

516
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,540
I'll charge you interest

517
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:36,700
for every day you delay.

518
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:37,240
What?

519
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,570
How many days did you just say?

520
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,170
Two days?

521
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,300
Then I'll take two fingers.

522
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,540
Hold him down.

523
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:47,300
Sir!

524
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:48,140
I have an idea.

525
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:50,540
I can pay it back.

526
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:55,170
Say it.

527
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:57,840
Do...

528
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:00,200
do you know Su Li?

529
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:04,840
Is that Su Li

530
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,570
on trending news lately?

531
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:08,340
Yes, it's her.

532
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,740
I'll show you.

533
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,000
Sir, you see,

534
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,170
a famous screenwriter.

535
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,540
Boss, I know her.

536
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:19,740
She's rich.

537
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:22,100
Sir.

538
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:25,220
She's my wife's bestie.

539
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,160
You can ask her.

540
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,520
She will surely pay for me.

541
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:32,360
Okay.

542
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:36,020
We'll go to find her right now.

543
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:37,790
But

544
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,520
if you dare to trick me,

545
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,360
wait and see.

546
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,220
I won't.

547
00:31:45,990 --> 00:31:46,660
Let's go.

548
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:57,590
Hi, Honey?

549
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:58,660
Where are you?

550
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,120
The play is beginning.

551
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,660
I can't go.

552
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:04,460
Those debt collectors came again
for money.

553
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:05,190
What?

554
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,420
Are you okay?

555
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:08,420
I'm fine. They're gone.

556
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,220
Honey,

557
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:11,320
I have to tell you one thing.

558
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:12,320
Don't be mad, please.

559
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,720
They pulled a knife on me for money.

560
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,260
They wanted to cut my fingers.

561
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,720
I had no choice, so I told them

562
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,860
I knew Su Li.

563
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,990
Now they may come to Su Li.

564
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:21,620
What?

565
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,260
Let's have a look at this proposal.

566
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:49,220
Ms. Su prepared it before.

567
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:49,860
The general solution...

568
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:51,620
Where's Su Li's office?

569
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,590
Who are they?

570
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:57,120
I don't know.

571
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:01,120
You must be Su Li.

572
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,720
What can I do for you?

573
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:05,420
Shen Charen owes us money.

574
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:07,160
You have to pay for him.

575
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:23,190
Wang Ganggang's just my assistant.

576
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:25,320
Assistant! Understand?

577
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:27,820
To put it mildly, she's a nanny.

578
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,620
Do you pay your nanny's debt?

579
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:34,260
We just came from Wang Ganggang's home.

580
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:36,120
Shen Charen told us in person

581
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,960
that you are her bestie.

582
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:38,860
And

583
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,760
he showed us your photo with her.

584
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:42,990
Bestie?

585
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:44,960
In this world,

586
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,660
you can't even believe your own words
without thinking.

587
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,660
How can you believe others' words?

588
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:52,260
If a photo can prove

589
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,390
we're besties,

590
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:55,160
then everyone can be my besties.

591
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:56,790
You can take photos now

592
00:33:56,790 --> 00:33:57,920
and say

593
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,060
you are my brother!

594
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:01,260
Ridiculous!

595
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:04,620
Well,

596
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,220
don't waste your time here.

597
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,460
Go to find Shen Charen.

598
00:34:07,460 --> 00:34:08,820
He owes you money,

599
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:09,920
not me, Su Li.

600
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:13,720
Get out of here or I'll call the police!

601
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:14,920
I have many friends working

602
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,220
in the police office.

603
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:18,560
Leave or not?

604
00:34:23,190 --> 00:34:24,190
Take care, everyone.

605
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:39,260
Luckily, my brain is quick.

606
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:39,660
Otherwise,

607
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:42,020
they will find ways to harass Ganggang.

608
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:49,520
Hello, where are you, Ganggang?

609
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,960
The debt collectors came to me just now.

610
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,790
Are you okay?

611
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,990
Okay,

612
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:54,960
I see.

613
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:56,620
Hello?

614
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:11,520
Honey, I'm back.

615
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:20,720
Honey!

616
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:49,190
Honey.

617
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:49,760
Honey.

618
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:52,220
My hand...

619
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:55,520
The reconstructive surgery has finished.

620
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,020
It will recover.

621
00:35:58,360 --> 00:35:59,590
Everything's okay

622
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:01,190
when you called me...

623
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,120
No.

624
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,920
They found Su Li.

625
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,960
She told them

626
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,060
that you're not her friend
and she won't help you.

627
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,390
Then they came back

628
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:14,820
and beat me.

629
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:24,760
