00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:11,940
Ms. Su,

193
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,310
I made an appointment with Director Li,

194
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:15,610
but his schedule is tight.

195
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:17,610
He has an event in Beijing tomorrow

196
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,910
and only has two hours for dinner.

197
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:21,010
Two hours.

198
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:21,510
It's enough.

199
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:21,940
[Information of Director Li Wen]

200
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:26,470
Isn't this Director Li Wen?

201
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:28,010
He's an internationally reputed director.

202
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:29,410
I have watched all movies directed by him.

203
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:31,910
Are we going to work with him?

204
00:11:31,910 --> 00:11:32,710
Can I see him?

205
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:34,810
We're working on it.

206
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:36,910
So many companies want to work with him.

207
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:37,570
Don't talk nonsense.

208
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:41,770
Have you sorted out all materials
about Director Li?

209
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:42,110
Yes.

210
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,540
Here're his habits,

211
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:47,810
hobbies, and some tips for attention.

212
00:11:47,810 --> 00:11:49,510
I've had someone book the flight and hotel
for tomorrow morning,

213
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:51,070
so we can make preparations in advance.

214
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:53,510
Book a ticket for Wang Weide too.

215
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,070
Yeah, it's safer

216
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,010
for the three of us to go.

217
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:03,310
Mr. Zhang has different opinions
on the casting.

218
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:04,870
You stay here and persuade him.

219
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:07,470
But I've been in charge
of Director Li's matters all the time.

220
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,740
Director Li is known
for his strange personality

221
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:10,940
and bad temper.

222
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,740
Wang Weide can make mistakes
without experience.

223
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:14,110
How about this.

224
00:12:14,110 --> 00:12:15,510
I'll book a later flight.

225
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:17,740
You don't have to work so hard.

226
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:18,670
I'm here.

227
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:19,010
It's fine.

228
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:21,010
Handover your things to him.

229
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:23,070
Wang Weide.

230
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:24,410
Do you have confidence?

231
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,940
Of course.

232
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,670
Artists all have bad tempers.

233
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:30,570
I'll treat him like my girlfriend

234
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:31,210
with full patience,

235
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,210
circumspection and my whole heart.

236
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:35,580
Fine.

237
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,740
Well, here are the materials,

238
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,480
memorize them.

239
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,310
Director Li's a clean freak

240
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:50,540
and obsessed with symmetry.

241
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,180
He has a nearly pathological insistence

242
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:54,510
on artistic coordination
in every detail of life.

243
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,540
Items should be arranged
in a straight line.

244
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,170
He also pursues symmetry and even numbers.

245
00:12:58,170 --> 00:12:59,610
Even the colors should be the same.

246
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:01,940
So we need be very careful with our dress.

247
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,410
Don't antagonize him.

248
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,810
Do I look weird?

249
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:30,810
Your hair...

250
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:32,140
is a little messed up.

251
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:35,470
Let's go.

252
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:36,810
Okay.

253
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:44,010
It's been half an hour.

254
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:44,470
Shall we

255
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:46,140
call them?

256
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:46,670
We can wait.

257
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,370
Sorry, Ms. Su.

258
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:56,210
Sorry to keep you waiting.

259
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:57,810
Director Li.

260
00:13:57,810 --> 00:13:59,110
Hello.

261
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,010
Nice to meet you.

262
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,780
Here's my name card.

263
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:06,510
Please have a seat.

264
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:07,640
Okay, thanks.

265
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,260
Ms. Su's bag looks

266
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,900
very special.

267
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,160
This one is made of recyclable wastes.

268
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,460
Ms. Su made it when she was a volunteer.

269
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,200
Awesome.

270
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:28,560
Director Li, let's order first.

271
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:28,960
Sure.

272
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:30,530
Take a look.

273
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:31,930
Thank you.

274
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:34,100
Duck Stuffed With the Eight Treasures.

275
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:35,900
Jinling Meatballs.

276
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,660
They all famous and expensive.

277
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:42,600
But I am sorry.

278
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,300
I have something to attend to.

279
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:45,900
I can't have it.

280
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:52,060
Director Li, please have a taste.

281
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,560
It's a pity.

282
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,260
I have to queue up for months
to book the vegetarian dishes here.

283
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,860
Vegetarian?

284
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,600
It takes several steps for them

285
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,930
to make vegetarian food
with special flavor,

286
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:10,330
to encourage us eating vegetarian food.

287
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:10,930
Yes.

288
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,360
I can have a try.

289
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,700
Ms. Su, you order first.

290
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,700
I'll go to the restroom.

291
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,160
Okay.

292
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,600
Director Li must be a vegetarian.

293
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,730
Probably he needs the vitamins from meat,

294
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:32,530
so when he sat down,

295
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:35,160
he had vitamin D and B.

296
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,700
I have asked you to find

297
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,200
out his preferences and taboos.

298
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:39,960
Sorry,

299
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,300
it's my mistake.

300
00:15:41,860 --> 00:15:43,530
I thought he grew up in Nanjing,

301
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:44,930
and this restaurant would be his taste.

302
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,060
You've been living abroad, haven't you?

303
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,530
Haven't you met this kind of people
before?

304
00:15:51,460 --> 00:15:53,960
I have few friends when I was abroad.

305
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,200
Cheer up!

306
00:15:56,200 --> 00:15:58,460
Ask the kitchen
to make some famous vegetarian dishes.

307
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:58,800
Okay!

308
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:00,330
Never have meat.

309
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,130
I know.

310
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:01,800
Don't mess up again.

311
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,460
Don't worry.

312
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,860
It's good to sleep here.

313
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,860
You don't need to deal with
troubles outside.

314
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:25,260
Actually,

315
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,260
Su Li doesn't know the things
I did behind her.

316
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:29,530
She thinks

317
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,160
that I was threatened

318
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,530
for protecting her.

319
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,700
She lost a million,

320
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,760
but she didn't blame on me.

321
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,160
She's such a nice person.

322
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,100
When you cheated on her earlier,

323
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,360
have you thought

324
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,000
there was a stone on your heart

325
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,330
and you were unable to breathe.

326
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,130
That's the deal.

327
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:19,900
Ms. Su,

328
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:20,760
thanks for your treat.

329
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,760
I'm looking forward to your story.

330
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,560
I must prepare it well.

331
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:25,160
Okay.

332
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,300
We'll leave now.

333
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:26,930
Goodbye, Director Li.

334
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:27,400
Goodbye.

335
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,260
What's the probability
that Director Li will cooperate with us?

336
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,500
90%?

337
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,360
We have many rivals.

338
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:41,060
All of them are senior scriptwriters.

339
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,330
Book me the earliest ticket back
for tomorrow morning.

340
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,330
I need to work out a plan quickly.

341
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:46,700
You've been talking all the time

342
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,600
without eating.

343
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:47,960
How about

344
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:50,000
getting something to eat?

345
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:50,400
I'm not hungry.

346
00:17:58,130 --> 00:17:59,900
I'll go back to the hotel
and order delivery.

347
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:01,600
We're already here.

348
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,560
I'll take you

349
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,860
to enjoy the hustle and bustle of life.

350
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:04,330
Trust me!

351
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,060
Come on. Let's go.

352
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,460
What hustle and bustle?

353
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,260
The food there is much more delicious.

354
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,400
Hello,

355
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:12,800
two bowls of beef noodles,

356
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,060
one with scallions and coriander.

357
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,260
one with more coriander but no coriander.

358
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,260
Also a sugared garlic
and a marinated dish.

359
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:17,930
Okay. Wait a moment.

360
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:18,400
Thank you.

361
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,560
This's the delicious food you mentioned?

362
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,960
Beef noodles here
are particularly delicious.

363
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,660
The Nanjing private menu we had just now

364
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,100
that cost thousands of yuan per person

365
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,160
is not worth mentioning

366
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,360
compared to this.

367
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,460
Really?

368
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,300
I lived here before.

369
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,300
I've been short of money for a while,

370
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,260
so I found this secret restaurant.

371
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:39,530
It's cheap and delicious.

372
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:40,900
And we can ask for extra noodles.

373
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,730
In the north, winter is particularly cold.

374
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:43,660
When I eat a bowl of noodles here,

375
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,730
I don't feel cold anymore.

376
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,560
- Here's your noodle.
- Thank you.

377
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:48,930
Thank you.

378
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:49,400
Here is yours.

379
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:50,660
You can ask for more if it's not enough.

380
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,500
It looks nice.

381
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,900
Come on. Taste it.

382
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:01,500
What do you think?

383
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:02,900
So delicious.

384
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,000
If you have a garlic now,

385
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,930
it feels amazing.

386
00:19:05,930 --> 00:19:06,900
I don't like it.

387
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,200
You're a scriptwriter.

388
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,300
A scriptwriter should experience
all tastes of life.

389
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,560
How does it say?

390
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,200
Noodles without garlics,
taste half reduced.

391
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:14,930
Have a try!

392
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:15,960
You don't have any appointments later.

393
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,800
I don't mind you.

394
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,560
Do you mind yourself?

395
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:19,960
Hurry!

396
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,460
Trust me.

397
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:20,900
Really.

398
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:32,530
Hurry up.

399
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:33,500
Have a mouthful of noodles.

400
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,700
And one more.

401
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,330
Eat up.

402
00:19:43,330 --> 00:19:44,460
Yours is getting cold.

403
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:44,760
Okay.

404
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:06,730
What happened?

405
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,330
I used to accompany Su Li
on business trips,

406
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,330
but she took someone else this time.

407
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,330
Tell me.

408
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:20,930
Do you think she finds out something?

409
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:22,360
Will she find someone to replace me?

410
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,960
Su Li's a dark horse.

411
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,460
Even if she knew something,

412
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,760
she would sit tight.

413
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,260
I don't worry

414
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,360
that she will find someone to replace you.

415
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:40,960
I fear that she may hurt you.

416
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,930
For our friendship,

417
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:49,360
she wouldn't do that to me, would she?

418
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,000
Have you forgotten Chen Yingying
and Zhang Shuheng?

419
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,130
Think about them.

420
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,300
How about

421
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,660
grabbing a big money

422
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,500
before she takes action?

423
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:03,860
Then we can just run away.

424
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,460
I have to think about it.

425
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:11,100
Although Su Li treated them so badly,

426
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,000
it was Zhang Shuheng
who made mistakes first.

427
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,300
I...

428
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,000
Honey.

429
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,200
I've been thinking about it
for a long time.

430
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,660
I don't want you to take risks anymore.

431
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,730
Especially I don't want

432
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:25,600
to watch you leading a life
in fear and stress anymore.

433
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:31,930
Let's find a place where nobody knows us

434
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:33,460
and lead a new life.

435
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,860
I'll earn money to support our family

436
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:37,200
and you can just rest and have fun.

437
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,400
A new life?

438
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:47,360
What will you do?

439
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:51,700
Even if I do nothing,

440
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:54,060
or do manual work on a site,

441
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,930
it's better than watching you
being tortured like this.

442
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:02,060
As long as we work together,

443
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:05,760
our life will surely get better again.

Do you feel uncomfortable

447
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,000
with high-heels for a day?

448
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,130
It's been a day.

449
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:27,180
It's a bit painful.

450
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:27,880
Well.

No.

453
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,680
I already owed you one favor

454
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,820
for shoes before.

455
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,550
Actually, it is common in life

456
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:41,880
that we are high and dry.

457
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,520
I can't ask for help every time waiting

458
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,380
for aids.

459
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:47,150
After all, I need to have a try on my own.

460
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:48,320
I'll only know

461
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,120
how it feels by coming down to earth.

462
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:53,380
Well.

Wait for a second.

00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:08,750
Change your shoes.

466

Give them to me.

467
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:21,420
Is it better?

468
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,150
Surely.

469
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,950
I think you're a little bit different
lately.

470
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:28,020
Why?

471
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:29,980
Let me see.

472
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:33,320
You seem

473
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:36,080
to have aged a bit.

474
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,020
I'm going to kill you!

475
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,020
It's a joke.

476
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:40,620
I find

477
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:44,120
that you always frown lately.

478
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:47,280
I heard it from news
that Zhang Shuheng had a car accident.

479
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,020
You must be sad.

480

My ex-husband leads a worse life than me.

481
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,550
I should be happy.

482
00:23:59,320 --> 00:23:59,980
Fine.

483
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:02,520
I just have mixed feelings.

484
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,420
These days,

485
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:08,580
I have met so many dramatic events.

486
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,680
Then I found out

487
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:13,320
that revenge queens in my stories

488
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,350
are actually not happy

489

after revenge succeeds.

490
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:19,950
I think

491
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,380
no one would want

492
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,880
to marry me
and enter the graveyard of love.

493
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,480
Who said that?

494
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,150
I do.

495

I don't have to drag others

498
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,980
into the graveyard with me.

499

Ms. Su,

521
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:05,740
I expect your performance.

522
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,510
At the End of Time.

523
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,580
When the end of the world comes,

524
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,680
and the world is full of monsters,

525
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:15,880
what will you do?

526
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:18,480
The hero is a typical office worker.

527
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,640
He lives a life line points,

528
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,730
dares not say "NO"
to unreasonable overtime.

529

He has a girlfriend.

They live in the same city
but can't see each other often.

I think today's idea meeting

00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,100
It's my original idea.

555
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,560
I have been working on it for days.

556
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,200
There must be some problems in this.

it may not be your problem,

561
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,460
sorry for that.

You'd better go back

The story frameworks
and storylines are totally the same.

569
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,560
There must be a mole in our company.

570
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,800
Su Li,

571
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,300
it can't be me.

572
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,600
What're you thinking?

573
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,160
How can I suspect you?

574
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:15,330
I tell you

575
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:17,600
because I want you to investigate
with me together.

576
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,000
Well, what should I do?

577
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,060
Keep quiet

578
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:26,330
and pretend that you know nothing.

579
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:27,600
Okay.

580
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:28,800
Go back.

581
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:29,730
Okay.

582
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,260
(Where're you?)

583
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:34,930
(I have a meal appointment.)

584
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,330
(I'm late.)

585
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,500
There's a small problem with my car.

586
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:39,660
It's all fixed up.

587
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:40,160
I am coming soon.

588
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:41,930
Well done.

589
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,660
I was right about you.

590
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,730
There's one more thing
that I need your help.

591
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,160
What?

592
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,130
Take intimate photos

593
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:02,260
with Su Li.

594
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,530
Why do you need that?

595
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,600
I'll make people believe
that they were taken before her divorce.

596
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,400
In doing so,

597
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
it will be tough for her.

598
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,200
Relax.

599
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:19,800
I'll give you more money.

600
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:21,660
You don't need to show your face.

601
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:22,930
No one will recognize you.

602
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:23,900
You said you wanted to set up Su Li.

603
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:25,360
It's enough now.

604
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,760
It's a big blow for her.

605
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,600
How about we all move forward?

606
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,560
And Su Li's not so bad as you said.

607
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,000
She has her reasons.

608
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,300
Do you know how evil she is?

609
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,730
I can't believe you feel sorry for her.

610
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:41,260
She trapped her ex-husband
into a vegetable.

611
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,360
He's still in hospital now.

612
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:43,930
And I...

613
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:44,500
You know how I am now.

614
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,260
It was an accident.

615
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,600
You can't actually think
you can be with Su Li, do you?

616
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,930
She is vicious and evil.

617
00:31:58,930 --> 00:32:00,260
She won't really like you,

618
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,460
even if you get benefits from her.

619
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:05,960
Our cooperation is over.

620
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:08,500
Have a guess.

621
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,800
If she knows

622
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:11,930
that you have something to do with it,

623
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,200
what will she do?

624
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,560
What actually you want me to do?

625
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:28,760
Without me,

626
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,600
you're just

627
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,800
a small actor leading a hard life.

628
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,360
Su Li would never notice you.

629
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:39,800
Acted as a rich second generation
for days,

630
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:41,460
you took it seriously?

631
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,930
You use my money

632
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:45,200
to act rich

633
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,600
and to be the man of Su Li.

634
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,530
You're whimsical.

635
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,200
I never thought about it.

636
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,330
I don't want the money.

637
00:32:56,130 --> 00:32:57,060
Even though you don't do it,

638
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:59,400
I can find someone else.

639
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:04,400
I must make her life a living hell.

640
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,560
As for what you've done to Su Li,

641
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,460
I'll exactly tell her.

642
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,330
She won't let you go.

643
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:23,880
