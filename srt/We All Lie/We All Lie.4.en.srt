00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:48,720
Besides,

179
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,260
the official Weibo account
for the new play is filled

180
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,490
with comments demanding changing
leading actor and actress.

181
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,760
It's over.

182
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,220
Everything is ruined.

183
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:31,490
Honey, I...

184
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,120
I trust you.

185
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,860
I said,

186
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,960
I believe there's nothing between you two.

187
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:44,520
These picture-based news stories
are completely untrustworthy.

188
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,860
One's my husband.

189
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:48,890
One's my bestie.

190
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:53,460
You are the people closest to me
in this world.

191
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,090
You don't need to explain.

192
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,690
I won't believe

193
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:02,160
that you could engage in such despicable,

194
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,090
sordid affairs, no better than animals.

195
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:09,120
Even if someone tried
to seduce my husband,

196
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,760
I also believe

197
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,860
that Shuheng will know what to do.

198
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:18,220
This whole thing is clearly someone trying

199
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,320
to set up a scheme,

200
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,260
aiming to frame and take over.

201
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,690
Yingying, do you think I'm right?

202
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:26,690
Su Li, this's really a misunderstanding.

203
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,320
Yeah, Honey.

204
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,060
I think it's very odd.

205
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:35,120
You see, we had a drink that night.

206
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,690
You were drunk and fell asleep.

207
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:38,980
As it happened, I was asked
for a script reading meeting.

208
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,820
Yingying and I arrived there early,

209
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,720
then the police came shortly after.

210
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,260
Honey, I'm worried you'll believe

211
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,260
those malicious comments online
with hidden motives.

212
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:51,520
I'm so touched

213
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:52,760
that you still trust me.

214
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:57,660
What a great wife.

215
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:01,260
Shuheng, you have to be nice to Su Li.
Do you hear me?

216
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,260
That's for sure.

217
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,360
Then the top priority now is

218
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,760
holding a press conference
as soon as possible.

219
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,890
You three clarify to the public

220
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:11,820
that it's a misunderstanding.

221
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:17,860
I agree,

222
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,520
but it's a temporary solution.

223
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,220
What I worry now is,

224
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,860
if Shuheng and Yingying

225
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,960
show up together in public
like they used to,

226
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,960
it will agitate
the irrational internet users.

227
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:31,890
How about this?

228
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,560
Shuheng, Yingying, I'm going to cancel

229
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,060
all your upcoming jobs for now.

230
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,260
I'll put a hold on all your current jobs,

231
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,490
including the new teleplay.

232
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:42,720
Once this scandal is over

233
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,180
and the public forgets about it,

234
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,780
it won't be late for you two to come back.

235
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,100
No.

236
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,660
I can compromise on anything

237
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:49,660
but the teleplay.

238
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:51,730
Su Li,

239
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,700
you got to trust me.

240
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,760
Don't panic, Yingying.

241
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,130
Given the current situation,

242
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:00,060
even if I step in to clarify for you,

243
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,160
do you really think the public is going
to accept actors like you two

244
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,330
who've stirred up such a scandal

245
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,800
to be in the same play?

246
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,760
For the big picture

247
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,500
and the long-term development
of both your careers,

248
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:11,900
I think

249
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,100
this is the best solution.

250
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:15,930
I agree.

251
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,130
Me too.

252
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,000
Honey, we're running out of time.

253
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,530
We should hurry up and think
about what to say at the press conference.

254
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,200
What's up?

255
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,130
Don't you find this whole thing fishy?

256
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:54,460
We happened to encounter a police check
at the hotel.

257
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:55,800
Now with our new play's filming
about to start,

258
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,730
this information just happened
to get exposed.

259
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:58,600
Plus,

260
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,660
Su Li almost never livestreams,

261
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,400
yet did it right at this critical time.

262
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,560
I strongly suspect

263
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:06,900
she deliberately cried
during the live stream.

264
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,530
She wants to blow things up

265
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,060
before swooping in faking being nice.

266
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:11,860
I think the one reporting this

267
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:14,460
and breaking the news
is none other than her.

268
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,460
If it was she,

269
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,800
why would she help us?

270
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:21,760
Because...

271
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,930
Yingying, get this straight,

272
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,860
we betrayed her,

273
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,300
not the other way around.

274
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,360
Instead of blaming or doubting us,

275
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,400
she is helping us.

276
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,760
She's such a kind person.

277
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,800
We should thank her
from the bottom of our hearts.

278
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:37,730
I...

279
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,800
Alright, Yingying,

280
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,200
you go home and get some rest.

281
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,600
Leave the next to me.

282
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,060
Honey, you've been busy all day.

283
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:04,760
You must be hungry.

284
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,300
I made some chicken soup.

285
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:09,900
If you're hungry,

286
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,660
I'll get it for you.

287
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:16,560
Honey,

288
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:24,960
you're so nice to me.

289
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,700
I'll get the soup.

290
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,660
The soup...

291
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,600
What? Doesn't it taste good?

292
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:52,460
I must have made a mistake in my haste.
Don't drink it if it's not good.

293
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,360
Who said it's not good?

294
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,130
It's absolutely delicious.

295
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:18,860
Tasty.

296
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:23,760
So tasty.

297
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:28,860
Come in.

298
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:31,500
Mr. Wu,

299
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,700
Mr. Zhang Shuheng's assistant is here

300
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,500
for the contract termination.

301
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:37,160
Ask her to see Zhu Li.

302
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,100
Okay.

303
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:39,530
Wait.

304
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,000
What's her name?

305
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,760
It's Wang Ganggang.

306
00:16:46,330 --> 00:16:47,530
Honey, what's your progress?

307
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:49,560
Come, look at the camera.

308
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:50,860
A video?

309
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,060
The yearly best couple.

310
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,860
Ask her to come to my office.

311
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,200
- I'll talk to her myself
- Okay.

312
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,500
How's Shuheng doing?

313
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,360
This scandal has quite an impact.

314
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:19,000
Don't worry.

315
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,760
I've known Shuheng for ages.

316
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,930
Take it easy.

317
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,200
Take a seat, I'll check the contract.

318
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:42,930
Mr. Wu,

319
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,800
is there a problem?

320
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:48,700
Who drafted it up?

321
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:50,500
I did.

322
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:53,130
What's wrong?

323
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,200
I thought we had an agreement

324
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:59,460
that the clause
of the artist's breach compensation

325
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,000
shall be deleted.

326
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,330
Why didn't you?

327
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,060
For your oversight, your boss have

328
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,400
to pay me extra two million yuan
as compensation.

329
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,060
No way.

330
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,980
[Mr. Wu signs.]

331
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:14,960
How could I

332
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,960
give it back to you?

333
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,900
Once I sign it,

334
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:20,260
I can easily get two million yuan.

335
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,900
Mr. Wu, I'll go back
and revise the contract now.

336
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:26,960
Sir, please have some mercy.

337
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,900
I can't afford that kind of money.

338
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,930
You fix the contract,

339
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:36,600
but I want to know how serious you are.

340
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,060
I'm a reasonable man.

341
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:44,760
One night.

342
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,760
I'll let it go.

343
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:48,330
No!

344
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,530
It's two million yuan.

345
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,900
It's a bad deal for me.

346
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,260
This is the greatest compromise
I can make.

347
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,300
Shuheng,

348
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,660
don't leave me.

349
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,860
I trust you.

350
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,000
Don't leave me.

351
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,560
Honey,

352
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,530
I won't leave you.

353
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,260
(I'm sorry, Shuheng.)

354
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,460
(It's my fault.)

355
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:40,730
(I shouldn't have misunderstood Su Li.)

356
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:42,530
(I won't do it again.)

357
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:43,730
(Don't give me a cold shoulder.)

358
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:02,860
Put more makeup on me.

359
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:04,700
I want the dark circles
under my eyes stand out

360
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:08,060
and look wearier overall.

361
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,130
Go to help Mr. Zhang touch
up his makeup a bit as well.

362

363
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:51,020
Please give us a straightforward response
to the current scandal.

364
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,620
Are you having an affair with Ms. Chen?

365
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:54,420
Ms. Su,

366
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:57,100
are you forced to help clean up the mess?

367
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:57,730
Ms. Chen Yingying,

368
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,780
has your friendship with Miss Su Li come
to an end?

369
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,530
How do you feel about having an affair
with your bestie's husband?

370
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:03,500
Well, please be quiet, everyone.

371
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:04,930
I assure everyone

372
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:07,460
that today we'll let everyone satisfied.

373
00:21:12,130 --> 00:21:13,260
Regarding yesterday's news,

374
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,860
I want to first apologize to all my fans,

375
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,960
the press,

376
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,600
my family and friends,

377
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,500
including Ms. Chen Yingying,

378
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:25,300
especially

379
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,530
my wife.

380
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:32,760
I'm grateful for the trust my wife gives
to me at the same time.

381
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,200
Honey, thank you.

382
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:39,960
On that day,

383
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:42,700
the crew asked us to be there
for a script reading meeting.

384
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,760
All major actors would attend,

385
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,260
but Ms. Chen Yingying and I arrived

386
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:49,660
at the hotel earlier than scheduled.

387
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:53,530
Due to my negligence
and a lack of awareness in avoiding

388
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,960
any appearance of impropriety,

389
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,860
I didn't understand
what a married man should do,

390
00:21:58,530 --> 00:21:59,860
and failed to handle appropriately

391
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,360
situations where I was alone

392
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,260
with a woman other than my wife,

393
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:06,800
which caused today's misunderstanding.

394
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,600
I've decided

395
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,500
to quit

396
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,060
the filming of the teleplay
Infidelity Must Die

397
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,660
and put a hold on all my work.

398
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,060
I'll reflect on my problems in private.

399
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:18,860
I promise

400
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:21,060
this will never happen again.

401
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:24,760
I also hope that all my fans

402
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,700
and the press can give me a second chance.

403
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:28,930
Thank you.

404
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:39,330
What's your comment on this, Ms. Su Li?

405
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,930
This's indeed a misunderstanding.

406
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,960
I know about the script reading meeting.

407
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,730
I absolutely believe there's nothing
between Shuheng and my bestie, Yingying.

408
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,660
First,

409
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,240
I'd like to offer my apology to everyone.

410
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,800
My inappropriate behaviors have led

411
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,170
to so many misunderstandings

412
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,640
and improperly occupied public resources.

413
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,000
I'm truly sorry.

414
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,570
I've decided to quit the leading actress
of the new play,

415
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,340
and temporarily leave
the entertainment industry.

416
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:05,740
It's alright now, Yingying.

417
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,900
Everyone, please trust Yingying.

418
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,420
She's still young

419
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,950
and realizes she made a mistake.

420
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,580
She told me

421
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,920
she wants to bow down for apology.

422
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:37,350
I'm sorry.

with some business.

Did you cheat, or was it your wife?

435

Neither.

436
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,130
I just feel

437
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:09,560
there's no love between us.

438
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,460
Now, it just feels we're more like
relatives or friends.

439
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:18,200
It's like eating the same dish
for every meal,

440

to get sick of it, right?

Staying with Ganggang

443
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,160
is already mercy to her.

I know you've been
through a hard time lately.

465
