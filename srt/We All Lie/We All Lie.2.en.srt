One glass is too much for me.

Mr. Wu, my wife is a lightweight
and I'll drink it for her.

39

Shuheng, we all know you never get drunk.

40
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:50,490
That's right. We all know
what a good drinker you are.

41
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:53,420
So you shouldn't drink it
in case you enjoy it too much.

42
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,120
Exactly.

about it?

It's so sudden. How do I bring it up?

59
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:02,690
If it's true,
asking about it will alert him.

60
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:07,420
If not, he'll think I don't trust him.

61
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,960

Nowadays, domestic cats don't catch mice
for food.

69
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:42,420
They don't kill them right away.

70
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:46,620
Instead, they get hooked on releasing them
and catching them again

71
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:51,660
until they completely break their defense,

72
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:55,020
making them give up resistance entirely

73
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:59,860

with one accurate bite.

74

the thrill of the hunt.

I'll make them wish they were dead.

77

but I made it with all my love.

183
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,200
That's why it's delicious.

184
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,200
The steak's delicious,

185
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,400
thanks to the big corporations' power.

186
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:35,960
The steak sauce's from the supermarket.

187
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,160
You do know your steaks.

188
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,600
Well,

189
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,130
how'd you punish me?

190
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,960
I love you too much

191
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,600
to ever hurt you.

192
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,300
Really?

193
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,200
What if you don't love me anymore?

194
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,400
Don't be silly.

195
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,400
Are you saying you don't love me anymore?

196
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,560
Of course I do.

197
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,860
I love you so much

198
00:17:08,860 --> 00:17:10,590
that I could kill you.

199
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,160
I'm joking.

200
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,460
Let's make a toast.

201
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:27,800
Love you.

202
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:42,860
The wine isn't what we used to drink.

203
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,930
I switched to a new brand.

204
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,560
What? Does it taste bad?

205
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:47,930
It's pretty good.

206
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,660
I like it.

207
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,160
Great, we'll drink this brand from now on.

208
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:03,730
OK.

209
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,230
Cheers.

210
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:14,600
Honey.

211
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:27,400
Honey?

212
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,200
Honey,

213
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:51,760
love you.

215
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,760
