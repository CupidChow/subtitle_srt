00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:21,800
Do you think you can handle

193
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,330
on your own?

194
00:13:23,130 --> 00:13:25,260
Maybe we have to spend extra money
and resources

195
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,330
to maintain your influence.

196
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,100
And the cheating scandal

197
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,330
between you

198
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:32,400
and Chen Yingying is like a ticking bomb.

199
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,960
It may go off at any second.

200
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,760
A star with lapsed morals like you,

201
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:36,500
who sabotages the company,

202
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,760
retaliates coworkers
and has a indiscreet private life,

203
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,200
which company would dare to hire?

204
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,460
Zhao Wen,

205
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,700
say something.

206
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,860
You've been my agent for years.

207
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,330
Don't you know me?

208
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:50,530
I'm nothing but loyal to the company.

209
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:56,330
Loyal?

210
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,160
That's the funniest thing I've ever heard.

211
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,060
Just a few days ago,

212
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,900
I saw you meeting with another company.

213
00:14:06,130 --> 00:14:06,800
Don't tell me

214
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,730
you were just having some tea with them.

215
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,460
Fine.

216
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,460
You all set me up.

217
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,060
You make it hard for me

218
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,130
and I'll make you all suffer.

219
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,000
Where are you going?

220
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:45,930
Why are you in my car?

221
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:47,930
Did you report me

222
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,530
about leaking Lu's remuneration?

223
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,900
Shuheng, hear me out.

224
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:57,930
I never meant for it to happen.

225
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,160
And I didn't know it was you
at the beginning.

226
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,530
If...

227
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:02,360
What if?

228
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:06,760
If Su Li didn't threaten me

229
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:07,400
and asked me to report you,

230
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,930
I would never do so.

231
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,100
Su Li?

232
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,500
I'm telling the truth.

233
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:18,160
Su Li...

234
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:20,800
wants to doom me to death.

235
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:25,400
It hurts.

236
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:27,530
I'm come after you later.

237
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,740
[Writing Magic of Love Stories
Speaker: Su Li]

238
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:47,600
Ms. Su Li,

239
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,960
twenty minutes left.

240
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,500
I want to add a video

241
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,500
before the first scene...

242
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,060
Su Li.

243
00:16:57,730 --> 00:16:58,800
We have something private to talk about.

244
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:02,960
You agreed

245
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:04,560
to divorce amicably.

246
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,530
Why you still come after me?

247
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,700
You even promised not to betray me.

248
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,460
How's that turning out?

249
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:17,460
Yes.

250
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:19,660
I cheated on you.

251
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,660
But what's the point
of scheming against me

252
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,660
endlessly?

253
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,260
I thought

254
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,260
getting in a relationship is

255
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,800
for mutual support.

256
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:35,130
Who'd know

257
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:37,100
you're the one who betrayed me.

258
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,130
What does it take for you to stop?

259
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:49,160
I want you to die,

260
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,400
to go to hell.

261
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:53,760
Su Li,

262
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:55,800
don't cross the line.

263
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,460
If you push me too hard,

264
00:17:57,930 --> 00:17:59,800
who knows what I might do?

265
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,260
Go!

266
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,400
Go to explain everything to Mr. Li!

267
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,900
Tell him you're behind all of this!

268
00:18:05,530 --> 00:18:08,130
What's wrong with pushing you?

269
00:18:08,130 --> 00:18:09,700
You're a spineless

270
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,860
coward

271
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,260
who's been living off me

272
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:13,860
and relying on me to give you work.

273
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:14,330
Without me,

274
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:16,260
you're nothing.

275
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:19,000
Even dogs know to wag their tails
at their owners,

276
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,730
you only know to bark at me.

277
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:26,200
Shut up.

278
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,530
Call the police.

279
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:42,530
Call the police.

280
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,530
According to People's Republic of China's

281
00:20:17,530 --> 00:20:19,100
Public Security Administration
Punishment Law,

282
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,260
I'm here to mediate the dispute
between you.

283
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,330
Ms. Su,

284
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:24,260
do you have any demands?

285
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:25,460
Yes.

286
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,300
I demand

287
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:29,500
severe punishment for the criminal.

288
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,860
Throw Zhang Shuheng in jail
for reflection.

289
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:34,130
Officer,

290
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:36,460
she set me up.

291
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,530
Calm down.

292
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:39,500
You have to know you're at fault.

293
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,000
It's you who wants to apologize

294
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,800
to get the victim to forgive you

295
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,130
to lessen the punishment.

296
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:47,960
I'm sorry, Su Li.

297
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:50,660
I apologize

298
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:52,360
for my negligent conduct.

299
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:56,260
So you realize you were wrong?

300
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:56,960
Well,

301
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,060
adults should take responsibility
for their mistakes

302
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,760
and prison is the best place
for you to end up.

303
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,600
Don't cross the line.

304
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,760
I'm out of the line?

305
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,660
I'm not as heartless as you

306
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:08,860
to go after your own baby.

307
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,130
Baby...

308
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:13,900
What's wrong with the baby?

309
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,100
Cut the acting.

310
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,560
We owe you an Oscar award
for the performance.

311
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:23,900
Su Li,

312
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,000
I don't know what you're talking about.

313
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,930
There must be a misunderstanding.

314
00:21:27,930 --> 00:21:28,800
Let me out.

315
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,130
I can surely give you
a proper explanation.

316
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,060
Renowned actor

317
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,660
beats his wife

318
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,500
and cheats on her.

319
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,260
Do you think

320
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:47,860
there's a future for you?

321
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:56,560
I'll make sure everyone knows

322
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,930
about it.

323
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,000
Su Li,

324
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,400
how vicious you are!

325
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:08,000
I won't let you get away with this.

326
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:40,530
Su Li,

327
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:41,460
get some rest.

328
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,330
I'll get you some water.

329
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:55,460
Here you are.

330
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:57,700
Thank you.

331
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,460
Su Li,

332
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:06,460
are you OK?

333
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:09,760
Yes.

334
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,660
I'll sleep it off.

335
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,560
Go back and have some rest, too.

336
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,360
I'll go.

337
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,130
Good night.

338
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,300
Why are you here again?

339
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,300
I still left something

340
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:04,700
at home.

341
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:07,700
I thought you took everything last time.

342
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,560
Check it out.

343
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,100
Take them all.

344
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:22,860
Ganggang,

345
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:25,300
I'm sorry

346
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,460
for what I did in the past.

347
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:28,400
If you're here for me to take you back.

348
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,330
Drop the idea already.

349
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,500
If you want what's the best for me,

350
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,460
then leave me alone.

351
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:35,130
I'm busy.

352
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:47,300
You're injured.

353
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,330
Sit down.

354
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,160
Sit down.

355
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:53,730
Are you okay?

356
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:54,800
I'm okay.

357
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,560
I'll get the medical kit.

358
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,200
Honey.

359
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:58,800
Honey,

360
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,200
I'm sorry.

361
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:04,530
I didn't realize what a good woman
you are.

362
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,400
I knew I made a mistake.

363
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,400
While I was away,

364
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,660
no one tucked me in,

365
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,000
or made me my favorite dishes.

366
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:16,960
Then I know how good you're good to me.

367
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,500
I never cherished you.

368
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:33,530
Well, unfortunately,

369
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:35,900
we can't change what has already happened.

370
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,700
Honey,

371
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,600
I can make amends.

372
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,130
Please trust me.

373
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:44,560
I'll be extra good to you.

374
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,560
Beat me.

375
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:49,260
Beat me or curse at me, whatever.

376
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,060
Don't be like this.

377
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:51,260
You can punish me whatever you like.

378
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:53,930
Just don't kick me out.

379
00:25:53,930 --> 00:25:54,600
Please.

380
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:56,900
Please.

381
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,730
I'll tend to your wound first.

382
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,130
Give me a second chance.

383
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,100
Please.

384
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:26,380
I...

385
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,060
I forgive you.

386
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:32,700
Really?

387
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,900
Coming.

388
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,500
Ms. Su.

389
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,160
Ms. Su,

390
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,900
Zhang Shuheng really had an affair
with Chen Yingying?

391
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,200
Are you divorced?

392
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,400
Ms. Su, will you press charges
against Zhang Shuheng?

393
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:11,560
Ms. Su, please give us an answer.

394
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:13,300
I used to think

395
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:15,460
Zhang Shuheng was the man I want

396
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,300
to spend my life with.

397
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:18,730
Chen Yingying

398
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,900
was my best friend.

399
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:24,400
How could I know

400
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,260
they could betray me together.

401
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,730
I'm in terrible pain.

402
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,060
I thought about ending my life.

403
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,860
But it's over now.

404
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:40,900
I heard Zhang Shuheng got detention
of 15 days.

405
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,530
Why did he take a swing at you?

406
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,930
Shuheng hasn't has the best of luck
at work,

407
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,000
so he asked for my help.

408
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:50,860
But I'm going through a rough patch too,

409
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,200
so I turned him down.

410
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:55,960
He probably just lost his temper
for a moment.

411
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:57,560
I thought

412
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,860
he may have stopped loving me
a long time ago.

413
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,260
Who knew he was a jerk.

414
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,960
Scumbag. It's horrible.

415
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,360
What a jerk he is.

416
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,500
Shuheng said

417
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,700
he'll leave all property to me

418
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,460
as a way of making up to me.

419
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,560
I believe

420
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,460
he'll act up to it.

421
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:23,760
Yingying,

422
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,460
[Zhang Shuheng promised to leave
all property to Su Li.]

423
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,460
[Su Li forgives Chen Yingying]
I hope you can start over,

424
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,600
[and sent her a message:]
turn over a new leaf.

425
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,660
[I hope you can start over.]
Don't hurt others.

426
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,560
We have

427
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,330
decided

428
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:37,160
to terminate contract

429
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,060
with Zhang Shuheng

430
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,360
and pressed charges against him.

431
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,130
During our contract,

432
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:44,160
Zhang Shuheng

433
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:45,960
has committed acts

434
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:50,000
that violate both morality and the law.

435
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:50,800
(Now,)

436
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,260
(all his endorsements)

437
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,460
[Xingtu Entertainment boss furiously ends]
and business activities

438
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,530
[contract with Zhang Shuheng,]
have been canceled,

439
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:57,960
[Zhang Shuheng faces a large sum
of compensation.]

440
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,860
(which caused significant negative impact)

441
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:01,760
(and financial losses to us.)

442
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,730
We'll sue for compensation.

443
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:23,620
[Zhang Shuheng's cheating confirmed!
The other woman is the wife's bestie.]

444
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,920
[It grosses me out.
A jerk and a mistress.]

445
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,230
[Guard against your besties.]

446
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:27,540
[Su Li's in a tough situation, betrayed
by the two closest ones to her.]

447
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,560
[That bitch won't get away with it.]

448
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,660
(Get out of the entertainment industry.)

449
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,200
(She knowingly becomes the mistress.)

450
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,260
(What a shameless.)

451
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,360
(What a pretentious sub girl.)

452
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,360
(I thought Su Li's party)

453
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,900
(of Zhang Shuheng's cheating.)

454
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,530
(Su Li's too domineering.)

455
00:29:44,060 --> 00:29:46,600
(Chen Yingying's younger,
prettier and more gentle.)

456
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:48,530
(It's understandable)

457
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,760
(Zhang Shuheng choose Chen Yingying.)

458
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:55,200
(To the user above,)

459
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,530
(get your eyes checked.)

460
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:57,960
(What a way to twist the truth.)

461
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,660
(Are you Chen Yingying's secret account?)

462
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:05,360
(I'm your mother!)

463
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:15,760
Madam,

464
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,400
how can I help you?

465
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,930
If I'm not mistaken,

466
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,330
you're

467
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:20,930
the "greatest mistress"

468
00:30:20,930 --> 00:30:22,460
from the news,

469
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:23,330
Chen Yingying, right?

470
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:26,360
What are you doing?

471
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:29,000
Getting in my room

472
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,500
without permission is violating privacy.

473
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,500
It's illegal, you know?

474
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:35,130
We live in an age

475
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,700
where a mistress is so brazen.

476
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,930
How shameless are you!

477
00:30:40,330 --> 00:30:40,860
Right.

478
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,600
Shameless.

479
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,000
I own the apartment.

480
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,730
I'm here to notify you

481
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:47,460
I won't be renting this house to you
anymore.

482
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,560
Move out now, please.

483
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:49,600
Why?

484
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,660
I have a lease.

485
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:52,960
It's not expired yet.

486
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:53,460
I'm not moving.

487
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:54,460
You have to.

488
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,700
I'll compensate you

489
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,700
for deposit and penalty.

490
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,360
Let me tell you,

491
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,560
we are representatives

492
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,960
of the homeowners' association.

493
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:06,100
Ever since we were elected,

494
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,130
our apartment complex has been named

495
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:09,100
Outstanding Residential Complex

496
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,600
in the city for two years in a row.

497
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,960
The honors are the result

498
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,660
of all homeowners' collective efforts.

499
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:18,660
Now, because of one bad apple,

500
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,130
our complex's reputation

501
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:21,560
has been tainted.

502
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,130
As representatives,

503
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:25,660
we won't allow it to happen.

504
00:31:25,930 --> 00:31:26,600
What did you say?

505
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,360
I'm a bad apple?

506
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:31,130
It will be an insult to apples.

507
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:32,700
Check the internet

508
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:34,330
and see how they curse at you.

509
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,560
Not moving?

510
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,660
Bring it on.

511
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,820
[Move. A mistress lives here.]

512
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:43,900
This way.

513
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:47,000
Oh, let it go.

514
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,530
Are you leaving or not?

515
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,800
Get out.

516
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,900
Or I'll resort to violence.

517
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:53,730
You shrew!

518
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:56,260
You have two days to move out.

519
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,000
Let's go.

520
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,330
We'll take a look at Room 903 downstairs.

521
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:00,530
They have a dog

522
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:01,900
that barks all day.

523
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,060
But that's easy to fix.

524
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:06,300
The dog is a real dog.

525
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,760
But someone

526
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,330
isn't a real human being.

527
00:32:09,330 --> 00:32:10,200
Are you leaving or not?

528
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:26,700
Sorry.

529
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:28,600
Where are you looking at?

530
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,130
You're that mistress.

531
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,060
Sure lacks class.

532
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:37,360
Your sweetheart has been put in jail,

533
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,560
what are you showing off here?

534
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:52,700
Serves you right.

535
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,530
Leave.

536
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,700
Get out.

537
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:06,930
How have you been?

538
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:09,730
Help me talk to Mr. Wu.

539
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,360
He has connections.

540
00:34:12,130 --> 00:34:12,730
Already did.

541
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,200
His secretary said he was abroad

542
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,500
and can't come back for now.

543
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:18,160
What about

544
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:18,760
Mr. Zhang?

545
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:20,300
Family matters.

546
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,700
He can't break free.

547
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:25,160
These bastards.

548
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:28,530
When I was in the prime,

549
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:29,900
they asked about me every day.

550
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,900
Now I'm in jail,

551
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,000
they can't wait to stay away from me.

552
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,130
Shuheng,

553
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,500
let's break up.

554
00:34:49,930 --> 00:34:50,600
You also want to

555
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:54,460
give me a hard time
while I'm already down?

556
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,860
Me giving you a hard time?

557
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:01,460
Your face...

558
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,330
What happened?

559
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,300
I don't know what to do.

560
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,600
I'm hated by everyone like a public enemy.

561
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,160
Let's break up.

562
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,660
It's all thanks to Su Li.

563
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:25,900
Someday,

564
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,130
I'll make her pay back.

565
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,760
Su Li told me

566
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,700
she lost the baby.

567
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:43,730
Does it have anything to do with you?

568
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:45,400
You still believe her?

569
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,860
She's up to something.

570
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:51,330
Yingying,

571
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:52,160
I trust you.

572
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:54,800
Don't leave me, please.

573
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,930
If you leave me,

574
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:57,360
I'll have nothing left.

575
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,100
You didn't have anything to begin with.

576
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:19,260
Who told you to spend money on tutoring?

577
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,130
You're getting bolder.

578
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:23,160
I didn't use your money.

579
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,700
Then where does it come from?

580
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:27,130
Grandma slipped it to me all these years.

581
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:28,700
I also helped classmates
write their homework

582
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,960
and they paid me.

583
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,000
Your grandma gave you money?

584
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,460
Your baby brother's shoes are so worn out.

585
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:34,530
She doesn't bear to buy a new pair.

586
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:35,460
How could she give you money?

587
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,700
Baby brother.

588
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,360
All you talk about is him.

589
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:39,960
What about me?

590
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,660
Aren't I your kid?

591
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,960
His shoes are worn out.

592
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,960
What about me?

593
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,300
My clothes and shoes are worn out too.

594
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:47,960
Even since he's born,

595
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,460
you never bought me new clothes.

596
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,130
When the teacher asked what my dream was,

597
00:36:52,130 --> 00:36:53,600
I wouldn't dare to tell her.

598
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,100
Because I don't deserve it.

599
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,330
I just want to go to school
like other kids.

600
00:36:57,330 --> 00:36:59,100
Just like other kids.

601
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,660
Why is it so hard?

602
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:01,360
Right.

603
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,500
You're right.

604
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,530
You know you don't deserve it.

605
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:04,960
What's with all the talking?

606
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,060
Starting tomorrow,

607
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,560
write more homework for your classmates

608
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,900
and give me all the money.

609
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,300
You don't deserve it.

610
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,260
Who are you talking to?

611
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:12,860
You.

612
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,500
You don't deserve to be a mother.

613
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,860
Check the calendar.

614
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,360
What age do we live in?

615
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,130
You still play the heavy gender bias game.

616
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:21,300
As a mother,

617
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,460
you can't even respect her.

618
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:26,360
All she wants is living like other kids.

619
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,060
But in front of her own mother,

620
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,330
she don't even have

621
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,500
the right

622
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:32,130
to enjoy equal respect like other kids.

623
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:51,420
Good morning.

624
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:03,860
We've been an old couple.

625
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:04,820
Don't do this.

626
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:08,320
That's more reason we should do it.

627
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:13,060
Honey,

628
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,180
thanks for letting me home.

629
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:22,700
Thanks for the flower.

630
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,170
We're going to a movie,

631
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:27,070
an exhibition,

632
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:28,870
and a candlelight dinner.

633
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:31,130
The time's actually pretty tight,

634
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:33,030
because you have to freshen up
and put on makeup.

635
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:34,570
It takes a while to get ready,

636
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:34,970
right?

637
00:38:42,030 --> 00:38:43,600
Ms. Chen, I'm here to collect the key.

638
00:38:44,830 --> 00:38:45,230
Ms. Chen...

640
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:54,400
Ms. Chen.

641
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,270
