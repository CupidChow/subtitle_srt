He might have got inflamed.

192
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,760
This medicine can help relieve
inflammation.

193
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,090
Just take it back

194
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,720
to your husband.

195
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,220
Once a day,

196
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,090
one pill each time.

197
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,360
Stop it when he's cured.

198
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:48,490
The side effects are mild.

199
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,690
He might sometimes feel more sleepy

200
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,360
and sometimes feel more sentimental.

201
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:54,460
I see.

202
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,120
No.

203
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,220
It's my friend's husband.

204
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,860
Not my friend.

205
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:05,490
It's my friend's husband.

206
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:06,290
Scan to pay,

207
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:08,020
one hundred yuan.

208
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,490
Honey.

209
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:15,950
Honey.

210
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,350
Why do you have bad breath?

211
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:23,820
Do I?

212
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,520
Do you recently have dry mouth

213
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,920
and tongue,

214
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:29,920
short temper, as well as ulcers

215
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,320
in your mouth?

216
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,480
It seems to be true.

217
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:35,980
You've got inflamed.

218
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,460
Wait a minute.

219
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,060
This can help.

220
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,280
Take four pills.

221
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,940
You really care about me.

222
00:11:59,120 --> 00:11:59,980
I'll take a bath.

223
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,020
Okay.

224
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,350
I'll wait for you in bed.

225
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,530
Ms. Su,

226
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,660
please have a look.

227
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:13,560
Which one do you like?

228
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:14,600
Up to you.

229
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,260
It's just a film premiere.

230
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,100
Just be simple.

231
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:17,660
Okay.

232
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,300
No, I disagree.

233
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:19,900
Let me see.

234
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,400
I think this suits you a lot.

235
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:31,460
It's elegant

236
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:33,100
and won't steal the leading actress's
thunder.

237
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,160
Isn't it?

238
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,560
I'll take it.

239
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:37,330
Okay.

240
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,360
We choose this one.

241
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:40,100
Great.

242
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,300
It's a little wrinkled here.
Fix it up for us, please.

243
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,000
Got it.

244
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,000
Ms. Su,

245
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,730
your husband really loves you.

246
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,730
Normally when girls do the makeup,

247
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:52,200
very few men would be so patient like him.

248
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:53,930
Really?

249
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,330
Honey,

250
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:08,930
you're so beautiful.

251
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:17,800
Really.

252
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:23,930
Honey,

253
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,500
you're so beautiful.

254
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,460
Let's go.

255
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:06,420
[The Space Wandering
Global Premiere]

256
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,930
The new works are so good.

257
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:08,660
The box office will be huge.

258
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:10,530
Yes, I think so.

259
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:11,700
Director?

260
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:14,000
Director.

261
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:17,160
Hello,

262
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,300
I really like your works.

263
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:19,860
Thank you.

264
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,140
Is that right?

265
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,300
Let's have hotpot tonight, Director Jia.

266
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,300
- Okay.
- Let's celebrate it.

267
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,580
No...I'll pass...

268
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,530
Director.

269
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,330
Ms. Su.

270
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:32,160
Congratulations.

271
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,930
Congratulations for a box office hit.

272
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:35,000
Thank you.

273
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:36,200
Congratulations, Director.

274
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,400
Don't leave after the film.

275
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,400
I've ordered a place

276
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:40,730
for supper.

277
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,060
Shuheng and I didn't eat today,
just waiting for it.

278
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:46,460
Su Li,

279
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:47,500
you're also here.

280
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:48,900
Yingying,

281
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,900
you're here. I didn't notice you.

282
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,130
You know each other?

283
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,760
Director, this is my bestie,
Chen Yingying.

284
00:15:58,060 --> 00:15:59,400
You must have been too busy

285
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,930
for rumors.

286
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:03,460
We've had a ridiculous scandal.

287
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,930
There was a scandal
between Shuheng and Yingying.

288
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:07,200
It's so funny, right?

289
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:08,560
The fake news nowadays

290
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,000
are just ridiculous.

291
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,000
Those journalists are unscrupulous.

292
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:14,160
Yingying has her boyfriend.

293
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,860
Director, they've been waiting for you.

294
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:18,560
Okay.

295
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,200
- Excuse me.
- Okay.

296
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:20,860
Go ahead please.

297
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:21,730
Go ahead, Director.

298
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,160
Yingying,

299
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,700
why are you here by yourself?

300
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,730
Where's your boyfriend?

301
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,560
You had a fight because of the scandal,
didn't you?

302
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:31,760
No,

303
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:32,560
he's busy today.

304
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,700
Busy again?

305
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,330
He has something to hide?

306
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,130
Just tell him.

307
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:43,160
that even an ugly boyfriend should see
his girlfriend's bestie.

308
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:44,200
Right?

309
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,130
Isn't it, Shuheng?

310
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,360
Yes.

311
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:51,730
Another day.

312
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,260
You'll meet him another day.

313
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,330
Which day is another day?

314
00:16:55,330 --> 00:16:56,760
I'm available recently.

315
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,960
Make an appointment with him.

316
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,700
Let's fix the date now.

317
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:01,060
Honey,

318
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,660
the film is about to start.

319
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:03,500
Let's go inside.

320
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:04,300
Okay.

321
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:05,530
Let's go, Yingying.

322
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,060
Okay.

323
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,460
I didn't think Director Jia's film can
be this fun.

324
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,260
Director Jia's design is delicate.

325
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,400
(He might sometimes feel more sleepy)

326
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,160
(and sometimes feel more sentimental.)

327
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:39,300
And after that?

328
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,730
The drug is strong.

329
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:43,460
Zhang Shuheng went back home

330
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:44,960
with his eyes red for quite a long time.

331
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,560
Chen Yingying must be angry seeing

332
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,930
you two hugging all the time.

333
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,900
I didn't want that,

334
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:55,460
but it made me feel great seeing her

335
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:56,600
so angry.

336
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,730
This one looks good.

337
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:06,260
Try it.

338
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,530
The lip color can be redder

339
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,930
and your hair can be

340
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,300
tied up like this.

341
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,360
Be clean.

342
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,060
The eyeliner can be longer.
You don't look resolute enough.

343
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:34,300
Sill not enough?

344
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,760
What's the most important thing
for negotiation?

345
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,930
A overwhelming attitude.

346
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,330
(You can lose, but not your attitude.)

347
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,960
(Firm eyes are really important.)

348
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,320
Ms. Wang,

349
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,380
why are you

350
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,020
here today?

351
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:02,980
I'm coming to sign the contract with you.

352
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,180
The contract?

353
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,120
You mean the contract last time?

354
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:15,350
I've already signed it.

355
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:17,580
What else do I need to sign?

356
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,950
What if he refuses to sign it?

357
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:23,020
Here are related legal terms I found
for you.

358
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:24,020
Memorize them.

359
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:28,520
If the contract's content doesn't reflect
both sides' will,

360
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,380
it can be revised through negotiation.

361
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,480
Either side can cancel the contract based
on major misunderstandings.

362
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,720
The contract shall reflect the will
of both sides.

363
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,780
If there are mistakes in the contract,

364
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,950
either side shall negotiate actively
with the other

365
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,220
to reach a consensus

366
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,880
and amend the mistakes,

367
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,180
with signatures and seals.

368
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:48,980
If it can't be solved through negotiation,

369
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,550
we'll bring an action to solve it.

370
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,980
At that time, we'll present

371
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,180
to the court the text message

372
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,280
of the terms we've agreed to delete.

373
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:00,320
We believe
the judge will give us a fair judgement.

374
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:06,020
Okay.

375
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,020
Just bring an action.

376
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:09,980
I have time, anyway.

377
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,380
Just wait for the court's decision.

378
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:15,480
Mr. Wu,

379
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,550
I hope you can work with me.

380
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,350
If you keep putting me in a pickle,

381
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,880
I might get anxious

382
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:23,880
and accidentally

383
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:26,520
disclose the harassment message
you've sent me.

384
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:29,420
My personal reputation
doesn't worth a bit.

385
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:32,580
But if this news of harassing
a female staff

386
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,280
of your partner company

387
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,620
got disclosed,

388
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:38,580
it won't end well as your company's image

389
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,550
and development will be damaged.

390
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,080
Sign it.

391
00:21:58,950 --> 00:21:59,520
Be smart.

392
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:21,780
Su Li,

393
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,180
I did it!

394
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,220
Your husband won't mind, will he?

395
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:27,620
It's okay.

396
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:30,120
He's busy with work
and usually comes back late.

397
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:31,780
Su Li,

398
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,020
just have a sit outside.

399
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,180
I can do this quickly.

400
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,380
Let me help you.

401
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,550
My cooking is not good,

402
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:38,950
but I usually...

403
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,720
helped him in the kitchen before.

404
00:22:45,750 --> 00:22:47,980
Well, help me wash the abalone.

405
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,420
All right.

406
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,350
I have to go to the restroom first.

407
00:22:51,550 --> 00:22:52,150
I'll be quick.

408
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:01,280
Su Li, what have you done

409
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,220
to the abalone?

410
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,220
Whitening needles

411
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,150
or laser resurfacing?

412
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,480
I just washed it.

413
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,480
It's so white.

414
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,950
It feels like their skins are off.

415
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,880
Is white good or not?

416
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:19,880
Take a guess.

417
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:22,950
Congratulations to your success
in the negotiation.

418
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,150
Thank you.

419
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:29,780
I want to have a try.

420
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:30,620
Eat it.

421
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,080
Emmm.

422
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,580
So delicious.

423
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,780
Wow, you cook so well.

424
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,350
Your husband must love you a lot,

425
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:42,320
a beautiful young wife.

426
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:46,580
Su Li,

427
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:47,980
do you know?

428
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,720
This two years' marriage

429
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:51,880
has made me

430
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,420
realize

431
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,780
that a girl loving woolgathering
shouldn't be

432
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,420
with a man

433
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,720
who doesn't like expressing his feelings.

434
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:05,020
You may have a mental breakdown
at 4:30 AM,

435
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,150
while he just sleeps
and wakes up as usual.

436
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:10,820
Has anything

437
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,350
happened?

438
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,220
My husband

439
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,750
has been growingly cold to me.

440
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,280
We basically have little communication.

441
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,620
Do you now?

442
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,780
His company just secured funding

443
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,350
and will celebrate it with a feast
tomorrow.

444
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,280
But yesterday,

445
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,320
I got to know it

446
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,280
from a friend by chance.

447
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,750
He's never talked about it.

448
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:42,550
I...

449
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:43,680
I understand.

450
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,180
He just thinks I'm too ordinary,

451
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,150
embarrassing to take me out.

452
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:52,680

What?

455
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,980
I'll take you to stun them.

456
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:20,520
Miss,

457
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,020
I might have picked your keys.

458
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:25,620
Thank you.

459
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,120
You also live here?

460
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,320
Where are your parents?

461
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:31,020
They've taken my little brother
to the amusement park.

462
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,220
Why haven't they taken you?

463
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:37,620
They love my little brother more.

464
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,780
Since my little brother's birth,

465
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:42,080
they no longer love me.

466
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:46,150
Sweetheart,

467
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:47,880
is the amusement park exciting?

468
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:50,150
They are back.

469
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:51,280
I have to go home,

470
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,480
or they'll scold me.

471
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:05,520

You didn't tell her anything, right?
