00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:49,600
Su Li?

377
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:51,530
Su Li?

378
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,900
What did you just say?

379
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,300
Do you have anything on your mind?

380
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,500
I found out

381
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,900
that Zhang Shuheng lied to me.

382
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,500
What kind of lies?

383
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:10,730
You don't think he's cheating on you,
do you?

384
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:13,300
Then why didn't he tell me the truth?

385
00:21:13,330 --> 00:21:14,760
This is an occupational disease,

386
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,660
being suspicious.

387
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:20,060
Even I who don't know your husband well

388
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:23,060
know how much he loves you.

389
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:25,060
He only has eyes for you.

390
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,460
The places he's in

391
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,060
are empty

392
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:32,230
of female birds,

393
00:21:32,230 --> 00:21:34,500
let alone young ladies.

394
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,060
He won't cheat on you.

395
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,900
Why are you so exaggerating?

396
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,660
Just stop here.

397
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,900
Don't need to see you in?

398
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,760
No.

399
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,860
Your car is full of sour smell of love.

400
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,260
I can't bear it.

401
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,260
You just bully me
as my boyfriend is not here.

402
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:55,600
Speaking about your boyfriend,

403
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,730
you've been with each other for so long,

404
00:21:56,730 --> 00:21:58,060
but I haven't seen him once.

405
00:21:58,060 --> 00:21:59,330
You have no excuse for this.

406
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,700
He's too busy

407
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,000
and he's often abroad.

408
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:04,800
Next time.

409
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:06,530
I'll show him to you next time.

410
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:07,330
I'm leaving.

411
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,560
Be careful while driving.

412
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:09,600
Bye.

413
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:38,980
[I miss you]

414
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:12,700
Turn around.

415
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,160
Honey,

416
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,330
sorry for letting you wait so long.

417
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:54,760
I've had a temporary meeting,

418
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,860
didn't have the time to tell you.

419
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,360
Were you really at a meeting?

420
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:07,860
Yes.

421
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,800
Do you really need such strong perfume
for a meeting?

422
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,860
I wear perfume every day.

423
00:24:18,930 --> 00:24:20,160
The perfume you use

424
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,900
only lasts three to four hours.

425
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:23,930
The top notes are cardamom,

426
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:25,860
middle notes vetiver grass,

427
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:27,400
base notes moss amber.

428
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,130
Just have a smell of yourself.

429
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:31,800
It's all the smell of cardamom.

430
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,330
You must've used a lot of perfume
before heading home.

431
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,060
What are you covering?

432
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,340
Have you cheated on me?

433
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:53,700
I was really at a meeting.

434
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,900
They all smoked at the meeting.

435
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,340
I know you don't like the smoke smell.

436
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:00,370
If you don't trust me,

437
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:01,540
just ask them.

438
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,500
Ask Mr. Wu?

439
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,370
It's Mr. Wu again.

440
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:09,240
What a coincidence,

441
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,340
I met Mr. Wu's wife

442
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,340
on my way back home.

443
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:12,900
She told me

444
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,340
Mr. Wu had broken his leg.

445
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,140
He has been resting at home these days.

446
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:19,400
Next time you tell a lie,

447
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,700
get your buddies on the same page.

448
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,540
[Mr. Wu]

449
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,340
[Mr. Wu]

450
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:48,170
What?

451
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,000
Take it, put on the speaker.

452
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:08,800
[Mr. Wu]

453
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,340
Shuheng,

454
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,300
your valuable lighter was left here

455
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,740
at the meeting.

456
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,100
If you're not in a hurry,

457
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:16,970
I'll give it to you next time we meet.

458
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,100
Okay, Mr. Wu.

459
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:21,970
Just give it to me next time we meet.

460
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,200
Bye.

461
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,100
Is that okay?

462
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,200
I've followed your orders.

463
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:35,970
I didn't have time to prepare a testimony.

464
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,440
You can trust me now.

465
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,940
Sorry, I was suspicious.

466
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,640
Honey, why are you suspicious today?

467
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,840
My agent has told you my schedule.

468
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,370
I have no secrets before you.

469
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,440
What do you really want?

470
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,040
Am I a man full of lies

471
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,440
in your mind?

472
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,740
Sorry.

473
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:04,770
Sorry,

474
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,040
it's my fault.

475
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:13,600
Maybe I've been immersed in my script.

476
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,740
You,

477
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:15,740
just forgive me, okay?

478
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,100
It depends on you.

479
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:24,200
I've just invested
in a program worth 550 million yuan.

480
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,940
This little program of yours is
out of questions.

481
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,240
Okay, it's a piece of cake.

482
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,400
Bye.

483
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,840
You've finally finished your call, Mr. Wu.

484
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,940
This is Mr. Wu.

485
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:33,400
Mr. Wu,

486
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,240
this is Cindy, our company's actress.

487
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,570
Mr. Wu, I've heard so much about you.

488
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:37,200
Hello, Cindy.

489
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,300
Let's add friends on WeChat.

490
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,200
Sure, on WeChat.

491
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:39,940
Sit and add friends.

492
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:40,940
I'll scan your code.

493
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:41,640
Okay.

494
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,570
Ganggang, polish the glasses again.

495
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:46,040
Thank you.

496
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:48,470
Honey, what's your progress?

497
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:50,800
Come, look at the camera.

498
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,800
A video?

499
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,900
The yearly best couple.

500
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,540
Miss, can I go back home first?

501
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:03,000
My husband called me home
in a hurry.

502
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:04,640
Of course not.

503
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,040
We've agreed

504
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:07,170
that you'll drive everybody home.

505
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,340
The assistant work needs you
to be on call all the time.

506
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,640
Just let your husband give you
more understanding.

507
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:13,840
Okay.

508
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,800
It's all right, Ganggang.

509
00:28:15,970 --> 00:28:16,640
Just get back.

510
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,800
People here are all familiar.
We don't know when this will be over.

511
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:21,370
Just be casual.

512
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:23,040
Okay.

513
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,300
As Su Li, the great scriptwriter,
has given orders,

514
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:27,340
I'll let you go.

515
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,100
Say thank you to Ms. Su.

516
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,700
Thank you, Ms. Su.

517
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,800
You're welcome, just go.

518
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,570
Thank you. I'll go first.

519
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,640
Ms. Su, I need to go back for a while.

520
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,240
If it's too late, I won't come for dinner.

521
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:53,800
Is there anything wrong?

522
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,740
The property phoned, telling me
that there may be a leak in my house.

523
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,700
I have to get back.

524
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,370
Is it serious?

525
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:58,700
It sounds serious.

526
00:28:59,200 --> 00:28:59,700
Wait a second.

527
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,370
Shuheng, stop your work.

528
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:02,100
Listen to me.

529
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:03,500
What's wrong?

530
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:06,700
There's a leak in Yingying's house.

531
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,700
You can accompany her home.

532
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:08,770
She's not safe just being herself alone.

533
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:11,100
Are you okay with your own?

534
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,770
There's little work left, I can do it.

535
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:14,100
Just hurry back.

536
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:15,300
We'll wait for you.

537
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,300
- Okay.
- We'll go there first.

538
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:16,580
Okay.

539
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:18,500
Let's go. I'll take my clothes.

540
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:37,840
Thank you.

541
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:37,980
[Size 38]

542
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:39,640
Mr. Wu,

543
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,500
if it were not for you this time,

544
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,400
I would have been

545
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,570
in danger.

546
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:45,000
It's a piece of cake.

547
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:46,640
We men need

548
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,600
to help each other,

549
00:30:48,170 --> 00:30:49,700
so as to defend the tigress at home.

550
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,000
No problem.

551
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,770
I'll toast you two.

552
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,300
For what?

553
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,300
Seeing you beloved couple

554
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,700
let me

555
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,140
trust love again.

556
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,440
Then I'll congratulate Mr. Wu

557
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,600
for recovering so fast.

558
00:31:20,570 --> 00:31:21,240
Thank you.

559
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,370
The squid is tender and smooth,

560
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:41,800
so delicious.

561
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,000
Eat more if you find it delicious.
