00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,660
and then let me become a better me?

194
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,130
In that case, you're so amazing.

195
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:19,660
Should I say thank you?

196
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:22,060
But there's one thing

197
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:23,260
I really need to thank you.

198
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,160
You help me eliminate

199
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,960
the two biggest bugs in my life.

200
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:28,930
You

201
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,730
and Chen Yingying.

202
00:15:32,330 --> 00:15:33,730
One betrayed my love.

203
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,860
One stained my friendship.

204
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:38,700
Even if Chen Yingying and I wronged you,

205
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,600
what about you?

206
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:42,900
You also keep calculating us,

207
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,160
revenging us in the dark.

208
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,530
Working hard to set me up

209
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,060
to steal the fake jewels,

210
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,400
just to give me false hope?

211
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:49,730
Right?

212
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,060
No, you said "working hard".

213
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:01,160
How could I just want to give you
false hope?

214
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:03,960
What fake jewels?

215
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:05,900
What you stole

216
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:08,160
are actually real jewels
with a worth of four million yuan.

217
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,900
I have a receipt for each of them.

218
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,930
And I'm going to call the police.

219
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:16,960
They're fake!

220
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,330
I've already identified them.

221
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:19,760
Even if you report me,

222
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,360
I'm totally fine with that.

223
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:25,860
The police will only find out

224
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,660
that you stole your wife's jewels
for your mistress.

225
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,160
The entertainment journalists don't care

226
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,760
whether the jewels are real or not.

227
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,060
They only care about your scandal.

228
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,130
From now on,

229
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,930
Zhang Shuheng will only be tagged

230
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:40,660
with cheating and stealing!

231
00:16:41,330 --> 00:16:42,730
Is that still fine with you?

232
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,730
You're crazy.

233
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,460
Making things worse,

234
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:49,400
aren't you afraid of paying for it?

235
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,700
You better think

236
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,060
of yourself first.

237
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,200
You have three days.

238
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,330
I want my real jewels back

239
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:02,600
in three days.

240
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Let me help you.

241
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:57,660
Let me help.

242
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,130
Thank you.

243
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,400
You're welcome.

244
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,330
We're neighbors.

245
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:10,530
I live in 403.

246
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:11,200
My surname's Zhao.

247
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,260
Just call me Zhao.

248
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:13,700
Thanks a lot, Zhao.

249
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,460
It's okay.

250
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,960
Give it to me. I'll take it.

251
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,660
It's fine. It's so heavy.

252
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,530
I'll take it to your home.

253
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,400
Which way?

254
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,330
This way.

255
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:24,500
Where should I put it?

256
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,860
Here, just here.

257
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:31,730
Thanks so much.

258
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,200
It doesn't matter.

259
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:34,860
Would you like some water?

260
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:35,930
Drink before you leave.

261
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:36,530
Thank you.

262
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,260
For such heavy things,

263
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,730
calling your husband
to take them next time.

264
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,800
Men should take care
of all the tough work.

265
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:45,730
I got to go.

266
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:46,700
Thank you.

267
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,060
- It's fine, hold your step.
- Bye.

268
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:48,600
Bye.

269
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,200
These are all
the valuable things I have.

270
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:00,360
Still one million left.

271
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:18,530
Only these?

272
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:21,060
I don't have more.

273
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:23,400
Counting my stuff on,

274
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,560
still over one million left,

275
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:26,960
how

276
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,000
about letting my stuff go...

277
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:32,660
Forget it.

278
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,360
Let's find another way.

279
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,360
I'm back.

280
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,260
Welcome back!

281
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:49,500
Why are all the packages here?

282
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,530
Why don't you put them away?

283
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,930
I just carry them back.

284
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:54,100
I'm still too busy on it.

285
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,260
Don't put things around next time.

286
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:07,800
Who's been here?

287
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:10,820
The neighbor upstairs
helped me carry things,

288
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:12,100
so I gave him a cup of water.

289
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,760
I told you before,

290
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:17,060
don't let any strangers in.

291
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:19,460
He's not a stranger.

292
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:20,600
He lives in 403.

293
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,260
Ganggang,

294
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:24,660
remember,

295
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,700
you're married now.

296
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:29,440
You need to keep distance
with other men.

297
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:30,240
Got it?

298
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,120
Here.

299
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,350
You brought me a gift!

300
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:41,020
Wash those clothes.

301
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:42,820
That needs hand washing.

302
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:58,480
Ms. Su,

303
00:20:59,080 --> 00:20:59,920
the contract's effective now.

304
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,780
This overseas house is legally yours.

305
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:02,620
Thank you.

306
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,980
(It's all coming to an end.)

307
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:12,320
(I'm eventually saying goodbye
to this failed marriage.)

308
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:14,550
(I used to think)

309
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,380
(ending this relationship)

310
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:19,080
(will make me upset for a while.)

311
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:21,380
(But actually not.)

312
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:23,880
(Maybe it's because the end)

313
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:27,780
(of one relationship is not an end)

314
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,680
(to happiness,)

315
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,350
(but on the contrary,)

316
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,550
(a mercy given by god,)

317
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,350
(who thinks he doesn't deserve it.)

318
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:36,820
(So)

319
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,620
(god lets you get out of it.)

320
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,620
Honey.

321
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,920
(There's a blue file on my desk.)

322
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,680
(Find it out and deliver to me.)

323
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:06,550
Now?

324
00:22:07,150 --> 00:22:08,220
(Yes, I need it now.)

325
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:09,820
(I'll send you an address.)

326
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:10,420
(Bring it to me now.)

327
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,180
Okay.

328
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,880
Ganggang, you really came.

329
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,420
I'm here to deliver the file.

330
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:27,620
Shen's inside.

331
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:28,620
Just get in.

332
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,120
What did I say?

333
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,520
What did I say before?

334
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:58,880
What?

335
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,980
You don't need your file now?

336
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,980
Who lost the bet?

337
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:04,980
Drink!

338
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,100
Drink what?

339
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,320
What happened indeed?

340
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,420
Ganggang,

341
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:10,920
Shen's taking a Truth or Dare just now.

342
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,080
If you delivered the file
in this midnight,

343
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:13,880
he won!

344
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:14,920
Ganggang,

345
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,520
you're too obedient to him.

346
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,280
You're totally nailed by Shen.

347
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,680
What did you say!

348
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,680
Let me introduce to you.

349
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,080
Mr. Liu, my partner.

350
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:22,520
Nice to meet you.

351
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,100
My wife.

352
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:23,620
Nice to meet you, too.

353
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,280
You guys go ahead.

354
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:28,980
I'll take a look outside.

355
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,120
Ganggang.

356
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,680
it's just a joke.

357
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,950
Why are you so angry?

358
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,620
I called a taxi to bring the file to you
in the midnight!

359
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,950
I thought it really matters to you.

360
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:43,280
You said it's just a joke?

361
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,420
I had to!

362
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,320
You saw it!

363
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,580
They are all clients and colleagues!

364
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,780
I just came back from a business trip

365
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,980
and had meetings all day long.

366
00:23:52,550 --> 00:23:54,350
I even had no time to call you.

367
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,220
Now I'm dying tired.

368
00:23:57,220 --> 00:23:59,180
All I want is coming home
to take a rest.

369
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:02,480
But the client insisted on coming out
for games to relax.

370
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,750
Can I say no to that?

371
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:06,680
Honey.

372
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,980
I'm working so hard outside.

373
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,320
It's fine that you can't help,

374
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:16,750
but you can't ask me
to comfort you instead.

375
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,350
Honey.

376
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:27,020
I don't ask for you
to be the icing on the cake.

377
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,750
But please don't become the frost
on snow.

378
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:31,480
Okay?

379
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,780
I know it's tough for you.

380
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,780
I just misunderstood you.

381
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:43,680
Okay.

382
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:46,350
Now

383
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,920
I need to go back to deal with them.

384
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,080
You go home first.

385
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,120
Alright?

386
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,280
Shen,

387
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,480
is your wife angry?

388
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:16,220
What are you looking at?

389
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,920
Nothing at all.

390
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:22,150
Let's drink!

391
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,320
Next time we'll get a big one!

392
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,280
Okay, no problem.

393
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,220
Mr. Yang,

394
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,220
I'll be right there.

395
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:37,620
The materials?

396
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,180
They're at home.

397
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:40,820
Okay, I'll go back to take it.

398
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,200
I'm sorry.

399
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:47,960
Zhao.

400
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,800
What a coincidence.

401
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:51,860
Zhao, how much is it? I'll pay for it.

402
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:52,900
No need.

403
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:53,530
See, still good.

404
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:54,260
It's fine.

405
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:54,960
No need.

What's up?

407
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,400
I've bumped Zhao's food off.

408
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,500
I want to pay for it,

409
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,900
but he said there's no need.

410
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:05,700

412
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,560
It's not a big deal.

413
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,200
No need to pay.

414
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:09,900
Why not?

415
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,130
It's just barbecue. We can afford it.

416
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:13,660
Right?

417
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:15,360
Otherwise, reckoning makes long friends,

418
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,360
not to mention neighbors.

420
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:19,730
Sorry for that.

421
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:22,100
I'm sorry.

422
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,460
Why did you say that to Zhao?

423
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:30,730
We'll meet in the future.

424
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:31,530
It's so embarrassing.

425
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:32,560
What?

426
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:33,700
Feel sorry?

427
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:35,930
You repeatedly called him Zhao

428
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:36,930
in an intimate manner.

429
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:38,560
No.

430
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:39,700
We're neighbors,

431
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,660
isn't it normal to be polite?

432
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,330
But when you two talk,

433
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:44,560
you look so close.

434
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:46,260
It doesn't look like
you are just neighbors.

435
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,660
You were never so enthusiastic to me!

436
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,260
Unreasonable.

437
00:26:51,730 --> 00:26:54,130
I don't even know his name!

438
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:55,530
I don't know what you're talking about.

439
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:57,700
Wang Ganggang!

440
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:01,130
You never fought with me!

441
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:02,260
Now you do it to me

442
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,300
for a random guy?

443
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,460
You've changed.

444
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:08,460
Now I see.

445
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:11,200
Communicating with someone
in different channels

446
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,860
is useless even if forgiving him
for a thousand times.

447
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,330
The one who doesn't know you

448
00:27:15,730 --> 00:27:17,130
will never accept your words.

449

The one who knows you,

00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:18,900
don't even need a word.

451
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:22,330
Don't think that I don't know.

[Character Profile for Ambiguous]
After reading this character profile,

456
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,130
I think it's like a group portrait play,

457
00:27:39,130 --> 00:27:41,330
so the character
of the hero is quite strong.

458
00:27:43,330 --> 00:27:43,960
That's right.

459
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,560

How do you feel?

00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:01,160
I feel a little sick.
