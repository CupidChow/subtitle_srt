You're welcome.

Alone in the hospital,

29
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,290
is he alright?

30
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,960
He may be discharged soon.

31
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:41,560
After all, he got hurt because of me.

32
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,420

where's the patient in this room?

38
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,320
He left this afternoon.

I'm going.

00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,160
I'll get ready for tomorrow's departure.

41
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,160
Once you get the money,

42
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,220
come to see me at the hotel immediately.

43
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:34,860
Okay.

44
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,060

00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,520

Didn't you leave

59
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,260
after being discharged
from the hospital yesterday?

60
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:19,820
I'm here for work.

61
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:24,820
You went to the hospital yesterday?

62
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,060
So you didn't sleep well last night?

63
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,690
You were upset

64
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,720
because you thought I had left,
weren't you?

65
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,720
I've made it very clear to you.

66
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,090
You're fired.

67
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:36,820
Ms. Su,

68
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,020
according to the National Labor Law,

69
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,260
the company can't dismiss an employee

70
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,060
during his medical treatment period.

71
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,160
Even the period expired,

72
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,460
a written dismissal notice

73
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,420
should be given to the employee 30 days
in advance.

74
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:47,090
So

75
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,360
I'm still your employee.

76
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,660
I'll have HR send you

77
00:05:58,660 --> 00:05:59,660
a written notice now.

78
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,960
Then I'll have at least 30 days

79
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,820
to be around you.

80
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,160
Why can't you understand?

81
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,320
What can you do in 30 days?

82
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,290
At least I can let you know the real me.

83
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,490
I want to pursue you again,

84
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,320
without any other purposes.

85
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,090
Whatever.

86
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,660
Ms. Su,

87
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,860
I have something to report to you.

88
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,290
The project Don't We All Love Dresses

89
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:50,060

90
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:51,860
I've always felt sorry for it.

91
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:52,890
So during this time,

92
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:54,660
I've been trying to push it forward.

93
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,020
The other day,

94
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:58,020
I met Lu Zifan's agent.

95
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:58,820
I learned

96
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,220
that Lu happens to be available.

97
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:02,290
And Lu's willing to take on this project.

98
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:03,820
That's great!

99
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,960
Lu Zifan's a great choice.

100
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,420
He has both strong acting skills
and influence.

101
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,060
Ganggang, you helped a lot this time.

102
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:11,260
This's what I should do.

103
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,720
I also think this's a good opportunity,

104
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,090
so I discussed the contract with them.

105
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,520
After all, he's an A-list actor.

106
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:20,060
We need to show our sincerity.

107
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,260
Su Li,

108
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,520
will you blame me for making decisions?

109
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,460
Of course not.

110
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:30,060
The contract went well.

111
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,260
But

112
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,720
they asked for one million deposit

113
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,290
to sign the letter of intent.

114
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:35,860
And

115
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,690
they stressed the need for cash

116
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:39,020
as soon as possible,

117
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:40,490
preferably tomorrow.

118
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,760
Why cash?

119
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,020
And why in such a hurry?

120
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,160
Maybe they have cash-flow problems.

121
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:54,020
We may not have

122
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,820
one million in cash.

123
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,420
Okay.

124
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,090
I'll figure it out.

125
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:12,120
Go to the finance department
to get the seal and apply.

126
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:13,620
Okay.

127
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,220
But it's not too much trouble.

128
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,460
This's the payment document.

129
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,290
Just sign your name on it.

130
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:26,860
You're quite thoughtful.

131
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,060
I...

132
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,160
If other employees of our company

133
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,220
are all as careful as you,

134
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,160
I can be so relieved.

135
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:48,860
Okay.

136
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:52,460
Then I'll go out first.

137
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:00,890
Su Li,

138
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,520
are you free tonight?

139
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,060
I want to invite you to dinner.

140
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,060
Okay.

141
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,320
But it's on me.

142
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,960
You don't need to treat me dinner.

143
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,360
You've treated me for so many times,

144
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,290
so I'll treat you this time.

145
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:14,560

146
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,960
I want an Australian Wagyu Tongue Slice,

147
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,490
a Waldorf Salad,

148
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,320
a Salmon and Avocado Salad.

149
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,490
I want

150
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:29,760
an Australian Angus M3+

151
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,320

153
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:34,560
Okay.

154
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:34,960
It's enough.

155
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,920
We can't eat so much.

156
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:39,160
Okay, that's it.

157
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:39,620
We can order later.

158
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:39,890
Okay.

159
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:40,290
Thank you.

160
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:46,160
Have you been starving yourself
since yesterday?

161
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,320
Please enjoy.

162
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:50,960
Thanks.

163
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,760
Are you feeding pigs?

164
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,220
You even wanted to order more?

165
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,920
We can't eat all this.

166
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:03,120
It's the last time.

167
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,360
I want to treat you to something good.

168
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,560
The last time?

169
00:10:11,090 --> 00:10:12,320
Yes.

170
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,290
You don't expect a salaried person

171
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:17,360
to treat you all the time, do you?

172
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,360
Well,

173
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,020
Ms. Wang ganggang.

174
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,260
Invite me to a dinner

175
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,220
and still haggle over every detail.

176
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,420
You penny-pincher.

177
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,690
Fine.

178
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:29,960
I need to be quick.

179
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,360
There's a meeting later.

180
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,720
Take your time.

181
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,490
You could have indigestion.

182
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,490
You shouldn't always

183
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:43,490
be so focused on your work.

184
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:46,060
Often forgot to eat.

185
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:48,260
Needed me to remind you.

186
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:50,620
That's because I have a good assistant.

187
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:55,690
If

188
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,460
I'm not around you anymore,

189
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,820
you must take care of yourself.

190
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,690
Health comes first,

191
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:07,490
work comes second.

192
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:09,690
Not around me?

193
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:10,320
Where're you going?

194
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,620
I mean in case

195
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,290
I'm not around you.

196
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,160
Every time you write the script,

197
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,320
you sit for a whole afternoon

198
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,520
without moving your ass.

199
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,920
You can't be like this all the time.

200
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,720
The doctor said you had
lumbar muscle strain.

201
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,890
Every hour,

202
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:35,690
you should get up to stretch and walk.

203
00:11:36,890 --> 00:11:37,690
And

204
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,690
you should also go to your yoga class
more often,

205
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,320
take more exercise, and drink more water.

206
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,690
Why are you so weird today?

207
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,720
It's like we'll never see each other
again.

208
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:00,820
I'm not.

209
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:02,490
I...

210
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:06,290
I watched a medical lecture yesterday.

211
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:08,760
The doctor said a lot about this.

212
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,760
Okay.

213
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,290
Aunt Wang,

214
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:17,090
a young lady acting like my mom.

215
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:18,890
Let's eat.

216
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:21,660
Okay.

217
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:22,060
Eat.

218
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:16,090
What's this?

219
00:13:16,090 --> 00:13:17,720
Freshly baked palmier

220
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,260
and other desserts.

221
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,220
You're a delivery boy now?

222
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,660
How did you know?

223
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:24,260
I...

224
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:25,320
I was going to order delivery,

225
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,090
but I accidentally registered
as a delivery man.

226
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:29,720
However, I only deliver for you.

227
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:31,920
Keep it.

228
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,060
You don't like this?

229
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:36,920
If you don't like it,

230
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,420
I'll buy something else.

231
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,960
Can you be quiet?

232
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,520
I'm really in a bad mood.

233
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:42,520
And

234
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,360
why did you leave the office

235
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,260
to come here?

236
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:45,160
Aren't you afraid...

237
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:45,760
Afraid of what?

238
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,120
Afraid of you

239
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:48,620
firing me?

240
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,490
I've already been fired by you.

241
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:52,560
Besides,

242
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,760
you didn't give me anything to do.

243
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,220
So I arranged it myself.

244
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,660
What's this?

245
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,760
You just said I didn't give you anything
to do.

246
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,720
I'm ordering you now,

247
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,820
to take the money
to the accounting office.

248
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:11,520
Hey, wait.

249
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:12,320
Where're you going?

250
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:27,760
Ms. Zhao,

251
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,320
I'm here...

252
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,420
The deposit for the actor
of Don't We All Love Dresses, right?

253
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:31,920
Yes.

254
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:34,860
Sign it first.

255
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,320
Ms. Su has told me,

256
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,360
one million in cash.

257
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,300
Ms. Su's very nice to you.

258
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:52,360
The company's available working capital
weren't enough,

259
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,800
so she took money

260
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,600
from her personal account,

261
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,060
and had someone to take it to here.

262
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:57,960
She told us

263
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,330
to give you the money when you come.

264
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,620
[Zhao of accounting office]

265
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,100
Ms. Su,

266
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:14,560
Wang Ganggang has taken the money away.

267
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:16,760
Okay, I see.

268
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,580
[Wang Weide]

269
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,100
How did you know I was here?

270
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:26,660
I couldn't get through you,

271
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:28,460
so I came here to try my luck.

272
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,700
I read an interview of you before.

273
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,800
You said,

274
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:31,760
when you were in a bad mood,

275
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,760
you liked to come to this restaurant.

276
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:38,860
Do you know

277
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:41,900
most sharks are not social animals.

278
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:45,000
See,

279
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,660
they don't seem to communicate
with each other.

280
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:48,360
Do you think

281
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:51,060
they are lonely?

282
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:56,760
No fish dare to approach sharks

283
00:16:57,930 --> 00:16:59,260
because of their ferocious nature.

284
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,260
What about people?

285
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,300
Do you think the more powerful you are,

286
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,700
the fewer friends you'll have

287
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:11,730
and you are doomed to be lonely?

288
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:16,760
Of course not.

289
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:19,800
Have you

290
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,700
seen the starry sky?

291
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:25,060
You'll always find a star to be brightest
in the night sky.

292
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:27,500
It seems to have nothing around it.

293
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,200
Actually,

294
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,960
if you look carefully, you'll find

295
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,700
there's something around it.

296
00:17:34,130 --> 00:17:35,700
It's just

297
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,500
because the star is so bright

298
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:39,500
that the faint light around it
is easily overlooked.

299
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:43,200
If a person feels lonely,

300
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,160
is it because

301
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,760
she ignored the small beings
around her?

302
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,200
Although I don't know what bothers you,

303
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,330
I want to be the one who banishes
your troubles.

304
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,800
Could you give me a chance?

305
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,360
Where're you taking me to?

306
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,130
To a place

307
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,700
where no one can find you.

308
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:08,930
I never thought

309
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:10,600
we could see such beautiful stars

310
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,100
in a place so close to the city.

311
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:13,860
Yeah.

312
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:15,200
Unfortunately,

313
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,100
you can never see the Milky Way
in the city.

314
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,730
I remember when I was a child,
I can see the Milky Way

315
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:21,330
all over the sky in summer.

316
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:25,100
How nice it was.

317
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:27,400
The star in the center is very bright,

318
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,400
but the stars around have their own light.

319
00:19:59,100 --> 00:19:59,460
Here.

320
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:01,860
You brought this?

321
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:14,530
All the troubles can go away

322
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,400
like the firework.

323
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,160
We are all scriptwriters of our own lives.

324
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,360
Why not write yourself a happy ending?

325
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,560
You made it sound so easy.

326
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,260
We are all creators.

327
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,560
Have some romance.

328
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,000
Head to the Milky Way.

329
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,900
Soar into the universe.

330
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:31,100
I'll take this for you.

331
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:31,500
Thank you.

332
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,300
Thank you

333
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,730
for staying with me today

334
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,620
and showing me the most beautiful stars

335
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,220
I've seen in years.

336
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,200
I should thank you

337
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,600
for giving me

338
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,900
an opportunity to swoop in

339
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,330
to keep me by your side for so long.

340
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:54,930
I know

341
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:56,800
perhaps there's

342
00:21:58,760 --> 00:21:59,900
no chance for me to be with you.

343
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,060
But having such a wonderful night,

344
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,330
I'm really happy.

345
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,460
Good night.

346
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,160
Good night.

347
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:19,760
Rest early.

348
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,300
It's about the time.

349
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:51,930
Shall we go now?

350
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:52,400
Okay.

351
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:52,700
Let's go.

352
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,020
You go ahead.

353
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,130
I have to go to the restroom.

354
00:22:58,130 --> 00:22:59,200
I'll follow.

355
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,100
I'll wait for you, Honey.

356
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,000
(Ren, you go first.)

357
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,160
(Don't wait for me.)

358
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:41,660
Look.

359
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,730
See how pretty you are.

360
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,460
You deserve
of even the most precious gifts.

361
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,820
I hope you stay true to yourself.

362
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:54,150
Whatever decision you make,

363
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:57,150
I'll support you.

364
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,120
You're so dumb.

365
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,320
You're just

366
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:02,980
too nice,

367
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:03,750
too sweet,

368
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:04,980
and too kind.

369
00:24:06,550 --> 00:24:08,350
Ms. Su's so nice to you.

370
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:11,350
(The company's available working capital
weren't enough,)

371
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:14,720
(so she took money
from her personal account.)

372
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,580
(She told us)

373
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,520
(to give you the money when you come.)

374
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,480
(I really like
what the navigation app says.)

375
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,520
(You've deviated from the route,)

376
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:24,680
(we've replanned the route for you.)

377
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,550
(Please make a U-turn
at a proper location.)

378
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,120
All right.

379
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,620
Go and wash up.

380
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:26,520
Your face's dirty from crying,

381
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,380
like a kitty nobody wants.

382
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,180
Alright.

383
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,880
If nobody wants you, I'll keep you.

384
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:41,920
Su Li,

385
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,420
I'm sorry.

386
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:45,780
You're so nice to me,

387
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,880
but I lied to you.

388
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:55,320
I was willing to be cheated by you.

389
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,180
Your acting and excuses were so poor.

390
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,320
Who would believe you?

391
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,620
When did you find out?

392
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,180
I've known since you asked me

393
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,880
for money.

394
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,920
A deposit of one million

395
00:26:08,920 --> 00:26:10,150
in cash.

396
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:11,780
How's that possible?

397
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,280
Even if I'm willing to give them,

398
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,620
they wouldn't accept.

399
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,620
If you've known it,

400
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,420
why did you give me the money?

401
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,550
Because I wanted you to lead a happy life.

402
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,880
I don't know what you think of me now,

403
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,120
but

404
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:36,820
I've

405
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:38,480
always

406
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,180
treated you as my real sister
from beginning to end.

407
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,120
Because only you

408
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:45,780
have always been by my side

409
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,220
when I was

410
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,380
the most down and out

411
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,380
and most helpless.

412
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:54,780
Without you,

413
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,320
I don't even know if I can get through it.

414
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:01,580
What's more,

415
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,480
I also know that you received kickbacks

416
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:06,420
from projects.

417
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,220
I'm sorry, Su Li.

418
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:15,950
In fact, after you reconciled
with Shen Charen,

419
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,080
I saw you getting

420
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,550
happier day by day.

421
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:26,100
I started to doubt if I was wrong,

422
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:26,740
and Shen Charen

423
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:27,920
had really changed.

424
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,420
Since then,

425
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:32,180
I made up my mind.

426
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:33,480
I'll give you

427
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,420
the money.

428
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:36,480
If Shen Charen

429
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,120
is wholeheartedly willing
to be with you forever,

430
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,140
I can let go of

431
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:43,140
what happened before.

432
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,080
I'll take the money

433
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,280
as your marriage fund.

434
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,480
I'm sorry, Su Li.

435
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,040
I'm so sorry.

436
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,980
Why are you saying sorry to me?

437
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,480
But except sorry,

438
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,440
I don't know what else I can say.

439
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:06,680
Then don't say anything.

440
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,380
I'm not angry with you.

441
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:12,180
Have you ever seen an elder sister

442
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,680
getting angry with her little sister?

443
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,700
I'll see you as a teenager

444
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,180

445
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,740
and crazy for love.

446
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:19,300
Okay?

447
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,460
Sorry, Su Li.

448
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:22,740
I'm sorry.

449
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:24,540
Oh my gosh.

450
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:27,460
My sister's not only rebellious
at such an age

451
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:28,580
but also dumb.

452
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,980
She can't even speak.

453
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:33,380
