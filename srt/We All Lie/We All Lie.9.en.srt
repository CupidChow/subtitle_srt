00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,660
please save my child.

It's okay.

I'm fine.

if everything's going well inside.

Glad they're safe.

You'd better keep your promise.

It's for the best of everyone.

241
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:02,680

What's your plan for Su Li's child?

247
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,080
It's so urgent.

You still have the mood
to read this lousy script?

If you are as capable as Su Li,

251
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,120
why don't you get me a good script?

00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:36,960

you just decided
to keep this baby yesterday,

268
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:26,760
but today, you've already decided

269
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,520
which school he'll go to

270
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,590
after his birth.

271
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,420
Since I've decided to keep him,

272
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,760
I must give him the best.

Can't you find them yourself?

I'm totally disappointed with you,

I don't want to know at all, either.

Su Li,

345
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,420
you're so perfect,

00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,360
what could Zhang Shuheng
be dissatisfied with

347
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,590
and resort to cheating?

348
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,460
If a man wants to cheat,

349
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:20,860
it doesn't matter whether
you're perfect or not.

350
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,420
Moreover,

351
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,860
even if you're a goddess,

352
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,620
he'll still have his eye on other women.

353
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,060
You don't understand?

354
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:32,460
Well, how to capture a man's heart?

355
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,960
My mom has told me the way

356
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,190
to a man's heart is

357
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:36,520
through his stomach,

358
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,960
so I've been trying my best
to learn to cook.

359
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,920
Have you seen a man

360
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:42,720
has a ministry

361
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,460
because she cooks well?

362
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:46,860
You're so dumb.

363
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,060
You're just

364
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:48,760
too nice,

365
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,520
too sweet

366
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:50,760
and too kind,

367
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:52,520
so

368
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,220
he doesn't listen

369
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,560
mostly because he's spoiled.

370
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,360
So you have

371
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,020
to scold him.

372
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:00,660

373
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,390
Scold!

374
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:06,520
Shen Charen,

375
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:08,160
you are a jerk.

376
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,260
I curse you,

377
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:11,820
curse you

378
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,420
that all the meat you take

379

gingers.

381
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,720
It's not vicious enough.
