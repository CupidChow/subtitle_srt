Ten million yuan?

193
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,290
What's up?

194
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,490
Even such a nobody is paid much more

195
00:11:42,490 --> 00:11:43,560
than me.

196
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,560
He's also arrogant.

197
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,360
It's only a matter of time
for his downfall to come.

198
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,060
Why are you here?

199
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,320
I've bought the jewels.

200
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,660
Have you really thought this through?

201
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:07,560
All that hard-earned cash going back

202
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,890
to Su Li?

203
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,420
We're totally under her thumb.

204
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,490
What if you end up

205
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:14,660
with nothing in the divorce?

206
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,220
Who said I'm giving it back?

207
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,220
I've figured out how to deal with her.

208
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,860
When I moved my things out the other day,

209
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:32,860
I accidentally found a script

210
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,620
Su Li spent years writing.

211
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:36,920
She has sold it to a film company.

212
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,090
If Su Li doesn't agree
with an equal division of property

213
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:41,920
and divorce amicably,

214
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:44,620
I'll leak it.

215
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,290
This way,

216
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,660
not only does she waste years
of hard work,

217
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,690
she'll also face a hefty lawsuit.

218
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,320
Turnout is a fair play.

219
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,520
Let her have a taste of being blackmailed
like us.

220
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:01,760
Smart move.

221
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:03,960
Alright,

222
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,290
I'm going back for filming.

223
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:06,520
I'll be home.

224
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:06,960

and can't throw away.)

Rubbed someone the wrong way?

261
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,900
Or did you blabber

262
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,000
and slip it up?

263
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,760
No way, Boss.

264
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,860
How could I let it slip?

265

see if we can minimize the damage.

269
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,660
Then tell them

270
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:39,330
we'll let Wang Hao play the role
with a discount for friends.

271
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:41,960

272
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,260

Don't go out.

276

Keep a low profile.

Lu,

281
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,100
why are you heated?

282
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,130
It's because of the scandal, right?

283
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,730
It's good to you.

284
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,930

that there're too many lines

290

Su Li,

295
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,530
yesterday, I overheard Zhang Shuheng
and Chen Yingying

296
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:21,530
in the car.

297
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,660
They planned to take revenge.

298
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:23,960

299
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:25,860
he stole the script you've been working on
for years.

300
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
And he wants to leak it.

301
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,360

00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,600
They meant for me to hear,

313
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,260
so I would steal the USB drive.

Don't worry.

our marriage

00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,750
was just a trivial illusion

00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,480
