=The Rise of Ning=

00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,320
(Adapted from Wen Tan's novel "Chancellor
Training Handbook" from Jinjiang Literature)

3
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,509
=Episode 28=

4
00:01:39,456 --> 00:01:41,680
(Gu Minglan: "May we be united
by virtue, hand in hand.)

5
00:01:41,752 --> 00:01:43,913
Your uncle has the nerve
to write it down.

6
00:01:44,161 --> 00:01:45,960
But he dared to send it out.

7
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:47,600
I eventually found this letter.

8
00:01:48,383 --> 00:01:49,478
Nonsense!

9
00:01:49,633 --> 00:01:51,200
Uncle may have written it.

10
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,944
But what does it have
to do with my mother?

11
00:01:53,138 --> 00:01:54,658
My mother never did anything wrong.

12
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,519
You're being unreasonable.

13
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,830
How am I unreasonable?

14
00:01:57,911 --> 00:01:59,310
If your mother didn't seduce him,

15
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:00,306
would your uncle

16
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:03,142
be bold enough to have feelings
toward his sister-in-law?

17
00:02:03,152 --> 00:02:05,280
Does the Luo family no longer care
about its reputation?

18
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,360
Keep your mouth shut!

19
00:02:08,247 --> 00:02:09,127
Chengwen,

20
00:02:09,815 --> 00:02:11,200
what else do you have to say?

21
00:02:15,693 --> 00:02:17,400
I swear in my name

22
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:20,040
that nothing happened
between Minglan and I.

23
00:02:20,679 --> 00:02:21,479
Chengzhang,

24
00:02:21,686 --> 00:02:23,280
the three of us grew up together.

25
00:02:23,822 --> 00:02:24,622
I...

26
00:02:30,927 --> 00:02:32,566
I admit I have feelings for Minglan.

27
00:02:32,713 --> 00:02:35,440
But Minglan didn't know that.

28
00:02:35,888 --> 00:02:37,767
When Mother betrothed Minglan to you,

29
00:02:37,848 --> 00:02:39,298
I had already given up on that thought.

30
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:40,179
But...

31
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,728
But later, you mistreated her
because of your mistress.

32
00:02:42,809 --> 00:02:43,920
I wrote this letter

33
00:02:44,399 --> 00:02:45,960
out of anger.

34
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,080
You've finally confessed

35
00:02:49,161 --> 00:02:50,041
what's in your heart.

36
00:02:50,341 --> 00:02:51,141
That's enough!

37
00:02:55,461 --> 00:02:56,600
You two

38
00:02:57,734 --> 00:02:58,814
have treated me like a fool

39
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,480
all these years.

40
00:03:00,655 --> 00:03:01,655
Chengzhang,

41
00:03:02,679 --> 00:03:04,520
Minglan was definitely not
that kind of person.

42
00:03:04,783 --> 00:03:05,623
After all these years,

43
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,189
do you still not trust her?

44
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,624
If that's the case, her whole life

45
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:10,520
has been a mistake.

46
00:03:10,601 --> 00:03:11,401
Shut up.

47
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:14,920
Luo Chengwen,

48
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,384
what right do you have

49
00:03:16,465 --> 00:03:17,520
to speak to me like this?

50
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,880
You don't deserve to be my brother!

51
00:03:41,267 --> 00:03:43,320
- Father.
- Who is your father?

52
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,150
I'm not your father!

53
00:03:59,262 --> 00:04:00,062
My dear.

54
00:04:11,647 --> 00:04:12,840
I didn't expect

55
00:04:13,223 --> 00:04:14,703
that so much would happen at home

56
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,960
while I was away on the mountain.

57
00:04:17,871 --> 00:04:19,960
Has the one been sent
to pick up Ms. Zheng left yet?

58
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,519
Yes.

59
00:04:21,853 --> 00:04:22,653
Good.

60
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:24,205
After picking up Ms. Zheng,

61
00:04:24,286 --> 00:04:25,606
make sure to keep it quiet.

62
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:28,278
Bring her to my room.

63
00:04:28,359 --> 00:04:29,719
I have something to ask her.

64
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:30,639
All right.

65
00:04:31,862 --> 00:04:32,662
Grandma,

66
00:04:32,893 --> 00:04:34,973
how's your health?

67
00:04:36,749 --> 00:04:37,708
I'm good.

68
00:04:38,162 --> 00:04:39,840
Didn't you give me

69
00:04:40,254 --> 00:04:41,640
that pill?

70
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,719
It's very effective.

71
00:04:44,054 --> 00:04:45,095
Forgive me for doing this.

72
00:04:45,622 --> 00:04:47,080
I wouldn't have done this

73
00:04:47,455 --> 00:04:49,054
if the situation hadn't pushed me.

74
00:04:49,143 --> 00:04:49,943
No,

75
00:04:50,831 --> 00:04:52,792
you did well.

76
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:55,840
Even if you don't tell me now,

77
00:04:56,831 --> 00:04:58,951
I'll find out in a few days.

78
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,039
Don't worry.

79
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,360
For Yining,

80
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,640
I must hold on

81
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,480
as her grandmother.

82
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:14,080
(Luo's Residence)

83
00:05:22,428 --> 00:05:23,400
Old Madam,

84
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:25,360
did anything happen

85
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,798
to Seventh Lady?

86
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,600
Tell me.

87
00:05:32,142 --> 00:05:35,142
Did you leave the Luo's Residence
without hesitation back then

88
00:05:36,357 --> 00:05:38,509
to protect Yining?

89
00:05:43,057 --> 00:05:45,160
I couldn't get around it.

90
00:05:45,792 --> 00:05:47,017
After Minglan's demise,

91
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,963
you dismissed those

92
00:05:49,044 --> 00:05:50,634
who attended to her almost immediately.

93
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:53,400
What are you trying to hide?

94
00:05:55,878 --> 00:05:57,931
I thought you were cold-hearted.

95
00:05:58,611 --> 00:06:01,166
But you raised and sent Qing Qu

96
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,960
who is skilled in medicine
and martial arts

97
00:06:03,468 --> 00:06:05,298
to Yining's side.

98
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:07,080
This shows

99
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,320
you've always cared about her.

100
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,960
If you cared,

101
00:06:11,267 --> 00:06:12,319
why did you insist

102
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:14,240
on leaving back then?

103
00:06:18,534 --> 00:06:20,240
Hurry up and speak.

104
00:06:21,007 --> 00:06:22,400
Someone is already investigating

105
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:25,840
Yining's background.

106
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,040
You were brought here

107
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:30,120
under Second Master's instruction.

108
00:06:30,679 --> 00:06:32,719
If you don't tell me the truth,

109
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:35,360
how can I protect Yining?

110
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,080
Seventh Lady is actually not
who she really is.

111
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,138
What?

112
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:43,160
What do you mean?

113
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:44,471
Back then,

114
00:06:45,142 --> 00:06:47,040
both Madam Gu
and Second Master signed

115
00:06:47,174 --> 00:06:49,240
the divorce papers.

116
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,400
But you were opposed

117
00:06:51,481 --> 00:06:52,481
to their divorce.

118
00:06:52,981 --> 00:06:55,160
Madam Gu could only move
to the side yard.

119
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,480
The side yard has always been quiet.

120
00:06:58,581 --> 00:06:59,560
That night,

121
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,320
an intruder broke in

122
00:07:01,896 --> 00:07:03,280
and abducted Madam Gu.

123
00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:04,960
He claimed

124
00:07:05,638 --> 00:07:06,760
he only wanted her

125
00:07:06,942 --> 00:07:08,480
to care for an injured person

126
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,960
and that she wouldn't be harmed.

127
00:07:10,799 --> 00:07:11,638
During that time,

128
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:13,039
we did receive

129
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,320
a letter from Madam Gu

130
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,200
reassuring us that we shouldn't worry

131
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:17,680
or report it to the household.

132
00:07:18,741 --> 00:07:19,820
Not long after,

133
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:20,961
Madam Gu

134
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,960
was indeed safely returned.

135
00:07:23,845 --> 00:07:26,159
She looked perfectly fine.

136
00:07:26,492 --> 00:07:27,440
However, it wasn't long

137
00:07:27,942 --> 00:07:29,200
before she became pregnant.

138
00:07:30,392 --> 00:07:32,480
Servants like us were simply happy.

139
00:07:32,734 --> 00:07:34,680
We were unaware
of the underlying circumstances.

140
00:07:35,564 --> 00:07:36,480
Later,

141
00:07:36,845 --> 00:07:39,119
Madam Gu became increasingly depressed.

142
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,280
She was unable to eat or sleep well

143
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,200
and fell into a state of distress.

144
00:07:43,932 --> 00:07:45,333
After repeatedly questioning her,

145
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:47,900
she finally revealed the truth.

146
00:07:51,695 --> 00:07:52,736
The child...

147
00:07:55,192 --> 00:07:57,040
The child was not Second Master's.

148
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:03,720
So

149
00:08:05,908 --> 00:08:07,720
she refused to return to Luo's Residence

150
00:08:09,204 --> 00:08:11,083
and stayed in the side yard

151
00:08:13,182 --> 00:08:14,920
because of this reason.

152
00:08:15,775 --> 00:08:17,920
In her dying moments,

153
00:08:18,612 --> 00:08:19,960
the child

154
00:08:20,846 --> 00:08:22,280
was her only worry.

155
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,275
To avoid suspicion

156
00:08:24,356 --> 00:08:26,680
about Seventh Lady's origins,

157
00:08:27,734 --> 00:08:29,240
I dismissed the servants.

158
00:08:29,753 --> 00:08:31,154
As long as we weren't around,

159
00:08:32,093 --> 00:08:33,053
no one

160
00:08:33,655 --> 00:08:35,160
would know about this.

161
00:08:40,175 --> 00:08:41,640
For so many years,

162
00:08:43,363 --> 00:08:46,960
I've been suffering sleepless nights

163
00:08:47,816 --> 00:08:49,280
and unable to enjoy my food.

164
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,320
I have wronged Minglan.

165
00:08:55,421 --> 00:08:56,560
It is me.

166
00:09:02,646 --> 00:09:03,640
Old Madam.

167
00:09:04,658 --> 00:09:07,080
If you do not want this child now,

168
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,270
I

169
00:09:08,774 --> 00:09:10,160
can take her away immediately.

170
00:09:11,742 --> 00:09:12,960
Take her away?

171
00:09:15,718 --> 00:09:17,800
She's the granddaughter I raised.

172
00:09:19,022 --> 00:09:21,063
No one can take her away.

173
00:09:42,494 --> 00:09:43,294
Young Lady,

174
00:09:43,837 --> 00:09:45,278
you've been standing for a long time.

175
00:09:45,359 --> 00:09:46,400
You should rest.

176
00:09:47,614 --> 00:09:49,040
Has Ms. Zheng arrived?

177
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,189
There's still no news.

178
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:56,575
Qing Qu.

179
00:09:58,638 --> 00:10:00,879
If I truly am not the bloodline
of the Luo family...

180
00:10:01,335 --> 00:10:02,840
I will still follow you.

181
00:10:03,758 --> 00:10:04,760
Wherever you go,

182
00:10:05,014 --> 00:10:05,975
I will follow.

183
00:10:07,048 --> 00:10:08,680
Didn't you say

184
00:10:08,768 --> 00:10:10,870
that once we get to the bottom
of Madam Gu's situation,

185
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,280
you would leave Luo's Residence?

186
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:16,440
You're right.

187
00:10:18,006 --> 00:10:19,377
In this vast world,

188
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:22,520
there's surely a place for me.

189
00:10:24,301 --> 00:10:25,320
But

190
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:28,920
I cannot let my mother suffer
such unjust treatment.

191
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:33,600
Who was it

192
00:10:34,368 --> 00:10:35,840
that abducted Minglan?

193
00:10:36,613 --> 00:10:37,840
We are not sure.

194
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:40,280
I only remember

195
00:10:40,595 --> 00:10:42,360
that person dressed as a soldier

196
00:10:42,622 --> 00:10:43,760
and appeared to be injured.

197
00:10:46,551 --> 00:10:47,480
I remember now.

198
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,479
He asked

199
00:10:49,559 --> 00:10:51,720
Madam Gu to go and help a general.

200
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,520
But after that,

201
00:10:53,728 --> 00:10:55,320
we never saw them again.

202
00:10:55,455 --> 00:10:56,767
What a tragic fate.

203
00:10:57,719 --> 00:11:01,000
Truly a tragic fate.

204
00:11:02,668 --> 00:11:03,960
You can leave now.

205
00:11:06,871 --> 00:11:07,671
Wait.

206
00:11:08,855 --> 00:11:09,776
Tomorrow,

207
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,000
you should know what to answer

208
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,759
when Second Master asks
you questions.

209
00:11:20,327 --> 00:11:21,487
Old Madam,

210
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:23,918
I will bring everything

211
00:11:24,076 --> 00:11:25,480
to my grave.

212
00:11:59,462 --> 00:12:00,509
You can come out now.

213
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,439
Did you hear

214
00:12:23,267 --> 00:12:24,556
what was just said?

215
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:25,960
Yes.

216
00:12:27,239 --> 00:12:28,160
I heard it all.

217
00:12:28,854 --> 00:12:30,055
Please rest assured, Grandma.

218
00:12:30,353 --> 00:12:31,920
Regardless of Yining's identity,

219
00:12:32,255 --> 00:12:34,236
I will protect her for life.

220
00:12:40,418 --> 00:12:41,595
That is still not enough.

221
00:12:43,275 --> 00:12:45,520
I want you to swear to me right now.

222
00:12:46,017 --> 00:12:47,640
No matter what happens,

223
00:12:47,878 --> 00:12:50,520
you must protect Yining.

224
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,595
Do it now!

225
00:12:54,893 --> 00:12:55,728
Yes.

226
00:13:04,293 --> 00:13:07,280
I, Luo Shenyuan, swear to the heavens

227
00:13:08,365 --> 00:13:09,607
that in this life,

228
00:13:10,295 --> 00:13:12,120
no matter what happens,

229
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,920
I will protect Yining

230
00:13:15,439 --> 00:13:17,320
and ensure she suffers no harm.

231
00:13:17,606 --> 00:13:18,642
Should I break this vow,

232
00:13:20,949 --> 00:13:24,619
may the heavens forsake me,
and may I die a horrific death.

00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:32,920
Young Master, it's all my fault.

235
00:13:33,008 --> 00:13:34,280
I failed to keep an eye on Mrs. An

236
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,160
and let her escape.

237
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:37,390
It's pointless to talk about this now.

238
00:13:37,392 --> 00:13:39,472
I'm going to the side yard.
So get the horses ready.

239
00:13:39,879 --> 00:13:40,679
Yes, Young Master.

Young Lady, who left this note?

This is in Third Brother's handwriting.

266
00:16:13,915 --> 00:16:15,395
Where is Madam Gu's portrait?

267
00:16:16,343 --> 00:16:17,143
Young Lady.

268
00:16:19,675 --> 00:16:20,475
Young Lady.

269
00:16:20,515 --> 00:16:22,691
Old Madam suddenly returned
to the residence last night.

270
00:16:22,754 --> 00:16:25,184
I thought Grandma was supposed
to return in a few days.

271
00:16:25,675 --> 00:16:28,583
I have no idea but she wants you
at Chengjing Hall now.

272
00:16:39,849 --> 00:16:40,795
Old Madam.

273
00:16:43,176 --> 00:16:44,017
Ms. Zheng,

274
00:16:44,648 --> 00:16:45,567
tell me.

275
00:16:46,567 --> 00:16:48,075
What exactly happened

276
00:16:48,568 --> 00:16:50,115
to Minglan in the side yard back then?

277
00:16:50,928 --> 00:16:51,835
Second Master,

278
00:16:52,513 --> 00:16:53,955
I swear

279
00:16:54,129 --> 00:16:56,675
Madam Gu never wronged the Luo family.

280
00:16:59,809 --> 00:17:01,272
You're heartless!

281
00:17:01,661 --> 00:17:02,635
I'm not lying.

282
00:17:02,795 --> 00:17:04,075
Everything I said is the truth.

283
00:17:04,555 --> 00:17:05,469
Madam Chen helped

284
00:17:05,545 --> 00:17:06,755
me pay off my gambling debts.

285
00:17:07,466 --> 00:17:08,395
I only wanted to survive.

286
00:17:08,419 --> 00:17:09,395
You're talking nonsense.

287
00:17:09,706 --> 00:17:10,586
Ms. Zheng,

288
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:12,315
so everything

289
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:13,915
Mrs. An said isn't true,

290
00:17:14,114 --> 00:17:14,914
right?

291
00:17:15,912 --> 00:17:16,817
Seventh Lady,

292
00:17:17,729 --> 00:17:18,675
Madam Gu

293
00:17:18,915 --> 00:17:21,355
definitely did not do anything
to wrong the Luo family.

294
00:17:24,112 --> 00:17:26,635
It is the Luo family that wronged her.

295
00:17:26,691 --> 00:17:29,187
You're in no position to speak
about the Luo family's matters.

296
00:17:29,306 --> 00:17:30,145
Ms. Zheng,

297
00:17:30,392 --> 00:17:32,739
I advise you to speak the truth.

298
00:17:34,278 --> 00:17:35,995
Otherwise,
I will beat you until you say it.

299
00:17:36,465 --> 00:17:37,265
Father,

300
00:17:37,591 --> 00:17:38,911
Ms. Zheng is already old.

301
00:17:39,154 --> 00:17:40,193
She can't take any beating.

302
00:17:40,419 --> 00:17:41,915
Why are we using punishment

303
00:17:42,595 --> 00:17:44,348
when we haven't even asked
a few questions?

304
00:17:50,275 --> 00:17:51,075
Mother.

305
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:52,835
If Ms. Zheng were willing to speak,

306
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:55,635
she wouldn't have hidden this matter
all this time.

307
00:17:55,683 --> 00:17:57,715
This matter concerns
the Luo family's bloodline.

308
00:17:58,208 --> 00:17:59,795
We can't let it slide.

309
00:18:00,232 --> 00:18:01,033
Ms. Zheng,

310
00:18:01,129 --> 00:18:02,689
please tell the truth.

311
00:18:02,835 --> 00:18:04,874
We've suffered so much over the years.

312
00:18:04,954 --> 00:18:06,356
We have helped more than enough.

313
00:18:06,437 --> 00:18:07,692
You're truly despicable.

314
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:09,195
Have you forgotten

315
00:18:09,235 --> 00:18:10,643
how Madam Gu treated you back then?

316
00:18:10,675 --> 00:18:11,715
Tell me the truth.

317
00:18:14,008 --> 00:18:15,355
I said, tell me the truth!

318
00:18:17,434 --> 00:18:18,434
Not going to speak, huh?

319
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,361
Fine.

320
00:18:21,635 --> 00:18:23,155
- Butler Bai!
- Yes.

321
00:18:23,356 --> 00:18:24,315
Take her away

322
00:18:24,396 --> 00:18:25,356
and beat her mercilessly!

323
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:26,475
Beat her to death!

324
00:18:27,058 --> 00:18:27,858
Yes.

325
00:18:28,168 --> 00:18:29,008
Stop it!

326
00:18:32,177 --> 00:18:32,997
Go away!

327
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:34,114
Let Ms. Zheng go!

328
00:18:34,266 --> 00:18:35,145
Get in the way, huh?

329
00:18:35,226 --> 00:18:36,306
Drag her along too!

330
00:18:36,355 --> 00:18:37,427
Don't you dare touch Yining!

331
00:18:37,459 --> 00:18:38,275
Let go!

332
00:18:38,771 --> 00:18:39,930
Who told you to stop?

333
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:42,275
Since when did Lin Hairu take charge
of this family?

334
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:43,595
Beat her!

335
00:18:43,714 --> 00:18:44,555
Don't you dare!

336
00:18:45,981 --> 00:18:47,434
- Let go!
- Stop it!

337
00:18:54,515 --> 00:18:55,395
Why?

338
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:58,635
Are you ignoring what I say now?

339
00:18:59,558 --> 00:19:00,731
How dare you!

340
00:19:11,657 --> 00:19:12,457
Mother,

341
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:16,106
I only want to seek the truth.

342
00:19:23,106 --> 00:19:23,906
I...

343
00:19:33,649 --> 00:19:34,449
Grandma.

344
00:19:36,154 --> 00:19:36,954
Mother.

345
00:19:38,129 --> 00:19:39,609
This matter is all because of me.

346
00:19:40,368 --> 00:19:41,875
I'm willing to go to the woodshed.

347
00:19:53,217 --> 00:19:54,017
Yining.

348
00:20:02,867 --> 00:20:04,075
I'd like to ask you something.

349
00:20:04,099 --> 00:20:05,425
Have you seen this person before?

350
00:20:08,353 --> 00:20:09,195
No.

351
00:20:09,276 --> 00:20:10,076
All right.

352
00:20:12,675 --> 00:20:13,516
Excuse me.

353
00:20:13,874 --> 00:20:14,995
I'd like to ask you something.

354
00:20:15,755 --> 00:20:16,714
Over a decade ago,

355
00:20:16,795 --> 00:20:18,635
did a band of bandits appear
around here?

356
00:20:19,270 --> 00:20:20,074
- Yes.
- Yes.

357
00:20:20,155 --> 00:20:20,955
Yes, there was.

358
00:20:24,503 --> 00:20:25,875
According to the two elders,

359
00:20:26,114 --> 00:20:27,515
this is probably what happened.

360
00:20:28,504 --> 00:20:29,424
I see.

361
00:20:29,635 --> 00:20:31,185
This place is only
about three or four li

362
00:20:31,194 --> 00:20:32,235
from the Taoyuan side yard

363
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:34,115
It'll be closer
if we take the mountain road.

364
00:20:34,286 --> 00:20:36,315
It must be this group of people

365
00:20:36,355 --> 00:20:37,715
who kidnapped Madam Gu back then.

366
00:20:37,992 --> 00:20:39,075
We need to find out

367
00:20:39,266 --> 00:20:40,626
who led the troops at that time.

368
00:20:41,626 --> 00:20:42,426
Yes, Young Master.

369
00:20:51,713 --> 00:20:52,554
Ms. Zheng.

370
00:20:53,677 --> 00:20:55,115
- Let's go.
- Ms. Zheng.

371
00:20:56,977 --> 00:20:57,818
Ms. Zheng.

372
00:20:59,603 --> 00:21:00,763
Seventh Lady,

373
00:21:01,992 --> 00:21:03,475
I'm useless.

374
00:21:04,473 --> 00:21:06,313
I failed to protect you.

375
00:21:06,394 --> 00:21:07,675
Don't say that.

376
00:21:09,028 --> 00:21:10,114
All of this is my fault.

377
00:21:10,225 --> 00:21:11,266
I implicated you.

378
00:21:11,912 --> 00:21:13,113
Seventh Lady,

379
00:21:14,113 --> 00:21:15,075
I

380
00:21:16,248 --> 00:21:17,435
only hope

381
00:21:18,185 --> 00:21:20,684
that you don't blame Madam Gu.

382
00:21:22,642 --> 00:21:25,195
What do you mean by this?

383
00:21:30,842 --> 00:21:31,642
My...

384
00:21:33,848 --> 00:21:35,315
My birth father...

385
00:21:39,026 --> 00:21:40,586
I don't know who he is either.

386
00:21:41,362 --> 00:21:42,401
But

387
00:21:43,648 --> 00:21:45,275
don't hate Madam Gu.

388
00:21:46,545 --> 00:21:48,614
Before she left for the side yard,

389
00:21:48,995 --> 00:21:52,915
she had already divorced
Second Master.

390
00:21:53,721 --> 00:21:55,341
Madam Gu said

391
00:21:56,475 --> 00:21:57,356
that person treated

392
00:21:58,042 --> 00:21:59,555
her very well.

393
00:21:59,969 --> 00:22:03,009
He is not a womanizer

394
00:22:03,418 --> 00:22:04,995
or lecherous.

395
00:22:06,035 --> 00:22:06,995
At first,

396
00:22:07,394 --> 00:22:10,434
Madam Gu refused to leave with him

397
00:22:11,075 --> 00:22:13,283
because she was concerned
about the family's reputation.

398
00:22:14,186 --> 00:22:15,355
After she returned,

399
00:22:17,177 --> 00:22:20,235
she found out she was pregnant.

400
00:22:21,531 --> 00:22:22,955
So she went looking for him.

401
00:22:23,752 --> 00:22:25,235
But couldn't find him.

402
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:34,075
She asked me

403
00:22:34,634 --> 00:22:36,915
to give this to you

404
00:22:37,098 --> 00:22:38,835
before she passed.

405
00:22:39,985 --> 00:22:43,427
I took it with me

406
00:22:44,217 --> 00:22:46,155
to avoid trouble for you.

407
00:22:51,849 --> 00:22:52,835
But now,

408
00:22:53,657 --> 00:22:54,995
it's time to return it to you.

409
00:22:56,432 --> 00:22:57,952
No matter what,

410
00:22:58,786 --> 00:22:59,995
Madam Gu

411
00:23:01,424 --> 00:23:05,216
always thought of you.

412
00:23:05,778 --> 00:23:09,755
She wanted to stay in the side yard

413
00:23:11,322 --> 00:23:13,435
and watch you grow up.

414
00:23:19,129 --> 00:23:20,049
Ms. Zheng,

415
00:23:21,664 --> 00:23:23,075
you've suffered too much

416
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:25,075
because of me.

417
00:23:27,233 --> 00:23:28,739
If Father asks,

418
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:31,875
just tell the truth

419
00:23:33,035 --> 00:23:34,645
since it's a fact.

420
00:23:37,601 --> 00:23:39,795
I will keep my promise to Madam Gu

421
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:44,720
until the day I die.

422
00:23:57,347 --> 00:23:58,835
I've reported it to the authorities.

423
00:23:59,569 --> 00:24:00,995
The guards are waiting outside.

424
00:24:05,154 --> 00:24:05,954
Aren't you afraid

425
00:24:06,035 --> 00:24:07,714
I'll expose

426
00:24:08,275 --> 00:24:09,458
your family's scandals?

427
00:24:11,267 --> 00:24:12,275
You gave birth

428
00:24:12,757 --> 00:24:14,955
to all three children of Chengwen.

429
00:24:15,273 --> 00:24:16,475
Their futures are

430
00:24:16,782 --> 00:24:18,235
in your hands.

431
00:24:23,758 --> 00:24:25,475
When we reach the court,

432
00:24:25,795 --> 00:24:27,035
think carefully

433
00:24:27,439 --> 00:24:29,155
about what to say.

434
00:24:30,216 --> 00:24:31,275
Old Madam,

435
00:24:32,323 --> 00:24:34,965
my children and Gu Minglan's child
are your descendants.

436
00:24:35,114 --> 00:24:36,874
But you've always favored Gu Minglan!

437
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:37,929
Now,

438
00:24:38,035 --> 00:24:39,927
you still want to threaten us.

439
00:24:40,044 --> 00:24:41,235
Listen to me carefully.

440
00:24:41,402 --> 00:24:43,282
You're no longer part of the Luo family.

441
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:46,817
Your name will never be associated
with Luo's Residence.

442
00:24:52,905 --> 00:24:53,875
Luo Chengwen,

443
00:24:54,115 --> 00:24:56,567
are you going to allow your wife
and children to be trampled?

444
00:24:56,966 --> 00:24:58,275
Are you a man?

445
00:24:58,355 --> 00:24:59,466
Are you?

446
00:24:59,547 --> 00:25:00,484
Do you realize

447
00:25:00,485 --> 00:25:01,555
everything that's happening

448
00:25:01,752 --> 00:25:03,755
is your fault?

449
00:25:05,673 --> 00:25:07,675
It's all your fault!

450
00:25:12,249 --> 00:25:13,130
Chen Lan,

451
00:25:14,657 --> 00:25:15,875
this is it.

452
00:25:17,543 --> 00:25:18,915
We've been married for thirty years.

453
00:25:20,089 --> 00:25:21,395
From now on,

454
00:25:22,696 --> 00:25:24,015
we are no longer bound

455
00:25:24,739 --> 00:25:26,459
as husband and wife.

456
00:25:27,488 --> 00:25:28,688
You should leave now.

457
00:25:29,714 --> 00:25:30,874
Let me go.

458
00:25:31,075 --> 00:25:32,195
I can walk on my own!

459
00:25:33,129 --> 00:25:33,995
Old Madam.

460
00:25:38,364 --> 00:25:39,559
Your family

461
00:25:40,155 --> 00:25:41,825
will face retribution!

462
00:26:05,255 --> 00:26:06,395
Mother.

463
00:26:06,684 --> 00:26:07,875
Mother.

464
00:26:09,641 --> 00:26:11,035
Mother.

465
00:26:15,401 --> 00:26:16,315
Don't go.

466
00:26:17,527 --> 00:26:18,515
Mother.

467
00:26:19,866 --> 00:26:20,875
Mother.

468
00:26:22,403 --> 00:26:24,875
Mother, don't go.

469
00:26:26,098 --> 00:26:27,715
Mother.

470
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,799
Mother.

471
00:26:35,854 --> 00:26:37,555
Don't go.

472
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,700
Mother!

473
00:26:48,168 --> 00:26:50,235
Mother!

474
00:27:24,122 --> 00:27:25,003
Ms. Zheng.

475
00:27:41,364 --> 00:27:42,635
Is there anyone out there?

476
00:27:42,824 --> 00:27:44,155
Ms. Zheng passed out.

477
00:27:44,408 --> 00:27:45,595
Please send some medicine over.

478
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:48,155
I don't have a final say in that.

479
00:28:10,168 --> 00:28:10,915
My dear,

480
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:13,195
getting agitated is bad for your health.

481
00:28:13,911 --> 00:28:16,475
Old Madam had to take
the musk heart-saving pill too.

482
00:28:19,121 --> 00:28:20,155
Get Physician Li.

483
00:28:23,275 --> 00:28:24,075
My dear,

484
00:28:25,875 --> 00:28:28,435
let Yining out.

485
00:28:28,618 --> 00:28:29,515
Why should I?

486
00:28:30,937 --> 00:28:32,115
For what reason?

487
00:28:33,171 --> 00:28:34,555
So she can embarrass me even more?

488
00:28:36,161 --> 00:28:37,555
This has nothing to do with Yining.

489
00:28:38,456 --> 00:28:39,536
She didn't lie to you

490
00:28:40,371 --> 00:28:41,675
and she's still a child.

491
00:28:41,755 --> 00:28:43,811
Her mother and she
have deceived me for so many years.

492
00:28:44,614 --> 00:28:46,634
She is the shame
that Gu Minglan left for me.

493
00:28:46,833 --> 00:28:48,595
She wanted everyone to laugh at me!

494
00:28:50,337 --> 00:28:51,875
Why blame a child

495
00:28:52,432 --> 00:28:54,195
for the affairs of adults back then?

496
00:28:57,463 --> 00:28:59,122
Lin Hairu, I'm warning you.

497
00:28:59,875 --> 00:29:01,239
Stop speaking up for her.

498
00:29:05,959 --> 00:29:07,035
All I know

499
00:29:07,907 --> 00:29:10,035
is that Yining has been addressing me
as her mother.

500
00:29:10,538 --> 00:29:11,795
I can't let her suffer.

501
00:29:13,427 --> 00:29:15,106
I may not have given birth to her.

502
00:29:15,463 --> 00:29:16,715
But she's like one to me.

503
00:29:17,669 --> 00:29:18,715
Is blood relation really

504
00:29:18,796 --> 00:29:19,661
that important to you?

505
00:29:19,742 --> 00:29:20,863
Of course, it is!

506
00:29:21,744 --> 00:29:23,035
If I knew,

507
00:29:23,555 --> 00:29:25,355
I wouldn't have let her live.

508
00:29:25,575 --> 00:29:27,355
How can you be so ruthless?

509
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:28,354
What did you say?

510
00:29:29,598 --> 00:29:31,075
Who's ruthless?

511
00:29:31,353 --> 00:29:32,675
Who are you calling ruthless?

512
00:29:33,618 --> 00:29:34,418
Get out.

513
00:29:34,905 --> 00:29:35,995
Get out!

514
00:30:13,281 --> 00:30:14,081
Yilian,

515
00:30:14,291 --> 00:30:15,535
how is Mistress Qiao's situation?

516
00:30:18,122 --> 00:30:19,235
She's in prison.

517
00:30:19,515 --> 00:30:21,235
What good outcome could there be?

518
00:30:22,241 --> 00:30:23,372
I checked the criminal code.

519
00:30:23,731 --> 00:30:25,995
If an accomplice confesses,
it can be reduced by three levels.

520
00:30:26,129 --> 00:30:27,388
It shouldn't be too severe.

521
00:30:29,497 --> 00:30:32,595
Mistress Qiao is already weak.

522
00:30:33,075 --> 00:30:34,817
We don't even know

523
00:30:34,898 --> 00:30:36,715
if she can endure these years in prison.

524
00:30:41,282 --> 00:30:42,315
Xuan,

525
00:30:43,162 --> 00:30:44,715
you must study hard.

526
00:30:44,905 --> 00:30:46,155
If you succeed in the future

527
00:30:46,531 --> 00:30:48,075
and become an official,

528
00:30:48,362 --> 00:30:49,243
perhaps...

529
00:30:49,536 --> 00:30:51,515
Perhaps, you could get
Mistress Qiao out of prison.

530
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:53,915
All right.

531
00:30:55,337 --> 00:30:56,235
Then I'll get going.

532
00:31:21,159 --> 00:31:22,038
Father.

533
00:31:24,566 --> 00:31:25,367
Father.

534
00:31:25,786 --> 00:31:26,744
If this scandal

535
00:31:26,825 --> 00:31:28,275
gets out,

536
00:31:28,848 --> 00:31:30,474
what of the Luo Residence's reputation

537
00:31:30,609 --> 00:31:32,155
and your reputation?

538
00:31:33,377 --> 00:31:35,315
This matter is none of your concern.

539
00:31:36,115 --> 00:31:37,234
I know

540
00:31:37,377 --> 00:31:39,075
I shouldn't interfere.

541
00:31:39,536 --> 00:31:41,435
I only feel it's unfair to you

542
00:31:41,776 --> 00:31:43,835
to suffer such deception
for so many years.

543
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,195
Everyone says I'm ruthless and unfilial.

544
00:31:52,736 --> 00:31:54,302
I never expected you to be the first

545
00:31:54,375 --> 00:31:56,147
to feel the matter is unjust
on my behalf.

546
00:32:02,661 --> 00:32:04,195
Grandma and Madam Lin

547
00:32:04,634 --> 00:32:06,275
have always favored Yining.

548
00:32:06,681 --> 00:32:07,642
Naturally,

549
00:32:07,858 --> 00:32:09,595
they want to minimize this matter

550
00:32:09,745 --> 00:32:10,817
and sweep it under the rug.

551
00:32:10,898 --> 00:32:11,777
They probably

552
00:32:11,858 --> 00:32:12,825
want Yining to continue

553
00:32:12,906 --> 00:32:14,546
as the Seventh Lady
of the Luo's Residence.

554
00:32:14,627 --> 00:32:15,508
That's impossible.

555
00:32:15,796 --> 00:32:17,520
Therefore,

556
00:32:17,776 --> 00:32:20,223
you must resolve this matter swiftly

557
00:32:20,304 --> 00:32:21,743
while Grandma

558
00:32:21,824 --> 00:32:22,995
is still bedridden.

559
00:32:25,897 --> 00:32:27,317
I spoke out of turn.

560
00:32:32,216 --> 00:32:33,635
I know what to do. You can leave now.

561
00:32:59,601 --> 00:33:00,473
Excuse me.

562
00:33:00,867 --> 00:33:02,235
I'd like to ask you about someone.

563
00:33:05,713 --> 00:33:07,294
I've seen this portrait before.

564
00:33:07,792 --> 00:33:08,958
Do you remember

565
00:33:09,035 --> 00:33:10,883
who came looking for the woman
in this portrait?

566
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:12,370
Ah.

567
00:33:12,768 --> 00:33:14,515
It was over a decade ago.

568
00:33:14,929 --> 00:33:15,911
Do you remember

569
00:33:16,697 --> 00:33:19,035
what the person was like?

570
00:33:20,617 --> 00:33:22,169
I think he was a general.

571
00:33:22,530 --> 00:33:23,356
I remember

572
00:33:23,437 --> 00:33:25,716
his subordinates calling him

573
00:33:26,681 --> 00:33:27,635
General Wei.

574
00:33:29,842 --> 00:33:30,642
Thank you.

575
00:33:36,416 --> 00:33:39,315
The only general
with the last name Wei at the time

576
00:33:40,083 --> 00:33:41,435
would be Duke Ying.

577
00:33:42,232 --> 00:33:43,032
That's right.

578
00:33:43,248 --> 00:33:45,435
Duke Ying has never married

579
00:33:45,722 --> 00:33:47,195
and doesn't even have a concubine.

580
00:33:47,347 --> 00:33:48,715
Many rumors are circulating about him.

581
00:33:48,889 --> 00:33:49,915
Could it be

582
00:33:50,209 --> 00:33:51,955
that he has been waiting for Madam Gu?

583
00:33:53,976 --> 00:33:55,595
We can only find out
by asking him directly.

584
00:33:55,962 --> 00:33:56,762
Let's go.

00:33:58,355 --> 00:34:01,075

586
00:34:07,632 --> 00:34:08,584
My name is Luo Shenyuan.

587
00:34:08,585 --> 00:34:09,914
I request an audience with Duke Ying.

588
00:34:09,915 --> 00:34:10,925
Do you have a visiting card?

589
00:34:10,931 --> 00:34:12,695
I came in such a rush
that I couldn't prepare.

590
00:34:12,777 --> 00:34:13,977
Please convey my message.

591
00:34:14,278 --> 00:34:16,028
I have something important

592
00:34:16,083 --> 00:34:17,987
that I need to personally hand
to Duke Ying.

593
00:34:18,015 --> 00:34:19,875
Without a visiting card,
you cannot enter

594

have been seeking all these years!

598
00:34:32,657 --> 00:34:35,035
So you are the young master
of the Luo's Residence.

599
00:34:35,537 --> 00:34:37,692
No wonder you have the testimony
from Minister Luo.

600
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:38,860
Regarding the testimony,

601
00:34:39,298 --> 00:34:40,698
I must thank you

602
00:34:40,755 --> 00:34:42,083
for your assistance, Duke Ying.

603
00:34:42,099 --> 00:34:43,395
Earlier, you shouted

604
00:34:43,476 --> 00:34:45,435
that you knew who I was looking for.

605
00:34:45,867 --> 00:34:46,755

Her name is Gu Minglan.

608
00:35:24,928 --> 00:35:27,875
She was Madam Gu
of the Luo's Residence's second home.

Gu Minglan?

610
00:35:30,185 --> 00:35:31,755
But she divorced a long time ago.

611
00:35:32,515 --> 00:35:33,795
Later, she moved

612
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,275
to live in the Taoyuan side yard.

613
00:35:39,657 --> 00:35:40,755

614
00:35:46,257 --> 00:35:47,275
Then it's her.

615
00:35:48,815 --> 00:35:49,795

She died from poisoning.

620
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:00,075
Who did it?

621
00:36:00,217 --> 00:36:02,377
The person
who poisoned her is in prison.

622
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:05,515
Gu Minglan left behind a daughter.

623

A daughter?

624

She's the Seventh Lady
of the Luo's Residence.

Her name is Luo Yining.

626

It has now been confirmed

627
00:36:13,763 --> 00:36:15,435
that she is not
of the Luo family bloodline.

00:36:16,082 --> 00:36:17,715

As far as I know,

696
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:47,595
before I even met Gu Minglan,

697
00:41:47,706 --> 00:41:49,115

00:41:51,722 --> 00:41:52,815
Divorce?

700
00:41:53,368 --> 00:41:55,823
