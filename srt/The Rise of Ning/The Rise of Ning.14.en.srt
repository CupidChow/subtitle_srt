=The Rise of Ning=

00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,320
(Adapted from Wen Tan's novel "Chancellor
Training Handbook" from Jinjiang Literature)

3
00:01:36,634 --> 00:01:38,665
=Episode 14=

4
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:53,827
Are you ready?

5
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,519
Not yet, Young Master.

6
00:01:56,146 --> 00:01:57,745
The Imperial Guards beat us to it.

7
00:01:57,906 --> 00:01:58,706
They've surrounded

8
00:01:58,752 --> 00:01:59,648
Daci Temple completely.

9
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,648
They even posted a wanted notice
for Senior Daoyan.

10
00:02:02,826 --> 00:02:05,426
We must find them
before the Imperial Guards do.

11
00:02:05,505 --> 00:02:05,986
Understood.

12
00:02:06,505 --> 00:02:07,305
But, Young Master,

13
00:02:07,505 --> 00:02:08,666
considering today's situation,

14
00:02:08,986 --> 00:02:10,499
even if we find Senior Daoyan,

15
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,400
it's difficult to bring him
back to Liuhe Tavern.

16
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:14,345
Chase them down.

17
00:02:16,025 --> 00:02:16,865
Search thoroughly.

18
00:02:19,506 --> 00:02:19,946
Let's go.

19
00:02:37,456 --> 00:02:38,496
Split up and search.

20
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,320
(Chen Daoyan)

21
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:25,506
Looks like I'll have to fight
to the death.

22
00:03:25,986 --> 00:03:26,585
Come on, then!

23
00:03:27,025 --> 00:03:28,826
I, Chen Daoyan,
would rather die standing

24
00:03:28,905 --> 00:03:30,465
than surrender.

25
00:03:30,865 --> 00:03:31,585
Get him.

26
00:03:50,106 --> 00:03:51,585
It's you again.

27
00:03:51,905 --> 00:03:52,783
I'll hold them off.

28
00:03:52,784 --> 00:03:53,920
Take Senior back to the manor.

29
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:54,465
Yes.

30
00:03:55,706 --> 00:03:56,106
Go!

31
00:05:08,545 --> 00:05:10,706
Mount up and pursue separately.

32
00:05:11,225 --> 00:05:11,706
Yes.

33
00:05:33,506 --> 00:05:35,225
Why are you drinking here?

34
00:05:45,905 --> 00:05:48,465
I heard you had an argument
with my second aunt.

35
00:05:55,266 --> 00:05:57,225
You really don't want
to take the exam, huh?

36
00:05:57,905 --> 00:06:00,146
A bird should become a phoenix,

37
00:06:01,025 --> 00:06:03,706
and a fish must transform into a Kun.

38
00:06:05,386 --> 00:06:07,025
But I'm neither a bird nor a fish.

39
00:06:07,905 --> 00:06:09,626
How could I become a phoenix or a Kun?

40
00:06:10,225 --> 00:06:11,386
But

41
00:06:12,465 --> 00:06:14,066
even a goose

42
00:06:14,545 --> 00:06:16,985
would probably want to be a swan.

43
00:06:17,386 --> 00:06:19,146
Why envy a swan?

44
00:06:20,186 --> 00:06:21,425
My mother always wants me

45
00:06:21,475 --> 00:06:23,475
to be gentle and graceful
like my elder sister.

46
00:06:23,985 --> 00:06:25,946
But I just can't do it.

47
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,820
If you don't want
to take the exam,

48
00:06:27,915 --> 00:06:29,355
why not talk to my second aunt?

49
00:06:31,506 --> 00:06:32,985
Hairu has her difficulties.

50
00:06:33,344 --> 00:06:35,300
She married into the Luo family
as a second wife,

51
00:06:35,905 --> 00:06:37,386
just because my father thought

52
00:06:37,746 --> 00:06:39,345
the Luo family's scholarly reputation

53
00:06:39,706 --> 00:06:41,946
could pave a path for me

54
00:06:42,225 --> 00:06:44,585
and my family.

55
00:06:45,585 --> 00:06:47,066
When I was sent to Hairu,

56
00:06:47,386 --> 00:06:49,066
she took on that responsibility.

57
00:06:49,506 --> 00:06:51,105
If I gave up now,

58
00:06:52,025 --> 00:06:53,665
she would surely be blamed.

59
00:06:54,225 --> 00:06:55,826
Why does it always have to be like this?

60
00:06:56,866 --> 00:06:58,306
I used to think

61
00:06:58,425 --> 00:07:00,585
my mother wanted me to lose weight
for my own good.

62
00:07:00,826 --> 00:07:02,066
Later, I realized

63
00:07:02,785 --> 00:07:04,866
she just wanted me to improve

64
00:07:04,946 --> 00:07:06,665
so I could marry into a better family.

65
00:07:07,105 --> 00:07:09,066
That way, I could support my brothers.

66
00:07:09,266 --> 00:07:11,585
I always feel like a gift,

67
00:07:12,025 --> 00:07:14,066
carefully wrapped and given away

68
00:07:14,266 --> 00:07:16,146
in exchange for something else.

69
00:07:19,545 --> 00:07:20,306
You…

70
00:07:22,465 --> 00:07:24,425
You're quite a hefty gift.

71
00:07:24,452 --> 00:07:25,613
What do you mean?

72
00:07:28,066 --> 00:07:30,506
This world really is unfair to women.

73
00:07:31,052 --> 00:07:32,532
But have you ever thought,

74
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:35,040
if you don't marry into a good family,

75
00:07:35,585 --> 00:07:36,866
what will you do?

76
00:07:37,785 --> 00:07:40,083
Will you just stay here
eating and drinking?

77
00:07:41,665 --> 00:07:43,386
I hadn't really thought about it.

78
00:07:43,746 --> 00:07:45,746
What about you? What will you do?

79
00:07:46,768 --> 00:07:48,780
Drawing a blade only makes
the water flow faster,

80
00:07:48,784 --> 00:07:50,784
drinking to forget only makes
the sorrow deeper.

81
00:07:50,866 --> 00:07:52,585
Of course, I'll take the imperial exam.

82
00:07:53,066 --> 00:07:54,345
Even though I'll surely fail,

83
00:07:54,785 --> 00:07:55,866
at least

84
00:07:55,868 --> 00:07:57,387
no one will blame my sister.

85
00:07:57,552 --> 00:07:58,740
If anyone were to be blamed,

86
00:07:58,866 --> 00:08:00,105
it would be me for being useless.

87
00:08:02,545 --> 00:08:03,306
Alright then,

88
00:08:03,626 --> 00:08:04,866
I've decided as well.

89
00:08:05,186 --> 00:08:07,306
Until I figure out what I want to do,

90
00:08:07,425 --> 00:08:09,585
I won't lose weight.

91
00:08:09,905 --> 00:08:12,383
That way, I can stop my mother
from sending me away.

92
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,192
Worst case, I'll just get scolded
every day.

93
00:08:14,985 --> 00:08:15,785
Well said.

94
00:08:16,585 --> 00:08:18,995
One day, we'll show them all

95
00:08:19,345 --> 00:08:21,386
that we are no ordinary people,

96
00:08:21,465 --> 00:08:23,465
but we are bold people.

97
00:08:25,066 --> 00:08:26,626
Why not have a drink before the exam?

98
00:08:26,652 --> 00:08:28,532
Maybe it'll help you pass.

99
00:08:30,306 --> 00:08:32,059
After ten years of study and abuse,

100
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:34,272
if you can't write an essay,
you can at least memorize one.

101
00:08:34,304 --> 00:08:34,700
Come on.

102
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:42,065
Drink up, drink up.

103
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,805
(Luo's Residence)

104
00:08:52,272 --> 00:08:52,992
Your Lordship.

105
00:08:53,746 --> 00:08:55,099
We've searched the entire area.

106
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,192
This is the only place left.

107
00:08:56,226 --> 00:08:57,425
The Luo Residence.

108
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:01,188
Those men in black
from Yuanjing Pavilion appeared again.

109
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,620
And they had Chen Daoyan with them.

110
00:09:02,644 --> 00:09:04,443
They vanished near the Luo Residence.

111
00:09:05,185 --> 00:09:06,626
It seems too much of a coincidence.

112
00:09:06,673 --> 00:09:08,229
Back then, Old Master Luo
risked his life

113
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,824
to leave behind Sun Chengwu's testimony.

114
00:09:10,106 --> 00:09:10,945
The Luo Residence

115
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:12,746
might also be hiding

116
00:09:12,747 --> 00:09:14,347
survivors from the Chen Jiuheng case.

117
00:09:14,945 --> 00:09:16,425
Let's take this opportunity

118
00:09:17,386 --> 00:09:18,859
to investigate Luo Shenyuan.

119
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:20,390
During the incident
at Yuanjing Pavilion,

120
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,074
one of them was wounded by my men.

121
00:09:22,226 --> 00:09:23,665
If we see a wound,

122
00:09:23,905 --> 00:09:24,986
then we know

123
00:09:24,987 --> 00:09:26,147
his true identity.

124
00:09:27,106 --> 00:09:27,586
Proceed.

125
00:09:31,025 --> 00:09:31,586
Open the door.

126
00:09:33,025 --> 00:09:33,705
Open the door!

127
00:09:49,344 --> 00:09:50,970
Marquis Lu, to what do we
owe this pleasure

128
00:09:50,976 --> 00:09:51,920
this late at night?

129
00:09:52,146 --> 00:09:53,346
We were ordered

130
00:09:53,506 --> 00:09:54,746
to capture a major criminal.

131
00:09:54,945 --> 00:09:56,226
We saw him entering over the wall.

132
00:09:56,346 --> 00:09:57,945
Please ask all your family members

133
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,100
to stay inside their quarters

134
00:09:59,185 --> 00:10:00,785
lest they be accidentally harmed.

135
00:10:02,025 --> 00:10:02,986
A major criminal?

136
00:10:04,545 --> 00:10:05,586
Apologies, Registrar Luo.

137
00:10:06,466 --> 00:10:07,226
Search thoroughly.

138
00:10:07,346 --> 00:10:08,146
Yes, sir!

139
00:10:20,506 --> 00:10:22,425
Young Lady, please rest early.

140
00:10:22,443 --> 00:10:23,484
Don't overwork yourself.

141
00:10:23,657 --> 00:10:26,548
Otherwise, Ms. Zheng will blame me
for not taking care of you.

142
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:28,879
Qing Qu,

143
00:10:30,025 --> 00:10:30,986
help me send a letter

144
00:10:30,987 --> 00:10:31,987
to Ms. Zheng.

145
00:10:33,146 --> 00:10:34,266
Tell her

146
00:10:34,466 --> 00:10:36,746
I have a persistent high fever.

147
00:10:36,986 --> 00:10:37,586
Anyway,

148
00:10:37,705 --> 00:10:39,545
just make sure she comes here.

149
00:10:39,825 --> 00:10:40,866
Young Lady, isn't this...

150
00:10:42,106 --> 00:10:43,425
deceiving her?

151
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:45,640
If I don't find out the cause
of my mother's death,

152
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,840
I will never be at peace.

153
00:10:50,825 --> 00:10:51,866
Okay,

154
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:53,266
but this is the last time.

155
00:10:55,025 --> 00:10:55,506
Search.

156
00:10:55,825 --> 00:10:57,185
Leave no stone unturned.

157
00:10:57,266 --> 00:10:57,986
What's wrong?

158
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:00,305
Young Lady.

159
00:11:02,665 --> 00:11:03,626
What happened?

160
00:11:03,825 --> 00:11:05,874
The Imperial Guards suddenly
arrived in numbers.

161
00:11:05,904 --> 00:11:07,780
They say a fugitive is hiding
in our residence.

162
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:09,100
They're searching the entire place.

163
00:11:09,106 --> 00:11:10,545
They ordered us all to stay inside.

164
00:11:10,825 --> 00:11:11,825
The Imperial Guards?

165
00:11:12,425 --> 00:11:13,106
I heard

166
00:11:13,386 --> 00:11:15,386
Marquis Lu is leading the search.

167
00:11:18,305 --> 00:11:19,346
Lu Jiaxue.

168
00:11:52,544 --> 00:11:53,540
Spare the formalities.

169
00:11:53,632 --> 00:11:54,340
I'll help myself.

170
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:09,866
Marquis, may I be so bold as to ask,

171
00:12:10,506 --> 00:12:11,586
what sort of criminal

172
00:12:11,665 --> 00:12:13,226
requires your personal involvement?

173
00:12:13,545 --> 00:12:15,346
An important fugitive, of course.

174
00:12:15,866 --> 00:12:16,626
Otherwise,

175
00:12:16,866 --> 00:12:19,106
I wouldn't be disturbing
your family at this hour.

176
00:12:19,665 --> 00:12:21,025
Please forgive me, Registrar Luo.

177
00:12:22,746 --> 00:12:24,185
No need to apologize, Marquis.

178
00:12:24,586 --> 00:12:26,346
As Registrar
of Imperial Court of Judicial,

179
00:12:26,506 --> 00:12:28,905
I understand the necessity.

180
00:12:44,746 --> 00:12:45,386
Seventh Lady,

181
00:12:45,488 --> 00:12:47,232
we're carrying out official duties.

182
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:48,753
I hope for your understanding.

183
00:12:52,586 --> 00:12:53,065
Search!

184
00:12:53,185 --> 00:12:54,146
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

185
00:13:08,665 --> 00:13:10,305
In three months, at this hour,

186
00:13:10,945 --> 00:13:12,346
let's meet at Meizhou Hill.

187
00:13:12,986 --> 00:13:15,025
My grandpa is Song Yingshan, Governor

188
00:13:15,025 --> 00:13:15,905
of the National Army.

189
00:13:15,945 --> 00:13:17,564
Do you think he'd abandon me

190
00:13:17,565 --> 00:13:19,205
for someone like you?

191
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:21,630
She's dead and that's it.

192
00:13:25,945 --> 00:13:27,106
- Any findings?
- None.

193
00:13:28,986 --> 00:13:29,466
Nothing.

194
00:13:33,065 --> 00:13:33,785
Seventh Lady,

195
00:13:34,106 --> 00:13:35,346
we shall take our leave.

196
00:13:39,746 --> 00:13:40,386
Xue Zhi,

197
00:13:41,665 --> 00:13:43,146
what about Jimo House?

198
00:13:43,586 --> 00:13:45,065
They say they've searched everywhere,

199
00:13:45,066 --> 00:13:46,546
and they're heading to Jimo House next.

200
00:13:47,065 --> 00:13:47,866
It seems

201
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,240
they're targeting

202
00:13:50,425 --> 00:13:52,025
Third Brother.

203
00:13:56,866 --> 00:13:57,386
Young Lady.

204
00:13:58,025 --> 00:13:58,705
Xue Zhi.

205
00:14:00,025 --> 00:14:02,185
If you encounter something
truly terrifying

206
00:14:02,866 --> 00:14:04,266
but can't avoid it,

207
00:14:05,545 --> 00:14:06,506
what would you do?

208
00:14:06,945 --> 00:14:08,466
Something terrifying?

209
00:14:08,592 --> 00:14:10,656
I used to be very afraid
of chickens as a child,

210
00:14:10,785 --> 00:14:11,785
really afraid.

211
00:14:12,025 --> 00:14:13,509
One time, my mother got so angry

212
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,145
she threw me into the chicken coop.

213
00:14:15,305 --> 00:14:17,305
I struggled in there for half a day,

214
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:19,363
and eventually, I found it a bit funny.

215
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,721
After that, I was never afraid again.

216
00:14:23,746 --> 00:14:24,626
You're right.

217
00:14:25,825 --> 00:14:27,746
I can't let my fear

218
00:14:28,106 --> 00:14:29,346
throw me off balance.

219
00:14:31,665 --> 00:14:33,545
The past is already behind me.

220
00:14:34,185 --> 00:14:35,025
I have to face

221
00:14:35,586 --> 00:14:36,785
what's coming.

222
00:14:38,266 --> 00:14:38,905
Young Lady.

223
00:14:50,065 --> 00:14:51,905
Your Lordship, aside from Jimo House,

224
00:14:52,025 --> 00:14:53,785
we've searched the entire residence.

225
00:14:53,891 --> 00:14:56,386
I've ordered our men
to surround Jimo House.

226
00:15:25,825 --> 00:15:26,466
Marquis Lu.

227
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,700
Marquis Lu, we couldn't find anything.

228
00:15:56,146 --> 00:15:57,106
Do you know

229
00:15:58,346 --> 00:16:01,305
the penalty for harboring
a major criminal?

230
00:16:02,626 --> 00:16:05,106
It's the same as being guilty
of the crime.

231
00:16:05,905 --> 00:16:07,025
Hand him over,

232
00:16:09,305 --> 00:16:10,586
and I'll spare you.

233
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,340
Who do you want me to hand over?

234
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:14,908
Didn't you already search?

235
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:16,226
The Imperial Guards

236
00:16:16,227 --> 00:16:18,627
saw him climb into the Luo Residence.

237
00:16:19,648 --> 00:16:21,528
We've searched all the other courtyards.

238
00:16:21,986 --> 00:16:23,146
If he's not here,

239
00:16:23,545 --> 00:16:24,705
where else could he be?

240
00:16:26,705 --> 00:16:27,506
Who climbed in?

241
00:16:27,524 --> 00:16:28,563
Tell me honestly.

242
00:16:29,146 --> 00:16:29,866
I have no idea.

243
00:16:31,185 --> 00:16:33,065
There's no one else here, Marquis Lu.

244
00:16:33,584 --> 00:16:35,580
If you're bent on blaming me,
what's stopping you?

245
00:16:35,642 --> 00:16:37,043
If he really were here,

246
00:16:37,665 --> 00:16:38,905
a capable man like you

247
00:16:39,065 --> 00:16:41,938
would have already found him easily.

248
00:16:44,905 --> 00:16:45,986
How bold.

249
00:16:47,785 --> 00:16:49,705
You dare to defy me.

250
00:16:50,146 --> 00:16:52,146
Guards, take him away.

251
00:16:52,187 --> 00:16:52,706
Yes, sir.

252
00:16:53,866 --> 00:16:55,545
- You...
- Come on.

253
00:16:58,816 --> 00:17:00,880
Obstructing the Imperial Guards'
investigation,

254
00:17:01,138 --> 00:17:02,177
30 lashes.

255
00:17:02,192 --> 00:17:03,088
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

256
00:17:08,665 --> 00:17:09,346
Stop!

257
00:17:12,505 --> 00:17:13,225
Stop!

258
00:17:16,905 --> 00:17:17,945
Greetings, Marquis Lu.

259
00:17:19,106 --> 00:17:19,786
Seventh Lady,

260
00:17:20,465 --> 00:17:21,505
we meet again.

261
00:17:21,945 --> 00:17:23,346
Marquis Lu, capturing fugitives

262
00:17:23,425 --> 00:17:24,746
is your duty.

263
00:17:25,026 --> 00:17:26,705
Cooperating with the investigation

264
00:17:26,724 --> 00:17:27,964
is our obligation.

265
00:17:28,306 --> 00:17:30,425
However, you're beating a man

266
00:17:30,786 --> 00:17:31,985
without any evidence.

267
00:17:32,505 --> 00:17:33,905
Don't Imperial Guards need

268
00:17:34,265 --> 00:17:35,866
to follow the law?

269
00:17:37,425 --> 00:17:38,386
Do you know that

270
00:17:38,672 --> 00:17:40,720
obstructing the Imperial Guards'
investigation

271
00:17:40,786 --> 00:17:41,745
is punishable by death

272
00:17:42,346 --> 00:17:43,745
regardless of who you are?

273
00:17:44,386 --> 00:17:46,225
Judging by your eloquence,

274
00:17:46,665 --> 00:17:48,465
I take it you've recovered.

275
00:17:49,866 --> 00:17:52,225
Your voice

276
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:54,945
reminds me of someone I knew.

277
00:17:55,665 --> 00:17:56,786
You're the silly one.

278
00:17:57,106 --> 00:17:58,265
I've tied

279
00:17:58,465 --> 00:17:59,346
an extra knot here

280
00:17:59,465 --> 00:18:01,265
on purpose.

00:18:36,905 --> 00:18:39,386
I've never met you before.

292
00:18:39,616 --> 00:18:41,040
How could we have known each other?

293
00:18:45,106 --> 00:18:47,306
You accused my third brother
of harboring fugitives

294
00:18:47,866 --> 00:18:49,786
without any evidence.

295
00:18:50,386 --> 00:18:51,745

296
00:18:51,757 --> 00:18:52,917

What is this?

Do you always conduct
your investigations

based purely on intuition?

300
00:18:59,425 --> 00:19:00,306
How dare you!

301
00:19:02,826 --> 00:19:03,905
I don't need you

302
00:19:04,185 --> 00:19:05,665

Get out of the way.

321
00:20:30,985 --> 00:20:33,346
Marquis Lu, barging in at this hour.

322
00:20:33,626 --> 00:20:36,346
Are you trying to seize my residence?

323
00:20:37,626 --> 00:20:38,306
Old Madam Luo,

324
00:20:39,346 --> 00:20:40,505
I'm just carrying out

325
00:20:40,786 --> 00:20:42,866
my duty.

326
00:20:44,146 --> 00:20:45,586
I understand.

327
00:20:46,546 --> 00:20:47,665
Now that

328
00:20:47,866 --> 00:20:50,386
you've searched the entire residence

329
00:20:51,026 --> 00:20:53,265
including Jimo House,

330
00:20:53,346 --> 00:20:55,665
have you found the fugitive?

331
00:20:56,225 --> 00:20:57,066
Not yet.

332
00:20:57,225 --> 00:20:58,826
Not yet?

333
00:20:59,146 --> 00:21:01,331
Marquis, you and your men

334
00:21:01,332 --> 00:21:03,053
searched my entire residence,

335
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,856
yet found nothing.

336
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:09,586
You even gave my family member
a beating.

337
00:21:11,185 --> 00:21:12,106
Very well.

338
00:21:12,945 --> 00:21:14,225
Tomorrow,

339
00:21:14,586 --> 00:21:16,945
I will enter the palace
in my court dress

340
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,480
and demand an explanation.

341
00:21:19,185 --> 00:21:20,026
Old Madam Luo,

342
00:21:20,985 --> 00:21:22,146
are you

343
00:21:22,905 --> 00:21:24,225
threatening me?

344
00:21:27,106 --> 00:21:29,386
Our family has served the court
for three generations.

345
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,681
We've always fulfilled our duty

346
00:21:31,827 --> 00:21:32,988
unwaveringly.

347
00:21:33,185 --> 00:21:36,225
Though we have not achieved
anything impressive,

348
00:21:36,346 --> 00:21:38,985
we have earned our place
through hard work.

349
00:21:40,826 --> 00:21:43,866
Marquis, you have tarnished
our family's reputation

350
00:21:43,867 --> 00:21:46,667
with your unwarranted search.

351
00:21:47,146 --> 00:21:49,826
You even accused us

352
00:21:49,866 --> 00:21:51,306
of harboring criminals.

353
00:21:51,386 --> 00:21:53,705
A trumped-up charge
if I ever heard of one.

354
00:21:56,665 --> 00:21:59,106
We don't deserve this.

355
00:22:08,346 --> 00:22:12,905
Since our family has defied you...

356
00:22:18,465 --> 00:22:19,386
Very well.

357
00:22:20,026 --> 00:22:22,866
If you must punish someone,
let it be me.

358
00:22:23,344 --> 00:22:24,240
- Mother!
- Grandma!

359
00:22:24,243 --> 00:22:24,723
Old Madam!

360
00:22:24,945 --> 00:22:25,786
Grandma!

361
00:22:40,848 --> 00:22:42,780
There's no need to act like this,
Old Madam Luo.

362
00:22:43,546 --> 00:22:44,745
I'm only doing this

363
00:22:45,265 --> 00:22:46,265
for the safety

364
00:22:46,386 --> 00:22:47,866
of your family.

365
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,480
Since the criminal is not here,

366
00:22:50,826 --> 00:22:53,306
I will now continue the search

367
00:22:53,425 --> 00:22:54,745
elsewhere.

368
00:22:59,066 --> 00:22:59,786
Goodbye.

369
00:23:06,586 --> 00:23:07,386
Let's go.

370
00:23:18,265 --> 00:23:19,739
- Yining, quickly.
- Young Lady.

371
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,768
- Yining!
- Seventh Lady.

372
00:23:21,106 --> 00:23:22,066
Help her up, quickly.

373
00:23:22,099 --> 00:23:23,418
Young Master, are you alright?

374
00:23:25,826 --> 00:23:27,499
Take Yining back to her room, hurry.

375
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:27,960
Yes.

376
00:23:28,985 --> 00:23:29,626
Careful.

377
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:52,819
(Chengjing Hall)

378
00:24:02,346 --> 00:24:03,346
Investigate every

379
00:24:04,665 --> 00:24:06,945
detail of Seventh Lady's past.

380
00:24:07,705 --> 00:24:09,386
Leave nothing unchecked.

381
00:24:12,745 --> 00:24:13,465
Qing Qu,

382
00:24:13,745 --> 00:24:14,705
how is Third Brother?

383
00:24:14,736 --> 00:24:16,820
Don't worry, Young Lady.
His wounds have been treated.

384
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,128
He's being questioned by Old Madam

385
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:18,920
and Second Master.

386
00:24:19,905 --> 00:24:21,505
I must go see him.

387
00:24:21,866 --> 00:24:22,866
You can't, Young Lady.

388
00:24:23,026 --> 00:24:24,066
Old Madam instructed

389
00:24:24,067 --> 00:24:25,106
you to rest in your room.

390
00:24:25,265 --> 00:24:26,185
You mustn't go out.

391
00:24:26,306 --> 00:24:27,225
She's right.

392
00:24:27,226 --> 00:24:28,266
Take care of yourself first.

393
00:24:28,316 --> 00:24:29,477
You gave us quite the scare

394
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,841
when you rushed out today.

395
00:24:33,705 --> 00:24:34,386
Alright.

396
00:24:34,975 --> 00:24:35,856
Qing Qu,

397
00:24:36,106 --> 00:24:37,106
go check on him.

398
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:38,559
If anything happens to him,

399
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,800
come tell me immediately.

400
00:24:40,546 --> 00:24:41,346
Yes.

401
00:24:51,905 --> 00:24:53,146
What is really going on?

402
00:24:55,225 --> 00:24:56,306
I don't know either.

403
00:24:56,905 --> 00:24:57,665
You don't know?

404
00:24:57,945 --> 00:24:59,705
Why would Marquis Lu be after you?

405
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:01,586
I rarely leave the mansion.

406
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:03,328
How could I have provoked
someone like him?

407
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:04,505
Perhaps

408
00:25:06,066 --> 00:25:07,146
he was setting an example.

409
00:25:07,265 --> 00:25:09,265
Setting an example for whom?

410
00:25:10,425 --> 00:25:11,465
Our family

411
00:25:11,905 --> 00:25:13,265
has never offended him.

412
00:25:13,826 --> 00:25:14,905
I think you must have

413
00:25:15,786 --> 00:25:17,586
somehow offended Marquis Lu.

414
00:25:17,786 --> 00:25:19,826
You've nearly brought disaster upon us.

415
00:25:20,346 --> 00:25:21,225
Kneel!

416
00:25:34,106 --> 00:25:36,745
Marquis Lu is fierce by nature

417
00:25:36,866 --> 00:25:38,026
and unpredictable in his moods.

418
00:25:38,586 --> 00:25:40,225
From now on, everyone in this residence

419
00:25:40,665 --> 00:25:42,639
must keep him at a respectful distance

420
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:43,920
and not provoke him.

421
00:25:45,386 --> 00:25:48,546
Otherwise, I will show no mercy.

422
00:25:52,306 --> 00:25:54,465
Old Madam, Qing Qu is waiting outside.

423
00:25:57,745 --> 00:25:59,146
Let her in.

424
00:25:59,240 --> 00:25:59,879
Yes.

425
00:26:01,546 --> 00:26:02,306
Qing Qu.

426
00:26:09,106 --> 00:26:10,026
Old Madam.

427
00:26:10,705 --> 00:26:14,026
How is Yining's injury?

428
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:15,106
Old Madam,

429
00:26:15,346 --> 00:26:16,905
Seventh Lady is fine.

430
00:26:17,026 --> 00:26:18,626
She has been treated and is resting now.

431
00:26:18,905 --> 00:26:20,985
Please don't worry.

432
00:26:23,106 --> 00:26:24,386
Your lady

433
00:26:24,387 --> 00:26:26,508
sent you here to check
if there's any trouble,

434
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,340
didn't she?

435
00:26:31,945 --> 00:26:33,386
I'm tired.

436
00:26:36,066 --> 00:26:36,826
Mother,

437
00:26:38,465 --> 00:26:39,306
take it easy.

438
00:27:03,905 --> 00:27:04,786
Shao'an.

439
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,180
- Young Master.
- Go keep watch at the gate.

440
00:27:09,306 --> 00:27:10,386
Is your wound alright?

441
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,041
I can't worry about that now.

442
00:27:12,723 --> 00:27:13,202
Hurry.

443
00:27:13,539 --> 00:27:14,059
Yes.

444
00:27:45,444 --> 00:27:48,381
(In memory of our honored master
Chen Jiuheng)

445
00:27:52,106 --> 00:27:52,945
Senior.

446
00:27:58,146 --> 00:27:58,826
Yuan.

447
00:28:03,106 --> 00:28:04,665
Sorry, my recklessness today

448
00:28:04,692 --> 00:28:05,851
almost got you into trouble.

449
00:28:06,346 --> 00:28:07,905
How is Xia Yong and the others?

450
00:28:07,985 --> 00:28:08,626
They're fine.

451
00:28:09,705 --> 00:28:10,346
Senior,

452
00:28:11,425 --> 00:28:13,265
why did you risk your life to come back?

453
00:28:13,408 --> 00:28:14,700
Didn't I tell you in the letter...

454
00:28:14,755 --> 00:28:16,194
I'm tired of hiding.

455
00:28:17,562 --> 00:28:19,162
But it's too dangerous here.

456
00:28:19,705 --> 00:28:21,905
You're at the top of the wanted list.

457
00:28:22,026 --> 00:28:23,106
So what?

458
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,641
It's better than living in darkness.

459
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,840
As long as you're alive, there's hope.

460
00:28:28,626 --> 00:28:30,185
That's what Master used to say.

461
00:28:30,905 --> 00:28:33,146
Now, the Luo Residence
is under Lu Jiaxue's watch.

462
00:28:33,786 --> 00:28:34,346
Senior,

463
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,599
in the coming days,

464
00:28:36,816 --> 00:28:38,864
I'll arrange for you to leave
as soon as possible.

465
00:28:50,306 --> 00:28:50,826
Young Master,

466
00:28:51,985 --> 00:28:52,826
the Imperial Guards

467
00:28:52,835 --> 00:28:54,236
have surrounded the Luo Residence.

468
00:28:54,786 --> 00:28:55,626
As expected.

469
00:28:55,728 --> 00:28:57,380
Luckily, they didn't find
the hidden room.

470
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,848
Or we would not
have survived tonight.

471
00:28:59,705 --> 00:29:01,146
The priority now

472
00:29:01,786 --> 00:29:03,386
is to get Senior Daoyan out.

473
00:29:03,905 --> 00:29:05,626
Not just out of the Luo Residence,

474
00:29:05,626 --> 00:29:07,027
but as far away as possible.

475
00:29:07,626 --> 00:29:08,985
I know his temperament too well.

476
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:10,112
He'd rather break than bend.

477
00:29:10,346 --> 00:29:11,505
I fear he'll act impulsively

478
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:13,130
and do something foolish.

479
00:29:13,945 --> 00:29:14,546
Understood.

480
00:29:18,146 --> 00:29:18,705
Young Master,

481
00:29:19,586 --> 00:29:21,265
are you heading to Haitang Abode?

482
00:29:21,626 --> 00:29:22,705
Seventh Lady is injured.

483
00:29:22,706 --> 00:29:24,145
She must be resting by now.

484
00:29:26,465 --> 00:29:27,106
True.

485
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:29,705
I'll go see her tomorrow, then.

486
00:29:30,346 --> 00:29:31,265
This situation

487
00:29:32,185 --> 00:29:34,106
now involves not only the Luo family

488
00:29:35,546 --> 00:29:37,066
but has also caused Yining to suffer.

489
00:29:38,745 --> 00:29:40,386
It can't be helped.

490
00:29:42,665 --> 00:29:43,386
Shao'an,

491
00:29:44,265 --> 00:29:45,985
don't you think that
Lu Jiaxue's behavior

492
00:29:45,986 --> 00:29:47,666
towards Yining

493
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:50,306
is rather strange?

494
00:29:50,315 --> 00:29:51,395
I think

495
00:29:51,506 --> 00:29:53,628
it's you who has feelings
for Seventh Lady.

496
00:29:54,505 --> 00:29:56,506
You even risked exposing yourself

497
00:29:56,508 --> 00:29:57,348
to protect her.

498
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:02,745
Enough.

499
00:30:02,768 --> 00:30:04,730
I'll go get some food and supplies
for Senior Daoyan.

500
00:30:04,732 --> 00:30:05,932
Good. Go on.

501
00:30:26,066 --> 00:30:27,265
I was scared to death.

502
00:30:33,505 --> 00:30:34,786
Get out of the way.

503
00:30:35,106 --> 00:30:36,386
Stop hitting him!

504
00:30:41,586 --> 00:30:42,745
You're injured.

505
00:30:43,346 --> 00:30:44,745
Why aren't you resting?

506
00:30:46,586 --> 00:30:48,546
You still won't be honest with me?

507
00:30:49,417 --> 00:30:50,897
What exactly are you up to?

508
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:53,006
What is going on

509
00:30:53,306 --> 00:30:54,826
between you and Lu Jiaxue?

510
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,120
What's your history with him?

511
00:31:01,786 --> 00:31:02,505
Yining,

512
00:31:04,745 --> 00:31:06,146
I once told you

513
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,479
that my youth was spent in darkness.

514
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:11,239
But then a star appeared

515
00:31:11,505 --> 00:31:13,066
and lit my path.

516
00:31:13,866 --> 00:31:15,386
That person was my master,

517
00:31:16,425 --> 00:31:18,665
the former Minister of Revenue,
Chen Jiuheng.

518
00:31:19,026 --> 00:31:20,665
He taught me to read and write,

519
00:31:20,976 --> 00:31:22,456
helped me find a martial arts master,

520
00:31:22,705 --> 00:31:25,225
and taught me the ways of humanity.

521
00:31:25,745 --> 00:31:27,626
The man Lu Jiaxue is searching for

522
00:31:28,066 --> 00:31:29,185
is called Chen Daoyan.

523
00:31:29,745 --> 00:31:30,866
He is my senior

524
00:31:31,106 --> 00:31:32,465
and my master's adopted son.

525
00:31:32,705 --> 00:31:34,425
We grew up together.

526
00:31:35,066 --> 00:31:36,265
To me,

527
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:37,480
he is like an elder brother.

528
00:31:37,905 --> 00:31:39,905
So, what you mentioned before

529
00:31:40,066 --> 00:31:41,386
was indeed about your master.

530
00:31:52,626 --> 00:31:53,665
Unfortunately,

531
00:31:54,665 --> 00:31:56,505
he was too good for this world.

532
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:59,560
My master was slandered

533
00:31:59,985 --> 00:32:01,306
and ultimately

534
00:32:02,626 --> 00:32:04,346
betrayed and killed by scoundrels.

535
00:32:05,905 --> 00:32:06,945
And this incident

536
00:32:07,306 --> 00:32:08,705
is connected to Lu Jiaxue?

537
00:32:09,826 --> 00:32:10,346
Yes.

538
00:32:11,546 --> 00:32:13,185
As the Minister of Revenue,

539
00:32:13,745 --> 00:32:15,665
my master discovered corruption
in the court,

540
00:32:16,146 --> 00:32:17,546
only to be framed instead.

541
00:32:17,866 --> 00:32:19,265
My fellow disciples

542
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:22,306
either died or fled.

543
00:32:22,323 --> 00:32:23,484
All of them were implicated.

544
00:32:23,985 --> 00:32:27,306
We were like ghosts, shunned by society.

545
00:32:28,626 --> 00:32:29,705
Only I...

546
00:32:33,146 --> 00:32:35,386
Due to our family's status,

547
00:32:35,586 --> 00:32:37,225
my master taught me in secret,

548
00:32:37,786 --> 00:32:39,225
thus sparing me from the disaster.

549
00:32:39,826 --> 00:32:40,745
Lu Jiaxue

550
00:32:40,905 --> 00:32:42,826
is only the tip of the iceberg.

551
00:32:43,346 --> 00:32:45,026
No matter how perilous the road ahead,

552
00:32:47,225 --> 00:32:48,745
I will not rest

553
00:32:49,905 --> 00:32:51,985
until my master's name is cleared.

554
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,880
But I did not expect

555
00:32:55,703 --> 00:32:57,062
to implicate you

556
00:32:57,664 --> 00:32:59,303
and the Luo family.

557
00:33:09,386 --> 00:33:10,066
Third Brother,

558
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,840
thank you for telling me.

559
00:33:13,505 --> 00:33:14,505
Now I understand

560
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,360
how difficult your life has been.

561
00:33:16,866 --> 00:33:19,066
I won't doubt you again.

562
00:33:19,265 --> 00:33:20,225
You did the right thing.

563
00:33:20,546 --> 00:33:21,905
You owe him a great debt,

564
00:33:22,026 --> 00:33:23,425
so you should repay it

565
00:33:23,434 --> 00:33:24,674
and clear his name.

566
00:33:25,106 --> 00:33:27,786
That is what a true man should do.

567
00:33:28,386 --> 00:33:30,425
But what you're doing

568
00:33:30,546 --> 00:33:31,665
is dangerous.

569
00:33:31,866 --> 00:33:32,866
No matter what,

570
00:33:33,026 --> 00:33:34,465
please be cautious.

571
00:33:35,225 --> 00:33:35,866
Only then

572
00:33:36,346 --> 00:33:38,106
can I rest assured.

573
00:33:39,264 --> 00:33:40,024
In the future,

574
00:33:41,665 --> 00:33:43,985
don't behave recklessly
as you did tonight.

575
00:33:44,425 --> 00:33:46,866
As for Lu Jiaxue,

576
00:33:47,546 --> 00:33:48,905
be careful with him.

577
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,546
I am Seventh Lady of the Luo family.

578
00:33:50,784 --> 00:33:52,180
As long as he doesn't provoke me,

579
00:33:52,505 --> 00:33:54,786
why should I be bothered about him?

580
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:57,026
Besides, with you protecting me,

581
00:33:57,225 --> 00:33:58,146
I'm not afraid of him.

582
00:33:58,665 --> 00:33:59,386
Alright.

583
00:34:00,106 --> 00:34:01,826
I promise I will keep you safe.

584
00:34:02,265 --> 00:34:03,346
You

585
00:34:03,626 --> 00:34:04,465
should focus on

586
00:34:04,466 --> 00:34:05,506
joining the family register

587
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,720
and the imperial exams.

588
00:34:07,026 --> 00:34:08,466
Once you have joined the register,

589
00:34:08,705 --> 00:34:09,745
passed the exams

590
00:34:10,305 --> 00:34:12,066
and achieved your goals,

591
00:34:12,385 --> 00:34:14,506
- Grandma...
- As for Old Madam,

592
00:34:14,507 --> 00:34:15,586
I'll find a way.

593
00:34:32,877 --> 00:34:34,676
You've come voluntarily,

594
00:34:35,506 --> 00:34:37,305
I see.

595
00:34:37,665 --> 00:34:38,665
I know

596
00:34:39,466 --> 00:34:41,466
you must have many questions.

597
00:34:42,305 --> 00:34:43,705
Regarding last night,

598
00:34:44,825 --> 00:34:47,665
you might fool others, but not me.

599
00:34:48,164 --> 00:34:49,405
So tell me,

600
00:34:49,865 --> 00:34:52,466
why did Marquis Lu target you?

601
00:34:55,106 --> 00:34:57,345
Was the burnt corpse and the brocade box

602
00:34:58,026 --> 00:34:59,865
your doing?

603
00:35:00,906 --> 00:35:01,466
Yes.

604
00:35:01,825 --> 00:35:03,586
Why did you do it?

605
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,440
Only by letting Ye Yan see
with his own eyes

606
00:35:05,546 --> 00:35:07,146
that Li Yinglong died in the fire

607
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:08,432
trying to seize the testimony,

608
00:35:08,466 --> 00:35:10,426
would he stop focusing
on the Luo Residence.

609
00:35:11,146 --> 00:35:13,466
How did you capture Li Yinglong?

610
00:35:13,665 --> 00:35:15,146
Old Madam, do you know him?

611
00:35:18,265 --> 00:35:20,146
I've been monitoring
the coastal area for years,

612
00:35:20,506 --> 00:35:21,705
guiding the authorities

613
00:35:21,706 --> 00:35:23,427
to raid his warehouses.

614
00:35:23,437 --> 00:35:24,741
I turned him into a wanted man,

615
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,001
then helped him escape,

616
00:35:26,106 --> 00:35:27,305
leading him to the capital

617
00:35:27,785 --> 00:35:29,345
to seek protection from his backer.

618
00:35:29,745 --> 00:35:32,106
What is your connection to Chen Jiuheng?

619
00:35:32,626 --> 00:35:34,225
Do you remember

620
00:35:34,345 --> 00:35:36,385
when the family hired tutors

621
00:35:36,546 --> 00:35:37,665
to establish a private academy

622
00:35:37,825 --> 00:35:39,106
for Xuanyuan and Shanyuan?

623
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:40,265
Yes, I remember.

624
00:35:40,426 --> 00:35:42,785
You wanted to join
the Luo Residence's academy

625
00:35:42,865 --> 00:35:44,265
to study and learn,

626
00:35:44,586 --> 00:35:46,906
but were beaten by Second Master

627
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,520
and ran away.

628
00:35:49,066 --> 00:35:49,665
Yes.

629
00:35:50,665 --> 00:35:51,705
It was then

630
00:35:52,146 --> 00:35:53,265
that I met my master.

631
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,561
He was a second father to me.

632
00:35:57,946 --> 00:35:59,026
I never thought

633
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:02,066
you'd have such a chance encounter.

634
00:36:06,785 --> 00:36:07,626
So,

635
00:36:08,106 --> 00:36:10,185
you've been staying here

636
00:36:10,874 --> 00:36:12,994
just for that testimony?

637
00:36:13,426 --> 00:36:14,825
And for two debts of gratitude.

638
00:36:16,385 --> 00:36:17,819
Madam Gu saved my mother

639
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,120
when she was pregnant with me.

640
00:36:19,225 --> 00:36:20,586
I owe her my life.

641
00:36:20,745 --> 00:36:22,466
Old Master preserved the testimony

642
00:36:22,586 --> 00:36:23,825
in hopes that one day,

643
00:36:23,867 --> 00:36:25,746
my master would be vindicated.

644
00:36:26,265 --> 00:36:27,265
I'm willing to repay

645
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:29,980
these two debts of gratitude
with my life.

646
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:36,279
Alright, you may leave now.

647
00:36:51,705 --> 00:36:53,546
Why are you still standing there?

648
00:36:53,865 --> 00:36:55,185
Revealing the truth of the case

649
00:36:56,426 --> 00:36:57,426
was the Old Master's

650
00:36:57,427 --> 00:36:58,827
last wish, wasn't it?

651
00:37:01,466 --> 00:37:03,066
You want the testimony?

652
00:37:03,345 --> 00:37:05,146
Before you can even
submit the testimony,

653
00:37:05,147 --> 00:37:06,308
you'd have been killed

654
00:37:06,311 --> 00:37:07,470
and brought devastation

655
00:37:07,762 --> 00:37:09,563
to the Luo family.

656
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:10,571
I promise

657
00:37:12,066 --> 00:37:14,026
not to implicate the Luo family.

658
00:37:16,946 --> 00:37:18,466
How are you going to guarantee that?

659
00:37:18,546 --> 00:37:20,865
I'll show you that I'm capable
of overturning the case.

660
00:37:21,426 --> 00:37:22,345
I'll give it my all

661
00:37:22,705 --> 00:37:24,506
in the imperial exam.

662
00:37:24,507 --> 00:37:25,347
If I succeed,

663
00:37:25,754 --> 00:37:27,754
please trust me

664
00:37:29,066 --> 00:37:30,466
and give me the testimony.

665
00:37:35,705 --> 00:37:38,185
You speak with confidence.

666
00:37:38,265 --> 00:37:39,506
Then let me ask you,

667
00:37:40,066 --> 00:37:42,665
under what status
will you take the exam?

668
00:37:42,971 --> 00:37:44,330
The Second Master still

669
00:37:44,389 --> 00:37:46,789
hasn't acknowledged your identity.

670
00:37:49,586 --> 00:37:51,825
Then under what status do you wish

671
00:37:52,185 --> 00:37:53,345
I take the exam?

672
00:37:57,026 --> 00:37:58,466
Young Master, you're back.

673
00:37:59,745 --> 00:38:00,426
What did she say?

674
00:38:00,865 --> 00:38:01,546
I laid it all out.

675
00:38:02,305 --> 00:38:03,345
You told her everything?

676
00:38:03,705 --> 00:38:04,986
She didn't throw you out?

677
00:38:05,586 --> 00:38:07,506
She's kept that testimony for years.

678
00:38:07,946 --> 00:38:10,026
It shows she knows right from wrong.

679
00:38:10,265 --> 00:38:11,705
Did she give you the testimony?

680
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:12,521
No.

681
00:38:13,705 --> 00:38:15,026
She's waiting for someone

682
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:16,546
capable of fulfilling

683
00:38:16,547 --> 00:38:18,227
the Old Master's last wish.

684
00:38:18,785 --> 00:38:20,106
I've promised her

685
00:38:20,426 --> 00:38:21,906
to give my all in the exams.

686
00:38:22,745 --> 00:38:24,185
With your talents,

687
00:38:24,305 --> 00:38:25,986
acing the exam is a sure thing.

688
00:38:26,106 --> 00:38:27,185
Don't try to flatter me.

689
00:38:27,426 --> 00:38:28,185
But,

690
00:38:28,218 --> 00:38:29,778
if you take the exam as a member

691
00:38:29,792 --> 00:38:30,705
of the Luo family,

692
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,120
Second Master might...

693
00:38:33,305 --> 00:38:34,626
I've already thought of a way.

694
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:35,799
By the way,

695
00:38:37,146 --> 00:38:38,865
here's a record
of Mr. Sun's whereabouts,

696
00:38:39,026 --> 00:38:39,785
as you requested.

697
00:38:40,672 --> 00:38:41,600
(Morning: Imperial City)
Mr. Sun Jie

698
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,114
(Afternoon: Academy; Evening: Teahouse)
is a revered scholar

699
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,460
and a well-respected imperial tutor.

700
00:38:44,466 --> 00:38:46,345
Why are you looking into him?

701
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:48,825
Whether I can succeed in the exam

702
00:38:49,106 --> 00:38:51,385
and safely escort Senior Daoyan
out of the residence

703
00:38:51,705 --> 00:38:54,705
all depends on this gentleman.

704
00:38:55,506 --> 00:38:57,225
Qing Qu, the letter to Ms. Zheng

705
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,416
should have arrived by now, huh?

706
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,360
Don't worry, Young Lady.

707
00:38:59,408 --> 00:39:01,008
We'll hear back
in the next couple of days.

708
00:39:01,066 --> 00:39:01,825
Mother,

709
00:39:01,986 --> 00:39:03,146
your foot is injured.

710
00:39:03,155 --> 00:39:04,195
Don't run around like this.

711
00:39:04,426 --> 00:39:05,586
My foot's fine.

712
00:39:05,785 --> 00:39:06,979
You played the hero

713
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:08,700
and took the punishment
for your third brother.

714
00:39:08,706 --> 00:39:10,067
I had to come check on you.

715
00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:11,439
Rui Xiang,

716
00:39:11,546 --> 00:39:13,026
bring all the items in.

717
00:39:13,305 --> 00:39:13,946
Yes.

718
00:39:14,345 --> 00:39:15,986
You brought me so many things.

719
00:39:16,506 --> 00:39:18,066
Mother, are you moving

720
00:39:18,067 --> 00:39:19,027
the entire house here?

721
00:39:19,266 --> 00:39:21,799
You've been constantly getting sick

722
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,945
and getting hurt. Your body

723
00:39:23,946 --> 00:39:25,305
needs some serious nourishment.

724
00:39:25,665 --> 00:39:27,626
By the way, how is Shenyuan?

725
00:39:28,185 --> 00:39:30,466
That incident the other night
gave me such a fright.

726
00:39:31,106 --> 00:39:32,360
He suffered

727
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:33,970
an unexpected disaster.

728
00:39:34,146 --> 00:39:34,785
I'll have to go

729
00:39:34,906 --> 00:39:36,506
check on him myself.

730
00:39:36,906 --> 00:39:39,825
Mother, you're getting more and more
concerned about Third Brother.

731
00:39:41,665 --> 00:39:43,865
Well, he saved us that night
at the estate.

732
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:45,620
If not for him,
we could've lost our lives.

733
00:39:45,674 --> 00:39:48,075
Our hearts are made of flesh after all.

734
00:39:48,626 --> 00:39:50,265
Besides,

735
00:39:50,665 --> 00:39:52,745
he's had a tough life.

736
00:39:53,466 --> 00:39:55,385
If Third Brother knew how you felt,

737
00:39:55,586 --> 00:39:57,185
he'd be so moved.

738
00:39:58,865 --> 00:39:59,586
Mother,

739
00:39:59,705 --> 00:40:01,546
I want to discuss something with you.

740
00:40:01,745 --> 00:40:02,385
Go ahead.

741
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,670
I'd like Third Brother to be included
in the family register.

742
00:40:04,688 --> 00:40:06,780
Then he could take the imperial exams

743
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,032
as a member of the Luo family.

744
00:40:09,345 --> 00:40:10,745
I'm afraid

745
00:40:11,665 --> 00:40:13,626
your father wouldn't agree to that.

746
00:40:14,026 --> 00:40:17,026
But what if Third Brother

747
00:40:17,146 --> 00:40:18,705
could bring fame to the Luo family?

748
00:40:18,865 --> 00:40:20,066
You mean...

749
00:40:20,705 --> 00:40:22,026
Fame, prestige

750
00:40:22,067 --> 00:40:23,067
and the family's future,

751
00:40:23,345 --> 00:40:25,665
aren't those the things that matter
to Father the most?

752
00:40:26,426 --> 00:40:27,986
If we had a renowned scholar

753
00:40:28,058 --> 00:40:29,257
or tutor's endorsement,

754
00:40:29,466 --> 00:40:31,345
perhaps your father would be persuaded.

755
00:40:32,026 --> 00:40:33,146
Madam Chen has been

756
00:40:33,155 --> 00:40:36,146
looking for a tutor for Shan lately.

757
00:40:36,825 --> 00:40:38,066
A tutor?

758
00:40:38,745 --> 00:40:39,946
A renowned scholar?

759
00:40:41,546 --> 00:40:43,106
This might work.

760
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:46,225
Doesn't the Luo family hold
a Literary Feast every year?

761
00:40:47,305 --> 00:40:49,106
Those were the good old days,

762
00:40:49,265 --> 00:40:51,785
back when the Luos were still
a prominent family.

763
00:40:52,066 --> 00:40:53,426
Back then, famous scholars

764
00:40:53,427 --> 00:40:55,946
from all over the capital
would attend the Literary Feast.

765
00:40:56,146 --> 00:40:57,146
Now,

766
00:40:58,066 --> 00:40:59,345
I'm afraid not.

767
00:41:00,026 --> 00:41:02,426
But I remember Mr. Sun

768
00:41:02,546 --> 00:41:04,185
was a close friend of Grandpa's.

769
00:41:04,345 --> 00:41:05,745
If Grandma stepped in

770
00:41:05,763 --> 00:41:07,283
and invited him over,

771
00:41:07,546 --> 00:41:08,506
perhaps

772
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:10,186
other scholars

773
00:41:10,385 --> 00:41:11,546
would follow suit.

774
00:41:12,066 --> 00:41:13,305
In that case,

775
00:41:13,705 --> 00:41:15,426
if we could pull off the Literary Feast,

776
00:41:15,546 --> 00:41:17,639
it could only benefit

777
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,921
our family.

778
00:41:20,185 --> 00:41:21,026
I'll think about it.

779
00:41:26,665 --> 00:41:27,466
Mother,

780
00:41:28,146 --> 00:41:30,426
I heard our family

781
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:32,865
used to hold an annual feast

782
00:41:33,586 --> 00:41:36,305
where young talents from the capital
would gather,

783
00:41:36,426 --> 00:41:39,185
and many renowned scholars
would critique literary works.

784
00:41:39,586 --> 00:41:41,546
Our family must have been quite proud.

785
00:41:45,225 --> 00:41:48,305
But, as with all flowers,
they eventually wither.

786
00:41:48,546 --> 00:41:51,665
There's no such thing
as eternal prosperity in this world.

787
00:41:52,281 --> 00:41:55,626
And now, your father is no longer here.

788
00:41:56,106 --> 00:41:58,146
Chengwen has been posted away,

789
00:41:58,225 --> 00:41:59,305
and Chengzhang,

790
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:01,722
despite his efforts,
has not yet been promoted.

791
00:42:02,216 --> 00:42:05,775
The Luo family's glory days

792
00:42:06,665 --> 00:42:08,705
are far behind us.

793
00:42:08,825 --> 00:42:10,906
Even so, Mother,

794
00:42:11,345 --> 00:42:12,705
our century-old scholarly heritage

795
00:42:12,722 --> 00:42:14,802
is still alive,

796
00:42:15,026 --> 00:42:17,546
and Old Master's old friends
are still with us.

797
00:42:17,825 --> 00:42:20,345
We should stir things up
and revive our prestige.

798
00:42:20,506 --> 00:42:22,146
If one of our young men

799
00:42:22,147 --> 00:42:24,107
were to win the top prize
at the Literary Feast,

800
00:42:24,345 --> 00:42:25,825
it might just restore

801
00:42:25,837 --> 00:42:27,517
our family's glory.

802
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:30,225
But what if

803
00:42:30,466 --> 00:42:32,305
we don't win the top prize?

804
00:42:32,906 --> 00:42:35,265
Then we still lose nothing.

805
00:42:35,546 --> 00:42:36,185
Look,

806
00:42:36,426 --> 00:42:37,345
our young men

807
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:39,065
are of age to take the imperial exams,

808
00:42:39,426 --> 00:42:41,745
and our young ladies
of age to meet suitors.

809
00:42:41,792 --> 00:42:44,110
Getting acquainted with talented
young men from the capital

810
00:42:44,146 --> 00:42:45,546
is certainly a good thing.

811
00:42:46,466 --> 00:42:48,665
It may seem like a good plan,

812
00:42:49,345 --> 00:42:52,345
but given the current state
of the Luo family,

813
00:42:52,466 --> 00:42:53,385
do you think

814
00:42:53,586 --> 00:42:56,466
any renowned scholar
would agree to come?

815
00:42:56,493 --> 00:42:57,212
Mr. Sun.

816
00:43:00,345 --> 00:43:01,785
Who are you referring to?

817
00:43:03,026 --> 00:43:04,305
Mr. Sun.

818
00:43:05,265 --> 00:43:06,665
Mr. Sun.

819
00:43:07,305 --> 00:43:11,600
Hairu, you've thought this through
very carefully.

820
00:43:12,066 --> 00:43:13,146
You

821
00:43:13,825 --> 00:43:15,865
had this all planned out, didn't you?

822
00:43:18,946 --> 00:43:19,546
I…

823
00:43:20,385 --> 00:43:21,305
I just…

824
00:43:22,582 --> 00:43:24,343
I just heard that

825
00:43:25,305 --> 00:43:28,305
Mr. Sun and Old Master were very close.

826
00:43:28,466 --> 00:43:30,385
He was once an imperial tutor,

827
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,680
so he has the connections
and the reputation.

828
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:36,479
If you could step in and invite him,

829
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,508
the rest can be handled by me.

830
00:43:39,745 --> 00:43:41,785
And we can also use this chance

831
00:43:41,796 --> 00:43:43,155
to find a good match

832
00:43:44,185 --> 00:43:45,426
for Yining.

833
00:43:48,106 --> 00:43:50,715
Let me think about it.

834
00:43:52,466 --> 00:43:52,986
Sure.

835
00:43:53,466 --> 00:43:54,106
Then

836
00:43:54,586 --> 00:43:56,026
