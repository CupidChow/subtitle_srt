=The Rise of Ning=

00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,320
(Adapted from Wen Tan's novel "Chancellor
Training Handbook" from Jinjiang Literature)

3
00:01:36,556 --> 00:01:38,798
=Episode 2=

4
00:01:45,588 --> 00:01:46,148
Grandma.

5
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,679
Careful.

6
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:49,428
You were kneeling here all night.

7
00:01:49,547 --> 00:01:51,148
Are your knees hurting?

8
00:01:51,385 --> 00:01:52,424
My knees are fine.

9
00:01:52,547 --> 00:01:54,028
But I slept in my arms. They are numb.

10
00:01:54,228 --> 00:01:55,868
Grandma, I'm not silly.

11
00:01:55,987 --> 00:01:58,093
I slept on a bulrush cushion.

12
00:01:59,337 --> 00:02:00,576
Clever girl.

13
00:02:01,428 --> 00:02:02,228
Grandma,

14
00:02:03,335 --> 00:02:05,593
he was punished because of me.

15
00:02:05,788 --> 00:02:07,508
He knelt the entire night.

16
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,600
Could you please spare him?

17
00:02:12,952 --> 00:02:13,952
Get up.

18
00:02:14,565 --> 00:02:15,845
You should go back.

19
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:22,608
Thank you, Old Madam.

20
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:25,682
Thank you, Grandma. Let's go.

21
00:02:30,881 --> 00:02:31,842
Grandma,

22
00:02:32,562 --> 00:02:33,481
um...

23
00:02:33,921 --> 00:02:36,442
Who was that person kneeling with me?

24
00:02:38,257 --> 00:02:40,817
That was your third brother,
Luo Shenyuan.

25
00:02:40,914 --> 00:02:41,713
Third brother?

26
00:02:49,881 --> 00:02:51,642
- Grandma.
- I'm fine.

27
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:55,014
Grandma,

28
00:02:55,722 --> 00:02:57,562
he's also Father's child,

29
00:02:58,002 --> 00:02:59,162
but why does Father

30
00:02:59,202 --> 00:03:01,802
treat him coldly?

31
00:03:02,481 --> 00:03:03,562
Well,

32
00:03:03,587 --> 00:03:04,826
it has been a heavy burden

33
00:03:05,282 --> 00:03:07,361
weighing on your father's mind

34
00:03:07,402 --> 00:03:09,923
over the past years.

35
00:03:10,641 --> 00:03:11,601
Back then,

36
00:03:12,009 --> 00:03:13,930
Luo Shenyuan's birth mother

37
00:03:14,201 --> 00:03:15,522
was merely a maidservant

38
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:18,562
who cleaned chamber pots
outside the residence.

39
00:03:19,801 --> 00:03:20,722
One day,

40
00:03:20,922 --> 00:03:22,561
when your father got drunk,

41
00:03:23,422 --> 00:03:25,783
she bribed a servant,

42
00:03:26,242 --> 00:03:28,162
and then she was pregnant
with your third brother.

43
00:03:30,881 --> 00:03:33,842
Why didn't he call you Grandma?

44
00:03:35,162 --> 00:03:37,601
Your father dislikes

45
00:03:37,682 --> 00:03:39,162
the maidservant very much.

46
00:03:39,242 --> 00:03:41,041
He never even looked

47
00:03:41,162 --> 00:03:42,801
at her child.

48
00:03:43,162 --> 00:03:45,282
If it weren't for me fighting
to keep the child,

49
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:47,282
your father would've sent him

50
00:03:47,307 --> 00:03:48,908
to another place.

51
00:03:49,488 --> 00:03:51,510
To maintain the reputation
of the Luo's Residence,

52
00:03:51,542 --> 00:03:54,502
your father acknowledged him,

53
00:03:54,704 --> 00:03:56,760
but his name wouldn't be added
to the family register.

54
00:03:56,768 --> 00:03:59,820
That's why
he doesn't call me Grandma.

55
00:04:00,321 --> 00:04:01,722
This boy

56
00:04:02,962 --> 00:04:05,761
has been reticent since he was a kid.

57
00:04:06,081 --> 00:04:07,801
He never made a squeak,

58
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:09,074
even if someone bullied him.

59
00:04:09,161 --> 00:04:12,922
It makes me wonder

60
00:04:13,415 --> 00:04:15,935
if he's hiding something.

61
00:04:16,407 --> 00:04:19,113
I tried, but I couldn't
get close to him.

62
00:04:21,121 --> 00:04:23,241
This is like what people say,

63
00:04:23,842 --> 00:04:25,481
"the familial bond isn't deep."

64
00:04:31,162 --> 00:04:32,227
Grandma,

65
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,312
what is this place?

66
00:04:34,481 --> 00:04:35,241
Look over there.

67
00:04:36,202 --> 00:04:37,402
Begonia flowers.

68
00:04:38,561 --> 00:04:40,322
This was

69
00:04:40,347 --> 00:04:42,066
your mother's favorite flower.

70
00:04:44,082 --> 00:04:45,121
Look over here.

71
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:47,456
That's where Haitang Abode
[*Begonia in Chinese pronunciation]

72
00:04:47,921 --> 00:04:49,762
gets its name.

73
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,640
(Haitang Abode)

74
00:04:55,202 --> 00:04:56,361
Yining,

75
00:04:57,842 --> 00:04:59,681
you have grown

76
00:04:59,706 --> 00:05:01,665
into a young lady,

77
00:05:02,271 --> 00:05:04,591
intelligent and kind.

78
00:05:05,001 --> 00:05:07,762
I summoned you back

79
00:05:07,962 --> 00:05:09,001
for the marriage pact

80
00:05:09,026 --> 00:05:11,185
between the Luo and Jiang Families.

81
00:05:12,402 --> 00:05:15,441
Grandma, I understand what you mean.

82
00:05:16,361 --> 00:05:17,402
But

83
00:05:17,427 --> 00:05:18,826
I noticed

84
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:20,339
that Madam Jiang

85
00:05:20,514 --> 00:05:22,074
isn't satisfied with our family.

86
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:23,402
Besides,

87
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,089
I'm not in a hurry to get married.

88
00:05:27,001 --> 00:05:29,430
Don't be childish.

89
00:05:29,507 --> 00:05:30,748
A woman's fate

90
00:05:30,921 --> 00:05:32,121
depends on her husband,

91
00:05:32,146 --> 00:05:33,747
after all.

92
00:05:34,322 --> 00:05:35,241
Ning,

93
00:05:35,322 --> 00:05:37,241
look at me.

94
00:05:38,001 --> 00:05:41,241
Grizzled hair and tottering.

95
00:05:41,681 --> 00:05:43,321
Maybe someday

96
00:05:43,347 --> 00:05:44,667
I might just drop dead...

97
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:45,970
Grandma.

98
00:05:47,162 --> 00:05:49,522
If I'm gone,

99
00:05:49,801 --> 00:05:51,601
who will plan for your future?

100
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:53,550
Who will find a better marriage for you

101
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,080
than the Jiang Family?

102
00:05:58,162 --> 00:05:59,681
Grandma, that's nonsense.

103
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,241
Grandma,

104
00:06:02,842 --> 00:06:03,962
I know

105
00:06:04,058 --> 00:06:05,459
you are doing this for my own good.

106
00:06:06,082 --> 00:06:08,522
But, aside from marriage,

107
00:06:08,561 --> 00:06:10,282
there are other things
women can commit to.

108
00:06:10,307 --> 00:06:12,187
I want to travel around

109
00:06:12,377 --> 00:06:14,057
like Grandpa did

110
00:06:14,241 --> 00:06:15,441
and spend more time

111
00:06:15,466 --> 00:06:16,747
to stay with you.

112
00:06:18,472 --> 00:06:20,353
Your temper

113
00:06:20,378 --> 00:06:22,178
is very much like your Grandpa's.

114
00:06:22,522 --> 00:06:24,241
But I would want you

115
00:06:24,561 --> 00:06:27,642
to stay with me for a few more years.

116
00:06:28,277 --> 00:06:29,756
Let's not go back

117
00:06:30,162 --> 00:06:32,041
to the side yard again, yes?

118
00:06:32,722 --> 00:06:35,001
Just stay here to keep me company.

119
00:06:36,402 --> 00:06:37,601
Grandma,

120
00:06:37,962 --> 00:06:39,561
I can still spend time with you

121
00:06:39,586 --> 00:06:40,747
even if I don't stay here.

122
00:06:40,962 --> 00:06:43,050
You can visit me in the side yard,

123
00:06:43,202 --> 00:06:45,322
or I can come back here to see you,

124
00:06:45,498 --> 00:06:46,017
right?

125
00:06:53,561 --> 00:06:54,762
I know

126
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:59,121
you don't like this place.

127
00:07:00,162 --> 00:07:01,441
That's why you have stayed

128
00:07:01,466 --> 00:07:02,693
in the side yard for years

129
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,001
and refused to come back.

130
00:07:04,481 --> 00:07:07,322
You were young back then.

131
00:07:08,029 --> 00:07:09,287
I was worried Mistress Qiao

132
00:07:09,312 --> 00:07:10,951
might misteach you.

133
00:07:11,522 --> 00:07:13,801
I had no choice

134
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:17,055
but to send you to the side yard.

135
00:07:17,762 --> 00:07:18,642
I...

136
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,200
I really wish

137
00:07:21,601 --> 00:07:24,121
you could come back.

138
00:07:25,017 --> 00:07:25,698
Grandma.

139
00:07:26,384 --> 00:07:28,080
- Grandma, what's wrong?
- Old Madam.

140
00:07:28,402 --> 00:07:29,681
Here, take the medicine.

141
00:07:30,041 --> 00:07:31,681
- Please stay.
- Give me your hand.

142
00:07:31,722 --> 00:07:32,722
Here, Grandma.

143
00:07:33,162 --> 00:07:34,202
Take the medicine.

144
00:07:39,024 --> 00:07:40,200
Are you feeling any better?

145
00:07:40,529 --> 00:07:42,209
Ning. Yining, dear.

146
00:07:42,481 --> 00:07:44,041
Please stay here with me.

147
00:07:45,553 --> 00:07:47,914
Stay beside me, all right?

148
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,080
(Jimo House)

149
00:08:00,241 --> 00:08:02,393
Not that serious. I'm used to it.

150
00:08:02,418 --> 00:08:03,099
Leave it here.

151
00:08:07,001 --> 00:08:07,642
Young Master,

152
00:08:07,882 --> 00:08:10,026
why did you warn the Seventh Lady

153
00:08:10,361 --> 00:08:11,921
and get yourself punished?

154
00:08:12,082 --> 00:08:14,041
Did you forget how she once forced you

155
00:08:14,066 --> 00:08:15,066
to pluck fruits for her,

156
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,599
and you fell from the tree,

157
00:08:16,714 --> 00:08:18,435
injuring your dominant hand?

158
00:08:19,282 --> 00:08:20,361
There's no need

159
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:22,681
- to rake up the past.
- You forgive her

160
00:08:22,778 --> 00:08:23,921
because you are kind.

161
00:08:24,298 --> 00:08:26,481
But do you really see her
as your sister?

162
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:32,399
The people in the residence

163
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:33,882
have no relation to me.

164
00:08:34,441 --> 00:08:35,721
They are nothing but strangers.

165
00:08:35,961 --> 00:08:38,002
If so, I'm even more confused.

166
00:08:39,882 --> 00:08:41,642
After Old Master Luo's passing,

167
00:08:42,122 --> 00:08:43,522
we spent years

168
00:08:43,841 --> 00:08:46,081
searching through his paintings

169
00:08:46,201 --> 00:08:48,402
for the statement, but to no avail.

170
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:51,602
It's because we missed some.

171
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:54,393
Old Madam sent those paintings

172
00:08:54,418 --> 00:08:55,617
to the side yard

173
00:08:56,162 --> 00:08:57,282
for Luo Yining.

174
00:08:58,041 --> 00:09:00,242
Young Master, are you suggesting

175
00:09:00,267 --> 00:09:01,307
that the statement might be

176
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:03,104
among the paintings
in Luo Yining's possession?

177
00:09:05,921 --> 00:09:06,801
Ms. Xu,

178
00:09:07,362 --> 00:09:08,681
please tell me honestly.

179
00:09:09,002 --> 00:09:10,081
What's going on

180
00:09:10,106 --> 00:09:11,385
with Grandma's health?

181
00:09:15,002 --> 00:09:16,081
Seventh Lady,

182
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:17,919
Old Madam has been suffering

183
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,320
from a heart condition for many years.

184
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:21,409
She has been relying on medication.

185
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:23,451
Ever since you were sent
to the side yard,

186
00:09:23,841 --> 00:09:25,441
she feels guilty

187
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:27,250
whenever she thinks of you.

188
00:09:27,547 --> 00:09:29,575
On top of that, Mistress Qiao

189
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,241
always causes trouble,

190
00:09:32,242 --> 00:09:34,002
which annoys her more.

191
00:09:34,068 --> 00:09:36,268
Therefore, her heart condition worsens.

192
00:09:38,921 --> 00:09:41,041
I was too thoughtless

193
00:09:41,362 --> 00:09:42,961
and made Grandma worry.

194
00:09:43,066 --> 00:09:45,066
Seventh Lady, please don't say that.

195
00:09:46,201 --> 00:09:48,355
What did the physician say
about her condition?

196
00:09:49,002 --> 00:09:50,982
The heart condition
can't fully be cured.

197
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,256
It can only be treated with care.

198
00:09:52,272 --> 00:09:54,080
She'll be fine
as long as she's not agitated.

199
00:09:54,106 --> 00:09:55,385
But once she gets agitated,

200
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:57,410
her condition worsens
every time it acts up.

201
00:09:59,522 --> 00:10:02,321
Old Madam wishes you to stay.

202
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:03,242
Perhaps...

203
00:10:04,681 --> 00:10:06,002
Perhaps she's afraid

204
00:10:06,043 --> 00:10:07,563
that she might...

205
00:10:07,921 --> 00:10:10,282
Ms. Xu, don't say that.

206
00:10:11,201 --> 00:10:13,162
I was young back then,

207
00:10:13,234 --> 00:10:15,139
and Grandma always protected me.

208
00:10:15,801 --> 00:10:17,402
Now that I have grown,

209
00:10:17,522 --> 00:10:20,267
it's my turn to protect her.

210
00:10:23,602 --> 00:10:24,921
If Old Madam knew

211
00:10:24,993 --> 00:10:26,714
what you said,

212
00:10:27,008 --> 00:10:28,648
she would surely be glad.

213
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,320
I will send some servants

214
00:10:30,443 --> 00:10:33,078
to the side yard
to move all your things back.

215
00:10:33,561 --> 00:10:35,081
Thank you, Ms. Xu.

216
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:44,911
That's not right, Lian.

217
00:10:45,242 --> 00:10:46,441
Hold on.

218
00:10:46,721 --> 00:10:47,882
I have told you

219
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,430
that pressing is an important technique
when making incense trails.

220
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:52,242
If you press too hard or too lightly,

221
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,504
the incense won't burn properly.

222
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,330
Why can't you remember?

223
00:10:55,602 --> 00:10:56,602
Mother,

224
00:10:56,641 --> 00:10:59,036
why do you still want me
to learn the incense lore?

225
00:10:59,282 --> 00:11:01,201
My face was nearly burned.

226
00:11:01,362 --> 00:11:03,584
The marriage pact with the Jiang Family
is hopeless, too.

227
00:11:04,242 --> 00:11:05,561
Why has everything changed

228
00:11:05,595 --> 00:11:06,715
since Luo Yining returned?

229
00:11:07,762 --> 00:11:09,522
A provincial girl

230
00:11:09,547 --> 00:11:11,027
is enough to rattle your nerves?

231
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,280
I have put so much effort
into everything,

232
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,823
especially

233
00:11:14,848 --> 00:11:16,448
with Mr. Jiang.

234
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,839
Is Luo Yining going to reap what I sow?

235
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:20,443
She is the legitimate daughter,

236
00:11:20,468 --> 00:11:21,667
and Grandma backs her up.

237
00:11:21,776 --> 00:11:23,240
If she marries into the Jiang Family,

238
00:11:23,266 --> 00:11:24,585
she will completely overshadow me.

239
00:11:24,882 --> 00:11:26,321
You still haven't learned

240
00:11:26,346 --> 00:11:28,067
after all these years.

241
00:11:28,132 --> 00:11:29,732
Don't poke your nose into this.

242
00:11:29,908 --> 00:11:31,627
Just mind your own business.

243
00:11:31,841 --> 00:11:32,921
Stay out

244
00:11:33,002 --> 00:11:34,466
of Luo Yining's affairs.

245
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,159
Mistress Qiao, Fifth Lady.

246
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:37,960
Have you gathered any news about that?

247
00:11:37,986 --> 00:11:38,547
Yes.

248
00:11:38,817 --> 00:11:39,897
Recently, Madam Jiang

249
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,000
has been close to the princess

250
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,680
from the Duke of Xian's Residence.

251
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:45,242
Her Highness only has one daughter,

252
00:11:45,314 --> 00:11:47,194
and she is of marriageable age.

253
00:11:48,282 --> 00:11:51,201
No wonder she wants to break off
the engagement.

254
00:11:51,482 --> 00:11:53,642
She has found a better match.

255
00:11:55,321 --> 00:11:56,602
Did you hear that?

256
00:11:56,921 --> 00:11:58,961
From now on, stop talking

257
00:11:59,282 --> 00:12:00,921
about Mr. Jiang.

258
00:12:03,321 --> 00:12:05,122
- Bring this over there.
- Yes.

259
00:12:05,841 --> 00:12:06,441
Young Lady,

260
00:12:06,841 --> 00:12:09,041
do you really plan to stay?

261
00:12:09,921 --> 00:12:11,602
Grandma has done so much for me.

262
00:12:11,674 --> 00:12:12,835
Now, it's my turn

263
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:14,460
to keep her company.

264
00:12:15,242 --> 00:12:17,921
Even though the people here are cruel

265
00:12:18,002 --> 00:12:20,162
and some may have ill intentions,

266
00:12:20,816 --> 00:12:22,520
I'm willing to stay here for some time

267
00:12:23,041 --> 00:12:25,721
for the sake of Grandma.

268
00:13:01,561 --> 00:13:02,642
Old Madam said

269
00:13:02,667 --> 00:13:04,818
these were left by your mother.

270
00:13:12,122 --> 00:13:12,841
(Yining.)

271
00:13:13,721 --> 00:13:15,321
(Today, I went to a lake)

272
00:13:15,563 --> 00:13:17,002
(and saw many lotus flowers.)

273
00:13:17,152 --> 00:13:19,456
(They are more beautiful
than those in the residence's pond.)

274
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:21,728
(That's when I realized
how vast the outside world is.)

275
00:13:22,081 --> 00:13:23,321
(When you grow up,)

276
00:13:23,721 --> 00:13:25,800
(Gu Minglan)
(remember to see more of this world)

277
00:13:26,721 --> 00:13:29,642
(and not confine yourself
to a tiny place out of ignorance.)

278
00:13:30,522 --> 00:13:31,242
(Yining,)

279
00:13:32,201 --> 00:13:33,681
(I feel sorry for you.)

280
00:13:34,362 --> 00:13:35,841
(My life is nearing its end,)

281
00:13:36,122 --> 00:13:37,602
(and I can't watch you grow.)

282
00:13:38,122 --> 00:13:40,201
(Life seldom goes the way we want.)

283
00:13:40,841 --> 00:13:43,482
(I hope you will be strong
when you get hurt,)

284
00:13:43,921 --> 00:13:46,642
(and be independent
when those around you leave.)

285
00:13:47,321 --> 00:13:50,561
(Love yourself. Then, love
the people around who deserve it.)

286
00:13:51,002 --> 00:13:52,602
My mother was a peaceful person.

287
00:13:52,608 --> 00:13:53,808
But here in the Luo's Residence,

288
00:13:53,811 --> 00:13:56,249
she became a vicious
and unscrupulous person.

289
00:13:58,041 --> 00:13:59,882
Before this, we were in the side yard.

290
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:01,522
Now that we are back,

291
00:14:01,546 --> 00:14:03,265
I won't let anyone bully us anymore.

292
00:14:04,441 --> 00:14:05,041
By the way,

293
00:14:05,762 --> 00:14:07,081
have you found anything

294
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,192
from last night's fireworks?

295
00:14:08,721 --> 00:14:09,762
I checked

296
00:14:09,787 --> 00:14:10,787
the firework tube.

297
00:14:10,961 --> 00:14:12,242
Judging from the ash,

298
00:14:12,267 --> 00:14:14,027
it wasn't saltpeter.
It was red phosphorus.

299
00:14:14,384 --> 00:14:15,880
Firecrackers made with red phosphorus

300
00:14:15,907 --> 00:14:16,866
are highly explosive,

301
00:14:17,282 --> 00:14:18,921
which is why they are
rarely used nowadays.

302
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,184
The person who gave you
the fireworks tube last night

303
00:14:21,321 --> 00:14:23,162
was Ms. Li from the Bilian Pavilion.

304
00:14:24,642 --> 00:14:26,441
Fortunately, someone warned me.

305
00:14:26,474 --> 00:14:27,633
If not,

306
00:14:27,801 --> 00:14:29,801
the one injured wouldn't
have been Madam Jiang,

307
00:14:30,081 --> 00:14:30,921
but me.

308
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,112
Just now, I treated

309
00:14:32,128 --> 00:14:33,264
a nanny outside the residence.

310
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,441
I asked her something.

311
00:14:35,842 --> 00:14:36,842
Ms. Li

312
00:14:36,867 --> 00:14:38,869
is an experienced dowry nanny
from the Qiao Family.

313
00:14:39,081 --> 00:14:41,201
Her husband died young,
and they had no children.

314
00:14:41,602 --> 00:14:44,522
Her husband died young?

315
00:14:45,721 --> 00:14:47,730
When did he die?

316
00:14:47,824 --> 00:14:49,808
That summer
when you were sent to the side yard.

317
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,880
Did he fall ill and die

318
00:14:52,482 --> 00:14:54,242
after Mistress Qiao

319
00:14:54,314 --> 00:14:55,354
had a miscarriage?

320
00:14:55,522 --> 00:14:56,081
Yes.

321
00:14:56,522 --> 00:14:58,282
I heard that they spent all their money

322
00:14:58,307 --> 00:14:59,427
to treat his illness.

323
00:15:00,584 --> 00:15:02,326
(Jimo House)

324
00:15:06,282 --> 00:15:07,295
Seventh Lady

325
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,704
came to visit the Third Young Master.

326
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:11,081
Seventh Lady, please come in.

327
00:15:17,282 --> 00:15:19,201
How did you get injured?

328
00:15:19,441 --> 00:15:20,921
It must be very painful.

329
00:15:21,155 --> 00:15:22,395
It's just an old injury.

330
00:15:22,674 --> 00:15:24,315
There's no need to treat me.

331
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:26,801
No. You helped me.

332
00:15:26,921 --> 00:15:29,201
I have you return the favor.

333
00:15:29,321 --> 00:15:31,201
Qing Qu, take a look at his injury.

334
00:15:32,081 --> 00:15:32,681
Young Lady,

335
00:15:32,905 --> 00:15:35,276
I need to perform acupuncture
to assess his condition.

336
00:15:41,738 --> 00:15:42,579
Seventh Lady,

337
00:15:44,441 --> 00:15:45,441
I don't think

338
00:15:45,882 --> 00:15:47,242
this is necessary.

339
00:15:47,392 --> 00:15:48,320
Qing Qu has learned

340
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:49,980
from a famous physician
since she was a kid

341
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,833
and has also cured
many complicated illnesses.

342
00:15:51,858 --> 00:15:53,419
Let her take a look.

343
00:15:59,348 --> 00:16:01,108
Honestly,

344
00:16:01,801 --> 00:16:02,681
it's not necessary.

345
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,240
Third Young Master,
are you actually afraid of needles?

346
00:16:09,882 --> 00:16:10,681
Afraid of needles?

347
00:16:11,882 --> 00:16:13,002
A small number of people

348
00:16:13,027 --> 00:16:14,721
feel faint when they see needles.

349
00:16:19,122 --> 00:16:20,522
You are a man.

350
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:22,304
There's no way
you are afraid of needles.

351
00:16:22,321 --> 00:16:23,321
Come on, Qing Qu.

352
00:16:54,961 --> 00:16:55,961
This is strange.

353
00:16:56,762 --> 00:16:58,681
Why isn't he reacting at all?

354
00:16:59,602 --> 00:17:00,242
What's wrong?

355
00:17:00,681 --> 00:17:02,002
Is it curable?

356
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:08,602
It's impossible

357
00:17:08,624 --> 00:17:10,240
to restore his hand
to its original state.

358
00:17:12,877 --> 00:17:13,717
Young Master.

359
00:17:15,642 --> 00:17:16,281
Never mind.

360
00:17:16,912 --> 00:17:18,912
I have gotten used to it
after all these years.

361
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:22,073
Sorry for the trouble.

362
00:17:31,562 --> 00:17:32,642
Did you draw this?

363
00:17:32,768 --> 00:17:34,440
Do you also like to draw
pines and cypresses?

364
00:17:36,192 --> 00:17:37,290
My right hand can't draw,

365
00:17:37,761 --> 00:17:38,882
so I use my left hand.

366
00:17:39,082 --> 00:17:40,001
I can't draw quite well.

367
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,528
Do you like
pines and cypresses paintings, too?

368
00:17:43,082 --> 00:17:44,681
Grandpa gave me

369
00:17:44,706 --> 00:17:45,825
many of those.

370
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:48,001
Old Master's tree paintings

371
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:49,105
are well-known.

372
00:17:49,602 --> 00:17:51,162
They must be remarkable.

373
00:17:51,744 --> 00:17:53,580
It's a shame
I never had a chance to see them.

374
00:17:54,521 --> 00:17:56,481
If I could imitate his paintings,

375
00:17:56,721 --> 00:17:58,162
I believe I would improve.

376
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,065
Grandpa was better
at drawing figures.

377
00:18:02,128 --> 00:18:03,760
If you like landscape
and plant paintings,

378
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:05,960
you can refer to Li Xianxi's.
[*A famous painter from Song Dynasty]

379
00:18:08,122 --> 00:18:10,001
Sure. Thank you for the advice.

380
00:18:10,521 --> 00:18:11,602
Please rest well.

381
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,281
I will visit another day.

382
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:15,811
Take care.

383
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,480
I can't believe Seventh Lady
is the young lady

384
00:18:24,528 --> 00:18:25,100
we ran into

385
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,400
while chasing after Li Yinglong.

386
00:18:27,042 --> 00:18:28,708
Sadly, we failed.

387
00:18:29,001 --> 00:18:30,935
I thought she might lend you

388
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,000
Old Master's painting.

389
00:18:34,521 --> 00:18:36,042
We have only met a few times.

390
00:18:36,562 --> 00:18:37,642
It's expected

391
00:18:38,388 --> 00:18:39,989
that she wouldn't agree.

392
00:18:40,122 --> 00:18:41,842
But you were so kind to her

393
00:18:41,867 --> 00:18:43,548
during childhood.

394
00:18:44,281 --> 00:18:45,802
That was when we were kids.

395
00:18:46,377 --> 00:18:47,897
She must've forgotten.

396
00:18:54,802 --> 00:18:56,721
Young Master, is your hand all right?

397
00:18:57,162 --> 00:18:59,026
That girl was scary.

398
00:18:59,251 --> 00:19:00,233
But you did so well.

399
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,159
How did you manage not to react at all?

400
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,880
I almost lost it.

401
00:19:06,681 --> 00:19:08,530
Luckily, I sealed
the acupoints on my hand

402
00:19:08,562 --> 00:19:09,642
beforehand.

403
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:11,362
Official Chen found someone

404
00:19:11,387 --> 00:19:12,788
to heal your right hand,

405
00:19:13,042 --> 00:19:14,945
but to avoid attention here,

406
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:16,569
you pretend to use your left hand.

407
00:19:19,562 --> 00:19:20,402
Qing Qu,

408
00:19:21,241 --> 00:19:23,082
I noticed that Luo Shenyuan

409
00:19:23,090 --> 00:19:25,200
seemed particularly interested
in Grandpa's paintings.

410
00:19:25,362 --> 00:19:27,201
He mentioned them once

411
00:19:27,226 --> 00:19:28,306
at the Ancestral Shrine,

412
00:19:28,761 --> 00:19:30,521
and now he brought it up again.

413
00:19:31,001 --> 00:19:33,241
Perhaps he loves to paint.

414
00:19:34,481 --> 00:19:35,921
I don't think so.

415
00:19:36,681 --> 00:19:38,921
Is his right hand really incurable?

416
00:19:39,001 --> 00:19:40,402
It seems suspicious to me.

417
00:19:40,602 --> 00:19:42,641
If he doesn't react to acupuncture,

418
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,681
he should be paralyzed in bed.

419
00:19:45,162 --> 00:19:46,445
If his hand is fine,

420
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,521
how did he endure the needle?

421
00:19:51,082 --> 00:19:52,281
Is it possible

422
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,856
that his hand has long since recovered,

423
00:19:53,961 --> 00:19:56,492
and he is just pretending?

424
00:19:56,882 --> 00:19:58,961
But why would he do that?

425
00:19:59,681 --> 00:20:00,721
I have no idea.

426
00:20:01,042 --> 00:20:02,681
But I should thank him

427
00:20:02,706 --> 00:20:03,866
for this time.

428
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,840
Otherwise, I would've
been the one in trouble,

429
00:20:07,802 --> 00:20:09,201
We should find a chance

430
00:20:09,226 --> 00:20:11,026
to help Jimo House in the future.

431
00:20:11,402 --> 00:20:12,001
Yes, Young Lady.

432
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:15,489
Isn't that

433
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:17,034
Luo Yilian's handmaiden?

434
00:20:20,322 --> 00:20:22,322
She looks like she's hiding something.

435
00:20:22,768 --> 00:20:23,680
Let's go check it out.

436
00:20:31,441 --> 00:20:32,602
Young Lady said

437
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,439
she would stop meeting Mr. Jiang.

438
00:20:35,001 --> 00:20:36,281
Take the hairpin back.

439
00:20:36,425 --> 00:20:37,425
Young Master said

440
00:20:37,705 --> 00:20:38,506
Master promised

441
00:20:38,752 --> 00:20:40,512
the marriage pact wouldn't be broken.

442
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:42,680
He will find a way to make Madam
change her mind

443
00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:44,162
and then propose to the Fifth Lady.

444
00:20:44,288 --> 00:20:45,720
The Jiang Family is of lofty status.

445
00:20:45,921 --> 00:20:47,481
Young Lady isn't a good enough match.

446
00:20:48,241 --> 00:20:49,122
Please leave.

447
00:20:49,882 --> 00:20:52,201
- But...
- Luo Yilian is bold.

448
00:20:52,281 --> 00:20:54,082
I can't believe she's been

449
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:55,199
in contact with Mr. Jiang.

450
00:20:55,602 --> 00:20:57,241
Young Lady, should we

451
00:20:57,266 --> 00:20:58,585
report this to Second Master?

452
00:20:58,921 --> 00:20:59,642
Forget it.

453
00:21:00,201 --> 00:21:02,241
Since she rejected the Jiang Family,

454
00:21:02,266 --> 00:21:03,625
I will forget what I saw.

455
00:21:04,362 --> 00:21:05,921
Let's go greet Mother.

456
00:21:06,704 --> 00:21:14,416
(Bilian Pavilion)

457
00:21:20,578 --> 00:21:22,857
That Jiang fellow is ridiculous!

458
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:27,515
What happened, my dear?

459
00:21:28,322 --> 00:21:29,842
Why are you so angry?

460
00:21:29,867 --> 00:21:30,907
Calm down.

461
00:21:31,987 --> 00:21:34,596
Nothing is more important
than your health.

462
00:21:35,281 --> 00:21:37,426
My dear, don't be angry.

463
00:21:38,441 --> 00:21:39,991
Drink some tea to calm yourself.

464
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,521
Don't ruin your health over this.

465
00:21:46,602 --> 00:21:49,201
Did the Jiang Family change their minds
about the marriage pact?

466
00:21:49,449 --> 00:21:50,610
Jiang said

467
00:21:51,761 --> 00:21:53,521
they wouldn't break the engagement,

468
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:55,392
given the longstanding relationship
between us.

469
00:21:56,001 --> 00:21:57,710
Why are you so angry then?

470
00:21:57,735 --> 00:21:58,814
They also said...

471
00:22:00,281 --> 00:22:02,122
- They also said...
- What did they say?

472
00:22:04,001 --> 00:22:06,122
I can't even bring myself to say it.

473
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:08,521
Jiang said

474
00:22:08,882 --> 00:22:10,521
the marriage pact won't change,

475
00:22:10,546 --> 00:22:11,306
but Yining

476
00:22:12,602 --> 00:22:14,122
can only marry as a concubine.

477
00:22:14,426 --> 00:22:15,226
What?

478
00:22:15,562 --> 00:22:17,201
This is humiliating.

479
00:22:17,322 --> 00:22:19,642
Such a disgrace.

480
00:22:20,082 --> 00:22:21,281
The Luo Family

481
00:22:21,481 --> 00:22:23,802
has served as officials for generations.

482
00:22:23,904 --> 00:22:25,520
Besides, Yining is
a legitimate daughter.

483
00:22:25,642 --> 00:22:27,602
How could she possibly
be someone's concubine?

484
00:22:27,795 --> 00:22:28,674
Exactly.

485
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:31,001
This is intolerably humiliating.

486
00:22:31,761 --> 00:22:34,761
I suppose this marriage won't happen.

487
00:22:35,882 --> 00:22:37,402
With Old Madam's temper,

488
00:22:37,808 --> 00:22:40,040
if she finds out Yining
is going to be a concubine,

489
00:22:40,562 --> 00:22:42,241
she will faint immediately.

490
00:22:43,521 --> 00:22:44,642
Old Madam

491
00:22:44,682 --> 00:22:46,283
dotes on the Seventh Lady very much.

492
00:22:46,721 --> 00:22:48,001
Surely, she will find her

493
00:22:48,026 --> 00:22:49,466
a respectable match.

494
00:22:49,921 --> 00:22:52,042
A respectable match?

495
00:22:53,642 --> 00:22:55,322
Yining's bad reputation

496
00:22:55,681 --> 00:22:58,001
is spreading.

497
00:22:59,681 --> 00:23:01,201
Do you know why Jiang

498
00:23:02,001 --> 00:23:03,584
suddenly mentioned

499
00:23:03,609 --> 00:23:04,768
the concubine matter?

500
00:23:05,122 --> 00:23:06,961
He heard

501
00:23:07,241 --> 00:23:09,162
about Yining's misconduct in the past

502
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,720
and used it as an excuse against me.

503
00:23:10,802 --> 00:23:12,082
The Jiang Family

504
00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:13,569
have always wanted

505
00:23:13,594 --> 00:23:15,393
a noble lady for their son,

506
00:23:15,882 --> 00:23:18,281
but they were bound
by the marriage pact.

507
00:23:18,481 --> 00:23:19,721
Lucky them.

508
00:23:20,001 --> 00:23:21,681
They found the perfect opportunity.

509
00:23:22,122 --> 00:23:23,562
I can't understand this.

510
00:23:24,241 --> 00:23:25,721
What Yining did before

511
00:23:26,761 --> 00:23:28,241
happened in this residence

512
00:23:28,802 --> 00:23:30,481
a long time ago.

513
00:23:30,882 --> 00:23:32,642
Why are rumors about her

514
00:23:33,959 --> 00:23:36,160
suddenly making the rounds now?

515
00:23:46,201 --> 00:23:47,082
My dear,

516
00:23:48,281 --> 00:23:50,402
are you suspecting me?

517
00:23:54,122 --> 00:23:55,687
I never

518
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,720
leave the residence.

519
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,035
Noble ladies

520
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,460
like Madam Jiang

521
00:23:59,642 --> 00:24:00,842
wouldn't associate

522
00:24:00,867 --> 00:24:02,066
with someone of my status.

523
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,281
Where could I have spread the rumors?

524
00:24:06,562 --> 00:24:08,441
If you don't believe me,

525
00:24:08,642 --> 00:24:09,281
I...

526
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,540
Well, Yuechan.

527
00:24:11,771 --> 00:24:13,370
How could I possibly suspect you?

528
00:24:13,761 --> 00:24:15,681
Yuechan, I know you are kind.

529
00:24:16,082 --> 00:24:17,402
You speak up for Yining

530
00:24:17,427 --> 00:24:18,667
even after what she did to you.

531
00:24:20,162 --> 00:24:21,201
How should I put it?

532
00:24:21,802 --> 00:24:23,528
There are many people in this residence,

533
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,896
and gossip is bound to spread.

534
00:24:25,249 --> 00:24:26,530
You need to control them.

535
00:24:27,082 --> 00:24:28,362
All right.

536
00:24:29,042 --> 00:24:29,961
Well,

537
00:24:31,001 --> 00:24:33,602
I think let's call off
this marriage pact.

538
00:24:41,162 --> 00:24:42,322
My dear,

539
00:24:42,602 --> 00:24:44,521
you care about Seventh Lady.

540
00:24:44,547 --> 00:24:46,106
That's her blessing.

541
00:24:46,602 --> 00:24:48,481
Although she is still young,

542
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,352
she has reached the age of marriage.

543
00:24:50,368 --> 00:24:52,320
If this marriage
with the Jiang Family is called off,

544
00:24:52,345 --> 00:24:53,785
she will become a laughingstock.

545
00:24:54,362 --> 00:24:57,122
She won't be able to find
a good match in the future.

546
00:24:57,181 --> 00:24:58,540
If a few years are wasted,

547
00:24:58,688 --> 00:25:01,840
I'm afraid she may still end up marrying
into the Jiang Family as a concubine.

548
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:04,521
That makes sense.

549
00:25:05,281 --> 00:25:06,882
Yining's reputation

550
00:25:07,927 --> 00:25:09,647
is getting bad.

551
00:25:10,521 --> 00:25:12,921
If you break off the engagement,

552
00:25:13,602 --> 00:25:15,562
we will be responsible
for reneging on the promise.

553
00:25:15,587 --> 00:25:17,627
The two families may fall out.

554
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,640
As of now,

555
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,959
the Jiang Family is willing to take
Seventh Lady in as a concubine.

556
00:25:22,322 --> 00:25:24,481
Perhaps this might turn out
to be for the best.

557
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:26,352
If you and the Jiang Family
become in-laws,

558
00:25:26,402 --> 00:25:29,122
Official Jiang may feel guilty
about this

559
00:25:29,201 --> 00:25:31,362
and try to look out for you.

560
00:25:31,681 --> 00:25:32,602
Right?

561
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,840
(Caifu Abode)

562
00:25:41,921 --> 00:25:42,642
Greetings, Mother.

563
00:25:44,281 --> 00:25:46,042
What brings you here, Yining?

564
00:25:46,281 --> 00:25:47,761
I came to greet you, Mother.

565
00:25:47,882 --> 00:25:49,362
You just knelt all night.

566
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:51,241
You should rest.

567
00:25:51,362 --> 00:25:52,562
I'm perfectly well.

568
00:25:52,681 --> 00:25:55,476
I don't want to neglect the rule
of offering you greetings every day.

569
00:25:56,842 --> 00:25:58,281
I was about to ask you something.

570
00:25:58,602 --> 00:26:01,201
I heard that you decided to stay.

571
00:26:01,811 --> 00:26:04,362
Perfect. I have long wanted you back.

572
00:26:04,754 --> 00:26:06,857
You can stay here and keep me company.

573
00:26:07,241 --> 00:26:07,802
Come.

574
00:26:10,921 --> 00:26:11,562
Look.

575
00:26:12,961 --> 00:26:14,201
These supplementary

576
00:26:14,226 --> 00:26:15,786
are for you.

577
00:26:18,921 --> 00:26:20,625
I have a dozen of old ginsengs.

578
00:26:20,777 --> 00:26:21,777
Take all of them.

579
00:26:22,721 --> 00:26:23,642
And this.

580
00:26:24,281 --> 00:26:25,521
Pearl powder.

581
00:26:25,802 --> 00:26:27,642
It's ground from East Sea pearls,

582
00:26:27,667 --> 00:26:29,147
about the size of a little finger.

583
00:26:29,402 --> 00:26:31,145
You can add it to the milk

584
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,120
or apply it to your face.

585
00:26:32,842 --> 00:26:35,082
Mother, these are too expensive.

586
00:26:35,154 --> 00:26:36,115
Are you giving me so much

587
00:26:36,171 --> 00:26:38,521
so that I won't kneel
at the shrine anymore?

588
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,808
I won't let anyone punish you.

589
00:26:40,441 --> 00:26:42,082
Oh, and this.

590
00:26:42,761 --> 00:26:43,362
Take it.

591
00:26:44,481 --> 00:26:46,681
Gold and silver can ward off bad luck.

592
00:26:46,961 --> 00:26:47,961
From now on,

593
00:26:47,986 --> 00:26:50,145
may all of us be safe and peaceful.

594
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:51,721
Let me put this on you.

595
00:26:51,984 --> 00:26:53,600
Thank you for your blessing, Mother.

596
00:26:55,082 --> 00:26:55,921
Madam Lin,

597
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,839
Ms. Li from Mistress Qiao's abode came.

598
00:26:58,281 --> 00:26:59,241
What is she doing here?

599
00:26:59,362 --> 00:27:01,961
She wants to report to you
the household's expenses

600
00:27:01,986 --> 00:27:03,666
for this month
on behalf of Mistress Qiao.

601
00:27:04,241 --> 00:27:05,281
Summon her in.

602
00:27:06,521 --> 00:27:07,201
Take a seat.

603
00:27:12,521 --> 00:27:15,042
Greetings, Madam Lin and Seventh Lady.

604
00:27:19,802 --> 00:27:20,721
Madam Lin,

605
00:27:21,082 --> 00:27:22,681
these are the ledgers for this month.

606
00:27:22,881 --> 00:27:24,522
Mistress Qiao especially told me

607
00:27:24,721 --> 00:27:26,162
not to overstep the rules

608
00:27:26,281 --> 00:27:28,241
and to bring them to you for review.

609
00:27:35,402 --> 00:27:36,441
Madam Lin,

610
00:27:36,626 --> 00:27:39,491
Second Master reviewed them
a few days ago.

611
00:27:39,674 --> 00:27:42,122
He praised Mistress Qiao
for being frugal.

612
00:27:42,882 --> 00:27:44,521
In that case,

613
00:27:44,838 --> 00:27:46,358
why are you sending the ledger here?

614
00:27:47,362 --> 00:27:49,521
Please don't say that, Madam Lin.

615
00:27:49,681 --> 00:27:52,266
Mistress Qiao respects you very much.

616
00:27:53,402 --> 00:27:56,681
She saw a few brocades this morning

617
00:27:56,921 --> 00:27:59,122
while she was sorting out things
in the treasury,

618
00:27:59,961 --> 00:28:01,241
and she asked me

619
00:28:01,266 --> 00:28:03,226
to send them to Caifu Abode.

620
00:28:03,602 --> 00:28:05,162
All right. Leave them here.

621
00:28:05,921 --> 00:28:07,562
If there's nothing else,
you are dismissed.

622
00:28:08,281 --> 00:28:09,602
I will take my leave.

623
00:28:15,721 --> 00:28:16,402
Mother,

624
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:18,882
is Mistress Qiao managing

625
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:20,224
the ledgers of the residence?

626
00:28:23,264 --> 00:28:24,928
First Master
has been posted outside,

627
00:28:24,961 --> 00:28:27,562
and Madam Chen doesn't like
to manage household affairs.

628
00:28:27,802 --> 00:28:29,802
As for me, I need to
look after your Grandma.

629
00:28:29,866 --> 00:28:31,026
Therefore, your father

630
00:28:31,051 --> 00:28:32,570
temporarily entrusted this duty

631
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,720
to Mistress Qiao.

632
00:28:35,362 --> 00:28:36,681
Exactly, Seventh Lady.

633
00:28:36,706 --> 00:28:39,159
It's ridiculous for a concubine
to overstep the principal wife.

634
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:41,600
Second Master insisted that
Mistress Qiao manages the affairs

635
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,860
and claimed that Madam Lin doesn't

636
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:44,544
know the rules of noble families.

637
00:28:44,571 --> 00:28:45,571
You are talkative.

638
00:28:49,082 --> 00:28:50,441
Father made a bad choice.

639
00:28:53,921 --> 00:28:54,721
Madam Lin,

640
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:56,944
Second Master wants Seventh Lady
to come to the study.

641
00:28:58,681 --> 00:29:00,001
I will go with you.

642
00:29:00,162 --> 00:29:01,162
No, Mother.

643
00:29:01,187 --> 00:29:02,268
I can go myself.

644
00:29:02,402 --> 00:29:03,681
Well, then. Go on.

645
00:29:12,842 --> 00:29:13,521
Greetings, Father.

646
00:29:14,802 --> 00:29:15,842
You are here, Yining.

647
00:29:18,082 --> 00:29:19,281
I sent for you

648
00:29:19,594 --> 00:29:21,114
for a matter.

649
00:29:21,442 --> 00:29:23,323
Do you remember

650
00:29:23,642 --> 00:29:24,921
Madam Jiang

651
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:26,544
during your Grandma's
birthday banquet?

652
00:29:27,402 --> 00:29:28,082
Yes.

653
00:29:28,721 --> 00:29:30,042
She's the wife

654
00:29:30,067 --> 00:29:31,586
of my superior, Official Jiang.

655
00:29:31,882 --> 00:29:32,842
She is quite satisfied

656
00:29:34,402 --> 00:29:35,921
with you,

657
00:29:36,322 --> 00:29:37,362
so she mentioned

658
00:29:37,387 --> 00:29:38,988
the marriage pact to Official Jiang

659
00:29:39,013 --> 00:29:40,654
after she returned home.

660
00:29:41,042 --> 00:29:42,282
It's just that the Jiang Family

661
00:29:42,515 --> 00:29:43,914
has only one legitimate son.

662
00:29:44,370 --> 00:29:46,330
He is handsome and knowledgeable.

663
00:29:46,521 --> 00:29:47,481
Official Jiang

664
00:29:47,586 --> 00:29:49,225
doesn't wish his son

665
00:29:49,253 --> 00:29:50,772
to start a family too early,

666
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:52,689
worrying that it may affect

667
00:29:52,755 --> 00:29:54,755
his studies and career in the future.

668
00:29:55,042 --> 00:29:56,761
He told me

669
00:30:01,162 --> 00:30:02,562
that the wedding

670
00:30:03,241 --> 00:30:04,441
needn't be grand.

671
00:30:04,642 --> 00:30:06,602
Just send a sedan chair
from the back door...

672
00:30:06,627 --> 00:30:07,228
Father,

673
00:30:07,961 --> 00:30:09,987
you want to marry me off as a concubine?

674
00:30:13,201 --> 00:30:14,481
I'm doing this

675
00:30:14,842 --> 00:30:16,481
for your own good.

676
00:30:16,721 --> 00:30:18,625
Think about your reputation.

677
00:30:18,992 --> 00:30:20,630
You won't be able to find a better match

678
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,241
if you miss the chance
with the Jiang Family.

679
00:30:23,642 --> 00:30:24,961
The Luo and Jiang Families

680
00:30:25,082 --> 00:30:26,961
have been tight for generations.

681
00:30:26,976 --> 00:30:28,448
If you marry into the Jiang Family,

682
00:30:28,448 --> 00:30:29,160
they will

683
00:30:29,921 --> 00:30:32,241
treat you well.

684
00:30:32,283 --> 00:30:33,362
They will treat me well?

685
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,640
The Jiang Family intended
to break off the engagement first,

686
00:30:36,961 --> 00:30:37,961
but failed,

687
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:39,808
and now they want to take me in
as a concubine.

688
00:30:40,144 --> 00:30:41,760
A legitimate daughter to be a concubine?

689
00:30:42,721 --> 00:30:43,402
Father,

690
00:30:43,642 --> 00:30:45,747
you have always valued

691
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,960
family status, ethics, and rules
above all else.

692
00:30:48,441 --> 00:30:50,322
If this gets out,

693
00:30:50,448 --> 00:30:52,400
it'll bring great disgrace
to the Luo's Residence.

694
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,322
Marriages should be decided by parents
and arranged through matchmakers.

695
00:31:00,042 --> 00:31:02,921
The Luo Family has been on the decline.

696
00:31:03,201 --> 00:31:04,481
It's a great fortune

697
00:31:04,562 --> 00:31:06,322
to form a union with the Jiang Family.

698
00:31:06,441 --> 00:31:08,961
Do you really want me

699
00:31:08,988 --> 00:31:11,508
to fall out with them for you?

700
00:31:12,562 --> 00:31:13,921
I see it now.

701
00:31:14,882 --> 00:31:17,402
You are afraid of offending
the Jiang Family

702
00:31:17,521 --> 00:31:19,281
because it may affect your promotion.

703
00:31:19,306 --> 00:31:20,706
You only have yourself to blame.

704
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,320
You deserve this.

705
00:31:22,681 --> 00:31:24,015
They caught wind

706
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,166
of your past misconduct,

707
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:26,864
which is why they broke off
the engagement.

708
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,080
However, considering
the relationship with us,

709
00:31:29,481 --> 00:31:30,882
they chose to compromise

710
00:31:30,907 --> 00:31:32,748
and came up with this method.

711
00:31:33,162 --> 00:31:34,562
Be grateful.

712
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:38,402
I just returned home,

713
00:31:38,842 --> 00:31:40,362
and my bad reputation

714
00:31:40,562 --> 00:31:42,042
is already spreading.

715
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,900
No wonder Luo Yilian
didn't want to marry into the family.

716
00:31:49,402 --> 00:31:50,441
Yining,

717
00:31:51,481 --> 00:31:52,721
if you

718
00:31:53,322 --> 00:31:55,201
truly care about me,

719
00:31:55,481 --> 00:31:58,001
you should ease my burden

720
00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:00,010
and contribute to the Luo Family.

721
00:32:00,362 --> 00:32:01,882
But Father, have you ever thought

722
00:32:02,201 --> 00:32:04,162
that Grandma
would be extremely upset and sick

723
00:32:04,402 --> 00:32:05,842
if she found out about this?

724
00:32:07,082 --> 00:32:08,921
If you accept this marriage,

725
00:32:09,082 --> 00:32:10,721
I can persuade her.

726
00:32:10,842 --> 00:32:12,882
Besides, if Mother...

727
00:32:13,328 --> 00:32:15,680
If she gets agitated again,
you should be held accountable.

728
00:32:15,842 --> 00:32:17,721
- Me?
- Of course.

729
00:32:17,961 --> 00:32:19,681
Think this through. Now leave.

730
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,081
Leave.

731
00:32:47,162 --> 00:32:49,201
Seventh Lady, is anything troubling you?

732
00:32:50,961 --> 00:32:52,001
Father wanted

733
00:32:52,032 --> 00:32:54,200
to marry me off
to the Jiang Family as a concubine.

734
00:32:54,721 --> 00:32:55,602
Besides,

735
00:32:56,042 --> 00:32:57,721
he has already agreed to this marriage.

736
00:32:57,842 --> 00:32:58,322
What?

737
00:32:58,761 --> 00:33:00,961
Why would Second Master
make such a decision?

738
00:33:03,241 --> 00:33:04,562
I turned it down.

739
00:33:05,241 --> 00:33:06,721
But I don't wish Grandma

740
00:33:07,042 --> 00:33:08,521
to know about this.

741
00:33:08,802 --> 00:33:10,082
I will tell her about it

742
00:33:10,162 --> 00:33:11,721
once everything is settled.

743
00:33:12,642 --> 00:33:14,642
But people in the residence
might gossip.

744
00:33:14,842 --> 00:33:16,521
If Grandma learns about it,

745
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,080
she will be furious.

746
00:33:19,481 --> 00:33:22,201
So Ms. Xu,

747
00:33:22,521 --> 00:33:23,562
in the meantime,

748
00:33:23,587 --> 00:33:26,187
don't let Grandma leave her place
to meet others.

749
00:33:26,842 --> 00:33:28,042
Understood.

750
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,519
Greetings, Mistress Qiao.

751
00:33:50,882 --> 00:33:51,802
Ms. Xu,

752
00:33:52,122 --> 00:33:53,961
we came to offer greetings
to Old Madam.

753
00:33:54,082 --> 00:33:56,602
She is not welling quite well today,

754
00:33:56,761 --> 00:33:58,162
so she skips it.

755
00:33:58,441 --> 00:34:00,842
Please leave, Mistress Qiao.

756
00:34:02,802 --> 00:34:04,241
Thank you, Ms. Xu.

757
00:34:04,441 --> 00:34:06,201
We will return

758
00:34:06,362 --> 00:34:07,842
once Old Madam recovers.

759
00:34:17,602 --> 00:34:18,442
Mistress Qiao,

760
00:34:18,602 --> 00:34:21,361
by the look of it,
we can't meet Old Madam.

761
00:34:22,042 --> 00:34:25,011
But how do we break the news
of the Jiang Family

762
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,961
taking Seventh Lady
as a concubine to her?

763
00:34:28,761 --> 00:34:30,801
Old Madam has been very wary of me.

764
00:34:31,162 --> 00:34:33,841
Predictably, we can't meet her.

765
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:36,082
Mistress Qiao, do you have another plan?

766
00:34:45,843 --> 00:34:46,642
Ms. Xu.

767
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,760
Old Madam, why are you up?

768
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,961
Seventh Lady instructed me

769
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:06,050
to let you rest well.

770
00:35:07,681 --> 00:35:08,962
No one has come

771
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:10,440
to offer greetings

772
00:35:10,465 --> 00:35:11,744
these two days.

773
00:35:12,522 --> 00:35:15,065
You are keeping a close on me.

774
00:35:16,721 --> 00:35:18,162
Does anything happen

775
00:35:18,281 --> 00:35:19,761
to Yining again?

776
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,360
You have worried too much.

777
00:35:21,562 --> 00:35:23,442
Seventh Lady is caring.

778
00:35:23,522 --> 00:35:25,641
She wants you to have peace of mind
for some days.

779
00:35:26,179 --> 00:35:27,380
This girl.

780
00:35:27,539 --> 00:35:29,059
I can tell it's her idea.

781
00:35:29,602 --> 00:35:30,442
Well.

782
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:32,516
I will do as she wishes

783
00:35:33,002 --> 00:35:34,761
and rest these days.

784
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,160
I will have someone bring water.

785
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:37,971
Sure.

786
00:35:47,082 --> 00:35:49,082
Yue, these few pots

787
00:35:49,107 --> 00:35:50,428
are sent by Seventh Lady.

788
00:35:50,576 --> 00:35:52,040
Old Madam cherishes them very much.

789
00:35:52,115 --> 00:35:53,274
Tend them with more care.

790
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:54,642
Don't worry, Ms. Lyu.

791
00:35:54,682 --> 00:35:56,282
Madam Lin told me about it.

792
00:35:56,761 --> 00:35:58,162
She also cares about

793
00:35:58,187 --> 00:35:59,187
Seventh Lady.

794
00:35:59,562 --> 00:36:01,602
I have served here for a long time.

795
00:36:01,761 --> 00:36:02,761
Knowing that Seventh Lady

796
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:04,226
is close to Old Madam,

797
00:36:04,642 --> 00:36:07,042
Old Madam Luo will miss her
very much after Seventh Lady

798
00:36:07,122 --> 00:36:09,201
marries into
the Jiang Family as the principal wife.

799
00:36:09,361 --> 00:36:11,303
If only

800
00:36:11,328 --> 00:36:12,687
this were true.

801
00:36:12,882 --> 00:36:14,082
What do you mean?

802
00:36:14,442 --> 00:36:16,681
Of course, Seventh Lady
will marry as the principal wife.

803
00:36:16,706 --> 00:36:17,666
But she won't.

804
00:36:17,922 --> 00:36:19,681
The Jiang Family wanted her
as a concubine.

805
00:36:19,769 --> 00:36:20,930
Is this a mistake?

806
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,410
Seventh Lady is
a legitimate daughter.

807
00:36:22,443 --> 00:36:23,843
How could she become a concubine?

808
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:25,104
Second Master agreed to it...

809
00:36:25,161 --> 00:36:26,402
What are you talking about?

810
00:36:27,841 --> 00:36:29,042
Say it again.

811
00:36:29,218 --> 00:36:31,298
Who will become a concubine
in the Jiang Family?

812
00:36:31,562 --> 00:36:33,586
Please punish me for talking nonsense.

813
00:36:33,922 --> 00:36:36,241
Please take care of your body,
Old Madam.

814
00:36:38,482 --> 00:36:39,162
Old Madam.

815
00:36:40,562 --> 00:36:42,962
- Old Madam!
- Old Madam!

816
00:36:43,042 --> 00:36:44,642
- Send for a physician!
- Yes.

817
00:36:44,761 --> 00:36:45,881
Send for a physician.

818
00:36:45,962 --> 00:36:46,721
Give me your hand.

819
00:36:58,602 --> 00:36:59,281
Physician Li,

820
00:36:59,522 --> 00:37:00,721
how's my mother?

821
00:37:01,642 --> 00:37:02,442
Official Luo,

822
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,240
Old Madam Luo's heart condition worsens

823
00:37:04,361 --> 00:37:06,442
every time she gets agitated.

824
00:37:07,002 --> 00:37:10,642
It will be beyond cure
if this continues to worsen.

825
00:37:11,042 --> 00:37:12,642
If she regains consciousness,

826
00:37:13,042 --> 00:37:15,241
you must be careful afterward.

827
00:37:15,721 --> 00:37:17,841
When will my Grandma wake up?

828
00:37:17,922 --> 00:37:20,401
Old Madam Luo will wake up tomorrow
at the latest.

829
00:37:20,881 --> 00:37:21,881
Don't provoke her anymore

830
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:24,562
after that.

831
00:37:37,642 --> 00:37:40,162
Ms. Xu, what happened?

832
00:37:40,522 --> 00:37:42,562
Why would Grandma suddenly collapse?

833
00:37:42,586 --> 00:37:44,841
We keep Old Madam in her room.

834
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,830
Mistress Qiao came to offer greetings
this morning,

835
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,520
but I stopped her.

836
00:37:48,544 --> 00:37:50,500
Old Madam likes to check
on her favorite peony

837
00:37:50,522 --> 00:37:52,841
after her nap every day,

838
00:37:52,962 --> 00:37:55,082
and I stopped her.

839
00:37:55,482 --> 00:37:56,881
I just left

840
00:37:57,042 --> 00:37:58,442
for a moment,

841
00:37:58,602 --> 00:38:00,442
and she went out to see the flowers.

842
00:38:00,562 --> 00:38:01,922
She overheard

843
00:38:02,042 --> 00:38:03,401
the servants gossiping,

844
00:38:03,426 --> 00:38:05,225
then became agitated and fainted.

845
00:38:05,482 --> 00:38:06,841
It's my fault.

846
00:38:07,002 --> 00:38:08,562
I'm to blame.

847
00:38:09,122 --> 00:38:10,602
Ms. Xu, please get up.

848
00:38:12,562 --> 00:38:14,122
You did nothing wrong.

849
00:38:14,522 --> 00:38:16,801
But that's too much of a coincidence.

850
00:38:17,162 --> 00:38:19,002
Seventh Lady, do you suspect...

851
00:38:25,776 --> 00:38:26,800
How could she do that?

852
00:38:27,522 --> 00:38:30,361
The position of the principal wife
has been her obsession.

853
00:38:30,522 --> 00:38:32,562
After my mother's passing,

854
00:38:32,841 --> 00:38:35,482
Grandma took Madam Lin in,

855
00:38:36,002 --> 00:38:38,881
and she couldn't get over this.

856
00:38:39,281 --> 00:38:40,442
But I need to

857
00:38:40,467 --> 00:38:41,786
look into this.

858
00:38:42,241 --> 00:38:43,241
The priority now

859
00:38:43,313 --> 00:38:45,233
is to heal Grandma's
heart condition.

860
00:38:45,602 --> 00:38:47,279
But since Second Master has decided

861
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,240
to marry you off to the Jiang Family
as a concubine,

862
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,961
I don't think
he will take back his word.

863
00:38:54,201 --> 00:38:55,442
Regarding this,

864
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,319
I will handle it.

865
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,601
(Noble Conduct)

866
00:39:07,536 --> 00:39:10,100
Does Seventh Lady really want
to meet Mr. Jiang in private

867
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,296
to break off the engagement?

868
00:39:11,361 --> 00:39:13,562
So I'm sent to deliver
the message to the Jiang's Residence.

869
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,168
She requested to meet with him tomorrow.

870
00:39:15,216 --> 00:39:16,250
You must be very careful.

871
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,360
Don't let anyone see you.

872
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:19,760
If Second Master finds out,
he will punish the Seventh Lady.

873
00:39:20,241 --> 00:39:21,681
This may be a bold action,

874
00:39:21,706 --> 00:39:22,826
but Seventh Lady has no choice.

875
00:39:23,042 --> 00:39:24,922
I got to go. Do take care of her well.

876
00:39:29,841 --> 00:39:31,201
Are you sure about this?

877
00:39:31,442 --> 00:39:33,042
I heard every word loud and clear.

878
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,040
Her marrying into the Jiang Family
as a concubine

879
00:39:36,067 --> 00:39:38,171
is a decision made
by Father and the Jiang Family.

880
00:39:38,841 --> 00:39:41,042
But she actually wants
to call off the engagement.

881
00:39:41,442 --> 00:39:42,459
Luo Yining

882
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,400
is indeed as brazen as she once was.

883
00:39:44,801 --> 00:39:45,361
Young Lady,

884
00:39:45,562 --> 00:39:47,866
should we tell Mistress Qiao about this?

885
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,520
She's been busy with treasury affairs
since this morning.

886
00:39:50,777 --> 00:39:52,138
I will handle

887
00:39:52,241 --> 00:39:53,482
a trivial matter like this.

888
00:39:53,602 --> 00:39:54,962
Keep an eye on the Haitang Abode.

889
00:39:55,321 --> 00:39:56,882
Report to me

890
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:58,144
once Luo Yining leaves the place.

891
00:39:58,281 --> 00:40:00,097
- Yes, Young Lady.
- Wait.

892
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:04,482
Send a message to Father.

893
00:40:04,721 --> 00:40:06,761
Secretly. Don't let anyone see you.

894
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:07,540
Yes, Young Lady.

895
00:40:10,642 --> 00:40:12,688
(Liuhe Tavern)

896
00:40:12,801 --> 00:40:13,522
Come, Shenyuan.

897
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:15,160
Try the sweet and sour fish I prepared.

898
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:15,674
Sure.

899
00:40:24,082 --> 00:40:25,361
You used to say,

900
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,552
"A gentleman should stay clear
of killing practice".

901
00:40:27,681 --> 00:40:29,642
But now you are hiding in this tavern.

902
00:40:29,841 --> 00:40:31,681
Senior Shen Lan is knowledgeable,

903
00:40:32,241 --> 00:40:33,922
but you end up dealing with farming.

904
00:40:34,354 --> 00:40:35,794
No need to take pity on us, Shenyuan.

905
00:40:36,241 --> 00:40:37,922
Master always taught me,

906
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:41,162
"A bowl of coarse rice
and a gourd of plain water

907
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,601
under a thin roof

908
00:40:42,681 --> 00:40:44,482
may be unbearable for most,

909
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:46,704
but Yan Hui gladly upheld his belief
without complaints."

910
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,521
Shenyuan,

911
00:40:55,914 --> 00:40:57,273
compared to you and Daoyan,

912
00:40:57,721 --> 00:40:59,321
our lives are much easier.

913
00:41:00,305 --> 00:41:01,265
Back then,

914
00:41:01,801 --> 00:41:04,042
both you and Daoyan
were Master's proudest students.

915
00:41:04,201 --> 00:41:05,002
But now,

916
00:41:05,122 --> 00:41:07,122
Daoyan is on the run,

917
00:41:07,361 --> 00:41:10,427
and you have to swallow your pride
to live with a family like the Luo's

918
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:12,162
while enduring humiliations.

919
00:41:12,801 --> 00:41:13,321
Enough said.

920
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,642
Let's put aside unpleasant things today.

921
00:41:16,522 --> 00:41:17,042
Cheers.

922
00:41:24,801 --> 00:41:27,082
By the way,
I heard from Shopkeeper Zheng

923
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,742
that you have found the evidence

924
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,857
that can overturn Master's case.

925
00:41:33,122 --> 00:41:34,962
I thought I couldn't find anything

926
00:41:35,026 --> 00:41:36,066
from the Luo's Residence.

927
00:41:36,689 --> 00:41:38,627
Unexpectedly, a new clue appears.

928
00:41:38,962 --> 00:41:40,948
I still need time to track it down.

929
00:41:41,401 --> 00:41:41,841
Well,

930
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,320
what about Li Yinglong?

931
00:41:43,522 --> 00:41:44,681
Any news about him?

932
00:41:45,522 --> 00:41:46,241
I almost forgot.

933
00:41:48,002 --> 00:41:49,881
This is his recent whereabouts.

934
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,360
(Bamboo Workshop on West Street)
