=The Rise of Ning=

00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,320
(Adapted from Wen Tan's novel "Chancellor
Training Handbook" from Jinjiang Literature)

3
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:38,533
=Episode 9=

4
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:40,955
(Muxi Hall)

5
00:01:40,955 --> 00:01:43,955
You want to matchmake
Yiyu and Cheng Lang.

6
00:01:44,755 --> 00:01:45,675
Yes.

7
00:01:46,955 --> 00:01:48,356
I figure Cheng Lang is

8
00:01:48,436 --> 00:01:50,996
young and successful.

9
00:01:51,076 --> 00:01:52,076
He has a good background.

10
00:01:52,196 --> 00:01:53,076
As for Yiyu,

11
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:54,996
she's reached the marrying age.

12
00:01:55,196 --> 00:01:56,475
The two of them can be together,

13
00:01:56,595 --> 00:01:58,436
it will be a good marriage.

14
00:01:58,836 --> 00:02:00,356
He comes from a good family.

15
00:02:00,556 --> 00:02:02,196
But there are things

16
00:02:02,475 --> 00:02:04,276
you don't know about him.

17
00:02:06,796 --> 00:02:08,475
Are you concerned that Cheng Lang

18
00:02:08,556 --> 00:02:10,436
isn't the son of the principal wife?

19
00:02:10,595 --> 00:02:11,875
But he passed the Imperial Exam

20
00:02:11,915 --> 00:02:13,236
at such a young age.

21
00:02:13,276 --> 00:02:15,075
He also has Marquis Lu's support.

22
00:02:15,276 --> 00:02:18,116
Having a son-in-law
as outstanding as him

23
00:02:18,236 --> 00:02:19,996
will greatly benefit our family.

24
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:23,556
It doesn't matter who his mother is.

25
00:02:23,836 --> 00:02:25,635
What matters is the personality.

26
00:02:25,836 --> 00:02:27,396
When Cheng Lang was young,

27
00:02:27,516 --> 00:02:30,236
he was often mistreated
by his older brothers.

28
00:02:31,156 --> 00:02:34,236
Then, he gained Lu Jiaxue's support.

29
00:02:34,276 --> 00:02:35,315
Do you know

30
00:02:35,475 --> 00:02:37,156
how he took revenge

31
00:02:37,236 --> 00:02:39,035
on his two older brothers?

32
00:02:39,716 --> 00:02:41,996
One died in an accident.

33
00:02:42,075 --> 00:02:44,595
The other is hiding in a foreign land.

34
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:47,355
What happens here

35
00:02:47,676 --> 00:02:50,156
is beyond our wildest imagination.

36
00:02:51,195 --> 00:02:52,795
Lu Jiaxue

37
00:02:53,035 --> 00:02:55,276
is too cunning and unpredictable.

38
00:02:55,635 --> 00:02:57,595
He became Marquis Anbei

39
00:02:57,836 --> 00:03:00,116
at such a young age.

40
00:03:01,276 --> 00:03:04,676
Ever since Cheng Lang
started working for Lu Jiaxue,

41
00:03:04,755 --> 00:03:05,755
the connections he has

42
00:03:05,836 --> 00:03:08,355
have been too complicated

43
00:03:08,436 --> 00:03:10,156
and dangerous.

44
00:03:11,595 --> 00:03:13,195
Our precious Yiyu

45
00:03:13,635 --> 00:03:16,075
is the first granddaughter
meticulously nurtured

46
00:03:16,116 --> 00:03:17,396
by our own hands.

47
00:03:17,475 --> 00:03:19,075
I could never bear

48
00:03:19,396 --> 00:03:21,996
to marry Yiyu off to a family

49
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:24,355
that even we cannot fathom.

50
00:03:27,635 --> 00:03:28,755
Lan,

51
00:03:29,716 --> 00:03:31,516
ever heard of this saying?

52
00:03:31,915 --> 00:03:33,635
"A good woman
deserves a good match."

53
00:03:34,276 --> 00:03:37,035
Erudite Liu's firstborn, Liu Jing,

54
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:39,915
is a brilliant and upright person.
He is a true gentleman.

55
00:03:40,075 --> 00:03:42,996
Madam Liu is very fond of Yiyu as well.

56
00:03:43,075 --> 00:03:44,396
Isn't this

57
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:46,116
the perfect match

58
00:03:46,236 --> 00:03:47,436
we are looking for?

59
00:03:48,956 --> 00:03:49,996
However,

60
00:03:50,875 --> 00:03:53,676
the Liu family is only lower rank six.

61
00:03:55,396 --> 00:03:56,436
Liu Jing

62
00:03:56,516 --> 00:03:58,436
will attend the autumn
examination this year.

63
00:03:58,516 --> 00:03:59,875
I believe

64
00:03:59,956 --> 00:04:01,836
he will return with success and fame.

65
00:04:04,156 --> 00:04:05,556
Indeed.

66
00:04:06,436 --> 00:04:09,075
I should've been more mindful.

67
00:04:20,995 --> 00:04:21,716
Xue Zhi.

68
00:04:21,795 --> 00:04:23,156
Bring me a brazier.

69
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:24,235
Why do you need it?

70
00:04:24,355 --> 00:04:25,196
Burn them all.

71
00:04:26,396 --> 00:04:28,035
Stop standing there. Get the brazier.

72
00:04:35,115 --> 00:04:37,156
Young Lady, what is this about?

73
00:04:37,555 --> 00:04:39,156
There are things we must burn

74
00:04:39,235 --> 00:04:40,316
to find closure.

75
00:04:47,956 --> 00:04:48,675
Song Zhi.

76
00:04:48,756 --> 00:04:50,156
Get rid of this brazier.

77
00:04:50,516 --> 00:04:51,915
Yes, Ms. Xue Zhi.

78
00:06:15,995 --> 00:06:17,276
My kite fell there.

79
00:06:17,396 --> 00:06:19,076
Could you pick it up for me?

80
00:06:21,435 --> 00:06:22,995
Are you listening?

81
00:06:23,115 --> 00:06:24,956
Could you please fetch the kite for me?

82
00:06:27,396 --> 00:06:28,355
If you won't help me out,

83
00:06:28,475 --> 00:06:29,795
I'll get the kite myself.

84
00:07:04,076 --> 00:07:05,156
You can't see?

85
00:07:05,915 --> 00:07:06,555
Are they

86
00:07:06,675 --> 00:07:07,876
locking you up in here?

87
00:07:08,115 --> 00:07:08,995
Who are you?

88
00:07:20,716 --> 00:07:21,475
What are you doing?

89
00:07:21,795 --> 00:07:22,795
What are you doing?

90
00:07:22,876 --> 00:07:24,076
I'm giving you medicine.

91
00:07:24,196 --> 00:07:25,115
What medicine?

92
00:07:25,516 --> 00:07:27,076
Did my oldest brother send you here?

93
00:07:27,516 --> 00:07:29,435
Let go of my hand.

94
00:07:34,355 --> 00:07:35,756
You went blind

95
00:07:36,115 --> 00:07:37,595
at such a young age.

96
00:07:37,836 --> 00:07:39,115
You deserve pity.

97
00:07:39,555 --> 00:07:41,276
But it's no reason
to throw your life away.

98
00:07:42,475 --> 00:07:43,196
This is

99
00:07:43,316 --> 00:07:44,355
the eye medicine

100
00:07:44,475 --> 00:07:45,196
my healer friend

101
00:07:45,355 --> 00:07:47,276
prescribed for you.

102
00:07:49,555 --> 00:07:51,355
Apply the medicine every day.

103
00:07:52,915 --> 00:07:54,396
I also brought

104
00:07:54,475 --> 00:07:56,196
a basket full of delicious food.

105
00:07:56,915 --> 00:07:59,115
There is a bouquet
of fragrant plantain lily.

106
00:07:59,555 --> 00:08:00,716
That's all for now.

107
00:08:00,836 --> 00:08:01,956
I must get going.

108
00:08:48,915 --> 00:08:51,315
I'll show you my paper cutting.

109
00:08:51,955 --> 00:08:54,116
This is the West Lake.

110
00:08:55,596 --> 00:08:58,315
There is a small boat on this lake.

111
00:08:59,356 --> 00:09:01,195
There are two people onboard.

112
00:09:06,116 --> 00:09:07,195
Can you see this?

113
00:09:08,636 --> 00:09:09,876
How much can you see?

114
00:09:12,356 --> 00:09:13,396
I can't see it.

115
00:09:14,156 --> 00:09:15,476
But I have no need to.

116
00:09:16,116 --> 00:09:16,955
I know

117
00:09:17,276 --> 00:09:18,315
one is Mei,

118
00:09:18,795 --> 00:09:19,876
and the other is me.

119
00:09:20,516 --> 00:09:21,435
Who says so?

120
00:09:21,555 --> 00:09:23,035
It's a father and his son.

121
00:09:23,179 --> 00:09:24,955
It's not you and me.

122
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:26,835
Could you make another one

123
00:09:27,236 --> 00:09:29,835
with you and me in it?

124
00:09:30,675 --> 00:09:32,636
You're always asking for things.

125
00:09:32,756 --> 00:09:33,996
What's in it for me?

126
00:09:34,675 --> 00:09:35,795
What do you like?

127
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:37,876
I like...

128
00:09:38,675 --> 00:09:40,195
I like clay dolls.

129
00:09:40,555 --> 00:09:41,476
Can you make one?

130
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:44,116
Not at the moment.

131
00:09:44,715 --> 00:09:45,955
But I can always learn.

132
00:09:46,516 --> 00:09:48,675
Very well. I'll be waiting.

133
00:09:48,795 --> 00:09:49,955
Don't break your promise.

134
00:10:28,835 --> 00:10:29,516
Young Master.

135
00:10:29,715 --> 00:10:31,476
Cheng Lang is Lu Jiaxue's nephew.

136
00:10:31,596 --> 00:10:32,435
Did he come here

137
00:10:32,516 --> 00:10:34,035
just to visit Old Madam?

138
00:10:34,236 --> 00:10:35,756
There's more to it.

139
00:10:37,075 --> 00:10:38,476
Li Yinglong confessed.

140
00:10:38,756 --> 00:10:40,476
They are here for the testimony.

141
00:10:41,356 --> 00:10:41,996
Young Master,

142
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:42,750
you can't be making

143
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:43,636
paper cutting.

144
00:10:43,675 --> 00:10:44,835
They could find the testimony.

145
00:10:44,955 --> 00:10:45,675
What then?

146
00:10:45,955 --> 00:10:46,996
It took us years

147
00:10:47,116 --> 00:10:47,996
to find nothing.

148
00:10:48,276 --> 00:10:49,675
There's no way they can find it now.

149
00:10:49,996 --> 00:10:50,636
What if

150
00:10:50,756 --> 00:10:52,195
they are smarter than you?

151
00:10:53,835 --> 00:10:55,075
If he were so smart,

152
00:10:55,195 --> 00:10:56,555
I could use him to take point.

153
00:10:57,315 --> 00:10:58,876
Is it your plan to use him

154
00:10:58,955 --> 00:11:00,516
to bait Old Madam
into taking action?

155
00:11:05,555 --> 00:11:06,675
The peonies are

156
00:11:06,795 --> 00:11:08,156
blooming very well this year.

157
00:11:10,435 --> 00:11:10,915
Make sure

158
00:11:10,955 --> 00:11:13,035
to deliver a few pots
to Seventh Lady,

159
00:11:13,276 --> 00:11:14,396
Old Madam,

160
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:15,596
and Madam Lin.

161
00:11:15,876 --> 00:11:16,915
Understood, Young Master.

162
00:11:17,476 --> 00:11:18,835
By the way,

163
00:11:19,156 --> 00:11:20,195
the old maids usually

164
00:11:20,276 --> 00:11:22,856
paid us no attention
when we delivered flowers there.

165
00:11:22,864 --> 00:11:23,990
Now, they are eager to deliver

166
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:24,915
the flowers.

167
00:11:25,156 --> 00:11:27,035
They even praise you
for being thoughtful.

168
00:11:27,116 --> 00:11:28,236
Perhaps your sincerity

169
00:11:28,356 --> 00:11:29,236
has moved them.

170
00:11:29,715 --> 00:11:31,116
Old Madam views me differently

171
00:11:31,236 --> 00:11:32,476
because of Seventh Lady.

172
00:11:33,276 --> 00:11:35,195
Did you think it was the flowers?

173
00:11:46,075 --> 00:11:46,715
Young Master.

174
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:47,756
Why is he

175
00:11:47,876 --> 00:11:48,636
staring at us?

176
00:11:48,672 --> 00:11:49,670
We are not crossing paths

177
00:11:49,835 --> 00:11:50,756
with him.

178
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:51,356
Relax.

179
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:53,915
Wait, gentlemen.

180
00:11:56,756 --> 00:11:57,955
How may I assist you?

181
00:11:59,236 --> 00:12:01,636
Could you tell me
where Tingfeng Pavilion is?

182
00:12:02,915 --> 00:12:04,035
Go around the hill

183
00:12:04,396 --> 00:12:05,075
and turn left.

184
00:12:05,195 --> 00:12:06,195
Then, follow the path.

185
00:12:07,315 --> 00:12:08,075
Thank you.

186
00:12:12,996 --> 00:12:14,075
That was close.

187
00:12:14,116 --> 00:12:14,596
I thought

188
00:12:14,675 --> 00:12:15,996
we'd been compromised.

189
00:12:16,276 --> 00:12:17,876
He is here for the testimony.

190
00:12:17,955 --> 00:12:19,276
Keep a level head.

191
00:12:20,602 --> 00:12:26,640
(Tingfeng Pavilion)

192
00:12:42,795 --> 00:12:44,596
Are you here for the lesson too?

193
00:12:45,236 --> 00:12:47,356
The Luo's Residence is renowned
for its knowledge.

194
00:12:47,596 --> 00:12:49,955
Sir Qiu's fame crowns the capital.

195
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:51,955
Since I'll be staying for a few days,

196
00:12:52,035 --> 00:12:54,276
I shouldn't miss out on this chance.

197
00:12:56,955 --> 00:12:58,516
Are all men of the Luo's Residence

198
00:12:58,636 --> 00:13:00,315
so hardworking?

199
00:13:09,028 --> 00:13:10,668
(Ten Tactics of Warfare)

200
00:13:10,835 --> 00:13:13,276
Shanyuan, are you interested
in military tactics?

201
00:13:14,276 --> 00:13:16,156
Do you enjoy studying
military tactics too?

202
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:17,675
Serving and defending the nation

203
00:13:17,795 --> 00:13:19,276
is the best display of manhood.

204
00:13:20,996 --> 00:13:21,795
It's a shame

205
00:13:21,872 --> 00:13:23,470
my mother won't let me
learn martial arts.

206
00:13:23,488 --> 00:13:24,830
She only wants me to score the exam.

207
00:13:25,756 --> 00:13:27,756
Is it because of the dying wish

208
00:13:27,955 --> 00:13:29,276
of Old Master Luo?

209
00:13:29,396 --> 00:13:31,276
His literary work

210
00:13:31,356 --> 00:13:32,756
was held in high regard.

211
00:13:32,876 --> 00:13:34,915
Perhaps it's the reason
he wished the descendants

212
00:13:35,035 --> 00:13:36,795
could make a name for themselves
the same way.

213
00:13:37,116 --> 00:13:38,195
When he passed away,

214
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:39,636
only my grandma was with him.

215
00:13:40,035 --> 00:13:41,715
My grandma never mentioned

216
00:13:41,795 --> 00:13:42,996
any dying wish.

217
00:13:43,675 --> 00:13:44,675
Perhaps this is

218
00:13:44,715 --> 00:13:45,876
her wishful thinking all along.

219
00:13:47,795 --> 00:13:49,795
You are the legitimate son
of the principal wife.

220
00:13:49,955 --> 00:13:52,035
Old Madam Luo must favor you
over everyone else.

221
00:13:52,396 --> 00:13:54,876
Maybe she simply doesn't want you
on the battlefield.

222
00:13:57,476 --> 00:13:58,835
To my grandma,

223
00:13:59,396 --> 00:14:00,476
Luo Yining is more important

224
00:14:00,555 --> 00:14:02,596
than all of us siblings combined.

225
00:14:03,236 --> 00:14:04,195
Seventh Lady?

226
00:14:06,756 --> 00:14:08,035
What makes her

227
00:14:08,156 --> 00:14:09,555
so remarkable?

228
00:14:09,636 --> 00:14:11,236
Nothing remarkable.

229
00:14:11,555 --> 00:14:13,996
She knows how to be clingy

230
00:14:14,876 --> 00:14:16,396
and please my grandma.

231
00:14:29,876 --> 00:14:31,795
You must be

232
00:14:32,075 --> 00:14:33,795
the Third Young Master.

233
00:14:37,915 --> 00:14:38,795
Cheng Lang.

234
00:14:39,555 --> 00:14:42,636
This is Madam Lin's younger brother.

235
00:14:43,156 --> 00:14:45,476
It's my Uncle Lin Mao.

236
00:14:46,955 --> 00:14:47,996
My apologies.

237
00:14:51,195 --> 00:14:51,915
Who was that?

238
00:14:52,476 --> 00:14:53,596
No idea.

239
00:14:54,715 --> 00:14:55,516
So,

240
00:14:55,636 --> 00:14:58,035
is Third Young Master
attending the lesson?

241
00:15:00,315 --> 00:15:01,795
He is not worthy to be here.

242
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:16,795
Seventh Lady.

243
00:15:17,435 --> 00:15:18,396
Young Master Cheng.

244
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,596
Where are you headed?

245
00:15:20,715 --> 00:15:22,555
I am going to visit my grandma.

246
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:23,435
I am

247
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:25,035
also headed there to greet her.

248
00:15:25,156 --> 00:15:26,195
Shall we go together?

249
00:15:26,715 --> 00:15:27,315
Please.

250
00:15:31,996 --> 00:15:33,156
I notice

251
00:15:33,276 --> 00:15:34,396
that you visit Old Madam Luo

252
00:15:34,476 --> 00:15:35,675
several times a day.

253
00:15:36,516 --> 00:15:37,876
You are truly

254
00:15:37,996 --> 00:15:39,315
a filial granddaughter.

255
00:15:39,955 --> 00:15:41,636
I grew up without a mother.

256
00:15:41,915 --> 00:15:43,636
My grandma raised me.

257
00:15:44,075 --> 00:15:45,075
It's natural

258
00:15:45,156 --> 00:15:46,835
that we are closer.

259
00:15:47,075 --> 00:15:48,476
Mind the stairs.

260
00:15:50,435 --> 00:15:52,555
Much appreciated, Young Master Cheng.

261
00:15:53,835 --> 00:15:55,276
Yining is acting so intimately

262
00:15:55,396 --> 00:15:55,955
with a man.

263
00:15:56,035 --> 00:15:57,035
This is unacceptable.

264
00:15:57,116 --> 00:15:58,596
Grandma is not fond of him.

265
00:15:58,715 --> 00:15:59,596
She will never agree

266
00:15:59,636 --> 00:16:00,835
to let them see each other.

267
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:02,116
You have nothing to worry about.

268
00:16:02,156 --> 00:16:03,075
She wouldn't let Mother

269
00:16:03,156 --> 00:16:04,435
mention Young Master Cheng.

270
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:06,236
Are you sure she's not fond of him?

271
00:16:07,596 --> 00:16:09,276
Are you saying the Grandma disagrees

272
00:16:09,356 --> 00:16:10,636
so you wouldn't be

273
00:16:10,715 --> 00:16:12,035
Yining's competitor?

274
00:16:12,715 --> 00:16:13,955
You can't be serious.

275
00:16:14,315 --> 00:16:16,596
I'm tired. Let's head back now.

276
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,588
(Haitang Abode)

277
00:16:21,636 --> 00:16:22,315
Young Lady.

278
00:16:22,435 --> 00:16:23,396
Young Master Cheng almost

279
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:24,555
gave me a heart attack.

280
00:16:24,636 --> 00:16:25,715
What was that about?

281
00:16:25,795 --> 00:16:27,835
Does he have feelings for you?

282
00:16:28,276 --> 00:16:29,356
Nonsense.

283
00:16:29,596 --> 00:16:31,116
He is not a righteous person.

284
00:16:31,356 --> 00:16:32,116
I think

285
00:16:32,236 --> 00:16:33,636
he is probing around.

286
00:16:33,795 --> 00:16:35,075
Probing for what?

287
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:40,116
Welcome back.

288
00:16:40,555 --> 00:16:42,835
Third Young Master sent the flowers.

289
00:16:43,996 --> 00:16:44,996
Leave it here.

290
00:16:45,156 --> 00:16:46,715
I'll use them for my florist art.

291
00:16:48,035 --> 00:16:49,356
Dismissed.

292
00:16:49,835 --> 00:16:50,675
Yes.

293
00:17:25,596 --> 00:17:26,836
Stop standing there.

294
00:17:27,235 --> 00:17:28,435
Why don't you join me?

295
00:17:35,036 --> 00:17:37,275
Third Brother, your handwriting is great.

296
00:17:38,396 --> 00:17:40,316
It'd be even better

297
00:17:40,396 --> 00:17:41,715
if the others

298
00:17:41,836 --> 00:17:42,836
could see this.

299
00:17:43,596 --> 00:17:44,836
I don't care much about

300
00:17:44,955 --> 00:17:45,836
what the others think.

301
00:17:49,316 --> 00:17:52,755
Are you writing an article?

302
00:17:53,195 --> 00:17:54,396
I came at a bad time.

303
00:17:54,876 --> 00:17:56,235
Sorry for disturbing you.

304
00:17:56,755 --> 00:17:57,715
I didn't expect you

305
00:17:57,836 --> 00:17:59,036
to understand this article.

306
00:17:59,596 --> 00:18:01,715
When I was in the side yard,

307
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:03,755
Grandma hired a female teacher

308
00:18:03,836 --> 00:18:05,596
to teach me how to read and write.

309
00:18:05,915 --> 00:18:07,275
I was curious to learn more.

310
00:18:07,396 --> 00:18:08,636
So, I asked.

311
00:18:11,836 --> 00:18:12,995
Third Brother,

312
00:18:13,356 --> 00:18:15,755
have you thought about
attending the Imperial Examination?

313
00:18:27,316 --> 00:18:29,235
How may I assist you?

314
00:18:33,995 --> 00:18:36,876
Cheng Lang has been acting strange
ever since he came.

315
00:18:36,995 --> 00:18:38,156
I think

316
00:18:38,316 --> 00:18:39,915
he has an ulterior motive.

317
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:41,755
Indeed.

318
00:18:42,596 --> 00:18:45,036
Do you know what he's seeking

319
00:18:45,116 --> 00:18:46,515
in our home?

320
00:18:56,156 --> 00:18:58,156
Could you tell me

321
00:18:58,475 --> 00:18:59,715
if he will hurt Grandma

322
00:18:59,836 --> 00:19:01,356
and the others?

323
00:19:02,715 --> 00:19:03,755
I assure you

324
00:19:04,195 --> 00:19:05,836
I won't allow that.

325
00:19:08,715 --> 00:19:10,036
It's a relief

326
00:19:10,316 --> 00:19:11,596
to hear you say that.

327
00:19:44,076 --> 00:19:44,796
Who's there?

328
00:19:50,556 --> 00:19:51,316
Old Madam,

329
00:19:51,435 --> 00:19:53,116
there is a man in black lurking about.

330
00:19:54,515 --> 00:19:55,955
A man in black?

331
00:19:56,435 --> 00:19:57,515
Butler Bai says

332
00:19:57,636 --> 00:19:58,596
he spotted someone

333
00:19:58,715 --> 00:19:59,636
in the guest room.

334
00:19:59,836 --> 00:20:01,316
Young Master Cheng is our guest.

335
00:20:01,435 --> 00:20:03,076
He couldn't search the room.

336
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:04,876
Does Second Master know?

337
00:20:05,316 --> 00:20:06,995
Butler Bai came to Muxi Hall first

338
00:20:07,076 --> 00:20:07,915
to report it.

339
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:13,556
My fear

340
00:20:13,915 --> 00:20:15,915
has come true.

341
00:20:24,235 --> 00:20:25,715
Do you think

342
00:20:25,836 --> 00:20:27,396
Young Master Cheng came here

343
00:20:27,556 --> 00:20:30,036
for that document?

344
00:20:30,156 --> 00:20:33,396
Cheng Lang is Lu Jiaxue's nephew.

345
00:20:34,396 --> 00:20:36,235
I know very well

346
00:20:36,475 --> 00:20:39,515
how Lu Jiaxue

347
00:20:39,675 --> 00:20:41,995
achieved a meteoric rise in his career.

348
00:20:42,435 --> 00:20:46,435
Cheng Lang's sudden visit today

349
00:20:48,116 --> 00:20:50,235
raised some suspicion for me.

350
00:20:54,116 --> 00:20:56,076
Wenzhai. Oh, Wenzhai.

351
00:20:56,356 --> 00:20:59,156
How am I supposed
to overcome the predicament

352
00:20:59,915 --> 00:21:01,955
you left me with?

353
00:21:06,235 --> 00:21:08,235
Old Master lived a righteous life.

354
00:21:08,715 --> 00:21:09,636
It was that quality

355
00:21:09,876 --> 00:21:12,316
that earned your faith in him.

356
00:21:13,955 --> 00:21:16,195
Tell Butler Bai not to spread the word.

357
00:21:17,036 --> 00:21:18,995
Keep an eye on the surroundings.

358
00:21:20,235 --> 00:21:21,036
Yes.

359
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,466
(Luo's Residence)

360
00:21:31,755 --> 00:21:33,356
According to Mistress Qiao,

361
00:21:33,636 --> 00:21:34,995
Young Master Cheng

362
00:21:35,116 --> 00:21:36,435
is any young girl's

363
00:21:36,556 --> 00:21:38,235
most sought-after future husband.

364
00:21:38,356 --> 00:21:39,435
People have been eyeing him

365
00:21:39,556 --> 00:21:41,836
as soon as he arrived in the capital.

366
00:21:42,036 --> 00:21:42,915
On top of that,

367
00:21:43,036 --> 00:21:45,396
Marquis Lu has high expectations

368
00:21:45,515 --> 00:21:46,556
for his nephew.

369
00:21:46,675 --> 00:21:48,435
Plenty of people can't wait
to curry favors

370
00:21:48,596 --> 00:21:50,036
with Marquis Lu through him.

371
00:21:52,755 --> 00:21:55,596
In terms of background
and level of talent,

372
00:21:55,796 --> 00:21:56,915
Young Master Liu

373
00:21:56,995 --> 00:21:59,235
is definitely overshadowed.

374
00:22:01,435 --> 00:22:02,995
A woman's marriage is usually

375
00:22:03,076 --> 00:22:03,715
the decision

376
00:22:03,836 --> 00:22:05,195
of the family elders.

377
00:22:05,556 --> 00:22:07,076
Even if I say no to this,

378
00:22:07,195 --> 00:22:08,715
there's nothing I can do.

379
00:22:08,796 --> 00:22:10,036
I think you deserve better,

380
00:22:10,076 --> 00:22:11,475
Yiyu.

381
00:22:11,596 --> 00:22:14,675
I can't shake the feeling...

382
00:22:15,076 --> 00:22:16,275
I can't shake the feeling

383
00:22:16,356 --> 00:22:18,396
that you two get along just fine.

384
00:22:19,116 --> 00:22:20,515
Mind your words.

385
00:22:22,915 --> 00:22:24,836
What makes you think so?

386
00:22:26,076 --> 00:22:27,275
Don't be silly.

387
00:22:27,435 --> 00:22:28,755
Marquis Anbei can get

388
00:22:28,836 --> 00:22:30,036
all the teachers

389
00:22:30,116 --> 00:22:30,836
he needs.

390
00:22:30,915 --> 00:22:33,116
Why must he come to our residence
for the lessons?

391
00:22:33,675 --> 00:22:35,636
Even if our grandma knew

392
00:22:35,715 --> 00:22:36,675
his family elder,

393
00:22:36,876 --> 00:22:37,915
we had never seen

394
00:22:38,036 --> 00:22:38,876
any of the grandsons

395
00:22:38,995 --> 00:22:41,515
visiting us over the years.

396
00:22:41,915 --> 00:22:43,195
It doesn't seem natural.

397
00:22:44,915 --> 00:22:46,475
I think...

398
00:22:46,556 --> 00:22:47,636
What is it?

399
00:22:48,755 --> 00:22:49,715
Maybe he is here

400
00:22:49,915 --> 00:22:52,636
because you two shared a past?

401
00:22:55,076 --> 00:22:56,915
Don't be ridiculous.

402
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:02,036
Young Master Cheng is here.

403
00:23:02,396 --> 00:23:03,235
I must get going.

404
00:23:11,275 --> 00:23:11,876
Dismissed.

405
00:23:11,995 --> 00:23:12,596
Yes.

406
00:23:17,995 --> 00:23:19,596
You look immersed.

407
00:23:23,036 --> 00:23:24,636
First Lady was too clumsy.

408
00:23:24,681 --> 00:23:26,082
How could Fifth Lady just leave?

409
00:23:26,275 --> 00:23:27,755
People will get the wrong idea

410
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,239
if they are seen alone.

411
00:23:30,156 --> 00:23:31,316
Young Master Cheng

412
00:23:31,435 --> 00:23:32,636
would go to great lengths

413
00:23:32,755 --> 00:23:33,715
to accomplish his goal.

414
00:23:34,755 --> 00:23:35,955
Is there a deity living inside

415
00:23:36,475 --> 00:23:38,235
the flower bud?

416
00:23:39,356 --> 00:23:41,356
But you startled me.

417
00:23:41,475 --> 00:23:42,955
The flower fell into the water.

418
00:23:43,036 --> 00:23:44,636
I doubt the deity will talk to me again.

419
00:23:44,755 --> 00:23:46,396
Then, I've made a terrible mistake.

420
00:23:46,876 --> 00:23:48,235
How do I make it up to you?

421
00:23:58,796 --> 00:23:59,715
Inform the staff

422
00:23:59,796 --> 00:24:00,675
in the courtyard

423
00:24:00,755 --> 00:24:02,755
to be more mindful of their words

424
00:24:02,876 --> 00:24:04,435
and actions.

425
00:24:04,675 --> 00:24:06,195
If anyone asks anything,

426
00:24:06,316 --> 00:24:07,596
they must say nothing.

427
00:24:07,796 --> 00:24:08,515
Understood.

428
00:24:08,796 --> 00:24:09,836
Yining.

429
00:24:12,955 --> 00:24:14,356
Are you here

430
00:24:14,475 --> 00:24:15,435
to admire the lotuses?

431
00:24:15,636 --> 00:24:17,036
Or perhaps

432
00:24:18,156 --> 00:24:19,356
you came here

433
00:24:19,435 --> 00:24:21,275
knowing Young Master Cheng has been

434
00:24:21,396 --> 00:24:22,836
visiting the pond?

435
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:24,195
How do you know

436
00:24:24,316 --> 00:24:25,915
Young Master Cheng comes here

437
00:24:25,995 --> 00:24:27,515
to admire the flowers?

438
00:24:30,076 --> 00:24:31,796
I must visit Grandma.

439
00:24:31,995 --> 00:24:33,195
You must excuse me.

440
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:47,836
Come.

441
00:24:48,116 --> 00:24:49,796
Is it going to work?

442
00:24:49,876 --> 00:24:51,076
Have some faith in me.

443
00:24:51,556 --> 00:24:52,836
With good digestion,

444
00:24:52,955 --> 00:24:54,271
you can digest anything.

445
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:55,680
You're going to lose weight for sure.

446
00:24:56,475 --> 00:24:57,076
Try it out.

447
00:25:04,356 --> 00:25:05,036
Let's go.

448
00:25:06,475 --> 00:25:07,356
Come here.

449
00:25:13,475 --> 00:25:14,235
Yilian has been

450
00:25:14,356 --> 00:25:15,715
visiting Yiyu a lot lately.

451
00:25:15,796 --> 00:25:17,076
I wonder what they talk about.

452
00:25:19,876 --> 00:25:20,675
Yiyu...

453
00:25:23,796 --> 00:25:24,515
Yiyu.

454
00:25:26,116 --> 00:25:27,036
Yixiu.

455
00:25:27,636 --> 00:25:29,515
What are you doing in the kitchen
at this hour?

456
00:25:29,675 --> 00:25:30,356
Nothing.

457
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:31,150
Just taking a walk.

458
00:25:31,275 --> 00:25:32,475
Mother wants me to walk more.

459
00:25:32,556 --> 00:25:33,876
Don't steal from the kitchen.

460
00:25:33,995 --> 00:25:34,995
Yes.

461
00:25:35,836 --> 00:25:36,316
Let's go.

462
00:25:40,528 --> 00:25:41,430
How are you so strong?

463
00:25:41,556 --> 00:25:42,156
Are you hurt?

464
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:43,110
You need to go on a diet.

465
00:25:43,235 --> 00:25:43,995
Come up.

466
00:25:45,796 --> 00:25:47,356
Is it wrong for a girl to be chubby?

467
00:25:47,515 --> 00:25:48,116
Yining says

468
00:25:48,235 --> 00:25:49,076
it's all right

469
00:25:49,195 --> 00:25:50,116
as long as I am healthy.

470
00:25:50,356 --> 00:25:51,316
She does

471
00:25:51,396 --> 00:25:52,556
make a good point.

472
00:25:52,715 --> 00:25:53,435
Good health

473
00:25:53,515 --> 00:25:55,036
is the basis of a proper life.

474
00:25:55,116 --> 00:25:55,836
However,

475
00:25:55,955 --> 00:25:57,755
you may be chubby,

476
00:25:58,116 --> 00:26:00,435
you are somewhat

477
00:26:00,556 --> 00:26:01,435
adorable.

478
00:26:01,556 --> 00:26:02,356
What do you mean

479
00:26:02,715 --> 00:26:04,796
"somewhat adorable"?

480
00:26:04,995 --> 00:26:06,475
All right, I must go now.

481
00:26:06,596 --> 00:26:07,515
Finish the medicine.

482
00:26:10,156 --> 00:26:12,116
Fine. I'll drink it.

483
00:26:15,915 --> 00:26:18,235
Is this adequate?

484
00:26:18,396 --> 00:26:19,995
Don't worry, Yiyu.

485
00:26:20,076 --> 00:26:21,316
It's well hidden.

486
00:26:21,396 --> 00:26:23,036
No one will ever find out.

487
00:26:23,796 --> 00:26:26,275
We can't stop Grandma
from favoring Yining.

488
00:26:26,356 --> 00:26:28,116
You are on your own.

489
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:46,356
Did you have another nightmare?

490
00:26:46,836 --> 00:26:48,475
You've been having nightmares

491
00:26:48,596 --> 00:26:49,995
ever since you fell into the water.

492
00:26:50,116 --> 00:26:51,036
Qing Qu's treatment

493
00:26:51,156 --> 00:26:51,836
improved

494
00:26:51,915 --> 00:26:52,876
the condition.

495
00:26:52,955 --> 00:26:53,636
Why are you

496
00:26:53,755 --> 00:26:55,275
having more nightmares lately?

497
00:26:56,995 --> 00:26:57,796
I'm all right.

498
00:26:58,356 --> 00:26:59,596
When Qing Qu is back,

499
00:26:59,715 --> 00:27:01,515
I'll get better after having

500
00:27:01,636 --> 00:27:03,156
some tranquilizing decoction.

501
00:27:03,915 --> 00:27:05,156
Yining! Yining!

502
00:27:05,435 --> 00:27:06,515
Where is the box

503
00:27:06,636 --> 00:27:07,596
I hid at your place?

504
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:09,195
Calm down.

505
00:27:09,316 --> 00:27:10,596
I hid it in my study.

506
00:27:11,235 --> 00:27:12,636
Xue Zhi, bring it here.

507
00:27:13,316 --> 00:27:13,915
You know what?

508
00:27:13,995 --> 00:27:15,396
My mother was invited by Madam Liu

509
00:27:15,515 --> 00:27:16,396
to watch an opera.

510
00:27:16,515 --> 00:27:17,876
This is my golden opportunity

511
00:27:17,955 --> 00:27:18,955
to have a decent meal.

512
00:27:19,036 --> 00:27:20,596
Young Lady, you can't eat too much.

513
00:27:20,715 --> 00:27:21,475
Madam Chen

514
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,750
will get your measurements again.

515
00:27:22,876 --> 00:27:24,515
It's all right. I have a solution.

516
00:27:25,316 --> 00:27:27,275
The lotus leaves look healthy.

517
00:27:27,296 --> 00:27:28,800
Have the servants
get a few lotus leaves.

518
00:27:28,836 --> 00:27:30,915
We'll have sticky rice chicken tonight.

519
00:27:31,435 --> 00:27:33,076
Yining, join us.

520
00:27:34,675 --> 00:27:35,915
I have to check the ledger.

521
00:27:36,036 --> 00:27:36,955
Forget the ledger.

522
00:27:37,116 --> 00:27:38,790
Food is the people's top priority.

523
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:39,483
Let's go.

524
00:27:44,195 --> 00:27:46,036
The lotuses are growing well.

525
00:27:54,995 --> 00:27:55,796
Young Lady.

526
00:27:55,995 --> 00:27:56,955
At ease.

527
00:27:58,156 --> 00:27:59,715
Who do you serve?

528
00:27:59,796 --> 00:28:00,915
Why do you need the lotuses?

529
00:28:01,036 --> 00:28:01,715
Sixth Lady,

530
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,870
we were ordered by Madam Chen

531
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:04,620
to deliver these
to Second Young Master Cheng.

532
00:28:04,656 --> 00:28:05,430
She says

533
00:28:05,515 --> 00:28:06,755
the usual flowers are too corny.

534
00:28:06,876 --> 00:28:07,955
She ordered us to

535
00:28:08,076 --> 00:28:09,796
deliver the lotuses to his room.

536
00:28:10,316 --> 00:28:11,556
Very well. Go ahead.

537
00:28:12,556 --> 00:28:13,316
Hold on.

538
00:28:15,156 --> 00:28:16,755
Why would Young Master Cheng's room

539
00:28:16,876 --> 00:28:18,515
need so many lotuses?

540
00:28:18,636 --> 00:28:20,275
There isn't a pond in his room.

541
00:28:20,396 --> 00:28:21,475
There isn't enough space.

542
00:28:21,755 --> 00:28:23,995
Some were requested by First Lady.

543
00:28:25,316 --> 00:28:26,275
When did Yiyu become

544
00:28:26,396 --> 00:28:27,435
interested in lotuses?

545
00:28:27,755 --> 00:28:28,995
We have no idea.

546
00:28:36,275 --> 00:28:36,876
Xue Zhi.

547
00:28:37,356 --> 00:28:38,435
Get that leaf for me.

548
00:28:38,596 --> 00:28:39,515
See? The biggest one.

549
00:28:39,636 --> 00:28:41,836
I bet it will make the sticky
rice chicken delicious.

550
00:28:41,876 --> 00:28:42,435
Yes.

551
00:28:46,396 --> 00:28:48,156
You look troubled.

552
00:28:48,235 --> 00:28:49,475
Are you not feeling well?

553
00:28:50,475 --> 00:28:52,275
Indeed. I feel a bit under the wind.

554
00:28:52,396 --> 00:28:54,076
I should head back to my room.

555
00:28:54,596 --> 00:28:56,636
You're like a sick kitten.

556
00:28:56,915 --> 00:28:57,316
All right.

557
00:28:57,515 --> 00:28:59,116
Xue Zhi, escort her back.

558
00:28:59,235 --> 00:28:59,796
I can

559
00:28:59,876 --> 00:29:00,955
get the leaf myself.

560
00:29:02,675 --> 00:29:04,076
I'm heading back now.

561
00:29:04,836 --> 00:29:05,515
Go on.

562
00:29:09,836 --> 00:29:10,556
Xue Zhi.

563
00:29:10,876 --> 00:29:12,316
I want some lotus buds too.

564
00:29:12,515 --> 00:29:14,675
However, don't get them yourself.

565
00:29:14,915 --> 00:29:16,156
I noticed

566
00:29:16,275 --> 00:29:18,356
the other maids did a great job
plucking the buds.

567
00:29:18,596 --> 00:29:18,955
When Yiyu

568
00:29:19,116 --> 00:29:20,396
leaves the courtyard,

569
00:29:20,515 --> 00:29:22,316
get one lotus bud from them.

570
00:29:22,435 --> 00:29:24,235
But aren't all the flowers

571
00:29:24,316 --> 00:29:25,396
the same?

572
00:29:25,408 --> 00:29:26,150
Why would you take

573
00:29:26,275 --> 00:29:27,356
one that has been picked?

574
00:29:27,636 --> 00:29:28,556
I think

575
00:29:28,636 --> 00:29:30,156
Yiyu has other plans

576
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:31,275
for the flower buds.

577
00:29:31,356 --> 00:29:32,156
Go on.

578
00:29:32,275 --> 00:29:33,356
We'll find out soon.

579
00:29:33,515 --> 00:29:34,275
Yes.

580
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,806
(Haitang Abode)

581
00:29:39,515 --> 00:29:40,195
Young Lady.

582
00:29:40,435 --> 00:29:41,915
Should I get some mung bean soup

583
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,320
from the kitchen?

584
00:29:43,475 --> 00:29:44,915
It should keep you refreshed.

585
00:29:45,675 --> 00:29:46,275
Sure.

586
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,360
(February 27, payment of account,
five bolts of cloth)

587
00:30:03,396 --> 00:30:04,116
Young Lady,

588
00:30:04,275 --> 00:30:06,275
this is the flower bud I secretly took

589
00:30:06,396 --> 00:30:07,556
from First Lady.

590
00:30:14,955 --> 00:30:16,396
What are you looking for?

591
00:30:27,915 --> 00:30:29,995
Young Lady, why are you taking apart

592
00:30:30,076 --> 00:30:31,235
the nice flower bud?

593
00:30:36,235 --> 00:30:37,876
I never put anything in the bud

594
00:30:37,995 --> 00:30:38,915
after I took it.

595
00:30:39,076 --> 00:30:40,036
Why is there a note

596
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,841
inside the flower bud?

597
00:30:42,356 --> 00:30:44,955
"Inside the dice,
the red bean is placed."

598
00:30:45,076 --> 00:30:47,316
"I wonder if you know
this intense yearning in my bones?"

599
00:30:47,715 --> 00:30:49,796
I knew something was amiss
when Yiyu asked

600
00:30:49,876 --> 00:30:51,116
for lotus buds.

601
00:30:51,396 --> 00:30:52,235
I didn't think

602
00:30:52,356 --> 00:30:53,556
she'd be as bold

603
00:30:53,796 --> 00:30:55,156
as to send love poems

604
00:30:55,275 --> 00:30:56,556
like in those romance novels.

605
00:30:56,675 --> 00:30:57,796
It is wrong.

606
00:30:57,915 --> 00:30:59,235
How could she have done this?

607
00:30:59,280 --> 00:30:59,830
There will soon

608
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,232
be an engagement with the Liu family.

609
00:31:01,396 --> 00:31:01,836
Young Lady,

610
00:31:01,915 --> 00:31:03,556
we should inform Old Madam.

611
00:31:03,675 --> 00:31:04,596
If I were the one

612
00:31:04,715 --> 00:31:06,076
to tell Grandma,

613
00:31:06,235 --> 00:31:08,275
Yiyu would hold a grudge against me.

614
00:31:08,435 --> 00:31:10,036
If I don't tell Grandma,

615
00:31:10,156 --> 00:31:11,475
who knows what trouble

616
00:31:11,596 --> 00:31:13,356
Yiyu might get herself into,
given her temper?

617
00:31:19,316 --> 00:31:20,396
We must keep this

618
00:31:20,515 --> 00:31:21,435
between us.

619
00:31:21,556 --> 00:31:22,955
No one else can find out.

620
00:31:24,036 --> 00:31:25,475
Forget ever seeing

621
00:31:25,955 --> 00:31:27,475
this note.

622
00:31:29,235 --> 00:31:29,955
Young Lady,

623
00:31:30,076 --> 00:31:31,675
should we really ignore this?

624
00:31:31,796 --> 00:31:33,556
What if people find out?

625
00:31:33,796 --> 00:31:36,275
I don't want Grandma to be worried.

626
00:31:37,556 --> 00:31:38,556
Besides,

627
00:31:38,636 --> 00:31:39,515
it's best

628
00:31:39,636 --> 00:31:40,715
to stop Yiyu

629
00:31:40,876 --> 00:31:42,195
without Grandma

630
00:31:42,316 --> 00:31:43,515
ever learning about this.

631
00:31:43,596 --> 00:31:45,356
Yiyu is not a vile person.

632
00:31:45,475 --> 00:31:47,316
She is merely being used

633
00:31:47,435 --> 00:31:48,556
unknowingly.

634
00:31:48,675 --> 00:31:50,356
You know how she treats you.

635
00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:51,836
Are you still going to help her?

636
00:31:52,275 --> 00:31:54,235
I don't want Grandma to be worried.

637
00:31:54,435 --> 00:31:55,715
If anything goes south,

638
00:31:55,876 --> 00:31:57,435
Yiyu won't be the only one affected.

639
00:31:57,556 --> 00:31:59,275
All the unmarried maidens
of the Luo family

640
00:31:59,435 --> 00:32:00,796
will have a tarnished reputation.

641
00:32:10,475 --> 00:32:11,195
Well?

642
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:11,760
Young Lady,

643
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,568
this is Second
Young Master Cheng's response.

644
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,496
(Your radiant robe emanates
the elegance of jade.)

645
00:32:20,475 --> 00:32:23,275
He likes my outfit.

646
00:32:25,036 --> 00:32:26,715
Bring me the ink and brush.

647
00:32:27,876 --> 00:32:28,755
Young Lady,

648
00:32:28,876 --> 00:32:30,556
it's best we stop writing the letters.

649
00:32:30,836 --> 00:32:32,675
If Madam Chen finds out,

650
00:32:32,704 --> 00:32:34,624
a death sentence
will be the least of my worries.

651
00:32:34,715 --> 00:32:36,076
Besides, Second Young Master Cheng

652
00:32:36,195 --> 00:32:36,796
isn't really

653
00:32:36,876 --> 00:32:38,076
going to marry you.

654
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:39,156
After all,

655
00:32:39,275 --> 00:32:41,116
you are meant to marry Young Master Liu.

656
00:32:41,995 --> 00:32:43,396
I don't get it.

657
00:32:43,515 --> 00:32:43,955
My parents

658
00:32:44,076 --> 00:32:45,435
insist on me marrying him.

659
00:32:45,556 --> 00:32:47,836
I am the best in terms
of talents, beauty,

660
00:32:48,076 --> 00:32:49,636
and bearing.

661
00:32:49,755 --> 00:32:50,796
Cheng Lang and I

662
00:32:50,915 --> 00:32:52,715
are the match made in heaven.

663
00:32:52,836 --> 00:32:53,995
Besides,

664
00:32:54,316 --> 00:32:55,435
it's not like

665
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:56,715
he's not interested in me.

666
00:32:56,955 --> 00:32:57,836
Otherwise,

667
00:32:57,955 --> 00:32:59,836
why would he answer my letters?

668
00:33:00,195 --> 00:33:00,675
In any case,

669
00:33:00,796 --> 00:33:01,836
stay out of this.

670
00:33:02,116 --> 00:33:03,796
Keep this between the three of us.

671
00:33:04,036 --> 00:33:05,596
No one else must know.

672
00:33:05,796 --> 00:33:06,755
Is that clear?

673
00:33:07,596 --> 00:33:08,076
But...

674
00:33:08,156 --> 00:33:10,156
Enough. Bring me the brush.

675
00:33:10,636 --> 00:33:11,356
Yes.

676
00:33:29,915 --> 00:33:30,515
Young Master.

677
00:33:31,316 --> 00:33:32,836
Luo Yiyu is bold enough

678
00:33:32,955 --> 00:33:34,396
to send you secret love letters.

679
00:33:35,116 --> 00:33:36,156
It seems she is truly

680
00:33:36,235 --> 00:33:37,076
in love with you.

681
00:33:37,596 --> 00:33:39,356
Have you ever learned anything useful

682
00:33:39,435 --> 00:33:40,556
from her?

683
00:33:40,755 --> 00:33:41,596
She told me

684
00:33:42,636 --> 00:33:44,396
Old Master Luo

685
00:33:44,755 --> 00:33:45,995
spent the most time

686
00:33:46,116 --> 00:33:47,195
in Yixin Abode.

687
00:33:47,396 --> 00:33:48,596
After he passed away,

688
00:33:49,356 --> 00:33:51,396
Yixin Abode was never repurposed.

689
00:33:52,076 --> 00:33:53,836
Old Madam Luo often

690
00:33:53,915 --> 00:33:54,955
goes there alone.

691
00:33:55,715 --> 00:33:57,116
Does that mean the testimony

692
00:33:57,435 --> 00:33:59,076
is hidden in Yixin Abode?

693
00:34:01,116 --> 00:34:02,156
It's possible.

694
00:34:02,556 --> 00:34:04,076
We'll sneak in and search the place.

695
00:34:07,955 --> 00:34:09,355
Luo Yiyu may be

696
00:34:10,315 --> 00:34:12,156
the legitimate daughter
of the first wife,

697
00:34:12,275 --> 00:34:13,791
but she is not as favored

698
00:34:13,792 --> 00:34:14,870
as the second wife's daughter

699
00:34:14,956 --> 00:34:16,476
by Old Madam Luo.

700
00:34:17,195 --> 00:34:19,636
Luo Yiyu doesn't know much.

701
00:34:19,916 --> 00:34:21,636
We can't learn more from her.

702
00:34:24,355 --> 00:34:26,195
Get rid of these flowers.

703
00:34:26,516 --> 00:34:27,116
Yes.

704
00:34:37,795 --> 00:34:39,996
When is Cheng Lang coming out?

705
00:34:40,315 --> 00:34:41,116
Yiyu.

706
00:34:41,355 --> 00:34:42,795
What are you staring at?

707
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:47,875
Yining? What are you doing here?

708
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:49,996
What are you looking for here,

709
00:34:50,116 --> 00:34:51,036
Yining?

710
00:34:53,395 --> 00:34:55,036
Out of all our siblings,

711
00:34:55,156 --> 00:34:56,195
you are the best

712
00:34:56,476 --> 00:34:58,076
at needlework.

713
00:34:59,275 --> 00:35:00,476
This lotus embroidery

714
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:02,275
is remarkable and lifelike.

715
00:35:03,195 --> 00:35:05,675
Why not add a poem on it?

716
00:35:05,996 --> 00:35:07,275
I have an idea.

717
00:35:07,395 --> 00:35:09,355
"Inside the dice,
the red bean is placed."

718
00:35:09,472 --> 00:35:11,550
"I wonder if you know
this intense yearning in my bones?"

719
00:35:11,835 --> 00:35:12,795
How about that?

720
00:35:13,395 --> 00:35:15,195
Don't you like it?

721
00:35:15,636 --> 00:35:17,195
I quite like it.

722
00:35:17,436 --> 00:35:19,395
It sounds very smooth.

723
00:35:23,636 --> 00:35:24,715
However,

724
00:35:24,795 --> 00:35:26,516
yearning won't make a difference.

725
00:35:29,875 --> 00:35:31,596
You're lucky I found it.

726
00:35:31,875 --> 00:35:33,875
Who knows what might happen

727
00:35:33,996 --> 00:35:34,996
if it's someone else?

728
00:35:35,715 --> 00:35:37,076
How did you find out?

729
00:35:37,195 --> 00:35:38,875
I'm doing this for your own good.

730
00:35:38,996 --> 00:35:39,476
You...

731
00:35:40,195 --> 00:35:41,835
Are you in love with Cheng Lang too?

732
00:35:41,916 --> 00:35:43,476
Is that why you're coming after me?

733
00:35:44,675 --> 00:35:47,036
I barely know him.

734
00:35:47,235 --> 00:35:48,755
I barely talked.

735
00:35:48,916 --> 00:35:50,235
Be careful with your words.

736
00:35:54,675 --> 00:35:56,355
Do you really think

737
00:35:56,476 --> 00:35:58,556
Cheng Lang is worthy of your love?

738
00:36:00,156 --> 00:36:01,875
What do you mean?

739
00:36:03,275 --> 00:36:04,636
Young Master Cheng

740
00:36:04,835 --> 00:36:06,076
ordered his servants

741
00:36:06,195 --> 00:36:07,076
to get rid of this.

742
00:36:07,195 --> 00:36:09,156
But I saw it and retrieved it.

743
00:36:09,315 --> 00:36:11,036
You can't afford to let the others

744
00:36:11,156 --> 00:36:12,076
see this.

745
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:14,516
Your mother, grandma,

746
00:36:14,636 --> 00:36:15,715
and sisters

747
00:36:15,795 --> 00:36:17,315
would all be in trouble.

748
00:36:20,875 --> 00:36:21,996
Yiyu.

749
00:36:23,315 --> 00:36:25,956
We are siblings
who share the same root.

750
00:36:26,036 --> 00:36:27,116
We thrive and fall

751
00:36:27,235 --> 00:36:28,476
as one.

752
00:36:28,596 --> 00:36:29,835
The others may not understand it,

753
00:36:29,956 --> 00:36:31,315
but how can someone as smart as you

754
00:36:31,596 --> 00:36:33,116
not see it?

755
00:36:34,996 --> 00:36:36,235
I got carried away.

756
00:36:37,436 --> 00:36:39,355
Please don't tell anyone.

757
00:36:40,956 --> 00:36:41,875
Don't worry.

758
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:43,195
Your secret

759
00:36:43,315 --> 00:36:44,715
is safe with me.

760
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:46,556
Just make sure

761
00:36:46,636 --> 00:36:48,076
you don't make the same mistake again.

762
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:58,980
(Yixin Abode)

763
00:38:30,715 --> 00:38:32,675
(Yixin Abode)
Fire! Fire!

764
00:38:35,315 --> 00:38:37,156
Xue Zhi, where is the fire?

765
00:38:37,275 --> 00:38:38,636
It's Old Master's study.

766
00:38:39,315 --> 00:38:40,916
Fetch water! Put out the fire!

767
00:38:41,036 --> 00:38:42,395
You too!

768
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:45,835
Hurry up!

769
00:38:46,156 --> 00:38:47,395
Don't just stand there!

770
00:38:47,516 --> 00:38:48,675
Get the basins and buckets!

771
00:38:48,715 --> 00:38:49,395
Yes!

772
00:38:49,436 --> 00:38:50,076
Unbelievable!

773
00:38:50,315 --> 00:38:51,116
Old Madam, careful.

774
00:38:51,795 --> 00:38:52,315
Old Madam.

775
00:38:52,436 --> 00:38:53,076
Be careful.

776
00:38:53,152 --> 00:38:53,670
Old Madam!

777
00:38:55,156 --> 00:38:55,795
Butler Bai,

778
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:57,436
what happened here?

779
00:38:57,516 --> 00:38:58,755
Why is there a fire?

780
00:38:58,875 --> 00:39:01,036
I don't know.

781
00:39:17,556 --> 00:39:18,315
Second Master!

782
00:39:19,516 --> 00:39:20,875
Mother, get to safety.

783
00:39:20,996 --> 00:39:21,715
Leave it to me.

784
00:39:21,795 --> 00:39:22,476
Safety?

785
00:39:22,596 --> 00:39:24,315
Put out the fire now!

786
00:39:24,355 --> 00:39:25,755
Butler Bai, don't just stand there!

787
00:39:25,795 --> 00:39:27,195
Get help! Put out the fire!

788
00:39:27,275 --> 00:39:27,916
Yes, sir!

789
00:39:27,956 --> 00:39:28,636
How did it happen?

790
00:39:28,675 --> 00:39:29,195
Take care.

791
00:39:29,235 --> 00:39:30,675
How did this happen?

792
00:39:35,195 --> 00:39:37,036
Who set the place ablaze?

793
00:39:37,116 --> 00:39:37,556
Father.

794
00:39:37,596 --> 00:39:38,476
Go to Haitang Abode

795
00:39:38,596 --> 00:39:39,195
for safety.

796
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:39,950
The fire is too big.

797
00:39:39,956 --> 00:39:41,116
We can't go in

798
00:39:41,116 --> 00:39:42,516
until it's put out.

799
00:39:42,636 --> 00:39:43,795
I'm not going anywhere!

800
00:39:43,916 --> 00:39:45,395
I need to see this fire put out.

801
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:46,916
I must go inside

802
00:39:47,036 --> 00:39:47,875
your grandpa's study.

803
00:39:47,956 --> 00:39:49,195
His belongings

804
00:39:49,235 --> 00:39:50,795
are still inside.

805
00:39:51,156 --> 00:39:52,116
Calm down.

806
00:39:52,195 --> 00:39:53,156
Mother?

807
00:39:53,195 --> 00:39:55,795
Grandma, please calm down.

808
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:21,916
Mother, don't you worry.

809
00:40:22,076 --> 00:40:23,715
I will do my best

810
00:40:23,835 --> 00:40:25,395
to restore Yixin Abode.

811
00:40:26,076 --> 00:40:28,476
The house can be rebuilt.

812
00:40:29,795 --> 00:40:31,116
But the sentiments

813
00:40:31,235 --> 00:40:33,275
and thoughts for your father

814
00:40:35,715 --> 00:40:37,956
were lost for good.

815
00:40:38,156 --> 00:40:40,275
I have failed your father.

816
00:40:43,516 --> 00:40:45,275
Old Madam, Second Master,

817
00:40:45,755 --> 00:40:46,556
we found

818
00:40:46,675 --> 00:40:47,956
a dead body inside.

819
00:40:48,076 --> 00:40:48,636
Who is it?

820
00:40:49,195 --> 00:40:50,556
Not one of us.

821
00:40:50,795 --> 00:40:51,636
Bring it here.

822
00:41:03,195 --> 00:41:04,436
Inform the authority at once.

823
00:41:04,596 --> 00:41:05,275
Yes.

824
00:41:13,596 --> 00:41:15,436
Why was it Li Yinglong?

825
00:41:16,476 --> 00:41:18,715
He meant to threaten Marquis
with the testimony.

826
00:41:19,636 --> 00:41:21,195
And where is it now?

827
00:41:22,516 --> 00:41:23,596
He got it.

828
00:41:23,755 --> 00:41:25,556
The whole beam fell on him.

829
00:41:25,795 --> 00:41:27,076
Had I gone there,

830
00:41:27,395 --> 00:41:28,195
there would've been

831
00:41:28,315 --> 00:41:29,996
two burnt corpses.

832
00:41:30,436 --> 00:41:32,395
I recognize his thumb ring.

833
00:41:32,596 --> 00:41:33,916
I could tell it was him

834
00:41:34,036 --> 00:41:35,275
based on his moves.

835
00:41:35,675 --> 00:41:36,395
Young Master.

836
00:41:37,355 --> 00:41:38,476
Perhaps losing the testimony

837
00:41:38,675 --> 00:41:40,235
is a silver lining.

838
00:41:43,956 --> 00:41:45,355
It landed right on the wound.

839
00:41:45,476 --> 00:41:46,715
The healing wound

840
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:47,795
is torn up again.

841
00:41:48,875 --> 00:41:49,636
Old Madam

842
00:41:49,755 --> 00:41:50,956
seems devastated.

843
00:41:51,076 --> 00:41:51,795
Was the testimony

844
00:41:51,875 --> 00:41:53,156
inside the study?

845
00:41:54,556 --> 00:41:55,556
No.

846
00:41:57,315 --> 00:41:58,156
If it were in there

847
00:41:58,275 --> 00:41:59,675
the whole time,

848
00:42:00,436 --> 00:42:01,875
Old Madam

849
00:42:01,956 --> 00:42:03,355
would've fainted.

850
00:42:04,352 --> 00:42:05,990
She made use of the fire
to elude a threat.

851
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:07,355
It was a ploy.

852
00:42:07,636 --> 00:42:08,476
Young Master.

853
00:42:08,956 --> 00:42:10,875
Aren't we supposed to bait her
into exposing

854
00:42:10,956 --> 00:42:12,076
the testimony's existence?

855
00:42:12,315 --> 00:42:13,956
Why did you act first?

856
00:42:14,036 --> 00:42:16,476
Old Master aided my master.

857
00:42:17,235 --> 00:42:19,315
I can't put the Luo family in danger.

858
00:42:19,596 --> 00:42:21,156
You did it for the Old Master,

859
00:42:21,195 --> 00:42:22,235
not Seventh Lady?

860
00:42:22,355 --> 00:42:23,195
Of course!

861
00:42:26,715 --> 00:42:28,476
But you went out of your way

862
00:42:28,596 --> 00:42:29,755
to forge a statement,

863
00:42:29,835 --> 00:42:30,996
move Li Yinglong's body

864
00:42:31,076 --> 00:42:31,835
into the fire,

865
00:42:32,036 --> 00:42:32,556
and get hit

866
00:42:32,636 --> 00:42:33,795
by a beam.

867
00:42:33,916 --> 00:42:34,875
Was it all necessary?

868
00:42:34,996 --> 00:42:35,315
Hey,

869
00:42:35,395 --> 00:42:36,755
just treat the wound.

870
00:42:36,795 --> 00:42:38,596
Stop asking so many questions.

871
00:42:38,675 --> 00:42:39,156
Lu Jiaxue

872
00:42:39,235 --> 00:42:40,395
isn't so easily deceived.

873
00:42:40,516 --> 00:42:41,395
The thief

874
00:42:41,436 --> 00:42:43,151
and the testimony must be burned!

875
00:42:43,152 --> 00:42:44,110
Only then will he spare

876
00:42:44,195 --> 00:42:45,275
the Luo family.

877
00:42:50,076 --> 00:42:50,755
