00:01:40,455 --> 00:01:41,774
The man I like

5
00:01:42,294 --> 00:01:44,335
should be dashing,

6
00:01:44,455 --> 00:01:45,494
have excellent character

7
00:01:45,854 --> 00:01:48,294
and talent, not just book-smart,

8
00:01:48,574 --> 00:01:50,774
be aware of the world
but not overly sophisticated,

9
00:01:51,455 --> 00:01:54,175
be skilled in martial arts,
be resilient,

10
00:01:54,774 --> 00:01:57,055
and must protect and cherish me.

11
00:01:57,055 --> 00:01:58,095
When I'm with him,

12
00:01:58,095 --> 00:01:59,895
he'll understand what I truly want

13
00:01:59,895 --> 00:02:01,895
and make me feel secure.

14
00:02:04,455 --> 00:02:06,255
That's quite a high standard.

15
00:02:07,095 --> 00:02:07,975
This man

16
00:02:08,974 --> 00:02:10,295
is truly one of a kind.

17
00:02:12,895 --> 00:02:16,654
Aside from me, are there really any others
like him around us?

Duke Ying.

24
00:03:05,575 --> 00:03:08,335
Third Yong Master Luo,
it's been a long while.

25
00:03:08,774 --> 00:03:10,175
I haven't come here for some time.

26
00:03:10,374 --> 00:03:11,135
I was thinking

27
00:03:11,135 --> 00:03:12,934
of making up the lessons for her.

28
00:03:13,135 --> 00:03:14,934
Sure. Go ahead.

29
00:03:17,694 --> 00:03:18,814
Go and study.

30
00:03:20,814 --> 00:03:21,494
Go on.

31
00:03:52,855 --> 00:03:53,654
Master,

32
00:03:53,654 --> 00:03:55,615
what book will we be reading today?

33
00:03:56,784 --> 00:03:59,890
"Strolling by the eastern gate, beauties
are as many as clouds in the sky.

34
00:04:00,254 --> 00:04:02,735
Even so, none of them
is the one I long for.

35
00:04:02,974 --> 00:04:05,849
Only the one in plain clothes
and a green headscarf captures my heart.

36
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:08,480
When I saunter outside the city,
beauties are as plenty as cogon grass.

37
00:04:08,496 --> 00:04:11,130
Even so, none of them
is the one I hold dear.

38
00:04:11,455 --> 00:04:14,254
Only the one in plain clothes
with a red handkerchief stirs my heart."

39
00:04:14,974 --> 00:04:17,254
What book is this?

40
00:04:17,295 --> 00:04:18,134
I don't understand.

41
00:04:21,615 --> 00:04:22,254
Yining,

42
00:04:22,894 --> 00:04:24,494
once I tie

43
00:04:24,775 --> 00:04:26,055
all the loose ends,

44
00:04:26,494 --> 00:04:27,775
I'll come and propose.

45
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:29,254
After that,

46
00:04:29,295 --> 00:04:31,095
I'll teach you the meaning of it.

47
00:04:31,134 --> 00:04:33,454
You're going to propose
to the Sun Family?

48
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:36,975
Who told you that?

49
00:04:37,975 --> 00:04:39,454
Don't ask.

50
00:04:46,134 --> 00:04:47,295
Why are you smiling?

51
00:04:48,295 --> 00:04:49,295
You are angry

52
00:04:51,055 --> 00:04:52,215
because you're jealous.

53
00:04:56,368 --> 00:04:57,970
I've already rejected the Sun Family.

54
00:05:01,295 --> 00:05:03,615
This has nothing to do with me.

55
00:05:04,454 --> 00:05:05,975
Of course it does.

56
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:08,928
Before I propose marriage to you,

57
00:05:09,295 --> 00:05:10,894
I can't let anyone steal you away.

58
00:05:13,215 --> 00:05:14,014
Well,

59
00:05:14,735 --> 00:05:16,055
I can't decide this.

60
00:05:17,975 --> 00:05:19,894
I don't think there's anyone

61
00:05:20,655 --> 00:05:22,494
who can decide your marriage.

62
00:05:25,334 --> 00:05:26,655
You should treat me better.

Who tells you to write something on it?

68
00:05:53,855 --> 00:05:55,975
All right. I'm sorry.

69
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:57,615
True.

70
00:05:57,975 --> 00:05:58,775
As you said,

71
00:05:59,134 --> 00:06:00,855
paintings and calligraphy

72
00:06:00,855 --> 00:06:02,295
don't necessarily exist together.

73
00:06:02,295 --> 00:06:03,295
You're now

74
00:06:03,295 --> 00:06:04,975
the imperial scholar
with three top scores.

75
00:06:05,088 --> 00:06:07,130
When you're promoted to the highest rank
in the future,

76
00:06:07,192 --> 00:06:08,192
perhaps I'll have

77
00:06:08,248 --> 00:06:10,087
to bid a high price for this painting.

78
00:06:11,648 --> 00:06:13,450
So, do you want me to
write an inscription

79
00:06:13,454 --> 00:06:14,374
or not?

80
00:06:15,454 --> 00:06:16,334
Go ahead, then.

81
00:06:29,454 --> 00:06:31,934
May the world

82
00:06:32,454 --> 00:06:34,894
always

83
00:06:36,175 --> 00:06:37,934
be filled with joy.

84
00:06:38,775 --> 00:06:41,134
I hope you will forever

85
00:06:41,454 --> 00:06:42,254
be happy

86
00:06:42,775 --> 00:06:43,655
and with me.

87
00:06:58,134 --> 00:06:58,855
Stand right there.

88
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,160
Sir.

89
00:07:02,095 --> 00:07:03,655
Are they searching for someone again?

90
00:07:07,655 --> 00:07:08,454
Sir.

91
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,281
(Wanted, Yang Ling)

92
00:07:29,975 --> 00:07:30,855
Sir,

93
00:07:31,254 --> 00:07:32,894
these are fresh seafood.

94
00:07:32,975 --> 00:07:34,295
It can't hold on longer.

95
00:07:34,574 --> 00:07:36,055
Kindly do us a favor.

96
00:07:39,655 --> 00:07:40,454
Let them go.

97
00:07:46,975 --> 00:07:47,814
Hold up.

98
00:07:55,894 --> 00:07:57,095
What are those on the cart?

99
00:07:58,295 --> 00:07:59,454
Sir,

100
00:07:59,894 --> 00:08:01,374
these are fresh seafood.

101
00:08:01,735 --> 00:08:02,615
Open them.

102
00:08:02,615 --> 00:08:04,055
No, please, sir.

103
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,694
All the boxes are sealed properly.

104
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:06,735
They'll spoil

105
00:08:06,735 --> 00:08:08,055
if you open them.

106
00:08:13,334 --> 00:08:15,055
Sir, please understand.

107
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:16,494
I'm just a vendor

108
00:08:16,494 --> 00:08:17,694
trying to make a living.

109
00:08:20,912 --> 00:08:22,290
Marquis Lu, the goods are fine.

110
00:08:32,454 --> 00:08:33,454
What's wrong, sir?

111
00:09:16,895 --> 00:09:19,334
Yang Ling, I knew it was you.

112
00:09:20,934 --> 00:09:21,734
Get him.

113
00:09:46,032 --> 00:09:47,696
I'm Yang Ling, Vice Minister of Revenue.

114
00:09:47,744 --> 00:09:49,712
I've been framed while investigating
a smuggling case.

115
00:09:49,775 --> 00:09:51,094
Someone wants to silence me!

116
00:10:17,175 --> 00:10:17,974
Retreat.

117
00:10:19,334 --> 00:10:20,135
Give chase.

118
00:10:27,175 --> 00:10:28,175
Yang Ling, the criminal,

119
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:29,334
now surrender peacefully.

120
00:10:29,895 --> 00:10:31,295
I've been wrongfully accused.

121
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:32,175
Take him down.

122
00:10:32,655 --> 00:10:33,415
Stop.

123
00:10:36,214 --> 00:10:37,015
Marquis Lu.

124
00:10:39,495 --> 00:10:41,614
News travels fast, Minister Luo.

125
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:43,375
You show up

126
00:10:43,488 --> 00:10:45,130
right after Yang Ling
enters the city gate.

127
00:10:45,334 --> 00:10:46,375
I happened to pass by

128
00:10:46,495 --> 00:10:48,094
and heard a noise over here,

129
00:10:48,094 --> 00:10:50,175
so I came to check it out.

130
00:10:51,454 --> 00:10:52,974
You happened to pass by?

131
00:10:53,008 --> 00:10:54,770
The Imperial Guards
are arresting a criminal,

132
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:56,096
so you should step aside.

133
00:10:56,144 --> 00:10:57,888
Imperial Court of Judicial
manages the prison

134
00:10:57,888 --> 00:10:59,450
and investigates officials
and all matters.

135
00:10:59,454 --> 00:11:00,135
This case

136
00:11:00,135 --> 00:11:01,495
should be handled by us,

137
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:03,175
so you should step aside.

138
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,816
You're entitled to investigate the case

139
00:11:06,175 --> 00:11:08,094
but don't have the power
to make arrests.

140
00:11:08,295 --> 00:11:10,255
Once I capture the criminal

141
00:11:10,255 --> 00:11:11,375
and report it to His Majesty,

142
00:11:11,495 --> 00:11:12,775
if Imperial Court of Judicial

143
00:11:12,775 --> 00:11:14,775
is ordered to take over this case,

144
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:16,974
I'll hand over the criminal to you.

145
00:11:18,454 --> 00:11:19,295
Minister Luo,

146
00:11:19,334 --> 00:11:20,614
I've been falsely accused.

147
00:11:20,694 --> 00:11:22,094
Please seek justice for me.

148
00:11:22,614 --> 00:11:23,734
According to national laws,

149
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:24,912
if a criminal claims innocence,

150
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,770
entitled officials
will take over the case

151
00:11:26,775 --> 00:11:28,135
and report it to His Majesty.

152
00:11:29,454 --> 00:11:31,175
Since the Imperial Guards have

153
00:11:31,175 --> 00:11:32,454
already captured the criminal,

154
00:11:32,454 --> 00:11:34,775
you may leave the rest to me.

155
00:11:39,814 --> 00:11:41,454
Step aside, Minister Luo.

156
00:12:03,104 --> 00:12:04,624
- Chancellor Wang.
- Chancellor Wang.

157
00:12:10,495 --> 00:12:11,814
I didn't expect Yang Ling

158
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,255
to be captured so quickly.

159
00:12:13,454 --> 00:12:14,895
Well done, Marquis Lu.

160
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:16,814
I'm just doing my duty.

161
00:12:17,392 --> 00:12:18,610
It's a coincidence, though.

162
00:12:18,854 --> 00:12:20,934
His Majesty just issued a decree.

163
00:12:21,135 --> 00:12:22,934
If Yang Ling is arrested,

164
00:12:23,135 --> 00:12:25,135
the case will be handled
by both the Imperial Guards

165
00:12:25,135 --> 00:12:27,814
and the Imperial Court of Judicial.

166
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,296
- Yes, Your Excellency.
- Yes, Your Excellency.

167
00:12:36,135 --> 00:12:39,055
Escort Yang Ling
to Imperial Court of Judicial.

168
00:12:42,295 --> 00:12:43,974
Chancellor Wang, Marquis Lu,

169
00:12:45,135 --> 00:12:47,255
I shall take my leave.

170
00:13:01,135 --> 00:13:01,974
Chancellor Wang,

171
00:13:02,454 --> 00:13:04,295
Imperial Court of Judicial
suddenly steps in,

172
00:13:04,295 --> 00:13:05,734
- I'm worried...
- Why worry?

173
00:13:06,295 --> 00:13:08,295
There's solid evidence
against Yang Ling.

174
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:10,135
The results won't change

175
00:13:10,814 --> 00:13:12,495
no matter
who conducts the interrogation.

176
00:13:12,574 --> 00:13:13,895
You're right.

177
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:17,974
Besides, Yang Ling is just
a mere vice minister.

178
00:13:18,974 --> 00:13:20,974
He must be acting
on the orders of Sun Jie.

179
00:13:21,255 --> 00:13:22,495
Sun Jie?

180
00:13:34,094 --> 00:13:34,895
Your Lordship.

181
00:13:35,454 --> 00:13:36,255
Your Lordship,

182
00:13:36,295 --> 00:13:37,814
those vendors all got away.

183
00:13:37,895 --> 00:13:39,454
Judging by their skills,

184
00:13:39,454 --> 00:13:40,974
they must be Chen Jiuheng's accomplices.

185
00:13:41,295 --> 00:13:42,334
Monitor everyone inside

186
00:13:42,334 --> 00:13:43,574
and outside the capital closely,

187
00:13:45,175 --> 00:13:47,135
especially Luo Shenyuan.

188
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:47,655
Yes.

189
00:14:16,454 --> 00:14:17,814
It's only a few lashes,

190
00:14:18,295 --> 00:14:19,334
and he's already fainted.

191
00:14:19,895 --> 00:14:20,694
Come.

192
00:14:21,574 --> 00:14:22,334
Wake him up.

193
00:14:34,934 --> 00:14:36,094
I'll take a rest.

194
00:14:36,694 --> 00:14:37,974
Please continue, Minister Luo.

195
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,614
(Caifu Abode)

196
00:15:10,655 --> 00:15:12,854
Shenyuan always knows the boundaries.

197
00:15:12,854 --> 00:15:14,135
Since he's been appointed

198
00:15:14,135 --> 00:15:15,734
to handle Yang Ling's case,

199
00:15:16,574 --> 00:15:18,334
why are there negative opinions
about him?

200
00:15:19,255 --> 00:15:20,295
Yang Ling

201
00:15:20,295 --> 00:15:22,295
was heavily tortured
during his interrogation.

202
00:15:22,295 --> 00:15:23,495
Many people say

203
00:15:24,655 --> 00:15:26,295
that he's trying to distance himself.

204
00:15:26,454 --> 00:15:27,974
Why would he do that?

205
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:30,255
Tea is the main source

206
00:15:30,454 --> 00:15:32,295
of military provisions and taxes.

207
00:15:32,454 --> 00:15:33,814
One could lose their head

208
00:15:34,135 --> 00:15:35,895
for smuggling tea.

209
00:15:36,055 --> 00:15:38,135
Plus, Yang Ling is his senior.

210
00:15:38,135 --> 00:15:39,175
How can he avoid suspicion

211
00:15:39,175 --> 00:15:40,895
if he's not strict enough?

212
00:15:42,814 --> 00:15:43,614
Of course,

213
00:15:44,334 --> 00:15:46,135
I approve of his action.

214
00:15:46,694 --> 00:15:49,375
This is the right thing to do
in situations like this.

215
00:15:52,175 --> 00:15:53,854
Third Brother isn't that kind of person.

216
00:15:54,775 --> 00:15:55,974
He always knows

217
00:15:56,135 --> 00:15:57,574
what he's doing.

218
00:15:57,734 --> 00:15:59,135
Yes, I agree.

219
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,159
Shenyuan

220
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,280
isn't an ungrateful person.

221
00:16:02,175 --> 00:16:03,574
You're short-sighted.

222
00:16:03,694 --> 00:16:05,934
If Shenyuan got involved,

223
00:16:06,255 --> 00:16:08,655
the entire Luo Family
would also be domed.

224
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,840
Shenyuan has his own considerations.

225
00:16:12,454 --> 00:16:14,289
You can only see the surface

226
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:15,472
but not the meaning behind it.

227
00:16:16,814 --> 00:16:17,614
Fine.

228
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,200
Everything you say is right.

229
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,399
I'd like to see

230
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:22,464
what the meaning behind his action is,
all right?

231
00:16:24,094 --> 00:16:24,895
Mother,

232
00:16:25,929 --> 00:16:27,848
when will Third Brother return home?

233
00:16:28,295 --> 00:16:30,295
He hasn't come back
in the past few days.

234
00:16:30,295 --> 00:16:32,175
He's been dealing with the case.

235
00:16:32,175 --> 00:16:33,574
Unless Yang Ling's case concludes,

236
00:16:33,614 --> 00:16:34,974
I don't think he'll come back.

237
00:16:37,175 --> 00:16:37,974
Madam.

238
00:16:37,974 --> 00:16:39,334
Why the panic?

239
00:16:39,574 --> 00:16:40,694
Ms. Wu is here.

240
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,919
Mother, if you have something urgent
to attend to,

241
00:16:47,055 --> 00:16:48,334
I'll leave first.

242
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:51,360
Spend a few days here
when you have time.

243
00:16:54,774 --> 00:16:55,894
Greetings, Second Master Luo.

244
00:16:56,263 --> 00:16:57,582
Greetings, Madam Lin.

245
00:16:57,614 --> 00:16:59,334
Ms. Wu, please take a seat.

246
00:16:59,775 --> 00:17:00,895
Thank you, Madam Lin.

247
00:17:03,334 --> 00:17:04,654
Why did you come

248
00:17:04,654 --> 00:17:06,289
on short notice?

249
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:08,390
I could've sent someone
to pick you up at the city gate.

250
00:17:08,495 --> 00:17:09,495
Please don't say that.

251
00:17:09,495 --> 00:17:11,134
You flatter me.

252
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,920
I just came here to relay a message.

253
00:17:13,614 --> 00:17:15,695
It's trouble for you
to come all the way here.

254
00:17:15,695 --> 00:17:17,134
You could've just written a letter.

255
00:17:17,174 --> 00:17:19,295
No, Old Madam Lin said

256
00:17:19,295 --> 00:17:20,654
this is a serious matter,

257
00:17:20,775 --> 00:17:21,814
so I must

258
00:17:21,814 --> 00:17:23,295
personally deliver the message.

259
00:17:26,134 --> 00:17:27,775
Ms. Wu, please tell us.

260
00:17:28,134 --> 00:17:30,055
No, Old Madam Lin said

261
00:17:30,055 --> 00:17:31,455
I must say it in front of you

262
00:17:31,455 --> 00:17:33,455
and Young Master Mao.

263
00:17:35,814 --> 00:17:37,735
Rui Xiang, bring Mao here.

264
00:17:37,775 --> 00:17:38,574
Yes.

265
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:53,375
Leave it there.

266
00:17:59,654 --> 00:18:00,414
Yixiu.

267
00:18:01,894 --> 00:18:03,134
Why am I sleeping?

268
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,641
When did you arrive?

269
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,641
I just arrived.

270
00:18:05,735 --> 00:18:07,174
Are you really tired lately?

271
00:18:07,174 --> 00:18:07,975
That's a good sign.

272
00:18:08,134 --> 00:18:09,455
It means more wealth is pouring in.

273
00:18:09,975 --> 00:18:11,295
I brought you some soup

274
00:18:11,295 --> 00:18:13,255
and some dried fish for Fugui.

275
00:18:13,654 --> 00:18:14,775
Fugui is not a cat.

276
00:18:14,975 --> 00:18:16,174
It can't eat dried fish.

277
00:18:16,975 --> 00:18:19,614
Oh, right.
I shouldn't have brought that.

278
00:18:19,975 --> 00:18:20,769
But I can't let your

279
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:21,776
good intentions be wasted.

280
00:18:21,814 --> 00:18:22,614
Fugui,

281
00:18:22,854 --> 00:18:24,055
let's not be picky over food.

282
00:18:25,495 --> 00:18:26,695
Come. Drink some soup.

283
00:18:28,295 --> 00:18:29,334
Did you prepare this?

284
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:31,704
The kitchen did.

285
00:18:33,495 --> 00:18:34,455
Greetings, Sixth Lady.

286
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,080
Young Master Mao,
someone from Lin'an came.

287
00:18:36,134 --> 00:18:37,735
Madam Lin wants you to go
to the front hall.

288
00:18:37,975 --> 00:18:38,814
Who came?

289
00:18:38,935 --> 00:18:39,775
It's Ms. Wu.

290
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:42,455
Why did she come here?

291
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:44,574
Who's Ms. Wu?

292
00:18:44,608 --> 00:18:45,650
She's my mother's handmaiden

293
00:18:45,654 --> 00:18:47,094
who's served her since childhood

294
00:18:47,183 --> 00:18:48,742
and my sister's governess.

295
00:18:49,574 --> 00:18:51,455
She's the nearest maid beside my mother

296
00:18:51,633 --> 00:18:52,712
and has never left.

297
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,320
Perhaps it's about our marriage.

298
00:18:55,495 --> 00:18:56,614
I'll be right back.

299
00:18:58,975 --> 00:18:59,654
Where's she?

300
00:18:59,654 --> 00:19:00,935
Let's go.

301
00:19:04,735 --> 00:19:05,735
Ms. Wu, you're here.

302
00:19:06,064 --> 00:19:07,290
Young Master Mao, you're here.

303
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,599
Why did Mother

304
00:19:09,614 --> 00:19:11,094
send you here?

305
00:19:11,134 --> 00:19:12,654
Who will take care of her

306
00:19:12,654 --> 00:19:13,775
when you're away?

307
00:19:13,975 --> 00:19:15,295
Since you're here,

308
00:19:15,295 --> 00:19:18,094
I'll start delivering
the message boldly.

309
00:19:36,814 --> 00:19:38,255
I entrusted your brother

310
00:19:38,255 --> 00:19:39,495
to you,

311
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,401
and yet he's become rebellious.

312
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:44,055
You must reflect on yourself.

313
00:19:45,654 --> 00:19:48,134
The marriage between Mao
and the Sixth Lady

314
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,240
is never possible.

315
00:19:49,894 --> 00:19:50,854
I've been rejecting it

316
00:19:50,854 --> 00:19:52,455
for more than one time,

317
00:19:53,455 --> 00:19:54,574
and you kept writing

318
00:19:54,574 --> 00:19:55,735
back to Lin'an.

319
00:19:55,935 --> 00:19:58,215
Do you want to drive me crazy?

320
00:19:59,055 --> 00:20:01,374
If Mao still won't give up,

321
00:20:01,557 --> 00:20:02,894
from now on,

322
00:20:02,975 --> 00:20:03,814
neither of you

323
00:20:03,814 --> 00:20:05,574
will return to Lin'an.

324
00:20:06,295 --> 00:20:07,614
The family register

325
00:20:07,735 --> 00:20:09,094
won't have your names either.

326
00:20:09,654 --> 00:20:11,255
What's wrong with Yixiu?

327
00:20:11,255 --> 00:20:13,215
How could Mother judge her
even before meeting her?

328
00:20:14,295 --> 00:20:15,255
Young Master Mao,

329
00:20:15,334 --> 00:20:17,255
don't be mad at me.

330
00:20:17,655 --> 00:20:19,294
I'm just a messenger.

331
00:20:19,334 --> 00:20:21,134
Ms. Wu, please relay this message back.

332
00:20:21,295 --> 00:20:22,614
I like Yixiu.

333
00:20:24,695 --> 00:20:26,455
I, Lin Mao, swear to heaven.

334
00:20:26,614 --> 00:20:28,174
I will marry no one but Yixiu.

335
00:20:28,775 --> 00:20:29,854
If I ever go against this vow,

336
00:20:29,854 --> 00:20:30,969
lighting will strike me down.

337
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:33,008
I will live alone until I die
and have no children...

338
00:20:34,614 --> 00:20:35,975
Old Madam Lin also said

339
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,599
that if you disobey her

340
00:20:37,654 --> 00:20:39,854
and insist on marrying
a murderer's daughter,

341
00:20:39,854 --> 00:20:42,334
she might as well take her own life.

342
00:20:42,455 --> 00:20:44,134
If you dare to appear at her funeral,

343
00:20:44,295 --> 00:20:45,735
you will be kicked out.

344
00:20:50,055 --> 00:20:50,854
Ms. Wu.

345
00:20:52,854 --> 00:20:53,654
Second Master Luo.

346
00:20:54,112 --> 00:20:55,450
Yixiu is the legitimate daughter

347
00:20:55,455 --> 00:20:56,695
of the Luo Family.

348
00:20:57,295 --> 00:20:58,814
Yes, her mother has done
something wrong,

349
00:20:58,935 --> 00:21:00,654
but she's already been punished.

350
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:02,447
The entire Luo Family

351
00:21:02,975 --> 00:21:04,614
is backing Yixiu up.

352
00:21:05,374 --> 00:21:07,174
Even if the Lin Family
doesn't accept her,

353
00:21:07,894 --> 00:21:09,609
the Luo Family couldn't
care less about that.

354
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:11,248
- Second Master...
- That being said,

355
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:15,240
true love is precious.
Not many couples can get together.

356
00:21:15,495 --> 00:21:17,374
If they truly love each other,

357
00:21:17,775 --> 00:21:19,455
shouldn't we elders

358
00:21:19,574 --> 00:21:21,094
set aside our prejudices

359
00:21:21,455 --> 00:21:22,574
and support them?

360
00:21:23,174 --> 00:21:24,094
I will relay your words

361
00:21:24,094 --> 00:21:25,935
to Old Madam Lin.

362
00:21:26,174 --> 00:21:28,255
However, Old Master Lin
and Old Madam Lin

363
00:21:28,255 --> 00:21:29,374
are very determined.

364
00:21:29,632 --> 00:21:31,680
Even though the Lin Family
isn't a prestigious family,

365
00:21:31,735 --> 00:21:34,015
we're affluent

366
00:21:34,015 --> 00:21:35,094
in Jiangnan.

367
00:21:35,264 --> 00:21:38,016
The business credibility depends on
a good reputation and connections.

368
00:21:38,064 --> 00:21:40,250
We can't afford to bear rumors.

369
00:21:40,255 --> 00:21:41,329
What rumors?

370
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:42,720
Yixiu is innocent.

371
00:21:42,736 --> 00:21:44,032
She even chose justice over family.

372
00:21:44,096 --> 00:21:44,576
Enough.

373
00:21:48,654 --> 00:21:49,614
We understand

374
00:21:50,295 --> 00:21:51,374
what Mother is trying to say.

375
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:53,695
I've already conveyed the message.

376
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:54,975
I should get going now.

377
00:21:54,975 --> 00:21:56,134
You just arrived.

378
00:21:56,894 --> 00:21:57,654
Why don't you

379
00:21:57,654 --> 00:21:58,975
stay here for a few more days?

380
00:21:59,054 --> 00:22:00,255
Old Madam Lin

381
00:22:00,654 --> 00:22:01,975
wants me to leave right after this.

382
00:22:02,247 --> 00:22:04,207
She doesn't have any other messages.

383
00:22:13,295 --> 00:22:15,574
I didn't know the Lin Family

384
00:22:15,854 --> 00:22:17,574
had more rules than us.

385
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:18,800
The merchant family, you know.

386
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,519
Hairu, Second Master,

387
00:22:22,134 --> 00:22:24,174
I'm determined to marry Yixiu.

388
00:22:29,295 --> 00:22:30,255
It seems

389
00:22:31,174 --> 00:22:33,775
Father and Mother
won't change their minds easily.

390
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,160
Give me some time to think about it.

391
00:22:48,134 --> 00:22:48,975
Fugui?

392
00:22:50,015 --> 00:22:50,814
Where's Yixiu?

393
00:22:55,174 --> 00:22:55,894
Too bad.

394
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,820
(Danhua Abode)

395
00:23:15,475 --> 00:23:17,935
Don't be upset, Young Lady.

396
00:23:19,174 --> 00:23:20,935
But what Ms. Wu said

397
00:23:21,614 --> 00:23:23,094
was true.

398
00:23:24,975 --> 00:23:25,775
Yixiu.

399
00:23:33,334 --> 00:23:34,255
Why are you here?

400
00:23:34,255 --> 00:23:35,255
You have a guest.

401
00:23:35,255 --> 00:23:36,215
Ms. Wu has left.

402
00:23:37,455 --> 00:23:38,295
What's wrong with you?

403
00:23:38,814 --> 00:23:40,134
Your eyes are red.

404
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,640
I got some sand in my eyes.

405
00:23:42,695 --> 00:23:43,455
It's fine.

406
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:44,414
Let me blow it out.

407
00:23:46,695 --> 00:23:47,695
Someone's here.

408
00:23:50,814 --> 00:23:51,455
Did you hear

409
00:23:51,455 --> 00:23:52,775
what Ms. Wu said?

410
00:23:53,654 --> 00:23:54,775
Don't take it to heart.

411
00:23:55,775 --> 00:23:57,455
I know your parents

412
00:23:57,695 --> 00:23:59,255
disapprove of my mother's behavior.

413
00:24:00,255 --> 00:24:02,854
But even if she's a terrible person,

414
00:24:02,854 --> 00:24:04,495
she's still my mother.

415
00:24:04,854 --> 00:24:05,654
I know,

416
00:24:05,654 --> 00:24:07,455
so I resolve this matter well.

417
00:24:07,455 --> 00:24:08,414
Trust me.

418
00:24:13,055 --> 00:24:13,854
Why?

419
00:24:14,455 --> 00:24:16,374
You don't believe
I can convince my parents?

420
00:24:17,854 --> 00:24:19,134
I do trust you,

421
00:24:19,215 --> 00:24:20,894
but I don't want to put you on the spot.

422
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:22,255
If you fall out

423
00:24:22,255 --> 00:24:23,614
with your parents because of me,

424
00:24:23,654 --> 00:24:24,414
it would be

425
00:24:24,814 --> 00:24:26,134
a great sin for me.

426
00:24:28,414 --> 00:24:29,414
Just wait for me.

427
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:47,992
(Imperial Court of Judicial)

428
00:24:49,195 --> 00:24:50,882
(Imperial Court of Judicial)

429
00:24:52,956 --> 00:24:53,775
Young Lady,

430
00:24:54,094 --> 00:24:56,094
are you waiting here
for Third Young Master?

431
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,441
Young Lady Wei, what brings you here?

432
00:25:11,215 --> 00:25:12,495
Just passing by.

433
00:25:12,814 --> 00:25:14,134
Please make way, Your Lordship.

434
00:25:15,374 --> 00:25:16,174
Let's go.

435
00:25:25,574 --> 00:25:26,894
Marquis Lu, what do you mean?

436
00:25:27,255 --> 00:25:29,334
I suppose you specifically came here

437
00:25:29,894 --> 00:25:31,134
for something important, right?

438
00:25:33,094 --> 00:25:34,295
Perhaps I can

439
00:25:34,695 --> 00:25:35,695
bring you in.

440
00:25:38,455 --> 00:25:39,814
I'm just

441
00:25:40,134 --> 00:25:42,174
offering to help.

442
00:25:42,695 --> 00:25:43,455
Come this way.

443
00:25:51,015 --> 00:25:52,094
Just kill me.

444
00:25:52,814 --> 00:25:54,735
I won't grant your wish so easily.

445
00:25:55,975 --> 00:25:56,735
Come clean.

446
00:25:57,614 --> 00:25:59,414
Why did you kill all of them?

447
00:26:00,055 --> 00:26:01,295
I didn't kill anyone.

448
00:26:02,134 --> 00:26:03,334
They were already dead

449
00:26:03,814 --> 00:26:05,255
when I boarded the ship.

450
00:26:06,735 --> 00:26:07,854
At this rate,

451
00:26:08,654 --> 00:26:09,854
stop denying it.

452
00:26:11,975 --> 00:26:13,174
I really didn't kill them.

453
00:26:13,775 --> 00:26:15,455
This is a set-up.

454
00:26:16,295 --> 00:26:18,134
They lured me onto the ship

455
00:26:18,935 --> 00:26:20,814
and planted a few people
to feign injury

456
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,721
to accuse me of murder.

457
00:26:23,414 --> 00:26:25,614
I was investigating smuggling.

458
00:26:26,215 --> 00:26:27,814
I wanted the suspects alive.

459
00:26:28,894 --> 00:26:30,574
Why would I kill them?

460
00:26:30,975 --> 00:26:32,614
It wouldn't do me any good.

461
00:26:32,814 --> 00:26:34,094
Are you suggesting

462
00:26:35,255 --> 00:26:38,094
that the smugglers
killed their own people

463
00:26:38,614 --> 00:26:39,975
and sank the ship

464
00:26:40,094 --> 00:26:41,614
just to frame you?

465
00:26:42,775 --> 00:26:43,975
Who are you trying to convince?

466
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,241
This is the truth.

467
00:26:45,744 --> 00:26:47,648
Whether you believe it or not
is up to you.

468
00:27:43,975 --> 00:27:44,894
What brings you here?

469
00:27:49,455 --> 00:27:51,455
Young Lady Wei seems
to have come here to see you

470
00:27:51,455 --> 00:27:52,574
for something important,

471
00:27:52,894 --> 00:27:54,455
so I brought her in.

472
00:27:55,134 --> 00:27:55,935
This is absurd!

473
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,650
This is the official
investigation premises.

474
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:00,448
Unauthorized people
aren't allowed to enter.

475
00:28:01,854 --> 00:28:02,654
Minister Luo,

476
00:28:04,295 --> 00:28:05,334
are you

477
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:07,174
blaming me?

478
00:28:11,094 --> 00:28:11,814
I'm just

479
00:28:11,814 --> 00:28:13,574
being realistic.

480
00:28:17,215 --> 00:28:18,174
Leave right now.

481
00:28:31,174 --> 00:28:33,894
Who was the lady just now?

482
00:28:36,614 --> 00:28:37,495
Chancellor Wang,

483
00:28:38,064 --> 00:28:40,112
she used to be my sister
at the Luo's Residence,

484
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:42,064
and now she's the legitimate daughter
of Duke Ying.

485
00:28:43,735 --> 00:28:45,614
I've heard a bit

486
00:28:45,894 --> 00:28:47,695
about Duke Ying's lost daughter.

487
00:28:48,255 --> 00:28:49,374
It seems

488
00:28:49,455 --> 00:28:50,614
you're quite close

489
00:28:50,614 --> 00:28:52,174
to this young lady.

490
00:28:52,192 --> 00:28:54,304
She even came to the Imperial Court
of Judicial for you.

491
00:28:55,055 --> 00:28:56,174
That's not true.

492
00:28:57,174 --> 00:28:58,775
We rarely met each other since she moved

493
00:28:58,775 --> 00:28:59,894
into Duke Ying's Residence.

494
00:29:00,248 --> 00:29:01,929
I don't know why she came here.

495
00:29:02,134 --> 00:29:03,215
It's fine.

496
00:29:03,215 --> 00:29:04,455
You can ask her now.

497
00:29:04,912 --> 00:29:07,050
There's no need. The interrogation
is more important.

498
00:29:08,334 --> 00:29:08,894
All right.

499
00:29:22,495 --> 00:29:23,295
Young Lady Wei,

500
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:25,210
I suppose you haven't seen

501
00:29:25,215 --> 00:29:26,814
this side of your Third Brother,
have you?

502
00:29:27,495 --> 00:29:28,695
Whether I've seen it or not

503
00:29:28,775 --> 00:29:30,455
is our own business.

504
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:32,215
It doesn't concern you, does it?

505
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,320
Yang Ling is his senior,

506
00:29:35,295 --> 00:29:37,295
and yet he still uses torture on him.

507
00:29:38,854 --> 00:29:40,614
Why are you telling me this?

508
00:29:41,334 --> 00:29:42,455
As a woman,

509
00:29:42,464 --> 00:29:43,920
I don't know much about court affairs.

510
00:29:46,775 --> 00:29:47,574
Why?

511
00:29:48,015 --> 00:29:49,455
Are you not willing to believe

512
00:29:49,574 --> 00:29:51,255
this is his true nature?

513
00:29:51,255 --> 00:29:53,455
Marquis Lu, do you have no work to do?

514
00:29:54,055 --> 00:29:55,495
Why do you always block my way?

515
00:29:55,654 --> 00:29:58,015
A man who can lie low
and endure humiliation

516
00:29:58,015 --> 00:29:59,055
until today

517
00:29:59,295 --> 00:30:00,255
shows that he's

518
00:30:00,255 --> 00:30:01,735
an unscrupulous person

519
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:04,495
and will pay any price

520
00:30:04,495 --> 00:30:05,735
to achieve his goal.

521
00:30:05,814 --> 00:30:07,174
Haven't you seen through him yet?

522
00:30:07,174 --> 00:30:08,495
I know very well

523
00:30:08,654 --> 00:30:10,134
what kind of person he is.

524
00:30:10,295 --> 00:30:12,614
Today, he sacrificed his senior.

525
00:30:13,495 --> 00:30:15,814
In the future,
he can also sacrifice his family.

526
00:30:16,174 --> 00:30:17,854
Luo's Residence once mistreated him.

527
00:30:21,495 --> 00:30:23,134
Do you think

528
00:30:23,495 --> 00:30:25,854
he'd care about the family ties
you value?

529
00:30:27,495 --> 00:30:28,334
Not to mention,

530
00:30:29,134 --> 00:30:30,455
he's a lowly spawn...

531
00:30:34,614 --> 00:30:36,055
Do not insult him.

532
00:30:36,894 --> 00:30:37,695
Young Lady Wei,

533
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,559
I'm truly afraid you'll get hurt.

534
00:30:41,374 --> 00:30:42,174
Lu Jiaxue,

535
00:30:42,975 --> 00:30:45,055
you're the last person who can say that.

536
00:30:51,552 --> 00:30:52,800
Are you all right, Young Lady?

537
00:30:53,215 --> 00:30:53,775
Let's go.

538
00:31:03,134 --> 00:31:04,455
Where are you going?

539
00:31:05,495 --> 00:31:06,495
I'm going back to Lin'an.

540
00:31:07,295 --> 00:31:08,455
Because of Yixiu?

541
00:31:09,015 --> 00:31:09,574
Yes.

542
00:31:10,055 --> 00:31:10,735
Mao...

543
00:31:10,735 --> 00:31:11,935
Don't need to persuade me.

544
00:31:12,031 --> 00:31:13,110
I've already made up my mind.

545
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,050
I'm going to explain everything
to Father and Mother.

546
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,881
I'm not here to persuade you.

547
00:31:17,094 --> 00:31:18,255
I'm saying

548
00:31:18,255 --> 00:31:19,654
that I'll go back with you.

549
00:31:19,654 --> 00:31:20,654
Perhaps I can help you.

550
00:31:23,334 --> 00:31:23,854
Hairu...

551
00:31:25,455 --> 00:31:27,735
Hairu, you've helped me a lot.

552
00:31:28,015 --> 00:31:29,894
I can't always rely on you.

553
00:31:31,295 --> 00:31:32,409
I've decided.

554
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:33,632
I want to stand on my own feet

555
00:31:33,695 --> 00:31:35,295
and give Yixiu a peaceful life.

556
00:31:37,455 --> 00:31:38,414
You've grown up.

557
00:31:38,735 --> 00:31:40,574
I'll arrange a carriage
for you tomorrow.

558
00:31:40,854 --> 00:31:42,455
Don't just go back unprepared.

559
00:31:42,455 --> 00:31:43,495
The journey can be dangerous.

560
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,881
Hairu, you're always so kind to me.

561
00:31:46,935 --> 00:31:48,374
Yixiu is a decent lady.

562
00:31:48,455 --> 00:31:50,614
I'll be at ease if you can marry her.

563
00:31:50,814 --> 00:31:52,409
I'll return home and try my best.

564
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:53,792
I want to let Father and Mother know

565
00:31:53,808 --> 00:31:55,130
how wonderful Yixiu is.

566
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:57,614
Well, if you really wish

567
00:31:57,614 --> 00:31:59,215
to marry Yixiu,

568
00:31:59,374 --> 00:32:00,814
think twice before you talk or act

569
00:32:00,814 --> 00:32:02,015
after you go back.

570
00:32:02,015 --> 00:32:03,255
Don't be so stubborn

571
00:32:03,695 --> 00:32:04,975
and talk back to them.

572
00:32:05,374 --> 00:32:06,735
You know very well

573
00:32:06,814 --> 00:32:08,134
how Father and Mother are.

574
00:32:08,464 --> 00:32:09,970
They'll accept it if you speak nicely.

575
00:32:11,334 --> 00:32:13,015
Come and help me tie this up.

576
00:32:21,134 --> 00:32:23,089
Hairu, I don't need all these.

577
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:24,544
You don't have to prepare them for me.

578
00:32:24,927 --> 00:32:26,199
These gifts are for Father, Mother,

579
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,559
and the family.

580
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,935
You can't just go back home
empty-handed.

581
00:32:30,455 --> 00:32:31,295
By the way,

582
00:32:31,455 --> 00:32:33,374
go and bid farewell
to Old Madam Luo later.

583
00:32:33,414 --> 00:32:34,814
Don't forget your manners.

584
00:32:35,215 --> 00:32:36,334
I almost forgot.

585
00:32:37,134 --> 00:32:38,854
Hairu, I'll be on my way.

586
00:32:39,775 --> 00:32:40,814
Safe trip.

587
00:32:41,414 --> 00:32:41,975
Go ahead.

588
00:32:48,894 --> 00:32:49,614
Young Lady!

589
00:32:50,654 --> 00:32:51,414
Young Lady!

590
00:32:51,894 --> 00:32:52,489
What's it?

591
00:32:52,490 --> 00:32:53,264
Young Master Lin

592
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,610
went to Muxi Hall early this morning

593
00:32:54,614 --> 00:32:55,854
to bid farewell to Old Madam.

594
00:32:55,855 --> 00:32:57,295
He's returned to Lin'an.

595
00:33:01,255 --> 00:33:01,854
Young Lady.

596
00:33:03,775 --> 00:33:04,414
Second Aunt.

597
00:33:05,455 --> 00:33:06,374
You're here, Yixiu.

598
00:33:06,534 --> 00:33:07,614
The kitchen

599
00:33:07,622 --> 00:33:08,903
prepared some pastries today.

600
00:33:08,935 --> 00:33:10,094
Come and have a taste.

601
00:33:12,134 --> 00:33:12,975
Second Aunt,

602
00:33:12,975 --> 00:33:14,975
we should go and get Lin Mao back.

603
00:33:15,415 --> 00:33:16,255
Why?

604
00:33:16,935 --> 00:33:17,574
I know

605
00:33:17,574 --> 00:33:19,295
he went back home because of me.

606
00:33:20,134 --> 00:33:21,134
Don't worry.

607
00:33:21,775 --> 00:33:22,854
He'll be back soon.

608
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:27,255
Honestly, I heard everything Ms. Wu said

609
00:33:27,814 --> 00:33:29,015
that day.

610
00:33:30,414 --> 00:33:31,255
Good girl.

611
00:33:31,374 --> 00:33:32,654
Don't take it personally.

612
00:33:33,414 --> 00:33:34,414
They're not speaking

613
00:33:34,654 --> 00:33:35,894
about you personally.

614
00:33:36,455 --> 00:33:37,255
What if

615
00:33:38,215 --> 00:33:39,614
Lin Mao really cuts ties with his family

616
00:33:39,614 --> 00:33:41,134
because of me

617
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:42,920
and upsets

618
00:33:42,943 --> 00:33:44,703
his parents?

619
00:33:44,768 --> 00:33:46,970
I don't want him to leave his family
just because of me.

620
00:33:48,574 --> 00:33:50,134
Do you want him to marry someone else

621
00:33:50,134 --> 00:33:51,455
and do nothing about it instead?

622
00:33:55,455 --> 00:33:57,614
Look at this white sugar cake.
It's so delicate.

623
00:33:58,295 --> 00:33:59,935
Everyone says it's delicious.

624
00:34:00,414 --> 00:34:01,414
However, Mao

625
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:03,015
only likes this black sesame pastry.

626
00:34:03,495 --> 00:34:04,814
Only those who try it

627
00:34:04,894 --> 00:34:07,455
will know how tasty it is.

628
00:34:08,015 --> 00:34:09,495
Mao just wants to fight for something

629
00:34:09,495 --> 00:34:10,855
he truly desires,

630
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,679
so let him.

631
00:34:13,214 --> 00:34:14,134
Don't worry.

632
00:34:14,614 --> 00:34:16,455
Before he left, I reminded him

633
00:34:16,815 --> 00:34:18,329
to speak nicely to Father and Mother

634
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:19,504
and not to be aggressive.

635
00:34:20,375 --> 00:34:22,294
If they really beat him,

636
00:34:22,294 --> 00:34:23,134
it's all right.

637
00:34:23,294 --> 00:34:24,375
He's tough.

638
00:34:24,734 --> 00:34:26,855
He can take a few beatings.

639
00:34:27,174 --> 00:34:28,774
If he's beaten to a limp,

640
00:34:29,134 --> 00:34:30,614
I'll go to Lin'an right away.

641
00:34:31,055 --> 00:34:31,895
Don't worry.

642
00:34:32,654 --> 00:34:33,455
Here.

643
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:36,335
Eat this.

644
00:34:36,654 --> 00:34:37,734
Thank you, Second Aunt.

645
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:45,851
(Imperial Court of Judicial)

646
00:34:47,728 --> 00:34:48,690
I'm not wearing this.

647
00:34:49,055 --> 00:34:49,574
Young Master.

648
00:35:11,174 --> 00:35:13,134
Why did you come here, Master?

649
00:35:13,335 --> 00:35:15,294
I don't deserve you

650
00:35:15,815 --> 00:35:16,895
calling me master.

651
00:35:20,015 --> 00:35:21,815
His Majesty has closed the case

652
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,176
and is going to execute Yang Ling
during the autumn equinox.

653
00:35:24,415 --> 00:35:26,694
I've also been ordered to retire
and return to my hometown.

654
00:35:26,935 --> 00:35:28,015
Are you happy now?

655
00:35:28,015 --> 00:35:29,455
- I wouldn't dare, Master.
- Father.

656
00:35:30,272 --> 00:35:31,370
Third Yong Master Luo,

657
00:35:31,375 --> 00:35:33,935
is there really no hope for Yang's case?

658
00:35:34,455 --> 00:35:36,815
I don't mind being told
to retire and leave,

659
00:35:36,815 --> 00:35:39,015
but Yang Ling was framed.

660
00:35:39,094 --> 00:35:40,774
You have to think of something
to save him.

661
00:35:44,455 --> 00:35:45,294
Master,

662
00:35:46,574 --> 00:35:48,415
there are witnesses
and conclusive evidence.

663
00:35:48,694 --> 00:35:50,174
There's nothing I can do.

664
00:35:50,335 --> 00:35:52,975
You know Yang Ling was framed,

665
00:35:53,294 --> 00:35:55,654
and His Majesty has been deceived.

666
00:35:56,134 --> 00:35:57,614
As the main judge,

667
00:35:58,654 --> 00:36:00,409
you failed to discern the truth

668
00:36:00,410 --> 00:36:01,920
and sentenced an innocent man to life.

669
00:36:02,214 --> 00:36:04,975
How are you any different
from the people like Wang Yuan?

670
00:36:08,455 --> 00:36:09,935
The truth is, Yang Ling

671
00:36:09,935 --> 00:36:11,134
was being reckless.

672
00:36:11,455 --> 00:36:12,975
I've said it earlier.

673
00:36:13,294 --> 00:36:14,375
His behavior

674
00:36:15,134 --> 00:36:17,134
is digging his own grave.

675
00:36:17,335 --> 00:36:18,134
You!

676
00:36:19,815 --> 00:36:21,654
So this is the student

677
00:36:22,015 --> 00:36:23,455
I have groomed?

678
00:36:23,495 --> 00:36:24,294
Master,

679
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,970
His Majesty wants you to retire
and return to your hometown

680
00:36:28,496 --> 00:36:30,528
because he appreciates
your past contributions.

681
00:36:30,774 --> 00:36:32,214
If you'd take my advice,

682
00:36:33,415 --> 00:36:35,094
stop intervening in this matter.

683
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:38,455
Very well.

684
00:36:40,254 --> 00:36:41,455
You indeed have a quack

685
00:36:42,094 --> 00:36:45,094
for making smart decisions,
Minister Luo.

686
00:36:46,734 --> 00:36:48,855
If I had known
you were this kind of person,

687
00:36:49,214 --> 00:36:51,375
I would never have taken you
as my student!

688
00:37:00,895 --> 00:37:01,455
Father.

689
00:37:02,055 --> 00:37:02,815
Master.

690
00:37:03,336 --> 00:37:04,078
Get off of me!

691
00:37:05,455 --> 00:37:07,294
Even if I fall and die,

692
00:37:08,294 --> 00:37:10,174
I'll never let you help me.

693
00:37:10,254 --> 00:37:11,774
- Please calm down, Master.
- Shut it!

694
00:37:12,375 --> 00:37:13,815
I don't have an ungrateful student

695
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,120
like you!

696
00:37:17,574 --> 00:37:18,134
Father.

697
00:37:18,375 --> 00:37:19,134
Be careful.

698
00:37:37,134 --> 00:37:38,935
Are you all right, Young Master?

699
00:37:39,574 --> 00:37:40,774
Mr. Sun kicked you just now.

700
00:37:40,855 --> 00:37:42,895
I'm afraid rumors will spread
tomorrow morning.

701
00:37:43,774 --> 00:37:45,855
Isn't this what we want?

702
00:37:50,094 --> 00:37:51,855
Yang Ling, what else do you have to say?

703
00:37:53,455 --> 00:37:54,254
I do.

704
00:37:55,214 --> 00:37:56,094
I want to say...

705
00:37:58,996 --> 00:38:00,360
What's it? Louder.

706
00:38:09,654 --> 00:38:11,815
You should hit harder.

707
00:38:12,815 --> 00:38:14,654
To win Wang Yuan's trust,

708
00:38:15,455 --> 00:38:17,134
this isn't enough.

709
00:38:18,015 --> 00:38:19,294
You should hit harder

710
00:38:19,896 --> 00:38:22,376
to convince him that I confess
out of fear of pain.

711
00:38:23,975 --> 00:38:25,774
If not, you can't gain his trust.

712
00:38:27,574 --> 00:38:28,975
I won't let anything happen to you.

713
00:38:30,734 --> 00:38:33,935
What's there to celebrate in being alive
and to mourn for death?

714
00:38:34,815 --> 00:38:36,214
You were right.

715
00:38:37,935 --> 00:38:39,774
I was too reckless.

716
00:38:42,855 --> 00:38:44,774
This old geezer is ruthless.

717
00:38:46,094 --> 00:38:47,975
It's no easy task to gain his trust.

718
00:38:49,815 --> 00:38:51,134
You're more discreet than I am.

719
00:38:51,975 --> 00:38:54,134
But be very careful.

720
00:38:55,975 --> 00:38:57,094
Protect yourself

721
00:38:58,614 --> 00:39:00,254
and those around you.

722
00:39:05,815 --> 00:39:06,654
I know.

723
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,159
I'm only afraid that Master will worry

724
00:39:13,495 --> 00:39:15,614
and that others might misunderstand you.

725
00:39:30,734 --> 00:39:32,254
What I want to say is

726
00:39:33,214 --> 00:39:35,214
you're forcing me to admit
something I didn't do.

727
00:39:36,134 --> 00:39:37,134
Luo Shenyuan,

728
00:39:37,214 --> 00:39:39,214
you're ungrateful!

729
00:39:39,654 --> 00:39:41,495
I mistrusted you!

730
00:39:41,614 --> 00:39:44,134
I mistrusted you!

731
00:39:54,415 --> 00:39:55,214

Third Brother,

754
00:41:28,455 --> 00:41:30,134
regarding

755
00:41:30,944 --> 00:41:32,410
your situation with Official Yang,

756
00:41:33,134 --> 00:41:34,694
I know you've had a plan.

757
00:41:35,214 --> 00:41:37,415
But have you considered
the consequences?

758
00:41:41,024 --> 00:41:42,816
I won't be able to achieve my goal

759
00:41:43,104 --> 00:41:44,450
if I don't enter the tiger's lair.

760
00:41:45,815 --> 00:41:47,055
I'm worried about you.

761
00:41:47,815 --> 00:41:49,254
The lair is treacherous.

762
00:41:49,495 --> 00:41:51,174
What if you can't achieve your goal

763
00:41:51,654 --> 00:41:54,094
and instead put yourself in danger?

764
00:41:56,975 --> 00:41:58,935
This is something I must do.

765
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,601
Well done. Nice bit.

766
00:42:16,544 --> 00:42:17,850
Greetings, Chancellor Wang.

767
00:42:18,455 --> 00:42:20,134
You're here, Marquis Lu. Have a seat.

768
00:42:31,294 --> 00:42:32,094
All right.

769
00:42:33,015 --> 00:42:34,415
Give us the room.

770
00:42:34,855 --> 00:42:35,495
Yes.

771
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:50,720
(The 13th day of the fifth month)
Look at this.

772
00:42:52,055 --> 00:42:53,975
(Wang Yuan, Lu Jiaxue)
Golden-armored General,

773
00:42:54,134 --> 00:42:56,254
you'd better do your job.

774
00:42:56,254 --> 00:42:58,294
If you disobey me again,

775
00:42:59,935 --> 00:43:00,975
I will

776
00:43:01,574 --> 00:43:03,254
roast you

777
00:43:03,254 --> 00:43:04,495
over the fire.

778
00:43:09,975 --> 00:43:11,614
Yang Ling's case has been concluded.

779
00:43:11,728 --> 00:43:13,410
You can rest assured, Chancellor Wang.

780
00:43:13,895 --> 00:43:16,815
The incident in Quanzhou
was interesting.

781
00:43:17,134 --> 00:43:18,375
I wonder

782
00:43:18,935 --> 00:43:20,734
who was behind it.

783
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,810
Seeing how Yang Ling
ended up in this situation,

784
00:43:25,415 --> 00:43:27,415
I think he just confessed to anything

785
00:43:28,335 --> 00:43:29,895
to get rid of the charges.

786
00:43:31,815 --> 00:43:32,935
I think

787
00:43:34,055 --> 00:43:35,855
he's telling the truth.

788
00:43:43,935 --> 00:43:45,694
Useless fool.

789
00:43:49,094 --> 00:43:51,654
Burn this Golden-armored General

790
00:43:52,654 --> 00:43:54,055
