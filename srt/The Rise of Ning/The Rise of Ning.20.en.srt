(Adapted from Wen Tan's novel "Chancellor
Training Handbook" from Jinjiang Literature)

00:01:36,572 --> 00:01:38,962
=Episode 20=

4
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:40,591
Xuanyuan.

5
00:01:42,071 --> 00:01:43,791
How dare you.

6
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:45,511
Father, I didn't.

7
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,110
Father, Xuan only cares

8
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:49,311
about studying and writing.

9
00:01:49,511 --> 00:01:51,470
He didn't prepare all these.

10
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:52,470
Who did it then?

11
00:01:55,591 --> 00:01:56,630
Hairu,

12
00:01:57,791 --> 00:01:59,311
did you prepare all these?

13
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,470
Yes.

14
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:03,031
I bought all the exam preparation items

15
00:02:03,031 --> 00:02:04,671
at Wanglou Pavilion.

16
00:02:04,951 --> 00:02:06,071
However, the candle

17
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,630
isn't from Wanglou Pavilion.

18
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,151
I prepared three sets in total.

19
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:11,190
Apart from theirs,

20
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:12,470
I also prepared for Mao.

21
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:14,672
The brush, ink, paper, inkstone,
food, and daily necessities

22
00:02:14,736 --> 00:02:15,550
are all the same.

23
00:02:15,551 --> 00:02:16,871
I wasn't biased.

24
00:02:17,431 --> 00:02:19,831
However, someone didn't want
to use them because she thought

25
00:02:19,831 --> 00:02:20,790
I didn't prepare well

26
00:02:21,271 --> 00:02:23,031
and insisted on preparing the items.

27
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:27,670
You are such a humiliation.

28
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:30,630
The reputation of the Luo family
was almost ruined

29
00:02:30,991 --> 00:02:32,431
because of you.

30
00:02:33,547 --> 00:02:34,468
Father.

31
00:02:35,151 --> 00:02:37,431
Xuan knew nothing.

32
00:02:38,151 --> 00:02:39,431
He didn't do it.

33
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,151
He didn't know how to do it.

34
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,271
Recently,

35
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,031
you've been spacing out.

36
00:02:49,991 --> 00:02:51,551
Your studies have declined a lot.

37
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,350
When I asked you questions,

38
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:55,031
you couldn't answer me many times.

39
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,271
In the end,

40
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,431
you had to write down the answers
in your palm

41
00:02:58,431 --> 00:02:59,470
to answer my questions.

42
00:03:00,871 --> 00:03:02,630
I've warned you, Luo Xuanyuan.

43
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,871
But you wouldn't repent.

44
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:07,151
I think

45
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:10,630
you shouldn't take the exam anymore.

46
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:12,470
Someone,

47
00:03:13,031 --> 00:03:14,470
drag him to the Ancestral Shrine

48
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,630
and punish him!

49
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:16,470
- Father!
- Father!

50
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,151
I did it!

51
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:26,431
Yilian,

52
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:27,991
why did you do this?

53
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,790
It's all my fault.

54
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,190
I made my own decision

55
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,871
for Xuan's sake.

56
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:34,829
Xuan knew nothing about this.

57
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:36,032
If you want to punish someone,

58
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,392
punish me instead, Father.

59
00:03:41,551 --> 00:03:43,230
You can punish me however you want.

60
00:03:43,591 --> 00:03:44,991
Don't affect Xuan's exam

61
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:47,431
because of me.

62
00:03:51,031 --> 00:03:52,950
Where are the items
your mother prepared for you?

63
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:57,470
They...

64
00:03:58,831 --> 00:04:00,031
They are in the room.

65
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:00,991
Bring them with you

66
00:04:01,278 --> 00:04:02,477
and attend the exam.

67
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:04,070
Don't come back

68
00:04:04,431 --> 00:04:05,871
if you don't succeed.

69
00:04:06,831 --> 00:04:07,670
As for you,

70
00:04:08,551 --> 00:04:10,190
go to the Ancestral Shrine and kneel.

71
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,271
Don't think about getting up

72
00:04:13,831 --> 00:04:15,431
if Xuan doesn't succeed.

73
00:04:32,831 --> 00:04:33,631
Yixiu.

74
00:04:38,965 --> 00:04:40,445
I... I am leaving.

75
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:44,631
What if I don't succeed in the exam?

76
00:04:44,631 --> 00:04:46,550
Isn't that to be expected?

77
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:47,790
Right.

78
00:04:48,751 --> 00:04:49,550
Oh.

79
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:50,910
Why did you

80
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:52,271
visit Her Highness previously?

81
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:53,631
Oh, do you still remember

82
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:54,559
Han Zhao?

83
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,160
He is Her Highness's son.

84
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,631
Are you serious?

85
00:04:58,825 --> 00:05:00,226
Why am I telling you this?

86
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,480
Yixiu.

87
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,751
I said that to my sister

88
00:05:04,751 --> 00:05:05,550
because someone

89
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:07,151
thought merchants like us were lowly.

90
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:08,599
I was anxious

91
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,961
and ran my mouth.

92
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:12,051
I wasn't against you on purpose.

93
00:05:13,591 --> 00:05:14,951
I know my mistake.

94
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:17,271
Where's Lin Mao?

95
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:18,831
Where did he go again?

96
00:05:19,391 --> 00:05:20,951
I'll come and find you after the exam.

97
00:05:20,951 --> 00:05:22,591
Don't be angry. I'm leaving.

98
00:05:29,271 --> 00:05:30,071
Forget it.

99
00:05:30,071 --> 00:05:31,631
Even Emperor Wenchang can't save him.

100
00:05:46,670 --> 00:05:47,591
Everything is ready.

101
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:48,591
All right.

102
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:50,230
Don't worry, Mother.

103
00:05:50,831 --> 00:05:51,470
That's good.

104
00:05:54,711 --> 00:05:56,071
Don't be careless during the exam.

105
00:05:57,191 --> 00:05:58,151
Do well in the exam.

106
00:06:02,711 --> 00:06:04,151
You are still soft-hearted.

107
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,350
Xuan still doesn't know.

108
00:06:07,744 --> 00:06:10,190
Studying so hard for the exam
that happens once every three years.

109
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,430
I don't really want to ruin him.

110
00:06:15,831 --> 00:06:17,670
Luo Yilian might have an impure heart

111
00:06:18,031 --> 00:06:19,151
but she is foolish.

112
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,631
Her tricks

113
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:21,951
won't fool you.

114
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,071
If she doesn't offend me,

115
00:06:24,071 --> 00:06:25,430
I won't cause any trouble.

116
00:06:25,951 --> 00:06:27,350
But if she involves you,

117
00:06:27,591 --> 00:06:28,870
I won't forgive her.

118
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,454
(Examination Hall)

119
00:06:39,511 --> 00:06:40,031
I'm going.

120
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:40,790
Go on.

121
00:06:41,191 --> 00:06:42,230
Do well in your exam.

122
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,350
I know.

123
00:06:44,591 --> 00:06:45,591
Oh, Third Brother.

124
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,470
I almost forgot.

125
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:48,816
- What is it?
- Come here quickly.

126
00:06:51,631 --> 00:06:53,670
Third Brother, break one off.

127
00:06:59,191 --> 00:07:00,071
That's great.

128
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:01,870
I'm sure
you can get first place this time.

129
00:07:02,831 --> 00:07:03,751
Thank you.

130
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,071
Keep it for me.

131
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:07,870
I'll go in now.

132
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,400
(Examination Hall)

133
00:07:22,071 --> 00:07:22,870
Luo Yining!

134
00:07:23,191 --> 00:07:25,511
You wanted to harm Xuan, right?

135
00:07:26,768 --> 00:07:28,790
You were the one
who wanted to harm Third Brother

136
00:07:29,232 --> 00:07:31,376
because you were afraid
that he would do better than Xuan

137
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:33,088
and affect your position
in Luo Residence.

138
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,950
Nonsense!

139
00:07:34,031 --> 00:07:34,951
I didn't.

140
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,191
Xuan is the best.

141
00:07:37,191 --> 00:07:39,031
Don't think I couldn't notice

142
00:07:39,031 --> 00:07:40,870
what you did to Third Brother's items.

143
00:07:41,031 --> 00:07:42,550
I heard a lot about this

144
00:07:42,631 --> 00:07:44,470
when I was in the side yard.

145
00:07:45,071 --> 00:07:46,271
I only tampered with

146
00:07:46,271 --> 00:07:48,191
what Lin Hairu gave Third Brother.

147
00:07:48,631 --> 00:07:50,071
I didn't put any candles with notes

148
00:07:50,071 --> 00:07:51,391
for Xuan.

149
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:53,550
You were the one
who put it in Xuan's basket

150
00:07:53,591 --> 00:07:54,831
to harm Xuan.

151
00:07:58,071 --> 00:07:59,071
Are you admitting to it?

152
00:08:02,631 --> 00:08:03,990
I am just giving you

153
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,271
a taste of your own medicine.

154
00:08:05,711 --> 00:08:06,191
You...

155
00:08:06,951 --> 00:08:08,591
You even worked with Lin Hairu

156
00:08:09,031 --> 00:08:11,271
to purposely make Father check it,
right?

157
00:08:11,271 --> 00:08:13,430
You always think
people are trying to harm you

158
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,631
and end up harming yourself instead.

159
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:18,831
You should reflect on your mistakes.

160
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,085
(Examination Hall)

161
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:43,670
We are free!

162
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,790
Sixth Uncle.

163
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:48,231
- Shenyuan.
- Aren't you tired from the exam?

164
00:08:49,231 --> 00:08:50,151
Why should I feel tired?

165
00:08:50,231 --> 00:08:52,271
I'm feeling reborn now.

166
00:08:52,271 --> 00:08:54,670
We will get drunk tonight.

167
00:08:55,231 --> 00:08:56,471
Did Sixth Uncle do well?

168
00:08:57,830 --> 00:08:59,070
It's none of your business.

169
00:08:59,471 --> 00:09:01,271
I admit I might do badly

170
00:09:01,351 --> 00:09:02,231
but I don't cheat.

171
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:03,751
Uncle,

172
00:09:03,904 --> 00:09:05,952
the horse carriage is over there.
Let's go.

173
00:09:06,231 --> 00:09:06,991
Let's go.

174
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,163
(Ranking)

175
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,240
Madam, look.

176
00:09:32,751 --> 00:09:33,790
I am Liu Jing.

177
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,151
Greetings, Madam Chen.

178
00:09:38,631 --> 00:09:39,430
First Lady.

179
00:09:45,511 --> 00:09:46,310
Mother.

180
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:47,550
Do I really

181
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,991
need to marry into the Liu family?

182
00:09:49,751 --> 00:09:50,790
Your grandma

183
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,190
just mentioned it.

184
00:09:52,231 --> 00:09:53,271
It isn't decided yet.

185
00:09:53,631 --> 00:09:55,471
Let's look at the ranking first.

186
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,749
I told you to hurry.

187
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,950
There are so many people.
We can't even move to the front.

188
00:10:09,031 --> 00:10:10,471
Yes. It's all my fault.

189
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:12,471
I'll let you stand on my shoulder later.

190
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:13,471
Fine.

191
00:10:14,351 --> 00:10:15,590
The ranking is released!

192
00:10:17,031 --> 00:10:18,271
Back up.

193
00:10:18,631 --> 00:10:19,231
Back up.

194
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,475
(Ranking)

195
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,913
(34th, Luo Xuanyuan)

196
00:11:02,991 --> 00:11:04,190
Xuan is in the ranking!

197
00:11:04,271 --> 00:11:05,590
Look! He is 34th!

198
00:11:06,471 --> 00:11:07,351
That's great.

199
00:11:07,351 --> 00:11:09,471
My young lady
doesn't need to kneel anymore.

200
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:14,550
Xuan did not

201
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,670
let his years of study down.

202
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,351
Unlike my younger brother, Lin Mao.

203
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:20,390
He probably figured
he wouldn't be on the ranking

204
00:11:20,391 --> 00:11:22,271
so he dared not come and see.

205
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,320
(21th Place, Liu Jing)

206
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:33,790
First Lady,

207
00:11:34,991 --> 00:11:35,790
I'm on the ranking.

208
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:39,231
I see it.

209
00:11:39,231 --> 00:11:41,070
Mother said we will propose
at the Luo Residence

210
00:11:41,271 --> 00:11:42,471
when I succeed in the exam.

211
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,031
I will inform my parents right away.

212
00:11:44,256 --> 00:11:45,750
I will prepare all the necessary rituals

213
00:11:45,751 --> 00:11:47,151
and not let you down, First Lady.

214
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:49,790
Please wait for my good news.

215
00:12:38,693 --> 00:12:40,700
(Provincial Scholar, Luo Shenyuan)

216
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:42,471
Third Brother!

217
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,590
You are the provincial scholar!

218
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,761
(Provincial Scholar, Luo Shenyuan)

219
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:11,590
- That's great, Third Brother!
- All right.

220
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:12,670
Not so loud.

221
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:14,751
- I knew you could do it!
- Not so loud!

222
00:13:14,864 --> 00:13:16,736
- Shenyuan.
- Congratulations, Third Young Master.

223
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,280
Congratulations on getting first place.

224
00:13:18,288 --> 00:13:19,870
Thank you, Mother. Thank you, Sister.

225
00:13:20,351 --> 00:13:21,871
Is he the provincial scholar?

226
00:13:22,031 --> 00:13:22,871
He is a great man.

227
00:13:22,871 --> 00:13:23,790
Thank you.

228
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:26,391
Young Master,
my daughter is still single.

229
00:13:26,464 --> 00:13:27,040
Young Master,

230
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:29,430
why don't you come home with me?

231
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,031
Young Master!

232
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:38,592
They are on the ranking!

233
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:39,670
They are on the ranking!

234
00:13:40,231 --> 00:13:43,830
Great news!

235
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:46,751
They are on the ranking!

236
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:48,670
Who?

237
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:51,031
Eighth Young Master is in 34th place.

238
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,031
Great!

239
00:13:52,751 --> 00:13:53,550
Mother,

240
00:13:54,031 --> 00:13:56,151
I congratulate you.

241
00:13:56,471 --> 00:13:57,550
Congratulations, Mother.

242
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,751
Congratulations, Chengzhang.

243
00:13:58,991 --> 00:14:00,950
What about other young masters?

244
00:14:01,031 --> 00:14:02,070
Old Madam.

245
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,391
Third Young Master too.

246
00:14:05,584 --> 00:14:06,750
Is he on the ranking too?

247
00:14:07,031 --> 00:14:08,991
Third Young Master
is the provincial scholar.

248
00:14:08,991 --> 00:14:09,830
Provincial scholar?

249
00:14:10,351 --> 00:14:11,631
Tell me slowly.

250
00:14:11,631 --> 00:14:12,830
Tell me word by word.

251
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:14,231
Tell me loudly.

252
00:14:15,830 --> 00:14:17,231
Congratulations, Old Madam!

253
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:20,590
Third Young Master
Luo Shenyuan got first place.

254
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:21,888
He is the provincial scholar!

255
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,550
Congratulations, Old Madam!

256
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:27,031
Congratulations, Second Master!

257
00:14:27,031 --> 00:14:28,031
Congratulations, Mother.

258
00:14:48,231 --> 00:14:49,869
Enough. Stop smiling.

259
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:52,080
You've been smiling all the way.
Isn't your face tired?

260
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:54,351
I only heard about

261
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:55,950
stealing a groom
in front of the ranking.

262
00:14:56,231 --> 00:14:57,590
I'm impressed

263
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:59,151
after witnessing it in person.

264
00:14:59,391 --> 00:15:00,550
Thankfully, I escaped.

265
00:15:00,768 --> 00:15:03,040
Otherwise, I might be
kidnapped to someone else's residence.

266
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,270
I hope you will

267
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:05,808
become the grand provincial scholar soon

268
00:15:05,824 --> 00:15:07,150
and later become the imperial scholar.

269
00:15:07,150 --> 00:15:09,648
Then, you'll have more people
to grab you in front of the ranking.

270
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,481
However,

271
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:12,231
I think people will soon

272
00:15:12,231 --> 00:15:13,670
come to our residence to propose.

273
00:15:13,751 --> 00:15:16,031
When the time comes,
I will have a sister-in-law.

274
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:17,991
Why do you always think about

275
00:15:17,991 --> 00:15:18,950
something pointless?

276
00:15:19,231 --> 00:15:20,751
How is this pointless?

277
00:15:21,031 --> 00:15:23,670
Will you not get married forever?

278
00:15:24,031 --> 00:15:26,031
If I can't marry the person I like,

279
00:15:26,471 --> 00:15:28,351
I won't get married at all.

280
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:29,351
All right.

281
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,031
I hope you will

282
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:32,848
meet the person you like
as soon as possible.

283
00:15:33,031 --> 00:15:35,471
Then, I'll have a sister-in-law
as soon as possible.

284
00:15:51,871 --> 00:15:54,550
Marquis, there's only a nameless grave

285
00:15:54,751 --> 00:15:56,590
around the side yard.

286
00:16:15,031 --> 00:16:15,830
Dig it.

287
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:17,471
Get digging.

288
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:17,671
Marquis,

289
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:23,231
looking at the body,
it is indeed a female corpse.

290
00:17:26,592 --> 00:17:28,480
What about the thing
I asked you to investigate?

291
00:17:34,471 --> 00:17:36,751
When Seventh Lady
was living in the side yard,

292
00:17:37,511 --> 00:17:39,590
a close servant of hers did pass away.

293
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:43,431
Was her name Xu Mei?

294
00:17:44,471 --> 00:17:45,271
Her name

295
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:47,471
was Mei indeed.

296
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:03,150
Bury her well.

297
00:18:18,471 --> 00:18:19,229
Give the order

298
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:20,992
for all estates
to take a break for three days.

299
00:18:21,110 --> 00:18:21,911
Yes, Madam.

300
00:18:24,752 --> 00:18:27,376
Third Young Master, congratulations on
becoming the provincial scholar.

301
00:18:27,671 --> 00:18:28,830
Let's share the joy.

302
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:30,031
Rui Xiang, scatter the money.

303
00:18:30,031 --> 00:18:30,669
Yes.

304
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:33,248
Everyone, please take a piece
of the Luo Residence's luck with you!

305
00:18:34,031 --> 00:18:37,471
Thank you, Madam Lin!

306
00:18:37,511 --> 00:18:38,590
Thank you, Madam Lin!

307
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:39,751
Thank you.

308
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:41,951
Thank you, Madam Lin!

309
00:18:41,991 --> 00:18:43,310
Congratulations!

310
00:18:47,471 --> 00:18:48,751
Thank you, Madam Lin!

311
00:18:49,110 --> 00:18:49,751
Mine!

312
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:51,191
Give me one!

313
00:18:51,191 --> 00:18:51,951
This is mine!

314
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:52,830
Congratulations!

315
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,110
Thank you, Madam Lin!

316
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:55,911
Thank you!

317
00:18:56,271 --> 00:18:57,630
Greetings, Grandma.

318
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:01,070
Stand up.

319
00:19:03,231 --> 00:19:04,031
- Yes.
- Yes.

320
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:08,991
Shenyuan and Xuanyuan
are both on the ranking.

321
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,711
This is an auspicious event

322
00:19:10,711 --> 00:19:11,951
for the Luo family.

323
00:19:11,951 --> 00:19:14,271
The residence
has organized a banquet today.

324
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:17,350
Everyone should gather
and enjoy the occasion.

325
00:19:17,471 --> 00:19:19,271
None of you should miss it.

326
00:19:20,464 --> 00:19:22,150
- Thank you, Grandma.
- Thank you, Grandma.

327
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,070
Why are you thanking me?

328
00:19:24,471 --> 00:19:27,191
Your father was the one
who asked to prepare the banquet.

329
00:19:29,951 --> 00:19:30,951
Thank you, Father.

330
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,511
Mother is back from scattering money.

331
00:19:39,751 --> 00:19:40,991
Mother, congratulations.

332
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:44,991
You are glowing.

333
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:46,870
How much money did you scatter?

334
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:47,870
Not a lot.

335
00:19:48,016 --> 00:19:49,550
Yuan has lived up to our expectations.

336
00:19:49,550 --> 00:19:50,751
Isn't it a joyous occasion?

337
00:19:50,751 --> 00:19:53,070
Right now, you are
the mother of a provincial scholar.

338
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,590
You should feel happy indeed.

339
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,790
Chengzhang, when you are free,

340
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,431
bring Hairu to the temple

341
00:19:58,431 --> 00:19:59,630
to thank the gods.

342
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:01,471
Yes, Mother.

343
00:20:02,471 --> 00:20:04,870
Mother, I made you spend money.

344
00:20:04,951 --> 00:20:06,271
How is that spending money?

345
00:20:06,471 --> 00:20:07,951
You are making me proud.

346
00:20:08,271 --> 00:20:10,590
Mother, you should be frugal.

347
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:13,070
The academy exam
and imperial exam are up next.

348
00:20:13,231 --> 00:20:14,550
Don't worry.

349
00:20:15,031 --> 00:20:16,630
As long as Yuan does well,

350
00:20:16,751 --> 00:20:19,390
I will scatter as much money as I want.

351
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:22,350
Chengwen.

352
00:20:22,671 --> 00:20:24,671
Don't be too disappointed.

353
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:26,191
You might not succeed this time

354
00:20:26,231 --> 00:20:28,630
but there are more opportunities
in the future.

355
00:20:29,031 --> 00:20:30,671
Yes, Mother.

356
00:20:34,704 --> 00:20:36,590
You might have become
the provincial scholar

357
00:20:36,951 --> 00:20:39,390
but your road to become
the imperial scholar has just begun.

358
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:41,870
You must not be proud.

359
00:20:42,048 --> 00:20:43,990
The Spring Examination
and the Imperial Examination

360
00:20:44,431 --> 00:20:46,191
are the ones
that will test your ability.

361
00:20:47,711 --> 00:20:48,511
Yes.

362
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:51,390
Xuanyuan.

363
00:20:52,431 --> 00:20:53,630
You must not be lazy.

364
00:20:54,191 --> 00:20:56,751
You still have an opportunity
at the academy examination.

365
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,751
Yes, Father.

366
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:27,991
I've begged Father.

367
00:21:28,471 --> 00:21:29,870
Father allowed you to stop kneeling

368
00:21:30,031 --> 00:21:32,150
but you will be confined
in Bilian Pavilion.

369
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:34,951
I heard about it.

370
00:21:35,031 --> 00:21:36,150
You are on the ranking.

371
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,830
Father must be very happy.

372
00:21:38,191 --> 00:21:39,550
No one will dare look down on us again

373
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,231
in this residence.

374
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:44,630
Xuan, what's wrong?

375
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:47,471
Why are you still not happy?

376
00:21:47,671 --> 00:21:49,031
Why should I be happy about it?

377
00:21:49,536 --> 00:21:51,232
I was only successful
in the examination.

378
00:21:51,296 --> 00:21:53,344
How can I match someone
who became a provincial scholar?

379
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:01,191
Young Lady, are you all right?

380
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:11,031
Shan is the provincial scholar?

381
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:14,271
Young Lady, it was
the one from Jimo House

382
00:22:14,471 --> 00:22:16,231
who became the provincial scholar.

383
00:22:27,150 --> 00:22:27,951
Mother.

384
00:22:29,951 --> 00:22:30,751
Kneel!

385
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:38,390
I only failed this time.

386
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:40,271
I can just take the exam again.

387
00:22:40,675 --> 00:22:42,116
There are also many people

388
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,360
who have failed many times.

389
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,600
Why don't you compare yourself
with the ones better than you?

390
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,350
I asked you to study well

391
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:48,630
but you just wouldn't listen.

392
00:22:48,870 --> 00:22:49,951
Right now,

393
00:22:50,031 --> 00:22:50,951
both sons

394
00:22:50,951 --> 00:22:52,590
from the second home are on the ranking

395
00:22:52,951 --> 00:22:54,550
but you are the only one who has failed.

396
00:22:55,271 --> 00:22:56,751
Didn't Lin Mao fail as well?

397
00:22:56,870 --> 00:22:58,272
You dare compare yourself with him?

398
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:59,790
What is his background?

399
00:23:00,031 --> 00:23:01,431
The Luo family and Chen family

400
00:23:01,431 --> 00:23:03,031
are both academic families.

401
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:05,630
Your grandpa was an imperial scholar

402
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:07,271
and your father was
also a palace graduate.

403
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:09,630
Your eldest brother

404
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:12,630
was smart since young.

405
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:13,951
Grandpa, Father, and I

406
00:23:13,951 --> 00:23:15,590
are different people.

407
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:17,100
Regardless of
how smart my brother was,

408
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:17,870
he was dead.

409
00:23:18,951 --> 00:23:20,471
You useless fool!

410
00:23:21,271 --> 00:23:23,031
You only learn about useless things

411
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:24,630
and only care about martial arts.

412
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:26,512
Why are you reading
the Ten Tactics of Warfare?

413
00:23:26,528 --> 00:23:27,470
I'm telling you.

414
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:29,671
From tomorrow onwards, I will throw

415
00:23:29,671 --> 00:23:30,951
all of the trash out.

416
00:23:31,031 --> 00:23:32,231
Go to the Ancestral Shrine

417
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:33,280
and kneel for one night.

418
00:23:43,191 --> 00:23:44,671
Madam, calm down.

419
00:23:44,671 --> 00:23:47,191
Shan will surely
be successful next time.

420
00:23:47,511 --> 00:23:48,350
Next time?

421
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:51,271
If he fails again next time,

422
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:52,590
he will

423
00:23:52,991 --> 00:23:54,911
tarnish my reputation.

424
00:23:55,191 --> 00:23:56,991
If my eldest son is still alive,

425
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:58,711
the title of provincial scholar

426
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:01,790
will never got to someone else.

427
00:24:02,191 --> 00:24:03,511
I would not

428
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:05,991
be humiliated.

429
00:24:06,751 --> 00:24:09,191
Luo Shenyuan became famous overnight.

430
00:24:09,550 --> 00:24:11,231
How unexpected.

431
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:12,751
Even Old Madam

432
00:24:12,751 --> 00:24:14,390
sees him in a new light now.

433
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:16,590
Back when he was
just an ordinary person,

434
00:24:16,787 --> 00:24:18,590
he kept protecting Luo Yining.

435
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:21,431
If he gets the top three places
in the imperial examination,

436
00:24:21,991 --> 00:24:22,830
that's...

437
00:24:23,231 --> 00:24:24,711
There's still a long way to go.

438
00:24:24,991 --> 00:24:28,231
No one knows
what will happen in the future.

439
00:24:29,951 --> 00:24:31,390
My head hurts a lot.

440
00:24:32,671 --> 00:24:34,870
I won't be attending
the banquet tonight.

441
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,231
Go and tell Old Madam.

442
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:38,550
Yes.

443
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,653
(Caifu Abode)

444
00:24:47,751 --> 00:24:48,390
Where is he?

445
00:24:48,991 --> 00:24:49,630
Where is he?

446
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:01,991
Aren't you friends with Shenyuan?

447
00:25:02,711 --> 00:25:03,830
Why didn't you

448
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,150
attend his banquet today?

449
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:08,150
Hairu, stop teasing me.

450
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,070
When I think of my failure,

451
00:25:10,991 --> 00:25:13,231
I feel so sad that I can't even eat.

452
00:25:15,231 --> 00:25:16,751
Why are you crying?

453
00:25:17,792 --> 00:25:19,030
What is there to cry about?

454
00:25:19,671 --> 00:25:21,991
It is rare for someone

455
00:25:21,991 --> 00:25:23,590
to be successful after the first try.

456
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,711
You should work harder next time.

457
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:27,953
I will talk to our parents.

458
00:25:28,191 --> 00:25:29,951
The saddest thing I feel is

459
00:25:30,944 --> 00:25:32,990
that you can't explain yourself
in front of our parents

460
00:25:32,991 --> 00:25:34,110
because of me.

461
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,720
I'm so useless.

462
00:25:37,821 --> 00:25:38,900
Don't give up.

463
00:25:39,471 --> 00:25:41,231
Just focus more of your efforts

464
00:25:41,231 --> 00:25:42,991
on your studies in the future.

465
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:45,231
Eat.

466
00:25:45,417 --> 00:25:46,776
I can't eat.

467
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:48,471
Rui Xiang.

468
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,431
Make some porridge and side dishes.

469
00:25:50,951 --> 00:25:52,671
Hairu, just punish me.

470
00:25:52,671 --> 00:25:54,070
Let me starve.

471
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,560
How can I do that?

472
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:58,590
What will you do if you get sick?

473
00:26:01,887 --> 00:26:04,687
I've let you down, Hairu!

474
00:26:11,991 --> 00:26:14,630
I've let you down!

475
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:46,830
Hairu?

476
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:50,870
Why did you come back?

477
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:52,471
I came back.

478
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:55,231
Your joy will now turn to sorrow.

479
00:26:55,231 --> 00:26:57,350
I was wondering why you've changed.

480
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:00,070
- I was wrong.
- I'll beat you to death!

481
00:27:04,911 --> 00:27:07,231
Old Madam,
Third Young Master is here.

482
00:27:20,191 --> 00:27:21,590
It's so late already.

483
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:23,231
What is it?

484
00:27:24,630 --> 00:27:26,431
Grandma, I came here to request

485
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:29,711
for the testimony back then.

486
00:27:33,471 --> 00:27:36,191
You did become
the provincial scholar today

487
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:37,870
but there are still

488
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:40,271
the academy examination
and imperial examination in the future.

489
00:27:40,431 --> 00:27:43,070
How do you know
what will happen to you in the future?

490
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:44,579
I am confident

491
00:27:45,044 --> 00:27:46,524
about not disappointing you.

492
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,361
Good. Sit down.

493
00:27:49,165 --> 00:27:50,004
Yes.

494
00:27:50,262 --> 00:27:51,461
Sit down and talk.

495
00:27:55,448 --> 00:27:56,367
Shenyuan.

496
00:27:57,165 --> 00:28:00,165
If I give you the testimony,

497
00:28:00,543 --> 00:28:01,823
what will you do?

498
00:28:02,085 --> 00:28:02,885
Grandma,

499
00:28:04,229 --> 00:28:06,030
I know about your concerns

500
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,125
but I am not a reckless person.

501
00:28:09,152 --> 00:28:10,816
If my name is added
to the family register,

502
00:28:11,085 --> 00:28:12,284
I will take on the responsibility

503
00:28:12,284 --> 00:28:14,044
of the fate of the Luo family.

504
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,352
I won't put Luo family in danger.

505
00:28:16,804 --> 00:28:18,764
I will also protect Yining well.

506
00:28:19,845 --> 00:28:20,645
What if

507
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,400
I still won't give you the testimony?

508
00:28:23,452 --> 00:28:25,605
If you won't give me the testimony,

509
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,759
you won't speak so much with me today.

510
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,680
I know you've been observing me

511
00:28:31,004 --> 00:28:32,524
during this period.

512
00:28:33,421 --> 00:28:34,502
I'm sure

513
00:28:34,925 --> 00:28:36,685
you have a decision already.

514
00:28:37,645 --> 00:28:40,085
Are you not afraid of the dangers

515
00:28:40,324 --> 00:28:41,645
and death?

516
00:28:42,197 --> 00:28:43,717
Grandpa sacrificed himself

517
00:28:44,764 --> 00:28:45,764
to clear up unjust cases.

518
00:28:46,878 --> 00:28:49,118
Someone must inherit his work.

519
00:28:49,645 --> 00:28:51,766
Since you have preserved the testimony
until today,

520
00:28:52,848 --> 00:28:55,000
I'm sure you are also waiting
for this person to appear.

521
00:28:56,284 --> 00:28:57,085
Grandma,

522
00:28:58,645 --> 00:29:00,085
please believe in me.

523
00:29:01,445 --> 00:29:02,605
I will complete

524
00:29:02,605 --> 00:29:04,205
Grandpa's dying wish

525
00:29:05,102 --> 00:29:07,181
while making sure
that Luo Residence is safe from harm.

526
00:29:51,284 --> 00:29:53,605
Wenzhai.

527
00:29:54,085 --> 00:29:56,205
He is your grandson.

528
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,600
He can't avoid your blessing

529
00:30:02,941 --> 00:30:05,142
and also your misfortune.

530
00:30:32,231 --> 00:30:33,551
Shenyuan,

531
00:30:34,406 --> 00:30:36,527
remember what you said today.

532
00:30:36,774 --> 00:30:39,054
Otherwise, I will be too embarrassed

533
00:30:39,727 --> 00:30:42,247
to face your grandpa when I die.

534
00:30:59,894 --> 00:31:01,015
Don't worry, Grandma.

535
00:31:02,342 --> 00:31:03,261
I will

536
00:31:04,909 --> 00:31:05,790
not forget it.

537
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,800
(Jimo House)

538
00:31:55,909 --> 00:31:57,669
Official Song,
what is the meaning of this?

539
00:31:59,428 --> 00:32:02,069
Well, I'm sure you understand.

540
00:32:05,668 --> 00:32:07,539
I don't accept any rewards
without contribution.

541
00:32:07,540 --> 00:32:09,500
I don't take money
that is obtained illegitimately.

542
00:32:09,804 --> 00:32:12,085
Our army at the border
is risking their lives

543
00:32:12,085 --> 00:32:14,324
but you are embezzling the taxes.

544
00:32:14,334 --> 00:32:16,453
A lack of military funds
is a social issue.

545
00:32:16,454 --> 00:32:18,055
How can I stand by and do nothing

546
00:32:18,056 --> 00:32:19,816
as the Vice Minister of Revenue?

547
00:32:20,911 --> 00:32:22,431
You should know what's best for you.

548
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,961
I only ask for a clear conscience.

549
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,278
(Witnessed by Sun Chengwu)

550
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:40,479
Li Yinglong's accusation of Chen Jiuheng

551
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,121
for embezzling the disaster relief fund

552
00:32:42,297 --> 00:32:43,337
was a false accusation.

553
00:32:43,981 --> 00:32:45,382
(Wang Yuan and Song Yingshan)

554
00:32:45,383 --> 00:32:47,303
(smuggled tea leaves
to gain a huge profit.)

555
00:32:47,328 --> 00:32:48,760
(Vice Minister of Revenue, Chen Jiuheng)

556
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,224
(informed Imperial Court of Judicial.)

557
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:53,039
(However, Wang Yuan's gang
pressured Vice Minister Chen in secret)

558
00:32:53,193 --> 00:32:55,072
(to destroy the evidence.)

559
00:32:55,248 --> 00:32:56,700
(Vice Minister Chen did not obey.)

560
00:32:57,244 --> 00:32:59,599
Wang Yuan ordered
his underling, Li Yinglong

561
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:02,096
to frame Vice Minister Chen
for embezzling the disaster relief fund

562
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,359
causing Vice Minister Chen
and his proteges

563
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,440
to be wronged and imprisoned.

564
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,159
The crime was a false accusation

565
00:33:07,472 --> 00:33:08,591
and it is a case of injustice.

566
00:33:09,568 --> 00:33:10,568
Witnessed by Sun Chengwu.

567
00:33:13,814 --> 00:33:14,935
It was Wang Yuan?

568
00:33:15,732 --> 00:33:18,004
No matter Old Madam
kept this testimony so securely.

569
00:33:19,405 --> 00:33:20,165
Young Master,

570
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:21,910
the road ahead

571
00:33:22,421 --> 00:33:24,062
will be tough indeed.

572
00:33:26,365 --> 00:33:27,365
It will be tough

573
00:33:28,964 --> 00:33:30,524
but I must still finish it.

574
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,699
(Luo Residence)

575
00:33:40,109 --> 00:33:42,309
Young Lady,
you've been strolling for so long.

576
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:43,790
Why don't we go back?

577
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,740
Let's stroll for a while longer.

578
00:33:46,142 --> 00:33:47,823
He hasn't left his room for days.

579
00:33:47,925 --> 00:33:49,284
Is he sick?

580
00:33:51,358 --> 00:33:52,358
Who is sick?

581
00:33:54,814 --> 00:33:56,253
Yixiu!

582
00:33:57,573 --> 00:33:58,373
Yixiu!

583
00:33:59,269 --> 00:34:01,365
Are you still angry at me
after so long?

584
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:02,739
I am fat and ugly.

585
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,061
I dare not be angry at you.

586
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,440
I don't mean that.

587
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,120
You are not ugly.

588
00:34:07,261 --> 00:34:08,341
You are just slightly fat.

589
00:34:09,605 --> 00:34:10,605
I mean

590
00:34:11,005 --> 00:34:12,045
you might be slightly fat

591
00:34:13,022 --> 00:34:14,924
but I don't think that you are ugly.

592
00:34:15,404 --> 00:34:17,525
I think you are plump and cute.

593
00:34:17,526 --> 00:34:19,485
You are cuter
than the most exquisite clay doll.

594
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,600
No one praises people like you do.

595
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,320
How could you compare me
with a clay doll?

596
00:34:23,328 --> 00:34:25,040
Yixiu, just forgive me.

597
00:34:25,501 --> 00:34:27,525
If you forgive me,
I'll do anything you want.

598
00:34:28,086 --> 00:34:29,285
Anything?

599
00:34:29,884 --> 00:34:31,840
Just say it. I can do anything for you.

600
00:34:34,837 --> 00:34:35,918
Recently,

601
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:38,005
I don't know when the war will end.

602
00:34:38,005 --> 00:34:39,364
I can't even find low-quality basil

603
00:34:39,605 --> 00:34:42,005
let alone high-quality ones.

604
00:34:42,085 --> 00:34:42,884
I'll go find it.

605
00:34:43,583 --> 00:34:43,824
Well,

606
00:34:44,404 --> 00:34:45,485
all transactions are halted.

607
00:34:45,485 --> 00:34:46,759
Where can you find it?

608
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,360
Don't worry.

609
00:34:48,111 --> 00:34:49,031
I admit my mistake.

610
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,736
I'll show you
with my attitude and actions.

611
00:34:50,924 --> 00:34:51,724
Wait for me.

612
00:34:55,653 --> 00:34:56,813
Slow down.

613
00:35:02,404 --> 00:35:03,205
Young Master.

614
00:35:03,206 --> 00:35:04,639
Qi An said Senior Daoyan was gone.

615
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,920
Let's head to Dengwen Drum Court.

616
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,720
(Senior Daoyan)

617
00:35:08,838 --> 00:35:12,760
(Dengwen Drum Court)

618
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,525
(Dengwen Drum Court)

619
00:35:28,774 --> 00:35:30,334
Senior, you mustn't go.

620
00:35:31,005 --> 00:35:31,804
Yuan,

621
00:35:32,045 --> 00:35:33,205
I knew you would come.

622
00:35:33,404 --> 00:35:35,404
I've decided.
No need to persuade me anymore.

623
00:35:35,606 --> 00:35:36,966
I got the testimony yesterday.

624
00:35:37,702 --> 00:35:39,103
The mastermind is Wang Yuan.

625
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:41,040
He has a strong influence
in the imperial court.

626
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,000
You can overturn the case

627
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:43,360
by just going to Dengwen Drum Court.

628
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,039
Great.

629
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,360
We finally know who it is.

630
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:56,012
Senior, come back with me.

631
00:35:57,404 --> 00:35:58,404
When I become an official,

632
00:35:59,182 --> 00:36:00,943
I will plan well and overturn the case.

633
00:36:01,165 --> 00:36:02,005
How long does it take?

634
00:36:02,965 --> 00:36:03,764
One year?

635
00:36:04,205 --> 00:36:04,965
Five years?

636
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,361
Ten years?

637
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:08,591
It won't take that long, Senior.

638
00:36:09,284 --> 00:36:11,605
- Don't you trust me?
- Of course, I trust you.

639
00:36:12,268 --> 00:36:13,909
However, I can't wait that long.

640
00:36:15,244 --> 00:36:16,605
I don't have much time left.

641
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:19,727
I can only live for two to three months.

642
00:36:21,872 --> 00:36:22,671
What do you mean?

643
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:24,438
In the last two years,

644
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,960
my coughing disease
has been getting worse.

645
00:36:27,103 --> 00:36:28,142
I didn't tell all of you

646
00:36:28,688 --> 00:36:29,950
to not make all of you worried.

647
00:36:30,591 --> 00:36:32,111
If that's my fate,

648
00:36:33,406 --> 00:36:34,845
I hope I can complete my wish

649
00:36:35,692 --> 00:36:37,692
before my death

650
00:36:37,924 --> 00:36:39,924
so people can pay attention
to Master's case.

651
00:36:40,645 --> 00:36:41,525
That's good enough.

652
00:36:43,205 --> 00:36:44,205
No, Senior.

653
00:36:45,444 --> 00:36:47,125
I can't see you die in vain.

654
00:36:47,125 --> 00:36:48,924
Just let me do this, Yuan.

655
00:36:50,047 --> 00:36:51,567
Otherwise, I can't rest in peace.

656
00:36:55,534 --> 00:36:57,094
I just ask you to do one thing.

657
00:36:57,853 --> 00:36:59,253
After I sound the Dengwen Drum,

658
00:37:00,324 --> 00:37:02,525
blow this case up as much as possible.

659
00:37:04,757 --> 00:37:05,677
Do you hear me?

660
00:37:06,884 --> 00:37:07,685
I do.

661
00:37:09,407 --> 00:37:10,606
I've seen how tough

662
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,170
the path you've been taking is.

663
00:37:14,183 --> 00:37:15,464
Now that you've become a scholar,

664
00:37:17,165 --> 00:37:18,444
I feel happy for you.

665
00:37:19,244 --> 00:37:20,645
If Master is still alive,

666
00:37:22,845 --> 00:37:24,325
I'm sure he is gratified as well.

667
00:37:26,389 --> 00:37:28,724
You'll be walking the path alone
in the future.

668
00:37:30,384 --> 00:37:31,965
You must stay safe.

669
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,353
(Dengwen Drum Court)

670
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,810
(A case of injustice
is waiting to be overturned)

671
00:38:49,645 --> 00:38:52,005
Marquis, should we capture him?

672
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,160
(Dengwen Drum Court)

673
00:38:58,364 --> 00:38:59,165
Young Master,

674
00:38:59,205 --> 00:39:01,165
Daoyan is a moving target now.

675
00:39:01,165 --> 00:39:02,884
Lu Jiaxue will never forgive him.

676
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,244
Should I bring Daoyan back instead?

677
00:39:05,364 --> 00:39:06,364
You can't take him away.

678
00:39:06,574 --> 00:39:07,693
Once he has made a decision,

679
00:39:07,694 --> 00:39:08,774
he will never give up.

680
00:39:12,085 --> 00:39:13,244
Order the Imperial Guards.

681
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:15,088
Place some men here.

682
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,070
No matter who takes him away,

683
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,040
follow that person

684
00:39:18,404 --> 00:39:19,605
and capture him.

685
00:39:19,965 --> 00:39:20,764
Yes.

686
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:22,404
Lu Jiaxue

687
00:39:23,804 --> 00:39:25,205
still won't take action for now.

688
00:39:25,364 --> 00:39:26,165
Why?

689
00:39:29,165 --> 00:39:30,485
To Lu Jiaxue,

690
00:39:31,764 --> 00:39:33,005
Senior Daoyan is a bait.

691
00:39:33,844 --> 00:39:35,045
A bait to capture us.

692
00:39:35,884 --> 00:39:36,685
Anyway,

693
00:39:37,664 --> 00:39:39,924
we should ask our men
to protect him in secret

694
00:39:40,205 --> 00:39:41,165
just in case.

695
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:42,800
Understood.

696
00:39:45,525 --> 00:39:46,965
Marquis, are you saying

697
00:39:47,165 --> 00:39:49,685
we should keep Chen Daoyan
outside the court as bait

698
00:39:49,685 --> 00:39:51,205
to lure his comrades

699
00:39:51,324 --> 00:39:52,685
before we capture them all?

700
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,480
Vice Minister Li,

701
00:39:56,085 --> 00:39:57,605
we've been looking for them for years.

702
00:39:58,895 --> 00:40:00,855
Now that he has come to us,

703
00:40:01,404 --> 00:40:02,645
we can't waste this opportunity.

704
00:40:03,724 --> 00:40:05,444
Marquis, you are thoughtful.

705
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:07,364
I am impressed.

706
00:40:07,364 --> 00:40:09,605
However, Executive Vice Minister Wang

707
00:40:09,799 --> 00:40:11,599
does not want to drag this on

708
00:40:11,724 --> 00:40:12,965
or for the case to blow up.

709
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,704
It should be dealt with
as soon as possible.

710
00:40:14,752 --> 00:40:16,630
Otherwise, it'll be troublesome

711
00:40:16,724 --> 00:40:18,324
if His Majesty finds out.

712
00:40:18,333 --> 00:40:19,333
Three days at most.

713
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,720
After three days,

714
00:40:22,804 --> 00:40:24,324
if his comrades do not appear,

715
00:40:24,724 --> 00:40:25,924
I will deal with it myself.

716
00:40:26,764 --> 00:40:28,244
Farewell.

717
00:40:35,205 --> 00:40:36,005
What?

718
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,080
Daoyan went to sound the Dengwen Drum?

719
00:40:38,192 --> 00:40:39,880
He has been sounding the drum
for a whole day.

720
00:40:39,903 --> 00:40:42,605
He said he wanted to overturn
Official Chen Jiuheng's case.

721
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,830
Ask someone to prepare a carriage
to leave the residence.

722
00:40:44,861 --> 00:40:46,804
Should I find Third Young Master
at Jimo House?

723
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,880
How can Third Brother

724
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:50,400
stay in Jimo House at a time like this?

725
00:40:50,950 --> 00:40:51,470
Yes.

726
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,200
Young Master, the imperial guards

727
00:41:18,205 --> 00:41:19,125
are following us.

728
00:41:22,485 --> 00:41:23,284
Let's go.

729
00:41:27,045 --> 00:41:27,924
Move!

730
00:41:36,558 --> 00:41:37,237
Get in.

731
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:51,961
Third Brother.

732
00:41:52,933 --> 00:41:53,892
Why did Daoyan

733
00:41:53,910 --> 00:41:55,309
sound the Dengwen Drum?

734
00:41:55,310 --> 00:41:56,480
He wants to overturn the case.

735
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:57,799
Even if he fails,

736
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,730
he also hopes to get
the imperial court's attention.

737
00:41:59,822 --> 00:42:01,063
I've also heard

738
00:42:01,142 --> 00:42:02,341
about Official Chen's case.

739
00:42:02,902 --> 00:42:04,382
I heard his case

740
00:42:04,724 --> 00:42:05,965
was presided over by Grandpa.

741
00:42:07,605 --> 00:42:08,364
That's right.

742
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:11,349
The evidence to blame Master back then

743
00:42:12,005 --> 00:42:13,364
was perfectly forged.

744
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:14,960
The case was decided

745
00:42:15,205 --> 00:42:17,364
but Old Master believed in Master

746
00:42:17,408 --> 00:42:18,960
and trailed the case
over and over again.

747
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,284
Finally, he made Sun Chengwu confess

748
00:42:21,284 --> 00:42:23,125
and wrote a truthful testimony.

749
00:42:23,152 --> 00:42:24,560
However, the Imperial Court of Judicial

750
00:42:24,656 --> 00:42:26,090
caught fire the night after the trial.

751
00:42:26,614 --> 00:42:27,813
Sun Chengwu perished.

752
00:42:27,861 --> 00:42:28,821
How did you know

753
00:42:29,206 --> 00:42:30,487
all of this?

754
00:42:35,444 --> 00:42:36,244
Old Master

755
00:42:36,832 --> 00:42:38,960
only met Old Madam
after he returned to the residence.

756
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:40,965
I was sneaking outside the window

757
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,200
so I knew
about the testimony's existence.

758
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:46,200
Before Old Master's death, he asked
Old Madam to preserve a painting

759
00:42:46,205 --> 00:42:48,205
so I knew the testimony

760
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:49,561
was hidden inside a painting.

761
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:52,401
So,

762
00:42:53,232 --> 00:42:54,900
when I just returned to the residence,

763
00:42:55,430 --> 00:42:56,309
you kept asking me

764
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:57,591
about Grandpa's pine paintings

765
00:42:57,728 --> 00:42:59,340
and asked someone
to sneak into my bedroom

766
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,640
because of that testimony?

767
00:43:02,605 --> 00:43:04,804
Did you help me and save me

768
00:43:05,213 --> 00:43:06,853
because of the testimony as well?

769
00:43:07,685 --> 00:43:09,304
That was indeed one of my objectives

770
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:11,360
but I was also sincere in helping you.

771
00:43:11,361 --> 00:43:12,522
You are just a liar.

772
00:43:13,364 --> 00:43:15,165
You fooled all of us.

773
00:43:15,166 --> 00:43:16,325
But I don't want to lie to you.

774
00:43:22,525 --> 00:43:23,284
Enough.

775
00:43:23,284 --> 00:43:24,965
I'll make you pay

776
00:43:25,205 --> 00:43:26,844
