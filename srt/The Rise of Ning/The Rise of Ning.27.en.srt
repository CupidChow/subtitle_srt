Training Handbook" from Jinjiang Literature)

00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,509
=Episode 27=

4
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:39,573
Buddy, she loves
to stir up trouble late at night.

5
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,519
Just ignore her.

6
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,480
I'll go and check on her.

7
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:42,649
Come on. Let's go and drink.

8
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,650
- Come on.
- Let me check on her.

9
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,803
Come on.

10
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:49,130
Stop right there!

11
00:02:51,401 --> 00:02:52,330
Hurry and let her go!

12
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,348
Take him away.

13
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:07,680
Seventh Lady, are you okay?

14
00:03:07,867 --> 00:03:08,707
I'm fine.

15
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:09,707
I'm afraid someone

16
00:03:09,788 --> 00:03:10,984
released Qiao Wu on purpose.

17
00:03:11,147 --> 00:03:12,108
You should be careful.

18
00:03:12,189 --> 00:03:13,228
Don't fall into a deep sleep.

19
00:03:13,418 --> 00:03:14,737
I'll keep an eye outside.

20
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:16,948
Thank you.

21
00:03:25,695 --> 00:03:27,680
(Danhua Abode)

22
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,480
Greetings, Mother.

23
00:03:38,139 --> 00:03:40,180
Xiu, why are your eyes swollen?

24
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,373
Maybe I didn't sleep well last night.

25
00:03:42,929 --> 00:03:44,480
I think you cried last night.

26
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:50,760
I think she cried because of
the incident with Seventh Sister.

27
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,859
Yixiu had always been close
to Seventh Sister.

28
00:03:53,059 --> 00:03:54,818
Now that this had happened,

29
00:03:54,908 --> 00:03:56,375
even I felt restless about it.

30
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,109
The magistrate office is already
investigating the case.

31
00:03:59,282 --> 00:04:01,640
Seventh Lady will be released soon

32
00:04:01,884 --> 00:04:03,398
if she's innocent.

33
00:04:05,617 --> 00:04:06,480
Yu,

34
00:04:06,824 --> 00:04:07,984
you should head back first.

35
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,852
Did you sneak outside
of your room again last night?

36
00:04:28,711 --> 00:04:29,851
No.

37
00:04:29,872 --> 00:04:31,000
There was no one in the room.

38
00:04:31,086 --> 00:04:32,195
Did you think I didn't know?

39
00:04:32,292 --> 00:04:34,040
Did you go and see Lin Mao again?

40
00:04:35,268 --> 00:04:36,068
I...

41
00:04:39,472 --> 00:04:41,492
You should heed my advice.

42
00:04:42,562 --> 00:04:44,539
Lin Mao isn't good enough for you.

43
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,160
I'll never try to harm you.

44
00:04:46,256 --> 00:04:48,620
Even if you don't wish
to marry into the Princess's Residence,

45
00:04:48,723 --> 00:04:50,363
I'll definitely find you a great family

46
00:04:50,444 --> 00:04:52,609
and make sure
you have a glorious marriage.

47
00:04:53,819 --> 00:04:54,619
Mother.

48
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:57,159
Although you're always strict with me,

49
00:04:57,168 --> 00:04:58,912
and you forced me
to marry into her family,

50
00:04:59,234 --> 00:05:00,187
to me,

51
00:05:00,268 --> 00:05:02,080
you've always been a good mother.

52
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:07,200
Why are you saying that suddenly?
What do you mean by that?

53
00:05:08,053 --> 00:05:09,600
To me, Seventh Sister

54
00:05:09,691 --> 00:05:11,211
is like my own sister.

55
00:05:11,421 --> 00:05:13,560
That's why I don't want
you guys to get hurt.

56
00:05:15,018 --> 00:05:16,338
I think

57
00:05:16,731 --> 00:05:18,242
you're losing your mind

58
00:05:18,348 --> 00:05:20,500
from worrying too much
about your seventh sister.

59
00:05:20,672 --> 00:05:21,870
You should rest in your room

60
00:05:22,242 --> 00:05:24,203
for the next few days.

61
00:05:25,856 --> 00:05:27,280
Send Sixth Lady back to her room.

62
00:05:32,324 --> 00:05:33,679
Sixth Lady, let's go.

63
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:43,650
The imperial exam is nearing.

64
00:05:43,728 --> 00:05:45,520
Now, you're telling me
that you want to leave?

65
00:05:46,128 --> 00:05:48,390
My family wrote to me saying
that my mother was seriously ill.

66
00:05:48,699 --> 00:05:49,898
I have to check on her.

67
00:05:51,248 --> 00:05:53,220
I praise you for fulfilling
your filial duties.

68
00:05:54,224 --> 00:05:56,030
However, getting distracted
at this moment

69
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,211
might be detrimental to your exam.

70
00:05:58,288 --> 00:06:00,340
I can't rest at ease until
I've checked on my mother.

71
00:06:00,752 --> 00:06:01,790
I'll definitely do my best

72
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:03,906
for the imperial exam.

73
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:05,360
Master, I won't let you down.

74
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:06,580
You shouldn't let down

75
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:09,120
your ten years' worth of effort
and aspirations.

76
00:06:10,361 --> 00:06:11,560
Master, please don't worry.

77
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,760
(Sun Residence)
Uncle.

78
00:06:24,265 --> 00:06:25,081
Shenyuan.

79
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,759
I had no choice but to seek you out.

80
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,680
How's Mother doing?

81
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,667
It's not about your mother.

82
00:06:28,748 --> 00:06:29,868
It's about Yining!

83
00:06:33,307 --> 00:06:34,219
- You remember...?
- Mother.

84
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,420
(Caifu Abode)

85
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,260
- Shenyuan.
- I've heard about Yining's case.

86
00:06:37,384 --> 00:06:38,880
- Let's go.
- Who told you about it?

87
00:06:39,267 --> 00:06:40,786
Hairu, I told him about it.

88
00:06:40,816 --> 00:06:41,968
You can blame me if you want.

89
00:06:42,155 --> 00:06:43,035
You did the right thing.

90
00:06:43,392 --> 00:06:44,880
I wanted to tell you about it myself.

91
00:06:45,087 --> 00:06:46,931
But Yining instructed me

92
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:47,920
not to tell you about it.

93
00:06:48,387 --> 00:06:49,268
Where's Father?

94
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,296
He's in the study room.
What's the matter?

95
00:06:51,316 --> 00:06:52,760
I need him to write something for me.

96
00:06:53,754 --> 00:06:54,634
Shenyuan,

97
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:56,560
Yining was framed.

98
00:06:56,993 --> 00:06:58,480
You can definitely rescue her, right?

99
00:06:59,249 --> 00:07:00,129
I'll try my best.

100
00:07:14,619 --> 00:07:15,458
Madam,

101
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,241
Lian Hong fainted after she

102
00:07:17,322 --> 00:07:18,322
was lightly flogged.

103
00:07:18,468 --> 00:07:20,392
But she insisted
that she didn't know anything.

104
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,580
Seems like Sixth Lady

105
00:07:21,668 --> 00:07:23,028
is fine.

106
00:07:23,963 --> 00:07:25,043
That's for the best.

107
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,696
Where's the rest
of the pufferfish toxin?

108
00:07:27,712 --> 00:07:29,480
We hid them in the Chen's Residence
side yard.

109
00:07:29,568 --> 00:07:31,536
You need to get rid of them
as soon as possible.

110
00:07:31,564 --> 00:07:32,364
Yes, Madam.

111
00:07:34,324 --> 00:07:35,923
Qiao Wu is such a failure.

112
00:07:36,179 --> 00:07:38,460
How could he fail
to strangle a weak girl like her?

113
00:07:38,768 --> 00:07:40,720
The prison guard
has already reported the case

114
00:07:41,322 --> 00:07:42,920
after he failed to eliminate her.

115
00:07:43,038 --> 00:07:45,240
Now, I'm afraid it'll be difficult

116
00:07:45,248 --> 00:07:46,704
for us to attempt another move.

117
00:07:49,184 --> 00:07:51,060
What about the location
of Mistress Qiao's body?

118
00:07:51,184 --> 00:07:52,720
Haven't you guys received any news yet?

119
00:07:52,842 --> 00:07:53,642
No, we haven't.

120
00:07:54,415 --> 00:07:55,600
And, I heard

121
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,440
the owner of Jimo House was back.

122
00:07:57,507 --> 00:07:58,960
But just in a several minutes,

123
00:07:59,084 --> 00:08:00,560
he left hurriedly after that.

124
00:08:00,644 --> 00:08:02,454
Didn't he go to Sun Jie's library?

125
00:08:02,535 --> 00:08:03,920
Why did he come back suddenly?

126
00:08:04,309 --> 00:08:06,547
Don't tell me he came back
just to rescue that lass?

127
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:08,330
What if he does manage

128
00:08:08,411 --> 00:08:09,680
to rescue that lass?

129
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,920
(Marquis Anbei's Residence)

130
00:08:17,419 --> 00:08:18,220
Marquis Lu,

131
00:08:18,468 --> 00:08:20,108
thank you for allowing me
to return here.

132
00:08:20,423 --> 00:08:21,627
I have no way

133
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:22,880
to repay your kindness.

134
00:08:24,923 --> 00:08:27,080
I'm willing to serve you
for the rest of my life.

135
00:08:27,392 --> 00:08:28,720
You should consider yourself lucky.

136
00:08:29,348 --> 00:08:30,960
In this world, you're the only survivor

137
00:08:31,387 --> 00:08:32,600
who survived after seeing her.

138
00:08:36,203 --> 00:08:37,123
Who do you mean?

139
00:08:37,387 --> 00:08:39,158
Back then, Mei died because of you.

140
00:08:39,424 --> 00:08:40,880
Have you forgotten about it already?

141
00:08:41,459 --> 00:08:42,915
You mean that wild lass?

142
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:46,027
Didn't she fall off a cliff and die?

143
00:08:52,068 --> 00:08:52,987
Song Ziyun,

144
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,142
you should pray to the heavens

145
00:08:55,223 --> 00:08:56,182
that she's still alive.

146
00:08:56,977 --> 00:08:57,937
If not,

147
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:01,800
your fate would be 100 times
more miserable than this.

148
00:09:03,602 --> 00:09:04,920
You better don't let me down.

149
00:09:06,507 --> 00:09:07,307
Your Lordship,

150
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,544
Seventh Lady has been imprisoned

151
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,792
after being suspected of murder.

152
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:33,690
Keep a close eye on her.

153
00:09:39,729 --> 00:09:40,680
She's not the one.

154
00:09:47,939 --> 00:09:49,947
He's not that type of person!
Stop lying!

155
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:08,712
Be honest with me.

156
00:10:10,454 --> 00:10:11,984
She's not Mei.

157
00:10:16,211 --> 00:10:17,851
Take her away and lock her up.

158
00:10:18,548 --> 00:10:19,348
Yes, Your Lordship.

159
00:10:19,627 --> 00:10:20,427
Let's go.

160
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:28,352
My sister's case
had plenty of questionable points.

161
00:10:28,384 --> 00:10:30,350
People involved in the case
are from the Luo Family.

162
00:10:30,352 --> 00:10:31,800
As the head of the Luo Family, my father

163
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:32,881
has written a guarantee.

164
00:10:33,068 --> 00:10:34,120
Mr. Magistrate,

165
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,720
please allow the Luo Family
to bail her out

166
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,264
before proceeding
with the investigation.

167
00:10:37,296 --> 00:10:39,296
The Luo Family is anxious
about its members.

168
00:10:39,379 --> 00:10:41,059
I can understand that.

169
00:10:41,332 --> 00:10:43,129
However, this is a case of murder.

170
00:10:43,498 --> 00:10:45,824
And, we have witnesses
and evidence of her crime.

171
00:10:46,234 --> 00:10:48,590
We cannot deem it as a family affair.

172
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:50,650
Mistress Qiao's body is missing.

173
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,480
Mr. Magistrate, how could you be sure

174
00:10:52,528 --> 00:10:54,080
that her maid was speaking the truth

175
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:55,696
when she said
she died of pufferfish toxin?

176
00:10:55,712 --> 00:10:56,960
The culprit was devious.

177
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,136
She intended to get rid
of all the evidence.

178
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,996
But back then, my sister
was already imprisoned.

179
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:05,652
She could've ordered
someone else to do the deed.

180
00:11:05,733 --> 00:11:07,812
Who did she order around, then?
Do you have evidence?

181
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,480
So, according to you,

182
00:11:09,655 --> 00:11:11,055
the magistrate office

183
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,521
cannot arrest any suspects

184
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:15,106
before the case is solved, huh?

185
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:17,371
Sorry for my rudeness.

186
00:11:17,863 --> 00:11:18,920
My sister was in trouble.

187
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,332
I was just flustered.

188
00:11:20,528 --> 00:11:22,350
But now, the victim's body
is nowhere to be found.

189
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,304
How could my sister
be convicted of murder?

190
00:11:24,339 --> 00:11:25,258
Mr. Magistrate, I assume

191
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,296
you've heard about the incident
in the cell last night.

192
00:11:27,424 --> 00:11:29,100
If my sister truly intended
to silence her,

193
00:11:29,228 --> 00:11:30,840
why was she almost silenced herself?

194
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,200
Scholar Luo,
the incident happened yesterday,

195
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:36,068
yet you've already found out?

196
00:11:36,454 --> 00:11:39,000
You're resourceful indeed.

197
00:11:39,747 --> 00:11:41,168
This concerns my sister's life.

198
00:11:41,684 --> 00:11:43,243
I dare not be careless.

199
00:11:43,987 --> 00:11:44,907
Mr. Magistrate,

200
00:11:45,068 --> 00:11:46,348
my sister has to be safe

201
00:11:46,451 --> 00:11:48,880
for you to proceed with
the case investigation.

202
00:11:49,328 --> 00:11:51,720
I'm willing to pledge my entire fortune
and life as a guarantee.

203
00:11:51,891 --> 00:11:53,590
Mr. Magistrate,
please permit us to do so.

204
00:11:57,152 --> 00:11:58,199
Mr. Magistrate,

205
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,793
Marquis Lu had entered the cell.

206
00:12:23,305 --> 00:12:24,187
Who did this?

207
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:28,970
Your Lordship.

208
00:12:30,188 --> 00:12:31,228
Who harmed her?

209
00:12:31,308 --> 00:12:32,108
Your Lordship,

210
00:12:32,188 --> 00:12:33,587
it's the criminal, Qiao Wu.

211
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,376
He's been locked away
in the torture room now.

212
00:12:35,634 --> 00:12:36,434
You two,

213
00:12:36,544 --> 00:12:38,144
lock yourselves away
in the torture room.

214
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,050
Yes, Your Lordship.

215
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:43,450
Mei.

216
00:12:46,816 --> 00:12:48,959
Mei, everything's fine now.

217
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,870
- Does your neck still hurt?
- I told you already.

218
00:12:50,874 --> 00:12:52,628
I'm not Mei. Let go of me.

219
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:54,468
I told you already. I'm not Mei.

220
00:12:54,588 --> 00:12:55,627
I know you hate me.

221
00:12:55,664 --> 00:12:57,024
Give me a chance to explain myself.

222
00:12:57,108 --> 00:12:59,520
Just give me one chance
to explain myself.

223
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,200
I won't leave with you.

224
00:13:02,428 --> 00:13:03,308
Marquis Lu,

225
00:13:03,428 --> 00:13:04,747
this is a shabby place.

226
00:13:04,828 --> 00:13:06,999
A nobleman like you shouldn't be here.

227
00:13:08,907 --> 00:13:11,078
You! Lu Jiaxue, what are you doing?

228
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:12,218
Put me down!

229
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,744
You're willing
to call me by my name.

230
00:13:13,828 --> 00:13:14,835
Let go of me!

231
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:16,800
Mei, I'll protect you.

232
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,100
You must've lost your mind!

233
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,860
Marquis Lu, you can't
take a criminal with you.

234
00:13:20,864 --> 00:13:22,910
Tell the magistrate
that I'll be taking her with me.

235
00:13:22,994 --> 00:13:23,914
If he needs anything,

236
00:13:23,952 --> 00:13:25,560
he can find me
at Marquis Lu's Residence.

237
00:13:25,747 --> 00:13:26,548
Let me go!

238
00:13:26,667 --> 00:13:27,948
Let me go!

239
00:13:28,068 --> 00:13:29,937
Lu Jiaxue, let me go!

240
00:13:30,491 --> 00:13:31,851
Let me go!

241
00:13:33,387 --> 00:13:34,308
Put her down!

242
00:13:34,787 --> 00:13:35,587
Third Brother!

243
00:13:36,068 --> 00:13:36,947
Let me go!

244
00:13:37,027 --> 00:13:37,867
It's you again.

245
00:13:38,147 --> 00:13:39,588
I have secured her release on bail.

246
00:13:39,632 --> 00:13:41,340
Your Lordship,
save yourself from the trouble.

247
00:13:41,344 --> 00:13:42,060
Let me go!

248
00:13:42,147 --> 00:13:42,947
Third Brother!

249
00:13:43,027 --> 00:13:44,187
Let me go!

250
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,779
I'm going to take her with me today.

251
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:50,110
Those who dare to obstruct me

252
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,468
shall die.

253
00:13:54,627 --> 00:13:55,734
I'll gladly join you.

254
00:13:55,776 --> 00:13:56,900
Third Brother, don't do it!

255
00:13:56,987 --> 00:13:57,787
Don't do it!

256
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,400
Third Brother, don't do it!

257
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,120
If you hurt Third Brother today,

258
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,040
and if I cannot avenge him,

259
00:14:16,687 --> 00:14:18,228
I shall die together with him.

260
00:14:30,948 --> 00:14:32,147
If anyone gets hurt here,

261
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:34,140
are you prepared
to give the magistrate an account?

262
00:14:34,228 --> 00:14:35,160
I've already told him

263
00:14:35,241 --> 00:14:37,120
to look for me at
Marquis Anbei's Residence!

264
00:14:37,645 --> 00:14:38,920
Will you let me go or not?

265
00:14:40,396 --> 00:14:41,595
If you won't,

266
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:43,280
I'll take my own life here today!

267
00:14:48,514 --> 00:14:49,314
Yining,

268
00:14:50,378 --> 00:14:52,160
you're involved in a murder case.

269
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,030
The Luo Family cannot protect you.

270
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,320
But I can.

271
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:56,601
I didn't murder anyone.

272
00:14:57,428 --> 00:14:58,987
I don't need you to protect me.

273
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,561
I just need you to let me go.

274
00:15:05,643 --> 00:15:06,760
Let me go!

275
00:15:44,528 --> 00:15:45,660
You shouldn't have sought

276
00:15:45,747 --> 00:15:47,267
Mistress Qiao by yourself.

277
00:15:48,468 --> 00:15:49,387
Does it still hurt?

278
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:54,030
Third Brother, I suppose
your informant

279
00:15:54,172 --> 00:15:55,891
was the one who saved me.

280
00:15:58,626 --> 00:16:00,000
They didn't do their job either.

281
00:16:01,147 --> 00:16:02,240
You were terrified.

282
00:16:11,075 --> 00:16:11,875
Yining?

283
00:16:12,907 --> 00:16:13,707
Yining?

284
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,960
(Haitang Abode)

285
00:16:21,667 --> 00:16:22,840
Seventh Lady, I assume

286
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:23,760
you fainted because you

287
00:16:23,792 --> 00:16:25,136
bumped your head into something.

288
00:16:25,312 --> 00:16:26,786
You should be fine after receiving

289
00:16:26,867 --> 00:16:27,987
my acupuncture treatment.

290
00:16:28,048 --> 00:16:31,757
I'll tell my men to deliver some pills
meant for blood circulation after this.

291
00:16:31,838 --> 00:16:32,840
Thank you, Physician Li.

292
00:16:33,867 --> 00:16:34,960
Thank you, Physician Li.

293
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:36,587
All right.

294
00:16:40,588 --> 00:16:41,468
Thank you.

295
00:16:42,228 --> 00:16:43,028
Please.

296
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,679
Mother.

297
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,760
Thank you

298
00:16:46,984 --> 00:16:48,960
for always trusting me.

299
00:16:49,907 --> 00:16:51,080
Actually,

300
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,880
your father was being
protective of you as well.

301
00:16:55,251 --> 00:16:57,240
He didn't allow anyone
to look for Qiao's body.

302
00:16:57,451 --> 00:16:59,080
He even wrote a guarantee
for your sake...

303
00:17:07,387 --> 00:17:08,187
So,

304
00:17:08,748 --> 00:17:09,667
Hairu,

305
00:17:10,068 --> 00:17:11,187
I'll entrust her to you.

306
00:17:11,547 --> 00:17:12,640
I'll head back first.

307
00:17:13,227 --> 00:17:14,257
Thank you, Father.

308
00:17:19,202 --> 00:17:20,468
You can rest and recuperate.

309
00:17:20,788 --> 00:17:21,708
As for other matters,

310
00:17:22,224 --> 00:17:23,680
you don't need to worry about them.

311
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,760
You should leave too.

312
00:17:36,532 --> 00:17:37,880
There's no point for you to be here.

313
00:17:52,312 --> 00:17:53,351
I didn't expect Luo Shenyuan

314
00:17:54,012 --> 00:17:56,249
to take her back.

315
00:17:56,747 --> 00:17:58,203
But I heard that Qiao Wu

316
00:17:58,284 --> 00:17:59,760
injured Seventh Lady's head.

317
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,406
She already fainted once
after her return.

318
00:18:02,673 --> 00:18:04,765
She had a weak constitution since young.

319
00:18:06,115 --> 00:18:07,788
I wonder if her injury is serious.

320
00:18:08,369 --> 00:18:10,898
She might suffer a relapse
and fall into the water

321
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:12,656
by accident one day.

322
00:18:13,088 --> 00:18:14,576
It'll be a terrible sight to behold.

323
00:18:16,035 --> 00:18:16,835
Let's go.

324
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:24,480
Young Lady, you just recovered.

325
00:18:24,627 --> 00:18:26,265
You shouldn't walk too much.

326
00:18:26,788 --> 00:18:27,828
I was stuck

327
00:18:27,988 --> 00:18:29,268
in that stuffy room for days.

328
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:31,046
I wish to take a breather outside.

329
00:18:37,586 --> 00:18:39,249
Young Lady, we should go back.

330
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:41,072
It's windy out here.
You might catch a cold.

331
00:18:41,218 --> 00:18:43,031
But I just left the room.

332
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,540
I remember that I brought
a handkerchief with me

333
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:49,680
when I left the room. Where is it?

334
00:18:50,064 --> 00:18:52,120
Young Lady, don't be impatient.
I'll look for it.

335
00:19:10,379 --> 00:19:12,296
Ms. Zhao, it was you indeed.

336
00:19:15,617 --> 00:19:17,421
Seems like Aunt is getting impatient.

337
00:19:17,516 --> 00:19:18,796
She's even resorting to this, huh?

338
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:22,480
Seventh Lady, what are you saying?

339
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,847
I was just worried about you
since you were

340
00:19:24,864 --> 00:19:26,832
standing beside the pond,
which was quite dangerous.

341
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,060
I wanted to give you a hand.

342
00:19:28,143 --> 00:19:29,726
You can stop pretending now.

343
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,880
The man you sent to the Chen's Residence

344
00:19:31,947 --> 00:19:32,804
to do the dirty job

345
00:19:32,885 --> 00:19:33,880
had been captured.

346
00:19:38,187 --> 00:19:40,508
Mother, why did you punish Lian Hong?

347
00:19:40,544 --> 00:19:42,496
She didn't take care of you.
So she must be punished.

348
00:19:44,913 --> 00:19:45,726
Xiu,

349
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:49,148
are you troubled by something lately?

350
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,726
You can tell me about it.

351
00:19:59,769 --> 00:20:00,669
Madam Chen,

352
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:02,390
Second Master is inviting you
and First Master

353
00:20:02,393 --> 00:20:03,585
to Chengjing Hall.

354
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:06,538
Got it.

355
00:20:06,619 --> 00:20:07,419
Yes, Madam.

356
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:14,920
Keep a close eye on her.

357
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,060
Yes, Madam.

358
00:20:25,162 --> 00:20:25,962
Yixiu,

359
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:29,728
my sister, Yining,

360
00:20:29,744 --> 00:20:31,392
Shenyuan, and your parents
are heading toward

361
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,659
Chengjing Hall with an upsetting
expression on their faces.

362
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,312
I'm afraid something big
is about to happen.

363
00:20:35,328 --> 00:20:36,544
What could it be?

364
00:20:37,348 --> 00:20:39,480
It might be related to Yining's case.

365
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:42,970
I dare not go there.

366
00:20:45,714 --> 00:20:46,514
Yixiu,

367
00:20:46,544 --> 00:20:48,016
no matter what your mother had done,

368
00:20:48,032 --> 00:20:49,264
they have nothing to do with you.

369
00:20:49,296 --> 00:20:50,960
You're a kind-hearted lady.

370
00:20:53,922 --> 00:20:55,242
Someone's life is on the line here.

371
00:20:55,512 --> 00:20:56,952
You have to consider it carefully.

372
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:04,916
Open the door!

373
00:21:05,008 --> 00:21:06,273
Open the door!

374
00:21:06,688 --> 00:21:08,512
- What's wrong?
- There's someone over there!

375
00:21:08,979 --> 00:21:09,779
Come!

376
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:10,960
Hurry!

377
00:21:39,588 --> 00:21:40,388
Big Brother.

378
00:21:48,011 --> 00:21:49,760
Big Brother, over here.

379
00:21:59,273 --> 00:22:00,240
Yining,

380
00:22:00,544 --> 00:22:01,952
you didn't swallow any grievances

381
00:22:02,012 --> 00:22:03,600
in the prison, did you?

382
00:22:04,539 --> 00:22:06,468
Aunt, thank you for your concern.

383
00:22:08,034 --> 00:22:10,440
I was lucky enough to survive.

384
00:22:11,387 --> 00:22:13,400
Someone tried to silence me.

385
00:22:13,826 --> 00:22:16,040
Yining, did someone try to silence you?

386
00:22:16,163 --> 00:22:16,963
What's going on?

387
00:22:17,301 --> 00:22:19,021
That day, someone
bribed the prison guards.

388
00:22:19,056 --> 00:22:20,528
They sent Qiao Wu to silence me.

389
00:22:21,633 --> 00:22:22,840
Qiao Wu?

390
00:22:30,308 --> 00:22:31,108
This...

391
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,600
Shouldn't you guys ask Fifth Lady

392
00:22:33,681 --> 00:22:34,800
about this?

393
00:22:36,031 --> 00:22:37,695
Why did you guys

394
00:22:37,776 --> 00:22:38,976
invite us over here?

395
00:22:39,703 --> 00:22:41,140
Fifth Sister was sure

396
00:22:41,221 --> 00:22:42,467
that I'd murdered Mistress Qiao.

397
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,706
Since I was imprisoned,

398
00:22:43,787 --> 00:22:45,880
she would surely think
that I was convicted.

399
00:22:46,108 --> 00:22:47,421
Only the mastermind

400
00:22:47,502 --> 00:22:48,560
behind the plot

401
00:22:48,972 --> 00:22:50,772
will try to silence me.

402
00:22:50,948 --> 00:22:51,867
Aunt,

403
00:22:52,754 --> 00:22:53,840
am I right?

404
00:22:57,665 --> 00:22:58,465
But,

405
00:22:58,671 --> 00:23:00,040
what has that got to do with me?

406
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,040
It's because the person

407
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,360
who wanted me and Mistress Qiao dead

408
00:23:02,362 --> 00:23:03,240
is none other than you,

409
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:04,851
Aunt.

410
00:23:13,907 --> 00:23:16,400
Look at this child.
I'm sure she has lost her mind

411
00:23:16,501 --> 00:23:18,420
after being imprisoned.

412
00:23:18,843 --> 00:23:21,124
Yining, you need to provide evidence

413
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:22,710
when you make such accusations.

414
00:23:23,817 --> 00:23:25,132
I'm the evidence myself.

415
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,960
Someone was looking forward to my death.

416
00:24:19,754 --> 00:24:20,984
However,

417
00:24:21,268 --> 00:24:22,720
I'm sorry to say that I've survived.

418
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:24,840
Drink up!

419
00:24:25,068 --> 00:24:26,187
Hurry and feed her with it!

420
00:24:38,516 --> 00:24:39,355
Luo Yining,

421
00:24:39,828 --> 00:24:41,828
you went overboard
with that act of yours!

422
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,667
Are you trying to kill me here?

423
00:24:46,068 --> 00:24:47,707
Mistress Qiao, you have to "die" here.

424
00:24:48,505 --> 00:24:49,749
If not,

425
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:50,988
the mastermind wouldn't know

426
00:24:51,008 --> 00:24:52,928
that everything was
proceeding according to plan.

427
00:24:53,703 --> 00:24:55,080
You mustn't forget

428
00:24:55,193 --> 00:24:56,314
what you promised me.

429
00:24:56,656 --> 00:24:58,680
As long as you're willing
to testify against Chen Lan,

430
00:24:58,761 --> 00:25:00,800
you'll just be an accomplice
who was manipulated by her.

431
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,040
At most, you'll be sentenced
to several years of imprisonment.

432
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:03,980
You can still reunite with

433
00:25:04,068 --> 00:25:06,187
Fifth Sister and Xuan
after serving your sentence.

434
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,640
I just hope that my two children

435
00:25:07,796 --> 00:25:09,600
won't be implicated.

436
00:25:10,028 --> 00:25:11,147
After my return,

437
00:25:11,227 --> 00:25:12,587
I'll request Mother

438
00:25:12,667 --> 00:25:14,600
to adopt them under her name.

439
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,880
In the future, they'll be
the legitimate children

440
00:25:16,896 --> 00:25:18,688
of the second principal wife
of the family.

441
00:25:18,867 --> 00:25:19,667
All right.

442
00:25:19,748 --> 00:25:21,508
I can rest at ease upon hearing that.

443
00:25:22,032 --> 00:25:23,400
I can die without any regrets now.

444
00:25:31,419 --> 00:25:32,720
Back then, you framed me

445
00:25:32,801 --> 00:25:34,720
for murdering Gu Minglan
with pufferfish toxin.

446
00:25:34,835 --> 00:25:35,635
After that,

447
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,600
you wish to murder me
with pufferfish toxin

448
00:25:37,828 --> 00:25:39,160
and push the blame on Seventh Lady.

449
00:25:39,707 --> 00:25:41,120
You wanted other people

450
00:25:41,201 --> 00:25:42,217
to think that Seventh Lady

451
00:25:42,224 --> 00:25:44,000
was trying to make me
have a taste of my own medicine.

452
00:25:44,368 --> 00:25:46,016
You were killing
two birds with one stone.

453
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,293
That was a devious move indeed.

454
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,895
You're a sinner who was banished
to the estate.

455
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:54,371
What gives you the right to speak here?

456
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,801
Back then, Madam Gu was still pregnant.

457
00:25:57,185 --> 00:25:59,965
You took advantage of her weakness
after childbirth and poisoned her tea.

458
00:26:04,588 --> 00:26:06,000
That's the truth.

459
00:26:06,428 --> 00:26:07,440
What a load of nonsense!

460
00:26:07,722 --> 00:26:08,603
Someone!

461
00:26:08,788 --> 00:26:09,988
Take her away!

462
00:26:10,202 --> 00:26:11,320
Nobody moves.

463
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:13,170
Let her finish her words.

464
00:26:15,248 --> 00:26:17,120
The tea was brought back
by Second Master.

465
00:26:17,611 --> 00:26:19,040
It never fell into your hands.

466
00:26:19,556 --> 00:26:21,516
Back then, I was managing
the Luo's Residence.

467
00:26:21,597 --> 00:26:24,067
You often sent your men
to visit my storeroom guards.

468
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:25,411
Since then,

469
00:26:25,532 --> 00:26:27,171
I started suspecting you.

470
00:26:27,588 --> 00:26:29,280
Until one night,

471
00:26:29,626 --> 00:26:30,626
you sent your men to make

472
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,508
the warehouse warden,
who was an alcoholic, drunk.

473
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:34,860
You even instructed Ms. Zhao
to poison the tea in the storeroom.

474
00:26:34,868 --> 00:26:36,000
I witnessed the incident.

475
00:26:36,348 --> 00:26:38,160
After that, you reminded me secretly

476
00:26:38,371 --> 00:26:39,880
that Gu Minglan's death

477
00:26:40,155 --> 00:26:41,675
would be major

478
00:26:41,867 --> 00:26:43,520
to both you and me.

479
00:26:44,627 --> 00:26:46,360
You were the one who wanted

480
00:26:46,517 --> 00:26:48,020
to harm the second principal wife

481
00:26:48,101 --> 00:26:49,320
so that you could replace her.

482
00:26:49,819 --> 00:26:51,879
Why are you maligning me now?

483
00:26:52,516 --> 00:26:54,168
Who do you think will believe you?

484
00:26:54,224 --> 00:26:56,040
Don't forget. You hired
the cooks from Shandong

485
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:59,043
to prepare the pufferfish feast
we had in the Chen's Residence.

486
00:27:00,467 --> 00:27:01,960
That was the period

487
00:27:02,176 --> 00:27:03,480
you obtained the pufferfish toxin

488
00:27:03,588 --> 00:27:05,000
and kept it in your hand.

489
00:27:06,068 --> 00:27:07,108
Where's the cook, then?

490
00:27:07,988 --> 00:27:09,108
Where's the pufferfish toxin?

491
00:27:09,308 --> 00:27:10,548
Where are they?

492
00:27:11,028 --> 00:27:14,320
You think we'll believe
your baseless accusations?

493
00:27:16,543 --> 00:27:18,720
Tell Butler Bai
to bring all of them here.

494
00:27:30,114 --> 00:27:31,280
Song Zhi had already confessed.

495
00:27:31,328 --> 00:27:32,736
Both of her parents' death contracts

496
00:27:32,768 --> 00:27:33,630
were in your hands.

497
00:27:33,718 --> 00:27:34,840
She had no choice

498
00:27:35,036 --> 00:27:36,395
but to frame Yining.

499
00:27:36,867 --> 00:27:37,907
As for Ms. Zhao,

500
00:27:37,988 --> 00:27:39,828
she wanted to push Yining into the pond

501
00:27:39,923 --> 00:27:41,200
while she was alone.

502
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,340
It's a shame

503
00:27:43,272 --> 00:27:44,668
that I caught her red-handed.

504
00:27:45,227 --> 00:27:46,027
Young Lady,

505
00:27:46,788 --> 00:27:48,040
I've let you down!

506
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,520
You were nice to me.

507
00:27:49,843 --> 00:27:51,508
But my parents serve Madam Chen

508
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,280
as slaves in the estate.

509
00:27:53,610 --> 00:27:54,410
She said...

510
00:27:54,448 --> 00:27:56,100
She said she would
beat my parents to death

511
00:27:56,210 --> 00:27:57,403
if I didn't obey her order.

512
00:27:57,484 --> 00:27:58,392
Say that nonsense again,

513
00:27:58,473 --> 00:28:00,400
and I'll tear your lips apart!

514
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,480
It's none of Madam Chen's business!

515
00:28:02,714 --> 00:28:03,960
I was the mastermind!

516
00:28:04,123 --> 00:28:04,923
Madam Chen...

517
00:28:05,028 --> 00:28:06,856
She had no idea what was happening.

518
00:28:06,937 --> 00:28:07,737
Fine, then.

519
00:28:08,225 --> 00:28:09,306
Tell us, then.

520
00:28:09,387 --> 00:28:10,880
What kind of grudge do you have

521
00:28:10,961 --> 00:28:12,440
against Madam Gu and Yining

522
00:28:12,541 --> 00:28:13,900
for you to harm them as such?

523
00:28:14,739 --> 00:28:16,240
It's all because Gu Minglan

524
00:28:16,504 --> 00:28:18,426
has let Madam Chen down!

525
00:28:22,138 --> 00:28:23,880
Seems like you weren't the only culprit.

526
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:26,832
Aunt,

527
00:28:28,217 --> 00:28:29,231
I suppose

528
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,600
this looks familiar to you.

529
00:28:35,913 --> 00:28:37,600
I found this in your room.

530
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:39,153
This is pufferfish toxin.

531
00:28:45,155 --> 00:28:47,137
Does it belong to me
just because you say so?

532
00:28:50,097 --> 00:28:51,177
This is...

533
00:28:51,554 --> 00:28:52,794
It's obvious

534
00:28:52,985 --> 00:28:54,720
that you guys are
joining hands to frame me!

535
00:28:54,801 --> 00:28:55,962
I can testify to that.

536
00:28:58,897 --> 00:28:59,960
This bottle of poison...

537
00:29:01,489 --> 00:29:03,548
The pufferfish toxin
does belong to my mother.

538
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,200
(Chengjing Hall)

539
00:29:19,361 --> 00:29:20,680
I also overheard

540
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:21,920
that Mother

541
00:29:22,427 --> 00:29:23,800
instructed Ms. Zhao to hire someone

542
00:29:24,691 --> 00:29:25,720
to murder Yining.

543
00:29:25,954 --> 00:29:27,035
Shut up!

544
00:29:28,059 --> 00:29:29,680
Mother!

545
00:29:29,954 --> 00:29:30,914
Just stop!

546
00:29:30,995 --> 00:29:32,914
Mother, don't make
the same mistake again!

547
00:29:33,667 --> 00:29:35,800
- Mother!
- I carried you for 10 months!

548
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,309
I risked my life

549
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:39,440
just to give birth to you!

550
00:29:40,138 --> 00:29:42,640
How could you do this to me?

551
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,947
Mother, I don't believe

552
00:29:45,028 --> 00:29:47,227
that you're a murderer!

553
00:29:47,308 --> 00:29:49,426
Unfilial girl! Go away!

554
00:29:49,507 --> 00:29:50,640
Mother!

555
00:29:51,091 --> 00:29:51,891
Mother!

556
00:29:51,984 --> 00:29:53,689
Mother, I don't want
to believe that you're

557
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:54,630
a murderer either!

558
00:29:54,774 --> 00:29:55,816
Aunt, I assume

559
00:29:55,824 --> 00:29:56,816
you already wanted me dead

560
00:29:56,832 --> 00:29:58,140
when I first visited Mistress Qiao.

561
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:00,470
The horse died because you poisoned it.

562
00:30:00,747 --> 00:30:02,360
You did it so that I couldn't find out

563
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,872
the true cause of my mother's death.

564
00:30:04,051 --> 00:30:06,267
Back then, Mistress Qiao refused
to tell me the truth.

565
00:30:06,348 --> 00:30:08,317
Although I found out
that it was pufferfish toxin,

566
00:30:08,642 --> 00:30:09,880
the cook was already dead.

567
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,227
There was no evidence.

568
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,760
Therefore, you didn't need to act.

569
00:30:13,012 --> 00:30:14,572
Until the appearance of Young Lady Yang.

570
00:30:15,201 --> 00:30:17,320
You were reminded of your past grudge.

571
00:30:21,636 --> 00:30:22,557
So,

572
00:30:25,348 --> 00:30:26,520
it was all

573
00:30:26,601 --> 00:30:27,880
a part of your plot.

574
00:30:29,728 --> 00:30:32,000
If so, I assume you returned here
while pretending to be ill

575
00:30:32,739 --> 00:30:33,720
to make me

576
00:30:33,801 --> 00:30:35,280
give myself away, huh?

577
00:30:35,361 --> 00:30:37,960
I was truly ill.

578
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,957
I just didn't expect you

579
00:30:40,122 --> 00:30:41,960
to be that impatient.

580
00:30:43,465 --> 00:30:44,708
After all, Aunt,

581
00:30:44,879 --> 00:30:47,640
you're the most patient person
I've ever seen.

582
00:31:00,747 --> 00:31:02,684
You're absolutely insane!

583
00:31:02,765 --> 00:31:03,965
Am I insane?

584
00:31:04,046 --> 00:31:05,885
Or was Gu Minglan insane?

585
00:31:06,186 --> 00:31:08,240
She murdered my eldest son!

586
00:31:08,748 --> 00:31:10,588
How could you say something like that?

587
00:31:10,992 --> 00:31:12,320
Back then, Minglan saw that you

588
00:31:12,401 --> 00:31:14,241
were heartbroken
over your eldest son's condition.

589
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:15,760
Therefore, she hired the best physician

590
00:31:16,114 --> 00:31:17,560
to give it one last try

591
00:31:17,641 --> 00:31:19,012
out of kind intentions.

592
00:31:19,259 --> 00:31:20,059
However,

593
00:31:20,427 --> 00:31:22,640
he was already terminally ill.

594
00:31:23,058 --> 00:31:24,217
What has his death

595
00:31:24,786 --> 00:31:26,440
got to do with Minglan?

596
00:31:26,618 --> 00:31:27,920
But she said

597
00:31:29,068 --> 00:31:31,720
that physician could cure him!

598
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,760
In the end? He still died!

599
00:31:35,548 --> 00:31:37,000
He was so young!

600
00:31:37,988 --> 00:31:40,360
He died in my arms, you know?

601
00:31:42,907 --> 00:31:44,600
He was my child as well.

602
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:45,760
I was heartbroken

603
00:31:46,291 --> 00:31:47,600
over his death as well.

604
00:31:48,867 --> 00:31:49,667
But,

605
00:31:49,947 --> 00:31:52,280
you can't just harm other people
because of that reason.

606
00:31:52,467 --> 00:31:54,840
Stop pretending to be virtuous!

607
00:31:56,588 --> 00:31:57,668
Luo Chengwen,

608
00:31:58,139 --> 00:32:00,258
do you think I had no idea

609
00:32:01,363 --> 00:32:03,215
about your feelings for Gu Minglan?

610
00:32:11,508 --> 00:32:12,627
It's a shame

611
00:32:12,739 --> 00:32:14,920
that the woman
you had loved all your life

612
00:32:15,028 --> 00:32:18,200
was a scandalous wretch!

613
00:32:18,481 --> 00:32:19,720
You and your filthy words!

614
00:32:20,336 --> 00:32:21,560
Stop your nonsense!

615
00:32:26,348 --> 00:32:27,187
Lan,

616
00:32:27,828 --> 00:32:29,840
to think that I've respected you
all these years.

617
00:32:30,304 --> 00:32:32,430
I never expected you to make
such baseless accusations

618
00:32:32,588 --> 00:32:34,293
and cast away
the last shred of your dignity.

619
00:32:36,123 --> 00:32:37,123
Chengzhang,

620
00:32:39,513 --> 00:32:40,960
I have witnesses who can prove

621
00:32:44,231 --> 00:32:45,467
that Luo Yining

622
00:32:45,627 --> 00:32:48,547
isn't your daughter.

623
00:32:48,627 --> 00:32:49,600
Nonsense!

624
00:32:49,762 --> 00:32:50,720
Shut up!

625
00:32:50,801 --> 00:32:52,040
Stop trying to drag Mother down

626
00:32:52,121 --> 00:32:53,801
before your demise!

627
00:33:01,099 --> 00:33:02,512
She has already lost her mind.

628
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:04,032
Send her to the magistrate office.

629
00:33:04,186 --> 00:33:05,066
Butler Bai,

630
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,000
lock her away in the Ancestral Shrine.

631
00:33:07,265 --> 00:33:09,960
That's right.
Send me to the magistrate office now!

632
00:33:10,147 --> 00:33:11,468
Send me to court!

633
00:33:11,488 --> 00:33:13,180
Since you are disallowing me
to speak here,

634
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,736
I'll tell everyone about it
in the court!

635
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:15,480
Shut her mouth!

636
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,903
I'll make the scandals in the Luo Family

637
00:33:17,984 --> 00:33:20,788
known to the public!

638
00:33:20,907 --> 00:33:22,099
If anyone dares to stop me,

639
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:24,224
I'll stir up a commotion
until everyone hears about this.

640
00:33:24,272 --> 00:33:25,664
I'll make sure all of you

641
00:33:25,667 --> 00:33:28,800
stay inside the residence
forever due to embarrassment!

642
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:34,551
(Luo's Ancestral Shrine)

643
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:38,080
(Stand Out Through The Ages)

644
00:34:03,924 --> 00:34:05,240
What are you doing here?

645
00:34:06,449 --> 00:34:07,986
When did you find out?

646
00:34:12,129 --> 00:34:16,480
"May we be united by virtue,
hand in hand.

647
00:34:16,896 --> 00:34:18,510
Without flight,

648
00:34:19,634 --> 00:34:21,111
I was led to my downfall."

649
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:25,299
Sima Xiangru's Phoenix Seeking Phoenix.

650
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:27,822
Since you dare to write that down,

651
00:34:29,384 --> 00:34:30,971
why didn't you hand it to her?

652
00:34:33,347 --> 00:34:34,520
How did you find out?

653
00:34:35,168 --> 00:34:36,480
Could it be that the letter was...

654
00:34:39,393 --> 00:34:41,861
You saw that she was depressed
over Mistress Qiao's condition.

655
00:34:42,066 --> 00:34:45,119
Did you intend to elope with her,
just like what Sima Xiangru

656
00:34:46,658 --> 00:34:48,182
and Zhuo Wenjun did?

657
00:34:58,217 --> 00:34:59,538
You're right.

658
00:35:00,625 --> 00:35:03,680
I did write the letter.

659
00:35:04,978 --> 00:35:07,720
But it has nothing to do with Minglan

660
00:35:08,011 --> 00:35:09,603
or Yining.

661
00:35:09,824 --> 00:35:11,360
Minglan was always an upright person.

662
00:35:11,548 --> 00:35:13,260
Yining did nothing wrong either.

663
00:35:13,388 --> 00:35:15,361
Why did you try to harm them?

664
00:35:15,524 --> 00:35:16,600
Minglan, huh?

665
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:22,570
That sounds

666
00:35:23,499 --> 00:35:25,120
very endearing.

667
00:35:27,303 --> 00:35:29,160
You've never called me by my name

668
00:35:30,489 --> 00:35:32,480
ever since we got married.

669
00:35:33,028 --> 00:35:35,388
You only referred to me as Madam Chen.

670
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:38,840
I gave birth and
raised your children for you.

671
00:35:39,171 --> 00:35:41,560
I disregarded
my family's disdain for you.

672
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,440
But in the end,

673
00:35:44,329 --> 00:35:45,800
I was nothing to you.

674
00:35:51,689 --> 00:35:52,490
Chen Lan,

675
00:35:53,553 --> 00:35:54,720
you're right.

676
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,840
I've

677
00:35:58,272 --> 00:35:59,720
let you down.

678
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,922
I've let Minglan down as well.

679
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,352
Follow me to the magistrate office
and turn yourself in.

680
00:36:14,682 --> 00:36:15,682
I'm not going.

681
00:36:16,032 --> 00:36:18,128
Have you ever considered
the feelings of our children?

682
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:20,004
How can Yiyu and Yixiu

683
00:36:21,193 --> 00:36:22,594
find good husbands

684
00:36:23,362 --> 00:36:25,360
if I get convicted of such a crime?

685
00:36:25,707 --> 00:36:26,920
And Shan,

686
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,160
how can he build
a future for himself after this?

687
00:36:29,291 --> 00:36:31,570
You should consider their feelings!

688
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:33,520
What about you, then?
Have you ever considered

689
00:36:33,728 --> 00:36:36,256
our children's future
when you committed all those evil deeds?

690
00:36:36,588 --> 00:36:38,789
You say that you consider
their feelings.

691
00:36:39,419 --> 00:36:41,218
Do you truly care about them?

692
00:36:41,568 --> 00:36:44,480
Or are you just trying to hide the fact
that you've committed heinous crimes?

693
00:36:44,561 --> 00:36:45,361
Bah!

694
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:47,568
Stop pretending to be virtuous!

695
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:48,819
Get out!

696
00:36:50,155 --> 00:36:51,155
Get out!

697
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,555
Young Lady,

698
00:37:20,627 --> 00:37:22,027
you should return to your room.

699
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:23,492
You haven't fully recovered yet.

700
00:37:43,047 --> 00:37:44,760
Don't you have anything to say to me?

701
00:37:45,338 --> 00:37:46,459
This time,

702
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,601
I made Chen Lan act on purpose.

703
00:37:50,108 --> 00:37:50,908
I knew

704
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:52,945
that she wouldn't let me off.

705
00:37:53,619 --> 00:37:55,109
I knew that she would try to silence me.

706
00:37:55,493 --> 00:37:56,293
This is the only way

707
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,336
we can gather evidence of her crime.

708
00:37:58,592 --> 00:38:01,260
And, you chose the period
when Grandma has entered the mountains

709
00:38:01,882 --> 00:38:03,304
to prevent her from getting worried.

710
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,990
You've gone to great lengths
just for this.

711
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:08,272
Coincidentally,
Mistress Qiao was seriously ill.

712
00:38:08,738 --> 00:38:10,218
She had no one to depend on either.

713
00:38:11,354 --> 00:38:12,274
Now

714
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,234
is indeed the best period.

715
00:38:18,556 --> 00:38:19,996
Have you ever considered

716
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,840
what if Mistress Qiao
regretted her promise

717
00:38:22,921 --> 00:38:25,750
or if you didn't manage
to survive the prison encounter?

718
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:27,160
What should you do, then?

719
00:38:28,883 --> 00:38:30,960
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

720
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:32,601
I have to take a risk somehow.

721
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:34,523
It's just

722
00:38:34,604 --> 00:38:35,764
that I didn't expect you

723
00:38:36,039 --> 00:38:37,680
to hear about this as well.

724
00:38:37,867 --> 00:38:39,666
You were preparing for
the imperial exam.

725
00:38:39,778 --> 00:38:41,139
But you left suddenly.

726
00:38:41,275 --> 00:38:42,760
I suppose Mr. Sun would be angry at you.

727
00:38:47,842 --> 00:38:49,160
I'll deal with it accordingly.

728
00:38:50,969 --> 00:38:52,120
You shouldn't stay out here.

729
00:38:52,698 --> 00:38:53,499
Let's go inside.

730
00:38:57,108 --> 00:38:57,908
Third Brother.

731
00:39:00,779 --> 00:39:01,579
What's the matter?

732
00:39:02,345 --> 00:39:03,664
Chen Lan was wrong.

733
00:39:05,395 --> 00:39:07,070
Mother wasn't that kind of person.

734
00:39:10,354 --> 00:39:11,679
Of course she wasn't.

735
00:39:17,444 --> 00:39:18,283
Third Young Master.

736
00:39:18,787 --> 00:39:19,627
Seventh Lady,

737
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,015
Second Master wants you
to head to Chengjing Hall.

738
00:39:23,515 --> 00:39:24,395
I'll join you.

739
00:39:24,763 --> 00:39:25,563
Third Young Master,

740
00:39:26,169 --> 00:39:28,101
Second Master wants her
to head there alone.

741
00:39:28,675 --> 00:39:30,453
The maids may remain here.

742
00:39:36,234 --> 00:39:37,200
I'll head there myself.

743
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:43,547
Shao'an.

744
00:39:46,282 --> 00:39:47,082
Young Master.

745
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,520
Head to Uncle's side

746
00:39:48,544 --> 00:39:49,888
and retrieve a heart-saving pill.

747
00:39:49,952 --> 00:39:51,760
Get me a horse.
We'll head into the mountains.

748
00:39:52,012 --> 00:39:52,812
Yes, Young Master.

749
00:40:23,979 --> 00:40:24,779
Yining.

750
00:40:26,328 --> 00:40:27,760
Come and have a seat.

751
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:43,610
You said

752
00:40:44,058 --> 00:40:46,320
Minglan left
the side yard before, right?

753
00:40:46,752 --> 00:40:48,320
Yes, Second Master.

754
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:50,700
She realized that she was pregnant
not long after that.

755
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,080
I heard Ms. Zheng telling

756
00:40:52,161 --> 00:40:53,600
Madam Gu to abort her child.

757
00:40:53,747 --> 00:40:55,388
But she disagreed.

758
00:40:55,499 --> 00:40:56,459
Ms. Zheng was worried

759
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,280
the timing of her birth
might not match the right time

760
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,600
and that it might arouse your suspicion.

761
00:40:59,642 --> 00:41:01,603
So she bought
some labor-inducing medicine in secret

762
00:41:01,816 --> 00:41:02,840
and calculated the days

763
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,640
so that she could
give birth to the child early.

764
00:41:06,555 --> 00:41:08,394
You're a midwife. Tell us.

765
00:41:08,870 --> 00:41:11,400
Did the child look like
a full-term child?

766
00:41:11,516 --> 00:41:14,680
No, she didn't.

767
00:41:14,866 --> 00:41:17,201
But Ms. Zheng insisted on saying
that she was a full-term child.

768
00:41:17,347 --> 00:41:18,267
I thought to myself

769
00:41:18,459 --> 00:41:21,378
that it might be a case
of congenital deficiency.

770
00:41:21,762 --> 00:41:23,960
Did she use any labor-inducing medicine?

771
00:41:24,155 --> 00:41:25,600
She did.

772
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:28,840
And, she added clove
and musk into the mix.

773
00:41:29,107 --> 00:41:31,000
Compared to the conventional
labor-inducing pill,

774
00:41:31,129 --> 00:41:33,080
it was much stronger.

775
00:41:46,313 --> 00:41:47,673
Do you two know the consequences

776
00:41:48,467 --> 00:41:51,627
of framing the second principal wife
of the Luo Family?

777
00:41:52,388 --> 00:41:54,548
Second Master, I'm speaking the truth.

778
00:41:54,576 --> 00:41:56,624
I can swear to the heavens
that I'm telling the truth!

779
00:41:57,787 --> 00:41:58,920
Now, you've found these two

780
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,200
to tell us all about the past.

781
00:42:00,224 --> 00:42:02,540
How can I tell that you're not trying
to malign my mother here?

782
00:42:02,544 --> 00:42:03,860
After your mother's death,

783
00:42:03,948 --> 00:42:05,868
all of her old servants

784
00:42:05,988 --> 00:42:07,347
went on their separate ways.

785
00:42:07,468 --> 00:42:09,560
Old Madam wishes
to retain the service of Ms. Zheng

786
00:42:09,641 --> 00:42:10,902
to take care of you.

787
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,628
Even so, she left resolutely.

788
00:42:12,709 --> 00:42:13,870
Why was that the case?

789
00:42:14,499 --> 00:42:16,040
Don't you think it was strange?

790
00:42:18,428 --> 00:42:19,347
Butler Bai.

791
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:21,760
Second Master, what do you need?

792
00:42:22,011 --> 00:42:23,931
Bring Ms. Zheng here. Make it quick.

793
00:42:24,556 --> 00:42:25,356
Yes, sir.

794
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:28,178
Take her away.

795
00:42:28,371 --> 00:42:29,171
Yes, sir.

796
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,080
My dear,

797
00:42:31,534 --> 00:42:33,186
Chen Lan murdered
the second principal wife

798
00:42:33,267 --> 00:42:34,588
and framed Yining.

799
00:42:36,076 --> 00:42:37,480
He married you as a second wife.

800
00:42:37,923 --> 00:42:40,242
But you're pretty protective
of her, huh?

801
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,000
So what if I'm the second wife?

802
00:42:42,338 --> 00:42:43,400
Crazy woman,

803
00:42:43,627 --> 00:42:44,840
what evidence do you have

804
00:42:44,921 --> 00:42:47,206
to prove
that you didn't malign Madam Gu?

805
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,194
Am I maligning her?

806
00:42:52,275 --> 00:42:53,835
Or was she an indecent woman?

807
00:42:53,888 --> 00:42:55,840
You guys will find out
after reading this letter.

808
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:59,160
Luo Chengwen

809
00:42:59,241 --> 00:43:00,200
wrote this to Gu Minglan

810
00:43:00,281 --> 00:43:01,681
personally.

811
00:43:10,548 --> 00:43:11,348
You!

812
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,720
(To Gu Minglan: "May we be united
by virtue, hand in hand.")

813
00:43:19,908 --> 00:43:22,680
Gu Minglan was that capable.

814
00:43:22,736 --> 00:43:24,240
She could make all the men in the world

815
00:43:24,321 --> 00:43:26,080
revolve around her.

816
00:43:26,786 --> 00:43:27,800
What a shame.

817
00:43:27,941 --> 00:43:30,061
Your uncle was
daring enough to write it,

818
00:43:30,313 --> 00:43:32,193
yet he wasn't daring enough
to deliver it to her.

819
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:34,130
In the end, I found it.
