(Yanrong Pavilion)

5
00:02:16,968 --> 00:02:19,048
(May the world)

6
00:02:19,567 --> 00:02:21,447
(always)

7
00:02:22,368 --> 00:02:24,167
(be filled with joy.)

8
00:02:25,808 --> 00:02:28,208
(I hope you will forever)

9
00:02:28,488 --> 00:02:29,248
(be happy)

10
00:02:29,808 --> 00:02:30,687
(and with me.)

11
00:03:02,368 --> 00:03:03,208
Grandma.

12
00:03:04,048 --> 00:03:04,887
Father.

13
00:03:05,167 --> 00:03:06,167
Did you ask for me?

14
00:03:07,567 --> 00:03:08,368
Yes.

15
00:03:08,727 --> 00:03:09,887
A war has erupted at the border.

16
00:03:10,368 --> 00:03:13,048
Your father needs to quell the chaos.

17
00:03:13,968 --> 00:03:14,887
This is so sudden.

18
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:16,607
When are you leaving, Father?

19
00:03:16,768 --> 00:03:17,887
I'll depart tomorrow.

20
00:03:19,248 --> 00:03:20,048
So soon.

21
00:03:20,607 --> 00:03:22,328
I'll go and pack for you.

22
00:03:23,607 --> 00:03:25,048
Everything is ready.

23
00:03:25,847 --> 00:03:27,808
Yining, we called you here

24
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:29,607
to remind you.

25
00:03:30,407 --> 00:03:32,208
Your grandma is getting old in years,

26
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:33,368
and Ting is still young.

27
00:03:33,687 --> 00:03:34,648
While I'm away

28
00:03:34,808 --> 00:03:36,248
during this expedition,

29
00:03:36,432 --> 00:03:37,456
I'm entrusting this home

30
00:03:38,007 --> 00:03:39,248
to you.

31
00:03:40,528 --> 00:03:42,328
I understand.
Please rest assured, Father.

32
00:03:42,368 --> 00:03:44,607
Father, you should
take care of yourself.

33
00:03:44,607 --> 00:03:46,648
I've been fighting in wars

34
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,088
since I was ten.

35
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,280
I won't get hurt so easily.

36
00:03:51,607 --> 00:03:53,048
I'll go and see

37
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,160
if there's anything else you may need.

38
00:04:04,847 --> 00:04:06,007
Is there anything special

39
00:04:07,088 --> 00:04:08,567
about this expedition?

40
00:04:10,287 --> 00:04:12,248
What's wrong, Mother?

41
00:04:12,567 --> 00:04:14,368
I have been to war

42
00:04:14,368 --> 00:04:15,847
many times.

43
00:04:15,847 --> 00:04:17,167
It's nothing special.

44
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,688
You never cared about household matters

45
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:21,008
when you went to war.

46
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:22,208
Why are you giving

47
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:24,167
so many instructions this time?

48
00:04:25,407 --> 00:04:27,888
Because Yining is finally back home.

49
00:04:32,528 --> 00:04:33,287
No worries.

50
00:04:50,607 --> 00:04:51,367
Father,

51
00:04:51,768 --> 00:04:53,847
this is the wound medicine
concocted by my sixth uncle.

52
00:04:54,008 --> 00:04:55,528
It's for bruises and sprains.

53
00:04:56,047 --> 00:04:57,407
Please take it with you.

54
00:04:59,407 --> 00:05:00,847
Daughters are always considerate.

55
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:03,407
Did your sixth uncle make this?

56
00:05:04,648 --> 00:05:06,847
He's really good at this.

57
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:08,008
Of course,

58
00:05:08,247 --> 00:05:11,008
I hope you won't need this.

59
00:05:12,167 --> 00:05:13,287
Father,

60
00:05:13,807 --> 00:05:14,407
and this, too.

61
00:05:15,727 --> 00:05:17,528
This is an amulet jade.

62
00:05:17,648 --> 00:05:20,047
I got this for the temple.

63
00:05:25,528 --> 00:05:26,607
There's a carving on it.

64
00:05:26,888 --> 00:05:28,047
It says,

65
00:05:28,367 --> 00:05:31,208
"May the grace shine on you
and keep you safe."

66
00:05:32,968 --> 00:05:33,968
I know

67
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:35,487
you'll go all out

68
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:37,208
to fight in the war

69
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:38,199
without holding back

70
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,936
and are willing to sacrifice
for the country.

71
00:05:39,968 --> 00:05:40,720
However,

72
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:42,607
I also hope you'll remember

73
00:05:43,047 --> 00:05:45,047
that your family is waiting for you

74
00:05:45,167 --> 00:05:47,568
to return safely soon.

75
00:05:49,568 --> 00:05:50,688
I promise you.

76
00:05:51,247 --> 00:05:52,847
I'll return home safe and sound.

77
00:05:56,261 --> 00:05:57,047
Ting,

78
00:05:58,407 --> 00:05:59,367
while I'm away,

79
00:05:59,367 --> 00:06:00,888
you need to listen to your sisters.

80
00:06:01,047 --> 00:06:02,208
I'll remember this.

81
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:06,008
Mingzhu,

82
00:06:06,648 --> 00:06:07,888
in my heart,

83
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:10,407
you're also my daughter.

84
00:06:11,047 --> 00:06:12,407
While I'm away,

85
00:06:12,407 --> 00:06:13,768
the three of you

86
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:15,367
must unite.

87
00:06:16,088 --> 00:06:17,208
I'll remember.

88
00:06:18,768 --> 00:06:19,727
Father, take care.

89
00:06:23,367 --> 00:06:24,208
Yining,

90
00:06:24,768 --> 00:06:26,367
I entrust this home to you.

91
00:06:26,368 --> 00:06:27,360
The more power you hold,

92
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,320
the greater the responsibility
you have to shoulder.

93
00:06:29,328 --> 00:06:31,800
You must treat everyone

94
00:06:32,367 --> 00:06:34,088
fairly and justly.

95
00:06:36,047 --> 00:06:37,208
I understand.

96
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,039
Young Lady!

97
00:07:15,167 --> 00:07:17,247
Young Master Lin has returned,
Young Lady!

98
00:07:17,287 --> 00:07:19,528
What does he look like when he's back?

99
00:07:19,528 --> 00:07:20,167
He...

100
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:21,927
Is he happy or sad?

101
00:07:21,927 --> 00:07:23,487
- I...
- Is he still in one piece?

102
00:07:23,487 --> 00:07:24,175
I don't know.

103
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,801
I haven't seen him yet, Young Lady.

104
00:07:26,047 --> 00:07:28,208
Didn't you go and take a look first?

105
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:29,807
I wanted to tell you first.

106
00:07:29,807 --> 00:07:30,847
He's in the main hall.

107
00:07:31,088 --> 00:07:32,208
Old Madam, Second Master,

108
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:33,208
and Madam Lin are there.

109
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:34,088
You should go, too.

110
00:07:35,145 --> 00:07:36,344
All right. Let's go.

111
00:07:42,047 --> 00:07:43,727
Is this the answer you brought back?

112
00:07:43,847 --> 00:07:45,367
I said this before.

113
00:07:45,367 --> 00:07:47,367
The Luo's Residence
doesn't care about that.

114
00:07:47,888 --> 00:07:48,607
Enough.

115
00:07:48,648 --> 00:07:50,607
Since you can't do it,
there's no need to speak.

116
00:07:50,727 --> 00:07:52,727
Second Master, I'll think of a way.

117
00:07:53,047 --> 00:07:54,247
What else can you say

118
00:07:54,247 --> 00:07:55,568
other than this?

119
00:07:56,968 --> 00:07:57,847
Jeez, you.

120
00:07:58,968 --> 00:07:59,768
Second Uncle.

121
00:08:01,768 --> 00:08:03,208
Lin Mao tried his best.

122
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:04,888
Please stop criticizing him.

123
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,568
Yixiu, you don't need

124
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:09,047
to put in good words for him.

125
00:08:09,487 --> 00:08:11,247
I must speak for his sake.

126
00:08:11,367 --> 00:08:13,047
He's struggling,

127
00:08:13,047 --> 00:08:14,487
torn between two families.

128
00:08:14,487 --> 00:08:16,047
On top of that, they're his parents.

129
00:08:16,047 --> 00:08:17,367
He can't go against them.

130
00:08:20,607 --> 00:08:21,807
What are you talking about?

131
00:08:22,825 --> 00:08:23,705
It's all right.

132
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,968
I will remember

133
00:08:25,047 --> 00:08:26,648
what you've done for me.

134
00:08:26,648 --> 00:08:28,367
Parents are greater than anything.

135
00:08:28,688 --> 00:08:30,807
Don't make things difficult
for your parents.

136
00:08:31,047 --> 00:08:33,288
I will marry no one in this life.

137
00:08:34,527 --> 00:08:35,408
Don't talk nonsense.

138
00:08:35,792 --> 00:08:37,640
The engagement is set.
How can you not marry me?

139
00:08:39,247 --> 00:08:39,727
What?

140
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:40,887
Your second uncle

141
00:08:40,887 --> 00:08:43,968
and Mao are discussing your engagement.

142
00:08:45,007 --> 00:08:45,808
Engagement?

143
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:47,367
My parents agreed.

144
00:08:48,007 --> 00:08:49,767
Second Master wants my parents

145
00:08:49,767 --> 00:08:50,847
to come here to propose.

146
00:08:54,607 --> 00:08:56,247
Are you happy?

147
00:08:56,487 --> 00:08:56,847
I...

148
00:08:58,808 --> 00:09:00,808
What are you running away, Yixiu?

149
00:09:02,808 --> 00:09:03,968
What's wrong

150
00:09:04,048 --> 00:09:05,487
with these two children?

151
00:09:05,568 --> 00:09:06,847
She's shy.

152
00:09:06,968 --> 00:09:08,328
How can you talk about her marriage

153
00:09:08,367 --> 00:09:09,887
in front of her?

154
00:09:11,367 --> 00:09:12,168
Yixiu.

155
00:09:13,408 --> 00:09:14,208
Yixiu.

156
00:09:16,607 --> 00:09:17,367
Yixiu.

157
00:09:18,647 --> 00:09:19,847
Running away is no use.

158
00:09:19,928 --> 00:09:22,048
You're my bride now.

159
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:24,647
Why... Why didn't you

160
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,088
write to me first?

161
00:09:26,088 --> 00:09:27,527
It was so embarrassing.

162
00:09:27,887 --> 00:09:29,048
Did you truly mean

163
00:09:29,048 --> 00:09:30,247
what you said just now?

164
00:09:31,367 --> 00:09:32,367
Stop asking me.

165
00:09:33,048 --> 00:09:35,007
You said if my parents
still wouldn't agree

166
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:35,887
to our marriage,

167
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,360
you would not get married in this life.

168
00:09:38,168 --> 00:09:39,487
Stop it.

169
00:09:41,247 --> 00:09:42,727
I, Lin Mao, hereby make an oath.

170
00:09:43,088 --> 00:09:44,127
In this lifetime,

171
00:09:44,168 --> 00:09:46,048
I will love only Yixiu.

172
00:09:46,048 --> 00:09:47,048
We will be together,

173
00:09:47,048 --> 00:09:48,048
alive or dead.

174
00:09:48,048 --> 00:09:49,887
Enough. Don't be so loud.

175
00:09:49,887 --> 00:09:51,007
There are many people here.

176
00:09:56,088 --> 00:09:56,767
But

177
00:09:56,767 --> 00:09:59,487
how did you convince your parents?

178
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:01,568
Actually,

179
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:03,887
Old Madam Luo did us a great favor.

180
00:10:04,887 --> 00:10:06,688
Grandma helped us?

181
00:10:09,247 --> 00:10:10,487
Bring this letter

182
00:10:11,048 --> 00:10:12,727
to your parents.

183
00:10:15,568 --> 00:10:17,767
Old Madam Luo, what is this?

184
00:10:17,928 --> 00:10:20,727
Previously, I disapproved
of this marriage

185
00:10:21,448 --> 00:10:23,847
because of your family's attitude.

186
00:10:24,007 --> 00:10:24,968
Other than that,

187
00:10:25,448 --> 00:10:26,847
I'm not sure

188
00:10:27,048 --> 00:10:29,208
if you truly love

189
00:10:29,208 --> 00:10:30,767
Yixiu.

190
00:10:32,727 --> 00:10:34,647
Seeing how sincerely

191
00:10:35,408 --> 00:10:37,727
you want to marry Yixiu

192
00:10:38,527 --> 00:10:40,048
has put my mind at ease.

193
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,720
Please rest assured, Old Madam Luo.

194
00:10:41,727 --> 00:10:43,208
My sincerity is more genuine than gold.

195
00:10:43,288 --> 00:10:44,088
Well.

196
00:10:44,568 --> 00:10:47,727
After all, Yixiu is my granddaughter.

197
00:10:47,727 --> 00:10:49,767
If she really likes

198
00:10:49,767 --> 00:10:51,247
you,

199
00:10:51,328 --> 00:10:53,647
I won't mind traveling to Lin'an again

200
00:10:53,647 --> 00:10:55,607
with my aged body.

201
00:10:56,259 --> 00:10:57,058
I've explained this

202
00:10:57,568 --> 00:10:58,367
to your parents

203
00:10:58,367 --> 00:11:00,168
in the letter.

204
00:11:04,048 --> 00:11:05,048
Thank you, Old Madam Luo.

205
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,408
Get up now.

206
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:10,727
You should get going now.

207
00:11:11,767 --> 00:11:12,808
I'll return soon.

208
00:11:14,768 --> 00:11:16,064
There was another person

209
00:11:16,128 --> 00:11:17,680
who helped us this time.

210
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,688
Who?

211
00:11:19,008 --> 00:11:21,040
The Lin Family has been in business
for many years.

212
00:11:21,048 --> 00:11:22,127
It's normal that they weigh

213
00:11:22,168 --> 00:11:23,607
the pros and cons of this matter.

214
00:11:23,607 --> 00:11:24,328
However,

215
00:11:24,527 --> 00:11:26,688
this matter isn't hopeless at all.

216
00:11:27,048 --> 00:11:28,007
Pray to tell.

217
00:11:29,568 --> 00:11:30,607
Merchants,

218
00:11:31,168 --> 00:11:32,767
aside from profits,

219
00:11:32,968 --> 00:11:34,208
also value a good reputation.

220
00:11:35,887 --> 00:11:36,887
What does that mean?

221
00:11:37,247 --> 00:11:38,527
The former comes from business,

222
00:11:38,968 --> 00:11:40,568
but the latter is hard to earn.

223
00:11:40,568 --> 00:11:41,288
Fortunately,

224
00:11:42,007 --> 00:11:43,088
the current Luo's Residence,

225
00:11:43,088 --> 00:11:45,887
or I should say Yixiu's cousin,

226
00:11:46,016 --> 00:11:47,160
can provide them with that.

227
00:11:48,568 --> 00:11:49,527
You are saying

228
00:11:49,607 --> 00:11:51,007
that Third Brother also helped us?

229
00:11:51,007 --> 00:11:52,208
He helped me pave the way

230
00:11:52,247 --> 00:11:53,887
for the Lin Family's business.

231
00:11:54,408 --> 00:11:55,568
But when I returned here,

232
00:11:55,568 --> 00:11:57,568
I heard a lot of rumors about him.

233
00:11:57,568 --> 00:11:58,688
What actually has happened?

234
00:11:59,607 --> 00:12:01,208
To be honest, I'm not quite sure.

235
00:12:01,568 --> 00:12:03,048
I only know

236
00:12:03,048 --> 00:12:04,767
that Duke Ying came
and made a scene here,

237
00:12:04,887 --> 00:12:06,007
and then Grandma punished

238
00:12:06,007 --> 00:12:07,247
Third Brother all of a sudden.

239
00:12:07,568 --> 00:12:09,048
Besides, he's been very busy lately.

240
00:12:09,048 --> 00:12:10,088
He doesn't come back often.

241
00:12:10,088 --> 00:12:11,847
I haven't seen him for quite a while.

242
00:12:12,367 --> 00:12:13,168
Well,

243
00:12:13,527 --> 00:12:15,088
I really miss the old days

244
00:12:15,607 --> 00:12:17,767
when you, me, Shenyuan,

245
00:12:17,808 --> 00:12:18,727
and Yining

246
00:12:18,727 --> 00:12:20,688
were having carefree times together.

247
00:12:22,088 --> 00:12:22,887
But now,

248
00:12:23,847 --> 00:12:25,367
everything has changed.

249
00:12:30,048 --> 00:12:32,208
You generously helped me earlier today.

250
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:33,647
Longhua Trading House delivered

251
00:12:33,647 --> 00:12:34,679
ten chests of valuables.

252
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,048
It's a small token of appreciation.

253
00:12:36,064 --> 00:12:37,720
I hope you will accept them,
Chancellor Wang.

254
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:39,168
Oh, well.

255
00:12:39,288 --> 00:12:40,208
Why did you

256
00:12:41,247 --> 00:12:42,847
personally send them here,

257
00:12:43,367 --> 00:12:45,007
Minister Luo?

258
00:12:45,367 --> 00:12:47,688
I'm debating

259
00:12:47,688 --> 00:12:49,168
whether I should accept them or not.

260
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:51,088
It's a hard decision.

261
00:12:52,007 --> 00:12:53,247
Your help

262
00:12:53,367 --> 00:12:55,007
is a huge favor

263
00:12:55,007 --> 00:12:56,887
for me and Longquan Trading House.

264
00:12:57,168 --> 00:12:59,168
This is only a small gift.

265
00:12:59,367 --> 00:13:02,887
I hope you won't turn them down.

266
00:13:02,887 --> 00:13:03,688
Very well.

267
00:13:04,048 --> 00:13:05,328
If so,

268
00:13:05,887 --> 00:13:07,487
I shall accept them.

269
00:13:08,088 --> 00:13:08,887
Come.

270
00:13:17,487 --> 00:13:18,247
Gao Da.

271
00:13:20,528 --> 00:13:21,232
Chancellor Wang.

272
00:13:21,607 --> 00:13:23,688
Send him to the guest room.

273
00:13:24,247 --> 00:13:24,808
Yes.

274
00:13:36,887 --> 00:13:39,048
I can do it myself.

275
00:13:57,328 --> 00:13:59,808
Keep a close watch.
Report to me once anything happens.

276
00:14:00,487 --> 00:14:01,247
Yes.

277
00:14:21,808 --> 00:14:23,048
Why is there a letter

278
00:14:23,048 --> 00:14:24,367
this late at night?

279
00:14:24,367 --> 00:14:25,767
Perhaps the North is getting anxious.

280
00:14:35,536 --> 00:14:36,592
Chancellor Wang, here.

281
00:14:41,216 --> 00:14:42,560
(It's near. Keep your promise.)
(How many men will Wei lead?)

282
00:14:42,576 --> 00:14:42,912
This...

283
00:14:43,647 --> 00:14:45,288
They're pressing too hard.

284
00:14:46,487 --> 00:14:48,208
Is the situation of military deployment

285
00:14:48,247 --> 00:14:49,247
in every area sorted out?

286
00:14:49,328 --> 00:14:49,887
It's here.

287
00:14:56,367 --> 00:14:57,208
All right.

288
00:14:57,968 --> 00:14:59,168
Send this to them.

289
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:00,007
Yes.

290
00:15:54,048 --> 00:15:55,408
Is there any unusual movement?

291
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:57,408
Everything's normal, Chancellor Wang.

292
00:16:51,808 --> 00:16:53,887
Young Master, you told us

293
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:56,048
to closely monitor everyone
in the Wang's Residence.

294
00:16:56,367 --> 00:16:57,767
Our men noticed someone

295
00:16:57,936 --> 00:16:59,200
had left the residence hurriedly

296
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:00,887
last night.

297
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:02,568
I've put a tail on him.

298
00:17:02,727 --> 00:17:05,087
This person probably
went to deliver a letter.

299
00:17:05,368 --> 00:17:06,208
What letter?

300
00:17:07,047 --> 00:17:08,128
If I'm not wrong,

301
00:17:08,168 --> 00:17:09,848
it should be a letter for the North.

302
00:17:10,247 --> 00:17:11,639
The pattern of this seal

303
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,184
does resemble the ones
used in the North.

304
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:14,567
Did Wang Yuan

305
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:16,247
actually conspire with the enemy

306
00:17:16,968 --> 00:17:18,848
other than smuggling?

307
00:17:18,848 --> 00:17:20,648
If so, Duke Ying

308
00:17:20,648 --> 00:17:21,727
will be in danger over there.

309
00:17:22,287 --> 00:17:23,567
The tea-horse trades at the border

310
00:17:23,567 --> 00:17:24,968
have always been under his charge.

311
00:17:25,287 --> 00:17:26,688
Perhaps those in the North

312
00:17:26,807 --> 00:17:28,968
approached him for collusion
after knowing

313
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:30,896
that he traded tea leaves
for low-quality horses.

314
00:17:30,976 --> 00:17:32,416
Quickly send this message to the North

315
00:17:32,888 --> 00:17:35,047
to Duke Ying.

316
00:17:36,128 --> 00:17:36,928
Yes.

317
00:17:37,007 --> 00:17:37,807
Also,

318
00:17:37,888 --> 00:17:39,856
keep close to the person
delivering the letter.

319
00:17:39,872 --> 00:17:41,280
Perhaps we can trace

320
00:17:41,287 --> 00:17:42,527
their hideout.

321
00:17:42,807 --> 00:17:43,608
Understood.

322
00:17:45,567 --> 00:17:46,327
Shopkeeper Zheng.

323
00:17:46,327 --> 00:17:47,087
Yes.

324
00:17:47,087 --> 00:17:47,968
In three days,

325
00:17:48,047 --> 00:17:50,047
Wang Yuan will use our ships.

326
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:52,128
All the crew members
are his trusted aides.

327
00:17:52,168 --> 00:17:53,727
He appointed you to accompany them.

328
00:17:54,247 --> 00:17:56,368
Do protect yourself and our men well.

329
00:17:56,767 --> 00:17:58,087
Don't expose yourselves.

330
00:17:58,968 --> 00:17:59,968
Be rest assured, sir.

331
00:18:00,007 --> 00:18:01,487
I'll be cautious.

332
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,056
I'll look forward to your good news.

333
00:18:03,648 --> 00:18:04,487
All right.

334
00:18:04,609 --> 00:18:06,569
(Duke Ying's Residence)

335
00:18:23,247 --> 00:18:25,087
Is this really from the North?

336
00:18:25,408 --> 00:18:26,527
Old Madam Wei,

337
00:18:26,567 --> 00:18:28,168
this is an urgent letter.

338
00:18:28,287 --> 00:18:29,208
His Lordship...

339
00:18:30,247 --> 00:18:31,047
Grandma,

340
00:18:32,807 --> 00:18:33,888
what has happened to Father?

341
00:18:34,047 --> 00:18:34,968
While your father

342
00:18:35,368 --> 00:18:37,368
was fighting the enemy in the desert,

343
00:18:37,968 --> 00:18:40,087
20,000 armies fell into the trap

344
00:18:40,648 --> 00:18:41,888
and were almost dead.

345
00:18:43,047 --> 00:18:45,408
Your father disappeared.

346
00:18:47,047 --> 00:18:48,208
Disappeared?

347
00:18:56,047 --> 00:18:57,567
I want to see him,

348
00:18:59,368 --> 00:19:00,608
no matter if he's alive or dead.

349
00:19:01,727 --> 00:19:03,487
If there's no news,

350
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:04,888
I'll assume

351
00:19:05,527 --> 00:19:07,487
he's still alive.

352
00:19:07,487 --> 00:19:09,327
Grandma, before Father left,

353
00:19:09,368 --> 00:19:11,368
he promised he'd return safe and sound.

354
00:19:11,968 --> 00:19:13,208
He won't break his promise.

355
00:19:13,247 --> 00:19:14,047
Right.

356
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,648
(Nice. Delicious.)

357
00:19:44,807 --> 00:19:46,567
(You haven't tried it yet, Father.)

358
00:19:46,672 --> 00:19:48,528
I can tell it's delicious
just by looking at it.

359
00:19:49,608 --> 00:19:50,767
Please try it, Father.

360
00:20:04,247 --> 00:20:05,047
Ning,

361
00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:06,928
I'll prepare

362
00:20:06,928 --> 00:20:08,168
another set of gifts for you.

363
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:09,527
There's no need, Duke Ying.

364
00:20:09,968 --> 00:20:11,287
I've prepared everything.

365
00:20:11,527 --> 00:20:12,527
You prepare yours,

366
00:20:12,527 --> 00:20:13,848
and I'll prepare mine.

367
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:15,047
It's different.

368
00:20:15,848 --> 00:20:16,648
Wait for me.

369
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:21,727
(Your grandma is getting old in years,)

370
00:20:21,767 --> 00:20:22,888
(and Ting is still young.)

371
00:20:23,007 --> 00:20:23,968
While I'm away

372
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:25,648
during this expedition,

373
00:20:25,968 --> 00:20:26,767
I'm entrusting

374
00:20:27,408 --> 00:20:28,807
(this home to you.)

375
00:20:35,047 --> 00:20:36,168
Yining.

376
00:20:43,527 --> 00:20:44,848
Why are you here?

377
00:20:48,487 --> 00:20:49,247
Yining,

378
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:52,848
is Father not coming back?

379
00:20:53,087 --> 00:20:54,368
Where did you get that?

380
00:20:54,968 --> 00:20:57,208
Many maids and servants
are talking about it.

381
00:20:57,487 --> 00:20:58,567
They say Father

382
00:21:00,727 --> 00:21:01,648
died in the war.

383
00:21:01,767 --> 00:21:02,567
That's not true.

384
00:21:04,368 --> 00:21:06,928
Father just encountered some problems
in the war.

385
00:21:06,968 --> 00:21:08,527
He'll return safely.

386
00:21:08,848 --> 00:21:09,928
Do you still remember

387
00:21:09,968 --> 00:21:11,527
when Father talked to us

388
00:21:11,567 --> 00:21:12,888
in this room?

389
00:21:13,047 --> 00:21:14,247
He promised us

390
00:21:14,368 --> 00:21:15,888
he would be back safe and sound.

391
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,287
Ting, remember this.

392
00:21:20,368 --> 00:21:21,648
You are the only son

393
00:21:21,848 --> 00:21:22,999
of Duke Ying's Residence.

394
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,976
At a time like this, you must have
your own judgment.

395
00:21:25,008 --> 00:21:26,120
Don't be swayed by rumors.

396
00:21:26,168 --> 00:21:28,208
You have to believe
that Father will come back.

397
00:21:32,727 --> 00:21:35,007
Well, stop crying. Dry those tears.

398
00:21:35,087 --> 00:21:35,968
In the meantime,

399
00:21:36,168 --> 00:21:37,888
we must protect this house

400
00:21:38,112 --> 00:21:39,400
and wait for Father to come back.

401
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:42,968
Understood.

402
00:21:46,047 --> 00:21:47,688
Letter from the North, Chancellor Wang.

403
00:21:52,688 --> 00:21:54,920
(Duke Ying, Wei Ling,
encountered an ambush in the desert.)

404
00:21:55,088 --> 00:21:57,664
(His body disappeared after a sandstorm.
We're not sure if he died.)

405
00:21:58,688 --> 00:22:00,208
His body can't be found?

406
00:22:00,288 --> 00:22:02,080
Duke Ying encountered an ambush
in the desert

407
00:22:02,208 --> 00:22:03,608
and then a sandstorm.

408
00:22:03,608 --> 00:22:05,287
It's normal
that his body has disappeared.

409
00:22:06,888 --> 00:22:07,727
Does Wei Ling

410
00:22:09,767 --> 00:22:11,247
really die?

411
00:22:11,767 --> 00:22:13,208
The chief leader of the North

412
00:22:13,287 --> 00:22:15,368
was defeated by Wei Ling years ago,

413
00:22:15,567 --> 00:22:16,888
and he has held a grudge.

414
00:22:17,007 --> 00:22:18,368
This time, he'd be determined

415
00:22:18,487 --> 00:22:19,968
to ambush him with a large troop.

416
00:22:20,608 --> 00:22:22,047
How's the situation at the sea?

417
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:23,408
Longquan Trading House

418
00:22:23,767 --> 00:22:25,047
is meticulous.

419
00:22:25,047 --> 00:22:26,208
They're already back.

420
00:22:26,368 --> 00:22:28,368
Go and welcome them

421
00:22:28,968 --> 00:22:31,047
and temporarily hold them up.

422
00:22:31,567 --> 00:22:32,327
Yes.

423
00:22:36,727 --> 00:22:38,047
Everything goes

424
00:22:38,047 --> 00:22:39,727
unusually smoothly, though.

425
00:22:41,168 --> 00:22:41,848
Move.

426
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:42,888
Move.

427
00:22:47,047 --> 00:22:47,727
Move aside!

428
00:22:50,968 --> 00:22:51,767
Mei.

429
00:22:53,968 --> 00:22:55,679
Let's leave.
I'll take you away from here.

430
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,024
What's the urgent matter, Marquis Lu?

431
00:22:57,056 --> 00:22:58,409
My men are waiting at the back door.

432
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:00,180
Hurry and call for Wei Ting
and Old Madam Wei.

433
00:23:00,208 --> 00:23:01,128
I'll escort you out.

434
00:23:01,128 --> 00:23:02,408
Grandma won't leave,

435
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,296
and neither will I.

436
00:23:03,328 --> 00:23:06,000
Wang Yuan and his faction reported
to His Majesty in the morning session

437
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,480
that Duke Ying and his army
of 20,000 soldiers had disappeared

438
00:23:08,624 --> 00:23:10,240
and were likely
to surrender to the enemy.

439
00:23:10,608 --> 00:23:11,567
That's impossible!

440
00:23:11,727 --> 00:23:13,688
My father would never surrender.

441
00:23:14,208 --> 00:23:15,128
Mei, think about this.

442
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:18,040
His Majesty ordered Wang Yuan
to investigate this matter.

443
00:23:18,208 --> 00:23:20,608
But why didn't he immediately
review the military news

444
00:23:20,727 --> 00:23:21,688
to assess the situation?

445
00:23:21,936 --> 00:23:24,120
Instead, he's leading a troop
to search the Wei's Residence.

446
00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:26,368
Are you saying

447
00:23:26,512 --> 00:23:27,776
that he's trying to slander us?

448
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:30,567
If Duke Ying is proven

449
00:23:30,567 --> 00:23:31,888
guilty of treason,

450
00:23:31,936 --> 00:23:33,152
even if he survives and returns,

451
00:23:33,168 --> 00:23:34,520
he couldn't enter the capital anymore

452
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,192
or even seek an audience
with His Majesty.

453
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:36,784
Mei,

454
00:23:38,224 --> 00:23:40,256
the crime of treason
can implicate the entire clan.

455
00:23:40,272 --> 00:23:41,232
I'll take you away.

456
00:23:41,248 --> 00:23:43,056
Thank you for informing me, Marquis Lu.

457
00:23:43,527 --> 00:23:45,039
You should leave now.

458
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:46,288
I don't want to get you involved.

459
00:23:46,408 --> 00:23:47,247
I said

460
00:23:48,007 --> 00:23:49,247
I would keep you safe.

461
00:23:49,888 --> 00:23:51,567
I'm the eldest daughter of Duke Ying,

462
00:23:51,568 --> 00:23:53,264
and I enjoy the honor
of Duke Ying's Residence

463
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,432
and my father's love.

464
00:23:55,327 --> 00:23:57,368
Today, I will guard this gate,

465
00:23:57,368 --> 00:23:59,767
even if it costs me my life.

466
00:24:03,536 --> 00:24:04,720
I must enter the palace.

467
00:24:05,408 --> 00:24:07,727
Grandma, I'll go with you.

468
00:24:08,888 --> 00:24:09,727
No.

469
00:24:10,688 --> 00:24:13,208
You stay here and protect
our home with your sister.

470
00:24:13,287 --> 00:24:14,287
I'll go to the palace

471
00:24:14,767 --> 00:24:16,087
to seek an audience.

472
00:24:16,968 --> 00:24:18,007
Take care of Grandma.

473
00:24:27,773 --> 00:24:29,429
(Liuhe Tavern)

474
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,796
(Life)

475
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:47,515
(Death)

476
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,382
(Death, Life)

477
00:24:57,567 --> 00:24:58,368
Young Master.

478
00:24:59,072 --> 00:25:00,880
How's the situation
at Duke Ying's Residence?

479
00:25:01,327 --> 00:25:02,928
Wang Yuan and his men
already went there.

480
00:25:03,007 --> 00:25:04,247
Old Madam Wei went to the palace.

481
00:25:04,727 --> 00:25:06,648
Only Young Lady Yining stays
to confront them.

482
00:25:07,007 --> 00:25:08,368
I wonder if she's able to handle it.

483
00:25:17,208 --> 00:25:17,807
Chancellor Wang.

484
00:25:20,665 --> 00:25:22,506
You are in a good mood.

485
00:25:23,567 --> 00:25:24,968
You came here for tea

486
00:25:25,208 --> 00:25:27,168
early in the morning.

487
00:25:27,648 --> 00:25:29,567
Today's my off day,
so I have nothing much to do.

488
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:31,767
What brings you here, Chancellor Wang?

489
00:25:32,208 --> 00:25:33,928
I came here for you.

490
00:25:34,608 --> 00:25:36,688
Something serious happened
in the capital.

491
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,880
How could Vice Minister
of Imperial Court of Judicial

492
00:25:39,368 --> 00:25:41,208
have free time here?

493
00:25:41,727 --> 00:25:42,608
What has happened?

494
00:25:43,087 --> 00:25:44,727
It's Duke Ying.

495
00:25:45,727 --> 00:25:47,527
Isn't he missing?

496
00:25:50,007 --> 00:25:51,368
Shenyuan, you hold

497
00:25:51,727 --> 00:25:53,648
an important post
in Imperial Court of Judicial.

498
00:25:54,247 --> 00:25:56,408
How could you say that?

499
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:59,296
Are you not going
to investigate the case

500
00:25:59,312 --> 00:26:01,120
when the criminal commits suicide
out of guilt?

501
00:26:01,287 --> 00:26:02,487
You have

502
00:26:02,648 --> 00:26:04,848
to uncover the truth.

503
00:26:05,928 --> 00:26:07,527
Thank you for enlightening me.

504
00:26:07,888 --> 00:26:08,928
All right.

505
00:26:09,047 --> 00:26:11,208
Let's go now.

506
00:26:20,408 --> 00:26:21,247
Open the door.

507
00:26:23,888 --> 00:26:24,767
Open the door!

508
00:26:24,848 --> 00:26:25,527
Yes.

509
00:26:41,007 --> 00:26:41,968
Your Highness,

510
00:26:43,128 --> 00:26:46,727
I'm ordered to search
Duke Ying's residence.

511
00:26:47,327 --> 00:26:48,848
Since this is an order,

512
00:26:48,968 --> 00:26:50,368
we shall cooperate with you.

513
00:26:50,727 --> 00:26:53,567
How understanding of you, Your Highness.

514
00:26:54,128 --> 00:26:54,928
Hold on.

515
00:26:57,087 --> 00:26:59,608
There should be a reason
for this search.

516
00:27:01,487 --> 00:27:04,208
Duke Ying's greed for success

517
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:06,208
has caused the sacrifice
of the entire army.

518
00:27:06,608 --> 00:27:09,047
His Majesty worries there might be
a reason behind his actions,

519
00:27:09,047 --> 00:27:12,487
so Chancellor Wang is sent
to investigate this matter.

520
00:27:12,527 --> 00:27:13,688
If that's the case,

521
00:27:13,968 --> 00:27:15,368
you don't have an imperial decree.

522
00:27:20,928 --> 00:27:22,047
How can we investigate

523
00:27:22,567 --> 00:27:23,767
if we don't search the residence?

524
00:27:27,247 --> 00:27:28,208
Everyone in this residence

525
00:27:28,567 --> 00:27:30,368
is not allowed to leave
without permission.

526
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:32,512
None of the objects
shall be transferred.

527
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:33,399
Search the residence!

528
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,600
I'm the county princess
personally appointed by His Majesty.

529
00:27:35,727 --> 00:27:37,208
Lay your fingers on me if you dare.

530
00:27:37,208 --> 00:27:38,848
You may be a princess,

531
00:27:39,087 --> 00:27:40,688
but if you hinder the Imperial Guards,

532
00:27:40,688 --> 00:27:42,608
we're entitled

533
00:27:42,648 --> 00:27:43,648
to arrest you immediately.

534
00:27:43,648 --> 00:27:44,247
Don't you dare!

535
00:27:45,888 --> 00:27:46,807
Take her down.

536
00:27:47,087 --> 00:27:47,888
Stop!

537
00:27:51,368 --> 00:27:52,368
Deputy Commander Liang,

538
00:27:52,368 --> 00:27:53,727
you're imposing.

539
00:28:00,408 --> 00:28:00,928
Don't worry.

540
00:28:00,928 --> 00:28:01,928
Marquis Lu,

541
00:28:01,928 --> 00:28:04,648
I'm following Chancellor Wang's order.

542
00:28:04,648 --> 00:28:06,287
Chancellor Wang knows His Majesty holds

543
00:28:06,287 --> 00:28:08,047
those late meritorious generals
in high regard.

544
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,112
How could he possibly allow you
to act so recklessly?

545
00:28:10,144 --> 00:28:12,320
If you tarnish His Majesty's reputation,

546
00:28:12,727 --> 00:28:14,007
can you afford the consequences?

547
00:28:14,047 --> 00:28:15,567
Don't worry, Marquis Lu.

548
00:28:15,688 --> 00:28:17,888
You're on furlough,

549
00:28:17,888 --> 00:28:19,287
so why don't you relax?

550
00:28:19,567 --> 00:28:20,888
You may leave the affairs

551
00:28:21,247 --> 00:28:23,567
to me.

552
00:28:25,727 --> 00:28:27,168
Even so,

553
00:28:28,087 --> 00:28:30,128
I'm still the commander
of the Imperial Guards.

554
00:28:30,408 --> 00:28:32,368
If anything goes wrong
about the Imperial Guards,

555
00:28:32,368 --> 00:28:34,368
I can't stay out of it.

556
00:28:34,567 --> 00:28:35,848
I'll enter the palace now

557
00:28:36,527 --> 00:28:38,047
and seek His Majesty's opinion.

558
00:28:38,368 --> 00:28:39,168
Please leave.

559
00:29:05,247 --> 00:29:06,047
Chancellor Wang.

560
00:29:08,848 --> 00:29:09,968
His Majesty just spoke of you

561
00:29:10,007 --> 00:29:11,727
to me,

562
00:29:11,888 --> 00:29:13,608
and now you want to enter the palace.

563
00:29:13,888 --> 00:29:15,527
Both you and His Majesty

564
00:29:15,888 --> 00:29:17,567
share the same thought.

565
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,040
Duke Ying lost in the war
and has defected to the enemy.

566
00:29:21,208 --> 00:29:23,727
His Majesty orders me

567
00:29:23,727 --> 00:29:24,727
to investigate this matter.

568
00:29:24,727 --> 00:29:25,727
This is nonsense.

569
00:29:26,007 --> 00:29:27,567
My father will never defect
to the enemy.

570
00:29:29,087 --> 00:29:30,888
Young Lady Mingzhu, are you suggesting

571
00:29:30,888 --> 00:29:32,727
that His Majesty is talking nonsense?

572
00:29:33,368 --> 00:29:35,727
Since His Majesty
sends you to investigate,

573
00:29:35,744 --> 00:29:37,584
it means the suspicion
hasn't been confirmed yet.

574
00:29:37,688 --> 00:29:38,487
Maybe

575
00:29:38,648 --> 00:29:40,648
someone with an ill intention meddles.

576
00:29:42,896 --> 00:29:44,784
Whether it's someone with ill-intent
meddling

577
00:29:44,888 --> 00:29:46,199
or Duke Ying's rebellion,

578
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,790
we will find out
after the investigation.

579
00:29:48,047 --> 00:29:48,888
Shenyuan,

580
00:29:49,712 --> 00:29:51,440
as Vice Minister
of Imperial Court of Judicial,

581
00:29:51,567 --> 00:29:54,487
you'll handle this.

582
00:29:55,047 --> 00:29:55,848
Yes.

583
00:29:58,047 --> 00:29:58,888
Your Highness,

584
00:29:59,247 --> 00:30:01,487
if Duke Ying doesn't defect
to the enemy,

585
00:30:01,744 --> 00:30:03,160
why are you afraid of the search?

586
00:30:03,208 --> 00:30:04,087
Despicable people

587
00:30:04,527 --> 00:30:05,807
are capable of anything.

588
00:30:06,087 --> 00:30:08,247
Imperial Court of Judicial
has its own protocol to obey.

589
00:30:08,567 --> 00:30:10,368
We won't wrong the innocent.

590
00:30:10,848 --> 00:30:13,087
Please rest assured, Your Highness.

591
00:30:13,368 --> 00:30:14,527
I can't trust

592
00:30:14,567 --> 00:30:15,848
people with a treacherous nature.

593
00:30:16,208 --> 00:30:17,848
My great-grandpa and grandpa once fought

594
00:30:17,848 --> 00:30:19,007
alongside the late Emperor

595
00:30:19,007 --> 00:30:20,727
to expand the empire.

596
00:30:21,047 --> 00:30:23,208
My father has also been sent

597
00:30:23,287 --> 00:30:24,368
to quell several rebellions.

598
00:30:24,408 --> 00:30:26,087
Despite the provision shortage,

599
00:30:26,144 --> 00:30:28,200
he fought with all his might
and never feared death.

600
00:30:28,487 --> 00:30:29,848
He will never betray the country.

601
00:30:32,128 --> 00:30:33,527
A mistake can ruin all contributions.

602
00:30:34,208 --> 00:30:36,527
It's useless to bring this up.

603
00:30:36,727 --> 00:30:39,208
Now, my father's fate is uncertain
in the battleground.

604
00:30:39,968 --> 00:30:41,007
You're here accusing him

605
00:30:41,007 --> 00:30:42,727
of a crime he doesn't do.

606
00:30:42,928 --> 00:30:43,928
This is unfair.

607
00:30:46,408 --> 00:30:47,368
If you still

608
00:30:47,368 --> 00:30:49,208
hinder our work,

609
00:30:49,807 --> 00:30:51,247
I won't spare you.

610
00:30:58,208 --> 00:30:59,047
Move aside!

611
00:30:59,368 --> 00:31:01,648
If you want to enter this gate,

612
00:31:01,648 --> 00:31:03,527
over my dead body.

613
00:31:16,608 --> 00:31:18,567
What are you trying to do, Luo Shenyuan?

614
00:31:18,888 --> 00:31:21,327
Duke Ying is suspected
of committing treason.

615
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,768
Do you still want to interfere,

616
00:31:22,807 --> 00:31:24,368
Marquis Lu?

617
00:31:24,807 --> 00:31:26,087
It's not like you.

618
00:31:26,408 --> 00:31:27,608
Put your sword down.

619
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,087
(Why haven't we received any news)

620
00:31:31,128 --> 00:31:32,567
(after waiting for so long?)

621
00:31:34,047 --> 00:31:34,888
It would seem

622
00:31:36,128 --> 00:31:38,807
that no one is willing to lend
the Wei Family a helping hand.

623
00:31:40,807 --> 00:31:41,567
Forget it.

624
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:43,807
We will resolve

625
00:31:44,408 --> 00:31:46,087
our own problem.

626
00:31:47,688 --> 00:31:48,487
Let's return.

627
00:31:53,047 --> 00:31:54,087
Old Madam Wei,

628
00:31:54,567 --> 00:31:55,368
please hold there!

629
00:32:03,208 --> 00:32:04,007
Your Highness,

630
00:32:04,567 --> 00:32:06,007
since we'd once stayed

631
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,208
in the same residence,

632
00:32:07,487 --> 00:32:08,368
if you step aside now,

633
00:32:08,888 --> 00:32:09,807
I won't hurt you.

634
00:32:10,208 --> 00:32:11,247
Even if I have to die,

635
00:32:12,007 --> 00:32:14,128
I won't let you through the gate.

636
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,528
As expected of the general's daughter.

637
00:32:17,208 --> 00:32:18,888
You carry yourself like a heroine.

638
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:20,767
Very well.

639
00:32:21,208 --> 00:32:22,767
I'll grant your wish, then.

640
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:28,408
Luo Shenyuan!

641
00:32:30,247 --> 00:32:31,047
Luo Shenyuan,

642
00:32:32,247 --> 00:32:33,368
what are you trying to do?

643
00:32:33,807 --> 00:32:34,727
This show

644
00:32:35,208 --> 00:32:36,368
should come to an end.

645
00:32:36,807 --> 00:32:38,767
How dare you take me hostage!

646
00:32:39,047 --> 00:32:40,368
I will not forgive you

647
00:32:41,888 --> 00:32:43,327
for killing my master.

648
00:32:44,047 --> 00:32:45,047
Deputy Commander Liang,

649
00:32:45,047 --> 00:32:46,247
don't mind me.

650
00:32:46,368 --> 00:32:48,128
Kill whoever resists!

651
00:32:48,368 --> 00:32:49,047
Yes.

652
00:32:49,368 --> 00:32:50,727
Here comes the imperial decree!

653
00:33:30,047 --> 00:33:31,368
By the mandate of His Majesty,

654
00:33:39,168 --> 00:33:41,727
"Wang Yuan defies national law,

655
00:33:41,727 --> 00:33:42,999
engaging in smuggling,

656
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,240
conspiring with external enemies,

657
00:33:44,247 --> 00:33:45,408
endangering loyal officials,

658
00:33:45,408 --> 00:33:46,688
and forming personal factions.

659
00:33:46,727 --> 00:33:48,767
The Imperial Guards are to arrest

660
00:33:48,767 --> 00:33:50,208
Wang Yuan and his associates

661
00:33:50,208 --> 00:33:51,287
without error."

662
00:33:52,007 --> 00:33:52,807
Carry it out now.

663
00:33:53,047 --> 00:33:53,888
Yes.

664
00:34:28,288 --> 00:34:30,368
Your smuggling contacts

665
00:34:30,567 --> 00:34:32,087
and trade records

666
00:34:32,328 --> 00:34:33,728
are now in my hands.

667
00:34:34,848 --> 00:34:35,647
Wang Yuan,

668
00:34:37,207 --> 00:34:38,848
surrender now.

669
00:34:40,087 --> 00:34:42,047
You and Yang Ling
have planned this all along.

670
00:34:42,047 --> 00:34:42,888
So you put on a show

671
00:34:42,888 --> 00:34:44,888
for Wang Yuan and Lu Jiaxue

672
00:34:45,127 --> 00:34:47,408
to gain Wang Yuan's trust.

673
00:34:47,728 --> 00:34:48,687
This is the only way

674
00:34:49,207 --> 00:34:51,207
to obtain evidence
of Wang Yuan's evil doing

675
00:34:51,687 --> 00:34:53,079
and clear Senior Yang's name.

676
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:53,968
No, you can't do this.

677
00:34:54,207 --> 00:34:55,567
This is too risky.

678
00:34:56,007 --> 00:34:57,487
Yang Ling has already been imprisoned.

679
00:34:57,487 --> 00:34:58,808
I can't let you...

680
00:34:59,687 --> 00:35:00,487
Master,

681
00:35:00,567 --> 00:35:02,207
I'm not a reckless person.

682
00:35:02,248 --> 00:35:04,408
I hope you will support me.

683
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:07,968
Father wants me to tell you

684
00:35:07,984 --> 00:35:09,984
the operation starts
when the incense is offered.

685
00:35:10,888 --> 00:35:11,848
I assure you

686
00:35:12,328 --> 00:35:14,288
I will not gain Wang Yuan's trust

687
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:15,567
by hurting any of you.

688
00:35:15,567 --> 00:35:16,848
I'm telling you this

689
00:35:17,127 --> 00:35:18,968
so that you'll be more careful later on.

690
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:21,848
Father and I believe

691
00:35:22,647 --> 00:35:23,768
you'll succeed.

692
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,600
As long as you can bring down Wang Yuan

693
00:35:26,487 --> 00:35:27,647
and avenge them,

694
00:35:27,728 --> 00:35:28,808
we're willing to do so.

695
00:35:35,888 --> 00:35:38,888
I've fallen into your hands,
Vice Minister Luo.

696
00:35:40,167 --> 00:35:42,728
I have no complaints.

697
00:35:43,328 --> 00:35:44,647
It's a shame

698
00:35:45,567 --> 00:35:47,207
that my Gold-armored General

699
00:35:47,207 --> 00:35:48,687
will have no one to look after it.

700
00:35:49,408 --> 00:35:50,207
Marquis Lu!

701
00:35:53,567 --> 00:35:55,808
Will you do me this favor?

702
00:35:56,207 --> 00:35:57,728
Wasn't it burned in the fire

703
00:35:58,968 --> 00:36:00,968
after being defeated?

704
00:36:02,968 --> 00:36:05,328
What you see may not
necessarily be true.

705
00:36:06,047 --> 00:36:07,408
What you thought was burned

706
00:36:08,768 --> 00:36:10,848
may still be intact.

707
00:36:33,127 --> 00:36:34,127
Marquis Lu,

708
00:36:34,928 --> 00:36:36,288
what are you waiting for?

709
00:36:36,328 --> 00:36:37,567
Arrest him.

710
00:36:40,607 --> 00:36:41,567
Deputy Commander Liang,

711
00:36:42,248 --> 00:36:43,047
arrest him.

712
00:36:43,527 --> 00:36:44,127
Take him away.

713
00:36:55,487 --> 00:36:56,647
- Father.
- Father.

714
00:36:58,408 --> 00:36:59,527
I knew you'd be safe.

715
00:37:00,167 --> 00:37:02,047
Oh, right. Father,
Grandma went to the palace.

716
00:37:02,167 --> 00:37:03,368
His Majesty has met her.

717
00:37:03,368 --> 00:37:04,527
She should be back soon.

718
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,253
(Imperial Court of Judicial)

719
00:37:26,728 --> 00:37:29,087
You approached me on purpose

720
00:37:29,527 --> 00:37:31,687
since the Eighth Prince's case

721
00:37:32,328 --> 00:37:34,487
just for this day, didn't you?

722
00:37:37,072 --> 00:37:38,960
The tea tax has been declining
year after year,

723
00:37:39,567 --> 00:37:41,047
and warhorses have often had problems.

724
00:37:41,487 --> 00:37:43,007
His Majesty has long been suspicious.

725
00:37:44,248 --> 00:37:46,408
This was the perfect opportunity

726
00:37:46,808 --> 00:37:48,007
to act.

727
00:37:50,368 --> 00:37:51,368
No wonder.

728
00:37:52,567 --> 00:37:54,647
I've always thought

729
00:37:55,207 --> 00:37:56,928
things were going too smoothly.

730
00:37:57,368 --> 00:37:59,728
Turns out it was all part of your plan.

731
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:02,368
I deliberately exposed
my smuggling operation to you,

732
00:38:02,808 --> 00:38:04,968
sought your help,
and offered my services

733
00:38:05,368 --> 00:38:06,368
because I wanted you

734
00:38:06,368 --> 00:38:08,888
to use Longquan Trading House's ships.

735
00:38:09,127 --> 00:38:09,928
So,

736
00:38:10,687 --> 00:38:13,127
Shopkeeper Zheng
followed my trusted aides

737
00:38:13,127 --> 00:38:14,408
and captured them

738
00:38:14,728 --> 00:38:17,728
during the smuggling deal

739
00:38:18,248 --> 00:38:20,567
at sea, right?

740
00:38:21,167 --> 00:38:23,408
Every piece of good news you received

741
00:38:23,928 --> 00:38:25,328
from your trusted aides

742
00:38:25,728 --> 00:38:27,728
was sent while they were
already under control.

743
00:38:27,728 --> 00:38:31,567
Duke Ying and his 20,000 soldiers

744
00:38:32,328 --> 00:38:33,808
went missing after being attacked.

745
00:38:34,647 --> 00:38:36,207
Was it

746
00:38:36,207 --> 00:38:37,328
also a smokescreen?

747
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:42,527
Duke Ying

748
00:38:42,888 --> 00:38:44,968
is a seasoned general.

749
00:38:45,207 --> 00:38:47,248
He knows the weather and terrain
in the North

750
00:38:47,248 --> 00:38:48,288
like the back of his hand.

751
00:38:48,288 --> 00:38:49,328
He purposely chose a day

752
00:38:49,328 --> 00:38:50,607
with sandstorms

753
00:38:50,687 --> 00:38:51,888
to pretend to be ambushed.

754
00:38:51,888 --> 00:38:53,047
In fact,

755
00:38:53,408 --> 00:38:54,888
they wiped out the hideout

756
00:38:54,888 --> 00:38:55,968
of your accomplices.

757
00:38:56,207 --> 00:38:58,248
As of now, the northern enemies

758
00:38:58,607 --> 00:38:59,928
have been captured by Duke Ying

759
00:39:00,687 --> 00:39:02,248
and escorted to the capital.

760
00:39:04,127 --> 00:39:06,007
What a smart plan.

761
00:39:07,567 --> 00:39:09,328
You're indeed shrewd.

762
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,656
The trading of tea
for low-quality horses

763
00:39:12,752 --> 00:39:14,120
and the treason

764
00:39:14,647 --> 00:39:16,207
have all been exposed.

765
00:39:16,647 --> 00:39:17,408
You are

766
00:39:18,687 --> 00:39:20,087
dead.

767
00:39:22,047 --> 00:39:23,848
I'm dead?

768
00:39:25,127 --> 00:39:28,207
As long as I'm still alive,

769
00:39:28,607 --> 00:39:29,808
this won't end

770
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:32,288
so easily.

771
00:39:43,368 --> 00:39:45,487
Do you think I'll give you that chance?

772
00:39:46,248 --> 00:39:47,167
Luo Shenyuan,

773
00:39:49,728 --> 00:39:51,368
I've underestimated you.

774
00:39:51,968 --> 00:39:53,607
I knew you never trusted me

775
00:39:54,248 --> 00:39:55,607
and only wanted to use me.

776
00:39:56,207 --> 00:39:57,607
Your downfall

777
00:39:57,808 --> 00:39:58,687
is because

778
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:00,368
of your greed.

779
00:40:00,368 --> 00:40:01,768
You assume everyone in the world

780
00:40:01,768 --> 00:40:02,808
would do just anything

781
00:40:02,808 --> 00:40:04,728
for money and power

782
00:40:04,728 --> 00:40:06,047
without restraints

783
00:40:06,047 --> 00:40:07,288
like you do.

784
00:40:10,207 --> 00:40:12,288
Look at yourself.

785
00:40:13,368 --> 00:40:14,768
You're no different from your master

786
00:40:14,888 --> 00:40:17,567
and Chen Daoyan.

787
00:40:17,768 --> 00:40:20,888
You all claim to pursue justice

788
00:40:21,368 --> 00:40:23,368
and fight for the country
and its people.

789
00:40:23,368 --> 00:40:24,768
How stupid!

790
00:40:32,487 --> 00:40:33,888
You never understand

791
00:40:36,527 --> 00:40:38,047
what ideals are

792
00:40:38,848 --> 00:40:40,007
and to give everything,

793
00:40:40,928 --> 00:40:42,167
even risking one's life

794
00:40:42,968 --> 00:40:44,328
without regrets.

795
00:40:45,288 --> 00:40:46,248
That's because

796
00:40:47,567 --> 00:40:48,368
you

797
00:40:50,567 --> 00:40:52,207
don't deserve to be called human.

798
00:41:03,872 --> 00:41:04,687
Father,

799
00:41:05,408 --> 00:41:06,368
you're saying

800
00:41:06,647 --> 00:41:08,487
that Third Brother
gave you this clue?

801
00:41:08,687 --> 00:41:08,968
Yes.

802
00:41:09,087 --> 00:41:09,888
So

803
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:11,728
you eliminated their hideout.

804
00:41:11,928 --> 00:41:12,728
Exactly.

805
00:41:13,047 --> 00:41:15,199
As of now, not only

806
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,512
has their hideout been eliminated,

807
00:41:16,608 --> 00:41:19,400
but I've also handed over the letters

808
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,200
between Wang Yuan and them
to His Majesty.

809
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:23,728
Did you both plan all of this

810
00:41:24,047 --> 00:41:26,167
before the war expedition?

811
00:41:35,214 --> 00:41:36,527
I truly regret

812
00:41:37,007 --> 00:41:38,328
accidentally hurting Yining.

813
00:41:39,007 --> 00:41:41,207
If you're still mad, you can stab me.

814
00:41:41,738 --> 00:41:42,658
I won't dodge.

815
00:41:44,408 --> 00:41:45,848
If a stab

816
00:41:45,968 --> 00:41:48,047
would ease Yining's pain,

817
00:41:49,087 --> 00:41:50,768
I would.

818
00:41:50,968 --> 00:41:51,768
Once this is over,

819
00:41:52,487 --> 00:41:54,167
I'll sincerely apologize to Yining.

820
00:41:54,368 --> 00:41:55,167
All right.

821
00:41:55,928 --> 00:41:57,047
As things stand,

822
00:41:57,288 --> 00:41:58,728
it's useless to talk about it.

823
00:42:00,567 --> 00:42:02,888
This is the evidence you found?

824
00:42:03,087 --> 00:42:03,888
Yes.

825
00:42:04,288 --> 00:42:06,527
This is Wang Yuan's ledger

826
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:07,968
of his sea smuggling,

827
00:42:08,207 --> 00:42:10,647
in which he embezzled
the remaining tea leaves from the trade

828
00:42:10,848 --> 00:42:12,567
in exchange for low-quality horses.

829
00:42:12,728 --> 00:42:14,567
Why didn't you present this earlier?

830
00:42:15,047 --> 00:42:17,047
Half of the ledger
was in Li Yinglong's hands,

831
00:42:17,328 --> 00:42:18,888
and the other half was
with Song Yingshan.

832
00:42:19,184 --> 00:42:21,088
I've only just managed
to compile everything.

833
00:42:21,848 --> 00:42:23,007
These shameless scoundrels!

834
00:42:23,728 --> 00:42:25,888
These shameless scoundrels
are responsible

835
00:42:26,368 --> 00:42:28,368
for the deaths of my soldiers.

836
00:42:28,647 --> 00:42:31,047
This man must be eliminated
to prevent further harm.

837
00:42:32,687 --> 00:42:34,567
I hope you will assist me.

838
00:42:36,808 --> 00:42:37,607
What should I do?

839
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:39,248
I suspect that Wang Yuan

840
00:42:39,928 --> 00:42:41,047
not only smuggled

841
00:42:41,504 --> 00:42:42,960
but also colluded with the enemy.

842
00:42:48,928 --> 00:42:51,368
You want me to capture them

843
00:42:51,888 --> 00:42:54,087
on this coming expedition?

844
00:42:54,207 --> 00:42:55,007
Yes.

845
00:42:59,248 --> 00:43:00,288
Do you realize

846
00:43:00,888 --> 00:43:03,728
how dangerous this plan is?

847
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:05,647
If it fails,

848
00:43:06,167 --> 00:43:08,047
the consequences will be unimaginable.

849
00:43:08,567 --> 00:43:10,047
I'm willing to take this risk

850
00:43:10,567 --> 00:43:12,047
because I've planned everything well.

851
00:43:12,328 --> 00:43:13,127
Very well.

852
00:43:13,848 --> 00:43:14,848
If so, I'll help you.

853
00:43:15,808 --> 00:43:17,007
But remember,

854
00:43:17,408 --> 00:43:18,567
before this succeeds,

855
00:43:19,047 --> 00:43:21,768
let's not meet again,

856
00:43:23,207 --> 00:43:24,328
including Yining.

857
00:43:27,007 --> 00:43:27,808
Understood.

858
00:43:28,808 --> 00:43:30,567
This plan is too dangerous.

859
00:43:30,728 --> 00:43:31,848
I didn't want to worry you.

860
00:43:31,848 --> 00:43:33,288
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

861
00:43:35,567 --> 00:43:36,567
