=The Rise of Ning=

00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,320
(Adapted from Wen Tan's novel "Chancellor
Training Handbook" from Jinjiang Literature)

3
00:01:36,494 --> 00:01:38,657
=Episode 1=

4
00:01:40,072 --> 00:01:41,837
(The Capital)

5
00:01:46,955 --> 00:01:47,554
Young Lady,

6
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:48,464
it has been a long while

7
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:49,520
since we returned last time.

8
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:50,550
You've been in the side yard

9
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,552
and refused to come back.

10
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,368
Why did you suddenly

11
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:53,270
listen to Old Madam Luo

12
00:01:53,395 --> 00:01:54,074
and come back?

13
00:01:54,784 --> 00:01:56,752
(Luo Yining)
It's Grandma's 60th birthday banquet.

14
00:01:56,795 --> 00:01:58,115
I certainly have to come back.

15
00:01:59,395 --> 00:02:02,035
Do you plan to stay
in Luo's Residence afterward?

16
00:02:02,955 --> 00:02:04,315
Of course not.

17
00:02:04,395 --> 00:02:06,035
After visiting Grandma and Mother,

18
00:02:06,048 --> 00:02:07,110
we will go back right away.

19
00:02:07,634 --> 00:02:08,475
Young Lady, you're

20
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,096
the legitimate daughter
of the Luo Family.

21
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,280
You can't always...

22
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,944
Staying in Luo's Residence is not good.

23
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,664
The people have complicated
relationships and live in disharmony.

24
00:02:15,955 --> 00:02:17,675
It's better to stay in the side yard.

25
00:02:17,915 --> 00:02:18,994
Simple and carefree.

26
00:02:19,395 --> 00:02:21,274
If the Luo's Residence
were really that good,

27
00:02:21,515 --> 00:02:22,475
(Grandma wouldn't have)

28
00:02:22,554 --> 00:02:23,554
(sent me to the side yard.)

29
00:02:23,635 --> 00:02:25,314
You climb so high. It's dangerous.

30
00:02:25,344 --> 00:02:26,672
(Young Luo Yining)
So high, Seventh Lady.

31
00:02:26,704 --> 00:02:27,430
We can't afford it

32
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,750
if anything were to happen to you.

33
00:02:28,784 --> 00:02:30,256
(Minglan Hall)
Please come down.

34
00:02:31,355 --> 00:02:32,594
What are you doing?

35
00:02:33,001 --> 00:02:34,640
Stop moving them.

36
00:02:35,874 --> 00:02:37,915
Don't move my mother's things away.

37
00:02:38,675 --> 00:02:39,554
Don't!

38
00:02:39,675 --> 00:02:41,149
This is my mother's!

39
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:42,176
(Minglan Hall)

40
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,959
Don't tear it down. No!

41
00:02:47,115 --> 00:02:48,075
What are you doing?

42
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:49,675
Don't hurt the girl.

43
00:02:50,034 --> 00:02:51,075
Let go.

44
00:02:56,353 --> 00:02:58,243
(Qiao Yuechan)

45
00:02:59,675 --> 00:03:00,594
Mistress Qiao,

46
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:02,795
tell them to stop right now.

47
00:03:03,154 --> 00:03:04,994
This is your father's decision.

48
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:05,920
We need to change

49
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,152
the fengshui in this residence.

50
00:03:07,434 --> 00:03:07,955
Look.

51
00:03:08,235 --> 00:03:09,874
We are going to tear down this courtyard

52
00:03:09,947 --> 00:03:11,107
and make a big pond.

53
00:03:11,395 --> 00:03:12,195
Isn't that great?

54
00:03:12,515 --> 00:03:13,075
That way,

55
00:03:13,154 --> 00:03:14,795
your grandma's health will improve,

56
00:03:15,274 --> 00:03:17,754
and your father will receive a promotion

57
00:03:17,795 --> 00:03:19,034
in the court.

58
00:03:19,075 --> 00:03:19,554
No!

59
00:03:19,915 --> 00:03:20,915
This courtyard

60
00:03:20,944 --> 00:03:22,432
is the only thing Mother left for me.

61
00:03:22,475 --> 00:03:23,754
Stop it!

62
00:03:24,274 --> 00:03:25,635
You can't go.

63
00:03:25,915 --> 00:03:26,515
Yining,

64
00:03:26,754 --> 00:03:28,675
they will hurt you.

65
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:30,258
You can't go inside.

66
00:03:30,412 --> 00:03:31,531
Let go of me.

67
00:03:35,434 --> 00:03:36,355
Mistress Qiao!

68
00:03:36,395 --> 00:03:37,034
Mistress Qiao!

69
00:03:37,834 --> 00:03:39,034
Send for a physician now.

70
00:03:39,235 --> 00:03:39,795
All right.

71
00:03:39,834 --> 00:03:40,395
Mistress Qiao!

72
00:03:42,594 --> 00:03:43,395
My dear,

73
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,640
it's my fault.

74
00:03:46,384 --> 00:03:48,184
I failed to keep the baby.

75
00:03:49,115 --> 00:03:50,515
I know

76
00:03:50,675 --> 00:03:51,714
you care a lot

77
00:03:51,834 --> 00:03:53,314
about this child.

78
00:03:54,955 --> 00:03:56,235
You have done nothing wrong.

79
00:03:58,515 --> 00:03:59,675
This should've been

80
00:04:00,994 --> 00:04:03,115
our first son.

81
00:04:14,336 --> 00:04:15,633
(Luo Chengzhang)

82
00:04:15,675 --> 00:04:16,314
Yining,

83
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,920
I have forgiven you

84
00:04:21,355 --> 00:04:22,994
for anything you did before,

85
00:04:23,514 --> 00:04:25,115
but I won't this time.

86
00:04:27,595 --> 00:04:29,035
I will ask you once more.

87
00:04:31,074 --> 00:04:32,475
Do you admit your fault?

88
00:04:32,795 --> 00:04:34,155
I don't!

89
00:04:35,394 --> 00:04:36,314
Maids.

90
00:04:40,275 --> 00:04:41,634
Take her to the Ancestral Shrine.

91
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,590
She is to kneel!

92
00:04:42,915 --> 00:04:43,795
Without my permission,

93
00:04:43,994 --> 00:04:45,074
she is not allowed to leave!

94
00:04:46,864 --> 00:04:49,230
(Parents are to blame for failing
to discipline their children.)

95
00:04:49,235 --> 00:04:50,835
(If you keep spoiling her,)

96
00:04:50,835 --> 00:04:51,629
(I believe this girl)

97
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:52,784
(would bring bigger trouble)

98
00:04:52,848 --> 00:04:53,790
(to the Luo Family.)

99
00:04:53,954 --> 00:04:55,475
(Yuechan lost the baby)

100
00:04:55,514 --> 00:04:57,355
(because of her.)

101
00:04:57,355 --> 00:04:59,155
(Send Yining)

102
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,821
(to her mother's side yard.)

103
00:05:01,355 --> 00:05:04,275
(Grandma, do I really have to go?)

104
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:06,235
(I don't want you to stay)

105
00:05:06,275 --> 00:05:07,355
(with Mistress Qiao.)

106
00:05:07,394 --> 00:05:09,074
(This is for your own good.)

107
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,200
If I had grown up in Luo's Residence,

108
00:05:15,219 --> 00:05:15,844
I can't imagine

109
00:05:15,874 --> 00:05:17,275
what I would've become.

110
00:05:17,475 --> 00:05:18,754
Young Lady, don't you want

111
00:05:18,768 --> 00:05:19,650
to prove your innocence

112
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,879
about what happened back then?

113
00:05:22,475 --> 00:05:24,795
Mistress Qiao is cunning.

114
00:05:25,235 --> 00:05:26,595
Besides,

115
00:05:26,722 --> 00:05:28,042
it has been so many years.

116
00:05:28,448 --> 00:05:30,368
I don't think I could find any clues.

117
00:05:31,954 --> 00:05:32,754
Anyway,

118
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,760
those who believe you
will always believe you.

119
00:05:34,784 --> 00:05:35,760
Those who don't believe you

120
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:38,080
won't change their mind
no matter how hard you try to explain.

121
00:05:39,394 --> 00:05:40,595
Someone fainted up ahead.

122
00:05:47,155 --> 00:05:47,754
Young Lady,

123
00:05:47,754 --> 00:05:49,074
he seems like a refugee.

124
00:05:52,754 --> 00:05:54,754
Qing Qu, take his pulse.

125
00:05:54,994 --> 00:05:56,715
Xue Zhi, go get some food

126
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:57,580
and clothes.

127
00:05:57,874 --> 00:05:58,554
Yes, Young Lady.

128
00:06:07,275 --> 00:06:08,194
This is strange.

129
00:06:08,715 --> 00:06:09,434
Everything seems

130
00:06:09,514 --> 00:06:10,434
pretty normal.

131
00:06:18,235 --> 00:06:20,035
Let's go get some medicine
from the carriage.

132
00:06:25,232 --> 00:06:26,190
Get in the carriage.

133
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:29,552
You are wearing
fine brocade undergarments.

134
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,521
You are not a refugee.

135
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,880
What exactly are you after?

136
00:06:32,554 --> 00:06:34,275
You are quite smart.

137
00:06:35,155 --> 00:06:36,194
But it's too late.

138
00:06:36,355 --> 00:06:37,355
Let go of her.

139
00:06:37,386 --> 00:06:37,906
Stay still.

140
00:06:38,394 --> 00:06:40,227
Otherwise, I will kill her immediately.

141
00:06:40,272 --> 00:06:41,110
Get in the carriage.

142
00:06:42,514 --> 00:06:43,394
Qing Qu.

143
00:06:44,915 --> 00:06:45,434
Go.

144
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:53,979
It's you again.

145
00:06:54,194 --> 00:06:55,314
Who on earth are you?

146
00:06:55,419 --> 00:06:56,938
Why do you keep chasing after me?

147
00:06:56,963 --> 00:06:57,643
Li Yinglong,

148
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,321
you know very well

149
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,800
what you have done over the years.

150
00:07:00,844 --> 00:07:02,323
We are just doing the right thing

151
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,641
to claim your life.

152
00:07:31,235 --> 00:07:31,715
Give chase.

153
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:48,064
- Young Lady.
- Young Lady.

154
00:07:50,275 --> 00:07:51,434
Are you all right, Young Lady?

155
00:07:51,874 --> 00:07:53,514
Luckily, they are fighting each other.

156
00:07:53,664 --> 00:07:54,850
That man didn't come after me.

157
00:07:56,715 --> 00:07:57,754
Qing Qu, Xue Zhi,

158
00:07:58,042 --> 00:07:58,683
let's leave.

159
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:03,754
Young Master,

160
00:08:04,115 --> 00:08:05,475
we are pretending to hunt him down.

161
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,760
I believe this fellow

162
00:08:06,804 --> 00:08:07,884
will soon seek refuge

163
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,761
from the mastermind

164
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,160
who set Official Chen up back then.

165
00:08:10,192 --> 00:08:11,640
Qi An will keep a close eye on him.

166
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:12,939
Except for him,

167
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,624
(Luo Shenyuan)
we need to rely on ourselves.

168
00:08:14,835 --> 00:08:16,115
We must find the statement.

169
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:17,630
The statement is hidden in that painting

170
00:08:17,659 --> 00:08:18,380
of Old Master Luo.

171
00:08:18,464 --> 00:08:19,840
But we've already searched through

172
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:20,788
many of his paintings.

173
00:08:21,954 --> 00:08:22,994
No matter what,

174
00:08:23,915 --> 00:08:25,514
I must clean my master's name.

175
00:08:25,856 --> 00:08:27,590
Today is Old Madam Luo's
birthday banquet.

176
00:08:28,394 --> 00:08:30,115
We need to head back

177
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,230
before anyone notices us.

178
00:08:31,312 --> 00:08:32,176
Yes, Young Master.

179
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:34,985
(Luo's Residence)

180
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:35,710
Congratulations.

181
00:08:36,064 --> 00:08:36,750
This way, please.

182
00:08:37,152 --> 00:08:37,830
Please come in.

183
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:04,551
Arrange more people

184
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:05,640
over there.

185
00:09:05,696 --> 00:09:07,150
Also, keep an eye on this side as well.

186
00:09:07,312 --> 00:09:07,791
Yes.

187
00:09:09,371 --> 00:09:10,891
Please take a seat over there.

188
00:09:11,271 --> 00:09:11,871
Sure.

189
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:13,671
Congratulations.

190
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,680
Thank you.

191
00:09:14,736 --> 00:09:16,630
(Lin Hairu)
We have many guests. Please pardon us.

192
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,495
This way, please.

193
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,854
Madam Jiang of Vice Minister
of Imperial Court of Judicial has arrived.

194
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,200
Madam Jiang.

195
00:09:23,504 --> 00:09:25,465
Greetings, Madam Jiang.

196
00:09:27,571 --> 00:09:29,170
Oh, it's Madam Jiang.

197
00:09:30,225 --> 00:09:31,345
It has been a while.

198
00:09:31,451 --> 00:09:33,451
(Chen Lan)
Old Madam Luo often speaks of you.

199
00:09:33,904 --> 00:09:35,425
Greetings, Madam Chen.

200
00:09:35,569 --> 00:09:37,650
My husband said
the Jiang and Luo Families

201
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,960
have a longstanding relationship

202
00:09:39,075 --> 00:09:40,274
and that we should maintain it.

203
00:09:40,578 --> 00:09:41,937
That's why I mustn't miss out

204
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,328
on Old Madam Luo's birthday banquet.

205
00:09:44,211 --> 00:09:45,931
Please take me to greet
Old Madam Luo now.

206
00:09:46,195 --> 00:09:47,595
No rush, Madam Jiang.

207
00:09:47,984 --> 00:09:49,905
You can have some tea
in the yard first.

208
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:51,290
Old Madam Luo will come later.

209
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:53,749
I heard Master Jiang

210
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:54,768
has recently been promoted

211
00:09:54,768 --> 00:09:56,520
to Vice Minister
of Imperial Court of Judicial.

212
00:09:56,631 --> 00:09:57,950
Congratulations.

213
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,080
It's the Jiang Family's blessing

214
00:10:00,137 --> 00:10:01,856
to receive such recognition
from His Majesty.

215
00:10:02,496 --> 00:10:04,480
First Master Luo has been posted
out of the capital

216
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:05,920
and is not returning this time, is he?

217
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:06,759
Right.

218
00:10:07,042 --> 00:10:07,981
But the gift he prepared

219
00:10:08,033 --> 00:10:10,113
for Old Madam Luo has arrived.

220
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,200
Madam Jiang, this way, please.

221
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:14,798
This way.

222
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,840
Be careful.

223
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:25,759
Madam Li.

224
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,944
You must be Madam Li,
wife of Vice Prefect Li, right?

225
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:31,720
Greetings, Madam Li.

226
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,279
You must be Madam Lin,

227
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,090
the principal wife
of Second Master Luo, right?

228
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:36,639
You are truly elegant.

229
00:10:37,152 --> 00:10:38,910
This is the birthday gift
for Old Madam Luo.

230
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,080
Madam Li,

231
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,224
this is Madam Lin.

232
00:10:43,266 --> 00:10:45,307
She is Mistress Qiao, the concubine.

233
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,600
Madam Li, pardon us for the confusion.

234
00:10:47,999 --> 00:10:49,840
Rui Xiang, collect the gift.

235
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,240
You flatter me, Madam Li.

236
00:10:53,281 --> 00:10:55,001
Today is Old Madam Luo's
birthday banquet.

237
00:10:55,169 --> 00:10:56,328
Second Master Luo sent me here

238
00:10:56,417 --> 00:10:57,697
to help around.

239
00:10:58,159 --> 00:11:00,480
Bi Yi, collect the gift.

240
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:01,432
Yes.

241
00:11:01,482 --> 00:11:03,002
Madam Li, please come this way.

242
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,400
You look gorgeous in these clothes.

243
00:11:05,544 --> 00:11:07,424
Really? That's very kind of you.

244
00:11:12,024 --> 00:11:14,398
(Old Madam Luo)

245
00:11:22,992 --> 00:11:25,670
(Muxi Hall)

246
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:26,399
Mother,

247
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,879
most guests have arrived.

248
00:11:28,905 --> 00:11:30,545
The prayer ceremony is soon beginning.

249
00:11:30,736 --> 00:11:33,217
Shall I accompany you out later?

250
00:11:33,775 --> 00:11:34,895
No rush.

251
00:11:35,313 --> 00:11:37,393
Some haven't come yet.

252
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,279
Who hasn't come yet?

253
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,120
By the way,

254
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:42,480
Madam Jiang, wife of
the newly appointed Vice Minister

255
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,519
of Imperial Court of Judicial
has arrived.

256
00:11:46,531 --> 00:11:48,960
Madam Jiang came here

257
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:50,360
to discuss the marriage pact

258
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,639
between the Jiang and Luo Families

259
00:11:51,664 --> 00:11:53,904
your father arranged back then.

260
00:11:54,549 --> 00:11:57,628
Chengzhang, what's your plan?

261
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,679
I plan

262
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:05,080
to marry Yilian off to their son.

263
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,480
You must know

264
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:09,120
that Yining is your legitimate daughter.

265
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,080
It's not appropriate

266
00:12:11,121 --> 00:12:12,920
to marry off a concubine's daughter.

267
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,759
Mother, I would like to

268
00:12:16,655 --> 00:12:18,296
discuss this with you.

269
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,560
I wanted

270
00:12:19,647 --> 00:12:21,007
to put Yilian under Hairu's name

271
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,720
after your birthday banquet.

272
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,720
That way, she can have

273
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,232
a rightful and legitimate status.

274
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,080
As you know,

275
00:12:28,105 --> 00:12:30,105
it was unfair to Yuechan

276
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,790
to marry me as a concubine back then.

277
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,480
Master Qiao

278
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:35,320
has become an erudite now.

279
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:37,679
Besides, the Qiao Family
is a scholarly family.

280
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,200
They are not considered

281
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,919
below the station of the Jiang Family.

282
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,181
I see.

283
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,919
You have resented me all these years.

284
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:57,680
You blamed me
for marrying Minglan to you.

285
00:12:57,816 --> 00:12:58,855
That's why

286
00:12:59,365 --> 00:13:02,101
you couldn't take Mistress Qiao
as your principal wife.

287
00:13:02,975 --> 00:13:04,255
Chengzhang,

288
00:13:04,852 --> 00:13:06,931
as a father,

289
00:13:07,885 --> 00:13:09,365
you have been neglecting Yining

290
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,080
over the past years.

291
00:13:12,513 --> 00:13:13,472
I wouldn't dare.

292
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,679
Mother, to be fair,

293
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:22,148
Yining is stubborn.
She refused to return home.

294
00:13:22,173 --> 00:13:23,653
You...

295
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:24,840
Old Madam.

296
00:13:25,049 --> 00:13:25,369
Here.

297
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,559
Mother.

298
00:13:26,745 --> 00:13:27,744
Hurry.

299
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,120
Here's the medicine.

300
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:30,960
Mother,

301
00:13:31,129 --> 00:13:32,928
you have to take care of your health.

302
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,159
Give me your hand.

303
00:13:36,536 --> 00:13:38,217
I don't want to see you.

304
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,639
I will enter the hall

305
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,320
when it's time.

306
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:45,560
All right, Mother.

307
00:13:48,039 --> 00:13:49,759
Old Madam, please sit.

308
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:51,840
Careful.

309
00:13:52,542 --> 00:13:53,743
Slow down.

310
00:13:58,223 --> 00:13:59,863
Why is Chengzhang

311
00:14:01,038 --> 00:14:02,717
completely under the control

312
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:05,399
of Mistress Qiao?

313
00:14:05,696 --> 00:14:06,456
Old Madam,

314
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:08,240
today's your birthday.

315
00:14:08,273 --> 00:14:09,473
Please simmer down.

316
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,679
Fortunately,

317
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,561
you sent Seventh Lady away back then.

318
00:14:12,624 --> 00:14:14,576
If not, she would've been spoiled
by Mistress Qiao.

319
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,240
If it weren't

320
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:20,440
for my poor health condition,

321
00:14:21,381 --> 00:14:26,440
I would've kept Yining with me

322
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:29,440
and taken great care of her.

323
00:14:38,692 --> 00:14:40,879
(Luo's Residence)

324
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,160
Congratulations.

325
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:49,904
Congratulations.

326
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,080
Young Lady, do you have a name card?

327
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,064
What name card?

328
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:57,790
This is Seventh Lady
of Luo's Residence.

329
00:14:57,808 --> 00:14:58,320
She came back

330
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,824
to celebrate Old Madam Luo's birthday.

331
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,240
Seventh Lady?

332
00:15:01,495 --> 00:15:03,056
We don't have a seventh lady here.

333
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:05,375
I have lived in the side yard
since I was a kid.

334
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:07,673
Bring Butler Bai to meet me.

335
00:15:07,808 --> 00:15:09,080
We are busy welcoming the guests.

336
00:15:09,104 --> 00:15:10,816
We don't have time
to run an errand for you.

337
00:15:10,929 --> 00:15:11,888
Wait over there.

338
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,872
- What's with your attitude...
- Qing Qu.

339
00:15:14,128 --> 00:15:15,510
Today is Grandma's
birthday banquet.

340
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:16,560
Don't make a scene here.

341
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,320
Young lady,

342
00:15:18,448 --> 00:15:19,649
do you know what place this is?

343
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:22,039
We can report you to the yamen.

344
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,720
Filial piety is a fundamental ethic
of the dynasty.

345
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:27,960
I promised Grandma that I'd return

346
00:15:27,985 --> 00:15:29,304
to celebrate her birthday,

347
00:15:29,719 --> 00:15:32,040
and it would be unfilial of me
not to show up.

348
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:34,840
Since you wouldn't let me in,

349
00:15:34,903 --> 00:15:36,104
I won't bear the blame

350
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:37,370
if Grandma is furious.

351
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,160
Naturally, it will
be your responsibility.

352
00:15:40,999 --> 00:15:43,360
Seventh Lady, finally you have arrived.

353
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,440
Old Madam has been waiting for you.

354
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,879
Butler Bai, the servants

355
00:15:46,999 --> 00:15:47,960
- are truly...
- Xue Zhi.

356
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,679
Did they upset you?

357
00:15:51,728 --> 00:15:53,200
They don't know me. I don't blame them.

358
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,120
Besides,

359
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,824
it's true that I haven't
returned for years.

360
00:15:55,944 --> 00:15:57,145
Butler Bai,

361
00:15:57,202 --> 00:15:59,202
please take me to greet Grandma.

362
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,600
Yes, Young Lady.

363
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,039
Please.

364
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:14,320
Madam Jiang,

365
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,200
do you really want to break off
the engagement?

366
00:16:20,261 --> 00:16:21,159
Old Madam Luo,

367
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,960
I didn't intend to bring this up

368
00:16:22,984 --> 00:16:23,944
on a day like this.

369
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:25,840
But...

370
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,799
Going back on the engagement

371
00:16:27,864 --> 00:16:29,145
is dishonorable.

372
00:16:29,647 --> 00:16:30,727
Not even a merchant

373
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:32,519
would do such a thing.

374
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,521
Madam Jiang,

375
00:16:36,724 --> 00:16:38,805
the marriage pact between
the Luo and Jiang Families

376
00:16:38,999 --> 00:16:41,200
was decided by my husband

377
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,879
and your great-grandpa-in-law.

378
00:16:43,999 --> 00:16:46,039
This isn't a child's play.

379
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:47,919
How about this?

380
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,320
You can

381
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,720
discuss this with your in-laws

382
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,639
before you make the decision.

383
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,281
You are right, Old Madam Luo.

384
00:17:00,336 --> 00:17:01,440
In that case, I will return

385
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,801
and inform my in-laws.

386
00:17:03,136 --> 00:17:05,080
Then, I'll come back
to break off the engagement.

387
00:17:06,768 --> 00:17:08,230
Is she really here to send blessings?

388
00:17:08,313 --> 00:17:09,953
She's causing discomfort.

389
00:17:17,639 --> 00:17:19,280
The tea served here

390
00:17:19,399 --> 00:17:20,560
is great.

391
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,000
Are these the new tea leaves
from regions south of the Yangtze River?

392
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,559
These were sent

393
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:27,159
by Madam Lin's maternal family.

394
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,000
They are harvested
from the Fujian region.

395
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:30,656
The wind and soil conditions
are favorable.

396
00:17:30,688 --> 00:17:32,870
Hence, the tea leaves are flavorful.

397
00:17:33,199 --> 00:17:34,800
My maternal family said

398
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,009
the finest quality tea leaves like these

399
00:17:37,034 --> 00:17:38,954
are priceless.

400
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,161
Madam Lin,

401
00:17:42,199 --> 00:17:43,520
you know a lot about tea.

402
00:17:43,639 --> 00:17:45,080
I would like to taste

403
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,920
your tea.

404
00:17:48,879 --> 00:17:51,199
I can only talk about tea,

405
00:17:51,223 --> 00:17:52,863
but I can't brew tea.

406
00:17:55,239 --> 00:17:56,679
I shouldn't have mentioned this.

407
00:17:56,919 --> 00:17:58,560
I believe the tea ceremony

408
00:17:58,719 --> 00:18:02,000
isn't part of the household education
of merchants.

409
00:18:02,239 --> 00:18:03,199
Rightfully so.

410
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,959
I, Yining, wish you a happy birthday,
Grandma.

411
00:18:23,494 --> 00:18:26,575
May you live to a ripe old age

412
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,919
and always stay well.

413
00:18:29,719 --> 00:18:30,879
Get up.

414
00:18:31,399 --> 00:18:32,439
Thank you, Grandma.

415
00:18:36,363 --> 00:18:38,919
Ning, you are finally here.

416
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,800
Mother, it has been a long while.

417
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,761
How have you been?

418
00:18:43,959 --> 00:18:44,919
I'm fairing well.

419
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,159
It's great that you are back.

420
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:54,000
Greetings, Aunt.

421
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,440
We haven't met for over ten years.

422
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,959
You have grown up.

423
00:18:59,879 --> 00:19:02,159
Old Madam Luo, who is this?

424
00:19:02,439 --> 00:19:04,120
This is my legitimate granddaughter,

425
00:19:04,296 --> 00:19:06,495
the Seventh Lady, Yining.

426
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:07,520
Yining,

427
00:19:07,901 --> 00:19:09,661
this is Madam Jiang.

428
00:19:11,246 --> 00:19:12,807
Greetings, Madam Jiang.

429
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:14,623
Grandma,

430
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,199
I prepared a gift

431
00:19:16,224 --> 00:19:17,105
for you.

432
00:19:39,168 --> 00:19:43,872
(Longevity)

433
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:08,639
Grandma,

434
00:20:08,959 --> 00:20:10,840
here's my gift.

435
00:20:11,552 --> 00:20:14,320
This paper-cutting piece is called
"Goddess of Hemp Presents Longevity".

436
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:17,160
I made it for you.

437
00:20:17,870 --> 00:20:19,744
May you be as prosperous
as the Sun and Moon

438
00:20:19,744 --> 00:20:22,112
and live as long as immortal cranes
and evergreen pine trees.

439
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,679
Thank you.

440
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,320
This paper-cutting piece

441
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:30,280
is vivid.

442
00:20:30,814 --> 00:20:32,614
You must've put
a lot of effort into this.

443
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,040
It must be tough for you.

444
00:20:34,199 --> 00:20:35,520
Not at all.

445
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,000
Mother.

446
00:20:39,344 --> 00:20:40,940
- Greetings, Grandma.
- Greetings, Grandma.

447
00:20:40,944 --> 00:20:41,904
Greetings, Grandma.

448
00:20:42,494 --> 00:20:43,603
(Luo Yiyu, Luo Yilian)

449
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:44,752
(Luo Yixiu)

450
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,040
Greetings, Father.

451
00:20:50,439 --> 00:20:52,479
Greetings, brother, sister, and cousins.

452
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:54,758
Yining, you are back.

453
00:20:55,479 --> 00:20:56,439
It's Grandma's birthday.

454
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:57,730
Of course, I should come back.

455
00:20:58,760 --> 00:20:59,679
Chengzhang,

456
00:21:00,058 --> 00:21:01,539
you haven't seen Yining for years.

457
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,879
Didn't you notice

458
00:21:03,239 --> 00:21:05,600
she has grown a lot?

459
00:21:06,639 --> 00:21:07,439
Grandma,

460
00:21:07,879 --> 00:21:10,040
I have prepared another gift for you.

461
00:21:34,744 --> 00:21:35,463
Grandma,

462
00:21:35,879 --> 00:21:38,159
when I was sorting
Grandpa's paintings,

463
00:21:38,439 --> 00:21:40,239
I saw many portraits of your image.

464
00:21:40,239 --> 00:21:42,230
(Portraits of Young Madam Luo)

465
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,239
Besides, the Luo Family

466
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:46,080
is a century-old family
with abundant goodness,

467
00:21:46,184 --> 00:21:47,424
where we were rewarded

468
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:48,619
by the late Emperor previously,

469
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,552
and you were conferred

470
00:21:49,632 --> 00:21:51,312
with an honorary title by His Majesty.

471
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:54,144
Hence, I imitated
Grandpa's paintings and drew these.

472
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:54,920
(Luo Xuanyuan)

473
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,360
(Luo Shanyuan)

474
00:21:57,966 --> 00:22:00,926
"So long the road.

475
00:22:01,439 --> 00:22:05,320
When I look back, time flies by.

476
00:22:05,581 --> 00:22:07,540
I lament how short life is.

477
00:22:08,399 --> 00:22:09,959
No ambitions fulfilled,

478
00:22:11,719 --> 00:22:13,959
only my hair turning white."

479
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,799
Grandma, did Grandpa write that?

480
00:22:22,130 --> 00:22:23,610
Sixty years have flown by

481
00:22:24,627 --> 00:22:27,266
in the blink of an eye.

482
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,479
Your Grandpa

483
00:22:31,887 --> 00:22:33,407
has left us

484
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:35,800
for years.

485
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,760
You still have us.

486
00:22:39,199 --> 00:22:41,239
Right.

487
00:22:41,830 --> 00:22:42,989
It's best

488
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,040
when the whole family stays together

489
00:22:45,719 --> 00:22:46,679
harmoniously.

490
00:22:48,272 --> 00:22:50,256
Indeed, it looks
quite similar to Father's.

491
00:22:50,959 --> 00:22:52,439
Many officials in the imperial court

492
00:22:52,879 --> 00:22:53,800
still admire

493
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,199
Father's artworks

494
00:22:55,224 --> 00:22:56,504
and want to have a look.

495
00:22:57,199 --> 00:22:59,360
Yining, you are considerate.

496
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,360
Seventh Lady lives up
to the expectations

497
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:04,400
of the Luo Family's legitimate daughter.

498
00:23:04,481 --> 00:23:05,640
Your painting skills

499
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,681
have put Yiyu's to shame.

500
00:23:08,639 --> 00:23:10,639
I told you father many times

501
00:23:10,793 --> 00:23:12,352
that we should bring you back.

502
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,120
Many years have passed.

503
00:23:14,225 --> 00:23:16,184
Let's not dwell on the past.

504
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:17,679
You have matured a lot

505
00:23:17,722 --> 00:23:19,002
over the past years.

506
00:23:19,136 --> 00:23:21,120
You are growing up to be a lot
like your mother.

507
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:23,479
Thank you for concerning us,
Mistress Qiao.

508
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:25,440
My late Mother
would be very grateful to you

509
00:23:25,479 --> 00:23:27,000
if she knew that.

510
00:23:27,639 --> 00:23:29,159
Late Mother?

511
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:30,120
Yining,

512
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,440
what are you getting at?

513
00:23:31,465 --> 00:23:33,705
Mistress Qiao
is showing concern for you.

514
00:23:34,959 --> 00:23:37,120
Like mother, like daughter.

515
00:23:37,145 --> 00:23:37,826
Enough.

516
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,280
Today is
Old Madam's birthday banquet.

517
00:23:40,439 --> 00:23:43,184
It's rude to speak without regard
for the situation.

518
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:52,879
Ms. Li,

519
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:55,520
the Luo Residence is a grand place.

520
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:57,350
As expected from the reward
of the late Emperor.

521
00:23:57,368 --> 00:23:58,729
This mansion was rewarded

522
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:00,350
during the time
of the late Old Master Luo.

523
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,399
It was the proudest time

524
00:24:01,424 --> 00:24:03,104
for the Luo Family back then.

525
00:24:04,246 --> 00:24:05,006
Ms. Li,

526
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:06,600
is Seventh Lady the daughter

527
00:24:06,925 --> 00:24:07,965
of Second Master's

528
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,719
previous wife, Madam Gu?

529
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,280
She is certainly stealing
the thunder today.

530
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,281
Old Madam

531
00:24:13,344 --> 00:24:15,470
has always doted on the Seventh Lady
since she was a kid.

532
00:24:15,504 --> 00:24:17,230
Even Second Master
can't discipline her.

533
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,719
Be sure to show her respect

534
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,192
when you run into her in the future.

535
00:24:20,399 --> 00:24:21,439
If you rub her the wrong way,

536
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,479
even Mistress Qiao can't help you.

537
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,760
I'm new to this place,

538
00:24:24,959 --> 00:24:27,360
but I have heard a lot

539
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,000
that Madam Gu was vicious.

540
00:24:30,064 --> 00:24:30,896
Before her passing,

541
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,008
she tried to set Mistress Qiao up
several times.

542
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,199
As for Seventh Lady,

543
00:24:34,399 --> 00:24:35,439
Mistress Qiao

544
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,639
used to treat her

545
00:24:36,664 --> 00:24:37,545
like her own daughter.

546
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,639
However, she was ungrateful

547
00:24:39,712 --> 00:24:41,712
and intentionally pushed
the pregnant Mistress Qiao.

548
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,320
Like mother, like daughter.

549
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:45,744
So Second Master sent her away

550
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:46,896
and forbade her from returning.

551
00:24:46,959 --> 00:24:48,600
It's all in the past.

552
00:24:48,679 --> 00:24:49,879
Don't bring it up anymore.

553
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:50,919
Yes.

554
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:52,065
That's nonsense.

555
00:24:52,239 --> 00:24:53,080
Ms. Li.

556
00:24:53,239 --> 00:24:54,120
Seventh Lady.

557
00:24:54,679 --> 00:24:55,879
The servants

558
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:57,184
lack proper discipline.

559
00:24:57,190 --> 00:24:59,840
- Please forgive us, Seventh Lady.
- Please forgive us, Seventh Lady.

560
00:25:00,127 --> 00:25:00,808
Seventh Lady,

561
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,120
they are from the side yard.

562
00:25:03,168 --> 00:25:04,512
They are not familiar with the rules.

563
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,879
Please show them mercy

564
00:25:06,278 --> 00:25:07,799
and not punish them.

565
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,320
I won't punish them.

566
00:25:09,639 --> 00:25:11,120
Today is
Grandma's birthday banquet.

567
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,360
No one should ruin it.

568
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,439
Yes.

569
00:25:20,199 --> 00:25:20,719
Young Lady,

570
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,839
they must've been slandering

571
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,927
both you and Madam Gu

572
00:25:22,950 --> 00:25:24,624
while you were away all these years.

573
00:25:24,959 --> 00:25:25,520
Young Lady,

574
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:26,919
should I

575
00:25:26,944 --> 00:25:28,183
teach them a lesson?

576
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,879
If I were to punish them,

577
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:33,025
the rumors would only get worse.

578
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,320
It's just that I didn't expect that,

579
00:25:35,376 --> 00:25:36,937
except for me,

580
00:25:36,962 --> 00:25:38,442
they wouldn't go easy on my mother.

581
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,080
Once the celebration is over,

582
00:25:41,136 --> 00:25:42,457
we will head back tomorrow.

583
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,719
So beautiful.

584
00:26:14,879 --> 00:26:15,639
Yiyu,

585
00:26:15,808 --> 00:26:16,929
let's set off some fireworks,

586
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,280
and pray for Grandma's well-being.

587
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:18,800
Sure.

588
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:29,800
Yining,

589
00:26:29,936 --> 00:26:30,800
you just return home.

590
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,208
I'll take you to set off fireworks.

591
00:26:32,224 --> 00:26:33,040
It's fun.

592
00:26:33,399 --> 00:26:34,040
Me?

593
00:26:34,239 --> 00:26:36,280
They don't like playing with me.

594
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:37,682
Do you also...

595
00:26:38,639 --> 00:26:39,600
Not at all.

596
00:26:39,655 --> 00:26:40,655
Yixiu, you are cute.

597
00:26:40,728 --> 00:26:42,199
I would love to play with you.

598
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:42,919
Really?

599
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,430
You should've come back sooner.

600
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,440
Let's go.

601
00:26:50,719 --> 00:26:51,280
Yining,

602
00:26:51,368 --> 00:26:52,648
let me show you.

603
00:26:52,713 --> 00:26:53,553
I'm going to set off

604
00:26:53,585 --> 00:26:55,050
the biggest and brightest fireworks.

605
00:26:55,056 --> 00:26:55,408
Sure.

606
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,040
Wait here. I'm going to get one.

607
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,879
(So she's Luo Yining.)

608
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:22,880
Seventh Lady,

609
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:24,800
why are you here alone?

610
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,360
You should try this, too.

611
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,096
Be careful of the firework tube.

612
00:27:55,753 --> 00:27:56,289
Yining,

613
00:27:56,439 --> 00:27:57,560
let's go.

614
00:27:59,264 --> 00:28:00,624
Coming through. Excuse me.

615
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,439
Come. Over here.

616
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,600
Look at that.

617
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,280
Yining,

618
00:28:23,328 --> 00:28:24,448
if you don't need this now,

619
00:28:24,512 --> 00:28:25,270
give it to me.

620
00:28:38,479 --> 00:28:39,520
Madam Jiang!

621
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,239
Are you all right?

622
00:29:05,728 --> 00:29:06,968
Madam Jiang,

623
00:29:08,199 --> 00:29:10,600
I'm truly sorry
about what happened earlier.

624
00:29:10,681 --> 00:29:12,840
I will come by another day
to personally apologize.

625
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,792
There's no need for that.

626
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,560
Please stop here, Madam Chen.

627
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:17,199
The children were just

628
00:29:17,224 --> 00:29:18,343
fooling around.

629
00:29:18,439 --> 00:29:19,560
No need to feel bad.

630
00:29:30,879 --> 00:29:31,840
Stop crying.

631
00:29:35,959 --> 00:29:36,959
Stop crying.

632
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,199
Second Master,

633
00:29:43,639 --> 00:29:46,199
I checked the firework tubes
several times.

634
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:47,840
I didn't expect

635
00:29:47,888 --> 00:29:49,449
the accident to happen.

636
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:50,919
I failed

637
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:54,080
to teach her properly.

638
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:02,800
Mother,

639
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:05,639
Yilian didn't mean for this to happen.

640
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,600
She got injured, too.

641
00:30:07,959 --> 00:30:08,560
Fortunately,

642
00:30:08,768 --> 00:30:10,528
Madam Jiang wasn't hurt.

643
00:30:10,879 --> 00:30:13,560
Mother, please forgive her.

644
00:30:14,719 --> 00:30:16,399
She's truly

645
00:30:16,424 --> 00:30:17,744
a lost cause.

646
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,879
Such a spoilsport.

647
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:21,439
Right.

648
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,080
Greetings, Old Madam.

649
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,760
Father, why did you call for me?

650
00:30:32,719 --> 00:30:34,320
Shanyuan said

651
00:30:34,569 --> 00:30:36,249
he saw you in the yard earlier today.

652
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:37,791
Didn't I tell you

653
00:30:38,286 --> 00:30:40,087
not to leave your yard today?

654
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,664
I just wanted to give Old Madam

655
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,160
a pot of plum plants for her birthday.

656
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,000
Who are you
to present gifts for Old Madam?

657
00:30:49,479 --> 00:30:50,840
Know your place.

658
00:30:51,479 --> 00:30:53,639
Go and kneel at the Ancestral Shrine.

659
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:55,320
Don't get up without my permission.

660
00:30:55,529 --> 00:30:56,129
Yes, Father.

661
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,320
Father,

662
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,840
he did nothing wrong.

663
00:31:02,896 --> 00:31:04,688
He only wanted
to celebrate Grandma's birthday.

664
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,720
Why does that warrant
a harsh punishment?

665
00:31:06,808 --> 00:31:07,929
Does this concern you?

666
00:31:08,439 --> 00:31:09,959
Why are you questioning this?

667
00:31:14,879 --> 00:31:15,800
Yining,

668
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,919
you just returned here,

669
00:31:17,969 --> 00:31:19,408
and you should behave.

670
00:31:19,959 --> 00:31:21,000
Mistress Qiao

671
00:31:21,239 --> 00:31:23,199
has forgiven what you have done before,

672
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:24,679
but you must still

673
00:31:24,919 --> 00:31:26,199
watch your manners.

674
00:31:26,719 --> 00:31:27,600
True.

675
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,400
It has been years.

676
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,400
I have already forgotten.

677
00:31:30,639 --> 00:31:32,280
You rarely come back.

678
00:31:32,305 --> 00:31:33,625
Our family is finally reunited.

679
00:31:33,698 --> 00:31:35,297
Everyone should be happy, right?

680
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,152
Stop mentioning it
if you have forgotten.

681
00:31:40,432 --> 00:31:42,150
Seeing that you have always been unfair

682
00:31:42,184 --> 00:31:43,545
in how you punish your children,

683
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,879
I have nothing to say.

684
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:46,959
Yining.

685
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,159
How dare you talk back.

686
00:31:49,399 --> 00:31:50,360
That was unexpected.

687
00:31:50,385 --> 00:31:51,385
I thought you had changed

688
00:31:51,467 --> 00:31:52,787
after all these years, but you...

689
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,479
You haven't changed at all.

690
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:58,760
In that case, you will kneel with him.

691
00:31:58,959 --> 00:31:59,800
Chengzhang!

692
00:31:59,936 --> 00:32:00,740
Second Master,

693
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,961
even if Yining upset you,

694
00:32:02,961 --> 00:32:05,184
there's no need to send her
to kneel at the Ancestral Shrine.

695
00:32:05,199 --> 00:32:06,199
Chengzhang,

696
00:32:06,639 --> 00:32:08,320
Yining has just returned.

697
00:32:08,345 --> 00:32:09,785
What exactly are you doing?

698
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:10,959
Grandma,

699
00:32:11,879 --> 00:32:13,080
if Father wishes to punish me,

700
00:32:13,115 --> 00:32:14,034
I will do as he says.

701
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:15,639
Otherwise,

702
00:32:15,696 --> 00:32:17,270
he will accuse me of not being obedient.

703
00:32:18,639 --> 00:32:19,360
Mother,

704
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,879
Yining needs discipline.

705
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,760
She disrespected her father
in front of everyone,

706
00:32:25,399 --> 00:32:26,520
so she must be punished.

707
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:50,560
I'm sorry

708
00:32:51,203 --> 00:32:52,842
to drag you into this.

709
00:32:53,439 --> 00:32:54,280
It's nothing.

710
00:32:54,959 --> 00:32:56,199
You have helped me, too.

711
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,120
How did you know

712
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,919
about the defective firework tube?

713
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,879
Anyway, be more careful in the future.

714
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,760
You also call him Father?

715
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,360
If so,

716
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,760
you are...

717
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:18,840
Don't force yourself

718
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,281
if you can't remember anything.

719
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,800
I heard your paintings

720
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,919
resemble Old Master's.

721
00:33:29,879 --> 00:33:31,479
Did you learn from him?

722
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,560
I moved to the side yard

723
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,199
when I was six.

724
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:40,120
I left too early
to learn painting from him.

725
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,639
A few of his paintings were stored

726
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:44,480
in the peach blossom forest
in the side yard.

727
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,439
Old Madam

728
00:33:46,529 --> 00:33:48,089
is especially fond of you.

729
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,760
I couldn't make it back

730
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,800
when Grandpa passed away,

731
00:33:53,639 --> 00:33:55,360
so Grandma gave me

732
00:33:55,385 --> 00:33:56,425
some of his paintings

733
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:57,959
to learn from

734
00:33:58,399 --> 00:33:59,520
and remember him by.

735
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:23,600
Kneel on this. It's soft.

736
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:25,319
Thank you.

737
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,400
What happened to your hand?

738
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:38,120
It's an old injury.

739
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,801
I just can't use too much strength.

740
00:34:44,410 --> 00:34:46,530
(Am I overthinking this?)

741
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:49,799
Once we get out of here,

742
00:34:49,826 --> 00:34:51,104
I will send for a physician

743
00:34:51,129 --> 00:34:52,129
to check on your injury.

744
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:54,880
Perhaps it can be cured.

745
00:34:57,008 --> 00:34:58,220
I will thank you in advance.

746
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,872
Yining traveled all the way back here

747
00:35:05,936 --> 00:35:07,440
and has been kneeling for a long time.

748
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:09,319
She won't be able to take it.

749
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,160
You hadn't come yet

750
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:14,820
when Yining was a kid,

751
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,920
but you still care so much

752
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,440
about her.

753
00:35:18,615 --> 00:35:20,016
All these years,

754
00:35:20,319 --> 00:35:21,319
it has been you

755
00:35:21,542 --> 00:35:24,062
who accompanied me to visit her
in the side yard.

756
00:35:25,239 --> 00:35:26,719
I may be blunt,

757
00:35:27,112 --> 00:35:28,433
but I know

758
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:30,199
who is good and who is not.

759
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:32,159
Yining is a good girl.

760
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:35,159
Mother, should we send someone there...

761
00:35:35,319 --> 00:35:37,880
You think I don't worry about her?

762
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,719
But I couldn't oppose Chengzhang

763
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:42,299
in front of everyone.

764
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:44,279
It would've only deepened the rift

765
00:35:44,312 --> 00:35:45,953
between him and Yining.

766
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,560
Tell him

767
00:35:54,917 --> 00:35:56,478
I'm going to retire for the night.

768
00:35:57,199 --> 00:35:59,839
He's the one taking charge
of Luo's Residence now.

769
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:03,840
I'm old
and can't make any decisions now.

770
00:36:04,086 --> 00:36:05,566
I have given him enough respect

771
00:36:05,639 --> 00:36:07,319
as a mother.

772
00:36:07,622 --> 00:36:09,062
But I will go fetch my granddaughter

773
00:36:09,821 --> 00:36:12,142
first thing in the morning.

774
00:36:24,279 --> 00:36:24,799
Come.

775
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:26,679
I made you

776
00:36:26,713 --> 00:36:28,113
some mind-soothing Babao tea.

777
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,239
When you go back,

778
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,120
comfort Lian.

779
00:36:37,239 --> 00:36:38,040
I'm also curious

780
00:36:38,065 --> 00:36:39,386
why the firework tube

781
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:41,120
suddenly exploded.

782
00:36:43,776 --> 00:36:45,310
Perhaps the immoral merchant substituted

783
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:46,720
defective fireworks for inferior ones.

784
00:36:46,768 --> 00:36:48,032
That's why the accident happened.

785
00:36:49,719 --> 00:36:51,986
I have already punished Ms. Li severely.

786
00:36:54,296 --> 00:36:56,776
By the way, Old Madam...

787
00:36:57,159 --> 00:36:58,159
It's expected.

788
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,600
She scolded me

789
00:36:59,799 --> 00:37:01,120
and wouldn't even let me in.

790
00:37:01,518 --> 00:37:02,917
Mother has always

791
00:37:02,961 --> 00:37:04,555
spoiled Yining, and that's why

792
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,080
she has been mischievous
since she was a kid.

793
00:37:07,319 --> 00:37:08,560
I don't think she has changed

794
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:09,960
after returning this time.

795
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:12,000
Old Madam treats her granddaughter well,

796
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,880
and it's unfair to you.

797
00:37:14,199 --> 00:37:15,400
I think she brought

798
00:37:15,432 --> 00:37:17,032
Seventh Lady back

799
00:37:17,088 --> 00:37:19,670
because of the marriage pact
between the Luo and Jiang Families.

800
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,120
It seems Madam Jiang

801
00:37:21,192 --> 00:37:22,592
has second thoughts about it.

802
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,279
The Jiang Family

803
00:37:25,304 --> 00:37:27,824
is thriving now
and has bright prospects.

804
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,040
But the marriage pact
decided by the previous generation

805
00:37:30,159 --> 00:37:32,719
can't be broken off easily.

806
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:33,679
Tomorrow,

807
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,759
I will visit the Jiang's Residence.

808
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,360
If we become in-laws with them,

809
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,120
it would be great.

810
00:37:40,239 --> 00:37:41,440
It will also benefit

811
00:37:41,489 --> 00:37:42,648
your future career.

812
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:45,799
It's just that...

813
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,480
Yuechan, I know what you want.

814
00:37:53,561 --> 00:37:55,720
Honestly, I also favored Yilian.

815
00:37:56,319 --> 00:37:57,759
But I can't go against

816
00:37:58,279 --> 00:37:59,600
Mother's wish.

817
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,080
Besides, Yilian almost hurt Madam Jiang

818
00:38:02,112 --> 00:38:04,312
with the firecracker.

819
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,040
I think

820
00:38:08,799 --> 00:38:10,239
we should give up on this.

821
00:38:22,639 --> 00:38:24,960
The Seventh Lady
is a legitimate daughter

822
00:38:25,557 --> 00:38:27,716
and Old Madam's favorite.

823
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,681
I have always been

824
00:38:31,199 --> 00:38:32,639
a burden to Lian

825
00:38:32,688 --> 00:38:34,009
due to my identity.

826
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,359
Yuechan,

827
00:38:43,574 --> 00:38:45,654
I understand you have resentments.

828
00:38:47,799 --> 00:38:49,359
I promised

829
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,440
to take you my principal wife,

830
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,199
but my mother...

831
00:38:55,159 --> 00:38:56,440
Of course, I have resentments.

832
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,799
How could I not resent it?

833
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,400
However,

834
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,040
I'm still glad

835
00:39:06,319 --> 00:39:08,279
that I have been with you

836
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:11,799
all along.

837
00:39:12,759 --> 00:39:13,639
Yuechan,

838
00:39:14,199 --> 00:39:15,040
don't worry.

839
00:39:15,111 --> 00:39:16,271
As long as I'm here,

840
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,560
you and our children
will get what you deserve.

841
