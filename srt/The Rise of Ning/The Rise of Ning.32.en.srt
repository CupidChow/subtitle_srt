Training Handbook" from Jinjiang Literature)

=Episode 32=

4
00:01:39,798 --> 00:01:46,446
(Yanrong Pavilion)

5
00:01:57,041 --> 00:01:57,840
Marquis Lu,

6
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,521
why are you here
so early in the morning?

7
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,680
I heard you've become
the County Princess

8
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,984
and came here to congratulate you.

9
00:02:07,681 --> 00:02:08,640
Have you been

10
00:02:08,881 --> 00:02:10,121
waiting here the whole night?

11
00:02:10,441 --> 00:02:11,240
Yes.

12
00:02:11,601 --> 00:02:13,680
I think of it as welcoming
the New Year with you.

13
00:02:15,721 --> 00:02:16,520
Mei,

14
00:02:17,001 --> 00:02:17,960
do you still remember

15
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:20,160
when we used to welcome
the New Year together?

16
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,760
I don't remember.

17
00:02:22,441 --> 00:02:23,240
Back then,

18
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,161
I kept a stalk of Queen of the Night

19
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,960
and told you it would bloom at night.

20
00:02:27,321 --> 00:02:29,920
You crouched and waited
in front of the flower the whole night.

21
00:02:31,881 --> 00:02:34,121
Later, we knew the flower
would only bloom in summer.

22
00:02:34,121 --> 00:02:34,881
Marquis Lu.

23
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,696
If there's nothing else,

24
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,090
I'm heading to Duke Ying's Residence
to pay my New Year's greeting.

25
00:02:40,096 --> 00:02:40,840
Mei.

26
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,640
The first day of the New Year

27
00:02:44,841 --> 00:02:46,881
is a day when families reunite

28
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,240
but it only means

29
00:02:49,869 --> 00:02:51,160
I've spent

30
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,721
a year alone

31
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:53,960
as usual.

32
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:56,721
If you have something to say,

33
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,128
just say it directly, Marquis Lu.

34
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,760
Did you feel aggrieved
at Duke Ying's Residence?

35
00:03:04,601 --> 00:03:06,041
Duke Ying's Residence treats me well.

36
00:03:06,601 --> 00:03:08,480
Why do you say that, Marquis Lu?

37
00:03:08,561 --> 00:03:09,920
If you are well-treated,

38
00:03:11,001 --> 00:03:12,281
why have you come out

39
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,161
on the first day of New Year's Eve?

40
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:16,640
This has nothing
to do with you, Marquis Lu.

41
00:03:16,721 --> 00:03:17,559
If so,

42
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,488
does it have anything to do
with Luo Shenyuan?

43
00:03:20,121 --> 00:03:20,960
Mei,

44
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:22,401
since both of you

45
00:03:22,401 --> 00:03:23,760
aren't siblings,

46
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,264
you should avoid seeing each other.

47
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,121
Why did he

48
00:03:26,121 --> 00:03:27,760
come out at night instead

49
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:28,960
of staying at Luo's Residence?

50
00:03:29,161 --> 00:03:31,441
These things are
none of your concern, Marquis Lu.

51
00:03:31,884 --> 00:03:33,240
Qing Qu, let's go.

52
00:03:49,561 --> 00:03:51,879
Grandma, I wish you prosperity

53
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,216
and the best of health every year.

54
00:03:57,041 --> 00:03:57,841
Father,

55
00:03:58,001 --> 00:04:00,161
I hope you can rise to prominence

56
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,360
and achieve success.

57
00:04:02,401 --> 00:04:03,721
I also wish you could

58
00:04:03,721 --> 00:04:05,321
be happy every day.

59
00:04:14,161 --> 00:04:15,601
Old Madam was wondering

60
00:04:15,601 --> 00:04:16,641
when you would

61
00:04:16,641 --> 00:04:17,920
return to the residence today.

62
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,761
She was expecting you.

63
00:04:18,761 --> 00:04:21,320
No one can be closer
than their grandparents.

64
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,761
You should have a good relationship.

65
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,920
Thank you, Grandma.

66
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,161
Yining.

67
00:04:26,352 --> 00:04:27,753
What's your decision

68
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,281
regarding the shop?

69
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,360
Mother.

70
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,920
Why are you so anxious?

71
00:04:32,081 --> 00:04:34,161
I'm just chatting with her casually.

72
00:04:38,401 --> 00:04:41,841
Yining, the Luo family
is a family of academic background.

73
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,601
Old Madam Luo and Madam Lin

74
00:04:44,601 --> 00:04:46,081
love you so much.

75
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,560
I'm sure

76
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,721
you can live a lavish life
at Luo's Residence.

77
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:53,200
Why have you thought about
opening your own shop?

78
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:55,560
Grandma,

79
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,239
when I was at Luo's Residence,

80
00:04:58,601 --> 00:05:00,961
I lived in the side yard
when I was young.

81
00:05:01,161 --> 00:05:03,480
I sneaked out often

82
00:05:03,601 --> 00:05:05,680
and saw some women's lives.

83
00:05:05,961 --> 00:05:06,761
I don't want

84
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,641
to live like them.

85
00:05:08,721 --> 00:05:10,082
How do they live?

86
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,560
By relying on others.

87
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,360
What do you mean?

88
00:05:16,721 --> 00:05:19,081
Before a woman is married,
she relies on her parents.

89
00:05:19,161 --> 00:05:20,920
Her background will decide

90
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,736
what kind of person
she will be married to.

91
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,081
After she is married,
she will rely on her husband.

92
00:05:25,401 --> 00:05:26,560
If she is lucky,

93
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,920
the husband and wife live in harmony
and her life will be smooth.

94
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,240
If she is unlucky,

95
00:05:30,401 --> 00:05:32,680
she will have to fight
with other concubines.

96
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,761
I don't want to live a life like that.

97
00:05:37,201 --> 00:05:39,401
Isn't that how a woman's life has gone

98
00:05:39,401 --> 00:05:41,161
since ancient times?

99
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,920
You are different, Grandma.

100
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,201
You used your own strength

101
00:05:45,201 --> 00:05:47,761
and proved that women
are no weaker than men.

102
00:05:47,761 --> 00:05:50,161
I also want to learn from Grandma.

103
00:05:50,521 --> 00:05:53,320
Not only can women
marry and give birth to children,

104
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,240
but they can also
establish a career of their own

105
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,161
with their own ability.

106
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,281
You are ambitious.

107
00:05:59,521 --> 00:06:00,761
As expected of my daughter.

108
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,161
When Young Lady Yining said those words,

109
00:06:03,161 --> 00:06:04,161
she had your elegance

110
00:06:04,161 --> 00:06:05,641
when you were young, Old Madam.

111
00:06:05,721 --> 00:06:07,399
Didn't you go on the battlefield

112
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,992
at this age?

113
00:06:09,008 --> 00:06:10,430
You've never regretted or complained

114
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,856
no matter how badly you were injured.

115
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,360
It is rare for you

116
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,521
to have this resolve.

117
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,920
However, you can't be
free of all worries

118
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,880
in this world

119
00:06:19,961 --> 00:06:22,161
just by being independent or strong.

120
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,320
You should know your limits

121
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,641
when you do anything.

122
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,239
I will remember
what you said, Grandma.

123
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,560
Grandma, that's enough.

124
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,961
Stop asking Yining

125
00:06:33,961 --> 00:06:36,320
to remember so many things
on the first day of the New Year.

126
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,480
Grandma,

127
00:06:39,761 --> 00:06:41,000
I envy you

128
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,320
when you speak about your past.

129
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:44,001
I'm reluctant to leave you.

130
00:06:44,281 --> 00:06:46,161
Otherwise, I also want to be like Father

131
00:06:46,161 --> 00:06:47,761
and kill our enemies at the border.

132
00:06:48,761 --> 00:06:51,201
Do you think war is fun?

133
00:06:51,201 --> 00:06:53,041
You've taught me martial arts
since young

134
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:54,600
and praised me
for being a quick learner.

135
00:06:54,601 --> 00:06:56,161
If I don't use my skills out there,

136
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,721
wouldn't it be a waste

137
00:06:57,721 --> 00:06:58,761
of your effort?

138
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,360
Yining,

139
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,880
when are you moving back?

140
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,961
I'll go back and pack my things.

141
00:07:06,961 --> 00:07:09,120
When I'm done packing in a few days,

142
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,360
I will move back.

143
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,961
Are you willing to move back?

144
00:07:15,761 --> 00:07:17,761
This should be how
the legitimate daughter

145
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,721
of Duke Ying's Residence should behave.

146
00:07:29,201 --> 00:07:30,120
Madam,

147
00:07:30,201 --> 00:07:31,920
is it a letter from Old Madam Lin again?

148
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,440
Right.

149
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,761
What did she say?

150
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,161
She scolded me.

151
00:07:40,512 --> 00:07:41,588
Is it because of the wedding

152
00:07:41,601 --> 00:07:43,120
of Sixth Young Lady
and Sixth Master Lin?

153
00:07:44,961 --> 00:07:45,761
She said

154
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,521
if I can't keep Lin Mao in check,

155
00:07:48,721 --> 00:07:50,320
I should send him back to Lin'an

156
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,920
and let her deal with him.

157
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,320
Why don't you

158
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,560
go and persuade her again?

159
00:07:57,161 --> 00:07:57,920
How could I do that?

160
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,761
Who should I persuade?

161
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,424
(Muxi Hall)

162
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,161
Mother,

163
00:08:16,081 --> 00:08:17,320
I asked the kitchen

164
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,880
to prepare some snacks for you.

165
00:08:19,201 --> 00:08:20,161
Please try it.

166
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:29,000
Sending me snacks
so early in the morning.

167
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,761
Hairu,

168
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,521
you have something to say, right?

169
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,641
I...

170
00:08:49,361 --> 00:08:50,161
Mother.

171
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,440
Do you already know

172
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,160
about Lin Mao and Sixth Young Lady?

173
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,481
After what Lin Mao shouted

174
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:58,161
on New Year's Eve,

175
00:08:58,881 --> 00:09:01,560
do you think there will still be people
who don't know about it?

176
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,281
I watched

177
00:09:06,121 --> 00:09:07,560
my younger brother, Lin Mao, grow up.

178
00:09:08,361 --> 00:09:09,761
Since young, he has been blunt.

179
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,560
If he doesn't like something,

180
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,761
he won't even bat an eye to it.

181
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,881
However, he will never give up

182
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,161
something he fancies easily.

183
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,440
My impression of Lin Mao

184
00:09:22,761 --> 00:09:24,920
is a good kid.

185
00:09:26,001 --> 00:09:26,920
Hairu.

186
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,320
Do your parents know about this?

187
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,920
I'm here to get your advice

188
00:09:32,001 --> 00:09:33,320
regarding this.

189
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:37,960
Lin Mao is the only son

190
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,481
of the Lin family.

191
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,799
Sixth Young Lady is a good kid.

192
00:09:46,161 --> 00:09:48,241
They don't know her

193
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:50,635
and have too many concerns.

194
00:09:51,761 --> 00:09:52,680
Perhaps...

195
00:09:55,521 --> 00:09:57,080
Perhaps it will be better

196
00:09:58,161 --> 00:09:59,161
after some time.

197
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,400
Look at you.

198
00:10:01,521 --> 00:10:03,440
You sound so unconfident.

199
00:10:05,361 --> 00:10:08,920
I went to the Lin family back then
to propose.

200
00:10:09,121 --> 00:10:10,560
I had a conversation

201
00:10:11,121 --> 00:10:13,241
with your parents.

202
00:10:14,361 --> 00:10:15,641
Hairu.

203
00:10:16,281 --> 00:10:18,320
Both of us went through
many things in this world.

204
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,121
You should know this.

205
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,960
A good marriage

206
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,960
isn't as simple
as two people loving each other.

207
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,241
I am still alive now.

208
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,960
If something happens,

209
00:10:31,055 --> 00:10:33,560
I can still make a decision to help out.

210
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,920
What about the future?

211
00:10:35,161 --> 00:10:36,960
Have you thought about the future?

212
00:10:37,521 --> 00:10:38,041
I...

213
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,521
Parents will

214
00:10:43,761 --> 00:10:46,001
sometimes break up a couple

215
00:10:46,001 --> 00:10:48,161
but they are not heartless.

216
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,080
It's because they know

217
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,761
that once a person

218
00:10:51,761 --> 00:10:53,680
takes a wrong step in life,

219
00:10:54,226 --> 00:10:56,267
his life will be ruined.

220
00:10:57,771 --> 00:10:59,210
Mother, do you mean...

221
00:10:59,761 --> 00:11:01,241
Yixiu's marriage

222
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:04,320
is my business as her grandma.

223
00:11:05,161 --> 00:11:06,680
If I don't do well,

224
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,840
I will ruin her life.

225
00:11:11,001 --> 00:11:13,440
If I don't accept him sincerely,

226
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,361
I won't

227
00:11:15,761 --> 00:11:17,241
easily give away our children

228
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,960
as her grandma.

229
00:11:28,761 --> 00:11:29,560
That's it?

230
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,761
I was wondering why you called me here.

231
00:11:35,001 --> 00:11:36,320
How can you still smile?

232
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,121
Are you shocked

233
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,161
by their reactions?

234
00:11:41,361 --> 00:11:42,560
What do you plan to do?

235
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,121
I said I would marry Yixiu

236
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,680
and that is exactly
what I'm going to do.

237
00:11:48,121 --> 00:11:50,641
All right. Let me ask you.

238
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,320
If the family

239
00:11:52,881 --> 00:11:54,720
wants to cut ties with you,

240
00:11:55,001 --> 00:11:55,920
what will you do?

241
00:11:56,481 --> 00:11:58,479
Your business is not going well.

242
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,560
How long can you last
if you start a family on your own?

243
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,001
How can you feed your family?

244
00:12:02,001 --> 00:12:03,600
As long as I work hard with Yixiu,

245
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,881
we will not starve to death.

246
00:12:04,881 --> 00:12:06,281
What if our parents blackmail you

247
00:12:06,281 --> 00:12:07,080
with their lives?

248
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,121
Do you abandon our parents?

249
00:12:09,761 --> 00:12:11,281
You are the only son of the Lin family.

250
00:12:11,392 --> 00:12:13,640
Are you going to cut ties
with your family for your marriage?

251
00:12:14,121 --> 00:12:15,560
Yixiu is kind.

252
00:12:15,761 --> 00:12:17,161
What will she do?

253
00:12:17,881 --> 00:12:19,560
A marriage is not just about two people.

254
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,960
The Lin family harbours resentment
towards Yixiu

255
00:12:22,281 --> 00:12:23,440
and it is in Lin'an.

256
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,920
The Luo family will never
let Yixiu marry you.

257
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:28,761
Mao,

258
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,881
it's time for you to grow up.

259
00:12:36,121 --> 00:12:36,960
Are you saying

260
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,161
Duke Ying went to your residence

261
00:12:39,161 --> 00:12:40,361
to ask for military funds?

262
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:41,560
Yes, Master.

263
00:12:41,824 --> 00:12:43,320
Even the imperial court has no money.

264
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,080
What can I do
as the Vice Minister of Revenue?

265
00:12:46,296 --> 00:12:48,137
Even the military fund is lacking.

266
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,600
Not only
did he mention the funds,

267
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,680
but he also said
there was a problem with the warhorses.

268
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,481
Our tea and horse trade
might not be as good as the past

269
00:12:54,481 --> 00:12:56,241
but there won't be a problem.

270
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,761
Senior Yang,

271
00:13:00,960 --> 00:13:02,960
Duke Ying has a general

272
00:13:03,346 --> 00:13:05,881
who lost a battle

273
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,121
while quelling a minor conflict

274
00:13:08,224 --> 00:13:09,648
due to a warhorse problem.

275
00:13:10,281 --> 00:13:11,281
What is the problem?

276
00:13:11,761 --> 00:13:13,121
They want the best horses

277
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,641
but they got the poor-quality horses.

278
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,121
These horses couldn't run fast

279
00:13:17,281 --> 00:13:18,361
or run out of stamina quickly

280
00:13:18,361 --> 00:13:19,680
on the battlefield.

281
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,320
That's impossible.

282
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,960
The Ministry of Revenue

283
00:13:23,001 --> 00:13:24,720
gave money to purchase the best horses.

284
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,320
You mustn't joke about this.

285
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,121
Yes.

286
00:13:28,208 --> 00:13:30,240
Our soldiers are risking their lives
on the battlefield

287
00:13:30,304 --> 00:13:32,336
but there was a problem
with the warhorses.

288
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,641
Not only

289
00:13:33,641 --> 00:13:35,560
will it hurt the lives of our soldiers

290
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,521
but also our territory.

291
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:41,080
Shenyuan, you are right.

292
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,440
How do you plan to deal with this?

293
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,641
Since there's a problem,
we must investigate it.

294
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,881
The person who dares
tamper with warhorses

295
00:13:52,881 --> 00:13:55,080
has a power
that cannot be underestimated.

296
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,521
We mustn't rush this.

297
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,001
Otherwise, we will be seen

298
00:13:59,001 --> 00:14:00,800
as their enemies and be gotten rid

299
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,241
of before we can have a strong foothold.

300
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,161
As officials,

301
00:14:04,161 --> 00:14:04,840
shouldn't we work

302
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,401
to ensure the people's welfare?

303
00:14:06,401 --> 00:14:07,521
How can we

304
00:14:07,521 --> 00:14:08,320
do nothing because we

305
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,584
are afraid of the evil forces?

306
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,641
Senior Yang,

307
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,320
I know you are benevolent.

308
00:14:12,521 --> 00:14:14,121
You are passionate about changing

309
00:14:14,121 --> 00:14:15,840
everyone's fate in this world.

310
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:18,121
However, our opponent this time

311
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,560
is sinister and cruel.

312
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,560
We need to plan well

313
00:14:21,881 --> 00:14:22,960
before we act.

314
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,521
I don't believe it.

315
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,960
After our investigation

316
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,761
and finding out
what the mastermind is doing,

317
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,120
will His Majesty still side with him

318
00:14:30,281 --> 00:14:31,840
after we report it?

319
00:14:33,161 --> 00:14:34,881
I'm afraid we will be eliminated

320
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,521
before we can finish our investigation.

321
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,920
I, Yang Ling, am righteous.

322
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,136
I have nothing to be afraid of!

323
00:14:41,361 --> 00:14:42,281
Calm down.

324
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,481
Calm down.

325
00:14:46,784 --> 00:14:48,040
We can talk about this later.

326
00:14:49,761 --> 00:14:51,281
I heard you have some leads

327
00:14:51,712 --> 00:14:53,312
regarding the Eighth Prince's case.

328
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,641
Yes.

329
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:56,881
I've found Eighth Prince's body.

330
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,159
There are also dozens

331
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,880
of bodies belonging
to Tiger Head Gang members.

332
00:14:59,881 --> 00:15:01,960
His Majesty prioritizes this case.

333
00:15:02,704 --> 00:15:05,040
The Ministry of Justice
and Imperial Court of Judicial

334
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,680
found nothing
after investigating this case for years.

335
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,480
You cracked it as soon

336
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,020
as you joined
Imperial Court of Judicial.

337
00:15:10,521 --> 00:15:11,761
I'm afraid the truth behind this

338
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,161
isn't as simple as it seems.

339
00:15:14,361 --> 00:15:15,161
Master,

340
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,999
Shenyuan has keen insight.

341
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,528
He has a talent for investigating cases.

342
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,641
He is different from the officials

343
00:15:20,641 --> 00:15:21,761
who are not doing their jobs.

344
00:15:32,608 --> 00:15:34,120
His Majesty is in the imperial study.

345
00:15:34,161 --> 00:15:35,680
Minister Luo, please follow me.

346
00:15:43,761 --> 00:15:44,960
Luo Shenyuan actually found

347
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,041
the Eighth Prince's dead body.

348
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,960
He also met His Majesty at the palace.

349
00:15:48,521 --> 00:15:50,121
Will he find something?

350
00:15:50,361 --> 00:15:52,761
Today's garlic is fresh.

351
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,720
Come. Sit down and eat.

352
00:16:02,121 --> 00:16:04,680
Gao Da, you've been working for me

353
00:16:06,087 --> 00:16:07,288
for more than a decade, right?

354
00:16:07,521 --> 00:16:08,320
Chancellor Wang,

355
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,881
it has been 15 years.

356
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,680
Why are you still so impatient then?

357
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,600
Eighth Prince

358
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,440
was killed by the Tiger Head Gang

359
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,560
and not you.

360
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,680
Why are you so nervous?

361
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,320
Someone saw me before

362
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,481
the Tiger Head Gang took action.

363
00:16:23,664 --> 00:16:24,624
Although

364
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,800
I've completely eliminated
the Tiger Head Gang back then,

365
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,320
I'm afraid someone

366
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,560
might ruin your plan

367
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,361
if someone survived and exposed me.

368
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,440
Look. What is this?

369
00:16:43,352 --> 00:16:45,551
You didn't tie up loose ends back then.

370
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,960
There were indeed remnants
of the Tiger Head Gang

371
00:16:48,001 --> 00:16:50,080
who recognize you.

372
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,041
I neglected my duty.

373
00:16:53,161 --> 00:16:54,361
Please punish me.

374
00:16:55,521 --> 00:16:57,440
All right. Stand.

375
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,840
Thank you, Chancellor Wang.

376
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,961
Luo Shenyuan asked someone to send this.

377
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:10,241
Luo Shenyuan?

378
00:17:10,921 --> 00:17:12,721
He was also the one who requested

379
00:17:12,921 --> 00:17:13,961
for a retrial of this case.

380
00:17:13,961 --> 00:17:16,761
He is either retrying this case

381
00:17:17,001 --> 00:17:19,080
to gain His Majesty's favor

382
00:17:19,281 --> 00:17:20,080
or

383
00:17:21,961 --> 00:17:23,481
he has some other objectives.

384
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,880
Can we trust this person?

385
00:17:27,201 --> 00:17:29,840
We can keep observing him.

386
00:17:29,961 --> 00:17:31,360
I thought

387
00:17:31,761 --> 00:17:33,721
he was the same as Sun Jie and the rest

388
00:17:34,281 --> 00:17:35,761
who opposed me

389
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,599
by being on the side of justice

390
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:39,120
and working for the people.

391
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,640
Right now, it seems like

392
00:17:44,961 --> 00:17:47,160
he is quite a sensible person.

393
00:17:50,721 --> 00:17:51,880
It does look like you.

394
00:18:04,657 --> 00:18:07,056
I am Li Quan.
Greetings, Young Lady Wei.

395
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,961
This is Butler Li.

396
00:18:10,081 --> 00:18:11,521
If you need anything here,

397
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:12,681
just find him.

398
00:18:12,922 --> 00:18:14,521
Everyone, stand.

399
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:15,890
Thank you, Young Lady Wei.

400
00:18:16,032 --> 00:18:18,192
(Duke Ying's Residence)

401
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,760
(Jing'an Hall)

402
00:18:23,761 --> 00:18:24,560
Yining,

403
00:18:25,481 --> 00:18:28,241
Old Madam lives in this house.

404
00:18:28,761 --> 00:18:30,521
I live in this house.

405
00:18:30,961 --> 00:18:31,761
Also,

406
00:18:31,921 --> 00:18:33,921
you can use the land here as you wish.

407
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,521
Plant as many types of plants
as you want.

408
00:18:41,521 --> 00:18:42,360
Look here.

409
00:18:42,481 --> 00:18:44,080
You'll be staying here from now on.

410
00:18:46,921 --> 00:18:48,800
I chose all these daily necessities

411
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,521
(Huanjing Pavilion)
they are carrying.

412
00:18:50,761 --> 00:18:52,441
Go back and see if you like them.

413
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,241
I like them. They are good.

414
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,120
Thank you, Father.

415
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,360
Why are you thanking me?

416
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,360
This residence belongs to you
in the future.

417
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,360
Look.

418
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,120
If you want anything,

419
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,160
just take it.

420
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,584
If you like something

421
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,560
that can't be found here,

422
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,360
I'll help you look for it. All right?

423
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:10,521
Thank you, Father.

424
00:19:10,528 --> 00:19:11,600
You are thanking me again.

425
00:19:11,681 --> 00:19:13,201
I've never seen you

426
00:19:13,201 --> 00:19:14,560
being so meticulous.

427
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,320
Father.

428
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,080
Grandma.

429
00:19:16,721 --> 00:19:17,560
Come here.

430
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:20,761
I've never seen

431
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,120
such fine porcelain before.

432
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:23,961
Yes.

433
00:19:23,961 --> 00:19:25,521
This is a reward from the palace.

434
00:19:25,521 --> 00:19:27,201
I have a set in my room.

435
00:19:27,201 --> 00:19:29,281
I'm giving this set to Yining.

436
00:19:30,281 --> 00:19:33,041
Grandma, you treat Yining so well.

437
00:19:33,961 --> 00:19:36,120
Mingzhu, just take it if you like it.

438
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,921
Don't listen to her.

439
00:19:37,921 --> 00:19:40,120
She is just trying to take advantage.

440
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,201
Don't you have enough
good things in your room?

441
00:19:43,201 --> 00:19:45,320
Grandma, don't say this.

442
00:19:45,521 --> 00:19:47,721
I'm embarrassed if you do this.

443
00:19:48,001 --> 00:19:48,521
Ting.

444
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,041
Ignore him.

445
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:55,041
He'll cause trouble
if he is not punished.

446
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:56,528
He is not suitable to meet others.

447
00:19:57,961 --> 00:19:59,400
Grandma. Mingzhu.

448
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,400
I brought

449
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,681
some good-quality cosmetics.

450
00:20:01,681 --> 00:20:03,761
Take a look and see
if you have anything you like.

451
00:20:07,721 --> 00:20:08,521
Grandma,

452
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,281
this is Clematis Oil.

453
00:20:10,281 --> 00:20:11,360
It is used to wash your hair

454
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,521
and reduce hair loss.

455
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:14,209
What a coincidence.

456
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:16,680
Old Madam has been having serious
hair loss for the last two years.

457
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,080
She is feeling troubled about this.

458
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,840
Does it smell nice?

459
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,640
It's not bad.

460
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,560
If you like it,

461
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,761
I have many of these.

462
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,761
Mingzhu, take a look.

463
00:20:26,761 --> 00:20:28,880
I have rouge and gouache.

464
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,360
See if you fancy any of them.

465
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,360
They all look good.

466
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,120
Take them all then.

467
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,080
I will accept your gift then.

468
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,241
Duke Ying, are you asking me

469
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,041
how to raise a daughter?

470
00:20:46,721 --> 00:20:48,281
Look.

471
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:51,041
You have official matters to do

472
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,961
and you have to
raise your daughter alone.

473
00:20:54,521 --> 00:20:55,761
However, Young Lady Sun

474
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,360
is gentle, kind,

475
00:20:58,641 --> 00:20:59,681
knowledgeable,

476
00:20:59,721 --> 00:21:01,160
and elegant.

477
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,120
So, I'm purposely

478
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,360
asking you for advice.

479
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,840
That's too much praise, Duke Ying.

480
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,120
In that case,

481
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,360
studying more is key.

482
00:21:14,721 --> 00:21:16,360
I think so too.

483
00:21:16,961 --> 00:21:19,560
However, what should I first do

484
00:21:19,961 --> 00:21:21,721
to let her study?

485
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,440
Find a good teacher.

486
00:21:24,921 --> 00:21:28,120
Don't you have a good teacher
at your residence already?

487
00:21:28,481 --> 00:21:29,320
Are you talking about

488
00:21:30,481 --> 00:21:31,961
Master Qi from my residence?

489
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,360
He is too strict.

490
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,921
He is good for Wei Ting

491
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,521
but I'm reluctant

492
00:21:41,001 --> 00:21:42,281
to let him teach Yining.

493
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,560
What kind of teacher

494
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,961
are you trying to find, Duke Ying?

495
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:49,921
One.

496
00:21:51,008 --> 00:21:52,127
He must be knowledgeable.

497
00:21:52,481 --> 00:21:53,800
He must be as knowledgeable

498
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:54,961
as you.

499
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:57,360
Two. He must be patient.

500
00:21:58,201 --> 00:21:59,281
He cannot be too strict.

501
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,761
Three. He must have a good character.

502
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,160
He can't be hot-tempered.

503
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:05,961
Four.

504
00:22:06,929 --> 00:22:08,449
He must look proper

505
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,721
and pleasing to the eye.

506
00:22:09,921 --> 00:22:11,560
Duke Ying, are you looking for a teacher

507
00:22:11,961 --> 00:22:13,320
or a son-in-law?

508
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,840
If I want to find a son-in-law,

509
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,961
I'll add 20 more conditions at least.

510
00:22:22,281 --> 00:22:23,120
Duke Ying.

511
00:22:24,681 --> 00:22:26,481
There's only one person in this world

512
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:27,921
who can fit

513
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,560
your requirements
to become the teacher you seek.

514
00:22:33,281 --> 00:22:33,800
Who is it?

515
00:22:43,201 --> 00:22:45,080
Officials, please wait here.

516
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,400
I will inform you when Duke Ying

517
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,560
is finished with his business.

518
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:48,360
Thank you.

519
00:22:54,528 --> 00:22:56,720
Since you started working
at Imperial Court of Judicial,

520
00:22:56,721 --> 00:22:57,681
you've been hardworking.

521
00:22:57,921 --> 00:22:58,961
The Grand Minister also

522
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,721
have praised you.

523
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,521
Even His Majesty

524
00:23:02,521 --> 00:23:04,241
is showing you respect.

525
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,360
That's too much praise, Marquis.

526
00:23:06,681 --> 00:23:07,360
A word of advice.

527
00:23:08,001 --> 00:23:09,360
Doing things in an extreme manner

528
00:23:09,961 --> 00:23:11,441
might not get you a good result.

529
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,880
It is my duty.

530
00:23:15,104 --> 00:23:16,960
There's no need for you
to be concerned about this.

531
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,041
Since you took care

532
00:23:18,041 --> 00:23:19,560
of Yining in Luo's Residence,

533
00:23:20,041 --> 00:23:22,160
I'm reminding you
not to waste your time.

534
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,880
You won't find anything.

535
00:23:25,961 --> 00:23:27,961
That's between me and her.

536
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,712
It's none of your business.

537
00:23:29,921 --> 00:23:30,560
Wei Yining

538
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,961
is now Duke Ying's legitimate daughter

539
00:23:32,961 --> 00:23:33,961
and the County Princess.

540
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,960
She is from a different family than you.

541
00:23:37,241 --> 00:23:39,001
You should avoid meeting her
in the future.

542
00:23:39,961 --> 00:23:42,961
I grew up with Yining.

543
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,441
Our relationship cannot
be surpassed by others.

544
00:23:45,681 --> 00:23:47,481
I also remind you

545
00:23:48,521 --> 00:23:50,241
not to chase people away, Marquis Lu.

546
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,961
Minister Luo,

547
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,800
do you really fancy her?

548
00:24:05,521 --> 00:24:06,640
You are her brother.

549
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:07,921
Marquis Lu,

550
00:24:08,521 --> 00:24:10,640
I'm afraid you've forgotten about this.

551
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,360
Yining and I

552
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,640
aren't siblings.

553
00:24:19,761 --> 00:24:21,721
Both of you, Duke Ying invites you both.

554
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,400
Father.

555
00:24:37,441 --> 00:24:39,800
Are you hiring a teacher to teach me?

556
00:24:40,001 --> 00:24:40,800
What?

557
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,201
Do you not want this?

558
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,721
Not really.

559
00:24:44,312 --> 00:24:46,033
However, I'm afraid

560
00:24:46,241 --> 00:24:48,241
no teacher is going
to teach me what I want to know.

561
00:24:49,441 --> 00:24:50,120
Yining,

562
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,921
our Residence is
a family with martial arts background

563
00:24:53,961 --> 00:24:55,201
instead of literary background.

564
00:24:55,241 --> 00:24:57,201
Moreover, the imperial court has started

565
00:24:57,201 --> 00:24:59,201
to prioritize
literary talents over martial prowess.

566
00:24:59,201 --> 00:25:01,400
I think studying

567
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,160
will be beneficial to you.

568
00:25:05,041 --> 00:25:06,521
However...

569
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,281
There's no need
to worry about your teacher.

570
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,961
He will be here later.

571
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,120
When he arrives,

572
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,360
I won't force you to accept him

573
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,360
when he's here later. All right?

574
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:17,961
Duke Ying.

575
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:20,961
Marquis Lu?

576
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,400
Father.

577
00:25:23,041 --> 00:25:25,521
Is he the teacher you hired?

578
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:26,961
Young Lady Wei,

579
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,400
I can teach you martial arts.

580
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,360
I'm afraid

581
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,816
literary knowledge isn't my forte.

582
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,721
However,
if Young Lady Wei is interested,

583
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,840
I can accompany you too.

584
00:25:36,481 --> 00:25:37,281
Just like how we...

585
00:25:37,281 --> 00:25:37,880
Marquis Lu.

586
00:25:40,721 --> 00:25:41,560
Please behave.

587
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:46,761
Luo Shenyuan.

588
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:47,961
Yining,

589
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,080
he is the teacher I hired.

590
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,160
Your imperial scholar brother.

591
00:25:52,921 --> 00:25:53,721
Minister Luo,

592
00:25:54,202 --> 00:25:55,321
I'll leave

593
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,560
Yining's study to you.

594
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,800
I've wanted
to practice calligraphy recently

595
00:26:14,681 --> 00:26:16,681
but I haven't touched the brush at all.

596
00:26:19,456 --> 00:26:20,480
It's a rare opportunity

597
00:26:20,481 --> 00:26:21,961
for you to have the time to do this.

598
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,721
When you were in Luo's Residence,

599
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:26,080
I still needed to haggle with you

600
00:26:26,681 --> 00:26:28,120
when I asked you to write.

601
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,201
Your turn.

602
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,721
Actually, I have something

603
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,281
that I haven't told you.

604
00:28:07,481 --> 00:28:09,320
I knew a long time ago
that we weren't siblings.

605
00:28:10,241 --> 00:28:11,320
You knew a long time ago?

606
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,560
After Physician Du examined you,

607
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:20,961
I went

608
00:28:20,961 --> 00:28:22,681
to Madam An who took care of your mother

609
00:28:22,681 --> 00:28:23,721
and found out about this.

610
00:28:26,921 --> 00:28:28,400
I was afraid telling you the truth

611
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,721
might hurt you a lot

612
00:28:31,481 --> 00:28:32,721
so I didn't tell you.

613
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,041
Why are you

614
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,441
telling me now?

615
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,120
Yining.

616
00:28:56,912 --> 00:28:59,320
I have not been treating you
like a sibling for a long time.

617
00:29:02,201 --> 00:29:03,160
I want to ask you

618
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,481

Third Brother, are you hungry?

don't like me as a man,

I will go back for now.

640
00:30:58,041 --> 00:30:59,360
Duke Ying, why did you

641
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,041
summon me here?

642
00:31:03,201 --> 00:31:04,681
It's nothing important.

643
00:31:04,921 --> 00:31:06,400
I just want to ask you

644
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,800
why you care so much

645
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,152
about the search for my daughter.

646
00:31:11,241 --> 00:31:12,201
To be frank with you,

647
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,041
I already knew Yining

648
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,320
when we were at the side yard.

649
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:19,001
I didn't expect her to be your daughter.

650
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,320
You knew each other from back then?

651
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:23,001
Yes.

652
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,360
Duke.

653
00:31:25,024 --> 00:31:27,480
The Wei family and Lu family
have been close for many years.

654
00:31:27,921 --> 00:31:29,481
If we can improve this relationship,

655
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,241
won't it be better?

656
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,400
Why does it look cloudy?

657
00:31:42,961 --> 00:31:43,761
Duke Ying,

658
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,721
I am loyal to Young Lady Wei.

659
00:31:47,481 --> 00:31:48,640
If you agree,

660
00:31:49,041 --> 00:31:50,481
I will use an 8-man palanquin

661
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,880
to marry Yining

662
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,880
and won't marry any concubines forever.

663
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,600
We were separated for many years.

664
00:32:00,241 --> 00:32:03,080
Now that I have finally
found my daughter,

665
00:32:03,761 --> 00:32:05,041
I am reluctant

666
00:32:05,201 --> 00:32:06,600
to marry her away right now.

667
00:32:07,281 --> 00:32:09,360
Thank you for your offer, Marquis Lu.

668
00:32:13,241 --> 00:32:14,281
I understand

669
00:32:14,761 --> 00:32:16,521
how much you love your daughter.

670
00:32:16,961 --> 00:32:18,001
When you want

671
00:32:18,441 --> 00:32:20,400
to discuss Yining's marriage one day,

672
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:23,041
I will visit again.

673
00:32:25,481 --> 00:32:26,281
Farewell.

674
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,424
I won't be sending you off.

675
00:32:54,921 --> 00:32:55,681
I...

676
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,441
I've liked you for a long time.

677
00:33:08,048 --> 00:33:09,648
What are you thinking about, Young Lady?

678
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,800
Qing Qu, Third Brother told me

679
00:33:14,481 --> 00:33:15,560
he liked me.

680
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,441
Third Young Master finally told you?

681
00:33:18,521 --> 00:33:21,001
I thought he would never tell you.

682
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,160
Do you know about it?

683
00:33:22,521 --> 00:33:24,241
It is obvious to anyone.

684
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,281
Third Young Master's feeling for you

685
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,640
is unmatched by others.

686
00:33:29,241 --> 00:33:30,120
But Young Lady,

687
00:33:30,721 --> 00:33:32,120
do you like Third Young Master?

688
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,281
Since he told me

689
00:33:35,481 --> 00:33:37,681
we weren't siblings,

690
00:33:39,201 --> 00:33:41,761
my heart has been racing.

691
00:33:42,761 --> 00:33:44,560
I don't know if it counts as liking him.

692
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,281
Young Lady.

693
00:33:51,041 --> 00:33:52,241
Duke Ying asked for these

694
00:33:52,241 --> 00:33:53,201
to be given to you.

695
00:33:54,481 --> 00:33:55,721
Does Mingzhu have them?

696
00:33:56,281 --> 00:33:57,441
They are all for you.

697
00:33:58,001 --> 00:34:00,120
Pick one of the dresses for me.

698
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,400
Give the rest to Mingzhu.

699
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:03,640
That's...

700
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,281
Just follow my orders.

701
00:34:06,721 --> 00:34:07,521
In the future,

702
00:34:07,761 --> 00:34:09,200
take half of everything

703
00:34:09,441 --> 00:34:11,560
given to me to Mingzhu.

704
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,001
If someone asks,

705
00:34:13,001 --> 00:34:14,961
tell them I told you to do so.

706
00:34:16,041 --> 00:34:17,280
Yes, Young Lady.

707
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:28,200
Old Madam, are you feeling better?

708
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,501
It's fine.

709
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,080
This is a chronic illness of mine.

710
00:34:36,401 --> 00:34:37,441
I heard

711
00:34:38,041 --> 00:34:40,200
Yining took half of the pearls

712
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,481
given by Wei Ling

713
00:34:41,521 --> 00:34:43,080
and gave them to Mingzhu.

714
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,080
Not only that.

715
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,439
Young Lady Yining

716
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,680
only took a pair of earrings
from that box of jewelry.

717
00:34:48,521 --> 00:34:49,560
This child

718
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,321
is too sensible.

719
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,280
What about Minghui Pavilion?

720
00:34:56,416 --> 00:34:57,880
Mingzhu gave a gift in return as well.

721
00:34:57,881 --> 00:34:59,720
She asked someone
to give Young Lady Yining

722
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,360
the jade bracelet
you gave her previously.

723
00:35:01,408 --> 00:35:02,208
Good.

724
00:35:02,961 --> 00:35:04,600
Let's take it one step at a time.

725
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:06,961
That's right.

726
00:35:06,961 --> 00:35:08,321
Open the treasury

727
00:35:08,321 --> 00:35:09,921
tomorrow morning

728
00:35:09,921 --> 00:35:12,600
and buy some head accessories for them.

729
00:35:13,841 --> 00:35:15,240
This year's Flowers Festival

730
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,001
is going to be organized
in our residence.

731
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,801
Our ladies

732
00:35:18,881 --> 00:35:20,881
must not lose in terms of appearance.

733
00:35:21,361 --> 00:35:22,160
Sure.

734
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,401
Grandma.

735
00:35:25,184 --> 00:35:27,120
I heard you are suffering
from a chronic illness.

736
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,841
Are you feeling better?

737
00:35:29,321 --> 00:35:30,841
Thanks for your concern.

738
00:35:30,841 --> 00:35:32,041
She is feeling better.

739
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:35,240
This is the medicine
brought here by Sixth Uncle.

740
00:35:35,401 --> 00:35:36,521
Let Grandma try it.

741
00:35:36,521 --> 00:35:37,160
Sure.

742
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,200
This is a chronic illness.

743
00:35:42,352 --> 00:35:44,080
A few imperial physicians
from the palace

744
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,720
have looked at me.

745
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:47,841
It can't be treated.

746
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:50,720
Sixth Uncle is good at making medicine.

747
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,160
Even Father praised it.

748
00:35:53,153 --> 00:35:54,434
Yes, Old Madam.

749
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,080
Since Young Lady Yining is filial,

750
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,080
give it a try.

751
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:57,881
Grandma.

752
00:35:57,921 --> 00:35:59,841
I also learned a massage technique

753
00:35:59,841 --> 00:36:01,240
from Qing Qu.

754
00:36:01,481 --> 00:36:02,680
See how it feels.

755
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,841
You've put in a lot of effort.

756
00:36:08,041 --> 00:36:09,001
No wonder

757
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,120
your grandma at Luo's Residence

758
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,481
likes you so much.

759
00:36:13,441 --> 00:36:14,600
Do you like me then?

760
00:36:15,001 --> 00:36:16,080
I do.

761
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,041
Of course, I like you.

762
00:36:18,441 --> 00:36:19,881
You are

763
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,680
my legitimate granddaughter.

764
00:36:22,961 --> 00:36:24,120
Quick, lie down.

765
00:36:45,632 --> 00:36:47,080
Young Lady Yining, you must be tired

766
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,264
after massaging for so long.
You should go back and rest.

767
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,760
Aren't you asleep?

768
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,801
I woke up when you came in.

769
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,401
I was wrong for disturbing you.

770
00:37:12,961 --> 00:37:15,080
Young Lady Yining is really kind.

771
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:16,280
Other people

772
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,080
would have left
if they saw you fell asleep.

773
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:22,560
A child who grows up in a residence

774
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,760
without a parent to love them

775
00:37:25,401 --> 00:37:28,640
will do everything cautiously.

776
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:32,280
They will do their best in everything.

777
00:37:33,001 --> 00:37:35,841
She also grew up outside the residence.

778
00:37:36,001 --> 00:37:37,361
It was tough for her.

779
00:37:37,632 --> 00:37:39,760
Now that she has returned
to Duke Ying's Residence,

780
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:40,441
she will

781
00:37:40,441 --> 00:37:42,841
be loved by you
and Duke Ying in the future.

782
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,041
Yining might have a title
granted by His Majesty

783
00:37:47,481 --> 00:37:49,961
but people still gossip about her.

784
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,801
I must let her

785
00:37:51,801 --> 00:37:53,200
become the legitimate daughter

786
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,200
of Duke Ying's Residence
in an open manner.

787
00:37:58,841 --> 00:38:01,160
My brother is asking me for help again.

788
00:38:03,961 --> 00:38:05,481
What is his relationship

789
00:38:05,481 --> 00:38:07,200
with Wei Yining?

790
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,559
I can see that Wei Yining

791
00:38:09,881 --> 00:38:10,881
has always been

792
00:38:10,881 --> 00:38:12,720
opposed to him.

793
00:38:12,881 --> 00:38:15,160
How should I reply to them?

794
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:21,120
I think Young Lady Yining

795
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:22,481
is also a scheming person.

796
00:38:22,521 --> 00:38:23,921
She went to Old Madam's place

797
00:38:23,921 --> 00:38:25,560
and has been serving her until now.

798
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:27,328
Isn't Grandma suffering from her

799
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:28,680
chronic illness and feeling unwell?

800
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,120
Why did she stay so long?

801
00:38:30,321 --> 00:38:32,001
She said she made medicine
for Old Madam

802
00:38:32,041 --> 00:38:33,521
to help her relieve her illness.

803
00:38:33,521 --> 00:38:34,961
Old Madam was very happy

804
00:38:34,961 --> 00:38:36,560
and spoke to her for a long time.

805
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,801
Grandma has always loved me.

806
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:44,001
Right now, she has started
to treat Yining well too.

807
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:44,841
Young Lady.

808
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:46,280
Wei Yining

809
00:38:46,401 --> 00:38:48,001
treats you nicely on the surface

810
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,401
but she keeps flattering the Duke

811
00:38:50,401 --> 00:38:51,401
and Old Madam.

812
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,160
You mustn't be coaxed

813
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,120
by her little gifts.

814
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:03,557
(Marquis Anbei's Residence)

815
00:39:06,976 --> 00:39:08,928
Mingzhu, you said
you wanted to choose flowers.

816
00:39:08,992 --> 00:39:10,760
Are you doing it
at Marquis Anbei's Residence?

817
00:39:10,921 --> 00:39:11,720
Yes, Yining.

818
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:13,320
The Flowers Festival is coming soon.

819
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:15,168
Every residence has brought in
some rare flowers.

820
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:16,400
My godbrother has the most.

821
00:39:16,432 --> 00:39:18,280
It's your first year
returning to our residence.

822
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,401
Your beauty

823
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,280
must surpass everyone
during the Flowers Festival.

824
00:39:21,481 --> 00:39:22,881
Later, you must bring more flowers

825
00:39:22,881 --> 00:39:24,321
back to the residence.

826
00:39:25,401 --> 00:39:26,640
I suddenly

827
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,441
feel unwell.

828
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:30,760
Why don't you

829
00:39:30,801 --> 00:39:31,961
choose the flowers on your own?

830
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,001
Young Lady Yining. Young Lady Mingzhu.

831
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:37,640
Greetings, Young Master Cheng.

832
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,080
Is my godbrother inside?

833
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,400
Uncle is busy.

834
00:39:41,001 --> 00:39:43,280
He can't choose flowers with both of you

835
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,120
and ordered me to guide you both.

836
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:48,120
Please go to the garden
to choose the flowers on your own.

837
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:54,120
Yining, my godbrother
isn't free to accompany me.

838
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,640
If you don't accompany me,

839
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,720
I'll be

840
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,600
so bored today.

841
00:40:00,441 --> 00:40:01,401
Fine.

842
00:40:01,841 --> 00:40:03,841
I'll accompany you today.

843
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,001
This is nice.

844
00:40:13,001 --> 00:40:13,801
That one too.

845
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,080
Yining, which do you think is nice?

846
00:40:18,921 --> 00:40:20,841
I think they are all good.

847
00:40:21,481 --> 00:40:23,041
Since you like all of them,

848
00:40:23,481 --> 00:40:24,841
let's bring

849
00:40:25,041 --> 00:40:26,001
all these away.

850
00:40:26,944 --> 00:40:28,600
As long as Young Lady Yining likes them,

851
00:40:28,841 --> 00:40:30,240
I'll get someone

852
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,192
to deliver all of them
to Duke Ying's Residence.

853
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,961
Mingzhu is joking.

854
00:40:34,961 --> 00:40:36,280
How can we bring them all away?

855
00:40:36,304 --> 00:40:37,360
There are so many flowers.

856
00:40:37,696 --> 00:40:38,928
No need to take it seriously.

857
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:40,521
These flowers

858
00:40:40,921 --> 00:40:41,841
were rare species

859
00:40:41,841 --> 00:40:44,001
chosen by Uncle from all over the place.

860
00:40:44,441 --> 00:40:45,841
Mingzhu, you should pick the flowers.

861
00:40:46,921 --> 00:40:48,481
My eyes are blurred from choosing.

862
00:40:48,521 --> 00:40:49,881
Let's take a break.

863
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,441
I should be punished. Please forgive me.

864
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,720
What are you doing?

865
00:40:56,921 --> 00:40:58,680
Bring Young Lady Yining
to clean herself.

866
00:40:59,361 --> 00:41:00,401
Please forgive us.

867
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,521
It's all right.

868
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,600
Young Lady, please come with me.

869
00:41:08,736 --> 00:41:10,840
The maids from your residence
have always been careful.

870
00:41:10,961 --> 00:41:12,560
When did they become so careless?

871
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,921
My uncle still remembers

872
00:41:15,401 --> 00:41:17,160
how you helped him twice,
Young Lady Mingzhu.

873
00:41:19,001 --> 00:41:20,640
What is Godbrother trying to do?

874
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,560
Well...

875
00:41:23,936 --> 00:41:25,640
It's better if you don't ask about this.

876
00:42:16,032 --> 00:42:17,584
You don't know how to make clay dolls.

877
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,001
I like clay dolls the most.

878
00:42:19,041 --> 00:42:19,881
I told you

879
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:21,280
I can learn.

880
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,441
It is difficult to make clay dolls.

881
00:42:24,001 --> 00:42:25,720
I will definitely learn how to make it

882
00:42:25,872 --> 00:42:27,280
as long as I get a glimpse of one.

883
00:42:35,961 --> 00:42:36,401
Mei.

884
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:41,841
Lu Jiaxue?

885
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:47,560
This is...

886
00:42:50,441 --> 00:42:51,240
Back then,

887
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:54,160
when I prepared a bridal chamber

888
00:42:54,841 --> 00:42:56,280
to marry you,

889
00:42:56,841 --> 00:42:58,361
I realized you were forced

890
00:42:58,361 --> 00:43:00,120
to jump down a cliff by Song Ziyun.

891
00:43:00,481 --> 00:43:01,640
After all these years,

892
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,560
you've finally returned.

893
00:43:04,841 --> 00:43:06,560
You said you didn't like
to study or write.

894
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,280
There isn't a calligraphy paper

895
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:09,760
or book here.

896
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,401
Look.

897
00:43:13,328 --> 00:43:14,704
These papercutting art pieces.

898
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:16,600
Here.

899
00:43:18,361 --> 00:43:19,160
All these

900
00:43:20,321 --> 00:43:21,481
have been prepared by you.

901
00:43:22,481 --> 00:43:23,600
I made

902
00:43:23,881 --> 00:43:25,080
all these clay dolls myself.

903
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:26,361
I told you.

904
00:43:26,416 --> 00:43:27,712
As long as you like something,

905
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,841
nothing is too difficult for me.

906
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:42,080
Also,

907
00:43:44,521 --> 00:43:45,481
this bracelet.

908
00:43:45,856 --> 00:43:47,168
