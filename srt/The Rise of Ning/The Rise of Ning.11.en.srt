(Adapted from Wen Tan's novel "Chancellor
Training Handbook" from Jinjiang Literature)

00:01:36,673 --> 00:01:38,610
=Episode 11=

4
00:01:41,877 --> 00:01:42,917
Chengzhang,

5
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:44,880
come here.

6
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:01,458
In front of the ancestral tablets,

7
00:02:03,116 --> 00:02:04,157
you need to

8
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:07,239
put an end to this matter.

9
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,800
As the head of Luo's Residence,

10
00:02:16,316 --> 00:02:18,237
for the sake of its reputation

11
00:02:18,262 --> 00:02:19,942
and dignity,

12
00:02:20,476 --> 00:02:22,117
give your verdict.

13
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:35,577
Come.

14
00:02:36,796 --> 00:02:38,636
Take Qiao Yuechan away.

15
00:02:38,717 --> 00:02:41,277
She will be punished with fifty lashes
and sent to the farm.

16
00:02:44,076 --> 00:02:45,397
No, Father!

17
00:02:45,516 --> 00:02:46,557
Mother is weak.

18
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,464
I'm willing to take
the fifty lashes for her.

19
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:50,024
Please spare Mother, Father.

20
00:02:50,157 --> 00:02:52,316
Father, even though
Mother has done wrong,

21
00:02:52,341 --> 00:02:53,741
she doesn't deserve this punishment.

22
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:55,470
Please show mercy, Father.

23
00:02:56,665 --> 00:02:57,904
Don't plead with them.

24
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,080
Get up.

25
00:03:02,872 --> 00:03:03,752
Lian, dear.

26
00:03:04,825 --> 00:03:05,705
Xuan, dear.

27
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,319
Lian, take good care of Xuan.

28
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:10,289
Xuan, study well.

29
00:03:11,033 --> 00:03:12,113
Take her away!

30
00:03:12,516 --> 00:03:13,277
Get off!

31
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,240
I can walk myself.

32
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,200
Mother!

33
00:03:24,437 --> 00:03:25,516
Mother!

34
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,117
Mother!

35
00:03:36,142 --> 00:03:37,822
Don't halt me.

36
00:03:43,137 --> 00:03:44,137
Mother!

37
00:03:45,437 --> 00:03:47,277
Are you all right, Mother?

38
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,984
(Jimo House)
What's the hurry?

39
00:03:55,984 --> 00:03:57,490
You look as if you are hiding something.

40
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,960
Sixth Uncle, please come with me.

41
00:04:08,635 --> 00:04:09,874
How did he get hurt?

42
00:04:10,036 --> 00:04:10,837
Sixth Uncle,

43
00:04:10,864 --> 00:04:12,448
I heard you are good
at concocting herbs.

44
00:04:12,448 --> 00:04:14,384
Do you have any effective medicine
for curing wounds?

45
00:04:14,727 --> 00:04:16,566
I don't have a ready-made medicine.

46
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,608
Tell me any herbs you need.
I will get them for you.

47
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,760
Even if you get the herbs,

48
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:22,369
the concocting process takes time.

49
00:04:23,002 --> 00:04:24,761
Can you please think of something

50
00:04:24,784 --> 00:04:26,368
to regain Young Master's consciousness?

51
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,479
You are awake, Young Master.

52
00:04:44,002 --> 00:04:45,641
This is my secret wound pill.

53
00:04:46,325 --> 00:04:47,565
One pill is worth a lot.

54
00:04:49,201 --> 00:04:50,002
Uncle,

55
00:04:52,162 --> 00:04:53,802
Shao'an will

56
00:04:54,602 --> 00:04:55,682
pay you the money later.

57
00:04:56,881 --> 00:04:58,201
Uncle,

58
00:04:59,002 --> 00:05:00,602
please don't let anyone know

59
00:05:01,562 --> 00:05:02,401
what you saw now.

60
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:04,841
I have no idea
why you have knife wounds,

61
00:05:05,295 --> 00:05:06,295
but I think

62
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,520
you are not a bad person

63
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,081
despite your unkind face.

64
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,560
No worries.

65
00:05:10,582 --> 00:05:11,782
I won't tell anyone.

66
00:05:12,362 --> 00:05:13,441
Thank you, Uncle.

67
00:05:13,961 --> 00:05:16,281
You need two months of complete rest
to recover.

68
00:05:16,487 --> 00:05:17,887
Don't strain yourself.

69
00:05:18,081 --> 00:05:19,682
Shao'an, I will write a prescription.

70
00:05:19,682 --> 00:05:20,802
Follow me to get the herbs.

71
00:05:21,482 --> 00:05:23,042
Yes. Thank you so much,
Sixth Master Lin.

(Memorial Tablet of Mother, Gu)

73
00:06:02,602 --> 00:06:03,401
Grandma.

74
00:06:04,726 --> 00:06:06,606
Kneel in front of

75
00:06:07,216 --> 00:06:08,656
your mother's memorial tablet.

76
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,561
Do you know what you did wrong?

77
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:21,224
Grandma,

78
00:06:22,162 --> 00:06:24,042
what I did earlier today

79
00:06:24,042 --> 00:06:25,122
was dangerous,

80
00:06:26,042 --> 00:06:28,201
but I don't think I'm wrong.

81
00:06:28,682 --> 00:06:30,441
Mistress Qiao framed my mother,

82
00:06:30,841 --> 00:06:33,002
ruined her reputation,
and made her devastated.

83
00:06:33,641 --> 00:06:36,002
How am I wrong for exposing her?

84
00:06:36,482 --> 00:06:38,362
Since you don't realize

85
00:06:38,362 --> 00:06:39,722
what you did wrong,

86
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,800
kneel in front of your mother's tablet

87
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,054
until you figure it out.

88
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:46,158
Then, you answer my question.

Shenyuan,

95
00:07:35,682 --> 00:07:37,401
do you also think I'm wrong?

96
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,042
What's the point

97
00:07:44,641 --> 00:07:46,122
of proving your innocence

98
00:07:46,122 --> 00:07:47,401
if something bad happens to you?

99
00:07:48,602 --> 00:07:50,042
Would your late mother be at peace

100
00:07:50,602 --> 00:07:51,602
if she knew this?

101
00:07:53,562 --> 00:07:55,641
You determined to clear
your mother's name.

102
00:07:56,362 --> 00:07:57,722
But no matter how urgent you feel,

103
00:07:57,722 --> 00:07:59,841
you must protect yourself.

104
00:08:01,802 --> 00:08:04,002
You are lucky this time,
but what about next time?

105
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,608
One living in this lifetime

106
00:08:06,881 --> 00:08:08,641
has many goals

107
00:08:08,641 --> 00:08:09,922
to achieve.

108
00:08:10,841 --> 00:08:13,362
If you always act without considering
the consequences,

109
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:16,682
you will end up suffering great losses.

110
00:08:19,682 --> 00:08:20,722
Thank you, Shenyuan,

111
00:08:21,641 --> 00:08:23,482
for helping me all along.

112
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,880
You can say I'm reckless or act

113
00:08:27,904 --> 00:08:29,440
without considering
the consequences,

114
00:08:31,281 --> 00:08:32,881
but I won't regret it.

115
00:08:36,681 --> 00:08:39,842
Every plan is risky
despite how meticulously

116
00:08:40,362 --> 00:08:41,521
you have prepared.

117
00:08:42,161 --> 00:08:43,521
Instead of hesitating,

118
00:08:44,641 --> 00:08:47,322
it's better to seize the right timing

119
00:08:47,442 --> 00:08:48,322
and take a chance.

120
00:09:12,293 --> 00:09:13,094
Yining.

121
00:09:13,781 --> 00:09:14,582
Yining.

122
00:09:20,962 --> 00:09:22,362
What's wrong with Yining?

123
00:09:22,482 --> 00:09:24,482
Old Madam, Seventh Lady
is burning up again.

124
00:09:24,482 --> 00:09:25,641
Summon a physician now.

125
00:09:25,641 --> 00:09:26,362
Madam Lin,

126
00:09:26,362 --> 00:09:27,679
Song Zhi has summoned a physician.

127
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,610
Where's Qing Qu?
Isn't that she knows healing skills?

128
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,790
Seventh Lady asked her to escort

129
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,620
Physician Meng and his family
out of the capital.

130
00:09:32,624 --> 00:09:33,750
She hasn't returned yet.

131
00:09:40,082 --> 00:09:40,881
Old Madam.

132
00:09:46,362 --> 00:09:47,401
You may leave.

133
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,521
The physician will be here soon.

134
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,239
Girl,

135
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,561
why are you so stubborn?

136
00:10:14,842 --> 00:10:15,801
Look at yourself.

137
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,840
You are burning up.

138
00:10:17,862 --> 00:10:19,181
Why didn't you beg for mercy?

139
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:22,002
I'm really worried about you.

140
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,801
- Physician Li, this way.
- All right.

141
00:10:38,401 --> 00:10:39,202
(Remember,)

142
00:10:39,485 --> 00:10:41,285
(don't let her worry)

143
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:42,510
(or get too depressed.)

144
00:10:42,535 --> 00:10:44,774
(Otherwise, the fever won't go down,)

145
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,880
and it may not be easily cured

146
00:10:46,921 --> 00:10:48,561
by common methods.

147
00:10:48,921 --> 00:10:49,962
Physician Du,

148
00:10:51,082 --> 00:10:52,122
if it flares up again,

149
00:10:52,446 --> 00:10:53,885
is there any way to relieve the fever?

150
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:55,122
Yes, there is,

151
00:10:55,242 --> 00:10:56,041
but

152
00:10:56,401 --> 00:10:58,681
it's very risky.

153
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,160
As long as it can relieve her pain.

154
00:11:00,401 --> 00:11:02,521
Please tell me, Physician Du.

155
00:11:08,838 --> 00:11:10,157
How's Seventh Lady?

156
00:11:16,482 --> 00:11:17,281
Mother,

157
00:11:17,681 --> 00:11:19,002
they have used acupuncture

158
00:11:19,002 --> 00:11:20,082
and medicine on Yining,

159
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,744
but her fever still hasn't gone down

160
00:11:21,792 --> 00:11:23,280
after the whole night.

161
00:11:23,281 --> 00:11:24,801
Instead, it's getting serious.

162
00:11:25,161 --> 00:11:26,161
She needs

163
00:11:26,161 --> 00:11:27,281
to sweat.

164
00:11:27,641 --> 00:11:29,122
This blanket isn't enough.

165
00:11:29,561 --> 00:11:30,695
Bring two more blankets.

166
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:31,520
- Hurry.
- Yes.

167
00:11:37,761 --> 00:11:38,559
Give them to me.

168
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,504
Don't use the blankets.

169
00:11:40,442 --> 00:11:41,202
Move.

170
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,136
What are you trying to do?

171
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:44,881
- Shen... Shenyuan.
- Go out.

172
00:11:44,881 --> 00:11:46,801
Bring some ice and liquor here.

173
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,160
The stronger, the better. Go now.

174
00:11:48,161 --> 00:11:48,801
Wait.

175
00:11:48,801 --> 00:11:49,962
What are you doing?

176
00:11:49,962 --> 00:11:51,281
Shenyuan, stop it.

177
00:11:51,281 --> 00:11:52,521
She caught a cold.

178
00:11:52,521 --> 00:11:54,082
Her condition will worsen.

179
00:11:54,082 --> 00:11:55,561
Are you trying to harm her?

180
00:11:55,561 --> 00:11:56,521
If I wanted to harm her,

181
00:11:56,521 --> 00:11:57,921
I'd have left her kneeling there.

182
00:11:57,921 --> 00:11:59,122
Why would I carry her back?

183
00:11:59,122 --> 00:11:59,561
You...

184
00:12:02,082 --> 00:12:03,041
This won't do.

185
00:12:04,442 --> 00:12:04,962

00:12:25,002 --> 00:12:25,881
but they didn't work.

192
00:12:26,082 --> 00:12:27,881
Let Shenyuan try.

193
00:12:28,082 --> 00:12:29,362
Will it work?

194
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:31,144
This is simply nonsense.

195
00:12:34,561 --> 00:12:36,482
Rub the alcohol on her limbs,

196
00:12:36,482 --> 00:12:37,641
chest, and back.

197
00:12:37,641 --> 00:12:38,842
Don't rub the alcohol

198
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:39,921
on the other parts.

199
00:12:39,921 --> 00:12:41,122
Understood? Do it now.

200
00:12:41,362 --> 00:12:42,161
No.

201
00:12:44,962 --> 00:12:46,602
You will harm her.

202
00:12:47,681 --> 00:12:48,482
Old Madam,

203
00:12:48,507 --> 00:12:49,507
can you trust me for once?

204
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:50,688
If anything bad happens to her,

205
00:12:50,704 --> 00:12:51,990
I will pay with my life.

206
00:12:52,202 --> 00:12:54,482
Mother, just let Shenyuan try.

207
00:12:59,482 --> 00:13:00,122
Let's leave.

208
00:13:00,281 --> 00:13:00,801
Hurry up.

209
00:13:01,483 --> 00:13:04,420
♪I will stay in this corner♪

210
00:13:05,136 --> 00:13:07,400
Are you sure the person
who fought with you over the statement

211
00:13:07,681 --> 00:13:08,881
was Li Yinglong?

212
00:13:09,881 --> 00:13:11,801
Your Lordship, I believe so.

213
00:13:11,888 --> 00:13:13,264
I had several fights with him before,

214
00:13:13,312 --> 00:13:14,800
and I saw the same ring.

215
00:13:14,801 --> 00:13:16,442
Besides, their martial moves also match.

216
00:13:16,761 --> 00:13:18,082
Are you sure the burned statement

217
00:13:18,442 --> 00:13:21,002
belongs to Sun Chengwu?

218
00:13:21,962 --> 00:13:24,202
I didn't see that clearly.

219
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,200
But Li Yinglong even risked his life
to protect it,

220
00:13:26,202 --> 00:13:27,122
so I believe it must be.

221
00:13:27,147 --> 00:13:28,267
You believe?

222
00:13:32,475 --> 00:13:34,036
All your answers are uncertain.

223
00:13:34,681 --> 00:13:35,482
However,

224
00:13:36,161 --> 00:13:37,801
it strikes me as odd

225
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:39,482
that a seafarer

226
00:13:39,482 --> 00:13:40,881
like Li Yinglong,

227
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:42,639
who fled to the capital

228
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,904
like a pathetic, homeless dog,

229
00:13:44,161 --> 00:13:45,722
could figure out things that happened

230
00:13:45,842 --> 00:13:47,442
in the Luo Residence
in such a short time.

231
00:13:47,761 --> 00:13:48,722
Uncle, do you suspect

232
00:13:48,881 --> 00:13:50,521
that this is a smokescreen?

233
00:13:51,041 --> 00:13:52,679
But Old Madam Luo was heartbroken

234
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,460
- about Old Master Luo's...
- Have you noticed

235
00:13:54,464 --> 00:13:55,640
anyone suspicious?

236
00:13:58,161 --> 00:14:00,202
Your Lordship,
on the day at Yuanjing Pavilion,

237
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:01,920
Seventh Lady Luo
was being chased by someone.

238
00:14:02,161 --> 00:14:03,962
She was wearing

239
00:14:03,962 --> 00:14:05,122
a pale yellow cloth jacket.

240
00:14:05,401 --> 00:14:06,362
I remember that the woman

241
00:14:06,442 --> 00:14:07,842
rescued by the black-clad person

242
00:14:07,842 --> 00:14:09,641
was also wearing
a pale yellow cloth jacket.

243
00:14:09,868 --> 00:14:11,002
Plus, Seventh Lady mentioned

244
00:14:11,002 --> 00:14:11,801
that she was saved

245
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:13,549
by Third Young Master Luo.

246
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:15,161
The Third Young Master Luo

247
00:14:15,161 --> 00:14:15,962
is very likely

248
00:14:15,962 --> 00:14:17,521
to be related to the black-clad person.

249
00:14:20,161 --> 00:14:21,482
Third Young Master Luo?

250
00:14:23,842 --> 00:14:24,681
Well,

251
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:26,801
lead your men

252
00:14:27,641 --> 00:14:28,761
to investigate the whereabouts

253
00:14:28,761 --> 00:14:30,002
of these two people.

254
00:14:30,602 --> 00:14:31,401
Yes, Your Lordship.

255
00:14:36,602 --> 00:14:37,401
Anything else?

256
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,759
Uncle,

257
00:14:42,801 --> 00:14:44,082
regarding Seventh Lady,

258
00:14:44,881 --> 00:14:46,401
I found something about her.

259
00:14:46,521 --> 00:14:47,842
Why are you hesitating? Shoot.

260
00:14:48,442 --> 00:14:51,962
I saw the paper-cut screen
Seventh Lady gave to

261
00:14:51,962 --> 00:14:53,521
Old Madam.

262
00:14:53,842 --> 00:14:54,842
It was exquisite.

263
00:14:54,842 --> 00:14:56,161
Not just anyone could do it.

264
00:14:56,801 --> 00:14:59,281
I wonder if she's related to the person

265
00:14:59,281 --> 00:15:00,281
you are looking for.

266
00:15:00,842 --> 00:15:03,681
I purposely mentioned your name to her

267
00:15:04,202 --> 00:15:05,722
to test her,

268
00:15:06,362 --> 00:15:07,641
but she didn't give any response.

269
00:15:07,972 --> 00:15:10,252
Perhaps I was overthinking.

270
00:15:15,082 --> 00:15:17,041
Whether she's related to Mei,

271
00:15:17,362 --> 00:15:18,442
Seventh Lady

272
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:20,921
is a person to be reckoned with.

273
00:15:21,362 --> 00:15:23,401
I will find a chance to meet her.

274
00:15:23,521 --> 00:15:24,281
Anything else?

275
00:15:25,002 --> 00:15:25,722
No.

276
00:15:26,082 --> 00:15:26,801
Go on.

277
00:15:28,681 --> 00:15:29,722
I will take my leave, Uncle.

278
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,640
(Haitang Abode)

279
00:16:03,322 --> 00:16:04,521
Young Lady, you are awake.

280
00:16:12,401 --> 00:16:15,122
I think I saw

281
00:16:15,122 --> 00:16:18,801
Grandma, Mother, and Shenyuan.

282
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:20,521
They were staying here for one night

283
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,521
and returned
when your fever finally went down.

284
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:24,281
It was scary last night.

285
00:16:24,362 --> 00:16:26,002
It was just a fever.

286
00:16:27,002 --> 00:16:28,122
You sounded like

287
00:16:28,442 --> 00:16:30,442
I was having a serious illness.

288
00:16:30,482 --> 00:16:32,002
Even though it was just a fever,

289
00:16:32,002 --> 00:16:34,202
the medicine and acupuncture
didn't work for you.

290
00:16:34,281 --> 00:16:35,482
It was the Third Young Master

291
00:16:35,482 --> 00:16:37,521
who used the cooling method
to bring your fever down.

292
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,041
He got scolded badly

293
00:16:39,056 --> 00:16:40,855
by Old Madam last night.

294
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,200
Young Lady,

295
00:16:42,281 --> 00:16:44,161
Old Madam is still angry.

296
00:16:44,161 --> 00:16:45,681
She said once you recover,

297
00:16:45,696 --> 00:16:47,712
you need to go to Muxi Hall
to receive your punishment.

298
00:16:49,082 --> 00:16:50,082
All right.

299
00:16:51,561 --> 00:16:53,681
Tell Song Zhi to bring some food.

300
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:55,442
You help me dress up.

301
00:16:55,442 --> 00:16:56,442
I'm heading over later.

302
00:16:56,442 --> 00:16:58,082
Young Lady, you just recovered.

303
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,559
Old Madam said
it's when you are fully recovered.

304
00:17:02,281 --> 00:17:04,642
Don't worry. I'm good.

305
00:17:04,962 --> 00:17:06,041
Grandma may appear

306
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,402
to be angry with me,

307
00:17:07,761 --> 00:17:09,841
but she cares a lot about me.

308
00:17:10,743 --> 00:17:11,743
Therefore,

309
00:17:11,882 --> 00:17:13,321
I have to receive my punishment.

310
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,521
It's my fault

311
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:18,202
to annoy her this time.

312
00:17:25,882 --> 00:17:26,722
Old Madam.

313
00:17:28,442 --> 00:17:29,841
How's she? Is she awake?

314
00:17:29,888 --> 00:17:30,672
Yes.

315
00:17:30,704 --> 00:17:32,400
She's eaten congee
and taken the medicine.

316
00:17:32,402 --> 00:17:33,761
I believe she is all right.

317
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:34,922
Please don't worry, Old Madam.

318
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:39,682
Why don't you check on her?

319
00:17:40,002 --> 00:17:40,801
I'm not going.

320
00:17:41,321 --> 00:17:42,682
If I do,

321
00:17:43,397 --> 00:17:44,718
she won't cherish herself

322
00:17:44,743 --> 00:17:46,142
and repeat the mistake in the future.

323
00:17:46,801 --> 00:17:47,601
I won't go.

324
00:17:51,962 --> 00:17:53,882
Why did you come here, Seventh Lady?

325
00:17:53,962 --> 00:17:55,841
Old Madam was
just talking about you.

326
00:17:56,361 --> 00:17:57,121
Greetings, Grandma.

327
00:18:00,922 --> 00:18:01,722
Grandma.

328
00:18:05,002 --> 00:18:06,041
Grandma.

329
00:18:07,402 --> 00:18:09,202
I was down with a fever
all night last night

330
00:18:09,361 --> 00:18:11,121
and knelt for hours.

331
00:18:11,841 --> 00:18:13,682
Please don't be mad at me.

332
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,241
Grandma.

333
00:18:21,121 --> 00:18:22,361
Grandma.

334
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,440
Ow, my head hurts.

335
00:18:30,682 --> 00:18:32,841
My fever hasn't gone down yet?

336
00:18:33,841 --> 00:18:35,281
What if my brain is hurt

337
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:36,361
by the fever?

338
00:18:43,601 --> 00:18:45,321
If you really become silly,

339
00:18:45,841 --> 00:18:48,202
I won't have to worry
so much about you.

340
00:18:48,682 --> 00:18:50,002
I'm not silly.

341
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:51,682
I'm your sweetheart.

342
00:18:51,682 --> 00:18:52,882
How could I be silly?

343
00:18:53,281 --> 00:18:54,682
As long as you don't upset me,

344
00:18:54,682 --> 00:18:56,521
you are my good girl.

345
00:19:00,442 --> 00:19:01,202
Grandma,

346
00:19:01,606 --> 00:19:03,406
your eyes are so beautiful.

347
00:19:04,321 --> 00:19:05,801
I must've taken that after you,

348
00:19:06,002 --> 00:19:07,202
that's why I'm pretty.

349
00:19:07,329 --> 00:19:08,888
Are you complimenting me

350
00:19:08,888 --> 00:19:10,168
or yourself?

351
00:19:10,168 --> 00:19:12,408
My eyes were closed.

352
00:19:12,946 --> 00:19:14,385
Even if you close your eyes,

353
00:19:14,610 --> 00:19:15,651
your mind

354
00:19:15,676 --> 00:19:17,115
is clearer than anyone else's.

355
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:18,648
Even clearer than the sky.

356
00:19:19,809 --> 00:19:21,968
My mind is clearer than the sky?

357
00:19:24,129 --> 00:19:24,968
Girl,

358
00:19:25,208 --> 00:19:26,728
you are not fooling me

359
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,881
with your flattery.

360
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,760
Tell me.

361
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:32,448
Why didn't you rest more

362
00:19:32,488 --> 00:19:34,049
after the fever was down?

363
00:19:36,129 --> 00:19:39,169
Grandma, it's my fault.

364
00:19:39,809 --> 00:19:42,129
I'm here to apologize.

365
00:19:42,169 --> 00:19:43,770
Then tell me, what have you done?

366
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:48,529
I shouldn't have made you worry.

367
00:19:55,981 --> 00:19:56,981
Ning,

368
00:19:58,826 --> 00:20:00,906
you are a good girl.

369
00:20:04,441 --> 00:20:05,722
Over the years,

370
00:20:06,769 --> 00:20:08,448
there has been one thing

371
00:20:09,329 --> 00:20:11,769
bothering me.

372
00:20:12,688 --> 00:20:15,289
If I hadn't gone

373
00:20:15,755 --> 00:20:19,676
to propose a marriage to your mother,

374
00:20:20,728 --> 00:20:21,648
perhaps

375
00:20:21,995 --> 00:20:23,074
she would still

376
00:20:23,099 --> 00:20:24,899
be alive.

377
00:20:25,688 --> 00:20:26,488
Grandma,

378
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:28,970
you can't blame yourself for that.

379
00:20:29,289 --> 00:20:30,569
But I

380
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:34,208
have been living with guilt.

381
00:20:35,746 --> 00:20:37,226
Before your mother's passing,

382
00:20:37,251 --> 00:20:38,731
she entrusted you to me.

383
00:20:38,928 --> 00:20:40,049
I thought to myself

384
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:41,728
that I must keep you safe

385
00:20:42,347 --> 00:20:45,347
in this life.

386
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,040
But now you went to investigate

387
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,599
Mistress Qiao

388
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,879
all by yourself.

389
00:20:56,079 --> 00:20:57,399
What if

390
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,920
she tries to harm you?

391
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:02,520
How am I going to carry on without you?

392
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:03,480
Grandma,

393
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,440
to be honest,

394
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,760
I wasn't alone this time.

395
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,799
Shenyuan

396
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,159
was backing me up.

397
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:13,720
What does this

398
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,319
have to do with him?

399
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:16,720
Actually,

400
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,480
Shenyuan is a nice person.

401
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:20,960
Did you see the hairpin here?

402
00:21:21,399 --> 00:21:24,200
My mother wanted to give it to me.

403
00:21:24,319 --> 00:21:26,839
He retrieved it back from Mistress Qiao.

404
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:27,960
You see,

405
00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:30,680
you have been talking about him.

406
00:21:31,119 --> 00:21:32,879
It seems he has helped you a lot.

407
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,639
Be honest with me.

408
00:21:35,639 --> 00:21:37,119
When did you become

409
00:21:37,553 --> 00:21:39,553
so close with this brother?

410
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:42,839
Grandma,

411
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,200
honestly, I have recalled

412
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,960
a lot of childhood memories lately.

413
00:21:48,594 --> 00:21:51,354
I used to bully him when I was a kid,

414
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,480
but he was never mad at me.

415
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,079
Besides, sometimes,

416
00:21:57,079 --> 00:21:59,200
I think we share the same problems

417
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,879
as we were both despised by Father

418
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:03,399
because of our mothers.

419
00:22:06,851 --> 00:22:09,000
Fortunately, I have you

420
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,879
and Mother,

421
00:22:10,599 --> 00:22:13,639
but Shenyuan isn't as lucky as I am.

422
00:22:25,879 --> 00:22:26,720
Take it away.

423
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:30,975
Madam Lin.

424
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,520
The two chests have been checked.

425
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:33,552
Bring those two chests

426
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,920
of clothes and shoes to her abode.

427
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:37,359
Yes. Carry these two chests away.

428
00:22:37,386 --> 00:22:37,825
Yes.

429
00:23:07,639 --> 00:23:08,440
Take them away.

430
00:23:09,599 --> 00:23:10,720
Hold on.

431
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,520
Hold on.

432
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,599
Madam Lin,

433
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:19,081
this bracelet was brought

434
00:23:19,095 --> 00:23:20,854
from my mother's maiden family.

435
00:23:21,141 --> 00:23:22,141
You can't take it away.

436
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:25,159
Are you aware of
how much this bracelet is worth?

437
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,159
I doubt she could afford
such a fine thing

438
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:29,601
before marrying into here.

439
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,839
Perhaps Father

440
00:23:32,839 --> 00:23:34,159
gave it to her.

441
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,760
Very well.

442
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:39,000
We can ask your father

443
00:23:39,079 --> 00:23:40,680
if he bought it.

444
00:23:42,639 --> 00:23:45,040
It's written in black and white

445
00:23:45,065 --> 00:23:46,745
on your mother's private accounts.

446
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:48,680
She sold off Madam Gu's dowry,

447
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,599
including screens, clothes, accessories,

448
00:23:50,599 --> 00:23:52,000
and even shoes.

449
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,100
They are 800 guans altogether.

450
00:23:53,104 --> 00:23:54,870
She didn't sell this bracelet

451
00:23:54,879 --> 00:23:55,960
because it was too valuable.

452
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,879
This is impossible.

453
00:24:00,879 --> 00:24:03,159
All of these should've belonged
to Yining,

454
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:05,240
but your mother sold all of them off.

455
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,240
None of them can be reclaimed now,

456
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,920
and most of the money has been spent.

457
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,680
If you want to keep this,

458
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:13,040
how will you compensate Yining?

459
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,480
Also,

460
00:24:19,159 --> 00:24:21,720
she has been managing
the household all these years

461
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,040
and left it with a large deficit.

462
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:26,879
However, she has bought
a lot of properties for herself.

463
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,319
Where did that money come from?

464
00:24:30,399 --> 00:24:31,760
My mother

465
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:33,159
scrimped and saved...

466
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:33,839
As if!

467
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:37,200
Her monthly allowance was fixed.

468
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,610
There's no way she could've saved
that amount in ten lifetimes.

469
00:24:39,616 --> 00:24:41,830
Do you not know

470
00:24:41,839 --> 00:24:43,200
how much she embezzled?

471
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,599
Madam Lin, please show mercy.

472
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:47,344
After all, the people
in the Bilian Pavilion

473
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,000
still have to carry on.

474
00:24:49,626 --> 00:24:51,745
Xuan... Xuan is about to

475
00:24:51,770 --> 00:24:53,330
sit for the autumn examination.

476
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,480
You can't mistreat him, right?

477
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,680
Bilian Pavilion
has everything it deserves.

478
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,799
You have a full set

479
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:00,920
of tables, chairs, screens,

480
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,240
beds, and clothing chests.

481
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,599
We didn't take a single piece

482
00:25:03,599 --> 00:25:05,480
of your clothes or shoes allocated
based on the standards.

483
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,839
Did I not provide you with food,

484
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,149
clothing, or a place to sleep?

485
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:09,840
Why do you accuse me
of mistreating him?

486
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:11,879
Young Lady.

487
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:12,760
Young Lady.

488
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,040
Pretending to faint again?

489
00:25:16,112 --> 00:25:17,920
I'm telling you,
your tricks don't work on me.

490
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:19,520
If you can't accept this,

491
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:20,520
we can bring it

492
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:21,639
before the public

493
00:25:21,639 --> 00:25:22,960
and let them judge.

494
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,839
If not, stop complaining

495
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:26,720
that I'm not understanding.

496
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,159
Take the rest away and make space

497
00:25:30,321 --> 00:25:31,281
for the Fifth Lady

498
00:25:31,306 --> 00:25:32,147
to lie down.

499
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,319
Yes, Madam Lin.

500
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,800
Young Lady, don't be too upset.

501
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,359
Perhaps Second Master
was just angry.

502
00:26:00,639 --> 00:26:02,359
He cares for you very much.

503
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,760
He will forgive you very soon.

504
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,119
You don't understand.

505
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,359
It's different this time.

506
00:26:09,599 --> 00:26:10,639
Father even asks me

507
00:26:10,639 --> 00:26:13,119
to follow Madam Lin's teachings.

508
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,839
He isn't like this before.

509
00:26:16,639 --> 00:26:18,359
How am I going to survive in the future?

510
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,612
Why are you doing embroidery here alone,

511
00:26:31,637 --> 00:26:33,157
Yiyu?

512
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,879
Yilian, did you just cry?

513
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,399
Your eyes are red.

514
00:26:40,464 --> 00:26:42,000
First Lady, you may not know about this.

515
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,520
Young Lady has been bullied lately.

516
00:26:44,639 --> 00:26:45,920
She has been crying all day.

517
00:26:46,014 --> 00:26:47,253
Ying, enough.

518
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,839
At this point,

519
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:52,040
I can't blame anyone.

520
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:53,639
It's just that

521
00:26:54,839 --> 00:26:57,359
I'm lost about my future.

522
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,960
Yilian, don't worry too much

523
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,760
and play fewer tricks.

524
00:27:07,264 --> 00:27:08,680
That way, you wouldn't have suffered

525
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,799
from your own doings.

526
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:13,359
What do you mean, Yiyu?

527
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:15,839
Have you heard any rumors?

528
00:27:16,238 --> 00:27:17,680
I honestly don't know

529
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,399
what my mother did.

530
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:21,920
Luo Yilian,

531
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,200
do you think I'm a fool?

532
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,159
I have treated you more sincerely

533
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:27,799
than Luo Yixiu,

534
00:27:28,156 --> 00:27:29,237
yet you treated me as a tool

535
00:27:29,262 --> 00:27:30,742
to get rid of Luo Yining all along.

536
00:27:30,879 --> 00:27:32,200
That's not true, Yiyu.

537
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:33,599
I didn't.

538
00:27:35,079 --> 00:27:36,920
You convinced me
to send a poem to Cheng Lang,

539
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,830
tricked me into picking
the silk waistband,

540
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,760
and lied to me

541
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:42,319
about how Luo Yining and her mother

542
00:27:42,319 --> 00:27:43,839
endangered you and your mother.

543
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,559
How dare you deny

544
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:47,680
that this wasn't your
and your mother's scheme?

545
00:27:47,879 --> 00:27:49,119
I noticed

546
00:27:49,119 --> 00:27:50,799
you liked Cheng Lang

547
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,079
and that Yining stole Grandma's
attention from you.

548
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:54,359
I couldn't tolerate it,

549
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:55,839
so I helped you.

550
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:57,720
As for the silk waistband...

551
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,000
You lied.

552
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:05,680
You lied that you didn't know

553
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,119
how many petals it had.

554
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,096
I'm not like you.

555
00:28:13,121 --> 00:28:14,762
Always trying to frame others.

556
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,060
I didn't remember

557
00:28:17,085 --> 00:28:18,684
how many petals it had.

558
00:28:20,639 --> 00:28:21,159
Why?

559
00:28:22,639 --> 00:28:24,599
Have you given up
on pretending to be innocent?

560
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,040
This time,

561
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,760
I should thank you, Yiyu.

562
00:28:42,599 --> 00:28:43,559
Don't get me wrong.

563
00:28:43,568 --> 00:28:45,720
I didn't want to get involved
in your family matters.

564
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,415
I was just telling

565
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,561
what I knew.

566
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:51,574
You secretly sent someone

567
00:28:51,599 --> 00:28:52,720
to give me a note

568
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:54,359
to remind me about the silk waistband.

569
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:55,799
How do you explain that?

570
00:28:58,159 --> 00:28:59,200
I recognized

571
00:28:59,399 --> 00:29:00,599
your handwriting.

572
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,799
Enough said.

573
00:29:04,319 --> 00:29:07,041
You helped me cover up
the flower buds incident last time,

574
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,879
so I returned your favor.

575
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,480
We are even now.

576
00:29:11,639 --> 00:29:12,960
Don't bring this up again.

577
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,000
Of course.

578
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,280
But

579
00:29:19,159 --> 00:29:21,440
how did you know
about another silk waistband?

580
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,559
On the day of the fire,

581
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:27,399
I snuck into Bilian Pavilion.

582
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:32,879
You might think I'm not a simple person,

583
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:35,000
but I have suffered too much

584
00:29:35,079 --> 00:29:36,680
to remain naive.

585
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,520
Father,

586
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:01,240
I was about to come find you.

587
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:02,159
Yining,

588
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:03,920
I was told you were sick again.

589
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,401
Are you feeling better?

590
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,040
Thank you for your concern, Father.

591
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,639
I'm a lot better.

592
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:11,879
You came here

593
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,680
for your mother, right?

594
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,520
I know

595
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:19,960
you value the reputation
of the Luo's Residence,

596
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,119
so you won't send Mistress Qiao
to yamen.

597
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:24,480
Hence,

598
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:26,599
I won't force you either.

599
00:30:27,639 --> 00:30:28,520
Over the years,

600
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,520
it has been tough for you.

601
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,839
I was wrong about you.

602
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,960
As long as you

603
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:38,760
clear my mother's name,

604
00:30:39,159 --> 00:30:40,440
I don't mind that.

605
00:30:41,559 --> 00:30:42,839
Father, I implore you

606
00:30:43,119 --> 00:30:44,200
to open the Ancestral Shrine

607
00:30:44,879 --> 00:30:46,920
and announce that my mother is innocent.

608
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:49,480
Of course.

609
00:30:50,319 --> 00:30:52,559
Now that I know
your mother was innocent,

610
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:53,799
I will

611
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:55,680
restore justice to her name.

612
00:30:56,359 --> 00:30:57,520
Do take care of your body,

613
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,240
and don't worry about other things.

614
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:01,599
Xue Zhi,

615
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,319
help her return to rest.

616
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:03,960
Yes.

617
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:05,680
Young Lady, let's return.

618
00:31:06,879 --> 00:31:08,000
Thank you, Father.

619
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:17,032
(Caifu Abode)

620
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:19,680
He can't catch a cold.

621
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:20,359
Yes.

622
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:21,839
Sixth Master Lin,

623
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,079
should we return to Jimo House
to continue the treatment?

624
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,120
Don't worry.

625
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,200
My sister is handling

626
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,480
Bilian Pavilion's accounts.

627
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,000
She will be there

628
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,760
until all lights are off.

629
00:31:31,159 --> 00:31:32,599
You can rest easy here.

630
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:34,040
It's convenient for me
to fetch the herbs.

631
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:34,839
All right.

632
00:31:35,639 --> 00:31:36,680
You are strange, though.

633
00:31:36,839 --> 00:31:38,599
Haven't you been resting well?

634
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:40,520
The wound should've healed by now,

635
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,552
why did it tear open again?

636
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:44,680
I was moving some pots,

637
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,960
and the wound split.

638
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:47,639
I didn't mean to interfere,

639
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,119
but stop doing heavy work
like a gardener.

640
00:31:50,176 --> 00:31:51,790
If you want the wound
to heal completely,

641
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,960
you need to rest.

642
00:31:53,839 --> 00:31:54,520
All right.

643
00:31:57,472 --> 00:31:59,552
We are relatives,
so let's keep this strictly business.

644
00:32:07,879 --> 00:32:09,440
All right. If anything happens,

645
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,879
send Shao'an to me.

646
00:32:10,879 --> 00:32:13,639
I'm willing to help.

647
00:32:13,639 --> 00:32:14,359
All right.

648
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:15,359
Uncle,

649
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,119
I do have a favor to ask.

650
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,760
Sixth Uncle,

651
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,520
you brought so many medicines.

652
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:25,359
I have already taken a lot.

653
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,720
Besides, Mother

654
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,359
also sent me more today.

655
00:32:28,359 --> 00:32:29,879
I can't finish all of them.

656
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:31,399
Yet you sent even much more.

657
00:32:31,639 --> 00:32:33,000
Are you trying to drown me in it?

658
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,249
You have just recovered,

659
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:35,760
and the cold still lingers in your body.

660
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,840
You need to be careful.

661
00:32:36,879 --> 00:32:38,720
The ones I sent are
high-quality medicines

662
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,920
that are hard to come by.

663
00:32:41,639 --> 00:32:44,119
These seem expensive.

664
00:32:44,787 --> 00:32:46,226
Didn't you say you had no money?

665
00:32:49,359 --> 00:32:50,559
No matter how poor I am,

666
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,640
I can't let you suffer.

667
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,399
I would sell anything if I had to.

668
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:56,399
You shouldn't spend so much
on me anymore.

669
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:57,359
Drink it.

670
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,399
I assure you it's not bitter.

671
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,589
Most importantly,

672
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:04,272
it's the person
who sent these medicines...

673
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,480
This tonic is bitter.

674
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:09,000
- Don't drink it.
- Sixth Uncle,

675
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:11,104
Madam Lin have someone send over

676
00:33:11,136 --> 00:33:12,830
this Mongolian milkvetch
and peony tonic.

677
00:33:12,837 --> 00:33:14,440
It's not good to take too many tonics.

678
00:33:14,608 --> 00:33:15,960
You can water the plants with it.

679
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:17,760
Sixth Uncle...

680
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,839
Those are Young Lady's
favorite hardy begonias.

681
00:33:19,839 --> 00:33:21,520
You might kill them.

682
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,119
Don't worry.

683
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,559
Mongolian milkvetch and peony tonic

684
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,799
have mild properties.

685
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,159
They won't harm the plants.

686
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,799
Instead, they will grow much better.

687
00:33:33,608 --> 00:33:35,088
I will leave you to rest.

688
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,480
By the way, drip this Dan dew

689
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,359
into your tea.
It's good for your health.

690
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:40,839
I'm leaving.

691
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:42,799
Thank you, Sixth Uncle.

692
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,319
Young Lady,

693
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,159
the Sixth Master Lin is interesting.

694
00:33:47,328 --> 00:33:48,688
He suddenly brought those medicines

695
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,559
and then watered the flowers
with your tonic.

696
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:00,639
Why doesn't Shenyuan want her to know
that he gave her those?

697
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,040
Did they fight?

698
00:34:04,359 --> 00:34:06,440
My nephew and niece are indeed childish.

699
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,599
By the way, where did he
get those medicines?

700
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:14,719
Senior Xia Yong finally resolved

701
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,559
the ledger Li Yinglong left,

702
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:18,679
but he said it's only half of it.

703
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,119
How can it only be half?

704
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,559
Where's the other half?

705
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,000
Perhaps it's with

706
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,759
one of his accomplices.

707
00:34:27,759 --> 00:34:30,719
Aren't they all dead?

708
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:33,719
Young Master, I will send Qi An
to investigate

709
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:34,840
if any of his accomplices

710
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,040
have family members.

711
00:34:36,384 --> 00:34:37,430
By the way, Young Master,

712
00:34:37,488 --> 00:34:39,440
Qi An mentioned in the letter
that Lu Jiaxue's men

713
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,240
were asking about
where you and Seventh Lady were

714
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:42,640
during the banquet that night.

715
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,000
Our people said they didn't see you both

716
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,320
as you instructed.

717
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,679
He suddenly investigated
our whereabouts.

718
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:56,440
Ye Yan must've heard of something

719
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,400
at the side yard that day.

720
00:35:00,559 --> 00:35:01,759
Will he start

721
00:35:01,759 --> 00:35:02,800
to suspect you?

722
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,159
Don't worry.

723
00:35:07,759 --> 00:35:09,520
We will see what they do next

724
00:35:09,719 --> 00:35:10,599
and act accordingly.

725
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:12,000
Shenyuan.

726
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:15,800
Shenyuan,

727
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:18,440
Xue Zhi told me

728
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,679
you were staying with me
when I was sick that night.

729
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:23,119
You even said
if something happened to me,

730
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,440
you would die with me.

731
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,280
Shenyuan,

732
00:35:30,426 --> 00:35:32,214
aside from Grandma and Mother,

733
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:34,159
you are now
the most important person to me.

734
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:41,759
What's wrong with me?

735
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:44,800
My head hurts again.

736
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:47,759
Do you think

737
00:35:47,759 --> 00:35:48,960
I'm having a fever again?

738
00:35:50,679 --> 00:35:51,920
No, you are perfectly fine.

739
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,679
You are not a physician,

740
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:55,159
how did you know?

741
00:35:56,239 --> 00:35:57,840
You have the mood to smooth talk,

742
00:35:58,440 --> 00:35:59,800
surely, you are fine.

743
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,679
Isn't this Dan dew
from Hundred Herb Apothecary?

744
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:06,079
Sixth Uncle gave me one, too.

745
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,360
Is this from him as well?

746
00:36:12,159 --> 00:36:14,159
Right. He told me

747
00:36:15,079 --> 00:36:16,079
to drip

748
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,360
a few drops of Dan dew
into the tea every day.

749
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,400
It helps replenish qi.

750
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,400
Mother and Grandma

751
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,159
have given me plenty of tonics lately.

752
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:25,320
I can ask Xue Zhi

753
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,360
to give you my Dan dew.

754
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,040
No.

755
00:36:28,759 --> 00:36:30,480
You can skip other tonics,

756
00:36:31,024 --> 00:36:32,832
but you must add a few drops of Dan dew

757
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:35,119
to your tea every day.

758
00:36:40,649 --> 00:36:41,449
Shenyuan,

759
00:36:42,199 --> 00:36:43,199
are you

760
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:44,960
not angry with me anymore?

761
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,759
Well, you...

762
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,159
Promise me

763
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:56,520
you won't take risks anymore.

764
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,639
All right. I promise.

765
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:00,639
I assure you

766
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,239
that no matter what I do,

767
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,000
I will keep myself safe.

768
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,119
Drink it.

769
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,199
Put it back.

770
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,440
Right away.

771
00:37:36,276 --> 00:37:37,117
Shenyuan,

772
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,119
ambergris is precious.

773
00:37:39,559 --> 00:37:41,759
Where did you get so much money?

774
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,599
I'm running a small business
and have made some money.

775
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:46,639
What business?

776
00:37:48,239 --> 00:37:49,920
Just some small trades.

777
00:37:50,448 --> 00:37:52,304
Otherwise, how am I
going to make a living?

778
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:01,520
What's that?

779
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,440
Young Master, don't worry. It's a cat.

780
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:13,360
It's all right.

781
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:14,679
Let's go.

782
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,479
Mother.

783
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,079
When did you arrive, Mother?

784
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:31,159
I went to Caifu Abode
to pay you respects a few days ago,

785
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,120
but you weren't there.

786
00:38:32,239 --> 00:38:32,759
Have a seat.

787
00:38:33,696 --> 00:38:35,280
You must've been waiting
for a long time.

788
00:38:35,376 --> 00:38:37,630
I should've sent Qing Qu to inform you.

789
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,520
It's all right. I have been

790
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:41,424
checking through the Bilian Pavilions
these days.

791
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,800
I discovered quite a few
of Mistress Qiao's private accounts.

792
00:38:43,808 --> 00:38:45,000
It's finally done,

793
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,679
so I took a break

794
00:38:46,679 --> 00:38:47,639
while waiting for you.

795
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,190
Greetings, Madam Lin.

796
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:51,880
Yining,

797
00:38:52,199 --> 00:38:54,679
these are Madam Gu's dowry

798
00:38:54,679 --> 00:38:56,639
that Mistress Qiao secretly sold off.

799
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,239
I tried to get them back.

800
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:01,920
Unfortunately, it was too long ago.

801
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:04,000
I could only retrieve
a few sets of jewelry.

802
00:39:04,679 --> 00:39:07,000
She used the money
to buy properties.

803
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,119
I have already sold them off.

804
00:39:08,159 --> 00:39:10,360
Here's the money for you.

805
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,400
Thank you so much, Mother.

806
00:39:14,759 --> 00:39:15,759
It has been years.

807
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,159
You must've gone above and beyond

808
00:39:17,762 --> 00:39:19,282
to get these back.

809
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:20,920
Silly girl,

810
00:39:21,079 --> 00:39:23,800
this is the least I could do.

811
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,400
Anyway,

812
00:39:25,679 --> 00:39:27,920
they are only keepsakes.

813
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:30,520
What Madam Gu truly wanted

814
00:39:30,544 --> 00:39:31,840
was for you to live a good life.

815
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:37,520
All right. I can rest easy now

816
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,736
after handing them over to you.

817
00:39:38,768 --> 00:39:40,040
I'm going to show your father

818
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,360
these private accounts

819
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,840
so he will know

820
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,480
what Mistress Qiao, whom he trusts,

821
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,520
has been doing all these years.

822
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:49,360
I believe

823
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,679
Father knows about it,

824
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,920
he just turned a blind eye to it.

825
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,679
Mother, let me walk you out.

826
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:56,440
No need.

827
00:39:57,079 --> 00:39:57,880
Shenyuan,

828
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,079
they are making new clothes.

829
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:01,759
I have sent you a few sets.

830
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:02,840
Try them on.

831
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,480
Tell me if they don't fit.

832
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:08,639
If you need anything,
feel free to tell me.

833
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:10,159
You are a good lad.

834
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,639
Thank you, Madam Lin.

835
00:40:30,581 --> 00:40:31,768
(Muxi Hall)

836
00:40:48,639 --> 00:40:50,480
Oh, girl.

837
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:52,480
Just focus on eating.

838
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,320
Why are you staring at me?

839
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:56,800
Because you are beautiful.

840
00:40:57,159 --> 00:41:00,079
My grandma is the prettiest woman
in the capital.

841
00:41:01,853 --> 00:41:04,094
Prettiest woman?

842
00:41:04,559 --> 00:41:06,199
Naughty girl.

843
00:41:07,279 --> 00:41:08,800
You are a smooth talker.

844
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,360
Old Madam.

845
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,456
Madam Lin sends

846
00:41:15,504 --> 00:41:17,520
the Mongolian milkvetch and peony tonic.

847
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:19,480
She said I must watch

848
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,520
Seven Lady to finish it.

849
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:26,159
I'm not drinking that.

850
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,199
I won't.

851
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,159
Seventh Lady,

852
00:41:30,291 --> 00:41:32,211
you will only get better
if you take the medicine.

853
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:33,400
Grandma.

854
00:41:33,679 --> 00:41:34,599
Drink it.

855
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:36,159
You just recovered from the cold,

856
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:37,719
you need to rebuild your health.

857
00:41:37,759 --> 00:41:39,480
Your mother is doing this for your good.

858
00:41:39,679 --> 00:41:40,199
Drink it.

859
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:41,800
Come on.

860
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:53,199
It's too bitter.

861
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,000
Grandma, if I drink it,

862
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,360
I can't eat the meal anymore.

863
00:41:57,376 --> 00:41:58,520
You still have to drink it.

864
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:01,040
Look over there.

865
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,079
Old Madam, she...

866
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,559
I didn't see anything.

867
00:42:11,159 --> 00:42:13,360
If your mother asks,
I will tell her I don't know.

868
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,679
It's none of my business.
I didn't see anything.

869
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:17,679
Ms. Xu,

870
00:42:17,759 --> 00:42:19,079
you didn't see anything either.

871
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,199
Go on.

872
00:42:24,759 --> 00:42:26,520
This girl.

873
00:42:27,079 --> 00:42:29,639
You are just like your mother.

874
00:42:30,159 --> 00:42:31,520
She didn't like medicine,

875
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,320
so she always poured them
into the pots.

876
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,719
Her body was weak
when she was pregnant with you.

877
00:42:36,719 --> 00:42:39,159
She also drank the Mongolian milkvetch
and peony tonic.

878
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,520
But she couldn't stand the bitter taste,

879
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,520
so she always poured it
into hardy begonia pots.

880
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:46,679
Those hardy begonias withered

881
00:42:46,679 --> 00:42:49,079
a few days later.

882
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,920
(Mongolian milkvetch and peony tonic)

883
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,400
have mild properties.

884
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,199
They won't harm the plants.

885
00:42:58,559 --> 00:43:00,239
