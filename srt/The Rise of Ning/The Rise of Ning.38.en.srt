00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,179
(Duke Ying's Residence)

5
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:41,904
Very well.

6
00:01:42,343 --> 00:01:44,463
Wang Yuan has been imprisoned.

7
00:01:45,103 --> 00:01:46,862
He won't get away easily.

8
00:01:46,942 --> 00:01:47,942
Finally,

9
00:01:48,183 --> 00:01:50,302
you've helped Chen Jiuheng
and Chen Daoyan

10
00:01:50,302 --> 00:01:51,502
clear their names.

11
00:01:51,703 --> 00:01:52,582
You've also

12
00:01:53,063 --> 00:01:54,502
fulfilled your wish.

13
00:01:55,142 --> 00:01:57,422
Thank you for trusting me

14
00:01:57,463 --> 00:01:58,903
and helping me, Duke Ying.

15
00:01:59,302 --> 00:02:00,263
We have to join hands

16
00:02:00,543 --> 00:02:01,983
to bring the villains to justice.

17
00:02:04,302 --> 00:02:05,103
It seems

18
00:02:05,743 --> 00:02:07,382
you're not a simple person.

19
00:02:09,863 --> 00:02:10,782
Do you know

20
00:02:10,982 --> 00:02:13,143
I despise deceitful people?

21
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,423
If I have offended you,

22
00:02:18,423 --> 00:02:21,262
please forgive me.

23
00:02:24,982 --> 00:02:25,942
But why

24
00:02:27,262 --> 00:02:29,583
don't I despise you?

25
00:02:29,942 --> 00:02:31,542
I actually like you.

26
00:02:33,063 --> 00:02:33,863
Otherwise,

27
00:02:33,984 --> 00:02:35,900
you wouldn't have been able
to bring Wang Yuan down.

28
00:02:35,982 --> 00:02:36,702
You're young,

29
00:02:36,702 --> 00:02:38,343
and you have great patience.

30
00:02:38,702 --> 00:02:40,382
You have a bright prospect.

31
00:02:40,423 --> 00:02:41,779
You flatter me.

32
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:42,880
I don't deserve such praise.

33
00:02:44,343 --> 00:02:46,102
You predicted everything

34
00:02:46,382 --> 00:02:47,502
and made the decisive move.

35
00:02:47,702 --> 00:02:49,303
Stop the flattery.

36
00:02:50,583 --> 00:02:51,382
Speak up.

37
00:02:51,743 --> 00:02:53,782
Are you here to compliment me,

38
00:02:54,303 --> 00:02:55,782
or for my daughter?

39
00:02:58,743 --> 00:02:59,542
Go ahead.

40
00:02:59,982 --> 00:03:00,743
Yes.

41
00:03:05,382 --> 00:03:06,702
Old Madam Wei

42
00:03:06,702 --> 00:03:08,303
wants you to stay for dinner tonight.

43
00:03:08,382 --> 00:03:09,583
We can also have...

44
00:03:13,502 --> 00:03:15,262
Sure.

45
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:26,048
(Huanjing Pavilion)

46
00:03:44,303 --> 00:03:45,143
What are you doing?

47
00:03:46,672 --> 00:03:47,700
You didn't make a sound

48
00:03:47,702 --> 00:03:49,343
when you walked in.

49
00:03:50,262 --> 00:03:51,303
Come take a look.

50
00:03:51,542 --> 00:03:52,743
I drew you.

51
00:03:53,303 --> 00:03:54,502
I want to hang this

52
00:03:54,502 --> 00:03:55,583
by your bedside

53
00:03:55,743 --> 00:03:57,102
so you can see it every day

54
00:03:57,262 --> 00:03:59,382
and stop making foolish mistakes.

55
00:04:03,382 --> 00:04:04,423
Have you recovered yet?

56
00:04:04,423 --> 00:04:06,343
You thought about asking me
after all this time.

57
00:04:06,423 --> 00:04:07,583
It's healed.

58
00:04:08,143 --> 00:04:09,343
I'm sorry.

59
00:04:11,222 --> 00:04:12,623
Father told me

60
00:04:12,782 --> 00:04:14,382
about your plans.

61
00:04:14,423 --> 00:04:15,303
If Wang Yuan

62
00:04:15,303 --> 00:04:16,822
hadn't hurt me and Father,

63
00:04:17,502 --> 00:04:19,262
you would've kept hiding from me,
wouldn't you?

64
00:04:20,743 --> 00:04:21,543
I didn't want

65
00:04:21,582 --> 00:04:23,183
to get you involved.

66
00:04:23,623 --> 00:04:25,502
Duke Ying and I

67
00:04:25,582 --> 00:04:27,223
took a risk this time,

68
00:04:27,983 --> 00:04:29,303
so I didn't tell you

69
00:04:29,423 --> 00:04:30,582
about the follow-up plan.

70
00:04:31,663 --> 00:04:33,863
Father also told me

71
00:04:34,223 --> 00:04:36,983
you'd apologize and kowtow to me.

72
00:04:43,502 --> 00:04:44,702
You're really going to do that?

73
00:04:55,822 --> 00:04:57,103
I'll do anything

74
00:04:57,582 --> 00:04:59,022
as long as you're not angry anymore.

75
00:04:59,863 --> 00:05:01,863
You want my forgiveness?

76
00:05:01,863 --> 00:05:03,423
Look at what you did just now.

77
00:05:04,063 --> 00:05:06,223
You lied to me
when I wanted to help you up.

78
00:05:10,582 --> 00:05:11,223
Does it hurt?

79
00:05:12,303 --> 00:05:13,863
Young Lady, Third Young Master,

80
00:05:14,502 --> 00:05:15,663
dinner is served.

81
00:05:15,663 --> 00:05:17,063
You may proceed to the main hall.

82
00:05:17,303 --> 00:05:18,663
Let's go eat.

83
00:05:27,303 --> 00:05:28,103
Your Lordship,

84
00:05:28,303 --> 00:05:29,902
will Wang Yuan lie to you?

85
00:05:29,902 --> 00:05:30,902
Did he really keep it

86
00:05:30,902 --> 00:05:31,902
here?

87
00:05:31,902 --> 00:05:32,702
Keep searching.

88
00:05:32,783 --> 00:05:33,582
Yes.

89
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:36,689
(Studies on Du Fu's Poem Collection)

90
00:06:05,783 --> 00:06:06,663
Your Lordship,

91
00:06:07,502 --> 00:06:08,262
what's wrong?

92
00:06:09,783 --> 00:06:11,423
Wang Yuan.

93
00:06:16,702 --> 00:06:17,502
I didn't expect you

94
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,502
to have such remarkable patience

95
00:06:19,702 --> 00:06:21,863
at this young age,
Third Young Master Luo.

96
00:06:22,183 --> 00:06:23,702
You're brave and intelligent.

97
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:26,303
Let me give you a toast.

98
00:06:27,952 --> 00:06:29,300
You flatter me, Old Madam Wei.

99
00:06:29,303 --> 00:06:30,822
That's a high praise.

100
00:06:31,262 --> 00:06:33,063
Thanks to Duke Ying,

101
00:06:33,063 --> 00:06:34,822
the plan succeeded.

102
00:06:41,183 --> 00:06:42,303
Third Young Master Luo,

103
00:06:43,702 --> 00:06:45,262
you're not engaged, are you?

104
00:06:45,502 --> 00:06:46,262
Not yet.

105
00:06:47,063 --> 00:06:48,262
That's wonderful.

106
00:06:48,303 --> 00:06:49,262
What do you think

107
00:06:49,423 --> 00:06:52,262
of Mingzhu?

108
00:07:00,183 --> 00:07:01,183
Grand... Grandma,

109
00:07:01,502 --> 00:07:03,022
are you trying to find a man

110
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:04,502
and marry me off

111
00:07:04,623 --> 00:07:06,303
because you're tired of me?

112
00:07:07,623 --> 00:07:08,502
Nonsense.

113
00:07:08,902 --> 00:07:12,063
I just think you two
would make a good match.

114
00:07:13,822 --> 00:07:14,979
I think Yining

115
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,848
and Third Young Master Luo
are a better match.

116
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,939
That's only because Yining

117
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,448
and Third Young Master Luo are siblings

118
00:07:20,462 --> 00:07:22,702
who grew up together,

119
00:07:22,863 --> 00:07:23,902
so

120
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:25,063
they seem

121
00:07:25,262 --> 00:07:27,262
closer.

122
00:07:29,022 --> 00:07:29,502
But

123
00:07:29,502 --> 00:07:31,183
they aren't real siblings.

124
00:07:39,822 --> 00:07:40,623
Mother,

125
00:07:41,183 --> 00:07:43,063
it's rare for us all to gather.

126
00:07:43,063 --> 00:07:44,702
Come, let's drink.

127
00:07:45,462 --> 00:07:47,462
I'll give you a toast.

128
00:07:47,983 --> 00:07:49,223
Just one toast.

129
00:08:05,168 --> 00:08:06,880
I'll tell them to choose a proposal date

130
00:08:07,183 --> 00:08:08,262
once I go back.

131
00:08:08,702 --> 00:08:09,863
Why did you suddenly

132
00:08:09,863 --> 00:08:10,902
bring this up again?

133
00:08:11,103 --> 00:08:12,623
I promised you

134
00:08:13,183 --> 00:08:14,103
that I'd propose to you

135
00:08:14,582 --> 00:08:15,623
once everything is over.

136
00:08:24,502 --> 00:08:25,502
I'm leaving.

137
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:32,838
(Luo's Residence)

138
00:08:33,063 --> 00:08:34,263
Shenyuan

139
00:08:34,383 --> 00:08:35,462
is intelligent,

140
00:08:35,622 --> 00:08:36,702
brave, and strategic.

141
00:08:37,102 --> 00:08:38,702
He's as sharp as...

142
00:08:39,462 --> 00:08:40,582
As sharp as a tack.

143
00:08:40,622 --> 00:08:42,622
Yes, that's right, my dear.

144
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:43,423
As sharp as a tack.

145
00:08:43,423 --> 00:08:45,023
I'm too happy that I forgot.

146
00:08:46,383 --> 00:08:47,303
By the way, Mother,

147
00:08:47,783 --> 00:08:50,663
Shenyuan went through a lot,

148
00:08:51,102 --> 00:08:51,862
so please...

149
00:08:53,423 --> 00:08:54,462
Shenyuan

150
00:08:54,702 --> 00:08:55,543
was concerned

151
00:08:55,543 --> 00:08:57,383
that I might be too weak
to handle the situation,

152
00:08:57,702 --> 00:08:58,862
so he told me

153
00:08:59,023 --> 00:09:00,862
beforehand.

154
00:09:01,702 --> 00:09:02,503
Mother,

155
00:09:03,503 --> 00:09:04,783
you knew about this earlier?

156
00:09:04,783 --> 00:09:05,503
So

157
00:09:06,102 --> 00:09:08,303
you punished Shenyuan...

158
00:09:10,263 --> 00:09:11,702
To put on a show for outsiders.

159
00:09:19,102 --> 00:09:19,903
Shenyuan,

160
00:09:20,663 --> 00:09:22,862
you still let Yining

161
00:09:23,023 --> 00:09:23,982
get hurt.

162
00:09:25,543 --> 00:09:26,342
Yes.

163
00:09:26,862 --> 00:09:28,702
I've already apologized to her.

164
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:33,063
You also got hurt yourself.

165
00:09:36,102 --> 00:09:37,102
It's my fault.

166
00:09:38,102 --> 00:09:39,263
Anyway,

167
00:09:39,263 --> 00:09:40,783
bear this in mind.

168
00:09:41,263 --> 00:09:43,183
All of you are the descendants
of the Luo Family,

169
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:45,303
especially you and Yining.

170
00:09:45,582 --> 00:09:47,982
Don't cause any more trouble.

171
00:09:48,663 --> 00:09:50,663
I'm already old.

172
00:09:50,783 --> 00:09:51,582
If anything

173
00:09:51,582 --> 00:09:53,183
were to happen to you,

174
00:09:54,102 --> 00:09:56,303
how would I carry on?

175
00:09:58,503 --> 00:09:59,503
I will bear this in mind.

176
00:10:04,263 --> 00:10:05,102
Shenyuan,

177
00:10:05,582 --> 00:10:06,383
when I saw you

178
00:10:06,383 --> 00:10:07,822
instructing your people last time,

179
00:10:07,862 --> 00:10:08,663
I knew

180
00:10:08,663 --> 00:10:10,063
you were exceptional.

181
00:10:10,582 --> 00:10:12,702
I can't believe you own Liuhe Tavern.

182
00:10:15,023 --> 00:10:15,903
Can we

183
00:10:15,903 --> 00:10:17,263
have free meals afterward?

184
00:10:17,263 --> 00:10:18,383
Of course. No problem.

185
00:10:18,862 --> 00:10:20,503
Let's go there every day from now on.

186
00:10:22,183 --> 00:10:23,783
By the way, Shenyuan,

187
00:10:24,263 --> 00:10:26,622
shouldn't you refund all the money

188
00:10:27,862 --> 00:10:29,503
we've spent there?

189
00:10:30,822 --> 00:10:32,063
You're thick-skinned.

190
00:10:34,222 --> 00:10:35,023
Ignore him.

191
00:10:35,742 --> 00:10:36,383
Hairu,

192
00:10:36,383 --> 00:10:38,063
am I really your blood brother?

193
00:10:38,063 --> 00:10:39,383
Why don't you take my side?

194
00:10:39,663 --> 00:10:41,183
Shenyuan is my son.

195
00:10:41,582 --> 00:10:42,822
Of course,

196
00:10:44,063 --> 00:10:44,903
my son

197
00:10:45,783 --> 00:10:47,063
is more important.

198
00:10:57,183 --> 00:10:57,982
Grandma.

199
00:10:58,702 --> 00:10:59,622
Father. Mother.

200
00:11:00,303 --> 00:11:03,183
I have a favor to ask.

201
00:11:04,303 --> 00:11:05,222
What is it?

202
00:11:05,982 --> 00:11:06,982
Why are you so serious?

203
00:11:09,702 --> 00:11:10,903
I'd like to propose marriage.

204
00:11:11,143 --> 00:11:11,942
That's good.

205
00:11:12,383 --> 00:11:13,822
Which lady do you like?

206
00:11:17,023 --> 00:11:17,822
It's Yining.

207
00:11:21,423 --> 00:11:22,383
Which Yining?

208
00:11:23,663 --> 00:11:24,622
To me,

209
00:11:24,702 --> 00:11:26,383
there's only one Yining in this world.

210
00:11:55,903 --> 00:11:57,063
You're here.

211
00:11:58,263 --> 00:12:00,702
I suppose you've searched everywhere.

212
00:12:02,903 --> 00:12:04,582
You won't find it.

213
00:12:08,663 --> 00:12:09,903
Do you think

214
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:12,423
that by killing Chen Long, Chen Yang,

215
00:12:12,702 --> 00:12:14,903
and everyone on the ship,

216
00:12:15,063 --> 00:12:17,462
you could destroy all the evidence?

217
00:12:19,383 --> 00:12:22,063
You've underestimated me.

218
00:12:23,303 --> 00:12:24,702
If I die,

219
00:12:25,023 --> 00:12:28,023
the profit-sharing agreement
with your signature

220
00:12:28,303 --> 00:12:31,423
will be presented to His Majesty.

221
00:12:33,903 --> 00:12:34,702
Chancellor Wang,

222
00:12:36,903 --> 00:12:38,263
do you think I'd believe that?

223
00:12:38,903 --> 00:12:40,023
That agreement

224
00:12:40,702 --> 00:12:42,063
has already burned into ashes.

225
00:12:44,862 --> 00:12:46,503
It's a shame

226
00:12:47,702 --> 00:12:49,663
that such important evidence
is burned.

227
00:12:50,063 --> 00:12:51,702
I was just involved in smuggling

228
00:12:51,702 --> 00:12:53,063
and took a small profit.

229
00:12:54,503 --> 00:12:55,582
It's not a crime worth death.

230
00:12:57,783 --> 00:12:59,063
Do you think

231
00:13:00,023 --> 00:13:01,862
you can stay clean in this matter?

232
00:13:11,263 --> 00:13:12,102
Surrender it now.

233
00:13:13,503 --> 00:13:14,303
Otherwise,

234
00:13:15,663 --> 00:13:17,222
I will make you suffer.

235
00:13:19,063 --> 00:13:21,783
Do you want to die with me?

236
00:13:26,063 --> 00:13:27,503
Bring it on.

237
00:13:35,263 --> 00:13:37,183
You're smart, Marquis Lu.

238
00:13:37,903 --> 00:13:39,702
You won't be reckless

239
00:13:40,183 --> 00:13:42,063
to destroy yourself with me.

240
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,263
What exactly do you want?

241
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:03,400
(Zhizhai Hall)

242
00:14:04,063 --> 00:14:06,383
How many hours have passed?

243
00:14:07,383 --> 00:14:09,622
Six hours, Your Lordship.

244
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:11,622
Six hours, I see.

245
00:14:12,862 --> 00:14:14,503
That should be enough.

246
00:14:19,143 --> 00:14:19,702
All right.

247
00:14:21,663 --> 00:14:22,143
Go on.

248
00:14:25,222 --> 00:14:26,183
I shall take my leave.

249
00:14:30,102 --> 00:14:31,263
Marquis Lu,

250
00:14:33,023 --> 00:14:33,903
I apologize.

251
00:14:34,503 --> 00:14:35,982
Sorry to keep you waiting.

252
00:14:36,263 --> 00:14:38,582
There are some military affairs
to attend to.

253
00:14:42,702 --> 00:14:44,303
That's important.

254
00:14:44,303 --> 00:14:45,503
It's all right.

255
00:14:46,063 --> 00:14:47,462
It's not urgent.

256
00:14:47,903 --> 00:14:49,183
It's about a deputy general

257
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:50,622
who harbored bad intentions

258
00:14:50,622 --> 00:14:53,102
and colluded with immoral merchants
for personal gain,

259
00:14:53,102 --> 00:14:54,783
which is against my values.

260
00:14:55,303 --> 00:14:56,063
I've already sent

261
00:14:56,063 --> 00:14:58,183
General Li to deal with it.

262
00:14:58,702 --> 00:15:00,423
If he would come clean

263
00:15:00,423 --> 00:15:01,582
and repent his mistake,

264
00:15:01,622 --> 00:15:03,503
I won't punish him severely.

265
00:15:03,702 --> 00:15:05,503
But if he doesn't,

266
00:15:05,503 --> 00:15:07,222
he'll be executed

267
00:15:07,423 --> 00:15:08,503
with no mercy.

268
00:15:09,383 --> 00:15:11,503
Duke Ying, you're strict and generous

269
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:12,783
in managing your soldiers.

270
00:15:12,903 --> 00:15:13,903
I'm deeply impressed.

271
00:15:15,023 --> 00:15:15,822
Marquis Lu,

272
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:18,383
you should know

273
00:15:19,183 --> 00:15:21,503
the imperial court is
like a battlefield.

274
00:15:22,023 --> 00:15:24,063
Fame, power, and wealth

275
00:15:24,263 --> 00:15:25,982
are tempting traps.

276
00:15:26,063 --> 00:15:27,222
A single lapse of judgment

277
00:15:27,702 --> 00:15:30,303
can lead to grave mistakes.
That can be forgiven.

278
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:31,783
What's truly frightening is

279
00:15:32,063 --> 00:15:35,263
when one takes chances to commit crimes,
even knowing it's wrong,

280
00:15:35,702 --> 00:15:38,183
and continues down that dark path.

281
00:15:40,063 --> 00:15:41,582
You're right.

282
00:15:42,263 --> 00:15:43,342
That being said,

283
00:15:44,023 --> 00:15:45,063
if there were a bright path

284
00:15:45,063 --> 00:15:46,263
to choose,

285
00:15:47,503 --> 00:15:48,143
who would take

286
00:15:48,143 --> 00:15:49,503
the dark one?

287
00:15:52,383 --> 00:15:53,183
All right.

288
00:15:56,063 --> 00:15:56,862
Marquis Lu,

289
00:15:57,702 --> 00:15:58,702
I appreciate

290
00:15:59,063 --> 00:16:00,862
what you did for my family.

291
00:16:01,303 --> 00:16:02,102
However,

292
00:16:02,783 --> 00:16:05,063
we uphold different beliefs.

293
00:16:06,063 --> 00:16:08,023
Let's not meet much from now on.

294
00:16:08,503 --> 00:16:11,503
I wish you the best.

295
00:16:20,173 --> 00:16:23,509
(Duke Ying's Residence)

296
00:16:28,582 --> 00:16:29,383
Your Lordship,

297
00:16:30,622 --> 00:16:31,702
I heard that Luo Shenyuan

298
00:16:31,728 --> 00:16:33,600
plans to propose marriage
to Duke Ying's Residence.

299
00:16:36,263 --> 00:16:37,982
I won't give him that chance.

300
00:16:38,702 --> 00:16:40,263
But Duke Ying's attitude...

301
00:16:41,822 --> 00:16:44,183
Why don't you just give up?

302
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:45,903
In this life,

303
00:16:49,862 --> 00:16:51,222
I will never let go of her again.

304
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:54,102
Your Lordship, Wang Yuan...

305
00:17:14,303 --> 00:17:15,463
"Third Sister-in-law"?

306
00:17:16,463 --> 00:17:18,303
Don't talk nonsense, Sixth Sister.

307
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:19,689
I heard

308
00:17:19,690 --> 00:17:21,472
Third Brother would go to
Duke Ying's Residence

309
00:17:21,472 --> 00:17:22,320
to propose marriage.

310
00:17:22,384 --> 00:17:23,300
In the future,

311
00:17:23,862 --> 00:17:25,422
you'll be my third sister-in-law.

312
00:17:26,102 --> 00:17:26,902
By that logic,

313
00:17:26,902 --> 00:17:28,263
you're going to marry Sixth Uncle.

314
00:17:28,263 --> 00:17:29,102
I should also

315
00:17:29,102 --> 00:17:30,463
call you Sixth Aunt, right?

316
00:17:31,223 --> 00:17:32,703
It seems so.

317
00:17:33,422 --> 00:17:34,503
Why don't you try

318
00:17:34,503 --> 00:17:35,263
calling me that now?

319
00:17:36,463 --> 00:17:37,819
You've become naughty

320
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:38,960
after being with Sixth Uncle.

321
00:17:42,703 --> 00:17:43,503
Sixth Sister,

322
00:17:43,902 --> 00:17:45,902
when you marry and move to Lin'an,

323
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:46,902
won't we be able

324
00:17:46,902 --> 00:17:48,342
to have fun together

325
00:17:48,382 --> 00:17:49,783
like before?

326
00:17:49,862 --> 00:17:50,662
No.

327
00:17:50,662 --> 00:17:51,503
The Lin Family bought

328
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:52,822
him a residence in the capital.

329
00:17:52,822 --> 00:17:53,703
After getting married,

330
00:17:53,703 --> 00:17:54,703
we'll come back here.

331
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:55,360
The business

332
00:17:55,376 --> 00:17:56,890
in Yanrong Pavilion needs to carry on.

333
00:17:56,912 --> 00:17:57,460
We can still

334
00:17:57,463 --> 00:17:58,622
have fun

335
00:17:58,622 --> 00:18:00,023
and eat together every day

336
00:18:00,023 --> 00:18:00,902
like we used to.

337
00:18:02,063 --> 00:18:04,182
Sixth Uncle is considerate.

338
00:18:04,263 --> 00:18:05,263
I'm really happy

339
00:18:05,263 --> 00:18:06,902
to finally see a lovely couple

340
00:18:06,983 --> 00:18:08,223
together.

341
00:18:08,543 --> 00:18:08,983
Of course.

342
00:18:08,983 --> 00:18:10,063
I'm good

343
00:18:10,182 --> 00:18:11,063
at picking

344
00:18:11,063 --> 00:18:12,223
a fine husband.

345
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:13,983
But I used to think

346
00:18:13,983 --> 00:18:15,503
that you two were siblings.

347
00:18:15,703 --> 00:18:16,902
Now, you're going to marry him.

348
00:18:16,943 --> 00:18:17,703
Honestly, everyone

349
00:18:17,703 --> 00:18:19,102
is a bit surprised.

350
00:18:22,783 --> 00:18:23,622
Sixth Sister,

351
00:18:24,023 --> 00:18:26,263
what should I do

352
00:18:26,303 --> 00:18:28,263
now that our identities

353
00:18:29,263 --> 00:18:31,662
have changed?

354
00:18:34,862 --> 00:18:35,662
Yixiu.

355
00:18:36,063 --> 00:18:37,263
What took you so long?

356
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,839
These osmanthus pastries are fresh.

357
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:40,360
I had to wait in a long line
to get them.

358
00:18:40,368 --> 00:18:40,864
Try them.

359
00:18:40,864 --> 00:18:41,500
No.

360
00:18:41,902 --> 00:18:42,703
Try them.

361
00:18:42,703 --> 00:18:43,422
No.

362
00:18:43,503 --> 00:18:44,582
It's really nice. Come on.

363
00:18:44,862 --> 00:18:45,662
All right, then.

364
00:18:51,223 --> 00:18:52,023
How does it taste?

365
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,342
Pretty good.

366
00:19:05,503 --> 00:19:06,622
Why are you smiling?

367
00:19:08,582 --> 00:19:10,182
Why did you suddenly ask this?

368
00:19:11,503 --> 00:19:12,422
I understand now.

369
00:19:12,662 --> 00:19:14,223
You're asking me
[Watch on www.kisskh.la or www.kisskh.co to support Admin]

370
00:19:14,223 --> 00:19:15,822
how to get along with a husband.

About this...

372
00:19:21,902 --> 00:19:22,622
Well...

373

Did you both...

374
00:19:38,503 --> 00:19:39,303
You did.

375
00:19:39,622 --> 00:19:40,543
That's settled, then.

376
00:19:40,582 --> 00:19:41,783
Why are you still asking me?

00:20:58,063 --> 00:20:59,582
What fragrance

385
00:20:59,703 --> 00:21:01,223
do you use?

386
00:21:01,463 --> 00:21:02,263
Fragrance?

387
00:21:03,622 --> 00:21:04,902
I don't use that.

388
00:21:06,023 --> 00:21:07,263
I didn't know

389
00:21:07,822 --> 00:21:09,382
you had

390
00:21:09,662 --> 00:21:10,902
a unique scent.

391
00:21:17,503 --> 00:21:18,902
I should let Sixth Uncle

392
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,063
smell it, too.

393
00:21:20,182 --> 00:21:21,822
Perhaps he can create

394
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:23,223
a fragrance for men.

395
00:21:24,023 --> 00:21:26,263
That might be a great opportunity.

396
00:21:27,182 --> 00:21:28,063
Are you done?

(Caifu Abode)

403
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:01,376
Hairu.

404
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,816
Well, have the people

405
00:22:02,902 --> 00:22:04,703
from the Lin Family
who are for the wedding

406
00:22:04,822 --> 00:22:06,182
been settled in?

407
00:22:06,582 --> 00:22:08,543
We must make sure
they're comfortable here.

408
00:22:08,582 --> 00:22:09,622
Don't worry, Mother.

409
00:22:09,622 --> 00:22:10,783
I've taken care of everything.

410
00:22:12,063 --> 00:22:12,902
Also,

411
00:22:13,223 --> 00:22:14,703
you've been busy

412
00:22:14,703 --> 00:22:16,303
with Yixiu's wedding.

413
00:22:16,422 --> 00:22:17,662
It must be tiring.

414
00:22:17,662 --> 00:22:19,303
I'm really grateful to you.

415
00:22:20,263 --> 00:22:21,902
Why are you so courteous to me?

416
00:22:21,902 --> 00:22:23,662
Yixiu must feel uncomfortable not having

417
00:22:23,822 --> 00:22:25,662
her parents by her side
when she gets married.

418
00:22:26,102 --> 00:22:27,063
Second Master and I

419
00:22:27,063 --> 00:22:28,303
have discussed this.

420
00:22:28,382 --> 00:22:29,862
Sixth Lady's dowry

421
00:22:29,902 --> 00:22:32,303
can only be more than others.

422
00:22:32,503 --> 00:22:34,102
The dowry

423
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:34,862
has been prepared

424
00:22:34,862 --> 00:22:36,223
according to the highest standard.

425
00:22:36,582 --> 00:22:37,662
Mao said

426
00:22:37,662 --> 00:22:39,303
he'd give Sixth Lady the best

427
00:22:39,303 --> 00:22:41,303
and wouldn't let anyone
look down on her.

428
00:22:41,503 --> 00:22:42,382
Right.

429
00:22:45,503 --> 00:22:47,703
Grandma, Mother.

430
00:22:47,902 --> 00:22:49,223
Ning, you're here, too.

431
00:22:49,223 --> 00:22:51,822
Come and take a look

432
00:22:51,983 --> 00:22:54,023
at your sixth sister's dowry.

433
00:22:57,983 --> 00:22:58,783
Xiu,

434
00:22:59,303 --> 00:23:01,223
you have to thank your second aunt.

435
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:03,582
She's done so much for you.

436
00:23:03,822 --> 00:23:04,622
Look.

437
00:23:04,622 --> 00:23:06,662
There are five carriages

438
00:23:06,662 --> 00:23:08,943
of accessories and clothing.

439
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:11,783
Thank you, Second Aunt.

440
00:23:11,983 --> 00:23:12,943
We're family.

441
00:23:12,983 --> 00:23:14,463
There's no need to thank me.

442
00:23:14,822 --> 00:23:15,622
Actually,

443
00:23:15,662 --> 00:23:17,303
your mother prepared your dowry

444
00:23:17,303 --> 00:23:18,223
a long time ago.

445
00:23:18,223 --> 00:23:19,662
I didn't do much.

446
00:23:20,023 --> 00:23:20,859
I didn't expect

447
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,792
there would be so much

448
00:23:21,824 --> 00:23:23,060
gold and silver jewelry

449
00:23:23,102 --> 00:23:23,983
aside from

450
00:23:23,983 --> 00:23:25,543
those shops and estates.

451
00:23:25,582 --> 00:23:26,382
It's nothing much.

452
00:23:26,622 --> 00:23:28,303
They are just a small gesture

453
00:23:28,303 --> 00:23:29,382
from your grandma and us.

454
00:23:29,543 --> 00:23:30,342
Xiu,

455
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:32,543
you're getting married soon.

456
00:23:33,303 --> 00:23:35,463
Fortunately, it's to the Lin Family.

457
00:23:35,503 --> 00:23:36,822
They're a big family,

458
00:23:36,822 --> 00:23:38,299
and everyone has a good nature.

459
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,504
You'll get along well with them

460
00:23:39,568 --> 00:23:40,500
when you go there.

461
00:23:40,662 --> 00:23:42,303
Besides, Lin Mao and you

462
00:23:42,303 --> 00:23:43,662
truly love each other.

463
00:23:43,662 --> 00:23:46,303
That puts my mind at ease.

464
00:23:46,582 --> 00:23:48,463
I'm sorry to make you worry,
Grandma.

465
00:23:49,063 --> 00:23:50,662
Don't worry, Mother.

466
00:23:50,902 --> 00:23:51,902
Mao said

467
00:23:51,902 --> 00:23:53,303
he and Sixth Lady

468
00:23:53,303 --> 00:23:54,662
would stay in the capital

469
00:23:54,662 --> 00:23:56,063
after they were married.

470
00:23:56,263 --> 00:23:58,102
They'll have time

471
00:23:58,102 --> 00:23:59,422
to visit you often.

472
00:23:59,783 --> 00:24:00,783
That's right, Grandma.

473
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:02,662
Sixth Sister and I

474
00:24:02,662 --> 00:24:04,382
still need to run
Yanrong Pavilion together.

475
00:24:04,582 --> 00:24:05,422
Xiu

476
00:24:05,422 --> 00:24:07,023
is getting married soon.

477
00:24:07,023 --> 00:24:08,303
Only you

478
00:24:08,382 --> 00:24:09,582
are left.

479
00:24:11,223 --> 00:24:12,263
Grandma,

480
00:24:12,382 --> 00:24:13,902
don't make fun of me.

481
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,692
(Sanjiu Apothecary)

482
00:24:20,822 --> 00:24:21,142
Come.

483
00:24:21,342 --> 00:24:21,822
Look at this.

484
00:24:30,662 --> 00:24:31,783
Sanjiu Apothecary?

485
00:24:33,622 --> 00:24:36,263
Why did you bring me here?

486
00:24:37,182 --> 00:24:38,862
This is Shenyuan's apothecary.

487
00:24:40,182 --> 00:24:41,902
I'm also one of the owners.

488
00:24:42,182 --> 00:24:43,182
I should bring you to visit

489
00:24:43,182 --> 00:24:44,303
your husband's shop.

490
00:24:44,862 --> 00:24:46,543
What husband?

491
00:24:46,582 --> 00:24:48,063
We're not married yet.

492
00:24:48,102 --> 00:24:49,822
We will get married soon.

493
00:24:50,223 --> 00:24:51,622
But when did you

494
00:24:51,622 --> 00:24:53,422
become Sanjiu Apothecary's owner?

495
00:24:53,463 --> 00:24:54,303
Shenyuan valued

496
00:24:54,303 --> 00:24:55,582
my skills in medicine,

497
00:24:55,622 --> 00:24:56,463
so he made me

498
00:24:56,463 --> 00:24:57,582
one of the owners.

499
00:24:58,503 --> 00:25:00,463
You brought me here

500
00:25:01,182 --> 00:25:01,983
to show off?

501
00:25:02,063 --> 00:25:03,102
Certainly not.

502
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:04,223
Didn't you say

503
00:25:04,223 --> 00:25:05,783
you're having a headache lately?

504
00:25:05,902 --> 00:25:07,382
I'm worried you might catch a cold,

505
00:25:07,822 --> 00:25:09,223
so I have them prepare
some medicine.

506
00:25:10,063 --> 00:25:12,023
We came here to collect the medicine.

507
00:25:13,102 --> 00:25:14,102
Thank you.

508
00:25:14,703 --> 00:25:15,822
It's only trivial.

509
00:25:15,822 --> 00:25:17,622
I just didn't sleep well.

510
00:25:18,023 --> 00:25:18,862
You didn't sleep well?

511
00:25:19,422 --> 00:25:20,223
Yixiu,

512
00:25:20,503 --> 00:25:21,099
I know

513
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,176
it's more difficult for you

514
00:25:22,192 --> 00:25:23,504
as the wedding day is approaching.

515
00:25:23,902 --> 00:25:24,783
Other ladies

516
00:25:24,783 --> 00:25:26,223
have their parents to send them off,

517
00:25:26,422 --> 00:25:27,822
but your families aren't here.

518
00:25:27,902 --> 00:25:28,979
Anyway, don't worry.

519
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:29,904
After we get married,

520
00:25:29,968 --> 00:25:31,300
I'll treat you even better

521
00:25:31,463 --> 00:25:32,303
and make up

522
00:25:32,303 --> 00:25:33,503
for all your regrets.

523
00:26:06,382 --> 00:26:08,063
I bid you farewell, Grandma.

524
00:26:08,422 --> 00:26:10,422
I bid you farewell,
Second Uncle and Second Aunt.

525
00:26:19,342 --> 00:26:20,303
Yixiu,

526
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:21,983
once you marry,

527
00:26:22,182 --> 00:26:24,182
you must get along well
with your husband

528
00:26:24,223 --> 00:26:25,822
and respect and love each other.

529
00:26:26,422 --> 00:26:27,943
I'll remember your words.

530
00:26:28,543 --> 00:26:29,342
Yixiu,

531
00:26:29,503 --> 00:26:31,023
if Lin Mao mistreats you,

532
00:26:31,382 --> 00:26:32,422
tell me.

533
00:26:32,422 --> 00:26:33,822
I'll teach him a lesson.

534
00:26:34,063 --> 00:26:35,063
Thank you, Second Aunt.

535
00:26:40,902 --> 00:26:42,543
The auspicious hour has arrived.

536
00:26:42,543 --> 00:26:45,902
The bride may get in the sedan chair.

537
00:27:15,662 --> 00:27:17,422
The bride departs from home.

538
00:27:17,662 --> 00:27:19,543
May harmony

539
00:27:19,662 --> 00:27:21,822

Sit.

546
00:28:42,382 --> 00:28:43,622
Why so secretive?

547
00:28:43,622 --> 00:28:45,063
What do you want to show me?

548
00:28:50,822 --> 00:28:51,783
This is so cute.

549
00:28:52,182 --> 00:28:53,582
Did you draw all these?

550
00:28:54,783 --> 00:28:56,223
This is when you were five.

551
00:28:56,503 --> 00:28:58,342
You climbed the tree in front of my door

552
00:28:58,342 --> 00:28:59,303
to steal dates.

553
00:28:59,783 --> 00:29:01,063
I wasn't stealing.

554
00:29:01,543 --> 00:29:03,342
I was picking them in the open.

555
00:29:03,342 --> 00:29:05,223
Fine. You were picking them openly.

556
00:29:05,662 --> 00:29:06,662
Look at you.

557
00:29:06,743 --> 00:29:07,743
Sitting here

558
00:29:07,743 --> 00:29:09,063
and looking at me from behind.

559
00:29:09,063 --> 00:29:10,102
Look at this.

560
00:29:10,102 --> 00:29:11,902
In my paintings, you were peeking at me.

561
00:29:15,342 --> 00:29:17,063
This is what you call
a priceless treasure?

562
00:29:17,063 --> 00:29:17,783
Isn't this

563
00:29:17,783 --> 00:29:19,223
just a random drawing?

564
00:29:20,902 --> 00:29:21,662
Can't you tell

565
00:29:21,662 --> 00:29:23,102
where the priceless treasure is?

566
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:24,182
I can't.

567
00:29:25,543 --> 00:29:27,902
It's the person in this drawing.

568
00:29:27,983 --> 00:29:29,422
Smooth talker.

569
00:29:32,463 --> 00:29:33,303
What is this?

570
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:35,822
This is my betrothal letter
for proposal.

571
00:29:36,382 --> 00:29:37,662
It contains my birth chart

572

00:29:42,382 --> 00:29:43,063
Shouldn't this

575
00:29:43,063 --> 00:29:44,662
be reviewed by parents?

576
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:45,862
Why are you giving me this?

577
00:29:47,263 --> 00:29:48,703
So you have no objections?

578
00:29:50,182 --> 00:29:51,902
Very well. Got it.

579
00:29:52,503 --> 00:29:53,783
I don't have objections.

580
00:29:53,783 --> 00:29:55,582
But I have three conditions.

581
00:29:55,743 --> 00:29:56,582
Sure. Speak away.

582
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,928
First, I won't blindly follow everything
you say or do.

583
00:29:58,928 --> 00:30:00,902
Also, I'm not a wife who stays at home.

584
00:30:00,902 --> 00:30:02,059
At home,

585
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,536
you should listen to everything I say.

586
00:30:04,063 --> 00:30:04,783
Second,

587
00:30:04,783 --> 00:30:06,463
do not visit brothels

588
00:30:06,463 --> 00:30:08,662
or take concubines.

589
00:30:08,703 --> 00:30:09,822
You can like

590
00:30:09,822 --> 00:30:10,582
only me.

591
00:30:14,063 --> 00:30:16,703
As long as you don't force me
to take concubines.

592
00:30:17,263 --> 00:30:17,943
Why would I

593
00:30:17,943 --> 00:30:19,223
even do that?

594
00:30:19,223 --> 00:30:19,902
I'm not foolish.

595
00:30:19,902 --> 00:30:21,622
All right. What about the third?

596
00:30:22,223 --> 00:30:23,263
Third,

597
00:30:26,862 --> 00:30:28,422
do not keep a secret stash.

598
00:30:28,592 --> 00:30:30,060
I've given you the betrothal letter.

599
00:30:30,063 --> 00:30:31,342
I don't have any secret stash.

600
00:30:31,503 --> 00:30:33,503
Luo Shenyuan, don't try to fool me.

601
00:30:33,822 --> 00:30:35,263
I've known you long enough.

602
00:30:35,263 --> 00:30:36,303
This slim letter

603
00:30:36,303 --> 00:30:37,622
contains all your properties?

604
00:30:37,622 --> 00:30:38,822
This is a betrothal letter.

605
00:30:38,822 --> 00:30:39,382
Of course,

606
00:30:39,382 --> 00:30:40,662
this is all I have.

607
00:30:41,023 --> 00:30:42,063
Let me repeat.

608
00:30:42,182 --> 00:30:43,182
First,

609
00:30:43,182 --> 00:30:44,382
you'll take charge

610
00:30:44,382 --> 00:30:45,743
of household matters.

611
00:30:45,822 --> 00:30:47,382
I'll give you

612
00:30:47,382 --> 00:30:48,303
all my properties.

613
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,600
This betrothal letter is the proof.

614
00:30:49,632 --> 00:30:50,300
Second,

615
00:30:50,662 --> 00:30:52,703
I'll never take concubines.

616
00:30:52,743 --> 00:30:54,023
You're my only wife

617
00:30:54,142 --> 00:30:56,102
in this life.

618
00:30:57,902 --> 00:30:58,662
Third,

619
00:30:59,342 --> 00:31:00,743
I have no secret stash.

620
00:31:01,422 --> 00:31:01,862
Very well.

621
00:31:02,503 --> 00:31:03,622
Since you understand,

622
00:31:03,622 --> 00:31:05,063
when are you going to formally propose?

623
00:31:08,862 --> 00:31:09,822
Right away.

624
00:31:13,784 --> 00:31:15,878
(Duke Ying's Residence)

625
00:31:17,102 --> 00:31:17,902
Duke Ying.

626
00:31:20,783 --> 00:31:21,582
Shenyuan,

627
00:31:23,063 --> 00:31:24,503
I was about to look for you.

628
00:31:24,943 --> 00:31:27,303
Has Wang Yuan confessed yet?

629
00:31:27,862 --> 00:31:29,662
He only ratted out some of the minions.

630
00:31:30,622 --> 00:31:31,662
This old geezer

631
00:31:32,543 --> 00:31:34,303
hasn't given up yet.

632
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:37,582
He's hoping

633
00:31:37,902 --> 00:31:38,783
that Lu Jiaxue

634
00:31:38,783 --> 00:31:39,703
will help him.

635
00:31:47,063 --> 00:31:48,303
Are you saying

636
00:31:48,783 --> 00:31:51,182
that Lu Jiaxue and Wang Yuan

637
00:31:51,582 --> 00:31:53,023
are in cahoots?

638
00:31:56,463 --> 00:31:57,382
That's unlikely.

639
00:31:58,902 --> 00:32:01,503
Lu Jiaxue is a general

640
00:32:02,896 --> 00:32:04,380
who earned credit from fighting wars.

641
00:32:04,382 --> 00:32:07,382
He wouldn't defect to the enemy.

642
00:32:09,182 --> 00:32:10,303
He may not

643
00:32:11,503 --> 00:32:12,622
defect to the enemy,

644
00:32:12,822 --> 00:32:14,582
but he was involved in smuggling.

645
00:32:17,023 --> 00:32:18,422
Do you remember

646
00:32:18,943 --> 00:32:20,102
Chen Daoyan's death?

647
00:32:20,463 --> 00:32:21,703
You told me before.

648
00:32:22,622 --> 00:32:23,743
Lu Jiaxue

649
00:32:24,102 --> 00:32:26,783
was afraid that the reopening
of Chen Jiuheng's case

650
00:32:26,902 --> 00:32:28,743
would reveal his involvement
in smuggling.

651
00:32:28,743 --> 00:32:29,503
That's why

652
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,660
he attempted to eliminate
all your seniors and juniors.

653
00:32:31,943 --> 00:32:32,743
Back then,

654
00:32:32,902 --> 00:32:34,822
you were trying so hard

655
00:32:34,902 --> 00:32:37,422
to protect Chen Daoyan.

656
00:32:39,303 --> 00:32:40,703
But

657
00:32:41,342 --> 00:32:44,743
those villains were ruthless.

658
00:32:45,182 --> 00:32:46,342
It's a shame

659
00:32:46,902 --> 00:32:49,662
that Lu Jiaxue destroyed
Wang Yuan's smuggling ships

660
00:32:49,902 --> 00:32:52,142
using Yang Ling as an excuse.

661
00:32:52,582 --> 00:32:54,822
All the evidence was gone.

662
00:32:56,142 --> 00:32:57,662
Knowing Wang Yuan,

663
00:32:58,382 --> 00:32:59,743
he'll definitely have a backup plan.

664
00:33:03,182 --> 00:33:04,023
Backup plan?

665
00:33:04,303 --> 00:33:05,422
Do you mean

666
00:33:05,422 --> 00:33:07,422
if he does,

667
00:33:07,662 --> 00:33:09,862
you want him to surrender

668
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:11,142
the evidence

669
00:33:11,263 --> 00:33:12,902
to prove his collusion with Lu Jiaxue

670
00:33:12,902 --> 00:33:14,463
to bring the latter down?

671
00:33:15,783 --> 00:33:17,063
We'll have to see

672
00:33:17,503 --> 00:33:18,822
if Wang Yuan is smart enough.

673
00:33:22,503 --> 00:33:23,342
Interesting.

674
00:33:26,063 --> 00:33:27,263
What brings you to me

675
00:33:27,263 --> 00:33:28,142
today?

676
00:33:31,902 --> 00:33:33,182
I would like

677
00:33:34,422 --> 00:33:35,662
to propose marriage to Yining.

678
00:33:44,662 --> 00:33:46,063
My focus

679
00:33:46,063 --> 00:33:48,263
is on Wang Yuan's case.

680
00:33:48,263 --> 00:33:49,263
Unless this case concludes,

681
00:33:49,382 --> 00:33:50,463
I don't want to be concerned

682
00:33:50,463 --> 00:33:51,662
by other matters.

683
00:33:52,382 --> 00:33:53,902
Understood, Duke Ying.

684
00:33:54,222 --> 00:33:56,347
(Imperial Court of Judicial)

685
00:34:06,303 --> 00:34:07,182
You may leave.

686
00:34:14,903 --> 00:34:16,262
I don't think

687
00:34:16,383 --> 00:34:17,142
you bring me here

688
00:34:17,142 --> 00:34:19,102
just to watch you drink tea.

689
00:34:21,983 --> 00:34:23,742
In the past, you were powerful.

690
00:34:24,343 --> 00:34:26,503
Everything that happened in the capital

691
00:34:27,222 --> 00:34:28,662
couldn't escape your monitor.

692
00:34:30,302 --> 00:34:32,463
We both know each other well.

693
00:34:32,662 --> 00:34:35,503
Just cut right to the chase.

694
00:34:38,063 --> 00:34:39,102
The evidence is conclusive.

695
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:40,302
You can be convicted

696
00:34:40,543 --> 00:34:42,063
of a crime at any time.

697
00:34:42,736 --> 00:34:44,100
There's nothing much to question.

698
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,662
Then, why did you come here?

699
00:34:49,823 --> 00:34:51,503
You're stalling time

700
00:34:51,782 --> 00:34:52,943
to wait for Lu Jiaxue

701
00:34:52,943 --> 00:34:54,182
to get you out.

702
00:34:54,503 --> 00:34:56,419
But nothing has changed now.

703
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,600
Instead of sitting idly by,

704
00:34:57,702 --> 00:34:59,023
why don't you make a move?

705
00:34:59,423 --> 00:35:01,222
You should know this better than I do.

706
00:35:01,503 --> 00:35:04,102
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

707
00:35:06,222 --> 00:35:07,302
It's fine.

708
00:35:08,096 --> 00:35:09,700
As long as I hand over you
to His Majesty,

709
00:35:09,943 --> 00:35:11,503
it's a great merit for me.

710
00:35:13,622 --> 00:35:14,662
However,

711
00:35:14,903 --> 00:35:16,142
you'll be

712
00:35:16,142 --> 00:35:17,142
under my control by then

713
00:35:17,142 --> 00:35:18,782
without turning back.

714
00:35:19,662 --> 00:35:21,503
What exactly do you want?

715
00:35:22,142 --> 00:35:23,463
The name list of your faction.

716
00:35:31,903 --> 00:35:32,702
Stand right there.

717
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,420
Why are you arresting me?

718
00:35:35,423 --> 00:35:35,742
Move.

719
00:35:36,302 --> 00:35:38,742
I want to seek an audience
with His Majesty.

720
00:35:41,903 --> 00:35:42,782
Come on and drink.

721
00:35:43,943 --> 00:35:45,503
It's him. Take him away.

722
00:35:45,863 --> 00:35:47,142
Scoundrel! Who are you?

723
00:35:47,142 --> 00:35:47,503
Move.

724
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:49,302
Who ordered you to arrest me?

725
00:35:49,302 --> 00:35:50,142
Let go of me!

726
00:35:50,142 --> 00:35:51,343
Who sent you?

727
00:35:51,343 --> 00:35:52,383
Let go of me!

728
00:36:01,503 --> 00:36:03,102
It's him. Take him away.

729
00:36:03,182 --> 00:36:04,222
Who are you?

730
00:36:04,582 --> 00:36:06,343
Let go of me!

731
00:36:07,742 --> 00:36:08,983
How dare you!

732
00:36:09,262 --> 00:36:10,063
Let go!

733
00:36:15,343 --> 00:36:15,983
Your Lordship,

734
00:36:16,182 --> 00:36:17,063
Wang Yuan has confessed

735
00:36:17,063 --> 00:36:18,742
Vice Minister Li and those officials.

736
00:36:18,863 --> 00:36:20,423
Could the next one be...

737
00:36:26,983 --> 00:36:27,863
Let go!

738
00:36:28,782 --> 00:36:29,702
Let go!

739
00:36:30,622 --> 00:36:32,423
Who are you to arrest me?

740
00:36:32,423 --> 00:36:33,262
Quiet.

741
00:36:33,463 --> 00:36:34,863
What are you trying to do?

742
00:36:35,102 --> 00:36:36,222
What are you doing?

743
00:36:36,582 --> 00:36:38,823
Let go of me right now!

744
00:36:39,302 --> 00:36:40,823
Why are you arresting me?

745
00:36:40,823 --> 00:36:42,102
Let go of me!

746
00:36:43,063 --> 00:36:45,463
Well, well. Lu Jiaxue.

747
00:36:47,102 --> 00:36:49,222
You should be losing your patience
by now.

748
00:36:49,847 --> 00:36:51,988
(Wangyue Hall)

749
00:37:15,863 --> 00:37:16,662
Young Master,

750
00:37:16,863 --> 00:37:18,343
Lu Jiaxue enters the palace as expected.

751
00:37:18,983 --> 00:37:21,023
We've driven him to the corner.

752
00:37:21,142 --> 00:37:22,302
He went to the palace now

753
00:37:22,503 --> 00:37:24,142
to save his own life.

754
00:37:24,182 --> 00:37:24,903
Do you mean

755
00:37:24,903 --> 00:37:26,702
he's going to accuse Wang Yuan

756
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:27,662
to keep himself safe?

757
00:37:27,903 --> 00:37:29,343
Will His Majesty believe him?

758
00:37:29,662 --> 00:37:30,863
This is a scheme for years.

759
00:37:31,423 --> 00:37:32,823
He certainly has a backup plan.

760
00:37:32,823 --> 00:37:33,662
It won't be easy

761
00:37:33,662 --> 00:37:34,903
to bring him down.

762
00:37:35,136 --> 00:37:36,180
By the way, Young Master.

763
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:37,200
I also heard that Duke Ying

764
00:37:37,232 --> 00:37:38,288
was summoned to the palace.

765
00:37:39,343 --> 00:37:40,142
When?

766
00:37:40,343 --> 00:37:41,903
Not long after Lu Jiaxue went.

767
00:37:43,142 --> 00:37:45,463
Young Master, why did His Majesty

768
00:37:45,504 --> 00:37:46,272
summon Duke Ying

769
00:37:46,272 --> 00:37:47,890
if Lu Jiaxue was there
to accuse Wang Yuan?

770
00:37:54,343 --> 00:37:55,543
Lu Jiaxue enters the palace

771
00:37:56,543 --> 00:37:57,543
not to save his own life

772
00:37:58,742 --> 00:38:00,423
but to ask to marry Yining.

773
00:38:11,063 --> 00:38:12,182
Hold on, Duke Ying.

774
00:38:15,102 --> 00:38:15,903
Marquis Lu,

775
00:38:16,463 --> 00:38:17,582
what's the matter?

776
00:38:18,102 --> 00:38:18,903
Oh, right.

777
00:38:19,102 --> 00:38:20,702
I forgot to congratulate you.

778
00:38:20,863 --> 00:38:22,102
It's a big merit

779
00:38:22,262 --> 00:38:23,702
to accuse Wang Yuan.

780
00:38:23,702 --> 00:38:26,102
But to my surprise,

781
00:38:26,383 --> 00:38:27,823
you and Wang Yuan

782
00:38:28,063 --> 00:38:29,662
are connected in that way.

783
00:38:30,262 --> 00:38:31,302
Please pardon me.

784
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,560
I've already explained this

785
00:38:32,823 --> 00:38:34,622
to His Majesty.

786
00:38:34,782 --> 00:38:35,943
Wang Yuan tried

787
00:38:36,182 --> 00:38:38,023
to get me on his side
for the smuggling business.

788
00:38:38,048 --> 00:38:39,424
I pretended to collaborate with him

789
00:38:39,456 --> 00:38:40,540
to gain his trust

790
00:38:40,662 --> 00:38:41,503
with the aim

791
00:38:41,823 --> 00:38:44,543
of thoroughly investigating
all the officials

792
00:38:44,543 --> 00:38:45,622
involved in smuggling.

793
00:38:46,343 --> 00:38:47,142
Besides,

794
00:38:47,142 --> 00:38:48,983
I've already surrendered all the profits

795
00:38:49,142 --> 00:38:50,582
from Wang Yuan's smuggling business.

796
00:38:51,142 --> 00:38:51,702
Can't I

797
00:38:51,702 --> 00:38:53,063
still earn your trust?

798
00:38:53,262 --> 00:38:54,463
As the matter stands,

799
00:38:54,903 --> 00:38:56,983
does my trust even matter?

800
00:39:00,023 --> 00:39:01,102
It seems you have

801
00:39:01,302 --> 00:39:02,742
some misunderstanding about me.

802
00:39:03,302 --> 00:39:05,503
That's why you rejected

803
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:07,376
His Majesty's marriage appointment.

804
00:39:07,742 --> 00:39:08,863
I don't understand

805
00:39:09,102 --> 00:39:10,662
why you would choose

806
00:39:10,903 --> 00:39:11,782
my daughter

807
00:39:12,543 --> 00:39:13,903
out of so many noble ladies

808
00:39:13,903 --> 00:39:15,063
in the capital.

809
00:39:21,662 --> 00:39:23,383
Because I truly like Yining.

810
00:39:24,503 --> 00:39:26,423
I want to marry her and treat her well.

811
00:39:27,063 --> 00:39:27,943
Unfortunately,

812
00:39:28,503 --> 00:39:30,503
Yining and Vice Minster Luo

813
00:39:30,672 --> 00:39:32,100
have been engaged for a long time.

814
00:39:33,782 --> 00:39:35,662
We can't accept your proposal.

815
00:39:36,782 --> 00:39:38,499
Are you aware that deceiving the Emperor

816
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,304
can lead to the execution
of your entire clan?

817
00:39:41,102 --> 00:39:41,943
Duke Ying,

818
00:39:42,702 --> 00:39:43,863
you and I

819
00:39:44,063 --> 00:39:45,503
know about the engagement.

820
00:39:46,543 --> 00:39:47,423
If you don't believe me,

821
00:39:47,863 --> 00:39:49,302
you can go and ask around.

822
00:39:49,823 --> 00:39:50,863
Their wedding

823
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,622
will be held next month.

824
00:39:59,662 --> 00:40:00,262
Duke Ying.

825
00:40:16,063 --> 00:40:16,863
When did Yining

826
00:40:16,863 --> 00:40:18,222
become betrothed to you?

827
00:40:18,543 --> 00:40:20,142
When she was in the Luo's Residence,

828
00:40:20,383 --> 00:40:21,622
my grandma arranged

829
00:40:21,622 --> 00:40:22,622
this marriage.

830
00:40:22,702 --> 00:40:23,662
We were still young,

831
00:40:23,702 --> 00:40:25,023
so no one mentioned it.

832
00:40:25,343 --> 00:40:26,463
Now that she's grown,

833
00:40:26,782 --> 00:40:27,903
we can bring it up again.

834
00:40:31,582 --> 00:40:32,463
So

835
00:40:32,463 --> 00:40:34,142
this is what you told Duke Ying to say.

836
00:40:34,662 --> 00:40:36,463
You put Duke Ying

837
00:40:36,503 --> 00:40:37,662
at grave risk

838
00:40:38,903 --> 00:40:40,543
for your own benefit.

839
00:40:41,262 --> 00:40:41,943
If Yining finds out

840
00:40:41,943 --> 00:40:43,142
what kind of person you are,

841
00:40:43,383 --> 00:40:44,463
would she still marry you?

842
00:40:44,662 --> 00:40:46,782
Well, I don't get it.

843
00:40:47,543 --> 00:40:49,302
The crime of deceiving the Emperor

844
00:40:49,343 --> 00:40:50,983
is too serious

845
00:40:51,302 --> 00:40:52,582
for Duke Ying and me.

846
00:40:53,222 --> 00:40:55,142
If there's nothing else,
I'll take my leave.

847
00:41:00,304 --> 00:41:01,639
(Huanjing Pavilion)

848
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:02,384
Yining.

849
00:41:07,102 --> 00:41:07,903
Father,

850
00:41:08,503 --> 00:41:10,182
for what urgent matter did His Majesty

851
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:12,000
summon you to the palace
this morning?

852
00:41:14,302 --> 00:41:17,222
His Majesty appointed a marriage to you.

853
00:41:17,702 --> 00:41:18,503
A marriage?

854
00:41:19,262 --> 00:41:21,503
Why would His Majesty do that?

855
00:41:21,983 --> 00:41:23,222
Who am I appointed to?

856
00:41:23,302 --> 00:41:24,102
Let's talk inside.

857
00:41:28,582 --> 00:41:29,383
Yining,

858
00:41:30,383 --> 00:41:31,383
there's something

859
00:41:31,582 --> 00:41:32,582
I've wanted to ask you,

860
00:41:32,582 --> 00:41:33,983
but I didn't.

861
00:41:34,182 --> 00:41:35,503
You have to tell me the truth.

862
00:41:37,343 --> 00:41:39,383
You rarely met

863
00:41:39,383 --> 00:41:40,662
Lu Jiaxue.

864
00:41:40,662 --> 00:41:42,582
Why does he always pester you?

865
00:41:45,662 --> 00:41:46,463
He and I

866
00:41:47,742 --> 00:41:49,863
met when I was in the side yard.

867
00:41:50,582 --> 00:41:51,383
At the time,

868
00:41:51,582 --> 00:41:53,142
I thought we truly loved each other.

869
00:41:54,142 --> 00:41:56,622
But in fact, I mistrusted him.

870
00:41:57,782 --> 00:41:59,222
Do you still have feelings for him?

871
00:41:59,343 --> 00:42:00,182
No.

872
00:42:00,182 --> 00:42:00,943
Are you sure?

873
00:42:01,383 --> 00:42:02,182
I am.

874
00:42:05,302 --> 00:42:06,543
In that case, I have no worries.

875
00:42:07,222 --> 00:42:08,023
Here's the thing.

876
00:42:08,343 --> 00:42:10,423
Today, Lu Jiaxue

877
00:42:10,423 --> 00:42:12,142
accused a criminal

878
00:42:12,543 --> 00:42:15,543
and requested a marriage with you
from His Majesty.

879
00:42:15,622 --> 00:42:17,622
His Majesty

880
00:42:17,622 --> 00:42:19,102
appreciated me

881
00:42:19,503 --> 00:42:21,302
and asked for my opinion.

882
00:42:22,102 --> 00:42:24,383
I told His Majesty that...

883
00:42:24,742 --> 00:42:25,863
I said...

884
00:42:27,903 --> 00:42:28,943
What did you say?

885
00:42:29,863 --> 00:42:32,423
I said Luo Shenyuan and you

886
00:42:32,662 --> 00:42:34,142
have been betrothed to each other.

887
00:42:35,142 --> 00:42:36,742
That's great, Father.

888
00:42:38,863 --> 00:42:39,662
But

889
00:42:40,302 --> 00:42:42,662
does that mean deceiving the Emperor?

890
00:42:42,823 --> 00:42:43,622
Right.

891
00:42:44,102 --> 00:42:45,943
But it was an urgent situation.

892
00:42:45,943 --> 00:42:46,463
I know

893
00:42:46,463 --> 00:42:48,102
you don't like Lu Jiaxue.

894
00:42:48,102 --> 00:42:48,782
I can't

895
00:42:48,782 --> 00:42:50,543
watch you jump into a fire pit.

896
00:42:50,543 --> 00:42:52,262
Did His Majesty believe what you said?

897
00:42:52,302 --> 00:42:53,102
Yes.

898
00:42:53,423 --> 00:42:54,863
Luckily, I reacted smartly.

899
00:42:55,423 --> 00:42:56,423
I told His Majesty

900
00:42:56,823 --> 00:42:58,423
that you were in the Luo's Residence,

901
00:42:58,423 --> 00:42:59,222
and Old Madam Luo

902
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,510
arranged a marriage for you both

903
00:43:00,512 --> 00:43:01,660
when you were kids.

904
00:43:01,782 --> 00:43:02,782
But you were too young,

905
00:43:02,863 --> 00:43:04,823
so nobody knew about it.

906
00:43:07,142 --> 00:43:07,943
However,

907
00:43:08,622 --> 00:43:10,543
that's too easy for Luo Shenyuan.

908
00:43:10,622 --> 00:43:13,102
I wanted to test him more.
