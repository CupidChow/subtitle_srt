=The Rise of Ning=

2
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,320
(Adapted from Wen Tan's novel "Chancellor
Training Handbook" from Jinjiang Literature)

3
00:01:36,493 --> 00:01:38,726
=Episode 16=

4
00:01:39,504 --> 00:01:41,800
Second Uncle wouldn't even let him
enter the home academy.

5
00:01:42,285 --> 00:01:43,404
How could Luo Shenyuan...

6
00:01:43,404 --> 00:01:44,884
Pay no attention to others.

7
00:01:45,645 --> 00:01:46,365
You

8
00:01:46,604 --> 00:01:47,964
just need to think about

9
00:01:48,285 --> 00:01:50,285
why you couldn't write good poems

10
00:01:50,285 --> 00:01:51,125
despite the efforts

11
00:01:51,125 --> 00:01:52,324
Mother put in for you.

12
00:01:52,444 --> 00:01:53,765
My dear sister,

13
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,520
literature isn't my ambition.

14
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,320
If it were about martial
or military knowledge,

15
00:01:57,328 --> 00:01:58,600
I'd triumph over everyone.

16
00:02:00,645 --> 00:02:01,444
Shanyuan.

17
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:05,684
Yiyu.

18
00:02:06,964 --> 00:02:08,284
Your guzheng playing earlier today

19
00:02:08,445 --> 00:02:09,925
was elegant and refined.

20
00:02:10,124 --> 00:02:11,605
Even a fairy musician

21
00:02:11,684 --> 00:02:13,244
couldn't compare to you.

22
00:02:14,124 --> 00:02:15,284
Thank you for your compliment.

23
00:02:17,296 --> 00:02:18,560
We haven't met in a few days.

24
00:02:19,404 --> 00:02:21,724
You seem to be cold toward me.

25
00:02:24,605 --> 00:02:26,804
Are you drunk, Mr. Cheng?

26
00:02:26,964 --> 00:02:28,925
We are merely connected
through our elders.

27
00:02:29,445 --> 00:02:30,804
We are not that familiar.

28
00:02:30,964 --> 00:02:32,485
Why would you say that, Mr. Cheng?

29
00:02:32,765 --> 00:02:33,564
Also,

30
00:02:33,885 --> 00:02:36,325
please stop saying things

31
00:02:36,605 --> 00:02:38,605
like the fairy musician anymore.

32
00:02:38,724 --> 00:02:40,964
People might

33
00:02:41,724 --> 00:02:42,844
misunderstand it.

34
00:02:46,804 --> 00:02:47,605
Shan,

35
00:02:47,724 --> 00:02:49,085
Yixiu isn't feeling well.

36
00:02:49,325 --> 00:02:50,124
Mother wants us

37
00:02:50,124 --> 00:02:51,284
to return to look after her.

38
00:03:00,955 --> 00:03:01,959
To think

39
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,584
that the Luo's Residence
illegitimate son

40
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:05,564
will soon rise to fame in the capital.

41
00:03:05,964 --> 00:03:07,445
He has such great patience.

42
00:03:08,284 --> 00:03:10,925
The third son of the Luo Family
is not someone to be trifled with.

43
00:03:15,564 --> 00:03:16,325
Seventh Lady.

44
00:03:25,124 --> 00:03:26,765
Your pipa playing earlier

45
00:03:27,085 --> 00:03:29,124
doesn't seem to have been taught
by a female master.

46
00:03:29,765 --> 00:03:31,885
What do you mean, Marquis Lu?

47
00:03:32,165 --> 00:03:33,645
Such ferocious ambiance

48
00:03:34,085 --> 00:03:35,445
shouldn't belong to a woman.

49
00:03:36,564 --> 00:03:38,599
Have you not heard

50
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,448
about the story
of Lady Duchess of Qiao State?

51
00:03:40,684 --> 00:03:41,964
Female generals

52
00:03:41,964 --> 00:03:43,964
haven't been a rare occurrence
since ancient times.

53
00:03:44,124 --> 00:03:45,244
Also, the ferocious ambiance

54
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:46,885
is not exclusive to men.

55
00:03:47,085 --> 00:03:48,844
What a spirit, Seventh Lady.

56
00:03:49,124 --> 00:03:50,844
Ladies usually play songs

57
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:53,165
that are peaceful and elegant.

58
00:03:53,404 --> 00:03:55,284
You played a song
with such profound sadness

59
00:03:56,564 --> 00:03:58,684
as if you had experienced it yourself.

60
00:04:00,964 --> 00:04:03,445
Is that a compliment, Marquis Lu?

61
00:04:10,724 --> 00:04:12,724
If that's not your favorite song,

62
00:04:12,804 --> 00:04:14,244
you better not play it.

63
00:04:15,284 --> 00:04:16,364
Isn't that too much to ask,

64
00:04:16,364 --> 00:04:17,445
Marquis Lu?

65
00:04:17,885 --> 00:04:19,645
Whether I like it or play it

66
00:04:19,964 --> 00:04:21,484
has nothing to do with you.

67
00:04:23,964 --> 00:04:26,125
The Literary Feast has ended.

68
00:04:26,205 --> 00:04:28,125
You may take your leave soon

69
00:04:28,164 --> 00:04:29,964
as you have many official duties
at hand.

70
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:31,964
Are you trying to send me away?

71
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:33,005
I wouldn't dare.

72
00:04:33,164 --> 00:04:35,565
The Luo's Residence
has a century-old garden,

73
00:04:36,085 --> 00:04:38,284
but I suppose it holds
no interest for you.

74
00:04:40,484 --> 00:04:42,805
I need to go return gifts to the guests.

75
00:04:42,924 --> 00:04:44,044
Please excuse me.

76
00:04:51,044 --> 00:04:51,844
Your Lordship,

77
00:04:52,565 --> 00:04:53,645
is Seventh Lady

78
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,136
the person you have been looking for?

79
00:04:57,164 --> 00:04:57,964
She's like her,

80
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:00,245
but not entirely.

81
00:05:03,284 --> 00:05:04,964
By the way, any luck with Chen Daoyan?

82
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:06,964
Not yet.

83
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:09,964
Come with me.

84
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,321
(As humble as hollow bamboo)

85
00:05:13,284 --> 00:05:14,245
Be gentle with it.

86
00:05:16,565 --> 00:05:17,199
Congratulations.

87
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,160
These are precious.

88
00:05:18,176 --> 00:05:19,000
Put them to...

89
00:05:19,005 --> 00:05:20,760
Congratulations on seeking
a great apprenticeship.

90
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,120
This Literary Feast is a success.

91
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,604
I didn't expect to see

92
00:05:23,604 --> 00:05:24,685
such a fruitful occasion

93
00:05:24,685 --> 00:05:25,924
after so many years.

94
00:05:25,924 --> 00:05:28,164
This is truly rare.

95
00:05:28,164 --> 00:05:29,765
It's all thanks to you, Mr. Sun.

96
00:05:29,765 --> 00:05:31,765
Not at all. Please stop here,

97
00:05:32,164 --> 00:05:33,005
Registrar Luo.

98
00:05:33,005 --> 00:05:34,964
Please wait a moment, Mr. Sun.

99
00:05:35,964 --> 00:05:36,765
Butler Bai.

100
00:05:37,604 --> 00:05:38,364
Yes.

101
00:05:42,645 --> 00:05:44,125
Your Lordship, this chest of gifts

102
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:45,805
seems a bit suspicious.

103
00:05:47,245 --> 00:05:48,044
Examine the chest.

104
00:05:49,325 --> 00:05:50,125
Yes.

105
00:05:53,685 --> 00:05:54,565
No.

106
00:05:54,565 --> 00:05:56,364
No, Registrar Luo.

107
00:05:57,205 --> 00:05:59,724
Mr. Sun, these are
some writing supplies.

108
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,152
It's a small token of appreciation.

109
00:06:01,284 --> 00:06:02,125
Registrar Luo,

110
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:03,685
attending the Literary Feast

111
00:06:03,685 --> 00:06:05,085
has been a great pleasure for me,

112
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:06,885
as for this...

113
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:09,125
Mr. Sun, to be honest,

114
00:06:09,284 --> 00:06:11,964
my mother was glad to hear

115
00:06:12,085 --> 00:06:14,325
that you accept students

116
00:06:14,604 --> 00:06:16,765
regardless of their status
and refuse gifts.

117
00:06:17,056 --> 00:06:18,280
This is just a small gesture.

118
00:06:18,604 --> 00:06:20,924
Please accept it.

119
00:06:21,724 --> 00:06:22,805
In that case,

120
00:06:22,964 --> 00:06:24,325
I will accept this.

121
00:06:24,724 --> 00:06:26,284
I shall thank Old Madam Luo

122
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,720
on behalf of students from humble roots.

123
00:06:31,072 --> 00:06:32,768
Hurry and carry it to the carriage.

124
00:06:34,724 --> 00:06:36,445
I will take my leave, Registrar Luo.

125
00:06:36,765 --> 00:06:38,445
Take care, Mr. Sun.

126
00:06:38,924 --> 00:06:39,364
Hold on!

127
00:06:51,565 --> 00:06:52,085
I apologize

128
00:06:53,125 --> 00:06:55,125
for startling you,
Mr. Sun and Second Master Luo.

129
00:06:55,484 --> 00:06:56,284
Commander Ye,

130
00:06:56,284 --> 00:06:58,964
what is this about?

131
00:06:59,604 --> 00:07:01,284
There's a criminal at large.

132
00:07:01,328 --> 00:07:03,340
The Imperial Guards
have been ordered to arrest him.

133
00:07:03,404 --> 00:07:04,765
Someone spotted

134
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,364
the criminal here,

135
00:07:06,645 --> 00:07:08,085
so Marquis Lu commanded us to search.

136
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:09,964
Please forgive us.

137
00:07:12,164 --> 00:07:14,805
Since this is an official duty,
please help yourself.

138
00:07:15,205 --> 00:07:16,484
This is my duty.

139
00:07:16,565 --> 00:07:17,325
Come.

140
00:07:17,325 --> 00:07:18,685
Open the chest.

141
00:07:18,685 --> 00:07:19,445
- Yes.
- Yes.

142
00:07:20,364 --> 00:07:21,164
Hold on.

143
00:07:25,364 --> 00:07:26,164
Commander Ye,

144
00:07:26,805 --> 00:07:27,844
this chest

145
00:07:28,164 --> 00:07:31,125
is a gift we return to Mr. Sun.

146
00:07:31,805 --> 00:07:32,685
Commander Ye,

147
00:07:32,724 --> 00:07:34,284
this chest contains the writing supplies

148
00:07:34,284 --> 00:07:36,325
Old Madam Luo gave me.

149
00:07:36,685 --> 00:07:38,805
I think it should be all right.

150
00:07:38,805 --> 00:07:39,645
Mr. Sun,

151
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:41,604
this is my duty.

152
00:07:41,604 --> 00:07:43,125
I wouldn't dare overlook anything.

153
00:07:43,364 --> 00:07:45,044
These are elegant objects.

154
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:46,085
How could you...

155
00:07:46,404 --> 00:07:47,765
This is humiliating.

156
00:07:47,765 --> 00:07:48,565
Please pardon me.

157
00:07:48,604 --> 00:07:49,645
You dare defy me?

158
00:07:49,645 --> 00:07:50,279
Search!

159
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:50,864
How dare you!

160
00:07:50,864 --> 00:07:51,640
Don't be rude.

161
00:08:00,645 --> 00:08:01,724
Greetings, Marquis Lu.

162
00:08:04,604 --> 00:08:05,604
Please pardon

163
00:08:05,645 --> 00:08:06,964
their disrespectful actions.

164
00:08:07,805 --> 00:08:08,645
Marquis Lu,

165
00:08:09,484 --> 00:08:10,565
your subordinate

166
00:08:10,765 --> 00:08:12,445
is very diligent.

167
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,005
We are decreed

168
00:08:14,005 --> 00:08:16,164
to capture the criminal.

169
00:08:16,484 --> 00:08:18,844
I'm doing this in regard to laws.

170
00:08:18,964 --> 00:08:19,924
I'm truly sorry.

171
00:08:19,924 --> 00:08:22,284
Marquis Lu, this chest

172
00:08:22,445 --> 00:08:23,885
only contains writing supplies.

173
00:08:24,284 --> 00:08:24,964
It's better not

174
00:08:24,964 --> 00:08:26,284
to ruin such an elegant gesture.

175
00:08:26,484 --> 00:08:27,724
They certainly are elegant,

176
00:08:28,685 --> 00:08:29,805
but the one who ruins them

177
00:08:29,924 --> 00:08:31,164
isn't me.

178
00:08:31,325 --> 00:08:32,724
I'm also

179
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,124
protecting your reputation, Mr. Sun.

180
00:08:35,124 --> 00:08:36,964
What will you do if you don't

181
00:08:37,724 --> 00:08:38,805
find the criminal inside?

182
00:08:38,925 --> 00:08:41,364
If that's the case,
I will send you a gift of apology.

183
00:08:44,045 --> 00:08:44,844
Come.

184
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:45,964
Yes.

185
00:08:46,805 --> 00:08:47,405
Open the chest.

186
00:08:47,604 --> 00:08:47,884
Yes.

187
00:09:13,964 --> 00:09:15,085
It would be better not

188
00:09:16,124 --> 00:09:18,165
to open the chest
and sabotage this elegance.

189
00:09:19,925 --> 00:09:21,244
Pay no mind to my impudence.

190
00:09:21,405 --> 00:09:22,604
Please pardon me, Mr. Sun.

191
00:09:22,685 --> 00:09:24,085
This is ridiculous.

192
00:09:34,928 --> 00:09:36,280
I bid you farewell, Marquis Lu.

193
00:09:37,484 --> 00:09:38,565
Please see your way out.

194
00:09:42,592 --> 00:09:44,680
We have plenty of time ahead,
Third Young Master Luo.

195
00:09:54,124 --> 00:09:54,925
Your Lordship.

196
00:09:56,205 --> 00:09:57,004
How was it?

197
00:09:57,644 --> 00:09:58,925
I followed Sun Jie's carriage

198
00:09:58,925 --> 00:09:59,964
to the academy

199
00:10:00,205 --> 00:10:01,724
and watched them unloading all the gifts

200
00:10:01,724 --> 00:10:02,759
until the carriage left.

201
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,096
We didn't find anything suspicious.

202
00:10:04,124 --> 00:10:05,004
All guests and carriages

203
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:05,964
leaving Luo Residence

204
00:10:06,004 --> 00:10:07,445
were thoroughly searched.

205
00:10:09,805 --> 00:10:10,565
Aside from Sun Jie,

206
00:10:10,565 --> 00:10:12,085
did the Luo's Residence return gifts

207
00:10:12,565 --> 00:10:14,244
to anyone else?

208
00:10:14,884 --> 00:10:15,604
Return gifts?

209
00:10:16,672 --> 00:10:18,320
They returned gifts
to Cheng's Residence.

210
00:10:18,325 --> 00:10:19,124
It's said

211
00:10:19,184 --> 00:10:20,880
that Mr. Cheng brought
plenty of fine gifts

212
00:10:20,884 --> 00:10:22,045
to Luo's Residence.

213
00:10:22,124 --> 00:10:23,124
This time,

214
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:24,124
they also returned

215
00:10:24,124 --> 00:10:25,405
a few chests of gifts

216
00:10:25,405 --> 00:10:26,205
to Mr. Cheng.

217
00:10:26,205 --> 00:10:28,484
Did you search
their carriages thoroughly?

218
00:10:28,484 --> 00:10:29,805
I ordered them

219
00:10:29,805 --> 00:10:31,325
to search all the carriages.

220
00:10:31,925 --> 00:10:34,445
However, concerning
Mr. Cheng's relationship with you,

221
00:10:34,685 --> 00:10:35,439
they wouldn't dare

222
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,928
disturb the Cheng's Residence carriage.

223
00:10:39,124 --> 00:10:39,805
Careless.

224
00:10:40,325 --> 00:10:41,484
Are you saying

225
00:10:41,685 --> 00:10:44,165
that the man left together
with Cheng Residence's carriage?

226
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:45,760
I will send my men to pursue him.

227
00:10:45,884 --> 00:10:47,445
No need. It's already late.

228
00:10:47,925 --> 00:10:49,884
Be that as it may,
just as I expected,

229
00:10:50,445 --> 00:10:51,244
we are up against

230
00:10:51,244 --> 00:10:52,964
a rival to be reckoned with.

231
00:10:53,285 --> 00:10:54,285
It seems

232
00:10:54,884 --> 00:10:55,964
I have underestimated him.

233
00:10:59,843 --> 00:11:01,876
(Cheng)

234
00:11:02,285 --> 00:11:03,124
Come

235
00:11:03,124 --> 00:11:04,364
and unload the chests.

236
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,200
(Cheng)

237
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,600
(Jimo House)

238
00:11:20,976 --> 00:11:22,240
Congratulations, Third Brother.

239
00:11:22,285 --> 00:11:23,604
You made an impression today.

240
00:11:23,644 --> 00:11:26,124
You will surely achieve your goal
in the future.

241
00:11:26,964 --> 00:11:28,805
I believe Senior Daoyan

242
00:11:28,805 --> 00:11:30,445
must've escaped by now.

243
00:11:31,285 --> 00:11:32,285
For this,

244
00:11:32,285 --> 00:11:33,925
I must thank you, Seventh Sister,

245
00:11:33,925 --> 00:11:34,964
and Qing Qu.

246
00:11:36,085 --> 00:11:37,484
My brilliant mind

247
00:11:37,484 --> 00:11:38,884
is certainly because of

248
00:11:39,085 --> 00:11:40,925
my intelligent third brother.

249
00:11:43,805 --> 00:11:44,604
Of course,

250
00:11:44,644 --> 00:11:46,285
thanks to your strategy as well.

251
00:11:46,285 --> 00:11:48,644
Your prediction
of Lu Jiaxue's suspiciousness

252
00:11:48,685 --> 00:11:50,764
gave us this opportunity.

253
00:11:51,325 --> 00:11:52,124
Lu Jiaxue will

254
00:11:52,124 --> 00:11:53,565
figure it out sooner or later.

255
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:55,124
We can't fool him for so long.

256
00:11:55,325 --> 00:11:56,165
Do you suspect

257
00:11:56,644 --> 00:11:58,844
that he will target you?

258
00:11:59,004 --> 00:12:00,045
Well, he and I

259
00:12:00,925 --> 00:12:01,644
will eventually

260
00:12:01,644 --> 00:12:02,925
end up in a desperate fight.

261
00:12:03,325 --> 00:12:04,445
What I'm worried about is you.

262
00:12:06,004 --> 00:12:06,925
Me?

263
00:12:08,405 --> 00:12:09,604
Somehow,

264
00:12:10,364 --> 00:12:11,484
Lu Jiaxue

265
00:12:12,124 --> 00:12:13,565
is paying extra attention to you.

266
00:12:14,285 --> 00:12:16,445
Perhaps you played
"The Conqueror Disarms"

267
00:12:16,565 --> 00:12:17,685
too impressively.

268
00:12:20,604 --> 00:12:21,364
Maybe

269
00:12:21,925 --> 00:12:24,285
the song is filled with killing intent

270
00:12:25,205 --> 00:12:27,124
that resonates with him.

271
00:12:27,764 --> 00:12:29,325
That's why I caught his attention.

272
00:12:33,124 --> 00:12:33,925
If so,

273
00:12:33,925 --> 00:12:35,285
I won't play that song again.

274
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,640
By the way, Third Brother,

275
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:40,565
where

276
00:12:40,604 --> 00:12:41,685
did your senior hide

277
00:12:41,764 --> 00:12:42,844
when he was here?

278
00:12:52,325 --> 00:12:54,484
This is a secret chamber.

279
00:12:58,724 --> 00:12:59,484
Third Brother,

280
00:12:59,964 --> 00:13:02,364
what is this secret chamber for?

281
00:13:02,752 --> 00:13:03,760
Of course, it's to prevent

282
00:13:03,764 --> 00:13:05,165
another incident like today's.

283
00:13:06,124 --> 00:13:07,685
You are telling me now.

284
00:13:07,744 --> 00:13:09,360
Aren't you afraid
that I will tell others?

285
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:11,124
Aside from Shao'an,

286
00:13:11,405 --> 00:13:12,964
you are the one I trust the most.

287
00:13:13,124 --> 00:13:13,884
Ouch.

288
00:13:13,884 --> 00:13:14,884
So in your heart,

289
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,224
I'm not as important as Shao'an.

290
00:13:18,085 --> 00:13:19,364
Uh, let me put it this way.

291
00:13:20,405 --> 00:13:23,445
I trust no one more than you.

292
00:13:24,085 --> 00:13:25,165
That's better.

293
00:13:27,405 --> 00:13:28,205
Oh, right.

294
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:30,639
Ms. Zheng wrote back the other day,

295
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,272
saying that she would be returning soon.

296
00:13:34,484 --> 00:13:35,925
There are some things

297
00:13:37,085 --> 00:13:38,124
that should faced head-on

298
00:13:38,925 --> 00:13:40,124
rather than avoided.

299
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:42,244
Yining,

300
00:13:42,805 --> 00:13:43,644
trust me.

301
00:13:44,124 --> 00:13:45,165
I will stay with you

302
00:13:45,248 --> 00:13:46,800
through everything
you are going through.

303
00:13:50,897 --> 00:13:53,457
(Luo Residence)

304
00:14:17,085 --> 00:14:17,884
Father?

305
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:19,964
You are awake.

306
00:14:20,805 --> 00:14:22,445
The physician said you are fine,

307
00:14:22,644 --> 00:14:23,925
it was just exhaustion.

308
00:14:24,165 --> 00:14:24,964
It seems

309
00:14:25,925 --> 00:14:27,165
you have worked very hard

310
00:14:27,724 --> 00:14:29,805
for the Literary Feast.

311
00:14:30,165 --> 00:14:32,124
Thank... Thank you
for your consideration, Father.

312
00:14:32,964 --> 00:14:34,724
I couldn't sleep well

313
00:14:35,085 --> 00:14:36,325
these days,

314
00:14:36,925 --> 00:14:38,325
that's why I made a mistake.

315
00:14:38,325 --> 00:14:39,124
Shut it.

316
00:14:44,205 --> 00:14:45,644
Hardworking

317
00:14:45,884 --> 00:14:47,964
is the least a scholar should do.

318
00:14:48,205 --> 00:14:50,244
Going all out to study despite hardships

319
00:14:50,285 --> 00:14:51,685
is simply common.

320
00:14:53,644 --> 00:14:56,364
The literary gathering
is the battleground for scholars.

321
00:14:56,944 --> 00:14:58,360
You should charge forward bravely

322
00:14:58,685 --> 00:15:00,285
when confronting strong enemies.

323
00:15:00,644 --> 00:15:01,805
Yet you fled in fear.

324
00:15:01,805 --> 00:15:03,244
That's cowardice!

325
00:15:03,964 --> 00:15:04,644
Do you know

326
00:15:04,644 --> 00:15:05,604
that your behavior

327
00:15:05,964 --> 00:15:08,884
has made the Luo Family
a laughing stock?

328
00:15:12,925 --> 00:15:13,805
This is merely

329
00:15:13,805 --> 00:15:15,764
a small literary feast,

330
00:15:17,764 --> 00:15:19,445
but you couldn't even handle it.

331
00:15:19,764 --> 00:15:21,085
How are you going

332
00:15:22,464 --> 00:15:24,624
to deal with the upcoming
imperial examination?

333
00:15:25,004 --> 00:15:25,884
Tell me!

334
00:15:27,405 --> 00:15:30,244
I will definitely do my best

335
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:32,644
and not

336
00:15:33,644 --> 00:15:34,445
fail...

337
00:15:38,124 --> 00:15:39,285
I used to think

338
00:15:39,805 --> 00:15:40,925
that you were a driven person

339
00:15:40,964 --> 00:15:42,165
since you were a kid,

340
00:15:43,124 --> 00:15:44,325
but it turns out

341
00:15:45,285 --> 00:15:47,445
you are so immature.

342
00:15:51,445 --> 00:15:53,285
Useless fool.

343
00:15:57,445 --> 00:15:58,045
Father...

344
00:16:03,104 --> 00:16:04,680
Send for a physician to check on him.

345
00:16:09,085 --> 00:16:11,085
Are you all right, Xuan?

346
00:16:12,285 --> 00:16:13,244
You are the one to blame!

347
00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:18,285
You always urged me to study

348
00:16:18,565 --> 00:16:19,685
day and night,

349
00:16:20,124 --> 00:16:21,559
that's why I became nervous and made

350
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,136
a fool of myself
in front of many people.

351
00:16:23,184 --> 00:16:25,120
How could you say that?

352
00:16:25,644 --> 00:16:27,484
I'm doing this for your own good.

353
00:16:27,644 --> 00:16:28,764
For my own good?

354
00:16:29,285 --> 00:16:30,844
All you care about is yourself.

355
00:16:31,445 --> 00:16:33,124
I became a joke in the entire capital.

356
00:16:33,364 --> 00:16:34,124
Even that fellow

357
00:16:34,124 --> 00:16:35,445
from Jimo House

358
00:16:35,964 --> 00:16:37,445
outperformed me.

359
00:16:37,884 --> 00:16:38,925
Happy now?

360
00:16:42,285 --> 00:16:43,085
Xuan...

361
00:16:43,205 --> 00:16:44,124
Let me alone!

362
00:16:56,565 --> 00:16:57,285
That boy

363
00:16:57,285 --> 00:16:59,124
truly caught me off guard.

364
00:16:59,445 --> 00:17:01,844
This Luo Shenyuan is strange.

365
00:17:02,124 --> 00:17:03,124
How could he be able...

366
00:17:04,004 --> 00:17:05,124
I have noticed

367
00:17:05,456 --> 00:17:07,360
something different about him
a long time ago.

368
00:17:08,285 --> 00:17:10,124
He may be quiet

369
00:17:10,124 --> 00:17:11,364
and looks like a pushover,

370
00:17:11,485 --> 00:17:13,045
but his eyes

371
00:17:13,285 --> 00:17:14,965
give off a stubborn feeling.

372
00:17:15,364 --> 00:17:16,805
I just didn't expect him

373
00:17:16,884 --> 00:17:18,844
to hide his talent so deeply.

374
00:17:19,124 --> 00:17:20,765
He's just a lowly person

375
00:17:20,765 --> 00:17:22,124
who made up a nonsense poem.

376
00:17:22,285 --> 00:17:23,085
I don't think

377
00:17:23,085 --> 00:17:24,965
he's any better than Young Master Shan.

378
00:17:25,364 --> 00:17:26,844
Still, the second home

379
00:17:27,204 --> 00:17:28,285
got lucky

380
00:17:28,285 --> 00:17:29,444
at the literary feast this time.

381
00:17:29,805 --> 00:17:31,765
If Mr. Sun said it's good,

382
00:17:31,765 --> 00:17:32,924
then it's good.

383
00:17:33,404 --> 00:17:35,085
I just can't tolerate this.

384
00:17:35,164 --> 00:17:36,285
The second home

385
00:17:36,285 --> 00:17:38,444
has always had the upper hand
over these years.

386
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,920
It's merely because Second Master

387
00:17:39,924 --> 00:17:41,364
is an official in the capital,

388
00:17:41,444 --> 00:17:43,924
while First Master has been posted
outside the capital.

389
00:17:44,285 --> 00:17:45,844
I received news

390
00:17:46,164 --> 00:17:47,684
from my maternal family.

391
00:17:48,085 --> 00:17:48,884
First Master

392
00:17:50,204 --> 00:17:51,644
is soon returning to the capital.

393
00:17:51,965 --> 00:17:53,124
That's good.

394
00:17:54,085 --> 00:17:54,924
Madam Chen,

395
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:56,684
you no longer have

396
00:17:56,684 --> 00:17:57,805
to be alone

397
00:17:57,805 --> 00:17:58,965
and suffer quietly.

398
00:18:00,688 --> 00:18:03,815
(Haitang Abode)

399
00:18:08,644 --> 00:18:09,325
Young Lady,

400
00:18:09,325 --> 00:18:10,725
Qing Qu went to the gate to fetch her.

401
00:18:10,725 --> 00:18:12,085
They will be arriving soon.

402
00:18:16,924 --> 00:18:17,765
Ms. Zheng.

403
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:20,485
You're finally here.

404
00:18:20,805 --> 00:18:22,085
I have been waiting for you.

405
00:18:22,124 --> 00:18:23,444
Please come in.

406
00:18:29,325 --> 00:18:31,124
Ms. Zheng, there's no need
for formalities.

407
00:18:32,565 --> 00:18:34,285
You were with my mother
since she was little

408
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:35,444
and accompanied her

409
00:18:35,604 --> 00:18:36,679
to marry into this family

410
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,568
until she passed away.

411
00:18:37,765 --> 00:18:39,285
You don't have to bow to me.

412
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,164
When I left the Luo's Residence,

413
00:18:42,604 --> 00:18:44,325
you were a baby,

414
00:18:44,965 --> 00:18:45,765
but now

415
00:18:46,164 --> 00:18:47,965
you have already grown
into a young lady.

416
00:18:49,444 --> 00:18:50,684
Qing Qu wrote to me,

417
00:18:50,684 --> 00:18:52,045
saying that you are not feeling well.

418
00:18:52,124 --> 00:18:54,285
Allow me to check on you.

419
00:18:54,285 --> 00:18:55,045
Before this,

420
00:18:55,325 --> 00:18:57,045
let's visit Grandma.

421
00:18:58,364 --> 00:18:59,164
My apologies.

422
00:18:59,565 --> 00:19:01,164
I have already forgotten the rules.

423
00:19:01,364 --> 00:19:02,164
Yes, Young Lady.

424
00:19:03,805 --> 00:19:04,644
Grandma.

425
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:14,565
I, Zheng Rong, offer my greetings,
Old Madam.

426
00:19:15,164 --> 00:19:15,965
Get up.

427
00:19:17,005 --> 00:19:18,164
Thank you, Old Madam.

428
00:19:21,644 --> 00:19:22,684
It has been many years.

429
00:19:22,725 --> 00:19:25,085
How's your health?

430
00:19:25,444 --> 00:19:27,124
Indeed, it has been many years.

431
00:19:28,805 --> 00:19:30,285
I don't understand.

432
00:19:30,765 --> 00:19:32,604
Yining was just a baby that year,

433
00:19:33,124 --> 00:19:34,844
and you were the most capable

434
00:19:35,005 --> 00:19:37,725
and reliable maid besides Minglan.

435
00:19:37,765 --> 00:19:38,924
I implored you

436
00:19:38,924 --> 00:19:40,644
to stay to look after Yining,

437
00:19:41,005 --> 00:19:42,924
but you left the Luo's Residence

438
00:19:42,924 --> 00:19:44,124
without turning back.

439
00:19:44,124 --> 00:19:45,085
But why

440
00:19:46,124 --> 00:19:47,924
are you back now?

441
00:19:50,485 --> 00:19:51,285
Grandma,

442
00:19:51,604 --> 00:19:53,364
I invited Ms. Zheng back.

443
00:19:53,965 --> 00:19:56,045
I thought that Ms. Zheng
had looked after my mother

444
00:19:56,045 --> 00:19:56,924
until her passing

445
00:19:56,965 --> 00:19:58,844
and also cultivated Qing Qu for me,

446
00:19:58,965 --> 00:20:00,844
so I asked Qing Qu

447
00:20:00,965 --> 00:20:02,565
to invite her back

448
00:20:02,765 --> 00:20:04,844
to have some fun in the capital
for some days.

449
00:20:05,444 --> 00:20:06,325
Old Madam,

450
00:20:06,644 --> 00:20:08,765
I had my reason back then.

451
00:20:09,005 --> 00:20:10,725
Please don't blame me.

452
00:20:11,364 --> 00:20:12,164
Well.

453
00:20:13,204 --> 00:20:15,485
I don't want to rake up the past.

454
00:20:22,748 --> 00:20:23,684
Thank you, Old Madam.

455
00:20:23,684 --> 00:20:24,765
The past

456
00:20:25,085 --> 00:20:26,444
is in the past.

457
00:20:30,205 --> 00:20:33,327
(Liuhe Tavern)

458
00:20:45,364 --> 00:20:48,045
"I would rather die

459
00:20:48,285 --> 00:20:50,325
than crouch in shame.

460
00:20:50,325 --> 00:20:52,565
Eagles do not blend with the flock,

461
00:20:52,565 --> 00:20:54,285
standing alone, proud and lofty."

462
00:20:54,448 --> 00:20:55,568
Daoyan, your calligraphy

463
00:20:55,632 --> 00:20:56,640
is as strong and peculiar

464
00:20:56,644 --> 00:20:58,444
as it were.

465
00:20:59,924 --> 00:21:00,965
"To depart from trouble

466
00:21:01,644 --> 00:21:02,924
is to depart from suffering."

467
00:21:03,325 --> 00:21:04,124
Daoyan.

468
00:21:06,096 --> 00:21:07,280
You just got rid of trouble.

469
00:21:07,644 --> 00:21:08,965
Why don't we

470
00:21:09,644 --> 00:21:10,684
relax a bit tonight?

471
00:21:13,725 --> 00:21:14,485
Senior Daoyan,

472
00:21:15,285 --> 00:21:16,444
Shenyuan is here with us.

473
00:21:16,444 --> 00:21:17,844
Come try my cooking.

474
00:21:18,325 --> 00:21:19,164
It has been years

475
00:21:19,164 --> 00:21:20,965
since we have all gathered together.

476
00:21:25,765 --> 00:21:27,045
What's wrong, Daoyan?

477
00:21:27,264 --> 00:21:29,168
Perhaps he hasn't recovered
from his old injury.

478
00:21:29,325 --> 00:21:31,204
Daoyan, I will send a physician for you.

479
00:21:31,364 --> 00:21:32,245
No need.

480
00:21:33,124 --> 00:21:35,444
Just a throat issue, nothing new.

481
00:22:01,725 --> 00:22:02,604
Seventh Lady.

482
00:22:03,965 --> 00:22:04,844
Ms. Zheng.

483
00:22:09,285 --> 00:22:10,245
Seventh Lady,

484
00:22:10,404 --> 00:22:11,725
you still keep

485
00:22:11,725 --> 00:22:13,124
your mother's belongings.

486
00:22:13,404 --> 00:22:15,644
When my mother passed away,

487
00:22:16,285 --> 00:22:17,245
Mistress Qiao

488
00:22:17,364 --> 00:22:20,444
sold all of her dowry.

489
00:22:20,604 --> 00:22:22,364
Even the Minglan Hall was torn down.

490
00:22:23,325 --> 00:22:24,124
Now,

491
00:22:24,604 --> 00:22:26,245
these are the only things left.

492
00:22:27,924 --> 00:22:29,965
Mistress Qiao is indeed wicked.

493
00:22:30,404 --> 00:22:32,604
Grandma must've told you

494
00:22:33,164 --> 00:22:35,085
not to tell me too much.

495
00:22:35,765 --> 00:22:36,844
Mistress Qiao

496
00:22:37,124 --> 00:22:38,565
has received her retribution.

497
00:22:38,805 --> 00:22:39,965
We will let bygone

498
00:22:40,604 --> 00:22:42,045
be bygone.

499
00:22:43,684 --> 00:22:45,965
Yes, it's all the past.

500
00:22:46,725 --> 00:22:48,565
As long as you are well,

501
00:22:48,884 --> 00:22:51,364
Madam Gu will rest in peace.

502
00:22:52,565 --> 00:22:53,325
Young Lady,

503
00:22:53,765 --> 00:22:55,884
let me take your pulse.

504
00:22:56,285 --> 00:22:57,565
Qing Qu wrote in the letter

505
00:22:57,565 --> 00:22:58,884
that you are not feeling well.

506
00:22:59,285 --> 00:23:01,085
Though I'm not inept at healing,

507
00:23:01,285 --> 00:23:02,565
I will try my best

508
00:23:02,565 --> 00:23:04,245
to heal you.

509
00:23:04,805 --> 00:23:05,684
Ms. Zheng,

510
00:23:06,565 --> 00:23:07,364
I was

511
00:23:07,444 --> 00:23:09,285
feeling unwell before,

512
00:23:10,285 --> 00:23:11,565
but I have recovered

513
00:23:11,924 --> 00:23:13,164
these past few days.

514
00:23:13,245 --> 00:23:14,005
But Qing Qu said...

515
00:23:14,005 --> 00:23:14,924
I lied to you.

516
00:23:15,184 --> 00:23:17,480
I asked Qing Qu to lie to you,
so that you would return here.

517
00:23:18,805 --> 00:23:19,644
Ms. Zheng,

518
00:23:20,485 --> 00:23:23,124
to be frank,
I have something to ask you.

519
00:23:24,124 --> 00:23:25,604
How much do you know

520
00:23:27,124 --> 00:23:28,644
about my mother's death?

521
00:23:29,285 --> 00:23:30,604
I will tell you

522
00:23:31,204 --> 00:23:33,444
as much as I know.

523
00:23:34,684 --> 00:23:36,965
Back then, Father favored Mistress Qiao.

524
00:23:38,164 --> 00:23:40,285
My mother couldn't endure
such humiliation,

525
00:23:40,765 --> 00:23:42,124
so she moved to the side yard

526
00:23:42,725 --> 00:23:45,245
and asked Father for a divorce.

527
00:23:46,164 --> 00:23:47,285
Is this true?

528
00:23:48,444 --> 00:23:49,684
Yes, it is.

529
00:23:50,736 --> 00:23:52,960
Your father favored the concubine
and neglected his wife.

530
00:23:53,124 --> 00:23:54,045
Besides, Mistress Qiao

531
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:56,725
often used cunning tricks.

532
00:23:57,404 --> 00:23:59,124
She spread rumors

533
00:23:59,684 --> 00:24:01,604
and slandered Madam Gu
for endangering her.

534
00:24:02,124 --> 00:24:03,924
Madam Gu had a lofty character

535
00:24:04,124 --> 00:24:05,565
and didn't want to compete with her.

536
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:08,884
If not for you,

537
00:24:09,164 --> 00:24:10,245
Madam Gu

538
00:24:10,768 --> 00:24:12,880
wouldn't have returned
to the Luo's Residence.

539
00:24:14,444 --> 00:24:15,245
If so,

540
00:24:15,725 --> 00:24:17,285
did Father visit her

541
00:24:17,725 --> 00:24:19,684
after Mother returned?

542
00:24:20,124 --> 00:24:21,285
He came once.

543
00:24:22,604 --> 00:24:24,644
It was when you were just born.

544
00:24:25,604 --> 00:24:26,444
At that time,

545
00:24:26,924 --> 00:24:29,444
your father bought some tea leaves

546
00:24:29,725 --> 00:24:31,844
that your mother liked.

547
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:33,644
Tea leaves?

548
00:24:34,684 --> 00:24:35,444
Yes.

549
00:24:36,444 --> 00:24:38,164
I remember clearly

550
00:24:38,285 --> 00:24:39,245
that your father

551
00:24:39,765 --> 00:24:42,085
was unexpectedly friendly

552
00:24:42,285 --> 00:24:43,604
that day.

553
00:24:44,565 --> 00:24:46,045
He played with you.

554
00:24:46,285 --> 00:24:47,844
Your mother noticed that,

555
00:24:47,884 --> 00:24:49,884
so she didn't turn him away

556
00:24:50,684 --> 00:24:52,844
and took a few sips of the tea
he brought.

557
00:24:53,604 --> 00:24:55,124
Yet after a brief conversation,

558
00:24:55,325 --> 00:24:56,404
he was actually coveting

559
00:24:56,404 --> 00:24:58,844
the dowry Madam Gu prepared for you.

560
00:24:59,085 --> 00:25:00,325
He wanted Madam Gu

561
00:25:00,325 --> 00:25:02,124
to buy him a position in the court.

562
00:25:02,805 --> 00:25:04,565
Madam Gu was furious

563
00:25:04,805 --> 00:25:06,644
and poured the tea
into the hardy begonia.

564
00:25:06,924 --> 00:25:08,045
Unexpectedly,

565
00:25:09,124 --> 00:25:11,245
the root of those hardy begonias
withered.

566
00:25:12,364 --> 00:25:14,884
Hardy begonia?

567
00:25:15,965 --> 00:25:17,364
But Grandma told me

568
00:25:18,005 --> 00:25:19,924
it was because
of the Mongolian milkvetch

569
00:25:19,924 --> 00:25:20,924
and peony tonic.

570
00:25:20,965 --> 00:25:22,245
That's an excuse

571
00:25:22,325 --> 00:25:23,959
your mother told Old Madam

572
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,040
as she didn't want to drink

573
00:25:25,104 --> 00:25:26,440
the tea your father brought.

574
00:25:28,565 --> 00:25:29,485
Tea leaves?

575
00:25:43,844 --> 00:25:46,204
Yes, this is that one.

576
00:25:46,245 --> 00:25:47,485
This is the tea

577
00:25:47,604 --> 00:25:49,204
Second Master gave to your mother.

578
00:25:50,045 --> 00:25:51,684
I can't believe it still exists.

579
00:25:55,005 --> 00:25:56,325
Will my mother's death

580
00:25:57,684 --> 00:25:58,485
be related

581
00:25:59,565 --> 00:26:02,325
to Father?

582
00:26:02,684 --> 00:26:04,644
Of course, it's related to him.

583
00:26:04,884 --> 00:26:05,684
If not

584
00:26:05,684 --> 00:26:07,325
for his cruelty,

585
00:26:07,644 --> 00:26:09,684
your mother wouldn't have fallen ill

586
00:26:09,884 --> 00:26:11,124
and passed away

587
00:26:11,164 --> 00:26:13,005
at such a young age.

588
00:26:18,404 --> 00:26:19,604
Send Senior Daoyan away

589
00:26:19,644 --> 00:26:20,684
as quickly as possible.

590
00:26:21,045 --> 00:26:22,725
Don't let Lu Jiaxue's men find out.

591
00:26:23,005 --> 00:26:23,844
Yes.

592
00:26:23,844 --> 00:26:25,085
Qi An will handle that.

593
00:26:26,644 --> 00:26:28,444
No, I will do it myself.

594
00:26:30,725 --> 00:26:32,245
Daoyan is the proudest student

595
00:26:32,245 --> 00:26:33,005
of Master.

596
00:26:34,032 --> 00:26:35,600
He passed the exam
when he was a teenager

597
00:26:35,984 --> 00:26:38,320
and was personally appointed
as an official by His Majesty.

598
00:26:38,884 --> 00:26:40,805
Yet he has to live on the run now.

599
00:26:42,124 --> 00:26:42,924
It's my fault.

600
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:44,720
It has been three years,

601
00:26:44,848 --> 00:26:46,560
and I still haven't achieved
anything yet.

602
00:26:47,008 --> 00:26:48,448
Young Master, you run Liuhe Tavern

603
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:49,860
and the sea transportation business,

604
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,648
have protected all your
seniors and juniors,

605
00:26:51,684 --> 00:26:53,325
found Li Yinglong and Lu Jiaxue,

606
00:26:53,376 --> 00:26:55,160
and even obtained the statement
from Old Madam.

607
00:26:55,216 --> 00:26:56,992
How could you say
you have achieved nothing?

608
00:27:01,844 --> 00:27:02,684
Third Brother.

609
00:27:12,565 --> 00:27:14,005
Seventh Lady, the tea is ready.

610
00:27:17,104 --> 00:27:18,560
Have you made up your mind?

611
00:27:49,444 --> 00:27:50,164
It seems

612
00:27:50,164 --> 00:27:51,404
everything is all right.

613
00:27:54,272 --> 00:27:56,790
(No animals were harmed
during the making of this series.)

614
00:28:00,805 --> 00:28:01,604
It's poisoned.

615
00:28:12,924 --> 00:28:13,725
Yining.

616
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:17,245
Father.

617
00:28:19,005 --> 00:28:20,204
Where's your handmaiden?

618
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,312
Why aren't they with you?

619
00:28:21,328 --> 00:28:22,432
It's already late at night.

620
00:28:22,844 --> 00:28:24,164
What are you doing here?

621
00:28:24,844 --> 00:28:26,285
I was on my way to see you, Father.

622
00:28:28,204 --> 00:28:30,005
Lately, I have been sorting things out,

623
00:28:30,684 --> 00:28:32,204
and saw Mother's belongings.

624
00:28:32,256 --> 00:28:33,600
They bring back memories of her,

625
00:28:33,924 --> 00:28:36,085
so I came out for some fresh air.

626
00:28:37,085 --> 00:28:38,124
She's already at peace.

627
00:28:38,684 --> 00:28:39,644
It's all in the past.

628
00:28:40,005 --> 00:28:41,485
Digging up these things

629
00:28:41,684 --> 00:28:43,164
will only add to your sorrow.

630
00:28:43,644 --> 00:28:44,965
Have you already forgotten

631
00:28:45,485 --> 00:28:47,765
the people and things from the past?

632
00:28:49,844 --> 00:28:51,565
But I still can't forget

633
00:28:52,005 --> 00:28:53,364
Mother's voice and face.

634
00:28:54,485 --> 00:28:55,325
So

635
00:28:58,684 --> 00:28:59,684
I would like to ask you...

636
00:28:59,684 --> 00:29:00,325
Seventh Sister,

637
00:29:01,216 --> 00:29:02,624
what are you doing here?

638
00:29:07,005 --> 00:29:07,404
Father.

639
00:29:08,124 --> 00:29:09,325
That's rude.

640
00:29:09,792 --> 00:29:11,392
Don't think that because you wrote

641
00:29:11,392 --> 00:29:12,640
a good poem at the Literary Feast

642
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:13,684
and people

643
00:29:13,684 --> 00:29:15,565
started calling you
"Third Young Master Luo",

644
00:29:15,565 --> 00:29:17,045
you can act as you please.

645
00:29:17,285 --> 00:29:19,644
Know your place.

646
00:29:19,765 --> 00:29:20,565
I'm now

647
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:22,644
Mr. Sun's student.

648
00:29:23,056 --> 00:29:24,704
I don't have any other identities

649
00:29:25,085 --> 00:29:25,844
other than that.

650
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:30,164
You are talking back to me?

651
00:29:30,805 --> 00:29:32,404
Stay in Jimo House

652
00:29:32,404 --> 00:29:33,325
these days

653
00:29:33,325 --> 00:29:34,325
and don't leave.

654
00:29:34,364 --> 00:29:35,884
Am I under house arrest?

655
00:29:36,565 --> 00:29:37,644
But Mr. Sun told me

656
00:29:37,684 --> 00:29:39,325
to attend a literary gathering with him.

657
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:41,725
In that case,

658
00:29:42,604 --> 00:29:43,565
I won't go.

659
00:29:43,565 --> 00:29:43,924
Go.

660
00:29:49,444 --> 00:29:50,725
You have to go.

661
00:29:51,005 --> 00:29:51,805
Perform well.

662
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:53,604
Yes.

663
00:29:54,644 --> 00:29:56,644
Yining, what was it you wanted to ask?

664
00:30:07,285 --> 00:30:08,124
Get rest early.

665
00:30:18,444 --> 00:30:19,684
I understand how you feel.

666
00:30:20,924 --> 00:30:22,684
But the poisoned tea

667
00:30:22,965 --> 00:30:24,245
doesn't prove anything.

668
00:30:25,164 --> 00:30:26,245
If it was him,

669
00:30:26,485 --> 00:30:27,844
he wouldn't tell you

670
00:30:28,164 --> 00:30:28,965
the truth

671
00:30:28,965 --> 00:30:30,164
if you had no evidence.

672
00:30:30,805 --> 00:30:31,604
Third Brother,

673
00:30:34,805 --> 00:30:35,884
what should I do?

674
00:30:38,204 --> 00:30:39,164
I thought

675
00:30:39,164 --> 00:30:40,844
my heart was cold enough

676
00:30:41,325 --> 00:30:42,884
to bear every consequence,

677
00:30:44,245 --> 00:30:45,045
but...

678
00:30:47,893 --> 00:30:54,126
♪Stirring up trouble, loneliness,
stirring up a sky full of fireworks♪

679
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:58,134
♪Through the trials, who set it,
and who bore the consequence?♪

680
00:30:58,245 --> 00:30:59,204
There, there.

681
00:31:00,404 --> 00:31:01,204
You still have me.

682
00:31:02,884 --> 00:31:03,725
I'm with you.

683
00:31:09,285 --> 00:31:10,364
If it's truly him,

684
00:31:12,644 --> 00:31:14,684
just follow your heart.

685
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:20,293
♪Afraid of missing out and mistakes,
of begonias blooming and withering♪

686
00:31:20,404 --> 00:31:22,325
Even if you go against the entire world,

687
00:31:24,124 --> 00:31:24,924
I will definitely

688
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:26,124
be on your side.

689
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:32,857
♪Your gentle presence leaves

690
00:31:33,168 --> 00:31:39,248

693
00:32:06,485 --> 00:32:07,765
This is my mother.

694
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:08,765
Is she pretty?

695
00:32:09,325 --> 00:32:10,124
She's pretty.

696
00:32:10,884 --> 00:32:12,684
So, am I pretty as well?

697
00:32:12,684 --> 00:32:13,399
Yes.

698
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:14,400
You are the prettiest one

699
00:32:14,464 --> 00:32:15,360
in this world.

700
00:32:20,684 --> 00:32:21,404
Third Brother,

701
00:32:23,085 --> 00:32:24,684
until I figure out

702
00:32:25,245 --> 00:32:26,124
whether Father

703
00:32:26,124 --> 00:32:27,485
was involved,

704
00:32:28,565 --> 00:32:30,164
I won't be able to rest easy.

705
00:32:47,765 --> 00:32:48,285
Please.

706
00:32:48,325 --> 00:32:50,045
Sorry to disturb you again.

707
00:32:50,485 --> 00:32:51,325
Physician Zhao,

708
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,216
I have a doubt.

709
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:54,560
I'd like to seek your guidance.

710
00:32:54,672 --> 00:32:56,160
Have you discovered

711
00:32:56,208 --> 00:32:57,440
any new clues, Seventh Lady?

712
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:59,600
I asked the old maid who used to serve
my mother before.

713
00:32:59,725 --> 00:33:01,164
She said before my mother passed away,

714
00:33:01,164 --> 00:33:02,285
she was in great pain.

715
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,600
Her mouth and tongue were numb,

716
00:33:03,884 --> 00:33:05,045
her whole body was stinging,

717
00:33:05,152 --> 00:33:06,360
and she couldn't speak clearly.

718
00:33:06,368 --> 00:33:08,080
Are these symptoms of certain illnesses?

719
00:33:09,325 --> 00:33:11,045
I have never heard of Madam Gu

720
00:33:11,045 --> 00:33:12,164
having such symptoms.

721
00:33:12,325 --> 00:33:13,485
From your description,

722
00:33:13,552 --> 00:33:15,616
it sounds more like
she took the wrong medicine

723
00:33:15,684 --> 00:33:16,805
or was poisoned.

724
00:33:19,404 --> 00:33:20,325
This is the tea leaves

725
00:33:20,325 --> 00:33:21,604
she drank before.

726
00:33:22,005 --> 00:33:23,005
I tested it.

727
00:33:23,005 --> 00:33:24,005
It's poisonous.

728
00:33:24,164 --> 00:33:25,844
Please help me to find out

729
00:33:26,085 --> 00:33:27,245
what poison it is.

730
00:33:30,884 --> 00:33:31,684
Daoyan,

731
00:33:32,684 --> 00:33:33,644
we are parting ways now.

732
00:33:34,285 --> 00:33:35,285
Please take care.

733
00:33:35,765 --> 00:33:36,325
Yuan,

734
00:33:37,204 --> 00:33:38,644
I hope the next time we meet

735
00:33:39,364 --> 00:33:41,164
will be the day
when Master's case is reopened.

736
00:33:41,844 --> 00:33:42,765
Rest assured, Daoyan.

737
00:33:43,184 --> 00:33:44,880
I'll make sure
all the seniors and juniors

738
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,272
get rid of the life on the run.

739
00:33:52,325 --> 00:33:53,124
Qi An,

740
00:33:53,504 --> 00:33:54,880
stay alert along the journey.

741
00:33:55,684 --> 00:33:56,604
Look out for my senior.

742
00:33:57,325 --> 00:33:58,204
Yes, Young Master.

743
00:34:14,324 --> 00:34:15,124
Young Master,

744
00:34:15,324 --> 00:34:17,405
the thing Seventh Lady needs is ready.

745
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:23,197
(Luo's Residence)

746
00:34:24,804 --> 00:34:25,565
Father.

747
00:34:27,005 --> 00:34:28,085
You are here, too, Yining.

748
00:34:28,684 --> 00:34:29,445
Mother.

749
00:34:31,005 --> 00:34:32,124
I came to pay my respects.

750
00:34:35,644 --> 00:34:36,405
Sit.

751
00:34:42,804 --> 00:34:44,405
She came here early in the morning

752
00:34:44,604 --> 00:34:46,965
for breakfast.

753
00:34:48,005 --> 00:34:50,284
I really like the food prepared
by Grandma's kitchen.

754
00:34:50,284 --> 00:34:52,005
I heard they had served

755
00:34:52,005 --> 00:34:53,390
the seasonal osmanthus cake recently,

756
00:34:53,405 --> 00:34:54,724
so I came to try it.

757
00:34:54,885 --> 00:34:56,405
If you like it,

758
00:34:56,405 --> 00:34:58,284
I can have the cook

759
00:34:58,284 --> 00:35:00,164
send some for you.

760
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:01,679
But it tastes better

761
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,912
when I come here to enjoy it.

762
00:35:04,565 --> 00:35:05,925
It tastes better to eat it here?

763
00:35:06,124 --> 00:35:07,359
This girl.

764
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,736
You make such a mischievous excuse

765
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,520
for the food.

766
00:35:12,284 --> 00:35:13,085
Grandma,

767
00:35:13,405 --> 00:35:14,845
I didn't come empty-handed.

768
00:35:15,045 --> 00:35:16,684
I brought

769
00:35:16,684 --> 00:35:17,845
some fine tea here.

770
00:35:18,085 --> 00:35:19,885
It's already roasted and ground

771
00:35:19,885 --> 00:35:21,005
into tea powder.

772
00:35:21,164 --> 00:35:22,804
Since Father is here too,

773
00:35:22,845 --> 00:35:24,244
let's try it together.

774
00:35:25,085 --> 00:35:25,885
Xue Zhi.

775
00:35:26,485 --> 00:35:27,164
I have something

776
00:35:27,164 --> 00:35:28,845
to attend to later,

777
00:35:28,965 --> 00:35:30,124
so I'm not drinking the tea.

778
00:35:30,485 --> 00:35:31,845
Since you are all right,

779
00:35:32,005 --> 00:35:34,405
I will take my leave.

780
00:35:34,485 --> 00:35:35,445
Father, please stay.

781
00:35:36,565 --> 00:35:38,324
This tea is special.

782
00:35:38,885 --> 00:35:41,045
I hope we can savor it together.

783
00:35:42,525 --> 00:35:44,324
I have tried all kinds of tea.

784
00:35:44,885 --> 00:35:45,965
Chengzhang,

785
00:35:45,965 --> 00:35:47,845
just stay and drink it.

786
00:35:48,005 --> 00:35:49,684
It won't affect your appointment.

787
00:35:50,244 --> 00:35:51,405
I wonder

788
00:35:51,405 --> 00:35:53,164
what she's going to show us.

789
00:36:14,563 --> 00:36:19,251
♪South wind weaves
a brocade tapestry of lives♪

790
00:36:19,362 --> 00:36:23,885
♪Begonias lean on each other
in front of a turquoise pond♪

791
00:36:23,996 --> 00:36:31,909
♪The tea fragrance wafts

792
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:37,649
♪A bright heart will radiate the world♪

793
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,289
♪Family is the safe haven

794
00:36:44,604 --> 00:36:45,365
Grandma,

795
00:36:45,925 --> 00:36:47,284
this is the smallest portion,

796
00:36:47,485 --> 00:36:49,204
so it won't affect your nap.

797
00:36:53,045 --> 00:36:53,845
Father,

798
00:36:54,164 --> 00:36:54,965
I know

799
00:36:54,965 --> 00:36:56,445
you are a tea expert.

800
00:36:56,764 --> 00:36:58,845
This cup contains
the tea's original taste.

801
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:00,005
Please try it.

802
00:37:00,805 --> 00:37:06,689
♪Red strings on the eaves,
bind two devoted hearts together♪

803
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:11,885
♪Through half a lifetime

804
00:37:26,124 --> 00:37:27,124
Father,

805
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:28,720
what do you think about this tea?

806
00:37:30,528 --> 00:37:32,000
This is the Dragon-Phoenix Tea Cake.

807
00:37:34,804 --> 00:37:35,925
You still remember this?

808
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,336
You gave this tea cake to my mother

809
00:37:38,764 --> 00:37:40,284
back then.

810
00:37:40,885 --> 00:37:41,485
This tea is

811
00:37:42,804 --> 00:37:44,804
left by Minglan?

812
00:37:45,005 --> 00:37:45,804
Grandma,

813
00:37:45,965 --> 00:37:48,005
when I found this tea

814
00:37:48,005 --> 00:37:49,005
from Mother's belongings,

815
00:37:49,204 --> 00:37:50,445
I was so excited,

816
00:37:50,496 --> 00:37:51,984
so I immediately brought it to Father

817
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,320
to ask him about it.

818
00:37:53,804 --> 00:37:54,845
You came to me that night

819
00:37:54,845 --> 00:37:55,925
because of this tea?

820
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:01,885
The Dragon-Phoenix Tea Cakes is rare.

821
00:38:02,724 --> 00:38:04,485
It's also hard for the royals

822
00:38:04,925 --> 00:38:06,204
to even get one.

823
00:38:07,324 --> 00:38:08,644
It took me a lot of effort

824
00:38:09,324 --> 00:38:10,324
to get just a little.

825
00:38:11,644 --> 00:38:12,764
I remember

826
00:38:14,204 --> 00:38:16,085
Minglan and I had a fight that day.

827
00:38:17,604 --> 00:38:18,365
I thought

828
00:38:20,164 --> 00:38:20,965
she had already

829
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,244
thrown this tea away.

830
00:38:22,684 --> 00:38:23,565
Unexpectedly,

831
00:38:24,684 --> 00:38:26,164
she had kept it for over a decade.

832
00:38:28,644 --> 00:38:30,045
Why did you fight?

833
00:38:30,644 --> 00:38:31,405
Was it about

834
00:38:31,485 --> 00:38:33,485
Mistress Qiao again?

835
00:38:33,565 --> 00:38:34,324
No.

836
00:38:34,724 --> 00:38:35,604
At that time,

837
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,552
I encountered some problems
in the court.

838
00:38:37,644 --> 00:38:39,485
Father was upright

839
00:38:39,485 --> 00:38:40,485
and refused to help me,

840
00:38:40,644 --> 00:38:41,324
so I thought

841
00:38:41,324 --> 00:38:43,124
about spending some money
to resolve the issue,

842
00:38:44,485 --> 00:38:45,764
so I asked your mother

843
00:38:47,885 --> 00:38:49,324
for some of her dowry.

844
00:38:50,604 --> 00:38:52,485
How foolish!

845
00:38:53,124 --> 00:38:55,085
How could you think about bribery

846
00:38:55,085 --> 00:38:56,405
and even using

847
00:38:56,405 --> 00:38:57,804
Minglan's dowry?

848
00:38:58,124 --> 00:38:59,324
Mother, you are right.

849
00:38:59,764 --> 00:39:01,764
I deeply regretted it.

850
00:39:01,845 --> 00:39:02,485
I wouldn't dare

851
00:39:02,485 --> 00:39:03,604
think of doing it again.

852
00:39:04,445 --> 00:39:06,965
If your father were
to find out about this,

853
00:39:07,284 --> 00:39:09,284
he would definitely punish you severely.

854
00:39:09,445 --> 00:39:11,405
I wasn't thinking straight at that time.

855
00:39:12,684 --> 00:39:14,845
But fortunately,
I didn't disgrace the family.

856
00:39:20,284 --> 00:39:21,639
Thank you for getting

857
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,552
this decade-old
Dragon-Phoenix Tea Cake for me.

858
00:39:23,885 --> 00:39:25,005
Without it,

859
00:39:25,152 --> 00:39:26,480
I wouldn't have had the opportunity

860
00:39:26,485 --> 00:39:28,005
to test Father's reaction.

861
00:39:28,485 --> 00:39:29,604
You feel relieved now, right?

862
00:39:31,485 --> 00:39:32,684
Father didn't seem like

863
00:39:32,885 --> 00:39:34,124
he was behind this.

864
00:39:34,684 --> 00:39:36,045
If he feels guilty about it,

865
00:39:36,324 --> 00:39:37,804
he will surely show some signs.

866
00:39:38,445 --> 00:39:39,244
But

867
00:39:39,684 --> 00:39:40,604
if it's not him,

868
00:39:41,324 --> 00:39:42,485
who could it be?

869
00:39:45,472 --> 00:39:46,920
Perhaps the situation becomes clearer

870
00:39:46,925 --> 00:39:48,365
after Physician Zhao

871
00:39:48,565 --> 00:39:49,845
uncovers the poison.

872
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:52,592
Even if it was him,

873
00:39:52,624 --> 00:39:54,160
I don't think you could bring yourself

874
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,120
to sever ties with him.

875
00:39:55,804 --> 00:39:57,405
As terribly wrong and disappointing

876
00:39:58,005 --> 00:39:59,085
as he may be,

877
00:39:59,405 --> 00:40:00,405
he's still

878
00:40:00,965 --> 00:40:02,204
your father.

879
00:40:04,045 --> 00:40:04,845
What about you?

880
00:40:06,244 --> 00:40:07,164
Do you hate him?

881
00:40:10,204 --> 00:40:11,005
I did,

882
00:40:11,724 --> 00:40:12,925
but children

883
00:40:13,045 --> 00:40:14,204
can't choose their parents,

884
00:40:15,485 --> 00:40:16,164
so I just do

885
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:17,604
what I should do.

886
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,040
The autumn examination is nearing.

887
00:40:21,164 --> 00:40:22,604
Your name must be registered

888
00:40:22,925 --> 00:40:24,045
in the family register soon.

889
00:40:25,204 --> 00:40:27,124
Even though

890
00:40:27,124 --> 00:40:28,405
Father has softened toward you,

891
00:40:28,644 --> 00:40:29,804
it's only because

892
00:40:29,804 --> 00:40:31,124
of Mr. Sun.

893
00:40:31,216 --> 00:40:32,448
If we want Father to allow you

894
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,020
to be registered in the family register,

895
00:40:34,324 --> 00:40:35,565
we will have to give it a push.

896
00:40:54,644 --> 00:40:56,365
Mother, you are good at doing business

897
00:40:56,365 --> 00:40:57,565
and managing accounts.

898
00:40:57,684 --> 00:40:59,365
If you hadn't married
into the Luo Family,

899
00:40:59,485 --> 00:41:01,199
you might've become

900
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,432
a successful businesswoman.

901
00:41:02,885 --> 00:41:04,284
At this age,

902
00:41:04,304 --> 00:41:05,840
even if I hadn't married
into the Luo Family,

903
00:41:05,845 --> 00:41:07,164
I would have married someone else.

904
00:41:07,264 --> 00:41:09,000
Women obey their fathers
before getting married

905
00:41:09,124 --> 00:41:10,324
and their husbands after.

906
00:41:10,485 --> 00:41:11,845
No one could tell

907
00:41:11,856 --> 00:41:13,040
which fate could've been better.

908
00:41:13,365 --> 00:41:14,485
Compared to other places,

909
00:41:14,965 --> 00:41:16,445
marrying into the Luo Family

910
00:41:16,485 --> 00:41:17,485
has been pretty good.

911
00:41:18,005 --> 00:41:18,965
At least you are with me.

912
00:41:18,965 --> 00:41:19,764
Besides,

913
00:41:19,925 --> 00:41:21,324
Old Madam has been nice to me.

914
00:41:21,684 --> 00:41:22,565
Mother,

915
00:41:22,724 --> 00:41:24,485
do you plan to continue living like this

916
00:41:24,485 --> 00:41:26,244
with Father?

917
00:41:28,405 --> 00:41:29,485
Your father and I

918
00:41:29,724 --> 00:41:31,045
both live separate lives

919
00:41:31,072 --> 00:41:32,432
and don't interfere with each other.

920
00:41:32,576 --> 00:41:33,840
There's nothing wrong with that.

921
00:41:34,445 --> 00:41:36,124
Why are you asking this all of a sudden?

922
00:41:36,965 --> 00:41:38,965
Of course, I will support

923
00:41:38,965 --> 00:41:40,284
any choice you make,

924
00:41:40,604 --> 00:41:41,845
but I think

925
00:41:41,845 --> 00:41:42,965
it's better

926
00:41:42,965 --> 00:41:44,365
to plan for the future.

927
00:41:44,965 --> 00:41:46,804
What if

928
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:48,405
I get married

929
00:41:48,445 --> 00:41:50,204
and Mistress Qiao

930
00:41:50,565 --> 00:41:51,604
returns here?

931
00:41:52,845 --> 00:41:54,845
What do you mean?

932
00:41:55,965 --> 00:41:58,164
Mother, ever since the Literary Feast,

933
00:41:58,405 --> 00:41:59,164
even though Father

934
00:41:59,164 --> 00:42:00,684
doesn't like Third Brother,

935
00:42:00,764 --> 00:42:02,164
he has had to acknowledge

936
00:42:02,244 --> 00:42:03,485
in front of everyone

937
00:42:03,485 --> 00:42:05,485
that Third Brother
is part of the Luo Family.

938
00:42:06,164 --> 00:42:08,485
If you take him as your son,

939
00:42:08,724 --> 00:42:10,124
you will have a legitimate son.

940
00:42:10,124 --> 00:42:10,925
You can rely on him

941
00:42:10,965 --> 00:42:12,244
in the future, right?

942
00:42:13,365 --> 00:42:15,324
Besides, Third Brother is kind

943
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:16,445
and knowledgeable.

944
00:42:16,464 --> 00:42:18,680
If he successfully passes
the triennial palace examination,

945
00:42:18,684 --> 00:42:20,280
you'll be the mother
of a palace graduate.

946
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,616
If he tops in
the final palace exam,

947
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:23,644
you're the mother
of the honorary principal graduate.

948
00:42:25,164 --> 00:42:26,684
You make it sound

949
00:42:26,764 --> 00:42:28,845
like passing the examination is easy.

950
00:42:29,124 --> 00:42:31,204
Besides, he's an adult now.

951
00:42:31,764 --> 00:42:34,045
I don't think
I can be a good mother to him.

952
00:42:35,005 --> 00:42:35,804
If you can't

953
00:42:35,804 --> 00:42:37,124
do it well,

954
00:42:37,124 --> 00:42:38,479
no one else in this residence can.

955
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,416
Ever since you took over
the household management,

956
00:42:40,464 --> 00:42:41,840
you have always left a share

957
00:42:41,885 --> 00:42:43,644
for him in everything.

958
00:42:44,845 --> 00:42:45,724
Being fair to everyone

959
00:42:45,724 --> 00:42:46,684
is the way it should be.

960
00:42:47,845 --> 00:42:48,885
Besides,

961
00:42:49,284 --> 00:42:51,445
when you sprained your foot

962
00:42:51,485 --> 00:42:52,724
at the estate last time,

963
00:42:52,724 --> 00:42:55,445
Third Brother offered to carry you
all the way back.

964
00:42:55,684 --> 00:42:56,965
That's how a mother and a son do.

965
00:43:00,244 --> 00:43:01,244
Well,

966
00:43:02,644 --> 00:43:04,845
I used to think he looked gloomy,

967
00:43:04,965 --> 00:43:05,965
but this time,

968
00:43:06,644 --> 00:43:09,565
I realized that he's actually kind.

969
00:43:11,045 --> 00:43:11,845
Besides,

970
00:43:11,845 --> 00:43:14,085
he's a grateful person.

971
00:43:14,244 --> 00:43:16,124
He will surely be nice to you.

972
00:43:17,724 --> 00:43:18,604
Regarding this,

973
00:43:19,324 --> 00:43:21,124
I need to discuss it with your father.

974
00:43:21,604 --> 00:43:22,405
As you know,

975
00:43:22,804 --> 00:43:24,005
your father

976
00:43:24,112 --> 00:43:25,400
might not be easily convinced.
