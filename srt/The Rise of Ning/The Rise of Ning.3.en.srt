00:01:43,111 --> 00:01:44,868
(Liuhe Tavern)

5
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:50,681
Chen Jiuheng,
Vice Minister of Revenue,

6
00:01:50,864 --> 00:01:52,640
was assigned
to a disaster relief mission,

7
00:01:52,681 --> 00:01:54,321
but he embezzled the funds.

8
00:01:54,722 --> 00:01:55,761
His crime is unforgivable.

9
00:01:58,481 --> 00:01:59,162
Take him away.

10
00:02:00,082 --> 00:02:00,681
Master!

11
00:02:07,442 --> 00:02:09,282
Young Master, you are finally awake.

12
00:02:09,307 --> 00:02:10,468
Get up now.

13
00:02:10,493 --> 00:02:11,694
It is almost noon.

14
00:02:12,201 --> 00:02:13,801
Hurry and take your breakfast.

15
00:02:14,842 --> 00:02:17,201
You must've drunk a lot
with your seniors last night.

16
00:02:17,511 --> 00:02:19,071
I will let some fresh air in.

17
00:02:24,442 --> 00:02:27,282
Young Master,
isn't that Seventh Lady?

18
00:02:30,962 --> 00:02:31,641
Young misses.

19
00:02:32,562 --> 00:02:34,361
Di Suite, please, sir.

20
00:02:34,435 --> 00:02:35,195
Di Suite?

21
00:02:35,562 --> 00:02:37,402
Bring the two misses there.

22
00:02:37,641 --> 00:02:38,481
This way, please.

23
00:02:41,122 --> 00:02:42,321
Who sent this?

24
00:02:43,282 --> 00:02:44,842
I couldn't see that person's face.

25
00:02:45,921 --> 00:02:46,682
Second Master,

26
00:02:47,002 --> 00:02:49,730
this letter concerns
Seventh Lady's chastity.

27
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,160
Perhaps

28
00:02:51,522 --> 00:02:52,962
this is a false alarm.

29
00:02:53,361 --> 00:02:54,601
Whether it is or not,

30
00:02:55,201 --> 00:02:56,761
prepare a carriage. I'm going out.

31
00:02:56,786 --> 00:02:57,265
Yes.

32
00:02:59,682 --> 00:03:01,282
Young misses, how may I help you?

33
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,361
Is there a vacant room beside Di Suite?

34
00:03:03,682 --> 00:03:04,842
There's this Ren Suite.

35
00:03:06,002 --> 00:03:07,442
- I will take that.
- All right.

36
00:03:07,584 --> 00:03:09,024
Show them the way to the Ren Suite.

37
00:03:09,088 --> 00:03:10,230
Young misses, this way, please.

38
00:03:14,122 --> 00:03:14,601
Please.

39
00:03:17,282 --> 00:03:19,201
Father has received the letter.

40
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,512
I'd like to see how Luo Yining

41
00:03:20,587 --> 00:03:22,187
will react when Father shows up here.

42
00:03:25,081 --> 00:03:25,601
Sir,

43
00:03:26,386 --> 00:03:28,146
where is the Ren Suite?

44
00:03:28,195 --> 00:03:28,994
Ren Suite?

45
00:03:29,497 --> 00:03:30,137
This way.

46
00:03:30,361 --> 00:03:31,722
Show him the way.

47
00:03:31,746 --> 00:03:32,426
This way, please.

48
00:03:35,402 --> 00:03:36,201
Welcome.

49
00:03:37,321 --> 00:03:40,002
Sir, are you here for a drink
or a performance?

50
00:03:40,016 --> 00:03:40,960
I'm looking for someone.

51
00:03:41,122 --> 00:03:41,921
Looking for someone?

52
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,520
(Ren Suite)

53
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:54,682
Young Lady,

54
00:03:55,682 --> 00:03:57,601
Second Master
and Young Master Jiang are here.

55
00:03:57,626 --> 00:03:59,755
I doubt Seventh Lady
can get away this time.

56
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:02,900
(Di Suite)

57
00:04:08,641 --> 00:04:09,321
Father?

58
00:04:12,801 --> 00:04:14,122
There you are.

59
00:04:15,601 --> 00:04:16,241
Where is he?

60
00:04:16,428 --> 00:04:17,188
Who?

61
00:04:18,202 --> 00:04:20,082
What are you talking about, Father?

62
00:04:22,842 --> 00:04:23,522
Come out!

63
00:04:27,082 --> 00:04:27,801
Second Master.

64
00:04:33,121 --> 00:04:34,481
What are you doing here?

65
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:36,313
Seventh Lady and I

66
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:38,240
came to Liuhe Tavern
to try their new dishes.

67
00:04:39,921 --> 00:04:41,202
Where is Mr. Jiang?

68
00:04:42,121 --> 00:04:43,522
Mr. Jiang?

69
00:04:45,121 --> 00:04:47,297
Why would I meet a man in private?

70
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:48,571
Don't try to hide it.

71
00:04:48,762 --> 00:04:49,962
I knew

72
00:04:50,018 --> 00:04:52,417
you arranged a meeting with Mr. Jiang

73
00:04:53,066 --> 00:04:55,066
to call off the engagement.

74
00:04:56,282 --> 00:04:57,561
Why are you here?

75
00:05:00,001 --> 00:05:01,842
This noon, at Liuhe Tavern.

76
00:05:01,933 --> 00:05:02,933
In the Ren Suite.

77
00:05:03,441 --> 00:05:04,681
I asked to meet you?

78
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:06,561
Aren't you meeting Luo Yining

79
00:05:06,594 --> 00:05:07,995
in the Di Suite?

80
00:05:08,322 --> 00:05:08,842
Yilian,

81
00:05:08,896 --> 00:05:10,720
I don't understand
what you are talking about.

82
00:05:11,241 --> 00:05:13,882
You sent someone
to deliver a note to me.

83
00:05:15,264 --> 00:05:17,290
(Meet me in the Ren Suite
of Liuhe Tavern at noon.)

84
00:05:17,842 --> 00:05:19,801
I know you are still mad at me.

85
00:05:19,921 --> 00:05:21,921
Later, I will tell my mother

86
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:23,074
I won't marry another woman.

87
00:05:23,104 --> 00:05:25,160
Even if I'm to marry the daughter
of the Luo Family,

88
00:05:25,441 --> 00:05:26,522
I will marry only you.

89
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:28,444
What nonsense are you talking about?

90
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,904
I'm not marrying you as a concubine.

91
00:05:31,282 --> 00:05:33,361
Don't worry. I will be kind to you

92
00:05:33,481 --> 00:05:35,162
despite your status as a concubine.

93
00:05:37,641 --> 00:05:38,321
Father.

94
00:05:38,801 --> 00:05:40,282
Why are you doing this?

95
00:05:40,601 --> 00:05:42,522
Are you trying to disgrace me?

96
00:05:42,962 --> 00:05:43,681
Mr. Luo,

97
00:05:43,882 --> 00:05:45,642
Yilian and I sincerely like each other.

98
00:05:45,801 --> 00:05:48,361
Please marry her off to me.

99
00:05:50,481 --> 00:05:52,162
There's no need to tell me that.

100
00:05:52,601 --> 00:05:53,082
I...

101
00:05:53,681 --> 00:05:54,441
Father,

102
00:05:54,794 --> 00:05:56,802
nothing is going on

103
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:57,824
between Mr. Jiang and me.

104
00:05:58,001 --> 00:05:58,681
It's her!

105
00:05:58,921 --> 00:06:00,561
She intentionally lured me here.

106
00:06:00,801 --> 00:06:01,801
Yilian,

107
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:03,561
what are you talking about?

108
00:06:03,762 --> 00:06:05,041
I don't understand.

109
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:09,314
It turns out that Mr. Jiang
and you are in love.

110
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:09,720
I...

111
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,680
I sincerely support you.

112
00:06:12,522 --> 00:06:13,162
Nonsense!

113
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,202
Support them?

114
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,480
Marriage isn't a reckless decision.

115
00:06:17,561 --> 00:06:19,441
Do you have no respect for me?

116
00:06:19,762 --> 00:06:20,361
Mr. Luo,

117
00:06:20,882 --> 00:06:23,121
anyway, I'm going to
marry one of your daughters.

118
00:06:23,147 --> 00:06:25,147
Since you have already learned
of the situation,

119
00:06:25,409 --> 00:06:27,209
I will return to tell my parents

120
00:06:27,298 --> 00:06:29,097
that I will only marry Luo Yilian

121
00:06:29,241 --> 00:06:31,282
and no other Luo's daughter.

122
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:35,282
Father,

123
00:06:35,481 --> 00:06:37,921
have you forgotten what my mother

124
00:06:37,946 --> 00:06:39,147
has been through at home?

125
00:06:39,681 --> 00:06:41,322
I'm your daughter.

126
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,241
Do you bear

127
00:06:42,552 --> 00:06:44,921
to see my whole life ruined?

128
00:06:45,202 --> 00:06:47,241
Father, I do not want to be a concubine.

129
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:48,921
Yilian,

130
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,800
although I can't go against
my parents' decision

131
00:06:50,826 --> 00:06:52,065
to take you as my principal wife,

132
00:06:52,322 --> 00:06:54,282
I will never let you suffer.

133
00:06:54,307 --> 00:06:55,667
Mr. Jiang,

134
00:06:55,771 --> 00:06:57,251
I have already made myself clear.

135
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,400
Why can't you let me go?

136
00:07:02,962 --> 00:07:03,561
Father,

137
00:07:03,968 --> 00:07:06,120
if you insist on marrying me off
as a concubine,

138
00:07:07,681 --> 00:07:10,041
I will take my life
right in front of you now.

139
00:07:14,241 --> 00:07:15,279
- Yilian!
- Yilian!

140
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:15,912
Yilian.

141
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:19,642
Father,

142
00:07:20,282 --> 00:07:22,522
since you can't bear to see her suffer

143
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,544
and want to maintain
the Luo Family's dignity,

144
00:07:24,801 --> 00:07:27,722
there's only one solution.

145
00:07:28,882 --> 00:07:32,467
That is to meet with Madam Jiang
and cancel the engagement.

146
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:33,959
Fine.

147
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,439
The marriage between the two families
is off.

148
00:07:36,762 --> 00:07:39,162
I will pick a day to formally
break off the engagement.

149
00:07:40,082 --> 00:07:40,882
Listen.

150
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,801
Mr. Jiang,

151
00:07:44,282 --> 00:07:46,882
you are going to marry a noble lady

152
00:07:47,041 --> 00:07:49,441
and take the imperial examination soon.

153
00:07:49,561 --> 00:07:51,241
Do consider yourself.

154
00:07:51,481 --> 00:07:52,441
I believe

155
00:07:53,322 --> 00:07:55,282
you will keep it secret.

156
00:07:59,121 --> 00:08:01,962
You are right, Mr. Luo.

157
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,361
The two of you, come home with me.

158
00:08:12,361 --> 00:08:12,921
Young Master,

159
00:08:13,282 --> 00:08:15,241
we just witnessed a great show.

160
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:17,322
That was interesting, indeed.

161
00:08:18,481 --> 00:08:19,801
Women don't have a say

162
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:21,826
in deciding their own marriage.

163
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,450
Seventh Lady
is really something else.

164
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:24,690
She pressured Luo Chengzhang

165
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,759
to cancel the engagement
with the Jiang Family.

166
00:08:28,441 --> 00:08:31,041
Tactical and reasonable.

167
00:08:31,522 --> 00:08:34,362
We should be discreet

168
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:36,800
when searching for evidence from her.

169
00:08:37,721 --> 00:08:38,282
Understood.

170
00:08:43,762 --> 00:08:44,402
Young Lady,

171
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,560
the marriage pact
with the Jiang Family is off now.

172
00:08:46,684 --> 00:08:48,204
Why are you not happy?

173
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:51,201
Father

174
00:08:51,642 --> 00:08:53,522
treats me like a stepping stone

175
00:08:54,402 --> 00:08:56,242
and insists that I marry
into the Jiang Family.

176
00:08:57,441 --> 00:08:58,882
But he won't do that

177
00:08:59,162 --> 00:09:00,801
to Yilian.

178
00:09:02,721 --> 00:09:05,041
Old Madam and Madam Lin
are on your side.

179
00:09:07,242 --> 00:09:08,081
Right.

180
00:09:09,002 --> 00:09:12,041
I only have them.

181
00:09:12,561 --> 00:09:15,122
I have to get my hands dirty

182
00:09:15,482 --> 00:09:17,362
to protect Grandma.

183
00:09:19,362 --> 00:09:20,201
Qing Qu,

184
00:09:20,721 --> 00:09:23,441
do you think I went too far?

185
00:09:24,122 --> 00:09:26,482
I'm doing something I once despised.

186
00:09:27,162 --> 00:09:28,162
Before this,

187
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,721
I truly despised her dirty tricks.

188
00:09:31,681 --> 00:09:32,602
But now,

189
00:09:33,441 --> 00:09:35,162
I have become just like her.

190
00:09:36,961 --> 00:09:39,081
She wouldn't have walked into your trap

191
00:09:39,148 --> 00:09:41,268
if she hadn't harbored an ill intention.

192
00:09:41,721 --> 00:09:43,282
Don't overthink, Young Lady.

193
00:09:51,681 --> 00:09:53,561
Why are you so foolish?

194
00:09:55,138 --> 00:09:56,177
Mother,

195
00:09:56,657 --> 00:09:58,338
what should I do now?

196
00:09:58,561 --> 00:10:00,201
What if... What if Father

197
00:10:00,226 --> 00:10:02,067
punishes me?

198
00:10:02,244 --> 00:10:04,364
Enough. Stop whimpering.

199
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,699
Mother...

200
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,520
Stop it.

201
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,880
Stop crying.

202
00:10:15,801 --> 00:10:16,961
Lian,

203
00:10:17,321 --> 00:10:19,762
do you know how dearly
your father holds you

204
00:10:19,842 --> 00:10:22,201
and how he hates the idea
of you becoming a concubine?

205
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,401
Do you know that?

206
00:10:23,681 --> 00:10:25,242
But you made silly mistakes.

207
00:10:25,921 --> 00:10:27,642
And I have to

208
00:10:27,667 --> 00:10:28,868
clean up after you.

209
00:10:30,246 --> 00:10:31,081
Come.

210
00:10:31,561 --> 00:10:33,482
Twenty strokes on her palm.

211
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:34,920
- Yes.
- Mother.

212
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:37,321
Father didn't punish me.

213
00:10:37,346 --> 00:10:38,866
Why are you beating me?

214
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,650
That's his own decision
whether to punish you.

215
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:42,864
But you need to show
that you are reflecting on yourself.

216
00:10:42,882 --> 00:10:44,602
No, I won't.

217
00:10:45,162 --> 00:10:46,201
Hold out your hand.

218
00:10:47,657 --> 00:10:49,378
Hold out your hand Now.

219
00:10:53,482 --> 00:10:53,882
Beat her.

220
00:10:56,176 --> 00:10:57,550
(Xingfang Abode)

221
00:11:11,801 --> 00:11:13,282
What are you doing?

222
00:11:13,681 --> 00:11:14,362
Yuechan,

223
00:11:14,835 --> 00:11:16,075
what has happened?

224
00:11:16,321 --> 00:11:17,122
Why was Lian

225
00:11:17,482 --> 00:11:18,961
so bold?

226
00:11:19,441 --> 00:11:21,002
It's my fault.

227
00:11:21,561 --> 00:11:23,522
I failed to control her.

228
00:11:23,961 --> 00:11:25,441
Before, she told me

229
00:11:25,544 --> 00:11:26,865
that she and Mr. Jiang

230
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:28,371
had feelings for each other,

231
00:11:29,153 --> 00:11:29,834
so I...

232
00:11:30,412 --> 00:11:32,211
I didn't discipline her properly.

233
00:11:32,602 --> 00:11:35,201
She has been losing weight.

234
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:36,970
It reminds me of

235
00:11:37,762 --> 00:11:39,522
the days when I was missing you.

236
00:11:39,681 --> 00:11:41,321
I couldn't see her upset,

237
00:11:41,372 --> 00:11:43,052
so I didn't stop her.

238
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,800
But when I found out Mr. Jiang

239
00:11:45,858 --> 00:11:47,258
was going to be betrothed to Yining,

240
00:11:47,571 --> 00:11:49,370
I warned her

241
00:11:49,395 --> 00:11:51,801
to break things off with him.

242
00:11:53,242 --> 00:11:54,441
I was being careless

243
00:11:54,576 --> 00:11:56,040
and failed to discipline her properly.

244
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,561
Please punish me, my dear.

245
00:11:59,681 --> 00:12:00,801
How could I bear

246
00:12:01,482 --> 00:12:02,882
to punish you?

247
00:12:05,441 --> 00:12:06,201
Yuechan,

248
00:12:06,482 --> 00:12:09,282
you are too kind.

249
00:12:09,436 --> 00:12:12,276
But sometimes, kindness can ruin things.

250
00:12:12,832 --> 00:12:14,560
You've been managing household affairs

251
00:12:14,762 --> 00:12:17,002
while looking after Lian and Xuanyuan.

252
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:18,841
It has been tough for you.

253
00:12:19,482 --> 00:12:21,961
My dear, it's not tough at all.

254
00:12:23,362 --> 00:12:24,561
I have already

255
00:12:24,586 --> 00:12:25,586
punished Lian.

256
00:12:25,961 --> 00:12:28,307
She learned the lesson.

257
00:12:28,602 --> 00:12:29,961
It's also my fault

258
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,040
that Old Madam fell sick.

259
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,201
I'm willing to chant scriptures
300 times

260
00:12:33,234 --> 00:12:34,434
to pray for her well-being.

261
00:12:35,801 --> 00:12:38,122
Fortunately,
this matter is kept contained.

262
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,440
Besides, Mother's condition

263
00:12:39,586 --> 00:12:40,905
is stable.

264
00:12:41,282 --> 00:12:42,282
But

265
00:12:43,681 --> 00:12:45,041
that's the last one.

266
00:12:45,961 --> 00:12:46,681
My dear,

267
00:12:46,841 --> 00:12:48,801
I will teach Lian properly.

268
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,920
She won't repeat the same mistake.

269
00:12:53,002 --> 00:12:53,762
Yuechan.

270
00:12:57,282 --> 00:12:59,681
You, Lian, and Xuanyuan

271
00:13:00,641 --> 00:13:02,401
are the most important ones to me.

272
00:13:03,242 --> 00:13:04,321
Don't worry

273
00:13:04,801 --> 00:13:05,882
about Lian's marriage.

274
00:13:06,681 --> 00:13:08,242
I will take care of that.

275
00:13:11,801 --> 00:13:12,441
Mother.

276
00:13:12,556 --> 00:13:14,115
Yining, you are here.

277
00:13:14,762 --> 00:13:16,642
I investigated all the servants

278
00:13:16,707 --> 00:13:19,053
and found that the person gossiping
in Old Madam's place was

279
00:13:19,213 --> 00:13:20,733
Yue from my abode.

280
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:23,801
What was your maid doing

281
00:13:23,826 --> 00:13:25,346
in Muxi Hall?

282
00:13:25,681 --> 00:13:28,201
Yue always tends to the plants,

283
00:13:28,321 --> 00:13:30,102
so I sent her to Muxi Hall

284
00:13:30,127 --> 00:13:31,566
to look after Old Madam's peonies.

285
00:13:31,921 --> 00:13:33,642
She was talking nonsense there

286
00:13:33,667 --> 00:13:35,387
and annoyed Old Madam.

287
00:13:36,561 --> 00:13:38,041
Maids in your abode

288
00:13:38,066 --> 00:13:39,625
are very reliable.

289
00:13:39,921 --> 00:13:42,242
Why was she gossiping in Muxi Hall?

290
00:13:43,721 --> 00:13:46,242
Something seems fishy.

291
00:13:48,402 --> 00:13:49,522
Are you saying

292
00:13:50,201 --> 00:13:51,602
that she was being used?

293
00:13:54,037 --> 00:13:55,041
It must be Mistress Qiao.

294
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,241
I must go and confront her.

295
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,520
Mother, don't go just yet.

296
00:13:57,715 --> 00:13:59,195
Please sit down and calm yourself.

297
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:03,482
Think about this. Mistress Qiao

298
00:14:03,602 --> 00:14:04,961
went through all this trouble

299
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,441
just to set up your maid.

300
00:14:06,841 --> 00:14:09,345
It's because she intended
to rid herself of blame.

301
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,719
If we confront her now,

302
00:14:10,937 --> 00:14:12,922
she will definitely pretend
to be innocent

303
00:14:13,162 --> 00:14:14,961
and make you look bad.

304
00:14:16,162 --> 00:14:17,242
You have a point.

305
00:14:17,801 --> 00:14:19,961
I can't fall into her trap.

306
00:14:21,002 --> 00:14:23,482
But what should I do?

307
00:14:26,681 --> 00:14:29,346
Who was talking to Yue at that time?

308
00:14:29,841 --> 00:14:31,041
She said

309
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:33,801
it was an old maid

310
00:14:33,826 --> 00:14:36,067
who served in Muxi Hall. She's called

311
00:14:36,602 --> 00:14:37,441
Ms. Lyu.

312
00:14:38,323 --> 00:14:38,962
By the way,

313
00:14:39,314 --> 00:14:41,114
I had someone transcribe

314
00:14:41,362 --> 00:14:43,122
Yue's confession. Take a look at this

315
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,400
and see if it's suspicious.

316
00:14:49,122 --> 00:14:51,041
Ms. Lyu is strange.

317
00:14:51,282 --> 00:14:52,522
Her topics seem to revolve

318
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,736
around the marriage
between the Luo and Jiang Families.

319
00:14:54,762 --> 00:14:57,027
She kept mentioning
that Grandma holds me dear

320
00:14:57,441 --> 00:14:59,602
and that I would marry
as a principal wife.

321
00:15:00,081 --> 00:15:02,882
She seems to be tempting Yue
to retort against her by saying

322
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,544
that I'd actually marry
as a concubine.

323
00:15:05,376 --> 00:15:06,720
Yue also mentioned that Ms. Lyu

324
00:15:06,746 --> 00:15:08,523
kept broaching the topic that Old Madam

325
00:15:08,561 --> 00:15:09,762
was worried about your marriage,

326
00:15:09,811 --> 00:15:11,171
which is why she responded to her.

327
00:15:11,482 --> 00:15:14,041
Also, why did Ms. Lyu
choose the moment

328
00:15:14,162 --> 00:15:16,841
just when Grandma showed up
to bring up this topic?

329
00:15:18,602 --> 00:15:20,041
The problem is,

330
00:15:20,882 --> 00:15:22,162
there's nothing

331
00:15:22,187 --> 00:15:23,227
to nitpick

332
00:15:23,323 --> 00:15:24,523
from this conversation per se.

333
00:15:25,122 --> 00:15:26,859
They would only be punished

334
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:28,165
for gossiping about the master.

335
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:29,642
Do you mean

336
00:15:29,961 --> 00:15:31,081
that someone

337
00:15:31,441 --> 00:15:32,841
brided Ms. Lyu?

338
00:15:33,002 --> 00:15:34,441
That's possible.

339
00:15:35,282 --> 00:15:35,921
Qing Qu,

340
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,399
go and investigate Ms. Lyu.

341
00:15:38,624 --> 00:15:39,360
Yes, Young Lady.

342
00:16:23,362 --> 00:16:24,482
Ms. Qing Qu,

343
00:16:25,002 --> 00:16:26,162
what are you doing here?

344
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,400
And what are you doing here?

345
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,080
I'm looking for Ms. Lyu.

346
00:16:29,104 --> 00:16:30,850
I went to several places
but couldn't find her.

347
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:31,857
Is she in this room?

348
00:16:33,002 --> 00:16:34,762
Why are you looking for Ms. Lyu?

349
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:37,162
Young Master sent me to ask her

350
00:16:37,242 --> 00:16:38,882
if Old Madam likes the plant

351
00:16:38,907 --> 00:16:40,147
he gave.

352
00:16:42,602 --> 00:16:44,762
Don't look at me like that.

353
00:16:45,602 --> 00:16:47,762
Everyone in this residence

354
00:16:47,787 --> 00:16:49,387
wants to please Old Madam.

355
00:16:49,921 --> 00:16:51,201
Besides, Ms. Lyu is the only one

356
00:16:51,226 --> 00:16:52,826
who's amiable.

357
00:16:53,049 --> 00:16:54,009
Not just us,

358
00:16:54,482 --> 00:16:57,162
but others also seek her help.

359
00:16:57,282 --> 00:16:58,402
In that case,

360
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:01,242
Ms. Lyu is quite popular.

361
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:02,522
Indeed.

362
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,919
I also heard that Mistress Qiao

363
00:17:04,944 --> 00:17:07,170
recommended Ms. Lyu's son
for a job under her brother.

364
00:17:08,562 --> 00:17:09,842
Really?

365
00:17:13,281 --> 00:17:15,281
By the way, Ms. Lyu isn't here.

366
00:17:16,042 --> 00:17:18,001
Then, I will try other places.

367
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:34,322
Young Master.

368
00:17:35,872 --> 00:17:37,320
Have you got the message through?

369
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:38,530
Yes.

370
00:17:39,162 --> 00:17:39,761
Young Master,

371
00:17:40,001 --> 00:17:42,521
you helped Seventh Lady
since you returned.

372
00:17:42,576 --> 00:17:43,800
But she doesn't know this at all.

373
00:17:43,921 --> 00:17:45,162
We won't have a chance to borrow

374
00:17:45,187 --> 00:17:46,468
Old Master's paintings from her.

375
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,480
Are you purely trying

376
00:17:49,761 --> 00:17:51,681
to help Seventh Lady?

377
00:17:53,721 --> 00:17:54,761
Keep an eye on Li Yinglong.

378
00:17:55,872 --> 00:17:56,730
Yes, Young Master.

379
00:18:06,882 --> 00:18:08,362
It's oriental sweetgum.

380
00:18:11,602 --> 00:18:13,642
Mistress Qiao is so cruel.

381
00:18:13,961 --> 00:18:15,562
She dares to harm Old Madam.

382
00:18:22,681 --> 00:18:23,441
Mistress Qiao.

383
00:18:27,642 --> 00:18:28,481
Why are you afraid?

384
00:18:28,761 --> 00:18:30,201
Even if they detained her,

385
00:18:30,362 --> 00:18:31,761
as long as she doesn't admit it,

386
00:18:31,882 --> 00:18:33,402
no one can accuse her.

387
00:18:33,761 --> 00:18:35,481
You are right, Mistress Qiao.

388
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,080
Mistress Qiao, Madam Lin wants you

389
00:18:40,105 --> 00:18:41,345
to head to Muxi Hall now.

390
00:18:42,122 --> 00:18:43,441
Did she say why?

391
00:18:43,761 --> 00:18:45,122
She only asks for you.

392
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:46,320
Second Madam is there, too.

393
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:49,082
Tell her I'm coming.

394
00:18:49,481 --> 00:18:50,042
Yes.

395
00:19:01,481 --> 00:19:02,082
Father,

396
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:05,402
Grandma's health
is an important matter in the residence.

397
00:19:05,802 --> 00:19:08,201
We have been
a scholarly family for generations.

398
00:19:08,681 --> 00:19:09,721
We are well known

399
00:19:09,779 --> 00:19:12,378
for being an example
of adhering to ethics and rules.

400
00:19:12,602 --> 00:19:14,001
However, someone in this residence

401
00:19:14,026 --> 00:19:16,145
is spreading rumors,

402
00:19:16,402 --> 00:19:18,122
causing big trouble.

403
00:19:18,362 --> 00:19:20,481
I hope you can investigate this
thoroughly

404
00:19:20,506 --> 00:19:21,785
and give Grandma an explanation.

405
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:24,042
Of course.

406
00:19:24,322 --> 00:19:25,122
However,

407
00:19:25,961 --> 00:19:27,481
isn't Yue

408
00:19:27,721 --> 00:19:29,562
the maid from Madam Lin's abode?

409
00:19:29,882 --> 00:19:31,681
I heard she has been punished.

410
00:19:32,402 --> 00:19:35,441
Why? Is there another story behind it?

411
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:38,842
There's another clue

412
00:19:38,867 --> 00:19:40,147
I wouldn't dare to hide.

413
00:19:40,802 --> 00:19:42,802
It concerns Mistress Qiao,

414
00:19:43,201 --> 00:19:45,521
so I invited her here.

415
00:19:45,961 --> 00:19:48,001
What does this have to do with her?

416
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,640
Whether it relates to her,

417
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:51,281
we will find out later.

418
00:20:02,681 --> 00:20:04,481
Greetings, Second Master.

419
00:20:05,721 --> 00:20:07,241
Greetings, Madam Lin.

420
00:20:07,842 --> 00:20:08,602
Yuechan...

421
00:20:11,122 --> 00:20:11,761
Yue!

422
00:20:12,402 --> 00:20:13,001
Yue,

423
00:20:13,562 --> 00:20:15,082
were you and Ms. Lyu there

424
00:20:15,241 --> 00:20:17,241
when Old Madam fainted?

425
00:20:18,042 --> 00:20:18,761
Yes.

426
00:20:19,681 --> 00:20:21,402
But I didn't mean for that to happen.

427
00:20:21,842 --> 00:20:23,802
Ms. Lyu brought up the topic.

428
00:20:23,872 --> 00:20:26,256
She insisted on bending my ears
about Seventh Lady's marriage.

429
00:20:26,304 --> 00:20:28,000
I didn't want to respond to her,

430
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,320
but she kept talking,

431
00:20:29,802 --> 00:20:31,921
especially when Old Madam came

432
00:20:31,946 --> 00:20:33,425
to check on her plants.

433
00:20:33,642 --> 00:20:35,362
I didn't. You are lying.

434
00:20:35,457 --> 00:20:37,578
You were talkative.
Don't blame me for that.

435
00:20:41,122 --> 00:20:41,882
Ms. Lyu,

436
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:44,602
this bag of silver taels

437
00:20:44,657 --> 00:20:46,417
was found in your room.

438
00:20:47,322 --> 00:20:49,042
There are over ten silver taels.

439
00:20:50,402 --> 00:20:51,802
How could a maid

440
00:20:51,961 --> 00:20:53,642
have so much money?

441
00:20:53,921 --> 00:20:55,122
Did you steal it?

442
00:20:55,328 --> 00:20:56,280
No, I didn't steal it.

443
00:20:57,761 --> 00:21:00,201
Or did someone bribe you

444
00:21:00,236 --> 00:21:01,476
to pass the message to Grandma

445
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,720
through Yue

446
00:21:02,815 --> 00:21:04,175
and cause her to fall sick?

447
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:06,441
That's not true. The money...

448
00:21:06,802 --> 00:21:08,201
The money was given by my son.

449
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,321
He learns to do business outside

450
00:21:10,348 --> 00:21:11,348
and has made some money.

451
00:21:12,602 --> 00:21:14,842
- Your son gave you this?
- Yes.

452
00:21:15,259 --> 00:21:16,499
Why did this pouch

453
00:21:16,721 --> 00:21:18,761
smell like oriental sweetgum?

454
00:21:19,281 --> 00:21:20,241
I remember

455
00:21:20,481 --> 00:21:21,921
Mistress Qiao's abode

456
00:21:22,362 --> 00:21:24,402
uses this incense, right?

457
00:21:27,721 --> 00:21:28,402
Father.

458
00:21:38,402 --> 00:21:39,721
I'm wronged.

459
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:43,441
The oriental sweetgum

460
00:21:43,546 --> 00:21:44,986
isn't exclusive to me.

461
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:46,016
Why are all of you

462
00:21:46,241 --> 00:21:48,921
suddenly accusing me now?

463
00:21:51,402 --> 00:21:52,761
If I have wronged you,

464
00:21:52,882 --> 00:21:54,521
let me ask you this.

465
00:21:55,122 --> 00:21:56,642
Is Ms. Lyu's son following

466
00:21:56,674 --> 00:21:58,515
Fifth Master Qiao to learn to do business?

467
00:21:59,122 --> 00:22:00,122
Is Fifth Master Qiao

468
00:22:00,154 --> 00:22:01,834
your younger brother?

469
00:22:02,842 --> 00:22:04,961
He is my brother,

470
00:22:05,481 --> 00:22:07,481
but I have no idea

471
00:22:07,635 --> 00:22:09,476
about his business.

472
00:22:12,322 --> 00:22:13,761
But I heard

473
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:15,562
that you recommended Ms. Lyu's son

474
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:17,331
for a job under him.

475
00:22:17,435 --> 00:22:18,996
What do you mean?

476
00:22:19,721 --> 00:22:20,402
Father,

477
00:22:20,681 --> 00:22:22,441
to get to the bottom of this,

478
00:22:22,554 --> 00:22:24,660
we can ask a few people to find out.

479
00:22:26,481 --> 00:22:28,122
There's no need to make a fuss

480
00:22:28,402 --> 00:22:30,042
over something without evidence.

481
00:22:30,402 --> 00:22:32,042
The priority now is

482
00:22:32,162 --> 00:22:34,761
for your grandma to wake up soon.

483
00:22:35,122 --> 00:22:35,842
Father,

484
00:22:36,122 --> 00:22:38,882
perhaps someone
is secretly plotting this.

485
00:22:39,001 --> 00:22:40,921
It may seem unintentional,

486
00:22:41,042 --> 00:22:43,481
but in fact, everything is well-planned.

487
00:22:47,402 --> 00:22:48,562
I'm innocent.

488
00:22:48,672 --> 00:22:50,720
It's my fault
for not disciplining the servants.

489
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:52,122
But I would definitely not

490
00:22:52,147 --> 00:22:53,627
commit such a ridiculous mistake

491
00:22:53,652 --> 00:22:55,493
to harm Old Madam.

492
00:22:56,122 --> 00:22:57,322
Perhaps Seventh Lady

493
00:22:57,347 --> 00:22:58,708
still holds grudges against me

494
00:22:58,733 --> 00:23:00,013
for what happened back then.

495
00:23:00,361 --> 00:23:01,520
Still, you can't

496
00:23:01,642 --> 00:23:03,162
slander me.

497
00:23:05,281 --> 00:23:06,761
You seem guilty.

498
00:23:07,042 --> 00:23:09,506
You won't stop bringing up the past.

499
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:12,362
You know very well

500
00:23:12,521 --> 00:23:14,162
what the truth is.

501
00:23:14,225 --> 00:23:15,225
Enough.

502
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:17,399
Father,

503
00:23:17,842 --> 00:23:19,882
we must adhere to the family rules.

504
00:23:20,001 --> 00:23:21,882
Grandma's safety is at stake.

505
00:23:22,122 --> 00:23:23,842
Please investigate this thoroughly.

506
00:23:24,466 --> 00:23:31,387
♪I'm willing to fall into the abyss
in order to reveal the fate♪

507
00:23:34,082 --> 00:23:35,441
It's far-fetched

508
00:23:35,466 --> 00:23:36,426
that Mistress Qiao

509
00:23:37,281 --> 00:23:38,921
egged on Ms. Lyu.

510
00:23:41,162 --> 00:23:42,602
However, Mistress Qiao

511
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,120
failed to discipline the servants.

512
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:46,208
She should be held accountable
for this incident.

513
00:23:47,402 --> 00:23:48,402
Mistress Qiao

514
00:23:55,824 --> 00:23:57,040
is to be confined for a month.

515
00:24:00,082 --> 00:24:00,642
Well.

516
00:24:01,082 --> 00:24:03,721
That's all for this matter.

517
00:24:04,761 --> 00:24:05,402
Father,

518
00:24:05,802 --> 00:24:08,122
I'm afraid it's inappropriate
for Mistress Qiao

519
00:24:08,122 --> 00:24:09,590
to continue managing household affairs.

520
00:24:09,642 --> 00:24:10,921
This matter

521
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:12,090
may be pursued

522
00:24:12,362 --> 00:24:13,882
when Grandma wakes up.

523
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:16,961
Second Master,

524
00:24:17,324 --> 00:24:19,925
I also think it's inappropriate.

525
00:24:21,122 --> 00:24:23,322
We must give Old Madam
an explanation of this.

526
00:24:26,761 --> 00:24:27,842
Mother is seriously ill.

527
00:24:28,241 --> 00:24:29,162
We can't disturb her

528
00:24:30,322 --> 00:24:32,122
over a trivial matter like this.

529
00:24:34,042 --> 00:24:35,042
As such,

530
00:24:36,241 --> 00:24:37,362
I will hand over the authority

531
00:24:40,373 --> 00:24:41,694
of the household management to you.

532
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:44,001
What did you say?

533
00:24:44,416 --> 00:24:47,136
I say I'll hand over the authority
of the household management to you.

534
00:24:48,982 --> 00:24:50,341
All right.

535
00:24:51,692 --> 00:24:52,651
Second Master...

536
00:24:53,042 --> 00:24:53,882
Yuechan,

537
00:24:54,732 --> 00:24:56,131
sort out the ledgers.

538
00:24:56,642 --> 00:24:57,961
Once Mother wakes up,

539
00:24:58,481 --> 00:24:59,926
hand over the keys

540
00:25:00,001 --> 00:25:02,162
to Madam Lin.

541
00:25:09,082 --> 00:25:10,961
Listen carefully, everyone.

542
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,481
If anyone dares to gossip

543
00:25:13,521 --> 00:25:14,842
or spread rumors in Muxi Hall

544
00:25:14,961 --> 00:25:17,281
to disturb my mother again,

545
00:25:17,441 --> 00:25:19,481
they will be punished with fifty flogs
without mercy

546
00:25:19,562 --> 00:25:22,562
and sent to the farm.

547
00:25:23,921 --> 00:25:24,882
Yes.

548
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,231
(Caifu Abode)

549
00:25:32,146 --> 00:25:34,418
Mother, stop pacing.

550
00:25:34,482 --> 00:25:35,207
Yining,

551
00:25:36,402 --> 00:25:37,441
pinch me.

552
00:25:37,658 --> 00:25:38,698
Is this a dream?

553
00:25:38,832 --> 00:25:41,560
Did your father really give me
the authority to manage the household?

554
00:25:42,042 --> 00:25:43,402
It's true.

555
00:25:45,162 --> 00:25:46,642
Oh, heavens.

556
00:25:46,873 --> 00:25:48,193
I can't believe

557
00:25:48,218 --> 00:25:49,777
this will happen to me

558
00:25:50,122 --> 00:25:52,122
at this age.

559
00:25:54,921 --> 00:25:55,761
Mother,

560
00:25:56,201 --> 00:25:58,882
I believe you are more than capable
of managing the entire residence.

561
00:26:00,241 --> 00:26:02,082
Honestly, I had never thought of

562
00:26:02,241 --> 00:26:03,842
competing with her over the years.

563
00:26:04,042 --> 00:26:06,281
But I didn't expect her

564
00:26:06,602 --> 00:26:09,001
to bring harm to Old Madam.

565
00:26:09,241 --> 00:26:12,082
Besides, she even tried
to frame Caifu Abode.

566
00:26:12,281 --> 00:26:13,721
I'm not incompetent.

567
00:26:13,882 --> 00:26:15,001
I just think

568
00:26:15,122 --> 00:26:16,162
the competition

569
00:26:16,322 --> 00:26:17,481
is pointless.

570
00:26:18,802 --> 00:26:21,001
Since we have a new head,

571
00:26:21,122 --> 00:26:22,802
new rules should be established.

572
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:45,473
♪South wind weaves
a brocade tapestry of lives♪

573
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:50,129
♪Begonias lean on each other
in front of the turquoise pond♪

574
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:57,293
♪The tea fragrance wafts
along the long street♪

575
00:26:58,786 --> 00:27:03,856
♪A bright heart will radiate the world♪

576
00:27:05,162 --> 00:27:05,961
Grandma,

577
00:27:06,802 --> 00:27:08,082
you are awake.

578
00:27:09,921 --> 00:27:11,481
Is this a dream?

579
00:27:12,001 --> 00:27:13,322
No.

580
00:27:13,681 --> 00:27:15,842
I'm watching you.

581
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,879
Help me sit up.

582
00:27:20,922 --> 00:27:22,442
Slowly.

583
00:27:23,603 --> 00:27:26,123
I want to get up now

584
00:27:26,441 --> 00:27:28,322
to ask your father.

585
00:27:29,441 --> 00:27:31,201
I want to ask him if

586
00:27:31,842 --> 00:27:35,001
he was out of his mind

587
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,639
to agree to marry you off
as a concubine.

588
00:27:38,842 --> 00:27:39,562
Grandma,

589
00:27:39,761 --> 00:27:42,281
the Jiang Family intended to take me
as a concubine.

590
00:27:42,602 --> 00:27:45,241
But Father personally went

591
00:27:45,402 --> 00:27:47,122
to turn it down.

592
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:48,895
Really?

593
00:27:49,082 --> 00:27:49,882
Yes.

594
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,440
Finally, your father

595
00:27:55,721 --> 00:27:58,721
is behaving like a father now.

596
00:27:58,921 --> 00:27:59,842
Think about this.

597
00:28:00,122 --> 00:28:02,521
The legitimate daughter

598
00:28:02,926 --> 00:28:04,206
of the Luo Residence

599
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:06,293
is going to be someone's concubine?

600
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,879
If this gets out,

601
00:28:08,162 --> 00:28:10,481
we will become a laughing stock.

602
00:28:10,761 --> 00:28:12,162
Shame!

603
00:28:14,362 --> 00:28:15,721
Grandma,

604
00:28:15,921 --> 00:28:18,681
don't always believe
in everything you hear.

605
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,120
You can wait for me

606
00:28:21,322 --> 00:28:22,402
and explain it to you,

607
00:28:22,521 --> 00:28:23,241
all right?

608
00:28:25,201 --> 00:28:26,842
All right.

609
00:28:27,082 --> 00:28:28,162
You must be thirsty.

610
00:28:40,842 --> 00:28:41,602
Grandma,

611
00:28:42,281 --> 00:28:43,882
Ms. Lyu from your abode

612
00:28:44,082 --> 00:28:44,882
isn't honest.

613
00:28:45,201 --> 00:28:46,802
I have sent her away.

614
00:28:47,122 --> 00:28:49,082
Mistress Qiao failed in her duty

615
00:28:49,201 --> 00:28:50,521
to keep the servants in check.

616
00:28:51,082 --> 00:28:53,441
Father has handed over the authority
of household management

617
00:28:53,642 --> 00:28:54,802
to Mother.

618
00:28:57,481 --> 00:29:00,921
He favors Mistress Qiao very much.

619
00:29:01,162 --> 00:29:03,042
I can't believe he changed his mind.

620
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:07,402
Wonders never cease.

621
00:29:08,521 --> 00:29:11,122
You have always worried that Mother is

622
00:29:11,184 --> 00:29:12,960
on the downtrodden side
in this residence.

623
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:14,681
Given the current situation,

624
00:29:14,706 --> 00:29:16,345
Father can't deny it.

625
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
If Hairu takes control

626
00:29:19,242 --> 00:29:21,283
of the household management

627
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,399
and handles this job perfectly,

628
00:29:24,602 --> 00:29:27,802
it would be a crutch for her
in the future.

629
00:29:28,162 --> 00:29:30,761
That's very good.

630
00:29:31,521 --> 00:29:32,042
Yes.

631
00:29:32,802 --> 00:29:35,441
Mother is frank

632
00:29:35,602 --> 00:29:36,802
and sincere,

633
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:40,240
and she cares about you.

634
00:29:40,761 --> 00:29:42,842
That's more reassuring.

635
00:29:46,527 --> 00:29:49,207
My Yining has really grown up.

636
00:29:49,562 --> 00:29:52,441
You are no longer the little girl
anyone can manipulate.

637
00:29:52,466 --> 00:29:53,306
That's right.

638
00:29:53,721 --> 00:29:55,961
If Mistress Qiao hadn't gone overboard,

639
00:29:56,122 --> 00:29:58,042
I wouldn't have been so harsh on her.

640
00:29:59,602 --> 00:30:00,642
Ning,

641
00:30:00,921 --> 00:30:03,238
I'm concerned about you.

642
00:30:03,335 --> 00:30:07,162
You have endured so much alone.

643
00:30:07,187 --> 00:30:08,468
Sweetheart, listen.

644
00:30:08,961 --> 00:30:11,602
Let the past be the past.

645
00:30:12,082 --> 00:30:13,842
Before your mother passed on,

646
00:30:13,911 --> 00:30:15,510
she told me

647
00:30:16,042 --> 00:30:17,201
that she only wanted you

648
00:30:17,721 --> 00:30:21,001
to have an easy life.

649
00:30:22,681 --> 00:30:23,602
Grandma.

650
00:30:23,882 --> 00:30:26,481
Ning, sit here.

651
00:30:29,562 --> 00:30:30,681
Ning, dear,

652
00:30:31,441 --> 00:30:34,562
I only hope you can

653
00:30:34,681 --> 00:30:36,961
have a peaceful life.

654
00:30:37,481 --> 00:30:39,241
Find a fine man

655
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:41,721
who cherishes you,

656
00:30:41,882 --> 00:30:43,521
and to have children by your side.

657
00:30:44,322 --> 00:30:47,562
Even if I were to die tomorrow,

658
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,120
I have no regrets.

659
00:30:50,562 --> 00:30:51,362
Grandma,

660
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,480
don't talk nonsense.

661
00:30:54,362 --> 00:30:56,362
I would rather not marry

662
00:30:56,387 --> 00:30:57,708
and stay beside you

663
00:30:57,961 --> 00:30:59,201
to take care of you.

664
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,400
My sweet girl.

665
00:31:13,499 --> 00:31:16,772
(Chengjing Hall)

666
00:31:41,538 --> 00:31:42,217
Get up.

667
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,281
Previously,

668
00:31:51,521 --> 00:31:53,802
Madam Lin has been

669
00:31:53,827 --> 00:31:56,775
looking after me.

670
00:31:57,356 --> 00:31:59,517
That's why the household management

671
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:01,103
was temporarily entrusted

672
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:03,298
to Mistress Qiao.

673
00:32:03,572 --> 00:32:04,572
From now on,

674
00:32:05,441 --> 00:32:07,281
this authority

675
00:32:07,306 --> 00:32:10,185
should be returned to Madam Lin.

676
00:32:10,848 --> 00:32:12,740
Having a concubine
to manage household affairs

677
00:32:12,766 --> 00:32:15,847
is simply ludicrous if people find out.

678
00:32:24,742 --> 00:32:27,901
In the future, all the ledgers

679
00:32:28,241 --> 00:32:29,761
and expenses

680
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,504
must go through Madam Lin.

681
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,721
All the maidservants,

682
00:32:34,914 --> 00:32:36,394
if you need anything,

683
00:32:36,602 --> 00:32:38,761
you must report to Madam Lin.

684
00:32:39,842 --> 00:32:40,961
Yes.

685
00:32:41,987 --> 00:32:44,107
Get up.

686
00:32:47,526 --> 00:32:48,605
Hairu,

687
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:51,839
it will be a tough task for you.

688
00:32:52,761 --> 00:32:54,402
I will try my best

689
00:32:54,873 --> 00:32:56,233
not to disappoint you, Mother.

690
00:33:07,122 --> 00:33:07,882
Hairu,

691
00:33:08,322 --> 00:33:11,001
since the keys have been
passed on to you,

692
00:33:11,058 --> 00:33:13,937
we can dismiss the meeting.

693
00:33:15,057 --> 00:33:17,402
As you entrusted me with the task,

694
00:33:17,721 --> 00:33:18,961
from today on,

695
00:33:19,107 --> 00:33:22,201
I will establish new rules for you.

696
00:33:23,122 --> 00:33:24,602
What do you think, Mistress Qiao?

697
00:33:28,642 --> 00:33:30,842
You are right, Madam Lin.

698
00:33:31,034 --> 00:33:33,274
I shall do as you say.

699
00:33:34,402 --> 00:33:36,642
Let's begin
with daily greeting practice.

700
00:33:36,961 --> 00:33:38,562
You may start
the daily greeting practice

701
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:40,690
once your confinement ends.

702
00:33:41,562 --> 00:33:42,802
Daily greeting practice?

703
00:33:45,642 --> 00:33:47,721
You are right.

704
00:33:48,114 --> 00:33:51,281
I should've done this earlier.

705
00:33:51,306 --> 00:33:52,986
But I'm weak,

706
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,720
and Chengzhang is concerned for me,

707
00:33:54,746 --> 00:33:56,946
so he permitted me to skip it.

708
00:34:01,642 --> 00:34:03,842
Mistress Qiao, you are weak

709
00:34:03,867 --> 00:34:05,188
because you lack exercise.

710
00:34:05,602 --> 00:34:07,921
This is Madam Lin's
daily routine schedule.

711
00:34:07,946 --> 00:34:12,589
Please follow everything on it closely.

712
00:34:53,744 --> 00:34:55,280
At three-quarters past the Yin hour,

713
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,521
the concubine must prepare water
for washing up.

714
00:34:58,128 --> 00:34:59,550
Three-quarters past the Yin hour?

715
00:35:00,401 --> 00:35:01,962
The sky is still dark,

716
00:35:02,361 --> 00:35:04,401
and the rooster hasn't even crowed.

717
00:35:05,281 --> 00:35:07,482
Madam Lin wakes up at the Mao hour
every day.

718
00:35:07,922 --> 00:35:10,321
If you don't wait
at the Caifu Abode earlier,

719
00:35:10,482 --> 00:35:13,201
do you expect Madam Lin
to serve you instead?

720
00:35:15,424 --> 00:35:17,920
Starting from Mao hour, the concubine
will assist the principal wife

721
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:21,072
with washing up, getting changed, and having
breakfast until the latter retires for the night,

722
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:22,688
and the former is free to return to rest.

723
00:35:22,698 --> 00:35:24,962
When the principal wife is attending
to household affairs,

724
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,809
the concubine must wait upon her,

725
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:28,859
serving tea, filling empty cups,
massaging, and fanning.

726
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,530
When the principal wife
goes out on a carriage,

727
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:32,211
the concubine needs
to follow her on foot.

728
00:35:32,507 --> 00:35:34,347
When the principal wife
scolds the concubine,

729
00:35:34,372 --> 00:35:36,689
the latter must kneel and listen to her
and not talk back.

730
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:38,128
Without the principal wife's permission,

731
00:35:38,176 --> 00:35:40,928
the concubine is not allowed to leave
the residence or meet any guests.

732
00:35:43,201 --> 00:35:44,082
Madam Lin...

733
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:46,650
This is too much, Hairu.

734
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,120
I believe Mistress Qiao has predicted
this day would come

735
00:35:53,194 --> 00:35:54,835
when she chose this path back then.

736
00:35:55,522 --> 00:35:58,002
I was too generous to her,

737
00:35:58,201 --> 00:35:59,281
and that made her forget

738
00:35:59,475 --> 00:36:01,274
how to behave like a concubine.

739
00:36:02,042 --> 00:36:02,801
My dear,

740
00:36:03,435 --> 00:36:04,754
have you forgotten it, too?

741
00:36:17,314 --> 00:36:18,075
Whatever.

742
00:36:20,407 --> 00:36:22,128
Do you have any objections,
Mistress Qiao?

743
00:36:25,042 --> 00:36:26,361
No, I don't.

744
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:33,442
Keep the book well.

745
00:36:33,746 --> 00:36:35,146
You can study it carefully

746
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,800
while you are being grounded.

747
00:36:41,506 --> 00:36:42,305
Ms. Li.

748
00:36:43,002 --> 00:36:43,881
Yes, Madam Lin.

749
00:36:44,043 --> 00:36:45,802
Bring all the ledgers to my room

750
00:36:45,827 --> 00:36:46,947
first thing in the morning.

751
00:36:47,179 --> 00:36:48,420
Don't miss a single ledger.

752
00:36:49,401 --> 00:36:50,801
Yes, Madam Lin.

753
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,280
(Caifu Abode)

754
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:13,160
Yining, thank you so much for today.

755
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,890
I finally can get my resentments
off my chest

756
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:16,608
after being oppressed by her
over these years.

757
00:37:16,761 --> 00:37:18,321
I'm also happy for you.

758
00:37:18,912 --> 00:37:21,320
What do you want to eat?
I will order the kitchen to prepare.

759
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,679
What else do you want?

760
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,679
I can bring them to you.

761
00:37:24,361 --> 00:37:26,562
Mother, there's nothing I want.

762
00:37:26,801 --> 00:37:28,482
But I have a favor

763
00:37:28,507 --> 00:37:29,546
to ask of you, Mother.

764
00:37:29,962 --> 00:37:31,602
What's it?

765
00:37:32,256 --> 00:37:33,800
I want to send Shenyuan's allowance

766
00:37:33,826 --> 00:37:35,786
to him.

767
00:37:39,721 --> 00:37:40,321
Third Brother,

768
00:37:41,122 --> 00:37:42,482
are you studying?

769
00:37:43,642 --> 00:37:45,002
Why are you calling me that?

770
00:37:45,442 --> 00:37:47,002
You are also Father's son.

771
00:37:47,035 --> 00:37:48,955
Naturally, I will call you brother.

772
00:37:49,361 --> 00:37:51,201
Do you not like it?

773
00:37:51,962 --> 00:37:52,761
Seventh Sister.

774
00:37:53,801 --> 00:37:55,122
How's Old Madam?

775
00:37:55,172 --> 00:37:56,810
She is out and about.

776
00:37:59,241 --> 00:38:00,886
This time, I came here

777
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,320
to bring you this month's allowance.

778
00:38:02,462 --> 00:38:03,782
Mother is in charge now,

779
00:38:04,217 --> 00:38:07,122
so you will receive a sufficient amount
from this month onward.

780
00:38:09,042 --> 00:38:10,241
That's very thoughtful of you.

781
00:38:10,639 --> 00:38:11,918
A favor for a favor.

782
00:38:12,562 --> 00:38:14,401
Mother is fair.

783
00:38:14,475 --> 00:38:16,602
If anything is lacking here,

784
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:18,571
just tell Mother.

785
00:38:18,721 --> 00:38:20,361
I will. Thank you.

786
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,680
I will take my leave.

787
00:38:32,681 --> 00:38:33,881
It seems Seventh Lady

788
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,320
has noticed we helped her.

789
00:38:35,721 --> 00:38:37,519
She keeps calling you brother just now.

790
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:38,241
So?

791
00:38:38,881 --> 00:38:39,482
Young Master,

792
00:38:39,761 --> 00:38:41,271
why don't you take this opportunity

793
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,576
to borrow Old Master's paintings?

794
00:38:42,624 --> 00:38:43,600
You are indeed a daft...

795
00:38:47,281 --> 00:38:47,841
Young Master.

796
00:38:49,002 --> 00:38:50,042
Get ready for tonight.

797
00:38:50,401 --> 00:38:51,721
Where are we going tonight?

798
00:38:52,321 --> 00:38:53,321
Bring the tea.

799
00:38:58,361 --> 00:38:58,881
Young Lady,

800
00:38:59,881 --> 00:39:02,642
what do you mean
by "a favor for a favor"?

801
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:05,881
Do you really think Shao'an
went to see Ms. Lyu that day?

802
00:39:06,562 --> 00:39:08,642
Did he purposely tell me that?

803
00:39:08,874 --> 00:39:10,074
But why would he do that?

804
00:39:11,602 --> 00:39:12,841
I'm not sure.

805
00:39:13,241 --> 00:39:14,911
But the person in Jimo House

806
00:39:14,936 --> 00:39:16,055
isn't an enemy.

807
00:39:17,042 --> 00:39:19,042
From now on,
I will treat him as my brother.

808
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,693
(Luo's Residence)

809
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:27,810
(Haitang Abode)

810
00:39:36,162 --> 00:39:36,681
Young Master,

811
00:39:36,848 --> 00:39:38,944
I found the late Emperor's handwriting
on this painting.

812
00:39:38,976 --> 00:39:40,208
Will it be here?

813
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,360
If you were Old Master,

814
00:39:44,201 --> 00:39:46,562
would you put it here

815
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:48,810
when everyone knew you were good
at painting trees

816
00:39:49,024 --> 00:39:51,376
and the late Emperor even left
his inscriptions on them?

817
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:52,482
You have a point.

818
00:39:56,241 --> 00:39:58,162
Are you sure Seventh Lady
won't come back now?

819
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,521
She always serves
at Ximu Hall at this hour

820
00:40:00,681 --> 00:40:02,562
until the Xu hour.

821
00:40:02,681 --> 00:40:04,881
Just in case, let's make it quick.

822
00:40:04,912 --> 00:40:05,760
Yes, Young Master.

823
00:40:09,927 --> 00:40:11,728
You must be tired, Young Lady.

824
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,190
Didn't you say she should be serving
in Ximu Hall now?

825
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:18,002
This is unexpected. What should we do?

826
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:19,800
Young Lady,

827
00:40:19,856 --> 00:40:21,250
Old Madam is concerned about you,

828
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,280
that's why she didn't let you serve her.

829
00:40:23,610 --> 00:40:25,130
It has been tough for you these days.

830
00:40:25,155 --> 00:40:26,396
Please rest early.

831
00:40:26,962 --> 00:40:28,002
I wonder

832
00:40:28,562 --> 00:40:30,162
if they have found Physician Du.

833
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:32,562
Second Master and Madam Lin
should be working on it.

834
00:40:33,082 --> 00:40:34,962
Hopefully, they can find him soon

835
00:40:35,361 --> 00:40:36,721
and heal Grandma.

836
00:40:37,881 --> 00:40:38,562
Well,

837
00:40:38,881 --> 00:40:40,761
let's go to Mother's abode tonight.

838
00:40:40,802 --> 00:40:43,201
Tell the kitchen
to send almond soup over.

839
00:40:44,096 --> 00:40:44,760
Yes, Young Lady.

840
00:40:51,042 --> 00:40:53,122
They mentioned Physician Du just now.

841
00:40:53,536 --> 00:40:54,760
Send someone to look into it.

842
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:55,769
Yes, Young Master.

843
00:40:57,642 --> 00:40:58,361
Let's continue.

844
00:40:59,344 --> 00:41:00,770
(Bilian Pavilion)
Let me out!

845
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,482
- I can't stay here anymore.
- No.

846
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,898
It's late at night.
Also, you are under house arrest.

847
00:41:04,923 --> 00:41:06,003
You can't leave the room.

848
00:41:06,681 --> 00:41:08,663
I want to see Father.

849
00:41:08,688 --> 00:41:10,009
He hasn't come here

850
00:41:10,131 --> 00:41:12,082
ever since I was grounded.

851
00:41:12,106 --> 00:41:14,305
This has never happened before.

852
00:41:14,484 --> 00:41:15,162
Young Lady,

853
00:41:15,273 --> 00:41:16,914
Mistress Qiao told us

854
00:41:17,082 --> 00:41:19,642
to endure even more
during a time like this.

855
00:41:19,922 --> 00:41:22,162
She can endure, but I definitely can't!

856
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,559
Young Lady, you are
no match for Luo Yining.

857
00:41:24,592 --> 00:41:25,910
If she finds leverage against you...

858
00:41:25,962 --> 00:41:27,721
How can I be no match for her?

859
00:41:27,841 --> 00:41:29,002
Father has always doted on me

860
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,560
and treated me as a legitimate daughter.

861
00:41:30,576 --> 00:41:31,160
Also,

862
00:41:31,401 --> 00:41:33,122
my brother, Xuan, has bright prospects.

863
00:41:33,321 --> 00:41:35,761
Father has placed all his hope on him.

864
00:41:36,082 --> 00:41:37,241
What does Luo Yining have?

865
00:41:37,322 --> 00:41:39,050
Aside from the sickly Grandma,

866
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:40,560
does she have anything better than me?

867
00:41:40,801 --> 00:41:42,281
Young Lady, keep it down.

868
00:41:42,306 --> 00:41:44,396
If this gets out,

869
00:41:45,922 --> 00:41:47,281
you will be deemed disrespectful.

870
00:41:48,602 --> 00:41:49,721
Yes, you are right.

871
00:41:49,895 --> 00:41:51,089
You are far better

872
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:52,841
than her in every way.

873
00:41:53,186 --> 00:41:54,266
It's just that

874
00:41:54,341 --> 00:41:57,060
Mistress Qiao doesn't want you
to be bothered by her.

875
00:41:58,321 --> 00:42:00,321
Mother has overestimated Luo Yining.

876
00:42:00,496 --> 00:42:01,920
The more you all think highly of her,

877
00:42:02,016 --> 00:42:03,712
the more I want to
take her down a notch.

878
00:42:05,681 --> 00:42:06,442
Young Lady.

879
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,319
Spread this

880
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,200
around the Haitang Abode.

881
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,520
What's this?

882
00:42:28,122 --> 00:42:29,801
Don't smell it.

883
00:42:30,241 --> 00:42:31,361
Don't act clumsily.

884
00:42:31,841 --> 00:42:32,522
Also,

885
00:42:32,898 --> 00:42:33,777
don't let my mother

886
00:42:34,082 --> 00:42:35,642
find out about this.

887
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,080
Mother.

888
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:39,799
You are here, Yining.

889
00:42:40,681 --> 00:42:42,839
I heard you were still busy
at this hour,

890
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,000
so I brought you some almond soup.

891
00:42:46,962 --> 00:42:48,442
Daughters are sweethearts.

892
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:51,334
I didn't know
I would have such fortune now.

893
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,881
I can't understand
how Mistress Qiao managed

894
00:42:54,906 --> 00:42:56,185
the accounts all these years.

895
00:42:56,546 --> 00:42:58,185
If any of my shopkeepers

896
00:42:58,562 --> 00:42:59,801
made accounts like this,

897
00:43:00,017 --> 00:43:01,577
I would've kicked them out.

898
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:04,160
Mother, did you handle accounts before?

899
00:43:04,642 --> 00:43:06,774
I used to help my father

900
00:43:06,816 --> 00:43:08,416
manage a dozen shops
before I got married.

901
00:43:08,468 --> 00:43:09,388
When I was a kid,

902
00:43:09,642 --> 00:43:11,162
every time I read or wrote,

903
00:43:11,403 --> 00:43:12,483
my head would hurt.

904
00:43:13,281 --> 00:43:15,281
But I was elated

905
00:43:15,721 --> 00:43:17,082
to use the abacus and do accounts.

906
00:43:19,721 --> 00:43:22,602
Are you going to finish
all those ledgers tonight?

907
00:43:22,749 --> 00:43:23,835
They are only part of it.

908
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:26,602
Butler Bai said there was
another chest of ledgers outside.

909
00:43:27,042 --> 00:43:29,361
Mistress Qiao has been
managing the household for years.

910
00:43:29,392 --> 00:43:32,150
It's impossible to finish crunching
all the numbers in just a few days.

911
00:43:34,122 --> 00:43:36,442
How about you teach me?

912
00:43:37,002 --> 00:43:38,562
Perhaps

913
00:43:38,587 --> 00:43:40,186
I can help ease your burden.

914
00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:42,209
You are intelligent.

915
00:43:42,633 --> 00:43:43,914
You will pick it up quickly.

916
00:43:44,642 --> 00:43:47,562
Also, I need a helper.
