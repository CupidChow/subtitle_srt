(Adapted from Wen Tan's novel "Chancellor
Training Handbook" from Jinjiang Literature)

3
00:01:36,588 --> 00:01:38,931
=Episode 34=

4
00:02:02,338 --> 00:02:04,338
Is that Marquis Lu?

5
00:02:06,499 --> 00:02:07,698
Did you invite him?

6
00:02:08,138 --> 00:02:09,018
No.

7
00:02:10,064 --> 00:02:12,170
What a great prestige
for Duke Ying's Residence.

8
00:02:12,224 --> 00:02:14,330
Marquis Lu actually came
to attend the Flowers Festival.

9
00:02:15,059 --> 00:02:16,738
But why did Marquis Lu

10
00:02:16,738 --> 00:02:18,018
come to the garden?

11
00:02:18,059 --> 00:02:20,379
Obviously, His Lordship came
to deliver a decree.

12
00:02:20,738 --> 00:02:22,818
Didn't you see the two palace servants
following him?

13
00:02:28,219 --> 00:02:29,939
Old Madam, the guest is here.

14
00:02:38,418 --> 00:02:39,578
Greetings, Old Madams.

15
00:02:44,435 --> 00:02:45,231
Old Madam Wei,

16
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:47,632
everyone admires the famous flowers
during the Flowers Festival.

17
00:02:47,664 --> 00:02:49,850
The Empress has gifted you
this Bingdi Lotus

18
00:02:49,858 --> 00:02:51,899
as the grand prize
for the Flowers Festival.

19
00:02:53,059 --> 00:02:54,939
Thank Her Majesty.

20
00:02:58,578 --> 00:03:00,939
Why's there lotus in this season?

21
00:03:00,978 --> 00:03:02,138
Is that a dried flower?

22
00:03:04,339 --> 00:03:06,179
There are flower caretakers
in the palace

23
00:03:06,219 --> 00:03:07,698
who study flower-forcing techniques,

24
00:03:07,858 --> 00:03:09,298
using water at different temperatures

25
00:03:09,298 --> 00:03:10,939
to tend to flowers outside their season.

26
00:03:10,939 --> 00:03:13,779
Grandma and I saw this
when we entered the palace.

27
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,970
They are rare and precious.

28
00:03:15,018 --> 00:03:17,059
Duke Ying's Residence must be proud.

29
00:03:17,059 --> 00:03:18,779
Even Her Majesty sent the prize over.

30
00:03:18,818 --> 00:03:21,698
I didn't expect you
to come here, Marquis Lu.

31
00:03:21,939 --> 00:03:23,099
Today is the Flowers Festival.

32
00:03:23,499 --> 00:03:24,379
I entered the palace

33
00:03:24,418 --> 00:03:26,298
to present flowers to Her Majesty.

34
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,250
After learning
that this year's Flowers Festival

35
00:03:28,258 --> 00:03:29,779
is hosted by Duke Ying's Residence

36
00:03:29,808 --> 00:03:31,050
and that it's the first appearance

37
00:03:31,059 --> 00:03:32,738
of County Princess of Qingcheng,

38
00:03:32,944 --> 00:03:34,470
Her Majesty specifically
instructed me

39
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:35,999
to deliver the grand prize.

40
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,559
You're thoughtful, Marquis Lu.

41
00:03:38,559 --> 00:03:39,679
In that case,

42
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,599
please do away

43
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,279
with the formalities.

44
00:03:43,679 --> 00:03:45,760
Show all the male guests
in the front yard

45
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,360
to the main garden

46
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,960
to try their luck

47
00:03:48,999 --> 00:03:50,960
for the grand prize.

48
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,679
Yes, Old Madam Wei.

49
00:03:54,119 --> 00:03:55,599
Ladies, please come this way.

50
00:04:07,399 --> 00:04:09,599
Ladies and gentlemen,

51
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:12,040
whoever retrieves the Bingdi Lotus

52
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:14,599
will claim the grand prize.

53
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,359
If we can get

54
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:18,760
this Bingdi Lotus in our store,

55
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,799
Yanrong Pavilion will definitely
become famous.

56
00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:23,839
Do you want it?

57
00:04:30,239 --> 00:04:31,039
Yu,

58
00:04:31,159 --> 00:04:32,200
I want the grand prize.

59
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,200
Please help me.

60
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:34,200
Don't worry.

61
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,880
It's a piece of cake.

62
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,279
Forget about

63
00:04:50,599 --> 00:04:51,599
the grand prize.

64
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,960
I didn't know Shenyuan could shoot.

65
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,960
When did Third Brother learn that?

66
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,960
He knows a lot.

67
00:06:05,936 --> 00:06:08,100
You were trying so hard to hide
your martial arts skills

68
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,000
that you got injured that day.

69
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,789
But you're not hiding it today.

70
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,360
Thank you for your compliment,
Marquis Lu.

71
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,640
I only practice some moves

72
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,479
that help strengthen my body.

73
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,200
I want to get it for Young Lady Wei

74
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,680
to celebrate her title.

75
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:28,839
I wonder

76
00:07:28,896 --> 00:07:30,576
if you have the same intention as I do.

77
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,159
That's what I thought.

78
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,680
Very well.

79
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,760
Why don't we use this grand prize

80
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,960
to present it to Young Lady Wei

81
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,080
together?

82
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:45,279
How does that sound?

83
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,640
That's good.

84
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,000
You got it, Yining.

85
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,239
Let me see.

86
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,799
Imperial Scholar Luo always seems

87
00:08:23,799 --> 00:08:25,000
to be gentle.

88
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:25,960
I didn't know

89
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:28,279
his skills were on par with Marquis Lu's.

90
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,800
Do Minister Luo and Marquis Lu...

91
00:08:33,359 --> 00:08:35,359
Isn't that obvious enough?

92
00:08:35,999 --> 00:08:38,040
Young Lady Wei is really something.

93
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:01,839
You've got most of the attention today.

94
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,440
Today's the Flowers Festival,
and you're the host family.

95
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,160
Plus, two men competed
for the grand prize for you.

96
00:09:07,359 --> 00:09:08,160
Why?

97
00:09:08,359 --> 00:09:09,920
Marquis Lu and Third Brother

98
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,239
gave it to Yining willingly.

99
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,592
Do you have any problem with that?

100
00:09:12,592 --> 00:09:13,344
No.

101
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,759
Young Lady Wei is lucky.

102
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:18,800
Just ignore those who gossip
behind your back.

103
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,040
The feast hasn't begun yet,

104
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:21,552
but I think she's already full now.

105
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,280
Butterfly!

106
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:33,639
My father

107
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,400
intends to betroth me

108
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,639
to Third Young Master Luo.

109
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,920
I saw a butterfly flying over here,

110
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,040
so I accidentally

111
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,519
stepped on your garment.

112
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,639
It's all right.

113
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:02,639
Young Lady,

114
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,869
the seats in the garden are all set up.

115
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,392
Old Madam Wei wants you to usher
the other young ladies to the seats.

116
00:10:07,408 --> 00:10:08,688
She'll have meals with other madams

117
00:10:08,704 --> 00:10:09,936
in Jing'an Hall.

118
00:10:10,599 --> 00:10:12,960
Yining, why don't you get changed first?

119
00:11:03,328 --> 00:11:05,056
Young Ladies, please take your seat.

120
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,960
Make yourselves comfortable here.

121
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:07,999
Please have some pastries.

122
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,360
This liquor is nice.

123
00:11:12,479 --> 00:11:13,839
This pastry is delicious.

124
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:19,440
All right.

125
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,560
You may go.

126
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:22,320
- Yes.
- Yes.

127
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,680
Yixiu, do you think it's tasty or not?

128
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:49,040
It's tasty, of course.

129
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,239
Come on, Yining.

130
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:51,440
Come here.

131
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,120
This is really delicious.

132
00:11:53,184 --> 00:11:54,256
Come. Have a seat.

133
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,200
Can you tell me

134
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,869
what ingredient did you use?

135
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,560
It tastes different
from those sold outside.

136
00:11:58,608 --> 00:11:59,184
Tell me, please.

137
00:11:59,216 --> 00:12:00,790
I'll have my chef make this later.

138
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,440
We added chestnuts.

139
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,040
No wonder.

140
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,080
The flavor is very different
from those outside.

141
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,160
It's really nice.

142
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,080
You can't stop eating it, right?

143
00:12:11,552 --> 00:12:13,200
- What's wrong with my hand?
- Look at it.

144
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,479
- It's so itchy.
- Me too.

145
00:12:14,479 --> 00:12:15,160
What's going on?

146
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:16,759
There's something on your neck.

147
00:12:17,232 --> 00:12:18,230
Why is this happening?

148
00:12:18,239 --> 00:12:19,400
Why are my hands so itchy?

149
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,560
Me too.

150
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,888
My neck is also itchy.

151
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,830
It's all red.

152
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:25,960
What is this?

153
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:26,879
It's so itchy.

154
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,200
Why am I starting to itch?

155
00:12:31,472 --> 00:12:32,590
Why is there redness there?

156
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,239
I don't know. So itchy.

157
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,599
Stop scratching.

158
00:12:35,599 --> 00:12:36,639
It'll be worse.

159
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,759
Don't you feel itchy?

160
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:40,479
I...

161
00:12:42,359 --> 00:12:43,920
I think I'm fine.

162
00:12:44,719 --> 00:12:46,280
Why is everyone starting to itch?

163
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,639
My hands are so itchy.

164
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:50,599
Me too.

165
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,239
Look at here.

166
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,400
What should I do?

167
00:12:59,160 --> 00:12:59,960
Physician,

168
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,440
are they all right?

169
00:13:02,839 --> 00:13:04,200
Please don't worry, Old Madam Wei.

170
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,920
It's the rash

171
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,599
that caused the redness and itching.

172
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,160
They'll be fine after a rest.

173
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,599
Remember to remind them

174
00:13:10,599 --> 00:13:11,839
not to scratch too hard.

175
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,040
It might leave scars.

176
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:16,639
Physician,

177
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,160
do you know

178
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,839
what triggers this?

179
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,160
It's hard to say.

180
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,999
The young ladies are
all staying outdoors,

181
00:13:23,999 --> 00:13:25,280
and there are many plants.

182
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,839
It's very likely to be in contact

183
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:28,400
with things that trigger itching.

184
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,440
How is that possible?

185
00:13:29,488 --> 00:13:31,504
It's not our first time
attending the Flowers Festival.

186
00:13:31,568 --> 00:13:32,432
This has never happened

187
00:13:32,544 --> 00:13:33,680
in the past.

188
00:13:33,696 --> 00:13:34,680
- That's right.
- Exactly.

189
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:35,600
It never happened before.

190
00:13:35,696 --> 00:13:36,464
That's right.

191
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:37,639
Yes.

192
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,999
Young ladies,

193
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:41,479
did you use anything

194
00:13:41,599 --> 00:13:43,280
that you've never used before?

195
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:44,879
Did we?

196
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:45,519
What?

197
00:13:46,479 --> 00:13:47,160
The floral dew.

198
00:13:49,479 --> 00:13:51,560
The only thing we didn't have before

199
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,800
was the floral dew
brought by Young Lady Wei.

200
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,759
Right. I also used that just now.

201
00:13:55,867 --> 00:13:57,308
This is impossible.
Yanrong Pavilion's

202
00:13:57,309 --> 00:13:58,909
products have no problem at all.

203
00:13:58,910 --> 00:13:59,910
Why not?

204
00:14:00,108 --> 00:14:01,588
Look at the redness and itching.

205
00:14:01,588 --> 00:14:03,069
We all used the floral dew.

206
00:14:03,104 --> 00:14:04,560
This can't be just a coincidence.

207
00:14:04,608 --> 00:14:05,820
Yanrong Pavilion?

208
00:14:05,828 --> 00:14:07,269
It's more like a disfiguring store.

209
00:14:09,488 --> 00:14:11,808
The floral dew is extracted
from fresh flowers.

210
00:14:11,824 --> 00:14:13,180
It doesn't contain other substances.

211
00:14:13,189 --> 00:14:14,909
Right. I've also tried many products

212
00:14:14,909 --> 00:14:15,828
from Yanrong Pavilion.

213
00:14:15,828 --> 00:14:16,988
There's no problem so far.

214
00:14:17,108 --> 00:14:17,909
Enough said.

215
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:20,149
You two sisters are defending it.

216
00:14:20,149 --> 00:14:22,189
Is Yanrong Pavilion yours?

217
00:14:22,468 --> 00:14:23,549
Don't talk nonsense.

218
00:14:24,948 --> 00:14:26,389
Physician, please check on this.

219
00:14:26,509 --> 00:14:27,389
This is the floral dew.

220
00:14:28,429 --> 00:14:29,628
Take out yours too.

221
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:38,748
This is hard to say.

222
00:14:39,549 --> 00:14:40,748
Natural products

223
00:14:40,988 --> 00:14:42,468
aren't always harmless to humans.

224
00:14:42,468 --> 00:14:43,269
Besides,

225
00:14:43,468 --> 00:14:46,189
this floral dew is highly concentrated.

226
00:14:48,509 --> 00:14:50,269
I brought this floral dew here.

227
00:14:50,429 --> 00:14:51,509
If something's wrong with it,

228
00:14:51,549 --> 00:14:52,948
I'll take full responsibility.

229
00:14:53,149 --> 00:14:55,069
Please give me some time.

230
00:14:55,108 --> 00:14:56,669
I'll get to the bottom of this.

231
00:15:04,468 --> 00:15:05,029
Marquis Lu,

232
00:15:05,328 --> 00:15:06,340
let me offer you a toast.

233
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,872
This bunch of snobs.

234
00:15:07,936 --> 00:15:10,270
They're lining up to offer toasts
once Marquis Lu has arrived.

235
00:15:10,828 --> 00:15:11,628
That's pretty good.

236
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:12,800
It's quiet now.

237
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:14,108
Come. Let's drink to Marquis Lu.

238
00:15:14,628 --> 00:15:15,429
Young Master,

239
00:15:15,669 --> 00:15:16,669
I noticed

240
00:15:16,669 --> 00:15:18,429
a physician was sent
to the garden just now.

241
00:15:18,429 --> 00:15:19,619
I went to ask around.

242
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,120
They said the ladies in the garden

243
00:15:21,184 --> 00:15:22,260
suddenly broke out in rashes.

244
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:24,389
Is Yining all right?

245
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:25,628
This is weird.

246
00:15:25,628 --> 00:15:27,108
Only the Seventh Lady is fine.

247
00:15:27,108 --> 00:15:28,149
I'll go and check on Yixiu.

248
00:15:28,189 --> 00:15:30,108
Uncle, there are all ladies
over there.

249
00:15:30,108 --> 00:15:31,228
It's not appropriate if you

250
00:15:31,228 --> 00:15:32,108
suddenly show up there.

251
00:15:32,309 --> 00:15:34,348
Sixth Master Lin, since they've sent
for a physician,

252
00:15:34,429 --> 00:15:35,669
it should be no problem.

253
00:15:36,429 --> 00:15:38,549
I don't think the physician
can do better than me.

254
00:15:38,828 --> 00:15:40,708
Send Qing Qu to bring Yining out.

255
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:41,189
Yes.

256
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:55,628
Third Brother.

257
00:16:11,408 --> 00:16:12,500
It's good that you're fine.

258
00:16:13,309 --> 00:16:14,309
I'm all good.

259
00:16:15,868 --> 00:16:16,948
I'm relieved, then.

260
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:19,748
You know what happened in the garden?

261
00:16:19,748 --> 00:16:21,868
I think they're after you.

262
00:16:22,828 --> 00:16:23,948
That's what I thought.

263
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:25,348
Try to recall

264
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,100
if you did anything
different from others

265
00:16:27,108 --> 00:16:29,389
before the incident happened.

266
00:16:37,549 --> 00:16:38,309
Is there any?

267
00:16:38,669 --> 00:16:40,189
One thing does come up to me.

268
00:16:40,748 --> 00:16:41,348
Qing Qu,

269
00:16:42,108 --> 00:16:43,228
go and investigate.

270
00:16:44,429 --> 00:16:44,948
Yes.

271
00:16:48,988 --> 00:16:49,868
Hey.

272
00:16:50,269 --> 00:16:51,069
Yes?

273
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,680
Young Lady Wei wants to wash her hands.

274
00:16:52,688 --> 00:16:53,840
I need to prepare it for her.

275
00:16:54,069 --> 00:16:55,149
Please come with me.

276
00:17:07,108 --> 00:17:08,269
Are there any cloths?

277
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,269
All are used.

278
00:17:11,188 --> 00:17:12,269
Laundry Division

279
00:17:12,269 --> 00:17:13,789
hasn't delivered the clean ones yet.

280
00:17:14,029 --> 00:17:15,428
Have all the basins and cloths been

281
00:17:15,428 --> 00:17:17,309
delivered from the Laundry Division
after cleaning?

282
00:17:17,309 --> 00:17:18,188
Yes.

283
00:17:18,668 --> 00:17:20,269
What should I do?

284
00:17:22,428 --> 00:17:23,108
It's all right.

285
00:17:23,108 --> 00:17:25,269
I'll find another cloth for Young Lady.

286
00:17:25,868 --> 00:17:27,309
Thank you.

287
00:17:51,469 --> 00:17:52,989
Where has Young Lady Wei gone?

288
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,520
Has she investigated anything yet?

289
00:17:54,628 --> 00:17:56,309
She should at least send someone
to explain.

290
00:17:56,549 --> 00:17:57,668
What's there to investigate?

291
00:17:58,388 --> 00:17:59,619
I'm sure that something's wrong

292
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,376
with the floral dew
from Yanrong Pavilion.

293
00:18:02,108 --> 00:18:03,469
Young Lady Wei actually brought us

294
00:18:03,469 --> 00:18:05,269
something from an unknown source for us.

295
00:18:05,309 --> 00:18:06,668
What exactly is she up to?

296
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:08,348
Tell me about it.

297
00:18:08,348 --> 00:18:10,309
Nothing is clear yet.
Don't talk nonsense.

298
00:18:11,949 --> 00:18:13,749
Mother, I'm not wrong.

299
00:18:13,789 --> 00:18:14,428
That little store

300
00:18:14,428 --> 00:18:15,509
is indecent,

301
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,232
and their products
aren't up to par either.

302
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,269
I understand

303
00:18:25,509 --> 00:18:27,269
all of you

304
00:18:27,269 --> 00:18:28,469
have concerns.

305
00:18:28,789 --> 00:18:29,989
But if this is really done

306
00:18:29,989 --> 00:18:31,509
by the Wei Family,

307
00:18:31,789 --> 00:18:33,668
I'll give you an explanation.

308
00:18:33,668 --> 00:18:35,029
However, if it's not

309
00:18:35,188 --> 00:18:36,309
and someone slanders us,

310
00:18:37,069 --> 00:18:38,949
I won't spare them.

311
00:18:57,509 --> 00:18:58,309
Hold on.

312
00:18:59,789 --> 00:19:01,229
It's you, Qing Qu.

313
00:19:01,549 --> 00:19:02,908
Are these the cloths

314
00:19:02,949 --> 00:19:04,828
the young ladies used at the feast?

315
00:19:04,828 --> 00:19:06,148
Yes. Why?

316
00:19:06,368 --> 00:19:08,170
My young lady might drop
her accessory into this

317
00:19:08,176 --> 00:19:09,260
while washing her hands.

318
00:19:09,269 --> 00:19:10,108
Let me see.

319
00:19:10,188 --> 00:19:11,309
It'd be hard to find it

320
00:19:11,309 --> 00:19:12,509
if it dropped in the water.

321
00:19:12,908 --> 00:19:14,069
You should try searching for it.

322
00:19:14,188 --> 00:19:16,309
Young Lady Wei's things are valuable.

323
00:19:16,469 --> 00:19:17,469
I can't afford it

324
00:19:17,469 --> 00:19:18,428
if it's lost.

325
00:19:18,428 --> 00:19:19,899
Not at all. It's not worth much.

326
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,888
It's just that my young lady
cherishes it very much.

327
00:19:35,989 --> 00:19:37,029
You are in charge

328
00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:38,509
of these cloths?

329
00:19:38,749 --> 00:19:39,549
That's right.

330
00:19:39,549 --> 00:19:41,229
I'm the maid in charge of the laundry.

331
00:19:41,269 --> 00:19:43,309
We wash the used cloths.

332
00:19:43,989 --> 00:19:45,709
Who delivers them to the feast?

333
00:19:45,789 --> 00:19:48,069
The maids who serve at the feast.

334
00:19:48,309 --> 00:19:50,069
Did six maids

335
00:19:50,069 --> 00:19:51,668
- go to collect them just now?
- No.

336
00:19:51,749 --> 00:19:53,549
It was Young Lady Zhao's maid.

337
00:19:53,588 --> 00:19:54,789
There were not enough attendants,

338
00:19:54,789 --> 00:19:55,668
so she offered help.

339
00:20:04,029 --> 00:20:04,628
Young Lady,

340
00:20:04,832 --> 00:20:05,808
this is what it is.

341
00:20:11,989 --> 00:20:13,069
Do you need my help?

342
00:20:13,749 --> 00:20:16,428
If I were to pursue this incident,

343
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:18,229
it would embarrass Grandma

344
00:20:18,428 --> 00:20:21,029
as well as the Wei Family.

345
00:20:21,908 --> 00:20:24,309
I didn't expect you to value
the Wei Family so highly.

346
00:20:25,509 --> 00:20:26,949
I didn't expect that either.

347
00:20:27,868 --> 00:20:29,309
It seems they have treated you well.

348
00:20:29,509 --> 00:20:31,509
Father is very kind to me.

349
00:20:32,069 --> 00:20:33,908
Grandma may be strict,

350
00:20:33,908 --> 00:20:36,029
but she also cares for me sincerely.

351
00:20:36,029 --> 00:20:37,428
I don't want to disappoint them.

352
00:20:37,789 --> 00:20:39,709
All right. Point taken.

353
00:20:41,148 --> 00:20:43,668
I'll handle this myself.

354
00:20:43,949 --> 00:20:44,908
You'll return first.

355
00:20:58,509 --> 00:21:00,029
I'm sorry

356
00:21:00,029 --> 00:21:01,269
for letting you worry, Grandmas.

357
00:21:02,549 --> 00:21:03,469
Yining,

358
00:21:03,628 --> 00:21:04,908
what have you found?

359
00:21:06,269 --> 00:21:07,828
Young ladies, do you remember

360
00:21:07,828 --> 00:21:09,029
what you all did together

361
00:21:09,269 --> 00:21:10,868
before the itching started?

362
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:15,229
We were drinking floral liquor

363
00:21:15,229 --> 00:21:16,428
and floral pastries together.

364
00:21:16,549 --> 00:21:17,828
What about before that?

365
00:21:17,908 --> 00:21:19,069
Before that,

366
00:21:20,148 --> 00:21:21,069
we washed our hands.

367
00:21:21,088 --> 00:21:23,200
Shortly after that,
my hands started feeling itchy.

368
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,420
You didn't wash your hands.

369
00:21:24,428 --> 00:21:25,309
Those maids left

370
00:21:25,309 --> 00:21:26,709
when you arrived, right?

371
00:21:27,188 --> 00:21:28,709
Young ladies, do you remember

372
00:21:28,719 --> 00:21:31,038
if your palms started itching,
and then you

373
00:21:31,269 --> 00:21:32,269
touched your neck

374
00:21:32,269 --> 00:21:34,108
and cheeks with your palms,

375
00:21:34,188 --> 00:21:35,309
which then

376
00:21:35,309 --> 00:21:36,348
started to itch as well?

377
00:21:36,828 --> 00:21:38,269
Exactly.

378
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:39,628
I think so.

379
00:21:39,982 --> 00:21:40,982
That's right.

380
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,032
It started to feel itchy

381
00:21:42,064 --> 00:21:43,120
wherever my hands touched.

382
00:21:45,029 --> 00:21:45,828
Qing Qu.

383
00:21:48,628 --> 00:21:49,709
These are the cloths

384
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:51,030
we used earlier, right?

385
00:21:51,509 --> 00:21:52,309
Physician,

386
00:21:52,348 --> 00:21:53,668
could you please take a look

387
00:21:53,828 --> 00:21:56,148
and see if there's anything on it?

388
00:22:04,188 --> 00:22:07,029
This cloth is stained with yam sap.

389
00:22:07,828 --> 00:22:09,828
Yam sap?

390
00:22:10,828 --> 00:22:12,309
Right, it's yam.

391
00:22:12,348 --> 00:22:13,828
What's wrong with yam?

392
00:22:14,148 --> 00:22:16,148
It's often cooked in soups.

393
00:22:16,428 --> 00:22:17,908
I've never seen symptoms like this.

394
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:19,109
Eating cooked yam

395
00:22:19,388 --> 00:22:20,949
is fine,

396
00:22:21,148 --> 00:22:23,348
but the sap on its skin

397
00:22:23,428 --> 00:22:26,069
can trigger redness and itching.

398
00:22:27,549 --> 00:22:29,828
If you still have doubts,

399
00:22:29,828 --> 00:22:30,949
there's another method.

400
00:22:31,188 --> 00:22:31,908
Qing Qu,

401
00:22:31,908 --> 00:22:33,828
bring hot water and salt here.

402
00:22:39,408 --> 00:22:41,460
Don't apply the salt water directly
to your face.

403
00:22:41,668 --> 00:22:44,069
You can apply heat with the towel.

404
00:22:44,309 --> 00:22:45,828
The hotter the water, the better.

405
00:22:48,388 --> 00:22:50,188
The itching is gone. What about you?

406
00:22:50,188 --> 00:22:50,749
Right.

407
00:22:50,749 --> 00:22:51,628
Old Madam Luo.

408
00:22:51,949 --> 00:22:52,789
It's not itchy anymore.

409
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:53,628
I wonder

410
00:22:54,668 --> 00:22:56,108
why there's yam sap

411
00:22:56,348 --> 00:22:58,428
on these cloths?

412
00:22:59,309 --> 00:23:00,549
I don't know either.

413
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:05,148
Today's Flowers Festival

414
00:23:05,348 --> 00:23:07,188
is held by the Wei's Residence.

415
00:23:07,549 --> 00:23:10,348
While it didn't cause serious harm,

416
00:23:10,348 --> 00:23:13,549
this was clearly someone's doing.

417
00:23:14,309 --> 00:23:15,908
Duke Ying's Residence

418
00:23:16,124 --> 00:23:17,604
will investigate this thoroughly

419
00:23:17,637 --> 00:23:19,877
and give everyone an explanation.

420
00:23:20,938 --> 00:23:24,226
♪To break the chain of nights♪

421
00:23:25,868 --> 00:23:27,749
Ning, tell me.

422
00:23:28,309 --> 00:23:30,069
Did you find out

423
00:23:30,348 --> 00:23:31,749
who did that long ago?

424
00:23:33,188 --> 00:23:33,989
Grandma,

425
00:23:34,908 --> 00:23:36,348
I've been through

426
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:37,908
some ups and downs.

427
00:23:38,309 --> 00:23:40,428
This is only trivial.

428
00:23:40,428 --> 00:23:41,469
Well.

429
00:23:42,229 --> 00:23:43,628
I should get going.

430
00:23:47,428 --> 00:23:48,509
Take good care of Grandma.

431
00:23:48,509 --> 00:23:49,269
I'm leaving.

432
00:23:52,588 --> 00:23:53,989
Send Qing Qu or Xue Zhi to inform me

433
00:23:53,989 --> 00:23:54,939
if anything happens.

434
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,720
I'll come to give you lectures
a few days later.

435
00:23:56,908 --> 00:23:58,388
Just take good care of yourself.

436
00:23:58,749 --> 00:23:59,549
What's wrong with me?

437
00:24:10,789 --> 00:24:11,949
Thank you for coming uninvited,

438
00:24:11,949 --> 00:24:13,148
Marquis Lu.

439
00:24:14,749 --> 00:24:16,749
Did something happen in the garden
just now?

440
00:24:17,668 --> 00:24:19,469
This is our own business.

441
00:24:19,828 --> 00:24:21,388
I don't want to trouble you with that.

442
00:24:22,229 --> 00:24:24,069
There's one thing
I'd like to ask of you.

443
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:25,348
No matter what favor it is,

444
00:24:25,628 --> 00:24:26,509
I'll say yes.

445
00:24:26,828 --> 00:24:28,029
Did you request

446
00:24:28,029 --> 00:24:30,269
for the grand prize earlier today?

447
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,384
This is your first appearance

448
00:24:34,432 --> 00:24:36,020
on an important occasion

449
00:24:36,029 --> 00:24:37,269
as the daughter of Duke Ying.

450
00:24:37,668 --> 00:24:39,108
It certainly needs to be decent.

451
00:24:39,668 --> 00:24:40,709
Marquis Lu,

452
00:24:40,828 --> 00:24:42,428
please don't do that again.

453
00:24:42,628 --> 00:24:43,668
As long as you like it,

454
00:24:44,069 --> 00:24:45,309
I will do anything for you.

455
00:24:47,549 --> 00:24:48,509
In that case, Marquis Lu,

456
00:24:49,069 --> 00:24:49,868
please leave.

457
00:25:00,469 --> 00:25:01,469
Mingzhu.

458
00:25:05,229 --> 00:25:07,309
Did you hurt yourself by scratching
earlier today?

459
00:25:08,108 --> 00:25:08,908
No.

460
00:25:09,712 --> 00:25:11,328
Thank you for your concern, Yining.

461
00:25:17,469 --> 00:25:18,309
Ting,

462
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,700
you just returned from the academy?

463
00:25:21,069 --> 00:25:21,828
I heard

464
00:25:21,828 --> 00:25:23,469
you got the grand prize just now.

465
00:25:23,588 --> 00:25:24,789
May I borrow it?

466
00:25:25,229 --> 00:25:27,269
The Bingdi Lotus
isn't quite interesting.

467
00:25:27,269 --> 00:25:29,269
If I come across something fun tomorrow,

468
00:25:29,269 --> 00:25:30,348
I'll buy it for you.

469
00:25:33,309 --> 00:25:34,469
Why are you unhappy?

470
00:25:35,029 --> 00:25:36,828
I noticed one of the guests

471
00:25:36,908 --> 00:25:38,668
brought a dagger as a gift.

472
00:25:38,908 --> 00:25:40,188
I thought you would like it,

473
00:25:40,188 --> 00:25:41,668
so I brought it to you.

474
00:25:41,668 --> 00:25:42,428
Really?

475
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,032
Suxi, give it to him.

476
00:25:46,668 --> 00:25:47,989
Do you like it?

477
00:25:55,269 --> 00:25:56,509
I'm sorry, Suxi.

478
00:25:56,628 --> 00:25:57,789
I'm panicking.

479
00:25:57,908 --> 00:25:58,908
Ting is in a rash again.

480
00:25:58,908 --> 00:26:00,229
I need to inform Young Lady.

481
00:26:00,229 --> 00:26:01,069
I'm sorry.

482
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:18,309
What?

483
00:26:18,388 --> 00:26:19,348
He gets a rash?

484
00:26:20,868 --> 00:26:23,029
Ting only gets a rash
when he touches yams.

485
00:26:24,029 --> 00:26:24,908
Have you cleaned up

486
00:26:25,069 --> 00:26:26,309
everything in our place?

487
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:27,949
Yes.

488
00:26:27,949 --> 00:26:29,029
Those bottles that carry yams

489
00:26:29,029 --> 00:26:30,229
were all thrown away.

490
00:26:30,256 --> 00:26:31,180
I also washed my hands

491
00:26:31,188 --> 00:26:32,428
when I returned.

492
00:26:33,868 --> 00:26:34,348
And...

493
00:26:35,148 --> 00:26:35,749
And...

494
00:26:36,709 --> 00:26:38,668
The dagger. What about the dagger?

495
00:26:39,188 --> 00:26:40,108
Did you clean it

496
00:26:40,186 --> 00:26:41,347
before sending it over?

497
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:44,469
You know Ting gets rashes
once he touches yams.

498
00:26:44,469 --> 00:26:45,469
It's my fault.

499
00:26:46,428 --> 00:26:48,388
What if something bad happened to Ting?

500
00:26:50,148 --> 00:26:51,749
I shouldn't have done that.

501
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,240
Even Ting got involved.

502
00:26:58,749 --> 00:26:59,668
Mingzhu,

503
00:27:00,908 --> 00:27:02,868
where are you going at this hour?

504
00:27:03,664 --> 00:27:05,300
I was told
that Ting breaks out in rashes.

505
00:27:05,309 --> 00:27:06,188
I'll check on him.

506
00:27:06,309 --> 00:27:07,388
Ting is all right.

507
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:08,789
This is a misunderstanding.

508
00:27:10,029 --> 00:27:11,428
Grandma always dotes on him.

509
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,780
Even if this is a misunderstanding,

510
00:27:12,784 --> 00:27:13,980
she'll be worried sick.

511
00:27:14,064 --> 00:27:15,340
I need to go and visit Grandma.

512
00:27:16,309 --> 00:27:18,509
Grandma and Ting are fine.

513
00:27:19,269 --> 00:27:20,549
However, I have something

514
00:27:20,908 --> 00:27:22,269
to talk to you.

515
00:27:28,509 --> 00:27:29,908
Seeing how caring you are

516
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:31,668
for Grandma

517
00:27:31,949 --> 00:27:33,069
and Ting,

518
00:27:33,509 --> 00:27:35,069
I'm truly glad.

519
00:27:36,348 --> 00:27:37,509
That reminds me

520
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:39,509
of my days in the Luo's Residence,

521
00:27:43,029 --> 00:27:43,828
even though

522
00:27:44,309 --> 00:27:45,428
I'm not

523
00:27:45,828 --> 00:27:47,309
part of the family.

524
00:27:49,564 --> 00:27:50,364
Yining,

525
00:27:50,949 --> 00:27:53,269
what are you getting at?

526
00:27:54,348 --> 00:27:55,509
I used to think

527
00:27:55,668 --> 00:27:58,428
that they would treat me less friendly
after knowing

528
00:27:58,509 --> 00:27:59,908
that we had no blood relation.

529
00:28:01,029 --> 00:28:02,509
To my surprise,

530
00:28:03,069 --> 00:28:05,428
they treat me like their own family

531
00:28:05,668 --> 00:28:07,108
as they always have.

532
00:28:09,709 --> 00:28:10,949
Only then did I realize

533
00:28:12,069 --> 00:28:14,108
that the relationships between people

534
00:28:14,749 --> 00:28:16,989
don't rely solely on blood relations.

535
00:28:17,949 --> 00:28:20,668
Sincerity is what matters.

536
00:28:22,628 --> 00:28:23,428
True.

537
00:28:24,668 --> 00:28:26,989
Sincerity is precious.

538
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,056
The identity of being
the legitimate daughter of a Duke

539
00:28:31,388 --> 00:28:32,908
isn't what I want.

540
00:28:34,868 --> 00:28:35,868
To me,

541
00:28:36,148 --> 00:28:38,029
this is nothing but an identity.

542
00:28:38,908 --> 00:28:40,269
When I was in the Luo's Residence,

543
00:28:40,908 --> 00:28:42,469
I suffered a lot

544
00:28:42,949 --> 00:28:44,949
due to my birth mother.

545
00:28:45,388 --> 00:28:48,549
As for now, I only wish for an easy

546
00:28:48,908 --> 00:28:50,348
and simple life.

547
00:28:51,828 --> 00:28:54,668
Human hearts are
complicated and suspicious.

548
00:28:57,269 --> 00:28:58,749
Instead, I feel

549
00:28:59,509 --> 00:29:01,069
that one will get something

550
00:29:01,309 --> 00:29:02,749
they believe in.

551
00:29:03,668 --> 00:29:04,588
As long as

552
00:29:05,588 --> 00:29:06,388
hearts are together,

553
00:29:07,069 --> 00:29:08,029
home is there.

554
00:29:09,908 --> 00:29:10,668
Mingzhu,

555
00:29:11,376 --> 00:29:13,312
do you understand
what I'm trying to tell you?

556
00:29:33,469 --> 00:29:34,269
Yining,

557
00:29:34,908 --> 00:29:36,309
you don't have to imply that.

558
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:38,908
I know why you came here tonight.

559
00:29:40,064 --> 00:29:41,780
What happened
during the Flowers Festival

560
00:29:43,188 --> 00:29:44,148
is my doing.

561
00:29:45,428 --> 00:29:47,469
Grandma and Father want me
to accept you,

562
00:29:47,709 --> 00:29:48,868
which I'm reluctant to do,

563
00:29:48,949 --> 00:29:50,588
but I still tried.

564
00:29:51,668 --> 00:29:52,668
However, everyone

565
00:29:53,069 --> 00:29:54,388
has their selfishness.

566
00:29:54,949 --> 00:29:56,789
To be honest, I'm wary of you.

567
00:29:57,536 --> 00:29:58,980
You're the legitimate daughter,

568
00:29:59,309 --> 00:30:00,828
and I'm only an adopted daughter.

569
00:30:01,469 --> 00:30:02,628
It was a moment of weakness,

570
00:30:03,108 --> 00:30:04,789
and I did something foolish.

571
00:30:08,868 --> 00:30:09,668
I didn't know

572
00:30:09,789 --> 00:30:11,749
you were so outspoken.

573
00:30:12,628 --> 00:30:13,868
Please don't say that.

574
00:30:13,908 --> 00:30:15,949
I know I did it wrong.

575
00:30:16,428 --> 00:30:17,549
Truth be told,

576
00:30:18,069 --> 00:30:19,789
I regretted it later.

577
00:30:20,108 --> 00:30:22,029
Since you're being frank,

578
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:23,668
I won't beat around the bush.

579
00:30:24,828 --> 00:30:26,148
Honestly, to me,

580
00:30:26,549 --> 00:30:28,549
whether it's a prestigious family

581
00:30:28,628 --> 00:30:30,908
or commoners, it doesn't matter.

582
00:30:31,348 --> 00:30:33,908
I only hope that the family can
care for one another

583
00:30:33,949 --> 00:30:35,148
sincerely

584
00:30:35,908 --> 00:30:36,709
and have

585
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:38,628
a place to settle down.

586
00:30:39,108 --> 00:30:40,148
I understand now.

587
00:30:40,749 --> 00:30:41,549
Well,

588
00:30:41,749 --> 00:30:43,509
you know I did that,

589
00:30:43,709 --> 00:30:45,269
but you didn't expose me.

590
00:30:45,388 --> 00:30:46,908
I know what kind of person you are.

591
00:30:47,549 --> 00:30:48,348
Don't worry.

592
00:30:48,428 --> 00:30:50,588
I won't do that ever again.

593
00:30:52,108 --> 00:30:53,908
Since we've cleared this up,

594
00:30:54,069 --> 00:30:54,868
Yining...

♪Along the long street♪

596
00:30:58,828 --> 00:31:00,188
There's something

597
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,160
I've always wanted to tell you.

598
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:04,838
Yes, please.

599
00:31:05,888 --> 00:31:08,060
I once invited ladies
of the Luo Family to the residence

600
00:31:08,144 --> 00:31:10,300
and brought you
to the Marquis Anbei's Residence.

601
00:31:11,229 --> 00:31:12,148
They were

602
00:31:13,868 --> 00:31:15,509
all from Godbrother's order.

603
00:31:17,108 --> 00:31:17,949
I know.

604
00:31:18,288 --> 00:31:19,940
That day
at the Marquis Anbei's Residence,

605
00:31:20,108 --> 00:31:21,148
if it weren't for you,

606
00:31:21,428 --> 00:31:23,188
I wouldn't have been able to escape.

607
00:31:23,469 --> 00:31:24,828
So you knew it all along?

608
00:31:24,828 --> 00:31:25,549
Of course.

609
00:31:25,989 --> 00:31:27,029
That's why I know

610
00:31:27,108 --> 00:31:28,908
you have a kind nature.

611
00:31:29,309 --> 00:31:30,989
Besides, Grandma and Father

612
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:32,668
wouldn't raise an unruly child.

613
00:31:33,716 --> 00:31:36,512

615
00:31:43,069 --> 00:31:43,949
Old Madam Wei,

616
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:45,549
Young Lady Mingzhu is here.

617
00:31:47,069 --> 00:31:48,509
Leave us.

618
00:31:48,668 --> 00:31:49,908
Close the door.

619
00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:51,309
Yes.

620
00:31:58,828 --> 00:32:00,509
I've committed a grave mistake.

621
00:32:01,148 --> 00:32:02,348
Please punish me, Grandma.

622
00:32:03,188 --> 00:32:05,029
What have you done wrong?

623
00:32:08,224 --> 00:32:09,460
What happened earlier today

624
00:32:10,069 --> 00:32:11,069
is my doing.

625
00:32:11,469 --> 00:32:13,069
And I wanted to shift the blame
to Yining.

626
00:32:16,509 --> 00:32:18,428
Why did you do that?

627
00:32:19,509 --> 00:32:20,469
Because I'm insecure.

628
00:32:20,976 --> 00:32:22,620
Yining receives most of the attention.

629
00:32:23,229 --> 00:32:25,269
Besides, you've grown fond of her.

630
00:32:26,108 --> 00:32:28,509
I feel that the only one I can rely on

631
00:32:29,269 --> 00:32:30,388
is soon gone.

632
00:32:33,029 --> 00:32:34,428
Oh my.

633
00:32:34,949 --> 00:32:36,709
You were being foolish.

634
00:32:37,108 --> 00:32:38,469
I like Yining,

635
00:32:38,469 --> 00:32:40,229
but does that mean I don't like you?

636
00:32:41,388 --> 00:32:42,348
It's my fault.

637
00:32:43,229 --> 00:32:44,908
I barely even recognize myself

638
00:32:45,188 --> 00:32:47,628
after doing something like that.

639
00:32:50,462 --> 00:32:51,262
Get up.

640
00:32:53,148 --> 00:32:54,668
I've embarrassed you, Grandma,

641
00:32:54,949 --> 00:32:56,509
and the Wei's Residence.

642
00:32:57,069 --> 00:32:58,388
I'm too ashamed to get up.

643
00:32:58,709 --> 00:33:00,989
I knew it was you all along.

644
00:33:03,628 --> 00:33:06,549
I was waiting for you to admit it.

645
00:33:07,069 --> 00:33:08,709
I knew I could hide nothing

646
00:33:09,549 --> 00:33:11,509
from you, Grandma.

647
00:33:14,188 --> 00:33:16,789
Since you've owned up to your mistake,

648
00:33:16,868 --> 00:33:19,469
it shows you can tell right from wrong

649
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:22,668
and are willing to make it right.

650
00:33:23,428 --> 00:33:24,269
It's all right.

651
00:33:24,789 --> 00:33:25,509
Get up.

652
00:33:34,549 --> 00:33:36,428
This bottle of floral dew
is guaranteed pure.

653
00:33:36,588 --> 00:33:37,908
I've tried countless times

654
00:33:37,908 --> 00:33:39,789
before extracting this pure fragrance.

655
00:33:39,908 --> 00:33:40,668
Give it a try.

656
00:33:41,789 --> 00:33:43,509
The scent is clean and refreshing.

657
00:33:43,628 --> 00:33:44,348
By the way,

658
00:33:44,348 --> 00:33:46,188
I heard maidservants
at Duke Xu's Residence say

659
00:33:46,229 --> 00:33:48,188
that their young lady loves
the plum fragrance.

660
00:33:48,188 --> 00:33:49,309
- Really?
- Yes.

661
00:33:49,309 --> 00:33:50,388
Give me two bottles of that.

662
00:33:50,416 --> 00:33:51,300
I want two bottles of that!

663
00:33:51,309 --> 00:33:52,749
- Me too.
- I want two bottles of that.

664
00:33:53,668 --> 00:33:55,309
Shopkeeper, check, please.

665
00:33:56,229 --> 00:33:57,029
All right.

666
00:33:57,549 --> 00:33:58,628
Judging by your temperament,

667
00:33:58,709 --> 00:33:59,709
you're elegant, personable,

668
00:33:59,709 --> 00:34:00,668
and beautiful.

669
00:34:01,269 --> 00:34:02,659
Why don't you take two bottles?

670
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,600
It's a double blessing.

671
00:34:03,668 --> 00:34:04,069
Sir,

672
00:34:04,148 --> 00:34:04,939
this is bad!

673
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,240
Everyone wants the rose floral dew.

674
00:34:06,256 --> 00:34:07,900
- But it's sold out.
- Are you the owner?

675
00:34:07,908 --> 00:34:09,469
Sir, we want the rose floral dew.

676
00:34:09,469 --> 00:34:10,909
That's right, sir. We all want that.

677
00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:11,748
Ladies,

678
00:34:11,748 --> 00:34:12,909
I'm very sorry.

679
00:34:12,909 --> 00:34:13,909
We're out of stock.

680
00:34:13,909 --> 00:34:16,069
How about this?
We can sign a pre-order form.

681
00:34:16,228 --> 00:34:17,339
If you want one, pay a deposit

682
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,704
and take the product
five days later.

683
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,660
I'll take your word for take.
Five days later.

684
00:34:20,668 --> 00:34:22,588
Right. Don't break your promise.

685
00:34:22,668 --> 00:34:23,668
Of course.

686
00:34:23,748 --> 00:34:25,788
Come. Let's sign pre-order forms.

687
00:34:25,788 --> 00:34:26,349
This way.

688
00:34:26,349 --> 00:34:27,308
I want two bottles.

689
00:34:30,509 --> 00:34:31,148
Wait up.

690
00:34:38,069 --> 00:34:38,869
How's it?

691
00:34:40,029 --> 00:34:41,389
The figure we've earned today

692
00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:43,389
is more than those of previous months.

693
00:34:46,829 --> 00:34:47,628
I didn't know

694
00:34:47,632 --> 00:34:48,860
you were good at making money.

695
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:51,748
My sister didn't realize

696
00:34:51,748 --> 00:34:52,909
I inherited the Lin Family's

697
00:34:52,909 --> 00:34:53,909
business acumen.

698
00:34:54,188 --> 00:34:55,628
Sixth Uncle,

699
00:34:55,869 --> 00:34:57,339
we received so many orders today.

700
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,720
Can you prepare the products in time?

701
00:34:58,784 --> 00:35:00,060
Right. You only have five days.

702
00:35:00,829 --> 00:35:01,989
It's money.

703
00:35:03,148 --> 00:35:04,748
Money opens all doors.

704
00:35:05,588 --> 00:35:07,708
I wish for more orders to wear me out.

705
00:35:08,469 --> 00:35:09,869
Very well. Go ahead.

706
00:35:09,869 --> 00:35:10,668
I'm leaving, then.

(Marquis Anbei's Residence)

708
00:35:15,829 --> 00:35:17,619
Young Master Cheng took action

709
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,912
before Yang Ling boarded the ship.

710
00:35:18,944 --> 00:35:20,900
Chen Long and Chen Yang were shot dead,

711
00:35:21,069 --> 00:35:22,469
but Yang Ling was abducted.

712
00:35:23,989 --> 00:35:25,628
Your Lordship, do you think

713
00:35:26,069 --> 00:35:27,668
the person who abducted Yang Ling

714
00:35:28,748 --> 00:35:29,869
could be Luo Shenyuan?

715
00:35:33,069 --> 00:35:34,349
It seems we've underestimated him.

716
00:35:35,268 --> 00:35:37,108
Who else could it be except for him?

717
00:35:37,504 --> 00:35:39,180
Tell Cheng Lang
to monitor the area closely.

718
00:35:39,308 --> 00:35:41,069
You'll stay on guard
outside the capital.

719
00:35:41,392 --> 00:35:43,648
Inform me immediately
if there's any movement.

720
00:35:43,968 --> 00:35:44,848
Yes, Your Lordship.

721
00:36:14,869 --> 00:36:16,549
You're awake, Official Yang.

722
00:36:19,708 --> 00:36:20,509
Who are you?

723
00:36:21,668 --> 00:36:22,588
Don't be afraid, sir.

724
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,208
You'll know after reading the letter.

725
00:36:33,696 --> 00:36:36,080
(Vice Minister Yang boarded
a smuggler ship and he may have been framed.)

726
00:36:39,788 --> 00:36:41,029
Shenyuan sent you?

727
00:36:41,228 --> 00:36:42,029
Yes.

728
00:36:42,188 --> 00:36:44,349
Young Master worried
that Wang Yuan's men would harm you,

729
00:36:44,509 --> 00:36:46,469
so he urgently sent me here.

730
00:36:46,989 --> 00:36:47,788
Official Yang,

731
00:36:48,069 --> 00:36:49,429
they're accusing you

732
00:36:49,708 --> 00:36:51,628
of being a smuggler.

733
00:36:51,668 --> 00:36:53,029
You'll have to
conceal your identity

734
00:36:53,308 --> 00:36:54,869
if you want to go out for now.

735
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:57,308
This is utterly absurd.

736
00:36:58,069 --> 00:36:59,148
I don't know those smugglers

737
00:36:59,148 --> 00:37:00,349
at all.

738
00:37:03,108 --> 00:37:04,308
The priority now is

739
00:37:04,509 --> 00:37:05,708
to send you back to the capital

740
00:37:05,989 --> 00:37:08,148
and then find a way to clear your name.

741
00:37:09,788 --> 00:37:10,588
All right.

742
00:37:13,429 --> 00:37:14,628
This is simply a frame-up.

743
00:37:14,869 --> 00:37:16,469
I don't believe

744
00:37:16,469 --> 00:37:17,708
Yang Ling is this kind of person.

745
00:37:17,788 --> 00:37:19,549
Calm down, Master.

746
00:37:20,788 --> 00:37:22,628
The truth will only be uncovered

747
00:37:22,909 --> 00:37:24,188
if we can find Senior Yang Ling.

748
00:37:24,188 --> 00:37:24,628
But...

749
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:26,549
But the yamen

750
00:37:26,549 --> 00:37:28,188
has issued
a marine warrant everywhere

751
00:37:28,228 --> 00:37:29,469
to arrest him.

752
00:37:29,628 --> 00:37:31,668
Where's he now?

753
00:37:37,748 --> 00:37:38,989
Greetings, Father.

754
00:37:39,509 --> 00:37:40,429
Third Yong Master Luo.

755
00:37:41,268 --> 00:37:42,668
I've prepared some pastries

756
00:37:42,668 --> 00:37:44,029
for Father.

757
00:37:44,029 --> 00:37:45,869
I didn't know you were here.

758
00:37:46,549 --> 00:37:47,389
Put it there.

759
00:37:54,748 --> 00:37:56,349
I won't disturb you here, Father.

760
00:37:56,788 --> 00:37:57,748
I'll take my leave.

761
00:38:11,029 --> 00:38:12,069
Shenyuan,

762
00:38:12,909 --> 00:38:15,069
you've reached the marriageable age.

763
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,536
I discussed this matter with your father

764
00:38:18,228 --> 00:38:20,108
when I visited
the Luo's Residence last time.

765
00:38:26,668 --> 00:38:28,869
I know your ambition
has yet to be realized.

766
00:38:28,869 --> 00:38:31,509
However, men should start a family
before establishing a career.

767
00:38:31,829 --> 00:38:33,549
You can get engaged now

768
00:38:33,788 --> 00:38:35,349
and marry later.

769
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:37,668
I already have someone I like.

770
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:40,108
I'm thinking of proposing to her

771
00:38:40,389 --> 00:38:41,349
once I achieve something.

772
00:38:41,748 --> 00:38:43,069
Which family is this lady from?

773
00:38:43,308 --> 00:38:45,509
Your father didn't mention it.

774
00:38:48,668 --> 00:38:50,389
I haven't told my family about it yet.

775
00:38:51,588 --> 00:38:54,588
Master, I've made up my mind.

776
00:38:54,989 --> 00:38:56,029
I will marry no one but her.

777
00:38:57,668 --> 00:38:58,349
Well, then.

778
00:38:58,748 --> 00:39:00,069
You two aren't mean for each other.

779
00:39:05,869 --> 00:39:06,668
Young Master,

780
00:39:07,029 --> 00:39:08,419
Qi An has already rescued Official Yang

781
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:10,000
and is escorting him back
to the capital.

782
00:39:10,429 --> 00:39:11,788
But why did they

783
00:39:11,788 --> 00:39:12,949
kill all their people?

784
00:39:13,188 --> 00:39:14,108
Chen Long and Chen Yang

785
00:39:14,108 --> 00:39:15,308
were Wang Yuan's henchmen.

786
00:39:15,469 --> 00:39:17,029
This is too much of a price to pay.

787
00:39:17,549 --> 00:39:18,708
Cheng Lang left the capital

788
00:39:19,268 --> 00:39:20,588
and has likely gone to Quanzhou.

789
00:39:21,228 --> 00:39:23,588
So Lu Jiaxue intends
to eliminate all of them

790
00:39:23,588 --> 00:39:25,108
to get rid of Wang Yuan's control.

791
00:39:27,308 --> 00:39:29,668
They gather for profits
and disperse when there's nothing left.

792
00:39:29,788 --> 00:39:31,029
He's always ruthless

793
00:39:31,509 --> 00:39:33,108
when it comes to situations like this.

794
00:39:33,668 --> 00:39:34,469
Understood.

795
00:39:34,848 --> 00:39:36,220
Let's go to Duke Ying's Residence.

796
00:39:36,588 --> 00:39:37,389
Yes.

797
00:39:40,113 --> 00:39:43,557
(Huanjing Pavilion)

798
00:39:49,909 --> 00:39:51,869
Young Lady, are you drawing
the Yanrong Pavilion?

799
00:39:53,549 --> 00:39:55,308
Who are these two people?

800
00:40:02,869 --> 00:40:03,668
Young Lady,

801
00:40:03,869 --> 00:40:05,549
Madam Shen just came.

802
00:40:06,228 --> 00:40:07,989
Was it because of the Flowers Festival?

803
00:40:08,528 --> 00:40:10,260
Old Madam Wei told her
everything frankly.

804
00:40:10,349 --> 00:40:12,349
Madam Shen didn't say anything.

805
00:40:12,829 --> 00:40:14,469
Grandma is an honest person,

806
00:40:14,748 --> 00:40:16,989
so they wouldn't pursue it.

807
00:40:17,308 --> 00:40:18,869
Aside from this,

808
00:40:19,108 --> 00:40:20,308
Madam Shen came here

809
00:40:20,308 --> 00:40:22,108
mainly because of the proposal to you.

810
00:40:22,668 --> 00:40:23,509
Proposal?

811
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:25,509
Duke Ying just returned,

812
00:40:25,509 --> 00:40:27,268
and Old Madam Wei sent for him.

813
00:40:30,593 --> 00:40:31,389
What?

814
00:40:32,108 --> 00:40:33,748
The Shen Family also wants
to marry Yining?

815
00:40:33,989 --> 00:40:35,469
What's with that face?

816
00:40:36,549 --> 00:40:37,509
You seem like the enemy

817
00:40:37,509 --> 00:40:39,469
has arrived on your doorstep.

818
00:40:43,029 --> 00:40:45,228
It seems that my daughter
is too outstanding.

819
00:40:45,469 --> 00:40:48,069
So many people approve of her
just as she returns.

820
00:40:48,228 --> 00:40:50,708
Yining has reached

821
00:40:50,708 --> 00:40:52,188
the marriageable age.

822
00:40:53,668 --> 00:40:55,469
The Shen Family is an earl.

823
00:40:55,748 --> 00:40:58,069
They're considered a prestigious family.

824
00:40:58,069 --> 00:40:59,509
I don't care who they are.

825
00:41:00,869 --> 00:41:03,069
Mother, I've made up my mind.

826
00:41:03,748 --> 00:41:06,108
I won't consider
Yining's marriage for now.

827
00:41:06,469 --> 00:41:09,228
Besides, if I were
to choose a son-in-law,

828
00:41:09,708 --> 00:41:10,909
I only have a request.

829
00:41:11,509 --> 00:41:12,869
Yining has to like the man.

830
00:41:13,268 --> 00:41:15,308
As long as she likes him
and he has good character,

831
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:16,768
I won't reject him even if he comes

832
00:41:16,768 --> 00:41:17,660
from a humble root.

833
00:41:17,708 --> 00:41:19,029
Children's marriages

834
00:41:19,029 --> 00:41:20,909
are decided by parents

835
00:41:20,909 --> 00:41:22,469
and arranged by matchmakers.

836
00:41:22,509 --> 00:41:24,668
Daughters can't decide for themselves.

837
00:41:24,788 --> 00:41:27,069
That may be what other families do,

838
00:41:27,069 --> 00:41:28,909
I won't comment on that. But my daughter

839
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,361
has to marry a man she likes.
She will decide for herself.

840
00:41:31,549 --> 00:41:32,668
I know

841
00:41:32,748 --> 00:41:34,389
you're worried about Yining's future.

842
00:41:34,668 --> 00:41:36,029
But I'm afraid

843
00:41:36,029 --> 00:41:38,308
that if you're too picky,

844
00:41:38,308 --> 00:41:40,188
you'll delay her marriage.

845
00:41:40,509 --> 00:41:41,389
I don't care.

846
00:41:42,108 --> 00:41:43,949
If Yining has a man she likes,

847
00:41:44,108 --> 00:41:46,509
I don't mind personally proposing
marriage to him.

848
00:41:46,549 --> 00:41:48,949
But if she doesn't have any, I'd rather

849
00:41:48,949 --> 00:41:50,429
provide for her
for her whole life.

850
00:41:50,429 --> 00:41:52,228
Did you hear yourself?

851
00:42:00,869 --> 00:42:01,668
Mother,

852
00:42:02,029 --> 00:42:03,188
I've heard something

853
00:42:03,228 --> 00:42:04,628
about Young Master Shen.

854
00:42:04,909 --> 00:42:06,108
He's not knowledgeable

855
00:42:06,108 --> 00:42:07,308
and incompetent.

856
00:42:07,668 --> 00:42:10,108
How could our Yining marry him?

857
00:42:10,108 --> 00:42:11,029
Right?

858
00:42:11,029 --> 00:42:12,228
Shen Yu

859
00:42:12,708 --> 00:42:14,469
is a bit lacking.

860
00:42:14,829 --> 00:42:16,188
That's not a bit.

861
00:42:16,268 --> 00:42:18,029
But you haven't even asked Yining,

862
00:42:18,069 --> 00:42:20,748
how do you know she doesn't
like the Shen Family?

863
00:42:20,748 --> 00:42:21,949
There's no need to ask.

864
00:42:21,949 --> 00:42:23,308
Everyone in the capital

865
00:42:23,308 --> 00:42:25,708
knows what kind of a person he is.

866
00:42:26,069 --> 00:42:26,748
Mother,

867
00:42:27,148 --> 00:42:29,429
if you don't believe me,
you can call for her.

868
00:42:30,349 --> 00:42:32,469
Grandma, Father.

869
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,660
I've heard your conversation

870
00:42:33,668 --> 00:42:35,268
from outside just now.

871
00:42:35,268 --> 00:42:36,549
That Young Master Shen...

872
00:42:36,549 --> 00:42:37,509
Don't worry, Father.

873
00:42:37,989 --> 00:42:39,069
I'm not interested

874
00:42:39,308 --> 00:42:40,469
in him.

875
00:42:40,708 --> 00:42:41,509
See?

876
00:42:41,668 --> 00:42:42,628
I told you.

877
00:42:42,628 --> 00:42:44,588
My daughter won't like him.

878
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,360
Yining,

879
00:42:47,429 --> 00:42:48,429
your father

880
00:42:48,429 --> 00:42:50,829
really can't bear to leave you.

881
00:42:50,829 --> 00:42:51,668
Even so,

882
00:42:52,228 --> 00:42:54,869
you're of marriageable age.

883
00:42:55,588 --> 00:42:57,268
Your grandma has a point.

884
00:42:57,349 --> 00:42:59,228
You've reached marriageable age now.

885
00:42:59,708 --> 00:43:01,748
I'd like to ask you

886
00:43:02,148 --> 00:43:03,188
if you have anyone

887
00:43:03,989 --> 00:43:05,748
you like now.

888
00:43:06,349 --> 00:43:07,308
Right.

889
00:43:07,349 --> 00:43:08,869
What kind of man do you like?

890
00:43:08,869 --> 00:43:09,748
Tell us.

891
00:43:09,748 --> 00:43:12,268
Your father and I would like
to listen about it.

892
00:43:13,869 --> 00:43:15,268
The man I like

893
00:43:15,349 --> 00:43:17,509
should be dashing,

894
00:43:17,549 --> 00:43:18,668
have excellent character

895
00:43:18,869 --> 00:43:19,869
and talent,

896
00:43:19,869 --> 00:43:21,349
not just book-smart,

897
00:43:21,668 --> 00:43:22,588
aware of the world

898
00:43:22,588 --> 00:43:23,869
but not overly sophisticated,

899
00:43:24,509 --> 00:43:25,509
skilled in martial arts,

900
00:43:26,148 --> 00:43:27,268
resilient,

901
00:43:27,829 --> 00:43:30,108
and must cherish me.

902
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:31,148
When I'm with him,

903
00:43:31,148 --> 00:43:33,029
he'll understand what I truly want

904
00:43:33,029 --> 00:43:35,029
and make me feel secure.
