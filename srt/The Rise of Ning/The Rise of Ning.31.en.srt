(Adapted from Wen Tan's novel "Chancellor
Training Handbook" from Jinjiang Literature)

00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:38,485
=Episode 31=

4
00:01:39,994 --> 00:01:41,321
(Huanjing Pavilion)

5
00:01:48,298 --> 00:01:49,739
Oh my god.

6
00:01:49,778 --> 00:01:51,938
Young Lady Yining is only staying
for a few days.

7
00:01:51,938 --> 00:01:53,699
Duke Ying would spare no effort to give

8
00:01:53,699 --> 00:01:55,218
her all the best things
in the world.

9
00:01:55,218 --> 00:01:56,578
She's Duke Ying's birth daughter.

10
00:01:56,578 --> 00:01:58,018
She was finally found after so long.

11
00:01:58,018 --> 00:01:59,858
Naturally, she'll be treasured
above all else.

12
00:01:59,938 --> 00:02:00,778
I used

13
00:02:00,778 --> 00:02:01,938
to think Young Lady Mingzhu

14
00:02:01,938 --> 00:02:03,539
was treasured beyond measure.

15
00:02:03,539 --> 00:02:04,539
But after seeing it today,

16
00:02:04,539 --> 00:02:05,619
the difference is clear.

17
00:02:05,619 --> 00:02:06,169
You're right.

18
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:07,040
Just look at this yard.

19
00:02:07,104 --> 00:02:08,530
It fits for a princess.

20
00:02:08,538 --> 00:02:09,218
That's right.

21
00:02:15,681 --> 00:02:18,008
(Huanjing Pavilion)

22
00:02:23,658 --> 00:02:24,299
Father.

23
00:02:26,419 --> 00:02:28,658
Mingzhu? What brings you here?

24
00:02:29,019 --> 00:02:30,658
I heard Yining is coming.

25
00:02:30,978 --> 00:02:32,419
I specially selected

26
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:34,098
a pair of white porcelain flower vases

27
00:02:34,179 --> 00:02:35,139
for her.

28
00:02:41,818 --> 00:02:43,498
Do you not like them?

29
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:48,258
Place the teacups here.

30
00:02:49,179 --> 00:02:49,859
Over here.

31
00:02:57,299 --> 00:02:58,089
Young Lady,

32
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:00,128
you went through the trouble
of picking out these vases

33
00:03:00,144 --> 00:03:01,040
to send over.

34
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,040
Why did the Duke Ying not like them?

35
00:03:03,698 --> 00:03:05,179
Father has always been away at war

36
00:03:05,378 --> 00:03:06,579
and hasn't been close to me.

37
00:03:06,818 --> 00:03:08,139
Even so,

38
00:03:08,299 --> 00:03:10,059
Young Lady Yining has yet to move back.

39
00:03:10,192 --> 00:03:11,890
But Duke Ying already treats you
this way.

40
00:03:11,978 --> 00:03:12,938
Doesn't that mean

41
00:03:12,938 --> 00:03:14,498
he'll be even more partial
in the future?

42
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,850
Let's not think about that.

43
00:03:18,538 --> 00:03:20,299
Grandma has always favored me.

44
00:03:20,619 --> 00:03:22,059
She wouldn't change so easily.

45
00:03:22,538 --> 00:03:23,698
I still have Ting, too.

46
00:03:24,299 --> 00:03:26,299
He only acknowledges me as his sister.

47
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,219
(Duke Ying's Residence)

48
00:03:37,698 --> 00:03:38,059
Thrust!

49
00:03:38,739 --> 00:03:39,179
Retract!

50
00:03:40,179 --> 00:03:40,538
Jab!

51
00:03:40,899 --> 00:03:42,258
Thrust! Retract!

52
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:43,498
Thrust!

53
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,320
Retract!

54
00:03:44,352 --> 00:03:45,810
Ting has improved.

55
00:03:45,818 --> 00:03:46,339
Thrust!

56
00:03:46,739 --> 00:03:47,098
Retract!

57
00:03:47,498 --> 00:03:47,859
Jab!

58
00:03:48,698 --> 00:03:49,859
Not bad.

59
00:03:51,059 --> 00:03:53,459
Wei Ting, you made a lot of progress.

60
00:03:56,179 --> 00:03:56,978
Father.

61
00:03:59,059 --> 00:03:59,859
Mother.

62
00:04:11,258 --> 00:04:11,619
Come on.

63
00:04:11,938 --> 00:04:13,299
Yining, don't just stand there.

64
00:04:13,299 --> 00:04:14,778
Greet your grandma.

65
00:04:20,099 --> 00:04:21,698
Greetings, Old Madam Wei.

66
00:04:21,698 --> 00:04:23,859
I wish you good health.

67
00:04:28,299 --> 00:04:30,299
You can get up. The floor is cold.

68
00:04:35,419 --> 00:04:36,619
This is Mingzhu.

69
00:04:36,739 --> 00:04:38,898
She grew up here

70
00:04:38,898 --> 00:04:40,258
and is a year younger than you.

71
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:41,458
From now on,

72
00:04:41,818 --> 00:04:44,659
you are the legitimate Young Lady
of this residence.

73
00:04:44,859 --> 00:04:46,818
She will be your younger sister.

74
00:04:46,859 --> 00:04:48,578
I hope both of you will get along

75
00:04:48,818 --> 00:04:50,219
and support each other.

76
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:53,779
Hello, Yining.

77
00:04:54,498 --> 00:04:55,979
Hello, Mingzhu.

78
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:00,659
Ting,

79
00:05:01,739 --> 00:05:02,818
say hello.

80
00:05:03,659 --> 00:05:05,578
She's your sister.

81
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,240
Aren't you the lady

82
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,600
from the Luo's Residence?

83
00:05:08,739 --> 00:05:10,378
How did you become my birth sister?

84
00:05:10,619 --> 00:05:12,138
Just do as I say and greet your sister.

85
00:05:12,138 --> 00:05:13,299
Stop talking nonsense.

86
00:05:13,498 --> 00:05:14,299
It's all right.

87
00:05:22,018 --> 00:05:22,818
Today,

88
00:05:23,099 --> 00:05:25,099
I had the kitchen prepare
a lot of delicious dishes.

89
00:05:25,338 --> 00:05:26,859
After dinner,

90
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:29,299
let your sister take you both
to set off fireworks.

91
00:05:29,299 --> 00:05:30,619
There are plenty this year.

92
00:05:30,619 --> 00:05:31,809
They were sent from the palace.

93
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,616
You can enjoy them
as much as you like, okay?

94
00:05:33,698 --> 00:05:35,299
Is there honey-mixed yam today?

95
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:37,696
You always get a rash from it.
Why do you still love eating it?

96
00:05:38,688 --> 00:05:40,610
Once it's thoroughly cooked,
it should be fine.

97
00:05:40,619 --> 00:05:41,539
Just instruct the kitchen

98
00:05:41,539 --> 00:05:43,299
to keep the yam somewhere safe.

99
00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:45,698
Make sure Wei Ting doesn't grab them,

100
00:05:45,698 --> 00:05:46,859
and it'll be fine.

101
00:05:47,099 --> 00:05:47,859
Don't you agree?

102
00:05:50,304 --> 00:05:51,370
Let's have dinner, then.

103
00:06:09,818 --> 00:06:10,619
Grandma,

104
00:06:11,059 --> 00:06:12,779
Second Uncle, Second Aunt.

105
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:14,898
I'm here to bid farewell.

106
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,399
Shanyuan,

107
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,121
I especially

108
00:06:28,468 --> 00:06:32,498
had this pair of shoes
custom-made for you.

109
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:35,179
You grew up in this home all your life

110
00:06:35,659 --> 00:06:37,099
and haven't experienced hardship.

111
00:06:37,488 --> 00:06:39,130
You're leaving home for the first time.

112
00:06:40,219 --> 00:06:42,458
So make sure to take care of yourself

113
00:06:43,498 --> 00:06:45,498
and don't let me worry.

114
00:06:46,578 --> 00:06:47,619
Thank you, Grandma.

115
00:06:53,818 --> 00:06:54,619
Shanyuan.

116
00:06:55,219 --> 00:06:56,419
Although it's a military camp,

117
00:06:56,739 --> 00:06:58,219
some arrangements are still necessary.

118
00:06:58,416 --> 00:06:59,610
Spend what needs to be spent

119
00:06:59,728 --> 00:07:01,250
and don't make things hard on yourself.

120
00:07:02,272 --> 00:07:03,290
Thank you, Second Aunt.

121
00:07:04,018 --> 00:07:06,258
Shanyuan, today is New Year's Eve.

122
00:07:06,624 --> 00:07:08,170
Why don't you leave after the New Year?

123
00:07:08,698 --> 00:07:09,698
The journey is long.

124
00:07:10,099 --> 00:07:11,698
I should set off early.

125
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:14,659
It doesn't concern you
in the matter of the adults.

126
00:07:15,299 --> 00:07:16,619
Don't worry about it.

127
00:07:16,619 --> 00:07:17,698
If you face any difficulties,

128
00:07:18,698 --> 00:07:20,419
be sure to tell the family.

129
00:07:20,938 --> 00:07:21,898
Thank you, Second Uncle.

130
00:07:32,258 --> 00:07:33,059
Fourth Brother,

131
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,370
here's some bruise

132
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:37,840
and injury medicine from Sixth Uncle.

133
00:07:38,338 --> 00:07:39,138
It's very effective.

134
00:07:42,179 --> 00:07:42,979
Third Brother,

135
00:07:44,258 --> 00:07:45,099
I'm sorry.

136
00:07:45,659 --> 00:07:46,779
It's already in the past.

137
00:07:46,784 --> 00:07:48,224
There's no need
to bring it up anymore.

138
00:07:50,299 --> 00:07:51,099
Family

139
00:07:51,898 --> 00:07:53,059
will always be family.

140
00:08:05,898 --> 00:08:06,859
Don't cry.

141
00:08:07,299 --> 00:08:08,498
I'm joining the army

142
00:08:09,099 --> 00:08:10,619
to protect and serve the country.

143
00:08:11,258 --> 00:08:12,578
Take good care of Grandma,

144
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:14,336
as well as Second Uncle and Second Aunt.

145
00:08:14,938 --> 00:08:15,779
Be good.

146
00:08:51,458 --> 00:08:52,499
Take care, Grandma.

147
00:09:11,019 --> 00:09:11,818
Mother.

148
00:09:12,259 --> 00:09:13,698
It's a good thing

149
00:09:13,698 --> 00:09:15,098
that Shan has the ambition

150
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:16,560
to go out and fight for a chance.

151
00:09:17,299 --> 00:09:18,899
If anything were to happen,

152
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,499
Shenyuan would definitely help him.

153
00:09:20,499 --> 00:09:21,698
You can rest assured.

154
00:09:23,938 --> 00:09:24,779
Chen Lan committed

155
00:09:25,179 --> 00:09:27,858
such a despicable act.

156
00:09:28,299 --> 00:09:29,499
Look at how Chengwen

157
00:09:29,659 --> 00:09:32,218
left just like that
without spending the New Year here.

158
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:35,698
The principal home
has completely fallen apart.

159
00:09:36,539 --> 00:09:37,419
Fortunately,

160
00:09:37,858 --> 00:09:40,139
Yiyu has married into the Liu family

161
00:09:40,139 --> 00:09:41,499
and is favored.

162
00:09:41,499 --> 00:09:44,659
Shan also regained his spirits.

163
00:09:44,938 --> 00:09:48,098
What worries me the most right now

164
00:09:48,539 --> 00:09:49,978
is Yixiu.

165
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:00,259
Father has been assigned elsewhere,

166
00:10:00,738 --> 00:10:02,419
Shan is joining the army,

167
00:10:02,512 --> 00:10:04,570
and Seventh Sister
and the rest are also not here.

168
00:10:05,499 --> 00:10:06,539
Mother...

169
00:10:10,299 --> 00:10:11,818
I can't believe

170
00:10:12,338 --> 00:10:14,299
I'm the only one left
in the principal home.

171
00:10:14,659 --> 00:10:16,698
Young Lady, don't be sad.

172
00:10:17,019 --> 00:10:18,858
Well, you still have Young Master Lin.

173
00:10:19,499 --> 00:10:21,218
He's not family.

174
00:10:57,259 --> 00:10:58,698
What are you doing?

175
00:10:58,784 --> 00:11:00,490
Last time we agreed to go
to the night market,

176
00:11:00,499 --> 00:11:01,698
but it didn't happen.

177
00:11:01,792 --> 00:11:03,090
This time, I'll make it up to you.

178
00:11:05,059 --> 00:11:05,858
Yixiu,

179
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:07,098
come here.

180
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:50,729
The shop hasn't even made
much money yet,

181
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:52,192
and you're already spending recklessly.

182
00:11:52,256 --> 00:11:52,930
Then

183
00:11:53,738 --> 00:11:54,858
do you like it

184
00:11:55,419 --> 00:11:56,499
or not?

185
00:11:59,098 --> 00:12:00,499
Is this considered a night market?

186
00:12:05,019 --> 00:12:06,299
Spirits of heaven and earth.

187
00:12:06,618 --> 00:12:07,858
Light fairy, show yourself!

188
00:12:08,419 --> 00:12:09,698
Bless me so I can make

189
00:12:09,698 --> 00:12:10,659
my beloved happy.

190
00:12:10,858 --> 00:12:11,899
Stop being silly.

191
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:15,698
The light fairy has responded!

192
00:12:16,179 --> 00:12:16,659
Look.

193
00:12:17,698 --> 00:12:18,499
What's this?

194
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:20,299
Liuhe Tavern's Mutton Fat Pastry.

195
00:12:21,499 --> 00:12:22,299
Try it.

196
00:12:29,072 --> 00:12:30,650
This is your favorite scented sachet.

197
00:12:40,698 --> 00:12:42,049
This is the fragrance you wanted

198
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:43,392
the last time we were out together.

199
00:12:51,419 --> 00:12:52,499
You finally smile.

200
00:13:06,712 --> 00:13:09,250
(Marry Luo Yixiu as a wife)

201
00:13:15,618 --> 00:13:16,179
Yixiu!

202
00:13:26,098 --> 00:13:27,419
What's on your mind?

203
00:13:31,419 --> 00:13:32,458
Say something.

204
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:34,299
Both of us

205
00:13:34,698 --> 00:13:35,858
are already here.

206
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:38,019
Why did you have to use that to ask me?

207
00:13:43,059 --> 00:13:43,978
Luo Yixiu!

208
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:46,698
Are you willing to marry me?

209
00:13:48,419 --> 00:13:49,499
Many people are watching.

210
00:13:49,499 --> 00:13:52,738
- Say yes!
- Say yes!

211
00:13:52,738 --> 00:13:53,899
Why did you do that?

212
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,152
There are so many people around.

213
00:13:56,458 --> 00:13:57,858
Say yes!

214
00:13:58,818 --> 00:14:00,299
I only want you to know

215
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:02,179
that I, Lin Mao,

216
00:14:03,499 --> 00:14:05,098
will only marry you in this lifetime.

217
00:14:33,818 --> 00:14:34,618
Father.

218
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:37,578
Mother.

219
00:14:38,139 --> 00:14:38,938
Drop the formality.

220
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:40,769
Take a seat.

221
00:14:42,419 --> 00:14:43,218
Then

222
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,379
shall we start eating now?

223
00:14:44,618 --> 00:14:45,419
Yes.

224
00:14:46,698 --> 00:14:47,379
Yixiu, try this.

225
00:14:47,379 --> 00:14:48,618
There's no alcohol?

226
00:14:48,618 --> 00:14:48,899
Sure.

227
00:14:49,411 --> 00:14:50,212
Have a taste.

228
00:14:50,259 --> 00:14:51,779
Every New Year is the same every year.

229
00:14:52,098 --> 00:14:54,659
But there are fewer
and fewer people around.

230
00:14:55,659 --> 00:14:57,499
Just listen to what you've just said.

231
00:14:57,698 --> 00:14:59,059
You're bringing down my mood again.

232
00:14:59,059 --> 00:15:01,218
Why are you like this
during the New Year?

233
00:15:01,338 --> 00:15:03,659
You made me miss Yining.

234
00:15:05,024 --> 00:15:06,784
You're right. Let's eat.

235
00:15:08,059 --> 00:15:09,618
Everything today is your favorite.

236
00:15:12,938 --> 00:15:13,539
Eat more.

237
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:19,500
(Chengjing Hall)

238
00:15:19,673 --> 00:15:23,805
(Duke Ying's Residence)

239
00:15:24,899 --> 00:15:27,299
Today is New Year's Eve.

240
00:15:35,818 --> 00:15:36,618
One cup.

241
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:38,698
I said today is New Year's Eve.

242
00:15:39,818 --> 00:15:40,899
Then half a cup.

243
00:15:41,019 --> 00:15:41,818
You...

244
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:48,818
Fine. One cup, it is.

245
00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:50,578
Here.

246
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:54,899
Unbelievable.

247
00:15:56,059 --> 00:15:58,659
Back in the day,
when I was in the military camp,

248
00:15:58,899 --> 00:16:00,098
the soldiers

249
00:16:00,098 --> 00:16:02,618
and I would drink straight from the jar.

250
00:16:02,618 --> 00:16:03,899
I wouldn't get drunk, you know?

251
00:16:04,059 --> 00:16:06,098
Now that I'm old,

252
00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:07,299
you're controlling me.

253
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,978
I don't even have the freedom
to drink anymore.

254
00:16:11,659 --> 00:16:13,059
Grandma, slowly.

255
00:16:13,338 --> 00:16:15,299
How old do you think you are now?

256
00:16:16,192 --> 00:16:17,696
How can you compare it to the past?

257
00:16:17,738 --> 00:16:19,259
Put aside about not getting drunk.

258
00:16:19,259 --> 00:16:20,618
After finishing just this one cup,

259
00:16:20,618 --> 00:16:21,698
we don't even know if your

260
00:16:21,698 --> 00:16:22,818
old illness will flare up.

261
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:24,179
I'm not the one in pain anyway.

262
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:27,299
Grandma, Father is doing this

263
00:16:27,299 --> 00:16:28,659
for your sake.

264
00:16:28,698 --> 00:16:30,499
Don't you remember the last time

265
00:16:30,499 --> 00:16:31,890
your old shoulder injury acted up?

266
00:16:31,899 --> 00:16:32,698
The pain

267
00:16:32,698 --> 00:16:34,419
kept you awake all night.

268
00:16:34,419 --> 00:16:35,059
I remember

269
00:16:35,059 --> 00:16:36,299
you said

270
00:16:36,299 --> 00:16:37,899
that you wouldn't drink again.

271
00:16:38,419 --> 00:16:39,858
You little boy.

272
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,759
You can't take
what a patient says seriously.

273
00:16:45,059 --> 00:16:45,938
Every New Year,

274
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:47,818
your grandma always pulls this act.

275
00:16:49,738 --> 00:16:50,738
Where's the alcohol?

276
00:16:50,738 --> 00:16:51,899
Fill my daughter's cup.

277
00:16:52,899 --> 00:16:53,379
Fill it up.

278
00:16:53,818 --> 00:16:55,499
You have the blood of our Wei family.

279
00:16:55,499 --> 00:16:56,858
Surely you can drink a little.

280
00:17:00,618 --> 00:17:01,299
Here.

281
00:17:04,418 --> 00:17:07,299
Yining, have some pigeon.

282
00:17:07,739 --> 00:17:10,098
This is the cook's specialty.

283
00:17:10,219 --> 00:17:11,818
Every year,

284
00:17:11,818 --> 00:17:13,459
Ting would finish his own portion

285
00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:14,699
and swap seats with others

286
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:16,059
to eat their portion.

287
00:17:22,259 --> 00:17:24,378
Duke Ying,
someone from the palace has arrived.

288
00:17:24,618 --> 00:17:26,699
Duke Ying,
His Majesty has issued a decree.

289
00:17:36,418 --> 00:17:39,259
I, Wei Ling, await the decree.

290
00:17:39,939 --> 00:17:41,138
Duke Ying, Wei Ling

291
00:17:41,138 --> 00:17:43,699
has served the country
and its people with utmost dedication,

292
00:17:43,858 --> 00:17:46,499
making him a pillar of the nation
and contributing greatly to the state.

293
00:17:46,818 --> 00:17:49,939
I learned that Duke Ning had found
his long-lost daughter

294
00:17:49,939 --> 00:17:51,259
and finally reunited.

295
00:17:51,259 --> 00:17:52,618
I feel deeply gratified.

296
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:54,378
Therefore, I grant Wei Yining

297
00:17:54,539 --> 00:17:56,259
the title
of County Princess of Qingcheng.

298
00:17:56,499 --> 00:17:57,858
May this be carried out

299
00:17:58,098 --> 00:17:59,338
with honor.

300
00:17:59,658 --> 00:18:01,059
Thank you, Your Majesty.

301
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:05,824
County Princess of Qingcheng,
please receive the decree.

302
00:18:11,138 --> 00:18:11,939
Yining.

303
00:18:12,378 --> 00:18:13,178
Yining.

304
00:18:14,699 --> 00:18:15,979
Go and receive the decree.

305
00:18:19,338 --> 00:18:20,499
I shall receive the decree.

306
00:18:24,499 --> 00:18:25,658
Duke Ying, please rise.

307
00:18:25,658 --> 00:18:26,818
Old Madam Wei, please rise.

308
00:18:31,539 --> 00:18:33,499
Congratulations,
Duke Ying, Old Madam Wei,

309
00:18:33,499 --> 00:18:34,495
and Princess Qingcheng.

310
00:18:34,496 --> 00:18:36,090
I have some matters
to attend to at the palace.

311
00:18:36,098 --> 00:18:37,818
So I shall take my leave now.

312
00:18:38,338 --> 00:18:40,259
Thank you. Allow me to send you off.

313
00:18:41,088 --> 00:18:41,840
This way, please.

314
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,614
(Duke Ying's Residence)

315
00:18:49,739 --> 00:18:50,539
Sir,

316
00:18:50,816 --> 00:18:53,168
His Majesty has countless matters
to attend to each day.

317
00:18:53,259 --> 00:18:55,699
How could he be so concerned
about such trivial matters

318
00:18:55,699 --> 00:18:56,858
in our family?

319
00:18:56,858 --> 00:18:57,898
Even though His Majesty is busy,

320
00:18:57,898 --> 00:19:00,178
he is still concerned
about everything.

321
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:02,906
Besides, Marquis Lu would remind him
from the side.

322
00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:04,658
His Majesty's favor

323
00:19:04,898 --> 00:19:06,299
is only natural.

324
00:19:07,259 --> 00:19:08,409
Thank you for the trouble.

325
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:09,840
Duke Ying, you don't have
to send further.

326
00:19:14,939 --> 00:19:17,178
(How does Lu Jiaxue have the time)

327
00:19:17,259 --> 00:19:18,898
(to involve himself in my family affairs?)

328
00:19:32,699 --> 00:19:33,858
Why did you stop eating?

329
00:19:34,658 --> 00:19:36,059
Enjoy your food and drinks.

330
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:38,299
Just look at what you did.

331
00:19:38,539 --> 00:19:40,178
Even His Majesty knows now.

332
00:19:40,539 --> 00:19:42,299
Watch out for those

333
00:19:42,338 --> 00:19:44,259
who might use your reputation
for their own gain.

334
00:19:45,658 --> 00:19:46,898
You're overthinking.

335
00:19:47,098 --> 00:19:49,059
If someone wanted to do that,

336
00:19:49,059 --> 00:19:50,539
His Majesty wouldn't grant Yining

337
00:19:50,539 --> 00:19:52,779
as the County Princess of Qingcheng.
Am I right?

338
00:19:57,898 --> 00:19:58,898
Yining,

339
00:19:59,418 --> 00:20:02,699
I heard you have a rouge shop.

340
00:20:03,138 --> 00:20:03,939
Yes,

341
00:20:04,739 --> 00:20:05,818
it's called Yanrong Pavilion.

342
00:20:06,459 --> 00:20:08,979
Close it down tomorrow

343
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:11,098
and move back here.

344
00:20:12,979 --> 00:20:13,699
Mother.

345
00:20:13,699 --> 00:20:15,658
If it weren't for the decree,

346
00:20:15,658 --> 00:20:16,939
I would have kept

347
00:20:16,939 --> 00:20:18,658
a blind eye on it.

348
00:20:18,779 --> 00:20:19,578
But

349
00:20:19,939 --> 00:20:21,858
you're someone with a title

350
00:20:21,898 --> 00:20:23,658
and a status now.

351
00:20:23,658 --> 00:20:25,459
If you keep doing business

352
00:20:25,459 --> 00:20:26,499
so openly,

353
00:20:26,539 --> 00:20:28,779
you're bound to attract criticism.

354
00:20:29,779 --> 00:20:30,578
Mother.

355
00:20:34,299 --> 00:20:35,178
Over the years,

356
00:20:35,338 --> 00:20:37,499
we've faced plenty of criticism.

357
00:20:37,499 --> 00:20:38,658
Since when are you afraid of it?

358
00:20:38,658 --> 00:20:39,898
Here, have another cup.

359
00:20:39,898 --> 00:20:41,898
Yes, I was never afraid.

360
00:20:42,898 --> 00:20:45,178
But there's really no need for this.

361
00:20:45,259 --> 00:20:47,418
Our family isn't short on money.

362
00:20:47,858 --> 00:20:49,499
If she needs something,

363
00:20:49,658 --> 00:20:51,578
she can just ask.

364
00:20:51,616 --> 00:20:53,570
- Mother.
- I'm hoping for your understanding.

365
00:20:56,499 --> 00:20:58,299
Yanrong Pavilion is my hard work.

366
00:20:58,858 --> 00:21:00,418
If you insist on it,

367
00:21:00,739 --> 00:21:02,259
you can report to His Majesty

368
00:21:02,658 --> 00:21:03,499
that

369
00:21:04,059 --> 00:21:06,618
the matter of my background
is purely a misunderstanding.

370
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:10,259
Yining, what are you saying?

371
00:21:10,499 --> 00:21:11,299
Yining,

372
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:14,299
are you threatening me?

373
00:21:14,418 --> 00:21:15,378
I dare not.

374
00:21:20,818 --> 00:21:21,699
Yining,

375
00:21:22,098 --> 00:21:24,219
how could you speak
to Grandma like that?

376
00:21:24,459 --> 00:21:25,378
If Grandma reports

377
00:21:25,499 --> 00:21:26,299
to His Majesty,

378
00:21:26,299 --> 00:21:28,299
you won't be part
of Duke Ying's household anymore.

379
00:21:28,299 --> 00:21:29,858
Don't even think
about shaming the family.

380
00:21:29,858 --> 00:21:30,779
What did you say?

381
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,970
I dare you to say it again.

382
00:21:32,219 --> 00:21:34,299
Father, among all occupations,

383
00:21:34,699 --> 00:21:36,858
merchants are considered
the lowest class.

384
00:21:38,499 --> 00:21:39,299
Outrageous!

385
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:40,499
Who taught you that?

386
00:21:44,499 --> 00:21:45,618
Our Wei family

387
00:21:45,898 --> 00:21:47,138
has made a name for itself

388
00:21:47,138 --> 00:21:48,219
through success

389
00:21:48,219 --> 00:21:49,299
on the battlefield.

390
00:21:49,499 --> 00:21:51,418
One must understand

391
00:21:51,658 --> 00:21:52,939
that achievements are earned

392
00:21:52,939 --> 00:21:54,299
through one's own abilities.

393
00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:56,059
At such a young age,

394
00:21:56,499 --> 00:21:58,418
you're already judging others
based on status.

395
00:21:58,459 --> 00:22:00,690
When you grow up,
will you use your power to bully others?

396
00:22:02,858 --> 00:22:05,499
Yining relies on her own true skills

397
00:22:05,499 --> 00:22:07,378
in doing business, not on others.

398
00:22:07,539 --> 00:22:08,418
But

399
00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:11,059
you grow up without the ability
to support yourself

400
00:22:11,299 --> 00:22:12,459
and live off your family.

401
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:13,499
Now, that's truly

402
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,059
the lowest class, understand?

403
00:22:15,098 --> 00:22:16,609
Grandma forbids her
to run the business.

404
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:17,328
Mingzhu said

405
00:22:17,392 --> 00:22:18,490
merchants are of low status.

406
00:22:18,499 --> 00:22:19,818
Why did you have to scold me?

407
00:22:23,299 --> 00:22:24,178
Zhao Mingzhu.

408
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:28,098
Father.

409
00:22:28,459 --> 00:22:30,219
While I was explaining the book to Ting,

410
00:22:30,299 --> 00:22:31,499
I did casually say it

411
00:22:31,658 --> 00:22:33,898
because it was mentioned in the book.

412
00:22:34,739 --> 00:22:36,739
But I definitely didn't mean

413
00:22:36,739 --> 00:22:38,299
that Yining is a low-class merchant.

414
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:40,384
Both of you better listen
to me carefully.

415
00:22:40,499 --> 00:22:42,019
If it weren't

416
00:22:42,019 --> 00:22:43,299
for the fact that today is

417
00:22:43,299 --> 00:22:44,618
Yining's first New Year
at home,

418
00:22:44,618 --> 00:22:45,858
I wouldn't let you off the hook.

419
00:22:46,704 --> 00:22:48,560
At such a young age,
you speak without thinking,

420
00:22:48,578 --> 00:22:50,559
and you still think you're reasonable?
You...

421
00:22:50,898 --> 00:22:52,098
- You dare to rebel!
- Ting!

422
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:54,779
That's enough.

423
00:22:55,299 --> 00:22:58,019
You could have chosen
the right time to educate him.

424
00:22:58,059 --> 00:22:59,418
What is all this?

425
00:22:59,459 --> 00:23:01,299
I've lost my appetite already.

426
00:23:05,098 --> 00:23:06,019
Mother.

427
00:23:42,338 --> 00:23:43,098
Is it pretty?

428
00:23:47,616 --> 00:23:49,792
Do you want me to accompany you
to set the fireworks?

429
00:23:50,299 --> 00:23:51,059
It's all right.

430
00:23:52,418 --> 00:23:53,299
I want

431
00:23:54,048 --> 00:23:55,696
to go back to the Luo's Residence.

432
00:24:01,858 --> 00:24:03,898
That's fine. It's the New Year's, right?

433
00:24:05,338 --> 00:24:07,658
I'm sorry you had a tough time today.

434
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:10,898
Your grandma is straightforward
and quick-tempered.

435
00:24:11,578 --> 00:24:13,459
But she's kind-hearted.

436
00:24:13,459 --> 00:24:14,499
Trust me.

437
00:24:14,539 --> 00:24:16,259
Once you spend more time with her,

438
00:24:16,338 --> 00:24:17,699
you'll definitely come to like her.

439
00:24:19,739 --> 00:24:20,459
Also,

440
00:24:20,779 --> 00:24:23,499
your grandpa died
on the battlefield long ago.

441
00:24:24,338 --> 00:24:26,618
I've spent many years leading troops
away from home.

442
00:24:26,939 --> 00:24:29,019
In this home, it's just Mingzhu

443
00:24:29,019 --> 00:24:31,098
and Ting keeping
your grandma company.

444
00:24:31,578 --> 00:24:33,858
She cares for them both very much.

445
00:24:33,858 --> 00:24:35,699
I usually can't discipline
or scold them.

446
00:24:36,338 --> 00:24:37,338
However,

447
00:24:37,618 --> 00:24:39,059
they were indeed wrong today.

448
00:24:39,338 --> 00:24:40,418
I also acknowledge

449
00:24:41,098 --> 00:24:42,699
that I failed to teach them properly.

450
00:24:43,138 --> 00:24:43,939
So,

451
00:24:44,098 --> 00:24:46,699
let me apologize on their behalf.

452
00:24:46,939 --> 00:24:48,098
Please don't blame yourself.

453
00:24:50,979 --> 00:24:52,299
Actually, what Mingzhu

454
00:24:52,338 --> 00:24:53,378
and Ting said

455
00:24:53,699 --> 00:24:55,138
makes some sense.

456
00:24:55,658 --> 00:24:58,378
It's just that you allowed me
to do business

457
00:24:58,979 --> 00:25:00,618
because of your tolerance toward me,

458
00:25:01,098 --> 00:25:02,299
and I'm very grateful for that.

459
00:25:02,378 --> 00:25:03,418
There's no need to thank me.

460
00:25:04,259 --> 00:25:05,378
I'm your father.

461
00:25:05,658 --> 00:25:07,098
It's only natural to do so.

462
00:25:07,098 --> 00:25:08,138
Just do it.

463
00:25:08,658 --> 00:25:10,289
I'll talk to your grandma about it.

464
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:11,392
Don't worry about anything.

465
00:25:12,098 --> 00:25:14,338
Please don't argue
with Old Madam Wei again.

466
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:17,178
If it weren't for me today,

467
00:25:17,378 --> 00:25:18,858
there wouldn't be an imperial decree.

468
00:25:18,907 --> 00:25:19,707
Perhaps,

469
00:25:19,858 --> 00:25:21,378
everyone would be enjoying

470
00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:23,979
the New Year's Eve dinner together
right now.

471
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:25,098
I forbid you to speak

472
00:25:25,098 --> 00:25:26,338
as if you're an outsider.

473
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:28,259
Yining.

474
00:25:29,059 --> 00:25:30,739
It makes me really happy

475
00:25:31,024 --> 00:25:32,930
to have you celebrate
the New Year with me today.

476
00:25:33,939 --> 00:25:35,658
You're my daughter.

477
00:25:36,378 --> 00:25:37,178
In the future,

478
00:25:37,418 --> 00:25:39,699
you can do whatever you want.

479
00:25:40,299 --> 00:25:42,499
You don't have to care
about other people's opinions

480
00:25:43,019 --> 00:25:45,098
or what they feel.

481
00:25:46,178 --> 00:25:48,098
I just want you to be bold

482
00:25:48,098 --> 00:25:49,059
and do as you please.

483
00:25:49,578 --> 00:25:50,618
Even if the sky falls down,

484
00:25:50,818 --> 00:25:52,059
I will be there to support you.

485
00:25:57,898 --> 00:25:58,939
It's getting cold.

486
00:25:59,539 --> 00:26:01,299
You should get some rest early.

487
00:26:03,739 --> 00:26:04,898
Thank you, Father.

488
00:26:06,618 --> 00:26:07,138

There's no one else here.

00:26:59,939 --> 00:27:01,739
Be honest with me.

501
00:27:01,739 --> 00:27:03,618
Did you deliberately teach Ting

502
00:27:03,618 --> 00:27:05,098
to look down on Yining like that?

503
00:27:05,499 --> 00:27:06,299
Grandma,

504
00:27:06,779 --> 00:27:08,739
Yining is in the wrong.

505
00:27:08,858 --> 00:27:09,818
As the legitimate daughter

506
00:27:09,818 --> 00:27:10,818
of the Duke's family,

507
00:27:10,858 --> 00:27:12,178
she goes out to run a shop.

508
00:27:12,178 --> 00:27:14,578
Isn't she clearly bringing shame
to the family?

509
00:27:14,858 --> 00:27:15,658
You're unbelievable.

510
00:27:16,469 --> 00:27:18,629
I know you're doing it
for the family's interest.

511
00:27:18,699 --> 00:27:20,338
But how could you

512
00:27:20,338 --> 00:27:21,539
let Ting say that to her?

513
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:22,178
I...

514
00:27:23,219 --> 00:27:25,098
I admit that I told Ting about it.

515
00:27:25,378 --> 00:27:26,779
But I didn't expect

516
00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:28,658
he would say something like that.

517
00:27:29,138 --> 00:27:30,098
This matter

518
00:27:30,138 --> 00:27:32,699
has made your father furious.

519
00:27:32,699 --> 00:27:35,019
He feels we've wronged Yining.

520
00:27:35,123 --> 00:27:36,724
You need

521
00:27:36,779 --> 00:27:38,739
to change your temper

522
00:27:38,739 --> 00:27:41,418
and try to get closer to her.

523
00:27:42,338 --> 00:27:45,098
I understand.

524
00:27:45,939 --> 00:27:46,699
Come here.

525
00:27:49,178 --> 00:27:50,059
Sit here.

526
00:27:54,098 --> 00:27:55,259
I know

527
00:27:56,539 --> 00:27:58,338
it's hard for you

528
00:27:58,338 --> 00:28:00,418
to accept her right now.

529
00:28:00,418 --> 00:28:03,259
All this while,
you were the only girl here.

530
00:28:03,658 --> 00:28:05,219
Now, there's another one,

531
00:28:05,219 --> 00:28:06,618
and she's the legitimate child.

532
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:11,059
The way everyone around here treats you

533
00:28:11,219 --> 00:28:13,098
might make you uncomfortable.

534
00:28:13,539 --> 00:28:14,338
No, I wasn't.

535
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:15,939
Still denying, huh?

536
00:28:20,618 --> 00:28:22,539
There, there. Don't cry.

537
00:28:24,259 --> 00:28:25,618
Listen to me.

538
00:28:25,739 --> 00:28:27,939
Even if she's the legitimate child,

539
00:28:27,939 --> 00:28:29,539
she won't dare to pick on you.

540
00:28:30,499 --> 00:28:31,699
Yining wouldn't dare.

541
00:28:31,898 --> 00:28:33,818
Your father wouldn't dare, either.

542
00:28:36,378 --> 00:28:37,338
Grandma.

543
00:28:38,818 --> 00:28:39,979
Silly child.

544
00:28:42,338 --> 00:28:43,098
Mother.

545
00:28:44,939 --> 00:28:45,939
Where's Yining?

546
00:28:46,539 --> 00:28:47,338
She already left.

547
00:28:47,724 --> 00:28:49,484
What? She left?

548
00:28:49,818 --> 00:28:51,658
Is she throwing a tantrum?

549
00:28:51,898 --> 00:28:53,299
When she sees me after this,

550
00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:54,939
will she even stop calling
me Grandma

551
00:28:54,939 --> 00:28:56,858
and start calling me Old Madam Wei?

552
00:28:58,306 --> 00:28:59,106
Mingzhu,

553
00:28:59,219 --> 00:29:01,138
go and check on Ting.

554
00:29:13,618 --> 00:29:14,418
Mother.

555
00:29:15,299 --> 00:29:17,418
Yining returned to the Luo's Residence

556
00:29:17,418 --> 00:29:19,739
because she misses her grandma.

557
00:29:20,098 --> 00:29:23,098
Without Old Madam Luo's protection
over the years,

558
00:29:23,098 --> 00:29:24,098
Yining

559
00:29:24,138 --> 00:29:25,658
might have fallen victim
to wicked people

560
00:29:25,658 --> 00:29:26,898
and wouldn't be alive today.

561
00:29:28,739 --> 00:29:31,618
Yining has suffered too much
these years.

562
00:29:31,699 --> 00:29:33,338
She is my daughter.

563
00:29:33,418 --> 00:29:36,019
But she has never enjoyed
even one day of my care and love.

564
00:29:36,699 --> 00:29:38,338
I owe her so much.

565
00:29:38,699 --> 00:29:40,699
I know you feel indebted.

566
00:29:41,858 --> 00:29:42,858
But you shouldn't be

567
00:29:42,858 --> 00:29:44,418
too obvious in favoring her.

568
00:29:46,338 --> 00:29:47,178
I know

569
00:29:47,219 --> 00:29:48,939
you truly care for Mingzhu.

570
00:29:49,098 --> 00:29:50,019
I feel the same too.

571
00:29:50,299 --> 00:29:51,539
But look what happened today?

572
00:29:52,378 --> 00:29:54,418
When Mingzhu bullies Yining,

573
00:29:54,499 --> 00:29:56,019
you say nothing at all.

574
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,079
I've reprimanded her about this.

575
00:29:58,418 --> 00:30:00,138
She didn't do it on purpose.

576
00:30:00,499 --> 00:30:01,378
But

577
00:30:02,138 --> 00:30:04,779
you sent Mingzhu back

578
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:06,539
with the vases she gave Yining

579
00:30:06,539 --> 00:30:08,259
because you didn't like them.

580
00:30:10,539 --> 00:30:12,779
Mother, you should know

581
00:30:13,484 --> 00:30:14,496
how many rare treasures are

582
00:30:14,499 --> 00:30:15,739
in Mingzhu's room.

583
00:30:15,979 --> 00:30:18,459
But she chose the cheapest ones
for Yining.

584
00:30:18,539 --> 00:30:19,699
Isn't she clearly

585
00:30:19,899 --> 00:30:21,138
belittling Yining?

586
00:30:21,539 --> 00:30:22,539
Just so you know.

587
00:30:22,578 --> 00:30:23,939
I returned it to her directly

588
00:30:23,939 --> 00:30:25,299
out of respect for you.

589
00:30:25,378 --> 00:30:26,219
If it were my way,

590
00:30:26,219 --> 00:30:27,779
I would have smashed them right then.

591
00:30:29,178 --> 00:30:29,939
Also,

592
00:30:30,098 --> 00:30:32,818
I don't agree with you in making

593
00:30:33,104 --> 00:30:34,450
her close down Yanrong Pavilion.

594
00:30:34,818 --> 00:30:36,219
That is her hard work.

595
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,280
I'm looking out for her too.

596
00:30:39,578 --> 00:30:41,935
As the legitimate daughter of a Duke,

597
00:30:41,936 --> 00:30:44,250
who was conferred the title
of county princess by His Majesty,

598
00:30:44,378 --> 00:30:46,539
she must act appropriately.

599
00:30:46,779 --> 00:30:48,578
Going out to do business

600
00:30:48,578 --> 00:30:50,739
is not dignified for us.

601
00:30:50,818 --> 00:30:51,739
Back in the day,

602
00:30:52,098 --> 00:30:54,178
you served in the army as a woman.

603
00:30:54,618 --> 00:30:55,418
Didn't you face

604
00:30:55,699 --> 00:30:57,378
a lot of criticism then?

605
00:30:57,418 --> 00:30:58,818
But you endured it

606
00:30:58,818 --> 00:31:00,098
and achieved merit,

607
00:31:00,098 --> 00:31:01,418
raising our household's prestige.

608
00:31:01,418 --> 00:31:02,219
I know

609
00:31:02,299 --> 00:31:04,539
you've always had an open heart.

610
00:31:04,979 --> 00:31:06,138
But

611
00:31:06,259 --> 00:31:07,658
why can't you let go

612
00:31:08,138 --> 00:31:09,618
of this little matter with Yining now?

613
00:31:12,219 --> 00:31:13,699
You know this is not

614
00:31:13,699 --> 00:31:14,939
what I worried about.

615
00:31:15,019 --> 00:31:16,699
Then you needn't worry about it at all.

616
00:31:17,019 --> 00:31:19,259
I'll explain to His Majesty tomorrow.

617
00:31:19,338 --> 00:31:20,098
Is that all right?

618
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:26,528
(Chengjing Hall)

619
00:31:32,378 --> 00:31:33,178
Shenyuan.

620
00:31:33,699 --> 00:31:34,618
Are you planning

621
00:31:34,784 --> 00:31:36,650
to continue investigating
the Eighth Prince case?

622
00:31:37,779 --> 00:31:38,578
Father,

623
00:31:38,739 --> 00:31:40,858
I have already made plans
regarding this matter.

624
00:31:40,979 --> 00:31:43,059
So don't worry about it.

625
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:46,160
You've only been in your position
for a month,

626
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:47,728
and you've investigated so many people.

627
00:31:48,138 --> 00:31:49,699
The Imperial Court of Judicial

628
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:51,219
has quite a few opinions about you.

629
00:31:51,739 --> 00:31:54,019
When it comes to conducting oneself
and handling affairs,

630
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,721
the first priority should be stability.

631
00:31:57,138 --> 00:31:58,939
You have only started,

632
00:31:59,178 --> 00:32:00,499
but you've made numerous enemies.

633
00:32:00,818 --> 00:32:01,898
To be honest,

634
00:32:03,098 --> 00:32:04,658
Official Jiang is not very satisfied

635
00:32:05,219 --> 00:32:06,539
with you right now.

636
00:32:06,898 --> 00:32:07,459
I see.

637
00:32:08,338 --> 00:32:10,059
I understand your worries.

638
00:32:10,898 --> 00:32:12,818
But do you think this matter

639
00:32:12,939 --> 00:32:14,299
should not
be investigated further?

640
00:32:14,818 --> 00:32:15,618
Keep investigating.

641
00:32:16,138 --> 00:32:17,618
If you want to investigate, then do so.

642
00:32:18,098 --> 00:32:20,858
But I hope you can take it step by step.

643
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:23,138
The forces within the court

644
00:32:23,138 --> 00:32:24,739
are complicated.

645
00:32:25,043 --> 00:32:26,204
When you target someone,

646
00:32:26,299 --> 00:32:27,618
you don't even know

647
00:32:27,618 --> 00:32:29,098
which faction is backing them.

648
00:32:29,578 --> 00:32:31,858
The Eighth Prince's case
is far-reaching.

649
00:32:32,299 --> 00:32:34,699
Back then, the Eighth Prince went
to the south of Yangtze River

650
00:32:34,739 --> 00:32:36,939
for disaster relief with Chen Jiuheng.

651
00:32:37,539 --> 00:32:39,459
As a result, Chen Jiuheng embezzled

652
00:32:39,779 --> 00:32:41,138
the relief funds

653
00:32:42,259 --> 00:32:44,499
and the Eighth Prince went missing.

654
00:32:44,739 --> 00:32:45,898
There are rumors

655
00:32:46,098 --> 00:32:48,539
that Chen Jiuheng killed
the Eighth Prince

656
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,560
to cover up the facts.

657
00:32:51,299 --> 00:32:52,578
In the end,

658
00:32:52,768 --> 00:32:55,056
it led to the execution
of his entire family generation.

659
00:32:55,338 --> 00:32:56,098
Father,

660
00:32:57,219 --> 00:32:59,098
I don't think that was what happened.

661
00:32:59,712 --> 00:33:01,670
Official Chen couldn't
possibly embezzle funds.

662
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:04,578
Why are you so certain?

663
00:33:11,019 --> 00:33:11,818
Shenyuan,

664
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:14,418
I hope

665
00:33:14,699 --> 00:33:17,178
you don't let your arrogance drag

666
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:19,818
the entire Luo family down.

667
00:33:25,739 --> 00:33:26,818
I shall remember that.

668
00:33:27,056 --> 00:33:28,490
But I will definitely investigate

669
00:33:29,898 --> 00:33:31,299
this matter further.

670
00:33:34,176 --> 00:33:36,096
Why do we keep discussing
official business

671
00:33:36,176 --> 00:33:38,090
during the New Year?

672
00:33:38,098 --> 00:33:39,098
- Have some tea.
- Right.

673
00:33:39,098 --> 00:33:41,098
Have some snacks
and let's talk about something happy.

674
00:33:43,539 --> 00:33:44,378
Mother,

675
00:33:44,699 --> 00:33:47,418
Mr. Sun came over a few days ago.

676
00:33:47,699 --> 00:33:49,059
I talked to him

677
00:33:49,221 --> 00:33:51,820
about Shenyuan's engagement
to Young Lady Sun.

678
00:33:52,338 --> 00:33:53,699
Mr. Sun expressed his intention

679
00:33:53,939 --> 00:33:55,138
to respect his daughter

680
00:33:55,138 --> 00:33:56,618
and ask for her opinion.

681
00:33:56,618 --> 00:33:57,338
That sounds good.

682
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,960
This is indeed a good match.

683
00:34:00,644 --> 00:34:02,123
Shenyuan, what do you think?

684
00:34:02,338 --> 00:34:03,779
I have no feelings toward her.

685
00:34:04,578 --> 00:34:06,378
I think we can talk

686
00:34:07,299 --> 00:34:08,379
about this after two years.

687
00:34:13,859 --> 00:34:14,658
Grandma.

688
00:34:14,979 --> 00:34:16,258
Father. Mother.

689
00:34:17,298 --> 00:34:18,419
I have something to attend to.

690
00:34:18,539 --> 00:34:20,899
So I'll take my leave.

691
00:34:37,091 --> 00:34:39,004
(Yanrong Pavilion)

692
00:34:40,738 --> 00:34:41,419
Young Master,

693
00:34:41,552 --> 00:34:43,490
Young Lady Yining should be having
a reunion dinner

694
00:34:43,499 --> 00:34:44,578
at Duke Ying's Residence.

695
00:34:44,592 --> 00:34:46,560
You won't be able to see her even
if you come here.

696
00:34:48,218 --> 00:34:50,819
Not being able to see her is good news.

697
00:34:51,611 --> 00:34:53,211
It means everything
is going well for her

698
00:34:53,456 --> 00:34:54,720
at the Duke Ying's Residence.

699
00:34:57,104 --> 00:34:59,152
It would be great
if you could marry her sooner.

700
00:34:59,344 --> 00:35:01,250
So you wouldn't have to think
about her every day.

701
00:35:24,064 --> 00:35:25,570
This year's Spring Festival couplets

702
00:35:25,698 --> 00:35:27,138
were written by Third Brother.

703
00:35:28,098 --> 00:35:29,819
With a top scholar in the residence,

704
00:35:29,819 --> 00:35:31,218
it's only natural to show it off.

705
00:35:35,899 --> 00:35:38,218
I supposed Grandma, Third Brother,

706
00:35:38,499 --> 00:35:39,658
and Mother are having

707
00:35:40,258 --> 00:35:42,178
the New Year's Eve dinner, right?

708
00:35:43,298 --> 00:35:45,379
Young Lady, should we go in?

709
00:35:49,379 --> 00:35:50,819
Let's head to Yanrong Pavilion.

710
00:35:52,059 --> 00:35:53,178
Yes, Young Lady.

711

712
00:36:21,939 --> 00:36:22,738
What's wrong?

713
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:25,440
It has only been a few days,
and you don't recognize me anymore.

714
00:36:25,778 --> 00:36:27,059
Why are you here?

715
00:36:27,298 --> 00:36:28,339
It's already late.

716
00:36:28,339 --> 00:36:30,859
I thought you were celebrating
the New Year at Luo's Residence.

717
00:36:30,859 --> 00:36:31,578
What about you?

718
00:36:32,178 --> 00:36:34,218
Did you not like the dinner
at Duke Ying's Residence?

719
00:36:36,218 --> 00:36:37,019
Third Brother.

720
00:36:45,859 --> 00:36:47,059
I missed you.

721
00:36:48,138 --> 00:36:48,899

Not too long.

725
00:37:05,218 --> 00:37:06,419
But if I hadn't come back,

726
00:37:06,419 --> 00:37:07,698
wouldn't you have waited

only to give me this?

730
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:18,416
Also, to celebrate
the New Year's Eve with you.

731
00:37:18,899 --> 00:37:19,698
Why does this look

Can't you tell

734
00:37:23,819 --> 00:37:25,658
it's something I made myself?

735
00:37:25,859 --> 00:37:27,178
You're being too picky.

736
00:37:28,178 --> 00:37:29,178
You made this yourself?

Third Brother, look at how lively

739
00:37:34,979 --> 00:37:36,129
they are setting off fireworks.

740
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:37,632
I want to go set off fireworks too.

The county princess

757
00:39:05,459 --> 00:39:07,218
must have brought over all the fireworks

758
00:39:07,499 --> 00:39:08,578
from Duke Ying's Residence!

759
00:39:09,778 --> 00:39:11,298
You already know

760
00:39:11,618 --> 00:39:12,939
I've been titled as county princess.

761
00:39:16,576 --> 00:39:18,330
It's just that Old Madam Wei told me

762
00:39:18,738 --> 00:39:20,698
that I'm now a person of rank

763
00:39:20,939 --> 00:39:22,698
and can't be in public openly.

764
00:39:23,258 --> 00:39:25,138
She wanted me to close Yanrong Pavilion.

765
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,680
Officials engaging in business

766
00:39:30,138 --> 00:39:32,059
is quite normal.

767
00:39:33,298 --> 00:39:35,859
But in recent years, there have been
several major cases

768
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:37,664
of collusion
between officials and businesses,

769
00:39:38,128 --> 00:39:40,110
which led His Majesty to issue
an order prohibiting officials

770
00:39:40,110 --> 00:39:41,990
from profiting at the expense
of the common people.

771
00:39:42,032 --> 00:39:43,632
A small business like Yanrong Pavilion

772
00:39:43,808 --> 00:39:45,770
certainly doesn't count
as profiting from the people.

773
00:39:46,499 --> 00:39:48,459
Besides, you're not
the sole owner of the shop.

774
00:39:49,098 --> 00:39:51,178
Duke Ying will convince
Old Madam Wei about this.

775
00:39:51,539 --> 00:39:52,979
So you can rest assured.

776
00:39:53,298 --> 00:39:54,098
But

777
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,048
I don't want to put Father
in a difficult position.

778
00:39:59,152 --> 00:40:00,784
Have you acknowledged him
as your father?

779
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:02,698
Today,

780
00:40:02,859 --> 00:40:04,578
I tried calling him "Father."

781
00:40:04,979 --> 00:40:06,578
It wasn't that hard.

782
00:40:06,578 --> 00:40:08,578
I originally thought

783
00:40:08,618 --> 00:40:10,539
that "Father" was just a cold term.

784
00:40:11,539 --> 00:40:13,138
But now I find it

785
00:40:14,059 --> 00:40:14,979
quite warm.

786
00:40:16,939 --> 00:40:18,339
Since you acknowledged him,

787
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,210
are you considering moving back home?

788
00:40:23,019 --> 00:40:24,218
Do you think

789
00:40:24,899 --> 00:40:26,459
I should move back there?

790
00:40:28,218 --> 00:40:29,698
They're your family, after all.

791
00:40:33,218 --> 00:40:34,539
But aside from my father,

792
00:40:34,738 --> 00:40:35,738
everyone else

793
00:40:36,379 --> 00:40:38,138
feels like strangers to me.

794
00:40:41,578 --> 00:40:42,379
Plus,

795
00:40:43,138 --> 00:40:44,979
I can't return to Luo's Residence.

796
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:48,298
I no longer have a home.

797
00:40:58,859 --> 00:40:59,658
Yining.

798
00:41:02,138 --> 00:41:03,298
If you're willing,

799
00:41:04,618 --> 00:41:05,859
I can give you a home.

800
00:41:09,339 --> 00:41:10,218
Actually, I have...

801
00:41:10,899 --> 00:41:11,618
I have long...

802
00:41:11,618 --> 00:41:12,379
Third Brother.

804
00:41:17,618 --> 00:41:19,778

809
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:53,019
Uncle,

810
00:41:53,379 --> 00:41:55,698
Luo Shenyuan has already found
the remains of Eighth Prince.

811
00:41:55,899 --> 00:41:57,138
His remains were found

812
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,690
at the Tiger Head Gang's former base

813
00:41:59,379 --> 00:42:00,218
in Mount Laohu.

814
00:42:00,304 --> 00:42:02,090
Back then,
Wang Yuan sent his trusted confidant,

815
00:42:02,107 --> 00:42:03,627
Gao Da, to handle this matter.

816
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:06,339
But look at how poorly it turned out.

817
00:42:06,859 --> 00:42:08,339
Had I known Gao Da would handle things

818
00:42:08,339 --> 00:42:09,459
so inefficiently,

819
00:42:09,536 --> 00:42:11,840
I wouldn't have gotten involved
in this messy situation.

820
00:42:12,059 --> 00:42:13,819
Since Luo Shenyuan has traced this lead,

821
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:17,339
Chancellor Wang would be making
his move right?

822
00:42:17,578 --> 00:42:19,539
We'll sit back
and let them fight it out.

823
00:42:19,738 --> 00:42:20,939
We'll see how things turn out.

824
00:42:26,719 --> 00:42:28,500
(Yanrong Pavilion)

825
00:42:35,936 --> 00:42:37,776
The servant
of Duke Ying's Residence said

826
00:42:38,096 --> 00:42:40,272
that Young Lady Yining had returned
to Yanrong Pavilion.

827
00:42:40,618 --> 00:42:42,218
Should we go and visit?

828
00:42:42,899 --> 00:42:44,258
Instead of staying at Duke's residence

829
00:42:44,258 --> 00:42:46,178
during the New Year, she came here.

830
00:42:46,658 --> 00:42:48,778
It seems she isn't happy
at Duke Ying's Residence.

831
00:42:50,819 --> 00:42:52,698
Duke Ying keeps saying

832
00:42:52,698 --> 00:42:54,138
how much he spoils his daughter.

833
00:42:55,339 --> 00:42:56,618
But is this how he spoils her?

834
00:42:56,899 --> 00:42:57,698
Uncle,

835
00:42:57,698 --> 00:42:59,419
this is the time you should appear.

836
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:01,019
When a woman feels vulnerable,

837
00:43:01,419 --> 00:43:02,899
a man's care shows...

838
00:43:02,899 --> 00:43:04,499
Don't use what you learned

839
00:43:04,499 --> 00:43:05,658
from those brothels on her.

840
00:43:06,698 --> 00:43:07,778
I just feel

841
00:43:08,218 --> 00:43:09,778
that you went to great lengths

842
00:43:09,778 --> 00:43:11,500
to bring Song Ziyun over
to explain the truth

843
00:43:11,539 --> 00:43:12,698
and to secure her title

844
00:43:12,698 --> 00:43:13,859
as County Princess.

845
00:43:14,298 --> 00:43:15,859
She should be touched.

846
00:43:16,258 --> 00:43:17,379
As for me,

847
00:43:17,392 --> 00:43:19,424
I've been waiting for her
for so many years.

848
00:43:19,618 --> 00:43:21,138
I'm not afraid of the passing of time.

849
00:43:23,698 --> 00:43:25,019
I believe that one day

850
00:43:26,499 --> 00:43:28,138
she will change her mind.

851
00:43:32,859 --> 00:43:33,979
You should head back quickly.

852
00:43:34,459 --> 00:43:35,459
It's the New Year's.

853
00:43:35,578 --> 00:43:36,698
