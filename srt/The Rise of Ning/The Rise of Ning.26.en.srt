Training Handbook" from Jinjiang Literature)

=Episode 26=

4
00:01:40,127 --> 00:01:41,599
The girl is in a state of shock.

5
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,839
You should stop forcing her.

6
00:01:43,158 --> 00:01:44,917
I'm doing this for her own good.

7
00:01:45,678 --> 00:01:47,438
Xiu's future will be ruined

8
00:01:47,576 --> 00:01:49,695
if we don't resolve this soon.

9
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,637
There are other solutions to this.

10
00:01:53,357 --> 00:01:54,598
Let's give it some thought.

11
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:57,312
We shouldn't rush to discuss
the marriage proposal with Her Highness.

12
00:01:58,277 --> 00:01:59,078
I'm afraid

13
00:01:59,477 --> 00:02:01,318
there's no other solution to this.

14
00:02:01,328 --> 00:02:03,350
Establishing a marital alliance
is the best solution.

15
00:02:03,718 --> 00:02:04,477
First Master,

16
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:06,576
you spend most of your time
away from home.

17
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,080
I've been managing the family
all this while.

18
00:02:09,278 --> 00:02:10,278
Regarding this matter,

19
00:02:10,838 --> 00:02:12,357
it's better for you to heed my will.

20
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:13,197
You...

21
00:02:18,598 --> 00:02:19,237
Greetings,

22
00:02:19,237 --> 00:02:21,118
Uncle, Aunt.

23
00:02:22,736 --> 00:02:24,976
Grandma has always been
concerned about Sixth Sister.

24
00:02:25,118 --> 00:02:27,558
She sent me here to check on her.

25
00:02:28,318 --> 00:02:29,757
Yining, great timing.

26
00:02:30,237 --> 00:02:31,558
You should have a chat with her.

27
00:02:35,118 --> 00:02:35,957
Sixth Sister,

28
00:02:36,118 --> 00:02:36,878
do you feel better?

29
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:39,957
Lan, we should let the children talk.

30
00:02:39,957 --> 00:02:40,757
Let's leave the room.

31
00:02:43,718 --> 00:02:45,438
Since Mother has already found out,

32
00:02:45,438 --> 00:02:47,477
we should at least
hear about her opinion.

33
00:02:47,757 --> 00:02:48,558
Let's go.

34
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,476
Yining, what should I do?

35
00:02:59,477 --> 00:03:01,118
I don't wish to be married to Han Zhao.

36
00:03:02,677 --> 00:03:04,038
Don't be upset.

37
00:03:04,158 --> 00:03:05,878
I'll think of a solution
together with you.

38
00:03:06,357 --> 00:03:08,878
It has already come to this.
What other solution is there?

39
00:03:10,998 --> 00:03:11,677
Lian Hong.

40
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:16,278
Send all the maids outside away.

41
00:03:16,368 --> 00:03:17,110
Yes, Young Lady.

42
00:03:33,357 --> 00:03:35,118
Old Madam wishes to try
the snacks we make.

43
00:03:35,118 --> 00:03:36,838
- You two, come with me.
- Yes.

44
00:03:48,077 --> 00:03:48,637
Is she around?

45
00:04:00,158 --> 00:04:01,118
Are you okay?

46
00:04:01,558 --> 00:04:03,438
Mother wants me
to get married to Han Zhao.

47
00:04:03,797 --> 00:04:05,278
I don't wish to be married to him.

48
00:04:05,888 --> 00:04:06,950
You don't need to, then.

49
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:09,878
I'll take you away.

50
00:04:11,278 --> 00:04:12,558
You'll take me away?

51
00:04:12,917 --> 00:04:14,917
Although I'm not a nobleman of any sort,

52
00:04:15,237 --> 00:04:16,598
I'll work hard to make enough money

53
00:04:16,624 --> 00:04:18,432
so that we can eat
at Liuhe Tavern every day.

54
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,270
How could anyone eat
at Liuhe Tavern every day?

55
00:04:20,270 --> 00:04:21,680
I'll gain a lot of weight, you know?

56
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:27,870
I found out
that you fell into the water.

57
00:04:27,984 --> 00:04:29,248
I brought some medicine for you.

58
00:04:33,158 --> 00:04:33,638
Let's go.

59
00:04:36,278 --> 00:04:37,117
Sixth Uncle,

60
00:04:37,437 --> 00:04:38,357
do you truly intend

61
00:04:38,357 --> 00:04:39,917
to take Sixth Sister away
just like that?

62
00:04:39,952 --> 00:04:41,696
Have you ever considered
the consequences?

63
00:04:41,797 --> 00:04:42,598
After this,

64
00:04:42,677 --> 00:04:44,278
the Luo Family and the Lin Family

65
00:04:44,278 --> 00:04:45,477
will become enemies.

66
00:04:46,078 --> 00:04:47,038
If so, how should Mother

67
00:04:47,158 --> 00:04:49,078
spend her days in the Luo's Residence?

68
00:04:51,184 --> 00:04:53,310
I've already told Qing Qu
to investigate the case.

69
00:04:53,797 --> 00:04:54,638
That boat

70
00:04:55,117 --> 00:04:56,629
was indeed tampered with.

71
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,920
Who was trying to harm me, then?

72
00:05:19,237 --> 00:05:20,117
So,

73
00:05:20,797 --> 00:05:22,917
my mother resorted to letting me
fall into the water

74
00:05:23,411 --> 00:05:24,812
so I could marry into Han Zhao?

75
00:05:25,797 --> 00:05:26,838
This case

76
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,357
hasn't been concluded yet.

77
00:05:30,117 --> 00:05:30,958
Sixth Sister,

78
00:05:31,877 --> 00:05:32,958
your priority

79
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,598
is to rest and recuperate.

80
00:05:35,038 --> 00:05:35,838
Come.

81
00:05:36,768 --> 00:05:38,430
Regarding Young Master Han
and the marriage,

82
00:05:38,464 --> 00:05:39,904
I'll think of a solution for you.

83
00:05:40,357 --> 00:05:41,677
Yining is right.

84
00:05:41,728 --> 00:05:42,669
You should take medicine.

85
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:44,768
We can come up with a solution
after you've recovered.

86
00:05:46,272 --> 00:05:47,910
Are you sure you want to
take me with you?

87
00:05:51,158 --> 00:05:52,437
I'm a man.

88
00:05:52,598 --> 00:05:53,477
I always keep my word.

89
00:05:53,877 --> 00:05:56,557
But the incident with Young Master Han
has already occurred.

90
00:05:56,557 --> 00:05:57,838
How should we resolve this issue?

91
00:05:58,158 --> 00:05:59,158
I'll go and find Han Zhao.

92
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,598
If he doesn't reject the marriage,

93
00:06:01,630 --> 00:06:02,848
I'll fight him to the death.

94
00:06:04,917 --> 00:06:06,437
His mother is the princess.

95
00:06:06,557 --> 00:06:07,958
He'll be afraid of your resolution?

96
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:10,437
The bigger the fuss
you make over this matter,

97
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,336
the less room there will be
for maneuvering.

98
00:06:15,728 --> 00:06:16,609
Yining,

99
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,070
you're the smartest girl I know.

100
00:06:18,096 --> 00:06:19,344
Do you have any solutions?

101
00:06:22,917 --> 00:06:24,357
Regarding Yixiu's marriage,

102
00:06:24,838 --> 00:06:26,838
have you two given any thoughts to it?

103
00:06:27,958 --> 00:06:28,797
Mother,

104
00:06:30,117 --> 00:06:32,677
I wish to head
to the Princess's Residence

105
00:06:32,719 --> 00:06:34,039
to discuss the marital alliance.

106
00:06:35,635 --> 00:06:38,716
This is indeed an excellent marriage.

107
00:06:38,752 --> 00:06:40,950
If we do establish a marital alliance
with Her Highness,

108
00:06:41,198 --> 00:06:44,677
we'll be claiming ties
with the imperial family.

109
00:06:45,477 --> 00:06:46,677
Mother, you're right.

110
00:06:47,078 --> 00:06:47,877
However,

111
00:06:48,117 --> 00:06:50,598
perhaps this is
Yixiu's blessing as well.

112
00:06:54,124 --> 00:06:55,644
If Yixiu

113
00:06:55,983 --> 00:06:57,703
isn't willing
to marry into their family,

114
00:06:58,317 --> 00:07:00,758
I suppose there's no need to force her.

115
00:07:01,158 --> 00:07:02,917
I've already lived until this age.

116
00:07:02,917 --> 00:07:05,518
I've come to understand a lot of things.

117
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:08,463
Although it's honorable
to marry into a dignified family,

118
00:07:08,838 --> 00:07:11,677
there are certain things
that cannot be forced.

119
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:13,792
The child

120
00:07:14,038 --> 00:07:15,357
can find a reliable man

121
00:07:15,638 --> 00:07:17,078
whom she likes.

122
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:19,557
It's good enough for her
to be content and happy.

123
00:07:20,758 --> 00:07:22,437
Mother, I understand what you mean.

124
00:07:23,038 --> 00:07:23,838
However,

125
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:26,117
in order to preserve Yixiu's reputation,

126
00:07:26,357 --> 00:07:29,958
I still wish to discuss the marital
alliance with Her Highness later.

127
00:07:32,078 --> 00:07:33,437
Mother has already made it obvious.

128
00:07:33,437 --> 00:07:34,958
Why are you still being stubborn?

129
00:07:41,838 --> 00:07:42,638
Mother,

130
00:07:44,117 --> 00:07:46,278
I shall take my leave first.

131
00:07:55,117 --> 00:07:56,317
It's all my fault.

132
00:07:56,838 --> 00:07:57,958
Initially,

133
00:07:58,078 --> 00:07:59,758
I thought the two children

134
00:07:59,917 --> 00:08:01,838
could enjoy their time together.

135
00:08:02,015 --> 00:08:04,015
Who would've expected
that incident to occur?

136
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,761
Young Master Han was anxious.

137
00:08:06,762 --> 00:08:07,882
He did it to rescue her.

138
00:08:08,278 --> 00:08:09,758
What he did was understandable.

139
00:08:10,703 --> 00:08:12,822
Madam Chen, you should
stop speaking up for him.

140
00:08:13,278 --> 00:08:15,158
All of us know how important

141
00:08:15,158 --> 00:08:16,638
a lady's reputation is to her.

142
00:08:16,917 --> 00:08:18,357
Your Highness, you're right.

143
00:08:18,677 --> 00:08:19,437
Luckily,

144
00:08:20,038 --> 00:08:22,317
both of the children are safe.

145
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,040
However, since this news has gotten out,

146
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:26,445
everyone knew

147
00:08:26,477 --> 00:08:29,357
that Young Master Han had rescued Sixth Lady.

148
00:08:29,758 --> 00:08:31,239
He saved her life

149
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,879
with such intimate actions.

150
00:08:38,272 --> 00:08:40,370
Madam Chen, I think
you misunderstood something.

151
00:08:40,917 --> 00:08:42,957
I wasn't the one who rescued

152
00:08:43,118 --> 00:08:43,917
Sixth Lady.

153
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,319
What?

154
00:08:51,238 --> 00:08:52,358
Young Master Han,

155
00:08:52,677 --> 00:08:53,797
what do you mean by that?

156
00:08:56,038 --> 00:08:58,478
I wasn't the one who saved Sixth Lady.

157
00:08:58,478 --> 00:08:59,478
It was Young Master Lin.

158
00:08:59,478 --> 00:09:01,118
Young Master Lin rescued me as well.

159
00:09:01,878 --> 00:09:04,437
I also wish to give Lin
and Sixth Lady my blessings.

160
00:09:04,638 --> 00:09:05,797
But since it has come to this,

161
00:09:05,968 --> 00:09:07,310
I can't change anything about it.

162
00:09:08,437 --> 00:09:10,269
You're Her Highness's eldest son.

163
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:12,470
If you said they didn't rescue them,
people will believe you.

164
00:09:12,478 --> 00:09:14,038
Nobody else can do anything
to you either.

165
00:09:15,728 --> 00:09:17,150
Besides, you're helping others.

166
00:09:17,358 --> 00:09:19,557
It's fine to tell a white lie sometimes.

167
00:09:21,317 --> 00:09:22,118
But...

168
00:09:22,957 --> 00:09:23,758
Han,

169
00:09:23,957 --> 00:09:26,278
I, Lin Mao, will remember
your kindness forever.

170
00:09:26,278 --> 00:09:27,557
If you need anything in the future,

171
00:09:27,557 --> 00:09:29,677
I will be at your service
without hesitation.

172
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:31,158
Young Master Han,

173
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:32,758
I snuck out

174
00:09:32,758 --> 00:09:34,557
to request a favor from you.

175
00:09:34,878 --> 00:09:36,077
Please help us out.

176
00:09:37,837 --> 00:09:39,358
You two don't need to resort to this.

177
00:09:46,317 --> 00:09:48,478
Fine. I'll deny the fact.

178
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,600
How is that possible?

179
00:09:59,038 --> 00:09:59,837
Back then,

180
00:09:59,957 --> 00:10:02,077
Sixth Lady was on the boat with you.

181
00:10:02,238 --> 00:10:03,957
Lin Mao wasn't there at all.

182
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,278
And,

183
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:06,880
everyone saw

184
00:10:07,358 --> 00:10:10,278
Young Master Han carrying Sixth Lady
to the shore.

185
00:10:10,358 --> 00:10:12,038
Maybe they were mistaken.

186
00:10:12,118 --> 00:10:14,597
Young Master Lin was the one
who rescued Sixth Lady.

187
00:10:14,758 --> 00:10:15,638
That's right.

188
00:10:15,758 --> 00:10:17,957
It was Young Master Lin

189
00:10:17,957 --> 00:10:19,758
who rescued Young Master and Sixth Lady.

190
00:10:20,118 --> 00:10:21,038
That's right, Mother.

191
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:22,478
Lin Mao did rescue me.

192
00:10:26,536 --> 00:10:29,016
Since Sixth Lady said so herself,

193
00:10:29,822 --> 00:10:32,062
seems like this is a misunderstanding.

194
00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:36,570
It's my fault, then.

195
00:10:37,568 --> 00:10:39,040
I was misled by other people's words.

196
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,080
Your Highness, sorry for bothering you.

197
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,161
Please pardon me.

198
00:10:44,437 --> 00:10:46,597
It's fine as long as we're clear now.

199
00:10:46,878 --> 00:10:47,797
If so, Madam Chen,

200
00:10:48,038 --> 00:10:50,077
I won't keep you for tea, then.

201
00:10:51,312 --> 00:10:52,910
Your Highness, you're too courteous.

202
00:10:54,151 --> 00:10:55,630
I shall take my leave first.

203
00:11:05,933 --> 00:11:06,773
Come here.

204
00:11:12,118 --> 00:11:14,118
Now, I can't even fathom

205
00:11:14,118 --> 00:11:16,278
my son's thoughts.

206
00:11:17,437 --> 00:11:18,238
Mother,

207
00:11:18,837 --> 00:11:21,278
since she doesn't like me,
there's no need to force her.

208
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,790
And I'm happy
that I get to help them

209
00:11:22,797 --> 00:11:24,118
become a couple.

210
00:11:28,158 --> 00:11:29,758
My son is considerate indeed.

211
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,201
One day,

212
00:11:31,437 --> 00:11:33,717
you have to find someone
who treats you sincerely.

213
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,408
Only then
will I be able to rest at ease.

214
00:11:35,998 --> 00:11:36,797
I will.

215
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,440
(Luo's Residence)

216
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,400
(Caifu Abode)

217
00:12:12,118 --> 00:12:14,158
Lan, why are you
visiting Caifu Abode today?

218
00:12:14,158 --> 00:12:15,437
You're a rare guest.

219
00:12:15,557 --> 00:12:17,638
You and your brother are something else.

220
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,168
You two even persuaded Young Master Han

221
00:12:19,184 --> 00:12:20,270
to lie together with you two.

222
00:12:20,358 --> 00:12:21,677
Do you think I'll let Xiu marry

223
00:12:21,797 --> 00:12:24,077
into the Lin Family just like this?

224
00:12:24,077 --> 00:12:25,278
In your dreams!

225
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:26,677
Lan.

226
00:12:27,437 --> 00:12:28,878
Let's talk this over.

227
00:12:29,238 --> 00:12:30,878
You should confront Her Highness

228
00:12:30,878 --> 00:12:32,717
if Young Master Han lied to you.

229
00:12:32,742 --> 00:12:33,943
What are you doing here instead?

230
00:12:33,998 --> 00:12:35,118
You came to the wrong place.

231
00:12:35,278 --> 00:12:36,478
Mother, let's head back.

232
00:12:36,478 --> 00:12:38,358
- You useless girl!
- Yixiu!

233
00:12:39,118 --> 00:12:39,797
Are you okay?

234
00:12:44,717 --> 00:12:46,758
Your worthless merchant family

235
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:48,917
tried their best

236
00:12:49,677 --> 00:12:51,478
to claim ties with
an official family like ours

237
00:12:51,478 --> 00:12:53,957
by marrying their daughter
into our residence as the second wife.

238
00:12:54,118 --> 00:12:56,317
And now, you intend
to marry my daughter?

239
00:12:56,677 --> 00:12:58,957
You guys are quite delusional, huh?

240
00:12:58,957 --> 00:13:00,758
This has nothing to do with my sister.

241
00:13:00,758 --> 00:13:01,957
Why criticize her?

242
00:13:01,957 --> 00:13:03,118
Criticize me if you must.

243
00:13:03,317 --> 00:13:05,077
Birds of a feather flock together!

244
00:13:07,677 --> 00:13:08,437
Lan,

245
00:13:08,758 --> 00:13:10,557
before I married into the Luo Family,

246
00:13:11,478 --> 00:13:14,077
Old Madam visited my family
and gave us plenty of dowries

247
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:17,439
before I agreed to it.

248
00:13:17,917 --> 00:13:20,317
Madam Chen, you always acted like

249
00:13:20,317 --> 00:13:22,238
a noble lady.

250
00:13:22,638 --> 00:13:24,957
Why are you disregarding your identity

251
00:13:25,278 --> 00:13:27,158
and telling us off as if you're a shrew?

252
00:13:28,597 --> 00:13:30,118
It's all because you and your brother

253
00:13:30,118 --> 00:13:31,597
are too malicious.

254
00:13:31,957 --> 00:13:34,069
Lin Hairu, I warned you before.

255
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:35,824
I told you to stay away
from my daughter.

256
00:13:36,038 --> 00:13:37,118
But now,

257
00:13:37,158 --> 00:13:38,957
you two are joining hands

258
00:13:39,038 --> 00:13:40,677
to ruin my daughter's marriage!

259
00:13:40,957 --> 00:13:41,837
Aunt.

260
00:13:43,917 --> 00:13:45,317
Why don't we ask this boatman

261
00:13:46,278 --> 00:13:48,118
how Sixth Sister
managed to fall into the water?

262
00:13:51,278 --> 00:13:52,077
Madam Lin.

263
00:13:52,278 --> 00:13:53,478
The boat you rented

264
00:13:53,557 --> 00:13:54,957
was repaired by me before this.

265
00:13:55,118 --> 00:13:56,957
The keel on one side
of the ship is damaged.

266
00:13:56,957 --> 00:13:58,158
I haven't managed to fix it yet.

267
00:13:58,316 --> 00:13:59,278
The boat might flip

268
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:00,464
if it's used inappropriately.

269
00:14:00,677 --> 00:14:02,358
But the one who rented the boat

270
00:14:02,358 --> 00:14:03,917
said it didn't matter.

271
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:05,158
I have nothing to do

272
00:14:05,437 --> 00:14:07,038
with the incident.

273
00:14:08,717 --> 00:14:09,597
Look at you.

274
00:14:10,118 --> 00:14:11,957
You brought this upon yourself.

275
00:14:12,256 --> 00:14:14,110
In order to claim ties
with the imperial family,

276
00:14:14,557 --> 00:14:17,358
you're even disregarding
your daughter's life.

277
00:14:17,358 --> 00:14:18,278
Nonsense!

278
00:14:19,478 --> 00:14:20,278
Nonsense!

279
00:14:22,797 --> 00:14:25,278
Where did you guys manage
to hire this scammer?

280
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:27,557
He's maligning me!

281
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,880
What are you saying?

282
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,200
I've been in this industry
for over a decade.

283
00:14:31,248 --> 00:14:32,710
Everyone in the industry knows who I am.

284
00:14:32,797 --> 00:14:34,269
And, I'm not the only one

285
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:35,552
who knew that the boat was faulty.

286
00:14:35,568 --> 00:14:37,240
I'll say the same thing
even if Her Highness

287
00:14:37,264 --> 00:14:38,464
sent her men to interrogate me.

288
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:41,038
All right. Thank you for coming.

289
00:14:41,837 --> 00:14:42,677
You may leave first.

290
00:14:48,118 --> 00:14:48,957
Aunt,

291
00:14:49,158 --> 00:14:51,238
don't you think you're too impatient

292
00:14:51,408 --> 00:14:53,270
in pushing Sixth Sister
to the imperial family?

293
00:14:53,478 --> 00:14:54,957
The person who rented the boat

294
00:14:55,077 --> 00:14:56,158
was far too careless.

295
00:14:57,158 --> 00:14:59,278
Her Highness was raised
in the palace since young.

296
00:14:59,456 --> 00:15:01,430
I'm sure she has seen
all kinds of plots and schemes.

297
00:15:01,437 --> 00:15:02,469
If, one day,

298
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:04,272
Her Highness does trace
the case back to you,

299
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:05,590
the entire Luo's Residence

300
00:15:05,957 --> 00:15:07,478
won't be able to live in peace.

301
00:15:25,118 --> 00:15:26,317
The person who rented the boat

302
00:15:27,358 --> 00:15:28,957
did do a terrible job at it.

303
00:15:29,717 --> 00:15:30,878
I'll definitely punish him.

304
00:15:31,717 --> 00:15:33,717
But I'll warn you guys again.

305
00:15:35,077 --> 00:15:36,917
Stop pestering my daughter.

306
00:15:36,917 --> 00:15:38,638
If not, I'll show you no mercy.

307
00:15:47,797 --> 00:15:48,638
Lin Mao,

308
00:15:49,758 --> 00:15:51,278
you want to marry my daughter?

309
00:15:51,726 --> 00:15:53,047
Over my dead body!

310
00:15:59,637 --> 00:16:00,397
Let's go.

311
00:16:09,223 --> 00:16:10,782
You useless fool!

312
00:16:11,038 --> 00:16:12,437
You should've drowned back then!

313
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:14,278
You'll drive me to my grave anyway!

314
00:16:14,317 --> 00:16:15,118
Mother!

315
00:16:15,184 --> 00:16:16,350
Mother, please be appeased!

316
00:16:16,512 --> 00:16:18,110
Yixiu has just recovered
from her illness.

317
00:16:18,118 --> 00:16:20,158
Mother, you shouldn't
get too agitated over this.

318
00:16:20,224 --> 00:16:22,544
How dare you join hands
with other people to deceive me?

319
00:16:22,597 --> 00:16:24,789
You're ruining your own future,
you know?

320
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:26,957
Mother, you're just afraid
that I might ruin your future

321
00:16:26,957 --> 00:16:28,358
and Shan's future, right?

322
00:16:28,358 --> 00:16:29,038
You!

323
00:16:29,677 --> 00:16:31,917
You spent too much time
with that lass, Luo Yining.

324
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:33,278
Now, you can talk back to me, huh?

325
00:16:33,278 --> 00:16:35,038
Stop it already. Apologize to Mother.

326
00:16:35,056 --> 00:16:36,480
I'm right! Why should I apologize?

327
00:16:36,797 --> 00:16:37,158
You!

328
00:16:38,557 --> 00:16:39,077
This is...

329
00:16:40,278 --> 00:16:41,677
Mother, have a seat.

330
00:16:42,358 --> 00:16:43,158
Are you okay?

331
00:16:44,478 --> 00:16:45,717
That was infuriating.

332
00:16:49,118 --> 00:16:51,278
Young Lady, that's too much.

333
00:16:51,797 --> 00:16:53,478
Why don't we get a bigger box?

334
00:16:54,238 --> 00:16:55,557
This is already the biggest box.

335
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:57,317
Young Lady!

336
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,290
Young lady, we're in trouble.

337
00:17:00,358 --> 00:17:01,118
What's wrong?

338
00:17:01,238 --> 00:17:02,957
Someone had written
a letter to our residence.

339
00:17:02,957 --> 00:17:04,077
They said Mistress Qiao had fallen

340
00:17:04,077 --> 00:17:05,238
seriously ill at the side yard.

341
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:07,488
Seems like she was too agitated
upon hearing

342
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:08,797
that Luo Xuanyuan failed the exam.

343
00:17:08,797 --> 00:17:10,597
Luo Xuanyuan was her only hope.

344
00:17:12,288 --> 00:17:14,590
Grandma will go into the mountains
to pay respect to Buddha.

345
00:17:14,656 --> 00:17:16,910
Once both Grandma
and Third Brother leave the residence,

346
00:17:16,918 --> 00:17:18,678
I'll visit the side yard myself.

347
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,941
(Luo's Residence)

348
00:17:30,038 --> 00:17:31,758
You must take care
of yourself out there.

349
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:34,077
If you need anything,
tell Shao'an to write to us.

350
00:17:34,128 --> 00:17:36,848
Since all of us are in the capital,
it's convenient to send it to you.

351
00:17:37,117 --> 00:17:38,317
Understood, Mother.

352
00:17:38,496 --> 00:17:39,910
You should take care of yourself too.

353
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:42,278
I shall study diligently.

354
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:45,198
Qing Qu.

355
00:17:49,918 --> 00:17:50,797
What is this?

356
00:17:50,797 --> 00:17:53,238
This contains your favorite snacks.

357
00:17:53,597 --> 00:17:55,438
They have food in Mr. Sun's library.

358
00:17:55,837 --> 00:17:56,877
I won't starve there.

359
00:17:57,038 --> 00:17:58,069
That's right, Seventh Lady.

360
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:59,600
Young Master can barely
fit into his outfits.

361
00:17:59,648 --> 00:18:00,710
You should stop feeding him.

362
00:18:01,117 --> 00:18:03,597
I made these snacks myself.
How could they be the same?

363
00:18:03,797 --> 00:18:06,157
I made this loquat custard
early in the morning.

364
00:18:06,238 --> 00:18:08,278
You can share them
with your peers and foster

365
00:18:08,438 --> 00:18:09,438
a closer bond with them.

366
00:18:10,117 --> 00:18:10,837
That won't do.

367
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:11,936
I'll finish it myself.

368
00:18:18,117 --> 00:18:19,117
Take good care of yourself

369
00:18:19,478 --> 00:18:20,438
when I'm not around.

370
00:18:21,278 --> 00:18:22,117
Be wary of Chen Lan.

371
00:18:25,797 --> 00:18:26,678
Don't worry.

372
00:18:44,557 --> 00:18:45,317
Mother,

373
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:48,157
I heard that Mistress Qiao
is seriously ill.

374
00:18:48,357 --> 00:18:49,438
I've heard about it.

375
00:18:49,584 --> 00:18:51,230
I guess what goes around
comes around, huh?

376
00:18:52,278 --> 00:18:54,678
I plan to head to the estate.

377
00:18:54,928 --> 00:18:56,400
You intend to head there again?

378
00:18:57,317 --> 00:18:58,678
Previously, I went to the estate

379
00:18:58,797 --> 00:19:00,637
to ask her about past affairs.

380
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:03,117
But she didn't tell me anything.

381
00:19:03,678 --> 00:19:06,157
Now, I wish to ask her about it again.

382
00:19:06,438 --> 00:19:07,718
Let me join you, then.

383
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:09,278
No need for that.

384
00:19:09,438 --> 00:19:11,958
Our household affairs
are numerous and complicated.

385
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:14,117
The family cannot function without you.

386
00:19:14,438 --> 00:19:16,357
If so, I'll send more men to escort you.

387
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,190
I'm worried
that it might be unsafe out there.

388
00:19:18,806 --> 00:19:20,887
Duke Ying had already
dispatched his troops to deal

389
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:22,224
with the bandits a few days ago.

390
00:19:22,597 --> 00:19:24,718
It's much more peaceful out there now.

391
00:19:27,478 --> 00:19:29,637
All right, Mother.
I'll heed your advice.

392
00:19:39,557 --> 00:19:40,317
Here are the ledgers.

393
00:19:48,038 --> 00:19:49,278
Yining,

394
00:19:49,581 --> 00:19:51,222
can't you read the ledgers at home?

395
00:19:51,248 --> 00:19:52,672
It's rare for us to go out, you know?

396
00:19:52,877 --> 00:19:54,077
Must you read them in the shop?

397
00:19:56,224 --> 00:19:57,350
I think you're just in a hurry

398
00:19:57,357 --> 00:19:58,958
to buy the delicious dishes
of Liuhe Tavern

399
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:00,478
for Sixth Sister.

400
00:20:01,157 --> 00:20:03,278
That's the only thing I can do for her.

401
00:20:03,296 --> 00:20:05,310
Although Madam Chen stopped
forcing her to get married,

402
00:20:05,357 --> 00:20:07,117
she didn't allow her
to leave her room either.

403
00:20:07,238 --> 00:20:09,718
With Yixiu's temper, it'll surely
drive her to the brink.

404
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:12,960
(Yanrong Pavilion)

405
00:20:13,758 --> 00:20:15,718
Shopkeeper!

406
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,300
(Yanrong Pavilion)

407
00:20:17,438 --> 00:20:19,038
What do you need?

408
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:20,958
These are the goods
ordered by Yanrong Pavilion.

409
00:20:21,223 --> 00:20:22,022
Our goods?

410
00:20:25,077 --> 00:20:25,877
Sixth Uncle,

411
00:20:26,597 --> 00:20:27,837
the path that you two are taking

412
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:29,278
is an arduous one.

413
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,079
You won't give up easily, right?

414
00:20:32,478 --> 00:20:33,438
Of course not.

415
00:20:33,557 --> 00:20:34,718
I won't give up

416
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,016
as long as Yixiu doesn't give up.

417
00:20:37,438 --> 00:20:38,157
Madam.

418
00:20:38,157 --> 00:20:40,438
Some unknown goods
appeared outside the shop.

419
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:41,958
Did we order new goods?

420
00:20:52,512 --> 00:20:54,070
This is a sample. Please take a look.

421
00:20:54,077 --> 00:20:55,198
Did you guys order them?

422
00:20:56,117 --> 00:20:56,918
Madam,

423
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:58,678
the guy said we ordered these.

424
00:20:58,678 --> 00:20:59,877
See if they're the right ones.

425
00:21:00,773 --> 00:21:03,117
If we put them on display on the rack,

426
00:21:03,117 --> 00:21:05,157
I'm sure our shop
will look much grander.

427
00:21:05,357 --> 00:21:07,357
Did Third Young Master buy them for you?

428
00:21:08,798 --> 00:21:09,839
Shenyuan bought them, huh?

429
00:21:10,438 --> 00:21:11,438
Is he that wealthy?

430
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:13,038
What else do you like

431
00:21:13,278 --> 00:21:14,317
besides clay dolls?

432
00:21:14,758 --> 00:21:16,317
I'll buy them all for you next time.

433
00:21:16,557 --> 00:21:17,797
I like plenty of things.

434
00:21:18,317 --> 00:21:19,877
I like pearls and agates as well.

435
00:21:20,117 --> 00:21:21,557
I like them as long as they're huge

436
00:21:21,557 --> 00:21:22,797
and valuable.

437
00:21:23,597 --> 00:21:24,877
Mei, I never expected you

438
00:21:25,077 --> 00:21:26,438
to be quite the money-grubber.

439
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:29,117
Seems like
I have to make a lot of money.

440
00:21:30,718 --> 00:21:31,597
Shopkeeper,

441
00:21:31,797 --> 00:21:33,317
the source of these items is unknown.

442
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:34,880
Hand them to the magistrate office.

443
00:21:37,117 --> 00:21:37,478
But...

444
00:21:37,877 --> 00:21:38,678
Sixth Uncle,

445
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:39,797
I need to go on a long trip

446
00:21:39,797 --> 00:21:40,958
in a few more days.

447
00:21:41,438 --> 00:21:43,557
I'll leave Yanrong Pavilion to you.

448
00:21:43,648 --> 00:21:44,670
Where will you be going?

449
00:21:45,758 --> 00:21:46,998
I'll return as soon as possible.

450
00:21:50,972 --> 00:21:54,932
(Yanrong Pavilion)

451
00:21:57,678 --> 00:21:58,918
Have you found Song Ziyun?

452
00:21:59,077 --> 00:21:59,918
Your Lordship,

453
00:22:00,157 --> 00:22:01,117
we've found her.

454
00:22:01,117 --> 00:22:02,198
They're on their way back.

455
00:22:04,478 --> 00:22:05,637
(What if she's the wrong person?)

456
00:22:06,597 --> 00:22:07,478
(What should I do, then?)

457
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,241
Did Luo Yining leave the residence?

458
00:22:14,877 --> 00:22:15,998
She left early in the morning.

459
00:22:17,438 --> 00:22:18,317
Where did she go?

460
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:20,117
I failed to inquire about it.

461
00:22:20,478 --> 00:22:22,438
I guess she's getting impatient
upon hearing

462
00:22:22,624 --> 00:22:24,030
that Mistress Qiao is seriously ill.

463
00:22:25,157 --> 00:22:26,678
Madam, you have a point.

464
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:29,357
Luckily, our men are
keeping an eye on the estate.

465
00:22:30,278 --> 00:22:31,877
Today's the day we've been waiting for.

466
00:22:33,357 --> 00:22:34,918
I suppose you know

467
00:22:35,438 --> 00:22:36,637
what to do next.

468
00:22:36,918 --> 00:22:37,958
I understand.

469
00:22:38,272 --> 00:22:39,430
I'll get to it immediately.

470
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:44,132
(Graceful and Elegant)

471
00:23:09,117 --> 00:23:10,117
Luo Yining?

472
00:23:11,797 --> 00:23:12,918
What are you doing here?

473
00:23:13,278 --> 00:23:14,317
Mistress Qiao, I came here

474
00:23:14,438 --> 00:23:16,117
to check on you.

475
00:23:17,077 --> 00:23:17,877
I'm fine.

476
00:23:19,321 --> 00:23:20,200
I'm doing great.

477
00:23:23,837 --> 00:23:25,157
Stop pretending to be kind.

478
00:23:33,335 --> 00:23:34,855
The result was out a few days ago.

479
00:23:35,718 --> 00:23:37,597
Xuan failed the exam.

480
00:23:39,038 --> 00:23:41,117
I wonder if you can wait until

481
00:23:41,117 --> 00:23:42,478
the day Xuan passes the exam.

482
00:23:46,374 --> 00:23:47,877
So, are you here

483
00:23:47,877 --> 00:23:49,758
to mock Xuan today?

484
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:52,064
Mistress Qiao, I came here today

485
00:23:52,361 --> 00:23:54,082
to give you a piece of advice.

486
00:23:55,278 --> 00:23:57,278
I have no intention of harming you.

487
00:23:57,718 --> 00:23:59,597
I can't say the same
for the rest of them.

488
00:23:59,958 --> 00:24:01,317
I've already told you

489
00:24:01,317 --> 00:24:03,278
everything you need to know.

490
00:24:04,117 --> 00:24:06,077
But you were the head
of the family back then.

491
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:08,144
You governed everything that was used
in the household.

492
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,350
How could you not know
what my mother had touched

493
00:24:10,637 --> 00:24:12,597
- or used before?
- I do know.

494
00:24:13,375 --> 00:24:15,014
But I don't feel like
telling you about it.

495
00:24:16,117 --> 00:24:18,438
You wanted to gather evidence, right?
Go ahead.

496
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:19,877
You can take your time.

497
00:24:20,238 --> 00:24:21,557
You can't solve the case forever.

498
00:24:21,557 --> 00:24:22,998
Just give up.

499
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,830
Aren't you afraid
that you might be silenced

500
00:24:24,837 --> 00:24:26,157
if you hide the truth like this?

501
00:24:29,238 --> 00:24:30,797
I can hire the best physician for you

502
00:24:30,958 --> 00:24:32,958
and help you escape from this hellhole

503
00:24:33,056 --> 00:24:34,310
as long as you tell me the truth.

504
00:24:37,117 --> 00:24:38,317
Look here!

505
00:24:38,678 --> 00:24:40,238
Just look at this place!

506
00:24:41,117 --> 00:24:42,758
I don't wish to be cured!

507
00:24:43,918 --> 00:24:45,117
What have I done wrong?

508
00:24:46,117 --> 00:24:47,438
Xuan!

509
00:24:48,238 --> 00:24:49,637
My children!

510
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:52,478
They grew up
in the Luo's Residence too!

511
00:24:53,278 --> 00:24:54,317
Tell me!

512
00:24:55,157 --> 00:24:56,958
What have they done wrong?

513
00:24:57,438 --> 00:24:58,438
Are you happy now?

514
00:24:59,117 --> 00:25:00,718
Are you happy

515
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,879
that my son and my daughter
are in a sorry state?

516
00:25:04,038 --> 00:25:05,597
Are you satisfied now?

517
00:25:06,837 --> 00:25:07,958
You were the reason

518
00:25:08,958 --> 00:25:10,478
my family was shattered!

519
00:25:11,278 --> 00:25:12,478
It's all your fault!

520
00:25:14,958 --> 00:25:16,198
You're a vixen!

521
00:25:16,918 --> 00:25:18,278
You're a vixen!

522
00:25:18,656 --> 00:25:19,950
You're still pretending, huh?

523
00:25:20,117 --> 00:25:21,758
You're a vixen!

524
00:25:21,877 --> 00:25:23,278
Tell me why!

525
00:25:23,597 --> 00:25:24,238
Let go!

526
00:25:24,438 --> 00:25:25,278
Let go!

527
00:25:25,438 --> 00:25:26,229
Young Lady!

528
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:27,072
- Go!
- What's going on?

529
00:25:27,104 --> 00:25:28,310
Kill me if you dare!

530
00:25:28,637 --> 00:25:30,797
I'll haunt you as a spirit after death!

531
00:25:30,797 --> 00:25:31,438
Let's go!

532
00:25:31,958 --> 00:25:33,238
Look! She's scared!

533
00:25:33,758 --> 00:25:34,397
Just go!

534
00:25:35,918 --> 00:25:36,918
She's terrified!

535
00:25:40,718 --> 00:25:42,438
Seventh Lady, are you okay?

536
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,230
Why don't you rest
in the main room for now?

537
00:25:44,238 --> 00:25:45,557
I'll hire a physician for you.

538
00:25:47,117 --> 00:25:47,837
No need for that.

539
00:25:48,718 --> 00:25:49,478
Young Lady,

540
00:25:49,637 --> 00:25:51,157
I think she's already lost her mind.

541
00:25:51,238 --> 00:25:52,278
She's a lunatic now.

542
00:25:52,278 --> 00:25:53,629
Seventh Lady, tell me.

543
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:55,056
How would you like to deal with her?

544
00:26:07,117 --> 00:26:08,038
What are you guys doing?

545
00:26:11,678 --> 00:26:12,557
Hurry!

546
00:26:12,597 --> 00:26:13,397
Feed her!

547
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:25,797
Mother.

548
00:26:26,278 --> 00:26:27,397
Yining, you've returned.

549
00:26:27,438 --> 00:26:28,637
Is everything okay?

550
00:26:29,198 --> 00:26:30,278
I'm fine.

551
00:26:30,637 --> 00:26:31,797
Why exactly did you find her

552
00:26:31,837 --> 00:26:33,998
time and time again?

553
00:26:34,878 --> 00:26:37,071
I haven't solved the case yet.

554
00:26:37,072 --> 00:26:38,270
Mother, I'll tell you everything

555
00:26:38,278 --> 00:26:40,117
once the case is solved.

556
00:26:41,637 --> 00:26:42,397
All right, then.

557
00:26:42,637 --> 00:26:44,397
You should return
to your room and rest first.

558
00:26:45,117 --> 00:26:46,278
I shall take my leave first.

559
00:26:53,397 --> 00:26:55,998
I wonder how Mother
is doing at the estate?

560
00:26:56,198 --> 00:26:56,998
Later,

561
00:26:57,278 --> 00:26:58,278
I think I'll tell Father

562
00:26:58,278 --> 00:26:59,397
to hire a physician for her.

563
00:26:59,648 --> 00:27:00,576
Don't you think so?

564
00:27:06,117 --> 00:27:08,117
Xuan, stop sleeping.

565
00:27:08,117 --> 00:27:09,077
Get up and study.

566
00:27:13,797 --> 00:27:14,597
Fifth Sister,

567
00:27:15,758 --> 00:27:17,238
do you think I can pass the exam?

568
00:27:17,317 --> 00:27:18,317
Of course.

569
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,199
I'm sure you can pass the exam

570
00:27:20,397 --> 00:27:21,789
as long as you study hard.

571
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:23,550
Mother is waiting for you
to become a palace graduate

572
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:24,960
and bring her back
to the residence.

573
00:27:29,117 --> 00:27:30,438
Young Lady! Young Master!

574
00:27:30,557 --> 00:27:32,637
- This is bad!
- You look so flustered.

575
00:27:32,637 --> 00:27:33,837
You shouldn't behave as such.

576
00:27:34,117 --> 00:27:34,918
What happened?

577
00:27:35,344 --> 00:27:37,430
I heard from the servants
at the front of the residence

578
00:27:37,744 --> 00:27:39,390
that we received a letter
from the estate.

579
00:27:41,557 --> 00:27:42,317
Mistress Qiao

580
00:27:43,357 --> 00:27:44,157
is dead.

581
00:27:57,749 --> 00:27:58,870
What did you say?

582
00:28:00,597 --> 00:28:01,357
Mistress Qiao

583
00:28:02,397 --> 00:28:02,998
is dead.

584
00:28:31,998 --> 00:28:32,797
Young Lady,

585
00:28:32,837 --> 00:28:34,797
the trip must've taken a toll on you.

586
00:28:36,157 --> 00:28:36,998
Luo Yining!

587
00:28:37,637 --> 00:28:39,438
- Luo Yining! Come out!
- You can't go inside!

588
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,270
Get out of my way!

589
00:28:40,758 --> 00:28:42,117
Luo Yining, come out!

590
00:28:42,478 --> 00:28:42,998
Come out!

591
00:28:42,998 --> 00:28:45,198
Why are you causing a commotion
in my yard?

592
00:28:45,758 --> 00:28:47,958
My mother is already dead!
I don't need to care anymore!

593
00:28:48,032 --> 00:28:49,744
- I'll fight you to the death!
- Young Lady!

594
00:28:49,958 --> 00:28:50,758
Stop.

595
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,950
The truth hasn't been revealed yet.

596
00:28:52,958 --> 00:28:53,918
What are you saying?

597
00:28:54,797 --> 00:28:55,597
Father!

598
00:28:55,637 --> 00:28:57,557
You must uphold justice for my mother!

599
00:28:57,597 --> 00:28:58,357
Yilian.

600
00:28:58,797 --> 00:29:00,637
You're causing a commotion
when you're a girl.

601
00:29:00,637 --> 00:29:02,278
How could you do so? Get up and speak.

602
00:29:02,278 --> 00:29:04,438
Father, Mother is dead!

603
00:29:04,637 --> 00:29:06,278
It's all Luo Yining's fault!

604
00:29:07,317 --> 00:29:08,797
Yuechan is dead?

605
00:29:12,637 --> 00:29:15,077
Stop pretending to be innocent!

606
00:29:15,278 --> 00:29:17,117
You went to the estate
to murder my mother!

607
00:29:17,357 --> 00:29:19,637
Everyone in the estate
could attest to that!

608
00:29:19,797 --> 00:29:21,397
What do you have to say for yourself?

609
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,020
My mother passed away right after

610
00:29:23,152 --> 00:29:24,230
Seventh Sister visited her.

611
00:29:24,397 --> 00:29:25,837
I'm sure she murdered Mother!

612
00:29:27,797 --> 00:29:29,797
Father, please uphold justice
for my mother!

613
00:29:33,278 --> 00:29:34,317
Get up.

614
00:29:38,918 --> 00:29:39,718
Yining.

615
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:41,278
Let me ask you this.

616
00:29:41,637 --> 00:29:44,038
Why did you go to the estate
in search of Qiao Yuechan?

617
00:29:47,678 --> 00:29:49,557
I went to the estate to ask her

618
00:29:49,557 --> 00:29:50,918
about my mother.

619
00:29:51,431 --> 00:29:52,871
But she didn't tell me anything.

620
00:29:53,797 --> 00:29:54,958
You're lying!

621
00:29:55,797 --> 00:29:57,117
You fought with my mother

622
00:29:57,117 --> 00:29:58,877
when you were at the estate!

623
00:29:59,077 --> 00:30:00,678
I'm sure you sent someone to murder her

624
00:30:00,837 --> 00:30:02,958
to vent your frustrations!

625
00:30:03,117 --> 00:30:03,918
Second Master,

626
00:30:04,157 --> 00:30:06,117
I'm sure there's a misunderstanding.

627
00:30:06,566 --> 00:30:07,837
Yining stopped me

628
00:30:07,837 --> 00:30:09,117
from dealing with Mistress Qiao.

629
00:30:09,238 --> 00:30:11,038
How could she murder her?

630
00:30:13,958 --> 00:30:15,198
You're accusing me

631
00:30:15,238 --> 00:30:16,557
of murdering her.

632
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,576
Do you have any witnesses
or evidence to prove it?

633
00:30:21,478 --> 00:30:22,877
Although she tried to harm me,

634
00:30:23,438 --> 00:30:25,478
I hired a physician for her

635
00:30:25,478 --> 00:30:27,518
before I left.
Why would I need to do so

636
00:30:27,678 --> 00:30:28,958
if I truly intended to murder her?

637
00:30:29,117 --> 00:30:30,749
You're the murderer here.

638
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:32,896
You can answer that question yourself!
How should I know?

639
00:30:33,357 --> 00:30:35,317
Father, let's stop the conversation.

640
00:30:35,317 --> 00:30:36,430
Let's report to the authorities.

641
00:30:36,438 --> 00:30:38,109
Let the magistrate office
investigate the case!

642
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,216
We can't afford to do so.

643
00:30:40,117 --> 00:30:41,557
The case hasn't been solved yet.

644
00:30:51,438 --> 00:30:53,238
Yilian, Xuanyuan,

645
00:30:53,918 --> 00:30:55,077
you two should head back first.

646
00:30:55,198 --> 00:30:55,998
Don't worry.

647
00:30:56,192 --> 00:30:57,470
Regarding Yuechan's incident,

648
00:30:57,718 --> 00:30:59,397
I'll definitely
give you guys an account.

649
00:31:04,958 --> 00:31:05,758
Yining,

650
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,559
you should head back too.

651
00:31:23,918 --> 00:31:24,718
Second Master,

652
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,350
the source has been verified.

653
00:31:26,438 --> 00:31:27,998
Pufferfish toxin was used.

654
00:31:28,877 --> 00:31:30,077
Pufferfish fish toxin?

655
00:31:31,478 --> 00:31:32,278
Hairu,

656
00:31:32,918 --> 00:31:33,918
didn't Yining arrange

657
00:31:34,478 --> 00:31:36,077
for a pufferfish feast before this?

658
00:31:36,718 --> 00:31:37,478
That's impossible.

659
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,797
Why would Yining
commit such atrocious deeds?

660
00:31:40,821 --> 00:31:42,821
Second Master,
are you suspecting Yining now?

661
00:31:43,671 --> 00:31:44,832
I didn't say that.

662
00:31:46,637 --> 00:31:48,637
If I want to clear Yining's name,

663
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:51,278
I also need to get
the full story straight.

664
00:31:52,238 --> 00:31:53,038
Moreover,

665
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:55,280
I think the questions
that Yining had directed

666
00:31:55,797 --> 00:31:57,438
toward Yilian
sounded reasonable as well.

667
00:32:00,357 --> 00:32:01,157
Butler Bai,

668
00:32:01,958 --> 00:32:02,958
how many people

669
00:32:03,478 --> 00:32:04,758
know about the incident?

670
00:32:04,758 --> 00:32:06,837
Only those in the estate.

671
00:32:06,837 --> 00:32:09,278
I've already instructed my men
to keep them in check.

672
00:32:09,357 --> 00:32:10,157
If so,

673
00:32:12,438 --> 00:32:15,278
where is Qiao Yuechan's body now?

674
00:32:16,837 --> 00:32:17,637
Mistress Qiao's body

675
00:32:18,117 --> 00:32:19,837
is still at the estate.

676
00:32:22,672 --> 00:32:24,230
Luckily, Old Madam went to the mountains

677
00:32:24,238 --> 00:32:25,597
for her Buddha praying ceremony.

678
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:26,800
If not...

679
00:32:29,278 --> 00:32:30,117
Butler Bai,

680
00:32:30,438 --> 00:32:32,797
keep this incident a secret.

681
00:32:33,438 --> 00:32:35,357
Tell all the servants

682
00:32:35,797 --> 00:32:37,478
to keep their mouths shut.

683
00:32:42,397 --> 00:32:43,918
You know what to do, right?

684
00:32:49,678 --> 00:32:51,797
Your parents will be fine

685
00:32:52,325 --> 00:32:54,805
as long as you do a good job at it.

686
00:32:55,934 --> 00:32:57,254
I'll definitely do my best.

687
00:32:57,357 --> 00:32:59,117
Madam, please show them mercy.

688
00:33:00,357 --> 00:33:01,238
Go now.

689
00:33:14,637 --> 00:33:15,958
I'll head to the estate

690
00:33:16,117 --> 00:33:17,317
to clarify the situation.

691
00:33:17,317 --> 00:33:19,557
My dear, why don't you let me join you?

692
00:33:20,238 --> 00:33:21,198
You should stay here.

693
00:33:21,232 --> 00:33:22,430
At least you can take control

694
00:33:22,430 --> 00:33:23,840
of the situation if anything happens.

695
00:33:23,888 --> 00:33:24,270
All right.

696
00:33:26,278 --> 00:33:28,238
Second Master,
the magistrate officers are here.

697
00:33:34,278 --> 00:33:35,038
Registrar Luo,

698
00:33:35,038 --> 00:33:36,718
I'm here to arrest
the suspect, Luo Yining,

699
00:33:36,718 --> 00:33:38,837
under the magistrate's order.

700
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,400
Young Lady, you should eat up.

701
00:33:50,718 --> 00:33:52,397
You haven't eaten well

702
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:53,397
since yesterday.

703
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:55,918
I feel restless.

704
00:33:56,623 --> 00:33:57,623
It feels like

705
00:33:57,918 --> 00:33:59,157
everything's off.

706
00:34:02,678 --> 00:34:04,157
But I can't figure it out.

707
00:34:06,198 --> 00:34:07,837
Song Zhi was acting strange.

708
00:34:07,837 --> 00:34:09,309
She disappeared early in the morning.

709
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:10,704
No one moved the flower pots.

710
00:34:10,736 --> 00:34:11,310
Seventh Lady!

711
00:34:11,597 --> 00:34:12,358
Butler Bai?

712
00:34:16,398 --> 00:34:17,197
Seventh Lady,

713
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,950
Second Master has invited you
to Caifu Abode.

714
00:34:19,798 --> 00:34:21,838
Did something happen?

715
00:34:22,597 --> 00:34:24,918
Your maid, Song Zhi,
had reported you to the authorities.

716
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:27,088
She accused you
of murdering Mistress Qiao.

717
00:34:29,958 --> 00:34:30,918
Sir,

718
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:32,768
this incident has plenty
of questionable points.

719
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,700
Can you please be lenient with us?

720
00:34:34,757 --> 00:34:36,838
Official Luo, you don't need
to be nervous.

721
00:34:36,838 --> 00:34:37,998
We'll invite Seventh Lady

722
00:34:37,998 --> 00:34:39,398
to the magistrate office for a chat.

723
00:34:39,478 --> 00:34:40,318
Mainly,

724
00:34:40,318 --> 00:34:42,390
our newly appointed magistrate
has known the incident.

725
00:34:42,398 --> 00:34:44,838
You know how it is. New officials
like to make a big impression.

726
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:45,700
(Caifu Abode)

727
00:34:45,878 --> 00:34:46,438
Father.

728
00:34:47,808 --> 00:34:48,720
Did you call for me?

729
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:50,117
Seventh Lady,

730
00:34:50,117 --> 00:34:51,117
your servant, Song Zhi,

731
00:34:51,117 --> 00:34:52,597
accused you of murdering Mistress Qiao.

732
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:54,220
Please follow us
to the magistrate office.

733
00:34:54,224 --> 00:34:55,344
I didn't murder Mistress Qiao.

734
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,680
You have to follow us back
no matter if you've done it or not.

735
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,870
Please come with us.

736
00:34:59,117 --> 00:34:59,677
Wait.

737
00:35:00,230 --> 00:35:01,549
Song Zhi is just a lowly maid.

738
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:03,750
She's making baseless accusations.
Do you have any evidence?

739
00:35:03,757 --> 00:35:04,717
Since someone reported her,

740
00:35:04,717 --> 00:35:05,878
as a suspect, she needs
to be taken away.

741
00:35:05,878 --> 00:35:06,998
Seventh Lady will be fine

742
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:08,940
if there's insufficient evidence
to prove her crime.

743
00:35:08,943 --> 00:35:09,983
Yining won't commit murder.

744
00:35:10,589 --> 00:35:12,189
I'm sure someone's trying to frame her.

745
00:35:12,398 --> 00:35:13,717
If Yining is sent to prison,

746
00:35:13,824 --> 00:35:15,830
maybe she'll encounter
something dangerous inside.

747
00:35:16,237 --> 00:35:16,998
Madam Lin,

748
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:18,512
are you covering up for the suspect

749
00:35:18,512 --> 00:35:20,080
and obstructing us
from executing our duties?

750
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,110
- I!
- Sir.

751
00:35:22,358 --> 00:35:23,637
Please be appeased.

752
00:35:24,318 --> 00:35:25,117
Hairu.

753
00:35:25,776 --> 00:35:27,296
There's something off
about the incident.

754
00:35:27,328 --> 00:35:28,990
It's pointless for you
to obstruct the office

755
00:35:29,197 --> 00:35:30,677
from carrying out their duties.

756
00:35:30,717 --> 00:35:32,277
Why don't you let the officer

757
00:35:32,304 --> 00:35:34,000
take Yining
to the magistrate office first?

758
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:34,550
You!

759
00:35:34,798 --> 00:35:36,277
Let's think of something else later.

760
00:35:36,277 --> 00:35:37,077
Mother,

761
00:35:37,478 --> 00:35:38,798
I'll follow them.

762
00:35:39,077 --> 00:35:41,117
Just don't tell Grandma
and Third Brother about this.

763
00:35:42,159 --> 00:35:43,159
My conscience is clear.

764
00:35:44,117 --> 00:35:45,677
I'll come back safely.

765
00:35:46,277 --> 00:35:46,878
Take her away.

766
00:35:48,277 --> 00:35:49,918
Sir, my daughter has
a weak constitution.

767
00:35:49,918 --> 00:35:51,358
- Let's go.
- Please look after her.

768
00:36:23,757 --> 00:36:24,438
Young Master.

769
00:36:24,637 --> 00:36:26,277
Why do you look distracted lately?

770
00:36:26,277 --> 00:36:27,438
You look restless.

771
00:36:27,824 --> 00:36:30,070
You're not eating the loquat custard
I had served you with.

772
00:36:30,112 --> 00:36:31,488
Are you full just from admiring it?

773
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:32,881
That's right.

774
00:36:33,398 --> 00:36:34,637
Fine. I'll stop talking.

775
00:36:39,328 --> 00:36:40,710
Now, I realize that the items and food

776
00:36:40,798 --> 00:36:41,958
prepared by Seventh Lady

777
00:36:41,998 --> 00:36:43,469
are not meant to be used or consumed.

778
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:45,090
You would gladly worship them
if you could.

779
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:46,544
Didn't you say you would stop talking?

780
00:36:49,478 --> 00:36:50,597
Third Young Master Luo.

781
00:36:56,798 --> 00:36:57,597
Young Lady Sun.

782
00:36:59,838 --> 00:37:01,069
Third Young Master,

783
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:02,720
I think you haven't
departed for the academy.

784
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,070
So I've brought you some snacks.

785
00:37:05,998 --> 00:37:06,998
Thank you, Young Lady Sun.

786
00:37:07,237 --> 00:37:08,438
I appreciate your intention.

787
00:37:12,944 --> 00:37:15,430
So, Third Young Master Luo,
you already brought your own snacks.

788
00:37:16,398 --> 00:37:17,438
This loquat custard

789
00:37:17,798 --> 00:37:18,958
looks amazing.

790
00:37:22,637 --> 00:37:24,637
You should try mine as well.

791
00:37:29,438 --> 00:37:31,398
If so, I'll stop bothering you.

792
00:37:33,197 --> 00:37:33,757
Thank you.

793
00:37:45,277 --> 00:37:46,117
Young Master,

794
00:37:46,398 --> 00:37:49,117
don't tell me Young Lady Sun
has fallen for you?

795
00:37:57,117 --> 00:37:57,918
Eat this.

796
00:37:58,318 --> 00:37:59,677
I hope they can shut you up.

797
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,548
(Danhua Abode)

798
00:38:10,637 --> 00:38:11,478
Madam!

799
00:38:11,798 --> 00:38:12,677
Madam.

800
00:38:13,237 --> 00:38:14,117
The deed is done.

801
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,160
Was she arrested?

802
00:38:21,798 --> 00:38:23,958
First Master,
what are you doing here?

803
00:38:24,096 --> 00:38:25,392
I assume you've heard of it.

804
00:38:25,759 --> 00:38:27,319
Yining was arrested.

805
00:38:27,798 --> 00:38:28,757
But why?

806
00:38:28,998 --> 00:38:31,038
I heard from her maids

807
00:38:31,557 --> 00:38:33,958
that she murdered Mistress Qiao
using pufferfish toxin.

808
00:38:34,038 --> 00:38:35,117
It's because Mistress Qiao

809
00:38:35,117 --> 00:38:36,197
used pufferfish toxin

810
00:38:36,455 --> 00:38:37,615
to murder Minglan back then.

811
00:38:41,438 --> 00:38:42,677
I only found out not long ago

812
00:38:42,798 --> 00:38:44,358
that Madam Gu

813
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:46,623
was actually poisoned to death.

814
00:38:48,998 --> 00:38:49,958
It's no wonder

815
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,039
Seventh Lady

816
00:38:52,605 --> 00:38:54,125
wanted to have a pufferfish feast.

817
00:38:54,637 --> 00:38:57,077
She was looking for cooks
who could prepare pufferfish.

818
00:38:58,318 --> 00:39:00,277
So, this was her intention all along.

819
00:39:02,597 --> 00:39:04,637
But, it's reasonable for her

820
00:39:05,318 --> 00:39:06,878
to hate Mistress Qiao.

821
00:39:08,237 --> 00:39:09,038
In my opinion,

822
00:39:09,557 --> 00:39:11,597
Yining is the kindest child
in the world.

823
00:39:11,958 --> 00:39:13,789
I'm sure she won't murder Mistress Qiao

824
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:15,440
even if she finds out
that she's the culprit.

825
00:39:15,798 --> 00:39:16,398
First Master,

826
00:39:17,375 --> 00:39:19,375
this is
the second principal wife's affair.

827
00:39:20,038 --> 00:39:21,438
We should

828
00:39:21,677 --> 00:39:23,038
stay out of their affairs.

829
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:24,432
Do you know the situation we're in?

830
00:39:24,637 --> 00:39:25,918
Why are you making distinctions?

831
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:29,038
Right now, our priority
is to save the child.

832
00:39:29,487 --> 00:39:30,688
The magistrate office

833
00:39:30,832 --> 00:39:32,600
will uphold justice
for the people's sake.

834
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:34,406
Even if we're anxious about it,

835
00:39:34,438 --> 00:39:36,038
there's nothing we can do about it.

836
00:39:38,336 --> 00:39:40,110
First Master,
it's rare for you to come here.

837
00:39:41,438 --> 00:39:42,478
Let's have some tea.

838
00:39:55,318 --> 00:39:56,398
I'll be heading to the estate.

839
00:39:57,277 --> 00:39:59,117
Keep an eye on the residence.

840
00:39:59,358 --> 00:40:00,438
If there's anything urgent,

841
00:40:00,478 --> 00:40:01,637
send someone to notify me.

842
00:40:01,798 --> 00:40:02,958
My dear, please take care.

843
00:40:02,958 --> 00:40:03,878
Please come back soon.

844
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:04,738
(Luo's Residence)

845
00:40:10,478 --> 00:40:12,597
Second Master, we received
another letter from the estate.

846
00:40:12,839 --> 00:40:13,998
What's wrong again?

847
00:40:14,197 --> 00:40:14,757
They say

848
00:40:15,077 --> 00:40:16,478
Mistress Qiao's body has vanished.

849
00:40:16,757 --> 00:40:17,478
Vanished?

850
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:22,190
Tell your men to look for it!

851
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:22,832
Yes, Madam.

852
00:40:38,077 --> 00:40:38,478
Go inside!

853
00:40:57,277 --> 00:40:57,998
Go!

854
00:41:03,038 --> 00:41:03,798
What are you doing?

855
00:41:05,038 --> 00:41:06,749
- What's wrong?
- Young Lady, this won't do.

856
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:08,318
Why not think
of something else tomorrow?

857
00:41:08,318 --> 00:41:09,878
Let's ask about
Seventh Lady's condition.

858
00:41:10,157 --> 00:41:11,117
We can't even

859
00:41:11,117 --> 00:41:12,277
receive any news during the day.

860
00:41:12,277 --> 00:41:13,370
Now no one is here at night,

861
00:41:13,376 --> 00:41:14,950
I have to sneak outside and ask Lin Mao

862
00:41:14,958 --> 00:41:16,197
how Seventh Sister is doing.

863
00:41:16,197 --> 00:41:17,398
My goodness. Let's go, then.

864
00:41:24,544 --> 00:41:25,568
Let's go and take a look.

865
00:41:26,277 --> 00:41:26,677
Let's go.

866
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,550
You can't even
complete such a simple task?

867
00:41:37,256 --> 00:41:38,856
You haven't found the body yet?

868
00:41:39,237 --> 00:41:40,478
Madam, please be appeased.

869
00:41:40,557 --> 00:41:42,077
We're searching for it as we speak.

870
00:41:45,118 --> 00:41:46,359
How could Mistress Qiao's body

871
00:41:46,398 --> 00:41:47,878
vanish all of a sudden?

872
00:41:49,094 --> 00:41:51,014
Who would steal her corpse?

873
00:41:51,478 --> 00:41:53,197
I was perplexed as well.

874
00:41:53,277 --> 00:41:55,438
That estate was under our surveillance

875
00:41:55,478 --> 00:41:57,077
24/7.

876
00:41:57,077 --> 00:41:59,277
Not even a bird could fly out.

877
00:42:00,798 --> 00:42:03,358
I'm sure someone's behind it.

878
00:42:03,878 --> 00:42:05,077
What's even stranger is

879
00:42:05,157 --> 00:42:06,318
that the second principal wife

880
00:42:06,438 --> 00:42:08,157
intends to locate
the body during the day.

881
00:42:08,358 --> 00:42:09,358
But when it's nighttime,

882
00:42:09,597 --> 00:42:11,237
Second Master suddenly said

883
00:42:11,312 --> 00:42:12,590
that they're dropping the search.

884
00:42:12,597 --> 00:42:14,438
If they can't locate the body,

885
00:42:14,512 --> 00:42:16,832
they won't be able to do an autopsy
and confirm the crime.

886
00:42:16,998 --> 00:42:17,958
If so, the lass

887
00:42:18,398 --> 00:42:20,197
will be released.

888
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:21,757
Madam,

889
00:42:21,918 --> 00:42:23,557
what if we can't locate

890
00:42:23,557 --> 00:42:25,597
her body?

891
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,712
If so, make sure

892
00:42:27,717 --> 00:42:29,277
that she doesn't leave the prison alive.

893
00:42:30,318 --> 00:42:32,157
Madam, do you mean...

894
00:42:32,677 --> 00:42:33,798
Try and get rid of her

895
00:42:34,597 --> 00:42:35,958
inside the prison.

896
00:42:38,157 --> 00:42:39,798
I understand.

897
00:42:45,478 --> 00:42:46,637
Are you saying

898
00:42:47,157 --> 00:42:48,838
that your mother is
trying to murder Yining?

899
00:42:50,358 --> 00:42:51,237
But why?

900
00:42:51,424 --> 00:42:53,328
They don't have a grudge
against each other.

901
00:42:53,478 --> 00:42:54,958
I have no idea either.

902
00:42:55,277 --> 00:42:57,038
Don't tell me your mother
was partly involved

903
00:42:57,237 --> 00:42:58,318
in Yining's arrest.

904
00:42:59,197 --> 00:43:01,117
I dare not think about it.
I'm so scared.

905
00:43:01,237 --> 00:43:02,918
All right now. Let's not think about it.

906
00:43:04,637 --> 00:43:05,398
Yixiu...

907
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,600
Seventh Sister will never commit murder.

908
00:43:07,958 --> 00:43:10,358
Mother won't do something
like that either.

909
00:43:10,358 --> 00:43:11,117
I...

910
00:43:11,117 --> 00:43:11,838
Yixiu,

911
00:43:12,096 --> 00:43:13,630
the truth is still under investigation.

912
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:15,616
You mustn't let
your imagination run wild.

913
00:43:16,637 --> 00:43:18,197
Does anyone else know about this?

914
00:43:18,998 --> 00:43:20,717
I only told you about it.

915
00:43:20,717 --> 00:43:21,438
Great.

916
00:43:22,478 --> 00:43:24,038
You should act the same as usual,

917
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:25,590
including the way you treat your mother.

918
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:47,699
♪It's complicated but I'm not afraid♪

919
00:43:48,722 --> 00:43:55,058
