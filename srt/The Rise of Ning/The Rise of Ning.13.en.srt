=The Rise of Ning=

2
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,320
(Adapted from Wen Tan's novel "Chancellor
Training Handbook" from Jinjiang Literature)

3
00:01:36,441 --> 00:01:38,721
=Episode 13=

4
00:01:46,042 --> 00:01:48,041
Fear not, your disguise is impeccable.

5
00:01:48,042 --> 00:01:49,241
We lost Lu Jiaxue's men.

6
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:50,601
Good to know that.

7
00:01:53,882 --> 00:01:55,761
Enough with the long faces.

8
00:01:55,762 --> 00:01:56,881
It makes you look old.

9
00:01:57,441 --> 00:01:59,761
Besides, we didn't return empty-handed.

10
00:01:59,801 --> 00:02:02,241
The lead with the Mongolian
milkvetch and peony tonic is lost.

11
00:02:02,281 --> 00:02:03,508
We didn't make any progress.

12
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:05,178
Eliminating false leads

13
00:02:05,179 --> 00:02:07,100
is one way to reach the goal.

14
00:02:07,561 --> 00:02:10,081
Third Brother, judging by the motive,

15
00:02:10,082 --> 00:02:12,321
is Mistress Qiao the main suspect?

16
00:02:12,682 --> 00:02:13,801
Yes.

17
00:02:14,842 --> 00:02:17,081
We shouldn't have let her go so soon.

18
00:02:18,362 --> 00:02:19,921
The case was buried ages ago.

19
00:02:19,922 --> 00:02:21,081
If she stays in the residence,

20
00:02:21,082 --> 00:02:22,440
I doubt she will tell you anything.

21
00:02:22,441 --> 00:02:23,740
But with her gone,

22
00:02:23,741 --> 00:02:25,301
it's easier for us to investigate.

23
00:02:26,001 --> 00:02:27,921
But she was the only lead.

24
00:02:28,601 --> 00:02:29,842
What is on your mind?

25
00:02:31,721 --> 00:02:33,002
Let's go to Mistress Qiao.

26
00:02:33,369 --> 00:02:36,462
(Caifu Abode)

27
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,261
Rui Xiang.

28
00:02:53,431 --> 00:02:54,670
Why do I smell

29
00:02:54,671 --> 00:02:56,352
a pleasant scent in the air?

30
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,781
Mother.

31
00:02:59,441 --> 00:03:00,761
Yining, you're here.

32
00:03:00,922 --> 00:03:02,682
You could've told me.

33
00:03:03,441 --> 00:03:06,040
I had been sick recently.

34
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:08,282
I couldn't help you
with bookkeeping.

35
00:03:08,362 --> 00:03:09,600
But I am well now.

36
00:03:09,601 --> 00:03:11,600
It's time I help you with work.

37
00:03:11,601 --> 00:03:13,801
You just recovered.
Don't push yourself too hard.

38
00:03:14,082 --> 00:03:17,361
However, the old supervisor
is not as capable as you.

39
00:03:17,362 --> 00:03:19,842
It's been quite exhausting
these past few days.

40
00:03:20,082 --> 00:03:22,000
I finally checked and sorted out

41
00:03:22,001 --> 00:03:23,241
all the money in our family.

42
00:03:23,242 --> 00:03:25,601
That brings some ease to my mind.

43
00:03:25,881 --> 00:03:28,681
Now that the work is done,

44
00:03:28,682 --> 00:03:31,081
why don't we go to the estate?

45
00:03:32,041 --> 00:03:33,402
We should go there.

46
00:03:33,441 --> 00:03:35,480
I plan to go there soon.

47
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:37,560
Could I tag along?

48
00:03:37,561 --> 00:03:38,600
Certainly.

49
00:03:38,601 --> 00:03:41,522
I plan to check the estate
in the western district.

50
00:03:42,922 --> 00:03:43,880
Perhaps

51
00:03:43,881 --> 00:03:45,921
we should check the one
in the eastern district.

52
00:03:45,922 --> 00:03:47,081
No.

53
00:03:47,441 --> 00:03:48,801
Why not?

54
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:50,562
Mistress Qiao is there.

55
00:03:50,802 --> 00:03:51,881
I don't wish to see her.

56
00:04:01,281 --> 00:04:02,402
All right.

57
00:04:02,441 --> 00:04:04,081
You weren't candid

58
00:04:04,082 --> 00:04:05,761
about seeing Mistress Qiao.

59
00:04:05,842 --> 00:04:08,201
Is she up to no good again?

60
00:04:08,522 --> 00:04:11,321
Nothing escapes your brilliant mind.

61
00:04:12,242 --> 00:04:14,081
I want to ask her

62
00:04:14,082 --> 00:04:15,481
about the past.

63
00:04:15,561 --> 00:04:17,001
If you've been mistreated,

64
00:04:17,002 --> 00:04:18,722
you must let me know.

65
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:21,402
Don't worry, I am all right.

66
00:04:21,842 --> 00:04:22,962
Good to know that.

67
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,990
Fine. When I go,

68
00:04:24,991 --> 00:04:26,511
I'll let you know.

69
00:04:28,082 --> 00:04:30,481
Madam Lin and Luo Yining
are going to the estates?

70
00:04:31,082 --> 00:04:32,761
What do they want?

71
00:04:32,762 --> 00:04:34,441
They've hurt my mother enough.

72
00:04:34,442 --> 00:04:36,041
What more do they want?

73
00:04:36,481 --> 00:04:37,681
Perhaps

74
00:04:37,801 --> 00:04:40,402
they are doing an inspection.

75
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,001
Why would Luo Yining go with her?

76
00:04:42,002 --> 00:04:43,600
Why are they going
to the eastern estate

77
00:04:43,601 --> 00:04:45,160
instead of the western estate?

78
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:46,282
Well...

79
00:04:58,642 --> 00:05:00,522
Hurry up!

80
00:05:00,562 --> 00:05:02,120
No dillydallying!

81
00:05:02,121 --> 00:05:03,441
Put some strength into it!

82
00:05:03,442 --> 00:05:04,561
Pick up the pace!

83
00:05:05,721 --> 00:05:06,882
I'm talking to you!

84
00:05:07,442 --> 00:05:08,561
Hurry up!

85
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:18,402
Get out of here if you can't work.

86
00:05:18,481 --> 00:05:19,561
Go.

87
00:05:19,601 --> 00:05:21,081
Sorry.

88
00:05:21,082 --> 00:05:22,722
If you can't work, just leave.

89
00:05:27,642 --> 00:05:28,720
Get working!

90
00:05:28,721 --> 00:05:29,761
No slacking off!

91
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:30,882
Uncle.

92
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:37,100
Yilian.

93
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,141
Uncle.

94
00:05:47,241 --> 00:05:49,241
I should've visited you sooner.

95
00:05:49,863 --> 00:05:51,464
It doesn't matter.

96
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:53,282
This is who I am now.

97
00:06:00,082 --> 00:06:02,081
Uncle, don't hold it against me.

98
00:06:02,082 --> 00:06:05,120
Ever since my mother was punished
with 50 strikes and sent to the estate,

99
00:06:05,121 --> 00:06:07,001
life has been tough for Xuan and I

100
00:06:07,002 --> 00:06:08,280
in the Luo family.

101
00:06:08,281 --> 00:06:10,920
We barely get any decent meals.

102
00:06:10,921 --> 00:06:14,121
It's almost impossible
to leave the house.

103
00:06:15,082 --> 00:06:16,360
It took

104
00:06:16,361 --> 00:06:18,881
a lot of time and effort
to save up the money.

105
00:06:18,882 --> 00:06:20,402
Keep it.

106
00:06:21,241 --> 00:06:22,761
We are a family.

107
00:06:22,762 --> 00:06:24,322
Let's not talk about money.

108
00:06:24,481 --> 00:06:25,441
By the way,

109
00:06:25,442 --> 00:06:26,441
my henchman

110
00:06:26,442 --> 00:06:28,120
confessed to the crimes.

111
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:31,040
How could the Luo family still
treat you so badly?

112
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:32,681
This is outrageous.

113
00:06:33,442 --> 00:06:35,360
The people at the estate

114
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:37,240
respect authority
and look down on us.

115
00:06:37,241 --> 00:06:39,001
They won't treat my mother nicely.

116
00:06:39,002 --> 00:06:41,360
Not to mention, she suffered
a heavy injury.

117
00:06:41,361 --> 00:06:43,081
I wanted to visit her,

118
00:06:43,082 --> 00:06:44,800
but Madam Lin wouldn't let me.

119
00:06:44,801 --> 00:06:46,881
But now, she takes Luo Yining there.

120
00:06:46,882 --> 00:06:48,040
Who knows

121
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,962
what they are planning now?

122
00:06:50,241 --> 00:06:51,601
Outrageous!

123
00:06:52,601 --> 00:06:55,201
Uncle, I am scared.

124
00:06:55,202 --> 00:06:57,240
I'm scared they might
harm my mother.

125
00:06:57,241 --> 00:06:59,441
Luo Yining is cunning and cruel.

126
00:06:59,442 --> 00:07:01,641
She managed to set you up.

127
00:07:01,642 --> 00:07:02,921
I will make them pay

128
00:07:03,082 --> 00:07:05,081
for their crime.

129
00:07:05,082 --> 00:07:07,240
Go home.

130
00:07:07,241 --> 00:07:09,322
Make sure Xuan studies.

131
00:07:09,442 --> 00:07:10,920
There is still hope

132
00:07:10,921 --> 00:07:12,481
if he scores well on the exam.

133
00:07:12,601 --> 00:07:13,480
All right.

134
00:07:13,481 --> 00:07:15,521
Leave the rest to me.

135
00:07:15,522 --> 00:07:16,522
But...

136
00:07:16,842 --> 00:07:17,962
Enough.

137
00:07:18,202 --> 00:07:19,601
I must get back to work.

138
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,441
Young Lady,

139
00:07:29,442 --> 00:07:31,402
we should head back.

140
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:33,339
We should pack up

141
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,800
and head for the estate.

142
00:07:34,801 --> 00:07:36,720
Young Lady, we can't do that.

143
00:07:36,721 --> 00:07:38,240
If anyone finds out...

144
00:07:38,241 --> 00:07:40,001
We'll do so secretly.

145
00:07:40,082 --> 00:07:42,082
My mind will never be at ease

146
00:07:42,121 --> 00:07:44,282
unless I see her at the estate.

147
00:07:53,002 --> 00:07:56,001
Third Brother, we should follow
the original plan.

148
00:07:56,002 --> 00:07:57,601
One page a day.

149
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,299
Three pages. Don't be lazy.

150
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:03,761
We'll each take a step back.

151
00:08:03,762 --> 00:08:04,841
How about

152
00:08:04,842 --> 00:08:06,121
two pages a day?

153
00:08:09,281 --> 00:08:10,801
That settles it.

154
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,999
So,

155
00:08:27,002 --> 00:08:29,920
Mother is headed for the estate soon.

156
00:08:29,921 --> 00:08:32,721
I'll tag along and check
on Mistress Qiao.

157
00:08:33,241 --> 00:08:35,182
Mistress Qiao hates you to the bones.

158
00:08:35,183 --> 00:08:37,103
She will never tell you the truth.

159
00:08:40,175 --> 00:08:42,335
Do you have a plan already?

160
00:08:42,881 --> 00:08:44,762
If she is guilty of anything,

161
00:08:44,842 --> 00:08:46,841
she is bound to slip up.

162
00:08:47,768 --> 00:08:48,968
I'll go with you.

163
00:08:49,349 --> 00:08:50,469
No.

164
00:08:51,001 --> 00:08:53,762
Stay home and study.
Focus on your work here.

165
00:08:54,721 --> 00:08:57,561
I promise I will do as you say.

166
00:08:57,562 --> 00:08:59,762
I can keep myself safe.

167
00:09:00,562 --> 00:09:02,282
That settles it.

168
00:09:03,562 --> 00:09:04,480
Fine.

169
00:09:04,481 --> 00:09:05,721
I get it.

170
00:09:06,761 --> 00:09:09,201
From now on,  three pages a day.

171
00:09:09,342 --> 00:09:10,583
No negotiation.

172
00:09:10,721 --> 00:09:12,216
That settles it.

173
00:09:12,217 --> 00:09:13,337
Why you...

174
00:09:22,968 --> 00:09:24,127
Third Brother.

175
00:09:26,562 --> 00:09:29,321
The new outfit fits you like a glove.

176
00:09:30,481 --> 00:09:31,841
Many thanks, Madam Lin.

177
00:09:33,241 --> 00:09:35,522
The size fits me perfectly.

178
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,934
What are you doing here?

179
00:09:36,935 --> 00:09:38,841
You should be studying.

180
00:09:38,842 --> 00:09:41,081
I asked Madam Lin to let me tag along.

181
00:09:41,082 --> 00:09:43,441
My mother was sent to the estate.

182
00:09:43,442 --> 00:09:45,242
Her grave was there.

183
00:09:45,442 --> 00:09:46,520
This is a chance for me

184
00:09:46,521 --> 00:09:47,561
to visit the place.

185
00:09:47,562 --> 00:09:49,720
You are a filial son.

186
00:09:49,721 --> 00:09:51,041
You couldn't go there,

187
00:09:51,042 --> 00:09:52,921
so make sure you pay
your tribute to her.

188
00:09:53,241 --> 00:09:54,921
Much appreciated, Madam Lin.

189
00:10:28,121 --> 00:10:29,242
Young Lady?

190
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:35,078
Yixiu?

191
00:10:35,731 --> 00:10:37,850
My medicine works.

192
00:10:38,121 --> 00:10:39,880
You actually lost weight.

193
00:10:39,881 --> 00:10:41,281
I don't need your medicine.

194
00:10:41,282 --> 00:10:43,760
I eat radish and cabbage every day.

195
00:10:43,761 --> 00:10:46,441
How can I not lose weight?
I feel like fainting.

196
00:10:46,442 --> 00:10:49,402
You should stop taking my prescription.

197
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,081
We should never rush anything.

198
00:10:51,082 --> 00:10:52,120
Take care of yourself.

199
00:10:52,121 --> 00:10:53,360
Don't get sick.

200
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:55,482
- I should get going.
- Where are you going?

201
00:10:56,442 --> 00:10:58,480
My sister is finally leaving.

202
00:10:58,481 --> 00:11:00,120
I'm heading out and having some fun.

203
00:11:00,121 --> 00:11:02,156
Liuhe Tavern has new dishes on the menu.

204
00:11:02,157 --> 00:11:03,477
I have to try them out.

205
00:11:03,641 --> 00:11:04,880
What are the new dishes?

206
00:11:04,881 --> 00:11:05,762
Well...

207
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,602
You can't eat, so why bother asking?

208
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:13,552
Don't go!

209
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,081
You...

210
00:11:15,082 --> 00:11:16,779
Were you pretending to be sick just now?

211
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:19,019
You are still as strong as ever.

212
00:11:19,241 --> 00:11:21,041
I want to go too.

213
00:11:21,042 --> 00:11:23,179
We'd be in trouble
if your mother found out.

214
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,899
Lian Hong, escort her to her room.

215
00:11:26,202 --> 00:11:28,120
Sixth Uncle, she hasn't had

216
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:29,681
a proper meal in days.

217
00:11:29,682 --> 00:11:31,360
Mother has been

218
00:11:31,361 --> 00:11:33,000
supervising Shan's study.

219
00:11:33,001 --> 00:11:34,441
She has no time for me.

220
00:11:34,442 --> 00:11:36,360
I haven't eaten well in days.

221
00:11:36,361 --> 00:11:38,681
A meal won't harm.

222
00:11:38,682 --> 00:11:41,041
You two are too bold

223
00:11:41,042 --> 00:11:42,482
for your own good.

224
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,441
Let's go!

225
00:11:44,442 --> 00:11:46,819
No! Your mother would be furious!

226
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,707
(Liuhe Tavern)

227
00:12:01,168 --> 00:12:03,150
(Han Zhao)
Young Master, you skipped your breakfast.

228
00:12:03,151 --> 00:12:04,351
Eat up.

229
00:12:14,641 --> 00:12:16,480
Young Master, you said at the residence

230
00:12:16,481 --> 00:12:19,179
that you wanted to try
Liuhe Tavern's food.

231
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,380
What's wrong?

232
00:12:21,202 --> 00:12:22,681
I lost my appetite.

233
00:12:22,721 --> 00:12:24,441
At least take a bite or two.

234
00:12:24,442 --> 00:12:25,841
If you lost more weight,

235
00:12:25,842 --> 00:12:27,882
Her Highness would skin me alive.

236
00:12:28,641 --> 00:12:30,520
Well, don't let my mother find out.

237
00:12:30,521 --> 00:12:32,400
Tell her I'm well fed.

238
00:12:32,401 --> 00:12:33,482
Young Master.

239
00:12:33,641 --> 00:12:35,678
I wouldn't dare lie to Her Highness.

240
00:12:35,679 --> 00:12:37,599
I don't have the appetite.

241
00:12:39,823 --> 00:12:40,979
The tune sounds awful.

242
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,360
Play something more upbeat.

243
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:43,441
Yes.

244
00:12:46,802 --> 00:12:48,801
Miss, play another song.

245
00:12:48,802 --> 00:12:49,681
Yes.

246
00:12:52,601 --> 00:12:53,961
May I take your order?

247
00:12:55,082 --> 00:12:57,002
That's a lot of new dishes.

248
00:12:58,042 --> 00:13:00,040
(Roasted lamb, roasted pork)
I'll have a pigeon.

249
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,561
Then, some lamb chops.

250
00:13:01,562 --> 00:13:03,041
And a lamb leg.

251
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:04,201
Hold on.

252
00:13:04,202 --> 00:13:06,561
I can afford that much meat.

253
00:13:06,562 --> 00:13:08,281
We'll have some steamed mutton

254
00:13:08,282 --> 00:13:09,841
and two sets of fresh vegetables.

255
00:13:09,842 --> 00:13:12,041
Yes, sir. Follow me.

256
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:12,841
Come.

257
00:13:57,001 --> 00:13:59,522
I guess pigs are flying today.

258
00:14:03,202 --> 00:14:05,441
Can't we order something else?

259
00:14:05,442 --> 00:14:06,721
I want more.

260
00:14:06,761 --> 00:14:09,041
Like I said, never rush anything.

261
00:14:12,922 --> 00:14:14,041
Waiter.

262
00:14:14,601 --> 00:14:16,201
- Young Master.
- Send that lady

263
00:14:16,202 --> 00:14:17,801
a set of steamed mutton.

264
00:14:18,361 --> 00:14:19,122
Yes.

265
00:14:23,361 --> 00:14:24,681
You just served us this dish.

266
00:14:24,721 --> 00:14:26,550
Sir, the gentleman over there
ordered this

267
00:14:26,551 --> 00:14:28,190
for the young lady.

268
00:14:35,361 --> 00:14:37,000
Do you know this man?

269
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,801
Don't be silly.
Why would I know a man out here?

270
00:14:41,601 --> 00:14:43,400
Don't eat a stranger's food.

271
00:14:43,401 --> 00:14:45,480
What's wrong? It comes from
the same shop.

272
00:14:45,481 --> 00:14:47,681
I can pay him back if you want.

273
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:49,081
Waiter.

274
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:50,661
Young Master.

275
00:14:51,726 --> 00:14:53,326
Another set of steamed mutton.

276
00:14:54,442 --> 00:14:55,882
Return this.

277
00:14:56,001 --> 00:14:57,921
Another set for us. Quickly.

278
00:15:11,282 --> 00:15:13,002
Young Master, the lady

279
00:15:13,003 --> 00:15:14,723
returned the dish.

280
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:18,479
Waiter.

281
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,699
I want one set of every signature dish.

282
00:15:21,842 --> 00:15:23,482
Send them to the young lady.

283
00:15:23,962 --> 00:15:24,921
Never mind.

284
00:15:25,442 --> 00:15:27,360
We have never met.

285
00:15:27,361 --> 00:15:29,602
You may finish your own order.

286
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:31,801
The food is meant for the lady.

287
00:15:31,802 --> 00:15:33,402
It's none of your concern.

288
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,602
- Are you looking for trouble?
- Wait.

289
00:15:36,042 --> 00:15:37,640
Thank you for the kind gesture.

290
00:15:37,641 --> 00:15:39,961
But I can't finish all the food myself.

291
00:15:39,962 --> 00:15:42,520
Besides, we should share good food,

292
00:15:42,521 --> 00:15:43,921
not waste them.

293
00:15:43,922 --> 00:15:45,720
Waiter, please cancel

294
00:15:45,721 --> 00:15:47,360
- the gentleman's order.
- Yes.

295
00:15:47,361 --> 00:15:50,242
Young Master, forget it.

296
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,014
May I know your name?

297
00:15:55,015 --> 00:15:56,294
Will you come here again?

298
00:15:56,521 --> 00:15:58,242
I'd like to treat you to a meal.

299
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,419
- For real?
- You won't find us here again.

300
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,581
Let's go.

301
00:16:02,001 --> 00:16:03,081
You fool!

302
00:16:03,082 --> 00:16:04,600
Always beware of strangers.

303
00:16:04,601 --> 00:16:06,921
But doesn't strike me as a bad guy.

304
00:16:07,001 --> 00:16:09,122
How ignorant. You're hopeless.

305
00:16:28,442 --> 00:16:30,681
Had a fight with Shenyuan again?

306
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,581
I don't have time for him.

307
00:16:33,802 --> 00:16:36,242
You are throwing a childish tantrum.

308
00:16:36,842 --> 00:16:38,841
But he doesn't seem troubled.

309
00:16:39,241 --> 00:16:41,321
By the way,

310
00:16:41,802 --> 00:16:43,721
I rarely see him smile.

311
00:16:44,042 --> 00:16:46,081
I should tell him
to put on a smile

312
00:16:46,082 --> 00:16:48,602
when he visits his mother's grave.

313
00:17:04,762 --> 00:17:05,802
Hyah!

314
00:17:09,042 --> 00:17:09,961
Hyah!

315
00:17:15,082 --> 00:17:16,042
Third Brother!

316
00:17:22,161 --> 00:17:23,281
Hang on tight!

317
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:31,681
Are you hurt?

318
00:17:33,441 --> 00:17:34,562
Third Brother!

319
00:18:02,522 --> 00:18:03,921
Are you hurt, Mother?

320
00:18:06,121 --> 00:18:07,049
Third Brother!

321
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:08,169
Get out of the carriage.

322
00:18:14,722 --> 00:18:15,602
Come.

323
00:18:22,082 --> 00:18:23,201
Take it easy.

324
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:24,961
Mother!

325
00:18:40,242 --> 00:18:41,362
Third Brother!

326
00:18:45,242 --> 00:18:46,362
Are you all right?

327
00:19:03,522 --> 00:19:04,802
Hang in there.

328
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:33,896
Are you hurt?

329
00:19:52,762 --> 00:19:54,122
I was terrified.

330
00:19:56,522 --> 00:19:57,602
It's all right.

331
00:19:58,042 --> 00:19:59,681
Don't worry. I'm all right.

332
00:20:08,201 --> 00:20:09,521
You're hurt.

333
00:20:09,762 --> 00:20:10,882
It's nothing.

334
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:16,761
Why was there

335
00:20:16,762 --> 00:20:18,802
a sudden landslide?

336
00:20:19,201 --> 00:20:20,842
That was not a freak accident.

337
00:20:22,361 --> 00:20:25,042
Did Lu Jiaxue do this?

338
00:20:26,921 --> 00:20:28,322
Not Lu Jiaxue.

339
00:20:28,562 --> 00:20:29,841
If he wanted us dead,

340
00:20:29,842 --> 00:20:31,241
it'd be a lot more discreet.

341
00:20:32,103 --> 00:20:33,782
When we left the residence,

342
00:20:33,921 --> 00:20:36,281
I took a shortcut and shook them off.

343
00:20:38,441 --> 00:20:39,761
Who could this be?

344
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:58,699
Mother, are you still hurting?

345
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,380
It's all right, I can still walk.

346
00:21:01,562 --> 00:21:04,082
Madam Lin's injury is serious.
She shouldn't walk.

347
00:21:04,681 --> 00:21:06,440
We can ask the diver

348
00:21:06,441 --> 00:21:07,521
to inform the estate

349
00:21:07,522 --> 00:21:09,237
and pick us up.

350
00:21:09,238 --> 00:21:10,440
The estate is too far away.

351
00:21:10,441 --> 00:21:12,200
A round trip takes too much time.

352
00:21:12,201 --> 00:21:14,562
It's not safe after dark.

353
00:21:17,191 --> 00:21:18,472
I'll carry you.

354
00:21:29,361 --> 00:21:30,880
Seeing you carrying my mother

355
00:21:30,881 --> 00:21:33,640
- reminds me of a story.
- What story?

356
00:21:33,641 --> 00:21:35,521
A scholar's mother

357
00:21:35,522 --> 00:21:37,281
has difficulty walking.

358
00:21:37,282 --> 00:21:38,880
When he goes to school,

359
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:40,521
he carries his mother around.

360
00:21:40,562 --> 00:21:42,441
Guess what?

361
00:21:42,562 --> 00:21:45,081
His dedication moves the universe.

362
00:21:45,082 --> 00:21:46,402
He scores on every exam.

363
00:21:46,681 --> 00:21:47,802
Indeed.

364
00:21:48,441 --> 00:21:50,402
It wasn't that hard to guess the ending.

365
00:21:50,482 --> 00:21:52,241
Anyway, I believe the story.

366
00:21:52,242 --> 00:21:53,600
A caring mother and a loving son

367
00:21:53,601 --> 00:21:55,440
can move even heaven.

368
00:21:55,441 --> 00:21:58,521
From now on, you are
Third Brother's lucky star.

369
00:22:09,002 --> 00:22:09,882
Shenyuan,

370
00:22:10,242 --> 00:22:11,920
put me down.

371
00:22:11,921 --> 00:22:13,201
It's all right. I can manage.

372
00:22:19,006 --> 00:22:20,286
Madam Lin.

373
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:22,920
Madam Lin.

374
00:22:22,921 --> 00:22:24,440
Did something happen on the way here?

375
00:22:24,441 --> 00:22:26,001
You should've arrived much sooner.

376
00:22:26,002 --> 00:22:27,481
We were so worried.

377
00:22:28,482 --> 00:22:30,841
There was a landslide on our way here.

378
00:22:30,842 --> 00:22:33,440
The horse was startled
and fell off the cliff.

379
00:22:33,441 --> 00:22:34,521
Unbelievable!

380
00:22:34,522 --> 00:22:36,241
We need a healer.

381
00:22:36,242 --> 00:22:37,120
Yes.

382
00:22:37,121 --> 00:22:39,241
Stop standing there, get a healer.

383
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,140
- Yes.
- Yes.

384
00:22:41,562 --> 00:22:42,681
Follow me.

385
00:22:44,762 --> 00:22:45,602
Walk slowly.

386
00:22:50,562 --> 00:22:51,241
Hurry.

387
00:22:51,802 --> 00:22:52,481
Get moving.

388
00:23:02,921 --> 00:23:03,882
This way.

389
00:23:07,002 --> 00:23:08,761
Stop staring! Get back to work!

390
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:09,562
Mistress!

391
00:23:10,082 --> 00:23:11,640
Get back to work!

392
00:23:11,641 --> 00:23:13,921
No food for you
until you finish the work!

393
00:23:14,082 --> 00:23:15,761
You worked us to the bones.

394
00:23:15,762 --> 00:23:18,041
Each of us was doing the work of three.

395
00:23:18,042 --> 00:23:21,001
You even cut our pay for no reason!

396
00:23:21,002 --> 00:23:22,761
Have a taste of your own poison.

397
00:23:22,762 --> 00:23:23,842
Get working!

398
00:23:25,762 --> 00:23:27,134
Behave yourself.

399
00:23:29,895 --> 00:23:31,854
Has she recovered from her injury?

400
00:23:31,961 --> 00:23:33,001
Seventh Lady,

401
00:23:33,002 --> 00:23:34,761
this is not the Luo's Residence.

402
00:23:34,762 --> 00:23:36,200
We don't have good healers

403
00:23:36,201 --> 00:23:37,920
or the necessary medicine.

404
00:23:37,921 --> 00:23:39,921
I doubt her wounds have closed up.

405
00:23:40,562 --> 00:23:42,082
Karma has its ways.

406
00:23:42,361 --> 00:23:44,201
- Let's go.
- Come with me.

407
00:23:57,287 --> 00:23:58,567
Are you not mad at me anymore?

408
00:23:59,895 --> 00:24:02,175
You could've told me.

409
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:03,920
Why must you make me

410
00:24:03,921 --> 00:24:05,802
write for days on end?

411
00:24:08,161 --> 00:24:09,120
Third Young Master,

412
00:24:09,121 --> 00:24:11,001
we readied the horse you needed.

413
00:24:11,881 --> 00:24:13,001
Very well.

414
00:24:13,121 --> 00:24:14,842
Why do you need a horse?

415
00:24:14,921 --> 00:24:17,082
I'm heading out. I'll be right back.

416
00:24:18,921 --> 00:24:21,082
You can't ride a horse
with an injured hand.

417
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:22,900
I'll manage.

418
00:24:23,522 --> 00:24:24,761
Stay safe.

419
00:24:24,762 --> 00:24:25,761
I know.

420
00:24:29,482 --> 00:24:31,281
- Mistress Qiao.
- Leave it there.

421
00:24:31,282 --> 00:24:32,241
Mistress.

422
00:24:32,242 --> 00:24:34,081
Your wounds are not healing.

423
00:24:34,082 --> 00:24:35,600
This can't go on forever.

424
00:24:35,601 --> 00:24:37,041
I'll talk to the supervisor.

425
00:24:37,042 --> 00:24:38,360
You mustn't do that again.

426
00:24:38,361 --> 00:24:40,440
Be grateful that the two of us

427
00:24:40,441 --> 00:24:41,721
are still alive.

428
00:24:41,722 --> 00:24:43,521
Besides, Luo Yining is now

429
00:24:43,522 --> 00:24:45,120
in the estate.

430
00:24:45,121 --> 00:24:46,001
Mistress Qiao,

431
00:24:46,002 --> 00:24:48,001
what are they doing here?

432
00:24:48,002 --> 00:24:49,441
No idea.

433
00:24:49,641 --> 00:24:52,562
We should be careful.

434
00:24:53,042 --> 00:24:55,402
Do you think the landslide

435
00:24:55,482 --> 00:24:56,842
was Fifth Master...

436
00:24:58,762 --> 00:25:00,441
Keep it down!

437
00:25:00,762 --> 00:25:03,042
Lian isn't capable of this on her own.

438
00:25:05,121 --> 00:25:07,360
Could it be my younger brother?

439
00:25:07,361 --> 00:25:08,802
You mean

440
00:25:09,201 --> 00:25:10,322
Young Master Qiao?

441
00:25:11,361 --> 00:25:12,640
That fool!

442
00:25:12,641 --> 00:25:15,042
He just caused us more trouble.

443
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:16,960
Who is it?

444
00:25:16,961 --> 00:25:18,920
Madam Lin and the Seventh Lady
are visiting.

445
00:25:18,921 --> 00:25:21,241
The supervisor wants you
to help out in the kitchen.

446
00:25:21,242 --> 00:25:22,721
We'll be right there.

447
00:25:24,681 --> 00:25:26,841
We should avoid them
as much as we can.

448
00:25:26,842 --> 00:25:28,481
Avoid eye contact.

449
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,141
Let's go.

450
00:25:30,522 --> 00:25:32,681
Never mind. I can get up on my own.

451
00:25:38,482 --> 00:25:39,521
Third Brother.

452
00:25:39,522 --> 00:25:41,001
I got to the bottom of it.

453
00:25:41,282 --> 00:25:42,802
What took you so long?

454
00:25:43,282 --> 00:25:44,521
Where were you just now?

455
00:25:44,522 --> 00:25:45,880
Mother asked about you.

456
00:25:45,881 --> 00:25:47,882
But I managed to brush her off.

457
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:50,880
Qing Qu.

458
00:25:50,881 --> 00:25:53,281
Heat the food and bring it here.

459
00:25:53,282 --> 00:25:54,402
Yes.

460
00:25:55,201 --> 00:25:56,423
The incident

461
00:25:56,424 --> 00:25:58,319
wasn't just a landslide.

462
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,920
Someone drugged our horse.

463
00:25:59,921 --> 00:26:02,921
That was the reason
it ran amok after it was startled.

464
00:26:04,762 --> 00:26:06,082
How did you find out?

465
00:26:06,361 --> 00:26:07,440
Did you go down the cliff

466
00:26:07,441 --> 00:26:08,640
to examine the horse?

467
00:26:08,641 --> 00:26:09,761
Yes.

468
00:26:10,042 --> 00:26:11,521
I hired a local coroner

469
00:26:11,522 --> 00:26:13,122
to examine the horse's body.

470
00:26:15,601 --> 00:26:17,122
Shao'an told me

471
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,402
that Luo Yilian

472
00:26:18,441 --> 00:26:20,120
sneaked out of the house

473
00:26:20,121 --> 00:26:21,921
after we departed.

474
00:26:22,522 --> 00:26:23,761
I don't think she could

475
00:26:24,042 --> 00:26:25,241
pull this off.

476
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:27,220
She has a caring uncle.

477
00:26:27,441 --> 00:26:29,640
After Fifth Master Qiao was chased
out of the residence,

478
00:26:29,641 --> 00:26:31,241
his hatred for you and the Luo family

479
00:26:31,242 --> 00:26:32,920
became unimaginable.

480
00:26:32,921 --> 00:26:34,440
With some provocation,

481
00:26:34,441 --> 00:26:36,761
he is bound to do something reckless.

482
00:26:37,042 --> 00:26:38,920
But if it really was Fifth Master Qiao,

483
00:26:38,921 --> 00:26:40,440
he would have run away

484
00:26:40,441 --> 00:26:42,481
after knowing we were safe.

485
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:43,721
It's all right.

486
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:45,921
Shao'an is intercepting him.

487
00:26:50,441 --> 00:26:51,921
How will you ask Mistress Qiao

488
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:54,281
about your late mother?

489
00:26:55,121 --> 00:26:56,440
I was worried

490
00:26:56,441 --> 00:26:58,602
Mistress Qiao wouldn't
tell me the truth.

491
00:26:59,042 --> 00:27:00,162
But now,

492
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:01,802
with Yilian involved,

493
00:27:02,042 --> 00:27:04,921
I believe she will assist me.

494
00:27:05,441 --> 00:27:06,842
Do you need my help?

495
00:27:40,641 --> 00:27:42,402
You actually came.

496
00:27:48,722 --> 00:27:50,402
What did you do to my mother?

497
00:27:50,601 --> 00:27:52,481
You wanted to take my life.

498
00:27:52,482 --> 00:27:54,640
I came here to ask
Mistress Qiao a few questions.

499
00:27:54,641 --> 00:27:56,195
It's well within reason.

500
00:27:56,196 --> 00:27:58,237
What are you talking about?

501
00:27:58,401 --> 00:28:01,001
- You are being ridiculous.
- Stop denying it!

502
00:28:02,762 --> 00:28:05,201
Why did you sneak out
and come to the estate?

503
00:28:05,802 --> 00:28:08,281
I missed my mother.

504
00:28:08,282 --> 00:28:10,521
I came because
I was worried about her wounds.

505
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,402
Very well.

506
00:28:12,562 --> 00:28:14,241
My mother is in the estate too.

507
00:28:14,242 --> 00:28:16,081
I should tell her

508
00:28:16,082 --> 00:28:17,640
you wish to stay

509
00:28:17,641 --> 00:28:19,400
and look  after Mistress Qiao.

510
00:28:19,401 --> 00:28:20,082
No...

511
00:28:23,601 --> 00:28:25,562
This is my last warning.

512
00:28:26,562 --> 00:28:28,802
We ran into a landslide.

513
00:28:28,921 --> 00:28:30,441
Our horse was drugged.

514
00:28:30,522 --> 00:28:33,200
- Are you the culprit?
- I don't know anything.

515
00:28:33,201 --> 00:28:35,001
Don't you dare accuse me.

516
00:28:37,002 --> 00:28:38,761
If this has nothing to do

517
00:28:39,681 --> 00:28:41,842
with you...

518
00:28:43,681 --> 00:28:46,160
Then, I shall make
Mistress Qiao pay for it.

519
00:28:46,161 --> 00:28:47,761
I don't know anything!

520
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:49,362
It's...

521
00:28:49,881 --> 00:28:51,042
It's my uncle.

522
00:28:51,201 --> 00:28:52,402
It has to be him.

523
00:28:52,562 --> 00:28:54,600
My mother and I have
nothing to do with this.

524
00:28:54,601 --> 00:28:56,761
- Confess!
- Fine!

525
00:28:56,842 --> 00:28:57,961
Fine.

526
00:28:58,601 --> 00:29:02,081
I was afraid you might hurt
my mother and me.

527
00:29:02,082 --> 00:29:03,761
So, I talked to my uncle.

528
00:29:03,762 --> 00:29:05,640
I had no idea

529
00:29:05,641 --> 00:29:07,281
what he planned to do.

530
00:29:10,641 --> 00:29:11,921
So,

531
00:29:11,975 --> 00:29:13,335
you admit it.

532
00:29:14,441 --> 00:29:16,440
You instigated Fifth Master Qiao

533
00:29:16,441 --> 00:29:17,802
into attacking us.

534
00:29:21,042 --> 00:29:23,481
Qing Qu, get up.

535
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,660
Where is my mother?

536
00:29:33,921 --> 00:29:36,082
Mother, did they hurt you?

537
00:29:36,415 --> 00:29:38,255
Silly girl.

538
00:29:42,522 --> 00:29:44,041
I doubt you came here

539
00:29:44,042 --> 00:29:46,882
only to catch Lian at fault.

540
00:29:47,082 --> 00:29:49,481
Aren't you the sharp one?

541
00:29:50,223 --> 00:29:51,783
Get down to business.

542
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,480
Tell me something.

543
00:30:08,544 --> 00:30:11,144
How did my mother die?

544
00:30:11,703 --> 00:30:12,944
Your mother?

545
00:30:13,242 --> 00:30:15,162
She died from sickness.

546
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:19,900
My goodness!

547
00:30:20,002 --> 00:30:21,882
I hated her and was jealous of her,

548
00:30:21,921 --> 00:30:24,562
but I would never go as far
as taking her life.

549
00:30:24,802 --> 00:30:27,041
Your mother was strong-willed.

550
00:30:27,042 --> 00:30:29,801
By the time I found out
she had given up on Chengzhang,

551
00:30:29,802 --> 00:30:31,481
she was no longer a threat to me.

552
00:30:31,482 --> 00:30:33,441
Why would I bother to go after her?

553
00:30:33,522 --> 00:30:35,402
If you don't come clean,

554
00:30:35,681 --> 00:30:36,921
Fifth Master Qiao

555
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:38,983
and her

556
00:30:39,042 --> 00:30:40,562
are going to face

557
00:30:41,482 --> 00:30:43,082
dire consequences.

558
00:30:45,401 --> 00:30:46,920
Your mother returned to Luo's Residence

559
00:30:46,921 --> 00:30:48,281
and gave birth to you.

560
00:30:48,641 --> 00:30:50,761
Old Madam did her best
to help her reconcile

561
00:30:50,762 --> 00:30:52,082
with your father.

562
00:30:52,161 --> 00:30:54,362
Your father tried talking to her.

563
00:30:54,441 --> 00:30:56,481
It only ended with a quarrel.

564
00:30:56,601 --> 00:30:58,360
Your father felt embarrassed.

565
00:30:58,361 --> 00:31:00,362
So, he gave up on her.

566
00:31:00,522 --> 00:31:03,241
Did you think your father
loved your mother that much?

567
00:31:03,242 --> 00:31:04,801
Had she listened to Old Madam,

568
00:31:04,802 --> 00:31:06,600
things would've gone smoothly.

569
00:31:06,601 --> 00:31:07,841
It was called a reconciliation,

570
00:31:07,842 --> 00:31:08,841
but they were

571
00:31:08,842 --> 00:31:11,019
going after your mother's dowry.

572
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,600
They wanted your mother's wealth

573
00:31:12,601 --> 00:31:14,362
for his future career.

574
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,819
Father was never kind to my mother.

575
00:31:17,897 --> 00:31:20,137
Spare me your embellished stories.

576
00:31:20,201 --> 00:31:22,841
Everyone in the family knew about this.

577
00:31:22,842 --> 00:31:24,402
If you don't believe me,

578
00:31:24,441 --> 00:31:26,201
feel free to ask the others.

579
00:31:26,242 --> 00:31:27,561
But what does that

580
00:31:27,562 --> 00:31:29,761
have to do with my mother?

581
00:31:30,441 --> 00:31:32,761
I have no idea
whether it was connected or not.

582
00:31:32,762 --> 00:31:34,041
All I knew was that your mother

583
00:31:34,042 --> 00:31:36,402
embarrassed your father greatly.

584
00:31:37,042 --> 00:31:38,200
As she said,

585
00:31:38,201 --> 00:31:39,801
everything belonged to you.

586
00:31:39,802 --> 00:31:40,960
Unless she died,

587
00:31:40,961 --> 00:31:43,041
your father wouldn't get even a coin.

588
00:31:43,042 --> 00:31:44,362
And soon enough,

589
00:31:44,762 --> 00:31:46,241
she died of sickness.

590
00:31:47,482 --> 00:31:50,120
Don't give me that look.
Everything I said was true.

591
00:31:50,121 --> 00:31:52,440
I swear on my life.

592
00:31:52,441 --> 00:31:53,841
I swear

593
00:31:53,842 --> 00:31:55,441
on Lian and Xuan's lives.

594
00:32:06,522 --> 00:32:08,721
Chengzhang will never forgive me.

595
00:32:10,031 --> 00:32:11,680
I'll spend the rest of my life

596
00:32:11,681 --> 00:32:13,562
in this estate.

597
00:32:16,681 --> 00:32:19,162
If you want to know
how your mother really died,

598
00:32:20,042 --> 00:32:21,081
please forgive Lian.

599
00:32:21,082 --> 00:32:23,562
I believe she will
assist you in the future.

600
00:32:28,361 --> 00:32:29,441
Qing Qu.

601
00:32:35,042 --> 00:32:36,162
Mother!

602
00:32:36,441 --> 00:32:38,041
I overheard everything outside.

603
00:32:38,042 --> 00:32:40,219
Why did you make that oath?

604
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,340
I'm not afraid.

605
00:32:41,601 --> 00:32:43,402
Everything I said was true.

606
00:32:43,641 --> 00:32:45,362
If she wants the truth,

607
00:32:45,441 --> 00:32:47,241
let them enjoy the show.

608
00:32:47,601 --> 00:32:49,761
Was Madam Gu

609
00:32:49,762 --> 00:32:51,360
actually...

610
00:32:51,361 --> 00:32:53,042
Stay out of this.

611
00:32:54,361 --> 00:32:55,920
Coming here

612
00:32:55,921 --> 00:32:57,842
was a great mistake.

613
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,768
Focus on taking care of Xuan

614
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:01,649
and make sure he studies.

615
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:04,041
Lin Hairu has no children.

616
00:33:04,042 --> 00:33:06,201
The main wife's son
is basically useless.

617
00:33:06,522 --> 00:33:07,920
Xuan is the future

618
00:33:07,921 --> 00:33:09,842
of the Luo family.

619
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:12,029
If he scores well in the Imperial Exam,

620
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:14,110
a better life awaits us all.

621
00:33:15,161 --> 00:33:17,362
- Don't worry about it, Mother.
- I know.

622
00:33:17,872 --> 00:33:19,152
I know you care about me.

623
00:33:19,762 --> 00:33:21,162
But in a time like this,

624
00:33:21,282 --> 00:33:23,761
you must be patient and endure.

625
00:33:24,242 --> 00:33:25,441
Promise me

626
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:27,980
you will take good care of Xuan.
Is that clear?

627
00:33:28,282 --> 00:33:29,600
Don't worry.

628
00:33:29,601 --> 00:33:31,521
Xuan is in my good hands.

629
00:33:36,921 --> 00:33:38,001
It's all right.

630
00:33:44,842 --> 00:33:45,521
Hyah!

631
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,120
Fifth Master Qiao.

632
00:33:59,121 --> 00:34:00,802
We've been waiting for you.

633
00:34:03,561 --> 00:34:05,201
Please have mercy on me!

634
00:34:05,601 --> 00:34:06,761
I want you to be

635
00:34:06,762 --> 00:34:08,241
perfectly honest with me.

636
00:34:08,242 --> 00:34:10,922
If I detect even a word of lie,
you are losing your head for good!

637
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:12,899
Yes.

638
00:34:18,602 --> 00:34:20,321
Anything, Third Brother?

639
00:34:21,602 --> 00:34:23,162
Did you catch Fifth Master Qiao?

640
00:34:24,682 --> 00:34:26,562
We did.

641
00:34:27,481 --> 00:34:30,082
But he only admitted
to loosening the boulders.

642
00:34:31,521 --> 00:34:32,799
No matter how hard we pried,

643
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,279
he denied drugging the horse.

644
00:34:37,921 --> 00:34:40,162
Is it possible that he lied?

645
00:34:41,961 --> 00:34:44,281
Shao'an could finish him off right away.

646
00:34:44,642 --> 00:34:47,082
There was no need to.
Both crimes had the same result.

647
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:49,820
Perhaps

648
00:34:50,682 --> 00:34:52,082
there was another doer.

649
00:34:57,150 --> 00:34:58,510
You fear it could be him.

650
00:35:02,769 --> 00:35:04,328
Mistress Qiao

651
00:35:05,282 --> 00:35:06,761
didn't look like a liar.

652
00:35:08,282 --> 00:35:10,241
He was cold to her.

653
00:35:10,242 --> 00:35:13,082
If he finds out we are investigating,

654
00:35:13,722 --> 00:35:14,841
he might...

655
00:35:16,961 --> 00:35:19,400
I think you shouldn't
jump to the conclusion.

656
00:35:19,401 --> 00:35:21,360
Until we have incriminating evidence,

657
00:35:21,361 --> 00:35:22,841
it's just speculation.

658
00:35:23,762 --> 00:35:28,042
He is selfish but also a coward.

659
00:35:28,561 --> 00:35:31,281
It's unlike he would go after his wife

660
00:35:32,202 --> 00:35:33,562
and daughter.

661
00:35:34,361 --> 00:35:35,522
I didn't expect you

662
00:35:35,602 --> 00:35:37,641
to come to his defense.

663
00:35:37,642 --> 00:35:39,401
I'm not defending him.

664
00:35:40,481 --> 00:35:42,401
I don't want you to be in pain.

665
00:35:42,762 --> 00:35:43,761
He is still your father,

666
00:35:43,762 --> 00:35:45,641
even if you're not on
good terms with him.

667
00:35:45,642 --> 00:35:47,522
Of course you are concerned

668
00:35:47,802 --> 00:35:49,201
if he is the killer.

669
00:35:50,441 --> 00:35:52,681
I must get to the bottom of this.

670
00:35:54,001 --> 00:35:55,522
What exactly

671
00:35:55,762 --> 00:35:57,522
happened to my mother?

672
00:35:57,602 --> 00:35:58,920
Why did everyone close to her

673
00:35:58,921 --> 00:36:01,201
go into hiding and disappear?

674
00:36:01,881 --> 00:36:03,442
And Mrs. Zheng too.

675
00:36:03,602 --> 00:36:05,520
She trained Qing Qu
and sent her to me,

676
00:36:05,521 --> 00:36:07,122
but she went missing.

677
00:36:07,602 --> 00:36:09,562
What secrets are they hiding?

678
00:36:09,921 --> 00:36:11,562
Don't push yourself too hard.

679
00:36:12,441 --> 00:36:14,721
A lot has happened today.

680
00:36:14,722 --> 00:36:16,562
You need time to process this.

681
00:36:18,122 --> 00:36:19,281
Get some rest.

682
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,420
(Hu's Tomb)

683
00:36:37,531 --> 00:36:38,491
Mother.

684
00:36:40,961 --> 00:36:42,019
Madam Gu told me

685
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:43,981
you used to love osmanthus cakes.

686
00:36:45,881 --> 00:36:47,522
I brought you some.

687
00:37:17,818 --> 00:37:19,459
Thank you, Madam Lin.

688
00:37:22,881 --> 00:37:24,002
Shenyuan.

689
00:37:24,881 --> 00:37:27,442
You've been through a lot
over the years.

690
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:31,520
I'll carry you to the carriage.

691
00:37:31,521 --> 00:37:33,562
Never mind. I'm feeling better now.

692
00:37:35,162 --> 00:37:36,281
Yes.

693
00:37:37,242 --> 00:37:38,721
I'll ready the carriage.

694
00:37:39,881 --> 00:37:41,241
Take care of her.

695
00:37:47,081 --> 00:37:49,201
Mother, don't mind Third Brother.

696
00:37:49,202 --> 00:37:50,761
He has a kind heart.

697
00:37:51,162 --> 00:37:52,761
If you treat him well,

698
00:37:52,762 --> 00:37:54,881
he will return the kindness in double.

699
00:37:55,921 --> 00:37:57,681
You two are very much alike.

700
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:01,660
(Danhua Abode)

701
00:38:09,166 --> 00:38:10,287
Mother.

702
00:38:10,722 --> 00:38:11,922
Xiu.

703
00:38:12,481 --> 00:38:13,241
Come.

704
00:38:13,991 --> 00:38:16,000
The measurements will decide

705
00:38:16,001 --> 00:38:17,841
if you can have dinner later.

706
00:38:20,001 --> 00:38:21,401
If you may, Sixth Lady.

707
00:38:37,921 --> 00:38:39,761
It's an inch smaller.

708
00:38:39,762 --> 00:38:40,881
Really?

709
00:38:41,041 --> 00:38:42,522
That's a great improvement.

710
00:38:42,602 --> 00:38:43,922
Not bad.

711
00:38:44,162 --> 00:38:45,761
Keep up the good work.

712
00:38:46,242 --> 00:38:49,281
You may not be as graceful
and elegant as Yiyu,

713
00:38:49,282 --> 00:38:51,601
but you have years of practice.

714
00:38:51,602 --> 00:38:53,401
If you can lose more weight,

715
00:38:53,921 --> 00:38:55,880
given you are the main wife's daughter,

716
00:38:55,881 --> 00:38:57,922
you will get a good husband.

717
00:38:58,842 --> 00:39:00,602
But Mother,

718
00:39:00,642 --> 00:39:03,681
am I doing this
for the sake of getting married?

719
00:39:03,682 --> 00:39:05,080
Of course.

720
00:39:05,081 --> 00:39:07,040
A woman must have beauty
and womanly virtues

721
00:39:07,041 --> 00:39:09,000
to earn her in-laws' favor.

722
00:39:09,001 --> 00:39:11,520
If you give birth to a son,

723
00:39:11,521 --> 00:39:13,281
your place will be secured.

724
00:39:13,282 --> 00:39:16,082
You'll have no worries
for the rest of your life.

725
00:39:16,202 --> 00:39:17,201
But...

726
00:39:17,202 --> 00:39:19,241
But I am supposed to marry

727
00:39:19,242 --> 00:39:21,000
someone I like.

728
00:39:21,001 --> 00:39:22,161
It's annoying to live with

729
00:39:22,162 --> 00:39:23,960
someone I don't like.

730
00:39:23,961 --> 00:39:25,841
Besides, if he likes me,

731
00:39:25,842 --> 00:39:27,880
he won't mind that I am chubby.

732
00:39:27,881 --> 00:39:30,761
Who says marriage is about
being with the man you like?

733
00:39:31,162 --> 00:39:33,920
Where did you get that outrageous idea?

734
00:39:33,921 --> 00:39:35,360
What matters most for a woman

735
00:39:35,361 --> 00:39:37,343
is to marry a good husband.

736
00:39:37,344 --> 00:39:38,721
If the in-laws are powerful,

737
00:39:38,722 --> 00:39:41,241
it will benefit your father and brother.

738
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:45,400
(Marquis Anbei's Residence)

739
00:39:45,903 --> 00:39:46,822
Marquis!

740
00:39:47,202 --> 00:39:48,082
Marquis!

741
00:39:48,521 --> 00:39:49,602
Marquis!

742
00:39:49,802 --> 00:39:52,080
Chen Jiuheng's principal disciple,
Chen Daoyan, is back.

743
00:39:52,081 --> 00:39:54,241
He was spotted at Daci Temple.

744
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:55,681
I didn't want to alert him,

745
00:39:55,682 --> 00:39:57,000
so our men surrounded the temple

746
00:39:57,001 --> 00:39:58,482
from all directions.

747
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:00,241
He is on the top

748
00:40:00,242 --> 00:40:01,920
of the Imperial Guards' wanted list.

749
00:40:01,921 --> 00:40:03,721
He was lucky to have escaped.

750
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:05,761
How dare he come back?

751
00:40:06,041 --> 00:40:09,082
The retrospective period
of Chen Jiuheng's case will end soon.

752
00:40:10,081 --> 00:40:12,922
Someone has lost their patience.

753
00:40:13,802 --> 00:40:15,922
He is dooming himself
by coming back here.

754
00:40:18,081 --> 00:40:19,920
With him, we can weed out

755
00:40:19,921 --> 00:40:21,721
those hiding in the dark.

756
00:40:22,602 --> 00:40:23,922
Send the word.

757
00:40:24,242 --> 00:40:26,522
- I want him alive.
- Yes.

758
00:40:27,282 --> 00:40:28,042
Shao'an.

759
00:40:28,722 --> 00:40:30,280
- Shao'an!
- Young Master, you're back.

760
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:30,920
Go to Qi An now.

761
00:40:30,921 --> 00:40:32,241
I think Senior Daoyan is back.

762
00:40:32,242 --> 00:40:34,361
No way. He would've informed you.

763
00:40:34,441 --> 00:40:36,841
Lu Jiaxue is searching Daci Temple.

764
00:40:36,881 --> 00:40:39,002
Senior Daoyan used
to take shelter there.

765
00:40:39,881 --> 00:40:41,241
Take a sniff.

766
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:42,522
Well?

767
00:40:44,602 --> 00:40:46,000
This fragrance balm is amazing.

768
00:40:46,001 --> 00:40:47,801
The scent lingers after I wash my hands.

769
00:40:47,802 --> 00:40:50,201
- It's 20 qian each.
- I want one!

770
00:40:50,202 --> 00:40:52,761
Your rouge is different
from the others in the market.

771
00:40:52,762 --> 00:40:55,191
It gives a fair and clean complexion.

772
00:40:55,192 --> 00:40:55,992
Gather around!

773
00:40:56,282 --> 00:40:58,761
The small can is 20 qian each.

774
00:40:58,762 --> 00:41:00,241
The big one is 100 qian.

775
00:41:00,242 --> 00:41:01,480
Take the small one as a sample.

776
00:41:01,481 --> 00:41:03,080
If you like it, get the big one.

777
00:41:03,081 --> 00:41:05,962
Of course, you can always
trust Master Lin Mao's products.

778
00:41:06,401 --> 00:41:08,601
In Lin'an, as soon as they go on sale,

779
00:41:08,602 --> 00:41:09,920
the city will come for them.

780
00:41:09,921 --> 00:41:12,161
Come on. Try them out.

781
00:41:12,162 --> 00:41:12,962
Gather around!

782
00:41:13,122 --> 00:41:13,761
Have a sniff.

783
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:15,080
- It smells great.
- I want this.

784
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:17,562
- Come. Try them out.
- I want this too.

785
00:41:17,961 --> 00:41:18,681
Come on.

786
00:41:18,682 --> 00:41:20,401
Try them out.

787
00:41:20,881 --> 00:41:22,000
I want two boxes of these.

788
00:41:22,001 --> 00:41:24,321
It's sold-out? That was fast.

789
00:41:25,162 --> 00:41:26,881
Better luck next time.

790
00:41:27,041 --> 00:41:28,480
I want more of that.

791
00:41:28,481 --> 00:41:29,761
This will do the job.

792
00:41:29,762 --> 00:41:30,880
- It's sold-out!
- Sold-out.

793
00:41:30,881 --> 00:41:31,721
Yeah.

794
00:41:32,481 --> 00:41:33,880
Come on.

795
00:41:33,881 --> 00:41:35,401
- Move aside.
- Come again next time!

796
00:41:36,401 --> 00:41:37,042
Rui Xiang?

797
00:41:37,441 --> 00:41:38,640
Get a can for yourself.

798
00:41:44,762 --> 00:41:46,562
I was only away for a couple of days.

799
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:49,201
You've gotten even more brazen.

800
00:41:51,081 --> 00:41:53,360
I told you to study and prepare
for the exam.

801
00:41:53,361 --> 00:41:54,440
Sister!

802
00:41:54,441 --> 00:41:55,560
Shut it!

803
00:41:55,561 --> 00:41:56,841
Ouch!

804
00:41:57,441 --> 00:42:00,201
Take it easy, Sister!

805
00:42:11,081 --> 00:42:12,761
You neglect your study

806
00:42:13,642 --> 00:42:15,082
for this nonsense?

807
00:42:19,602 --> 00:42:22,401
The tutor said your article
was worse than hopeless.

808
00:42:22,762 --> 00:42:24,401
You should get it together!

809
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:26,540
Did you learn nothing from the books?

810
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:31,980
Do you know why I was married
into the Luo family?

811
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:36,221
I did it for your future.

812
00:42:38,242 --> 00:42:40,002
You are the only son.

813
00:42:40,842 --> 00:42:43,962
You carry the hopes
of our entire family.

814
00:42:44,881 --> 00:42:47,161
But you waste your life away
doing nothing meaningful.

815
00:42:47,162 --> 00:42:48,775
You are a disappointment!

816
00:42:48,776 --> 00:42:50,281
I know you sacrificed a lot.

817
00:42:50,282 --> 00:42:51,562
But was it for my sake?

818
00:42:51,921 --> 00:42:53,122
What do you mean?

819
00:42:53,842 --> 00:42:56,801
You are always imposing
your ideals onto me.

820
00:42:56,842 --> 00:42:59,241
I never wanted
to take the Imperial Exam.

821
00:42:59,762 --> 00:43:01,601
Why must everyone force me to do

822
00:43:01,602 --> 00:43:03,002
the things I hate?

823
00:43:10,722 --> 00:43:12,082
I dare you to say it again.

824
00:43:20,602 --> 00:43:21,721
Get out.

825
00:43:23,481 --> 00:43:24,562
Get out now!

826
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:45,339
