00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,320
(Adapted from Wen Tan's novel "Chancellor
Training Handbook" from Jinjiang Literature)

3
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:39,001
=Episode 33=

4
00:01:44,002 --> 00:01:44,803
And,

5
00:01:47,082 --> 00:01:48,082
what about this bracelet?

6
00:01:48,722 --> 00:01:49,562
Do you remember it?

7
00:02:01,002 --> 00:02:01,803
All done.

8
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,160
You spent half a day completing it.

9
00:02:09,602 --> 00:02:10,963
Seems like you're pretty bad at it.

10
00:02:11,602 --> 00:02:12,762
Speak for yourself.

11
00:02:14,203 --> 00:02:15,363
Touch this part.

12
00:02:16,483 --> 00:02:18,562
I added a lover's knot here on purpose.

13
00:02:19,483 --> 00:02:20,403
A lover's knot?

14
00:02:24,432 --> 00:02:25,440
I don't know what it is.

15
00:02:25,762 --> 00:02:26,882
What does it mean?

16
00:02:30,123 --> 00:02:31,243
Guess it yourself.

17
00:02:32,464 --> 00:02:34,320
Ever since I retrieved it
from the side yard,

18
00:02:34,736 --> 00:02:36,160
I've been wearing it all the time.

19
00:02:36,762 --> 00:02:38,162
I constantly reminded myself

20
00:02:39,562 --> 00:02:40,923
that my Mei was still alive

21
00:02:42,483 --> 00:02:43,923
and that I had to find her.

22
00:02:44,002 --> 00:02:45,923
I've never given up on finding her.

23
00:02:49,602 --> 00:02:50,403
Mei,

24
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,184
we've missed out
on each other for too long.

25
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:54,923
Return to my side.

26
00:03:05,523 --> 00:03:07,322
I've already gotten over from the past.

27
00:03:10,602 --> 00:03:12,162
It's best for you to get over it too.

28
00:03:18,496 --> 00:03:20,048
Do you wish to leave that badly?

29
00:03:20,363 --> 00:03:21,562
What are you up to again?

30
00:03:25,322 --> 00:03:26,123
Mei,

31
00:03:28,002 --> 00:03:29,123
I wish to marry you.

32
00:03:31,882 --> 00:03:33,483
Why do you always do this?

33
00:03:33,562 --> 00:03:35,002
Before, you were pretending all along.

34
00:03:35,088 --> 00:03:37,160
And now, you're trying
to steal everything from me.

35
00:03:41,002 --> 00:03:42,803
Didn't you fancy me once?

36
00:03:44,602 --> 00:03:46,722
We've been through
the harshest days together

37
00:03:47,403 --> 00:03:48,483
and kept each other

38
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:49,602
company.

39
00:03:51,344 --> 00:03:53,360
Could it be that you've fallen
for someone else?

40
00:03:58,683 --> 00:03:59,523
Is it Luo Shenyuan?

41
00:04:03,602 --> 00:04:04,722
I knew it.

42
00:04:04,963 --> 00:04:06,923
Luo Shenyuan kept
appearing in front of you

43
00:04:07,203 --> 00:04:09,403
using his brotherly status as an excuse.

44
00:04:09,882 --> 00:04:10,879
He must harbor an ulterior

45
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,064
motive for you from the start.

46
00:04:12,203 --> 00:04:13,602
Don't say that about Third Brother!

47
00:04:13,602 --> 00:04:14,923
Are you that protective of him?

48
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:16,322
It's because I fancy him.

49
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:17,522
Say that again if you dare.

50
00:04:17,762 --> 00:04:18,562
Yining?

51
00:04:18,603 --> 00:04:20,163
Yining, are you inside?

52
00:04:30,256 --> 00:04:36,176
(Wedding)

53
00:04:37,322 --> 00:04:38,123
Godbrother.

54
00:04:39,322 --> 00:04:40,402
What are you doing here?

55
00:04:40,803 --> 00:04:41,882
Where's Yining?

56
00:04:57,163 --> 00:04:58,363
Young Lady, does it hurt?

57
00:04:59,259 --> 00:05:00,339
It's already been a few days.

58
00:05:00,364 --> 00:05:01,565
Why is her ankle still swollen?

59
00:05:02,402 --> 00:05:03,882
Young Lady, seems like

60
00:05:03,882 --> 00:05:05,202
you have suffered a serious sprain.

61
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:06,800
Young Lady, I should've entered the room

62
00:05:06,825 --> 00:05:08,279
together with you back then.

63
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,120
It's the same no matter
if you were there or not.

64
00:05:10,123 --> 00:05:12,362
Lu Jiaxue plotted for it long ago.

65
00:05:12,826 --> 00:05:14,107
Hurry and dress my wound.

66
00:05:14,402 --> 00:05:15,603
Third Brother will be here soon.

67
00:05:15,603 --> 00:05:16,723
We mustn't let him see it.

68
00:05:19,522 --> 00:05:20,322
Third Brother.

69
00:05:52,762 --> 00:05:53,599
This is Sixth Uncle's

70
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,616
special ointment meant for bruises
and sprains.

71
00:05:55,882 --> 00:05:57,002
Rest for one night.

72
00:05:57,322 --> 00:05:58,363
You'll recover by tomorrow.

73
00:05:59,962 --> 00:06:01,562
How did you know that I was injured?

74
00:06:01,562 --> 00:06:03,002
I heard that you injured your ankle

75
00:06:03,202 --> 00:06:04,959
after picking flowers

76
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,224
in Marquis Anbei's Residence.

77
00:06:09,363 --> 00:06:10,723
You met Lu Jiaxue, didn't you?

78
00:06:18,402 --> 00:06:19,683
What has he done to you?

79
00:06:20,522 --> 00:06:21,762
Why did you sprain your ankle?

80
00:06:23,803 --> 00:06:24,683
Say,

81
00:06:24,752 --> 00:06:26,800
Sixth Uncle's special ointment
is effective indeed.

82
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:27,483
After this, I...

83
00:06:27,483 --> 00:06:28,882
Look into my eyes and tell me.

84
00:06:31,522 --> 00:06:33,082
What exactly happened between you two?

85
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:36,882
I'll end my affair with him

86
00:06:37,082 --> 00:06:38,479
by myself.

87
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,632
You should stay out of this.

88
00:06:39,648 --> 00:06:40,760
Want to stay out of this? Fine.

89
00:06:40,768 --> 00:06:41,480
Tell me, then.

90
00:06:42,202 --> 00:06:43,202
How will you end it?

91
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:45,803
Anyway, you're all tied up.

92
00:06:45,962 --> 00:06:47,723
I don't want you to offend him

93
00:06:47,882 --> 00:06:48,882
because of me.

94
00:06:49,322 --> 00:06:50,483
Do you think I'm worried

95
00:06:50,483 --> 00:06:51,962
about that now?

96
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,931
Lu Jiaxue and I

97
00:06:54,603 --> 00:06:55,803
are already sworn enemies.

98
00:06:56,123 --> 00:06:57,962
It's not only due to court affairs.

99
00:06:59,882 --> 00:07:00,923
It's also because of you.

100
00:07:09,483 --> 00:07:10,283
Yining.

101
00:07:14,723 --> 00:07:15,962
Do you fancy me?

102
00:07:45,355 --> 00:07:49,987
♪A glance at a fleeting bond
makes it hard to know what's next♪

103
00:07:50,882 --> 00:07:51,683
You...

104
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,706
♪Each other's hearts under the stars♪

105
00:07:55,793 --> 00:07:57,401
♪Sorrows concealed behind brows♪

106
00:07:57,483 --> 00:07:58,283
Just now, you...

107
00:08:02,123 --> 00:08:03,202
I've kept my feelings hidden

108
00:08:04,562 --> 00:08:06,002
for far too long.

109
00:08:07,322 --> 00:08:08,123
Now,

110
00:08:08,923 --> 00:08:10,363
I no longer wish to deceive myself.

111
00:08:11,962 --> 00:08:14,002
I can fancy you officially now.

112
00:08:14,923 --> 00:08:16,123
If you're willing,

113
00:08:17,212 --> 00:08:19,412
I'll head to Duke Ying's Residence

114
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:22,483
and ask for our marriage.

115
00:08:48,922 --> 00:08:50,002
Didn't I tell you already?

116
00:08:50,203 --> 00:08:51,002
No one is to enter

117
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:53,123
my study room without my permission.

118
00:08:54,203 --> 00:08:55,723
But it's First Young Lady.

119
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:10,083
Yining?

120
00:09:11,402 --> 00:09:12,203
Father.

121
00:09:12,963 --> 00:09:14,282
Why are you still awake?

122
00:09:14,464 --> 00:09:16,360
I saw that you weren't back
at this late hour.

123
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,776
That's why I came to check on you.

124
00:09:17,922 --> 00:09:19,563
I also organized

125
00:09:19,563 --> 00:09:20,483
your things for you.

126
00:09:20,928 --> 00:09:22,160
I wasn't bothering you, was I?

127
00:09:22,522 --> 00:09:23,603
Not at all.

128
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,280
It's been so long
since my room was this organized.

129
00:09:26,802 --> 00:09:27,603
This is great.

130
00:09:30,483 --> 00:09:30,682
Come.

131
00:09:32,762 --> 00:09:33,563
Look over here.

132
00:09:33,762 --> 00:09:35,762
You can read all the books on this rack

133
00:09:35,762 --> 00:09:37,203
and that rack.

134
00:09:37,402 --> 00:09:38,083
Look at this.

135
00:09:38,402 --> 00:09:39,682
My teacher wrote this.

136
00:09:44,363 --> 00:09:45,522
Why didn't Father tell you off?

137
00:09:46,603 --> 00:09:47,762
Why should Father tell me off?

138
00:09:47,824 --> 00:09:48,880
Father never allowed anyone

139
00:09:48,882 --> 00:09:50,522
to touch the things in his study room.

140
00:09:50,522 --> 00:09:52,522
He won't even let the servants
clean it casually.

141
00:09:52,522 --> 00:09:55,002
One time, Mingzhu's arrow flew inside.

142
00:09:55,002 --> 00:09:56,762
Father told her off severely.

143
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,203
But Father didn't tell you off.

144
00:09:58,402 --> 00:10:00,123
He always smiles when he sees you.

145
00:10:00,256 --> 00:10:01,320
He even acts cautiously

146
00:10:01,323 --> 00:10:02,682
in front of you.

147
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:04,516
Do you wish to know why, then?

148
00:10:06,576 --> 00:10:09,008
It's because I didn't receive
my parents' love since young.

149
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,760
Therefore, Father thinks
that he owes me a lot.

150
00:10:10,762 --> 00:10:12,162
He's trying to make it up to me.

151
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,521
Ms. Dong,

152
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,879
please take him to his room.

153
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,720
Yes, Young Lady.

154
00:10:21,282 --> 00:10:22,922
Ting, let's go.

155
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:24,963
Ms. Dong,

156
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,960
does Yining also not have a mother?

157
00:10:27,402 --> 00:10:27,963
That's right.

158
00:10:28,747 --> 00:10:30,068
Miss Yining's mother

159
00:10:30,093 --> 00:10:32,483
passed away when she was very young.

160
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,120
I guess I have it better than her, then.

161
00:10:36,483 --> 00:10:37,882
I still have Father with me,

162
00:10:39,123 --> 00:10:40,363
even though he was fierce to me.

163
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:52,481
Yining,

164
00:10:53,168 --> 00:10:54,350
we're not going to incur

165
00:10:54,388 --> 00:10:55,508
any losses this month, right?

166
00:10:56,285 --> 00:10:57,645
It's not that bad.

167
00:10:57,728 --> 00:10:59,200
However, Yanrong Pavilion's business

168
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,496
has remained relatively stagnant

169
00:11:00,724 --> 00:11:02,684
after our opening.

170
00:11:03,648 --> 00:11:04,920
That shouldn't be the case.

171
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,000
Other shops aren't selling

172
00:11:06,005 --> 00:11:07,285
the new products I invented.

173
00:11:07,724 --> 00:11:09,645
Our products are excellent indeed.

174
00:11:10,084 --> 00:11:11,724
It's just that few people

175
00:11:11,844 --> 00:11:13,285
know about our shop.

176
00:11:14,405 --> 00:11:16,125
Sixth Uncle, I was thinking

177
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,084
that the Flowers Festival is nearing.

178
00:11:18,084 --> 00:11:19,285
And, this will be my first time

179
00:11:19,285 --> 00:11:21,204
attending it as the daughter
of the Wei Family.

180
00:11:21,604 --> 00:11:23,684
If we can use this opportunity

181
00:11:23,684 --> 00:11:25,645
to introduce Yanrong Pavilion
to the public,

182
00:11:25,885 --> 00:11:27,485
it'll help our business

183
00:11:27,525 --> 00:11:28,724
to take a big leap forward.

184
00:11:28,924 --> 00:11:30,005
What do you plan to do, then?

185
00:11:37,924 --> 00:11:39,485
- You see, Yining is...
- Yining is...

186
00:11:42,684 --> 00:11:43,645
Please go ahead.

187
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:46,405
Yining

188
00:11:46,525 --> 00:11:47,924
is considerate,

189
00:11:48,084 --> 00:11:49,525
graceful, and dignified.

190
00:11:49,804 --> 00:11:51,405
She also gets along

191
00:11:51,405 --> 00:11:53,125
with everyone in the residence.

192
00:11:54,204 --> 00:11:56,084
Ola Madam Luo, it's all thanks to you

193
00:11:56,604 --> 00:11:59,525
and Madam Lin.

194
00:11:59,604 --> 00:12:02,204
Let me thank you two.

195
00:12:02,285 --> 00:12:03,724
You're too courteous.

196
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:07,285
Yining was intelligent
in the first place.

197
00:12:07,444 --> 00:12:09,084
I was lucky enough

198
00:12:09,084 --> 00:12:10,125
to keep her by my side

199
00:12:10,724 --> 00:12:12,285
for many years.

200
00:12:13,924 --> 00:12:15,285
Old Madam Wei, I can rest at ease

201
00:12:15,285 --> 00:12:16,285
upon hearing that from you.

202
00:12:16,684 --> 00:12:18,525
I was worried about her before this.

203
00:12:18,525 --> 00:12:19,844
What were you worried about?

204
00:12:21,084 --> 00:12:22,924
Were you worried
that she might be bullied?

205
00:12:23,084 --> 00:12:23,924
Not at all.

206
00:12:24,204 --> 00:12:26,525
She's your direct granddaughter
after all.

207
00:12:26,604 --> 00:12:27,405
That's right.

208
00:12:27,525 --> 00:12:28,885
Everyone tends

209
00:12:29,005 --> 00:12:30,804
to take pity on her.

210
00:12:31,285 --> 00:12:33,724
You guys don't need to worry about that.

211
00:12:34,765 --> 00:12:35,564
Don't worry.

212
00:12:36,924 --> 00:12:37,885
Old Madam Luo,

213
00:12:38,604 --> 00:12:39,924
I came here today

214
00:12:40,084 --> 00:12:41,525
to invite you

215
00:12:41,604 --> 00:12:43,525
to an event at my residence

216
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,088
that will be held in a few more days.

217
00:12:45,485 --> 00:12:46,724
An event?

218
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,324
No thanks.

219
00:12:48,324 --> 00:12:51,324
My son said he was going
to hold a Flowers Festival.

220
00:12:54,444 --> 00:12:56,285
Do you know how old I am?

221
00:12:57,084 --> 00:12:58,204
I won't be going.

222
00:12:58,525 --> 00:12:59,525
Old Madam Luo,

223
00:12:59,804 --> 00:13:01,045
this time, Yining

224
00:13:01,084 --> 00:13:02,924
will attend it

225
00:13:02,924 --> 00:13:05,405
as the eldest daughter of Duke Ying.

226
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:06,525
By then,

227
00:13:06,724 --> 00:13:08,485
she'll be the main officiant.

228
00:13:08,724 --> 00:13:12,724
That's why I'm inviting you
to the event.

229
00:13:16,204 --> 00:13:18,885
If so, I'll surely attend it.

230
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:19,765
I will.

231
00:13:20,724 --> 00:13:22,204
It's a promise, then.

232
00:13:24,105 --> 00:13:26,417
(Zhizhai Hall)

233
00:13:27,084 --> 00:13:28,604
I've already fulfilled

234
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:30,684
your task.

235
00:13:30,724 --> 00:13:32,005
Mother, don't say that.

236
00:13:32,084 --> 00:13:33,405
You'll be taking years off my life.

237
00:13:33,525 --> 00:13:34,885
What are you saying?

238
00:13:34,924 --> 00:13:37,204
Yining is my granddaughter, you know?

239
00:13:37,204 --> 00:13:39,084
I won't let her swallow any grievances.

240
00:13:39,525 --> 00:13:41,084
Mother, I knew
that you would think of it

241
00:13:41,084 --> 00:13:42,924
even if I didn't mention it to you.

242
00:13:43,724 --> 00:13:46,005
Don't flatter me too much.

243
00:13:46,045 --> 00:13:48,045
I've already made a deal

244
00:13:48,045 --> 00:13:49,645
with Old Madam Luo.

245
00:13:49,724 --> 00:13:50,724
I'll definitely back her up

246
00:13:50,724 --> 00:13:52,005
when it's necessary.

247
00:13:52,005 --> 00:13:53,084
I knew it.

248
00:13:53,084 --> 00:13:54,924
Both of you do
dote on your granddaughter.

249
00:13:55,684 --> 00:13:57,604
You may look big and burly,

250
00:13:57,924 --> 00:14:00,444
but you have a gentle heart, don't you?

251
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,564
But this child

252
00:14:03,564 --> 00:14:06,084
had been through a lot of hardships.

253
00:14:06,204 --> 00:14:07,045
Indeed.

254
00:14:07,245 --> 00:14:08,924
She was parentless since young.

255
00:14:09,525 --> 00:14:10,924
Now that she's back,

256
00:14:10,924 --> 00:14:13,125
I don't want her to swallow
any grievances.

257
00:14:13,245 --> 00:14:14,324
I can feel

258
00:14:14,324 --> 00:14:15,924
your thoughtfulness.

259
00:14:16,045 --> 00:14:17,084
Isn't that the reason

260
00:14:17,084 --> 00:14:19,684
you're spending so much effort
to hold the Flowers Festival?

261
00:14:19,804 --> 00:14:23,045
You even asked me
to invite Old Madam Luo here.

262
00:14:23,285 --> 00:14:24,485
We're there

263
00:14:24,485 --> 00:14:26,084
to quell the rumors

264
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:27,285
for her

265
00:14:27,285 --> 00:14:30,204
when it's necessary, am I right?

266
00:14:31,724 --> 00:14:33,525
That's all I can do

267
00:14:33,724 --> 00:14:35,125
for my daughter now.

268
00:14:35,525 --> 00:14:36,804
All right now.

269
00:14:37,005 --> 00:14:38,405
Weren't you busy with something?

270
00:14:38,564 --> 00:14:39,365
You should proceed.

271
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:46,684
Father.

272
00:14:48,444 --> 00:14:49,245
Yining?

273
00:14:50,485 --> 00:14:51,645
Why are you still awake?

274
00:14:52,204 --> 00:14:54,285
I saw that you were still reading
at this late hour.

275
00:14:54,724 --> 00:14:56,525
Therefore, I made you a bowl of noodles.

276
00:14:58,724 --> 00:15:00,245
Did you cook it yourself?

277
00:15:02,084 --> 00:15:03,084
I rarely cook.

278
00:15:03,084 --> 00:15:04,924
I don't know if it's good or not.

279
00:15:05,324 --> 00:15:06,924
It'll surely be good.

280
00:15:07,285 --> 00:15:09,084
Father, you haven't tried it yet.

281
00:15:09,525 --> 00:15:10,885
It looks good to me.

282
00:15:12,084 --> 00:15:13,405
Father, please try it.

283
00:15:18,045 --> 00:15:18,844
It's delicious.

284
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,080
Senior Yang requested an imperial
decree to investigate the smuggling?

285
00:15:46,084 --> 00:15:47,084
That's the kind of person

286
00:15:47,444 --> 00:15:48,285
he is.

287
00:15:48,645 --> 00:15:49,604
He's impatient.

288
00:15:49,691 --> 00:15:51,370
(Benevolence and Kindness)

289
00:15:55,285 --> 00:15:57,724
Is there anything else
you wish to tell me?

290
00:16:01,924 --> 00:16:02,765
Master, I'm worried

291
00:16:02,765 --> 00:16:04,684
that he might alert them to our presence

292
00:16:05,645 --> 00:16:06,885
with his impatient demeanor.

293
00:16:08,285 --> 00:16:09,444
I understand what you mean.

294
00:16:14,204 --> 00:16:15,604
But Yang Ling

295
00:16:15,856 --> 00:16:18,040
is too righteous and straightforward
for his own good.

296
00:16:18,285 --> 00:16:19,844
If he wishes to investigate something,

297
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:21,324
no one can stop him.

298
00:16:21,444 --> 00:16:22,804
There's no need to add

299
00:16:22,804 --> 00:16:23,604
any unnecessary losses

300
00:16:23,604 --> 00:16:25,525
because of his righteous
and hot-blooded demeanor.

301
00:16:25,885 --> 00:16:26,684
Therefore,

302
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:28,285
if he succeeds,

303
00:16:29,045 --> 00:16:30,045
we shall aid him.

304
00:16:30,405 --> 00:16:31,444
If he doesn't,

305
00:16:32,256 --> 00:16:33,920
we shall do our best to aid him as well.

306
00:16:38,405 --> 00:16:39,485
I understand.

307
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:46,724
Tell your men to tail
Vice Minister Yang in secret.

308
00:16:46,924 --> 00:16:47,924
No mistakes are allowed.

309
00:16:48,245 --> 00:16:50,045
Young Master, do you wish
to aid Official Yang?

310
00:16:50,405 --> 00:16:51,679
He resembles Senior Daoyan.

311
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,016
Although they're righteous and upright,
they're impulsive.

312
00:16:54,032 --> 00:16:55,320
Try your best to ensure his safety.

313
00:16:55,365 --> 00:16:56,165
Yes, Young Master.

314
00:16:57,285 --> 00:16:58,204
Third Brother?

315
00:17:02,924 --> 00:17:03,724
Young Lady Sun.

316
00:17:03,885 --> 00:17:05,045
You and I aren't strangers.

317
00:17:05,045 --> 00:17:06,525
Why are you always this courteous?

318
00:17:06,604 --> 00:17:08,285
Can't you do what the seniors do

319
00:17:08,285 --> 00:17:09,525
and address me as Congwan?

320
00:17:09,744 --> 00:17:11,248
I think we should observe the rites.

321
00:17:12,704 --> 00:17:14,840
Third Brother, it's been a long time
since you came back.

322
00:17:14,844 --> 00:17:17,084
You should stay here for
a few more days.

323
00:17:17,084 --> 00:17:18,685
I shall not bother you guys this time.

324
00:17:18,725 --> 00:17:20,525
I have things I need to attend to.

325
00:17:21,168 --> 00:17:22,440
I shall take my leave for now.

326
00:17:34,925 --> 00:17:37,445
Chancellor Wang,
what are you doing here personally?

327
00:17:37,725 --> 00:17:40,205
You could've sent your men here
to notify me.

328
00:17:45,285 --> 00:17:46,725
You're busy with plenty of affairs.

329
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:48,725
You have to take care

330
00:17:49,045 --> 00:17:50,525
of Yanrong Pavilion's business

331
00:17:51,685 --> 00:17:54,084
and request decrees for the daughter

332
00:17:54,084 --> 00:17:55,644
of Duke Ying.

333
00:17:57,324 --> 00:17:59,404
It's difficult enough for us

334
00:18:00,364 --> 00:18:01,164
to arrange a meeting.

335
00:18:01,725 --> 00:18:02,525
Therefore,

336
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:05,285
I had no choice but to visit you

337
00:18:06,032 --> 00:18:07,120
and wait for you personally.

338
00:18:11,984 --> 00:18:13,872
Chancellor Wang, you must be joking.

339
00:18:14,224 --> 00:18:15,552
Duke Ying found his daughter.

340
00:18:16,005 --> 00:18:17,644
That's an occasion worth celebrating.

341
00:18:18,084 --> 00:18:19,804
I was just sending them
a celebratory gift.

342
00:18:23,045 --> 00:18:24,925
Marquis Lu, I don't think

343
00:18:25,245 --> 00:18:26,644
that's your only goal.

344
00:18:27,884 --> 00:18:30,404
Don't tell me you wish to be

345
00:18:30,925 --> 00:18:32,525
Duke Ying's son-in-law?

346
00:18:38,404 --> 00:18:39,205
Chancellor Wang.

347
00:18:43,525 --> 00:18:44,844
If I do become

348
00:18:44,844 --> 00:18:46,124
Duke Ying's son-in-law,

349
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:47,404
wouldn't it be

350
00:18:48,245 --> 00:18:49,725
more convenient for us

351
00:18:50,124 --> 00:18:51,445
to act in the future?

352
00:18:54,324 --> 00:18:56,525
Wei Ling isn't Song Yingshan, you know?

353
00:18:57,124 --> 00:18:59,925
He has already intervened
in the tea tax case.

354
00:19:00,324 --> 00:19:02,324
He's already our enemy.

355
00:19:03,124 --> 00:19:04,445
You cannot resolve this issue

356
00:19:05,245 --> 00:19:06,685
with marriage alone.

357
00:19:10,084 --> 00:19:11,485
Chancellor Wang,

358
00:19:12,604 --> 00:19:13,685
I suppose you're here

359
00:19:14,205 --> 00:19:16,245
to discuss Yang Ling's departure
to the coast, right?

360
00:19:18,005 --> 00:19:20,485
After Duke Ying had visited
the Yang's Residence,

361
00:19:20,485 --> 00:19:21,604
Yang Ling started

362
00:19:21,604 --> 00:19:23,925
to investigate the tea tax case.

363
00:19:24,084 --> 00:19:26,005
He's merely
the Vice Minister of Revenue.

364
00:19:26,005 --> 00:19:27,525
Where did he get the courage to do so?

365
00:19:28,685 --> 00:19:30,404
Seems like Duke Ying

366
00:19:30,404 --> 00:19:31,525
has joined hands with Sun Jie.

367
00:19:32,884 --> 00:19:33,685
Chancellor Wang,

368
00:19:34,685 --> 00:19:37,685
Sun Jie always had differing opinions

369
00:19:37,685 --> 00:19:39,525
as opposed to yours in court.

370
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:43,205
Seems like he's getting impatient.

371
00:19:44,445 --> 00:19:47,525
He's just relying on the fact
that he was the imperial tutor.

372
00:19:48,644 --> 00:19:51,084
But in fact, they're just
a group of pedantic scholars.

373
00:19:51,925 --> 00:19:54,925
I'm just worried that he might
form his own faction

374
00:19:55,685 --> 00:19:56,804
and grow in power.

375
00:19:57,884 --> 00:19:59,005
We have to be wary of them.

376
00:19:59,005 --> 00:20:00,844
If so, try and plant a spy

377
00:20:01,285 --> 00:20:03,604
within their ranks.

378
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,800
Chancellor Wang, do you
have a suitable candidate in mind?

379
00:20:07,844 --> 00:20:10,084
Luo Shenyuan, the triple top scorer,

380
00:20:10,644 --> 00:20:12,445
he's his student as well, right?

381
00:20:12,624 --> 00:20:14,520
He's been making a name
for himself lately.

382
00:20:15,324 --> 00:20:17,525
What do you think about him?

383
00:20:20,685 --> 00:20:22,084
He's a talented individual indeed.

384
00:20:22,925 --> 00:20:25,205
Even His Majesty was praising him.

385
00:20:28,604 --> 00:20:29,925
Write to our men in Quanzhou

386
00:20:30,124 --> 00:20:32,685
and tell them to take early precautions.

387
00:20:33,844 --> 00:20:34,644
Chancellor Wang.

388
00:20:36,304 --> 00:20:38,200
Yang Ling is investigating
the tea tax case

389
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:40,685
under imperial decree.

390
00:20:41,925 --> 00:20:44,039
It would be inappropriate for us

391
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,168
to evade and deceive him.

392
00:20:46,124 --> 00:20:48,324
What do you think we should do, then?

393
00:20:50,844 --> 00:20:54,084
I think all the officials in Quanzhou

394
00:20:54,925 --> 00:20:56,685
should strive
to cooperate with each other.

395
00:21:01,525 --> 00:21:02,404
All right.

396
00:21:02,525 --> 00:21:04,525
We can proceed according to your plan.

397
00:21:05,205 --> 00:21:06,005
Yes, sir.

398
00:21:07,008 --> 00:21:08,000
Chancellor Wang, please.

399
00:21:17,725 --> 00:21:19,525
Please head there personally.

400
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,752
Please hand this letter to him

401
00:21:21,045 --> 00:21:22,245
after meeting up with him.

402
00:21:23,045 --> 00:21:25,005
Wang Yuan's men will surely act.

403
00:21:25,205 --> 00:21:26,685
Please protect him.

404
00:21:27,005 --> 00:21:28,005
and yourselves as well.

405
00:21:28,604 --> 00:21:29,404
Understood.

406
00:21:36,205 --> 00:21:38,205
Here's the 12 Flowers Fragrance
you requested.

407
00:21:44,245 --> 00:21:46,124
The delicate fragrance lingers
for a long time.

408
00:21:46,205 --> 00:21:47,245
Other shops

409
00:21:47,245 --> 00:21:48,685
can't compare to us indeed.

410
00:21:48,685 --> 00:21:50,045
Sixth Uncle, you're incredible.

411
00:21:50,404 --> 00:21:51,324
Of course.

412
00:21:51,324 --> 00:21:53,084
You don't know how troublesome
it is to make it.

413
00:21:53,084 --> 00:21:54,199
I used an entire cart

414
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,112
of fresh flowers
to make a small vial like this.

415
00:21:56,205 --> 00:21:57,285
How do you plan to sell it?

416
00:21:57,925 --> 00:21:59,844
I plan to deliver this
to all the noble ladies

417
00:21:59,844 --> 00:22:01,445
as a gift.

418
00:22:01,525 --> 00:22:02,324
As a gift?

419
00:22:02,685 --> 00:22:03,525
This won't do.

420
00:22:03,604 --> 00:22:05,205
You don't understand
how precious it is.

421
00:22:05,245 --> 00:22:06,685
The ladies in the capital

422
00:22:06,685 --> 00:22:07,844
imitate the noble ladies when it

423
00:22:07,925 --> 00:22:09,525
comes to food, clothing,
and necessities.

424
00:22:09,525 --> 00:22:11,039
If we can make

425
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,400
the noble ladies like our fragrance

426
00:22:12,448 --> 00:22:13,640
during the Flowers Festival,

427
00:22:13,644 --> 00:22:15,485
it'll definitely help Yanrong Pavilion

428
00:22:15,485 --> 00:22:16,604
to garner a great reputation.

429
00:22:17,445 --> 00:22:18,685
If so, you have to use it wisely.

430
00:22:19,525 --> 00:22:21,485
It's just
that we haven't come up with a name

431
00:22:21,485 --> 00:22:22,685
for these.

432
00:22:22,685 --> 00:22:23,804
If each vial

433
00:22:23,804 --> 00:22:25,005
could have a name,

434
00:22:25,005 --> 00:22:27,084
it could certainly
convey an elegant charm.

435
00:22:27,245 --> 00:22:29,285
I'm not good at coming up with names.

436
00:22:29,952 --> 00:22:31,744
Why don't we seek Shenyuan's help?

00:23:21,725 --> 00:23:22,765
What are you doing here?

442
00:23:22,765 --> 00:23:24,884
Shouldn't you be waiting for me
outside the courtyard?

443
00:23:28,564 --> 00:23:29,485
All right. I got it.

444
00:23:43,485 --> 00:23:44,285
Third Brother!

445
00:23:45,205 --> 00:23:45,965
Third Brother!

Third Brother!

447
00:23:54,525 --> 00:23:55,725
Why has he vanished?

448
00:23:57,984 --> 00:23:59,824
Did you pull a trick on me on purpose?

449
00:23:59,856 --> 00:24:00,800
I said I got it.

450
00:24:00,804 --> 00:24:02,045
I didn't say I was leaving.

451
00:24:03,884 --> 00:24:05,245
What's inside this box?

452
00:24:06,224 --> 00:24:07,480
Uncle said the 12 fragrances

453
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,072
made of flowers haven't been named yet.

454
00:24:09,205 --> 00:24:10,119
Therefore, I came up

455
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,680
with 12 names on the wooden plaques.

456
00:24:11,965 --> 00:24:13,045
Thank you, Third Brother.

457
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:17,205
What's inside that wooden box, then?

458
00:24:22,164 --> 00:24:24,205
These flowers look real,

459
00:24:24,364 --> 00:24:25,404
but they're not.

460
00:24:25,485 --> 00:24:27,205
They look just like the real ones.

461
00:24:27,205 --> 00:24:28,205
Did you make these?

462
00:24:29,404 --> 00:24:30,124
It's a secret.

463
00:24:30,445 --> 00:24:31,765
Anyway, I've prepared them for you.

464
00:24:31,765 --> 00:24:33,285
Pick one. I'll help you to put it on.

465
00:24:36,485 --> 00:24:37,485

the flowers should be ashamed
to adorn the old man's head instead."

482
00:25:34,624 --> 00:25:35,960
Mr. Dongpo had an open mind.

483
00:25:36,045 --> 00:25:37,844
You should learn from him.

484
00:25:39,245 --> 00:25:40,644
You've improved, haven't you?

485
00:25:40,804 --> 00:25:42,045

494
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,392
The two people who boarded the ship,

495
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:28,800
are they Wang Yuan's trusted aides?

496
00:26:28,965 --> 00:26:29,804
Indeed.

497
00:26:33,364 --> 00:26:33,965
Over here.

498
00:26:35,925 --> 00:26:36,804
They're over here.

499
00:26:38,525 --> 00:26:39,445
Take a look.

500
00:26:40,224 --> 00:26:41,160
All of them are here.

00:28:45,404 --> 00:28:46,324
Who murdered them?

511

I promise

514
00:28:52,485 --> 00:28:54,285
that I won't tell anyone
about our dirty deeds!

515
00:28:54,285 --> 00:28:55,404
Nonsense!

516
00:28:55,445 --> 00:28:56,844
- This is...
- Great.

517
00:28:57,285 --> 00:28:58,965
Yang Ling, the Vice Minister of Revenue,

518
00:28:59,364 --> 00:29:01,005
is guilty of good smuggling and murder!

519
00:29:01,248 --> 00:29:02,800
We have concrete evidence of your crime!

520
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,704

and evidence of your crime!

526
00:29:27,245 --> 00:29:28,045
Take his body away.

are you sure they're dead?

Yes, sir.

536
00:30:25,664 --> 00:30:27,088
Report this to His Majesty immediately.

Yang Ling, the Vice Minister of Revenue,
smuggled tea leaves,

538
00:30:30,752 --> 00:30:32,240
silenced the witnesses of his crime,

539
00:30:32,245 --> 00:30:33,445
and escaped.

540
00:30:33,884 --> 00:30:34,404
Yes, sir.

542
00:30:41,124 --> 00:30:41,765

543
00:30:43,152 --> 00:30:44,944
There are flowers over there as well.

544
00:30:46,045 --> 00:30:46,965
They look great.

00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,729
I've been
staying in Yanrong Pavilion

547
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:05,560
to manage our business.

548
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,312
I had no time
to return to the Luo's Residence.

549
00:31:07,604 --> 00:31:08,404
You...

550
00:31:09,245 --> 00:31:10,324
Did you miss me?

551
00:31:11,485 --> 00:31:13,285
Why should I miss you?

552
00:31:13,285 --> 00:31:14,804
I'm your future husband, you know?

553
00:31:14,844 --> 00:31:16,564
We haven't discussed
the marriage proposal yet.

554
00:31:16,644 --> 00:31:18,164
Who said you're my husband?

555
00:31:19,844 --> 00:31:21,045
Give me one year.

556
00:31:21,245 --> 00:31:22,404
I'll help out more people

557
00:31:22,404 --> 00:31:23,525
with my prescriptions.

558
00:31:23,568 --> 00:31:24,816
Rescue the dying and heal the wounded.

559
00:31:24,816 --> 00:31:25,800
And turn Yanrong Pavilion

560
00:31:25,808 --> 00:31:27,280
into the state's top rouge shop.

561
00:31:27,364 --> 00:31:29,285
I'll open ten branches
all over the world.

562
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,232
After that, I'll hold
a glorious wedding for you.

563
00:31:31,712 --> 00:31:33,632
Don't say that.
There are other people around.

564
00:31:33,664 --> 00:31:34,240
It's fine.

565
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,369
The ladies are having tea

566
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:36,670
and chatting in the flower pavilion.

567
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:38,304
All the gentlemen
are drinking and chatting

568
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,088
at the front yard.

569
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,448
Only the two of us are here.

570
00:31:42,084 --> 00:31:43,205
What are you doing?

571
00:31:43,424 --> 00:31:44,840
You should return to the front yard.

572
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,350
I need to return to the flower pavilion.

573
00:31:46,352 --> 00:31:47,888
We shouldn't meet each other in secret

574
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:48,816
like this.

575
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:58,581
(Gathering of Flowers)

576
00:32:10,685 --> 00:32:12,084
The Seventh Lady of the Luo Family

577
00:32:12,084 --> 00:32:13,005
has suddenly become

578
00:32:13,005 --> 00:32:14,965
Duke Ying's legitimate
eldest daughter, huh?

579
00:32:15,685 --> 00:32:16,804
This is interesting indeed.

580
00:32:17,285 --> 00:32:18,525
Seventh Lady is just a wild lass

581
00:32:18,525 --> 00:32:20,285
who grew up away from the residence.

582
00:32:20,525 --> 00:32:22,084
Nobody knew what had happened.

583
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,432
Could it be that she was
sent to Duke Ying's Residence,

584
00:32:24,765 --> 00:32:26,124
just like Young Lady Mingzhu?

585
00:32:38,844 --> 00:32:40,324
Old Madam Luo, you're here.

586
00:32:41,644 --> 00:32:42,604
Welcome.

587
00:32:42,604 --> 00:32:43,485
Please have a seat.

588
00:32:43,604 --> 00:32:44,245
Okay.

589
00:32:44,485 --> 00:32:45,124
Please.

590
00:32:54,205 --> 00:32:55,245
Old Madam Luo.

591
00:32:55,685 --> 00:32:57,965
The entire courtyard
is filled with blooming flowers.

592
00:32:57,965 --> 00:32:59,765
Aren't they gorgeous?

593
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:01,644
I did see it.

594
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:03,900
I saw the colorful array of flowers
after entering the residence.

595
00:33:03,904 --> 00:33:05,880
All the most beautiful flowers
in the capital

596
00:33:05,884 --> 00:33:07,604
can be found here.

597
00:33:08,965 --> 00:33:10,604
Yining, come here.

598
00:33:14,285 --> 00:33:16,564
Yining, you've been well-raised
all these years

599
00:33:16,685 --> 00:33:18,525
all thanks to your Grandma Luo.

600
00:33:18,752 --> 00:33:20,784
Your mother passed away
when you were very young.

601
00:33:20,804 --> 00:33:23,404
Your father was stationed
at the borders all year long as well.

602
00:33:23,525 --> 00:33:25,324
It's all because
we're close to each other.

603
00:33:25,564 --> 00:33:28,005
And, I admire

604
00:33:28,005 --> 00:33:30,084
the Luo Family's century-old teachings.

605
00:33:30,404 --> 00:33:32,844
That's why I entrusted her to you.

606
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,884
If not, you wouldn't be as outstanding

607
00:33:34,884 --> 00:33:36,765
as you are today.

608
00:33:37,604 --> 00:33:39,725
We've been best friends for many years.

609
00:33:39,765 --> 00:33:41,765
What are you saying?

610
00:33:43,485 --> 00:33:44,604
Yining

611
00:33:44,804 --> 00:33:46,844
was born clever and adorable.

612
00:33:46,965 --> 00:33:48,525
She would be outstanding

613
00:33:49,084 --> 00:33:50,685
no matter who raises her.

614
00:33:51,765 --> 00:33:53,765
If not, His Majesty wouldn't be

615
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:55,324
this fond of her.

616
00:33:55,364 --> 00:33:57,124
He even made her a county princess.

617
00:34:00,912 --> 00:34:02,880
His Majesty actually
made her a county princess?

618
00:34:02,925 --> 00:34:05,364
His Majesty only did so
on account of Duke Ying.

619
00:34:05,472 --> 00:34:07,312
Do you think
the legitimate daughter of the Duke

620
00:34:07,344 --> 00:34:08,752
can be raised away from the residence?

621
00:34:08,925 --> 00:34:10,805
No matter why His Majesty did so,

622
00:34:10,845 --> 00:34:12,965
he did make her a county princess.

623
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,808
How can we make casual remarks
about His Majesty's decisions?

624
00:34:16,805 --> 00:34:17,604
Shen,

625
00:34:18,164 --> 00:34:19,644
you should stop talking.

626
00:34:21,724 --> 00:34:23,284
The ceremony is nearing.

627
00:34:23,284 --> 00:34:23,885
Ladies,

628
00:34:23,885 --> 00:34:25,525
it's time to move outside.

629
00:34:26,164 --> 00:34:26,965
All right.

630
00:34:27,204 --> 00:34:28,525
You guys can go ahead.

631
00:34:28,805 --> 00:34:30,124
I shall take my leave.

632
00:34:38,204 --> 00:34:39,005
Young Lady Zhao.

633
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:42,120
Fate does like
playing tricks on people, huh?

634
00:34:42,405 --> 00:34:44,005
Wei Yining appeared out of nowhere.

635
00:34:44,325 --> 00:34:46,005
If not, you would've been

636
00:34:46,164 --> 00:34:48,244
the main officiant of the ceremony.

637
00:35:02,164 --> 00:35:04,204

the east wind brings warmth,

Then comes the lotus, unstained,

649

and finally, the chrysanthemum
that does not wither.

650

688
00:37:59,405 --> 00:38:00,724

or drink in the flower pavilion
as they like.

690
00:38:03,525 --> 00:38:04,845
Just let them be.

691
00:38:05,485 --> 00:38:06,764
We might be restraining them

692
00:38:06,764 --> 00:38:08,365
if we're there.

693
00:38:08,885 --> 00:38:11,564
Old Madam Wei,
you're considerate indeed.

694
00:38:12,885 --> 00:38:13,405
Please.

695
00:38:13,405 --> 00:38:13,845
All right.

696
00:38:16,644 --> 00:38:18,319
Yiyu, you're already pregnant?

697
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,856
Yeah. But her pregnancy
isn't stable yet.

698
00:38:19,856 --> 00:38:21,100
That's why she's not coming today.

699
00:38:21,152 --> 00:38:22,400
She told me to apologize to you.

700
00:38:22,764 --> 00:38:23,965
What are you saying?

701
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,400
I need to head back
and prepare a red packet for her now.

702
00:38:27,005 --> 00:38:27,764
Young Lady,

703
00:38:28,764 --> 00:38:30,485
I've brought you
the things you requested.

704
00:38:32,405 --> 00:38:33,445
Why do these silk flowers

705
00:38:33,445 --> 00:38:34,805
smell like actual flowers?

706
00:38:35,445 --> 00:38:36,325
You're right.

707
00:38:36,445 --> 00:38:38,325
This is osmanthus, this is hibiscus,

708
00:38:38,325 --> 00:38:39,325
and this is orchid.

709
00:38:40,005 --> 00:38:41,485
The silk flowers have a stronger scent

710
00:38:41,604 --> 00:38:43,005
than fresh flowers.

711
00:38:43,005 --> 00:38:44,045
This is a fragrance.

712
00:38:44,925 --> 00:38:46,485
A fragrance? What is that?

713
00:38:46,485 --> 00:38:47,244
A fragrance

714
00:38:47,284 --> 00:38:48,564
is made of fresh flowers.

715
00:38:48,564 --> 00:38:50,084
Young Lady Wei

716
00:38:50,445 --> 00:38:52,644
has achieved stardom overnight, huh?

717
00:38:53,485 --> 00:38:54,164
It smells great.

718
00:38:54,592 --> 00:38:55,440
Let me take a sniff.

719
00:38:55,604 --> 00:38:56,564
Come, ladies.

720
00:38:56,564 --> 00:38:57,525
I'll show it to you guys.

721
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,360
These are the fragrances.

722
00:38:59,764 --> 00:39:01,204
We drip them on the silk flowers...

723
00:39:01,204 --> 00:39:02,005
Seventh Lady.

724
00:39:02,816 --> 00:39:04,280
I should address you as Young Lady Wei.

725
00:39:04,564 --> 00:39:05,764
It feels awkward

726
00:39:05,925 --> 00:39:07,365
as I'm not used to it yet.

727
00:39:10,485 --> 00:39:11,445
It's fine.

728
00:39:11,764 --> 00:39:13,564
If you guys don't mind,

729
00:39:13,564 --> 00:39:15,045
you guys can address me by my name.

730
00:39:16,564 --> 00:39:19,405
Yining, what's with the fragrant scent?

731
00:39:19,845 --> 00:39:21,204
It's because of the fragrances.

732
00:39:21,284 --> 00:39:23,045
These are made

733
00:39:23,164 --> 00:39:24,485
with the essence of flowers.

734
00:39:24,485 --> 00:39:26,204
If you drip one drop
on your handkerchief,

735
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:28,244
you'll leave a fragrant trail behind.

736
00:39:28,405 --> 00:39:30,399
And, the scent will last for a few days.

737
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,048
So, such a magical item does exist, huh?

738
00:39:32,764 --> 00:39:35,005
Yanrong Pavilion invented them.

739
00:39:35,005 --> 00:39:37,084
I spent a lot of effort
just to procure them.

740
00:39:37,204 --> 00:39:38,124
Yanrong Pavilion?

741
00:39:38,325 --> 00:39:39,564
I think I've heard of it before.

742
00:39:39,885 --> 00:39:41,279
It's a new shop.

743
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,864
Let's check that place out next time.

744
00:39:42,992 --> 00:39:43,400
Come.

745
00:39:43,405 --> 00:39:45,164
You all should give it a try.

746
00:39:48,256 --> 00:39:49,696
I'll give it a try too.

747
00:39:49,805 --> 00:39:50,564
Mingzhu, here.

748
00:39:54,925 --> 00:39:56,164
It does smell nice.

749
00:39:56,965 --> 00:39:59,164
Mingzhu, take a sniff
and guess what it is.

750
00:40:04,644 --> 00:40:06,405
As the shadows dance to greet the sun,

751
00:40:06,564 --> 00:40:08,445
the fragrance subtly wafts
towards people.

752
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,488
This is a fragrance made with hibiscus.

753
00:40:13,124 --> 00:40:14,405
Mingzhu, you're smart indeed.

754
00:40:14,485 --> 00:40:16,445
You can have this as a gift, then.

755
00:40:17,564 --> 00:40:18,925
Thank you, Yining.

756
00:40:19,405 --> 00:40:20,325
It smells great.

757
00:40:20,485 --> 00:40:21,644
I want to buy a set as well.

758
00:40:21,965 --> 00:40:23,365
It's not for sale yet.

759
00:40:23,365 --> 00:40:24,764
All of these are samples.

760
00:40:24,764 --> 00:40:26,084
If you like them,

761
00:40:26,084 --> 00:40:27,445
you all may take these samples.

762
00:40:28,525 --> 00:40:29,445
Sure.

763
00:40:29,445 --> 00:40:30,845
Let me take a look.

764
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,045
- I'll pick one.
- I'll take it.

765
00:40:32,045 --> 00:40:32,764
I'll take this.

766
00:40:33,485 --> 00:40:34,325
Mine smells nice.

767
00:40:34,325 --> 00:40:34,644
Here.

768
00:40:35,084 --> 00:40:35,925
Is it this one?

769
00:40:38,084 --> 00:40:39,124
This smells great too.

770
00:40:39,124 --> 00:40:40,164
It smells superb.

771
00:40:41,405 --> 00:40:42,805
Duke Ying wasn't in the mood

772
00:40:42,805 --> 00:40:45,005
to hold the Flowers Festival
in the past few years.

773
00:40:45,124 --> 00:40:46,604
This year, he actually held it

774
00:40:46,604 --> 00:40:48,284
for Young Lady Yining's sake.

775
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,336
That's not strange at all.

776
00:40:50,965 --> 00:40:52,084
Father will come up

777
00:40:52,445 --> 00:40:53,885
with a way
to pluck the moon for her

778
00:40:54,244 --> 00:40:55,204
if she demands it

779
00:40:55,204 --> 00:40:56,164
from him.

780
00:40:56,805 --> 00:40:58,445
And, look at all those noble ladies.

781
00:40:58,644 --> 00:40:59,405
They were

782
00:40:59,405 --> 00:41:01,124
revolving around you before this.

783
00:41:01,485 --> 00:41:02,604
But today,

784
00:41:02,604 --> 00:41:04,365
Young Lady Wei was the star of the show.

785
00:41:05,325 --> 00:41:08,084
They're used to flattering those
above and despising those below.

786
00:41:09,525 --> 00:41:11,925
Now, I've finally
seen their true colors.

787
00:41:12,485 --> 00:41:14,764
Young Lady, I'm worried about you.

788
00:41:15,084 --> 00:41:16,284
If this keeps up,

789
00:41:16,525 --> 00:41:18,325
your position in the residence

790
00:41:18,445 --> 00:41:20,204
will get more and more awkward.

791
00:41:20,204 --> 00:41:21,124
Stop it.

792
00:41:22,885 --> 00:41:23,684
Let's go.

793
00:41:42,045 --> 00:41:42,764
Sixth Lady,

794
00:41:43,005 --> 00:41:44,124
I think one of your hairpins

795
00:41:44,124 --> 00:41:45,365
had fallen off.

796
00:41:46,204 --> 00:41:47,805
It should be around the pavilion.

797
00:41:47,805 --> 00:41:49,965
I'll look for it. You can go ahead.
Let's go.

798
00:41:56,445 --> 00:41:57,244
Young Lady Sun.

799
00:41:58,604 --> 00:41:59,644
Greetings, Yining.

800
00:42:01,365 --> 00:42:02,644
I saw you

801
00:42:02,644 --> 00:42:03,959
arriving together

802
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,360
with Third Young Master Luo today.

803
00:42:05,405 --> 00:42:06,204
That's right.

804
00:42:07,845 --> 00:42:09,365
I'm the sole child of the family.

805
00:42:09,564 --> 00:42:11,084
I was envious when I witnessed how close

806
00:42:11,084 --> 00:42:12,119
you two were as siblings.

807
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,600
Young Lady Sun, you must be joking.

808
00:42:13,664 --> 00:42:16,080
You're wise, gracious, and dignified.

809
00:42:16,284 --> 00:42:17,724
I'm envious of you instead.

810
00:42:20,644 --> 00:42:22,204
Yining, actually,

811
00:42:22,564 --> 00:42:24,124
I came here to ask you for a favor.

812
00:42:24,544 --> 00:42:25,968
Young Lady Sun, please go ahead.

813
00:42:26,405 --> 00:42:27,204
My father

814
00:42:27,965 --> 00:42:30,204
intends to betroth me
to Third Young Master Luo.

815
00:42:37,764 --> 00:42:39,885
Young Lady Sun, why are you

816
00:42:39,885 --> 00:42:40,965
telling me about this?

817
00:42:41,405 --> 00:42:43,485
Yining, you're always close

818
00:42:43,485 --> 00:42:44,965
to your third brother.

819
00:42:44,965 --> 00:42:46,325
You know him very well.

820
00:42:46,684 --> 00:42:49,204
I wish to know him better.

821
00:42:50,644 --> 00:42:51,965
Young Lady Sun, I'm afraid it's

822
00:42:51,968 --> 00:42:53,160
inappropriate to ask me this.

823
00:42:53,764 --> 00:42:56,204
Firstly, I'm no longer
a member of the Luo Family.

824
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:57,919
It's inappropriate for me

825
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,392
to talk about Third Young Master Luo.

826
00:42:59,424 --> 00:43:01,440
Secondly,
since this concerns your marriage,

827
00:43:01,764 --> 00:43:02,925
that makes me a stranger.

828
00:43:03,204 --> 00:43:04,845
I shouldn't meddle with your affairs.

829
00:43:04,845 --> 00:43:06,084
