(Adapted from Wen Tan's novel "Chancellor
Training Handbook" from Jinjiang Literature)

00:01:36,533 --> 00:01:39,173
=Episode 36=

4
00:01:41,478 --> 00:01:43,478
Burn this Golden-armored General

5
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:46,638
and the profit-sharing agreement

6
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:48,118
outside.

7
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Burn them right here.

8
00:01:57,118 --> 00:01:59,439
Marquis Lu, you seem distrustful of me.

9
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:02,799
Chancellor Wang, what are you saying?

10
00:02:03,398 --> 00:02:06,118
It's just that we always burn them
in front of each other.

11
00:02:06,368 --> 00:02:08,224
There's no need to go through
all this trouble.

12
00:02:10,638 --> 00:02:13,638
Marquis Lu, you're wary indeed.

13
00:02:13,958 --> 00:02:14,758
All right, then.

14
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,918
We can burn them here.

15
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:45,638
However,

16
00:02:45,918 --> 00:02:48,078
I didn't expect our framing

17
00:02:48,119 --> 00:02:49,238
of Yang Ling and Sun Jie

18
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,039
to ruin the entire trade route.

19
00:02:52,918 --> 00:02:55,478
Luckily, Chen Long and Chen Yang,
who managed the trade route

20
00:02:55,478 --> 00:02:57,039
for many years, are already dead.

21
00:02:57,119 --> 00:02:58,439
They cannot find anything out now.

22
00:02:58,638 --> 00:02:59,839
But we've already signed

23
00:03:00,064 --> 00:03:01,910
the contract for the next batch
of tea delivery

24
00:03:01,918 --> 00:03:03,039
by the coast long ago.

25
00:03:03,078 --> 00:03:04,839
Our deadline is nearing,

26
00:03:05,478 --> 00:03:07,719
and I never expected
our fleet to be destroyed.

27
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:10,678
Marquis Lu,

28
00:03:11,511 --> 00:03:13,391
do you have any solutions to this?

29
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,719
Yang Ling's case

30
00:03:17,279 --> 00:03:18,918
has already made His Majesty

31
00:03:18,944 --> 00:03:20,710
pay attention
to the inspection of the coast.

32
00:03:20,798 --> 00:03:21,879
Even if we do have a fleet,

33
00:03:21,904 --> 00:03:24,064
it'll still be inconvenient
for us to transport the goods.

34
00:03:24,128 --> 00:03:25,392
Why don't we discuss this

35
00:03:25,719 --> 00:03:27,238
with our clients?

36
00:03:27,279 --> 00:03:28,840
We can wait until
everything settles down

37
00:03:28,848 --> 00:03:29,910
before resuming the trade.

38
00:03:32,719 --> 00:03:34,279
Sun Jie was targeting you

39
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:37,719
with his words on the court
right before he

40
00:03:37,758 --> 00:03:39,039
was removed
from his position.

41
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,030
Although His Majesty
hasn't believed him,

42
00:03:41,119 --> 00:03:43,039
he'll still be suspicious of you.

43
00:03:43,918 --> 00:03:45,839
If anything happens by the coast again,

44
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:49,358
I'm afraid

45
00:03:50,119 --> 00:03:51,839
His Majesty will lose his trust in you.

46
00:03:57,958 --> 00:03:59,279
You do have a point.

47
00:04:00,279 --> 00:04:01,238
If that's the case,

48
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:04,478
we should put it aside for now.

49
00:04:04,528 --> 00:04:05,824
Chancellor Wang, you're wise indeed.

50
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:07,758
By the way,

51
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:10,279
Luo Shenyuan

52
00:04:10,279 --> 00:04:11,839
fell out with Sun Jie

53
00:04:11,999 --> 00:04:13,399
because of Yang Ling's case.

54
00:04:13,758 --> 00:04:15,638
He does know his circumstances well.

55
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:18,478
When we were trying
to arrest Chen Daoyan,

56
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,270
someone sabotaged
our operations repeatedly.

57
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,839
It was actually Luo Shenyuan.

58
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,080
If so,

59
00:04:24,159 --> 00:04:25,798
why didn't you arrest him?

60
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,879
He handles his matters flawlessly.

61
00:04:28,071 --> 00:04:29,672
He never leaves any evidence behind.

62
00:04:29,697 --> 00:04:30,336
However,

63
00:04:30,798 --> 00:04:32,959
from that, we can tell
that he's a devious person.

64
00:04:33,878 --> 00:04:35,639
It's good to be devious.

65
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,000
Do you think
you're able to become Marquis Anbei

66
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:41,439
without any deviousness?

67
00:04:42,358 --> 00:04:43,159
This person

68
00:04:43,438 --> 00:04:45,279
is Chen Jiuheng's disciple.

69
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:46,719
He's also Sun Jie's student.

70
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,918
We're not like-minded individuals.

71
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,361
People change eventually.

72
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:11,670
Chancellor Wang, I'm sure
he's approaching you

73
00:05:12,678 --> 00:05:13,878
with an ulterior motive.

74
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:21,039
Every official

75
00:05:23,719 --> 00:05:25,199
in the court

76
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:28,199
has an ulterior motive.

77
00:05:29,118 --> 00:05:30,798
Chancellor Wang, please think twice.

78
00:05:32,118 --> 00:05:33,118
Enough already.

79
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:34,639
Don't worry.

80
00:05:34,998 --> 00:05:37,719
I will think this through.

81
00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:44,039
Times have changed indeed.

82
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:48,118
You think Chen Jiuheng

83
00:05:49,118 --> 00:05:52,798
can compare to a grand minister?

84
00:05:58,016 --> 00:05:59,984
Chancellor Wang,
are you going to promote him

85
00:05:59,998 --> 00:06:02,279
to the rank of Vice Minister?

86
00:06:02,478 --> 00:06:03,798
It'll depend on

87
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:08,039
whether or not
he can adapt to the times.

88
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,120
(Marquis Anbei's Residence)

89
00:06:20,918 --> 00:06:21,918
Has Wang Yuan sent his men

90
00:06:21,998 --> 00:06:23,639
to track down Cheng Lang?

91
00:06:23,878 --> 00:06:24,678
Indeed.

92
00:06:28,535 --> 00:06:29,616
I'm afraid Wang Yuan

93
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,558
is starting to get suspicious of us.

94
00:06:32,118 --> 00:06:33,238
Even so,

95
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:34,478
it shouldn't even matter.

96
00:06:34,608 --> 00:06:35,730
All the people who knew about

97
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,440
our involvement with
the tea-smuggling deals

98
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,390
are all dead.

99
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:40,318
And, the contracts

100
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:41,719
were all burned down by Wang Yuan

101
00:06:41,719 --> 00:06:43,478
in front of us
after the deals were done.

102
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:45,639
He no longer has any leverage over us.

103
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:46,798
Speaking of that,

104
00:06:48,719 --> 00:06:50,079
we have the goods on him.

105
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:51,318
He thought

106
00:06:51,472 --> 00:06:53,499
he did a perfect job
when he exchanged tea leaves

107
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:54,590
for subpar horses and smuggled

108
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:56,399
the tea leaves along the coast

109
00:06:56,878 --> 00:06:58,318
without our knowledge.

110
00:06:59,438 --> 00:07:00,639
If he dares to turn on us,

111
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,990
he shouldn't blame me
for showing him no mercy.

112
00:07:04,878 --> 00:07:05,438
My Lord...

113
00:07:07,118 --> 00:07:08,719
You can tell me what's on your mind.

114
00:07:10,432 --> 00:07:12,030
Initially, you said you wanted to use

115
00:07:12,118 --> 00:07:13,719
Luo Shenyuan to deal with Wang Yuan.

116
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:16,111
But why did you tell Wang Yuan

117
00:07:16,112 --> 00:07:18,512
about the relationship
between Luo Shenyuan and Chen Jiuheng?

118
00:07:19,358 --> 00:07:20,438
I'll say the same thing.

119
00:07:22,118 --> 00:07:23,839
Between Luo Shenyuan and Wang Yuan,

120
00:07:24,224 --> 00:07:25,870
who do you think is harder to deal with?

121
00:07:26,318 --> 00:07:27,558
Do you mean...

122
00:07:28,159 --> 00:07:29,438
This Luo Shenyuan

123
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:34,798
might be harder to deal with

124
00:07:34,798 --> 00:07:35,878
than we imagine.

125
00:07:37,191 --> 00:07:39,137
(Wang Yuan)

126
00:07:39,409 --> 00:07:42,088
(Huanjing Pavilion)

127
00:07:43,998 --> 00:07:45,199
I got it wrong again?

128
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,839
Where did you get wrong?

129
00:07:49,438 --> 00:07:50,238
Father.

130
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:52,118
Hurry, please have a seat.

131
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:55,478
I heard

132
00:07:55,536 --> 00:07:57,430
that it's been some days
since you left the room.

133
00:07:57,438 --> 00:07:59,438
You didn't even visit
Yanrong Pavilion lately.

134
00:07:59,998 --> 00:08:01,719
Were you sick?

135
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:06,238
Someone else
is managing Yanrong Pavilion.

136
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:08,918
I only need to do the accounts at home.

137
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:10,399
Moreover,

138
00:08:10,438 --> 00:08:12,478
if I frequent Yanrong Pavilion,

139
00:08:12,678 --> 00:08:14,118
people might gossip about me

140
00:08:14,279 --> 00:08:15,959
if they see me often.

141
00:08:17,438 --> 00:08:18,678
I can rest at ease, then.

142
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,279
I was worried

143
00:08:20,678 --> 00:08:22,478
that you were still upset with

144
00:08:22,558 --> 00:08:24,238
what Luo Shenyuan had done.

145
00:08:26,358 --> 00:08:28,438
Father, what do you mean by that?

146
00:08:29,118 --> 00:08:29,998
I know

147
00:08:30,279 --> 00:08:32,718
that you have a deep sibling bond
with Luo Shenyuan.

148
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:36,918
But during Yang Ling's case,

149
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:38,399
I didn't expect him

150
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,999
to be such a flatterer.

151
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,360
There's no need to attend classes
taught by someone like him.

152
00:08:44,119 --> 00:08:45,999
In the future, you shouldn't have

153
00:08:45,999 --> 00:08:47,119
any dealings with him.

154
00:08:47,119 --> 00:08:48,198
You should stay away from him.

155
00:08:48,558 --> 00:08:49,318
Father,

156
00:08:50,119 --> 00:08:50,999
maybe

157
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:52,798
he has bitter reasons for doing so.

158
00:08:53,718 --> 00:08:55,958
I don't care what kind
of bitter reason he has.

159
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:57,168
As a man,

160
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,270
there are certain things
that he should and shouldn't do.

161
00:08:59,318 --> 00:09:01,239
Yang Ling will be executed
after the fall.

162
00:09:01,598 --> 00:09:04,078
Mr. Sun was removed from his post
and sent back to his hometown.

163
00:09:04,119 --> 00:09:06,318
He was related to both of these cases.

164
00:09:06,558 --> 00:09:08,159
A betrayer like him

165
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:09,678
is looked down upon by everyone.

166
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:12,958
All right now.

167
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:14,639
Let's not talk about him.

168
00:09:14,798 --> 00:09:15,639
What about this?

169
00:09:15,952 --> 00:09:16,880
The day after tomorrow,

170
00:09:16,999 --> 00:09:18,789
you should follow me
to the temple on Mount Nan.

171
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,656
We'll offer our prayers
and take a walk outside.

172
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:22,558
You can also take
a breather there, okay?

173
00:09:49,632 --> 00:09:51,710
My Lord, I didn't know
that you were visiting us.

174
00:09:51,718 --> 00:09:53,119
Sorry for the rudeness.

175
00:09:54,119 --> 00:09:55,279
Someone reported to us

176
00:09:55,558 --> 00:09:57,279
that the fleet of Longquan Trading House

177
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,598
was smuggling goods.

178
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,918
My Lord, where did you hear that from?

179
00:10:01,078 --> 00:10:02,399
That's a baseless accusation.

180
00:10:02,438 --> 00:10:03,438
Indeed.

181
00:10:03,558 --> 00:10:04,639
But you see,

182
00:10:04,678 --> 00:10:06,239
I have to act impartially.

183
00:10:06,999 --> 00:10:09,039
Buddies, search the fleet.

184
00:10:09,039 --> 00:10:09,759
Yes, sir.

185
00:10:10,479 --> 00:10:11,639
What is this?

186
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,479
These are silk fabrics.

187
00:10:15,359 --> 00:10:17,479
These silk fabrics look exquisite.

188
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,279
What is that?

189
00:10:24,879 --> 00:10:25,999
My Lord, it's nothing.

190
00:10:26,678 --> 00:10:28,639
Show it to me.

191
00:10:29,798 --> 00:10:30,639
This...

192
00:10:42,119 --> 00:10:44,239
My Lord, I don't think
there's a need for that.

193
00:10:44,438 --> 00:10:45,838
Get out of my way.

194
00:10:49,927 --> 00:10:52,214
(Ivory, Rhinoceros Horn,
Golden Fragrant Wood, The Fragrance)

195
00:10:52,479 --> 00:10:53,438
You're something else.

196
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,719
Ivory, rhinoceros horns, and rare herbs?

197
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:01,424
Seize all of them!

198
00:11:01,456 --> 00:11:02,320
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

199
00:11:02,352 --> 00:11:03,150
- Go!
- Go!

200
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:07,451
(Liuhe Tavern)

201
00:11:08,176 --> 00:11:09,390
It's rare for us to gather.

202
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:11,798
Please guide me in the future.

203
00:11:14,558 --> 00:11:15,438
Search the area!

204
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:15,936
Yes, sir!

205
00:11:16,598 --> 00:11:18,239
Search the area thoroughly!

206
00:11:18,239 --> 00:11:18,798
Leave!

207
00:11:18,798 --> 00:11:20,718
Leave no stone unturned!

208
00:11:20,718 --> 00:11:21,798
Hurry up!

209
00:11:21,798 --> 00:11:23,239
Search the area thoroughly!

210
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:25,078
Leave no stone unturned!

211
00:11:25,078 --> 00:11:25,759
Hurry and leave!

212
00:11:28,119 --> 00:11:28,958
Vice Minister Li.

213
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,200
Minister Luo, I didn't expect

214
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,039
to see you having tea here today.

215
00:11:35,318 --> 00:11:36,718
What happened?

216
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:39,678
Shopkeeper Zheng of Liuhe Tavern
was suspected of smuggling goods.

217
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:41,639
Minister Luo, if there's nothing else,

218
00:11:41,798 --> 00:11:43,279
you should leave the place.

219
00:11:43,488 --> 00:11:44,016
All right.

220
00:11:44,032 --> 00:11:45,710
Let's go. Search upstairs.

221
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,304
Yes, sir.

222
00:11:46,918 --> 00:11:49,279
Let us gather again next time.

223
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:50,798
Farewell.

224
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:52,119
Farewell.

225
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:59,005
(Chancellor's Residence)

226
00:12:22,838 --> 00:12:25,039
Chancellor Wang,
Minister Luo has arrived.

227
00:12:31,119 --> 00:12:31,918
Chancellor Wang.

228
00:12:35,678 --> 00:12:36,558
Minister Luo.

229
00:12:37,678 --> 00:12:39,438
You came here in a hurry.

230
00:12:39,838 --> 00:12:41,159
Is there something urgent?

231
00:12:41,783 --> 00:12:43,064
Chancellor Wang, please save me.

232
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:44,399
What happened?

233
00:12:44,718 --> 00:12:46,838
Calm down. Take your time
and explain yourself.

234
00:12:48,198 --> 00:12:49,279
Today, Vice Minister Li

235
00:12:49,664 --> 00:12:50,950
inspected Longquan Trading House's

236
00:12:50,999 --> 00:12:52,438
fleet with his men.

237
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:53,999
They found

238
00:12:55,798 --> 00:12:56,718
certain items.

239
00:12:59,999 --> 00:13:01,359
What kind of items?

240
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:02,159
They found

241
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:04,759
rhinoceros horns, ivory,

242
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:05,958
and

243
00:13:07,999 --> 00:13:08,838
some rare herbs.

244
00:13:10,198 --> 00:13:12,999
Were they all imported
using the sea route?

245
00:13:13,838 --> 00:13:14,678
Indeed.

246
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:18,479
That means they're smuggling goods.

247
00:13:20,119 --> 00:13:23,519
But what has their smuggling

248
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:26,279
got to do with you?

249
00:13:26,798 --> 00:13:27,718
To be honest,

250
00:13:28,119 --> 00:13:29,838
I was the one who founded

251
00:13:31,335 --> 00:13:32,574
Longquan Trading House.

252
00:13:34,119 --> 00:13:36,958
Minister Luo, according
to the state law,

253
00:13:37,598 --> 00:13:40,359
officials must not compete
with the people for profit.

254
00:13:40,598 --> 00:13:42,359
Not only have you done so,

255
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:43,718
but you're also smuggling goods.

256
00:13:45,968 --> 00:13:47,968
Chancellor Wang,
please practice wise judgment.

257
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,840
I founded Longquan Trading House

258
00:13:49,879 --> 00:13:51,119
before joining the officialdom.

259
00:13:51,119 --> 00:13:52,119
I only imported those goods

260
00:13:52,119 --> 00:13:53,509
under someone else's request.

261
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:54,832
I didn't import a huge amount.

262
00:13:54,896 --> 00:13:55,888
There was only one chest.

263
00:13:56,678 --> 00:13:58,438
Even so, it's considered smuggling.

264
00:14:08,999 --> 00:14:10,159
This concerns my life.

265
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:12,759
Chancellor Wang, I only dare
to tell you about you.

266
00:14:12,816 --> 00:14:14,750
Chancellor Wang,
if you're willing to save me,

267
00:14:14,879 --> 00:14:15,838
from now on,

268
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:18,479
I'm willing to dedicate myself

269
00:14:18,718 --> 00:14:19,838
to your cause.

270
00:14:22,039 --> 00:14:23,438
Enough already.

271
00:14:24,438 --> 00:14:26,279
It's not a major deal anyway.

272
00:14:26,718 --> 00:14:27,558
You should get up.

273
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:31,879
Chancellor Wang,

274
00:14:33,598 --> 00:14:35,678
are you willing to help me out?

275
00:14:39,798 --> 00:14:40,598
I heard

276
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,879
that you were Chen Jiuheng's disciple.

277
00:15:05,184 --> 00:15:07,630
Minister Luo, is it inconvenient
for you to talk about that?

278
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,718
Chancellor Wang,
I'll tell you everything.

279
00:15:16,438 --> 00:15:17,198
You're right.

280
00:15:20,479 --> 00:15:21,639
You may rise.

281
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:22,838
Come here.

282
00:15:22,912 --> 00:15:24,048
Thank you, Chancellor Wang.

283
00:15:25,479 --> 00:15:28,718
Back then, Chen Jiuheng took his
own life to escape punishment.

284
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:32,039
All of his students
were implicated because of him.

285
00:15:32,479 --> 00:15:34,999
But you were the only disciple

286
00:15:35,678 --> 00:15:37,159
that nobody knew.

287
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,399
Back then, I had an embarrassing status.

288
00:15:44,528 --> 00:15:47,280
It was inconvenient for him
to include my name in his student list.

289
00:15:48,798 --> 00:15:50,159
Why is that the case?

290
00:15:50,838 --> 00:15:52,438
Back then, Old Master Luo

291
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,759
was valued by His Majesty as well.

292
00:15:55,918 --> 00:15:57,399
Back then, I endured all kinds

293
00:15:58,112 --> 00:15:59,920
of humiliation in the Luo's Residence.

294
00:16:00,736 --> 00:16:03,150
I was a commoner's son
who was unacknowledged by the family.

295
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:04,800
My mother passed away
when I was very young.

296
00:16:05,318 --> 00:16:08,159
My father saw me
as nothing more than a weed.

297
00:16:08,838 --> 00:16:10,039
No one respected me.

298
00:16:10,798 --> 00:16:11,958
If that's the case,

299
00:16:13,438 --> 00:16:15,838
how did you get
to know Chen Jiuheng, then?

300
00:16:16,119 --> 00:16:17,279
I love to study.

301
00:16:17,408 --> 00:16:19,232
But my father didn't allow me to study.

302
00:16:19,248 --> 00:16:19,990
I hated him for it.

303
00:16:20,359 --> 00:16:22,438
Therefore, I snuck out of the residence.

304
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:23,558
By a stroke of luck,

305
00:16:23,838 --> 00:16:25,198
I ended up at Official Chen's academy.

306
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:27,958
Back then, he was still a teacher.

307
00:16:31,359 --> 00:16:32,918
You do resemble me

308
00:16:35,039 --> 00:16:36,958
when I was young.

309
00:16:37,838 --> 00:16:40,359
Chancellor Wang, why do you say so?

310
00:16:41,696 --> 00:16:43,360
My parents died when I was very young.

311
00:16:44,119 --> 00:16:45,438
I was abandoned by my kin.

312
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,359
I had to compete with dogs for food.

313
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:49,198
The only thing I didn't forget

314
00:16:50,078 --> 00:16:51,718
was studying.

315
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:54,119
It's because that was my only chance

316
00:16:54,678 --> 00:16:56,999
at making a name for myself.

317
00:16:58,798 --> 00:17:00,119
Chancellor Wang,

318
00:17:00,544 --> 00:17:02,928
I didn't expect you
to have such a rough past as well.

319
00:17:05,318 --> 00:17:06,638
It's all in the past now.

320
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,959
Where were you
when Chen Jiuheng passed away?

321
00:17:10,992 --> 00:17:11,984
At the Luo's Residence.

322
00:17:20,318 --> 00:17:21,999
If so, why did you help

323
00:17:22,118 --> 00:17:23,999
Chen Daoyan

324
00:17:24,838 --> 00:17:26,519
when he fled from pursuit?

325
00:17:26,798 --> 00:17:28,039
He escaped to the Luo's Residence.

326
00:17:28,638 --> 00:17:30,158
If I didn't help him to hide,

327
00:17:30,158 --> 00:17:32,398
the entire Luo's Residence
would be implicated.

328
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:33,838
I would be implicated as well.

329
00:17:36,439 --> 00:17:37,838
What about the prison break, then?

330
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,688
I was just repaying his kindness.

331
00:17:43,719 --> 00:17:45,519
Repaying his kindness?

332
00:17:45,999 --> 00:17:47,959
Although Chen Jiuheng
didn't know who I was,

333
00:17:48,479 --> 00:17:49,719
he taught me how to study.

334
00:17:50,358 --> 00:17:51,679
Since I couldn't save him,

335
00:17:51,719 --> 00:17:52,838
I should at least

336
00:17:53,398 --> 00:17:54,558
save his disciple.

337
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:56,558
Excellent.

338
00:17:57,392 --> 00:17:58,670
This is interesting indeed.

339
00:18:00,398 --> 00:18:02,039
I can see why you're a businessperson.

340
00:18:04,358 --> 00:18:05,838
But Chen Daoyan

341
00:18:05,999 --> 00:18:07,759
still died in the end.

342
00:18:08,598 --> 00:18:09,439
How do you intend

343
00:18:10,439 --> 00:18:12,398
to repay his kindness now?

344
00:18:14,519 --> 00:18:15,479
I've already done my best.

345
00:18:15,999 --> 00:18:17,158
The past is in the past.

346
00:18:17,999 --> 00:18:18,798
As humans,

347
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:20,838
we should always look forward.

348
00:18:21,598 --> 00:18:23,759
Excellent.

349
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,558
I'm sure you can do great things.

350
00:18:30,838 --> 00:18:33,798
Coincidentally,
I have a business deal right now.

351
00:18:34,118 --> 00:18:35,919
I need a trading fleet
to transport my goods.

352
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,519
Chancellor Wang, as long as

353
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:41,358
you help me to resolve this emergency,

354
00:18:42,118 --> 00:18:44,999
the entire Longquan Trading Company
will be at your disposal.

355
00:18:47,638 --> 00:18:50,759
However, before that,

356
00:18:51,838 --> 00:18:54,959
I need you to do something for me.

357
00:18:55,358 --> 00:18:57,158
Chancellor Wang, please tell me.

358
00:18:57,878 --> 00:18:59,999
Duke Ying, that coward,

359
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:02,118
he always went against me.

360
00:19:02,598 --> 00:19:05,439
He has sabotaged my operations
time and time again.

361
00:19:05,838 --> 00:19:08,199
I wanted to get rid of him long ago.

362
00:19:08,999 --> 00:19:12,479
What if I want him dead?

363
00:19:12,999 --> 00:19:15,039
Are you able to accomplish the task?

364
00:19:20,358 --> 00:19:21,199
Of course,

365
00:19:21,838 --> 00:19:22,838
I know

366
00:19:23,999 --> 00:19:26,999
that you have a strong sibling bond
with Young Lady Wei.

367
00:19:27,598 --> 00:19:29,118
However, her father

368
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:31,558
isn't on my side.

369
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:32,479
Therefore,

370
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,838
if you wish to seek my help,

371
00:19:36,999 --> 00:19:39,158
you have to sever your ties
with the Wei Family.

372
00:19:39,878 --> 00:19:41,838
It won't end well

373
00:19:42,878 --> 00:19:44,358
if you try to be a two-timer.

374
00:19:47,999 --> 00:19:50,199
Chancellor Wang, my loyalty to you

375
00:19:50,398 --> 00:19:51,439
knows no bounds.

376
00:19:51,719 --> 00:19:53,358
Do it yourself.

377
00:19:54,279 --> 00:19:55,638
Kill Duke Ying,

378
00:19:56,679 --> 00:19:58,358
and I shall place my trust in you.

379
00:20:00,838 --> 00:20:02,398
Those who intend to achieve great feats

380
00:20:03,158 --> 00:20:04,959
cannot afford to be compassionate.

381
00:20:06,118 --> 00:20:07,679
Since you want to survive

382
00:20:07,798 --> 00:20:09,279
and make a profit,

383
00:20:10,358 --> 00:20:12,279
you have to give up
on something in exchange.

384
00:20:14,118 --> 00:20:14,999
Yes, Chancellor Wang.

385
00:20:15,638 --> 00:20:18,199
But Duke Ying

386
00:20:18,999 --> 00:20:20,558
is an important official.

387
00:20:21,078 --> 00:20:22,519
Murdering a court official

388
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:24,519
is a heinous crime.

389
00:20:26,199 --> 00:20:27,358
In three days,

390
00:20:28,439 --> 00:20:30,199
he and his daughter will be

391
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:32,576
offering their prayers
at a temple in the mountains.

392
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:35,158
If you complete this mission,

393
00:20:35,598 --> 00:20:37,439
you shall be the Vice Minister

394
00:20:38,158 --> 00:20:39,398
of Court of Judicial Review.

395
00:20:39,616 --> 00:20:42,030
You might also be promoted
to one of the Nine Grand Ministers

396
00:20:43,398 --> 00:20:45,039
in the future.

397
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:51,504
(Chancellor's Residence)

398
00:20:53,558 --> 00:20:54,358
Young Master.

399
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:07,700
Chancellor Wang,

400
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:11,439
do you think Luo Shenyuan
will kill Duke Ying?

401
00:21:11,878 --> 00:21:13,919
That'll depend on his determination.

402
00:21:14,878 --> 00:21:15,959
I cannot tolerate my men

403
00:21:15,999 --> 00:21:17,558
being indecisive and half-hearted.

404
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:19,838
But what if he tries to kill him

405
00:21:20,158 --> 00:21:21,398
and fails to do so?

406
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:23,279
That's why you exist.

407
00:21:24,679 --> 00:21:26,279
Since he has already acted,

408
00:21:27,318 --> 00:21:29,999
you just need to give him
another push in secret.

409
00:21:30,999 --> 00:21:31,999
Understood.

410
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:33,349
Young Master,

411
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:35,392
it was obvious that the crook
was trying to test you.

412
00:21:35,424 --> 00:21:36,470
You think I had no idea?

413
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:38,118
He benefits from it if I succeed.

414
00:21:38,118 --> 00:21:39,039
Even if I fail,

415
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:40,558
he won't be implicated.

416
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,838
That old crook is devious indeed.

417
00:21:43,358 --> 00:21:44,039
He even told me

418
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:45,679
to get rid of them

419
00:21:45,838 --> 00:21:46,959
while Yining was around.

420
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:48,510
Is he telling you to do this

421
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:49,936
so that you have to sever your ties

422
00:21:49,968 --> 00:21:51,150
with the Wei Family?

423
00:21:51,168 --> 00:21:52,736
No matter if it's a success or not,

424
00:21:52,838 --> 00:21:54,719
I have to sever my ties
with the Wei Family.

425
00:21:54,999 --> 00:21:56,638
Only then will he place his trust in me.

426
00:21:57,529 --> 00:21:59,689
What should we do, then?

427
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,613
(Duke Ying's Residence)

428
00:22:10,318 --> 00:22:11,078
Young Lady.

429
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:12,838
Where's Father?

430
00:22:12,999 --> 00:22:14,509
Duke Ying was supposed to come out.

431
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,920
But urgent military affairs appeared.

432
00:22:15,936 --> 00:22:17,020
He won't be able to join you.

433
00:22:17,358 --> 00:22:18,598
If so, I won't go as well.

434
00:22:18,638 --> 00:22:19,759
Duke Ying said

435
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:20,838
you should offer your prayers

436
00:22:20,838 --> 00:22:22,118
to the temple on his behalf.

437
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,001
Seems like Father is bent on making me

438
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:26,999
leave the residence.

439
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,358
I could tell as well.

440
00:22:28,479 --> 00:22:30,358
Young Lady, you've been
quite upset lately.

441
00:22:30,398 --> 00:22:32,118
It's good for you
to take a walk outside.

442
00:22:32,719 --> 00:22:35,039
If so, I'll head there myself, then.

443
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,488
(Changhe Gate)

444
00:22:42,719 --> 00:22:43,519
Marquis Lu,

445
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,300
there was an urgent report
from the palace.

446
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:47,040
The newly appointed leader
in the North suddenly

447
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,904
caused a commotion.

448
00:22:48,448 --> 00:22:49,710
Who will His Majesty send there

449
00:22:49,838 --> 00:22:50,999
to quell the unrest?

450
00:22:51,279 --> 00:22:52,999
He sent Duke Ying there before this.

451
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:56,358
I suppose he'll send him there again.

452
00:22:58,959 --> 00:22:59,631
My Lord!

453
00:22:59,632 --> 00:23:00,630
Spare us some coins.

454
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:01,440
- My Lord!
- Go away.

455
00:23:01,456 --> 00:23:02,070
Ye Yan.

456
00:23:02,368 --> 00:23:04,000
- Spare us some coins!
- Spare us some coins!

457
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:04,790
I remember now.

458
00:23:05,118 --> 00:23:05,999
That carriage

459
00:23:06,158 --> 00:23:07,798
belongs to Duke Ying.

460
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,681
How did you know?

461
00:23:09,959 --> 00:23:10,759
I saw it before

462
00:23:10,759 --> 00:23:12,039
when I entered the city.

463
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:13,280
I thought it was pretty grand.

464
00:23:13,312 --> 00:23:14,959
I even asked someone about it.
I'm certain.

465
00:23:14,959 --> 00:23:16,189
But why did that horse rush out

466
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:17,472
of the city as if it went berserk?

467
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,150
That was strange.

468
00:23:18,199 --> 00:23:19,199
I wonder who's on

469
00:23:19,199 --> 00:23:20,279
the carriage.

470
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:21,110
You're right.

471
00:23:24,158 --> 00:23:24,959
Guys.

472
00:23:28,472 --> 00:23:29,433
Mister, what do you need?

473
00:23:29,613 --> 00:23:30,373
Guys,

474
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,576
were you guys talking about
Duke Ying's carriage just now?

475
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,830
We saw Duke Ying's carriage

476
00:23:33,838 --> 00:23:35,476
charging ahead

477
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,720
when we were on the mountain path.

478
00:23:36,736 --> 00:23:38,990
It was as if the horse had gone berserk.

479
00:23:39,184 --> 00:23:40,610
Where did you guys see the carriage?

480
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,921
In the forest to the west.

481
00:23:44,078 --> 00:23:44,878
My Lord,

482
00:23:44,937 --> 00:23:45,897
are you worried

483
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,690
that Young Lady Yining
might be on the carriage?

484
00:23:47,696 --> 00:23:49,015
I heard that Duke Ying

485
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:50,919
was taking Yining to a temple

486
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,561
on the mountains today.

487
00:24:17,959 --> 00:24:18,558
What's wrong?

488
00:24:29,118 --> 00:24:29,759
You!

489
00:25:22,759 --> 00:25:23,398
My Lord,

490
00:25:23,584 --> 00:25:25,328
it seems like Duke Ying
isn't in the carriage.

491
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,456
Let's wait and observe.

492
00:25:55,078 --> 00:25:55,558
Young Lady!

493
00:25:57,199 --> 00:25:57,878
Young Lady!

494
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:09,279
You!

495
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:18,608
Luo Shenyuan,

496
00:26:18,848 --> 00:26:19,856
you dared to hurt her!

497
00:26:20,959 --> 00:26:22,358
I shall send you to your grave!

498
00:26:42,919 --> 00:26:43,679
Yining.

499
00:26:44,798 --> 00:26:45,598
Are you okay?

500
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:47,952
Come. Let me send you back.

501
00:27:00,304 --> 00:27:01,430
Investigate the situation.

502
00:27:01,479 --> 00:27:01,959
Yes, sir.

503
00:27:02,598 --> 00:27:03,078
Let's go.

504
00:27:23,586 --> 00:27:29,687
(Western Forest, Temple, City Gate)

505
00:27:39,248 --> 00:27:40,768
Duke Ying will take Yining to the temple

506
00:27:40,838 --> 00:27:42,239
a quarter past the Hour of Shen.

507
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:45,118
They'll definitely take this path.

508
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:47,039
By then,

509
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:48,608
try and stop the carriage in its track.

510
00:27:49,239 --> 00:27:51,439
They can only head
to the mountains by using

511
00:27:51,439 --> 00:27:52,558
the western forest trail.

512
00:27:52,816 --> 00:27:55,184
They should be arriving at
a quarter past the Hour of You.

513
00:27:55,536 --> 00:27:57,680
Lu Jiaxue will return at the same time
after his training.

514
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:58,990
He'll surely pass by the city gate.

515
00:27:58,992 --> 00:28:01,073
The city gate is near
to the western forest trail.

516
00:28:01,327 --> 00:28:03,047
By then, try to lure him there.

517
00:28:03,072 --> 00:28:04,750
Young Master,
do you intend to lure him here

518
00:28:04,838 --> 00:28:06,279
from the city gate?

519
00:28:06,558 --> 00:28:07,959
The timing is very tight.

520
00:28:08,319 --> 00:28:09,880
But what if he doesn't fall for it?

521
00:28:10,199 --> 00:28:11,358
Concern leads to chaos.

522
00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:12,999
He will be here.

523
00:28:13,759 --> 00:28:15,039
Not only will he be here,

524
00:28:15,248 --> 00:28:16,910
but Wang Yuan will also
send his men here

525
00:28:16,959 --> 00:28:18,439
to put me under surveillance.

526
00:28:19,078 --> 00:28:20,318
Young Master,

527
00:28:20,558 --> 00:28:22,838
do you intend to make Lu Jiaxue

528
00:28:22,838 --> 00:28:24,959
and Wang Yuan turn against each other?

529
00:28:25,358 --> 00:28:25,959
That's right.

530
00:28:27,145 --> 00:28:28,585
That's the best solution.

531
00:28:32,448 --> 00:28:34,688
(Huanjing Pavilion)
Hurry. Get me some water and medicine.

532
00:28:37,398 --> 00:28:38,999
How is it? Come. Let me take a look.

533
00:28:40,439 --> 00:28:40,999
Marquis Lu!

534
00:28:41,798 --> 00:28:42,318
Marquis Lu,

535
00:28:42,938 --> 00:28:44,658
thank you for helping me out today.

536
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:46,343
You should head back first.

537
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,510
I'll go and kill him right now.

538
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:53,229
Lu Jiaxue,
this is none of your business!

539
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:53,840
Don't go!

540
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,520
It's my business
when he wants to kill you!

541
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,750
I'll investigate the case myself!

542
00:29:00,118 --> 00:29:00,759
Yining.

543
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,950
I told you already
he will resort to anything

544
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,960
to obtain the things he desires.

545
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,830
He's buttering Wang Yuan up
so that he'll be one

546
00:29:06,832 --> 00:29:08,350
of Nine Grand Ministers
in the future.

547
00:29:08,543 --> 00:29:09,343
Do you think

548
00:29:09,798 --> 00:29:11,719
he still cares about your bond with him?

549
00:29:12,199 --> 00:29:13,279
Stop that.

550
00:29:15,792 --> 00:29:16,870
Come, let me have a look.

551
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:20,719
Yining.

552
00:29:21,008 --> 00:29:22,470
I'm the only person in the world

553
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,360
who loves you wholeheartedly.

554
00:29:26,215 --> 00:29:26,598
Come.

555
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:27,318
Grandma.

556
00:29:27,479 --> 00:29:28,279
Yining.

557
00:29:28,798 --> 00:29:29,598
Grandma.

558
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:30,838
Yining.

559
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:33,679
What happened?

560
00:29:34,118 --> 00:29:35,598
Grandma, what are you doing here?

561
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:36,656
Look at the state you're in.

562
00:29:36,656 --> 00:29:37,680
How could I not be here?

563
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:39,040
Who's bold enough

564
00:29:39,088 --> 00:29:40,270
to assassinate my granddaughter?

565
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:41,439
- Yining!
- Father?

566
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,214
Lu Jiaxue!

567
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:46,160
- Stop it!
- Father!

568
00:29:46,439 --> 00:29:47,158
Stop it.

569
00:29:49,398 --> 00:29:50,199
Tell me.

570
00:29:50,959 --> 00:29:52,078
Who did it?

571
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:54,130
It was Luo Shenyuan.

572
00:29:57,318 --> 00:29:58,239
Is that true?

573
00:30:06,503 --> 00:30:07,224
Yining.

574
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:09,118
You don't need to cover up for him.

575
00:30:09,439 --> 00:30:11,109
I injured his left shoulder.

576
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,432
We'll find out if we examine it.

577
00:30:13,959 --> 00:30:14,759
Father!

578
00:30:15,118 --> 00:30:16,398
Just stay out of his way.

579
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:18,199
How dare he hurt
a member of the Wei Family?

580
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,721
We won't let him off.

581
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:30,558
Marquis Lu.

582
00:30:31,731 --> 00:30:33,210
Thank you for rescuing her today.

583
00:30:33,912 --> 00:30:35,952
My gratitude knows no bounds.

584
00:30:36,064 --> 00:30:37,670
I shall repay your kindness
in the future.

585
00:30:38,368 --> 00:30:40,007
I shall not keep you here
any longer today.

586
00:30:40,657 --> 00:30:41,256
Please.

587
00:30:56,016 --> 00:30:57,104
Hurry and notify them!

588
00:31:03,078 --> 00:31:04,078
Where's Luo Shenyuan?

589
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:06,598
Duke Ying, what do you mean by this?

590
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,560
What has Shenyuan done wrong?

591
00:31:08,585 --> 00:31:09,746
Has he offended you?

592
00:31:09,878 --> 00:31:11,039
He tried to assassinate Yining.

593
00:31:11,168 --> 00:31:12,430
Is that considered a wrong deed?

594
00:31:12,496 --> 00:31:14,160
Does that count as an offense toward me?

595
00:31:15,318 --> 00:31:16,429
How could that be?

596
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:17,856
I don't think that's possible either.

597
00:31:18,239 --> 00:31:20,798
That's why I came here
to confirm the truth.

598
00:31:20,990 --> 00:31:21,632
Hurry and go.

599
00:31:22,279 --> 00:31:24,039
Bring Luo Shenyuan here.

600
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:25,408
Yes, Mother.

601
00:31:38,071 --> 00:31:39,311
Young Master, this is bad.

602
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:40,398
Duke Ying is here.

603
00:32:05,999 --> 00:32:06,838
Duke Ying.

604
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:08,598
Grandma, Mother.

605
00:32:14,118 --> 00:32:15,719
Why are you guys doing this?

606
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:18,598
Duke Ying, what do you mean by this?

607
00:32:18,759 --> 00:32:20,878
Duke Ying,
I'm sure this is a misunderstanding.

608
00:32:20,944 --> 00:32:23,040
Yining and Shenyuan
had been close to each other.

609
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:24,544
He would never do something like that.

610
00:32:29,479 --> 00:32:30,999
If I'm not mistaken,

611
00:32:31,047 --> 00:32:32,327
I suppose you were

612
00:32:32,352 --> 00:32:33,513
trying to assassinate me.

613
00:32:36,598 --> 00:32:38,798
Duke Ying, I don't know
what you're talking about.

614
00:32:38,959 --> 00:32:39,838
You don't know, huh?

615
00:32:44,992 --> 00:32:47,110
Duke Ying, you hold
a high position and great power.

616
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:48,544
How could you hit him for no reason?

617
00:32:48,838 --> 00:32:49,878
Was that even a hit?

618
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:52,401
Are Young Master Luo

619
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:53,936
so weak
that he can't even stand that?

620
00:32:53,952 --> 00:32:54,710
I suppose Lu Jiaxue

621
00:32:54,783 --> 00:32:56,624
caused that injury, am I right?

622
00:32:57,118 --> 00:32:57,919
Shenyuan,

623
00:32:58,199 --> 00:32:59,398
what exactly is going on?

624
00:32:59,398 --> 00:33:01,279
Hurry and explain yourself.

625
00:33:01,598 --> 00:33:02,589
I have no idea

626
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:03,536
how Duke Ying found out

627
00:33:03,568 --> 00:33:04,830
that my left shoulder was injured.

628
00:33:04,838 --> 00:33:06,389
I got injured when I bumped into

629
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:08,224
the table accidentally
while moving my books.

630
00:33:08,544 --> 00:33:09,760
You bumped into your table, huh?

631
00:33:11,344 --> 00:33:12,400
If so, the injury must

632
00:33:12,439 --> 00:33:14,558
be different from a stab wound, right?

633
00:33:14,558 --> 00:33:15,279
Remove your shirt.

634
00:33:15,392 --> 00:33:16,624
Show me your injury.

635
00:33:20,224 --> 00:33:21,070
Remove your shirt!

636
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,519
Luo Shenyuan,

637
00:33:29,361 --> 00:33:30,720
how dare you?

638
00:33:31,224 --> 00:33:32,624
You tried to target me and Yining

639
00:33:32,999 --> 00:33:34,919
all because you wanted
to please Wang Yuan, huh?

640
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:38,078
Tie him up!

641
00:33:38,798 --> 00:33:39,598
Father!

642
00:33:40,838 --> 00:33:41,598
Yining?

643
00:33:43,408 --> 00:33:44,430
What are you doing here

644
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:45,712
instead of recuperating at home?

645
00:33:46,279 --> 00:33:47,479
Yining, are you injured?

646
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,279
Grandma, Mother.

647
00:33:50,719 --> 00:33:52,440
Don't worry. I'm fine.

648
00:33:56,047 --> 00:33:58,448
Father, I have some questions

649
00:33:58,473 --> 00:33:59,673
for Third Young Master Luo.

650
00:34:03,439 --> 00:34:04,279
Go ahead.

651
00:34:09,558 --> 00:34:11,278
Do you have to choose this path

652
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:12,961
and continue down it?

653
00:34:26,238 --> 00:34:27,238
I understand now.

654
00:34:28,784 --> 00:34:30,543
You're really bold, huh?

655
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:32,290
Are you disregarding our bond

656
00:34:32,519 --> 00:34:34,758
just because you want to butter him up?

657
00:34:36,288 --> 00:34:38,368
You're no longer
a member of the Luo Family.

658
00:34:38,396 --> 00:34:39,796
I'm no longer your third brother.

659
00:34:40,955 --> 00:34:41,995
Now,

660
00:34:42,756 --> 00:34:43,995
we're strangers.

661
00:34:50,236 --> 00:34:51,035
Fine.

662
00:34:53,196 --> 00:34:54,276
From now on,

663
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,159
you and I will sever

664
00:34:57,955 --> 00:34:59,115
our ties.

665
00:35:00,635 --> 00:35:01,396
Father,

666
00:35:03,475 --> 00:35:04,155
from now on,

667
00:35:04,155 --> 00:35:06,196
I don't want to have
any involvement with this person.

668
00:35:06,995 --> 00:35:08,155
I shall take my leave first.

669
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:09,919
Yining!

670
00:35:16,916 --> 00:35:18,115
From now on,

671
00:35:18,475 --> 00:35:20,075
if you dare to approach Yining again,

672
00:35:20,316 --> 00:35:21,916
I'll show you no mercy.

673
00:35:34,995 --> 00:35:37,396
Do you truly have nothing to say?

674
00:35:38,607 --> 00:35:39,687
That's right.

675
00:35:41,155 --> 00:35:41,995
Fine.

676
00:35:43,995 --> 00:35:44,916
Don't tell me

677
00:35:44,916 --> 00:35:46,756
you truly intend to serve Wang Yuan now?

678
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:51,895
Did you forget

679
00:35:52,435 --> 00:35:53,756
all the things

680
00:35:53,876 --> 00:35:55,796
that Wang Yuan had done to our family?

681
00:35:55,796 --> 00:35:58,356
Did you forget about
the promise you made to me?

682
00:36:00,115 --> 00:36:01,196
Grandma, I'm doing this

683
00:36:02,356 --> 00:36:04,115
to protect the Luo Family.

684
00:36:04,196 --> 00:36:05,555
I'm also keeping the promise

685
00:36:05,595 --> 00:36:07,236
I made to you.

686
00:36:10,555 --> 00:36:11,316
Someone!

687
00:36:12,995 --> 00:36:13,676
Yes, Old Madam.

688
00:36:13,676 --> 00:36:15,836
Drag him out and flog him 20 times!

689
00:36:15,955 --> 00:36:16,555
Yes, Old Madam.

690
00:36:29,952 --> 00:36:31,230
Chancellor Wang, Duke Ying is...

691
00:36:31,236 --> 00:36:32,995
Forget about the report.
I'm already here.

692
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:37,796
Chancellor Wang,
sorry for the interruption.

693
00:36:39,196 --> 00:36:40,716
Isn't this Duke Ying?

694
00:36:40,716 --> 00:36:42,196
Duke Ying,

695
00:36:42,196 --> 00:36:43,236
what brings you here today?

696
00:36:43,236 --> 00:36:44,836
Come. Let's have some tea.

697
00:36:46,475 --> 00:36:47,356
Are you surprised

698
00:36:48,676 --> 00:36:50,075
that

699
00:36:50,316 --> 00:36:51,676
I'm visiting you today?

700
00:36:51,995 --> 00:36:52,796
Right now,

701
00:36:52,796 --> 00:36:54,836
I should be in Hell
if your plan was a success,

702
00:36:54,836 --> 00:36:56,595
am I right?

703
00:36:59,555 --> 00:37:01,316
Duke Ying, what are you talking about?

704
00:37:02,155 --> 00:37:04,475
I don't understand at all.

705
00:37:04,676 --> 00:37:05,555
Is there

706
00:37:06,115 --> 00:37:07,916
a misunderstanding between us?

707
00:37:08,716 --> 00:37:10,236
You sent Luo Shenyuan

708
00:37:10,236 --> 00:37:11,995
to assassinate me, right?

709
00:37:19,196 --> 00:37:20,075
Chancellor Wang,

710
00:37:21,916 --> 00:37:23,555
I came here to give you a warning.

711
00:37:24,475 --> 00:37:25,836
From today onward,

712
00:37:26,396 --> 00:37:27,836
if anyone dares

713
00:37:28,155 --> 00:37:30,276
to target Duke Ying's Residence

714
00:37:30,796 --> 00:37:34,276
or the members of the Wei Family,

715
00:37:38,995 --> 00:37:41,316
they will end up like this chair.

716
00:37:42,075 --> 00:37:42,876
Farewell.

717
00:37:46,475 --> 00:37:48,635
Duke Ying is too arrogant
for his own good.

718
00:37:48,752 --> 00:37:50,310
He was lucky that he received an urgent

719
00:37:50,316 --> 00:37:51,756
report from the frontlines and didn't

720
00:37:51,756 --> 00:37:52,796
go to the temple.

721
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:54,592
If not, he would've been dead by now!

722
00:38:05,635 --> 00:38:07,955
Seems like Luo Shenyuan

723
00:38:08,432 --> 00:38:10,670
has fallen out with the Wei Family
for real this time.

724
00:38:10,995 --> 00:38:12,995
I heard that Wei Ling and his men

725
00:38:12,995 --> 00:38:15,196
caused a commotion
at the Luo's Residence today.

726
00:38:15,232 --> 00:38:16,150
After that, Luo Shenyuan

727
00:38:16,155 --> 00:38:17,276
was punished by his family.

728
00:38:17,276 --> 00:38:18,276
He was flogged.

729
00:38:19,836 --> 00:38:20,756
Say,

730
00:38:21,475 --> 00:38:23,356
Luo Shenyuan is indeed more devoted

731
00:38:23,356 --> 00:38:24,676
than Lu Jiaxue.

732
00:38:25,075 --> 00:38:26,276
Our men wouldn't have been

733
00:38:26,276 --> 00:38:27,316
wiped out

734
00:38:27,876 --> 00:38:28,995
had Lu Jiaxue

735
00:38:29,155 --> 00:38:30,396
not meddled with our affairs.

736
00:38:31,676 --> 00:38:33,075
This is unexpected indeed.

737
00:38:33,955 --> 00:38:37,635
Marquis Lu is a devoted man indeed.

738
00:38:45,075 --> 00:38:47,035
I've failed my mission.

739
00:38:47,995 --> 00:38:48,955
Chancellor Wang,

740
00:38:49,756 --> 00:38:51,316
please give me another chance.

741
00:38:51,995 --> 00:38:54,955
Now that you've failed,
I'm sure they've raised their guard.

742
00:38:55,475 --> 00:38:57,876
It'll be difficult for you
to strike again.

743
00:39:00,316 --> 00:39:01,876
Everything was supposed to be foolproof.

744
00:39:02,396 --> 00:39:04,475
But there were too many
unexpected occurrences.

745
00:39:06,155 --> 00:39:07,876
That old fool is lucky this time.

746
00:39:09,075 --> 00:39:10,676
He might be lucky this time,

747
00:39:11,115 --> 00:39:12,796
but he won't be as lucky next time.

748
00:39:12,876 --> 00:39:14,196
And, that Lu Jiaxue,

749
00:39:14,796 --> 00:39:17,115
I have no idea why he appeared.

750
00:39:17,475 --> 00:39:18,955
He risked his life to stop me too.

751
00:39:20,075 --> 00:39:23,196
Regarding that,
I have my own arrangements.

752
00:39:25,475 --> 00:39:27,435
Minister Luo, I heard
that you were injured.

753
00:39:27,995 --> 00:39:28,836
Someone.

754
00:39:29,115 --> 00:39:31,316
Bring us the best ointment for injuries.

755
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:32,144
Yes, Chancellor.

756
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:39,744
Thank you, Chancellor Wang.

757
00:39:41,396 --> 00:39:42,196
But,

758
00:39:43,836 --> 00:39:45,196
regarding Longquan Trading House...

759
00:39:45,635 --> 00:39:46,595
Don't worry.

760
00:39:48,034 --> 00:39:49,355
Shopkeeper Zheng

761
00:39:49,916 --> 00:39:51,555
is supposed to be released as we speak.

762
00:39:53,035 --> 00:39:54,276
From now on, Chancellor Wang,

763
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:56,528
Longquan Trading House
is at your disposal.

764
00:39:57,396 --> 00:39:58,435
I'll be depending on you

765
00:39:58,995 --> 00:40:00,196
in the future.

766
00:40:02,025 --> 00:40:03,065
All right.

767
00:40:03,969 --> 00:40:05,128
You should rest and recuperate.

768
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:07,328
You can wait for your
new letter of appointment

769
00:40:07,555 --> 00:40:09,555
after you've fully recovered,

770
00:40:11,184 --> 00:40:12,985
Vice Minister of
Imperial Court of Judicial.

771
00:40:14,676 --> 00:40:16,916
His Majesty has already
agreed to my proposal.

772
00:40:22,555 --> 00:40:25,115
Chancellor Wang,
I'll definitely follow your lead.

773
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:31,555
I shall take my leave now.

774
00:40:31,676 --> 00:40:32,276
All right.

775
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:43,952
Chancellor Wang, why are you
holding him in such high regard?

776
00:40:45,475 --> 00:40:47,196
We should always use sycophants

777
00:40:48,115 --> 00:40:49,316
to our advantage.

778
00:40:49,955 --> 00:40:51,196
If so, what should we do about

779
00:40:51,475 --> 00:40:52,396
Lu Jiaxue?

780
00:40:53,676 --> 00:40:56,155
We can't afford to let him
grow his power anymore.

781
00:40:58,316 --> 00:40:59,396
We have to address you

782
00:40:59,396 --> 00:41:01,236
as Vice Minister Luo in a few more days.

783
00:41:02,475 --> 00:41:03,676
Congratulations.

784
00:41:03,676 --> 00:41:04,475
That's right.

785
00:41:05,035 --> 00:41:06,676
My fellow peers,
please continue to guide me

786
00:41:06,836 --> 00:41:07,595
in the future.

787
00:41:08,836 --> 00:41:09,115
Here.

788
00:41:15,115 --> 00:41:16,316
- Marquis Lu?
- Marquis Lu?

789
00:41:16,396 --> 00:41:17,196
Minister Luo.

790
00:41:18,316 --> 00:41:19,475
May we speak in private?

791
00:41:29,248 --> 00:41:31,280
Minister Luo,
your strategies are brilliant indeed.

792
00:41:31,312 --> 00:41:32,768
You killed two birds with one stone.

793
00:41:33,035 --> 00:41:34,316
Marquis Lu, what makes you say so?

794
00:41:34,512 --> 00:41:35,830
You've proven your loyalty to him

795
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:37,584
and driven a wedge between us
at the same time.

796
00:41:37,676 --> 00:41:40,475
Marquis Lu, you overestimated me.

797
00:41:43,475 --> 00:41:45,435
Wang Yuan instructed you
to assassinate Duke Ying

798
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:47,155
just to see if you would fall out

799
00:41:47,756 --> 00:41:49,635
with the Wei Family for his sake, right?

800
00:41:51,984 --> 00:41:53,744
Marquis Lu, what are you talking about?

801
00:41:54,196 --> 00:41:55,356
I don't understand you at all.

802
00:41:56,196 --> 00:41:57,115
Your act

803
00:41:57,475 --> 00:41:58,676
was pretty convincing.

804
00:42:00,756 --> 00:42:02,756
However, not everyone is a fool

805
00:42:03,115 --> 00:42:04,916
who doesn't know what you're up to.

806
00:42:26,435 --> 00:42:27,236
Chancellor Wang.

807
00:42:28,876 --> 00:42:30,356
I thought this was a drinking session.

808
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:31,984
What were you two whispering about

809
00:42:32,155 --> 00:42:33,595
outside the room?

810
00:42:33,712 --> 00:42:35,150
Chancellor Wang, Marquis Lu blamed me

811
00:42:35,155 --> 00:42:36,756
for sabotaging
his relationship with you.

812
00:42:36,756 --> 00:42:38,796
I'm not as capable as he thinks.

813
00:42:38,876 --> 00:42:40,916
Marquis Lu has
too many responsibilities to bear.

814
00:42:41,075 --> 00:42:42,356
I'm sure he's overthinking things

815
00:42:42,836 --> 00:42:44,716
because he's tired.

816
00:42:44,995 --> 00:42:47,316
Why don't you put aside
your tasks for now?

817
00:42:48,512 --> 00:42:49,990
It's my honor to share your burdens.

818
00:42:50,155 --> 00:42:51,196
It's not tiring at all.

819
00:42:51,555 --> 00:42:53,396
But I feel sorry for you.

820
00:42:53,676 --> 00:42:55,196
You should stay out

821
00:42:55,316 --> 00:42:56,796
of the Imperial Guards' affairs for now.

822
00:42:56,995 --> 00:42:58,995
The weather is pretty nice.

823
00:42:59,475 --> 00:43:00,836
You should go on a trip

824
00:43:00,916 --> 00:43:01,916
and relax yourself.

825
00:43:04,656 --> 00:43:05,568
Yes, Chancellor Wang.

826
00:43:06,276 --> 00:43:08,356
Chancellor Wang, over here, please.

827
00:43:08,356 --> 00:43:08,995
