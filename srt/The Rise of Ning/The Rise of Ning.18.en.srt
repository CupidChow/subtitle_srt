00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,320
(Adapted from Wen Tan's novel "Chancellor
Training Handbook" from Jinjiang Literature)

3
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:38,884
=Episode 18=

4
00:01:53,806 --> 00:01:55,046
Aren't you focused?

5
00:01:56,966 --> 00:01:58,686
I need to be serious.

6
00:01:59,005 --> 00:02:00,645
I have the whole family to answer to.

7
00:02:00,845 --> 00:02:01,886
Can you understand it?

8
00:02:05,766 --> 00:02:07,606
I can understand each word,

9
00:02:08,005 --> 00:02:09,526
but when they're together,

10
00:02:09,845 --> 00:02:11,005
it makes my head spin.

11
00:02:11,486 --> 00:02:13,406
Alright, come over and rest for a bit.

12
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,900
Hello, Fugui.

13
00:02:19,605 --> 00:02:20,885
What's this tasty treat?

14
00:02:22,366 --> 00:02:23,406
Mutton Fat Pastry.

15
00:02:26,966 --> 00:02:27,765
Something's not right.

16
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,080
Where did you steal this from?

17
00:02:30,646 --> 00:02:31,686
Who said I stole it?

18
00:02:31,686 --> 00:02:33,526
My mother specifically
saved them for me.

19
00:02:33,565 --> 00:02:34,246
Your mother?

20
00:02:35,086 --> 00:02:36,725
I thought she wouldn't let you
eat anything.

21
00:02:37,765 --> 00:02:39,486
Maybe my method worked.

22
00:02:39,686 --> 00:02:41,246
Anyway, I can't seem to lose weight.

23
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,019
Besides, for someone like me,

24
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,605
slimming down wouldn't help me
find a husband.

25
00:02:44,605 --> 00:02:45,725
So she gave up.

26
00:02:45,725 --> 00:02:47,045
What do you mean, someone like you?

27
00:02:47,206 --> 00:02:49,486
Listen to me, don't give up on yourself.

28
00:02:49,565 --> 00:02:51,045
Look at me, for example.

29
00:02:51,165 --> 00:02:52,165
I'm not good at studying,

30
00:02:52,165 --> 00:02:53,725
but it doesn't stop me
from being clever.

31
00:02:53,725 --> 00:02:54,639
I can't be an official,

32
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,700
but it doesn't stop me
from bringing honor to my family.

33
00:02:56,768 --> 00:02:58,880
You are warm, kind, generous, and brave.

34
00:02:58,885 --> 00:03:00,445
I think you're a great friend.

35
00:03:00,765 --> 00:03:02,565
Are you complimenting me?

36
00:03:04,406 --> 00:03:05,206
Of course.

37
00:03:05,445 --> 00:03:06,799
You finally have something to eat,

38
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,210
and you're willing to share it with me.

39
00:03:08,565 --> 00:03:09,686
How could you be anything less?

40
00:03:14,086 --> 00:03:14,885
Have a taste.

41
00:03:16,486 --> 00:03:18,045
- You try some too.
- Sure.

42
00:03:22,605 --> 00:03:24,126
- Is it tasty?
- Delicious.

43
00:03:29,725 --> 00:03:30,845
The exam is coming up.

44
00:03:31,086 --> 00:03:33,005
The young masters' studies

45
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:34,765
are the top priority in this household.

46
00:03:34,806 --> 00:03:36,005
No one can slack off.

47
00:03:36,565 --> 00:03:38,045
Yilian, since you're close to Xuanyuan,

48
00:03:38,165 --> 00:03:40,806
you'll be responsible for urging him
to study.

49
00:03:41,767 --> 00:03:43,006
Yes, Mother.

50
00:03:44,845 --> 00:03:46,285
- Shenyuan, you...
- Mother.

51
00:03:47,765 --> 00:03:49,119
Let me take care of Third Brother.

52
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,080
I'll make sure he eats well,
drinks well, sleeps well

53
00:03:51,086 --> 00:03:52,086
and studies hard.

54
00:03:53,806 --> 00:03:54,885
Studying is important,

55
00:03:55,086 --> 00:03:57,325
but your health matters more.
Don't wear yourself out.

56
00:03:58,025 --> 00:03:58,826
Yes.

57
00:03:59,206 --> 00:03:59,966
Hairu,

58
00:04:00,366 --> 00:04:01,366
aren't you worried

59
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:02,646
that I'll exhaust myself?

60
00:04:03,966 --> 00:04:05,045
If you fall sick

61
00:04:05,406 --> 00:04:07,045
from studying,

62
00:04:07,088 --> 00:04:08,848
then I won't have anything
to worry about.

63
00:04:13,406 --> 00:04:14,565
I've been trying very hard...

64
00:04:14,565 --> 00:04:15,646
During this period,

65
00:04:15,806 --> 00:04:17,126
I'll personally arrange

66
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:18,726
your food and supplies.

67
00:04:19,486 --> 00:04:20,806
If there's anything else you need,

68
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:22,046
just come and tell me.

69
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,560
Yes, Mother.

70
00:04:53,686 --> 00:04:54,486
You may go.

71
00:04:55,525 --> 00:04:56,286
Yes.

72
00:04:59,008 --> 00:05:00,400
The autumn exams are approaching.

73
00:05:00,686 --> 00:05:02,806
The young masters will be busy
with their preparation.

74
00:05:03,246 --> 00:05:04,405
From today on,

75
00:05:04,405 --> 00:05:06,046
everyone needs to stay alert,

76
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:07,726
be extra cautious,

77
00:05:07,885 --> 00:05:09,325
and not act recklessly.

78
00:05:09,486 --> 00:05:10,726
No loud noises,

79
00:05:11,286 --> 00:05:12,686
and no unnecessary movements.

80
00:05:13,405 --> 00:05:14,565
Stay in your places,

81
00:05:14,846 --> 00:05:16,126
and do your duties.

82
00:05:16,565 --> 00:05:18,366
If anyone disrupts
the young masters' focus,

83
00:05:18,565 --> 00:05:20,085
you will be held responsible.

84
00:05:20,926 --> 00:05:22,126
Got it?

85
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,800
Yes, Madam.

86
00:05:24,405 --> 00:05:26,405
What did I just say?
Have you already forgotten?

87
00:05:26,445 --> 00:05:27,606
Keep your voices down.

88
00:05:27,686 --> 00:05:28,565
Keep it down,

89
00:05:28,645 --> 00:05:29,525
remember?

90
00:05:43,002 --> 00:05:43,762
Here,

91
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,660
you must be hungry.

92
00:05:45,965 --> 00:05:46,765
Thank you, Mother.

93
00:06:21,085 --> 00:06:21,885
Hand it over.

94
00:06:23,892 --> 00:06:24,651
Give it to me.

95
00:06:28,405 --> 00:06:30,885
You useless thing.

96
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,000
Young Master,

97
00:06:43,286 --> 00:06:44,726
Senior Daoyan is in trouble again.

98
00:06:45,085 --> 00:06:47,445
He came to congratulate me
on entering the family register,

99
00:06:48,081 --> 00:06:50,081
and to wish me luck in the exams.

100
00:06:50,464 --> 00:06:52,480
Also, the anniversary
of our mentor's passing is near.

101
00:06:52,733 --> 00:06:53,773
He asked me to offer

102
00:06:53,888 --> 00:06:55,560
a cup of wine to our mentor
on his behalf.

103
00:06:56,158 --> 00:06:58,079
Seeing your troubled expression,

104
00:06:58,166 --> 00:06:59,726
I thought something bad happened.

105
00:06:59,965 --> 00:07:01,366
You still need to inform

106
00:07:01,565 --> 00:07:02,645
our brothers

107
00:07:02,765 --> 00:07:03,565
to keep a close watch

108
00:07:04,565 --> 00:07:05,565
for the next few days.

109
00:07:06,085 --> 00:07:07,644
Are you worried Senior Daoyan

110
00:07:07,645 --> 00:07:08,885
will raise a grievance again?

111
00:07:09,488 --> 00:07:11,920
The case review will happen
before the exam results are released.

112
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,671
It's better to stay cautious.

113
00:07:15,712 --> 00:07:16,880
We need to clear his name,

114
00:07:17,205 --> 00:07:18,606
but also protect our family.

115
00:07:19,486 --> 00:07:20,246
Understood.

116
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:22,366
Any progress on the pufferfish poison?

117
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,720
Just tell me.

118
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,160
No updates for now.

119
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:30,565
Seventh Lady did come over a few times,

120
00:07:30,565 --> 00:07:31,565
but I turned her down.

121
00:07:31,565 --> 00:07:33,286
I feel kind of bad, actually.

122
00:07:34,565 --> 00:07:35,366
Young Master,

123
00:07:35,606 --> 00:07:37,166
are you still planning

124
00:07:37,205 --> 00:07:39,085
to stay in and study, avoiding visitors?

125
00:07:39,286 --> 00:07:40,806
All the young masters of the Luo family

126
00:07:40,806 --> 00:07:41,846
are avoiding visitors,

127
00:07:41,846 --> 00:07:43,205
why should I fall behind?

128
00:07:43,686 --> 00:07:45,885
Besides, who would visit us here?

129
00:07:46,405 --> 00:07:47,606
The most frequent visitor

130
00:07:47,606 --> 00:07:48,606
is Seventh Lady.

131
00:07:48,965 --> 00:07:50,046
It's a good thing, actually.

132
00:07:50,205 --> 00:07:51,765
Young Master, your one-sided affection

133
00:07:51,765 --> 00:07:53,005
is a dead-end game.

134
00:07:53,166 --> 00:07:54,726
In the end, you're only
hurting yourself.

135
00:07:55,445 --> 00:07:56,286
Go make some tea.

136
00:07:56,606 --> 00:07:58,286
- Are you having tea?
- For you.

137
00:07:58,606 --> 00:08:00,445
You've been nagging nonstop.
Aren't you thirsty?

138
00:08:10,645 --> 00:08:12,686
Seventh Lady, you're here again.

139
00:08:12,686 --> 00:08:14,366
I brought something for Third Brother.

140
00:08:15,085 --> 00:08:16,606
He's still studying, right?

141
00:08:16,806 --> 00:08:18,290
Yes, he's been up since morning

142
00:08:18,294 --> 00:08:19,494
reviewing his lessons.

143
00:08:19,645 --> 00:08:21,885
Your Young Master still isn't
receiving visitors today?

144
00:08:22,286 --> 00:08:24,645
I believe he isn't, no.

145
00:08:25,565 --> 00:08:27,126
Then please pass this tonic soup

146
00:08:27,205 --> 00:08:28,246
to him for me.

147
00:08:28,565 --> 00:08:29,686
I'll be going now.

148
00:08:29,799 --> 00:08:31,726
Thank you, Seventh Lady.
You're very thoughtful.

149
00:08:35,168 --> 00:08:36,310
Young Lady, are you alright?

150
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,680
Seventh Lady, are you okay?

151
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,120
Did you twist your ankle?

152
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:46,300
Did you twist it?

153
00:08:47,489 --> 00:08:48,249
Let me take a look.

154
00:08:58,726 --> 00:08:59,726
I'm fine.

155
00:09:11,246 --> 00:09:13,645
Third Brother, why have you been
avoiding me lately?

156
00:09:13,846 --> 00:09:15,966
I'm not avoiding you,
I'm just busy with my studies.

157
00:09:15,966 --> 00:09:16,805
You're lying.

158
00:09:16,848 --> 00:09:18,500
You just don't want to drink
my tonic soup.

159
00:09:22,606 --> 00:09:24,606
I've really had enough tonic soups.

160
00:09:24,685 --> 00:09:25,525
You're weak.

161
00:09:27,405 --> 00:09:28,206
You drink it.

162
00:09:28,911 --> 00:09:30,391
How could you have had enough?

163
00:09:30,685 --> 00:09:31,885
You read every day,

164
00:09:31,885 --> 00:09:33,446
taxing both your mind and body.

165
00:09:33,456 --> 00:09:34,600
You need constant nourishment.

166
00:09:34,606 --> 00:09:36,486
Alright, I'll drink it later, okay?

167
00:09:36,726 --> 00:09:38,599
I've already taken the tonics
Mother gave me.

168
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,903
Caterpillar fungus and tendon soup

169
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,281
have to be drunk hot.

170
00:09:41,405 --> 00:09:43,925
It's my personal recipe.

171
00:09:43,925 --> 00:09:46,246
It contains hundred-year-old ginseng
and angelica.

172
00:09:46,566 --> 00:09:47,685
Alright, put it here.

173
00:09:47,685 --> 00:09:48,726
I'll help myself.

174
00:09:49,294 --> 00:09:50,054
It's okay.

175
00:09:50,165 --> 00:09:51,045
Let me tell you,

176
00:09:51,285 --> 00:09:53,805
even Luo Shanyuan can't eat
on his own now.

177
00:09:53,805 --> 00:09:55,445
He has someone turning pages for him

178
00:09:55,446 --> 00:09:57,005
while feeding him at the same time.

179
00:09:57,165 --> 00:09:59,045
You deserve the same treatment.

180
00:09:59,079 --> 00:09:59,838
Here.

181
00:10:05,165 --> 00:10:06,846
- Delicious, isn't it?
- Delicious.

182
00:10:07,846 --> 00:10:09,206
Your nose is bleeding.

183
00:10:09,765 --> 00:10:10,525
Quick, quick!

184
00:10:11,005 --> 00:10:12,126
Why is your nose bleeding?

185
00:10:12,165 --> 00:10:13,525
- Shao'an.
- Shao'an.

186
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:15,486
Third Brother has a nosebleed.

187
00:10:15,576 --> 00:10:17,726
- Shao'an, hurry, get some water.
- Ouch...

188
00:10:20,366 --> 00:10:21,165
I know what it is.

189
00:10:21,206 --> 00:10:23,566
It must be because the soup
is too strong.

190
00:10:23,566 --> 00:10:24,805
Yes, stop drinking it.

191
00:10:24,805 --> 00:10:26,285
I'll have Qing Qu bring herbal medicine

192
00:10:26,285 --> 00:10:27,366
to cool you down.

193
00:10:27,366 --> 00:10:28,246
Wait here.

194
00:10:29,285 --> 00:10:30,045
Wait...

195
00:10:30,566 --> 00:10:31,366
What is it?

196
00:10:36,472 --> 00:10:37,591
I beg you.

197
00:10:38,405 --> 00:10:39,805
Any updates on the poison?

198
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:40,446
The poison?

199
00:10:42,086 --> 00:10:43,246
No progress yet.

200
00:10:43,246 --> 00:10:45,326
Once there's news,
I'll tell you immediately.

201
00:10:45,765 --> 00:10:46,525
Alright.

202
00:10:47,135 --> 00:10:48,066
Just wait here.

203
00:10:48,074 --> 00:10:49,446
I'll go get you some medicine.

204
00:10:49,585 --> 00:10:50,949
No need to go.

205
00:10:51,685 --> 00:10:52,885
Qing Qu!

206
00:10:56,384 --> 00:10:58,032
(Haitang Abode)
The exams are approaching,

207
00:10:58,086 --> 00:11:00,086
I assume everyone in the household
is busy

208
00:11:00,086 --> 00:11:02,086
studying day and night.

209
00:11:02,086 --> 00:11:03,667
Yes, we've been quietly watching

210
00:11:03,677 --> 00:11:05,077
these past few days.

211
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,280
Whether it's the principal home

212
00:11:06,285 --> 00:11:07,566
or the Bilan Pavilion,

213
00:11:07,726 --> 00:11:10,005
everyone is remaining at their posts

214
00:11:10,032 --> 00:11:11,840
and keeping an eye on
the young masters' studies.

215
00:11:11,846 --> 00:11:13,846
The principal home is especially busy

216
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,616
in anticipation of the
First Master's return.

217
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:16,880
Young Lady, how should we proceed

218
00:11:16,885 --> 00:11:18,366
with the investigation?

219
00:11:19,885 --> 00:11:20,685
Yining,

220
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,365
I've loved eating this
since I was young,

221
00:11:22,366 --> 00:11:24,405
but it's so rarely available
in the capital.

222
00:11:27,405 --> 00:11:28,206
Xue Zhi,

223
00:11:28,486 --> 00:11:29,726
find a servant

224
00:11:29,726 --> 00:11:31,246
and have him pick some loquats.

225
00:11:31,685 --> 00:11:33,045
I want to make loquat custard.

226
00:11:33,086 --> 00:11:35,885
Young Lady, you're making loquat custard
for the Third Young Master again?

227
00:11:48,086 --> 00:11:49,885
Lin Mao...

228
00:11:51,405 --> 00:11:53,045
Lin Mao, what are you doing?

229
00:11:54,405 --> 00:11:55,446
Why are you here?

230
00:11:56,246 --> 00:11:56,925
Didn't you know?

231
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:58,639
You're not allowed to visit now.

232
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,360
You're too conspicuous. Hurry.

233
00:12:15,329 --> 00:12:16,408
What's all this?

234
00:12:16,566 --> 00:12:18,566
Some tricks my sister came up with

235
00:12:18,645 --> 00:12:20,045
to force me to study.

236
00:12:21,165 --> 00:12:23,566
Fugui, why have you gotten so thin?

237
00:12:23,805 --> 00:12:24,846
It gets one bite of bean cake

238
00:12:24,846 --> 00:12:26,422
for every page I memorize.

239
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:27,446
How can he not get thin?

240
00:12:27,885 --> 00:12:28,765
Poor thing.

241
00:12:29,645 --> 00:12:31,045
How about I take Fugui away?

242
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:31,968
If he stays with you...

243
00:12:32,486 --> 00:12:34,126
You're not planning to turn him

244
00:12:34,126 --> 00:12:35,246
into a stew, are you?

245
00:12:35,246 --> 00:12:37,726
What did you say?
How could you think that of me?

246
00:12:37,846 --> 00:12:38,885
Don't touch him.

247
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,000
Keep your hands to yourself.

248
00:12:41,005 --> 00:12:43,126
I'm doing this for your own good.

249
00:12:43,446 --> 00:12:44,525
Fine.

250
00:12:44,726 --> 00:12:45,606
I was wrong.

251
00:12:45,685 --> 00:12:46,606
You're the best.

252
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:48,885
Alright, I'll leave Fugui to you.

253
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,352
Quick, take him away.

254
00:12:50,384 --> 00:12:51,584
- Take good care of him.
- Sure.

255
00:12:53,086 --> 00:12:53,846
Yixiu.

256
00:12:54,645 --> 00:12:55,405
Also, stay

257
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,976
in the residence
for the next few days.

258
00:12:57,086 --> 00:12:59,005
Avoid running into unsavory people.

259
00:12:59,566 --> 00:13:01,246
What unsavory people?

260
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:02,685
Like that person from before,

261
00:13:02,704 --> 00:13:04,080
the one who claimed he couldn't eat.

262
00:13:04,246 --> 00:13:05,566
These noblemen love

263
00:13:05,566 --> 00:13:07,606
to make up stories to trick young girls.

264
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:08,820
Don't believe them.

265
00:13:09,126 --> 00:13:10,885
Maybe he saw you bullying me

266
00:13:10,885 --> 00:13:12,885
and was just trying to stand up for me.

267
00:13:13,645 --> 00:13:15,005
Okay, I'm taking Fugui away.

268
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:20,525
See you.

269
00:13:21,086 --> 00:13:21,846
Be careful.

270
00:13:22,285 --> 00:13:23,045
Don't worry.

271
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:41,366
Where's Fugui?

272
00:13:44,606 --> 00:13:46,126
Where did Fugui go?

273
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:50,486
Maybe I was too focused
on reading earlier,

274
00:13:50,486 --> 00:13:52,566
and Fugui let himself out to play.

275
00:13:55,966 --> 00:13:57,285
If that's the case,

276
00:13:57,446 --> 00:13:59,885
Fugui is more suited to take the exams
than you are?

277
00:14:02,566 --> 00:14:05,326
You saw everything, didn't you?

278
00:14:08,005 --> 00:14:08,765
Mao,

279
00:14:09,645 --> 00:14:11,486
Madam Chen is arrogant.

280
00:14:11,645 --> 00:14:13,606
She's polite to me on the surface,

281
00:14:13,765 --> 00:14:15,326
but I know that deep down,

282
00:14:15,366 --> 00:14:16,685
she doesn't think much of me.

283
00:14:16,726 --> 00:14:18,285
Why would she look down on you?

284
00:14:18,486 --> 00:14:19,359
Just because her family

285
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,080
has produced a few
Hanlin Academy scholars?

286
00:14:21,086 --> 00:14:23,126
We should look down on her instead.

287
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:25,685
I will just nod in greeting
when I see her,

288
00:14:25,685 --> 00:14:27,326
and not take anything personally.

289
00:14:27,446 --> 00:14:29,126
If we were closer,

290
00:14:29,486 --> 00:14:30,685
she probably

291
00:14:30,685 --> 00:14:32,206
wouldn't be so friendly.

292
00:14:36,726 --> 00:14:39,086
That's right, I went early this morning
to pray,

293
00:14:39,126 --> 00:14:40,525
and I forgot to give him this.

294
00:14:41,606 --> 00:14:42,726
Where's my head at?

295
00:14:44,206 --> 00:14:45,726
Hairu, what...

296
00:14:45,726 --> 00:14:46,885
What are you trying to say?

297
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:49,126
Be careful with Yixiu.

298
00:14:50,005 --> 00:14:52,405
What do you mean, be careful with her?

299
00:14:55,543 --> 00:14:57,463
Hairu, don't overthink it.

300
00:14:57,765 --> 00:14:59,846
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

301
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:02,086
It's fine if you can pass the exams.

302
00:15:02,126 --> 00:15:04,405
Otherwise, you should forget about it.

303
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:06,438
Hairu, I've always seen Yixiu

304
00:15:06,454 --> 00:15:07,454
as my niece.

305
00:15:08,566 --> 00:15:11,206
You know me, I've always liked
beautiful things.

306
00:15:11,246 --> 00:15:12,405
But Yixiu is chubby,

307
00:15:12,405 --> 00:15:13,446
not into dressing up,

308
00:15:13,566 --> 00:15:15,566
and all she does is chatter
and eat all day.

309
00:15:16,005 --> 00:15:17,405
How could I possibly like her?

310
00:15:17,685 --> 00:15:18,925
There's no need for you

311
00:15:18,925 --> 00:15:20,326
to talk about her like that.

312
00:15:20,846 --> 00:15:21,645
Remember,

313
00:15:21,885 --> 00:15:23,566
be a good uncle to her.

314
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:26,720
You're right.

315
00:15:27,005 --> 00:15:28,206
You're slim, she's chubby.

316
00:15:28,246 --> 00:15:29,726
You two are not compatible.

317
00:15:31,606 --> 00:15:33,525
You dirty liar.

318
00:15:33,685 --> 00:15:35,726
I'll strangle you.

319
00:15:36,606 --> 00:15:37,366
Yixiu.

320
00:15:38,966 --> 00:15:40,486
I was just about to look for you.

321
00:15:40,885 --> 00:15:42,405
You scared me. What is it?

322
00:15:42,765 --> 00:15:44,206
Who made you so angry?

323
00:15:44,566 --> 00:15:46,285
It's nothing. He's not worth mentioning.

324
00:15:46,566 --> 00:15:47,726
So, what's up?

325
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,049
I made some loquat custard,

326
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:50,285
and I thought you'd like to share.

327
00:15:50,285 --> 00:15:52,525
Would I? You make the best
loquat custard.

328
00:15:52,525 --> 00:15:53,765
- Let's go.
- Yes, let's.

329
00:15:55,486 --> 00:15:56,246
Let's go.

330
00:16:00,606 --> 00:16:01,366
Yining,

331
00:16:01,405 --> 00:16:03,246
your loquat custard is even better

332
00:16:03,246 --> 00:16:04,086
than Liuhe Tavern's.

333
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:06,180
This is really the only thing
I'm good at.

334
00:16:07,405 --> 00:16:08,206
Yixiu,

335
00:16:08,805 --> 00:16:10,126
next time we get a chance,

336
00:16:10,165 --> 00:16:11,645
let's go to Liuhe Tavern

337
00:16:11,645 --> 00:16:13,045
and try their pufferfish.

338
00:16:13,525 --> 00:16:14,405
Sure.

339
00:16:15,765 --> 00:16:16,525
By the way,

340
00:16:17,366 --> 00:16:18,606
you told me before

341
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:20,486
that you used to love pufferfish
as a child.

342
00:16:20,566 --> 00:16:22,165
But here in Luo's Residence,

343
00:16:22,206 --> 00:16:23,805
we rarely get the chance to eat it.

344
00:16:24,246 --> 00:16:25,645
When did you have it before?

345
00:16:25,805 --> 00:16:27,229
That was when my mother and I

346
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,719
visited the Chen family.

347
00:16:28,765 --> 00:16:29,805
But that was many years ago.

348
00:16:29,805 --> 00:16:31,126
I remember that year,

349
00:16:31,165 --> 00:16:33,726
my grandpa hosted
an important guest.

350
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:35,366
He brought in a chef from the south

351
00:16:35,405 --> 00:16:36,726
specializing in pufferfish.

352
00:16:36,726 --> 00:16:38,086
But my mother wouldn't let me try it.

353
00:16:38,285 --> 00:16:40,326
I secretly took a bite.
It was so delicious.

354
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:41,846
I still remember it to this day.

355
00:16:49,285 --> 00:16:50,045
What's wrong?

356
00:16:50,086 --> 00:16:51,925
You don't look well.
Are you feeling sick?

357
00:16:52,285 --> 00:16:53,045
No, I'm fine.

358
00:16:53,405 --> 00:16:54,566
If you like it,

359
00:16:54,566 --> 00:16:56,126
I'll make more for you next time.

360
00:16:56,206 --> 00:16:57,885
Also, I won't tell your mother

361
00:16:57,925 --> 00:16:59,645
about you sneaking

362
00:16:59,966 --> 00:17:01,645
the loquat custard today.

363
00:17:01,966 --> 00:17:02,888
She mustn't know,

364
00:17:02,909 --> 00:17:04,229
or else I'm done for.

365
00:17:10,366 --> 00:17:11,846
Young Lady, what's on your mind?

366
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:14,205
I was just thinking,

367
00:17:14,485 --> 00:17:15,566
if it really was her,

368
00:17:16,485 --> 00:17:17,885
why did she do it?

369
00:17:21,725 --> 00:17:22,485
Back then,

370
00:17:22,925 --> 00:17:24,766
my father divorced my mother

371
00:17:25,645 --> 00:17:27,725
because of Mistress Qiao.

372
00:17:27,806 --> 00:17:30,445
My mother lived in a
separate residence ever since.

373
00:17:31,205 --> 00:17:32,526
They had no interactions.

374
00:17:33,405 --> 00:17:34,885
What kind of grudge could there be?

375
00:17:35,286 --> 00:17:37,526
True. If it was about taking control
of the household,

376
00:17:37,725 --> 00:17:39,846
she would have targeted
Mistress Qiao first.

377
00:17:41,885 --> 00:17:43,445
Yixiu has always been so kind to me,

378
00:17:44,245 --> 00:17:45,366
yet here I am,

379
00:17:45,725 --> 00:17:46,925
trying to dig for answers.

380
00:17:47,806 --> 00:17:49,046
Don't think like that, Young Lady.

381
00:17:49,445 --> 00:17:51,205
You're just searching for the truth.

382
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,600
Yes,

383
00:17:54,245 --> 00:17:55,925
I just want the truth.

384
00:17:57,806 --> 00:18:00,006
Qing Qu, please help me find

385
00:18:00,006 --> 00:18:01,885
the chef the Chen family
hired back then.

386
00:18:03,725 --> 00:18:04,806
Understood, Young Lady.

387
00:18:05,405 --> 00:18:07,046
Young Lady, you should rest now.

388
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,165
The doctor said you shouldn't overthink.

389
00:18:09,205 --> 00:18:10,245
It could harm your health.

390
00:18:20,858 --> 00:18:22,952
(Luo Chengwen)

391
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:36,710
(East Street)

392
00:18:43,925 --> 00:18:45,526
Mr. Innkeeper...

393
00:18:45,526 --> 00:18:46,405
Please listen to me.

394
00:18:47,405 --> 00:18:48,925
I'm not trying to cheat you.

395
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:49,846
My money...

396
00:18:49,872 --> 00:18:51,350
- My money...
- If you have no money,

397
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,759
why stay at an inn?

398
00:18:53,086 --> 00:18:55,046
Please give me a few more days, alright?

399
00:18:56,286 --> 00:18:57,725
Everyone, help me, please.

400
00:18:58,405 --> 00:18:59,445
Someone, please help me.

401
00:18:59,606 --> 00:19:00,925
I really didn't owe any money.

402
00:19:01,326 --> 00:19:02,086
I swear...

403
00:19:03,405 --> 00:19:04,885
My money was stolen.

404
00:19:05,245 --> 00:19:06,685
I had money

405
00:19:06,725 --> 00:19:07,925
when I checked in.

406
00:19:07,925 --> 00:19:09,685
Enough, I'm not arguing with you.

407
00:19:09,766 --> 00:19:10,559
Either pay up

408
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,900
or come with me to the magistrate.

409
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,680
(Yang Qinghua)
Please, just give me a few more days.

410
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,445
I'm skilled with needlework,

411
00:19:15,485 --> 00:19:16,885
I can definitely earn the money.

412
00:19:17,205 --> 00:19:18,405
We're going to the magistrate.

413
00:19:19,526 --> 00:19:20,286
Hold on.

414
00:19:28,422 --> 00:19:30,223
What's the matter, sir?

415
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:32,475
How much does this young lady owe you?

416
00:19:32,566 --> 00:19:33,566
I'll pay for her.

417
00:19:38,725 --> 00:19:39,844
Is this enough?

418
00:19:40,366 --> 00:19:41,126
Yes, it's enough.

419
00:19:41,566 --> 00:19:43,526
Looks like it's your lucky day.

420
00:19:43,566 --> 00:19:44,645
Alright people, move along.

421
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,719
Nothing to see here, move along.

422
00:19:46,725 --> 00:19:47,405
Move along.

423
00:19:55,445 --> 00:19:56,725
No need to thank me, Young Lady.

424
00:20:00,925 --> 00:20:02,326
My name is Yang Qinghua.

425
00:20:02,925 --> 00:20:04,485
Thank you, sir, for your help.

426
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:06,725
May I know your name?

427
00:20:06,846 --> 00:20:08,326
I'd like to write a note

428
00:20:08,405 --> 00:20:10,526
so I can repay you someday.

429
00:20:11,566 --> 00:20:12,366
No thanks.

430
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:15,126
It's fate that we met today.

431
00:20:15,366 --> 00:20:16,885
Since you're penniless now,

432
00:20:16,885 --> 00:20:18,685
please take this, you'll need it.

433
00:20:18,766 --> 00:20:20,046
- No…
- Take it.

434
00:20:20,086 --> 00:20:21,606
I can't accept this money.

435
00:20:21,685 --> 00:20:23,245
Please, tell me your name,

436
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,640
so I can repay you one day.

437
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:25,961
Otherwise,

438
00:20:28,925 --> 00:20:30,205
I'll keep kneeling here.

439
00:20:31,286 --> 00:20:33,205
Miss Yang, please stand up.

440
00:20:34,806 --> 00:20:35,566
Alright.

441
00:20:36,566 --> 00:20:37,645
As you wish.

442
00:20:42,205 --> 00:20:44,239
Miss Yang, my surname is Luo.

443
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,080
I live in the Luo Residence
in the east of the city.

444
00:20:46,086 --> 00:20:47,526
If you ever need help,

445
00:20:47,685 --> 00:20:49,126
feel free to come find me.

446
00:20:49,245 --> 00:20:51,405
Thank you, Mr. Luo, for your kindness.

447
00:21:01,399 --> 00:21:03,164
(Chengjing Hall)

448
00:21:10,675 --> 00:21:11,475
Mother.

449
00:21:12,245 --> 00:21:14,485
Please accept my greeting, Mother.

450
00:21:14,725 --> 00:21:15,485
My son,

451
00:21:15,606 --> 00:21:17,725
Chengwen, get up.

452
00:21:19,885 --> 00:21:20,645
Chengwen...

453
00:21:21,725 --> 00:21:24,405
I've waited day and night
for your return.

454
00:21:25,245 --> 00:21:26,685
It's been so many years.

455
00:21:28,175 --> 00:21:31,256
Now that you're back, I'm happy.

456
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,200
Your journey back

457
00:21:35,405 --> 00:21:36,326
must have been difficult.

458
00:21:36,806 --> 00:21:37,566
No.

459
00:21:38,245 --> 00:21:39,405
It was not difficult at all.

460
00:21:39,904 --> 00:21:41,840
Now that I've been reassigned
back to the capital,

461
00:21:41,888 --> 00:21:43,920
I'm thrilled that our family
can be together again.

462
00:21:44,846 --> 00:21:47,405
I'm truly happy.

463
00:21:48,645 --> 00:21:49,526
I understand.

464
00:21:50,846 --> 00:21:52,245
Mother, please sit down.

465
00:22:05,526 --> 00:22:06,286
My dear wife.

466
00:22:07,885 --> 00:22:08,685
My dear husband.

467
00:22:11,645 --> 00:22:12,526
Yiyu, Yixiu,

468
00:22:12,925 --> 00:22:14,205
you've both grown up so much.

469
00:22:15,006 --> 00:22:16,846
Greetings, Father.

470
00:22:16,846 --> 00:22:18,205
Good, good.

471
00:22:24,205 --> 00:22:26,366
By the way, where is Shanyuan?

472
00:22:28,245 --> 00:22:29,606
He's studying.

473
00:22:29,725 --> 00:22:30,965
The autumn exams are coming up,

474
00:22:31,205 --> 00:22:33,286
so I asked him to focus on his studies.

475
00:22:33,405 --> 00:22:36,126
He'll come to greet you at dinnertime.

476
00:22:36,286 --> 00:22:38,566
It's good that he's studying.

477
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,552
Son, sit down. Let's talk.

478
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,400
Sure.

479
00:22:57,522 --> 00:22:58,522
She is…

480
00:23:01,955 --> 00:23:03,356
Greetings, Uncle.

481
00:23:03,896 --> 00:23:05,457
That's Yining.

482
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,760
She's back from the other courtyard.

483
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,121
You don't recognize her?

484
00:23:11,388 --> 00:23:12,509
It is Yining.

485
00:23:13,228 --> 00:23:14,228
She's all grown up.

486
00:23:15,349 --> 00:23:17,349
- She looks more and more like her.
- Yes.

487
00:23:18,148 --> 00:23:21,428
I also think she resembles
her mother more and more.

488
00:23:24,349 --> 00:23:25,868
There's nothing like being home

489
00:23:26,188 --> 00:23:27,468
and having a family

490
00:23:27,628 --> 00:23:28,868
to look after you.

491
00:23:29,188 --> 00:23:30,388
That's right, Uncle.

492
00:23:30,549 --> 00:23:31,663
Now that I'm back,

493
00:23:31,664 --> 00:23:33,140
I won't go back to the side yard again.

494
00:23:33,309 --> 00:23:35,188
I want to spend more time
with Grandma.

495
00:23:45,139 --> 00:23:46,339
Greetings, Mother.

496
00:23:50,069 --> 00:23:51,109
Welcome back, Chengwen.

497
00:23:51,109 --> 00:23:52,989
Chengzhang, it's been a long time.

498
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:54,872
Chengzhang,

499
00:23:55,388 --> 00:23:57,468
you came back just in time.

500
00:23:57,668 --> 00:24:00,509
Why don't you two brothers catch up?

501
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:05,269
Yes, Mother.

502
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:08,945
(Luo's Residence)

503
00:24:14,749 --> 00:24:15,549
My dear.

504
00:24:17,228 --> 00:24:19,309
You're still busy this late?

505
00:24:20,188 --> 00:24:21,388
There's always work to do.

506
00:24:21,948 --> 00:24:23,708
What brings you here?

507
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:26,948
I specially prepared

508
00:24:27,109 --> 00:24:29,029
some calming tea for you.

509
00:24:29,708 --> 00:24:31,948
You've had a long day of traveling.

510
00:24:32,148 --> 00:24:33,029
It must've been tiring.

511
00:24:38,868 --> 00:24:40,069
Over the years,

512
00:24:40,269 --> 00:24:41,789
you've managed the household,

513
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:43,228
taken care of my mother,

514
00:24:43,668 --> 00:24:44,989
and raised our children.

515
00:24:45,309 --> 00:24:46,509
You've had it the hardest.

516
00:24:46,509 --> 00:24:47,989
Please, don't say that.

517
00:24:48,549 --> 00:24:50,708
It's what I'm supposed to do.

518
00:24:52,228 --> 00:24:53,509
After you've had your tea,

519
00:24:54,148 --> 00:24:55,589
please come and rest.

520
00:24:59,549 --> 00:25:01,388
I still have some work to finish.

521
00:25:01,789 --> 00:25:04,109
I'll stay in the study room tonight.

522
00:25:04,349 --> 00:25:06,509
Why don't you turn in first?

523
00:25:08,188 --> 00:25:10,029
Then I won't disturb you.

524
00:25:10,668 --> 00:25:11,428
My dear,

525
00:25:11,829 --> 00:25:13,908
please take care of your health.

526
00:25:27,178 --> 00:25:28,858
Wait, give me the lamp.

527
00:25:30,165 --> 00:25:31,749
- You may leave.
- Yes.

528
00:25:33,549 --> 00:25:35,628
Why is the First Master
acting like that?

529
00:25:37,708 --> 00:25:38,509
Ms. Zhao.

530
00:25:39,388 --> 00:25:41,468
I feel sorry for you, that's all.

531
00:25:41,908 --> 00:25:44,269
You've endured so much here.

532
00:25:44,736 --> 00:25:46,620
You went through all trouble
with the Chen family

533
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:48,029
to get him reassigned here,

534
00:25:48,309 --> 00:25:50,908
yet he treats you like an outsider.

535
00:25:50,908 --> 00:25:52,668
He doesn't show you any concern.

536
00:25:55,509 --> 00:25:57,188
His indifference towards me

537
00:25:57,708 --> 00:25:59,509
is nothing new.

538
00:26:00,228 --> 00:26:02,388
I've long since gotten used to it.

539
00:26:02,388 --> 00:26:05,029
As long as his promotion

540
00:26:05,148 --> 00:26:08,029
benefits Shanyuan and the girls.

541
00:26:08,309 --> 00:26:10,388
All I can ask for

542
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,320
is a bright future for my children.

543
00:26:13,269 --> 00:26:14,029
Nothing else

544
00:26:15,428 --> 00:26:16,789
matters to me.

545
00:26:22,955 --> 00:26:24,316
Greetings, Mother.

546
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:25,589
You're too formal.

547
00:26:25,908 --> 00:26:27,428
We're family.

548
00:26:27,708 --> 00:26:30,388
There's no need for formalities.
Have a seat.

549
00:26:30,908 --> 00:26:32,668
- Thank you, Mother.
- Please sit.

550
00:26:36,908 --> 00:26:39,069
The Chens played a big role

551
00:26:39,228 --> 00:26:41,829
in getting you reassigned
back to the capital,

552
00:26:42,109 --> 00:26:44,029
especially your wife.

553
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:47,062
She worked tirelessly
to make this happen.

554
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,401
It wasn't easy.

555
00:26:48,509 --> 00:26:51,228
You must thank her properly.

556
00:26:52,428 --> 00:26:54,509
I will remember your advice.

557
00:26:54,549 --> 00:26:57,789
Chengwen, now that you're an official
in the capital,

558
00:26:57,829 --> 00:27:00,388
you must always speak and act

559
00:27:00,388 --> 00:27:02,349
with utmost diligence.

560
00:27:02,388 --> 00:27:03,628
Yes, Mother, I understand.

561
00:27:07,228 --> 00:27:08,549
My dear, you have indeed worked hard

562
00:27:08,989 --> 00:27:10,309
all these years.

563
00:27:10,388 --> 00:27:12,989
For that, I thank you.

564
00:27:13,188 --> 00:27:14,789
There's no need to thank me.

565
00:27:15,228 --> 00:27:17,989
It is simply my duty.

566
00:27:23,908 --> 00:27:25,147
Old Madam,

567
00:27:25,148 --> 00:27:26,549
there's a woman outside

568
00:27:26,549 --> 00:27:29,029
insisting on repaying Mr. Luo.

569
00:27:29,056 --> 00:27:30,460
She's been kneeling there for a while.

570
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:32,100
She refuses to leave,
no matter what we say.

571
00:27:32,388 --> 00:27:33,188
Repayment?

572
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:36,228
Now, that's an unusual story.

573
00:27:36,228 --> 00:27:37,450
Did you ask

574
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,121
which Mr. Luo she's looking for?

575
00:27:41,509 --> 00:27:42,428
Could it be her?

576
00:27:44,468 --> 00:27:45,228
Mother,

577
00:27:45,749 --> 00:27:47,109
yesterday, on my way back,

578
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,960
I came across a woman
who had lost her money.

579
00:27:48,989 --> 00:27:50,188
She couldn't afford her lodging

580
00:27:50,228 --> 00:27:52,349
and was nearly taken to the authorities
by the innkeeper.

581
00:27:52,388 --> 00:27:53,908
So, I helped her out.

582
00:27:54,708 --> 00:27:55,989
Perhaps she's here

583
00:27:56,349 --> 00:27:57,549
to find me.

584
00:27:59,069 --> 00:28:01,589
What a reliable and honorable person.

585
00:28:01,749 --> 00:28:03,908
Quick, bring her in.

586
00:28:04,069 --> 00:28:04,868
Yes.

587
00:28:12,069 --> 00:28:12,989
Greetings, Mr. Luo.

588
00:28:13,668 --> 00:28:14,428
Miss Yang.

589
00:28:15,388 --> 00:28:16,708
Please greet my mother.

590
00:28:20,868 --> 00:28:22,029
Greetings, Old Madam Luo.

591
00:28:22,509 --> 00:28:24,309
I'm deeply grateful to Mr. Luo

592
00:28:24,549 --> 00:28:25,868
for his help.

593
00:28:26,188 --> 00:28:28,549
Today, I've come to repay the debt
and express my gratitude.

594
00:28:28,812 --> 00:28:30,971
Please, stand up.

595
00:28:31,188 --> 00:28:32,228
Thank you, Old Madam Luo.

596
00:28:37,945 --> 00:28:40,745
Come closer, let me take a look.

597
00:28:53,228 --> 00:28:53,989
Such resemblance...

598
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,919
Such uncanny resemblance.

599
00:29:00,148 --> 00:29:02,868
Young Lady, where are you from?

600
00:29:03,549 --> 00:29:05,789
Why did you come to the capital alone?

601
00:29:05,948 --> 00:29:06,948
Old Madam Luo,

602
00:29:07,228 --> 00:29:08,749
I'm from the north.

603
00:29:08,948 --> 00:29:09,989
My family originally

604
00:29:10,109 --> 00:29:11,549
ran a medicine shop.

605
00:29:11,868 --> 00:29:13,589
But after my parents passed away,

606
00:29:14,388 --> 00:29:15,789
the north became chaotic.

607
00:29:15,948 --> 00:29:17,349
After discussing with my elder brother,

608
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,509
we decided to move to the capital.

609
00:29:19,829 --> 00:29:21,668
Unfortunately, we encountered bandits
on the way,

610
00:29:22,069 --> 00:29:23,749
and I got separated from my brother.

611
00:29:23,989 --> 00:29:25,109
After escaping,

612
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:26,989
I came here alone

613
00:29:27,228 --> 00:29:28,868
to search for my brother.

614
00:29:29,589 --> 00:29:31,908
Unfortunately, the little money
I had left

615
00:29:32,109 --> 00:29:33,388
was stolen.

616
00:29:33,789 --> 00:29:34,549
Miss Yang,

617
00:29:35,349 --> 00:29:36,948
if you're penniless,

618
00:29:37,069 --> 00:29:38,708
how did you manage to repay me?

619
00:29:38,908 --> 00:29:41,428
I pawned the gold hairpin
my mother left me.

620
00:29:41,868 --> 00:29:44,309
I must repay your kindness.

621
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,280
What a pitiful situation
this young lady is in.

622
00:29:49,509 --> 00:29:51,148
As someone who's faced hardships,

623
00:29:51,428 --> 00:29:53,749
we should help her
find her brother soon,

624
00:29:53,948 --> 00:29:56,708
so they can reunite as family.

625
00:29:57,388 --> 00:29:58,708
How about this?

626
00:29:58,868 --> 00:30:01,868
Let's allow her to stay here for now.

627
00:30:02,388 --> 00:30:04,948
It's too dangerous for a girl like her

628
00:30:05,388 --> 00:30:07,628
to wander outside.

629
00:30:08,908 --> 00:30:10,468
Mother, you're absolutely right.

630
00:30:10,789 --> 00:30:11,829
Young Lady,

631
00:30:11,908 --> 00:30:13,349
you can stay here for now.

632
00:30:13,628 --> 00:30:15,069
Once we find your brother,

633
00:30:15,269 --> 00:30:17,309
we'll arrange for you to be reunited.

634
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:19,388
I...

635
00:30:20,549 --> 00:30:21,708
Is this a good idea?

636
00:30:22,188 --> 00:30:22,948
Young Lady,

637
00:30:23,148 --> 00:30:24,549
since my grandma suggested it,

638
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,919
why don't you stay?

639
00:30:26,868 --> 00:30:28,069
Thank you, Old Madam Luo.

640
00:30:29,708 --> 00:30:31,349
I'm skilled in embroidery.

641
00:30:31,549 --> 00:30:32,989
If you don't mind,

642
00:30:33,349 --> 00:30:35,749
I can do needlework for the household.

643
00:30:35,749 --> 00:30:37,589
That won't be necessary.

644
00:30:37,628 --> 00:30:38,908
You're our guest.

645
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,759
You don't need to work here.

646
00:30:40,767 --> 00:30:42,968
Madam Chen, please make arrangements.

647
00:30:42,975 --> 00:30:44,255
Yes, Mother.

648
00:30:45,468 --> 00:30:46,309
Ms. Zhao,

649
00:30:47,069 --> 00:30:49,708
take the young lady to rest.

650
00:30:49,749 --> 00:30:50,509
Yes.

651
00:30:51,789 --> 00:30:52,668
This way, Young Lady.

652
00:30:54,589 --> 00:30:55,708
Excuse me.

653
00:31:05,428 --> 00:31:07,029
If you need anything, just let us know.

654
00:31:07,509 --> 00:31:08,749
The Old Madam has instructed us

655
00:31:08,868 --> 00:31:10,188
to treat you well.

656
00:31:10,349 --> 00:31:12,668
We wouldn't want anyone
to think we're neglecting you.

657
00:31:14,309 --> 00:31:15,468
Thank you, Ms. Zhao.

658
00:31:16,069 --> 00:31:17,708
If I make any mistakes,

659
00:31:17,868 --> 00:31:19,029
please be patient with me.

660
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,639
Young Master, what are you looking at?

661
00:31:36,749 --> 00:31:38,029
Who is that young woman?

662
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,560
I don't know. She looks unfamiliar.

663
00:31:40,614 --> 00:31:42,614
Perhaps she's a new servant.

664
00:31:46,109 --> 00:31:46,868
Young Master,

665
00:31:47,188 --> 00:31:49,789
- have you taken a liking to her?
- Nonsense.

666
00:31:51,468 --> 00:31:53,269
She looks kind of familiar, that's all.

667
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:55,840
Let's go.

668
00:31:58,628 --> 00:32:00,708
That Miss Yang

669
00:32:01,069 --> 00:32:02,829
really resembles Mother.

670
00:32:03,069 --> 00:32:04,509
Did First Master save her

671
00:32:04,549 --> 00:32:06,989
because she looks like Madam Gu,

672
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,760
and he felt sympathy for her?

673
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:15,320
Young Lady,

674
00:32:15,428 --> 00:32:17,029
the workers from the shop
sent a message.

675
00:32:17,069 --> 00:32:19,139
There were some issues
during the repairs,

676
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,680
and they needed
the owner to check it out.

677
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:22,340
I wanted to consult with Sixth Master Lin,

678
00:32:22,388 --> 00:32:24,628
but Madam Lin has been
watching him closely.

679
00:32:24,628 --> 00:32:25,749
So I had no choice

680
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,961
but to return.

681
00:32:27,188 --> 00:32:27,948
That's right.

682
00:32:28,549 --> 00:32:30,789
Sixth Uncle is busy studying

683
00:32:31,109 --> 00:32:32,228
under Mother's watchful eyes.

684
00:32:32,349 --> 00:32:34,589
He probably doesn't have time
for the shop.

685
00:32:35,509 --> 00:32:36,749
I'll go and take a look myself.

686
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,378
(Liuhe Tavern)

687
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:50,240
The sun sets, casting a pale light.

688
00:32:50,509 --> 00:32:56,188
Across the sea, the white waves merge.

689
00:32:58,549 --> 00:32:59,309
Merge.

690
00:33:00,109 --> 00:33:05,789
Merged by planks, they flow in.

691
00:33:06,309 --> 00:33:07,388
In.

692
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,360
Qi An, your turn.

693
00:33:10,868 --> 00:33:11,868
I wasn't part of this.

694
00:33:11,908 --> 00:33:13,428
How could I compete with you guys?

695
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:15,148
You haven't changed

696
00:33:15,188 --> 00:33:16,908
after all these years, Xia Yong.

697
00:33:17,228 --> 00:33:18,829
You always back out
when you can't keep up.

698
00:33:19,509 --> 00:33:20,219
I'm not backing out.

699
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:21,340
His response wasn't matched.

700
00:33:21,344 --> 00:33:22,420
- Qi An is right.
- Right?

701
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:24,096
- If you can't, drink three cups.
- Yeah.

702
00:33:24,148 --> 00:33:24,939
Don't act shamelessly!

703
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:25,872
- Three drinks.
- Yeah.

704
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,679
In Fool's Valley,

705
00:33:28,148 --> 00:33:29,948
why worry about right or wrong?

706
00:33:30,428 --> 00:33:31,188
Shenyuan,

707
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:32,829
that's a good response.

708
00:33:32,948 --> 00:33:35,148
But you're late, so you need to drink.

709
00:33:38,069 --> 00:33:39,269
A toast to our teacher.

710
00:33:46,868 --> 00:33:47,908
Brothers, please sit.

711
00:33:48,228 --> 00:33:49,708
I'll drink three cups as my penalty.

712
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:04,109
Shenyuan, that's enough.

713
00:34:04,509 --> 00:34:05,589
The exams are approaching.

714
00:34:05,628 --> 00:34:07,148
It's understandable

715
00:34:07,188 --> 00:34:08,869
that you're a bit late due to studying.

716
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:12,469
Alright, if you say so.

717
00:34:14,708 --> 00:34:16,109
Among us brothers,

718
00:34:16,509 --> 00:34:17,389
Shenyuan is the best

719
00:34:17,949 --> 00:34:19,389
when it comes to studying.

720
00:34:19,509 --> 00:34:21,869
He'll surely outshine us in the exams.

721
00:34:21,869 --> 00:34:23,549
I remember that Senior Daoyan

722
00:34:23,748 --> 00:34:25,228
was a top scorer in all three rounds.

723
00:34:25,668 --> 00:34:26,429
Shenyuan,

724
00:34:26,869 --> 00:34:28,748
how do you plan to surpass
Senior Daoyan?

725
00:34:28,788 --> 00:34:31,268
How could I possibly
match his knowledge?

726
00:34:32,748 --> 00:34:33,828
Back in my day,

727
00:34:33,828 --> 00:34:35,708
I was a top scorer in two rounds.

728
00:34:35,869 --> 00:34:37,869
How could that be?

729
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:40,308
I remember you placed second
in the palace exams

730
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,320
and cried for a month.

731
00:34:41,748 --> 00:34:43,708
- Really?
- The one who cried for a month

732
00:34:43,708 --> 00:34:45,788
wasn't me, it was Junior Fang.

733
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:47,708
It says so in the exam certificate.

734
00:34:51,949 --> 00:34:52,989
Do you all remember?

735
00:34:54,069 --> 00:34:56,148
Our teacher used to put
our exam certificates

736
00:34:57,148 --> 00:34:58,228
up on the wall.

737
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:00,188
I remember.

738
00:35:01,268 --> 00:35:02,509
He said that wall

739
00:35:03,109 --> 00:35:04,549
was his life's accomplishment.

740
00:35:05,904 --> 00:35:07,460
Today is our teacher's
death anniversary.

741
00:35:08,748 --> 00:35:10,308
When he was alive, he always said

742
00:35:11,348 --> 00:35:12,268
that after he passed on,

743
00:35:12,389 --> 00:35:13,828
there was no need to visit his grave.

744
00:35:15,228 --> 00:35:16,228
Every year on this day,

745
00:35:17,069 --> 00:35:18,700
we brothers should gather together,

746
00:35:18,708 --> 00:35:19,989
have a drink, and celebrate.

747
00:35:22,109 --> 00:35:22,869
But now,

748
00:35:24,228 --> 00:35:25,389
all our brothers

749
00:35:25,472 --> 00:35:26,660
are scattered across the land.

750
00:35:27,989 --> 00:35:29,509
Who knows when we'll reunite.

751
00:35:32,228 --> 00:35:33,029
I believe

752
00:35:33,909 --> 00:35:35,188
that day will come.

753
00:35:36,736 --> 00:35:38,080
Shenyuan is about to take the exams.

754
00:35:39,069 --> 00:35:40,509
I believe we'll soon have

755
00:35:40,869 --> 00:35:42,389
an exam certificate

756
00:35:42,429 --> 00:35:44,788
that says "triple top scorer".

757
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,679
Yes,

758
00:35:46,869 --> 00:35:47,949
the past can't be changed,

759
00:35:48,228 --> 00:35:50,228
but the future is still ours to pursue.

760
00:35:54,668 --> 00:35:55,429
Shenyuan,

761
00:35:56,348 --> 00:35:58,228
I know that once you decide
on something,

762
00:35:58,228 --> 00:35:59,389
no one can stop you.

763
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,616
But the path to officialdom
is filled with danger.

764
00:36:03,069 --> 00:36:04,748
You are our hope.

765
00:36:05,228 --> 00:36:06,628
Take care of yourself.

766
00:36:07,708 --> 00:36:08,589
Don't worry, Senior.

767
00:36:09,628 --> 00:36:10,989
I will keep myself safe

768
00:36:13,228 --> 00:36:14,469
and protect my brothers.

769
00:36:17,069 --> 00:36:17,869
Alright,

770
00:36:18,228 --> 00:36:20,308
if our teacher were here,
seeing us like this,

771
00:36:20,308 --> 00:36:21,459
he would surely scold us.

772
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:22,928
Let's listen to our teacher's words

773
00:36:23,109 --> 00:36:26,348
and enjoy ourselves fully today.

774
00:36:26,748 --> 00:36:27,389
Cheers.

775
00:36:27,909 --> 00:36:28,308
Cheers.

776
00:36:37,977 --> 00:36:40,781
(Fengle House)

777
00:36:41,429 --> 00:36:43,469
Your mother's death anniversary
is coming up.

778
00:36:45,069 --> 00:36:47,148
Remember to hold a ceremony
at the temple.

779
00:36:48,589 --> 00:36:49,509
Don't worry, Uncle.

780
00:36:50,628 --> 00:36:53,069
I have already prepared everything.

781
00:36:54,949 --> 00:36:55,668
Good.

782
00:36:57,228 --> 00:36:58,828
It's a shame your mother isn't around

783
00:36:59,628 --> 00:37:01,348
to witness all this

784
00:37:02,869 --> 00:37:04,429
and enjoy a life of luxury.

785
00:37:07,509 --> 00:37:08,509
Uncle, every year

786
00:37:09,909 --> 00:37:11,509
you remember her death anniversary.

787
00:37:12,348 --> 00:37:15,029
Your mother and I were siblings,
after all.

788
00:37:16,828 --> 00:37:18,389
Our mother died young,

789
00:37:19,828 --> 00:37:21,188
and Father didn't care for us.

790
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,561
We

791
00:37:23,429 --> 00:37:24,869
were each other's only support.

792
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,300
My elder sister was like a mother,

793
00:37:27,989 --> 00:37:30,308
and our bond was unlike any other.

794
00:37:33,509 --> 00:37:35,308
Your Lordship, the servants reported

795
00:37:35,469 --> 00:37:36,869
that Seventh Lady went out

796
00:37:37,069 --> 00:37:37,869
somewhere nearby.

797
00:37:42,549 --> 00:37:44,389
That worker is truly heartless.

798
00:37:44,549 --> 00:37:46,029
Turns out he just wanted more money,

799
00:37:46,228 --> 00:37:48,469
making up nonsense about issues
with the building.

800
00:37:49,228 --> 00:37:51,909
Young Lady, why did you agree
to give him more money?

801
00:37:52,788 --> 00:37:54,708
If we had to find someone new
and start over,

802
00:37:54,788 --> 00:37:56,348
it would have taken even longer.

803
00:37:56,989 --> 00:37:59,148
Sixth Uncle is busy now,

804
00:37:59,549 --> 00:38:01,228
and I can't always come out.

805
00:38:02,148 --> 00:38:03,869
This worker may be greedy,

806
00:38:03,989 --> 00:38:06,549
but his work is meticulous.

807
00:38:06,828 --> 00:38:08,109
Nothing can be perfect.

808
00:38:08,389 --> 00:38:10,708
I'm paying for a peace of mind.

809
00:38:13,069 --> 00:38:13,989
Get up.

810
00:38:14,989 --> 00:38:16,708
Whose lovely lady is this?

811
00:38:16,748 --> 00:38:18,668
Let me have a good look at you.

812
00:38:18,688 --> 00:38:19,968
Where did this drunk come from?

813
00:38:20,016 --> 00:38:22,100
Our young lady is not someone
you can harass.

814
00:38:22,389 --> 00:38:24,188
My lord is the son of Duke Xu.

815
00:38:24,228 --> 00:38:26,029
You should watch your words,
little girl.

816
00:38:26,308 --> 00:38:27,308
Get away from us.

817
00:38:28,308 --> 00:38:30,029
Not only a lovely lady,

818
00:38:30,069 --> 00:38:32,348
but a feisty one too. Excellent.

819
00:38:32,389 --> 00:38:34,509
I'm warning you, don't come any closer.

820
00:38:34,828 --> 00:38:36,748
If you do, I won't hold back.

821
00:38:36,788 --> 00:38:39,348
Let's see what you've got.

822
00:38:39,348 --> 00:38:39,788
You...

823
00:38:40,549 --> 00:38:41,348
Get lost.

824
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,400
Young Master Xu...

825
00:38:44,509 --> 00:38:44,909
Help me!

826
00:38:48,148 --> 00:38:50,069
Help...

827
00:38:50,304 --> 00:38:52,160
- Let's go.
- Young Master, over here.

828
00:38:55,909 --> 00:38:56,989
Greetings, Marquis Lu.

829
00:38:58,188 --> 00:38:58,989
Young Master Xu,

830
00:38:59,228 --> 00:39:01,429
abducting women in broad daylight?

831
00:39:01,708 --> 00:39:03,748
I wonder if Duke Xu knows about this.

832
00:39:04,188 --> 00:39:05,549
I'm innocent.

833
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:06,729
This young lady

834
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:08,220
pushed me into the river for no reason.

835
00:39:08,228 --> 00:39:09,668
I was just about to question her.

836
00:39:09,909 --> 00:39:10,949
From what I see,

837
00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:13,308
it was you who started this,

838
00:39:13,348 --> 00:39:14,748
Young Master Xu.

839
00:39:16,708 --> 00:39:17,469
Marquis Lu,

840
00:39:17,869 --> 00:39:18,668
I...

841
00:39:18,828 --> 00:39:20,949
I was drunk and acted foolishly.

842
00:39:21,148 --> 00:39:22,469
I've offended this young lady.

843
00:39:22,549 --> 00:39:23,748
I will apologize

844
00:39:24,069 --> 00:39:25,708
to her now.

845
00:39:26,828 --> 00:39:27,469
Sorry.

846
00:39:28,148 --> 00:39:29,348
Come on.

847
00:39:33,708 --> 00:39:34,509
Seventh Lady.

848
00:39:37,748 --> 00:39:38,989
Is this how you

849
00:39:39,148 --> 00:39:40,509
thank your savior?

850
00:39:43,869 --> 00:39:45,748
Thank you for saving my life,
Marquis Lu.

851
00:39:46,224 --> 00:39:47,728
I have nothing to repay you with,

852
00:39:47,748 --> 00:39:49,109
but I will always remember this.

853
00:39:49,708 --> 00:39:52,109
I'm sure you have many matters
to attend to,

854
00:39:52,148 --> 00:39:53,389
so I'll take my leave.

855
00:39:53,788 --> 00:39:54,549
I'm not busy.

856
00:39:55,628 --> 00:39:56,389
How about

857
00:39:58,069 --> 00:39:59,469
a game of chess?

858
00:39:59,828 --> 00:40:00,869
I don't know how to play.

859
00:40:02,148 --> 00:40:03,429
I can teach you.

860
00:40:26,589 --> 00:40:27,389
At the Literary Feast,

861
00:40:27,828 --> 00:40:29,348
the Luo family made a big impression,

862
00:40:29,389 --> 00:40:31,029
and Chen Daoyan got out safely.

863
00:40:31,909 --> 00:40:32,668
You

864
00:40:35,268 --> 00:40:36,348
played your part well.

865
00:40:39,869 --> 00:40:41,909
I have no idea what you're saying.

866
00:40:43,308 --> 00:40:44,949
I'm just a girl.

867
00:40:45,708 --> 00:40:47,509
I don't understand a marquis' affairs.

868
00:40:47,949 --> 00:40:50,429
You overestimate me.

869
00:40:53,668 --> 00:40:54,589
You don't understand?

870
00:40:57,069 --> 00:40:57,869
No.

871
00:41:04,909 --> 00:41:05,989
I've lost.

872
00:41:06,348 --> 00:41:08,389
You're indeed a master at chess.

873
00:41:09,308 --> 00:41:11,348
But you just said you don't know
how to play.

874
00:41:12,228 --> 00:41:13,748
It seems what you say

875
00:41:14,109 --> 00:41:15,228
isn't always true.

876
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:19,509
I wouldn't dare lie to you.

877
00:41:20,348 --> 00:41:21,989
It's only because you taught me well.

878
00:41:23,069 --> 00:41:24,389
It's getting late,

879
00:41:24,549 --> 00:41:25,708
and the game is over.

880
00:41:25,909 --> 00:41:27,509
I should return to my house.

881
00:41:27,708 --> 00:41:29,188
What if I don't let you go?

882
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,272
Do you think you can make it back
to the Luo Residence?

883
00:41:34,549 --> 00:41:35,989
Surely someone of your status

884
00:41:36,549 --> 00:41:37,869
wouldn't bicker with me.

885
00:41:38,949 --> 00:41:40,069
Otherwise,

886
00:41:40,509 --> 00:41:42,029
you'd be no different from that man

887
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,660
who fell into the pond earlier.

888
00:41:44,228 --> 00:41:45,628
So quick-witted.

889
00:41:46,628 --> 00:41:47,389
How about this?

890
00:41:48,268 --> 00:41:50,869
Shall we make a wager?

891
00:41:51,788 --> 00:41:52,549
I don't want to bet.

892
00:41:53,708 --> 00:41:56,188
Then you'll just have to wait
for your Third Brother to save you.

893
00:41:56,912 --> 00:41:58,340
You're clearly skilled at gambling.

894
00:41:58,589 --> 00:42:00,268
Is it necessary to bully me?

895
00:42:07,188 --> 00:42:08,308
It seems

896
00:42:09,708 --> 00:42:11,188
you know me quite well.

897
00:42:14,869 --> 00:42:15,429
Reveal.

898
00:42:23,708 --> 00:42:24,788
I quit.

899
00:42:24,788 --> 00:42:26,109
You must be cheating.

900
00:42:26,188 --> 00:42:28,148
How could I cheat when I can't even see?

901
00:42:28,989 --> 00:42:31,029
How is it possible to get it right
every time?

902
00:42:31,348 --> 00:42:32,148
I told you,

903
00:42:32,509 --> 00:42:34,029
I was a natural-born gambler.

904
00:42:34,348 --> 00:42:36,148
If you refuse to believe me,
what can I say?

905
00:42:36,869 --> 00:42:38,348
One time, when I was imprisoned,

906
00:42:38,509 --> 00:42:39,989
I pretended to be a compulsive gambler

907
00:42:40,628 --> 00:42:43,429
to make a certain someone think
I had lost my resolve,

908
00:42:43,828 --> 00:42:45,628
and lower her guard.

909
00:42:45,708 --> 00:42:47,509
But in truth, I don't like gambling,

910
00:42:47,589 --> 00:42:48,628
nor am I any good at it.

911
00:42:49,589 --> 00:42:50,788
Only that one person

912
00:42:51,358 --> 00:42:53,197
would always lose when playing dice
with me,

913
00:42:54,869 --> 00:42:56,668
and she thought I was a gambling genius.
