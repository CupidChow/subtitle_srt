00:01:43,736 --> 00:01:45,220
(Duke Ying's Residence)

5
00:01:46,775 --> 00:01:47,575
Third Brother.

6
00:01:49,176 --> 00:01:50,256
What are you doing here?

7
00:01:50,816 --> 00:01:52,096
I'm waiting for you.

8
00:01:52,616 --> 00:01:54,695
You must be waiting for me here

9
00:01:54,695 --> 00:01:55,849
because of the marriage today.

10
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:57,010
My father told me this morning

11
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:58,620
that we have been engaged
since long ago.

12
00:01:58,624 --> 00:02:00,250
You must have taught him this, right?

13
00:02:01,055 --> 00:02:02,415
Duke Ying's words

14
00:02:02,415 --> 00:02:03,536
are indeed taught by me.

15
00:02:03,896 --> 00:02:06,096
I would like to first present
the engagement letter.

16
00:02:06,695 --> 00:02:08,895
When I have passed the test,

17
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:11,330
I will formally come
to propose marriage to Yining.

18
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:14,895
However, if someone

19
00:02:15,376 --> 00:02:17,216
mentions my relationship with her,

20
00:02:17,295 --> 00:02:18,615
for her reputation,

21
00:02:18,695 --> 00:02:19,895
I wish that you

22
00:02:20,295 --> 00:02:21,855
consider my statement.

23
00:02:23,895 --> 00:02:25,256
Your statement?

24
00:02:27,175 --> 00:02:27,976
What is it?

25
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:29,855
When Yining

26
00:02:29,855 --> 00:02:31,256
was fostered in Luo's Residence,

27
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:33,216
my grandma had

28
00:02:33,216 --> 00:02:34,256
promised my marriage to her

29
00:02:34,976 --> 00:02:36,096
but she was still very young

30
00:02:36,295 --> 00:02:38,256
so it was never brought up
all this while.

31
00:02:56,895 --> 00:02:59,816
You are quite thoughtful.

32
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:01,855
Since this is related to Yining,

33
00:03:02,776 --> 00:03:03,976
it is good for me

34
00:03:04,544 --> 00:03:05,810
to put more thought into it.

35
00:03:05,888 --> 00:03:07,120
However, I did not request him

36
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,210
to deceive His Majesty.

37
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:09,792
I was doing it

38
00:03:09,808 --> 00:03:11,410
for you to avoid criticism
in the future.

39
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:12,400
Have you ever thought

40
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,159
that if His Majesty

41
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,290
charges my father with
the crime of deceiving the emperor,

42
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:16,135
what should we do?

43
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,704
I have already reported this

44
00:03:18,752 --> 00:03:19,890
to my grandma.

45
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,952
I have also explained this
to the family as well.

46
00:03:21,952 --> 00:03:23,232
No one will reveal this.

47
00:03:23,455 --> 00:03:24,496
Even if Lu Jiaxue

48
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:25,575
reported this to His Majesty,

49
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:28,208
it wouldn't result in Duke Ying
being charged with a crime.

50
00:03:34,976 --> 00:03:36,216
Rest assured.

51
00:03:44,855 --> 00:03:45,656
Father.

52
00:03:46,096 --> 00:03:46,855
You.

53
00:03:55,895 --> 00:03:56,816
Shenyuan.

54
00:03:58,015 --> 00:03:59,216
There is one thing

55
00:03:59,295 --> 00:04:00,855
that I haven't been able to figure out.

56
00:04:01,615 --> 00:04:03,056
About Lu Jiaxue

57
00:04:03,175 --> 00:04:04,336
reporting on Wang Yuan,

58
00:04:04,336 --> 00:04:05,496
there are full of loopholes

59
00:04:05,496 --> 00:04:06,695
so why was His Majesty

60
00:04:06,695 --> 00:04:08,496
deceived by him?

61
00:04:08,776 --> 00:04:09,816
I figure His Majesty

62
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:12,015
doesn't completely trust Lu Jiaxue.

63
00:04:13,056 --> 00:04:14,295
The incident with Wang Yuan

64
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:15,809
involves a wide range of officials,

65
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:17,530
and the entire court and government
are in turmoil.

66
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,170
Lu Jiaxue reported Wang Yuan
at this time

67
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:21,216
and handed over the proceeds
to the national treasury

68
00:04:21,495 --> 00:04:22,656
which in His Majesty's eyes,

69
00:04:23,016 --> 00:04:24,656
has alleviated an urgent need.

70
00:04:27,255 --> 00:04:28,855
I thought so, too.

71
00:04:29,415 --> 00:04:30,216
Therefore,

72
00:04:30,415 --> 00:04:32,295
he figured out His Majesty's mind

73
00:04:32,576 --> 00:04:34,536
so he dared to make such a bold move.

74
00:04:34,815 --> 00:04:35,896
I believe

75
00:04:36,815 --> 00:04:38,656
that he has no moves left.

76
00:04:39,096 --> 00:04:39,855
Although this step

77
00:04:40,175 --> 00:04:41,096
protected him

78
00:04:41,096 --> 00:04:42,336
for the time being,

79
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:43,815
it also increased

80
00:04:43,815 --> 00:04:45,656
His Majesty's suspicion of him.

81
00:04:47,576 --> 00:04:48,415
Luo Shenyuan,

82
00:04:49,216 --> 00:04:50,896
you have to be grateful for this case.

83
00:04:51,495 --> 00:04:53,255
If it weren't for it,

84
00:04:53,495 --> 00:04:55,336
you wouldn't be able to
marry Yining so soon.

85
00:04:56,615 --> 00:04:57,656
Let alone a month,

86
00:04:57,855 --> 00:04:59,456
even a year would be difficult.

87
00:04:59,495 --> 00:05:01,016
You are absolutely right.

88
00:05:01,495 --> 00:05:02,649
I will definitely

89
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:04,352
consider Yining's future more
from now on.

90
00:05:07,456 --> 00:05:09,096
I came to visit again today

91
00:05:09,536 --> 00:05:10,615
to formally propose marriage

92
00:05:10,656 --> 00:05:12,096
to Yining to the Duke.

93
00:05:14,336 --> 00:05:15,375
Is this necessary?

94
00:05:17,456 --> 00:05:19,735
Everyone knows

95
00:05:19,735 --> 00:05:21,375
that you and Yining are engaged now.

96
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,600
She will definitely marry you,
it's just a matter of time.

97
00:05:23,696 --> 00:05:24,730
Why be in such a hurry?

98
00:05:25,096 --> 00:05:26,175
Rules cannot be abolished.

99
00:05:27,456 --> 00:05:30,175
You didn't agree last time,

100
00:05:30,976 --> 00:05:34,415
so I sincerely ask for
your permission again today.

101
00:05:36,576 --> 00:05:37,375
Good,

102
00:05:37,776 --> 00:05:39,415
you know the etiquette.

103
00:05:39,935 --> 00:05:40,776
You can ask

104
00:05:40,976 --> 00:05:43,696
your parents to come
to propose a marriage tomorrow.

105
00:05:45,055 --> 00:05:47,375
Thank you, Duke Ying.

106
00:05:55,776 --> 00:05:57,375
I tried so hard,

107
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,016
but in the end, I was just helping him
for his wedding.

108
00:06:00,096 --> 00:06:01,255
This is a done deal.

109
00:06:01,255 --> 00:06:02,536
Let's just let it go.

110
00:06:06,656 --> 00:06:07,776
Done deal?

111
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,090
Back then, my military merits
were taken,

112
00:06:10,295 --> 00:06:11,935
and I was nearly framed and crippled.

113
00:06:12,096 --> 00:06:13,536
If I had accepted my fate,

114
00:06:13,855 --> 00:06:15,536
I wonder where I would be buried by now,

115
00:06:15,735 --> 00:06:16,609
how could there

116
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:18,176
be the current
Marquis Anbei's Residence?

117
00:06:19,696 --> 00:06:20,976
The me today

118
00:06:21,976 --> 00:06:23,576
is no longer the Lu Jiaxue back then.

119
00:06:26,576 --> 00:06:27,735
I will not accept fate.

120
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,170
However, there is not much room
for a turnaround.

121
00:06:30,175 --> 00:06:30,935
We...

122
00:06:36,815 --> 00:06:37,615
Not much room

123
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,010
does not mean there is no possibility.

124
00:06:40,656 --> 00:06:42,375
Has anything I did

125
00:06:43,576 --> 00:06:45,096
and got

126
00:06:45,935 --> 00:06:47,136
ever been easy?

127
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:58,368
When Luo Shenyuan marries Yining

128
00:06:59,456 --> 00:07:01,536
in a month,

129
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:07,216
I will not let him have his way.

130
00:07:14,055 --> 00:07:14,576
Alright.

131
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:16,495
Place all the jewelry in the boxes.

132
00:07:16,495 --> 00:07:17,976
Be careful not to bump into anything.

133
00:07:18,255 --> 00:07:19,495
Be more alert,

134
00:07:19,495 --> 00:07:20,776
and we can't make any mistakes,

135
00:07:20,776 --> 00:07:21,615
understand?

136
00:07:22,136 --> 00:07:22,656
Madam,

137
00:07:22,656 --> 00:07:23,815
you should take a rest.

138
00:07:23,855 --> 00:07:25,456
You've been busy all morning.

139
00:07:25,456 --> 00:07:26,255
I'm not tired.

140
00:07:26,536 --> 00:07:27,735
Shenyuan and Yining's wedding

141
00:07:27,735 --> 00:07:28,649
is set for next month.

142
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,032
We have to make the most of our time

143
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,632
and give Yining everything she deserves.

144
00:07:31,896 --> 00:07:32,696
Yes, Madam.

145
00:07:36,735 --> 00:07:37,576
Mother.

146
00:07:37,896 --> 00:07:38,696
Old Madam.

147
00:07:39,776 --> 00:07:40,369
Old Madam.

148
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:42,208
No need for formalities,
carry on with your work.

149
00:07:42,256 --> 00:07:42,864
Take a look.

150
00:07:43,495 --> 00:07:44,375
Hairu,

151
00:07:44,736 --> 00:07:47,370
are you moving all the family's
belongings out here?

152
00:07:47,576 --> 00:07:48,855
Shenyuan is marrying Yining,

153
00:07:48,855 --> 00:07:49,576
and Yining sees me

154
00:07:49,576 --> 00:07:50,776
as her mother for so many years.

155
00:07:50,776 --> 00:07:52,055
I'm so happy these days

156
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:53,136
that I can't even sleep.

157
00:07:53,536 --> 00:07:54,855
We must prepare more betrothal gifts

158
00:07:54,855 --> 00:07:56,136
for Yining.

159
00:07:56,136 --> 00:07:56,696
Yes.

160
00:07:56,696 --> 00:07:57,415
When Old Madam heard

161
00:07:57,415 --> 00:07:58,976
that Young Lady Yining was coming back,

162
00:07:58,976 --> 00:08:00,735
she was so joyous.

163
00:08:01,136 --> 00:08:03,136
Ever since Yining moved
to Duke Ying's Residence,

164
00:08:03,295 --> 00:08:05,615
Old Madam has been
thinking about her day and night.

165
00:08:05,855 --> 00:08:07,136
It is great

166
00:08:07,424 --> 00:08:08,890
that Young Lady Yining is returning.

167
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:10,760
She will be able to stay in
Luo's Residence every day

168
00:08:10,768 --> 00:08:12,592
and stay by Old Madam's side
all the time.

169
00:08:12,696 --> 00:08:13,615
Hairu,

170
00:08:13,855 --> 00:08:14,935
you just

171
00:08:14,935 --> 00:08:16,576
completed Yixiu's wedding arrangements

172
00:08:16,576 --> 00:08:18,136
and you have to prepare

173
00:08:18,136 --> 00:08:19,735
for Shenyuan's wedding with Yining now.

174
00:08:20,495 --> 00:08:21,735
Appreciate your hard work.

175
00:08:21,896 --> 00:08:23,696
Mother, it's not hard work for me,

176
00:08:23,776 --> 00:08:25,375
I'm just too happy.

177
00:08:27,111 --> 00:08:30,095
(Dowry List)

178
00:08:33,135 --> 00:08:33,976
That's it?

179
00:08:34,735 --> 00:08:35,576
That's everything?

180
00:08:36,176 --> 00:08:37,615
This was prepared in accordance

181
00:08:37,615 --> 00:08:39,135
with Duke Xu's daughter's dowry list.

182
00:08:39,135 --> 00:08:41,336
Just the clothing and jewelry
will fit five carts.

183
00:08:42,015 --> 00:08:42,816
Let me ask you this,

184
00:08:43,495 --> 00:08:44,576
how many daughters

185
00:08:44,576 --> 00:08:45,895
does Duke Xu's Residence have?

186
00:08:46,895 --> 00:08:47,696
Seven!

187
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:49,209
Yining is the only daughter

188
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:50,224
in Duke Ying's Residence.

189
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,050
Listen,

190
00:08:51,056 --> 00:08:52,135
prepare twice as much

191
00:08:52,135 --> 00:08:53,216
of this dowry list.

192
00:08:53,296 --> 00:08:54,096
Besides,

193
00:08:54,496 --> 00:08:56,170
give the few estates
in the eastern suburbs

194
00:08:56,255 --> 00:08:57,135
to her, too.

195
00:08:57,312 --> 00:08:58,624
If we talk about common practices,

196
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,816
we have to wait for
Luo family's betrothal gift to arrive

197
00:09:00,832 --> 00:09:03,190
before we prepare the dowry
according to betrothal gifts' value.

198
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,970
Should we wait a little longer?

199
00:09:05,135 --> 00:09:06,096
What common practice?

200
00:09:06,775 --> 00:09:08,969
Wei family doesn't follow customs.

201
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:10,608
No matter how much
is the betrothal gift,

202
00:09:10,608 --> 00:09:11,792
we're giving this much as dowry.

203
00:09:11,855 --> 00:09:12,735
This is final.

204
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:15,375
Listen to the Duke.

205
00:09:15,495 --> 00:09:16,855
Prepare more for dowry.

206
00:09:16,855 --> 00:09:17,255
Old Madam.

207
00:09:17,255 --> 00:09:18,375
It's not much.

208
00:09:19,015 --> 00:09:19,816
Yes, Old Madam.

209
00:09:20,456 --> 00:09:22,375
Why are you still here? Go now.

210
00:09:22,576 --> 00:09:23,375
Yes, Duke Ying.

211
00:09:25,255 --> 00:09:27,416
By the way, I have another two sets

212
00:09:27,456 --> 00:09:29,375
of hair ornaments made
of jadeite and gold.

213
00:09:29,696 --> 00:09:31,216
They were all rewarded by the palace.

214
00:09:31,535 --> 00:09:33,135
Add these to Yining.

215
00:09:33,135 --> 00:09:35,015
Then I thank you on behalf of Yining.

216
00:09:35,135 --> 00:09:35,855
I have also

217
00:09:35,855 --> 00:09:37,336
prepared some more gifts for her.

218
00:09:37,336 --> 00:09:39,096
I'll add them to the gifts later.

219
00:09:39,615 --> 00:09:40,416
Mingzhu,

220
00:09:40,735 --> 00:09:42,255
when the Imperial Guards

221
00:09:42,255 --> 00:09:43,696
threatened with swords,

222
00:09:43,895 --> 00:09:45,936
you and Yining were unified

223
00:09:46,096 --> 00:09:47,476
to protect our house.

224
00:09:47,895 --> 00:09:48,696
Don't worry,

225
00:09:48,855 --> 00:09:50,135
your wedding's dowry

226
00:09:50,255 --> 00:09:52,096
will be even more.

227
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:53,375
Thank you, Father,

228
00:09:53,855 --> 00:09:55,576
but I won't get married.

229
00:09:55,576 --> 00:09:57,775
I want to stay by Grandma's side.

230
00:10:01,096 --> 00:10:02,336
Good.

231
00:10:08,816 --> 00:10:09,416
Shao'an.

232
00:10:10,495 --> 00:10:11,296
What are you reading?

233
00:10:11,936 --> 00:10:12,775
Young Master,

234
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,512
it's Young Lady Yinng's

235
00:10:14,528 --> 00:10:16,048
dowry list from Duke Ying's residence.

236
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:18,015
This is only part of it.

237
00:10:18,296 --> 00:10:19,535
I heard that Duke Ying

238
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:20,655
bought all the best jewelry

239
00:10:20,655 --> 00:10:21,655
in town.

240
00:10:21,655 --> 00:10:22,576
Besides, there are also

241
00:10:22,696 --> 00:10:24,216
houses, farms, and banknotes.

242
00:10:24,375 --> 00:10:26,535
Altogether, it's estimated
to be this amount.

243
00:10:27,576 --> 00:10:29,375
Duke Ying's Residence is fond of Yining,

244
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:30,544
so this is not surprising.

245
00:10:30,936 --> 00:10:32,936
Young Master, do you know

246
00:10:32,936 --> 00:10:33,936
that generally speaking,

247
00:10:34,135 --> 00:10:35,976
betrothal gifts should be
double the dowry?

248
00:10:35,976 --> 00:10:36,775
Yes.

249
00:10:39,576 --> 00:10:40,495
Hold that end.

250
00:10:41,296 --> 00:10:42,096
Pull back.

251
00:10:48,096 --> 00:10:48,895
Young Master,

252
00:10:49,056 --> 00:10:49,696
are these

253
00:10:49,696 --> 00:10:50,936
all of your assets?

254
00:10:50,976 --> 00:10:52,135
These are what I prepared.

255
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:53,135
I have not added

256
00:10:53,135 --> 00:10:54,176
in those from Mother yet.

257
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:55,176
Shao'an,

258
00:10:55,568 --> 00:10:56,960
do you think this is enough?

259
00:10:58,176 --> 00:10:58,976
Yes.

260
00:10:59,456 --> 00:11:00,936
This has to be enough, Young Master.

261
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:14,375
It took just a year

262
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:16,135
to recover the capital.

263
00:11:16,255 --> 00:11:17,296
It won't take long

264
00:11:17,296 --> 00:11:18,576
to open another branch.

265
00:11:19,264 --> 00:11:20,496
Congratulations, Young Lady.

266
00:11:23,056 --> 00:11:25,129
About the opening of a new branch,

267
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:26,560
I'll have to discuss with Sixth Sister

268
00:11:26,608 --> 00:11:27,690
and Sixth Uncle.

269
00:11:27,775 --> 00:11:28,576
I wonder

270
00:11:28,576 --> 00:11:30,096
when will they come back.

271
00:11:30,135 --> 00:11:31,775
I heard they were on the way now.

272
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:33,135
They will definitely arrive before

273
00:11:33,135 --> 00:11:34,535
your wedding.

274
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:36,936
Do you really want to marry him?

275
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:47,655
What are you doing here again?

276
00:11:53,056 --> 00:11:54,495
Whether you admit it or not,

277
00:11:55,216 --> 00:11:55,816
I

278
00:11:56,456 --> 00:11:58,056
am the person you should marry.

279
00:11:58,535 --> 00:11:59,375
However,

280
00:11:59,895 --> 00:12:01,216
you are marrying someone else now.

281
00:12:01,936 --> 00:12:03,375
I have no engagement with you,

282
00:12:03,655 --> 00:12:04,895
so why do you opine that?

283
00:12:04,895 --> 00:12:05,849
You are overjoyed

284
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,280
while getting prepared to marry him,

285
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,640
but you're unaware that
you are being plotted against, right?

286
00:12:09,648 --> 00:12:10,370
What I know is you

287
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:11,408
ignored my wishes

288
00:12:11,488 --> 00:12:13,310
and requested His Majesty
to grant a marriage.

289
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:15,096
If it weren't for Third Brother,

290
00:12:15,096 --> 00:12:15,735
perhaps

291
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:17,375
I have already fallen
into deep sorrow now,

292
00:12:17,775 --> 00:12:18,936
just like before.

293
00:12:18,976 --> 00:12:19,970
Luo Shenyuan knew I was

294
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:21,648
going to see His Majesty
to grant a marriage,

295
00:12:21,696 --> 00:12:23,130
so he lied to your father

296
00:12:23,176 --> 00:12:24,936
and talked nonsense
in front of His Majesty.

297
00:12:25,296 --> 00:12:26,816
Aren't you worried about Duke Ying

298
00:12:27,176 --> 00:12:28,775
getting charged
for deceiving the emperor?

299
00:12:28,976 --> 00:12:30,096
Did you come here

300
00:12:30,336 --> 00:12:31,576
and threaten me?

301
00:12:33,056 --> 00:12:34,096
Yining, don't worry.

302
00:12:34,535 --> 00:12:36,176
I, Lu Jiaxue,

303
00:12:36,775 --> 00:12:37,816
will never do anything

304
00:12:38,735 --> 00:12:39,615
that harms you.

305
00:12:40,296 --> 00:12:41,936
If there's nothing else,

306
00:12:42,336 --> 00:12:43,816
I should go back to settle accounts.

307
00:12:44,696 --> 00:12:45,535
I know

308
00:12:46,255 --> 00:12:47,895
that you are marrying Luo Shenyuan

309
00:12:49,135 --> 00:12:50,296
because of the engagement.

310
00:12:50,296 --> 00:12:50,936
Am I right?

311
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:51,936
Either off or on,

312
00:12:51,936 --> 00:12:52,735
I'll still marry him.

313
00:12:52,735 --> 00:12:53,936
Don't marry him!

314
00:12:55,135 --> 00:12:55,936
Yining,

315
00:12:58,096 --> 00:12:58,735
I love you

316
00:12:58,735 --> 00:13:00,096
even before anyone else did.

317
00:13:00,368 --> 00:13:02,112
I have loved you deeply
for the longest time.

318
00:13:02,576 --> 00:13:04,135
Can you give me another chance

319
00:13:04,936 --> 00:13:06,416
so we can start over?

320
00:13:08,535 --> 00:13:09,655
I will treat you well.

321
00:13:09,655 --> 00:13:10,775
Lu Jiaxue, you don't understand

322
00:13:10,775 --> 00:13:12,015
what is it like to love someone.

323
00:13:12,016 --> 00:13:13,170
When we were in the side yard,

324
00:13:13,176 --> 00:13:14,135
it was you who wanted

325
00:13:14,135 --> 00:13:15,296
to be promoted in rank and title

326
00:13:15,296 --> 00:13:16,735
that caused me to be cornered.

327
00:13:16,735 --> 00:13:17,855
Your wish came true,

328
00:13:17,976 --> 00:13:19,375
yet you want to go back to the past.

329
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:21,216
You are doing this for your own sake.

330
00:13:23,855 --> 00:13:25,135
Do you really like him?

331
00:13:25,135 --> 00:13:25,696
I do.

332
00:13:25,696 --> 00:13:27,255
Are you sure it's romance

333
00:13:27,255 --> 00:13:28,375
instead of siblings?

334
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:29,735
I am sure

335
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:30,655
that I'll only love him

336
00:13:30,696 --> 00:13:31,816
for the rest of my life.

337
00:13:39,655 --> 00:13:40,456
Fine.

338
00:13:42,495 --> 00:13:43,296
Fantastic.

339
00:13:46,895 --> 00:13:48,535
But I don't care who you love

340
00:13:48,936 --> 00:13:50,096
and who you want to marry.

341
00:13:51,135 --> 00:13:52,576
You will always be my Mei.

342
00:13:56,176 --> 00:13:57,336
I won't give up.

343
00:13:57,855 --> 00:13:59,056
Anyone against me

344
00:13:59,056 --> 00:14:00,495
will not end well.

345
00:14:16,576 --> 00:14:17,375
Your Lordship,

346
00:14:17,392 --> 00:14:18,610
His Majesty is going to assign

347
00:14:18,615 --> 00:14:20,855
you to garrison duty
on the border for three years.

348
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:25,615
I expected that.

349
00:14:27,135 --> 00:14:27,936
When I

350
00:14:27,936 --> 00:14:30,135
reported Wang Yuan
to His Majesty previously,

351
00:14:30,696 --> 00:14:32,296
he acted like he trusted me

352
00:14:32,456 --> 00:14:33,255
but in fact,

353
00:14:34,135 --> 00:14:35,615
he has long been suspicious of me.

354
00:14:40,535 --> 00:14:41,336
Uncle.

355
00:14:41,775 --> 00:14:43,936
I heard that you were heading
to the border

356
00:14:44,336 --> 00:14:45,615
so I came to see you off.

357
00:14:47,424 --> 00:14:48,570
I have now lost the authority

358
00:14:48,576 --> 00:14:50,296
to allocate positions
within Imperial Guards

359
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,720
and also transferred
to the border by His Majesty.

360
00:14:52,768 --> 00:14:54,370
Everyone knows that I, Lu Jiaxue,

361
00:14:55,495 --> 00:14:56,375
lost my power

362
00:14:56,456 --> 00:14:57,936
and are avoiding me at all costs.

363
00:14:58,135 --> 00:15:00,096
Why do you come here to see me off?

364
00:15:00,535 --> 00:15:02,375
My current identity and status

365
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:04,375
are all given by you.

366
00:15:05,855 --> 00:15:07,135
I will never forget it.

367
00:15:13,255 --> 00:15:15,495
I appreciate your loyalty.

368
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,895
From today onwards,

369
00:15:23,456 --> 00:15:24,930
don't come to this residence again.

370
00:15:25,096 --> 00:15:25,895
From now on,

371
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:27,976
do not have any dealings with me

372
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:29,264
to avoid getting involved.

373
00:15:35,296 --> 00:15:37,696
Don't let our family
worry about you anymore.

374
00:15:38,135 --> 00:15:38,936
Understood.

375
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,576
Uncle,

376
00:15:40,936 --> 00:15:41,936
what is your current plan?

377
00:15:41,936 --> 00:15:43,135
You don't need to know

378
00:15:43,255 --> 00:15:44,495
my plans.

379
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:45,375
Hurry back now.

380
00:15:49,535 --> 00:15:50,576
I shall take my leave.

381
00:15:57,696 --> 00:15:58,495
Your Lordship,

382
00:15:58,576 --> 00:15:59,416
His Majesty requested

383
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:00,576
that we depart within three days

384
00:16:01,135 --> 00:16:01,936
in time...

385
00:16:02,775 --> 00:16:03,615
Three days...

386
00:16:08,696 --> 00:16:09,576
is enough.

387
00:16:36,855 --> 00:16:38,176
Chancellor Wang, how are you?

388
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,216
Greetings, Marquis Lu.

389
00:16:43,895 --> 00:16:46,096
Congratulations on your promotion

390
00:16:46,775 --> 00:16:47,976
although

391
00:16:48,936 --> 00:16:50,816
the promotion is actually a demotion.

392
00:16:51,696 --> 00:16:53,416
It seems that His Majesty has
lost his trust

393
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:55,135
in you.

394
00:16:55,168 --> 00:16:57,168
Chancellor Wang, you are quite updated
on recent news

395
00:16:57,176 --> 00:16:58,495
despite being in prison.

396
00:17:03,176 --> 00:17:06,216
Although I am imprisoned,

397
00:17:07,656 --> 00:17:09,456
that does not mean

398
00:17:09,775 --> 00:17:11,616
I am deaf or blind.

399
00:17:14,456 --> 00:17:15,656
I am here today

400
00:17:16,176 --> 00:17:17,735
to make an offer.

401
00:17:24,136 --> 00:17:25,335
Too late.

402
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:30,055
Your reluctance to take action then

403
00:17:30,535 --> 00:17:32,896
caused me to be in a dead spot now.

404
00:17:33,535 --> 00:17:35,575
What kind of deal are we talking about?

405
00:17:36,295 --> 00:17:38,936
When you betrayed the Song family,

406
00:17:39,775 --> 00:17:41,696
it was you who unwaveringly clung to me

407
00:17:41,696 --> 00:17:43,216
and let me help you rise to power.

408
00:17:43,616 --> 00:17:45,815
Yet, you attacked me in return

409
00:17:46,376 --> 00:17:49,015
and you're still dreaming
of getting away unscathed?

410
00:17:49,136 --> 00:17:50,815
It was you who forced me to do it.

411
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:51,664
I had no choice but

412
00:17:51,664 --> 00:17:53,010
to confess everything to His Majesty

413
00:17:53,015 --> 00:17:54,535
to get a chance to survive.

414
00:17:55,095 --> 00:17:55,896
You and I

415
00:17:56,896 --> 00:17:57,815
are even now.

416
00:18:04,095 --> 00:18:05,376
Lu Jiaxue,

417
00:18:07,095 --> 00:18:08,456
just wait.

418
00:18:10,575 --> 00:18:12,575
The day I die

419
00:18:14,216 --> 00:18:16,176
will be when the agreement

420
00:18:16,976 --> 00:18:19,775
becomes known to the world.

421
00:18:32,896 --> 00:18:34,376
Even ants cling to life.

422
00:18:34,936 --> 00:18:36,255
Until the very last moment,

423
00:18:37,176 --> 00:18:39,015
Chancellor Wang, why don't you
be patient

424
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,055
and listen to my offer?

425
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:20,416
Master,

426
00:19:22,815 --> 00:19:24,176
Wang Yuan was convicted

427
00:19:26,095 --> 00:19:26,896
and his accomplices

428
00:19:26,896 --> 00:19:28,176
had confessed.

429
00:19:29,696 --> 00:19:31,136
There is solid evidence

430
00:19:33,095 --> 00:19:34,456
that it was them back then

431
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,650
(Grave of Master Jiuheng)
who pushed the blame on you.

432
00:19:38,015 --> 00:19:39,095
His Majesty

433
00:19:39,575 --> 00:19:41,456
has cleared your grievances

434
00:19:42,216 --> 00:19:43,015
and

435
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:45,495
we can finally

436
00:19:45,495 --> 00:19:47,775
come to visit you openly now.

437
00:19:53,295 --> 00:19:55,616
Senior Xia and Senior Shen are here.

438
00:19:57,136 --> 00:19:58,535
We are all well.

439
00:20:00,015 --> 00:20:01,416
You can rest assured.

440
00:20:09,052 --> 00:20:11,162
(Grave of Senior Daoyan)

441
00:20:12,775 --> 00:20:14,136
Senior Daoyan is the exception.

442
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:25,775
I blame myself,

443
00:20:30,015 --> 00:20:31,656
for not being able to protect him.

444
00:20:49,575 --> 00:20:50,376
Senior Daoyan,

445
00:20:52,696 --> 00:20:54,055
you've always loved drinking.

446
00:20:55,376 --> 00:20:56,176
I brought you

447
00:20:56,176 --> 00:20:57,535
a big portion today.

448
00:20:59,616 --> 00:21:00,416
Let's

449
00:21:02,216 --> 00:21:03,856
be friends again in our next life,

450
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:07,535
but I want to be the elder one next time

451
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:10,816
so you have to listen to me
in everything.

452
00:21:12,535 --> 00:21:13,335
Shenyuan,

453
00:21:15,616 --> 00:21:17,015
you have tried your best.

454
00:21:19,216 --> 00:21:20,176
Right, Shenyuan.

455
00:21:21,896 --> 00:21:23,015
Master often quoted,

456
00:21:24,535 --> 00:21:27,416
"What joy is there in life,
and what suffering in death?

457
00:21:28,616 --> 00:21:31,616
Everything in the world
ultimately returns to the earth."

458
00:21:32,976 --> 00:21:34,575
We have to live well

459
00:21:34,575 --> 00:21:35,775
to live distinguished lives

460
00:21:37,136 --> 00:21:39,616
to live up to
the deceased's expectations.

461
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,066
(Grave of Senior Daoyan)

462
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,072
May the spirits of
the illustrious ones above

463
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,008
be honored in seasonal sacrifices,

464
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:49,536
and may they continue to
enjoy the offerings.

465
00:22:08,316 --> 00:22:10,160
(Duke Ying's Residence)

466
00:22:11,815 --> 00:22:12,696
You two, watch out.

467
00:22:12,696 --> 00:22:13,416
Grandma,

468
00:22:13,775 --> 00:22:15,815
it's Yining's big day today.

469
00:22:16,136 --> 00:22:17,335
The residence

470
00:22:17,335 --> 00:22:18,976
is chaotic like war.

471
00:22:19,176 --> 00:22:20,176
That's because

472
00:22:20,896 --> 00:22:21,896
we can't afford

473
00:22:21,896 --> 00:22:23,289
any single flaw.

474
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:25,360
The wedding of the daughter
of Duke Ying's Residence

475
00:22:25,424 --> 00:22:27,410
has to be glorious.

476
00:22:32,176 --> 00:22:32,976
Minglan,

477
00:22:34,616 --> 00:22:37,095
our daughter is getting married.

478
00:22:37,616 --> 00:22:38,616
Don't worry,

479
00:22:39,456 --> 00:22:40,775
I have looked

480
00:22:41,136 --> 00:22:42,616
into the man who will marry her.

481
00:22:43,055 --> 00:22:44,535
He is deeply affectionate to her

482
00:22:44,535 --> 00:22:45,896
and he is worthy of entrustment.

483
00:22:46,535 --> 00:22:47,575
Besides,

484
00:22:48,176 --> 00:22:50,656
if something happens someday,

485
00:22:51,015 --> 00:22:51,896
I will still be around

486
00:22:54,015 --> 00:22:55,775
and I will definitely support her.

487
00:22:55,775 --> 00:22:56,575
I will not let her

488
00:22:56,575 --> 00:22:57,775
suffer any grievances.

489
00:22:58,815 --> 00:22:59,936
However,

490
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:03,095
I didn't keep my promise back then.

491
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:04,775
I didn't give you

492
00:23:04,775 --> 00:23:06,095
a glorious wedding,

493
00:23:08,416 --> 00:23:09,696
so will you blame me?

494
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:11,696
Father,

495
00:23:12,495 --> 00:23:14,656
Mother won't blame you.

496
00:23:19,495 --> 00:23:21,416
This is something I found
in her relics.

497
00:23:22,055 --> 00:23:24,456
She left it for you.

498
00:23:44,616 --> 00:23:48,015
Since our parting, how many times
have I longed for our reunion,

499
00:23:49,295 --> 00:23:53,015
sharing dreams and souls with you.

500
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,170
Your mother had always

501
00:23:58,176 --> 00:23:59,216
kept me in her heart.

502
00:24:01,095 --> 00:24:02,495
Please don't blame yourself.

503
00:24:03,176 --> 00:24:04,656
If she is still around and sees

504
00:24:04,815 --> 00:24:06,616
you blaming yourself
like this all the time,

505
00:24:07,055 --> 00:24:08,456
she will be upset, too.

506
00:24:12,216 --> 00:24:14,535
Yining, I regret it.

507
00:24:15,255 --> 00:24:17,896
I shouldn't have agreed

508
00:24:17,896 --> 00:24:19,735
to let him marry you so quickly.

509
00:24:19,856 --> 00:24:20,656
How about

510
00:24:21,456 --> 00:24:23,095
we delay

511
00:24:24,176 --> 00:24:25,376
the wedding to a later time?

512
00:24:26,376 --> 00:24:27,176
Father,

513
00:24:27,775 --> 00:24:29,176
even if I get married,

514
00:24:29,295 --> 00:24:30,495
I am also Yining,

515
00:24:30,656 --> 00:24:32,176
your daughter.

516
00:25:01,818 --> 00:25:03,529
(Duke Ying's Residence)

517
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,530
If a thief shows up, he must be struck;

518
00:25:23,535 --> 00:25:26,535
if a guest shows up, we must receive them.

519
00:25:31,335 --> 00:25:32,055
Please.

520
00:25:38,021 --> 00:25:41,005
(Double Happiness)

521
00:25:56,616 --> 00:25:58,015
(Do you really like him?)

522
00:25:58,015 --> 00:25:58,456
(I do!)

523
00:25:58,456 --> 00:25:59,936
(Are you sure it's romance)

524
00:25:59,936 --> 00:26:01,095
instead of siblings?

525
00:26:01,456 --> 00:26:02,376
I am sure

526
00:26:02,376 --> 00:26:04,495
that I'll only love him
for the rest of my life.

527
00:26:36,376 --> 00:26:38,295
Marquis Lu, everything is ready.

528
00:26:50,015 --> 00:26:51,896
I, Yining, bid farewell to Grandma.

529
00:26:52,535 --> 00:26:55,095
May you always be in good health

530
00:26:55,295 --> 00:26:56,456
and peace.

531
00:27:00,295 --> 00:27:00,856
Alright.

532
00:27:00,856 --> 00:27:01,735
You may get up.

533
00:27:07,176 --> 00:27:08,095
Yining,

534
00:27:08,815 --> 00:27:09,976
this bracelet

535
00:27:10,015 --> 00:27:12,616
is an heirloom of our Wei family.

536
00:27:13,416 --> 00:27:14,495
It should have

537
00:27:15,775 --> 00:27:18,095
been passed down to your mother.

538
00:27:18,616 --> 00:27:21,295
I will pass it on to you now.

539
00:27:22,095 --> 00:27:25,255
Here, let me put it on for you.

540
00:27:35,376 --> 00:27:37,696
Encouragement and respect,

541
00:27:38,176 --> 00:27:43,295
day and night, do not violate
the etiquette of your chamber.

542
00:27:45,216 --> 00:27:47,775
I will keep your words in mind

543
00:27:48,495 --> 00:27:49,936
day and night, without fault.

544
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:13,184
No need for formalities.

00:28:19,775 --> 00:28:21,335
help me pass the message
to Luo Shenyuan

547
00:28:22,255 --> 00:28:24,055
that I will never forgive him

548
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:26,144
if he ever dares to bully you.

549
00:28:28,616 --> 00:28:30,136
Look at yourself,

550
00:28:30,255 --> 00:28:31,775
your daughter is getting married now.

551
00:28:31,775 --> 00:28:33,295
Why did you say that?

552
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,464
I'm just following the principle
of first courtesy, then force.

Yining...

554
00:28:48,775 --> 00:28:50,616
I feel like you just returned yesterday.

555
00:28:50,616 --> 00:28:52,176

Besides,

568
00:29:27,136 --> 00:29:29,416

doesn't sneak drinks.

Yining,

570
00:29:34,295 --> 00:29:35,176
I understand.

571
00:29:35,216 --> 00:29:36,176
I will help Father

572
00:29:36,176 --> 00:29:37,416
with applying medicine myself.

573
00:29:38,616 --> 00:29:39,616
Yining, don't worry.

574
00:29:39,735 --> 00:29:41,015

this gift box

We have no idea

598
00:34:03,856 --> 00:34:04,775
which family sent it.

599
00:34:04,775 --> 00:34:05,815

Second Aunt, calm down.

606
00:34:17,856 --> 00:34:19,376
You've been asking for a dozen times.

607
00:34:19,535 --> 00:34:20,296
I'm just worried

608
00:34:20,296 --> 00:34:22,015
that Duke Ying is giving trouble
to Shenyuan.

609
00:34:22,015 --> 00:34:23,856
He's probably reluctant
to let Yining come here.

Hairu,

611
00:34:26,416 --> 00:34:28,336

Vice Minister Luo,

718
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:59,490
we have searched the street

719
00:40:59,495 --> 00:41:01,015
but no trace of Wang was found.

720
00:41:01,135 --> 00:41:01,936
Continue searching.

721
00:41:01,976 --> 00:41:03,095
Yes. Go.

722
00:41:04,776 --> 00:41:05,615
Search over there.

723
00:41:05,615 --> 00:41:06,215
Yes.

724
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:15,776
The groom is out for work matters.

725
00:41:16,215 --> 00:41:17,776
Is the bride upset about this?

726
00:41:18,095 --> 00:41:20,535
We are a couple, of course
we understand each other.

733
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:31,210
The criminals escaped
from Imperial Court of Judicial

734
00:41:31,216 --> 00:41:32,730
so Imperial Guard came to assist.

735
00:41:32,976 --> 00:41:34,615
That is fast.

736
00:41:34,856 --> 00:41:36,135
Such foresight suggests that you

737
00:41:36,575 --> 00:41:37,609
must have known in advance

738
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:39,568
that Wang Yuan was planning
to escape from prison.

739
00:41:39,615 --> 00:41:40,776

740
00:41:40,816 --> 00:41:42,575
have always been well-informed.

741
00:41:44,055 --> 00:41:44,816
That's sharp.

742
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:46,032
What's the issue here?

743
00:41:46,055 --> 00:41:46,856
Aren't you

744
00:41:46,856 --> 00:41:48,215
worried about yourself at all?

745
00:41:48,936 --> 00:41:50,615
The criminals escaped from your place.

746
00:41:50,816 --> 00:41:52,416
The constituting of dereliction of duty

747
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:54,416

00:41:55,175 --> 00:41:56,416
Thank you for the reminder.

749
00:42:16,896 --> 00:42:17,736
Any updates?

750
00:42:18,010 --> 00:42:18,800
Have you found them?

751
00:42:18,856 --> 00:42:19,776
No.

752
00:42:19,984 --> 00:42:20,432
Fine.

753
00:42:20,432 --> 00:42:21,440
Look for them separately.

754
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:21,808
Sure.

755
00:42:24,135 --> 00:42:25,495
Give it to me.

756
00:42:25,495 --> 00:42:26,615
What's the hurry?

757
00:42:26,615 --> 00:42:27,950
Let's talk after we leave the city.

758
00:42:29,976 --> 00:42:30,575
No.

759
00:42:31,776 --> 00:42:33,095
Tomorrow noon,

760
00:42:33,135 --> 00:42:35,575
my old servant

761
00:42:35,615 --> 00:42:37,535
will take it to my old residence.

762
00:42:37,535 --> 00:42:40,495
You can go retrieve it then.

763
00:42:41,776 --> 00:42:43,615
Look, don't worry.

764
00:42:43,816 --> 00:42:45,015
I'm already out of prison.

765
00:42:45,015 --> 00:42:45,495
That thing

766
00:42:45,495 --> 00:42:46,976
is no longer of use to me.

767
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:52,215
Chancellor Wang, I'll lure them away.

768
00:42:52,215 --> 00:42:53,416
Sure, go.

769
00:42:56,095 --> 00:42:57,376
He's there! Go!

770
00:42:58,015 --> 00:42:58,816
