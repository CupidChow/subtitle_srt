4
00:01:54,573 --> 00:01:55,573
Third Brother!

5
00:02:02,135 --> 00:02:03,854
How much did your employer pay you?

6
00:02:03,855 --> 00:02:05,175
I'm willing to pay double

7
00:02:05,176 --> 00:02:06,375
as long as you let us go.

8
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:07,936
We are just bandits.

9
00:02:07,976 --> 00:02:09,975
We want to kidnap you to get a ransom.

10
00:02:09,976 --> 00:02:11,414
No one hired us.

11
00:02:11,415 --> 00:02:13,495
You still haven't passed out
after inhaling so much drug.

12
00:02:13,496 --> 00:02:14,576
Not bad.

13
00:02:29,455 --> 00:02:30,375
Third Brother.

14
00:02:31,455 --> 00:02:32,576
Third Brother.

15
00:02:34,015 --> 00:02:35,055
What's wrong?

16
00:02:35,256 --> 00:02:36,736
Hold on.

17
00:02:37,096 --> 00:02:38,576
We'll arrive soon.

18
00:02:39,855 --> 00:02:40,976
Third Brother.

19
00:02:42,895 --> 00:02:44,655
Talk to me.

20
00:02:45,855 --> 00:02:47,655
We'll arrive soon, Third Brother.

21
00:02:50,455 --> 00:02:51,495
Third Brother!

22
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,055
Third Brother.

23
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:57,256
Third Brother, wake up!

24
00:02:59,015 --> 00:03:00,215
Get up.

25
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:03,655
Third Brother.

26
00:03:04,216 --> 00:03:05,576
I'm bringing you back home.

27
00:03:12,216 --> 00:03:13,215
Get up.

28
00:03:13,575 --> 00:03:14,615
Third Brother.

29
00:03:22,015 --> 00:03:23,016
Get up.

30
00:03:25,336 --> 00:03:26,375
Third Young Master!

31
00:03:26,575 --> 00:03:27,414
Young Master!

32
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:28,414
Seventh Lady!

33
00:03:28,415 --> 00:03:29,416
Seventh Lady!

34
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:31,375
Shao'an.

35
00:03:31,575 --> 00:03:32,576
Shao'an!

36
00:03:32,776 --> 00:03:33,569
We are here!

37
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:34,719
Seventh Lady! Young Master!

38
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,010
- We are coming!
- Third Young Master!

39
00:03:41,776 --> 00:03:42,815
You're back?

40
00:03:43,895 --> 00:03:46,375
Madam, it's terrible.

41
00:03:46,895 --> 00:03:48,176
It failed?

42
00:03:48,216 --> 00:03:49,414
I heard

43
00:03:49,415 --> 00:03:51,294
Yang Qinghua is still

44
00:03:51,295 --> 00:03:52,976
in Minglan Hall.

45
00:03:53,096 --> 00:03:53,935
I'm worried

46
00:03:53,936 --> 00:03:56,215
that the two bandits
kidnapped the wrong person.

47
00:03:56,216 --> 00:03:57,615
Who did

48
00:03:57,816 --> 00:03:59,536
the two of them kidnap?

49
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,341
I was useless.

50
00:04:02,496 --> 00:04:03,574
I thought

51
00:04:03,575 --> 00:04:05,014
that everywhere was unsafe

52
00:04:05,015 --> 00:04:07,414
so I hired two bandits to rob them

53
00:04:07,415 --> 00:04:08,894
so no one would find anything

54
00:04:08,895 --> 00:04:10,775
if people investigate it.

55
00:04:11,415 --> 00:04:12,495
I didn't expect...

56
00:04:13,015 --> 00:04:15,375
Do the two bandits recognize you?

57
00:04:15,575 --> 00:04:17,414
I was wearing a veiled hat all the time.

58
00:04:17,415 --> 00:04:19,935
The bandits have never seen my face.

59
00:04:21,896 --> 00:04:22,976
That's good enough.

60
00:04:23,415 --> 00:04:25,615
Let's not panic.

61
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,280
(Liuhe Tavern)

62
00:04:34,295 --> 00:04:35,296
Qing Qu.

63
00:04:36,576 --> 00:04:38,495
Why hasn't Third Brother woken up yet?

64
00:04:40,336 --> 00:04:41,934
When realgar powder is heated,

65
00:04:41,935 --> 00:04:43,335
it becomes highly toxic.

66
00:04:43,336 --> 00:04:45,414
It is dangerous to inhale a lot of it.

67
00:04:45,415 --> 00:04:47,174
However, Third Young Master is strong

68
00:04:47,175 --> 00:04:48,536
and he took medicine in time.

69
00:04:48,576 --> 00:04:51,216
He will wake up
after resting for a while.

70
00:04:53,495 --> 00:04:55,494
Seventh Lady, you just woke up as well.

71
00:04:55,495 --> 00:04:56,575
Your health is important.

72
00:04:56,576 --> 00:04:58,536
Why don't you go back and rest?

73
00:04:58,776 --> 00:05:00,615
I want to stay here
and accompany Third Brother.

76
00:05:24,016 --> 00:05:25,615
Third Brother almost fell down the cliff

77
00:05:26,216 --> 00:05:27,815
because of me

78
00:05:27,896 --> 00:05:29,575
back in the estate.

79
00:05:31,016 --> 00:05:32,135
This time,

80
00:05:33,016 --> 00:05:34,815
he was almost killed as well.

81
00:05:37,016 --> 00:05:39,535
I shouldn't put himself in this trouble.

82
00:05:39,536 --> 00:05:41,095
Don't say that.

83
00:05:41,096 --> 00:05:43,328
Those men were too cruel.

84
00:05:43,329 --> 00:05:44,414
Yes, Seventh Lady.

85
00:05:44,415 --> 00:05:46,135
Don't say such a thing.

86
00:05:46,136 --> 00:05:48,416
When Young Master wakes up,
he will be angry at you.

87
00:05:49,815 --> 00:05:51,976
I'm willing to see him get angry.

88
00:05:53,415 --> 00:05:55,135
At least, he is awake

89

00:06:25,855 --> 00:06:26,856
Third Brother.

95
00:06:29,622 --> 00:06:30,743
Are you awake?

96
00:06:36,776 --> 00:06:39,216
I do feel like sleeping
for a while longer.

97
00:06:39,776 --> 00:06:42,815
If you are still crying here,

98
00:06:43,136 --> 00:06:44,615
how can I sleep?

99
00:06:53,415 --> 00:06:54,655
I didn't know

100
00:06:54,656 --> 00:06:56,176
you were such a crybaby in the past.

101
00:06:59,415 --> 00:07:01,096
You know now.

102
00:07:01,896 --> 00:07:03,336
Even so, it's too late.

103
00:07:15,415 --> 00:07:16,416
Ms. Yang.

104
00:07:18,175 --> 00:07:20,015
Ms. Yang, what are you doing?

105
00:07:20,016 --> 00:07:21,216
Please stand.

106
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,641
I almost made you lose your life.

107
00:07:23,656 --> 00:07:25,495
I am embarrassed to see you.

108
00:07:25,776 --> 00:07:26,854
Ms. Yang,

109
00:07:26,855 --> 00:07:28,296
don't say that.

110
00:07:28,336 --> 00:07:29,375
Stand up.

111
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:32,095
We don't know

112
00:07:32,096 --> 00:07:33,416
who harmed whom

113
00:07:33,424 --> 00:07:34,825
in this incident.

114
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:38,095
Ms. Yang, are you leaving?

115
00:07:38,096 --> 00:07:40,414
Thanks to Seventh Lady
and Third Young Master's help,

116
00:07:40,415 --> 00:07:41,934
I've found my brother.

117
00:07:41,935 --> 00:07:44,216
We agreed to leave the capital.

118
00:07:45,295 --> 00:07:46,375
Have you both

119
00:07:46,415 --> 00:07:48,015
thought about where to go?

120
00:07:48,615 --> 00:07:49,935
We haven't.

121
00:07:50,175 --> 00:07:52,536
However, reuniting with my family

122
00:07:52,976 --> 00:07:54,416
is better than anything.

123
00:07:56,096 --> 00:07:57,775
Do you have enough money?

124
00:07:57,776 --> 00:07:58,934
I do.

125
00:07:58,935 --> 00:07:59,935
Seventh Lady,

126
00:08:00,216 --> 00:08:01,575
I was wondering

127
00:08:01,576 --> 00:08:03,575
if I should tell you
about this previously

128
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:05,375
but after what I went through,

129
00:08:07,175 --> 00:08:08,935
I won't hide anything from you.

130
00:08:09,935 --> 00:08:12,335
I met First Master Luo

131
00:08:12,336 --> 00:08:13,934
when he was drunk previously.

132
00:08:13,935 --> 00:08:15,575
He held my hand

133
00:08:15,735 --> 00:08:16,896
and shouted Minglan.

134
00:08:17,415 --> 00:08:19,736
I think Minglan

135
00:08:20,295 --> 00:08:21,414
should be the person

136
00:08:21,415 --> 00:08:23,015
whom Minglan Hall was named after.

137
00:08:26,336 --> 00:08:28,375
Madam Chen even saw me that day.

138
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,810
I couldn't give
any convincing explanation.

139
00:08:31,576 --> 00:08:33,095
Minglan, it really is you.

140
00:08:33,696 --> 00:08:34,695
Minglan.

141
00:08:34,895 --> 00:08:35,855
Minglan.

142
00:08:36,895 --> 00:08:38,055
First Master!

143
00:08:40,296 --> 00:08:42,134
Seventh Lady, don't worry.

144
00:08:42,135 --> 00:08:43,175
I'm only

145
00:08:43,176 --> 00:08:45,136
telling this to you.

146
00:08:45,216 --> 00:08:47,776
I won't tell anyone else about this
in the future.

147
00:08:47,816 --> 00:08:50,616
You and Third Young Master saved me.

148
00:08:50,735 --> 00:08:52,575
I will never bite the hand that feeds me

149
00:08:52,576 --> 00:08:55,296
and do anything
that tarnishes Madam Gu's reputation.

150
00:09:07,135 --> 00:09:08,176
Ms. Yang.

151
00:09:08,775 --> 00:09:10,975
Sixth Uncle made this medicine.

152
00:09:10,976 --> 00:09:12,815
Apply it a few times

153
00:09:12,816 --> 00:09:14,616
and your leg will heal quickly.

154
00:09:14,735 --> 00:09:16,016
Thank you, Seventh Lady.

155
00:09:16,176 --> 00:09:18,776
Also, this is your bracelet.
I'm giving it back to you.

156
00:09:20,696 --> 00:09:23,376
Seventh Lady, farewell.

157
00:09:24,495 --> 00:09:25,496
Take care.

158
00:09:27,615 --> 00:09:28,616
You too.

159
00:09:46,976 --> 00:09:48,695
Do you suspect

160
00:09:49,176 --> 00:09:50,735
that the two bandits were hired?

161
00:09:53,015 --> 00:09:54,896
If they only wanted to kidnap me,

162
00:09:55,135 --> 00:09:56,975
they should confined me instead.

163
00:09:57,495 --> 00:09:58,616
There was no need for them

164
00:09:58,936 --> 00:10:00,415
to trap me in a coffin

165
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:01,815
and kill me.

166
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:03,416
Besides,

167
00:10:04,015 --> 00:10:05,335
I have a feeling

168
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:06,975
that they kidnapped the wrong person.

169
00:10:07,216 --> 00:10:09,496
They wanted to kidnap Yang Qinghua.

170
00:10:12,096 --> 00:10:13,095
All right.

171
00:10:13,735 --> 00:10:14,735
I'll investigate them.

172
00:10:15,294 --> 00:10:16,293
Sit down!

173
00:10:16,615 --> 00:10:17,534
Talk!

174
00:10:17,535 --> 00:10:19,176
Who sent you both?

175
00:10:19,576 --> 00:10:20,614
Who are you?

176
00:10:20,615 --> 00:10:22,296
Who are you to tie me up?

177
00:10:24,495 --> 00:10:25,734
Can you talk now?

178
00:10:25,735 --> 00:10:27,376
All right. I'll talk.

179
00:10:27,895 --> 00:10:28,815
It was a woman

180
00:10:28,816 --> 00:10:30,016
wearing a veiled hat.

181
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:31,975
I saw nothing.

182
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:35,215
How is it?

183
00:10:35,976 --> 00:10:37,095
I investigated it.

184
00:10:37,296 --> 00:10:39,179
A woman hired them.

185
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,376
She wore a veiled hat all the time
and they couldn't see her face clearly.

186
00:10:43,005 --> 00:10:44,815
They were indeed hired to murder people.

187
00:10:45,775 --> 00:10:46,815
However,

188
00:10:46,816 --> 00:10:49,016
who will try to harm Ms. Yang?

189
00:10:49,135 --> 00:10:51,616
She just arrived at the capital
and had no relatives.

190
00:10:51,696 --> 00:10:52,815
Those who know her

191
00:10:52,816 --> 00:10:54,376
are all from Luo Residence.

192
00:10:56,096 --> 00:10:57,095
Let's go back.

193
00:10:57,576 --> 00:10:59,975
We can't solve this immediately

194
00:11:00,015 --> 00:11:01,695
and we have been out for so long.

195
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:11,575
Old Madam, Seventh Lady is back.

196
00:11:14,976 --> 00:11:16,016
Grandma.

197
00:11:16,735 --> 00:11:17,776
Grandma.

198
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:19,815
I've made you worried.

199
00:11:20,696 --> 00:11:22,735
You are finally back.

200
00:11:22,976 --> 00:11:24,136
Are you all right?

201
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:26,016
I'm fine.

202
00:11:26,272 --> 00:11:27,551
Are you sure?

203
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:28,980
Yes.

204
00:11:29,015 --> 00:11:31,695
Look. We came back healthily.

205
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:35,295
Sure. Go back and rest then.

206
00:11:35,296 --> 00:11:37,776
I have something to ask Shenyuan.

207
00:11:37,816 --> 00:11:38,815
Grandma,

208
00:11:39,296 --> 00:11:40,975
I know what you want to ask.

209
00:11:40,976 --> 00:11:42,176
There's no need

210
00:11:42,296 --> 00:11:43,815
to hide this from Yining.

211
00:11:43,816 --> 00:11:46,296
I've handed over the testimony
to Duke Ying.

212
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:49,524
Duke Ying?

213
00:11:50,096 --> 00:11:51,376
Please punish me, Grandma.

214
00:11:51,895 --> 00:11:53,014
However, I guarantee

215
00:11:53,015 --> 00:11:54,095
that this matter

216
00:11:54,096 --> 00:11:55,616
will not involve Luo Residence.

217
00:11:56,895 --> 00:11:59,374
Grandma, don't blame Third Brother.

218
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,095
He isn't a reckless person.

219
00:12:01,096 --> 00:12:03,416
He only did it
because he was confident of succeeding.

220
00:12:04,216 --> 00:12:06,488
Duke Ying and Wang Yuan

221
00:12:06,489 --> 00:12:08,370
have always been against each other.

222
00:12:08,576 --> 00:12:11,059
The testimony might be useful

223
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,899
in his hands.

224
00:12:20,336 --> 00:12:21,335
You are smart.

225
00:12:21,553 --> 00:12:23,714
Each of you is smarter than the other.

226
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:24,975
You already know

227
00:12:24,976 --> 00:12:27,616
how to use leverage at a young age.

228
00:12:28,576 --> 00:12:29,575
Smart.

229
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:32,376
Ning,

230
00:12:33,015 --> 00:12:34,855
don't worry me.

231
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:36,776
Stay in the residence

232
00:12:36,936 --> 00:12:39,776
and don't go out in the near future.

233
00:12:41,056 --> 00:12:42,537
Yes, Grandma.

234
00:12:42,976 --> 00:12:45,335
Grandma, you should rest early too.

235
00:13:00,855 --> 00:13:01,815
Young Master,

236
00:13:01,816 --> 00:13:02,975
Qi An said the testimony

237
00:13:02,976 --> 00:13:04,536
had been handed over to Duke Ying.

238
00:13:04,735 --> 00:13:06,175
However, why are you so sure

239
00:13:06,176 --> 00:13:08,335
that they will do things
according to our plan?

240
00:13:08,936 --> 00:13:11,215
That depends on whether he trusts us

241
00:13:11,216 --> 00:13:13,175
or Wang Yuan.

242
00:13:13,176 --> 00:13:14,176
Third Brother.

243
00:13:16,775 --> 00:13:17,975
It's time to take your medicine.

244
00:13:19,336 --> 00:13:20,616
I've recovered.

245
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:51,095
Is it sweet?

246
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:53,416
It is.

247
00:13:54,615 --> 00:13:56,616
I purposely
bought this for you this morning.

248
00:13:56,976 --> 00:13:58,335
I'm not a child.

249
00:13:58,696 --> 00:14:00,376
I won't ask for a reward
after suffering.

250
00:14:00,976 --> 00:14:03,975
You've suffered so much for my sake.

251
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:05,376
Thankfully, you are fine.

252
00:14:06,696 --> 00:14:08,136
Even if I did it for you,

253
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:10,016
I will also protect myself.

254
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:18,896
What's wrong with you?

255
00:14:18,976 --> 00:14:21,575
My throat feels a little unwell.

256
00:14:22,615 --> 00:14:23,975
Did you catch a cold?

257
00:14:23,976 --> 00:14:25,494
Let me take you outside
and check on you.

258
00:14:25,495 --> 00:14:26,374
Don't stay inside the house

259
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:28,215
and infect
Third Young Master and Seventh Lady.

260
00:14:28,216 --> 00:14:28,855
Let's go.

261
00:14:29,056 --> 00:14:30,016
My throat is fine.

262
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:31,256
It's really fine.

263
00:14:33,176 --> 00:14:34,175
Regarding Chen Lan...

264
00:14:34,176 --> 00:14:35,335
Stop.

265
00:14:35,336 --> 00:14:36,815
I know what you want to say.

266
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:39,335
If I want to deal with her,

267
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:40,894
I will tell you in advance.

268
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:43,016
- About this...
- You should focus on your recovery.

269
00:14:46,696 --> 00:14:48,176
But this matter...

270
00:14:56,535 --> 00:14:57,536
Young Lady.

271
00:14:57,696 --> 00:14:59,374
Third Master is fine now.

272
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:00,695
There's no need to worry.

273
00:15:01,615 --> 00:15:04,016
Thankfully,
Third Brother is safe this time.

274
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:05,935
He just became the provincial scholar.

275
00:15:05,936 --> 00:15:08,776
If he got hurt because of me again,

276
00:15:09,096 --> 00:15:10,815
I couldn't be at ease.

277
00:15:10,895 --> 00:15:12,734
Young Lady, who do you think

278
00:15:12,735 --> 00:15:13,975
hired the two bandits

279
00:15:13,976 --> 00:15:15,376
to harm Ms. Yang?

280
00:15:15,895 --> 00:15:17,776
Ms. Yang left

281
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:19,975
because she was worried
that there would be a misunderstanding

282
00:15:19,976 --> 00:15:22,016
between Aunt and Uncle.

283
00:15:22,336 --> 00:15:23,536
Are you saying

284
00:15:23,568 --> 00:15:25,815
it was Madam Chen who hired them?

285
00:15:26,895 --> 00:15:29,176
I don't have exact proof now.

286
00:15:29,816 --> 00:15:31,374
I was wondering

287
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:33,296
why she would harm my mother

288
00:15:33,336 --> 00:15:36,016
but it does seem like
she is a cruel person indeed.

289
00:15:36,176 --> 00:15:37,935
If she knew

290
00:15:37,936 --> 00:15:39,534
Uncle had other intentions

291
00:15:39,535 --> 00:15:40,815
towards my mother,

292
00:15:40,816 --> 00:15:43,136
I don't think
she would forgive my mother.

293
00:15:43,296 --> 00:15:45,815
Did Mistress Qiao and Madam Chen

294
00:15:45,816 --> 00:15:47,815
work together to murder Madam Gu?

295
00:15:48,096 --> 00:15:51,136
Mistress Qiao denied this previously.

296
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:53,494
I think it made sense.

297
00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:55,575
She had no reason to harm my mother.

298
00:15:55,576 --> 00:15:57,614
However, I also believe

299
00:15:57,615 --> 00:15:59,014
that she was willing
to stand by and watch

300
00:15:59,015 --> 00:16:00,415
someone else to the deed.

301
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:01,575
Young Lady,

302
00:16:01,816 --> 00:16:03,014
are you still going to the estate

303
00:16:03,015 --> 00:16:04,536
to find Mistress Qiao?

304
00:16:04,576 --> 00:16:06,335
Since she denied

305
00:16:06,336 --> 00:16:08,095
about being involved in this,

306
00:16:08,096 --> 00:16:09,616
she wouldn't be changing her statement

307
00:16:09,696 --> 00:16:11,296
if we don't have strong evidence.

308
00:16:11,976 --> 00:16:13,695
What should we do then?

309
00:16:14,816 --> 00:16:15,894
We need

310
00:16:15,895 --> 00:16:17,415
to plan further for this.

311
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:20,095
If Aunt was the one who did it,

312
00:16:20,296 --> 00:16:22,935
I will make her pay the price.

313
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:25,494
The provincial scholar's banquet
is happening now

314
00:16:25,495 --> 00:16:27,215
so we can't cause any unwanted trouble.

315
00:16:27,296 --> 00:16:28,416
We should go back first.

316
00:16:34,176 --> 00:16:35,176
Qiao,

317
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:38,616
someone sent you a letter.

318
00:16:40,056 --> 00:16:41,095
Thank you.

319
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,340
(Luo Xuanyuan got 34th
in the triennial provincial exam.)

320
00:16:49,615 --> 00:16:50,935
My Xuan!

321
00:16:51,296 --> 00:16:53,215
Lady! Look!

322
00:16:53,216 --> 00:16:54,335
My son!

323
00:16:54,336 --> 00:16:55,894
My son has succeeded
in the provincial exam!

324
00:16:55,895 --> 00:16:56,802
My son!

325
00:16:56,803 --> 00:16:58,682
Look! My son!

326
00:16:58,696 --> 00:16:59,935
This is my son!

327
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:01,494
My son has succeeded!

328
00:17:01,495 --> 00:17:03,494
- We know.
- My son!

329
00:17:03,495 --> 00:17:05,535
Third Young Master
also became the provincial scholar.

330
00:17:06,535 --> 00:17:07,935
Third Young Master?

331
00:17:07,936 --> 00:17:10,094
The one who was unpopular,

332
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:11,136
Luo Shenyuan.

333
00:17:16,008 --> 00:17:16,880
Is that even necessary?

334
00:17:18,616 --> 00:17:19,734
Supervisor Li,

335
00:17:19,735 --> 00:17:21,774
where did the two madams come from?

336
00:17:21,775 --> 00:17:23,535
They are new here.
They are from another village.

337
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:26,416
Does our estate still lack people?

338
00:17:27,176 --> 00:17:29,535
Why are you asking this?
Get back to work.

339
00:17:43,815 --> 00:17:45,774
Buddha,
please bless my brother, Lin Mao,

340
00:17:45,775 --> 00:17:46,975
to return safely

341
00:17:46,976 --> 00:17:48,616
without any major incidents.

342
00:17:49,616 --> 00:17:51,415
Buddha, please bless Luo Residence

343
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:52,816
with peace and prosperity.

344
00:17:53,295 --> 00:17:55,735
Bless my mother-in-law with longevity.

345
00:17:56,535 --> 00:17:58,975
Bless my Yining with health

346
00:17:59,216 --> 00:18:00,816
and a good husband

347
00:18:01,136 --> 00:18:03,136
so she can live a good life.

348
00:18:03,376 --> 00:18:05,494
Bless Yuan with success

349
00:18:05,495 --> 00:18:07,176
in every examination

350
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:08,495
and a smooth career.

351
00:18:08,616 --> 00:18:11,215
Bless Xuan with success
in the examination as well

352
00:18:11,295 --> 00:18:12,816
to bring honour to the Luo family.

353
00:18:13,216 --> 00:18:15,816
Bless Yilian with a successful marriage.

354
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:18,816
Bless us...

355
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:24,896
Bless Second Master

356
00:18:25,535 --> 00:18:26,896
with safety

357
00:18:27,495 --> 00:18:29,136
and harmony between us
as husband and wife.

358
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:37,906
♪The moon may wane, but it
becomes full when loved ones return♪

359
00:18:50,656 --> 00:18:51,656
Hairu,

360
00:18:52,095 --> 00:18:53,215
seriously.

361
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:55,415
You just recovered but you still
insisted on redeeming your vow.

362
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:57,176
After you redeemed your vows,

363
00:18:57,335 --> 00:18:59,295
you were still talking so much.

364
00:18:59,535 --> 00:19:02,295
Buddha isn't so free
to hear all your requests.

365
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:03,896
You redeemed your vows, made your wish,

366
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:05,964
and even had to have
a vegetarian meal there.

367
00:19:06,335 --> 00:19:07,734
By departing now,

368
00:19:07,735 --> 00:19:10,015
we will only arrive
at Luo Residence at night.

369
00:19:12,295 --> 00:19:15,175
Making a wish to Buddha
is all about sincerity.

370
00:19:15,176 --> 00:19:17,975
Besides, there's still
a long time until dusk.

371
00:19:17,976 --> 00:19:20,535
Don't you know
that there's a war at the border?

372
00:19:20,575 --> 00:19:21,534
There are many bandits.

373
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:23,495
This area is dangerous.

374
00:19:27,255 --> 00:19:28,735
What's going on?

375
00:19:28,976 --> 00:19:31,416
Butler Bai, what's going on?

376
00:19:32,055 --> 00:19:34,255
In broad daylight, both of you are...

377
00:19:45,416 --> 00:19:46,735
Who are you?

378
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:49,495
- Do you know who...
- I don't care who you are!

379
00:19:49,575 --> 00:19:51,895
Be lenient.

380
00:19:51,896 --> 00:19:53,014
Let's talk this out.

381
00:19:53,015 --> 00:19:54,015
Get out.

382
00:19:54,295 --> 00:19:55,535
Sure.

383
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:57,775
Stay here and don't move.

384
00:19:57,815 --> 00:19:58,775
Yes.

385
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:00,656
Hurry up!

386
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:03,734
Give me all the valuable items on you.

387
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:06,015
Both of you just want money, right?

388
00:20:06,216 --> 00:20:07,176
That's easy.

389
00:20:09,616 --> 00:20:11,294
Remove what's on your head as well.

390
00:20:11,295 --> 00:20:12,856
- Hurry!
- Hurry!

391
00:20:14,095 --> 00:20:14,856
Sure.

392
00:20:24,295 --> 00:20:25,295
Both of you,

393
00:20:25,775 --> 00:20:28,215
I've given you
all the valuable items on me.

394
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:33,574
Your clothes look nice.

395
00:20:33,575 --> 00:20:34,616
Take it off.

396
00:20:34,976 --> 00:20:36,336
I am a scholar.

397
00:20:37,495 --> 00:20:38,814
This is a humiliation.

398
00:20:38,815 --> 00:20:39,775
Hurry!

399
00:20:39,896 --> 00:20:41,616
Sure. No problem.

400
00:20:42,535 --> 00:20:44,896
Take it off.
Your life is more important.

401
00:20:45,055 --> 00:20:47,215
This is ridiculous.

402
00:20:48,656 --> 00:20:49,656
Here you go.

403
00:20:53,015 --> 00:20:54,735
The hat is not bad too.

404
00:20:59,015 --> 00:21:00,015
Just give it to them.

405
00:21:00,095 --> 00:21:00,896
Hurry up.

406
00:21:02,815 --> 00:21:04,015
Hurry up.

407
00:21:05,255 --> 00:21:06,816
Are you not willing to give it to us?

408
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:11,535
The size is just right.

409
00:21:12,616 --> 00:21:14,015
Can we leave now?

410
00:21:15,335 --> 00:21:16,336
Hold it!

411
00:21:22,976 --> 00:21:24,775
Both of you, go there!

412
00:21:25,616 --> 00:21:27,175
This is the wilderness.

413
00:21:27,176 --> 00:21:29,375
We can't go back
without a horse carriage.

414
00:21:29,376 --> 00:21:30,295
Move!

415
00:21:31,015 --> 00:21:32,775
Calm down.

416
00:21:32,815 --> 00:21:33,896
Both of you,

417
00:21:33,936 --> 00:21:35,294
my husband is weak

418
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:36,416
and is spouting nonsense.

419
00:21:36,976 --> 00:21:37,655
Let's go.

420
00:21:37,656 --> 00:21:39,534
You are a lucky man!

421
00:21:39,535 --> 00:21:40,495
Get lost!

422
00:21:41,815 --> 00:21:43,416
Butler Bai, let's go!

423
00:21:43,535 --> 00:21:44,576
Let's go!

424
00:21:48,815 --> 00:21:50,416
Mother, you are great

425
00:21:50,616 --> 00:21:53,535
but you must still
take care of your safety.

426
00:21:54,535 --> 00:21:56,616
I didn't do anything today

427
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,175
but I didn't expect

428
00:21:58,176 --> 00:22:01,015
the situation
to be so dangerous out there.

429
00:22:01,575 --> 00:22:02,975
I don't know

430
00:22:02,976 --> 00:22:04,535
how Mao is doing now.

431
00:22:04,735 --> 00:22:06,375
I'm sure Sixth Uncle will be fine.

432
00:22:06,376 --> 00:22:07,416
Don't worry.

433
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:10,416
Mother.

434
00:22:10,656 --> 00:22:12,975
Third Brother asked me
to give this medicine to you.

435
00:22:12,976 --> 00:22:15,135
Apply it to your wound twice a day

436
00:22:15,136 --> 00:22:16,416
just in case.

437
00:22:16,896 --> 00:22:18,415
I made this kid worry.

438
00:22:18,416 --> 00:22:19,695
I'm really fine.

439
00:22:24,575 --> 00:22:25,616
Father.

440
00:22:30,976 --> 00:22:32,775
Why is Father...

441
00:22:34,616 --> 00:22:37,574
Your father was shocked.

442
00:22:37,575 --> 00:22:39,051
A scholar like him

443
00:22:39,052 --> 00:22:40,215
cared too much about his reputation.

444
00:22:40,216 --> 00:22:42,415
He got his clothes and hat

445
00:22:42,416 --> 00:22:44,176
taken away by the bandits.

446
00:22:44,976 --> 00:22:46,775
I said he was confused.

447
00:22:46,815 --> 00:22:48,896
All of those mean nothing.

448
00:22:48,936 --> 00:22:52,175
Isn't it good enough
for the whole family

449
00:22:52,176 --> 00:22:53,254
to be safe together?

450
00:22:53,255 --> 00:22:54,495
Am I right?

451
00:23:07,176 --> 00:23:08,175
Vice Minister,

452
00:23:08,176 --> 00:23:09,735
did you sleep in the palace again
last night?

453
00:23:10,216 --> 00:23:12,935
This case suddenly caused a stir.

454
00:23:13,376 --> 00:23:15,616
As the Vice Minister,

455
00:23:16,535 --> 00:23:18,935
I can't allow some rumours

456
00:23:19,216 --> 00:23:21,535
to interfere with His Majesty's mind.

457
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:23,734
You are trusted by His Majesty.

458
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:24,774
As long as you are around,

459
00:23:24,775 --> 00:23:26,215
the rumours

460
00:23:26,335 --> 00:23:28,176
will never spread to His Majesty.

461
00:23:28,535 --> 00:23:29,656
There is a chance

462
00:23:30,216 --> 00:23:32,056
for everything to happen.

463
00:23:32,696 --> 00:23:34,856
Do you have any clues

464
00:23:35,015 --> 00:23:36,535
about Chen Jiuheng's remnants?

465
00:23:36,936 --> 00:23:37,935
At the moment...

466
00:23:41,376 --> 00:23:43,376
This shouldn't happen

467
00:23:45,735 --> 00:23:47,376
with your ability, Marquis Lu.

468
00:23:48,535 --> 00:23:50,856
Marquis Lu, don't forget

469
00:23:51,535 --> 00:23:53,495
how much we've sacrificed

470
00:23:54,095 --> 00:23:56,295
to achieve our position today.

471
00:23:56,896 --> 00:23:58,176
I dare not forget.

472
00:23:58,656 --> 00:24:01,136
Don't be too worried.

473
00:24:01,696 --> 00:24:02,975
They are just

474
00:24:02,976 --> 00:24:04,495
biting off more than they can chew.

475
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,539
I dare not

476
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:10,136
ruin the trust His Majesty has in me.

477
00:24:11,456 --> 00:24:14,695
It's time to put an end
to this case now.

478
00:24:18,376 --> 00:24:20,455
Chancellor Wang,
Duke Ying has entered the palace.

479
00:24:23,976 --> 00:24:25,015
He's here.

480
00:24:38,575 --> 00:24:40,096
You are still here?

481
00:24:40,735 --> 00:24:42,895
Duke Ying, you came here in a hurry.

482
00:24:42,896 --> 00:24:44,667
Are you here to see His Majesty

483
00:24:44,668 --> 00:24:46,330
regarding some
important military business?

484
00:24:46,896 --> 00:24:49,735
I do have some military business
to discuss with His Majesty.

485
00:24:51,015 --> 00:24:52,375
It's so late already

486
00:24:52,376 --> 00:24:54,774
yet you are
still on standby in the palace.

487
00:24:54,775 --> 00:24:56,096
You are working hard.

488
00:24:56,376 --> 00:24:57,895
Shouldering His Majesty's burden

489
00:24:57,896 --> 00:24:59,455
is my responsibility.

490
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:01,535
I dare not complain.

491
00:25:01,575 --> 00:25:04,856
You are indeed
the role model of all officials.

492
00:25:07,775 --> 00:25:09,096
Hold it, Duke Ying.

493
00:25:09,775 --> 00:25:12,656
His Majesty just read all the reports

494
00:25:12,751 --> 00:25:15,550
and has been asked by the Consort to have a meal.

495
00:25:15,936 --> 00:25:17,975
If you have something to report,

496
00:25:17,976 --> 00:25:19,735
why don't you hand it over to me?

497
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:21,655
Thanks to His Majesty,

498
00:25:21,656 --> 00:25:24,574
I was asked to stay back
and discuss some matters with him.

499
00:25:24,575 --> 00:25:26,294
I will definitely

500
00:25:26,295 --> 00:25:28,176
help you give it to His Majesty.

501
00:25:32,936 --> 00:25:35,294
I won't trouble you, Vice Minister.

502
00:25:35,295 --> 00:25:36,695
It's nothing serious.

503
00:25:36,696 --> 00:25:38,014
Since His Majesty is busy,

504
00:25:38,015 --> 00:25:41,015
I will report it to him another day.

505
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,615
(Liuhe Tavern)

506
00:26:06,735 --> 00:26:07,655
Duke Ying

507
00:26:07,656 --> 00:26:09,175
left the palace 15 minutes

508
00:26:09,176 --> 00:26:10,294
after he entered.

509
00:26:10,295 --> 00:26:11,816
I'm afraid he didn't meet His Majesty.

510
00:26:14,255 --> 00:26:16,334
Duke Ying suddenly
involves himself in the case.

511
00:26:16,335 --> 00:26:17,774
It is only reasonable

512
00:26:17,775 --> 00:26:19,294
for Wang Yuan to be cautious

513
00:26:19,295 --> 00:26:20,735
and stop him from meeting His Majesty.

514
00:26:21,416 --> 00:26:22,175
Should we

515
00:26:22,176 --> 00:26:23,375
think of something?

516
00:26:23,376 --> 00:26:25,176
There are many ways to fight a war.

517
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:27,539
Duke Ying has been
leading the troops for years.

518
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:28,774
He should have his own methods.

519
00:26:28,775 --> 00:26:30,376
We just need to wait for his news.

520
00:26:31,176 --> 00:26:32,136
Yes.

521
00:26:32,176 --> 00:26:33,175
Oh,

522
00:26:33,176 --> 00:26:34,734
did you find the person I asked you to?

523
00:26:34,735 --> 00:26:35,655
I did.

524
00:26:35,656 --> 00:26:37,415
Young Master Lin wanted to go North

525
00:26:37,416 --> 00:26:39,254
but he met bandits on the way.

526
00:26:39,255 --> 00:26:41,254
Thankfully, our men rescued him.

527
00:26:41,255 --> 00:26:42,254
We found

528
00:26:42,255 --> 00:26:44,175
that he seems to be looking for
a type of spice.

529
00:26:44,176 --> 00:26:45,135
Spice?

530
00:26:45,136 --> 00:26:45,856
Yes.

531
00:26:46,095 --> 00:26:47,855
Later, I asked the staff at the shop

532
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,975
to find a way to sell him some.

533
00:26:49,976 --> 00:26:51,895
Then, we escorted him from the shadows.

534
00:26:51,896 --> 00:26:53,336
He is back in the capital now.

535
00:26:59,535 --> 00:27:00,576
You can't enter.

536
00:27:00,735 --> 00:27:02,574
It's me. See clearly.

537
00:27:02,575 --> 00:27:03,774
Why does he look

538
00:27:03,775 --> 00:27:05,295
like Sixth Master Lin?

539
00:27:05,936 --> 00:27:08,096
He is Sixth Master Lin indeed.

540
00:27:16,055 --> 00:27:16,935
Hairu!

541
00:27:17,335 --> 00:27:18,576
I'm back!

542
00:27:19,055 --> 00:27:19,975
Hairu!

543
00:27:23,896 --> 00:27:25,176
Sixth Master Lin.

544
00:27:32,464 --> 00:27:33,345
Hairu...

545
00:27:33,696 --> 00:27:34,255
You...

546
00:27:35,255 --> 00:27:37,135
Hairu, why did you beat me up
as soon as I came back?

547
00:27:37,136 --> 00:27:39,215
You left without saying a word
and only left a letter.

548
00:27:39,216 --> 00:27:41,255
Don't you know
that everyone is worried about you?

549
00:27:41,416 --> 00:27:42,975
I just went out to take a stroll.

550
00:27:44,176 --> 00:27:45,139
Take a stroll?

551
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,619
How is this taking a stroll?

552
00:27:46,696 --> 00:27:47,975
Do you think I'm blind?

553
00:27:48,055 --> 00:27:50,014
You've obviously been robbed.

554
00:27:50,015 --> 00:27:51,376
I didn't.

555
00:27:51,535 --> 00:27:52,975
I only slipped.

556
00:27:53,376 --> 00:27:55,215
You slipped? Show me.

557
00:27:55,495 --> 00:27:57,254
- I'm fine, Hairu.
- Did you injure yourself?

558
00:27:57,255 --> 00:27:58,334
I'm really fine, Hairu.

559
00:27:58,335 --> 00:27:59,534
Did you injure yourself?

560
00:27:59,535 --> 00:28:00,935
I'm fine.

561
00:28:00,936 --> 00:28:01,855
Sixth Master Lin,

562
00:28:01,856 --> 00:28:03,375
Madam Lin fell ill

563
00:28:03,376 --> 00:28:04,775
because you left suddenly.

564
00:28:06,495 --> 00:28:08,655
Hairu, how do you feel?

565
00:28:08,656 --> 00:28:10,136
What did the physician say?
Let me see.

566
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,540
I'm fine.

567
00:28:13,176 --> 00:28:14,455
Let's talk later.

568
00:28:14,575 --> 00:28:15,616
It's good that you're back.

569
00:28:16,616 --> 00:28:18,136
It's my fault

570
00:28:18,656 --> 00:28:19,816
for making you worried.

571
00:28:22,616 --> 00:28:23,616
I know.

572
00:28:24,136 --> 00:28:25,975
I was too harsh on you

573
00:28:26,335 --> 00:28:29,056
but you couldn't leave as you wish.

574
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:31,890
Are you worried that Mother and Father
would scold you for failing the exam?

575
00:28:32,735 --> 00:28:35,255
Mao, don't be afraid.

576
00:28:35,535 --> 00:28:37,136
We did our best.

577
00:28:37,416 --> 00:28:40,735
Besides, I'll shoulder everything with you.

578
00:28:40,815 --> 00:28:42,136
If you fail this year,

579
00:28:42,216 --> 00:28:43,896
you can still take the exam again.

580
00:28:43,976 --> 00:28:45,375
Hairu.

581
00:28:45,376 --> 00:28:46,254
Rui Xiang.

582
00:28:46,255 --> 00:28:47,735
Why are you still spacing out?

583
00:28:47,896 --> 00:28:49,535
Inform the kitchen

584
00:28:49,656 --> 00:28:51,814
to make a few dishes
for Mao immediately.

585
00:28:51,815 --> 00:28:52,616
Yes.

586
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:53,656
Yes.

587
00:28:56,495 --> 00:28:57,735
You shouldn't stay here any longer.

588
00:28:57,936 --> 00:28:59,576
Go and change your clothes.

589
00:29:00,055 --> 00:29:01,535
You are so dirty.

590
00:29:02,295 --> 00:29:03,295
Go!

591
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:14,033
(Danhua Abode)

592
00:29:36,015 --> 00:29:37,255
Sixth Master Lin?

593
00:29:37,815 --> 00:29:38,695
Lian Hong.

594
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:40,935
You're back?

595
00:29:40,936 --> 00:29:42,535
I must tell Sixth Lady.

596
00:29:43,495 --> 00:29:44,495
What?

597
00:29:44,696 --> 00:29:47,135
Has your young lady been concerned
about whether I've returned or not?

598
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:49,254
Of course. When she heard you were gone,

599
00:29:49,255 --> 00:29:51,534
she wanted to go out to search for you
but I stopped her.

600
00:29:51,535 --> 00:29:52,535
Really?

601
00:29:54,847 --> 00:29:55,847
Was the man

602
00:29:56,416 --> 00:29:57,375
who went out just now

603
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:59,294
a subordinate of Young Master Han?

604
00:29:59,295 --> 00:30:00,135
Yes.

605
00:30:00,136 --> 00:30:02,375
Her Highness sent many things over.

606
00:30:02,376 --> 00:30:04,375
They are all Young Lady's favourite food.

607
00:30:04,376 --> 00:30:05,895
She also sent

608
00:30:05,896 --> 00:30:07,334
many types of spices
that Young Lady likes.

609
00:30:07,335 --> 00:30:09,656
They are expensive and rare.

610
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:11,656
He is really nice.

611
00:30:11,936 --> 00:30:13,375
Young Master Han is very nice.

612
00:30:13,376 --> 00:30:15,455
He always sends things here.

613
00:30:15,456 --> 00:30:17,175
Young Lady is asking me

614
00:30:17,176 --> 00:30:18,735
to bring some to Seventh Lady.

615
00:30:19,735 --> 00:30:20,574
Sixth Master Lin,

616
00:30:20,575 --> 00:30:21,774
did you call me

617
00:30:21,775 --> 00:30:24,056
because you have a message
for Young Lady?

618
00:30:25,575 --> 00:30:26,416
No!

619
00:30:35,535 --> 00:30:36,416
Young Lady.

620
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:38,935
Young Lady.

621
00:30:38,936 --> 00:30:41,775
Sixth Master Lin asked me
to give this to you just now.

622
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,061
Who did you say?

623
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:45,255
Sixth Master Lin.

624
00:30:49,136 --> 00:30:51,136
Young Lady!

625
00:31:19,376 --> 00:31:20,176
Lin Mao!

626
00:31:34,535 --> 00:31:35,735
You are back.

627
00:31:36,815 --> 00:31:38,376
I'm back.

628
00:31:39,216 --> 00:31:39,975
Did you

629
00:31:39,976 --> 00:31:42,015
get Lian Hong to give that to me?

630
00:31:43,976 --> 00:31:44,975
Yes.

631
00:31:44,976 --> 00:31:46,774
Why didn't you give it to me yourself?

632
00:31:46,775 --> 00:31:48,929
I saw Her Highness delivering it to you.

633
00:31:48,930 --> 00:31:50,492
Since Her Highness
already gave it to me,

634
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:51,695
why did you still give it to me?

635
00:31:51,696 --> 00:31:54,169
I went through a lot to get them.

636
00:31:54,170 --> 00:31:56,160
It might not be better
than the ones given by Her Highness

637
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,450
but it is difficult to buy them.

638
00:31:57,936 --> 00:31:59,495
Save it just in case.

639
00:32:00,535 --> 00:32:01,615
How do you know

640
00:32:01,616 --> 00:32:03,655
Her Highness ones' would be better?

641
00:32:03,656 --> 00:32:05,376
She got them from the palace.

642
00:32:05,416 --> 00:32:06,734
Of course, they are the best.

643
00:32:06,735 --> 00:32:08,056
That's not necessary.

644
00:32:08,976 --> 00:32:12,215
I went to meet Her Highness
with Mother previously.

645
00:32:12,456 --> 00:32:13,175
I thought the food

646
00:32:13,176 --> 00:32:15,056
wasn't as delicious as Liuhe Tavern's.

647
00:32:22,176 --> 00:32:23,136
Then...

648
00:32:25,335 --> 00:32:26,695
What about the thing I gave you?

649
00:32:35,656 --> 00:32:36,656
It's not bad.

650
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:39,380
It was slightly better
than Her Highness'.

651
00:32:40,976 --> 00:32:42,495
That's worth it then.

652
00:32:47,456 --> 00:32:48,455
Yixiu.

653
00:32:50,216 --> 00:32:51,975
Can you stop being angry at me?

654
00:32:54,535 --> 00:32:55,855
I hid

655
00:32:55,856 --> 00:32:57,254
the best lamb meat in secret.

656
00:32:57,255 --> 00:32:58,576
I'll roast it for you later.

657
00:33:01,976 --> 00:33:03,416
I suddenly remember

658
00:33:03,535 --> 00:33:04,975
Hairu prepared a meal for me.

659
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:06,576
I must return and eat.

660
00:33:08,976 --> 00:33:09,816
Next time.

661
00:33:10,416 --> 00:33:11,935
Next time, we'll eat it in secret then.

662
00:33:13,015 --> 00:33:15,255
Sure. We'll eat it in secret next time.

663
00:33:16,255 --> 00:33:17,014
Go back.

664
00:33:17,015 --> 00:33:19,096
Go back. I'm leaving then.

665
00:33:35,616 --> 00:33:37,136
Eat slowly.

666
00:33:39,416 --> 00:33:41,015
You said you went to the North?

667
00:33:41,456 --> 00:33:42,576
The north is a mess.

668
00:33:42,896 --> 00:33:44,096
Did you have a death wish?

669
00:33:44,295 --> 00:33:46,015
I just wanted to take a look.

670
00:33:46,095 --> 00:33:48,089
Anyway, isn't it great that I'm fine?

671
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:49,468
Do you want something to happen to you?

672
00:33:50,896 --> 00:33:52,816
You are the only son of the Lin family.

673
00:33:52,936 --> 00:33:53,774
Failing the exam

674
00:33:53,775 --> 00:33:54,975
isn't serious.

675
00:33:54,976 --> 00:33:55,975
If something happens to you,

676
00:33:55,976 --> 00:33:57,376
it'll be serious.

677
00:34:00,376 --> 00:34:01,376
Hairu,

678
00:34:02,295 --> 00:34:04,176
I will not take the examination again.

679
00:34:04,255 --> 00:34:04,695
You...

680
00:34:15,376 --> 00:34:17,976
Mao, it's all right.

681
00:34:18,296 --> 00:34:19,455
You don't need to feel dejected

682
00:34:19,456 --> 00:34:20,815
after failing the examination once.

683
00:34:22,055 --> 00:34:24,375
Didn't Luo Shanyuan

684
00:34:24,376 --> 00:34:26,176
fail as well?

685
00:34:26,776 --> 00:34:28,174
With your intellect,

686
00:34:28,175 --> 00:34:29,215
it'll only take three years.

687
00:34:29,376 --> 00:34:31,616
You will succeed after three years.

688
00:34:33,416 --> 00:34:34,415
Hairu,

689
00:34:34,495 --> 00:34:35,855
take a good look at me.

690
00:34:35,856 --> 00:34:38,616
Do you think I can succeed in ten years
let alone in three years?

691
00:34:40,776 --> 00:34:41,775
Am I going

692
00:34:41,776 --> 00:34:44,056
to waste my life
on something I don't like?

693
00:34:45,256 --> 00:34:47,054
I don't have many opportunities in life.

694
00:34:47,055 --> 00:34:48,976
Am I going to waste them
on the examinations?

695
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:55,735
I went North

696
00:34:56,376 --> 00:34:58,295
and saw many pitiful scenes.

697
00:34:59,575 --> 00:35:01,496
I almost end up dead as well.

698
00:35:03,495 --> 00:35:05,056
So, I thought

699
00:35:05,376 --> 00:35:07,936
I should do something
that I'm really interested in

700
00:35:07,976 --> 00:35:09,735
instead of wasting time being trapped

701
00:35:09,736 --> 00:35:10,855
in our family stereotype.

702
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:13,320
What about our parents' expectations
and the revival of the Lin family?

703
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,400
The Lin family's business
has spread all over Jiangnan.

704
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,576
It is already a prosperous business.

705
00:35:16,936 --> 00:35:17,975
The revival

706
00:35:17,976 --> 00:35:19,455
is just a kind
of ridiculous self-abasement

707
00:35:19,456 --> 00:35:20,976
in our hearts.

708
00:35:24,615 --> 00:35:25,455
Our ancestors

709
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:27,375
made a living with their own hands.

710
00:35:27,575 --> 00:35:29,255
How are they worse than others?

711
00:35:33,376 --> 00:35:35,176
I will never take the examination again.

712
00:35:35,256 --> 00:35:37,255
Mother and Father
can beat me up as much as I want.

713
00:35:37,256 --> 00:35:39,176
I don't mind even if they chase me
out of the Lin family.

714
00:35:40,175 --> 00:35:41,136
I know.

715
00:35:41,495 --> 00:35:42,976
I've always made you worry

716
00:35:43,095 --> 00:35:44,855
as your younger brother

717
00:35:45,736 --> 00:35:47,054
but I will use my own way

718
00:35:47,055 --> 00:35:48,496
to make you feel proud of me.

719
00:35:57,831 --> 00:35:59,815
(Caifu Abode)

720
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:08,167
(Success in academics)

721
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:21,536
Here. I'm giving you
the best piece of meat.

722
00:36:22,095 --> 00:36:24,056
It has been a long time
since we've gathered.

723
00:36:24,296 --> 00:36:26,056
We haven't gathered
for a long time indeed.

724
00:36:27,256 --> 00:36:28,975
Why are you looking at me like this?

725
00:36:28,976 --> 00:36:30,255
Do you feel so touched?

726
00:36:30,736 --> 00:36:32,935
I must treat my younger sister well.

727
00:36:32,936 --> 00:36:34,496
Here. I'll give you another piece.

728
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:35,356
Here you go.

729
00:36:37,296 --> 00:36:38,295
Sixth Sister.

730
00:36:38,736 --> 00:36:40,576
No matter what happens,

731
00:36:40,655 --> 00:36:42,695
you will always be
the best sister I have.

732
00:36:45,655 --> 00:36:46,975
Shenyuan,

733
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:48,375
I haven't given you a toast

734
00:36:48,376 --> 00:36:50,096
since you became the provincial scholar.

735
00:36:51,135 --> 00:36:52,295
You are really good

736
00:36:52,296 --> 00:36:54,335
at hiding your talents

737
00:36:54,336 --> 00:36:56,174
and being humble.

738
00:36:56,175 --> 00:36:57,255
Thank you, Uncle.

739
00:36:59,135 --> 00:37:01,614
Your literary talent is best

740
00:37:01,615 --> 00:37:02,735
when you are not taking an exam.

741
00:37:05,816 --> 00:37:07,375
I told Hairu honestly.

742
00:37:07,936 --> 00:37:09,735
I will never take an exam again
in the future.

743
00:37:11,095 --> 00:37:12,936
Didn't she beat you up?

744
00:37:13,095 --> 00:37:14,775
Perhaps she couldn't react.

745
00:37:15,896 --> 00:37:16,936
Do you know

746
00:37:16,976 --> 00:37:17,735
what I saw

747
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:19,096
along the way?

748
00:37:22,135 --> 00:37:23,136
I saw

749
00:37:23,695 --> 00:37:25,056
the wilted crops

750
00:37:25,256 --> 00:37:27,136
and cracked farmlands.

751
00:37:27,816 --> 00:37:29,215
People who could escape

752
00:37:29,256 --> 00:37:30,975
had already escaped
before the war reached them.

753
00:37:30,976 --> 00:37:32,335
Those who couldn't escape

754
00:37:32,695 --> 00:37:34,375
were so skinny from being starved.

755
00:37:35,615 --> 00:37:37,255
I wanted to buy some food for them

756
00:37:37,655 --> 00:37:38,335
but you couldn't

757
00:37:38,336 --> 00:37:39,895
even buy a bag of wheat there.

758
00:37:45,535 --> 00:37:47,176
Uncle, you've seen a lot

759
00:37:47,695 --> 00:37:48,976
after leaving this time.

760
00:37:50,376 --> 00:37:52,094
Did you tell Mother

761
00:37:52,095 --> 00:37:54,335
that you won't take an examination again
because of this?

762
00:37:54,495 --> 00:37:56,694
- What are you planning to do?
- Business.

763
00:37:56,695 --> 00:37:58,775
The bigger the business, the better.

764
00:37:59,095 --> 00:37:59,895
Yining,

765
00:37:59,896 --> 00:38:02,415
we can expand the business
to the north and the south.

766
00:38:02,456 --> 00:38:03,494
Anywhere we go,

767
00:38:03,495 --> 00:38:04,815
if we see people in need of help,

768
00:38:04,816 --> 00:38:06,614
we will help them.

769
00:38:06,615 --> 00:38:08,174
If there's a place that needs help,

770
00:38:08,175 --> 00:38:09,616
we can do our part.

771
00:38:11,336 --> 00:38:12,456
If I waste my time

772
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:14,915
on examinations
because of my parents' expectations

773
00:38:14,916 --> 00:38:16,090
in my life,

774
00:38:16,736 --> 00:38:18,096
I won't be able to help myself

775
00:38:18,215 --> 00:38:19,456
and others.

776
00:38:29,456 --> 00:38:30,616
Uncle, thank you

777
00:38:31,376 --> 00:38:32,735
for being benevolent

778
00:38:32,856 --> 00:38:34,255
and thinking about the people.

779
00:38:48,575 --> 00:38:50,536
I was probably boasting again.

780
00:38:52,055 --> 00:38:53,215
It is not that easy

781
00:38:53,936 --> 00:38:55,255
to make it a reality.

782
00:38:55,655 --> 00:38:56,976
You can't walk a thousand miles

783
00:38:57,336 --> 00:38:58,735
before taking small steps.

784
00:38:58,736 --> 00:38:59,935
An ocean doesn't form

785
00:38:59,936 --> 00:39:01,375
without small streams.

786
00:39:01,535 --> 00:39:03,534
Since you've thought about this,

787
00:39:03,535 --> 00:39:05,335
you've already taken the first step.

788
00:39:05,336 --> 00:39:07,976
Sixth Uncle
didn't just take the first step.

789
00:39:08,655 --> 00:39:10,735
Isn't your shop almost done?

790
00:39:13,575 --> 00:39:16,375
Can I ask you for a favour?

791
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:21,605
(Caifu Abode)

792
00:39:29,175 --> 00:39:30,375
Did the three of you

793
00:39:30,376 --> 00:39:33,056
agree to persuade me together?

794
00:39:44,135 --> 00:39:45,136
Mother.

795
00:39:47,095 --> 00:39:48,214
Sixth Uncle said

796
00:39:48,215 --> 00:39:50,056
he wasn't cut out for this.

797
00:39:53,456 --> 00:39:54,855
Then, what is my brother

798
00:39:54,976 --> 00:39:56,616
cut out for?

799
00:39:58,575 --> 00:40:01,656
Since young, he has been a fast learner.

800
00:40:01,976 --> 00:40:04,375
Everyone praised him
for being smart when they saw him.

801
00:40:04,376 --> 00:40:05,855
So, my parents

802
00:40:05,896 --> 00:40:07,735
also have high hopes for him.

803
00:40:07,776 --> 00:40:09,935
They even expect him
to change the Lin family's status

804
00:40:09,936 --> 00:40:11,576
away from being a merchant.

805
00:40:16,015 --> 00:40:17,016
Mother.

806
00:40:18,336 --> 00:40:20,215
I must say something about this.

807
00:40:20,256 --> 00:40:22,656
Merchants being the worst
is just a secular stereotype.

808
00:40:22,776 --> 00:40:24,616
The imperial court issued an order

809
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:26,419
to manage the finances
before political affairs.

810
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:29,290
Merchants are obviously important.

811
00:40:33,535 --> 00:40:34,815
Isn't it wonderful

812
00:40:34,976 --> 00:40:36,695
if everyone

813
00:40:36,736 --> 00:40:38,096
shares your opinion?

814
00:40:39,695 --> 00:40:40,695
Mother,

815
00:40:40,776 --> 00:40:42,094
Sixth Uncle and I

816
00:40:42,095 --> 00:40:43,775
are going to open a rouge shop.

817
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:45,815
Sixth Uncle is good at making rouge.

818
00:40:46,615 --> 00:40:48,534
When we open the shop,

819
00:40:48,535 --> 00:40:50,455
it will surely become popular
all over the capital.

820
00:40:50,456 --> 00:40:51,255
Is that so?

821
00:40:51,256 --> 00:40:52,654
We will also expand south

822
00:40:52,655 --> 00:40:53,936
all the way to Lin'an.

823
00:40:55,856 --> 00:40:56,935
A man

824
00:40:56,936 --> 00:40:58,975
making something used by women.

825
00:40:58,976 --> 00:41:00,209
Don't you find it embarrassing?

826
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:03,375
The Lin family has been selling silks, satins,
hair sticks and jewellery for generations

827
00:41:03,376 --> 00:41:04,775
but you are fine with it.

828
00:41:05,416 --> 00:41:05,815
You...

829
00:41:13,936 --> 00:41:14,815
Medicine.

830
00:41:15,215 --> 00:41:16,574
The medicine you used

831
00:41:16,575 --> 00:41:18,375
was made by Uncle.

832
00:41:20,456 --> 00:41:21,456
That?

833
00:41:22,856 --> 00:41:24,016
That was good indeed.

834
00:41:24,896 --> 00:41:27,695
The normal ones
couldn't even compare to it.

835
00:41:28,535 --> 00:41:30,936
Sixth Uncle,
do you even know how to make medicine?

836
00:41:30,976 --> 00:41:33,054
You are so amazing.

837
00:41:33,055 --> 00:41:35,295
Indeed. Uncle's skill in this

838
00:41:35,296 --> 00:41:38,040
is no worse than the medicinal families.

839
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,243
He is skillful and has a kind heart.

840
00:41:39,244 --> 00:41:40,054
With this skill,

841
00:41:40,055 --> 00:41:42,536
he can save many people.

842
00:41:42,736 --> 00:41:44,054
I think we shouldn't

843
00:41:44,055 --> 00:41:47,016
judge him with his studies
and the imperial examination.

844
00:41:47,055 --> 00:41:48,176
That's unfair to his talents.

845
00:41:53,615 --> 00:41:55,176
In your opinion,

846
00:41:55,376 --> 00:41:56,616
my younger brother

847
00:41:56,736 --> 00:41:58,576
is a talent indeed.

848
00:42:01,535 --> 00:42:03,335
However, he has never done any business.

849
00:42:03,376 --> 00:42:04,299
What if...

850
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,500
Hairu, don't worry.

851
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,109
The Lin family
has been merchants for generations.

852
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:07,956
I have naturally

853
00:42:07,976 --> 00:42:09,694
inherited some of the talent.

854
00:42:09,695 --> 00:42:10,975
However, when it comes to talent,

855
00:42:10,976 --> 00:42:12,975
I'm sure you are better, right?

856
00:42:12,976 --> 00:42:14,054
Naturally.

857
00:42:14,055 --> 00:42:16,094
If Mother hasn't been bound
within the residence,

858
00:42:16,095 --> 00:42:16,975
no one can compare to her

859
00:42:16,976 --> 00:42:18,775
if she runs a business out there.

860
00:42:19,776 --> 00:42:20,936
Right, Third Brother?

861
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,179
Yes. I... Right.

862
00:42:24,256 --> 00:42:26,014
If you open the store in the future,

863
00:42:26,015 --> 00:42:27,295
you must learn

864
00:42:27,296 --> 00:42:28,496
from Mother.

865
00:42:31,416 --> 00:42:33,975
I know what all of you are thinking.

866
00:42:33,976 --> 00:42:35,576
Don't try to flatter me.

867
00:42:35,609 --> 00:42:37,099
This isn't flattery.

868
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:38,740
Mother is the best.

869
00:42:38,816 --> 00:42:40,136
Right, Third Brother?

870
00:42:40,575 --> 00:42:42,176
Yes. Indeed.

871
00:42:50,175 --> 00:42:51,775
Mother is very great.

872
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,640
Don't flatter me.

873
00:42:55,175 --> 00:42:56,335
Second Master is here.

874
00:42:57,535 --> 00:42:58,735
Second Master is here?

875
00:43:00,655 --> 00:43:02,096
Are you looking for me?

876
00:43:04,416 --> 00:43:06,576
I am just passing by.

877
00:43:07,015 --> 00:43:08,136
Get back to work then.

878
00:43:08,695 --> 00:43:09,936
I haven't eaten yet.

879
00:43:10,736 --> 00:43:11,695
You haven't eaten yet?

880
00:43:13,776 --> 00:43:14,614
I'll ask the servants

881
00:43:14,615 --> 00:43:16,456
to send food to your study.

882
00:43:18,736 --> 00:43:20,016
