(Adapted from Wen Tan's novel "Chancellor
Training Handbook" from Jinjiang Literature)

00:01:36,658 --> 00:01:38,978
=Episode 21=

4
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,064
(Zuixian Restaurant)

5
00:01:50,829 --> 00:01:52,029
What is this?

6
00:01:59,861 --> 00:02:01,907
(Dengwen Drum Court)

7
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:36,670
This must be Chen Jiuheng's
principal disciple.

8
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:37,430
Right.

9
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,080
Back then, Chen Jiuheng

10
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,400
embezzled the disaster relief funds

11
00:02:41,408 --> 00:02:42,300
and caused many deaths.

12
00:02:42,469 --> 00:02:44,069
He's indeed shameless
to demand justice.

13
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:45,710
Words have spread everywhere,

14
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:47,620
claiming that Chen Jiuheng
didn't commit corruption.

15
00:02:47,629 --> 00:02:48,950
Someone else did.

16
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,189
He was framed by the mastermind
and died unjustly.

17
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:52,499
Seriously?

18
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,856
If that's true,

19
00:02:53,888 --> 00:02:56,170
the imperial court wouldn't have
left him kneeling for days

20
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,408
without giving any response.

21
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,340
You didn't know that yet.

22
00:02:58,384 --> 00:03:00,465
No one knows the truth

23
00:03:00,465 --> 00:03:01,264
of this case.

24
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:03,305
Anyway, this is none of our business.

25
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:12,824
These days,

26
00:03:12,824 --> 00:03:14,145
many people are gathering there,

27
00:03:14,224 --> 00:03:15,865
but no one has approached Chen Daoyan.

28
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,380
He's trying to use the public sentiment
to alert His Majesty

29
00:03:19,585 --> 00:03:20,784
to reopen an old case.

30
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:21,824
That's a brilliant move.

31
00:03:23,504 --> 00:03:24,305
Uncle,

32
00:03:25,345 --> 00:03:27,345
everyone in the capital is
discussing this matter.

33
00:03:27,704 --> 00:03:28,745
If this goes on,

34
00:03:28,984 --> 00:03:31,104
I'm afraid this may catch
His Majesty's attention.

35
00:03:32,752 --> 00:03:33,968
We can't wait any longer.

36
00:03:34,504 --> 00:03:35,585
Take action tonight.

37
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:38,224
- Yes.
- Yes.

38
00:05:04,034 --> 00:05:04,834
Useless fools!

39
00:05:05,824 --> 00:05:07,504
I sent you to kill Chen Daoyan.

40
00:05:07,584 --> 00:05:09,144
You brought a group of people there,

41
00:05:09,185 --> 00:05:10,704
and yet he's still alive now.

42
00:05:10,928 --> 00:05:12,208
Please calm down, Your Lordship.

43
00:05:12,305 --> 00:05:13,745
Someone is protecting Chen Daoyan.

44
00:05:13,745 --> 00:05:15,865
That means his accomplices
are nearby.

45
00:05:15,904 --> 00:05:16,944
They are nearby?

46
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,721
Did you capture any of them?

47
00:05:19,952 --> 00:05:21,472
Please pardon my incompetence.

48
00:05:25,654 --> 00:05:26,453
Now,

49
00:05:26,824 --> 00:05:27,824
send more people.

50
00:05:28,016 --> 00:05:29,340
If you still can't take him down,

51
00:05:29,785 --> 00:05:31,024
I'm coming for you next.

52
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:34,425
Yes, Your Lordship.

53
00:05:39,425 --> 00:05:41,185
Your Lordship, Vice Minister Li is here.

54
00:05:43,425 --> 00:05:44,179
Bring him in.

55
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,088
Yes, Your Lordship.

56
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:53,904
Your Lordship.

57
00:05:53,904 --> 00:05:54,704
Vice Minister Li.

58
00:05:55,425 --> 00:05:56,185
Please have a seat.

59
00:05:56,185 --> 00:05:57,024
No need.

60
00:05:57,344 --> 00:05:58,584
I came here to convey a message.

61
00:05:58,584 --> 00:05:59,625
I'll be leaving right after.

62
00:05:59,632 --> 00:06:00,912
Executive Vice Minister Wang said

63
00:06:00,976 --> 00:06:02,180
this matter

64
00:06:02,225 --> 00:06:04,425
has spread throughout
the entire capital,

65
00:06:04,504 --> 00:06:06,185
and His Majesty has already
learned about it.

66
00:06:06,185 --> 00:06:07,099
His Majesty then summoned

67
00:06:07,099 --> 00:06:09,580
Minister of Imperial Court of Judicial
and the Grand Chancellor late at night.

68
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,620
It was decided to reexamine the case.

69
00:06:16,944 --> 00:06:18,785
What's Grand Chancellor Wang's plan?

70
00:06:20,944 --> 00:06:22,384
His Majesty has appointed

71
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:25,185
Executive Vice Minister Wang
to preside over this case.

72
00:06:27,344 --> 00:06:28,384
That's great.

73
00:06:28,425 --> 00:06:30,024
According to Executive
Vice Minister Wang,

74
00:06:30,225 --> 00:06:31,859
since Chen Daoyan dares

75
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,168
to air his grievances in public,

76
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,740
there must be more
than meets the eyes.

77
00:06:34,785 --> 00:06:37,425
He hopes for your assistance.

78
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,020
Grand Chancellor Wang may rest assured.

79
00:06:39,824 --> 00:06:41,785
I will do my utmost.

80
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,535
(Demand justice for an old case)

81
00:07:00,185 --> 00:07:01,344
His Majesty issued a decree.

82
00:07:01,584 --> 00:07:02,785
Chen Jiuheng's case

83
00:07:02,785 --> 00:07:04,024
involves many parties,

84
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,568
and all the people pay attention to it.

85
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,136
Therefore, the case will be reopened.

86
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:10,016
Wang Yuan, the Executive Vice Minister
of Chancellery, will be the judge.

87
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:12,024
Take him inside.

88
00:07:12,024 --> 00:07:13,065
Yes.

89
00:07:49,504 --> 00:07:50,904
Chen Daoyan,

90
00:07:51,425 --> 00:07:52,904
I remember you.

91
00:07:53,225 --> 00:07:55,625
You're Chen Jiuheng's
principal disciple.

92
00:07:56,105 --> 00:07:57,785
What a backbone you have.

93
00:07:58,264 --> 00:07:59,504
You've been living on the run

94
00:08:00,305 --> 00:08:02,105
as a fugitive for years.

95
00:08:03,305 --> 00:08:06,105
Yet, you have the audacity
to demand justice.

96
00:08:09,185 --> 00:08:10,625
My master and I

97
00:08:11,264 --> 00:08:13,065
were framed by treacherous people

98
00:08:13,088 --> 00:08:15,328
and have lived under false accusation
for years.

99
00:08:15,392 --> 00:08:16,700
I hope justice will be served.

100
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:17,904
Nonsense!

101
00:08:17,904 --> 00:08:20,100
The witness and evidence
of Chen Jiuheng's

102
00:08:20,105 --> 00:08:21,625
relief funds embezzlement
were conclusive

103
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:23,419
and reviewed and finalized
by His Majesty.

104
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,000
How can you claim
it's a false accusation?

105
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,199
The witness made false accusations,

106
00:08:27,579 --> 00:08:29,699
and the evidence was fabricated.

107
00:08:31,504 --> 00:08:33,265
My master never
took a single piece of silver

108
00:08:33,265 --> 00:08:34,584
from the official funds.

109
00:08:34,584 --> 00:08:35,265
You!

110
00:08:39,624 --> 00:08:40,824
Chen Daoyan,

111
00:08:41,425 --> 00:08:42,704
you claim you're falsely accused.

112
00:08:43,265 --> 00:08:44,704
Can you prove it?

113
00:09:02,104 --> 00:09:04,025
"Chen Jiuheng's case was closed.

114
00:09:04,385 --> 00:09:05,905
Even though the witness has died,

115
00:09:05,905 --> 00:09:07,704
the statement has disappeared

116
00:09:07,785 --> 00:09:09,984
and must be found

117
00:09:10,385 --> 00:09:13,505
to prevent further trouble."

118
00:09:19,185 --> 00:09:21,025
Is this written by Song Yingshan?

119
00:09:24,505 --> 00:09:26,984
But he's already dead.

120
00:09:27,464 --> 00:09:29,824
The content is ambiguous.

121
00:09:29,905 --> 00:09:31,385
There's no specification.

122
00:09:31,624 --> 00:09:33,145
It can't prove

123
00:09:33,185 --> 00:09:34,864
that Chen Jiuheng was falsely accused.

124
00:09:35,265 --> 00:09:36,824
Trying to reopen the case

125
00:09:37,704 --> 00:09:39,104
with this mere letter?

126
00:09:41,265 --> 00:09:42,864
I have other evidence,

127
00:09:43,704 --> 00:09:45,584
but I will only present it
to His Majesty.

128
00:09:47,104 --> 00:09:47,864
You...

129
00:09:48,984 --> 00:09:50,905
You want to seek an audience
with His Majesty?

130
00:09:53,704 --> 00:09:55,824
You're a criminal.

131
00:09:56,425 --> 00:09:58,025
It's a great mercy from His Majesty

132
00:09:59,104 --> 00:10:01,265
to reopen the case.

133
00:10:02,065 --> 00:10:04,265
You'd better present the evidence now.

134
00:10:04,464 --> 00:10:06,744
Otherwise, not only
will the verdict remain,

135
00:10:06,785 --> 00:10:08,584
but you'll also face
even heavier charges.

136
00:10:13,152 --> 00:10:15,504
I've never thought of leaving
this place alive

137
00:10:16,624 --> 00:10:18,704
after entering
the Dengwen Drum Court.

138
00:10:19,104 --> 00:10:21,104
If you don't allow me
to seek an audience,

139
00:10:21,584 --> 00:10:22,385
someone else will

140
00:10:22,984 --> 00:10:24,545
present the evidence to His Majesty

141
00:10:24,584 --> 00:10:26,065
in the future.

142
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,320
He can't provide enough evidence.

143
00:10:31,065 --> 00:10:32,385
He will be taken into custody

144
00:10:32,905 --> 00:10:34,265
for another trial.

145
00:10:52,905 --> 00:10:56,265
An old case of wrongful accusation.

146
00:11:00,265 --> 00:11:01,065
Lu Jiaxue used to

147
00:11:01,065 --> 00:11:02,505
rely on Song Yingshan,

148
00:11:02,984 --> 00:11:03,859
but then he took over

149
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:04,960
the status of the Song Family

150
00:11:05,008 --> 00:11:06,220
by completely eliminating them.

151
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:08,385
This man alone is big trouble,

152
00:11:09,104 --> 00:11:10,584
and now we're confronting Wang Yuan.

153
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,320
The mastermind becomes
the main judge of the case.

154
00:11:13,505 --> 00:11:14,704
This is simply absurd.

155
00:11:15,385 --> 00:11:17,305
What should we do now?

156
00:11:20,505 --> 00:11:21,905
Honestly, I was worried

157
00:11:22,785 --> 00:11:25,305
Wang Yuan might preside over this case.

158
00:11:25,905 --> 00:11:26,704
Shenyuan,

159
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:28,929
have you come up with a plan?

160
00:11:31,296 --> 00:11:33,664
Wang Yuan has been appointed
to preside over this case.

161
00:11:34,665 --> 00:11:36,624
He certainly wouldn't overturn it.

162
00:11:37,665 --> 00:11:39,824
If we could find someone

163
00:11:40,265 --> 00:11:42,385
who is highly revered, powerful,

164
00:11:43,224 --> 00:11:45,185
and has conflicting interests
with Wang Yuan

165
00:11:45,785 --> 00:11:47,344
who's able to confront him

166
00:11:47,344 --> 00:11:48,505
to become a co-judge,

167
00:11:49,488 --> 00:11:50,768
perhaps we'd have a chance.

168
00:11:51,224 --> 00:11:53,305
Wang Yuan is powerful and influential,

169
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,456
who else in the imperial court
could match him?

170
00:11:58,624 --> 00:12:00,265
What's the tea tax for?

171
00:12:01,824 --> 00:12:02,704
To buy horses.

172
00:12:03,104 --> 00:12:04,505
And why are horses needed?

173
00:12:05,065 --> 00:12:05,905
To fight wars.

174
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,600
(Jimo House)

175
00:12:11,624 --> 00:12:13,824
You want to use Duke Ying
against Wang Yuan?

176
00:12:15,584 --> 00:12:16,824
Duke Ying is upright and loyal.

177
00:12:16,824 --> 00:12:18,019
He's also a great general

178
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,600
and has won many battles
all these years,

179
00:12:19,648 --> 00:12:21,136
which makes him valued
by His Majesty.

180
00:12:21,248 --> 00:12:23,104
Furthermore, before Lu Jiaxue
received his title,

181
00:12:23,265 --> 00:12:24,785
his elder brother sabotaged him.

182
00:12:25,065 --> 00:12:26,425
Duke Ying couldn't tolerate it

183
00:12:26,425 --> 00:12:27,665
and once helped him.

184
00:12:27,704 --> 00:12:29,624
After Lu Jiaxue was promoted
to a marquis

185
00:12:29,664 --> 00:12:31,056
and gained power after that battle,

186
00:12:31,104 --> 00:12:32,700
he wouldn't care about others,

187
00:12:32,704 --> 00:12:33,824
but he has always remembered

188
00:12:34,104 --> 00:12:35,224
the kindness Duke Ying

189
00:12:35,224 --> 00:12:36,624
extended to him before.

190
00:12:37,584 --> 00:12:38,385
So,

191
00:12:38,905 --> 00:12:40,704
if we use Duke Ying against Wang Yuan,

192
00:12:41,425 --> 00:12:43,905
Lu Jiaxue won't be too harsh on us,

193
00:12:44,025 --> 00:12:45,505
At least he'll show some restraint.

194
00:12:46,624 --> 00:12:48,065
What's your plan?

195
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,060
I shall offer what Duke Ying needs

196
00:12:50,185 --> 00:12:51,185
and lure him in.

197
00:12:58,066 --> 00:13:02,073
(Duke Ying's Residence)

198
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,000
(Wei Ling, Duke Ying)

199
00:13:14,185 --> 00:13:15,344
This old geezer!

200
00:13:21,065 --> 00:13:21,905
How was it?

201
00:13:22,081 --> 00:13:23,081
(Zhiqi Hall)

202
00:13:24,224 --> 00:13:24,785
Your Lordship.

203
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,500
Are the provisions still sufficient?

204
00:13:26,665 --> 00:13:28,960
Yes, but we're running short
on medical supplies.

205
00:13:29,072 --> 00:13:30,700
We've reported it
to the court for some days.

206
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,952
still, there are no supplies.

207
00:13:33,224 --> 00:13:34,905
Military supplies procurement

208
00:13:35,161 --> 00:13:37,122
have always been
under Wang Yuan's charge.

209
00:13:37,425 --> 00:13:38,464
Without his permission,

210
00:13:38,505 --> 00:13:39,864
no supplies will be given.

211
00:13:39,905 --> 00:13:41,505
I've already made several reports

212
00:13:41,505 --> 00:13:42,704
to His Majesty on this matter.

213
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,704
However, this old geezer is cunning.

214
00:13:44,704 --> 00:13:46,464
He always finds excuses to delay.

215
00:13:46,665 --> 00:13:48,464
The situation at the borders
is worsening,

216
00:13:48,624 --> 00:13:49,824
there are many wounded soldiers.

217
00:13:50,224 --> 00:13:52,185
If we can't get any medicines soon

218
00:13:52,305 --> 00:13:53,704
and the cold disease spreads,

219
00:13:53,744 --> 00:13:55,648
I'm afraid they won't be able
to hold on any longer.

220
00:13:55,665 --> 00:13:56,864
I'll go find him now.

221
00:14:01,185 --> 00:14:02,059
Your Lordship,

222
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,984
someone delivered ten carriages
of medicine outside.

223
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:04,800
And this.

224
00:14:04,905 --> 00:14:06,464
They asked for you to review.

225
00:14:06,704 --> 00:14:07,505
Medicine?

226
00:14:08,065 --> 00:14:09,023
Who sent this?

227
00:14:09,024 --> 00:14:11,264
The person who delivered the medicine
said someone hired them,

228
00:14:11,265 --> 00:14:13,464
so they didn't know
the sender's identity.

229
00:14:13,464 --> 00:14:14,224
You may go.

230
00:14:14,505 --> 00:14:15,265
Yes.

231
00:14:17,475 --> 00:14:18,905
Be careful, Your Lordship.

232
00:14:18,905 --> 00:14:19,704
It may be a trap.

233
00:14:20,065 --> 00:14:21,505
This person gave me what I need now,

234
00:14:21,505 --> 00:14:22,944
naturally, they have a favor to ask.

235
00:14:22,984 --> 00:14:23,905
This is no trap.

236
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,183
(Tea Ledger Volume One)

237
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,285
(Tea Ledger Volume One)

238
00:14:49,984 --> 00:14:50,905
This is a report

239
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:53,505
on tea production and its tax revenue

240
00:14:53,704 --> 00:14:55,425
from ten years ago.

241
00:14:55,704 --> 00:14:57,265
Why did they give me these?

242
00:15:03,305 --> 00:15:04,984
Chen Jiuheng reported

243
00:15:05,904 --> 00:15:08,020
that the tea taxes had been decreasing
year after year

244
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,584
and requested a thorough investigation.

245
00:15:10,505 --> 00:15:11,419
Chen Jiuheng?

246
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,900
He was the Vice Minister of Revenue
whose entire clan was eliminated

247
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,120
due to the embezzlement
of disaster relief funds back then.

248
00:15:16,265 --> 00:15:18,584
Why did they send these ledgers here?

249
00:15:18,592 --> 00:15:20,380
Though tea production
increased significantly,

250
00:15:20,384 --> 00:15:22,240
the tea taxes had been decreasing
year after year.

251
00:15:22,905 --> 00:15:24,385
They're trying to tell us

252
00:15:24,665 --> 00:15:26,305
someone's lining their pockets.

253
00:15:26,574 --> 00:15:27,505
This is ridiculous!

254
00:15:27,505 --> 00:15:29,425
Did someone really embezzle
the tea tax revenue?

255
00:15:29,905 --> 00:15:30,624
The tea tax

256
00:15:30,624 --> 00:15:32,385
is the main source
of military provision.

257
00:15:33,864 --> 00:15:35,785
How dare they get their hands on that.

258
00:15:36,104 --> 00:15:37,704
We risk our lives on the battleground,

259
00:15:37,712 --> 00:15:40,160
and these corrupt officials are
actually profiting for themselves.

260
00:15:40,224 --> 00:15:41,265
This is truly infuriating.

261
00:15:42,065 --> 00:15:44,065
Chen Jiuheng's case

262
00:15:44,065 --> 00:15:45,704
caused quite a stir back then

263
00:15:46,185 --> 00:15:47,385
as it involved many parties.

264
00:15:47,744 --> 00:15:48,545
However,

265
00:15:50,065 --> 00:15:52,104
Chen Jiuheng, who requested
to investigate corruption,

266
00:15:52,265 --> 00:15:53,344
ended up imprisoned

267
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:55,824
for the embezzlement
of disaster relief funds.

268
00:15:56,464 --> 00:15:57,265
It seems

269
00:15:57,905 --> 00:15:59,665
there's more to the story.

270
00:16:00,185 --> 00:16:01,665
His principal disciple

271
00:16:01,665 --> 00:16:04,065
suddenly appeared
and demanded justice for him.

272
00:16:04,425 --> 00:16:06,025
Do these things

273
00:16:06,025 --> 00:16:07,464
have something to do with that?

274
00:16:10,584 --> 00:16:11,905
If this is truly a wrongful case

275
00:16:11,952 --> 00:16:13,500
and it's related to military provision,

276
00:16:13,584 --> 00:16:15,464
I must step in and do something.

277
00:16:15,704 --> 00:16:17,464
Let's go and check on the medicine.

278
00:16:17,464 --> 00:16:18,104
Yes.

279
00:16:27,905 --> 00:16:29,984
That must be Duke Ying.

280
00:16:30,984 --> 00:16:33,185
He seems fierce.

281
00:16:34,224 --> 00:16:36,420
Military men carry themselves
with an air of authority.

282
00:16:36,905 --> 00:16:39,265
In addition, Duke Ying
fights on the battlefields

283
00:16:39,664 --> 00:16:41,260
and is highly respected by all soldiers.

284
00:16:42,265 --> 00:16:43,224
He accepts the medicine.

285
00:16:46,305 --> 00:16:48,385
It seems the tea tax report

286
00:16:48,505 --> 00:16:49,505
works on him.

287
00:16:49,824 --> 00:16:51,665
Now, we'll wait and see

288
00:16:51,665 --> 00:16:53,905
if he involves himself
in Senior Daoyan's case.

289
00:16:53,984 --> 00:16:56,104
If he's truly as just

290
00:16:56,104 --> 00:16:57,224
as rumored,

291
00:16:58,104 --> 00:16:59,624
he will preside over this case.

292
00:16:59,776 --> 00:17:01,420
Besides, he holds opinions
against Wang Yuan

293
00:17:01,425 --> 00:17:03,505
due to the military provision.

294
00:17:03,505 --> 00:17:05,065
We could take this opportunity

295
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:06,505
to intimidate them.

296
00:17:12,465 --> 00:17:13,824
Thank you, sir.

297
00:17:14,144 --> 00:17:15,225
- Thank you, miss.
- Wait.

298
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:16,679
Please get up.

299
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,545
- Bring your child to get treatment.
- Don't wait.

300
00:17:19,065 --> 00:17:19,785
Go now.

301
00:17:22,705 --> 00:17:23,505
Your Lordship,

302
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,260
Seventh Lady and Luo Shenyuan
are over there.

303
00:17:28,265 --> 00:17:29,065
Seventh Lady.

304
00:17:33,624 --> 00:17:35,624
I didn't expect to run into you here,
Your Lordship.

305
00:17:37,184 --> 00:17:39,624
Mr. Luo, you become the top scorer
at your first attempt.

306
00:17:40,065 --> 00:17:40,904
You're exceptional.

307
00:17:41,328 --> 00:17:42,500
Thank you for your compliment.

308
00:17:44,904 --> 00:17:47,424
I hope this is the start.

309
00:17:50,584 --> 00:17:51,619
I was interrogating criminals

310
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:52,860
at Dengwen Drum Court last night,

311
00:17:52,864 --> 00:17:54,104
and I'm heading home.

312
00:17:54,104 --> 00:17:56,424
I didn't expect to run into you here.

313
00:17:56,656 --> 00:17:58,020
It must've been tough, Your Lordship.

314
00:18:00,505 --> 00:18:02,384
This is a tough guy.

315
00:18:02,904 --> 00:18:04,664
We've already used all kinds
of torture on him,

316
00:18:04,896 --> 00:18:07,020
but he still wouldn't confess
who his accomplices were.

317
00:18:13,584 --> 00:18:15,705
I have no knowledge
about how interrogation works,

318
00:18:15,864 --> 00:18:17,424
so I can't be of help.

319
00:18:20,384 --> 00:18:21,184
It's fine.

320
00:18:21,785 --> 00:18:23,465
Any criminal who comes under my charge,

321
00:18:23,664 --> 00:18:25,824
even if he's as tough as an iron,

322
00:18:26,065 --> 00:18:27,904
I will find ways to make him confess.

323
00:18:35,904 --> 00:18:36,705
Seventh Lady,

324
00:18:38,624 --> 00:18:39,904
may I have a word with you?

325
00:18:45,384 --> 00:18:47,259
We need to head back

326
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,528
to attend to something urgent.

327
00:18:50,305 --> 00:18:51,664
May I have a word with you?

328
00:18:57,505 --> 00:18:58,305
Seventh Lady.

329
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,225
Just ask away, Marquis Lu.

330
00:19:02,505 --> 00:19:03,945
I found the nameless tomb

331
00:19:03,985 --> 00:19:05,465
according to your description.

332
00:19:06,262 --> 00:19:07,982
There's a woman's body inside.

333
00:19:08,505 --> 00:19:11,104
Did you dig up the grave?

334
00:19:12,864 --> 00:19:14,305
Poor Mei.

335
00:19:14,664 --> 00:19:16,065
Even her soul can't rest in peace.

336
00:19:16,465 --> 00:19:18,785
What else do you want to ask, then?

337
00:19:18,904 --> 00:19:20,384
The body belongs to a woman,

338
00:19:20,705 --> 00:19:22,265
but my hunch tells me

339
00:19:22,624 --> 00:19:23,664
she's not Mei.

340
00:19:25,104 --> 00:19:26,624
If that's what you believe,

341
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:28,065
there's nothing more I can say.

342
00:19:28,112 --> 00:19:30,060
I always have the feeling
that Mei is still alive.

343
00:19:31,824 --> 00:19:33,344
Your obsession runs too deep.

344
00:19:46,904 --> 00:19:48,025
It's getting late.

345
00:19:48,305 --> 00:19:50,584
Our parents may worry about us.

346
00:19:50,785 --> 00:19:51,824
Let's head back.

347
00:19:55,864 --> 00:19:56,904
Are you all right?

348
00:19:57,305 --> 00:19:58,505
Let's go home.

349
00:20:14,992 --> 00:20:16,060
Why are your hands so cold?

350
00:20:17,184 --> 00:20:18,424
Is something disturbing you?

351
00:20:23,184 --> 00:20:23,985
Third Brother,

352
00:20:24,785 --> 00:20:26,584
I know what you want to ask.

353
00:20:27,904 --> 00:20:29,104
Just now, Lu Jiaxue

354
00:20:29,904 --> 00:20:32,305
asked me something about paper-cutting.

355
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:34,184
He also likes paper-cutting.

356
00:20:36,864 --> 00:20:38,025
You don't need to find excuses

357
00:20:38,505 --> 00:20:39,904
if you don't want to tell.

358
00:20:41,025 --> 00:20:42,505
But if he ever bothers you again,

359
00:20:43,104 --> 00:20:44,424
you must tell me.

360
00:20:47,686 --> 00:20:48,505
I know.

361
00:20:49,904 --> 00:20:51,505
He mentioned Senior Daoyan

362
00:20:51,505 --> 00:20:53,025
to you

363
00:20:53,624 --> 00:20:55,065
on purpose.

364
00:20:57,104 --> 00:20:58,505
Daoyan is the petitioner.

365
00:20:59,465 --> 00:21:01,424
Plus, His Majesty has ordered a retrial.

366
00:21:01,664 --> 00:21:03,265
They won't go too far.

367
00:21:03,904 --> 00:21:05,065
Let's hope Duke Ying will

368
00:21:05,985 --> 00:21:07,305
do as we wish.

369
00:21:34,904 --> 00:21:35,664
Young Lady,

370
00:21:37,104 --> 00:21:38,225
is Lu Jiaxue

371
00:21:38,265 --> 00:21:39,624
the friend with injured eyes

372
00:21:39,624 --> 00:21:41,104
that you often looked after

373
00:21:41,664 --> 00:21:43,065
while we were in the side yard?

374
00:21:44,864 --> 00:21:45,664
Yes, it's him.

375
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,824
Did you fall into the water

376
00:21:47,864 --> 00:21:49,505
because of him?

377
00:21:49,664 --> 00:21:50,465
Qing Qu.

378
00:21:52,065 --> 00:21:53,065
Don't tell anyone

379
00:21:53,505 --> 00:21:55,025
about this.

380
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,904
I don't want to complicate things.

381
00:21:57,505 --> 00:21:58,384
I have nothing to do

382
00:21:58,705 --> 00:22:00,225
with him.

383
00:22:00,305 --> 00:22:02,065
He keeps bothering you

384
00:22:02,344 --> 00:22:03,904
because he recognizes you?

385
00:22:04,904 --> 00:22:06,305
He probably isn't sure about it.

386
00:22:07,624 --> 00:22:08,584
I told him

387
00:22:09,265 --> 00:22:10,505
that the tomb in the side yard

388
00:22:11,465 --> 00:22:12,424
was mine.

389
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,904
Do you mean Mei's grave?

390
00:22:18,065 --> 00:22:19,505
Mei passed away after falling ill.

391
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:21,424
She served me before.

392
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,440
I'm sorry to drag her into this.

393
00:22:24,705 --> 00:22:25,904
Her soul can't even find peace

394
00:22:26,305 --> 00:22:27,584
after death.

395
00:22:32,424 --> 00:22:33,305
Sixth Sister.

396
00:22:33,624 --> 00:22:34,864
I came here to check on Fugui.

397
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,280
Sixth Sister,

398
00:22:36,505 --> 00:22:37,824
you've lost weight.

399
00:22:39,305 --> 00:22:40,144
I don't think so.

400
00:22:40,305 --> 00:22:42,065
Young Lady has been worrying

401
00:22:42,065 --> 00:22:43,305
and couldn't eat well.

402
00:22:43,305 --> 00:22:44,580
That's why she's lost some weight.

403
00:22:44,584 --> 00:22:46,065
Don't listen to her.

404
00:22:46,985 --> 00:22:47,785
Sixth Sister,

405
00:22:48,104 --> 00:22:50,025
do you have someone you like?

406
00:22:50,184 --> 00:22:52,904
You lost weight because you miss him?

407
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,720
I heard that Aunt has been taking you

408
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,352
to visit the Princess Royal
a lot lately.

409
00:22:56,904 --> 00:22:59,465
Enough. Stop making fun of me.

410
00:22:59,904 --> 00:23:02,305
All right, Sixth Sister. Don't sigh.

411
00:23:02,465 --> 00:23:04,184
Fugui will also sigh with you.

412
00:23:04,624 --> 00:23:05,664
Right, Fugui?

413
00:23:08,225 --> 00:23:10,785
Have you seen Sixth Uncle lately?

414
00:23:14,904 --> 00:23:16,584
I haven't seen him

415
00:23:16,584 --> 00:23:17,904
since the results announcement.

416
00:23:18,424 --> 00:23:20,505
Mother said he was feeling down.

417
00:23:20,545 --> 00:23:22,384
Perhaps he's been staying in his abode.

418
00:23:25,144 --> 00:23:25,945
Mother.

419
00:23:27,104 --> 00:23:28,465
Did you see Lin Mao?

420
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:31,300
He didn't do well in the exam this time,

421
00:23:31,305 --> 00:23:32,545
so I gave him an earful.

422
00:23:32,904 --> 00:23:34,505
I thought he was reflecting in his room,

423
00:23:34,505 --> 00:23:36,505
but he left a letter and ran away.

424
00:23:37,745 --> 00:23:38,505
I'll go look for it.

425
00:23:39,144 --> 00:23:40,985
But the border market has stopped.

426
00:23:40,985 --> 00:23:42,344
Where can you get it?

427
00:23:42,344 --> 00:23:43,184
Don't worry.

428
00:23:43,664 --> 00:23:44,705
I sincerely admit my fault,

429
00:23:44,705 --> 00:23:46,265
and I'll make up for it.

430
00:23:46,505 --> 00:23:48,584
Wait for me.

431
00:23:48,864 --> 00:23:50,384
Did he really go to look for it?

432
00:23:50,384 --> 00:23:51,104
What?

433
00:23:52,065 --> 00:23:52,904
Yes?

434
00:23:54,584 --> 00:23:56,904
Maybe he's gone back to Lin'an.

435
00:23:57,225 --> 00:23:58,265
He failed the exam

436
00:23:58,265 --> 00:24:00,339
and kept saying he wouldn't
sit for the exam again.

437
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,504
I was so angry that I told him

438
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:03,300
to go back to Lin'an
and tell our parents.

439
00:24:03,305 --> 00:24:04,864
He didn't even want to go back.

440
00:24:05,584 --> 00:24:07,705
Mother, have you sent someone
to look for him?

441
00:24:07,705 --> 00:24:08,505
Why should I?

442
00:24:09,465 --> 00:24:10,904
I won't look for him.

443
00:24:10,945 --> 00:24:12,144
He's driving me crazy.

444
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:15,624
Did...

445
00:24:16,144 --> 00:24:17,824
Did he really go there?

446
00:24:18,025 --> 00:24:18,824
Sixth Sister,

447
00:24:19,305 --> 00:24:21,025
do you know
where the Sixth Uncle has gone?

448
00:24:22,305 --> 00:24:23,419
The other day, I told him

449
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,220
I was running out
of good-quality basil leaves.

450
00:24:25,225 --> 00:24:26,664
He said he would go get some for me.

451
00:24:26,664 --> 00:24:29,305
I honestly don't know where he has gone.

452
00:24:29,545 --> 00:24:31,225
He can't go to the north, can he?

453
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,656
But there's a war
at the northern border right now.

454
00:24:35,104 --> 00:24:37,025
The border market is closed.

455
00:24:37,144 --> 00:24:39,305
I'm afraid it won't be easy to find him.

456
00:24:39,664 --> 00:24:42,624
What if he's in danger?

457
00:24:42,824 --> 00:24:43,624
No, he won't.

458
00:24:43,705 --> 00:24:46,225
He may look silly,

459
00:24:46,624 --> 00:24:47,465
but

460
00:24:47,624 --> 00:24:49,664
he's quick-witted.

461
00:24:49,864 --> 00:24:50,824
As if.

462
00:24:50,824 --> 00:24:52,305
I was just saying that.

463
00:24:52,305 --> 00:24:53,584
Did he go there to look for it?

464
00:24:53,584 --> 00:24:54,923
Don't overthink it, Sixth Sister.

465
00:24:54,985 --> 00:24:56,659
Even though Mother won't admit it,

466
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,464
I'm sure she'll send someone
to look for him.

467
00:25:15,864 --> 00:25:17,945
Madam, don't be upset.

468
00:25:18,664 --> 00:25:21,065
I believe the late Young Master
wouldn't want

469
00:25:21,065 --> 00:25:22,265
to see you in such distress.

470
00:25:25,864 --> 00:25:27,864
If he were still alive,

471
00:25:29,864 --> 00:25:32,184
he would've married
and had children by now.

472
00:25:34,196 --> 00:25:35,025
True.

473
00:25:35,465 --> 00:25:37,465
If it weren't for Madam Gu

474
00:25:37,465 --> 00:25:39,184
introducing that quack...

475
00:25:41,505 --> 00:25:42,545
Let's go back.

476
00:26:13,065 --> 00:26:14,104
Careful.

477
00:26:14,664 --> 00:26:15,705
First Master.

478
00:26:22,904 --> 00:26:23,584
All right.

479
00:26:24,065 --> 00:26:25,505
I'll sit here for a while.

480
00:26:26,065 --> 00:26:27,065
You may go.

481
00:26:27,785 --> 00:26:29,265
- You may go.
- Yes.

482
00:26:41,465 --> 00:26:42,424
First Master?

483
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:44,025
First Master.

484
00:26:56,785 --> 00:26:58,664
First Master, are you all right?

485
00:26:58,785 --> 00:27:00,144
Are you feeling unwell?

486
00:27:06,945 --> 00:27:08,144
Minglan,

487
00:27:08,664 --> 00:27:09,465
is it you?

488
00:27:12,824 --> 00:27:14,025
Is it you, Minglan?

489
00:27:15,305 --> 00:27:17,144
Are you drunk?

490
00:27:17,824 --> 00:27:19,025
Is it you?

491
00:27:26,025 --> 00:27:27,184
Yes, I'm drunk.

492
00:27:27,384 --> 00:27:28,664
I can only see you in my dream

493
00:27:28,664 --> 00:27:30,065
when I'm drunk.

494
00:27:37,904 --> 00:27:39,104
Is it you, Minglan?

495
00:27:40,584 --> 00:27:41,664
It's really you.

496
00:27:41,985 --> 00:27:44,424
Minglan.

497
00:27:44,424 --> 00:27:45,505
It's you.

498
00:27:45,505 --> 00:27:47,225
Minglan, don't go.

499
00:27:48,505 --> 00:27:50,945
Minglan.

500
00:27:52,736 --> 00:27:53,860
- Minglan.
- First Master.

501
00:27:53,864 --> 00:27:54,225
Minglan.

502
00:27:54,864 --> 00:27:56,065
You're drunk, First Master.

503
00:27:56,344 --> 00:27:57,025
Minglan,

504
00:27:58,225 --> 00:27:59,025
it's me.

505
00:28:00,065 --> 00:28:02,424
Minglan, don't go. Minglan.

506
00:28:02,664 --> 00:28:03,465
Minglan.

507
00:28:04,664 --> 00:28:06,904
Come and help First Master back
to his room.

508
00:28:06,904 --> 00:28:07,705
- Yes.
- Yes.

509
00:28:17,939 --> 00:28:18,945
Ms. Yang,

510
00:28:19,864 --> 00:28:21,184
it's late.

511
00:28:21,664 --> 00:28:23,624
Why haven't you rested yet?

512
00:28:23,824 --> 00:28:25,104
I was about to return to my room.

513
00:28:25,904 --> 00:28:27,785
Madam Chen, First Master...

514
00:28:27,785 --> 00:28:29,184
It's getting late.

515
00:28:30,025 --> 00:28:31,265
You should go and rest.

516
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,992
(Zhijie Abode)

517
00:28:47,184 --> 00:28:48,065
Madam,

518
00:28:49,025 --> 00:28:51,305
why didn't you let me
teach this woman a lesson?

519
00:28:52,144 --> 00:28:53,705
When she first came here,

520
00:28:53,705 --> 00:28:55,505
I knew she was up to something.

521
00:28:55,745 --> 00:28:58,104
Finally, her true color
is revealed tonight.

522
00:28:59,745 --> 00:29:02,584
She's a guest here.

523
00:29:03,945 --> 00:29:05,459
How would you teach her a lesson?

524
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,624
But I heard that First Master

525
00:29:06,904 --> 00:29:08,465
spent quite some money

526
00:29:08,505 --> 00:29:10,904
to redeem all the things she had pawned.

527
00:29:12,144 --> 00:29:13,184
Will First Master

528
00:29:13,184 --> 00:29:15,065
develop feelings for her

529
00:29:15,344 --> 00:29:16,945
because she resembles Madam Gu?

530
00:29:19,065 --> 00:29:21,265
She'll have to leave here eventually.

531
00:29:23,664 --> 00:29:25,305
You're right, Madam.

532
00:29:26,424 --> 00:29:27,265
Today

533
00:29:29,025 --> 00:29:30,505
is my eldest son's death anniversary,

534
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:35,305
but he has forgotten.

535
00:29:37,624 --> 00:29:39,305
Instead, he still remembers

536
00:29:40,144 --> 00:29:41,545
that woman.

537
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,968
(Blossoms in Spring, Fruits in Autumn)

538
00:29:54,094 --> 00:29:55,384
It's been days.

539
00:29:56,305 --> 00:29:57,705
Why hasn't he returned yet?

540
00:29:58,664 --> 00:30:00,904
Doesn't he know we're all worried?

541
00:30:01,025 --> 00:30:03,305
Madam Lin, don't stress yourself out.

542
00:30:03,584 --> 00:30:05,225
Perhaps, like Sixth Master Lin said,

543
00:30:05,225 --> 00:30:07,505
he got too tired from studying,
and he went out

544
00:30:07,505 --> 00:30:08,584
to clear his mind.

545
00:30:08,664 --> 00:30:09,584
He's tired?

546
00:30:10,745 --> 00:30:12,144
It's not like I'm always relaxed.

547
00:30:13,025 --> 00:30:13,824
How am I going

548
00:30:15,065 --> 00:30:16,824
to explain to my parents?

549
00:30:17,705 --> 00:30:18,505
By the way,

550
00:30:19,144 --> 00:30:20,265
any news

551
00:30:20,864 --> 00:30:22,025
from the people we sent out?

552
00:30:23,104 --> 00:30:24,384
Not for now.

553
00:30:24,824 --> 00:30:25,624
Not yet?

554
00:30:29,104 --> 00:30:30,465
Are you all right, Madam?

555
00:30:31,065 --> 00:30:32,265
Help me back to my room.

556
00:30:42,545 --> 00:30:43,745
Come.

557
00:30:44,545 --> 00:30:45,265
Hurry!

558
00:30:46,664 --> 00:30:47,465
Come!

559
00:30:49,104 --> 00:30:50,745
- Young Lady.
- Have you got any news?

560
00:30:51,104 --> 00:30:51,664
How's it?

561
00:30:51,664 --> 00:30:53,424
Caifu Abode is in a mess now.

562
00:30:53,424 --> 00:30:55,505
Sixth Master Lin hasn't returned,

563
00:30:55,552 --> 00:30:57,340
and Madam Lin is so worried
that she falls sick.

564
00:30:58,785 --> 00:31:00,305
If he really went there

565
00:31:00,305 --> 00:31:01,785
because of my joke,

566
00:31:01,824 --> 00:31:03,465
I'd be the sinner.

567
00:31:03,465 --> 00:31:05,505
Sixth Lady, it's time to go back.

568
00:31:05,505 --> 00:31:06,664
We've been out for too long.

569
00:31:06,664 --> 00:31:08,985
It'll be troublesome
if Madam Chen questions us.

570
00:31:10,545 --> 00:31:12,144
All right. Let's go.

571
00:31:12,584 --> 00:31:13,384
Let's leave.

572
00:31:28,824 --> 00:31:29,624
First Master.

573
00:31:33,184 --> 00:31:34,945
I had a few drinks with my fellows
last night.

574
00:31:35,025 --> 00:31:36,424
I was drunk

575
00:31:36,624 --> 00:31:37,904
and accidentally offended you.

576
00:31:38,584 --> 00:31:39,664
When I woke up this morning,

577
00:31:40,344 --> 00:31:41,751
I'm truly embarrassed about...

578
00:31:41,776 --> 00:31:44,305
I forget what happened last night.

579
00:31:45,025 --> 00:31:46,305
I've outstayed my welcome here.

580
00:31:46,545 --> 00:31:49,424
Today, I came to bid everyone farewell.

581
00:31:49,505 --> 00:31:50,305
Bid farewell?

582
00:31:51,505 --> 00:31:53,745
But you haven't found your brother yet.

583
00:31:56,705 --> 00:31:59,505
Are you leaving because
of what happened last night?

584
00:31:59,985 --> 00:32:00,785
First Master,

585
00:32:01,505 --> 00:32:02,904
I ran into Madam Chen

586
00:32:02,985 --> 00:32:04,384
in the garden last night.

587
00:32:09,184 --> 00:32:10,785
Did she see anything?

588
00:32:11,305 --> 00:32:12,344
Madam Chen

589
00:32:12,505 --> 00:32:14,305
treated me as she always has.

590
00:32:14,945 --> 00:32:16,824
It's just that I feel uneasy.

591
00:32:17,144 --> 00:32:17,945
Besides,

592
00:32:18,065 --> 00:32:20,184
I can't stay here forever

593
00:32:20,584 --> 00:32:22,184
just because I haven't found my brother.

594
00:32:23,505 --> 00:32:25,624
All right. Understood.

595
00:32:26,104 --> 00:32:28,545
I'll have someone prepare
some money for you.

596
00:32:28,864 --> 00:32:29,664
Also,

597
00:32:29,664 --> 00:32:31,184
you pawned

598
00:32:31,265 --> 00:32:33,025
your gold hairpin, jade bracelet,

599
00:32:33,824 --> 00:32:35,065
and other things.

600
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:37,025
I've redeemed them.

601
00:32:37,265 --> 00:32:38,305
You don't have to do this.

602
00:32:38,305 --> 00:32:40,265
Ms. Yang, please don't refuse.

603
00:32:43,465 --> 00:32:44,945
I'm truly grateful to you

604
00:32:45,745 --> 00:32:47,505
for rescuing me and for all the help

605
00:32:48,184 --> 00:32:49,785
you've given me
during these days.

606
00:32:50,824 --> 00:32:51,624
I will never

607
00:32:53,065 --> 00:32:54,505
forget your kindness.

608
00:33:15,197 --> 00:33:15,785
Mother.

609
00:33:16,025 --> 00:33:17,225
I'm not drinking it.

610
00:33:17,505 --> 00:33:19,225
Please take at least a sip.

611
00:33:19,225 --> 00:33:21,904
The medicine can't heal my problem.

612
00:33:25,664 --> 00:33:26,505
Third Brother.

613
00:33:28,664 --> 00:33:30,104
Greetings, Mother.

614
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:31,785
I heard you're sick,

615
00:33:31,824 --> 00:33:33,144
so I came to visit you.

616
00:33:33,465 --> 00:33:35,584
I wanted to hold the top scorer

617
00:33:35,664 --> 00:33:36,705
celebration feast for you,

618
00:33:36,904 --> 00:33:38,664
but now I'm sick.

619
00:33:38,664 --> 00:33:40,144
It'll be delayed for a few days.

620
00:33:40,144 --> 00:33:40,904
Mother,

621
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,260
your health is more important.

622
00:33:42,465 --> 00:33:44,305
The banquet can wait until you recover.

623
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:47,824
Third Brother,
you came at the right time.

624
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,504
Mother doesn't want to
take the medicine.

625
00:33:51,216 --> 00:33:53,080
Mother, you don't want to
take the medicine?

626
00:33:53,705 --> 00:33:55,745
I'm fine. Just focus on your studies.

627
00:33:55,745 --> 00:33:57,305
Rui Xiang is here to serve me.

628
00:33:57,305 --> 00:33:58,505
You have to take the medicine.

629
00:33:58,904 --> 00:34:00,545
If you're sick, I can't focus

630
00:34:00,545 --> 00:34:01,705
on my studies.

631
00:34:01,744 --> 00:34:02,700
Let me feed you, Mother.

632
00:34:03,065 --> 00:34:04,424
Please drink a little, Mother.

633
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,616
The situation outside is chaotic.

634
00:34:17,905 --> 00:34:20,224
Sixth Uncle went out
without informing anyone.

635
00:34:20,505 --> 00:34:21,825
That's truly concerning.

636
00:34:22,744 --> 00:34:24,704
I will send someone to help
search for him.

637
00:34:26,184 --> 00:34:28,184
Any news from Duke Ying?

638
00:34:28,345 --> 00:34:29,304
His Majesty has permitted

639
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:32,144
Duke Ying to take part in the trial.

640
00:34:32,345 --> 00:34:33,184
That's great.

641
00:34:33,385 --> 00:34:34,459
With Duke Ying involved,

642
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:36,784
Wang Yuan won't be able to get
everything under his control.

643
00:34:37,945 --> 00:34:39,345
If Wang Yuan

644
00:34:40,425 --> 00:34:42,304
can be removed from this case

645
00:34:42,545 --> 00:34:43,945
and lose His Majesty's trust,

646
00:34:44,345 --> 00:34:45,584
that'd be even better.

647
00:34:46,104 --> 00:34:47,704
What is your next move?

648
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,919
(Duke Ying's Residence)

649
00:34:56,945 --> 00:34:57,865
Who are you?

650
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,392
How dare you block Duke Ying's way!

651
00:35:09,624 --> 00:35:10,505
What is this?

652
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:12,985
You'll find out if you read it.

653
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:13,784
I'm not reading it.

654
00:35:14,184 --> 00:35:14,985
You tell me.

655
00:35:16,905 --> 00:35:18,339
This is Chen Jiuheng's statement

656
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:19,728
from the Imperial Court of Judicial.

657
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,905
The mastermind
are Wang Yuan and Song Yingshan.

658
00:35:22,104 --> 00:35:23,385
Not only did they smuggle goods,

659
00:35:23,744 --> 00:35:25,300
but they also framed loyal officials

660
00:35:25,328 --> 00:35:27,060
and brought harm
to the nation and its people.

661
00:35:27,505 --> 00:35:28,465
I remember

662
00:35:28,825 --> 00:35:31,065
that all the witnesses
and important documents

663
00:35:31,184 --> 00:35:33,304
were destroyed

664
00:35:33,704 --> 00:35:35,744
in the fire
at the Imperial Court of Judicial.

665
00:35:36,624 --> 00:35:39,025
Where did you get this statement from?

666
00:35:40,825 --> 00:35:41,744
I obtained it

667
00:35:43,264 --> 00:35:44,505
through some effort.

668
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:48,264
Even if this statement is real,

669
00:35:48,264 --> 00:35:49,184
it's useless.

670
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,280
The party involved is dead.

671
00:35:51,465 --> 00:35:52,304
Be that as it may,

672
00:35:53,344 --> 00:35:55,100
you're the pillar of the nation
and a reliable

673
00:35:55,144 --> 00:35:56,224
official to His Majesty.

674
00:35:56,304 --> 00:35:57,664
If you can present this statement

675
00:35:57,664 --> 00:35:58,664
to His Majesty,

676
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:00,744
even if he doesn't completely trust it,

677
00:36:01,304 --> 00:36:02,664
he'll start to suspect Wang Yuan.

678
00:36:05,704 --> 00:36:07,744
So this is your true purpose.

679
00:36:08,385 --> 00:36:10,144
You knew
the military provisions were tight,

680
00:36:10,144 --> 00:36:12,025
so you used the tea tax to lure me in.

681
00:36:12,545 --> 00:36:13,345
Now,

682
00:36:13,905 --> 00:36:15,825
you present this to me.

683
00:36:16,144 --> 00:36:17,784
Well-planned.

684
00:36:18,865 --> 00:36:22,025
You want me to fight your enemy for you?

685
00:36:24,505 --> 00:36:25,304
Speak up.

686
00:36:26,104 --> 00:36:27,304
Who are you?

687
00:36:30,304 --> 00:36:32,144
I'm Chen Jiuheng's disciple.

688
00:36:32,425 --> 00:36:34,144
I believe in your integrity,

689
00:36:35,104 --> 00:36:37,505
so I risked my life to block your way

690
00:36:38,224 --> 00:36:40,505
and deliver this evidence.

691
00:36:40,664 --> 00:36:43,505
I hope you will uphold justice.

692
00:36:52,065 --> 00:36:52,865
Ms. Yang.

693
00:36:54,624 --> 00:36:55,425
Seventh Lady.

694
00:36:55,865 --> 00:36:57,704
I heard you're leaving.

695
00:36:58,304 --> 00:36:59,905
Old Madam Luo and you are kind enough

696
00:37:00,224 --> 00:37:02,264
to keep me here

697
00:37:02,264 --> 00:37:03,505
and provide me with food.

698
00:37:03,704 --> 00:37:05,104
I feel bad about it.

699
00:37:05,825 --> 00:37:08,184
But you haven't found your brother yet.

700
00:37:08,304 --> 00:37:10,865
Where will you stay after leaving here?

701
00:37:11,072 --> 00:37:12,780
While I continue searching
for my brother,

702
00:37:13,425 --> 00:37:15,584
I'll deal with my situation accordingly.

703
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:21,624
Will you go to Minglan Hall?

704
00:37:22,184 --> 00:37:23,704
There are many orphans there.

705
00:37:23,704 --> 00:37:24,865
If you don't mind,

706
00:37:24,865 --> 00:37:26,224
you can stay there.

707
00:37:26,385 --> 00:37:27,545
I'd love to.

708
00:37:28,505 --> 00:37:30,345
You're truly kind, Seventh Lady.

709
00:37:30,465 --> 00:37:31,385
You are welcome.

710
00:37:31,545 --> 00:37:33,184
If you're willing to go there,

711
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:34,865
I can take you to Minglan Hall tomorrow.

712
00:37:35,184 --> 00:37:35,985
Young Lady,

713
00:37:36,584 --> 00:37:37,985
does "Minglan"

714
00:37:39,584 --> 00:37:40,784
have any special meaning?

715
00:37:41,664 --> 00:37:44,865
It's my mother's name.

716
00:37:46,744 --> 00:37:48,104
I'm sorry to ask.

717
00:37:48,505 --> 00:37:49,784
It's because of the rumors I heard

718
00:37:50,425 --> 00:37:51,825
since I arrived.

719
00:37:53,224 --> 00:37:54,545
Everyone says

720
00:37:54,545 --> 00:37:55,545
you resemble my mother,

721
00:37:55,545 --> 00:37:56,945
right?

722
00:37:57,345 --> 00:37:58,704
I hope

723
00:37:58,704 --> 00:38:00,505
you don't feel offended

724
00:38:00,825 --> 00:38:02,264
by my question.

725
00:38:02,304 --> 00:38:03,104
Not at all.

726
00:38:03,545 --> 00:38:05,304
That's true.

727
00:38:10,865 --> 00:38:11,664
Look,

728
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:12,784
this is delicious.

729
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:14,425
I want this one.

730
00:38:14,624 --> 00:38:16,905
Ms. Yang, thank you for helping us.

731
00:38:16,985 --> 00:38:18,025
Without you,

732
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,623
both Qing Qu and I
wouldn't have been able

733
00:38:19,624 --> 00:38:20,744
to carry all this.

734
00:38:20,985 --> 00:38:22,905
Seventh Lady, you have a kind heart.

735
00:38:23,664 --> 00:38:25,664
I'm happy to help.

736
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,260
If there's another
chance like this later

737
00:38:27,264 --> 00:38:28,664
feel free to ask me.

738
00:38:29,144 --> 00:38:30,465
Actually, I'm only doing

739
00:38:30,465 --> 00:38:31,905
a small part.

740
00:38:32,104 --> 00:38:34,545
My third brother
prepared most of the things.

741
00:38:34,545 --> 00:38:35,304
True.

742
00:38:35,304 --> 00:38:36,505
Third Young Master and you

743
00:38:36,505 --> 00:38:37,905
are kind people.

744
00:38:38,304 --> 00:38:39,905
Besides, you are close siblings.

745
00:38:40,304 --> 00:38:42,584
I really admire that.

746
00:38:48,624 --> 00:38:49,545
Have mercy.

747
00:38:49,664 --> 00:38:51,345
Show me some mercy. Please give me food.

748
00:38:54,025 --> 00:38:55,465
You're Ms. Yang, right?

749
00:38:55,865 --> 00:38:57,945
Your brother is at the refugee camp
in the northwest.

750
00:38:57,952 --> 00:38:59,040
He's been looking for you.

751
00:38:59,304 --> 00:39:00,104
Really?

752
00:39:00,624 --> 00:39:01,865
I'm not sure if he's still here.

753
00:39:01,865 --> 00:39:02,865
You should go check it out.

754
00:39:02,865 --> 00:39:03,788
All right.

755
00:39:04,945 --> 00:39:05,905
Food is over there.

756
00:39:05,905 --> 00:39:06,624
Thank you.

757
00:39:07,865 --> 00:39:08,664
Seventh Lady,

758
00:39:08,825 --> 00:39:10,385
I want to go to the refugee camp

759
00:39:10,385 --> 00:39:11,345
to look for my brother.

760
00:39:11,545 --> 00:39:12,825
How can you get there alone?

761
00:39:12,825 --> 00:39:14,505
I'll go with you. Come on.

762
00:39:14,664 --> 00:39:15,505
Sure.

763
00:39:18,385 --> 00:39:19,505
Are you all right, Ms. Yang?

764
00:39:19,784 --> 00:39:20,584
Qing Qu.

765
00:39:21,304 --> 00:39:23,345
- Did you sprain your foot?
- Ms. Yang, let me check.

766
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:26,640
You can't go there like this.

767
00:39:27,104 --> 00:39:28,104
Well, Qing Qu.

768
00:39:28,104 --> 00:39:29,865
You help Ms. Yang inside to rest.

769
00:39:30,144 --> 00:39:32,104
Yes, Young Lady.

770
00:39:35,104 --> 00:39:36,505
No, I can't.

771
00:39:36,664 --> 00:39:38,104
If I'm late,

772
00:39:38,144 --> 00:39:40,224
my brother might already be gone.

773
00:39:40,425 --> 00:39:41,425
But your foot...

774
00:39:42,945 --> 00:39:44,584
How about this? I'll go for you.

775
00:39:44,744 --> 00:39:46,624
I'll bring him back if I find him.

776
00:39:48,025 --> 00:39:49,584
Thank you so much, Seventh Lady.

777
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:53,552
My brother's name is Yang Zhijie.

778
00:39:53,985 --> 00:39:55,664
I've been carrying this bracelet
with me.

779
00:39:55,985 --> 00:39:57,144
If you find him,

780
00:39:57,584 --> 00:39:59,905
he'll understand when he sees it.

781
00:40:00,104 --> 00:40:00,905
All right.

782
00:40:01,104 --> 00:40:03,099
Qing Qu, take good care of Ms. Yang.

783
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:03,872
Yes, Young Lady.

784
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:06,545
Come.

785
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:30,385
Is this the carriage?

786
00:40:30,784 --> 00:40:31,664
Yes, this is the one.

787
00:40:41,065 --> 00:40:41,865
Why are you...

788
00:40:44,825 --> 00:40:46,224
What's going on outside?

789
00:40:48,744 --> 00:40:49,545
Who are you?

790
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,280
(Minglan Hall)

791
00:40:59,584 --> 00:41:00,545
Give me the ball.

792
00:41:00,545 --> 00:41:01,345
Over here.

793
00:41:03,624 --> 00:41:04,425
I want the ball, too.

794
00:41:05,184 --> 00:41:06,065
You won't get it.

795
00:41:08,985 --> 00:41:09,784
Pass it here.

796
00:41:14,721 --> 00:41:15,761
Why are you standing here?

797
00:41:16,016 --> 00:41:17,660
What brings you here,
Third Young Master?

798
00:41:17,664 --> 00:41:19,385
Xue Zhi told me Yining was here,

799
00:41:19,385 --> 00:41:20,304
so I came.

800
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,580
Young Lady went to the refugee camp

801
00:41:21,584 --> 00:41:22,784
in the northwest to help Ms. Yang

802
00:41:22,784 --> 00:41:24,065
find his brother.

803
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:26,304
It's been half of a day,
but she hasn't returned yet.

804
00:41:26,505 --> 00:41:27,505
I'm worried about her.

805
00:41:27,744 --> 00:41:28,664
Refugee camp?

806
00:41:32,025 --> 00:41:32,624
Well.

807
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:34,945
Tell Shao'an to bring some people over.

808
00:41:35,104 --> 00:41:36,224
I'll go look for her first.

809
00:41:36,304 --> 00:41:37,104
Yes.

810
00:41:56,025 --> 00:41:57,905
(Jimo House)
Shao'an!

811
00:41:59,825 --> 00:42:01,465
Qing Qu, why are you panicking?

812
00:42:01,632 --> 00:42:02,779
Seventh Lady is in trouble.

813
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:04,400
Third Young Master wants you
to bring some people

814
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,640
to the refugee camp in the northwest.

815
00:42:05,664 --> 00:42:06,784
All right. Got it.

816
00:44:00,224 --> 00:44:01,144
