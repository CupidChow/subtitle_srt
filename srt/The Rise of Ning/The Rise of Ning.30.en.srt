=The Rise of Ning=

00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,320
(Adapted from Wen Tan's novel "Chancellor
Training Handbook" from Jinjiang Literature)

3
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,509
=Episode 30=

4
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,600
(Yanrong Pavilion)

5
00:01:41,681 --> 00:01:42,481
Uncle.

6
00:01:43,377 --> 00:01:45,367
Back then, you just left
the courtyard not long ago.

7
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,040
You had your bitter reasons
for doing so.

8
00:01:47,359 --> 00:01:49,839
There's a deep misunderstanding
between you and Seventh Lady.

9
00:01:50,414 --> 00:01:52,233
Why didn't you explain yourself to her?

10
00:01:54,717 --> 00:01:56,698
She wouldn't even
admit her identity in front of me.

11
00:01:57,391 --> 00:01:58,491
How can I explain myself?

12
00:01:59,218 --> 00:02:00,520
Song Ziyun

13
00:02:00,616 --> 00:02:01,646
is still denying

14
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,840
that Seventh Lady was Mei,
the lady you were looking for.

15
00:02:04,182 --> 00:02:05,491
I knew that she was lying.

16
00:02:09,086 --> 00:02:11,225
If so, we should let the two
confront each other alone.

17
00:02:20,671 --> 00:02:21,920
Where is Song Ziyun right now?

18
00:02:23,487 --> 00:02:24,287
Your Lordship.

19
00:02:24,432 --> 00:02:26,688
She's still locked away.
However, she's pretty obedient.

20
00:02:28,389 --> 00:02:29,400
Release her, then.

21
00:02:29,979 --> 00:02:31,623
See if she'll look for Luo Yining.

22
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:32,890
Understood.

23
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:02,288
His Lordship is sparing you today.

24
00:03:02,304 --> 00:03:03,664
He wants you to leave the capital.

25
00:03:03,664 --> 00:03:05,408
The further you leave
the capital, the better.

26
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,040
However, you're considered lucky.

27
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:09,376
Not only did the girl His Lordship
was looking for survive,

28
00:03:09,828 --> 00:03:12,080
but she also became
Duke Ying's legitimate daughter.

29
00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:14,491
That's the only reason

30
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,112
His Lordship is letting you off easily.

31
00:03:20,441 --> 00:03:21,242
Go.

32
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,480
Lu Jiaxue was here today.

33
00:03:40,656 --> 00:03:42,700
I heard that he has invited
plenty of ladies as well.

34
00:03:44,288 --> 00:03:45,530
Yining just left the residence.

35
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,360
Tell your men to keep
an eye on the pavilion.

36
00:03:47,376 --> 00:03:48,608
And, tell your men to keep an eye

37
00:03:48,789 --> 00:03:49,720
on Lu Jiaxue as well.

38
00:03:49,924 --> 00:03:50,724
Yes, Young Master.

39
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,220
Third Brother.

40
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:54,869
Come with me.

41
00:04:00,077 --> 00:04:01,600
Third Brother, take a look.

42
00:04:01,844 --> 00:04:03,160
What do you think about this room?

43
00:04:07,268 --> 00:04:08,069
Oh right...

44
00:04:08,308 --> 00:04:10,240
I can no longer address you
as Third Brother.

45
00:04:11,532 --> 00:04:12,440
I told you already.

46
00:04:12,939 --> 00:04:14,680
I'll always stay by your side

47
00:04:14,868 --> 00:04:16,669
no matter
if I'm your third brother or not.

48
00:04:16,704 --> 00:04:17,630
I'll always protect you.

49
00:04:17,744 --> 00:04:19,300
Whether you call me Third Brother or not

50
00:04:19,508 --> 00:04:20,308
doesn't matter.

51
00:04:20,384 --> 00:04:22,176
You can do whatever
feels comfortable to you.

52
00:04:22,891 --> 00:04:24,880
I feel at ease upon hearing that.

53
00:04:25,308 --> 00:04:27,440
I couldn't get used to it at first.

54
00:04:29,932 --> 00:04:31,160
Look over there.

55
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:33,787
Look. We lack two tea cups here.

56
00:04:33,868 --> 00:04:36,069
I plan to buy some
black-glazed rabbit hair tea cups.

57
00:04:36,149 --> 00:04:36,949
What do you think?

58
00:04:37,428 --> 00:04:38,229
That's right.

59
00:04:38,988 --> 00:04:40,196
Only a valuable cup like that

60
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:42,288
can match your status
as the owner of Yanrong Pavilion.

61
00:04:42,669 --> 00:04:44,589
And over here. Come and take a look.

62
00:04:46,732 --> 00:04:48,160
What do you think about this book rack?

63
00:04:48,589 --> 00:04:49,979
And the desk too.

64
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,419
Go and try it.

65
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:55,600
What do you think? Is it suitable?

66
00:04:56,077 --> 00:04:58,560
It's suitable for me.

67
00:04:59,184 --> 00:05:00,752
But don't you think it's too high

68
00:05:00,864 --> 00:05:02,520
if it's meant for you?

69
00:05:04,256 --> 00:05:05,488
Since it's meant for you,

70
00:05:05,488 --> 00:05:07,320
you should try it yourself.

71
00:05:33,589 --> 00:05:34,389
Third Brother.

72
00:05:34,983 --> 00:05:36,000
Actually...

73
00:05:36,735 --> 00:05:38,120
Actually, I prepared the room

74
00:05:38,201 --> 00:05:39,880
for you.

75
00:05:40,987 --> 00:05:43,188
Since you arranged
the backyard of Yanrong Pavilion

76
00:05:43,269 --> 00:05:44,720
to be my office,

77
00:05:44,956 --> 00:05:46,400
there should be a room for you

78
00:05:46,481 --> 00:05:47,520
here.

79
00:05:47,914 --> 00:05:50,280
This way, you can come here anytime,

80
00:05:50,768 --> 00:05:52,280
just like what you did in the past.

81
00:05:53,372 --> 00:05:54,440
You prepared it for me?

82
00:06:04,037 --> 00:06:05,037
Madam Liu.

83
00:06:05,508 --> 00:06:07,240
You came here early in the morning.

84
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,840
I suppose you're here for Yiyu's sake.

85
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:10,120
That's right, Old Madam Luo.

86
00:06:10,268 --> 00:06:11,349
We've already prepared

87
00:06:11,376 --> 00:06:13,264
the necessary proposal documents
and dowries.

88
00:06:13,388 --> 00:06:14,589
My eldest son said

89
00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:16,400
he couldn't wait any longer.

90
00:06:16,565 --> 00:06:17,964
He dragged me out of the house

91
00:06:18,045 --> 00:06:19,485
before dawn.

92
00:06:20,437 --> 00:06:21,640
It must've been tough.

93
00:06:26,924 --> 00:06:27,724
Young Lady Luo.

94
00:06:53,469 --> 00:06:54,480
Yiyu,

95
00:06:54,806 --> 00:06:56,566
your mother mentioned this to me

96
00:06:57,055 --> 00:06:59,336
when she was still here.

97
00:06:59,844 --> 00:07:02,200
However, we didn't discuss it in detail.

98
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,190
Today,

99
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:05,200
both Madam Liu and his mother

100
00:07:05,595 --> 00:07:07,560
have come here to ask for your hands.

101
00:07:08,151 --> 00:07:09,840
Although I'm in favor of the marriage,

102
00:07:10,117 --> 00:07:11,198
I still need

103
00:07:11,674 --> 00:07:12,960
to ask you this.

104
00:07:13,565 --> 00:07:15,320
What do you think about the marriage?

105
00:07:20,182 --> 00:07:20,982
I...

106
00:07:22,512 --> 00:07:24,864
Young Lady Luo, if you're willing
to be married to me,

107
00:07:25,187 --> 00:07:27,030
I'll definitely dote on you
with all my heart.

108
00:07:27,222 --> 00:07:29,038
We shall grow old together.

109
00:07:41,612 --> 00:07:42,694
I already told him

110
00:07:42,775 --> 00:07:44,320
that he was being too impatient.

111
00:07:44,496 --> 00:07:46,720
After all, an unfortunate incident
had just occurred here.

112
00:07:46,780 --> 00:07:48,928
But my son said he wasn't
willing to wait any longer.

113
00:07:49,054 --> 00:07:51,120
Sorry for being abrupt.

114
00:07:53,508 --> 00:07:54,508
In my opinion,

115
00:07:55,899 --> 00:07:56,880
maybe Young Lady Luo

116
00:07:57,188 --> 00:07:58,720
needs someone to understand her

117
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,560
and support her
when the times are tough.

118
00:08:03,789 --> 00:08:04,800
Yiyu?

119
00:08:13,165 --> 00:08:15,560
Why don't we wait a few more days?

120
00:08:18,836 --> 00:08:19,677
Old Madam Luo,

121
00:08:19,883 --> 00:08:21,360
we shall stop bothering you guys.

122
00:08:24,589 --> 00:08:25,389
Farewell.

123
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:36,813
Young Master Liu.

124
00:08:50,596 --> 00:08:51,755
Hurry and go.

125
00:09:01,488 --> 00:09:03,560
Young Master Liu, thank you
for not abandoning me.

126
00:09:07,189 --> 00:09:08,668
I'm willing to be married to you.

127
00:09:14,724 --> 00:09:15,524
Really?

128
00:09:23,469 --> 00:09:30,240
- Murderer!
- Murderer!

129
00:09:30,975 --> 00:09:32,640
- Go away!
- Get out of the way!

130
00:09:32,701 --> 00:09:34,100
- Mother!
- Mother!

131
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,200
Mother!

132
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:47,429
Mother!

133
00:10:02,405 --> 00:10:03,960
Will the Liu Family treat you well?

134
00:10:05,088 --> 00:10:06,544
Mother-in-law, please don't worry.

135
00:10:06,788 --> 00:10:08,120
Since I'm fortunate enough

136
00:10:08,337 --> 00:10:09,880
to marry Yiyu as my wife,

137
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,120
I'll love her and protect her
for the rest of my life.

138
00:10:12,453 --> 00:10:13,889
I won't let her suffer.

139
00:10:15,508 --> 00:10:16,600
No matter what you've done,

140
00:10:16,868 --> 00:10:18,240
it has nothing to do with Yixiu.

141
00:10:19,469 --> 00:10:20,967
I won't let anyone bully her.

142
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:27,640
Shan.

143
00:10:28,908 --> 00:10:30,709
You're finally willing to see me.

144
00:10:30,914 --> 00:10:31,714
Mother.

145
00:10:32,432 --> 00:10:33,800
I've decided to join the military.

146
00:10:34,128 --> 00:10:36,352
Aren't you going
to participate in the imperial exam?

147
00:10:36,828 --> 00:10:37,680
Since young,

148
00:10:38,409 --> 00:10:39,720
I've heeded your every advice.

149
00:10:39,888 --> 00:10:42,384
You wanted me to study and prepare for
the imperial exam.

150
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,780
No matter how much I disliked it,

151
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:45,168
I dare not go against your words.

152
00:10:46,173 --> 00:10:47,600
It's because you were always right.

153
00:10:48,932 --> 00:10:50,080
Now,

154
00:10:50,445 --> 00:10:52,480
I'm sure you're disappointed in me.

155
00:10:52,912 --> 00:10:54,848
I once abused my power
to bully people too.

156
00:10:55,092 --> 00:10:56,400
I've committed plenty of mistakes.

157
00:10:56,944 --> 00:10:58,640
Mother, I have no right
to criticize you.

158
00:10:58,955 --> 00:11:01,000
But from now on,
I'll turn over a new leaf.

159
00:11:01,268 --> 00:11:02,760
I'm here to bid you farewell.

160
00:11:04,787 --> 00:11:06,248
Mother, please take care.

161
00:11:07,899 --> 00:11:09,259
It's all my fault.

162
00:11:09,852 --> 00:11:10,652
In the end,

163
00:11:11,573 --> 00:11:13,400
you guys had to suffer.

164
00:11:20,508 --> 00:11:21,709
Please don't say that.

165
00:11:22,908 --> 00:11:23,709
Actually,

166
00:11:24,534 --> 00:11:26,174
I was the one who'd let the family down.

167
00:11:27,764 --> 00:11:30,760
What's the point in saying that now?

168
00:11:32,573 --> 00:11:33,373
Mother,

169
00:11:33,508 --> 00:11:34,709
the journey will be cold.

170
00:11:34,848 --> 00:11:36,480
Please take thicker clothing with you.

171
00:11:42,915 --> 00:11:43,716
Mother,

172
00:11:44,908 --> 00:11:46,560
you must take care of yourself.

173
00:11:47,028 --> 00:11:48,241
All of us

174
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,632
will be waiting for your return.

175
00:11:53,508 --> 00:11:54,308
Waiting for my return?

176
00:11:55,732 --> 00:11:58,280
I'm afraid there's no...

177
00:12:04,562 --> 00:12:05,840
Time's up. Let us depart.

178
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,920
(Spirit Tablet of Madam Gu)

179
00:12:58,508 --> 00:12:59,308
Mother.

180
00:13:00,468 --> 00:13:01,628
Your murderer

181
00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:03,709
has already been convicted and exiled.

182
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:08,286
Third Brother has helped me
to find my biological father.

183
00:13:08,868 --> 00:13:09,936
He's nice to me.

184
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,040
You were right about him.

185
00:13:13,283 --> 00:13:14,084
In the future,

186
00:13:14,788 --> 00:13:15,908
I'll depend on myself

187
00:13:16,383 --> 00:13:17,422
and strive to make a living.

188
00:13:18,469 --> 00:13:19,908
Everything will turn for the better.

189
00:13:20,852 --> 00:13:21,852
Don't worry about me.

190
00:13:33,952 --> 00:13:34,756
Yining.

191
00:13:38,004 --> 00:13:39,035
Order your men around

192
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,864
and see where you should
place these items.

193
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,592
Why did you bring
so many people and items

194
00:13:42,608 --> 00:13:43,560
with you?

195
00:13:43,788 --> 00:13:45,308
You aren't returning to our residence.

196
00:13:45,388 --> 00:13:46,188
I have to prepare

197
00:13:46,268 --> 00:13:48,160
something for you just in case.

198
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:49,881
And,

199
00:13:50,268 --> 00:13:51,308
I selected these maids

200
00:13:51,388 --> 00:13:52,788
just for you.

201
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,100
They can write and do calculations.

202
00:13:54,128 --> 00:13:55,120
They'll be of use to you.

203
00:13:56,381 --> 00:13:57,562
Greetings, Young Lady.

204
00:14:01,069 --> 00:14:01,908
These two bodyguards

205
00:14:01,988 --> 00:14:03,109
have been serving me

206
00:14:03,189 --> 00:14:04,084
for many years.

207
00:14:04,165 --> 00:14:05,245
They're martial arts expert.

208
00:14:06,413 --> 00:14:07,520
You two, listen closely.

209
00:14:08,205 --> 00:14:09,804
If anyone dares to bully her,

210
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,886
turn them into cripples

211
00:14:10,896 --> 00:14:12,176
and throw them onto the streets.

212
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:13,376
I'll bear the responsibilities.

213
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,748
Greetings, Young Lady!

214
00:14:18,189 --> 00:14:19,160
Lower your volume.

215
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,920
Don't scare my daughter.

216
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:23,320
We know our fault!
Young Lady, please punish us!

217
00:14:25,136 --> 00:14:28,176
They've been in the military camp for too long,
so forgot how to lower their voice.

218
00:14:29,484 --> 00:14:30,760
You two should get up first.

219
00:14:34,469 --> 00:14:35,429
Didn't you two hear her?

220
00:14:35,589 --> 00:14:36,640
Thank you, Young Lady!

221
00:14:40,528 --> 00:14:41,760
You two may leave first.

222
00:14:44,229 --> 00:14:45,069
Duke Ying,

223
00:14:45,437 --> 00:14:47,280
I appreciate your intention.

224
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:48,840
However,

225
00:14:48,995 --> 00:14:50,680
I already have Qing Qu with me.

226
00:14:50,868 --> 00:14:51,989
She knows martial arts.

227
00:14:52,069 --> 00:14:53,349
She can protect me

228
00:14:53,429 --> 00:14:54,588
during dangerous situations.

229
00:14:54,668 --> 00:14:56,509
I have one more maid with me

230
00:14:56,589 --> 00:14:57,469
called Xue Zhi.

231
00:14:57,908 --> 00:14:59,720
She grew up alongside me as well.

232
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,961
I can't put all
of these maids to good use.

233
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,120
And, my shop mostly tends

234
00:15:03,189 --> 00:15:04,600
to female customers.

235
00:15:04,709 --> 00:15:05,880
I'm afraid these guards

236
00:15:06,628 --> 00:15:07,868
won't be of use to me.

237
00:15:10,315 --> 00:15:11,360
You do have a point.

238
00:15:11,931 --> 00:15:14,240
I guess I was being inconsiderate.

239
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,540
Are you sure

240
00:15:16,053 --> 00:15:17,360
you want none of them?

241
00:15:20,623 --> 00:15:21,423
What about these?

242
00:15:22,508 --> 00:15:23,388
You at least

243
00:15:23,469 --> 00:15:24,668
have to accept these items.

244
00:15:24,752 --> 00:15:26,000
Your grandma and I picked them

245
00:15:26,084 --> 00:15:27,320
for you especially.

246
00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:29,160
But...

247
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:32,940
Mother.

248
00:15:34,028 --> 00:15:35,116
Duke Ying is here, huh?

249
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:36,891
Yining,

250
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,748
what kind of shop are you managing?

251
00:15:39,829 --> 00:15:41,468
- What's with all these goods?
- Goods?

252
00:15:41,709 --> 00:15:42,545
These are the items

253
00:15:42,748 --> 00:15:44,388
I bought for my daughter.

254
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,000
How could they be conventional goods?

255
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:50,760
If so, I suppose all these people

256
00:15:51,332 --> 00:15:52,720
aren't your customers, right?

257
00:15:53,029 --> 00:15:54,508
They look quite menacing.

258
00:15:54,655 --> 00:15:56,600
- But...
- And, there's no space

259
00:15:56,829 --> 00:15:58,280
to store all of these items.

260
00:15:58,515 --> 00:16:00,040
What's wrong with them?

261
00:16:00,508 --> 00:16:02,240
She can make selections.

262
00:16:02,321 --> 00:16:03,349
These are barely enough

263
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:04,548
for my daughter, you know?

264
00:16:04,576 --> 00:16:06,032
This place looks shabby without them.

265
00:16:06,836 --> 00:16:09,157
Quality matters more than quantity.

266
00:16:09,829 --> 00:16:10,960
I prepared everything

267
00:16:10,992 --> 00:16:12,720
from food, clothing,
to her daily necessities

268
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,208
when she lived at the Luo's Residence.

269
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,240
I know what she likes

270
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:16,480
the best.

271
00:16:16,764 --> 00:16:17,768
Bring the items

272
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:18,840
I've brought here.

273
00:16:18,928 --> 00:16:19,920
Show me around, won't you?

274
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,420
Mother,

275
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:24,725
this is where the shopkeeper

276
00:16:24,806 --> 00:16:25,886
does her accounts.

277
00:16:27,045 --> 00:16:28,155
Female customers

278
00:16:28,236 --> 00:16:29,160
can use the mirror

279
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,160
to see whether they like
their makeup look.

280
00:16:42,709 --> 00:16:43,509
Where's Yining?

281
00:16:44,307 --> 00:16:45,680
She went to prepare some snacks.

282
00:16:48,069 --> 00:16:49,069
Madam Lin,

283
00:16:49,484 --> 00:16:50,405
I've offended you

284
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,480
at the Luo's Residence a few days ago.

285
00:16:52,947 --> 00:16:54,480
Let me make it up to you today.

286
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:56,067
And,

287
00:16:56,096 --> 00:16:57,380
since you've taken care of Yining

288
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,672
on my behalf for many years,

289
00:17:00,192 --> 00:17:01,808
I've prepared some modest gifts for you.

290
00:17:02,308 --> 00:17:04,240
I took this from the palace.

291
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,509
Duke Ying, you're too courteous.

292
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:09,428
Thank you.

293
00:17:16,852 --> 00:17:19,840
What kinds of accessories
do Yining like?

294
00:17:22,427 --> 00:17:23,787
She likes the usual accessories

295
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:24,880
used by ladies.

296
00:17:24,992 --> 00:17:26,416
Something like hairpins and all.

297
00:17:27,466 --> 00:17:28,266
Isn't this a hairpin?

298
00:17:30,188 --> 00:17:31,259
She likes something simpler.

299
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,130
Something with flowers,
birds, insects, or plants.

300
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:34,496
The color mustn't be too vibrant

301
00:17:34,565 --> 00:17:36,827
or too eye-catching.

302
00:17:41,904 --> 00:17:43,248
What kind of material, then?

303
00:17:43,966 --> 00:17:44,845
Something light.

304
00:17:44,864 --> 00:17:46,016
Gold and silver are valuable.

305
00:17:46,064 --> 00:17:47,620
However, they're heavy as well.

306
00:17:47,748 --> 00:17:48,708
She doesn't like them.

307
00:17:48,736 --> 00:17:51,056
She said the hairpin would swing
if she put it on her hair.

308
00:17:51,088 --> 00:17:53,392
Her head would be heavier than
the rest of the body.

309
00:17:53,616 --> 00:17:55,136
She doesn't like gold or silver, huh?

310
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:56,133
She's just like me.

311
00:17:58,896 --> 00:18:01,616
She loves jade bangles. There's
a sense of spirituality about them.

312
00:18:02,357 --> 00:18:03,197
You're right.

313
00:18:03,536 --> 00:18:04,720
Have you written them down?

314
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,060
I have.

315
00:18:10,244 --> 00:18:11,045
Mother,

316
00:18:11,404 --> 00:18:13,000
this is your favorite white sugar cake.

317
00:18:17,348 --> 00:18:18,880
Duke Ying, you should try it too.

318
00:18:21,699 --> 00:18:22,499
Ning,

319
00:18:22,997 --> 00:18:23,836
I'll head back

320
00:18:23,988 --> 00:18:26,000
and prepare
another set of gifts for you.

321
00:18:26,081 --> 00:18:27,402
No need for that, Duke Ying.

322
00:18:27,584 --> 00:18:29,408
I've already
prepared everything for her.

323
00:18:29,424 --> 00:18:30,200
You can prepare yours

324
00:18:30,281 --> 00:18:31,521
while I can prepare mine.

325
00:18:32,029 --> 00:18:32,868
They're different.

326
00:18:33,731 --> 00:18:34,532
Wait here.

327
00:18:41,124 --> 00:18:42,004
Yining,

328
00:18:42,462 --> 00:18:44,942
this biological father of yours

329
00:18:45,566 --> 00:18:47,720
seems pretty nice.

330
00:18:48,188 --> 00:18:49,725
He does treat me well.

331
00:18:50,509 --> 00:18:51,373
However,

332
00:18:51,813 --> 00:18:53,360
maybe I'm not just used to it yet.

333
00:18:53,789 --> 00:18:55,600
Parents constitute
the foundation of a person.

334
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:57,217
Although it's a little late,

335
00:18:57,309 --> 00:18:59,120
it's worth cherishing
if it's true affection.

336
00:18:59,456 --> 00:19:01,800
Mother, you recited a verse
from Records of the Grand Historian.

337
00:19:03,069 --> 00:19:03,949
I think that book

338
00:19:04,029 --> 00:19:05,708
was kept inside
Second Master's room.

339
00:19:07,069 --> 00:19:08,880
You only left the residence
for a few days,

340
00:19:08,961 --> 00:19:11,000
and now, you're starting
to tease me, huh?

341
00:19:18,931 --> 00:19:21,040
First place in the imperial exam!

342
00:19:21,172 --> 00:19:24,132
Our new imperial scholar, Luo Shenyuan!

343
00:19:25,269 --> 00:19:26,628
First place in the imperial exam!

344
00:19:26,796 --> 00:19:29,475
Our new imperial scholar, Luo Shenyuan!

345
00:19:29,628 --> 00:19:31,120
First place in the imperial exam!

346
00:19:31,227 --> 00:19:33,587
Our new imperial scholar, Luo Shenyuan!

347
00:19:33,668 --> 00:19:35,308
First place in the imperial exam!

348
00:19:35,388 --> 00:19:38,388
Our new imperial scholar, Luo Shenyuan!

349
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,608
(Luo's Residence)

350
00:19:41,277 --> 00:19:42,277
Hairu,

351
00:19:42,749 --> 00:19:45,388
you've become the mother
of the imperial scholar.

352
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,920
Your son has finally
made a name for himself.

353
00:19:48,336 --> 00:19:49,700
Shenyuan is the triple top scorer.

354
00:19:49,728 --> 00:19:51,632
This is a joyous occasion
worth celebrating.

355
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:52,571
Rui Xiang.

356
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,117
Madam.

357
00:19:54,269 --> 00:19:55,480
Have all the musicians arrived?

358
00:19:55,488 --> 00:19:57,780
The musicians have been waiting
outside the palace long ago.

359
00:19:57,868 --> 00:19:58,828
Madam, don't worry.

360
00:19:58,952 --> 00:20:01,280
The entire capital will definitely
hear our songs of joy.

361
00:20:01,344 --> 00:20:03,040
- Give them additional rewards!
- Yes, Madam.

362
00:20:03,155 --> 00:20:04,148
Tell them to play

363
00:20:04,228 --> 00:20:05,388
with everything they have.

364
00:20:05,468 --> 00:20:06,268
Yes, Madam.

365
00:20:07,745 --> 00:20:08,785
Chengzhang.

366
00:20:10,507 --> 00:20:11,308
Yes, Mother?

367
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:12,636
Chengzhang,

368
00:20:13,269 --> 00:20:14,600
back then,

369
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:17,358
your father was merely
a double top scorer.

370
00:20:17,727 --> 00:20:19,687
He wasn't the top scorer
of the imperial exam.

371
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:21,751
Now, Shenyuan

372
00:20:22,118 --> 00:20:24,040
has fulfilled his dream on his behalf.

373
00:20:24,483 --> 00:20:25,880
He has brought honor to our family.

374
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:29,600
The future prosperity
of the Luo Family will depend on him.

375
00:20:29,881 --> 00:20:31,280
What I meant was

376
00:20:31,558 --> 00:20:32,936
that you should stop resenting

377
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,840
Shenyuan.

378
00:20:34,939 --> 00:20:35,880
I understand.

379
00:20:48,099 --> 00:20:50,400
Hurry! Let's go!

380
00:20:57,504 --> 00:20:59,230
So many people.
Are you here to rob money?

381
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:00,576
Or to check the imperial scholar out?

382
00:21:00,608 --> 00:21:01,780
Money can be found everywhere.

383
00:21:01,868 --> 00:21:03,042
But an imperial scholar

384
00:21:03,123 --> 00:21:04,563
as dashing as him is difficult to find.

385
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,100
Third Brother is over there!

386
00:21:19,618 --> 00:21:21,680
Look at all the musicians.

387
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,440
Congratulations, Third Brother.

388
00:22:07,470 --> 00:22:08,270
I'm here!

389
00:22:09,647 --> 00:22:10,514
My wife!

390
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,720
Third Brother,
everyone is looking at you.

391
00:22:18,829 --> 00:22:20,400
You should hurry and get on the horse.

392
00:22:25,147 --> 00:22:27,160
(The new imperial scholar,
Luo Shenyuan,)

393
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,192
(is mighty at the pen and the sword.
He's capable of undertaking tasks.)

394
00:22:30,228 --> 00:22:31,583
(His request shall be granted.)

395
00:22:31,584 --> 00:22:34,360
(He's to assume the position of minister
within Imperial Court of Judicial.)

396
00:22:34,789 --> 00:22:37,480
(He's received a special decree
to conduct case investigations.)

397
00:22:44,147 --> 00:22:44,986
Master,

398
00:22:46,172 --> 00:22:47,013
Senior Daoyan,

399
00:22:48,384 --> 00:22:50,256
with you two watching over us
from above,

400
00:22:50,288 --> 00:22:52,880
I shall fulfill my promise to you two.

401
00:23:21,148 --> 00:23:24,040
Greetings, Minister
of Imperial Court of Judicial.

402
00:23:25,675 --> 00:23:28,320
Congratulations on achieving your goal.

403
00:23:29,546 --> 00:23:30,907
Talk normally.

404
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:34,240
Third Brother, you secured a high
position after joining the officialdom.

405
00:23:34,702 --> 00:23:36,334
You've made an astonishing debut.

406
00:23:36,678 --> 00:23:38,160
It's just that the position

407
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,560
of Minister

408
00:23:39,706 --> 00:23:40,667
was what Father...

409
00:23:44,313 --> 00:23:46,400
I mean, Second Master
desires that position.

410
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:51,219
One's son is now his superior.

411
00:23:51,647 --> 00:23:53,960
This is strange indeed.

412
00:23:55,811 --> 00:23:57,840
You're mocking me, aren't you?

413
00:23:58,130 --> 00:23:59,560
That's not true.

414
00:24:02,256 --> 00:24:04,170
New officials are always
eager to make an impact.

415
00:24:04,259 --> 00:24:06,000
Third Brother, what do you plan to do?

416
00:24:08,419 --> 00:24:09,840
His Majesty is allowing

417
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,920
a young man like me
who has no influence or power

418
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:14,440
to assume such an important position.

419
00:24:15,489 --> 00:24:16,800
Why do you think he did so?

420
00:24:19,556 --> 00:24:21,520
So that he could hunt down the tiger?

421
00:24:23,538 --> 00:24:26,040
You've overestimated me.
That might not be the case.

422
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:28,040
But at least we know
that he's trying to lure

423
00:24:28,121 --> 00:24:28,975
the tiger out.

424
00:24:31,139 --> 00:24:33,280
If so, Third Brother,
what do you plan to do?

425
00:24:35,107 --> 00:24:36,080
If so,

426
00:24:36,532 --> 00:24:38,532
I shall behave like a crazed buffalo.

427
00:24:42,195 --> 00:24:43,034
It's late.

428
00:24:43,364 --> 00:24:44,604
Let me send you home first.

429
00:24:45,954 --> 00:24:46,794
No need for that.

430
00:24:47,156 --> 00:24:49,522
Qing Qu is waiting for me outside.

431
00:24:50,259 --> 00:24:51,419
I'll make a move first.

432
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,519
Seems like you've been
avoiding me lately.

433
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,199
That's not it.

434
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:03,760
I was just thinking

435
00:25:04,179 --> 00:25:06,000
that we're no longer siblings.

436
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:10,200
We can't do things the way we used to.

443

Third Brother,

444
00:25:38,667 --> 00:25:40,600
you'll be joining
the officialdom tomorrow.

445
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:43,080
You must be careful.

446
00:25:44,634 --> 00:25:45,434
I understand.

447
00:25:45,712 --> 00:25:47,160
The court is just like the battlefield.

448
00:25:48,006 --> 00:25:49,760
I'm afraid there'll be
many things that won't

449
00:25:49,841 --> 00:25:50,960
proceed according to my plan.

450
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,479
I don't want you to be a crazed buffalo.

451
00:25:54,827 --> 00:25:56,840
I just want you to be safe and sound.

452
00:25:58,477 --> 00:25:59,277
Yining,

453
00:25:59,951 --> 00:26:01,480
if, in the future,

454
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,688
I had no choice
but to go against my conscience,

455
00:26:04,848 --> 00:26:06,592
and everyone lost their trust in me,

456
00:26:06,656 --> 00:26:08,112
would you still believe me by then?

457
00:26:08,179 --> 00:26:09,179
Of course I would.

458
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:11,520
Third Brother,
there's always a valid reason

459
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:13,400
behind your every action.

460
00:26:16,459 --> 00:26:18,559
I heard that Duke Ying
would instruct his men

461
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,440
to deliver gifts to you
from time to time.

462
00:26:21,090 --> 00:26:21,960
He also hopes

463
00:26:22,256 --> 00:26:24,208
that you could return
to his residence soon.

464
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:27,000
He's nice to me indeed.

465
00:26:27,545 --> 00:26:29,600
But I have my own ideas.

466
00:26:29,859 --> 00:26:31,320
I wish to explore the world

467
00:26:31,443 --> 00:26:33,320
through my own efforts.

468
00:26:35,333 --> 00:26:36,360
But I've said this before.

469
00:26:37,179 --> 00:26:37,979
Yining,

470
00:26:39,337 --> 00:26:40,880
I'll protect you forever.

471
00:26:41,251 --> 00:26:43,827
In this life, I'll only be good to you.

472
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:45,600
That's not a casual remark.

473
00:26:49,466 --> 00:26:50,587
It's getting late.

474
00:26:51,161 --> 00:26:52,080
I've arrived home too.

475
00:26:52,673 --> 00:26:53,473
Okay.

476
00:26:53,809 --> 00:26:55,000
You should head back and rest.

477
00:26:57,327 --> 00:27:00,640
♪No regrets upon having you this life♪

478
00:27:00,764 --> 00:27:03,040
♪A double dream where both of us return♪

♪Looking forward to a life together♪

480

Shenyuan,

481
00:27:29,966 --> 00:27:31,480
you're finally here.

482
00:27:32,434 --> 00:27:34,200
Official Jiang,
thank you for receiving me.

483
00:27:34,522 --> 00:27:36,178
Please guide me

484
00:27:36,344 --> 00:27:37,280
in the future.

485
00:27:38,731 --> 00:27:40,553
Minister Luo,
also known as Top Scholar Luo,

486
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,064
I've long heard of your name.

487
00:27:42,992 --> 00:27:45,120
- A pleasure to meet you.
- A pleasure to meet you.

488
00:27:45,184 --> 00:27:46,352
I'm new to the department.

489
00:27:46,384 --> 00:27:48,090
Everyone, please guide me in the future.

490
00:27:48,242 --> 00:27:49,840
Minister Luo, you're too modest.

491
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,184
You're the newly appointed

492
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:53,320
top scholar by His Majesty.

493
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,840
You're His Majesty's student.

494
00:27:54,896 --> 00:27:57,160
Every department is fighting for
talented individuals now.

495
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:59,136
Since you've joined
Imperial Court of Judicial,

496
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:01,879
I can tell
that you're a pragmatic person.

497
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,840
Imperial Court of Judicial
oversees criminal justice

498
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,392
and upholds the national legal code.

499
00:28:05,579 --> 00:28:07,200
It's something
that I always wanted to do.

500
00:28:07,303 --> 00:28:08,131
Look at him. He does

501
00:28:08,212 --> 00:28:09,320
live up to be the top scholar.

502
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,760
The words he utters

503
00:28:11,889 --> 00:28:14,240
make us feel both embarrassed
and honored.

504
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:15,760
- Indeed.
- Indeed.

505
00:28:16,305 --> 00:28:17,106
Official Jiang.

506
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,560
I shall take Minister Luo

507
00:28:18,641 --> 00:28:20,122
around Imperial Court of Judicial

508
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,560
and introduce the personnel
and his duties to him.

509
00:28:22,641 --> 00:28:23,441
What do you think?

510
00:28:23,659 --> 00:28:24,459
All right.

511
00:28:25,056 --> 00:28:26,020
Thank you for the effort.

512
00:28:26,741 --> 00:28:27,700
Minister Luo, please.

513
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,999
Official Luo, over here, please.

514
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,357
Official Luo, come.

515
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:32,022
- Thank you.
- Official Luo, hurry.

516
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,140
Over here.

517
00:28:33,936 --> 00:28:35,339
Official Luo, over here.

518
00:28:35,419 --> 00:28:36,300
Mind your steps.

519
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:38,580
- Be careful. Let's go.
- Be careful.

520
00:28:47,584 --> 00:28:49,184
For case investigation documents,

521
00:28:49,232 --> 00:28:51,240
they're located on
the Tian rack and Di registers.

522
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,608
For detailed case analysis,

523
00:28:55,114 --> 00:28:57,080
they're located at Xuan rack
and Huang registers.

524
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,139
Hurry up.

525
00:29:00,226 --> 00:29:01,440
If not, our work won't end.

526
00:29:03,952 --> 00:29:05,400
Registrar Luo, sorry about that.

527
00:29:05,481 --> 00:29:06,772
I was careless.

528
00:29:07,073 --> 00:29:08,600
- Hurry and clean it!
- Yes, sir.

529
00:29:11,992 --> 00:29:12,920
Registrar Luo,

530
00:29:14,271 --> 00:29:16,600
although Minister Luo
assumed his position not long ago,

531
00:29:16,833 --> 00:29:17,712
he's requesting

532
00:29:17,792 --> 00:29:19,320
the records of old cases.

533
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,720
Seems like he's trying
to do something big here.

534
00:29:21,998 --> 00:29:23,160
How would I know

535
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:24,560
what the minister intends to do?

536
00:29:24,561 --> 00:29:25,440
But...

537
00:29:26,386 --> 00:29:28,000
Isn't he your son?

538
00:29:30,616 --> 00:29:32,080
There's no kinship in workplaces.

539
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:34,832
We just need to fulfill our duty
and deal with the records.

540
00:29:35,303 --> 00:29:36,480
What's with all the questions?

541
00:29:39,417 --> 00:29:40,320
Hurry.

542
00:29:40,756 --> 00:29:41,680
Yes, sir.

543
00:29:42,936 --> 00:29:44,905
(Luo's Residence)

544
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,240
What's wrong again?

545
00:29:53,344 --> 00:29:54,720
You're pulling a long face again.

546
00:29:55,779 --> 00:29:57,200
Did someone offend you?

547
00:29:58,889 --> 00:30:00,240
Mother, I'm fine.

548
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,928
I'm just exhausted.

549
00:30:02,331 --> 00:30:03,480
You should rest well, then.

550
00:30:05,641 --> 00:30:06,480
Shenyuan,

551
00:30:07,384 --> 00:30:09,640
this chicken tofu dish
is tender and smooth.

552
00:30:09,721 --> 00:30:10,880
I made it especially for you.

553
00:30:10,912 --> 00:30:13,390
Today's your first day of work.
It must've been tough. Eat up.

554
00:30:13,472 --> 00:30:14,312
Thank you, Mother.

555
00:30:16,376 --> 00:30:17,176
My dear,

556
00:30:18,223 --> 00:30:19,904
why are you sighing again?

557
00:30:22,817 --> 00:30:24,097
Father loves this dish as well.

558
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,824
Father, you should have it first.

559
00:30:33,610 --> 00:30:34,616
Shenyuan,

560
00:30:35,163 --> 00:30:36,840
you just joined
Imperial Court of Judicial.

561
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:38,510
Can you get used
to the environment there?

562
00:30:39,232 --> 00:30:40,400
Yeah, I can.

563
00:30:42,248 --> 00:30:43,280
What do you mean by that?

564
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,400
Shenyuan,

565
00:30:46,337 --> 00:30:47,800
you just assumed your position,

566
00:30:47,856 --> 00:30:49,696
and you're investigating
all those old cases.

567
00:30:49,728 --> 00:30:51,712
You're completely unaware
of what you're doing.

568
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,340
Father, you had to flip through
all those files and documents.

569
00:30:55,376 --> 00:30:56,784
It must've been tough indeed.

570
00:30:57,303 --> 00:30:58,480
Father, if you're exhausted,

571
00:30:59,312 --> 00:31:00,792
I'll send someone else to do your work.

572
00:31:03,704 --> 00:31:05,305
Do you think I'm angry because of that?

573
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:10,560
We're having a meal here.
Why are you guys talking about work?

574
00:31:11,233 --> 00:31:12,153
Let's eat.

575
00:31:13,709 --> 00:31:14,840
Shenyuan,

576
00:31:14,969 --> 00:31:16,080
you must remember this.

577
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,840
You're working diligently
because you've just

578
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,910
entered the officialdom.

579
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:20,512
You must act according
to your abilities.

580
00:31:20,668 --> 00:31:21,468
Yes, Grandma.

581
00:31:24,744 --> 00:31:25,544
Young Lady,

582
00:31:25,913 --> 00:31:27,952
we've already visited
several rouge stalls.

583
00:31:28,154 --> 00:31:29,640
Have you noticed anything unusual?

584
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,748
Their products
aren't as good as the ones we sell.

585
00:31:33,273 --> 00:31:34,760
Now, Yanrong Pavilion

586
00:31:34,834 --> 00:31:35,794
just needs an opportunity

587
00:31:35,875 --> 00:31:37,155
to let everyone know about us.

588
00:31:39,074 --> 00:31:40,520
What should we do, then?

589
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:42,880
We cannot be impatient.

590
00:31:43,136 --> 00:31:45,440
We have to wait for a good timing.

591
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:49,553
- Qing Qu, are you okay?
- My purse!

592
00:31:49,905 --> 00:31:50,840
There's a thief!

593
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,873
(Liuhe Tavern)

594
00:32:10,512 --> 00:32:12,410
Young Master,
we've searched the surrounding area

595
00:32:12,448 --> 00:32:14,350
- where Seventh Lady went missing.
- How did it go?

596
00:32:14,352 --> 00:32:15,560
There were Imperial Guards

597
00:32:15,634 --> 00:32:16,833
guarding the nearby junctions.

598
00:32:16,913 --> 00:32:18,139
They should be Lu Jiaxue's men.

599
00:32:18,273 --> 00:32:19,394
Lu Jiaxue's men, huh?

600
00:32:19,936 --> 00:32:21,088
Has he made any unusual moves?

601
00:32:21,097 --> 00:32:22,296
He wasn't up to anything major.

602
00:32:22,352 --> 00:32:23,360
It's just that he released

603
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:25,264
a criminal from prison suddenly
a few days ago.

604
00:32:26,192 --> 00:32:27,112
Tell our men to locate

605
00:32:27,209 --> 00:32:28,600
Lu Jiaxue with everything they have.

606
00:32:28,681 --> 00:32:30,002
We have to find Yining.

607
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:31,600
- Yes, Young Master.
- Yes, Young Master.

608
00:32:37,216 --> 00:32:39,152
I've been waiting for you for many days.

609
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:43,520
You were finally walking
all by yourself today.

610
00:32:43,784 --> 00:32:44,920
Who exactly are you?

611
00:32:45,376 --> 00:32:46,480
Why did you kidnap me?

612
00:32:56,184 --> 00:32:58,760
What? We were once close friends.

613
00:32:58,896 --> 00:33:00,544
Do you not recognize me anymore?

614
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:01,640
Song Ziyun?

615
00:33:02,262 --> 00:33:03,320
What do you want?

616
00:33:04,225 --> 00:33:05,675
Xu Mei, I never expected

617
00:33:05,756 --> 00:33:07,600
a wretch like you to be still alive.

618
00:33:08,433 --> 00:33:10,240
Not only are you alive,

619
00:33:10,672 --> 00:33:12,480
but you also became Duke Ying's
daughter, huh?

620
00:33:13,052 --> 00:33:16,360
The heavens are unfair indeed.

621
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,400
The Song Family wouldn't have

622
00:33:20,481 --> 00:33:22,200
been shattered if it weren't for you!

623
00:33:22,281 --> 00:33:23,153
Why would I end up

624
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,150
in such a pathetic state

625
00:33:24,154 --> 00:33:25,160
if it weren't for

626
00:33:25,241 --> 00:33:26,920
what you did back then?

627
00:33:27,593 --> 00:33:28,840
It's all because of you!

628
00:33:30,943 --> 00:33:32,440
I could never figure out

629
00:33:33,413 --> 00:33:34,793
why Lu Jiaxue

630
00:33:34,874 --> 00:33:36,800
would fall for a village girl like you.

631
00:33:38,672 --> 00:33:39,472
That's why

632
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,480
I located you without his knowledge,

633
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,480
and told you

634
00:33:45,224 --> 00:33:47,280
that he sent me here to get rid of you.

635
00:33:48,273 --> 00:33:49,616
I never expected you

636
00:33:49,697 --> 00:33:51,000
to be foolish enough to fall for it.

637
00:33:51,267 --> 00:33:52,160
You idiot.

638
00:33:54,428 --> 00:33:55,280
So, it was you.

639
00:33:55,361 --> 00:33:56,161
That's right.

640
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:58,160
I thought Lu Jiaxue

641
00:33:58,795 --> 00:34:01,040
would be faithful to me
after you were gone.

642
00:34:01,444 --> 00:34:02,314
I never expected him

643
00:34:02,394 --> 00:34:04,440
to repay my kindness with hostility
for your sake!

644
00:34:04,521 --> 00:34:06,480
He murdered my entire family!

645
00:34:09,608 --> 00:34:10,600
You're wrong.

646
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:13,960
He didn't do it for my sake.

647
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:16,400
He did it for his sake.

648
00:34:18,319 --> 00:34:20,400
He approached you
in order to gain power.

649
00:34:20,973 --> 00:34:22,160
He ruined your family

650
00:34:22,952 --> 00:34:24,760
to obtain greater power.

651
00:34:29,873 --> 00:34:31,560
What did you say?

652
00:34:36,975 --> 00:34:38,560
To think that Lu Jiaxue

653
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:39,960
had this day coming to him, huh?

654
00:34:40,975 --> 00:34:41,960
His beloved

655
00:34:42,041 --> 00:34:43,880
actually despises him.

656
00:34:45,233 --> 00:34:46,033
Great.

657
00:34:47,326 --> 00:34:48,200
Great!

658
00:34:48,787 --> 00:34:49,897
This is great!

659
00:34:56,064 --> 00:34:58,240
Do you think I'll release you
just because you said that?

660
00:35:00,514 --> 00:35:02,680
Since he fancies you so much

661
00:35:02,833 --> 00:35:05,560
and he treats you as his precious gem,

662
00:35:06,319 --> 00:35:07,514
I have no choice but to let him

663
00:35:07,595 --> 00:35:08,880
experience the same pain again.

664
00:35:14,239 --> 00:35:15,160
Lu Jiaxue!

665
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:16,553
What now?

666
00:35:16,983 --> 00:35:18,720
Do you want to kill me now?

667
00:35:18,833 --> 00:35:19,673
Will you kill me?

668
00:35:20,809 --> 00:35:21,649
Song Ziyun,

669
00:35:22,336 --> 00:35:24,000
you should know what's good for you.

670
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,080
I'll tell my men to send you back.

671
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:29,344
Find a good husband and
lead a good life after this.

672
00:35:29,392 --> 00:35:30,672
It's time for you to let go.

673
00:35:34,474 --> 00:35:35,274
Mei,

674
00:35:35,555 --> 00:35:36,355
are you okay?

675
00:35:37,328 --> 00:35:38,480
You finally acknowledged

676
00:35:38,753 --> 00:35:39,720
that you're Mei.

677
00:35:40,289 --> 00:35:41,890
- Mei!
- Let go of me!

678
00:35:45,984 --> 00:35:47,053
Let go of me!

679
00:35:53,664 --> 00:35:54,840
You weren't hurt, were you?

680
00:36:01,136 --> 00:36:02,880
Song Ziyun was too bold
for her own good.

681
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,608
She harmed you behind my back before.

682
00:36:04,624 --> 00:36:06,096
And she's trying to do the same thing.

683
00:36:06,241 --> 00:36:07,400
She's despicable indeed.

684
00:36:08,474 --> 00:36:09,560
But don't worry.

685
00:36:10,025 --> 00:36:10,985
As long as I'm around,

686
00:36:11,458 --> 00:36:12,538
I won't

687
00:36:12,656 --> 00:36:13,720
let this happen again.

688
00:36:15,288 --> 00:36:16,088
Mei,

689
00:36:16,673 --> 00:36:17,954
since you already know

690
00:36:17,968 --> 00:36:19,648
that everything was a misunderstanding,

691
00:36:20,318 --> 00:36:21,238
could you please

692
00:36:22,345 --> 00:36:23,665
return to my side?

693
00:36:24,985 --> 00:36:26,465
Song Ziyun appeared before me

694
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,520
thanks to your arrangement, right?

695
00:36:30,384 --> 00:36:31,568
If not, there's no way

696
00:36:31,634 --> 00:36:33,193
you can make such a timely appearance.

697
00:36:40,003 --> 00:36:40,803
Yes.

698
00:36:41,272 --> 00:36:43,433
I only wanted her to explain

699
00:36:43,514 --> 00:36:44,673
what happened between us.

700
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,239
When I found out

701
00:36:46,288 --> 00:36:48,112
that you were the one
who jumped off the cliff,

702
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:49,039
I regretted my actions.

703
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:49,920
Lu Jiaxue,

704
00:36:50,389 --> 00:36:52,160
why would she come and harm me

705
00:36:52,672 --> 00:36:54,240
if you didn't approach
the Song Family?

706
00:36:55,273 --> 00:36:56,520
I know you still hate me for it.

707
00:36:58,034 --> 00:36:59,833
But I had no choice back then.

708
00:37:00,662 --> 00:37:01,462
Now,

709
00:37:01,914 --> 00:37:03,360
since you already knew the truth,

710
00:37:04,313 --> 00:37:05,880
can't you give me another chance

711
00:37:06,073 --> 00:37:06,953
and forgive me?

712
00:37:10,976 --> 00:37:13,120
Everyone who's useful to you
can be manipulated.

713
00:37:13,568 --> 00:37:15,776
Everyone who's useless to you
can be killed off.

714
00:37:17,024 --> 00:37:18,580
You'll pay the price of committing

715
00:37:18,665 --> 00:37:20,647
all these dirty deeds
to get to where you are today.

716
00:37:21,464 --> 00:37:23,303
For all the influence and power
you've obtained,

717
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,400
you'll definitely have
corresponding losses.

718
00:37:28,209 --> 00:37:29,360
But my feelings for you

719
00:37:30,315 --> 00:37:31,355
were never fake.

720
00:37:33,711 --> 00:37:34,720
Did you forget

721
00:37:35,367 --> 00:37:37,680
the days we first knew each other?

722
00:37:41,522 --> 00:37:42,800
It feels scary precisely because

723
00:37:43,869 --> 00:37:44,960
I couldn't forget it.

724
00:37:47,552 --> 00:37:49,024
The one whom I've treated

725
00:37:49,496 --> 00:37:51,000
with all my heart before this,

726
00:37:52,248 --> 00:37:54,080
put me in danger
on numerous occasions

727
00:37:54,682 --> 00:37:56,323
for the sake of influence and power.

728
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,920
And now, he's setting me up
just so he could

729
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:00,640
make me
reveal my true identity.

730
00:38:01,889 --> 00:38:02,689
Mei,

731
00:38:04,023 --> 00:38:05,560
I've never sold myself out for glory.

732
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,560
I will never put you in danger.

733
00:38:08,944 --> 00:38:10,220
No matter if it's right, wrong,

734
00:38:10,303 --> 00:38:12,440
true, or false, it no longer matters.

735
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:15,840
We don't belong in the same world.

736
00:38:19,207 --> 00:38:20,007
Stop the carriage.

737
00:38:22,585 --> 00:38:23,905
Marquis Lu, what are you doing?

738
00:38:25,096 --> 00:38:25,896
Lu Jiaxue,

739
00:38:26,231 --> 00:38:27,032
don't tell me

740
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,640
you're going to abduct me?

741
00:38:30,977 --> 00:38:31,777
Stop the carriage!

742
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,420
Third Brother?

743
00:38:37,294 --> 00:38:38,320
Let go of me!

744
00:38:44,986 --> 00:38:45,786
Your Lordship,

745
00:38:46,326 --> 00:38:47,760
I'm here to pick my sister up.

746
00:38:48,223 --> 00:38:49,280
Please release her.

747
00:38:49,871 --> 00:38:50,672
Third Brother!

748
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:58,123
Minister Luo,

749
00:38:58,204 --> 00:38:59,320
you're quite resourceful.

750
00:38:59,803 --> 00:39:02,642
But, you're just a lowly minister
of Imperial Court of Judicial.

751
00:39:03,768 --> 00:39:05,320
How dare you stop my carriage?

752
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,399
I'm not wearing my uniform.
I came here on my horse alone.

753
00:39:08,504 --> 00:39:10,378
I came here to pick my sister up
as her brother.

754
00:39:10,416 --> 00:39:11,408
How is that unreasonable?

755
00:39:15,177 --> 00:39:16,480
What if I don't release her?

756
00:39:17,472 --> 00:39:19,610
If so, I have no choice but
to report this to Duke Ying.

757
00:39:19,616 --> 00:39:21,200
If he hears about this,

758
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,600
he'll definitely surround

759
00:39:22,685 --> 00:39:23,783
your residence

760
00:39:23,863 --> 00:39:25,038
with his heavy cavalries.

761
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:25,919
If that happens,

762
00:39:26,226 --> 00:39:27,640
it'll be embarrassing for everyone.

763
00:39:27,892 --> 00:39:28,692
Third Brother!

764
00:39:34,031 --> 00:39:34,831
Be careful.

765
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:36,860
Mei.

766
00:39:40,773 --> 00:39:42,280
This affair was over long ago.

767
00:39:42,448 --> 00:39:44,320
You should stop dwelling
on the past as well.

768
00:39:47,054 --> 00:39:48,134
Third Brother, let's go.

769
00:40:00,897 --> 00:40:01,863
Are you sure you're fine?

770
00:40:01,984 --> 00:40:03,498
What exactly was Lu Jiaxue up to?

771
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,480
He was merely using Song Ziyun

772
00:40:05,664 --> 00:40:07,436
to force me to admit that I'm Mei.

773
00:40:08,279 --> 00:40:09,240
Song Ziyun?

774
00:40:09,696 --> 00:40:11,376
You mean Song Yingshan's granddaughter?

775
00:40:11,472 --> 00:40:12,150
That's right.

776
00:40:13,104 --> 00:40:13,944
No matter what,

777
00:40:14,024 --> 00:40:15,320
now, we are strangers to each other.

778
00:40:15,624 --> 00:40:17,440
I won't change my mind for his sake.

779
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,110
Young Lady, we've searched
where Song Ziyun

780
00:40:23,136 --> 00:40:24,430
sought refuge for the past few days.

781
00:40:24,584 --> 00:40:25,905
We found this in the corner.

782
00:40:31,092 --> 00:40:32,143
What exactly is this,

783
00:40:32,224 --> 00:40:33,024
Young Master?

784
00:40:34,008 --> 00:40:35,040
This might be the other half

785
00:40:35,121 --> 00:40:36,401
of the Song Family's ledger.

786
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:38,384
Give it to Senior Xia Yong.

787
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,000
Yes, Young Master.

788
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,628
(Spring Festival Eve)

789
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:47,360
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

790
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:52,689
Greetings, Duke Ying.

791
00:40:53,681 --> 00:40:54,481
Where's Yining?

792
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:58,000
Please head to the back.

793
00:41:11,897 --> 00:41:12,856
You're here.

794
00:41:13,289 --> 00:41:14,089
Yining.

795
00:41:17,529 --> 00:41:18,960
I was passing by.

796
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:20,624
Therefore, I came to visit you.

797
00:41:24,832 --> 00:41:26,700
You're already putting up
the lanterns, huh?

798
00:41:27,534 --> 00:41:28,334
Excellent.

799
00:41:28,783 --> 00:41:29,584
They look great.

800
00:41:32,432 --> 00:41:34,496
My daughter's handwriting
is pretty good as well.

801
00:41:34,816 --> 00:41:36,416
The strokes are robust and powerful.

802
00:41:36,575 --> 00:41:37,920
Third Brother wrote them.

803
00:41:41,487 --> 00:41:42,287
No wonder.

804
00:41:42,496 --> 00:41:44,800
I could tell that it was
a man's handwriting at first glance.

805
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,199
It's almost Chinese New Year.

806
00:41:49,441 --> 00:41:51,160
How is the weather still so hot?

807
00:41:51,401 --> 00:41:52,360
Please have a seat.

808
00:42:01,449 --> 00:42:03,400
Yining, what do you like

809
00:42:03,481 --> 00:42:04,488
to eat usually?

810
00:42:05,584 --> 00:42:07,024
I'll instruct the cooks at my residence

811
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:08,808
to prepare and deliver them to you.

812
00:42:08,953 --> 00:42:09,753
Okay?

813
00:42:10,672 --> 00:42:12,304
Please spare yourself from the trouble.

814
00:42:12,423 --> 00:42:14,102
Both of my maids,
Qing Qu and Xue Zhi,

815
00:42:14,183 --> 00:42:15,360
know how to cook.

816
00:42:15,664 --> 00:42:17,295
And, the taverns nearby

817
00:42:17,376 --> 00:42:18,640
sell every dish we can think of.

818
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:19,780
That's good.

819
00:42:20,664 --> 00:42:21,480
That's good too.

820
00:42:26,223 --> 00:42:27,600
Do you like fireworks?

821
00:42:28,370 --> 00:42:29,229
The palace delivered

822
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:30,800
plenty of fireworks to me
a few days ago.

823
00:42:30,832 --> 00:42:32,220
They said the fireworks are beautiful.

824
00:42:32,224 --> 00:42:33,410
But no one in the residence

825
00:42:33,528 --> 00:42:34,520
dare to set them.

826
00:42:36,129 --> 00:42:37,280
Do you want some?

827
00:42:42,263 --> 00:42:43,520
Please cut to the chase

828
00:42:43,753 --> 00:42:44,960
if you have something to say.

829
00:42:48,064 --> 00:42:49,120
I'll cut to the chase, then.

830
00:42:51,016 --> 00:42:52,600
You see, it's almost Chinese New Year.

831
00:42:53,215 --> 00:42:54,280
Can you join us

832
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:58,480
for the reunion dinner?

833
00:42:59,024 --> 00:43:00,672
You can spend some time
with your grandma

834
00:43:00,736 --> 00:43:03,000
and siblings as well.

835
00:43:03,328 --> 00:43:05,232
They told me about it
on numerous occasions.

836
00:43:05,352 --> 00:43:06,960
They wish to reunite with you as well.

837
00:43:07,248 --> 00:43:08,048
Okay?

838
00:43:08,112 --> 00:43:09,312
You can stay at our residence

839
00:43:09,327 --> 00:43:10,640
for a few more days

840
00:43:10,855 --> 00:43:12,480
after the reunion dinner.

841
00:43:14,847 --> 00:43:15,648
Of course,

842
00:43:16,024 --> 00:43:17,184
if you don't like it there,

843
00:43:17,343 --> 00:43:18,560
you may come back at any time.

844
00:43:18,928 --> 00:43:20,992
You don't need to answer me immediately.

845
00:43:21,088 --> 00:43:22,110
You can take your time.

846
00:43:22,624 --> 00:43:24,464
I'm in no rush.

847
00:43:24,656 --> 00:43:26,224
I have official affairs to attend to.

848
00:43:26,375 --> 00:43:27,280
I'll make a move first.

849
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,880
I'm willing to head back.

850
00:43:38,992 --> 00:43:40,912
If so, I'll head back
and prepare for it.

851
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:49,472
Don't go back on your word, okay?
