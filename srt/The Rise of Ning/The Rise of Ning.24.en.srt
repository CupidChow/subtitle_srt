00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,400
=The Rise of Ning=

2
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,320
(Adapted from Wen Tan's novel "Chancellor
Training Handbook" from Jinjiang Literature)

3
00:01:36,681 --> 00:01:38,853
=Episode 24=

4
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,923
(Marquis Anbei's Residence)

5
00:01:57,353 --> 00:01:59,713
Uncle, it's almost time.

6
00:02:21,913 --> 00:02:22,753
How did it go?

7
00:02:22,994 --> 00:02:23,794
Young Lady,

8
00:02:24,074 --> 00:02:26,234
Third Young Master
didn't go to the library today.

9
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,430
(Jimo House)

10
00:02:31,433 --> 00:02:33,593
It's late.
Why hasn't Third Brother returned yet?

11
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:36,153
Young Master went to Mr. Sun's library.

12
00:02:36,153 --> 00:02:37,033
He hasn't returned yet.

13
00:02:37,033 --> 00:02:38,554
Qing Qu and I have been there.

14
00:02:38,954 --> 00:02:39,913
He wasn't there at all.

15
00:02:40,153 --> 00:02:41,873
Maybe Qing Qu was mistaken.

16
00:02:42,354 --> 00:02:42,873
Fine.

17
00:02:43,274 --> 00:02:44,593
Follow me to the library, then.

18
00:02:44,593 --> 00:02:45,994
It's either Qing Qu was mistaken

19
00:02:45,994 --> 00:02:47,074
or you're lying to me.

20
00:02:47,954 --> 00:02:48,753
Seventh Lady,

21
00:02:48,794 --> 00:02:51,071
Young Master has been busy lately.

22
00:02:51,072 --> 00:02:52,850
Is he so busy
that he has no time to come home?

23
00:02:53,394 --> 00:02:55,633
It's common for men
to experience this when they're busy.

24
00:02:57,913 --> 00:02:59,234
Was he busy with

25
00:02:59,234 --> 00:03:00,749
the affairs of Senior Daoyan?

26
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,032
Seventh Lady, how did you know...?

27
00:03:02,354 --> 00:03:03,753
Now, I know.

28
00:03:04,834 --> 00:03:06,193
Tell me where he is.

29
00:03:08,074 --> 00:03:10,389
He'll slaughter me if I tell you.

30
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,256
I'll slaughter you right now
if you don't tell me.

31
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,872
Young Master said

32
00:03:14,873 --> 00:03:17,114
he would definitely try his best
to come back in one piece.

33
00:03:17,954 --> 00:03:19,074
Come back in one piece?

34
00:03:22,394 --> 00:03:23,313
Explain yourself!

35
00:04:15,794 --> 00:04:17,229
All of them are his men.

36
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:19,264
He's staging the act himself.
What a shameless man.

37
00:04:23,873 --> 00:04:24,953
Protect His Lordship!

38
00:04:25,234 --> 00:04:25,714
Yes, sir!

39
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:29,952
Someone's trying to rescue the convict.

40
00:04:29,994 --> 00:04:31,034
Kill all of them!

41
00:04:33,056 --> 00:04:34,528
Lu Jiaxue is going to make his move.

42
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:35,073
Let's go.

43
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:42,910
(Laifu Inn)

44
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:44,790
(Zuixian Restaurant)

45
00:04:46,193 --> 00:04:46,794
Here they come.

46
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,040
(Chen Daoyan is in danger)

47
00:05:13,433 --> 00:05:17,034
Don't come! Just go!

48
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,200
(Longquan)

49
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:33,919
(Yining,)

50
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,624
(I would rather
you didn't come upon this letter.)

51
00:05:37,008 --> 00:05:38,688
(If you're reading this right now,)

52
00:05:38,753 --> 00:05:41,114
(I'm sorry. I went back on my word.)

53
00:05:42,554 --> 00:05:44,433
(I made a vow in front
of Master's grave.)

54
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:46,794
(I swore to look after
my seniors and juniors.)

55
00:05:47,073 --> 00:05:47,873
(I know)

56
00:05:48,554 --> 00:05:49,914
(you still can't get over)

57
00:05:50,034 --> 00:05:51,354
(your mother's death.)

58
00:05:52,384 --> 00:05:54,023
(What worries me the most)

59
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,200
(is the matter
between you and Chen Lan.)

60
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:58,657
(You can seek the help
of my brothers in the trading house.)

61
00:05:59,137 --> 00:06:00,457
(All of them are at your disposal.)

62
00:06:00,816 --> 00:06:02,290
(You can move out of Luo's Residence)

63
00:06:02,336 --> 00:06:03,872
(and stay away from trouble as well.)

64
00:06:04,856 --> 00:06:06,056
(Take good care of yourself.)

65
00:06:06,577 --> 00:06:08,856
(If not, I cannot rest in peace.)

66
00:06:10,097 --> 00:06:12,697
(All humans die eventually.)

67
00:06:12,928 --> 00:06:14,570
(There's no need to rejoice
over happiness)

68
00:06:14,856 --> 00:06:17,257
(or grieve over tragedy.)

69
00:06:17,817 --> 00:06:19,577
(I don't expect you to forgive me.)

70
00:06:19,777 --> 00:06:20,976
(I'll make a move first.)

71
00:06:21,344 --> 00:06:23,680
(I just hope that you'll lead
a better life in the future.)

72
00:06:23,976 --> 00:06:25,097
(If, one day,)

73
00:06:25,376 --> 00:06:26,897
(everyone in the world condemns you,)

74
00:06:27,296 --> 00:06:29,536
(and there's no place for you to stay,)

75
00:06:29,897 --> 00:06:31,176
(you don't need to be upset.)

76
00:06:31,456 --> 00:06:32,848
(You can admire the date trees,)

77
00:06:32,897 --> 00:06:34,176
(and the ginkgo trees during fall.)

78
00:06:34,296 --> 00:06:36,496
(That's the kind of life
you always desired.)

79
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:37,856
(You should live on)

80
00:06:38,137 --> 00:06:39,337
(for my sake as well.)

81
00:06:39,817 --> 00:06:41,817
(Yining, take care.)

82
00:06:46,729 --> 00:06:47,729
What are you doing here?

83
00:06:47,777 --> 00:06:48,657
Just go!

84
00:06:49,402 --> 00:06:50,402
Duke Ying is coming!

85
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,328
You'll be safe by then!

86
00:08:26,785 --> 00:08:27,586
Young Master Cheng.

87
00:08:27,649 --> 00:08:28,928
Duke Ying's men have arrived.

88
00:09:08,761 --> 00:09:09,560
Nobody moves!

89
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,759
Put down your weapons.

90
00:09:20,976 --> 00:09:23,776
If not, he shall die.

91
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,959
I know who you are.

92
00:09:30,514 --> 00:09:31,715
Just surrender.

93
00:09:43,256 --> 00:09:44,057
Stop right there!

94
00:09:47,385 --> 00:09:48,184
Lu Jiaxue,

95
00:09:48,456 --> 00:09:49,816
you're bold, aren't you?

96
00:09:49,904 --> 00:09:52,224
How dare you plot to harm
a major criminal of the court?

97
00:09:52,569 --> 00:09:53,770
Put down your weapon!

98
00:10:00,177 --> 00:10:01,136
Lu Jiaxue.

99
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:04,128
I'll see how you can
explain yourself now.

100
00:10:33,856 --> 00:10:34,697
Hurry.

101
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:38,297
Just go.

102
00:11:17,697 --> 00:11:18,457
Attack!

103
00:11:24,128 --> 00:11:25,088
Get out of the way!

104
00:11:33,297 --> 00:11:34,177
Get out of the way!

105
00:11:38,896 --> 00:11:39,697
Marquis Lu.

106
00:11:42,016 --> 00:11:43,616
Follow me to see His Majesty.

107
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:45,274
Explain yourself to him.

108
00:11:46,882 --> 00:11:47,681
Duke Ying,

109
00:11:48,649 --> 00:11:50,090
I'm trying to arrest the criminals now.

110
00:11:50,331 --> 00:11:52,172
I'll definitely explain myself
after this.

111
00:11:52,616 --> 00:11:53,376
Fine.

112
00:11:54,057 --> 00:11:54,976
I'll wait for you.

113
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,090
I'll see whether
it was a true assassination

114
00:11:57,136 --> 00:11:58,850
or just an act
that you set up by yourself.

115
00:11:59,056 --> 00:12:01,370
I'll see how you can explain yourself
in front of His Majesty.

116
00:12:01,568 --> 00:12:02,528
Regarding today's matter,

117
00:12:03,057 --> 00:12:03,817
the Imperial Guards

118
00:12:03,962 --> 00:12:05,322
will give His Majesty an account.

119
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:08,559
Let's go.

120
00:12:33,297 --> 00:12:34,097
Seventh Lady.

121
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:47,159
It's me. What do you need?

122
00:12:47,408 --> 00:12:48,670
You're being so protective of him.

123
00:12:49,318 --> 00:12:50,279
Why don't we guess

124
00:12:50,544 --> 00:12:52,320
whether or not
he'll come to your rescue?

125
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:52,999
Him?

126
00:12:53,616 --> 00:12:54,896
Who are you referring to?

127
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:56,558
Young Master.

128
00:12:56,848 --> 00:12:57,696
How's the situation?

129
00:12:57,776 --> 00:12:58,416
Take a look.

130
00:13:01,159 --> 00:13:03,519
I just came here to have some tea.

131
00:13:03,678 --> 00:13:05,478
My maid went
to do some shopping for me.

132
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,078
I ran outside as I saw a riot

133
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:08,078
breaking out downstairs.

134
00:13:08,144 --> 00:13:09,552
Is there something wrong with that?

135
00:13:11,438 --> 00:13:12,838
But it seems like you're exhausted

136
00:13:12,838 --> 00:13:13,919
from merely having tea.

137
00:13:15,808 --> 00:13:18,224
Your third brother always
says that he'll protect you.

138
00:13:18,448 --> 00:13:20,630
But now, it doesn't seem like
he cares about you at all.

139
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:25,678
Third Brother?

140
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:28,958
Is this case
related to Third Brother as well?

141
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:30,176
You still want to deny the fact?

142
00:13:30,198 --> 00:13:31,198
Fine.

143
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,350
Be careful. There's a river behind you.

144
00:13:38,239 --> 00:13:39,039
Seventh Lady,

145
00:13:39,598 --> 00:13:40,798
what if I try to kill you today?

146
00:13:42,176 --> 00:13:43,712
Do you think he'll come to your rescue?

147
00:13:43,759 --> 00:13:45,078
How dare you threaten me

148
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:46,598
in public?

149
00:13:47,438 --> 00:13:48,718
Do you have any regard for the law?

150
00:13:48,718 --> 00:13:49,279
Shut up!

151
00:13:52,318 --> 00:13:53,678
Are you all

152
00:13:54,078 --> 00:13:55,678
just cowards who hide in the shadows?

153
00:13:56,064 --> 00:13:57,648
You guys should head back first.

154
00:13:57,696 --> 00:13:59,099
No. Young Master, you mustn't go.

155
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,480
He predicted where you would be hiding.

156
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,680
He's luring you out on purpose.

157
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,540
I have to save her.

158
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,830
If you show yourself like this,

159
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:05,232
Lu Jiaxue will have the goods on us.

160
00:14:05,232 --> 00:14:06,550
If Seventh Lady is one of us,

161
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:08,128
she cannot
clear her name in the future.

162
00:14:08,192 --> 00:14:09,150
If you show yourself now,

163
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,599
not only will Seventh Lady
die from it,

164
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,304
but the entire Luo Family
will be implicated.

165
00:14:12,336 --> 00:14:13,310
Calm down for now.

166
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,830
Lu Jiaxue has never seen me before.

167
00:14:14,838 --> 00:14:16,558
I'm not related
to the Luo Family either.

168
00:14:16,598 --> 00:14:17,558
Even if they capture me,

169
00:14:17,558 --> 00:14:18,879
at most, I'll say that I can't watch

170
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,838
them bullying a girl.

171
00:14:19,904 --> 00:14:21,008
You should head back first.

172
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,240
I'll rescue her with our seniors.

173
00:14:22,288 --> 00:14:22,640
Let's go!

174
00:14:27,952 --> 00:14:29,888
You guys still don't want
to show yourselves?

175
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,912
How dare you guys let a weak girl
like her provide cover for you all?

176
00:14:32,976 --> 00:14:34,128
Aren't you guys embarrassed?

177
00:14:34,798 --> 00:14:36,198
Do you guys want her to die?

178
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:41,879
Even if

179
00:14:42,999 --> 00:14:44,318
I were to die again today,

180
00:14:45,408 --> 00:14:46,630
I won't let you hold me hostage

181
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,478
and blackmail Third Brother.

182
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:32,718
Young Lady!

183
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:38,359
Young Lady, you're awake.

184
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,078
What am I doing here?

185
00:15:43,078 --> 00:15:44,159
Don't you remember?

186
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,039
Third Young Master sent you back.

187
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:47,239
He said you fell into the river.

188
00:15:47,359 --> 00:15:49,039
All of the servants were terrified.

189
00:15:49,119 --> 00:15:50,438
It didn't alarm anyone, did it?

190
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:53,078
Both Old Madam and Madam Lin
have no idea.

191
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:55,239
I'm glad to hear that.

Third Young Master instructed his men
to deliver medicine here.

201
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,239

tell him

208
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,718
to take his things with him.

209
00:17:10,159 --> 00:17:11,559
I don't wish to see him again.

210
00:17:38,879 --> 00:17:39,559
I'm afraid

211
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,278
Senior Daoyan already planned

212
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:43,839
to die under Lu Jiaxue's blade
from the start.

213
00:17:46,718 --> 00:17:47,478
Even after his death,

214
00:17:47,478 --> 00:17:49,879
we couldn't even erect a tomb for him.

215
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:51,839
Senior Daoyan

216
00:17:53,518 --> 00:17:55,599
wishes to pave a path for us
using his death.

217
00:17:57,758 --> 00:17:59,559
We mustn't let his sacrifice be in vain.

218
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:03,559
But now,

219
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,599
Wang Yuan and Lu Jiaxue
have joined hands.

220
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:07,879
Few in the world

221
00:18:10,038 --> 00:18:12,478
can rival their influence and power.

222
00:18:13,438 --> 00:18:14,238
Shenyuan,

223
00:18:15,198 --> 00:18:16,718
what do you plan to do next?

224
00:18:17,856 --> 00:18:19,264
I'll take the imperial examination

225
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,992
and join the imperial court.

226
00:18:21,376 --> 00:18:23,008
I'll gain influence within the court

227
00:18:23,518 --> 00:18:24,758
at all costs.

228
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:25,879
You see,

229
00:18:26,032 --> 00:18:27,510
Lu Jiaxue held Seventh Lady hostage

230
00:18:27,518 --> 00:18:29,198
to make you show yourself.

231
00:18:29,344 --> 00:18:30,912
I think he's very confident
that you were

232
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,680
the one attempting
to rescue the convict.

233
00:18:32,944 --> 00:18:34,960
It seems unlikely
that this will end well.

234
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:36,319
Even if he wishes to make peace,

235
00:18:37,399 --> 00:18:38,839
I'll never let him off.

236
00:18:39,678 --> 00:18:40,478
Shenyuan.

237
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,238
Although we're not that capable,

238
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,272
we'll surely risk our lives for you

239
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,919
if you need our help.

240
00:18:48,718 --> 00:18:50,159
We can't let Master die in vain.

241
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:52,478
We can't let Senior Daoyan die in vain.

242
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:54,559
In this world,

243
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:57,438
fairness and justice

244
00:18:58,278 --> 00:18:59,518
will eventually arrive.

245
00:19:17,663 --> 00:19:20,584
(In memory of our honored
mentor Chen Jiuheng)

246
00:19:23,998 --> 00:19:24,758
Senior Daoyan.

247
00:20:09,198 --> 00:20:10,559
Senior Daoyan, please rest in peace.

248
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:15,198
If you see Master, please tell him

249
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:19,159
that I won't

250
00:20:21,198 --> 00:20:22,278
let him down.

251
00:21:35,278 --> 00:21:35,879
(Mei.)

252
00:21:37,438 --> 00:21:38,399
(Is that truly you?)

253
00:21:44,839 --> 00:21:46,919
Duke Ying, I'm afraid Marquis Lu

254
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:49,870
would've claimed credit for
eradicating the prison breakers

255
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:51,278
had you not arrived in time.

256
00:21:51,718 --> 00:21:53,079
He would've killed the witness

257
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:55,238
and pushed the blame
on the black-clad assailants.

258
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:57,038
That's very likely.

259
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,912
When I was there,

260
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:00,800
there should be two groups
of black-clad assailants

261
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:01,776
fighting each other.

262
00:22:02,079 --> 00:22:04,599
One group serves Li Jiaxue

263
00:22:05,038 --> 00:22:06,879
while the other group should be

264
00:22:06,919 --> 00:22:08,478
members of Chen Daoyan's faction.

265
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:11,879
Duke Ying, are you saying

266
00:22:12,198 --> 00:22:14,559
that Lu Jiaxue was speaking the truth
when he was at the hall?

267
00:22:15,399 --> 00:22:17,278
Was Chen Daoyan truly seeking death?

268
00:22:18,718 --> 00:22:19,678
I guess

269
00:22:20,150 --> 00:22:21,824
he sacrificed his life
for justice's sake.

270
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:24,678
However,

271
00:22:25,359 --> 00:22:26,998
Chen Daoyan did die

272
00:22:26,998 --> 00:22:28,399
under Lu Jiaxue's blade.

273
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:31,678
Lu Jiaxue is bound to be implicated.

274
00:22:31,678 --> 00:22:34,038
However, the Imperial Guards
failed their duties this time.

275
00:22:34,038 --> 00:22:35,998
Although Lu Jiaxue was criticized,

276
00:22:35,998 --> 00:22:38,678
there hasn't been
any substantial impact.

277
00:22:39,198 --> 00:22:39,919
Did His Majesty

278
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:41,478
still believe what they said?

279
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,238
If so,

280
00:22:46,678 --> 00:22:48,958
he wouldn't permit me
to submit the petition.

281
00:22:49,399 --> 00:22:49,879
So,

282
00:22:50,399 --> 00:22:51,478
you mean...

283
00:22:55,159 --> 00:22:56,839
A workman must first sharpen his tools

284
00:22:57,319 --> 00:22:58,839
if he is to do his work well.

285
00:22:59,616 --> 00:23:01,350
The person who lured me
into this situation

286
00:23:01,359 --> 00:23:02,958
is a clever strategist.

287
00:23:03,198 --> 00:23:04,839
He even showed me

288
00:23:04,839 --> 00:23:06,319
how Lu Jiaxue killed the witness.

289
00:23:07,879 --> 00:23:08,639
I think

290
00:23:09,359 --> 00:23:10,079
this case

291
00:23:10,718 --> 00:23:12,399
will be reopened soon.

292
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:18,119
You were always cautious.

293
00:23:18,879 --> 00:23:19,879
How did you fail

294
00:23:20,758 --> 00:23:22,639
this time around?

295
00:23:23,278 --> 00:23:24,438
I was negligent.

296
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:26,159
I never expected Duke Ying

297
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:28,278
to show up that quickly.

298
00:23:28,496 --> 00:23:30,736
His Majesty harbors deep thoughts
and intentions.

299
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,752
Since he allowed Duke Ying to intervene,

300
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:35,438
that means he's already
suspicious of us.

301
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:37,119
And now,

302
00:23:37,518 --> 00:23:39,839
the witness of the case
died by our hands.

303
00:23:40,438 --> 00:23:43,438
Although His Majesty isn't
pursuing any charges now,

304
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,478
I'm afraid
he's more suspicious of us now.

305
00:23:46,608 --> 00:23:49,104
I will keep a close eye on
Chen Jiuheng's remnant faction.

306
00:23:49,879 --> 00:23:51,278
I won't let them stir up trouble again.

307
00:23:51,678 --> 00:23:53,238
This remnant faction of his

308
00:23:53,718 --> 00:23:55,399
is so stubborn.

309
00:23:55,958 --> 00:23:57,359
It's been so many years,

310
00:23:57,472 --> 00:23:59,456
yet they're still thinking of
overturning the case.

311
00:23:59,879 --> 00:24:00,639
Marquis Lu,

312
00:24:01,119 --> 00:24:03,079
you have to eradicate
the root of the issue.

313
00:24:04,518 --> 00:24:05,839
Only then will you and I

314
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:07,919
be able to have peace of mind.

315
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:12,079
Understood.

316
00:24:13,438 --> 00:24:14,198
What is this?

317
00:24:14,198 --> 00:24:15,038
What notice is this?

318
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:16,599
(Chen Daoyan died in a robbery)

319
00:24:16,599 --> 00:24:18,520
Seems like the convict died.

320
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,920
I heard it seems to be a grievance.

321
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,616
Duke Ying is trying to gather evidence.

322
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,408
- Uncle.
- Your Lordship.

323
00:24:25,438 --> 00:24:27,319
Duke Ying is trying to tell everyone

324
00:24:27,936 --> 00:24:29,824
that he intends
to meddle with the case, huh?

325
00:24:31,678 --> 00:24:33,518
His Majesty is suspicious of us now.

326
00:24:34,438 --> 00:24:35,159
If not,

327
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,190
he wouldn't allow Duke Ying
to publish such a notice.

328
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,904
Will those people head to
Duke Ying's Residence, then?

329
00:24:40,399 --> 00:24:41,599
If anyone dares to do so,

330
00:24:42,518 --> 00:24:43,839
they'll end up like Chen Daoyan.

331
00:24:44,192 --> 00:24:45,904
You must keep a close eye on them.

332
00:24:47,198 --> 00:24:48,319
Yes, Your Lordship.

333
00:24:49,678 --> 00:24:51,399
How did last night's investigation go?

334
00:24:51,758 --> 00:24:53,518
They took the opportunity
to escape by water.

335
00:24:53,616 --> 00:24:54,990
They didn't leave any traces behind.

336
00:24:55,088 --> 00:24:57,152
I've investigated
the Luo's Residence as well.

337
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,630
Seventh Lady did leave the residence

338
00:24:58,639 --> 00:24:59,599
to enjoy the lanterns.

339
00:24:59,728 --> 00:25:01,936
However, Third Young Master Luo
didn't leave the residence.

340
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:05,801
Has Seventh Lady

341
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:07,392
returned to the Luo's Residence safely?

342
00:25:07,599 --> 00:25:08,958
Up until now,

343
00:25:09,088 --> 00:25:10,944
there haven't been any movements
from their side.

344
00:25:11,399 --> 00:25:12,678
I assume Seventh Lady is safe.

345
00:25:15,198 --> 00:25:16,879
Your Lordship, I was inept.

346
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:18,384
I failed to capture those criminals.

347
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:21,079
Let's drop the matter for now.

348
00:25:21,696 --> 00:25:22,688
Drop the matter?

349
00:25:23,792 --> 00:25:25,632
There's one thing
I need to confirm first.

350
00:25:27,392 --> 00:25:29,230
Uncle, are you still
wondering whether or not

351
00:25:29,376 --> 00:25:31,150
Seventh Lady
is the person you're looking for?

352
00:25:33,159 --> 00:25:33,958
It's a shame

353
00:25:34,758 --> 00:25:35,919
that you were the only one

354
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:37,839
who saw her face before.

355
00:25:38,718 --> 00:25:39,119
If not,

356
00:25:39,184 --> 00:25:41,184
we could've just told someone
to identify her.

357
00:26:13,958 --> 00:26:14,839
Third Young Master,

358
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,478
Young Lady says
she doesn't want to see you.

359
00:26:16,478 --> 00:26:17,438
Please head back.

360
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:20,736
Has she taken her medicine?
Does she feel better now?

361
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:23,718
Young Lady told us
to return this to you.

362
00:26:29,266 --> 00:26:29,905
All right.

363
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,119
I'll visit her another day.

364
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,225
(Haitang Abode)

365
00:26:43,278 --> 00:26:44,038
Young Master,

366
00:26:44,038 --> 00:26:46,599
I think Miss Qing Qu
was being too direct just now.

367
00:26:47,184 --> 00:26:49,110
I wasn't that direct
when I stopped Seventh Lady

368
00:26:49,119 --> 00:26:50,159
from seeing you.

369
00:26:57,119 --> 00:26:58,278
It's all my fault.

370
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:00,080
I shouldn't have told
Seventh Lady about this.

371
00:27:00,238 --> 00:27:01,678
That's how she got implicated.

372
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:03,399
Young Master, you should punish me.

373
00:27:04,399 --> 00:27:05,758
She's just angry at me.

374
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,168
It has nothing to do with you.

375
00:27:07,238 --> 00:27:09,238
But you hid the truth from her
for her own good.

376
00:27:09,678 --> 00:27:10,238
Young Master.

377
00:27:12,359 --> 00:27:12,998
(Lu Jiaxue!)

378
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:14,038
(Don't tell me)

379
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:16,109
(you don't want to know
the identity of the woman)

380
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:17,184
(who fell into the cliff?)

381
00:27:17,216 --> 00:27:18,150
I don't need to know.

382
00:27:18,639 --> 00:27:19,718
Let me tell you this.

383
00:27:20,238 --> 00:27:21,478
The woman who fell into the water

384
00:27:21,678 --> 00:27:23,799
was the woman
you longed for day and night!

385
00:27:26,958 --> 00:27:27,919
What did you say?

386
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:28,919
That woman,

387
00:27:29,478 --> 00:27:31,238
she's Mei.

388
00:27:32,478 --> 00:27:33,758
(Take Song Yingshan away.)

389
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:36,319
Let go of me!

390
00:27:40,438 --> 00:27:41,319
Lu Jiaxue!

391
00:27:41,559 --> 00:27:43,438
You ingrate!

392
00:27:43,438 --> 00:27:46,319
I'll never let you off
even after my death!

393
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:47,958
(You scum!)

394
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:52,478
Lu Jiaxue!

395
00:27:52,639 --> 00:27:53,998
No, I mean, Marquis Lu.

396
00:27:54,198 --> 00:27:55,079
I'm begging you.

397
00:27:55,559 --> 00:27:57,119
Please let my grandpa off!

398
00:27:57,119 --> 00:27:59,038
It's all my fault!
Everything was my fault!

399
00:27:59,968 --> 00:28:01,472
The deed has already been done.

400
00:28:01,639 --> 00:28:02,559
It's too late

401
00:28:03,438 --> 00:28:04,238
for you to regret it!

402
00:28:04,278 --> 00:28:06,678
Why don't you kill me
and spare the Song Family?

403
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,879
I'm begging you!

404
00:28:16,478 --> 00:28:17,119
Song Ziyun.

405
00:28:20,758 --> 00:28:22,749
You forced me to marry you
using your grandpa

406
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:24,896
as your backer.
When I wasn't willing to do so,

407
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:28,150
you joined hands with Lu Jiaran,
that "good" brother of mine,

408
00:28:29,198 --> 00:28:30,079
to harm me.

409
00:28:30,758 --> 00:28:31,599
You think

410
00:28:32,079 --> 00:28:33,879
I'll submit and join
the Song Family willingly

411
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:36,919
when you back me into a corner,

412
00:28:39,998 --> 00:28:40,758
am I right?

413
00:28:43,079 --> 00:28:44,038
That's not true!

414
00:28:44,678 --> 00:28:45,438
You're wrong.

415
00:28:47,359 --> 00:28:48,079
You see,

416
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:49,998
I never spare those

417
00:28:50,758 --> 00:28:51,839
who try to harm me.

418
00:28:53,678 --> 00:28:54,559
Moreover,

419
00:28:57,678 --> 00:28:58,718
it was you.

420
00:29:00,718 --> 00:29:02,639
My beloved Mei died because of you.

421
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:12,758
Don't worry.

422
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:15,119
I won't kill you.

423
00:29:18,599 --> 00:29:21,038
However, I'll make you wish for death.

424
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:28,198
Ye Yan.

425
00:29:28,359 --> 00:29:28,958
Yes, sir.

426
00:29:33,639 --> 00:29:35,599
Where is Song Ziyun right now?

427
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,880
She should be a slave
at the border area now.

428
00:29:41,038 --> 00:29:41,879
Find her.

429
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:42,599
Understood.

430
00:29:59,399 --> 00:30:01,599
Fugui, you're the best.

431
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:04,159
You're not like them.
They don't even visit me.

432
00:30:09,319 --> 00:30:09,919
What?

433
00:30:15,159 --> 00:30:17,518
All right. I'll untie it.

434
00:30:31,278 --> 00:30:31,958
(Yixiu.)

435
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:33,344
(What are you doing right now?)

436
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:35,278
I'm so bored.

437
00:30:35,438 --> 00:30:37,319
(This is the new incense I invented.)

438
00:30:37,438 --> 00:30:39,198
(I've invented several
new fragrances as well.)

439
00:30:39,319 --> 00:30:40,799
(But Fugui can't carry all of them.)

440
00:30:40,958 --> 00:30:42,198
(You can keep this for now.)

441
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:50,912
It's pretty good.

442
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,112
I guess I feel better now.

443
00:30:52,592 --> 00:30:54,368
(I heard from your mother
that she wanted you)

444
00:30:54,384 --> 00:30:55,910
(to marry into
Her Highness's Residence.)

445
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:57,712
(They belong to the imperial family.)

446
00:30:58,159 --> 00:30:59,359
(Han Zhao likes you too.)

447
00:30:59,408 --> 00:31:00,870
(If you do marry into their family,)

448
00:31:00,912 --> 00:31:02,384
(you won't need to lose any weight.)

449
00:31:02,416 --> 00:31:03,472
(I'm sure you'll be happy.)

450
00:31:03,478 --> 00:31:05,038
I don't want to
marry into her residence.

451
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:06,678
How could I be happy about that?

452
00:31:07,038 --> 00:31:08,599
It's been a few days since I've eaten.

453
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:14,198
Fugui, wait here.

454
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:37,359
All right now.

455
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:51,198
Sixth Lady, what are you doing?

456
00:31:53,038 --> 00:31:55,998
I saw several birds flying by just now.

457
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:15,678
I told you to stop it long ago.

458
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:18,109
The same birds pass by every time.

459
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:20,144
- Yiyu.
- But you don't get tired of the view.

460
00:32:20,919 --> 00:32:21,718
First Lady.

461
00:32:30,758 --> 00:32:32,438
I can't get used

462
00:32:32,438 --> 00:32:33,919
to the new pillow and blanket.

463
00:32:34,288 --> 00:32:35,920
Ms. Zhao, please head to the storeroom

464
00:32:35,968 --> 00:32:37,150
and get me another set.

465
00:32:41,438 --> 00:32:43,758
All right. I shall get to it now.

466
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:45,399
Thank you.

467
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,560
Stop staring.

468
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:03,438
Yiyu, you're the best.

469
00:33:05,958 --> 00:33:07,399
You're willful, aren't you?

470
00:33:07,399 --> 00:33:08,359
If they find out,

471
00:33:08,510 --> 00:33:10,720
you'll be punished,
and your pet goose will be cooked.

472
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,510
That's why I say you're the best.

473
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:13,839
You know how to cover my back.

474
00:33:16,438 --> 00:33:18,038
I don't understand at all.

475
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,750
Being able to marry into
the Han Family is a great blessing.

476
00:33:20,879 --> 00:33:22,919
Young Master Han fancies you as well.

477
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:24,469
Why aren't you willing to marry him?

478
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:26,368
And, you even argued
with Mother because of this.

479
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:28,278
But I don't like him.

480
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:29,438
Women like us can't choose

481
00:33:29,518 --> 00:33:31,159
where we marry into, you know?

482
00:33:31,238 --> 00:33:32,238
But...

483
00:33:32,272 --> 00:33:33,552
If you marry into one's family,

484
00:33:33,552 --> 00:33:35,870
you'll be the one spending
your entire life there.

485
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:37,559
Won't it be upsetting

486
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,320
if you don't like your husband?

487
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:41,839
By the way, I heard that Mother

488
00:33:41,839 --> 00:33:43,518
took you to
the Shen's Residence for a meal.

489
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:44,559
What do you think about

490
00:33:45,079 --> 00:33:46,119
Madam Shen?

491
00:33:46,359 --> 00:33:48,278
Weren't you trapped inside the room?

492
00:33:48,438 --> 00:33:49,799
How did you know about that?

493
00:33:50,518 --> 00:33:51,319
What about you?

494
00:33:51,319 --> 00:33:53,119
What do you think about Mr. Shen?

495
00:33:54,678 --> 00:33:56,478
The Shen Family is a family of counts.

496
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:57,998
They're no ordinary folks.

497
00:33:59,319 --> 00:34:00,678
To Shan,

498
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:03,119
- no matter if it brings benefits or...
- But...

499
00:34:03,733 --> 00:34:05,772
It doesn't matter
how dignified the family is.

500
00:34:06,147 --> 00:34:07,668
What if Shen Yu doesn't treat you well?

501
00:34:08,195 --> 00:34:09,235
What will you do by then?

502
00:34:10,641 --> 00:34:11,361
About that...

503
00:34:16,839 --> 00:34:18,319
What's your opinion on it, then?

504
00:34:20,799 --> 00:34:22,118
In my opinion,

505
00:34:22,638 --> 00:34:24,199
if I fancy someone,

506
00:34:24,319 --> 00:34:26,118
I won't care about his family
or background.

507
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,158
I'll fancy everything
that's related to him.

508
00:34:28,359 --> 00:34:30,738
Think about it. No matter
what I turn into or how dignified

509
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:31,739
my family is,

510
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:33,940
if he thinks I'm the best,
I'll be the best.

511
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,299
(I only took Han Zhao as my friend.)

512
00:34:54,299 --> 00:34:55,820
(I never wanted to get married to him.)

513
00:34:55,936 --> 00:34:57,730
(I don't care about
all those noble statuses.)

514
00:34:57,949 --> 00:34:58,949
(If I were to get married,)

515
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,720
(I'll only get married
to the person I fancy)

516
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:01,860
(and lead a happy life.)

517
00:35:16,801 --> 00:35:17,281
Hairu...

518
00:35:19,299 --> 00:35:20,060
What are you doing?

519
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,299
I'm drawing something.

520
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,020
You know how to draw?

521
00:35:24,256 --> 00:35:25,616
I'm drawing a landscape painting.

522
00:35:26,699 --> 00:35:27,940
Even Rui Xiang

523
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:30,020
won't fall for that.

524
00:35:30,659 --> 00:35:31,259
Enough already.

525
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,730
Since you've decided
to start your own business,

526
00:35:33,739 --> 00:35:35,380
you must prove yourself.

527
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:36,299
You have to learn

528
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:37,980
how to analyze all these ledgers.

529
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,099
Hairu?

530
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:44,380
I've already written
to our parents about it.

531
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:46,420
I shielded you from their scolding.

532
00:35:46,579 --> 00:35:48,380
However, they've already agreed to it.

533
00:35:49,259 --> 00:35:49,900
Hairu!

534
00:35:50,179 --> 00:35:50,779
Hairu!

535
00:35:51,299 --> 00:35:53,219
- You're the best!
- That's enough.

536
00:35:53,219 --> 00:35:54,980
I won't let you down!

537
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,560
This is a promise.

538
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,299
When I taught Yining
how to analyze ledgers,

539
00:35:58,299 --> 00:35:59,980
she picked it up immediately.

540
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:01,340
As a member of the Lin Family,

541
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,980
you can't afford to lose to your niece.

542
00:36:03,219 --> 00:36:04,340
Hairu, don't worry.

543
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:05,980
I'm talented.

544
00:36:08,779 --> 00:36:09,820
I will work hard!

545
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,400
(Account Book)

546
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,020
Madam,

547
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,340
you've been getting headaches again.

548
00:36:33,659 --> 00:36:35,340
You shouldn't worry that much.

549
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:38,579
Sixth Lady has been staying
in her room for the past few days.

550
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,259
You don't need to worry.

551
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:41,900
I'm glad to hear that.

552
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,299
If Yu

553
00:36:44,299 --> 00:36:45,820
can marry into

554
00:36:46,099 --> 00:36:47,500
the Count's Residence successfully,

555
00:36:48,259 --> 00:36:49,980
at least my efforts

556
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:51,579
won't be in vain.

557
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:54,420
If both ladies can marry into
excellent families,

558
00:36:54,544 --> 00:36:56,224
Madam, you'll have
two excellent sons-in-law

559
00:36:56,259 --> 00:36:58,139
to depend on in the future.

560
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,179
You won't need to fear

561
00:37:00,179 --> 00:37:01,940
any trouble in the future.

562
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:04,380
Hasn't Luo Yining

563
00:37:04,699 --> 00:37:06,500
been up to something lately?

564
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:08,739
Nothing at all.

565
00:37:09,259 --> 00:37:11,579
She's not as capable as I thought.

566
00:37:12,579 --> 00:37:13,540
She leads

567
00:37:14,020 --> 00:37:16,139
a rough life as well.

568
00:37:17,179 --> 00:37:19,619
I heard that she had fallen ill again.

569
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:20,699
Indeed.

570
00:37:21,179 --> 00:37:23,060
She never got to leave Haitang Abode.

571
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:25,460
Why does Seventh Lady

572
00:37:25,579 --> 00:37:28,299
have such a weak constitution?

573
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,980
She's just like a girl

574
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,340
from my in-law's family.

575
00:37:31,659 --> 00:37:33,340
She falls ill often too.

576
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,980
But she was a premature baby.

577
00:37:39,139 --> 00:37:40,460
Premature baby?

578
00:37:41,779 --> 00:37:43,179
Madam, what's wrong?

579
00:37:45,699 --> 00:37:48,259
When Gu Minglan died
after giving birth to her child,

580
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:51,340
all those old servants in the residence

581
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,360
went missing.

582
00:37:54,179 --> 00:37:56,060
I thought it was strange.

583
00:37:56,659 --> 00:37:58,020
However, as she was dead,

584
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:59,619
there was no way
to investigate the case.

585
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,860
Madam, what are you suspecting?

586
00:38:24,132 --> 00:38:25,612
You've been avoiding me for a few days.

587
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:27,820
If you're angry at me,

588
00:38:28,299 --> 00:38:29,500
you should vent it on me.

589
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:31,940
Don't hold it inside.
It'll make you uncomfortable.

590
00:38:33,259 --> 00:38:34,179
I'm not angry at you.

591
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,399
You're clearly angry
when you say it like that.

592
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:38,380
Qing Qu, you should leave first.

593
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:52,210
Let's sit down and talk.

594
00:38:52,656 --> 00:38:54,336
Third Brother,
I have nothing to say to you.

595
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,500
Sit down for now.

596
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,900
I never expected Shao'an

597
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:19,060
to hand the item to you that easily.

598
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,179
So, are you saying

599
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:22,259
that you plan to hide this from me

600
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,900
until I ask for the item?

601
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:28,295
That's right.

602
00:39:30,544 --> 00:39:32,420
Third Brother, you did
put in a lot of effort.

603
00:39:33,139 --> 00:39:34,179
You prepared a shop,

604
00:39:34,659 --> 00:39:35,779
found me a house,

605
00:39:36,259 --> 00:39:37,900
and even prepared my dowries for me.

606
00:39:38,699 --> 00:39:39,779
You're thoughtful indeed.

607
00:39:43,699 --> 00:39:44,779
This is what I think.

608
00:39:46,259 --> 00:39:47,619
No matter if I'm around or not,

609
00:39:48,699 --> 00:39:50,619
I wish to protect you forever.

610
00:39:51,248 --> 00:39:53,264
Third Brother,
thank you for being considerate.

611
00:39:53,531 --> 00:39:54,820
But to me,

612
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:56,219
I look like a fool!

613
00:39:56,984 --> 00:39:57,940
I did everything I could

614
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,619
so that you could join
our family register.

615
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,299
But I never expected you

616
00:40:01,299 --> 00:40:03,219
to be the leader
of Longquan Trading House.

617
00:40:03,221 --> 00:40:04,942
You possess half of
the capital's wealth.

618
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,639
Regarding that,

619
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:08,170
it wasn't like
I tried to hide it from you on purpose.

620
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,169
I just thought

621
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:11,808
that it was unnecessary
for me to tell you.

622
00:40:12,164 --> 00:40:12,724
That's right.

623
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:15,500
After that, you staged an act
with your shopkeeper

624
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:17,299
so that I could rent the place.

625
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:20,340
I'm sure you thought that I was a fool.

626
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:21,099
That's not true.

627
00:40:27,139 --> 00:40:28,739
I know you're worried about me.

628
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:31,340
You're worried
that I might be in danger.

629
00:40:32,699 --> 00:40:34,299
But for certain things,

630
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:37,540
it's impossible
to have the best of both worlds.

631
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,649
I can't just sit idly by

632
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:42,112
and watch them as they send my senior

633
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:44,179
to his demise.

634
00:40:44,224 --> 00:40:46,992
I can't just sit idly by and watch you
as you seek your own demise too!

635
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:51,179
Do you remember what you told me

636
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,699
when I toppled Mistress Qiao?

637
00:40:53,472 --> 00:40:55,690
You said I acted without
thinking of the consequences.

638
00:40:56,099 --> 00:40:57,540
You said I should protect myself.

639
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,779
You said that I stopped at nothing

640
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:01,940
and that I would definitely
hurt myself one day.

641
00:41:02,659 --> 00:41:03,460
What about you, then?

642
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:05,299
Did you manage to protect yourself?

643
00:41:05,659 --> 00:41:07,020
Did you consider the consequences?

644
00:41:19,299 --> 00:41:20,139
You even told me

645
00:41:20,659 --> 00:41:22,699
to lead a better life without you.

646
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:24,060
How can I do so?

647
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,272
Do you still expect me to enjoy
my loquat custard

648
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,020
and admire the ginkgo trees

649
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:29,340
happily, just like the past?

650
00:41:30,336 --> 00:41:31,952
Do I look like
a heartless person to you?

651
00:41:41,739 --> 00:41:42,540
I was wrong.

652
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,259
I didn't want to tell you about it

653
00:41:46,299 --> 00:41:48,060
as I didn't want you to get involved.

654
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:50,779
But firstly,

655
00:41:51,779 --> 00:41:52,460
I was wrong.

656
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:54,500
I'm afraid

657
00:41:55,099 --> 00:41:56,219
it's already too late.

658
00:41:57,340 --> 00:41:58,659
Since we're siblings,

659
00:42:00,048 --> 00:42:02,720
we'll inevitably be involved in
each other's affairs for a lifetime.

660
00:42:08,779 --> 00:42:09,460
Forget it.

661
00:42:11,092 --> 00:42:12,172
From now on, I hope

662
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,936
there'll be no secrets between us.
