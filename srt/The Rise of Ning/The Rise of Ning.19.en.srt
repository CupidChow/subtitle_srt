=The Rise of Ning=

00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,320
(Adapted from Wen Tan's novel "Chancellor
Training Handbook" from Jinjiang Literature)

3
00:01:36,697 --> 00:01:38,962
=Episode 19=

4
00:01:50,416 --> 00:01:51,536
Who exactly are you?

5
00:01:58,657 --> 00:02:00,377
I'm Seventh Lady of the Luo Family,

6
00:02:01,137 --> 00:02:02,056
Luo Yining.

7
00:02:02,896 --> 00:02:04,056
Only one person knows

8
00:02:04,536 --> 00:02:06,696
I'm good at gambling.

9
00:02:09,057 --> 00:02:09,856
Mei,

10
00:02:11,736 --> 00:02:12,536
is it you?

11
00:02:18,512 --> 00:02:20,050
Marquis Lu, is the Mei you mentioned

12
00:02:21,657 --> 00:02:22,736
Xu Mei?

13
00:02:23,696 --> 00:02:24,736
You're not Mei,

14
00:02:25,736 --> 00:02:26,736
but you know her.

15
00:02:27,497 --> 00:02:28,937
Tell me. Where is she?

16
00:02:29,296 --> 00:02:30,576
Marquis Lu, let go of me first.

17
00:02:37,536 --> 00:02:38,457
She's dead.

18
00:02:38,736 --> 00:02:39,536
What?

19
00:02:40,016 --> 00:02:41,337
I buried her myself.

20
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:42,976
You buried her? Why did you bury her?

21
00:02:43,217 --> 00:02:45,497
She was my maid,
and she grew up with me.

22
00:02:46,217 --> 00:02:47,377
We were like sisters.

23
00:02:48,337 --> 00:02:49,937
One day, she told me

24
00:02:49,937 --> 00:02:51,536
she had someone she liked

25
00:02:51,976 --> 00:02:54,536
and was willing to spend
the rest of her life with him

26
00:02:54,897 --> 00:02:55,937
and wait for him,

27
00:02:56,177 --> 00:02:57,497
no matter how long it took.

28
00:02:57,816 --> 00:02:59,536
She was willing to do anything for him.

29
00:03:01,617 --> 00:03:02,416
But

30
00:03:05,617 --> 00:03:06,416
she's dead.

31
00:03:08,976 --> 00:03:10,816
She was killed by that man.

32
00:03:12,217 --> 00:03:13,576
Impossible. This is nonsense.

33
00:03:14,296 --> 00:03:15,736
I sent my men to inspect the areas.

34
00:03:15,984 --> 00:03:17,170
There's no Luo Family's mansion

35
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:18,448
around the Lu Family's side yard.

36
00:03:18,544 --> 00:03:19,728
You're talking nonsense!

37
00:03:23,777 --> 00:03:25,256
She went with me to Baiyun Temple

38
00:03:25,856 --> 00:03:26,976
to find the kite,

39
00:03:27,256 --> 00:03:28,256
and she met you there.

40
00:03:28,777 --> 00:03:30,856
At that time, your eyes were injured.

41
00:03:31,497 --> 00:03:32,337
Since then,

42
00:03:33,057 --> 00:03:34,497
whenever I went to Baiyun Temple,

43
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:36,576
she would beg me

44
00:03:38,536 --> 00:03:40,097
to visit you on her behalf.

45
00:03:41,057 --> 00:03:43,377
Later, when you were rescued,

46
00:03:43,576 --> 00:03:45,897
you promised to come back and fetch her

47
00:03:46,057 --> 00:03:47,377
once your eyes were healed.

48
00:03:48,016 --> 00:03:49,696
Hence, I returned her indenture to her.

49
00:03:50,696 --> 00:03:52,696
But when I saw her again,

50
00:03:53,296 --> 00:03:54,897
she was covered in blood.

51
00:03:56,497 --> 00:03:58,337
She returned with her last breath.

52
00:04:00,136 --> 00:04:01,777
She fell off a cliff.

53
00:04:02,536 --> 00:04:04,497
I called every physician in the city,

54
00:04:05,337 --> 00:04:07,696
but none of them could save her.

55
00:04:09,696 --> 00:04:10,536
Do you know

56
00:04:11,617 --> 00:04:13,736
what her last words

57
00:04:14,617 --> 00:04:15,696
were?

58
00:04:20,337 --> 00:04:21,257
What did she say?

59
00:04:23,856 --> 00:04:25,736
She said she trusted the wrong person.

60
00:04:27,697 --> 00:04:29,296
She had a white jade pendant

61
00:04:29,296 --> 00:04:30,856
with the character "Lu" carved on it.

62
00:04:31,496 --> 00:04:32,897
I wondered

63
00:04:34,097 --> 00:04:35,697
who had deceived her.

64
00:04:36,616 --> 00:04:38,337
It turns out it's you, Marquis Lu.

65
00:04:41,257 --> 00:04:43,097
Mei died because of you.

66
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:46,137
Stop pretending you care for her.

67
00:04:47,657 --> 00:04:49,936
She can't see it anymore.

68
00:04:50,496 --> 00:04:51,296
No.

69
00:04:52,056 --> 00:04:53,137
This is impossible.

70
00:04:53,657 --> 00:04:55,097
You're lying, right?

71
00:04:55,257 --> 00:04:56,296
You're lying.

72
00:04:57,817 --> 00:04:59,376
Mei has to be alive.

73
00:05:00,257 --> 00:05:01,376
She has to be.

74
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:03,376
You said you buried her.

75
00:05:03,897 --> 00:05:05,137
Where did you bury her?

76
00:05:07,328 --> 00:05:09,890
The side yard's peach blossom forest,
west of the city outskirts.

77
00:05:11,056 --> 00:05:12,176
I didn't erupt a tombstone

78
00:05:12,897 --> 00:05:13,897
because I hoped

79
00:05:14,616 --> 00:05:16,657
she could forget her identity as Mei.

80
00:05:46,816 --> 00:05:48,290
Are you all right, Young Lady?

81
00:05:51,337 --> 00:05:52,137
Don't worry.

82
00:05:52,296 --> 00:05:53,217
My uncle won't allow

83
00:05:53,217 --> 00:05:54,736
anything to happen to her.

84
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,710
(Fengle House)

85
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,050
Are you all right, Young Lady?

86
00:06:08,817 --> 00:06:10,337
It's nothing. Let's leave now.

87
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:13,383
(Marquis Anbei's Residence)

88
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:15,930
(Wangyue Hall)

89
00:06:29,376 --> 00:06:31,736
The woman is dead, just let her be.

90
00:06:31,872 --> 00:06:33,370
However, these soldiers can't stay.

91
00:06:35,137 --> 00:06:35,897
Lu Jiaxue,

92
00:06:36,856 --> 00:06:38,496
don't you want to know

93
00:06:38,496 --> 00:06:40,376
who the woman who just fell off was?

94
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:42,897
I don't have to.

95
00:06:43,176 --> 00:06:44,296
I'll tell you.

96
00:06:44,976 --> 00:06:46,296
The one who just fell off was

97
00:06:46,577 --> 00:06:48,577
the woman you've been thinking about.

98
00:07:00,137 --> 00:07:01,056
What did you say?

99
00:07:03,897 --> 00:07:06,976
She's your Mei.

100
00:07:08,017 --> 00:07:10,137
Song Ziyun, are you insane?

101
00:07:13,897 --> 00:07:14,736
Mei!

102
00:07:15,457 --> 00:07:16,257
Your Lordship,

103
00:07:16,257 --> 00:07:18,137
it's too high.
I'm afraid there's little hope.

104
00:07:18,217 --> 00:07:19,017
Ye Yan,

105
00:07:19,176 --> 00:07:21,097
I want to find her, dead or alive.

106
00:07:21,296 --> 00:07:22,137
No.

107
00:07:22,616 --> 00:07:23,536
She won't die.

108
00:07:23,856 --> 00:07:25,736
Hurry. Save her now.

109
00:07:26,137 --> 00:07:26,936
Now!

110
00:07:27,017 --> 00:07:27,817
Understood.

111
00:08:59,736 --> 00:09:01,256
Mei!

112
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,200
(One)

113
00:09:07,008 --> 00:09:08,250
I'm not playing with you again.

114
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,616
You must be cheating.

115
00:09:09,693 --> 00:09:11,614
How could I cheat
when I can't see anything?

116
00:09:11,656 --> 00:09:13,736
How do you guess right every time?

117
00:09:14,736 --> 00:09:16,009
(I lost you at dice,)

118
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:17,248
(not mention to playing cards,)

119
00:09:19,297 --> 00:09:21,937
How about paper-cutting?

120
00:09:21,968 --> 00:09:24,208
I'll do the paper-cutting,
and you can guess what it is.

121
00:09:25,697 --> 00:09:26,537
Paper-cutting?

122
00:09:27,537 --> 00:09:29,736
How about we play the guqin?

123
00:09:29,896 --> 00:09:31,376
Lu Jiaxue, you're cunning.

124
00:09:31,976 --> 00:09:33,256
You're good at music,

125
00:09:34,136 --> 00:09:37,057
chess, dice,

126
00:09:37,457 --> 00:09:38,496
and calligraphy.

127
00:09:38,896 --> 00:09:40,457
What can't you do?

128
00:09:40,856 --> 00:09:41,976
I know everything.

129
00:09:42,736 --> 00:09:43,896
I don't believe you.

130
00:09:45,537 --> 00:09:46,817
I bet you can't make a clay doll.

131
00:09:46,817 --> 00:09:48,217
Clay dolls are my favorite.

132
00:09:48,217 --> 00:09:50,537
Like I said, I can learn.

133
00:09:50,697 --> 00:09:52,776
That's no easy thing.

134
00:09:52,896 --> 00:09:54,896
If I can watch how people make it,

135
00:09:55,217 --> 00:09:56,537
I'll figure it out.

136
00:10:03,057 --> 00:10:03,856
Ye Yan.

137
00:10:06,217 --> 00:10:07,016
Yes, Your Lordship.

138
00:10:08,457 --> 00:10:09,736
Go verify

139
00:10:09,937 --> 00:10:11,256
whether what Seventh Lady said

140
00:10:11,896 --> 00:10:13,177
is true.

141
00:10:13,937 --> 00:10:14,736
Yes, Your Lordship.

142
00:10:39,537 --> 00:10:40,376
Who's there?

143
00:10:45,057 --> 00:10:45,896
Answer me.

144
00:10:45,976 --> 00:10:47,376
Speak up, or I'll shout.

145
00:10:48,817 --> 00:10:50,656
It's me. Me!

146
00:10:52,297 --> 00:10:53,337
Who are you?

147
00:10:54,432 --> 00:10:54,930
It's me.

148
00:10:55,256 --> 00:10:56,097
Your third brother.

149
00:10:57,656 --> 00:10:58,656
Don't joke.

150
00:10:58,776 --> 00:11:00,656
I would know
if you were my Third Brother.

151
00:11:01,016 --> 00:11:01,937
Did you drink?

152
00:11:03,736 --> 00:11:04,537
You two,

153
00:11:04,616 --> 00:11:06,376
why are you hiding over there?

154
00:11:06,776 --> 00:11:08,097
The side gate is locked.

155
00:11:08,297 --> 00:11:09,656
Why are you here alone?

156
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:11,896
Mind your own business.

157
00:11:15,097 --> 00:11:15,976
You head back first.

158
00:11:16,297 --> 00:11:18,136
- I'll go check on her.
- All right.

159
00:11:18,616 --> 00:11:19,656
Stay there.

160
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:31,337
Are you all right?

161
00:11:32,537 --> 00:11:33,297
I'm good.

162
00:11:36,856 --> 00:11:38,057
I can still drink more.

163
00:11:38,577 --> 00:11:39,656
Fine. You can.

164
00:11:44,896 --> 00:11:45,736
What are you doing?

165
00:11:46,817 --> 00:11:48,136
I'm going to the sky.

166
00:11:48,448 --> 00:11:50,288
- I'm going to climb the tree.
- Don't.

167
00:11:50,464 --> 00:11:52,272
- Get down.
- I want to climb up to the sky.

168
00:11:53,057 --> 00:11:54,097
It's late at night.

169
00:11:54,656 --> 00:11:55,457
Sit properly.

170
00:11:55,656 --> 00:11:56,577
You sit properly, too.

171
00:12:14,057 --> 00:12:14,577
Did...

172
00:12:14,736 --> 00:12:15,537
Did someone

173
00:12:17,097 --> 00:12:18,537
bully you?

174
00:12:18,856 --> 00:12:20,297
Who dares to bully me?

175
00:12:21,656 --> 00:12:22,496
Third Brother,

176
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:24,097
I've been thinking

177
00:12:24,856 --> 00:12:27,136
about those carefree days

178
00:12:28,297 --> 00:12:30,457
in the side yard

179
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:32,496
these days.

180
00:12:46,697 --> 00:12:48,537
If someone bullied me,

181
00:12:48,937 --> 00:12:50,656
would you take revenge for me?

182
00:12:52,217 --> 00:12:53,376
Someone did bully you?

183
00:12:55,496 --> 00:12:56,976
No one dares to.

184
00:12:57,496 --> 00:12:58,937
I'm amazing.

185
00:13:09,856 --> 00:13:11,097
Let me take you back, all right?

186
00:13:18,217 --> 00:13:19,537
I swallowed it.

187
00:13:25,297 --> 00:13:26,577
I swallowed it down.

188
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:46,417
Third Brother,

189
00:13:48,016 --> 00:13:48,856
I want...

190
00:13:50,616 --> 00:13:52,976
I want you to stay with me forever.

191
00:13:54,097 --> 00:13:55,937
Of course, I'll stay with you forever.

192
00:13:57,656 --> 00:14:00,376
I'll also be with you
in our next lives.

193
00:14:03,376 --> 00:14:04,537
In our next lives,

194
00:14:05,496 --> 00:14:06,297
we must be

195
00:14:10,217 --> 00:14:11,976
siblings again.

196
00:14:24,976 --> 00:14:26,537
I don't want just to be siblings.

197
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:32,359
♪Musing on mellow memories,
a blush colors my face♪

198
00:14:33,711 --> 00:14:38,577
♪I question my fate
and face it honestly♪

199
00:14:38,937 --> 00:14:42,827
♪My heart leans on yours,
embraced by a rosy ambiance♪

200
00:14:55,537 --> 00:14:56,537
Young Lady, you're awake.

201
00:15:00,616 --> 00:15:01,776
How did I get back

202
00:15:02,057 --> 00:15:03,337
last night?

203
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,440
Third Young Master brought you back.

204
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:06,976
Only Xue Zhi and I know about it.

205
00:15:07,177 --> 00:15:08,656
Why didn't you call for us

206
00:15:08,656 --> 00:15:10,496
when you went out last night?

207
00:15:12,856 --> 00:15:13,736
What is this?

208
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,041
Shao'an sent this hangover soup over.

209
00:15:16,112 --> 00:15:17,540
He said the Third Young Master thought

210
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:18,848
you might need it this morning.

211
00:15:20,976 --> 00:15:22,177
It's my fault.

212
00:15:22,256 --> 00:15:24,297
I shouldn't have
let you drink last night.

213
00:15:24,376 --> 00:15:26,577
You finished all the rice liquor.

214
00:15:26,616 --> 00:15:28,256
I won't drink anymore.

215
00:15:29,104 --> 00:15:30,090
By the way, Young Lady,

216
00:15:30,256 --> 00:15:31,376
I found an old woman

217
00:15:31,376 --> 00:15:32,976
who retired from the Chen's Residence.

218
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,417
I learned from her

219
00:15:34,417 --> 00:15:36,776
that the chef back then
was called Qian Danian.

220
00:15:36,832 --> 00:15:38,010
He was from Yangzhong, Zhenjiang.

221
00:15:38,016 --> 00:15:39,097
His cooking skills were good,

222
00:15:39,097 --> 00:15:40,817
so Old Master Chen kept him.

223
00:15:40,817 --> 00:15:41,896
But before long,

224
00:15:41,896 --> 00:15:44,057
the chef fell ill and died.

225
00:15:44,616 --> 00:15:45,417
He died?

226
00:15:45,417 --> 00:15:46,177
Yes.

227
00:15:47,136 --> 00:15:49,649
Doesn't that mean
we can't find any evidence?

228
00:15:57,817 --> 00:15:59,496
Young Master, please drink some tea.

229
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,199
Did nothing happen

230
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:05,728
to Seventh Lady yesterday?

231
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:07,262
Qing Qu and Xue Zhi said

232
00:16:07,287 --> 00:16:08,767
she was fine.

233
00:16:09,976 --> 00:16:10,776
However,

234
00:16:10,937 --> 00:16:13,417
Shopkeeper Zheng spotted Qing Qu

235
00:16:13,417 --> 00:16:15,369
drinking with an old woman
at the tavern,

236
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:16,256
and she gave her money.

237
00:16:16,272 --> 00:16:18,208
It seems she was asking something
from the old woman.

238
00:16:20,297 --> 00:16:21,736
Who is that old woman?

239
00:16:21,776 --> 00:16:22,937
I investigated her.

240
00:16:22,937 --> 00:16:24,577
She was once a maid

241
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,140
who served Madam Chen's maternal family.

242
00:16:26,177 --> 00:16:28,337
She was kicked out due to some misdeeds.

243
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,841
The Chen Family?

244
00:16:35,057 --> 00:16:35,856
Fugui.

245
00:16:37,097 --> 00:16:37,937
Fugui.

246
00:16:43,817 --> 00:16:44,616
Yixiu.

247
00:16:45,937 --> 00:16:47,057
I forgot something.

248
00:16:47,736 --> 00:16:48,496
Yixiu.

249
00:16:48,496 --> 00:16:49,736
Oh, I think I took it.

250
00:16:49,937 --> 00:16:50,736
Yixiu.

251
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:52,736
I'm calling you. Didn't you hear me?

252
00:16:53,616 --> 00:16:55,097
Isn't this Sixth Uncle?

253
00:16:55,896 --> 00:16:58,736
Where did he come from?

254
00:16:59,297 --> 00:17:00,776
Did he fly

255
00:17:00,856 --> 00:17:02,057
out of the water?

256
00:17:03,776 --> 00:17:06,097
My sister went out to buy supplies
for the exam,

257
00:17:06,097 --> 00:17:07,337
but she won't be back soon.

258
00:17:07,696 --> 00:17:09,097
So I sneak out.

259
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:10,537
Well,

260
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:12,537
how's my Fugui?

261
00:17:13,456 --> 00:17:15,936
I knew it. He wouldn't come
looking for me.

262
00:17:16,097 --> 00:17:17,656
He's here because of Fugui.

263
00:17:18,057 --> 00:17:20,936
Well, Fugui... It was sent away.

264
00:17:20,936 --> 00:17:22,896
Sent away? Where?

265
00:17:27,456 --> 00:17:29,577
Fugui...

266
00:17:36,737 --> 00:17:38,176
It was sent to Seventh Lady's abode.

267
00:17:40,616 --> 00:17:41,696
I see.

268
00:17:44,817 --> 00:17:46,936
How are you acting strange today?

269
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:48,770
You sound like
you're hinting at something.

270
00:17:49,416 --> 00:17:50,896
Am I acting strange today?

271
00:17:51,817 --> 00:17:52,616
True.

272
00:17:52,936 --> 00:17:54,216
Sixth Uncle

273
00:17:54,216 --> 00:17:55,370
has always liked pretty faces,

274
00:17:55,376 --> 00:17:56,850
beautiful views, and delicious food.

275
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:58,656
I'm fat and ugly.

276
00:17:58,656 --> 00:18:00,257
I mustn't let him see my face.

277
00:18:00,257 --> 00:18:01,497
Go. I don't want him to see me.

278
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:02,216
Yixiu.

279
00:18:03,297 --> 00:18:06,176
How... How did you know that?

280
00:18:06,777 --> 00:18:08,696
I didn't mean what I said to my sister.

281
00:18:08,817 --> 00:18:10,737
You didn't mean that?
What do you mean then?

282
00:18:10,737 --> 00:18:11,817
I don't care what you mean.

283
00:18:11,817 --> 00:18:12,817
Lin Mao,

284
00:18:12,817 --> 00:18:14,097
you're despicable and shameless!

285
00:18:14,097 --> 00:18:15,977
You are a hypocrite and scoundrel!

286
00:18:15,977 --> 00:18:18,257
I'm telling you,
I'm going out to have fun.

287
00:18:18,257 --> 00:18:20,097
Listen. You want to explain to me?

288
00:18:20,097 --> 00:18:21,297
But I don't have time for you.

289
00:18:21,297 --> 00:18:23,537
I won't listen to you!

290
00:18:23,537 --> 00:18:24,788
Stop explaining.

291
00:18:27,656 --> 00:18:29,176
- Let's go.
- I...

292
00:18:47,497 --> 00:18:48,297
Ms. Yang.

293
00:18:54,376 --> 00:18:55,577
Greetings, Mr. Luo.

294
00:18:55,648 --> 00:18:56,930
There's no need for the formalities.

295
00:18:58,257 --> 00:18:59,537
I have had my men

296
00:18:59,696 --> 00:19:01,337
search for your brother.

297
00:19:01,696 --> 00:19:02,616
Don't worry.

298
00:19:02,616 --> 00:19:03,777
I'll do everything in my power

299
00:19:03,777 --> 00:19:05,136
to search for your family.

300
00:19:05,257 --> 00:19:06,577
Mr. Luo, you've done a great favor

301
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:07,856
for my family.

302
00:19:07,888 --> 00:19:09,830
There's nothing I can do
to repay your kindness.

303
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,930
If I'm fortunate enough
to reunite with my brother,

304
00:19:12,497 --> 00:19:13,537
I'll surely offer you

305
00:19:13,537 --> 00:19:15,577
a longevity tablet in my home

306
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:16,977
and wish you well forever.

307
00:19:17,297 --> 00:19:18,376
That's more than necessary.

308
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:20,017
It's just a small favor.

309
00:19:20,777 --> 00:19:22,977
Also, you don't have to
do the needlework

310
00:19:23,017 --> 00:19:24,537
to repay me.

311
00:19:33,696 --> 00:19:36,456
Why are you looking at me
like that?

312
00:19:37,017 --> 00:19:39,696
Is there anything wrong with me?

313
00:19:40,696 --> 00:19:43,097
No, please pardon me.

314
00:19:46,257 --> 00:19:47,376
I just feel

315
00:19:49,456 --> 00:19:50,936
that you look exactly like

316
00:19:52,337 --> 00:19:54,136
an acquaintance of mine.

317
00:19:54,257 --> 00:19:56,936
Is she the woman
Old Madam Luo mentioned?

318
00:20:06,856 --> 00:20:09,337
I knew this woman was up to something

319
00:20:09,337 --> 00:20:10,777
when she came here.

320
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,497
What's wrong with Old Madam?

321
00:20:13,497 --> 00:20:14,817
Why didn't she insist on keeping

322
00:20:14,817 --> 00:20:16,537
someone who looks like Madam Gu?

323
00:20:16,602 --> 00:20:17,963
Rumors are making the rounds

324
00:20:18,097 --> 00:20:19,777
in the residence.

325
00:20:19,856 --> 00:20:21,176
- They say...
- Don't be rude.

326
00:20:21,936 --> 00:20:23,136
She's our guest.

327
00:20:24,497 --> 00:20:25,856
Don't gossip about her.

328
00:20:27,097 --> 00:20:29,297
Let's leave. Later, I'll take Yixiu

329
00:20:29,297 --> 00:20:30,856
to visit the Princess Royal.

330
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:31,777
Yes.

331
00:20:31,777 --> 00:20:34,176
Go check on Sixth Lady
and see if she's ready.

332
00:20:40,696 --> 00:20:41,817
No need to be so courteous.

333
00:20:41,817 --> 00:20:42,936
Don't worry and stay here.

334
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:47,537
Thank you, Mr. Luo.

335
00:21:05,859 --> 00:21:08,818
She's the exact duplicate...

336
00:21:11,216 --> 00:21:13,456
Chengzhang, who do you think
she looks like?

337
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,200
Minglan.

338
00:21:21,257 --> 00:21:23,057
She passed away many years ago.

339
00:21:23,376 --> 00:21:24,257
I didn't know

340
00:21:24,376 --> 00:21:26,097
you still remembered

341
00:21:26,297 --> 00:21:27,537
her face clearly.

342
00:21:30,696 --> 00:21:32,097
I have something to attend to.

343
00:21:32,097 --> 00:21:33,097
I will take my leave.

344
00:21:47,977 --> 00:21:50,097
Grandma, you said

345
00:21:50,376 --> 00:21:52,737
Father, Uncle,

346
00:21:52,856 --> 00:21:54,017
and Mother

347
00:21:54,297 --> 00:21:55,777
grew up together.

348
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:59,920
The Luo and Gu Families
have known each other for a long time.

349
00:22:00,017 --> 00:22:02,337
We've been in close contact
since Old Master

350
00:22:02,338 --> 00:22:03,699
and Old Master Gu were still alive.

351
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:04,976
I've watched Minglan grow up

352
00:22:04,992 --> 00:22:07,200
since she was a kid.

353
00:22:07,577 --> 00:22:09,176
She was like a daughter to me.

354
00:22:09,376 --> 00:22:11,856
I wanted her to be my daughter-in-law

355
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,979
once she grew up.

356
00:22:16,456 --> 00:22:19,176
But why didn't you arrange for my mother

357
00:22:19,177 --> 00:22:20,697
to marry Uncle?

358
00:22:24,577 --> 00:22:25,936
Why are you asking

359
00:22:26,416 --> 00:22:28,656
about these things today?

360
00:22:29,777 --> 00:22:31,337
I'm just curious about it.

361
00:22:32,216 --> 00:22:34,097
Ms. Yang and my mother

362
00:22:34,097 --> 00:22:35,656
look alike.

363
00:22:35,945 --> 00:22:37,065
Every time I see her,

364
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:38,936
it reminds me of Mother.

365
00:22:39,297 --> 00:22:41,176
So I want to know more

366
00:22:41,497 --> 00:22:43,136
about her story before she passed away.

367
00:22:44,537 --> 00:22:46,696
Your uncle's marriage was decided

368
00:22:47,176 --> 00:22:49,569
by your great-great-grandpa
when he was still alive,

369
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:51,536
along with Mr. Chen,
who was the grand secretariat

370
00:22:51,552 --> 00:22:52,970
of Hanli Academy.

371
00:22:53,616 --> 00:22:56,136
Both the Luo and Gu Families

372
00:22:56,136 --> 00:22:58,216
were always in contact,

373
00:22:58,216 --> 00:23:01,737
so your mother was betrothed
to your father.

374
00:23:03,696 --> 00:23:04,497
Say,

375
00:23:05,137 --> 00:23:07,377
that lady resembles your mother,

376
00:23:07,856 --> 00:23:09,856
but they are different people,
after all.

377
00:23:10,303 --> 00:23:12,103
Don't overthink.

378
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,360
Young Lady,

379
00:23:20,696 --> 00:23:21,456
did you

380
00:23:21,456 --> 00:23:23,936
bring up the past to Old Madam
on purpose?

381
00:23:24,977 --> 00:23:27,257
I really don't understand

382
00:23:27,376 --> 00:23:29,936
why Aunt would endanger Mother?

383
00:23:31,337 --> 00:23:32,537
Until last time,

384
00:23:32,537 --> 00:23:34,696
Xue Zhi mentioned something.

385
00:23:35,057 --> 00:23:35,896
She said

386
00:23:36,097 --> 00:23:38,497
that Uncle saved Ms. Yang

387
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,001
because he sympathized

388
00:23:40,097 --> 00:23:41,537
with her difficulty.

389
00:23:43,257 --> 00:23:44,456
Do you suspect

390
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:46,497
that Madam Chen hurt Madam Gu

391
00:23:46,656 --> 00:23:47,737
because of First Master?

392
00:23:50,321 --> 00:23:52,336
(Luo's Residence)

393
00:23:58,616 --> 00:23:59,416
Young Lady,

394
00:23:59,456 --> 00:24:01,176
Madam Lin sent

395
00:24:01,176 --> 00:24:02,337
some brushes and ink over.

396
00:24:02,337 --> 00:24:03,817
It's for Young Master Xuan.

397
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:05,337
They are a complete set of supplies.

398
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:06,505
Put them away.

399
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,120
Yes.

400
00:24:08,537 --> 00:24:09,337
By the way,

401
00:24:10,552 --> 00:24:12,312
has Xuan eaten dinner yet?

402
00:24:13,266 --> 00:24:14,545
No, Young Lady.

403
00:24:17,696 --> 00:24:19,737
Look at this. The brush is broken again.

404
00:24:20,616 --> 00:24:21,376
Young Master.

405
00:24:22,696 --> 00:24:23,376
What is that?

406
00:24:23,376 --> 00:24:25,497
Madam Lin sent some writing supplies

407
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:26,696
for the exam over.

408
00:24:27,097 --> 00:24:27,896
Let me have a look.

409
00:24:32,784 --> 00:24:34,112
This brush is pretty good.

410
00:24:34,176 --> 00:24:34,977
Don't touch it.

411
00:24:35,936 --> 00:24:36,737
What's wrong?

412
00:24:38,456 --> 00:24:40,656
This is given by Madam Lin.

413
00:24:40,656 --> 00:24:43,097
Now's a crucial moment for us.

414
00:24:43,136 --> 00:24:44,696
We must be careful.

415
00:24:44,896 --> 00:24:46,297
We can't use the things from others

416
00:24:46,376 --> 00:24:47,616
even though they are good.

417
00:24:47,737 --> 00:24:48,817
I'll prepare everything

418
00:24:48,936 --> 00:24:50,577
you need.

419
00:24:50,696 --> 00:24:52,777
Ying, bring my brush over.

420
00:24:52,777 --> 00:24:54,537
- Give it to Xuan.
- Yes.

421
00:25:02,143 --> 00:25:02,982
Xuan,

422
00:25:03,176 --> 00:25:05,176
why not have dinner

423
00:25:05,497 --> 00:25:06,456
before you study?

424
00:25:06,832 --> 00:25:07,872
Eat?

425
00:25:07,936 --> 00:25:09,376
I don't even have time to study now,

426
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:10,456
and you want me to eat?

427
00:25:10,537 --> 00:25:11,737
Don't waste my time.

428
00:25:16,456 --> 00:25:17,257
Young Lady,

429
00:25:17,456 --> 00:25:19,337
Young Master Xuan is skipping his meals

430
00:25:19,337 --> 00:25:21,017
while studying day and night.

431
00:25:21,337 --> 00:25:22,497
If this goes on,

432
00:25:22,537 --> 00:25:24,456
he won't be able to keep it up.

433
00:25:31,856 --> 00:25:33,696
He has been acting weird

434
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:35,456
since the Literary Feast.

435
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,560
A few days ago,

436
00:25:36,577 --> 00:25:38,097
Father called him to review his studies.

437
00:25:38,616 --> 00:25:40,936
That fellow from Jimo House went, too.

438
00:25:41,057 --> 00:25:42,017
He didn't eat dinner

439
00:25:42,176 --> 00:25:43,696
afterward

440
00:25:43,825 --> 00:25:46,266
and even tore all his articles.

441
00:25:46,416 --> 00:25:47,737
I asked him what happened,

442
00:25:47,896 --> 00:25:49,297
but he told me not to meddle.

443
00:25:49,416 --> 00:25:50,497
Could it be

444
00:25:50,696 --> 00:25:53,216
that Second Master praised
that fellow from Jimo House

445
00:25:53,216 --> 00:25:54,936
for doing better than Young Master Xuan?

446
00:25:56,416 --> 00:25:58,057
This fellow

447
00:25:58,057 --> 00:25:59,416
is scheming.

448
00:25:59,537 --> 00:26:02,216
He and Luo Yining are the same.

449
00:26:02,537 --> 00:26:04,136
The exam is approaching.

450
00:26:04,257 --> 00:26:05,737
What if Young Master Xuan...

451
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:07,510
Xuan has been hardworking
since he was a kid.

452
00:26:07,737 --> 00:26:09,737
Besides, he's aware of

453
00:26:09,737 --> 00:26:11,216
what the exam means to him.

454
00:26:11,216 --> 00:26:12,557
He won't mess it up.

455
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,640
What I'm saying is

456
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,160
that he'll surely do well in the exam.

457
00:26:15,337 --> 00:26:17,297
But what if

458
00:26:17,297 --> 00:26:18,977
that fellow from Jimo House does better

459
00:26:19,257 --> 00:26:21,537
and gets praised

460
00:26:21,936 --> 00:26:23,057
by Second Master?

461
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:25,537
When will Mistress Qiao
be able to come back?

462
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:30,057
- Bring that to me.
- Yes.

463
00:26:46,376 --> 00:26:47,337
Lin Hairu

464
00:26:47,337 --> 00:26:48,737
prepared the same thing

465
00:26:48,737 --> 00:26:50,616
for all the young masters
of the second home?

466
00:26:50,936 --> 00:26:51,936
Yes, Young Lady.

467
00:27:04,977 --> 00:27:05,777
Young Lady,

468
00:27:05,936 --> 00:27:07,737
it'll be troublesome

469
00:27:07,737 --> 00:27:09,176
if someone finds out.

470
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,920
We can't hesitate now.

471
00:27:11,376 --> 00:27:12,696
Go find someone reliable

472
00:27:12,696 --> 00:27:13,817
to get this done properly.

473
00:27:14,017 --> 00:27:15,656
Don't worry about the money.

474
00:27:15,737 --> 00:27:17,456
Hurry and bring it back to me.

475
00:27:18,856 --> 00:27:19,817
Go now.

476
00:27:20,456 --> 00:27:21,257
Yes, Young Lady.

477
00:27:31,537 --> 00:27:32,337
Mother,

478
00:27:32,737 --> 00:27:35,057
you didn't supervise
Shan's studies today.

479
00:27:35,136 --> 00:27:36,577
Where are you taking me?

480
00:27:36,656 --> 00:27:38,977
Today, we're going to meet
the Princess Royal.

481
00:27:40,297 --> 00:27:41,856
To meet the Princess Royal?

482
00:27:42,176 --> 00:27:43,696
Why the sudden visit?

483
00:27:44,456 --> 00:27:46,497
I received the invitation
all of a sudden.

484
00:27:46,817 --> 00:27:48,136
I was asked to bring you

485
00:27:48,176 --> 00:27:49,616
to visit the Princess Royal.

486
00:27:50,777 --> 00:27:53,176
- Just me alone?
- Right.

487
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,245
(Zaiyun Hall)

488
00:28:18,281 --> 00:28:19,041
I didn't know

489
00:28:19,057 --> 00:28:20,896
you were Her Highness's son.

490
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,530
Well, I didn't have a chance

491
00:28:22,537 --> 00:28:23,616
to introduce myself properly.

492
00:28:23,896 --> 00:28:25,817
I'm Han Zhao,
the son of the Princess Royal.

493
00:28:27,936 --> 00:28:29,136
Greetings, Madam Chen.

494
00:28:29,656 --> 00:28:30,656
Greetings, Sixth Lady.

495
00:28:31,696 --> 00:28:32,537
Please come this way.

496
00:28:37,497 --> 00:28:39,136
Mother, our guests have arrived.

497
00:28:40,856 --> 00:28:42,337
Greetings, Your Highness.

498
00:28:44,297 --> 00:28:46,936
Madam Chen, Sixth Lady.

499
00:28:48,257 --> 00:28:50,017
My son has always had a poor appetite.

500
00:28:50,024 --> 00:28:52,304
I heard that his appetite had improved

501
00:28:52,337 --> 00:28:53,737
with Sixth Lady's help.

502
00:28:53,777 --> 00:28:55,057
I'm truly grateful.

503
00:28:55,537 --> 00:28:57,337
Today, I specially invited you here

504
00:28:57,337 --> 00:28:59,537
to express my gratitude.

505
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,610
That's very kind of you, Your Highness.

506
00:29:02,097 --> 00:29:05,017
It's my daughter's good fortune

507
00:29:05,176 --> 00:29:06,817
to get to know Mr. Han.

508
00:29:07,833 --> 00:29:09,113
You flatter me, Madam Chen.

509
00:29:10,017 --> 00:29:11,337
It's my good fortune

510
00:29:11,777 --> 00:29:13,257
to meet Yixiu.

511
00:29:14,696 --> 00:29:16,577
I've had the kitchen
prepare some fine dishes.

512
00:29:16,736 --> 00:29:17,490
This way, please.

513
00:29:47,936 --> 00:29:49,896
Please enjoy.

514
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,930
That's an ornamental dish.

515
00:30:24,832 --> 00:30:26,976
We can only look at it and not eat it?
That's a waste.

516
00:30:33,416 --> 00:30:34,216
Mother,

517
00:30:34,616 --> 00:30:36,817
I also think the ornamental dish
is a bit wasteful.

518
00:30:36,856 --> 00:30:38,297
His Majesty always taught us

519
00:30:38,304 --> 00:30:40,720
to be hardworking and frugal
for the sake of our nation and homes.

520
00:30:41,497 --> 00:30:42,696
The rule

521
00:30:42,696 --> 00:30:43,497
needs to change.

522
00:30:56,136 --> 00:30:56,936
Sweet and fragrant.

523
00:31:01,337 --> 00:31:02,737
You're right, Zhao.

524
00:31:02,737 --> 00:31:04,416
Sixth Lady, please help yourself.

525
00:31:05,017 --> 00:31:05,497
Sure.

526
00:31:22,977 --> 00:31:24,136
This meat

527
00:31:24,136 --> 00:31:26,017
is savory and refreshing.

528
00:31:26,057 --> 00:31:27,577
It's also slightly spicy.

529
00:31:27,616 --> 00:31:29,977
Is it made with frankincense
and pepper?

530
00:31:30,376 --> 00:31:32,616
You can tell the ingredients
just by smelling the food?

531
00:31:33,097 --> 00:31:35,216
I enjoy studying food in my free time.

532
00:31:35,264 --> 00:31:37,520
Right, the refreshing taste comes from
the frankincense.

533
00:31:37,537 --> 00:31:39,856
As for the pepper,
I bought it from the palace

534
00:31:39,856 --> 00:31:40,977
and gave it to the kitchen.

535
00:31:40,977 --> 00:31:42,537
Your Highness, do you like cooking, too?

536
00:31:42,577 --> 00:31:44,577
Well, I always think about

537
00:31:44,577 --> 00:31:45,936
how to make delicious food

538
00:31:45,936 --> 00:31:48,337
so my son will eat more.

539
00:31:48,936 --> 00:31:50,416
You have to eat well from now on.

540
00:31:50,416 --> 00:31:52,097
Don't disappoint Her Highness.

541
00:31:52,337 --> 00:31:53,737
Sure. I will try.

542
00:31:54,097 --> 00:31:55,216
Eat some more.

543
00:31:55,216 --> 00:31:56,656
Pepper promotes blood circulation.

544
00:31:56,656 --> 00:31:57,896
It's good for your health.

545
00:31:57,936 --> 00:31:58,737
All right.

546
00:32:07,696 --> 00:32:08,577
I really wish Zhao

547
00:32:08,577 --> 00:32:11,097
could always have a good appetite.

548
00:32:11,176 --> 00:32:12,577
He couldn't eat a few days ago.

549
00:32:12,577 --> 00:32:13,936
I was so worried about him.

550
00:32:14,112 --> 00:32:15,490
Fortunately, with Sixth Lady's help,

551
00:32:15,497 --> 00:32:17,817
he has finally started eating again.

552
00:32:18,017 --> 00:32:19,329
Your Highness, if you don't mind,

553
00:32:19,330 --> 00:32:20,656
Yixiu can continue helping Mr. Han

554
00:32:20,656 --> 00:32:22,620
with his eating issues.

555
00:32:22,737 --> 00:32:25,457
Hence, you won't have to worry too much.

556
00:32:25,497 --> 00:32:26,649
Mother, I'm not a physician.

557
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:28,128
How can I help with his health issue?

558
00:32:31,057 --> 00:32:32,737
Sixth Lady is simple and frank.

559
00:32:32,737 --> 00:32:33,856
She's cute.

560
00:32:34,977 --> 00:32:37,176
I agree with you, Mother.

561
00:32:51,566 --> 00:32:54,636
(Caifu Abode)

562
00:33:06,297 --> 00:33:08,176
Lin Mao, you insincere,

563
00:33:08,176 --> 00:33:09,936
despicable, and shameless. Scoundrel!

564
00:33:10,856 --> 00:33:11,977
I heard the Princess Royal

565
00:33:11,977 --> 00:33:13,097
only invited Madam Chen

566
00:33:13,097 --> 00:33:14,416
and Sixth Lady to a feast.

567
00:33:15,616 --> 00:33:17,696
Is Her Highness interested
in Sixth Lady?

568
00:33:18,337 --> 00:33:19,337
If this is true,

569
00:33:19,337 --> 00:33:21,616
- that would be marvelous.
- Exactly.

570
00:33:22,017 --> 00:33:22,696
If so, we...

571
00:33:22,696 --> 00:33:24,057
Stop talking nonsense!

572
00:33:24,216 --> 00:33:25,537
Don't you dare spread fake news!

573
00:33:33,616 --> 00:33:34,416
Mother,

574
00:33:34,737 --> 00:33:35,696
how did you know

575
00:33:35,696 --> 00:33:37,337
I was acquainted with Mr. Han?

576
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,599
The Princess Royal sent
some pastries the other day,

577
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:41,940
saying it was a token of gratitude.

578
00:33:41,984 --> 00:33:43,770
I know you wouldn't do anything

579
00:33:43,777 --> 00:33:44,936
inappropriate,

580
00:33:45,097 --> 00:33:46,257
so I didn't ask you.

581
00:33:46,696 --> 00:33:48,337
Are you talking about

582
00:33:48,337 --> 00:33:50,456
the beautifully wrapped pastries
you gave me?

583
00:33:52,057 --> 00:33:53,216
The Princess Royal

584
00:33:53,216 --> 00:33:54,656
is the late Emperor's sister

585
00:33:54,936 --> 00:33:56,656
and His Majesty's aunt.

586
00:33:57,337 --> 00:33:59,257
She has a lofty status.

587
00:33:59,376 --> 00:34:00,456
From now on,

588
00:34:00,456 --> 00:34:02,777
you should stay close to Mr. Han.

589
00:34:02,777 --> 00:34:04,057
It'll benefit you.

590
00:34:04,257 --> 00:34:05,216
What benefits?

591
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:07,097
Can I eat more delicious food?

592
00:34:09,176 --> 00:34:10,537
Mr. Han says

593
00:34:10,696 --> 00:34:12,097
his appetite improves

594
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:13,857
when he sees you.

595
00:34:14,057 --> 00:34:15,696
You're a kind girl.

596
00:34:15,736 --> 00:34:17,537
You'll want to help him, right?

597
00:34:17,736 --> 00:34:19,897
His appetite improves when he sees me?

598
00:34:19,977 --> 00:34:22,017
That sounds weird.

599
00:34:23,552 --> 00:34:24,873
Just help him.

600
00:34:25,232 --> 00:34:26,930
That's strange.
How could there be someone

601
00:34:26,937 --> 00:34:28,336
who doesn't enjoy eating?

602
00:34:37,977 --> 00:34:39,696
Right, everything's here.

603
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:41,620
I'll make sure everything is prepared

604
00:34:41,626 --> 00:34:43,266
as you instructed, Seventh Lady.

605
00:34:43,696 --> 00:34:44,616
But

606
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:46,280
do we have to bring
the medicine ourselves?

607
00:34:46,721 --> 00:34:47,561
Of course.

608
00:34:47,665 --> 00:34:49,265
In case Third Brother catches a cold.

609
00:34:49,336 --> 00:34:51,497
It's better to have
the medicine on hand.

610
00:34:51,497 --> 00:34:53,535
Besides, its name also
sounds auspicious.

611
00:34:53,536 --> 00:34:54,650
It works. It works. It works.

612
00:34:54,736 --> 00:34:57,176
Maybe Third Brother will become
the triple top scorer.

613
00:34:57,592 --> 00:34:59,353
You have excellent foresight,
Seventh Lady.

614
00:35:00,097 --> 00:35:00,937
Xue Zhi,

615
00:35:00,937 --> 00:35:02,377
prepare more charcoal.

616
00:35:02,537 --> 00:35:03,497
This autumn

617
00:35:03,497 --> 00:35:05,336
is colder than before.

618
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:07,937
We can't let Third Brother catch a cold
at the exam hall.

619
00:35:07,937 --> 00:35:09,937
All right, Young Lady.
It's all prepared.

620
00:35:09,937 --> 00:35:11,537
You reminded me several times.

621
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:16,537
I heard that you are

622
00:35:16,776 --> 00:35:18,857
investigating the Chen Family.

623
00:35:20,371 --> 00:35:21,251
Does the poisoning

624
00:35:21,377 --> 00:35:22,776
have anything to do
with Madam Chen?

625
00:35:24,736 --> 00:35:25,537
Not her.

626
00:35:29,816 --> 00:35:31,696
Why can't you tell me?

627
00:35:32,937 --> 00:35:34,497
You're preparing for the exam.

628
00:35:34,656 --> 00:35:36,057
I don't want to distract you.

629
00:35:39,097 --> 00:35:40,097
Besides,

630
00:35:40,097 --> 00:35:41,696
that's just speculation.

631
00:35:41,816 --> 00:35:43,296
I haven't found any proof yet.

632
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,057
Third Brother.

633
00:35:48,192 --> 00:35:49,472
- Fifth Lady.
- Fifth Lady.

634
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,610
Greetings, Third Brother.

635
00:35:52,897 --> 00:35:54,176
You're here, too, Seventh Sister.

636
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,840
Why are you here

637
00:35:55,857 --> 00:35:57,857
to visit Third Brother at this hour?

638
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:00,736
The exam is approaching.

639
00:36:00,977 --> 00:36:02,897
We have several candidates

640
00:36:02,897 --> 00:36:04,216
in this residence,

641
00:36:04,216 --> 00:36:05,857
so I made a few pairs of shoes.

642
00:36:05,977 --> 00:36:08,136
I have brought them
to Shan and Sixth Uncle.

643
00:36:08,136 --> 00:36:08,857
And now,

644
00:36:09,097 --> 00:36:10,696
I'm sending Third Brother a pair.

645
00:36:10,696 --> 00:36:12,336
I hope you would like them.

646
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:13,256
Thank you, Fifth Sister.

647
00:36:16,017 --> 00:36:17,736
Did Madam Lin send this here?

648
00:36:17,937 --> 00:36:20,256
Xuan has a similar set of these.

649
00:36:20,287 --> 00:36:21,876
Madam Lin is truly considerate.

650
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,140
The things from Wanglou Pavilion

651
00:36:23,336 --> 00:36:24,296
are certainly refined.

652
00:36:24,656 --> 00:36:25,457
Xue Zhi,

653
00:36:25,696 --> 00:36:27,656
take the things Third Brother needs
for the exam

654
00:36:27,816 --> 00:36:29,256
to Haitang Abode.

655
00:36:29,616 --> 00:36:31,336
Let's not disturb his studying.

656
00:36:31,570 --> 00:36:32,451
Yes, Young Lady.

657
00:36:34,497 --> 00:36:35,656
I should get going.

658
00:36:35,857 --> 00:36:37,776
I wish you the best of luck on the exam.

659
00:36:45,897 --> 00:36:47,736
Young Lady, I gathered

660
00:36:47,736 --> 00:36:49,616
that the Fifth Lady
has been friendly lately.

661
00:36:49,616 --> 00:36:51,256
She also sends gifts to all the abodes.

662
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:53,810
I didn't expect her to send some
to the Third Young Master as well.

663
00:36:54,017 --> 00:36:56,136
Did you believe she came here
just to send gifts?

664
00:36:56,577 --> 00:36:57,897
If not,

665
00:36:58,136 --> 00:36:59,296
what is it, then?

666
00:36:59,577 --> 00:37:01,017
I think the Fifth Sister will soon

667
00:37:01,176 --> 00:37:03,457
pay a visit to Haitang Abode.

668
00:37:11,136 --> 00:37:11,897
Young Lady.

669
00:37:18,816 --> 00:37:20,417
Is it done?

670
00:37:20,736 --> 00:37:23,497
Are you sure you want to do this,
Young Lady?

671
00:37:33,937 --> 00:37:35,417
I will never allow anyone

672
00:37:35,417 --> 00:37:36,616
to get in Xuan's way.

673
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,407
(Haitang Abode)

674
00:37:43,696 --> 00:37:44,537
Fifth Lady,

675
00:37:45,136 --> 00:37:46,497
unfortunately,

676
00:37:46,616 --> 00:37:49,136
Seventh Lady has gone
to greet Old Madam.

677
00:37:51,136 --> 00:37:51,897
It's fine.

678
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:53,736
I'll wait for her inside.

679
00:37:58,736 --> 00:38:00,609
This sweet cake is made
by Fifth Lady.

680
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:02,000
We have sent some
to all the abodes.

681
00:38:02,097 --> 00:38:04,057
These are for Seventh Lady.

682
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:06,696
I'm thirsty.

683
00:38:07,537 --> 00:38:08,817
Serve me some tea.

684
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:10,336
Yes.

685
00:38:23,537 --> 00:38:24,497
Young Lady, you're back.

686
00:38:26,017 --> 00:38:26,897
What is this?

687
00:38:28,057 --> 00:38:30,537
The Fifth Lady sent some sweet cake over
earlier today.

688
00:38:30,696 --> 00:38:31,776
How long was she here?

689
00:38:32,417 --> 00:38:33,897
As you ordered,

690
00:38:34,017 --> 00:38:35,537
I didn't stay and watch her.

691
00:38:35,537 --> 00:38:36,897
She asked me to brew some tea,

692
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:37,977
so I did.

693
00:38:38,057 --> 00:38:40,537
However, she only took
a few sips and left.

694
00:38:52,937 --> 00:38:54,537
Young Lady, do you suspect
Fifth Lady

695
00:38:54,537 --> 00:38:57,097
would temper with the thing
prepared by Madam Lin?

696
00:38:58,457 --> 00:39:00,937
Fifth Sister must be wary
of Third Brother's talent,

697
00:39:00,937 --> 00:39:02,417
that's why she was planning something.

698
00:39:03,136 --> 00:39:04,457
Plus, she hates Mother.

699
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:06,473
She wouldn't miss
such a perfect opportunity

700
00:39:06,537 --> 00:39:08,057
to frame both of them together.

701
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,440
(Caifu Abode)

702
00:39:16,845 --> 00:39:18,645
Who disturbs my sleep?

703
00:39:20,417 --> 00:39:21,897
It's morning.
Why are you not up yet?

704
00:39:23,417 --> 00:39:25,017
Let me sleep a little longer.

705
00:39:25,017 --> 00:39:26,417
Sleep? You have the exam today.

706
00:39:26,417 --> 00:39:27,537
Don't be late.

707
00:39:27,776 --> 00:39:28,897
Too loud.

708
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:32,897
Hairu!

709
00:39:33,336 --> 00:39:34,136
Are you awake now?

710
00:39:35,537 --> 00:39:36,457
I am.

711
00:39:45,336 --> 00:39:46,537
Shan, come.

712
00:39:46,736 --> 00:39:47,537
Mother.

713
00:39:47,537 --> 00:39:49,656
I have prepared three sets
of writing supplies.

714
00:39:49,656 --> 00:39:50,857
They're all here.

715
00:39:52,256 --> 00:39:53,457
Don't leave anything behind.

716
00:39:53,457 --> 00:39:55,216
Keep this one with you.

717
00:39:55,497 --> 00:39:56,656
All right.

718
00:40:01,072 --> 00:40:03,390
Didn't you say there would
be a roasted chicken? Where is it?

719
00:40:03,897 --> 00:40:06,057
It's all inside here.

720
00:40:08,616 --> 00:40:09,417
Oh, my.

721
00:40:09,417 --> 00:40:11,216
You didn't just drop the brushes.

722
00:40:11,216 --> 00:40:12,176
It's bad luck.

723
00:40:12,176 --> 00:40:13,176
You picked them up.

724
00:40:13,176 --> 00:40:14,336
They are all right.

725
00:40:15,696 --> 00:40:17,497
I'll keep them properly. My bad.

726
00:40:39,897 --> 00:40:41,377
Xuan, drink some.

727
00:40:41,776 --> 00:40:43,329
I prepared this pig knuckle congee

728
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:44,990
before the sky turned bright
this morning.

729
00:40:45,008 --> 00:40:45,690
Please drink some.

730
00:40:45,696 --> 00:40:46,736
It'll bring you good luck.

731
00:40:55,616 --> 00:40:57,537
Young Lady, you've checked it
three times.

732
00:40:57,537 --> 00:40:58,656
There's no mistake.

733
00:40:59,977 --> 00:41:01,616
We must make sure
everything is all right.

734
00:41:01,937 --> 00:41:04,216
Don't worry. It's already ready.

735
00:41:07,897 --> 00:41:09,057
Just do the best you can

736
00:41:09,457 --> 00:41:11,017
in the exam.

737
00:41:11,256 --> 00:41:13,736
Read the question carefully.
Don't be hasty.

738
00:41:15,377 --> 00:41:16,176
Second Master,

739
00:41:16,616 --> 00:41:17,457
I have prepared them

740
00:41:17,457 --> 00:41:18,937
with the things they need for the exam.

741
00:41:19,216 --> 00:41:20,977
It's my first time preparing those.

742
00:41:21,176 --> 00:41:23,577
Could you check if I've missed anything?

743
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,279
Bring them here.

744
00:41:46,336 --> 00:41:47,336
Where's Xuanyuan's?

745
00:42:12,937 --> 00:42:14,457
Why are there candles here?

746
00:42:19,176 --> 00:42:21,057
What's that inside the candles?

747
00:42:37,897 --> 00:42:38,816
