=The Rise of Ning=

00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,320
(Adapted from Wen Tan's novel "Chancellor
Training Handbook" from Jinjiang Literature)

3
00:01:36,673 --> 00:01:38,853
=Episode 23=

4
00:01:42,158 --> 00:01:44,438
Duke Ying, you came all the way
to the royal bedchamber

5
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:45,559
with a military report in hand

6
00:01:45,679 --> 00:01:47,839
just so you could request
an imperial decree

7
00:01:48,158 --> 00:01:50,998
for some military intel, huh?

8
00:01:51,296 --> 00:01:53,350
Aren't you afraid
that His Majesty might be enraged?

9
00:01:53,424 --> 00:01:55,536
Executive Vice Minister,
you're being worried for nothing.

10
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:57,479
There's a situation at the border area.

11
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:00,238
And military supplies have been
insufficient for the past year.

12
00:02:00,238 --> 00:02:02,479
I'm worried. Therefore,
I can't help but blurt out the truth.

13
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:03,078
Luckily,

14
00:02:03,798 --> 00:02:05,199
His Majesty is wise.

15
00:02:05,199 --> 00:02:07,078
He knew that I did so
for the sake of the state.

16
00:02:07,158 --> 00:02:08,358
Why would he punish me for this?

17
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,518
Duke Ying, seems like

18
00:02:10,518 --> 00:02:12,798
you're unsatisfied with the Chancellery.

19
00:02:13,279 --> 00:02:14,279
Indeed.

20
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,518
The National Treasury
is quite empty this year.

21
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:18,558
I was helpless about it as well.

22
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:19,798
For the past few days,

23
00:02:20,078 --> 00:02:21,829
I've been trying to gather

24
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:23,120
all the military funds I can find.

25
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:23,790
Excellent.

26
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:25,309
If so, Executive Vice Minister,

27
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:26,832
I'll leave
the military supplies to you.

28
00:02:26,912 --> 00:02:28,272
Duke Ying, you're being too courteous.

29
00:02:30,118 --> 00:02:30,919
However,

30
00:02:31,838 --> 00:02:33,999
Duke Ying, I knew
you brought the military intel with you.

31
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:35,199
But how is this related

32
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:38,798
to Chen Jiuheng's case?

33
00:02:38,798 --> 00:02:40,999
Why did His Majesty forbid me

34
00:02:41,279 --> 00:02:42,638
from participating in the case?

35
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:44,719
Have I done

36
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,518
anything wrong?

37
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:48,118
I don't know about that.

38
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:50,464
Executive Vice Minister,

39
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:53,719
why don't you ask
His Majesty about it directly?

40
00:02:54,838 --> 00:02:56,919
How can we doubt the ruler's intention?

41
00:02:57,798 --> 00:02:58,599
You do have a point.

42
00:03:00,039 --> 00:03:00,999
Executive Vice Minister,

43
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:02,439
I assume His Majesty thinks

44
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:04,190
that you've been too busy
with state affairs.

45
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:05,558
Therefore, he doesn't want you

46
00:03:05,558 --> 00:03:07,199
to worry about such trivial affairs.

47
00:03:10,039 --> 00:03:10,838
That'll do as well.

48
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:12,279
If so, Duke Ying,

49
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,358
I'll leave this case to you.

50
00:03:15,078 --> 00:03:17,719
Naturally, I'll do my best.

51
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:20,958
I'll wait for your good news, then.

52
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:22,759
There'll definitely be good news.

53
00:03:38,784 --> 00:03:40,040
I've used this medicine on them.

54
00:03:40,144 --> 00:03:42,464
Although it isn't as good
as the previous one you gave me,

55
00:03:42,496 --> 00:03:44,672
it's much better than the medicine
found on the market.

56
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,416
They adjusted the formula
and reduced the cost.

57
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,400
Naturally, they did so

58
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,136
to bring greater benefits
to the common people.

59
00:03:53,152 --> 00:03:53,584
Yeah.

60
00:03:53,678 --> 00:03:54,838
The person who invented

61
00:03:54,838 --> 00:03:56,199
this medicine is a genius indeed.

62
00:03:56,496 --> 00:03:57,392
By the way, Shenyuan,

63
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,832
you can see if that person has any other

64
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:00,016
useful prescriptions available.

65
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,199
If he's willing,

66
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,999
we can operate an apothecary together.

67
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:04,518
I feel the same.

68
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,952
I'll ask him about it later.

69
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:06,798
Okay.

70
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:08,118
Young Master!

71
00:04:09,759 --> 00:04:11,039
Young Master, we received news!

72
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:16,358
His Majesty has issued a decree.

73
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:18,430
The Imperial Court of Judicial
will reopen Master's case.

74
00:04:18,438 --> 00:04:19,599
Duke Ying will review the case.

75
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,200
Wang Yuan will
not participate in the case.

76
00:04:21,248 --> 00:04:22,048
This is great!

77
00:04:22,318 --> 00:04:24,358
Duke Ying is just and righteous indeed.

78
00:04:24,656 --> 00:04:26,190
I'm sure Duke Ying leaked the testimony

79
00:04:26,198 --> 00:04:27,358
for His Majesty to see.

80
00:04:27,878 --> 00:04:29,238
Although it's not concrete,

81
00:04:29,238 --> 00:04:30,758
His Majesty always hated those

82
00:04:30,768 --> 00:04:32,080
who profit from national crises.

83
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:34,198
Therefore, he's doubtful of Wang Yuan.

84
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,318
Shenyuan, it's all thanks to your plan.

85
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,959
Now, Daoyan is out of danger.

86
00:04:39,072 --> 00:04:40,704
There's hope
for overturning the case now.

87
00:04:40,719 --> 00:04:42,198
But they won't let us off that easily.

88
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,296
Keep a close eye on them.

89
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:44,608
Yes, Young Master.

90
00:04:53,599 --> 00:04:54,839
Congratulations, Madam Lin.

91
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:56,198
Thank you.

92
00:04:56,358 --> 00:04:57,798
Rui Xiang, welcome our guests.

93
00:04:57,798 --> 00:04:58,519
Yes, Madam.

94
00:04:58,592 --> 00:04:59,392
Let's go.

95
00:04:59,438 --> 00:05:00,358
- Thank you.
- Okay.

96
00:05:00,839 --> 00:05:01,998
Congratulations, Madam Lin.

97
00:05:01,998 --> 00:05:02,358
Thank you.

98
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:04,672
Please come inside.

99
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:06,150
Congratulations, Madam Lin.

100
00:05:06,159 --> 00:05:07,669
Duchess Xu, Madam Gao,

101
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:08,672
you guys are here as well.

102
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,519
I've invited the best acrobatic troupe

103
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:11,839
in the city to perform here today.

104
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:13,479
Please enjoy yourselves later.

105
00:05:13,878 --> 00:05:15,719
Madam Lin, you're revered indeed.

106
00:05:15,998 --> 00:05:17,919
That acrobatic troupe
is difficult to hire.

107
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,584
I've invited several madams

108
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,310
to go boating on the lake
in a few more days.

109
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:23,279
Madam Lin, why don't you

110
00:05:23,318 --> 00:05:24,839
join us?

111
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:26,959
Sure. I'll definitely show up.

112
00:05:36,198 --> 00:05:37,599
Madam, don't be angry.

113
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:39,599
Her Highness will be coming today.

114
00:05:39,998 --> 00:05:40,998
Madam,

115
00:05:40,998 --> 00:05:42,639
why don't we go and receive her outside?

116
00:05:42,678 --> 00:05:45,198
We'll be Her Highness's in-laws
in the future.

117
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:47,798
We'll be much more glamorous than her.

118
00:05:50,599 --> 00:05:51,079
Let's go.

119
00:05:52,998 --> 00:05:55,438
The Top Scholar Feast
should've been held long ago

120
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,758
if it weren't for my ailment.

121
00:05:58,039 --> 00:06:00,919
Shenyuan feeds me medicine
every day as well.

122
00:06:01,159 --> 00:06:03,438
As his mother, I've let him down.

123
00:06:03,998 --> 00:06:07,159
Yuan is indeed a filial child.

124
00:06:09,153 --> 00:06:11,159
Madam Lin, our family is...

125
00:06:11,678 --> 00:06:12,479
Madam Lin,

126
00:06:12,678 --> 00:06:14,318
I have a niece in Xuzhou.

127
00:06:14,558 --> 00:06:15,839
She's beautiful and cute.

128
00:06:16,159 --> 00:06:17,798
She's great at needlework as well.

129
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:20,719
Her grandpa
is the prefect of Xuzhou.

130
00:06:20,998 --> 00:06:22,118
If that sounds nice to you,

131
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:23,936
why don't we compare
their Eight Characters?

132
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,678
Even Duchess Xu is in a hurry

133
00:06:28,678 --> 00:06:30,318
to butter Madam Lin up.

134
00:06:30,438 --> 00:06:32,599
Third Young Master
is highly sought after right now.

135
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:34,558
I heard from Grandma

136
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,079
that Duke Xu was close to our family

137
00:06:37,318 --> 00:06:38,358
before this.

138
00:06:38,998 --> 00:06:41,358
But he stopped visiting us

139
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:42,839
after Grandpa's passing.

140
00:06:43,198 --> 00:06:45,678
He thinks
that our family has lost influence.

141
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:49,438
He was just flattering those in power.

142
00:06:52,998 --> 00:06:54,639
Old Madam said

143
00:06:54,678 --> 00:06:57,438
Yuan needs to prioritize his studies.

144
00:06:57,678 --> 00:07:00,159
He still needs to attend
the imperial and the palace examination.

145
00:07:00,159 --> 00:07:02,318
As for other affairs,
we have to be put aside for now.

146
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:04,919
Although that's the case,

147
00:07:04,998 --> 00:07:07,919
one's marriage
is an important event in life.

148
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:09,639
If we can arrange one
for them in advance,

149
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:12,159
Yuan can focus on his studies
without being distracted.

150
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:15,039
Old Madam's words

151
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,159
are absolute.

152
00:07:16,558 --> 00:07:18,558
Since she already said so,

153
00:07:18,558 --> 00:07:19,919
we have to obey her.

154
00:07:20,438 --> 00:07:22,079
We shouldn't go against her will.

155
00:07:22,238 --> 00:07:23,639
Don't you agree?

156
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,118
Yeah, you do have a point.

157
00:07:26,318 --> 00:07:27,758
Guys, please go inside.

158
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:31,198
Mother is getting better

159
00:07:31,279 --> 00:07:32,678
at dealing with such situations.

160
00:07:49,872 --> 00:07:51,152
Are you admiring the flowers?

161
00:07:52,107 --> 00:07:52,748
Third Brother?

162
00:07:53,998 --> 00:07:56,198
All of them came here because of you.

163
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:57,959
You came here to hide from them

164
00:07:58,039 --> 00:07:59,639
instead of entertaining them.

165
00:08:00,318 --> 00:08:01,358
I can't deal with

166
00:08:01,998 --> 00:08:03,159
such lively situations.

167
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:05,758
Shenyuan.

168
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,704
- Mr. Sun has arrived.
- Hold this.

169
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:12,998
Greetings, Mr. Sun.

170
00:08:13,998 --> 00:08:14,839
Excellent.

171
00:08:15,284 --> 00:08:16,443
You've become the top scholar.

172
00:08:16,599 --> 00:08:18,678
As your teacher, I feel honored as well.

173
00:08:20,159 --> 00:08:22,629
Wan'er, this is Luo Shenyuan,
the top scholar

174
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,000
whom I've mentioned to you before.

175
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:24,959
Go and greet him.

176
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,720
Third Young Master Luo.

177
00:08:33,239 --> 00:08:34,919
Father has been praising you constantly

178
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,759
ever since he met you.

179
00:08:36,912 --> 00:08:38,590
He's never done
something like that before.

180
00:08:38,592 --> 00:08:40,160
She's upset
that I held you in high regard.

181
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,369
She read the verses you wrote,

182
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:42,840
and wanted to meet you in person.

183
00:08:42,848 --> 00:08:44,640
Today, she finally
gets to meet you in person.

184
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,159
This must be Seventh Lady.

185
00:08:46,478 --> 00:08:47,438
I remember you.

186
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:50,239
Greetings, Mr. Sun, Young Lady Sun.

187
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:51,798
Greetings, Seventh Lady.

188
00:08:53,264 --> 00:08:55,150
Top Scholar, the verses
you wrote were excellent.

189
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:57,100
I never expected you
to be good at writing essays too.

190
00:08:57,104 --> 00:08:58,144
If there's an opportunity,

191
00:08:58,239 --> 00:08:59,598
we can have a discussion.

192
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,519
Don't overestimate yourself.

193
00:09:01,798 --> 00:09:02,838
Shenyuan's essays

194
00:09:03,159 --> 00:09:04,598
are famous in the palace.

195
00:09:04,999 --> 00:09:06,039
You can't compare to him.

196
00:09:07,239 --> 00:09:07,879
In the palace?

197
00:09:08,478 --> 00:09:09,718
Shenyuan wrote a policy essay

198
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:12,159
that was highly regarded
by everyone who read it.

199
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:14,224
His Majesty wanted to read it
upon hearing the news.

200
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:14,950
He said

201
00:09:15,318 --> 00:09:16,759
that his words were pearls of wisdom.

202
00:09:19,478 --> 00:09:21,279
How could Shenyuan
receive His Majesty's praise

203
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,759
with his limited knowledge?

204
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:26,318
I'm so afraid.

205
00:09:27,838 --> 00:09:29,838
Yuan, now that
you have left an impression

206
00:09:29,838 --> 00:09:30,678
on His Majesty,

207
00:09:30,798 --> 00:09:33,359
you should prepare yourself
for the next examination.

208
00:09:33,558 --> 00:09:35,598
Do not let His Majesty down.

209
00:09:36,759 --> 00:09:38,598
Yes, Mr. Sun.

210
00:10:03,438 --> 00:10:04,759
Yixiu

211
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,078
has been studying

212
00:10:07,078 --> 00:10:08,838
the new recipes you gave her.

213
00:10:08,838 --> 00:10:10,519
She said they were interesting.

214
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:14,519
I've never seen her paying
that much attention to something.

215
00:10:14,838 --> 00:10:16,669
Sixth Lady is born a food connoisseur.

216
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:18,048
We have an affinity with each other.

217
00:10:18,838 --> 00:10:20,159
My eldest son is bizarre.

218
00:10:20,198 --> 00:10:21,678
No matter how delicious my cooking was,

219
00:10:21,678 --> 00:10:22,919
he never cared about them.

220
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,919
But he'll develop an appetite

221
00:10:25,078 --> 00:10:26,718
whenever he sees Sixth Lady eating.

222
00:10:27,798 --> 00:10:28,958
Forget it.

223
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:30,279
His future wife

224
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:31,639
can look after him.

225
00:10:35,879 --> 00:10:36,798
I wonder

226
00:10:37,078 --> 00:10:39,639
which girl is lucky enough

227
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:41,519
to be Your Highness's daughter-in-law?

228
00:10:43,359 --> 00:10:44,838
I don't care

229
00:10:44,838 --> 00:10:45,999
which family she comes from.

230
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:48,558
It's good as long as
she can help my son develop an appetite.

231
00:10:48,558 --> 00:10:49,798
The rest don't matter.

232
00:10:56,798 --> 00:10:58,509
Zhao entered the palace yesterday

233
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:00,400
and let the imperial cooks
prepare some snacks.

234
00:11:00,432 --> 00:11:01,664
He was in a hurry to look

235
00:11:01,712 --> 00:11:03,328
for Sixth Lady upon arriving here.

236
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:06,912
The residence is so lively today.

237
00:11:06,928 --> 00:11:08,070
Look at how crowded it is.

238
00:11:11,119 --> 00:11:11,919
Sixth Lady.

239
00:11:14,999 --> 00:11:16,078
Greetings, Mr. Han.

240
00:11:18,159 --> 00:11:19,519
The imperial cooks of Yangzhong

241
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:20,279
made these snacks.

242
00:11:20,478 --> 00:11:21,198
Please try them.

243
00:11:22,999 --> 00:11:23,958
Thank you, Mr. Han.

244
00:11:24,272 --> 00:11:25,990
But I don't have much
of an appetite lately.

245
00:11:25,999 --> 00:11:28,279
Please do not deliver
food to our residence again.

246
00:11:28,838 --> 00:11:29,519
Let's go.

247
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:30,879
Come on.

248
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:37,958
Which family is that guy from?

249
00:11:42,558 --> 00:11:44,159
That's

250
00:11:45,478 --> 00:11:48,519
the younger brother of Madam Lin,
wife of Second Master Luo.

251
00:11:51,838 --> 00:11:53,078
When it comes to seniority,

252
00:11:53,558 --> 00:11:56,039
Yixiu should address him as Uncle.

253
00:12:03,198 --> 00:12:04,558
They're getting along well

254
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,838
even though he's not her real uncle.

255
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:09,159
Sixth Lady is obedient indeed.

256
00:12:10,558 --> 00:12:12,838
Your Highness, you flatter her.

257
00:12:19,999 --> 00:12:20,879
Old Madam Luo.

258
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:24,359
Congratulations, Old Madam Luo.

259
00:12:24,678 --> 00:12:25,678
Not at all.

260
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:27,838
Your eldest son passed
the examination as well.

261
00:12:27,838 --> 00:12:29,519
We should celebrate
this occasion together.

262
00:12:29,759 --> 00:12:31,999
Since all of us are here,

263
00:12:31,999 --> 00:12:33,759
we should celebrate
the occasion merrily.

264
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:34,639
Indeed.

265
00:12:34,678 --> 00:12:37,318
My eldest son was fortunate enough
to pass the examination as well.

266
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,598
It's almost time for him
to marry as well.

267
00:12:39,838 --> 00:12:41,958
Old Madam Luo, what do you think about

268
00:12:41,999 --> 00:12:43,198
the proposal I mentioned before?

269
00:12:45,078 --> 00:12:47,318
Your son, Liu, is virtuous and educated.

270
00:12:47,438 --> 00:12:49,318
Naturally, I like him.

271
00:12:49,598 --> 00:12:52,598
My eldest son has fallen for
your eldest granddaughter.

272
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:53,999
He insists on marrying her.

273
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:57,359
That's a blessing for Yiyu.

274
00:12:58,159 --> 00:12:59,558
But regarding that,

275
00:12:59,558 --> 00:13:02,359
I have to discuss it
with her mother first.

276
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,318
I cannot make the call here.

277
00:13:04,438 --> 00:13:05,318
Yes, Old Madam Luo.

278
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,798
Old Madam, Her Highness has arrived.

279
00:13:15,999 --> 00:13:16,949
Greetings, Your Highness.

280
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:18,624
Old Madam Luo,
please spare the formalities.

281
00:13:19,078 --> 00:13:21,438
I'm just here to enjoy the fun.

282
00:13:22,608 --> 00:13:24,416
You guys should stop being so courteous.

283
00:13:25,039 --> 00:13:27,078
Your Highness,
we won't bother you, then.

284
00:13:27,318 --> 00:13:28,359
Your Highness,

285
00:13:28,359 --> 00:13:30,239
I'll tend to the ladies.

286
00:13:32,359 --> 00:13:33,879
Old Madam Luo, how have you been?

287
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:36,269
Since when did the Luo Family

288
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:37,792
get this close to the imperial family?

289
00:13:37,792 --> 00:13:38,910
Haven't you heard?

290
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:41,040
Her Highness
has taken a liking to Sixth Lady.

291
00:13:41,088 --> 00:13:43,590
The two families
have been very close lately.

292
00:13:43,798 --> 00:13:45,718
You mean the chubby girl?

293
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,440
She's truly fortunate indeed.

294
00:13:49,838 --> 00:13:50,958
Madam Shen, be careful.

295
00:13:51,239 --> 00:13:52,239
I'm fine.

296
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:53,678
The tea has gotten cold.

297
00:13:53,678 --> 00:13:55,359
I'll instruct my men
to change it for you.

298
00:13:56,759 --> 00:13:58,838
First Lady, you're intelligent

299
00:13:58,838 --> 00:13:59,999
and elegant indeed.

300
00:14:00,159 --> 00:14:01,999
First Lady, I heard

301
00:14:02,078 --> 00:14:03,958
that you're an excellent musician.

302
00:14:05,648 --> 00:14:08,310
It's a shame that I won't get
the chance to enjoy your performance.

303
00:14:09,999 --> 00:14:12,349
Music is merely another
secondary skill for women like us.

304
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,696
I dare not present my shortcomings.

305
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,958
Madam Shen, your dress looks amazing.

306
00:14:15,999 --> 00:14:17,869
It matches
the sky-blue tea cup perfectly.

307
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:19,328
It looks like a scene from a painting.

308
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:30,639
Seems like Madam Shen likes you.

309
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:33,838
Madam Liu was also talking about

310
00:14:33,838 --> 00:14:35,598
my marriage with Grandma just now.

311
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:37,759
And, Mr. Liu had passed
this examination too.

312
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:39,639
Don't be silly.

313
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:41,678
The head of the Shen Family is a count.

314
00:14:41,678 --> 00:14:43,318
The Liu Family can't compare to them.

315
00:14:43,639 --> 00:14:45,558
Besides, Shen Yu,
the son of the Shen Family,

316
00:14:45,558 --> 00:14:47,279
is also at the age when
he should marry soon.

317
00:14:47,838 --> 00:14:48,639
As for you,

318
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:52,159
you just need to please Madam Shen.

319
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,239
You don't need to care about the rest.

320
00:14:56,919 --> 00:14:58,159
Is that Third Young Master Luo?

321
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:02,678
He's so handsome.

322
00:15:02,798 --> 00:15:03,159
Yeah.

323
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:03,798
He's so dashing.

324
00:15:06,078 --> 00:15:07,718
My goodness. He's so dashing.

325
00:15:14,678 --> 00:15:15,478
Look.

326
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:17,999
Young Lady Sun has her sights on you.

327
00:15:22,678 --> 00:15:24,718
I think she likes you.

328
00:15:26,838 --> 00:15:27,759
You're overthinking it.

329
00:15:28,359 --> 00:15:30,279
Mr. Sun is very knowledgeable.

330
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:32,359
Young Lady Sun is talented

331
00:15:32,478 --> 00:15:33,879
and beautiful as well.

332
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:36,198
- Don't tell me you don't like her?
- I don't.

333
00:15:36,678 --> 00:15:38,159
There are so many ladies here today.

334
00:15:38,159 --> 00:15:39,958
Let me review them on your behalf.

335
00:15:40,119 --> 00:15:40,598
Look.

336
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:43,678
What do you think about the lady
in the red dress?

337
00:15:44,078 --> 00:15:46,598
She's tall, slender,
and has striking features.

338
00:15:47,239 --> 00:15:49,438
Noble ladies like her
are usually arrogant and overbearing.

339
00:15:49,598 --> 00:15:51,879
What about the lady
in the blue dress, then?

340
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:54,759
She's graceful and beautiful.

341
00:15:56,359 --> 00:15:58,519
She's delicate with
no hints of grandeur.

342
00:15:58,519 --> 00:16:00,879
You're insulting them
without taking a look at them.

343
00:16:01,359 --> 00:16:03,078
They're here to attend the feast.

344
00:16:03,078 --> 00:16:04,759
They're not here for my selection.

345
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:13,318
I'm just curious about

346
00:16:13,359 --> 00:16:15,078
the type of lady you like.

347
00:16:16,752 --> 00:16:17,750
Do you truly wish to know?

348
00:16:20,704 --> 00:16:22,070
Someone who's slightly mischievous,

349
00:16:22,478 --> 00:16:24,159
decisive, has her own opinions,

350
00:16:24,519 --> 00:16:26,159
kind, and virtuous.

351
00:16:26,159 --> 00:16:28,598
If someone treats her well,
she'll return the favor 100 times.

352
00:16:28,838 --> 00:16:29,519
Stop right there.

353
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,519
Third Brother,

354
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:34,519
don't tell me
you have someone you fancy?

355
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:35,264
That's right.

356
00:16:36,159 --> 00:16:36,999
Who is it?

357
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,424
- Have I met her before?
- Not only have you met her before,

358
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:40,416
but you also know her.

359
00:16:41,838 --> 00:16:44,318
You should stop pairing me up
with someone else.

360
00:16:44,999 --> 00:16:46,438
She's the only woman

361
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,078
I'll marry in this lifetime.

362
00:16:49,598 --> 00:16:50,718
Don't tell me

363
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:52,598
that the lady you fancy
is already engaged?

364
00:16:52,798 --> 00:16:54,519
Tell me.
I'll think of a solution for you.

365
00:16:54,519 --> 00:16:56,438
Enough already.
Stop making wild guesses.

366
00:16:57,104 --> 00:16:58,864
Those who came here
to form a marital alliance

367
00:16:59,798 --> 00:17:01,078
all came in hopes

368
00:17:01,078 --> 00:17:02,759
that I could pass the examination

369
00:17:02,816 --> 00:17:04,512
and become an official in the future.

370
00:17:04,576 --> 00:17:06,310
What if I'm still a son

371
00:17:06,678 --> 00:17:08,919
who isn't acknowledged by
the Luo Family?

372
00:17:09,238 --> 00:17:10,319
Who else besides you

373
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:11,998
will hold me in high regard?

374
00:17:11,998 --> 00:17:13,079
Of course there is.

375
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:14,688
Third Brother, you're a great person.

376
00:17:14,758 --> 00:17:16,998
I'm sure someone will come here
for your character alone.

377
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,159
Is that so?

378
00:17:20,438 --> 00:17:21,198
This is for you.

379
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:35,799
Marquis Anbei has arrived!

380
00:17:37,159 --> 00:17:38,269
What is he doing here again?

381
00:17:38,270 --> 00:17:39,952
Someone who would come here for me

382
00:17:40,478 --> 00:17:41,319
has arrived.

383
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,230
What is he doing here?
Did you invite him here?

384
00:17:49,238 --> 00:17:50,958
I dare not invite such a major figure.

385
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:54,799
Hurry!

386
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:01,718
Registrar Luo,

387
00:18:03,238 --> 00:18:04,919
I came here without an invitation.

388
00:18:05,319 --> 00:18:07,198
Please don't blame me for this.

389
00:18:07,198 --> 00:18:08,319
I dare not do so.

390
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,639
Marquis Lu, I'm surprised

391
00:18:10,678 --> 00:18:12,678
and flattered by your presence.

392
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,340
Isn't that Marquis Lu

393
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,300
and Duke Ying's daughter?

394
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,621
The Luo Family merely
has a top scholar in the family.

395
00:18:18,701 --> 00:18:20,421
Why are such major figures here as well?

396
00:18:20,752 --> 00:18:21,740
Where's the top scholar?

397
00:18:22,352 --> 00:18:24,300
You guys shouldn't
belittle the top scholar.

398
00:18:24,661 --> 00:18:27,060
I heard that even His Majesty
has known about his presence.

399
00:18:27,621 --> 00:18:31,060
I assume the Luo Family
will become an honorable family soon.

400
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,100
Shenyuan.

401
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:34,580
Hurry.

402
00:18:36,661 --> 00:18:37,421
Marquis Lu.

403
00:18:39,488 --> 00:18:40,544
Third Young Master Luo,

404
00:18:41,381 --> 00:18:43,941
even His Majesty has praised you
for your literary prowess.

405
00:18:45,184 --> 00:18:46,900
I'm deeply flattered
by His Majesty's praise.

406
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,820
I do not deserve such flattery at all.

407
00:18:50,272 --> 00:18:50,860
By the way,

408
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,300
let me introduce her to you all.

409
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,500
This is my godsister.

410
00:18:53,701 --> 00:18:55,340
(Zhao Mingzhu)
She's Young Lady Zhao,

411
00:18:55,381 --> 00:18:57,060
the precious daughter of Duke Ying.

412
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,941
Greetings, Young Lady Zhao.

413
00:18:59,008 --> 00:19:00,380
Greetings, Third Young Master Luo.

414
00:19:00,901 --> 00:19:01,941
This is our first meeting.

415
00:19:02,272 --> 00:19:03,712
I've prepared some gifts for you.

416
00:19:09,221 --> 00:19:10,260
You're too courteous.

417
00:19:13,901 --> 00:19:15,500
This looks interesting.

418
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:18,701
Marquis Lu,

419
00:19:19,141 --> 00:19:19,621
please.

420
00:19:32,701 --> 00:19:34,141
Why does the daughter of Duke Ying

421
00:19:34,141 --> 00:19:35,421
have the surname Zhao?

422
00:19:35,621 --> 00:19:36,740
Zhao Mingzhu

423
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,941
followed Old Madam Wei since young.

424
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,221
She was favored by Old Madam Wei.

425
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,260
Since the duke had no child of his own,

426
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,421
he raised her as if
she were his own daughter.

427
00:19:48,941 --> 00:19:50,221
Young Lady Zhao's handwriting

428
00:19:50,381 --> 00:19:51,901
is agile and graceful.

429
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:53,981
Her handwriting is excellent indeed.

430
00:19:55,696 --> 00:19:57,900
Top Scholar, besides
being good at writing verses,

431
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,100
I also heard that you possess
excellent calligraphy skills.

432
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:03,060
May I have the honor
of witnessing it myself?

433
00:20:05,024 --> 00:20:06,768
I apologize for
my poor performance in advance.

434
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,580
As if a gentle breeze...

435
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,221
The sharpness of the words is concealed,

436
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,941
showing subtlety and restraint.

437
00:20:40,381 --> 00:20:41,981
He did practice calligraphy
for some time.

438
00:20:42,701 --> 00:20:44,181
However, he's still inferior

439
00:20:44,661 --> 00:20:45,780
compared to my godbrother.

440
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:47,661
All right.

441
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,421
I shall give it a try as well.

442
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,421
You can't even see now.

443
00:21:07,861 --> 00:21:09,060
How could you write?

444
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:11,661
Just tell me
what my handwriting looks like.

445
00:21:11,901 --> 00:21:12,780
It's not that good.

446
00:21:12,901 --> 00:21:14,820
It's crooked and ugly.

447
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,221
Great.

448
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:18,260
Take it back, put it in a frame,

449
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:19,861
and hang it above your bed.

450
00:21:20,421 --> 00:21:21,820
Watch it every day

451
00:21:21,872 --> 00:21:23,344
so that you can see me in your dreams.

452
00:21:23,344 --> 00:21:24,500
If so, I guess I'll be

453
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,208
having nightmares
instead of sweet dreams.

454
00:21:26,221 --> 00:21:27,060
Come on, then.

455
00:21:27,701 --> 00:21:29,020
Mei, show me

456
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:30,580
your handwriting.

457
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,381
Fine.

458
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,221
You can't see my handwriting anyway.

459
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:37,008
His stroke doesn't even
cause a ripple in the water.

460
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,981
Godbrother's handwriting
is thick and strong.

461
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,260
He's superior indeed.

462
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,300
Marquis Lu,

463
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,141
your calligraphy skills are domineering.

464
00:21:47,141 --> 00:21:48,661
No ordinary man can achieve that.

465
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,580
Registrar Luo, you flatter me.

466
00:21:50,941 --> 00:21:52,221
It radiates brilliance

467
00:21:52,448 --> 00:21:53,901
and exudes an imposing presence.

468
00:21:53,901 --> 00:21:56,381
Marquis Lu, your handwriting
resembles your conduct.

469
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:01,941
Seventh Lady.

470
00:22:03,936 --> 00:22:05,340
You haven't shown us your skills yet.

471
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:08,421
Since Third Young Master Luo
excels at calligraphy,

472
00:22:09,381 --> 00:22:10,901
I assume you're just

473
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:11,941
as good as him.

474
00:22:13,424 --> 00:22:14,832
Why don't you give it a try?

475
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,780
Seventh Lady's handwriting

476
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:11,221
actually resembles
Third Young Master Luo's handwriting.

477
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,820
Could it be that they practiced
on the same book?

478
00:23:28,901 --> 00:23:31,181
I never expected
all those calligraphy practices

479
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,941
to actually pay off today.

480
00:23:34,381 --> 00:23:35,181
Xue Zhi,

481
00:23:35,421 --> 00:23:36,580
get me some

482
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:37,580
frozen yogurt.

483
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,221
I didn't eat much the entire day.

484
00:23:40,981 --> 00:23:41,820
Yes, Young Lady.

485
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:03,500
Seventh Lady.

486
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,421
Greetings, Marquis Lu.

487
00:24:11,981 --> 00:24:13,701
I heard that you enjoyed paper cutting.

488
00:24:14,381 --> 00:24:16,580
I've brought you
some top-quality materials.

489
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:19,861
I hope

490
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:21,340
you like them.

491
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,020
I taught Mei

492
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,141
how to cut papers.

493
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,621
Your Lordship,

494
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,381
do you have questions for me?

495
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,181
You said you two were
as close as siblings.

496
00:24:48,901 --> 00:24:50,901
If so, you should know where she lives

497
00:24:51,024 --> 00:24:52,656
and whether or not she has a family.

498
00:24:58,421 --> 00:25:01,181
I did hear that she had a grandma.

499
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,701
I don't know about the rest.

500
00:25:06,368 --> 00:25:07,700
You two are as close as siblings,

501
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,280
yet you don't know her background, huh?

502
00:25:11,861 --> 00:25:14,300
Some people have known
each other their entire lives

503
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,820
without knowing
each other's true nature

504
00:25:17,221 --> 00:25:18,221
while some

505
00:25:18,496 --> 00:25:20,100
can entrust their lives to each other

506
00:25:20,256 --> 00:25:22,256
even though they didn't know
each other for long.

507
00:25:23,328 --> 00:25:24,660
One's background doesn't matter

508
00:25:25,181 --> 00:25:27,060
if they're truly bosom friends.

509
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:41,381
Let me take a look.

510
00:25:43,221 --> 00:25:43,861
Marquis Lu.

511
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,820
Marquis Lu, please mind your conduct.

512
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,181
Although I couldn't see back then,

513
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,941
I knew what Mei's hands felt like.

514
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,300
Marquis Lu.

515
00:25:58,901 --> 00:25:59,701
Third Brother.

516
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:01,381
Here's your frozen yogurt.

517
00:26:03,421 --> 00:26:05,981
Marquis, why aren't you
enjoying the feast in the courtyard?

518
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:08,100
Seventh Lady's handicraft

519
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,901
does make one reluctant to leave.

520
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:13,901
She loves to tinker
with them from time to time.

521
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:15,380
I suppose
they're of no concern to you.

522
00:26:15,981 --> 00:26:18,260
Your Lordship, you should
have a seat in the hall.

523
00:26:18,861 --> 00:26:19,701
No need for that.

524
00:26:20,381 --> 00:26:23,060
Third Young Master Luo,
if you intend to keep me company,

525
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,500
why don't we play a game of chess?

526
00:26:26,181 --> 00:26:27,701
Chess isn't my forte.

527
00:26:28,381 --> 00:26:29,901
I'm afraid
I'll spoil your mood instead.

528
00:26:31,901 --> 00:26:33,181
I'm sure you excel at chess

529
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,376
considering how devious you are.

530
00:26:37,984 --> 00:26:39,980
Your Lordship,
since you've invited me to join you,

531
00:26:39,981 --> 00:26:40,981
I shall gladly oblige.

532
00:27:04,941 --> 00:27:06,221
You and I are evenly matched.

533
00:27:06,701 --> 00:27:08,701
You actually said
chess wasn't your forte, huh?

534
00:27:08,944 --> 00:27:11,104
Third Young Master Luo,
you're being too modest here.

535
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:15,701
Unexpected moves
and full of surprises...

536
00:27:16,566 --> 00:27:19,005
Seems like you're trying to end me here.

537
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:24,981
Since you've already guessed it,

538
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,221
how do you plan to deal with it?

539
00:27:27,421 --> 00:27:29,221
I don't have any solutions to that.

540
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:30,740
I'm merely

541
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,381
waiting for fate to take its course.

542
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:37,181
Before Young Lady Zhao
came to the Luo's Residence,

543
00:27:37,381 --> 00:27:39,100
Duke Ying has instructed me

544
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:41,381
to look after her.

545
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,981
Your Lordship, you and Duke Ying

546
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,580
share a deep friendship.

547
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:51,800
The friendship between you two
transcends ages.

548
00:27:51,808 --> 00:27:52,928
It's a beautiful tale indeed.

549
00:27:52,941 --> 00:27:55,260
My family and Duke Ying's family
have been great friends

550
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:57,580
since our grandpa's generation.

551
00:27:58,181 --> 00:28:00,260
Duke Ying is righteous
and straightforward.

552
00:28:00,901 --> 00:28:02,621
Due to that,
people can exploit him easily.

553
00:28:06,221 --> 00:28:08,221
Your Lordship, you must be joking.

554
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,181
Who dares to exploit
the mighty Duke Ying?

555
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,648
The unsolved case
cannot be overturned easily.

556
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:16,320
However, if one doesn't heed my advice
and insists on intervening,

557
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:20,421
it'll only hasten
Chen Daoyan's execution.

558
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,740
Your Lordship, were you referring

559
00:28:23,941 --> 00:28:25,820
to the reopening of the unsolved case

560
00:28:25,901 --> 00:28:28,381
where Chen Jiuheng embezzled the funds
meant for disaster relief?

561
00:28:28,381 --> 00:28:30,020
It's an unsolved case.

562
00:28:30,096 --> 00:28:32,656
And, it involves a fugitive
who has been on the run for many years.

563
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:35,941
Even so, the trial
was delayed for three years.

564
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,384
But now, someone
is trying to overturn the case.

565
00:28:39,181 --> 00:28:40,580
Don't you think it's ridiculous?

566
00:28:52,381 --> 00:28:53,381
It's ridiculous indeed.

567
00:28:59,664 --> 00:29:01,504
Third Young Master Luo,
what do you think?

568
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,780
Do you think Chen Jiuheng

569
00:29:05,141 --> 00:29:06,221
will suffer a wrongful death?

570
00:29:06,512 --> 00:29:08,100
Or is he just receiving his retribution?

571
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,381
I'm just an ordinary scholar.

572
00:29:12,421 --> 00:29:14,580
I dare not make remarks
about court affairs.

573
00:29:15,861 --> 00:29:17,060
There are no outsiders here.

574
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,580
You may speak your mind.

575
00:29:24,621 --> 00:29:26,861
Since His Majesty has issued
the decree for a retrial,

576
00:29:27,421 --> 00:29:28,820
naturally, the verdict will be fair.

577
00:29:31,621 --> 00:29:32,941
A retrial is great.

578
00:29:34,381 --> 00:29:35,221
Soon,

579
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:38,181
the criminal will be transferred
to Imperial Court of Judicial.

580
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,221
I just don't know

581
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:43,740
whether or not he can still speak
when Duke Ying has him.

582
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:03,020
The game is set.

583
00:30:03,421 --> 00:30:04,740
Third Young Master Luo,

584
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,181
no matter what you do,

585
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:07,941
it's futile.

586
00:30:23,568 --> 00:30:24,660
By the way, Seventh Lady,

587
00:30:25,381 --> 00:30:27,221
I hurt your hand by accident just now.

588
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:28,740
I'm truly sorry about that.

589
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:29,941
I shall see you again.

590
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,221
Your Lordship, please.

591
00:30:46,421 --> 00:30:47,661
Your Lordship, take care.

592
00:30:48,901 --> 00:30:50,861
What should I do? My kite is...

593
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,701
What should I do?

594
00:31:05,381 --> 00:31:07,181
Can you please retrieve my kite for me?

595
00:31:07,381 --> 00:31:09,381
I spent a long time making it.

596
00:31:10,901 --> 00:31:12,221
It's stuck.

597
00:31:12,381 --> 00:31:13,740
Can you retrieve it for me?

598
00:31:16,381 --> 00:31:18,580
I'll retrieve it myself
if you ignore me.

599
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:28,840
Thank you, mister.

600
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:36,450
(Luo's Residence)

601
00:31:45,981 --> 00:31:47,421
What's wrong with Young Lady now?

602
00:31:52,976 --> 00:31:54,256
You two may leave first.

603
00:31:57,408 --> 00:31:59,584
Third Brother,
although this is my chamber,

604
00:31:59,664 --> 00:32:01,840
you're making it seem as if
it's your chamber now, huh?

605
00:32:11,941 --> 00:32:13,260
Did something happen

606
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:15,580
between you and Lu Jiaxue?

607
00:32:16,901 --> 00:32:18,901
It's all in the past.

608
00:32:18,976 --> 00:32:20,336
There's nothing worth mentioning.

609
00:32:26,768 --> 00:32:28,220
Did you
make acquaintance with him

610
00:32:28,221 --> 00:32:29,740
when you were in the courtyard?

611
00:32:29,861 --> 00:32:31,740
He was imprisoned
by his brother before this.

612
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,381
He had no vision for some time.

613
00:32:33,421 --> 00:32:35,060
That's why he can't recognize you yet,

614
00:32:35,141 --> 00:32:35,941
am I right?

615
00:32:36,141 --> 00:32:37,340
Third Brother, you should stop.

616
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,100
Stay away from him.

617
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,381
I'm worried about your safety.

618
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:51,500
You too.

619
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,459
There's a new snack shop
at the night market lately.

620
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,664
Their snacks are truly delicious.

621
00:33:03,664 --> 00:33:04,832
- Let's go.
- Stop right there.

622
00:33:07,901 --> 00:33:08,861
Madam Chen.

623
00:33:09,381 --> 00:33:10,181
Mother.

624
00:33:10,861 --> 00:33:12,540
Where are you two going
at this late hour?

625
00:33:18,381 --> 00:33:19,221
Young Master Lin,

626
00:33:19,381 --> 00:33:21,500
right now you're being polite.

627
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:22,540
But you're taking

628
00:33:22,540 --> 00:33:24,740
an unmarried lady out
at such a late time.

629
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:25,901
That won't do.

630
00:33:25,901 --> 00:33:27,580
Mother, this isn't Sixth Uncle's fault.

631
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:28,901
I told him to take me out.

632
00:33:28,901 --> 00:33:29,861
Shut up.

633
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,728
Judging from the way you act,

634
00:33:31,901 --> 00:33:34,100
I assume this isn't the first time
you're doing this.

635
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,621
You're a lady.

636
00:33:35,701 --> 00:33:37,621
How could you go out
with a man like this?

637
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,740
Aren't you afraid
that your reputation will be ruined?

638
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,381
But he's my sixth uncle.

639
00:33:42,621 --> 00:33:43,861
Even so, he's an outsider.

640
00:33:43,941 --> 00:33:46,421
I suppose you never paid any attention

641
00:33:46,421 --> 00:33:48,141
to the etiquette and rules
I taught you, huh?

642
00:33:48,861 --> 00:33:49,820
Madam Chen,

643
00:33:50,221 --> 00:33:51,221
I admit

644
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,661
that I was inconsiderate today.

645
00:33:56,141 --> 00:33:57,419
Her Highness said
that you

646
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:59,168
could ignore the rules
because she liked you.

647
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:00,432
But this is the imperial family.

648
00:34:00,448 --> 00:34:02,128
How could we disregard
the rules for real?

649
00:34:02,208 --> 00:34:03,700
You have to act like a noble lady

650
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,941
when you marry into
the Han Family in the future.

651
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,221
The Luo Family

652
00:34:07,381 --> 00:34:09,100
is a family of scholars.

653
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:11,620
We're superior to those petty merchants.

654
00:34:11,904 --> 00:34:14,340
Mother, I didn't say I was
going to marry into the Han Family.

655
00:34:14,341 --> 00:34:15,261
Nonsense!

656
00:34:15,981 --> 00:34:16,899
Mr. Han

657
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,368
is Her Highness's only son.

658
00:34:18,432 --> 00:34:20,490
Many families wish
to form a marital alliance with them.

659
00:34:20,528 --> 00:34:21,980
But they don't have the chance to do so.

660
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:23,380
Which family do you want to marry into

661
00:34:23,381 --> 00:34:24,381
if not the Han Family?

662
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:27,140
Don't tell me you want
to get married to a street vendor

663
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:28,140
or the son of a merchant?

664
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:33,781
Yixiu,

665
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,648
you should head back first.

666
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,381
I'll head there alone later.

667
00:34:38,981 --> 00:34:40,500
Sixth Lady, let's go.

668
00:34:48,341 --> 00:34:49,301
Young Master Lin,

669
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:53,020
you're considered Yixiu's elder.

670
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:54,901
If you truly want the best for her,

671
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,500
please stay away from her in the future.

672
00:34:57,696 --> 00:34:59,100
Don't let people misunderstand her.

673
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,500
It'll ruin her future.

674
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:13,180
Sixth Lady, you should be obedient.

675
00:35:15,981 --> 00:35:19,220
Today, you should
embroider a lotus handkerchief.

676
00:35:19,421 --> 00:35:21,700
I'll instruct my men
to deliver it to Her Highness tomorrow.

677
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,830
Her Highness doesn't like such things.

678
00:35:24,928 --> 00:35:26,688
If so, you should make a pearl hairpin.

679
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:28,381
If not,

680
00:35:28,421 --> 00:35:30,421
you should prepare some snacks
for Mr. Han.

681
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,700
Anyway, from today onward,

682
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:33,980
you better stop saying dumb things

683
00:35:33,981 --> 00:35:35,500
like you don't want to get married.

684
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:36,861
Mother,

685
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:39,781
you're trying to kill me here.

686
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,341
You!

687
00:35:42,341 --> 00:35:42,941
Mother.

688
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:45,220
Yiyu.

689
00:35:45,341 --> 00:35:46,781
What's wrong again?

690
00:35:46,901 --> 00:35:49,060
You should persuade your sister
when you have the time.

691
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:50,861
Her Highness wants her son to marry her.

692
00:35:50,861 --> 00:35:52,060
But she rejected it!

693
00:35:52,301 --> 00:35:53,821
I don't like Han Zhao.

694
00:35:53,821 --> 00:35:56,020
I don't care if he's
Her Highness's eldest son.

695
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:56,784
I won't marry to him.

696
00:35:56,901 --> 00:35:58,741
How could you only think about yourself?

697
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:00,020
Do you know

698
00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:01,540
that you'll bring great benefits

699
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,660
to your father and brothers

700
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,821
if you get married
to Her Highness's son?

701
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:06,901
Do you expect me to sacrifice my future

702
00:36:06,901 --> 00:36:09,341
just so I could help
Father and my brothers out?

703
00:36:09,341 --> 00:36:10,381
Mother, I'm a person.

704
00:36:10,381 --> 00:36:12,220
I'm not a commodity to be traded!

705
00:36:12,381 --> 00:36:14,301
Say that again if you dare!

706
00:36:14,781 --> 00:36:15,580
Yixiu is still young.

707
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:16,901
She doesn't know how to speak well.

708
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:18,140
Please don't be angry.

709
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,620
I won't get married to Han Zhao!

710
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:21,360
Who else do you think
you can get married to?

711
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,100
Lin Mao?

712
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:24,741
He's just a street vendor!

713
00:36:24,784 --> 00:36:25,984
He's the son of a petty merchant!

714
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:27,500
He's not good enough for you!

715
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:28,580
Listen up!

716
00:36:28,741 --> 00:36:30,341
You want to marry into the Lin Family?

717
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,901
Over my dead body!

718
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,220
Keep an eye on her.

719
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:34,544
Do not allow her to leave the yard.

720
00:36:34,912 --> 00:36:35,984
- Yes, Madam.
- Let's go.

721
00:36:50,901 --> 00:36:52,861
Madam, you don't need to be too worried.

722
00:36:54,301 --> 00:36:56,140
It's still likely that Mr. Han

723
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:58,341
will marry her.

724
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:01,620
Sixth Lady is just being silly
for the time being.

725
00:37:01,821 --> 00:37:03,781
But Mr. Han has fallen head over heels

726
00:37:03,861 --> 00:37:05,700
for her.

727
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:06,941
Moreover,

728
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:09,381
Madam Shen has a good impression

729
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,261
of First Lady as well.

730
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,261
I can choose to be patient.

731
00:37:13,901 --> 00:37:15,741
However, I have to make preparations

732
00:37:15,808 --> 00:37:17,664
to deal with those two
from the second wife's side.

733
00:37:17,712 --> 00:37:19,900
If Luo Shenyuan passes
the academy exam again,

734
00:37:19,901 --> 00:37:21,580
we'll be in huge trouble.

735
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,140
Madam, you're right.

736
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,020
I'll definitely instruct our men

737
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,901
to keep a close eye on Sixth Lady.

738
00:37:28,224 --> 00:37:30,580
Have you received any news
from the men we sent to the estate?

739
00:37:30,861 --> 00:37:32,020
Not yet.

740
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,781
Madam, if you're still worried,

741
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:36,020
why don't we

742
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,981
get rid of them directly?

743
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:39,941
If not,

744
00:37:39,941 --> 00:37:42,220
we might be in trouble
if Mistress Qiao reveals

745
00:37:42,381 --> 00:37:44,060
something she's not supposed to.

746
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,660
Be patient.

747
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:47,941
The time isn't ripe yet.

748
00:37:50,013 --> 00:37:51,380
(Liuhe Tavern)

749
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,958
(Map of the Capital's Inner City)

750
00:37:56,301 --> 00:37:58,580
Duke Ying is presiding over this case.

751
00:38:00,064 --> 00:38:04,901
It's inconvenient to make a move at Dengwen
Drum Court and Imperial Court of Judicial.

752
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:07,060
However, no one can say for sure

753
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,741
during the escort process.

754
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:11,220
It's the duty of the Imperial Guards
to escort criminals.

755
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,981
If something happens
during the escort mission,

756
00:38:12,981 --> 00:38:14,620
Lu Jiaxue will be
held accountable for it.

757
00:38:14,861 --> 00:38:16,341
Lu Jiaxue brought Zhao Mingzhu

758
00:38:16,341 --> 00:38:17,381
to the Top Scholar Feast

759
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:18,660
in order to make me give up

760
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,608
on the hope that Duke Ying
can preside over the case.

761
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:22,540
He even leaked the news
to me on purpose.

762
00:38:23,421 --> 00:38:25,580
He wants us to stake everything
to rescue Senior Daoyan.

763
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,460
On the surface, it seemed
like a prison break-out attempt

764
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:30,220
where the inmate unfortunately
met his demise.

765
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:30,880
In secret,

766
00:38:31,421 --> 00:38:33,060
he can capture
all of us in one fell swoop.

767
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,060
He's truly devious.

768
00:38:37,341 --> 00:38:39,220
Duke Ying is presiding over
the case, right?

769
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,941
I assume he won't just sit idly by

770
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:45,220
if he hears about
Lu Jiaxue's plan somehow.

771
00:38:46,261 --> 00:38:48,741
Duke Ying can deal with
Lu Jiaxue on the surface.

772
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,220
However, we're the only ones
who can deal with

773
00:38:51,901 --> 00:38:54,020
the threats that are
lurking beneath the surface.

774
00:38:54,301 --> 00:38:56,381
If so, our current priority is to escort

775
00:38:56,381 --> 00:38:58,580
Senior Daoyan
to Imperial Court of Judicial safely.

776
00:38:59,861 --> 00:39:00,781
But that Lu Jiaxue

777
00:39:00,781 --> 00:39:02,259
will feign
a prison break with his men

778
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,710
in order to assassinate Senior Daoyan.

779
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:05,741
Even if there was only a sliver of hope,

780
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,272
Senior Daoyan was still
willing to risk his life to do so.

781
00:39:08,901 --> 00:39:11,341
We have to keep
Senior Daoyan safe no matter what.

782
00:39:11,472 --> 00:39:12,060
That's right.

783
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,901
This is a risky operation.

784
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:16,741
Guys, we have to be cautious.

785
00:39:16,821 --> 00:39:18,140
Shenyuan, if so,

786
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:19,140
what should we do?

787
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,568
This is the escort route

788
00:39:21,584 --> 00:39:24,010
they use from Dengwen Drum Court
to Imperial Court of Judicial...

789
00:39:41,341 --> 00:39:42,140
Young Master,

790
00:39:42,208 --> 00:39:43,984
all of your instructions
have been carried out.

791
00:39:45,301 --> 00:39:45,781
Come here.

792
00:39:48,941 --> 00:39:50,580
There are money, title deeds,

793
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:51,500
and land deeds in here.

794
00:39:52,032 --> 00:39:54,000
These are meant as
dowries for Seventh Lady.

795
00:39:54,741 --> 00:39:55,939
Aren't these for Seventh Lady?

796
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,248
Why are you telling me about them?

797
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:59,660
This is the token of credit
of Longquan Trading House.

798
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,660
If something goes wrong,

799
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,120
(Longquan)
hand all of these to Seventh Lady.

800
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,901
If she takes this token to Liuhe Tavern,

801
00:40:04,901 --> 00:40:05,899
she'll receive help

802
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,168
regardless of the circumstances.

803
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:07,700
Young Master,

804
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:09,341
what are you saying?

805
00:40:09,392 --> 00:40:11,616
It's as if you're making arrangements
for your last affairs.

806
00:40:12,421 --> 00:40:13,341
And this letter.

807
00:40:13,808 --> 00:40:15,152
It's for Seventh Lady as well.

808
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:17,712
Keep it on her behalf.

809
00:40:17,728 --> 00:40:19,080
(To Yining. From Shenyuan.)

810
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:26,060
This operation carries a certain risk.

811
00:40:26,741 --> 00:40:28,500
I'll try my best to stay in one piece.

812
00:40:28,816 --> 00:40:30,020
I'm doing this just in case.

813
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,180
Don't say that.

814
00:40:31,421 --> 00:40:33,660
With your skills,
I'm sure you'll come back alive.

815
00:40:34,781 --> 00:40:35,580
All right now.

816
00:40:35,696 --> 00:40:37,168
I have other affairs to attend to.

817
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:43,762
(Yanrong Pavilion)

818
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:48,000
Yanrong Pavilion?

819
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,981
I like that name.

820
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:52,261
I came up with plenty of names
before this.

821
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,540
But I think it sounds better

822
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:54,880
if we use a straightforward name.

823
00:40:54,928 --> 00:40:55,900
I'm glad that you like it.

824
00:40:55,936 --> 00:40:57,792
Having received the handwriting
of the future top scholar,

825
00:40:57,808 --> 00:40:59,300
our business will boom
in the future.

826
00:40:59,421 --> 00:41:01,821
Third Brother, I wanted you
to write something for me initially.

827
00:41:01,821 --> 00:41:03,741
Seems like I didn't even
need to ask for it.

828
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,180
It's just that I didn't have the time

829
00:41:07,261 --> 00:41:08,781
to clean the shop up.

830
00:41:08,941 --> 00:41:10,060
Go in and take a look.

831
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,320
(Clouds her dress, flowers her beauty.
Spring breeze brushes, dew shines bright.)

832
00:41:17,901 --> 00:41:19,781
How is it already decorated?

833
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:23,776
What do you think?

834
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:25,741
Is it the same as
what you imagine to be?

835
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:27,741
It's much better than what I imagined.

836
00:41:28,341 --> 00:41:29,421
I remember

837
00:41:29,421 --> 00:41:30,941
that there was a rack here.

838
00:41:31,088 --> 00:41:32,260
I told my men to move it away.

839
00:41:32,660 --> 00:41:34,941
Your products don't take up much space.

840
00:41:35,341 --> 00:41:37,020
The atmosphere and style of the shop

841
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:37,981
are very important.

842
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:39,421
All these things

843
00:41:39,741 --> 00:41:41,580
can increase the value of your products.

844
00:41:41,580 --> 00:41:42,861
When you put them on display,

845
00:41:42,976 --> 00:41:44,400
they'll work as decorations as well.

846
00:41:44,944 --> 00:41:46,688
Third Brother,
you're experienced indeed.

847
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,540
I'll show you around the backyard.

848
00:41:54,861 --> 00:41:56,540
The backyard is gorgeous.

849
00:41:57,261 --> 00:41:58,540
There's a swing here.

850
00:41:58,544 --> 00:41:59,856
There are ginkgo trees as well.

851
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:01,901
By then, I'll enjoy the swing ride

852
00:42:01,901 --> 00:42:03,060
as you read to me.

853
00:42:03,381 --> 00:42:04,540
That sounds delightful.

854
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:08,140
Although the place isn't huge,

855
00:42:08,301 --> 00:42:09,781
it's perfect for accommodation.

856
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:11,741
There are four rooms

857
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,248
besides the main hall and the kitchen.

858
00:42:13,901 --> 00:42:15,261
By then, when you're tired

859
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:17,060
of operating the shop,

860
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:18,981
you can rest here.

861
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:20,421
This room

862
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:21,901
should be the largest room.

863
00:42:22,112 --> 00:42:24,112
Third Brother,
I'll reserve this room for you.

864
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:26,780
You can read and rest inside.

865
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:29,341
I don't need such a huge room
for my studies.

866
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:31,140
You can reserve it for yourself.

867
00:42:31,232 --> 00:42:33,220
You enjoy playing the pipa
and cutting paper, right?

868
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:34,384
I've prepared everything.

869
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,740
Practice your handwriting.

870
00:42:35,901 --> 00:42:37,220
You have to practice it

871
00:42:37,264 --> 00:42:38,384
even when I'm not around.

872
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:40,580
Third Brother,
why wouldn't you be around?

873
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:41,861
I mean,

874
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:43,741
you're not allowed

875
00:42:43,821 --> 00:42:46,580
to skive when I'm not here
to monitor you.

876
00:42:47,861 --> 00:42:49,500
Third Brother, you're acting strange.

877
00:42:49,568 --> 00:42:51,620
Why did you prepare all these things
for me suddenly?

878
00:42:53,381 --> 00:42:54,700
It's not a sudden thought.

879
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:56,220
I remember

880
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:57,660
everything you said when you said

881
00:42:57,968 --> 00:42:59,680
you wanted to leave the Luo's Residence.

882
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:04,140
All of these

883
00:43:04,781 --> 00:43:06,580
will serve as
your dowries in the future.

884
00:43:07,941 --> 00:43:08,741
All right now.

885
00:43:08,941 --> 00:43:10,741
I need to head to Mr. Sun's academy now.

886
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:11,981
I'll leave now.
