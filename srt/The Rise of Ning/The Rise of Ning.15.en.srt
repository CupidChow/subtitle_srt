00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,400
=The Rise of Ning=

2
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,320
(Adapted from Wen Tan's novel "Chancellor
Training Handbook" from Jinjiang Literature)

3
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,814
=Episode 15=

4
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:45,767
Madam Lin is paying more attention

5
00:01:45,887 --> 00:01:47,448
to household matters.

6
00:01:47,767 --> 00:01:49,468
One moment she's at Yining's,

7
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,361
the next she's back here.

8
00:01:51,554 --> 00:01:53,435
You call that being attentive?

9
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,320
Someone must have made her do it.

10
00:01:58,955 --> 00:02:00,515
Did you hear her talking just now?

11
00:02:00,516 --> 00:02:01,837
It was one idea after another.

12
00:02:02,235 --> 00:02:04,435
As if she had the capability.

13
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:06,875
Now Seventh Lady's attention is fixated

14
00:02:06,955 --> 00:02:08,194
on that person from Jimo House.

15
00:02:08,634 --> 00:02:10,829
She even came to plead with you

16
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,400
about adding him to the family registry.

17
00:02:14,065 --> 00:02:16,264
Yining is a good child.

18
00:02:16,435 --> 00:02:18,035
As long as her heart is set,

19
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,479
she'll do her utmost to help him.

20
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:26,634
As for the Literary Feast,

21
00:02:27,674 --> 00:02:29,754
she and that boy from Jimo House

22
00:02:29,954 --> 00:02:32,035
seem to have the same idea.

23
00:02:32,155 --> 00:02:34,074
If you're willing to help me

24
00:02:34,435 --> 00:02:35,914
put on the Literary Feast again,

25
00:02:36,674 --> 00:02:38,074
I vow not to let you down

26
00:02:38,234 --> 00:02:39,715
and revitalize Luo's Residence glory.

27
00:02:39,835 --> 00:02:41,595
Then there will be no need to worry

28
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:43,726
about my father.

29
00:02:44,835 --> 00:02:46,794
That boy from Jimo House...

30
00:02:46,914 --> 00:02:49,435
The way he's so sure of himself,

31
00:02:49,835 --> 00:02:53,035
it's just like how Old Master was.

32
00:02:53,275 --> 00:02:56,794
I'm just not quite sure
if he can walk the talk.

33
00:02:59,995 --> 00:03:00,835
Here's the plan.

34
00:03:01,275 --> 00:03:02,794
Make arrangements.

35
00:03:03,115 --> 00:03:06,595
I will make a visit
to Sun's Residence tomorrow.

36
00:03:08,435 --> 00:03:09,234
Will do.

37
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,840
Your Lordship.

38
00:03:22,872 --> 00:03:25,552
Anything out of the norm
at Luo's Residence?

39
00:03:25,584 --> 00:03:27,840
There weren't any suspicious persons
entering or leaving.

40
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,165
What about Luo Shenyuan?

41
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:31,204
Recently,

42
00:03:31,472 --> 00:03:33,008
he's been frequenting the bookstore.

43
00:03:33,024 --> 00:03:35,600
We've been following him the whole time.
Nothing out of the ordinary.

44
00:03:37,644 --> 00:03:39,084
The bookstore?

45
00:03:40,285 --> 00:03:41,565
What did he do there?

46
00:03:41,644 --> 00:03:42,324
We checked.

47
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,484
He went there to buy books and stuff.

48
00:03:44,608 --> 00:03:46,279
Seems like he's looking
for last-minute help

49
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,420
for the impending examination.

50
00:04:05,644 --> 00:04:08,804
The way of the literary mind
is centered around nature,

51
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:10,484
expressed with emotions,

52
00:04:11,044 --> 00:04:13,405
and put down in words
with pen and paper.

53
00:04:13,644 --> 00:04:15,804
How wonderful...

54
00:04:20,725 --> 00:04:21,444
Sir.

55
00:04:22,285 --> 00:04:23,165
Are you alright?

56
00:04:24,684 --> 00:04:25,564
Careful, sir.

57
00:04:26,444 --> 00:04:28,124
I'm so sorry, sir.

58
00:04:28,126 --> 00:04:30,165
- Are you hurt?
- I'm alright.

59
00:04:31,835 --> 00:04:34,405
I hope the books didn't fall on you.

60
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,520
There's an old saying
that books are akin to medicine.

61
00:04:36,589 --> 00:04:38,149
Reading can cure stupidity.

62
00:04:38,176 --> 00:04:39,792
So it's fine getting knocked by books.

63
00:04:40,928 --> 00:04:42,016
(Selected Works on Bitter Effort)

64
00:04:42,016 --> 00:04:43,205
You seem awfully young

65
00:04:43,205 --> 00:04:45,165
to be reading
Selected Works on Bitter Effort.

66
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,720
Reading is for all ages.

67
00:04:48,784 --> 00:04:49,930
It's down to one's preference.

68
00:04:50,364 --> 00:04:53,444
But that book has been in obscurity
since the Western Han Dynasty.

69
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,800
Not many people know about it nowadays.

70
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,041
A hidden treasure is

71
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:58,720
awaiting the right person
to discover it.

72
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:01,244
The stories in this book

73
00:05:01,262 --> 00:05:03,462
are vigorous and fresh,
inspired by nature.

74
00:05:03,628 --> 00:05:05,589
Compared to the exuberant works
of today,

75
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,880
I think they're of higher quality.

76
00:05:07,285 --> 00:05:08,165
Since you're fine,

77
00:05:08,364 --> 00:05:10,604
I shall take my leave first.

78
00:05:15,604 --> 00:05:17,525
I guess young people nowadays

79
00:05:17,684 --> 00:05:20,165
aren't all worldly-minded.

80
00:05:25,924 --> 00:05:28,261
I'm sure this medicine would work.
Yixiu, let's hurry and...

81
00:05:30,085 --> 00:05:30,725
Yixiu?

82
00:05:34,564 --> 00:05:35,364
Excuse me.

83
00:05:38,285 --> 00:05:40,439
Yixiu, I thought
we were taking a breather.

84
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,232
Why eat again?

85
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,919
I'm not on a diet.
Why can't I eat what I want?

86
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,940
Do you want to be reprimanded
by your mother again?

87
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,181
Boss, we don't want it.

88
00:05:50,061 --> 00:05:50,820
Young master.

89
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,221
Once taken, it's sold.

90
00:05:52,237 --> 00:05:53,117
Once taken, it's sold.

91
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:54,348
I already paid for it.

92
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,700
You can keep the money, okay?

93
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:56,960
Fine, then.

94
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,741
Let's go. We should go home.

95
00:05:59,621 --> 00:06:00,981
I'm not telling you to stop eating.

96
00:06:01,101 --> 00:06:02,732
But you've already had roasted lamb,

97
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,191
pancakes, and persimmons.

98
00:06:04,421 --> 00:06:05,781
Any more and you'll get indigestion.

99
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,981
Then I'll have to get medicine
for your stomachache.

100
00:06:08,661 --> 00:06:10,700
Bring me out again next time, then.

101
00:06:11,033 --> 00:06:11,834
Sure thing.

102
00:06:16,761 --> 00:06:18,722
Miss! Miss!

103
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:19,820
Me?

104
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,621
Yes, you. Come over here.

105
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:22,820
What is it?

106
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:23,340
Here.

107
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:24,741
A treat for you.

108
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:26,380
It's free. Take it.

109
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:29,061
- But...
- Miss, come here.

110
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,221
Take this.

111
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,840
Try this. It's delicious.

112
00:06:32,304 --> 00:06:34,064
- Have a bite.
- Who asked you guys to come?

113
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:34,900
No one.

114
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:35,981
You...

115
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:12,020
Why are you eating food
of unknown origin? Let's go.

116
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,559
What are you doing
sneaking around in my room?

117
00:07:35,152 --> 00:07:36,900
Of all the instances
you could've come back,

118
00:07:37,022 --> 00:07:38,421
you had to show up now and catch me.

119
00:07:38,661 --> 00:07:40,500
What...

120
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,661
What are you mumbling about?

121
00:07:42,259 --> 00:07:42,978
Nothing.

122
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:45,260
You sprained your foot

123
00:07:45,269 --> 00:07:46,749
in the field not long ago, right?

124
00:07:47,072 --> 00:07:48,180
I got some medicine for you.

125
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,020
It's effective.

126
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:50,301
Where is it?

127
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:51,981
I put it in the room.

128
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:01,500
Now, listen.

129
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,541
If you could put half the effort into...

130
00:08:03,574 --> 00:08:04,813
Okay, I know I was wrong.

131
00:08:06,905 --> 00:08:08,585
I shouldn't have talked back.

132
00:08:08,861 --> 00:08:10,661
Don't be mad.
It's affecting your health.

133
00:08:11,181 --> 00:08:12,488
You think I enjoy

134
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,181
nagging and arguing with you
all the time?

135
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:15,741
Blame my stupid mouth.

136
00:08:16,061 --> 00:08:16,861
It's my fault.

137
00:08:19,816 --> 00:08:21,016
Don't worry.

138
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,120
I will prepare well
for the imperial exam.

139
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:26,240
Do you mean it?

140
00:08:26,421 --> 00:08:28,101
Yes, I will do my best.

141
00:08:29,101 --> 00:08:29,621
See?

142
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,100
How good it is
that you've come to your senses.

143
00:08:32,112 --> 00:08:33,568
Our parents have high hopes for you.

144
00:08:34,061 --> 00:08:34,580
Hairu.

145
00:08:35,141 --> 00:08:36,340
I just got back.

146
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,700
I'm so hungry.

147
00:08:38,661 --> 00:08:40,940
The kitchen saved
your favorite fish soup.

148
00:08:41,061 --> 00:08:41,860
Go and drink it.

149
00:08:42,061 --> 00:08:43,541
Once you're done, go and study.

150
00:08:54,637 --> 00:08:57,207
(Luo's Residence)

151
00:09:04,501 --> 00:09:06,061
Organizing the Literary Feast again

152
00:09:06,381 --> 00:09:08,261
is a big occasion for the Luo Family.

153
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,381
Thankfully,

154
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:12,740
Mr. Sun is keen to get to know
the young talents.

155
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,620
He was graceful enough

156
00:09:14,872 --> 00:09:16,633
to agree to come.

157
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,421
Mother.

158
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,860
It's been many years
since Luo's Residence

159
00:09:19,885 --> 00:09:21,806
organized such a grand event.

160
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,541
Back then,

161
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:25,301
when Father was still alive,

162
00:09:25,661 --> 00:09:26,661
Luo's Residence

163
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,980
had been so highly respected.

164
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,912
To be able to put on the feast this time

165
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,260
is thanks to Mother's prominence.

166
00:09:32,368 --> 00:09:34,144
She was able to persuade
the imperial tutor.

167
00:09:34,261 --> 00:09:36,580
Yes, it's thanks to Mother's efforts.

168
00:09:37,061 --> 00:09:38,141
Chengzhang,

169
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,580
get a move on inviting

170
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,381
the rest of the famous scholars.

171
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,220
You have to handle the matter.

172
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:46,940
Rest assured, Mother.

173
00:09:48,181 --> 00:09:48,820
Mother,

174
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:50,381
there's something

175
00:09:50,541 --> 00:09:51,740
I'd like to ask you.

176
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:55,820
Could we take out
Father's treasured books

177
00:09:55,901 --> 00:09:58,620
and let the guests view them?

178
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,100
It's an opportunity to showcase

179
00:10:00,144 --> 00:10:01,696
Luo's Residence's century-old heritage.

180
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,141
That's a good idea.

181
00:10:04,421 --> 00:10:05,901
Assign a crew

182
00:10:05,902 --> 00:10:07,621
to decorate Lake Jingxin.

183
00:10:08,261 --> 00:10:09,860
That place is very serene.

184
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,421
When your father was alive,

185
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,740
he liked to read there.

186
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,559
Display all his collections there

187
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,501
for everyone to view.

188
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,740
Yes, Mother.

189
00:10:21,501 --> 00:10:25,381
Well then, I'll leave
the itinerary and banquet

190
00:10:25,661 --> 00:10:27,301
to you two.

191
00:10:27,344 --> 00:10:29,100
- Rest assured, Mother.
- Rest assured, Mother.

192
00:10:29,104 --> 00:10:30,420
Don't worry about it.

193
00:10:30,736 --> 00:10:32,700
As long as Mr. Sun has agreed to attend,

194
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,340
the famous scholars in the city

195
00:10:34,453 --> 00:10:35,813
will be scrambling to come.

196
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,181
This Literary Feast

197
00:10:37,301 --> 00:10:39,220
will be as lively as can be.

198
00:10:41,181 --> 00:10:42,781
Shanyuan, Xuanyuan.

199
00:10:43,381 --> 00:10:44,700
Make sure you win the top spot

200
00:10:44,749 --> 00:10:46,310
in the event this time.

201
00:10:46,421 --> 00:10:49,141
You wouldn't want my efforts
to go to waste.

202
00:10:49,648 --> 00:10:51,360
- Will do, Grandma.
- Will do, Grandma.

203
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:56,061
This is a chance for the ladies
to show off their skills, too.

204
00:10:56,301 --> 00:10:58,141
Yu and Xiu are quite good

205
00:10:58,151 --> 00:10:59,830
on the guzheng and pipa.

206
00:11:00,061 --> 00:11:01,501
As for Lian, needless to say

207
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,901
she's proficient in all four arts.

208
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,181
Meanwhile, Yining is skilled
at painting and paper cutting.

209
00:11:06,661 --> 00:11:08,972
Who knows we'd be able to bring together

210
00:11:09,021 --> 00:11:10,820
talent with beauty this time?

211
00:11:12,912 --> 00:11:14,288
(Danhua Abode)

212
00:11:14,304 --> 00:11:15,140
Madam Chen.

213
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,820
Second Master's family
only has Xuanyuan left.

214
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,100
Madam Lin

215
00:11:19,181 --> 00:11:21,061
has always disliked Bilian Pavilion.

216
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,140
How did she convince Old Madam

217
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:24,700
to hold the Literary Feast?

218
00:11:24,781 --> 00:11:26,820
And Old Madam
actually went ahead with it.

219
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,181
I had plans to hire
a famous tutor for Shan.

220
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:35,940
The Literary Feast
is a good opportunity.

221
00:11:38,061 --> 00:11:39,740
But even if the top spot

222
00:11:40,021 --> 00:11:41,421
doesn't go to Shan,

223
00:11:42,181 --> 00:11:44,580
it must not go to the one
from Bilian Pavilion.

224
00:11:46,661 --> 00:11:49,141
There are plenty of
talented young men in the capital.

225
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,121
It's not that easy

226
00:11:51,141 --> 00:11:52,541
to win the top spot.

227
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:53,901
In my opinion,

228
00:11:54,301 --> 00:11:55,980
the young man from Bilian Pavilion

229
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,820
is limited in his stature.

230
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:59,820
It'll be hard to enter
the hall of elites.

231
00:12:00,211 --> 00:12:02,091
If only our eldest was here,

232
00:12:02,381 --> 00:12:04,541
the concubine's boy
wouldn't even stand a chance.

233
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,340
We should focus on our own matters.

234
00:12:13,021 --> 00:12:13,661
Yes, Madam.

235
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,579
(Jimo Hall)

236
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:17,381
Third Brother,

237
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,740
are you confident
for tomorrow's Literary Feast?

238
00:12:20,021 --> 00:12:22,021
I heard principal home's Luo Shanyuan

239
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:23,860
had hired several famous scholars

240
00:12:24,093 --> 00:12:25,333
to help him write the poem

241
00:12:25,334 --> 00:12:26,699
for tomorrow's event

242
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,820
so he could stand out.

243
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,360
Luo Xuanyuan

244
00:12:29,421 --> 00:12:31,381
is also burning midnight oil.

245
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,119
I have a plan for tomorrow.

246
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:37,740
But,

247
00:12:38,301 --> 00:12:40,381
there's another more important matter.

248
00:12:41,141 --> 00:12:44,700
Do you mean getting your senior
out of the mansion?

249
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,060
The mansion will be filled
with people tomorrow.

250
00:12:49,501 --> 00:12:51,381
It's the best chance
to get him out of here.

251
00:12:52,181 --> 00:12:52,700
Also,

252
00:12:53,467 --> 00:12:55,026
I need to borrow someone from you.

253
00:12:57,061 --> 00:12:57,781
Who?

254
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,141
You're finally back, Your Lordship.

255
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,180
His Majesty summoned me last minute
this morning.

256
00:13:06,501 --> 00:13:07,940
I expected it to last till afternoon.

257
00:13:08,688 --> 00:13:09,664
What's the matter?

258
00:13:09,744 --> 00:13:11,232
Is something up with Luo's Residence?

259
00:13:12,141 --> 00:13:14,490
We've kept a close eye on
Luo's Residence for the past few days.

260
00:13:14,496 --> 00:13:16,304
There's no way Chen Daoyan
could've escaped.

261
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,340
However,

262
00:13:17,664 --> 00:13:19,720
Luo's Residence is holding
the Literary Feast today.

263
00:13:19,901 --> 00:13:20,980
It will be crowded.

264
00:13:21,039 --> 00:13:21,998
I'm guessing

265
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,980
that they will use this chance

266
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,181
to get Chen Daoyan out.

267
00:13:25,261 --> 00:13:27,181
I've heard about the Literary Feast.

268
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:29,261
I've already instructed Cheng Lang

269
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,141
to join in the fun at Luo's Residence

270
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,061
and keep a close watch on Luo Shenyuan.

271
00:13:33,781 --> 00:13:34,700
How wise of you, sir.

272
00:13:35,460 --> 00:13:37,021
I've also stationed men

273
00:13:37,141 --> 00:13:38,021
around the mansion.

274
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,460
I heard that Luo's Residence

275
00:13:41,781 --> 00:13:44,860
managed to invite Sun Jie to the event.

276
00:13:45,381 --> 00:13:45,860
Yes.

277
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,661
That's the reason why

278
00:13:47,901 --> 00:13:49,580
many of the famous scholars in the city

279
00:13:49,648 --> 00:13:51,180
will be congregating
at Luo's Residence.

280
00:13:51,261 --> 00:13:53,061
He created such a big fuss

281
00:13:53,421 --> 00:13:54,781
for the sake of Chen Daoyan.

282
00:13:55,261 --> 00:13:57,100
It certainly changed my mind about him.

283
00:13:57,264 --> 00:13:58,380
(Luo Shenyuan)

284
00:13:58,381 --> 00:13:59,061
So be it.

285
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,152
Sun Jie is an esteemed imperial tutor.

286
00:14:01,181 --> 00:14:02,340
This is a rare opportunity.

287
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,061
I shall go and check it out myself.

288
00:14:06,742 --> 00:14:09,570
(Luo Shenyuan)

289
00:14:09,797 --> 00:14:13,375
(Luo's Residence)

290
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,381
Please head inside.

291
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:22,661
Registrar Luo.

292
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,620
Welcome.

293
00:14:37,021 --> 00:14:38,061
A feast without food.

294
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,680
Better for me to cook something myself.

295
00:14:45,061 --> 00:14:46,100
Miss Lamb.

296
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,501
Get over here.

297
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:52,361
Come here.

298
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,281
I don't want anyone to see me.

299
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:56,901
Miss Lamb.

300
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:58,781
Miss Gao?

301
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,000
I'm Sixth Lady of Luo's Residence.

302
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,661
- You...
- Sixth Lady...

303
00:15:03,181 --> 00:15:05,220
Are you the guy
at Liuhe Tavern the other day?

304
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,580
Guess we have some affinity.

305
00:15:12,541 --> 00:15:13,620
That's...

306
00:15:13,781 --> 00:15:14,980
It's tile-grilled meat.

307
00:15:15,024 --> 00:15:16,424
From grilling to seasoning,

308
00:15:16,605 --> 00:15:18,005
it's all me.

309
00:15:18,781 --> 00:15:19,781
It's really good.

310
00:15:20,046 --> 00:15:21,125
Would you like to try?

311
00:15:23,181 --> 00:15:24,580
- Okay.
- Here you go.

312
00:15:25,901 --> 00:15:27,580
The meat is sliced thinly

313
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:29,600
and grilled on a tile
before dipping in the sauce.

314
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:31,248
The taste is nothing short
of spectacular.

315
00:15:31,261 --> 00:15:32,421
- It's good, right?
- Yes.

316
00:15:33,381 --> 00:15:35,403
Well, do you want some fruit
and sweets?

317
00:15:35,404 --> 00:15:36,363
I got them there.

318
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,940
Listen to the sizzle.

319
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:49,700
You twerp!

320
00:15:50,301 --> 00:15:51,901
How dare you come to Luo's Residence?

321
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:52,980
How did you get in?

322
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,781
- I...
- I don't care who you are.

323
00:15:54,848 --> 00:15:56,900
How could you come
to this place without permission

324
00:15:57,021 --> 00:15:58,661
and speak to a lady alone?

325
00:15:59,501 --> 00:16:00,820
You're right, I was out of line.

326
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:02,416
The Literary Feast is starting.
Let's go.

327
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:04,661
But the meat... No, I mustn't waste it.

328
00:16:06,421 --> 00:16:07,340
Here you go.

329
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:08,580
Eat it.

330
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,781
- Is it not fully cooked?
- Hey, Lian Hong.

331
00:16:12,832 --> 00:16:14,910
Clear it quickly.
Make sure my mother doesn't find out.

332
00:16:14,912 --> 00:16:15,488
Let's go.

333
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:16,460
Go!

334
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:19,641
Be careful.

335
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:20,541
Young Master.

336
00:16:23,195 --> 00:16:25,034
Here you are, Young Master.

337
00:16:25,392 --> 00:16:26,864
The Literary Feast is starting, is it?

338
00:16:26,901 --> 00:16:27,381
Yes.

339
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,181
Let's go.

340
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:45,541
Step inside.

341
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:46,421
Take a seat.

342
00:16:52,381 --> 00:16:53,860
You're going to perform later.

343
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,541
Where were you, huffing and puffing?

344
00:16:55,629 --> 00:16:56,708
I'm sorry, Mother.

345
00:16:56,828 --> 00:16:57,908
I was feeling unwell.

346
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:00,133
Yixiu woke up feeling not well

347
00:17:00,501 --> 00:17:02,100
but she still showed up.

348
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,460
Are you alright?

349
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,501
I'm fine, Mother, don't worry.

350
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:10,580
What is it?

351
00:17:16,301 --> 00:17:16,900
Here.

352
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:27,660
Shenyuan.

353
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:29,820
Long time no see.

354
00:17:31,741 --> 00:17:32,580
Mr. Cheng.

355
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,040
I didn't expect to see you
at the Literary Feast.

356
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:38,280
I'm not interested in writing
and sharing poetry.

357
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:39,221
But,

358
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:40,741
the weather is great,

359
00:17:40,864 --> 00:17:42,420
perfect for a stroll and flower viewing.

360
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,981
Why don't we enjoy it together?

361
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,420
The banquet hall is this way. Please.

362
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:02,820
Third Young Master Cheng
is watching Luo Shenyuan.

363
00:18:02,941 --> 00:18:03,820
He sent word.

364
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:05,340
Luo Shenyuan's personal aide

365
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,288
is acting suspiciously.

366
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:07,741
I got someone to trail him.

367
00:18:08,193 --> 00:18:10,074
Since the fish has swum to the surface,

368
00:18:10,128 --> 00:18:11,220
it's time to retrieve the net.

369
00:18:11,501 --> 00:18:11,900
Yes, sir.

370
00:18:14,781 --> 00:18:15,941
Good day, Marquis Lu.

371
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:17,380
There's a literary event here today.

372
00:18:17,981 --> 00:18:19,221
Is there a reason

373
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,541
for Your Lordship's visit?

374
00:18:20,701 --> 00:18:22,420
Although I am
a martial arts practitioner,

375
00:18:22,781 --> 00:18:24,580
I do admire the artistry of the pen.

376
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:25,301
Well...

377
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:26,021
What is it?

378
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,919
Is Marquis Lu not welcomed?

379
00:18:28,741 --> 00:18:30,221
Oh, we wouldn't dare.

380
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,221
Allow me to go and inform

381
00:18:32,222 --> 00:18:34,420
Second Master and Old Madam to...

382
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:35,301
It's fine.

383
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:36,380
What...

384
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,479
Madam Chen.

385
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,340
The young ladies are ready.

386
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,301
Let's go.

387
00:18:52,061 --> 00:18:52,501
Okay.

388
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:58,261
Today, the city's young talents
are gathered here.

389
00:18:58,461 --> 00:19:00,981
It's an opportunity for you all
to show what you can do.

390
00:19:02,501 --> 00:19:03,620
Don't be nervous.

391
00:19:04,061 --> 00:19:06,021
You've been practicing pipa since young.

392
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,501
Your skill is one,

393
00:19:07,502 --> 00:19:08,943
if not the best in the capital.

394
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,261
Be confident and go.

395
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:11,741
Go on.

396
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:26,981
Your Lordship.

397
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,881
Minglan.

398
00:19:38,301 --> 00:19:39,701
Do you remember

399
00:19:39,701 --> 00:19:41,021
Liu Family's eldest son

400
00:19:41,021 --> 00:19:42,501
whom I mentioned before?

401
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,461
Today, Mrs. Liu

402
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,501
is here with her eldest son.

403
00:19:46,946 --> 00:19:49,466
I went and took a look for you just now.

404
00:19:49,741 --> 00:19:52,541
Be it his character or looks,
he is above average.

405
00:19:52,589 --> 00:19:54,749
He's about to sit
for the imperial exam, too.

406
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:57,100
Why don't you take this opportunity

407
00:19:57,261 --> 00:19:59,900
to get to know Mrs. Liu?

408
00:20:01,140 --> 00:20:03,180
If he's sitting for the imperial exam,

409
00:20:03,301 --> 00:20:05,140
I worry that discussing marriage now

410
00:20:05,261 --> 00:20:07,580
would affect Young Master Liu's results.

411
00:20:07,781 --> 00:20:09,061
Yiyu is still very young.

412
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,180
There's no rush.

413
00:20:10,466 --> 00:20:12,426
Why not hold it off for now?

414
00:20:34,741 --> 00:20:35,461
Chen Daoyan.

415
00:20:35,808 --> 00:20:36,810
Marquis Lu had predicted

416
00:20:36,832 --> 00:20:38,620
you'd use this time
to leave Luo's Residence.

417
00:20:38,624 --> 00:20:39,940
Surrender before it's too late.

418
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:45,900
Who are you?

419
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:46,620
I...

420
00:20:47,061 --> 00:20:48,860
It's a misunderstanding, Commander Ye.

421
00:20:48,864 --> 00:20:50,590
He is a physician
from the medical department.

422
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,860
A maid is feeling unwell.

423
00:20:51,888 --> 00:20:52,860
Madam Lin is benevolent

424
00:20:52,981 --> 00:20:54,701
and asked him to come
to take a look.

425
00:20:56,501 --> 00:20:57,501
A physician?

426
00:21:00,021 --> 00:21:01,981
Then why was he sneaking around?

427
00:21:02,301 --> 00:21:03,900
And why is he wearing a pupil's uniform?

428
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,541
He is here to check on
the madam's personal condition.

429
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:07,820
There are many nobles here today

430
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:09,408
and we didn't want
to affect our reputation.

431
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,560
We have to be more cautious.

432
00:21:11,152 --> 00:21:12,208
Are you still going to lie?

433
00:21:12,221 --> 00:21:13,461
Where on earth is Chen Daoyan?

434
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:14,380
Speak up!

435
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:16,368
Commander Ye, what are you asking?

436
00:21:16,369 --> 00:21:17,688
I don't get it at all.

437
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:19,740
Guests are gathered
for the Literary Feast.

438
00:21:19,741 --> 00:21:21,900
If anything goes awry,
my head is going to roll,

439
00:21:21,943 --> 00:21:22,703
Commander Ye.

440
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,620
Mr. Cheng, please.

441
00:22:28,272 --> 00:22:30,660
When the strings pause,
and the notes fade beneath the fingers,

442
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,340
a deeper emotion lingers,
layer upon layer.

443
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:35,701
When I came to visit before,

444
00:22:35,941 --> 00:22:38,461
I hadn't known Yiyu
was such a talented qin player.

445
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,221
Mr. Cheng.

446
00:22:44,592 --> 00:22:46,060
When we learned of your visit today,

447
00:22:46,221 --> 00:22:48,741
the two of us went to wait for you
at the door.

448
00:22:48,860 --> 00:22:50,100
But we didn't see you.

449
00:22:50,261 --> 00:22:51,301
Apologies, young sirs.

450
00:22:51,784 --> 00:22:53,345
I bumped into Shenyuan on the way

451
00:22:53,461 --> 00:22:54,620
and decided to come together.

452
00:22:55,221 --> 00:22:57,140
How is he qualified to take part?

453
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,380
Let's enjoy the tune first.

454
00:22:58,781 --> 00:23:00,981
The pipa playing is quite good.

455
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:03,981
It interplays
with the guzheng beautifully.

456
00:23:44,461 --> 00:23:47,261
Yixiu, are you feeling unwell?

457
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,541
My stomach hurts.

458
00:24:05,140 --> 00:24:06,580
Go and see what's wrong.

459
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:11,701
Seventh Sister, you play.

460
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,660
I don't know how.

461
00:24:12,741 --> 00:24:14,221
I only know one song.

462
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,660
It's fine. Just play what you know.

463
00:24:15,661 --> 00:24:16,861
I'll follow the pipa's lead.

464
00:24:48,021 --> 00:24:49,301
How come it's this tune?

465
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,499
Other young ladies learn tunes

466
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,664
like Spring Snowfall,
Blooming Flowers and a Full Moon.

467
00:25:27,941 --> 00:25:28,741
But you?

468
00:25:29,021 --> 00:25:30,380
You insisted on learning this song.

469
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:33,595
A hero at the end of his road.
The Conqueror Disarms.

470
00:25:33,595 --> 00:25:34,394
I like it.

471
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:47,981
Am I that terrible?

472
00:25:48,501 --> 00:25:49,619
When other people play,

473
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:51,620
it's like beads of different sizes
dropping on jade.

474
00:25:51,981 --> 00:25:55,380
While your playing
is like cotton fluffing.

475
00:25:55,392 --> 00:25:56,704
The hero must be meeting his end.

476
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,480
It makes me sad to listen to it.

477
00:25:58,567 --> 00:25:59,127
How dare you!

478
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:02,941
Never mind.

479
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:05,900
This song is hard to master.

480
00:26:06,461 --> 00:26:07,741
Once I'm done with the assignment,

481
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:09,380
I'll teach you again.

482
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:12,061
I'm not waiting around.
I want to learn it now.

483
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:21,021
You're here, Mr. Wang.
Please head inside.

484
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:21,701
Second Master.

485
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:24,741
Marquis Lu is here.

486
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:28,261
Marquis Lu.

487
00:26:28,781 --> 00:26:30,941
Your Lordship,
I'm honored by your attendance.

488
00:26:32,416 --> 00:26:33,072
Your Lordship,

489
00:26:33,744 --> 00:26:34,980
I wasn't aware you were coming

490
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,380
and was occupied.

491
00:26:36,461 --> 00:26:37,860
If you had informed me earlier,

492
00:26:37,981 --> 00:26:39,380
I would've greeted you at the door.

493
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:00,541
Yiyu!

494
00:27:05,501 --> 00:27:06,140
Bravo!

495
00:27:25,941 --> 00:27:27,580
This rendition of The Conqueror Disarms

496
00:27:27,701 --> 00:27:29,701
is indeed quite good.

497
00:27:40,941 --> 00:27:41,501
Marquis Lu!

498
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:08,221
Your Lordship, why don't I

499
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:09,501
show you to your seat?

500
00:28:09,941 --> 00:28:10,580
Marquis Lu.

501
00:28:11,501 --> 00:28:12,860
Don't be rude.

502
00:28:17,741 --> 00:28:19,741
This area is where
the female members perform.

503
00:28:20,301 --> 00:28:23,021
Please take a seat at the banquet area.

504
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,701
That's right, Your Lordship.

505
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,941
Men and women should keep
a distance after all.

506
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,180
Step aside.

507
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:45,180
Seventh Lady,
how come you know this song?

508
00:28:50,461 --> 00:28:52,660
The Conqueror Disarms is a pipa classic.

509
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,180
It's a favorite among many musicians.

510
00:28:54,741 --> 00:28:56,021
So it's not that surprising

511
00:28:56,064 --> 00:28:57,104
Seventh Lady knows it.

512
00:29:05,461 --> 00:29:07,775
Marquis Lu, your attendance today

513
00:29:07,781 --> 00:29:10,100
is a great honor to Luo's Residence.

514
00:29:10,461 --> 00:29:12,781
If you wouldn't mind my asking,
Your Lordship,

515
00:29:12,902 --> 00:29:14,541
are you here to attend the feast

516
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:16,904
or are you carrying out official duties?

517
00:29:19,781 --> 00:29:22,541
If you're a guest of Luo's Residence,

518
00:29:22,701 --> 00:29:25,100
then please take a seat over there.

519
00:29:25,301 --> 00:29:26,541
If it's an official duty,

520
00:29:26,981 --> 00:29:30,021
then please show me the official notice.

521
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:32,659
The entire household

522
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,900
will be ready to assist.

523
00:29:35,461 --> 00:29:36,180
Old Madam Luo,

524
00:29:37,021 --> 00:29:37,820
I am here

525
00:29:38,301 --> 00:29:40,021
to ask Seventh Lady a few questions.

526
00:29:40,701 --> 00:29:42,100
Seventh Lady, are you...

527
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:42,981
Your Lordship.

528
00:29:44,541 --> 00:29:49,100
My granddaughter
has no relation to you.

529
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,900
Please remain respectable.

530
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,239
Although Luo's Residence

531
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,040
is not as distinguished
as Marquis's Residence,

532
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,781
we are still considered

533
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:00,021
a proper scholarly family.

534
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:02,860
Go and get it treated.

535
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,301
Your Lordship.

536
00:30:10,461 --> 00:30:11,420
Please take a seat.

537
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,121
Mr. Sun has arrived.

538
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,620
Greetings, Mr. Sun.

539
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:27,021
Be at ease, everyone.

540
00:30:33,104 --> 00:30:35,168
Your Lordship, excuse me
while I greet the guest.

541
00:30:41,061 --> 00:30:42,741
Mr. Sun is here.

542
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,860
I am truly honored.

543
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,301
You're too kind, Registrar Luo.

544
00:30:47,981 --> 00:30:49,501
Nice to meet you, Mr. Sun.

545
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:54,021
Marquis Lu is the head
of the Imperial Guards.

546
00:30:54,032 --> 00:30:55,900
You're an expert
in military strategies, archery,

547
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,136
and have superb martial skills.

548
00:30:57,232 --> 00:30:59,020
Do you also have
an interest in writing?

549
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:01,620
You jest, Mr. Sun.

550
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,580
I only know my way with a sword.

551
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,180
I just came here to join in the fun.

552
00:31:16,307 --> 00:31:17,067
Just now

553
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,021
I shouldn't have played
The Conqueror Disarms.

554
00:31:20,922 --> 00:31:22,283
I'm not doing a good job.

555
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:24,061
If only Qing Qu is here.

556
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:27,061
I wonder

557
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:29,061
how Qing Qu is doing.

558
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:32,140
Hurry up, move it inside.

559
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:40,900
Unload the things and put them

560
00:31:40,981 --> 00:31:42,261
in the storeroom in the backyard.

561
00:31:42,660 --> 00:31:44,061
I have to prepare thank you gifts

562
00:31:44,076 --> 00:31:45,276
for the invited guests.

563
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:46,580
After the event ends,

564
00:31:46,653 --> 00:31:47,653
Madam Lin and Seventh Lady

565
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:48,841
will check them one by one.

566
00:31:50,061 --> 00:31:50,701
Understood.

567
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:57,820
Not only is Mr. Sun a great scholar
of our time,

568
00:31:57,863 --> 00:31:59,022
but also an imperial tutor.

569
00:31:59,104 --> 00:32:01,088
To have you share your teachings
at Luo's Residence

570
00:32:01,221 --> 00:32:02,741
is a great fortune to us.

571
00:32:02,781 --> 00:32:03,741
I'm flattered.

572
00:32:04,021 --> 00:32:05,701
Mr. Sun, please take a seat.

573
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,660
- Let's go together.
- You first.

574
00:32:07,941 --> 00:32:08,620
Alright.

575
00:32:11,261 --> 00:32:13,180
Marquis Lu, please.

576
00:32:19,261 --> 00:32:20,100
Registrar Luo.

577
00:32:20,541 --> 00:32:21,820
I met your father

578
00:32:21,846 --> 00:32:23,245
at the Literary Feast.

579
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:26,623
I was lucky to witness schools
contending in the literary world.

580
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,781
After Wenzhai passed away,

581
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,860
it truly warms my heart
that Luo's Residence

582
00:32:30,981 --> 00:32:32,461
is holding the Literary Feast again.

583
00:32:33,061 --> 00:32:34,580
You flatter us.

584
00:32:35,301 --> 00:32:38,180
We hope you'll share
your insight with us today.

585
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,860
Let's get down to business, then.

586
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:41,380
This is the Literary Feast.

587
00:32:41,616 --> 00:32:43,416
So there has to be a theme.

588
00:32:43,781 --> 00:32:45,261
Anyone on the floor

589
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,741
has any ideas?

590
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:55,380
Marquis Lu?

591
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,340
My purpose for coming here today

592
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:01,941
is to search for a person.

593
00:33:10,221 --> 00:33:11,580
How about this, Mr. Sun?

594
00:33:11,941 --> 00:33:14,140
We are seeking
useful people for the court.

595
00:33:14,261 --> 00:33:16,301
These talented young men
have been studying hard

596
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:18,701
for the sake of finding the truth
in their hearts.

597
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:21,541
Why don't we set the theme
using the word "search"?

598
00:33:21,694 --> 00:33:23,734
What do you think, Mr. Sun?

599
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:27,701
Search.

600
00:33:28,941 --> 00:33:30,541
That's a wonderful idea.

601
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:34,501
The road ahead is long and arduous.

602
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,900
But I will go to all corners in search.

603
00:33:37,221 --> 00:33:39,501
Fellow scholars,
you're free to explore topics.

604
00:33:39,504 --> 00:33:40,940
Poetry and prose are all acceptable.

605
00:33:41,180 --> 00:33:42,820
The time is set to 15 minutes.

606
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,221
Go ahead.

607
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:34,501
Young masters.

608
00:34:34,941 --> 00:34:36,861
Time is up.

609
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:38,260
How did it go?

610
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,501
Since this is the Luos homeground,

611
00:34:48,821 --> 00:34:49,580
why don't we

612
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,580
invite the Luos' sons to start first?

613
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,061
Shanyuan.

614
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,541
You're the oldest.

615
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:04,541
You go first.

616
00:35:19,941 --> 00:35:23,660
The reeds bloom silently
along the river in autumn,

617
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:27,541
stirring endless sorrow.

618
00:35:27,821 --> 00:35:30,821
Half the sun sinks in the horizon
as two lines of geese fly anew.

619
00:35:31,981 --> 00:35:34,260
A solitary boat drifts.

620
00:35:34,941 --> 00:35:36,580
The sentences are structured nicely.

621
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:38,981
But we're in the height
of summer presently.

622
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,461
Where is this autumn scene from?

623
00:35:40,941 --> 00:35:42,901
You force the sentiment
in order to use the words.

624
00:35:43,021 --> 00:35:44,381
That's no good.

625
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:47,100
I didn't see the word "search"

626
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:48,901
nor the idea of seeking.

627
00:35:48,981 --> 00:35:49,700
You're off-topic.

628
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,421
Sit down.

629
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:02,140
Xuanyuan, you go.

630
00:36:22,368 --> 00:36:23,984
Leaning on the railing, hand in hand,

631
00:36:24,032 --> 00:36:25,460
a hundred years pass like a dream.

632
00:36:25,904 --> 00:36:27,860
The sun and moon
race like arrows through time.

633
00:36:29,021 --> 00:36:30,541
The first half is pretty good.

634
00:36:36,541 --> 00:36:39,780
Xuanyuan, don't be nervous. Continue.

635
00:36:40,944 --> 00:36:42,496
Leaning on the railing, hand in hand,

636
00:36:42,544 --> 00:36:44,048
a hundred years pass like a dream.

637
00:36:44,384 --> 00:36:46,336
The sun and moon
race like arrows through time.

638
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,512
Reflecting on the past,
pondering the present.

639
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,220
Thousands...

640
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,341
Thousands...

641
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:54,421
Xuanyuan!

642
00:36:59,461 --> 00:37:01,021
Sorry you had to see that.

643
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,461
Mother.

644
00:37:05,501 --> 00:37:06,861
I'm ashamed

645
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,901
of failing to teach Shan properly.

646
00:37:09,461 --> 00:37:10,341
Grandma,

647
00:37:10,421 --> 00:37:11,861
Xuan must have been too fatigued.

648
00:37:11,941 --> 00:37:13,461
He's usually a great writer.

649
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:15,620
Could you give him another chance

650
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,260
once he wakes up?

651
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,821
What's the point in saying that now?

652
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:22,021
I'm afraid Luo's Residence reputation

653
00:37:22,341 --> 00:37:23,700
is at risk today.

654
00:37:24,461 --> 00:37:25,780
Fret not, Registrar Luo.

655
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,300
Xuanyuan probably exhausted himself

656
00:37:28,421 --> 00:37:30,461
preparing for today's event.

657
00:37:31,541 --> 00:37:32,461
Registrar Luo.

658
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,359
Your son

659
00:37:34,421 --> 00:37:36,100
seems to have stage fright.

660
00:37:36,381 --> 00:37:37,861
Does that mean no one can carry on

661
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,620
Old Master Luo's literary prestige?

662
00:37:43,712 --> 00:37:45,968
Luo's Residence has been respected
for a century.

663
00:37:46,021 --> 00:37:48,780
Marquis Lu shouldn't make
such rash conclusions.

664
00:37:54,821 --> 00:37:55,660
Luo Shenyuan.

665
00:37:56,114 --> 00:37:57,793
You've never even been home-schooled.

666
00:37:57,981 --> 00:37:59,421
This is no place for you to speak up.

667
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,180
Sit down, now.

668
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:04,580
Hang on.

669
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:07,580
This young man.

670
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,901
Is he also a member of the Luos?

671
00:38:12,901 --> 00:38:13,901
He...

672
00:38:16,224 --> 00:38:18,176
He is the Third Young Master
of Luo's Residence,

673
00:38:18,224 --> 00:38:18,848
Luo Shenyuan.

674
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,341
Greetings, Mr. Sun.

675
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:27,061
Yining.

676
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,901
What is a lady like you doing out there?

677
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:30,941
Father.

678
00:38:31,421 --> 00:38:33,501
There are some things I have to say.

679
00:38:33,861 --> 00:38:35,180
Since this is the Literary Feast,

680
00:38:35,381 --> 00:38:37,140
it should be all-inclusive.

681
00:38:37,341 --> 00:38:38,740
A hero is not judged by his origin,

682
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:40,656
and talent is not judged
by the family background.

683
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:42,501
That's the essence
of the Literary Feast.

684
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,240
It also fits the vision
of Luo's Residence

685
00:38:44,304 --> 00:38:45,540
over the past century.

686
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,021
Seventh Lady.

687
00:38:54,256 --> 00:38:55,860
You're not only proficient at the qin,

688
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,981
but also an eloquent speaker.

689
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,648
Thanks for the compliment, Marquis Lu.

690
00:39:01,728 --> 00:39:03,300
What the Seventh Lady said

691
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:06,061
is non too different
from Wenzhai's idea before.

692
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:08,620
Back then, Wenzhai
had organized the Literary Feast

693
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:11,220
exactly to give an opportunity
for all talented individuals

694
00:39:11,381 --> 00:39:13,381
to showcase their skills.

695
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:14,861
He once said,

696
00:39:14,981 --> 00:39:17,580
Luo's Residence Literary Feast
is only about talent and learning.

697
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:19,740
The rest do not matter.

698
00:39:20,901 --> 00:39:22,620
Mr. Sun is right.

699
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:24,821
Old Master Luo was broad-minded,

700
00:39:24,941 --> 00:39:26,061
ahead of his time.

701
00:39:26,096 --> 00:39:28,192
He is truly a role model
for our generation of scholars.

702
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:36,941
If that's the case,

703
00:39:41,941 --> 00:39:43,180
step up, then.

704
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:48,660
Okay.

705
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:06,660
Please take a look.

706
00:40:12,461 --> 00:40:14,341
The wind rises,
stirring waves upon waves.

707
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:17,260
Snow clears,
revealing ten thousand peaks.

708
00:40:17,901 --> 00:40:19,660
In youth, I aspired to reach the clouds,

709
00:40:20,021 --> 00:40:22,580
yet tonight, I am shrouded in dust.

710
00:40:23,021 --> 00:40:25,100
Chasing dreams in foreign lands,

711
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:27,541
I lie drunk
at the graves of old friends.

712
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,861
Rising to dance with a long sword,

713
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:34,341
I have no fear of binding
the celestial dragon.

714
00:40:38,821 --> 00:40:40,740
Despite the passing of time,

715
00:40:40,861 --> 00:40:42,861
the youth's ambition remains unchanged.

716
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:45,061
Looking for a youthful spirit,

717
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,700
and expressing one's inner feelings.

718
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,580
Good aspiration.

719
00:40:51,021 --> 00:40:52,541
Good stanzas.

720
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:55,616
Thank you for the compliments, Mr. Sun.

721
00:40:56,381 --> 00:40:57,341
Registrar Luo.

722
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,941
With such a descendant,

723
00:41:00,061 --> 00:41:02,260
he will surely bring honor
to Luo's Residence.

724
00:41:02,541 --> 00:41:05,700
There's someone to take up
Wenzhai's mantle now.

725
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:08,421
We're flattered.

726
00:41:13,061 --> 00:41:15,501
To gain Mr. Sun's praise,

727
00:41:15,573 --> 00:41:17,213
Third Young Master Luo is truly outstanding.

728
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:26,020
You're named Luo Shenyuan?

729
00:41:26,021 --> 00:41:27,501
That's right, Mr. Sun.

730
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:32,501
A gentleman is cautious
and carries lofty aspirations.

731
00:41:32,981 --> 00:41:34,220
It's a good name.

732
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,220
We didn't have a chance to talk more

733
00:41:36,341 --> 00:41:38,021
when I bumped into you at the bookstore.

734
00:41:38,381 --> 00:41:39,381
I didn't expect

735
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:41,300
you to be a member of the Luos.

736
00:41:41,421 --> 00:41:42,981
I didn't recognize you that day.

737

I've been studying on my own
during my free time.

00:41:56,501 --> 00:41:57,821
Young Master Shenyuan.

743
00:41:58,941 --> 00:42:00,941
Are you willing to join my school?

Pupil Shenyuan
pays respect to his teacher.

745

747
00:42:12,501 --> 00:42:14,700
I will follow your teachings
and study hard.

749
00:42:19,341 --> 00:42:21,821
Good, that's good.
