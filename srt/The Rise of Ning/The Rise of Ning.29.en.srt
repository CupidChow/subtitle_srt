00:01:40,244 --> 00:01:42,080
(Luo Residence)

5
00:01:52,431 --> 00:01:53,256
Mother.

6
00:01:53,337 --> 00:01:54,149
Grandma.

7
00:01:54,485 --> 00:01:56,040
You're awake? Don't move.

8
00:01:56,121 --> 00:01:57,000
Don't move.

9
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,600
I've come late

10
00:02:02,125 --> 00:02:03,829
and made you suffer.

11
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,204
I should have returned sooner

12
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,776
after I went to look for Physician Du

13
00:02:08,066 --> 00:02:09,480
so Yining

14
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:10,640
wouldn't be bullied.

15
00:02:14,087 --> 00:02:15,160
Grandma.

16
00:02:16,543 --> 00:02:17,383
Can I still

17
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,640
call you "Grandma" in the future?

18
00:02:21,595 --> 00:02:22,880
Silly girl.

19
00:02:23,846 --> 00:02:25,040
You will

20
00:02:25,251 --> 00:02:26,640
always be

21
00:02:26,781 --> 00:02:28,240
the closest child to me.

22
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,040
I have

23
00:02:33,321 --> 00:02:34,642
something very important

24
00:02:34,723 --> 00:02:36,000
to tell you.

25
00:02:37,517 --> 00:02:38,680
However,

26
00:02:39,437 --> 00:02:41,649
I don't know how to tell you.

27
00:02:43,715 --> 00:02:45,840
Hairu, tell her.

28
00:02:48,438 --> 00:02:49,556
Mother, I...

29
00:02:54,695 --> 00:02:56,415
It's fine. Tell me, Grandma.

30
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,560
Your

31
00:02:59,676 --> 00:03:00,960
biological father,

32
00:03:01,941 --> 00:03:02,960
Duke Ying,

33
00:03:03,294 --> 00:03:05,360
is waiting for you at the yard.

34
00:03:06,861 --> 00:03:08,400
Do you want to meet him?

35
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,040
Mother,

36
00:03:19,278 --> 00:03:20,880
this is too sudden

37
00:03:20,961 --> 00:03:21,960
for Yining.

38
00:03:22,712 --> 00:03:24,726
Why don't we give her some more time?

39
00:03:25,853 --> 00:03:26,812
Yining,

40
00:03:27,613 --> 00:03:30,080
he is your biological father.

41
00:03:30,796 --> 00:03:31,760
I was the one

42
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,520
who gave the divorce letter
to your third brother

43
00:03:34,768 --> 00:03:36,350
and asked him to do everything he could

44
00:03:36,434 --> 00:03:37,720
to find your father

45
00:03:38,165 --> 00:03:40,205
so your father

46
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:42,760
could reunite with you openly.

47
00:03:44,214 --> 00:03:45,015
In the future,

48
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,431
your background

49
00:03:46,485 --> 00:03:48,235
will not be criticized,

50
00:03:48,316 --> 00:03:49,235
Yining.

51
00:03:51,805 --> 00:03:52,645
Grandma.

52
00:03:54,687 --> 00:03:55,607
Is Duke Ying

53
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,999
really my biological father?

54
00:04:00,279 --> 00:04:01,320
Yes.

55
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,640
You should ask him

56
00:04:06,848 --> 00:04:09,260
about what happened
between him and your mother back then.

57
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,120
Duke Ying.

58
00:04:27,807 --> 00:04:28,607
Go ahead.

59
00:04:59,469 --> 00:05:00,270
Yining.

60
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:10,240
Yining,

61
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,960
are you feeling better?

62
00:05:12,903 --> 00:05:13,742
I'm fine.

63
00:05:14,593 --> 00:05:15,552
Sit down.

64
00:05:30,142 --> 00:05:31,016
Actually,

65
00:05:32,352 --> 00:05:34,800
we've met in the residence.

66
00:05:36,215 --> 00:05:37,736
Earlier,

67
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,590
I also met you once.

68
00:05:44,888 --> 00:05:46,568
If Heaven is fair,

69
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,556
I was supposed

70
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,800
to witness your birth.

71
00:05:57,501 --> 00:05:58,920
How did you

72
00:05:59,898 --> 00:06:01,280
know my mother?

73
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:06,559
Back then,

74
00:06:07,232 --> 00:06:09,440
I got seriously injured
from dealing with bandits

75
00:06:10,126 --> 00:06:11,563
and got trapped on Mount Fenghuang.

76
00:06:12,453 --> 00:06:14,560
I only had a guard by my side.

77
00:06:14,942 --> 00:06:16,421
He wanted to call for help

78
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,920
but he was worried
about leaving me alone

79
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,231
so

80
00:06:21,294 --> 00:06:23,040
he got someone to take care of me.

81
00:06:23,864 --> 00:06:25,143
Was that person my mother?

82
00:06:28,358 --> 00:06:30,158
He picked your mother

83
00:06:30,392 --> 00:06:31,880
after going through many families

84
00:06:32,294 --> 00:06:34,040
because your mother's face

85
00:06:34,872 --> 00:06:36,680
looked like a kind person.

86
00:06:39,888 --> 00:06:40,888
She heard

87
00:06:41,248 --> 00:06:43,120
I got injured
from dealing with the bandits

88
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:46,120
and took care of me
regardless of danger.

89
00:06:46,687 --> 00:06:48,000
That was how I could recover.

90
00:06:48,868 --> 00:06:49,949
At the same time,

91
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,280
I also fell for her.

92
00:06:54,887 --> 00:06:56,286
Your mother's appearance

93
00:06:56,919 --> 00:06:58,840
might not be extremely pretty

94
00:06:59,535 --> 00:07:00,335
but

95
00:07:00,942 --> 00:07:02,960
she was the kindest
and most meticulous lady

96
00:07:04,729 --> 00:07:07,649
I've met in my life.

97
00:07:09,317 --> 00:07:10,477
In that case,

98
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:13,760
why did you hide your identity?

99
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:16,069
Back then,

100
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,521
I was in danger.

101
00:07:18,949 --> 00:07:20,080
I had my concerns.

102
00:07:20,653 --> 00:07:22,200
I was worried I might bring harm to her

103
00:07:22,593 --> 00:07:23,913
if she knew too much.

104
00:07:24,864 --> 00:07:25,800
As for her,

105
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:27,430
she was worried

106
00:07:28,062 --> 00:07:29,760
about her own reputation

107
00:07:30,432 --> 00:07:31,759
so she didn't tell me

108
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,160
her real name.

109
00:07:34,406 --> 00:07:35,766
After I got rid of the bandits,

110
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,080
I wanted to bring her here

111
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:40,446
but I received emergency news

112
00:07:40,496 --> 00:07:42,592
about your grandpa's dire situation
on the battlefield.

113
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,240
I was in a rush
to provide reinforcements

114
00:07:46,119 --> 00:07:47,320
so I missed out on meeting her.

115
00:07:48,238 --> 00:07:50,517
Unexpectedly, when I came back,

116
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,560
no one was there.

117
00:07:53,845 --> 00:07:54,765
Your mother

118
00:07:56,174 --> 00:07:58,575
vanished.

119
00:08:00,048 --> 00:08:02,032
I've been thinking for all these years.

120
00:08:02,551 --> 00:08:03,830
If I could

121
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,760
be more thorough in my consideration

122
00:08:06,071 --> 00:08:07,150
and not leave in a hurry,

123
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:08,799
I wouldn't miss out on your mother

124
00:08:08,895 --> 00:08:10,840
even if I had left her a letter.

125
00:08:12,453 --> 00:08:13,893
I've been looking for her

126
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:18,070
and blaming myself.

127
00:08:25,877 --> 00:08:26,677
Yining.

128
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,800
Do you know

129
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,720
how you got your name?

130
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,810
(May my daughter Yining live in peace
and be reunited with her loved ones.)

131
00:08:54,782 --> 00:08:57,886
A heart free of sorrow
and a peaceful world.

132
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,359
This is a mutual wish

133
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,720
of your mother and I.

134
00:09:06,056 --> 00:09:07,120
For all these years,

135
00:09:07,742 --> 00:09:09,382
I've made you both suffer.

136
00:09:10,518 --> 00:09:11,720
Your mother passed away.

137
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:14,134
Can you give me a chance

138
00:09:15,726 --> 00:09:17,290
for me to make up to you

139
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:18,931
as your father?

140
00:09:32,703 --> 00:09:33,503
All right.

141
00:09:35,599 --> 00:09:37,040
Recuperate well.

142
00:09:38,238 --> 00:09:39,598
You may make the decision

143
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,040
after you've recovered.

144
00:10:30,615 --> 00:10:31,654
Are you all right?

145
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:35,120
You gave the painting to Duke Ying

146
00:10:36,479 --> 00:10:37,839
and asked him to come here, right?

147
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,200
Actually, I wasn't around the residence

148
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,900
because I went
to investigate your background.

149
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,881
- Third Brother.
- Yining.

150
00:10:55,542 --> 00:10:57,382
I am not your third brother now.

151
00:10:59,141 --> 00:11:00,640
We are not siblings as well.

152
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:05,800
Even if we are not siblings by blood,

153
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:09,231
I will still be by your side

154
00:11:10,215 --> 00:11:11,095
to protect you.

155
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:30,813
♪It's complicated but I'm not afraid♪

156
00:11:31,462 --> 00:11:37,337
♪There's light in my heart♪

157
00:11:37,938 --> 00:11:44,840
♪Following the river of time
I dive into the whirlpool♪

158
00:11:45,126 --> 00:11:53,837
♪For the sake of you and mine

159
00:11:54,806 --> 00:12:01,615
♪I'm willing to risk my life

160
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,373
♪I'm willing to fall into the abyss
in order to reveal the fate♪

161
00:12:06,454 --> 00:12:08,175
(I've been thinking for all these years.)

162
00:12:08,935 --> 00:12:11,334
(If I could be more thorough
in my consideration)

163
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,359
(and not leave in a hurry,)

164
00:12:13,535 --> 00:12:15,000
(I wouldn't miss out on your mother)

165
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,299
(even if I had left her a letter.)

166
00:12:17,717 --> 00:12:19,038
I've been looking for her

167
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,321
and blaming myself.

168
00:12:24,574 --> 00:12:25,440
(For all these years,)

169
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:27,728
(I've made you both suffer.)

170
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,960
Can you give me a chance

171
00:12:32,183 --> 00:12:33,800
for me to make up to you

172
00:12:34,365 --> 00:12:35,520
as your father?

173
00:12:54,862 --> 00:12:56,280
Everything in the past

174
00:12:57,095 --> 00:12:58,440
happened due to twists of fates.

175
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:59,760
It wasn't her fault.

176
00:13:00,138 --> 00:13:01,774
He hasn't married after all these years

177
00:13:01,982 --> 00:13:04,255
and hasn't given up
on searching for your mother.

178
00:13:05,814 --> 00:13:07,080
He is a passionate lover.

179
00:13:07,757 --> 00:13:08,597
I know.

180
00:13:09,509 --> 00:13:10,589
Otherwise,

181
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,193
you wouldn't bring him to me.

182
00:13:15,974 --> 00:13:17,854
It's fine
if you don't want to accept him.

183
00:13:18,061 --> 00:13:19,560
He is not an unreasonable person.

184
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:20,981
He won't force you.

185
00:13:21,325 --> 00:13:22,880
Whether I accept him or not,

186
00:13:23,535 --> 00:13:25,160
he will still be my biological father.

187
00:13:25,725 --> 00:13:26,623
However,

188
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,080
I feel a little sick of it.

189
00:13:30,206 --> 00:13:31,006
Sick of it?

190
00:13:33,381 --> 00:13:35,720
I'm sick of life
where I can't make my own decisions.

191
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:37,040
Whether it's going to Luo Residence

192
00:13:37,334 --> 00:13:38,920
or Duke Ying's Residence,

193
00:13:39,854 --> 00:13:41,334
I'm just like a duckweed

194
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:43,245
with nothing to rely on.

195
00:13:48,509 --> 00:13:49,989
However, people who treat you well

196
00:13:50,765 --> 00:13:51,885
will never change.

197
00:13:52,397 --> 00:13:55,303
For example, Grandma, Mother,

198
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:56,590
and I.

199
00:13:59,822 --> 00:14:00,622
Let's go back.

200
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:19,310
Grandma.

201
00:14:19,876 --> 00:14:21,279
Allow me to bow to you.

202
00:14:23,555 --> 00:14:24,435
Ning,

203
00:14:24,803 --> 00:14:26,760
what are you doing? Get up quickly.

204
00:14:30,317 --> 00:14:31,117
Grandma,

205
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:33,570
I'm grateful for your love and guidance

206
00:14:33,686 --> 00:14:35,240
for all these years.

207
00:14:35,681 --> 00:14:36,481
In the future,

208
00:14:36,734 --> 00:14:39,115
I'm afraid I can't be filial
by your side anymore.

209
00:14:39,584 --> 00:14:40,534
However,

210
00:14:40,645 --> 00:14:42,440
I will come back and visit you often.

211
00:14:44,614 --> 00:14:45,414
Since you have

212
00:14:46,571 --> 00:14:48,120
made your decision,

213
00:14:49,226 --> 00:14:51,193
just do according to what you want.

214
00:14:52,924 --> 00:14:54,045
Thank you, Grandma.

215
00:15:00,795 --> 00:15:01,636
Father,

216
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:04,680
thank you for raising me
for all these years.

217
00:15:08,614 --> 00:15:09,414
Although

218
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:11,440
I am no longer your daughter,

219
00:15:11,821 --> 00:15:13,592
you were still my father before this.

220
00:15:23,435 --> 00:15:24,276
Mother,

221
00:15:25,046 --> 00:15:26,800
you've treated me like your own daughter

222
00:15:27,191 --> 00:15:28,271
and have loved me a lot.

223
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,756
No matter what happens,

224
00:15:30,222 --> 00:15:31,541
you will always

225
00:15:31,901 --> 00:15:33,582
be my mother.

226
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,840
Thank you, Mother.

227
00:15:48,667 --> 00:15:49,467
Yining,

228
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,040
let's go home.

229
00:15:55,175 --> 00:15:56,320
Thank you for saving me.

230
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,037
I won't be going back with you.

231
00:16:04,051 --> 00:16:06,678
Where are you going then?

232
00:16:08,016 --> 00:16:08,814
Grandma.

233
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,040
Actually, Sixth Uncle and I

234
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:12,608
have been hiding this from everyone.

235
00:16:12,688 --> 00:16:13,570
We have

236
00:16:13,657 --> 00:16:15,177
opened a rouge shop.

237
00:16:15,668 --> 00:16:17,631
I want to manage this shop well.

238
00:16:22,268 --> 00:16:23,256
I know

239
00:16:24,429 --> 00:16:25,840
these are all excuses.

240
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,016
I've never carried out my responsibility

241
00:16:28,107 --> 00:16:30,763
as a father over all these years

242
00:16:31,055 --> 00:16:32,888
so I made you suffer.

243
00:16:33,053 --> 00:16:34,173
I've let you

244
00:16:34,468 --> 00:16:35,720
and your mother down.

245
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:37,720
It is only right

246
00:16:38,388 --> 00:16:39,309
for you to blame me.

247
00:16:39,548 --> 00:16:41,053
I don't blame you.

248
00:16:42,854 --> 00:16:43,779
However,

249
00:16:44,174 --> 00:16:45,701
I have my own ideas.

250
00:16:46,175 --> 00:16:47,740
Even if you have your own ideas,

251
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:49,740
it shouldn't affect you going home.

252
00:16:50,404 --> 00:16:51,534
I've lost you

253
00:16:51,614 --> 00:16:52,694
for so many years.

254
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,490
I can only have more opportunities

255
00:16:55,592 --> 00:16:57,040
to make it up to you

256
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,240
if you stay with me.

257
00:17:00,773 --> 00:17:03,000
I just want to give it a try.

258
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,480
A female can also be independent

259
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:07,046
in this world

260
00:17:07,269 --> 00:17:09,630
by feeding herself with her own skills

261
00:17:09,886 --> 00:17:11,560
and taking care of the people she loves

262
00:17:11,942 --> 00:17:13,981
without needing
to rely on other people's support.

263
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:16,131
Yining.

264
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:17,782
If you want to open a shop,

265
00:17:18,061 --> 00:17:19,360
you can open it anywhere.

266
00:17:19,797 --> 00:17:21,720
It's more convenient
to stay in Luo Residence.

267
00:17:21,801 --> 00:17:22,880
I can also help you.

268
00:17:23,494 --> 00:17:24,294
It's all right.

269
00:17:25,276 --> 00:17:26,076
There's no need.

270
00:17:26,615 --> 00:17:27,495
I am here.

271
00:17:27,576 --> 00:17:28,631
I can help you at any time.

272
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,240
Besides opening a rouge shop,

273
00:17:30,288 --> 00:17:31,719
what other shops do you want to open?

274
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,810
Where do you want to open them?

275
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:34,019
Maxing Street or Royal Street?

276
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,344
How many shops do you want to open?

277
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,920
I'll help you get it done immediately.

278
00:17:37,205 --> 00:17:38,005
I...

279
00:17:39,774 --> 00:17:42,574
I only want to open a rouge shop.

280
00:17:46,556 --> 00:17:47,357
Mother,

281
00:17:47,747 --> 00:17:49,240
even if I don't stay here anymore,

282
00:17:49,484 --> 00:17:50,964
you will still help me

283
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,640
if I need your help, right?

284
00:17:52,716 --> 00:17:53,516
Of course.

285
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,171
In the future,
I still need to learn from you

286
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,632
when it comes to doing business.

287
00:18:00,106 --> 00:18:00,906
Duke Ying.

288
00:18:01,588 --> 00:18:03,120
Grandma. Father. Mother.

289
00:18:04,244 --> 00:18:06,034
It is rare for a lady like Yining

290
00:18:06,115 --> 00:18:07,285
to have her own idea

291
00:18:07,365 --> 00:18:08,605
to rely on herself

292
00:18:08,685 --> 00:18:10,284
to start a business.

293
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,280
I think we can

294
00:18:12,676 --> 00:18:14,995
let her try it out without any worries.

295
00:18:17,643 --> 00:18:18,443
I understand.

296
00:18:22,723 --> 00:18:23,523
Yining,

297
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:25,840
come to me if you face any trouble

298
00:18:26,306 --> 00:18:27,280
in the future.

299
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,640
If you have no troubles,

300
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:35,520
can I still come and visit you?

301
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,480
(Marquis Anbei Residence)

302
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,400
Marquis.

303
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,976
I asked you
to investigate Seventh Lady.

304
00:19:10,992 --> 00:19:11,740
How is it going?

305
00:19:11,885 --> 00:19:13,320
Seventh Lady's case is closed.

306
00:19:13,724 --> 00:19:15,000
She did not kill anyone.

307
00:19:15,714 --> 00:19:17,160
Mistress Qiao didn't die as well.

308
00:19:17,562 --> 00:19:18,362
However...

309
00:19:18,896 --> 00:19:19,760
What's wrong?

310
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:20,858
However,

311
00:19:21,136 --> 00:19:23,600
Seventh Lady isn't
a daughter from Luo Residence.

312
00:19:23,664 --> 00:19:24,840
She is Duke Ying's daughter.

313
00:19:29,857 --> 00:19:30,678
What did you say?

314
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,815
Yesterday,
Duke Ying went to Luo Residence

315
00:19:32,816 --> 00:19:34,320
to reunite with Seventh Lady.

316
00:19:34,443 --> 00:19:35,243
The news

317
00:19:35,324 --> 00:19:36,960
has spread all over the capital now.

318
00:19:38,752 --> 00:19:39,690
Did Seventh Lady

319
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,680
go back with him
to Duke Ying's Residence?

320
00:19:42,398 --> 00:19:43,198
Not yet.

321
00:20:24,947 --> 00:20:25,747
Mother.

322
00:20:29,782 --> 00:20:31,040
Who asked you to come here?

323
00:20:31,947 --> 00:20:34,306
Isn't it embarrassing
to have a mother like me?

324
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,861
Go away quickly!

325
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:41,240
Mother, I made you food. Try it.

326
00:20:53,902 --> 00:20:55,214
Now that it has come to this,

327
00:20:56,644 --> 00:20:58,760
whether I eat or not

328
00:20:59,253 --> 00:21:00,120
and what I eat

329
00:21:00,451 --> 00:21:01,600
make no difference.

330
00:21:02,605 --> 00:21:04,880
I'm also living my days
waiting for my death.

331
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:06,365
Mother,

332
00:21:06,587 --> 00:21:08,320
I know I've let you down

333
00:21:08,484 --> 00:21:11,128
but I couldn't hide my conscience and...

334
00:21:16,707 --> 00:21:18,108
You are so cruel.

335
00:21:20,317 --> 00:21:22,640
You can even abandon your own mother.

336
00:21:23,266 --> 00:21:25,121
You just wouldn't listen to me.

337
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:27,246
If you had listened to me,

338
00:21:27,628 --> 00:21:29,675
I would be Her Highness' in-law.

339
00:21:30,044 --> 00:21:31,885
Her Highness will also spare me

340
00:21:32,322 --> 00:21:34,120
for her own reputation.

341
00:21:45,738 --> 00:21:47,298
It's still not too late now.

342
00:21:47,405 --> 00:21:48,960
Go and find Han Zhao immediately.

343
00:21:49,324 --> 00:21:51,080
Tell him that you like him

344
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,240
and are willing to marry him.

345
00:21:52,324 --> 00:21:53,840
Ask him to give you another chance.

346
00:21:54,114 --> 00:21:54,914
Mother,

347
00:21:55,492 --> 00:21:56,492
right now,

348
00:21:56,755 --> 00:21:58,440
not only
do you not reflect on your mistakes

349
00:21:58,548 --> 00:21:59,628
but you are thinking of using

350
00:21:59,716 --> 00:22:00,956
me to marry Han Zhao.

351
00:22:01,044 --> 00:22:02,284
What is so bad about Han Zhao?

352
00:22:02,777 --> 00:22:04,320
How is he worse than Lin Mao?

353
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,600
You fool.

354
00:22:05,845 --> 00:22:06,805
If it wasn't for you,

355
00:22:06,885 --> 00:22:09,586
I would not be suffering
at a place like this.

356
00:22:17,445 --> 00:22:18,920
Calm down, Mother.

357
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:20,011
Don't be angry.

358
00:22:20,845 --> 00:22:21,925
She is still young.

359
00:22:22,365 --> 00:22:24,120
I will think of a way to bring you out.

360
00:22:31,365 --> 00:22:33,205
All of you shouldn't be here.

361
00:22:33,564 --> 00:22:34,511
- Silly Girl.
- Mother.

362
00:22:35,004 --> 00:22:37,125
I'm not really angry at me.

363
00:22:38,275 --> 00:22:39,916
I purposely made her hate me.

364
00:22:40,761 --> 00:22:42,298
Right now, both of you

365
00:22:42,548 --> 00:22:44,028
should cut ties with me.

366
00:22:44,324 --> 00:22:45,720
Don't visit me

367
00:22:45,925 --> 00:22:47,885
and don't think about saving me.

368
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:49,499
Promise me

369
00:22:50,097 --> 00:22:51,621
not to beg anyone else.

370
00:22:51,843 --> 00:22:53,520
Go and live your own lives.

371
00:22:53,761 --> 00:22:55,325
Forget that you have such a mother.

372
00:22:55,405 --> 00:22:56,244
Mother!

373
00:23:15,532 --> 00:23:16,332
Yixiu.

374
00:23:16,761 --> 00:23:18,441
We should go and find Her Highness.

375
00:23:19,764 --> 00:23:21,365
Even if you won't marry him,

376
00:23:21,571 --> 00:23:23,172
Young Master Han is kind.

377
00:23:23,341 --> 00:23:24,800
Perhaps he is willing to help.

378
00:23:25,228 --> 00:23:26,480
It's better even if he is

379
00:23:26,561 --> 00:23:28,081
going to reduce Mother's sentence.

380
00:23:29,044 --> 00:23:30,084
Yiyu,

381
00:23:30,274 --> 00:23:32,034
Mother murdered someone.

382
00:23:32,048 --> 00:23:34,280
Not only did she murder
Seventh Sister's biological mother,

383
00:23:34,285 --> 00:23:36,004
but she also
almost killed Seventh Sister.

384
00:23:36,084 --> 00:23:37,764
She is our mother after all.

385
00:23:38,204 --> 00:23:40,003
Besides betraying her in public,

386
00:23:40,084 --> 00:23:42,164
do you also want
to see her being banished

387
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,401
and die in another place?

388
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:44,800
Are you that cruel?

389
00:23:44,987 --> 00:23:46,667
Are you blaming me as well?

390
00:23:47,901 --> 00:23:49,680
I know I let Mother down

391
00:23:49,769 --> 00:23:51,033
but I knew the truth.

392
00:23:51,114 --> 00:23:52,875
I couldn't cover my conscience.

393
00:23:53,292 --> 00:23:54,092
All right.

394
00:23:56,356 --> 00:23:57,995
If you won't meet Her Highness,

395
00:23:58,032 --> 00:23:59,872
I will go and beg Madam Shen
at Shen Residence.

396
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:00,620
Stop.

397
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,756
Don't go. She won't help you.

398
00:24:03,325 --> 00:24:04,560
I still have to try.

399
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:06,645
Mother cannot
have two heartless daughters.

400
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,360
(Shen Residence)

401
00:24:21,149 --> 00:24:22,480
Her mother is a murderer.

402
00:24:22,564 --> 00:24:24,605
How can she still come here
to beg our madam?

403
00:24:25,317 --> 00:24:26,117
Exactly.

404
00:24:26,176 --> 00:24:27,824
She's trying to climb the social ladder

405
00:24:27,856 --> 00:24:29,440
without knowing who she is.

406
00:24:34,837 --> 00:24:35,877
Jiarou, this is great.

407
00:24:36,276 --> 00:24:37,918
Can you let me meet Madam Shen?

408
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,374
Luo Yiyu.

409
00:24:40,089 --> 00:24:41,600
How dare you pretend

410
00:24:41,681 --> 00:24:43,441
to be a noble lady in the past.

411
00:24:44,168 --> 00:24:45,164
Right now,

412
00:24:45,298 --> 00:24:46,499
you are just nothing much.

413
00:24:47,121 --> 00:24:48,920
I'll make it clear to you today.

414
00:24:49,496 --> 00:24:50,400
The Shen Residence

415
00:24:50,481 --> 00:24:52,640
is not willing
to get along with people like you.

416
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,480
Please don't come here again
in the future.

417
00:24:58,044 --> 00:24:58,845
Jiarou,

418
00:24:59,284 --> 00:25:00,204
for the sake

419
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:02,200
of our friendship in the past,

420
00:25:02,564 --> 00:25:03,925
please let me meet Madam Shen.

421
00:25:15,676 --> 00:25:16,476
Take it back.

422
00:25:18,244 --> 00:25:19,044
Luo Yiyu.

423
00:25:19,376 --> 00:25:21,360
You should save some dignity
for yourself at least.

424
00:25:37,312 --> 00:25:39,680
The parents are at fault
but the children are innocent.

425
00:25:42,384 --> 00:25:45,008
Young Lady Luo isn't supposed
to bear the blame for her mother.

426
00:25:45,091 --> 00:25:46,200
Speaking like that

427
00:25:46,535 --> 00:25:47,760
and hurting her

428
00:25:48,049 --> 00:25:49,680
is no different from killing someone!

429
00:25:51,074 --> 00:25:52,080
Who is he?

430
00:25:56,321 --> 00:25:57,121
Let's go.

431
00:26:04,003 --> 00:26:05,480
When I heard your family was in trouble,

432
00:26:05,504 --> 00:26:07,360
I couldn't help
but feel worried about you.

433
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,472
I went to your residence
and didn't see you just now.

434
00:26:09,523 --> 00:26:11,697
I figured
you were anxious about your mother

435
00:26:11,842 --> 00:26:12,963
so I asked around.

436
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:23,400
Your mother is different

437
00:26:24,813 --> 00:26:25,613
from you.

438
00:26:26,965 --> 00:26:27,765
In my heart,

439
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,880
you are always the pure Luo Yiyu.

440
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,353
As long as I'm around,

441
00:26:33,452 --> 00:26:34,932
I won't let anyone criticize you

442
00:26:35,469 --> 00:26:36,269
and hurt you.

443
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:44,290
Old Master, Fifth Young Lady is here.

444
00:26:51,205 --> 00:26:52,005
Grandma.

445
00:27:02,569 --> 00:27:03,569
Yilian,

446
00:27:04,459 --> 00:27:05,739
go to the temple.

447
00:27:06,314 --> 00:27:07,680
No, Grandma.

448
00:27:08,068 --> 00:27:09,388
I don't want to go to the temple.

449
00:27:09,533 --> 00:27:11,003
I can't leave the Luo Residence.

450
00:27:11,131 --> 00:27:13,160
I can't leave my father and you.

451
00:27:14,603 --> 00:27:16,095
But what have you done

452
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:17,840
at your age?

453
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:20,000
You are scheming too much.

454
00:27:20,291 --> 00:27:21,560
Do you

455
00:27:21,855 --> 00:27:23,680
want to mess up the Luo Residence

456
00:27:23,939 --> 00:27:25,360
and cause chaos to it?

457
00:27:25,441 --> 00:27:26,320
No.

458
00:27:26,501 --> 00:27:28,095
I didn't expect

459
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,577
it would turn out to be this serious.

460
00:27:30,604 --> 00:27:32,003
I didn't do it on purpose.

461
00:27:32,084 --> 00:27:32,964
I know my mistake.

462
00:27:33,044 --> 00:27:34,280
I will never do it again.

463
00:27:34,964 --> 00:27:36,284
I can't go to the temple.

464
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:37,240
If I go,

465
00:27:37,321 --> 00:27:38,680
what will happen to Xuan?

466
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,640
Xuan cannot be away from me.

467
00:27:40,775 --> 00:27:42,325
Xuan will go to study

468
00:27:42,405 --> 00:27:44,160
at the academy in a few days.

469
00:27:44,386 --> 00:27:45,186
In the future,

470
00:27:45,605 --> 00:27:47,120
when he has improved

471
00:27:47,472 --> 00:27:49,040
and you have reflected on your mistakes,

472
00:27:49,298 --> 00:27:51,000
I will bring both of you back.

473
00:27:51,345 --> 00:27:52,145
After all,

474
00:27:52,986 --> 00:27:55,440
all of you are descendants
of the Luo family.

475
00:28:02,606 --> 00:28:03,560
Go.

476
00:28:06,712 --> 00:28:08,920
Yes, Grandma.

477
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,560
(Haitang Abode)

478
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,080
(Good Reputations Spread)

479
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,569
(Haitang Abode)

480
00:28:44,649 --> 00:28:45,490
Sixth Sister.

481
00:28:46,167 --> 00:28:47,087
Seventh Sister.

482
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:48,829
Sorry.

483
00:28:49,405 --> 00:28:50,525
Actually, I should ask Mother

484
00:28:50,605 --> 00:28:51,970
to apologize to you.

485
00:28:52,103 --> 00:28:53,600
But I'm apologizing to you on her behalf

486
00:28:53,755 --> 00:28:55,160
as her daughter.

487
00:28:55,556 --> 00:28:56,357
Sixth Sister,

488
00:28:57,324 --> 00:28:58,365
don't say this.

489
00:28:58,642 --> 00:28:59,800
I only hope

490
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,136
this incident can pass quickly.

491
00:29:01,341 --> 00:29:02,901
I made you suffer as well.

492
00:29:03,755 --> 00:29:04,715
No matter what,

493
00:29:04,947 --> 00:29:06,724
you will always be my Sixth Sister.

494
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:13,322
Uncle.

495
00:29:19,197 --> 00:29:20,357
I was the culprit

496
00:29:21,668 --> 00:29:23,298
for what happened.

497
00:29:25,084 --> 00:29:26,244
If it wasn't for me,

498
00:29:27,365 --> 00:29:28,290
your Aunt

499
00:29:29,315 --> 00:29:30,880
wouldn't have done this.

500
00:29:33,483 --> 00:29:36,003
Your mother wouldn't...

501
00:29:37,373 --> 00:29:40,197
Thankfully, you are enlightened now.

502
00:29:42,925 --> 00:29:44,605
When you got married,

503
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,876
you were supposed to be loyal

504
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,420
and let go of your past relationships.

505
00:29:51,092 --> 00:29:52,258
You've also

506
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,681
let Aunt down by doing this.

507
00:29:55,536 --> 00:29:56,910
I was confused for most of my life

508
00:29:58,646 --> 00:30:00,025
and harmed both others and myself.

509
00:30:04,916 --> 00:30:05,716
Yining,

510
00:30:06,965 --> 00:30:08,478
I have decided to leave the capital

511
00:30:09,244 --> 00:30:10,880
and become an official in a county.

512
00:30:11,379 --> 00:30:12,290
In the future,

513
00:30:13,664 --> 00:30:15,040
I won't come back for no reason.

514
00:30:17,236 --> 00:30:18,251

Young Lady, are you reluctant
to leave Luo Residence?

00:33:37,968 --> 00:33:40,192
I think she is reluctant
to leave Third Young Master.

549
00:33:42,484 --> 00:33:44,505
Young Lady, why didn't you allow him

550
00:33:44,586 --> 00:33:45,800
to send you off just now?

551
00:33:47,601 --> 00:33:49,960
I am no longer siblings with him
in the future.

552
00:33:50,226 --> 00:33:51,440
Both of you must be careful

553
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,680
when you speak.

554
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,440
However, I realize Third Young Master

555
00:33:55,524 --> 00:33:57,320
isn't trying to avoid you.

556
00:33:59,285 --> 00:34:00,726
It still feels different.

557
00:34:06,618 --> 00:34:07,459

- Hairu, that day...
- I know.

562
00:34:25,995 --> 00:34:27,445
You got agitated

563
00:34:27,835 --> 00:34:28,773
because of Yining.

564
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:36,570
Keep reading.

565
00:34:37,376 --> 00:34:38,640
Take a break if you are tired.

00:34:39,004 --> 00:34:40,845
Tell me if you want to eat anything.

567
00:34:42,084 --> 00:34:43,560
You had Yining to help you in the past.

568
00:34:44,164 --> 00:34:45,445
Right now, you are busy

569
00:34:45,876 --> 00:34:47,195
managing the whole residence.

570
00:34:47,587 --> 00:34:49,868
If you want to find a helper,
just do it.

571
00:34:50,276 --> 00:34:51,276
Don't tire yourself.

572
00:34:51,365 --> 00:34:52,165
Don't worry.

573
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,624
I won't treat myself badly.

574
00:35:15,339 --> 00:35:16,139
I'm leaving.

575
00:35:19,201 --> 00:35:20,042
Hairu.

576
00:35:25,626 --> 00:35:26,426
Hairu.

577
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:35,540
Thank you.

578
00:35:41,819 --> 00:35:43,080
It's just a bowl of Ginseng Soup.

579
00:35:43,536 --> 00:35:44,880
I wasn't even the one who boiled it.

580
00:35:46,004 --> 00:35:46,960
Why are you thanking me?

581
00:36:16,538 --> 00:36:18,040
You brought men to trespass

582
00:36:18,924 --> 00:36:20,880
on another person's
residence in broad daylight!

583
00:36:21,202 --> 00:36:23,684
News has spread all over the capital!

584
00:36:23,779 --> 00:36:24,804
It's ridiculous!

585
00:36:28,882 --> 00:36:30,480
(Old Madam Wei)
Mother, it's all my fault

586
00:36:30,717 --> 00:36:32,840
for making my own daughter
suffer so much.

587
00:36:33,124 --> 00:36:35,160
Right now,
her mother is no longer alive.

588
00:36:35,216 --> 00:36:37,160
I should be taking care of her
and protecting her.

589
00:36:37,245 --> 00:36:38,765
So, I couldn't care so much.

590
00:36:38,846 --> 00:36:39,726
You were reckless.

591
00:36:41,003 --> 00:36:42,480
How can you be sure

592
00:36:42,627 --> 00:36:43,443
that Seventh Lady

593
00:36:43,524 --> 00:36:45,120
is your daughter?

594
00:36:46,452 --> 00:36:48,611
She has been silent all these years

595
00:36:48,932 --> 00:36:51,160
but she suddenly appeared.

596
00:36:51,587 --> 00:36:52,640
Don't you believe me

597
00:36:53,403 --> 00:36:54,800
about this?

598
00:36:55,675 --> 00:36:57,876
I've let Minglan down

599
00:36:58,556 --> 00:36:59,920
and owe her an explanation.

600
00:37:07,548 --> 00:37:09,765
You haven't gotten a wife
for so many years

601
00:37:11,484 --> 00:37:13,405
because of Minglan?

602
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,520
Mingzhu, you are here.

603
00:37:26,553 --> 00:37:28,320
Grandma. Father.

604
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,550
Grandma.

605
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,119
Grandma, calm down.

606
00:37:41,428 --> 00:37:42,520
Take care of your health.

607
00:37:43,264 --> 00:37:45,000
Mingzhu,
you are the most sensible person.

608
00:37:48,146 --> 00:37:48,987
You.

609
00:37:50,323 --> 00:37:51,602
What are you planning next?

610
00:37:52,901 --> 00:37:54,726
I just want to make up for her.

611
00:37:58,226 --> 00:37:59,026
Whatever.

612
00:37:59,562 --> 00:38:00,625
Another child

613
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,080
will only make the place livelier.

614
00:38:02,515 --> 00:38:03,515
Invite her

615
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,160
to return after a few days

616
00:38:05,532 --> 00:38:06,668
so other people

617
00:38:06,749 --> 00:38:08,325
don't say that we are stingy.

618
00:38:11,172 --> 00:38:12,853
She is still

619
00:38:13,603 --> 00:38:14,723
living outside for now.

620
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,720
It was sudden
for her background to come to light.

621
00:38:17,804 --> 00:38:19,643
She needs some time to accept it.

622
00:38:20,187 --> 00:38:21,308
What do you mean?

623
00:38:22,156 --> 00:38:23,596
She doesn't want to come back?

624
00:38:23,794 --> 00:38:26,273
Does she feel aggrieved
to become the legitimate daughter

625
00:38:26,405 --> 00:38:27,617
of Duke Ying's Residence?

626
00:38:27,698 --> 00:38:28,498
No.

627
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:29,640
Mother, calm down.

628
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,940
Put yourself in her shoes.

629
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:34,240
Even if this happens to anyone,

630
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:35,805
she should...

631
00:38:35,885 --> 00:38:37,725
She should still have some time

632
00:38:37,923 --> 00:38:39,042
to accept it.

633
00:38:39,444 --> 00:38:40,644
Grandma and Father

634
00:38:40,725 --> 00:38:42,240
are being so considerate to her.

635
00:38:42,564 --> 00:38:43,365
Don't tell me

636
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,992
that she's not willing
to accept the offer.

637
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:45,750
Mingzhu.

638
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,015
Whether Yining comes
to stay here or not,

639
00:38:48,032 --> 00:38:49,580
she will still be Duke Ying Residence's

640
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:51,190
legitimate daughter
and your elder sister.

641
00:38:51,878 --> 00:38:52,760
I know.

642
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,321
That's enough.

643
00:38:55,013 --> 00:38:57,133
Why are you shouting at Mingzhu?

644
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,720
Isn't your legitimate daughter

645
00:38:58,795 --> 00:39:00,280
not here after all?

646
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:02,765
I'm sure you will like her
when she's here.

647
00:39:04,245 --> 00:39:05,045
Forget it.

648
00:39:05,484 --> 00:39:06,434
Since you've determined

649
00:39:06,515 --> 00:39:07,955
her to be your daughter,

650
00:39:08,244 --> 00:39:10,003
go and comfort her

651
00:39:10,146 --> 00:39:11,600
and bring her back after two days.

652
00:39:12,218 --> 00:39:14,259
She mustn't be too pampered.

653
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,875
Have you agreed to it?

654
00:39:24,205 --> 00:39:25,164
Thank you, Mother.

655
00:39:27,285 --> 00:39:28,085
I...

656
00:39:41,552 --> 00:39:42,900
I haven't seen Father this happy

657
00:39:42,987 --> 00:39:44,040
for a long time.

658
00:39:44,725 --> 00:39:45,525
Mingzhu.

659
00:39:48,524 --> 00:39:49,405
Mingzhu.

660
00:39:52,811 --> 00:39:53,611
Grandma.

661
00:39:56,015 --> 00:39:57,680
Are you feeling upset

662
00:39:58,012 --> 00:39:59,120
because

663
00:39:59,301 --> 00:40:01,320
Yining is coming back?

664
00:40:01,681 --> 00:40:03,040
I can't hide this from you, Grandma.

665
00:40:03,819 --> 00:40:05,040
I do feel

666
00:40:05,327 --> 00:40:06,600
a little upset.

667
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:08,659
Will you not like me anymore

668
00:40:08,885 --> 00:40:10,204
when she comes back?

669
00:40:10,524 --> 00:40:12,492
Now that Father has found his daughter,

670
00:40:12,691 --> 00:40:14,372
he will send me back to Zhao Residence.

671
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:18,640
What kind of nonsense

672
00:40:18,721 --> 00:40:20,781
are you thinking about?

673
00:40:21,187 --> 00:40:23,480
Of course, I like you the most

674
00:40:23,687 --> 00:40:24,523
because

675
00:40:24,604 --> 00:40:27,524
I raised you myself.

676
00:40:33,325 --> 00:40:35,325
I know you love me the most.

677
00:40:35,515 --> 00:40:36,640
You were always by my side

678
00:40:36,787 --> 00:40:38,320
when I fell ill at a young age.

679
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:40,320
You couldn't even sleep every night.

680
00:40:41,941 --> 00:40:43,560
As long as you understand.

681
00:40:43,918 --> 00:40:46,249
Don't worry.

682
00:40:46,624 --> 00:40:48,840
I brought you here from the Zhao family.

683
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:51,331
I won't send you back.

684
00:40:53,019 --> 00:40:54,340
I'm relieved

685
00:40:54,684 --> 00:40:55,749
to hear you say that.

686
00:40:56,521 --> 00:40:57,440
Grandma.

687
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:01,440
(Splendors of Nature
and Treasures of Heaven)

688
00:41:10,445 --> 00:41:12,281
Didn't you say you were experienced?

689
00:41:12,304 --> 00:41:13,450
There will be many customers

690
00:41:13,539 --> 00:41:14,819
as long as the products are good.

691
00:41:15,971 --> 00:41:17,371
It's the opening of a new shop.

692
00:41:18,211 --> 00:41:19,252
It is understandable

693
00:41:19,563 --> 00:41:20,680
to have fewer customers.

694
00:41:20,736 --> 00:41:22,000
How is this having fewer customers?

695
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,472
This is having no customers at all.

696
00:41:28,304 --> 00:41:29,692
They say doing business

697
00:41:29,773 --> 00:41:31,080
is about reputation.

698
00:41:31,303 --> 00:41:32,343
The wealthiest people

699
00:41:32,424 --> 00:41:34,160
are the noble ladies of the capital.

700
00:41:34,623 --> 00:41:36,543
How do we attract them?

701
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:44,640
Manager!

702
00:41:50,015 --> 00:41:50,815
Both of you.

703
00:41:51,744 --> 00:41:52,544
Good.

704
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,440
Let's go.

705
00:41:53,518 --> 00:41:54,318
Go and welcome them.

706
00:41:57,749 --> 00:41:58,669
Please take a look here.

707
00:41:59,174 --> 00:41:59,974
This way, please.

708
00:42:00,631 --> 00:42:02,463
What aroma do you usually like?

709
00:42:02,544 --> 00:42:03,584
I like a light fragrance.

710
00:42:04,118 --> 00:42:04,999
Try this.

711
00:42:09,376 --> 00:42:10,176
Let me try it.

712
00:42:10,984 --> 00:42:13,344
This is exclusive to our shop.

713
00:42:29,264 --> 00:42:31,720
I heard Duke Ying has recognized you

714
00:42:32,077 --> 00:42:33,400
but you wouldn't return.

715
00:42:34,250 --> 00:42:36,480
This has nothing to do with you,
Marquis.

716
00:42:39,896 --> 00:42:40,920
Did you

717
00:42:41,001 --> 00:42:42,280
invite all the people out there?

718
00:42:43,863 --> 00:42:45,080
You are opening a shop.

719
00:42:45,734 --> 00:42:46,560
What you sell

720
00:42:46,641 --> 00:42:47,880
is what they need.

721
00:42:48,265 --> 00:42:49,968
I'm just introducing them here

722
00:42:50,016 --> 00:42:51,400
and letting them come to shop once.

723
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:53,240
This is beneficial

724
00:42:53,645 --> 00:42:54,800
for both you and them.

725
00:42:55,511 --> 00:42:56,800
There's no need to worry about it.

726
00:42:58,464 --> 00:43:00,064
I appreciate your kindness.

727
00:43:00,513 --> 00:43:01,834
Please don't meddle in my business

728
00:43:01,999 --> 00:43:03,279
after you leave.

729
00:43:04,854 --> 00:43:05,654
Mei.

730
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:09,131
I, Lu Jiaxue,

731
00:43:09,648 --> 00:43:11,360
will never do anything that harms you.

732
00:43:13,054 --> 00:43:14,333
I told you

733
00:43:14,414 --> 00:43:15,680
I was not Mei.

734
00:43:16,117 --> 00:43:17,840
Stop meddling with my life.

735
00:43:18,055 --> 00:43:18,855
Also,

736
00:43:19,737 --> 00:43:20,657
my shop

737
00:43:20,743 --> 00:43:22,720
received many pearls and agates.

738
00:43:23,274 --> 00:43:24,640
I don't know who sent them

739
00:43:24,832 --> 00:43:26,704
and I delivered them to the officials.
