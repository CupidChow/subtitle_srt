Training Handbook" from Jinjiang Literature)

=Episode 5=

4
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,640
(Haitang Abode)

5
00:01:45,744 --> 00:01:46,664
Ms. Li.

6
00:01:49,403 --> 00:01:50,203
Seventh Lady.

7
00:01:50,817 --> 00:01:51,618
Ms. Li.

8
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,360
Since you are diligent and elderly,

9
00:01:54,385 --> 00:01:55,586
our Young Lady brought you here

10
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:57,743
so that you don't have
to suffer with the rest.

11
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,721
Thank you, Seventh Lady.

12
00:02:00,932 --> 00:02:03,691
I will do my best to serve you.

13
00:02:04,313 --> 00:02:05,953
Okay. You may leave now.

14
00:02:06,284 --> 00:02:07,043
Yes, Seventh Lady.

15
00:02:13,494 --> 00:02:15,654
Ms. Li is new here.

16
00:02:15,774 --> 00:02:17,774
I'm sure Mistress Qiao will be wary.

17
00:02:18,575 --> 00:02:21,135
We'll let her leave in peace
for a few days.

18
00:02:21,255 --> 00:02:22,535
We'll take it

19
00:02:22,695 --> 00:02:24,054
one step at a time.

20
00:02:25,494 --> 00:02:26,295
Yes, Seventh Lady.

21
00:02:27,494 --> 00:02:29,295
Let's treat her better for now.

22
00:02:30,175 --> 00:02:30,894
Yes, Seventh Lady.

23
00:02:34,103 --> 00:02:36,009
(Danhua Abode)

24
00:02:42,975 --> 00:02:43,934
Why did she

25
00:02:44,023 --> 00:02:45,464
enter the kitchen again?

26
00:03:00,094 --> 00:03:02,094
Mother, why are you here?

27
00:03:03,334 --> 00:03:04,334
You should just leave this

28
00:03:04,455 --> 00:03:06,695
to the kitchen maids.

29
00:03:06,774 --> 00:03:07,975
You are the one

30
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:10,329
who asked me to move more

31
00:03:10,354 --> 00:03:11,794
and be more active.

32
00:03:12,975 --> 00:03:16,135
If only you were
as obedient as your sister.

33
00:03:16,735 --> 00:03:17,575
Ms. Zhao.

34
00:03:17,934 --> 00:03:18,575
Yes, Madam Chen.

35
00:03:22,654 --> 00:03:23,575
Sixth Lady.

36
00:03:38,688 --> 00:03:40,304
The circumference
of her waist is 2.2 chi.

37
00:03:41,654 --> 00:03:43,094
It has been so many days.

38
00:03:44,175 --> 00:03:46,175
Why hasn't she slimmed down?

39
00:03:46,855 --> 00:03:47,814
From today onward,

40
00:03:47,878 --> 00:03:50,239
cut off the snacks
from the Sixth Lady's diet.

41
00:03:50,409 --> 00:03:51,088
Yes.

42
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,330
Mother. You've cut off meat
from my diet.

43
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,040
How can I live without snacks?

44
00:03:55,072 --> 00:03:56,495
You are a lady.

45
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,281
If you don't
take good care of your weight,

46
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,224
how can you marry into
a good family in the future?

47
00:04:02,494 --> 00:04:03,535
When you can cut off

48
00:04:03,567 --> 00:04:05,447
two inches from your waist,

49
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,928
you can go back to your original diet.

50
00:04:07,214 --> 00:04:08,735
Two inches?

51
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,280
Moreover,

52
00:04:10,767 --> 00:04:12,808
after lunch and dinner,

53
00:04:12,857 --> 00:04:14,376
you have to take a walk in the yard.

54
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:16,775
Do not come back
until you've walked two hours.

55
00:04:17,735 --> 00:04:18,614
One more thing.

56
00:04:18,694 --> 00:04:20,975
Do not enter the kitchen ever again.

57
00:04:21,614 --> 00:04:23,335
Sixth Lady, let's go.

58
00:04:48,574 --> 00:04:51,494
Why was he obsessed
with these calligraphic paintings?

59
00:04:53,134 --> 00:04:54,014
Yining.

60
00:04:55,134 --> 00:04:56,134
Sixth Sister.

61
00:04:57,374 --> 00:04:58,295
Help me.

62
00:04:59,454 --> 00:05:00,215
Sixth Lady.

63
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:02,735
It's so heavy.

64
00:05:03,254 --> 00:05:04,175
Sixth Sister.

65
00:05:04,454 --> 00:05:06,614
What did you bring me?

66
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,690
After thinking long and hard
about it, I think

67
00:05:08,719 --> 00:05:10,171
it's best for me to keep this here.

68
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,199
My mother forbade me
from entering the kitchen.

69
00:05:12,454 --> 00:05:15,614
These spices and seasonings have
been in my collection for a long time.

70
00:05:15,664 --> 00:05:16,224
Look.

71
00:05:16,535 --> 00:05:17,494
Sixth Sister.

72
00:05:17,614 --> 00:05:19,574
You are really a unique lady.

73
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,881
Other ladies

74
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,841
collect cosmetic products

75
00:05:22,912 --> 00:05:24,895
but you collect food seasonings.

76
00:05:24,952 --> 00:05:26,873
Stop teasing me.

77
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,440
My mother has forced me to be on a diet.

78
00:05:29,775 --> 00:05:32,895
What's the point of living
if I can't eat?

79
00:05:33,975 --> 00:05:35,335
Actually, if you are healthy,

80
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:36,896
there's nothing wrong with being plump.

81
00:05:37,095 --> 00:05:39,535
Beauty comes in all shapes and sizes.

82
00:05:39,735 --> 00:05:43,215
It's their fault for being
too strict on us ladies.

83
00:05:46,574 --> 00:05:48,374
Why are you looking at me like that?

84
00:05:49,335 --> 00:05:52,095
I just think that you are different
from how you were

85
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,159
when you were young.

86
00:05:53,494 --> 00:05:54,734
In the past,

87
00:05:54,775 --> 00:05:56,729
you were so fierce and tough.

88
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:58,560
Especially when it came
to bullying Luo Shenyuan.

89
00:05:58,592 --> 00:05:59,984
You were fiercer than Fourth Brother.

90
00:06:01,735 --> 00:06:02,934
I don't remember.

91
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:04,478
I heard it from the servants.

92
00:06:04,574 --> 00:06:06,400
They said that he found
a one-in-a-kind book before this.

93
00:06:06,494 --> 00:06:08,134
But you tore it up and used the pages

94
00:06:08,215 --> 00:06:09,494
to make paper cranes with.

95
00:06:09,855 --> 00:06:11,254
Then there was a jujube tree.

96
00:06:11,374 --> 00:06:13,374
You said that you wanted
to eat the jujube

97
00:06:13,392 --> 00:06:15,568
and asked him to pick them for you.
The tree was very tall.

98
00:06:15,655 --> 00:06:16,694
In the end, he fell down

99
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,272
from the tree
trying to get the jujubes.

100
00:06:18,934 --> 00:06:21,574
He fell down from the jujube tree?

101
00:06:23,254 --> 00:06:25,735
I want the red one. Hurry up.

102
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:27,041
Climb up higher.

103
00:06:27,295 --> 00:06:28,694
Are you that weak?

104
00:06:29,454 --> 00:06:30,374
Hurry up.

105
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,680
I'll reach it soon.

106
00:06:31,768 --> 00:06:33,814
I want the ripest one
at the top of the branch.

107
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:35,159
Climb up higher.

108
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,000
Okay.

109
00:06:37,014 --> 00:06:38,134
I want that one.

110
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:39,800
Climb up higher.

111
00:06:40,975 --> 00:06:42,095
I got it!

112
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:44,054
You got it so easily.

113
00:06:44,175 --> 00:06:46,614
I don't want to eat it anymore.
I'm going for a walk.

114
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,800
Third Brother.

115
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:55,670
Third Brother.

116
00:06:57,655 --> 00:06:59,934
Young Lady.

117
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:06,855
You are so kind.

118
00:07:06,934 --> 00:07:08,335
You reminded Madam Lin

119
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:10,528
to give Third Young Master
his monthly allowance and coals.

120
00:07:10,592 --> 00:07:12,080
You are even giving him some gifts.

121
00:07:12,494 --> 00:07:13,855
Everyone in the residence knows

122
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,488
Second Master
dislikes Third Young Master.

123
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:16,934
They call him Young Master,

124
00:07:17,014 --> 00:07:19,655
but all of them look down on him.

125
00:07:20,014 --> 00:07:22,374
That's how it is in a residence
full of power play.

126
00:07:22,494 --> 00:07:23,814
I'm helping him now

127
00:07:23,839 --> 00:07:25,638
because he once helped me before.

128
00:07:26,014 --> 00:07:28,775
Besides, I owe him.

129
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,542
(Jimo House)

130
00:07:32,215 --> 00:07:33,134
Third Brother.

131
00:07:36,934 --> 00:07:37,655
Yining.

132
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:41,494
What are you doing?

133
00:07:41,934 --> 00:07:43,494
Recently, I've been cleaning out

134
00:07:43,519 --> 00:07:44,800
Mother's storeroom.

135
00:07:45,095 --> 00:07:47,014
And I think these things
can be of use to you.

136
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,359
So, I brought them here.

137
00:07:48,896 --> 00:07:50,752
There are brushes and inks
in this chest.

138
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,240
These were used by Madam Gu

139
00:07:57,265 --> 00:07:58,866
when she was still alive.

140
00:07:59,134 --> 00:08:01,014
Why don't you keep them for yourself?

141
00:08:01,655 --> 00:08:03,775
How do you know?

142
00:08:05,535 --> 00:08:08,215
Not long after I was born,
my mother passed away.

143
00:08:08,415 --> 00:08:10,374
Madam Gu took good care of me.

144
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:12,494
She even raised me at Minglan Hall.

145
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:14,640
After she moved to the side yard,

146
00:08:15,295 --> 00:08:17,254
I often went to Minglan Hall
to clean up the place.

147
00:08:17,454 --> 00:08:19,254
I hoped that it would
stay clean and warm

148
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:21,039
just like it did
when she was still alive.

149
00:08:25,694 --> 00:08:26,814
Unfortunately,

150
00:08:27,054 --> 00:08:30,095
these things are just
left collecting dust now.

151
00:08:31,175 --> 00:08:32,655
But I've kept

152
00:08:32,701 --> 00:08:34,181
many of her belongings.

153
00:08:34,415 --> 00:08:35,655
The brushes look high-quality.

154
00:08:35,814 --> 00:08:38,255
So, I wanted to give them to you
for you to paint with.

155
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:42,719
By the way,

156
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,960
I've brought other things for you.

157
00:08:47,895 --> 00:08:50,295
Our Grandpa's paintings
are in this chest.

158
00:08:50,368 --> 00:08:52,368
Before this, you said
that you wanted to study them.

159
00:08:52,415 --> 00:08:53,814
So, I brought it here.

160
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:55,454
I hope it can help.

161
00:08:58,615 --> 00:09:01,375
I've indeed admired our Grandpa's
paintings for a long time.

162
00:09:01,655 --> 00:09:02,895
Thank you for giving it to me.

163
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:04,090
I'll study it well and return it

164
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,328
to you as soon as possible.

165
00:09:06,015 --> 00:09:07,415
I will go back now.

166
00:09:07,574 --> 00:09:09,214
If you need anything,

167
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,310
you can ask Shao'an to contact Qing Qu.

168
00:09:11,574 --> 00:09:12,135
Okay.

169
00:09:12,224 --> 00:09:13,160
Please wait for a moment.

170
00:09:25,574 --> 00:09:26,775
You can keep this as a memento.

171
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,940
(Lan)

172
00:09:32,334 --> 00:09:34,094
This is my mother's hairpin.

173
00:09:34,135 --> 00:09:36,135
I went to Minglan Hall
before it was torn down.

174
00:09:36,535 --> 00:09:38,655
(Minglan Hall)
(I saw them moving out many things.)

175
00:09:38,814 --> 00:09:39,734
(Unfortunately,)

176
00:09:40,054 --> 00:09:41,574
(I only managed to take this.)

177
00:09:42,934 --> 00:09:44,175
Be quick.

178
00:09:44,775 --> 00:09:45,974
What are you looking at?

179
00:09:46,175 --> 00:09:47,775
Is this a place where you should come?

180
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,039
Leave at once.

181
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,959
These are Madam Gu's things.

182
00:09:54,995 --> 00:09:56,535
It has nothing to do with you. Leave.

183
00:10:00,454 --> 00:10:01,775
It wasn't easy for you.

184
00:10:02,054 --> 00:10:04,615
You were still a child at that time.

185
00:10:09,135 --> 00:10:10,615
Thank you, Third Brother.

186
00:10:12,495 --> 00:10:14,054
You don't have to see me out.

187
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:15,934
I'll wait for you to create

188
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,232
your own painting in the future.

189
00:10:17,312 --> 00:10:18,450
After I study the paintings,

190
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,920
I will return Grandpa's paintings to you

191
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:20,864
and send my own painting

192
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,630
to Haitang Abode.

193
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:23,974
Please give me
some constructive critiques then.

194
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,135
Father.

195
00:10:27,734 --> 00:10:28,375
Father.

196
00:10:28,574 --> 00:10:29,895
Just now, I heard you talking

197
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,375
about your Grandpa's paintings.

198
00:10:31,744 --> 00:10:33,250
I gave our Grandpa's
paintings to him

199
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,639
as a gift.

200
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,400
Who gave you the permission to do that?

201
00:10:36,752 --> 00:10:38,570
How could you give
the paintings to someone else?

202
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:40,390
Third Brother is a descendant
of the Luo family.

203
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,660
He admires our Grandpa's paintings.

204
00:10:41,665 --> 00:10:42,545
What's the issue

205
00:10:42,814 --> 00:10:44,175
of letting him study his paintings?

206
00:10:45,415 --> 00:10:46,334
Butler Bai.

207
00:10:47,054 --> 00:10:48,094
Take the paintings away.

208
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:48,800
Yes, Master.

209
00:10:49,175 --> 00:10:49,974
Wait.

210
00:10:51,094 --> 00:10:51,854
Father.

211
00:10:52,054 --> 00:10:53,974
Those paintings are from Grandma.

212
00:10:53,999 --> 00:10:56,214
Even you can't take them away from me.

213
00:10:56,296 --> 00:10:57,135
Luo Yining.

214
00:10:57,495 --> 00:10:59,295
Mind your words.

215
00:10:59,328 --> 00:11:02,128
Don't think I won't punish you because
you have your grandma's protection.

216
00:11:02,694 --> 00:11:04,334
Why are you standing there? Go.

217
00:11:04,535 --> 00:11:05,094
Yes.

218
00:11:05,574 --> 00:11:06,255
Father.

219
00:11:06,574 --> 00:11:07,895
This has nothing to do with Yining.

220
00:11:08,033 --> 00:11:09,975
She lent it to me because
I kept asking her for it.

221
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,655
- Shut up.
- This is unfair.

222
00:11:11,734 --> 00:11:12,495
I can't accept it.

223
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,119
I am the master of the Luo family.

224
00:11:14,164 --> 00:11:15,244
Are you going to disobey me?

225
00:11:15,495 --> 00:11:16,214
Father.

226
00:11:16,495 --> 00:11:19,214
This has nothing to do with Yining.

227
00:11:19,334 --> 00:11:21,214
It's my fault.

228
00:11:21,295 --> 00:11:22,054
Second Master.

229
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,295
Censor Liu

230
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,826
is still waiting for you
at Liuhe Tavern.

231
00:11:28,734 --> 00:11:30,454
How unfortunate our family is.

232
00:11:32,415 --> 00:11:33,895
Seventh Lady, I'll

233
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,201
keep these paintings safe for you.

234
00:11:35,334 --> 00:11:36,535
Don't be mad.

235
00:11:36,655 --> 00:11:37,615
Second Master

236
00:11:38,202 --> 00:11:39,562
is in a fit of anger now.

237
00:11:40,375 --> 00:11:41,694
Thank you, Butler Bai.

238
00:11:49,535 --> 00:11:51,094
Second Master was terrible.

239
00:11:51,255 --> 00:11:52,974
How could he treat you
like that in public?

240
00:11:53,814 --> 00:11:54,734
I'm used to it.

241
00:11:55,094 --> 00:11:57,295
For him, I don't exist.

242
00:11:57,775 --> 00:11:59,054
We finally got the painting.

243
00:11:59,079 --> 00:12:00,358
But we lost it again.

244
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,960
If someone from Haitang Abode
visits us again,

245
00:12:03,008 --> 00:12:04,080
tell them that I'm not in.

246
00:12:04,295 --> 00:12:05,574
If they want to give me presents,

247
00:12:05,895 --> 00:12:07,094
reject them for me.

248
00:12:07,119 --> 00:12:07,800
Why?

249
00:12:08,015 --> 00:12:09,854
You saw what happened today.

250
00:12:10,224 --> 00:12:12,050
I don't want to cause trouble
for others again.

251
00:12:13,135 --> 00:12:14,334
I understand, Young Master.

252
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:17,400
(Haitang Abode)

253
00:12:23,615 --> 00:12:24,334
Young Lady,

254
00:12:25,655 --> 00:12:26,775
don't take

255
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,280
what Second Master said to heart.

256
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:29,775
Don't punish yourself.

257
00:12:30,135 --> 00:12:32,334
I don't care about what he said.

258
00:12:32,934 --> 00:12:34,775
But Third Brother got humiliated

259
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,800
because of me today.

260
00:12:36,135 --> 00:12:37,895
I should apologize to him.

261
00:12:38,135 --> 00:12:40,574
Young Lady, Second Master
is still in a fit of anger.

262
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:42,775
How about we keep our distance

263
00:12:42,854 --> 00:12:44,015
from Jimo House for now?

264
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,639
Don't make
Second Master angry again.

265
00:12:45,744 --> 00:12:47,450
Third Brother and I
didn't do anything wrong.

266
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:49,584
My father is the one who has
a wrong sense of judgment.

267
00:12:49,664 --> 00:12:51,290
He has a prejudice
against Third Brother.

268
00:12:52,694 --> 00:12:53,854
I won't change my principles

269
00:12:53,879 --> 00:12:55,400
because of him.

270
00:12:55,425 --> 00:12:57,574
Don't say something
like that ever again.

271
00:12:57,775 --> 00:12:59,974
Yes, Young Lady. I said the wrong thing.

272
00:13:01,135 --> 00:13:02,334
How's Ms. Li

273
00:13:02,359 --> 00:13:03,359
lately?

274
00:13:03,694 --> 00:13:06,295
She cleans the yard every day.
When she talks,

275
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,560
she does it politely.

276
00:13:07,814 --> 00:13:09,974
She looks like an honest woman.

277
00:13:10,175 --> 00:13:12,615
We have kept her here all these days.

278
00:13:13,694 --> 00:13:15,255
But Bi Yi came here three times

279
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,800
and peeked from outside.

280
00:13:18,054 --> 00:13:18,934
Looks like

281
00:13:18,968 --> 00:13:20,888
Concubine Qiao is getting anxious.

282
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,690
I've checked all the physicians
in the capital

283
00:13:22,704 --> 00:13:23,830
of similar age.

284
00:13:24,334 --> 00:13:27,054
But no physician named Chen
has ever entered Luo's Residence.

285
00:13:27,214 --> 00:13:29,615
We have a family physician,
Physician Li,

286
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:31,200
who has been serving us for eight years.

287
00:13:31,615 --> 00:13:33,734
Physician Chen
who was called upon in a short time

288
00:13:34,135 --> 00:13:36,295
was not a physician from the capital.

289
00:13:37,934 --> 00:13:40,295
Has Physician Chen left the capital

290
00:13:40,415 --> 00:13:41,615
or

291
00:13:41,775 --> 00:13:43,655
has this person never existed?

292
00:13:47,454 --> 00:13:49,495
Ms. Li has been locked in for too long.

293
00:13:49,854 --> 00:13:52,295
It's time to let her go out for a walk.

294
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:58,190
The paintings I gave Yining

295
00:13:58,934 --> 00:14:01,175
were taken away from Second Master?

296
00:14:01,615 --> 00:14:04,295
According to Butler Bai,
it was because Seventh Lady

297
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:07,734
lent Old Master's paintings
to Third Young Master.

298
00:14:07,895 --> 00:14:10,135
When Second Master found out,
he was furious.

299
00:14:10,368 --> 00:14:12,168
So, he confiscated the paintings.

300
00:14:16,135 --> 00:14:17,655
Shenyuan?

301
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:33,281
Why did he want to borrow the paintings?

302
00:14:33,775 --> 00:14:36,094
It must be because he admires them.

303
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,615
Back then, Old Master's paintings

304
00:14:38,734 --> 00:14:40,655
were divine.

305
00:14:40,934 --> 00:14:42,734
It's also said

306
00:14:42,854 --> 00:14:45,615
that Second Master
said something mean

307
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,168
to Seventh Lady and Third Young Master.

308
00:14:50,295 --> 00:14:52,833
I knew it. My son

309
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,201
only cares

310
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:58,359
about Concubine Qiao's child.

311
00:14:58,615 --> 00:14:59,574
See?

312
00:14:59,854 --> 00:15:01,454
When Yilian made a mistake,

313
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,360
he just hit her lightly on the palm

314
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:05,734
and that was it.

315
00:15:06,135 --> 00:15:08,535
He even tried so hard
to keep it a secret from me.

316
00:15:08,694 --> 00:15:09,814
I knew.

317
00:15:10,214 --> 00:15:13,495
He didn't want to let words spread

318
00:15:13,574 --> 00:15:16,655
and ruin Yilian's reputation.

319
00:15:17,295 --> 00:15:19,094
Thus,

320
00:15:20,015 --> 00:15:22,175
I know I need to make plans

321
00:15:22,694 --> 00:15:24,854
for Yining as soon as possible.

322
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:26,775
Up to this day,

323
00:15:26,809 --> 00:15:30,529
it's important to marry
into a prestigious family.

324
00:15:31,255 --> 00:15:34,375
But the most important thing
is to find someone

325
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,920
who truly loves her.

326
00:15:36,694 --> 00:15:37,615
Old Madam.

327
00:15:37,814 --> 00:15:39,615
Who do you have in mind?

328
00:15:44,974 --> 00:15:47,454
I'm still thinking about it.

329
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,300
(Haitang Abode)

330
00:15:57,054 --> 00:15:57,895
Xue Zhi.

331
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:01,214
This pot of Chinese peony
looks so lonely here

332
00:16:01,239 --> 00:16:02,280
all by itself.

333
00:16:02,558 --> 00:16:05,015
Bring a few more here.

334
00:16:05,295 --> 00:16:07,054
Yes, Young Lady. I'll do that now.

335
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,934
- Xue Zhi.
- Are you okay?

336
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,568
Are you okay?

337
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,440
Look at you.
Why didn't you watch your step?

338
00:16:15,775 --> 00:16:17,895
Bring Qing Qu here.

339
00:16:18,535 --> 00:16:20,054
It's okay. I'm fine.

340
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:21,680
Let me carry
the Chinese peony here first.

341
00:16:21,744 --> 00:16:23,730
If I'm late,
all the good ones will be gone.

342
00:16:24,495 --> 00:16:26,574
The most important thing now
is to treat your wound.

343
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,580
I can just ask others to get
the Chinese peony for me.

344
00:16:29,415 --> 00:16:30,295
Ms. Li.

345
00:16:31,734 --> 00:16:33,015
How about you help me with that?

346
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:34,495
Yes, Seventh Lady.

347
00:16:37,415 --> 00:16:39,734
Xue Zhi, come back and take a rest.

348
00:16:47,454 --> 00:16:48,295
Ms. Li.

349
00:16:56,976 --> 00:16:58,410
Concubine Qiao wants you to find a way

350
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,920
to leave Luo's Residence.

351
00:17:00,336 --> 00:17:01,610
She'll take care of everything

352
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,240
for you outside of the residence.

353
00:17:03,775 --> 00:17:04,934
Ms. Bi Yi.

354
00:17:05,855 --> 00:17:07,095
I already forgot

355
00:17:07,494 --> 00:17:09,415
what happened back then.

356
00:17:10,934 --> 00:17:13,920
I'm old and alone right now.

357
00:17:14,135 --> 00:17:16,095
I have nowhere to go.

358
00:17:17,895 --> 00:17:21,055
I just want to continue working
at Luo's Residence.

359
00:17:21,734 --> 00:17:23,294
When I die one day,

360
00:17:23,534 --> 00:17:24,655
at least

361
00:17:24,741 --> 00:17:26,941
I have someone who can give me a burial.

362
00:17:29,534 --> 00:17:30,415
Besides,

363
00:17:31,095 --> 00:17:33,415
Seventh Lady hasn't asked me anything.

364
00:17:33,694 --> 00:17:35,454
She was so young.

365
00:17:36,095 --> 00:17:37,734
She didn't know anything.

366
00:17:38,055 --> 00:17:39,254
After you leave the residence,

367
00:17:39,282 --> 00:17:40,842
Concubine Qiao will give you
enough money

368
00:17:41,014 --> 00:17:42,254
to last you until your retirement.

369
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:45,000
You'll even have enough money
to adopt a child.

370
00:17:46,692 --> 00:17:48,331
That's all I can say.

371
00:17:49,774 --> 00:17:51,294
You know what you should do.

372
00:18:12,895 --> 00:18:15,694
Ms. Li will probably resign soon.

373
00:18:15,742 --> 00:18:17,342
I haven't seen her for two days.

374
00:18:17,694 --> 00:18:19,649
That's right.
After coming back from the garden,

375
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:20,928
she started pretending to be ill.

376
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,090
Concubine Qiao must have
given her a way out.

377
00:18:24,055 --> 00:18:24,974
A way out.

378
00:18:25,175 --> 00:18:27,239
Young Lady, what should we do next?

379
00:18:27,454 --> 00:18:28,175
Xue Zhi.

380
00:18:28,734 --> 00:18:30,860
If she resigns from Mother,

381
00:18:30,885 --> 00:18:32,044
ask Mother to agree

382
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:33,294
as soon as possible.

383
00:18:33,534 --> 00:18:34,175
Yes, Young Lady.

384
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:48,464
Young Lady, you can't take a seat.

385
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,320
According to Madam Chen,
you have to walk two hours

386
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,320
after lunch every day.

387
00:18:51,534 --> 00:18:53,095
If others see you sitting here,

388
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,920
they'll report it
and you'll get punished.

389
00:18:55,494 --> 00:18:56,974
But I can't lose two inches

390
00:18:57,014 --> 00:18:59,254
from my waist. I can't walk anymore.

391
00:18:59,575 --> 00:19:02,694
Young Lady, please stand up, okay?

392
00:19:05,494 --> 00:19:06,454
A goose.

393
00:19:10,175 --> 00:19:11,934
This goose looks fat

394
00:19:11,959 --> 00:19:13,239
and juicy.

395
00:19:13,494 --> 00:19:14,694
It's well taken care of.

396
00:19:14,719 --> 00:19:15,479
You have great taste.

397
00:19:15,774 --> 00:19:17,335
My pet, Fu Gui is the most

398
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,960
handsome goose among other geese.

399
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,760
Well.

400
00:19:20,974 --> 00:19:22,934
Hand it over to Chef Cui

401
00:19:22,959 --> 00:19:24,118
and ask him

402
00:19:24,237 --> 00:19:25,717
to make the braised goose dish with it.

403
00:19:25,824 --> 00:19:26,185
Okay.

404
00:19:26,655 --> 00:19:27,895
It's my pet.

405
00:19:29,974 --> 00:19:30,855
Your pet?

406
00:19:31,335 --> 00:19:32,375
What about it?

407
00:19:32,655 --> 00:19:34,454
It's still a goose.

408
00:19:34,655 --> 00:19:35,575
Moreover,

409
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,360
you are a servant.

410
00:19:36,385 --> 00:19:37,945
Is this how you talk to your master?

411
00:19:38,214 --> 00:19:39,615
Who's whose servant?

412
00:19:39,734 --> 00:19:41,494
Where are you from, you fatty?

413
00:19:41,655 --> 00:19:43,346
Let me tell you. If you touch Fu Gui,

414
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,313
I won't forgive you.

415
00:19:44,534 --> 00:19:46,175
How dare you scold me.
I am Sixth Lady

416
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,561
of the Luo family.

417
00:19:47,934 --> 00:19:49,175
Sixth Lady?

418
00:19:50,974 --> 00:19:52,534
Are you sure you are the Sixth Lady,

419
00:19:52,815 --> 00:19:54,135
not six ladies?

420
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:55,294
What do you mean?

421
00:19:55,534 --> 00:19:56,895
You are like six ladies in one.

422
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:57,735
If you keep eating,

423
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,120
you'll become seven, eight, and nine.

424
00:19:59,175 --> 00:20:01,399
How dare you humiliate me!

425
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:02,550
I'm not.

426
00:20:02,734 --> 00:20:04,014
I'm just reminding you.

427
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:05,664
What's wrong with being plump? I...

428
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:06,944
Have I taken up your house?

429
00:20:06,992 --> 00:20:07,888
Have I eaten your food?

430
00:20:07,936 --> 00:20:08,832
Have I used your fabrics?

431
00:20:08,848 --> 00:20:10,896
Moreover, I can always slim down, right?

432
00:20:10,912 --> 00:20:11,690
- Yes.
- You...

433
00:20:12,014 --> 00:20:13,815
But you will be ugly forever.

434
00:20:13,936 --> 00:20:16,214
My yard is so beautiful.
By standing here,

435
00:20:16,294 --> 00:20:17,774
you are polluting the beauty of my yard.

436
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,440
How dare you call me ugly.

437
00:20:20,335 --> 00:20:22,254
I'm the most handsome man in Lin'an.

438
00:20:23,855 --> 00:20:25,014
Ridiculous.

439
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,360
Is there only one man in Lin'an?

440
00:20:27,385 --> 00:20:27,746
You...

441
00:20:29,534 --> 00:20:31,014
Fu Gui, let's go home.

442
00:20:31,044 --> 00:20:32,044
There's an evil woman here.

443
00:20:32,069 --> 00:20:33,069
Let's go.

444
00:20:35,415 --> 00:20:36,375
I'm so mad.

445
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,481
Calm down.

446
00:20:40,415 --> 00:20:42,214
He said that he was from Lin'an.

447
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,401
Second Aunt is from Lin'an too.

448
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:55,130
Young Master.
We received a letter from Qi An stating

449
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:56,544
that Li Yinglong has made a move today.

450
00:20:56,544 --> 00:20:57,648
He has left the inn.

451
00:20:58,734 --> 00:21:00,694
Let's see who he's meeting.

452
00:21:01,095 --> 00:21:02,895
Stay in the residence and
clean these up for me.

453
00:21:03,415 --> 00:21:04,454
Yes, Young Master.

454
00:21:14,615 --> 00:21:15,655
Where is it?

455
00:21:21,214 --> 00:21:23,640
Young Master,
those men in black are not our men.

456
00:21:24,095 --> 00:21:26,415
Is there anyone else
who's coming after Li Yinglong?

457
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:29,216
They're probably working for the man
Li Yinglong wants to seek refuge with.

458
00:21:29,694 --> 00:21:30,934
Take me to your master.

459
00:21:31,335 --> 00:21:32,734
Where is it?

460
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,615
I'll hand it over

461
00:21:34,774 --> 00:21:36,135
when I see your master.

462
00:21:38,494 --> 00:21:39,135
Wait.

463
00:21:39,974 --> 00:21:41,454
If you kill me today,

464
00:21:41,472 --> 00:21:43,872
that thing will show up at
the Court of Judicial Review tomorrow.

465
00:21:45,815 --> 00:21:48,655
You better think twice before you act.

466
00:21:51,774 --> 00:21:52,335
Attack!

467
00:23:14,375 --> 00:23:14,974
Retreat!

468
00:23:25,175 --> 00:23:25,774
Young Master.

469
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:27,280
Li Yinglong managed to escape.

470
00:23:27,296 --> 00:23:28,540
I've sent someone to follow him.

471
00:23:29,855 --> 00:23:31,175
Be cautious after this.

472
00:23:31,376 --> 00:23:32,770
They are wearing the Gold Body Armor.

473
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:33,840
They are the Imperial Guards.

474
00:23:33,872 --> 00:23:36,570
So, the culprit is someone
from the Imperial Guards?

475
00:23:38,494 --> 00:23:40,974
I think the culprit is someone
with a higher status.

476
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,730
By the way, Young Master,

477
00:23:44,135 --> 00:23:45,175
what did those men in black

478
00:23:45,202 --> 00:23:47,254
want Li Yinglong to hand over?

479
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,504
I think Li Yinglong

480
00:23:49,552 --> 00:23:51,290
must have kept the evidence
from that incident.

481
00:23:51,415 --> 00:23:53,655
Otherwise, how could he
strike a deal with that culprit?

482
00:24:12,494 --> 00:24:13,734
Are you Ms. Li?

483
00:24:15,615 --> 00:24:16,214
Let's go.

484
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,290
Where is the thing
that Concubine Qiao promised me?

485
00:24:21,375 --> 00:24:23,615
Come with me and I'll give it to you.

486
00:24:26,175 --> 00:24:28,415
She said that she would
give me some money

487
00:24:28,615 --> 00:24:30,214
to retire to my homeland.

488
00:24:38,694 --> 00:24:40,575
I'll give you the money
after we leave the city.

489
00:24:40,655 --> 00:24:42,415
No. Give the money to me now.

490
00:24:42,694 --> 00:24:43,774
I'll leave the city myself.

491
00:24:44,135 --> 00:24:45,335
Do you think

492
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,774
you can really go back to your homeland?

493
00:24:51,175 --> 00:24:53,294
You. What are you going to do?

494
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:53,959
Take her away.

495
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:55,000
What are you doing?

496
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,830
Get into the carriage!

497
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:57,014
Walk!

498
00:24:58,896 --> 00:24:59,810
Get into the carriage!

499
00:24:59,974 --> 00:25:01,055
Hurry up! Get in!

500
00:25:04,415 --> 00:25:05,055
Run.

501
00:25:16,294 --> 00:25:17,135
Catch them!

502
00:25:36,974 --> 00:25:38,655
Run!

503
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:05,841
Seventh Lady.

504
00:26:06,575 --> 00:26:08,055
Why are you doing this?

505
00:26:08,294 --> 00:26:10,918
I've gotten old and useless.

506
00:26:11,175 --> 00:26:12,655
Madam Lin is kind enough

507
00:26:12,774 --> 00:26:14,855
to allow me to retire back
to my homeland.

508
00:26:15,855 --> 00:26:17,214
We should let Ms. Li

509
00:26:17,294 --> 00:26:18,655
explain to Concubine Qiao

510
00:26:18,734 --> 00:26:20,415
about what happened herself.

511
00:26:20,734 --> 00:26:22,055
Looks like

512
00:26:22,162 --> 00:26:24,895
you still don't understand
Concubine Qiao's goal.

513
00:26:26,055 --> 00:26:27,655
Qing Qu, let's go.

514
00:26:27,978 --> 00:26:29,498
Seventh Lady, wait.

515
00:26:32,254 --> 00:26:33,214
Ms. Li.

516
00:26:34,454 --> 00:26:36,014
Do you really think

517
00:26:36,135 --> 00:26:37,815
you entered my abode by chance?

518
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:41,055
Do you think you got out

519
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:42,610
to carry the Chinese peony by chance?

520
00:26:48,175 --> 00:26:50,294
Your life lies in Concubine Qiao's hands

521
00:26:50,815 --> 00:26:52,135
as much as mine.

522
00:26:52,415 --> 00:26:54,335
Ten years ago, your husband passed away.

523
00:26:54,534 --> 00:26:56,375
He suffered from tuberculosis
for a long time.

524
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,521
It took a lot of money
to treat him, right?

525
00:26:58,934 --> 00:27:00,095
Not only that,

526
00:27:00,375 --> 00:27:01,454
according to your neighbors,

527
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:03,210
after your husband passed away,

528
00:27:03,534 --> 00:27:05,014
he had a grand funeral.

529
00:27:05,254 --> 00:27:07,335
Both of you were
so deeply in love with each other.

530
00:27:09,095 --> 00:27:11,415
Do you think I was too young to be wise?

531
00:27:11,575 --> 00:27:14,294
I wouldn't dare.

532
00:27:14,494 --> 00:27:17,214
I didn't have a choice back then.

533
00:27:17,335 --> 00:27:19,335
You don't have a choice now either.

534
00:27:19,454 --> 00:27:20,694
You better think carefully

535
00:27:20,774 --> 00:27:22,774
about what you should do.

536
00:27:23,175 --> 00:27:24,694
I'm sure you know

537
00:27:24,895 --> 00:27:26,494
what I want to know.

538
00:27:28,135 --> 00:27:29,175
Actually...

539
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,719
Actually, before you pushed her,

540
00:27:36,974 --> 00:27:39,454
Concubine Qiao already lost her baby.

541
00:27:39,895 --> 00:27:41,254
But the physician said

542
00:27:41,375 --> 00:27:42,375
that it was a boy.

543
00:27:42,432 --> 00:27:44,096
So, Second Master
cared a lot for the baby.

544
00:27:44,375 --> 00:27:46,624
Concubine Qiao lost the baby

545
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:47,961
due to her own fault.

546
00:27:48,528 --> 00:27:50,544
She was scared that
Second Master would blame him.

547
00:27:50,815 --> 00:27:53,095
So, she plotted against you.

548
00:27:53,175 --> 00:27:55,335
Back then, you were the one
who hired Physician Chen.

549
00:27:55,454 --> 00:27:57,014
Where is he now?

550
00:27:57,135 --> 00:27:59,734
That physician's name is Meng, not Chen.

551
00:27:59,934 --> 00:28:02,014
To prevent others
from finding out the truth,

552
00:28:02,254 --> 00:28:04,335
Concubine Qiao hired the physician
from Yangzhou.

553
00:28:04,694 --> 00:28:05,974
After he treated her,

554
00:28:06,454 --> 00:28:08,534
he was sent back to Yangzhou.

555
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:09,599
What about

556
00:28:10,175 --> 00:28:11,375
the rumors

557
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,120
about my mother

558
00:28:13,615 --> 00:28:15,055
framing Concubine Qiao?

559
00:28:16,895 --> 00:28:18,014
Those rumors

560
00:28:19,335 --> 00:28:20,855
were just a plot

561
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,440
set by Concubine Qiao.

562
00:28:23,214 --> 00:28:25,175
She was worried
when Second Master paid

563
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:28,055
more and more attention
to Madam Gu after marrying her.

564
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:30,254
So, she plotted against her
repeatedly to make

565
00:28:30,279 --> 00:28:32,158
Second Master think
that Madam Gu hated her.

566
00:28:32,534 --> 00:28:35,014
It was the same for Minglan Hall.

567
00:28:35,175 --> 00:28:35,934
Talk.

568
00:28:36,375 --> 00:28:37,934
The Taoist

569
00:28:38,014 --> 00:28:40,655
who suggested tearing down Minglan Hall

570
00:28:40,734 --> 00:28:42,734
was bribed by Concubine Qiao too.

571
00:28:43,095 --> 00:28:45,294
Back then, Old Madam was ill

572
00:28:45,312 --> 00:28:46,890
and Second Master
was having a hard time.

573
00:28:47,014 --> 00:28:48,175
So, Concubine Qiao

574
00:28:48,294 --> 00:28:50,014
used bad feng shui as an excuse

575
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:52,158
to tear down Minglan Hall
to build the pond.

576
00:28:52,454 --> 00:28:55,415
Actually, she just wanted to take over
Madam Gu's private room.

577
00:28:55,694 --> 00:28:57,534
I didn't take part
in any of those things.

578
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,600
I heard them by chance.

579
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:05,774
She was taken away?

580
00:29:05,974 --> 00:29:07,214
By who?

581
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,080
We don't know.

582
00:29:09,615 --> 00:29:11,454
Could it be Luo Yining?

583
00:29:11,655 --> 00:29:12,774
I don't think so.

584
00:29:12,855 --> 00:29:14,494
More than 10 years have passed.

585
00:29:14,615 --> 00:29:16,294
Seventh Lady was just a young girl.

586
00:29:16,319 --> 00:29:17,878
She didn't know better.

587
00:29:19,175 --> 00:29:20,774
Write a letter to Fifth Master.

588
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,358
Ask him to send someone to Yangzhou

589
00:29:22,509 --> 00:29:23,829
to bring back Physician Meng.

590
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,774
I need to keep him under my watch

591
00:29:26,809 --> 00:29:27,849
to feel at ease.

592
00:29:28,135 --> 00:29:29,575
I'll get it done right now.

593
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,400
Go now.

594
00:29:32,853 --> 00:29:34,665
(Zuixian Restaurant)

595
00:29:37,014 --> 00:29:39,575
A masked man showed up out of the blue

596
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,440
and saved you?

597
00:29:41,294 --> 00:29:43,655
When I was almost defeated
by Concubine Qiao's men,

598
00:29:43,748 --> 00:29:45,309
that person showed up.

599
00:29:46,214 --> 00:29:48,655
But that place was uninhabited.

600
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:51,041
Why would someone help you?

601
00:29:51,895 --> 00:29:53,415
It was strange.

602
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:55,454
No matter what,

603
00:29:55,495 --> 00:29:57,455
I'll have to trouble you

604
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,080
to travel to Yangzhou again.

605
00:30:00,014 --> 00:30:01,335
You don't have to be so courteous.

606
00:30:01,362 --> 00:30:02,483
Ms. Zheng sent me here

607
00:30:02,543 --> 00:30:04,504
to serve you.

608
00:30:04,934 --> 00:30:06,934
Ms. Zheng did her best

609
00:30:06,982 --> 00:30:08,661
to take care of my mother
for so many years.

610
00:30:09,055 --> 00:30:11,494
Until my mother passed away.

611
00:30:11,774 --> 00:30:13,774
Only then did she return home to rest.

612
00:30:14,294 --> 00:30:16,294
If I can find a chance in the future,

613
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:17,440
I want to invite her back

614
00:30:17,552 --> 00:30:18,890
to Luo's Residence to take a look.

615
00:30:19,254 --> 00:30:20,774
According to Ms. Zheng,

616
00:30:20,895 --> 00:30:22,615
she will not step a foot

617
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,120
into Luo's Residence ever again.

618
00:30:24,249 --> 00:30:25,329
That's why she sent me here

619
00:30:25,354 --> 00:30:26,395
to serve you.

620
00:30:27,014 --> 00:30:27,895
Why?

621
00:30:28,694 --> 00:30:30,534
I don't know.

622
00:30:33,055 --> 00:30:35,615
Maybe she has her own reasons.

623
00:30:37,375 --> 00:30:39,734
I've prepared some money for you.

624
00:30:39,895 --> 00:30:40,895
Keep it with you.

625
00:30:41,175 --> 00:30:43,014
Use it when you need it.

626
00:30:43,042 --> 00:30:44,641
Treat yourself better.

627
00:30:44,774 --> 00:30:45,694
Don't worry, Young Lady.

628
00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:47,263
I won't treat myself shabbily.

629
00:30:47,895 --> 00:30:49,214
I will

630
00:30:49,239 --> 00:30:50,878
definitely find Physician Meng.

631
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,204
(Marquis Anbei's Residence)

632
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,076
(Cheng Lang)

633
00:32:15,095 --> 00:32:15,655
Uncle!

634
00:32:15,734 --> 00:32:17,014
Uncle, have mercy on me!

635
00:32:33,524 --> 00:32:35,991
(Lu Jiaxue)

636
00:32:36,855 --> 00:32:39,175
You failed to take his life
within ten moves.

637
00:32:39,895 --> 00:32:41,135
Your skills have dropped.

638
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:43,690
Please forgive us, Marquis.

639
00:32:43,717 --> 00:32:45,316
Go and receive
your punishment of 30 hits.

640
00:32:45,815 --> 00:32:46,494
Yes, Marquis.

641
00:32:53,014 --> 00:32:53,855
Uncle.

642
00:32:54,254 --> 00:32:56,294
Are you trying to train me with your men

643
00:32:57,095 --> 00:32:58,686
or are you trying to take my...

644
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,240
There's no mercy in the battlefield.

645
00:33:00,415 --> 00:33:01,815
Only life and death.

646
00:33:02,974 --> 00:33:04,655
Weapons don't choose who to kill.

647
00:33:06,534 --> 00:33:07,534
Do you think

648
00:33:07,855 --> 00:33:09,855
I got this Marquis Anbei's Residence
through luck?

649
00:33:10,974 --> 00:33:11,974
I'm sorry.

650
00:33:13,375 --> 00:33:14,494
I know

651
00:33:15,135 --> 00:33:17,375
you are laid-back and
prefer spending time with women.

652
00:33:17,655 --> 00:33:19,454
As your uncle, I don't care.

653
00:33:19,615 --> 00:33:20,855
But I hope

654
00:33:22,375 --> 00:33:24,375
that you won't let
your mother down too much.

655
00:33:25,095 --> 00:33:25,774
Yes, Uncle.

656
00:33:26,415 --> 00:33:27,214
You may leave.

657
00:33:33,734 --> 00:33:34,694
I'm incompetent.

658
00:33:35,135 --> 00:33:36,294
A few men in black showed up

659
00:33:36,349 --> 00:33:37,668
and helped Li Yinglong get away.

660
00:33:38,254 --> 00:33:39,175
We didn't

661
00:33:39,655 --> 00:33:40,655
get the thing too.

662
00:33:41,694 --> 00:33:43,335
Did Li Yinglong say anything?

663
00:33:45,294 --> 00:33:46,014
He said

664
00:33:46,575 --> 00:33:48,175
he would only hand it over

665
00:33:48,454 --> 00:33:49,934
after he met you.

666
00:33:50,375 --> 00:33:51,655
Let me go and meet him, then.

667
00:33:52,494 --> 00:33:54,175
Let's see what he has to say.

668
00:33:54,375 --> 00:33:55,095
Marquis,

669
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:57,090
Li Yinglong set
the meeting venue and time

670
00:33:57,135 --> 00:33:59,123
at a place near the Yuanjing Pavilion
in two days.

671
00:33:59,930 --> 00:34:02,752
The Shen family has hired
a group of performers

672
00:34:02,768 --> 00:34:04,050
and invited all the noble families

673
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:06,320
to watch a show at the Yuanjing Pavilion
in two days, right?

674
00:34:06,375 --> 00:34:08,655
Yes. They have sent you
an invitation letter too.

675
00:34:09,774 --> 00:34:12,055
Li Yinglong has really
put in a of effort in this.

676
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:14,559
He chose this place
that would be bustling with people.

677
00:34:15,374 --> 00:34:16,055
I understand.

678
00:34:16,734 --> 00:34:17,455
Cheng Lang.

679
00:34:17,935 --> 00:34:18,535
Uncle.

680
00:34:19,455 --> 00:34:20,975
As for the show,

681
00:34:21,175 --> 00:34:22,975
you can attend it

682
00:34:23,023 --> 00:34:24,583
on behalf of Marquis Anbei's Residence.

683
00:34:25,854 --> 00:34:27,175
I'll take care of it, Uncle.

684
00:34:27,734 --> 00:34:28,374
Go now.

685
00:34:32,975 --> 00:34:33,615
Come here.

686
00:34:35,495 --> 00:34:36,135
Marquis.

687
00:34:36,615 --> 00:34:38,095
Any news about that person

688
00:34:38,495 --> 00:34:39,694
I asked you to find?

689
00:34:39,935 --> 00:34:40,935
I'm incompetent.

690
00:34:41,615 --> 00:34:42,935
I did my best to find him.

691
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,360
I searched all the farmhouses
within 100 miles of the courtyard.

692
00:34:45,535 --> 00:34:47,579
But I couldn't find any farm girl

693
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,976
who was similar to your description.

694
00:34:51,414 --> 00:34:52,894
I'll do my best to find her.

695
00:34:53,334 --> 00:34:54,175
Forget it.

696
00:34:55,774 --> 00:34:57,334
Do your best

697
00:34:57,489 --> 00:34:58,609
to handle Li Yinglong first.

698
00:34:59,055 --> 00:35:00,135
I'll hand over this matter

699
00:35:00,694 --> 00:35:02,254
to another person.

700
00:35:03,294 --> 00:35:03,894
Go.

701
00:35:05,455 --> 00:35:06,055
Yes, Marquis.

702
00:35:15,214 --> 00:35:16,015
Mei.

703
00:35:16,774 --> 00:35:18,254
Where are you?

704
00:35:27,214 --> 00:35:28,975
Young Lady. The clothes that you ordered

705
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,095
for Third Young Master are done.

706
00:35:32,414 --> 00:35:33,095
Really?

707
00:35:33,334 --> 00:35:35,095
Let's deliver them.

708
00:35:35,175 --> 00:35:36,694
Are you going to go there in person?

709
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,840
But Shao'an already
told us no last time.

710
00:35:38,942 --> 00:35:40,781
Will he refuse to see us again?

711
00:35:42,694 --> 00:35:44,575
We'll know when we deliver the gift.

712
00:35:52,374 --> 00:35:53,055
Young Master.

713
00:35:53,254 --> 00:35:54,854
Ms. Qing Qu just took a bag

714
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:56,096
and left from the second gate.

715
00:35:57,495 --> 00:35:59,615
Was she the one you saw in the forest?

716
00:36:03,894 --> 00:36:04,975
Yining

717
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,890
has started to investigate the truth

718
00:36:06,919 --> 00:36:08,278
about the case back then.

719
00:36:09,095 --> 00:36:11,214
Ask the shops along the way

720
00:36:11,414 --> 00:36:12,774
to take care of her in secret.

721
00:36:12,894 --> 00:36:14,774
Send two reliable men

722
00:36:15,455 --> 00:36:17,694
to stay close and protect her.

723
00:36:17,894 --> 00:36:18,655
Young Master.

724
00:36:18,935 --> 00:36:21,368
I thought you wanted to keep
your distance from them?

725
00:36:21,734 --> 00:36:22,774
Anybody here?

726
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:24,694
Shao'an, are you in?

727
00:36:25,334 --> 00:36:27,214
I think Seventh Lady
and her maid are here.

728
00:36:27,854 --> 00:36:29,015
I can tell.

729
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,072
- Tell them that I'm not here.
- Young Master.

730
00:36:44,055 --> 00:36:45,854
Ms. Xue Zhi, why are you here?

731
00:36:45,935 --> 00:36:47,055
Young Lady asked me

732
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,832
to give Third Young Master
some new clothes.

733
00:36:48,864 --> 00:36:49,890
Is Third Young Master here?

734
00:36:50,734 --> 00:36:53,480
Unfortunately, he just went out.

735
00:36:59,814 --> 00:37:00,655
Third Brother.

736
00:37:01,334 --> 00:37:03,734
Third Brother, are you hiding from me?

737
00:37:04,095 --> 00:37:05,374
I'm not.

738
00:37:05,894 --> 00:37:07,214
You must be joking.

739
00:37:07,334 --> 00:37:09,854
Why did you use the back door
instead of the front door?

740
00:37:10,734 --> 00:37:13,615
There's a dessert shop that opened up
in the market near the back door.

741
00:37:13,661 --> 00:37:15,301
Your favorite loquat yogurt
is sold there.

742
00:37:15,344 --> 00:37:16,624
So, I want to buy some for you.

743
00:37:17,655 --> 00:37:18,774
I see.

744
00:37:19,254 --> 00:37:20,774
Thank you, Third Brother.

745
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:22,928
Since you are here.
Let's go in and take a seat.

746
00:37:22,944 --> 00:37:24,590
I'll ask Shao'an
to buy some for you later.

747
00:37:24,592 --> 00:37:25,250
Third Brother.

748
00:37:25,575 --> 00:37:28,015
You don't have to take
what Father said to heart.

749
00:37:28,214 --> 00:37:29,455
You are hiding from me

750
00:37:29,535 --> 00:37:31,575
because you don't want

751
00:37:31,694 --> 00:37:33,055
to bring me trouble, right?

752
00:37:36,294 --> 00:37:37,495
I just

753
00:37:38,334 --> 00:37:40,774
don't want to cause more trouble.

754
00:37:41,374 --> 00:37:42,615
Even without you,

755
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,961
Father has a deep prejudice against me.

756
00:37:45,294 --> 00:37:46,894
The trouble that I bring

757
00:37:47,175 --> 00:37:48,814
maybe even more serious

758
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:51,095
than the trouble that you can bring.

759
00:37:51,694 --> 00:37:54,095
Besides, we didn't do anything wrong.

760
00:37:54,694 --> 00:37:56,414
When we were young,

761
00:37:56,694 --> 00:37:59,774
you fell down from the tree
because of me.

762
00:38:01,254 --> 00:38:02,734
I remember that now.

763
00:38:04,352 --> 00:38:06,570
I already forgot about what happened
when we were young.

764
00:38:07,615 --> 00:38:08,455
Come in.

765
00:38:10,455 --> 00:38:11,374
Ms. Xue Zhi.

766
00:38:11,495 --> 00:38:13,175
Our Young Master has gone out.

767
00:38:13,227 --> 00:38:15,068
How about you go back first?

768
00:38:15,254 --> 00:38:16,655
Maybe he'll be back soon.

769
00:38:16,707 --> 00:38:17,707
I'll wait for him.

770
00:38:18,015 --> 00:38:19,615
He won't be back

771
00:38:19,662 --> 00:38:21,023
so soon.

772
00:38:21,455 --> 00:38:23,535
Hurry up. I have something nice
to show you.

773
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,600
- Hurry up.
- What is it?

774
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,680
Here he is.

775
00:38:27,334 --> 00:38:27,935
Where?

776
00:38:31,655 --> 00:38:32,535
Seventh Lady.

777
00:38:32,741 --> 00:38:35,055
How many clothes
did you make for Young Master?

778
00:38:35,175 --> 00:38:36,254
Our Young Lady says,

779
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,512
let Third Young Master
try out every piece of clothing.

780
00:38:38,528 --> 00:38:40,090
Don't let her down.

781
00:38:40,455 --> 00:38:41,095
All?

782
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:45,334
Fine.

783
00:39:27,334 --> 00:39:28,374
Are you done?

784
00:39:29,254 --> 00:39:30,814
Seventh Lady, he's done.

785
00:39:30,861 --> 00:39:32,062
All of them fit well.

786
00:39:32,167 --> 00:39:33,128
Let me take a look.

787
00:39:41,294 --> 00:39:42,975
This outfit really enhances

788
00:39:43,022 --> 00:39:44,821
your handsome features.

789
00:40:00,254 --> 00:40:02,015
The material is really good.

790
00:40:04,734 --> 00:40:06,135
Thank you, Yining.

791
00:40:07,575 --> 00:40:08,917
If you want to thank me,

792
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,159
how about you pick some loquats for me?

793
00:40:11,322 --> 00:40:13,162
Make sure to do it personally

794
00:40:13,375 --> 00:40:15,295
to show your sincerity.

795
00:40:15,655 --> 00:40:16,294
Okay.

796
00:40:16,774 --> 00:40:19,414
Shao'an and I will go
and pick some loquats.

797
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:20,702
Then I'll go back first.

798
00:40:20,935 --> 00:40:23,502
I'll wait for your loquats to make
some loquat yogurt with.

799
00:40:35,202 --> 00:40:36,363
What are you looking at?

800
00:40:37,344 --> 00:40:39,328
Young Master,
you said you didn't want to see her.

801
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,170
But then, you were talking
and laughing with her.

802
00:40:41,175 --> 00:40:42,135
You made me look bad.

803
00:40:42,254 --> 00:40:43,854
Talk less and let's get to work.

804
00:40:44,935 --> 00:40:45,455
Let's go.

805
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:49,535
(Jimo House)

806
00:40:49,535 --> 00:40:51,575
Xue Zhi, stay here.

807
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,734
If someone is here, give me a warning.

808
00:40:53,894 --> 00:40:54,575
Yes, Young Lady.

809
00:41:22,455 --> 00:41:23,294
What's wrong?

810
00:41:25,615 --> 00:41:28,374
Why are there clothes everywhere?

811
00:41:30,455 --> 00:41:32,380
Are you picking out
an outfit for the show

812
00:41:32,405 --> 00:41:33,405
at Yuanjing Pavilion?

813
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,480
This is beautiful.

814
00:41:34,774 --> 00:41:35,854
Mother.

815
00:41:36,414 --> 00:41:38,575
Ms. Shen invited me to watch a show

816
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,280
at Yuanjing Pavilion.

817
00:41:40,655 --> 00:41:42,960
But I don't even have
a nice dress to wear.

818
00:41:43,214 --> 00:41:45,694
Please get two rolls
of silk brocade for me.

819
00:41:47,095 --> 00:41:48,175
Enough.

820
00:41:48,655 --> 00:41:50,894
It wasn't easy to get
your father to calm down.

821
00:41:50,975 --> 00:41:53,175
Now, you should keep a low profile.

822
00:41:53,535 --> 00:41:55,135
All of your dresses

823
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,521
are made with high-quality materials.

824
00:41:56,570 --> 00:41:58,689
You just need to pick one.

825
00:41:59,414 --> 00:42:00,975
Mother.

826
00:42:01,175 --> 00:42:03,175
All who attend the show
at Yuanjing Pavilion

827
00:42:03,215 --> 00:42:05,215
are distinguished
and prestigious people.

828
00:42:05,374 --> 00:42:07,175
If I wear an old dress,

829
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,294
Luo's Residence will be laughed at.

830
00:42:09,935 --> 00:42:11,135
Look at you.

831
00:42:11,495 --> 00:42:12,254
Enough.

832
00:42:12,935 --> 00:42:15,135
I'll send someone
to your Fifth Uncle's shop

833
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,840
to get some old dresses for you.

834
00:42:18,115 --> 00:42:19,475
You are the best.

835
00:42:20,135 --> 00:42:21,455
Come. Take a seat.

836
00:42:23,455 --> 00:42:24,055
By the way,

837
00:42:24,734 --> 00:42:25,975
although Ms. Shen

838
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,679
has invited you alone,

839
00:42:28,135 --> 00:42:30,175
it'll be improper if no other ladies

840
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,376
from Luo's Residence attend it.

841
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:33,920
You need to give some respect
to other ladies in the residence too.

842
00:42:34,254 --> 00:42:36,294
Find a way

843
00:42:36,774 --> 00:42:37,975
to convince Ms. Shen

844
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,839
to invite all the ladies
in Luo's Residence

845
00:42:39,864 --> 00:42:41,504
to the show at Yuanjing Pavilion.

846
00:42:42,055 --> 00:42:43,455
All the ladies?

847
00:42:43,774 --> 00:42:45,455
Luo Yining will be included, then.

848
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,384
I don't want that.

849
00:42:46,455 --> 00:42:47,495
Be good.

850
00:42:47,575 --> 00:42:49,175
Just do as I say.

851
00:42:49,334 --> 00:42:51,175
I have my reasons.

852
00:43:11,854 --> 00:43:12,935
Just the two of them?

853
00:43:13,334 --> 00:43:14,615
Concubine Qiao, don't worry.

854
00:43:15,055 --> 00:43:16,774
Both of them are as strong as bulls.

855
00:43:16,854 --> 00:43:18,015
Fifth Master ordered me

856
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,159
to choose two capable men.

857
00:43:19,694 --> 00:43:21,294
I did my best.

858
00:43:21,615 --> 00:43:23,535
It won't be easy to sneak into the show.

859
00:43:23,655 --> 00:43:24,935
Do you know how to get in?

860
00:43:24,944 --> 00:43:26,144
They'll replace the helmsmen.

861
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:27,264
Everything has been arranged.

862
00:43:27,294 --> 00:43:29,535
I'll hold you responsible if you fail.

863
00:43:29,694 --> 00:43:30,575
I understand.

864
00:43:30,656 --> 00:43:31,888
Although Fifth Master is not here,

865
00:43:31,894 --> 00:43:32,894
I'll be able

866
00:43:32,975 --> 00:43:34,655
