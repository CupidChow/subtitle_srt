(Adapted from Wen Tan's novel "Chancellor
Training Handbook" from Jinjiang Literature)

00:01:36,541 --> 00:01:38,759
=Episode 10=

4
00:01:39,908 --> 00:01:41,564
(Chengjing Hall)

5
00:01:49,502 --> 00:01:51,062
Greetings, Mother.

6
00:01:51,302 --> 00:01:52,502
Please be at ease.

7
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,560
Greetings, Grandma.

8
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,239
Please get up.

9
00:02:09,142 --> 00:02:10,582
Thank you, Grandma.

10
00:02:22,774 --> 00:02:24,665
The second son of the Cheng Family

11
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:27,690
told me this morning

12
00:02:28,001 --> 00:02:30,200
that he's returning home.

13
00:02:31,168 --> 00:02:32,848
So I was thinking of

14
00:02:33,025 --> 00:02:34,706
holding a farewell banquet

15
00:02:35,025 --> 00:02:36,986
in the courtyard.

16
00:02:37,146 --> 00:02:38,179
Don't worry, Mother.

17
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,540
I will make sure it's done properly.

18
00:02:40,546 --> 00:02:42,226
Mr. Cheng

19
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:43,569
is leaving?

20
00:02:44,946 --> 00:02:46,305
Mr. Cheng

21
00:02:46,386 --> 00:02:48,426
came to pay me a visit

22
00:02:48,426 --> 00:02:50,465
on his grandma's behalf.

23
00:02:50,465 --> 00:02:53,386
He said he has many matters to handle

24
00:02:53,411 --> 00:02:56,092
and can't be delayed.

25
00:03:02,146 --> 00:03:04,666
All right, Hairu and I

26
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,321
have something important to discuss.

27
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,720
You are dismissed.

28
00:03:10,678 --> 00:03:12,359
We will take our leave.

29
00:03:21,426 --> 00:03:22,386
Hairu,

30
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:26,126
did the yamen say anything

31
00:03:26,546 --> 00:03:29,065
about the burned body?

32
00:03:29,426 --> 00:03:30,745
They can't identify the body.

33
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:33,426
Given that we never made enemies
with anyone,

34
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:34,585
the yamen suspects

35
00:03:34,697 --> 00:03:37,177
it was a thief who broke in to rob.

36
00:03:38,465 --> 00:03:39,905
Do you believe that?

37
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,240
(Jimo Hall)

38
00:03:47,603 --> 00:03:48,203
Seventh Lady,

39
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,520
Young Master doesn't feel
quite well today.

40
00:03:50,545 --> 00:03:51,464
He's resting now.

41
00:03:51,706 --> 00:03:53,065
He doesn't feel quite well?

42
00:03:55,305 --> 00:03:56,025
Seventh Lady.

43
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,641
Get up!

44
00:04:06,905 --> 00:04:08,106
What's wrong, Yining?

45
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,464
Leave us.

46
00:04:14,305 --> 00:04:14,946
Don't worry.

47
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,721
You are dismissed.

48
00:04:18,585 --> 00:04:19,545
Yes.

49
00:04:25,626 --> 00:04:27,105
Did you set the fire

50
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,080
at Yixin Abode?

51
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,240
Did you also bring that body in?

52
00:04:30,266 --> 00:04:30,946
Yes.

53
00:04:31,225 --> 00:04:32,225
Why did you do

54
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,650
such a dangerous thing?

55
00:04:34,186 --> 00:04:35,665
You burned Grandpa's study

56
00:04:35,746 --> 00:04:37,826
and all his legacy into ashes.

57
00:04:37,888 --> 00:04:39,632
Did you forget
what you have promised me?

58
00:04:39,665 --> 00:04:40,866
Yining, do you trust me?

59
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,879
I do,

60
00:04:42,896 --> 00:04:44,112
but I really can't understand

61
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,260
why you did that.

62
00:04:46,105 --> 00:04:47,105
I did that

63
00:04:47,323 --> 00:04:48,803
for the sake of the Luo's Residence

64
00:04:49,072 --> 00:04:50,193
and Old Madam.

65
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,720
Enough questions.

66
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,039
Knowing too much

67
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:54,967
won't do you any good.

68
00:05:06,657 --> 00:05:08,563
(Haitang Abode)

69
00:05:09,409 --> 00:05:11,008
Young Lady, look who's here.

70
00:05:11,946 --> 00:05:12,585
Young Lady.

71
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,440
Qing Qu, you are finally back.

72
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,200
How was your trip?

73
00:05:16,225 --> 00:05:17,626
It was fairly smooth.

74
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,336
I got to know

75
00:05:18,352 --> 00:05:19,720
the Zhang brothers from the Cao Sect.

76
00:05:19,746 --> 00:05:20,706
They helped me a lot.

77
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,600
Cao Sect?

78
00:05:22,506 --> 00:05:24,019
I ran into them halfway.

79
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:25,331
The elder brother got injured,

80
00:05:25,356 --> 00:05:25,957
and I saved him.

81
00:05:26,186 --> 00:05:27,146
As a thank you,

82
00:05:27,171 --> 00:05:28,746
they escorted me all the way back.

83
00:05:29,866 --> 00:05:30,785
Don't worry, Young Lady.

84
00:05:30,866 --> 00:05:32,425
They are very reliable.

85
00:05:33,306 --> 00:05:34,345
You are a discreet person,

86
00:05:34,371 --> 00:05:35,612
so I certainly won't doubt you.

87
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,758
Well, where is Physician Meng?

88
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,420
He has already settled down
in the inn.

89
00:05:40,545 --> 00:05:42,345
The Zhang brothers are keeping
an eye on him.

90
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,601
All right. I will go meet him now.

91
00:05:53,465 --> 00:05:55,826
Mistress Qiao, Qing Qu has returned,

92
00:05:55,985 --> 00:05:57,785
and she left again with Seventh Lady

93
00:05:57,905 --> 00:05:59,905
after staying in Haitang Abode
for a while.

94
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,856
Tell Fifth Master
to follow them closely.

95
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,420
Don't mess it up.

96
00:06:03,626 --> 00:06:04,266
Yes.

97
00:06:12,345 --> 00:06:13,425
So beautiful.

98
00:06:14,743 --> 00:06:17,094
(Liuhe Tavern)

99
00:06:40,785 --> 00:06:41,339
Young Master,

100
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,810
Fifth Master Qiao has been watching
downstairs for quite some time.

101
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:45,450
Should I go deal with him?

102
00:06:45,883 --> 00:06:47,123
Just give Seventh Lady a reminder

103
00:06:47,148 --> 00:06:47,788
will do.

104
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:49,471
Don't be too obvious.

105
00:06:49,975 --> 00:06:51,136
As for the rest,

106
00:06:51,312 --> 00:06:52,940
the Zhang brothers will take care of it.

107
00:06:53,296 --> 00:06:54,144
Yes, Young Master.

108
00:06:55,647 --> 00:06:58,328
Everything I said just now is the truth.

109
00:07:00,001 --> 00:07:01,280
My behavior

110
00:07:01,623 --> 00:07:03,303
went against my duty as a physician.

111
00:07:03,345 --> 00:07:04,465
All these years,

112
00:07:04,766 --> 00:07:06,725
I have always blamed myself.

113
00:07:06,866 --> 00:07:08,066
Physician Meng,

114
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:10,760
will you testify for me?

115
00:07:11,134 --> 00:07:12,375
Of course.

116
00:07:12,647 --> 00:07:13,568
Otherwise,

117
00:07:13,626 --> 00:07:15,386
I wouldn't have followed Ms. Qing Qu

118
00:07:15,411 --> 00:07:16,371
into the capital.

119
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:22,605
Physician Meng,
I shall thank you in advance.

120
00:07:22,866 --> 00:07:24,186
Don't flatter me.

121
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,240
Have a nice day. Please come again.

122
00:07:28,905 --> 00:07:30,465
Sir, this way, please.

123
00:07:30,665 --> 00:07:32,266
We have private rooms inside.

124
00:07:36,826 --> 00:07:37,306
You!

125
00:07:38,506 --> 00:07:39,826
Aren't you Fifth Master Qiao?

126
00:07:39,851 --> 00:07:40,771
I'm so sorry.

127
00:07:40,883 --> 00:07:41,962
I was carrying the goods.

128
00:07:41,987 --> 00:07:43,347
I didn't watch carefully.

129
00:07:43,785 --> 00:07:45,146
Are you going in to have a drink?

130
00:07:45,266 --> 00:07:45,985
Go away.

131
00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:48,249
Watch where you go.

132
00:07:49,785 --> 00:07:51,425
Have a nice day. Please come again.

133
00:07:53,178 --> 00:07:53,624
Scram!

134
00:07:58,066 --> 00:07:59,585
Is he here to kidnap the physician?

135
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:00,640
Should we find more people

136
00:08:00,672 --> 00:08:01,712
to protect Physician Meng?

137
00:08:01,985 --> 00:08:02,665
No need.

138
00:08:03,626 --> 00:08:04,946
Ask the Zhang brothers

139
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:06,480
not to get too close to Physician Meng.

140
00:08:06,545 --> 00:08:08,746
If he kidnaps the physician, catch him.

141
00:08:08,905 --> 00:08:10,146
If not,

142
00:08:10,345 --> 00:08:11,186
tell them to observe

143
00:08:11,306 --> 00:08:13,066
what those people are up to.

144
00:08:14,585 --> 00:08:15,105
Let's go.

145
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,919
Mistress Qiao,
Fifth Master sent a message.

146
00:08:23,105 --> 00:08:23,985
It's settled.

147
00:08:24,524 --> 00:08:25,404
Very well.

148
00:08:30,186 --> 00:08:32,146
Yiyu, you have finally recovered.

149
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:33,549
It's good that you can go for a walk.

150
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:35,185
I visited you several times
a few days ago,

151
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:36,249
but I couldn't see you.

152
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:37,680
I was worried about you.

153
00:08:38,425 --> 00:08:39,185
I should thank you

154
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:40,491
for your mind-calming incense.

155
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,344
You are thoughtful.

156
00:08:41,607 --> 00:08:43,286
As long as it helped you.

157
00:08:44,545 --> 00:08:45,626
Yiyu,

158
00:08:45,651 --> 00:08:47,610
were you sick because of Mr. Cheng?

159
00:08:50,586 --> 00:08:51,506
Yilian,

160
00:08:51,626 --> 00:08:53,545
it was just a cold.

161
00:08:54,266 --> 00:08:56,785
Please don't bring it up again.

162
00:08:56,810 --> 00:08:59,276
Yiyu, don't be too discouraged.

163
00:08:59,435 --> 00:09:01,395
Perhaps there's still a chance.

164
00:09:01,746 --> 00:09:03,466
Mr. Cheng is soon leaving.

165
00:09:03,586 --> 00:09:05,346
Let's stop talking about this.

166
00:09:06,825 --> 00:09:08,226
Pay no mind to what I just said.

167
00:09:11,466 --> 00:09:12,746
What are they doing?

168
00:09:12,825 --> 00:09:14,106
Madam Lin recruited

169
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,680
Dongjing City's most popular
theater troupe to perform.

170
00:09:17,065 --> 00:09:18,825
Mr. Cheng is a distinguished guest.

171
00:09:18,986 --> 00:09:20,866
Naturally, the banquet should be lively.

172
00:09:21,545 --> 00:09:22,346
True.

173
00:09:22,825 --> 00:09:23,705
It has been some time

174
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,051
since we had a fun occasion.

175
00:09:25,266 --> 00:09:27,106
Let's go and take a look. Come.

176
00:09:30,545 --> 00:09:31,506
What's that?

177
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,521
The embroidery on this silk waistband
is exquisite,

178
00:09:37,665 --> 00:09:39,866
especially the orchids.

179
00:09:39,931 --> 00:09:41,451
The stitchwork is intricate.

180
00:09:41,746 --> 00:09:43,425
This isn't something
just anyone could use.

181
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:44,969
Why is it left here?

182
00:09:47,305 --> 00:09:49,425
These seven-petaled orchids...

183
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,763
I, Lian Qing,

184
00:09:50,785 --> 00:09:51,866
offer my greetings.

185
00:09:52,305 --> 00:09:53,586
The silk waistband you are holding

186
00:09:53,665 --> 00:09:55,025
is a gift from someone

187
00:09:55,146 --> 00:09:57,146
very important to me.
Please return it to me.

188
00:09:57,327 --> 00:09:58,806
You are Lian Qing?

189
00:09:58,945 --> 00:10:00,025
Yes, I am.

190
00:10:00,305 --> 00:10:02,425
Please return it to me, Young Lady.

191
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,279
Thank you.

192
00:10:09,705 --> 00:10:11,185
Who is this Lian Qing?

193
00:10:11,226 --> 00:10:13,586
He's the most famous performer

194
00:10:13,628 --> 00:10:15,108
in the capital now.

195
00:10:15,506 --> 00:10:16,545
There's always a big turnout

196
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,241
whenever he performs.

197
00:10:18,665 --> 00:10:20,986
But why did he have

198
00:10:21,011 --> 00:10:22,730
such a delicate silk waistband?

199
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,399
Yiyu,

200
00:10:25,506 --> 00:10:28,506
this silk waistband seems familiar.

201
00:10:28,945 --> 00:10:31,866
I think I have seen Yining using it.

202
00:10:31,891 --> 00:10:32,771
What?

203
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:34,975
You can't talk nonsense.

204
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,160
Is this a mistake?

205
00:10:39,945 --> 00:10:41,025
Maybe.

206
00:10:41,506 --> 00:10:42,905
You are right, Yiyu.

207
00:10:43,346 --> 00:10:45,146
Perhaps I made a mistake.

208
00:10:45,346 --> 00:10:46,065
All right.

209
00:10:46,185 --> 00:10:47,986
There are many eyes here.

210
00:10:48,011 --> 00:10:49,371
We better leave now.

211
00:11:00,746 --> 00:11:01,425
Young Lady,

212
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:03,290
why do you look pale these days?

213
00:11:03,409 --> 00:11:05,009
Are you feeling unwell?

214
00:11:06,785 --> 00:11:07,586
I'm fine.

215
00:11:08,386 --> 00:11:10,185
I just have a headache.

216
00:11:10,665 --> 00:11:12,425
The banquet is starting soon.

217
00:11:12,545 --> 00:11:13,626
Are you all right?

218
00:11:15,025 --> 00:11:16,986
Perhaps the rain was heavy last night,

219
00:11:17,028 --> 00:11:18,308
and I caught a cold.

220
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:21,305
Tell the kitchen
to prepare some ginger soup

221
00:11:21,354 --> 00:11:22,954
and bring it to the banquet for me.

222
00:11:23,466 --> 00:11:25,905
All right. Let me brush your hair first.

223
00:11:32,545 --> 00:11:33,466
Song Zhi,

224
00:11:34,336 --> 00:11:35,536
what are you looking at?

225
00:11:36,106 --> 00:11:37,305
Young Lady,

226
00:11:37,466 --> 00:11:39,185
it's strange.

227
00:11:39,305 --> 00:11:40,705
Why hasn't
Third Young Master been

228
00:11:40,772 --> 00:11:42,691
bringing flowers here these days?

229
00:11:51,705 --> 00:11:52,425
Young Lady,

230
00:11:52,699 --> 00:11:54,018
it was raining last night,

231
00:11:54,146 --> 00:11:55,827
and the weather got cold.

232
00:11:55,962 --> 00:11:57,641
Can you stand the cold?

233
00:11:58,866 --> 00:12:00,185
Bring me

234
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:00,969
a cloak.

235
00:12:01,905 --> 00:12:02,626
Yes, Young Lady.

236
00:12:14,466 --> 00:12:15,506
Greetings, Shenyuan.

237
00:12:16,386 --> 00:12:17,185
Yining,

238
00:12:18,065 --> 00:12:19,586
the weather is cold.

239
00:12:19,785 --> 00:12:20,825
Do bundle up.

240
00:12:20,945 --> 00:12:21,945
Shenyuan,

241
00:12:22,065 --> 00:12:23,905
you have been busy every day.

242
00:12:24,025 --> 00:12:25,932
Do take care of your own health.

243
00:12:27,386 --> 00:12:28,106
By the way,

244
00:12:28,305 --> 00:12:29,346
stay out

245
00:12:29,371 --> 00:12:30,411
of my business.

246
00:12:30,785 --> 00:12:32,746
Those grudges have nothing
to do with you.

247
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,200
Young Master,

248
00:12:48,425 --> 00:12:50,226
what does Seventh Lady mean?

249
00:12:50,665 --> 00:12:51,945
Did she already know

250
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,411
you were helping her outside?

251
00:12:55,266 --> 00:12:56,065
Don't be a busybody.

252
00:13:06,803 --> 00:13:07,524
This theater troupe

253
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,896
has been popular in the capital.

254
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,540
They went to great lengths
to invite them.

255
00:13:10,951 --> 00:13:11,951
I see.

256
00:13:18,472 --> 00:13:19,152
Mother,

257
00:13:19,285 --> 00:13:20,206
when will Grandma come?

258
00:13:20,231 --> 00:13:21,511
I'm hungry.

259
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:23,908
Let's wait for a while more.

260
00:13:51,352 --> 00:13:52,352
You are awake.

261
00:13:53,723 --> 00:13:54,603
Who are you?

262
00:13:55,632 --> 00:13:57,032
Who am I?

263
00:13:57,389 --> 00:13:59,789
You don't know me, Seventh Lady?

264
00:14:02,366 --> 00:14:03,166
Look.

265
00:14:03,191 --> 00:14:05,191
You gave me a special gift.

266
00:14:05,272 --> 00:14:06,311
What do you think

267
00:14:06,764 --> 00:14:08,004
I want to do?

268
00:14:08,112 --> 00:14:09,352
Of course I...

269
00:14:09,419 --> 00:14:10,220
Seventh Lady.

270
00:14:11,191 --> 00:14:13,032
Where are you going, Seventh Lady?

271
00:14:13,831 --> 00:14:14,831
Seventh Lady.

272
00:14:16,071 --> 00:14:16,872
Seventh Lady.

273
00:14:17,752 --> 00:14:19,791
Where are you going, Seventh Lady?

274
00:14:20,152 --> 00:14:21,232
Seventh Lady.

275
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:23,711
Seventh Lady.

276
00:14:24,191 --> 00:14:25,232
Seventh Lady.

277
00:14:26,831 --> 00:14:28,431
Seventh Lady.

278
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:40,027
Why is there a maid

279
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,199
peeking around?

280
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,521
What is she doing there?

281
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,279
She seems to be one of the maids
from Yining's abode.

282
00:14:45,311 --> 00:14:46,032
Rui Xiang,

283
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:47,607
bring her over

284
00:14:47,632 --> 00:14:48,752
for questioning.

285
00:14:48,992 --> 00:14:49,752
Yes.

286
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,401
You, come here.

287
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,720
Why are you running away?

288
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,401
Come with me.

289
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,841
What were you doing over there?

290
00:15:01,232 --> 00:15:02,311
Seventh Lady...

291
00:15:02,392 --> 00:15:04,551
Seventh Lady asked me to keep guard
at the entrance

292
00:15:04,632 --> 00:15:05,632
and notify her

293
00:15:05,711 --> 00:15:06,992
as soon as anyone came.

294
00:15:07,272 --> 00:15:08,752
What's that supposed to mean?

295
00:15:09,563 --> 00:15:11,642
Where is Seventh Lady?

296
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,441
She's inside there.

297
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,441
Seventh Lady is in there alone?

298
00:15:19,934 --> 00:15:20,853
And

299
00:15:21,373 --> 00:15:22,733
a man...

300
00:15:26,112 --> 00:15:26,951
Seventh Lady,

301
00:15:27,071 --> 00:15:28,431
I have missed you so much.

302
00:15:32,951 --> 00:15:34,671
This disgraceful girl!

303
00:15:34,697 --> 00:15:35,697
Come out!

304
00:15:39,574 --> 00:15:40,773
Why is it you?

305
00:15:43,773 --> 00:15:45,134
Who do you expect, Father?

306
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,460
Where is Yining?

307
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:54,481
Father.

308
00:15:57,587 --> 00:15:58,547
I am here.

309
00:16:00,472 --> 00:16:01,472
Did you ask for me?

310
00:16:03,657 --> 00:16:04,738
Yining,

311
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,440
are you all right?

312
00:16:07,992 --> 00:16:08,711
Grandma.

313
00:16:09,754 --> 00:16:10,515
Mother.

314
00:16:11,354 --> 00:16:12,354
I'm all right.

315
00:16:16,114 --> 00:16:17,954
This man knocked me out

316
00:16:17,979 --> 00:16:19,259
and brought me here.

317
00:16:19,675 --> 00:16:21,195
Fortunately, Shenyuan came in time

318
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,060
and saved me.

319
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:23,114
Seventh Lady,

320
00:16:23,171 --> 00:16:25,011
what are you talking about?

321
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:26,096
Didn't...

322
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,160
Didn't you ask to meet me here?

323
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,760
Isn't this the note

324
00:16:31,794 --> 00:16:33,034
your maid delivered?

325
00:16:35,795 --> 00:16:37,074
Seventh Lady ordered me

326
00:16:37,099 --> 00:16:38,859
to deliver it to this man.

327
00:16:43,555 --> 00:16:45,515
"I tie a love knot
with this silk waistband,

328
00:16:45,554 --> 00:16:48,355
carrying the warmth and fragrance.

329
00:16:49,474 --> 00:16:51,675
I wish to meet with you."

330
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:55,515
Yining,

331
00:16:56,114 --> 00:16:57,954
I recognize your handwriting.

332
00:16:58,354 --> 00:16:59,954
You wrote this.

333
00:17:00,587 --> 00:17:02,186
Is there anything you have to say?

334
00:17:03,234 --> 00:17:04,074
Father,

335
00:17:04,195 --> 00:17:06,155
handwriting may have been forged.

336
00:17:06,355 --> 00:17:07,234
Besides,

337
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,399
even though she serves in my abode,

338
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:10,954
she is not my handmaid.

339
00:17:11,123 --> 00:17:12,442
How could I possibly entrust her

340
00:17:12,554 --> 00:17:14,155
to a private matter like this?

341
00:17:14,514 --> 00:17:15,234
Exactly.

342
00:17:15,635 --> 00:17:17,514
Her handmaid should be Xue Zhi.

343
00:17:18,355 --> 00:17:19,034
Young Lady,

344
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,081
you said Xue Zhi

345
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:21,907
would draw attention,

346
00:17:22,195 --> 00:17:22,954
that's why

347
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:24,915
you picked a less familiar maid.

348
00:17:25,308 --> 00:17:26,308
By the way,

349
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,401
this is the token you gave me

350
00:17:29,426 --> 00:17:30,307
when we first met.

351
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,048
I have been carrying it
with me ever since.

352
00:17:35,355 --> 00:17:36,554
Isn't this the silk waistband

353
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:39,736
I gave your mother?

354
00:17:41,034 --> 00:17:42,954
I have seen this silk waistband before.

355
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:44,449
Yiyu and I

356
00:17:44,474 --> 00:17:46,274
found it in the yard.

357
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,921
Then, this man hurried over
and claimed it was his.

358
00:17:48,954 --> 00:17:49,994
He said

359
00:17:50,019 --> 00:17:52,440
it was given by someone very important.

360
00:17:52,963 --> 00:17:55,044
Yiyu can testify to this.

361
00:17:58,714 --> 00:17:59,835
I asked Song Zhi

362
00:18:00,155 --> 00:18:02,075
to wash this silk waistband,

363
00:18:02,274 --> 00:18:03,474
but then it disappeared.

364
00:18:03,595 --> 00:18:04,875
I was really upset.

365
00:18:04,994 --> 00:18:07,355
After all, this belongs to Mother.

366
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,101
Shut it.

367
00:18:08,835 --> 00:18:10,595
Shameless.

368
00:18:11,155 --> 00:18:13,195
You are just trying to deny it.

369
00:18:13,395 --> 00:18:14,234
Butler Bai.

370
00:18:14,474 --> 00:18:14,915
Yes.

371
00:18:14,994 --> 00:18:16,595
Lock Seventh Lady
and the performer up

372
00:18:16,675 --> 00:18:17,754
separately.

373
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:18,635
Enough.

374
00:18:23,195 --> 00:18:24,875
Let Yining finish.

375
00:18:26,195 --> 00:18:27,274
Thank you, Grandma.

376
00:18:32,635 --> 00:18:34,355
When did I give you this silk waistband?

377
00:18:34,435 --> 00:18:35,595
On that day,

378
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:37,120
someone intruded
on Yuanjiang Pavilion.

379
00:18:37,184 --> 00:18:39,280
You got lost, and I saved you.

380
00:18:39,474 --> 00:18:40,994
How did you save me?

381
00:18:41,155 --> 00:18:43,514
The weather was fine that day,

382
00:18:43,568 --> 00:18:45,630
and you were wearing
a pale yellow cloth jacket.

383
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,621
It was beautiful.

384
00:18:46,835 --> 00:18:48,474
You were grateful to me,

385
00:18:48,496 --> 00:18:49,910
and we fell in love at first sight.

386
00:18:50,034 --> 00:18:51,234
You gave me this silk waistband

387
00:18:51,277 --> 00:18:52,676
and made a lifelong promise.

388
00:18:52,735 --> 00:18:54,255
You told me to come here to find you.

389
00:18:55,115 --> 00:18:56,915
I saved Seventh Lady that day.

390
00:18:57,195 --> 00:18:58,554
I didn't see you there.

391
00:18:58,579 --> 00:19:00,539
Pale yellow cloth jacket?

392
00:19:09,474 --> 00:19:10,314
Third Master Luo,

393
00:19:10,339 --> 00:19:12,019
there's no need to help us hide it.

394
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:13,236
We met you

395
00:19:13,261 --> 00:19:14,180
the next morning.

396
00:19:14,256 --> 00:19:16,350
Seventh Lady told me
that you are her third brother

397
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,021
and would always cover for her.

398
00:19:18,195 --> 00:19:19,034
As of now,

399
00:19:19,059 --> 00:19:20,379
there's no need

400
00:19:20,714 --> 00:19:22,355
to hide our relationship anymore.

401
00:19:22,994 --> 00:19:24,794
Seventh Lady, trust me.

402
00:19:24,891 --> 00:19:26,290
I won't fail you.

403
00:19:28,915 --> 00:19:32,395
Mother, this is disgraceful!

404
00:19:33,915 --> 00:19:35,274
I'm going to beat you to death!

405
00:19:37,754 --> 00:19:38,754
Stop it!

406
00:19:44,107 --> 00:19:45,466
Can you think for a moment?

407
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:47,675
This matter seems suspicious.

408
00:19:47,731 --> 00:19:49,971
How could you beat her
without asking anything?

409
00:19:50,075 --> 00:19:51,075
Mother,

410
00:19:51,435 --> 00:19:53,075
the witness and the evidence are here.

411
00:19:53,171 --> 00:19:54,371
If we keep digging deeper,

412
00:19:54,474 --> 00:19:56,514
it will only disgrace us further.

413
00:19:58,714 --> 00:20:00,435
Where in Yuanjing Pavilion

414
00:20:01,274 --> 00:20:02,514
did you save her?

415
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:03,994
This was chaotic that day.

416
00:20:04,474 --> 00:20:06,115
How did you manage to get out?

417
00:20:08,595 --> 00:20:10,355
It was dark that day.

418
00:20:10,595 --> 00:20:13,075
I can't remember

419
00:20:13,915 --> 00:20:15,195
the exact place.

420
00:20:15,427 --> 00:20:16,148
Dark?

421
00:20:16,595 --> 00:20:18,714
You said the weather was nice.

422
00:20:18,794 --> 00:20:20,835
Also, you claimed

423
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:21,940
you saved me,

424
00:20:22,395 --> 00:20:24,435
but you never mentioned a word
about the accident

425
00:20:24,512 --> 00:20:26,580
at the peach blossom
forest in the north, and we stayed

426
00:20:26,608 --> 00:20:28,560
under the southern bridge
to shelter from the rain.

427
00:20:29,514 --> 00:20:30,474
Oh, right!

428
00:20:30,528 --> 00:20:32,010
I saved you at the peach blossom forest

429
00:20:32,234 --> 00:20:34,314
and took you to hide under the bridge
in the south.

430
00:20:34,403 --> 00:20:35,284
Your clothes

431
00:20:35,474 --> 00:20:37,155
were soaked,

432
00:20:37,274 --> 00:20:38,034
so I built a fire

433
00:20:38,059 --> 00:20:39,178
to dry them.

434
00:20:39,514 --> 00:20:41,075
You appreciated my gentlemanly behavior

435
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,420
and wanted to marry me.

436
00:20:43,195 --> 00:20:45,355
That's why you gave me
this silk waistband.

437
00:20:47,115 --> 00:20:49,595
To the north of Yuanjing Pavilion
is Bian River,

438
00:20:49,619 --> 00:20:51,500
not the peach blossom forest.

439
00:20:53,274 --> 00:20:54,875
The peach blossom forest
is in the south.

440
00:20:54,899 --> 00:20:56,100
There's no bridge there.

441
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:58,395
Besides, it wasn't raining that day.

442
00:20:58,514 --> 00:20:59,754
You jester

443
00:20:59,779 --> 00:21:01,418
surely have a way

444
00:21:01,571 --> 00:21:02,970
of spinning tall tales.

445
00:21:06,234 --> 00:21:07,075
Own up.

446
00:21:08,109 --> 00:21:09,869
Who instructed you
to frame Seventh Lady?

447
00:21:10,595 --> 00:21:11,195
I...

448
00:21:12,274 --> 00:21:14,435
It was my first time
at Yuanjing Pavilion.

449
00:21:14,675 --> 00:21:15,994
Plus, it was chaotic that day.

450
00:21:16,274 --> 00:21:18,075
I can't remember clearly.

451
00:21:18,635 --> 00:21:19,595
But this silk waistband

452
00:21:19,714 --> 00:21:21,875
was indeed given by Seventh Lady.

453
00:21:23,794 --> 00:21:26,034
Father, this silk waistband

454
00:21:26,115 --> 00:21:28,380
isn't the one you gave to my mother.

455
00:21:29,274 --> 00:21:30,595
Take a closer look.

456
00:21:35,595 --> 00:21:37,274
I ordered two different silk waistbands

457
00:21:37,299 --> 00:21:38,898
for the principal wife
and the concubine.

458
00:21:39,195 --> 00:21:40,514
The one for your mother

459
00:21:40,675 --> 00:21:42,195
had seven-petaled orchids,

460
00:21:42,675 --> 00:21:44,234
while the one for Yuechan

461
00:21:49,754 --> 00:21:51,514
had six-petaled orchids...

462
00:22:04,274 --> 00:22:05,234
Is this

463
00:22:06,115 --> 00:22:07,554
mine?

464
00:22:11,754 --> 00:22:12,754
This is impossible.

465
00:22:12,954 --> 00:22:14,714
How could it be mine?

466
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,160
Someone must have stolen it.

467
00:22:17,514 --> 00:22:18,155
Second Master,

468
00:22:18,274 --> 00:22:20,075
please seek justice for me.

469
00:22:20,195 --> 00:22:22,635
I thought someone wanted to
frame Seventh Lady.

470
00:22:22,699 --> 00:22:23,540
Yet,

471
00:22:24,034 --> 00:22:26,115
I'm being suspected instead.

472
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:28,355
Right, Father.

473
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,199
Yiyu and I

474
00:22:30,395 --> 00:22:31,915
saw seven-petaled orchids.

475
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:32,961
Yiyu also said

476
00:22:33,001 --> 00:22:34,402
the orchid embroidery is intricate.

477
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:35,230
If you don't believe,

478
00:22:35,234 --> 00:22:37,395
you can ask her yourself.

479
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,079
Bulter Bai.

480
00:22:42,474 --> 00:22:43,034
Yes.

481
00:22:43,731 --> 00:22:45,572
Fetch First Lady here.

482
00:22:45,835 --> 00:22:47,395
Tell Mr. Cheng...

483
00:22:47,994 --> 00:22:49,115
Tell him...

484
00:22:51,554 --> 00:22:52,915
What can you tell him?

485
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,560
What is there to say?

486
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,920
Tell him I'm sick again,

487
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,119
the banquet is postponed,

488
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:02,465
and apologize to him.

489
00:23:03,635 --> 00:23:04,274
Yes.

490
00:23:04,395 --> 00:23:05,155
Yes.

491
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,520
Madam,

492
00:23:23,754 --> 00:23:24,915
Old Madam is sick,

493
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,300
and the banquet is postponed.

494
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:30,300
All right.

495
00:23:35,195 --> 00:23:36,355
Mr. Cheng,

496
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:39,280
Old Madam suddenly falls sick.

497
00:23:39,635 --> 00:23:41,875
I'm afraid this banquet
will have to be another day.

498
00:23:41,954 --> 00:23:43,034
I'm truly sorry.

499
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,540
Is Old Madam's condition serious?

500
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,830
I should go and visit her.

501
00:23:46,075 --> 00:23:47,635
Don't trouble yourself, Mr. Cheng.

502
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:50,206
Right now, her courtyard
must be full of people.

503
00:23:50,474 --> 00:23:52,195
I must hurry back to serve her.

504
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:53,835
In that case,

505
00:23:54,234 --> 00:23:55,875
I won't disturb you any longer.

506
00:23:55,994 --> 00:23:57,314
I will take my leave today.

507
00:23:57,675 --> 00:24:00,435
Please send my regards to her,
Madam Chen.

508
00:24:01,234 --> 00:24:02,554
Thank you, Mr. Cheng.

509
00:24:03,234 --> 00:24:03,875
Xiu,

510
00:24:03,939 --> 00:24:05,659
return to the abode with Shan.

511
00:24:06,274 --> 00:24:07,395
I want to go, too.

512
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:10,635
Let's go.

513
00:24:33,595 --> 00:24:34,395
Mother,

514
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:37,120
why do you send for us?

515
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,120
I have something to ask Yiyu.

516
00:24:45,155 --> 00:24:46,075
Yiyu,

517
00:24:46,395 --> 00:24:47,949
do you remember

518
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:49,600
that we found a silk waistband
while we were

519
00:24:49,605 --> 00:24:51,165
taking a walk in the yard
a few days ago,

520
00:24:51,395 --> 00:24:53,875
and we returned it
to Lian Qing afterward?

521
00:24:56,514 --> 00:24:57,554
I do.

522
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:59,994
We were discussing
the orchid embroidery on the waistband.

523
00:25:00,115 --> 00:25:01,675
You should remember

524
00:25:02,124 --> 00:25:04,163
it was a seven-petaled orchid.

525
00:25:19,314 --> 00:25:21,714
I only remember it was an orchid,

526
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:23,650
but I have forgotten how many petals.

527
00:25:32,619 --> 00:25:33,258
My dear,

528
00:25:33,435 --> 00:25:35,274
I'm innocent.

529
00:25:35,554 --> 00:25:37,474
I don't know this performer.

530
00:25:38,115 --> 00:25:39,554
How...

531
00:25:39,714 --> 00:25:41,274
How is this possible?

532
00:25:41,299 --> 00:25:42,858
The handwriting on the note

533
00:25:43,034 --> 00:25:44,554
belongs to Yining.

534
00:25:44,579 --> 00:25:45,779
How do you explain this?

535
00:25:45,915 --> 00:25:46,915
Enough.

536
00:25:47,954 --> 00:25:49,835
Return to your abodes.

537
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,741
Don't come out without my permission.

538
00:25:53,954 --> 00:25:57,314
As for this performer...

539
00:25:57,364 --> 00:25:58,683
Let's report it to the yamen.

540
00:26:00,835 --> 00:26:03,714
Let the officials interrogate him.

541
00:26:03,835 --> 00:26:05,595
He will definitely confess.

542
00:26:05,915 --> 00:26:07,514
This is shameful.

543
00:26:07,539 --> 00:26:08,738
Don't report it to the yamen.

544
00:26:08,994 --> 00:26:10,754
Do you mean

545
00:26:11,314 --> 00:26:12,314
we won't interrogate him?

546
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,160
How can it be?

547
00:26:16,234 --> 00:26:18,474
We must clear Yining's name.

548
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,599
You can't put it that way, Madam Lin.

549
00:26:23,624 --> 00:26:25,104
This matter is unsolved.

550
00:26:25,274 --> 00:26:27,675
I'm innocent, too.

551
00:26:30,754 --> 00:26:32,155
Let me think.

552
00:26:32,994 --> 00:26:33,954
Butler Bai.

553
00:26:34,195 --> 00:26:34,794
Yes.

554
00:26:35,034 --> 00:26:37,115
Lock this performer up in the woodshed.

555
00:26:37,355 --> 00:26:37,915
Yes.

556
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:38,719
Father,

557
00:26:39,034 --> 00:26:41,034
I will bring Mother back
to her room first.

558
00:26:41,835 --> 00:26:42,635
Stand right there.

559
00:26:47,115 --> 00:26:49,514
Father, if you find this confusing,

560
00:26:49,595 --> 00:26:51,155
let me help you.

561
00:26:52,754 --> 00:26:53,635
Qing Qu.

562
00:27:00,282 --> 00:27:02,522
Father, this is Chen Si,

563
00:27:02,835 --> 00:27:04,155
who serves Fifth Master Qiao.

564
00:27:04,274 --> 00:27:06,610
He's also the son of Ms. Lyu,

565
00:27:06,635 --> 00:27:07,754
who used to serve in Muxi Hall.

566
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,000
That day at Jingyuan Pavilion,

567
00:27:09,435 --> 00:27:11,115
he was chasing after me with a knife.

568
00:27:11,991 --> 00:27:13,390
It was Fifth Master Qiao's order.

569
00:27:13,552 --> 00:27:15,070
We followed Mistress Qiao's instruction

570
00:27:15,195 --> 00:27:16,595
to capture Seventh Lady.

571
00:27:16,675 --> 00:27:17,789
As for my mother,

572
00:27:17,790 --> 00:27:19,710
it was Mistress Qiao
who gave her the bag of silver

573
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:20,896
to trick the maid into gossiping.

574
00:27:20,915 --> 00:27:22,234
I didn't do anything else.

575
00:27:22,314 --> 00:27:23,915
Please spare me, Second Master Luo!

576
00:27:25,914 --> 00:27:27,115
Don't you slander me!

577
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:28,340
Do you have evidence?

578
00:27:28,635 --> 00:27:30,794
Here's the letter from Fifth Master Qiao

579
00:27:30,875 --> 00:27:32,595
to run errands for Mistress Qiao.

580
00:27:33,915 --> 00:27:35,554
You can compare the handwriting

581
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,274
with Fifth Master Qiao's
previous letter.

582
00:27:37,474 --> 00:27:38,875
Handwriting can be forged.

583
00:27:39,075 --> 00:27:40,715
Who knows if you brided someone

584
00:27:40,805 --> 00:27:42,285
to frame my mother?

585
00:27:42,635 --> 00:27:44,355
Now you know

586
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:45,979
handwriting can be forged.

587
00:27:46,241 --> 00:27:47,241
Chengzhang,

588
00:27:47,554 --> 00:27:48,915
at this rate,

589
00:27:49,111 --> 00:27:51,512
we must get to the bottom of this.

590
00:27:51,915 --> 00:27:54,115
Don't cover it up again.

591
00:28:02,474 --> 00:28:04,514
As you say, Mother.

592
00:28:16,355 --> 00:28:17,954
Open the Ancestral Shrine.

593
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:23,635
Mother,

594
00:28:23,754 --> 00:28:25,754
I will bring Yiyu back first.

595
00:28:28,435 --> 00:28:29,195
My dear.

596
00:28:36,075 --> 00:28:37,075
Shenyuan.

597
00:28:39,435 --> 00:28:40,195
Thank you so much.

598
00:28:42,314 --> 00:28:43,314
Seventh Lady.

599
00:28:47,034 --> 00:28:48,034
Seventh Lady.

600
00:28:57,835 --> 00:28:59,915
Seventh Lady!

601
00:29:01,355 --> 00:29:02,554
Where are you, Seventh Lady?

602
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,199
What is this?

603
00:29:03,514 --> 00:29:04,195
Seventh Lady!

604
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,664
I want to swap this silk waistband.

605
00:29:07,474 --> 00:29:08,314
Seventh Lady.

606
00:29:09,155 --> 00:29:10,115
Seventh Lady?

607
00:29:11,195 --> 00:29:12,034
Seventh Lady.

608
00:29:14,314 --> 00:29:16,435
You like playing games, Seventh Lady.

609
00:29:16,635 --> 00:29:17,474
Seventh Lady.

610
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,801
Seventh Lady.

611
00:29:21,875 --> 00:29:22,754
Seventh Lady.

612
00:29:23,635 --> 00:29:24,635
Seventh Lady.

613
00:29:24,794 --> 00:29:26,635
I touched your hand.

614
00:29:27,155 --> 00:29:27,994
Seventh Lady.

615
00:29:43,994 --> 00:29:46,714
Mother, I didn't mean to...

616
00:29:46,954 --> 00:29:47,754
Yu,

617
00:29:48,435 --> 00:29:50,835
you did very well.

618
00:29:51,635 --> 00:29:54,034
We should try to avoid

619
00:29:54,059 --> 00:29:56,619
getting involved
in their family matters.

620
00:29:58,514 --> 00:29:59,875
You are indeed

621
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,480
my most sensible child.

622
00:30:02,768 --> 00:30:04,688
You didn't disappoint me.

623
00:30:05,132 --> 00:30:05,772
Yes,

624
00:30:06,034 --> 00:30:07,994
I will remember your teachings.

625
00:30:11,035 --> 00:30:12,155
Are you saying

626
00:30:12,395 --> 00:30:14,915
that Third Young Master Luo,
who looks like a gardener,

627
00:30:15,395 --> 00:30:16,554
might be the one going up

628
00:30:16,579 --> 00:30:17,898
against Uncle in Yuanjing Pavilion?

629
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:19,456
On the night at Yuanjing Pavilion,

630
00:30:19,459 --> 00:30:20,899
there was a man and a woman.

631
00:30:21,115 --> 00:30:24,115
That woman was wearing
a pale yellow coat.

632
00:30:27,514 --> 00:30:28,314
I will head back

633
00:30:29,034 --> 00:30:30,979
and report this to Uncle first.

634
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,635
(Luo Clan Ancestral Shrine)

635
00:30:36,372 --> 00:30:37,532
Qiao Yuechen,

636
00:30:39,234 --> 00:30:40,754
over the years,

637
00:30:40,754 --> 00:30:43,075
I appreciate that you gave birth

638
00:30:43,274 --> 00:30:45,115
to a pair of children
for the Luo Family.

639
00:30:45,514 --> 00:30:48,861
Hence, I have been lenient with you.

640
00:30:49,835 --> 00:30:52,034
But I have never expected you

641
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:55,380
to commit such evil acts.

642
00:30:55,790 --> 00:30:57,830
You harmed your mother-in-law,

643
00:30:58,234 --> 00:31:00,875
attempted to assassinate the legitimate
daughter in Yuanjing Pavilion,

644
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:04,075
and now you have even tried
to ruin her reputation.

645
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,399
Do you plead guilty?

646
00:31:08,794 --> 00:31:09,754
Old Madam,

647
00:31:10,314 --> 00:31:11,514
Chen Si claimed

648
00:31:11,875 --> 00:31:14,675
that Fifth Master Qiao gave him orders.

649
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,460
But that's only his side of the story.

650
00:31:16,571 --> 00:31:18,730
Fifth Master Qiao isn't here.

651
00:31:19,314 --> 00:31:21,395
Does Chen Si dare to confront him?

652
00:31:25,234 --> 00:31:25,835
Father,

653
00:31:26,115 --> 00:31:28,474
Mother has served you
wholeheartedly all these years.

654
00:31:28,635 --> 00:31:29,915
She wouldn't do that.

655
00:31:30,234 --> 00:31:31,115
Father,

656
00:31:31,234 --> 00:31:33,355
Mother only cares about

657
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,420
whether you are cold

658
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,440
or hungry every day.

659
00:31:35,754 --> 00:31:37,595
All she cares about is you.

660
00:31:46,675 --> 00:31:47,635
Mother,

661
00:31:49,714 --> 00:31:52,355
Yuechan does have a point.

662
00:31:52,595 --> 00:31:54,195
We can summon Fifth Master Qiao here

663
00:31:54,474 --> 00:31:56,994
and let them confront each other.

664
00:32:05,274 --> 00:32:06,435
Yuechan, you...

665
00:32:13,435 --> 00:32:14,274
Butler Bai.

666
00:32:14,595 --> 00:32:15,115
Yes.

667
00:32:15,275 --> 00:32:16,356
Summon a physician.

668
00:32:16,635 --> 00:32:17,195
Yes.

669
00:32:17,344 --> 00:32:18,104
Father,

670
00:32:18,915 --> 00:32:19,954
no rush.

671
00:32:20,595 --> 00:32:22,954
The physician is already on his way.

672
00:32:26,115 --> 00:32:27,075
The physician is here.

673
00:32:34,075 --> 00:32:35,395
Physician Chen?

674
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,560
I'm Meng Hetang.

675
00:32:44,595 --> 00:32:46,075
Greetings, Old Madam Luo.

676
00:32:46,835 --> 00:32:48,675
Greetings, Second Master Luo.

677
00:32:49,395 --> 00:32:51,234
We haven't met for more than a decade,

678
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,350
but you still remember me,
Second Master Luo.

679
00:32:53,954 --> 00:32:55,994
Aren't you Physician Chen?

680
00:32:56,355 --> 00:32:58,075
Why is your surname Meng?

681
00:32:58,554 --> 00:33:00,474
Well, it's a shame.

682
00:33:00,737 --> 00:33:03,417
My surname is Meng,
and I'm from Yangzhou.

683
00:33:03,794 --> 00:33:04,714
However,

684
00:33:05,355 --> 00:33:07,835
Mistress Qiao intended to hide the fact

685
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:09,851
that we were acquaintances,

686
00:33:10,115 --> 00:33:12,034
so I went by the surname Chen.

687
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,670
Please don't be angry,
Second Master.

688
00:33:13,954 --> 00:33:15,595
I did go to Yangzhou

689
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,581
to seek his treatment

690
00:33:16,835 --> 00:33:18,595
because I trusted his healing skills.

691
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:20,459
I'm concerned it may
raise unnecessary suspicions

692
00:33:20,484 --> 00:33:22,714
about me summoning a physician
from Yangzhou,

693
00:33:23,115 --> 00:33:24,635
so I asked him
to change his surname.

694
00:33:29,835 --> 00:33:31,435
I have come to the capital several times

695
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:33,021
and helped Mistress Qiao

696
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,560
while she was bearing her two children.

697
00:33:34,714 --> 00:33:35,915
But once,

698
00:33:36,155 --> 00:33:38,075
she was overly distressed

699
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,459
that it affected the fetus.

700
00:33:39,875 --> 00:33:42,274
Even though I did my best,

701
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:44,155
I couldn't save it.

702
00:33:44,554 --> 00:33:45,435
Mistress Qiao

703
00:33:45,554 --> 00:33:47,714
tried to hush me up,

704
00:33:48,034 --> 00:33:49,635
she personally bought me

705
00:33:49,714 --> 00:33:50,994
a house.

706
00:33:52,034 --> 00:33:54,435
I wasn't thinking straight at that time

707
00:33:55,314 --> 00:33:57,075
and followed her order

708
00:33:57,274 --> 00:33:58,314
to accuse Seventh Lady

709
00:34:00,954 --> 00:34:02,754
of causing her miscarriage.

710
00:34:03,314 --> 00:34:06,034
I'm truly sorry, Seventh Lady.

711
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:10,799
Well, well. Qiao Yuechan.

712
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,479
You failed to keep your child,

713
00:34:13,515 --> 00:34:15,274
and you blamed it

714
00:34:15,394 --> 00:34:17,314
on a little girl.

715
00:34:17,394 --> 00:34:19,714
You are truly wicked.

716
00:34:19,834 --> 00:34:23,234
Poor Yining was sent to the side yard

717
00:34:23,259 --> 00:34:24,900
and has lived there
for more than a decade.

718
00:34:25,115 --> 00:34:26,914
All because of you.

719
00:34:27,035 --> 00:34:28,234
Slander!

720
00:34:28,955 --> 00:34:30,555
You are slandering me!

721
00:34:33,914 --> 00:34:35,675
You claim I gave you a house.

722
00:34:36,515 --> 00:34:37,914
Where is the evidence?

723
00:34:42,675 --> 00:34:44,234
I have the house deed.

724
00:34:44,555 --> 00:34:46,714
Even handwriting can be forged,

725
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:48,714
let alone a house deed.

726
00:34:48,914 --> 00:34:50,595
You gave me this with your own hand.

727
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:51,941
How could it be fake?

728
00:35:11,376 --> 00:35:13,159
This house deed states
it was the fifth day

729
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,790
of the fourth month
in the year of Gengzi.

730
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,240
On that day, Lian was gravely ill.

731
00:35:17,794 --> 00:35:19,995
I went to a temple
to pray for her well-being.

732
00:35:20,515 --> 00:35:22,714
Chengzhang was concerned
about the baby in my belly,

733
00:35:22,834 --> 00:35:24,555
so he accompanied me to the temple.

734
00:35:26,274 --> 00:35:27,555
I remember.

735
00:35:27,664 --> 00:35:29,150
That day was Lixia.
[*Start of Summer]

736
00:35:29,234 --> 00:35:30,794
It was the fifth day
of the fourth month.

737
00:35:31,874 --> 00:35:33,914
You said if the baby was born,

738
00:35:33,939 --> 00:35:35,418
we could name it "Xia".

739
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:38,274
Thankfully, you remember that.

740
00:35:38,448 --> 00:35:40,595
Otherwise, I would've been framed.

741
00:35:40,754 --> 00:35:42,834
Ironically, the person
who forged this deed

742
00:35:42,914 --> 00:35:44,834
created a double of me
to personally hand it over

743
00:35:44,859 --> 00:35:46,579
to Meng Hetang.

744
00:35:50,834 --> 00:35:51,834
What I said earlier

745
00:35:53,995 --> 00:35:56,595
was Seventh Lady's order.

746
00:35:56,794 --> 00:35:59,394
She gave me that house

747
00:36:00,354 --> 00:36:02,434
and forced me to make up a story

748
00:36:02,515 --> 00:36:05,555
to frame Mistress Qiao.

749
00:36:07,394 --> 00:36:09,475
Seventh Lady, you are really something.

750
00:36:09,754 --> 00:36:12,195
You are trying to destroy me.

751
00:36:12,434 --> 00:36:14,754
I treated you like my own child,

752
00:36:14,779 --> 00:36:16,179
better than Lian.

753
00:36:16,434 --> 00:36:18,394
Why do you want to frame me?

754
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:21,754
Physician Meng,

755
00:36:22,675 --> 00:36:24,834
no matter what someone has done wrong,

756
00:36:24,928 --> 00:36:26,910
their family shouldn't
be dragged into the mess.

757
00:36:28,155 --> 00:36:30,075
Do you want to go down the wrong road?

758
00:36:32,874 --> 00:36:33,955
Seventh Lady,

759
00:36:34,195 --> 00:36:35,635
besides bringing the physician here,

760
00:36:35,794 --> 00:36:38,155
did you also threaten his family?

761
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:38,981
Bribe?

762
00:36:39,274 --> 00:36:40,234
Threaten?

763
00:36:40,354 --> 00:36:41,274
Use?

764
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,920
Aren't those

765
00:36:42,938 --> 00:36:44,458
your favorite tricks, Mistress Qiao?

766
00:36:47,195 --> 00:36:48,035
Qing Qu.

767
00:36:56,635 --> 00:36:58,675
Young Master, your wound is bleeding.

768
00:36:58,754 --> 00:37:00,555
It will be troublesome
if someone finds out.

769
00:37:01,616 --> 00:37:04,208
Did the Zhang brothers hand over
the people they rescued to Qing Qu?

770
00:37:04,234 --> 00:37:06,195
They did, along with Fifth Master Qiao.

771
00:37:06,394 --> 00:37:08,195
Young Master,
Seventh Lady can manage.

772
00:37:08,274 --> 00:37:09,515
We should go back now.

773
00:37:09,555 --> 00:37:10,874
She can manage?

774
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:12,889
The way she did it

775
00:37:12,914 --> 00:37:14,729
even landed herself in big trouble.

776
00:37:14,754 --> 00:37:16,035
Young Master, calm down.

777
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,440
Your wound will bleed even more.

778
00:37:17,675 --> 00:37:18,314
I'm fine.

779
00:37:19,515 --> 00:37:21,555
Young Master, are you all right?

780
00:37:30,394 --> 00:37:30,995
Yuechan,

781
00:37:31,914 --> 00:37:32,955
please don't blame me.

782
00:37:33,195 --> 00:37:35,394
I can't hide it anymore.

783
00:37:35,515 --> 00:37:36,035
I...

784
00:37:36,595 --> 00:37:37,874
I confessed everything.

785
00:37:41,035 --> 00:37:41,834
Second Master.

786
00:37:42,834 --> 00:37:43,635
Old Madam.

787
00:37:43,714 --> 00:37:45,314
It's my fault. Please spare me.

788
00:37:45,434 --> 00:37:47,075
Please spare me. It's my fault.

789
00:37:47,155 --> 00:37:47,955
Old Madam,

790
00:37:48,234 --> 00:37:49,515
this man is Fifth Master Qiao.

791
00:37:49,635 --> 00:37:51,035
Mistress Qiao instructed him

792
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,199
to capture Physician Meng,

793
00:37:52,434 --> 00:37:54,195
but I rescued him,

794
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:56,714
so he captured his wife and daughter
from his hometown.

795
00:37:56,736 --> 00:37:58,400
After Physician Meng
arrived in the capital,

796
00:37:58,448 --> 00:38:00,270
Fifth Master Qiao threatened him

797
00:38:00,299 --> 00:38:01,540
to falsely accuse

798
00:38:01,636 --> 00:38:03,156
Seventh Lady.

799
00:38:03,754 --> 00:38:05,995
I have Fifth Master Qiao's statement

800
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:07,754
and the letters

801
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:09,312
Mistress Qiao wrote to give him orders.

802
00:38:13,834 --> 00:38:14,635
And this woman, too.

803
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,274
This is Ms. Li
from Mistress Qiao's abode.

804
00:38:17,595 --> 00:38:18,834
She can testify

805
00:38:18,859 --> 00:38:20,099
to the crime

806
00:38:20,112 --> 00:38:21,420
Mistress Qiao committed back then.

807
00:38:21,914 --> 00:38:22,834
Ms. Li,

808
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,430
didn't you fall sick
and return to your hometown?

809
00:38:26,314 --> 00:38:27,394
Madam Lin,

810
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:28,650
I'm fully aware of

811
00:38:28,675 --> 00:38:30,434
all the evildoings Mistress Qiao did

812
00:38:30,555 --> 00:38:32,834
to Seventh Lady and Madam Gu.

813
00:38:33,155 --> 00:38:35,010
She feared that once I left her abode,

814
00:38:35,035 --> 00:38:36,035
I would expose her secrets,

815
00:38:36,434 --> 00:38:38,635
so she forced me to leave

816
00:38:38,874 --> 00:38:41,234
and tried to kill me on the way.

817
00:38:41,754 --> 00:38:43,995
Fortunately, Ms. Qing Qu saved my life.

818
00:38:45,035 --> 00:38:45,515
Let's go.

819
00:38:46,075 --> 00:38:47,595
I'm willing to testify.

820
00:38:58,675 --> 00:38:59,675
Physician Meng,

821
00:39:00,354 --> 00:39:01,515
after all this,

822
00:39:01,955 --> 00:39:03,714
are you still not telling the truth?

823
00:39:10,394 --> 00:39:11,195
Back then,

824
00:39:11,995 --> 00:39:13,075
Mistress Qiao

825
00:39:13,139 --> 00:39:15,020
asked me for a medical record.

826
00:39:15,408 --> 00:39:16,888
There was a prescription

827
00:39:17,195 --> 00:39:19,595
to falsify miscarriage symptoms

828
00:39:19,794 --> 00:39:21,714
without truly hurting the fetus.

829
00:39:21,834 --> 00:39:22,595
I found out about it

830
00:39:22,714 --> 00:39:25,475
only after checking
the herbal dregs.

831
00:39:25,995 --> 00:39:28,314
But Madam Gu had left the residence,

832
00:39:28,675 --> 00:39:31,834
so I didn't say anything.

833
00:39:40,475 --> 00:39:42,234
Did you falsely accuse Minglan

834
00:39:43,169 --> 00:39:45,049
of endangering your baby?

835
00:39:45,914 --> 00:39:46,834
I mentioned

836
00:39:46,914 --> 00:39:49,475
that Mistress Qiao used the miscarriage
to frame Seventh Lady

837
00:39:49,794 --> 00:39:51,995
when she heard she might lose her baby,

838
00:39:52,115 --> 00:39:53,314
and that was true as well.

839
00:39:54,234 --> 00:39:55,675
These house deeds

840
00:39:55,874 --> 00:39:58,314
were also forged by her.

841
00:39:58,578 --> 00:40:00,418
Fifth Master Qiao captured my family

842
00:40:00,595 --> 00:40:02,874
and threatened me
to slander Seventh Lady

843
00:40:02,899 --> 00:40:04,338
with these deeds.

844
00:40:04,675 --> 00:40:06,995
I had no choice.

845
00:40:08,834 --> 00:40:09,394
Young Master,

846
00:40:09,434 --> 00:40:10,834
now you can rest easy.

847
00:40:10,955 --> 00:40:12,754
You did everything in your power

848
00:40:12,779 --> 00:40:14,020
to help Seventh Lady.

849
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:17,190
Young Master.

850
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:20,521
- Young Master, let's head back.
- All right.

851
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:22,394
Let's go.

852
00:40:25,035 --> 00:40:25,555
Careful.

853
00:40:32,314 --> 00:40:33,354
Luo Yining,

854
00:40:34,635 --> 00:40:36,635
you have been waiting for this moment

855
00:40:36,874 --> 00:40:39,155
since the day you arrived.

856
00:40:40,475 --> 00:40:42,394
You get what you want now.

857
00:40:44,354 --> 00:40:45,475
Mistress Qiao,

858
00:40:46,392 --> 00:40:49,113
I should be the one asking that.

859
00:40:49,834 --> 00:40:51,274
Ever since I came here,

860
00:40:51,302 --> 00:40:52,754
you have been plotting against me.

861
00:40:53,434 --> 00:40:54,675
Unexpectedly,

862
00:40:54,834 --> 00:40:57,595
you ended up shooting yourself
in the foot.

863
00:40:57,914 --> 00:40:59,794
I'm not as cunning as you.

864
00:41:00,234 --> 00:41:02,274
You exploit your privilege
as the legitimate daughter

865
00:41:02,299 --> 00:41:03,540
of the Luo Family.

866
00:41:04,075 --> 00:41:05,555
But still, I'm nothing

867
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,619
compared to your cruelty.

868
00:41:07,234 --> 00:41:08,914
You framed my mother before

869
00:41:09,155 --> 00:41:10,595
and now me.

870
00:41:11,434 --> 00:41:12,995
All of this

871
00:41:13,434 --> 00:41:15,475
is of your own making.

872
00:41:19,955 --> 00:41:21,675
Did you bride

873
00:41:22,595 --> 00:41:24,394
the performer

874
00:41:25,754 --> 00:41:27,635
to ruin Yining's reputation?

875
00:41:31,754 --> 00:41:32,515
Yes, I did.

876
00:41:43,675 --> 00:41:44,555
Yuechan,

877
00:41:47,075 --> 00:41:49,314
ever since we met,

878
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:51,568
you have always been understanding

879
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:52,690
and decent.

880
00:41:54,714 --> 00:41:56,914
I saw you as a kindred soul.

881
00:41:59,234 --> 00:42:00,427
But why have you...

882
00:42:01,874 --> 00:42:04,595
Why have you become so vicious?

883
00:42:05,515 --> 00:42:06,714
Just why?

884
00:42:08,035 --> 00:42:09,354
All these years, I've given you

885
00:42:09,995 --> 00:42:11,914
monetary support
and respect as much as I could.

886
00:42:11,939 --> 00:42:14,338
I have treated you fairly.

887
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:18,195
Why are you silent?

888
00:42:19,635 --> 00:42:20,834
Answer me.

889
00:42:22,354 --> 00:42:24,075
Answer me.

890
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:45,800
What more

891
00:42:46,955 --> 00:42:48,555
can I say?

892
00:42:49,274 --> 00:42:52,434
What can I say to you?

893
00:42:56,075 --> 00:42:58,959
You promised to marry me
as your principal wife,

894
00:42:59,595 --> 00:43:01,555
but instead, you married Gu Minglan.

895
00:43:02,675 --> 00:43:03,761
I don't know

896
00:43:03,786 --> 00:43:06,027
what makes me inferior to her.

897
00:43:06,754 --> 00:43:08,274
Is it because

898
00:43:08,299 --> 00:43:09,819
I'm an illegitimate daughter?

899
00:43:09,995 --> 00:43:11,314
Please tell me.

900
00:43:11,434 --> 00:43:14,115
I still can't understand even now.

901
00:43:15,274 --> 00:43:16,754
Is status

902
00:43:17,234 --> 00:43:18,475
the only reason

903
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,601
you were with me?

904
00:43:20,816 --> 00:43:22,470
I swallowed my pride
to become a concubine.

905
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,820
I wanted to drive Gu Minglan away,

906
00:43:25,874 --> 00:43:28,035
but then you married Lin Hairu.

907
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,280
She comes from a wealthy family.

908
00:43:30,307 --> 00:43:32,108
How could I ever compete with that?

909
00:43:35,874 --> 00:43:36,754
I deserve this.

910
00:43:39,635 --> 00:43:41,195
I have done the wrong things.

911
00:43:42,155 --> 00:43:44,834
As terribly wrong as I may have been,

912
00:43:46,155 --> 00:43:48,874
I still gave birth
to a pair of children for you.

913
00:43:49,076 --> 00:43:51,635
All I care about and think of

914
00:43:51,995 --> 00:43:53,354
is only you.

915
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:56,195
I have given my whole life
to my children,

916
00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:57,901
and I have no complaints.

917
00:43:57,965 --> 00:43:59,525
I only want my children

918
00:43:59,675 --> 00:44:01,396
to make the Luo Family proud.

919
00:44:01,421 --> 00:44:02,620
Do you understand?

920
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:05,376
I have always wanted the best in life.

921
00:44:06,112 --> 00:44:07,752
I have made mistakes,

922
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:09,239
and I lost,

923
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:12,041
but my children must not lose.

924
00:44:12,995 --> 00:44:13,914
Luo Chengzhang,

925
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:16,629
our children must not lose.

926
00:44:29,675 --> 00:44:30,995
You have done it all wrong.

927
00:44:33,195 --> 00:44:34,475
