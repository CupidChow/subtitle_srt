(Adapted from Wen Tan's novel "Chancellor
Training Handbook" from Jinjiang Literature)

00:01:36,642 --> 00:01:38,767
=Episode 4=

4
00:01:40,072 --> 00:01:42,814
(Luo's Residence)

5
00:01:49,447 --> 00:01:51,447
Young Master, is that painting
with the evidence

6
00:01:51,567 --> 00:01:52,727
not even here?

7
00:02:19,448 --> 00:02:21,568
Young Master, even though
Seventh Lady isn't here,

8
00:02:21,593 --> 00:02:23,073
Haitang Abode is still quite lively.

9
00:02:23,424 --> 00:02:24,328
Go and check it out.

10
00:02:24,687 --> 00:02:25,328
Alright.

11
00:02:31,104 --> 00:02:32,840
It's late at night.
What are you doing here?

12
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,096
I'm not doing anything.

13
00:02:34,096 --> 00:02:36,060
I saw you coming,
so I thought I'd play a little joke.

14
00:02:36,352 --> 00:02:38,760
It's already late now.
Ms. Ying, what are you doing here?

15
00:02:39,168 --> 00:02:40,768
I... I...

16
00:02:41,127 --> 00:02:42,608
Young Lady is hungry.

17
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,848
So, I'm going to the kitchen
to get some midnight snack.

18
00:02:45,967 --> 00:02:47,288
Why do I need to tell you, anyway?

19
00:02:56,048 --> 00:02:56,647
Young Lady,

20
00:02:56,927 --> 00:02:59,328
why did you suddenly decide
to learn bookkeeping?

21
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,168
Madam Lin is good at doing
business and bookkeeping.

22
00:03:03,568 --> 00:03:05,127
Getting along with
such a great teacher,

23
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:06,471
I can acquire more skills,

24
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,696
which is also a good thing.

25
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,190
Who knows, maybe I'll be
a shopkeeper in the future

26
00:03:10,215 --> 00:03:11,294
and manage my own shop.

27
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,720
The Luo family is
wealthy and prosperous.

28
00:03:13,745 --> 00:03:16,168
How could Young Lady possibly need
to go out and earn money?

29
00:03:16,208 --> 00:03:17,728
Everything in this world is impermanent.

30
00:03:17,728 --> 00:03:18,768
As a woman,

31
00:03:18,888 --> 00:03:20,847
it's better for us to equip ourselves.

32
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:24,247
You must be tired today.
Go back and rest early.

33
00:03:25,367 --> 00:03:27,048
Young Lady, Xue Zhi isn't here,

34
00:03:27,087 --> 00:03:28,888
let me fetch some water
for you to wash up.

35
00:05:22,607 --> 00:05:24,448
Young Lady, you are...

36
00:05:24,808 --> 00:05:27,248
Someone came to my room just now.

37
00:05:27,688 --> 00:05:28,568
Someone?

38
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,967
- Let me go and check outside.
- Hold on.

39
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:49,632
The Old Master's painting of cypress
is famous worldwide.

40
00:05:49,648 --> 00:05:51,920
I guess the artistic conception
must be extraordinary.

41
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:54,128
It's a shame I haven't had
the chance to see it.

42
00:05:54,888 --> 00:05:56,967
If I could copy it daily,

43
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,640
I'd surely improve my skills.

44
00:05:59,744 --> 00:06:01,664
Could it be him?

45
00:06:02,008 --> 00:06:03,487
This was found on Ying, and there's

46
00:06:03,512 --> 00:06:04,512
still some powder in it.

47
00:06:04,578 --> 00:06:05,658
Throw it into Haitang Abode.

48
00:06:06,008 --> 00:06:08,407
Find a spot that's not too obvious
but also not too hidden,

49
00:06:08,527 --> 00:06:10,248
making sure Seventh Lady can find it.

50
00:06:10,568 --> 00:06:11,248
Got it.

51
00:06:37,527 --> 00:06:38,888
Father, I want to study.

52
00:06:39,768 --> 00:06:40,928
Hold out your hand.

53
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:45,448
Why are you hitting me?

54
00:06:45,647 --> 00:06:46,328
First,

55
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,167
you didn't greet me when you saw me.

56
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:48,794
Second,

57
00:06:49,487 --> 00:06:51,487
I've already told you,
without my permission,

58
00:06:51,513 --> 00:06:52,633
you are not allowed to see me.

59
00:06:52,768 --> 00:06:54,167
You said you wanted to study?

60
00:06:54,768 --> 00:06:56,607
Xuan is already studying at the academy.

61
00:06:56,632 --> 00:06:57,793
I want to study too.

62
00:06:58,928 --> 00:07:00,128
You can't study

63
00:07:00,248 --> 00:07:02,287
because you're not qualified.

64
00:07:06,195 --> 00:07:08,304
(Chen Jiuheng)

66
00:07:09,881 --> 00:07:11,482
Confucius said.

67
00:07:11,967 --> 00:07:13,847
To learn and practice what is learned.

68
00:07:13,928 --> 00:07:16,688
To learn and practice what is learned,

69
00:07:16,808 --> 00:07:18,527
Isn't that a joy?

70
00:07:18,607 --> 00:07:21,128
Isn't that a joy?

71
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:23,368
To have friends come from afar.

72
00:07:23,487 --> 00:07:26,808
To have friends come from afar.

73
00:07:26,928 --> 00:07:28,568
Isn't that a pleasure?

74
00:07:28,688 --> 00:07:31,287
Isn't that a pleasure?

75
00:07:56,647 --> 00:07:59,128
To learn and practice what is learned.

76
00:07:59,328 --> 00:08:01,448
Isn't that a joy?

77
00:08:01,888 --> 00:08:05,087
To have friends come from afar.

78
00:08:05,368 --> 00:08:07,609
Isn't that a pleasure?

79
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,728
Where do you come from, my friend?

80
00:08:11,967 --> 00:08:14,208
You come every day
to eavesdrop on my lessons.

81
00:08:14,242 --> 00:08:15,641
You should be very familiar with me.

82
00:08:15,815 --> 00:08:17,055
Why are you still afraid of me?

83
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,880
The class has ended,

84
00:08:22,287 --> 00:08:23,928
and yet you're still studying here.

85
00:08:24,167 --> 00:08:26,087
You're truly a good child
who loves to study.

86
00:08:26,287 --> 00:08:28,248
My father doesn't allow me to study.

87
00:08:28,527 --> 00:08:29,847
He doesn't like me very much.

88
00:08:30,073 --> 00:08:32,617
I sneak over here every day
to listen to your lessons.

89
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,440
But, it's time for lunch now.

90
00:08:37,504 --> 00:08:39,070
Why aren't you going home to have lunch?

91
00:08:40,007 --> 00:08:41,568
No one in my family cares about me.

92
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,039
Come.

93
00:08:47,048 --> 00:08:47,607
Sit here.

94
00:08:49,288 --> 00:08:51,208
You must be hungry. This is for you.

95
00:09:03,648 --> 00:09:04,408
Kid,

96
00:09:04,688 --> 00:09:07,328
do you know there's a type of bird?

97
00:09:08,007 --> 00:09:09,727
It doesn't spread its wings
for three years,

98
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:12,007
but when it does,
it could soar to the sky.

99
00:09:12,128 --> 00:09:13,280
Though it doesn't chirp often,

100
00:09:13,448 --> 00:09:15,688
when it does,
it makes everyone astonished.

101
00:09:16,048 --> 00:09:18,288
Victory and defeat
are unpredictable for warriors.

102
00:09:18,448 --> 00:09:21,448
Bearing shame and enduring humiliation
is a man's duty.

103
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:22,408
Remember,

104
00:09:22,767 --> 00:09:24,487
as long as you don't belittle yourself

105
00:09:24,808 --> 00:09:27,288
and work hard in your studies,

106
00:09:27,607 --> 00:09:28,967
one day

107
00:09:29,016 --> 00:09:32,617
you'll soar high in the sky.

108
00:09:43,448 --> 00:09:46,208
(A teacher is like a second parent to me.)

109
00:09:46,408 --> 00:09:48,288
(Without his guidance back then,)

110
00:09:48,408 --> 00:09:50,288
(I wouldn't be who I am today.)

111
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,967
(He was wronged and died unjustly.)

112
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:56,881
(I must seek justice for him.)

113
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,069
(Luo's Residence)

114
00:10:04,328 --> 00:10:05,127
Lan.

115
00:10:10,487 --> 00:10:11,288
Lan,

116
00:10:11,808 --> 00:10:14,087
if you have any needs,

117
00:10:14,139 --> 00:10:15,338
feel free to come to me.

118
00:10:16,688 --> 00:10:17,808
Thank you, Hairu.

119
00:10:18,127 --> 00:10:20,528
We don't need anything.

120
00:10:31,367 --> 00:10:32,847
To answer all the madams,

121
00:10:32,928 --> 00:10:34,528
the Old Madam is much better now.

122
00:10:34,553 --> 00:10:36,394
But, she's just a little tired today.

123
00:10:36,442 --> 00:10:38,322
So, there's no need for greetings.

124
00:10:38,443 --> 00:10:40,988
Please, all of you may return.

125
00:10:42,087 --> 00:10:44,448
Please take care of Mother.

126
00:10:55,007 --> 00:10:55,967
Ms. Xu,

127
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,399
has Grandma fallen ill again?

128
00:10:58,865 --> 00:11:00,304
Should we call Physician Li here?

129
00:11:00,688 --> 00:11:02,953
Madam Lin, Seventh Lady, don't worry.

130
00:11:03,127 --> 00:11:06,688
Old Madam had some sweets
last night and slept late.

131
00:11:06,808 --> 00:11:09,048
She's just a little sleepy today.

132
00:11:12,408 --> 00:11:14,448
How many times have I told you all?

133
00:11:14,648 --> 00:11:16,208
Don't meddle in others' affairs.

134
00:11:16,233 --> 00:11:17,873
Just take care of yourself.

135
00:11:18,448 --> 00:11:20,208
It was Sixth Sister who started it.

136
00:11:20,487 --> 00:11:22,607
I was just asking casually.

137
00:11:24,448 --> 00:11:25,688
But, Mother,

138
00:11:25,824 --> 00:11:27,220
why isn't the household management

139
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,000
handed over to our side?

140
00:11:29,328 --> 00:11:31,950
Even though Father's official rank
isn't as high as Second Uncle's,

141
00:11:32,328 --> 00:11:34,087
you come from a prestigious family,

142
00:11:34,247 --> 00:11:36,727
and Grandpa was even a scholar
at the Hanlin Academy.

143
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,559
Surely, you're more qualified
than Madam Lin.

144
00:11:39,594 --> 00:11:42,840
Exactly! And isn't
Mistress Qiao just a concubine?

145
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,544
Yet, she's been managing it for years.

146
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,632
Enough.

147
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:48,247
I don't want to bother
with these trivial matters.

148
00:11:48,768 --> 00:11:49,960
All I hope for is that you all

149
00:11:49,992 --> 00:11:51,592
live up to expectations.

150
00:11:52,087 --> 00:11:53,448
But, look at you now.

151
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:55,408
You always follow the cloud.

152
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:57,568
There's no difference
from the common women in the town.

153
00:11:58,808 --> 00:11:59,648
Go back

154
00:11:59,704 --> 00:12:01,585
and copy the
"Women's Precepts" ten times each.

155
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:11,648
Seventh Lady, this is...

156
00:12:11,688 --> 00:12:13,048
This is from Madam Lin.

157
00:12:13,056 --> 00:12:15,024
She noticed that you didn't have
enough coal,

158
00:12:15,056 --> 00:12:16,340
so she sent some more for you.

159
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:19,127
Third Brother caught a cold before,

160
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,080
so you need to take care and keep warm.

161
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:22,367
Thank you, Seventh Lady.

162
00:12:22,727 --> 00:12:24,087
It was probably Seventh Lady

163
00:12:24,112 --> 00:12:25,431
who reminded Madam Lin.

164
00:12:25,967 --> 00:12:27,007
You're welcome.

165
00:12:27,408 --> 00:12:28,448
I was actually

166
00:12:28,607 --> 00:12:30,528
going to bring some snacks,

167
00:12:30,607 --> 00:12:33,833
but a thief got into my room last night.

168
00:12:33,952 --> 00:12:35,660
And, there's an investigation
carry on now.

169
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,728
That's no small matter.
Does Butler Bai know about it?

170
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,840
I checked through it,
and nothing seems to be missing.

171
00:12:40,848 --> 00:12:43,040
So for now, there's no need
to alert the whole residence.

172
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,240
You should still be cautious about this.

173
00:12:49,408 --> 00:12:52,532
Don't worry. I've locked up
all the important things.

174
00:12:52,557 --> 00:12:53,238
That's great.

175
00:12:56,648 --> 00:12:58,767
The potted plants
in Third Brother's courtyard

176
00:12:58,792 --> 00:12:59,872
are growing so well.

177
00:13:00,168 --> 00:13:01,282
If Yining likes them,

178
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:03,239
I'll have Shao'an bring
a few pots over later.

179
00:13:03,448 --> 00:13:04,007
That's good.

180
00:13:04,328 --> 00:13:06,727
Then, I'd like Third Brother
to pick them for me.

181
00:13:08,568 --> 00:13:10,208
This pot is growing well.

182
00:13:12,007 --> 00:13:13,328
This looks nice too.

183
00:13:14,688 --> 00:13:15,847
I like that one.

184
00:13:22,967 --> 00:13:24,967
That one was pruned badly
by Shao'an before.

185
00:13:25,097 --> 00:13:27,727
I'm waiting for it to grow a bit more
before trimming it again.

186
00:13:27,887 --> 00:13:29,048
I don't think so.

187
00:13:29,328 --> 00:13:31,368
I feel like it has some artistic sense.

188
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:33,393
It looks quite messy,

189
00:13:33,418 --> 00:13:35,778
but there's a sense of upward momentum.

190
00:13:36,247 --> 00:13:37,887
Look at this side.

191
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:40,448
If I were to carve a couple of
the sword-wielding figures right there,

192
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:43,487
wouldn't it give off a sense
of striving for the better?

193
00:13:44,607 --> 00:13:46,808
Yining is always ambitious.

194
00:13:47,048 --> 00:13:48,767
Striving for the better?

195
00:13:49,487 --> 00:13:51,048
Seventh Lady, you got what I meant.

196
00:13:52,288 --> 00:13:53,007
Alright.

197
00:13:53,767 --> 00:13:56,283
I'll trim it a little more
and send it over to you later.

198
00:13:56,308 --> 00:13:57,667
Thank you, Third Brother.

199
00:13:57,865 --> 00:13:58,985
I'm leaving first.

200
00:14:11,087 --> 00:14:13,967
Young Master,
Seventh Lady is so kind to us.

201
00:14:17,688 --> 00:14:19,048
She's here to check the footprints.

202
00:14:19,127 --> 00:14:20,087
Footprints?

203
00:14:20,688 --> 00:14:21,887
What footprints?

204
00:14:22,367 --> 00:14:23,808
The ones I left last night.

205
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:25,528
I stepped in the incense ash.

206
00:14:26,288 --> 00:14:27,007
Young Master,

207
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,007
so you make mistakes too?

208
00:14:29,424 --> 00:14:31,184
So, did she discover anything just now?

209
00:14:31,568 --> 00:14:32,408
But, no worries.

210
00:14:32,528 --> 00:14:34,648
Young Master had me
return Ying's scented sachet.

211
00:14:34,656 --> 00:14:36,830
They might think the footprints
were left by the person

212
00:14:36,848 --> 00:14:38,110
who put the scented sachet.

213
00:14:39,247 --> 00:14:41,448
You're underestimating Seventh Lady.

214
00:14:42,087 --> 00:14:43,607
I've observed the footprints.

215
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:45,232
The shoe size does match,

216
00:14:45,248 --> 00:14:46,670
but there are at least five, if not ten,

217
00:14:46,673 --> 00:14:48,897
men in the residence
with the same shoe size.

218
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:51,568
I can't confirm that it was Jimo House.

219
00:14:53,408 --> 00:14:55,847
Perhaps I'm just overthinking.

220
00:14:56,007 --> 00:14:59,007
He's always shown interest in
Grandpa's paintings,

221
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,511
and last night, those were
exactly what had been moved...

222
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,128
Lady.

223
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,250
(Haitang Abode)

224
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,600
When the maids
were cleaning this morning,

225
00:15:08,632 --> 00:15:10,352
they found this under the table.

226
00:15:10,607 --> 00:15:12,887
This scented sachet isn't
from Haitang Abode.

227
00:15:13,408 --> 00:15:14,607
Judging by the stitching,

228
00:15:14,727 --> 00:15:16,408
it's not ours.

229
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:19,714
Lady, I've seen similar stitching
on a scented sachet

230
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:20,960
embroidered by Ying

231
00:15:21,161 --> 00:15:22,601
from Bilian Pavilion.

232
00:15:25,048 --> 00:15:25,648
Lady,

233
00:15:25,928 --> 00:15:27,607
this scent seems off.

234
00:15:27,792 --> 00:15:30,258
Could it be something
the thief left behind last night?

235
00:15:33,688 --> 00:15:35,208
Even if she suspects,

236
00:15:35,448 --> 00:15:37,448
a single footprint isn't
enough to prove anything.

237
00:15:38,408 --> 00:15:40,607
But since she hid the painting,

238
00:15:40,632 --> 00:15:43,408
it won't be easy to find it anymore.

239
00:15:43,433 --> 00:15:44,953
This Seventh Lady is really...

240
00:15:45,168 --> 00:15:46,607
We're not her enemies.

241
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:47,850
Why is she so guarded against us?

242
00:15:47,887 --> 00:15:50,727
It's not wrong to be cautious
in this residence.

243
00:15:53,847 --> 00:15:55,336
Maybe when she sees the scented sachet,

244
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,000
she'll realize it's a warning from us.

245
00:15:58,007 --> 00:15:59,808
Hopefully, Seventh Lady is smart enough.

246
00:15:59,808 --> 00:16:01,800
Otherwise, the effort
we've made to get close to her

247
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,152
will be ruined with nothing obtained,

248
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,216
and Mistress Qiao will send us back
to the said yard.

249
00:16:05,648 --> 00:16:06,967
It's not that simple.

250
00:16:07,887 --> 00:16:10,367
Mistress Qiao has met
her opponent this time.

251
00:16:10,568 --> 00:16:11,688
It's done. Take it away.

252
00:16:12,168 --> 00:16:12,727
Alright.

253
00:16:17,288 --> 00:16:18,408
By the way, Xue Zhi,

254
00:16:18,887 --> 00:16:21,060
where did you find this scented sachet?

255
00:16:21,408 --> 00:16:23,528
I found it under the table
near the incense burner.

256
00:16:24,767 --> 00:16:26,448
They've already poured
the medicinal powder.

257
00:16:26,576 --> 00:16:28,320
But, why would they
leave the scented sachet

258
00:16:28,353 --> 00:16:29,632
in such an obvious spot

259
00:16:30,007 --> 00:16:31,487
under the table?

260
00:16:31,531 --> 00:16:33,371
Perhaps they were panicked and careless.

261
00:16:33,529 --> 00:16:35,210
That's why they
dropped it somewhere else.

262
00:16:35,273 --> 00:16:37,194
Rather than it being dropped,

263
00:16:37,607 --> 00:16:39,087
it seems more like

264
00:16:39,367 --> 00:16:40,928
someone deliberately left it there.

265
00:16:41,928 --> 00:16:43,568
Lady, do you mean...

266
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,783
If I guess it correctly,

267
00:16:46,808 --> 00:16:48,448
I think someone is trying to help me.

268
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:49,408
Lady!

269
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,096
Lady, I figured out what this is.

270
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:55,240
It's a kind of medicinal powder

271
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,928
that will cause a rash
when you touch it.

272
00:16:57,007 --> 00:16:58,607
But, it's not life-threatening.

273
00:17:01,448 --> 00:17:02,928
The people from Bilian Pavilion

274
00:17:02,953 --> 00:17:04,513
are obviously trying to harm me.

275
00:17:04,888 --> 00:17:05,807
It seems

276
00:17:06,247 --> 00:17:08,487
I need to create a mess for them too.

277
00:17:09,088 --> 00:17:11,119
Has the restriction
on Yuechan been lifted?

278
00:17:11,144 --> 00:17:11,624
Yes.

279
00:17:11,848 --> 00:17:13,408
But, Mistress Qiao has been unwell

280
00:17:13,433 --> 00:17:14,473
and hasn't left her room.

281
00:17:14,496 --> 00:17:16,160
Second Master,
would you like to visit her?

282
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,920
No need. Get a Physician to check on her.

283
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:20,848
Alright.

284
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:25,807
Father.

285
00:17:27,688 --> 00:17:29,368
Why aren't you in your own courtyard?

286
00:17:29,487 --> 00:17:30,888
What are you doing out here?

287
00:17:31,767 --> 00:17:34,368
I just delivered some
potted plants to Madam Lin.

288
00:17:34,608 --> 00:17:35,608
I'm heading back now.

289
00:17:36,576 --> 00:17:38,760
You seem quite adept at
taking advantage of the condition,

290
00:17:39,247 --> 00:17:41,047
What a mind full of scheming.

291
00:17:42,096 --> 00:17:43,980
Your devious nature
reminds me of something...

292
00:17:44,009 --> 00:17:44,688
Father!

293
00:17:46,727 --> 00:17:48,168
Why are you so agitated?

294
00:17:48,928 --> 00:17:51,047
Father, please go visit Mistress Qiao.

295
00:17:51,114 --> 00:17:52,034
She is...

296
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,928
I've already asked Butler Bai
to fetch a Physician.

297
00:17:57,047 --> 00:17:58,088
As for you,

298
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,408
stay out of the inner household matters

299
00:18:00,527 --> 00:18:01,648
and focus on your studies.

300
00:18:02,287 --> 00:18:04,128
You know my expectations for you.

301
00:18:05,007 --> 00:18:06,007
I understand.

302
00:18:06,608 --> 00:18:07,688
But, Father,

303
00:18:07,807 --> 00:18:09,168
although Mistress Qiao's restriction

304
00:18:09,184 --> 00:18:11,010
was lifted, her guilt
has worsened her condition.

305
00:18:11,287 --> 00:18:12,807
It's a psychological issue.

306
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:14,168
You should go visit her.

307
00:18:22,807 --> 00:18:23,919
What happened?

308
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,040
- Don't touch it.
- What are

309
00:18:25,168 --> 00:18:26,287
these messy things?

310
00:18:26,304 --> 00:18:27,840
- Don't touch them.
- Throw them away!

311
00:18:29,287 --> 00:18:30,448
Don't touch it, Hairu.

312
00:18:31,967 --> 00:18:33,368
I'll teach you a lesson!

313
00:18:37,176 --> 00:18:37,616
You...

314
00:18:38,487 --> 00:18:40,688
I'll teach you a lesson!

315
00:18:41,368 --> 00:18:42,608
Mother.

316
00:18:45,701 --> 00:18:46,941
This is...

317
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:50,054
This... This is my youngest brother.

318
00:18:50,168 --> 00:18:51,208
(Lin Mao)
My Sixth Brother.

319
00:18:53,608 --> 00:18:54,527
Sixth Brother.

320
00:18:55,648 --> 00:18:57,088
You should call me Sixth Uncle.

321
00:18:57,648 --> 00:18:58,767
This is Seventh Lady, Yining,

322
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,840
whom I often mentioned in my letters.

323
00:19:01,848 --> 00:19:03,088
Greet her.

324
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:04,527
Seventh...

325
00:19:05,007 --> 00:19:06,247
Yining.

326
00:19:07,928 --> 00:19:08,967
Hello, Sixth Uncle.

327
00:19:10,967 --> 00:19:13,327
Don't be afraid.
This means Fu Gui likes you.

328
00:19:13,608 --> 00:19:14,408
Fu Gui.

329
00:19:14,967 --> 00:19:16,848
What a peculiar name.

330
00:19:16,873 --> 00:19:17,473
Of course.

331
00:19:17,967 --> 00:19:20,047
The name of my goose comes from a poem.

332
00:19:20,072 --> 00:19:21,829
"The wealth of life is
like a dew on the grass,

333
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:23,950
and the prestige earned is
like a flower by the roadside."

334
00:19:23,951 --> 00:19:26,247
It means that wealth in this world

335
00:19:26,487 --> 00:19:29,767
is trivial and not worth longing for.

336
00:19:30,007 --> 00:19:30,648
You...

337
00:19:33,727 --> 00:19:34,848
Sixth Uncle,

338
00:19:34,912 --> 00:19:36,080
you are indeed well-educated.

339
00:19:36,247 --> 00:19:37,648
What well-educated?

340
00:19:37,767 --> 00:19:39,448
He spends all his time on nonsense!

341
00:19:39,848 --> 00:19:41,888
My parents had him late in life,

342
00:19:42,007 --> 00:19:44,088
and the whole family
had high hopes for him.

343
00:19:44,168 --> 00:19:46,567
But from the age of ten,

344
00:19:46,688 --> 00:19:49,567
he became obsessed
with all sorts of odd things.

345
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,487
We've been worried so much about him.

346
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:52,807
We thought

347
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:54,432
the Luo's Residence
was a scholarly family,

348
00:19:54,448 --> 00:19:55,960
so they sent him here to me

349
00:19:56,171 --> 00:19:58,411
to be influenced
by the scholarly atmosphere.

350
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,480
Niece,

351
00:20:02,168 --> 00:20:03,648
I've heard so much about you.

352
00:20:03,904 --> 00:20:05,360
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.

353
00:20:05,549 --> 00:20:06,750
Sixth Uncle, you're too serious.

354
00:20:07,088 --> 00:20:07,688
By the way,

355
00:20:10,088 --> 00:20:11,168
I have a gift for you.

356
00:20:11,184 --> 00:20:12,580
An osmanthus hair oil
I made myself.

357
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,720
You still have it with you? Let me see.

358
00:20:14,767 --> 00:20:16,327
Mother, stop hitting him.

359
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:18,047
Where have you hidden it all?
Let me see.

360
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,679
It's broken now, sister.

361
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,520
- You still dare to pick it up.
- My face cream!

362
00:20:22,527 --> 00:20:23,527
My rouge!

363
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:24,759
I've just done mixing them.

364
00:20:24,928 --> 00:20:26,368
Stop hitting him, Mother!

365
00:20:26,848 --> 00:20:28,807
I need to talk to you
about something important.

366
00:20:29,448 --> 00:20:31,327
I'll deal with you later. And you too!

367
00:20:32,487 --> 00:20:34,727
- Let's go, Mother.
- I'll deal with you later.

368
00:20:34,807 --> 00:20:35,327
Fu Gui.

369
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:42,608
He's driving me mad.

370
00:20:42,633 --> 00:20:44,313
Mother, calm down.

371
00:20:44,487 --> 00:20:47,168
I came to talk about Mistress Qiao.

372
00:20:47,527 --> 00:20:48,807
What's wrong with her again?

373
00:20:48,864 --> 00:20:51,480
Her restriction has just been lifted,
and she's causing trouble again?

374
00:20:51,727 --> 00:20:52,567
No,

375
00:20:52,807 --> 00:20:54,967
it's about the accounts
you gave me last time.

376
00:20:56,287 --> 00:20:57,967
I went through them all.

377
00:20:57,992 --> 00:21:00,512
The records for brocade, ginseng, tea,

378
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:01,449
and bird's nest

379
00:21:01,608 --> 00:21:03,208
are all unclear.

380
00:21:03,327 --> 00:21:06,007
I checked the storeroom,
and they don't match up either.

381
00:21:06,047 --> 00:21:08,088
Also, our family's rented shops

382
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,600
are priced much lower

383
00:21:09,696 --> 00:21:10,936
than others.

384
00:21:11,848 --> 00:21:13,807
See? You understand it so quickly.

385
00:21:13,832 --> 00:21:14,711
You're still smart.

386
00:21:14,967 --> 00:21:15,688
Rui Xiang.

387
00:21:16,327 --> 00:21:17,567
Go call Mistress Qiao.

388
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:18,880
I'll settle the accounts with her.

389
00:21:19,047 --> 00:21:19,807
Alright.

390
00:21:22,967 --> 00:21:25,208
Mother, I have one more request.

391
00:21:25,287 --> 00:21:27,007
A request? Go ahead.

392
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:29,287
I want an Old Maid.

393
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:33,247
Didn't the Old Madam

394
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:34,832
just send four maids to your courtyard?

395
00:21:35,047 --> 00:21:38,247
What happens?
Are they not to your satisfaction?

396
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,040
No, that's not it.

397
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:40,408
I want

398
00:21:40,807 --> 00:21:43,168
Mistress Qiao's maid, Ms. Li.

399
00:21:46,007 --> 00:21:47,928
Let me think of a way
to arrange that for you.

400
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,083
(Caifu Abode)

401
00:21:51,567 --> 00:21:54,608
Do you know why Madam Lin
is summoning us?

402
00:21:54,633 --> 00:21:55,992
She only said to bring you,

403
00:21:56,057 --> 00:21:57,256
but didn't explain the reason.

404
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,543
This Madam Lin...

405
00:22:00,648 --> 00:22:03,848
Ever since she managed the household,
she's been causing me trouble.

406
00:22:04,368 --> 00:22:05,608
If anything happens later,

407
00:22:05,633 --> 00:22:06,833
go directly to Second Master.

408
00:22:10,247 --> 00:22:11,767
Greetings, Madam.

409
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:15,800
Mistress Qiao.

410
00:22:16,727 --> 00:22:17,648
I still have a headache.

411
00:22:17,689 --> 00:22:18,889
Mistress Qiao, are you alright?

412
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:21,047
My head is extremely dizzy.

413
00:22:21,104 --> 00:22:21,807
Be careful.

414
00:22:22,288 --> 00:22:23,920
Do you feel
more comfortable sitting down?

415
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,000
Much better.

416
00:22:25,073 --> 00:22:26,632
Thank you for your concern, Madam.

417
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:29,807
I called you here today

418
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:31,208
for two reasons.

419
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:32,448
First,

420
00:22:32,464 --> 00:22:34,280
you know that each courtyard
in this residence

421
00:22:34,312 --> 00:22:36,512
has a fixed number of
maids and nannies,

422
00:22:36,648 --> 00:22:37,928
right?

423
00:22:37,976 --> 00:22:38,736
Yes, I know.

424
00:22:39,327 --> 00:22:40,807
As a concubine,

425
00:22:41,007 --> 00:22:42,608
you have eight maids

426
00:22:42,633 --> 00:22:43,713
and six nannies,

427
00:22:43,856 --> 00:22:45,040
which is more than the servants

428
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:46,431
I have as a principal wife.

429
00:22:46,608 --> 00:22:48,608
Even if Second Master favors you,

430
00:22:48,888 --> 00:22:50,408
this is just a bit too over, is it?

431
00:22:51,247 --> 00:22:52,727
Madam, you're right.

432
00:22:52,848 --> 00:22:54,608
But, I have children.

433
00:22:54,727 --> 00:22:56,408
I have two children with me.

434
00:22:56,527 --> 00:22:58,888
So I need more servants.

435
00:23:00,287 --> 00:23:01,368
That's understandable.

436
00:23:01,648 --> 00:23:04,053
But it's only two children,

437
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:04,800
right?

438
00:23:06,408 --> 00:23:08,727
I think the servants

439
00:23:08,752 --> 00:23:10,073
for Yilian and Xuan's rooms

440
00:23:10,154 --> 00:23:11,097
should be removed.

441
00:23:11,247 --> 00:23:12,527
How could that be?

442
00:23:12,648 --> 00:23:13,897
How can they be removed?

443
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,640
I'm just following
the rules of the ancestors.

444
00:23:18,888 --> 00:23:20,368
Do you find that unreasonable?

445
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:23,168
Madam, you're right.

446
00:23:23,928 --> 00:23:26,287
I'll obey your arrangement.

447
00:23:28,928 --> 00:23:29,807
Rui Xiang,

448
00:23:30,094 --> 00:23:32,054
go to Bilian Pavilion
and reorganize everything.

449
00:23:32,688 --> 00:23:33,487
Alright.

450
00:23:37,047 --> 00:23:38,247
For the second matter,

451
00:23:39,368 --> 00:23:42,047
since I'm now managing Luo's Residence,

452
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,161
let's go through
the previous accounts together.

453
00:23:52,007 --> 00:23:53,088
What are you doing?

454
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,984
How dare you take the people of Bilian
Pavilion while Mistress Qiao is away!

455
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,881
Be careful
that Mistress Qiao punishes you

456
00:23:58,368 --> 00:23:59,727
when she comes back later.

457
00:24:00,128 --> 00:24:02,567
Mistress Qiao is currently having
an affair at Caifu Abode.

458
00:24:02,592 --> 00:24:04,032
She won't be back so soon.

459
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,480
Ms. Ying, would you like
to come with me to Caifu Abode

460
00:24:06,520 --> 00:24:08,000
- to ask for clarification?
- You...

461
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,160
Rui Xiang.

462
00:24:14,047 --> 00:24:15,408
What are you doing here?

463
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,561
Reply to Second Master

464
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,256
Mistress Qiao's courtyard
has more servants

465
00:24:18,288 --> 00:24:20,280
than even the Old Madam's.

466
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,080
Madam Lin felt it was against the rules

467
00:24:22,176 --> 00:24:23,856
and sent me to reorganize everything.

468
00:24:28,688 --> 00:24:29,527
Father.

469
00:24:29,928 --> 00:24:32,247
What's going on?

470
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:34,448
Lady, they're taking away our people.

471
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:35,480
Taking them away?

472
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,480
Father,

473
00:24:36,753 --> 00:24:37,952
are they taking them all?

474
00:24:38,128 --> 00:24:41,047
Then, I won't even have someone
to do my hair.

475
00:24:41,928 --> 00:24:43,487
And, what about Xuan's room?

476
00:24:43,567 --> 00:24:45,928
Why do they take
the servants of Xuan's room too?

477
00:24:46,128 --> 00:24:49,567
What Hairu said does make sense.

478
00:24:50,007 --> 00:24:51,287
There are simply too many people

479
00:24:51,408 --> 00:24:53,047
in the courtyard.

480
00:24:54,608 --> 00:24:56,688
Father, please let Ms. Li stay.

481
00:24:58,967 --> 00:25:01,527
She's taken care of Lian
since I was little.

482
00:25:01,608 --> 00:25:03,448
I can't bear to part with her.

483
00:25:03,487 --> 00:25:05,128
- Lady.
- Father.

484
00:25:05,641 --> 00:25:06,482
Father.

485
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,861
Lady! Lady!

486
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:11,640
- Lady.
- Lian.

487
00:25:11,713 --> 00:25:13,153
Go call a Physician, hurry up!

488
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,239
- Alright.
- Lian.

489
00:25:16,464 --> 00:25:18,760
For the twenty rolls of brocade
purchased by the residence.

490
00:25:18,792 --> 00:25:20,231
Where were they all distributed?

491
00:25:20,448 --> 00:25:22,247
I don't have any recollection
of this at all.

492
00:25:23,567 --> 00:25:24,608
Madam,

493
00:25:24,727 --> 00:25:26,487
those are from the past.

494
00:25:26,512 --> 00:25:28,992
I truly can't remember.

495
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:31,368
Can't remember?

496
00:25:31,848 --> 00:25:34,608
How have you been keeping
the accounts over the years?

497
00:25:34,848 --> 00:25:37,128
Everything that comes in and goes out

498
00:25:37,527 --> 00:25:39,688
should be clearly recorded.

499
00:25:40,727 --> 00:25:43,767
And for the tea leaves and supplements,
there's only

500
00:25:43,808 --> 00:25:45,120
a record of them coming in,

501
00:25:45,128 --> 00:25:46,807
but the expenditures are stated vaguely.

502
00:25:47,047 --> 00:25:48,327
This month, we just did

503
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,888
a full inventory of the treasury

504
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,841
and many items are missing.

505
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:54,168
Please go through
all the points I've marked

506
00:25:54,193 --> 00:25:55,354
and organize them for me,

507
00:25:55,807 --> 00:25:57,408
stating where they were distributed

508
00:25:57,456 --> 00:25:58,840
and recording them in the ledger.

509
00:25:59,208 --> 00:26:00,247
Alright.

510
00:26:02,448 --> 00:26:03,368
And,

511
00:26:04,088 --> 00:26:05,608
I never imagined

512
00:26:05,656 --> 00:26:07,535
that Mistress Qiao would be so generous,

513
00:26:07,928 --> 00:26:09,848
renting out our fields and shops

514
00:26:10,247 --> 00:26:13,327
at far below market rates.

515
00:26:13,648 --> 00:26:15,888
People who don't know
any better would think

516
00:26:15,928 --> 00:26:17,967
you've given them away
to your maternal family.

517
00:26:18,208 --> 00:26:19,830
Madam, back then,

518
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,496
it was my first time managing the
household, and I lacked experience.

519
00:26:22,688 --> 00:26:24,368
The lease term was long,

520
00:26:24,393 --> 00:26:26,472
so the prices were set a little lower.

521
00:26:27,767 --> 00:26:30,007
But, you can't run a business at a loss.

522
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,480
In addition, the harvests
from the fields

523
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:34,912
have been declining year after year,

524
00:26:35,128 --> 00:26:36,807
so I've replaced all the shopkeepers.

525
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:38,576
If the people beneath you
are incompetent,

526
00:26:38,608 --> 00:26:40,410
you should swiftly replace them.

527
00:26:40,888 --> 00:26:43,368
After all, the entire Luo family

528
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:45,648
- is relying on that.
- Alright.

529
00:26:48,527 --> 00:26:49,848
My dear, you're here.

530
00:26:53,408 --> 00:26:54,327
My dear, my dear.

531
00:26:54,648 --> 00:26:55,967
Come in.

532
00:26:59,128 --> 00:27:00,967
Are you here to see Mistress Qiao?

533
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:02,752
I'm here to see Hairu.

534
00:27:04,088 --> 00:27:05,487
My dear, have a seat.

535
00:27:06,593 --> 00:27:08,232
Have your seat.

536
00:27:09,368 --> 00:27:10,247
Have your seat.

537
00:27:10,368 --> 00:27:11,287
Have your seat.

538
00:27:16,527 --> 00:27:18,567
My dear, you must have just
come from Bilian Pavilion.

539
00:27:20,767 --> 00:27:21,727
Hairu.

540
00:27:22,818 --> 00:27:24,697
Mistress Qiao has indeed
been a bit careless

541
00:27:25,128 --> 00:27:26,688
in managing the household.

542
00:27:27,128 --> 00:27:28,608
But Yilian, my girl,

543
00:27:28,848 --> 00:27:30,368
has been a pampered child since young.

544
00:27:30,648 --> 00:27:32,888
If you suddenly take away
all the people around her,

545
00:27:33,648 --> 00:27:36,487
she won't be able to bear it.

546
00:27:38,247 --> 00:27:40,448
I understand
you're concerned for Fifth Lady.

547
00:27:41,408 --> 00:27:43,247
But don't you think I am too?

548
00:27:44,088 --> 00:27:46,368
Surely you know better

549
00:27:46,390 --> 00:27:48,480
the importance of managing
a household and a country.

550
00:27:49,047 --> 00:27:51,247
Without rules and regulations,

551
00:27:51,272 --> 00:27:52,593
there can be no peace at home.

552
00:27:53,368 --> 00:27:55,967
Fifth Lady is of age for marriage now,

553
00:27:56,047 --> 00:27:57,448
and when she marries,

554
00:27:57,567 --> 00:27:59,888
she'll be a Madam of her household.

555
00:28:00,057 --> 00:28:01,817
She should start learning now

556
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:04,888
how to be a good role model
and follow the rules,

557
00:28:05,088 --> 00:28:06,007
right?

558
00:28:14,888 --> 00:28:17,168
You're absolutely right.

559
00:28:18,368 --> 00:28:19,487
So,

560
00:28:20,208 --> 00:28:22,888
other than the
personal maid and Ms. Li,

561
00:28:24,848 --> 00:28:26,448
let's do as you've suggested.

562
00:28:45,608 --> 00:28:47,487
Has the medicine
started to take effect yet?

563
00:28:50,088 --> 00:28:52,047
Did you put it in?

564
00:28:52,848 --> 00:28:53,928
Yes, I did,

565
00:28:54,128 --> 00:28:56,287
especially in Seventh Lady's
scented powder box.

566
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,912
But I don't understand
why the medicine hasn't worked yet.

567
00:28:58,920 --> 00:28:59,840
Could it be a problem...

568
00:29:00,567 --> 00:29:03,208
- with the medicinal powder itself?
- Impossible.

569
00:29:03,688 --> 00:29:06,608
I paid a fortune
to get this from my uncle.

570
00:29:06,807 --> 00:29:09,128
Lady, or we just have
to wait a little longer.

571
00:29:10,128 --> 00:29:12,247
It's useless to have you with me.

572
00:29:15,327 --> 00:29:16,967
Why are you still kneeling here?

573
00:29:17,047 --> 00:29:19,287
Go keep an eye on there
and report back to me.

574
00:29:19,329 --> 00:29:20,129
Alright.

575
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,560
Lady, have some tea.

576
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,400
Ever since you started learning
bookkeeping from Madam Lin,

577
00:29:38,433 --> 00:29:40,233
you've been glued
to the ledger every day.

578
00:29:41,727 --> 00:29:43,727
Madam Lin is straightforward,

579
00:29:43,856 --> 00:29:45,096
but when it comes to bookkeeping,

580
00:29:45,138 --> 00:29:46,977
she's meticulous and thoughtful.

581
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:49,767
I'm learning a lot from her.

582
00:29:49,808 --> 00:29:51,400
Once you acquire
the bookkeeping skills,

583
00:29:51,430 --> 00:29:53,040
and soon when you marry
as a principal wife,

584
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,768
you'll have no trouble
running a household.

585
00:29:55,047 --> 00:29:56,688
How can an unmarried girl speak that?

586
00:29:56,744 --> 00:29:57,825
Aren't you ashamed?

587
00:30:00,688 --> 00:30:02,928
And besides, who said
I'm learning these things

588
00:30:02,953 --> 00:30:04,753
to prepare for marriage?

589
00:30:05,368 --> 00:30:07,848
I'm learning them for myself.

590
00:30:08,247 --> 00:30:09,648
Lady, if you're not learning that

591
00:30:09,673 --> 00:30:11,314
to manage a household in the future,

592
00:30:11,527 --> 00:30:13,608
then are you planning to do a business?

593
00:30:13,888 --> 00:30:15,736
But among the four occupations...

594
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:18,287
Judging people based on their occupation
is shallow and ignorant.

595
00:30:18,888 --> 00:30:20,928
If one can support oneself
through one's own efforts,

596
00:30:21,168 --> 00:30:22,727
what's there to be ashamed of?

597
00:30:24,327 --> 00:30:25,047
Lady.

598
00:30:27,767 --> 00:30:29,727
Lady, Rui Xiang brought news

599
00:30:29,752 --> 00:30:30,992
that Ms. Li wasn't taken away.

600
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,496
Fifth Lady cried herself unconscious

601
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,064
and begged Second Master
to let her stay.

602
00:30:35,688 --> 00:30:36,888
I think that Ms. Li

603
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,608
must have helped Mistress Qiao

604
00:30:38,633 --> 00:30:40,314
do plenty of unspeakable things.

605
00:30:41,168 --> 00:30:42,368
It seems Mistress Qiao

606
00:30:42,567 --> 00:30:44,487
won't easily hand her over to me.

607
00:30:44,648 --> 00:30:47,312
Lady, did you request Ms. Li
from Mistress Qiao

608
00:30:47,376 --> 00:30:49,080
because you wanted
to investigate something?

609
00:30:49,327 --> 00:30:51,448
When Mistress Qiao
had a miscarriage years ago,

610
00:30:51,928 --> 00:30:53,727
Physician Gu who took care
of her happened

611
00:30:53,752 --> 00:30:54,832
to return to his hometown.

612
00:30:55,047 --> 00:30:57,247
So, they temporarily
hired Physician Chen.

613
00:30:57,567 --> 00:30:59,088
The person who fetched Physician Chen

614
00:30:59,144 --> 00:31:00,503
was Ms. Li.

615
00:31:00,727 --> 00:31:02,047
Lady, are you suspecting

616
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:03,759
that Ms. Li knows the truth

617
00:31:03,784 --> 00:31:05,183
behind Mistress Qiao's miscarriage?

618
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:06,290
Not only that.

619
00:31:07,247 --> 00:31:09,487
When Mistress Qiao married
into the Luo family,

620
00:31:09,512 --> 00:31:11,032
she brought this Ms. Li with her.

621
00:31:11,567 --> 00:31:13,408
She must know a lot

622
00:31:13,527 --> 00:31:15,128
about how my mother was framed.

623
00:31:15,567 --> 00:31:16,208
Lady,

624
00:31:16,327 --> 00:31:17,888
what should we do next?

625
00:31:18,608 --> 00:31:21,208
Since Bilian Pavilion
tried to poison me,

626
00:31:22,848 --> 00:31:25,327
it's time we return the favor.

627
00:31:31,688 --> 00:31:33,327
Madam, please have some tea.

628
00:31:42,128 --> 00:31:43,408
Greetings to Mother.

629
00:31:43,767 --> 00:31:44,807
Yining, you're here.

630
00:31:45,088 --> 00:31:45,967
Come have a seat.

631
00:31:56,128 --> 00:31:57,128
It's scalding hot.

632
00:31:58,368 --> 00:31:59,287
You're here.

633
00:32:01,848 --> 00:32:03,567
Greetings, Madam.

634
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:17,608
You're here. Please have a seat.

635
00:32:17,928 --> 00:32:19,368
Sit down.

636
00:32:21,247 --> 00:32:22,128
Mother,

637
00:32:22,767 --> 00:32:24,967
you don't look well.

638
00:32:25,047 --> 00:32:26,688
Have you been busy

639
00:32:26,767 --> 00:32:28,567
preparing gifts for
the Emperor's birthday?

640
00:32:28,648 --> 00:32:29,848
You're right.

641
00:32:30,088 --> 00:32:31,487
You just reminded me.

642
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,321
Rui Xiang,

643
00:32:32,688 --> 00:32:34,327
go call Butler Bai here,

644
00:32:34,807 --> 00:32:37,368
let's review the tribute gifts again.

645
00:32:37,487 --> 00:32:38,287
Alright.

646
00:32:39,623 --> 00:32:41,727
Yining, what's wrong? Are you unwell?

647
00:32:43,007 --> 00:32:44,648
I feel very itchy out of a sudden.

648
00:32:46,888 --> 00:32:49,208
Why is it so itchy?

649
00:32:50,408 --> 00:32:51,888
And, it's getting more itchy.

650
00:32:54,247 --> 00:32:55,287
Yining,

651
00:32:55,608 --> 00:32:57,007
why is your neck

652
00:32:57,032 --> 00:32:59,072
covered in red rashes?

653
00:32:59,287 --> 00:32:59,967
Really?

654
00:33:00,648 --> 00:33:02,648
Is it red now? No wonder it's so itchy.

655
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,041
Qing Qu, go take a look.

656
00:33:06,408 --> 00:33:07,807
It really is...

657
00:33:15,047 --> 00:33:15,848
Mistress Qiao,

658
00:33:15,911 --> 00:33:17,537
why do you have the red rashes too?

659
00:33:17,967 --> 00:33:20,408
- Where is it?
- It's all over.

660
00:33:20,433 --> 00:33:22,514
What about my face?
Is it on my face too?

661
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,479
It's here as well.

662
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,440
Really?

663
00:33:26,007 --> 00:33:27,368
Go quickly and call Physician Li

664
00:33:27,393 --> 00:33:28,633
to check on Yining.

665
00:33:28,658 --> 00:33:29,979
Hurry up! And check on me too.

666
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:30,795
What about me?

667
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,279
Go get the Physician?

668
00:33:32,304 --> 00:33:34,143
Physician Li, check on me too!

669
00:33:34,186 --> 00:33:35,146
She's been poisoned.

670
00:33:38,608 --> 00:33:39,888
What kind of poison is that?

671
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,720
I've seen this poison
in the countryside before.

672
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:44,096
It causes red rashes all over the body
and unbearable itching.

673
00:33:44,128 --> 00:33:45,448
Internally, it causes swelling

674
00:33:45,470 --> 00:33:46,704
of the abdomen, chest, and throat.

675
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,120
In a short time,

676
00:33:48,247 --> 00:33:49,807
it can lead to suffocation and death.

677
00:33:51,007 --> 00:33:52,767
Is there any cure?

678
00:33:53,065 --> 00:33:54,785
I have a detoxification pill,

679
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:56,096
but I'm not sure if it will work.

680
00:33:56,304 --> 00:33:57,900
- Quick, give it to her!
- Give it to me!

681
00:33:57,904 --> 00:33:58,600
Here you go, Lady.

682
00:34:05,088 --> 00:34:06,287
Is there only one pill?

683
00:34:07,168 --> 00:34:08,528
I only have one.

684
00:34:08,593 --> 00:34:10,192
Then, what about Mistress Qiao?

685
00:34:10,217 --> 00:34:11,297
Find another one, quickly!

686
00:34:11,568 --> 00:34:12,447
Someone!

687
00:34:12,585 --> 00:34:14,184
Physician, someone!

688
00:34:14,209 --> 00:34:15,370
Where is the Physician?

689
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:16,520
Stop shouting.

690
00:34:17,447 --> 00:34:19,751
Isn't there a Physician
in the residence, Butler?

691
00:34:20,847 --> 00:34:21,367
This...

692
00:34:21,648 --> 00:34:22,447
Madam.

693
00:34:23,208 --> 00:34:24,767
What's happening

694
00:34:24,784 --> 00:34:26,080
with Seventh Lady and Mistress Qiao?

695
00:34:26,144 --> 00:34:27,160
Yining is unwell.

696
00:34:27,193 --> 00:34:28,673
Go find a physician immediately!

697
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:29,281
Fifth Lady,

698
00:34:30,767 --> 00:34:33,072
may I check the pulse of Mistress Qiao?

699
00:34:33,247 --> 00:34:35,208
Come on, why are you
still standing there?

700
00:34:35,287 --> 00:34:36,767
You should have said that earlier!

701
00:34:36,792 --> 00:34:38,473
Why are you just standing still there?

702
00:34:39,407 --> 00:34:40,807
Go call the Physician quickly!

703
00:34:40,832 --> 00:34:41,672
And the rest of you!

704
00:34:41,968 --> 00:34:43,847
Why are you all standing still there?

705
00:34:43,872 --> 00:34:44,791
Shouldn't you

706
00:34:45,081 --> 00:34:46,561
be figuring something out?

707
00:34:46,673 --> 00:34:48,488
Stop standing there

708
00:34:48,537 --> 00:34:50,017
and go get a Physician!

709
00:34:50,807 --> 00:34:51,568
You...

710
00:34:52,825 --> 00:34:53,546
Mistress Qiao.

711
00:34:55,128 --> 00:34:56,168
Is she dead?

712
00:34:57,048 --> 00:34:59,568
Mistress Qiao's pulse
is extremely weak. I'm worried if...

713
00:35:00,608 --> 00:35:02,088
How could she be dead?

714
00:35:02,168 --> 00:35:04,287
It was just a medicinal powder
that causes rashes.

715
00:35:06,168 --> 00:35:07,648
She won't die.

716
00:35:12,208 --> 00:35:14,727
How do you know the
medicinal powder only causes rashes?

717
00:35:15,407 --> 00:35:16,447
Was it you who did this?

718
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,120
Mistress Qiao.

719
00:35:28,488 --> 00:35:30,168
Did it ruin my face?

720
00:35:37,128 --> 00:35:39,048
Ying confessed everything.

721
00:35:39,128 --> 00:35:39,847
Yilian,

722
00:35:40,287 --> 00:35:41,927
what else do you have
to say for yourself?

723
00:35:42,168 --> 00:35:42,927
Father.

724
00:35:42,954 --> 00:35:45,353
I didn't do it! I didn't!

725
00:35:45,378 --> 00:35:46,177
My dear!

726
00:35:47,688 --> 00:35:49,648
My dear! My dear!

727
00:35:52,048 --> 00:35:52,847
My dear!

728
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:55,909
You know Lian's character well.

729
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,840
She wouldn't even dare step on a bug,

730
00:35:58,941 --> 00:36:00,700
how could she poison someone?

731
00:36:00,875 --> 00:36:03,968
And not to mention, with something
as vicious as this itching powder?

732
00:36:03,993 --> 00:36:05,993
How did it get exaggerated by Qing Qu

733
00:36:06,018 --> 00:36:07,378
into poison?

734
00:36:07,488 --> 00:36:09,300
Qing Qu may have
some knowledge of medicine,

735
00:36:09,330 --> 00:36:10,768
but she's not a professional physician.

736
00:36:10,887 --> 00:36:13,247
Besides, the symptoms
you two had were dangerous.

737
00:36:13,328 --> 00:36:15,049
It's understandable
if she's misdiagnosed.

738
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,001
Also,

739
00:36:16,137 --> 00:36:18,705
the maids, nannies, and even Butler Bai

740
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:20,570
all heard what Yilian said.

741
00:36:24,887 --> 00:36:25,528
My dear,

742
00:36:25,968 --> 00:36:27,648
there's something strange about this.

743
00:36:27,847 --> 00:36:30,008
If Lian truly wanted
to harm Seventh Lady,

744
00:36:30,208 --> 00:36:31,847
then why did I get affected too?

745
00:36:36,608 --> 00:36:37,407
Husband,

746
00:36:38,168 --> 00:36:40,327
Fifth Lady has always been
so well-behaved.

747
00:36:40,352 --> 00:36:41,632
It's hard to believe

748
00:36:41,681 --> 00:36:43,562
she could do such a thing.

749
00:36:44,327 --> 00:36:45,048
I think

750
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:48,639
it's more likely that the Old Maid
and maids in her room influenced her.

751
00:36:49,247 --> 00:36:52,049
Some servants just take advantage
of their master's good manners,

752
00:36:52,407 --> 00:36:55,208
becoming arrogant and manipulative.

753
00:36:55,648 --> 00:36:57,327
Madam's explanation is reasonable.

754
00:36:57,727 --> 00:36:58,568
Someone!

755
00:36:59,847 --> 00:37:01,568
Drag out all the servants
from Yilian's room

756
00:37:02,208 --> 00:37:03,447
and hit them!

757
00:37:03,648 --> 00:37:04,287
Alright.

758
00:37:04,648 --> 00:37:05,447
Husband.

759
00:37:05,847 --> 00:37:07,968
I'll handle this matter.

760
00:37:07,993 --> 00:37:09,033
Please calm down.

761
00:37:09,367 --> 00:37:10,367
Hairu,

762
00:37:10,847 --> 00:37:12,128
please handle all this.

763
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,200
As for Yilian,

764
00:37:15,847 --> 00:37:17,168
give her 30 lashes.

765
00:37:17,728 --> 00:37:19,232
No one is allowed to plead for her.

766
00:37:23,447 --> 00:37:24,488
Hairu,

767
00:37:25,168 --> 00:37:27,048
let's not spread this shameful matter

768
00:37:27,327 --> 00:37:28,727
about the second home.

769
00:37:28,968 --> 00:37:31,968
Punish all the servants
involved in this.

770
00:37:32,016 --> 00:37:33,960
Make sure neither Old Madam
nor the principal home

771
00:37:34,128 --> 00:37:35,887
hears a word about it.

772
00:37:36,688 --> 00:37:37,648
Understood.

773
00:37:41,447 --> 00:37:42,847
Father.

774
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,720
- Father.
- My dear.

775
00:37:47,128 --> 00:37:48,728
- My dear.
- Father.

776
00:37:48,753 --> 00:37:49,834
- My dear.

777
00:37:58,407 --> 00:37:59,088
Lady,

778
00:37:59,327 --> 00:38:01,385
your tactic of returning the favor

779
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:02,688
was brilliant.

780
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:05,408
Even Second Master can't protect
the people at Bilian Pavilion anymore.

781
00:38:06,208 --> 00:38:08,688
For what happened today,
I should thank Mother.

782
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,799
They were the ones

783
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:12,960
who plotted against you first.

784
00:38:13,247 --> 00:38:15,327
Your Father got really angry

785
00:38:15,352 --> 00:38:16,672
at Bilian Pavilion just now.

786
00:38:17,408 --> 00:38:19,120
If it weren't for that
scented sachet of yours,

787
00:38:19,153 --> 00:38:20,833
Ying wouldn't have
confessed the truth.

788
00:38:21,327 --> 00:38:22,367
Otherwise,

789
00:38:22,447 --> 00:38:24,528
who knows how Mistress Qiao

790
00:38:24,553 --> 00:38:25,913
would have twisted things again.

791
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,121
By the way, where did you

792
00:38:28,161 --> 00:38:29,362
get that scented sachet?

793
00:38:30,128 --> 00:38:31,088
Someone

794
00:38:31,113 --> 00:38:32,712
deliberately threw it into my courtyard.

795
00:38:33,088 --> 00:38:34,128
Who could it be?

796
00:38:34,528 --> 00:38:35,568
Right now,

797
00:38:35,807 --> 00:38:37,208
I'm not sure yet.

798
00:38:37,808 --> 00:38:39,360
Let's not worry about that for now.

799
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:40,807
We finally

800
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:42,448
caught Bilian Pavilion making a mistake,

801
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:45,048
but your father
doesn't want to publicize it.

802
00:38:45,447 --> 00:38:47,008
It's infuriating!

803
00:38:47,447 --> 00:38:50,033
Father cares most
about maintaining prestige.

804
00:38:50,208 --> 00:38:52,208
He doesn't want Luo Yilian

805
00:38:52,233 --> 00:38:54,114
to carry the blame
for harming her own sister.

806
00:38:54,247 --> 00:38:57,153
But every action has
its cause and consequence.

807
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,840
We just need to cultivate
the cause little by little,

808
00:39:00,247 --> 00:39:02,727
so that Father can slowly

809
00:39:02,847 --> 00:39:05,168
see their true faces.

810
00:39:06,688 --> 00:39:07,367
Oh yeah,

811
00:39:07,488 --> 00:39:09,327
there's another unexpected
gain this time.

812
00:39:09,727 --> 00:39:12,208
I've already taken Ms. Li
out of Bilian Pavilion.

813
00:39:12,327 --> 00:39:13,727
But she's been beaten,

814
00:39:13,767 --> 00:39:15,688
so she needs time to recover.
Once she's healed,

815
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,081
I'll send her to your courtyard.

816
00:39:19,208 --> 00:39:20,367
Thank you, Mother.

817
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,832
(Bilian Pavilion)

818
00:39:27,008 --> 00:39:28,568
It's all swollen.

819
00:39:32,168 --> 00:39:34,287
Mother, it hurts.

820
00:39:36,608 --> 00:39:38,327
Why did you act on your own?

821
00:39:38,608 --> 00:39:41,247
If I hadn't been tricked
and panicked today,

822
00:39:41,488 --> 00:39:44,168
I almost fell into that
cunning girl's trap! Do you know that?

823
00:39:44,727 --> 00:39:46,247
Mother, I only wanted

824
00:39:46,272 --> 00:39:47,953
to make Luo Yining fall ill.

825
00:39:48,064 --> 00:39:50,360
That way, Madam Lin would have
one less person to support her.

826
00:39:50,568 --> 00:39:53,528
I couldn't stand how they
kept bullying you,

827
00:39:53,648 --> 00:39:55,568
and I just couldn't swallow my anger.

828
00:39:55,593 --> 00:39:57,593
How many times have I told you,

829
00:39:57,927 --> 00:40:01,008
even if you can't swallow your anger,
you must!

830
00:40:01,128 --> 00:40:02,794
You need to swallow your anger first,

831
00:40:02,821 --> 00:40:04,381
then only figure out what to do.

832
00:40:05,807 --> 00:40:07,847
Do you know how much trust and love

833
00:40:07,872 --> 00:40:09,775
you have consumed

834
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,280
between our bond with your father?

835
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,679
I know my mistake now.

836
00:40:17,727 --> 00:40:19,168
Get this maid out

837
00:40:19,232 --> 00:40:20,272
and give her 20 lashes.

838
00:40:20,407 --> 00:40:22,367
Mistress Qiao, please have mercy on me.

839
00:40:22,568 --> 00:40:23,807
No, Mother!

840
00:40:23,835 --> 00:40:24,835
Ying has already

841
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:27,000
been beaten by the Madam Lin.

842
00:40:27,059 --> 00:40:30,048
Bilian Pavilion can't tolerate servants
who betray their masters.

843
00:40:30,168 --> 00:40:33,168
Mistress Qiao, I would never betray you.

844
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,880
What happened today
was because Madam Lin

845
00:40:36,208 --> 00:40:38,008
tricked me with that scented sachet.

846
00:40:38,033 --> 00:40:39,953
I panicked and fell for her trap.

847
00:40:39,978 --> 00:40:42,247
I would never dare betray Lady.

848
00:40:42,327 --> 00:40:43,847
How did she get your scented sachet?

849
00:40:43,968 --> 00:40:46,208
I remember after I scattered

850
00:40:46,327 --> 00:40:48,247
the medicinal powder at Haitang Abode,

851
00:40:48,327 --> 00:40:50,488
I kept the scented sachet well.

852
00:40:50,648 --> 00:40:51,727
I don't know

853
00:40:51,752 --> 00:40:53,672
how it ended up with Madam Lin.

854
00:40:53,767 --> 00:40:56,488
Mother, please forgive
Ying this time.

855
00:40:56,688 --> 00:40:57,767
I only have

856
00:40:57,968 --> 00:41:00,793
such a considerate maid
left with me now.

857
00:41:01,927 --> 00:41:04,020
You've been by Fifth Lady's side

858
00:41:04,045 --> 00:41:05,244
since she was little.

859
00:41:05,449 --> 00:41:07,208
You saw her doing wrong, and you didn't

860
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,672
do your part
to remind her.

861
00:41:08,697 --> 00:41:10,337
To teach you a lesson.

862
00:41:11,367 --> 00:41:13,447
You can't avoid being lashed
about the hand.

863
00:41:14,488 --> 00:41:16,447
Be gentle with her.

864
00:41:19,927 --> 00:41:21,847
You come here and sit down.

865
00:41:22,048 --> 00:41:22,648
Come.

866
00:41:30,287 --> 00:41:31,767
Let me see your hands.

867
00:41:46,807 --> 00:41:47,648
Yilian,

868
00:41:48,168 --> 00:41:49,608
we have

869
00:41:50,088 --> 00:41:51,327
endured so much

870
00:41:51,968 --> 00:41:53,247
over the years.

871
00:41:54,447 --> 00:41:56,327
It has been tough for us.

872
00:41:56,568 --> 00:41:58,488
You've suffered so much,

873
00:41:58,513 --> 00:42:00,233
and now we can see your father

874
00:42:00,648 --> 00:42:02,727
starting to favor us gradually.

875
00:42:03,319 --> 00:42:05,000
I beg you

876
00:42:05,697 --> 00:42:07,618
to endure just a little longer

877
00:42:07,663 --> 00:42:09,102
for the sake of yourself

878
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:12,048
and for our family, okay?

879
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,960
I understand.

880
00:42:15,327 --> 00:42:17,927
What happened today should be a lesson.

881
00:42:18,128 --> 00:42:19,727
Keep in mind,

882
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:22,400
don't act recklessly again.

883
00:42:27,847 --> 00:42:29,767
By the way, Mother, Ms. Li

884
00:42:29,847 --> 00:42:31,927
has been taken away
by the Madam Lin's people.

885
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:34,320
- What should we do?
- Ms. Li...

886
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:38,327
Ms. Li has known too much about us.

887
00:42:38,767 --> 00:42:41,407
