4
00:01:45,173 --> 00:01:46,292
If so, can you tell me about

5
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:48,572
the relationship between you

6
00:01:49,372 --> 00:01:51,733
and Lu Jiaxue?

7
00:02:21,293 --> 00:02:22,133
Third Brother,

8
00:02:22,692 --> 00:02:24,573
Lu Jiaxue and I are now strangers.

9
00:02:24,613 --> 00:02:26,492
You mustn't be distracted because of me.

10
00:02:26,893 --> 00:02:29,613
Your priority right now is to study hard

11
00:02:29,665 --> 00:02:30,990
and pass the imperial examination.

12
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:09,887
♪Love, subtle and vivid♪

13
00:03:11,573 --> 00:03:13,972
Third Brother, what are you...

♪Afraid of missing out and mistakes,

15
00:03:24,613 --> 00:03:25,453
I just

16
00:03:28,246 --> 00:03:29,806
regret the fact that I couldn't

17
00:03:29,807 --> 00:03:31,206
reunite with you earlier.

18
00:03:33,664 --> 00:03:35,808
I regret the fact
that I couldn't protect you.

19
00:03:37,613 --> 00:03:39,492
But no matter what,

20
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:41,293
we're still reunited.

21
00:03:43,893 --> 00:03:44,972
Third Brother,

22
00:03:45,413 --> 00:03:47,133
I wish to head back first.

23
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:49,613
Okay.

Young Lady,

27
00:04:12,372 --> 00:04:14,573
I saw Third Young Master
hugging you just now.

28
00:04:16,093 --> 00:04:19,053
He's just too worried about me.

29
00:04:20,976 --> 00:04:22,560
Third Young Master is the nicest brother

30
00:04:22,581 --> 00:04:23,900
in the world.

31
00:04:23,973 --> 00:04:26,173
He even prepared your dowries for you.

32
00:04:27,492 --> 00:04:29,372
Yeah. He's my third brother.

33
00:04:29,653 --> 00:04:30,892
Of course he's nice to me.

(Happiness)

36
00:05:22,533 --> 00:05:24,413
I don't like studying or writing.

37
00:05:24,572 --> 00:05:26,692
There must be no
calligraphy paintings in the house.

38
00:05:27,008 --> 00:05:28,210
There must also be no desks.

39
00:05:28,413 --> 00:05:30,492
I want my favorite clay dolls

40
00:05:30,533 --> 00:05:31,733
and papercraft

41
00:05:32,213 --> 00:05:33,892
to be lined neatly in a row.

42
00:05:34,016 --> 00:05:35,090
They'll keep me company.

43
00:05:35,613 --> 00:05:36,213
All right.

44
00:05:36,892 --> 00:05:39,533
I brought you some
delicious dates today.

45
00:05:39,692 --> 00:05:40,692
Why don't you try one?

46
00:05:42,132 --> 00:05:43,533
You should try one.

47
00:05:48,213 --> 00:05:49,012
Mei.

48
00:05:49,733 --> 00:05:51,332
Besides eating,

49
00:05:52,213 --> 00:05:54,572
do you know what else
these dates can be used for?

50
00:05:55,492 --> 00:05:56,293
I don't.

51
00:05:57,293 --> 00:05:58,613
During one's wedding night,

52
00:05:58,976 --> 00:06:00,400
one will lay them on the bed

53
00:06:00,892 --> 00:06:02,892
so that the bride can give birth soon.

54
00:06:03,533 --> 00:06:05,372
Lu Jiaxue, I'm feeding you dates here,

55
00:06:05,372 --> 00:06:06,692
yet you want me to give birth soon?

56
00:06:22,733 --> 00:06:23,533
Sixth Uncle,

57
00:06:23,812 --> 00:06:25,932
is this the new product you invented?

58
00:06:26,213 --> 00:06:28,053
Yanrong Pavilion
is open for business now.

59
00:06:28,132 --> 00:06:30,372
Naturally, I have
to come up with new products.

60
00:06:30,653 --> 00:06:31,452
Take another sniff.

61
00:06:34,132 --> 00:06:35,812
No matter how many times I smell it,

62
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:37,552
it smells like a certain type of herb.

63
00:06:37,934 --> 00:06:39,653
This is called Deity Goddess Powder.

64
00:06:39,692 --> 00:06:41,132
It's made of motherwort.

65
00:06:41,132 --> 00:06:42,833
I made some adjustments
to the formula found

66
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,119
in Tang bencao.

67
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,309
I added some ingredients to it.

68
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,853
Cleansing your face with it
twice per day

69
00:06:46,853 --> 00:06:48,213
can remove spots and whiten the skin,

70
00:06:48,213 --> 00:06:50,213
making it smooth and flawless.

71
00:06:50,533 --> 00:06:53,053
All right. I'll give it a try, then.

72
00:06:53,168 --> 00:06:55,610
There are only two bottles here.
I'll give you one more bottle.

73
00:06:55,613 --> 00:06:56,812
You can give it to Yixiu.

74
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:01,492
We can't just let Aunt detain Yixiu

75
00:07:02,332 --> 00:07:03,492
all the time.

76
00:07:03,692 --> 00:07:05,653
If so, Yining,

77
00:07:05,824 --> 00:07:07,210
do you have a way to rescue her?

78
00:07:07,372 --> 00:07:09,692
If Her Highness didn't want
to establish a marital alliance,

79
00:07:09,892 --> 00:07:11,372
Yixiu would've been detained

80
00:07:11,373 --> 00:07:12,652
for nothing.

81
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:15,293
But I think Young Master Han

82
00:07:15,892 --> 00:07:17,293
fancies Yixiu.

83
00:07:19,533 --> 00:07:21,572
Does he truly fancy her?

84
00:07:23,372 --> 00:07:24,372
What do you mean?

85
00:07:24,692 --> 00:07:25,492
Think about it.

86
00:07:25,613 --> 00:07:27,733
He only develops an appetite

87
00:07:27,733 --> 00:07:29,132
when he sees Sixth Sister eating.

88
00:07:29,246 --> 00:07:31,566
What if we cure him of his condition?

89
00:07:32,294 --> 00:07:33,163
Doesn't that mean

90
00:07:33,173 --> 00:07:34,853
he'll stop fancying Sixth Sister?

91
00:07:44,173 --> 00:07:46,372
Young Master Lin,
why don't you cut to the chase?

92
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,001
Don't tell me

93
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,639
this vial contains poison?

94
00:07:51,853 --> 00:07:53,533
This is a medicine used
to treat anorexia.

95
00:07:53,584 --> 00:07:55,970
I only managed to complete it
after pulling several all-nighters.

96
00:07:56,533 --> 00:07:57,932
You better know what's good for you.

97
00:07:58,213 --> 00:08:00,653
Why are you suddenly being kind to me?

98
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,410
Did Sixth Lady instruct you
to deliver this to me?

99
00:08:05,936 --> 00:08:07,660
I delivered it to you
for Sixth Lady's sake.

100
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,304
Madam Chen wishes to establish
a marital alliance with Her Highness.

101
00:08:10,304 --> 00:08:11,808
Sixth Lady wasn't willing to comply.

102
00:08:11,856 --> 00:08:13,050
She was locked inside her room.

103
00:08:13,053 --> 00:08:14,692
It's been a few days since then.

104
00:08:14,692 --> 00:08:15,572
How could that be?

105
00:08:18,533 --> 00:08:19,332
Wait.

106
00:08:20,621 --> 00:08:21,421
Why isn't Sixth Lady

107
00:08:22,132 --> 00:08:23,093
willing to comply?

108
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:25,568
Are you willing to comply, then?

109
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:27,440
Of course.

110
00:08:28,413 --> 00:08:29,613
Do you fancy Sixth Lady?

111
00:08:29,892 --> 00:08:30,692
I do.

112
00:08:30,853 --> 00:08:32,173
Sixth Lady is bubbly and adorable.

113
00:08:32,173 --> 00:08:33,289
Of course I fancy her.

114
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:35,780
I'm willing to marry her and treat
her nicely for the rest of my life.

115
00:08:35,782 --> 00:08:37,463
But what if she's depressed,

116
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:38,590
has no appetite,

117
00:08:38,832 --> 00:08:40,650
and can't enjoy meals with you
in the future?

118
00:08:40,752 --> 00:08:42,130
Will you still fancy her by then?

119
00:08:42,272 --> 00:08:44,050
Will you still be willing
to treat her nicely?

120
00:08:48,134 --> 00:08:49,369
Now, you fancy her.

121
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:50,640
You wish to be together with her.

122
00:08:50,852 --> 00:08:51,852
It's just because she helps

123
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:53,212
you develop an appetite.

124
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,210
You see, there's no goal
when you fancy someone.

125
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:57,728
Instead, you'll be willing
to sacrifice yourself

126
00:08:57,852 --> 00:08:59,053
for her sake.

127
00:09:00,288 --> 00:09:01,696
Are you willing to do so?

128
00:09:02,692 --> 00:09:03,452
I...

129
00:09:03,812 --> 00:09:04,373
You hesitated.

130
00:09:04,533 --> 00:09:05,529
You're not decisive enough.

131
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:07,040
You're weighing the pros and cons now.

132
00:09:11,212 --> 00:09:12,212
If so, I...

133
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,840
Actually, I don't fancy Sixth Lady.

134
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:17,533
Not only that,

135
00:09:17,732 --> 00:09:19,173
but she also doesn't fancy you.

136
00:09:19,344 --> 00:09:21,530
If not, she wouldn't have been
detained by her mother

137
00:09:21,533 --> 00:09:22,972
because she resisted her order.

138
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:25,610
Although one's marriage
is decided by their parents

139
00:09:25,612 --> 00:09:26,533
and the matchmaker,

140
00:09:27,612 --> 00:09:28,812
if one can spend their lives

141
00:09:28,812 --> 00:09:30,852
with their beloved until old age,

142
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:33,332
I suppose that's a happy ending.

143
00:09:35,373 --> 00:09:36,533
I believe you won't get married

144
00:09:36,533 --> 00:09:37,612
with a meal buddy, right?

145
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,520
I need to consider this carefully.

146
00:09:42,533 --> 00:09:43,812
You have to.

147
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,361
Don't ruin your life

148
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:46,832
and harm Sixth Lady at the same time.

149
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,488
For this medicine,

150
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,439
you should take it one hour before meal.

151
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,200
I guarantee that you'll develop
a huge appetite.

152
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:54,608
If it doesn't work, find me again.

153
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,330
If so, thank you, Young Master Lin.

154
00:09:58,732 --> 00:09:59,413
Don't mention it.

155
00:09:59,968 --> 00:10:00,970
I'll make a move first.

156
00:10:02,896 --> 00:10:04,112
Take care, Young Master Lin.

157
00:10:32,165 --> 00:10:34,165
Have you met Sixth Lady today?

158
00:10:34,373 --> 00:10:35,212
No, I haven't.

159
00:10:35,373 --> 00:10:37,373
But you have a great appetite today.

160
00:10:38,812 --> 00:10:40,373
A friend of mine studies medicine.

161
00:10:40,893 --> 00:10:42,493
He gave me a prescription.

162
00:10:42,852 --> 00:10:44,332
He said it could cure my condition.

163
00:10:44,332 --> 00:10:45,533
At first, I didn't believe him.

164
00:10:45,572 --> 00:10:47,572
But when I gave it a try,
it was actually effective.

165
00:10:47,692 --> 00:10:49,692
Now, I develop a huge appetite
whenever I see food.

166
00:10:50,285 --> 00:10:51,326
Is that true?

167
00:10:51,328 --> 00:10:52,490
What kind of prescription is it?

168
00:10:52,496 --> 00:10:54,330
Have you let
the imperial physician examine it?

169
00:10:54,332 --> 00:10:56,640
I have. They said
the prescription was fine.

170
00:10:57,812 --> 00:10:59,013
That's great.

171
00:10:59,013 --> 00:11:00,212
Who's that friend of yours?

172
00:11:00,212 --> 00:11:01,812
I need to prepare a huge gift for him

173
00:11:01,812 --> 00:11:03,369
and thank him for his effort.

174
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:05,550
Mother, there's no need for that.
I've already thanked him.

175
00:11:08,932 --> 00:11:09,493
Mother,

176
00:11:10,212 --> 00:11:11,732
have you met up

177
00:11:12,692 --> 00:11:14,133
with Madam Chen lately?

178
00:11:15,253 --> 00:11:16,334
Madam Chen?

179
00:11:16,572 --> 00:11:18,293
She did visit me twice.

180
00:11:18,336 --> 00:11:19,570
She brought some snacks with her,

181
00:11:19,613 --> 00:11:20,493
saying that Sixth Lady

182
00:11:20,572 --> 00:11:21,932
made them for me.

183
00:11:23,932 --> 00:11:24,692
Zhao,

184
00:11:25,212 --> 00:11:27,053
do you fancy Sixth Lady?

185
00:11:27,332 --> 00:11:29,612
Why don't you marry her?

186
00:11:31,572 --> 00:11:32,373
Mother,

187
00:11:33,232 --> 00:11:34,530
let's put this aside for now.

188
00:11:34,912 --> 00:11:35,831
Put this aside?

189
00:11:36,133 --> 00:11:37,692
Do you not fancy Sixth Lady now?

190
00:11:39,133 --> 00:11:39,852
That's not it.

191
00:11:41,408 --> 00:11:42,970
Anyway, let's put it aside for now.

192
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:49,253
Mother, let's eat. I'm starving.

193
00:11:49,373 --> 00:11:51,209
All right. Let's eat.

194
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,584
Eating is the most important thing.
Here, give this a try.

195
00:11:56,533 --> 00:11:57,413
Sixth Lady

196
00:11:57,493 --> 00:11:59,612
has invented a new type of snack.

197
00:11:59,616 --> 00:12:02,210
She told me to bring it here
so that you could try it, Your Highness.

198
00:12:03,692 --> 00:12:05,612
Madam Chen, thank you so much.

199
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,133
I wonder if Young Master Han

200
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,240
has any appetite lately.

201
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:12,758
Yixiu said

202
00:12:12,814 --> 00:12:15,175
Young Master Han
loved sweet and sour food.

203
00:12:15,692 --> 00:12:18,212
She made some sweet and sour pastries

204
00:12:18,373 --> 00:12:19,329
just for him.

205
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:20,690
His appetite has been getting better.

206
00:12:20,692 --> 00:12:22,173
Thank you for being concerned about him.

207
00:12:22,645 --> 00:12:24,006
Just look at the children.

208
00:12:24,224 --> 00:12:26,944
One of them loves preparing food
while the other loves eating them.

209
00:12:27,932 --> 00:12:30,212
They do feel like a good match,
don't they?

210
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,559
Madam Chen,

211
00:12:34,949 --> 00:12:36,829
I do like Sixth Lady.

212
00:12:37,086 --> 00:12:39,006
But you see, when it comes to marriage,

213
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,530
we should ask the children
whether they fancy each other or not.

214
00:12:41,812 --> 00:12:43,893
If they do fancy each other,

215
00:12:43,894 --> 00:12:45,534
naturally, it'll be a great match.

216
00:12:45,696 --> 00:12:47,530
However, if they're forced
to get married,

217
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:50,679
I'm afraid they won't lead
a good life in the future.

218
00:12:53,413 --> 00:12:56,373
Your Highness, you're right.

219
00:13:02,758 --> 00:13:04,638
Has Sixth Lady been
up to anything strange

220
00:13:04,852 --> 00:13:06,612
when she was locked inside her room?

221
00:13:07,212 --> 00:13:08,133
No, she hasn't.

222
00:13:09,632 --> 00:13:10,832
I'm sure she did something.

223
00:13:12,033 --> 00:13:12,832
If not,

224
00:13:13,248 --> 00:13:15,590
Her Highness wouldn't have said
something like that today.

225
00:13:17,073 --> 00:13:18,393
You better keep a close eye on her!

226
00:13:18,832 --> 00:13:19,433
Yes, Madam.

227
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:22,110
(Dedicated to Old Madam Luo)

228
00:13:22,112 --> 00:13:23,632
Young Lady Zhao

229
00:13:23,632 --> 00:13:26,033
is inviting the ladies
of the Luo's Residence

230
00:13:26,112 --> 00:13:28,592
to Duke Ying's Residence.

231
00:13:29,913 --> 00:13:33,112
This is Young Lady Zhao
of Duke Ying's Residence.

232
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:34,992
She's the precious daughter of the Duke.

233
00:13:35,793 --> 00:13:36,592
Mother,

234
00:13:36,672 --> 00:13:37,830
I heard that Young Lady Zhao

235
00:13:37,832 --> 00:13:39,393
isn't the daughter of Duke Ying.

236
00:13:39,832 --> 00:13:41,673
Zhao Mingzhu

237
00:13:41,673 --> 00:13:44,112
is the child

238
00:13:44,112 --> 00:13:45,913
of Old Madam Wei's fellow clan member.

239
00:13:46,153 --> 00:13:47,592
Duke Ying

240
00:13:47,592 --> 00:13:49,232
is constantly fighting in wars.

241
00:13:49,232 --> 00:13:51,193
He never got married
or had any children.

242
00:13:51,193 --> 00:13:52,512
Old Madam Wei

243
00:13:52,673 --> 00:13:54,872
took this child in
and raised her as her own grandchild.

244
00:13:55,033 --> 00:13:57,872
Although she's not biologically related
to them, they're very close.

245
00:13:58,033 --> 00:13:59,313
I thought he had a son.

246
00:13:59,953 --> 00:14:02,592
That's the child of his maid.

247
00:14:03,073 --> 00:14:05,033
Duke Ying is pretty strange

248
00:14:05,112 --> 00:14:06,193
for not getting married.

249
00:14:06,472 --> 00:14:08,313
I heard that he doesn't even
have a mistress.

250
00:14:08,832 --> 00:14:09,832
Enough already.

251
00:14:09,953 --> 00:14:12,793
We should stay out of
other people's family affairs.

252
00:14:15,193 --> 00:14:16,673
I've always respected

253
00:14:16,712 --> 00:14:19,632
Old Madam Wei.

254
00:14:19,872 --> 00:14:21,509
She once led an army to battle.

255
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,920
She spoke and acted with determination.

256
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:25,230
She was definitely
a heroine of the state.

257
00:14:25,393 --> 00:14:26,953
Due to that, you guys must respond

258
00:14:27,232 --> 00:14:29,553
to Young Lady Zhao's
invitation for her sake.

259
00:14:29,832 --> 00:14:31,472
Therefore, when you guys are there,

260
00:14:31,472 --> 00:14:33,313
you have to be careful.

261
00:14:33,512 --> 00:14:35,073
Treat the encounter seriously.

262
00:14:35,472 --> 00:14:36,592
- Yes, Mother.
- Yes, Mother.

263
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:40,913
Where's Yixiu? Why isn't she here?

264
00:14:42,033 --> 00:14:44,352
She's been sick lately.

265
00:14:44,352 --> 00:14:46,193
I told her to stay in her room

266
00:14:46,193 --> 00:14:48,073
so that she wouldn't infect the others.

267
00:14:48,793 --> 00:14:50,992
Has the physician examined her, then?

268
00:14:51,033 --> 00:14:52,073
Yes.

269
00:14:52,112 --> 00:14:54,512
It's nothing major. It's just a cold.

270
00:14:54,832 --> 00:14:55,592
All right.

271
00:15:05,632 --> 00:15:06,953
(Han Zhao accepted my medicine.)

272
00:15:07,033 --> 00:15:08,433
(His condition has been cured.)

273
00:15:08,752 --> 00:15:10,793
(I don't think he'll agree
to the marriage now.)

274
00:15:16,592 --> 00:15:18,033
You're a noble lady, you know?

275
00:15:18,033 --> 00:15:19,789
Where did you learn all this from?

276
00:15:19,790 --> 00:15:21,040
How dare you keep hidden notes?

277
00:15:23,112 --> 00:15:25,632
I wrote them as I was too bored.

278
00:15:26,232 --> 00:15:28,512
Someone! Capture this goose

279
00:15:28,512 --> 00:15:29,273
and cook it!

280
00:15:29,393 --> 00:15:30,872
- Fugui, run!
- Hurry!

281
00:15:30,872 --> 00:15:32,953
Fugui, run! Don't let them capture you!

282
00:15:32,953 --> 00:15:33,393
Fugui!

283
00:15:33,953 --> 00:15:35,073
Nobody touches Fugui!

284
00:15:35,537 --> 00:15:36,177
You!

285
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,953
Since it entered my territory,
it's mine now!

286
00:15:38,954 --> 00:15:40,434
I'll make some goose soup tonight!

287
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,140
Get out of the way!

288
00:15:41,352 --> 00:15:41,872
Scram!

289
00:15:41,992 --> 00:15:42,512
Nobody moves!

290
00:15:45,024 --> 00:15:46,590
I'll fight those who dare to touch Fugui

291
00:15:46,592 --> 00:15:47,592
to the end!

292
00:15:48,273 --> 00:15:49,512
Come inside right now.

293
00:15:51,232 --> 00:15:53,033
Don't be scared. I'll return soon.

294
00:16:04,872 --> 00:16:05,632
Lan.

295
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:08,872
It's just an animal.

296
00:16:09,296 --> 00:16:10,590
Animals don't know how to reason.

297
00:16:10,872 --> 00:16:12,632
Why are you holding a grudge against it?

298
00:16:14,872 --> 00:16:17,313
Madam Lin, I only have one purpose

299
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:18,512
for inviting you here today.

300
00:16:18,793 --> 00:16:21,273
Young Master Lin
used his goose as a messenger

301
00:16:21,273 --> 00:16:22,592
to lead Yixiu astray

302
00:16:22,872 --> 00:16:24,073
and ruin her marriage.

303
00:16:24,393 --> 00:16:26,433
I don't think there's a grudge between

304
00:16:26,472 --> 00:16:27,592
our families.

305
00:16:27,832 --> 00:16:29,512
May I know why Young Master Lin

306
00:16:29,512 --> 00:16:31,953
is engaging in such
sneaky and underhanded activities?

307
00:16:42,128 --> 00:16:43,840
(Han Zhao accepted my medicine.
His condition has been cured.)

308
00:16:45,112 --> 00:16:46,512
I merely did a kind deed.

309
00:16:46,752 --> 00:16:49,073
I gave Han Zhao a prescription
and cured his condition.

310
00:16:54,592 --> 00:16:55,592
There's no helping it.

311
00:16:56,112 --> 00:16:57,712
My brother has been kind since young.

312
00:16:58,112 --> 00:17:00,112
He couldn't stand it when people suffer.

313
00:17:00,832 --> 00:17:03,992
Coincidentally,
he has some medical skills as well.

314
00:17:04,913 --> 00:17:06,272
Lan, if you're upset about it,

315
00:17:06,873 --> 00:17:08,953
I'll join you in heading
to Her Highness's Residence

316
00:17:09,232 --> 00:17:11,992
and retrieve the medicine
meant for Young Master Han, then.

317
00:17:12,117 --> 00:17:13,797
There's no need for you
to be this angry.

318
00:17:15,752 --> 00:17:17,873
Don't try to threaten me
with Her Highness's name.

319
00:17:18,312 --> 00:17:19,433
As the first principal wife,

320
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:22,630
I never wanted to be involved with you.

321
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,593
Madam Lin, I hope you can keep

322
00:17:24,593 --> 00:17:26,272
a close eye on your brother
in the future.

323
00:17:26,272 --> 00:17:28,312
Do not ruin the Luo's Residence

324
00:17:28,312 --> 00:17:29,913
and the Lin Family's reputation.

325
00:17:32,272 --> 00:17:33,512
Thank you for the reminder.

326
00:17:34,272 --> 00:17:35,752
I also have some advice for you.

327
00:17:36,752 --> 00:17:38,528
Nothing forcibly done
is going to be agreeable.

328
00:17:38,792 --> 00:17:40,593
If you keep restraining Sixth Lady
like this,

329
00:17:40,792 --> 00:17:42,272
something bad will occur eventually.

330
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,390
I don't need other people
to tell me what to do

331
00:17:45,953 --> 00:17:47,433
regarding my daughter's marriage.

332
00:17:48,272 --> 00:17:49,312
I'll drop the issue today.

333
00:17:49,992 --> 00:17:50,792
In the future,

334
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:53,120
one should pray
that he won't let me find out

335
00:17:53,168 --> 00:17:54,910
that he's trying
to dupe my daughter again.

336
00:17:54,953 --> 00:17:56,393
If not, I'll show him no mercy.

337
00:18:01,193 --> 00:18:02,792
Ms. Zhao, see them off.

338
00:18:03,552 --> 00:18:04,353
Thank you.

339
00:18:04,712 --> 00:18:05,833
Take your letter. Let's go.

340
00:18:07,873 --> 00:18:08,433
Fugui.

341
00:18:08,992 --> 00:18:09,792
Let's go.

342
00:18:12,675 --> 00:18:15,596
(Caifu Abode)

343
00:18:16,113 --> 00:18:17,272
What's wrong with you?

344
00:18:17,272 --> 00:18:19,272
Why are you sabotaging
Sixth Lady's marriage?

345
00:18:19,752 --> 00:18:20,792
I didn't.

346
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:22,833
I'm trying to help her out.

347
00:18:23,072 --> 00:18:24,992
Help her? Or are you trying
to help yourself out?

348
00:18:26,544 --> 00:18:28,464
I just don't want her
to be married to Han Zhao.

349
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,168
When I think that she's
getting married to him,

350
00:18:31,272 --> 00:18:33,072
I can't eat or sleep.

351
00:18:33,272 --> 00:18:35,433
- I feel terrible.
- Do you feel good now?

352
00:18:36,193 --> 00:18:37,512
I told you before.

353
00:18:37,512 --> 00:18:39,193
Chen Lan despises the Lin Family.

354
00:18:39,193 --> 00:18:40,633
Moreover, you're not an official.

355
00:18:40,633 --> 00:18:42,633
How could she betroth Sixth Lady to you?

356
00:18:42,752 --> 00:18:45,072
I can also make a name for myself
as a merchant.

357
00:18:45,344 --> 00:18:47,790
Although Chen Lan appears
to be uncompetitive on the surface,

358
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:49,113
she's proud and arrogant.

359
00:18:49,193 --> 00:18:50,512
She despises even the Liu Family.

360
00:18:50,512 --> 00:18:52,199
How could she take a liking
to the Lin Family

361
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,520
when we're a family of merchants?

362
00:18:55,072 --> 00:18:56,472
I suggest you give up on her.

363
00:18:56,873 --> 00:18:59,389
I could still do something about it
if it's someone else.

364
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:01,264
But I can't do anything
about Chen Lan's daughter.

365
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:01,750
Hairu.

366
00:19:02,272 --> 00:19:03,913
I know you won't leave me in the lurch.

367
00:19:23,472 --> 00:19:24,272
Young Lady,

368
00:19:25,272 --> 00:19:27,433
did something occur within the shop?

369
00:19:29,113 --> 00:19:30,193
I was wondering about

370
00:19:30,992 --> 00:19:32,833
the invitation to Duke Ying's Residence.

371
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,310
Is there something wrong with
Young Lady Zhao's invitation?

372
00:19:37,953 --> 00:19:39,113
Do you still remember

373
00:19:39,433 --> 00:19:40,712
who Zhao Mingzhu

374
00:19:40,992 --> 00:19:42,792
came to our residence with last time?

375
00:19:43,433 --> 00:19:44,312
Lu Jiaxue?

376
00:19:45,873 --> 00:19:46,873
Are you worried

377
00:19:46,873 --> 00:19:48,833
that he instructed
Young Lady Zhao to do so?

378
00:19:49,992 --> 00:19:51,913
Although Duke Ying and Lu Jiaxue

379
00:19:51,992 --> 00:19:54,113
appear to have different political views
on the court,

380
00:19:54,312 --> 00:19:56,512
the two families had always
been close to each other.

381
00:19:58,312 --> 00:20:00,232
Zhao Mingzhu gave us
a sudden invitation.

382
00:20:00,393 --> 00:20:02,752
And, only the ladies
of the Luo's Residence were invited.

383
00:20:03,232 --> 00:20:04,072
I think

384
00:20:04,433 --> 00:20:06,433
there must be something off about it.

385
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,790
If so, Young Lady,
will you still show up?

386
00:20:08,992 --> 00:20:10,433
If I reject her today,

387
00:20:10,593 --> 00:20:11,913
she'll invite me again tomorrow.

388
00:20:12,113 --> 00:20:13,269
If I reject her tomorrow,

389
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,950
she'll invite me again
the day after tomorrow.

390
00:20:15,953 --> 00:20:17,232
There's no avoiding her.

391
00:20:18,003 --> 00:20:20,736
(Duke Ying's Residence)

392
00:20:27,113 --> 00:20:29,189
Duke Ying's Residence
does live up to its reputation.

393
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:31,344
Even their main gate
looks much grander than the usual.

394
00:20:31,392 --> 00:20:33,910
Anyone who's born into
a family like this

395
00:20:33,992 --> 00:20:36,032
must've saved the world
in their past lives.

396
00:20:36,113 --> 00:20:37,792
You should be grateful

397
00:20:37,873 --> 00:20:39,953
that you're born into the Luo Family.

398
00:20:40,288 --> 00:20:42,270
Put away
that unpresentable demeanor of yours

399
00:20:42,752 --> 00:20:45,113
when we enter the residence later.

400
00:20:53,072 --> 00:20:54,512
Greetings, ladies.

401
00:20:55,408 --> 00:20:57,430
My young lady is waiting for you all
at the Yi Garden.

402
00:20:57,433 --> 00:20:58,312
Please follow me.

403
00:20:58,712 --> 00:20:59,792
Please lead the way.

404
00:21:03,953 --> 00:21:04,792
Duke Ying,

405
00:21:05,312 --> 00:21:07,512
I've received some rare
Longyuan Shengxue Tea lately.

406
00:21:07,593 --> 00:21:08,953
Since you loved tea,

407
00:21:09,113 --> 00:21:10,393
I brought them here as a gift.

408
00:21:15,873 --> 00:21:17,433
Jiaxue, I appreciate your effort.

409
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:22,113
Ever since you allied yourself
with Chancellor Wang,

410
00:21:22,512 --> 00:21:23,633
forget about having tea,

411
00:21:24,792 --> 00:21:27,472
we hardly even have the chance
to meet each other.

412
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:30,712
Duke Ying,

413
00:21:31,272 --> 00:21:32,312
I know

414
00:21:33,113 --> 00:21:34,752
you're still upset with me

415
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:35,953
regarding Chen Daoyan's death.

416
00:21:36,232 --> 00:21:37,272
However,

417
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,230
Chancellor Wang was supposed
to oversee the case himself.

418
00:21:40,712 --> 00:21:42,272
I was just following his order.

419
00:21:42,712 --> 00:21:43,472
Duke Ying,

420
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:45,990
you didn't need to get yourself
involved in this mess.

421
00:21:47,953 --> 00:21:49,113
To be honest with you,

422
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:50,913
I did spend some time

423
00:21:51,113 --> 00:21:52,992
with Chen Jiuheng before.

424
00:21:52,992 --> 00:21:53,913
I believe

425
00:21:54,113 --> 00:21:56,633
that he isn't a greedy
and unscrupulous person.

426
00:21:57,113 --> 00:22:00,032
Chen Jiuheng submitted a memorial
regarding the abnormal tea tax.

427
00:22:00,433 --> 00:22:02,833
But in the end? He was convicted of

428
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:05,272
embezzling the funds meant for
disaster relief soon after.

429
00:22:05,913 --> 00:22:07,472
Since then, no one dared to say anything

430
00:22:07,472 --> 00:22:09,312
about the tea tax.

431
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:11,113
That caused

432
00:22:11,472 --> 00:22:14,472
the production of tea leaves
to increase rapidly

433
00:22:14,992 --> 00:22:17,833
while the tea tax was reduced.

434
00:22:18,833 --> 00:22:21,072
Nobody knows how many people
have profited

435
00:22:21,113 --> 00:22:22,193
from this endeavor alone.

436
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:24,433
Jiaxue,

437
00:22:25,072 --> 00:22:26,393
you should know

438
00:22:26,873 --> 00:22:27,833
that the tea tax

439
00:22:27,953 --> 00:22:29,953
is an important source
of military supplies.

440
00:22:30,096 --> 00:22:32,128
What can I use to defend our state
against our enemies

441
00:22:32,232 --> 00:22:33,992
if we lack sufficient military supplies?

442
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,200
Duke Ying, I understand your concern.

443
00:22:37,712 --> 00:22:39,230
But this has gone on for some time.

444
00:22:39,593 --> 00:22:40,593
It's not that easy

445
00:22:41,072 --> 00:22:42,153
to turn it around.

446
00:22:46,232 --> 00:22:47,032
Jiaxue,

447
00:22:48,512 --> 00:22:50,953
your father and I were close friends.

448
00:22:51,312 --> 00:22:53,712
That's why I'll give you a reminder.

449
00:22:54,433 --> 00:22:56,953
If you get too close
to a certain individual,

450
00:22:57,873 --> 00:23:00,393
you'll be endangering yourself as well.

451
00:23:08,593 --> 00:23:09,593
Duke Ying, don't worry.

452
00:23:09,913 --> 00:23:11,072
I know what I'm doing.

453
00:23:14,072 --> 00:23:15,593
But Duke Ying,

454
00:23:18,208 --> 00:23:19,750
since you're involving yourself in this,

455
00:23:20,593 --> 00:23:22,512
you have to be extra careful
in the future.

456
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,030
You want me to be careful?

457
00:23:28,272 --> 00:23:29,272
Did you actually say that?

458
00:23:33,433 --> 00:23:34,873
You should understand

459
00:23:35,992 --> 00:23:38,992
that the Wei Family
gained its reputation

460
00:23:39,113 --> 00:23:41,433
from risking our lives
on the battlefield

461
00:23:41,472 --> 00:23:44,113
for generations.

462
00:23:44,752 --> 00:23:46,193
I don't even fear death.

463
00:23:47,113 --> 00:23:48,433
What should I be careful about?

464
00:24:06,032 --> 00:24:08,312
What's with all the strangers
in the residence?

465
00:24:08,768 --> 00:24:09,790
Young Lady Mingzhu invited

466
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:11,840
the ladies of the Luo's Residence
to visit her here.

467
00:24:12,072 --> 00:24:13,069
Which Luo's Residence?

468
00:24:13,070 --> 00:24:14,589
The one with the top scholar,

469
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:16,790
the one with Registrar Luo
of Imperial Court of Judicial.

470
00:24:23,424 --> 00:24:25,550
They have quite a lot
of female members, don't they?

471
00:24:25,792 --> 00:24:27,393
We don't leave our residence usually.

472
00:24:27,552 --> 00:24:29,272
Due to that, I thought
our centennial garden

473
00:24:29,272 --> 00:24:30,312
was considered amazing.

474
00:24:30,393 --> 00:24:33,113
Now that I'm lucky enough
to explore Duke Ying's garden myself,

475
00:24:33,193 --> 00:24:34,472
I found out how ignorant I was.

476
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:35,953
It has truly broadened my horizons.

477
00:24:36,072 --> 00:24:37,913
The garden in Luo's Residence
is pretty nice.

478
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:39,552
However, our Yi Garden

479
00:24:39,953 --> 00:24:41,913
is cultivated by palace personnel.

480
00:24:42,193 --> 00:24:43,472
Naturally, it's different.

481
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,910
Duke Ying has rendered
countless military merit.

482
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:47,420
He's favored by His Majesty as well.

483
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,624
I'm afraid no one in the court

484
00:24:48,672 --> 00:24:50,320
can compare to him.

485
00:24:55,072 --> 00:24:56,992
Ting, that was careless of you.

486
00:24:57,552 --> 00:24:58,433
Mingzhu, are you here

487
00:24:58,433 --> 00:25:00,072
to play shuttlecock with me?

488
00:25:00,113 --> 00:25:00,913
Ting,

489
00:25:00,913 --> 00:25:02,552
I'm entertaining my guests right now.

490
00:25:02,552 --> 00:25:04,552
I'll play with you later, okay?

491
00:25:04,552 --> 00:25:05,472
Young boy,

492
00:25:06,072 --> 00:25:08,032
your shuttlecock looks nice.

493
00:25:08,232 --> 00:25:10,593
Did you put two coins inside?

494
00:25:10,992 --> 00:25:11,913
I put three coins.

495
00:25:12,272 --> 00:25:13,633
You're amazing, then.

496
00:25:13,710 --> 00:25:14,960
This shuttlecock is very heavy.

497
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,736
Ordinary people
can't even attempt to play it.

498
00:25:16,752 --> 00:25:18,032
Can you do it, then?

499
00:25:18,232 --> 00:25:19,032
I'll give it a try.

500
00:25:20,633 --> 00:25:21,113
Come.

501
00:25:28,232 --> 00:25:30,552
My seventh sister
loved to play since young.

502
00:25:30,752 --> 00:25:32,913
She's used to playing around
without observing decency.

503
00:25:32,913 --> 00:25:34,072
Sorry for the embarrassment.

504
00:25:34,072 --> 00:25:35,633
Was she like this since young?

505
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,830
She was a little bully

506
00:25:37,833 --> 00:25:39,752
since young.

507
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:41,312
She was used to being willful

508
00:25:41,328 --> 00:25:42,640
as Grandma had spoiled her.

509
00:25:48,633 --> 00:25:49,433
Is that so?

510
00:25:51,113 --> 00:25:51,913
She was...

511
00:25:55,153 --> 00:25:56,593
competitive since young.

512
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:10,072
Young Lady, I'm sorry!
I deserved to be punished!

513
00:26:11,472 --> 00:26:12,913
How are you so careless?

514
00:26:15,433 --> 00:26:16,353
Thank you, Young Lady.

515
00:26:18,272 --> 00:26:19,072
Lu Jiaxue,

516
00:26:19,232 --> 00:26:21,472
I went out and played with
some foxtail grass today.

517
00:26:21,775 --> 00:26:23,295
But suddenly, my body feels itchy.

518
00:26:24,433 --> 00:26:25,552
What's going on?

519
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,430
Does it still itch?

520
00:26:35,752 --> 00:26:36,792
Seventh Lady, are you okay?

521
00:26:40,992 --> 00:26:42,393
You look quite pale.

522
00:26:42,712 --> 00:26:44,833
Are you unwell?

523
00:26:45,328 --> 00:26:46,870
Marquis Lu, thank you for the concern.

524
00:26:47,232 --> 00:26:49,472
Maybe I haven't fully recovered

525
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:50,593
from my illness yet.

526
00:26:51,032 --> 00:26:52,953
And, I think it's too windy today.

527
00:26:53,232 --> 00:26:54,032
Why don't I

528
00:26:54,353 --> 00:26:55,909
hire a physician for you?

529
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:57,504
Marquis Lu, please don't
trouble yourself.

530
00:26:57,536 --> 00:26:59,190
We're returning to our residence.

531
00:26:59,232 --> 00:27:00,072
Seventh Lady.

532
00:27:01,936 --> 00:27:03,648
Regarding the things you said
on that day,

533
00:27:03,873 --> 00:27:05,032
what did you mean by that?

534
00:27:05,792 --> 00:27:07,792
Marquis Lu, I wonder
which day you're referring to.

535
00:27:16,232 --> 00:27:17,232
That day, you said,

536
00:27:18,433 --> 00:27:20,913
"At most, I'll die again."

537
00:27:21,232 --> 00:27:22,752
Even if I were to

538
00:27:23,752 --> 00:27:25,113
die again today,

539
00:27:26,433 --> 00:27:29,393
I won't let you hold me hostage
and blackmail Third Brother!

540
00:27:30,752 --> 00:27:31,552
Maybe

541
00:27:31,873 --> 00:27:33,873
it's because
I was seriously ill previously.

542
00:27:33,992 --> 00:27:35,072
Since my life was in danger,

543
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,160
maybe I spouted some nonsense on a whim.

544
00:27:40,593 --> 00:27:41,393
Qing Qu,

545
00:27:41,552 --> 00:27:43,833
let's hurry and bid farewell
to Young Lady Zhao.

546
00:28:06,992 --> 00:28:08,472
He's so cruel.

547
00:28:08,512 --> 00:28:10,552
He knew that I was allergic
to foxtail grass.

548
00:28:10,552 --> 00:28:11,953
Even so, he used it to test me.

549
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,839
I barely held it in just now.

550
00:28:15,032 --> 00:28:16,032
My hands are so itchy.

551
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,080
Young Lady, you should hurry
and take your medicine.

552
00:28:20,873 --> 00:28:22,913
Now, he's even more suspicious of me.

553
00:28:23,072 --> 00:28:24,833
We have to be wary of him in the future.

554
00:28:27,752 --> 00:28:29,393
Young Lady, Third Young Master is here.

555
00:28:30,353 --> 00:28:31,193
Tell him to leave.

556
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:33,232
Why can't I be here?

557
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:36,336
I heard that you returned from
Duke Ying's Residence abruptly.

558
00:28:39,913 --> 00:28:40,992
Why are you hiding your face?

559
00:28:41,072 --> 00:28:42,913
There are rashes on my face.

560
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:44,336
That's why I returned in advance.

561
00:28:45,752 --> 00:28:47,232
What are you doing here

562
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:48,792
instead of studying in your room?

563
00:28:55,552 --> 00:28:56,752
What's with the sudden rashes?

564
00:28:58,593 --> 00:28:59,953
Shao'an, go and get the medicine.

565
00:28:59,953 --> 00:29:00,992
It's fine. No need for that.

566
00:29:00,992 --> 00:29:02,393
Qing Qu already gave me some medicine.

567
00:29:02,393 --> 00:29:04,272
- I'll be fine after taking it.
- Hurry and go.

568
00:29:18,393 --> 00:29:19,232
Does it still itch?

569
00:29:25,752 --> 00:29:27,032
What's with the silly grin?

570
00:29:27,353 --> 00:29:29,232
Third Brother,
you treat me the best indeed.

571
00:29:29,913 --> 00:29:31,913
You have to be careful in the future.

572
00:29:32,153 --> 00:29:34,633
Tell them to take this with them
everywhere you guys go.

573
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,680
Xue Zhi,

574
00:29:37,953 --> 00:29:40,312
bring Third Brother's new outfit here.

575
00:29:41,072 --> 00:29:41,873
Third Brother,

576
00:29:41,873 --> 00:29:43,752
I made you some new outfits.

577
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:45,229
You can take them with you

578
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:46,880
when you attend
the imperial examination.

579
00:29:47,992 --> 00:29:49,193
I'll be taking an exam.

580
00:29:49,193 --> 00:29:50,792
Why should I take new outfits with me?

581
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:53,120
If I fail the exam, can I blame it
on the new outfits you make?

582
00:29:53,216 --> 00:29:54,240
Take it as a symbol of luck.

583
00:29:54,272 --> 00:29:55,272
By wearing them,

584
00:29:55,272 --> 00:29:56,752
it's as if I'm watching over you.

585
00:29:56,792 --> 00:29:58,232
So you can pass it
with flying colors.

586
00:30:00,721 --> 00:30:01,634
The mushroom you designed

587
00:30:01,634 --> 00:30:03,154
looks pretty good.

588
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,928
That's the leaf of a ginkgo tree.

589
00:30:06,873 --> 00:30:07,633
Forget it.

590
00:30:07,633 --> 00:30:09,272
You don't need
to take it if you dislike it.

591
00:30:09,273 --> 00:30:10,273
I can tell now.

592
00:30:10,913 --> 00:30:11,913
You already gave it to me.

593
00:30:11,913 --> 00:30:13,393
How could you take it back?

594
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:16,272
Stay inside the residence

595
00:30:16,512 --> 00:30:17,913
when I'm gone.

596
00:30:17,913 --> 00:30:19,393
Do not run around, understood?

597
00:30:20,232 --> 00:30:21,552
Just go and take your exam.

598
00:30:21,716 --> 00:30:22,916
Stop meddling with my affairs.

599
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,665
(A few days later)

600
00:30:31,869 --> 00:30:33,892
(Luo's Residence)

601
00:30:35,393 --> 00:30:36,792
Everyone, come and take a look!

602
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:38,299
It's great news for the Luo's Residence!

603
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:40,224
Luo Shenyuan is the top scorer
of the provincial exam!

604
00:30:40,224 --> 00:30:41,488
Great news for the Luo's Residence!

605
00:30:41,536 --> 00:30:43,584
Luo Shenyuan is the top scorer
of the provincial exam!

606
00:30:45,032 --> 00:30:46,913
I'm here to deliver
the golden flower post

607
00:30:46,913 --> 00:30:48,232
to you under the minister's order

608
00:30:48,232 --> 00:30:51,113
to congratulate Luo Shenyuan
on being the top scorer of the exam!

609
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,970
(Capital)

610
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,320
(Top Scorer, Luo Shenyuan)

611
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:55,992
My goodness.

612
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:58,312
You do intend to achieve
a triple success, huh?

613
00:30:59,153 --> 00:31:00,829
I'll notify Old Madam later.

614
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:02,608
We'll hold another
Top Scorer Feast for you.

615
00:31:03,552 --> 00:31:06,032
The Top Scholar Feast
was already luxurious enough.

616
00:31:06,032 --> 00:31:06,792
We should forget

617
00:31:07,363 --> 00:31:08,482
about the Top Scorer Feast.

618
00:31:09,072 --> 00:31:11,552
Achieving double success
is an honorable achievement, you know?

619
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:12,976
How could we just forget about it?

620
00:31:13,056 --> 00:31:15,750
There are plenty of people
who had achieved double success.

621
00:31:15,752 --> 00:31:17,113
Don't you think we're going too far

622
00:31:17,153 --> 00:31:18,792
by holding two feasts in a row?

623
00:31:19,247 --> 00:31:20,126
Am I going too far?

624
00:31:20,752 --> 00:31:21,833
I wonder who was the one

625
00:31:22,072 --> 00:31:24,353
who stared at the golden flower post
for so long

626
00:31:24,393 --> 00:31:25,752
until his eyes were going to pop.

627
00:31:33,193 --> 00:31:33,992
So,

628
00:31:34,393 --> 00:31:37,072
you can hold it if you like.
I'll follow your will. Happy now?

629
00:31:37,072 --> 00:31:37,752
All right.

630
00:31:38,032 --> 00:31:38,833
Mother.

631
00:31:39,705 --> 00:31:40,705
Father is right.

632
00:31:40,992 --> 00:31:42,393
We can forget about the feast.

633
00:31:42,608 --> 00:31:43,856
The imperial exam is nearing.

634
00:31:43,936 --> 00:31:44,990
I need to prepare for it.

635
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,520
My son, you're right.

636
00:31:49,913 --> 00:31:51,232
We'll hold a bigger feast for you

637
00:31:51,472 --> 00:31:53,552
once you become an imperial scholar.

638
00:31:55,153 --> 00:31:57,633
You agree with everything Shenyuan says.

639
00:31:57,633 --> 00:31:59,873
But you disagree
with everything I say, huh?

640
00:32:02,393 --> 00:32:03,433
Yeah, yeah.

641
00:32:03,593 --> 00:32:06,712
My dear, you like people
who can keep you happy.

642
00:32:07,232 --> 00:32:09,072
It's a shame that I don't know
how to do that.

643
00:32:12,752 --> 00:32:14,113
Enough already. Let's eat.

644
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:16,280
What?

645
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:19,278
Let's eat.

646
00:32:19,433 --> 00:32:20,232
You want us to eat?

647
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,961
Do you want to eat here?

648
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,880
Am I not allowed to eat here?

649
00:32:25,552 --> 00:32:26,353
That's not it.

650
00:32:27,552 --> 00:32:30,393
You've been visiting me
too often lately.

651
00:32:30,393 --> 00:32:32,353
I'm still not used to it.

652
00:32:34,531 --> 00:32:35,512
Yining, Shenyuan,

653
00:32:35,512 --> 00:32:37,232
you two should join us too.

654
00:32:37,232 --> 00:32:39,272
I'll instruct the cooks
to prepare a few more dishes.

655
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,960
We can celebrate
Shenyuan's success in advance.

656
00:32:42,904 --> 00:32:43,623
Okay.

657
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,101
(Study With Diligence)

658
00:32:49,193 --> 00:32:50,712
Xuan, what are you doing?

659
00:32:51,312 --> 00:32:52,312
Stop throwing them around!

660
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,320
Stop it!

661
00:33:01,992 --> 00:33:02,712
Father.

662
00:33:25,472 --> 00:33:26,913
It's fine that you failed the exam.

663
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,776
We just need to work harder next time

664
00:33:30,593 --> 00:33:31,752
and pass the exam.

665
00:33:33,424 --> 00:33:35,510
Why are you venting your anger
on the books?

666
00:33:35,992 --> 00:33:37,353
As literati,

667
00:33:37,472 --> 00:33:40,552
we have to respect the books.

668
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,184
Do you think you can pass the exam

669
00:33:45,353 --> 00:33:46,593
by throwing the books around?

670
00:34:02,512 --> 00:34:03,833
Keep all the books.

671
00:34:05,072 --> 00:34:05,873
Yilian,

672
00:34:06,433 --> 00:34:07,472
do not help him out.

673
00:34:08,072 --> 00:34:08,713
Yes, Father.

674
00:34:16,233 --> 00:34:17,389
What's wrong with her?

675
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:18,800
I assume she's received the letter.

676
00:34:19,592 --> 00:34:20,913
Her son failed the exam.

677
00:34:21,328 --> 00:34:23,904
She harbors the delusion that she'll
be accepted into the residence?

678
00:34:24,112 --> 00:34:25,592
She can keep on dreaming.

679
00:34:25,592 --> 00:34:26,992
She won't take her life, will she?

680
00:34:27,136 --> 00:34:28,390
If she does intend to do that,

681
00:34:28,393 --> 00:34:29,873
it'll be good for us.

682
00:34:29,913 --> 00:34:31,753
At least we don't need
to monitor her every day.

683
00:34:31,873 --> 00:34:32,552
Yeah.

684
00:34:32,592 --> 00:34:35,152
We have to report her situation
to Madam Chen every day, you know?

685
00:34:36,552 --> 00:34:37,753
Don't let her hear us.

686
00:34:37,753 --> 00:34:38,753
Let's go.

687
00:34:38,912 --> 00:34:39,504
Let's go.

688
00:34:47,436 --> 00:34:50,889
(Luo Xuanyuan failed the provincial examination
and did not qualify as a tribute scholar)

689
00:35:21,032 --> 00:35:22,192
I never expected

690
00:35:22,353 --> 00:35:23,953
Luo Shenyuan

691
00:35:24,353 --> 00:35:26,112
to become a grand provincial scholar.

692
00:35:26,552 --> 00:35:28,592
If he becomes an imperial scholar
in the future,

693
00:35:28,873 --> 00:35:30,753
he'll become the head

694
00:35:31,112 --> 00:35:32,552
of the Luo Family in the future.

695
00:35:33,072 --> 00:35:35,793
I told you to investigate whether or not
that girl was a premature baby.

696
00:35:35,913 --> 00:35:36,913
How did it go?

697
00:35:37,793 --> 00:35:38,873
Strangely enough,

698
00:35:39,032 --> 00:35:40,953
the old servants of Madam Gu

699
00:35:41,393 --> 00:35:43,072
had all vanished without a trace.

700
00:35:43,152 --> 00:35:44,550
I had no way to acquire information.

701
00:35:44,552 --> 00:35:46,512
It's impossible for them
to vanish without a trace

702
00:35:46,512 --> 00:35:47,632
unless they're dead.

703
00:35:47,968 --> 00:35:49,190
Continue your investigation.

704
00:35:49,913 --> 00:35:50,353
Yes, Madam.

705
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:51,320
And,

706
00:35:51,793 --> 00:35:53,192
try to locate the midwife

707
00:35:53,248 --> 00:35:54,512
who delivered her back then.

708
00:35:54,512 --> 00:35:55,112
Understood.

709
00:35:55,753 --> 00:35:56,992
That lass Luo Yining,

710
00:35:57,024 --> 00:35:59,376
I'll let her off as long as
she doesn't create trouble for me.

711
00:35:59,592 --> 00:36:01,152
But if she does provoke me one day,

712
00:36:01,873 --> 00:36:03,833
I have my own way
of keeping her in check.

713
00:36:04,833 --> 00:36:07,753
If Luo Shenyuan is able to become
the head of the family in the future,

714
00:36:07,913 --> 00:36:08,913
we won't be able to lead

715
00:36:08,913 --> 00:36:10,112
comfortable lives.

716
00:36:11,713 --> 00:36:13,753
Shan is a useless fool.

717
00:36:13,913 --> 00:36:16,454
And, we still have a long way
to go before we can determine

718
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,704
whether Yu will marry into
the Count's Residence or not.

719
00:36:19,472 --> 00:36:20,273
As for Xiu...

720
00:37:10,632 --> 00:37:12,913
Young Master Han,

721
00:37:13,953 --> 00:37:16,152
I don't know what Mother had told you.

722
00:37:17,032 --> 00:37:19,992
There's something I need to tell you...

723
00:37:28,233 --> 00:37:29,072
You want to tell me

724
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:31,390
that you don't wish
to be married to me, right?

725
00:37:35,713 --> 00:37:37,072
Young Master Lin had already told me

726
00:37:37,072 --> 00:37:38,112
about it.

727
00:37:38,352 --> 00:37:39,552
But I think it only counts

728
00:37:39,913 --> 00:37:41,592
if I hear it from you personally.

729
00:37:43,393 --> 00:37:45,032
Young Master Han, I'm sorry.

730
00:37:45,512 --> 00:37:47,072
I've always taken you as my friend.

731
00:37:47,344 --> 00:37:49,230
I never intended
to have a relationship with you.

732
00:37:49,273 --> 00:37:51,552
I didn't expect to implicate you
in the end.

733
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:55,472
I'm sorry.

734
00:37:57,833 --> 00:37:58,992
You don't need to apologize.

735
00:37:59,872 --> 00:38:01,744
You'll always be an important person
in my life

736
00:38:01,833 --> 00:38:03,472
no matter the result.

737
00:38:03,792 --> 00:38:06,320
But your mother had devoted
a lot of effort to set up this date.

738
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:08,432
I worry she'll make it hard
for you if I don't come.

739
00:38:08,552 --> 00:38:09,393
But don't worry.

740
00:38:09,552 --> 00:38:10,833
I've explained it to my mother.

741
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:13,408
I don't want you

742
00:38:14,393 --> 00:38:15,472
to be upset.

743
00:38:16,913 --> 00:38:18,152
Thank you, Young Master Han.

744
00:38:18,304 --> 00:38:19,510
I'm sure you'll find a partner

745
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,960
who can laugh and eat more than me
in the future.

746
00:38:37,953 --> 00:38:39,913
I never knew that you could row boats.

747
00:38:40,433 --> 00:38:41,873
You're pretty good at it too.

748
00:38:43,233 --> 00:38:44,192
To you,

749
00:38:44,833 --> 00:38:46,353
am I a useless fool?

750
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,552
That's not true.

751
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,199
Great.

752
00:38:51,552 --> 00:38:53,472
I loved rowing boats when I was young.

753
00:38:53,472 --> 00:38:54,632
I often did it in my residence.

754
00:38:57,308 --> 00:38:58,109
Sixth Lady,

755
00:38:58,753 --> 00:38:59,793
do you want to try it?

756
00:39:02,472 --> 00:39:02,992
Sure.

757
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:48,072
Young Master Han is a perfect match
for Sixth Lady.

758
00:39:48,273 --> 00:39:48,793
Yeah.

759
00:39:48,793 --> 00:39:50,112
The weather is great as well.

760
00:39:50,393 --> 00:39:51,753
It's perfect for rowing boats.

761
00:39:51,753 --> 00:39:52,353
Indeed.

762
00:39:52,632 --> 00:39:54,873
They're a perfect match indeed.

763
00:39:59,512 --> 00:40:01,112
Don't you think it's a little...

764
00:40:03,592 --> 00:40:04,233
Sixth Lady!

765
00:40:05,353 --> 00:40:05,953
Watch out!

766
00:40:08,833 --> 00:40:10,833
- Help!
- Han Jiu!

767
00:40:10,833 --> 00:40:11,313
Young Lady!

768
00:40:11,592 --> 00:40:12,313
Young Lady!

769
00:40:12,313 --> 00:40:13,161
Help!

770
00:40:13,552 --> 00:40:14,192
Young Master!

771
00:40:14,753 --> 00:40:15,793
Someone! Save them!

772
00:40:15,793 --> 00:40:16,793
- Yes, sir!
- Save them!

773
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,510
Young Master!

774
00:40:17,512 --> 00:40:18,313
Someone!

775
00:40:23,433 --> 00:40:24,233
Young Lady!

776
00:40:26,512 --> 00:40:27,313
Young Lady!

777
00:40:33,192 --> 00:40:34,393
Someone!

778
00:40:34,472 --> 00:40:36,233
Sixth Lady has fallen into the water!

779
00:40:36,233 --> 00:40:36,789
Ms. Zhao!

780
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:37,776
Someone! Sixth Lady has...

781
00:40:37,824 --> 00:40:38,720
Ms. Zhao, you must stop!

782
00:40:39,192 --> 00:40:41,873
I need to save Young Lady! Someone!

783
00:40:41,873 --> 00:40:42,512
Young Lady!

784
00:40:42,753 --> 00:40:45,072
Come and save our lady!

785
00:40:45,072 --> 00:40:46,592
Someone!

786
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,679
Third Brother,

787
00:41:01,056 --> 00:41:02,590
have you finished
packing your belongings

788
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:03,744
for the imperial examination?

789
00:41:03,776 --> 00:41:05,024
Do you lack anything?

790
00:41:05,637 --> 00:41:06,429
Nope.

791
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:08,750
I haven't finished the essentials
you prepared last time.

792
00:41:08,753 --> 00:41:10,552
The imperial exam is up next.

793
00:41:10,552 --> 00:41:12,072
Don't feel pressured

794
00:41:12,353 --> 00:41:14,753
even though you'll definitely
pass the exam.

795
00:41:14,944 --> 00:41:17,360
Although it's easy, the ruler's
intention is hard to predict.

796
00:41:17,472 --> 00:41:18,512
Put this over there.

797
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,340
No matter how good my essays
and articles are,

798
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:23,344
garnering His Majesty's admiration
is still vital.

799
00:41:24,433 --> 00:41:26,472
Mr. Sun is His Majesty's teacher.

800
00:41:26,632 --> 00:41:28,953
I'm sure he knows how to please
His Majesty the best.

801
00:41:29,273 --> 00:41:31,592
Now, you're already
a grand provincial scholar.

802
00:41:31,592 --> 00:41:33,072
And, he also recommended you.

803
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:35,840
I assume you'll receive a high position
after joining the officialdom.

804
00:41:36,793 --> 00:41:37,512
That's not enough.

805
00:41:37,552 --> 00:41:39,069
Just proceed with caution, then.

806
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:40,496
Third Brother, with your aspirations,

807
00:41:40,576 --> 00:41:41,870
I'm sure you can rise to success

808
00:41:41,873 --> 00:41:43,273
and achieve your dream.

809
00:41:43,273 --> 00:41:44,072
Young Master,

810
00:41:44,152 --> 00:41:45,789
I'll pack this outfit on your behalf.

811
00:41:45,790 --> 00:41:46,832
- All right.
- Don't move!

812
00:41:47,233 --> 00:41:49,032
Isn't that the outfit I made for you?

813
00:41:49,386 --> 00:41:50,590
You didn't wear it, huh?

814
00:41:50,992 --> 00:41:52,233
Why didn't you wear it?

815
00:41:52,393 --> 00:41:53,552
You detest it, don't you?

816
00:41:53,856 --> 00:41:55,350
It's not that Young Master detests it.

817
00:41:55,353 --> 00:41:56,353
He can't bear to wear it.

818
00:41:56,393 --> 00:41:58,632
He wishes he could worship
this outfit if he could.

819
00:41:58,793 --> 00:42:00,873
Outfits are made to be worn.

820
00:42:00,913 --> 00:42:02,273
Wear it right now.

821
00:42:02,384 --> 00:42:03,910
I'll wear it during the imperial exam.

822
00:42:03,913 --> 00:42:05,273
No. You have to wear it now.

823
00:42:05,313 --> 00:42:06,112
Yining!

824
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:07,953
Sixth Uncle?

825
00:42:07,953 --> 00:42:09,072
I've finally found you!

826
00:42:09,112 --> 00:42:10,512
Go and check on Yixiu on my behalf!

827
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:11,472
She fell into the water!

828
00:42:15,753 --> 00:42:17,472
So, Young Master Han rescued you?

829
00:42:18,552 --> 00:42:20,353
Someone saw him
carrying you from the water

830
00:42:20,353 --> 00:42:21,472
to the shore.

831
00:42:22,233 --> 00:42:23,833
How could you be so careless?

832
00:42:24,353 --> 00:42:25,913
If news of this gets out,

833
00:42:26,353 --> 00:42:28,192
your reputation will be ruined.

834
00:42:28,433 --> 00:42:29,512
What if Young Master Han

835
00:42:29,873 --> 00:42:30,953
isn't willing to marry you?

836
00:42:31,793 --> 00:42:32,913
What will you do by then?

837
00:42:32,913 --> 00:42:34,393
I don't want to be married to Han Zhao.

838
00:42:34,393 --> 00:42:36,320
I don't want to marry into
the Princess's Residence.

839
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,070
Nonsense.

840
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:39,120
We can't afford to be the target
of a scandal like this.

841
00:42:39,313 --> 00:42:40,072
Don't worry.

842
00:42:40,393 --> 00:42:42,309
I'll discuss this with Her Highness.

843
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:45,088
They intended to establish a marital
alliance with us in the first place.

844
00:42:45,168 --> 00:42:47,040
Now that this had happened,

845
00:42:47,512 --> 00:42:49,192
I assume they'll be reasonable about it.

846
00:42:49,913 --> 00:42:52,793
I told you already!
I'm not getting married to him!

847
00:42:53,592 --> 00:42:54,592
Enough already.

848
00:42:55,597 --> 00:42:57,112
Yixiu is in a state of shock.

849
00:42:57,112 --> 00:42:58,313
You should stop forcing her.

850
00:42:58,753 --> 00:43:00,512
I'm doing this for her own good.

851
00:43:01,192 --> 00:43:02,913
Xiu's future will be ruined

852
00:43:03,273 --> 00:43:05,353
if we don't resolve this soon.

853
00:43:06,072 --> 00:43:08,072
There are other solutions to this.

854
00:43:08,953 --> 00:43:10,072
Let's give it some thought.

855
00:43:10,144 --> 00:43:12,656
We shouldn't rush to discuss
the marriage proposal with Her Highness.

856
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:14,559
I'm afraid

857
00:43:14,992 --> 00:43:16,829
there's no other solution to this.

858
00:43:16,830 --> 00:43:19,008
Establishing a marital alliance
is the best solution.

859
00:43:19,192 --> 00:43:19,992
First Master,

860
00:43:20,176 --> 00:43:22,128
you spend most of your time
away from home.

861
00:43:22,233 --> 00:43:24,512
I've been managing the family
all this while.

862
00:43:24,752 --> 00:43:25,630
Regarding this matter,

863
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:27,800
it's better for you to heed my will.

864
00:43:28,072 --> 00:43:28,472
