=The Rise of Ning=

2
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,320
(Adapted from Wen Tan's novel "Chancellor
Training Handbook" from Jinjiang Literature)

3
00:01:36,636 --> 00:01:38,448
=Episode 12=

4
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,360
Seventh Lady, isn't it a bit wasteful

5
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,379
to use the Mongolian milkvetch
and peony tonic

6
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,230
as fertiliser for the hardy begonia?

7
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,640
From now on,
when Mother sends over the tonic,

8
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,218
use it to water the hardy begonia

9
00:01:57,219 --> 00:01:59,070
every now and then.

10
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,310
Yes.

11
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,749
Do you suspect something again?

12
00:02:04,299 --> 00:02:05,498
I suspect there is something more

13
00:02:05,499 --> 00:02:08,029
to my mother's death.

14
00:02:10,299 --> 00:02:13,069
The truth will come clear in a few days.

15
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,509
Seventh Lady.

16
00:02:15,535 --> 00:02:18,293
Seventh Lady, Madam Lin has requested
your presence at Chengjing Hall.

17
00:02:18,294 --> 00:02:20,094
An official has come and is reporting

18
00:02:20,095 --> 00:02:23,705
the details of Fifth Master Qiao
and Chen Si's case to Second Master.

19
00:02:24,801 --> 00:02:27,534
Registrar Luo, the trial for Chen Si's case
has reached a conclusion.

20
00:02:27,535 --> 00:02:28,784
I've come to inform you.

21
00:02:29,095 --> 00:02:30,173
Has he confessed?

22
00:02:30,174 --> 00:02:32,790
He has admitted to ordering his men to ambush
Seventh Lady at Yuanjing Pavilion

23
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,500
disguised as bandits,
luring us into the residence,

24
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,120
and bribing Lian Qing
to frame Seventh Lady.

25
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,064
He confessed to it all.

26
00:02:37,095 --> 00:02:39,094
However, he insists that he acted alone,

27
00:02:39,095 --> 00:02:40,254
without anyone else behind him.

28
00:02:40,255 --> 00:02:42,425
He has been sentenced
to eight years in prison.

29
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,070
All right.

30
00:02:45,614 --> 00:02:48,694
Thank you for your efforts.

31
00:02:48,695 --> 00:02:49,773
It's my duty.

32
00:02:49,774 --> 00:02:51,425
I'll take my leave now.

33
00:02:51,774 --> 00:02:52,613
Butler Bai.

34
00:02:52,614 --> 00:02:53,534
Yes.

35
00:02:53,535 --> 00:02:55,360
Escort the guest out.

36
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,893
- Prepare a small gift as well.
- Yes.

37
00:02:56,894 --> 00:02:58,265
Thank you, Registrar Luo.

38
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,511
Thank you, Madam.

39
00:03:05,734 --> 00:03:06,664
Chengzhang,

40
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,659
why did everything suddenly become

41
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,911
Chen Si's doing alone?

42
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,134
This is what First Master Qiao and I

43
00:03:14,135 --> 00:03:15,573
agreed upon.

44
00:03:15,574 --> 00:03:16,893
Both the Luo and Qiao families

45
00:03:16,894 --> 00:03:18,733
are influential.

46
00:03:18,734 --> 00:03:20,414
If word of this gets out,

47
00:03:20,415 --> 00:03:22,104
it would be a disgrace for both of us.

48
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:25,299
So, we are just letting

49
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,269
the Qiao siblings off the hook.

50
00:03:38,975 --> 00:03:42,705
You misunderstand.

51
00:03:43,454 --> 00:03:45,059
How could this be letting them off?

52
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:47,020
You've seen Qiao Yuechan punished

53
00:03:47,021 --> 00:03:48,550
at the Ancestral Shrine.

54
00:03:48,551 --> 00:03:50,871
I've already sent her
to the countryside residence.

55
00:03:50,872 --> 00:03:53,442
Her brother has been expelled
from the Qiao family,

56
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:56,271
and all their shops and lands

57
00:03:56,272 --> 00:03:57,687
have been reclaimed.

58
00:03:57,688 --> 00:03:59,379
This is their punishment.

59
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:01,523
But Father, do you remember

60
00:04:03,193 --> 00:04:04,632
you promised to give me

61
00:04:04,633 --> 00:04:06,563
a proper explanation
for my mother's death?

62
00:04:10,272 --> 00:04:11,602
Of course, I do.

63
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,192
Chen Si has been punished,

64
00:04:13,193 --> 00:04:15,722
and the Qiao siblings have been
expelled from the residence.

65
00:04:15,857 --> 00:04:17,347
That is the explanation.

66
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:20,752
So you want this matter

67
00:04:20,753 --> 00:04:23,562
to be swept under the rug.

68
00:04:24,683 --> 00:04:26,560
How is it unclear?

69
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,952
The law has been enforced,
and the family rules have been upheld.

70
00:04:28,953 --> 00:04:31,899
Do you two really want
to drive Qiao Yuechan to her death?

71
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,430
We "want"? What does that mean?

72
00:04:40,275 --> 00:04:42,285
Qiao Yuechan's crimes

73
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,030
are indeed unforgivable,

74
00:04:45,116 --> 00:04:47,475
but she has served this household

75
00:04:47,476 --> 00:04:48,475
for over 20 years.

76
00:04:48,476 --> 00:04:51,000
Just because she acted heartlessly
doesn't mean we should be ruthless.

77
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,160
This is a family scandal.

78
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,435
Airing it out would bring shame

79
00:04:54,436 --> 00:04:56,446
to the Luo family.

80
00:05:00,876 --> 00:05:02,006
Yining,

81
00:05:04,315 --> 00:05:06,566
if your mother were still alive,

82
00:05:07,234 --> 00:05:09,154
she would agree with this.

83
00:05:09,155 --> 00:05:12,154
For the Luo family,

84
00:05:12,155 --> 00:05:13,965
reputation and honour come first.

85
00:05:16,796 --> 00:05:18,645
So, to you,

86
00:05:18,796 --> 00:05:22,115
family bonds and love don't compare

87
00:05:22,116 --> 00:05:24,126
to something as shallow as reputation.

88
00:05:30,635 --> 00:05:31,965
You…

89
00:05:42,065 --> 00:05:43,955
You simply don't understand

90
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,710
the burdens a head of the Luo family

91
00:05:47,337 --> 00:05:49,347
must bear.

92
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,390
So be it.

93
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:56,085
So be it.

94
00:06:08,715 --> 00:06:09,845
Qing Qu.

95
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,551
Find a suitable residence for me.

96
00:06:13,147 --> 00:06:15,516
It doesn't have to be big, just livable.

97
00:06:15,676 --> 00:06:18,566
I plan to leave Luo's Residence soon.

98
00:06:19,778 --> 00:06:20,899
Leave Luo's Residence?

99
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,390
What about Old Madam?

100
00:06:22,755 --> 00:06:24,525
I am her granddaughter.

101
00:06:24,602 --> 00:06:26,571
I'll take care of her and make sure

102
00:06:26,876 --> 00:06:28,525
she lives comfortably in her old age.

103
00:06:30,275 --> 00:06:31,766
But within a year,

104
00:06:32,075 --> 00:06:33,555
I will uncover the truth

105
00:06:33,556 --> 00:06:35,285
of my mother's death,

106
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:36,839
and then I'll leave.

107
00:06:42,395 --> 00:06:44,698
Young Master,
did Senior Daoyan send word

108
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:45,499
because we're close

109
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,109
to restoring Official Chen's name?

110
00:06:48,275 --> 00:06:50,126
I understand his concerns.

111
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,070
We only have half of the ledger.

112
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,880
Even if we have the full records
and the testimony,

113
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,030
it's still unlikely
we'll be able to overturn the case.

114
00:06:58,098 --> 00:07:01,059
The mastermind must be
someone of great power and influence.

115
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,471
Besides evidence,

116
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:05,108
we'll need support
from influential people.

117
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,519
What's the progress
on the other half of the ledger?

118
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,770
We've discovered that Song Yingshan
has a surviving granddaughter,

119
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:11,160
but her whereabouts are still unknown.

120
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,773
Our men are still searching.

121
00:07:13,219 --> 00:07:15,979
Meanwhile, Senior Daoyan remains

122
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,379
on the government's wanted list,

123
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,070
so we can't act rashly.

124
00:07:24,939 --> 00:07:26,069
Right.

125
00:07:26,164 --> 00:07:28,294
How's the academy's progress?

126
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:30,140
It'll be ready in a couple of days.

127
00:07:30,141 --> 00:07:33,108
Have Qi send this letter
to Senior Daoyan

128
00:07:33,218 --> 00:07:34,628
along with a message.

129
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,829
Tell him

130
00:07:37,484 --> 00:07:40,320
that even if we can't overturn the case
before the trial period ends,

131
00:07:40,898 --> 00:07:42,709
we have other ways.

132
00:07:43,387 --> 00:07:44,557
And tell him

133
00:07:44,612 --> 00:07:47,661
not to risk his life.

134
00:07:47,778 --> 00:07:48,909
Understood.

135
00:07:49,338 --> 00:07:50,457
Although, Young Master,

136
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:52,138
you've been showing increasing concern

137
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,748
over Seventh Lady's matters.

138
00:07:54,004 --> 00:07:56,373
Don't you think it might be a little…

139
00:07:57,218 --> 00:07:59,428
A little what? Out with it.

140
00:07:59,458 --> 00:08:01,857
I'm doing this not only for Seventh Lady

141
00:08:01,858 --> 00:08:03,258
but also out of gratitude

142
00:08:03,259 --> 00:08:04,949
to Madam Gu for raising me.

143
00:08:06,939 --> 00:08:07,938
All right.

144
00:08:07,939 --> 00:08:10,269
Whatever you say.

145
00:08:17,535 --> 00:08:19,216
(Marquis Anbei's Residence)

146
00:08:22,059 --> 00:08:23,977
You said you couldn't find out

147
00:08:23,978 --> 00:08:25,628
their whereabouts that day?

148
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:27,949
Uncle.

149
00:08:29,139 --> 00:08:31,308
Yuanjing Pavilion was chaotic that day.

150
00:08:31,451 --> 00:08:33,622
No one saw those two.

151
00:08:33,866 --> 00:08:36,218
I sent people to investigate secretly
at Luo's Residence.

152
00:08:36,219 --> 00:08:38,730
Although Seventh Lady was chased,

153
00:08:38,731 --> 00:08:40,001
both she and Third Young Master

154
00:08:40,002 --> 00:08:41,972
returned home that night as usual.

155
00:08:42,418 --> 00:08:43,549
Uncle,

156
00:08:44,259 --> 00:08:46,189
shall I go and ask around myself?

157
00:08:47,139 --> 00:08:48,268
No need.

158
00:08:50,003 --> 00:08:51,453
It's likely Luo's Residence

159
00:08:52,467 --> 00:08:54,518
is just covering up
their family scandal.

160
00:08:54,850 --> 00:08:56,541
Keep an eye on them.

161
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:58,490
If those two

162
00:08:58,491 --> 00:09:00,577
leave the residence,

163
00:09:00,578 --> 00:09:01,868
report immediately.

164
00:09:02,418 --> 00:09:03,589
Understood.

165
00:09:23,538 --> 00:09:26,745
Seventh Lady, look.
The hardy begonia is blooming.

166
00:09:26,746 --> 00:09:27,876
Yes.

167
00:09:28,077 --> 00:09:30,578
Looks like the Mongolian milkvetch
and peony tonic

168
00:09:30,579 --> 00:09:32,350
isn't harmful to plants after all.

169
00:09:32,475 --> 00:09:33,835
But then what about the hardy begonia

170
00:09:33,836 --> 00:09:35,966
that Mother watered

171
00:09:36,339 --> 00:09:37,949
with the medicine?

172
00:09:38,099 --> 00:09:40,465
Medically speaking,
the flowers must have been poisoned.

173
00:09:40,466 --> 00:09:41,667
Someone likely tampered

174
00:09:41,668 --> 00:09:43,518
with Madam Gu's medicine.

175
00:09:44,587 --> 00:09:46,957
Seventh Lady,
Third Young Master is here.

176
00:09:48,099 --> 00:09:49,228
Shenyuan.

177
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:50,956
What brings you here?

178
00:09:51,938 --> 00:09:54,108
Do you have time?
I'd like to take you somewhere.

179
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,937
Qing Qu, come with me.

180
00:09:55,938 --> 00:09:57,458
If Grandmother or Mother ask,

181
00:09:57,459 --> 00:09:59,709
say I've gone to Baiyun Temple to pray.

182
00:09:59,818 --> 00:10:01,388
- Yes.
- Smart.

183
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,870
Of course.

184
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,950
Young Master, we're here.

185
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,869
Why doesn't this carriage
have a step stool?

186
00:10:38,099 --> 00:10:39,078
Forgive us, Seventh Lady.

187
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:41,037
Young Master usually jumps down

188
00:10:41,038 --> 00:10:42,200
since he has long legs,

189
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,238
so we didn't prepare a stool.

190
00:10:43,239 --> 00:10:44,557
What's that supposed to mean?

191
00:10:44,558 --> 00:10:46,198
Are you saying our lady has short legs?

192
00:10:46,199 --> 00:10:48,037
Seventh Lady, I didn't mean that at all!

193
00:10:48,038 --> 00:10:48,998
Don't you…

194
00:10:48,999 --> 00:10:50,488
What do you mean, "you"?

195
00:10:52,558 --> 00:10:53,917
Sounds like exactly what you meant.

196
00:10:53,918 --> 00:10:55,118
Stop trying to deny it.

197
00:10:55,119 --> 00:10:56,637
Seventh Lady,
I swear, I didn't mean that.

198
00:10:56,638 --> 00:10:58,358
- I meant…
- Enough.

199
00:10:58,359 --> 00:10:59,517
Shenyuan,

200
00:10:59,518 --> 00:11:01,238
where are we?

201
00:11:01,239 --> 00:11:02,368
Come here.

202
00:11:06,638 --> 00:11:09,088
What is this place?

203
00:11:10,797 --> 00:11:11,926
Together.

204
00:11:12,057 --> 00:11:13,088
Hold this side.

205
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:22,730

206
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,819

♪Family is the safe haven

208
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,390
This is an orphanage.

209
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,437
Lately, they've been struggling,

210
00:11:40,438 --> 00:11:42,277
so I donated some money

211
00:11:42,278 --> 00:11:43,478
under Madam Gu's name.

212
00:11:43,479 --> 00:11:44,689
They were grateful

213
00:11:44,719 --> 00:11:47,368
and renamed the place Minglan Hall.

214
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,749
Now, Madam Gu's kindness

215
00:11:50,325 --> 00:11:52,055
can continue.

216
00:11:53,319 --> 00:11:54,689
Thank you.

217
00:11:54,879 --> 00:11:56,598
Can I continue

218
00:11:56,599 --> 00:11:57,998
to support this place?

219
00:11:57,999 --> 00:11:59,088
Of course.

220
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:02,929
Mother would be glad.

00:12:20,777 --> 00:12:21,579
Bring it here.

227
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,790
Here it comes!

228
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,165
So, you suspect

229
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:31,198
that the Mongolian milkvetch
and peony tonic

230
00:12:31,199 --> 00:12:32,689
your mother drank was poisoned,

231
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,437
and she didn't die
from childbirth complications?

232
00:12:35,438 --> 00:12:38,049
Otherwise, how do you explain

233
00:12:38,158 --> 00:12:39,529
the death of the hardy begonia?

234
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:43,008
I remember that hardy begonia.

235
00:12:43,518 --> 00:12:45,728
Your mother cared for it
for over a decade.

236
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:47,809
It wouldn't have just died like that.

237
00:12:50,901 --> 00:12:52,790
I've been too hasty.

238
00:12:53,479 --> 00:12:56,368
Now that Mistress Qiao has been sent
to the countryside,

239
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,919
it's difficult to investigate further.

240
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,238
All those who served your mother

241
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:03,958
were dismissed

242
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:05,888
after her death.

243
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,517
Even Physician Qi, who treated her,

244
00:13:08,518 --> 00:13:09,848
has passed away.

245
00:13:10,479 --> 00:13:12,289
How did you know about this?

246
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:17,728
Did you secretly investigate
because you also found her death suspicious?

247
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,878
I do find Mistress Qiao untrustworthy,

248
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:23,437
so I looked into it.

249
00:13:23,438 --> 00:13:26,088
I found out
that Physician Qi had a disciple

250
00:13:26,293 --> 00:13:28,542
who also treated your mother.

251
00:13:28,877 --> 00:13:30,328
I'll find him.

252
00:13:31,911 --> 00:13:33,281
Thank you.

253
00:13:39,286 --> 00:13:40,341
Go sit down.

254
00:13:40,342 --> 00:13:41,471
Thank you, Young Master.

255
00:13:43,168 --> 00:13:44,258
Enjoy your meal.

256
00:13:52,487 --> 00:13:53,726
I see now

257
00:13:53,727 --> 00:13:56,206
why you always take this road.

258
00:13:56,207 --> 00:13:58,287
You must come here often.

259
00:13:58,288 --> 00:13:59,527
We haven't even ordered,

260
00:13:59,528 --> 00:14:01,218
yet she brought the wontons right over.

261
00:14:07,248 --> 00:14:08,686
Are you here

262
00:14:08,687 --> 00:14:10,368
for the wontons

263
00:14:10,369 --> 00:14:12,898
or for her?

264
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,339
Is that something a young lady

265
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,767
should be asking?

266
00:14:19,768 --> 00:14:21,086
Fine. I won't ask.

267
00:14:21,087 --> 00:14:22,858
A gentleman reasons with words,
not fists.

268
00:14:23,607 --> 00:14:25,777
Of course, I'm here for the wontons.

269
00:14:31,727 --> 00:14:34,326
But I do admire

270
00:14:34,327 --> 00:14:35,937
her self-reliance.

271
00:14:36,008 --> 00:14:37,738
She doesn't need to depend on anyone.

272
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:44,218
You haven't seen the struggles

273
00:14:44,248 --> 00:14:47,498
she goes through
just to earn a little money.

274
00:14:47,607 --> 00:14:50,378
That may be true, but it's still better
than relying on others.

275
00:14:51,327 --> 00:14:53,008
Indeed. The world is too harsh

276
00:14:53,009 --> 00:14:54,659
on women.

277
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,407
They're restricted
to live their whole lives

278
00:14:56,408 --> 00:14:58,047
only within the walls
of the inner chambers.

279
00:14:58,048 --> 00:14:59,578
No matter how much they struggle,

280
00:14:59,768 --> 00:15:01,858
they can never escape that narrow world.

281
00:15:05,207 --> 00:15:06,927
That's why I have to leave

282
00:15:06,928 --> 00:15:08,458
this tiny residence.

283
00:15:08,888 --> 00:15:11,578
All I seek is what brings me joy.

284
00:15:14,087 --> 00:15:15,206
If that's what you want,

285
00:15:15,207 --> 00:15:16,738
I'll support you.

286
00:15:17,888 --> 00:15:20,137
But this path won't be an easy one.

287
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:23,047
Achieving one's wish

288
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:24,206
is never easy.

289
00:15:24,207 --> 00:15:26,686
It definitely won't be
as simple as just reaching for it.

290
00:15:26,687 --> 00:15:28,247
I've already asked Qing Qu

291
00:15:28,248 --> 00:15:30,858
to help me find a suitable residence.

292
00:15:31,408 --> 00:15:32,767
One day,

293
00:15:32,768 --> 00:15:34,458
I'll leave the Luo Residence.

294
00:15:34,528 --> 00:15:35,657
And then?

295
00:15:35,928 --> 00:15:38,167
I can do paper cutting.
I can also paint,

296
00:15:38,168 --> 00:15:39,767
and I've learned bookkeeping

297
00:15:39,768 --> 00:15:41,206
from my mother.

298
00:15:41,207 --> 00:15:42,367
I can support myself.

299
00:15:42,368 --> 00:15:43,566
I have some skills.

300
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:45,537
I won't let myself starve.

301
00:15:47,567 --> 00:15:50,247
What about you?

302
00:15:50,248 --> 00:15:52,287
Are you planning

303
00:15:52,288 --> 00:15:53,726
to hide in the Luo Residence forever

304
00:15:53,727 --> 00:15:55,326
just to achieve your goals?

305
00:15:55,327 --> 00:15:56,897
Of course not.

306
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,430
Within books,
there's wealth beyond measure.

307
00:16:02,777 --> 00:16:05,306
Within books, there's a house of gold.

308
00:16:06,128 --> 00:16:08,606
If a man wants to fulfill his ambitions,

309
00:16:08,607 --> 00:16:11,057
he should diligently study
the Six Classics by the window.

310
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,160
The triennial provincial exam
is approaching.

311
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,813
Are you planning
to take the imperial exam?

312
00:16:15,814 --> 00:16:17,544
I have considered it.

313
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,186
But…

314
00:16:21,288 --> 00:16:24,218
You're thinking that since I'm not
officially listed in the family register,

315
00:16:24,327 --> 00:16:27,218
what identity would I use
to sit for the exam, right?

316
00:16:28,408 --> 00:16:30,177
I'll just use another identity.

317
00:16:30,528 --> 00:16:32,177
I'll find a way somehow.

318
00:16:36,687 --> 00:16:37,817
Shenyuan.

319
00:16:39,408 --> 00:16:41,057
I'll help you
get into the family register.

320
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,686
Seventh Lady, can you really do that?

321
00:16:47,687 --> 00:16:49,897
Then Young Master won't be
an unregistered son anymore.

322
00:16:50,048 --> 00:16:51,417
Go back and eat your food.

323
00:16:52,727 --> 00:16:54,927
Once you're in the family register,

324
00:16:54,928 --> 00:16:56,806
you can study and take
the imperial exam openly,

325
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:59,417
just like other sons
from proper backgrounds.

326
00:16:59,567 --> 00:17:01,927
If you become an official,

327
00:17:01,928 --> 00:17:04,686
even though the Luo Residence
isn't that prestigious,

328
00:17:04,687 --> 00:17:06,407
the Luo family could still provide

329
00:17:06,408 --> 00:17:07,766
some support for your career.

330
00:17:07,767 --> 00:17:10,006
Both Grandmother and Mother

Sixth Uncle and Sixth Sister

333
00:17:14,368 --> 00:17:15,978
treat you well too.

334
00:17:16,247 --> 00:17:17,898
Why not make the change

335
00:17:18,007 --> 00:17:20,658
and accept it?

Back when I was in the side yard,

344
00:17:41,328 --> 00:17:42,887
I didn't have so many eyes on me.

345
00:17:42,888 --> 00:17:45,418
I could sneak out
to have some fun sometimes.

346
00:17:46,168 --> 00:17:47,766
I knew you liked this place,

347
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:49,498
so I brought you here.

Sir.

353
00:18:22,047 --> 00:18:24,658
You have so many different patterns.

354
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:26,480
Did you cut all these yourself?

355
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:29,567
Yes. You seem to know
a thing or two about paper cutting.

356
00:18:29,568 --> 00:18:31,486
I've learned paper cutting
since I was young.

357
00:18:31,487 --> 00:18:32,726
I know few techniques.

358
00:18:32,727 --> 00:18:34,898
Your craftsmanship is exquisite.

359
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:37,777

I've mentioned to you before

367
00:19:09,888 --> 00:19:11,658
that he likes paper cutting too.

368
00:19:12,128 --> 00:19:13,246
I didn't expect we'd meet again

369
00:19:13,247 --> 00:19:14,857
at a stall selling paper cuttings.

370
00:19:22,287 --> 00:19:23,567
Pleased to meet you, Seventh Lady.

371
00:19:23,568 --> 00:19:25,537
I am Lu Jiaxue.

372
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:29,750
Why are you here by yourself?

373
00:19:30,207 --> 00:19:32,057
Did you get separated from your family?

374
00:19:32,328 --> 00:19:33,807
Do you need us to escort you back?

375
00:19:33,808 --> 00:19:35,407
(He had eye issues)

376
00:19:35,408 --> 00:19:37,057
(and couldn't see my face.)

377
00:19:37,247 --> 00:19:38,567
(If I speak,)

378
00:19:38,568 --> 00:19:40,577
(will he recognise my voice?)

379
00:19:43,287 --> 00:19:45,898
Why aren't you speaking?

380
00:19:51,808 --> 00:19:53,218
I've been looking everywhere for you.

381
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:56,658
- How did you end up here?
- Third Young Master.

382
00:20:00,727 --> 00:20:01,898
Mr. Cheng.

383
00:20:04,767 --> 00:20:05,726
Uncle,

384
00:20:05,727 --> 00:20:07,567
this is the Third Young Master
of the Luo Residence,

385
00:20:07,568 --> 00:20:08,738
Luo Shenyuan.

386
00:20:10,128 --> 00:20:12,057
It's an honour, Marquis Lu.

387
00:20:12,247 --> 00:20:13,377
Mr. Cheng.

388
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:15,087
I didn't expect Mr. Cheng

389
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:16,766
would remember me
after only a brief encounter

390
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,927
at the Luo Residence.

391
00:20:17,928 --> 00:20:20,567
Though we haven't officially
met before this,

392
00:20:20,568 --> 00:20:21,887
Shanyuan

393
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:24,057
has told me about you.

394
00:20:24,088 --> 00:20:26,127
We happened to run

395
00:20:26,128 --> 00:20:27,658
into Seventh Lady here.

396
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,927
But for some reason,

397
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:32,258
she suddenly lost her voice.

398
00:20:36,207 --> 00:20:38,898
My sister recently had a severe illness,

399
00:20:38,951 --> 00:20:40,671
and her vocal cords were damaged.

400
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:41,726
She hasn't recovered yet.

401
00:20:41,727 --> 00:20:43,567
Please kindly overlook

402
00:20:43,568 --> 00:20:45,526
any offenses.

403
00:20:45,527 --> 00:20:46,978
Health is most important.

404
00:20:47,047 --> 00:20:49,046
Seventh Lady,
please go back and rest well.

405
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:52,898
I wish you a speedy recovery.
I look forward to meeting you again.

406
00:20:58,608 --> 00:20:59,738
Goodbye.

407
00:21:27,767 --> 00:21:29,498
They didn't do anything to you,
did they?

408
00:21:38,888 --> 00:21:40,057
Shenyuan!

409
00:21:42,047 --> 00:21:43,218
Who are you?

410
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:45,178
Why are you trying to kill us?

411
00:21:51,287 --> 00:21:52,418
Shenyuan!

412
00:22:06,007 --> 00:22:07,097
Run!

413
00:22:28,408 --> 00:22:30,246
Young Master! Seventh Lady!

414
00:22:30,247 --> 00:22:31,178
Young Master!

415
00:22:32,168 --> 00:22:32,927
Young Master!

416
00:22:32,928 --> 00:22:34,087
We finally found you.

417
00:22:34,088 --> 00:22:35,880
- Come on.
- Seventh Lady, are you all right?

418
00:22:36,007 --> 00:22:36,857
Let's go.

419
00:22:45,648 --> 00:22:46,577
Marquis.

420
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,429
She wasn't hurt, was she?

421
00:22:48,527 --> 00:22:49,407
No, Your Lordship.

422
00:22:49,408 --> 00:22:51,046
I avoided her as best I could.

423
00:22:51,047 --> 00:22:52,206
She wasn't harmed.

424
00:22:52,207 --> 00:22:53,658
Third Young Master Luo doesn't appear

425
00:22:53,888 --> 00:22:55,458
to know martial arts.

426
00:22:55,608 --> 00:22:58,006
Moreover, he did not react

427
00:22:58,007 --> 00:22:59,219
when I attacked his back.

428
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,351
Are you certain?

429
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,631
Yes.

430
00:23:07,808 --> 00:23:08,938
Uncle,

431
00:23:09,247 --> 00:23:11,938
do you suspect he was pretending?

432
00:23:12,088 --> 00:23:13,698
I lost my patience

433
00:23:13,928 --> 00:23:15,607
and went to test that girl first.

434
00:23:15,608 --> 00:23:17,738
I might have alerted them.

435
00:23:17,848 --> 00:23:18,978
No matter.

436
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:21,431
A fox will always reveal its tail.

437
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:22,898
Keep watching

438
00:23:23,007 --> 00:23:24,498
that Seventh Lady.

439
00:23:24,767 --> 00:23:26,498
Yes, Uncle.

440
00:23:30,607 --> 00:23:33,139
(Jimo House)

441
00:23:37,487 --> 00:23:38,607
Young Master,

442
00:23:38,608 --> 00:23:40,137
the man who ambushed you today.

443
00:23:40,138 --> 00:23:41,789
Was he one of Lu Jiaxue's men?

444
00:23:45,247 --> 00:23:47,337
He kept aiming at my back.

445
00:23:47,608 --> 00:23:49,178
It was definitely him.

446
00:23:50,207 --> 00:23:52,537
I must have been followed
as soon as we left.

447
00:23:52,687 --> 00:23:54,418
We'll have to be even more careful.

448
00:23:58,247 --> 00:23:59,377
Seventh Lady.

449
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:09,459
Mei, when my eyes are healed,

450
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:12,311
I want you to be the first person I see.

451
00:24:16,213 --> 00:24:17,726
Lu Jiaxue sent me

452
00:24:17,727 --> 00:24:19,057
to get rid of you.

453
00:24:23,687 --> 00:24:24,817
Seventh Lady,

454
00:24:25,207 --> 00:24:27,017
drink this mind-calming tonic.

455
00:24:29,967 --> 00:24:31,647
You've looked unwell

456
00:24:31,648 --> 00:24:33,567
since you returned from the market.

457
00:24:33,568 --> 00:24:34,966
Did something happen

458
00:24:34,967 --> 00:24:36,458
while you got separated?

459
00:24:44,603 --> 00:24:45,774
Nothing.

460
00:24:46,168 --> 00:24:47,726
I'm just tired

461
00:24:47,727 --> 00:24:49,097
from all the walking.

462
00:24:49,648 --> 00:24:51,178
You've had a long day too.

463
00:24:51,648 --> 00:24:53,458
Go and rest.

464
00:24:57,328 --> 00:24:58,498
Anything else?

465
00:24:58,957 --> 00:25:00,327
Why are you so determined

466
00:25:00,328 --> 00:25:02,817
to help the Third Young Master
get into the family register?

467
00:25:03,088 --> 00:25:05,057
Second Master surely won't agree.

468
00:25:07,116 --> 00:25:08,727
I'm not just helping him,

469
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,138
I'm helping

470
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:12,071
the Luo Residence as well.

471
00:25:12,598 --> 00:25:14,168
He's talented.

472
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:17,430
If he ever becomes an official,

473
00:25:17,487 --> 00:25:19,337
his future will be bright.

474
00:25:20,901 --> 00:25:23,150
If he could take charge
of the Luo family,

475
00:25:23,967 --> 00:25:26,486
it would be good for the Luo Residence,

476
00:25:26,487 --> 00:25:29,617
for Grandmother, and for Mother.

477
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:32,857
So, how do you plan to help him?

478
00:25:33,487 --> 00:25:35,887
Although Old Madam's attitude
toward the Third Young Master

479
00:25:35,888 --> 00:25:37,738
has improved a bit,

480
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,870
it's still indifferent.

481
00:25:41,592 --> 00:25:45,521
Drop by drop, water wears through stone.

482
00:25:47,727 --> 00:25:51,138
I believe Grandmother

483
00:25:51,207 --> 00:25:52,857
will accept him one day.

484
00:25:54,362 --> 00:25:56,761
(Danhua Abode)

485
00:25:59,168 --> 00:25:59,857
Go ahead.

486
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:19,259
Well?

487
00:26:20,168 --> 00:26:21,418
Speak up!

488
00:26:23,527 --> 00:26:24,647
Madam Chen.

489
00:26:24,648 --> 00:26:27,658
Sixth Lady's waist
has grown three inches

490
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:34,119
since last time.

491
00:26:36,368 --> 00:26:38,138
How did you gain so much weight?

492
00:26:38,168 --> 00:26:40,407
You must have been
eating behind our backs.

493
00:26:40,408 --> 00:26:42,138
I have not.

494
00:26:46,168 --> 00:26:48,138
Lian Hong, kneel.

495
00:26:49,808 --> 00:26:52,898
You're punished
with 20 strikes on the hand.

496
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:56,046
Mother, maybe it's because

497
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:57,440
I drank too much water last night.

498
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,057
Please let me off this one time.

499
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,486
Mother, if anyone is to blame, it's me.

500
00:27:04,487 --> 00:27:06,046
Why punish Lian Hong?

501
00:27:06,047 --> 00:27:07,807
She's your personal maid.

502
00:27:07,808 --> 00:27:10,087
She did not stop her mistress.

503
00:27:10,088 --> 00:27:11,297
Therefore, she must be punished.

504
00:27:12,447 --> 00:27:13,297
Enough!

505
00:27:13,888 --> 00:27:15,138
- Sixth Lady.
- Sixth Lady.

506
00:27:15,447 --> 00:27:16,577
Sixth Lady.

507
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:18,607
- Sixth Lady.
- Mother, I know I was wrong.

508
00:27:18,608 --> 00:27:20,206
Please don't hit her.

509
00:27:20,207 --> 00:27:21,647
Please forgive me this time.

510
00:27:21,648 --> 00:27:23,458
I won't eat behind your back again.

511
00:27:24,798 --> 00:27:27,128
Pass my order. From today on,

512
00:27:27,247 --> 00:27:28,647
Sixth Lady's diet

513
00:27:28,648 --> 00:27:30,927
is limited to vegetables.
Everything else is banned,

514
00:27:30,928 --> 00:27:32,344
- including fruit.
- Yes.

515
00:27:32,345 --> 00:27:35,127
Mother, are you trying
to turn me into a nun?

516
00:27:35,128 --> 00:27:37,726
Even nuns get to eat two buns per meal!

517
00:27:37,727 --> 00:27:39,537
If you try to bargain again,

518
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,939
I'll stop the vegetables too.

519
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:43,990
No! I still want the vegetables.

520
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,766
Didn't Lin Mao say his medicine

521
00:27:47,767 --> 00:27:49,258
would stop me from gaining weight?

522
00:27:49,608 --> 00:27:50,777
He lied to me.

523
00:27:51,608 --> 00:27:53,577
Sixth Lady, where are you going?

524
00:27:58,328 --> 00:28:00,327
Lin Mao! You're a quack of physician!

525
00:28:00,328 --> 00:28:01,537
You liar!

526
00:28:01,648 --> 00:28:02,607
What's going on?

527
00:28:02,608 --> 00:28:04,658
What's going on? I'm getting fatter!

528
00:28:06,207 --> 00:28:07,337
No, you're not.

529
00:28:07,447 --> 00:28:09,246
- I think you've slimmed down.
- Stop lying.

530
00:28:09,247 --> 00:28:10,446
Ever since I took your medicine,

531
00:28:10,447 --> 00:28:12,087
I've been craving food every day.

532
00:28:12,088 --> 00:28:13,286
My waist is three inches bigger.

533
00:28:13,287 --> 00:28:15,320
And you still have the nerve
to say I've slimmed down?

534
00:28:16,928 --> 00:28:18,087
Calm down.

535
00:28:18,088 --> 00:28:21,446
This prescription is something I'm trying
for the first time, so I need more feedback.

536
00:28:21,447 --> 00:28:23,087
I'll adjust it right now.

537
00:28:23,088 --> 00:28:25,097
You're using me as a test subject,
aren't you?

538
00:28:25,128 --> 00:28:26,258
No!

539
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,807
I swear

540
00:28:27,808 --> 00:28:29,206
I'll see this through to the end.

541
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:31,800
I'll make sure your waist is slimmed.
I'll take full responsibility!

542
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,418
Bah!

543
00:28:35,438 --> 00:28:36,246
What are you doing?

544
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:38,120
Heaven has a road,
but you refuse to take it.

545
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:40,017
Instead, you walk straight into trouble.

546
00:28:40,408 --> 00:28:41,617
Don't touch my Fugui!

547
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,446
This goose is so fat.

548
00:28:44,447 --> 00:28:45,966
I'm going to eat it.

549
00:28:45,967 --> 00:28:47,159
Give it back!

550
00:28:47,207 --> 00:28:48,057
Let go!

551
00:28:48,967 --> 00:28:49,607
You…

552
00:28:49,608 --> 00:28:51,200
Don't hold a grudge against Fugui.

553
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,480
If you eat it, your mother
will never let you hear the end of it.

554
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,927
It's fine. I'll eat it first

555
00:28:54,928 --> 00:28:56,418
and then apologise to her.

556
00:28:57,064 --> 00:28:58,353
Don't touch Fugui!

557
00:29:00,727 --> 00:29:01,498
Yixiu!

558
00:29:06,013 --> 00:29:07,303
Bear with it.

559
00:29:07,848 --> 00:29:10,807
Will my hand rot
after applying this medicine?

560
00:29:10,808 --> 00:29:13,246
You can say I'm uneducated and ignorant,

561
00:29:13,247 --> 00:29:15,087
but don't doubt my healing salve.

562
00:29:15,088 --> 00:29:16,258
If you don't believe me, go ask…

563
00:29:18,128 --> 00:29:18,966
Forget it.

564
00:29:18,967 --> 00:29:20,218
Believe what you will.

565
00:29:20,767 --> 00:29:22,206
It doesn't seem to hurt as much now.

566
00:29:22,207 --> 00:29:23,777
And the swelling has gone down a bit.

567
00:29:24,487 --> 00:29:26,777
This is good.
I'll take some back for Lian Hong.

568
00:29:27,088 --> 00:29:28,857
This is expensive medicine.

569
00:29:30,687 --> 00:29:31,658
Take it.

570
00:29:31,767 --> 00:29:33,418
Consider it my apology to you.

571
00:29:33,487 --> 00:29:35,206
Also, I'll promise

572
00:29:35,207 --> 00:29:36,619
I will slim your waist.

573
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:38,046
This is about my reputation.

574
00:29:38,047 --> 00:29:39,847
I'll make a new prescription right away.

575
00:29:39,848 --> 00:29:42,816
Aren't you in the capital
to take the imperial exam?

576
00:29:42,817 --> 00:29:44,607
Why do you spend every day
doing other things?

577
00:29:44,608 --> 00:29:45,766
I see Xuan and Shan

578
00:29:45,767 --> 00:29:47,577
studying every day.

579
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:49,127
I'm gifted.

580
00:29:49,128 --> 00:29:51,418
Studying two days
before the exam is enough.

581
00:30:02,309 --> 00:30:04,480
You all have the same teacher.

582
00:30:04,808 --> 00:30:07,807
How come Xuan always gets praised,

583
00:30:07,808 --> 00:30:09,817
but you can't even write

584
00:30:10,007 --> 00:30:11,607
a comprehensible essay?

585
00:30:11,608 --> 00:30:14,880
Is it that hard to write a coherent essay?

586
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:17,480
When Xuan has questions,
the teacher explains everything in detail,

587
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,720
but with me, I get no patience.

588
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,297
Even your own mother is running
out of patience with you.

589
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,040
No wonder the teacher isn't kind either.

590
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,607
Rewrite these

591
00:30:24,608 --> 00:30:26,938
before tomorrow.

592
00:30:27,487 --> 00:30:28,726
Why are you complaining?

593
00:30:28,727 --> 00:30:30,258
Go rewrite them now!

594
00:30:31,128 --> 00:30:32,178
Young Master Shan.

595
00:30:42,808 --> 00:30:44,407
Madam, don't worry too much.

596
00:30:44,408 --> 00:30:45,817
Young Master Shan is still young.

597
00:30:46,455 --> 00:30:48,346
Young?

598
00:30:48,408 --> 00:30:50,418
The triennial provincial exam
is right around the corner.

599
00:30:50,487 --> 00:30:52,286
With his current abilities,

600
00:30:52,287 --> 00:30:54,138
how is he going to pass?

601
00:30:54,767 --> 00:30:57,440
If he doesn't pass this year,
he'll have to wait another three years.

602
00:30:57,455 --> 00:30:59,927
Back when my first son was only four,

603
00:30:59,928 --> 00:31:01,418
he had already begun his studies.

604
00:31:01,848 --> 00:31:04,246
He was brilliant
and everyone praised him.

605
00:31:04,247 --> 00:31:06,218
If he were still here,

606
00:31:06,767 --> 00:31:09,258
would I have to worry like this?

607
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,589
Madam,

608
00:31:11,128 --> 00:31:13,458
it's been years since he passed away.

609
00:31:13,911 --> 00:31:15,601
Please don't be so sad.

610
00:31:15,951 --> 00:31:19,120
Yixiu is greedy, Shanyuan is lazy,

611
00:31:19,830 --> 00:31:22,750
and only Yiyu is well-behaved.

612
00:31:22,751 --> 00:31:26,081
But she's just a girl.

613
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,010
Why is my life

614
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,731
so bitter?

615
00:31:30,798 --> 00:31:32,209
Rest assured, Madam.

616
00:31:32,310 --> 00:31:35,001
Young Master Shan will surely
amount to something.

617
00:31:35,350 --> 00:31:36,521
That's right.

618
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:39,030
What did my brother say
about hiring an esteemed teacher

619
00:31:39,031 --> 00:31:40,470
for Shan?

620
00:31:40,471 --> 00:31:42,482
I was just about to tell you.

621
00:31:42,850 --> 00:31:44,094
First Master Chen sent this.

622
00:31:44,095 --> 00:31:46,270
Please take a look.

623
00:31:46,271 --> 00:31:48,030
Set up a time for me.

624
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:50,030
I'll request their services myself.

625
00:31:50,031 --> 00:31:51,349
If Shan is recommended

626
00:31:51,350 --> 00:31:53,895
by a famous scholar,

627
00:31:53,896 --> 00:31:56,625
perhaps he can get

628
00:31:57,271 --> 00:31:59,001
a government position.

629
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:04,699
Young Master Xuan,

630
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:06,550
Second Master is waiting for you
in the study.

631
00:32:07,848 --> 00:32:10,241
Second Master only called for him.

632
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:25,487
Go back and continue studying.

633
00:32:25,488 --> 00:32:28,361
I expect a new essay
for me to review in a few days.

634
00:32:30,671 --> 00:32:31,761
Xuanyuan,

635
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:35,109
the provincial exam is approaching.
You cannot slack off.

636
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:37,261
I want you to succeed

637
00:32:37,262 --> 00:32:39,193
and bring honour to the Luo family.

638
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:42,081
Yes, Father.

639
00:32:42,959 --> 00:32:43,888
You may leave.

640
00:32:48,511 --> 00:32:49,640
Is there anything else?

641
00:32:52,848 --> 00:32:53,857
Speak.

642
00:32:54,377 --> 00:32:57,188
Are you still so upset
with Mistress Qiao

643
00:32:57,711 --> 00:33:00,041
that yon't even see Yilian?

644
00:33:01,411 --> 00:33:03,051
No matter
what mistakes Mistress Qiao made,

645
00:33:03,052 --> 00:33:04,571
Yilian is still

646
00:33:04,572 --> 00:33:06,380
your own flesh and blood.

647
00:33:06,381 --> 00:33:08,392
Don't meddle in matters
of the inner courtyard.

648
00:33:08,618 --> 00:33:09,908
Put all your focus

649
00:33:09,971 --> 00:33:11,581
on your studies.

650
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,010
Ever since Mistress Qiao left,

651
00:33:13,011 --> 00:33:15,462
the conditions at Bilian Pavilion
have worsened.

652
00:33:15,491 --> 00:33:16,741
Yilian tries her best for my sake,

653
00:33:17,011 --> 00:33:19,862
but they shun her with disdain.

654
00:33:20,052 --> 00:33:21,571
Recently, the heat has been unbearable.

655
00:33:21,572 --> 00:33:23,051
Yilian, feeling sorry for me,

656
00:33:23,052 --> 00:33:24,410
tried to have someone bring ice,

657
00:33:24,411 --> 00:33:25,862
but it never worked out.

658
00:33:31,491 --> 00:33:33,222
Do you see any ice

659
00:33:34,052 --> 00:33:35,541
in my study?

660
00:33:35,651 --> 00:33:38,170
Can you not study without ice?

661
00:33:38,171 --> 00:33:40,771
What does it mean to "harden one's sinews
and temper one's mind"?

662
00:33:40,772 --> 00:33:42,210
Many poor scholars

663
00:33:42,211 --> 00:33:43,970
in rundown homes eat coarse food

664
00:33:43,971 --> 00:33:45,371
and eventually become great scholars,

665
00:33:45,372 --> 00:33:47,222
respected by all.

666
00:33:50,292 --> 00:33:52,091
You're just living

667
00:33:52,092 --> 00:33:54,650
a little less comfortably than before.

668
00:33:54,651 --> 00:33:55,781
If you can't endure

669
00:33:56,731 --> 00:33:59,541
this small hardship,

670
00:33:59,812 --> 00:34:00,942
how will you

671
00:34:02,321 --> 00:34:04,651
achieve greatness?

672
00:34:08,892 --> 00:34:10,022
Xuan.

673
00:34:11,242 --> 00:34:12,371
Xuan.

674
00:34:13,292 --> 00:34:14,102
Xuan.

675
00:34:17,531 --> 00:34:19,142
Is this all the dishes?

676
00:34:19,732 --> 00:34:22,251
The kitchen said each household
has its rations.

677
00:34:22,252 --> 00:34:25,251
Bilian Pavilion used to prepare
its own meals

678
00:34:25,252 --> 00:34:26,651
and ate too well.

679
00:34:26,652 --> 00:34:28,410
What kind of nonsense is that? You…

680
00:34:28,411 --> 00:34:29,542
Xuan.

681
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:36,771
Xuan, just make do and eat something.

682
00:34:36,772 --> 00:34:38,251
You still have to study.

683
00:34:38,252 --> 00:34:40,570
I'll make some snacks for you
in the afternoon.

684
00:34:40,571 --> 00:34:41,651
I'll sell some jewellery

685
00:34:41,652 --> 00:34:43,371
to buy you some ice.

686
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:45,622
You just focus on studying.

687
00:34:46,252 --> 00:34:48,339
This isn't just about
the ice or the meals!

688
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,829
This is humiliation!

689
00:34:50,411 --> 00:34:53,490
Which is why you need to work harder,
study diligently,

690
00:34:53,491 --> 00:34:55,142
and rise to the top.

691
00:34:55,212 --> 00:34:57,450
Father only has you as a son.

692
00:34:57,451 --> 00:34:59,251
Even though he's harsh on you now,

693
00:34:59,252 --> 00:35:01,050
if you pass with flying colours,

694
00:35:01,051 --> 00:35:03,901
we can return to the life we once had.

695
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:07,429
Then our mother will have
a chance to come back.

696
00:35:10,692 --> 00:35:12,371
She was given 50 strikes

697
00:35:12,372 --> 00:35:13,741
and sent to the countryside.

698
00:35:15,051 --> 00:35:18,022
Who knows what her life is like now?

699
00:35:18,732 --> 00:35:19,941
Xuan,

700
00:35:20,172 --> 00:35:22,301
you're our only hope.

701
00:35:31,172 --> 00:35:32,970
I wonder if she even has decent food

702
00:35:32,971 --> 00:35:35,741
in the countryside.

703
00:35:35,812 --> 00:35:37,182
I understand.

704
00:35:37,892 --> 00:35:40,341
I'm studying hard every day, aren't I?

705
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:44,381
Eat more.

706
00:36:03,044 --> 00:36:05,561
You're practising your calligraphy

707
00:36:05,562 --> 00:36:09,613
yet you are restless.

708
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:12,109
How could you write with a steady hand?

709
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:16,099
Grandmother,

710
00:36:16,100 --> 00:36:18,510
I'm still recovering.

711
00:36:18,701 --> 00:36:20,511
I must not be feeling well.

712
00:36:21,491 --> 00:36:24,291
You've always been like that.
Whenever you practise writing,

713
00:36:24,292 --> 00:36:27,502
suddenly everything hurts
and you're uncomfortable.

714
00:36:28,732 --> 00:36:30,259
Practising calligraphy

715
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:33,389
is about honing
your patience and character.

716
00:36:33,652 --> 00:36:36,622
You didn't practice enough
when you were a child.

717
00:36:37,011 --> 00:36:38,970
No wonder your father says

718
00:36:38,971 --> 00:36:41,381
your handwriting lacks strength.

719
00:36:41,715 --> 00:36:43,050
All right.

720
00:36:43,051 --> 00:36:45,861
I'll arrange for a tutor

721
00:36:46,198 --> 00:36:48,410
to teach you.

722
00:36:48,411 --> 00:36:49,741
A tutor?

723
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,544
There's no need for that.

724
00:36:51,545 --> 00:36:53,596
We have one right at home.

725
00:36:55,905 --> 00:36:56,835
Who?

726
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,550
Help me up.

727
00:37:07,051 --> 00:37:08,381
Look at this.

728
00:37:08,953 --> 00:37:10,643
This is Third Brother's handwriting.

729
00:37:11,297 --> 00:37:14,031
Dignified and powerful,
with great presence.

730
00:37:14,032 --> 00:37:15,283
Look.

731
00:37:15,337 --> 00:37:16,979
Not only does he write well,

732
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:19,190
but he also composes excellent essays.

733
00:37:20,927 --> 00:37:24,616
Sharp words and good force.
Impactful and impressionable.

734
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:31,550
Despite your father always disliking him

735
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:34,631
and no one teaching him properly,

736
00:37:34,821 --> 00:37:37,671
he managed to write so well.

737
00:37:40,191 --> 00:37:42,561
It's due to his diligence and efforts.

738
00:37:43,451 --> 00:37:45,790
Grandmother, are there any great scholars
in the imperial court who,

739
00:37:45,791 --> 00:37:48,579
like my third brother,
come from humble origins

740
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:50,510
but succeeded through self-study?

741
00:37:52,341 --> 00:37:55,099
You brought so many things

742
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,500
to show me,

743
00:37:56,501 --> 00:37:59,311
and now you've spoken on his behalf.

744
00:37:59,366 --> 00:38:01,535
What's your

745
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:03,870
real motive?

746
00:38:06,021 --> 00:38:07,151
Grandmother,

747
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,470
I want to help him
enter the family registry.

748
00:38:09,557 --> 00:38:11,091
I want him to be officially recognised

749
00:38:11,092 --> 00:38:13,063
in Luo's Residence.

750
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:17,671
Did he ask you to do this?

751
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,711
Of course not.

752
00:38:19,781 --> 00:38:20,940
He's always been there

753
00:38:20,941 --> 00:38:23,671
to protect and help me.

754
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:26,590
I just wanted to do something
for him in return.

755
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,711
This will be difficult.

756
00:38:30,861 --> 00:38:33,020
Your father has always held a grudge

757
00:38:33,021 --> 00:38:35,030
against his birth mother.

758
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,780
That's why he hasn't allowed him
into the family registry,

759
00:38:37,781 --> 00:38:40,139
keeping him merely
living in the household.

760
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:41,671
To have him acknowledge him as a son?

761
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:43,351
That would be difficult.

762
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:44,751
Grandmother,

763
00:38:44,901 --> 00:38:46,510
as long as you agree,

764
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:49,139
there will always be a way
to convince Father.

765
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:50,430
Besides,

766
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:54,990
if he could take the imperial exam
as a member of the Luo family and pass,

767
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:57,059
wouldn't that bring great honour

768
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:59,470
to our family?

769
00:39:00,941 --> 00:39:02,068
All right.

770
00:39:02,069 --> 00:39:05,879
I'll think about it.

771
00:39:13,981 --> 00:39:15,111
Yining,

772
00:39:15,406 --> 00:39:17,376
did you really talk to Old Madam

773
00:39:17,718 --> 00:39:19,407
about putting me in the family registry?

774
00:39:21,861 --> 00:39:23,659
I always keep my word.

775
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:26,139
She wasn't opposed to the idea
when I brought it up.

776
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:29,030
Grandmother has good judgment
and can recognise talent.

777
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:32,259
I feel that this matter

778
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:34,340
won't be as easy as you think.

779
00:39:34,341 --> 00:39:36,510
I don't want you to end up
in a difficult position.

780
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:38,619
Leave this matter to me.

781
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:40,111
I'm confident.

782
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,380
Stop fiddling with that plant.

783
00:39:42,381 --> 00:39:44,259
Just focus on your studies
and prepare for the exam.

784
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:46,111
All you need to do is succeed.

785
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:48,990
Got it.

786
00:39:50,535 --> 00:39:53,139
Shenyuan, come and take a look

787
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:55,711
at my writing. Have I improved a bit?

788
00:40:16,941 --> 00:40:18,751
Your strokes are not balanced.

789
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:25,910
It's crooked.
Handwriting reflects the person.

790
00:40:26,381 --> 00:40:27,699
Your characters lack proper form.

791
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,619
At the very least,

792
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:31,870
your writing should be upright.

793
00:40:31,989 --> 00:40:33,878
Let me show you how it's done.

794
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,070
(Yining)

795
00:40:53,407 --> 00:40:55,018
You shouldn't teach me anymore.

796
00:40:55,125 --> 00:40:56,815
Go back to your plants.

797
00:41:20,901 --> 00:41:23,550
It appears you've aroused
Lu Jiaxue's suspicion too.

798
00:41:28,941 --> 00:41:30,420
How about this?

799
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:32,030
Bring more people along

800
00:41:32,461 --> 00:41:34,431
when you go out from now on.

801
00:41:34,781 --> 00:41:35,820
And

802
00:41:35,821 --> 00:41:37,870
if we ever run into danger again,

803
00:41:37,965 --> 00:41:39,699
don't try to protect me.

804
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,070
You must run away.

805
00:41:41,341 --> 00:41:42,631
I can't do that!

806
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:45,020
You've saved me
from danger countless times.

807
00:41:45,021 --> 00:41:47,070
How could I not protect you?

808
00:41:48,096 --> 00:41:51,179
♪Stirring up trouble, loneliness,
stirring up a sky full of fireworks♪

809
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:56,806
♪Through the trials we faced,

810
00:41:56,821 --> 00:41:58,219
Young Master. Seventh Lady.

811
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:59,980
Physician Qi's disciple has been found.

812
00:41:59,981 --> 00:42:02,820
Good. Change into Xue Zhi's clothes.

813
00:42:02,821 --> 00:42:04,139
We'll head out together.

814
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:05,271
All right.

815
00:42:22,341 --> 00:42:23,470
Seventh Lady Luo,

816
00:42:23,743 --> 00:42:26,754
here are all the medical records
my master kept for Madam Gu.

817
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:34,179
Madam Gu's body was weakened

818
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:35,219
after childbirth,

819
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,548
so Luo's Residence asked my master
to help with her recovery.

820
00:42:37,549 --> 00:42:40,769
Did Physician Qi keep
all the records of her treatment?

821
00:42:42,422 --> 00:42:43,791
Not all.

822
00:42:44,301 --> 00:42:45,590
You may speak freely.

823
00:42:46,621 --> 00:42:47,791
My master said

824
00:42:47,861 --> 00:42:49,980
that although Madam Gu was weakened,

825
00:42:49,981 --> 00:42:51,499
with proper care,

826
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:52,870
she could have recovered.

827
00:42:53,485 --> 00:42:54,980
But after

828
00:42:54,981 --> 00:42:56,539
a few doses of medicine,

829
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,340
though she showed improvement,

830
00:42:58,341 --> 00:43:00,030
she suddenly passed away.

831
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:02,019
My master found it puzzling,

832
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:03,699
so he kept all the records

833
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:05,231
and often reviewed them.

834
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:08,550
My mother passed suddenly?

835
00:43:10,669 --> 00:43:12,029
Physician Qi had doubts

836
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:14,561
about her death as well?

837
00:43:16,667 --> 00:43:18,997
Perhaps there were some doubts
about the situation,

838
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:22,059
or maybe there were
undiscovered issues in her illness.

839
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:23,440
We cannot say for sure.

840
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:26,040
Did Physician Qi ever prescribe
Mongolian milkvetch and peony tonic

841
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:27,617
for my mother?

842
00:43:27,821 --> 00:43:28,671
He did.

843
00:43:34,861 --> 00:43:36,111
Here it is on this page.

844
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:39,111
It's a common restorative prescription

845
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:41,671
and generally consistent.

846
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:44,059
Could someone have tampered

847
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:46,107
with the content?

848
00:43:46,108 --> 00:43:47,958
I personally handled all the herbs

849
00:43:47,981 --> 00:43:50,179
and prepared the medicine
under my master's guidance,

850
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:52,111
and he himself delivered it.

851
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:54,349
My master found

852
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:56,071
Madam Gu's sudden death odd.

853
00:43:56,212 --> 00:43:59,343
He thoroughly checked the medicine
multiple times but found nothing unusual.

854
00:43:59,668 --> 00:44:00,878
So

855
00:44:00,966 --> 00:44:03,813
the tonic wasn't the problem?

856
00:44:03,814 --> 00:44:05,863
There's nothing wrong
with the medicine he prescribed.

857
00:44:06,021 --> 00:44:07,991
There shouldn't be anything wrong
with the preparation

858
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:09,869
and concoction of the medicine either.

859
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:11,790
