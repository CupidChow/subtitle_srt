00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,400
=The Rise of Ning=

2
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,320
(Adapted from Wen Tan's novel "Chancellor
Training Handbook" from Jinjiang Literature)

3
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,813
=Episode 8=

4
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,508
(Luo's Residence)

5
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:48,160
Ms. Xue Zhi.

6
00:01:48,976 --> 00:01:50,080
What's got you in such a panic

7
00:01:50,199 --> 00:01:51,080
so early this morning?

8
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:51,824
Third Young Master,

9
00:01:51,888 --> 00:01:53,250
Seventh Lady was exhausted last night.

10
00:01:53,312 --> 00:01:53,950
She woke up

11
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:55,160
with a fever

12
00:01:55,184 --> 00:01:56,280
and started spouting nonsense.

13
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,740
She refused to let me call Physician Du,

14
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:58,670
worried that Old Madam...

15
00:01:58,679 --> 00:01:59,280
Understood.

16
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:00,959
Bring Physician Du over

17
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:02,360
from Muxi Hall discreetly.

18
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:02,800
Yes.

19
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,590
Don't let others know.

20
00:02:04,032 --> 00:02:04,528
All right.

21
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,280
I'll go with you.

22
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,200
Bring a wet towel.

23
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:17,040
Yes.

24
00:02:22,719 --> 00:02:23,520
Don't go.

25
00:03:01,159 --> 00:03:01,959
Physician Du.

26
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,360
It's you.

27
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:05,719
Please take a look at Seventh Lady.

28
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,559
Yes.

29
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,119
How is she?

30
00:03:25,999 --> 00:03:26,999
Has she been exposed

31
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,080
to cold water recently?

32
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:29,719
Yes.

33
00:03:31,056 --> 00:03:32,270
And with these last few days

34
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,520
of her being in the rain

35
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,719
to ask me to treat Old Madam Luo

36
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,999
and overworking herself.

37
00:03:36,119 --> 00:03:37,439
I am at fault too.

38
00:03:37,559 --> 00:03:39,240
I'll prescribe some medicine.

39
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,119
Once she takes them,

40
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,760
the cold and fever

41
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,920
will subside.

42
00:03:45,279 --> 00:03:45,999
Thank you.

43
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,760
That's great to hear.

44
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,520
There is one thing, though…

45
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,679
Xue Zhi, take good care of her.

46
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:53,719
Yes.

47
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,240
What's your relationship with this lady?

48
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,279
Why did you say

49
00:04:11,399 --> 00:04:13,439
you weren't part of the Luo's Residence?

50
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,720
It's complicated.

51
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,800
It's not a story
that can be explained in a few words.

52
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,199
I hope you understand.

53
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:22,920
Seventh Lady considers me

54
00:04:23,119 --> 00:04:24,720
her third brother.

55
00:04:24,896 --> 00:04:26,384
So if there's something important

56
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,600
you feel is necessary to share,

57
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,800
do tell me.

58
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,679
From her pulse,

59
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:36,360
there's something concerning.

60
00:04:37,559 --> 00:04:38,519
She was born

61
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:42,840
with a weak constitution.

62
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,280
I suspect that during her birth,

63
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,040
her mother might have taken

64
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,439
a large amount

65
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:50,920
of labor-inducing medicine.

66
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,999
She was likely born prematurely.

67
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,319
Labor-inducing medicine?

68
00:05:02,119 --> 00:05:04,040
I've heard that Madam Gu

69
00:05:04,119 --> 00:05:06,720
had a difficult labor,

70
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,040
and that led to her early death.

71
00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:12,280
But only her old servants

72
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,720
might know the full details

73
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,439
of that time.

74
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,119
That complicates things.

75
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,360
This weakness originated from birth.

76
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:21,079
I'll need to know exactly

77
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,160
what medicine was used

78
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,319
to help

79
00:05:24,519 --> 00:05:27,920
treat her thoroughly.

80
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,879
So, what does that mean?

81
00:05:30,999 --> 00:05:32,400
At present,

82
00:05:32,519 --> 00:05:34,199
she seems no different from others,

83
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,199
but when it comes time
for her to give birth,

84
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,400
it will be high risk.

85
00:05:41,559 --> 00:05:44,360
And as she ages,

86
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,679
her health will continue to decline.

87
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,920
Thank you, Physician Du.

88
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,400
Please rest here for a moment.

89
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:57,879
Also,

90
00:05:58,199 --> 00:05:59,400
please don't mention any of this

91
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,079
to Seventh Lady,

92
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,800
so she won't worry unnecessarily.

93
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:10,999
I take my leave.

94
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,240
Go find the old servants

95
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,160
who served Madam Gu

96
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,600
and bring them to me

97
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:24,480
if they are still in the capital.

98
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,600
Young Master, what are you planning now?

99
00:06:26,679 --> 00:06:27,400
Just go.

100
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,800
Understood.

101
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:50,600
Young Lady.

102
00:06:50,624 --> 00:06:51,920
Young Lady, you've finally woken up.

103
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,360
You had me worried sick.

104
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,160
My illness hasn't

105
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,639
alarmed Grandma, has it?

106
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,360
No.

107
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,879
Third Young Master discreetly

108
00:07:00,999 --> 00:07:01,960
brought over Physician Du.

109
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:03,840
He only left after your fever went down.

110
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,079
Not even Madam Lin

111
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,119
or the others know yet.

112
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:13,360
Seventh Lady, Physician Du has arrived.

113
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,840
You must be

114
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,800
Song Zhi, the one sent by Mother?

115
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,040
Seventh Lady, I'm here to serve you.

116
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:20,999
Before I came,

117
00:07:21,119 --> 00:07:22,519
Madam Lin specifically instructed me

118
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:23,800
to serve you

119
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:24,679
with all my heart.

120
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,679
I shall do

121
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,576
anything you ask

122
00:07:26,608 --> 00:07:27,610
and shan't question anything

123
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:28,679
you don't want me to do.

124
00:07:28,999 --> 00:07:30,280
A clever one.

125
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,400
Bring Physician Du in.

126
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:34,319
Yes.

127
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:44,864
Physician Du, please come in.

128
00:07:44,912 --> 00:07:45,430
All right.

129
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,160
Physician Du.

130
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,584
No need for formalities, Young Lady.

131
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,920
It seems you've recovered well.

132
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,920
This is a new prescription.

133
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,240
After taking it, you'll be fine.

134
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:58,720
Old Madam

135
00:07:58,800 --> 00:07:59,920
is also stable.

136
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:02,319
I'll come every three days

137
00:08:02,336 --> 00:08:03,290
to administer acupuncture,

138
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:04,720
so you need not worry.

139
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:05,800
Physician Du.

140
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:07,360
I cannot thank you enough.

141
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:09,160
If there's anything you need,

142
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,759
don't hesitate to ask.

143
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,240
I will do everything I can.

144
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:15,280
It's my duty as a physician to heal.

145
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,160
You need not burden yourself.

146
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:19,240
Thank you.

147
00:08:19,679 --> 00:08:21,960
Song Zhi, see Physician Du out.

148
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:22,480
Yes.

149
00:08:22,559 --> 00:08:23,040
Yes.

150
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,559
Physician Du, this way.

151
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:28,879
Young Lady,

152
00:08:29,079 --> 00:08:30,999
Physician Du truly has
the heart of a healer.

153
00:08:31,119 --> 00:08:31,960
Physician Li mentioned

154
00:08:32,079 --> 00:08:33,080
that one of the ingredients

155
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,890
in Physician Du's prescription
is top-grade ambergris.

156
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:35,840
It's rare and priceless.

157
00:08:35,872 --> 00:08:37,680
A few years ago,
the palace was in urgent need

158
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:39,080
and paid a fortune to acquire it.

159
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,200
That precious?

160
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,720
And we haven't even paid
for the consultation.

161
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,080
Where did the ambergris

162
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,600
come from?

163
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,919
Xue Zhi. Xue Zhi.

164
00:09:07,159 --> 00:09:07,720
Young Lady,

165
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:09,159
the servants we sent out

166
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,960
just reported that Bi Yi suspiciously

167
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,799
left the residence.

168
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,216
She claimed she was buying fabric,

169
00:09:13,232 --> 00:09:14,940
but instead headed
to the east side of the city.

170
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,119
But Mistress Qiao's usual

171
00:09:16,128 --> 00:09:17,320
fabric store is on the west side

172
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,039
at Liujin Fabrics.

173
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,159
Are those servants reliable?

174
00:09:25,424 --> 00:09:28,039
They are from Madam Lin's family
in Lin'an.

175
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,360
Good. Let's go have a look.

176
00:09:31,759 --> 00:09:32,279
Young Lady,

177
00:09:32,639 --> 00:09:34,240
you've just recovered.

178
00:09:39,159 --> 00:09:40,799
What's wrong with you all?

179
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:42,080
Our mistress

180
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,320
is furious.

181
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,600
She wants Fifth Master Qiao
to punish you.

182
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,960
We didn't expect that little girl

183
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,960
to be so feisty.

184
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:50,440
Look at this cut she made

185
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:51,680
on his hand with the scissors.

186
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,360
Who wants to look

187
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:54,720
at your useless filth?

188
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,039
You can't even handle a little girl.

189
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,799
You all had better

190
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:00,200
leave the capital at once!

191
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:01,320
As fast as possible!

192
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,560
Yes.

193
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:14,759
Young Lady,

194
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,360
should we report this
to the authorities?

195
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:16,999
These people

196
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:18,240
are ruthless murderers.

197
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,399
We can't report it yet.

198
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,480
If we do,

199
00:10:20,544 --> 00:10:21,559
Yuanjing Pavilion incident

200
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,576
will come to light as well.

201
00:10:22,608 --> 00:10:23,320
Then should I call

202
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,600
Third Young Master and Shao'an?

203
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,320
Don't go just yet.

204
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,600
He's just been injured.

205
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:29,200
Third Young Master is injured?

206
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,159
When did this happen?

207
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:31,919
Don't worry about that now.

208
00:10:32,039 --> 00:10:32,960
Just do as I say.

209
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,919
Understand?

210
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:44,119
Let's go.

211
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:50,720
Stop!

212
00:10:50,768 --> 00:10:51,248
Don't move!

213
00:10:51,328 --> 00:10:52,150
Stop!

214
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:53,919
Mercy!

215
00:10:54,039 --> 00:10:54,560
Don't move!

216
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,039
Young Lady,

217
00:11:00,159 --> 00:11:01,519
they've confessed.

218
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:03,440
Why not take them back
to Luo's Residence

219
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,080
and confront Mistress Qiao?

220
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,799
Be patient.

221
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,279
I have my plans.

222
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,360
Find a place

223
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,759
to lock them up for now.

224
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,560
Sweetsops.

225
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,759
Sweet and sour sweetsops.

226
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:16,480
Only folks

227
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,999
in the rural areas enjoy these fruits.

228
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:18,919
They're small and sour.

229
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,240
Who in the capital would buy them?

230
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:20,879
Young Lady,

231
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,600
do you remember

232
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,720
when you used to love

233
00:11:22,736 --> 00:11:24,192
picking sweetsops at the other estate?

234
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,879
Sweetsops.

235
00:11:26,119 --> 00:11:28,840
Sweet and sour sweetsops.

236
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,600
Take a look at my sweetsops.

237
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:32,720
That old woman is so old,

238
00:11:32,752 --> 00:11:33,890
yet she still hawks her goods

239
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,320
on the streets in the harsh weather.

240
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,560
Stop the carriage.

241
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,320
Miss, would you like
to buy some sweetsops?

242
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:47,919
Ma'am,

243
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,240
why not let me help you
sell these sweetsops?

244
00:11:51,119 --> 00:11:51,759
All right.

245
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:15,480
♪South wind weaves
a brocade tapestry of lives♪

246
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,408
♪Begonias lean on each other
in front of a turquoise pond♪

247
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:19,999
Lucky fruits for sale.

248
00:12:20,119 --> 00:12:22,119
Sweet and sour lucky fruits.

249
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,320
Take a look at the lucky fruits.

250
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,600
(Wonton)
Miss, have a look.

251
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,879
One for long life and happiness.

252
00:12:26,999 --> 00:12:28,759
Two for blessings and prosperity.

253
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,560
Give me two.

254
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,200
Young Lady, you have skillful hands.

255
00:12:33,216 --> 00:12:34,790
You even taught her
a clever sales pitch.

256
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:37,759
Sticking the character on the fruit

257
00:12:37,879 --> 00:12:39,560
seems a bit forced still.

258
00:12:40,039 --> 00:12:41,200
It would be better

259
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,399
if it grew on the fruit

260
00:12:42,519 --> 00:12:43,560
itself.

261
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:44,999
How could that be possible?

262
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,879
You could place the character
on the fruit

263
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,799
while it's still growing.

264
00:12:49,919 --> 00:12:51,240
When it matures,

265
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,480
the character

266
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,519
will be imprinted on it.

267
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:53,999
Young Lady,

268
00:12:54,119 --> 00:12:55,360
that's a novel idea.

269
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,399
But as a daughter of Luo's Residence,

270
00:12:57,519 --> 00:12:59,159
you'll never need for anything.

271
00:12:59,232 --> 00:13:01,110
Why would you need
to sell fruit on the streets?

272
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,320
Life is unpredictable.

273
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,320
Who knows

274
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,999
what the future holds?

275
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,879
Just like how my mother was born

276
00:13:08,999 --> 00:13:11,560
into the esteemed Gu family

277
00:13:11,799 --> 00:13:14,600
and married into the Luo's Residence,

278
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,999
yet now…

279
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,879
Young Lady,
don't dwell on these things.

280
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,440
How's the investigation into the people

281
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:26,799
from Yuanjing Pavilion going?

282
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:29,519
I am incompetent.

283
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:30,879
After we left,

284
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:33,080
the imperial guards searched
for suspicious individuals

285
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,879
and found a man and a woman nearby,

286
00:13:34,999 --> 00:13:36,440
but they failed to capture them.

287
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,879
A man and a woman?

288
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,680
On the day

289
00:13:38,799 --> 00:13:40,480
we met with Li Yinglong,

290
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,080
I vaguely

291
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,279
saw a woman at the scene,

292
00:13:43,408 --> 00:13:44,360
but she was taken away

293
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,159
by the men in black.

294
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:48,840
However, it was too chaotic

295
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:50,639
at the time,

296
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,159
so I didn't pay much attention

297
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,159
to her.

298
00:13:55,904 --> 00:13:58,110
Many ladies from various families
were present that day.

299
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,840
Has there been any news

300
00:13:59,999 --> 00:14:02,360
of a missing lady
or one that returned late?

301
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,759
There were no such reports.

302
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,759
If she was from a noble family,

303
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:10,039
they would not report it.

304
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:11,680
Understood.

305
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:13,399
I'll send someone to investigate.

306
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,200
Forget it.

307
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:19,440
These people

308
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,200
are either Li Yinglong's accomplices

309
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,560
or remnants of Chen Jiuheng's faction.

310
00:14:24,999 --> 00:14:26,840
They won't cause any trouble for now.

311
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,360
The real issue

312
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,360
is Sun Chengwu's testimony.

313
00:14:32,999 --> 00:14:34,799
Marquis, do you think

314
00:14:35,119 --> 00:14:36,200
what Li Yinglong said

315
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:37,879
about Old Master Luo

316
00:14:37,999 --> 00:14:39,480
hiding a testimony

317
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,680
is true?

318
00:14:41,159 --> 00:14:42,639
Better to believe it

319
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:45,240
than not.

320
00:14:54,119 --> 00:14:54,720
Uncle,

321
00:14:55,799 --> 00:14:57,879
what brings you here?

322
00:14:57,952 --> 00:14:59,960
I heard that ever since
you returned to the capital,

323
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,480
you've been frequenting pleasure houses

324
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,200
and hardly staying at Cheng's Residence.

325
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:05,879
Where else would I find you

326
00:15:05,999 --> 00:15:06,999
but here?

327
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,399
Uncle,

328
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,279
is there a reason

329
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,080
for your visit?

330
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,960
I've heard that your grandma

331
00:15:16,119 --> 00:15:17,840
and Old Madam Luo were acquaintances.

332
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,240
They grew up together.

333
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,080
They still keep in touch.

334
00:15:23,919 --> 00:15:24,919
In that case,

335
00:15:24,999 --> 00:15:27,799
shouldn't you pay a visit
to Luo's Residence?

336
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,600
Of course.

337
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,200
Do let me know what you need me to do.

338
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:34,480
Li Yinglong said

339
00:15:34,544 --> 00:15:35,840
Luo's Residence has the testimony.

340
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:37,910
Go to Luo's Residence
and find that testimony

341
00:15:37,999 --> 00:15:39,159
for me.

342
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:41,320
Understood.

343
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,720
Wait.

344
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,960
Where did you get that thing?

345
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,519
This?

346
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:51,799
An old woman

347
00:15:51,879 --> 00:15:52,919
was selling it on the street.

348
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:55,080
It's just a common fruit
from the countryside,

349
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,840
but the name caught my attention.

350
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,279
She called it a "lucky fruit".

351
00:16:00,879 --> 00:16:02,360
The lady I brought it for likes it,

352
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,560
so I bought it to amuse her.

353
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:07,999
This fruit isn't just

354
00:16:08,119 --> 00:16:09,200
any ordinary fruit.

355
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,119
Its meaning is auspicious.

356
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,960
Buy one for longevity and good fortune.

357
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:13,840
Move aside.

358
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,480
Move.

359
00:16:18,976 --> 00:16:19,870
Where's the person

360
00:16:20,119 --> 00:16:22,279
who cut this character?

361
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,759
Right across the street.

362
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,840
Where did she go?

363
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,759
Young Master, where are you going?

364
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:35,360
I'm going

365
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,399
to check on Seventh Lady.

366
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,480
You've injured yourself,

367
00:16:37,488 --> 00:16:38,790
and you're rushing to check on her.

368
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,680
Shao'an, you've been

369
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:41,840
very talkative lately.

370
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,888
Next time Shopkeeper Zheng
goes to Dianxi to restock,

371
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,750
you can go with him.

372
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,560
Then you'd miss out on some good news

373
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:49,200
I just found out.

374
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:50,560
Quit the suspense and tell me.

375
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,639
It took our men a long time.

376
00:16:52,688 --> 00:16:54,150
It turns out that all of Madam Gu's

377
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,799
old servants have left the capital.

378
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:56,919
But a servant woman

379
00:16:56,999 --> 00:16:58,840
married a farmer named An.

380
00:16:58,896 --> 00:17:00,032
Her husband is a gambler.

381
00:17:00,048 --> 00:17:01,510
He couldn't resist the temptation here,

382
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:02,360
so he forced that An

383
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,759
to move back here.

384
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,200
Where is she now?

385
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:06,880
Coincidentally,

386
00:17:06,912 --> 00:17:08,680
the man is currently detained
in a gambling den.

387
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:09,599
Mr. Li from the den

388
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:10,960
knows Shopkeeper Zheng.

389
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:11,960
Mr. Li said that An

390
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,279
would surely be there today.

391
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:15,359
Let's go.

392
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:20,359
Please, sirs,

393
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,799
have mercy

394
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,359
and release my husband!

395
00:17:23,519 --> 00:17:25,759
If you want to live, pay up.

396
00:17:25,999 --> 00:17:27,359
Or we'll take a pair of eyes

397
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:28,440
as per the rules

398
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:29,279
and let you both go.

399
00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:31,400
No!

400
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,160
Mrs. An,

401
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,559
there's a way

402
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,680
to save your husband.

403
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:37,960
You used to serve Madam Gu

404
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:39,720
from Luo's Residence, didn't you?

405
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:45,839
No.

406
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:46,759
I…

407
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,880
I don't know any Madam Gu.

408
00:17:54,513 --> 00:17:55,473
Then forget it.

409
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:58,480
Proceed as planned.

410
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,559
Dear!

411
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,640
Dear! Save me!

412
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:04,039
Save me!

413
00:18:05,519 --> 00:18:06,960
Who are you people?

414
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:07,799
Why are you asking

415
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,160
about Madam Gu?

416
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,920
What do you want to know?

417
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,279
Never return to the capital,

418
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,640
or your lives will be in danger.

419
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,960
- Understood.
- Understood.

420
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,920
Escort them out, and keep a close watch.

421
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:28,880
Yes.

422
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,200
(Should I tell her the truth?)

423
00:18:44,494 --> 00:18:48,011
(East Street)

424
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,999
Young Lady, it's getting late.

425
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,240
We should head back.

426
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,319
Yes.

427
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,039
It's time to head back.

428
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,759
I've never appreciated

429
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,999
the capital's night before.

430
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,279
It's actually quite beautiful.

431
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:10,920
I feel a bit reluctant to leave.

432
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,160
That's a cute lantern.

433
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,609
(Lanterns)

434
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,559
You're still not fully recovered.

435
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,640
You shouldn't have snuck out
of the residence.

436
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,960
Aren't you doing the same?

437
00:19:45,839 --> 00:19:48,920
I just happened to be passing by

438
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,519
and saw you.

439
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:53,680
Shao'an.

440
00:20:07,319 --> 00:20:08,480
Thank you.

441
00:20:08,839 --> 00:20:10,400
Physician Du already told me

442
00:20:10,519 --> 00:20:11,759
everything.

443
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,440
That ambergris is worth a fortune.

444
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,319
You really are full of surprises.

445
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,359
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

446
00:20:22,279 --> 00:20:24,559
Since the incident at Yuanjing Pavilion,

447
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,880
I don't even know

448
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,759
which one is the real you are anymore.

449
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:29,720
Are you my third brother
from Luo's Residence,

450
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,200
quiet and unassuming,

451
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,328
or the Third Young Master
capable of obtaining something

452
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,128
as rare as ambergris?

453
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,200
Everyone has

454
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,519
their own secrets,

455
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,120
just like how every lantern shines

456
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,400
with a different brightness.

457
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,799
(Back then,)

458
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:12,920
(Madam Gu and Second Master Luo)

459
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:13,999
(had marital discord,)

460
00:21:14,016 --> 00:21:15,760
(so she moved
to a side yard for some peace.)

461
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:17,519
One day while out,

462
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:19,079
she was abducted

463
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,920
by bandits.

464
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:22,960
(We searched everywhere for her.)

465
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:25,240
(But by the time we found her,)

466
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:27,599
(she was already pregnant.)

467
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,839
Mrs. An,

468
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,640
think carefully before you speak.

469
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,839
I swear it's true.

470
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,759
(At the time, Madam Gu was afraid)

471
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,200
(the Luo family would find out,)

472
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,680
(so she took inducing drugs)

473
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:39,640
(to force the birth
of the child prematurely.)

474
00:21:40,169 --> 00:21:43,209
(She gave birth
before the baby was full-term.)

475
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:46,319
Young Master.

476
00:21:49,759 --> 00:21:51,599
What we heard at the gambling den today

477
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:54,079
must never be spoken of.

478
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:55,640
I understand.

479
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,400
Madam Gu was kind to me.

480
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,240
She was already extremely unfortunate,

481
00:22:01,319 --> 00:22:02,319
marrying the wrong man

482
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:03,999
and being abducted.

483
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,079
No matter what,

484
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:08,759
I must keep this secret for her.

485
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:09,839
But what if

486
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,319
Seventh Lady finds out one day?

487
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,599
She will never know.

488
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:13,759
Understood.

489
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,400
(So, we're not really siblings.)

490
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,960
Young Lady, you're awake.

491
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,759
Xue Zhi.

492
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,279
What kind of person

493
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:58,160
do you think my third brother is?

494
00:22:59,104 --> 00:23:00,680
I don't care what kind of person he is,

495
00:23:00,759 --> 00:23:01,799
as long as

496
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,120
he means you no harm.

497
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,440
He's been very helpful to me.

498
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:10,039
Oh, right. I overheard Shao'an

499
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,120
mentioning that it will be

500
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,359
Third Young Master's birthday
in a few days.

501
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,160
But

502
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,759
since he's never been favored,

503
00:23:15,839 --> 00:23:17,480
he's never celebrated.

504
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,599
Poor him,

505
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,680
not even on his birthday.

506
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:25,839
His birthday.

507
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,279
Luo Yixiu! You!

508
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:49,880
Why can't you control

509
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,480
that mouth of yours?

510
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,880
Still eating! Come back here!

511
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:56,440
Hairu, I'm sorry!

512
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,200
Give me that Fugui! Quickly!

513
00:23:58,559 --> 00:23:59,839
This is the fifth time now!

514
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,319
Do you know how much trouble it took

515
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,920
to get those books?

516
00:24:02,999 --> 00:24:04,400
And now it's all ruined!

517
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,480
Hairu, I promise

518
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:06,960
Fugui won't misbehave again!

519
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:08,920
As if I would believe you! Hand it over!

520
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:09,920
Hurry up!

521
00:24:10,359 --> 00:24:11,319
Did you hear me?

522
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,120
Get back here!

523
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,759
Hairu, stop chasing me!

524
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,999
Stop right there!

525
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:30,200
Why are you here?

526
00:24:30,319 --> 00:24:31,319
Why are you here?

527
00:24:38,599 --> 00:24:40,160
Did you get caught stealing food?

528
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:43,400
Did it cause trouble again?

529
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,680
Why do I even need to lose weight?

530
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:52,799
Eating is one of my greatest
pleasures in life.

531
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:53,799
Without it,

532
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,279
what's the point of living?

533
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:56,680
Fugui just runs around

534
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,200
and makes a mess,

535
00:24:58,279 --> 00:25:00,120
but it doesn't have any other flaws.

536
00:25:01,079 --> 00:25:02,799
Can you really judge someone

537
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:04,599
entirely based on one little flaw?

538
00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:07,079
Being a human is hard.

539
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:09,640
Being a goose is hard too.

540
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,200
I read in an ancient medical journal

541
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:18,120
that women

542
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,640
who gain weight

543
00:25:19,759 --> 00:25:20,200
might not

544
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:21,359
just be eating too much,

545
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,279
but could have digestive issues.

546
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,079
Fat?

547
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,359
Do I look fat?

548
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,599
I'll look into it

549
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,120
and come up with a solution

550
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,240
for you.

551
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,759
You'll help me?

552
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:37,839
Of course.

553
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:39,480
We've been through tough times together.

554
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:40,400
Trust me.

555
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:42,480
Fine.

556
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:43,664
In return,

557
00:25:43,744 --> 00:25:44,688
I'll keep an eye on Fugui

558
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:46,510
and make sure it doesn't cause trouble.

559
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,839
So, it's settled.

560
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,079
We'll help each other. Deal.

561
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,319
Deal.

562
00:25:58,599 --> 00:25:59,759
Yining, it's you.

563
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:01,759
Yining, why are you here?

564
00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:03,759
I want the two of you

565
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,680
to help me organize a birthday banquet.

566
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:08,160
(Jimo House)

567
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:09,599
Is Third Young Master here?

568
00:26:11,999 --> 00:26:12,599
Coming.

569
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,039
Third Young Master.

570
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,920
Does Yining need something?

571
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,440
Third Young Master.

572
00:26:18,519 --> 00:26:19,200
She's craving

573
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:20,640
your loquat liquor

574
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:21,920
and asked me to have you

575
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:23,480
deliver two jars to Haitang Abode.

576
00:26:23,519 --> 00:26:23,839
Alright.

577
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,559
I'll have Shao'an send them over.

578
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,400
Third Young Master,

579
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,839
my lady insists

580
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,720
that you deliver them personally.

581
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,319
All right.

582
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,559
I take my leave.

583
00:26:34,839 --> 00:26:36,480
Seventh Lady is really something,

584
00:26:36,519 --> 00:26:37,920
having you run errands in person.

585
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,640
Your back injury just healed.

586
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:40,839
To get that ambergris,

587
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:41,749
you pushed yourself,

588
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,088
returning in just one day and night.

589
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:43,680
Young Master...

590
00:26:43,690 --> 00:26:44,120
It's fine.

591
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,160
I've pretty much recovered.

592
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,720
Young Master, you spoil her.

593
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,270
She's asking
for two whole jars of liquor.

594
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:51,999
Is she hosting a banquet or something?

595
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:52,720
Besides,

596
00:26:52,759 --> 00:26:53,920
today is your birthday.

597
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:55,880
It's not right to have you
running around.

598
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,720
Mother passed away

599
00:26:57,839 --> 00:26:58,640
on this day.

600
00:26:58,704 --> 00:26:59,960
I've never celebrated my birthday.

601
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,039
You know that.

602
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,079
Now, what was I doing?

603
00:27:04,128 --> 00:27:05,344
Right, getting the liquor.

604
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,408
(Haitang Abode)

605
00:27:10,519 --> 00:27:11,240
Yining.

606
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:14,200
Wishing Third Young Master

607
00:27:14,319 --> 00:27:16,920
a long and prosperous life.
Evergreen like the pine and cypress.

608
00:27:19,359 --> 00:27:20,999
The birthday boy is finally here.

609
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,640
You're here at last.

610
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,912
I was about to faint from hunger.

611
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,799
Shenyuan.

612
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,200
Now that you're a year older,

613
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:30,999
you should be more generous.

614
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:32,559
Thank you, everyone.

615
00:27:33,359 --> 00:27:34,839
But I've never celebrated

616
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,160
my birthday.

617
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,839
We're not throwing a big celebration.

618
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,240
We'll just eat and drink

619
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:40,559
as usual.

620
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,480
No need to worry.

621
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:42,640
Look, you've brought

622
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:43,799
my favorite loquat liquor.

623
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,559
Let's have a few drinks together.

624
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,960
This goes with this.

625
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:52,519
This goes with that.

626
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:55,349
That's the best way
to enjoy the flavor.

627
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:56,480
Your knowledge of spices is more

628
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,750
meticulous than my medicine mixing.

629
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:58,720
Of course.

630
00:27:58,799 --> 00:27:59,759
Different ingredients

631
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,120
require different spices

632
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,400
to bring out

633
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:04,039
their full flavor.

634
00:28:04,359 --> 00:28:06,279
Third Brother.

635
00:28:06,288 --> 00:28:07,920
This is the first time
I've called you that.

636
00:28:07,999 --> 00:28:09,960
Since it's your birthday today,

637
00:28:09,999 --> 00:28:11,120
I'll give you

638
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,360
my freshly prepared
secret blend of spices.

639
00:28:13,408 --> 00:28:14,496
May it enhance your appetite

640
00:28:14,512 --> 00:28:15,830
and make everything more delicious.

641
00:28:15,839 --> 00:28:16,599
Thank you, Yixiu.

642
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,079
Shenyuan,

643
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,240
considering you didn't pay

644
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:22,079
for the last meal you hosted,

645
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,920
I wasn't even going to come.

646
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:26,359
So, don't expect any birthday gift
from me.

647
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:29,519
Uncle,

648
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,359
I was wrong.

649
00:28:31,408 --> 00:28:32,590
I apologize for the offense.

650
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,519
Fine.

651
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,440
Your attitude

652
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:37,519
is sincere enough.

653
00:28:37,568 --> 00:28:38,200
I'll send you my

654
00:28:38,224 --> 00:28:39,600
secret crafted healing salve later.

655
00:28:39,616 --> 00:28:40,350
If you get injured,

656
00:28:40,368 --> 00:28:40,990
it's far better

657
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,079
than anything

658
00:28:42,279 --> 00:28:43,160
you can get

659
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:44,120
from an apothecary.

660
00:28:44,359 --> 00:28:45,319
Thank you, Uncle.

661
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,799
I'll down this cup in respect to you.

662
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,160
Wait!

663
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,599
What fun is it just drinking?

664
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,359
We should play a game.

665
00:28:56,079 --> 00:28:56,960
What's this?

666
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,240
A drinking game.

667
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,120
We'll pass the spoon around and spin it.

668
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:01,720
When it stops,

669
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,590
the person holding it

670
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,039
can ask a question

671
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,200
to the one it points to.

672
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,079
They must answer truthfully.

673
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,279
If they can't answer,

674
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:09,160
they drink.

675
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:10,319
If they answer,

676
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,920
the questioner drinks.

677
00:29:12,039 --> 00:29:12,720
How about it?

678
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:14,279
Sounds good to me.

679
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,759
Show us how it's done.

680
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,039
I'll demonstrate.

681
00:29:25,248 --> 00:29:27,070
A few days ago,
I caught you eating braised lamb

682
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,200
at the waterside pavilion.

683
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,200
What's your waist size?

684
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,319
That's inappropriate!

685
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:33,839
Fine.

686
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:36,039
If you won't answer, then drink.

687
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:37,880
All right.

688
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,880
My turn, right?

689
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:50,160
You…

690
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,599
You came to Luo's Residence
but didn't study.

691
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:55,999
Does your family know?

692
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,120
No, they don't.

693
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:00,880
They don't?

694
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:02,759
You're awfully confident about that.

695
00:30:03,799 --> 00:30:05,120
Fine, I'll drink.

696
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:07,279
I'll make sure

697
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:08,999
you drink half a jar!

698
00:31:02,999 --> 00:31:06,039
Have you ever resented the Luo family?

699
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,480
I used to.

700
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:27,680
And now?

701
00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:32,559
It doesn't matter anymore.

702
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,279
No need.

703
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:48,279
Ask what you want.

704
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:55,880
Do you have anything you cherish?

705
00:32:06,039 --> 00:32:07,359
I suspect that during her birth,

706
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,960
her mother might have taken

707
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:11,519
a large amount

708
00:32:11,599 --> 00:32:13,920
of labor-inducing medicine.

709
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,120
But by the time we found her,

710
00:32:16,319 --> 00:32:18,440
she was already pregnant.

711
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,960
Yining,

712
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,920
even if you weren't part
of Luo's Residence,

713
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:46,039
you'd still be my seventh sister.

714
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,279
Have you had too much to drink?

715
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:52,640
What do you mean,
not part of Luo's Residence?

716
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,920
She's Seventh Lady
of Luo's Residence.

717
00:32:56,519 --> 00:32:57,640
She's not.

718
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,640
Yining's temperament is different

719
00:33:01,759 --> 00:33:02,680
from the rest

720
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:03,599
of Luo's Residence.

721
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,880
Third Brother is right.

722
00:33:05,079 --> 00:33:06,680
Third Brother is right…

723
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:11,079
Are you drunk already?

724
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:15,279
Don't sleep here.

725
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:17,999
I'll help you to the bed.

726
00:33:29,319 --> 00:33:30,200
Third Brother,

727
00:33:31,319 --> 00:33:32,240
I know

728
00:33:32,839 --> 00:33:34,279
you'll risk everything

729
00:33:34,519 --> 00:33:36,440
to accomplish your goal.

730
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:39,160
Your will is as firm as a rock,
unshakable.

731
00:33:40,839 --> 00:33:41,599
But

732
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,680
could you promise me

733
00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:43,839
one thing?

734
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,240
Please don't let harm come

735
00:33:48,039 --> 00:33:49,960
to you or those of the Luo's Residence.

736
00:33:54,279 --> 00:33:54,960
All right.

737
00:33:55,999 --> 00:33:57,440
I promise you.

738
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,399
Then, I won't pry

739
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,359
into the secrets

740
00:34:20,479 --> 00:34:22,080
you keep anymore.

741
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,799
I only hope that you can pursue

742
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:26,319
your goal

743
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,279
through the right path.

744
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,439
So you'll be able

745
00:34:30,759 --> 00:34:31,479
to protect yourself

746
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,120
and those you hold dear.

747
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,880
All right.

748
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,720
I will remember that.

749
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:45,769
♪Sorrows concealed behind brows,
past memories need not be pursue♪

750
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:49,920
♪Your dream, my wish,
intertwined together♪

751
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,600
What were you all doing?

752
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:52,799
Why did you report to me

753
00:34:52,919 --> 00:34:54,240
in the middle of the night?

754
00:34:54,319 --> 00:34:55,600
Seventh Lady wouldn't let us stay.

755
00:34:55,648 --> 00:34:57,080
She said it was a birthday celebration.

756
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,040
I was worried

757
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,759
since it was so late,

758
00:34:59,776 --> 00:35:01,350
so I gathered my courage
and went to check.

759
00:35:01,439 --> 00:35:03,160
Birds of a feather
flock together indeed.

760
00:35:21,919 --> 00:35:23,359
You two, go stand guard outside.

761
00:35:23,439 --> 00:35:24,720
Don't let anyone see this.

762
00:35:24,879 --> 00:35:25,560
Yes.

763
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,279
Rui Xiang,

764
00:35:26,959 --> 00:35:28,439
inform Madam Chen

765
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,000
that the Sixth Lady and Seventh Lady

766
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,040
were up late

767
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,064
and are resting together.

768
00:35:32,096 --> 00:35:32,720
Yes.

769
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,399
You two, wake him up.

770
00:35:35,919 --> 00:35:36,319
Yes.

771
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:38,959
Sixth Master Lin.

772
00:35:39,279 --> 00:35:40,520
Sixth Master Lin, wake up.

773
00:35:40,759 --> 00:35:41,560
Don't touch me!

774
00:35:42,959 --> 00:35:44,120
Sixth Master Lin.

775
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,943
(Haitang Abode)

776
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:49,359
Why is there a bump

777
00:35:49,479 --> 00:35:50,520
on the back of my head?

778
00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:53,200
Did you hit me?

779
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:54,720
It wasn't me.

780
00:35:57,919 --> 00:36:00,120
Shenyuan, was it you?

781
00:36:00,399 --> 00:36:01,560
I never hit anyone.

782
00:36:04,279 --> 00:36:05,479
It wasn't me either.

783
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:12,680
Is this all we're having for breakfast?

784
00:36:14,279 --> 00:36:15,600
Want me to set up a grand feast

785
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,470
of rare delicacies?
Ginseng and abalone, perhaps?

786
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,640
Paired with 60-year-old
pear blossom liquor?

787
00:36:20,759 --> 00:36:21,200
Mother.

788
00:36:21,319 --> 00:36:21,799
No need.

789
00:36:21,879 --> 00:36:22,959
Eating this won't hurt.

790
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,799
My sister truly is a fairy.

791
00:36:24,919 --> 00:36:26,319
So thoughtful and considerate.

792
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,359
Right.

793
00:36:27,439 --> 00:36:29,640
Second Aunt is the kindest person
in the residence.

794
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,879
The porridge here tastes better

795
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:31,630
than anywhere else.

796
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:33,479
Of course.

797
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,640
Not only is my sister gentle,

798
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:36,200
but she also handles finances expertly.

799
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:37,240
Not just Lin'an,

800
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:38,200
but the entire capital

801
00:36:38,319 --> 00:36:39,080
couldn't find another

802
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,359
like her.

803
00:36:40,399 --> 00:36:41,319
Of course.

804
00:36:41,439 --> 00:36:42,520
Mother wears the most

805
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,040
fashionable clothes and accessories.

806
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,000
We can't compare

807
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,399
to her.

808
00:36:46,919 --> 00:36:48,200
Right, Third Brother?

809
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,319
She is indeed the finest.

810
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,959
Don't flatter me.

811
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,959
I've caught you
all red-handed this time.

812
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,279
If you don't behave from now on,

813
00:37:01,439 --> 00:37:03,200
I'll deal with all of you.

814
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,680
Young Master, bad news!

815
00:37:10,759 --> 00:37:11,759
You've finally returned.

816
00:37:11,879 --> 00:37:13,000
Li Yinglong is dead.

817
00:37:20,399 --> 00:37:21,680
Young Master, please punish me.

818
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:30,240
You and I have been through
life and death.

819
00:37:30,399 --> 00:37:32,200
There's no need for this between us.

820
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,240
But my arrow has wasted

821
00:37:36,479 --> 00:37:37,200
everyone's efforts

822
00:37:37,279 --> 00:37:38,560
for so long.

823
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:41,040
Li Yinglong was the only witness.

824
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:44,799
Li Yinglong was too cunning.

825
00:37:44,816 --> 00:37:46,120
He feigned unconsciousness to escape

826
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,130
and wanted to harm someone.

827
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:48,120
If he'd managed to escape,

828
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:48,944
it would've alerted

829
00:37:48,976 --> 00:37:50,080
all the tavern's guests.

830
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,720
I know.

831
00:37:53,439 --> 00:37:55,240
Qi An had no choice.

832
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:56,479
If only we could find

833
00:37:56,528 --> 00:37:57,120
that testimony.

834
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:58,120
But we don't know

835
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,040
when Lu Jiaxue will

836
00:37:59,088 --> 00:38:00,560
make his move
against Luo's Residence.

837
00:38:01,919 --> 00:38:03,200
When two enemies meet,

838
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,200
we'll respond as needed.

839
00:38:05,959 --> 00:38:07,720
We've made it through all these years.

840
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,959
There's nothing to fear.

841
00:38:10,852 --> 00:38:13,395
(Luo's Residence)

842
00:38:13,896 --> 00:38:18,352
(Cheng)

843
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,120
Cheng Lang. Welcome.

844
00:38:26,959 --> 00:38:27,720
This way, please.

845
00:38:33,479 --> 00:38:35,000
Turn here.

846
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:37,080
Slowly. Slowly.

847
00:38:37,104 --> 00:38:37,560
Slowly now.

848
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,879
Turn.

849
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,319
Turn.

850
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,839
Grandma,

851
00:38:45,959 --> 00:38:47,600
you snipped it off again.

852
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,640
Why do I bother with these silly things

853
00:38:50,759 --> 00:38:52,240
when my eyesight

854
00:38:52,359 --> 00:38:53,560
is so poor?

855
00:38:54,319 --> 00:38:55,240
Grandma,

856
00:38:55,319 --> 00:38:56,839
you always say I have no patience,

857
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,080
but I think you're just as impatient.

858
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:00,479
Are you trying

859
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,919
to make me angry

860
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,479
now that I'm feeling better?

861
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,359
Old Madam,

862
00:39:08,464 --> 00:39:09,790
the second son of the Cheng family

863
00:39:09,919 --> 00:39:11,520
has come to pay his respects to you.

864
00:39:13,439 --> 00:39:15,160
The second son of the Cheng family?

865
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:19,040
I see.

866
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,399
Have him wait in the main hall.

867
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,279
Yes.

868
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,560
Grandma,

869
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:29,799
who is the Second Young Master
of the Cheng family?

870
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:34,319
If I remember correctly,
his name is Cheng Lang.

871
00:39:35,799 --> 00:39:38,680
As in Lu Jiaxue's nephew?

872
00:39:38,799 --> 00:39:39,720
That Cheng Lang?

873
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,839
You know him?

874
00:39:43,279 --> 00:39:44,600
I don't.

875
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,270
Yixiu merely mentioned him once

876
00:39:46,359 --> 00:39:48,000
when we were watching the play

877
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,680
at Yuanjing Pavilion.

878
00:39:50,759 --> 00:39:52,479
Cheng Lang's grandma and I

879
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,479
hail from the same clan.

880
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,879
When we were young,

881
00:39:55,959 --> 00:39:57,279
we were very close.

882
00:39:57,439 --> 00:39:58,919
Then, she married far away,

883
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,680
and we lost touch.

884
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:04,520
I wonder why this Cheng Lang

885
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:07,000
has suddenly come to visit.

886
00:40:19,319 --> 00:40:20,680
Young Master Cheng,

887
00:40:20,759 --> 00:40:23,799
your grandma and I are
distant relatives from the same clan.

888
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,439
So there's no need

889
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:27,120
to be so formal.

890
00:40:27,319 --> 00:40:29,000
We're all family here.

891
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:30,640
These are my four granddaughters.

892
00:40:30,759 --> 00:40:32,759
They're all younger than you.

893
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,680
Why don't you get to know them?

894
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,919
Pleased to make your acquaintance.

895
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,600
My grandma often speaks fondly
of you, Old Madam Luo.

896
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,560
When she heard

897
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,959
of your illness,

898
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,560
she grew quite anxious.

899
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,759
However, due to her age,

900
00:40:57,959 --> 00:40:59,439
it was difficult for her to travel.

901
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,319
Though I've come

902
00:41:00,439 --> 00:41:02,040
to Luo's Residence to study,

903
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,520
my primary purpose was

904
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:04,799
to visit you on her behalf.

905
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,200
Oh,

906
00:41:07,319 --> 00:41:09,200
she really shouldn't have
worried so much.

907
00:41:09,319 --> 00:41:10,359
I've already

908
00:41:10,439 --> 00:41:11,680
recovered,

909
00:41:11,759 --> 00:41:12,759
thanks

910
00:41:12,799 --> 00:41:14,959
to my granddaughter Yining.

911
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:17,520
She sought treatment for me

912
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,640
and made sure I drank my medicine

913
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,919
every day.

914
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:29,560
The paper-cut screen

915
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,240
in your room

916
00:41:31,399 --> 00:41:32,799
is exquisite.

917
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:36,040
Surely it must be the work of a master.

918
00:41:36,839 --> 00:41:38,720
This fine work was made

919
00:41:38,839 --> 00:41:40,919
by my youngest granddaughter too.

920
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,439
She's always loved paper-cutting.

921
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:46,479
Seventh Lady has skilled hands indeed.

922
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,520
My uncle also enjoys paper cutting.

923
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,560
It's just

924
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:50,680
a little hobby of mine.

925
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,600
Nothing worthy of praise.

926
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:58,799
I've met

927
00:41:58,879 --> 00:42:01,000
First Lady before.

928
00:42:06,279 --> 00:42:07,759
We crossed paths briefly

929
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:09,799
at Yuanjing Pavilion.

930
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,279
Young Master Cheng,

931
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:14,160
your grandma and I
shared many memories

932
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,160
growing up together.

933
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:18,359
It feels like it was only yesterday,

934
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:22,240
but now our hair
has turned white with age.

935
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,560
Now,

936
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,680
you all are the age we were back then.

937
00:42:27,776 --> 00:42:28,520
But now you have us,

938
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,759
Grandma.

939
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:30,279
Right?

940
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:31,680
Right.

941
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:34,040
It is my blessing.

942
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:35,919
Young Master Cheng,

943
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,000
you've traveled a long way to be here.

944
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,799
Why not stay with us

945
00:42:40,839 --> 00:42:42,200
for a while?

946
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,560
As you wish, Old Madam Luo.

947
00:43:04,742 --> 00:43:10,622
♪It's complicated but I'm not afraid♪

948
00:43:11,645 --> 00:43:17,981
♪There's light in my heart♪

949
00:43:17,982 --> 00:43:21,622
♪Following the river of time♪

950
00:43:21,627 --> 00:43:25,141
♪I dive into the whirlpool♪

951
00:43:25,142 --> 00:43:26,822
