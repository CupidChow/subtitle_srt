4
00:03:14,603 --> 00:03:15,883
I... I told you.

5
00:03:18,163 --> 00:03:19,323
I'll give you that thing.

6
00:04:03,872 --> 00:04:04,640
Vice Minister Luo.

7
00:04:08,163 --> 00:04:10,643
Luo Shenyuan, you killed the criminal
without permission.

8
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:12,203
Take him down.

9
00:04:12,203 --> 00:04:12,923
Marquis Lu,

10
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,240
this may be a misunderstanding.

11
00:04:14,404 --> 00:04:15,524
Wang was too aggressive.

12
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:17,564
Perhaps Vice Minister Luo had no choice.

13
00:04:17,564 --> 00:04:18,883
Wang Yuan is a criminal.

14
00:04:19,364 --> 00:04:20,643
Before a verdict is made,

15
00:04:20,643 --> 00:04:21,323
no one

16
00:04:21,843 --> 00:04:22,843
can execute him.

17
00:04:22,976 --> 00:04:24,190
It's unusual that the Imperial

18
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,616
Court of Judicial lost a criminal.

19
00:04:25,648 --> 00:04:27,480
Plus, Luo Shenyuan, you killed him.

20
00:04:28,244 --> 00:04:29,484
Do you actually have a motive?

21
00:04:29,484 --> 00:04:31,244
I think you're the one with a motive.

22
00:04:35,403 --> 00:04:36,203
Vice Minister Luo,

23
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:37,763
everyone saw it.

24
00:04:38,164 --> 00:04:39,403
You killed him.

25
00:04:41,763 --> 00:04:43,959
You need to give everyone
a proper explanation.

26
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,760
I'm Vice Minister
of Imperial Court of Judicial.

27
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:46,720
The Imperial Guards

28
00:04:46,724 --> 00:04:48,684
have no right to detain me.

29
00:04:48,684 --> 00:04:50,724
I'll personally report this
to His Majesty.

30
00:04:51,523 --> 00:04:53,523
I'll find out

31
00:04:53,924 --> 00:04:55,564
who helped Wang Yuan escape.

32
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:03,872
Your Lordship,

33
00:05:03,872 --> 00:05:05,290
a fire broke out
on the northwest side

34
00:05:05,296 --> 00:05:06,540
of the residence due to fireworks.

35
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,130
The fire appears
to be spreading further.

36
00:05:08,144 --> 00:05:08,920
Northwest side?

37
00:05:08,924 --> 00:05:09,283
Yes.

38
00:05:12,564 --> 00:05:14,124
Isn't the Luo's Residence around there?

39
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:24,004
Luo Shenyuan

40
00:05:24,484 --> 00:05:25,523
fled out of fear of guilt.

41
00:05:26,044 --> 00:05:26,643
Give chase.

42
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,520
Go after him.

43
00:05:35,843 --> 00:05:37,283
Butler Bai, put out the fire!

44
00:05:37,283 --> 00:05:37,804
Yes.

45
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:38,403
Hurry!

46
00:05:38,403 --> 00:05:38,963
All right.

47
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:39,564
Yining...

48
00:06:18,843 --> 00:06:19,643
Old Madam.

49
00:06:19,643 --> 00:06:20,319
Mother.

50
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,180
- Old Madam.
- Grandma.

51
00:06:21,184 --> 00:06:22,120
Quick! Rui Xiang!

52
00:06:22,124 --> 00:06:22,763
Be quick.

53
00:06:24,044 --> 00:06:24,843
Let's go.

54
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:44,323
Take care of Grandma.

55
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:45,244
I'll be there soon.

56
00:06:59,643 --> 00:07:00,804
What has happened?

57
00:07:01,924 --> 00:07:02,763
Why did this happen?

58
00:07:04,083 --> 00:07:05,564
For some reason,

59
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,320
the fireworks storage
exploded last night

60
00:07:09,504 --> 00:07:11,344
and burned down
the entire Haitang Abode.

61
00:07:12,283 --> 00:07:13,124
Where's Yining?

62
00:07:15,484 --> 00:07:16,203
Where is she?

63
00:07:19,684 --> 00:07:22,604
Everyone in the abode is here.

64
00:07:36,244 --> 00:07:38,883
This is the bracelet I gave her.

65
00:07:40,883 --> 00:07:41,924
I put it on for her

66
00:07:41,924 --> 00:07:44,083
myself.

67
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:48,083
My fine granddaughter

68
00:07:48,244 --> 00:07:50,484
just married into your family,

69
00:07:50,684 --> 00:07:52,763
and now she's become a burned body.

70
00:07:53,323 --> 00:07:53,963
You!

71
00:07:53,963 --> 00:07:54,323
Grandma.

72
00:07:54,323 --> 00:07:54,843
Old Madam Wei.

73
00:07:54,843 --> 00:07:55,164
Grandma.

74
00:07:55,164 --> 00:07:56,044
Please calm down!

75
00:07:56,044 --> 00:07:58,244
How will you explain this to me?

76
00:07:58,244 --> 00:07:58,643
Grandma.

77
00:07:58,643 --> 00:07:59,443
Where is Luo Shenyuan?

78
00:07:59,443 --> 00:08:00,283
Where is he?

79
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:11,643
Where did you go

80
00:08:12,244 --> 00:08:13,244
on your wedding night?

81
00:08:19,044 --> 00:08:19,843
Duke Ying,

82
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:21,044
last night,

83
00:08:22,044 --> 00:08:23,843
Shenyuan went out
for some official matters.

84
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,720
I don't care what the affairs are.

85
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,320
Please calm down.

86
00:08:29,323 --> 00:08:30,164
On your wedding night,

87
00:08:30,164 --> 00:08:31,203
you let my daughter

88
00:08:31,203 --> 00:08:32,643
suffer this tragic fate alone.

89
00:08:32,683 --> 00:08:34,124
How are you going to explain this to me?

90
00:08:34,124 --> 00:08:35,403
Please calm down.

91
00:08:35,403 --> 00:08:36,043
Your Lordship.

92
00:08:36,043 --> 00:08:37,484
Don't blame Shenyuan for that.

93
00:08:37,484 --> 00:08:38,324
Please calm down.

94
00:08:39,204 --> 00:08:40,163
Calm down.

95
00:08:49,084 --> 00:08:49,763
You!

96
00:08:50,043 --> 00:08:50,724
Please calm down.

97
00:08:50,883 --> 00:08:51,563
Please calm down.

98
00:08:51,563 --> 00:08:52,163
Calm down.

99
00:08:53,763 --> 00:08:54,364
Calm down.

100
00:08:54,604 --> 00:08:55,364
Father.

101
00:08:55,364 --> 00:08:55,724
Hurry!

102
00:08:55,724 --> 00:08:57,084
Send for a physician!

103
00:08:57,084 --> 00:08:57,604
Now!

104
00:08:57,604 --> 00:08:58,923
What has happened?

105
00:09:09,043 --> 00:09:09,844
Young Master,

106
00:09:10,043 --> 00:09:11,403
please at least eat something.

107
00:09:11,403 --> 00:09:12,604
I can't eat.

108
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,552
The entire Luo's Residence
has already been searched.

109
00:09:15,568 --> 00:09:16,840
Lu Jiaxue won't find you here.

110
00:09:18,283 --> 00:09:20,283
But where is Yining?

111
00:09:20,964 --> 00:09:21,763
Young Master,

112
00:09:22,484 --> 00:09:23,444
please don't be too upset.

113
00:09:24,444 --> 00:09:25,244
Even Old Madam Wei

114
00:09:25,244 --> 00:09:26,204
confirmed it...

115
00:09:28,163 --> 00:09:29,364
That wasn't Yining.

116
00:09:29,484 --> 00:09:30,324
Young Master,

117
00:09:31,403 --> 00:09:32,803
I know you're miserable.

118
00:09:32,803 --> 00:09:34,043
I can't accept that either.

119
00:09:35,244 --> 00:09:36,403
But no one in the Haitang Abode

120
00:09:36,403 --> 00:09:37,923
managed to escape the fire.

121
00:09:38,124 --> 00:09:38,844
The abode

122
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:40,563
was burned to the ground

123
00:09:41,124 --> 00:09:42,683
with only that amount of fireworks?

124
00:09:43,484 --> 00:09:45,324
What... What is this about?

125
00:09:45,324 --> 00:09:46,043
This is obviously

126
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:47,683
Lu Jiaxue's scheme.

127
00:09:47,883 --> 00:09:49,124
Him again?

128
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:56,364
Lu Jiaxue helped Wang Yuan escape

129
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,840
and lured me into capturing him.

130
00:09:57,964 --> 00:09:59,683
Then, he staged a scene
to push Wang Yuan

131
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:01,084
toward my sword.

132
00:10:01,283 --> 00:10:02,359
While I was away,

133
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,360
he set off the fireworks

134
00:10:03,408 --> 00:10:04,960
and started a fire to cover it up.

135
00:10:04,964 --> 00:10:06,964
It's all because he wants
to take Yining away

136
00:10:07,264 --> 00:10:08,816
before he leaves for a foreign post.

137
00:10:08,883 --> 00:10:11,043
He's simply insane.

138
00:10:12,604 --> 00:10:13,683
Lu Jiaxue's obsession

139
00:10:14,204 --> 00:10:15,883
with Yining runs too deep.

140
00:10:16,484 --> 00:10:18,124
I should've foreseen this.

141
00:10:18,163 --> 00:10:19,964
Then why did he accuse you
of killing Wang Yuan

142
00:10:20,043 --> 00:10:21,683
and say you fled out of guilt?

143
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:24,923
He wants to drive me to a dead end.

144
00:10:25,152 --> 00:10:26,400
Leastways, he wants to prevent me

145
00:10:26,403 --> 00:10:27,883
from rescuing Yining.

146
00:10:27,968 --> 00:10:29,568
That's why I had to run away last night.

147
00:10:31,204 --> 00:10:32,324
If it were a day or two late,

148
00:10:32,656 --> 00:10:34,240
the consequences would be unimaginable.

149
00:10:35,043 --> 00:10:36,324
Besides, that body

150
00:10:37,324 --> 00:10:38,484
supports my theory

151
00:10:38,484 --> 00:10:39,683
that Yining's still alive.

152
00:10:40,484 --> 00:10:43,043
Yining wears her bracelet
on her left hand,

153
00:10:44,403 --> 00:10:46,763
but the body has it on the right.

154
00:10:48,124 --> 00:10:48,923
Where would Lu Jiaxue

155
00:10:48,923 --> 00:10:49,883
hide her?

156
00:10:50,484 --> 00:10:51,883
Should we send Qi An to investigate?

157
00:10:51,883 --> 00:10:52,683
Not yet.

158
00:10:54,283 --> 00:10:55,643
He cares about Yining.

159
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:57,523
He won't hurt her.

160
00:10:57,683 --> 00:10:59,244
Instead, if he can't find me,

161
00:10:59,683 --> 00:11:01,563
he'll target Longquan Trading House.

162
00:11:01,964 --> 00:11:02,964
Inform Qi An

163
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,560
to tell all our people to hide for now.

164
00:11:04,608 --> 00:11:05,760
What about you, Young Master?

165
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,864
Before I could find Yining,

166
00:11:07,403 --> 00:11:08,803
I need something

167
00:11:08,803 --> 00:11:09,484
crucial

168
00:11:09,484 --> 00:11:10,724
to Lu Jiaxue's life.

169
00:11:13,604 --> 00:11:14,484
What did you say?

170
00:11:14,844 --> 00:11:15,683
No?

171
00:11:15,923 --> 00:11:16,724
Your Lordship,

172
00:11:16,724 --> 00:11:17,484
Wang Yuan's servant

173
00:11:17,484 --> 00:11:18,763
didn't show up.

174
00:11:18,763 --> 00:11:20,484
Did Wang Yuan fool us,

175
00:11:20,484 --> 00:11:21,923
or did someone get to him ahead of us?

176
00:11:37,883 --> 00:11:39,964
Luo Shenyuan!

177
00:11:44,484 --> 00:11:45,763
Wang Yuan must've given

178
00:11:46,004 --> 00:11:47,683
the agreement to Luo Shenyuan.

179
00:11:49,124 --> 00:11:50,523
Take your men

180
00:11:51,364 --> 00:11:53,124
to search for Luo Shenyuan.

181
00:11:53,923 --> 00:11:54,283
Now.

182
00:11:54,604 --> 00:11:54,923
Yes.

183
00:11:55,683 --> 00:11:56,163
Hold on.

184
00:11:58,043 --> 00:11:58,883
How's the condition

185
00:11:59,444 --> 00:12:00,844
at Duke Ying's Residence?

186
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,800
Although Duke Ying claims

187
00:12:01,803 --> 00:12:03,563
he doesn't believe Wei Yining has died,

188
00:12:03,883 --> 00:12:05,324
he's been bedridden since his return.

189
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,344
An imperial physician
came to check on him

190
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,810
and diagnosed it as a sudden heartache.

191
00:12:08,816 --> 00:12:10,760
As of now, the residence is closed.

192
00:12:11,004 --> 00:12:12,163
No one can meet with Duke Ying.

193
00:12:12,604 --> 00:12:13,204
And her.

194
00:12:14,043 --> 00:12:15,364
How's she?

195
00:12:15,604 --> 00:12:16,444
She's awake

196
00:12:17,163 --> 00:12:18,444
but hasn't spoken

197
00:12:18,643 --> 00:12:19,523
or eaten.

198
00:12:20,923 --> 00:12:21,724
All right.

199
00:12:22,124 --> 00:12:22,683
Go now.

200
00:12:22,923 --> 00:12:23,484
Yes.

201
00:13:02,844 --> 00:13:03,604
Madam,

202
00:13:03,604 --> 00:13:05,204
please eat something.

203
00:13:05,204 --> 00:13:06,523
If you still refuse to eat,

204
00:13:06,683 --> 00:13:08,683
His Lordship will beat me to death.

205
00:13:09,683 --> 00:13:11,444
He locked me up here.

206
00:13:11,643 --> 00:13:12,643
What does he want?

207
00:13:12,683 --> 00:13:14,084
I don't know.

208
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:15,084
His Lordship ordered me

209
00:13:15,084 --> 00:13:16,244
to serve you well.

210
00:13:16,244 --> 00:13:18,643
Shall I help you change first?

211
00:13:19,084 --> 00:13:20,124
Leave me.

212
00:13:20,604 --> 00:13:21,204
Yes.

213
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:23,643
Your Lordship.

214
00:13:28,163 --> 00:13:28,923
You're awake.

215
00:13:28,923 --> 00:13:30,124
Why didn't you eat anything?

216
00:13:37,163 --> 00:13:38,084
You'll catch a cold.

217
00:13:38,204 --> 00:13:39,283
Don't touch me!

218
00:13:41,563 --> 00:13:43,043
Why are you locking me up here?

219
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:00,763
Eat something first.

220
00:14:01,724 --> 00:14:02,163
Be good.

221
00:14:06,964 --> 00:14:07,763
Otherwise,

222
00:14:09,643 --> 00:14:11,124
I won't tell you anything.

223
00:14:25,204 --> 00:14:26,964
(I must endure
until I meet Third Brother.)

224
00:14:52,563 --> 00:14:54,124
Why are you showing me all this?

225
00:14:54,563 --> 00:14:55,364
Yining,

226
00:14:55,683 --> 00:14:56,724
this place

227
00:14:57,763 --> 00:14:58,964
keeps all of our memories.

228
00:14:59,324 --> 00:15:01,683
Sadly, we have to leave this place

229
00:15:02,084 --> 00:15:03,563
as we just reunited.

230
00:15:04,004 --> 00:15:05,043
But don't worry.

231
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:06,683
If you want,

232
00:15:07,244 --> 00:15:08,084
I'll bring all of them

233
00:15:08,484 --> 00:15:09,923
with us.

234
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:11,324
Where are you taking me to?

235
00:15:13,683 --> 00:15:15,523
I'm going to be stationed at the border,

236
00:15:15,923 --> 00:15:17,204
so I'm taking you with me.

237
00:15:17,204 --> 00:15:18,124
Never.

238
00:15:19,643 --> 00:15:21,043
I've already married my third brother.

239
00:15:21,283 --> 00:15:22,683
I won't leave with you.

240
00:15:26,683 --> 00:15:28,163
I'm more than patient with you.

241
00:15:28,964 --> 00:15:30,124
I can wait for you.

242
00:15:31,683 --> 00:15:32,923
Don't try

243
00:15:33,883 --> 00:15:35,643
to get out of this place.

244
00:15:36,043 --> 00:15:37,523
My guards have surrounded this place.

245
00:15:38,043 --> 00:15:39,484
Not even a fly

246
00:15:40,084 --> 00:15:41,163

00:15:43,683 --> 00:15:45,324
how's Third Brother now?

249
00:15:45,563 --> 00:15:47,364
He killed a criminal without permission

250
00:15:47,444 --> 00:15:48,844
and fled out of guilt.

251
00:15:49,084 --> 00:15:50,324
He did it for the greater good,

252
00:15:50,763 --> 00:15:51,959
but you framed him

253
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,296
out of your own selfishness.

254

I'm satisfied.

383
00:24:20,655 --> 00:24:26,311
♪Love is a voyage with you by my side♪

384
00:24:27,211 --> 00:24:33,440
♪The dust eventually settles♪

385
00:24:36,363 --> 00:24:37,164
Young Lady.

386
00:24:37,924 --> 00:24:38,964
Are you all right?

387
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:40,523
We're good.

388
00:24:40,803 --> 00:24:42,039
Though we were detained

389
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:42,960
by Lu Jiaxue's men,

390
00:24:42,976 --> 00:24:44,120
they didn't hurt us.

391
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:44,960
Young Lady,

392
00:24:44,992 --> 00:24:46,400
we were so worried about you.

393
00:24:46,563 --> 00:24:48,763
As long as you're fine.

394
00:24:49,083 --> 00:24:49,884
Young Lady,

395
00:24:50,123 --> 00:24:52,523
is Lu Jiaxue really dead?

396
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:08,603
(Jiaxue)
Uncle,

397
00:25:09,484 --> 00:25:10,323
I wanted

398
00:25:11,644 --> 00:25:13,043
to place your memorial tablet

399
00:25:13,104 --> 00:25:15,584
(Memorial Tablet of Uncle,)
in the marriage chamber you prepared,

400
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,160
(Marquis Lu Jiaxue)
but your residence has been seized.

401
00:25:19,724 --> 00:25:20,684
I could only

402
00:25:21,004 --> 00:25:22,484
put it here.

403
00:25:23,444 --> 00:25:24,644
But I believe

404
00:25:25,603 --> 00:25:27,204
you would prefer to stay here.

405
00:25:28,204 --> 00:25:29,283
After all, this place

406
00:25:29,283 --> 00:25:30,523
holds your sweetest memories.

407
00:25:32,204 --> 00:25:33,964
You were successful in your life.

408
00:25:34,964 --> 00:25:35,763
However,

409
00:25:37,404 --> 00:25:39,244
you were too obsessed with love.

410
00:25:40,283 --> 00:25:41,404
May you

411
00:25:43,763 --> 00:25:45,083
be a simple and happy person

412
00:25:45,763 --> 00:25:47,323
in your next life.

413
00:25:47,998 --> 00:25:50,053
(Marquis Lu Jiaxue)

414
00:25:50,256 --> 00:25:52,592
(Duke Ying's Residence)

415
00:25:52,763 --> 00:25:53,803
Mercifully,

416
00:25:54,123 --> 00:25:56,043
Yining didn't get hurt.

417
00:25:56,444 --> 00:25:58,323
She was just shocked.

418
00:25:58,843 --> 00:26:00,164
Lu Jiaxue

419
00:26:00,164 --> 00:26:01,444
wasn't completely cruel.

420
00:26:01,924 --> 00:26:03,843
He didn't let Yining
take the arrow for him.

421
00:26:04,204 --> 00:26:05,404
I had Cheng Lang

422
00:26:05,404 --> 00:26:07,244
bury his body properly.

423
00:26:10,924 --> 00:26:12,603
His father and I were friends,

424
00:26:13,004 --> 00:26:15,123
and I watched him grow.

425
00:26:16,523 --> 00:26:17,803
I just didn't expect...

426
00:26:19,123 --> 00:26:19,763
By the way,

427
00:26:20,323 --> 00:26:21,763
Wang Yuan

428
00:26:22,123 --> 00:26:23,724
refused to hand over the agreement.

429
00:26:23,884 --> 00:26:26,123
How did you get it?

430
00:26:26,224 --> 00:26:26,920
Wang Yuan knew

431
00:26:26,924 --> 00:26:28,244
he couldn't rely on Lu Jiaxue,

432
00:26:28,843 --> 00:26:30,204
so he sent it to me

433
00:26:30,803 --> 00:26:31,843
on the day of my wedding.

434
00:26:36,043 --> 00:26:37,724
The wedding gift.

435
00:26:38,523 --> 00:26:39,164
Butler Bai,

436
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:39,724
there's a gift

437
00:26:39,724 --> 00:26:40,724
without a name card.

438
00:26:40,724 --> 00:26:42,484
We don't know who the sender is.

439
00:26:42,964 --> 00:26:43,763
Young Master,

440
00:26:43,843 --> 00:26:44,964
I checked with Butler Bai.

441
00:26:45,024 --> 00:26:46,112
On the day of your wedding,

442
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,440
only this gift

443
00:26:47,444 --> 00:26:48,684
came without a name card.

444
00:26:52,792 --> 00:26:56,120
(Lu Jiaxue)

445
00:26:58,964 --> 00:27:01,684
Wang Yuan

446
00:27:02,884 --> 00:27:04,123
has made his bed.

447
00:27:08,803 --> 00:27:10,123
I've married my daughter

448
00:27:10,123 --> 00:27:11,164
to you.

449
00:27:11,363 --> 00:27:13,684
You must make sure to protect her
for me

450
00:27:14,363 --> 00:27:15,083
and keep her out

451
00:27:15,083 --> 00:27:16,363
of harm's way.

452
00:27:17,872 --> 00:27:19,080
Don't worry, Father-in-law.

453
00:27:19,444 --> 00:27:21,684
I'll treat her wholeheartedly.

454
00:27:37,363 --> 00:27:38,684
Let's continue the ceremony

455
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:40,164

when you woke up?

I need to get up to greet them.

494
00:30:42,004 --> 00:30:43,323
Let's sleep for a while more.

495
00:30:45,843 --> 00:30:47,123
We'll be late.

496
00:30:47,404 --> 00:30:49,043
They won't mind

497
00:30:49,043 --> 00:30:50,083
about these formalities.

498
00:31:12,528 --> 00:31:14,448
- Greetings, Grandma.
- Greetings, Grandma.

499
00:31:16,004 --> 00:31:17,763
Get up.

- Thank you, Grandma.
- Thank you, Grandma.

501
00:31:25,603 --> 00:31:27,603
You should've slept a bit longer.

502
00:31:27,603 --> 00:31:28,884
Why are you in a hurry

503
00:31:28,884 --> 00:31:30,644
to come greet me?

504
00:31:30,684 --> 00:31:31,603
That won't do.

505
00:31:31,603 --> 00:31:32,563
We mustn't skip

506
00:31:32,563 --> 00:31:33,843
these formalities.

507
00:31:34,083 --> 00:31:34,803
From now on,

508
00:31:34,803 --> 00:31:36,763
I'll come and greet you every day.

- Thank you, Grandma.
- Thank you, Grandma.

512
00:31:54,523 --> 00:31:55,323
Come here.

513
00:31:57,684 --> 00:31:58,803
Thankfully,

514
00:31:58,803 --> 00:32:00,404
you all came back safe and sound.

515
00:32:00,404 --> 00:32:01,924
My mind is at ease now.

516
00:32:02,363 --> 00:32:03,323
Look,

517
00:32:03,363 --> 00:32:04,964
after all this time,

518
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:06,523
you're back
in the Luo's Residence again.

519
00:32:06,523 --> 00:32:08,083
I'm truly elated.

520
00:32:08,924 --> 00:32:10,763
This time is different, Grandma.

521
00:32:10,763 --> 00:32:11,964
You should call me

522
00:32:11,964 --> 00:32:13,444
granddaughter-in-law.

523
00:32:14,484 --> 00:32:15,484
Granddaughter-in-law.

524
00:32:16,523 --> 00:32:18,404
Sure, my granddaughter-in-law.

525
00:32:18,763 --> 00:32:20,644
I've already rebuilt

526
00:32:20,644 --> 00:32:22,283
the Haitang Abode for you.

527
00:32:22,323 --> 00:32:23,964
If you'd like to stay there for a while,

528
00:32:23,964 --> 00:32:25,244
you can move there.

529
00:32:25,563 --> 00:32:26,043
Sure.

530
00:32:26,484 --> 00:32:28,763
If I have an argument
with Third Brother,

531
00:32:28,763 --> 00:32:30,404
I'll move in there.

532
00:32:32,404 --> 00:32:34,204
If he bullies you,

533
00:32:34,204 --> 00:32:35,884
I'll punish him.

534
00:32:36,763 --> 00:32:38,363
Grandma, I heard that.

535
00:32:40,484 --> 00:32:41,523
I wouldn't dare.

536
00:32:42,684 --> 00:32:43,484
All right.

537
00:32:43,484 --> 00:32:45,004
Hurry and go greet

538
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:45,724
your parents.

539
00:32:46,323 --> 00:32:48,083
They're waiting for you.

540
00:32:48,363 --> 00:32:49,684
- Yes, Grandma.
- Yes, Grandma.

541
00:32:58,528 --> 00:33:01,456
- Greetings, Father and Mother.
- Greetings, Father and Mother.

542
00:33:08,684 --> 00:33:09,924
We're late.

543
00:33:09,924 --> 00:33:11,644
Please forgive us.

544
00:33:11,803 --> 00:33:12,763
Get up.

545
00:33:13,444 --> 00:33:14,363
We're family.

546
00:33:14,363 --> 00:33:15,964
There's no need for that.

547
00:33:16,363 --> 00:33:17,164
Shenyuan and you

548
00:33:17,164 --> 00:33:19,043
just finished the ceremony yesterday.

549
00:33:19,763 --> 00:33:20,523
Naturally,

550
00:33:20,523 --> 00:33:21,964
you should spend more time together.

551
00:33:22,283 --> 00:33:23,083
Exactly.

552
00:33:23,404 --> 00:33:25,043
Since you're married,

553
00:33:25,043 --> 00:33:26,004
you're going

554
00:33:26,244 --> 00:33:27,603
to give birth to children

555
00:33:27,603 --> 00:33:29,204
for the Luo Family.

556
00:33:29,763 --> 00:33:31,043
They just got married.

557
00:33:31,244 --> 00:33:32,523
What's the hurry?

558
00:33:33,204 --> 00:33:34,123
This young couple

559
00:33:34,123 --> 00:33:35,603
should spend more time

560
00:33:35,603 --> 00:33:37,004
with each other now.

561
00:33:39,603 --> 00:33:40,763
Well, all right.

562
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,016
I won't say anything more.

563
00:33:42,064 --> 00:33:42,928
You go ahead.

564
00:33:43,296 --> 00:33:44,560
I won't say anything either.

565
00:33:44,924 --> 00:33:45,803
Wait, you didn't

566
00:33:46,144 --> 00:33:47,360
let me talk just now, did you?

567
00:33:47,363 --> 00:33:48,164
Just say it

568
00:33:48,164 --> 00:33:48,964
if you want to.

569
00:33:48,964 --> 00:33:50,123
Didn't you just stop me?

570
00:33:50,123 --> 00:33:51,484
I didn't.

571
00:33:51,484 --> 00:33:52,519
You think I interrupted you,

572
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:53,392
and you're not happy,

573
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,120
so I won't talk.

574
00:33:54,123 --> 00:33:54,964
What did I say?

575
00:33:54,964 --> 00:33:56,164
I didn't stop you.

576
00:33:56,164 --> 00:33:57,083
I won't talk.

577
00:33:57,456 --> 00:33:58,360
I didn't mean that.

578
00:33:58,363 --> 00:33:59,123
Father, Mother...

579
00:33:59,363 --> 00:33:59,763
Well...

580
00:34:01,043 --> 00:34:03,043
We'll go back and tidy up.

581
00:34:03,204 --> 00:34:03,763
You may go.

582
00:34:04,064 --> 00:34:04,400
Go ahead.

583
00:34:04,404 --> 00:34:05,164
Just continue

584
00:34:05,164 --> 00:34:06,004
what you want to say.

585
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:07,279
You think I interrupted you,

586
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:07,952
so you're unhappy.

587
00:34:07,952 --> 00:34:08,960
No, I'm not.

588
00:34:09,284 --> 00:34:10,004
What's wrong

589
00:34:10,004 --> 00:34:10,764
with you?

590
00:34:10,764 --> 00:34:11,563
Listen,

591
00:34:11,683 --> 00:34:12,884
you interrupted me.

592
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:13,844
I didn't interrupt you.

593
00:34:13,856 --> 00:34:14,940
How did you not interrupt me?

594
00:34:14,944 --> 00:34:16,430
Just now, you said...

595
00:34:27,804 --> 00:34:28,603
Third Brother.

596
00:34:34,603 --> 00:34:35,603
We're married now.

597
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,232
Why are you still calling me that?

598
00:34:37,296 --> 00:34:38,672
What should I call you?

599
00:34:38,688 --> 00:34:39,840
You tell me.

600
00:34:41,964 --> 00:34:42,764
My dear.

601
00:34:43,964 --> 00:34:44,764
My dear.

602
00:34:45,284 --> 00:34:46,083
My dear.

603
00:34:49,563 --> 00:34:50,723
Why are you shy?

604
00:35:07,723 --> 00:35:10,364
My dear, stop pretending.

605
00:35:12,643 --> 00:35:14,123
We're like old couples.

606
00:35:14,272 --> 00:35:16,208
Why do you still blush
when I call you "my dear"?

607
00:35:16,304 --> 00:35:17,680
We're not like old couples.

608
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:19,964
We just got married.

609
00:35:24,123 --> 00:35:25,484
I think Mother is right.

610
00:35:25,924 --> 00:35:27,043
What did she say?

611
00:35:29,083 --> 00:35:30,243
Since we just got married,

612
00:35:30,924 --> 00:35:31,643
we should

613
00:35:31,643 --> 00:35:33,404
spend more time together.

614
00:35:33,964 --> 00:35:35,563
We don't need to have children now.

615
00:35:38,884 --> 00:35:39,683
Third Brother.

616
00:35:42,163 --> 00:35:43,004
My dear,

617
00:35:44,683 --> 00:35:47,043
if we have children in the future,

618
00:35:47,243 --> 00:35:48,284
would you

619
00:35:48,284 --> 00:35:50,083
get jealous of them?

620
00:35:52,203 --> 00:35:53,563
That's a good question.

621
00:35:54,404 --> 00:35:55,764
If it's a girl

622
00:35:56,004 --> 00:35:57,163
like you,

623
00:35:57,964 --> 00:35:58,444
maybe.

624
00:35:59,404 --> 00:36:00,364
But if it's a boy,

625
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,424
forget it.

626
00:36:10,103 --> 00:36:13,720
(A year later)

627
00:36:34,884 --> 00:36:35,844
You must be tired.

628
00:36:37,243 --> 00:36:39,203
I'm a bit tired,

629
00:36:40,243 --> 00:36:41,563
but when I see you

630
00:36:42,123 --> 00:36:43,284
and our son,

631
00:36:43,563 --> 00:36:44,723
I feel better.

632
00:37:04,924 --> 00:37:06,364
Since we had Bao,

633
00:37:06,964 --> 00:37:09,123
you don't look at me

634
00:37:09,284 --> 00:37:10,964
as much as you did before.

635
00:37:11,364 --> 00:37:13,324
Are you really jealous of your son?

636
00:37:16,004 --> 00:37:17,484
Look at this little boy.

637
00:37:17,924 --> 00:37:19,083
He must take after you.

638
00:37:19,123 --> 00:37:19,924
Fine-looking.

639
00:37:20,523 --> 00:37:21,643
But in the future,

640
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:23,040
he should be like me,

641
00:37:23,764 --> 00:37:25,924
knowledgeable, a skilled fighter,
and a businessman.

642
00:37:25,924 --> 00:37:27,123
He can be anything,

643
00:37:27,643 --> 00:37:29,123
as long as we are

644
00:37:29,563 --> 00:37:31,563
healthy and safe.

645
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,203
Well said.

646
00:37:33,884 --> 00:37:36,243
As long as we're together.

647
00:37:38,764 --> 00:37:41,404
When we're together,
there are no worries,

648
00:37:42,243 --> 00:37:43,444
and we're at peace.

649
00:38:06,544 --> 00:38:07,760
(Yanrong Pavilion)
This Hundred

650
00:38:07,764 --> 00:38:09,199
Fragrances Oil is our latest product.

651
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,216
It's suitable for ladies
who've recently given birth.

652
00:38:11,248 --> 00:38:12,440
If you apply it every day,

653
00:38:12,444 --> 00:38:13,964
your skin will become smoother
than tofu.

654
00:38:13,964 --> 00:38:15,563
The effect is indeed miraculous.

655
00:38:16,123 --> 00:38:17,924
Princess Qingcheng has tried it.

656
00:38:17,924 --> 00:38:19,004
This is absolutely authentic.

657
00:38:19,203 --> 00:38:20,163
Really?

658
00:38:20,163 --> 00:38:21,123
Ladies,

659
00:38:21,804 --> 00:38:23,123
we have a celebration at home,

660
00:38:23,243 --> 00:38:24,243
so we're offering a deal.

661
00:38:24,243 --> 00:38:25,123
Buy one, get one free.

662
00:38:25,123 --> 00:38:26,203
Now or never.

663
00:38:27,444 --> 00:38:28,043
I want it!

664
00:38:29,284 --> 00:38:29,723
Give me one.

665
00:38:29,723 --> 00:38:30,484
No rush.

666
00:38:30,496 --> 00:38:31,280
Everyone will get it.

667
00:38:31,603 --> 00:38:31,924
Come.

668
00:38:31,924 --> 00:38:32,324
Don't push.

669
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:32,760
Here.

670
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,488
I came here first.

671
00:38:33,523 --> 00:38:34,083
Be careful.

672
00:38:34,444 --> 00:38:35,719
I want two bottles.

673
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,208
Here you go.

674
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,000
I want two bottles.

675
00:38:37,004 --> 00:38:37,683
Here you go.

676
00:38:37,683 --> 00:38:38,243
Patience.

677
00:38:39,364 --> 00:38:41,123
My dear is more eloquent

678
00:38:41,364 --> 00:38:43,163
than I am now.

679
00:38:43,163 --> 00:38:44,639
Because you've influenced me.

680
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,568
You're eloquent.

681
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,520
I should speak well, too.

682
00:38:46,523 --> 00:38:47,764
My dear always speaks well.

683
00:38:47,764 --> 00:38:48,563
I'm to blame.

684
00:38:49,163 --> 00:38:50,804
I learned that from you.

685
00:38:50,804 --> 00:38:51,444
All right.

686
00:38:51,444 --> 00:38:52,123
I want one, too.

687
00:38:52,123 --> 00:38:52,844
It smells great.

688
00:38:52,844 --> 00:38:53,523
Take care, ladies.

689
00:38:54,444 --> 00:38:56,284
Take care.

690
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,544
Luckily, Yining has finally completed
her confinement.

691
00:38:58,544 --> 00:38:59,240
If not,

692
00:38:59,243 --> 00:39:00,964
I wouldn't be able to manage

693
00:39:01,043 --> 00:39:02,484
four shop branches on my own.

694
00:39:03,723 --> 00:39:04,723
It's almost time.

695
00:39:04,723 --> 00:39:05,884
We should head back.

696
00:39:05,924 --> 00:39:06,603
Right.

697
00:39:06,603 --> 00:39:07,844
We better not be late.

698
00:39:08,683 --> 00:39:09,284
Come,

699
00:39:10,364 --> 00:39:11,563
Yixiu and I will be leaving.

700
00:39:11,563 --> 00:39:12,844
Mind the shop.

701
00:39:12,844 --> 00:39:13,563
Yes.

702
00:39:13,964 --> 00:39:15,123
My dear, let's go.

703
00:39:15,764 --> 00:39:17,404
We forgot the birthday gift.

704
00:39:17,523 --> 00:39:18,324
I'll go get it.

705
00:39:18,404 --> 00:39:19,364
You're so clumsy.

706
00:39:19,404 --> 00:39:20,364
I'll go with you.

707
00:39:23,243 --> 00:39:24,043
My dear,

708
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,344
why are you still in the mood

709
00:39:25,376 --> 00:39:26,120
to drink tea here?

710
00:39:26,123 --> 00:39:27,884
Hurry and get changed.

711
00:39:29,364 --> 00:39:30,643
Isn't this

712
00:39:30,683 --> 00:39:32,364
just a family banquet?

713
00:39:32,964 --> 00:39:33,723
Come, Hairu.

714
00:39:33,723 --> 00:39:34,643
Let's have tea together.

715
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:36,444
Shenyuan and Yining

716
00:39:36,444 --> 00:39:37,964
don't want to have a grand feast.

717
00:39:37,964 --> 00:39:38,399
Still,

718
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,256
this is Bao's one-month-old
birthday celebration.

719
00:39:40,324 --> 00:39:41,563
You're his grandpa.

720
00:39:41,563 --> 00:39:43,004
You should take it seriously.

721
00:39:43,163 --> 00:39:44,723
How am I not serious about it?

722
00:39:45,203 --> 00:39:46,924
Bao is my eldest grandson.

723
00:39:47,203 --> 00:39:48,764
Needless to say,
I treasure him the most.

724
00:39:49,004 --> 00:39:50,004
Let me tell you a secret.

725
00:39:50,243 --> 00:39:51,484
I've built

726
00:39:51,523 --> 00:39:52,683
a study for him.

727
00:39:53,804 --> 00:39:54,959
Get up now. Someone, come.

728
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,220
Help Second Master change his clothes.

729
00:39:56,224 --> 00:39:56,960
Just one more sip.

730
00:39:56,964 --> 00:39:57,444
Quick.

731
00:39:57,804 --> 00:39:59,364
You've ruined my mood.

732
00:40:02,004 --> 00:40:03,043
Mr. Sun,

733
00:40:03,123 --> 00:40:04,804
Vice Minister Yang of Revenue,

734
00:40:04,964 --> 00:40:06,163
Earl Zhongqin,

735
00:40:06,163 --> 00:40:07,243
and some other families

736
00:40:07,243 --> 00:40:08,723
sent gifts over.

737
00:40:11,083 --> 00:40:13,324
I wanted to keep things low-key.

738
00:40:13,764 --> 00:40:14,683
Still,

739
00:40:14,683 --> 00:40:16,444
we've alerted them.

740
00:40:18,243 --> 00:40:19,203
Take all these gifts

741
00:40:19,523 --> 00:40:20,964
to the treasury.

742
00:40:21,243 --> 00:40:23,364
Record each of them clearly,

743
00:40:23,964 --> 00:40:25,364
so that we can return gifts later.

744
00:40:25,844 --> 00:40:26,404
Yes.

745
00:40:29,444 --> 00:40:31,603
Has this month's allowance
been distributed?

746
00:40:31,764 --> 00:40:32,764
Yes.

747
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:34,159
A few days ago,

748
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,080
Young Master Shan
and Young Master Xuan came back.

749
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:37,504
We've also distributed it to them.

750
00:40:37,584 --> 00:40:38,920
Very well.

751
00:40:39,563 --> 00:40:41,444
Butler Bai, you may go.

752
00:40:41,603 --> 00:40:42,123
Yes.

753
00:40:47,964 --> 00:40:48,643
Seventh Sister.

754
00:40:49,884 --> 00:40:51,243
First Sister, First Brother-in-law.

755
00:40:51,683 --> 00:40:52,563
Fifth Sister.

756
00:40:52,563 --> 00:40:53,643
You're all here.

757
00:40:53,964 --> 00:40:55,723
Today is Bao's one-month
birthday celebration.

758
00:40:55,804 --> 00:40:57,284
We can't miss out.

759
00:40:57,884 --> 00:40:59,284
Look at you.

760
00:40:59,404 --> 00:41:00,123
You're looking more

761
00:41:00,123 --> 00:41:01,643
like the lady owner of this residence.

762
00:41:02,224 --> 00:41:03,480
Where is it? Bring it here.

763
00:41:03,683 --> 00:41:04,764
Your first sister

764
00:41:04,924 --> 00:41:06,563
spent quite some time preparing this.

765
00:41:06,723 --> 00:41:07,643
Let me have a look.

766
00:41:13,083 --> 00:41:13,804
You can hang it

767
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:15,163
in the room.

768
00:41:15,404 --> 00:41:17,324
It's a blessing embroidery I made.

769
00:41:17,444 --> 00:41:18,839
May the boy be safe and peaceful

770
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,936
with boundless happiness.

771
00:41:20,203 --> 00:41:21,764
Thank you, First Sister.

772
00:41:22,004 --> 00:41:23,359
My husband couldn't make it

773
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,352
due to official duties.

774
00:41:24,368 --> 00:41:25,320
This is a small gift

775
00:41:25,324 --> 00:41:26,324
from both of us.

776
00:41:28,484 --> 00:41:30,123
What a delicate gold lock.

777
00:41:30,643 --> 00:41:31,884
This is an amulet.

778
00:41:32,123 --> 00:41:33,243
I hope both you and your son

779
00:41:33,243 --> 00:41:34,563
are safe.

780
00:41:35,444 --> 00:41:36,804
I also wish all of us

781
00:41:36,804 --> 00:41:38,603
to be harmonious and safe.

782
00:41:39,924 --> 00:41:41,083
Has my husband returned yet?

783
00:41:41,203 --> 00:41:42,324
Not yet.

784
00:41:42,324 --> 00:41:43,404
But he should be back

785
00:41:43,404 --> 00:41:45,004
by now.

786
00:41:45,563 --> 00:41:47,563
Let's go to the garden.

787
00:41:51,924 --> 00:41:52,723
I can't believe

788
00:41:52,723 --> 00:41:54,123
I'm an uncle now.

789
00:41:55,643 --> 00:41:56,203
Ting.

790
00:41:58,083 --> 00:41:58,364
Father.

791
00:41:58,643 --> 00:42:00,004
Now that you're an uncle,

792
00:42:00,004 --> 00:42:01,004
it means you're an adult

793
00:42:01,243 --> 00:42:02,324
and need to be more sensible.

794
00:42:03,324 --> 00:42:04,243
When I go home later,

795
00:42:04,243 --> 00:42:05,563
I will read one more book!

796
00:42:08,523 --> 00:42:09,964
This boy

797
00:42:09,964 --> 00:42:12,324
is a duplicate of Shenyuan
when he was young.

798
00:42:12,964 --> 00:42:13,764
A spitting image.

799
00:42:15,563 --> 00:42:17,123
Look. When he smiles,

800
00:42:17,123 --> 00:42:18,884
he looks like Yining.

801
00:42:21,964 --> 00:42:23,844
Dear Bao

802
00:42:23,884 --> 00:42:26,243
is really growing on me.

803
00:42:26,764 --> 00:42:28,844
Look at his strong little body.

804
00:42:28,844 --> 00:42:30,324
I can tell he'll make a good fighter.

805
00:42:30,324 --> 00:42:32,163
He'll be a general when he grows up.

806
00:42:33,043 --> 00:42:34,844
My grandson has a round forehead.

807
00:42:34,844 --> 00:42:35,559
I think

808
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:37,600
he'll become an intelligent scholar
in the future.

809
00:42:38,444 --> 00:42:39,764
Perhaps he'll become a triple

810
00:42:39,764 --> 00:42:40,804
top scorer like Shenyuan.

811
00:42:41,083 --> 00:42:42,919
Well, he's just a baby.

812
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,576
There's not much to tell
about his future.

813
00:42:44,624 --> 00:42:46,760
If Bao grows up happy,

814
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:47,904
that's all that matters.

815
00:42:48,004 --> 00:42:48,804
Third Brother,

816
00:42:49,243 --> 00:42:50,683
would you prefer him

817
00:42:50,683 --> 00:42:52,444
to be a scholar or a fighter?

818
00:42:52,884 --> 00:42:54,764
He should acquire many skills.

819
00:42:54,784 --> 00:42:56,880
It's good to have
more than one string to his bow.
