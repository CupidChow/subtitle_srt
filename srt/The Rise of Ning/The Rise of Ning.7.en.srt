(Adapted from Wen Tan's novel "Chancellor
Training Handbook" from Jinjiang Literature)

00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,780
=Episode 7=

4
00:02:26,657 --> 00:02:28,138
Lu Jiaxue sent me

5
00:02:28,258 --> 00:02:29,258
to get rid of you.

6
00:02:37,858 --> 00:02:40,258
(When a woman dies,
that's the end of her story.)

7
00:02:40,337 --> 00:02:42,337
(The end of the story...)

8
00:02:47,777 --> 00:02:48,418
No!

9
00:02:51,178 --> 00:02:51,858
Help!

10
00:02:56,698 --> 00:02:57,897
A nightmare?

11
00:03:03,937 --> 00:03:04,937
Sorry.

12
00:03:05,897 --> 00:03:08,458
I startled you earlier today.

13
00:03:11,937 --> 00:03:12,777
It's nothing.

14
00:03:14,217 --> 00:03:15,738
How is your injury?

15
00:03:16,298 --> 00:03:17,217
I'll be all right.

16
00:03:21,617 --> 00:03:22,858
Let me see it.

17
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:06,698
How did you get that wound

18
00:04:06,777 --> 00:04:07,738
on your hand?

19
00:04:11,578 --> 00:04:12,538
Earlier today,

20
00:04:12,937 --> 00:04:14,738
I got hurt while I was hunted.

21
00:04:15,057 --> 00:04:16,418
Who was hunting you?

22
00:04:18,377 --> 00:04:19,538
No idea yet.

23
00:05:08,817 --> 00:05:10,338
Could you tell me

24
00:05:10,697 --> 00:05:12,257
what your plan is?

25
00:05:14,338 --> 00:05:15,538
Why are so many people

26
00:05:15,617 --> 00:05:16,697
coming after your life?

27
00:05:18,538 --> 00:05:19,937
When I was younger,

28
00:05:20,738 --> 00:05:22,338
I worked in the dark.

29
00:05:24,418 --> 00:05:25,658
There was someone

30
00:05:26,538 --> 00:05:28,218
who lighted up the path for me.

31
00:05:31,017 --> 00:05:32,858
And now, that person is in danger.

32
00:05:34,778 --> 00:05:35,617
So...

33
00:05:39,017 --> 00:05:40,817
Should I keep investigating?

34
00:05:41,152 --> 00:05:42,290
But you're going up against

35
00:05:42,377 --> 00:05:43,338
someone very powerful.

36
00:05:43,538 --> 00:05:44,538
What are you supposed

37
00:05:44,617 --> 00:05:45,817
to fight them with?

38
00:05:49,898 --> 00:05:51,538
Determination can move mountains.

39
00:05:51,817 --> 00:05:55,057
Even an ant can shake the tree.

40
00:05:55,617 --> 00:05:57,137
I get ahead of myself,

41
00:05:57,338 --> 00:05:58,858
but there's nothing to fear.

42
00:06:02,577 --> 00:06:03,538
Shenyuan.

43
00:06:05,137 --> 00:06:06,658
You have no fear

44
00:06:06,898 --> 00:06:08,098
for kindness and grace.

45
00:06:08,738 --> 00:06:10,457
I find that quality impressive.

46
00:06:10,817 --> 00:06:12,298
But if you seek revenge,

47
00:06:12,363 --> 00:06:13,962
it will bring harm to my Grandma,

48
00:06:14,043 --> 00:06:15,123
mother, and the Luo family.

49
00:06:16,163 --> 00:06:17,723
I won't allow that.

50
00:06:24,123 --> 00:06:25,762
Someone once told me

51
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:30,550
the noble didn't complain
about fate and the people.

52
00:06:30,951 --> 00:06:32,791
It will be impossible for me
to overlook

53
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,031
my grudge for the Luo family,

54
00:06:34,088 --> 00:06:35,768
but I can assure you

55
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,720
that no innocent lives will get hurt.

56
00:06:51,387 --> 00:06:53,180
(Luo's Residence)

57
00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:01,607
Second Master.

58
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:03,328
Well? Did you find them?

59
00:07:04,168 --> 00:07:04,768
No.

60
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:05,721
Fool!

61
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:07,328
So why did you come back?

62
00:07:07,408 --> 00:07:08,208
Keep searching.

63
00:07:08,648 --> 00:07:09,328
Remember,

64
00:07:09,728 --> 00:07:10,687
keep a low profile.

65
00:07:11,208 --> 00:07:12,047
Yes.

66
00:07:16,367 --> 00:07:18,168
Mother, what brings you here?

67
00:07:18,328 --> 00:07:19,429
How can I not be here?

68
00:07:19,543 --> 00:07:20,623
Yining is missing.

69
00:07:20,656 --> 00:07:21,660
I can't just sit and wait.

70
00:07:21,743 --> 00:07:22,824
I am worried sick.

71
00:07:22,904 --> 00:07:24,704
We'll inform you when we find her.

72
00:07:24,863 --> 00:07:25,824
You'll inform me?

73
00:07:25,943 --> 00:07:26,983
It will be too late.

74
00:07:27,063 --> 00:07:28,503
We are all worried!

75
00:07:29,904 --> 00:07:30,664
Mother.

76
00:07:31,983 --> 00:07:32,743
Yuechan.

77
00:07:32,904 --> 00:07:34,503
What is it? Toothache?

78
00:07:36,503 --> 00:07:38,303
What happened to your face?

79
00:07:38,423 --> 00:07:39,824
The pain cuts deep.

80
00:07:43,943 --> 00:07:44,943
All right.

81
00:07:48,664 --> 00:07:49,584
Go.

82
00:07:50,063 --> 00:07:50,743
Mother.

83
00:07:52,704 --> 00:07:54,623
She's been gone all night.

84
00:07:54,704 --> 00:07:56,784
Instead of sending more men
to look for her,

85
00:07:57,122 --> 00:07:58,362
you order them

86
00:07:58,578 --> 00:07:59,584
to keep a low profile

87
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,039
and draw no attention.

88
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:02,704
Haven't you heard?

89
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:04,521
Someone broke into Yuanjing Pavilion.

90
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,760
There was an assassin.

91
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:07,830
Yes.

92
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:09,150
What if

93
00:08:09,415 --> 00:08:11,189
the bad guy has Yining?

94
00:08:11,429 --> 00:08:12,363
What if she's been hurt?

95
00:08:12,483 --> 00:08:13,804
She is waiting for her family

96
00:08:13,884 --> 00:08:15,684
to rescue her.

97
00:08:16,071 --> 00:08:18,283
You are being hesitant

98
00:08:18,363 --> 00:08:19,564
and dragging things out.

99
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,004
This is as good as killing her.

100
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:24,530
Mother.

101
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:26,490
Be mindful of your health.

102
00:08:26,571 --> 00:08:28,582
Forget about me.

103
00:08:28,789 --> 00:08:30,750
Send more people and search!

104
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:32,109
I am filing a report!

105
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:33,230
Mother.

106
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:34,870
We must not do that.

107
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,350
If words got out,

108
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:37,990
it'd bring great humiliation to us all.

109
00:08:38,069 --> 00:08:39,470
Humiliation?

110
00:08:40,309 --> 00:08:42,390
At this point, why should we care

111
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:44,669
about mere humiliation?

112
00:08:50,549 --> 00:08:51,590
My son.

113
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:56,230
I want my grandchild

114
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,549
to be returned to me.

115
00:08:59,829 --> 00:09:01,069
Chengzhang.

116
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:03,789
You are her father.

117
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:07,309
She is your flesh and blood.

118
00:09:07,789 --> 00:09:08,709
Mother.

119
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:11,709
That is exactly why we must be discreet.

120
00:09:11,789 --> 00:09:14,390
She is the legitimate daughter
of the Luo family.

121
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,549
If people found out

122
00:09:16,669 --> 00:09:18,189
she was out all night,

123
00:09:18,429 --> 00:09:20,429
there would be no way
to salvage our reputation.

124
00:09:20,549 --> 00:09:21,669
What about the reputation

125
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,110
of the Luo family's Madam?

126
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:24,669
I...

127
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:26,990
How did I end up

128
00:09:27,069 --> 00:09:28,870
with a son

129
00:09:28,949 --> 00:09:30,429
as heartless as you?

130
00:09:32,429 --> 00:09:34,150
Fine. I'll kneel.

131
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,628
- Mother!
- Old Madam!

132
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:36,868
- Old Madam!
- Mother!

133
00:09:36,948 --> 00:09:38,600
- Get the physician!
- We need a physician!

134
00:09:39,064 --> 00:09:40,566
(Luo's Residence)
Seventh Lady is back!

135
00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:44,748
Second Master,
Seventh Lady is back!

136
00:09:45,069 --> 00:09:45,909
Yining!

137
00:09:46,082 --> 00:09:46,842
Mother.

138
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:48,243
I'm glad you are safe.

139
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:50,562
What happened to your hand?

140
00:09:51,643 --> 00:09:53,682
It's just a scratch.

141
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:54,643
Where is Grandma?

142
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:56,842
Do you really care about her?

143
00:09:57,523 --> 00:09:58,763
Where were you last night?

144
00:09:59,042 --> 00:10:00,123
Luo Yining.

145
00:10:00,243 --> 00:10:00,842
Do not forget

146
00:10:00,962 --> 00:10:02,403
you are the legitimate daughter.

147
00:10:02,448 --> 00:10:03,208
What if

148
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,280
people find out

149
00:10:04,643 --> 00:10:06,163
you were out all night?

150
00:10:06,363 --> 00:10:07,722
My dear, you are right.

151
00:10:07,842 --> 00:10:08,842
Seventh Lady,

152
00:10:09,003 --> 00:10:10,562
take your honor seriously.

153
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:11,922
There will be ill rumors about you

154
00:10:12,003 --> 00:10:12,802
if people find out

155
00:10:12,883 --> 00:10:13,962
you didn't come home.

156
00:10:14,042 --> 00:10:15,722
Speaking of yourself!

157
00:10:16,722 --> 00:10:18,483
You should be worried
about Old Madam

158
00:10:18,603 --> 00:10:20,403
instead of wasting your time babbling.

159
00:10:20,562 --> 00:10:21,842
What does that mean?

160
00:10:22,003 --> 00:10:23,243
Grandma is sick?

161
00:10:23,363 --> 00:10:24,562
Where is she now?

162
00:10:24,682 --> 00:10:25,883
In Muxi Hall.

163
00:10:26,322 --> 00:10:27,123
Stop right there.

164
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:34,842
Don't you have any respect

165
00:10:34,962 --> 00:10:35,922
for your own father?

166
00:10:36,995 --> 00:10:38,322
You never answered me.

167
00:10:39,442 --> 00:10:39,962
Tell me,

168
00:10:40,082 --> 00:10:41,283
where were you last night?

169
00:10:42,363 --> 00:10:44,123
You should behave better.

170
00:10:45,883 --> 00:10:46,603
Unless

171
00:10:46,722 --> 00:10:47,922
I get an answer,

172
00:10:48,123 --> 00:10:49,603
you're not going anywhere!

173
00:10:51,483 --> 00:10:52,322
Soldiers came to

174
00:10:52,442 --> 00:10:54,656
Yuanjing Pavilion last night,
claiming there were thieves.

175
00:10:54,688 --> 00:10:56,000
I was going out for some fresh air,

176
00:10:56,115 --> 00:10:56,994
but I was lost.

177
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,120
I was too scared to leave.

178
00:10:58,523 --> 00:11:00,123
So, I spent the night in the woods.

179
00:11:00,202 --> 00:11:01,123
That's all.

180
00:11:01,283 --> 00:11:02,163
Second Master.

181
00:11:02,682 --> 00:11:03,523
Yining has told us

182
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,960
where she went.

183
00:11:05,243 --> 00:11:06,322
Allow her to visit

184
00:11:06,442 --> 00:11:07,163
Old Madam.

185
00:11:07,283 --> 00:11:08,123
What?

186
00:11:09,603 --> 00:11:11,883
You spent the night in the woods?

187
00:11:12,123 --> 00:11:12,962
Seventh Lady.

188
00:11:13,042 --> 00:11:14,442
You are a girl.

189
00:11:14,562 --> 00:11:15,643
You never came home.

190
00:11:15,763 --> 00:11:16,883
No one can prove your claims.

191
00:11:17,042 --> 00:11:18,574
If words got out,

192
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,200
it'd paint a bad picture of you.

193
00:11:20,442 --> 00:11:22,603
Not to mention there were thieves.

194
00:11:22,962 --> 00:11:24,243
My conscience is clear.

195
00:11:24,403 --> 00:11:25,403
I don't need to prove it.

196
00:11:25,603 --> 00:11:26,562
Who else would spread it

197
00:11:26,643 --> 00:11:28,163
if not you?

198
00:11:29,682 --> 00:11:30,802
Seventh Lady,

199
00:11:30,962 --> 00:11:32,682
don't simply jump to the conclusion.

200
00:11:32,802 --> 00:11:34,483
Mind your manners.

201
00:11:34,722 --> 00:11:36,643
You are taking this matter too lightly.

202
00:11:37,042 --> 00:11:39,003
Your honor is important.

203
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,399
This is not just about you.

204
00:11:40,562 --> 00:11:42,562
It concerns the reputation
of our family.

205
00:11:42,842 --> 00:11:44,163
I'll be honest with you.

206
00:11:44,722 --> 00:11:45,842
Your Grandma fainted

207
00:11:45,962 --> 00:11:47,403
because you went missing

208
00:11:47,523 --> 00:11:48,883
last night.

209
00:11:49,682 --> 00:11:51,603
She wasn't alone last night.

210
00:11:52,442 --> 00:11:53,322
I was there too.

211
00:11:54,483 --> 00:11:55,163
Father.

212
00:11:55,403 --> 00:11:56,363
Mother, Mistress Qiao.

213
00:11:57,363 --> 00:11:58,603
I went to Yuanjing Pavilion

214
00:11:58,682 --> 00:12:00,042
to deliver the penzai.

215
00:12:00,403 --> 00:12:01,722
I ran into Seventh Lady.

216
00:12:02,042 --> 00:12:04,322
The soldiers surrounded
Yuanjing Pavilion.

217
00:12:04,562 --> 00:12:06,682
We couldn't move
because there were thieves.

218
00:12:07,123 --> 00:12:08,922
So, we spent the night in the woods.

219
00:12:09,643 --> 00:12:11,363
Who gave you permission to go out?

220
00:12:12,096 --> 00:12:13,560
I told you to never leave the courtyard

221
00:12:13,682 --> 00:12:15,643
without my permission.

222
00:12:15,962 --> 00:12:18,202
You delivered penzai to the merchant?

223
00:12:18,322 --> 00:12:20,483
How could you stoop so low?

224
00:12:22,363 --> 00:12:23,562
I make money

225
00:12:23,962 --> 00:12:25,682
by earning a fee for delivering goods.

226
00:12:26,202 --> 00:12:27,842
How dare you talk back at me?

227
00:12:27,922 --> 00:12:28,442
Second Master.

228
00:12:28,562 --> 00:12:30,202
Please calm down.

229
00:12:30,283 --> 00:12:32,082
We should be glad Shenyuan was there.

230
00:12:32,202 --> 00:12:33,562
Had Yining been there alone,

231
00:12:33,682 --> 00:12:35,403
who knew what could have happened?

232
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,202
Since we have a witness,

233
00:12:37,283 --> 00:12:38,802
the others can't make baseless claims.

234
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,123
What makes you think so?

235
00:12:40,322 --> 00:12:42,682
Why were the two of them
and not anyone else?

236
00:12:43,003 --> 00:12:44,363
Yilian, Yiyu, and Yixiu

237
00:12:44,562 --> 00:12:46,442
all came home on time.

238
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:47,722
But not these two here!

239
00:12:49,003 --> 00:12:50,562
They wandered outside

240
00:12:50,643 --> 00:12:52,243
and almost got into trouble.

241
00:12:53,243 --> 00:12:55,322
The children returned safely.

242
00:12:55,682 --> 00:12:57,403
It is unnecessary to overreact.

243
00:12:58,643 --> 00:13:00,003
Lin Hairu.

244
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:01,403
You know what?

245
00:13:01,523 --> 00:13:03,003
It's all your fault.

246
00:13:03,123 --> 00:13:04,363
It's your way of educating

247
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:05,802
and spoiling them

248
00:13:06,442 --> 00:13:08,123
that turns them into vagrants

249
00:13:08,202 --> 00:13:09,842
with no regard for laws and manners.

250
00:13:10,363 --> 00:13:11,603
How many times have I said it?

251
00:13:11,682 --> 00:13:13,483
I told you to study and learn!

252
00:13:13,562 --> 00:13:16,123
A family of merchants
will never change.

253
00:13:18,322 --> 00:13:19,682
A family of merchants?

254
00:13:22,523 --> 00:13:24,363
What's wrong with my family?

255
00:13:25,082 --> 00:13:26,042
You guys

256
00:13:26,163 --> 00:13:27,883
rely on the money

257
00:13:28,003 --> 00:13:29,403
of a merchant's daughter

258
00:13:29,483 --> 00:13:31,922
for your daily necessities.

259
00:13:32,442 --> 00:13:34,202
Is your meager salary

260
00:13:34,464 --> 00:13:35,600
enough for our lifestyle?

261
00:13:36,363 --> 00:13:39,243
You know the answer very well.

262
00:13:45,842 --> 00:13:48,003
Lin Hairu, why you...

263
00:13:48,883 --> 00:13:49,842
You...

264
00:13:50,322 --> 00:13:51,163
I'm right here.

265
00:13:51,603 --> 00:13:52,603
What's wrong with me?

266
00:13:53,363 --> 00:13:55,243
Every coin we earn as merchants

267
00:13:55,363 --> 00:13:56,682
is legitimate.

268
00:13:56,763 --> 00:13:57,603
We do business

269
00:13:57,722 --> 00:13:58,883
with honesty and trust.

270
00:13:59,003 --> 00:14:00,643
How are we disregarding the laws?

271
00:14:00,842 --> 00:14:01,802
Madam.

272
00:14:02,163 --> 00:14:03,283
That is inadequate.

273
00:14:03,403 --> 00:14:04,682
You are in no place to speak.

274
00:14:05,403 --> 00:14:06,123
Second Master

275
00:14:06,202 --> 00:14:07,322
barely rested for a moment.

276
00:14:07,442 --> 00:14:08,322
Do you not care

277
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,201
about his health?

278
00:14:09,322 --> 00:14:10,842
He only gave the children a warning

279
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,800
so they could behave.

280
00:14:11,962 --> 00:14:13,042
What's wrong with that?

281
00:14:14,202 --> 00:14:15,003
Yuechan.

282
00:14:15,056 --> 00:14:15,680
It's all right.

283
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,481
I was blinded by my frustration for her.

284
00:14:18,163 --> 00:14:18,842
Calm down.

285
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:20,722
- I was blinded by the frustration.
- Take care.

286
00:14:20,802 --> 00:14:21,883
I know.

287
00:14:21,962 --> 00:14:22,883
Butler Bai.

288
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:24,243
Where is Butler Bai?

289
00:14:24,283 --> 00:14:24,722
I'm here.

290
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:26,442
Lock this insensible girl

291
00:14:26,562 --> 00:14:28,003
in the Ancestral Shrine.

292
00:14:28,202 --> 00:14:29,322
Do not let her out

293
00:14:29,523 --> 00:14:30,523
until she has reflected.

294
00:14:32,283 --> 00:14:33,042
And this boy here.

295
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,842
Go outside and receive 20 strikes.

296
00:14:35,922 --> 00:14:37,682
Don't you dare lay a finger on them.

297
00:14:40,523 --> 00:14:41,322
Father.

298
00:14:41,682 --> 00:14:42,883
I never wanted thieves

299
00:14:43,003 --> 00:14:44,202
to break into Yuanjing Pavilion.

300
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:45,483
What if I wandered around

301
00:14:45,603 --> 00:14:47,082
and ran into the thieves?

302
00:14:47,322 --> 00:14:48,722
What about the family's reputation?

303
00:14:49,682 --> 00:14:51,842
Shenyuan didn't make a mistake.

304
00:14:52,003 --> 00:14:53,603
We did what we did
to keep ourselves safe

305
00:14:53,722 --> 00:14:55,202
and the Luo family's reputation.

306
00:14:55,363 --> 00:14:56,562
We did nothing wrong.

307
00:14:58,003 --> 00:15:00,682
They are getting too rebellious.

308
00:15:01,243 --> 00:15:03,562
Getting rebellious, aren't you?

309
00:15:03,682 --> 00:15:04,802
No.

310
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:07,136
The first line of the family rule

311
00:15:07,168 --> 00:15:08,120
is being filial.

312
00:15:08,842 --> 00:15:09,922
Old Madam might still

313
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:10,603
be worried

314
00:15:10,722 --> 00:15:12,202
about Seventh Lady's safety.

315
00:15:12,643 --> 00:15:13,483
Indeed.

316
00:15:13,883 --> 00:15:15,163
You can punish us

317
00:15:15,283 --> 00:15:17,682
after we've visited my Grandma.

318
00:15:19,003 --> 00:15:19,603
Let's go.

319
00:15:22,603 --> 00:15:23,322
It's not worth it.

320
00:15:23,403 --> 00:15:24,643
My dear, it's not worth it.

321
00:15:28,802 --> 00:15:29,763
Physician Li.

322
00:15:30,442 --> 00:15:31,722
How is

323
00:15:31,842 --> 00:15:33,163
my Grandma's condition?

324
00:15:34,003 --> 00:15:36,202
As I mentioned before,

325
00:15:36,483 --> 00:15:38,283
if Old Madam Luo had another episode,

326
00:15:38,403 --> 00:15:39,722
it'd be extremely dangerous.

327
00:15:40,363 --> 00:15:42,133
There is nothing more

328
00:15:42,202 --> 00:15:43,082
I could do for her.

329
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,320
You should prepare for the worst.

330
00:15:45,802 --> 00:15:46,722
Physician Li.

331
00:15:46,962 --> 00:15:48,523
Can't you think of another way?

332
00:15:49,403 --> 00:15:51,523
Only Physician Du can help.

333
00:15:51,842 --> 00:15:52,883
Physician Du?

334
00:15:53,668 --> 00:15:55,722
Where is this physician now?

335
00:15:55,922 --> 00:15:57,922
Physician Du was recruited
into the palace

336
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,481
from Guangnan.

337
00:15:59,802 --> 00:16:02,320
The Empress Dowager has been
having heart problems.

338
00:16:02,489 --> 00:16:03,008
Very well.

339
00:16:03,123 --> 00:16:04,603
I'll wait outside the palace.

340
00:16:04,682 --> 00:16:05,643
As soon as he comes out,

341
00:16:05,722 --> 00:16:06,962
I'll bring him here.

342
00:16:08,123 --> 00:16:09,763
A bunch of fools.

343
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:11,363
They couldn't even get rid

344
00:16:11,483 --> 00:16:12,322
of the little girl.

345
00:16:12,603 --> 00:16:13,962
It was a waste of money and time

346
00:16:14,082 --> 00:16:15,562
to keep them.

347
00:16:15,842 --> 00:16:17,763
Mistress Qiao, calm down.

348
00:16:17,776 --> 00:16:18,560
Fifth Master Qiao

349
00:16:18,643 --> 00:16:20,202
went to Yangzhou

350
00:16:20,283 --> 00:16:21,523
due to the recent predicament.

351
00:16:21,603 --> 00:16:23,283
He will bring the physician here.

352
00:16:23,363 --> 00:16:24,643
If the trip to Yangzhou

353
00:16:24,842 --> 00:16:26,082
fails to bring any good news,

354
00:16:26,243 --> 00:16:27,562
I'll have a hard time.

355
00:16:27,682 --> 00:16:29,202
He shall suffer as I do.

356
00:16:29,283 --> 00:16:30,322
Fifth Master Qiao

357
00:16:30,403 --> 00:16:31,603
will do his best.

358
00:16:31,763 --> 00:16:32,722
He knows

359
00:16:32,842 --> 00:16:33,842
you are the only one

360
00:16:33,922 --> 00:16:35,123
he can count on.

361
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:36,163
Of course.

362
00:16:36,322 --> 00:16:37,163
My little brother

363
00:16:37,283 --> 00:16:38,763
wouldn't have made it this far

364
00:16:38,883 --> 00:16:39,722
without the lands

365
00:16:39,802 --> 00:16:40,842
and shops

366
00:16:40,883 --> 00:16:42,403
I got from the Luo family.

367
00:16:42,763 --> 00:16:43,562
He knows ever since

368
00:16:43,568 --> 00:16:44,960
our eldest brother became an erudite

369
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:45,962
and the family head,

370
00:16:46,003 --> 00:16:47,483
he's been seen as a nuisance.

371
00:16:47,603 --> 00:16:49,442
Therefore, Fifth Master Qiao

372
00:16:49,523 --> 00:16:51,123
will carry out his mission.

373
00:16:52,562 --> 00:16:54,283
I hope so.

374
00:17:09,603 --> 00:17:11,002
What about

375
00:17:12,002 --> 00:17:12,962
Li Yinglong's stuff?

376
00:17:13,123 --> 00:17:14,803
Qi An said it was acquired.

377
00:17:15,403 --> 00:17:16,002
Young Master,

378
00:17:16,123 --> 00:17:17,643
you should rest and heal.

379
00:17:17,762 --> 00:17:19,403
Your injury is too severe.

380
00:17:20,363 --> 00:17:21,762
Any news

381
00:17:22,482 --> 00:17:23,762
about Physician Du?

382
00:17:24,323 --> 00:17:25,242
He was secretly sent

383
00:17:25,363 --> 00:17:26,442
to the palace last night.

384
00:17:26,643 --> 00:17:28,403
And the ambergris he asked for?

385
00:17:28,962 --> 00:17:29,803
We got one.

386
00:17:29,922 --> 00:17:31,083
It is white and the finest.

387
00:17:31,442 --> 00:17:32,282
It should have

388
00:17:32,403 --> 00:17:33,282
been Luzhou recently.

389
00:17:33,563 --> 00:17:34,202
Even with

390
00:17:34,323 --> 00:17:35,403
our fastest horses,

391
00:17:35,682 --> 00:17:37,043
it'll take two days to get there.

392
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,720
Forget it. I'll see to it myself.

393
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:43,803
Young Master, you mustn't.

394
00:17:44,002 --> 00:17:45,002
All the gates

395
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:45,843
are heavily guarded.

396
00:17:45,922 --> 00:17:47,083
Not to mention you are injured.

397
00:17:47,202 --> 00:17:48,323
You must rest.

398
00:17:48,403 --> 00:17:50,843
Old Madam's sickness can't wait.

399
00:17:50,962 --> 00:17:51,603
Young Master.

400
00:17:52,482 --> 00:17:53,123
Let me see it.

401
00:17:56,336 --> 00:17:57,080
Your pass to leave?

402
00:17:57,202 --> 00:17:57,762
Officer.

403
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:01,440
Longquan Trading House?

404
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,090
Yes.

405
00:18:02,363 --> 00:18:03,417
My boss ordered me

406
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,520
to head south for goods.

407
00:18:04,722 --> 00:18:05,403
I'll miss out

408
00:18:05,456 --> 00:18:06,720
on all the good stuff if I'm late.

409
00:18:06,803 --> 00:18:07,803
Please do me a favor.

410
00:18:08,123 --> 00:18:08,722
Your bag.

411
00:18:09,803 --> 00:18:11,563
Just some clothing.

412
00:18:13,363 --> 00:18:13,762
Thanks.

413
00:18:13,883 --> 00:18:14,323
Go on.

414
00:18:14,522 --> 00:18:15,323
Cousin.

415
00:18:22,722 --> 00:18:24,323
What do you need, sir?

416
00:18:26,843 --> 00:18:28,163
I am terribly sorry.

417
00:18:28,363 --> 00:18:30,828
You look strikingly similar

418
00:18:30,962 --> 00:18:31,643
to my cousin

419
00:18:31,762 --> 00:18:33,043
from behind.

420
00:18:33,202 --> 00:18:33,962
Is that so?

421
00:18:34,843 --> 00:18:36,522
I think

422
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,080
we may have met somewhere.

423
00:18:39,363 --> 00:18:40,803
I'm sure you are mistaken.

424
00:18:40,962 --> 00:18:42,682
I must be on my way now.

425
00:18:48,522 --> 00:18:49,603
Send the words out.

426
00:18:50,043 --> 00:18:51,722
Ask them to check

427
00:18:51,744 --> 00:18:53,120
anyone with a sword wound on the back

428
00:18:53,163 --> 00:18:54,324
and difficulty moving.

429
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:54,880
Yes.

430
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:36,600
(Yanxing Gate)

431
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:04,297
(Yanxing Gate)

432
00:20:07,883 --> 00:20:09,043
Please wait.

433
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:11,482
May I know if Physician Du

434
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,760
is in this carriage?

435
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:13,563
Yes.

436
00:20:13,762 --> 00:20:15,522
Young Lady, what do you need?

437
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,512
I'm Luo Yining, the daughter
of Luo Chengzhang of Imperial Court of Judicial.

438
00:20:18,528 --> 00:20:19,640
My grandma has heart disease.

439
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,784
She is in a critical condition.

440
00:20:20,803 --> 00:20:21,803
Could we ask Physician Du

441
00:20:21,883 --> 00:20:23,040
to examine her?

442
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,840
Physician Du is unwell.

443
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,320
He can't practice medicine.

444
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,760
We are terribly sorry.

445
00:20:28,123 --> 00:20:28,922
But my grandma

446
00:20:29,002 --> 00:20:30,202
is very ill.

447
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,081
No other healers could help her.

448
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,000
Physician Du is a brilliant healer.

449
00:20:34,123 --> 00:20:35,002
We need Physician Du

450
00:20:35,123 --> 00:20:36,123
to save my grandma.

451
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,361
I'll kneel if I must.

452
00:20:37,883 --> 00:20:38,762
Young Lady!

453
00:20:38,883 --> 00:20:40,242
Please stand up.

454
00:20:40,363 --> 00:20:40,922
Physician Du

455
00:20:41,043 --> 00:20:42,482
is in no shape to offer any help.

456
00:20:42,603 --> 00:20:43,803
Please stand up.

457
00:20:43,883 --> 00:20:45,043
I'll explain everything.

458
00:20:48,883 --> 00:20:50,403
Do you know why Physician Du

459
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:52,242
is skilled at treating heart diseases?

460
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:55,843
Physician Du also suffers
from a heart disease.

461
00:20:56,002 --> 00:20:57,962
After days of toiling in the palace,

462
00:20:58,002 --> 00:20:59,522
his body has taken a toll.

463
00:20:59,643 --> 00:21:00,563
He can't even hold

464
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,440
a needle steadily.

465
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,760
If you don't believe it,

466
00:21:02,883 --> 00:21:04,043
there's not much I can do.

467
00:21:04,163 --> 00:21:05,083
Young Lady.

468
00:21:05,202 --> 00:21:07,083
You should go.

469
00:21:07,163 --> 00:21:07,803
Let's wait

470
00:21:07,922 --> 00:21:09,482
until my master is awake.

471
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:11,002
Goodbye.

472
00:21:12,442 --> 00:21:13,043
Let's move on.

473
00:21:16,002 --> 00:21:16,922
Physician Du!

474
00:21:17,282 --> 00:21:18,202
Physician Du!

475
00:21:18,323 --> 00:21:20,043
Please save my grandma!

476
00:21:20,163 --> 00:21:22,643
Physician Du! Please!

477
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:26,883
Xue Zhi,

478
00:21:26,968 --> 00:21:28,609
head back and check on my grandma.

479
00:21:28,722 --> 00:21:29,762
If she is awake,

480
00:21:29,843 --> 00:21:31,323
find me at Physician Du's home.

481
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,240
What about you?

482
00:21:32,363 --> 00:21:33,202
Go on.

483
00:21:33,563 --> 00:21:34,163
Yes.

484
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,347
(Luo's Residence)

485
00:21:57,536 --> 00:21:58,136
Physician Li.

486
00:21:58,217 --> 00:21:59,257
How is my mother?

487
00:21:59,531 --> 00:22:00,412
Registrar Luo.

488
00:22:00,531 --> 00:22:01,938
I did everything I could

489
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,279
to slow down the disease.

490
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,600
But it won't hold for much longer.

491
00:22:27,196 --> 00:22:28,931
My dear, take care.

492
00:22:29,172 --> 00:22:30,372
Seventh Lady went out

493
00:22:30,444 --> 00:22:32,125
to bring Physician Du here.

494
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,960
She should be back by now.

495
00:22:34,092 --> 00:22:35,412
Physician Du

496
00:22:35,731 --> 00:22:38,052
was ordered to treat
the Empress Dowager.

497
00:22:40,332 --> 00:22:41,731
The Luo family's influence

498
00:22:42,172 --> 00:22:44,052
is dwindling.

499
00:22:44,172 --> 00:22:45,971
We're not worthy of his help.

500
00:22:48,412 --> 00:22:49,412
Yuechan.

501
00:22:49,652 --> 00:22:51,691
I fear my mother

502
00:22:52,011 --> 00:22:53,531
might leave us.

503
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,120
You are a filial son.

504
00:22:55,652 --> 00:22:57,531
But fate has its plan.

505
00:23:08,491 --> 00:23:11,372
The physician has made it clear to us.

506
00:23:12,011 --> 00:23:14,132
Should we start preparing

507
00:23:15,291 --> 00:23:17,332
Old Madam's funeral?

508
00:23:18,172 --> 00:23:19,478
Without preparation,

509
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,600
rushing it

510
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,200
will further tarnish our reputation.

511
00:23:22,691 --> 00:23:24,451
First Master is away for his job.

512
00:23:24,731 --> 00:23:26,691
You are the family head now.

513
00:23:26,812 --> 00:23:28,052
In a critical time like this,

514
00:23:28,172 --> 00:23:29,892
aside from the funeral,

515
00:23:29,971 --> 00:23:31,211
you must make an inventory

516
00:23:31,291 --> 00:23:33,412
of Old Madam's land, real estate,

517
00:23:33,491 --> 00:23:34,629
and shops.

518
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,660
You know what must be done.

519
00:23:35,749 --> 00:23:36,708
Insolence!

520
00:23:38,109 --> 00:23:39,428
My mother is still alive.

521
00:23:39,989 --> 00:23:41,589
How dare you speak

522
00:23:41,668 --> 00:23:43,228
of such a heinous action!

523
00:23:43,428 --> 00:23:44,628
I meant no offense.

524
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:47,029
I pray to Buddha

525
00:23:47,109 --> 00:23:48,509
for Old Madam's health.

526
00:23:48,708 --> 00:23:49,589
I want her

527
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:51,029
to be safe and sound.

528
00:23:51,188 --> 00:23:52,549
But I...

529
00:23:53,708 --> 00:23:56,148
I only want what's best for you.

530
00:23:57,228 --> 00:23:58,868
Madam Lin's words

531
00:23:58,989 --> 00:24:00,349
were very harsh.

532
00:24:00,668 --> 00:24:01,749
She claimed

533
00:24:01,868 --> 00:24:03,509
you were living off the money

534
00:24:03,628 --> 00:24:04,549
her family makes.

535
00:24:04,829 --> 00:24:06,829
Even I thought that was too much.

536
00:24:07,549 --> 00:24:08,349
Besides,

537
00:24:08,589 --> 00:24:09,589
if anything happens

538
00:24:09,668 --> 00:24:10,789
to Old Madam,

539
00:24:10,908 --> 00:24:12,668
you will need the wealth

540
00:24:12,749 --> 00:24:13,708
to secure your future

541
00:24:13,789 --> 00:24:15,789
by paying for favors.

542
00:24:15,948 --> 00:24:16,628
What is it?

543
00:24:16,749 --> 00:24:17,509
Do you want to live

544
00:24:17,628 --> 00:24:18,549
at Madam Lin's grace

545
00:24:18,589 --> 00:24:19,668
for the rest of your life?

546
00:24:23,708 --> 00:24:24,628
My dear.

547
00:24:25,228 --> 00:24:27,628
I only want you

548
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:31,468
to think about your own future.

549
00:24:49,117 --> 00:24:50,650
(Du's Residence)

550
00:25:00,589 --> 00:25:02,228
Young Lady, you can stop waiting now.

551
00:25:02,549 --> 00:25:04,428
Please let me see Physician Du.

552
00:25:05,069 --> 00:25:06,708
Master, take it slowly.

553
00:25:06,789 --> 00:25:07,628
Yes.

577
00:26:25,829 --> 00:26:27,309
My master wants some carrots.

578
00:26:27,428 --> 00:26:28,749
I'm going to the garden

579
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:29,761
to get him some carrots.

580
00:26:30,148 --> 00:26:31,109
I'll do it for you.

581
00:26:31,228 --> 00:26:32,829
Stay and take care of him.

582
00:26:34,188 --> 00:26:35,868
You can count on me.

583
00:26:40,668 --> 00:26:43,269
Master, you need rest.

584
00:26:44,029 --> 00:26:45,109
It's all right.

585
00:26:45,309 --> 00:26:46,549
Where is the girl?

586
00:26:47,069 --> 00:26:48,789
She is getting you the carrots.

587
00:26:50,668 --> 00:26:53,269
A girl as filial as her
is hard to come by these days.

588
00:26:53,749 --> 00:26:54,829
It's a shame

589
00:26:54,948 --> 00:26:57,468
we've run out of ambergris.

590
00:26:57,876 --> 00:27:00,035
Self-treatment is not possible.

591
00:27:00,196 --> 00:27:01,954
She will only leave

592
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:02,880
with disappointment.

593
00:27:03,595 --> 00:27:04,396
Physician Du.

594
00:27:04,722 --> 00:27:05,482
Who are you?

595
00:27:05,488 --> 00:27:06,080
Who let you in?

596
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:06,680
Physician Du.

597
00:27:06,927 --> 00:27:08,568
I am here out of desperation.

598
00:27:10,727 --> 00:27:11,407
Master.

599
00:27:15,663 --> 00:27:16,863
Ambergris.

600
00:27:16,944 --> 00:27:17,544
Yes.

601
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,020
Of all the ingredients
in your prescription,

602
00:27:20,846 --> 00:27:22,183
the fine ambergris was

603
00:27:22,304 --> 00:27:23,183
the hardest to procure.

604
00:27:23,941 --> 00:27:25,461
I am giving it to you.

605
00:27:25,701 --> 00:27:26,745
If you get well

606
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,681
and practice medicine,

607
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,600
it will benefit the people too.

608
00:27:30,127 --> 00:27:31,246
I doubt you only came

609
00:27:31,961 --> 00:27:32,842
to deliver me

610
00:27:32,921 --> 00:27:34,241
this precious gift.

611
00:27:35,401 --> 00:27:36,362
Physician Du.

612
00:27:37,401 --> 00:27:39,002
You are a brilliant healer.

613
00:27:40,042 --> 00:27:41,481
I beg of you

614
00:27:41,721 --> 00:27:43,522
to treat Old Madam Luo.

615
00:27:43,921 --> 00:27:45,441
Are you from the Luo family?

616
00:27:45,562 --> 00:27:46,042
No.

617
00:27:47,362 --> 00:27:48,522
But please,

618
00:27:49,641 --> 00:27:51,362
tend to Old Madam Luo
as soon as possible.

619
00:27:53,282 --> 00:27:54,161
Mister.

620
00:27:55,161 --> 00:27:56,241
The injury on your back

621
00:27:56,602 --> 00:27:58,122
seems very serious.

622
00:27:59,042 --> 00:27:59,721
I'll be all right.

623
00:28:08,641 --> 00:28:09,282
Young Lady!

624
00:28:13,641 --> 00:28:14,681
You're finally back.

625
00:28:14,802 --> 00:28:16,721
Physician Du is heading
to the Luo's Residence.

626
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:24,480
(Luo's Residence)

627
00:28:47,762 --> 00:28:49,335
I didn't expect Seventh Lady

628
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,000
to actually bring Physician Du here.

629
00:28:51,201 --> 00:28:52,441
You've said enough.

630
00:28:52,562 --> 00:28:54,322
Don't disturb the physician.

631
00:28:58,721 --> 00:28:59,481
Physician Du.

632
00:28:59,721 --> 00:29:01,082
How is my mother?

633
00:29:02,762 --> 00:29:05,201
I've cured diseases like this.

634
00:29:05,322 --> 00:29:07,681
However, everyone's body is unique.

635
00:29:07,802 --> 00:29:09,602
Everyone has a different condition.

636
00:29:10,282 --> 00:29:11,241
If Old Madam Luo

637
00:29:11,681 --> 00:29:12,562
awakes

638
00:29:12,641 --> 00:29:14,522
within the next two hours,

639
00:29:14,721 --> 00:29:16,881
she shall be safe.

640
00:29:18,921 --> 00:29:19,842
Physician Du.

641
00:29:20,122 --> 00:29:21,961
You may rest in the guest room.

642
00:29:22,082 --> 00:29:22,762
Very well.

643
00:29:23,842 --> 00:29:25,042
We should go out.

644
00:29:25,122 --> 00:29:26,681
Let Mother rest.

645
00:29:27,802 --> 00:29:29,602
Father, Mother,

646
00:29:30,282 --> 00:29:31,921
allow me to stay here.

647
00:29:33,122 --> 00:29:34,762
Physician Du. Come with us.

648
00:29:34,881 --> 00:29:35,282
Yes.

649
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,289
(Muxi Hall)

650
00:29:49,522 --> 00:29:51,441
Seventh Lady, take some rest.

651
00:29:51,721 --> 00:29:53,802
I will watch over Old Madam.

652
00:29:56,441 --> 00:29:57,481
Grandma.

653
00:29:59,441 --> 00:30:01,322
Grandma, won't you wake up now?

654
00:30:03,441 --> 00:30:04,762
If you keep sleeping,

655
00:30:05,122 --> 00:30:06,842
who can keep me company?

656
00:30:18,322 --> 00:30:19,161
Grandma?

657
00:30:22,161 --> 00:30:23,002
Grandma?

658
00:30:23,481 --> 00:30:24,362
Old Madam.

659
00:30:27,602 --> 00:30:28,562
Grandma?

660
00:30:29,401 --> 00:30:31,802
I see you.

661
00:30:35,562 --> 00:30:37,921
I still have some life in me.

662
00:30:39,802 --> 00:30:42,802
I did my best to open my eyes

663
00:30:43,362 --> 00:30:45,161
so I could

664
00:30:46,042 --> 00:30:48,602
see you again.

665
00:30:48,881 --> 00:30:49,921
Ms. Xu.

666
00:30:50,002 --> 00:30:51,602
Bring Physician Du here.

667
00:30:51,721 --> 00:30:52,241
Yes.

668
00:30:59,082 --> 00:31:00,842
You've had enough sleep for one day.

669
00:31:04,562 --> 00:31:06,881
Yes. Certainly.

670
00:31:26,201 --> 00:31:27,522
You will be relieved to know

671
00:31:27,681 --> 00:31:29,042
Old Madam Luo

672
00:31:29,161 --> 00:31:30,602
has been stabilized.

673
00:31:30,681 --> 00:31:32,641
She will be well.

674
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,095
(Jimo House)

675
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:43,881
Young Master.

676
00:31:44,002 --> 00:31:45,201
At this rate,

677
00:31:45,282 --> 00:31:46,401
you could lose your life.

678
00:31:46,481 --> 00:31:47,401
Qi An and I

679
00:31:47,481 --> 00:31:48,762
will need a new employer.

680
00:31:49,602 --> 00:31:51,241
Is Old Madam all right?

681
00:31:51,322 --> 00:31:52,161
She is awake.

682
00:31:52,481 --> 00:31:53,961
Young Master, I don't understand.

683
00:31:54,042 --> 00:31:55,322
You said that family was none of

684
00:31:55,362 --> 00:31:56,322
your concern.

685
00:31:58,522 --> 00:31:59,681
Take it easy!

686
00:32:00,042 --> 00:32:01,201
Now you know pain.

687
00:32:01,401 --> 00:32:02,522
You are heavily wounded.

688
00:32:02,544 --> 00:32:03,840
Then, you gave away the ambergris

689
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,840
that was worth a fortune.

690
00:32:04,921 --> 00:32:06,362
What is it you want to achieve?

691
00:32:08,481 --> 00:32:10,161
Did you find out who those two thieves

692
00:32:10,224 --> 00:32:11,200
at Yuanjing Pavilion were?

693
00:32:11,322 --> 00:32:12,721
They worked for Fifth Master Qiao.

694
00:32:12,881 --> 00:32:13,522
I bet

695
00:32:13,602 --> 00:32:15,122
this is Mistress Qiao's doing.

696
00:32:15,362 --> 00:32:15,961
Young Master,

697
00:32:16,161 --> 00:32:17,282
what happened to you

698
00:32:17,401 --> 00:32:18,282
and Seventh Lady?

699
00:32:18,641 --> 00:32:19,721
She was at Yuanjing Pavilion

700
00:32:19,842 --> 00:32:21,082
and saw me kill someone.

701
00:32:21,282 --> 00:32:22,522
What do we do now?

702
00:32:22,721 --> 00:32:24,241
Will she tell Old Madam?

703
00:32:24,522 --> 00:32:25,362
No.

704
00:32:25,641 --> 00:32:26,762
If she wanted to betray me,

705
00:32:26,881 --> 00:32:28,122
she would've said it that day.

706
00:32:28,441 --> 00:32:30,481
Young Master, you trust her a lot.

707
00:32:36,522 --> 00:32:38,282
Thank heaven

708
00:32:38,441 --> 00:32:39,961
that Old Madam got better.

709
00:32:40,401 --> 00:32:41,161
Tonight,

710
00:32:41,241 --> 00:32:42,881
Physician Du will stay to treat her.

711
00:32:43,042 --> 00:32:43,681
Yining,

712
00:32:43,762 --> 00:32:45,161
get some rest.

713
00:32:45,441 --> 00:32:47,762
You've been through a lot.

714
00:32:48,362 --> 00:32:49,762
I can manage.

715
00:32:50,122 --> 00:32:51,881
All I want is
for Grandma to be safe.

716
00:32:52,362 --> 00:32:53,881
It's been a trying time for you.

717
00:32:54,122 --> 00:32:55,762
You don't look too well.

718
00:32:55,881 --> 00:32:56,641
Perhaps

719
00:32:56,721 --> 00:32:58,241
we should Physician Du to examine you.

720
00:32:58,602 --> 00:32:59,602
I'm all right.

721
00:32:59,762 --> 00:33:01,042
Let him tend

722
00:33:01,122 --> 00:33:02,441
to Grandma for the time being.

723
00:33:02,602 --> 00:33:04,441
You are pushing yourself too hard.

724
00:33:05,122 --> 00:33:06,282
Xue Zhi left you

725
00:33:06,362 --> 00:33:07,362
at Du's Residence.

726
00:33:07,481 --> 00:33:09,082
I've lectured her for that.

727
00:33:09,401 --> 00:33:10,401
How could she

728
00:33:10,522 --> 00:33:11,481
leave you there?

729
00:33:11,602 --> 00:33:12,441
By the way,

730
00:33:12,562 --> 00:33:13,322
I haven't

731
00:33:13,441 --> 00:33:14,842
seen Qing Qu for some time.

732
00:33:15,921 --> 00:33:17,921
She is away,
running some errands for me.

733
00:33:18,441 --> 00:33:20,282
Mother, don't hold it against Xue Zhi.

734
00:33:20,441 --> 00:33:22,282
She only did as I ordered.

735
00:33:23,522 --> 00:33:24,161
You only

736
00:33:24,282 --> 00:33:25,842
have Xue Zhi as your personal servant.

737
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:26,681
That won't do.

738
00:33:26,762 --> 00:33:27,441
I'll assign you

739
00:33:27,562 --> 00:33:29,401
another servant.

740
00:33:30,002 --> 00:33:31,241
Thank you, Mother.

741
00:33:33,241 --> 00:33:34,602
That looks like

742
00:33:34,602 --> 00:33:36,362
the hard labor servants
from Bilian Pavilion.

743
00:33:36,481 --> 00:33:38,282
Why are they acting all mysterious?

744
00:33:38,961 --> 00:33:40,362
We should follow them.

745
00:33:47,522 --> 00:33:48,602
Did anyone spot you

746
00:33:48,681 --> 00:33:49,802
on the way here?

747
00:33:50,241 --> 00:33:51,762
We took a detour around the garden.

748
00:33:51,842 --> 00:33:52,881
No one saw us.

749
00:33:53,641 --> 00:33:55,721
Wrap these up with clothes.

750
00:33:55,842 --> 00:33:57,282
The sight of them brings gloom.

751
00:33:57,362 --> 00:33:58,042
Yes.

752
00:33:58,681 --> 00:34:00,681
Fate has a different plan for her.

753
00:34:00,802 --> 00:34:02,921
Old Madam is tougher than expected.

754
00:34:03,042 --> 00:34:04,602
Mistress Qiao, relax.

755
00:34:04,681 --> 00:34:06,201
Given her old age

756
00:34:06,282 --> 00:34:07,002
and waning body,

757
00:34:07,082 --> 00:34:08,482
these will come in handy eventually.

758
00:34:11,482 --> 00:34:12,721
Mistress Qiao is here.

759
00:34:13,681 --> 00:34:14,562
Sneaking around

760
00:34:14,641 --> 00:34:16,522
and up to no good?

761
00:34:18,082 --> 00:34:19,321
Madam Lin,

762
00:34:19,402 --> 00:34:20,321
I ordered the servants

763
00:34:20,442 --> 00:34:21,241
to pack up the things

764
00:34:21,361 --> 00:34:22,482
meant to be discarded.

765
00:34:33,522 --> 00:34:34,721
Young Lady, Madam Lin,

766
00:34:34,841 --> 00:34:36,442
these are meant for a funeral.

767
00:34:43,321 --> 00:34:44,721
You didn't care when Old Madam

768
00:34:44,801 --> 00:34:45,801
was sick.

769
00:34:46,016 --> 00:34:47,962
But you're eager to hold a funeral.

770
00:34:48,122 --> 00:34:49,801
What are you up to this time?

771
00:34:50,766 --> 00:34:52,562
You misunderstood.

772
00:34:52,801 --> 00:34:53,922
These were prepared

773
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:54,759
when she was ill.

774
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:55,679
Second Master

775
00:34:55,962 --> 00:34:57,562
ordered me to prepare for the worst.

776
00:34:57,681 --> 00:34:58,281
Should things

777
00:34:58,321 --> 00:35:00,281
have gone badly for us,

778
00:35:00,361 --> 00:35:02,281
the reputation of our family
would be at stake.

779
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:03,161
But now,

780
00:35:03,241 --> 00:35:04,752
Old Madam is safe and sound.

781
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,639
These items

782
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,320
are no longer needed.

783
00:35:07,562 --> 00:35:09,402
I was told many noble families
in the capital

784
00:35:09,522 --> 00:35:10,962
have the same practice.

785
00:35:11,082 --> 00:35:12,962
It's not my fault

786
00:35:13,141 --> 00:35:14,721
that you didn't know.

787
00:35:15,082 --> 00:35:15,482
It seems

788
00:35:15,562 --> 00:35:17,482
we misunderstood Mistress Qiao.

789
00:35:18,288 --> 00:35:19,402
Mistress Qiao

790
00:35:19,522 --> 00:35:21,201
is so thoughtful.

791
00:35:21,321 --> 00:35:23,042
It's my duty.

792
00:35:23,122 --> 00:35:24,801
Old Madam is well again.

793
00:35:24,882 --> 00:35:26,681
We are all relieved.

794
00:35:27,402 --> 00:35:29,122
Thankfully, Grandma is safe.

795
00:35:29,321 --> 00:35:31,002
Otherwise, I swear to find out

796
00:35:31,122 --> 00:35:32,002
who plotted

797
00:35:32,082 --> 00:35:33,361
the attack against me

798
00:35:33,442 --> 00:35:35,361
at Yuanjing Pavilion.

799
00:35:36,761 --> 00:35:37,442
I have no idea

800
00:35:37,562 --> 00:35:39,321
what you're talking about.

801
00:35:40,281 --> 00:35:41,402
The other day,

802
00:35:41,522 --> 00:35:43,082
you said my pale yellow cloth jacket

803
00:35:43,161 --> 00:35:44,321
matched the landscape

804
00:35:44,442 --> 00:35:45,361
of Yuanjing Pavilion.

805
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,081
It seemed as though
you were praising me,

806
00:35:47,082 --> 00:35:48,002
but those words

807
00:35:48,122 --> 00:35:49,962
were meant for assailants.

808
00:35:50,522 --> 00:35:51,801
What assailants?

809
00:35:55,082 --> 00:35:57,681
Actions leave traces.

810
00:35:57,922 --> 00:36:00,241
Mistress Qiao, be mindful
of your actions.

811
00:36:06,042 --> 00:36:06,761
Xue Zhi.

812
00:36:07,002 --> 00:36:07,962
Order them

813
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:08,841
to get rid

814
00:36:08,962 --> 00:36:09,962
of these ill-fated items.

815
00:36:10,122 --> 00:36:12,281
Grandma will get well

816
00:36:12,482 --> 00:36:14,042
and live a long life.

817
00:36:55,122 --> 00:36:55,761
Young Lady,

818
00:36:55,882 --> 00:36:57,082
Madam Lin had a fight

819
00:36:57,161 --> 00:36:58,082
with Second Master

820
00:36:58,122 --> 00:36:59,761
over Mistress Qiao's funeral items.

821
00:37:03,562 --> 00:37:04,721
It's pointless.

822
00:37:07,161 --> 00:37:09,082
Whatever Mistress Qiao does

823
00:37:09,681 --> 00:37:11,681
is what my father has in mind.

824
00:37:12,402 --> 00:37:14,161
He would never resent Mistress Qiao.

825
00:37:14,321 --> 00:37:15,402
Who cares?

826
00:37:15,522 --> 00:37:16,641
We deserve some justice.

827
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:18,241
Young Lady,

828
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:19,761
Madam Lin ordered Song Zhi

829
00:37:19,841 --> 00:37:20,761
to bring you

830
00:37:20,841 --> 00:37:22,321
astragalus and peony root soup.

831
00:37:22,402 --> 00:37:23,161
She said that

832
00:37:23,281 --> 00:37:24,761
now that Qing Qu is away,

833
00:37:24,841 --> 00:37:25,681
Song Zhi shall stay

834
00:37:25,721 --> 00:37:27,201
as your servant.

835
00:37:28,841 --> 00:37:30,082
How thoughtful of her.

836
00:37:30,442 --> 00:37:31,761
The soup is too bitter.

837
00:37:32,042 --> 00:37:33,522
I'll drink it when it's cool.

838
00:37:37,761 --> 00:37:39,761
Young Lady, what happened to your hand?

839
00:37:41,122 --> 00:37:42,321
Someone tried to kill me

840
00:37:42,721 --> 00:37:44,122
at Yuanjing Pavilion.

841
00:37:44,176 --> 00:37:45,200
Someone tried to kill you?

842
00:37:45,321 --> 00:37:46,721
Who would do such a thing?

843
00:37:48,962 --> 00:37:50,082
Mistress Qiao.

844
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:53,681
You must not tell anyone

845
00:37:53,801 --> 00:37:55,761
about what I just said.

846
00:37:56,761 --> 00:37:58,241
Grandma asked,

847
00:37:58,482 --> 00:37:59,922
but I didn't tell her.

848
00:38:00,161 --> 00:38:01,721
Mistress Qiao would go as far as

849
00:38:01,801 --> 00:38:02,841
taking your life?

850
00:38:03,122 --> 00:38:04,761
Nothing she does

851
00:38:05,161 --> 00:38:06,721
will surprise me again.

852
00:38:08,801 --> 00:38:10,321
Any news from Qing Qu?

853
00:38:10,602 --> 00:38:12,161
Qing Qu found Physician Meng.

854
00:38:12,281 --> 00:38:13,882
They will convince him to testify.

855
00:38:13,962 --> 00:38:14,801
If we must,

856
00:38:14,922 --> 00:38:16,122
we'll abduct him.

857
00:38:16,321 --> 00:38:17,562
Young Lady, you can always

858
00:38:17,681 --> 00:38:18,602
count on Qing Qu.

859
00:38:20,002 --> 00:38:20,801
Xue Zhi.

860
00:38:21,522 --> 00:38:22,882
Go to my mother

861
00:38:23,002 --> 00:38:25,201
and ask for a few witty servants.

862
00:38:25,721 --> 00:38:27,522
Tell them to keep an eye
on Bilian Pavilion,

863
00:38:27,801 --> 00:38:29,161
especially Bi Yi.

864
00:38:29,761 --> 00:38:31,201
Young Lady, what's the play here?

865
00:38:32,882 --> 00:38:33,841
I just told Mistress Qiao

866
00:38:34,201 --> 00:38:36,281
that I knew

867
00:38:37,002 --> 00:38:38,482
she sent those assassins

868
00:38:38,602 --> 00:38:39,801
to take my life.

869
00:38:41,482 --> 00:38:44,522
What is the worst fear
for someone who has

870
00:38:45,721 --> 00:38:47,281
committed a heinous crime?

871
00:38:47,801 --> 00:38:49,602
She fears we might track down

872
00:38:49,721 --> 00:38:50,522
the killers she hired

873
00:38:50,641 --> 00:38:52,361
and use them as evidence
to bring her down.

874
00:38:55,630 --> 00:38:57,281
I want to lure the snake out.

875
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:58,561
Understood.

876
00:38:58,801 --> 00:39:00,522
Young Lady, I should get you

877
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,600
some balm for the cut.

878
00:39:01,761 --> 00:39:02,641
Never mind.

879
00:39:03,801 --> 00:39:05,002
This cut will heal

880
00:39:05,122 --> 00:39:06,801
in a matter of days.

881
00:39:07,882 --> 00:39:09,321
I am tired.

882
00:39:09,442 --> 00:39:10,402
Go and see if

883
00:39:10,522 --> 00:39:11,082
Grandma

884
00:39:11,201 --> 00:39:12,442
needs anything.

885
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:14,161
And inform me at once.

886
00:39:29,122 --> 00:39:29,882
Who's there?

887
00:39:29,968 --> 00:39:31,376
(Yao Zhinian)
What do you want?

888
00:39:31,424 --> 00:39:32,360
Who are you people?

889
00:39:32,432 --> 00:39:33,264
(Lu Jiaxue)
Let me go!

890
00:39:33,281 --> 00:39:34,281
What do you want?

891
00:39:34,352 --> 00:39:35,440
(Cao Ping)
What do you want?

892
00:39:35,801 --> 00:39:36,681
What do you want?

893
00:39:36,748 --> 00:39:37,508
(Lin Sheng)

894
00:39:37,509 --> 00:39:38,094
(Bai Meng)

895
00:39:44,122 --> 00:39:46,522
Currently, there are five people

896
00:39:47,522 --> 00:39:49,482
with enough power to command

897
00:39:49,641 --> 00:39:50,841
the Imperial Guards.

898
00:39:50,922 --> 00:39:52,281
Who did you meet

899
00:39:52,402 --> 00:39:54,002
at Yuanjing Pavilion?

900
00:40:00,882 --> 00:40:02,281
Was it Yao Zhinian?

901
00:40:04,201 --> 00:40:05,522
Or perhaps...

902
00:40:09,761 --> 00:40:10,457
Was it Lin Sheng?

903
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:10,921
Why you...

904
00:40:11,082 --> 00:40:12,442
I'll make you pay

905
00:40:12,482 --> 00:40:14,002
when I make you my prisoner!

906
00:40:15,841 --> 00:40:18,002
You framed Vice Minister Chen.

907
00:40:19,321 --> 00:40:21,522
I doubt you've experienced the suffering

908
00:40:23,522 --> 00:40:25,321
he went through.

909
00:40:26,042 --> 00:40:28,681
Chen Jiuheng?

910
00:40:29,082 --> 00:40:30,641
Who was he to you?

911
00:40:36,361 --> 00:40:37,442
I get it now.

912
00:40:37,641 --> 00:40:39,402
Making me a wanted fugitive,

913
00:40:39,602 --> 00:40:40,402
capturing

914
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,319
and releasing me

915
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,199
was your doing.

916
00:40:42,721 --> 00:40:44,641
You were using me as bait

917
00:40:45,002 --> 00:40:46,681
to find the mastermind

918
00:40:46,801 --> 00:40:48,042
of Chen Jiuheng's case.

919
00:40:52,321 --> 00:40:54,002
You realized it before it was too late.

920
00:40:54,562 --> 00:40:56,482
Life or death?

921
00:40:57,361 --> 00:40:58,801
It's up to you to decide.

922
00:40:58,882 --> 00:40:59,641
Sir!

923
00:41:01,241 --> 00:41:02,882
I am only a lapdog.

924
00:41:03,442 --> 00:41:04,361
Spare me.

925
00:41:04,641 --> 00:41:06,361
I'll tell you everything I know.

926
00:41:07,721 --> 00:41:08,482
Sir!

927
00:41:10,002 --> 00:41:11,082
Have mercy, sir.

928
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:12,841
Who were you meeting?

929
00:41:12,962 --> 00:41:14,122
Lu Jiaxue!

930
00:41:16,882 --> 00:41:18,321
I was meeting with Lu Jiaxue.

931
00:41:18,442 --> 00:41:20,161
I knew it.

932
00:41:20,761 --> 00:41:22,082
But Lu Jiaxue

933
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,240
was only a nobody

934
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,519
all those years ago.

935
00:41:25,641 --> 00:41:26,882
Why were you meeting him?

936
00:41:27,002 --> 00:41:28,361
Yes.

937
00:41:28,841 --> 00:41:29,482
Sir,

938
00:41:29,602 --> 00:41:30,962
Sun Chengwu and I

939
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:32,482
both worked for

940
00:41:32,482 --> 00:41:33,602
Governor Song Yingshan.

941
00:41:34,002 --> 00:41:34,882
But later on,

942
00:41:35,402 --> 00:41:36,402
Chen Jiuheng found out

943
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,759
we were smuggling tea leaves.

944
00:41:37,962 --> 00:41:39,042
Lu Jiaxue,

945
00:41:40,002 --> 00:41:41,482
despite his low rank,

946
00:41:41,721 --> 00:41:43,962
secretly proposed a plan
to Song Yingshan.

947
00:41:44,681 --> 00:41:45,562
And then,

948
00:41:45,648 --> 00:41:48,176
Chen Jiuheng was sent to the south
of Yangtze River for disaster relief.

949
00:41:48,176 --> 00:41:50,040
Those people in high places set him up

950
00:41:50,122 --> 00:41:51,681
and framed him for corruption.

951
00:41:54,241 --> 00:41:55,562
Those people?

952
00:41:55,792 --> 00:41:57,240
Aside from Song Yingshan and Lu Jiaxue,

953
00:41:57,361 --> 00:41:58,281
who else was involved?

954
00:41:58,442 --> 00:41:59,082
Sir.

955
00:41:59,801 --> 00:42:01,082
I know nothing about the dealings

956
00:42:01,201 --> 00:42:02,681
between those people.

957
00:42:04,201 --> 00:42:04,962
The ledger.

958
00:42:07,882 --> 00:42:09,201
What about the ledger?

959
00:42:09,602 --> 00:42:11,361
This is the secret ledger

960
00:42:11,442 --> 00:42:12,882
I hid away.

961
00:42:13,161 --> 00:42:14,679
All of Song Yingshan's transactions

962
00:42:14,841 --> 00:42:15,962
were recorded in this.

963
00:42:16,361 --> 00:42:17,201
Sir,

964
00:42:17,641 --> 00:42:19,321
the ledger is encrypted.

965
00:42:19,482 --> 00:42:21,122
As for who the money went to,

966
00:42:21,721 --> 00:42:23,002
I have no idea.

967
00:42:25,321 --> 00:42:25,962
Yes.

968
00:42:26,241 --> 00:42:27,042
Lu Jiaxue!

969
00:42:27,161 --> 00:42:28,761
Lu Jiaxue can decrypt this.

970
00:42:33,281 --> 00:42:34,681
Back at Yuanjing Pavilion,

971
00:42:35,201 --> 00:42:36,761
what else did Lu Jiaxue tell you?

972
00:42:36,841 --> 00:42:37,922
Sun Chengwu left a testimony

973
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,639
at Imperial Court of Judicial.

974
00:42:40,042 --> 00:42:41,679
The place was burned down in a fire,

975
00:42:41,922 --> 00:42:43,042
but I think

976
00:42:43,241 --> 00:42:43,882
the testimony

977
00:42:43,921 --> 00:42:45,080
must have somehow existed.

978
00:42:45,281 --> 00:42:46,721
How can you be so sure?

979
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,080
I had dealings with then-Minister

980
00:42:48,201 --> 00:42:49,442
of Imperial Court named Luo.

981
00:42:49,602 --> 00:42:51,161
He had a bad temper and was stubborn.

982
00:42:51,321 --> 00:42:52,522
Otherwise, he wouldn't have been

983
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:53,881
forced to resign.

984
00:42:54,201 --> 00:42:54,922
Sir.

985
00:42:55,402 --> 00:42:56,962
I've told you everything I know.

986
00:42:57,122 --> 00:42:58,042
Have mercy.

987
00:43:00,562 --> 00:43:01,761
We only know

988
00:43:01,922 --> 00:43:03,882
the former Governor
of the National Army,

989
00:43:04,002 --> 00:43:04,882
Song Yingshan,

990
00:43:05,122 --> 00:43:06,641
and the current Marquis Anbei Lu Jiaxue,

991
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:08,021
were all involved.

992
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:09,120
Li Yinglong and Sun Chengwu

993
00:43:09,241 --> 00:43:10,281
were insignificant.

994
00:43:12,641 --> 00:43:13,681
Three months ago,

995
00:43:13,761 --> 00:43:15,522
Song Yingshan's
whole family was charged.

996
00:43:15,761 --> 00:43:16,641
Song Yingshan

997
00:43:16,922 --> 00:43:18,321
died in prison.

998
00:43:18,402 --> 00:43:19,841
It was Lu Jiaxue who reported

999
00:43:19,922 --> 00:43:20,681
Song Yingshan's

1000
00:43:20,801 --> 00:43:21,681
ten major crimes.

1001
00:43:21,761 --> 00:43:22,482
Lu Jiaxue

1002
00:43:22,602 --> 00:43:23,442
was even engaged

1003
00:43:23,488 --> 00:43:24,352
to his granddaughter.

1004
00:43:24,384 --> 00:43:25,040
And soon enough,

1005
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:26,240
he's standing on his corpse.

1006
00:43:26,272 --> 00:43:27,240
He is definitely

1007
00:43:27,321 --> 00:43:28,482
cruel and vile.

1008
00:43:29,161 --> 00:43:30,562
Who is backing up

1009
00:43:30,681 --> 00:43:31,922
Lu Jiaxue?

1010
00:43:33,082 --> 00:43:34,442
Whoever it is, their position

1011
00:43:34,522 --> 00:43:36,361
must be higher than Song Yingshan.

1012
00:43:36,522 --> 00:43:37,321
A position

1013
00:43:37,402 --> 00:43:38,602
even Lu Jiaxue can't thwart,

1014
00:43:38,681 --> 00:43:40,801
it's someone he must rely on

1015
00:43:41,122 --> 00:43:42,281
and serve.

1016
00:43:42,721 --> 00:43:44,002
Song Yingshan is dead.

1017
00:43:44,522 --> 00:43:46,241
Whoever is backing up Lu Jiaxue,

1018
00:43:46,321 --> 00:43:47,681
we must find them.

1019
00:43:48,402 --> 00:43:49,641
The attack in Yuanjing Pavilion

1020
00:43:50,082 --> 00:43:52,002
must have alerted Lu Jiaxue.

1021
00:43:52,321 --> 00:43:53,402
Keep a low profile

1022
00:43:53,641 --> 00:43:55,122
when you operate.

1023
00:43:55,962 --> 00:43:56,761
Understood.

1024
00:43:57,641 --> 00:43:59,801
What is your plan, Young Master?

1025
00:44:00,161 --> 00:44:02,042
Lu Jiaxue knows the testimony

1026
00:44:02,122 --> 00:44:03,361
is kept in the Luo's Residence.

1027
00:44:03,482 --> 00:44:05,361
We must find it

1028
00:44:05,641 --> 00:44:06,882
before he does.

1029
00:44:07,161 --> 00:44:09,161
With the ledger and the testimony,

1030
00:44:09,241 --> 00:44:10,562
we will have a better chance

1031
00:44:10,922 --> 00:44:12,281
of winning.

1032
00:44:12,361 --> 00:44:13,962
But we haven't found Seventh Lady's

1033
00:44:14,042 --> 00:44:14,882
testimony.

1034
00:44:14,962 --> 00:44:17,402
It's likely with Old Madam Luo.

1035
00:44:20,193 --> 00:44:21,834
She is bedridden.

1036
00:44:23,082 --> 00:44:25,122
