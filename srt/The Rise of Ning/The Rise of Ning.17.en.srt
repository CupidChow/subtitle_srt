=The Rise of Ning=

2
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,320
(Adapted from Wen Tan's novel "Chancellor
Training Handbook" from Jinjiang Literature)

3
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:38,700
=Episode 17=

4
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,879
You want him
to join our family register?

5
00:01:42,096 --> 00:01:43,840
And, you want to put him
under your family?

6
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:45,480
Have you lost your mind?

7
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,776
You admitted in public
that he was the third son

8
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:49,504
of the Luo's Residence
during Literary Feast.

9
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,080
Don't tell me
you'll go against your word?

10
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:51,879
And, he's a student

11
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:53,760
of Mr. Sun right now.

12
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:57,280
I was forced to do so back then.

13
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:58,480
Besides,

14
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,464
Mr. Sun values the Luo Family.

15
00:02:00,512 --> 00:02:02,000
He might not value him as an individual.

16
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,230
Yuan is talented, and Mr. Sun
appreciates talented individuals.

17
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:05,679
He won't go against his words.

18
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,480
Hold it right there.

19
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:07,959
Regarding this matter,

20
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:09,640
there's no room for negotiation.

21
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,160
I'd never agree to it

22
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,360
even if my mother was here.

23
00:02:16,279 --> 00:02:17,080
Someone!

24
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:19,880
Second Master.

25
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,999
Tell Luo Shenyuan

26
00:02:21,999 --> 00:02:22,999
to come here.

27
00:02:22,999 --> 00:02:24,080
I wish to ask him

28
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,719
when he developed

29
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,679
such unwarranted thoughts.

30
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:29,200
Second Master.

31
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,239
Second Master.

32
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,024
Mr. Sun Jie is here
to visit the residence.

33
00:02:33,056 --> 00:02:35,240
Official Jiang of Imperial Court
of Judicial is also here.

34
00:02:37,799 --> 00:02:38,839
What are they doing here?

35
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,160
Second Master,
you should welcome.

36
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,440
Third Young Master is already...

37
00:02:41,456 --> 00:02:42,390
I'll talk to you later.

38
00:02:42,399 --> 00:02:42,999
Let's go.

39
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,239
Mr. Sun, Jiang Nian,

40
00:02:50,839 --> 00:02:52,040
what brings you two here

41
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,480
today?

42
00:02:55,399 --> 00:02:57,040
Official Jiang is in a great mood today.

43
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,760
He insisted on bringing me here

44
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:01,080
to congratulate you, Official Luo.

45
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,760
What's worth celebrating today?

46
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,279
A few days ago, His Majesty

47
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,320
suddenly asked me about

48
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,584
several doubtful points
in the laws of the previous dynasty.

49
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,959
I couldn't answer him.

50
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,320
I sought Mr. Sun's help

51
00:03:13,839 --> 00:03:15,999
in a desperate attempt.

52
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,959
Unfortunately, Mr. Sun wasn't home.

53
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:20,719
Luckily, Yuan was there to help me out.

54
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:24,519
He even organized a set of scrolls
for me.

55
00:03:25,279 --> 00:03:26,880
Yuan helped you out?

56
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,799
Jiang Nian, please pardon him.

57
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,760
He's still young.

58
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,160
He doesn't know his place yet.

59
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,440
What gives you the right

60
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,480
to interfere with court affairs?

61
00:03:39,999 --> 00:03:40,839
Official Luo,

62
00:03:40,999 --> 00:03:41,999
I've read the article

63
00:03:41,999 --> 00:03:43,200
written by Shenyuan.

64
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,360
It was very thorough.

65
00:03:44,679 --> 00:03:45,920
It was appropriate.

66
00:03:45,999 --> 00:03:47,679
It's more than that.

67
00:03:47,679 --> 00:03:49,360
His Majesty even praised me

68
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,799
when I gave him the answer
in court today.

69
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:53,320
I dare not claim credit for that.

70
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,160
Mr. Sun had nurtured
an excellent student.

71
00:03:56,679 --> 00:03:57,480
Luo,

72
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,839
you have an excellent son.

73
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,160
I merely read some books

74
00:04:04,399 --> 00:04:05,279
and vaguely remember

75
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:06,999
some of their content.

76
00:04:07,679 --> 00:04:08,839
You flatter me.

77
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,160
You're fortunate
to have a child like him.

78
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:12,519
Luo,

79
00:04:12,839 --> 00:04:13,679
Yuan has

80
00:04:13,679 --> 00:04:15,959
a bright future ahead of him.

81
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,680
Jiang Nian,

82
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:20,240
he doesn't deserve this flattery.

83
00:04:20,912 --> 00:04:23,000
Who said my student
doesn't deserve such flattery?

84
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:25,880
Shenyuan,

85
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,830
the imperial examination is nearing.

86
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:28,839
You mustn't

87
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:30,159
let me down.

88
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,359
Luo Shenyuan, you're something else.

89
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,839
You brought my superior

90
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:50,479
and Mr. Sun to my residence.

91
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,831
What exactly are you up to?

92
00:04:52,832 --> 00:04:54,510
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

93
00:04:54,512 --> 00:04:55,440
Stop pretending.

94
00:04:56,944 --> 00:04:59,150
If you don't want to include me
in your family register,

95
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:01,320
I won't force you to do so.

96
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:05,240
You've grown smart, huh?

97
00:05:06,064 --> 00:05:07,830
You're making advances
by taking a step back.

98
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,120
If I don't include you
in our family register,

99
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,192
you won't be able
to take the imperial examination.

100
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:13,200
By then,

101
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,959
I have no way to face Mr. Sun.

102
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,599
The entire capital will think of me

103
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,479
as a narrow-minded person
who mistreats his family

104
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,800
instead of a benevolent father.

105
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:26,719
You're overthinking it.

106
00:05:27,776 --> 00:05:29,800
You weren't a benevolent father
in the first place.

107
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,000
I shouldn't have kept you

108
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,399
in the residence back then.

109
00:05:34,399 --> 00:05:35,320
It's not too late for you

110
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,159
to chase me out now.

111
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:37,320
Are you threatening me?

112
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,120
That's not it.

113
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:40,048
But I can't help it

114
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:41,159
if you feel that way.

115
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,159
I have something else to do.

116
00:05:43,839 --> 00:05:45,080
I'll take my leave first.

117
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:46,719
By the way, let me tell you this.

118
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:50,359
Mr. Sun wants me to do my homework
at his place.

119
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:55,640
Stop right there!

120
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,440
I haven't finished my words yet!

121
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,719
Why are you angry?

122
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:12,839
Mother.

123
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,919
I saw Shenyuan just now.

124
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,320
Chengzhang,

125
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,479
all these years,

126
00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:27,839
you've never fulfilled your duties

127
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,519
as a father.

128
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,959
It's natural for your child

129
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,959
to be distant from you.

130
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,440
It's more than that.

131
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,519
He's downright being defiant.

132
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:39,640
Defiant?

133
00:06:41,456 --> 00:06:43,510
Does that mean
you're acknowledging him as your son?

134
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:47,080
Forget it. So many years
have passed since then.

135
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,479
There's no way to make amends for it.

136
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,200
My son, you should let it go.

137
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:53,560
Just let it go.

138
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,080
That child

139
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,120
will attend
the imperial examination soon.

140
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:02,519
He can only

141
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,240
attend it as a son

142
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:05,760
of the Luo Family.

143
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:07,159
And,

144
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,519
he can only attend it

145
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:10,479
as the legitimate son
of your second wife.

146
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,000
Mother,

147
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,856
I'm already showing him respect

148
00:07:13,872 --> 00:07:15,510
by allowing him
to join our family register.

149
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:16,760
Why must we make him

150
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:18,519
my legitimate son as well?

151
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:21,240
He has to be your legitimate son.

152
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,800
Only then will people not gossip about
his identity.

153
00:07:25,856 --> 00:07:29,240
Only then will he be a true member
of the Luo Family.

154
00:07:30,359 --> 00:07:31,320
I know.

155
00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:33,200
You dislike him.

156
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:36,359
But you're the head of the Luo Family.

157
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:38,719
You have to look at the bigger picture

158
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:40,680
and prioritize the family,

159
00:07:40,719 --> 00:07:41,519
understood?

160
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,240
I saw what you did as well.
All these years,

161
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:48,320
you've entrusted all your hopes

162
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,800
on Xuan

163
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,872
for him to restore the Luo Family
to its former glory.

164
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,000
But you witnessed

165
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,599
Xuan's performance

166
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,039
on the Literary Feast yourself.

167
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,800
Do you think he can lead

168
00:07:57,839 --> 00:07:59,680
the Luo Family by himself?

169
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,800
Mother, I've let you down.

170
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,080
I'm not trying to blame you here.

171
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,959
I just want you to know this.

172
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,240
Regarding the current situation
of the Luo Family,

173
00:08:14,624 --> 00:08:16,080
I think you should take some time

174
00:08:16,159 --> 00:08:18,159
to ponder upon it.

175
00:08:20,159 --> 00:08:22,560
All right. I'll stop bothering you.

176
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,829
(Muxi Hall)

177
00:09:00,359 --> 00:09:02,400
Tell Shenyuan to come here.

178
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,119
Old Madam,

179
00:09:04,288 --> 00:09:06,512
do you plan to acknowledge him
as a member of the family?

180
00:09:06,599 --> 00:09:08,359
That document is here with us.

181
00:09:09,359 --> 00:09:10,239
It's inseparable

182
00:09:10,239 --> 00:09:12,200
from the Luo Family.

183
00:09:12,384 --> 00:09:14,990
I just hope that he can join
our family register as soon as possible.

184
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,160
This way, the rise and fall
of the Luo Family

185
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,520
will be tied to him.

186
00:09:19,599 --> 00:09:20,839
If that's the case,

187
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,280
he'll have to make
his decisions more carefully.

188
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:24,959
With Seventh Lady around,

189
00:09:25,119 --> 00:09:26,800
he'll have to look after her

190
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,200
even if he doesn't intend
to look after the family.

191
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,920
Yining is

192
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,879
a worrisome child from the start.

193
00:09:35,119 --> 00:09:36,839
It's good that there's someone else

194
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,719
who can look after her now.

195
00:09:39,119 --> 00:09:39,920
Yes, Old Madam.

196
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,320
Old Madam.

197
00:09:48,119 --> 00:09:48,680
Old Madam.

198
00:09:53,999 --> 00:09:55,400
Mr. Sun told me

199
00:09:55,959 --> 00:09:57,879
that your character and aspirations

200
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,680
are the same

201
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,599
as your grandfather, Wenzhai.

202
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:04,999
It's tied

203
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,280
to the Luo Family's glory.

204
00:10:07,616 --> 00:10:09,200
However, it's also tied to its demise.

205
00:10:09,599 --> 00:10:11,879
His character was also the reason

206
00:10:12,119 --> 00:10:15,959
behind the fall of our glorious family.

207
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,200
But Old Madam,
you're still preserving

208
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,479
Old Master's last wish.

209
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,719
His character was also the reason

210
00:10:21,728 --> 00:10:23,040
behind the family's glory and fame,

211
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,110
which lasted for a century.

212
00:10:24,479 --> 00:10:26,599
Loss is merely temporary.

213
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:29,320
However, glory will persist
as long as the character persists.

214
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,879
Have you discussed this
with your father?

215
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:41,879
Yes, I have.

216
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,280
I assume he can't show off his wittiness
in front of you.

217
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,520
From now on, you'll be
a legitimate son of the Luo Family.

218
00:10:49,999 --> 00:10:51,639
But you must remember this.

219
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,639
He'll always be your father.

220
00:10:55,599 --> 00:10:56,359
Understood.

221
00:10:59,160 --> 00:10:59,999
Old Madam.

222
00:11:01,599 --> 00:11:03,440
I know what you're trying to say.

223
00:11:03,759 --> 00:11:04,959
If you're able

224
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,520
to read that document in the future,

225
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,200
you'll know why

226
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,920
I can't hand it to you today.

227
00:11:12,719 --> 00:11:14,879
Go now. Go and get changed.

228
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,440
I've prepared a banquet for you.

229
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:18,759
Yes, Old Madam.

230
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:21,999
Yes,

231
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:23,920
Grandma.

232
00:11:37,252 --> 00:11:40,883

233
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:47,839
Mother.

234
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:48,359
Have a seat.

235
00:11:48,359 --> 00:11:49,320
- Grandma.
- Mother.

236
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:49,759
Have a seat.

237
00:11:49,759 --> 00:11:50,400
Grandma.

238
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,920
Shenyuan, come and take your seat.

239
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:15,160
Grandma.

240
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:16,999
Take your seat.

241
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,080
Yes, Grandma.

242
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,520
Third Brother, you should sit here.

243
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,040
It's closer to Mother.

244
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,839
This is a family banquet.

245
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,320
What is he doing here?

246
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,719
I'm holding this family banquet

247
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,119
because I have something to announce.

248
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,719
Shenyuan will join our family register.

249
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,040
He shall be placed under
the care of the second wife.

250
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:44,119
In the future, he'll be
a legitimate son of the second wife.

251
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:44,800
This is great!

252
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,440
From now on,

253
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,920
you'll be my third nephew officially.

254
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,479
Congratulations, Shenyuan.

255
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:54,719
Thank you, Yiyu.

256
00:12:57,696 --> 00:12:58,950
Since you've already joined

257
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:00,280
Mr. Sun's academy,

258
00:13:00,599 --> 00:13:01,920
you have to work even harder.

259
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,999
You mustn't embarrass our family.

260
00:13:04,359 --> 00:13:05,239
Yes, Father.

261
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:08,400
Let's eat.

262
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,160
These are the signature dishes
of our cook.

263
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,239
You should eat up.

264
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,520
Thank you, Madam Lin.

265
00:13:15,599 --> 00:13:17,759
Third Brother, you should
change the way you address her.

266
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:22,839
Thank you, Mother.

267
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,239
Here, my son.

268
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,320
You're too thin. You should eat more.

269
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:34,759
Thank you, Mother.

270
00:13:45,479 --> 00:13:47,080
Shao'an, take a close look.

271
00:13:48,479 --> 00:13:49,080
Over there.

272
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,759
Move the bun slightly to the left.

273
00:13:50,839 --> 00:13:52,719
It's still crooked.

274
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:53,599
You should

275
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:54,800
move it slightly to the left.

276
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,839
It's crooked.

277
00:13:58,839 --> 00:13:59,680
Take a close look.

278
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,160
Can't you tell?

279
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:03,119
Xue Zhi, comb his hair for him.

280
00:14:03,479 --> 00:14:04,119
Yes.

281
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,160
This crown symbolizes
purity and nobility.

282
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,040
Third Brother, may you always
retain your original intention,

283
00:14:25,184 --> 00:14:26,590
maintain a clear mind and pure heart,

284
00:14:28,359 --> 00:14:29,800
and remain steadfast on the right path.

285
00:14:33,792 --> 00:14:35,680
The belt is adorned
with a buckle of good luck.

286
00:14:35,999 --> 00:14:37,479
I sewed it on myself.

287
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:40,479
Third Brother,
may you have a peaceful life,

288
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:41,680

00:20:11,199 --> 00:20:12,000
Qing Qu,

372
00:20:12,016 --> 00:20:13,590
deliver the gifts
I prepared for Ms. Cheng

373
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:15,080
to her carriage.

374
00:20:15,696 --> 00:20:17,320
Young Lady, please take care of yourself

375
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,439
after my departure.

376
00:20:20,199 --> 00:20:21,839
I can't bear to part with you either.

377
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:23,320
But even if I stay here,

378
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:25,679
it won't bring you any benefits.

379
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:26,199
Instead...

380
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:32,320
Young Lady, in the future,

381
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:33,800
you can tell Qing Qu to write to me

382
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,679
if you need anything,

383
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:36,439
okay?

384
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,879
This must be Third Young Master Luo.

385
00:20:47,839 --> 00:20:48,679
Ms. Zheng.

386
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,599
Lately, I've been hearing
that you were close to Young Lady

387
00:20:53,599 --> 00:20:55,679
ever since I arrived
at the Luo's Residence.

388
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,320
Third Young Master,
you've become the legitimate son

389
00:20:58,352 --> 00:21:00,390
of the second wife upon
entering the Ancestral Shrine.

390
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:01,000
From now on,

391
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
you're the backbone of the Luo Family.

392
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:05,159
Now, you're also the brother

393
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,000
of Seventh Lady.

394
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,000
Third Young Master,

395
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,599
let me thank you in advance.

396
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,000
Third Young Master,

397
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:18,280
please look after
Seventh Lady in the future.

398
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:20,879
Ms. Zheng, please don't worry.

399
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:22,879
Ms. Zheng,

400
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,320
you must look after yourself.

401
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:48,679
Ms. Zheng

402
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,439
is loyal to you indeed.

403
00:21:52,399 --> 00:21:53,199
It's a shame

404
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,760
that she's not willing to tell me

405
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:57,000
why she left suddenly

406
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,320
after

407
00:21:58,599 --> 00:21:59,919
my mother's passing.

408
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:02,679
Maybe

409
00:22:03,399 --> 00:22:05,320
she has some bitter reasons.

410
00:22:11,244 --> 00:22:12,838
(Wonton)

411
00:22:15,616 --> 00:22:16,544
Young Lady.

412
00:22:16,928 --> 00:22:18,208
What would you like to order?

413
00:22:18,439 --> 00:22:20,359
Young Lady, are you not done yet?

414
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,760
Jimo House

415
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,199
was too plain in the past.

416
00:22:23,199 --> 00:22:24,520
Now, times have changed.

417
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:25,520
Mother also said

418
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,910
it's time to buy something for him.

419
00:22:26,944 --> 00:22:29,000
Even so, you don't need
to do it yourself, Young Lady.

420
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,439
Just leave it to us.

421
00:22:30,848 --> 00:22:32,240
I spend so much time in the residence

422
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,480
that I'm getting so bored of it.

423
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,439
Auspicious shops for rent!

424
00:22:34,439 --> 00:22:35,320
Come and take a look!

425
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,199
Auspicious shops!

426
00:22:36,199 --> 00:22:37,599
Its location is great!

427
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,624
Let's go and take a look.

428
00:22:38,639 --> 00:22:38,960
Okay.

429
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:40,119
Come and take a look!

430
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:41,960
Auspicious shops for rent!

431
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:42,919
Come and take a look!

432
00:22:42,948 --> 00:22:43,635
(Changqing House)

433
00:22:44,359 --> 00:22:45,189
Mister,

434
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:46,336
which location

435
00:22:46,336 --> 00:22:47,720
were you referring to just now?

436
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,639
Young Lady, are you looking for a shop?

437
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,679
I'm not planning to open a tavern.

438
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,240
It's convenient for it

439
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,440
to be located near the street.

440
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:57,560
Whether it's close
to the river or not doesn't matter.

441
00:22:57,568 --> 00:22:58,480
But I think

442
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,040
this street is very lively.

443
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,280
A shop located here

444
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,679
would've been rented out by now.

445
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:03,679
What a coincidence.

446
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:04,669
It's the shop I mentioned.

447
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:06,480
It's right next to the river
and near the street.

448
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,520
If you do like it,

449
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,760
I'll rent it to you for this price.

450
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,144
It's the lowest rent in town!

451
00:23:17,439 --> 00:23:18,439
You mean this?

452
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,040
That's right. Let me show you around.

453
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,240
They sell incense and candles next door.

454
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,839
And, there's a sharp corner there.

455
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:25,760
It doesn't look like a nice place.

456
00:23:27,216 --> 00:23:27,824
Young Lady...

457
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:31,879
Mister, give me this.

458
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:32,416
All right.

459
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:33,150
A little more.

460
00:23:34,639 --> 00:23:35,919
What have you guys bought?

461
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:36,679
Yining?

462
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:38,080
How did you guys manage to sneak out?

463
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,960
Mother has been monitoring
Shan's study closely.

464
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,839
She had no time for me.

465
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:42,000
So I snuck out of the residence.

466
00:23:42,199 --> 00:23:43,040
Yining,

467
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:44,189
I saw you checking out a shop.

468
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:44,889
Please remember me

469
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,000
if you intend to do business.

470
00:23:46,439 --> 00:23:48,040
I was just taking a casual look.

471
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:49,040
Why don't we

472
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,280
have a meal together later?

473
00:23:50,439 --> 00:23:51,439
They literally

474
00:23:51,439 --> 00:23:52,520
have their hands full now.

475
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:53,839
We have to return first.

476
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,159
All right. You can go ahead.

477
00:23:55,159 --> 00:23:56,240
You guys can continue, then.

478
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,800
What's the matter?

479
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,760
Yining

480
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,439
was always witty and self-assured.

481
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,936
Since she was chatting with
that guy,

482
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:09,430
she wanted to do business in the future.

483
00:24:10,679 --> 00:24:12,280
But she's a girl.

484
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,960
How could she do business?

485
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,240
I can act as her figurehead.

486
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,320
By then, she and I

487
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,289
can do business together.

488
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:18,000
And we'll take you.

489
00:24:18,439 --> 00:24:19,760
I don't have that much money.

490
00:24:19,936 --> 00:24:21,430
You can contribute through effort, then.

491
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,000
All right.

492
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,080
Let's go and have a meal.

493
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:24,839
I'm starving.

494
00:24:26,639 --> 00:24:27,240
Let's go.

495
00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:34,800
Young Lady, were you sincere

496
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,280
in looking for a shop just now?

497
00:24:37,639 --> 00:24:38,480
Before this,

498
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,520
I've been learning bookkeeping
from Mother

499
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:42,359
so that I could make a living by myself

500
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,119
in the future.

501
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:45,119
Young Lady,

502
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:46,320
how can girls like us

503
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,280
do business by ourselves?

504
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,520
Moreover, the Luo Family
is also a scholarly household.

505
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:50,879
People from the officialdom

506
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,919
had always despised merchants.

507
00:24:53,439 --> 00:24:54,679
Noble families like ours

508
00:24:54,679 --> 00:24:55,399
won't do business

509
00:24:55,399 --> 00:24:56,679
using their own names usually.

510
00:24:57,119 --> 00:24:59,119
They should have someone
backing them up.

511
00:24:59,399 --> 00:25:00,119
However,

512
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:01,960
what should we do about
the exorbitant expenses

513
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,000
of the family?

514
00:25:04,359 --> 00:25:06,439
I wish to make a living by myself.

515
00:25:06,439 --> 00:25:07,800
There's nothing embarrassing about it.

516
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:09,399
However, you guys are right.

517
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,199
I should find someone

518
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,159
who can back me up.

519
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,760
If so, don't you think Sixth Master Lin

520
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,080
is our best candidate?

521
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,040
That's right.

522
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,639
The rouge, Baihua Ointment,

523
00:25:17,639 --> 00:25:18,720
and wound medicine he makes

524
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,000
are more popular than the products

525
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,919
sold in the capital.

526
00:25:20,944 --> 00:25:22,110
All of the maidservants here

527
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:23,776
spend their monthly wages
on his products.

528
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:25,639
He won't do.

529
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:27,320
Mother is worried about his result

530
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,599
in the imperial examination.

531
00:25:28,639 --> 00:25:30,839
I mustn't upset her.

532
00:25:32,857 --> 00:25:35,036
(Liuhe Tavern)

533
00:25:45,072 --> 00:25:45,760
Young Master,

534
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,119
we've been waiting here

535
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:48,520
for three days straight.

536
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:50,080
You should at least have something.

537
00:25:50,832 --> 00:25:51,800
I have no appetite.

538
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,240
Waiter, I need a table for two.

539
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,000
Dear guests, please hold on.

540
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,280
Let me inquire about it for you.

541
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:03,879
Sixth Lady?

542
00:26:04,599 --> 00:26:05,359
Mr. Han?

543
00:26:09,472 --> 00:26:10,160
Sixth Lady.

544
00:26:10,224 --> 00:26:10,960
What a coincidence.

545
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,192
Are you here for a meal as well?

546
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,669
Yeah, what a coincidence indeed.

547
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:15,216
What? Come here
just to wait for someone?

548
00:26:15,216 --> 00:26:15,910
That's right.

549
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:17,760
I'm here to wait for Sixth Lady.

550
00:26:19,159 --> 00:26:20,639
Why are you waiting for me?

551
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,639
Dear guests, I'm sorry.

552
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,119
Our tavern is currently full.

553
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:25,000
Why don't you two

554
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,399
sit and wait for a while?

555
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,480
It's fine.

556
00:26:27,639 --> 00:26:28,639
We'll go somewhere else.

557
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:30,280
You two can join my table

558
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,439
if you don't mind.

559
00:26:31,584 --> 00:26:32,080
We don't...

560
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:32,599
We do.

561
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,639
Mr. Han, sorry for the trouble, then.

562
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,800
Not at all.

563
00:26:43,136 --> 00:26:44,480
Sixth Lady, see what you like.

564
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,296
Let me take a look.

565
00:26:46,879 --> 00:26:48,000
I want...

566
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,280
Give me these two dishes.

567
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,080
Please wait a moment.

568
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,159
You're exercising moderation, huh?
You've grown.

569
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,040
Please.

570
00:27:12,599 --> 00:27:13,960
It's crunchy and sweet.

571
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,320
This is smooth and delicious.

572
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:30,520
It's delicious.

573
00:27:32,304 --> 00:27:33,200
It's delicious indeed.

574
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,800
Why are you eating

575
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,960
whatever Sixth Lady is eating?

576
00:27:37,199 --> 00:27:38,399
You're so weird.

577
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,399
I wasn't particularly interested

578
00:27:41,399 --> 00:27:42,760
in food and delicacies since young.

579
00:27:42,768 --> 00:27:44,000
Many physicians had given me

580
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,159
diagnoses but to no avail.

581
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,119
But ever since

582
00:27:46,119 --> 00:27:47,480
I saw Sixth Lady eating,

583
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:48,679
it felt like the food

584
00:27:48,679 --> 00:27:49,960
was fragrant and delicious.

585
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,159
It made them appetizing to me.

586
00:27:52,639 --> 00:27:54,199
Why don't you give Mr. Han

587
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,920
the prescription you gave me before?

588
00:27:55,952 --> 00:27:57,630
You'll have a huge appetite
after taking it.

589
00:27:57,639 --> 00:27:58,679
I already forgot the formula.

590
00:27:59,000 --> 00:27:59,800
You forgot it?

591
00:27:59,904 --> 00:28:01,072
It's fine. I still have some.

592
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:01,968
I'll give it to you.

593
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:03,639
But those are mine.

594
00:28:03,639 --> 00:28:04,280
You gave me.

595
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,280
That makes them mine now.

596
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:05,960
Besides,

597
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:07,480
eating is such a joyful thing.

598
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,256
Wouldn't it be terrible

599
00:28:08,272 --> 00:28:09,430
if you couldn't enjoy eating?

600
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:10,960
Eating is the only thing you know.

601
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,000
You'd cry if you were so fat

602
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,870
that no one married you.

603
00:28:13,399 --> 00:28:14,199
I'll marry her, then.

604
00:28:23,439 --> 00:28:24,679
I'm serious.

605
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,480
I'm not getting married.

606
00:28:30,639 --> 00:28:31,639
Let's eat.

607
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,520
Let's eat. The dishes are getting cold.

608
00:28:35,639 --> 00:28:36,480
Let's eat.

609
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,680
Come on. They're getting cold.

610
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:53,119
Young Master,

611
00:28:53,136 --> 00:28:54,540
Shopkeeper Zheng said you could decide

612
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:55,984
where the apothecary should be located.

613
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,110
Opening an apothecary is
a charity deed in itself.

614
00:28:58,159 --> 00:28:59,919
The free monthly medical clinic
can definitely

615
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:01,280
save the lives of many poor people.

616
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,399
We have to do a good job at this.

617
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:04,599
Understood.

618
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:06,303
(Jimo House)

619
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:12,919
All of these

620
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:14,480
were gifted by Old Madam, Madam Lin,

621
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,960
and Madam Chen.

622
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:16,800
They're treating you

623
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,960
differently ever since you

624
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,520
became the legitimate son.

625
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:21,800
Wrap them up.

626
00:29:22,144 --> 00:29:22,720
Yes, sir.

627
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:27,439
I suppose all of these

628
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,639
are new as well.

629
00:29:29,599 --> 00:29:30,639
The new tea table

630
00:29:30,639 --> 00:29:31,599
and the accessories

631
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:32,639
on the study table

632
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:34,520
were picked by Seventh Lady herself.

633
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,669
You see,

634
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:36,800
the chamber looks much classier

635
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,520
after getting all these new items.

636
00:29:39,599 --> 00:29:41,280
This paperweight is actually a carp.

637
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,679
She hopes that you can
make a great leap forward.

638
00:29:45,136 --> 00:29:46,280
Whether I make the leap or not

639
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,439
doesn't matter to her.

640
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:49,000
I never expected her

641
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,159
to still remember

642
00:29:50,224 --> 00:29:51,920
that I gave her a carp lamp before this.

643
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,800
Young Master, you and Seventh Lady

644
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,879
are siblings as stated

645
00:29:58,879 --> 00:30:00,000
in the family register now.

646
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,040
I'm afraid you two can't...

647
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,639
Young Lady,

648
00:30:21,216 --> 00:30:22,430
you've been at it for some time.

649
00:30:22,439 --> 00:30:23,720
It's time to take a break.

650
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,280
Why don't we seek
Third Young Master's help?

651
00:30:26,736 --> 00:30:28,960
Mr. Sun already summoned
Third Brother to his residence.

652
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,679
It's already taxing enough for him.

653
00:30:31,439 --> 00:30:32,839
This is my own affair to handle.

654
00:30:32,839 --> 00:30:33,760
Yining!

655
00:30:34,679 --> 00:30:35,439
Sixth Uncle?

656
00:30:36,912 --> 00:30:38,432
Sixth Uncle, what are you doing here?

657
00:30:39,456 --> 00:30:40,000
Take a look.

658
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,000
What's this?

659
00:30:41,599 --> 00:30:43,280
These are the rouges,

660
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,512
perfume, and ointment I invented.

661
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,599
Yining,

662
00:30:45,639 --> 00:30:47,439
you must include me
if you plan to do business.

663
00:30:47,664 --> 00:30:49,424
Don't try to brush me off
with jokes again.

664
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:50,760
But Sixth Uncle...

665
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,359
I know.

666
00:30:52,448 --> 00:30:54,192
You'll have reservations
because of my sister.

667
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:56,439
But everyone has
their own purposes in life.

668
00:30:56,919 --> 00:30:58,389
I'm not cut off to be an official.

669
00:30:58,390 --> 00:30:59,872
But when it comes
to inventing these,

670
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,630
no one in the capital is a match for me.

671
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,159
Sixth Uncle, are you not worried about

672
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,848
the pressure that Mother and
the Lin Family

673
00:31:06,912 --> 00:31:07,720
are giving you?

674
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,280
I hated studying and attending

675
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,679
the imperial examination since young.

676
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:11,599
I'm terrible at them too.

677
00:31:11,632 --> 00:31:12,630
If so, why should I bother

678
00:31:12,639 --> 00:31:13,800
competing with others?

679
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:14,839
Anyway,

680
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:15,919
I wish

681
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:17,000
to make a name for myself.

682
00:31:18,439 --> 00:31:19,240
Sixth Uncle,

683
00:31:19,399 --> 00:31:20,520
you really impress me!

684
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,149
You can spare me the flattery.

685
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:23,488
It's more important to do business.

686
00:31:23,504 --> 00:31:25,110
Well, I'll provide these products
while you

687
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:26,368
can provide manpower and money.

688
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:27,790
Let's make a business venture together.

689
00:31:27,879 --> 00:31:28,199
Okay.

690
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:32,280
Take a look.

691
00:31:33,248 --> 00:31:34,040
Guys, please.

692
00:31:38,144 --> 00:31:39,760
My shop is pretty good, don't you think?

693
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:43,879
The location is pretty good.

694
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,399
But regarding the price...

695
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:47,359
My price is definitely fair.

696
00:31:47,879 --> 00:31:49,960
The last tenant who rented my shop

697
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,639
had a booming business for ten years.

698
00:31:51,639 --> 00:31:53,119
He definitely wouldn't give it up

699
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:55,399
if it weren't for the
sudden changes in his family.

700
00:31:56,679 --> 00:31:57,839
This shop of yours

701
00:31:57,839 --> 00:31:58,960
is old and faulty

702
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,040
all because

703
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,408
he rented the place for ten years.

704
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,000
If I do rent it,

705
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,119
I have to renovate it again.

706
00:32:04,304 --> 00:32:06,390
It'll cost 30% of my capital
to renovate the shop alone.

707
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:08,520
I...

708
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,720
Did we go too far?

709
00:32:12,896 --> 00:32:15,280
Our capital is limited. We need
to save as much of it as we can.

710
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:16,839
Mister,

711
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,480
we're sincere

712
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:19,800
in renting your shop.

713
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:21,760
You should give us a discount.

714
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,359
I'll give you at most a 10% discount.

715
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:25,119
A 20% discount.

716
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:26,679
That won't do.

717
00:32:26,839 --> 00:32:27,639
Mister,

718
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,280
look at your shop.

719
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,080
It's huge.

720
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,320
Small business owners

721
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,320
can't afford to rent it.

722
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,679
If you don't rent it to me,

723
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:34,800
you'll incur losses

724
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:36,040
for every vacant day.

725
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,639
If you rent it out early,

726
00:32:37,639 --> 00:32:38,800
you can recover

727
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:39,800
your capital early.

728
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:41,240
You're so persuasive.

729
00:32:42,119 --> 00:32:43,000
What about...

730
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:43,359
If so...

731
00:32:43,359 --> 00:32:44,119
Mister!

732
00:32:45,639 --> 00:32:46,240
Give me a second.

733
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:48,240
You're amazing.

734
00:32:48,272 --> 00:32:50,080
I think we'll be able to rent it
for this price.

735
00:32:50,199 --> 00:32:51,439
You are?

736
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,360
I'm renting the place.

737
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:57,119
Who are you?

738
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:58,839
We should do things in order, you know?

739
00:32:58,960 --> 00:32:59,679
You're too late.

740
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:00,720
We're renting the place.

741
00:33:00,752 --> 00:33:01,456
That's right.

742
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,760
Have you signed the agreement or not?

743
00:33:04,599 --> 00:33:06,960
It doesn't count when
the agreement hasn't been signed.

744
00:33:07,639 --> 00:33:09,000
Mister, let's sign the agreement now.

745
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,439
Mister, I'll pay you an extra 10%

746
00:33:11,439 --> 00:33:12,599
for the price you offered them.

747
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:14,520
Really?

748
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,199
I'm from Longquan Trading House.

749
00:33:17,199 --> 00:33:18,800
I'm renting this place at all costs.

750
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,919
We can negotiate the price.

751
00:33:21,639 --> 00:33:22,439
Please wait a moment.

752
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:24,159
I'll get you the agreement now.

753
00:33:24,656 --> 00:33:26,380
So what if you're from
Longquan Trading House?

754
00:33:26,384 --> 00:33:27,000
Does that mean

755
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,280
you can raise the price arbitrarily

756
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,399
and act unreasonably?

757
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,399
Business is just like war.

758
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,399
Miss, if you plan to be reasonable,

759
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,080
why don't you head home,
focus on needlework,

760
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,520
and get yourself a good husband?

761
00:33:38,439 --> 00:33:38,869
Mister,

762
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:40,528
he's adding an extra 10%
to the rent, right?

763
00:33:40,576 --> 00:33:41,504
I'll increase my price too.

764
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,199
I'll give you an extra 20%.

765
00:33:45,639 --> 00:33:46,639
I'll give you an extra 30%.

766
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,599
An extra 50%!

767
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:51,399
You!

768
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,960
Miss, I'll be honest with you.

769
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,184
I'm down to compete with you

770
00:33:55,184 --> 00:33:56,700
even if you give him
two times the price.

771
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:57,960
Our leader said

772
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,960
we have to rent this place at all costs.

773
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,520
Take a look.

774
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,950
I would've crushed him with my money

775
00:34:03,952 --> 00:34:05,280
if we were in Lin'an.

776
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:08,928
- Shenyuan?
- Third Brother?

777
00:34:09,056 --> 00:34:09,960
What are you doing here?

778
00:34:10,119 --> 00:34:11,319
I was passing by.

779
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:12,960
But there was a commotion.

780
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,960
It sounded like you two.

781
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,360
Third Brother, help us out.

782
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,920
Are you trying to rent this shop?

783
00:34:17,239 --> 00:34:18,040
Shenyuan,

784
00:34:18,048 --> 00:34:18,960
you're very intelligent.

785
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,239
Please be our judge.

786
00:34:20,279 --> 00:34:21,759
We already had a deal before this.

787
00:34:21,792 --> 00:34:23,670
But this man came and raised
the price on purpose.

788
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:24,920
He's such a bully.

789
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,119
So, we confirmed the place first,

790
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:36,440
and you came here
to raise the price on purpose, huh?

791
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,520
That's wrong of you.

792
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,199
I'm only doing this under the order

793
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,279
of our leader.

794
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,960
Third Brother, he said
he was from a place called

795
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,960
Longquan Trading House.

796
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,279
He was showing off just now.

797
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,880
He's from Longquan Trading House, huh?

798
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,040
So what?

799
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:53,159
Longquan Trading House

800
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,520
always abides by the rules.

801
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:56,440
With the way you act,

802
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,599
you'll damage

803
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:59,199
Longquan Trading House's reputation.

804
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,080
Mister, you do have a point.

805
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,119
Miss,

806
00:35:08,679 --> 00:35:09,840
if you guys

807
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,680
are unable to make an offer
higher than his,

808
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,679
you guys should find another shop.

809
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:15,119
We have an agreement to sign.

810
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:16,159
What did he mean by that?

811
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,880
Third Brother, just now,

812
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,440
he raised the price by 50%.

813
00:35:19,719 --> 00:35:20,759
I have no way to afford

814
00:35:20,759 --> 00:35:21,599
that kind of rent.

815
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,040
You raised the price by 50%?

816
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,309
Tell us

817
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:25,344
the kind of dirty business

818
00:35:25,392 --> 00:35:26,416
you're doing

819
00:35:26,448 --> 00:35:27,590
for you to make that much.

820
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:28,840
Mister, you should think twice.

821
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,960
Money doesn't matter here.

822
00:35:29,968 --> 00:35:32,368
But what if you get yourself
involved in a legal case due to this?

823
00:35:33,679 --> 00:35:34,679
You should think twice.

824
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:39,239
I haven't asked you this yet.

825
00:35:39,239 --> 00:35:40,759
What kind of business
do you intend to do

826
00:35:40,759 --> 00:35:41,960
by renting my shop?

827
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:42,799
I plan to...

828
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,199
Why are you stuttering?

829
00:35:50,799 --> 00:35:52,440
Shopkeeper, you see,

830
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:53,840
although we don't have much capital,

831
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,790
at least we're doing

832
00:35:54,799 --> 00:35:56,520
a decent business here.

833
00:35:58,016 --> 00:36:00,304
You're making this
much more troublesome than it should be.

834
00:36:00,336 --> 00:36:01,190
I quit.

835
00:36:02,799 --> 00:36:03,480
Take care.

836
00:36:04,759 --> 00:36:05,159
Mister,

837
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:07,190
let's sign the agreement now.

838
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:08,520
All done!

839
00:36:09,888 --> 00:36:11,480
Third Brother, you're the best indeed.

840
00:36:12,759 --> 00:36:13,199
It's done!

841
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,440
We finally completed the crucial step.

842
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:27,639
From today onward,

843
00:36:27,744 --> 00:36:29,790
you'll be the most popular shop
in the entire capital.

844
00:36:30,279 --> 00:36:32,360
Six Uncle looks so happy.

845
00:36:32,416 --> 00:36:34,016
Third Brother, I didn't expect you

846
00:36:34,096 --> 00:36:35,520
to pass by this place today.

847
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:36,840
Coincidentally,

848
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:37,599
we were discussing

849
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:38,799
whether or not to rent the shop.

850
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,480
Luckily, we managed to rent it

851
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:41,719
through our united effort.

852
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,119
Although you've gotten yourself a shop,

853
00:36:45,679 --> 00:36:47,279
you need to know that doing business

854
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,759
isn't as simple

855
00:36:48,759 --> 00:36:49,599
as you think.

856
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,109
How could it be harder

857
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:54,576
than the things women like us
need to do to survive in this world?

858
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:55,759
I'm not afraid.

859
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:59,943
(Jimo House)

860
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,679
Stop laughing.

861
00:37:12,719 --> 00:37:13,960
What's so funny about it?

862
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,000
You requested Shopkeeper Zheng

863
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,520
to rent the shop at all costs.

864
00:37:17,679 --> 00:37:18,840
But in the end?

865
00:37:19,159 --> 00:37:20,229
You helped Seventh Lady out

866
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:21,760
and damaged your own business instead.

867
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:23,199
So what?

868
00:37:23,799 --> 00:37:24,920
I have my own plans.

869
00:37:25,639 --> 00:37:26,440
Young Master,

870
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,190
why is Seventh Lady
trying to open a shop

871
00:37:28,199 --> 00:37:29,679
out of the blue?

872
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:32,159
She just wants to make a living
by herself in the future

873
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:33,759
without depending on anyone.

874
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,880
She was born into the Luo Family,

875
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,239
a family of officials.

876
00:37:37,319 --> 00:37:38,239
I don't think she needs

877
00:37:38,279 --> 00:37:39,520
to consider an option like this.

878
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,719
She's different from other women.

879
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:50,360
Why are you sighing?

880
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:51,960
Your sighs are turning my hair grey.

881
00:37:52,119 --> 00:37:53,040
From tomorrow onward,

882
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:53,488
no visitors.

883
00:37:53,504 --> 00:37:54,440
I need to do my revisions.

884
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:59,360
Young Master,
are you sure you won't see anyone?

885
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,159
Shut up.

886
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,960
I need to do my revisions.

887
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:14,119
Pufferfish toxin?

888
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,279
That's right.

889
00:38:15,799 --> 00:38:16,719
Pufferfish toxin

890
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,119
is mostly located in the organs.

891
00:38:18,639 --> 00:38:20,480
And, it has a fishy smell.

892
00:38:21,319 --> 00:38:22,719
If one wishes to mix pufferfish toxin

893
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:23,799
into one's tea

894
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,480
without letting the consumer notice it,

895
00:38:25,639 --> 00:38:26,759
he needs the help

896
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,960
of a pufferfish expert

897
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,240
to extract the toxin from the fish

898
00:38:30,279 --> 00:38:31,319
and mix them into the tea.

899
00:38:32,279 --> 00:38:33,719
Who can perform such deeds?

900
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,119
Pufferfish is hard to handle

901
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,960
even for daily consumption purposes.

902
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,520
If one wishes to extract
pufferfish toxin from the fish,

903
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,319
he needs the help

904
00:38:42,799 --> 00:38:44,119
of a cook who specializes

905
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:45,080
in pufferfish.

906
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,920
Butler Bai.

907
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,880
Seventh Lady, what do you need?

908
00:38:58,639 --> 00:38:59,480
Butler Bai,

909
00:38:59,639 --> 00:39:01,279
I've been craving certain foods lately.

910
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:04,360
I heard that pufferfish is delicious.

911
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,119
Butler Bai, do you know any cook

912
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,639
who can prepare pufferfish?

913
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:10,599
Liuhe Tavern sells such dishes.

914
00:39:10,624 --> 00:39:12,200
Seventh Lady,
I'll send someone to buy them

915
00:39:12,208 --> 00:39:13,110
if you crave it.

916
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,159
I know.

917
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,119
But the pufferfish in Liuhe Tavern

918
00:39:16,199 --> 00:39:17,239
is extremely hard to come by.

919
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,480
Isn't it better if we instruct our cooks

920
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,599
to prepare it themselves?

921
00:39:21,279 --> 00:39:22,279
Not many people

922
00:39:22,279 --> 00:39:24,080
in the capital know
the existence of such a dish.

923
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,880
There are even fewer cooks

924
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:27,269
who know how to prepare pufferfish.

925
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:29,008
I don't think I can
find someone like that

926
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,639
in such a short period.

927
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,159
Has no one in the residence

928
00:39:33,239 --> 00:39:34,840
prepared pufferfish before?

929
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:35,899
I've spent half of my life

930
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,080
serving the residence and family.

931
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,239
I've never seen it.

932
00:39:38,416 --> 00:39:39,440
Usually, ordinary residents

933
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,920
won't make such dishes.

934
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,040
It's fatal

935
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,960
if the cook doesn't
prepare it appropriately.

936
00:39:45,783 --> 00:39:47,584
(Luo's Residence)

937
00:39:56,279 --> 00:39:57,159
Isn't that pufferfish?

938
00:39:58,224 --> 00:40:00,256
Right.
This is braised pufferfish,

939
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:02,240
a specialty dish in the south
of the Yangtze River,

940
00:40:02,279 --> 00:40:03,679
I instructed Butler Bai

941
00:40:03,679 --> 00:40:04,960
to buy this from

942
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,679
Liuhe Tavern.

943
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,279
Please try it.

944
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,440
This dish is made best in the south.

945
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,920
It's rare to find this dish here.

946
00:40:11,024 --> 00:40:12,920
Liuhe Tavern only sells
a few of them per day.

947
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,624
But you managed
to buy quite a lot of them.

948
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,199
Yining,

949
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,159
pufferfish is poisonous, you know?

950
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,480
You dare to eat it?

951
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,279
Pufferfish is poisonous indeed.

952
00:40:21,279 --> 00:40:22,480
However, it's delicious

953
00:40:22,639 --> 00:40:23,599
if it's prepared well.

954
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:25,440
As Mr. Su Dongpo once said,

955
00:40:25,504 --> 00:40:27,670
"Its delicious taste will make one
die for it willingly."

956
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,599
Just look at him.

957
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:32,319
He needs to speak in riddles
even when we're eating.

958
00:40:37,159 --> 00:40:38,920
Second Master,
you should try it too.

959
00:40:39,719 --> 00:40:41,119
I don't take pufferfish.

960
00:40:41,799 --> 00:40:43,199
We have less than half a month

961
00:40:43,216 --> 00:40:45,190
until the imperial examination
after today's banquet.

962
00:40:45,279 --> 00:40:48,080
Shenyuan, Xuanyuan, Shanyuan,

963
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:51,080
you three have to
pull yourselves together.

964
00:41:05,799 --> 00:41:06,599
Yining,

965
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:08,080
I loved this dish since young.

966
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,119
But it's a rare dish in the capital.

967
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,520
This braised pufferfish
is delicious indeed.

968
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,279
No wonder I craved it every day.

969
00:41:20,799 --> 00:41:21,599
Yining.

970
00:41:22,759 --> 00:41:23,520
Third Brother?

971
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,789
Why did you suddenly feel like

972
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:29,792
having pufferfish today?

973
00:41:29,824 --> 00:41:31,480
Was it because of Madam Gu?

974
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,279
I was merely

975
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:35,799
craving pufferfish.

976
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,679
Third Brother, don't overthink it.

977
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:40,639
You should rest well
and do your revisions today.

978
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,199
Young Master, we should go.

979
00:41:51,376 --> 00:41:51,960
All right.

980
00:42:04,799 --> 00:42:07,279
Madam Chen, Her Highness
has sent her men here.

981
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:10,799
Why did Her Highness do so?

982
00:42:11,639 --> 00:42:13,759
She said she had a gift for Sixth Lady.

983
00:42:30,679 --> 00:42:32,440
Mother, are all of these snacks

984
00:42:33,679 --> 00:42:34,480
for me?

985
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:37,360
That's right. Eat up.

986
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:39,520
But I thought you forbade me

987
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,080
from eating snacks.

988
00:42:41,159 --> 00:42:42,960
I've finally figured it out.

989
00:42:43,319 --> 00:42:44,239
In the past,

990
00:42:44,239 --> 00:42:46,279
I always forced you
to do the things you disliked.

991
00:42:46,279 --> 00:42:47,440
I didn't feel good either

992
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,440
when you were upset.

993
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:51,520
Now, I'm letting you have your way.

994
00:42:51,552 --> 00:42:52,880
You can have all the food you like.

995
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,639
No need to lose weight
if you don't want to.

996
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:56,679
You don't need to get married
if you don't wish to.

997
00:42:56,799 --> 00:42:58,040
As for your father and brothers,

998
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,904
they can deal with
their own affairs themselves.

999
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:01,310
It's fine as long as you're happy.

1000
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:03,639
Mother.

1001
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:06,759
My dear girl, eat up.

1002
00:43:09,639 --> 00:43:10,960
I'll try this first.

1003
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:25,199
