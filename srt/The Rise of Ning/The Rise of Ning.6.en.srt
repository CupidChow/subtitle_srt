(Adapted from Wen Tan's novel "Chancellor
Training Handbook" from Jinjiang Literature)

00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,814
=Episode 6=

4
00:01:42,147 --> 00:01:43,108
Good goose.

5
00:01:45,347 --> 00:01:47,267
Sixth Uncle, there you are.

6
00:01:47,427 --> 00:01:48,427
Yining.

7
00:01:48,828 --> 00:01:50,059
What are you doing?

8
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,620
You came at the right time. Sit with me.

9
00:01:51,748 --> 00:01:52,588
Talk to me.

10
00:01:52,748 --> 00:01:54,067
I'm bored.

11
00:01:54,188 --> 00:01:56,468
Is this vast capital still
not enough to entertain you?

12
00:01:56,547 --> 00:01:57,787
How could you be bored?

13
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,850
My sister has confiscated

14
00:01:59,028 --> 00:02:00,228
all the taels and notes

15
00:02:00,308 --> 00:02:01,427
I had hidden.

16
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:03,308
I'm penniless now.

17
00:02:03,328 --> 00:02:05,120
I don't even have money
to go out for a drink

18
00:02:05,147 --> 00:02:05,820
to lift my spirits.

19
00:02:05,828 --> 00:02:07,308
It's vexing.

20
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:09,067
Poor you.

21
00:02:09,347 --> 00:02:11,308
But I can't help you.

22
00:02:11,468 --> 00:02:13,428
I have neither liquor nor money.

23
00:02:13,827 --> 00:02:14,387
Maybe you can

24
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:15,907
talk to your mother?

25
00:02:16,067 --> 00:02:16,827
Think about it.

26
00:02:16,947 --> 00:02:17,827
Whether one can pass

27
00:02:17,907 --> 00:02:18,947
the imperial exams

28
00:02:19,067 --> 00:02:20,227
is something predestined.

29
00:02:20,272 --> 00:02:21,740
I was born without any talent for that.

30
00:02:21,907 --> 00:02:23,387
She's wasting her efforts.

31
00:02:23,468 --> 00:02:24,907
She shouldn't force me.

32
00:02:26,227 --> 00:02:26,988
Sixth Uncle,

33
00:02:27,067 --> 00:02:28,988
do you know my third brother?

34
00:02:29,067 --> 00:02:30,067
I do.

35
00:02:30,227 --> 00:02:31,907
I hear he's not very well-liked.

36
00:02:32,347 --> 00:02:33,708
I'll tell you a secret.

37
00:02:33,827 --> 00:02:34,947
He often sneaks out

38
00:02:35,067 --> 00:02:36,868
from Luo's Residence.

39
00:02:36,988 --> 00:02:38,468
If you follow him,

40
00:02:38,548 --> 00:02:39,468
you'll surely find

41
00:02:39,588 --> 00:02:40,468
many fun places to go.

42
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:41,947
And if you follow him,

43
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:43,428
he won't ask for your money,

44
00:02:43,548 --> 00:02:43,947
right?

45
00:02:44,067 --> 00:02:44,588
Really?

46
00:02:46,067 --> 00:02:47,787
Keep this a secret, though.

47
00:02:47,907 --> 00:02:48,907
Don't tell anyone else.

48
00:02:48,947 --> 00:02:50,428
I love secrets.

49
00:03:02,748 --> 00:03:03,827
He is going out, after all.

50
00:03:04,244 --> 00:03:06,870
(Liuhe Tavern)

51
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,140
Well, if it isn't my
third nephew, Shenyuan!

52
00:03:13,188 --> 00:03:14,067
Fancy seeing you here.

53
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:15,468
Who are you?

54
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:17,148
I'm your sixth uncle.

55
00:03:17,308 --> 00:03:18,708
Madam Lin's brother.

56
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:20,227
Have you never seen me in the residence?

57
00:03:22,067 --> 00:03:23,148
Greetings, Sixth Uncle.

58
00:03:23,227 --> 00:03:24,468
That's more like it.

59
00:03:24,588 --> 00:03:25,667
I've heard a lot about you

60
00:03:25,787 --> 00:03:26,548
from Yining.

61
00:03:27,107 --> 00:03:28,268
Are you dining alone

62
00:03:28,588 --> 00:03:29,627
or waiting for company?

63
00:03:30,827 --> 00:03:32,028
I snuck out

64
00:03:32,268 --> 00:03:33,708
alone.

65
00:03:33,744 --> 00:03:35,584
A chance meeting
is better than a planned one.

66
00:03:35,588 --> 00:03:36,507
This meal will be

67
00:03:36,588 --> 00:03:37,787
on you, then.

68
00:03:37,868 --> 00:03:39,148
As showing filial piety to me.

69
00:03:39,347 --> 00:03:40,588
Server, take our order.

70
00:03:41,428 --> 00:03:41,988
Coming.

71
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:47,947
Shenyuan,

72
00:03:48,067 --> 00:03:49,227
anything else you'd like to add?

73
00:03:49,627 --> 00:03:51,148
A meal is incomplete without liquor.

74
00:03:52,028 --> 00:03:52,627
That's right.

75
00:03:52,748 --> 00:03:53,907
I do like you.

76
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,936
Bring us two jars
of your finest pear blossom liquor.

77
00:04:00,347 --> 00:04:00,988
As expected

78
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,368
of the capital's best tavern.

79
00:04:02,368 --> 00:04:03,530
It lives up to its reputation.

80
00:04:03,548 --> 00:04:04,708
Let's have a toast, Shenyuan.

81
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:05,067
Mister.

82
00:04:05,067 --> 00:04:05,907
Let us drink!

83
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:08,308
Mister.

84
00:04:08,428 --> 00:04:09,387
That's my liquor.

85
00:04:09,507 --> 00:04:11,028
I know it's yours.

86
00:04:14,067 --> 00:04:15,507
Here. Have another.

87
00:04:24,788 --> 00:04:25,308
Young Master.

88
00:04:27,548 --> 00:04:28,988
Li Yinglong left the inn today

89
00:04:28,992 --> 00:04:30,160
and went to Yuanjing Pavilion.

90
00:04:30,908 --> 00:04:32,108
Yuanjing Pavilion?

91
00:04:34,147 --> 00:04:35,788
Is there a theatre performance tomorrow?

92
00:04:36,147 --> 00:04:36,788
Yes.

93
00:04:37,467 --> 00:04:38,587
Could Li Yinglong be planning

94
00:04:38,707 --> 00:04:39,868
to meet the person

95
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:40,947
behind the scenes there?

96
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:42,188
But with a performance,

97
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,712
there'll be a crowd
and many prying eyes.

98
00:04:43,788 --> 00:04:45,147
The more people, the better.

99
00:04:45,387 --> 00:04:46,707
Even if discovered,

100
00:04:46,827 --> 00:04:48,188
it'll be easier to conceal actions.

101
00:04:48,507 --> 00:04:49,587
Inform Shopkeeper Zheng

102
00:04:49,616 --> 00:04:50,820
that we'll go tomorrow as well.

103
00:04:50,947 --> 00:04:51,668
Understood.

104
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:54,016
There's been progress on the matter

105
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,990
regarding Physician Du

106
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,160
which you asked me to look into.

107
00:04:56,188 --> 00:04:57,707
He inquired at Longquan Trading House

108
00:04:57,827 --> 00:05:00,627
for a rare batch of ambergris.

109
00:05:00,827 --> 00:05:02,348
But due to its rarity,

110
00:05:02,467 --> 00:05:04,108
the shop seldom has it in stock.

111
00:05:04,507 --> 00:05:06,147
Why does he want ambergris?

112
00:05:06,748 --> 00:05:08,788
I heard he once treated
the Imperial Noble Consort

113
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:09,868
for a heart ailment,

114
00:05:09,988 --> 00:05:11,067
and ambergris was one

115
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,656
of the ingredients in the prescription.

116
00:05:15,376 --> 00:05:16,580
Send someone to find some.

117
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,467
It could come in handy.

118
00:05:18,507 --> 00:05:18,947
Yes.

119
00:05:19,067 --> 00:05:20,988
Live for the moment
and drink while we can.

120
00:05:21,027 --> 00:05:22,507
Come, drink more.

121
00:05:23,188 --> 00:05:23,868
Carry on.

122
00:05:24,108 --> 00:05:24,748
Young Master.

123
00:05:24,988 --> 00:05:27,467
What about the guest downstairs?

124
00:05:27,548 --> 00:05:28,868
Well, he is a guest.

125
00:05:29,348 --> 00:05:31,267
Escort him back to Luo's Residence.

126
00:05:35,308 --> 00:05:38,947
It's truly lush and green here.

127
00:05:40,228 --> 00:05:42,067
Look at these plants,

128
00:05:42,188 --> 00:05:44,467
so vibrant and flourishing.

129
00:05:44,868 --> 00:05:46,988
Your grandpa planted them himself

130
00:05:47,108 --> 00:05:48,947
in this imperial gift

131
00:05:49,027 --> 00:05:50,707
of a residence.

132
00:05:52,067 --> 00:05:55,748
Time passes by freely,
whether in the west or east.

133
00:05:56,308 --> 00:05:58,988
No matter how the frost
and wind touched his hair,

134
00:05:59,467 --> 00:06:01,627
he hoped these plants

135
00:06:01,947 --> 00:06:04,067
would stand tall

136
00:06:04,267 --> 00:06:06,668
through any storm.

137
00:06:08,707 --> 00:06:09,908
Alas,

138
00:06:11,868 --> 00:06:13,947
when it came to my two sons…

139
00:06:14,308 --> 00:06:15,507
I've let down

140
00:06:16,308 --> 00:06:18,147
Luo's Residence

141
00:06:19,827 --> 00:06:21,748
and your grandpa.

142
00:06:22,108 --> 00:06:23,348
Grandma,

143
00:06:23,627 --> 00:06:25,267
you mustn't say that.

144
00:06:25,868 --> 00:06:27,188
This glory and honor

145
00:06:27,308 --> 00:06:29,108
come with their own perils.

146
00:06:29,267 --> 00:06:30,027
Think about it.

147
00:06:30,267 --> 00:06:32,428
My father and uncle both serve

148
00:06:32,548 --> 00:06:34,387
in the court.

149
00:06:34,507 --> 00:06:35,827
For us to live here,

150
00:06:35,908 --> 00:06:38,587
free from want, and in peace

151
00:06:38,827 --> 00:06:40,467
is already a blessing.

152
00:06:42,467 --> 00:06:43,947
Silly child.

153
00:06:46,507 --> 00:06:48,348
It's lonely at the top,

154
00:06:48,507 --> 00:06:50,668
and in the low places, one is mere prey.

155
00:06:50,908 --> 00:06:52,308
Perhaps you've resented me

156
00:06:52,428 --> 00:06:53,868
for being so tolerant

157
00:06:53,988 --> 00:06:55,868
of Mistress Qiao all these years.

158
00:06:55,888 --> 00:06:59,027
But she is Xuan's birth mother,
after all.

159
00:06:59,147 --> 00:07:00,587
Xuan could be

160
00:07:00,868 --> 00:07:02,868
the only hope to restore

161
00:07:02,947 --> 00:07:04,507
the Luo family's glory.

162
00:07:04,668 --> 00:07:06,467
But with her temperament,

163
00:07:06,548 --> 00:07:08,668
if Xuan rises to prominence

164
00:07:08,748 --> 00:07:09,627
and enters officialdom,

165
00:07:09,748 --> 00:07:11,668
will he really take the revival
of Luo's Residence

166
00:07:11,788 --> 00:07:12,947
as his duty?

167
00:07:14,827 --> 00:07:16,348
Regardless of the circumstances,

168
00:07:16,668 --> 00:07:18,827
he is still a descendant
of Luo's Residence.

169
00:07:19,027 --> 00:07:20,668
But he's not the only descendant

170
00:07:20,788 --> 00:07:22,188
of Luo's Residence.

171
00:07:24,627 --> 00:07:25,868
Shan.

172
00:07:26,188 --> 00:07:28,908
Shan is not cut out for studying.

173
00:07:28,988 --> 00:07:29,868
No matter how harshly

174
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:31,147
your aunt disciplines him,

175
00:07:31,188 --> 00:07:32,147
there's been

176
00:07:32,188 --> 00:07:33,748
no improvement.

177
00:07:37,027 --> 00:07:38,188
Are you perhaps

178
00:07:38,308 --> 00:07:41,668
referring to the one from Jimo House?

179
00:07:44,188 --> 00:07:46,108
I've noticed you've been seeing

180
00:07:46,387 --> 00:07:48,147
more of him lately.

181
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:49,188
You even quarreled

182
00:07:49,308 --> 00:07:51,387
with your father over him.

183
00:07:51,868 --> 00:07:53,827
Well, he is also a descendant
of Luo's Residence

184
00:07:53,947 --> 00:07:55,467
and my elder brother.

185
00:07:55,827 --> 00:07:58,788
You are clever,

186
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:01,027
but too soft-hearted.

187
00:08:01,387 --> 00:08:03,507
I've lived long enough

188
00:08:03,548 --> 00:08:04,788
to have seen all kinds of people.

189
00:08:05,027 --> 00:08:06,267
Anyone who can endure

190
00:08:06,548 --> 00:08:07,947
what ordinary people cannot

191
00:08:08,067 --> 00:08:09,548
is not someone

192
00:08:10,348 --> 00:08:12,707
to be taken lightly.

193
00:08:18,067 --> 00:08:18,988
Mister.

194
00:08:19,467 --> 00:08:20,267
I'm fine.

195
00:08:20,868 --> 00:08:21,339
Mister.

196
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,288
I don't need your help.

197
00:08:25,587 --> 00:08:27,027
- I'm not drunk.
- Easy there.

198
00:08:27,147 --> 00:08:29,027
I can still drink… I can…

199
00:08:32,867 --> 00:08:34,107
Buddy!

200
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:36,347
Come. Drink with me!

201
00:08:37,028 --> 00:08:38,028
Let's drink more!

202
00:08:38,668 --> 00:08:39,268
Mister.

203
00:08:39,587 --> 00:08:40,188
Drink with me.

204
00:08:40,308 --> 00:08:40,747
Butler Bai,

205
00:08:40,908 --> 00:08:41,668
get him inside.

206
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:43,148
Don't let him make a scene here.

207
00:08:43,308 --> 00:08:43,908
He won't drink.

208
00:08:44,028 --> 00:08:45,308
Mister, please go back.

209
00:08:45,388 --> 00:08:45,908
We…

210
00:08:45,987 --> 00:08:47,628
We can carry on drinking!

211
00:08:47,747 --> 00:08:48,947
Madam,

212
00:08:49,188 --> 00:08:50,908
he hasn't paid yet…

213
00:08:51,747 --> 00:08:54,188
When things are going well,
one must enjoy them to the fullest.

214
00:08:54,308 --> 00:08:56,628
Live for the moment
and drink while we can.

215
00:08:56,908 --> 00:08:59,067
Drink with me. Are you drinking or not?

216
00:08:59,152 --> 00:09:00,100
Are you drinking or not?

217
00:09:00,628 --> 00:09:01,428
You won't drink?

218
00:09:01,668 --> 00:09:02,827
I'm not going back.

219
00:09:12,788 --> 00:09:14,268
Don't you recognize where this is?

220
00:09:15,587 --> 00:09:16,347
How did I

221
00:09:17,628 --> 00:09:19,867
end up back at the residence in a flash?

222
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:21,148
Sober now?

223
00:09:21,587 --> 00:09:22,867
Yes.

224
00:09:24,148 --> 00:09:26,067
Hairu, I was wrong!

225
00:09:26,192 --> 00:09:26,980
I know my mistake.

226
00:09:28,188 --> 00:09:29,747
You've grown bold, haven't you?

227
00:09:30,867 --> 00:09:32,779
No money, and you still dare
to go out drinking,

228
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,980
and then get sent back by others.

229
00:09:33,987 --> 00:09:35,107
Aren't you ashamed?

230
00:09:36,107 --> 00:09:37,707
Maybe you should send me back to Lin'an.

231
00:09:37,728 --> 00:09:38,260
Not a chance.

232
00:09:38,867 --> 00:09:40,188
Father put me in charge

233
00:09:40,347 --> 00:09:41,188
of you.

234
00:09:41,344 --> 00:09:42,496
If you don't behave,

235
00:09:42,512 --> 00:09:44,360
don't return to Lin'an
for the rest of your life.

236
00:09:44,388 --> 00:09:46,067
To make sure you learn a lesson,

237
00:09:47,067 --> 00:09:48,308
give him 20 strikes.

238
00:09:48,668 --> 00:09:49,347
Yes.

239
00:09:50,148 --> 00:09:50,668
Hairu!

240
00:09:51,107 --> 00:09:52,707
No! On the hands! The hands!

241
00:09:56,188 --> 00:09:57,987
Sixth Uncle, does it still hurt?

242
00:09:58,428 --> 00:09:59,587
How could it not hurt?

243
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:01,947
You have no idea
how harsh your mother is.

244
00:10:06,268 --> 00:10:07,788
What happened?

245
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,740
How did you end up
being sent back by performers?

246
00:10:09,908 --> 00:10:11,188
You've got some nerve asking.

247
00:10:11,312 --> 00:10:12,340
Your third brother went off

248
00:10:12,508 --> 00:10:14,028
to Liuhe Tavern to have a grand time.

249
00:10:14,148 --> 00:10:15,867
I just wanted to tag along
for a good meal.

250
00:10:16,067 --> 00:10:16,908
Somehow,

251
00:10:17,028 --> 00:10:18,227
I ended up drinking a lot

252
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,280
with those two performers,

253
00:10:19,308 --> 00:10:20,347
and he didn't pay the bill.

254
00:10:20,827 --> 00:10:22,347
So, I had to be sent back.

255
00:10:23,827 --> 00:10:25,867
He usually lives simply.

256
00:10:26,628 --> 00:10:28,227
Perhaps he went to Liuhe Tavern

257
00:10:29,227 --> 00:10:30,867
to meet someone?

258
00:10:31,268 --> 00:10:32,587
Probably not.

259
00:10:32,867 --> 00:10:34,467
You were brought back.

260
00:10:34,668 --> 00:10:35,987
What about my third brother?

261
00:10:36,188 --> 00:10:37,707
How would I know?

262
00:10:37,827 --> 00:10:38,467
I just know

263
00:10:38,587 --> 00:10:39,867
he's not very loyal.

264
00:10:42,347 --> 00:10:43,148
Never mind.

265
00:10:43,168 --> 00:10:44,260
I won't hold it against him.

266
00:10:44,908 --> 00:10:46,428
You rest well, then.

267
00:10:46,548 --> 00:10:48,268
I'll have Xue Zhi

268
00:10:48,428 --> 00:10:49,388
bring you some tonics.

269
00:10:49,467 --> 00:10:51,268
Forget about those.

270
00:10:51,548 --> 00:10:53,347
Just send me two jars
of pear blossom liquor.

271
00:10:53,587 --> 00:10:54,908
I have to say,

272
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,028
the liquor at Liuhe Tavern

273
00:10:56,148 --> 00:10:56,827
wasn't bad at all.

274
00:10:57,467 --> 00:10:58,268
If you ask me,

275
00:10:58,388 --> 00:11:00,308
my mother went too easy on you.

276
00:11:16,908 --> 00:11:17,747
Xue Zhi.

277
00:11:19,347 --> 00:11:20,747
You're finally back.

278
00:11:21,028 --> 00:11:22,987
So? Where did Third Brother go?

279
00:11:23,067 --> 00:11:23,867
Yuanjing Pavilion.

280
00:11:24,467 --> 00:11:25,788
Yuanjing Pavilion?

281
00:11:26,308 --> 00:11:28,067
Is there some event there?

282
00:11:28,148 --> 00:11:29,308
There's a theatre performance.

283
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:31,107
Many prominent families
will be attending.

284
00:11:31,668 --> 00:11:33,788
I've never heard

285
00:11:33,908 --> 00:11:35,388
that he likes theatre.

286
00:11:35,827 --> 00:11:37,067
Help!

287
00:11:37,148 --> 00:11:37,908
Help!

288
00:11:37,987 --> 00:11:38,707
Sixth Sister!

289
00:11:38,908 --> 00:11:40,707
Save me!

290
00:11:43,067 --> 00:11:43,827
No!

291
00:11:45,827 --> 00:11:46,707
Don't come near me!

292
00:11:50,188 --> 00:11:51,268
Help!

293
00:11:51,347 --> 00:11:53,428
Yining, save me!

294
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:54,548
Don't come any closer!

295
00:11:54,628 --> 00:11:55,227
Stay away!

296
00:11:55,467 --> 00:11:56,467
Sixth Uncle!

297
00:11:56,668 --> 00:11:57,707
Sixth Uncle!

298
00:11:58,028 --> 00:11:59,747
Catch that goose!

299
00:12:00,388 --> 00:12:02,028
She brought this on herself.

300
00:12:02,467 --> 00:12:03,747
Are you going to catch it or not?

301
00:12:03,867 --> 00:12:04,867
Stop…

302
00:12:05,067 --> 00:12:06,628
You've really been spoiled by my sister.

303
00:12:06,788 --> 00:12:07,788
Hurry up!

304
00:12:08,908 --> 00:12:09,867
Lin Fugui!

305
00:12:13,668 --> 00:12:15,508
Lin Fugui! Fugui! Come here!

306
00:12:15,628 --> 00:12:16,308
Come here.

307
00:12:23,188 --> 00:12:24,308
Come here, Fugui.

308
00:12:27,548 --> 00:12:28,388
Don't be afraid.

309
00:12:28,508 --> 00:12:30,188
Let me help you.

310
00:12:38,548 --> 00:12:39,227
Sixth Uncle.

311
00:12:39,347 --> 00:12:41,148
Why are you bullying my sixth sister?

312
00:12:41,408 --> 00:12:42,740
How can you say I'm bullying her?

313
00:12:42,867 --> 00:12:44,308
Last time, when she saw Fugui,

314
00:12:44,428 --> 00:12:45,788
she kept saying she'd eat him.

315
00:12:45,908 --> 00:12:47,148
Of course Fugui got angry.

316
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:48,863
Don't blame the goose.

317
00:12:48,864 --> 00:12:49,979
It doesn't understand us.

318
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:51,389
You must have taught it to bully me.

319
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:52,947
So impertinent.

320
00:12:53,707 --> 00:12:54,788
Do you know who I am?

321
00:12:54,867 --> 00:12:56,188
Aren't you a relative

322
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:56,780
of Second Aunt?

323
00:12:56,867 --> 00:12:58,548
But that doesn't mean you can bully me.

324
00:12:58,867 --> 00:13:00,347
I'm your sixth uncle.

325
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,260
You're a lady
of the esteemed Luo's Residence.

326
00:13:02,260 --> 00:13:04,340
How can you behave
without any respect for your elders?

327
00:13:04,347 --> 00:13:05,587
Sixth Uncle?

328
00:13:05,707 --> 00:13:07,428
He says he's our sixth uncle.

329
00:13:07,867 --> 00:13:09,347
He is our sixth uncle.

330
00:13:10,987 --> 00:13:12,707
I thought he was a nephew.

331
00:13:13,067 --> 00:13:14,139
Sixth Niece.

332
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,180
Didn't your family teach you

333
00:13:15,268 --> 00:13:16,707
to greet your elders with respect?

334
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:19,947
Such impudence.

335
00:13:25,908 --> 00:13:26,508
By the way,

336
00:13:26,628 --> 00:13:28,508
what did you come here for today?

337
00:13:28,587 --> 00:13:30,107
Oh, right. Go get ready.

338
00:13:30,188 --> 00:13:31,308
We're going out in a while.

339
00:13:31,628 --> 00:13:32,347
Where to?

340
00:13:32,448 --> 00:13:33,580
Yuanjing Pavilion, of course.

341
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,912
Ms. Shen from the Count's Residence

342
00:13:34,928 --> 00:13:36,290
invited us to watch
the performance.

343
00:13:36,508 --> 00:13:37,388
She said theatre troupe

344
00:13:37,392 --> 00:13:39,090
is one that ordinary people
could never hire.

345
00:13:39,107 --> 00:13:40,028
You have to come with me.

346
00:13:40,107 --> 00:13:41,508
If it's just Yiyu and Yilian,

347
00:13:41,628 --> 00:13:43,148
it won't be as fun.

348
00:13:44,028 --> 00:13:45,668
All right. I'll come too.

349
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:48,347
The weather is lovely today.

350
00:13:48,867 --> 00:13:49,668
Are we not taking

351
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:51,107
our own carriage today?

352
00:13:51,548 --> 00:13:53,628
Yuanjing Pavilion
is heavily guarded today.

353
00:13:53,747 --> 00:13:54,947
Only carriages from households

354
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,544
with formal invitations
are allowed inside.

355
00:13:56,548 --> 00:13:57,268
Do you want

356
00:13:57,347 --> 00:13:59,268
to walk in yourself once you reach

357
00:13:59,347 --> 00:14:00,668
the entrance of Yuanjing Pavilion?

358
00:14:03,867 --> 00:14:04,668
Lian.

359
00:14:05,548 --> 00:14:06,067
Come here.

360
00:14:07,467 --> 00:14:08,227
Mistress Qiao.

361
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,848
Your health is delicate,

362
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,370
and the wind by the river is strong.
Be careful not to catch a cold.

363
00:14:13,388 --> 00:14:16,067
Here, put this on.

364
00:14:21,428 --> 00:14:22,347
Seventh Lady,

365
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:24,268
your pale yellow cloth jacket

366
00:14:24,388 --> 00:14:25,827
looks beautiful.

367
00:14:27,148 --> 00:14:28,747
It complements the scenery

368
00:14:28,752 --> 00:14:30,060
of Yuanjing Pavilion beautifully.

369
00:14:31,428 --> 00:14:32,908
Thank you for your kind words.

370
00:14:33,308 --> 00:14:35,227
The carriage is here. Don't dawdle.

371
00:14:35,347 --> 00:14:36,268
Hurry on.

372
00:14:37,548 --> 00:14:38,308
Be careful.

373
00:14:38,428 --> 00:14:40,107
Remember to wear your cloak, understood?

374
00:14:40,268 --> 00:14:42,428
Make sure you're dressed warmly.
Be careful on the way.

375
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,320
(Luo's Residence)

376
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,440
(Yuanjing Pavilion)

377
00:15:11,867 --> 00:15:12,867
What are you looking for?

378
00:15:14,188 --> 00:15:16,028
I'm waiting to see the performance.

379
00:15:16,107 --> 00:15:17,388
You should watch from over there.

380
00:15:17,508 --> 00:15:18,268
Come, I'll take you.

381
00:15:18,347 --> 00:15:19,707
There's plenty of good food as well.

382
00:15:19,908 --> 00:15:20,908
Let's go.

383
00:16:15,148 --> 00:16:16,188
Miss,

384
00:16:17,188 --> 00:16:18,107
your handkerchief.

385
00:16:34,508 --> 00:16:36,347
I wonder which family
that young man belongs to.

386
00:16:36,508 --> 00:16:37,268
Shall I help you

387
00:16:37,388 --> 00:16:39,148
find out?

388
00:16:40,227 --> 00:16:41,587
What's there to find out?

389
00:16:42,188 --> 00:16:44,308
All he did was return my handkerchief.

390
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,020
(Yuanjing Pavilion)

391
00:17:10,227 --> 00:17:13,068
Is there a ghost named Liu Qingti

392
00:17:13,108 --> 00:17:15,828
in Fengdu City?

393
00:17:16,108 --> 00:17:20,307
If so, speak up.

394
00:17:24,987 --> 00:17:32,507
Yes.

395
00:17:38,908 --> 00:17:39,388
Yining,

396
00:17:39,456 --> 00:17:40,580
I've heard that this troupe

397
00:17:40,707 --> 00:17:42,908
performed for His Majesty
and was praised by him.

398
00:17:42,944 --> 00:17:43,980
They're very hard to book.

399
00:17:44,027 --> 00:17:45,108
Looks like Shen Jiarou

400
00:17:45,227 --> 00:17:46,188
really went all out.

401
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:57,068
Look.

402
00:17:57,188 --> 00:17:57,868
Look.

403
00:17:58,108 --> 00:17:59,148
Yilian is crying again

404
00:17:59,267 --> 00:17:59,947
over there.

405
00:18:00,068 --> 00:18:00,947
Who knows what story

406
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:01,900
she's spinning this time?

407
00:18:02,828 --> 00:18:04,547
She loves to act weak and pitiful.

408
00:18:04,668 --> 00:18:05,987
Let her say whatever she wants.

409
00:18:08,547 --> 00:18:09,588
What are you looking for?

410
00:18:10,348 --> 00:18:12,267
I want to see
where Third Brother is sitting.

411
00:18:13,472 --> 00:18:15,460
The Shen family always
has their noses in the air.

412
00:18:15,547 --> 00:18:16,739
It's unlikely they invited him.

413
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,380
I thought you were looking
for Cheng Lang.

414
00:18:18,467 --> 00:18:19,227
Cheng Lang?

415
00:18:19,388 --> 00:18:20,307
Who's that?

416
00:18:20,987 --> 00:18:21,987
The one in blue.

417
00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:23,868
One of the most handsome men
in the capital.

418
00:18:23,888 --> 00:18:25,248
His character, looks, and talents

419
00:18:25,248 --> 00:18:26,380
are among the best of the best.

420
00:18:26,507 --> 00:18:28,307
Many young girls fancy him.

421
00:18:28,787 --> 00:18:31,108
He seems to have a lot on his mind.

422
00:18:31,488 --> 00:18:33,260
He's from a humble background
and was bullied

423
00:18:33,296 --> 00:18:35,020
by his legitimate brother
when he was young.

424
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:36,787
It's rather sad.

425
00:18:37,267 --> 00:18:38,227
Sixth Sister,

426
00:18:38,388 --> 00:18:39,628
how do you know all this?

427
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:40,388
Of course,

428
00:18:40,467 --> 00:18:41,348
I know everything.

429
00:18:41,467 --> 00:18:41,868
Listen.

430
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,020
He's lucky to have a good uncle,

431
00:18:43,027 --> 00:18:43,747
Lu Jiaxue.

432
00:18:43,868 --> 00:18:44,868
When Lu Jiaxue

433
00:18:44,947 --> 00:18:46,348
was made Marquis,

434
00:18:46,428 --> 00:18:47,227
he legitimized

435
00:18:47,307 --> 00:18:48,148
his sister's status,

436
00:18:48,267 --> 00:18:51,267
which is how Cheng Lang's
status was elevated.

437
00:19:04,068 --> 00:19:06,068
His Majesty holds Lu Jiaxue
in high regard.

438
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,344
He's still unmarried,

439
00:19:07,344 --> 00:19:09,060
and every noble family
in the city is hoping

440
00:19:09,070 --> 00:19:10,307
to marry
their daughters to him.

441
00:19:10,428 --> 00:19:12,108
I wonder who'll have that fortune.

442
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:14,304
Are you speaking of Lu Jiaxue

443
00:19:14,348 --> 00:19:16,307
from the Marquis Anbei's Residence?

444
00:19:16,428 --> 00:19:17,987
Yes. Do you know him?

445
00:19:24,947 --> 00:19:25,868
Sixth Sister,

446
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,264
it's too crowded here.

447
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,020
I'd like to step outside
for some fresh air.

448
00:19:29,056 --> 00:19:30,140
I'll come with you.

449
00:19:30,267 --> 00:19:30,828
No need.

450
00:19:30,908 --> 00:19:32,307
You stay and enjoy the performance.

451
00:19:35,628 --> 00:19:45,547
Liu Qingti.

452
00:20:24,188 --> 00:20:26,148
Seventh Lady came, after all.

453
00:20:26,588 --> 00:20:27,307
I knew

454
00:20:27,388 --> 00:20:29,188
you were fond of liveliness.

455
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,140
Or how could it be

456
00:20:30,192 --> 00:20:31,392
that the moment you return,

457
00:20:31,428 --> 00:20:33,507
the entire household
is thrown into chaos?

458
00:20:34,588 --> 00:20:36,628
The Luo's Residence
is one-of-a-kind indeed.

459
00:20:36,987 --> 00:20:37,947
The legitimate daughter

460
00:20:38,068 --> 00:20:39,868
was sent away to live
at a side yard.

461
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:42,188
Who knows what shameful mistake
she must have made?

462
00:20:42,388 --> 00:20:43,267
We'd best not provoke

463
00:20:43,388 --> 00:20:44,588
her.

464
00:20:45,388 --> 00:20:46,987
Ms. Zhang. Ms. Shen.

465
00:20:47,507 --> 00:20:48,707
Please say no more.

466
00:20:49,068 --> 00:20:49,947
Yilian,

467
00:20:50,188 --> 00:20:51,299
I've told you.

468
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:53,160
If you're too kind,
you'll be taken advantage of.

469
00:20:53,188 --> 00:20:54,908
Some people are so bold and unruly.

470
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,900
They probably don't care

471
00:20:56,027 --> 00:20:57,307
if they're spoken ill of.

472
00:20:57,787 --> 00:20:58,908
You've been bullied

473
00:20:58,987 --> 00:20:59,908
far too much.

474
00:21:00,027 --> 00:21:00,588
She relies

475
00:21:00,707 --> 00:21:01,868
on your grandma's favor

476
00:21:01,872 --> 00:21:03,600
and acts as though
she can do as she pleases.

477
00:21:06,227 --> 00:21:07,227
Ladies,

478
00:21:07,707 --> 00:21:09,707
it's true that I wasn't raised
in Luo's Residence.

479
00:21:10,108 --> 00:21:11,428
If I've neglected any courtesies,

480
00:21:11,507 --> 00:21:12,628
I do hope you'll forgive me.

481
00:21:13,428 --> 00:21:14,628
Now that I'm back,

482
00:21:14,747 --> 00:21:16,588
my grandma has been

483
00:21:16,668 --> 00:21:18,148
teaching me the proper

484
00:21:18,227 --> 00:21:19,348
etiquette of the capital.

485
00:21:19,467 --> 00:21:20,707
The first rule

486
00:21:20,828 --> 00:21:21,868
is not to gossip

487
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,507
or spread rumors

488
00:21:23,787 --> 00:21:25,108
about other households.

489
00:21:25,348 --> 00:21:27,267
You two ladies are here

490
00:21:27,388 --> 00:21:28,707
loudly discussing the affairs

491
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:29,868
of another household.

492
00:21:30,027 --> 00:21:30,987
I wonder

493
00:21:31,108 --> 00:21:32,908
if your household rules

494
00:21:33,027 --> 00:21:34,348
are different from the rest.

495
00:21:34,388 --> 00:21:35,148
How dare you!

496
00:21:35,668 --> 00:21:37,707
Seventh Lady is sharp-tongued indeed.

497
00:21:37,787 --> 00:21:38,828
Is it true that you pushed

498
00:21:38,832 --> 00:21:40,130
Mistress Qiao when you were a child

499
00:21:40,144 --> 00:21:41,220
and caused her to miscarry?

500
00:21:41,348 --> 00:21:43,027
Therefore, you were sent

501
00:21:43,108 --> 00:21:44,947
to the outer estate?

502
00:21:45,707 --> 00:21:46,428
Well?

503
00:21:46,908 --> 00:21:48,747
Your dark past's been exposed,

504
00:21:48,828 --> 00:21:49,787
so you're speechless?

505
00:21:49,868 --> 00:21:50,787
What are you all doing?

506
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:51,960
Don't judge Yining like that.

507
00:21:51,987 --> 00:21:53,267
She was only a child back then.

508
00:21:53,348 --> 00:21:54,027
To commit

509
00:21:54,108 --> 00:21:55,707
such a malicious act
at such a young age.

510
00:21:56,032 --> 00:21:57,820
They say the character
is formed by age three.

511
00:21:57,947 --> 00:21:59,348
Her nature

512
00:21:59,428 --> 00:22:01,668
is quite evident then.

513
00:22:04,388 --> 00:22:05,947
I can't recall too much

514
00:22:06,027 --> 00:22:07,868
about what happened when I was young.

515
00:22:07,904 --> 00:22:09,180
At the time, Mistress Qiao brought

516
00:22:09,267 --> 00:22:10,467
a large group

517
00:22:10,588 --> 00:22:12,267
to tear down my mother's courtyard.

518
00:22:12,507 --> 00:22:13,707
Now I've returned,

519
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,100
and not only is the courtyard gone,

520
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:16,707
but all the valuable items inside

521
00:22:16,787 --> 00:22:18,188
have disappeared as well.

522
00:22:18,547 --> 00:22:20,588
As for Mistress Qiao's miscarriage,

523
00:22:20,787 --> 00:22:22,668
if I were truly such a cruel person,

524
00:22:22,747 --> 00:22:25,348
there would be no place for me
in Luo's Residence.

525
00:22:26,267 --> 00:22:27,267
Yilian,

526
00:22:27,588 --> 00:22:29,068
if you really feel wronged,

527
00:22:29,188 --> 00:22:30,388
why not speak to the elders

528
00:22:30,467 --> 00:22:31,148
of the family?

529
00:22:31,184 --> 00:22:33,248
Instead, you're crying
and complaining to outsiders.

530
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,580
Are you suggesting

531
00:22:34,707 --> 00:22:35,588
that Luo's Residence

532
00:22:35,668 --> 00:22:37,467
has no place for you

533
00:22:37,547 --> 00:22:39,227
and that everyone favors me?

534
00:22:42,108 --> 00:22:45,148
What are you implying
about the family elders?

535
00:22:45,787 --> 00:22:47,947
And what about
the honor of Luo's Residence?

536
00:22:48,108 --> 00:22:49,668
I did no such thing…

537
00:22:49,787 --> 00:22:51,227
Enough, Yining.

538
00:22:51,307 --> 00:22:53,188
Yilian has been through a lot recently.

539
00:22:53,216 --> 00:22:54,420
After all, she's been locked away

540
00:22:54,432 --> 00:22:55,700
for so long and was just released.

541
00:22:55,908 --> 00:22:57,707
Yixiu, stop.

542
00:23:01,628 --> 00:23:03,388
Yilian and Yining

543
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:05,267
are both virtuous and kind.

544
00:23:05,547 --> 00:23:07,388
This must be a mere misunderstanding.

545
00:23:07,668 --> 00:23:09,148
Since it's a misunderstanding,

546
00:23:09,547 --> 00:23:11,307
we shouldn't dwell on it.

547
00:23:11,428 --> 00:23:12,747
Let's go and enjoy the play.

548
00:23:13,428 --> 00:23:13,787
Let's go.

549
00:23:13,908 --> 00:23:14,868
Ms. Shen.

550
00:23:18,588 --> 00:23:19,668
Oh, you.

551
00:23:20,068 --> 00:23:21,503
I know you're upset,

552
00:23:21,504 --> 00:23:22,520
but you must also consider

553
00:23:22,547 --> 00:23:23,828
the reputation of our family.

554
00:23:24,388 --> 00:23:25,668
You're right.

555
00:23:25,787 --> 00:23:27,188
I was wrong.

556
00:23:27,828 --> 00:23:29,547
I'll be leaving now.

557
00:23:32,428 --> 00:23:33,267
Yixiu.

558
00:23:34,108 --> 00:23:34,628
Come with us.

559
00:23:36,388 --> 00:23:37,307
Sixth Sister,

560
00:23:37,428 --> 00:23:38,707
you've dirtied your dress

561
00:23:38,828 --> 00:23:40,188
with that orange.

562
00:23:40,307 --> 00:23:41,307
Go get a cloak

563
00:23:41,428 --> 00:23:42,108
to cover it up.

564
00:23:42,227 --> 00:23:43,068
Yes.

565
00:23:43,148 --> 00:23:44,467
This is improper.

566
00:23:44,547 --> 00:23:45,068
Come on.

567
00:23:46,668 --> 00:23:47,348
Let's go.

568
00:24:17,188 --> 00:24:17,947
Who are you?

569
00:24:18,428 --> 00:24:19,267
Seize her!

570
00:24:19,507 --> 00:24:20,188
Yes.

571
00:25:27,348 --> 00:25:29,467
Greetings, Marquis.

572
00:25:30,068 --> 00:25:31,947
It's been a long time.

573
00:25:32,467 --> 00:25:34,747
Marquis, I've been framed
and am now a wanted man,

574
00:25:34,868 --> 00:25:35,947
pursued by the authorities.

575
00:25:36,108 --> 00:25:36,987
I fled to the capital,

576
00:25:37,056 --> 00:25:38,208
and I'd nowhere left to turn.

577
00:25:38,307 --> 00:25:40,307
I beg you, for the sake of the service

578
00:25:40,388 --> 00:25:41,588
I've done for you in the past,

579
00:25:41,787 --> 00:25:43,068
to save me.

580
00:25:43,227 --> 00:25:44,947
Cut to the chase. Where is it?

581
00:25:44,976 --> 00:25:45,860
Marquis, if you agree

582
00:25:45,868 --> 00:25:47,388
to arrange for me to escape by sea…

583
00:25:47,467 --> 00:25:48,908
Marquis is here in person.

584
00:25:49,027 --> 00:25:50,787
Of course,
he will agree to your request.

585
00:25:50,868 --> 00:25:51,908
Thank you, Marquis.

586
00:25:52,027 --> 00:25:53,148
Once I board the boat,

587
00:25:53,267 --> 00:25:54,507
I'll hand it over.

588
00:25:54,707 --> 00:25:55,467
How dare you

589
00:25:55,588 --> 00:25:57,023
to bargain with Marquis!

590
00:25:57,024 --> 00:25:57,740
Besides that item,

591
00:25:57,868 --> 00:25:58,787
I have some crucial

592
00:25:58,868 --> 00:25:59,828
information to share

593
00:25:59,856 --> 00:26:00,944
as a sign of my good faith.

594
00:26:02,188 --> 00:26:02,868
Speak.

595
00:26:05,027 --> 00:26:06,547
I only discovered this later.

596
00:26:07,696 --> 00:26:09,056
When Sun Chengwu was interrogated

597
00:26:09,088 --> 00:26:10,300
by the then-Minister of Imperial Court

598
00:26:10,388 --> 00:26:11,628
of Judicial, Old Master Luo,

599
00:26:11,747 --> 00:26:13,108
he left behind a testimony.

600
00:26:13,507 --> 00:26:14,747
But he never revealed it.

601
00:26:14,768 --> 00:26:16,112
It's very likely that the testimony

602
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,780
is still hidden in Luo's Residence.

603
00:26:19,868 --> 00:26:20,668
Qi An.

604
00:26:21,467 --> 00:26:22,747
Take some men and prepare.

605
00:26:23,467 --> 00:26:24,108
Yes.

606
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:38,576
I've kept
this wooden bead bracelet with me

607
00:26:38,787 --> 00:26:40,027
since I was a child.

608
00:26:41,027 --> 00:26:43,428
Since you like it, I'll give it to you.

609
00:26:45,148 --> 00:26:45,828
All right.

610
00:26:46,348 --> 00:26:47,307
I like it.

611
00:26:48,507 --> 00:26:50,227
Mei, when my eyes are healed,

612
00:26:50,307 --> 00:26:51,027
I want you to be

613
00:26:51,148 --> 00:26:52,828
the first person I see.

614
00:27:02,267 --> 00:27:02,908
Marquis,

615
00:27:03,184 --> 00:27:04,980
if you agree to arrange
for me to flee by sea,

616
00:27:05,068 --> 00:27:06,588
I will hand over the item.

617
00:27:06,707 --> 00:27:08,747
Even if I kill you today,

618
00:27:08,987 --> 00:27:10,547
and that item is sent

619
00:27:10,787 --> 00:27:12,467
to Imperial Court of Judicial,

620
00:27:12,588 --> 00:27:13,868
you think

621
00:27:13,868 --> 00:27:14,588
I won't be able

622
00:27:14,787 --> 00:27:16,747
to intercept it?

623
00:27:17,428 --> 00:27:18,108
Come on,

624
00:27:18,128 --> 00:27:20,096
take him away
and bury him somewhere far off.

625
00:27:20,176 --> 00:27:22,016
There are many people
at Yuanjing Pavilion today.

626
00:27:22,048 --> 00:27:23,216
Don't dirty the place.

627
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:23,947
Mercy, Marquis!

628
00:27:24,348 --> 00:27:25,588
Spare me, Marquis!

629
00:27:25,987 --> 00:27:27,348
Have mercy, Marquis! Marquis!

630
00:27:27,467 --> 00:27:28,467
Mercy, Marquis!

631
00:27:28,588 --> 00:27:29,828
Spare me, Marquis!

632
00:27:29,947 --> 00:27:30,747
Marquis!

633
00:27:37,987 --> 00:27:38,547
Get him!

634
00:30:09,547 --> 00:30:10,747
Chase Li Yinglong.

635
00:30:34,467 --> 00:30:35,027
Let's go.

636
00:30:46,908 --> 00:30:47,747
Third Brother!

637
00:30:49,547 --> 00:30:50,267
Come on!

638
00:31:06,307 --> 00:31:06,908
Marquis,

639
00:31:07,188 --> 00:31:08,747
Li Yinglong's men were too cunning.

640
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:09,792
They set a trap beforehand

641
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:10,660
and helped him escape.

642
00:31:10,908 --> 00:31:12,027
It was my failure.

643
00:31:12,267 --> 00:31:14,388
These people are well organized.

644
00:31:14,507 --> 00:31:15,908
They're no ordinary group.

645
00:31:17,307 --> 00:31:19,467
Are you sure they're Li Yinglong's men?

646
00:31:19,908 --> 00:31:21,787
I overheard the leader in black

647
00:31:21,868 --> 00:31:22,987
addressing him as their boss.

648
00:31:23,108 --> 00:31:24,467
If they weren't his close confidants,

649
00:31:24,588 --> 00:31:25,467
how would they know

650
00:31:25,547 --> 00:31:26,507
about our meeting here

651
00:31:26,628 --> 00:31:28,148
and risk their lives to rescue him?

652
00:31:28,388 --> 00:31:30,307
It's possible
that some of Chen Jiuheng's followers

653
00:31:30,507 --> 00:31:33,388
survived after his death.

654
00:31:33,868 --> 00:31:35,148
And if that's the case?

655
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:37,388
They're just a bunch of useless,
weak scholars.

656
00:31:38,512 --> 00:31:40,020
Inform the Imperial Guard that assassins

657
00:31:40,108 --> 00:31:41,747
have infiltrated Yuanjing Pavilion.

658
00:31:42,027 --> 00:31:43,588
Tell them to search
every inch of the area

659
00:31:43,868 --> 00:31:45,908
and find any suspicious individuals.

660
00:32:03,547 --> 00:32:04,787
What are you doing here?

661
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:17,947
Who hurt you?

662
00:32:27,787 --> 00:32:28,908
Who are you?

663
00:32:29,388 --> 00:32:30,507
What were you doing?

664
00:32:30,908 --> 00:32:32,828
What's your connection with them?

665
00:32:36,747 --> 00:32:37,828
I have something

666
00:32:38,908 --> 00:32:39,828
I must do.

667
00:32:39,947 --> 00:32:41,148
Someone you must kill?

668
00:32:45,467 --> 00:32:46,547
Some things

669
00:32:46,987 --> 00:32:48,027
are none of your concern.

670
00:32:48,148 --> 00:32:49,148
No matter what,

671
00:32:49,168 --> 00:32:50,592
you're a member of Luo's Residence.

672
00:32:50,787 --> 00:32:51,588
Whatever you do

673
00:32:51,668 --> 00:32:52,868
will implicate us.

674
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,136
Does anyone in Luo's Residence
even see me as a person?

675
00:32:56,747 --> 00:32:57,868
And you?

676
00:32:58,544 --> 00:33:00,300
If you don't want
to implicate Luo's Residence,

677
00:33:00,388 --> 00:33:01,628
then leave right now.

678
00:33:05,668 --> 00:33:06,987
Do you understand?

679
00:33:08,668 --> 00:33:10,227
Go now.

680
00:33:10,267 --> 00:33:11,267
I can escape on my own.

681
00:33:11,348 --> 00:33:13,027
If you stay, you'll only be a burden.

682
00:33:13,108 --> 00:33:14,027
Leave now.

683
00:33:14,947 --> 00:33:15,588
Get going!

684
00:33:36,227 --> 00:33:37,668
Ungrateful.

685
00:33:44,467 --> 00:33:45,628
He's injured.

686
00:33:47,348 --> 00:33:48,547
Search over there carefully.

687
00:33:48,592 --> 00:33:50,220
Don't let any suspicious person
slip away.

688
00:33:50,348 --> 00:33:50,947
Yes.

689
00:34:11,347 --> 00:34:12,867
How are you so badly hurt?

690
00:34:13,468 --> 00:34:14,548
Why haven't you left yet?

691
00:34:14,628 --> 00:34:15,823
If you die here,

692
00:34:15,824 --> 00:34:17,088
it'll implicate Luo's Residence.

693
00:34:17,136 --> 00:34:18,020
Now get up.

694
00:35:38,588 --> 00:35:39,387
Search over there.

695
00:35:39,588 --> 00:35:40,628
- Yes.
- Yes.

696
00:36:09,205 --> 00:36:11,173
(Luo's Residence)

697
00:36:14,787 --> 00:36:16,827
Mother, calm down.

698
00:36:16,907 --> 00:36:17,907
Calm down.

699
00:36:19,307 --> 00:36:20,347
Remain calm.

700
00:36:20,628 --> 00:36:21,347
Old Madam.

701
00:36:21,427 --> 00:36:22,668
The musk heart-saving pill!

702
00:36:22,704 --> 00:36:23,340
Take it quickly.

703
00:36:23,427 --> 00:36:24,148
Quickly.

704
00:36:24,948 --> 00:36:25,508
There you go.

705
00:36:26,867 --> 00:36:29,227
Mother,
you must take care of your health.

706
00:36:33,267 --> 00:36:34,827
Old Madam. Second Master.

707
00:36:34,907 --> 00:36:35,867
Have you found her?

708
00:36:36,267 --> 00:36:37,988
We've searched all around

709
00:36:38,068 --> 00:36:38,988
Yuanjing Pavilion,

710
00:36:39,108 --> 00:36:40,267
but we still haven't found

711
00:36:40,387 --> 00:36:41,787
Seventh Lady's whereabouts.

712
00:36:41,984 --> 00:36:43,100
What's the point of searching

713
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:43,940
around the perimeter?

714
00:36:43,952 --> 00:36:44,500
Yining must be

715
00:36:44,588 --> 00:36:46,188
inside Yuanjing Pavilion.

716
00:36:46,267 --> 00:36:47,028
Madam Lin,

717
00:36:47,148 --> 00:36:49,108
there were assassins
at Yuanjing Pavilion.

718
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:50,620
The soldiers have surrounded the area,

719
00:36:50,707 --> 00:36:52,468
and we really can't get in.

720
00:36:52,588 --> 00:36:53,668
Assassins?

721
00:36:53,787 --> 00:36:56,188
What about Yining? Yining!

722
00:36:56,508 --> 00:36:59,188
Mother, don't worry too much.

723
00:36:59,267 --> 00:37:01,028
Yining is blessed

724
00:37:01,148 --> 00:37:02,188
and will be safe.

725
00:37:02,427 --> 00:37:04,068
They'll search for their assassins.

726
00:37:04,148 --> 00:37:05,347
We'll find our young lady.

727
00:37:05,427 --> 00:37:06,227
Butler Bai, let's go.

728
00:37:06,227 --> 00:37:06,827
I'll go too.

729
00:37:07,707 --> 00:37:08,628
It's chaos out there.

730
00:37:08,656 --> 00:37:10,080
You'd only be adding to the confusion.

731
00:37:12,148 --> 00:37:12,988
You sisters

732
00:37:13,508 --> 00:37:14,668
were all together.

733
00:37:14,668 --> 00:37:16,227
Why did Yining

734
00:37:16,668 --> 00:37:17,347
suddenly run off

735
00:37:17,347 --> 00:37:18,948
on her own?

736
00:37:21,508 --> 00:37:22,508
Grandma.

737
00:37:22,867 --> 00:37:23,588
We were watching

738
00:37:23,668 --> 00:37:25,347
the play together at first,

739
00:37:25,548 --> 00:37:26,548
but after Yining exchanged

740
00:37:26,668 --> 00:37:27,867
a few words with Ms. Shen,

741
00:37:27,988 --> 00:37:29,548
she said she wanted to go out alone

742
00:37:29,628 --> 00:37:32,508
for some air.

743
00:37:38,668 --> 00:37:39,988
That's true.

744
00:37:44,548 --> 00:37:46,028
It's my fault

745
00:37:46,148 --> 00:37:47,628
for not taking good care

746
00:37:47,747 --> 00:37:48,628
of Yining.

747
00:37:48,747 --> 00:37:49,827
I thought

748
00:37:49,948 --> 00:37:51,188
she'd just cool down

749
00:37:51,307 --> 00:37:53,387
after a walk.

750
00:37:53,588 --> 00:37:56,387
I never expected this to happen.

751
00:37:56,747 --> 00:37:57,668
Yilian,

752
00:37:57,867 --> 00:38:00,468
what's the point of saying this now?

753
00:38:00,747 --> 00:38:03,148
Poor Seventh Lady is out there alone,

754
00:38:03,267 --> 00:38:04,427
and her reputation is at stake.

755
00:38:04,508 --> 00:38:06,148
This is no trivial matter.

756
00:38:06,307 --> 00:38:07,267
If something happens,

757
00:38:07,387 --> 00:38:08,028
what about

758
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,380
the unmarried girls in our family?

759
00:38:09,508 --> 00:38:10,827
What if they get implicated?

760
00:38:10,948 --> 00:38:12,108
Whatever will we do then?

761
00:38:12,188 --> 00:38:12,948
Shut up!

762
00:38:15,988 --> 00:38:17,988
You heartless wretches!

763
00:38:18,227 --> 00:38:19,747
Ever since Yining returned,

764
00:38:19,827 --> 00:38:21,148
how much trouble have you caused?

765
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:22,790
And now you're still
making snide remarks!

766
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:24,068
If Yining isn't found,

767
00:38:24,188 --> 00:38:25,988
I swear I won't let you live peacefully!

768
00:38:26,588 --> 00:38:27,707
Madam Lin,

769
00:38:27,827 --> 00:38:28,747
I assure you,

770
00:38:28,867 --> 00:38:30,188
I'm just as worried.

771
00:38:30,307 --> 00:38:31,508
You speak as if

772
00:38:31,548 --> 00:38:33,508
you're the only one
who cares about Seventh Lady

773
00:38:33,588 --> 00:38:35,188
and the rest of us don't.

774
00:38:35,307 --> 00:38:35,899
As a concubine,

775
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:36,928
you have no place to speak.

776
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:37,740
Old Madam is here.

777
00:38:37,747 --> 00:38:39,548
Is it your turn to talk?

778
00:38:42,668 --> 00:38:44,827
Yining has gone missing,

779
00:38:44,907 --> 00:38:45,867
and everyone is worried.

780
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:47,068
Say no more.

781
00:38:51,267 --> 00:38:53,508
Are you saying that it was Yilian

782
00:38:53,548 --> 00:38:54,427
who incited Yining

783
00:38:54,508 --> 00:38:56,227
to quarrel with Ms. Shen?

784
00:38:56,427 --> 00:38:58,028
I'm not entirely sure.

785
00:38:58,148 --> 00:38:59,747
But I did see Yilian shedding tears

786
00:38:59,867 --> 00:39:00,907
and playing the victim

787
00:39:01,028 --> 00:39:02,427
in front of Ms. Shen.

788
00:39:02,867 --> 00:39:04,907
She might have been bad-mouthing Yining.

789
00:39:06,148 --> 00:39:08,787
And then Yining left on her own?

790
00:39:08,907 --> 00:39:10,307
I wanted to go after her,

791
00:39:10,387 --> 00:39:11,347
but I accidentally

792
00:39:11,427 --> 00:39:12,347
dirtied my clothes.

793
00:39:12,427 --> 00:39:14,108
Then Yilian insisted

794
00:39:14,307 --> 00:39:15,028
on finding me

795
00:39:15,148 --> 00:39:16,108
a cloak

796
00:39:16,227 --> 00:39:17,427
to cover up with.

797
00:39:17,747 --> 00:39:19,068
By the time

798
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:20,068
I returned,

799
00:39:20,148 --> 00:39:21,588
Yining was already gone.

800
00:39:21,948 --> 00:39:22,827
Then why didn't you

801
00:39:22,948 --> 00:39:24,307
say this earlier?

802
00:39:24,548 --> 00:39:26,068
My mother kept telling us

803
00:39:26,188 --> 00:39:27,827
not to get involved in others' business,

804
00:39:28,028 --> 00:39:29,468
so I didn't dare speak up.

805
00:39:29,707 --> 00:39:31,227
Second Aunt, please don't tell anyone

806
00:39:31,347 --> 00:39:31,988
I said this,

807
00:39:32,016 --> 00:39:33,968
or I'll be made to copy
the Women's Precepts again.

808
00:39:34,427 --> 00:39:36,907
Don't worry. You've done well.

809
00:39:37,227 --> 00:39:38,468
I'll be going now.

810
00:39:38,747 --> 00:39:39,948
Goodbye, Second Aunt.

811
00:39:42,988 --> 00:39:45,347
That mother and daughter pair

812
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:46,988
truly have hearts as black as coal.

813
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,812
(Bilian Pavilion)

814
00:40:11,588 --> 00:40:12,907
Bi Yi, you may leave.

815
00:40:12,988 --> 00:40:15,267
Madam Lin and Mistress Qiao
have something to discuss.

816
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:25,148
You…

817
00:40:28,307 --> 00:40:29,508
Madam,

818
00:40:29,628 --> 00:40:31,588
has Seventh Lady returned?

819
00:40:35,347 --> 00:40:36,867
If Yining had returned,

820
00:40:36,988 --> 00:40:38,508
would I be here talking to you?

821
00:40:38,747 --> 00:40:40,227
Where is Yining?

822
00:40:40,548 --> 00:40:41,948
Don't just pin everything on me

823
00:40:42,028 --> 00:40:44,227
because you can't find her.

824
00:40:44,387 --> 00:40:46,347
What did Yining and Ms. Shen

825
00:40:46,668 --> 00:40:47,948
argue about, huh?

826
00:40:48,628 --> 00:40:50,427
If it weren't for Yilian instigating,

827
00:40:50,496 --> 00:40:52,864
how would Ms. Shen have known
about Luo's Residence affairs?

828
00:40:53,387 --> 00:40:54,787
Yining left on her own,

829
00:40:54,867 --> 00:40:56,427
and Yilian held back Sixth Lady

830
00:40:56,548 --> 00:40:57,827
from going to find her,

831
00:40:58,068 --> 00:40:59,867
which left Yining alone.

832
00:40:59,988 --> 00:41:01,707
I refuse to believe
that you have no idea

833
00:41:01,787 --> 00:41:03,387
what happened after that.

834
00:41:03,468 --> 00:41:05,307
Believe what you will.

835
00:41:05,468 --> 00:41:06,668
I said I don't know,

836
00:41:06,787 --> 00:41:07,867
so I don't…

837
00:41:10,347 --> 00:41:11,588
Will you talk or not?

838
00:41:13,188 --> 00:41:14,707
I said I don't know.

839
00:41:15,628 --> 00:41:17,267
Do you know or do you not know?

840
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:18,907
Do you know or do you not know?

841
00:41:20,992 --> 00:41:21,860
Do you know or not?

842
00:41:21,948 --> 00:41:22,387
Lin Hairu!

843
00:41:22,468 --> 00:41:23,787
You're going too far!

844
00:41:26,032 --> 00:41:27,300
I'm going to find Second Master!

845
00:41:27,312 --> 00:41:28,544
I'm going to find Second Master!

846
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,460
You… You…

847
00:41:31,504 --> 00:41:33,540
Madam Lin and Mistress Qiao
are merely having a chat.

848
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:34,820
Why bring Second Master into this?

849
00:41:35,068 --> 00:41:35,628
You…

850
00:41:36,108 --> 00:41:38,188
I may be just a concubine,

851
00:41:38,747 --> 00:41:40,747
but I've given birth
to a son and a daughter!

852
00:41:40,827 --> 00:41:43,068
I've poured my heart and soul
into the second home!

853
00:41:43,108 --> 00:41:43,747
Don't think

854
00:41:43,827 --> 00:41:44,827
you can bully me

855
00:41:44,832 --> 00:41:46,290
just because you're the principal wife.

856
00:41:46,787 --> 00:41:47,747
I've tolerated you,

857
00:41:47,827 --> 00:41:50,068
and yielded to you,

858
00:41:50,148 --> 00:41:52,188
but don't push me too far.

859
00:41:52,307 --> 00:41:53,508
Do you hear me?

860
00:41:56,227 --> 00:41:57,148
Tolerated me?

861
00:41:58,267 --> 00:42:00,468
You're just harboring ill intentions.

862
00:42:00,827 --> 00:42:02,108
Where is Yining?

863
00:42:03,227 --> 00:42:04,787
I told you, I don't know.

864
00:42:07,628 --> 00:42:08,188
Do you think

865
00:42:08,307 --> 00:42:10,148
I'm some kind of soft principal wife?

866
00:42:12,307 --> 00:42:13,948
I couldn't bother
to deal with you before,

867
00:42:14,028 --> 00:42:15,588
and now you've become too brazen.

868
00:42:15,668 --> 00:42:17,028
Let me make this clear.

869
00:42:17,267 --> 00:42:19,827
I'm not someone you can provoke.

870
00:42:20,668 --> 00:42:22,347
You're just pretentious

871
00:42:22,427 --> 00:42:23,188
and full of air.

872
00:42:23,307 --> 00:42:24,948
You're no educated woman.

873
00:42:25,028 --> 00:42:26,347
You're nothing but trouble.

874
00:42:26,352 --> 00:42:27,060
