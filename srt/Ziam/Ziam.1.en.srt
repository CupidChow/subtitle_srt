Doctor, what the hell is going on?
What is wrong with those people?

470
00:36:48,375 --> 00:36:51,750
[doctor] We have limited information.
The situation's still unclear.

471
00:36:51,833 --> 00:36:55,625
[man 20] If our public health officials
don't even know, then who does?

472
00:36:55,708 --> 00:36:58,250
[man 21] We should send in a team
to shoot them and end this.

473
00:36:58,333 --> 00:37:00,875
[man 22] And how exactly
are you gonna tell who's who?

474
00:37:00,958 --> 00:37:04,291
Well, send in the doctors with the team.
I'm sure they can tell who's who.

475

I won't send in my team to die like this.

477

What's the total population of Bangkok?

478

We must be rational.

486
00:37:38,291 --> 00:37:40,416
Blowing up that hospital
is the only option.

487
00:37:42,583 --> 00:37:45,666
We will do this for the greater good.
