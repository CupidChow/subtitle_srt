Now , you 're

29
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,000
You're dreaming , fly

Now , focus your mind
to yourself , forget the others .

33
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,000
The man in front of me like
men in general , relaxed and
always thinking about sex .

34
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I 've been used to seeing
things like this.

35
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Maybe he was looming
image of the girl of his dreams .

36
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Yes , how to pack ?
so sit his case ...

37
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000

If you say so ...

38

Makeup artist! What is wrong with her
dressed like this ?

39
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Why?
It's been great .

40
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Check your breasts look
less prominent .

41
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,000
It should look challenging
and stand out , like this .

42
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
What are you doing?

43
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,200
Do not believe?!
Try standing .

44
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
See this ass ,
less steady .

45
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,600

00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,200
Look, my job photographing
something ordinary into the extraordinary .

47
00:09:11,205 --> 00:09:16,000
If forced , the same as the sale of food
on a side street but did not sell .

48
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
If you hold once again ,
I guarantee you, you'll regret it .

49
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Basic obscene , or do you want
kucubit to tear your face ?

50
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I'm just trying to direct
so your picture looks good and sexy .

00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,000

good posture
and potential .

53
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
If it looks ordinary ,
all of this will be in vain .

54
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
You understand !?

55
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,200

in making money .

77

What are you doing?

78
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,100
Why are you silent?

79
00:11:54,175 --> 00:11:56,375
Hospitals know !

80
00:11:57,415 --> 00:11:58,615
Did you eat yet ?

81
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,000
All day just playing device .

Eat fast , I will go

83
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:15,000
You're too quick surrender

Ha - joo , do not rush ,

87
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Let us eat.

88
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
We eat at home.
You prepare the sprouts .

89
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Basics are you, still
acting like a child ...

90
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:41,025
Sopanlah bit , now
He was brother -in-law .

91
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:44,400
Let's eat.

92
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:48,075
Sister , you would not know ,
eat sprouts
currently popular now .

93
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:51,025
It looks like you did not know ?
Turns out you're already old .

94
00:12:51,031 --> 00:12:54,031
What did you say ... ?

95
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,100
The old couple like you
although already married ...

96
00:12:58,125 --> 00:13:01,699
certainly not semesra
as a young couple .

97
00:13:02,985 --> 00:13:04,985
Dear ...

98
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Sister , just give him
a bunch of flowers .

99
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,000
A toast to happiness
and together we all .

100
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Very delicious.

101
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:36,000
It's late , it seems now
time for a married couple .

102
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Look at the happy faces you.

103
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:53,000
In general , the human heart like bread ,
Looks hard but it's really fragile.

104
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,000
My job was protect it .

105
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Do not you destroy ya .

106
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Life is supposed to do
think too much about the problem .

107
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:20,700
Especially live together with you guys ,
surely happiness will always
come over.

108
00:14:20,725 --> 00:14:22,725
Correct Kak ?

109
00:14:24,885 --> 00:14:27,885
Unfortunately until now
yet there are people who love me .

110
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,200
Do not talk like that.

111
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
Indeed, the fact is like this .

112
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,300
Maybe my expectations are too high , but ....

113
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:44,000
Unfortunately , I have not found
people who deserve to be loved,
like brother -in-law .

114
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
It's okay , maybe ...

115
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,000
I should try dating
with women.

116
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Basic!

117
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
OK ...

118
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I used to think , the beauty of women
is point number one.

119
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Finally I realized , beauty is not
an important thing, but the feeling of love .

120
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:20,000
Find people like my sister 's beautiful ,
he could accept what is.

121
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:28,600
Sudah, jangan terlalu dipikirkan,
kebahagiaan adalah sebuah
anugerah kehidupan.

122
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:36,800
Kalau diingat, semasa kecil
ketika bermain, kau selalu kalah.

123
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,300
Dulu aku memang sengaja
mengalah, tapi sekarang lihat ...

124
00:15:42,325 --> 00:15:46,125
kau sudah dewasa, masih suka pamer
seperti anak kecil.

125
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:48,650
Akui saja
jika memang kalah.

126
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:06,875
^.^ Translated by NƩR0  ^.^

127
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Honey, what are you doing ?

128
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Yeah , I'm going down !

129
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Are you busy ?

130
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Wait a minute .

131
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:18,650
I finish first yes .

132
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,000
OK.

133
00:19:49,055 --> 00:19:51,055
Really sucks .

134
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,000
Miss Ha - yeong , thanks
has been willing to interview me.

135
00:20:18,025 --> 00:20:21,025
What are you planning to advance
yourselves in the future ?

136
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:33,000
There are no special tricks ,
look at this contract .

137
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,400
Very boring.

138
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,000
I've never lost a customer .
On the contrary , I was very popular .

139
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
What do you think?

140
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:54,000
They often gave me a gift , just
to get a queue number , I'm happy

141
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,000
Business is pretty smooth .

142
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,900
You know , what's the point of beauty
In a business like this ?

143
00:21:02,225 --> 00:21:05,799
Beauty is also a
advertising covertly .

144
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:10,875
It could even be helpful in addition to
get clothes for free .

145
00:21:11,115 --> 00:21:15,315
If the problem is they are not finished ,
they will definitely come back again .

146
00:21:23,775 --> 00:21:27,075
How, still there
you want to ask ?

147
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,984
I will try
give you the best answer .

148
00:21:31,685 --> 00:21:36,285
Or maybe you have
problems in a relationship .

149
00:21:37,785 --> 00:21:41,885
Do you know? Emotions are aspects
primary in a relationship.

150
00:21:42,035 --> 00:21:44,035
If you really like it ...

151
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,360
I can give
a few tips for you .

152
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:53,300
For example , there is a man acquainted with you
so I can sleep with you.

153
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:03,000
If he's not your type ,
just answer emphatically , no .

154
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Conversely , if you think quite handsome ,
do not be shy , tell him themselves .

155
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:18,000
How to
the conquest of a man ?

156
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
A handsome man ?

157
00:22:19,085 --> 00:22:20,485
Handsome man?

158
00:22:21,675 --> 00:22:24,385
Lower your voice, then
Whisper ketelinga the man ...

159
00:22:24,415 --> 00:22:26,915
You want to make love ?

160

There is a need what kak

162
00:23:04,155 --> 00:23:06,155

163
00:23:10,575 --> 00:23:12,575
I'll get a cup of coffee .

164
00:23:12,775 --> 00:23:13,775
Maria ...

165
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Actually , I 'm just curious ...

166

You think I'm a man like that ?
I'm just too busy working !

169
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Therapy can also relieve
work pressure .

170
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
I told you
I'm healthy !

171
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,700
You want me to therapy

172
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,300
You're just going to
make me shy!

173
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,500
It seems like just you
who need therapy !

174
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:56,950
In medicine, it
not taboo.

175
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Ha-yeong.

between fantasy and reality ,
the cause.

00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:58,000
In imaginary everything is beautiful ,
but the reality is different .

275
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:05,000
We should be quick in
facing problems
like this.

But it seems fate

403
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:47,000
OK.

404
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:53,300
Woo-seong?

405
01:09:54,057 --> 01:09:55,357
Ha-yeong ...

406
01:16:32,228 --> 01:16:34,228
Sister ... ?

407
01:16:35,025 --> 01:16:37,025
Woo-seong?

408
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:43,000
Where are they?

409
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:42,500
Since childhood , we live together and
mutually dependent on one another .

410
01:17:43,025 --> 01:17:45,425
Indeed I was seeking help
for problem my husband.

411
01:17:46,050 --> 01:17:48,699

What happens , this may be my destiny .

Have you eaten?

415
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,800
Brother, I'm sorry,
all my fault .

416
01:19:19,835 --> 01:19:24,435
Since the first therapy I already know ,
This should all not be allowed to happen .

417
01:19:24,875 --> 01:19:29,575
Even in the event of your marriage ,
I once told him
"Do not you hurt my brother " .

418
01:19:29,700 --> 01:19:33,200
You remember kak ?

419
01:19:33,325 --> 01:19:35,325

420
01:19:37,350 --> 01:19:40,650
But , actually I
which hurt kak .

421
01:19:43,675 --> 01:19:47,175
I just wanted to help
and save your marriage .

422
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:50,100
I'd suspect
and find out.

423
01:19:50,725 --> 01:19:56,925
Yet it is precisely during therapy ,
I fell in love with him .

424
01:19:59,950 --> 01:20:01,950
Ha-yeong

425
01:20:01,975 --> 01:20:04,375
Anyway , all already occurred .

426
01:20:05,400 --> 01:20:08,400
You're my brother and all of this ,
My figure a better understanding of my husband .

427
01:20:09,325 --> 01:20:11,325
And never you
me feel guilty .

428
01:20:13,385 --> 01:20:16,585
Already yes , beware
on the road,

429
01:20:17,610 --> 01:20:19,610

430
01:20:21,050 --> 01:20:23,050
Well Kak ,
See you later.

431
01:20:49,775 --> 01:20:51,775
Party! Tell me where
the party goes on !

432
01:20:52,025 --> 01:20:54,125
Basic you this ! you see
I'm currently working out !

433
01:20:54,135 --> 01:20:56,435
I know this week

434
01:20:56,460 --> 01:20:59,060
Why, do you want to come ?
Without a ticket , you can not enter.

435
01:20:59,085 --> 01:21:01,085
Then , quickly give me
entry ticket !

436
01:21:01,110 --> 01:21:03,410
Wait , why are you suddenly
interested in coming to the party ?

437
01:21:03,435 --> 01:21:05,735
You could ask the party ticket
to the man there.

438
01:21:09,355 --> 01:21:11,855
Please give
entry ticket !

439
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:26,000
Had been to
mask party?

440
01:21:27,055 --> 01:21:31,955
Not yet , anyway for what
we come to a party like this ?

441
01:21:41,725 --> 01:21:42,799
In fact ...

442
01:21:42,824 --> 01:21:45,724
We should not
come to this party

443
01:21:45,749 --> 01:21:50,149
Regarding your brother , to be honest
I apologize to you.

444
01:21:50,174 --> 01:21:52,074
No thought , he went
leaving home.

445
01:21:53,699 --> 01:21:55,699
Looks like I have
hurt him .

446
01:21:58,699 --> 01:22:02,899
I love him , but I do not know
what else.

447
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:05,000
Come , let us go down .

448
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:28,000
For you.

449
01:22:31,000 --> 01:22:32,700
What's this ?

450
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:40,000
This mask to hide
identity and strengthen character.

451
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:48,000
It is also part of the therapy ,
satisfy the imagination and ego

452
01:22:48,974 --> 01:22:50,974
Imagination?

453
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,600
Imagination what
you mean ?

454
01:22:52,747 --> 01:22:55,347
Later you will find out
own answers.

455
01:22:55,372 --> 01:22:57,372
Hurry ...

456
01:22:57,572 --> 01:22:59,572
Remove the glasses and
you wear the mask .

457
01:23:02,397 --> 01:23:06,097
Then you just go ahead ,
I'll soon follow .

Forgive brother , already
makes you anxious .

462
01:29:07,822 --> 01:29:12,622
I think all of this will end ,
when I left home .

463
01:29:14,647 --> 01:29:17,747
Brother, I 'm sorry .

464
01:29:19,572 --> 01:29:22,372
Heaven also must be
punished ....

465
01:29:23,672 --> 01:29:27,872
if I hurt
sister feeling like this .

466
01:29:32,822 --> 01:29:36,122
You know , I'm not going
Never blame you .

467
01:29:37,847 --> 01:29:40,447
But I do not think , if
Boo Woo - Sung could do it .

468
01:29:44,072 --> 01:29:48,472
I just do not want , what he experienced ,
becomes more severe .

469
01:29:52,397 --> 01:29:58,497
But I ignore what
I think over the years, until finally
I myself was not strong.

470
01:29:58,522 --> 01:30:00,522
Forgive me kak ....

471
01:30:04,547 --> 01:30:06,547
Never mind ...

472
01:32:17,572 --> 01:32:20,572
It was unexpected ,
you could be this good .

473
01:32:20,597 --> 01:32:22,897
As if not
like you.

474
01:32:22,922 --> 01:32:24,622
I really
enjoy it.

475
01:32:27,922 --> 01:32:29,922
But ...

476
01:32:29,953 --> 01:32:31,552
Why should it be like this?

477
01:32:32,577 --> 01:32:35,577
Do you know , all these
because I love you!

478
01:32:42,602 --> 01:32:44,602
I was wrong .

479
01:32:48,627 --> 01:32:52,927
It was true , you love
is my brother , not me !!

480
01:32:59,515 --> 01:33:04,415
Actually, all of this has been
planned by Ha - yeong .

481
01:33:06,440 --> 01:33:08,840
Woo-seong ...

482
01:33:12,065 --> 01:33:15,565
At first I refused ,
but Ha - yeong insisted .

483
01:33:16,590 --> 01:33:19,290
It turned out that all of this is
the final session of therapy .

484
01:33:20,315 --> 01:33:22,915
Ha - yeong did not want
see our separate ways.

485
01:33:26,940 --> 01:33:28,940
Now I will go .

486
01:33:30,965 --> 01:33:34,165
After the departure day, I hope
you can beat the devil in your heart.

487
01:33:41,077 --> 01:33:43,577
I know you will
afford to go through all of this .

488
01:33:45,875 --> 01:33:48,475
Because I know
you can afford.

489
01:34:54,597 --> 01:34:57,097
Cheers .... !!!

490
01:35:06,122 --> 01:35:08,322
