How can you eat rabbits?

350
00:17:15,609 --> 00:17:16,160
It's delicious.

351

You...

352
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,359
You are the dumpest man in the world!

Hello?

Anyone there?

363
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:02,750
He's about this tall.

364
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,840
And he has a scar

365
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:05,360
on his face right here.

366
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:07,440
Did you see his face?

He's strong.

It's him.

Let me do it.

383
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:52,670
This must be the stolen goods left by Yu Yidao.

384
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:55,400
I thought this case would be difficult.

385
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,400
I didn't expect

386
00:18:56,430 --> 00:18:57,840
to get a big clue so soon.

Here, Manyi.

388
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,600
You're one step closer to become

Feng State's No.1 Imperial Censor.

390
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:13,140
But to be honest,

391
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,270
I'm confused.

392
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:15,910
If this case

393
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:17,590
had been this easy,

394
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:20,340
why would they have sent us all the way here?

People in Fuzhou like sweet food.

You probably won't like the food here.

There must be something you like.

00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:09,400
This time, I won't give in.

412

Manyi is mine.

413
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,410
Manyi belongs to no one

00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,060
Manyi, try the fish.

418
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:24,120
Try this.

I want...

420
00:20:29,850 --> 00:20:30,470
I want...

421
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:31,510
I want...

422
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,920
I want...

423
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,670
You two, stop it!

424
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:39,850
It's just a meal.

425
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,540
You don’t need to have a fight.

426
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:44,820
Your Highness, it’s inappropriate for you

427
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:46,330
to take someone else's food.

428
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:49,180
No one was eating it. Therefore I didn't take it

429
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,390
from anyone.

430
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:52,940
It's a competition at most.

431
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,050
Manyi.

432
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:03,070
Neither of you want to eat, huh?

433
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,300
Fine.

434
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,800
Let's get down to business!

435
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:09,270
The testimony,

436
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:10,220
the portrait

437
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:11,850
and the murder weapon

438
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:14,480
all point to Yu Yidao.

439
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:17,760
Looks like he's without doubt the murderer.

440
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,220
Don't you think it's strange?

441
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,110
What do you mean?

442
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:22,910
You're right.

443
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:27,430
The portrait is surprisingly consistent with the testimony.

444
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:29,070
Yes.

445
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,680
People's points of view on the same thing

446
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,210
and the same person

447
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:35,290
are affected by subjective factors.

448
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,290
They are bound to differ.

449
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:39,610
It's almost impossible to be identical.

450
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:40,230
Unless...

451
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,210
Unless they have worked out all the details

452
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:43,360
in advance.

453
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,120
Yes.

454
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,590
I think

455
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:47,990
we need to

456
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,270
see for ourselves.

457
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:51,000
We have to go deeper

458
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,500
to know the whole story.

459
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,040
This case is getting interesting.

460
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,180
It seems that finding him

461
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,260
is the only way we can get to the truth.

462
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,490
All the main roads in Fuzhou

463
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:04,120
are guarded by soldiers

464
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:05,660
in case refugees get around.

465
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,000
He needs a permit

466
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,230
to leave.

467
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,200
Yu Yidao must

468
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:11,890
still be in Fuzhou.

469
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:14,760
I'll post a reward for his whereabouts.

470
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,490
I'm sure we'll find him.

471
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,730
There are hundreds of thousands of people in Fuzhou.

472
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:21,520
It'll be like looking for a needle in a haystack.

473
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:23,720
We must find a way

474
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,410
to lure him out.

475
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:27,900
My Lords!

476
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:29,670
Go ahead.

477
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,540
Lord He sent me to inform you

478
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:34,010
we have captured Yu Yidao's accomplices.

479
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:34,920
Go get your reward.

480
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,980
Thank you, My Lord.

481
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,480
The bait's ready.

482
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:43,230
Now it's up to the fish to bite the hook.

483
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,730
Run!

484
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,180
Wang, come with me.

485
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:11,160
You've lost.

486
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,540
Surrender now.

487
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:13,440
You should know

488
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:14,260
you're helping an evil man.

489
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:16,240
Leaving you on this earth is a scourge to the people.

490
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,770
What are you talking about?

491
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,000
He's gone.

492
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:27,940
He managed to escape?

493
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:28,730
Go after him!

494
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:28,980
Yes!

495
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,840
Anyone who can catch

496
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:31,830
Yu Yidao

497
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,460
will be rewarded 1000 taels of gold.

498
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,320
Wait.

499
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:35,820
Well...

500
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,300
You don't have to go through so much trouble.

501
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:41,730
I have put a special spice

502
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,410
on the patrol wagon.

503
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,960
The bandit must have got it on his coat.

504
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,000
We can just send hunting dogs

505
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,230
to trace the scent.

506
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:55,180
My Lord, I've got something.

507
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,710
You guys wait outside.

508
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:08,540
No one acts without my order.

509
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,300
Mayor He.

510
00:24:12,710 --> 00:24:14,770
Open the door for the Imperial Envoy.

511
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:33,390
Manyi?

512
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,890
Freeze! Hands up!

513
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,440
They are just ordinary people.

514
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,140
They're not bandits.

515
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,400
Did we get the wrong location?

516
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:01,890
Come at me.

517
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,520
Don't hurt innocent people.

518
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,160
The bandit still

519
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,520
cares about the people at this moment?

520
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,080
Sir.

521
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,020
There are many questions about the Fuzhou case.

522
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,680
The witnesses's testimonies

523
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:24,570
and the evidence all seem prearranged.

524
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:27,880
If you can give us some clues,

525
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:30,370
we can make things right as soon as possible.

526
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:32,780
We are not people who stand facts on their heads.

527
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:35,090
It's all for justice.

528
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:42,910
[Order]

529
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,930
I’m the Fifth Prince of Feng State.

530
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,150
If you still don't believe

531
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:41,110
our sincerity,

532
00:25:41,530 --> 00:25:42,770
take me hostage.

533
00:25:48,110 --> 00:25:49,670
I am Yu Yidao.

534
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,460
He Lian

535
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:56,980
did all of it.

536
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,770
The word is He Lian was ordered by someone powerful in the capital

537
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:03,170
to look for the treasure.

538
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:05,760
So he forced people to dig the dyke,

539
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,880
which led to the breach

540
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,020
and caused a disaster.

541
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:09,500
Hurry!

542
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,890
Hurry!

543
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,550
What are you doing?

544
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:15,370
Hurry!

545
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:18,850
Then He Lian tried to get rid of them

546
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,170
to cover it up

547
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:21,820
so that he could keep his job.

548
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:23,700
I happened to be traveling here.

549
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,220
I couldn't bear to see them die,

550
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,080
so I saved them.

551
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:29,230
That's why he accused me of banditry.

552
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,510
I want to kill that scoundrel

553
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:36,020
to seek justice for those who died in vain.

554
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,050
And Wang, who is still in prison.

555
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:41,610
He just said something fair

556
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:43,170
as the head of laborers.

557
00:26:48,090 --> 00:26:49,740
I would gladly die

558
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:51,220
if I could bring justice

559
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:52,400
to the people.

560
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:53,980
Please help us.

561
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:54,810
Please help us.

562
00:26:54,810 --> 00:26:55,990
Please help us.

563
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,150
-Please get up.
-Please help us.

564
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,340
Please help us.

565
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,550
Please help us.

566
00:26:59,550 --> 00:26:59,990
Please get up.

567
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:00,840
Get up.

568
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,510
-Get up.
-Get up.

569
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,320
Please get up.

570
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,250
Don't worry.

571
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:09,300
I swear

572
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:11,860
I will clear your names

573
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,980
and bring He Lian to justice.

574
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:14,950
I'll do my best

575
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:16,130
for my country and the people.

576
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:17,260
I won't let you down.

577
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,210
Me too.

578
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:19,070
Manyi's business

579
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:19,930
is my business.

580
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:21,920
Thank you, My Lords.

581
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:23,460
Thank you, My Lords.

582
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:25,610
My Lords,

583
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:28,660
I've got a lot of guards here.

584
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,790
We'll keep you safe

585
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:34,810
even if we fight to the death.

586
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:36,920
That old fox

587
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:39,790
wants to kill by our hands.

588
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:43,860
We've known the truth.

589
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:45,290
And you're the Imperial Envoy.

590
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:46,850
We should just go confront him.

591
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:47,410
No.

592
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,680
Mayor He's power is entrenched

593
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:50,900
in Fuzhou.

594
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,860
If we act rashly,

595
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,660
we'll only make him want

596
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,520
to kill us.

597
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,150
Then he'll put the blame

598
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:01,190
on the bandit.

599
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,350
He'll lose his job at most,

600
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,350
but we'll die.

601
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:10,930
Right!

602
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:13,130
You're a bandit.

603
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:22,910
On my order.

604
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:25,410
If anything happens...

605
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:32,140
Don't move!

606
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:33,880
Tell your men to back off,

607
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:35,370
or I'll kill her.

608
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:37,400
Back off!

609
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,230
So what if you kill me?

610
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:45,510
Mayor He is a good officer.

611
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:47,770
He'll bring you to justice.

612
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:48,560
Shut up!

613
00:28:49,910 --> 00:28:51,550
She's the Imperial Envoy.

614
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:54,380
And he's the Fifth Prince.

615
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:56,250
If anything happens to them in Fuzhou,

616
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:57,100
I'm afraid

617
00:28:57,910 --> 00:28:59,510
you can't handle the responsibility.

618
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:01,380
Yu Yidao, let the Fifth Prince

619
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,630
and the Imperial Envoy go.

620
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:04,800
We can talk this out.

621
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:05,520
Let them go?

622
00:29:06,950 --> 00:29:09,240
They are my free pass.

623
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,160
Back off!

624
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,420
Back off!

625
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:14,350
Back off!

626
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,750
What are you waiting for?

627
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,920
-Go!
-Go!

628
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:27,100
Protect the Fifth Prince!

629
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,200
They will kill her.

630
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,120
Mayor He,

631
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,650
you must keep the bigger picture in mind.

632
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:33,380
Don't hurt the Imperial Envoy.

633
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:35,030
What are you waiting for?

634
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,650
Go after them!

635
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:39,000
Let them go. I'll give you a ransom.

636
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,270
What are you doing?

637
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:45,960
Get out of my way!

638
00:29:46,230 --> 00:29:47,110
Mr. Yu.

639
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,830
Take the money to buy them food and medicine.

640
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:54,340
I appreciate it on behalf on them.

641
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:55,630
You're welcome.

642
00:29:58,090 --> 00:29:59,260
May I know

643
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:00,730
your name?

644
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,200
I'm Wen Chenyi.

645
00:30:05,590 --> 00:30:06,900
May I ask you,

646
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,910
is your grandfather Wen Xian?

647
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:10,970
Yes.

648
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,900
Do you have anything to prove it?

649
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:19,700
My grandfather gave me this jade pendant.

650
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,240
Your grandfather helped my grandparents a lot.

651
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,320
They followed him.

652
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:27,330
Before your grandfather retired,

653
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:28,830
he buried some secret treasure in Fuzhou

654
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:31,490
and asked my family to guard it for generations.

655
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:32,650
Secret treasure?

656
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:37,630
Is that what Mayor He is looking for?
