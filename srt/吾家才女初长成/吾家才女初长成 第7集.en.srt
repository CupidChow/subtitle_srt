It looks so good.

00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:41,070
So beautiful.

See?

00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:53,270
Manyi's style is unique

00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:54,270
and has a school of her own.

9
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:56,430
She deserved the name of Feng State's No. 1 Beauty.

Goddess Manyi.

11
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:59,220
Can I borrow your Qiao Dress to use as a reference?

12
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,110
Goddess Manyi.

13
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:02,190
I want to copy your entire outfit.

14
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:03,630
Yes.

15
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:04,510
I'm sorry.

16
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,310
I'm not considering making a sample

17
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,390
or copying.

18
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,310
We are only considering exclusive customization.

19
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:11,840
Exclusive customization?

20
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,829
I want one.

21

No problem.

25
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,110
Okay.

Here.

27
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:30,150
It's good to see Young Madam so happy.

28
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,110
It makes Young Master's effort in

After today's class is over,

don't forget to send Young Madam to that place.

33
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,070
Don't worry, Young Master.

34
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:42,490
I've told Dongqing

35
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,420
to prepare the second surprise for Young Madam

36
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:44,910
properly.

37
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,230
Cheng Manyi. We paid the deposit.

38
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,550
Can you guarantee that the delivery will be on time?

Yes.

Can you guarantee to be on time?

41
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,390
Of course.

42
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,530
I'm in a favorable position thanks to the royal family.

43

Where is Feng Qiwu?

45
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:58,190
I haven't seen him today.

46
00:02:58,290 --> 00:02:59,310
What should we do?

47
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:01,150
If we can't get the Qiao Dress on time,

48
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,150
what is the point?

49
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,380
Don't worry. Leave it to me.

50
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:07,880

52
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,750
Miss, Young Master is unavailable to meet guests today.

53
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,230
Please come another day.

54
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,100
I'm here to make a fortune with him.

55
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,310
You still can't meet him today.

56
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,440
Miss, please leave.

57
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:20,510
Wait.

58
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:22,610
Did something happen?

59
00:03:24,430 --> 00:03:25,680
Don't close the door until you make it clear.

60
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,670
You have no idea.

61
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,290
Today is the anniversary of Young Master's biological mother's passing.

62
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:32,560
Every year on this day,

63
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:34,750
Young Master locks himself in the mansion,

64
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,270
avoiding all visitors

65
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,570

66
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,180
Miss, please go back.

67

68
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,780
What should we do?

69
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,930
The students are still waiting.

70
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:56,070
Manyi, I have something to do later.

71
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:57,960
I can't see you off.

72
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:00,010
Liu, see Manyi off.

73
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:06,190
Dongqing, return the entire deposit

74
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,580

75
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,990
and provide them with double the compensation.

76
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:11,720
Tell them we can't deliver the Qiao Dress on time.

77
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:13,900
That's a lot of money.

78
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,470
Money is small; losing trust is significant.

79
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:17,579
But...

80
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,970
But the Young Master is still waiting.

81
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:21,779
I almost forgot about him.

82
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,220
This is the only way.

343
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:19,480
I don't know what to do now.

344
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,960
What?

345
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,170
You lost Manyi?

346
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:27,090
Don't worry. She can't escape my eagle eyes.

347
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:30,320
Why does Cui Jun

348
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,640
get so worked up when he hears about Manyi?

349
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,280
Don't tell me that he hasn't given up.

350
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,090
Thank God.

351
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:37,490
Thanks to Manyi for giving me a chance

352
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:40,270
to show myself in front of my goddess.

353
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:41,680
I have to do my best.

Thank you.

358
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:10,060
At the beginning of the Double Seventh Festival,

359
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,130
we launched

360
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,300
the silhouette guessing game.

361
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:15,560
The so-called silhouette guessing game is that

362
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,890
a woman will not show her face

363
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,440
but her silhouette on a folding screen.

364
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:23,450
The person a man finds based on the shadow

365
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:26,230
is his destined one.

366
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:29,390
Sir, how to participate?

367
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:32,000
Actually, the participants

368
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,270
have already been chosen

Please take a look at your token.

pair up with you.

385
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:07,480
But can you recognize me based on the silhouette?

386
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,120
It's simple.

387
00:20:09,890 --> 00:20:11,360
Easy said than done.

388
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:13,530
If you don't recognize me,

389
00:20:13,630 --> 00:20:14,390
I will...

390
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:15,950
What?

391
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,290
I'll do whatever I want.

392
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:19,930
The lucky ladies

393
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:21,760

please wait to come to the stage.

403
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,550
I've remembered her dress and posture.

It will be easy for me to find my goddess.

405

Now, try to find her!

That's her, right?

408

He'll think of me as her, right?

409
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:24,730
Who will be my destined one?

410
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,710
Will he recognize me?

My goddess likes drawing.

00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:35,870
One of them is writing and the other is holding the drawing board.

It is thriving just like the past.

In order to entertain the people,

we've specially added a poetry battle.

It's such a classical and elegant custom.

The poem says, "The wine cup goes with the flow."

463

The bamboo tube has already been set to flow with water.

464
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:12,200
The wine cup flows from the top

465

and slowly flows down.

466
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:16,490
When the cup stops in front of you,

467
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:18,990
you have to make a poem.

468
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:20,440
If you can't compose a poem,

469
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,110
you have to drink three cups as punishment.

470

That's the rule.

You can sit next to me later.

To show fairness,

I've invited Mr. Wen to be the judge.

474
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:32,280
He will not participate in the battle.

475
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:35,290
I'm afraid it's unfair.

Why are you here?

477
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,680
I came to seek justice for you.

Your Highness, what do you mean?

479
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:47,530
The wine cup floats from upstream to downstream.

480
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,830
If it floats here,

481
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,040
it will definitely spin.

482
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:51,150
Then the probability of staying

483
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:52,680
will be greatly increased.

484
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,880
It's not fair for Cheng Manyi.

00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:35,060
Please compose a poem.

513
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,480
Look carefully.

514
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:48,970
Sparse stars, faint moonlight in the empty courtyard.

515
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:52,230
Sorrow and resentment, like clouds and rain, are reflected on a lotus face.

516
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:55,540
After a night of wind and rain, flower petals are scattered about.

517
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:58,800
The red fragments drift and wither, covering everything.

518
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:01,380
This poem really moves me.

519
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:04,350
It's not good at all.

520
00:28:04,670 --> 00:28:05,370
It’s not good.

521
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:07,430
The Fifth Prince doesn't know poems.

522
00:28:08,670 --> 00:28:10,430
Mr. Wen, please evaluate.

523
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,950
I smell tea.

524
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,900
Why do you like someone else's husband so much?

525
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:18,900
The entire poem carries a sense of resentment.

526
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:20,510
If it's limited to

527
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:23,010
personal romantic matters between men and women,

528
00:28:23,010 --> 00:28:25,410
it feels rather lowbrow.

529
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:26,390
I...

530
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:28,940
Mr. Wen is right.

531
00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:32,360
Surely, the World's Greatest Talented Woman, Cheng Manyi,

532
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:34,010
must have a broad mind.

533
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:36,620
Please look forward to it.

534
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,270
You are setting me up again.

535
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,770
Okay, continue.

536
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:01,640
Du Yaqin.

537
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,920
Compose another poem.

538
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:09,550
Water splashes, and rolling waves shimmer.

539
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:12,190
Wooden strings hum with a soothing tone.

540
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:14,690
Rain softly moistens the cloud-fringed hair.

541
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:17,080
Flowers bloom within the lotus heart.

542
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:19,140
Good.

543
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:20,220
Go on.

544
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,040
Du Yaqin.

545
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,580
A thousand miles chasing the wind-blown bird, bright and clear.

546
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:32,000
Waving butterflies, as fleeting as an inch.

547
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,280
Falling flowers and flowing water reflect unfulfilled love.

548
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,540
Why don't mandarin ducks pair up.

549
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:37,990
The cup is full.

550
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,160
Stop.

551
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:00,120
I hereby announce that

552
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,130
the Poetry Competition

553
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,390
is over.

554
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:15,410
Mr. Wen, good idea.

555
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,240
You're indeed the king of ideas.

556
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:18,980
Manyi.

557
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,670
As expected of me.

558
00:30:22,670 --> 00:30:23,670
Winning effortlessly from start to finish

559
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:25,000
without any challenge.

560
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,250
An ordinary chosen one.

561
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:29,140
Manyi.

562
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:31,520
Do you really think you're lucky?

563
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,830
Am I wrong?

564
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:36,560
Manyi told me that

565
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,860
you already know her fake identity as a talented woman.

566
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:39,670
Yes.

567
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:41,040
I'm here for this.

568
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:43,520
I'm afraid the Vice Censor-in-Chief Du is secretly scheming,

569
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:47,120
so it's likely that Manyi's secret will be exposed to the public.

570
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:48,340
I have an idea.

571
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,110
What is it?

572
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:50,170
Mr. Wen, please go ahead.

573
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:51,060
Do you know that

574
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:54,550
magnets can both attract

575
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,060
and repel?

576
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:57,960
I see.

577
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:00,200
Place a magnet

578
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:02,230
at the bottom of the wine cup

579
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:05,360
and then placed a repelling magnet at Manyi's location.

580
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:06,580
In this way,

581
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,850
Manyi will be safe.

582
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:13,940
You two are smart.

583
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:15,380
Not bad.

584
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,000
His Majesty held the Poetry Competition today,

585
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,920
yet Miss Cheng didn't have a chance to compete.

586
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,410
What a disappointment.

587
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:24,790
Am I right?

588
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,060
Yes.

589
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,300
What?

590
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:29,840
This shameless old man.

591
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,920
Trying one scheme after another.

592
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:33,080
What are you doing?

593
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,400
In my opinion,

594
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:38,060
why don't we compose a poem impromptu?

595
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:39,650
Point at anything

596
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,280
and have Miss Cheng

597
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:44,750
and the other talented people take turns composing poems.

598
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,940
If this gets out,

599
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:48,700
it'll be a grand literary event in  our Feng State.

600
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:49,940
That makes sense.

601
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,820
Come, let’s welcome Miss Cheng.

602
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:53,240
Okay.

603
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,010
Old Crow doesn't have moral ethics.

604
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:56,270
He wants a wheel battle

605
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,980
so it will be me against all of them.

606
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,620
You've disgraced

607
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:01,450
the reputation of the scholars.

608
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:06,270
Miss Cheng is known as the World's Greatest Talented Woman.

609
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:08,200
She doesn't dare to fight.

610
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:10,930
Could it be the title of 'Talented Woman'

611
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,180
is not accurate?

612
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:16,540
Or could it be that Mr. Wen

613
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:18,920
was dishonest back then?
