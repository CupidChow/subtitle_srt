00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,990
[Episode 8]

3
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:15,750
Mr. Wen, did you...

4
00:01:16,039 --> 00:01:18,150
cheat back then?

5
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:20,660
It's fine you were accusing me.

6
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:22,320
Why are you talking about him?

7
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:25,070
Good, you've got my attention.

8
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:26,890
I, Cheng Manyi, accept the challenge.

9
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:27,600
No.

10
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:30,180
Don't fall for his provocation.

11
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:30,470
Yes.

12
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:31,550
Old Crow tried so hard

13
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:33,140
to get me and just wouldn't let go.

14
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,670
Whether I face it or not, it's the same result.

15
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,530
Then,

16
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,070
are you confident?

17
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:38,630
No.

18
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:40,700
Well...

19
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:42,580
Don't worry.

20
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:44,670
If...

21
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,979
I won't implicate you.

22
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,940
Don't worry.

23
00:01:54,550 --> 00:01:56,880
I'm not afraid of being implicated by you.

24
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:06,060
Let me give you a question first.

25
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,630
How about composing a poem using the objects

26
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,139
in this courtyard as inspiration?

27
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:12,540
Miss Cheng, please.

28
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,150
If you still can't do it,

29
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,600
I will be one step ahead.

30
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:21,910
By then,

31
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:25,550
the title of the World's Greatest Talented Woman in the world...

32
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:34,720
Goose.

33
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:39,270
Goose, Goose, Goose…

34
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,230
Goose?

35
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:42,390
Why are you laughing?

36
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:43,600
Is it funny?

37
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:45,520
I say it's a good poem.

38
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,780
Is this a poem?

39
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:51,010
Does it even deserve to be called one?

40
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:52,670
Huh.

41
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:53,620
I almost forgot

42
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,960
the necessary skill in the time travel drama—

43
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,130
copying poems.

44
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,020
Tang poems, Song poems, and Yuan Songs.

45
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,440
I'll mix everything together.

46
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,430
It'll be enough

47
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,590
to stun you ancient people!

48
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,820
I'll destroy you.

49
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:03,890
Miss Cheng,

50
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:07,190
Is your ignorance going to be exposed?

51
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,390
Goose, Goose, Goose,

52
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,930
Sings to the sky with its neck curved.

53
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,110
White feathers float atop green waters.

54
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:23,550
Red feet stir up clear ripples.

55
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,420
That's great.

56
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:27,010
It's a preemptive opening.

57
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:27,590
Wonderful.

58
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:28,710
The verses are meticulously balanced,

59
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:29,950
with an interplay of movement and stillness,

60
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,480
creating endless marvels.

61
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:33,410
This wonderful work

62
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,980
does not seem impromptu.

63
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:38,210
It's more like something you remembered beforehand.

64
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:40,210
Did she memorize it in advance?

65
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,730
Was it plagiarism?

66
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:42,550
Yes.

67
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,310
Enough.

68
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,840
Don't bother.

69
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:46,750
Take turns to give me questions.

70
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:47,980
I'm in a hurry.

71
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,890
I want to fight with ten at the same time!

72
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,930
When life goes well, one must revel.

73
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:08,220
Never show an empty cup to the moon.

74
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:11,420
The bright moon shines over the sea.

75
00:04:11,470 --> 00:04:14,740
From far away, we share this moment.

76
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,470
Don't worry about having no friends.

77
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:22,910
Who does not know you in this world?

78
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:26,030
I want to compare West Lake to a beauty.

79
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:30,190
It's equally beautiful with light or heavy makeup on.

80
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,140
What is love in the world?

81
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:39,940
It makes people pledge their lives to one another.

82
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:42,310
Suddenly, as if a spring breeze came overnight,

83
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:45,070
Thousands of pear trees blossom at the same time.

84
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,070
The water falls down 3,000 feet,

85
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:48,870
Like the Milky Way falls from the sky.

86
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:50,430
The moon shines in front of my bed.

87
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,230
I mistook it for the frost on the ground.

88
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:52,870
Can you see

89
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:54,870
The water of the Yellow River comes from the sky

90
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:57,390
And races to the sea without ever returning?

91
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:58,990
Heaven gave me talent for a reason.

92
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:01,390
Spend now; riches return in season.

93
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,670
I rise and dance; with my shadow, I play.

94
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:03,710
On high as on earth, would it be as gay?

95
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:05,030
I know not in heaven's palaces

96
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:07,030
What year it is this night.

97
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:09,740
Sing to the wine and celebrate, for life is but a fleeting moment.

98
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,470
I long to ride the wind and return;

99
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:13,310
Yet fear that marble towers and jade houses…

100
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:16,910
A thousand times, I've been seeking him among the crowds.

101
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:18,570
And just when I turned around,

102
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,320
There he was,

103
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,620
where the lantern lights

104
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:45,680
were dim.

105
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:49,210
A thousand times, I've been seeking him among the crowds.

106
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,650
And just when I turned around,

107
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:55,240
♫The candle is burning out, the dawn is breaking♫

108
00:05:52,950 --> 00:05:57,110
There he was, where the lantern lights are dim.

109
00:05:55,510 --> 00:05:58,260
♫The moon knows my thoughts♫

110
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:02,490
♫Life is so long, I hope to spend♫

111
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:05,640
♫The rest of my life with you♫

112
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:06,270
Good poem.

113
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,850
♫It's a long way to go♫

114
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:08,750
Such a beautiful love

115
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:10,670
is as sweet as honey.

116
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:19,590
♫May I have a lifelong partner♫

117
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,750
I'm shipping!

118
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:24,520
♫Let me be your lover♫

119
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:23,970
Let go of me!

120
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,400
Cui Jun.

121
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,890
You did it on purpose.

122
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,810
Didn't you ask me to let go?

123
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:33,940
Tell me.

124
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,290
He's so unromantic.

125
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:37,270
How can he let go?

126
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,580
Congratulations, Miss Cheng, for winning the Poetry Meeting.

127
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:46,370
According to tradition, we need you to dedicate a poem

128
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:48,760
and ask Mr. Wen to seal it.

129
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:51,670
I'll keep it and appreciate it from time to time.

130
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:52,930
Hey, old man.

131
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:54,090
Are you done?

132
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,430
What do you mean?

133
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:05,820
Okay. Here, Honey.

134
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,660
Miss Cheng, can't you write?

135
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,660
Why do you need Mr. Wen's help?

136
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,870
I'm always writing with my husband like this

137
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,500
when we're at home.

138
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:23,950
Am I right, Honey?

139
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:26,390
Yes. You're so naughty.

140
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,970
Don't you like my man?

141
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,430
Then, I'll show you how much we're in love

142
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:30,610
to piss you off.

143
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:38,960
Here, Honey.

144
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:53,080
This poem is specially written for Vice Censor-in-Chief Du.

145
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:54,500
Please enjoy it.

146
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:55,700
We're leaving.

147
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,540
Thank you, Miss Cheng.

148
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:58,880
Thank you, Mr. Wen.

149
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:07,250
In matters of culture, I am deficient,

150
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:10,420
and my intellect is meager;

151
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,990
inquire of my essence,

152
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,400
and I am but a grand, unrefined creature.

153
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,490
I am a creature.

154
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:23,450
I am an unrefined creature.

155
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:26,980
I am a grand, unrefined creature.

156
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,210
Good poem.

157
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:32,590
Father.

158
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:37,360
Okay, thank you.

159
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:42,970
Old Crow will go crazy with rage.

160
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:46,820
Your performance just now

161
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,110
really impressed me.

162
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,240
Truly impressive.

163
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:52,660
Of course. Am I good?

164
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:55,950
But I don't understand.

165
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,320
You are a genius.

166
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:00,580
Why can't you read?

167
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:05,240
That's because I...

168
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:12,470
Fine.

169
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,930
I admit I didn't compose those poems.

170
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,070
I just...

171
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,310
What's wrong?

172
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,540
Don't look around.

173
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:26,780
I finally found you.

174
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:27,520
You...

175
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,220
We're being followed.

176
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:34,990
He...

177
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:36,480
Let's go.

178
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:38,470
Let's go.

179
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:39,440
This is...

180
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:40,510
Move!

181
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,350
Go upstairs! Hurry!

182
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:47,020
-This way.
-Go!

183
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:48,450
Catch him!

184
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:48,980
Get him!

185
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,400
This way.

186
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:51,660
-This way.
-This way. Hurry.

187
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,870
Stop!

188
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:56,850
Run! Why don't you run anymore?

189
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,060
Do you trust me?

190
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:16,830
Stop!

191
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:17,550
Run!

192
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:19,790
Go after them!

193
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,550
Excuse me.

194
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,050
Go inside.

195
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,200
Raise the sedan.

196
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:28,670
Over there!

197
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,200
Go!

198
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,030
Go! Go!

199
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,810
Move!

200
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,270
-Move!
-Move!

201
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:35,830
Get lost!

202
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:37,790
Go away!

203
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:38,460
Go away!

204
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,640
Be gentle.

205
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:46,850
Go!

206
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,390
Please spare my life.

207
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:50,300
We have never seen the buyer.

208
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:51,510
We just said

209
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,920
we'd trade in this shabby temple.

210
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,660
Payment upon delivery.

211
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:56,230
Really?

212
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,740
I'm telling the truth.

213
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,600
Manyi.

214
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:01,780
Looks like he's telling the truth.

215
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,280
According to your analysis,

216
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,820
Vice Censor-in-Chief Du stirred up so much trouble today

217
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:14,930
just to get the seal?

218
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:15,850
A serial trap.

219
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,500
It'd be great if he could expose your identity.

220
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:22,140
If that was the case, our entire Wen family would be executed,

221
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,850
and we'd have to hand over the seal.

222
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:24,640
If not,

223
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,750
he also has a last move,

224
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,610
which is to grab the seal by force.

225
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:30,070
Old Crow is so cunning.

226
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,270
Manyi,

227
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:34,200
why are we dressed like this?

228
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:37,690
Vice Censor-in-Chief Du is just a pawn.

229
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,240
Guess

230
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,540
what he would do after he got the seal.

231
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,730
He'll surely ask the mastermind for credit.

232
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:46,940
I see.

233
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:51,190
You mean we should be dressed as killers

234
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:52,740
to follow Vice Censor-in-Chief Du

235
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,870
and find out the mastermind behind it.

236
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,750
You're smart, Honey.

237
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,950
The person behind it must be a big shot.

238
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,750
Besides, it was such a big event today.

239
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:08,210
I think

240
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,990
they were watching our every move

241
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:11,500
behind the scenes.

242
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:18,770
I think I saw the Crown Prince at the Poetry Meeting today.

243
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:30,240
Looks like we're going to catch a big fish.

244
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:16,590
Who are you?

245
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:19,300
Watch out!

246
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:27,030
Come with us to testify against Vice Censor-in-Chief Du.

247
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:35,690
It's a death guard.

248
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:37,630
A death guard?

249
00:13:38,310 --> 00:13:41,840
We have to report it to the City Guard Department to deal with it.

250
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:43,780
Darn it!

251
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:46,030
How did Old Crow escape?

252
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,500
Luckily, you

253
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,180
saw through Wen Chenyi's trap today

254
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:58,830
and informed me to leave in advance.

255
00:13:58,830 --> 00:14:00,770
Otherwise, it's not a big deal for me to be arrested.

256
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:02,520
But it will also get you into trouble.

257
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:05,720
Then, I wouldn't be able to absolve myself from the blame.

258
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,570
Please rest assured, My Lord.

259
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:13,860
I will find another way

260
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:14,900
to

261
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:17,870
bring the seal back!

262
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:23,950
[A Talented Girl Grows Up]

263
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,910
I thought the clue was lost

264
00:14:25,910 --> 00:14:27,710
and it was all for nothing today.

265
00:14:28,030 --> 00:14:29,270
I didn't expect

266
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,980
you to be so meticulous.

267
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:33,810
You can even get a clue

268
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,700
from the fabric of his underwear.

269
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,890
Aren't you afraid?

270
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:41,790
What a joke.

271
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,990
I don't know what fear is.

272
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,820
The cloth came from the Eastern Palace.

273
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:50,690
The person behind it might be the Crown Prince.

274
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,610
If we go against the Crown Prince,

275
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,900
our future is bound to be

276
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,010
treacherous.

277
00:14:58,570 --> 00:14:59,630
Aren't you afraid?

278
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:02,390
I said I'd protect you.

279
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:06,330
I'm a heroin of my word.

280
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,860
Let's lure the enemy into a trap

281
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:14,130
and catch them in the trap.

282
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,600
Okay.

283
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,490
Anyway, I did a good job today.

284
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:28,710
Are we going to celebrate by drinking again?

285
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:42,750
Big. Big.

286
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:43,590
Small. Small.

287
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:44,390
Big.

288
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,780
You lost again.

289
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:50,620
This time, I'll choose

290
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:52,890
Truth.

291
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:58,890
Are you going to ask me again

292
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:02,990
how those poems were composed?

293
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:04,540
As the ancient saying goes,

294
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,350
"Poetry expresses one's aspirations; songs convey one’s emotions."

295
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:10,260
The poems you composed today

296
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:11,690
go from being out-of-this-world

297
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:13,020
to very down-to-earth,

298
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,470
ranging from grand and dramatic

299
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:16,100
to deeply concerned about the nation and its people.

300
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,240
It doesn't seem to be done by one person.

301
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,280
Wen Chenyi, you're indeed insightful.

302
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:25,510
You knew it long ago.

303
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:26,450
Right?

304
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,600
I'm never the one you admire anyway.

305
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:32,560
Nonsense.

306
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:34,910
What I admire

307
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,100
is your frankness,

308
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:38,510
your righteousness,

309
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:39,750
your wisdom,

310
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:40,760
and you.

311
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,150
I hereby

312
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:50,900
abolish Truth.

313
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:53,390
We'll only play Dare from now on.

314
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,270
If you lose,

315
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:58,680
take off a piece of your clothes

316
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:01,660
or shout three times in the yard

317
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,920
"I'm a beast!"

318
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:05,910
Do you dare?

319
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:10,680
Are you scared?

320
00:17:11,810 --> 00:17:13,349
Admit defeat, Mr. Wen.

321
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:13,950
No.

322
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,300
We'll do as you say.

323
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,150
Why is it different from what I thought?

324
00:17:21,190 --> 00:17:25,290
Shouldn't you say it's inappropriate?

325
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:28,160
Are you scared?

326
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:31,240
I've never been afraid.

327
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,010
Fine. Bring it on.

328
00:17:34,290 --> 00:17:35,980
I won't be the loser anyway.

329
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:37,110
Come on.

330
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,630
One game determines the winner.

331
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:49,590
Big. Big.

332
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:50,190
Small.

333
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:51,070
Big.

334
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:51,470
Small.

335
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:51,990
Big.

336
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:52,390
Small.

337
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:53,070
-Big.
-Small.

338
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:53,950
-Big.
-Small.

339
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:54,350
Small.

340
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:55,270
Big!

341
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:02,100
Come on, baby.

342
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,110
Come on.

343
00:18:04,130 --> 00:18:08,260
Come on.

344
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:33,780
I'm a beast.

345
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:35,880
What did you say?

346
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,890
I can't hear you. Louder.

347
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:42,910
Will you shout?

348
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:45,050
If you don't,

349
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:48,510
I'll take off your clothes.

350
00:18:49,130 --> 00:18:50,420
I'm a beast.

351
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:08,070
I'm sorry to implicate you again.

352
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:12,790
I'm used to it.

353
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:16,900
Is Father really going to make us kneel all night?

354
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:18,670
How about

355
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,740
pretending to be sick?

356
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,430
My parents have gone to rest.

357
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,410
You can take a little break.

358
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,060
Okay.

359
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:24,910
You're awake.

360
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:28,450
You knelt all night?

361
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:30,950
I dare not disregard

362
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,360
my father's teachings.

363
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:34,870
You didn't move at all?

364
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:38,010
You were having a good dream.

365
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,120
I didn't want to disturb you.

366
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,450
Get up.

367
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,050
Your legs are numb?

368
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:54,190
I'm fine.

369
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:55,190
Go back first.

370
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,280
I'll be back soon.

371
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:01,030
Come here.

372
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:05,150
Get on my back. Let me carry you.

373
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:06,360
You carry me?

374
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:08,580
Are you coming up or not?

375
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,780
I'll carry you with my arms if you don't.

376
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:12,160
Fine.

377
00:21:36,510 --> 00:21:37,510
Take it.

378
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:39,830
Hello, sir.

379
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:40,580
Hello, sir.

380
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,150
I didn't expect

381
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,930
scholars in Feng State to like football, too.

382
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:48,870
You mean soccer?

383
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,160
Soccer?

384
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,830
Although soccer is popular among the people,

385
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:56,390
the scholars of the Feng State think highly of themselves.

386
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:58,390
They consider soccer beneath them.

387
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,280
So, even if they like it,

388
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,080
they'll only play it in private.

389
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:03,150
Boring.

390
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:05,500
Even sports are ranked and judged.

391
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:08,790
It’s time to rectify the Sports circle in the Feng State.

392
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:12,590
What ideas do you have, Heroin Cheng?

393
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:15,510
In my hometown…

394
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:18,050
Aren't you from the capital?

395
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,990
Don't care about these details.

396
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,070
In my hometown,

397
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:25,230
there is an unparalleled gala

398
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:26,830
which everyone can enjoy.

399
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:28,700
Show your style on the field,

400
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,930
and display your level in the match.

401
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:32,130
It soars with passion and fuels dreams.

402
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:35,250
Its boundless excitement starts from the feet.

403
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:37,930
It's where hormones and tears fly together,

404
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:41,730
and beer and grilled skewers match perfectly. It's a football game!

405
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,690
Go to the academy first.

406
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,760
I'll be there soon.

407
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:50,420
I want…

408
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:53,660
I know it all.

409
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,710
How dare a martial artist

410
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:02,460
come to the World's Greatest Academy?

411
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,270
That's right.

412
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:04,330
What are you doing?

413
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,560
You can't bully him.

414
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:07,790
Miss Wen, you're a famous lady.

415
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,370
I advise you

416
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,040
not to associate with this martial artist.

417
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:11,470
You...

418
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:12,640
Cheng Manyi.

419
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,300
Manyi.

420
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:14,050
Manyi.

421
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,280
What's going on?

422
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,390
Cui Jun came to the academy to enroll just now.

423
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:18,850
But they said he was just a martial artist,

424
00:23:18,850 --> 00:23:20,500
not worthy of high regard.

425
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,070
They opposed his enrollment

426
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:23,000
and bullied him.

427
00:23:23,910 --> 00:23:24,990
How dare you?

428
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,480
You even bully an incoming student?

429
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:29,240
Miss Cheng, you are wrong.

430
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:30,610
We didn't bully him.

431
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:32,600
We just want to protect

432
00:23:32,630 --> 00:23:35,330
the century-old reputation of the World's Greatest Academy.

433
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,520
If you let a martial artist enter without permission,

434
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,390
where is the threshold of the academy?

435
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:40,850
How can highbrow elegance

436
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,580
be associated with vulgarity?

437
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,510
That makes sense.

438
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:45,300
Such an illegitimate guy can't be our peer.

439
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,270
Leave the academy! Leave the academy!

440
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:47,670
You...

441
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:49,350
Leave the academy! Leave the academy!

442
00:23:49,350 --> 00:23:51,830
Leave the academy! Leave the academy!

443
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:52,870
Come on, let's fight!

444
00:23:52,870 --> 00:23:53,270
Come on.

445
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:53,870
Manyi.

446
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:54,970
Why does she even want to fight?

447
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:55,350
Exactly.

448
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,230
Forget it.

449
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,310
I'm a martial artist.

450
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,090
My father is just a military officer.

451
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,600
I was not worthy of it.

452
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,140
I won't trouble you.

453
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,380
Cui Jun.

454
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:12,950
Come back with dignity.

455
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:18,200
Martial artists are not the reason for you to be self-abased.

456
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,260
"Heaven gave me talent for a reason."

457
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:23,230
Everyone has their own value.

458
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,190
As for you,

459
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:29,530
you look so pathetic when you show off superiority.

460
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:32,060
Coming from a family of scholarly tradition?

461
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,540
Ladies from noble families?

462
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:38,510
I'm afraid you can't even compare

463
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,790
to me, a martial artist's daughter.

464
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:40,610
What did you say?

465
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:42,540
Heaven gave me talent for a reason.

466
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:44,420
Manyi.

467
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:45,960
I see.

468
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:52,270
The essence of education is to nurture people.

469
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:53,820
It should be people-centered

470
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:55,420
and treat everyone equally.

471
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:57,910
If recruiting martial artists

472
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:00,390
damages its century-old reputation,

473
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:01,380
then it

474
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,800
doesn't deserve to be called the World's Greatest Academy.

475
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,590
You're right, Honey.

476
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:07,640
Brother.

477
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:08,510
Mr. Wen.

478
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:10,500
Greetings, Mr. Wen.

479
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,950
The World's Greatest Academy

480
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:14,530
embodies the cultivation of virtue and the nurturing of people.

481
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:17,590
It should provide education without discrimination.

482
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:19,920
I recommend that Cui Jun enrolls

483
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:24,010
so that scholars and martial artists

484
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:25,900
can receive equal education.

485
00:25:26,630 --> 00:25:29,620
I hope you can abandon prejudice

486
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:31,330
and treat everyone equally.

487
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:39,280
These are all your favorite food.

488
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,290
So, you're conducting an educational pilot program.

489
00:25:43,290 --> 00:25:44,120
Amazing.

490
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:45,100
Mr. Wen.

491
00:25:45,470 --> 00:25:47,220
Cui Jun secretly brought

492
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:49,070
a vulgar thing, a soccer.

493
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,820
It's a disgrace to the academy.

494
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,770
If this goes on, it'll be a bad influence.

495
00:25:52,770 --> 00:25:55,370
I'm afraid it might affect my classmates.

496
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,400
Exactly.

497
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:57,640
Speaking of which,

498
00:25:58,070 --> 00:26:00,830
I have something to announce.

499
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:02,800
I've decided

500
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:04,720
to propose that the academy

501
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,690
hold its first soccer tournament.

502
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:09,710
All of you must participate. No one may decline.

503
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:11,150
Great!

504
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,210
Soccer…

505
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:13,350
Great!

506
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,180
I just recommended the game to you,

507
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,360
and you made it public immediately.

508
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,560
Your ability to execute is impressive.

509
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,090
First, what you said before,

510
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,030
"the comprehensive development"

511
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:29,970
does make sense.

512
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,000
Good day, Mr. Wen.

513
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,640
So, I'm planning to take this opportunity

514
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,510
to incorporate physical fitness courses into the academy

515
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:39,370
to achieve a true integration of literary and martial arts.

516
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:42,800
Second, do you remember

517
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:44,290
our plan of luring them in?

518
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:46,390
You mean...

519
00:26:47,290 --> 00:26:48,980
a new event

520
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,390
like a soccer game

521
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,870
will definitely attract all the famous people

522
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:54,040
to join the fun.

523
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:56,470
For example…

524
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,810
the Eastern Palace?

525
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:59,480
The one who knows me well

526
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,140
is Heroin Cheng.

527
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,740
We can take this opportunity

528
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:06,640
to put up a show.

529
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:09,710
Everyone.

530
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:10,560
Everyone!

531
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:11,620
Everyone.

532
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:15,570
The Crown Prince thinks the soccer competition is very novel.

533
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:16,560
He's interested

534
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,640
and would like to be guest of honor for the opening kick

535
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:27,080
Everyone, the soccer match is coming.

536
00:27:27,470 --> 00:27:29,930
We need two teams to compete with each other.

537
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,680
What do you think, Du Yaqin?

538
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,200
Do you dare to compete with me again?

539
00:27:34,390 --> 00:27:37,060
I don't like soccer.

540
00:27:38,310 --> 00:27:40,170
It's expected that you're afraid of me.

541
00:27:40,170 --> 00:27:41,030
Forget it.

542
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:43,530
You've never beaten me anyway.

543
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,480
I feel a bit tired of

544
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,530
beating you all the time.

545
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:51,390
Cheng Manyi, don't be too arrogant.

546
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,510
I'll take the challenge.

547
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:53,700
I'm not afraid of you.

548
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:54,850
Fine.

549
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,220
Good.

550
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:02,160
If you lose,

551
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,470
take your people

552
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,810
and sincerely apologize to Cui Jun.

553
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:08,000
And don't bully him again.

554
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:08,730
Yes.

555
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:10,080
Agreed.

556
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:11,900
If you lose,

557
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:14,430
ask Cui Jun to leave the academy.

558
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,390
No.

559
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:18,370
How can you bet on others' future?

560
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:19,150
Yes.

561
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:21,040
Yes, I can't betray my teammates.

562
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,910
I'll bet with you.

563
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:28,430
If I lose, I will leave the academy.

564
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:29,940
No.

565
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:31,800
That's better.

Since you are all new players,

569
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:45,450
this tournament will adopt new rules.

570
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:47,940
You can play soccer on the ground.

571
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,630
To reduce the difficulty,

572
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:52,520
there will be five people on each team

573
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,250
plus two substitutes.

574
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:55,990
Each team has seven members.

Cheng Manyi and Du Yaqin are the team leaders.

Mr. Wen.

588
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:20,650
No, you can't choose him.

00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:22,070
Why not?

590
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:24,930
It's never said that Mr. Wen is not allowed to participate.

591
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:27,610
Besides, Mr. Wen said himself

592
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:29,560
that everyone has to participate.

593
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:32,050

As a teacher,

597
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:45,120
I should set an example.

598
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,900
I'm willing to join the team.

You.

Oh no, Manyi.

603
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,290
We're short of one person.

604
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:02,620
We need one more.

Sure. We practiced day and night.

We'll be able to score in no time.

Guys,

615

Tell me the truth.

I know nothing.

618
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,010
I know a little?

619
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:38,530
Let me calm down first.

620
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,120
My head is buzzing.

621
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,750
Fortunately, I've watched countless dramas.

622
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:45,010
I've watched that episode about soccer.

623
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,050
Soccer is a team-based, competitive sport

624
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,750
that requires everyone to play their part,

625
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:54,010
with players coordinating through passing, ball control, shooting, and defensive strategies.

626
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:56,010
There are five players on the field.

627
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,490
One will be the goalkeeper.

628
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,270
Two will be the forwards,

629
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:03,000
and two will be the backs.

630
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:04,560
Well...

631
00:31:04,570 --> 00:31:08,180
Manyi, what is a goalkeeper?

632
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:10,240
What do you mean by forwards and backs?

633
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,310
To put it simply,

634
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:14,070
forwards are in charge of attacking,

635
00:31:14,070 --> 00:31:15,190
breaking through defenses, and taking shots,

636
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:16,410
while defenders focus on marking opponents

637
00:31:16,410 --> 00:31:17,710
and covering positions.

638
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:19,930
We need to be flexible on the field

639
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,910
and change the formation at any time.

640
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:23,880
If the opponents are aggressive,

641
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,880
the 2-2 formation I just talked about

642
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:27,590
needs to be changed into

643
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:30,420
3-1 formation for defending and counterattacks.

644
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,440
Do you understand?

645
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:35,590
No.

646
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,630
I can't teach them.

647
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,880
It's just not working at all.

648
00:31:45,550 --> 00:31:47,980
That fake is finally going to be kicked out of the academy.

649
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:50,460
I must drink for three days and nights to celebrate.

650
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,640
I told you long ago

651
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:54,230
not to bet on your future.

652
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,370
You deserve it.

653
00:31:58,630 --> 00:32:00,230
Mr. Wen, there's no obstacle

654
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:02,120
between us anymore.

655
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:03,980
Let's go.

656
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:08,800
No.

657
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:09,980
No.

658
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,020
No!

659
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:14,200
No. No.

660
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:15,650
No.

661
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,530
Manyi.

662
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:18,380
Manyi?

663
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,210
Wen Chenyi, how dare you cheat on me?

664
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:24,110
What?

665
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,190
I'm sorry.

666
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:29,350
I might have a fake brain.

667
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,560
But you should leave.

668
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:33,730
We are in different teams now.

669
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:35,770
We shouldn't talk to each other.

670
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:38,140
But I'm for you.

671
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,580
Then, go to Du Yaqin's team

672
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,320
to be a spy

673
00:32:41,350 --> 00:32:43,240
and get me some information.

674
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:43,710
Wait…

675
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:45,500
Brother.

676
00:32:48,070 --> 00:32:48,860
Brother.

677
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:50,020
Don't worry.

678
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:52,570
I will keep an eye on Manyi for you.

679
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,460
Keep an eye?

680
00:32:54,610 --> 00:32:57,980
After all, there is a royal member

681
00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:00,280
and a childhood friend of hers on our team.

682
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,130
She's surrounded by wolves.

683
00:33:02,150 --> 00:33:04,150
They are all strong rivals of yours.

684
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,750
The marriage of my brother and sister-in-law

685
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:07,630
is in danger.

686
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,160
You can be the back.

687
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,110
You run fast.

688
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,200
Manyi did all this for me.

689
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:14,400
If we lose,

690
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,900
I'll drop out with you.

691
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,820
A gentleman dies for his confidant.

692
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:22,470
I'm willing to stand together

693
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:23,310
with you.

694
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:26,110
Good friends. You're both loyal.

695
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:29,160
We'll face it together if we lose,

696
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,190
and celebrate together if we win.
