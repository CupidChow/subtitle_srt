[Episode 2]

3
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:15,830
I want to go back.

4
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:17,780
His Majesty appointed you to join the verbal struggle.

5
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,630
All the land belongs to His Majesty.

6
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:21,230
You won't be able to escape.

7
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:34,550
You will save me, right?

8
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,100
It's okay

9
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,830
to save you.

10
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:41,840
Really?

11
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,830
As long as I can go back alive,

12
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:47,430
I'll ask the author to add more scenes for you,

13
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:50,350
like giving many beauties and much wealth to you.

14
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,580
You'll be the treasure of the world.

15
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,640
What nonsense are you talking about?

16
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:56,520
That's not important.

17
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:58,170
How are you going to save me?

18
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:59,229
It will pay

19
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,580
my reputation.

20
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,790
Then, it's not appropriate. Forget it.

21
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:06,900
Mr. Wen,

22
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:08,280
you have profound learning

23
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,970
and are kind.

24
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,690
I'm weak, pitiful, lonely, and helpless.

25
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,700
You won't

26
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,030
stand by, right?

27
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:24,410
You take the initiative to

28
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:25,570
ask for my help.

29
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,290
I heard you're looking for an ancient painting, right?

30
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:31,040
Yes. Will you help me look for it?

31
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,590
Yes.

32
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,829
I can kill two birds with one stone.

33
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,740
As long as you come with me to study in the academy,

34
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:41,170
and do whatever I want you to do,

35
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:45,130
I'll sacrifice my reputation to play a loving couple with you.

36
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,110
Then, we can keep your illiteracy a secret

37
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,350
and keep you safe.

38
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,300
At the same time,

39
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,000
I'll try to help you look for the painting.

40
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,470
Good.

41
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,770
As long as I can ride your coattails,

42
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,420
others won't suspect that I'm illiterate.

43
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,260
Then, I'll be safe.

44
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,110
Okay.

45
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,350
I

46
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,030
have written down our words on the agreement.

47
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:10,480
If there is no objection,

48
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,480
we will take it as the written pledge

49
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:15,710
and never betray it.

50
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,790
Wait, you prepared

51
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,270
it beforehand, huh?

52
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,980
He needs my help

53
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,350
but it seemed like I was begging him.

54
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:36,530
What a cunning man!

55
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:40,170
He set a trap for me.

56
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,090
Find the painting for me.

57
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:49,940
[A Talented Girl Grows Up]

58
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:55,630
I have never seen this painting.

59
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:57,380
So strange.

60
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,420
It's

61
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,350
totally different.

62
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,280
But its outline is about like this.

63
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,080
Remember the aspect astrology.

64
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,790
It's a busy road.

65
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,840
It's lovely.

66
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:31,940
My lady.

67
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,290
Young Madam is curious about everything.

68
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:37,110
Would you like a sugar painting?

69
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,270
I...

70
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,659
Mr. Wen is here.

71
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,230
Is this Mrs. Wen,

72
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,700
the World's Greatest Talented Woman?

73
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,060
Sorry. I didn't recognize you, Mrs. Wen.

74
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:51,060
What do you want? I'll give it to you for free.

75
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,400
I want this one.

76
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:54,610
Okay, I'll make it for you right away.

77
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:57,000
Does everyone know him?

78
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,820
Feng State has always been thinking highly of scholars rather than warriors.

79
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:00,800
Young Master is the World's Greatest Scholar.

80
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,460
Everyone respects him.

81
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,640
Mrs. Wen, your sugar painting is ready.

82
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:13,990
Catch the thief!

83
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,470
Stop! Stop!

84
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:17,030
Freeze!

85
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:18,900
Go!

86
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,670
Did you see that man?

87
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,680
Yes.

88
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:28,070
He was caught

89
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:30,320
and will be punished severely

90
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,490
because he was found

91
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,710
to be illiterate.

92
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,390
Don't be afraid.

93
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:41,220
I will protect you.

94
00:05:44,659 --> 00:05:47,250
Go away. Warriors are not welcome.

95
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:48,970
Go away!

96
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,390
What are you doing?

97
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:50,790
Go away.

98
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:52,430
Please come in, gentlemen.

99
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,230
What did they drive them away?

100
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,690
Do they think warriors are not respectable?

101
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:59,180
That's because

102
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:01,830
some scholars have booked the whole place.

103
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:05,780
Why are people divided into different classes?

104
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,960
Why a talented person is superior?

105
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:09,870
Isn't his life

106
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,600
supported by ordinary people?

107
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:15,720
Besides, we need warriors to protect our country.

108
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,950
If there is an attack from outside,

109
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:19,210
can we defeat enemies by reciting poems?

110
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:23,240
Everyone is born equal, and there must be a use for their talent.

111
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,350
That makes sense.

112
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:36,500
It's going to rain.

113
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:37,710
Jiaobai.

114
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,060
Yes.

115
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:38,990
Come with me to buy umbrellas.

116
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:39,560
Okay.

117
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,710
My lady, let's go.

118
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,690
Miss, take a look.

119
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,630
Sir, do you have

120
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,670
rare

121
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:53,190
and precious ancient paintings?

122
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:56,070
Are you one of those who are looking for the treasure of Feng State?

123
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:58,070
Give up as soon as possible.

124
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:00,530
The saying that whoever gets the treasure will rule the world

125
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:02,010
is just a rumor.

126
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,440
What treasure?

127
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,420
I just want to buy ancient paintings.

128
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:09,510
Paintings?

129
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:11,310
I have all kinds of paintings.

130
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:12,870
Pick whatever you want.

131
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:15,310
Du Yaqin is elegant

132
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,830
and attractive.

133
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:20,150

Du Yaqin is elegant

140
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:36,659
and attractive.

141
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:39,490
It turns out that there's an ancient fan culture.

142
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:41,690
She is a celebrity of the ancient times.

143
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:44,630
Who is Du Yaqin?

144
00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:46,760
She is the daughter of Vice Censor-in-Chief Du.

145
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,590
She is

146
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:48,840
from a noble family.

147
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,110
She is charming

148
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:51,290
and talented.

149
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,750
She's named as the World's Second Talented Woman.

150
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,550
The second.

151
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:56,590
The World's Second Talented Woman?

152
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:59,810
I read it in the comic prologue.

153
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:04,930
She was defeated by Cheng Manyi.

154
00:08:09,970 --> 00:08:12,460
Du Yaqin is elegant

155
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:14,980
and attractive.

156
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:17,350

and attractive.

165
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:34,270
Didn't Wen go with you?

166
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:35,830
He...

167
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:37,090
He has something to do.

168
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,960
I used to call him Wen.

169
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:42,130
I blurted it out just now.

170
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:43,530
Do you mind it?

171
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,750
No.

172
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:47,620
Great.

173
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,950
After, we had a relationship

174
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:53,630
but we were fated to be apart.

175
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:56,840
Sorry, I said something wrong again.

Don't get me wrong.

How dare you treat Fairy Yaqin so rude?

183
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:18,600
You...

184
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,620
You must have had the evil intention out of jealousy.

185

We'll seek justice for Fairy Yaqin.

What does this have to do with My Lady?

187
00:09:24,570 --> 00:09:25,580
It was Du Yaqin who provoked

She is so insidious

195

Why will I blame her?

Wen Chenyi, are you pretending?

00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:26,490
listen to this song.

You put your hand on my chest.

Sister, look.

361
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:27,190
Did I have a seizure last night?

362
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,870
Yi, don't be afraid.

363
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:36,100
I am here.

364
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,080
If she talks about this,

365
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,370
I will be embarrassed.

366
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:46,480
What are you doing?

367
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:48,900
What's wrong?

368
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:51,390
Are you getting worse?

Let me check on you.

I'm not sick.

371

Don't talk nonsense.

372
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,940
Don't be late

373

for school tomorrow.

You're Wen Chenyi now.

375
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,520
I took care of him all night.

376
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:14,560
But he didn't even say "thank you."

377
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,750
He's ungrateful.

378
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,740
Young Master, you've recovered.

379
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:31,410
Young Madam is indeed virtuous.

380

Master and Madam picked the right girl.

381
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,250
Have you read all the ancient books I gave you?

382
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,130
Have you memorized

383

all the poems?

384
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,470
I think

385
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,470
it's time to check your studies.

386

Young Master.

Where is he? I will beat him.

today is the first day of the academy.

Oh no.

00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,290
I forgot about this.

Oh no.

Wen Chenyi will kill me.

wait for me. I'll go with you.

No need.

But I heard that

445
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:31,530
Mr. Wen married

446
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:34,250
an intelligent, virtuous, and talented woman.

What you did just now

448
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,860
is totally different from a talented woman.

449
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,470

And then?

452
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,790
If Mr. Wen finds out that

453
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:51,130
you reject to let me off, and I'm late because of you,

I'll let you fail the exam at the end of the year.

But if you insist on going alone,

462

then go ahead.

That's right, guys.

are too intimate.

Cheng Manyi is married to Mr. Wen.

00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:43,730
If you keep spreading gossip, it will damage their reputation.

521
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:44,220
You...

522
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,360
What a tragedy!

523
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,620
This couple is not harmonious.

524
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:50,420
What a sin!

525
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,350
Forget it. I'll help you

526
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,690
in case you want to break the contract.

527
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,820
I'm going all out.

528
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:01,110
Honey,

529
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,230
did you forget that

530
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,360
last night,

531
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:10,790
we talked about the philosophy of life, poetry, and so on.

532
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,050
You promised that

533
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:16,530
you would never go apart from me

534
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:18,510
till the doomsday.

535
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:20,600
Why didn't you wake me up in the morning?

536
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,770
I almost got late.

537
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:29,720
You were tired last night.

538
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:31,650
I wanted you to sleep more.

539
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,080
But why were you in the same carriage with the Fifth Prince?

540
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,070
Fifth Prince? Who?

541
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,540
He is the Fifth Prince, Feng Qiwu.

542
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:46,240
What's wrong with having a ride with a classmate?

543
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,040
Du Yaqin,

544
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,090
why did you have such a

545
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:50,900
dirty thought?

546
00:27:50,930 --> 00:27:52,280
What?

547
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,380
What are you talking about?

548
00:27:54,470 --> 00:27:55,940
You just got off the carriage

549
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,870
but you pretended not to know Feng Qiwu.

550
00:27:57,870 --> 00:27:59,720
Is your love for Mr. Wen

551
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:01,310
true?

552
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,410
None of your business.

553
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,630
Mr. Wen,

554
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:07,760
you've only known each other for a few days.

555
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,190
I'm just worried that you were cheated.

556
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,740
A few days?

557
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:17,000
Actually, we've been in love for a long time.

558
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:22,370
I still remember that years ago,

559
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,290
when we met by the Dafeng Lake,

560
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:28,900
he fell in love with me at first sight.

561
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:33,760
Then, he pursued me for months

562
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,790
before I agreed to be with him.

563
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:39,650
But there was a "green tea",

564
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:43,060
who

565
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:46,020
showed up to ruin our relationship.

566
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:48,130
How could "green tea" harm people?

567
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,230
It

568
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:52,640
describes someone

569
00:28:52,810 --> 00:28:55,940
that looks fresh, like green tea

570
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,280
but actually,

571
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:58,620
she's a bitch.

572
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,170
Anyway,

573
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:03,660
I was so smart

574
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:06,400
that I revealed her evil mind

575
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:08,630
hidden under her innocent appearance.

576
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:10,360
Then,

577
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,680
we got married.

578
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:13,230
The end.

579
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:18,940
You're indeed extraordinary.

580
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:21,430
Your sentences are novel.

581
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:25,090
What a romantic story.

582
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,930
I think

583
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,910
you just made

584
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:29,440
this ridiculous story up.

585
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,660
My brother and Manyi are deeply in love.

586
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,510
They are a good match.

587
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:34,510
Stop slandering them.

588
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:35,790
Chenwei,

589
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,850
I'm just worried about the Wen family.

590
00:29:37,850 --> 00:29:40,080
Why are you so aggressive?

591
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:42,150
Thank you for

592
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,620
alienating my brother and sister-in-law.

593
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,160
I...

594
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,500
I didn't.

595
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,140
Yaqin is kind-hearted.

596
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:49,930
After all, we are classmates.

597
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:50,780
Enough.

598
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:52,130
I guess I have to use my ultimate skill.

599
00:29:52,130 --> 00:29:53,810
Or I can't end it.

600
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,570
I can make up stories.

601
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,160
But can I make this up?
