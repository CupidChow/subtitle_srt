in solving cases.

00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:17,910
How about

00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:20,120
pardoning her crime of deceiving the emperor

7
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,920
and allowing her to redeem herself through merit?

8
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,390
Ministers,

9
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,370
the situation is urgent and unexpected.

10
00:01:32,150 --> 00:01:34,430
I will make an exception

11
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:38,190
and allow Cheng Manyi to redeem herself through service.

12
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:40,990
She is granted authority to act with discretion

13
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:43,170

How should we deal with him?

18
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,600
Wen Chenyi deceived the emperor

19
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:58,460
to preserve the dignity of Feng,

20
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,170
which is understandable.

21
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,950
He also made a contribution by winning the literary fight this time.

22
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,390
As you all know,

23
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:07,050
I have always cherished talent.

24
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:09,729
Today, I will pardon his death sentence,

25
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,430

The World's Greatest Academy shall be sealed.

After he assists Grand Master Ning

00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:23,510
in investigating the case of the treasonous document,

33
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,840
we will decide on his further punishment.

34
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,990
Here.

35
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:00,070
Mr. Wen,

36
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,630
why didn't you explain things to her clearly?

37
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,540
You divorced her publicly

38
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,520
because you feared that Grand Master Ning had other backup schemes.

39
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,220
So you wanted to draw a clear line between you and her.

40
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,120
You weren't abandoning her

41
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,620
to protect the Wen family.

42
00:03:11,830 --> 00:03:13,760
Do you think she doesn't know that?

43
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,720
Of course, I figured it out.

44
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,930
Wasn't he just trying to protect me?

45
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,190
Manyi,

46
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,160
are you really not going back?

47
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,380
Of course not.

48
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,800
Grand Master Ning keeps targeting me

49
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,550
because he knows I'm Wen Chenyi's weakness.

50
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,820
That's why I have to go to Jiangnan to solve the big case

51
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,420
and make some achievements.

52
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:41,200
Only then will I have the justification to take the Imperial Martial Arts Examination

53
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,930
and become a City Guard Censor.

54
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,450
I need to become stronger

55
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:47,670
so that I won't always be the leverage Grand Master Ning uses

Right now, I just want to

170
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,470
focus on my career

171
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:17,630
and shine on my own.

172
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,640
Well, that's great.

173
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,880
So, does that mean I have a chance now?

174
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:24,230
A chance for what?

175
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:27,010
Stop thinking about having fun.

176
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,070
We finally finished investigating

177
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:30,210
the cases in Jiangzhou and Lianzhou.

178
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,100
We still need to go to Fuzhou to investigate the bandits.

179
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:32,870
Yes, yes.

180
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:33,720
Of course.

181
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,070
Wen Chenyi,

182
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:39,390
it was you who pushed Manyi away with your own hands.

183
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:42,049
So don't blame me for taking advantage of the opportunity.

184
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:43,039
This time,

185
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:45,550
I definitely won't give her up.

186
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:51,960
Father,

187
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:53,360
Mother,

00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:54,910
Father-in-law.

189
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,020
Now that Vice Censor-in-Chief Du has fallen and been exiled,

190
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,570
and Grand Master Ning's case is over,

191
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:02,130
he has suffered a major setback.

192
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:04,060
I have no more worries,

193
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:05,950
so I want to go find...

194
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:07,750
Alright, alright, say no more.

195
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:10,020
Everything is ready, so hit the road.

196
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:14,370
Yi.

197
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:18,200
What?

198
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:19,740
Father and Mother have long guessed

199
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:20,930
that once this big matter is settled,

200
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:23,510
you will definitely go to Fuzhou to win back Manyi.

201
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:25,770
They had me prepare the luggage early on.

202
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,610
Winning back Manyi is our family's wish.

203
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:31,300
Manyi has given too much for our Wen family

204
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:33,190
without reason.

205
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:35,750
We are family, so we don't need to mention debts;

206
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,680
we can only show it through action.

207
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:39,590
Yi,

208
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:41,260
if you can't bring Manyi back,

209
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:44,120
don't even think about returning to the Wen family.

210
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,180
My good son-in-law,

211
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,530
let bygones be bygones.

212
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,380
I only have one request:

213
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,620
bring Manyi back

214
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,550
safely.

215
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,160
Young Master,

216
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:56,930
Young Lady must be waiting for you.

217
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:57,770
Young Master,

218
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,000
it all depends on your performance now.

219
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:02,890
Father.

220
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:03,950
Mother.

221
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,290
Father-in-law.

222
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,630
I, Wen Chenyi,

223
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:09,760
swear to make extra efforts to compensate Manyi,

224
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,540
cherishing her as a treasure, protecting her with my life,

225
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,800
and bringing her home.

226
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,270
Alright. Go now.

227
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,080
Let me do it, Young Master.

228
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,050
No, Jiaobai.

229
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:24,440
This time,

230
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,790
I need to go alone

231
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:26,790
in disguise.

232
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:29,000
The family carriage must not be used.

233
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,090
You've never traveled this far alone.

234
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:32,550
With no one to protect you,

235
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,850
how will you fare?

236
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:34,780
Yes.

237
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:37,840
If I go with great fanfare,

238
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:40,130
I'm afraid Grand Master Ning may notice.

239
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,300
Jiaobai,

240
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:44,320
I need you to hold down the fort at home,

241
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,200
creating the illusion that I'm still in the capital.

242
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,130
At the same time,

243
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,130
protect the Wen family.

244
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:50,940
Okay.

245
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:55,270
Take care, Young Master.

Miss Chenwei.

249
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,460
Where's Mr. Wen?

250
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:40,400
My brother has already set off for Fuzhou.

251
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:43,540
I'm a step too late.

252
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:46,010
I was thinking about going with him to find Manyi.

253
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:48,270
Why do you want to find my sister-in-law?

254
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:49,920
Manyi and Feng Qiwu

255
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,790
traveled far to solve a big case.

It's been a few days, and I miss them a lot.

The Three Heroes of Feng

258

are now missing just me.

259
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,500
Should I go take a look?

260
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:02,160
No, you can't go.

261
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,300
Why?

262
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,260
It's true that love doesn't have a sequence,

263
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:10,030
but you need to have some sense of shame.

264
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,830
How can you brazenly intrude?

265
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,360
Do you want to be a malicious third male lead,

266
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,800
who disrupts a happy couple

267
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,050
and is scorned for a thousand years?

I...

269
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,090
I don't.

270
00:12:22,230 --> 00:12:24,030
As long as you have some sense of shame,

271
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,270
there's still hope.

272

My brother has finally embarked

on the long journey to pursue his wife.

274
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:33,560
His love rival, Feng Qiwu, is already difficult enough to deal with.

275

Don't interfere.

Manyi is indeed very outstanding.

278
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,370
I can understand

279
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:45,240
why you covet her.

280
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:47,300
I covet...

281
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:49,090
Manyi?

282

that I like Manyi all this time, would you?

289

It seems like you're not acting.

00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,170
is to help you pursue your wife.

512
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:05,880
Cui Jun.

513
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:07,330
Now,

514
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:09,610
it's time for you to show your eagle eyes.

515
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:11,470
Leave it to me.

516
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,910
Feng Qiwu used a stack of silver notes

517
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:18,660
to buy a piece of brocade

518
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:19,890
and gave it to Manyi.

519
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,720
Aren't they investigating a case?

520
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,380
What do they need brocade for?

521
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:25,730
Oh no!

522
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,670
What happened?

523
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:28,360
Feng Qiwu personally put

524
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,730
the brocade on Manyi.

525
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,480
She is all smiles and beaming with joy.

526
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:33,980
Darn it.

527
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:35,610
This is a monetary strategy.

528
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:37,560
Doesn't he have any other methods?

529
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:40,150
Wait.

530
00:22:40,190 --> 00:22:42,720
It seems they are only asking for clues.

531
00:22:43,830 --> 00:22:45,830
Manyi returned the brocade.

532
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:50,990
I knew that Manyi would not be swayed by money.

533
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:52,740
They left!

534
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:53,290
Let's go.

535
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:56,830
Wait. They...

536
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:58,770
Just say it. I can handle it.

537
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:01,630
Manyi is holding Feng Qiwu's hand affectionately,

538
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,320
and Feng Qiwu is gazing at her with a foolish smile,

539
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,300
as if he had already succeeded in loosening her heart.

540

[Clay Oven Rolls]

541
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,520
Keep investigating.

542
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:10,070
Wait!

543
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:13,540
It turns out Feng Qiwu burned his hand while pouring tea,

544
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,220
and Manyi is just helping him apply medicine.

545
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,000
Despicable!

[Clay Oven Rolls]

547
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:20,020
He actually hurt himself to take advantage of the situation.

What are you selling?

549
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,760
What now?

550
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:34,120
Feng Qiwu pulled Manyi close

551
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:36,000
and leaned in towards her face.

552
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,990
Manyi...

553
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:42,070
even closed her eyes.

554
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,880
There's no need for me to say more, right?

555
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:46,650
My eyes

556
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,100
have truly seen through too much.

557
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:50,980
Mr. Wen,

558
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:53,540
I'm sorry for your loss.

559
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:56,600
Impossible.

560
00:23:56,630 --> 00:23:58,720
Manyi couldn't simply have forgotten her feelings for me.

561
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,590
I don't believe it.

562
00:23:59,590 --> 00:24:01,270
Mr. Wen, calm down.

563
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:02,370
Let me check again.

564
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:06,740
There was a misunderstanding.

565
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:10,310
It turns out he is just trying to wipe the crumbs off her face.

566
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,830
If your eyes are useless,

567
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,520
you might as well donate them.

It's good enough if I can help you a little.

Have you heard of

00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:16,990
a notorious thief in Fuzhou?

598
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:18,430
He appeared here once.

Well...

Of course we've heard of him; he once stayed here.

00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:29,690
Then...

00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,630
I want that room.

Just tell us what you know.

He once kidnapped a girl here.

608

It is truly well-known in our village.

Mr. Wen!

Don't stop me!

622
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,700
They've already entered the same room.

623
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,110
This is a serious matter!

624
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:16,220
You once said

625
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,400
that showing up rashly

626
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,940
might backfire.

627
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,150
Patience is a knife that can hurt others as well as yourself.

628
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:22,030
This knife

629
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:24,250
has already stabbed deep into my heart.

630
00:26:25,530 --> 00:26:27,290
Don't alert them!

631
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:28,770
Let's go next door

632
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,130
to gather information.

633
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:31,530
Even if we catch them in the act,

634
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:32,320
we must

635
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,690
catch them red-handed.

636
00:26:34,810 --> 00:26:36,010
Catch them in the act?

637
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,320
Did you hear anything?

638
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,990
I heard

639
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:54,940
a rustling sound.

640
00:26:54,970 --> 00:26:56,500
Nothing else.

641
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,520
Rustling sound?

642
00:26:58,770 --> 00:27:00,070
What does that mean?

643
00:27:01,310 --> 00:27:04,160
Rustling sound...

644
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,470
They were not

645
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,810
taking off their clothes, were they?

646
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:24,210
According to the waiters' testimony,

647
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:27,350
after the notorious thief's harassment,

648
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,050
this room was sealed.

649
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,940
But strangely,

650
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:34,160
there are no clues at all.

651
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:36,950
It's okay, Manyi.

652
00:27:36,970 --> 00:27:39,120
We have plenty of time to investigate.

653
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:41,880
Why is this inn so dirty?

654
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:43,260
I feel so itchy.

655
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:45,480
Got it.

656
00:27:47,110 --> 00:27:48,030
Feng Qiwu,

657
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,070
do me a favor.

658
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,430
What are you doing?

659
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:55,010
If you keep this up, I'll scream.

660
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:56,370
Go ahead.

661
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,620
It's the middle of the night,

662
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:59,000
even if you scream your throat raw,

663
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,800
no one will come to save you.

664
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:02,830
Just give in to me.

665
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,460
Help! Help!

666
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:18,010
Manyi,

667
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:20,060
just now,

668
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:22,990
you asked me to help you in reenacting

669
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,620
the scene of the harassment.

670
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,870
What was that for?

671
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:28,300
I originally wanted to find clues.

672
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:30,730
But I found

673
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:32,260
that the waiters' testimony

674
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,480
doesn't hold up at all.

675
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:34,840
Yeah.

676
00:28:34,870 --> 00:28:37,110
Just now, we were so loud

677
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:38,810
that the people in the next room could hear us clearly

678
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:40,070
and intervene in time.

679
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:43,140
How did the notorious thief manage to pull it off?

680
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,880
That makes sense.

681
00:28:45,210 --> 00:28:47,280
So, Manyi, what's your conclusion?

682
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:49,110
The so-called harassment

683
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,900
may be completely fabricated.

684
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,860
The waiters might have deliberately given you false information

685
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:56,230
to scam you out of your money.

686
00:28:56,230 --> 00:28:56,550
I...

687
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:58,810
Don't show your money to others anymore.

688
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:00,260
Impossible.

689
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:03,110
That was just small change;

690
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,480
it was nothing significant.

691
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,480
I have gold that I haven't given yet.

692
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,100
Why is there no sound now?

693
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:16,070
What exactly are they doing?

694
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,250
Mr. Wen, don't worry.

695
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,670
There must be a solution.

696
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:22,640
Yes.

697
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,030
A solution.

698
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,190
Yes.

699
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,460
Come on, come on.

700
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:39,770
Oh no. My mind is completely blank right now.

701
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:40,330
I...

702
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,710
I am utterly lost.

703
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,790
Indeed,

704
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:47,360
love makes people lose their wits.

705
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:51,670
Even Mr. Wen is not immune to it.

706
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:00,560
I have a brilliant idea,

707
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:01,550
but I'm not sure whether I should...

708
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:02,310
Share it.

709
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,960
Whether it's a stupid plan or a brilliant one,

710
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,430
I just want to know

711
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,170
what exactly they are doing.
