3
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:21,930
Feng Qiwu.

4
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:35,550
You...

5
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:38,720
You don't want to go back to your husband's home or your parents' home.

6
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,380
Nor can you stay at an inn since you have no money.

7
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:46,190
You'd rather stay on the street

8
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,630
than accept

9
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,030
your good friend's help?

10
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:00,160
Is it delicious?

11
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:01,850
It's still warm.

12
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:04,530
See? I accept it now.

13
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:10,190
By the way,

14
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,540
how did you know I was here?

15
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:14,750
I...

16
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,180
I...

17
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,810
Have you been...

18
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:23,840
It's nothing.

19
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:26,570
As your best friend, seeing you in trouble,

20
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:28,360
of course I wouldn't stand by and do nothing.

21
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:30,220
So, I followed you all the way here

22
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:32,579
in case you encounter any danger.

23
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:35,910
By the way, Manyi.

24
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,579
Father wants to summon me to the palace these days.

25
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,870
He said he wanted me to live with him.

26
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,430
Therefore, my mansion would be unoccupied.

27
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:46,850
You can stay there for now.

28
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:48,210
Well...

29
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,530
No, thanks.

30
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:52,940
I know you would feel uneasy

31
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:54,670
if you stayed there for free.

32
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,730
But you have no money now.

33
00:02:57,579 --> 00:02:59,440
You can pay me

34
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:01,610
with Yuber's dividends, okay?

35
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:06,550
Deal.

36
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:07,150
Okay.

37
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,380
You know what I'm thinking.

38
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,430
You're indeed my good friend.

39
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:10,150
Okay.

40
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,790
You're still taking advantage of me when there's no one else.

41
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:19,200
Yaqin, you can't abandon me

42
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,240
and turn your back on me.

43
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,920
Take off your mask.

44
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:23,410
Don't tarnish my dear Wen.

45
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:33,990
What about the thing I asked?

46
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,079
Did you bring it?

47
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,240
Don't tell anyone about what happened today.

48
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,060
Do you hear me?

49
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:49,760
I don't understand.

50
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,570
Many people admire you.

51
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,680
Why do you only like Mr. Wen?

52
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,560
It's none of your business. Go.

53
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:05,000
Although the brushwork is a little childish,

54
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,860
it captures both form and spirit.

55
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,290
I can see that she is talented.

56
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,620
She definitely has great potential.

57
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:16,940
My daughter has such talent!

58
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,700
This is the first time my father praised me.

59
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,640
Maybe it's my value to bring honor to my father.

60
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:38,290
[Announcement]

61
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,370
I guess I wasn't chosen.

62
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,810
Are you there?

63
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:38,960
Did you see it?

64
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,340
No.

65
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,310
What's wrong?

66
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,540
Why are you crying?

67
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,810
Go back and work harder.

68
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,980
As an illegitimate daughter,

69
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:57,830
my failure this time has brought me great disgrace.

70
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,790
My father

71
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,600
won't allow me to take the exam again.

72
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,240
Here.

73
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:10,290
The World's Greatest Academy

74
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,430
values only talent,

75
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:12,890
not background or status.

76
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:14,800
Although you failed the Imperial Examination,

77
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,040
if you are determined,

78
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:19,430
your wish will come true one day.

79
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:24,530
You can do it.

80
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,980
Keep it up.

81
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:39,100
You appear in my life like a ray of light.

82
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:41,390
And now,

83
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,580
I don't want to bear the darkness of solitude anymore.

84
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:48,640
Even if it means I'm heading for certain failure,

85
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,260
I won't regret it.

86
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:58,400
Oh no.

87
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,790
It's been so long.

88
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:02,750
Manyi must have left.

89
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:10,180
Honey.

90
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:13,940
Manyi, you didn'tâ€¦

91
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:16,950
I thought I would never see you again.

92
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,190
I was lost.

93
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:23,470
It took me a lot of effort to find this place.

94
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,760
Look, my feet are bruised red from being scratched by the gravel.

95
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,280
Come, sit down.

96
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,560
Sorry.

97
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:36,120
All I was thinking was to pick flowers.

98
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:37,890
That's why I came late.

99
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,510
I didn't get to meet you.

100
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,280
This is for you.

101
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,590
It's all your fault.

102
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:49,820
You failed to protect me.

103
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,520
Aren't you going to comfort me?

104
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:59,810
Why are you so delicate today?

105
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:02,210
Don't you always appear like

106
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,350
Heroin Cheng, who is not afraid of pain?

107
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:05,230
I...

108
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,480
I was scared, too.

109
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:13,970
It's dark and spooky here.

110
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,430
Even a man

111
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:19,410
will get a little scared.

112
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,480
It's fine if you don't want to comfort me.

113
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:25,610
I'm leaving then.

114
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,240
Wait.

115
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:26,890
Then...

116
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,190
don't you want to see fireflies?

117
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,400
Fireflies?

118
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,940
It's so late.

119
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:36,250
Why don't we see them another day?

120
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,120
Fine.

121
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:41,280
Let's go home.

122
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:42,140
Come.

123
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,159
It's late.

124
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:51,230
Why don't we find an inn to rest

125
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,230
and go back tomorrow morning?

126
00:07:54,710 --> 00:07:55,420
Well...

127
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:58,010
It's just staying at an inn.

128
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,350
Here, Manyi.

129
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:02,900
Look.

130
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,280
What do you think?

131
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:10,550
Good.

132
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,030
Come in.

133
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:26,790
Greetings, Your Highness.

134
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:28,710
Greetings, Miss Cheng.

135
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:31,030
What is all this for?

136
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,240
These are all your servants.

137
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:35,159
If you need anything,

138
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,429
just tell them.

139
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:37,750
As for food,

140
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:39,669
just tell them what you want to eat.

141
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:41,110
They can cook everything.

142
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:42,240
What do you want to eat?

143
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,150
Tell me.

144
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,490
I cook Shandong cuisine.

145
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,310
I can make yummy roasted goose.

146
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:48,740
No hurry.

147
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:49,790
You may leave.

148
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:55,440
Manyi.

149
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:56,960
I asked the two families

150
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,270
who lived next to this house

151
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,790
to move away

152
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,350
so that you won't be disturbed.

153
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:06,420
I'm just staying here temporarily.

154
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,600
You don't have to make such a big fuss

155
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,200
and ask them to move.

156
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:12,390
It's not a big fuss.

157
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:14,450
As long as you live comfortably here,

158
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,600
I think everything will be worth it.

159
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,560
Aren't you going to the palace?

160
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:27,710
Yes.

161
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,440
I almost forgot.

162
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,190
Manyi, you can stay here.

163
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,550
I'm going to the palace.

164
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:35,340
Eat more.

165
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:39,000
Close the door for me.

166
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,070
Have a good rest.

167
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:54,460
It's late at night.

168
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:58,950
Is Wen Chenyi still fooling around with the mistress?

169
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,320
Guards!

[A Talented Girl Grows Up]

171
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,070
Honey,

172
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:17,870
you like peanut cakes the most.

173
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:18,890
Why haven't you

174
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,330
had a bite today?

175
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:24,660
Maybe because I'm tired today,

176
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:26,200
I have a poor appetite.

177
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,780
It's getting late.

178
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:35,100
Honey,

179
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,670
let's rest.

180
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,340
Honey, are you

181
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,420
still mad at me?

182
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,050
How about this?

183
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:47,690
I'll feed you myself

184
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:50,540
as an apology, okay?

185
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,020
How could Manyi

186
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,590
be allergic to peanut cakes?

187
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:21,850
Could it beâ€¦

188
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:25,820
You are not Cheng Manyi.

189
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:27,460
Who are you?

190
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,740
Who am I?

191
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,550
You'll find out tomorrow.

192
00:11:39,110 --> 00:11:40,350
Where is Manyi now?

193
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:42,960
Wen,

194
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,880
is Cheng Manyi the only one in your heart?

195
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,080
Wen.

196
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:52,540
Don't go.

197
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:53,760
Honey.

198
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:02,420
The four of you take the flowers

199
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:05,150
and spread them around the pavilion.

200
00:12:05,950 --> 00:12:06,760
You...

201
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:08,600
According to this diagram,

202
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:11,750
set up an identical one with candles.

203
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:12,580
-Yes.
-Yes.

204
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:14,060
Young Master,

205
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,550
what are the fireworks for?

206
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,710
To celebrate, of course.

207
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:19,840
This

208
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,970
will definitely move Manyi.

209
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:23,930
A surprise?

210
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,790
Did you catch Wen Chenyi,

211
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:28,430
that heartless man, for me, right?

212
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:29,540
No.

213
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,500
You'll know when you get there.

214
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,150
Let's go.

215
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:35,970
Manyi.

216
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,630
What kind of confession

217
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:40,890
would a girl like?

218
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:44,410
Which girl do you like?

219
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:45,260
No one.

220
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,160
Tell me the truth.

221
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:46,870
No.

222
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:49,060
I'm just asking out of curiosity

223
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:49,910
to accumulate experience

224
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,160
in case of emergency.

225
00:12:52,190 --> 00:12:56,030
The way girls hate most is covering the floor with flowers.

226
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,680
That's just a poor imitation of Mary Sue dramas.

227
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:02,680
9,999 roses.

228
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,610
Not only do you spend a lot of money on them,

229
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:05,920
but you also have to throw them all away afterward.

230
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,580
Do you know how wasteful it is?

231
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,880
Andâ€¦

232
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,000
a heart shape set up with candles.

233
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,620
Oh my god. So vulgar.

234
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:19,860
If you ask the girl to stand in the middle of the candles,

235
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,560
she has to endure the heat of the flames

236
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,290
and the pungent smell of the candles.

237
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:24,790
And she even has to

238
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:27,230
listen to the love confession with a smile.

239
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:29,580
It's ridiculous just to think about it.

240
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:31,360
Actually,

241
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:36,230
the confession that a girl wants the most

242
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,520
does not need the superficial things

243
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:41,660
like flowers, candles, and fireworks,

244
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,540
but

245
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:45,650
sincerity and true love.

246
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:47,550
Even if it's just one sentence

247
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,050
and there's no gift,

248
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,590
it'll be more touching than valuable things.

249
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,300
You're right.

250

Well...

A surprise

254
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:09,180
is something that pops up

255
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,840
when you least expect it.

256
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,740

Why don't you sit down, eat some snacks,

260
00:14:17,060 --> 00:14:18,060
and have some tea?

261
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:18,770
Okay.

262
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,960
Manyi. Try this.

263
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:26,520

Can you say something I can understand?

I just want to confess my love.

No.

I almost forgot

348
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:11,470
a necessary tool for a period drama was

349
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:12,510
a human skin mask.

350
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:17,710
But I didn't expect her to make it so real.

351
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:18,500
Yeah.

352
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,020
I didn't expect it, either.

353
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,630
Actually, I met someone

354
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,920
who looked exactly like you that night.

355
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,130
I almost fell victim to her hallucinogenic incense,

356
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:28,860
which nearly led to a disaster.

357
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:30,550
In the end, I found

358
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,670
it was Du Yaqin in disguise.

359
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:35,750
Du Yaqin is really vicious.

360
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,960
But with your petite frame,

361
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:42,600
how did you manage to escape her clutches?

362
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:46,010
Don't tell me

363
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,120
you have been defiled?

364
00:19:58,430 --> 00:20:00,760
Wen, are you okay?

365
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:11,210
Wen! Wen!

366
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:23,160
So,

367
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:25,510
boys should protect themselves,

368
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,360
especially a handsome

369
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:29,620
and weak boy like you.

370
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:31,840
You're more likely to be harassed.

371
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:36,430
In that case,

372
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,290
I'll reluctantly allow you

373
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,800
to seek protection by my side.

374
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:46,510
Let's go.

375
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,310
Let's go.

376
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,630
Thank you, Honey.

377
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:56,750
Go and find Du Yaqin with me.

378
00:20:57,750 --> 00:20:59,090
Why do you still want to see her?

379
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:00,880
To tell her about the jade pendant.

380
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,140
What if she threatens you with that again?

381
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,050
Besides,

382
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:07,130
our family has always repaid grudges with vengeance

383
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:08,590
and righted every wrong.

384
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:13,330
How's Sangyi's case going?

385
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,850
If the owner comes to usâ€¦

386
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:17,890
Don't worry.

387
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:19,490
I've already looked into it.

388
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:21,340
The owner is the seller's sister.

389
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,350
She died long ago.

390
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,720
Du Yaqin is not the owner of the jade pendant.

391
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:28,210
I knew it.

392
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:31,840
If it was really hers, she would've taken it out long ago.

393
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,980
Don't go because it's a fight between women.

394
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:35,910
Wait for me here.

395
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:37,090
Okay.

396
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:42,430
It's not yours.

397
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,410
Don't attempt to lay your hands on it.

398
00:21:43,410 --> 00:21:44,410
Give it back to me.

399
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,170
Cheng Manyi.

400
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:49,950
I just like Wen.

401
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,110
So what?

402
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:53,630
No one can take it away if it's yours.

403
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:56,550
If it's not, it won't be yours even if you fight for it.

404
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:57,900
If it weren't for you,

405
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,210
Both Wen and the World's Greatest Academy

406
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:02,010
should have belonged to me.

407
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:06,030
I've never seen such a shameless person.

408
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:07,110
You lost to me

409
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:09,110
at the Talented Woman Competition.

410
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:10,030
Besides,

411
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:12,700
he would've liked you long ago.

412
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:14,650
Why wait until I show up?

413
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:16,460
Who knows what dirty tricks you used

414
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,550
to confuse Wen

415
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:20,510
and make him resent me?

416
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,320
You've been using tricks,

417
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,700
not Manyi.

418
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:26,470
We had nothing to do with each other.

419
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,070
It's not like I resent you.

420
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:31,390
I never accepted your love.

421
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:32,810
And I won't in the future.

422
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:35,010
Please don't waste your time.

423
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:38,410
Manyi, I'm back.

424
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,240
-I brought you a lot of delicious food.
-Young Master.

425
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,040
Young Master.

426
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:42,840
Miss Cheng has gone back.

427
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,840
She asked me to tell you

428
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,940
to thank you for taking care of her these days.

429
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:49,910
She had some misunderstanding with Mr. Wen.

430
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,780
Now they've reconciled.

431
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,570
She went back to Wen's Mansion.

432
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,140
She went back?

433
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:17,820
It was my wishful thinking in the first place.

434
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,540
If you return the favor,

435
00:23:21,010 --> 00:23:22,280
I'll be grateful.

436
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,700
But if you don't care,

437
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,820
I won't be discouraged.

438
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:38,500
After all this trouble,

439
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:40,870
we didn't see the fireflies.

440
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,910
The summer is coming to an end.

441
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,110
I'm afraid I won't have a chance to enjoy it.

442
00:23:50,570 --> 00:23:52,260
Not necessarily.

443
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:17,760
So, you knew how I felt

444
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:20,330
and thus prepared these?

445
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:21,980
If you like it,

446
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:26,380
I can pick a star for you.

447
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,300
If you like someone,

448
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,910
it means no matter what he does,

449
00:24:52,910 --> 00:24:54,820
you'll think he's

450
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:55,860
very charming.

451
00:24:56,310 --> 00:24:58,640
And you'll probably experience things like a racing heart,

452
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,000
brain fog,

453
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:02,360
and shortness of breath.

454
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:10,120
Be normal, Cheng Manyi.

455
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:11,590
Calm down.

456
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:13,240
Calm down.

457
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:17,140
You ask me what kind of person I like.

458
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,750
Probably someone who's

459
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:20,120
gentle, elegant,

460
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,520
refined, abstinent,

461
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,780
upright,

462
00:25:22,820 --> 00:25:24,030
and mature.

463
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:27,180
Sometimes, he transforms into a cute and clingy person.

464
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,420
Even though he is the dream man of countless girls,

465
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:35,440
in everyday life, he rarely smiles or speaks to anyone.

466
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,720
His occasional tenderness

467
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,630
blooms only for me.

468
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:41,470
The person you described

469
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,600
is very familiar.

470
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:45,570
He's so similar to my brother.

471
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:49,010
Wei.

472
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,430
You're bad.

473
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,300
My brother and sister-in-law

474
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,420
are real.

475
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,510
You are indeed a perfect match.

476
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:58,950
"Solely for You."

477
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:09,160
Manyi,

478
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:10,580
why are you sighing?

479
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:14,330
Actually, your brother and I

480
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:17,550
haven't officially confessed our love to each other.

481
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:20,150
You are already married.

482
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:22,500
How can you say that?

483
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,960
It was just a contract marriage.

484
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:27,960
I don't know if your brother really likes me

485
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,860
or is it just because I'm his wife.

486
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,450
A real commitment only counts if we formally

487
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,470
and express your feelings.

488
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:38,210
My silly brother doesn't know about that.

489
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:39,360
I'll go find him now

490
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,400
and ask him

491
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,080
to confess.

492
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:45,500
Who said a man must do it?

493
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:50,090
My sister-in-law is really unique.

494
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:52,610
When are you going to confess?

495
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:55,890
Does it matter when I confess?

496
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:58,050
I like someone.

497
00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:00,240
When I fall in love with someone,

498
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,120
I'll take proactive action.

499
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,030
Do it when it's time,

500
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,660
going allâ€¦

501
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:07,270
Brother.

502
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:19,490
I...

503
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,240
Why are you here?

504
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,150
I'm bringing snacks

505
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:29,730
for your tea party.

506
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:36,470
Well,

507
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,460
go on.

508
00:27:55,190 --> 00:27:56,890
I'm not a coward.

509
00:27:57,490 --> 00:27:58,480
Absolutely not.

510
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:01,200
I just want

511
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:03,590
a confession with a sense of ceremony,

512
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:05,670
something memorable for a lifetime.

513
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,740
A sense of ceremony?

514
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:11,260
What is a sense of ceremony?

515
00:28:11,830 --> 00:28:12,670
Wen Chenyi.

516
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:16,530
Actually, I might...

517
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,110
might...

518
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,220
maybe

519
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:21,300
like you

520
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:22,480
a little bit.

521
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:25,250
Alright.

522
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,960
Not just a little bit.

523
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:29,840
How about we try turning the pretense into reality?

524
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:33,580
It's so hard.

525
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:36,370
I've never confessed to anyone in my life.

526
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,330
What is this?

527
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:45,750
Why am I suddenly so useless?

528
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:47,570
I knew it.

529
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,760
Love makes people lose their minds.

530
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,560
By the way,

531
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:02,940
it's time to use

532
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,030
the tricks I learned from dramas.

533
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:06,920
You...

534
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:13,530
[Love Contract]

535
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:10,590
Sign this new contract.

536
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:13,070
Party A, Cheng Manyi,

537
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,320
is to acquire Party B, Wen Chenyi,

538
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:17,540
and to start a deep relationship cooperation.

539
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:18,320
[Love Contract]

540
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,440
As for the contract's validity,

541
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:23,550
let's say it's for a lifetime.

542
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:26,290
Wen,

543
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:28,830
since we get along so well,

544
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:31,010
why don't we become

545
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:34,300
a real couple?

546
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,320
What do you think?

547
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:38,470
You know,

548
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,350
even if the rain turns the city upside down,

549
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:44,070
I'll give you a hug.

550
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:47,080
I can't stand

551
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:49,250
seeing your back.

552
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,110
Write down how I spend each second like a year,

553
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,540
enduring the hardship of separation.

554
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,470
Hey, man.

555
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:58,980
Stop hiding.

556
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:01,340
Don't try

557
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,440
playing hard to get.

558
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:07,060
I know you already have feelings for me.

559
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:10,350
I'll just ask you once.

560
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:12,130
Do you want to date?

561
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:14,470
Do you want to date?
