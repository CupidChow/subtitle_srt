[Episode 19]

3
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,030
Be careful.

4
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:22,740
Be careful.

5
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,300
Please

6
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:29,490
wait for a moment.

7
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,360
Okay.

8
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,490
My mission is done.

9
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:46,860
Young Master, please take it yourself.

10
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:48,320
Okay.

11
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,960
The Yu family

12
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:01,540
is loyal to the Wen family.

13
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,210
I can never do enough to return your favor.

14
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:09,660
This is the jade pendant from my grandfather.

15
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:12,180
I'll give it to you today

16
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,340
to show that our two families will be friends forever

17
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:15,600
and share weal and woe.

18
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:29,350
You cannot open it

19
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,070
unless it's urgent.

20
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,480
I know this very well.

21
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:36,450
I've seen this in dramas.

22
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,110
I guess it's a life-saving bag.

23
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:44,680
We need to discuss it with Father after we go back.

24
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:51,329
But Mayor He is in Fuzhou, which is far from here.

25
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:52,190
Why does he

26
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:55,120
suddenly want to find the treasure of the Wen family?

27
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:59,110
There must be someone who knows the truth.

28
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,640
It must be Grand Master Ning.

29
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:03,700
No wonder

30
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:05,110
a mayor

31
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,670
dared to dig up the levee.

32
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,320
But if we can find evidence to prove it,

33
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,980
it will be a good chance to defeat Grand Master Ning.

34
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:15,770
We need to find a way

35
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,140
to avoid He Lian's suspicion.

36
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,579
Brother Yu.

37
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:23,040
Please

38
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,390
help us.

39
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:25,270
Okay.

40
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:35,950
Manyi.

41
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,510
I didn't handle

42
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:39,950
what happened properly.

43
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,920
I lied to you

44
00:03:41,579 --> 00:03:43,230
and broke my promise.

45
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,220
I know I was wrong.

46
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,110
I'm sorry.

47
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,150
Now you know you were wrong?

48
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:53,300
Do you still remember what you told me?

49
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,050
Do you know

50
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:58,430
how sad I was

51
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,360
to see you take all blame yourself?

52
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,310
I have no right to choose.

53
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,350
I can only accept the result passively.

54
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:06,850
This is more painful than death.

55
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:07,650
But how could I

56
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,500
do nothing but

57
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,630
let you get implicated by the Wen family?

58
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,040
Since you are my husband,

59
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,680
there's nothing to be afraid even if I will die with you.

60
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:19,029
I didn't feel pain

61
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:21,029
when Grand Master Ning tortured me.

62
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,870
Because I knew

63
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,160
whom I fought for

64
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,790
and whom I risked my life for.

65
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:33,820
I promise you.

66
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:37,950
From now on, I will be in the same boat with you

67
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,440
no matter how hard our life will be.

68
00:04:43,010 --> 00:04:44,180
Manyi.

69
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:47,210
Are you still willing to trust me?

70
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:53,180
I...

71
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:53,990
Manyi!

72
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:56,760
Manyi, are you okay?

73
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:58,170
I'm fine.

74
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,190
Come on. Stand up.

75
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:01,660
Come on. Stand up.

76
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,670
Thank you for coming in time.

77
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:16,420
Otherwise, we would have died.

78
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:22,720
I searched everywhere

79
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,460
and overcame a lot of difficulties

80
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,800
before I found this place

81
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,680
and saved you.

82
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:28,710
Your Highness have great foresight.

83
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:30,730
I am greatly impressed.

84
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:33,880
Since you are safe now,

85
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:37,940
I'll capture the assassin

86
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:40,020
with my martial arts.

87
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:45,110
A long delay may cause trouble.

88
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,990
Once Mayor He is suspicious

89
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,220
and gets prepared,

90
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,280
the situation will be extremely unfavorable to us.

91
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,890
That's why we must act as soon as possible.

92
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:55,100
Why don't we take Brother Yu back to the capital

93
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:56,440
to let him meet Father?

94
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,840
Mayor He is just a nobody.

95
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,540
When we go back to the capital,

96
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:03,200
Grand Master Ning will keep him silent forever.

97
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,720
The most important thing now

98
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,770
is their contact letters.

99
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,480
That's the solid evidence.

100
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:09,860
That makes sense.

101
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:17,990
How do you feel right now?

102
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,000
Amazing, right?

103
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,150
Come on.

104
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,910
Drink more if you like it.

105
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:22,350
Here.

106
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:27,700
What is the working hour of government officials?

107
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:30,040
They usually

108
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,510
start work at sunrise

109
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:32,760
and clock off at dusk.

110
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:37,090
It seems that only the guards

111
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,030
are on duty now in the Mayor's Mansion.

112
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:39,909
They are

113
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,909
off guard now.

114
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,050
Then we have a whole night to plan.

115
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:50,770
Let's pretend to advance along one path

116
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,870
while secretly going along another.

We'll split up into three groups tomorrow.

119
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:00,840
Feng Qiwu invited He Lian to a banquet in the Xiangyue Restaurant

120
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,780
in the name of the Prince.

121
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,500
The restaurant is in the east of Fuzhou City.

[Government Office] [Xiangyue Restaurant]

123

It's very far from the government office.

Once something happens,

125
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:11,450
it'll be hard for him to arrive as soon as possible.

126

Good.

He Lian is cunning.

133
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:33,220
In order to prevent himself from being betrayed,

134
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:36,750
he must have kept all letters between him and Grand Master Ning.

135
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,490
So I have to trouble you, Brother Yu.

136
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:39,510
Please sneak into the mansion

137
00:07:39,510 --> 00:07:40,800
and look for those letters

00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:00,500
Kill all these rebels.

177
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,420
Kill them all!

178
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:02,110
Roger that!

179
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:11,900
A bunch of losers.

180
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,270
They must still be here.

181
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:14,410
Search!

182
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,760
Put down your weapons!

183
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:20,700
Put down your weapons!

184
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,350
Put them down!

185
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:21,830
Put them down!

186
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,090
Step back. Otherwise, they will hurt me.

187
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:25,050
Step back!

188
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,520
Move! Make the way.

189
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:40,800
Oh no!

190
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,370
Back off!

191
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:46,210
Back off!

192
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,870
So what's the point of arresting me?

193
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,770
I will still be innocent even if you send me to the capital,

194
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:58,850
because you have no evidence.

195
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,560
Even if you don't admit it,

196
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:03,670
the letters between Grand Master Ning and you

197
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,100
will show everything.

198
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:05,960
A thing cannot exist

199
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,240
without its basis.

200
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,460
Mayor He also knows this saying, right?

201
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,960
Cooperating with us now

202
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:13,530
will be the only way out.

203
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:15,090
No.

204
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:17,900
The only way out

205
00:11:18,670 --> 00:11:19,890
is to kill you all here.

206
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:20,550
Kill them all

207
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,420
no matter what it takes.

208
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,080
Don't move.

209
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:28,420
I am the Fifth Prince of the Feng State.

210
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,170
Whoever dares to come forward

211
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:34,520
[Order]

212

213
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,670
Let's see who dares.

214
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,550
Get in. Hurry.

215
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:43,340
Wen Chenyi.

216
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:44,570
You go first.

217
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,250
Go.

218
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:47,710
Let's go.

219
00:11:58,220 --> 00:11:59,540
These are letters

220
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,220
found in the Mayor's Mansion.

221
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:04,680
Wang has settled down.

222
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,370
Thank you for saving my life.

223
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:09,460
You're welcome, Brother Yu.

224
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,960
Now we have both witness and evidence.

225
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,640
Even if Grand Master Ning is capable,

226
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:17,190
there's no chance for him to turn the table.

227
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:26,470
Ambush!

228
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,110
Go back.

229
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:27,390
What?

230
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,250
I'll cover you.

231
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:31,420
Kill them all!

232
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:35,960
Let's go.

233
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,510
Protect He Lian.

234
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,070
Keep up.

235
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:46,830
Okay.

236
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:51,190
Be careful!

237
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:03,990
Manyi, we're here to save you.

238
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,500
Manyi, I'm here to save you.

239
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,070
Retreat!

240
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:06,860
Stop!

241
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,180
Where is Manyi?

242
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:10,110
That way.

243
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:15,860
Luckily that you are fine.

244
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:20,650
Honey.

245
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,920
What should I do?

246
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:30,520
Wen Chenyi!

247
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:33,150
Wen Chenyi!

248
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,540
You can't die.

249
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:37,010
You can't.

250
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,080
I haven't forgiven you yet.

251
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:40,860
Wen Chenyi.

252
00:13:41,890 --> 00:13:43,270
I haven't forgiven you yet.

253

You can't die.

254
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,710
You can't leave me alone.

255
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:50,590
I can't live without you.

256
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,760
Wen Chenyi, wake up!

257
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:54,190
I can't live without you.

258
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,870
I can't live without you.

259

Wen Chenyi.

260
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,130
Wake up!

261
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:09,580
Wen Chenyi.

262
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,280
You'll be fine.

263
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:13,710
Here comes the water.

264
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:20,500
Fortunately, Jiaobai found

265
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,440
there was something fishy with Grand Master Ning in the capital.

266
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,770
He reported to Master Cheng and me in time.

267
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,710
Unfortunately,

268
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,230
I was too late.

269
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,260
It's my fault.

270
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,460
He wanted to save me.

271
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:40,580
Don't worry, Young Madam.

272
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,040
Young Master will be fine.

273
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,610
I'm going to start.

274
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:48,470
I trust you.

275
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:17,900
Wen Chenyi.

00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,240
Wen Chenyi.

277
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:24,320
Something is wrong with the arrow.

278
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:26,430
What do you mean?

279
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,440
It's the Body-breaking Powder.

280
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:35,810
Is this

281
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:39,440
the Body-breaking Powder,

282
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:40,520
the strongest poison in the world?

283
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:41,850
Poisoned by this toxin,

284
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:43,690
one cannot be cured

285
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,180
by the best antidote.

00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,760
Are you sure?

288
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:51,640
Young Master was poisoned by the same toxin

289
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:53,160
when he was nine.

290
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:55,050
The poison marks are the same.

291
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,510
I can recognize them even if they turn into ashes.

292
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,550
It's Grand Master Ning. It's him.

293
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,720
How strong the grudge could be

294
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,250
that it irritated him

295
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:12,180
to murder a nine-year-old child?

296

Young Madam.

297
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:16,670
The doctor who saved Young Master passed away long time ago.

This is the Medical Code from my ancestors.

There are over 2,000 ways to cure the poison.

310

One of them is called the Phoenix Grass, which can detoxify all poisons.

311

he has to die.

00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:20,930
I'm not afraid of death.

351
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:22,900
I'm just afraid

352
00:18:23,990 --> 00:18:25,790
that I can't be with you forever.

353
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:31,350
Listen.

354
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,340
If you don't keep me company,

355
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,760
I'll go find another man.

356
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:38,710
If you felt happy by doing so,

357
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,190
I would also be happy.

358
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:50,910
All right.

359
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,380
I was just kidding.

360
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:54,850
Don't worry.

361
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,660
I won't give you the chance to find another man.

362
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:01,670
I will live on.

363
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:05,820
That's more like it.

364
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,500
I am thinking about holding another wedding ceremony

365
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,750
after you recover.

366
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,760
The wedding here is too old-fashioned.

367
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:19,520
For example?

368
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:22,340
For example,

369
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,790
we will pave the way with flowers.

370
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:31,870
Flowers girls

371
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:34,200
will hold the hemline of my wedding dress.

372
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:41,060
We will also have an arch decorated by flowers.

373
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:46,380
â™«It's like deep and true love losing to timeâ™«

374
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:43,200
We will go through

375
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:44,480
the arch

376
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:46,840
together

377
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:53,590
â™«Only sadness and wounds can be commemoratedâ™«

378
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,220
and play a duet

379
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:55,190

380
00:19:54,180 --> 00:20:00,350

â™«When do we feel loved and indebtedâ™«

â™«It seems as if deep affection is captured in filmâ™«

384
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,210
Wen Chenyi

385
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:23,030
It's okay.

386
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:29,080
â™«Crying, laughing and fading, so the drama can be praisedâ™«

387
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,160
It's okay.

388
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,120
It's okay. It's okay.

389
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,940
Don't worry.

390
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:35,240
â™«The curtain falls, leaving an extra moment of warmthâ™«

391
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:33,520
Young Madam.

392
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:34,310
Young Madam.

393
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:34,790
Manyi.

394
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:35,470
Manyi.

395
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:37,440
Have you found the Phoenix Grass?

396
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,110
No.

397
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:40,010
But a friend of mine

398
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:41,590
told me

399
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,600
that there is the Legendary Physician

400
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,520
whose name is Tang Jueming.

401
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,540
He likes to collect all kinds of rare flowers and herbs.

402
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:48,340
He may have the Phoenix Grass.

403
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,450
Where can we find Tang Jueming?

404
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:53,920
He has been hiding in the Soul-Breaking Mountain.

405
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,150
It is said

406
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,600
that he is extremely eccentric and ill-tempered.

407
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,450
It will be difficult

408
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,410
to get the Phoenix Grass from him.

409
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:03,600
It's fine.

410
00:21:05,070 --> 00:21:07,750
I'll do anything to save Wen Chenyi.

411
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,400
Honey.

412
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:13,890
Let's go find the Legendary Physician.

413
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:16,020
Everyone,

414
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,260
thank you for your care.

415
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,320
But

416
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:22,530
don't delay your business because of me.

417
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,860

420
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,850
Go back to the capital as planned

421
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32,670
and stall Grand Master Ning.

422
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:36,220
Manyi and I will go back to the capital later

423
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,560
and have a further discussion with you.

424
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:40,780
Okay.

425
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:00,310
Be careful.

426
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,210
Get up.

427
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,690
Are you okay?

428
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:09,990
Feng Qiwu?

429
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:10,970
Why are you here?

430
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,130
I'm here to share weal and woe with you.

431
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:14,180
I thought about it.

432
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:16,240
You wouldn't agree if I told you.

433
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,020
But I was worried about you.

434
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:19,600
So I came uninvited.

435
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,940
I'll carry him on my back.

436
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:24,930
Take a rest.

437
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:25,910
Let's go.

438
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:28,080
Thanks, Wu.

It's here!

What is it?

00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,050
What on earth is the answer?

445
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:52,910
What on earth is the answer?

What on earth is the answer?

Tell me what the answer is.

He looks lunatic.

What is it?

450
00:23:00,550 --> 00:23:02,060
What does this mean?

451
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:03,980
Are we going to solve the riddles?

452
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:05,640
I'll put him down first.

I'll take a look there.

Okay.

456
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:22,860
Tell me, what is the answer?

457

What is the answer?

Go away.

the answer is.

462
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:37,670
You only

463
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,630
have one chance.

Sir.

465
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,510
You said that we only had one chance to answer the question.

466
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:46,010
One chance for everyone or everyday?

you missed the chance,

you would have to wait seven more days.

We only have the chance once every seven days?

Yes.

Do we have to try all possibilities according to the order on the compass?

Eight trigrams

487

may provide a solution,

488

but constellations may lead to another.

489
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:39,380
Those are two completely different solutions.

490
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:41,840
Let's choose one of them. Let's try it first.

00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:56,330
Here.

522
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,750
Everything is formless.

523
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,580
Everything is born in mind.

524
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:02,810
Formless?

525
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,680
Born in mind?

526
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:06,280
What does this mean?

527
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,470
Formless.

528
00:26:10,110 --> 00:26:11,160
Born in mind.

529
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:14,310
Formless.

530
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:15,740
Born in mind.

531
00:26:18,670 --> 00:26:19,870
I know the answer now.

532
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:26,440
The crossbows are moving.

533
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:29,040
They are moving, Manyi.

534
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:46,680
I guessed it right.

535
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:48,560
Everything is just a cover-up.

536
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,190
There is no standard answer at all.

537
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:50,720
Yes.

538
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:52,710
Let's go in.

539
00:26:52,750 --> 00:26:54,260
Okay, I'll help him.

540
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:55,270
Let's go.

541
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:03,750
Slowly.

542
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:04,760
Be careful.

543
00:27:04,780 --> 00:27:05,510
Okay.

544
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:07,270
Look ahead.

545
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:07,770
Okay.

546
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:16,260
Be careful.

547
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:18,720
Here.

548
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:26,920
I think someone is here.

549
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:32,480
I am Cheng Manyi.

550
00:27:32,510 --> 00:27:34,770
I am here to see the Legendary Physician.

551
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,300
Legendary Physician.

552
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,700
Please save my husband!

553
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:54,020
What...

554
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:55,210
Why are you here?

555
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:58,700
Are you Tang Jueming, the Legendary Physician?

556
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:01,430
Did you have fun pretending insane?

557
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:03,650
Yes, I did.

558
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,020
Very interesting.

559
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:07,990
Doctor Tang.

560
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:11,660
My husband was poisoned by the Body-breaking Powder.

561
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:13,260
He is in critical condition.

562
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:15,720
Please save him with the Phoenix Grass.

563
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:16,960
You are greedy.

564
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,310
You are here for the Phoenix Grass, the most precious herb.

565
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,370
Keep daydreaming.

566
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:21,780
I won't save him.

567
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:22,720
Go back.

568
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:27,170
You have to save him today.

569
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:29,000
No space for negotiation.

570
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:31,430
It's useless to threaten me.

571
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:35,000
He's seriously ill.

572
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:38,220
Even the Phoenix Grass

573
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:41,190
may not be able to cure him.

574
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:46,810
Even if there is only a ray of hope,

575
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:49,390
I will try my best to save him.

576
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:53,150
Please give me the Phoenix Grass.

577
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:57,330
Is this your way to beg others?

578
00:28:57,350 --> 00:29:00,860
People normally kneel and kowtow to me when they beg for herbs.

579
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:04,250
But look at you. You are pointing the sword at me.

580
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:06,190
As long as you are willing to save him,

581
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:07,900
I can even give my life to you,

582
00:29:08,470 --> 00:29:10,400
let alone kneeling and kowtowing.

583
00:29:13,610 --> 00:29:14,460
Okay.

584
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:16,900
You are kind and loyal

585
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:18,690
and don't play by the book.

586
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,390
I like it.

587
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:24,670
I'll give you a chance.

588
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,610
Thank you, Doctor Tang.

589
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,160
Too early to say so.

590
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:33,130
Since you are willing to give me your life,

591
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:37,130
try the medicine for me.

592
00:29:37,990 --> 00:29:39,050
What do you mean?

593
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:49,010
I fed five bugs with ten thousand kinds of poison.

594
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:52,080
I need someone to test the poison for me.

595
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:53,390
Cheng Manyi.

596
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:55,560
Test the poison for me

597
00:29:55,670 --> 00:29:57,210
in exchange of the Phoenix Grass.

598
00:29:57,210 --> 00:30:00,340
A life for an antidote.

599
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:01,810
It's a good bargain.

600
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:05,110
No!

601
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:10,290
Okay, I will do it.

602
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:11,540
No!

603
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:13,170
No!

604
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,070
Manyi.

605
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:18,930
Manyi.

606
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,150
No!

607
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:23,000
It's okay.

608
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:23,750
No!

609
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:25,360
No, Manyi.

610
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:26,650
No, Manyi.

611
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:29,360
You're going to die.

612
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:30,350
That's right.

613
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:33,100
If you get bitten by them,

614
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:37,160
I'm afraid the probability of being alive is the same as your husband.

615
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:38,890
Did you hear what he said?

616
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:40,770
Even if we had the Phoenix Grass,

617
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:42,970
Wen Chenyi would die.

618
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,310
Why do you have to risk your life?

619
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:48,430
Because I can't stand by

620
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:52,010
and let Wen Chenyi die.

621
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:53,610
No.

622
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,640
No. Senior.

623
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:58,320
No. Senior.

624
00:30:58,330 --> 00:30:59,380
I don't agree.

625
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:01,470
Doctor Tang.

626
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:03,270
When shall we start?

627
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:06,190
Right now.

628
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,120
Feng Qiwu.

629
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,460
Kill me.

630
00:31:12,710 --> 00:31:14,540
Kill me.

631
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:16,260
Fine.

632
00:31:17,150 --> 00:31:18,310
I'll do as you wish.
