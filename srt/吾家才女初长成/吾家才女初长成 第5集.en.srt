Do you want to practicing the qin?

Tell me your ideas.

174
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,410
Play the qin as usual tomorrow.

175
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:15,200
But when you play it, you need to pretend that it doesn't fit

176
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:19,090
and break the strings with your strength.

177
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,940
Then you can pretend that your fingers are injured

178
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,760
and can't play the qin. This will be a way out.

179
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,560
That sounds practical. If the strings are broken

180
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:29,970
and my fingers are injured, how can I play the qin?

181
00:10:29,970 --> 00:10:30,550
Let's go.

182

No.

It doesn't hurt anymore.

Your Highness.

195

I got a jade pendant yesterday

196
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,980
which looks exactly the same

197
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,710
as yours.

198
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:41,350

Yes, it's mine.

Did you lose it on the saddle?

204

You're so heavy. Come on!

205

What saddle?

206
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,150
I have never seen any saddle.

if you have no evidence.

209

I am too excited to wait any longer.

Mr. Zhang, come here.

Please bring the qin here.

What are they doing?

233
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,110
I'm afraid an ordinary qin is not good enough for you to play.

234
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,670
It might affect your performance.

235
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:44,940
That's why I asked people to look for these qin with high quality.

236
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:48,170
They all have beautiful sounds. Feel free to choose.

237
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,430
Vice Censor-in-Chief Du, you're really considerate.

238
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,490
There's more.

Who is he?

241
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:08,170
I'm afraid someone might get hurt or feel uncomfortable while playing the qin.

242
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:10,050
So I asked a famous doctor

243
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:12,400
to prepare the medicine and provide first aid here.

244

Mr. Wen, why?

249
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,070
Vice Censor-in-Chief Du, let me explain it to you. My wife is introverted.

250

She is surrounded by many talented people here.

251
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,920
I'm afraid she might feel uncomfortable.

252
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,680
If the gauze can be put down,

253
00:15:59,710 --> 00:16:02,110
she will have no worry to play the qin here.

254

We will wait for her outside.

Isn't it wonderful?

257
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:41,950
What Miss Cheng is playing is a traditional yet beautiful song.

258
00:16:41,950 --> 00:16:45,370
It sounds as beautiful as shattering jade and dew-weeping lotuses.

259

That's right.

260

Impossible. She can't play the qin.

00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:35,300
You are Wen Chenyi.

340
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,270
♫The candle is burning out; The dawn is breaking♫

341
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:42,470
I knew it.

342
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:43,400
♫The moon knows my thoughts♫

343
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:45,970
Only Wen Chenyi

344
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:47,690
♫Life is so long, I hope to spend♫

345
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,670
will be with me

346
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,860
♫The rest of my life with you♫

347
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:51,030
when I am in trouble

348
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,950
and feel desperate.

349
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:55,040
♫It's a long way to go♫

350
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,110
Only Wen Chenyi will help me.

351
00:22:55,420 --> 00:23:04,750
♫May I have a lifelong partner♫

352
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,910
♫Let me be your lover♫

353
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:10,660
Did I say thank you to you?

354
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:12,990
♫Hope you can get to know my love♫

355
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:17,060
♫Wait for the arrangement of fate♫

356
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:20,170
♫Let us be together♫

357
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:20,480
Thank you. Thank you.

358

♫It's a long way to go♫

359

♫I want to be with you forever♫

360
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,010
Actually,

361
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:30,090
I should

362
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,770
thank you.

363
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:38,230
♫In halcyon days♫

364
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:41,700

367
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:53,150
♫Let that story be sloppy♫

368
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:56,650
♫It's worth the love♫

369
00:23:56,890 --> 00:24:00,300
♫It's good that it's you♫

370
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:03,590
♫It's okay to be a little late♫

371
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:31,110
Why…

372
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,920
Why did I sleep here?

373
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:35,850
Why did you sleep here?

374
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,390
Let me think

375
00:24:37,430 --> 00:24:38,850
where to start.

376
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,960
Yi, are you awake?

377
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:49,760
I made chicken soup for you.

378
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,430
Be careful.

379
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,670
It's inappropriate to display your affection

380
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:18,720
in public.

381
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:21,540
You two should kneel in the ancestral hall as punishment.

382
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,580
I'm sorry

383
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:24,390
for involving you.

384
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,130
Don't be angry.

385
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,430
Think from another perspective.

386
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,500
It's not necessarily a bad thing to kneel in the ancestral hall,

387
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:38,700
especially for writers like you.

388
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:40,210
You are experiencing life

389
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:42,170
and accumulating materials for your writing.

390
00:25:42,170 --> 00:25:43,710
In that case,

391
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:46,070
I should thank you.

392
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:49,090
No worries.

393
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:51,680
Just don't be angry.

394
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,980
This is the first time you kneel in the ancestral hall, right?

395
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,840
I've done many things for the first time

396
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,280
because of you.

397
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:03,080
Yes.

398
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:05,670
But there are many beautiful memories.

399
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,100
Like what?

400
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,490
Like...

401
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:16,570
Like…

402
00:26:16,670 --> 00:26:18,060
I saw nothing.

403
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,220
And like…

404
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:32,950
No, I cannot think about any beautiful memory.

405
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:35,620
There have been some.

406
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,780
What's wrong?

407
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:58,820
I'm fine.

408
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,090
Just some coldness inside my body.

409
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:05,040
That's serious. Why are you still pretending tough?

410
00:27:12,610 --> 00:27:14,380
Wait here. I'll get someone.

411
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:23,140
If you didn't punish Yi to kneel in the ancestral hall,

412
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,760
he wouldn't have had a cough.

413
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,590
My son suffered a lot.

414
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:31,430
I'm afraid he'll have to spend his birthday in illness.

415
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:33,830
Honey, calm down.

416
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:34,890
Don't be sad.

417
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,150
Yi

418
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:37,450
is not greedy.

419
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,120
He never celebrates his birthday.

420
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,920
He won't be unhappy because of this.

421
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,620
How could you say that?

422
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,060
As his mom, I wish that

423
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:45,300
he could spend his birthday

424
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,860
in peace.

425
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:49,260
Yes, you're right.

426
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:52,070
I'll find the best doctor in the city to treat Yi.

427
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:52,930
Hurry up.

428
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:10,830
You're awake.

429
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:13,900
Luckily, you're fine.

430
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:16,100
Have you been taking care of me all the time?

431
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,230
Who else can take care of you except me?

432
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,430
I am exhausted

433
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:23,160
for taking care of you.

434
00:28:25,430 --> 00:28:26,690
Thank you, Miss Cheng.

435
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:30,530
How are you going to return me the favor?

436
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,770
Is she

437
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:35,340
coveting my body, isn't she?

438
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:38,060
You're fully recovered, aren't you?

439
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:39,660
I knew it.

440
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:42,930
Yes.

441
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,030
That's good.

442
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:47,850
Get up. Get dressed and come with me.

443
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:57,670
Why did you bring me here?

444
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:00,520
Without doubt, to buy fabrics.

445
00:29:00,550 --> 00:29:02,910
Your task today is to be a model

446
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:05,600
and help me pick out the most suitable style.

447
00:29:05,630 --> 00:29:06,950
Model?

448
00:29:07,730 --> 00:29:08,960
What is this?

449
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,880
You need to

450
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:17,300
put on the clothes and walk like this.

451
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:21,110
Don't look. What are you doing?

452
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:22,590
Go over there.

453
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:24,650
Stop in front of me.

454
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:27,390
Turn around clockwise and then counter-clockwise.

455
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,520
Where are you going?

456
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:32,250
I am in no mood

457
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,440
to have fun with you.

458
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:34,540
Goodbye.

459
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,750
Stop there!

460
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:39,080
You don't want to return the favor to me?

461
00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:41,600
I'm the Greatest Scholar of the Feng State.

462
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,500
How could I do such a strange thing?

463
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,700
It's inappropriate!

464
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:46,930
As long as you're not afraid of being embarrassed,

465
00:29:46,930 --> 00:29:48,730
just walk out with your head high.

466
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:50,790
I won't return the belt to you anyway.

467
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,400
Give it to me.

468
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:52,790
You won't win if we fight.

469
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:53,590
Stop it.

470
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:57,590
Sir, please show me all your fine fabrics.

471
00:29:57,630 --> 00:29:58,670
I can afford it.

472
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,920
Guys, move!

473
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:01,910
Yes.

474
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:03,910
Cheng Manyi!
