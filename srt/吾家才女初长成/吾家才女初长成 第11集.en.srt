[A Talented Girl Grows Up]

2
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,840
[Episode 11]

3
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:16,920
The so-called "Melodic Recognition"

4
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:18,930
involves five Guqin players performing

5
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,660
five different pieces of music simultaneously.

6
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:22,420
The first party

7
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,700
to distinguish all five pieces

8
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,230
amidst the cacophony wins.

9
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:17,420
Grieving Spirit,

10
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,910
Palace Secret Rhythm,

11
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,170
West Wind's Fury,

12
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:39,780
Mysterious Orchid,

13
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:41,120
and Mulberry Tree of the Path.

14
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,560
Feng Qiwu gave up.

15
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,850
Sangyi's man guessed the five pieces first.

16
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:45,980
We're going to lose.

17
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:48,770
It's all my fault

18
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,710
that the academy...

19
00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:54,660
I'll get it back to you later.

20
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:57,820
No, look.

21
00:02:58,340 --> 00:02:59,660
He hasn't given up.

22
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:00,420
He is just...

23
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,900
focusing on recognizing the pieces.

24
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,060
Have you finished guessing?

25
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,130
Yes.

26
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,280
My turn, then.

27
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,380
Everyone,

28
00:03:23,630 --> 00:03:24,950
the first piece

29
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,620
employs the techniques of yin, nao, chuo, and zhu.

30
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,750
The final note falls on the Shang tone.

31
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,940
It doesn't end with the Yu tone, like "Grieving Spirit,"

32
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:35,070
but rather, it is from the same school

33
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,890
and equally a masterpiece:

34
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:39,100
"Living Soul."

35
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:43,910
The second piece

36
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:48,070
was once popular in Sangyi

37
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,430
but was banned

38
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:53,720
due to its excessively decadent nature.

39
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,150
Unfortunately,

40
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:58,960
it's a minor tune derived from "Palace Secret Rhythm"

41
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,440
and "Drunken Fragrance."

42
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:05,130
The third piece is indeed

43
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,740
"West Wind's Fury."

44
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:09,690
However, the fourth and fifth pieces

45
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,630
are Hu tunes: "Falling off a Horse"

46
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,590
and "Just a Dream."

47
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:17,019
Feng Qiwu answered correctly.

48
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:18,310
Feng's won!

49
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,310
Awesome!

50
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,450
Awesome! Awesome!

51
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:23,220
Bravo!

52
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:24,980
Good.

53
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,380
Awesome! Awesome!

54
00:04:32,409 --> 00:04:34,080
I intended to lose,

55
00:04:34,130 --> 00:04:35,690
but my skills were too good to allow it.

56
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:38,490
After all, entertainment is my forte.

57
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,580
Don't get too cocky.

58
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,260
We're still two wins away from victory.

59
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:42,740
Two...

60
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,750
The fourth round is

61
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,210
"Watching the Fan and Recreating the Painting."

62
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:48,330
Please send out your contestants.

63
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:53,780
I'll take the challenge.

64
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,290
Master competing himself, we can win this round for sure.

65
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:56,570
I believe you can do it.

66
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,909
Brother, come on!

67
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:00,790
Come on!

68
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:04,770
"Watching the Fan and Recreating the Painting"

69
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:08,350
is about observing a partially folded fan

70
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:10,800
and using the half painting on it to infer

71
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,170
and redraw the complete fan design.

72
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:17,760
The person who finishes the drawing accurately and in the shortest time wins.

73
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:40,310
Cui Jun.

74
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,430
You keep an eye on our opponent.

75
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,860
You keep your eyes on the fans.

76
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,409
I'll keep an eye on the table

77
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,830
in case they play tricks again.

78
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:48,390
Okay.

79
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:07,770
Why...

80
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,750
Why is there a fire?

81
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,950
How can we compete like this?

82
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:11,870
Yeah.

83
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,360
How can we compete, then?

84
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,870
Scholar Wen,

85
00:06:23,970 --> 00:06:26,950
would you like to observe my folding fan with me?

86
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,350
Thank you,

87
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:30,790
but...

88
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,100
no need.

89
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,620
Feng will win!

90
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:05,550
Awesome.

91
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:06,870
Awesome.

92
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,250
Feng will win!

93
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,910
Feng will win!

94
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,910
In the fourth round of the competition, Feng wins.

95
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,600
Good.

96
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,150
In the presence of absolute skill,

97
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,610
any scheme or trick is nothing.

98
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:29,130
The fifth round is

99
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,040
the "Scholar Debate."

100
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:33,630
Please send out your final contestant.

101
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:35,340
Manyi,

102
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:36,770
whether we can win or not

103
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:37,830
now depends on you.

104
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:39,909
Manyi,

105
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:41,950
just go for it with your eyes closed.

106
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:43,669
I believe you can do it.

107
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:49,430
Manyi,

108
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:53,010
do you still remember what I told you?

109
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:55,670
Well,

110
00:08:55,710 --> 00:08:57,560
what if I lose?

111
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:58,770
It doesn't matter.

112
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,430
I will bear

113
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:02,990
all the consequences alongside you.

114
00:09:03,310 --> 00:09:06,050
Whether we win or lose,

115
00:09:06,190 --> 00:09:07,790
it's the result of teamwork.

116
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:09,890
You don't have to

117
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,570
take all the responsibility on yourself.

118
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:15,190
For you...

119
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:18,650
the academy, and Feng,

120
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,490
I will do my best.

121
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:23,340
I believe in you.

122
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,830
Manyi! Manyi!

123
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:30,410
Manyi! Manyi!

124
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,120
Manyi! Manyi!

125
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,720
This debate topic this time is:

126
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,740
Is it better to govern through culture

127
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:38,370
or through military force?

128
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,650
The person who draws the short straw

129
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:41,920
argues for governing through culture,

130
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,270
while the one who draws the long straw argues for
governing through military force.

131
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:48,320
Both sides can freely express their views.

132
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,250
The first to convince the audience wins.

133

[Short]

134
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,440
[Long]

135
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:09,240
Are you trying to get me killed?

136
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:10,710
Everyone knows

137
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:12,190
that governing a country through culture is better.

138
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,770
Take the Feng State as an example.

139
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:15,720
The Emperor of Feng values literature and respects scholars,

140
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,960
rules with virtue, practices benevolent governance,

141
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,910
opposes violence, and promotes education and moral cultivation.

142
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,170
All citizens pay more attention to literature.

143
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:22,730
What a vicious topic.

144
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,110
The difficulty of this topic

145
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:26,030
lies in

146
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:27,010
that if we argue,

147
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:30,890
we'll be challenging Feng's imperial system,

148
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,930
risking offending the Emperor.

149
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,860
If we abstain, we'll lose the match,

150
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,630
which will make our country lose face.

151
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,450
The lenient punishment

152
00:10:41,670 --> 00:10:43,870
will be letting others run the academy.

153
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,360
The severe punishment

154
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:49,190
is that the entire Wen family will be beheaded.

155
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,590
Thus, the people of Feng are pure-hearted and honest,

156
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:54,590
and its customs are liberal and enlightened.

157
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:56,030
Governing a country through culture

158
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,470
is the path to prosperity.

159
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:08,770
Of course, governance through culture is not good.

160
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:11,830
Scholars are weak.

161
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,450
They are not as fierce as warriors are.

162
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:16,830
If we govern the country through culture for too long,

163
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,650
our soldiers may rebel,

164
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:21,190
generals could defect to our enemies, the Emperor's authority will wane,

165
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:23,590
and the Feng state will face the danger of destruction.

166
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:24,580
Outrageous!

167
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,010
Calm down, Your Majesty.

168
00:11:27,010 --> 00:11:28,410
Calm down, Your Majesty.

169
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,760
Cheng Manyi,

170
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,690
how dare you

171
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,000
speak so recklessly in public?

172
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,940
Do you know that spouting such treasonous words

173
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,520
is a capital offense?

174
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,680
Your Majesty,

175
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:44,000
don't fall into Sangyi's trap.

176
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:45,730
Those words

177
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:47,400
are what they wanted me to say.

178
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,610
Nonsense!

179
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,070
Let her continue.

180
00:11:58,250 --> 00:11:59,650
Thank you, Your Majesty.

181
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,650
Sangyi pretends to advocate

182
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,900
for our policy of cultural governance,

183
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:14,400
but they have stationed 100,000 elite soldiers at the border.

184
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,060
Clearly,

185
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,140
they aim to confuse us

186
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:20,730
and take advantage of our unawareness

187
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,270
to train their own troops

188
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,560
and secretly bolster their strength.

189
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,410
Their wild ambition is plain to see!

190
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:28,350
Your Majesty, Sangyi has no such intentions.

191
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,960
No such intentions.

192
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,860
You said it yourself

193
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:34,990
in the hall.

194
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:36,640
We were just being prepared.

195
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,340
Sangyi has no disloyal intentions toward Feng.

196
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,760
Your country and ours have been friendly for generations.

197
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,510
Then why do you need to train troops all day

198
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,950
to guard against us?

199
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,760
I'm afraid

200
00:12:49,790 --> 00:12:52,110
only you know your true intentions.

201
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:52,770
Your Majesty,

202
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:53,700
we, Sangyi,

203
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:56,070
are nothing but loyal to you.

204
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:58,830
She's just making unreasonable accusations.

205
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:00,560
Whether you are really on guard

206
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:02,030
or have some plot...

207
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,630
Let me tell you.

208
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,340
We're not afraid.

209
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:09,440
Do you really think

210
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,330
that our wise

211
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,250
and mighty Emperor

212
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:15,750
can't see through your schemes?

213
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:18,340
Our Emperor has long known

214
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:19,650
that as long as there is culture,

215
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:21,230
our dynasty will continue

216
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,020
to flourish dynasty after dynasty.

217
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,300
While the military power is the strong backing

218
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,490
that allows us

219
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,380
to stand firm against outsiders.

220
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:30,880
That's why His Majesty

221
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:33,670
has set up the position of General of Cavalry to guard the borders

222
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:35,310
and the City Guard Department

223
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:37,710
to uphold order and reassure the citizens.

224
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,530
Although I'm not talented,

225
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:42,890
I deeply admire your political insight, Your Majesty.

226
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:45,440
I believe that, compared to ruling solely through culture

227
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,050
or military force,

228
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:50,060
Feng's future lies in managing both civil and military affairs simultaneously;

229
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,520
neither can be neglected.

230
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:55,760
This is the true way of governance.

231
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,250
Please, Your Majesty, don't fault me

232
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:04,110
for revealing the wisdom of your vision in public.

233
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:12,000
Well said.

234
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,070
Good!

235
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:17,970
Thank you, Your Majesty.

236
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:21,660
In this cultural competition,

237
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:23,060
Feng wins.

238
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,910
Bravo! Bravo!

239
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:30,370
Today, students of my nation have not disappointed me.

240
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,230
I am very pleased.

241
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,650
Vice Censor-in-Chief Du,

242
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:34,380
reward them.

243
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:36,590
Yes, Your Majesty.

244
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:37,620
Thank you, Your Majesty.

245
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:38,070
Thank you, Father.

246
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:38,710
Thank you, Your Majesty.

247
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:39,990
Thank you, Your Majesty.

248
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:40,750
Goodbye, Father.

249
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,080
Goodbye, Your Majesty.

250
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:48,140
We won!

251
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,590
We won!

252
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,670
Who would have thought

253
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,350
that this grand and unprecedented competition's prize

254
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:06,670
turned out to be books, paper, and pens?

255
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:10,480
This prize isn't nearly as appealing as a simple autumn outing.

256
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,000
Wen Chenyi, tell me.

257
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:16,000
What snacks should we bring

258
00:15:16,030 --> 00:15:17,360
for tomorrow's outing?

259
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,460
No way.

260
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,740
You have a treasure vault behind my back?

261
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:27,020
If you had come to the study a few more times,

262
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,680
you would've noticed all of this a long time ago.

263
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:33,460
Books. Books.

264
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,190
Nothing but books.

265
00:15:41,910 --> 00:15:44,390
This one looks expensive.

266
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,350
But why haven't you worn it before?

267
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,580
I liked wearing it as a child,

268
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,610
but as I grew older,

269
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:49,690
I stopped.

270
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:52,470
Besides, this is only one half of a pair.

271
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:53,920
Where's the other half?

272
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,070
I gave it to a girl.

273
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:58,050
She once saved my life.

274
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,020
Then,

275
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:05,130
you're going to marry her to repay her kindness, right?

276
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,760
You...

277
00:16:10,830 --> 00:16:12,320
We simply promised each other

278
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,180
that if either of us ever needed help, the other would answer the call.

279
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,100
"Answer the call," huh?

280
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:20,350
That opens up a lot of possibilities.

281
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,110
Wait!

282
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,500
What treasure is this?

283
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,340
The Letter of Commitment.

284
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,560
I almost forgot.

285
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:35,150
Now that the cultural competition is over,

286
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,950
then the commitment letter...

287
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,720
This Letter of Commitment has expired.

288
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:45,500
Does that mean our relationship should...

289
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:47,370
Should what?

290
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:48,260
Should end?

291
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:49,170
We should grow distant?

292
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:50,070
We should grow cold?

293
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:50,970
No!

294
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:55,020
What expiration?

295
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:58,170
You haven't found that ancient painting for me.

296
00:16:58,170 --> 00:16:59,420
Let me tell you.

297
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,300
We are bound tightly

298
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,610
by the contract.

299
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:07,130
Does she not want to take things a step further with me?

300
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,230
It's okay.

301
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,380
As long as we're still bound by a contract,

302
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,780
there's still a chance for something more.

303
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:12,579
Right, right!

304
00:17:12,609 --> 00:17:14,740
We haven't found the ancient painting yet.

305
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,900
So, we're still husband and wife.

306
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:25,400
Besides our fake marriage,

307
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:27,190
he should

308
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:30,070
have some feelings for me, right?

309
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:32,520
Do you have the same feelings for me

310
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,000
that I have for you?

311
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,190
Once we come back from the autumn outing,

312
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:38,590
I need to find a chance to ask her seriously.

313
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:42,380
My Lord, I coated the folding fan with white phosphorus

314
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:44,160
so that it'd ignite on its own, all for your benefit.

315
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,200
Once Wen Chenyi and his men lost,

316
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:49,270
wouldn't the academy be yours?

317
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,470
Idiot!

318
00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:01,390
With such a grave enemy before us,

319
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:04,080
even your daughter has more sense than you do.

320
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,320
We were fortunate today to have Cheng Manyi and Wen Chenyi

321
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,620
turn the tide.

322
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:08,790
If your actions

323
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,300
had harmed the prestige of our Feng,

324
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:18,150
I'd have you flayed alive

325
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,960
to see

326
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,900
if your insides are stuffed with straw.

327
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:25,540
Please spare me.

328
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:27,880
I was foolish.

329
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:29,170
I did it without asking for your permission.

330
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:30,330
Please spare me.

331
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,420
I won't do it again.

332
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,630
I won't do it again.

333
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:34,030
Please spare me.

334
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:36,730
There will be no next time.

335
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,410
There will be no next time.

336
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,130
If there is,

337
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,450
you can go beg the King of Hell for mercy.

338
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:46,000
Thank you, my Lord.

339
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,350
Thank you, my Lord.

340
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:51,180
[A Talented Girl Grows Up]

341
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,520
Come on.

342
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,070
Stand there. Don't move.

343
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:13,320
Hit me. Hit me.

344
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:14,430
I dodge! Come and hit me!

345
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:15,090
Don't move!

346
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:16,360
Hit me.

347
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:22,690
Okay, let me show you

348
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:23,970
the power of my strike!

349
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:26,450
You continue to play. I'll pick it up.

350
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:27,680
Be careful.

351
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:30,600
Young Master.

352
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:32,440
I've found it.

353
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:36,330
Nice.

354
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:37,780
Okay.

355
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,270
Why do you have this?

356
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:48,040
This?

357
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,920
This is something I received

358
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,030
from a boy I saved when I was young.

359
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:55,260
He even promised at that time

360
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,480
that he'd grant me anything I asked for.

361
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:58,890
Are you that sure?

362
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:00,320
I'm not sure about others,

363
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:02,320
but he will never break his promise.

364
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:03,750
So,

365
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,390
should I ask him to marry me,

366
00:20:06,590 --> 00:20:08,990
or ask him to break it off with someone else?

367
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:12,020
I advise you to stop dreaming.

368
00:20:12,390 --> 00:20:13,150
What?

369
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,430
You just want to say

370
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:15,800
that the boy is Wen Chenyi, don't you?

371
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:16,960
Return kindness for kindness.

372
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,690
I'll repay your kindness for him.

373
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:21,250
It's natural that a wife pays for her husband's debts.

374
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,330
Tell me,

375
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:26,280
how should I repay you?

376
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,790
Stay back, Cheng Manyi.

377
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,330
Scholar Wen...

378
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:30,970
He is a man of his word.

379
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,660
I want him to repay me himself.

380
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:34,080
Fine.

381
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:37,020
Anyway, I advise you

382
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,760
not to make any excessive demands

383
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,090
that would only humiliate yourself.

384
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:41,940
I'm laying it out straight for you.

385
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,960
Wen Chenyi would never agree to those demands.

386
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:49,240
Master,

387
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:49,940
-look at mine.
-Let me see.

388
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:52,840
Will he really choose Du Yaqin? What should I do?

389
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:53,910
Cui Jun.

390
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:54,790
Manyi.

391
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,800
Do me a favor.

392
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:56,550
Go ahead.

393
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,930
Ask Wen Chenyi

394
00:20:59,150 --> 00:21:00,350
to meet me in the firefly field

395
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:01,830
tonight at 8 p.m.

396
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:02,630
No problem.

397
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:04,950
Not bad.

398
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:16,360
Give this to Mr. Wen.

399
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:19,310
Tell him to meet me at the pier tonight at 8 p.m.

400
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:20,390
Okay.

401
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:22,630
I'd like to see...

402
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:24,960
if Mr. Wen will keep his promise.

403
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:25,990
My foot.

404
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:28,250
Wen Chenyi will never come to see you.

405
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,860
I told you.

406
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,480
The real world is better.

407
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:52,160
Spicy crayfish, BBQ, movies, and the World Cup.

408
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:55,130
You may even become a police officer when you go back.

409
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:57,120
But this world has Wen Chenyi.

410
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,800
If he likes me, I'll stay.

411
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:00,980
But does he like you?

412
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,170
Did he ever say that?

413
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:03,830
You can't just

414
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,830
hang on to that commitment letter forever.

415
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:07,430
It's time to clear things up.

416
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,950
I'll ask him when he comes.

417
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,740
Why isn't he here yet?

418
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:28,880
He will come.

419
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,780
He won't come.

420
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,310
He will.

421
00:22:34,710 --> 00:22:35,320
Manyi?

422
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:43,660
Why are you here?

423
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:45,620
It is me.

424
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:47,910
I'm here to tell you

425
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,770
that he's not coming.

426
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:54,750
Maybe he forgot the time.

427
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:55,390
He will come.

428
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:56,140
Manyi.

429
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:59,110
He went to meet someone else.

430
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,280
Manyi.

431
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,640
I can't believe we missed each other for so many years.

♫It's like deep and true love losing to time♫

I wouldn't dare dream of taking Manyi's place.

00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:12,670

you still don't like me,

Finding someone who only looks like Wen Chenyi from behind

452
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:47,870

If you feel really upset,

470
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:36,370
you can cry it all out.

471
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,520
It might make you feel better.

I've been single since birth for 20 years,

478
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:01,750
and just when I'm about to get into a relationship,

479
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,870
it suddenly turns into nightmare mode.

480

A mistress wanting to become the legitimate wife.

481

cheating.

What a crazy drama.

484
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:16,450
No scriptwriter would ever dare to write something like this.

let me be honest.

488
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,460
You really don't need to waste your time

489
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:35,470
feeling hurt over the cheating man, Wen Chenyi.

490
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:38,530
There are plenty of good men in Feng.

491
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,440
We don't even have to look far.

492
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:42,350

there's a great choice right by your side.

For example, Jiaobai.

500
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:04,240

00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,990
So, let's break up, fine.

515
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,450
You can rest assured.

516
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:39,140
♫It seems as if deep affection is captured in film♫

517
00:26:35,950 --> 00:26:37,020
But I...

518
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:39,640
I don't want to be...

519
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,910
just your buddy.

520
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:46,090
♫Crying, laughing and fading, so the drama can be praised♫

521
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:42,910
What?

522
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:45,390
Nothing.

♫The curtain falls, leaving an extra moment of warmth♫

524
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,180
Let me show you something.

525
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,760
I've brought the ancient painting you asked me to find

526
00:26:53,150 --> 00:26:59,820
♫I'll gradually be forgotten by time♫

527
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:54,420
for you.

528
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:55,260
Great.

529
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:57,800
I can go home now.

530
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:07,160
♫It's better to part ways than to gather with red eyes♫

531
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:02,850
What do you think?

532
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:03,800
Is this the one?

533
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,360
It looks very similar,

534
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,590
but it's not the one I'm looking for.

535
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:11,480
♫But you left in a hurry♫

536
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:11,830
It's not?

537
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:16,940
♫Leaving me with a darkened theater♫

538
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:15,920
Alright then.

539

♫There's no place to say goodbye♫

540

♫No one forces you to act a certain way towards me♫

541
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:25,020
Manyi, don't be too anxious.

542
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,150
I swear,

543
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,840
even if it costs me everything I have,

544
00:27:28,990 --> 00:27:35,400
♫Heartfelt emotions don't rehearse and then bloom again♫

545
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:31,740
I'll find the real painting for you.

546
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:33,740
Give me some more time,

547
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:34,550
okay?

548
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:36,990
Thank you.

549
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:40,170
♫So please don't push yourself too hard♫

550
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:40,020
Go home and rest.

00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:46,790
♫And don't lie when you're tired. Exit quietly♫

Manyi,

553
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:46,630
it's already very late.

554
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,280
Where are you going?

555
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:53,670
♫In silence♫

556
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:50,900
I have a place to go.

Don't worry.

Boss, get me a...

560
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:09,070
Boss, may I put it on...

561
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:10,530
You want to put in on credit?

562
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:11,810
Do you have a death wish?

563
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:12,820
Get lost now!

I'm the World's Greatest Talented...

565

I don't care

566
00:28:18,970 --> 00:28:20,330
if you're the number one scholar in Feng.

Even if you're the emperor himself,

there's no credit here!

I'm not a beggar.
