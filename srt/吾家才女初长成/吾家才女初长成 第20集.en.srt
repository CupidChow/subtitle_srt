00:01:14,110 --> 00:01:15,190
Feng Qiwu,

4
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:17,870
kill me.

5
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,720
Kill me.

6
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:22,580
Okay.

7
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:24,610
I'll help you.

8
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:27,950
Come with me.

9
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,610
Feng Qiwu, how dare you!

10
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,240
Manyi, let go!

11
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,520
He's dying.

12
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:38,740
I want to reduce his suffering.

13
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,229
Let me be the sinner.

14
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:41,789
Feng Qiwu, let me tell you.

15
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:44,300
It has nothing to do with you.

16
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:46,220
Whether I live or die

17
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:48,370
is none of your business.

18
00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:51,110
Let go!

19
00:01:58,789 --> 00:01:59,910
Let go!

20
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:02,670
Let go!

21
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,800
You did so much

22
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,340
for him.

23
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:16,520
Yes.

24
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:20,600
As long as I can save him,

25
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:23,590
I'm willing

26
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:27,400
to do anything for him,

27
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,790
let alone drug trials.

28
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:38,079
I won't let you die before me.

29
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,150
Fine.

30
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,430
Okay.

31
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,770
Don't delay the drug trial.

32
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,190
Cheng Manyi,

33
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,050
I'll let my five babies bite you one by one.

34
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:01,710
Tell me

35
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:03,840
your feelings.

36
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:08,710
You enjoy testing drugs. You're crazy!

37
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:13,150
You agreed to do a drug trial for your beloved. You're crazy, too.

38
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,490
How do you feel?

39
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:30,940
Nothing.

40
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:33,360
It just hurts a little.

41
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:44,470
It hurts.

42
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,140
It hurts.

43
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,850
It tickles.

44
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,510
It's hot.

45
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,310
I see.

46
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,230
Snake venom

47
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,450
causes pain.

48
00:04:57,909 --> 00:05:00,110
Scorpion venom makes people feel cold.

49
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,230
Centipede poison makes people feel itchy.

50
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:04,460
Toad poison makes people feel hot.

51
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:06,680
Great.

52
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,780
The toxic effects of all the five poisons are clear.

53
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:13,190
But you only tested four kinds of venom.

54
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:16,250
What about the spider venom?

55
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,190
You gave it to me?

56
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,250
Take it.

57
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,150

See?

60
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,140
I told you

61
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:53,560
even the Phoenix Grass couldn't save him.

62
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:54,210
Wen Chenyi!

63
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:56,320
He didn't get away with it.

Yes.

You are lucky this time.

Luckily, Doctor Tang just wanted to scare you.

He has the antidote for five poisons.

Otherwise,

you stood in front of me.

Okay.

She's not yours.

Your Majesty,

129
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,580
the burglary in Fuzhou

130
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:26,140
has nothing to do with me.

131
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,910
Your Majesty, we will see who is talking nonsense

Summon the witnesses.

137
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,670
Yes, Your Majesty.

138
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,770
Grand Minister Ning, you didn't expect that we're alive, huh?

139
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:07,050
If we had died,

140
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:09,830
we could never prove you are the culprit?

141
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:12,190
Can we go back to the capital now

142
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,760
to clear Brother Yu's name?

143
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,600
No hurry.

144
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,870
Grand Master Ning is sinister and vicious.

145
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:19,070
He must have a backup plan.

146
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:21,070
To avoid any accidents on our way,

147
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:23,840
we need to change the evidence in advance

148
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,960
and find someone to pretend to be Mayor He.

149
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,120
Then, we have to leave Fuzhou

150
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,850
in two carriages separately.

151
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:36,990
Father, I assisted Cheng Manyi

152
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,920
in investigating the burglary.

153
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:42,370
I found out that it was Grand Master Ning who manipulated all this.

154
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:44,930
Mayor He was also instigated by him

155
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,550
to destroy the levee,

156
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:49,050
causing people

157
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:50,300
to be displaced.

158
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,300
I beg you, Father,

159
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,450
to punish Grand Master Ning severely.

160
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:57,610
Your Majesty, the Fifth Prince is right.

161
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:01,030
Grand Master Ning sent Mayor He to dig the levee to find treasures in Fuzhou

162
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,870
and framed the laborers.

163
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:04,920
Luckily, Yu Yidao was righteous

164
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:06,300
and saved the laborers.

165
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,610
That's why he was framed as a bandit.

166
00:13:09,150 --> 00:13:11,480
Now we have witnesses and evidence.

167
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,350
Please make the right judgment, Your Majesty.

168
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:15,410
Your Majesty,

169
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:17,190
with the laborers' testimony as evidence,

170
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:19,150
my name can be cleared.

171
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:20,380
Your Majesty!

172
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,400
Your Majesty,

173
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:24,470
it was Grand Master Ning's fault.

174
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:26,680
Grand Master Ning threatened me

175
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:27,670
with the lives of my family.

176
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:29,000
I dared not disobey him.

177
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:31,520
These letters are the evidence.

178
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:35,090
Grand Master Ning even

179
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:38,080
tried to kill me on my way back to the capital

180
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:40,220
to destroy the witness and evidence.

181
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:43,990
It's Grand Master Ning who is behind all this.

182
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,510
Your Majesty, please make the right judgment

183
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:47,110
and give me justice.

184
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:48,460
Nonsense!

185
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:50,510
Your Majesty,

186
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:52,210
they colluded

187
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:53,030
to frame me.

188
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:53,780
Shut up!

189
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:59,070
They have witnesses and evidence.

190
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:00,670
How dare you deny it?

191
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:06,650
Your Majesty,

192
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:08,710
don't you

193
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,910
understand why I did so?

194
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:15,390
I've been looking for treasures, and I targeted the Wen Family,

195
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:15,990
for,

196
00:14:17,530 --> 00:14:19,080
for the good of Feng State.

197
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:19,810
For Feng State's sake,

198
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:21,590
you killed those innocent people

199
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:23,120
and committed crimes, huh?

200
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:24,220
Your Majesty.

201
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,350
I am

202
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,370
the Grand Master of Feng State.

203
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,330
I'd rather be a villain

204
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,670
than be a sinner of Feng State.

205
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:40,370
Guards!

206
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:44,660
Put Grand Master Ning in jail and execute him in autumn.

207
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,170
As for Mayor He,

208
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:47,890
he helped the evil

209
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:49,350
and committed heinous crimes.

210
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:51,070
He should be executed according to the law.

211
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:55,550
But considering his repentance, he will be given a lighter sentence.

212
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:58,170
He will be sentenced to ten years in prison.

213
00:14:58,170 --> 00:14:59,680
His assets will be confiscated.

214
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,590
Take him away.

215
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,080
Go.

216
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:13,720
You worked together to solve the case,

217
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:16,630
saving the people of Feng State

218
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:20,160
and finding out the rotten apple for the court.

219
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,270
It's a great contribution.

220
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,950
I will give you

221
00:15:23,980 --> 00:15:25,180
everything you want.

222
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,420
Your Majesty,

223
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,530
may I ask Your Majesty

224
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,190
to restart the imperial examinations of martial arts

225
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:38,450
and allow women to take part in the exams?

226
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,160
No way.

227
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:40,960
Honey.

228
00:15:41,490 --> 00:15:42,740
Allowing women to attend the exams?

229
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:46,110
What's the use of restarting the imperial examinations of martial arts?

230
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:49,370
Now, the work of the City Guard Department is inefficient.

231
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,430
The case of Grand Master Ning

232
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:53,550
has proved that we cannot let civilian officials wield power alone.

233
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:55,590
In the literary fight before,

234
00:15:56,100 --> 00:16:00,390
Your Majesty agreed that we should govern the country with civilian and military officials.

235
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:03,140
I think it's time to restart the imperial examinations of martial arts.

236
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:05,920
We can't allow women to take the imperial examinations of martial arts.

237
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,840
That's right. It's inappropriate.

238
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:10,950
I think there are many women,

239
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,760
who can tell right from wrong,

240
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,310
distinguish good from evil,

241
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:16,280
and are good at martial arts in Feng State,

242
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,680
like Cheng Manyi.

243
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:21,420
They also want to serve the people

244
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:25,820
and don't want to be trapped in the boudoir.

245
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,170
They are as capable

246
00:16:28,210 --> 00:16:29,290
and talented

247
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,960
as men.

248
00:16:32,030 --> 00:16:33,780
They have great aspirations.

249
00:16:34,190 --> 00:16:34,840
Besides,

250
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:36,590
women

251
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:38,600
have never lost to men.

252
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:42,000
If Your Majesty cares about women's rights,

253
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:42,990
I think

254
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:46,710
it's a great idea to start selecting women officers.

255
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,710
That makes sense.

256
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,530
Come on. Pass my order.

257
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:59,050
We're going to restart the imperial examinations of martial arts.

258
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:00,700
Make everyone knows

259
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,020
that all the people of Feng State,

260
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:05,670
no matter men or women, can take part in the exams.

261
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:07,869
The martial champion

262
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:12,410
will be the next City Guard Censor.

263
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:17,240
Thank you, Your Majesty.

264
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:22,060
[On the 10th day of the first month of the third year of Feng State]

265
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:46,790
This is Wen Xian, my grandfather.

266
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,730
Grandfather?

267
00:17:52,530 --> 00:17:54,000
The trick of a woman disguising as a man

268
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,880
can only fool you ancient people.

269
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:59,000
You can tell this is a woman?

270
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,220
Isn't that obvious?

271
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,620
Your grandfather is a woman.

272
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:06,630
Fine.

273
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:08,930
I will tell you the truth.

274
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:10,160
What do you mean?

275
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,400
I will tell you

276
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,210
the secret that the Wen Family has been hiding.

277
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,130
What's that?

278
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:22,840
Are you actually a member of the royal family?

279
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,910
How did you know that?

280
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,180
Honey, you are so smart.

281
00:18:29,610 --> 00:18:31,600
I was right.

282
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:32,560
Gosh!

283
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,060
It's dramatic.

284
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:36,170
That's a plot used frequently by TV dramas.

285
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:36,900
Tell me then.

286
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,100
Wen Xian, my grandfather,

287
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:45,000
was loved by Feng Yi,

288
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,910
the first Emperor of Feng State.

289
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,840
They promised

290
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,170
to create a world

291
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:52,830
where people can live freely

292
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:55,630
and choose who they love out of their willingness.

293
00:18:58,090 --> 00:18:59,060
But nobody knew

294
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:01,350
she was a woman.

295
00:19:01,850 --> 00:19:03,930
She fell in love with Feng Yi.

296
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:09,570
After giving birth to their baby,

297
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:11,230
they separated.

298
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,640
That's why Wen Xian stayed away from the court

299
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,400
and established the World's Greatest Academy.

300
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,300
[World's Greatest Academy]

301
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:19,990
So,

302
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:23,430
the descendants of the Wen Family are of the royal bloodline.

303
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:26,290
This has always been a hidden danger for Feng State.

304
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:30,170
That's why Grand Master Ning wanted to destroy the Wen Family all the time.

305
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,360
But he didn't know

306
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:33,790
the Wen Family has never intended to usurp.

307
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:36,340
We just want to stay away from the court

308
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:40,010
and keep our family members safe and safeguard Feng State.

309
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:44,500
No wonder Grand Master Ning

310
00:19:44,530 --> 00:19:46,730
said he did so for the good of Feng State.

311
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:51,650
Feng Yi was such a scumbag.

312
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,340
Top scumbag!

313
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:56,320
What does that mean?

314
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,980
Your grandmother gave up everything for him

315
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,130
but he was fickle.

316
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,700
He was a scumbag!

317
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,880
Well.

318
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:09,580
But don't worry.

319
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:12,070
Grand Master Ning has been imprisoned.

320
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,030
Your wish to safeguard the Wen Family and Feng State

321
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:16,070
was achieved.

322
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:20,440
No one can make trouble for the Wen Family.

323
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:25,700
Since you have fulfilled my wish,

324
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:28,510
I should grant your wish.

325
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,030
What do you mean?

326
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:37,180
Don't peek.
