00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:34,430
Based on my extensive experience binge-watching dramas,

5
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:36,710
although this scarecrow may seem unharmed on the surface,

6
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:38,550
it has likely suffered severe internal injuries.

7
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:40,210
In the end, it will burst open.

8
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,910
This is the secret technique of our Cheng family:

9
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:48,110
the 72 Forms of Swordsmanship.

10
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:50,420
72 Forms...

11
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:54,039
What about the remaining 71 forms?

12
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,539
That... that's it.

13
00:01:56,789 --> 00:01:58,770
That slash didn't do anything.

14
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:01,550
This glaive may seem harmless,

15
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:04,080
and in fact, it really can't inflict any harm?

16
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:05,670
Manyi,

17
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,270
the reason we martial arts practitioners

18
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:11,930
perform the fist-palm salute

19
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:13,430
is to show the other person

20
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,870
that we value peace.

21
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:18,310
The purpose of martial arts is to deter,

22
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,950
not to harm.

23
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:22,280
You must always remember this.

24
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,870
How long does it take to master this swordsmanship?

25
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:25,790
Ten years.

26
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:27,650
Sorry to disturb you, Dad.

31
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:40,230

32

that may be more suitable for you.

33

It's said that he's never lost a fight.

In terms of martial arts techniques, raw power, and experience,

but too bulky.

99
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:18,360
He's bound to be slow,

Don't worry.

But I'm not ready yet.

488

never to part.

511
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,740
Honey,

512
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,660
you must be really good at playing the guqin, right?

513
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,810
Why do you say so?

514
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,140
Because...

515
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,960
you always manage to strum the strings of my heart.

516
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,420

Lift your head.

Why are you getting a nosebleed?

521
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:25,500
Doctor,

522
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,180
what's wrong with my wife?

523
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,960
Could it be that this time...

524
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,360
she's really expecting?

525
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,480
Don't say such nonsense!

526
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,160
Don't pressure the kids.

527
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:35,140
We're not in a hurry to have grandchildren to dote on.

528
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,660
Father, Mother,

529
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,440
Yi and Manyi

530
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:40,190
have just consummated their marriage.

531
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:41,230
How could they already be expecting?

532
00:27:41,230 --> 00:27:41,870
Wei,

533
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,440
watch your words.

534
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:46,490
Other than the nosebleed,

535
00:27:46,490 --> 00:27:47,660
are there

536
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:48,820
any other symptoms?

537
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,340
No.

538
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:53,610
This is exactly the strange part.

539
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,090
The nose is the opening of the lungs,

540
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,360
a gateway between the outside world and the body.

541
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,660
Nosebleeds usually occur

542
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,170
due to errant blood flow,

543
00:28:00,420 --> 00:28:03,150
though sometimes they're caused by kidney deficiency

544
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:04,940
or a case of qi deficiency.

545
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:07,040
But judging by your pulse,

546
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:09,070
there is nothing unusual.

547
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,390
Could it be...

548
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:12,870
that I'm not actually ill at all?

549
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:15,280
If it occurs infrequently,

550
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,880
indeed, there's no need to worry.

551
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,280
But if it recurs,

552
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,280
it could be a more serious problem.

553
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:25,610
I'm sure it's just a one-time thing.

554
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,750
There's nothing wrong with me.

555
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:29,040
Look at you,

556
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:30,410
troubling the doctor

557
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:32,630
over something so minor!

558
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:33,370
Come on.

559
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:35,610
Everything is a big deal

560
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:36,800
if it concerns you.

561
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,100
Yi is right.

562
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:39,020
Your matters

563
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,720
are our family's matters.

564
00:28:42,070 --> 00:28:43,410
Thank you, Dr. Song.

565
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:44,380
I'll see you off.

566
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,660
You will be fine.

567
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,530
I'll see the doctor off too.

568
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,540
Why is this happening?

569
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,500
My lady, wait a minute.

570
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:33,880
Perhaps we should just go back.

571
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,920
I want to walk a bit longer.

572
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:10,310
Why?

573
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:15,020
Could it be that the magnetic field between me and this world

574
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,490
is repelling each other?

575
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,530
Honey.

576
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,380
It's been so long.

577
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,890
But you've finally learned to read.

578
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:33,500
Of course.

579
00:30:33,870 --> 00:30:35,780
After studying with Scholar Wen for so long,

580
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:37,080
it wasn't for nothing.

581
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,270
You...

582
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,390
What's wrong?

583
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:41,350
What do you want?

584
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:44,510
I just received a piece of news

585
00:30:44,530 --> 00:30:45,950
from the Verification Office of the Directorate of Astronomy

586
00:30:45,950 --> 00:30:48,010
that I know you'll find interesting.

587
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:50,310
Look.

588
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:54,960
[By the middle of the first month of spring, the Roof aligns;
Fate decrees an untimely parting; One cannot linger long]

589
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:53,650
The Directorate of Astronomy has observed

590
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:55,210
an unusual celestial phenomenon in the heavens.

591
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:56,480
This star alignment

592
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:58,570
will appear on the 15th of next month.

593
00:30:58,730 --> 00:30:59,750
By then,

594
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:01,830
the gate of heaven will open,

595
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:03,150
and it will shine across the sky.

596
00:31:03,150 --> 00:31:07,220
[By the middle of the first month of spring, the Roof aligns;
Fate decrees an untimely parting; One cannot linger long]

597
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,160
I remember.

598
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,190
This is the exact symbol from the ancient painting

599
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:07,860
you've been looking for.

600
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:08,670
Yes.

601
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:10,580
Yes, it is.

602
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,110
This is the star alignment.

603
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:16,210
Heaven...

604
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:18,300
Middle...

605
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:19,500
Come on. Let me see.

606
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:23,770
This is the Directorate of Astronomy's augury.

607
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:25,750
By the middle of the first month of spring,

608
00:31:25,750 --> 00:31:27,480
the Roof aligns.

609
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:30,120
Fate decrees an untimely parting.

610
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:32,240
One cannot linger long.

611
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,310
Fate decrees an untimely parting.

612
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,710
One cannot linger long.

613
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,070
It means that I should go.

614
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,210
If I force myself to stay,

615
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:42,090
I may meet my end here.
