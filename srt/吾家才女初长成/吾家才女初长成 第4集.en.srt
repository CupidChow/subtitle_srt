Recently, people have been missing in the city.

After my investigation,

42
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:35,440
I found out that a group of people

who abducted and sold them.

44
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,250
Maybe they caught Mr. Wen by mistake.

45
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:42,520
Since they want to sell him,

46
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,079
he wouldn't have been killed.

47
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:45,760
Mr. Wen is indeed weak.

48
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:47,520
He was abducted just like that?

Tell me what happened to the robe.

51
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,660
Here's the thing. I saw a strong man on the street today.

52
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:55,250
He bought a lot of wine and food.

It's nothing.

54

But it's weird that his bag

55
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,220
is made of a gorgeous outer robe.

56
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,900
I could tell from the material of this outer robe

57
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,660
that it was clearly something he couldn't afford.

58
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,720
So I came to ask him.

59
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,660
But he didn't even want his robe

60

345
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:48,390
Miss Cheng, this is a little something from us.

346
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,070
Just accept it.

347
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:50,030
Yes, take it.

348
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:52,660
No, I appreciate the sentiment.

349
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:53,630
But I’ll pass on the gifts.

350
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:57,130
Miss Cheng, are you implying that our gifts are insufficient?

351
00:14:57,470 --> 00:14:59,670
No, no, no. Not at all.

352
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,140
Really, it’s not necessary.

353
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,860
Since everyone insists on showing gratitude,

354
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:02,620
I will

355
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:08,080
accept the calligraphy on behalf of my wife.

[Eliminate Treason and Support the Weak]

It says "Eliminate Treason and Support the Weak."

[Eliminate Treason and Support the Weak]

364

Mr. Wen is the World's Greatest Scholar.

365
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,780
To miss a class without cause is quite disrespectful.

366

[Wen's Mansion]

367
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:42,710
In our Feng State, literature is highly valued.

368
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:45,220
Actions that tarnish the reputation of the academy

369
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:46,780
and bring shame to scholars…

370
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,870
That person is Vice Censor-in-Chief Du.

371
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:51,750
He meddles in anything related to the Wen family.

372
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:57,610
He's making a big fuss over nothing. Clearly not a good person.

373
00:15:58,150 --> 00:15:59,780
I'll teach him a lesson.

374
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:02,230
I’ll definitely petition His Majesty

375
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,580
for severe punishment.

376
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:09,630
It wasn't me.

Why are you leaving?

381
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,120
Wait for me.

382
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,220
Vice Censor-in-Chief Du is targeting the Wen family.

383
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:34,200
I suspect your poisoning is likely related to him.

384
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,370
The Wen family has always been targeted by schemers

385
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:37,630
and has been restless.

386
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:40,180
It’s just that we’ve never made it public.

387
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:44,080
Could it all be Vice Censor-in-Chief Du’s doing?

388
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,130
It is him, but not only him.

389
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:51,320
It would be easier if he was alone.

390
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,170
But I believe there must be

391
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:56,770
someone behind him pulling the strings.

392
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,920
A hidden mastermind?

393
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,400
There are suspects, but none are confirmed.

394
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,040
The Wen family has been enduring in silence

395
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,150
to catch a bigger fish.

396
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,890
You're just a sickly person who can't hold an official post.

397
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,030
The Wen family never joins factions,

398
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,890
forms cliques, or stirs trouble.

399
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,359
Why would we be targeted?

400
00:17:22,589 --> 00:17:23,119

For so many years,

I've had you pretend to be weak.

403
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,320
Do you know why?

404
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:34,150
To stay away from court politics and disputes.

405
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:37,170
Yes. The Wen family's status is unique.

406
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:41,000
Once exposed, it would cause turmoil in the court

407
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,280
and disrupt the peace.

408
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,580
I could only make you endure

409
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,530
the pretense of frailty to ensure

410
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:53,880
the Wen family's safety for a hundred years.

411
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,730
Remember, never tell outsiders.

412
00:17:57,150 --> 00:18:00,990
Otherwise, not only our Wen family will be in danger,

413
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:03,740
but those close to you will also

414

suffer unwarranted calamities.

Naturally, it attracts envy.

nearly causing you to be abducted.

430

Thankfully, you taught me that word of wisdom.

But now I realize how important learning is.

My previous approach to your studies was too aggressive.

It’s like pulling up seedlings to help them grow faster, which only has the opposite effect.

00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,660
I instructed her to act this way.

514
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,180
My wife is quite talented.

515
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:36,790
I feared that if the students saw her talents,

516
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:38,520
they might become complacent.

517
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:41,410
So I had her pretend to be foolish in front of others,

518
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:44,170
to encourage the students' eagerness to learn.

519
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,890
Hiding one's abilities is not a good strategy.

520
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,730
Revealing them at the right time

521
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:53,260
can inspire others to study harder.

522
00:22:53,410 --> 00:22:54,480
In my opinion,

523
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:55,840
tomorrow's qin playing meeting

524
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,280
is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

525
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:00,830
Today, I have come to sincerely invite

526
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:03,780
Miss Cheng to perform on stage and play the qin.

527
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,080
Tomorrow's qin playing meeting?

528
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,340
Isn't it a bit rushed?

529
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:12,050
My wife may not be up to the task.

530
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:15,320
Perhaps we should discuss it another day.

531
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:19,360
Don't worry. I've invited high officials and nobles.

532
00:23:19,390 --> 00:23:21,940
Talented scholars and beautiful ladies will gather

533
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:25,740
to exchange and discuss. This matter is settled.

534
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,940
May I ask where the qin playing meeting will be held?

535
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:32,610
Someone will come to inform you tomorrow.

536
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,100
Everyone.

537
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:37,630
Please come and watch the performance tomorrow.

538
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:57,260
The combat was unprecedentedly intense.

539
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,890
Unexpectedly, just as things were happening in a flash,

540
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:03,490
a group of burly men with knives rushed in from the other side.

541
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,310
Luckily, I’ve mastered unparalleled martial arts.

542
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:09,570
I rushed in and pinned them

543
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:12,170
to the ground,

544
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:17,570
leaving them no choice but to beg for mercy.

545
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,320
They had to plead with me to spare them.

546
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:27,590
I've never heard that you knew martial arts.

547
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:30,250
Right, aren't you a talented scholar?

548
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:32,360
Could it be that you were faking it?

549
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:38,830
I just didn't publicize it before.

550
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:41,920
I grew up in a martial arts school.

551
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:46,270
I guess I'm just an ordinary

552
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:49,860
but well-rounded talent, both in literature and in martial arts.

553
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,180
We can't limit our thinking.

554
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,840
We must broaden our horizons.

555
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:55,540
Very true.

556
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,710
When one person is far superior to another person,

557
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,720
the latter can only look up in admiration.

558
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,280
You...

559
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:03,550
Who are you referring to?

560
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,520
After hearing your story,

561
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,440
I am in deep admiration.

562
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,310
May I have your handwriting?

563
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,410
I'll place it in my ancestral home

564
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:15,510
and burn incense before it every day.

565
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,770
That's not very appropriate.

566
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,220
We should keep a low profile, keep it low-key.

567
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,660
Miss Cheng won't even

568
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,060
do such a small favor?

569
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:29,400
Manyi, didn’t you say this morning

570
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:30,800
that you'd gift me the calligraphy

571
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,030
"Serenity Sustains a Thousand Years,

572
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,150
and the Hidden Spring Dwells in Solitude"?

573
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:34,840
Since our classmate requests it,

574
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,610
why not give it to her first?

575
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:40,910
Sure, why not?

576
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,160
Sure.

577
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:44,320
Not at all!

578
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,590
I don't know how to write.

579
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:00,800
Manyi.

580
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,630
Your hand was injured during the fight yesterday.

581
00:26:03,630 --> 00:26:04,550
I forgot.

582
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:05,440
Injured?

583
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,700
My hand is injured.

584
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,160
What unfortunate timing.

585
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,390
Then I'll write it on behalf of you today.

586
00:26:13,390 --> 00:26:14,650
Would that be alright?

587
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:21,520
Could Wei possibly know

588
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:24,090
that I'm pretending to be a talented scholar?

589
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,410
Well, you...

590
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:36,030
That outfit looks nice on you.

591
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:39,820
This is the academy's standard student uniform.

592
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,940
The same as mine.

593
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:48,010
By the way, your brother...

594
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:51,630
Has he not finished his studies yet?

595
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:55,250
My brother doesn't have class today.

596
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,030
No class? Well, I'll be off then.

597
00:26:58,060 --> 00:26:58,750
Manyi.

598
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:03,170
Are you wondering

599
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:05,360
if I know

600
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:08,600
that you're not actually a talented scholar?

601
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,970
What? Manyi is illiterate?

602
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:15,640
She just doesn't know the Feng State script, that’s all.

603
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:18,190
This is unbelievable.

604
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:19,960
Wei.

605
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,830
If you can't accept it...

606
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:24,630
Manyi is even more extraordinary than I imagined.

607
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,960
Brother, you've truly found a gem.

608
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,210
I'm glad you don't mind.

609
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,990
I have a favor to ask you.

610
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:34,080
You must protect Manyi,

611
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,230
but also ensure that no one realizes anything is amiss

612
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,760
and takes advantage of her.

613
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:53,950
You want to play the qin for me?

614
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:57,110
No, it’s you. You're the one who must play the qin

615
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:59,130
at tomorrow's qin playing meeting.

616
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,370
What?

617
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:01,630
I have to play the qin?

618
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:02,350
Yes.

619
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,020
To ensure that nothing goes wrong, Vice Censor-in-Chief Du

620
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,880
didn't even reveal the location.

621
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,500
This time next year,

622
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:16,010
you can burn more paper offerings for me.

623
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:20,230
But not all hope is lost.

624
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:23,850
Right.

625
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:25,710
I can't play the qin.

626
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,510
But I can run away.

627
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:33,410
This is Cheng Manyi, the World's Greatest Talented Woman.

628
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:36,080
She’s Cheng Manyi?

629
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:38,770
You are now a walking, living signboard.

630
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:40,460
Where can you run to?

631
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:45,780
Could I fake being sick to get out of this?

632
00:28:45,790 --> 00:28:47,320
Delaying won’t work.

633
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:49,840
Vice Censor-in-Chief Du will simply choose another time.

634
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,530
Young Master, Vice Censor-in-Chief Du has sent word that the qin playing meeting

635
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:55,660
will be postponed until after the Young Madam recovers.

636
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:04,330
[Invitation to the Qin Playing Meeting]

637
00:29:01,630 --> 00:29:03,100
The "fake illness" plan

638
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:05,290
is dead.

639
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:28,670
You can cover the windows,

640
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:31,160
but how do you hide from

641
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:33,320
all the Du's Mansion's many servants?

642
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,390
The "blinding" plan

643
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:40,880
is dead too.

644
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:44,320
This won’t work.

645
00:29:44,810 --> 00:29:45,830
That won’t work.

646
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,140
What should I do?

647
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:47,950
This qin playing meeting

648
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:50,030
is clearly aimed at me.

649
00:29:50,590 --> 00:29:51,970
I already have a plan.

650
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:53,500
But for now,

651
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:54,810
you'll need to learn

652
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:56,290
to put on a show

653
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,740
and mimic the motions of playing the qin.

654
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:00,350
What do you mean?

655
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:04,460
Come, sit.

656
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:10,830
The qin has

657
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:15,320
seven strings named Gong, Shang, Jue, Zhi, Yu, Wen, and Wu.

658
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:18,970
The right hand plucks the strings with techniques

659
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:28,340
like plucking, sweeping, hooking, flicking, supporting, breaking, striking, and picking.

660
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,860
Your left hand will press the strings to produce tones.

661
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,150
And the right hand

662
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:35,830
will play the sliding tone.
