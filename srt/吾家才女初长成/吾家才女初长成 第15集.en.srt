00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:16,900
and what you did.

177
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,400
You solved people's problems.

178
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:22,510
Thanks

179
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:24,120
for making the list.

180
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,360
Here they are!

181
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,790
Don't let them go!

182
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:30,580
Calm down.

183
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,920
What happened?

184
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:32,870
They

185
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,520
made contributions to the people

186
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,480
and distinguished right from wrong.

187
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,000
They helped us.

188
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:43,100
Thank you.

189
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:44,530
We come from word of mouth

190
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,940
to seek help to solve our cases.

191
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:48,659
Please help us.

192
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,930
Okay.

193
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:51,690
Okay.

194
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,560
Okay.

195
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:53,320
Time to work.

196
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,300
Time to work.

197
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,430
Let's begin.

198
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:57,000
My farming cow

199
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,680
has been pregnant for 12 months.

200
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,700
But it hasn't given birth to a calf yet.

201
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,180
I lost my cat.

202
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,630
It's been raining for days,

203
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,460
causing the collapse of one of my rooms.

204
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:06,960
My hen is missing.

205
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,850
My husband hasn't been home for three days.

206
00:07:08,850 --> 00:07:09,830
I've written it down.

207
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:10,150
Thank you.

208
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,110
You lost your wife?

209
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:11,630
You lost your bracelet?

210
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:12,270
-Okay.
-Okay.

211
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:13,140
Wait for our news.

212
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:13,810
You lost your pig?

213
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:15,270
I'll find it for you, okay?

214
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,030
Chick.

215
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:17,940
You can't beat your child.

216
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:19,070
What did you lose?

217
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:19,870
Wang Lao'er, my neighbor,

218
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,350
borrowed 20 taels of silver from me

219
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:22,250
but hasn't returned it yet.

220
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:24,170
Come on, look what this is.

221
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,280
Young Master.

222
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,710
What's the matter?

223
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,260
Grand Master Ning invited the Crown Prince to dinner.

224
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:31,380
He invited you to visit his mansion.

225
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,530
Hello.

226
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:34,310
I'll help you.

227
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,520
I will.

228
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,740
Okay.

229
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,220
I'll go.

230
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,400
But don't tell Young Madam about this.

231
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,220
OK.

232
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:44,380
Take care.

233
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,159
Let's go.

234
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:47,570
It's not a punishment from heaven for a rooster to lay eggs.

235
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:49,880
It's because all you have are roosters.

236
00:07:49,909 --> 00:07:50,770
As time passes,

237
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,570
it became a androgyny.

238
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:55,510
Just put some hens in.

239
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:58,280
Your wife became a vampire

240
00:07:58,310 --> 00:08:00,900
and even sucked blood from wood?

241
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,660
I think she has bleeding gums.

242
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:04,950
Bring her to see a doctor.

243
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:08,910
A man has been pregnant for two years but couldn't give birth?

244
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:11,070
It's not a baby

245
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:12,060
but fat.

246
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,020
Lose some weight.

247
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:16,540
What did you lose?

248
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:17,860
In our mountain,

249
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:20,680
there is a Grieving Spirit in a haunted house

250
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,140
called Granny Ghost-face.

251
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,610
At midnight,

252
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,200
there are always creepy cries.

253
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,170
A brave young man

254
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,810
went to the haunted house

255
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,039
and saw Granny Ghost-face.

256
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:35,780
He said she looked like a demon

257
00:08:35,809 --> 00:08:37,270
and could take souls.

258
00:08:37,669 --> 00:08:39,690
He got seriously ill when he came back.

259
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:41,090
It's true.

260
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:41,429
[Case Record]

261
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:45,650
So, everything happened can be explained by science.

262
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:46,880
You learned for nothing.

263
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,830
You can't trust feudal superstition.

264
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:50,160
Let's go and have a look.

265
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:05,360
Mr. Wen,

266
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,720
the fire a few days ago

267
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,160
was dangerous.

268
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,790
If you hadn't

269
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,950
risked your life to save Miss Cheng,

270
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:16,410
she would have died.

271
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:20,020
How is your wife?

272
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,330
Thank you for your concern.

273
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,860
Even if my wife is in danger,

274
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:29,700
I would do my best to protect her

275
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,520
not only on that day

276
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:34,320
but also in the following days.

277
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:37,430
It's easy to avoid natural disasters.

278
00:09:37,430 --> 00:09:38,890
But the manmade disasters

279
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:41,940
are unpredictable.

280
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,660
I heard that Mr. Wen is dissatisfied with

281
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,670
the inspection result given by the City Guard Department.

282
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:49,340
If you have any evidence,

283
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,820
you can give it to me.

284
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,470
I will enforce the law impartially

285
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:53,850
and do my best to catch the murderer.

286
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:56,250
I will do my best

287
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:57,670
to help you.

288
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:01,850
When will His Highness arrive?

289
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,130
His Highness will arrive tomorrow.

290
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:05,000
How about this?

291
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,080
Mr. Wen, stay in my residence today,

292
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:08,790
okay?

293
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,160
Don’t bother, Grand Master Ning.

294
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:15,670
I’ll visit you tomorrow.

295
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:22,990
Send him to the ice cellar.

296
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:26,260
He can't escape this time.

297
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:29,470
Cheng Manyi has won praise from the people many times.

298
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:30,540
The Wen family

299
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,610
is troublesome.

300
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,940
No need to care about them.

301
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,480
Fortunately, Miss Chenwei didn't come.

302
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,410
Come, let's boost our morale.

303
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,160
The Three Heroes of Feng State

304
00:10:58,830 --> 00:10:59,880
are unparalleled

305
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,120
and dominant!

306
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:02,750
Let's go.

307
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,620
Are you looking for me?

308
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:06,670
Wen.

309
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,510
Wen.

310
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:10,140
Wen, are you okay?

311
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:12,800
I overheard the conversation between my father and Grand Master Ning

312
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,000
and found this place.

313
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,440
I know you don't like me.

314
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:18,760
But

315
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:21,120
I will never harm you.

316
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:23,060
Thank you.

317
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,670
Let's go, Wen.

318
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,940
I'll take you out now.

319
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:28,710
Du Yaqin!

320
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,680
Dad.

321
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,630
You silly girl.

322
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,170
Do you think he will fall in love with you

323
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,860
after you save him?

324
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:36,520
Dad,

325
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:37,630
please.

326
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:39,070
Please let him go.

327
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:41,590
If he stays here,

328
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:42,830
he'll be in trouble.

329
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,470
You are so stupid.

330
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,710
If you

331
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,380
are caught by Grand Master Ning,

332
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:50,040
do you know the consequences?

333
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,370
Go with me. Hurry!

334
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,470
Go with me!

335
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:54,130
Dad!

336
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:54,880
Go!

337
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:08,190
Damn it.

338
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,490
If I have a fever,

339
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,420
and become a nine-year-old boy,

340
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,070
I won't be able to control myself.

341
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:19,250
I'm afraid the consequences will be unimaginable.

342
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:29,150
It's delicious.

343
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,170
It smells so good.

344
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:33,230
It tastes better than the roast chicken in the capital.

345
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,190
All these years,

346
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,040
besides my husband,

347
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:40,960
you are the only people who are kind to me.

348
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:41,840
But Miss,

349
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:43,450
I think you're pretty.

350
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,850
Those people are blind.

351
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:46,190
What are you doing?

352
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:47,450
Stay away from my wife!

353
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,940
Stay away from my wife!

354
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:49,920
Honey.

355
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,060
Don't scare them.

356
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,690
They are all good men.

357
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,260
Mr. Wen.

358
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,580
Mr. Wen.

359
00:14:14,290 --> 00:14:15,270
Who are you?

360
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:16,800
Where am I?

361
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,710
It's so cold.

362
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:20,130
Yi, don't be afraid.

363
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,560
Do you know me?

364
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:24,360
No.

365
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:32,900
Don't be afraid.

366
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,950
I'm your father's best friend.

367
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,260
He told me

368
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,640
to get you out of here!

369
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:39,300
Come.

370
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:40,510
Get up.

371
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,830
Why

372
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,810
didn't he come to pick me up?

373
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:46,110
Father told me

374
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:48,130
not to get close to strangers.

375
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:49,630
You're nine years old.

376
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:53,820
Your father is the principal of the World's Greatest Academy.

377
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,550
You befriended a girl named Cheng Manyi.

378
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,010
Am I right?

379
00:14:58,650 --> 00:15:00,720
If that's the case,

380
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:03,450
you are indeed my dad's best friend.

381
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,030
Come on.

382
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,730
She used to be so beautiful.

383
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,470
If it were not the accident

384
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:21,010
that ruined my wife's face,

385
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:22,940
we would have enjoyed a happy life.

386
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:26,350
My family has been practicing medicine for generations.

387
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:28,750
I can cure all illnesses in the mortal world

388
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:31,400
but I can't cure my wife.

389
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,080
I'm useless.

390
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,590
Then why

391
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,290
did you choose to

392
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,120
live in the mountains?

393
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,550
I know

394
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:44,310
you came here because of the rumors.

395
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,980
Sorry for pretending to be a ghost and scaring you.

396
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,170
You're trying to avoid disturbance, right?

397
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:51,130
Due to

398
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,310
my ugly face,

399
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:55,970
I was discriminated in the village.

400
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,430
Some villagers thought I was unlucky.

401
00:15:58,430 --> 00:15:59,000
Thank you.

402
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,840
They often came to make trouble.

403
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,780
My husband had no choice

404
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,210
but

405
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,120
to take me into the mountains

406
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,700
and make up a rumor about Granny Ghost-face

407
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:10,060
to keep strangers away.

408
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,770
If he had abandoned me,

409
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:16,250
I wouldn't have the courage to live in the world.

410
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,120
For my sake,

411
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:20,410
he gave up many things.

412
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:22,290
I'm afraid

413
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:24,920
I won't be able to pay him back forever.

414
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,780
Then we'll stay together forever

415
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,330
as long as you don't hate me.

416
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,770
It's touching.

417
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:33,510
Miss,

418
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:35,550
can I have a try?

419
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,700
Maybe I can help you recover a bit.

420
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,170
I'm old.

421
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,240
Yi,

422
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:49,830
I almost forgot something important.

423
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:52,840
Do you know where the seal is?

424
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,150
Your father will meet His Majesty soon.

425
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:56,410
If he can't take it out,

426
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,040
his life will be in danger.

427
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,640
The seal?

428
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:03,050
There are countless seals in our family.

429
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:04,200
If you don't make it clear,

430
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,740
I don't know which one you want.

431
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,700
The one left by your grandfather.

432
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,069
In that case,

433
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:12,490
I remember it.

434
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,920
OK. OK.

435
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:20,790
Yi,

436
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:23,550
this matter concerns the future of the Wen family.

437
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:24,720
If you remember it,

438
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:27,069
I'll give you

439
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:28,650

00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,560
didn't make it clear.

442
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:34,230
Why do you want the seal?

443
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:35,670
Why will my father be killed

444
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,200
if I do not give you the seal?

445
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,040
If you don't make everything clear,

446
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,000
I won't tell you where it is.

447
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,920
You...

448
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,690
This seal concerns the secret of Feng State.

449
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:49,020
Think about where is it!

450
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,870
You were

451

a kind elder just now

00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,220

I don't know where it is.

what kind of magic is this?

Head-changing technique,

463
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,510
I mean, makeup technique.

464
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:44,280
Makeup?

465
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:48,280
I've taught her how to make up.

466

There are methods to cure over 2000 poisons.

474

A herb called Phoenix Grass can detoxify all poisons.

475
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,680
However, it's rare.

476

It's difficult to get it.

477
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:09,990
It can detoxify all poisons?

It's a capital offense.

You'll also be sentenced to death if you want to cover up him.

552
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:34,940
I don't care.

553
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,190

I can't bear to see you in danger.

560
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,800
I don't want to be a widower.

561

Wen Chenyi,

566
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:27,830
you attempted to assassinate the Crown Prince.

567
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:30,510
Everyone here saw that.

568
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:32,980
What you are holding now is the evidence.

569
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,580
You two should surrender now.

570
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:39,990
I have sugar cream on my hands.

571
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:43,000
There is also sugar cream on the body of the bow.

572
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,520
In that case,

573
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:48,110
this arrow should also be covered with sugar cream.

574
00:24:01,670 --> 00:24:02,620
Your Highness,

575
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,660
there is no sugar cream in the arrow.

576
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,230
Maybe you…

577
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:13,360
You mean, I painted it afterward, huh?

578
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,470
When Grand Master Ning shouted,

everyone saw

580
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:19,380

00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:21,080
I stood there all the time.

582
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,450
As you said,

583
00:24:23,710 --> 00:24:26,530
everyone present can testify for Chenyi.

584
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:29,880
He couldn't shoot an arrow

585
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:32,100
from where he stood.

586
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:34,230

who is behind this.

Grand Master Ning knew the Crown Prince would come here.

600
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,460
But you didn’t send more guards,

causing the assassin to sneak into the mansion

602

Don't squeeze! Don't squeeze!

696
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:57,860
Line up!

697
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,110
Line up.

698
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:06,050
Your method

699
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:08,210
on planning the selling process

700
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:09,690
is novel.

701
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:12,290
This is called hunger marketing.

702
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:15,170
We need to lower the price to arouse enthusiasm

703
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:16,900
and make them willing to pay.

704
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:18,710
Marketing?

705
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:19,740
What does it mean?

706
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,090
It's to make them pay more

707
00:29:22,190 --> 00:29:23,720
but believe they earn a lot.

708
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:24,710
It looks like

709
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:26,670
you're ready to sell out.

710
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:30,550
Manyi, can you stamp it for me?

711
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:31,910
Sure.

712
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:32,930
Thank you.

713
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,480
Next.

714
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:34,820
Manyi, stamp it for me.

715
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:35,260
Here you are.

716
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:35,860
Thank you.

717
00:29:36,530 --> 00:29:37,650
Happy love!

718
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:39,030
Sorry to keep you waiting.

719
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:40,140
Thank you.

720
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,360
Please keep it.

721
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:43,250
Enjoy the romantic story.

722
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:46,070
Manyi, I like you so much.

723
00:29:46,070 --> 00:29:48,730
Thank you. Please continue to support Chenwei.

724
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,400
Not bad.

725
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:54,830
Take it.

726
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,150
Yes, count it.

727
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:10,960
Sorry, madam.

728
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,030
We can only

729
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:14,090
sign on comic books and derivatives.

730
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:16,250
I know.

731
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,560
But Miss Manyi,

732
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:19,990
all the books and comics

733
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:21,060
are sold out.

734
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,160
I have no choice.

735
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,020
I'm waiting for your autograph

736
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,230
to save my boy.

737
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,040
My boy.

738
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:32,670
He admires you very much.

739
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,750
He always said he wanted

740
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:37,830
to be a talented man adept in both pen and sword like you.

741
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,140
But

742
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:41,980
he was hit by a carriage

743
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,310
a month ago

744
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,950
and got a leg disease.

745
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:49,490
My son, a good boy,

746
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:52,750
can never stand up again.

747
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:55,860
Luckily,

748
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:58,290
every day when he was in pain,

749
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:00,900
he listened to your story

750
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:05,340
and got the courage to live.

751
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:07,870
You know,

752
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:09,750
his birthday is coming.

753
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,950
As his mother,

754
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:14,580
I want your autograph

755
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:17,150
to make him happy.

756
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:19,930
Miss Manyi,

757
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:22,260
I won't break the rules of the bookstore.

758
00:31:22,670 --> 00:31:24,410
This is all I have.

759
00:31:24,750 --> 00:31:26,830
I can book your next comic.

760
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:28,730
Please.

761
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,520
Please sign it for me.

762
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,240
Madam.

763
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:34,360
Madam!

764
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:35,660
I can't take the money.

765
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:36,940
I'll sign it for you.

766
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,700
Thank you. Miss Manyi.

767
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:45,610
Wish your son a speedy recovery.

768
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:46,770
Thank you.
