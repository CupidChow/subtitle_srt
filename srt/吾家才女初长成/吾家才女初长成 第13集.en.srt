[Episode 13]

3
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:15,820
Would you like to go out with me?

4
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,140
This is too hard.

5
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:21,240
Manyi,

6
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:24,810
what are you doing?

7
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,700
Meet me at Fuqu Lake around 6 p.m. today.

8
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:35,570
Young Madam isn't possessed, is she?

9
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,270
If you understood the joy in life better,

10
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,130
you wouldn't be still single.

11
00:01:42,289 --> 00:01:44,220
Even Dongqing doesn't talk to you.

12
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,490
Read more books.

13
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:59,229
He will come.

14
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:03,300
He won't.

15
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:06,380
He will.

16
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,000
He won't.

17
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,460
He will.

18
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:13,060
My wife invited me,

19
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,670
how could I not show up?

20
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,370
You made it.

21
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,820
So you asked me to

22
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:20,829
come here

23
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,340
to go boating with you.

24
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:32,750
Let's go.

25
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,260
I found this at the qin playing meeting.

26
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:36,500
Here.

27
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:39,760
Get in there.

28
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,310
Okay.

29
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:43,900
♫The candle is burning out, the dawn is breaking♫

30
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,060
♫The moon knows my thoughts♫

31
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:47,860
Come.

32
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,600
Be careful

33
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:51,270
♫Life is so long; I hope to spend♫

34
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,450
♫The rest of my life with you♫

35
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:52,640
Take a seat.

36
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:54,900
Let me row the boat.

37
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:58,780
♫It's a long way to go♫

38
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:57,650
OK.

39
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:08,430
♫May I have a lifelong partner♫

40
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,250
Lotus leaves and the skirt are of same green.

41
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,250
The flowers are blooming to her face to face.

42
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:13,580
♫Let me be your lover♫

43
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:15,500
Not utill the coming of the girl’s singing,

44
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,700
♫Hope you can get to know my love♫

45
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:20,470
can her presence be felt in the lake.

46
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,640
♫Wait for the arrangement of fate♫

47
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:22,090
Can her…

48
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:23,820
♫Let us be together♫

49
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:24,770
I'd like to sing a song for you.

50
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,170
You can sing?

51
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:28,170
♫It's a long way to go♫

52
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,360
Yes, of course.

53
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:30,090
They call me "the little music library" for a reason.

54
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:29,610
♫But I'll devote my love to you♫

55
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:34,750
You're sitting at the bow of the boat.

56
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,180
I'm sitting at the stern.

57
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:41,780
The towline sways.

58
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:44,770
Our love is strong.

59
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:52,540
Wen Chenyi,

60
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,500
I've been wanting to tell you something

61
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,390
for a long time.

62
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,870
Manyi, the boat...

63
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:02,960
Don't interrupt.

64
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:04,800
Listen to me.

65
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:08,230
I...

66
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,980
I think my feet are wet.

67
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:14,690
The boat is taking in water.

68
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,800
Focus.

69
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:17,779
Listen.

70
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:19,850
Oh, no.

71
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:20,350
Manyi.

72
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,019
This...

73
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:22,180
The boat is leaking.

74
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:22,660
Hurry up!

75
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,030
What?

76
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:23,940
Row back. Hurry!

77
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:24,430
Hurry. Go back.

78
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,420
What should we do?

79
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,300
Go back.

80
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:27,170
Hurry.

81
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:28,190
Here. Let me help.

82
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,140
Here.

83
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,020
Let's sit together.

84
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:31,640
Come on.

85
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:32,870
What should we do?

86
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,540
-Hurry!
-Hurry.

87
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:35,750
My shoes are wet.

88
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:39,010
I messed up.

89
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,750
The confession that I planed carefully

90
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,780
is ruined.

91
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,250
Don't cry.

92
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,060
Manyi,

93
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,940
there will be other chances.

94
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:55,110
No, there will not.

95
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:59,140
Because of me, your brother almost got sick this time.

96
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:02,230
He must be traumatized.

97
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:05,960
There must be

98
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,540
another way.

99
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:11,900
By the way,

100
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:14,840
tomorrow is the Mid-Autumn Festival.

101
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:17,670
It's such a memorable festival.

102
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:20,880
It suits the sense of ritual

103
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,550
that you mentioned.

104
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,420
Wei.

105
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,730
I have several sophisticated plans

106
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,740
that I need your help to carry out.

107
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,270
The Moon Worshipping Ceremony

108
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,390
begins.

109
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:37,120
Cleanse the hands.

110
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:55,430
Offer the incense.

111
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,500
Offer the libation.

112
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:18,530
Today we celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival.

113
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:21,580
It is a wonderful holiday.

114
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,350
The mission of the World's Greatest Academy

115
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:28,150
is to cultivate the pillar of the nation.

116
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,470
We are learning

117
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:31,380
to set examples for others.

118
00:06:31,410 --> 00:06:32,730
I hope you all

119
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,430
will be honest,

120
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,200
righteous,

121
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,320
and responsible.

122
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,610
Yes.

123
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:43,180
Thank you for your advice.

124
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:44,840
Let us

125
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:47,240
take this opportunity

126
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:48,710
to enjoy the moon and have a great time.

127
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:51,390
Enjoy poetry and wine while you're still young.

128
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:52,670
Okay.

129
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,260
Come.

130
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,800
Drink with me.

131
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,850
Son,

132
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,750
come with me.

133
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:03,830
Let's go.

134
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,340
Is everyone ready?

135
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:06,810
Yes.

136
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,790
Attention, everyone.

137
00:07:07,790 --> 00:07:08,560
This is not a rehearsal.

138
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,230
I repeat.

139
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,410
This is not a rehearsal.

140
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:11,670
Lighting technicians, props masters, set designers, extras.

141
00:07:11,670 --> 00:07:12,630
Get ready and steady.

142
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,830
Let's make it happen in one take.

143
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:14,390
Go.

144
00:07:18,590 --> 00:07:20,730
This is the proposal I carefully prepared.

145
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,200
Mooncake that contains my love.

146
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,910
This method is evolved from hiding the ring in the cake.

147
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:26,710
When Wen Chenyi eats the mooncake,

148
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:28,710
he will accidentally bite the ring.

149
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,260
It will be a small surprise

150
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,400
that melts his heart.

151
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,890
It will go so smoothly.

152
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,409
Try this mooncake.

153
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,100
Wen Chenyi,

154
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,430
let's stay together forever.

155
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:59,270
Okay?

156
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,180
Okay.

157
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,820
Oh my gosh.

158
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:17,270
Darling.

159
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:18,130
Darling.

160
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,320
Try this mooncake.

161
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:26,210
Try another.

162
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:29,470
Try another.

163
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:33,780
Try another.

164
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,070
One more.

165
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:36,299
I'll let you eat.

166
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:39,440
Mr. Wen doesn't want to eat them.

167
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,909
Why are you forcing him anyway?

168
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:41,620
Manyi,

169
00:08:41,650 --> 00:08:43,640
I'll eat them since he doesn't want to.

170
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,470
Delicious.

171
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:45,510
Sweet.

172
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,340
Fortunately, I have a backup plan.

173
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,120
The second show of my confession.

174
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,470
I'll confess my love publicly

175
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:06,770
at the end of the show.

176
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:07,590
I might be accused of moral coercion

177
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:08,820
because of this.

178
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:11,030
And if I fail, it will be social suicide for me.

179
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,300
But I don't have much time now.

180
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,900
I'll have to take risks.

181
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:38,950
I want to have a relationship

182
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,870
that lasts forever with you.

183
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:17,050
Get ready.

184
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,160
What's wrong?

185
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,100
Get up.

186
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:39,250
Get up now.

187
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:39,660
You...

188
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,060
Hurry.

189
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:40,690
Come back.

190
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,930
Run.

191
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,730
Hurry.

192
00:10:45,570 --> 00:10:47,350
[Break up
I don't want to have a relationship with you.]

193
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:49,160
Manyi,

194
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,260
you finally did the right thing.

195
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,010
Break up.

196
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,500
I don't want to have a relationship with you.

197
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,920
That's enough.

198
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,960
I'm going to make a very direct move.

199
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:03,670
Wen Chenyi.

200
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,840
The Grand Master is here.

201
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,400
Greetings, Grand Master.

202
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:26,860
Greetings, Grand Master.

203
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:29,800
Grand Master Ning.

204
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,790
Sorry I didn't wait for you by the gate.

205
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:31,690
Please forgive me.

206
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,700
There's no need to follow the formalities.

207
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,140
I came here today

208
00:11:35,150 --> 00:11:37,090
to celebrate

209
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,660
this holiday with you, the talents of the country.

210
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:40,300
Also,

211
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,930
I want to play chess

212
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,220
with you, Mr. Wen,

213
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,800
to scratch the itch.

214
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:45,900
What do you think,

215
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,150
Mr.Wen?

216
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,490
Since you're so interested, Grand Master,

217
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:50,240
I wouldn't dare to

218
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,170
say no.

219
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,110
Great.

220
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,010
Let's be clear.

221
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:56,240
You can't let me win on purpose.

222
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,630
Grand Master.

223
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:59,340
You first.

224
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,550
You're talented

225
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:13,810
and very knowledgeable.

226
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:15,940
But you didn't inherit

227
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:18,290
your chess skills from your family.

228
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,870
Grand Master Ning,

229
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:21,150
so you've played chess

230
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,020
with my father?

231
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,070
No.

232
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,990
I played with your grandfather,

233
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,300
Wenxian.

234
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,180
So you

235
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,230
and my family

236
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,140
go way back, Grand Master.

237
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:39,910
Your grandfather and I were both imperial officials.

238
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:41,440
We were very close friends.

239
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,280
Later,

240
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,760
he resigned from his job

241
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,630
and went on to built this,

242
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:48,090
the World's Best Academy.

243
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:49,970
Why?

244
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,050
You didn't know that?

245
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,230
I wasn't even born

246
00:12:56,430 --> 00:12:58,160
when Grandfather passed away.

247
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,890
so I don't know much about the past.

248
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:02,850
I only know

249
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,580
that I should uphold the will of my ancestors

250
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:06,910
and improve

251
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,870
the academy.

252
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,270
Young Mr. Wen,

253
00:13:12,810 --> 00:13:14,670
look carefully.

254
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:18,920
Small ogeima.

255
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:25,600
Large knight's move.

256
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:29,010
Grand Master Ning is good and steady.

257
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,060
In the first half of the game,

258
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,850
Mr. Wen almost couldn't handle it.

259
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:32,410
Mr. Wen

260
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,890
is quick and smart.

261
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:36,100
Now, he's seizing the opportunity to win

262
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,900
and is about to turn the tide.

263
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:42,460
The old crow is riding on Grand Master Ning's coattails.

264
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,570
They're messing with our Yi.

265
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,220
If you don't stop,

266
00:13:46,270 --> 00:13:48,850
I'll blow your brains out.

267
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:05,750
It seems that I'm going to catch a big fish.

268
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:55,620
What are you looking for?

269
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,480
Do you need

270
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,340
any help?

271
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,840
You little theif.

272
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:11,150
I didn't hit you hard enough

273
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:12,430
when I threw the smoke shell?

274
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:13,890
It's a fireball this time.

275
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:16,540
Stop!

276
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,360
[A Talented Girl Grows Up]

277
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,630
You're calm in a crisis.

278
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,050
You're an impressive young man.

279
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,100
You're too kind, Grand Master.

280
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,170
Bad news. Bad news.

281
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:33,750
Bad news.

282
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:34,800
The secret chamber is on fire.

283
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,630

284
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:37,200

Hurry!

287

The guards

288
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,480
must have succeeded.

289
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,350
Let's go back.

290
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:51,350

It's okay.

I'm fine.

347
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:04,030
Look at me. I'm totally fine, am I?

348
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:06,400
If I see that thief again,

349
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,680
I'm definitely going to break his arms and legs.

350
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:11,750
That thief

351
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,620
is just a pawn.

352
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,010
If my guess is right,

353
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:18,800
the person behind it

354
00:18:19,690 --> 00:18:20,810
has shown himself.

355
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:23,250
Grand Master Ning.

356
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,270
Useless.

357
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:26,390
I… I…

358
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,680
I know I made a mistake.

359
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,280
Please give me another chance.

360
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,760
Is this how you atone for your crimes?

361
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:33,710
My Lord. My Lord.

362
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,330
I really know I made a mistake.

363
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:37,040
Please give me another chance.

364
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:38,120
Please, My Lord.

365
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,430
Fool.

366
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:41,810
I don't want to see you.

367
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:42,670
Get out.

368
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,430
Yes. Yes. Yes.

369
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,810
How did you know it was him?

370
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:50,040
I found Vice Censor-in-Chief Du

371
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,570
shady long ago.

372
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,130
That is the first clue.

373
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,870
Grand Master Ning pretending to be calm

374
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:59,660
when the academy caught fire is the second.

375
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,410
And last,

376
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,440
when I was chatting with Grand Master Ning,

377
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,820
he always casually asked me

378
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,310
about my

379
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:10,720
grandfather.

380
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:11,910
Your grandfather?

381
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:15,070
We'll talk about this later.

382
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:18,090
Do you

383
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,980
have something

384
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:20,960
to tell me today?

385
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:24,250
Did he know my confession plan?

386
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,670
Should I tell him now?

387
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:31,440
Thank you, Heroin Cheng.

388
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,640
Today,

389
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,960
you risked your life to protect the seal of the academy.

390
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,770
But let me tell you something.

391
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,600
No matter how precious that seal is,

392
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:43,110
it's not worth one millionth of you.

393
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:44,550
From now on,

394
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,410
don't put yourself in danger

395
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:47,380
for it.

396
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:54,550
And...

397
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,460
And...

398
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,770
Let me say it.

399
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:05,670
Wen Chenyi.

400
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:09,750
Actually, I…

401
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:12,720
Leave the confession

402
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:14,490
to me.

403
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,120
You said

404
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:30,490
this is called a movie.

405
00:20:30,670 --> 00:20:31,870
It can record

406
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,440
beautiful moments in life.

407
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:41,060
That day,

408
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:42,910
you were like a beam of light

409
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,350
coming down from the sky

410
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:45,670
and entering my life.

411
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:48,170
It was nearing sunset.

412
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:50,390
You looked so pretty in the red gown.

413
00:20:50,790 --> 00:20:51,880
Having met you

414
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,380
is the most beautiful thing

415
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,490
♫The candle is burning out The dawn is breaking♫

416
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:55,510
that has happened in my life.

417
00:20:56,740 --> 00:20:59,530
♫The moon knows my thoughts♫

418
00:20:59,870 --> 00:21:01,630
I've always longed

419
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:03,840
♫Life is so long, I hope to spend♫

420
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,300
for my life partner

421
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,990
to pursue the same thing as I do.

422
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:07,120
♫The rest of my life with you♫

423
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,590
But I didn't expect

424
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,260
♫It's a long way to go♫

425

426
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,590
My rational mind told me to stay away from you,

427
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:20,920
♫May I have a lifelong partner♫

428
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:12,980
but my feelings

429
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,870
led me in the opposite direction.

430
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:17,710
So what if you're illiterate?

431
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,420
You've been through both good

432
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:22,430
and bad times with me.

433

♫I want to be with you forever♫

and do things I don't understand.

446

♫It's okay to be a little late♫

524
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:08,380
Don't worry. Submit to me.

525
00:25:09,430 --> 00:25:11,250
I will be gentle.

526
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:17,190
And just like that,

527
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:18,860
we got closer

528
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:21,800
and closer, gradually,

529
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:24,590
until there was no distance between us.

530
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:28,770
And then?

531
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,300
And then we went to bed.

532
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:31,840
Manyi,

533
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:32,710
please

534
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:34,210
give me more details.

535
00:25:34,990 --> 00:25:35,950
I plan to use them

536
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:37,860
for my next comic book.

537
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:39,410
I've even thought of a title.

538
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:40,490
It's called

539
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:44,010
Bossy wife and her lovestruck husband.

540
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,190
You're good.

541
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:47,870
It sounds like a bestseller.

542
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:49,690
Let's print 200 copies to start.

543
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:51,220
Manyi,

544
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,710
don't change the subject.

545
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,470
Are you going to tell me or not?

546
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,630
Just use your imagination. It will be a lot more fun.

547
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:57,190
Oh, yeah?

548
00:25:58,010 --> 00:25:58,900
Yeah.

549
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,910
Go to bed now. You can find anything in your dream.

550
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:01,880
No, Manyi.

551
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:04,050
Something's off.

552
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:05,860
Why? What's off?

553
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:08,890
If you really were so close with my brother,

554
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,490
why are you in my room now?

555
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:15,860
Aren't you supposed to be sitting on his lap,

556
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,930
looking cute and pretty?

557
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:22,050
Kids these days are so hard to fool.

558
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:23,960
Is my brother...

559
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:24,990
Stop right there.

560
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:27,670
It has nothing to do with your brother.

561
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:30,030
Don't worry. I'll be gentle.

562
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:36,370
What are you doing?

563
00:26:36,370 --> 00:26:36,690
What are you doing?

564
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:37,840
Luckily, we made it in time.

565
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:38,480
Manyi,

566
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:39,780
Yi is injured.

567
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:41,670
So he shouldn't overwork himself.

568
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:44,510
Right. According to the almanac,
it is better not to do anything today.

569
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:46,640
So, you two can't sleep in the same bed.

570
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:49,020
In the same bed?

571
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:50,740
They shouldn't even be in the same room.

572
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:51,940
Your mother is right.

573
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:52,860
Manyi,

574
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,330
you can stay in Chenwei's room for a few days,

575
00:26:54,330 --> 00:26:55,660
until Yi's wound heals.

576
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,090
Honey.

577
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,080
Darling.

578
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,290
Darn it. I was so close.

579
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:05,030
Manyi,

580
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:06,470
are you okay?

581
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:08,030
I'm fine.

582
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:11,630
I just think we don't need to

583
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,320
finish everything in one day.

584
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,960
We have plenty of time.

585
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:19,320
Manyi, you are so romantic.

586
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:20,750
I need to write that down.

587
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,680
You and my brother

588
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:25,680
have given me so much material for my comic book.

589
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:30,200
That book is probably

590
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:32,810
a girls' comic.

591
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:41,040
The two main characters hated each other at first.

592
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,240
Later, they fell in love.

593
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:47,550
Although there were misunderstandings,

594
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:50,410
they worked things out and stayed in love in the end.

595
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,170
Do you think

596
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:55,100
your brother and I are a perfect match?

597
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,710
I can go see Wen Chenyi now.

598
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,140
Honey.

599
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,370
Ah.

600
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,680
Open your mouth. Let me feed you, darling.

601
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,600
Let me do it.

602
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:19,750
Ah.

603
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:21,640
I'll only eat after you've eaten.

604
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,390
Sweet and crispy.

605
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:33,270
It tastes like love.

606
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,170
You work so hard as a teacher.

607
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:51,440
You should eat it.

608
00:28:52,870 --> 00:28:54,960
You practice martial arts so hard every day.

609
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,970
You should eat first.

610
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:58,150
How about this?

611
00:28:58,350 --> 00:28:59,750
We eat it together.

612
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:03,150
That's a great idea.

613
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:12,360
-Yong Master.
-My lady.

614
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:14,940
-Sorry about that.
-Sorry.

615
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,080
What are you doing?
