that one should never display joy or anger on the face

00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:49,110
or for myself.

342
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,610
My lady, you're speaking nonsense again.

343
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:01,190
Are you okay?

344
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,110
I'm fine.

345
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,960
Thank you for saving me, sister-in-law.

346
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,050
It was nothing.

347
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,310
You addressed me as "sister-in-law"?

348
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:15,020
My name is Wen Chenwei.

349
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,800
Wen Chenyi is my older brother.

350
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:20,190
Hello, Wei.

351
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,589
Do you need me to pick up your painting?

352
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:27,930
No need, Manyi.

353
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,900
It's just a piece of waste paper.

354
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,920
That Wen Chenyi

355
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:36,950
literally has such a cute sister.

356
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:38,080
Unbelievable.

357
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:39,500
My brother is fortunate enough

358
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,070
to have such

359
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,730
a kind and warm-hearted wife.

360
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,310
Young Madam! Young Lady!

361
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:48,670
It's time.

362
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:50,390
The new bride should go meet her parents-in-law.

363
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:51,430
What?

364
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:52,890
Meet the parents-in-law!

365
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,070
Yi,

366
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:02,090
being able to marry someone

367
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,790
as talented and beautiful as Manyi

368
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,790
is also a blessing to our Wen family.

369
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:08,060
From now on, we're family.

370
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:11,820
I hope you and Yi can treat each other with respect

371
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:13,100
and live in harmony.

372
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,590
Also,

373
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:16,200
I'm afraid I'll have to trouble you

374
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,460
to take care of Yi's health in the future.

375
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:21,090
New bride, serve tea to your in-laws.

376
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,890
Fortunately, everything is alright.

377
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,070
Manyi, you're good.

378
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:45,420
I'm not

379
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:49,200
the World's Greatest Talented Woman at all.

380
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:58,380
Dealing with Wen Chenyi alone is already difficult enough,

381
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,380
and now I've offended the whole family.

382
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,220
The opponents are too strong.

383
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:02,220
I have to sneak away.

384
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,030
My lady, you can't go.

385
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:06,470
You can only stay alive if you remain in Wen's Mansion.

386
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:07,470
Dongqing,

387
00:19:07,470 --> 00:19:09,390
you're way too naive.

388
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,280
Stay alive?

389
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:12,970
Staying here may actually get me killed faster.

390
00:19:14,470 --> 00:19:15,470
Young Madam.

391
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,650
I'm Jiaobai.

392
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,490
I am the Young Master's personal attendant.

393
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:22,080
Now that you've married into the Wen family,

394
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:22,540
then...

395
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,150
then...

396
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,450
there's a huge secret

397
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,970
that I must share with you.

398
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:29,560
In the future, you might...

399
00:19:31,610 --> 00:19:32,810
perhaps...

400
00:19:33,970 --> 00:19:35,290
maybe...

401
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:38,080
notice that the Young Master occasionally displays peculiar behavior,

402
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,220
almost as if he...

403
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:42,520
transforms.

404
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,550
Transforms.

405
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,980
But please don't be frightened.

406
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,970
Because our Young Master...

407
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:50,640
He...

408
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:51,550
He what?

409
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:52,810
Could it be...

410
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:54,590
that he has a hidden illness?

411
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,630
I've known it for a long time.

412
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,160
You've known it for a long time?

413
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,320
Of course, I did.

414
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,940
Okay, I got it. You may leave.

415
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:06,290
Then, I'll take my leave.

416
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:14,080
My lady, what exactly do you know?

417
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,110
Dongqing,

418
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:18,210
you're so naive.

419
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:20,770
Isn't it obvious?

420
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,390
Wen Chenyi

421
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:25,640
is a completely twisted, sick, and two-faced man.

422
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,790
Based on all my experiences with dramas,

423
00:20:27,790 --> 00:20:29,510
with such a husband,

424
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,860
I might end up like this.

425
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:35,230
Hero, I still have heroic deeds to accomplish.

426
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:37,230
Please let me go.

427
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:43,030
Honey, you keep talking about doing heroic deeds,

428
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:45,960
yet you won't even do this small favor of marrying me?

429
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:48,720
That makes so much sense,

430
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,970
and I can't even argue with it.

431

[Plea for Mercy Plan; Failed]

432
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:55,180
Once, there was a genuine love

433
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:56,570
placed right before me.

434
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,110
I didn't cherish it.

435
00:20:58,670 --> 00:21:00,200
Only when I lost it

436
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:01,490
did I regret it deeply.

437
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,760
There's nothing more painful in this world than that.

Don't hesitate any longer.

441
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,850
If God could give me another chance

442
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:15,110
to do it all again,

443
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,540
I would say three words to that girl:

444
00:21:19,130 --> 00:21:20,240
I love you.

445
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,930

or "sick and two-faced"?

450
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:39,610
My lady, are you possessed or going crazy again?

451
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,060
No.

452
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:43,990
I have to find a way to go back.

453
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:47,020
But how can I go back?

454
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,470
The coffin.

455
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:55,190
As late autumn passes, all flowers wither and fade.

456
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:58,180
Only the Three Friends of Winter—pine, plum, and bamboo—

457
00:21:58,180 --> 00:21:59,730
stand tall and proud.

458
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,420
But I wonder:

459
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:05,270
if heavy snow suddenly falls,

460
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:07,950
will the pine

461
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,870
remain evergreen and ageless?

462
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,250
Will the plum

463
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,140
maintain its exceptional grace?

464
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:15,770
And will the bamboo

465
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:18,900
bend yet remain unyielding?

466
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,820
Vice Censor-in-Chief Du, I'm sorry for not welcoming you sooner.

Please forgive me.

Wen,

you are the principal of the World's Greatest Academy.

470
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:31,550
Though I serve as a court official,

471
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:33,820
within the academy, I am merely a superintendent.

472
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:36,550
There's no need for such formalities between us.

473

I have yet to congratulate Scholar Wen...

Thank you, Vice Censor-in-Chief Du.

476
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,670
May I ask the purpose of your visit today?

477
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,810
To deliver His Majesty's oral edict.

478
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,630
In three months, a delegation of scholar-officials

479
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,780
from Sangyi will visit our country.

480
00:22:56,810 --> 00:23:00,570
At that time, Scholar Wen and his wife, Cheng Manyi,
will meet with His Majesty

481
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:02,770
and lead the top scholars of the academy

482

in a literary debate against them.

483

This concerns the honor of our country.

484
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,950
His Majesty has strictly ordered:

485
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:11,230
we must win; failure is not an option.

486
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:13,500
I accept the decree.

487
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,300

488
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,880
I hope you achieve a great victory.

It's not easy to come here.

496
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,080
I've got to leave something behind.

Could it be that I didn't do it right?

504
00:24:35,750 --> 00:24:37,040
Could it be

505

that the Master was right about Manyi?

I'm afraid...

511
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,640
Master,

512
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:57,970
please be kind and save my daughter.

513
00:24:57,990 --> 00:24:59,340
I'm willing to sell everything I own,

514
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:02,230
even to sacrifice myself to the heavens if necessary!

515
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:05,330
How touching...

516
00:25:12,530 --> 00:25:14,920
In that faraway place...

517
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:16,910
The Wen family...

518
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:20,960
The Wen family is a source of spiritual energy and vitality.

519
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:23,270
Only by staying there

520
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,050
can your daughter

521
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,880
stay alive

522
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:29,440
and have her soul restored.

523
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:32,000
Please follow my instructions.

524
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:34,870
Thank you, Master.

525
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:38,820
Evil spirits...

526
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:39,580
Devour them.

527
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,560
Devour.

528
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:48,350
Manyi.

529
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:51,350
Don't blame me for being so cruel.

530
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,550
I'm doing this for your own good.

531
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,630
Cruel?

532
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,260
Uncle.

533
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:01,880
Manyi,

534
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:02,940
you're back.

535
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:04,960
Who's there?

536
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:10,120
[I was here]

537
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:13,710
These... these are both handwritten by the Young Madam herself?

538
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:15,170
Why are they so different?

539
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:18,490
Are you certain about the news

540
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,850
that she's gone mad due to demonic possession?

541
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:22,060
It's insider information. Absolutely reliable.

542
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,110
Right now, only we and the Cheng family know about it.

543
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:28,310
The World's Greatest Talented Woman has gone crazy after getting married.

544
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,220
All the strange events in the world

545
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:32,750
have happened to her.

546
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:34,250
If she really has been possessed and gone mad,

547
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:35,600
what should we do when we meet His Majesty

548
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,860
and compete in the talent competition against Sangyi in three months?

549
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:40,410
Young Master, our Wen family will be in big trouble.

550
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:41,990
You have a disease, and she has one as well.

551
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:42,910
When two diseases collide,

552
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:44,710
w-w-we are doomed.

553
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:52,180
Though her personality has changed and she speaks oddly,

554
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:54,020
I don't believe she's gone mad.

555
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,320
She's very smart.

556
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,560
Let me test her out,

557
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:58,570
and then we can plan accordingly.

558
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,410
Old Cheng is really ruthless.

559
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:06,760
Superstitions can be really harmful.

560
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,560
Why is it that when others time travel to the past,

561
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,880
they gain all sorts of cheating powers

562
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:10,810
and enjoy their new life,

563
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:11,800
but when it comes to me,

564
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,060
I'm this unlucky?

565
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:14,860
No.

566
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,600
I have to find a way to go back.

567
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,340
Falling from a high place?

568
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,120
Honey,

569
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:24,160
do you recognize this piece of calligraphy?

570
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,760
What kind of scribble is this?

571
00:27:28,270 --> 00:27:29,470
What does it even say?

572
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:31,130
How could she be illiterate?

573
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,460
Is there anything else?

574
00:27:33,570 --> 00:27:34,700
If not, I'm leaving.

575
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:40,830
Then don't blame me for...

576
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:42,980
clearing the obstacles.

577
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,240
My apologies; I was reckless

578
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,580
and collided with you, Young Madam.

579
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:56,030
It's okay.

580
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:57,550
Earlier, I was rushing over,

581
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,070
and I spotted a big goose in the sky.

582
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,220
It was so beautiful.

583
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,100
So I paused to admire it for a moment,

584
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,860
and in that moment of distraction, I...

585
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:04,580
Is it all right?

586
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,460
Yes.

587

[The World's Greatest Talented Woman]

588
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:09,830
Watch out!

589
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,180
So, it's that ancient painting.

590
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,410
Let me ask you, Jiaobai.

591
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:21,190
Where can I buy ancient paintings?

592
00:28:21,190 --> 00:28:24,190
Young Madam, why would you need to buy them?

593
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:27,070
In all of Feng State, no one has a larger collection of ancient paintings

594
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:28,390
than our Young Master.

595
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,290
They're all just ordinary paintings.

596
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,700
They're not what I'm looking for at all.

597
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:07,700
Young Master.

598
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:21,950
Sunlight streaming onto the incense burner kindles violet smoke...

599

[The Book of Songs]

600
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:25,340
Li Bai came to the roasted duck restaurant.

601
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:27,690
Could it be that she...

602
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,180
is really illiterate?

603
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:32,380
I'm tired.

604
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,790
I'm going to take a break.

605
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:34,820
Not so fast.

606
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,700
Why don't you and I discuss the literature further?

607
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:40,010
This Wen Chenyi

608
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:41,740
is testing me like crazy.

609
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,980
What should I do? What should I do?

610
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:46,110
Right, I should roll with the punches.

611
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,700
All right.

612
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:48,790
I can't keep up the act anymore.

613
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:49,390
I confess.

614
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:52,300
I was seriously ill,

615
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:55,120
and afterward, I tragically lost my memory.

616
00:29:55,150 --> 00:29:56,830
So, now, I am

617
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:58,870
not the "Cheng Manyi" you used to know.

618

a new me.

Didn't you say that you wanted a divorce?

621
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:13,590
Let's get on with it.

622
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:15,990
I won't hold you back from finding new love.

623
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,430
Just what I wanted.

I think I know this character.

It's... "Letter."

628

Isn't this a divorce letter? I'll sign it.

629

There is nothing between us anymore.

632
00:31:07,050 --> 00:31:08,320
This is a...

633
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:12,020
letter... of... commitment.

634
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,750
You illiterate.

635
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:16,620
Commitment letter? What commitment letter?

636
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:18,840
Did you just call me illiterate?

637
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,890
I just can't read your script here.

638
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,540
Is that illegal?

639
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:23,220
Deceiving the Emperor is against the law.

640
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,170
Your title as the World's Greatest Talented Woman

641
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:27,230
was bestowed upon you by His Majesty.

642
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:29,840
If you're found unworthy of the title...

643
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:31,680
What?

644
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:33,370
According to the laws of Feng,

00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:36,630

face execution.

649

face execution.

651
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:52,750
To be a scholar is to be at the pinnacle of society.

652
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:55,380
If you don't study hard, you'll end up like her.

653
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:57,340
You can't even write your own name.

654
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:59,050
Die, illiterate!

655
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:00,910
No, no!

656
00:32:01,550 --> 00:32:03,390
No, I can't die!

657

my heroism award ceremony

659
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,640
will become a memorial service.

660
