-Young Master.
-My lady.

00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,240
I'm sorry.

5
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:19,190
What are you doing?

6
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:20,070
Madam's orders.

7
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:21,190
Young Master needs to focus on healing.

8
00:01:21,190 --> 00:01:23,850
My lady, please bear with it and go back quickly.

9
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:25,570
Honey.

10
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,610
Honey.

11
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:28,270
Hurry up, haven't you had enough during the day?

12
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:31,050
Being too lovey-dovey to the point that it affects the plants wouldn't be good. My lady.

13
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,650
Honey, then let's meet again tomorrow.

14
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,680
Honey.

15
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,700
I'll wait for you tomorrow morning.

[Wen's Mansion]

Wen Chenyi.

18
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:58,360
With a face like a lotus and brows like a painting;

19
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:01,180
Surpassing countless immortals in heaven.

20
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,530
Today, he is so handsome that it's infuriating.

21
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,190
I shouldn't let my saliva drip

22
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:07,740
and ruin the mood.

23
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:26,890
Today, you...

24
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,280
I woke up late today.

25
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,520
I didn't have time to groom and dress up.

26
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:33,490
This is

27
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,010
my first date since leaving single life.

28
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,070
His first impression of me depends on you, Wei.

29
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,510
Don't worry, Manyi. I've noted it all down.

30
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:43,250
It needs to be bright, yet clear.

31
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,710
It must be careful, but not deliberate.

32
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,390
It should give a feeling of

33
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:50,329
being natural even without makeup.

34
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:51,150
In short,

35
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:53,070
the “Straight Guy Killer” look.

36
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,670
Does it look sloppy?

37
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,300
Even without dressing up,

38
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,360
you are beautiful.

39
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,430
Your outfit...

40
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,500
I think the same as you.

41
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,920
Great minds think alike.

42
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,060
It's just a casual outfit.

43
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,060
Young Master.

44
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:09,520
How about this dark-colored long robe?

45
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,120
It makes you look noble and steady.

46
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:12,990
Old-fashioned.

47
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:15,170
How about this lake-blue brocade robe with cloud trim?

48
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:15,900
Too clichéd.

49
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,780
The blue cloud-patterned long robe.

50
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,190
So today

51
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,420
is our two-person world.

52
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,660
Let's start our sweet love.

53
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:34,950
Master, please.

54
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,620
Honey, you are so considerate.

55
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,110
It was just a casual preparation.

56
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,190
Attention, everyone.

57
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,690
Attention, everyone.

58
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:55,880
Especially focus on the details, details.

Dongqing, Jiaobai.

60
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:59,970
You need to put your emotions into the performance.

61
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,630
The emotions need to be sincere.

62
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:02,060
Understand?

63
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:02,490
Okay.

64
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:05,920
Brothers and sisters, the fruit needs to be arranged.

65

Follow the sheet music I gave you.

68
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,860
Listen to my direction. Pay attention to the atmosphere.

69

Boss.

70
00:04:16,209 --> 00:04:18,880
The audience tomorrow must be even numbers.

71
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:21,310
They should be in pairs, so there will be...

72
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,750
A feeling of love.

73
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:23,420
No problem.

74
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:23,940
Okay.

75
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,800
Everyone, get moving.

76
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:27,720

Preparing "The Legend of the White Snake" is definitely correct.

It's a perfect date plan.

82

Great!

You're awake.

86

The play is over?

87
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:45,550
The play was full of twists and turns, deeply moving.

88
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:47,480
I'm savoring it.

89
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:51,370
I've known “The Legend of the White Snake” since I was little.

90
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:53,120
I fell asleep because of that.

91
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:53,950
It's alright.

92
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:55,850
Sometimes,

93
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,670
What you do is not important.

94
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:59,520
What matters is the thought behind it.

95
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,870
The most important thing

96
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:01,670
Is having you.

97
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,430
Has anyone ever said you're good at sweet talk?

Yes.

Who?

100

You just said so.

Alright.

102
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,030
Next, just wait for the surprise

I've prepared for you.

Are you taking me to the mountain to enjoy the scenery?

Don't be impatient.

106

Look over there, Honey.

107

Slow down, Honey.

108

What's this?

109
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:34,750
Why...

110
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,050
Don't you take a guess?

111
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,940
You didn't

112
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,060
prepare 999 roses, did you?

113
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,310
You like that?

114
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,010
Well.

115
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,020
That means I had a wrong guess.

116
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,409
Try guessing again.

117
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,010
Will you tell me or not?

118
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:53,310
If you don't, I'll just leave.

119
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:58,290
Honey, look.

120
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,960
Did you make this yourself?

121
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:07,000
How are you so talented?

122
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,150
Do you have any other surprise skills

123
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:09,410
I don't know about?

124
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,770
It's just a wooden kite.

125

Get ready.

One, two, three.

136
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,790
It's my fault for planning this date.

137
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,760
I fell asleep during the play, and it started off badly.

138
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:53,560
I completely ruined the mood.

139
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:56,090
He wouldn't regret agreeing to this, would he?

140
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:57,840
If only my plan had been more thorough,

141
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,740
I wouldn't have ruined our first date.

142
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,170
It's all my fault. She must be angry with me.

143
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:08,340
Look at him. His eyes were so angry they seemed ready to devour me.

144
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,400
She indeed complains through her eyes.

145

Jiaobai, stop the carriage.

146

Are you okay?

147

I'm fine.

148
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:17,590
Not really.

149
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,300
I need to get out and clear my mind.

150

I also have a few things to take care of.

Alright.

It's raining outside. Take an umbrella.

154

No, I have to make it up.

155

No, I have to make it up.

156

Finally, there's a date,

157

and it's raining.

158

Heaven truly shows no mercy.

159
00:08:46,610 --> 00:08:48,460
What should I give him?

160
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:49,680
This one looks really nice.

161
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,680
I will give him...

162
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:51,940
Right?

163

Boss,

168
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,760
I'd like to choose a gift for my husband.

Do you have anything suitable?

170
00:09:07,030 --> 00:09:08,330
Look at these mandarin ducks.

00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:49,190
for the academy fire are out.

516
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:57,330
This operation really made me laugh.

517
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,430
The black-clad man started the fire right in front of me.

518
00:24:59,430 --> 00:25:01,110
And you're telling me it was an accident?

519
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:02,510
Can it be any more absurd?

520
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:04,240
This is the final verdict.

521
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,780
If you have objections, you may go to the government office

522
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,270
and appeal to the Imperial Censor.

523
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:09,940
You have failed to act for so many times.

524
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:12,250
Do you live up to this sacred profession?

525
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:14,420
Where is the public servant's sense of duty?

526
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,150
Farewell, no need to see us off.

527
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,340
Stop right there!

528
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:17,740
Honey.

529
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,970
I'm going to the Imperial Censor

530
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,790
to appeal.

531
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:28,890
Who is it?

532
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:32,300
It's almost time to close the court, and you're still here beating the drum?

533
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:33,100
Sirs,

534
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:34,360
I need to appeal to the Imperial Censor.

535
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:36,910
The Imperial Censor stayed overnight at the brothel last night.

536
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,290
Go look there.

537
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:43,420
Isn't this Mr. Wen and Miss Cheng?

538
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:45,760
It might have been a matter of life and death earlier.

539
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,310
Is this how you treat the common people?

540
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:48,730
Miss Cheng, you're overthinking.

541
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:50,330
Our Feng State is peaceful and prosperous.

542
00:25:50,330 --> 00:25:51,270
There's no life-and-death matter.

543
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:51,990
Right.

544
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:54,960
If there's nothing else, we'll be leaving.

545
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:56,590
I haven't said anything yet.

546
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,700
I haven't told you my matters yet.

547
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:02,270
Alright, Honey.

548
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,610
Honey, alright, alright.

549
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:04,540
Do not get angry.

550
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:05,570
Do not get angry.

551
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:07,870
This is all because

552
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:09,890
the Feng State highly values education.

553
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:11,750
Everyone is eager to take the civil service exams,

554
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:13,980
but no one applies for the martial arts exams.

555
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,800
The city guards and the officials

556
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,130
are selected randomly.

557
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:17,920
So,

558
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,880
this leads to sloppy work.

559
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,480
In that case,

560
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:25,510
the Imperial Censor is also selected randomly?

561
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,170
Not at all.

562
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,790
Only those who pass the martial arts exams and become martial champion

563
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:31,330
can be appointed as Imperial Censor.

564
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:34,670
I've decided.

565
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,750
I will take the martial arts exams.

566
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:40,020
I will become the martial champion.

567
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:42,970
I will become the Feng State's first female Imperial Censor.

568
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:45,630
The Feng State's first female Imperial Censor?

569
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:46,310
Yes.

570
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:49,050
I want to uphold justice for the people.

571
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:50,970
While I am still in this world,

572
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:53,140
I'll protect everyone I care about

573
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:56,230
and fulfill the professional dream I haven't achieved.

574
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:57,000
Honey.

575
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:58,570
Will you support me?

576

Yi.

577
00:27:00,770 --> 00:27:02,850
The Wen family has a special status.

578
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:07,510
To avoid concerns from the court and potential disturbances,

579
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,750
I established a family rule

580
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:10,660
that prohibits participating in the Imperial exams

581
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,080
or holding official positions.

582
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,870
It's a pity for your talent in the academic field and government service.

583
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:17,810
Father, I understand your concerns.

584
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:19,470
I won't feel sorry for it.

585
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,820
Even if I spend my whole life teaching in the academy,

to give life meaning for the people,

just go ahead and do it.

Well.

607

What did Miss Cheng say?

608

Did you hear that clearly?

614
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,730
You should stay at home, and support your family.

615

Isn't that a nice thing to do?

616
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:40,100
Why bother participating in such a crude thing as the martial arts exams?
