00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:28,028
Get off me!

5
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:32,240
What? You can throw in a punch, too.

6
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:35,118
You used to beat me
when I didn't listen to you.

7
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:36,494
Have you given up on me now?

00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:40,582

(coughs)

11
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:42,792
Hey, are you all right?

12
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:47,005
-Darn it. Hey.
-(groans)

13
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:50,258
I said stop.

14
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:52,010
Stop what?

15
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:55,930
It's too late, man.

16
00:00:57,807 --> 00:01:01,061
If you knew,
you should've stopped me sooner!

17
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,688
Don't hit me in the face.

18
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,274
Jiwoo is getting married tomorrow.

19
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,252
Do you have any regrets about your life?

20
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:27,921
I don't.

21
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:32,008
What's your biggest regret?

22
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:33,301
I said I don't have any.

23
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:34,344
What is it?

24
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:36,971
It's you, fool.

25
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:38,973
Letting you be who you are now.

26
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:43,812
Not doing something sooner, like you said.

27
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:48,316
Darn it. It's so you
to say something like that.

MALE VOICE:
How does it feel to be a murderer?

62
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:25,867
Hyunseok...

63
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:27,660
Did you kill him?

64
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,787
I told you to listen to me, didn't I?

65
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:32,165
If you hadn't been so stubborn,
he wouldn't have died.

66
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,626
I killed him,
but you're the one who got him killed.

67
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,504
If I hadn't gone to see him,
would you not have killed him?

68
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:41,632
If you refuse to do what I say again
or tell anyone about me,

69
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,926
another person will die.

70
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,178
Just like Woo Hyunseok.

71
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:48,306
And you will be framed again
like you are now.

72
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,059
It's no use recording this call, right?

73
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:53,561
You're a veteran indeed.
You're quick to assess the situation.

74
00:05:53,644 --> 00:05:54,771
TAEKROK: What's the evidence?

75
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:57,982
-The evidence that I killed Hyunseok.
-MALE VOICE: No, it's a witness.

76
00:05:58,066 --> 00:06:01,361
A witness who was at the scene
when you killed him.

77
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:04,906
And what if I say I'm being threatened?

78
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:07,325
Your sentence will only get heavier
for fabricating an alibi.

79
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,369
If I disappear now,

80
00:06:10,119 --> 00:06:14,040
you'll be locked up in prison for the rest
of your life until the day you die.

You're thoroughly prepared.

86

MALE VOICE: Of course. I know whom
I'm up against. It wasn't easy.

87
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,357
What do you want?

88
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:40,566
To play a game.

89
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,068
A game?

90
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:44,654
(siren wailing)

91
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:50,743
(exhales heavily)

92
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:55,623
-What kind of game?
-If you win, you can arrest me.

93
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:56,791
And if you win?

94
00:06:56,874 --> 00:07:00,503
You'll be arrested instead of me
for murdering Woo Hyunseok.

95
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:03,172
How is this a fair game
when I'm being cornered?

96
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,757
It's one-sided and dirty.

97
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,217
You have no choice.

98
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,221
But I'll give you a clue to find me.

99
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:11,806
A clue? What clue?

100
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:13,933
I will keep calling you.

101
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:15,810
That's the clue.

102
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:20,189
The only clue to catch me.
Aren't I being kind enough?

103
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,315
(sighs)

104
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,317
What if I refuse to play?

105
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:24,652
You won't.

106
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:27,363
Why? Because you're confident
that you'll catch me.

107
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,866
Even though the only clue is phone calls.

108
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,162
You're confident
that without anyone's help

109
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:39,208
and without dragging it out,
you can catch me by yourself.

110
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,044
Just as you always have been.

111
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:43,921
Am I wrong?

112
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:46,132
(sighs)

113
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:48,342
So what's the game?

114
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,635
It's very simple.

115
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,180
Look back on your past.

116
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,307
TAEKROK: My past...

117
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:58,644
MALE VOICE: You just need to do as I say
while doing what you can to find me.

118
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:01,439
In your past, you can find me
and the reason I'm doing this.

119
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,858
Isn't that simple?

120
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:05,943
(suspenseful music)

121
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:08,946

122
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,075
TAEKROK: So you're confident
that you won't get caught.

123
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,453
MALE VOICE: Just hurry
and try to catch me.

124
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:23,252
I will catch you...

125
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,797
no matter what.

126
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:35,556
Woo Hyunseok fell to his death.
You get what I'm saying, right?

127
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,894
Act wisely when you deal with the police,
like the veteran that you are.

128
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:41,354
I'll call you again.

129
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:44,482
This game will not end
until one of us dies.

-Has this been leaked?
-We've done everything to prevent it.

146
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:42,224
Do you think Section Chief Kook
can handle Taekrok?

147
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,756
Before I came in, I thought about

148
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:17,510
how I should shake up a veteran detective
with 30 years of experience.

149
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:20,388
No matter how good my questions are,

150
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:23,182
you'd know how to answer them...

151
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:28,020
to weasel your way out.

152
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:29,814
Am I right?

153
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:31,482
Because...

154
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:33,526
I didn't do it.

155
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:39,490
You're a suspect for now.

156
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:53,212
(tense music)

157
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,430
Why did you guys fight?

158
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:06,892
We got caught up
in some musty old memories.

159
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:09,353
More like your musty old emotional baggage

160
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,564
blew up.

161
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,697
You don't seem shocked

162
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:22,491
about Section Chief Woo's death.

163
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,660
Your fellow detective is dead.

164
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:26,620
A detective...

165
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:30,082
doesn't grieve
until they catch the culprit.

166
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,083
I see.

167
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:35,963
So you are sad, but you're holding it in
until you catch the culprit?

168
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:39,341
Jeez, that's impressive.

169
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:45,723
Mocking the suspect
to make them confess...

170
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:49,310
is an obvious trick.

171
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:50,936
Of course. You're the expert.

172
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:57,818
You're actually enjoying this, aren't you?

173
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:03,282
All we have are circumstances
and no clear evidence.

174
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:07,578
You're thinking, whatever we do to prove
you guilty, you'll find your way out.

175
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,163
Aren't you?

176
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:21,634
With that kind of soft attitude,
what kind of idiot...

177
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:25,054
would confess?

178
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:29,934
In your statement,

179
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,604
you said you went to the scene
in the middle of the night,

180
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:37,566
because you suddenly got worried
out of the blue for no reason.

181
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,860
It's completely random.

182
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,446
What's with this response?

183
00:13:44,073 --> 00:13:47,368
MALE VOICE: If you refuse to do
what I say again or tell anyone about me,

184
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:49,161
another person will die.

185
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,287
Just like Woo Hyunseok.

186
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,499
And you will be framed again
like you are now.

187
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,298
(sighs)

188
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,010
-And the examination?
-Why were you in the mountain?

189
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,888
Because I suddenly got worried
out of the blue for no reason.

190
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:10,474
(scoffs)

191
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,480
You know how he died.

192
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,568
What's the cause of his death?

193
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,904
Answer my question first. Why did you go
to the mountain at that hour?

194
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,573
I said, what's the cause of his death?

195
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,127
(sighs)

196
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,421
Multiple traumas
by a great external force.

197
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:42,840
His liver, spleen, and everything
were damaged all at once.

198
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:45,426
We haven't found proof
of other external forces yet.

199
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,804
DEATH CERTIFICATE

200
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:54,226
-That means he fell to his death.
-Won't be sure until the autopsy result.

201
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,519
Any possibility of murder?

202
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:01,609
All of this points to one person.

203
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:06,030
Why didn't you report it right away?

204
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:09,825
Act wisely when you deal with the police,
like the veteran that you are.

205
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:13,120
I don't remember.

206
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,790
I don't remember how I got home.

207
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:19,835
TAEKROK: I woke up
and found myself in my room.

208
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,796
-Gosh.
-Hey, how did I get home last night?

209
00:15:23,297 --> 00:15:24,548
-By taxi.
-Taxi?

210
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:28,010
TAEKROK: He probably used a taxi
to avoid getting his car traced.

211
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,512
What?

212
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,097
TAEKROK:
And he had the taxi driver call Gong...

213
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,265
Hey.

214
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:35,601
...to make an alibi...

215
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:36,852
GONG: He's freaking heavy.

216
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,605
...and to make him a witness.

217
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,942
He got Gong to put me in my room...

218
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,695
to leave a record of it.

219
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,074
You don't remember?

220
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:54,078
(sighs)
I don't understand at all.

221
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:55,245
It's true.

222
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:56,580
I don't remember.

223
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:59,291
I checked your medical records.
You've had psychiatric treatment.

224
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,045
Does that have something
to do with your memory problem?

225
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:13,806
-Get the chief in here.
-I'm in charge of this case.

226
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:16,809
Gwangsu. If you want
to finish this quickly, get in here now.

227
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,603
Where is your cell phone?

228
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:20,688
I don't know. I lost it.

229
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:22,106
TAEKROK: I said get in here!

230
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,581
Give us a minute alone.

231
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,459
-Chief.
-TAEKROK: Turn off the recording devices!

232
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:53,929
(door closes)

233
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:58,225
GEUMO POLICE STATION

234
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,353
What do you think
they're talking about for so long?

235
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:03,522
Beats me.

236
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,024
(sighs)

237
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,650
It still haunts me.

238
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:09,528
I wish we hadn't seen
the two of them last night.

239
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:14,783
(door opens)

240
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,788
I'm keeping you in custody.

241
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:35,095
Relieve him from his duties
and form a team for this case.

242
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:36,847
But for now,

243
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:39,266
report this as accidental death
by loss of footing.

244
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:40,309
GWANGSU: Do you agree?

245
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:44,313
Let's give him some time.

246
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:49,234
-Do you want to explain this, sir?
-Later.

247
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,407
Hey, Officer Son. Come see me for a bit.

248
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,618
Yes, sir.

249
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,251
(gloomy music)

250
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:19,264
(breathes deeply)

251
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:55,801
DETECTIVE 1: Hey, to the conference room.

252
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:57,302
HAN: Yes, I'm coming.

253
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:05,477
I should go, too.

254
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:16,738
(gloomy music)

255
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:24,955
(sighs)

256
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,565
(gloomy music)

257
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,877
-(exhales sharply)
-(seat belt clicks)

258
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,146
(car engine starts)

259
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:44,201
What did the chief say?

260
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:49,373
He just said I should learn
from my superiors as much as I can.

261
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:51,959
That's what he said?

262
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:55,629
By the way,
do you think this makes any sense?

263
00:20:55,712 --> 00:20:58,173
I mean, I still can't believe
they're suspecting Detective Kim.

264
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:03,762
-What about you?
-Sorry?

265
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:05,138
What do you think?

266
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:09,685
I checked your medical records.
You've had psychiatric treatment.

267
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:12,145
Me? I'm certain.

268
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:13,981
(sighs)

269
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,465
He came to a wedding at a time like this?

270
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:43,927
He doesn't go to weddings. Only funerals.

271
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,220
Hmm...

272
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,140
Do you think he's here to investigate?

273
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:51,351
He's wearing a suit,
which he never does, and even a tie.

274
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:53,312
He does have a daughter.

275
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:54,688
(sighs)

276
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:57,649
His daughter is getting married
on the day he became a murder suspect?

277
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,192
That's just terrible.

278
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:00,861
GUEST 1: Congratulations.

279
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:03,280
JUNGAE: Thank you for taking the time
to come today.

280
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:05,615
-Have you seen Jiwoo?
-GUEST 1: Yes, she looks beautiful.

281
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:08,452
-JUNGAE: She does, doesn't she?
-GUEST 2: Yes. I'll see you later, then.

282
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:09,536
JUNGAE: Sure. Excuse me.

283
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,542
-What happened?
-What do you mean?

284
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:18,378
What did you do
with the wedding invitations I gave you?

285
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:22,174
I was at least expecting
some flowers from the police.

286
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:24,134
You didn't give them out?

287
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:26,595
-I never let anyone invite me either.
-(sighs)

288
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:30,140
The one and only detective, aren't you?
So busy catching all the criminals

289
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:32,684
that you shame your only daughter
on her wedding day.

290
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,269
What a great father you are.

291
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:36,980
You've got something on your face.

292
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:44,821
Don't you do anything silly later.

293
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:47,324
-Hello.
-Hello.

294
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:49,159
-GUEST 3: Your daughter looks beautiful.
-JUNGAE: She does.

295
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:50,744
GUEST 4: You raised her
into a beautiful woman.

296
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:51,703
JUNGAE: Thank you.

297
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:53,330
All right, I'll see you in there.

298
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:55,374
HOST: The ceremony will begin shortly.

299
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:57,626
-Please get inside the hall.
-JUNGAE: Hello.

300
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:03,840
(romantic music)

301
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:07,469
LEE JAEHO AND KIM JIWOO
OUR STORY

302
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:42,587
THANK YOU TO OUR PARENTS FOR RAISING US.
WE'LL LIVE A HAPPY LIFE TOGETHER.

303
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:51,221
(romantic music)

304
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:29,718
Gosh, we're tailing him
when we're supposed to congratulate him.

305
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:33,346
If he knew,
he'd be very disappointed, right?

306
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:36,558
(sighs)

307
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,436
He's out.

308
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:44,649
What? Why is he coming this way?

309
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:45,984
What are you doing?

310
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:47,694
We need to hide.

311
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:57,496
Hello.

312
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:58,747
Get out.

313
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,082
What a surprise to see you here.

314
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:03,627
-Come and eat.
-Okay.

315
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:06,880
I knew it was a bad idea to take my car.

316
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:09,758
We should've taken another car.

317
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:11,718
You think that would've made a difference?

318
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:13,053
Are you really going to eat?

319
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,972
We're his only guests.

320
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,726
I can't wait to be done with this.

321
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:24,648
This wedding hall must be popular.
The food here is great.

322
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:34,366
We've been assigned to the team
for Section Chief Woo's case.

323
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:37,202
So what?

324
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,541
(slurps)

325
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:47,045
You don't have your wallet.
Keep the receipts.

326
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,340
It's yours.

327
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:52,634
I'm going to splurge.

328
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:56,805
And I'm going to claim it all later.

329
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,849
JUNGAE'S BROTHER: Taekrok!

330
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:01,810
Why haven't you returned my calls?

331
00:26:01,893 --> 00:26:03,728
-Hey.
-Taekrok.

332
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:04,896
(sighs)

333
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:12,654
I know this happened a long time ago,
but I still don't understand.

334
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:17,075
Why did you divorce my sister?

335
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:21,121
She said she didn't want to get a divorce,

336
00:26:21,204 --> 00:26:23,582
but you asked for it.

337
00:26:23,665 --> 00:26:27,836
Since then you've been paying her alimony,
child support, and everything.

338
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:31,590
I heard that you live in a gosiwon now.

339
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:35,927
Why do you live like that?
Seriously, Taekrok. I feel terrible.

340
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:38,305
-That's the best I can do.
-(scoffs)

341
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:40,765
Taekrok. Let's talk...

342
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:43,143
-What are you doing?
-Jungae.

343
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:48,189
JUNGAE'S BROTHER: I haven't seen Taekrok
in a while, and I feel bad for the guy.

344
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,233
-JUNGAE: That's enough!
-JUNGAE'S BROTHER: Taekrok!

345
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:51,776
JUNGAE: What is the matter with you?

346
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,695
JUNGAE'S BROTHER: Jungae.

347
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:56,865
I heard he's the one
who got Jiwoo her house.

348
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:59,409
How could you treat him this way?

349
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:01,494
(classical music playing)

350
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:13,590
Dad.

351
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,636
-Let's take the stairs.
-Okay.

352
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:24,351
Don't worry about what Mom and Uncle said.

353
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:26,895
I know.

354
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:28,813
Okay.

355
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,526
Lately, I think a lot about the old days.

356
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,613
I didn't realize it before.

357
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,574
But thank you...

358
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:41,910
for everything.

359
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:44,746
(soft chuckle)

360
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:49,876
I'll be off, then.

361
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:51,920
Okay.

362
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:54,964
(beeps)

363
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:08,144
(chuckles)

364
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:11,898
(dramatic music)

365
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,323
(sighs)

366
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:24,411
(inhales deeply)

367
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:38,883
(dramatic music)

368
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,408
STAFF 1: Excuse me.

369
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:07,036
-You're Ms. Kim Jiwoo's father, right?
-Yes.

370
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,831
The person who delivered these flowers
wanted me to give this to you.

371
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:12,917
I almost forgot.

372
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:31,644
I WISH YOU A LIFETIME OF HAPPINESS
FROM YOUR DAD'S FRIEND

373
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:33,271
FRIEND

374
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:35,356
(tense music)

375
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:09,516
ANSWER YOUR PHONE

376
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:27,784
(suspenseful music)

377
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:38,044
Sir, he just turned on his phone.

378
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:42,507
What do we do?

379
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:46,344
-Keep tracking him and keep me posted.
-Yes, sir.

380
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:48,221
What's the update on his whereabouts
on the day of the incident?

381
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:50,640
There aren't many operational CCTVs
near the mountain.

382
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:53,142
We're trying to trail him,
but we keep losing his tracks.

383
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:55,770
He might have been
intentionally avoiding the cameras.

384
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,063
Take a look at this first.

385
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:01,776
GEUMOBUDU-RO 33BEON-GIL

386
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:21,379
Call the taxi company,
find out who the driver was, locate him.

387
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:24,090
Okay.

388
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:25,592
Excuse me, sir.

389
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:29,137
-Could I talk to you for a minute?
-Sure.

390
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:31,764
(sighs)

391
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:36,144
(cell phone buzzes)

392
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:41,691
NO CALLER ID

393
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:46,195
MALE VOICE: Did you like the flowers?
I tried to pick nice ones.

394
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:47,447
That's enough.

395
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:49,991
There's a limit to my patience.

396
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:51,492
Let's meet.

397
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,329
I'll come alone.

398
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:55,705
Fine, let's meet.

399
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:56,831
Where do you want to meet?

400
00:31:57,498 --> 00:32:01,002
Before we do that, do you remember
the fratricide case from ten years ago?

401
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:04,839
A man killed his older brother
for inheritance and buried him in secret.

402
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:07,258
After that, he was arrested.

403
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:11,512
But that case turned out
to be a total mess.

404
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:13,514
This is fake evidence.

405
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:15,224
Was it you?

406
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:18,519
Was it you?

407
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:23,274
It was you, Choi Kyoil.

408
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:25,318
That's not mine!

409
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:28,488
You fabricated it.

410
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:30,490
MALE VOICE: That knife was fabricated.

411
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:32,742
Find the real weapon
and reveal it to the world.

412
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:33,910
And the person behind it.

413
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:36,579
What does that case have to do
with Woo Hyunseok?

414
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,915
It all started because of him.

415
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,000
What did he do?

416
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:43,044
Do you have time to waste? I don't.

417
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:44,420
You have until tomorrow.

418
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:45,672
Hey, are you...

419
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:49,258
Choi Kyoil?

420
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:53,096
MALE VOICE: Did you think this game
was going to be that easy? Try harder.

421
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:54,263
(line trills)

422
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,518
TAEKROK: Why the false evidence?

423
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:00,478
Why the fratricide case?

424
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:06,067
By the way, what did he mean
when he said that's the best he can do?

425
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,444
That's the best I can do.

426
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,115
(sighs)

427
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,117
When his daughter was little,

428
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:18,371
she was kidnapped
by a criminal that he caught.

429
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:24,836
The criminals kept threatening his family,
so they had to move from place to place.

430
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:28,131
Why didn't he quit his job, then?

431
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:31,551
Do you think they would've left
his family alone if he had just quit?

432
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,514
He just did what he thought was best.

433
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:38,808
I don't know.

434
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:41,602
Not all homicide detectives are like that.

435
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:44,564
Detective Kim only went
after the most vicious criminals

436
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:46,232
that the other detectives avoided.

437
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:50,903
(cell phone buzzing)

438
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:52,655
(sighs)

439
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:55,074
-Yes?
-I need information about the culprit

440
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:57,368
from the 2012 Suam-ri fratricide case.

441
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:58,786
Okay, anything else?

442
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,163
That's it for now.

443
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:01,789
It's urgent.

444
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,127
Should we follow him?

445
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,337
-Let's go.
-Where?

446
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:13,926
I'm not really sure

447
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:16,387
if I should tell you this or not.

448
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:18,056
I mean, I think I should, but...

449
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:19,223
Don't, if you feel uneasy.

450
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:21,934
No. It's not that. I don't feel uneasy.

451
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:27,523
Those two committed a lot of corruption.

452
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:32,236
-Those two?
-Section Chief Woo and the chief.

453
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:37,825
You know that in a small town like this,
the local notables are all best buds, yes?

454
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,453
They stick together and embezzle money

455
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:43,081
in the name
of community development and all.

456
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:46,626
And Section Chief Woo
took care of everything for them,

457
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:49,462
making sure there was no problem.

458
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:53,091
He didn't have enough power
to do all that by himself.

459
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:55,760
The chief must have
backed him up in secret.

460
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:01,015
(tense music)

461
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:06,813
Let's give him some time.

462
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:11,484
Rumor has it that they've raked in...

463
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,403
a whopping amount of slush funds.

464
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:18,741
I'm telling you this,
because I trust you, okay?

465
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:23,329
The one that I find most suspicious
is Chief Seo.

466
00:35:24,247 --> 00:35:26,582
Now that the section chief is dead,
he can just blame him

467
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:29,335
for all the corruption and irregularities

468
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:33,422
and have all that slush funds to himself.

469
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:36,175
Frankly, I think he just killed
two birds with one stone.

470
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,972
-Detective Han.
-Yes?

471
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:42,431
Will you do me a personal favor?

472
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:43,474
A personal one?

473
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,643
Trace the chief
on the day of the incident,

474
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:49,063
and look into the irregularities that he
and the section chief have committed.

475
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:52,275
I'm honored
that you asked me to do it, but--

476
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:54,152
Don't you want to make team leader?

477
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:57,446
-Do you want to go golfing sometime?
-I don't play golf.

478
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:00,533
I see.

479
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:02,994
How about we go fishing instead?

480
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,079
Really?

481
00:36:05,830 --> 00:36:06,831
Right.

482
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:10,793
If I remember correctly,

483
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:12,211
Section Chief Woo...

484
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:14,463
used two cell phones.

485
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:23,014
NOEUL GOSIWON

486
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:29,979
A MAN KILLS AND SECRETLY BURIES
HIS OWN BROTHER

487

THE GEUMOSAN MOUNTAIN FRATRICIDE CASE

488
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:32,356
SECRET BURIAL AFTER INHERITANCE DISPUTE

489
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:34,734
BURIED BODY FOUND IN GEUMOSAN MOUNTAIN

490
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,361
CULPRIT OF GEUMOSAN MURDER CASE CAUGHT...
POLICE QUICKLY ACQUIRES EVIDENCE

491
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:43,367
CHIEF DETECTIVE IN CHARGE, SEO GWANGSU,
RECEIVES SPECIAL PROMOTION

492
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:50,750
SUSPECT OF FRATRICIDE CASE
CLAIMS EVIDENCE TO BE FALSE

493
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,543
It was you, Choi Kyoil.

494
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:54,670
That's not mine!

495
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:56,005
Not yours?

496
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:00,968
Then where is yours?

497
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:03,554
It was you, wasn't it?

498
00:37:04,138 --> 00:37:05,389
You fabricated it, didn't you?

499
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:08,935
EVIDENCE FOUND, 19 YEARS OF IMPRISONMENT
SUSPECT MR CHOI CLAIMS "THIS ISN'T RIGHT"

500
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:12,104
(cell phone buzzing)

501
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:17,068
-Yes.
-SUNGA: I found it.

502
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:18,152
Hang on.

503
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:19,487
CHOI KYOIL, FRATRICIDE

504
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:20,988
Wait.

505
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:21,906
DATE OF SUSPENSION
JAN 19, 2022

506
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:23,532
His sentence was suspended.

507
00:37:23,616 --> 00:37:24,867
His sentence was suspended?

508
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:26,953
(suspenseful music)

509
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,247
Where is he now?

510
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:33,960
Sir.

511
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:37,171
I could only find one cell phone
under the section chief's name.

512
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,506
But he definitely carried two.

513
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:41,384
Could it be a burner phone?

514
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:43,302
I think so. What do we do, then?

515
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:46,514
Trace his whereabouts and see if you
can find the number of the other phone.

516
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:49,976
-Especially before and after his death.
-Yes, sir. I will.

517
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:56,774
HANBIT REHABILITATION HOSPITAL

518
00:37:56,857 --> 00:37:59,360
STAFF 2: He was in Geumo Detention Center
until his sentence was suspended

519
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:01,862
when he was diagnosed
with terminal blood cancer.

520
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:05,074
He's been staying at Hanbit
Rehabilitation Hospital since January.

521
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:12,123
CHOI KYOIL, MALE, 43

522
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:19,422
Where is the weapon?

523
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,923
What weapon?

524
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:22,258
Where did you hide it?

525
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:24,135
(sighs)

526
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:26,762
Darn it, you're driving me crazy.

527
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:31,225
Look, detective.

528
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:34,395
If you don't find it,

529
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:36,689
I'll be found innocent, right?

530
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,155
So...

531
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:47,074
let me go.

532
00:38:52,038 --> 00:38:53,289
Excuse me.

533
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:55,916
Are you his guardian?

534
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,126
No.

535
00:38:57,752 --> 00:38:59,378
-I'm a detective.
-I see.

536
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:03,257
Is he able to move around?
Is he ever conscious?

537
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,759
No.

538
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:08,888
He's been bedridden for a month now
after his condition started to get worse.

539
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:11,432
He regains consciousness sometimes,
but only for a short moment.

540
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:13,184
Any visitors?

541
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:16,312
You're the first visitor
since he came here.

542
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:21,942
TAEKROK: He's not the friend.

543
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:25,196
If you can reach his family, please do.

544
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,573
He's in critical condition.

545
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:31,202
I see. Please call me if he wakes up.

546
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:32,661
It's important.

547
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:34,372
Okay, I'll let the other nurses know.

548
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:37,666

INMATE VISITOR LIST

551
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:53,849
VISIT REFUSED

552
00:39:54,892 --> 00:39:56,143
Who is this person?

553
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:01,273
LEE MYUNGHEE

554
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:03,109
Oh, her?

555
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:06,404
-She said she was the victim's mother.
-The victim's mother?

556
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:09,031
That's what she said herself.

557
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,200
I won't tell anyone.

558
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:16,205
Please just tell me where she is. Please?

559
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:18,332
Guard.

560
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:20,418
I'm done here.

561
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:29,927
Please just tell me where Seyoung is!
I beg you!

562
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:33,013
Please.

563
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:35,433
GUARD: Choi Kyoil agreed
to see her at first.

564
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:38,477
But after a while, he started refusing
and never saw her again.

565
00:40:43,023 --> 00:40:46,444
By the way,
was there another victim in that case?

566
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:52,032
DETECTIVE 2: Come on!

567
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:56,370
Hurry and get in!

568
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,789
You're the detective
on the fratricide case, right?

569
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:00,583
Who...

570
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:03,836
This is my daughter. She hasn't come home
since the day of the incident.

571
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:05,421
Taekrok, let's go!

572
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:09,717
-You can report missing persons upstairs.
-I reported it a long time ago.

573
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:13,637
Detective. My daughter passes by the scene
of the crime on her way home from school.

574
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,055
She's never left home before.

575
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:18,976
-Taekrok, we're short on time!
-I'll check with the detectives.

576
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:22,605
My daughter
might have been killed by that man.

577
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:24,607
Right. Please wait at home.

578
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:27,735
Wait, detective.

579
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:30,404
(sobs)

580
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:39,205
(siren wailing)

581
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,290
Who is she?

582
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:44,585
You got that missing person's
report, right?

583
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:45,753
HAN: Yes, I handled it.

584
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:48,255
But the Women and Juvenile
Affairs Division took it over,

585
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,007
and I handed over all the documents.

586
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,675
-What happened next?
-Next?

587
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:53,761
Well, I don't know what happened next.

588
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:56,347
Come on. Think harder, kid.

589
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:59,099
I couldn't remember even if I tried.
It was a long time ago.

590
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:01,560
As you know, we're all assigned
to tons of cases.

591
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:04,563
I can't remember every detail
of every case.

592
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:06,774
But why do you ask...

593
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:08,025
(sighs)

594
00:42:08,817 --> 00:42:10,819

CIVIL AFFAIRS
GEUMO DETENTION CENTER

596
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:40,349
TAEKROK: If the girl is still missing,

597
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:44,395
it's likely that Choi Kyoil
also killed her back then.

598
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:47,898
And if her remains are found now...

599
00:42:49,275 --> 00:42:51,068
Choi Kyoil is the culprit.

600
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:57,992
(breathes deeply)

601
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:03,831
(line ringing)

602
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:05,499
-SUNGA: Yes?
-Hey.

603
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:07,751
I need you to identify a missing person

604
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:10,087
and get me her information.

605
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:14,508
And the contact numbers of the testifiers.

606

DONGYANG LURE FISHING SHOP

607
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:26,395
SUNGA: Her name is Han Seyoung.
She was in 11th grade at the time.

608
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:29,481
She's still missing.

609
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:34,236
The one you described is her mother.

610
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:37,948
She comes to the station every now
and then to check on the progress.

611
00:43:40,284 --> 00:43:42,453
CHILD MISSING

612
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:48,876
The testifiers are Seyoung's friends

613
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:51,170
who left school with her that day.

614
00:43:56,508 --> 00:43:58,093
Yes, I'm sure.

615
00:43:58,844 --> 00:44:01,597
Something must've happened
to Seyoung after we parted ways

616
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:03,182
at the entrance of Geumosan Mountain.

617
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:06,935
SEYOUNG'S FRIEND:
What good are the police?

618
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:08,395
I told them many times.

619
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:11,815
Seyoung disappeared in that mountain.

620
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:14,985
My daughter
might have been killed by that man.

621
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:22,242
(trills)

622
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:24,286
(line rings)

623
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,330
GWANGSU: What is it?

624
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:27,873
Gwangsu.

625
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,542
Let me gather some guys.

626
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:33,712
-What are you talking about?
-TAEKROK: I need to do a search right now.

627
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:35,881
What do you need to search for
out of the blue?

628
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:37,925
Don't you want to catch
the culprit quickly?

629
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:39,968
Have you found a lead?

630
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:42,763
The fratricide case from ten years ago.

631
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:44,014
Choi Kyoil.

632
00:44:46,558 --> 00:44:47,685
Come into the station first.

633
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:48,936
I can't waste any more time.

634
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:51,772
Explain why you're searching for
and what is going on first!

635
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:53,148
The false evidence.

636
00:44:55,317 --> 00:44:56,777
CHOI KYOIL

637
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,822
(suspenseful music)

638
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:04,076
The weapon Choi Kyoil used.

639
00:45:10,124 --> 00:45:11,625
Hey, where did you find this?

640
00:45:11,709 --> 00:45:14,878
-Around where the body was buried.
-But we searched that entire area.

641
00:45:16,463 --> 00:45:17,756
Are you certain this is it?

642
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:20,509
Check the fingerprints
and the bloodstains.

643
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:22,469
TAEKROK: You knew.

644
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:28,100
Don't make assumptions.
I didn't know then, and I still don't.

645
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:29,143
That's not true.

646
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:30,811
You chose to ignore it.

647
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:33,105
Because the evidence
you were so desperately looking for

648
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:35,774
showed up right in front of you.

649
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:37,818
What are you trying to say?

650
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:41,029
What if I tell people
that you knew about it?

651
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:44,783
Or that I fabricated it on your orders?

652
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:47,703
I'll just get fired,
but you'll have to resign with dishonor.

653
00:45:47,786 --> 00:45:49,288
You want to be a city councilor?

654
00:45:49,788 --> 00:45:50,831
That won't happen.

655
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:02,009
That's enough nonsense.
What does that have to do with this case?

656
00:46:02,092 --> 00:46:03,719
There was one more victim.

657
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:08,182
We have to find her right now.

658
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:09,433
If we do, then what?

659
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:11,393
We'll know once we do.

660
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:14,521
Send the guys to Geumosan Mountain.

661
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:16,315
I'll meet them there.

662
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:20,444
(sighs)

663
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:29,244
Catch the murderer.

664
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:31,997
One week. I can't give you
any more than that.

665
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:34,208
And if I fail?

666
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:37,169
Then you'll be detained
and charged with murder.

667
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:40,714
Or you'll pretend like it was an accident
and bury this case forever.

668
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:43,008
(suspenseful music)

669
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:54,019
(dogs barking)

670
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:58,106
DETECTIVE 3: Unit One,
to the right! Move it!

671
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:01,401
(dogs whimpering)

672
00:47:20,462 --> 00:47:25,175
(shovel rasping)

673
00:47:31,515 --> 00:47:34,351
(panting)

674
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:06,383
Uh...

675
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:10,596
(whimpering)

676
00:48:10,679 --> 00:48:15,183
(Seyoung screaming)

677
00:48:15,267 --> 00:48:17,352
(thwacking)

678
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:27,112
(dogs barking)

679
00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:30,032
(sirens wailing)

680
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:39,166
What are you doing here?

681
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:47,883
There's something I missed ten years ago.

682
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:51,094
Is it related to the section chief's case?

683
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:52,679
TAEKROK: I don't know that yet.

684
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:55,223
HAN (whispers): About his cell phone.

685
00:48:57,768 --> 00:48:59,645
-Hey.
-Yes?

686
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:02,022
I don't mean to butt in
on your investigation,

687
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:04,650
but whose cell phone
are you talking about?

688
00:49:06,151 --> 00:49:09,446
Apparently, Section Chief Woo
used two cell phones when he was alive.

689
00:49:09,529 --> 00:49:11,073
Do you know anything about it?

690
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:21,375
A lot of detectives
use two or three phones.

691
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:23,835
-I also use two.
-Where are they?

692
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:24,836
What?

693
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,423
I told you I lost them.

694
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:29,466
Forget about that.

695
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,885
What about Hyunseok's phones?

696
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:34,304
One of them is a burner phone.

697
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:39,393
-You were saying?
-I couldn't find anything.

698
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:41,478
There was nothing in his office.

699
00:49:44,564 --> 00:49:47,567
Please go back to the station
and check the CCTV footage more thoroughly

700
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:50,404
to see what the suspect was up to
on the day of the incident.

701
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:51,446
Okay.

702
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:56,493
The suspect can't remember a thing,
so we should help him remember.

703
00:49:57,995 --> 00:49:59,204
I'd appreciate that.

704
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:02,249
I'll get going, then.
(clears throat)

705
00:50:07,045 --> 00:50:08,130
Where are you going?

706
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:10,424
To the crime scene.

707
00:50:10,882 --> 00:50:12,926
I'm going to go back there
to try to remember

708
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,636
if I really killed Hyunseok like you said.

709
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:15,804
Who knows?

710
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:17,556
I might turn myself in.

711
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:24,396
If you do, you'll get a lighter sentence.

712
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:30,527
What is he searching for here?

713
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:41,038
(eerie music)

714
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,699
TAEKROK: Hyunseok talked to someone
on the phone at the tavern.

715
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:18,742
Did you check that?

716
00:51:18,825 --> 00:51:20,410
There was no call history.

717
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:22,788
TAEKROK: Hyunseok was using
his burner phone.

718
00:51:23,872 --> 00:51:26,416
And he was talking to the friend.

719
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:29,419
He got Hyunseok to come out here.

720
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:32,047
Why did he want to meet here?

721
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:35,467
Is he familiar with this area?

722
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:40,138
The taxi driver said Section Chief Woo
went to the mountain alone.

723
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:41,640
TAEKROK: Alone.

724
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:44,351
That means they either made plans
to meet beforehand,

725
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:46,853
or he made the appointment at the tavern.

726
00:51:47,729 --> 00:51:48,814
Meeting up...

727
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:51,149
on short notice.

728
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:53,151
MALE VOICE: Don't go,
you'll regret it if you go.

729
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:55,612
TAEKROK: He knew that I was going to
see Hyunseok.

730
00:51:56,905 --> 00:51:58,615
Was it Hyunseok that wanted to see him?

731
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:01,034
Or was it him?

732
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:15,132
Come on, fill your lungs
with fresh air instead.

733
00:52:17,008 --> 00:52:18,760
(Hyunseok scoffs)
Isn't this place nice?

734
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:22,264
I often come up here
and organize my thoughts.

735
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:25,684
It is nice, but it's a bit dangerous.

736
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:27,769
-Be careful.
-(Hyunseok scoffs)

737
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:30,772
Old man, you are becoming a coward.

738
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:33,984
-HYUNSEOK: Hey!
-TAEKROK: Darn it!

739
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:35,694
(laughing)

740
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:37,404
Jeez.

741
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:40,532
TAEKROK: The friend didn't lure him here.

742
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:42,450
Hyunseok must've asked to meet here.

743
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:44,661
Why did he want to meet here?

744
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:46,454
Why?

745
00:52:51,459 --> 00:52:54,004
He came to negotiate,
but something went wrong.

746
00:52:55,297 --> 00:52:56,214
-And in the end...
-Aah!

747
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:58,258
(thuds)

748
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:00,594
TAEKROK: The important thing is...

749
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:02,804
it wasn't their first time meeting.

750
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:04,347
That means the friend is...

751
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:11,813
Hey, I said no drugs, didn't I?

752
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:14,107
TAEKROK: Is it Mr. Cheon after all?

753
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:17,027
But he has nothing to do
with the fratricide case.

754
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:18,612
No connection whatsoever.

755
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:20,697
False evidence?

756
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:23,408
Mr. Cheon has nothing to do
with that either.

757
00:53:24,993 --> 00:53:27,621
What on earth does the friend want?

758
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:32,250
(leaves rustling)

759
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:44,971
TAEKROK: Why...

760
00:53:46,014 --> 00:53:47,390
is this here?

761
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:00,445
It's him.

762
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:04,491
(ominous music)

763
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:08,745
(dog barks)

764
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:22,133
(panting)

765
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:44,572
(grunts)

766
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:22,694
(panting)

767
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:36,750
Pull everyone back.

768
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:38,418
Yes, sir.

769
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:41,504
Stop the search!

770
00:55:42,797 --> 00:55:44,424
We're pulling back!

771
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:52,849
(panting)

772
00:56:00,982 --> 00:56:03,902
(groaning)

773
00:56:03,985 --> 00:56:06,988
(grunting)

774
00:56:31,262 --> 00:56:32,222
(groans)

775
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:35,100
(closing theme music)

776
00:56:38,978 --> 00:56:42,315
SHADOW DETECTIVE

777
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:44,401
(closing theme music)
