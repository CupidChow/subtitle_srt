REPORTER: Geumo City recently announced
the Geumo City Five-Year Development Plan,

67
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:09,332
which will serve as a guide
for urban growth and development

68
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:10,667
over the next five years.

69
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,461
Geumo City recently launched
its first development project

70
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:16,005
by attracting
large-scale industrial complexes.

71
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:19,884
Using this as a stepping stone,
the Geumo City Five-Year Development Plan…

My name's written right there!

What's the matter now?

77
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,144
Room 405 left without paying rent.

78
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:33,231
I couldn't get hold of him for a week,
so I went to his room and it was empty.

79
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:34,732
-Try Room 308.
-Room 308?

80
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:37,443
Room 308 and Room 405
had the same sneakers.

00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:38,945
(suspenseful music)

82
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,534
GONG: Matching sneakers?

83
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:48,663
TAEKROK: Seemed to have those
matching rings, too. They were the same.

84
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:50,331
When did you even notice all that?

85
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:54,043
Hey, you can't even notice
that in this tiny place?

86
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,587
There aren't exactly
many people living here.

87
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:58,840
And you want to be a cop, with those eyes?

88
00:04:58,923 --> 00:05:00,174
You should just quit, kid.

I'm not eating it. I'm not, you punk.

92
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:09,642
REPORTER: We're planning
on continuing the conversation.

93
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:10,852
On today's News N Peoples,

94
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:13,104
we have the person in charge
of the safety of Geumo.

95
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:15,648
The chief of police at Geumo
police station, Seo Gwangsu.

96
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:18,026
-Welcome.
-Yes, hello.

97
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:22,071
I'm Seo Gwangsu, chief of police
at Geumo police station.

98
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:27,785
Geumo introduced a crime prevention system
in an attempt

99
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:32,665
to intensively inspect areas
where security is unstable,

100
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:37,712
and to make Geumo a place where citizens
can be assured of their safety.

101
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:41,215
GWANGSU: In Geumo, which has
the characteristics of a port city,

102
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:44,344
we set up a special investigation team
for drug criminality

103
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:47,764
that is becoming increasingly
more organized and intelligent.

104
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:51,309
And with strict management and response
from the get-go

105
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:54,020
we're putting
all our efforts into creating

106
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:56,147
-a drug-free city.
-MAN 2: Come here, quickly!

107
00:05:56,481 --> 00:06:00,860
REPORTER: Were there any challenges
in creating this crime prevention system?

108
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:04,906
GWANGSU: Of course, this kind of system
isn't established overnight.

109
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:09,160
However, every single member
of Geumo Police

110
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:13,623
is working hard for the safety of Guemo,

111
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:16,542
which is why we were able
to overcome those challenges.

112
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:20,254
Not only for crime prevention, but also,
the protection of victims' rights…

Hey, Officer Son! What are you doing here?

00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,064
I came down from Seoul to learn from you.

132
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,609
It's an honor
to be on the same team as you.

133
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:10,281
-Check Ma Sanggu's location again.
-Yes, sir.

-One moment.

What?

136
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:18,456
-Just a moment.
-No.

137
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,666
-Come on.
-Jeez.

138
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,091
What happened to your nose?

139
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,803
Let the kids do most of the work

140
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:34,722
Who was it?

141
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,141
Nose hair.

That nose hair punk from Wolpa-dong?

143
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:42,230
I was trimming my nose hair!

144
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:46,025
Just get yourself a nose hair trimmer.
It doesn't even cost that much.

145
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,111
So where were you the past few days?
You didn't even text me.

00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:53,115
I know I joined the force after you,
I'm still the team leader.

147
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,283
I'll write up a statement.

148
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,661
You mean a written apology.
Where were you?

149
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,747
I was at Oh's funeral.

150
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:01,165
Okay?

151
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:04,919
Detective Oh passed away? When?
I didn't hear anything about it.

152
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:07,421
He was an old man living alone.
Who could have spread the word?

Oh, dear.

Again? You want me to gather them around

The chief won't stop nagging,

Help me just this once. It's killing me.

164
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,374
make inquiries
to Tongin and Munju stations

165
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:45,167
about similar cases
and ask for cooperation.

166
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,294
It's an outsider's job.

167
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,088
Work together.
Don't hold back for your performance.

168
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:50,464
That's how you catch the suspect.

169
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:52,341
This case...

170
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:54,635
(sighs)

171
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,304
SERIAL THEFT AT HAKGIL CAFE

172
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:58,180
Wait.

173
00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:00,891
If you act rashly,
whoever did this will disappear.

174
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:03,227
-Let it sit for a bit.
-Until when?

175
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,187
How many suspects are there?

176
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:06,147
There are three.

177
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,441
Get the security footage
of the residences of all three.

178
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:11,444
Check with the crime scene station
for a month ago, and check the numbers.

179
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,029
Due to the nature of the case,

180
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,448
they must have ran
several preliminary trials for the route.

181
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:16,991
Put the guys undercover.

182
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:19,201
They'll definitely strike again.

183
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,288
Here.

184
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:23,873
What's this?

185
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,500
The Commissioner's commendation
for solving that robbery last time.

186
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:27,418
CERTIFICATE OF COMMENDATION

187
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:32,715
-What about the award money?
-There isn't any this time.

188
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:33,924
Darn it.

189
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,509
Come on, you can't just throw it away.

190
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,261
At least keep it in your drawer.

191
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,058
What's up with him?

192
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,518
Well, that's...

193
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,772
I thought you knew him well?

194
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:49,815
POLICE OFFICER PERSONNEL RECORD CARD

195
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,359
What? Know him well?

196
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:54,945
He's just a kid who assisted me
when I was dispatched to Seoul.

197
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,198
Darn, this is so annoying.

198
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,034
Taekrok.

199
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,078
What now?

200
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:06,123
Did you hear from Hyunseok at all?

201
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,002
-Hear what?
-You know...

202
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:12,797
It must not be easy,
dealing with the chief's mess.

203
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:16,050
Check on him when you can, like old times.

204
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:17,134
(clicks tongue)

205
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,095
Well...

206
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,389
He'll be fine.

207
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,769
Detective! A moment, please.

208
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,020
What, kid?

209
00:11:28,604 --> 00:11:32,024
I've trained in martial arts and built up
my courage to become a detective.

210
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,779
EP 01 MY EFFORTS TO BECOME
A HOMICIDE DETECTIVE

211
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:38,864
(light music playing)

212
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:44,662
(Kyungchan yelling)

213
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,539
That's impressive.

214
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:48,457
Ooh.
(chuckles)

215
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,294
MY DREAM OF BEING A HOMICIDE DETECTIVE

216
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,922
DON'T LOOK AROUND
AND DON'T LOOK BACK

217
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,425
"Don't look around and don't look back"?

218
00:11:57,508 --> 00:12:00,928
Yes, sir! I only look forward.
I think it's my weakness and my strength.

219
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:05,933
Huh.

220
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:11,355
-Thank you.
-Ma Sanggu?

221
00:12:11,439 --> 00:12:13,357
-At the Seongdong intersection arcade.
-Let's go.

222
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:15,359
Taekrok.

223
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,072
(sighs)

224
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,783
-You coming?
-Yes!

225
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:28,372
(suspenseful music)

226
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,128
Take my car.

227
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:36,505
(siren wailing in distance)

228
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,382
It's okay. We'll take mine.

229
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:43,262
We should hurry.

230
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:48,434
(suspenseful music)

231
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:55,858
(cell phone buzzes)

232
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:58,569
NO CALLER ID

233
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,156
We're here.

234
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,369
There, pull up to the front.

235
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:25,763
There's a guy in there called Ma Sanggu
with five previous convictions.

236
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:27,056
Here.

237
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:30,893
(clears throat)

238
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,478
TAEKROK: He delivers gas.

239
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,104
I see, delivers gas?

240
00:13:34,188 --> 00:13:35,564
He's a drug dealer.

241
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,484
Go inside and find him--

242
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:39,860
Just identify him and come out.

243
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,405
-By myself?
-He knows our faces.

244
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:48,828
Are you scared?

245
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:51,080
No, of course not.

246
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:55,000
Don't give yourself away.
He shanks cops when he's cornered.

247
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,504
-He has an attempted murder charge.
-Gosh, why...

248
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:00,172
-SUNGA: It's true.
-Attempted murder.

249
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:01,549
(Kyungchan scoffs)

250
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,926
-The life of a homicide detective...
-(honks)

251
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:04,927
Oh, dear.

252
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,059
I'll be back, sir.

253
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,937
Just let the whole world know,
why don't you?

254
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:30,119
(background chatter)

255
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:37,293
(suspenseful music)

256
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,407
-Is this your first time here?
-(gasps)

257
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:10,159
Yes.

258
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,578
-Do you want some change?
-Yes, I do.

259
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,247
(snickering)

260
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,290
How much?

261
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:19,960
Oh, it looks like I forgot my wallet.
I'll come back another time.

262
00:15:20,461 --> 00:15:22,212
We can start a tab for you.

263
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,965
-Just play one game.
-No, I'm not fond of tabs... I'm good.

264
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:27,593
Boss, do you know this guy?

265
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,470
(grunts)

266
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:31,263
He was looking at you like that?

267
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:34,350
Jeez... Darn it.

268
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:37,436
(Kyungchan grumbling)

269
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,063
(Kyungchan panting)

270
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:42,983
Hey! Why were you looking at me like that?

271
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,778
-Do you know me?
-I've never seen you in my life.

272
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:48,489
(Kyungchan panting)

273
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:49,740
(inhales sharply)

274
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:51,825
Are you a detective?

275
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:53,452
Darn it.

276
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:54,620
You're new.

277
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:56,580
I'm a homicide detective,
Son Kyungchan, darn it!

278
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,877
(men laughing)

279
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,213
(Kyungchan grunts)

280
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:07,299
SANGGU: Hey, wait. "Darn it?"

281
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,885
If you're a detective, why do you sound
so awkward when you swear?

282
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:11,971
You have no idea who I am, do you?

283
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:15,349
Gosh, your eyes.
They're so darn full of life.

284
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,978
-You want me to scratch your eyeballs?
-No.

285
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,437
-Hey, detective.
-KYUNGCHAN: No.

286
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:23,023
-SANGGU: Why are you here?
-(Kyungchan whimpering)

287
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,483
Why are you here?

288
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:26,402
-(thwacking)
-(men groaning)

289
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:27,987
Jeez, darn it!

290
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,949
(ominous music)

291
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,077
Arrest them.

292
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,370
KYUNGCHAN: Right.

293
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:37,788
Ahh.

294
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:39,790
He's one of Detective Lee's men.

295
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:42,543
We'll be carrying out
our official police duties now.

296
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:44,420
Darn, why did you show up unexpectedly?

297
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:46,213
You could have called first.

298
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:47,589
-SANGGU: Guys.
-MAN 1: Yes sir!

299
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:49,842
-(groans)
-(thuds)

00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:53,303

(Taekrok snickers)

304
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:08,902
-Long time no see.
-Yes.

305
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:12,239
Darn it.

306
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:15,451
(funky music)

307
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:24,418

(cell phone buzzing)

310
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:42,978
This old man. Why the heck is he calling
when he's already chasing me?

311
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,272
(panting)

312
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:48,108
-Yes, hello.
-Stop right there, jerk.

313
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,318
You stop first, then.

314
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,196
Okay, we'll stop together
on the count of three.

315
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:53,238
Okay.

316
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:55,365
-One
-Two.

317
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:56,784
Three.

318
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:59,870
(both panting)

319
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:02,122
SANGGU: Darn it.

320
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,625
(Sanggu gurgles, spits)

321
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:10,172
Hey, I told you to stop delivering gas.

322
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:13,008
-I'm not. Darn it.
-Who else is making the deliveries ,then?

323
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,761
-How could I sell something I don't have?
-Is it Mr. Cheon?

324
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:18,847
You get drugs from Mr. Cheon, right?

325
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,099
Where is that punk?

326
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,683
Why are you asking me about him?

327
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,728
-Hey, just give me Mr. Cheon.
-I really have no idea where he is.

328
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:25,854
I'm leaving now.

329
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,064
Hey. I told you to stop.

330
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:28,232
I told you I'm leaving.

331
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:31,110
-It's up to you to chase me if you want.
-Wait...

332
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,615
Whoa!
(groaning)

333
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:41,829
(grunts)

334
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:43,080
(groans)

335
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,290
TAEKROK: Are you okay?

336
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,334
-Sir, are you all right?
-What?

337
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:49,461
Yes, I'm fine.

338
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:50,546
That's the suspect, right?

339
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:51,630
-What?
-Do you want my help?

340
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:54,842
No, stay out of it. It's dangerous.
Hey, it's dangerous!

341
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,885
That darn...

342
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,178
Call Geumo police station!

343
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:00,055
(groans)

344
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:02,724
(lively music)

345
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:15,112
GUARD: Hey, stop! You!
Hey! Stop right there!

346
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:16,280
-I said stop!
-SANGGU: Darn!

347
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:19,283
-GUARD: Hey, stop right there!
-Why is that punk coming after me?

348
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:21,243
I said stop. Hey, hurry up.

349
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:30,419
Why are you chasing after me?

350
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:32,337
Are you a cop?

351
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:34,715
You should respect your elders,
even if you're a criminal.

352
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:36,466
What is this lunatic talking about?

353
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,760
-Get lost.
-Stop, you're going to hurt yourself.

354
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,846
I'm going to kill you, you damn idiot!

355
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:43,140
(panting)

356
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:50,606
(hissing)

357
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,567
(Sanggu groans)

358
00:19:56,445 --> 00:20:00,532
It hurts, you punk. Darn it.
(groaning)

359
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,701
SANGGU: It hurts!

360
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:04,328
(Sanggu snickers)

361
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:06,371
(Taekrok panting)

362
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:09,249
(Taekrok wheezing)

363
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:11,960
Detective, are you all right?

364
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:13,879
SANGGU: Should I call 911?

365
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:15,589
You scumbag...

366
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:17,633
(Taekrok panting)

367
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:19,301
(Taekrok gasps)

368
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:20,761
SANGGU: Ow.

369
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:23,764
-Shoot.
-Hey!

370
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:28,227
Come to Homicide at Geumo police station,
I'll give you the Brave Citizen Award.

371
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:32,689
You better hope
you don't run into me again!

372
00:20:32,773 --> 00:20:34,399
Didn't I tell you to stop, punk?

373
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,943
Where's Mr. Cheon?

374
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:40,447
I told you it's been a while
since I last saw him.

375
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,869
Hey, you really want to do this with me?

376
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:48,997
Seriously, why would I lie
when I'm already caught?

377
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:52,292
Does Woo Hyunseok
still meet with Mr. Cheon?

378
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,795
Don't mix me in with those two,
I'm serious.

379
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:57,923
I have nothing to do with them, honestly.

380
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:01,176
I really have no idea.
Really, never, none whatsoever!

381
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:10,477
Detective Na. Hello.

382
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:13,021
SANGGU: You could have said hello back.

383
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:16,942
(trills)

384
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:19,569
CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER
SUPERINTENDANT WOO HYUNSEOK

385
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:21,405
(Hyunseok sighs)

386
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:23,198
(cell phone buzzing)

387
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:28,787
-Hello.
-Where are you?

388
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,747
HYUNSEOK:
Is there nothing else besides this?

389
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:31,832
None?

390
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:33,750
Darn. Yes, Taekrok.

391
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,627
I'm in a meeting right now
so I'm kind of busy.

392
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:37,796
I said we should meet up.
Why won't you get back to me?

393
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:39,131
This isn't it.

394
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:40,257
Go look again.

395
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:42,676
I'm sorry, Taekrok.

396
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:43,844
What's up?

397
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:44,886
(sighs)

398
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:47,389
We should meet up.

399
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:49,975
I'll be in touch, for real this time.

400
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:54,563
KIM TAEKROK

401
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:02,946
(ominous music)

402
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:16,043
CHAIRMAN JANG, REDEVELOPMENT,
CONFLICT, ANNIHILATION... KIM TAEKROK

403
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:38,857
Was everyone dispatched?

404
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:41,068
-They're at the restaurant.
-Restaurant?

405
00:22:41,151 --> 00:22:44,112
The chief told everyone to gather up,
because the new section chief is here.

406
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:51,495
TRADITIONAL BEEF BONE SOUP,
SHORT RIP SOUP, OX KNEE SOUP

407
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:12,766
-Yes. All right.
-(camera shutter clicks)

408
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:17,729
-You made it.
-Yes.

409
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:25,779
Taekrok, hand over the job
to the kids and take it easy.

410
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:28,740
Retirement's not that far away
for you and me.

411
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,909
Well, then, stop nagging the kids.

412
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:32,619
(Gwangsu chuckles)

413
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:34,871
He's so...

414
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,708
Taekrok, we're still on the clock.

415
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:40,877
-I'm taking the afternoon off.
-The afternoon off?

416
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,921
Who's that commendation guy?

417
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:44,965
-SUNGA: Commendation guy?
-(cap clatters)

418
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:48,969
Now, this is Superintendent Kook Jinhan,
the new Chief Investigation Officer.

419
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:50,470
Introduce yourself.

420
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:54,808
(applause)

421
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:58,103
Hello, I'm Kook Jinhan.

422
00:23:58,186 --> 00:24:00,021
Some of you may know,

423
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:02,232
when I was at the main office,
I stood up to my superior

424
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:03,942
-and was demoted to Geumo police station.
-(scoffs)

425
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:05,819
(Gwangsu laughs)

426
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:08,155
Superintendent Kook,
you're as bold as they say.

427
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:11,783
After being assigned to Geumo,
I contemplated a lot.

428
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:15,745
I will do my best for the development
and well-being of Geumo Police.

429
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:17,539
(applause)

430
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:20,250
One thing I want to ask

431
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:23,962
is those who think
they've reached their limits

432
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:27,299
should get themselves out of the field
and into a desk job,

433
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:32,596
transfer to another office,
or take a leave of...

434
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:35,265
absence.

435
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:38,268
(chuckles)

436
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:40,479
Team Leader Bae.

437
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:47,903
Well, enjoy.

438
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:49,279
-Yes, thank you.
-Thank you, sir.

439
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:50,197
Sure!

440
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:57,954
(chairs rattling)

441
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:23,647
(background chatter)

442
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:27,442
Were you offended?

443
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,111
(scoffs)

444
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:34,366
So I guess not everyone can stand up
against the big guns.

445
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:37,035
You're one to talk.

446
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:40,205
You were demoted twice after standing up
to the former commissioners.

447
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:42,624
Which is why you're still a lieutenant.

448
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:48,046
They told me a lot about you
when I said I was coming here.

449
00:25:49,756 --> 00:25:51,091
"Get rid of the old fool?"

450
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:53,051
Something like that.

451
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,679
If I don't keep you in check,
you'll keep me in check.

452
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:57,138
(scoffs)

453
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,765
Well, you are welcome to try.

454
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,768
Unfortunately, I won't be able to help.

455
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:03,979
Too busy keeping perps in check.

456
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:12,112
(sighs)

457
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:16,491
(groaning)

458
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:20,203
This old body of mine,
even a bit of running makes my knees...

459
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:21,288
Apart from age,

460
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:25,709
I'm not going to have people below my rank
die in the line of duty before I do.

461
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:29,170
You being out of breath after running
that short distance is a nuisance.

462
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:30,839
You're crossing a line, you know.

463
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:33,425
Dying on the job is my dream!

464
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:37,220
I'm uncomfortable with older detectives
who tend to speak informally to me.

465
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:40,348
I suggest you show some respect
to your superior with the words you use.

466
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,475
If you have a problem,
take disciplinary action.

467
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,394
Or you can also speak informally.

468
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:46,980
I like being uncomfortable.

469
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,613
(tense music)

470
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,575
Why does Taekrok keep wanting to see you?

471
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:01,411
(sighs)

472
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:04,623
Is it because...

473
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,083
No, I don't think so.

474
00:27:07,584 --> 00:27:11,421
It's just that there have been a lot
of drug cases in our jurisdiction lately,

475
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:15,008
-so probably--
-Who on earth keeps distributing drugs?

476
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:18,386
Mr. Cheon isn't even around anymore.

477
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,846
I'll look into it.

478
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:21,931
(sighs)

479
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,517
Did you look into the other thing?

480
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,937
It was a burner phone.

481
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:30,273
Was there no further contact?

482
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:31,566
You're certain?

483
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:36,946
You should be careful for the time being,
until things settle down.

484
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:41,159
(sighs)

485
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:47,457
What's there to settle down?

486
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:50,251
(foreboding music)

487
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,339
Safety, of course. Safety for us all.

488
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:56,633
Have you been contacted at all?

489
00:27:57,926 --> 00:27:58,760
(knocks on door)

490
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:01,137
Yes, come in.

491
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,141
GWANGSU: Yes.

492
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:08,603
You know each other, right? Say hi.

493
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:13,692
This is Superintendent Woo Hyunseok.
The new Chief Investigation Officer.

494
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:15,443
Of course, I'm familiar.

495
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:17,237
An elite and a man of many talents.

496
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:20,365
I think you may be a bit over-qualified
for our station.

497
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:23,076
The real man of many talents is you,
Section Chief Woo.

498
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:24,869
They say you're thorough
throughout day and night.

499
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,579
(laughter)

500
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:28,915
Thorough throughout day and night?

501
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:33,128
Team Leader Bae, you can go now.

502
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:45,014
There have been rumors
that you handle your business very neatly.

503
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:46,766
(men snicker)

504
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:50,228
Recently, with the city planning,
redevelopment, and what not,

505
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:51,688
outsiders keep going in and out,

506
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:53,690
making an absolute mess out
of the jurisdiction.

507
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:55,775
It's reassuring to see the two of you.

508
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:56,943
(chuckles)

509
00:28:57,652 --> 00:28:59,738
Well, I'm just going to be following
Mr. Woo's lead.

510
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:00,780
(scoffs)

511
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:03,408
Now, what would a hillbilly like me know?

512
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:04,659
(laughs)

513
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:13,543
(classical music playing)

514
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,897
690,000 WON, 50% OFF

515
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,484
-Excuse me.
-Yes.

516
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,736
Is it half this price?

517
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:41,863
No, the discount has already been applied.

518
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:42,864
(exhales sharply)

519
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:47,368
Sir, fit is very important these days
regardless of age.

520
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:52,832
This would look great on you.
Would you like to try it on?

521
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:55,835
Please, try it on.

522
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,546
Trying on clothes is very different
from just looking at them.

523
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,340
Here, go inside and try it on.

524
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:05,386
SALESWOMAN: Oh, my.

525
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:08,807
Sir, it looks like
it was custom-made for you.

526
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,183
(chuckles)

527
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:13,728
How...
(clears throat)

528
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:16,898
-How much is this?
-It's 850,000 won.

529
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:22,237
On sale?

530
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,448
This just came in, so it's not on sale.

531
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:27,909
What is the price range you have in mind?

532
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:29,953
Around 300,000 won.

533
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:31,663
Okay, just a moment.

534
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:32,831
Okay.

535
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:40,713
This color would look better on you.
Let's try it on.

536
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:41,756
(mutters)

537
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,674
(grunts)

538
00:30:56,437 --> 00:30:59,440
Do you like the clothes but not the price?

539
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:01,150
Yes, well...
(clears throat)

540
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:03,069
No need to look at the price.

541
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:04,737
I'll buy it for you as a gift.

542
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,199
-Oh.
-(chuckles)

543
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:11,619
-How did you know I was here?
-I followed you.

544
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,538
(giggles)

545
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:15,498
Go with this one, it looks good on you.

546
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:18,877
You look nice.

547
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,044
(laughs)

548
00:31:21,129 --> 00:31:23,923
You should have gone with the one I chose.
I wanted to buy it for you.

549
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,383
It costs over 50,000 won.

550
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:27,594
It's just a consultation fee,
not a solicitation.

551
00:31:28,011 --> 00:31:30,430
-(cell phone buzzes)
-I feel sorry when I think of Jiwoo as is.

552
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:32,473
Not being able to be there,
because of work.

553
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:34,851
WOO HYUNSEOK

554
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:37,645
Yes.

555
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:40,315
Where?

556
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:42,609
Yes, okay.

557
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:47,363
Let's have dinner together.
I have something to ask you, too.

558
00:31:47,864 --> 00:31:48,948
Some other time.

559
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,534
How are you doing?

560
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:53,077
No seizures.

561
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:54,287
And the medication?

562
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,122
Well, I have some left.

563
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:58,666
Don't forget to take it, okay?

564
00:31:58,958 --> 00:31:59,792
See you next time.

565
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:09,177
(camera shutter clicking)

566
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:24,525
You seem to be in good condition
today, Chief? Even making an eagle.

567
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:27,070
-(laughs)
-You're paying for lunch today, Eagle.

568
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:31,824
Hey, it seems like just two days ago
I was popping your golf cherry.

569
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:34,118
-Popping my what?
-(snickers)

570
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:37,747
Hey, what kind of a hospital director uses
such vulgar language?

571
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:39,332
Why are you being so sensitive?

572
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:45,213
Gwangsu, I guess you've been sensitive
since you started living off my family.

573
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:46,297
When was that?

574
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:49,217
That's from when we were little kids.

575
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:52,845
Gwangsu's family used to rent
our basement.

576
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:54,222
(sucks teeth)

577
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:58,351
Now that I think about it,
you've grown quite a bit, right?

578
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:02,730
Becoming our neighborhood police chief,
golfing with us.

579
00:33:03,481 --> 00:33:08,444
Councilman, is he really going to be
nominated for the next election?

580
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:10,238
Why, of course.

581
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:14,200
Our police chief would be elected
the moment he entered the race.

582
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:16,869
And the other party is eager
to bring him in, too.

583
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:18,413
-Is that so?
-(men snicker)

584
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:22,458
Gwangsu, you're quite
the big deal now, aren't you?

585
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:24,002
(laughs)

586
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:26,295
Well, honestly, among the people here,

587
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:29,465
is there anyone who doesn't owe one
to our police chief? Anyone?

588
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:30,508
Gosh, no one.

589
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:33,594
Let me fill your glasses.
Take your hand down from his shoulder.

590
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:34,887
-Here.
-You, in particular,

591
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:38,349
got a lot of help, because you went
to school together, didn't you?

592
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:42,186
We've all helped each other for decades.

593
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:45,815
So, I decided to take this chance
and head the sponsorship

594
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:48,026
to get the police chief
into the city council.

595
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:50,445
What do you think? Is that okay?

596
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:51,821
I would be grateful.

597
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:53,448
(men chuckle)

598
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:54,407
Now...

599
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:59,203
Today, in celebration of the Chief's
entry into politics, I'll pay.

600
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:01,956
The supporters' association
has been formed today, okay?

601
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,375
Let's use the city council as a stepping
stone to the National Assembly!

602
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:06,669
-Let's go!
-(yelps)

603
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:08,921
-Nice!
-Election!

604
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:10,465
Here, let's drink to it.

605
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:12,550
-Have a drink.
-That's nice.

606
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:16,888
To the election of our police chief
to the city council!

607
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:18,806
-To his election!
-To his election!

608
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,808
(men laugh)

609
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:23,728
(birds chirping)

610
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:32,111
(cell phone buzzing)

611
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:39,327
NO CALLER ID

612
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:42,330
MALE VOICE: Stylish old friend of mine.

613
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:44,874
-Long time no speak.
-Hey, man.

614
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,418
I'm a cop, okay?

615
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:50,129
You sound too old to be prank-calling.

616
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:52,173
-Where are you going?
-What does it matter to you?

617
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:53,549
Of course, it matters.

618
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:54,926
Let me put it bluntly.

619
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:56,803
Don't go, you'll regret it if you go.

620
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:58,638
-Is that a threat?
-It's a start.

621
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:01,933
This is fun, being threatened at this age.
I look forward to it.

622
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,519
Go home, shower, and go to bed.

623
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:05,603
I mean it.

624
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:09,148
Hey, if you keep calling me I'm going to
trace your number and you'll be sorry.

625
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:10,608
Hang up.

626
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:13,152
The older you get,
the more stubborn you become.

627
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:14,403
I'll call back later.

628
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,656
Don't be startled.

629
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:18,324
-Brace yourself.
-(line beeps)

630
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:49,897
MOKRO TAVERN

631
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:58,698
TAEKROK: When did you get here?

632
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,241
HYUNSEOK: I just got here.

633
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:02,660
-TAEKROK: Hello.
-HYUNSEOK: Hi.

634
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:05,746
(Taekrok clears throat)

635
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:09,041
What are you two doing here?
I thought you were dead.

636
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:11,794
I see you're still alive, too.

637
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:15,131
You fool. I'm going to outlive you.

638
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,010
Did you two fight?

639
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:20,303
Why are you sulking?

640
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:22,722
What do you mean fight?
We're too old for that.

641
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:25,600
Don't be silly, you punks.

642
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:28,978
Don't say you're old
when I'm standing right in front of you.

643
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:34,066
She's still the same.

644
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,321
We haven't been here
since you became team leader, right?

645
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:39,947
I guess so.

646
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:41,449
Time flies.

647
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:46,162
(humming)

648
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:49,290
DETECTIVE 1: Hey,
isn't that Section Chief Woo?

649
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:51,167
-Who? And that's Detective Kim.
-Right?

650
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:53,252
They drink together?

651
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:56,005
Gosh, it's been a while
since I've seen them together.

652
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:57,798
Are they close?

653
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,508
-Yes.
-No, they can't be.

654
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:01,761
They were really close back in the day.

655
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:04,180
So, what, do you want
to go somewhere else?

656
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:06,057
-Yes, let's go somewhere else.
-Okay.

657
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:29,455
(grunting)

658
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:31,582
Gosh, that's bitter.

659
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:39,590
The old days were good, Taekrok.

660
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:42,260
They can be good again.

661
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:45,471
Where's Mr. Cheon?

662
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:50,309
Hey, I said no drugs, didn't I?

663
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:51,602
Who is it?

664
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:54,730
Behind you? Is it Woo Hyunseok?

665
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:55,773
What?

666
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,192
-That was abrupt.
-Ma Sanggu is getting drugs

667
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,485
from Mr. Cheon, right?

668
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:02,863
And you're covering for them?

669
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:06,409
Where's Mr. Cheon?

670
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:10,037
Hey, Section Chief Woo.

671
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:12,290
Kim Taekrok, that old man.

672
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:14,333
Why is he so eager to get me?

673
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:15,710
Cover for me.

674
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:18,421
Before I kill you.

675
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:20,548
Got it?

676
00:38:24,885 --> 00:38:27,179
Are you saying I'm involved with drugs?

677
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:29,557
When I know how much
you hate the idea, why--

678
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,558
You.

679
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:33,102
Police Chief Seo, Mr. Cheon.

680
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:36,272
Should I look into the relationship
between you three?

681
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,149
Hm?

682
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:40,401
Turn things upside down again?

683
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:41,652
Look into what?

684
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:43,821
Turn what upside down?

685
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:47,533
I'm done with Mr. Cheon for good.
He left the country.

686
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:49,618
Who knows if he left, hid, or was hidden?

687
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:53,998
(Hyunseok sighs)

688
00:38:54,081 --> 00:38:56,375
Taekrok, I'm telling you.

689
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:00,629
Mr. Cheon, he's irrelevant.

690
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:04,633
And that's not what's important right now.

691
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:07,011
Then what is important?

692
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,221
What are you trying to say?

693
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:12,892
Well...

694
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:18,564
(scoffs)

695
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:22,943
(sighs)

696
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:25,029
(inhales deeply)

697
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:30,242
Hyunseok, listen to me.

698
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:32,703
For the last time.

699
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,790
I'll take care of everything.

700
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:37,625
You can't do this alone.

701
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:40,503
Right?

702
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:48,135
(scoffs)

703
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,846
Gosh, he's driving me crazy...

704
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:55,935
Can you really handle it?

705
00:39:56,018 --> 00:39:57,228
I can.

706
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:01,774
Then...

707
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:06,487
(cell phone buzzing)

708
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,240
(sighs)

709
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:14,036
To begin, order the frozen pollack stew
that we used to have all the time.

710
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:20,292
-(snickers)
-(door opens, closes)

711
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:24,380
Ma'am, one frozen pollack stew, please.

712
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:26,507
With a lot of chili peppers.

713
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:36,183
NOEUL GOSIWON

714
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:39,270
NOEUL GOSIWON ENTRANCE

715
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:41,355
(tense music)

716
00:41:18,058 --> 00:41:18,976
Aah.

717
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:20,644
Thank you.

718
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:30,196
(sighs)

719
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:36,035
Taekrok, let's meet again tomorrow.

720
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:37,995
I swear I'll tell you everything.

721
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:40,080
It'll all be over tomorrow.

722
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:43,417
(tense music)

723
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:04,939
(classical music playing)

724
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:07,983
(sighs)

725
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:11,153
(breathes deeply)

726
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:26,835
TO KIM TAEKROK, SHIN JUNGAE

727
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:52,361
I don't have pictures of her
after elementary school.

728
00:43:30,232 --> 00:43:32,234
(music fades)

729
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:46,290
Hey.

730
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:50,544
Who's next door to me?

731
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:51,545
Next door?

732
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:53,505
He's new, right?

733
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:55,924
Yes, it's been a few days.
What's this about?

734
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:57,134
How long?

735
00:43:57,426 --> 00:43:59,011
I guess maybe a week?

736
00:43:59,094 --> 00:43:59,928
Who is it?

737
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:02,014
What's this about? Is he loud?

738
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:03,223
No.

739
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:04,850
He's too quiet.

740
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:06,101
(sighs)

741
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:10,189
-Give me his application for admission.
-No, it's private information.

742
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:12,191
You punk. Go to the restroom.

743
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:14,860
TAEKROK: Hurry.

744
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:21,200
APPLICATION FOR ADMISSION

745
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:29,541
NAME: YANG KITAE

746
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:31,502
Yang Kitae?

747
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:37,216
(foreboding music)

748
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:42,388
Yang Kitae.

749
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:45,307
Yang Kitae.

750
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:48,394
Yang Kitae.

751
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:50,104
Yang Kitae.

752
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:55,693
ARSON ATTACK, YANG KITAE

753
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:08,914
Come out! Aren't you going to come out?
I'm going to break the door!

754
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:10,457
What are you doing?

755
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:13,210
-Bring me the key to this room.
-This is crazy.

756
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:15,045
If you don't bring it, I'll bust in.

757
00:45:15,754 --> 00:45:16,755
(lock clanks)

758
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:18,841
(doorknob squeaks)

759
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:21,719
(suspenseful music)

760
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:33,647
What are you? Tell me.

761
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:35,190
You still have your sentence left.

762
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:36,358
It's been a while since I got out.

763
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:38,360
Exceptional grades
in correctional education.

764
00:45:38,444 --> 00:45:40,320
My reformation and rehabilitation
are great.

765
00:45:43,782 --> 00:45:46,952
Relax your eyes. I'm a model prisoner
that the government recognizes.

766
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:52,374
Do you still think I'm the real culprit
in the arson attack?

767
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:55,753
(scoffs)

768
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,216
The victim pointed you out, man.

769
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,135
The circumstances and evidence
say you did it.

770
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:05,596
I've been framed. That was all staged.

771
00:46:05,679 --> 00:46:07,181
By who, you idiot?

772
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:10,601
Someone must have staged it.

773
00:46:12,728 --> 00:46:13,729
It's not you.

774
00:46:15,522 --> 00:46:16,774
Right?

775
00:46:17,399 --> 00:46:18,484
It really wasn't me.

776
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:20,861
You went on about being framed
for the theft case, too.

777
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:22,738
That...

778
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:23,822
(scoffs)

779
00:46:24,656 --> 00:46:27,075
Okay, let's say I did that.
But the arson really wasn't me.

780
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:29,411
What could I possibly get out
of that homeless guy?

781
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:34,416
Did you come here knowing I was here?

782
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:38,587
-Yes.
-Why?

783
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:44,259
Because I have to live, too.

784
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:47,513
(scoffs)

785
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:51,058
What do you want?

786
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:52,643
Well, you'll see.

787
00:46:57,564 --> 00:46:58,941
-Move out.
-No.

788
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:01,276
Not until I clear my name.

789
00:47:04,571 --> 00:47:05,781
Don't eavesdrop.

790
00:47:05,864 --> 00:47:09,326
I just hear things.
How is it worse than a jail cell here?

791
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:10,661
And you.

792
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,455
Don't knock on the wall.

793
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:15,958
Answer your phone right away.

794
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:18,502
It's all like that here, you jerk.

795
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:22,214
Yes, sure. We're neighbors now,
so I'll just try and ignore the noise!

796

Hey.

807
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:02,022
I'm going to trace your number tomorrow.

808
00:49:02,522 --> 00:49:03,815
I'll see you at the station.

809
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:06,318
