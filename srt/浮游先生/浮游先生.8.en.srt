00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:28,194
You'll be lonely for the rest of your life

5
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:31,656
and die alone on some street somewhere.

6
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:37,412
That's my dream.

[Ju-ri] You did it for her?

Was it because she's been talking
nonstop about wanting to be a mom,

18

start a family?

19
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:39,641
You think I made her,

20
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:41,643
what, leave because I love her?

21

- No, <i>Bong-suk-a.</i>

Why let them go?

- Some people do that.
- No.

25
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:54,072
Love and attachment are proportional.

26
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:56,491
You let someone go
because you don't love them.

27
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:58,618
When you don't care, you don't hold on.

We met a few times at his place.

Come on.

Am I alone here?

71
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,988
Stop imposing on your landlady.
You should stop bothering her.

00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:01,552
I'm not bothered. He's in my arms
when he's not in the streets.

old enough to be your <i>eomma.</i>

- Come on, let's leave.
- Yeah, right.

We're only 12 years apart.
You're one to talk.

77
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,543
You almost married a man
old enough to be your <i>appa.</i>

78
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:15,588
[Jae-mi] Hey, you told her about that?

79
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,382
We talk about all kinds of things.

[Jae-mi] Hey, is your nose okay?

92
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,428
I hope that it doesn't get infected.

93
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:05,805
Should we get you something for it?

94
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:11,728
Listen, I searched all over for you,

95
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:15,148
and when I finally found you
and saw you in there like that,

96
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,231
I lost my shit.

97
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:20,193
Get in.

Why'd you bring that back
if you're acting like this?

107
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,863
[Seung-hyeok] You said
you wanted to cherish it

108
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,277
because it'd been thrown away,
so I gave it back to you.

109
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:03,445
Here.

110
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:07,908
Is that all?

111
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,494
What else is there to it?

112
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,955
You were worried about me
and were missing me like crazy.

113
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,351
You brought my shoe
as an excuse to come all the way there.

114
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,502
- I know you, okay?
- No. You're wrong.

115
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:21,047
If I was so worried
and missing you like crazy,

116
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:23,341
do you think I would've waited
two weeks to show up,

117
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:25,218
drop off the shoe and leave like that?

118
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:27,929
I'd jump over the walls,
carrying you on my back out of there.

119
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:29,931
Don't you think?

120
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:32,600
All I did was return something.

121
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,561
Why are you putting more meaning into it?

122
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,200
So please, Jae-mi-ya.

123
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,703
Don't confuse my kindness
for romance, all right?

124
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:55,123
You're coming off desperate.

125

And it makes you look fucking easy.

You're right.

00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:06,134
I'm an easy girl
who's desperate for your love.

128
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:08,594
That's why I've been falling
for all of your tricks

129
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,471
and letting you drag me everywhere.

130
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,181
I even followed you here like an idiot.

131
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:15,977
Because I'm in love with you, all right?
I missed you so much that I could die.

Who cares?

00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:22,692
So, I'm easy.

We do have fun when we're together,
but we've always had bad luck.

I mean, you were stabbed on an island.

- That was an accident.
- [Seung-hyeok] Exactly. Do you know why?

in the universe together.

Take her and you both fuck off.

912
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:54,509
It's obviously been a waste.

913

- I'm unappreciated.
- You've been so good.

914

All right, we're good now. Okay.

- Yeah.
- [gasps]

958

They all switched
from one partner to another,

trying all sorts of crap
to figure it all out.

960

They ended up with seven children

I won't get married.

00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:46,056
Why?

967

Between someone
who has 100% useless parents

968
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:53,355
and someone who has a .01% chance
of a billionaire parent one day,

who do you think is better off?

970
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:57,525
The one with the billionaire parent.

971
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:00,504
But that chance is lower
than getting struck by lightning.

972
00:54:00,528 --> 00:54:01,529
You're right.

973
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:05,784
But I think I might
get struck by that lightning.

974
00:54:05,867 --> 00:54:07,577
Why are you saying that?
