176
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,093
She's, what, ten or eleven?

177
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,178
- Eleven.

178
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:34,096
Ow! Shit!

179
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,640
This is exactly why I said

180
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:39,143
to make a post about us not taking
runway or missing persons cases.

181
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:40,144
[sighs] Shit.

182
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:41,604
- "Shit"?
- Yeah.

183
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,523
Because it doesn't make sense!

184
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:47,902
A missing person? It's easy and rewarding.
It's good money, so why not?

185
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:50,947
Why turn away a gold mine?
It's just bad business, dude.

186
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:54,325
- Hey, don't talk to me that way.
- I could kill you right now, man.

187
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:55,909
- Kill?
- Yeah.

188
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:57,712
You're treating me
like I'm younger than you.

189
00:08:57,745 --> 00:09:00,248
Show me your ID
and prove to me that I'm not older.

190
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:09,048
You're that desperate to be making money
from a boss who's younger than you are?

191
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,551
Fine, I'll be your <i>dongsaeng.</i>

You want to know why I don't take
missing persons cases? Simple.

196
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:25,398
If a parent loses their child,

197
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:27,942
it's the parent's job
to find out where they've gone.

198
00:09:28,025 --> 00:09:31,487
If the kid chooses to run away from home,
then we should respect their decision.

199
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,866
In other words, there is zero reason
for us to get involved.

200

201
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:38,077

204

That was funny, huh?

Funny? I think it's boring.

Hitting me, breaking things,

261
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:47,183
followed by death threats
if I don't do as I'm told.

262
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:50,728
Think that'd work?

263
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:53,814
As long as it's not murder,
I heard you'll do it all.

264

That's why you're called Hae-jo.

that's too bad.

00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,933
I wasn't planning
on a cliché threat to work anyhow.

276
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:33,896
I wanted to leave a strong impression,
so I went a little overboard.

Sometimes, clichés do work, though.

I want you to do it at my wedding.

- The concept?
- A classic.

284
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,382
I've just told you.
You can steal me from my wedding.

285
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:06,136
That'd be fun.

286
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:10,850
This isn't about how fun it sounds, okay?
This job is way too dangerous.

287
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,726
I looked into that crazy lady, and...

288
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,313
If you take this job,

289
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:19,149
you're going to be lucky
if you walk away in one piece.

290
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,442
Except I'm not scared.

291
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,862
- You could get your head chopped off...
- Ow! Hey!

292
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:26,949
"Fun" doesn't pay bills.
"Fun" is just a bastard, you know?

"Fun's" not a bastard.

Oh, I think it's a perfect fit.

00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:46,594
I've never seen a family ring
passed down for 500 years.

the head family of a respected clan.

But it doesn't have diamonds or anything.

daughter-in-law anyway, probably.

the amazing gift
she's about to bring to the family

310
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:16,790
is much more precious
than the generational ring.

She rolled away just before the crash.

Four, five...

573
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:31,566
[doctor] Look here,
these are blood vessels in your brain

574
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:34,110
that seem to have
knotted up in deformed ways.

575
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:36,488
That's why they look like tangled skeins.

576
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:37,906
- Deformed?
- [doctor] Yes.

577
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:40,492
Untreated, they'll reduce
blood flow to the brain,

578
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:43,119
resulting in less oxygen
reaching the brain cells.

579
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:46,623
Naturally, the intracranial pressure
will continue to rise, and eventually...

580
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:47,791
They'll explode.

581
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:50,293

It's not common.

587
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:07,811
But due to high stress levels
and hormonal imbalances...

588
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:09,104
Ah! No.

589
00:28:10,105 --> 00:28:14,025

Right, fine. Uh...

598
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:36,297
So let's say that it can happen to others
because of hormonal imbalance,

599
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,508
or bad eating habits,
sleep deprivation, so on.

600
00:28:38,591 --> 00:28:40,677
Not me, though. This can't be happening.

[Seung-hyeok] Hmm.

620

Even though I don't have
parents or siblings,

627
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:57,712
I inherited their diseases instead.

628
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:00,173
And it's a ticking time bomb at that.

You really lied to his family
for their permission to get married?

00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:12,310
It was his idea.

633
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:13,770
[doctor] It doesn't matter!

it's too late for medication.

<i>an artisan chef who globalized
traditional Korean cuisine</i>

877
00:43:46,832 --> 00:43:49,251
[woman] Over here. Bring it here.

878
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:52,921
- Hello.
- Oh, hello.

879
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:57,092
[woman over speaker] <i>...olfactory sense,

880

<i>to each and every dish

881
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:05,476
Goodness! I wondered
who was making all that racket.

882
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:07,101
<i>Eomeoni.</i>

883
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:08,686
Here, watch.

884
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:12,358
Hold it like this and slice diagonally.

885
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:14,652
- Relax your wrist, breathe.
- [inhales and exhales]

886
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:16,528
Good. Try on your own.

887
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:19,990
Wrong. Again.

888
00:44:21,992 --> 00:44:23,494
Oh my goodness.

889
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,747
What are you even doing?

890
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,248
You're really that inept?

891
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:30,750
Ah!

892
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:32,961
[gasps]

893
00:44:33,045 --> 00:44:34,380
[Gal-ja] Oh, no!

894
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:37,675
She can't even hold a knife properly.
Who brought her into my kitchen?

895
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:39,718
[Gal-ja] Well, goodness, <i>Hyung-nim.</i>

896
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:42,554
We've been prepping
for the wedding for three days.

897
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:45,766
I'd even go and ask a five-year-old
for help at this point.

898
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:49,978
She felt bad knowing that the feast
is usually prepared by the bride's family

899
00:44:50,062 --> 00:44:51,480
and wanted to help out too.

900
00:44:51,563 --> 00:44:53,649
She's right. I volunteered.

901
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:55,609
I am supposed to prepare the food,

902
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:58,112
but you kindly insisted
on taking care of it all.

903
00:44:58,195 --> 00:44:59,195
[Ho-ja] What, then?

904
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:03,242
Should I have expected you to prepare food
for 600 relatives all on your own,

905
00:45:03,325 --> 00:45:06,120
knowing that you've grown up
practically all by yourself?

906
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:08,497
[Gal-ja] Her wedding is coming up.

907
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:10,666
Don't be so harsh on her
right before tomorrow.

908
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:14,420
That's why I'm bringing all of this up!
Seeing blood before then is bad luck!

909
00:45:16,004 --> 00:45:17,715
[indistinct murmuring]

910
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:23,429
- [gasps] Oh!
- [Ho-ja] Here.

911
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:27,307
When you're in the kitchen,
you're surrounded by hot oil,

912
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:28,809
knives and fire.

913
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:32,646
If you're not careful,
you could get hurt worse or even die.

914
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:34,815
You shouldn't come in here.

915
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:37,276
Especially not while you're pregnant.

916
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:38,777
Okay?

917
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:39,903
Goodness.

918
00:45:39,987 --> 00:45:42,322
Start using your head. And be careful.

919
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:49,413
All right.

920
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:51,415
[sighs]

921
00:45:51,957 --> 00:45:53,959
You've been looking pale and not eating,

922
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:56,962
so I went all the way to Sillim-dong
to get this for you.

923
00:45:57,546 --> 00:45:58,546
Try it.

924
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:00,549
It's from a famous place.

925
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:13,520
[Gi-ho slurping]

926
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:15,105
- [Gi-ho] Mm.
- Yuck.

927
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:18,525
You don't like <i>patjuk?</i>

928
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:21,487
- I don't like you.
- You treat me like this after all that?

929
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:22,738
More for me, then.

930
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:24,656

945
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:04,738
What? Was my joke that funny?

946
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:08,826
It said, "Full of a father's love,
wanting only the best for his child."

947
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:10,244
Isn't that hilarious?

948
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:14,498
"Wanting only the best for his child."
So why did I get nothing but bombs?

I'm suddenly so pissed.

955
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:28,011
What's wrong? You're scaring me.

956
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,390
Where are you going?

957
00:47:31,473 --> 00:47:33,100
- To meet Darth Vader.
- Huh?

958
00:47:33,767 --> 00:47:36,144
That bastard brought me
into this shitty world,

959
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:38,772
so it's only fair that I at least
see his face before I die.

960
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:41,275
What the hell are you saying?
You were sleeping a second ago.

961
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:43,110
- Listen, you're fired.
- What?

962
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:45,737
Your severance is the money
you made from your secret gigs,

963
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:47,421
so go and sell everything in the office.

964
00:47:47,447 --> 00:47:48,949
That's your pay this month.

965
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:52,452

00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:16,019
What Chinese characters
do you use for your name?

971
00:48:16,059 --> 00:48:17,936
"Jae" is "talent,"
and "mi" is for "taste."

972
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:19,897
"Taste-making talent."
Which is really cool.

973
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:21,064
[women] Oh!

974
00:48:21,148 --> 00:48:23,692
[Jae-mi] Your name
determines your destiny. Must be true.

975
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:26,612
[woman] By the way, I hear that you work
in the food industry too.

976
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:29,364
What do you do? Korean food? Western food?

977
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:30,741
Snacks.

978
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:34,161
I used to prepare snacks
at a day care center,

979
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:35,829
but got fired because I sucked.

980
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:37,414
[laughs] Oh, that's...

982
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:39,708
Oh, look at that.

983
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:42,961
When did you have time to prepare
these handwritten cards?

984
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:45,005
There must be
hundreds of them you've done.

985
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:47,299
That's so sweet and thoughtful of you.

986
00:48:47,382 --> 00:48:48,383
[laughing]

987
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:52,179
I'm not bringing a dowry with me,
so I should at least do this.

988
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:53,722
What are you talking about?

989
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:56,125
You're bringing the most precious
dowry anyone could bring.

990
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:58,101
[woman] You saw what happened
in the kitchen.

991
00:48:58,185 --> 00:49:00,812
Bum Ho-ja <i>yeosa-nim</i>
doesn't care about anyone

992
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:04,316
except her precious
daughter-in-law and her baby.

993
00:49:04,399 --> 00:49:06,526
That's all she cares about. Her bloodline.

994
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:07,444
[all laugh]

995
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:10,822
It's because she had a hard time
conceiving the eldest son,

996
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:12,449
so please understand.

997
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:14,868
But I can assure you,

998
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:19,039
she'll protect that baby and you
with her whole life, you see?

999
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:21,249
- So don't you worry about a thing.
- [all chuckle]

1000
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:22,709
- That's right.
- Okay.

1001
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:24,002
[woman] Your little one.

1002
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:26,296
Of course she'll love
her grandchild to bits.

1003
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:39,767

1004
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:43,105
[groans]

1005
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:48,110
Should I go back to Seoul and give up?

1006
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:52,781
[sighs]

1007
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:57,494
Darn it.

1008
00:49:58,787 --> 00:49:59,955
It's incredible.

1009
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:05,043
Oh God!

1010
00:50:05,627 --> 00:50:07,004
What a mess!

00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:09,673

Um...

1020
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:26,857
I was going to let you go
in one piece for my son's sake,

1021
00:50:26,940 --> 00:50:28,817
but only if you came clean
before the wedding.

00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:31,611
But you didn't budge!
You deceptive little liar!

1023

How dare you do this!

1024
00:50:33,947 --> 00:50:35,490
- Get out of my house!
- Oh!
