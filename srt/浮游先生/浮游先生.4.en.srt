1
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:25,775
HEUNG'S KITCHEN, HOUSE OF OHJUK

2
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:32,365
He's in there. Over there.

3
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:34,075
Oh, no.

4
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:38,288
There goes the dignity of our clan’s heir.

5
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:40,874
I can't believe how stubborn he is.

6
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:44,627
Are you trying to kill yourself?
Get up right now!

7
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:49,591
Goodness, Ho-ja. At this rate,
he’ll die before he even gets married.

8
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:54,471
He's been begging for two days,
barely dressed and refusing to eat.

9
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,514
Why not just let him marry--

10
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:57,432
Quiet!

11
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:01,686
You called off a wedding
we spent two years planning

12
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,106
all for a girl
you've been seeing for two months.

13
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:08,151
And now you dare pull a stunt like this?

14
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:11,821
If you're going to abandon
your duties and honor like this,

15
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:14,074
you may as well take everything off!

16
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,916
You fool! How dare you?

17
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:31,925
Are you all right?

18
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:34,552
For God's sake!

19
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:36,846
You can't take off your underwear!

20
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:41,184
Why did you come? This is embarrassing.

21
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:45,313
-Who told <i>her </i>to come?
-I couldn't possibly guess.

22
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:47,649
Don't just stand there!

23
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:49,984
Get her out of here right this instant!

24
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:56,908
-Goodness, they're in big trouble now.
-Give up already.

25
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,370
You'll never win against her.

26
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:04,582
I may have never won,

27
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,836
but I've never given up first either.

28
00:02:09,504 --> 00:02:11,214
So just promise me

29
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:13,133
that you'll never

30
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:16,594
let go of my hand.

31
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,154
Heung, open your eyes!

32
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:35,905
Heung!

33
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,616
What am I going to do? Heung!

34
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:49,711
That little…

35
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:52,630
Jae-mi is pregnant with my child, Mother!

36
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,554
-She's pregnant?
-What a moron.

37
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:11,900
<i>What if they find out?</i>

38
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:14,402
<i>That you're not actually pregnant.</i>

39
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:18,281
<i>How can you be pregnant</i>
<i>when you're in menopause?</i>

40
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:22,952
<i>Do you want to have</i>
<i>as many babies as possible, boys or girls,</i>

41
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:26,915
<i>and set the Guinness World Record</i>
<i>for having the most children?</i>

42
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:28,708
<i>I know I can do it.</i>

43
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:32,378
<i>And will he still love you?</i>
<i>Even if you end his bloodline?</i>

44
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:39,862
There you go.

45
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:43,074
Sir, are you okay?

46
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:45,660
Can you hear me, sir? What's your name?

47
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:51,958
Forgive me.

48
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:55,628
I…

49
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:01,551
I'm not sure if I can hold onto your hand.

50
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:05,138
I'm sorry.

51
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:29,954
What did you mean by that?

52
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:33,916
"You're all mine"?

53
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,710
No. Before that.

54
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:40,923
-"I'm never letting go of your hand"?
-Before that.

55
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,054
"I'll die."

56
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:47,722
What did you mean by that?

57
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:53,394
I meant that I'll gladly leave your life
if that makes you happy.

58
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:58,941
For good?

59
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,278
Yes, for good.

60
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:03,696
Pinky promise?

61
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:10,703
-Off you go, then.
-Go where?

62
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,246
-To hell.
-What?

63
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:17,168
Damn, that's cold.

64
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:20,254
-Hey!
-Listen up.

65
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:22,715
A piece of advice in case you survive.

66
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:26,302
In the wild, the sneaky cowards win!

67
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,429
You got that, you idiot?

68
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:33,226
Man, she's a real nutjob.

69
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:46,280
Why is my life getting so fun
just as it's about to end?

70
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:48,783
It's making me want to live.

71
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,797
MR. PLANKTON

72
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:22,024
NAMWON POLICE

73
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:46,424
PAYPHONE

74
00:07:57,518 --> 00:07:58,644
MOTHER

75
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,813
Well, I'm off now.

76
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,899
Wait a minute. Chief. Please, sir.

77
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,609
What's the matter now?

78
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:07,653
You said he left his car behind.

79
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:11,199
You might find something
if you run his prints or license number.

80
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,617
I know that.

81
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,203
I'll let you know if we have any updates.

82
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:16,871
-Please be patient.
-Please.

83
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:17,914
-Wait.
-Seriously?

84
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,874
-I'm just frustrated.
-Are you now?

85
00:08:19,957 --> 00:08:21,584
How do you think I feel then?

86
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:24,712
And where is this person
who's supposed to be picking you up?

87
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:26,964
-Well, that's--
-Answer it.

88
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:30,718
I'd better get going. See you.

89
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:42,647
Hi, Mother. I'm sorry. My battery is low.

90
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:44,982
<i>I can't talk for long anyway.</i>

91
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,567
-Good night, sir.
-Jae-mi?

92
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:49,195
-Jae-mi!
-Jae-mi? It's her?

93
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:51,447
-It's Jae-mi.
-Jae-mi, where are you?

94
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,700
Where are you? Are you okay? Are you hurt?

95
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:58,037
Here, can you track her? Please track her.

96
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,706
Jae-mi, where are you?

97
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:04,502
<i>I'll come and get you right away.</i>

98
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:06,003
I'm scared.

99
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,552
It's getting harder to find my way back.

100
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,971
<i>Are you locked up?</i>

101
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:16,973
Did that bastard lock you up?

102
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,057
No, he didn't.

103
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,978
I just feel so hopeless right now.

104
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,690
Even if you do find me,

105
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,736
I'm too scared to face the consequences.

106
00:09:31,362 --> 00:09:34,574
You won't have to. This isn't your fault.

107
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:35,992
I lied.

108
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:42,456
To your mother and all your family.

109
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,293
I lied to every one of them.

110
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:48,504
I'm the one who lied
about you being pregnant.

111
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:53,384
<i>I'll take care of everything. Don't worry.</i>

112
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:55,970
<i>Just tell me where you are.</i>

113
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,889
<i>I'll come get you. Jae-mi? Are you there?</i>

114
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,433
Hang up now.

115
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:02,018
Did that bastard just--

116
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:04,729
Hello?

117
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,941
No, I lost her! Jae-mi!

118
00:10:09,025 --> 00:10:10,151
What on earth?

119
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:13,195
This is the pay phone right outside.

120
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,989
-Yes, right there.
-Exactly.

121
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:16,073
Jae-mi!

122
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:20,077
Jae-mi!

123
00:10:21,662 --> 00:10:22,830
Jae-mi.

124
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:27,293
Jae-mi.

125
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:28,836
Jae-mi!

126
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,839
Jae-mi.

127
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:36,594
I'll kill that bastard
if he lays a finger on her.

128
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:37,928
Jae-mi!

129
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,931
Jae-mi!

130
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:43,559
Jae-mi!

131
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,482
They say being cursed at
extends your life.

132
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,027
With all the curses I've had spewed at me,

133
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,990
shouldn't I get to live
for, like, a gazillion years?

134
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:10,086
THREE-WAY JUNCTION NOODLES

135
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,345
Have some. You haven't eaten all day.

136
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:27,603
That will burn a hole
in your empty stomach.

137
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,523
Eat up. It'll go down easier.

138
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,946
Old ladies can really cook, huh?

139
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,156
What's that? Did you want more rice?

140
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,034
I said it's delicious. God bless you.

141
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:46,807
What is it?

142
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:48,726
Your chest.

143
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,398
You got food on your dress there.

144
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,070
Take some wet wipes.

145
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,073
When did this happen?

146
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:08,245
I'm glad you're still
the same old Jo Jae-mi.

147
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:15,544
You're still just as high-maintenance,
clumsy, and hot-tempered as I remembered.

148
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:20,674
You may act tough,
but you're too soft to be truly brazen.

149
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:26,222
You really don't know me at all.
You never did.

150
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:31,435
I've been more than just brazen.

151
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,315
I've been as bold as brass.

152
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,527
I guess that brass got rusty.

153
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:45,449
If you were as bold as you say you are,

154
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:48,285
you wouldn't have hidden earlier.

155
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,496
Premature menopause?

156
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:51,914
Who gives a damn?

157
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:53,624
An important family? Big deal.

158
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:57,211
What's the point
of a long bloodline anyway?

159
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:00,840
Forget it.

160
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:06,136
If you really were as bold as brass,
you'd have run into his arms and said,

161
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,974
"I'm going to live
happily ever after with this man."

162
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:11,809
You said it yourself.

163
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,271
Your happiness comes first.

164
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,774
So why be such a wuss?

165
00:14:24,655 --> 00:14:26,740
Because I don't think I will be happy.

166
00:14:40,838 --> 00:14:43,883
I guess marrying
into such a respected family

167
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:48,137
ought to sort out my messed-up life.

168
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:54,351
By taking all that he has to give,
I'd finally feel whole.

169
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,980
If that's happiness, I should enjoy it.

170
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:01,817
But…

171
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,487
I might just end up…

172
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,326
taking away

173
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:12,703
all of his happiness.

174
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,836
What if I marry him to be happy

175
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,839
yet end up becoming
the source of <i>his </i>misery?

176
00:15:24,965 --> 00:15:28,510
I might end up
destroying him and his family.

177
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,806
I might end up

178
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:36,727
burning his family tree to the ground.

179
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,773
And the thought terrifies me.

180
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:56,080
I don't ever want to be
the seed of anyone's misery.

181
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:01,877
"Seed of misery"?

182
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,592
Some of us are just born that way.

183
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,636
Who?

184
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:12,972
Just someone. Number 137.

185
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:22,523
Yes.

186
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:26,944
Thank you for everything
that you've done, Chief.

187
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:30,114
Of course. You needn't worry about him.

188
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:32,825
He's usually
very strait-laced and responsible.

189
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:36,704
He'll never get into
this kind of trouble again.

190
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:39,206
You're so wrong about me!

191
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:42,918
I guess you thought
I was some dumb pushover.

192
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:44,670
-Hey, stop him.
-Bring it on.

193
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:46,213
Let's do this. Come on!

194
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:48,841
Please. Have a seat--

195
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:50,801
Get your hands off me! No!

196
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:55,514
That bastard stole my bride
right out from under me yet again.

197
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:58,308
-I've got nothing to lose now.
-I understand.

198
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:00,728
No real man
would ever put up with that shit!

199
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:02,146
-Go for it!
-Show them!

200
00:17:02,229 --> 00:17:03,647
You misjudged me!

201
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:07,818
That's enough already.

202
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:11,780
This is a family matter.
We will handle it ourselves.

203
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,408
We can't keep you
from your official duties.

204
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,869
This is obstruction of justice!

205
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:21,081
Why don't you talk about justice
once you've actually served it?

206
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:23,751
-For God's sake.
-Heung! Don't let go, man!

207
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:25,419
Keep a tight grip on it!

208
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:29,798
Just do something.
Put him on some kind of wanted list.

209
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,384
Or else I'm not going anywhere.

210
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:34,428
I won't take a single step--

211
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:39,183
Wait, who are… Who are you?

212
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:42,227
Hey, put me down. Please put me down!

213
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:43,395
Fetch his clothes.

214
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:48,817
Hey, no!

215
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:52,237
That was so badass.

216
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,907
Do you have someone else
you're counting on?

217
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:59,912
You're going to handle it yourself
without the police?

218
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,418
A woman about to join
a prestigious family,

219
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,754
a Korean food dynasty,

220
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,674
gets kidnapped by some thug
on her wedding day,

221
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:19,473
and she happens to be with child.

222
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:22,309
Can you imagine?

223
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,522
Journalists would have a field day.

224
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:29,650
They'd probably say
that punk did all kinds of things to…

225
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:33,320
People will believe anything these days.

226
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:36,740
Nothing good will come from making a fuss.

227
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:40,953
If anything needs
to be buried or disposed of,

228
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:43,163
I'll do it myself quietly.

229
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:57,052
Feeling hopeless?

230
00:18:58,929 --> 00:18:59,888
A little.

231
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:06,103
It feels like I've been running
towards the finish line forever.

232
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:09,398
And just as I get there, it disappears.

233
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,986
And I can't stop
because of the momentum built up.

234
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:18,824
I don't know where to go from here.

235
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:22,369
I'm too exhausted.

236
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:27,499
What should I do?

237
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,214
Want my advice?

238
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:41,013
I know I'll regret listening to it,

239
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:42,431
but go ahead.

240
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:47,728
Don't set yourself
any destinations in life from now on.

241
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:51,356
If you lose your way
while running towards something,

242
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,152
it sets you adrift, like with you now.

243
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:59,072
But if you lose your way
while wandering aimlessly,

244
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,825
it doesn't set you adrift.

245
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,577
It just makes you a drifter,

246
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,245
like me.

247
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:10,792
So, what do you say?
Want to become a drifter with me?

248
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:15,672
Do you know what
they call people who talk like you?

249
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:17,341
What?

250
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:20,969
Delusional freaks.

251
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,972
I know you agree. Don't pretend you don't.

252
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,349
Where are you going?

253
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:27,100
Stay there, you delusional freak.

254
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:29,019
Come on, let's be drifters together.

255
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:30,646
No! Stop following me!

256
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,148
-Just for a week!
-Not even for one second!

257
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:38,403
Wait, where did you get this?

258
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:43,116
The police said
they needed more time to investigate…

259
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:48,247
My mother pulled some strings, didn't she?

260
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,253
I guess she told you to hunt him down

261
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:56,129
on the down-low, without…

262
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:00,968
He's not an orphan after all.

263
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,135
CHILD
CHAE SEUNG-HYEOK

264
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,136
Chae Seung-hyeok?

265
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,263
CHILD 2
CHAE SEUNG-A

266
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:07,933
From the same orphanage.
We are like brother and sister.

267
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,352
More like close friends.

268
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:14,314
Why did Jae-mi lie to me?

269
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:22,948
<i>You see, in most similar cases,</i>
<i>it's not kidnapping.</i>

270
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:26,285
It's highly likely
that they ran away together.

271
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:29,454
Hell, no! I mean, no, it can't be.

272
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,834
What am I thinking? Of course not.

273
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,986
We're heading home, aren't we?

274
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:04,197
You're taking me
and these documents to my mother, right?

275
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:33,643
Hey…

276
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:36,021
Look, I'm really sorry.

277
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:39,024
I know my mom hired you for a mission.

278
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,943
But I'm sorry, I can't go home now.

279
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:47,074
I'm not going home without Jae-mi.

280
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:49,076
Stop!

281
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:51,244
If you try to take me by force,

282
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:53,497
I'll run into the road.

283
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,917
I'm serious. I will put my life in danger.

284
00:22:57,667 --> 00:23:00,253
Stay, John Na. Stay.

285
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:03,882
I don't mean to offend you, John.

286
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:06,510
This really is nothing personal.

287
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:09,137
It's just that I have to protect someone.

288
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,390
Please understand.

289
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:13,225
Damn it!

290
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:34,287
I'm not going home.

291
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:37,290
I'm not going home.

292
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:40,627
You're coming with me?

293
00:23:51,179 --> 00:23:53,807
SANTAEK STATION

294
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:56,476
Two for the next train to Busan.

295
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,519
One moment, sir.

296
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:03,733
Here you go.

297
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:05,318
Thank you.

298
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:13,827
Here. It's warm.

299
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,666
There are no shops around here.

300
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:22,794
We'll get you
some new clothes and stuff in Busan.

301
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:28,175
Where did you buy
this ugly tracksuit anyway?

302
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:31,136
I didn't.
I grabbed it off someone's clothesline.

303
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:33,221
Let's go. The train's almost here.

304
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:36,183
Thieving bastard.

305
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:45,525
-Come on, let's go.
-Yes, I'm coming.

306
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:56,203
Holy crap! Are you crazy?

307
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:22,729
Here.

308
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:24,523
Thank you, ma'am.

309
00:25:30,654 --> 00:25:32,364
How embarrassing.

310
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:41,081
Time for some num-nums.

311
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:45,502
There you go. My sweet baby.

312
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:51,800
-Want some gummies?
-There.

313
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:57,055
Oh, dear.

314
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:05,105
There, there.

315
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:12,028
-Daddy, pick me up!
-All right, Ji-han.

316
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:12,946
Here we go.

317
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:17,033
Here, Ji-han.

318
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:33,842
<i>Why are we going to Busan?</i>

319
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,303
<i>To find my dad.</i>

320
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:38,179
<i>You have a dad?</i>

321
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:41,766
<i>You think my mom just slithered around</i>
<i>and got herself pregnant</i>

322
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,518
<i>like some hermaphrodite worm?</i>

323
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:48,064
<i>No. I mean,</i>
<i>you've never talked about your family.</i>

324
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:50,984
<i>That's because I have no family.</i>

325
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:54,279
This guy just supplied the seed.

326
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:56,781
My father, the sperm donor.

327
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:59,784
The guy who forced me
to live in this messed-up world.

328
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,119
Something like that.

329
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:03,204
Okay, and now what?

330
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:08,126
There are five candidates.
I've already ruled one out.

331
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:12,130
The owner of that <i>sundae </i>soup place?

332
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:18,136
Well, I'm sure glad it wasn't him.

333
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,013
Why?

334
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:22,807
I hate parents who spoil their crappy kids

335
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:26,019
just because they're their children.

336
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:28,188
Are you comforting me?

337
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:31,107
In your dreams.

338
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,698
Why do you want to find him anyway?

339
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:40,075
I'm just curious.

340
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:43,828
Why now?

341
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:48,792
'Cause the school break is nearly over.

342
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:53,672
It's like catching up on homework.

343
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,353
Excuse me.

344
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:55,942
Are you done yet?

345
00:28:57,694 --> 00:29:00,447
Hey, we're here! We've got to get off!

346
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,118
Hey! Can you at least answer me?

347
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:10,999
No need to broadcast me taking a shit.

348
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:13,334
Let's go. Damn, it's hot.

349
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:18,256
BUSAN STATION

350
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:19,466
Where do we go now?

351
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,092
Clothes shopping.

352
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:28,516
Actually, that does look good on you.

353
00:29:29,017 --> 00:29:30,226
-This?
-Yes.

354
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,521
-No need to go shopping.
-Hey!

355
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,652
<i>Hey, we're here! We've got to get off!</i>

356
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:45,366
No need to broadcast me taking a shit.
Let's go. Damn, it's hot.

357
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:52,415
Hey!

358
00:29:57,003 --> 00:30:00,465
Why did you pass out yesterday?
You had a nosebleed and everything.

359
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:05,637
-Hey!
-Isn't it obvious why?

360
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:09,098
Your fiancé crashed into my car,
sending it down the hill.

361
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:11,059
I hit my head on the wheel!

362
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:14,646
If my hair was any thinner,
I would've gotten a concussion.

363
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:16,397
-Anyone else--
-Look, a cab.

364
00:30:58,481 --> 00:30:59,440
What?

365
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,401
What is it?

366
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:06,281
Hey, what's going on? Wait a second.

367
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:09,742
Where are we going?

368
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:15,748
Busan?

369
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:19,627
That's where they are?
What are they doing in Busan?

370
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:23,089
Hey, watch out!
Don't cut across the centerline like that!

371
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:46,237
Hey, wait for me!

372
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:53,119
What about one for me?

373
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,291
Come pay for this!

374
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:13,473
New undies. Finally.

375
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:16,225
Any 34A size bra, please.

376
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:18,686
Actually, it's B. 32B. It's a B.

377
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,605
Did you just laugh?

378
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,195
This is so you.

379
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,032
-How much?
-It's 30,000 won.

380
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:38,498
And that one?

381
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,254
What are you doing?

382
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:46,547
I'm shielding you.

383
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:49,008
-From what?
-Here you go.

384
00:32:49,092 --> 00:32:50,426
Thanks. Let's go.

385
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,761
All 200,000 won each.

386
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:55,974
{\an8}REPAIR/USED PHONES

387
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:01,521
-I'll take this one.
-Sure.

388
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:06,734
<i>Boss, get out of there</i>
<i>as soon as you get this message, okay?</i>

389
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,572
<i>The Prince Gang bastards want you dead.</i>

390
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,702
<i>Don't take it personally.</i>
<i>I had to rat you out to save myself.</i>

391
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:18,788
<i>Why the fuck did you take his bride</i>
<i>and start this shitstorm?</i>

392
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:21,082
"Bride"?

393
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:24,043
What the hell?

394
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:32,510
What the heck?

395
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:34,429
Man, I sure am beat.

396
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:37,265
I need something sweet and greasy.

397
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:44,981
-Here, go ahead.
-That's a first.

398
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:47,191
Fuck, it's hot.

399
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:48,776
Don't forget mine.

400
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,446
Hey! You're so dead.

401
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:52,947
Hey! Over here!

402
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:55,575
What now?

403
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:57,118
This is so good.

404
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:03,249
Blood vessels knotted up abnormally.

405
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,127
You can have mine.

406
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:08,629
What's wrong?

407
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:10,882
It's me. You knew it was.

408
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:12,925
Drop the act, Bong-suk.

409
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:15,845
Don't get fresh with me, you little brat.

410
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:20,016
I said, "Clear out your place,"
not "vanish without a trace." You weasel.

411
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:21,476
Hey, Seong.

412
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:23,311
Okay.

413
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:25,938
You should find yourself a pretty boy.

414
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:31,402
I'd be lucky if I'm not blinded
by all the ugly mugs in this business.

415
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,946
You should go home already.

416
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,406
Where are you?

417
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:38,743
You know, if I'm not in your arms,
I'm on the streets.

418
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:39,660
<i>All alone?</i>

419
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:43,122
No, I'm with a girl.

420
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:44,582
<i>Is she pretty?</i>

421
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:46,209
Kind of dowdy.

422
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:49,504
Pretty bumpkins seem to be your type.

423
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:52,632
What's Kkari up to these days?

424
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:54,675
-Your ex was--
-<i>What's he up to?</i>

425
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,845
Stop interrupting me, will you?

426
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:58,971
Want me to hang up?

427
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,934
He's suited and booted these days. Happy?

428
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,645
Really? That's good. What kind of job?

429
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:06,813
Chil-seong Loans.

430
00:35:07,396 --> 00:35:10,066
<i>The Prince Gang hired him as their lackey.</i>

431
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:12,401
He switched sides the moment you left.

432
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:14,028
-<i>You know him.</i>
-So pretty.

433
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,905
<i>He always seemed like a rat.</i>

434
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:18,116
<i>No wonder he's flipped sides.</i>

435
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:22,245
I only have 10,000 won right now.

436
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:25,081
Find out what Chil-seong is up to.

437
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:26,874
I would be taking a loss.

438
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:29,252
But they're so pretty. Please?

439
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:31,087
-Sorry, no.
-We'll take them.

440
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:46,686
She really is a small-town cutie.

441
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:03,661
<i>If you're looking for your father,</i>

442
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:07,165
<i>why do you need</i>
<i>a bagful of cash and a burner phone</i>

443
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:09,333
<i>like some criminal on the run?</i>

444
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:13,296
<i>I am a criminal.</i>
<i>I kidnapped you, remember?</i>

445
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,716
<i>So all this, just to hide from my in-laws?</i>

446
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:21,095
<i>You did say</i>
<i>your mother-in-law was a powerhouse.</i>

447
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,471
<i>Is that really all?</i>

448
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:27,393
<i>Hey, I’ve got assholes</i>
<i>coming after me from all angles.</i>

449
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:31,981
<i>If I let my guard down,</i>
<i>I might end up with a knife in my back.</i>

450
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:42,491
This will hurt like hell.

451
00:36:42,575 --> 00:36:44,285
-Are you done?
-Stay still.

452
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:45,578
-Ready.
-Train's coming!

453
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:48,039
I was only doing what Hae Jo told me!

454
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:49,999
I don't know anything, boss!

455
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:53,336
-Isn't it hot today?
-Please don't kill me!

456
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:58,257
Oh, man. Should I let you live?

457
00:36:58,341 --> 00:36:59,592
Please let me live, sir.

458
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:03,054
There's still so much I haven't done.
Please spare me, boss!

459
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:05,306
-Listen, kiddo.
-Yes, boss?

460
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:09,143
Remember <i>Jokduri</i>, the guy who
made a scene at the station yesterday?

461
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,978
Yes, I do remember him, boss.

462
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:12,647
Did you learn anything?

463
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:13,564
Pardon?

464
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:18,736
There's nothing a man can fear
once the woman he loves is taken from him.

465
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:26,369
There's nothing he wouldn't do. Get it?

466
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:32,291
<i>Boss, get out of there</i>
<i>when you get this message, okay?</i>

467
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:34,919
<i>The Prince Gang bastards want you dead.</i>

468
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:38,172
<i>Why did you take his bride</i>
<i>and start this shitstorm?</i>

469
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:45,388
That bastard Hae Jo bolted
a minute before we got there.

470
00:37:45,471 --> 00:37:48,266
Fucking unbelievable timing,
if you ask me.

471
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:51,102
So I had someone hack your phone.

472
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:54,188
Tech whizzes can do all sorts these days.

473
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:58,567
Korea really leads the way in IT.
Cheers to that.

474
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:00,403
-Cheers!
-You fucking asshole.

475
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:02,738
Sorry, boss. I'll never do it again!

476
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:05,533
Please give me one more chance.
I'm begging you!

477
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:06,867
Here comes the train.

478
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:11,497
No! Please let me go! Stop it!

479
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,873
Hey, keep still.

480
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:15,876
You'll lose your limbs,
but you might still live.

481
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:19,338
Boss, he pissed his pants again.

482
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,842
Don't be scared. I never kill my own.

483
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:24,218
-Traitors though?
-No!

484
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,511
I split them in half.

485
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:29,307
Look, it's coming! Oh no!

486
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,641
-It's coming!
-No!

487
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,143
Hey, kiddo!

488
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:34,437
Whose side are you on? Hae Jo's or…

489
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,646
Yours, Chil-seong!

490
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:38,524
-Watch your fucking tone.
-On your side, boss!

491
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,402
-Oh no!
-Boss! No, stop!

492
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:01,672
-What an idiot.
-Oh boy.

493
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:05,551
Someone get this kid a diaper.

494
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:07,219
He won't stop leaking.

495
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:10,348
Fuck. I really thought I was going to die.

496
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:12,767
Were you scared? You're all sweaty.

497
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:14,310
Here's the thing.

498
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:18,230
The train that runs on this track
will pass by in an hour and a half.

499
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:21,859
I want you to find out

500
00:39:21,942 --> 00:39:24,445
where that bastard Hae Jo is before that.

501
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:25,905
Otherwise--

502
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:28,115
I will! I'll find him, I promise!

503
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,159
I'll track the fucker down, boss!

504
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:34,288
Very well. Good luck.

505
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:36,582
Untie him.

506
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:38,751
Thank you, boss! Thank you so much!

507
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:47,093
Excuse me.
Is there some kind of log cabin up there?

508
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:48,094
How beautiful.

509
00:39:50,304 --> 00:39:52,306
-First time here?
-It's so nice.

510
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:57,478
This way.

511
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:04,693
-Oh my God! Damn!
-Hey!

512
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:07,947
-For God's sake…
-Snake!

513
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,615
-Fuck!
-A snake, shit!

514
00:40:09,698 --> 00:40:11,200
Snake!

515
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:12,701
Snake!

516
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:16,122
<i>It was almost impossible</i>
<i>to track down Ko Jae-geun.</i>

517
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:19,875
<i>He's been jumping</i>
<i>from place to place like a grasshopper.</i>

518
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:21,710
<i>The most recent info I've got</i>

519
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:25,798
<i>is that he lives like a hermit,</i>
<i>up on Mount Gudeok, but I'm not sure.</i>

520
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:32,680
Hello?

521
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,017
Is anyone inside?

522
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,602
No. Where the hell…

523
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:41,564
Hello?

524
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:48,237
-I'm beat.
-Who are you?

525
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:01,125
Answer me.

526
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:06,255
Well… I'm…

527
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:13,345
Sir, do you live here?

528
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:14,972
Yes. So what?

529
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:17,975
And your name is Mr. Ko Jae-geun?

530
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,275
Who are you people?

531
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:28,319
Oh, I'm sorry.

532
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:30,696
We should've introduced ourselves.

533
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,158
Let me quickly explain why we're here.

534
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:35,493
Well, we're here

535
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:39,371
looking for the sperm that created him!

536
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:47,713
Sperm donor.

537
00:41:48,547 --> 00:41:50,799
Right, the sperm donor. Sorry.

538
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:55,763
He's searching for his biological father

539
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:58,140
and I'm just accompanying him.

540
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:02,645
And?

541
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:06,941
We're not here
to disrupt your life in any way, sir.

542
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:08,275
There's no need to worry.

543
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:11,237
He just wants to know
who his biological father is.

544
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:14,281
You know,
the typical identity crisis cliché.

545
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:18,202
Self-discovery and finding your roots.
"Who am I? Where do I come from?"

546
00:42:18,786 --> 00:42:20,496
That sort of thing.

547
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:25,042
So, if it's not too much to ask,

548
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:28,212
we were wondering
if we could get your toothbrush,

549
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:31,215
some of your hair, or a saliva sample.

550
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:51,777
Interesting.

551
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:02,413
Right, Unpung Pharm.

552
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:06,000
I did donate a few times
when I worked as a sales rep there.

553
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:10,004
I'd lost a lot on the stock market,
so I was running low on cash.

554
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:14,758
They gave you a gift card
worth 100,000 won for every donation,

555
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:16,135
so I went for it.

556
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:19,597
It was a pretty decent sum at the time.

557
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:23,100
So you're a tango dancer?

558
00:43:26,145 --> 00:43:27,146
I used to be.

559
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:30,190
When my dear Ok-jeong passed away,

560
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:34,194
I couldn't find another partner
I could connect with at that level.

561
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:35,738
So I quit years ago.

562
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:49,001
I dabbled a bit
in ballroom dancing myself.

563
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:54,214
Hey.

564
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:57,343
Hey, you've got some rhythm there.

565
00:43:57,926 --> 00:43:58,969
-Hey.
-Right?

566
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:00,929
-Of course.
-Let's see.

567
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:04,558
The tango is all about connection.

568
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:07,770
Our hearts become one.

569
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:11,106
One heart and four legs.

570
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:13,567
That's it.

571
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:17,029
All right. Hey! Slide. Okay.

572
00:44:19,114 --> 00:44:20,199
Am I any good?

573
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:30,167
He's a bit of a buzzkill.

574
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:39,843
You don't live with your family?

575
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:40,928
I don't have any.

576
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:45,641
Back in the day,
I had a bit of a bad habit

577
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:47,309
so my wife and I split up.

578
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:48,894
We never had kids.

579
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:51,021
Well, I might have one now.

580
00:44:54,775 --> 00:44:57,778
Apparently, paternity tests
can come back in a day now.

581
00:44:57,861 --> 00:44:59,947
Available 24-7. Amazing, isn't it?

582
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,448
Really that quick?

583
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:06,745
In that case,
why don't you stay the night?

584
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:10,708
I want to see the test results too.

585
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:11,709
Could we?

586
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:13,460
Thank God.

587
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:16,463
I was worried
about going back down the mountain.

588
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:17,673
-Right?
-Yes.

589
00:45:17,756 --> 00:45:19,466
All right, then.

590
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:23,011
The attic is spacious.
Let me clean it up for you.

591
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:24,138
Give me a moment.

592
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:34,356
You two have that same sly smile.

593
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:35,566
It's uncanny.

594
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:38,527
I can't believe it.

595
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:39,778
Right? You see it too?

596
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:43,282
I can't believe
how direct you were with him.

597
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:46,952
And it worked.

598
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:50,664
Honesty really is the best policy.

599
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:53,542
It's called people skills.

600
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:57,671
You might want to learn from me
instead of always trying to con people.

601
00:45:57,755 --> 00:45:59,673
I don't always try to con people.

602
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:01,383
Sure you do.

603
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:12,603
From Namwon to Busan?

604
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:15,230
What business does he have there

605
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:18,609
that would make him leave
so early in the morning with Jae-mi?

606
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:20,527
There must be a good reason.

607
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:23,614
Where did they go after the station?

608
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:27,910
You don't know?

609
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:31,246
Are you unable to talk or refusing?

610
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:35,709
Or do you just not want to talk to me?

611
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:37,419
Is that it?

612
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:42,132
See? That's why you shouldn't eat so fast.
Give me your hand.

613
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:45,052
Just give it.

614
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:49,890
See how tense it is?
You're all blocked up. Relax.

615
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:52,518
So you do understand me. Good.

616
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:53,685
That's it, great.

617
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:56,772
We're partners now, right?

618
00:46:56,855 --> 00:46:58,941
We'll have to stick together

619
00:46:59,024 --> 00:47:01,485
until we find that jerk Chae Seung-hyeok.

620
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:03,862
We need to be able to communicate.

621
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:07,324
Did you know

622
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:12,037
people communicate with each other
in three different ways?

623
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:16,291
One is through words.

624
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:20,379
As in actually talking.
Another is through eye contact.

625
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:24,091
And lastly, physical touch.

626
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:32,182
At least we managed one of those today.

627
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:34,476
Right?

628
00:47:42,317 --> 00:47:45,779
John? Mr. John Na,
will you give me a hand with these?

629
00:47:46,613 --> 00:47:49,700
He looks all flushed.
He must have awful indigestion.

630
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:03,297
You forgot these! Come on, open up.

631
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:09,845
Where am I?

632
00:48:09,928 --> 00:48:11,263
What the hell should I do?

633
00:48:11,346 --> 00:48:13,765
I'm fucking exhausted.

634
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:19,146
This is killing me.

635
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:26,153
Text me the results

636
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:29,907
by tomorrow morning at the latest.

637
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:33,869
Fucking hell. If it wasn't urgent,
you could've just mailed it!

638
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:36,997
Did you have to make me
climb all the way up here? Damn it.

639
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,541
True. Well, bye. Watch out for the snakes.

640
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:41,168
Wait, snakes? Shit.

641
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:45,505
There. Now this is a good one.

642
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:52,220
Living here and eating things like this,
you could easily live past 100.

643
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:53,263
You never know

644
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:55,015
what fate has in store.

645
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:58,936
It's not determined by the land,
but by the heavens above.

646
00:48:59,019 --> 00:49:00,479
Is that so?

647
00:49:00,562 --> 00:49:03,565
Back in my big pharma days,
I had several brain surgeries.

648
00:49:03,649 --> 00:49:05,859
They thought I wouldn't make it.

649
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:06,860
Oh, really?

650
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:08,987
So I gave up on everything

651
00:49:09,071 --> 00:49:12,282
and started wandering around aimlessly.

652
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:15,327
But look at me now.
Still here, doing pretty well.

653
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:17,746
That's when I realized.

654
00:49:17,829 --> 00:49:19,331
I shouldn't be so desperate.

655
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:22,292
It's that very desperation

656
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:24,920
that will take years off your life.

657
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:27,422
Yes, you're right.

658
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:28,382
Right?

659
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:35,472
I hope you are Hae Jo's father.

660
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:37,808
Why?

661
00:49:37,891 --> 00:49:40,143
I think you guys will hit it off.

662
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:43,063
You're both drifters

663
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:46,233
who like to roam freely
without being tied down.

664
00:49:47,025 --> 00:49:48,151
You guys are alike.

665
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:51,279
Do you like him?

666
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:53,657
No way!

667
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:55,575
I have…

668
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:59,496
Well, there was a man I almost married!

669
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:00,580
That's too bad.

670
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:04,584
I thought it'd be nice
to have you as my daughter-in-law.

671
00:50:05,460 --> 00:50:07,295
Well, I wouldn't mind

672
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:10,507
having someone like you
as my father-in-law either.

673
00:50:10,590 --> 00:50:12,759
I like talking to you. It's fun.

674
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:15,387
So, maybe we could be family someday.

675
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:16,680
Absolutely not.

676
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:20,392
You need to wash these, right?
I'll go do it.

677
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:23,228
What's got into him?

678
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:30,944
Damn.

679
00:50:35,073 --> 00:50:36,783
Is this thing broken or what?

680
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:43,665
Screw this.

681
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:55,677
I know I shouldn't be laughing,
but why is it so funny?

682
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:57,262
Of course, it is.

683
00:50:57,345 --> 00:51:00,432
My analogy was spot-on. That's why.

684
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:12,402
Oh my goodness. Look at me. I'm crying.

685
00:51:12,986 --> 00:51:15,614
Cry away, then. Just cry.

686
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:19,493
Hey, you're back.

687
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:23,955
Did you drop off the sample?

688
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:25,874
Yes.

689
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:27,709
Here, could you…?

690
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:31,171
-For me?
-No, for my potential son.

691
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:35,967
This is too awkward.
I'm going to go and pick some chilies.

692
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:42,390
Try it. It's all organic.
He's been cooking for ages just for you.

693
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:44,684
Careful. It's hot.

694
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:50,899
Don't spill it.

695
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:04,204
Occupational habit.

696
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:09,084
I'm just so used
to wiping the kids' mouths

697
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:11,378
because they spill food all the time.

698
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:17,384
Let's have dinner.

699
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:28,186
Better hurry now. Four minutes left.

700
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:30,438
I can hear the train. Hurry up.

701
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:35,277
Just pick up your damn phone,
you son of a bitch.

702
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:37,237
-Hello?
-<i>Hey, Kkari.</i>

703
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:39,739
<i>-I've been meaning to call you.</i>
-Hello, sir.

704
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:42,159
May I ask you something? I'm in a jam.

705
00:52:42,242 --> 00:52:45,245
Have you talked to Mr.,
I mean, that jerk, Hae Jo recently?

706
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:48,123
<i>That's what I wanted to ask you about.</i>

707
00:52:48,206 --> 00:52:51,668
<i>I've been finding some addresses for him,</i>
<i>like he asked.</i>

708
00:52:51,751 --> 00:52:53,086
Sorry? Addresses?

709
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:54,546
<i>What's going on?</i>

710
00:52:54,629 --> 00:52:57,048
<i>Don't get me involved in some fucked-up--</i>

711
00:52:57,132 --> 00:53:01,052
Can I have the addresses you gave him?

712
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:04,389
Yes. You can text them to me. Thank you.

713
00:53:10,312 --> 00:53:12,022
What's this? You made our beds?

714
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:17,194
It wasn't me.
Mr. Ko seems to think we're a couple.

715
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:20,614
He's not being subtle about it.
Move farther back.

716
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:22,616
Hey, don't be ungrateful.

717
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:26,328
You two seem pretty close.

718
00:53:26,411 --> 00:53:27,704
Yes, it's strange.

719
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:31,541
I've only just met him,
but I'm already opening up to him,

720
00:53:32,125 --> 00:53:33,168
just like that.

721
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:36,171
I told him about my menopause.

722
00:53:36,922 --> 00:53:40,175
-What?
-That's why we were laughing earlier.

723
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:45,513
<i>There was a potato</i>
<i>with a tiny baby potato attached to it.</i>

724
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:46,932
<i>So I said</i>…

725
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:51,269
Even potatoes have babies.
So what does that make me?

726
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:54,689
A girl no better than a potato?

727
00:53:57,275 --> 00:53:59,027
And you know what he said?

728
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:00,946
What did he say?

729
00:54:02,864 --> 00:54:04,866
<i>He grabbed the mushrooms and said,</i>

730
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:09,454
<i>"Look, even mushrooms are marked</i>
<i>with the name of their producer."</i>

731
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:13,375
"But Hae Jo
doesn't even know who made him!"

732
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:16,169
<i>"So is he no better than a mushroom?"</i>

733
00:54:22,801 --> 00:54:23,927
My stomach hurts.

734
00:54:25,470 --> 00:54:28,056
I mean, it makes perfect sense,
doesn't it?

735
00:54:28,139 --> 00:54:30,267
How did he come up with that?

736
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:32,560
It's just hilarious.

737
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:34,437
You're right.

738
00:54:35,146 --> 00:54:38,525
I mean, it's really sad
if you think about it.

739
00:54:38,608 --> 00:54:41,319
But somehow, I find it hysterical.

740
00:54:45,031 --> 00:54:46,866
A girl no better than a potato.

741
00:54:47,742 --> 00:54:49,744
A guy no better than a mushroom.

742
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:55,083
It's so funny.

743
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:06,052
Jae-mi.

744
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:08,805
Yes?

745
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:12,517
You can just cry.

746
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:23,862
Don't force yourself to laugh.

747
00:55:25,405 --> 00:55:26,823
Just cry instead.

748
00:55:37,208 --> 00:55:39,127
I'm tired. Switch off the lights.

749
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:46,069
What is this?

750
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:49,322
You know.

751
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:52,200
Just a mushroom cuddling a potato.

752
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:51,838
