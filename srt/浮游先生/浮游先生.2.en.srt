1
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,727
<i>Well, let's see.</i>

2
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:22,731
<i>This story goes back about 30 years or so.</i>

3
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:26,651
As I explained...

4
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:29,571
<i>There was once a wealthy young couple.</i>

5
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:33,074
<i>The husband was diagnosed
with testicular cancer.</i>

6
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:35,577
<i>The news hit them out of the blue.</i>

7
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:40,331
<i>The cancer was one thing,
but they were also desperate for a baby.</i>

8
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:43,918
<i>- So what did they do?</i>
- I'll freeze it.

9
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:46,129
<i>Semen cryopreservation.</i>

10
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:51,342
<i>He decided to freeze his sperm
before he began chemo.</i>

11
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:57,390
<i>He was more determined
to have a child than to beat cancer.</i>

12
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:07,650
<i>Thankfully, his cancer was cured,
and two years later...</i>

13
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,951
<i>They tried artificial insemination</i>

14
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,870
<i>using the sperm he had frozen.</i>

15
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:24,417
<i>And miraculously, they had a baby boy.
Can you imagine their joy?</i>

16
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:40,934
<i>The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.</i>

17
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:46,773
<i>The boy was so much like his father,
who showered him with love.</i>

18
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:54,906
- Nice.
- There.

19
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:55,989
A bit higher.

20
00:01:57,408 --> 00:01:59,786
- Nice.
- I'll throw it higher too!

21
00:01:59,869 --> 00:02:01,287
Oh, hello, Doctor.

22
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,874
<i>Now here's the funny part.</i>

23
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:10,046
<i>The dad's sperm was definitely stored
in container number 139.</i>

24
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:15,093
<i>But that stupid clinic used sperm
from container number 137 by mistake.</i>

25
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:16,302
<i>Can you believe it?</i>

26
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:23,393
<i>They made the baby
with some random dude's sperm.</i>

27
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:26,980
Well...

28
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:33,611
It's like picking a pumpkin
from a watermelon patch, so to speak.

29
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,990
Only they didn't discover
this shocking truth

30
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:38,950
until eight years later.

31
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:41,536
Unbelievable!
How fucked up is that? Right?

32
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:42,954
My God, that's terrible.

33
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:44,831
- Yes.
- It sounds like a soap opera.

34
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:47,333
And? What happened next?

35
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:50,503
The mom totally lost it,
and the dad completely cut him off.

36
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:53,047
And the poor kid was so confused.

37
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:56,718
He couldn't handle it, so he ran away.
It was a total mess.

38
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:59,512
So they really just abandoned the boy?

39
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,264
You can't just abandon a kid

40
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,808
after years of raising him as your own.

41
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:07,312
But from the husband's standpoint,
he is just a random kid.

42
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:10,064
I couldn't keep raising him as my own.

43
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:12,066
He must've felt cheated.

44
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,611
- What did the kid ever do?
- That's ridiculous!

45
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:17,030
Hey, you know what?

46
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,490
For an accidental murder,

47
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:22,869
you end up in prison
for homicide, manslaughter,

48
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:24,662
or something like that.

49
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:28,416
But what if you accidentally
bring someone into the world?

50
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:31,753
There's no law against that.

51
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:34,297
- How unfair.
- We should file a petition.

52
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,550
A petition to get the place shut down
is the least we could do!

53
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:42,347
So what are you all still doing here?
It was this goddamn clinic.

54
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:45,892
That's nonsense.

55
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,478
It's not nonsense.

56
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:51,814
That godforsaken kid
who was born due to this clinic's screwup...

57
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:56,444
with that goddamn sperm number 137

58
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,113
was me.

59
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:12,669

00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,443
To collect what you owe me.

63
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:40,071
Sperm donor 137, my biological father.

64
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:43,491
Give me his information, and I'll leave.

65
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:45,743
Unfortunately...

66
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:48,413
"Unfortunately." I fucking hate that word.

67
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:52,792
I can't provide any details
about an anonymous donor.

68
00:04:55,003 --> 00:04:56,838
So what you're saying is,

69
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:00,758
you're required
to keep their information confidential,

70
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:05,930
but not required to compensate me,
the very result of your mistake?

71
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:09,475
What a total douchebag.
A well-educated one at that.

72
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:11,227
Excuse me?

73
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:16,024
I've already accepted moral responsibility
and compensated your parents enough...

74
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:18,192
What about me?

75
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:21,696
No apology or compensation for the victim?

76
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:23,656
And I'm not asking for money here.

77
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:28,244
Give me the details of donor number 137,
and we'll call it even.

78
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:32,915
If someone orders black bean noodles...

79
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,125
What?

80
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,877
...but the chef

81
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,671
accidentally serves them seafood noodles,

82
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:42,050
then all he has to do
is apologize and give a refund.

83
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:45,845
Does he need to apologize
to the seafood noodles?

84
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,401
Oh wow. Man!

85
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:04,781
This well-educated douchebag
can even make bullshit sound logical.

86
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,324
Hey!

87
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:11,162
You're not entirely wrong though.
"A mistaken order."

88
00:06:12,622 --> 00:06:14,082
That sounds about right.

89
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:18,044
But look, Dr. Douchebag.

90
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:23,174
I've got 13 bombs in my head
and three months left to live, at most.

91
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:25,093
And it's fucking hereditary.

92
00:06:25,802 --> 00:06:29,013
I guess the wrong order
just gets thrown in the trash, huh?

93
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:33,601
I don't have much to do
before I kick the bucket.

94
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:36,312
So I thought I'd look up my dad,
but I can't?

95
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:40,274
- I may as well die now.
- Hey.

96
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:43,319
And I don't want to go alone,
so you're coming with me.

97
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:50,910
Fine, I'll do it! I'll give it to you!

100
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:29,866
Good heavens,
do you think you're here to goof off?

101
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:31,701
- It's too thick.
- Yes, ma'am.

102
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,911
- Hello, ma'am.
- Look.

103
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,204
- As hard as rock.
- Oh my!

104
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:37,999
Go on, serve them.

105
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,297
Then let's say it's a kidnapping instead.

106
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,341
Are you insane? Let go.

107
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:50,845
Not into running away or kidnapping?
How about a trip?

108
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:53,514
For about two weeks, or even a month.

109
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:56,934
I need to find someone,
so I'm traveling nationwide.

110
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:58,519
You're insane.

111
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:01,814
- Want to join me?
- I should be going on my honeymoon.

112
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:03,608
Why should I go with you?

113
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:04,817
Because you're Jae-mi.

114
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,197
Because it's who you are.

115
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:13,951
You're fun.

116
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:16,537
With you by my side, I'd never be bored...

117
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,041
You goddamn psycho.

118
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,882
- What if they find out?
- What?

119
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:29,383
That you're not pregnant.

120
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,222
How could you be pregnant
when you're in menopause?

121
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:39,227
You're scamming them.
That's a crime, Jae-mi.

122
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:42,313
- Are you threatening me?
- I'm asking you to cooperate.

123
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:45,107
Come with me.

124
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:51,739
All right.

125
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:03,125
I didn't know you had a guest. Who's this?

126
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:06,837
Oh, sweetie, this is my...

127
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:09,173
- My old...
- Older brother.

128
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,594
You're her older brother?

129
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:18,266
From the same orphanage.
We are like brother and sister.

130
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,560
More like close friends.

131
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:27,108
He insisted on coming
all the way down here.

132
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:28,651
You have no family,

133
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,404
and I'm like a brother to you,
so how could I miss it?

134
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:34,282
Yes, of course. I'm glad you're here.

135
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:39,412
My name is Eo Heung.
"Heung" as in "prosperity."

136
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:41,414
"Eo Heung"?

137
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,668
It's funny, right?

138
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:49,922
I'm Heung and she's Jae-mi.
Jae-mi and Heung.

139
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:53,301
Both our names mean "fun."
We're a perfect match.

140
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,094
- A match made...
- In heaven.

141
00:09:56,095 --> 00:10:00,141
I know you come from
a strictly hierarchical family,

142
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:04,729
but since I'm like her brother,
we can be on a first-name basis, right?

143
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:08,441
He looks younger than his age.

144
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:11,152
No, we're the same age. Give or take...

145
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:14,405
12 years.

146
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,742
Just 12?

147
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:19,702
- You...
- What?

148
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:22,330
- What are you...
- I mean, look at his face.

149
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:23,998
All right then.

150
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:26,751
If you're like a big brother to Jae-mi,

151
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,419
you are to me as well.

152
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:33,424
I know I'm older,
but treat me like a cute little brother.

153
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,426
Sure.

154
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:38,304
Sweetheart. We should go out now, right?

155
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:41,182
No, we have to wait
because of the chicken.

156
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:45,102
- The chicken?
- One of the lucky roosters got away.

157
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:58,658
What do you like about her?

158
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:01,160
Everything.

159
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:04,413
She's lovely from head to toe.

160
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,586
Really?
Even once the honeymoon phase is over?

161
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,630
You should get going.

162
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:13,964
- Go where?
- Already?

163
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:16,842
You said you had to be
back in Seoul by 1 p.m.

164
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,761
Thanks for coming. Bye.

165
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,722
- No, I...
- Stay for the ceremony at least.

166
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:22,806
I should, right?

167
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:25,434
You don't want to get stuck in traffic.
Now go.

168
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:28,145
I'll walk him to the door
and be right back.

169
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,730
But still...

170
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:41,283
Just get out of here, okay? Go!

171
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,618
- Fine.
- Damn.

172
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:44,911
Wait!

173
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,342
Shit.

174
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,136
Oh! Fuck.

175
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:02,095
What the hell?

176
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:08,936
I will take care of her
until the day I die.

177
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:12,982
That's what love is to me.

178
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,819
To support and to cherish, no matter what.

179
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:19,613
And I know I can do that.

180
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:20,906
You can trust me.

181
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:35,379
This is what I wanted to say
when you asked me earlier.

182
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:40,342
All right, then.
Let's keep in touch, brother.

183
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,099
<i>He seemed a little slow.</i>

184
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,518
Your taste in men sure has changed.

185
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:52,438
Do you love him?

186
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:56,817
And will he still love you
even if you end his bloodline?

187
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,738
Yes, I love him.

188
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:03,199
And he clearly loves me
more than I deserve.

189
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:06,702
He even used that old trick
of pretending I was pregnant

190
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,370
to get his family on board.

191
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:12,291
You two have that in common.
Rushing into things.

192
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,919
But you know what makes him different?

193
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:18,547
He's not scared of commitment.

194
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:20,466
You heard him.

195
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:23,844
He loves me, so he takes care of me.

196
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,724
That's why I chose him.

197
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:31,936
I'm never going to give up
on this marriage.

198
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,023
I don't want to see you again.

199
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:45,658
Can you see me here?

200
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,580
What the hell are you doing? Put me down!

201
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,707
- Kidnapping you.
- Put me down, you jerk!

202
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,877
- I'll bring you back after the trip.
- I swear I'll kill...

203
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:00,381
What was that? Hey! Jae-mi?

204
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:04,718
- Hey.
- Grab the chicken!

205
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,138
Goddamn it.

206
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:23,737
Good heavens. What on earth is going on?

207
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,325
My goodness.

208
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,504
Why won't they pave
this fucking road already?

209
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:48,137
Damn it.

210
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:56,228
Shit.

211
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,402
Hold this.

212
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:06,530
- Yes.
- Hold it tight.

213
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:13,328
Oh man.

214
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:24,006
<i>The number you have dialed is currently...</i>

215
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,089
VACANT

216
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:26,425
HAE JO ERRAND HOUSE

217
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:28,344
<i>The number you have dialed...</i>

218
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,973
<i>The number you have dialed

219
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,608
<i>The number you have dialed is...</i>

220
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:44,944
Fuck, answer your goddamn phone.

221
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:46,946
You crazy bastard.

222
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,989
THOSE WITHOUT ROOTS ARE BASTARDS!

223
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:50,866
Doesn't she know who we are?

224
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,619
We are one of the most prestigious clans!

225
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:57,706
In the 500-year history
of the Pungyeong Eo clan,

226
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:02,544
never before has such a disgrace occurred
on such an important day.

227
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:06,674
It must be your lack of virtue

228
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:11,345
that caused the bride,
who is pregnant, no less,

229
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:13,389
to flee right before her wedding!

230
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:17,434
They say a good upbringing shows,
and it's true.

231
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:20,270
The idea of letting that lowly orphan

232
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:23,107
marry the eldest son of our family

233
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,943
was simply preposterous from the start.

234
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:28,195
Our dear Heung is no ordinary boy.

235
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:30,906
He's our clan's
cherished fifth-generation only son,

236
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:34,660
a child you finally had
20 years after joining our family.

237
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,663
And now,
the bride carrying his child has vanished.

238
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:40,457
Don't you realize
the gravity of the situation?

239
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,836
This is what happens
when you leave a woman in charge

240
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,546
of family matters.

241
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:46,629
Exactly.

242
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:52,678
It looks like
you've been waiting for me to slip up.

243
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:55,097
This must be quite the day for you indeed.

244
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:58,517
What did you say? How dare you...

245
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,810
How dare <i>you</i>!

246
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:02,563
How dare you speak to me this way?

247
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:05,274
This family used to be so poor

248
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:09,695
that you had to sell the trees in the yard
just to afford some rice.

249
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,657
Who do you think
got this family back on its feet?

250
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,451
Who?

251
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:18,662
I did! You hear?

252
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,998
The wife of the 17th-generation heir.

253
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:22,081
Bum!

254
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:23,708
Ho!

255
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:25,711
Ja!

256
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:29,381
I made this family thrive,

257
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:33,218
and this is my son's marriage,
so I don't want to hear another word.

258
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:36,388
Now eat your beef fritters
before they go cold.

259
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,640
Along with some tea so you don't choke.

260
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:49,026
Jeez, what an overbearing woman.

261
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:51,945
No wonder our only heir
can't stand up for himself.

262
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:09,837
Mother.

263
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:13,508
Take that off.

264
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,177
Sorry?

265
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,932
Why are you still in that stupid thing?

266
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:21,975
Well, if Jae-mi comes back...

267
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:35,364
You sit tight.

268
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,826
I'll take care of everything, okay?

269
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,994
I can't just sit here. I'm her husband.

270
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:44,206
She didn't run away.

271
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:47,251
How could she? All her stuff's still here.

272
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:49,002
She didn't.

273
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,587
What if there was an accident?

274
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,464
Then we would've heard by now.

275
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:55,926
Notice anything unusual?

276
00:18:57,344 --> 00:19:00,139
- Anywhere she might have gone?
- Not really.

277
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:03,892
Do you have her friend's name
or phone number?

278
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:06,103
I didn't get to ask his name...

279
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:07,771
What do you know, then?

280
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:10,315
He was in the same orphanage as her.

281
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:12,442
Great. That really helps.

282
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,027
- Such useful information.
- Yes.

283
00:19:14,611 --> 00:19:15,946
Ho-ja,

284
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,240
I have something to tell you.

285
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,825
Can it not wait?

286
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:26,957
You told me to keep quiet

287
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,501
and not add to your stress,

288
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:32,880
so I was going to stay quiet,
but if I don't tell you now,

289
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:35,966
I fear you might scold me
for not having told you sooner.

290
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,676
So I figured I should...

291
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:39,887
Spit it out. You're giving me a headache.

292
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:44,600
I think your daughter-in-law
was kidnapped by some bastard.

293
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:48,686
Kidnapped?

294
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:51,440
I found this.

295
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:53,149
Oh God.

296
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,360
Jae-mi.

297
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,950
<i>I know I'm one of the best in the field,</i>

What is it?

308
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:50,457
Hello? Boss! Seriously?
Why didn't you answer my calls? I've been...

309
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,959
What's the matter?

310
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:53,126
Where are you?

311
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,337
- On the road.
<i>- Okay, which road?</i>

312
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,131
- Why? Are you going to come?
- Tell me where you are.

313
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:00,217
It's time for you to live your own life.

314
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,971
- Are you with someone?
- A girl I snatched from her wedding...

315
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,020
Boss, hello? Hello...

316
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,981
Let me... let me call him again.

317
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,822
A girl he snatched from a wedding?

318
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,366
So I was right.

319
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,660
That jerk kidnapped my girl and took off.

320
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:29,538
I really didn't know. I had no idea.

321
00:21:29,621 --> 00:21:32,833
I knew he was an asshole,
but not to this extent.

322
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,918
You swore on your life I was wrong.

323
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:38,297
Turns out I was right.
So maybe I should kill you.

324
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:43,176
Please don't kill me, sir.
Please, I'm begging you.

325
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,594
Is that so?

326
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:46,596
You want to live?

327
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:50,183
Yes. Please spare me this once
and I'll do anything, really...

328
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:51,727
No.

329
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:55,605
All I want from you
is to complete one simple task.

330
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:58,400
Find that bastard Hae Jo.

331
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:01,320
Sure! That's what I do best, sir.

332
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:04,489
Yes, I heard you're good
at digging things up.

333
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:06,575
- Let's see what you got.
- Yes, sir.

334
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:09,077
His life is in your hands now.

335
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:12,205
- Here.
- Yes, sir! I won't let you down!

00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:15,500
My rings!

337
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:25,886
Excuse me! Hey! Help me!

338
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:28,138
Sir! No, wait!

339
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:33,934
Shit.

340
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,696
Save the trouble and just get in.

341
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,618
What are those?

342
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:53,246
Did you put them on
knowing you'd be running away today?

343
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:55,957
- Damn it.
- Hey! Hey!

344
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,041
For God's sake.

345
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:14,559
Hey!

346
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:17,270
You've got to be kidding me.

347
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:21,608
Hey, where are you going? Jae-mi!

348
00:23:21,691 --> 00:23:24,403
Don't follow me, you crazy bastard!

349
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:32,911
- Damn it.
- Hey!

350
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,455
Do we really have to do this?

351
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,043
Damn it.

352
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:45,382
Shit. Hey!

353
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:50,636
Hey.

354
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:10,282
I'm going to kill you!

355
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:14,035
I'm really going to kill you.

356
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,412
All right.

357
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:20,250
Who do you think you are?
Who are you to ruin my life?

358
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:25,046
You dump me saying that I'm no fun,

359
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,466
and now you show up again?

360
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:32,262
You asshole!

361
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:41,563
It's all over now.

362
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:45,859
You ruined everything.

363
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,029
You're...

364
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:54,159
you're the reason my life is such a mess

365
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:58,371
and why I'm going through menopause
at this age.

366
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:03,835
It's all because of you.
You piece of shit.

367
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,879
All right.

368
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,465
I'll be punished when I die.

369
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:12,219
Stop crying now, all right?

370
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:15,972
Come on, stop crying.

371
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,618
Where are you going?

372
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:20,870
I've been calling you.

373
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:23,456
Oh, I, uh...

374
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:28,336
Look at you. You're sweating.

375
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,754
Are you hot?

376
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:32,924
Oh my gosh.

377
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:38,429
What...

378
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:42,350
I couldn't sleep. I'm just so nervous.

379
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:43,935
Oh wow.

380
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:48,481
I'm nervous too, of course.

381
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:50,817
I thought getting some fresh air

382
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,403
might calm my nerves a bit.

383
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:57,532
Dear me. You poor thing.

384
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:03,038
Jae-mi, I... Listen.

385
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:08,209
There's something urgent

386
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:11,588
I want to do with you right now.

387
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,590
There is?

388
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:19,554
- What's so urgent?
- This won't take long.

389
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,181
I got something for you.

390
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:33,817
One second.

391
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:37,989
- Is my belt on too tight?
- Why are you taking off your pants?

392
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:41,242
Better to test them out now
to avoid any nasty surprises.

393
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:42,535
What, here?

394
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:44,704
Are you for real?

395
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:48,416
I'm getting nervous
and can't get a good grip.

396
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,959
Got it. There we go.

397
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:51,961
Ta-da!

398
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:02,931
You said the other pair was too big.

399
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:06,393
It would be a disaster
if you tripped at the altar,

400
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:07,769
so give these a try.

401
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,397
Go on.

402
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:22,575
I had to scour the whole country
to find a pair in your size.

403
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:34,796
They fit perfectly. Are they comfortable?

404
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:39,425
What is it?

405
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,971
Do they hurt? Are they too small?

406
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:51,104
They say if you give a girl shoes
as a gift, she'll run away.

407
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:53,148
I'll catch you if you run away.

408
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:57,402
I suck at everything
that requires strength,

409
00:28:58,027 --> 00:29:01,698
but I excel in anything
that requires endurance,

410
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:03,742
patience, and perseverance.

411
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,454
If you run away,

412
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:10,623
I'll chase you to the ends of the earth.
Don't worry.

413
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:17,546
Thank you

414
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:21,551
for not letting me go.

415
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:27,182
Thank you

416
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:32,020
for putting up with my crazy family.

417
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:40,320
So this is what it feels like
to have a family.

418
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:44,741
It's like finally stepping into a forest

419
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:48,203
after wandering around lost
in an open field for so long.

420
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:53,124
It feels cozy and stable.

421
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,003
I love it.

422
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:05,093
Jae-mi.

423
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:10,016
Do you want to have
as many babies as possible, boys or girls,

424
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:14,145
and set a Guinness World Record
for having the most children?

425
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,730
I know I can do it.

426
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:18,650
All right.

427
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,837
No, my shoe!

428
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:56,104
Let's go. It's cold.

429
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:16,791
Let's find a place to change first.

430
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:19,085
- Where are we headed anyway?
- Namwon.

431
00:31:19,168 --> 00:31:22,297
- Why?
- One of the guys I'm looking for is there.

432
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:27,385
- There's more than one?
- He could be it if I'm lucky.

433
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:29,888
Do you still run that errand center?

434
00:31:30,388 --> 00:31:32,599
Not "center." Errand house.

435
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:34,767
Same difference.

436
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:37,770
"Center" sounds public and professional.

437
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:40,899
"House" is more private, like a home.
Not the same.

438
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:43,359
You have a home. Good for you.

439
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,528
Not anymore. I shut it down.

440
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:48,406
This is just a personal errand.

441
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:50,909
Why shut it down?

442
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:53,286
- I got bored.
- Right.

443
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:55,788
You can't stand anything boring.

444
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:04,172
I'm cold. Give me your jacket.

445
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,593
Okay, take the wheel.

446
00:32:12,055 --> 00:32:13,055
Here.

447
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,907
ENTER PASSCODE

448
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:36,204
IPHONE IS DISABLED
TRY AGAIN IN 5 MINUTES

449
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,039
Zero, one, zero, two.

450
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:41,250
What will you tell him?

451
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:44,128
- The truth.
- "Listen to me."

452
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:48,216
"I kept my menopause a secret
to marry into your prestigious family."

453
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,969
"My ex found out and kidnapped me."

454
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,178
"Please help!"

455
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:53,763
That kinda thing?

456
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:57,225
- How did you know?
- I know you.

457
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:58,351
No.

458
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:01,020
About my menopause, his family,

459
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:03,231
my wedding today, all of that.

460
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:09,445
Did you do a background check on me?

461
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:10,530
- No.
- No?

462
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:11,906
- No.
- Then how?

463
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,409
I just heard. I mean, not on purpose.

464
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:16,828
Did you suddenly get superpowers
or something?

465
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:24,293
"I must produce a son
to carry on the family line."

466
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:25,962
"I can't with early menopause!"

467
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:30,216
When you were screaming like that
at the funeral hall,

468
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:31,718
I was there.

469
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:40,435
You must feel so smug.

470
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:45,356
Knowing you were right.

471
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:51,738
You said I'd make a good wife,
but never a good mom.

472
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:56,075
You were right after all.

473
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,328
What I said back then...

474
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:01,289
Pull over. I need to pee.

475
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:49,712
There. Yes!

476
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:05,852
All right.

477
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:12,485
Okay, I got it. All right!

478
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:15,695
There we go.

479
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:20,451
Three years of being together

480
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:23,830
really helps us predict
each other's moves, doesn't it?

481
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:31,420
Hey, my shoe.

482
00:35:56,863 --> 00:35:58,239
I'm such an idiot.

483
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,002
<i>We are like brother and sister.</i>

484
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:14,422
<i>They didn't seem that close.</i>

485
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:15,505
<i>Go.</i>

486
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:18,301
I'll show him out and be right back.

487
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:21,804
<i>I couldn't hear everything,
but they argued for a while,</i>

488
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:24,432
<i>and then he scooped her up and took off.</i>

489
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:31,981
- You're not going anywhere.
- Get out of my way!

490
00:36:32,064 --> 00:36:34,650
Get out of the car before Madam sees you!

491
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:38,487
Why are you doing this? I have to go!

492
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:39,906
No, you do not!

493
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:51,000
Get out.

494
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:12,230
I told you to sit tight.

495
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:13,313
"Sit tight"?

496
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:18,110
- How can I? I'm not nailed down.
- Then what are you going to do?

497
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:21,113
I was going to come up with something
on the way...

498
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:22,197
Get inside.

499
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,284
- Come on.
- Let's go.

500
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:28,120
Eo Heung!

501
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:33,542
Get back inside. Now.

502
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:36,462
- Get inside.
- Yes, ma'am. He's going, of course.

503
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:40,925
- Keep walking.
- Come on, let's go.

504
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:46,013
Did you ask the police to track down
the out-of-towners who left the area?

505
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:50,017
The local precinct said they'd cooperate,

506
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:54,730
and I've sent them the security footage
from the House of Ohjuk as you instructed.

507
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:59,735
Ho-ja, what are you going to do
if you find him?

508
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,112
What do you think?

509
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:03,823
That bastard stole my precious grandchild.

510
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:09,203
If I get my hands on him,
I won't let him off lightly.

511
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:24,093
No way. A designer store
out here in the middle of nowhere?

512
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,263
JIBANGSI

513
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:28,389
Let's go.

514
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:37,773
Help me! I've been kidnapped!

515
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:38,858
Oh, my shoe!

516
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:43,821
I've been kidnapped! Please help me!

517
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:45,573
Can anyone hear me?

518
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:49,368
Hello? Can anyone hear me?

519
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,412
Hey.

520
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:58,127
THE PRIDE OF NAMWON
KIM YOUNG-WOONG SPECIAL CONCERT

521
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:07,178
Wait, sir! Please help me, sir!

522
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:10,431
Why's the mayor
let this lunatic out of the hospital?

523
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:12,391
She'll drive down our land values.

524
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:21,734
Welcome...

525
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:28,032
Pick whatever you want.

526
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:37,083
With your fair complexion,
anything would look good on you.

527
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:42,171
Can I borrow your phone?

528
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:43,130
Sorry?

529
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,257
Your phone.

530
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:46,341
What?

531
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:48,094
Oh, my phone...

532
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:52,014
- Your phone. Quickly.
- Sure.

533
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:02,983
- Where's the fitting room?
- Over there.

534
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:10,699
- Got any men's underwear?
- No.

535
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:18,666
Okay.

536
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:21,335
Zero-one-zero-one-five...

537
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:26,507
Wait. One, five...

538
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:30,052
What? Why can't I remember?

539
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:31,512
This is driving me mad!

540
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:32,847
One-five...

541
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,515
Please, God!

542
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:39,103
Please let me remember.

543
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:41,439
FITTING ROOM

544
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:45,067
I'm sure she'll be out in a second.

545
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:48,195
- Are there windows in there?
- No. No windows.

546
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:51,573
Oh my.

547
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:52,949
Gosh.

548
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:57,663
Good heavens.

549
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:02,835
Please help me remember. Please!

550
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:21,812
Please pick up.

551
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:26,358
THIS IS JAE-MI

552
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:29,153
What are you doing? Hurry up already.

553
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:33,282
What are you doing?

554
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:41,915
Hey, hurry...

555
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:50,007
Wow, you look so pretty.
Do you like the dress?

556
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,842
You look so lovely.

557
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:54,178
Excuse me.

558
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:55,721
- Yes?
- But could I get a bag?

559
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:57,389
You want a bag? Yes, here.

560
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:59,642
- You can throw out mine.
- Okay.

561
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:04,772
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

562
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:08,400
What? Let's go then.

563
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:10,027
Okay, let's go.

564
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:12,571
One second. Ma'am.

565
00:42:15,574 --> 00:42:16,909
She swiped this.

566
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:19,870
Gosh, my phone. I completely forgot.

567
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:21,664
Oops! I didn't notice either.

568
00:42:22,164 --> 00:42:23,874
Oops, indeed. Let's get going.

569
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:13,090
NAMWON
THE CULTURAL CITY OF KOREA

570
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:22,367
Please.

571
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:27,456
- Please.
<i>- Please.</i>

572
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:35,756
Wait a minute. My phone.

573
00:44:37,716 --> 00:44:38,759
Where is it?

574
00:44:40,135 --> 00:44:41,512
Where did I put it?

575
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:43,806
Yikes, you're still looking jittery.

576
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:47,643
- Have some tea to calm your nerves.
- No, wait.

577
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:48,894
Where's my phone?

578
00:44:48,977 --> 00:44:51,689
You left it in your car earlier. Here.

579
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:55,317
Let me see.

580
00:44:56,443 --> 00:44:59,196
NEW VOICEMAIL
3 MISSED CALLS

581
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:05,911
Yes, she did borrow my phone, but...

582
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:09,957
No, I don't know where she's headed.

583
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:15,045
Yes, she was with a young guy.

584
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:25,389
<i>Sweetie, I'm headed to Namwon.</i>

585
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:27,266
<i>In Jeolla Province.</i>

586
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:29,810
You said you'd chase me

587
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:33,647
to the ends of the earth if I ran away.

588
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:35,857
Can I

589
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:38,402
hold you to that?

590
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:40,279
I'll be waiting.

591
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:43,407
I love you.

592
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:36,168
That lowlife bastard.

593
00:46:36,752 --> 00:46:38,378
When I get my hands on you,

594
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:41,048
you're dead meat!

595
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:56,104
30 YEARS OF TRADITION
SUNDAE SOUP OF FORTUNE

596
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:00,901
<i>You have reached your...</i>

597
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:02,277
We're here. Let's go in.

598
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:06,949
I'm not hungry.

599
00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:08,367
You're coming anyway.

600
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:11,662
I don't want to eat.

601
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:14,915
You're coming anyway.
The guy I'm looking for is here.

602
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:18,335
Work with me here, okay?

603
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:20,921
A hostage works with their kidnapper?

604
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:25,300
The more you cooperate,

605
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:27,553
the shorter our journey will be.

606
00:47:28,428 --> 00:47:32,808
Well, with a bit of luck,
it might even end here.

607
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:48,907
Oh no.

608
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,993
If only you'd gotten here earlier.

609
00:47:51,076 --> 00:47:54,371
The kitchen is closing. I'm so sorry.

610
00:47:55,163 --> 00:47:59,293
Our last orders are at 9:30 p.m.

611
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:01,003
I'm so sorry.

612
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:08,176
I drove six hours to get here
with my pregnant wife

613
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:10,554
so she could have your <i>sundae</i> soup.

614
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:13,348
Please help us out.

615
00:48:13,432 --> 00:48:16,894
My God, six hours?

616
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:20,022
Let me check if there's any soup left.

617
00:48:20,105 --> 00:48:23,275
Go ahead and sit over there.

618
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:24,568
Well, I never.

619
00:48:26,445 --> 00:48:31,658
<i>I don't know if there's any soup left</i>

620
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:37,831
What was that?

621
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:40,667
What? I'm just playing along
with your fake pregnancy.

622
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:44,087
Why do I have to be your wife?

623
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:45,964
You once wanted to be so badly.

624
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:48,091
I was naive then. I don't want you now.

625
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:49,968
- And you think I do?
- Why you...

626
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:54,514
We're staying until tomorrow afternoon.

627
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:56,558
No way. Why would I?

628
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:58,393
Goodness me.

629
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:02,731
It looks amazing. Right, honey?

630
00:49:03,482 --> 00:49:05,567
Since you came such a long way,

631
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:09,112
I gave you some extra liver and intestine.

632
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:11,031
You didn't have to do that.

633
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:13,992
He won't be eating any.
He can't stand the smell.

634
00:49:15,243 --> 00:49:18,080
He says it's barbaric
to eat animal intestines.

635
00:49:19,581 --> 00:49:23,460
Jeez, I wish you'd told me sooner.

636
00:49:23,543 --> 00:49:24,920
No, it's all right.

637
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:28,256
I can have them both.
I am eating for two, after all.

638
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:32,260
I'd never have guessed you were pregnant.

639
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:33,970
How far along?

640
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:35,722
Sorry?

641
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:38,100
About two or three months? Well...

642
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:40,310
He has no idea. He's not the father.

643
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:44,898
Gee, I'm sorry.

644
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:46,733
I was being nosy.

645
00:49:47,401 --> 00:49:49,987
My daughter-in-law is due next month,

646
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:53,740
but she still refuses
to leave the kitchen.

647
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:55,367
She's a workaholic.

648
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:57,703
Bro, clean up table three!

649
00:49:57,786 --> 00:49:59,746
Dad, the kitchen's closed.

650
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,039
All right.

651
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:02,791
Are those your sons?

652
00:50:02,874 --> 00:50:04,751
They used to live away,

653
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:08,088
but then I got sick
and collapsed last year,

654
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:10,132
so they all moved back here.

655
00:50:10,215 --> 00:50:13,093
They're so good to me.
You can't even imagine.

656
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:15,178
What happened to you?

657
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:17,597
Just a minor stroke. No big deal.

658
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:19,808
I'm all better now.

659
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:23,812
Your hair...

660
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:26,064
- My hair?
- You got something there.

661
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:28,108
Let me.

662
00:50:29,317 --> 00:50:31,778
Ouch! That hurt.

663
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:34,780
I got it.

664
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:36,575
Enjoy your soup.

665
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:48,253
Dad, I told you we'd finish up here.
You should go home already.

666
00:50:50,088 --> 00:50:53,008
You're a stubborn old man, aren't you?

667
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:56,011
Your physical therapy
is in two days' time, okay?

668
00:50:56,094 --> 00:50:57,262
Yes, I know.

669
00:50:57,345 --> 00:51:00,348
Dad, you got the bill wrong
for table eight.

670
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:03,518
It wasn't a mistake. It was intentional.

671
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:05,771
A student discount. Right, Father?

672
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:08,815
She's the only one who understands me.

673
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:13,570
You love your daughter-in-law
more than you love me, don't you?

674
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:16,323
What kind of silly question is that?

675
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:25,332
With the bottle of soju,
your total comes to 20,000 won.

676
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:26,625
Shit, where is it?

677
00:51:30,629 --> 00:51:32,130
- What?
- My wallet.

678
00:51:33,548 --> 00:51:35,801
- Check the car.
- No, I put it in my pocket...

679
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:39,429
I think I left it at the gas station.

680
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:42,265
- Got cash?
- What do you think?

681
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:43,183
Right.

682
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:44,976
You know what? It's fine.

683
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:50,065
You came all this way,
so it's on the house.

684
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:52,234
You should go look for your wallet.

685
00:51:53,693 --> 00:51:54,945
Well, then,

686
00:51:55,028 --> 00:51:59,199
since you're being so generous,
could you let us stay the night too?

687
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:02,119
I've been drinking, so I can't drive.

688
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:18,635
Aren't you going to ask

689
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,429
why we're here,

690
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:24,349
and why I wanted to stay the night?

691
00:52:26,643 --> 00:52:27,643
Not interested.

692
00:52:35,777 --> 00:52:37,654
Been a while since we laid together.

693
00:52:43,451 --> 00:52:45,579
You remembered I don't eat intestines.

694
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:48,081
- I'm going to scream.
- Why?

695
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:53,378
I could wake up this entire family
yelling that I've been kidnapped.

696
00:52:54,087 --> 00:52:55,087
Leave me alone.

697
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:58,717
Fine. I'm going to sleep.

698
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:04,514
Don't think about running away.

699
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:07,142
You know I'm a light sleeper.

700
00:54:04,115 --> 00:54:05,200
Why should I care?

701
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:07,243
Don't go.

702
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:12,499
Don't go.

703
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:17,087
Don't... don't go.

704
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:22,634
Don't go.

705
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:25,512
Please don't go.

706
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:28,765
Don't go.

707
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:31,767
