1
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:21,813
<i>I heard that God loves children,</i>

2
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:25,483
<i>but since he can't watch over each one,</i>

3
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:27,027
<i>he created moms.</i>

4
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:29,112
- Hello. Welcome.
- Hello.

5
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:32,574
<i>But he didn't make enough moms,</i>

6
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:33,867
<i>so unfortunately,</i>

7
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:36,911
<i>those of us here
must wait for a mom to choose us.</i>

8
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:44,836
<i>So what kind of child
is a mom looking for?</i>

9
00:00:44,919 --> 00:00:47,672
You're so sweet. What is your name?

10
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:49,507
I'm Jo Jae-mi!

11
00:00:49,591 --> 00:00:50,759
<i>Maybe a sweet child?</i>

12
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:53,802
He's so happy.

13
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,976
<i>Or maybe,</i>

14
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:02,145
<i>a pretty child?</i>

15
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:08,860
"She was a beautiful princess
who looked just like the queen."

16
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:09,943
Oh, my.

17
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,947
You look just like a doll.

18
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:24,626
<i>And if they don't want
a sweet or pretty child...</i>

19
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:32,884
The babies are crying a lot.
Is something wrong with them?

20
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:34,010
I wonder too.

21
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,429
I really don't like sad kids.

22
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:39,349
<i>Don't cry, baby</i>

23
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:41,184
<i>Smile, baby</i>

24
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:45,730
<i>La-la-la-la, let's dance and have fun</i>

25
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:49,984
<i>...how about a happy, cheerful child
who never cries, even when sad?</i>

26
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:51,986
What a good baby.

27
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:54,531
You are adorable.

28
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:59,619
<i>Looks like I'll never have a mom</i>

29
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:02,747
<i>in this life.</i>

30
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:06,126
<i>That's why I've decided</i>

31
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:09,504
<i>that if I can't have one, I'll become one.</i>

32
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:14,134
When I grow up, I want to be a mom!

33
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:22,392
Don't laugh. I said don't laugh.

34
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,269
Stop laughing!

35
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:28,231
You really outdid yourself there.

36
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:31,359
"If I can't have a mom, I'll become one"?

37
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:34,779
That's so you, Jae-mi.

38
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:38,366
But you know what?

39
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:39,784
You can never

40
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:41,994
become a mom.

41
00:02:42,453 --> 00:02:43,705
Love flows downward.

42
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,583
You need to experience love to give love.

43
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:50,461
Love-starved people like us
can pass nothing onto our children.

44
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,440
You were right.

45
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,150
About what?

46
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,403
That love flows downward.

47
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:19,073
You need to experience love to give love.

48
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,450
Turns out you were right.

49
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:23,578
Are you some kind of prophet?

50
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:27,040
Hey, that was...

51
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:30,668
Sing me a song.

52
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:34,505
Your words foretold my misfortune.

53
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:37,383
So who knows?
If you wish for my happiness,

54
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,594
maybe I could be happy someday.

55
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:46,768
All right then.
What shall I sing to wish you happiness?

56
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:51,522
<i>You were created to receive...</i>

57
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:56,027
Hey, that song's just perfect for you.

58
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,036
- Damn it.
- Wait. Were you being serious?

59
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:06,537
Yes, dead serious.

60
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,044
Jeez.

61
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:24,264
<i>You were created</i>

62
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:28,142
<i>To receive the greatest love</i>

63
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:31,312
<i>You feel this love</i>

64
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,148
<i>In every part of your life</i>

65
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:36,901
- It's not a joke.
- Do you think I'm joking?

66
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,987
At least try and sound sincere.

67
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,321
I am being sincere.

68
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,949
- Whatever. Start over.
- Damn.

69
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:02,719
<i>You were created</i>

70
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:06,389
<i>To receive the greatest love</i>

71
00:05:08,099 --> 00:05:11,311
<i>You feel this love</i>

72
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:16,357
<i>In every part of your life</i>

73
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:27,410
<i>You were created</i>

74
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:30,538
<i>To receive the greatest love</i>

75
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:36,210
<i>You feel this love</i>

76
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:41,716
<i>In every part of your life</i>

77
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:09,452
{\an8}MR. PLANKTON

78
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:11,537
Where are you going?

79
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:14,165
- Roll down the window.
- Come on.

80
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:16,125
- Hey, gentlemen.
- Hey, honey!

81
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,460
You can find me here.

82
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:21,255
I wanted a cheap motel,
and the GPS brought us here.

83
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:26,719
- Hey, handsome.
- It looks like we're almost there.

84
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:29,305
It's right there.

85
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,808
ROCK-BOTTOM MOTEL

86
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:44,070
There's only one bed.
Are you okay with this?

87
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:46,781
Yes, that's it, baby. Harder, baby!

88
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:48,199
- Harder?
- Yes, harder!

89
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:49,282
Harder?

90
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:52,035
Well...

91
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:54,037
I'm coming!

92
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:56,040
No! Not yet!

93
00:06:58,876 --> 00:06:59,877
Don't come!

94
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,135
Oh, jeez.

95
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:14,016
Hey, snap out of it.

96
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:21,732
What was that?

97
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:33,828
OWNER: YOO GI-HO

98
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:36,664
That bastard's car is in this guy's name?

99
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:38,749
"Works at Hae Jo Errand House"?

100
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,710
<i>Hey, lackey.</i>

101
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,173
- Yes, boss?
- That punk, Hae Jo. What's he after?

102
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:48,634
Why did he travel
from Jeolla to Gyeongsang overnight?

103
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:54,140
Why do you think he came to the coast,
then went into the mountains?

104
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:56,767
Well, the guy I spoke to
had no idea either.

105
00:07:56,851 --> 00:08:00,396
He said he'd try
to suss him out if he got hold of him.

106
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:04,275
Right. That reminds me
of something he once said.

107
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:05,693
"You think..."

108
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:07,862
...that's why I stay?

109
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:10,072
- "I have nowhere to go..."
- ...so I stay put.

110
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,283
I recall him saying that kind of nonsense.

111
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,872
Sounds like he's trying
to teach a cat to bark.

112
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:20,541
He's a total lunatic.

113
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:31,093
Take it, dude.
It might be that guy calling back.

114
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,178
Okay, boss.

115
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:34,846
Hello?

116
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:37,892
Yes, this is he. Who?

117
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:40,394
"Chae Seung-hyeok"?

118
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:42,855
I'm out of that industry.

119
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:47,109
I used to handle missing person cases.

120
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:50,947
Keep it on, even if it's annoying.

121
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,030
Will do, boss.

122
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:55,952
Man, I'm fucking exhausted.

123
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,037
How long until we arrive?

124
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:01,082
We're almost there.
About an hour, I'd say.

125
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:02,416
So half an hour?

126
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:06,379
Pardon? Of course, boss.

127
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:34,489
Damn it.

128
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:51,464
Looking for these?

129
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,720
Don't touch my stuff.

130
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:57,805
I didn't. It was on the floor...

131
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,433
Don't be such a brat.

132
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,366
Since you're up early,
let's go somewhere together.

133
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,827
It'd be kind of boring to go alone.

134
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:22,079
I'm off to bed now.

135
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,122
Hey!

136
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:33,382
Let's just spend some time together. Okay?

137
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,676
I know where all the local beauties are.

138
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:38,304
I'll wait for you.

139
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:40,973
So get ready and meet me outside.

140
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:50,691
See? Look at all these beauties!
I can literally smell the ocean.

141
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:55,946
Busan's early morning fish market
is a must-see attraction.

142
00:10:56,864 --> 00:10:59,867
You can tell how fresh they are
by looking at the scales.

143
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:03,996
Eight cod. Five crates.

144
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,583
They are 36,000 won. Next, 10 cod.

145
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,085
What are you looking to buy?

146
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,586
Whatever you like.

147
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:14,048
How do you like your fish?
Raw? Grilled? In a soup?

148
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,217
I like <i>ramyeon.</i>

149
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:20,763
<i>Ramyeon</i> noodles?
Soup it is, then. Soup-erb!

150
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:25,017
Now where's the sea bass?

151
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:31,107
HAS KKARI CONTACTED YOU?

152
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,234
- Coming through!
- Hey!

153
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,778
- Be careful.
- Step aside!

154
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:37,863
Hey! Watch where you're going.

155
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:39,865
That was close. Gimme that!

156
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:41,826
Come on, you punk.

157
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:51,585
Invincible Lotte! Go, Lotte, win it all!

158
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:54,463
Don't get distracted.
Hold my hand tight, okay?

159
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,047
Okay!

160
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,689
I'm coming. Let go of me.

161
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:13,858
- Just come, you brat.
- I said...

162
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:16,318
- Hello there!
- Hello.

163
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,039
Hey, sis!

164
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:31,667
- What can I get you today?
- Hey, come here.

165
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:33,668
Here.

166
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,756
Try this. It's salt-grilled mackerel.

167
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,049
There's a bone...

168
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:43,220
Chew before you swallow!
Can he get some rice? Quick.

169
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,346
Sure. Here.

170
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,933
Here. Just swallow this.
Don't chew the rice, just swallow.

171
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,020
I can't swallow...

172
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:55,107
We'll take five of these. Sliced.

173
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:59,028
Goodness, your son is good-looking.
He must take after his mother.

174
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:01,322
What are you talking about, lady?

175
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:04,241
Look at that face.
He looks just like me at that age!

176
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,452
- What went wrong?
- Hey.

177
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:08,913
This face is your future.

178
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:11,582
- Says who?
- Says me! You punk.

179
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:14,001
You're like two peas in a pod.
Temper and all.

180
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:15,544
- Hey!
- Hey!

181
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,340
- Just hurry up already.
- My goodness.

182
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:21,467
This looks nice. Look, it's huge.

183
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,595
Look at this mackerel. It looks so meaty.

184
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,567
Mr. Ko!

185
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:40,694
Hae Jo!

186
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:51,789
Mr. Ko.

187
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:57,795
Hae Jo.

188
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:04,134
Damn. Where did they go
leaving me here all alone?

189
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:11,517
Oh, right.

190
00:14:16,397 --> 00:14:17,397
It's here.

191
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,023
It's still here.

192
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,280
Snap out of it, you idiot!

193
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:27,283
Are you relieved that he didn't ditch you?

194
00:14:28,659 --> 00:14:30,035
God, you crazy idiot.

195
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:33,664
I'm losing my mind.

196
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:36,458
- What's good today?
- The flounder's nice.

197
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:38,294
This one looks like Jae-mi.

198
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,296
The flat face and wide-set eyes.

199
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:45,758
Too small.

200
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:47,386
Nice, silver pomfret.

201
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:48,929
I think I'll poach them.

202
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:51,640
I'll take three. No, I'll take five.

203
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,183
Yes. All right.

204
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,727
Sea bass!

205
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,729
Give me a meaty one.

206
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:59,815
A nice big one fresh off the boat, okay?

207
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:00,983
It's for a soup.

208
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,067
Sure. Right away.

209
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:05,029
And a longarm octopus.
The biggest one you've got.

210
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:07,114
Enough already. We'll be stuffed.

211
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:08,741
- And some horse mackerel?
- No.

212
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:10,326
And a box of horse mackerel.

213
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,411
- Then why ask?
- That'll be 90,000 won!

214
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:14,163
All right, 90,000 won and...

215
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:20,002
Actually... I'm sorry. I forgot.

216
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:23,464
We have to do some hiking,
so we can't lug a crate.

217
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:26,300
I'll just take ten of them
in a plastic bag.

218
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,470
And silver pomfret are too small.

219
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,640
The season's almost over.

220
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:33,849
I'll just take two.

221
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:37,394
Octopus! Yes, the longarm octopus.
No need to take it out.

222
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:39,063
Are you kidding me?

223
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,398
- We'll take them.
- No.

224
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:43,525
- It's fine. How much?
- 30,000.

225
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,069
- 30,000?
- Hey, you!

226
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:50,282
You think you can
pull a fast one on a pro, huh?

227
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:54,370
If you try to pawn that off on me,
you'll be fishing one-handed!

228
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,789
Give me the one I picked.

229
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:59,375
You think you can scam me,
you cheap-ass crook?

230
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:01,961
What did you say?

231
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,670
"Pull a fast one"?

232
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:05,297
"Cheap-ass crook"?

233
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:08,717
- Hey, stop.
- Give me the one I picked, come on.

234
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,427
Forget it. Get lost!

235
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:12,388
Don't ruin our morning.

236
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:16,100
- Hey, asshole!
- That is enough!

237
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:17,434
- Out of my way!
- Hey!

238
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,645
- Hey, you!
- Fuck.

239
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:21,605
I left the house at the crack of dawn

240
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:24,191
to come here
and treat my son for the first time!

241
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:28,529
How dare you pull a switcheroo
with the fish I bought for my dear son?

242
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:30,030
Fuck!

243
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:34,702
- You...
- You bastard!

244
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:36,662
Good grief.

245
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,163
- Stop.
- What do you want?

246
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,541
- You...
- You bastard!

247
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,293
Goddamn it.

248
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:49,674
Get off me.

249
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,224
Get him!

250
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:01,729
Hey! Damn you!

251
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:10,821
Die!

252
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:18,787
Run for it!

253
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:20,538
You little...

254
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,584
- Get them!
- This way!

255
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:27,671
Let's see. Wow!

256
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,507
Goddammit.

257
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:35,262
I wanted to prepare
a healthy, delicious meal fit for a king.

258
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,139
But what the hell is this?

259
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,516
I told you. <i>Ramyeon</i> is my favorite.

260
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:42,018
Here.

261
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,107
Fuck! It's hot.

262
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:53,447
You're a bit of a klutz, aren't you?

263
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:54,530
Hey.

264
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:56,491
Right.

265
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:00,287
You sure can throw a punch though.

266
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,915
You didn't even flinch at the fish knives.

267
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:05,918
You must've led quite the life.

268
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:09,213
Today was just business as usual.

269
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,507
Getting into fights

270
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,009
and smashing things up.

271
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,677
Just rolling with the punches.

272
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:27,856
You must've been through so much,
growing up all on your own.

273
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:34,279
And you've achieved so much. Well done.

274
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,091
Shit, that damn smoke.

275
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:17,156
Hey, you know, earlier, that idiot...

276
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:19,658
You know that ugly knife-wielding guy?

277
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:22,369
I caught his head
with the scoop net for you.

278
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:24,496
I saved your life, kiddo.

279
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,375
This is why team fights are better, right?

280
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:29,459
It was fun!

281
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:31,628
A scoop net is a lame weapon though.

282
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,297
It's always those sneaky...

283
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,798
Sneaky cowards who win.

284
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:37,467
Yes, so you know.

285
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:40,888
Okay! Let's drink to that.

286
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,027
Get it together, Jo Jae-mi.

287
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:57,529
You need to go and live your life.

288
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,335
I'm sorry.

289
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:13,420
Shoot!

290
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:17,423
Damn it!

291
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:41,281
But,

292
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:44,952
where do I go?

293
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:49,122
<i>Don't set any kind
of destinations in life.</i>

294
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:52,209
<i>If you lose your way
while wandering aimlessly,</i>

295
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:55,254
<i>it doesn't set you adrift.</i>

296
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,214
<i>It just makes you a drifter.</i>

297
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:00,592
That bastard.

298
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,454
You're wasted. Come on, let's go.

299
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:30,538
So,

300
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:34,418
how long do you have left?

301
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,920
What?

302
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:41,800
You're taking opioids.

303
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:49,266
It's a narcotic pain reliever
often given to stage-four cancer patients.

304
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:53,603
I took something similar
for a few years in the past, so I know.

305
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:55,689
You do know you're way out of line?

306
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:57,441
And Jae-mi doesn't have a clue?

307
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:02,321
Jeez, you fool. Seriously?

308
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:03,238
What the hell?

309
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,656
You are such a fool.

310
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:08,827
Kid, you need to tell her. You have to.

311
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:11,038
How fucking ridiculous. Hey, mister.

312
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:14,958
Just because I'm being nice
doesn't mean we're close.

313
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:17,878
Do you really think I'm your son?

314
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:20,088
We are strangers. Total strangers.

315
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:21,923
Your nosiness is irritating.

316
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:25,260
I'm worried about you
and that's irritating me too!

317
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:36,563
What if you really are my son?
Like, for real.

318
00:22:41,234 --> 00:22:43,028
- No, that's...
- Damn it.

319
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:48,283
I mean,
as if my nasty disease wasn't enough,

320
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:53,914
what if you inherited
my miserable life too?

321
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:55,456
Well?

322
00:22:56,416 --> 00:23:01,046
That's what's got me
so scared and worried, okay?

323
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:05,967
I'm just so worried, Hae Jo.

324
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:07,677
Damn it.

325
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,641
What's wrong with you?

326
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:14,643
Hey, boy!

327
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:17,562
- I'd give you everything!
- What's wrong with him?

328
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,773
But I have nothing.

329
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:21,149
Hey! Fine!

330
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:25,987
Take this arm of mine!
I'll give it to you now.

331
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:28,615
- Shut up, will you?
- My arm!

332
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:32,119
If this arm could cure you,
I'd give it to you right now!

333
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:34,204
- He's my son.
- He's had one too many.

334
00:23:34,287 --> 00:23:35,287
Hey!

335
00:23:35,872 --> 00:23:36,957
Hey, son!

336
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:40,001
I really am willing to give you my arm!

337
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:55,350
That's the spot.

338
00:23:58,478 --> 00:23:59,688
That feels so good.

339
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:04,567
What the hell?

340
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:05,902
It's that prick again.

341
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:08,447
- Fine, take it.
- Sorry, boss.

342
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,873
Hey, lackey. Let me pour you one! Come on!

343
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:24,921
Listen, how many times
do I have to tell you?

344
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:26,339
I don't know who that is.

345
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:28,592
Who the heck is Chae Seung-hyeok?

346
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:30,218
Son of a bitch!

347
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:32,721
"Son of a bitch"?

348
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,389
Not you. Chae Seung-hyeok.

349
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:37,893
That bastard Chae Seung-hyeok
kidnapped my bride.

350
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,394
Kidnapped your bride?

351
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:40,729
<i>That's right.</i>

352
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:44,316
That bastard showed up in your Jeep
and took Jae-mi against her will.

353
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,652
- Jae-mi?
<i>- Fun, my ass!</i>

354
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,279
Fun doesn't pay the bills!

355
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:52,324
Your ass? No, blame her ass.

356
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:54,993
- Jae-mi?
- "Looking for my bride, Jo Jae-mi"?

357
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:57,370
Boss, the bride's name is Jae-mi.

358
00:24:57,954 --> 00:24:59,164
{\an8}Jae-mi?

359
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:01,750
- Are you with someone?
- The bride I kidnapped.

360
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,251
Fuck.

361
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:06,421
Fuck. Jae-mi?

362
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:16,598
- Hello?
<i>- Hey, ma'am.</i>

363
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:20,894
What the hell?
Don't you know what time it is?

364
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:26,316
I was just wondering
if Seung-hyeok called you to ask about me.

365
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:28,777
Do you guys think I'm your messenger?

366
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,404
Why are you guys
asking me about each other?

367
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:32,988
<i>I'm hanging up.</i>

368
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:42,415
Hold on. Does he know Hae Jo's real name?

369
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,626
Wow, this is...

370
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:46,752
Wow.

371
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,505
Fuck.

372
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:50,589
Hold on.

373
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:54,636
So, Hae Jo and Chae Seung-hyeok

374
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,680
are the same person.

375
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:58,723
Hang on. Let's think.

376
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:00,892
If he took <i>Jokduri</i>'s bride...

377
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:07,190
Wow, that means those morons
are barking up the wrong tree.

378
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:36,970
Can she even breathe?

379
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:40,098
Jeez.

380
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,019
What the hell?

381
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:46,645
What?

382
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:49,064
She's gone?

383
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:50,734
Idiot.

384
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:52,110
God, you scared me.

385
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:58,700
Yeah, that's how anyone would react
when a person suddenly disappears.

386
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:00,410
I'm no different.

387
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:04,414
Were you scared because I was gone?

388
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:05,498
Shut your trap.

389
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:09,419
Are you relieved to see me again?

390
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:12,589
Gross! You smell like fish. Go away!

391
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:16,885
The shower didn't help.

392
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:18,553
We were at the fish market.

393
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:20,764
Have you been drinking?

394
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:23,975
Hey, hear me out. It was so ridiculous.

395
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:25,852
He dragged me around by my wrist,

396
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:28,355
had me carrying his shit like a pack mule,

397
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:30,231
then made me choke on a fishbone.

398
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:33,151
We also got into a fight
with the fishmongers,

399
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:35,654
and got soaked in smelly water. I mean...

400
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:38,448
Sounds like a blast.

401
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:40,909
A blast? It was a total shitshow.

402
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:44,954
He was right.

403
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:47,999
He said team fights
are more fun than one-on-ones.

404
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:50,251
It was 2 against 17.

405
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:52,754
I've fought 17 men alone, but not...

406
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:53,880
That's funny.

407
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:56,966
- How so?
- You weren't like that before.

408
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:59,928
"My team, your team.
My stuff, your stuff."

409
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,805
You used to hate taking sides.

410
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:10,814
- Are you sulking?
- What? Why would I be?

411
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:12,691
'Cause we left you out of the fun.

412
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:14,776
I'm not a kid. That would be childish.

413
00:28:14,859 --> 00:28:16,528
- You totally are childish.
- Hey!

414
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:30,041
Oh, the test results might not be ready
by the end of the day.

415
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:32,460
So?

416
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,671
So we don't have to rush back today.

417
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:36,756
I heard there's a storm coming.

418
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,342
Staying a little longer won't do any harm.

419
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:43,638
You like that guy, too.

420
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,016
Are you thinking...

421
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,269
Damn, I just remembered.

422
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:53,690
You need to try this.
I asked them for a doggy bag for you.

423
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:55,442
It's fried shrimp.

424
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:58,570
It's better when it's hot, but here. Try.

425
00:28:58,653 --> 00:28:59,946
Hey!

426
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:02,741
You know I'm allergic to shellfish!

427
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:06,494
- Damn.
- Oh, sorry.

428
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:09,664
But you know,

429
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:13,084
it's easy to forget after three years.

430
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,795
Still, no need to swat it away.

431
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:17,505
Right, I forgot too.

432
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:20,759
How uncaring and inattentive you were.

433
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:23,052
That's just mean.

434
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:26,306
Our three years together
were the worst of my life.

435
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:28,391
I can't believe I forgot about that.

436
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:30,894
Then you should've gone with your husband.

437
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:33,646
I'm deeply regretting it right now.

438
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,482
Then go. Go back to him.

439
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:39,194
Hey! Whose fault is it
that I'm in this mess now?

440
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:40,320
What's the matter?

441
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:43,281
You believe in love,
so put your faith in that fool again.

442
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:46,951
Well, if he gives me another chance,
I'll leave and not look back!

443
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:47,869
Then go!

444
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:49,829
- I won't stop you. Go.
- I will!

445
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:52,457
Seriously.

446
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:40,379
What...

447
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:52,600
Fucking hell. I can't believe this.

448
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:57,105
I've done all sorts of damage to people.
I've cut, shot, and maimed them.

449
00:30:57,188 --> 00:31:00,900
But I've never felt like
I was beating a dead horse before.

450
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:02,944
I'm finding it rather embarrassing.

451
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:07,574
I prefer to say that stuff happens,
and everyone makes mistakes.

452
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:09,284
You know what I mean?

453
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:15,290
So, there's no need for me
to make mincemeat out of that bastard.

454
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,083
That's right, boss.

455
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:19,544
It would be better to make kimchi...

456
00:31:21,212 --> 00:31:22,589
Eat this.

457
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:26,718
You're wrong, kiddo.

458
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:29,888
It seems you can't gauge
the situation yet since you're new.

459
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:32,015
In this line of work, we say,

460
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:33,641
"Revenge is simple math."

461
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:36,477
You need to think simply
to find the answer.

462
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:38,521
Okay, let's see.

463
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:43,484
Did that bastard Hae Jo ruin my wedding

464
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:44,569
or not?

465
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:47,614
Yes.

466
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:52,201
Did that bastard make plans with my bride
behind my back, or did he not?

467
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:55,538
Yes.

468
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:59,500
And did that bitch
conspire with that bastard

469
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:02,337
to go behind my back
and empty out my safe, or not?

470
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:10,637
What? You didn't know?

471
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:12,805
Okay.

472
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:14,849
Let me rephrase the question.

473
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:19,437
That bitch and that bastard
went behind my back and emptied my safe.

474
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:23,942
Now, am I fucking screwed,
or am I not fucking screwed?

475
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:29,405
Yes. See?

476
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:31,699
Think simply, and you'll get the answer.

477
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:34,577
So, who is to blame for this mess?

478
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:37,747
Hae Jo.

479
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:38,830
Bingo.

480
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:42,794
- Hey, Gong-su.
- Yes, boss?

481
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:45,421
Take this punk to the hospital
to get stitched up.

482
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:46,756
Got it, boss.

483
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:50,093
Hey, you little fucker. Get up already!

484
00:32:57,433 --> 00:32:59,686
That sigh could bring the house down.

485
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:03,271
What's that?

486
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,692
What happened to you?

487
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:09,278
Oh, this. It's nothing.
I tripped and fell.

488
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:13,074
You should've been careful.
Look what happened to your pretty face.

489
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,993
Are you off out to work?

490
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:16,703
Yeah, just some day labor.

491
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:19,247
The pay isn't much, but it keeps me busy.

492
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,624
I bet Hae Jo has conked out.

493
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:26,379
He'll wake up in a couple of hours or so.
He only sleeps a few hours at a time.

494
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:27,547
I see. All right.

495
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:31,843
Actually,

496
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:33,553
can I ask you a favor?

497
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:34,929
Yes, of course.

498
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,931
Well...

499
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:41,561
No matter what
the paternity test results say,

500
00:33:41,644 --> 00:33:45,064
I've decided to think of him as my son.

501
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:47,817
That being said,

502
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:51,029
I still want to play dad
for just a few more days.

503
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:53,990
Do you think you could try to persuade him

504
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,327
to stay here a little longer?

505
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:03,707
Please.

506
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:07,753
Sure.

507
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:09,881
I'll talk to him.

508
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:11,716
All right. Thanks.

509
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:16,262
See you later. Don't see me out.
Just make yourself at home.

510
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:19,432
Is there anything else you need me to do?

511
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:21,350
Oh, actually,

512
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:24,353
could you pick some angelica
and Fischer's ragwort?

513
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:26,939
Let's have wraps for dinner.

514
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:28,107
In leafy greens?

515
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:30,526
That's right. Pick as much as you like.

516
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:31,986
Okay, see you later!

517
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,154
See you!

518
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:39,618
<i>You see,</i>

519
00:34:40,578 --> 00:34:43,206
I really didn't want to bring this up,

520
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:45,290
but, by any chance,

521
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:47,877
do you know Heung's Kitchen?

522
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,546
I see, you don't.

523
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:54,634
Then you also don't know the master
of traditional Korean food, Bum Ho-ja.

524
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:56,803
I'm the family's sole male heir.

525
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:01,390
Okay, so? What do you want from...

526
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:03,601
Doctor! The anesthesia is wearing off.

527
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:04,852
Help me this once,

528
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:08,815
and I swear on my family's honor
that I'll repay you for your help.

529
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:10,942
As someone with experience, trust me.

530
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:12,151
Hae Jo, that shit...

531
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:16,864
Mess with Chae Seung-hyeok,
and your life will be ruined.

532
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,199
So heed my warning and...

533
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:19,325
No.

534
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:23,329
Whether my life gets ruined or not,
I'll deal with it.

535
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:25,540
So please, sir.

536
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,291
<i>You're the only one</i>

537
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:29,418
I can ask for help right now.

538
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:31,629
You're my only hope, Mr. Yoo Gi-ho.

539
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:34,048
<i>Please help me just this once, sir.</i>

540
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:36,676
<i>Please, sir. I beg you.</i>

541
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:39,511
<i>Sir, please.</i>

542
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:55,862
<i>How did she get hurt?</i>

543
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:59,031
Her skin has always healed so slowly.

544
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:04,305
Snap out of it! I must be going crazy!

545
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:10,144
I'll go settle up. So wait here, okay?

546
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,146
Wait.

547
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:15,358
I have a craving for banana milk
because I lost a lot of blood.

548
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:17,652
- Can I go to the store real quick?
- What?

549
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:21,280
You need strawberry milk for that,
you fucking idiot.

550
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:23,282
- Be quick.
- Okay.

551
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:27,161
- Get me a box of cigs while you're at it.
- Got it.

552
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:29,789
What a fucking moron.

553
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:39,924
They really kill people?

554
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:43,219
Those bastards will butcher anyone,
no matter who.

555
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:46,264
See how they fucked up my leg?

556
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:49,350
I am putting my life on the line
to help you.

557
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:53,729
If the address is correct,
I'll pay you one large bill right away.

558
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:56,232
Promise.

559
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:07,326
I'm giving you this info cheaply.

560
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:09,035
Sent.

561
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:12,540
Find them before we do

562
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:15,543
for everyone's sake
and to avoid bloodshed.

563
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:18,838
What are you muttering about?

564
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:21,507
Well, they don't have what I want.

565
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,509
- Hurry up.
- Coming.

566
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:25,219
They must be slacking off here.

567
00:38:33,936 --> 00:38:36,605
Hold on.

568
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:38,691
Mount Gudeok.

569
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:41,444
I should go straight to this place and...

570
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,993
Hey, you look familiar.

571
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:50,076
That day...

572
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:52,912
Hey, you.

573
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:55,082
You're the <i>jokduri</i> guy.

574
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,376
The <i>jokduri</i> guy from the precinct...

575
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,878
That's right! <i>Jokduri</i>!

576
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:00,838
It is you!

577
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:03,007
Oh, you know me?

578
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:04,925
Sure! We were cellmates.

579
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:08,763
We cheered you on
when you did that little striptease.

580
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:11,681
You remember!

581
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:13,642
Right. You guys are the thugs...

582
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:15,436
What was that?

583
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:17,605
I do recall meeting you, gentlemen.

584
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:19,565
Anyway,

585
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:21,525
I know Korea is fucking tiny,

586
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:23,444
but what a coincidence!

587
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:26,572
I know, right?

588
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,241
I guess I'm happy to see you again.

589
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:32,119
Please excuse me. I'm in a hurry.

590
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,043
About your kidnapped bride,

591
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:41,003
I really hope you find her.

592
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:42,713
- Good luck!
- Good luck, man!

593
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:44,173
Good luck!

594
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:46,509
Here's your hat back. Stand up straight!

595
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,429
- Careful.
- Good luck.

596
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:52,890
It's not that way.

597
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:55,017
- Oh boy.
- Man.

598
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:59,146
What a jackass.
No wonder his wife was stolen from him.

599
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,524
What's he going to do?

600
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,112
Just shut it.

601
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:08,322
Mount Gudeok! The hiking trail!

602
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,698
Hurry.

603
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:12,535
Go!

604
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:13,786
Not backward!

605
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:18,124
Forward!

606
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:29,885
Oh my gosh.

607
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:31,887
Son, you must be hungry.

608
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:34,265
Just give me a sec.

609
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:36,015
Check this out.

610
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:39,019
A healthy meal fit for a king.
It's almost ready.

611
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,326
Hey, honey!

612
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:09,966
Hey.

613
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:12,011
Weren't we here earlier?

614
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:15,556
Boss, we are going in the right direction,

615
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:19,894
but the GPS isn't working properly
'cause we're deep in the mountains.

616
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:21,228
Well, either way,

617
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:24,648
if we don't find him today,
we're burying you here, okay?

618
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:25,733
Fucking idiot!

619
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:27,275
Boss.

620
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:29,904
Let's just set the mountain on fire.

621
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:33,657
That prick will come bolting down,
and we'll catch him and finish...

622
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:36,994
You dumbass.
Are we trying to catch a raccoon?

623
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:39,163
Let's say we start a fire as you said.

624
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:44,043
That bastard could come down
this way, that way, or the other way,

625
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:45,211
so how would we know?

626
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:49,798
Is that head of yours just there
to keep your neck from wobbling?

627
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:52,551
I told you to read some books, didn't I?

628
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:54,220
Instead of picking on people...

629
00:42:00,976 --> 00:42:02,102
Excuse me, ma'am!

630
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:04,063
Can you help us?

631
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:06,731
Certainly.

632
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:11,278
We were told
there was a log cabin around here.

633
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:12,863
I'm terribly sorry

634
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:16,951
but this is my first time on this trail,
so I don't know either.

635
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:19,370
In that case,

636
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,914
I wonder if you know this...

637
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:25,709
You look

638
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:30,673
so much better in person.

639
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:38,389
- Fucking hell!
- Fuck!

640
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,724
My leg!

641
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:42,226
That little bitch.

642
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:45,187
Why did she have to show up here
all of a sudden?

643
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:48,274
Catch up with her!

644
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,863
- Run faster, you idiot!
- I got her!

645
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:57,616
- Ouch! That hurts!
- Boss!

646
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:02,580
Get up, you morons.
Get up, right this instant!

647
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:05,374
I can't believe you let her go!

648
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:07,793
Help!

649
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:12,006
Help me!

650
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:21,932
Did you hear that?

651
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,274
Jae-mi...

652
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:39,408
<i>Hey.</i>

653
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,200
<i>Hey, honey!</i>

654
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:51,462
Are you all right?
I told you to be careful.

655
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:56,300
Why are you doing chores?

656
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:00,638
Come on, Jae-mi.

657
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:03,349
Let's go inside and eat.

658
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:07,436
<i>No. Don't go.</i>

659
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:09,813
<i>Don't go.</i>

660
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:12,983
<i>No, don't go.</i>

661
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:14,652
<i>Don't go.</i>

662
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:18,030
<i>No, Jae-mi. Don't do this.</i>

663
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:22,576
Get up! We have to leave.

664
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,662
Come on. Get up!

665
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:26,955
You really are back? Aren't you?

666
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:28,582
- Wake up!
- Fuck.

667
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:31,251
There are some thugs
coming up here to get you!

668
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,128
Hurry up if you want to live. Shit!

669
00:44:33,212 --> 00:44:34,213
Fuck!

670
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:36,507
Damn it.

671
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:38,675
What the hell?

672
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:40,718
What?

673
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:52,189
- What the fuck?!
- Let's just go.

674
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:04,535
- A cabin?
- A cabin.

675
00:45:04,618 --> 00:45:06,412
Keep going straight up there.

676
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:07,538
Let's go!

677
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:09,289
- Yes, boss!
- Fuck.

678
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:16,338
Jae-mi.

679
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:25,013
Fuck, I need a break.

680
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,474
Hold on. Shit!

681
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:30,269
What are you idiots doing?
We're not on a damn picnic!

682
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:32,145
Move!

683
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:35,983
Damn, that's refreshing. Fuck yeah!

684
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:46,243
Hey, wait up!

685
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:48,619
Shit.

686
00:45:58,422 --> 00:45:59,548
Wait.

687
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:27,034
Well, what do we have here?

688
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:31,163
We meet again.
This can't be a coincidence.

689
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:33,957
Right.

690
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:39,004
So anyway,
what brings you guys to this mountain?

691
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:57,272
Damn.

692
00:46:57,356 --> 00:46:58,398
Shit.

693
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:00,358
- Let's go.
- Yes.

694
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:02,903
I'm here to finish someone off.

695
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:05,656
I'm here for the bastard who took my wife.

696
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:08,116
What? Hold on a second.

697
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:11,745
That must mean we're after the same guy.

698
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:15,040
Oh, I see.

699
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:19,378
You know what they say,
"The enemy of my enemy is my friend."

700
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:22,756
So, since we're friends now,
let's shake hands.

701
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:25,634
Eo Heung, doctor of traditional medicine.

702
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:27,135
- Eo Heung?
- Yes.

703
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:30,514
- Is that for real?
- Yes.

704
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:33,350
I thought you were clearing your throat.

705
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:38,689
Everyone freeze or he'll be paralyzed.

706
00:47:38,772 --> 00:47:40,399
- Fuck.
- Nobody dare move.

707
00:47:40,482 --> 00:47:45,529
If this goes in a centimeter deeper,
he'll be paralyzed from the neck down

708
00:47:45,612 --> 00:47:47,155
and going home in a chopper.

709
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:49,867
I'm sure you've seen
stuff like that in movies.

710
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:52,119
- Well, I can do it.
- You motherfucker!

711
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:56,331
- Sorry?
- Did you say, "Don't move, fuckers"?

712
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,332
Yes!

713
00:47:57,416 --> 00:47:58,709
Don't move, fuckers.

714
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:00,210
- Don't move.
- Mr. John Na.

715
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:02,254
Go inside now and get Jae-mi.

716
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:08,302
Don't move,
or you will become totally paralyzed.

717
00:48:09,928 --> 00:48:11,638
- "Stand to attention"?
- Yes!

718
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:14,057
- Fuck. Attention!
- Attention.

719
00:48:28,822 --> 00:48:30,532
TEST RESULTS
PATERNITY PROBABILITY...

720
00:48:42,794 --> 00:48:45,130
<i>It was almost impossible
to trace Ko Jae-geun.</i>

721
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:49,051
<i>He's been jumping
from place to place like a grasshopper.</i>

722
00:48:50,802 --> 00:48:51,802
Who are you?

723
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:56,767
<i>I'd lost a lot on the stock market,
so I was running low on cash.</i>

724
00:48:57,351 --> 00:49:00,020
You think you can
pull a fast one on a pro, huh?

725
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:02,481
Back in the day,
I had a bit of a bad habit.

726
00:49:02,564 --> 00:49:05,067
Long time no see.
Your son's been keeping you busy.

727
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:07,903
Come to that container over there for...

728
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:09,363
Okay, I'll buy some soju.

729
00:49:09,446 --> 00:49:11,490
- So are you game or not?
- Keep it down!

730
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:16,912
DEBT COLLECTION

731
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:20,540
At this rate,
we'll die before we can find that bastard.

732
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:21,708
Shit, hang on.

733
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:23,585
Hey. Keep still!

734
00:49:25,587 --> 00:49:27,547
B3-002/5 P.M.

735
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:37,808
Sorry to bother you even more,
but could you take us as far as the port?

736
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:41,603
It's worth five million won.

737
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,779
Are you sure it's worth looking for him?

738
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:52,531
Wait here. I won't be long.

739
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:57,035
Don't kill him, okay?
Just make him learn his lesson.

740
00:49:58,286 --> 00:49:59,705
Why look for him now?

741
00:50:25,647 --> 00:50:26,647
She's not here?

742
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:28,149
Jae-mi.

743
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:29,859
Boss.

744
00:50:30,235 --> 00:50:31,278
Jae-mi!

745
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:35,907
Jae-mi!

746
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:38,493
He's saying,
"Take the fucking needle out first!"

747
00:50:38,577 --> 00:50:40,245
<i>Jokduri</i>! Take the needle out!

748
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:43,957
It was all a lie.

749
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:45,041
What?

750
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:48,712
Paralysis, my ass.
You can move all you want.

751
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:49,795
What?

752
00:50:53,258 --> 00:50:55,260
You motherfucker.

753
00:50:55,343 --> 00:50:57,137
That acupuncture point is for kids.

754
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,765
- To stop them pooping their pants.
- Son of a bitch!

755
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:03,351
Using your acupuncture skills
to mess with people.

756
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:05,145
What the hell?

757
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:06,730
Back off, you idiots!

758
00:51:07,689 --> 00:51:10,567
Whoa. Jeez.

759
00:51:21,995 --> 00:51:22,995
Damn it.

760
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:26,249
Boss!

761
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:29,002
Boss, Hae Jo's on the phone.

762
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:31,463
- Hurry!
- That bastard Hae Jo called.

763
00:51:31,546 --> 00:51:33,090
- Quick!
- Move it!

764
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:37,385
You're on speaker.
My boss, Chil-seong, is here.

765
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:40,180
Chil-seong, chili sauce.
whatever your name is. Listen.

766
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:42,057
- Where is my Jae-mi...
- Quiet.

767
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:46,144
<i>Sounds like you've been
dragging Kkari all over to hunt me down.</i>

768
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:48,688
I'll tell you where I am. Meet me here.

769
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:52,901
But let Kkari go.

770
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:57,656
Look at you acting all cool.
You fucking clown.

771
00:51:57,739 --> 00:52:00,992
Once I track you down,
your minion's job here is done.

772
00:52:01,076 --> 00:52:03,954
Stop blabbering and give me your word.

773
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:05,247
All right, deal.

774
00:52:05,997 --> 00:52:06,997
So?

775
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:09,417
Where are you?

776
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:11,044
<i>Come quick.</i>

777
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:15,090
I don't have much time,
so I can't wait too long.

778
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:40,323
Fucking idiot.

779
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:48,623
- There's that fucking moron.
- What's he doing? Oh no!

780
00:52:51,626 --> 00:52:52,626
Get the money.

781
00:52:55,213 --> 00:52:56,631
Let go! You bastard.

782
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:03,346
Stop right there.

783
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:15,400
If you had fun with my money,
I deserve some interest.

784
00:53:15,483 --> 00:53:16,818
Hey, my arm!

785
00:53:16,902 --> 00:53:20,989
How about I take this arm of yours
as your interest payment?

786
00:53:21,072 --> 00:53:24,534
Hey, listen... Hear me out, Hae Jo.

787
00:53:24,618 --> 00:53:27,245
Will you please hear me out? Please!

788
00:53:34,377 --> 00:53:35,503
Hey, Hae Jo. I...

789
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:43,261
I'm sorry.

790
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:45,388
But you see, I...

791
00:53:48,141 --> 00:53:52,145
I swear, I wasn't trying
to steal the money from you.

792
00:53:53,271 --> 00:53:55,565
I was going to make more money
and return it.

793
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:57,734
For real.

794
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:00,111
Well,

795
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:03,365
other parents help their children
grow their money

796
00:54:03,448 --> 00:54:06,368
by investing in the stock market
and savings accounts.

797
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:08,954
But I...

798
00:54:10,455 --> 00:54:12,749
I've done nothing for my son.

799
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:17,462
I was like,
"I'll just grow it tenfold. For my son."

800
00:54:17,545 --> 00:54:22,425
That's what I was telling myself
while flipping one card after another.

801
00:54:24,135 --> 00:54:25,929
Fuck you.

802
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:39,442
Does it hurt?

803
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:42,904
You see,

804
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:48,451
I just gave you a chance to apologize,
but you put on an act instead.

805
00:54:48,535 --> 00:54:52,580
As they say,
"Sincerity always reaches the heart."

806
00:54:57,294 --> 00:54:59,337
Hey, you orphan bastard!

807
00:55:02,424 --> 00:55:05,218
I didn't just take your money for nothing.

808
00:55:07,262 --> 00:55:08,388
Ungrateful brat.

809
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:10,640
I made you happy for two days.

810
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:13,601
Goddammit.

811
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:17,355
I let you sleep at my place and fed you.

812
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:21,067
And we had a blast at the market!

813
00:55:22,193 --> 00:55:23,403
Right?

814
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:26,990
Am I wrong? Think about it.

815
00:55:27,615 --> 00:55:32,996
Scum like you could never even dream
of having such fun with a father like me.

816
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:45,133
Damn it.

817
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,844
You scumbag!

818
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:50,597
You piece of shit!

819
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:53,933
Not even a dog would want you.
Father, my ass!

820
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:55,310
Damn it!

821
00:55:55,894 --> 00:56:00,190
No way could a crook like you
be Hae Jo's father!

822
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:03,902
Damn it! Dream on, you scumbag.

823
00:56:03,985 --> 00:56:05,737
And don't kid yourself.

824
00:56:06,279 --> 00:56:08,448
He was kind enough to hang out with you

825
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:12,494
because he felt bad for an old man
living all alone up in the mountains.

826
00:56:12,577 --> 00:56:15,622
You piece of... Damn it. Shit!

827
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:18,625
You idiot.

828
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:21,044
I told you not to hang out with crooks.

829
00:56:21,127 --> 00:56:24,005
Seriously. Hey, come on. Let's go.

830
00:56:24,506 --> 00:56:26,132
Lucky you!

831
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:30,344
So finally,

832
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:33,014
I guess you guys are a team.

833
00:56:35,308 --> 00:56:37,352
Hey, you like that.

834
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:40,647
When someone takes your side.

835
00:56:46,444 --> 00:56:47,904
Like a little kid.

836
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:57,539
Hae Jo!

837
00:57:10,051 --> 00:57:11,719
<i>I left the house at dawn</i>

838
00:57:11,803 --> 00:57:13,972
to treat my son for the first time!

839
00:57:14,055 --> 00:57:16,474
...with the fish I bought for my dear son?

840
00:57:16,558 --> 00:57:19,185
<i>You must've been through so much.</i>

841
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:20,812
And you've achieved so much.

842
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:26,151
Why did you say all those things?

843
00:57:28,194 --> 00:57:29,237
Why?

844
00:57:29,821 --> 00:57:31,114
Why did you say

845
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:33,867
you were willing to give me your arm?

846
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:34,950
Why exactly?

847
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:36,661
Why did you say that to me?

848
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:43,543
If you were planning this.

849
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:55,305
No, stop!

850
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:59,309
No, stop it. Don't do this! Please stop.

851
00:58:00,185 --> 00:58:02,353
Please stop. Please.

852
00:58:57,742 --> 00:58:58,742
It's not him.

853
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:06,084
That jerk isn't your father, is he?

854
00:59:09,796 --> 00:59:12,382
Couldn't you tell from his face?
Obviously not.

855
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:19,389
The suspense was worse
than the World Cup penalty shoot-out.

856
00:59:19,472 --> 00:59:21,015
Don't exaggerate.

857
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:24,727
Hey, we're good, then.

858
00:59:25,770 --> 00:59:27,981
Let's go and meet the next candidate.

859
00:59:31,025 --> 00:59:33,152
Oh, right.

860
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:35,280
Don't worry about money.

861
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:38,157
I guess I can predict the future,
just like you.

862
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:39,534
Last night,

863
00:59:39,617 --> 00:59:43,246
something told me
I should put some of your cash aside.

864
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:47,750
Jae-mi.

865
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:49,002
I did good, right?

866
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:50,920
You should go now.

867
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:52,921
Go where?

868
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:55,425
Back to where you belong.

869
00:59:57,343 --> 00:59:58,928
Go. It's not too late yet.

870
01:00:02,890 --> 01:00:03,890
What?

871
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:07,186
Why are you saying this now?

872
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:11,232
I don't know. It's just not fun anymore.

873
01:00:12,567 --> 01:00:14,694
I thought being with you would be fun.

874
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:15,820
But it isn't.

875
01:00:17,947 --> 01:00:19,073
Hey, let's face it.

876
01:00:19,157 --> 01:00:22,243
You never planned on
staying with me for long anyway.

877
01:00:24,662 --> 01:00:25,662
So...

878
01:00:28,541 --> 01:00:30,501
let's stop drifting around already.

879
01:00:43,931 --> 01:00:45,224
No!

880
01:00:53,232 --> 01:00:54,400
I don't want to.

881
01:00:56,402 --> 01:00:59,197
I'm done being the fool
who keeps falling for your lies.

882
01:00:59,697 --> 01:01:03,034
Just this morning,
you were bragging away, all excited.

883
01:01:03,618 --> 01:01:05,203
So, what? Are you gonna give up

884
01:01:05,286 --> 01:01:08,331
because the man playing daddy
stabbed you in the back?

885
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:12,418
Don't play the victim.
No more pity parties.

886
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:15,505
Be grateful that you have
a birth father to even look for.

887
01:01:15,588 --> 01:01:18,257
I'm the real fucking orphan here.

888
01:01:21,302 --> 01:01:25,223
You asked me to join you.
To wander around aimlessly.

889
01:01:25,306 --> 01:01:28,309
I said no, but you dragged me into this.

890
01:01:28,393 --> 01:01:30,770
And now,
you want me gone because I'm no fun?

891
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:31,896
Well, screw you!

892
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:38,736
I'm not leaving!

893
01:01:40,863 --> 01:01:43,449
I'm going to find your father and ask him

894
01:01:44,325 --> 01:01:46,244
why he had to bring

895
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:50,123
a mean jerk like you into the world.

896
01:01:51,374 --> 01:01:53,626
I will. I'll...

897
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:31,080
Is that...

898
01:02:38,045 --> 01:02:39,045
Jae...

899
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:43,301
Jae-mi?

900
01:02:45,970 --> 01:02:47,388
Wait, it is her.

901
01:02:50,892 --> 01:02:55,313
<i>You said you'd chase me
to the ends of the earth if I ran away.</i>

902
01:02:57,315 --> 01:03:00,526
<i>Can I hold you to that?</i>

903
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:03,028
<i>I'll be waiting.</i>

904
01:03:07,825 --> 01:03:09,786
She really did say that.

905
01:03:13,331 --> 01:03:15,041
She said that for sure.

906
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:11,574
