1
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,039
It's like...

2
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,560
you felt it.

3
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,080
what's wrong with the envoy

4
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,479
Is there anything wrong?

5
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,120
No.

6
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,840
It's the same as the one in the fish tank.

7
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,520
are like the goldfish in the fish tank.

8
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,700
squeeze on this narrow island

9
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,050
understand and help each other

10
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,160
to survive.

11
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,680
Translate Luo and you go to Tan Jiawan.

12
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,400
Bring Mr. Ye here.

13
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,200
I want to talk to him.

14
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,200
Find a clean room

15
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,960
and put some Chinese decorations in it.

16
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,079
I plan to discuss with him for a few more days

17
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:47,140
and discuss more historical issues.

18
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,320
Please stay here tonight.

19
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,800
Got it.

20
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,720
In the Tang Dynasty,

21
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,980
there was an interesting entertainment activity.

22
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,560
fly a kite.

23
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,120
You mean

24
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,880
The kite can be placed in the sky.

25
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,960
but the axis must be in my hands.

26
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,640
I see.

27
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,560
You mean...

28
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,040
to control this old man, Ye De,

29
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:20,880
the people on the island will have no leader.

30
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,200
The colonel has been under control.

31
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,360
After the base army withdrawal,

32
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,370
things that can't be controlled on the island

33
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,320
wouldn't have happened.

34
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,040
You've improved a lot.

35
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,400
Not at all.

36
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,730
It's the Commander's usual guidance.

37
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,250
Do you know why Kainan's

38
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:44,520
[why Kainan's aircraft base is still unstable?]

39
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,490
I don't know.

40
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,730
Let's start from the south.

41
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,800
We've been sweeping

42
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,880
in Hainan.

43
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,160
and cleared 200,000 Chinese.

44
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,360
But

45
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,040
one

46
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,000
less than 100 people.

47
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,800
These Communist Party are so scary.

48
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,760
In the past two years,

49
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,240
has calmed down.

50
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,940
It's all thanks to the commander.

51
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,320
Make a report as soon as possible.

52
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,800
and apply to the Tuo Minister.

53
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,280
50 Okinawa immigration.

54
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,360
I'm going to

55
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,920
completely.

56
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,339
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

57
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,290
Go ahead.

58
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:21,880
Okay.

59
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:22,840
Goodbye.

60
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,960
You must be Mr. Ye.

61
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,920
Who are you?

62
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,720
We are

63
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,520
We’re from Zhongshan anti-Japanese guerrilla team.

64
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,160
My surname is Zhong.

65
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,020
I'm the leader.

66
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:03,860
This one

67
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,160
Come on. Come on.

68
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:09,840
Sit.

69
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:10,840
OK.

70
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,370
Ranger team, right?

71
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,720
My cousin told me

72
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,040
about your guerrilla team.

73
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,080
Although your team is short,

74
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,580
but they are well trained.

75
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,480
They are all heroes.

76
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,520
One against ten.

77
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,650
a lot of beautiful guerrilla battles.

78
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:37,360
I

79
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,370
I admire you.

80
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,560
Mr. Ye,

81
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,240
You're too modest.

82
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,720
The old man

83
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,880
[outside the island.]

84
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,480
How many anti-Japanese heroes have you supported?

85
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,400
Everyone

86
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:49,960
admire you.

87
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,010
There's one thing I don't understand.

88
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,960
How did you get to the island?

89
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:58,880
This is...

90
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,320
Someone is on the island.

91
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,080
on the island.

92
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,320
In the afternoon,

93
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:06,140
when the police are gathering at Lotus Tong Bay,

94
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,160
we came in

95
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,360
from the Northwest Bay where they temporarily left.

96
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,600
What's your mission this time?

97
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,520
Mr. Ye.

98
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,560
We're here

99
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,760
to

100
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,120
the actual situation

101
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,400
after the devil retreated.

102
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,480
Get the explosives storage.

103
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,320
the exact location of the fuel warehouse.

104
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:25,360
Then bring the information back to the guerrilla team.

105
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,620
and make the next plan.

106
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,800
Master.

107
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,520
I saw the Japanese drive here.

108
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,920
What kind of car?

109
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,600
Sakamoto used to

110
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,600
used to ride.

111
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,010
Take you to the secret room.

112
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,720
Please hide.

113
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:45,920
OK.

114
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,200
Mr. Sakamoto.

115
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,480
Mr. Na.

116
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,730
What brings you here today?

117
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,520
Today?

118
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,560
Commander Fujita ordered me

119
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,400
to take Mr. Ye to the command center.

120
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,000
Mr. Ye.

121
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,130
Commander invites you to the command center for dinner.

122
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,520
Dinner?

123
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,320
What if I don't go?

124
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,480
Mr. Ye.

125
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,320
Commander means

126
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,680
no matter what,

127
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,120
I have to invite you.

128
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,840
Looks like

129
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,400
I have to go.

130
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,240
I can't hide anymore, right?

131
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,760
What is he saying?

132
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,280
Hold on.

133
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:53,880
Mr. Ye.

134
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,360
I thought there was nothing I couldn't get over.

135
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,080
In the end,

136
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,840
Commander likes history.

137
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,360
We have a common topic.

138
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:04,720
Okay.

139
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,360
I'll go.

140
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:08,880
But...

141
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,220
I have something to tell Grandma.

142
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,600
By the way,

143
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,200
I need to bring something to Commander.

144
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:16,880
Please wait.

145
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,540
Please have a seat.

146
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,180
Have a seat.

147
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,080
Have a seat.

148
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:24,520
Granny.

149
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,180
Have a seat.

150
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,000
Hold on.

151
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,120
Grandma.

152
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:55,760
Grandma.

153
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,260
How many years have you been here?

154
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,640
Since young,

155
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,120
I studied with you.

156
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,760
Then you went to America.

157
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:07,280
I got married too.

158
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,140
After you came back from America,

159
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,120
I came back home.

160
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:14,320
It's been over 30 years

161
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,600
for over 30 years.

162
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,200
Thirty years have passed so fast.

163
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,520
Look.

164
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:25,320
Half of my life

165
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,720
all of a sudden.

166
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,680
Master.

167
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,960
Why do you want to ask this?

168
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,160
When you get old,

169
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:36,360
I always like to recall the past.

170
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,240
But in the past,

171
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,560
said that before.

172
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:44,960
It's okay.

173
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,320
Just chatting.

174
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,320
Granny.

175
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,640
This box

176
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,240
I'll

177
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:57,880
for now.

178
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:01,520
This is...

179
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,280
I'm old.

180
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,040
My brain is not working either

181
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,480
I wanted to give it to Ying Er

182
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,280
to keep it for me.

183
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,480
But she's leaving with Takemichi soon.

184
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,520
What about you?

185
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,660
are the closest person

186
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,480
in this family.

187
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,480
So,

188
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,280
I'll give this box to you.

189
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,240
and you keep it for me.

190
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,880
In this box,

191
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,040
is all we have.

192
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,360
It's the land property.

193
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,520
The title deed.

194
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,360
Macau.

195
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,520
The real estate in Hong Kong.

196
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,200
title deed,

197
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:40,920
and America.

198
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:41,680
UK,

199
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,250
and 13 countries across the world.

200
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,720
in the world.

201
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,240
Master

202
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,280
Listen to me.

203
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:52,600
I wrote

204
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,000
I wrote four letters

205
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:55,680
to Ying Er

206
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,400
and her two brothers

207
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,720
and Xia’s uncle.

208
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,760
one day,

209
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,560
If I...

210
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,520
If I can't remember

211
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,520
where this box is,

212
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,240
I don't remember.

213
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,520
Give this box

214
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,240
to Xia’s uncle.

215
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,640
Master.

216
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,520
I'll give you

217
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,520
on the island.

218
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:22,840
You

219
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,080
stay in this house.

220
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:27,160
Just hang in there.

221
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:28,980
You have to believe

222
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,320
the Japanese

223
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,080
will leave one day.

224
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:35,800
Mother.

225
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,200
You're the only person I can trust.

226
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,800
Got it?

227
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,640
Master.

228
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,920
Get up

229
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,360
Get up

230
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,120
Don't cry.

231
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,200
Grandma.

232
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,600
I owe you too much

233
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,200
owed you too much.

234
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,680
Ying Er can't leave you since she was young.

235
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,020
She can't repay it in her life.

236
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,200
I'll pay you back in my next life.

237
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,120
Master.

238
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,080
All right.

239
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,280
At this age,

240
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,080
at this age.

241
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,560
Later,

242
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,000
after I go,

243
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,840
you should hurry up.

244
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:30,840
Bingyi.

245
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,280
Chongren and the others come here as soon as possible.

246
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,880
and meet the guerrilla team.

247
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,000
and save as many people

248
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,680
as many as you can.

249
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:38,960
Leave me alone.

250
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,080
Master.

251
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,040
Keep this box

252
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:49,000
Keep it well.

253
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,760
There's one for you too.

254
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,400
Translator Na.

255
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,400
Can we go now?

256
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,360
Okay.

257
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:22,400
I brought Mr. Ye here.

258
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,520
Sir.

259
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,360
I'm really sorry

260
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,000
I asked you to come so early.

261
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:52,920
Commander.

262
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:54,780
He invited me over and over again.

263
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,570
What do you want to talk to me about?

264
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,480
On this lonely island,

265
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,800
the only person

266
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,040
open my heart

267
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,560
and talk

268
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,360
is you.

269
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,400
Really?

270
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,720
Why are you flattering me?

271
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,120
We have similar experience.

272
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,640
Same experience.

273
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,280
I'm happy

274
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,080
to sit and talk with you.

275
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,360
If it's late,

276
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,960
don't be shy.

277
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,560
Just stay at my house.

278
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,570
Your house? Yes.

279
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,360
Have a seat.

280
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,200
To be honest,

281
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,320
you should have come to me earlier.

282
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,520
I sincerely apologize

283
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,859
for what happened to your son.

284
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,520
Mr. De.

285
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,520
You are the consul of the previous dynasty in America.

286
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,520
I also worked as an assistant in New York.

287
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,730
In terms of experience,

288
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,520
you are an old senior.

289
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,040
If you're late,

290
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,359
20 or 30 years.

291
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:32,680
We might be at the diplomat's banquet.

292
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:33,960
A party?

293
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,000
We met at the tea party.

294
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:37,640
Yes

295
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,560
Now two people with diplomatic experience

296
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:45,960
meet in my hometown.

297
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,040
But now,

298
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,920
you are an invader who occupies my hometown.

299
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:53,680
And I am

300
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,680
the people

301
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,040
the people.

302
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:58,680
Lord De.

303
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,720
War

304
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
is a part of human nature.

305
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,600
You're an old diplomat.

306
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,320
So...

307
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,800
you should know

308
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,960
Don't expect

309
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:13,880
the world

310
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,220
will be peaceful forever.

311
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,240
So,

312
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,760
you brought soldiers to invade my country.

313
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,800
About our country.

314
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,040
It's just different from other countries.

315
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,280
English called mother's land

316
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:33,280
German called father's land

317
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,040
China and Japan

318
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,960
It's called

319
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:40,220
the country of our ancestors.

320
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,160
A friend

321
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,880
who was a diplomat told me

322
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,760
Where is he?

323
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,520
is the motherland.

324
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,640
This is the most despicable theory

325
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,800
in my life.

326
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:08,520
Let's not talk about this.

327
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,120
The two countries of China and Japan

328
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,640
have the same face.

329
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,080
Use the same Chinese characters

330
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,720
Confucianism and Buddhism

331
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,040
common culture.

332
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,080
With these,

333
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:25,160
it's feasible

334
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,480
is feasible.

335
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,520
In my opinion,

336
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,480
it's impossible.

337
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,930
The difference between our two countries

338
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:36,120
is like

339
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,400
to reach the destination

340
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:39,320
to reach the destination.

341
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,260
It seems that some words are not opportunistic.

342
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,880
Good and evil are different.

343
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:00,760
Iced coal.

344
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,560
Different stove.

345
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,460
Do you understand?

346
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,760
I admire Kiku.

347
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,480
It's quiet and beautiful.

348
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,160
Ju...

349
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,000
It's the emblem of the Imperial Family.

350
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,960
But you also admire knives.

351
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,600
and ruthless.

352
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,280
Japanese!

353
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,040
The Symbol of samurai.

354
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,320
As expected.

355
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,520
You're an old diplomat.

356
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,760
You can see through a person.

357
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,000
Sakamoto.

358
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,200
Prepare some snacks.

359
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,680
I don't need translation to talk with Deok Bus.

360
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,000
Excuse me.

361
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,240
Prepare some snacks.

362
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,080
I'll stay outside.

363
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,480
Let's not talk about this.

364
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:13,840
The Japanese Navy

365
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,600
I don't want to occupy Sankanma for a long time.

366
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,080
I don't like being a soldier either.

367
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,480
I like history.

368
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,840
I like studying Japanese history.

369
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,560
Chinese history

370
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,880
I like oriental history.

371
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,800
I heard

372
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:40,640
the general is a historian of the Japanese Navy.

373
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,010
and also known as

374
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,560
an expert in Chinese history.

375
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,320
But I don't know

376
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:49,280
Have you studied the history

377
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,200
under your feet?

378
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,400
You studied it?

379
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,800
Sambu Island?

380
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,010
The history of this lonely island?

381
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,920
I'm all ears.

382
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,200
Okay.

383
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,760
I'll teach you a lesson today.

384
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,400
General.

385
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,370
The east of the sea outside your window

386
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,960
is a lonely island.

387
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,960
There's a cliff on your west.

388
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,680
Do you know the story here?

389
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,800
Private yuan.

390
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,360
In 1278,

391
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:42,680
In the Southern Song Dynasty, only nine years old

392
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,800
of NanSong Dynasty.

393
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,240
and his seven-year-old brother Zhao Zheng

394
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,280
with the royal family of Southern Song.

395
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,880
The last subject,

396
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,360
Family

397
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,920
came to the Pearl River

398
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,600
on several islands nearby.

399
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,520
Next year, Jing Yan.

400
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,680
Ding Du Cliff

401
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,380
He also conferred Wen Tianxiang as Duke Xin.

402
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,680
Lu Xiufu is the Prime Minister.

403
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,280
Zhang Shijie is the general.

404
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,920
You mean

405
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:20,160
no Chinese history after Southern Song?

406
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:21,800
One year later,

407
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,760
Yuan army has advanced rapidly.

408
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:26,560
Attack!

409
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,680
On the sea

410
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,000
Zhang Shijie died in battle.

411
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,860
and floating into the sea.

412
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,200
On land.

413
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,330
Wen Tianxiang was captured after his defeat.

414
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,120
He was sent back to the court.

415
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,880
When he crossed the island,

416
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,360
he wrote a poem.

417
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,720
This poem...

418
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:52,920
is a vow of death.

419
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,240
The 20th day after writing this poem.

420
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,720
This war

421
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,560
ended with a tragic defeat.

422
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:07,480
Lu Xiufu died in the sea

423
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,320
and jumped into the sea.

424
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,600
Song Dynasty was destroyed.

425
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,000
I know

426
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,400
about that history.

427
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,160
You don't know.

428
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,200
You have no idea

429
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,200
the people of Sanbu Island.

430
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,360
Our ancestors

431
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,240
came to this island

432
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,880
in 1278.

433
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,920
Since then,

434
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,800
our ancestors

435
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,360
face the soil to the sky

436
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,280
Farming fields, weaving cloth and fishing

437
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,050
and live a peaceful life

438
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,600
and peaceful life.

439
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,200
Until now,

440
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,680
Now you Japanese have come to this island

441
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,480
and created a massacre

442
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,520
in 36 villages.

443
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,880
and made a grave of thousands of people.

444
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,720
I can tell you, General.

445
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,840
the residents you killed

446
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,600
are not just my relatives and neighbors.

447
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,020
These people and families

448
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:17,400
are all descendants of the royal family of Southern Song.

449
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,360
664 years ago,

450
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,720
their ancestors came to this island.

451
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,200
They have put life and death aside.

452
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,130
People are not afraid of death.

453
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:29,240
why should we fear death?

454
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:33,520
Killing these people

455
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:35,520
because

456
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,680
the secret base of Airlines 6.

457
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,160
I’m sorry for that.

458
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,240
The army didn't get rid of him.

459
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,800
He's still alive.

460
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,160
Yes.

461
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:52,680
I'm alive.

462
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,400
That's why I want to tell you

463
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:56,680
Sambu Island.

464
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,260
It's not just an immigration island.

465
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,240
but also a Chinese.

466
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,640
In 36 villages,

467
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,160
when I was the consul of Mount Tan Xiang,

468
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,240
there were over 2,900

469
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:10,820
The rich people of Sankanma moved overseas.

470
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,720
They set up

471
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,580
in Tan Xiang Mountain in America.

472
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,080
in Australia.

473
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,020
They have a three-stove reunion.

474
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,400
They set up Anlan Hall in Hong Kong and Macau.

475
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,320
These immigrants

476
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,880
who live overseas.

477
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,740
When they found out

478
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,800
you and your soldiers

479
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:29,960
In their hometown,

480
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,800
in their hometown.

481
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,080
Do you know what they will do?

482
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,720
What are they doing?

483
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,560
They're raising funds.

484
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:40,880
to bribe the warrior.

485
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,600
Whether this war ends or not,

486
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,000
they will never give up.

487
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:49,600
is to bribe your soldiers and your heads.

488
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,720
So

489
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,200
you want to buy my head too?

490
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,970
The next day you created the massacre,

491
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,040
I wrote a letter

492
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,920
and send it abroad secretly.

493
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,280
I told my son

494
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,480
to put all his overseas assets

495
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,000
into this matter.

496
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,040
General.

497
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,720
You carved 44 soldiers

498
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:26,400
on the cliff.

499
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,200
There might be

500
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,600
my reward.

501
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:33,000
Before they buy my head,

502
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,600
I'll kill you first.

503
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:37,690
No hurry.

504
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:39,770
No hurry.

505
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:42,080
General.

506
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,920
Let me read

507
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:49,320
a poem left by our ancestors.

508
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,160
Let me show you.

509
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:50,600
Okay?

510
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,930
It's not too late for you to kill me.

511
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:13,600
After all the hardships,

512
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:19,920
The war falls around the stars

513
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:26,520
Mountains and rivers are shattered and the wind floats

514
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:34,080
I was born in the rain

515
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:43,000
The Bund Head said he was afraid

516
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:51,680
A small sigh of zero

517
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:59,000
Everyone has died since ancient times.

518
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:08,040
Keep the heart of the pill to shine on the sweat.

519
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:33,720
Remember.

520
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,160
Remember.

521
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,000
This is Sambu Island.

522
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,160
Remember this place.

523
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,560
These people.

524
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,160
Remember.

525
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,280
everyone here

526
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,520
are the descendants of Chinese.

527
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,080
Don't shoot.

528
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,920
There's no bullet in his gun.

529
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,740
There's no bullet in the diplomat's gun.

530
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:44,920
Dad.

531
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:48,040
This is for you.

532
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:51,440
It's prettier than the last one.

533
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:18,840
Old man.

534
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,200
Do you know this place?

535
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:20,640
Here.

536
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,680
And here?

537
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,520
This is the barracks.

538
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,240
We've never been in.

539
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,000
Yeah.

540
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,280
Then what do you know?

541
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,090
Interpreter Na.

542
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,450
Interpreter Na is here.

543
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:33,760
Hurry.

544
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:34,840
Interpreter Na is here.

545
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:35,200
Hurry.

546
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,600
Get into the secret room.

547
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:43,760
Granny.

548
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,520
Interpreter Luo.

549
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,890
Where is Master?

550
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,800
Yes. Where is Lord De?

551
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,000
Where's Mr. De?

552
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:57,720
Ye...

553
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,200
Something happened to Mr. Ye.

554
00:32:59,200 --> 00:32:59,960
What?

555
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,840
Something happened.

556
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,240
Why did he bring an old gun

557
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,680
with an old gun?

558
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,800
I knew something was wrong.

559
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,680
Before he left,

560
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,320
he said something strange.

561
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,680
and left a letter to you.

562
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:21,960
Mr. De.

563
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,880
Why are you doing this?

564
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,080
Granny.

565
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,080
Let's go. Let's go.

566
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:27,920
Calm down.

567
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:28,920
You just said

568
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,280
Mr. Ye wrote a letter to Miss Ye.

569
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:30,680
Right?

570
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,800
Their plane will take off soon.

571
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,520
Give me the letter.

572
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,480
I'll send it to her.

573
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,120
I want to do something for her.

574
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,000
Okay.

575
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,640
I’m leaving.

576
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,260
Translator Na.

577
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,920
You're also a Chinese, right?

578
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,960
Kid,

579
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,240
We trust you.

580
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:01,000
Come back right after sending the letter.

581
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,280
Let's do

582
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,280
that concerns the lives of the whole island.

583
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,200
Yes.

584
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,239
Okay.

585
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:29,730
Who is it?

586
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,120
I'm Interpreter Na.

587
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,179
Is Colonel Takeishi here?

588
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:35,520
He went out.

589
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,600
He'll be back soon.

590
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,000
What is it?

591
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,920
Don't open the door.

592
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:40,520
Hey.

593
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,120
Something happened.

594
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:43,840
Don't worry.

595
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,600
Take care of yourself.

596
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:48,260
If there's really something urgent,

597
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,679
don't be impulsive.

598
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,040
Ask Colonel Takemichi to help.

599
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,040
If there's nothing else,

600
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:56,770
I'm leaving.

601
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,280
What's wrong?

602
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:37,770
Who sent the letter?

603
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,280
Don't go.

604
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,020
Don't go anywhere.

605
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,220
Don't go anywhere.

606
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,320
Don't stop me.

607
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,060

608
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,880
Stay here.

609
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,940

610

611

612

613

614
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,520
My daughter.

615
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,720
When you read this letter,

616
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,960
my dad was already dead.

617
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,280
Farewell?

618
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,340
It's a conversation that every old man can't avoid.

619
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:07,760

620
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,100

621
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,280
I will protect my daughter.

622
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,200
Death will come.

623
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,460
I don't rely on anyone.

624
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,480
But people always

625
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,080
thinking about various ways.

626
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,940
to cross the destination of life.

627
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,120
And I have a choice.

628
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,040
Don't be sad.

629
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:32,000
I went to the place where your mom and Dragon Hero were.

630
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,250
And this is another beginning.

631
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,800
It's not the end

632
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:41,880
Remember our predecessors.

633
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,760
The Top Three of Song.

634
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,400

635
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:47,240
Fight southeast

636
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,760
and never return.

637
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:50,800
In the end,

638
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,200
he was defeated at the cliff.

639
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,320
and died for the country.

640
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,080
He sacrificed his life for justice.

641
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,920
especially for singing and crying.

642
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,320
How pathetic.

643
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,000
My predecessors

644
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,560
have witnessed

645
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,080
witnessed

646
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:09,940
the exchange of political power.

647
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,720

650
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,720
In our generation,

651
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,680
we have experienced exorcism,

652
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:25,560
I haven't seen the prosperity of China.

653
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,400
Under Mr. Sun's leadership,

654
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:32,760
a new country is rising

655
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:36,560
but it's also under a powerful gun.

656
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:37,960
under the powerful guns.

657
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,400
Even if we overthrow the monarchy,

658
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,320
the revolution failed.

659
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,280
A loyal and loyal man

660
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,120
and devoted my life.

661
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,360
After death.

662
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,560
The result is blunt.

663
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,040
is not reversed.

664
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,640
This is all for the glorious future.

668

has a long way to go.

669
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,760
The responsibility is

670
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,880
on your shoulders.

671
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,800

678
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,240

That way,
