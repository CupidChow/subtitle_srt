1
00:01:41,039 --> 00:01:44,080
The dead can't come back to life.

2
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,520
My condolences.

3
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,039
I am deeply condolenced.

4
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,280
Thank you for coming.

5
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:54,520
Sorry for neglecting you.

6
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,960
It's okay.

7
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,880
I understand how you feel.

8
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:05,680
No matter what,

9
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,800
no matter what.

10
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,120
My son

11
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,640
died a strange death.

12
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:14,040
The cause of death hasn't been found yet.

13
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,640
I’ll do whatever it takes

14
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,400
no matter what.

15
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,040
Revenge!

16
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,600
until we die.

17
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,400
Do you have any idea about the murderer?

18
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,520
Captain Oshima said

19
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:34,400
All the signs indicate that

20
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,840
the colonel of the Servant Room

21
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,000
and his lover.

22
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,920
But there's no conclusive evidence.

23
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,600
Don't worry, sir.

24
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,800
If Colonel

25
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,200
is really related to your son's death,

26
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,800
I won't let him go.

27
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,400
Thank you, Major General.

28
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,400
To break through Colonel,

29
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,760
we have to start with the woman next to him.

30
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,760
The Guktae ballroom she used to be at.

31
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,600
I've sent someone to keep an eye on her,

32
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,400
but we couldn't find any evidence.

33
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,160
If we enter the ballroom,

34
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,000
we might find evidence.

35
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,520
Mr. Inai.

36
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,000
Without evidence,

37
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,160
why don't you create some yourself?

38
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,360
You mean...

39
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,120
What did he say?

40
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,000
The secret between Colonel and his woman has been revealed.

41
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,720
Everything makes sense.

42
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,760
Americans landed.

43
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,720
Colonel came to this island

44
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,040
with a woman.

45
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,120
Since the truth is confirmed,

46
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,640
we still lack evidence.

47
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,000
Yes.

48
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,000
Sir.

49
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,640
Inupstairs Apartment called

50
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,560
to take action

51
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,160
tonight.

52
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,360
Looks like we're going to find a way out.

53
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:58,320
Rose. Rose is the most delicate.

54
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:04,320
Rose is the most beautiful.

55
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,360
Wine.

56
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,560
Turn left.

57
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,280
Ready.

58
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,560
Search!

59
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,520
Follow me.

60
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,400
Go!

61
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,120
Hurry up.

62
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:52,480
Japanese soldiers

63
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,240
What's wrong?

64
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,840
Japanese soldiers have surrounded us.

65
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,000
What?

66
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,760
Don't move.

67
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,480
Don't move.

68
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,680
Stop dancing.

69
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,840
What are you doing?

70
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,520
What are you doing?

71
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,080
What's going on?

72
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,600
Is there a misunderstanding?

73
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,520
Isn't this

74
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,920
Mr. Irigami from the Inashiki Apartment?

75
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,960
What brings you here?

76
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,720
We received information that

77
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,480
Two Imperial soldiers

78
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,000
were killed in Guktae Ballroom.

79
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,159
We need a thorough search.

80
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:45,680
Team 1.

81
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,120
Team Two.

82
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,040
Search.

83
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,520
You...

84
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,320
I think you must be mistaken.

85
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,240
There must be a misunderstanding.

86
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,040
We are doing business.

87
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,159
kill you Japanese soldiers?

88
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,840
Everyone who came to my ballroom

89
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,600
are my distinguished guests.

90
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,560
There must be a misunderstanding.

91
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,800
It's hard to say

92
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:16,360
It's hard to say.

93
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,280
This...

94
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:26,840
What's going on?

95
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,120
Don't scare me.

96
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,760
Guards!

97
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:52,760
Arrest them all!

98
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,040
Don't try to kill yourself.

99
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,920
Tell them not to move.

100
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,080
Who are you?

101
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,520
Let us out!

102
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,560
Tell them!

103
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:09,960
Tell them.

104
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,920
Don't move.

105
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,200
Back off.

106
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,080
You go first.

107
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,120
Run!

108
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,480
Go!

109
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,160
Go!

110
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,400
Go!

111
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,560
Back off!

112
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,240
Don't come over!

113
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,840
Don't come over!

114
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,840
Don't move!

115
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,280
Back off!

116
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,160
Back off.

117
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,640
Let them all step back.

118
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,840
Back off!

119
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,840
Go!

120
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,160
Go!

121
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,040
Rachel.

122
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,520
Get him alive!

123
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,040
April 17, 1942.

124
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,000
The contact point of Shanghai Guotai Ballroom

125
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,040
was destroyed.

126
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,680
Damn it!

127
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,400
Turn on the power!

128
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,040
Report the situation here.

129
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,360
Amazing.

130
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,680
This is my favorite scene.

131
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,480
Look at her.

132
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,240
What am I doing for a girl like her?

133
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,680
I want some popcorn.

134
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,440
Why not?

135
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,000
It's better to have some fried chicken.

136
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,280
Watching a movie makes me happy.

137
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,520
Great.

138
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,520
Stand up

139
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,520
Guys, sit down.

140
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,640
We're close to Japan.

141
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,080
Now get your plane ready.

142
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,520
Get personal belongings under the deck.

143
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,560
Yes, sir.

144
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,760
Stand up.

145
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,640
At ease.

146
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,760
Pilot.

147
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,560
Please take your equipment.

148
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,600
Look at this.

149
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,200
Famous saliva

150
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,320
makes us drool.

151
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,520
I don't like this.

152
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,160
Don't bring anything

153
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,680
to your plane.

154
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,480
If you were shot down and arrested,

155
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,600
the Japanese will trace the fleet

156
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,080
according to these items.

157
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,320
One more thing.

158
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,280
From the moment

159
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,680
from this ship,

160
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,320
This may be the last time

161
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,600
see Americans

162
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,280
or see our friends and family.

163
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,360
You already know

164
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,080
there is no combat plane.

165
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:05,800
We will push

166
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,480
beyond its limit.

167
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,600
God bless us

168
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,080
we won't encounter bad weather

169
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,120
or a zero-style fighter in Japan.

170
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:20,760
These are letters

171
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,920
to my son and wife.

172
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,960
I suggest you spend some time

173
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,760
to write something for your dearest ones.

174
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:41,520
Help yourselves.

175
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,320
Guys.

176
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,280
Come on.

177
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,880
Let's hurry up and write.

178
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,680
Dear parents,

179
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:14,480
I may never see you again tomorrow.

180
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:17,240
But don't be sad after reading this letter.

181
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,320
Lieutenant Colonel told us

182
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,280
the probability of everyone

183
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,400
to survive.

184
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,200
I volunteered to take part in this mission.

185
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,240
I'm proud.

186
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,960
I'm a soldier.

187
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,240
In the end, my life

188
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,600
to my country.

189
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,040
Don't wait for me.

190
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,720
I love your son.

191
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,360
Col.

192
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,960
Thank you, bro.

193
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,240
Do you have more moisturin?

194
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,160
If possible,

195
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,280
give me more.

196
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,520
Thank you.

197
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,920
Sir.

198
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:42,480
Come in.

199
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,240
Sir.

200
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,360
An urgent call from the Inupstairs Apartment.

201
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,040
The dance hall is the military stronghold.

202
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,960
Now the explosion has no survivor.

203
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,960
Reply to the Inashimi Apartment immediately.

204
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:55,840
First,

205
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,000
Thank you for your action.

206
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:58,840
Second,

207
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:00,760
I'll give him an explanation

208
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:03,520
I'll give him an explanation as soon as possible.

209
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,200
Yes.

210
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:13,080
Gather around to catch Ye Biying.

211
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,640
Captain Oshima.

212
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,680
What do you want from Colonel?

213
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,359
I’ll tell him.

214
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,400
It's you again.

215
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:20,319
You're not qualified.

216
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:21,760
Go away.

217
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,319
This won't do.

218
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:44,880
Don't fight!

219
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,240
Yes.

220
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,400
You too.

221
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:07,800
Stop it!

222
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,920
What are you doing?

223
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,520
Colonel.

224
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,200
I’m here to bring you good news.

225
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,760
Of course.

226
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,360
For your assistant,

227
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,280
may be a bad news.

228
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,320
From Shanghai.

229
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,960
in Shanghai.

230
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,760
has been confirmed.

231
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,960
as military stronghold.

232
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,800
And the garrison in Shanghai

233
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,600
and the manor on the well

234
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,880
has been destroyed.

235
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,080
My assistant works there.

236
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,160
So you think

237
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,800
she must be a commander?

238
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,120
Come to the team.

239
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,240
I have a way to make her confess.

240
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,200
Colonel.

241
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,160
Are you still trying to stop me?

242
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,360
Or Colonel?

243
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,800
I already knew who she was.

244
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,520
I have the highest authorization of Commander Fujita.

245
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,480
If anyone dares to touch my assistant,

246
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:36,800
I'll shoot him to death.

247
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,320
If you don't believe me,

248
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,520
you can call

249
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,280
to Commander Fujita.

250
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,880
Okay. Let's go together.

251
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,960
I'll report to you face to face.

252
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,280
If you have to,

253
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,600
you pushed everything on me

254
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,640
and get away.

255
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:31,480
Guys.

256
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:32,920
Let's go.

257
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,600
What's wrong?

258
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,120
You're making a fuss at this hour.

259
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,280
Oshima!

260
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,080
There's a limit to my patience.

261
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,520
I just received

262
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,200
about the well house in Shanghai.

263
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,040
This matter

264
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,160
is related to Miss Ye Bi Ying.

265
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,160
To put it simply,

266
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,040
Commander.

267
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,520
Captain Oshima Hao,

268
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,800
to get to the bottom of it.

269
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,280
I won't have such a chance again.

270
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:35,920
Tell me.

271
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,160
Shanghai Gutai Ballroom.

272
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,240
is the military stronghold.

273
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,160
has been destroyed

274
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:49,240
and the people in the well.

275
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:55,240
We found out that all the people inside have escaped.

276
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,400
Commander,

277
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,680
Please give the order to arrest Ye Biying.

278
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,320
and the identity of the colonel

279
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,000
and why he came to the island.

280
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,080
I need to report to you in private.

281
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,400
Miss Ye,

282
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,240
You can refute

283
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,560
to Oshima.

284
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,880
Colonel and I are both here.

285
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,760
This is an open and fair occasion.

286
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,520
Commander.

287
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,520
About Miss Ye's identity,

288
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,240
I knew it long ago.

289
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,520
Colonel.

290
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,240
You finally confessed.

291
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,080
Take down the colonel.

292
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,080
Yes.

293
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,640
Arrest the colonel!

294
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,960
Sasaki!

295
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,360
Are you crazy?

296
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,920
This is an order.

297
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,480
Akino!

298
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,520
Are you rebelling?

299
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,000
Shotgun Squadron!

300
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,760
I'll protect the colonel.

301
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,480
Commander.

302
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,120
Do you remember what I told you before?

303
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,000
in the Navy base,

304
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,720
The officer who was ordered?

305
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,320
Captain Akino.

306
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,280
I order you

307
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,320
to arrest the captain

308
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,600
Captain of Special Forces Brigade.

309
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,520
Okay. Okay.

310
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,360
Wait.

311
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,400
Get lost!

312
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,680
Sasaki!

313
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,600
What are you doing?

314
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,800
Stop it!

315
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,520
Find out where this is!

316
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,720
Akino.

317
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,000
Sasaki!

318
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,600
Take your men out.

319
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:03,520
Habha!

320
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,640
Just get lost.

321
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,800
Goodbye.

322
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,720
Get out.

323
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,400
Commander.

324
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,480
Don't talk.

325
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,520
Let's talk inside.

326
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:44,520
Commander.

327
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,000
Why don't you understand?

328
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,520
Shut up!

329
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,680
Captain Oshima!

330
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:50,960
Your crime...

331
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,600
I'll count them one by one later.

332
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:53,600
First,

333
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,960
I want you to figure out something first.

334
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,280
This is also

335
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,080
to Commander Fujita.

336
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,880
about my assistant Ye Bi-ying.

337
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,520
was suspected

338
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,520
by Captain Oshima.

339
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,720
Miss Ye Biying.

340
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,120
I did work

341
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,600
in a dance hall in Shanghai.

342
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,000
She's not just a dancer.

343
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:16,520
I believe Captain Oshima's investigation

344
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,200
who introduced Miss Ye Bi-ying

345
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,800
to me.

346
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:29,560
Tang Sheng Ming.

347
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:32,120
Mr. Tang Shengming of Wang Jingwei Government.

348
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,840
introduce me to a military commander?

349
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,200
He is famous.

350
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,960
Don't doubt him if you need him.

351
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,200
Wang Jing Wei.

352
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,560
Impossible.

353
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:45,480
This time,

354
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,160
how do you want me to prove to you?

355
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:47,960
I think

356
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,920
even if you call General Lotus swamp,

357
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:50,720
he won't answer you.

358
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,320
this stupid question.

359
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,120
If you still don't believe me,

360
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,600
you can go to Shanghai with me.

361
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,560
But I believe

362
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:57,800
Wang Jing Wei government

363
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:58,520
will ignore you.

364
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,600
You're just a cop.

365
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,520
Your foolish behavior with your friend

366
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,920
destroyed the communication point of the army.

367
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,560
At the same time,

368
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:06,040
you also pulled it out.

369
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,080
the one planted by Wang Jing Wei government

370
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,960
Ye Biying

371
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,160
of Ye Bi Ying.

372
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,600
This alone

373
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,120
you've committed a serious crime.

374
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:19,640
Interesting.

375
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,600
Of course.

376
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:23,200
Do you know why

377
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,040
when I ordered to arrest you,

378
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,360
didn't Commander Fujita stop you?

379
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,560
Because your true identity

380
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,240
your true identity.

381
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,360
So you took a risky move.

382
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,720
You want to use my assistant Miss Ye Bi-ying

383
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,720
to give me a fatal blow

384
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,680
and stopped me.

385
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,680
the investigation of General Daikoro.

386
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,680
Just like how you colluded with

387
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,120
in Shanghai.

388
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,480
and killed my important witness.

389
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,760
You wanted to kill me too.

390
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,520
Why do you think

391
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,400
kill you?

392
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:52,240
Because I know too much.

393
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,520
The second-class soldier has confessed to me.

394
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,240
Last afternoon on February 4,

395
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,320
he saw you

396
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,160
he saw you.

397
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,520
He secretly

398
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,200
into the air tank

399
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:06,960
in the aircraft tank.

400
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,360
Of course you can say I have no evidence.

401
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,280
Because the most important witness

402
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,320
was killed by you in Shanghai.

403
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,640
The dead will never speak.

404
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,360
This is also your plan.

405
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,520
But...

406
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,600
On the plane of General Daikoro,

407
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,720
During the daily maintenance of Sambu Island,

408
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,200
in order to complete your plan,

409
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,240
to complete your plan.

410
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,120
That's why there's a doubt.

411
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:30,960
That is...

412
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,520
Before I left the island,

413
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,600
I have confirmed to your subordinate, Captain Matsumoto.

414
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,000
Colonel.

415
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,400
You're so imaginative.

416
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,040
It's a waste not to write novels.

417
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:44,680
But...

418
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,040
The part of the Horn General

419
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,400
It's a bit hard.

420
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,120
After the plane crashed,

421
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,560
you were transferred to Shanghai without any signs.

422
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,000
Commander Fujita,

423
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,760
to think about the reason.

424
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,120
Can you figure it out?

425
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,520
I can't.

426
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,120
I'm afraid the real reason

427
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,360
only Captain Oshima

428
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:05,200
and his boss behind the scenes.

429
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,880
Oshima.

430
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:10,200
Colonel is giving you a chance.

431
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,040
Don't wake up

432
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,480
until you're abandoned.

433
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,800
He's talking nonsense.

434
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,520
Colonel Longji, Bridge.

435
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,320
Lieutenant of Military Commander Fumiya

436
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,720
Captain Oshima Hao

437
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,280
at the Academy.

438
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,240
What are you trying to say?

439
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:33,960
Two months before

440
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,960
two months before he came to China,

441
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,640
his driver and secretary

442
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,080
were killed in the car.

443
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,560
The police station in Tokyo

444
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,760
We've found out who put the bomb.

445
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,800
is Lieutenant Colonel Longji.

446
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,760
But when Tokyo Police Agency

447
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,920
was about to arrest him,

448
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,640
I suddenly got a call from Taego.

449
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,920
He ordered to stop everything.

450
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,360
to stop the investigation

451
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,920
and stop arresting the murderer.

452
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:55,880
It’s for the Commander of Military Order

453
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,640
of the Army Commander.

454
00:28:59,040 --> 00:28:59,680
But

455
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,000
it didn’t save his life.

456
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,760
In Air 6's base,

457
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,200
and Colonel Longji

458
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,080
with the bridge,

459
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,600
and kill for him,

460
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,680
is you, Captain Oshima.

461
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,280
You're a hidden killer.

462
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,520
It's time to reveal your true form.

463
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,360
Oshima!

464
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,840
You have nothing to say, right?

465
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,680
Bombing Tokyo!

466
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,360
What?!

467
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,840
Tokyo!

468
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,600
They came here

469
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,320
to deliver this information.

470
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:52,720
Private who was taken to Shanghai by him

471
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,600
is not real.

472
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,120
It's that American.

473
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,240
Where did you hear that?

474
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,320
From a friend.

475
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,680
What friend?

476
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,640
The Kewen in your mouth.

477
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:16,080
told me everything.

478
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,200
Captain Oshima Hao.

479
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,200
When can Kewen

480
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,960
can be a testimony.

481
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,360
Did you learn this in the Academy?

482
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,000
Commander.

483
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,040
Now the truth is out.

484
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,280
Commander.

485
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,200
I did discuss with Miss Ye Bi-ying

486
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,360
about bombing Tokyo.

487
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,920
But if I remember correctly,

488
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,720
I heard this news

489
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,720
from you.

490
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:45,800
That's right.

491
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:47,840
Colonel and I

492
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,680
once took revenge on

493
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,600
the Americans took revenge

494
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,400
about Jin-ju Port.

495
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,360
We discussed the possibility of them bombing Tokyo.

496
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,600
You suspect Colonel

497
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,840
just by these words?

498
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,520
Isn’t it too hasty?

499
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,880
Commander.

500
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,480
I've asked the IShang Apartment

501
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,320
to perform an autopsy on private.

502
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,960
The autopsy report will be out soon.

503
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,400
Commander.

504
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:10,640
This is evidence.

505
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,760
Commander!

506
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,160
Captain Oshima!

507
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,880
I just want a chance.

508
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,880
A chance to leak information.

509
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,800
Do you know

510
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:18,720
the person behind him

511
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,240
is far beyond the two of us.

512
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:20,960
If they know

513
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,080
we are the insider,

514
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,360
How dangerous will it bring us?

515
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,080
Please think twice, Commander.

516
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:49,600
Sakamoto.

517
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,720
Arrest Oshima!

518
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,160
Commander!

519
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,680
Are you out of your mind?

520
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,360
Hurry!

521
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,720
Tokyo will be blown up!

522
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,800
This is the information I got.

523
00:31:57,800 --> 00:31:58,480
Get out.

524
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,160
Please trust me.

525
00:31:59,160 --> 00:31:59,640
Stop yelling!

526
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:02,120
Tokyo will be blown up!

527
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,240
Commander!

528
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,360
Don't be fooled by him.

529
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,600
Commander.

530
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:28,960
Miss Ye.

531
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,840
Sorry for frightening you tonight.

532
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,840
I apologize for

533
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,520
I apologize.

534
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,800
Commander.

535
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,080
It's your duty too.

536
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,200
As long as the misunderstanding is resolved.

537
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,240
What about Kewen?

538
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,560
Wait for me in the car.

539
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,360
I'll talk to the commander.

540
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,680
Mr. Akino.

541
00:32:58,840 --> 00:32:59,400
Colonel.

542
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,600
Please send Miss Ye to the car for me.

543
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,360
My Lord.

544
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,600
The real murderer has been found.

545
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,040
I need to transfer him to Shanghai as soon as possible

546
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,960
and interrogate him there.

547
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,040
In this way,

548
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,080
we can minimize the influence on you.

549
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,040
to avoid

550
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,520
and Air 6’s base.

551
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,800
Colonel, you care about me.

552
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:41,920
Thank you.

553
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,680
Tell me if you need anything.

554
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,240
I need a plane.

555
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,760
The third co-airline team

556
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,800
has been removed.

557
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,560
From now on,

558
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,360
the 14th Airlines will remain.

559
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,160
After withdrawal,

560
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,800
All planes must stand by.

561
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,160
No flying without a mission.

562
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:05,560
You'll have to leave by boat this time.

563
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,680
Before I came to the island,

564
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,400
I visited the Shanghai Army Headquarters.

565
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:11,320
Chief of Anfu Tang Chuan once told me

566
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:13,080
I studied carefully

567
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:14,639
the Commander’s action plan.

568
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,760
The retreat route

569
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,520
is the most dangerous failure.

570
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,120
What should I do

571
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,159
what should I do?

572
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,840
There is indeed a

573
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,480
a postage plane flew to Tokyo.

574
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:34,679
and passed by Shanghai.

575
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:35,679
and install some emails

576
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:36,840
and fly to Tokyo.

577
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,960
It's just that

578
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,400
on this plane.

579
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:42,840
I have no problem.

580
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,600
I'll take the postage plane.

581
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:46,760
Are you sure?

582
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,880
Yes.

583
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:52,600
Okay.

584
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:53,840
I'll arrange it.

585
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,280
How many people are you going to leave?

586
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,200
But Colonel,

587
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,320
I hope you can keep me informed.

588
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,720
Take Daishima Hao with you and be careful.

589
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,680
He won't let this slide.

590
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,560
Don't worry, Commander.

591
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,520
I will inform you

592
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,680
to you.

593
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,960
But I hope

594
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,560
will never happen again.

595
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,840
happen again.

596
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,360
you can kill him.

597
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,760
One more thing.

598
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:24,680
What is it?

599
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,960
It's Kewen who was locked up by Oshima Hao.

600
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:45,800
Ichiro Takemuki.

601
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,040
We can't underestimate him.

602
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,320
If you leave,

603
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,000
our efforts will be in vain.

604
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:00,120
I'm the murderer he mentioned.

605
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,240
He must take me with him if he wants to leave.

606
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,560
You mean

607
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,160
he wants to frame me?

608
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,240
Fine.

609
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,960
I'll play a trick

610
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,120
to see how long he can fool me.

611
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,000
But Captain,

612
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,040
If anything happens to you,

613
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:23,080
Commander Fujita is a coward.

614
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,240
But it doesn't make sense at all.

615
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:26,760
By the way,

616
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,640
Sasaki.

617
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,800
I have to meet Commander Fujita alone.

618
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:33,320
Before

619
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,160
to me,

620
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,000
as soon as possible.

621
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,200
Okay.

622
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,200
I'll do my best.

623
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,600
Did you leak

624
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,920
about the Hokuza?

625
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,680
Did you leak it to Oshima-ho?

626
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,200
Yes.

627
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,360
You're just a big loophole.

628
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,120
You keep making troubles for me.

629
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,120
I'm sorry.

630
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,720
But...

631
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,320
I didn't know

632
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,200
will cause trouble to Colonel.

633
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,240
Tell Oshima Hao

634
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,400
Tell him to mind his own business.

635
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,640
Yes.

636
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:17,360
Don't just stand there.

637
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,520
Hurry up.

638
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,040
Will they let Kewen go?

639
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,040
Fujita is a cunning old fox.

640
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,240
to the police force.

641
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,640
What he said may not seem clear,

642
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,640
but I know what it means.

643
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:48,600
I don't want to care.

644
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,960
So if we want to save Kewen,

645
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,280
we have to let him go.

646
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:55,960
You have no right to order the police?

647
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,120
Do you remember Hui?

648
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,400
This is reality.

649
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,560
It's cruel.

650
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,320
But that's the rule of the game.

651
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:15,880
Then...

652
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,640
what will happen to Kewen?

653
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:20,920
You won't want to know.

654
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,320
Tell me.

655
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:24,080
I need to know the truth.

656
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,360
He will suffer the cruelest torture.

657
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,320
[and die slowly]

658
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,000
in the long pain.

659
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,040
It's too hard.

660
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,240
Not only physically,

661
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,720
but also mentally.

662
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,640
How is Ju now?

663
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:55,840
She's on night shift today.

664
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,120
No.

665
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,520
Ju.

666
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,320
I will marry you.

667
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,160
I've been waiting

668
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,400
for a lifetime.

669
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,920
Do people have signs before they die?

670
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,880
In another world,

671
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,760
Calling another person.

672
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,760
Will he hear us?

673
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,480
Right?

674
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,760
For Kewen,

675
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,080
can

676
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,560
leave without pain

677
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:27,040
is the best ending.

678
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,600
Yes.

679
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,400
This is the best result.

680
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:47,720
It's okay.

681
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:48,760
It's okay.

682
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:50,400
It's okay.

683
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,120
Kewen.

684
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,040
Kewen.

685
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:52,880
Look at me.

686
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,040
I'm Bi-ying.

687
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:54,600
Bik-ying.

688
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:56,640
It's okay.

689
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,560
You'll be fine.

690
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,120
It will be fine.

691

Captain.

692
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:13,680
I don’t think he’s useful.

693
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,400
I think so too.

694
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:21,200
But the captain doesn't want to let go of any possibility.

695
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,200
Ye Bi-ying can see her if she wants.

696
