1
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,400
It must be General Halsey

2
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,100
sending a welcome signal.

3
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,240
The door is open.

4
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:17,400
Sir.

5
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:17,880
Good news.

6
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,800
General Halsey is almost here.

7
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,880
Just 50 miles away.

8
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,040
Thank you.

9
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,000
Sir,

10
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,720
General Halsey has arrived.

11
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,180
Captain Mitchell.

12
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,520
This is truly a crazy plan.

13
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,320
Yes,

14
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,850
it's quite an unusual idea.

15
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,140
What a sight it will be.

16
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,040
No one has ever

17
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:05,040
put such massive heavy bombers

18
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,040
on our carriers for takeoff before.

19
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,730
Let's go see Doolittle.

20
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,360
Fall in!

21
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,240
Get up now!

22
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,160
Halsey's here.

23
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,520
Fall in, get up now!

24
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,400
Get up!

25
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,720
Bring your camera and follow me.

26
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,760
Put on your shoes.

27
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:50,730
Colonel.

28
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:53,440
Are they announcing the mission today?

29
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,800
That depends on our luck.

30
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,600
I thought this day would never come.

31
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,400
Attention!

32
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,400
At ease, gentlemen.

33
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,000
Don't get excited.

34
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,800
These medals

35
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,520
aren't for you.

36
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,079
This medal

37
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,399
was given by the Japanese

38
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:24,360
to our Secretary of the Navy Knox.

39
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,160
This one

40
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,320
was awarded to our

41
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,720
Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Fleet,

42
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,040
Admiral Nimitz.

43
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,760
Also courtesy of the Japanese, of course.

44
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,240
All these colorful things

45
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,370
are medals given to us by the Japanese.

46
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,640
Before we set sail,

47
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,159
all these old guys came begging me.

48
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:44,720
They said to me,

49
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,360
'Halsey,

50
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,200
we don't need this junk.'

51
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,600
Please ask our boys

52
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,320
to return them before departure.

53
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,360
So I'm here

54
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,080
to give these to you.

55
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,360
I want to say,

56
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,520
young men,

57
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,560
return these with interest,

58
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,120
all of them.

59
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:04,520
General,

60
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,480
are you saying we're bombing Tokyo,

61
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:05,840
sir?

62
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,960
I think there's no need to hide it anymore.

63
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,520
Our destination is Tokyo.

64
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,520
We will drop bombs on Tokyo,

65
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,480
Yokohama,

66
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,040
Osaka,

67
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,480
Kobe and Nagoya.

68
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,240
Yeah! Great!

69
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,240
Blow it up!

70
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,320
I can't wait!

71
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:32,320
Boys!

72
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,320
Task Force 16

73
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,320
including the aircraft carriers Hornet

74
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,360
Enterprise

75
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,770
and a fleet of destroyers and cruisers

76
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:46,920
will escort and transport Colonel Doolittle

77
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:50,000
and his squadron of 16 bombers

78
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,480
to waters near Japan.

79
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,520
This will allow them to strike directly at

80
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,080
the heart of the Japanese military empire:

81
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,800
Tokyo.

82
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:58,840
Men,

83
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,900
we're facing a difficult situation.

84
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,880
When the Hornet sailed from San Francisco,

85
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,640
General Marshall called

86
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,840
and insisted I tell you all

87
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,400
that we'll be flying to Japan alone.

88
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,820
Under normal circumstances,

89
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,080
our survival rate is less than 50%.

90
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,320
So,

91
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,640
even though you're all volunteers,

92
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,320
I'm asking one more time.

93
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,040
Anyone who doesn't want to continue

94
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,000
with this extremely dangerous mission...

95
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,480
This is your last chance.

96
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,000
Is there anyone?

97
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,880
It's okay if you have doubts.

98
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,400
We have 22 backup pilots,

99
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,360
and I'm sure some of them

100
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,760
would jump at the chance.

101
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,280
I'll give $100 to anyone

102
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:45,260
who wants to back out and let me take their place.

103
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,040
I'll give $120.

104
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,640
I'll give $120

105
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,520
plus a date with my sister.

106
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,520
You better have twin sisters

107
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,980
for me to even consider it.

108
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,659
Lieutenant Henry,

109
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,000
keep your $100

110
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,930
for the nightclubs back in Hawaii.

111
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,760
Attention!

112
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,080
At ease.

113
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,330
To wash away the shame of Pearl Harbor.

114
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,480
For our 2,000 naval brothers

115
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:58,360
who died at Pearl Harbor in 1941.

116
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,520
For world peace.

117
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,680
You should go home now.

118
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,160
Which plane will carry this bomb?

119
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,080
Sir,

120
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,410
it's my plane, number 7.

121
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,960
What's your name, son?

122
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,400
Lieutenant Ted Lawson.

123
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,520
Ted Lawson,

124
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,400
Sergeant.

125
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,520
Sir.

126
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,120
After the Tokyo raid is complete,

127
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,919
send a telegram to Admiral Nimitz.

128
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,960
Tell him the medal awarded by the Japanese

129
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,780
has been returned to Tokyo on April 19, 1942,

130
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,320
by Lieutenant Ted Lawson of the Army Air Forces

131
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,780
to those who presented it.

132
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Come here

133
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,060
Let's take a photo.

134
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,640
Three, two, one.

135
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,480
Smile!

136
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,610
Lieutenant Miller.

137
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:31,520
I am American.

138
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,640
Attention!

139
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,520
Attention!

140
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,480
Men,

141
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,360
our destination is Japan.

142
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,080
We will escort

143
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,400
Doolittle and his men

144
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,720
to bomb Tokyo.

145
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,880
This is the first time in history

146
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,460
that the Japanese Empire's homeland will be attacked.

147
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:05,560
Why did I bet on Alaska?

148
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:08,960
Who knows?

149
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,560
Damn it.

150
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,960
Our plan is

151
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:18,880
for General Halsey's carrier task force

152
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,080
to sail southwest

153
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,140
and deliver us to a point 400 nautical miles from Tokyo.

154
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,280
Our takeoff time is

155
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,560
around 6 p.m. on April 19.

156
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,240
After takeoff, we won't fly together.

157
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:32,880
Instead,

158
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,160
we'll spread out

159
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,400
within a 200-mile radius.

160
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:38,400
Initially,

161
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,600
we'll head west

162
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,640
but approach from the north

163
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,880
to avoid eastern Tokyo

164
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,000
where Japan's military bases are heavily concentrated.

165
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,680
We should reach Tokyo

166
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:50,920
around midnight.

167
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,120
After the raid,

168
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,960
we'll continue westward to China.

169
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,080
In the early morning of the 20th,

170
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,500
our planes will fly to China's east coast

171
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,960
and land at Quzhou Airport in China.

172
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,840
After resting and refueling there,

173
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,520
we'll continue on to Chongqing.

174
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,400
Our total flight time

175
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,160
will be approximately 11 hours,

176
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,160
covering about 2,200 miles.

177
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,080
Is that clear?

178
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:18,920
Yes, sir.

179
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,960
Thirteen planes will bomb Tokyo.

180
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,360
Three will bomb Yokohama.

181
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,000
The remaining three will bomb Nagoya,

182
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,400
Osaka and Kobe.

183
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,480
We will only target military facilities.

184
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,960
I want to emphasize

185
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:44,720
bombing civilian homes and the Imperial Palace is strictly forbidden.

186
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,400
Otherwise,

187
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,320
it will only provoke more brutal fighting from the Japanese forces.

188
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,160
Understood?

189
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,240
Yes, sir.

190
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:57,160
Sometimes your eyes can deceive you.

191
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,600
Learn with your heart.

192
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,960
I hope your Chinese improves.

193
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,760
I am American.

194
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,130
They're in trouble.

195
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,600
Let's begin.

196
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:20,640
I am American.

197
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,560
I need to go to Quzhou Airport in China.

198
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:32,920
I need to go to Quzhou Airport.

199
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:41,360
I am American.

200
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,280
I need to go to Quzhou Airport in China.

201
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:53,640
I need to go to Quzhou Airport.

202
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,520
Mark.

203
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,040
Take good care of these guys.

204
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:18,920
Yes, General.

205
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,480
Brothers!

206
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,160
Pull together!

207
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,320
Work as one!

208
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:38,560
For the resistance!

209
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,320
Brothers!

210
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,400
Let's get to work!

211
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,680
Let's get to work!

212
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,080
The big plane is about to land!

213
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,680
The big plane!

214
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,120
Brothers!

215
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,840
Pull together!

216
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,640
Work as one!

217
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,280
For the resistance!

218
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,880
For the resistance!

219
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,040
Brothers!

220
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,320
Let's get to work!

221
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,200
Let's get to work!

222
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,160
We'll drink when the plane lands!

223
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,760
Drink up!

224
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,240
Brothers!

225
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:09,960
Pull together!

226
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,520
Work as one!

227
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,320
For the war of resistance.

228
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,840
Brothers,

229
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,120
let's do it!

230
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,000
Let's do it!

231
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,960
We're about to land the big plane!

232
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,560
The big plane!

233
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,920
Brothers,

234
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:27,640
pull it up!

235
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,680
The planes are coming to bomb us!

236
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:32,520
The planes are coming, quick, quick, quick!

237
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,800
Run, brothers!

238
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,800
Run!

239
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,320
Following Chiang Kai-shek's secret orders,

240
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,400
Quzhou Airport has been working day and night

241
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,600
to extend the runway.

242
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,960
The small airfield that could only accommodate fighter planes

243
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,840
is being expanded into

244
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,400
one that can accommodate large bombers,

245
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,240
a medium to large airport.

246
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,800
The plane is gone.

247
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,720
Let's get back to work, brothers.

248
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,080
Come on.

249
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:04,800
Brothers, let's continue working.

250
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,320
Keep working.

251
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,160
Everyone come back and continue working.

252
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,520
Come on, back to work.

253
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,600
It's safe now. Continue working.

254
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,680
Come on, brothers, put your backs into it.

255
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,880
Everyone be careful.

256
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:30,920
Dad.

257
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,360
Mr. Ye.

258
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:05,480
Hurry.

259
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,080
Dad.

260
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,200
Ying.

261
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,480
You should go.

262
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,720
Leave with Wumu.

263
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,060
Don't come back again.

264
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,340
What will happen to you if I leave?

265
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,400
Silly child.

266
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:10,500
Fourth Aunt is still here.

267
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,720
Don't worry.

268
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,180
Once the mission is complete,

269
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:19,120
I'll come back to you right away,

270
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,000
until the war is over.

271
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,720
Is it worth it?

272
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,960
You stay here,

273
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,560
looking after Mom,

274
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,080
protecting this home,

275
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,980
and the entire Sanzao Island.

276
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,580
Isn't it all for your emotional attachment?

277
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,780
Have you asked yourself if it's worth it?

278
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,680
Brother is gone.

279
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,200
I won't leave you alone.

280
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:12,720
After the mission,

281
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,970
I'll come back to you immediately.

282
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,200
You're so much like your mother.

283
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,480
Because we love,

284
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,000
we put on armor.

285
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,680
Because we love,

286
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,450
we also have vulnerabilities.

287
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,060
That's what my mother used to say.

288
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,720
And she also made us

289
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,720
stronger

290
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,800
and braver.

291
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,680
Go with peace of mind.

292
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,680
Mr. Ye.

293
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:43,780
Director Shen.

294
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,730
Sorry I didn't come to meet you.

295
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,200
Lao Yi, bring some tea.

296
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,130
I'm practically treating your home as my office now.

297
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,520
Still worried about the sea mission?

298
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:58,560
Thank you.

299
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,240
They haven't

300
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,700
replied to my message yet.

301
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,520
I'm still anxious about it.

302
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,560
Don't worry.

303
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,960
After the Japanese plan was exposed,

304
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,320
the world's media has been watching them closely.

305
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:12,040
I bet they

306
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,880
won't dare to take further action.

307
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,280
Otherwise, they'll make headlines again.

308
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,290
They care about their reputation.

309
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:20,720
By the way,

310
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,920
what brings you here this time?

311
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,560
I need to trouble you

312
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,760
to deliver this letter

313
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,960
to Sanzao Island.

314
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,560
No problem.

315
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,240
Actually,

316
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,600
the island should have informed me

317
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,840
about the results of the sea mission.

318
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,200
But until now,

319
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,260
the carrier pigeon hasn't returned.

320
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,600
I'm worried

321
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,320
that something might have happened

322
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,050
to our communication channel.

323
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,290
That shouldn't be the case.

324
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,800
Sometimes no news is good news.

325
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,320
Don't worry too much.

326
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:57,960
Maybe.

327
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:31,240
Pigeon.

328
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,520
Sir,

329
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:49,840
look,

330
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,520
I can't handle this.

331
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,120
Did we receive a letter from Macau?

332
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:03,720
Ask Ying'er to come here.

333
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,560
Ying'er!

334
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,280
Father.

335
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,720
This is for Wumu.

336
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,040
Take it to him quickly.

337
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,560
Okay.

338
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:33,520
I'll go right now.

339
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,680
Be careful.

340
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,280
Wumu.

341
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:58,960
What is it?

342
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,160
What's wrong?

343
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,920
A letter came from Macau.

344
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:03,920
But...

345
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:04,760
I think...

346
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,200
Give it to me.

347
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,660
Don't move.

348
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,000
Freeze!

349
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,160
Stay where you are.

350
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:15,640
Stop.

351
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,660
Don't move.

352
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,880
It's too late.

353
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:24,880
Miss Ye.

354
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,480
Hello.

355
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,920
What's that in your hand?

356
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,090
Colonel,

357
00:27:34,520 --> 00:27:35,960
may I see it?

358
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,520
A love letter from Miss Ye.

359
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:50,760
What is it?

360
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:52,040
You want to see it?

361
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,200
Thank you.

362
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,600
Can he see it?

363
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,160
It's fine.

364
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,970
It's just a love letter.

365
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:25,010
When did you become so playful?

366
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,900
Not even a single word written for me.

367
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:29,640
If you have something to say to me,

368
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,680
just tell me directly.

369
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,520
Colonel,

370
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,400
I guess Miss Ye has

371
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,170
too many intimate thoughts for you

372
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,200
but was too shy to speak them,

373
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,480
so she used invisible ink instead.

374
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,480
Guards!

375
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,520
What did you want to tell me?

376
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,920
There's nothing here.

377
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,520
I'm leaving now.

378
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,320
Sorry for the intrusion.

379
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,400
Let's pack up.

380
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,090
Yes, sir.

381
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,140
The pigeon has been compromised.

382
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,320
I told you

383
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,520
not to take it out.

384
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,800
I kept telling you not to take it out.

385
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,400
Why did you still take it out?

386
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,880
You're getting more and more mischievous.

387
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:26,240
I was just about to tell you.

388
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,080
Let's talk inside.

389
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,180
How did you come up with this idea?

390
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:38,680
When I went out today,

391
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,960
I kept feeling like someone was following me.

392
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,280
When I saw them just now,

393
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,940
I naturally took the fake one.

394
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,880
This Oshima Hiroshi

395
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,450
not only dares to openly target me now,

396
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,120
but to expose my identity,

397
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:05,720
he specifically invited

398
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:08,120
a counter-espionage expert to the island.

399
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,410
So what should we do?

400
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:14,080
Someone has already taken care of it for me.

401
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:15,760
Colonel.

402
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,000
The General Affairs Section Chief from the Ministry of Colonial Affairs,

403
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,280
Mr. Yabei Jiro has just arrived on the island.

404
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,960
The Commander is hosting a reception dinner tonight

405
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,420
and invites you to attend.

406
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,130
Alright.

407
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,200
I understand.

408
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,720
Don't worry about it.

409
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,720
Are you the head of General Affairs

410
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,560
at the Colonial Ministry, Mr. Yagai Jiro?

411
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,480
Yes, I am.

412
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,160
Welcome.

413
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,600
I'm Sakamoto, adjutant to Commander Fujita.

414
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,120
I received notification from the Shanghai garrison

415
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,250
to come and meet you.

416
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,850
Thank you for your trouble.

417
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,960
This way, please.

418
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,040
Hello.

419
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,580
What's the situation?

420
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,960
Besides the full-body trauma,

421
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,280
there are multiple bone fractures.

422
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,240
Additionally, from the remains of internal organs,

423
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,720
we've analyzed the victim's lungs.

424
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,850
Has suffered from a severe infection.

425
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,600
Lung infection.

426
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,400
Any other suspicious findings?

427
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,200
And over here.

428
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:40,800
Eagles and stars... Could this witness be American?

429
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,820
Let's find somewhere to stay for a while.

430
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,139
You're missing your mother, aren't you?

431
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,600
In ancient Japanese,

432
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:50,280
spring is also called the season of cherry blossoms.

433
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,920
Every April, the cherry blossoms bloom.

434
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,960
This signifies that the cold winter

435
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,090
has finally passed.

436
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:02,520
I remember since I was a child,

437
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,930
every year at this time,

438
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,960
my mother would sit under the cherry trees

439
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:10,090
and brew cherry blossom wine herself.

440
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,570
This season is also a time for family reunion.

441
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,480
For my mother and me,

442
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:21,420
being by each other's side was enough to feel complete.

443
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,760
But today she will be all alone.

444
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,680
Hello.

445
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:41,520
One buckwheat noodle, please.

446
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,520
Sure.

447
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:44,600
Oh, right,

448
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,650
and the wine you mentioned.

449
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:55,920
Thank you.

450
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:09,600
In previous years, the blossoms lasted for 10 days.

451
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,080
If it rains now,

452
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,700
they'll only last for one more night.

453
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,020
The children fighting away from home

454
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,080
probably won't make it back in time

455
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,740
to see these cherry blossoms.

456
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,360
Do you have children living away from home?

457
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,520
Even if they can't come back to see the cherry blossoms,

458
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,480
they can at least

459
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,280
enjoy your cherry blossom sake.

460
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,520
Perhaps.

461
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,130
My mother often told me,

462
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,410
Cherry blossoms last only seven days,

463
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:53,050
brief yet magnificent.

464
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,280
Life is too precious to waste.

465
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,850
There will always be beautiful things

466
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,520
and wonderful people worth your devotion.

467
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,840
I'm willing to give everything for her.

468
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,880
I'm also willing to give everything

469
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,840
for my beliefs.

470
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,740
Now it seems impossible to have both.

471
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,450
The Major's death won't be in vain.

472
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:26,680
Telegraph 08596.

473
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,810
The secret he protected with his life -

474
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,200
we will successfully get it out.

475
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,360
Then you can notify

476
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:37,200
your family in Tokyo and your mother.

477
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,760
Don't torture me with hope anymore.

478
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,880
On April 1st,

479
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,960
the American forces will transport a bomber squadron

480
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,360
across the Pacific.

481
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,760
On April 18th,

482
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,610
they will reach the waters near Japan.

483
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,400
We must

484
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,800
before April 18th

485
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,880
reach Quzhou Airport in western Zhejiang.

486
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,000
On April 19th, we need to be there

487
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:06,130
to assist the landing of the squadron that bombed Tokyo.

488
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,600
You never told me

489
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,130
how we're going to retreat.

490
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,120
The evacuation plan from Military Intelligence

491
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,280
is a dead end.

492
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,320
Now I have

493
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,780
another evacuation plan.

494
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,520
But it's still risky at the moment.

495
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,780
What evacuation plan?

496
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:33,600
From the moment Major White sacrificed himself,

497
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,330
I've been working on this plan.

498
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:37,960
When White left,

499
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,200
his cover identity

500
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,000
was as a suspect and witness

501
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,060
in the Tsuneo Ōsumi plane crash case.

502
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,640
Now we need someone like that again.

503
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:48,770
Hiroshi Ōshima.

504
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,360
You definitely have what it takes

505
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,280
to be a good intelligence officer.

506
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,360
Bomb Tokyo.

507
00:38:59,160 --> 00:38:59,920
Bomb.

508
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,880
Let's begin.

509
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,160
This headquarters used to be called the German Residence.

510
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:22,120
It was built according to Chinese preferences

511
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,080
and customs.

512
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,920
Today, we'll follow Chinese customs.

513
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,640
Round table, square chairs,

514
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,370
sitting together for our meal.

515
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,600
Let's welcome the Director of General Affairs

516
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,060
from the Colonial Ministry, Mr. Yabei Jiro.

517
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,680
My name is Yabei Jiro.

518
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,920
Thank you, Commander

519
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,520
and everyone for your generous hospitality.

520
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,580
I'm truly honored.

521
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,160
Cheers.

522
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,520
Cheers.

523
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:52,540
Let me introduce you to

524
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,360
this gentleman from Sanzao Island,

525
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:57,220
Captain Oshima Hiroshi of the Special Police Unit.

526
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:58,600
Captain Oshima.

527
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,440
I've heard so much about you.

528
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,530
I'm Oshima. Please take care of me.

529
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,680
I assume your visit to the island

530
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,600
involves very important work.

531
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,120
I wish you success with your work

532
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,520
and hope you achieve significant results.

533
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:11,650
This is Colonel Takeki Ichiro,

534
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:15,320
a special investigator from the Emperor's Chamberlain Office.

535
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,360
Colonel Takeki.

536
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,280
My apologies.

537
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,200
Someone who serves by the Emperor's side

538
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,930
is indeed a man of distinction.

539
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,720
It's an honor to meet you.

540
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:27,680
Mr. Yagai.

541
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,240
The work of your Colonial Ministry

542
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,640
is also very impressive.

543
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,640
It concerns the entire Empire of Japan

544
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:34,560
and the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity strategy.

545
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,120
It determines

546
00:40:35,120 --> 00:40:37,080
the future development of the Empire of Japan

547
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,320
and its direction.

548
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,450
I salute you.

549
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:45,720
Let's start eating.

550
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:47,760
Let's dig in.

551
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,640
Please, don't be formal.

552
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,080
No matter what anyone says,

553
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:57,720
the Metropolitan Police shouldn't interfere

554
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,920
in matters concerning His Majesty the Emperor.

555
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,960
Forget my name and face.

556
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:05,960
Yabei.

557
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,360
Don't ask so many questions.

558
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,800
Yabei.

559
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,280
How many immigrants

560
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,410
are coming to Sanzao Island this time?

561
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:18,640
Takeki just asked

562
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,040
what I wanted to know too.

563
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:24,000
Mainly the families

564
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:30,000
of the 45 households from the last pioneer group.

565
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,610
Is this Director Suzuki's intention?

566
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,240
Yes.

567
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,490
That's rather strange.

568
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,480
Relocating the families...

569
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,760
Director Suzuki has always advocated

570
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:48,040
moving families from Okinawa to Taiwan.

571
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,280
Why are they being moved to Sanzao Island this time?

572
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,540
