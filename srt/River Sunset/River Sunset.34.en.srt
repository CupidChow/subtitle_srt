1
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,800
Thank you.

2
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,600
Thanks.

3
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,479
Bingchen.

4
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,479
Degong.

5
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,720
This marriage contract has finally returned to its rightful owner.

6
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,640
Degong.

7
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,420
That's wonderful.

8
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,120
For our children's marriage,

9
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,520
without a grand

10
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,400
wedding ceremony,

11
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,680
I'm truly sorry.

12
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,660
We'll definitely make it up another day.

13
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,400
Degong,

14
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,040
you're being too formal with me.

15
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,520
You saved my daughter's life today.

16
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,680
I, Tang Bingchen, am eternally grateful.

17
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,280
Good.

18
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,640
It's nothing.

19
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,360
Si Po,

20
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,880
prepare some new satin fabrics,

21
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,520
bedding,

22
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,730
and set up a proper bridal chamber.

23
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,650
Alright.

24
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,000
Well, Degong,

25
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,360
I'll head back now

26
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,560
to pack up Ju'er's belongings

27
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,880
and bring them over another day.

28
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,400
Good.

29
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,560
Take care.

30
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:50,480
Ju'er.

31
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,240
Just formally call me Dad.

32
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,320
Dad.

33
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:04,600
I never expected this bad situation would turn into something good.

34
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,400
Indeed.

35
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:06,500
Degong,

36
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,840
let Xia'er come with me.

37
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,560
Let's go, Xia'er.

38
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,090
Go ahead.

39
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,260
Take care, Uncle Tang.

40
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,240
All right.

41
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,240
What's going on?

42
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,040
Why did you come back?

43
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,640
The major is dead.

44
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,680
How could this be?

45
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,210
Why did you suddenly disappear this morning?

46
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,880
Last night,

47
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,760
Luo Zhiyong saw

48
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:58,680
Dajima Hao and his men

49
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,280
loading boxes of

50
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:02,880
explosives and gasoline onto the patrol boat.

51
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,240
I suspect the voyage was a massacre.

52
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,320
Let's talk inside.

53
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:18,610
So you rushed back here.

54
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,240
Have you already figured out

55
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,399
your next plan?

56
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,280
We'll still use

57
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,640
the Dajiao Censheng plane crash case

58
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,680
as our opportunity.

59
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,840
This is what Fujita is most afraid to touch.

60
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,520
The reason they released Tang Ju'er today

61
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,850
is also because of this.

62
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,480
Wumu.

63
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,200
Why are you back so soon?

64
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,860
Where's the Major?

65
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,300
Did you complete the mission?

66
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,130
The Major died in Shanghai.

67
00:04:56,159 --> 00:04:57,290
The mission failed.

68
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,940
Then why did you come back?

69
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,280
Today, under the pretext of escorting a witness,

70
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,320
I took the Major away from Sanzao Island.

71
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,250
But the mission wasn't completed.

72
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:26,480
I need to finish it.

73
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,800
I need to leave Sanzao Island again,

74
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,200
under the pretext of escorting a prisoner.

75
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,760
You mean Oshima Hiroshi?

76
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,120
Yes.

77
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,120
I need to take Oshima away from Sanzao Island,

78
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,080
and I also need to take you, Biying,

79
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,409
away from here with him.

80
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:43,159
But will Fujita really

81
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:43,760
let us go that easily?

82
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,880
I've already laid the groundwork

83
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,210
with Commander Fujita.

84
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:46,800
Fujita has already

85
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,240
begun to suspect Oshima.

86
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,120
The most important thing for Fujita

87
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,380
is to protect himself.

88
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,360
His position

89
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,200
means more than anything to him.

90
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,520
So sacrificing one or two subordinates

91
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,880
is not an issue for him.

92
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:57,920
Especially when it's such

93
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,920
a hot potato.

94
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,980
What I need to do

95
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,480
is convince Fujita

96
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,800
that Oshima is connected to Ogaku Mineo's plane crash

97
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,800
beyond any doubt.

98
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:05,730
This way,

99
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,280
I can naturally

100
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,600
use the pretext of escorting a prisoner

101
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,240
to take Oshima away from Sanzao Island

102
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,900
and remove a threat from here.

103
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,740
What I need to do now

104
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,880
is to find some

105
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,210
evidence that points directly to Oshima.

106
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:22,560
We could use the lifting of the maritime ban.

107
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,280
Director Shen mentioned before

108
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:24,960
that he hoped we could

109
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:27,120
use the lifting of the maritime ban to leave Sanzao Island.

110
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,650
But that's impossible now.

111
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,480
And the lifting of the maritime ban

112
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,520
itself is also problematic.

113
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:31,640
I also need to figure out

114
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,840
what kind of scheme Oshima is plotting.

115
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,480
I mentioned this matter

116
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,800
to Commander Fujita before.

117
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,400
His reaction was as if he'd just heard about it.

118
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,720
But Oshima organizing the lifting of the ban

119
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,040
without telling Fujita -

120
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,440
that doesn't make sense.

121
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,360
I think it's suspicious too.

122
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,280
So I suspect

123
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,810
Fujita knows about this

124
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,800
and has tacitly approved it,

125
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,200
but pretends not to know.

126
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,600
This kind of situation is very common in the military.

127
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,200
It means

128
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,159
a commander wants something done

129
00:06:58,159 --> 00:06:59,800
but doesn't want to take responsibility.

130
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,130
You guessed correctly.

131
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,760
Translator Luo once revealed

132
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,360
that Oshima submitted a plan

133
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,560
for lifting the maritime ban to Fujita.

134
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,520
But Fujita kept it

135
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,240
locked in his own safe.

136
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,490
So what exactly does Fujita want to do?

137
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,280
Fujita used to be a diplomat.

138
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,400
In his speech,

139
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,600
he often uses diplomatic language.

140
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,330
One sentence can have multiple meanings.

141
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,920
Though vague,

142
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,720
it conceals his own views.

143
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,120
Think carefully.

144
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,920
If the maritime ban

145
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:41,290
is a grand conspiracy with Fujita's tacit approval,

146
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,460
what does that suggest to you?

147
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,800
Fujita once told me,

148
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,800
'A drop of honey catches more flies

149
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,400
than a gallon of gall.'

150
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,520
'A drop of honey catches more flies

151
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,780
than a gallon of gall.'

152
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,800
He used to say this

153
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,400
to Oshima Hiroshi many times.

154
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,040
But Oshima

155
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,170
insisted on using gall to catch flies.

156
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,760
This saying was originally

157
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,480
from President Lincoln.

158
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,920
It refers to an appeasement policy.

159
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:16,240
Gall

160
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,780
refers to harsh measures.

161
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,160
So lifting the maritime ban

162
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,680
seems beneficial to villagers on the surface.

163
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,680
This is the honey.

164
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:25,880
But the honey contains gall inside.

165
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,840
Fujita went to Dahengqin Island today

166
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,160
and won't return until tomorrow.

167
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,080
So tonight,

168
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,980
I will do whatever it takes

169
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,039
to get the maritime ban lifting plan.

170
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:36,679
All right.

171
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,600
I'll go prepare.

172
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,360
Wait.

173
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,650
I'll go with you.

174
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,040
It's been four years.

175
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,160
The Japanese

176
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:55,200
choose this particular moment to lift the maritime ban.

177
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,200
And they've also registered

178
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:59,280
all the young men on the island.

179
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,360
If your guess is correct,

180
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,360
the bitterness of gall is already at our lips.

181
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,200
Mr. Ye, please remain calm.

182
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:15,000
Let's wait until I get accurate information,

183
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,860
then we can discuss our next move.

184
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:25,800
Dad,

185
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,260
we'll be going now.

186
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:28,520
Go ahead.

187
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,320
I know what I need to do.

188
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,620
You don't need to worry about convincing me.

189
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,960
I wasn't trying to convince you.

190
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,200
I know

191
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,800
lifting the maritime ban might be a conspiracy

192
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,210
that threatens the islanders' lives.

193
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,960
But

194
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,840
the most important thing right now

195
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,760
is to get this intelligence out.

196
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,400
This is too cruel for you.

197
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,240
I remember you said before

198
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,540
that you wanted to add some weight to my life.

199
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,500
I didn't understand then.

200
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,200
But I understand now.

201
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,680
Reality is far more brutal

202
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,600
than I ever imagined.

203
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,120
It's okay.

204
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,000
Thank you.

205
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,640
Don't mention it.

206
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:49,280
Did the major say anything before he died?

207
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,650
We didn't have time to say goodbye.

208
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,860
Inoue Akira's men surrounded us.

209
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,760
He pulled the self-destruct device

210
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,120
and died on the spot.

211
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,160
Next.

212
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,400
Do you know what kind of responsibility

213
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,600
we are carrying?

214
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,690
The Bible you asked me to memorize,

215
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,680
I've memorized it all.

216
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,800
That's just the master copy.

217
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,760
The Major told me

218
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,940
the decryption code on the plane.

219
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,560
What exactly is the mission?

220
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,920
The Major told me.

221
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,680
America will send

222
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,080
a bombing squadron of B-25 bombers

223
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,720
to raid Tokyo.

224
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,840
After the raid,

225
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,080
these planes

226
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,140
will land at Quzhou Airport in China.

227
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,480
The code the Major was carrying

228
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,480
The call signs and radio beacons

229
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,770
are meant to guide these aircraft.

230
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,400
If they cannot be delivered

231
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,520
before April 18th,

232
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,280
these planes won't be able to land safely

233
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,840
at Quzhou Airport.

234
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:46,820
Therefore,

235
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,320
what we need to do

236
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,840
is to leave Sanzao Island as soon as possible,

237
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,100
get to Quzhou Airport,

238
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,540
and welcome these returning heroes.

239
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,480
Sergeant.

240
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,240
Aren't you going to

241
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,880
tell us something?

242
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,280
Those Army pilots are tight-lipped.

243
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,680
Can't get anything out of them.

244
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,480
You know what?

245
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,640
Everyone on the ship is betting

246
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:21,840
on where these pilots are headed.

247
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,480
Some say Manila,

248
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:24,560
some say Midway,

249
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,780
and some say Japan.

250
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,280
I put my money on Japan.

251
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,080
But I also heard

252
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,520
it might be Alaska.

253
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,420
You want to bet on that?

254
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,120
You might make a fortune.

255
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,560
Alaska?

256
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:38,360
Obviously,

257
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,290
Lieutenant Miller is from Alaska.

258
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,720
There's a rumor that

259
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,480
the Army picked him for the Aleutians

260
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,360
for a secret mission.

261
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,000
All right.

262
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,120
I'll put 20 bucks on Alaska.

263
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:48,720
You got it.

264
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,000
Now get back to work.

265
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,080
Hey!

266
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:56,010
Not bad, Richie.

267
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,240
I heard they're going to bomb Japan.

268
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,040
Now we have to be

269
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:58,760
on their side.

270
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,280
Great.

271
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,000
Coming to Philadelphia,

272
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,060
I'm your buddy now.

273
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,050
I'll step away for a moment.

274
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,040
Cleaner!

275
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:12,880
Do you have any water

276
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,200
so I can wash my plane?

277
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,560
Here you go.

278
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,170
What?

279
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,250
You're welcome.

280
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:20,900
What's wrong with you?

281
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,280
Fresh water on the ship is limited.

282
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:28,720
If you newcomers don't like it,

283
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:29,640
here,

284
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,100
go get seawater yourself.

285
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,360
Here's some soap for you.

286
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,520
Come on!

287
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,520
You don't even know what you're doing,

288
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,180
Army pilot!

289
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:45,400
Come on!

290
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:48,960
Come on!

291
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,600
We need to break them up.

292
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,040
Guys,

293
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,480
stop it!

294
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,120
Stop!

295
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,200
Stop!

296
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,530
If you want to fight,

297
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,240
go fight the Japanese!

298
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,490
Remember we're in the same trench.

299
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,200
Go clean up now.

300
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,280
For your size,

301
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,810
that's a pretty good punch.

302
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:23,760
I was going to

303
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,640
let you try my left hook,

304
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,040
but your fist came first.

305
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,720
It's hard to throw you down.

306
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,240
Right?

307
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,680
You're pretty good for a big guy.

308
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:45,520
Do you know?

309
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,560
There's a lot of talk on the ship.

310
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,890
Everyone is trying to guess your mission.

311
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,040
I've heard some rumors.

312
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:53,760
I wanted to ask you

313
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,320
if you could give a hint

314
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,580
about your itinerary.

315
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,200
What kind of hint?

316
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,920
We have a song

317
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,160
that we sometimes play on the ship.

318
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,619
It's very good for morale.

319
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,119
You'll understand once you listen.

320
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,520
It won't involve

321
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,599
my specific combat mission?

322
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,079
No.

323
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,540
You don't know how important this is to them.

324
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,560
I believe you.

325
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,220
Lieutenant Mason.

326
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,520
Play the music.

327
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:21,839
It's the captain

328
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,680
ordering all ships.

329
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,560
Play the Pacific Fleet's Song of Revenge.

330
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,839
Baixue

331
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:28,880
Raise your hand

332
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,720
if you've already mastered

333
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,000
how to identify your heading

334
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,600
by observing the stars.

335
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,640
Ancient Polynesians

336
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,600
used stars and constellations

337
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,600
to guide them

338
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,080
across the Pacific.

339
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,240
First, I'll teach you all

340
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,760
how to use a sextant.

341
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,170
A sextant is used to measure

342
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,600
the distance between stars and the horizon.

343
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,120
Thank you.

344
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,160
You've all guessed correctly.

345
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,690
You're going to bomb Japan.

346
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,720
Did you hear that?

347
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:49,840
Give me the money.

348
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,000
It's Japan.

349
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,320
I was right.

350
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,480
That doesn't prove anything.

351
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,720
It's just a song.

352
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,360
Did you all hear that?

353
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,120
I was right.

354
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,880
These young men

355
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,480
are going to bomb Japan.

356
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,680
I told you I was right.

357
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,080
Take the turkey out of the fridge

358
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,520
to show them our appreciation.

359
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,520
[Heavy Cruiser]

360
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,840
Thanks to our Army brothers!

361
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,840
[Destroyer]

362
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,840
Avenge our brothers who died at Pearl Harbor!

363
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,320
[Light Cruiser]

364
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,680
Long live our Army Air Force brothers!

365
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,160
It's me, Inoue.

366
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,720
It's me.

367
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,840
General Tangchuan,

368
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,040
I've been waiting for your message.

369
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,120
Inoue,

370
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:03,240
that matter has been taken care of.

371
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,720
The investigator from the Sixth Division

372
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,380
of the Metropolitan Police Department, Yabei,

373
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,890
will arrive in Shanghai

374
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,200
by transport plane

375
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,520
tonight.

376
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,560
Let's have dinner together tonight.

377
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,080
Yes.

378
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,360
Thank you.

379
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,000
Where?

380
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,800
At your place.

381
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:29,120
How about Inoue Mansion?

382
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,080
I understand.

383
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,280
I'll wait for you tonight.

384
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,320
I've already sent out the notice

385
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,520
to send cars to pick up the guests tonight.

386
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,320
Thank you for your help.

387
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:45,520
I'll arrange it then.

388
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,200
See you later.

389
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,860
Section Chief.

390
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,500
Section Chief.

391
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,320
The section chief hasn't arrived yet

392
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,520
Please wait a moment.

393
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,090
I'll wait a bit longer then.

394
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:19,720
Can I help you?

395
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,880
This is a phone record.

396
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,760
General Tangchuan Anfu needs the Section Chief

397
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,360
to send someone to the airport tonight

398
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,020
to pick up a guest from the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department.

399
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:31,650
Alright.

400
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,360
Just leave it here.

401
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,560
When the Section Chief comes,

402
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,020
I'll take it to him for you.

403
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:40,720
Okay then.

404
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,680
Don't forget.

405
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,410
Don't worry.

406
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,720
Per request of the Naval Sixth Air Base,

407
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,960
the Special Police Squad,

408
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,120
and the Shanghai Inoue Residence,

409
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,400
Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department's

410
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,960
Special Investigator Yabai Jiro from Section 6

411
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,160
will board a transport aircraft

412
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:11,360
and arrive at Shanghai Airport around 7 PM tonight.

413
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,560
Connect me to the Investigation Division.

414
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,960
Certainly, please hold.

415
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,880
The Division Chief is already here.

416
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,080
You should come over.

417
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,210
Alright.

418
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,160
The Chief is here.

419
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,360
I've been thinking,

420
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,290
you should deliver it personally.

421
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,800
If the Chief asks later

422
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,000
about the specifics,

423
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,860
I honestly know nothing about it.

424
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:19,890
That's true.

425
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,650
Thank you for your help.

426
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:27,360
Chief,

427
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,660
please come in.

428
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,600
Connect me to the Investigation Division of South Manchuria Company,

429
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,930
ask for Chief Akanishi.

430
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,860
Take a look at this.

431
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,240
The Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department,

432
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,920
Section Six has sent an investigator here.

433
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,850
They plan to send him from Shanghai to Sanzao Island.

434
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,160
Really?

435
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,240
I've already checked this person's background.

436
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,080
His name is Yabei Jiro.

437
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,640
He's from Tokyo Metropolitan Police,

438
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,480
Section Six, a counterespionage expert.

439
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,410
Known as the nemesis of spies and undercover agents.

440
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,120
Chixi.

441
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,920
Do you think we need

442
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,520
to report this intelligence

443
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,580
to the Shanghai Party organization?

444
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,760
Wait a moment.

445
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,320
When is Yabei coming?

446
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,640
Today at 7 p.m.

447
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:50,240
But I secretly changed the pickup time.

448
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,200
We now have

449
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,760
two hours to deal with this.

450
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,880
This matter needs to be

451
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:59,210
reported to the Shanghai Party organization immediately.

452
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:16,680
Sir,

453
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,360
Takizawa from the Shanghai garrison intelligence division

454
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,840
intercepted intelligence.

455
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,000
The Tokyo Metropolitan Police

456
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,120
is sending a counter-espionage expert

457
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,840
to the 6th Aviation Base on Sanzao Island.

458
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,580
Wumu is in serious danger now.

459
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:32,960
How much time do we have?

460
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,560
Two hours.

461
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:36,720
Stop him.

462
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,760
The Shanghai Party organization has instructed us

463
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,200
to intercept this person.

464
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,640
They've asked us to do everything possible

465
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,640
to neutralize the threat from Wu Mu.

466
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,240
Who will handle this matter?

467
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,720
The teacher will be coming tonight.

468
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,600
Excellent.

469
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,480
The Party organization's decision is

470
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,120
Tonight,

471
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:03,560
we'll deploy my South Manchuria Special Investigation Unit.

472
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,360
We need to develop a solid plan.

473
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,560
Are you the investigator

474
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:46,840
Yabei Jiro from Tokyo?

475
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,200
Yes, that's me.

476
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,200
I'm Hirakawa.

477
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,730
General Tangchuan Anfu sent me to pick you up.

478
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:53,960
Mr. Hirakawa,

479
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,220
sorry for the trouble.

480
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,200
You must be tired from your journey, Investigator.

481
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,200
This way, please.

482
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,880
Does General Tangchuan live here?

483
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:24,360
Yes.

484
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,040
This is.

485
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,080
Someone who appears

486
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:56,800
to love their profession

487
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:59,320
and does it exceptionally well.

488
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,540
Such a person should have some sense.

489
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,640
Why meddle in politics

490
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:07,640
and interfere with the Emperor's affairs?

491
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:19,320
What exactly do you want?

492
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,800
Your enthusiasm

493
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,120
has caused us a lot of trouble.

494
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,120
Get General Tangchuan Anfu out here.

495
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:29,760
Shut up.

496
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,600
He's just a Major General.

497
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,400
At the request of Shanghai garrison

498
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,960
and the Sixth Air Base

499
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,520
and Special Police Force,

500
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,680
Investigator Yabe Jiro has been dispatched

501
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,800
to the Sixth Air Base

502
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,640
to conduct his investigation.

503
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:20,160
All departments are requested to provide assistance.

504
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,020
Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, Section 6.

505
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,280
Understood.

506
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:52,120
Sir,

507
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,650
I'm done with my questions.

508
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,420
Mr. Yabei Jiro.

509
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,220
You need to explain your mission here

510
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,000
clearly.

511
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,000
What's your purpose?

512
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,520
Never mind who we are.

513
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,860
I'm asking about your objective now.

514
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,240
However,

515
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,520
let me make something clear first.

516
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,000
We've already uncovered

517
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,260
everything about you.

518
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,600
Investigator Yabei Jiro.

519
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,600
From Kyushu.

520
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:25,120
Counter-espionage expert from

521
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,480
the Sixth Division of Tokyo Metropolitan Police.

522
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,320
The nemesis of undercover spies.

523
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,240
You're well-informed.

524
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,240
We need to verify your mission.

525
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,040
Remember,

526
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,840
if you say one wrong thing,

527
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,130
you know the consequences.

528
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,960
For this trip to Shanghai,

529
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,520
I'm just passing through.

530
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:56,810
I have no specific mission.

531
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:07,640
First of all,

532
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:10,040
it was Deputy Finance Inspector Tian Ronghe from the Ministry of Finance.

533
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:13,880
The request to the Sixth Division

534
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,160
was made by the police inspector

535
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,280
and Deputy Finance Minister Tanaka Sakigawa

536
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:21,680
to the Sixth Division.

537
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,970
Later, we also received

538
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:27,520
telegrams from Shanghai Garrison Command

539
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,240
and Inoue Mansion.

540
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,120
What about the special investigation?

541
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,240
There's a Colonel with palace credentials

542
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:40,520
who has a special identity

543
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:44,960
showing suspicious activities at the Sixth Air Base.

544
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,520
Is that so?

545
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,520
What suspicions?

546
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:54,600
This person claims to be investigating

547
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,520
General Daikaku's accident.

548
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,600
Seems to be engaged in some espionage activities.

549
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,720
I'm telling the complete truth.

550
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:16,280
You can verify with the Sixth Division of the Metropolitan Police Department.

551
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,740
The first stop is Shanghai

552
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,120
to meet with the Shanghai garrison's

553
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,850
Major General Tangchuan Anfu.

554
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,120
And Mr. Inoue Akira from the Inoue Mansion, right?

555
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,120
Yes.

556
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,280
Since Prime Minister Tojo took office,

557
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,580
you people from the Metropolitan Police

558
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,760
are certainly very active.

559
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,000
In today's Empire of Japan,

560
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,040
only you people from the Metropolitan Police Department

561
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,640
dare to defy His Majesty's orders.

562
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,640
Isn't that right?

563
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,420
Please don't misunderstand.

564
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,320
Our police department

565
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,360
has never participated in

566
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:53,520
the factional struggles between the military and the upper echelons.

567
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,320
Is that so?

568
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:00,960
What's the point of denying it now?

569
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,720
Akanishi Kokochi

570
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,520
Wumu's exposure is imminent.

571
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,760
This guy landing on Sanzao Island

572
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,520
will bring huge trouble to Wumu.

573
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,360
But from his expression,

574
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,600
you can't tell

575
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,240
any turmoil in Akanishi's mind.

576
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,120
Sir,

577
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,820
we only have two hours.

578
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,320
Stay calm.

579
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,180
Just ask me something.

580
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,120
Say something.

581
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,960
In this matter,

582
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:16,719
your Metropolitan Police Department

583
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,520
has really caused huge trouble.

584
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:19,580
No matter what,

585
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:23,900
you shouldn't interfere with His Majesty the Emperor's affairs.

586
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,360
His Majesty the Emperor.

587
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,199
A favored cabinet member of His Imperial Majesty,

588
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:34,760
General Osumi Tsugio,

589
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,120
In the jurisdiction of the Sixth Air Base

590
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,719
died mysteriously in a plane crash.

591
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,580
His Majesty was not satisfied

592
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,440
and sent an investigator

593
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:48,480
to look into this accident.

594
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,239
Then the Control Faction sent a telegram

595
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,159
requesting the Metropolitan Police Department to investigate

596
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,480
the Emperor's investigator.

597
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:58,720
Am I correct?

598
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:03,160
I don't know what you're really up to.

599
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,040
Are you saying

600
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:10,160
that the suspect at the Sixth Air Base

601
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,080
was personally sent by His Majesty?

602
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,200
What you shouldn't know

603
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,840
is better left unknown.

604
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,840
The Emperor intentionally bypassed Imperial Headquarters

605
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:23,360
and sent down an official.

606
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,360
Naturally, some

607
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,080
officers of the Control Faction would be uncomfortable.

608
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:31,960
As an investigator from the Metropolitan Police,

609
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,280
you've rashly come here without understanding the situation.

610
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,210
To verify this official's mission

611
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,480
and interfere with the investigation.

612
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,320
Is your Metropolitan Police Department

613
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,640
suspecting His Majesty the Emperor?

614
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:47,840
No, no, no.

615
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,160
The Tokyo Metropolitan Police received

616
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,680
repeated requests from the Ministry of Finance

617
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,280
and Shanghai Garrison

618
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,600
before sending me to Shanghai

619
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:58,800
to verify the identity

620
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,530
of that special investigator.

621
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:03,850
So you're saying

622
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,890
you're all from the Imperial Guard Division?

623
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,920
Don't ask too many questions.

624
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,920
Forget my name and face.

625
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:34,700
All you need to know is that

626
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,360
these people are involved in

627
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:42,720
activities serving the interests of imperial power.

628
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,040
I understand.

629
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:55,520
So what do you plan to do with me?

630
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,400
We've told you too much already.

631
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:01,890
To be honest.

632
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,120
Detaining you would be quite troublesome.

633
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,280
We're consulting with the palace.

634
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,520
Let's see what my superiors

635
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,720
decide to do with you.

636
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,700
Section Chief.

637
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,260
How should we handle this person?

638
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,680
Let's not execute him yet.

639
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:40,400
The Metropolitan Police Department has its difficulties too.

640
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,200
Let's consult with the palace again.

641
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:22,160
These are the Colonel's files.

642
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,520
What you're doing now

643
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,120
is nothing short of treason.

644
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:45,320
You've also betrayed the Emperor.

645
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,360
Your Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department's Sixth Division

646
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,960
has allowed itself

647
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,760
to be led

648
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,680
by military factions.

649
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:58,760
I truly don't understand the situation here.

650
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:03,040
You're really a troublemaker.

651
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,060
The palace wants us to give you

652
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,280
a chance to redeem yourself.

653
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:10,600
Three days.

654
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,000
Can you handle these matters?

655
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,480
I understand.

656
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,400
I'll do my best.

657
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:20,720
Good.

658
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,640
Can you guarantee it?

659
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,800
Please trust me.

660
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,120
When you're done, go straight back to Tokyo.

661
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,340
Did you hear me?

662
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,640
I understand.

663
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:57,520
What is this?

664
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,680
It states here

665
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,000
that you've committed

666
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:05,530
a capital offense by interfering with His Majesty the Emperor's investigation.

667
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,840
Sign here.

668
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,160
I can't sign this.

669
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,720
I believe I can execute you right now.

670
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,130
Can I trust what you're saying?

671
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,410
I'll tell you one last time.

672
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:20,020
His Majesty doesn't want any unrest in the army.

673
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,480
If you don't keep your mouth shut,

674
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:24,800
you're dead.

675
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,280
If you cause any unrest within the army,

676
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,520
you're also dead.

677
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,040
Understood.

678
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,200
Where do you want me to go?

679
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:54,400
The airport.

680
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,770
Someone will pick you up there.

681
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,320
Inspector.

682
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,770
I want you to remember this.

683
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,680
You've never seen us.

684
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,460
Never even seen any Imperial Guards.

685
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:12,480
Or any officers close to the Emperor.

686
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,680
Keep your mouth shut.

687
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:18,720
Our people will be watching you at all times.

688
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:23,840
Do you understand?

689
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:28,160
I understand.
