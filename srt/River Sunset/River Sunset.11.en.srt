1
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,840
What are you doing?

2
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:55,120
Wait a moment.

3
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,600
Excuse me.

4
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,800
Miss Ye is Major Wumu's assistant.

5
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,040
She's the commander's guest.

6
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,400
The commander specifically emphasized

7
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,930
that Miss Ye should make herself at home here.

8
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:34,340
This is Captain Qiuyechuan of the anti-aircraft artillery unit.

9
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,960
This is Investigator Wumu from headquarters.

10
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,560
While on the island, your unit will be under his command.

11
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,880
You must fully cooperate with the Major's investigation.

12
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,800
I'm honored to assist with the Major's investigation.

13
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:50,760
Please take care of me.

14
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,920
Pleased to meet you.

15
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,840
This is my assistant,

16
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,120
Miss Ye Biying.

17
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:04,850
Nice to meet you all.

18
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,959
Fadihai.

19
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,360
Sanzao Island Special Police Squad.

20
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,480
Captain Oshima Hiroshi

21
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,920
reporting back to you.

22
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,409
So Mr. Oshima has returned.

23
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,000
I just received word from Shanghai

24
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,200
about your transfer.

25
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,840
With so many distinguished guests on the island,

26
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,680
how could I be negligent?

27
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,080
I came back immediately.

28
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,320
That's right.

29
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,200
Colonel.

30
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,840
Nice to meet you.

31
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,240
I'm Oshima Hiroshi. Please guide me.

32
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,410
Pleased to meet you.

33
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,000
I heard my subordinates

34
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,520
have taken some inappropriate actions

35
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,480
disturbing you and your assistant,

36
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,600
even her family.

37
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,250
I apologize to you on their behalf.

38
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:21,850
I understand

39
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,760
that this is your duty,

40
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,880
but your methods were indeed inappropriate.

41
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,360
My deputy was put in confinement because of this.

42
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,960
I think your decision was absolutely correct.

43
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,080
Captain Inoue, in front of my assistant,

44
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,540
attempted to assault her childhood friend.

45
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,040
So I had no choice but to teach him a small lesson.

46
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,480
Please don't blame me, Captain Oshima.

47
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:45,290
I can't believe such a thing happened.

48
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,080
Inoue has become too arrogant.

49
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,940
Someone needed to teach him a lesson.

50
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,760
I apologize for Inoue's recklessness and rudeness

51
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,840
to both the Colonel and Miss Ye.

52
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,360
I wonder if I might have the honor

53
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,760
of meeting your assistant.

54
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:03,240
This is Miss Ye.

55
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:09,600
Miss Ye.

56
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,940
You truly live up to your name.

57
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,840
You don't look like a dancer at all.

58
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:19,920
I heard

59
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,940
you had a little conflict with our police force.

60
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,880
Just a small misunderstanding.

61
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,740
Please don't take it personally.

62
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:30,780
He says it's just a small misunderstanding.

63
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:31,840
I'm sorry.

64
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,220
I've offended you.

65
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,240
Please forgive me.

66
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,320
I wonder if I might have the honor

67
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,840
of asking Miss Ye for a dance?

68
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,720
I really don't feel like dancing today.

69
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,730
Don't want to dance?

70
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:04,960
That's truly a pity.

71
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,800
It's rare to see Captain Oshima in such good spirits.

72
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,000
You should do Captain Oshima the courtesy

73
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,520
of dancing with him.

74
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,920
Miss Ye seems quite unfamiliar with dancing.

75
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,960
Putting a phonograph here

76
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,020
makes it feel like a real dance party.

77
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:51,880
Why do I feel like I'm

78
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,720
dancing with a caveman?

79
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,080
Primitive people only dance

80
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,960
by banging on wood or basins.

81
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,640
We're much better than them.

82
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,320
Captain Oshima Hiroshi was not a good man,

83
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,840
but he was a very competent captain.

84
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,880
He was bold and arrogant,

85
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,520
cruel yet shrewd.

86
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,840
In his early years,

87
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,960
he participated in the Nomonhan Incident.

88
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,480
Before the Nomonhan Incident,

89
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,040
Oshima was ordered

90
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,570
to infiltrate Mongolia for reconnaissance.

91
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,740
They flew over Russian airspace.

92
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:35,000
Their plane malfunctioned

93
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,600
and made a forced landing on the vast grasslands of Mongolia.

94
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,080
The pilot was trembling with fear.

95
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,400
He ordered the pilot to fix the plane immediately.

96
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,280
Then he vanished into the night.

97
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,450
He actually captured a Soviet sentry.

98
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:50,440
And took him back to headquarters by plane.

99
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,000
Such courage.

100
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,530
The conditions here are terrible.

101
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,820
When I was in Shanghai,

102
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,840
I often went to your Cathay Ballroom.

103
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,600
The chubby madam there,

104
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,880
she always introduced me

105
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,800
to the star performer called Honghong.

106
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,320
She was a great dancer

107
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,560
and had a beautiful voice.

108
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,480
As I recall,

109
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,120
the madam at our ballroom was quite thin

110
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,770
with the surname Li.

111
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,240
And our star performer

112
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,970
wasn't called Honghong at all,

113
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,520
but Fanny.

114
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:29,240
She not only sang beautifully,

115
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,840
but danced wonderfully too.

116
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,240
As for this Honghong you mentioned,

117
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,640
or the chubby madam,

118
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:37,940
I don't recognize any of them.

119
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,960
In recent years, this man's footprints

120
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,400
have been found

121
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,660
on every battlefield.

122
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,880
Later he became a military policeman.

123
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,020
He enjoys killing civilians,

124
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,760
prisoners of war, and even Imperial soldiers.

125
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,040
Mr. Oshima doesn't smoke or drink,

126
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,770
nor does he visit prostitutes.

127
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,080
A year ago,

128
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,770
he was transferred to Shanghai

129
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,920
as the Special Police Captain.

130
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,600
The Shanghai garrison commander

131
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:07,680
didn't take Mr. Oshima seriously.

132
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,600
Later, the commander paid

133
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:13,480
a heavy price for this attitude.

134
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,600
These naval officers and soldiers,

135
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,960
after spending long periods at sea,

136
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,680
would look for outlets as soon as they came ashore.

137
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,210
Cases of prostitution and rape were rampant.

138
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,600
The detention cells of the Special Police

139
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,330
were filled with these disciplinary offenders.

140
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,960
Oshima Hiroshi wouldn't even give face to the commander.

141
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,360
He arrested more and more people.

142
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:46,800
What's more infuriating is that soon after,

143
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,520
Mr. Oshima caught

144
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,560
the commander's trusted financial officer, Major Sugihara Kiyoshi,

145
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,220
with evidence of corruption.

146
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,290
He drove Major Sugihara to shoot himself.

147
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,000
To get rid of this troublemaker,

148
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,360
the Shanghai commander racked his brains

149
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,960
trying to push him back to me.

150
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,920
In the end, I had to offer

151
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,760
two torpedo boats as a condition.

152
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,280
Recently,

153
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:13,010
he finally moved this 'Buddha' to Sanzao Island.

154
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:18,480
Listening to Fujita's casual introduction,

155
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,880
Takeki knew well

156
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:20,880
that this man

157
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,880
was a battle-hardened,

158
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:25,560
cunning and vicious old wolf.

159
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,920
He had already sunk his claws deep into

160
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,040
the soil of Sanzao Island.

161
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,480
He quietly reminded himself

162
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,760
that he had met a worthy opponent.

163
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,600
Mr. Oshima Hiroshi,

164
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:47,200
why are your hands moving faster than your heart?

165
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,680
Pardon me.

166
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,840
Miss Ye's beauty

167
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,080
is hard to resist.

168
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,280
No wonder Colonel Takeki takes you everywhere.

169
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:06,920
Miss Ye,

170
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,160
you truly have a discerning eye.

171
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,160
Becoming the Colonel's lover,

172
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:14,760
this way,

173
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,040
no matter where you are,

174
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,080
you can enjoy the best privileges.

175
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,080
To me,

176
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,640
Takeki is just Takeki.

177
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,100
He's not some Colonel.

178
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,600
It's rare to think that way.

179
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,960
However,

180
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,480
your father, Mr. Ye De,

181
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,360
probably wouldn't think

182
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,420
that Takeki is just Takeki, would he?

183
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,840
This is my personal family matter

184
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,880
and doesn't require Captain Oshima

185
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,880
to worry about it.

186
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,260
Don't be so formal.

187
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,720
Our Commander Fujita

188
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,520
was once a diplomat in America.

189
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:52,560
That's why

190
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:56,680
this private party is so authentic.

191
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:57,680
Right?

192
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:00,800
By the way.

193
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,120
Have you ever met Americans?

194
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,560
Americans?

195
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,000
Captain may not know.

196
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,200
Miss Ye grew up in America.

197
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,370
So she knows mostly Americans.

198
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,840
But I'm curious.

199
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,660
Why are you asking her this question?

200
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,600
I'm sorry.

201
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:41,120
I'll take back my beautiful dance partner now.

202
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,040
You scared me.

203
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,800
Keep smiling.

204
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,600
He's deliberately testing you.

205
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,180
Don't give anything away.

206
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,890
I'm already trying my best to control myself.

207
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,440
Stop with the pointless regret.

208
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,600
My cover identity

209
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,810
still intimidates him for now.

210
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,480
But you need to promise me

211
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,570
that you won't make the same mistake tonight.

212
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:20,290
I'll try my best.

213
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,090
Looks like our special training has paid off.

214
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:24,520
At least when we dance,

215
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:27,370
we look much more natural than before.

216
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:34,520
I've heard that

217
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,320
the ladies at Shanghai Guotai Ballroom

218
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,050
are all talented singers and dancers.

219
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,280
Miss Ye,

220
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,240
why don't you sing a song for everyone?

221
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:43,700
Miss Ye,

222
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:45,580
please.

223
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,690
Would you sing for them?

224
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,600
Thank you.

225
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:53,960
What's wrong?

226
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:55,360
She's shy.

227
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:57,740
[Applause]

228
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:47,960
Is this a dream?

229
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:53,640
Floating in the tide.

230
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,200
Drifting down the river of oblivion.

231
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,320
Oh, is this a dream?

232
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:11,600
Mist swirls on the horizon.

233
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:19,920
Strange lights flicker in the sky.

234
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,520
No one seems to know where you're going.

235
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,560
What does this mean?

236
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:35,040
Oh, is this a dream?

237
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,360
Bright eyes

238
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:44,840
shining like fire.

239
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,640
[Salute].

240
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,819
Had a great time today.

241
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,400
Thank you everyone.

242
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,599
See you next time.

243
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:11,859
Fukuda.

244
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,920
Don't do anything bad.

245
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,720
I would never.

246
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:18,650
Let's go.

247
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,560
The moon is so full tonight.

248
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,400
Sasaki.

249
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,360
This person is definitely not a dancer.

250
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:33,280
Go back and send a telegram immediately.

251
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,560
Tell Inoue Nishocha.

252
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,410
Understood?

253
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,930
The weather is really nice.

254
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,400
Let me introduce you.

255
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:53,680
Captain Akiyokawa of the anti-aircraft artillery unit.

256
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:55,160
Commander Fujita has given orders.

257
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,620
From today on, he will fully support my work.

258
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:05,080
The anti-aircraft unit is at your service.

259
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:07,250
Tell me about

260
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,500
the daily life on this island.

261
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,640
Our unit's mission

262
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:26,640
is basically staring at the sky all day.

263
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,980
Once you're on Sanzao Island,

264
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,840
Apart from

265
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,200
some troublemakers coming from other islands,

266
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:43,080
this island is so peaceful

267
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:46,480
that you forget we're in times of war.

268
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,560
In that case,

269
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,700
you've never shot down any aircraft?

270
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,620
That's not entirely true.

271
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,160
Some time ago,

272
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,920
an American plane happened

273
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,520
to enter our airspace.

274
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,720
We shot it down immediately.

275
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,840
Oh, that's impressive.

276
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,680
You've actually shot down an American plane.

277
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:08,960
Yes.

278
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:14,720
And there were three Americans on board.

279
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,040
Because of this incident,

280
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,500
Tokyo headquarters sent us commendations.

281
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,400
But strangely enough,

282
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,200
the police unit says

283
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:29,920
there should have been a fourth American.

284
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:37,680
These guys are really eager for credit.

285
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:19,080
Let me summarize.

286
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,280
An American transport plane

287
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:25,720
was shot down by us while passing through Sanzao Island airspace.

288
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,720
Three of the four crew members died,

289
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,200
and one is missing.

290
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,800
We've confirmed one person is still alive

291
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,360
and it's highly likely

292
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,360
they've reached the island and are hiding.

293
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,600
At this very moment,

294
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,200
an envoy from the Imperial Palace suddenly arrived on the island.

295
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,480
He also brought along

296
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,210
a suspicious woman claiming to be his assistant.

297
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:48,170
And this woman is actually the daughter of Ye Degong.

298
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,930
Yes, you're absolutely right.

299
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:56,060
Shortly after this envoy arrived on the island,

300
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:59,520
a sentry from the airport guard disappeared.

301
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,380
Could this be related to the Colonel?

302
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,480
Without evidence,

303
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,700
everything is just suspicion, not conclusion.

304
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,480
Sasaki.

305
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,250
I have three questions for you.

306
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:14,320
First,

307
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,220
what was this American plane doing here?

308
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,280
Second,

309
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,960
why has this Colonel

310
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,800
come to the Sixth Air Base?

311
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,240
Third, what is this Chinese woman

312
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,640
doing here?

313
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,560
Can you answer these?

314
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,860
Forgive my incompetence,

315
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,960
we're still investigating.

316
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,200
No rush,

317
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,900
we still have time.

318
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,520
Perhaps these three questions

319
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,760
are actually one and the same.

320
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,640
You've had a long journey today,

321
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,640
you must be tired.

322
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,240
Please get some rest.

323
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:49,480
Alright.

324
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,520
You're mistaken, Sasaki.

325
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,640
I'm more alert now than ever.

326
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,360
This feeling is like discovering prey.

327
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,700
I absolutely will not let this go.

328
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,320
We must take preemptive action.

329
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,640
You're right, we need to strike first.

330
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,720
We have two breakthroughs:

331
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,920
first, the islanders' secret rooms,

332
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,080
second, that woman called Ye Biying.

333
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,840
Regarding the secret rooms,

334
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,760
Mr. Inoue has questioned Tang Bingchen from the Maintenance Association.

335
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,360
He said

336
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,240
each family built their secret rooms

337
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,370
using people from outside the island.

338
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,680
No household knows

339
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,720
where other families' secret rooms are located.

340
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,640
As for that woman,

341
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,680
should we request assistance from Shanghai for the investigation?

342
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:36,960
No.

343
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,520
Don't alert the intelligence department of the Shanghai garrison.

344
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:47,400
Please have the Inoue Residence conduct an indirect investigation.

345
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,920
Understood.

346
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,480
Bring Tang Bingchen to me again.

347
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,720
Yes, sir.

348
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,200
Captain, the documents are ready.

349
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,640
Captain.

350
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,000
Good job.

351
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,300
What do you think, Sasaki?

352
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:30,940
Captain Akino,

353
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,240
you should go back and rest.

354
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,700
I need to take Miss Ye home.

355
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,640
Then I'll take my leave.

356
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,000
Thanks for today.

357
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,560
I'm coming in.

358
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:07,540
Come in.

359
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:09,940
Tang Bingchen is here.

360
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,410
Long time no see, Chairman.

361
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,970
Captain Oshima,

362
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:25,880
you're back.

363
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,880
You all go out first.

364
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:29,880
Yes,

365
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,160
we'll leave now.

366
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,120
Chairman,

367
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,360
during my absence...

368
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,160
Have you been serving us properly?

369
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,210
Captain Daodao?

370
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,160
Well,

371
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,720
our maintenance committee

372
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,680
has always been loyal to the police force.

373
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,520
You can rest assured.

374
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:56,960
Chairman.

375
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,450
Please sit down.

376
00:24:59,600 --> 00:24:59,860
I...

377
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:01,960
I'd rather stand.

378
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,250
Sit down.

379
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,880
My neck hurts when I talk like this.

380
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,800
Just take a seat.

381
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,520
Alright.

382
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:20,760
I don't doubt

383
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,200
your loyalty.

384
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,580
But what about your daughter?

385
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,360
What happened to her?

386
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,050
You know our deputy captain Inoue, right?

387
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,090
He specifically

388
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,320
questioned your daughter as routine.

389
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,120
Not answering would have been fine.

390
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:47,760
But

391
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:49,840
she went and complained to

392
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,520
Major Takeki who just arrived on the island.

393
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,200
She accused Inoue

394
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,540
of attempting to rape her.

395
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,380
Because of this, Inoue

396
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,000
was confined by the Major.

397
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,540
He's still in the detention room now.

398
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,880
He's shouting that

399
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,890
he'll settle scores with your daughter once he gets out.

400
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,960
Captain Oshima, I beg you.

401
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,560
My daughter was young and naive.

402
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,810
Please ask Captain Inoue to let her go.

403
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,840
All these years,

404
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,770
my daughter and I

405
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,760
have been loyally working for you.

406
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,560
We've never been disloyal.

407
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,200
Please ask Captain Inoue to spare her.

408
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,680
There's nothing I can do.

409
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,320
That's just how he is.

410
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,960
He respects no one

411
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,280
and fears no one.

412
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:40,320
No, no.

413
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:43,250
He listens to you. He respects you.

414
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,920
If there's anything I, Tang Bingchen, can do,

415
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:48,480
I'll do my utmost.

416
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:50,640
Chairman,

417
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,600
rest assured,

418
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,850
I don't approve of such crude actions either.

419
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:56,680
Thank you,

420
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,250
thank you, Captain Oshima.

421
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,740
After coming back, I heard

422
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:10,600
that wealthy families on this island

423
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,240
all have secret rooms, is that true?

424
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,080
Yes, that's true.

425
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,450
Where are these secret rooms located?

426
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,250
Captain Oshima,

427
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,500
I honestly don't know about that.

428
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,120
If I'm lying,

429
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,220
may I die a terrible death.

430
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:30,840
Hmm,

431
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,560
I believe you.

432
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,160
Does anyone else know?

433
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:41,640
Each family only knows about their own.

434
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,500
They know nothing about others'.

435
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:44,760
Secret rooms...

436
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:47,600
they're used to store valuable possessions

437
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,580
that can't be known to others.

438
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,480
That makes sense.

439
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,480
Who built these houses?

440
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,040
People brought in from outside the island.

441
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,760
They left after finishing construction.

442
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,560
Outsiders...

443
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,260
Did no islanders participate

444
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,480
when these houses were being built?

445
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,360
Well...

446
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,280
It's alright.

447
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,640
Take your time to think about it.

448
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:16,840
You may go.

449
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,680
Anyway, Inoue will come out at night.

450
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,250
Captain Oshima.

451
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,000
I just remembered.

452
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,160
There's a fortune teller on the island.

453
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,760
When people are particular about building houses,

454
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:43,800
they invite him to check the feng shui.

455
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,860
Maybe he knows something about this.

456
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,680
Are you talking about

457
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:55,600
that old man

458
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,800
west of Tanjiawan?

459
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:58,960
Right?

460
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,120
Ah.

461
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:16,760
Sasaki.

462
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:21,800
Go release Captain Jingshang.

463
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,360
Yes, sir.

464
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,730
You understand.

465
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:30,920
It's all right.

466
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,360
We need to find that old man.

467
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:36,370
Thank you

468
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,780
for your cooperation.

469
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,240
Some fortune teller you are.

470
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,720
You couldn't even predict your own capture.

471
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,000
Get him!

472
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,960
What were you all

473
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,220
babbling about later?

474
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,040
The island's Special Police Unit

475
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:34,080
already knows there was a fourth person on the plane.

476
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,740
This is a very dangerous sign.

477
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,480
We must locate the Major as soon as possible.

478
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,320
So tonight...

479
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:39,880
I know.

480
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,840
I need to go back and talk properly with Fourth Aunt

481
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,080
and my father, right?

482
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,700
Your father is a diplomat.

483
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,000
This matter shouldn't be difficult.

484
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,800
But tonight,

485
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,240
you've seen and heard everything.

486
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,200
For your piano,

487
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,960
for waiting for your return,

488
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,330
he was actually willing to beg Fujita.

489
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,720
A father like him

490
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,130
would never accept our relationship.

491
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,820
What should we do then?

492
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,570
Although the situation is urgent,

493
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,000
I hope you can be patient.

494
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,880
I'll come first thing tomorrow morning.

495
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,880
If all else fails,

496
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,080
I'll be straightforward with them

497
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,480
and try to gain his trust.

498
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:26,360
Get some rest.

499
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,320
You sing well.

500
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,460
And you dance pretty well too.

501
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,320
Mrs. Si.

502
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,520
Yingying is back.

503
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,380
Where's my dad?

504
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,200
Is he in a good mood today?

505
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,840
I need to talk to him about something.

506
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,040
Your father went out with your brother.

507
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,250
They're out.

508
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,600
Where did they go?

509
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,240
How would I know?

510
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:15,760
Grandma.

511
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,560
Look me in the eyes.

512
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:19,800
Where did they go?

513
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:20,800
Oh my.

514
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,120
My dear child.

515
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:23,520
You.

516
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,920
You've been afraid of your father since you were little.

517
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,250
And you always bully me.

518
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,720
How would I know where they went?

519
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:32,280
It's fine if you won't tell me.

520
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,460
I'll find them myself.

521
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,280
Dad, do you think that place is good?

522
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,740
Let's go with that one.

523
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,480
Yingying.

524
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,560
Oh my goodness, in the middle of the night!

525
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,960
What are you looking for?

526
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,080
I'm looking for the person you've been hiding.

527
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:57,680
What?

528
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,000
What are you

529
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,720
talking about?

530
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:04,020
Don't tell your sister about this, okay?

531
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,320
Ying'er.

532
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,200
Dad.

533
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,000
You're back.

534
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:27,720
Yeah.

535
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:31,600
I need to talk to you about something.

536
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,120
Beautiful!

537
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,920
Your mother sure knew how to make pretty children.

538
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,250
Even prettier than her.

539
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,410
What did you say?

540
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,130
I need to talk to you.

541
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,290
Come with me.

542
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,020
When did you change it?

543
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:57,680
Today.

544
00:33:58,920 --> 00:33:59,760
Looks nice.

545
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,250
Much better than the previous one.

546
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,010
Go ahead.

547
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:04,800
Mrs. Si.

548
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:06,480
Don't go.

549
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,139
Let father and daughter have a good talk.

550
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,800
You go rest, it's fine.

551
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:24,360
What do you want to talk to me about?

552
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:24,960
Go ahead.

553
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,080
Beautiful.

554
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,960
Even more beautiful than the previous one.

555
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:47,840
Speak.

556
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:48,880
Alright.

557
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,719
Put them on.

558
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,800
They look even better when worn.

559
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,540
Fine, tell me what's going on.

560
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:05,840
Dad,

561
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:10,720
has anyone been visiting our home recently?

562
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:16,520
Those Japanese have been here quite often.

563
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,360
Who else?

564
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,520
Wumu.

565
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,480
Anyone else?

566
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,560
No one else.

567
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:28,800
No one?

568
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,120
Then why were you out so late?

569
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:32,600
You're constantly

570
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,060
coming and going with that Japanese person.

571
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,380
The villagers are all gossiping now.

572
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,720
Your brother and I

573
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,720
have to explain everything to the villagers.

574
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,920
So where do you think I went?

575
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:46,960
Please?

576
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,410
I know you're always the best to me.

577
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:52,840
Fine.

578
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,360
Dad,

579
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,080
I saw that piano.

580
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,930
Thank you for keeping it for me.

581
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:11,960
You saw Fujita?

582
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,200
Stay away from those people,

583
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:19,730
understand?

584
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,120
I understand.

585
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,520
Is this all you wanted to ask about?

586
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,040
Nothing else?

587
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,570
Alright then, get some rest early.

588
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,690
There's one more thing.

589
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,240
What?

590
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,260
Is it comfortable?

591
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:45,810
The glasses.

592
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:50,600
They're new.

593
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,600
A bit tight.

594
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,520
I mean,

595
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,040
you seem happy wearing them.

596
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:30,880
Caught you!

597
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,720
Welcome.

598
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:40,170
We've been waiting for you.

599
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:42,720
Old man.

600
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,840
Do you want to live or die?

601
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:48,640
Do good deeds through the years,

602
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,000
and all will be well.

603
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,560
Old man.

604
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,000
I heard you're a fortune teller.

605
00:37:58,520 --> 00:37:59,360
Then tell me.

606
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,200
Can you make it out of here alive?

607
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,000
Yin and yang.

608
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,800
The cycle never ends.

609
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,800
Affairs of love.

610
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:12,720
Good and evil.

611
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,120
Morality.

612
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,640
Stop. I get it.

613
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:18,360
Let's do this.

614
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:23,000
Read my fortune.

615
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:32,120
You want me to read

616
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,720
your fortune?

617
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,220
What are you doing?

618
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,560
Hand.

619
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,740
Left and right.

620
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:49,880
[Male Left]

621
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,160
Sir,

622
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,960
I cannot read your fortune.

623
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:06,880
Why not?

624
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,520
Do you want to hear

625
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,240
the truth or a lie?

626
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,060
He's actually offering to tell lies.

627
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,680
It's the first time someone has asked me

628
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,000
if I want to hear lies.

629
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,160
Of course I want the truth.

630
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,940
The space between your eyebrows is dark,

631
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,000
a sign of impending disaster.

632
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,770
What are you talking about?

633
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:50,280
All evil deeds committed in the past

634
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,020
arise from beginningless

635
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,720
greed, anger, and delusion.

636
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,520
Old man,

637
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,480
what does that mean?

638
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:57,720
Sir,

639
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,610
a person's eyes belong to fire,

640
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:03,520
mouth and ears to water,

641
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,680
nose to earth,

642
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,040
forehead to wood.

643
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,960
Your eyes reveal a fierce light,

644
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,920
your fire energy is excessive.

645
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,840
You will surely meet disaster through fire.

646
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,480
This is so annoying.

647
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,520
Stop!

648
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,880
What are you doing?

649
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:38,200
To this frail old man?

650
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,050
He doesn't have much time left.

651
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,680
Let him sit down.

652
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,360
Yes.

653
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,210
Everyone leave now.

654
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:00,840
Yes.

655
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,840
I'm sorry, sir.

656
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,320
Today

657
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,530
we invited you here because

658
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,080
we want to build a courtyard.

659
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:24,840
But

660
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:28,120
we really don't understand these matters.

661
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:28,720
So

662
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,260
please check if the feng shui is good.

663
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,410
My subordinates were inconsiderate.

664
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,210
I'm truly sorry about that.

665
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:46,480
Apologize to him.

666
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,960
I'm sorry.

667
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:00,600
This sketch.

668
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,000
This is the courtyard,

669
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,480
and this is the front hall,

670
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,560
the back hall.

671
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:12,840
The key point is.

672
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,960
We need to build

673
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,360

674
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,160
