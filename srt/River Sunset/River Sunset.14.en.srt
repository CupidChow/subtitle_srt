1
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,800
I'll kill you.

2
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,600
If this happens again,

3
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,960
I'll shoot you dead.

4
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,640
Go.

5
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,880
Let me go.

6
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,800
Let me go.

7
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,400
Huihui.

8
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:06,600
Stop!

9
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,940
What are you doing?

10
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:08,580
Huihui.

11
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:09,780
Huihui.

12
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,480
What are you doing in front of the Colonel?

13
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,480
This crazy woman bit me!

14
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,240
What are you doing here?

15
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,400
Sister Ying'er,

16
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,200
help me!

17
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,400
Where is your father?

18
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,120
Father

19
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,000
and my brother were killed by them.

20
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:23,880
You must save me!

21
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:24,810
Sister Ying'er,

22
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,720
please save me!

23
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,780
I'll take you away.

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,800
Miss Ye.

25
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:29,920
I'm sorry.

26
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,160
Captain Oshima ordered us to take this woman

27
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,520
to the police station immediately.

28
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,000
I don't want to go!

29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Comfort women

30
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,600
are all registered with the military.

31
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,120
I don't want to go!

32
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm taking her with me.

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I don't want to go!

34
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,560
Save me!

35
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,960
This is beyond my jurisdiction.

36
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,760
Take her away.

37
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,360
Sister Ying!

38
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,480
Sister Ying!

39
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,500
Please save me!

40
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:55,120
Don't you dare leave!

41
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:56,320
Let her go!

42
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:56,960
Sister Ying!

43
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,960
Let go!

44
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,200
Save me, Sister Ying!

45
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,360
Sister Ying!

46
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,000
I thought you didn't care about anything.

47
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,400
Why are you following me?

48
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:40,760
You can't save them.

49
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,620
I'll go back and save them myself.

50
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,160
Let me go.

51
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,220
Let go of me.

52
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,200
Release me.

53
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,240
I swear by my own judgment

54
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,050
to keep the following oath.

55
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,520
I swear that according to my ability

56
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,680
and judgment,

57
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,160
I will keep this oath to benefit the sick

58
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,420
as my moral principle,

59
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,600
to avoid all corruption

60
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,680
and harm to others.

61
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,320
Wherever I go,

62
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,280
regardless of whether my patients are male or female,

63
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,920
free citizens or slaves,

64
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,200
I will treat them all equally.

65
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:07,600
I will seek their happiness

66
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,760
as my only purpose.

67
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,800
I am willing to keep these oaths

68
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,320
so that Apollo, the god of medicine,

69
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,320
Asclepius,

70
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,240
and all the gods may grant me life

71
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,959
and supreme glory in medicine.

72
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,399
If I break this oath,

73
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,079
may I suffer

74
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,480
the most severe judgment from all the gods.

75
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,280
The Hippocratic Oath.

76
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,000
Every doctor follows it.

77
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,240
It speaks of compassion,

78
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,600
salvation,

79
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,880
and equality.

80
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,960
Please tell me,

81
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,720
have you ever seen a patient

82
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,580
die right on the operating table?

83
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,370
Of course I have.

84
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,610
Why didn't you save him?

85
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,080
Doctors aren't omnipotent.

86
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,200
Neither am I.

87
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,280
But you didn't even try.

88
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,160
How could you just...

89
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,560
Acting on impulse

90
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,570
will only compromise our actions.

91
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,840
Rash actions will only backfire.

92
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,160
I hope you never forget

93
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,820
why we came back to the island.

94
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,360
We're already in grave danger.

95
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,440
If we make one wrong move,

96
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,400
you, me, your family,

97
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,160
and the Major could all lose our lives.

98
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,610
The Major came to China,

99
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,120
but what mission is he carrying?

100
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,800
What kind of international operation is involved?

101
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,320
We know nothing about it.

102
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,800
If this operation

103
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,720
truly has a decisive impact

104
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,000
on the entire Eastern front,

105
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,400
then it means we can only succeed.

106
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,480
Failure is not an option.

107
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,600
Because if we fail,

108
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,280
it will affect our entire country

109
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,010
and the survival of our people.

110
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,840
You are a smart

111
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,000
and innocent girl.

112
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:08,880
Perhaps in the future you'll become complex,

113
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,880
sophisticated,

114
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,880
cold and heartless like me.

115
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,860
I don't want to deliberately taint your innocence.

116
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,400
I know it's your most precious quality.

117
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:27,600
But

118
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,000
we need to survive first.

119
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,800
Because only if we survive

120
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,880
can we possibly change this world.

121
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,280
Only if we survive

122
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,360
can we protect those we love.

123
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:43,600
Therefore,

124
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,200
I need to add something heavy

125
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,480
to your innocence.

126
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:56,920
I'm sorry.

127
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,560
Don't move.

128
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,480
I'm sorry.

129
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,600
Don't move.

130
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,330
If you move, I won't be able to insert it properly.

131
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:16,880
Get out.

132
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,320
Get out.

133
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:26,920
Nurse Tang,

134
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,680
you have such a beautiful face.

135
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm working.

136
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,919
Please leave.

137
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,200
You think

138
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,080
you can escape from me?

139
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,200
Nurse Tang,

140
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,560
today you're still hoping...

141
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,490
Is that colonel coming to save you?

142
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,720
Today you're already in my hands.

143
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,680
I'd like to see who can save you now.

144
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:04,890
I'm working.

145
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,600
Please leave.

146
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,760
Cooperate with us.

147
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,480
Come with us.

148
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,840
Let's go to the police station.

149
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:18,200
Captain Oshima has some questions for you.

150
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,480
Don't worry.

151
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:26,680
I'll make sure you get what you deserve.

152
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,200
I'm not going.

153
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,480
You're not going?

154
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,760
You have to go anyway.

155
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,720
Yes.

156
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,840
Let me go!

157
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,160
I'm not going!

158
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,240
Let me go!

159
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,840
What crime have I committed?

160
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,680
That doesn't matter.

161
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,440
This is the face

162
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,880
I've been thinking about for days.

163
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,500
You've finally fallen into my hands.

164
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,680
You won't escape this time.

165
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,880
Dr. Kozu.

166
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,400
What are you doing here?

167
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,200
Kozu.

168
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:08,760
Hello there.

169
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,800
We're currently

170
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,560
taking an important witness back to the station.

171
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,440
Please don't interfere.

172
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,880
Dr. Kozu.

173
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,560
Dr. Kozu.

174
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,160
Let me go!

175
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,440
Dr. Kozu.

176
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,560
Captain.

177
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,600
Captain.

178
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:38,800
Captain.

179
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,880
We'll

180
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,080
continue this next time.

181
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:47,880
Yes.

182
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,280
Did you find out

183
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:57,880
why Colonel Takeki

184
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:58,840
came to our base?

185
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,240
Deputy Sakamoto says

186
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,320
Colonel Takeki's visit to the Sixth Air Base

187
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,760
is likely related to General Osumi's matter.

188
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,200
It also involves

189
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,800
the conflict between the Imperial Way Faction and the Control Faction,

190
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,360
the Southern Expansion Faction and the Northern Expansion Faction,

191
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,280
and their power struggles.

192
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,640
What he brought

193
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,560
is a document

194
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,400
personally signed by His Majesty the Emperor.

195
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,960
He said

196
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,400
we must not

197
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:39,080
get involved in this matter.

198
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,360
Captain,

199
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,640
what should we do next?

200
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,400
Let me think.

201
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,120
Colonel Wumu

202
00:11:57,640 --> 00:12:01,600
is an investigator from the Imperial Palace Chamberlain's Office

203
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:08,160
and possesses investigation documents personally signed by the Emperor.

204
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,200
Clearly he's from the Cabinet

205
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,440
Investigation Bureau.

206
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,240
Cabinet Investigation Bureau.

207
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,640
If we continue this investigation,

208
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,960
we'll likely get caught in power struggles between higher-ups.

209
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,600
We might become sacrificial lambs.

210
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,120
So what should we do?

211
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,200
I have zero interest in power struggles at the top.

212
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,720
Let the Colonel carry out his mission.

213
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,720
Investigate this Ye Biying thoroughly

214
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,650
to prevent her from becoming a threat to the Colonel.

215
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,840
If we uncover any issues with her,

216
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,360
the Colonel will surely be grateful.

217
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,160
Also,

218
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,800
have you found that American who fell from the plane?

219
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,720
Any news?

220
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,920
This is still under investigation.

221
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:05,880
What about

222
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:07,760
the missing sentinel?

223
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,240
I will do my utmost to investigate, sir.

224
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,740
Two people vanished into thin air

225
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,220
after the Colonel and this woman arrived on the island.

226
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:52,280
Why did you bring me here?

227
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,640
I want to go back.

228
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,360
What did I do wrong?

229
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:56,960
What have I done wrong?

230
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,200
Darling,

231
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,460
you look so energetic.

232
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,160
What's that?

233
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,210
Let's go check it out together.

234
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,200
Why are you hesitating?

235
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:16,720
Come on.

236
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:17,760
Come on.

237
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:19,480
Come on.

238
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,880
Why did you bring me here?

239
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,640
Come here.

240
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,520
This way.

241
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,320
Do you know her?

242
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,360
Who is she?

243
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,000
Be careful.

244
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,920
You could be next.

245
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,400
Which one should I choose?

246
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,200
But this isn't enough.

247
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,330
It's not hot enough.

248
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,320
This one is good.

249
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,240
This is perfect.

250
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,610
Deputy Captain.

251
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,720
Wait for me.

252
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,120
Watch carefully.

253
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,560
As expected of the Captain.

254
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:49,000
Today they'll probably confess to everything.

255
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,600
This is just routine procedure.

256
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,480
Don't do anything to her.

257
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,640
After all, her father

258
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,560
is the chairman of the Maintenance Association.

259
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,880
I know.

260
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,160
Come to my office for a meeting after the interrogation.

261
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:02,560
Yes.

262
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,760
Hey, you know who I'm talking about,

263
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,520
Mr. Li.

264
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,560
When you talk to the villagers in the future,

265
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,200
don't be so aggressive.

266
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:22,480
The Japanese are dangerous.

267
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,680
We have to be careful around them.

268
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,240
You see the villagers every day.

269
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,520
What are you thinking?

270
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,960
What's going on here?

271
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,080
Chairman Tang.

272
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,360
Come here.

273
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,680
Come here.

274
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,680
Mr. Fukuda,

275
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,760
come in and have a drink with me.

276
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,640
Come here.

277
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,520
Mr. Fukuda.

278
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,360
The Maintenance Association still has many matters to attend to.

279
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,800
Perhaps we could meet another day?

280
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,520
No need to reschedule.

281
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,400
Today is perfect.

282
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,600
The shop just received new merchandise today.

283
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,800
Let me treat you to something fresh.

284
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,160
Come here.

285
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,360
Wait.

286
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,440
You two go ahead.

287
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,200
Hurry up.

288
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:09,000
Go on.

289
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:10,520
Come here.

290
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,200
I'll do it.

291
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,520
Come here.

292
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,119
Bring the wine quickly.

293
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,200
Sit down.

294
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:23,440
Not this one.

295
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,520
We need the special wine.

296
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,200
Oh.

297
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,800
That old guy

298
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:44,720
turns into a mess after just a little alcohol.

299
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,160
If he were Japanese, he'd be ridiculed.

300
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,080
Come here.

301
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,120
Come here.

302
00:17:58,360 --> 00:17:58,960
Come here.

303
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,200
Tang Ju'er.

304
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,560
I'm back.

305
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,520
Let her go,

306
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,680
I'll tell you everything.

307
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,060
Don't touch me.

308
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,320
Don't touch me.

309
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,600
I've told you.

310
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,720
Good girl.

311
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,560
Put her down.

312
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,840
Tang Ju'er.

313
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,100
It's just the two of us now.

314
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,840
I've already said

315
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,300
it's just the two of us now.

316
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,200
It's just us two.

317
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:10,920
Let's go.

318
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,480
I heard you want to challenge me.

319
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,280
Have a drinking contest with me.

320
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,760
I wouldn't dare.

321
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,200
Sir,

322
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,240
I really can't.

323
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,120
Drink up.

324
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:31,930
[Drinks]

325
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,080
I didn't mean to.

326
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:58,760
Please spare me, sir.

327
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,480
Have mercy!

328
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,600
Drink.

329
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,680
Sir,

330
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,320
please spare me.

331
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,080
I can't drink anymore.

332
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,360
I told you to drink them.

333
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,580
I really can't drink anymore.

334
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,800
Don't move at all.

335
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,240
Open your mouth.

336
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,600
Don't move.

337
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,520
Stay still.

338
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,320
Sergeant, sir.

339
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,440
Fukuda.

340
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,640
Who is this person?

341
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,440
The interpreter.

342
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,320
What brings you here?

343
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:26,520
Commander Fujita

344
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:29,480
has always emphasized treating the island residents with leniency.

345
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,560
Besides, Chairman Tang has been serving the Imperial Army all along.

346
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,760
Please show mercy

347
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,880
and let him go.

348
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,240
The Commander has repeatedly ordered

349
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,200
that soldiers on the island are strictly forbidden to drink alcohol.

350
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,330
Please mind your behavior, Corporal.

351
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,960
Today's meal

352
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,160
is on me, Fukuda.

353
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,840
Please be merciful

354
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,520
and go back to rest.

355
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,600
I did it.

356
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,120
Are you okay?

357
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,880
Translator Luo.

358
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,200
Have you heard

359
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,080
that Captain Daodao Hao

360
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,080
raided the secret room in the Ye family's old house?

361
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,140
I heard they confiscated quite a lot.

362
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,160
Yes, I heard about it.

363
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:10,840
Oh my,

364
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,160
now

365
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,800
will the Ye family fall into ruin?

366
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,120
Are you worried

367
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,050
your daughter might live in poverty after marrying into their family?

368
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:26,480
Marrying into the Ye family?

369
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,120
I never agreed to that.

370
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,880
I'm concerned about Old Master Ye.

371
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,610
After all, he's a respected figure on the island.

372
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,690
That's true.

373
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,400
Could you be good to my daughter Ju'er?

374
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,160
What do you mean?

375
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:54,160
In these troubled times,

376
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,960
a young girl out there

377
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,560
always makes one worry.

378
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,800
Come.

379
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:07,760
Initially, I just wanted to work for the Japanese

380
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,920
to be their messenger

381
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,520
to keep my daughter safe.

382
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:13,920
But it seems that's not reliable.

383
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,080
Unlike you, with your talents and wisdom.

384
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,050
Even the Japanese respect you.

385
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,400
You flatter me.

386
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,180
The Japanese don't respect me at all.

387
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,760
They're merely concerned about

388
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,290
Commander Fujita's reputation, that's all.

389
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,000
Living in chaotic times,

390
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,600
I'm also just trying to survive.

391
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:34,400
I had no choice but to take shelter under the Japanese military flag.

392
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,400
Actually, I'm just like you.

393
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,720
We all have to live by the Japanese whims.

394
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,960
I'm old now.

395
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,560
These old bones are useless.

396
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,280
If Ju'er could find someone like you to rely on,

397
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,800
how wonderful that would be.

398
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:55,240
Then

399
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,760
I wouldn't have to worry constantly

400
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,220
about her being mistreated by the Japanese.

401
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,360
Come.

402
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,290
Let's not talk about this anymore.

403
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,570
Translator Luo,

404
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:11,480
let me tell you,

405
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,200
my daughter Ju'er,

406
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,960
she's so filial

407
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,120
at home.

408
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:18,980
Chairman Tang.

409
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,120
What's wrong,

410
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,100
Chairman Tang?

411
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,760
Ju'er has been taken by the police.

412
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,120
How did Ju'er get taken by the police?

413
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,200
I don't know.

414
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:26,680
Let's go see.

415
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,210
Let's go.

416
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:28,880
Come on.

417
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,600
Tang Ju'er.

418
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:41,160
I'm giving you two options.

419
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:46,000
Tell me everything you know,

420
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,240
but don't tell a single lie.

421
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,240
I'm going to hand you over to my men

422
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,760
and have them question you here.

423
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,760
You can lie to them all you want.

424
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:03,280
I don't lie.

425
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,400
I don't lie.

426
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:06,640
Fine.

427
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,960
Tang Ju'er, don't cry.

428
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,560
Let's begin.

429
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:18,400
Tell me

430
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:22,320
what you know about Miss Ye.

431
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,640
What do you want to know?

432
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:28,360
Anything.

433
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,960
Then let's start from childhood.

434
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:39,240
I grew up with Biying.

435
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,920
In 1936,

436
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,160
we left Sanzao Island for Guangzhou.

437
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:51,800
Then I went to nursing school.

438
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:54,120
She...

439
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,320
she attended women's normal school.

440
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:57,920
At that time,

441
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,080
we were often together.

442
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,720
After the New Year,

443
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:05,400
she asked me to go north with her.

444
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:06,920
And then...

445
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:07,920
Hey!

446
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:10,920
Where exactly is 'north'?

447
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:18,720
Everyone was saying Guangzhou would soon be at war.

448
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,520
My father

449
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,320
wrote to me asking me to return to Sanzao Island.

450
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,520
He said Guangzhou wasn't safe,

451
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,440
so I didn't go.

452
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,760
I'm asking you,

453
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:35,520
where exactly is 'north'?

454
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,440
You didn't go to Yan'an.

455
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:43,800
In Shanghai,

456
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,100
to survive in Shanghai...

457
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,720
I had no choice,

458
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,450
so I went to work at a dance hall.

459
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,600
Ju'er.

460
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,320
There's one more thing.

461
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,080
If anyone asks about me in the future,

462
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,200
just say you don't know.

463
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,560
Where exactly is 'north'?

464
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,520
Shanghai.

465
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,240
Shanghai.

466
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,600
Shanghai.

467
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,600
Do you dare to lie?

468
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,960
I'm not lying.

469
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,080
Since that year,

470
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:23,000
we haven't seen each other until she came back this time.

471
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:25,640
Shanghai.

472
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,360
Where in Shanghai?

473
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,120
She said.

474
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,160
She said.

475
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,170
She said.

476
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:42,960
She said at a dance hall.

477
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,560
Do you dare to lie?

478
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,400
I'm not lying.

479
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,440
You're lying.

480
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,240
I'm not.

481
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,520
I'm not lying.

482
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,600
Ju'er! Ju'er!

483
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,400
Stop!

484
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,200
I'm looking for my daughter Ju'er.

485
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:00,960
No entry.

486
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,280
Tang Ju'er, where are you?

487
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:06,120
Father!

488
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,160
Father!

489
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,480
Father, I'm here!

490
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,600
Father!

491
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:15,960
Keep an eye on her.

492
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,680
Yes, sir.

493
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,600
Father, I'm here.

494
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,280
Tang Ju'er, where are you? Ju'er!

495
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,080
Hey! What are you doing?

496
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:28,600
What's going on?

497
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:29,760
Captain.

498
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,200
You've taken my daughter.

499
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,240
Why are you locking her up?

500
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:33,560
Let me tell you.

501
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,440
Have you done anything to her?

502
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,280
Absolutely not.

503
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:35,880
I want to see her.

504
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,320
Go back.

505
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,960
No, I just want to see my daughter.

506
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,720
Let me through, please. Get out of my way.

507
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,200
Why did you come here?

508
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,760
What are you doing here?

509
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,880
I didn't mean to.

510
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:53,960
What do you mean 'didn't mean to'?

511
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,480
I just want to see my daughter.

512
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,800
Stop right there!

513
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:01,080
Stop hitting him!

514
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,740
I just want to see my daughter.

515
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,200
The commander told you not to make trouble.

516
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,920
What damn commander?

517
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:15,200
None of the commander's business.

518
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,360
Ju'er!

519
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,930
I'm looking for my daughter Ju'er.

520
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,320
Bring him here.

521
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,560
Don't move or I'll kill you.

522
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,440
Stay still or I'll shoot.

523
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,880
Captain.

524
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:31,960
Wait.

525
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,560
The chief wants to see you.

526
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,160
Wait for me here.

527
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,690
All of you, wait for me here.

528
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,280
Stand straight.

529
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,440
That dog Tang Bingchen

530
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,800
how dare he lay hands on me!

531
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,280
Calm down now.

532
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:07,600
If you keep causing trouble like this,

533
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,460
aren't you afraid the Commander will hear about it?

534
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:12,520
I didn't think it through.

535
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,120
Did Tang Ju'er say anything?

536
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:14,920
No.

537
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,160
Let her go for now.

538
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,000
Release her.

539
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,280
Come back later for the meeting.

540
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,680
Return for the meeting shortly.

541
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,120
Is everyone here?

542
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,280
Sasaki.

543
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:19,720
Report to everyone

544
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,250
about your situation at headquarters again.

545
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,320
I'll begin my report now.

546
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,560
The Colonel's reason for coming to our island

547
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,600
is related to

548
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:33,240
General Minoru Osumi's plane crash last year.

549
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:36,560
This matter may also involve

550
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:42,360
the internal conflict between the Imperial Way Faction and the Control Faction in the military.

551
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,160
He brought investigation documents personally signed by the Emperor

552
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:51,960
to our Sixth Air Base.

553
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:59,400
Therefore, we must not

554
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,280
get involved in this matter.

555
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:04,720
That's all Sakamoto told us.

556
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,660
Report concluded.

557
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,080
Originally, we had no suspicions

558
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,240
about the Colonel from the Imperial Palace.

559
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,160
We were only concerned

560
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,620
about the Chinese woman he brought with him.

561
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,840
Did you all hear that?

562
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,000
Does anyone among you know

563
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,860
what the Imperial Way Faction and Control Faction are?

564
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,680
That's right.

565
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:45,360
We don't need to know about these

566
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:50,440
meaningless power struggles at the top.

567
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,680
Just remember one thing:

568
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,760
these internal conflicts,

569
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,080
no matter which faction,

570
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,360
we can't afford to offend any of them.

571
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,640
We don't need to make enemies everywhere.

572
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,600
Those bureaucrats

573
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,280
would sacrifice our remote base

574
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,210
and special police force officers

575
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,760
like stepping on an ant.

576
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:15,320
The current situation is the calm before the storm.

577
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:16,800
Don't cause any trouble.

578
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,560
So,

579
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:23,679
we've discovered so many

580
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:25,880
suspicious things about Colonel Wumu.

581
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:30,760
And that woman from the Ye family

582
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,440
also has many suspicious points.

583
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,370
Are we not investigating any of it?

584
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:41,360
Are you questioning the Emperor's investigator?

585
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,679
That's not what I meant.

586
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:46,280
I just want to know

587
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,719
about that American who parachuted down.

588
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:49,080
Do we not need to continue the investigation?

589
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,840
What about the missing sentinel?

590
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,679
Do we keep searching?

591
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,330
These matters need to be handled separately.

592
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,810
As for the person who jumped from the American plane,

593
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,980
of course we must continue searching

594
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,800
until we catch him.

595
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,890
We need to conduct a high-profile search.

596
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,920
That American

597
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:12,120
is probably no longer in the village.

598
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,080
So there must be a traitor in the village.

599
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:20,800
Follow the trail and we'll smoke them out.

600
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,240
What about the search for the missing sentinel?

601
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,460
Leave it to the garrison to continue searching.

602
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,760
We need to find him, dead or alive.

603
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,920
As for the Ye family,

604
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,320
we need to ease tensions.

605
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,480
Return all items

606
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:42,140
confiscated yesterday from their secret room.

607
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,120
Return everything?

608
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:48,920
Is there a problem?

609
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,680
I understand.

610
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,880
Did you really hear me?

611
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,680
I'll return everything.

612
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,360
Then go do it right away.

613
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,680
Yes, sir.

614
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:04,680
Meeting adjourned.

615
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:05,400
Yes.

616
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:13,920
Sasaki.

617
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,000
Yes.

618
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:15,960
Don't leave yet.

619
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:16,920
Yes.

620
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,120
Ju'er.

621
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,480
Forget it.

622
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,200
Just treat it like being bitten by a dog.

623
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,520
This Inoue

624
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,440
is truly despicable.

625
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,560
Even bullying our family.

626
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,440
Tell me,

627
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,570
how can people on this island survive?

628
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,360
Forget it.

629
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,890
When you're under someone's roof,

630
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,800
who can avoid bowing their head?

631
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:06,120
It seems that as chairman,

632
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:08,320
I'm not of much use anymore.

633
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,920
When making marriage connections nowadays,

634
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,640
you not only need equal social status,

635
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:15,300
but also need strong backing.

636
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,760
As for Ju'er,

637
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,240
she really needs to find someone reliable.

638
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,240
What worries me most now

639
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,000
is my daughter Ju'er

640
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,760
in these chaotic times.

641
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:36,770
Translator Luo,

642
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:39,880
you young people communicate better.

643
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,320
Please go talk some sense into her.

644
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:42,000
No, no, no.

645
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,880
It's not appropriate for me to go.

646
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,880
You should go instead.

647
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:44,640
Come on.

648
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:45,600
Translator Luo, I'm begging you.

649
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,460
I'm begging you, Translator Luo.

650
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,200
Please, I beg you.

651
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,400
Go away.

652
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,600
Ju'er,

653
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:08,480
don't be sad.

654
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,240
Ju'er.

655
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:21,210
You'll harm your health if you go on like this.

656
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,080
Listen to me.

657
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,000
Life is short.

658
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,440
One moment of patience can save you trouble.

659
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:33,680
There's still a long way to go.

660
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,480
Get out.

661
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:35,760
I'm doing this for your own good.

662
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,960
Please leave.

663
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,520
Ju'er, be reasonable.

664
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:44,680
Come, translator.

665
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:45,610
Have some water.

666
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,160
Or I can...

667
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:48,600
Sit down.

668
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,280
Always drinking.

669
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:51,600
Ju'er.

670
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:52,960
Ju'er.

671
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,200
Where are you going?

672
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,840
We have no way to investigate the Colonel.

673
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,520
This is really troublesome.

674
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,320
To break this deadlock,

675
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:19,690
we need to find that American as soon as possible.

676
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,040
Alright.

677
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:24,840
In the village,

678
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,900
Lieutenant Inoue has already led you

679
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,200
on several searches.

680
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:34,180
The Ye family, who are most likely to hide the American,

681
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,960
yielded nothing as well.

682
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,520
So we should expand our search area.

683
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,840
Now we need to make a show of force

684
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:45,840
to get the Ye family to point us in the right direction.

685
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:50,560
Abandoned villages, caves,

686
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:54,560
and coastal cliffs.

687
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,280
All places that the Ye family can reach

688
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,600
quickly from the village

689
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,440
need to be thoroughly searched.

690
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,840
Especially

691
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,400
abandoned villages,

692
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:08,290
which make the best hiding places.

693
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,880
We just need the Ye family to give us a direction.

694
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:11,720
Captain,

695
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:13,200
first thing tomorrow morning,

696
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,680
I'll send the second platoon to Tanjia Bay.

697
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:15,680
All right.

698
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,280
By the way,

699
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:19,800
please make arrangements

700
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,840
to call Mr. Fukuda.

701
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:25,960
I want to invite the Major to dinner at his place in the next few days

702
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,690
to ease the tension between us.

703
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,840
Bring Inoue along as well.

704
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:34,760
Oh, and

705
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,360
I need you to find

706
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,280
all the files on General Osumi's plane crash

707
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:39,360
from last year.

708
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,000
Get it done quickly.

709
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:47,480
The Major will be transferred sooner or later anyway.

710
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,360
I understand.

711
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,440

716
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,640
Great.
