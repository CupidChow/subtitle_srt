1
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:36,539
I'm talking to you.

2
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,000
Say something.

3
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,100
Reporting,

4
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,320
sir.

5
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,120
She's my friend.

6
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,440
She lives at 6 Masefield Road

7
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,520
and works as a dancer at Cathay Grand Ballroom.

8
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,120
She's been drinking too much with customers lately

9
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,320
and has a sore throat.

10
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,520
Sir.

11
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:56,479
She

12
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:57,880
is his friend.

13
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,320
Recently,

14
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,440
she drank too much.

15
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,120
She's a dancer at Cathay Grand Ballroom.

16
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:05,280
Her throat has been bothering her,

17
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,200
so he brought her to the hospital.

18
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:09,759
Really.

19
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,220
The officer is asking you a question.

20
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,400
She's timid.

21
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,200
Don't be afraid.

22
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,520
The officers are good people

23
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,760
who protect us.

24
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:20,640
Miss,

25
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,480
don't worry, it's all right.

26
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,160
Sir.

27
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,160
Please check.

28
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:33,120
Miss,

29
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,040
is it 6 Masefield Road?

30
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,930
Is the address correct?

31
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,160
It's fine.

32
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:40,800
Good.

33
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,440
Thank you.

34
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:41,880
Sir.

35
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,200
In the eyes of the Japanese,

36
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,840
what does life really mean?

37
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,200
That was really dangerous just now.

38
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,160
Fortunately, you didn't follow

39
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,360
our original plan

40
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,120
and answer as a doctor.

41
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:15,760
Otherwise,

42
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,760
with their confrontation just now,

43
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,290
we would have been exposed.

44
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,170
I was sweating bullets for you.

45
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:24,920
By the way,

46
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,480
you just said

47
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,800
I'm from

48
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,320
Guotai...

49
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,040
A dancer at the Guotai Ballroom.

50
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:32,920
A dancer?

51
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,160
How could I possibly be a dancer?

52
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,440
This is our backup plan.

53
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,000
Chen is going to the Xiafei Road location.

54
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:42,880
Yes.

55
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:43,680
No.

56
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,640
Can I change to something else?

57
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,200
Miss Ye,

58
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:51,690
this was an emergency situation. Let's not discuss it further.

59
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,100
Hello, Father.

60
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,640
I'm looking for a book

61
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,040
by Joseph Eva.

62
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,770
It's called 'The Revelation of Enlightenment'.

63
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,120
That's a very rare and excellent book,

64
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,600
but quite difficult to find.

65
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,529
How long will it take to find it?

66
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,120
A very long time.

67
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,080
I can wait as long as it takes.

68
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,280
Thank you.

69
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,320
Young man,

70
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,920
you're not finished yet.

71
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,360
There's one more customer.

72
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,090
Could you give me a shave later?

73
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,320
Hello,

74
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,460
my name is Shen.

75
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,040
Takemura Ichiro.

76
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,520
I don't look like one,

77
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:46,800
do I?

78
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,620
I don't look like a dancer, right?

79
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:57,760
What are you doing?

80
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,560
Let's begin.

81
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,120
Begin what?

82
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,380
Look in the mirror.

83
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,280
You're now a dancer at the Cathay Grand Ballroom.

84
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,960
The person working with you is Rachel.

85
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,960
That's me.

86
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,000
I'm your best friend.

87
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,120
We live together at

88
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,920
Room 106 on the third floor of 6 Maxfield Road.

89
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:18,050
You must remember all of this by heart.

90
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,760
This is your ID card.

91
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:20,930
Ration card.

92
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,360
Medical card.

93
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,840
Dance hostess permit.

94
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,000
These are the details of the dance hall where you'll be working.

95
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,360
Due to today's incident,

96
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,280
your identity as a doctor has been voided.

97
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,680
How do I look anything like a dance hostess?

98
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,560
Guotai Dance Hall

99
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,760
located at 306 Masketuo Road.

100
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,640
The dance hall's main feature

101
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,280
is that the dance floor

102
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,200
is supported by automobile springs.

103
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,680
When people are dancing,

104
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,760
the floor vibrates and tilts,

105
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,320
giving people an exhilarating feeling.

106
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,000
You may begin.

107
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,530
Hurry up.

108
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:48,800
Don't touch me.

109
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,460
Don't move.

110
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,040
Here is a

111
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,080
letter signed by the Japanese Emperor himself.

112
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,520
This is a copy.

113
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,520
Take a look first.

114
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,680
Emperor Showa

115
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,040
Imperial Household Investigation Department

116
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,880
Colonel Takeki Ichiro

117
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,280
ordered to South and Central China

118
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:10,760
to carry out a special investigation mission.

119
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:13,360
The signature forgery looks quite authentic.

120
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,600
Most people wouldn't notice it's fake.

121
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,560
This is the original document.

122
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,680
Keep it safe.

123
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,810
Get yourself ready.

124
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,000
In the next couple of days, we'll take you to

125
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,920
where your identity was accidentally exposed.

126
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:29,760
What place?

127
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,720
Inoue Mansion

128
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,919
Come in.

129
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,850
For this operation,

130
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,120
we've arranged an assistant for you

131
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,049
named Ye Biying.

132
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,530
Here's her file.

133
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,640
Take a look.

134
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:45,520
Don't trust me,

135
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,720
so you're sending someone to watch me?

136
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,880
To assist you.

137
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,560
Whatever.

138
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,440
All the evaluation items

139
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,700
why are they all blank?

140
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,400
This is an internal record.

141
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,080
You only need to know that her current identity

142
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,560
is that of a dancer.

143
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,620
Originally, we didn't plan for a dancer,

144
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,440
but there was a slight complication.

145
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,360
Anyway,

146
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:12,840
this is how things are now.

147
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:13,640
Come,

148
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:15,570
let me introduce you to each other.

149
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,180
After you and she leave Shanghai,

150
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,400
I'll bring people to the opposite side of Sanzao Island,

151
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,160
somewhere around Zhongshan County or Macau,

152
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,080
to ensure your safe evacuation.

153
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,460
If the mission goes smoothly,

154
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,360
you only need to

155
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,280
send telegrams to Tokyo

156
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,320
under the pretext of regular reporting to superiors.

157
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,320
I'll intercept them and make arrangements accordingly.

158
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,280
Takeki Ichiro.

159
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,880
The situation on the island is complicated.

160
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,320
You'll be fighting alone once you're there.

161
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,580
Be extremely careful.

162
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,560
The director instructed that

163
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,280
if you sense any danger,

164
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,520
you may abort the mission on your own.

165
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,400
For escape routes,

166
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,130
we've designated two options.

167
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,640
When you return to the hotel,

168
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,600
you can review the routes

169
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,440
and the maps.

170
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:33,930
Understood.

171
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,640
I want to know

172
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,040
what the American pilot's mission is.

173
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,400
I don't know that.

174
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:42,560
Even the director doesn't know.

175
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,200
We only know

176
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,520
this person is extremely important.

177
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,040
No matter what,

178
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:47,960
we can't let him fall

179
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,320
into Japanese hands.

180
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,560
If possible,

181
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,920
we hope you can find out

182
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,960
what mission he's carrying out in China.

183
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,120
Don't touch me!

184
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,720
Let go!

185
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,720
This person is from the Communist Party.

186
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,980
You need to be careful.

187
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,400
Understood.

188
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,640
The director's orders:

189
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,280
After the mission is completed,

190
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,540
you must eliminate her

191
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,020
and then escape yourself.

192
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,040
How do we confirm

193
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,840
her mission is fully completed?

194
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,180
She helps you find the messenger,

195
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,400
and the secret the messenger carries

196
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,660
falls into your hands.

197
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,740
What about the messenger?

198
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,400
That American,

199
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,160
try to take him with you.

200
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,240
What if I can't?

201
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:35,920
Just try.

202
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,160
Troublesome.

203
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,760
But whether you make it to the island or not,

204
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,720
this girl

205
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,640
knows too many of our secrets.

206
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,520
The outcome will be the same.

207
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,560
Come this way.

208
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,900
Take her over there to have a look.

209
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,520
Yes, come on.

210
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:12,920
Don't move.

211
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:13,680
Begin.

212
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:16,520
Take another one.

213
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,040
Are we

214
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,240
waiting for someone?

215
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,280
Wait.

216
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,640
A man will come out here.

217
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,120
Your mission

218
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,980
is to find a way to get close to him.

219
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,840
When the opportunity arises, steal a pen from him.

220
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:49,300
It contains important intelligence for us.

221
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,810
Such an important task,

222
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,320
but why would you...

223
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,720
Just focus on the mission

224
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,800
and don't ask why.

225
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,200
That's also an essential quality for a special agent.

226
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,040
He's here.

227
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,400
The one in the gray suit.

228
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,640
Hello, Miss Ye.

229
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,040
Here's your wine, enjoy.

230
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,480
Waiter.

231
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,440
What would you like, sir?

232
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:34,840
Hello.

233
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,080
Come on.

234
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,040
Miss Ye,

235
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:58,400
excuse me,

236
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,760
Miss Fanny was looking for you.

237
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,420
She's here.

238
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,200
These flowers are from Mr. Wang.

239
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:04,800
Take them.

240
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,120
Bye.

241
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,600
Biying,

242
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,000
you're late again today.

243
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,640
Mom was just asking about you.

244
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,100
Luckily I covered for you.

245
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,880
Aren't you going to thank me?

246
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,240
Who's here?

247
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,320
Oh, Biying.

248
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,440
Miss Rachel.

249
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,960
Why are you so late today?

250
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,800
There's a gentleman over there.

251
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:29,880
Go check it out.

252
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,960
Sir.

253
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,680
Drinking alone,

254
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:39,610
isn't it boring?

255
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,080
Why don't

256
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,760
we have Miss Biying here

257
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,280
to keep you company?

258
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:44,760
Sure.

259
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,200
Enjoy your drinks.

260
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:51,920
Thank you.

261
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,180
Don't you want to have a drink with me?

262
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,010
Then I'll have one more drink with you.

263
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,680
Mr. Shen, please.

264
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:19,440
Please.

265
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,700
You're very beautiful, miss.

266
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:31,720
Thank you.

267
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,250
You're Miss Biying, right?

268
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,780
Which two characters?

269
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,880
Do you have a pen, sir?

270
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,520
Yes, I do.

271
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,600
These two characters...

272
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,850
They're beautiful.

273
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:10,640
Here.

274
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,360
Where are you from, Miss Biying?

275
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,440
From here.

276
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:24,860
This place.

277
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,440
Why so nervous?

278
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,960
Is it your first day at work?

279
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,200
You look unfamiliar.

280
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,000
Not at all.

281
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:33,860
I've been here for many years.

282
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,200
Actually, sir,

283
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,820
you're the one who looks unfamiliar.

284
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,090
I'll be coming to support you often in the future.

285
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,400
Excuse me,

286
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,760
I suddenly need to use the restroom.

287
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,280
Please.

288
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,160
Pardon me.

289
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:12,410
Mission accomplished.

290
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,290
Is this the pen with the intelligence?

291
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,480
Yes, it is.

292
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,359
Is the intelligence in numbers or...?

293
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:27,119
Miss Biying.

294
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,200
Let me introduce you.

295
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,640
He is your operation manager.

296
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,040
Muyilong.

297
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,120
Ye Biying.

298
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,680
Roses, roses,

299
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,440
so charming.

300
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,480
Roses.

301
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:55,680
Excuse me.

302
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,800
I'm not very good at dancing.

303
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,460
What I'm about to tell you,

304
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,200
you must remember

305
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,610
and promise not to tell anyone.

306
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,400
I could choose not to take you to the island.

307
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,490
Although taking you to the island is part of the plan,

308
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,400
it's more because

309
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,060
I don't want to see a young life

310
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,050
disappear from this world.

311
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,410
If you don't come with me to the island,

312
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,160
they will eliminate you

313
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,760
before you return to Chongqing.

314
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,520
How is that possible?

315
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,120
You shouldn't be surprised.

316
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,840
From the moment they recruited you,

317
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,900
they had already made up their minds.

318
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,200
After they eliminate you,

319
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,580
they'll stage a car accident,

320
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:38,530
an accident,

321
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,200
a facade you couldn't even imagine.

322
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,280
Why do you want to protect me?

323
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:45,400
Are you helping me?

324
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,770
I will take you safely to the island

325
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:49,260
and bring you back safely.

326
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,000
Who are you really?

327
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,050
I'm what you call a Japanese devil,

328
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,410
a Military Statistics Bureau dog spy.

329
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,560
If you really can't accept that,

330
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,520
you can also think of it as

331
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:04,920
me having inappropriate feelings for you.

332
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:06,050
You're not serious.

333
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,520
I don't want to dance with you anymore.

334
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,560
Wait.

335
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,560
If he won't dance with you,

336
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,920
I'll dance with you.

337
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,140
Let go of me.

338
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,780
How dare you hit me!

339
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,250
You'll pay for this.

340
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,920
Just wait.

341
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,240
Please have a drink.

342
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:34,560
Got it.

343
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,040
Is it good?

344
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:39,280
Boss.

345
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,690
There are suspicious individuals below.

346
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,860
We need to surface earlier than planned.

347
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:46,760
What?

348
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,220
Inoue Akira is right above us.

349
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,360
Let's go.

350
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,600
Everything before was just an act.

351
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,480
From now on,

352
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,680
our real mission begins.

353
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,480
Remember this.

354
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,360
Don't speak unnecessarily.

355
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,320
Don't make any sudden movements.

356
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,380
Follow my instructions completely.

357
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,200
What's going on?

358
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,530
Please give us a reasonable explanation.

359
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,810
Didn't you hear Mr. Inoue speaking to you?

360
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,880
Inoue Akira,

361
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,560
Toyama Mitsuru,

362
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:46,960
Uchida Ryohei,

363
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,200
Ogawa Unpei,

364
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,920
Sasaki Yasugorō,

365
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:53,280
are known as the five great leaders of Japanese ronin.

366
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,560
You're Japanese.

367
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,890
You can speak Japanese.

368
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,050
Miss Biying,

369
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,480
it's too noisy here.

370
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,880
Let's go somewhere else.

371
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:03,730
Let me go.

372
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,880
Sir.

373
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,040
Your identity is unclear,

374
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,040
you won't be leaving today.

375
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,400
What if I refuse to tell you?

376
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,600
Then we'll have to

377
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,860
ask you to come with us.

378
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,600
Mr. Inoue has a club

379
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,280
called Banzai on Huade Road.

380
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,520
He's bribed many Japanese patrolmen,

381
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,320
officers,

382
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,480
and veterans.

383
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,280
Specializing in bombings

384
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,800
and assassinations.

385
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,540
I really don't dare to go with you.

386
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,810
You seem to know quite a lot.

387
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,010
Take out what's in your pocket.

388
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:03,680
Takeki Ichiro,

389
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,720
Investigation Department of Emperor Showa's Chamber,

390
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,960
Colonel.

391
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,800
You're one of the Emperor's men.

392
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,600
A member of the Imperial Chamberlain's Office

393
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,480
not staying by the Emperor's side where you belong,

394
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:21,080
but coming here to visit prostitutes instead.

395
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,960
I've seen plenty of forged documents before.

396
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,520
But someone as bold as you

397
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,360
who dares to forge an attendant's identity

398
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,890
is the first I've ever seen.

399
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,320
I don't think you have the courage to open this letter.

400
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:40,540
Because you don't have the authority to open it.

401
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,680
Is that so?

402
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,560
Let go of this gentleman.

403
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,800
I was a bit rash just now.

404
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,200
Please forgive me.

405
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:35,200
Let's talk upstairs.

406
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,560
Of course, it's my treat.

407
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,760
I don't think that's necessary.

408
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,280
My woman has been frightened today,

409
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,330
and this man took advantage of her.

410
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,520
I think she needs to rest now.

411
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:47,920
You,

412
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,280
apologize to this lady.

413
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:53,840
I'm sorry.

414
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,160
Be more sincere.

415
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:58,880
I'm sorry.

416
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:05,160
Please forgive me.

417
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,920
Drink this glass of wine

418
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,920
and we'll forget what happened tonight.

419
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,960
Come, let's have a drink too.

420
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:55,840
I sincerely apologize, Colonel.

421
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,720
It's fine.

422
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:01,280
The investigator has just arrived in Shanghai.

423
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,920
Whatever you need Inoue to do,

424
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,700
please don't hesitate to ask.

425
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,400
Inoue is willing to utilize

426
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,280
all resources at my disposal

427
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,360
to serve you loyally

428
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,020
and make up for my disrespect.

429
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,060
How about this?

430
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,480
Tomorrow I will arrange

431
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,760
a banquet at Julehui,

432
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:18,200
Shanghai's finest hotel,

433
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,130
to apologize to the special envoy.

434
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,680
It's fine.

435
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,960
I'm only staying in Shanghai for one night.

436
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,160
That's a pity.

437
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,340
The special envoy comes and goes so quickly.

438
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,200
You must be handling

439
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,000
something important for His Majesty the Emperor.

440
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,120
Serving His Majesty the Emperor loyally

441
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,280
is my duty.

442
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,080
To be honest with you, Inoue,

443
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,520
tomorrow I'll be taking a ship

444
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,640
to a naval air base in the south.

445
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,720
That's no problem.

446
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,600
The special envoy must be

447
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,480
taking the Amemaru at 10 p.m. tomorrow night

448
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,800
to the Sixth Air Base on Sanzao Island, right?

449
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,720
After the banquet, I'll personally

450
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,640
escort you to your ship. How does that sound?

451
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,860
How did you know my itinerary?

452
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:08,480
Please don't be concerned.

453
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,960
My son serves in

454
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:16,220
the Special Police Unit at Sanzao Island's Sixth Air Base.

455
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,280
What a coincidence.

456
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,120
It's a pity.

457
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,960
I'm only staying in Shanghai for one night.

458
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,080
I haven't even notified

459
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,410
the Shanghai garrison.

460
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:24,810
Colonel.

461
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,720
Inoue will certainly invite you to the banquet.

462
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,360
After all,

463
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,320
the Inoue Mansion

464
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,680
is also the most famous civilian

465
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:38,280
intelligence agency of the Empire of Japan in Shanghai.

466
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:40,480
Colonel,

467
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,280
have a good time tonight.

468
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,000
Cheers.

469
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:02,240
Keep an eye on them and report to me immediately if anything happens.

470
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,280
Yes, sir.

471
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,450
What are you doing drunk like this?

472
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:18,880
Mr. Wumu.

473
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,140
We're being followed.

474
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,170
Give it back to them.

475
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,720
Why are you following me?

476
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,160
Bring the car over.

477
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,120
Yes, sir.

478
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,200
Be careful.

479
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,320
Wait for me here.

480
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:48,890
Take it easy.

481
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,760
Come in.

482
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,330
Wumu, you're

483
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,420
not drunk, are you?

484
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,840
Come in quickly.

485
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,800
This is the house where Miss Ye

486
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,200
and I stay in Shanghai.

487
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,780
You should rest first.

488
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,600
I need to take her

489
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:39,760
to get familiar with her room.

490
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,320
Okay.

491
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,280
Let's go.

492
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,440
This is your room.

493
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,640
Take a look around first.

494
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,370
Get familiar with everything.

495
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:05,840
Remember this.

496
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,040
6 Marshfield Road.

497
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:07,600
Yes.

498
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:10,740
Keep this safe.

499
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:12,640
These are your medical records

500
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,320
from Ruihua Hospital in Shanghai for last year and this year.

501
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,640
And also your purchase records

502
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,800
from the rice shop across the street.

503
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,530
Even the rice shop has records.

504
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:20,840
Where is it?

505
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,520
About 65 meters ahead.

506
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,360
Take us back to the Metropolitan Hotel.

507
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,280
Yes.

508
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:25,640
Reporting, sir.

509
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:32,040
What are you reporting for?

510
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,160
Master.

511
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,680
What master?

512
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:53,040
Fine.

513
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,400
Call me whatever you want.

514
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:59,120
Let me give you a nice kiss.

515
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,820
Let me tell you.

516
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,080
I've been away from this room

517
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,400
for 4 or 5 hours already.

518
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,400
They've installed bugs in the phone.

519
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,520
What you just said

520
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,280
might have already exposed us.

521
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,600
So as long as you're in this room,

522
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,520
you're not allowed to speak.

523
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,250
Understand?

524
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,720
Then what

525
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,520
should we do now?

526
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,640
Draw a bath for me

527
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,040
and join me for a bath.

528
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,720
Will you go first, or shall I?

529
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:36,120
Or should we bathe together?

530
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,200
Are you doing this on purpose or deliberately?

531
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:46,560
What commander?

532
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,120
What Japanese officer?

533
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:47,960
Are you out of your mind?

534
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:48,600
I'm not.

535
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,180
I just wanted to ask

536
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,120
why we have to live together.

537
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,760
Inoue Akira has already seen me.

538
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,120
Just now, someone was following us outside.

539
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,280
Someone from the Inoue residence.

540
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:57,360
Now our every move

541
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,020
is under their watchful eyes.

542
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,680
The Shanghai garrison's intelligence unit

543
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,080
will get the news immediately.

544
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,360
They will come here to visit me.

545
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,960
So you living here with me now

546
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,720
is our best option.

547
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,780
Do you understand?

548
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:12,840
I need to talk to you.

549
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,640
What about me?

550
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:16,020
Miss Ye.

551
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,280
Do you feel that living with me

552
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,610
is extremely awkward and uncomfortable?

553
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,530
Then I can responsibly tell you

554
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,080
that living with you

555
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:27,250
is even more awkward for me.

556
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,680
I'm more uncomfortable.

557
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,900
Do you understand?

558
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,480
I know you don't understand.

559
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,360
It's like casting pearls before swine.

560
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:37,820
Get out.

561
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,560
I won't.

562
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:41,560
I need to have a serious talk with you.

563
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,400
The master wants to take a bath now.

564
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,530
Do you want to watch?

565
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,720
What are you doing?

566
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,520
Taking a bath.

567
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,920
Have something to eat.

568
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,400
Okay.

569
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,160
Have a sweet potato.

570
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,840
It's so cold today.

571
00:33:58,720 --> 00:33:59,650
Where's the bug?

572
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,480
Just kidding.

573
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:07,780
Was that funny?

574
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,260
Not really appropriate for our line of work.

575
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:18,440
Just joking.

576
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,560
By the way, I want to know,

577
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,440
aren't you Japanese military?

578
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,500
So why are you also a Military Statistics Bureau agent?

579
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,920
I only knew we had traitors.

580
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,480
But you have them too?

581
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,920
What do you call them?

582
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,170
Japanese traitors?

583
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,620
Didn't your superior tell you

584
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,290
not to casually inquire about my affairs?

585
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:45,770
Fair enough.

586
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,480
You're still not coming out?

587
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:55,400
Take your time.

588
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,760
Is there a nightgown?

589
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,320
Is your cover identity a dancer?

590
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,880
Are our cover identities

591
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,210
supposed to be a couple?

592
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,600
I'm your superior.

593
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,000
I have the authority to give you orders.

594
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:34,580
Don't I?

595
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,040
So remember this.

596
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,320
If you can talk nicely in the future,

597
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,880
then don't get physical. Understand?

598
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,240
But I don't know anything about you.

599
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,200
How am I supposed to pretend to be your lover?

600
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,800
What do you mean you don't know?

601
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,640
You've seen my file,

602
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,600
I've seen yours too.

603
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,040
That counts as knowing each other.

604
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:46,840
Files are just files.

605
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,720
People are people.

606
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,680
People are alive.

607
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,280
Then what do you want to know?

608
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,320
For example.

609
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,000
Do you smoke?

610
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,180
Occasionally.

611
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,440
Are you married?

612
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,160
No, I'm not.

613
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,520
You don't look like someone who would be married.

614
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,840
What woman would want to marry you?

615
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,960
What about you? Are you married?

616
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:08,760
Of course not.

617
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:09,580
Be serious.

618
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,520
Didn't you want to know more?

619
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,800
Here's a book.

620
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,640
You can read English.

621
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,560
Read it as quickly as possible,

622
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:25,720
finish it,

623
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,720
and then tell me which passage interests you the most.

624
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:07,440
I'm still just a young girl.

625
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,600
I've never been in a relationship,

626
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:13,600
let alone slept with anyone.

627
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:16,680
My training

628
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:19,240
never included this either.

629
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,920
I know I can trust you

630
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,480
and I must trust you.

631
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,920
But no matter what,

632
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:26,600
I cannot share a bed with you.

633
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,840
Absolutely not.

634
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,480
I don't understand English

635
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,000
or anything at all.

636
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:44,640
Donkey.

637
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:47,320
How cute.

638
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Wumu.

639
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,000
I'm neither a stupid donkey

640
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,080
nor a foolish one.

641
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:07,320
I was born in the Year of the Ox,

642
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,760
not the Year of the Donkey.

643
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,680
Let me put it this way,

644
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,640
you're casting pearls before swine,

645
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,000
wasting your effort.

646
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,360
Please go to your own bed

647
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,080
and good night.

648
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,880
Oh my God!

649
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,200
He took two dancers

650
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:15,280
from the Guotai Ballroom.

651
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:15,880
One of them

652
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:17,360
was the woman we saw today.

653
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,360
Then he took those two dancers

654
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,960
to his residence.

655
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:23,360
I believe

656
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:24,840
the envoy's woman went back

657
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,960
to get some change of clothes.

658
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,040
Finally,

659
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,320
the envoy took that woman

660
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,400
to the Metropole Hotel.

661
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,960
Did they meet anyone special?

662
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,980
Nothing was observed.

663
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,040
Someone close to the Emperor,

664
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,560
coming to Shanghai,

665
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,520
can't help indulging in pleasure

666
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,040
and debauchery.

667
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,320
Yes.

668
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:50,760
What exactly is the envoy doing in Shanghai?

669
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:53,440
The envoy came to Shanghai

670
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,100
but doesn't seem to have any official business.

671
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,560
You may go now.

672
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,010
Connect me to the Garrison Headquarters.

673
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,440
This is Inoue Akira from the Inoue Mansion.

674
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:26,840
I'm looking for Chief of Staff Tangchuan Yafu.

675
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,560
Alright, one moment...

676
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,280
Very good.

677
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,440
Excellent.

678
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:35,320
Yes.

679
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:44,960
This is the first one.

680
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,220
Here's the second one.

681
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,280
I agree.

682
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,100
Major Channing Walker

683
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:52,680
graduated from Virginia Military Institute

684
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:55,820
joined the Army Air Force Intelligence in 1939.

685
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,120
Isn't that right?

686
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:57,650
Yes, sir.

687
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,240
Good.

688
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,400
Very good.

689
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,880
The Commander has a new assignment for you,

690
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,600
Major.

691
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,680
You are now officially appointed as

692
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:11,720
staff officer for Air Operations in the China Theater

693
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,040
and General Stilwell's air force assistant.

694
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:14,640
Yes, sir.

695
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,880
This is just your public identity.

696
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:17,840
Your real mission

697
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:18,720
Chief of Staff Harmon

698
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,280
will brief you immediately.

699
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,340
Listen, Channing.

700
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,720
What I'm about to tell you

701
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,840
is classified at the highest level.

702
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,040
Besides the people in this room

703
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,360
including the President of the United States,

704
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,960
you are the eleventh person to know about this.

705
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:35,880
In two weeks,

706
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,520
the Pacific Fleet with the Hornet

707
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,080
and Enterprise as the main vessels

708
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:42,120
will form a joint task force.

709
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,560
The fleet's mission

710
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,560
is to transport one of our bomber squadrons

711
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,090
across the entire Pacific.

712
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,200
It will take eighteen days.

713
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,640
The aircraft carriers will sail

714
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:54,000
to within 400 nautical miles of Japan.

715
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:55,680
Then,

716
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,760
our bomber squadron

717
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,560
led by Lieutenant Colonel Jimmy Doolittle

718
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:01,600
their mission is to take off from the ships

719
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,320
fly to Tokyo.

720
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,880
Execute bombing missions.

721
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:07,920
Bomb Tokyo?

722
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,040
Yes,

723
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,400
bomb Tokyo.

724
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,680
To avenge the attack

725
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,280
on Pearl Harbor.

726
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,700
Sir, how is that possible?

727
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,560
I've never heard of

728
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,200
Army bombers

729
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,840
taking off from Navy ships.

730
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,800
This is indeed unprecedented and extremely risky.

731
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,400
We want to send Japan a message

732
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:29,480
that their homeland is not safe.

733
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,260
Because the bombers cannot land on the deck,

734
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:35,420
after bombing Tokyo, the bombers must fly to China.

735
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:39,160
They will land at a small airfield in China

736
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,920
near Quzhou.

737
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,840
So Channing, your mission is

738
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,920
to ensure their safe return.

739
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:48,080
You need to arrive in China

740
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,880
before Doolittle

741
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,400
to ensure they can land safely.

742
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:56,840
Safe landing is the only guarantee

743
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,320
to prevent this mission from being suicidal.

744
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,040
The lives of the pilots

745
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,800
participating in this raid hang in the balance.

746
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:03,880
Do you understand the importance of this mission?

747
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:04,600
Yes, sir.

748
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:06,280
I will do my utmost

749
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:07,360
to ensure Doolittle and his pilots

750
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:08,560
return safely.

751
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:09,720
Sir,

752
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:14,160
the radio beacon call signs and codes

753
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,800
are all in this Bible.

754
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,800
You will use these to make contact with Doolittle.

755
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:19,920
We've installed a self-destruct mechanism in the book

756
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,520
you only need to pull it once.

757
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:25,360
There's also an intelligence capsule in here, Channing.

758
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,160
I don't need to explain further.

759
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,240
No need, sir.

760
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:31,960
Remember,

761
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:33,520
in the China Theater, only two people know about this

762
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,160
and can help you.

763
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,320
The Supreme Commander of the China Theater,

764
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,240
Chiang Kai-shek,

765
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,520
and General Stilwell, Chief of Staff of the China Theater.

766
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,520
Understood, sir.

767
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:41,770
I'll remember that.

768
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,040
You should be aware

769
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:46,280
that you're not our first Believer.

770
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:48,920
Your predecessor was shot down

771
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,980
while entering China through Burma.

772
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,520
He's still missing.

773
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:54,960
Yes, sir.

774
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:56,480
In two hours,

775
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,840
a plane will take you to India first,

776
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,900
then from India to General Stilwell.

777
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:02,240
Remember your soldier's oath.

778
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:04,680
Good luck.

779
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:05,640
Yes, sir.

780
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:06,850
I won't let you down.

781
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:09,880
God bless you.

782
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,320
Thank you, sir.

783
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:17,160
March 20, 1942.

784
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:18,960
The U.S. Army Department

785
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,920
sent the second Believer, Cheney,

786
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:26,120
to replace Witt who was trapped on Sanzao Island.
