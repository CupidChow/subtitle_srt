1
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,200
March 9, 1942.

2
00:01:57,479 --> 00:01:59,360
A mysterious Believer

3
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,220
was flown by special aircraft to the China Theater.

4
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,440
'Believer'

5
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,080
is a specialized term in the U.S. military

6
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:09,539
referring to someone who possesses top-secret information.

7
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,960
You must arrive

8
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,120
at Quzhou Airport in China before April 18

9
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,920
to receive the troops bombing Tokyo.

10
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,880
We can only risk sending you there.

11
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,760
The radio beacon you're carrying

12
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,020
must not be intercepted by the Japanese.

13
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,400
This operation concerns

14
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,680
the survival of our Pacific forces.

15
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,120
Sam,

16
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,320
this is Curtis.

17
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,880
Kate will arrive

18
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,079
at Yankee Point in ten minutes.

19
00:02:39,079 --> 00:02:40,360
I repeat.

20
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,640
Kate will arrive at Yankee Point in ten minutes.

21
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,920
Over.

22
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:47,880
Curtis,

23
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,680
this is Sam.

24
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,320
Copy that.

25
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:49,720
Say again.

26
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,240
Roger.

27
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,880
Over.

28
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:54,800
Sir,

29
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,040
Curtis is expected in 10 minutes

30
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,700
to arrive at Myanmar Airport.

31
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,240
Stay in touch.

32
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,160
Yes, sir.

33
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,680
Whiskey.

34
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,600
This is Curtis 663.

35
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,440
Request communication. Over.

36
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,440
Curtis.

37
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,400
This is Whiskey. Over.

38
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,600
This is Curtis.

39
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,560
Request permission to land.

40
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,020
I repeat, request permission to land. Over.

41
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,040
Curtis.

42
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,360
Permission to land granted. Over.

43
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,360
I repeat,

44
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,840
permission to land granted. Over.

45
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,800
These British fellows

46
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,840
are too hot to even speak properly.

47
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:43,960
Stop that aircraft!

48
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,920
Stop it now!

49
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,480
Pull up! Go around!

50
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,200
Shoot it down!

51
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,320
Pull up!

52
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,880
Pull up!

53
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,280
Sam, this is Curtis 663.

54
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,640
Yankee Point has fallen.

55
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,320
I repeat, Yankee Point has fallen.

56
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,240
Diverting to Mike Point, codename for Mandalay Airport.

57
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,080
Diverting to Mike Point.

58
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:53,440
Over.

59
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,400
How can there be

60
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,600
damn Japanese there?

61
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,040
Contact was normal just minutes ago.

62
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,360
Keep trying to contact them.

63
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,960
Keep an eye on that aircraft.

64
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:04,800
Major.

65
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,720
We've lost navigation.

66
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,320
Can we make it to the alternate airport?

67
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,440
We can only reduce altitude.

68
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,680
Look for ground navigation markers.

69
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,800
Stay alert.

70
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,680
Report our position to Sam at all times.

71
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,400
In fact,

72
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,080
the aircraft did have serious problems.

73
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,200
The bullet that hit the instrument panel

74
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,200
caused the compass to malfunction

75
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,480
and gave false airspeed readings.

76
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,640
While Wit Chen and his crew thought they were

77
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:43,400
diverting to Mandalay in the north,

78
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,360
they were actually flying northeast.

79
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,400
Mike,

80
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:49,440
this is Curtis 663 requesting communication.

81
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,000
Over.

82
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,240
Mike,

83
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,200
this is Curtis 663 requesting communication.

84
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:55,840
Over.

85
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,600
Sam,

86
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,920
this is Curtis 663 requesting communication.

87
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:09,250
Over.

88
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,640
This is Sam. Go ahead. Over.

89
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,680
I've reached the vicinity of Mike Point

90
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,410
but cannot establish contact.

91
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,040
Why are they shooting at us?

92
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,560
What's happening?

93
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,800
They probably mistook us

94
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,240
for Japanese aircraft.

95
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,159
Curtis is under fire.

96
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:33,159
I repeat,

97
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:34,520
Curtis is under fire.

98
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,440
Notify Mandalay Airport

99
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,170
that Curtis is approaching

100
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,330
and not to open fire.

101
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,560
Mike,

102
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,480
this is Sam.

103
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,520
Cease fire.

104
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:47,360
I repeat, cease fire.

105
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,320
Mike,

106
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,440
cease fire!

107
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,120
We are approaching.

108
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,080
Sir,

109
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,600
Mandalay Airport reports

110
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,960
no aircraft approaching

111
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,440
and their anti-aircraft units

112
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,000
haven't fired at any targets.

113
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,320
Where did they fly to?

114
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,120
This is not our position.

115
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,290
This is not McMandler Airport.

116
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,080
Get away from there.

117
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,600
Leave immediately.

118
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,800
I repeat, leave now.

119
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,770
You must evacuate the aircraft immediately.

120
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,880
Put on your parachutes.

121
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,600
You must jump now.

122
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,760
Stay safe and complete the mission.

123
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,640
Curtis.

124
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,480
This is Sam, do you copy?

125
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,440
Curtis.

126
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,080
This is Sam, do you copy?

127
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,169
Still can't reach the Colonel.

128
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,080
Contact Army Aviation Command.

129
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,720
We must report to General Arnold immediately.

130
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,480
Yes, sir.

131
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,480
The aircraft's last reported position

132
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,210
where was it?

133
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,600
The last coordinates were

134
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,800
113 degrees longitude, 28 degrees latitude.

135
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,200
Order the monitoring department

136
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,080
to closely monitor for 24 hours

137
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,360
all radio communications in this area.

138
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,040
Yes, sir.

139
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,360
Right, slow down.

140
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,800
At approximately 3:00 PM on March 10, 1942,

141
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,960
the 6th Air Base Air Defense Unit

142
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,320
shot down one American military transport aircraft,

143
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,080
killed two pilots,

144
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,480
and one navigator.

145
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,920
Special report.

146
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:32,880
Sir,

147
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,400
we've intercepted a radio transmission,

148
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,960
sent from the Japanese 6th Air Base

149
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,600
to the Command Headquarters in Taiwan.

150
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,570
Where is this base located?

151
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,860
In the Pearl River Delta region of China.

152
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,120
Get a team to decode it immediately. The sooner the better.

153
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,720
We are required within 24 hours

154
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,400
to determine the whereabouts of the aircraft.

155
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,200
Notify General Stilwell

156
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,280
and request assistance from the China Theater.

157
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,040
Yes, sir.

158
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,330
Who's there?

159
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,960
It's me, Commander.

160
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,560
A level 4A top-secret telegram

161
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,520
from the Burma Expeditionary Force.

162
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,240
Sent by the special communications unit of the Expeditionary Force.

163
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,040
Signed by General Stilwell.

164
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,660
Commander.

165
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,440
Rangoon Airport has fallen.

166
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,800
The Believer's aircraft couldn't land.

167
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,480
It diverted to an alternate airfield.

168
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,360
It disappeared at 113 degrees east longitude,

169
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,400
22 degrees north latitude.

170
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,720
The Believer is missing.

171
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,320
Yunong.

172
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,400
An American military aircraft has gone missing.

173
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:58,400
Look into it.

174
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:02,080
Yes.

175
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,640
Understood, Principal.

176
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,170
I'll send someone to investigate right away.

177
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,160
[Salutes]

178
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,000
Director.

179
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
[Salutes]

180
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,240
Director.

181
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,440
Director.

182
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,840
Director.

183
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,120
Director,

184
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:35,760
I'm back.

185
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,170
Another sleepless night, huh?

186
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,080
Director,

187
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,360
what's so urgent?

188
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,450
An American military aircraft

189
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,240
has disappeared near the Pearl River estuary.

190
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,410
The old man has given us 24 hours

191
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,800
to locate it

192
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,680
and determine the whereabouts

193
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,760
of the aircraft and its crew.

194
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:13,240
Attention!

195
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,280
At ease.

196
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,600
My name is Doolittle.

197
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,240
Welcome everyone.

198
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,080
In the next few weeks,

199
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,360
we'll be doing intensive training.

200
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,640
In the aircraft.

201
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:35,040
I know you're the best pilots we have,

202
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,920
you're our pride.

203
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,040
I hope you won't let me down.

204
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,080
Colonel,

205
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:43,520
can you tell us

206
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,050
what this mission is about?

207
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,880
No, at least not now.

208
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,560
All I can tell you is

209
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:54,080
this mission is dangerous.

210
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,920
It's your decision.

211
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,240
You can choose to quit right now.

212
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,560
No one will blame you.

213
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,840
I only want the best pilots,

214
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:12,120
ones who make our country proud.

215
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:20,480
There's nothing we can't accomplish.

216
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,560
Training begins now.

217
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,800
What's wrong?

218
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,460
Sir, there's a small problem.

219
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:46,320
What happened?

220
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,180
Whit Chen, your contact in China, has disappeared.

221
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:50,560
What?

222
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,570
Does this mission still need to continue?

223
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,480
Until President Roosevelt orders otherwise,

224
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,340
everything proceeds as planned.

225
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:08,280
So we're lambs to the slaughter.

226
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:08,840
No.

227
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,530
At least not yet.

228
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,520
Intelligence is handling this matter.

229
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,900
The General just wants you to focus on training.

230
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,800
Who does the General want to lead this team?

231
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,600
I don't know.

232
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,140
Why did you take this assignment?

233
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,560
Can you help me?

234
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,120
You need to discuss this with him,

235
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,760
friend.

236
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,700
Section Chief,

237
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,580
a telegram from U.S. Army Air Forces Intelligence.

238
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,090
This is a decrypted Japanese military telegram.

239
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,680
I'll go to the archives to check this location.

240
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,540
You report to the Director first.

241
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:13,970
Report, sir.

242
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,180
U.S. intelligence

243
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,600
intercepted a message from Japan's Sixth Air Base

244
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,320
sent to Taiwan Headquarters.

245
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,960
It confirms that a few hours ago,

246
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,880
over Sanzao Island in Zhongshan County, Guangdong,

247
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:31,480
Japanese forces shot down an Allied aircraft.

248
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,760
Two pilots were killed,

249
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:34,220
along with one navigator.

250
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,280
Sanzao.

251
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,440
The telegram only mentions

252
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,840
that they killed the pilots and navigator.

253
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,840
Is there no news about a fourth person on the plane?

254
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,580
No news about a fourth person.

255
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,320
Does Section Chief Shen know?

256
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,980
Director Shen knows about it.

257
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,400
He's gone to the archives

258
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,340
to find detailed information on Sanzao Island.

259
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,960
Contact the Fourth War Zone.

260
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,560
Use all available resources

261
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,800
to find out everything about

262
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,760
this aircraft.

263
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,240
We must locate the fourth person.

264
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:15,800
Yes.

265
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,240
An'er.

266
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,160
Last night

267
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,280
our anti-aircraft artillery unit

268
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:36,280
shot down an American plane.

269
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,020
Can you believe

270
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,440
he dared to salvage items from the plane on his own?

271
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,040
That's nonsense!

272
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,760
My An is absolutely not a thief.

273
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,520
I saw him salvaging with my own eyes.

274
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,620
He was just catching seafood.

275
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,760
You bunch of robbers

276
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,080
won't even let us eat our fill.

277
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,360
Do those things in the sea

278
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,200
belong to you too?

279
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:01,920
Yes,

280
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,320
everything in the sea belongs to us.

281
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:08,240
Every breath of air you take

282
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,440
belongs to us too.

283
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,570
I've said it:

284
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,160
he's a thief,

285
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,320
so that's what he is.

286
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,160
You!

287
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,360
Chairman Tang.

288
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,000
Listen,

289
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,000
with this attitude of yours,

290
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,600
forget about the ancestral ceremony today.

291
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:28,480
The main officiant has arrived.

292
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:44,720
Mr. Ye,

293
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,320
hello.

294
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,210
This is the ancestral hall,

295
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,340
a place to worship our ancestors.

296
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:01,160
Xia'er.

297
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,280
[Light the incense]

298
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,600
[Bestow blessings]

299
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,200
[Pour libation and bow three times]

300
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,120
[Rise and return to your places]

301
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,160
Clan Chief.

302
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,160
Proceed

303
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,240
with the secondary offering.

304
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,170
[Before the incense altar]

305
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,480
[Kneel]

306
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,520
[Ceremony complete]

307
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,700
Fellow villagers,

308
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,440
ancestor worship

309
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,530
is meant to honor the ancestral order,

310
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,040
revere virtue,

311
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,320
respect the elderly and the worthy,

312
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,930
and maintain clan harmony through remembrance.

313
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,000
The ancient kings established rituals

314
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,200
to teach people to honor their origins.

315
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,520
Without ancestors, there would be no parents.

316
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:41,840
Without parents, there would be no self.

317
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,760
Ancestor worship teaches us about our roots.

318
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,800
A person without humanity

319
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,320
is no different from beasts.

320
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,440
Wait a moment.

321
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,680
Don't think I don't understand

322
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,360
what you're saying, old man.

323
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,040
It seems these past two years

324
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,160
you've been living too comfortably.

325
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,240
It's time to remind you

326
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,280
whose territory this really is.

327
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:15,360
I declare

328
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,080
immediate execution for

329
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:19,240
this thief.

330
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:19,920
Wait.

331
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,880
The nation has its laws,

332
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,340
and the clan has its rules.

333
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,010
Since we're holding trial in the ancestral hall,

334
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,450
then it's only right

335
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,490
that the people of Sanzao Island handle this matter.

336
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:33,880
Very well.

337
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,370
How do you propose to handle it?

338
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,000
Long Xia,

339
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,170
family punishment.

340
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,040
Hand.

341
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,880
I don't have any.

342
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,280
Mr. Ye,

343
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,000
your family punishment

344
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,600
is too lenient.

345
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,480
Long Xia,

346
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,640
bring the whip.

347
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,840
An'er.

348
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,920
Stop beating him. Something bad will happen if you continue.

349
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,880
Let's stop here then.

350
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:27,480
Fine.

351
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,880
You may continue.

352
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,280
Retreat.

353
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,600
Jingshang.

354
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,920
Aren't you going back to your unit?

355
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:38,680
No.

356
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:41,400
The plane crashed near this village.

357
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,040
This village needs to be thoroughly searched.

358
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,480
Everyone get out of my way!

359
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,920
You saved our lives!

360
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:55,000
Mr. Ye is truly our family's savior.

361
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,160
Quickly, carry him back.

362
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,330
Get him treated.

363
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,890
Everyone disperse now.

364
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,200
Have all the villagers left?

365
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,080
Have they all gone?

366
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:24,240
Everyone, stay alert.

367
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,440
Search this village thoroughly.

368
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,280
Look for anything suspicious.

369
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,360
Understood?

370
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:33,160
Turn left!

371
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,960
Forward, march!

372
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,360
Sir.

373
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:57,800
Sipo.

374
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,000
Something terrible has happened.

375
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,600
What is it?

376
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,280
I was with Idiot on the beach

377
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,760
when we saved an American.

378
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,840
Nobody move!

379
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,570
Don't shoot!

380
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,920
We're just civilians.

381
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,040
Sir,

382
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,960
we haven't done anything.

383
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:16,960
Run!

384
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,720
Don't go!

385
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:23,850
You're not Japanese soldiers.

386
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,000
No,

387
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,400
I'm American.

388
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,080
Hurry up.

389
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,560
Where is it?

390
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,840
At my home.

391
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,080
Relax.

392
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,360
I know what you're thinking.

393
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,560
Why do I speak English?

394
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:57,200
Right?

395
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,400
I was once a consul in the United States.

396
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,200
Where in America?

397
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,280
Honolulu, Hawaii.

398
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,760
Where is this place?

399
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,480
Sanzao Island.

400
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,280
The Japanese call it the Sixth Air Base.

401
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:24,320
Please tell me

402
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,000
how can I get out of here?

403
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:27,800
Young man,

404
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,480
this is a place

405
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,000
no one can enter

406
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,600
and no one can leave.

407
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,280
What did you say?

408
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,400
Can you tell me

409
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,480
who you are?

410
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,520
I'm an aviation advisor

411
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,880
to General Stilwell in the China Theater.

412
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,680
I'm Chinese American.

413
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,440
My ancestors immigrated to America.

414
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,560
Sir,

415
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:03,000
I'm just a professional soldier.

416
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,720
Of course,

417
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,160
I don't think

418
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,760
it's unrelated to my skin color and ethnicity.

419
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:09,840
However,

420
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:13,240
my superiors chose me for this mission.

421
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:18,800
Perhaps they had this in mind.

422
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,360
Do you speak Chinese?

423
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,280
If you want to stay alive,

424
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,730
start reviewing your Chinese.

425
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:31,560
Can you tell me

426
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,480
what I can do for you?

427
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,690
Please help me notify the Chinese government

428
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,480
that I'm stranded here.

429
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,200
I've already told you.

430
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,640
This island

431
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,560
has been occupied by the Japanese for three years.

432
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:48,960
It's tightly blockaded.

433
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,720
No one can come or go freely.

434
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,610
Don't shoot.

435
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,160
If you fire that gun,

436
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,560
we're all dead.

437
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:10,360
Ma'am.

438
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,040
Where can we hide him?

439
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,080
Under this bed.

440
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,080
Hide under there first

441
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,240
and bear with it for a while.

442
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,080
Tonight,

443
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,760
I'll take you to our home.

444
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,400
All right.

445
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,440
Xia'er.

446
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:33,560
I'm here.

447
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,020
Xia'er.

448
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:35,640
Come.

449
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,920
Quickly deliver this to your uncle.

450
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,440
Tell him to notify Wu Fazi as soon as possible.

451
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,440
What's so urgent?

452
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,200
Your fourth aunt saved an American.

453
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,800
An American?

454
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,160
Seems important.

455
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:53,560
Hurry up

456
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,480
and deliver it.

457
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:17,560
Director.

458
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,880
We've received a telegram from the Fourth War Zone.

459
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,810
Read it quickly.

460
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,200
We've obtained intelligence from Sanzao Island.

461
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,040
An Allied aircraft

462
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,900
was shot down over Sanzao Island.

463
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:30,880
There's someone who claims to be

464
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,160
Stilwell's aviation staff officer.

465
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:32,840
He was severely injured when parachuting

466
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,240
and was rescued by Sanzao Island fishermen

467
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,560
who are hiding him in their home.

468
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:39,200
He successfully escaped by parachute. Unfortunately,

469
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,880
he's trapped on an isolated island fully occupied by Japanese forces.

470
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,880
Our rescue operation is now being urgently deployed.

471
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,080
Do they understand

472
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,540
how important this man is?

473
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,920
He absolutely cannot fall into Japanese hands.

474
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:52,880
Yes.

475
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,640
They understand the significance of this matter.

476
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,720
If they fail to rescue him,

477
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,600
China will send someone to eliminate him,

478
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:04,760
ensuring he won't fall into Japanese hands.

479
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:09,380
Yunong.

480
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,480
I know.

481
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,800
You have an action team in Tokyo, Japan

482
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,140
that has never been deployed, right?

483
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:18,920
Principal.

484
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,360
Activate your team in Tokyo.

485
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,040
It's time now.

486
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,400
Broadcast this.

487
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,040
Wait for my call

488
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,400
before stopping.

489
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,400
4:50

490
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,840
5:50

491
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,000
6:50

492
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,320
8:50

493
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,240
Each to be broadcast three times.

494
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:40,920
Yes.

495
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,800
China Central News Agency.

496
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:52,160
It's now time for the missing persons broadcast.

497
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,760
Mr. Liao Zhi.

498
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,800
Mr. Liao Zhi.

499
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:58,960
Ms. He Fangfang.

500
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,280
Ms. He Fangfang.

501
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,120
After the fall of Nanjing,

502
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,520
your father, Liao Yuanda,

503
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,600
has arrived in Chongqing.

504
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,440
He now lives on Shancheng Street,

505
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:13,920
Yi Hutong, Number 6.

506
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,480
He hopes to hear from you.

507
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,920
Let's repeat that.

508
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:26,080
It's time for the missing persons broadcast.

509
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:30,280
Mr. Liao Zhi.

510
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,680
Ms. He Fangfang.

511
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,260
Familiarize yourself with this.

512
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:48,840
You can only use your memory.

513
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:50,570
Don't leave any written notes.

514
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,080
No problem.

515
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,000
Wu Muyilang.

516
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:56,720
That's him.

517
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,120
This Wu Muyilang

518
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,640
was born in 1912,

519
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,000
code name 'Lumberjack'.

520
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,970
He's from Minqing, Fujian.

521
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,480
His father Lin Yuanda

522
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,320
in his early years

523
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,440
He was a merchant selling mining equipment.

524
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,240
When he was six years old,

525
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,840
his father went to Japan

526
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:22,280
to transport goods by ship,

527
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:25,340
but died when his ship sank in a storm in the Sea of Japan.

528
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,920
With no other choice, his mother

529
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,400
took him, at the age of six,

530
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,520
and remarried

531
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:34,200
his father's close friend, Takeki Kafu.

532
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:37,840
Lin Sen then changed his name to Takeki Ichiro.

533
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,290
This person's character is

534
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,720
loyal and brave,

535
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,680
calm and composed,

536
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,160
unflappable,

537
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,040
analytical,

538
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,080
stable and low-profile,

539
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,720
and handles situations with composure.

540
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,920
Currently serves in the Japanese Royal

00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:00,800
Guard Office as an investigator in the Investigation Department,

542
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,200
with the rank of Colonel.

543
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,920
The higher-ups have been suspicious for some time.

544
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,520
They say within the Special Higher Police

545
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,120
and within the Military Police

546
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,719
there are Communist agents.

547
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,580
Are you one of them?

548
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:16,239
Yes.

549
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:34,719
Takahashi Nobuo:

550
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,040
treason,

551
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,440
resisted arrest,

552
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:38,320
shot dead.

553
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,159
Director,

554
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,239
you're truly remarkable.

555
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:54,600
Takegi Ichiro

556
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,840
graduated from

557
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,960
the Military Academy.

558
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,760
After graduation,

559
00:34:58,760 --> 00:34:59,880
with excellent grades,

560
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:02,600
he earned a government scholarship.

561
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,000
In 1930,

562
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,520
he was sent to Shanghai, China

563
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:09,250
to study at the East Asia Common Culture Academy.

564
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:31,720
Uphold Peace, Oppose War.

565
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,560
Uphold peace.

566
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,800
What are you doing?

567
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,610
What's going on?

568
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,480
What gives you the right to hit people?

569
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,920
In all the intelligence files of the Military Statistics Bureau,

570
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,960
what was never recorded was

571
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:51,440
that after the arrest at Tongwen Academy,

572
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,800
the shrewd and steady Wu Muyilang

573
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:56,600
immediately changed his inexperienced

574
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,000
and strategically ineffective fighting methods.

575
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,360
Soon, together with his classmate Chixi Longze,

576
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,320
through their teacher at Tongwen Academy,

577
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,080
a secret Communist Party member and economics professor

578
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,000
Wang Yanwu's introduction,

579
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,120
they met

580
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:13,200
the CPC representative Pan stationed in Shanghai,

581
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,360
and under his guidance,

582
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:18,200
they joined the Communist Party of China.

583
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,160
Lin Sen.

584
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:28,720
It's time for the missing persons broadcast.

585
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:33,320
Mr. Liao Zhi

586
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:38,240
Ms. He Fangfang

587
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,320
After the fall of Nanjing,

588
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,640
your father Liao Yuanda

589
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,680
has arrived in Chongqing

590
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,800
He currently lives on Shancheng Street,

591
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,040
Yi Alley, Number 6,

592
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,960
hoping to hear from you.

593
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,380
Mother, I'm going out for a while.

594
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,560
Come back for dinner.

595
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:06,880
I got it.

596
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,160
An engineer from Komatsu Manufacturing

597
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,520
lives in a nice place.

598
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,560
Please come in, Mr. Takeki.

599
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,560
After the Pearl Harbor attack,

600
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,480
I thought you would come to see me soon.

601
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,920
But unexpectedly,

602
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,920
I waited for you for nearly 100 days.

603
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:00,720
Their attack on Pearl Harbor

604
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,120
has nothing to do with me.

605
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,000
How about you?

606
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,040
How have you been

607
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:06,840
doing?

608
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:14,720
Everything was fine before you came.

609
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,640
The war between China and Japan

610
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,840
has been going on for more than a decade.

611
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,360
Now we're at war with America too.

612
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,480
The entire Southeast Asia is now engulfed in conflict.

613
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,210
It seems only Tokyo remains untouched by the war.

614
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,160
We

615
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,480
seem to have been forgotten

616
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:39,560
by both our enemies

617
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,760
and our friends.

618
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,360
Are you coming or not?

619
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,840
It's no fun if you don't want to come see me.

620
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,160
After 1937,

621
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,320
I never used it again.

622
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,000
But I maintained it every week,

623
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,520
just for today,

624
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,960
waiting for you to come.

625
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,640
Get ready to transmit.

626
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:41,120
Okay.

627
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,680
Mr. Chen Qiao.

628
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,320
Mr. Chen Qiao.

629
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,640
Mr. Chen Qiao.

630
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,080
Mr. Chen Qiao,

631
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:17,920
sorry to disturb you.

632
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,800
Why did it take so long to answer the door?

633
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,640
I'm sorry,

634
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:21,720
I was in the bathroom.

635
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,850
What can I do for you?

636
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,280
The 101st Division

637
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,080
has issued recruitment orders.

638
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,500
The recruitment focus

639
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,240
is in this area.

640
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,000
Mr. Ida was sent by the higher-ups

641
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,400
specifically to handle this recruitment.

642
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,560
You are

643
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,200
Chen Qiao from Jiechuan?

644
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,000
Yes.

645
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,000
38 years old?

646
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:43,640
Yes.

647
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:48,740
Please show me your identification.

648
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:53,700
Just a moment, please.

649
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,000
Mr. Chen Qiao,

650
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,200
he's not within our recruitment scope.

651
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,200
Sir.

652
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,320
Mr. Chen studied engineering.

653
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,040
I'm an engineer at Komatsu Manufacturing.

654
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,320
He's a tank engine designer.

655
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:28,560
Yes.

656
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,200
That's impressive.

657
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,720
Excuse me.

658
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,400
Sorry to disturb you.

659
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:36,720
Mr. Chen Qiao

660
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,920
is not within our current recruitment scope.

661
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:39,760
Is that so?

662
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,720
Thank you for your trouble.

663
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,760
Sorry for the disturbance.

664
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,880
We'll be going now.

665
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:55,440
Mr. Chen Qiao,

666
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,520
are you

667
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,680
alone in this house?

668
00:41:58,680 --> 00:41:59,520
Yes, just me.

669
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:06,680
Sir,

670
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,200
please wait.

671
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,280
This is a private residence.

672
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,680
Jintian.

673
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,760
Sir, wait.
