1
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,720
I need to talk to the captain.

2
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,680
This is Akino.

3
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,360
Commander wants to know

4
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,759
Lord Investigator has been

5
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:54,680
has been going to the base hospital.

6
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,160
Why?

7
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:56,960
Yes.

8
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,800
Mr. Sakamoto.

9
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,640
In the last battle,

10
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,080
our injured soldiers

11
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,840
To console them,

12
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,520
the canteen of the garrison

13
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,580
according to the standard of pilots,

14
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,020
according to the standard of pilots.

15
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,170
That's why he went to the hospital.

16
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,240
I see.

17
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,400
Did you find anything else?

18
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,040
No.

19
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,120
Okay. Okay.

20
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,320
Okay. Okay.

21
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,880
Thank you. Thank you.

22
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,000
Thank you.

23
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,700
Transfer me to the base hospital.

24
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,320
Come in.

25
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:53,600
Habha.

26
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,780
I've basically found out.

27
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,000
Why did he go to the hospital?

28
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,360
Since Huangyang Mountain was attacked,

29
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:01,960
the colonel

30
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:04,220
feel guilty for those wounded soldiers.

31
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:04,960
So I go to the base hospital every day.

32
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,160
to visit the injured.

33
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,560
Right.

34
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:11,240
What else?

35
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,250
According to the report from Akinowa,

36
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:14,920
Today,

37
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,050
Colonel only went to the base hospital

38
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,200
to visit the injured.

39
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,040
and paid for it.

40
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,320
The cafeteria of the garrison

41
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,200
according to the standard of pilots,

42
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,260
according to the standard of pilots.

43
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,960
According to the close soldier,

44
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:34,840
he personally

45
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,680
to the wounded.

46
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,760
Okay.

47
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,720
I don't think

48
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,680
to report to me

49
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,400
you came to report to me, right?

50
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,000
I dare not.

51
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,520
I checked with the hospital.

52
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:51,760
They said

53
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,690
It's the same as what Akinowa said.

54
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,200
I see.

55
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,160
Colonel is

56
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,320
very thoughtful.

57
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,160
But he's also very smart.

58
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,800
He doesn't want you to know.

59
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,240
I guess neither you nor Oshima Hao

60
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:06,970
can find out.

61
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,520
Arrange it.

62
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,480
We'll go to Hengqin Island to inspect in two days.

63
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,880
Yes, sir. I'll get ready.

64
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,040
You're back.

65
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,170
You must be waiting.

66
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,400
It's a good thing.

67
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:00,880
A bad thing.

68
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,810
Which one first?

69
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,200
Bad news.

70
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,120
What is it?

71
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,200
I just came back from Fujita.

72
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,920
I had a fight with Oshima Hao there.

73
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,250
We broke up completely.

74
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,280
There's good news.

75
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,320
The clue of death on the well

76
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,720
is completely dead here.

77
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,280
No.

78
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,280
Oshima Ho won’t let it go.

79
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,760
I’m his superior officer.

80
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,240
Without solid evidence,

81
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,320
What can he do to me?

82
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,640
It's okay.

83
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,720
By the way,

84
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,130
go to your house now.

85
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,360
to remind your family

86
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,200
In case Oshima Hao

87
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,530
will jump into the wall.

88
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,400
Let's go.

89
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,159
Wait.

90
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,240
What are you doing?

91
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,500
What are you thinking?

92
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,720
There's something on your head.

93
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,080
What now?

94
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:01,960
Someone

95
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,160
came here twice.

96
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:03,840
You know?

97
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,280
The emptiness behind us

98
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,040
They all know

99
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,200
When I'm not around,

100
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,680
when I'm not around.

101
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,760
Then I can move in.

102
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,480
Right?

103
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,560
Are you coming?

104
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,640
Drop it.

105
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,040
Again.

106
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,650
One, two, three.

107
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,280
Captain.

108
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,159
He’s here.

109
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:55,800
Captain.

110
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,640
He's here.

111
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,040
Again.

112
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:00,760
Ready.

113
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,600
One, two, three.

114
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,240
Captain.

115
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,560
You were on duty

116
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,560
at the gate of the base hospital.

117
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:16,600
Yes.

118
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,320
Captain.

119
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,760
Have you seen Irigami?

120
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,240
Yes.

121
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,410
I saw him leave with my own eyes.

122
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,000
He left the hospital.

123
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,960
and left on his motorcycle.

124
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:26,960
Is that so?

125
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:27,760
Yes.

126
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,360
So you didn't see his face.

127
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,880
You just left

128
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,919
with this man.

129
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,240
and then confirmed that he was Urigami.

130
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:34,919
Is that so?

131
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,080
I didn't see it.

132
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:42,919
But besides Captain Irigami,

133
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,400
who else can ride his motorcycle?

134
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,020
I want to know that too.

135
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,210
Did you find anything else?

136
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,840
Nothing else.

137
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:57,400
But...

138
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:58,960
Just what?

139
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,500
On the day I was on duty,

140
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,360
a nurse from the hospital

141
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,220
pushed a patient in from outside.

142
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,220
I think they were taking the wounded out.

143
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,200
But I didn't see them go out.

144
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:12,800
Nurse!

145
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,640
The patient.

146
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,000
Do you remember him?

147
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,000
I think so.

148
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,120
nursing private

149
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,560
Nurse Tang Ju Er.

150
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,960
There aren't many Chinese nurses in the hospital.

151
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,040
So I remember.

152
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,000
You may leave.

153
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,360
Goodbye.

154
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,400
What do you think is wrong?

155
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,640
So,

156
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,360
there is no 100% proof that

157
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,160
the one who rode the motorbike was Irigami.

158
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,600
That nurse must be hiding something.

159
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,000
I'm not sure.

160
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,720
Where else can we start?

161
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,610
If the base hospital

162
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,840
is the first scene,

163
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,800
Then at the base hospital,

164
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,530
there must be other witnesses.

165
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,840
If

166
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,680
keep investigating,

167
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,520
Colonel is a stumbling block.

168
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,000
Commander Fujita might find out.

169
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:21,280
if he finds out.

170
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,320
Yes.

171
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,720
Let's try something else.

172
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,930
I won't check the hospital.

173
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,250
I won't let him get in my way.

174
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:37,480
Gather everyone.

175
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,680
Let's have a meeting.

176
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,360
Arrange two people

177
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,080
to the base hospital.

178
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:42,840
Okay.

179
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:47,720
Go ahead.

180
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,400
Oshima Hao

181
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,600
didn't notice the room Major was in.

182
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,080
I can only

183
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:56,920
all their attention

184
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,960
to me.

185
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,560
If they

186
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,720
pay attention to the military hospital,

187
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,280
we'll conduct a thorough investigation.

188
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,610
The Major won't be far from being exposed.

189
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,200
Dad and Takemichi

190
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,480
are quite close.

191
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,800
What are they talking about?

192
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,080
Let's talk about something.

193
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,540
Are they talking about your wedding?

194
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,720
About your dowry?

195
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,320
It hurts.

196
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,600
Relax.

197
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,400
I got a message.

198
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:38,960
Go.

199
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,840
There's news.

200
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,260
This should be for you.

201
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,680
Bik-ying, do me a favor.

202
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,410
Go to the car.

203
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:09,600
Thank you.

204
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,730
What's that?

205
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:28,420
People outside

206
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,600
urged us to leave the island as soon as possible.

207
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,480
If we can use the sea ban this time,

208
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,080
we can use this opportunity.

209
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,240
to lift the sea ban.

210
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,540
Isn't this too dangerous?

211
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,380
Indeed.

212
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,360
I need to think about it.

213
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,600
Yesterday we received

214
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,200
from Xia’s uncle yesterday.

215
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,320
He asked us to reply to him as soon as possible.

216
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,840
But in my heart,

217
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,160
lifting the sea ban

218
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,480
to lift the sea ban.

219
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:54,760
So,

220
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,040
I have to wait

221
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,040
a certain message

222
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,080
to him.

223
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:01,280
Let's wait and see.

224
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,600
If I have accurate information,

225
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,320
we'll make the next arrangement.

226
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,520
That's good.

227
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,200
I’ll go to the base hospital

228
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,680
to the base hospital tomorrow.

229
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,140
Tell the Major about this.

230
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,720
The telegram from Tokyo Police Agency

231
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,280
I sent it.

232
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,560
Captain Irigami is dead.

233
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,080
This case

234
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,280
into a dead end again.

235
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,040
What do you think?

236
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,640
I think

237
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,280
It seems that Colonel Takemichi

238
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,320
seems to lack a clear motive.

239
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,400
I think so too.

240
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,920
We can't rule out the deputy captain of the well.

241
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:01,720
got drunk

242
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,040
and got into an accident.

243
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:08,720
How naive.

244
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,680
What are you talking about?

245
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,920
Are you showing respect to the dead?

246
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:19,640
I don't want to hear

247
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,400
from you.

248
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:22,800
Forget it.

249
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,600
I have other ways.

250
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,200
Get more people in for a meeting.

251
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,760
Call the captain of each unit in.

252
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,560
Report!

253
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,320
Come in.

254
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,760
Airport defence team high-shot squadron

255
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,080
How many people are here?

256
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,880
requested Captain Matsumoto to be investigated.

257
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,240
Captain Matsumoto of Team 3.

258
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,680
The investigator wants you to go to the garrison.

259
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,810
to be investigated.

260
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,080
Why?

261
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,120
Captain Matsumoto was in charge of

262
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,980
before the Horn General took off,

263
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,720
The last squad of guards.

264
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,000
Colonel Takemuki.

265
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,280
There are many things

266
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,980
to ask Captain Matsumoto.

267
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,720
Sorry.

268
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:45,960
Takemici.

269
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,360
I haven't taken my stuff.

270
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,700
Let's pack it up and move in tomorrow.

271
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:52,200
Okay.

272
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,840
If you want us to take off now,

273
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,400
it's not ready yet.

274
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,880
Sir, this one will be fixed soon.

275
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:15,920
We have to

276
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,580
on the work record yesterday.

277
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,240
Sir.

278
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,920
Captain Michell said

279
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,360
The dinner for the revival festival is in the military office.

280
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,200
Ready.

281
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,200
Tell the captain

282
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:24,880
I have half of my flight

283
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,760
I haven't finished yet.

284
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,280
I'm not here for a picnic.

285
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,400
It's the officer.

286
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,080
Lieutenant.

287
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,080
It's the captain.

288
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,200
Thank you, captain.

289
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,840
It's the captain.

290
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,560
I think I found it.

291
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,320
It's almost out.

292
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:38,840
Yes.

293
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:39,680
I saw it.

294
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,600
Dude.

295
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,640
What model is this plane?

296
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,880
This is a stray cat fighter.

297
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,760
The glory of the American Navy.

298
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,080
I don't know.

299
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,240
sailors can fly plane at will.

300
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,280
I think this is the job of a pilot.

301
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,840
How many times did it fight?

302
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,640
A Japanese zero-style fighter.

303
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,880
When you guys fly up,

304
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,079
the entire air force in Japan

305
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,000
in a minute.

306
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:08,800
Marines!

307
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,640
You're quite talkative.

308
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,240
I know you used to

309
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,569
with these small tools.

310
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,880
Put these down.

311
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,880
Obviously, you haven't told me

312
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,640
your girlfriend in red dress that night.

313
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,079
It's done.

314
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,000
Dawen Potter

315
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,720
Let's go.

316
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,400
I don't think they want us

317
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,930
to disturb their extracurricular practice.

318
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,250
Let's go.

319
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,200
Sergeant.

320
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,800
You just let him go?

321
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,360
I was going to

322
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,490
a bruise on his face.

323
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,160
Whether you like it or not,

324
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:37,760
Captain said

325
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:38,880
to get along with them.

326
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,400
Okay?

327
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,480
Okay.

328
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,360
Nurse Tang.

329
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:26,080
What are you looking for?

330
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,740
You're more careful than before.

331
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:32,960
I still feel uneasy.

332
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,160
I've been having nightmares lately.

333
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,120
I feel like

334
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,160
something will happen.

335
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,800
I had a nightmare because of you.

336
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,600
I was too nervous during the day.

337
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,690
It's normal.

338
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,740
I have nightmares too.

339
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,880
Don't think too much.

340
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,480
Take your medicine.

341
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,080
Here.

342
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,640
Captain Sasaki, I told you

343
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,920
Nurse Tang is busy.

344
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:02,880
How about I arrange

345
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,760
another doctor?

346
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,560
No need.

347
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,640
Our captain called Nurse Tang Ju Er.

348
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,520
Take her away.

349
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,050
Yes, sir!

350
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,200
Captain.

351
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,720
Tang Ju is here.

352
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,160
Tang Ju.

353
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,840
You'll be fine.

354
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,480
Wrong movement.

355
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:14,960
Keep going.

356
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,760
Attention.

357
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,760
Ready.

358
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,320
Action.

359
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,560
Action.

360
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,120
Again.

361
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,800
Ready.

362
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,040
Action.

363
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,450
Why did you call me here?

364
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,720
You're a nurse.

365
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:10,960
Show them.

366
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,040
See if it's okay.

367
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,040
Take a rest.

368
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,120
Check the wound.

369
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:49,720
Captain Akino.

370
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,160
Yes?

371
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,320
Wait here.

372
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:52,480
Yes.

373
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,320
Nurse Tang was taken away

374
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,280
by the police.

375
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,210
What's going on?

376
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,480
I don't understand what they're saying.

377
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,880
But I don't feel good.

378
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,260
Looks like Ikegami Kamakura's death

379
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,200
Oshima Hao

380
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,460
pay attention to this.

381
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,320
What I'm worried about now is

382
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,280
if Oshima Hao

383
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,280
little tricks,

384
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,760
Tang Ju can't handle it.

385
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,160
Then his next target

386
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,240
will be you.

387
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:34,240
It's not safe here.

388
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,180
I'm here to tell you

389
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,200
I heard that

390
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:40,720
they want us

391
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,040
to lift the sea ban

392
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:43,560
to transfer you out successfully.

393
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,160
It seems

394
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,640
it'll be too late.

395
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,580
What should we do next?

396
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,980
I'll take you away in two days.

397
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,640
Go away.

398
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,000
Look at my wound!

399
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,720
Captain Akino!

400
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,040
I order you.

401
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,200
From now on,

402
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,000
send someone to work at the base hospital.

403
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,800
Guard the ward of the second-class soldier.

404
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,480
Take turns to shift 24 hours a day.

405
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,080
No one is allowed to approach him.

406
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:32,840
This is it.

407
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,920
The villagers broke the letter?

408
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,120
He's a very important witness

409
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,120
of the Daewongdae's fall accident.

410
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,480
So you must promise His Majesty

411
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,160
nothing will go wrong.

412
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,880
No one

413
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,480
to talk to him in his ward.

414
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,140
You must follow this order strictly.

415
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,480
Make sure he's safe.

416
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,080
Make sure nothing goes wrong.

417
00:23:59,080 --> 00:23:59,960
Got it?

418
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,720
Okay. Okay.

419
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,360
Doctors and nurses

420
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,800
and nurses?

421
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:07,640
Only nurses who watch him

422
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,600
to contact him.

423
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,280
and find a Chinese nurse

424
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,960
who doesn't know Japanese.

425
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,960
I need to make sure

426
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,480
the person who guards him.

427
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:19,480
You...

428
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:22,920
You two stay here.

429
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:25,800
Tell the director and the guard.

430
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,760
We'll be on guard from now on.

431
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,280
I'm going to the command center.

432
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,480
If someone

433
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,140
trying to break into the room,

434
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,920
You can just shoot.

435
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:53,840
Go away.

436
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,480
Okay.

437
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,400
Go away.

438
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,040
It's okay.

439
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:14,770
Don't be afraid.

440
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,120
Just answer a few questions,

441
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:21,240
you can leave here safely.

442
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:22,600
Okay?

443
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:29,600
Three days ago,

444
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,600
From 4 p.m. to 6 p.m.

445
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,280
Where are you?

446
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,320
Who are you with?

447
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,660
What are you doing?

448
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,480
I work in the hospital.

449
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,280
Doctors and nurses can prove it.

450
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:51,890
At that time,

451
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,000
Irigami was also in the military hospital.

452
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,560
Have you seen him?

453
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,640
I treated his wound.

454
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,400
However,

455
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,720
I never saw him again.

456
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,000
But...

457
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,800
the hospital said

458
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,800
he went to

459
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,800
the room you took care of.

460
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,480
No.

461
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,770
That's strange. He's not here.

462
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:37,000
Since you've never seen him again,

463
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,720
how did you know

464
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,560
he never went to that ward?

465
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:47,800
Looks like

466
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,080
we need to go to the hospital.

467
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:07,640
Colonel.

468
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:11,720
Commander and I

469
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,880
have something important to discuss.

470
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,840
Without my order,

471
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,370
no one is allowed to come in.

472
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,160
Commander.

473
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,040
What I want to talk to you today

474
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,400
is a very serious

475
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,280
and very important.

476
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,360
Go ahead.

477
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,000
Have a seat.

478
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,480
At the beginning of January last year,

479
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,600
General Daikoku.

480
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,480
Under His Majesty's order,

481
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,000
as the highest military officer

482
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,160
of Base Camp,

483
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,120
to inspect the Chinese war zone.

484
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,040
This is the first time

485
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,400
First time to come to the Chinese war zone

486
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,660
to conduct a comprehensive inspection.

487
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:58,960
I know that.

488
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,480
Daikoku Kiyoshi!

489
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,160
First, we arrived at Mukden.

490
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:03,400
and held

491
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,600
the highest military meeting in Kanto.

492
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,480
He made

493
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,640
in the meeting.

494
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,160
China China East.

495
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:14,160
The decision of South China War Area.

496
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,200
I saw this decision.

497
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,760
In the middle of January,

498
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,200
he arrived in Nanjing.

499
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:19,880
He held

500
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:22,560
a senior military meeting.

501
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:23,920
In this meeting,

502
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,800
Commander-in-chief of Shanghai garrison,

503
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:27,480
General Xiwei Shozo.

504
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,480
Chief Supervisor Panggan recruits the general of four doctors.

505
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,120
Commander of the North China.

506
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:33,400
General Doda.

507
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,400
3rd Captain of Flight Group.

508
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,920
General Kinoshita.

509
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,760
and the commander of Chinese fleet.

510
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,800
Major Shishida!

511
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,200
At the meeting,

512
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,320
On behalf of the Emperor,

513
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,000
and headquarters

514
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,000
to quickly occupy China

515
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,720
and take China

516
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:53,160
of the Pacific War.

517
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,560
of the Pacific War.

518
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,280
I know that too.

519
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:57,960
After that...

520
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,600
Daikoku Mojo!

521
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,880
He's taking his private plane, Weifeng.

522
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,760
and flew to Guangzhou

523
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,840
to Guangzhou.

524
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,320
On February 3 last year,

525
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,200
he flew from Guangzhou.

526
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,000
The 6th Airlines Base Sankanma

527
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,040
is maintaining

528
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,480
daily maintenance and maintenance.

529
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,680
On February 4th,

530
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,920
on February 4.

531
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:15,920
Is that so?

532
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:16,720
Yes.

533
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,720
It's the Major Major.

534
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,480
In our place,

535
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,800
for two days.

536
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:22,640
Really?

537
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:23,760
Yes.

538
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:26,080
During these two days,

539
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,800
in the past two days.

540
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,120
and the Special Forces Police Brigade

541
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,400
are working on

542
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:31,560
security and security.

543
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,200
Really?

544
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,720
Yes.

545
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,120
Is there a problem?

546
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,000
Yes.

547
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,480
I've checked the airport

548
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,880
and the Special Forces Police Brigade

549
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,640
[and the Special Forces Police Brigade.]

550
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,000
Especially on February 3,

551
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,120
on February 3

552
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,640
for four days.

553
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,360
During the investigation,

554
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,480
I found something big.

555
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:51,000
What?

556
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:53,360
A second-class soldier from the airport garrison

557
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:54,360
Report to me.

558
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,820
On February 4th last year,

559
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:56,840
he was on

560
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,280
on the plane,

561
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,680
I found an officer on our island

562
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,480
[In the air tank]

563
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,320
in the tank

564
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:08,640
in the aircraft oil tank.

565
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:10,880
What's that?

566
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,280
The sawdust.

567
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,160
I think it was built at the airport.

568
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,420
during the construction of the airport.

569
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,160
Commander.

570
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,600
Please.

571
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,880
After the sawdust entered the engine oil tank,

572
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,880
It's lighter than fuel,

573
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,640
it floats in the tank.

574
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,280
The top layer of the fuel.

575
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,640
Our pipeline

576
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,280
is below the tank.

577
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,840
This won't affect the starting flight.

578
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,240
and the first flight.

579
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,040
But after a period of flight,

580
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,760
the fuel is consuming.

581
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,560
Plus the rotation in the air

582
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,480
suddenly rises.

583
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,480
Descend.

584
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,480
The dust is inevitable

585
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,280
into the pipeline.

586
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,400
causing the oil circuit unstable.

587
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,360
Insufficient motivation.

588
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,360
Can't climb up.

589
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,840
or even crash.

590
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,360
This is horrible.

591
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:19,600
This is...

592
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,400
of the Major Major.

593
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,640
Why can't you fly

594
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,400
of 560 meters?

595
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,760
The real cause of the crash

596
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,560
So

597
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,480
your conclusion is

598
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:52,400
because someone

599
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,480
someone tampered with it.

600
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,530
To be precise, he is an officer.

601
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,960
You suspect...

602
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,480
He could be...

603
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:05,160
our guard

604
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,120
or the high-shot squadron.

605
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,840
or

606
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,640
Special Forces Police Brigade.

607
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,360
Is he...

608
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,240
Shogun-dono!

609
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:15,720
Please don't say

610
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,840
his name.

611
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,480
I have a very important witness

612
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,560
a very important witness.

613
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,560
The second-class soldier of the garrison team.

614
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:26,480
Although I have sent someone

615
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,560
to protect him,

616
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,720
But he's still very dangerous.

617
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:31,680
You mean my base...

618
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,680
You mean my base?

619
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,840
someone will kill him?

620
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:36,800
So,

621
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:39,040
I've authorized it to those who protect him.

622
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,160
to shoot at any time.

623
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,560
Kill those who want to kill him.

624
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:42,720
and those

625
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,840
who kidnapped him.

626
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,840
It makes me so nervous.

627
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,040
I need to change a name

628
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,920
Change a name and title

629
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,160
to make sure that officer

630
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:58,480
and the person behind him

631
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,000
will not kill him.

632
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,680
If you say so,

633
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,120
If His Majesty finds out,

634
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:30,680
I will be punished.

635
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,920
His Majesty sent me

636
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,240
to investigate this.

637
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:36,480
He will only see my report.

638
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,600
I'll try to avoid

639
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,640
the Commander.

640
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,640
Don’t worry.

641
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,600
Thank you, Colonel.

642
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:46,360
There are royal clans in the army.

643
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,240
and ruling factions.

644
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:49,160
Marines have ships too.

645
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,280
The battle with the treaty party.

646
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,160
I was worried

647
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,080
will be involved

648
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,840
But now,

649
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:02,480
it's inevitable.

650
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,040
These things

651
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,680
can't be decided by our will.

652
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:11,639
What is the name of the second class soldier?

653
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,159
No matter who he is,

654
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,130
I can arrest them immediately.

655
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,480
If you allow,

656
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,210
I can interrogate them myself.

657
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:22,960
Don't alert them.

658
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,560
The best way now

659
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,199
is to change his name

660
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,000
and move him out.

661
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,290
Change the name.

662
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,760
Transfer.

663
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:33,800
From now on

664
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,560
The name of the second class soldier

665
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,239
is Hakda Jang Soo.

666
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:38,679
I have a very important patient.

667
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:39,679
I need to transfer him

668
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:40,480
to you first.

669
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,880
for treatment.

670
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,159
I need your signature.

671
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:45,159
to accept this patient.

672
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:46,360
Hakda Jang-soo.

673
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,920
Hakda Jang Soo.

674
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,199
Commander.

675
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,800
Please...

676
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,929
remember this name.

677
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,880
No matter what,

678
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,480
as long as you see this name,

679
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:03,160
I hope you can let me go.

680
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,120
Hakuda Jang-soo.

681
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,000
Commander.

682
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,960
A small base officer

683
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,680
dare not do anything

684
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,480
to the Emperor.

685
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,380
The person behind this person

686
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,560
may be

687
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,880
than you.

688
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,160
If it leaks now,

689
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,880
Private

690
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,720
And that officer

691
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,920
will be killed.

692
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,000
You and I

693
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,720
in extreme danger.

694
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,320
Is it that serious?

695
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,000
Colonel,

696
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,640
You're just analyzing

697
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:01,880
You still lack direct evidence, don't you?

698
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,080
Have you heard of

699
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:05,040
Tokyo Bridge Longji Incident?

700
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,360
I vaguely heard something.

701
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:11,840
It happened

702
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,000
happened two months ago

703
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,680
Two months before I came to China,

704
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,200
Colonel Longji, Bridge.

705
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,960
The commander of the Army Headquarters Fumizuya.

706
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,690
Lieutenant.

707
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,680
Commander of Military Command.

708
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,240
General Miya.

709
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,520
the representative of Beijin Sect.

710
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,240
Was it confirmed

711
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,080
Colonel Obridge did it?

712
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,920
This happened

713
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,080
happened in the Korn.

714
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,680
Two months before he came to China,

715
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,680
his bullet-proof snow dragon sedan

716
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:09,520
at the Tokyo military meeting,

717
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,040
there was an explosion.

718
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,920
They're so mean.

719
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,280
Thank goodness.

720
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:17,560
General Horn wasn't in the car at that time.

721
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:20,280
His driver and secretary died for him.

722
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,800
What happened next?

723
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,240
The Tokyo Police Agency has found out.

724
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,920
The murderer is Colonel Longji, the bridge.

725
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,120
When they were about to arrest him,

726
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:34,080
General Kokuro suddenly ordered

727
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,480
to stop the investigation

728
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,480
and arrest the murderer.

729
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,520
Even for the sake of

730
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:40,640
for the sake of General Gong.

731
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,480
After that,

732
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,960
it was over.

733
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:44,400
And then?

734
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,480
Then the general died

735
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:50,080
fell off the plane at Mount Huangyang.

736
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,040
Then,

737
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,720
What are you going to do next?

738
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,080
I’m going to

739
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,240
to the Air 6 base secretly

740
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,560
to the garrison of Shanghai.

741
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,800
in Shanghai.

742
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:08,800
Shanghai.

743
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,240
I will start questioning him there.

744
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:15,400
When I get all the evidence,

745
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,080
and sufficient materials,

746
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,520
I’ll go back to Airlines 6.

747
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,200
Control this officer.

748
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,880
Find the man behind him.

749
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,040
to Shanghai.

750
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,080
This is the only way

751
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:30,640
to ensure his safety.

752
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,560
So I need a plane.

753
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,680
Are you sure?

754
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:41,400
Yes.

755
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,480
I'll arrange it.

756
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,450
How many people are you going to leave?

757
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,160
I hope you can

758
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,600
at any time.

759
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,000
Of course.

760
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,720
I'll keep you updated.

761
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,240
about the progress.

762
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,480
However,

763
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,600
During this period,

764
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:05,920
I hope Air 6

765
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,560
stop interfering with my investigation.

766
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,960
and threaten my woman.

767
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,200
and her family.

768
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,600
never happen again.

769
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,360
happens again.

770
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:17,040
You can order the Arsenal Squadron

771
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,540
to carry out military law.

772
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,520
you can call me directly.

773
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,680
Thank you.

774
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,160
I'll take you back to the private room.

775
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,560
Come with me.

776
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,680
