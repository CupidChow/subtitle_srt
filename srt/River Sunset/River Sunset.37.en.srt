1
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:44,680
Don't go to sea.

2
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:49,200
The Japanese will kill anyone who goes to sea.

3
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,560
Don't go to sea.

4
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:55,759
Will they really kill us?

5
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:56,520
Yes.

6
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,880
We cannot go to sea.

7
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,520
What should we do?

8
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,280
These Japanese are really trying to harm us.

9
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,680
Everyone, listen to me.

10
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,120
If going to sea

11
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,600
is a good thing.

12
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:10,400
I won't stop you from going.

13
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,680
But think about it.

14
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,000
Three years ago,

15
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,079
Three years ago,

16
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:21,240
the 'good citizen certificates' issued by the Japanese

17
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,500
caused the death of so many of our people.

18
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,400
Haven't you seen that?

19
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,420
That's absolutely right.

20
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,240
The fishermen are being stirred up.

21
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,400
What do we do now?

22
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:36,960
Get everyone on the boats!

23
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,120
Not a single person less.

24
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:41,180
Anyone who dares to resist will be executed on the spot.

25
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,960
When the Japanese daggers

26
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,040
pierced the chests of our loved ones.

27
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,520
The yellow sand

28
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,360
buried the faces of our loved ones.

29
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,720
Such inhuman atrocities,

30
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,960
such bloody lessons...

31
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,720
Have you all forgotten?

32
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,880
We're not going home.

33
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,400
We can't go to sea.

34
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,720
If we go to sea,

35
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,400
we might all be killed.

36
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,280
We can't go to sea.

37
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,160
Don't go to sea.

38
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,000
We must never go to sea.

39
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,400
We can't go to sea.

40
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,360
Everyone get down!

41
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,079
Get down!

42
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,400
Fellow villagers,

43
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,880
Through a hundred battles in the desert,

44
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,800
wearing golden armor,

45
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,560
we won't return until Loulan is conquered.

46
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,080
Now the entire country,

47
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,010
is fighting against the invasion.

48
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,040
How can we not join together

49
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,700
to face this national crisis?

50
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,159
Children,

51
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,040
Show your courage

52
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,680
and unite together.

53
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,040
The Japanese are doomed.

54
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,680
We must fight against them to the end.

55
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,640
Fight to the end!

56
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,560
Fight to the end!

57
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,480
Don't go to sea!

58
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,480
Fight to the end!

59
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:57,120
We can't go to sea!

60
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:07,280
Fight to the end!

61
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,960
Don't go to sea!

62
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,560
We must fight to the end!

63
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:15,640
Don't go to sea!

64
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,520
Stay on land!

65
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,000
Xia'er.

66
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,800
Xia'er.

67
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,159
Xia'er.

68
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,800
Xia'er.

69
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,240
Xia'er.

70
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,400
Xia'er.

71
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,800
Xia'er.

72
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,000
Xia'er.

73
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,960
Sir.

74
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:27,920
You.

75
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,160
Why did you come back?

76
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,800
Dad.

77
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,800
Why did you come back?

78
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,080
Why did you come back?

79
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:06,880
Sir.

80
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,280
Father.

81
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,760
Why did you come back?

82
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,760
Dad, sir.

83
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,800
Why didn't you listen?

84
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,960
I'm sorry.

85
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,040
You did something foolish,

86
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,080
but it's not shameful.

87
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,880
It's not shameful.

88
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,040
Ying'er.

89
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,800
I've already lost my son.

90
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,600
I can't lose my daughter too.

91
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:54,400
Stop the killing! Blood debts must be paid in blood!

92
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,530
Fellow countrymen!

93
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,840
The Japanese have invaded our China.

94
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,520
Why should we swallow our anger?

95
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,920
Sanzao Island

96
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,320
is our home!

97
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:10,360
Sanzao Island is our home!

98
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,480
Three thousand miles of rivers

99
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,520
flowing east to the sea.

100
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,160
Five thousand fathoms of mountains

101
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,080
reaching to the sky.

102
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,960
The tears of the people have dried

103
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,960
in the foreign dust.

104
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,520
Another year passes as we look south for our saviors.

105
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,920
Although

106
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:29,720
we have no royal army now.

107
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,480
We are our own saviors!

108
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:38,200
My fellow villagers!

109
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,000
Unite together!

110
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:45,720
We swear to die before leaving our shores!

111
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,680
Abort mission.

112
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:03,880
Why?

113
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:06,840
I order you

114
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,520
to abort the mission.

115
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,200
Mission aborted.

116
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,960
Yes.

117
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,020
Sorry for the embarrassment.

118
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,400
It's nothing.

119
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,560
Let's go.

120
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,200
All right.

121
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:34,800
I really didn't expect

122
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,330
that you would see all this.

123
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,640
I'm sorry.

124
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,680
I understand.

125
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:47,280
I do need to take a break.

126
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,040
Don't be too upset.

127
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,240
Sakamoto.

128
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:53,800
Yes.

129
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:56,600
Please.

130
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,050
Come here

131
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:06,940
and get Oshima.

132
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:07,760
Yes.

133
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,480
Commander,

134
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,960
why did you abort the plan?

135
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,490
I really don't understand.

136
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,000
Your maritime reopening plan

137
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
has been published

138
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,520
in newspapers in Macau and many countries.

139
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:33,120
Journalists from everywhere are on merchant ships in Macau

140
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,920
waiting to see you fail.

141
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,060
How could this happen?

142
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,720
Impossible.

143
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,320
What do you mean impossible?

144
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,680
How is it not possible?

145
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,320
Our Sanzao Island Sixth Air Base

146
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,080
has become world-famous now.

147
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,680
Explain to me.

148
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,360
Explain.

149
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,280
I never expected

150
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,360
things would turn out like this.

151
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,960
That maritime reopening plan of yours,

152
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,560
how many copies were distributed?

153
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,280
Two.

154
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,160
One was submitted to you, Commander,

155
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,319
and the other was given to

156
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:17,079
Major Rongzezuo from the Rong Agency in Macau.

157
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,880
I requested their cooperation.

158
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:19,920
Cooperation?

159
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,520
Did they cooperate by publishing the entire plan

160
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:24,800
as front-page headlines in newspapers?

161
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,000
I'm not sure yet.

162
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:30,080
I plan to immediately organize resources

163
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,530
to thoroughly investigate this leak.

164
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,080
Investigation.

165
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,480
Look at all these messes you've made.

166
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,200
You've even alarmed

167
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:40,800
the Military Command

168
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,260
and the Foreign Ministry.

169
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,680
I know what I should do.

170
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,120
Today at Mr. Ye's house,

171
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,580
we found carrier pigeons.

172
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,840
This leak incident

173
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,120
is connected to their carrier pigeons.

174
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:54,720
Of course it's related.

175
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,720
All those newspapers in Macau published

176
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,720
your entire plan.

177
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,240
Even beggars on the streets of Macau

178
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,040
know what you're planning to do.

179
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,160
Their relatives in Macau

180
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,480
notified the Ye family by carrier pigeons.

181
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,960
You shot and killed his son.

182
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,760
How can you say it's not related?

183
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,040
This is just one possibility.

184
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:21,760
My thoughts are contrary to the commander's.

185
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,200
What did you say?

186
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,880
The intelligence didn't go from Macau to Sanzao Island,

187
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,680
but from Sanzao Island to Macau.

188
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,040
Sanzao Island

189
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:33,000
gave the intelligence to Macau.

190
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,660
All the secrets are within the Ye family.

191
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,640
The Ye family used carrier pigeons to transmit to Macau.

192
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,920
Is it the Ye family?

193
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,840
How did the Ye family get your plan?

194
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,210
I feel there might be another reason for the leak.

195
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,840
There were two documents in total.

196
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,840
So you're suggesting the leak came from me?

197
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,440
What are you really thinking?

198
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,640
I didn't say that.

199
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,560
I'm planning to arrest everyone in the Ye family.

200
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,760
Once I've clarified all the facts,

201
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,760
I'll report to the General.

202
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:01,290
I won't allow you to do this.

203
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,400
In front of the special envoy

204
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,760
and General Sakagawa,

205
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,120
you shot and killed the envoy's woman's brother,

206
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,180
and now you want to arrest her family.

207
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,040
When did you become

208
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,520
so reckless?

209
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,400
Just raising carrier pigeons

210
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,160
and secretly communicating with Macau

211
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,090
is enough to condemn the Ye family.

212
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,220
It has nothing to do with the pigeons.

213
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:16,800
Besides,

214
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,960
you know absolutely nothing about diplomacy.

215
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:21,440
Diplomacy is about establishing

216
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:24,000
the most stable channel of communication with the outside world.

217
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,880
Arresting the Ye family is just my means.

218
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,320
The ultimate goal is to uncover the person

219
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,160
who helped the Ye family obtain the plans.

220
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,960
Like Major Wumu.

221
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:35,760
Why do you

222
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,440
keep provoking the envoy,

223
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:38,160
Commander?

224
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,440
Because there are too many suspicious things about him.

225
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,760
Is he really an envoy from the palace?

226
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,360
And he's in love with a Chinese woman.

227
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,440
Just this alone is extremely unusual.

228
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,860
Is that your reason for shooting?

229
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:58,960
Get out of here!

230
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,640
Think it through

231
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,520
before you come see me again.

232
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,080
Commander,

233
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,200
please calm down.

234
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,800
Although there's no evidence now,

235
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,040
we can't rule out

236
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,040
that the Major leaked information.

237
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:19,960
Go close the door.

238
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,600
If you think there's an issue with the Colonel's identity,

239
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,800
tell me.

240
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,360
Now the Emperor's confidential letter is in your hands.

241
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,020
If any problem is discovered,

242
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,200
you can say I gave you the letter.

243
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,840
But if nothing is found,

244
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,520
then you stole the letter from me.

245
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,200
Understand?

246
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,720
Captain Oshima.

247
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,880
I'm coming in.

248
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,800
Come in.

249
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:13,560
Is everything arranged with the Lieutenant General?

250
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:14,640
Yes, it's all arranged.

251
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,120
What is the Colonel doing now?

252
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,050
Probably at the Ye family's place.

253
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,960
He's accompanying the person who was beaten to death

254
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,490
back to Tanjiawan Village.

255
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,440
What?

256
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,720
Do I need to go there?

257
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:28,560
No need.

258
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,860
He'll be back soon.

259
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:30,880
Yes.

260
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,740
I'll take my leave now.

261
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,760
Sir,

262
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,960
we've found the mole.

263
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:28,720
It's Haozi.

264
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,530
Are you sure?

265
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,480
Absolutely certain.

266
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,040
Old Yi, take care of it.

267
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,400
Let's go.

268
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,600
Here's your tea, gentlemen.

269
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,260
Let me keep you company, okay?

270
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,680
What's going on here?

271
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,290
Let's go.

272
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,720
No acting as a spy

273
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,320
or betraying our own people.

274
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:12,640
No acting as a spy

275
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,000
or betraying our own people.

276
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,120
If violated,

277
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,400
may lightning strike you dead.

278
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,720
If violated,

279
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,040
may lightning strike you dead.

280
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,480
No defying moral principles

281
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,960
or plotting against the leader.

282
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,760
No defying moral principles

283
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,120
or plotting against the leader.

284
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,440
If violated,

285
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,800
may lightning strike you dead.

286
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,880
If violated,

287
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,520
may lightning strike you dead.

288
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:32,360
No secretly helping outsiders

289
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,720
or deceiving our brotherhood.

290
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,840
No secretly helping outsiders

291
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,000
or deceiving our brotherhood.

292
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,440
Is today's action by the police squad

293
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,280
meant as a warning to me?

294
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,640
I apologize for

295
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,200
the police squad's behavior.

296
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,600
Isn't there something deeper

297
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,560
behind their actions?

298
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,120
Please don't overthink it.

299
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,040
Their approach was indeed inappropriate.

300
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:24,840
As my investigation into

301
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,920
the Dakaku Mineo plane crash deepens,

302
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,360
these incidents are becoming more frequent.

303
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,000
If at Huangyang Mountain

304
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,760
it was just surveillance and restriction,

305
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,040
then today they're targeting me directly.

306
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:33,480
This is a warning.

307
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,080
You're overthinking.

308
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,440
Today's incident was purely accidental.

309
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,800
In a few days, I will personally

310
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,640
invite Mr. Ye to come

311
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,680
and apologize in person.

312
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,600
Apologize?

313
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,840
If you cannot stop

314
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,720
these provocative actions

315
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,240
from the police squad,

316
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,440
then I will bring

317
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,370
the Southern Army from Guangzhou.

318
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:50,480
Major.

319
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,760
Please trust me.

320
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,600
I will definitely give you

321
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,400
a satisfactory answer

322
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,400
to this matter.

323
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,200
I hope so.

324
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,860
I'll take my leave.

325
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,720
I hope you'll join me

326
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,650
for dinner with Lieutenant General Sunakawa Kaneo.

327
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,240
After everything that happened today,

328
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,360
do you really expect me to sit

329
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,040
at the dinner table making pleasant conversation?

330
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:20,720
I'm sorry,

331
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:22,960
I cannot join you.

332
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,050
Ying'er.

333
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,850
This is the bracelet your mother left behind.

334
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:53,050
She wanted to give it to her daughter-in-law.

335
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,040
Give it to Ju'er.

336
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,320
Ju'er.

337
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,340
This should have been given to you

338
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,640
by my brother himself.

339
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,080
Report!

340
00:33:59,280 --> 00:33:59,960
Come in.

341
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,239
There's a call from the Jingshang Mansion.

342
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:16,560
Inoue Akira has informed us that

343
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,960
an investigator from Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department's Sixth Division,

344
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,360
Yabei Jiro,

345
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,820
has already taken a ship to the Sixth Air Base

346
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,480
and will arrive at Sanzao Island tomorrow.

347
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:27,860
Excellent.

348
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,940
Who is this person?

349
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,040
Commander Fujita has always been uncertain

350
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,199
whether Colonel Wumu is problematic.

351
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,090
This is a good opportunity.

352
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,840
We can use the investigator

353
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,199
to expose the Colonel's secrets.

354
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:43,520
Whether we believe it or not, we have to accept it.

355
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:44,719
Seeing is believing.

356
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,239
By the way,

357
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,760
this person is coming to the island

358
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,760
to investigate matters concerning the Colonel.

359
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:51,719
Only we

360
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:54,520
and the Inoue Mansion in Shanghai know about this.

361
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,080
What about Commander Fujita?

362
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,960
Don't worry.

363
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,800
As for the Commander,

364
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:01,640
he only knows that

365
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,640
a special envoy has come from Tokyo.

366
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:08,960
We've already created a false identity for the envoy.

367
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,240
He will visit as the head of the General Affairs Section

368
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,000
of the Ministry of Colonial Affairs.

369
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,040
If the Commander asks,

370
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,560
just answer like that.

371
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,520
Understood.

372
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,160
Hello?

373
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,040
This is Akino.

374
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:51,920
Akino,

375
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,080
Commander.

376
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:54,760
Please repeat to me

377
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,640
the Colonel's whereabouts last night.

378
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,480
Yes,

379
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,080
last night the Colonel drove

380
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,960
away from the airfield barracks.

381
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:02,760
Not long after,

382
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,160
about half an hour,

383
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:05,680
after he returned,

384
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,540
he stayed in his room with Miss Ye.

385
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,720
Listen to me,

386
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,800
the Colonel has been quite agitated these days.

387
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,360
You need to monitor his movements at all times

388
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,020
and report to me immediately.

389
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:16,320
Yes, I'll watch him closely.

390
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,650
This man is very shrewd.

391
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,320
Make sure he doesn't notice

392
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,120
your surveillance activities.

393
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,040
During these days,

394
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,560
you just need to faithfully follow his orders

395
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,840
and assist with his investigation.

396
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:27,120
Report any unusual situations to me immediately.

397
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,760
Yes, I understand.

398
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:38,760
Report, sir.

399
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:39,640
Come in.

400
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,520
Excuse me.

401
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,440
The Shanghai garrison sent a telegram.

402
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,720
Tomorrow, the Colonial Ministry

403
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,800
is sending a General Affairs Section Chief to our base.

404
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,840
The Colonial Ministry?

405
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,480
Yes.

406
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,280
What are they coming for?

407
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,280
The telegram doesn't specify

408
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,810
the reason for their visit.

409
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,200
Go ask Oshima

410
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,000
who arranged this person's visit

411
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,760
and what they're coming for.

412
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:14,320
Also tell him

413
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,760
they're not allowed to bother Ye Degong anymore.

414
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,520
Understood.

415
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:22,040
How are the dinner preparations coming along?

416
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:22,880
Yes,

417
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,520
dinner is ready

418
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,760
and the Lieutenant General will arrive soon.

419
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,760
Good.

420
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:32,890
Let's go.

421
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,920
Life or death

422
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,520
has never been for us to decide.

423
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,920
What we can decide

424
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,120
is how we live

425
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,520
before death comes.

426
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,480
I want revenge.

427
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,640
I must have my revenge.

428
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,370
Completing our mission

429
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,520
is the best revenge.

430
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,080
Everyone,

431
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,560
personal radios and electric razors.

432
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,360
It's forbidden to use these on the ship.

433
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:31,880
Hand them all over.

434
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,200
Why is that?

435
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,360
Using any electronic devices

436
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:35,240
could allow the Japanese

437
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,770
to track our radio signals.

438
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:57,920
These navy guys really don't like us

439
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,180
on their ship, do they?

440
00:40:59,560 --> 00:40:59,920
Look at this.

441
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,650
Who's been hiding one of these?

442
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,000
Tomorrow I'll meet the legendary

443
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,200
Bull General, right?

444
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,480
Yes, you will.

445
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,960
Why does everyone call the Admiral 'Bull'?

446
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,240
On November 28 last year,

447
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,120
ten days before Pearl Harbor,

448
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,040
Halsey was ordered to lead the Enterprise carrier group

449
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,920
to deliver aircraft to Wake Island.

450
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,600
He was on his way back

451
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,200
when he learned about the Pearl Harbor attack.

452
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,960
Halsey was furious.

453
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,640
He even disregarded the Pacific Fleet Commander's reaction

454
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:45,360
and went searching for the retreating Japanese fleet.

455
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,120
Unfortunately, he couldn't find

456
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,040
the Japanese forces withdrawing from Pearl Harbor.

457
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:48,920
But since then, every day

458
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,780
he's been preparing for revenge.

459
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:52,840
He truly is a bull.

460
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:58,400
Do you have any family members involved in the war too?

461
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,040
My son.

462
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,130
He's in the Army.

463
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,520
He's currently in South Carolina

464
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:05,720
receiving training.

465
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,820
He'll likely end up in the European theater.

466
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,080
If this war continues for another three years,

467
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:16,410
my son will be old enough to be drafted too.

468
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:19,600
For their sake, we need to

469
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,660
end this damn war as soon as possible.
