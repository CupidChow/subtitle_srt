1
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,120
Don't look at me like that.

2
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,400
Help me find it.

3
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:26,800
There it is!

4
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,240
That's right.

5
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,400
It's him.

6
00:02:40,079 --> 00:02:40,800
We can use him.

7
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,640
I'll go find Ju.

8
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:51,840
Captain!

9
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:52,600
Search the whole village.

10
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,600
No one was found.

11
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,600
Nothing suspicious either.

12
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,480
Nothing?

13
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,320
Yes.

14
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,680
Keep searching the mountain.

15
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,720
Don't miss anything suspicious.

16
00:02:59,079 --> 00:02:59,680
Search the mountain.

17
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,240
Miss Ye.

18
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,040
Interpreter Luo.

19
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,800
I'm here to get the medicine for the commander.

20
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,280
What a coincidence.

21
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,400
to meet you here.

22
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:33,760
What a coincidence.

23
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,920
Are you waiting for someone?

24
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,560
Colonel Takemici.

25
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,120
Colonel is so lucky.

26
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,320
to have a woman like you.

27
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,280
Ju.

28
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:48,960
Ying.

29
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:50,640
You're finally off work.

30
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,680
What's up?

31
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,160
Let's talk somewhere else.

32
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,120
Okay.

33
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,080
Tell me.

34
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,640
What's the matter?

35
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,760
This afternoon,

36
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,360
that Japanese bullied you.

37
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,040
and worried about you.

38
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,399
So I came to see you.

39
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,160
It happens all the time.

40
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,480
That Japanese soldier is a coward.

41
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,120
He's holding his breath.

42
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,480
You can only vent it with me.

43
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,400
The world is tough now.

44
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,640
You've been wronged

45
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,400
working in the Japanese army hospital.

46
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,320
I have to be bullied by them all day.

47
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,320
If I don't do this job,

48
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,280
I might end up like Hye Hye.

49
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,200
Still, you can't let others slaughter you.

50
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,960
We need a goal in life.

51
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,520
I have a goal.

52
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,880
Do you know

53
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,600
who I live for?

54
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,800
For whom?

55
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,480
I said

56
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,040
Don't laugh at me.

57
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,240
Brother Dragonfly.

58
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,080
Shameless.

59
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,880
You always want to be my sister-in-law.

60
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:18,480
You promised not to laugh at me.

61
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,400
Just kidding.

62
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:23,640
In my heart,

63
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,160
you are my sister-in-law.

64
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,080
Brother Dragonfly.

65
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,720
is the only hope

66
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,600
for me to live.

67
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,200
My brother is so lucky.

68
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:46,960
Ju.

69
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,800
Have you ever thought

70
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,680
Without the Japanese,

71
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,800
Now,

72
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:53,080
you and my brother

73
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,480
really married.

74
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,720
and my sister-in-law.

75
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,600
Of course I want to.

76
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,640
I think about it every day.

77
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,480
every day.

78
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,120
I just hope the Japanese

79
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,680
get out of Sanbu Island.

80
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:15,120
Ju.

81
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,000
Let me ask you.

82
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,960
This afternoon

83
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,400
the second-class soldier

84
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,240
Is it

85
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,800
who harmed Huihui?

86
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,320
is him.

87
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:25,160
That bastard.

88
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,960
You took care of him.

89
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,840
But your brother told me every day

90
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,680
to kill him.

91
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,480
I was so scared.

92
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,920
He deserves to die.

93
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,520
Ju.

94
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,400
I need your help.

95
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,760
I also have an injured soldier here.

96
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,640
He has a fracture.

97
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,720
He has a fever.

98
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,720
Takemici and I have a plan.

99
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,320
to switch him with your wounded soldier.

100
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,960
to take care of him.

101
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,600
I'm a doctor.

102
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,560
I'll tell you what to do.

103
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,960
You're a doctor.

104
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,480
What about Takemichi?

105
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,800
Who are you?

106
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,640
Ju.

107
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:14,920
No matter what we do,

108
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,200
you have to trust me.

109
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,880
We're not bad people.

110
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,240
We won't do anything bad.

111
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,320
Only you can help me with this.

112
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,480
Bik-ying.

113
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,080
This is too big.

114
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:32,520
If the Japanese find out,

115
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,400
they will be executed.

116
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,480
Ju.

117
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,800
You always think the hospital is your shelter.

118
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,280
It can protect you.

119
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,240
However,

120
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,240
[Even heaven is hell]

121
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,920
even heaven is hell.

122
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:45,960
This is

123
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:46,360
to me,

124
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,080
to anyone,

125
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,200
to anyone.

126
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:52,840
Is the injured soldier

127
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:55,000
Is he the American

128
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,480
looking for?

129
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,400
So you came to the island

130
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,240
to save him.

131
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,480
Why should we risk our lives

132
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,800
to save an American?

133
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,000
We're fighting

134
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,760
with the Americans.

135
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,880
We must stop the Japanese

136
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,160
and slave the whole world.

137
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,480
Where is that American now?

138
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,520
Somewhere safe.

139
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,559
Ju.

140
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:36,919
Don't be afraid.

141
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,000
As long as you have faith,

142
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,120
as long as you have faith,

143
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,280
you'll have courage.

144
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,240
You can do it.

145
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,560
I'm not like you.

146
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,280
I'm not a brave person.

147
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,640
I wasn't.

148
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:49,840
But as long as I have faith,

149
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,200
people will grow.

150
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,120
This is too big.

151
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,200
Let me think about it.

152
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,480
Okay?

153
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,240
Okay.

154
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,800
But don't

155
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,560
about this.

156
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,840
Okay.

157
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,240
I won't let dad know.

158
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,200
Tell me when you've made up your mind.

159
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,720
Okay.

160
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,120
Yuichi Suzuki.

161
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,640
Yes.

162
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,400
Hurry up.

163
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,600
Colonel.

164
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,560
Yuichi Suzuki.

165
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,920
Last February,

166
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,880
[the private jet General Taikok took]

167
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,040
Before the bee incident,

168
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,280
before the accident.

169
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,720
for daily maintenance and maintenance.

170
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:01,960
At that time,

171
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,560
you were on duty.

172
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,280
right?

173
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:05,360
Yes.

174
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,360
I need to ask you something.

175
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,160
I'll ask.

176
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,240
You answer.

177
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,720
What time was it?

178
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,480
at that day?

179
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,760
Colonel.

180
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,520
Last February,

181
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,680
It's been too long.

182
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,640
I don't remember the exact time.

183
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,920
Take your time.

184
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,520
But you have to remember

185
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,920
when did you switch shifts?

186
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,200
Who was there?

187
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,920
or who touched the plane,

188
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,520
you have to make it clear to me.

189
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,720
Captain.

190
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,280
We found a cave on the mountain.

191
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,040
Captain.

192
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:57,600
Captain.

193
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,120
This way.

194
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,360
Where?

195
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,040
We're almost there.

196
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,240
This way.

197
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,160
Captain.

198
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,360
Thank you.

199
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,640
Salute.

200
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,480
Captain.

201
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:47,240
Is it the American who skydiving?

202
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,520
It can't be wrong.

203
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,080
Block this area quickly.

204
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,200
Yes, sir.

205
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,280
Get another team to back us up.

206
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,480
Okay, I'll be right there.

207
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,040
What are you looking for?

208
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,720
A car came here.

209
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,920
A car?

210
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,720
Find out what happened at the base yesterday.

211
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,720
Yes.

212
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:22,600
There was no mission yesterday.

213
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,480
Did our colonel

214
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,720
came here too?

215
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,040
In that case,

216
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,240
we won't be able to find anything.

217
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,520
I don’t want to suspect Colonel.

218
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:33,960
But the evidence

219
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,280
point to him.

220
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,720
Should we take action on him?

221
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,200
There are more than ten cars like this in the base.

222
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,480
How can we prove

223
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:46,840
the wheel track belongs to him?

224
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,880
Captain.

225
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:53,760
Captain!

226
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,960
Team 4 is here!

227
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,200
Captain!

228
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,320
Team 4 was ordered to arrive.

229
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,880
We have 36 people.

230
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,480
Thirty-one.

231
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,640
There are five missing. Why?

232
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,880
Airport Defence's high-shot squadron

233
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,920
We sent a car to pick up five people.

234
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:14,640
The investigator from Tokyo.

235
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,120
who came from Tokyo?

236
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:15,920
I think so.

237
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,040
Irigami.

238
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,320
You stay here and organize the investigation.

239
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,680
I'm going to the airport guard.

240
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,200
Don't you need more people?

241
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:25,760
No.

242
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:42,920
I'm leaving.

243
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:43,960
My brother is here.

244
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,760
I'll get him for you.

245
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,080
No need.

246
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,200
I'll get it for you.

247
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,080
No.

248
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,280
Stop calling you brother.

249
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:11,680
What?

250
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,880
Ju is outside.

251
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:15,360
Go.

252
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:15,760
Ju.

253
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,360
What is it?

254
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,480
Ju will have to take care of the Major.

255
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,480
Tell her.

256
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:22,480
Go.

257
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:22,840
Okay.

258
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,080
Xia.

259
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:25,960
Where are you going?

260
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,400
Dad.

261
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,400
I'll be right back.

262
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,480
Excuse me.

263
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,880
What are you two mumbling about?

264
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,320
Nothing.

265
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,600
Is Ju outside?

266
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,040
About the Major,

267
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,560
I need Ju'er's help.

268
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,320
I'll ask my brother to tell her.

269
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,280
If it weren’t for this war,

270
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,360
Xia and Ju would have been married.

271
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,280
Maybe

272
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:03,360
even hold his grandson.

273
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,160
Okay.

274
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,120
Hurry!

275
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,600
Captain Oshima

276
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:45,360
What do you want from my soldiers?

277
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,160
Colonel, you need to know

278
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,400
Last year,

279
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,640
in the last year.

280
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,760
That was

281
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,080
the Defense Brigade and the Special Forces Police Brigade

282
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,200
Each team will pick one member

283
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,600
to be on duty.

284
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,960
I think so.

285
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,560
All participants

286
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,760
who participated in

287
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,000
must be questioned.

288
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:21,640
Captain Oshima.

289
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,960
Are you looking for me?

290
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,599
I always want to arrange a time

291
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:28,280
to invite you to dinner.

292
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:28,920
Go ahead.

293
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,200
I'll pick another time.

294
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,520
Sorry.

295
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,880
I've been busy these days.

296
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:40,960
I forgot about it.

297
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:41,880
Like this.

298
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:42,560
Today...

299
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,680
I'll finish work early today.

300
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,880
Let's get together tonight.

301
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,600
Tonight then.

302
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:47,880
Deal.

303
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:50,720
Akino-san!

304
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,840
Oshima-san's treat tonight.

305
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,160
Come with me.

306
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,720
It's an honor.

307
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,120
Ta-da.

308
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:58,720
By the way,

309
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,440
Check.

310
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,000
I checked the staff and list.

311
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,760
Among the people on duty that day,

312
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,360
Why is one missing today?

313
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,520
Let me check.

314
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,640
Check.

315
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,280
Check.

316
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,640
Someone is missing.

317
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,600
I see.

318
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:17,920
Check.

319
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,000
The defence team is missing.

320
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,680
Private Leiji.

321
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:22,400
Where is he?

322
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,160
A few days ago, he went out to look for a girl.

323
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,760
but the villagers broke his bones.

324
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,280
He's lying in

325
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:29,240
in the hospital.

326
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:31,960
Check.

327
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:32,680
Okay.

328
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,320
Put this person at the end.

329
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:35,520
Yes.

330
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,680
Bye.

331
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:38,600
Get back to work.

332
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,120
Okay.

333
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:40,120
See you tonight.

334
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:46,560
Call the next person.

335
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,160
What do you think about

336
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,280
what do you think?

337
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,360
Ju.

338
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:18,560
Don't be afraid.

339
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,880
No one will force you

340
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,360
to do things you don't want to do.

341
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,280
I'm scared.

342
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,720
I just want to live

343
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,160
with you.

344
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,080
I'm not as brave as you.

345
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,480
And I'm afraid...

346
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,560
I'm afraid

347
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:41,880
will be more cruel.

348
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:43,840
Their cruelty

349
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:45,240
has never changed.

350
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,680
Brother Dragonfly.

351
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,840
Tell me.

352
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,280
what will happen

353
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,240
after they die?

354
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:03,400
I don't know.

355
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,080
I never thought about it.

356
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:08,200
How can I not?

357
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,920
Something scary.

358
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,080
I never wanted to.

359
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,800
No matter what,

360
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,280
what will come will come.

361
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,320
You'll be scared too.

362
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,600
I'm not afraid if I were myself.

363
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,120
But sometimes,

364
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,160
I think of my dad

365
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,480
and Ying Er.

366
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,360
and you,

367
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,080
I'm really scared.

368
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,840
I made you laugh at me.

369
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:54,000
I heard from the elders in the village

370
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,120
people become stars after they die.

371
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,400
If someone misses him

372
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:04,240
If you see a star

373
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:07,080
it means those who miss him are thinking about him.

374
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:09,960
Is that so?

375
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,800
Ju.

376
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,960
In the sky of Sanbu Island,

377
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,960
is sad.

378
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,520
Japanese should die.

379
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,880
When the Japanese really leave,

380
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,640
our Sankanma...

381
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,680
No.

382
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,160
The whole country is free.

383
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,320
we can

384
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:31,920
be together for real.

385
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,640
forever.

386
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,240
Jimmy.

387
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:12,720
You should leave now.

388
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,640
Good luck, guys.

389
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,480
Sir.

390
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,240
I beg you.

391
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,520
arrange a plane for me today.

392
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,120
I can't stay any longer.

393
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:56,640
Listen.

394
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,040
All British

395
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,680
have collapsed in Myanmar.

396
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,680
That's hell.

397
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,520
You're going to die if you leave now.

398
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,880
Where is the plane you promised me?

399
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:05,640
In the past week,

400
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,040
I didn't see any plane.

401
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,200
Do you know why?

402
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,000
Major.

403
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,400
They're looking for

404
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,520
the route to China,

405
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,680
was destroyed.

406
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,040
This route is located

407
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,920
a mountain in Nanlu

408
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,720
It's like a mountain in the back of a camel.

409
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,040
The top of the sea

410
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,760
is over 8,000 meters.

411
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,040
The whole route

412
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:33,640
Gosan Snow Peak

413
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,160
Canyon Ice River.

414
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:35,920
The average height

415
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,920
over six kilometers.

416
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,360
And the flying height

417
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,640
can only reach

418
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,120
can only reach 5 km.

419
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,560
In other words,

420
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:48,200
you can only fly in the valley.

421
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,040
Only two of the six planes

422
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:52,560
only two flew to China.

423
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,880
Four fell

424
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,880
[was destroyed in China.]

425
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:55,800
Major.

426
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:56,600
That's why

427
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,320
you didn't see

428
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,600
last week.

429
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,200
I have a plane.

430
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,480
I can help you.

431
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,480
But I have to warn you.

432
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,000
This is very dangerous.

433
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:03,560
I know.

434
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,080
I'm willing to take the risk.

435
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,520
This is a suicide flight.

436
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,480
Major.

437
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,640
I hope you're not the second Wilt Chen.

438
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,000
Sir.

439
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,760
I can't wait any longer.

440
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,280
Take me to the coordination room.

441
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,680
Lu Hang, 347.

442
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:37,640
Keep the height of 3,524.

443
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:39,640
3407 got it.

444
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:00,880
Turn right.

445
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,800
Height 3,05 meters.

446
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,280
No.

447
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,680
The mountain on the left.

448
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,400
Up to 6,500 meters.

449
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,840
There's a mountain on the right.

450
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:25,920
Charlie.

451
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,520
Pull him up.

452
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,560
Oh my god.

453
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,480
No.

454
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,880
Charlie.

455
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,000
Pull him up.

456
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,880
The second believer.

457
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,720
[fell off the plane]

458
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,400
fell off the plane and died.

459
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,480
Please do your best in the Chinese war zone.

460
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:52,120
to rescue the believers

461
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,680
who was trapped in the Japanese base.

462
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,640
and sent him to Qizhou Airport

463
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,480
on April 18.

464
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:23,880
Captain.

465
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,280
I heard.

466
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,040
The body was stolen?

467
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,160
What's going on?

468
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,720
Hello?

469
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,560
What's going on over there?

470
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,000
We searched

471
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,400
the Mount Hutang.

472
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,240
Nothing new.

473
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,120
Tell them to go back and rest.

474
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,840
Inform all leaders to have a meeting.

475
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,200
Dismiss.

476
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,600
The day before yesterday,

477
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,480
the North of the base was attacked.

478
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,680
Another smuggling case occurred at night.

479
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,240
During the investigation,

480
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:39,960
Captain Irikami found

481
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,240
on the shore.

482
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,960
[We found the footprints on the plane]

483
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,160
we found the American hiding place

484
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,160
on the plane.

485
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,120
In Tan Jiawan this afternoon,

486
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,040
the body of the stowaway

487
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,600
was stolen by the people again.

488
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,240
Why are we so passive?

489
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,200
Did the headquarters ask about the progress?

490
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:07,200
Commander Fujita is very angry about this.

491
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,680
He asked me to solve the case

492
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,800
within a week.

493
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,680
Anyway,

494
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,760
all signs indicate that

495
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:19,480
the cave we searched today

496
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,280
is where the Americans are hiding.

497
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:25,760
We were too late.

498
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,960
We focus

499
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:30,480
to the beach and Tan Jia Wan Village.

500
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,240
We've been thinking

501
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,240
what went wrong.

502
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,240
A stranger landed on the island.

503
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,080
Without the help of the locals,

504
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,640
without the help of the locals?

505
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,480
Sasaki is right.

506
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,520
Where is this American

507
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,400
hiding now?

508
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:53,320
A sentry has gone missing.

509
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,040
I think

510
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,480
he found out by chance.

511
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,560
This American...

512
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:58,760
was killed by him.

513
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:02,040
The body was buried somewhere.

514
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,320
What should we do next?

515
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,600
I want to know what you think.

516
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,520
Tell me.

517
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:13,840
If we catch this American,

518
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,480
everything will be clear.

519
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,160
I can feel

520
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,480
I can catch him soon.

521
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,600
There are too many things

522
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,880
on the island these days.

523
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,280
How dare they take the body?

524
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:26,640
This is the first time

525
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,920
on the island.

526
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,320
The Macau triad

527
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,400
for two or three years.

528
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:37,160
This time, I suddenly came back.

529
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,040
It doesn't look like an independent case.

530
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,400
Maybe he came to pick up this American.

531
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,200
I think so too.

532
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,560
The popularity of Chinese on the island

533
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,840
is growing.

534
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,160
When the bodies were taken away by them,

535
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,640
the situation was almost out of control.

536
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,720
It seems that keeping these scoundrels

537
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:53,960
is a disaster.

538
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:59,920
I think there must be something

539
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,520
must have something to do with the islanders.

540
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,680
Commander Fujita.

541
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:08,800
I always believe that kind of benevolent policy

542
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,280
I think we should

543
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,120
all of them.

544
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,320
Kill them all.

545
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:20,040
I know what to do.

546
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,480
You should use your brain more.

547
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:25,800
Who is behind all this?

548
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:30,280
How did they contact outside the island?

549
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,240
On the isolated island

550
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,400
on such a tight island,

551
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,760
except pigeons,

552
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,400
no one can escape.

553
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,360
Pigeon.

554
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,240
Did you see the pigeon?

555
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,080
Last morning,

556
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,720
the man who was sent to Mount Hugtang said

557
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,480
I saw a pigeon

558
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,520
I think I saw a pigeon.

559
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,080
Are you sure it's a pigeon?

560
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:50,240
The guards said it looks like

561
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,680
Did you see where it came from?

562
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:53,200
No.

563
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,000
He disappeared in the blink of an eye.

564
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,360
Pigeon.

565
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,600
Captain.

566
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,480
Are you suspecting someone on the island

567
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,240
using pigeons to communicate with the outside world?

568
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,640
We have been suspecting that

569
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,600
there was a communication in the village.

570
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:22,080
If it was a pigeon,

571
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,640
Of course.

572
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,560
The person who keeps the pigeon

573
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,360
is the biggest suspect.

574
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,360
Wait.

575
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,080
The clues of pigeons are very important.

576
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,240
Keep it a secret.

577
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,680
so that we can capture them.

578
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,120
Dismiss.

579
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,800
Dismissed.

580
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,520
Have a seat.

581
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:29,800
Sasaki.

582
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,680
Listen.

583
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,480
I need you to make

584
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,640
a secret operation plan.

585
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,480
We plan to lift the sea ban on April 12.

586
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,960
The expulsion period is five days.

587
00:32:39,920 --> 00:32:40,880
Special Forces Police Brigade

588
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,400
will organize all young men on the island

589
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:43,920
to the sea.

590
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:44,160
Save it for fishing.

591
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:44,560
Li Juhai.

592
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:45,120
Sit on the sea.

593
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:45,960
A tiger goes to the sea to catch a tiger.

594
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,040
The reason is

595
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:49,280
The Day is coming.

596
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:51,080
The entire island

597
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,240
To celebrate the Emperor's birthday,

598
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:56,080
lift the sea ban.

599
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,240
Remove the sea ban?

600
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,280
This will bring a lot of trouble.

601
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,320
The gangsters in Macau

602
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,200
will also

603
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,120
to contact these people on the sea.

604
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,000
is using them as bait.

605
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,040
It's best to write in the plan.

606
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,600
Yes, sir.

607
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,720
and give some information to Macao.

608
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,480
and hide

609
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,080
in Macau,

610
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,200
and those who often make trouble on the island.

611
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,520
Macau gangsters.

612
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:26,920
I'm going to

613
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,360
all at once.

614
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,160
Do you mean the sea?

615
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,600
Check a list of people

616
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,040
on the island.

617
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:41,360
All young men on the island

618
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,160
must be on this list.

619
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,120
Understood.

620
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:47,240
Now,

621
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,480
there are only the old, weak and children left on the island.

622
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:55,000
Then it'll be peaceful.

623
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:00,960
Indeed.

624
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,040
I want to see it too.

625
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:02,920
Sasaki.

626
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,280
Write a report yourself.

627
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,920
to the commander.

628
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,800
Just report to the others.

629
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:11,480
Don't leave any trace.

630
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,560
Understood.

631
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,600
Irigami.

632
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,280
Stay here. I have something to tell you.

633
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,960
I’ve arranged something tonight.

634
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,320
to invite Colonel.

635
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,040
Come with me.

636
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:42,719
Are you going to declare war against Colonel?

637
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,960
We are soldiers.

638
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:49,360
Soldiers can't go against their superiors.

639
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:50,679
Yes.

640
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,719
But...

641
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,239
my intuition tells me he's suspicious.

642
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,160
I believe in this instinct.

643
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:00,920
If you want to declare war,

644
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:02,480
you have to declare war with a smile.

645
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:07,760
Smile.

646
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,320
Let's go.

647
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:22,920
Come here.

648
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,480
Go to Fukuda Ping Chuan now.

649
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,280
Tell him to leave the best private seats

650
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,480
in the tavern.

651
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,000
Tell him

652
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,080
I'm going to invite

653
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,080
a distinguished guest.

654
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:38,240
Tell him to prepare more sake.

655
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,000
and bring a few women with good looks.

656
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,640
Yes.

657
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:46,080
Telecom.

658
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,800
Telecom.

659
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,600
Record it.

660
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,280
The one who called

661
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,200
Mr. Rongze.

662
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:57,000
Yes.

663
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,200
The garrison team

664
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,960
Two Macau smugglers were killed.

665
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,080
According to preliminary investigation,

666
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,560
both smugglers belong to...

667
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,160
an organization called Anlan Hall in Macau.

668
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,480
The purpose of smuggling to the island is unknown.

669
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,880
Please cooperate with the investigation.

670
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,880
Find out

671
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,600
in Macau.

672
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:24,480
The point is Anlan Clinic, Area 8 in Macau.

673
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:27,480
Please pay special attention to these people.

674
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:34,320
the contact information

675
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:39,720
of the Sansa Island.

676
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,120
This mission must be carried out secretly.

677
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:45,560
Yes.

678
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:54,720
I've been so busy lately.

679
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:56,720
Thank you.

680
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,680
I'm always confused.

681
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,680
The chief of Macau Special Class

682
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,280
of Macau Special Class.

683
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:05,680
We were classmates.

684
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,880
Later, we had our own duties.

685
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,880
Please ask him for help this time.

686
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:13,680
That's a good idea.

687
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,160
Get ready to go.

688
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:17,840
The show is about to start.

689
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,160
You need to smile.

690
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,680
Just smile?

691
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,400
That Colonel Takemichi

692
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,040
is from the palace.

693
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,880
have seen the world.

694
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,480
What is this?

695
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,640
A confession.

696
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,480
Suppressant?

697
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:37,560
This thing

698
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,360
in the battle.

699
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,840
The intelligence bureau police and the search bureau

700
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,120
It's often used.

701
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:53,200
Will his life be in danger?

702
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:53,880
No.

703
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:54,880
He will only

704
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:59,160
reveal all his secrets.

705
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,600
And they keep nagging.

706
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,400
You keep nagging.

707
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,880
Pour this into the wine today.

708
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:13,920
Remember.

709
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:18,520
pour it into the third cup.

710
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,080
The third glass.

711
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,360
I see.

712
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:38,160
Good evening.

713
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,480
Captain Oshima.

714
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,200
I've been waiting for you.

715
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,520
Please.

716
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,720
Thank you.

717
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,720
I've prepared the best wine today.

718
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,240
As you like.

719
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,480
My pleasure.

720
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,160
Captain Oshima.

721
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,400
The Commander said

722
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,640
you don't like drinking

723
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,320
nor women.

724
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,040
But why

725
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,120
buy me a drink today?

726
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:52,520
The commander just told you

727
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,160
I don’t like drinking.

728
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,520
but he didn't tell you.

729
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:56,480
I can drink a lot, right?

730
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,160
Cheers.

731
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,120
Cheers!

732
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,240
Colonel.

733
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:13,880
Yes.

734
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,560
I can't help reminding you.

735
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,680
your Chinese woman

736
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,320
is unreliable.

737
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,720
We Japanese women are reliable.

738
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,000
Cheers!

739
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,240
Come on.

740
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:39,760
Commissioner Shen.

741
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,560
Let's have a toast.

742
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:43,920
Thank you.

743
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,280
Sorry.

744
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:00,960
I

745
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,120
have thought it through.

746
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,120
I have to tell you.

747
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,480
the island and I

748
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:09,760
have connections.

749
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:18,920
A pigeon.

750
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:20,720
right?

751
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,320
Last night,

752
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,680
two of my men went back to Sankanma.

753
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:29,920
Today,

754
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,040
the island replied to me.

755
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,160
What happened?

756
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,080
They're all dead.

757
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,280
Where are they?

758
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:41,920
They're fine.

759
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,920
Only my two brothers died.

760
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,120
Maybe they are the people

761
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,480
you're looking for.

762
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,720
They're fine.

763
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:50,160
Fortunately,

764
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,760
my nephew and my niece are fine too.

765
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:54,760
Gosh.

766
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,640
I was so worried.

767
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,640
Colonel is from the palace.

768
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,720
Put it nicely.

769
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,480
Make it thinner.

770
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,680
Slightly.

771
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,080
It's too big.

772
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,360
Let me do it.

773
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,560
Line up properly.

774
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,080
Actors.

775
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:32,360
Oshima Hao Wood Dragon (Japan)

776
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:32,680
Wei, Chen, Shao, Tong,

777
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:33,640
Luo Zhiyong, Liao Wangwang.

778
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:34,920
