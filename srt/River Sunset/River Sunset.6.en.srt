1
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,410
Major Ferguson reporting.

2
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,240
Please, sit down.

3
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,840
I'm sorry, Major.

4
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,000
You may need to

5
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,360
stay here a few more days.

6
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,240
Why?

7
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,400
After the British withdrawal,

8
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,040
the Japanese have blocked

9
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,920
all our air routes to the China theater.

10
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,180
We're planning to establish a new route.

11
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,500
But I told them you're stranded here.

12
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:33,400
Colonel,

13
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,560
I must arrive before April 15th

14
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,200
in China.

15
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:36,560
We still have some time,

16
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,890
but we shouldn't delay.

17
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,079
Take a look at this map.

18
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,160
The only possible route

19
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,220
requires flying over the Himalayas.

20
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,680
Those mountains are up to 5 miles high.

21
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,160
Our planes can't fly that high.

22
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,200
We have no maps of that area,

23
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,600
no radio guidance,

24
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,680
and no clear idea of the actual weather conditions there.

25
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,000
Colonel,

26
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,600
you're making it sound like

27
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,130
our mission is impossible.

28
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,400
Don't give up yet, Major.

29
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,920
Our pilots are establishing

30
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,450
a route over the Himalayas.

31
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,940
You'll have to stand by until departure.

32
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,040
Seven-seven-zero-three,

33
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,400
prepare for takeoff on 250-meter runway.

34
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,840
Seven-seven-zero-three ready.

35
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,520
Seven-seven-zero-three, take off.

36
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,200
Well done, Jimmy.

37
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,400
I'm very pleased with

38
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,520
the performance of your pilots.

39
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:41,880
Colonel,

40
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,240
since you proposed this crazy idea,

41
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:45,300
we've certainly accomplished a lot.

42
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:47,160
At first, the boys were convinced

43
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,800
they were going to bomb Hitler.

44
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,240
That's fine.

45
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,240
We are considering bombing Hitler.

46
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:52,680
Jimmy,

47
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,560
Admiral Halsey will soon arrive in

48
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,800
San Francisco.

49
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,400
He wants

50
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,400
you to brief him about this mission.

51
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,240
Despite your impressive performance today,

52
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,240
the Navy isn't fully confident

53
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,600
that bombers loaded with fuel and bombs

54
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:08,400
can take off from an aircraft carrier.

55
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,560
I'd be happy to personally test fly on the carrier

56
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,280
to show the Admiral.

57
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,440
Good. You do that.

58
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,279
That would be the strongest proof.

59
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,320
I've heard

60
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,440
that your squadron's B-24s and B-25s

61
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,519
can't all fit

62
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,720
on the Hornet's deck.

63
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,200
That deck can only accommodate B-15s,

64
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,400
sixteen at best.

65
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,440
That's unfortunate.

66
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,800
With only sixteen planes,

67
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,000
we can't really do much damage to Tokyo.

68
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,520
Even with all the B-24s,

69
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,320
you couldn't do much damage either.

70
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:40,780
Listen,

71
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,000
the key to this mission is

72
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,360
to send a message to the Japanese,

73
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,280
not to cause major destruction.

74
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,560
Not everyone can be a hero.

75
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:51,080
Good pilots are needed for other missions too.

76
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,840
Those who can't participate in this mission

77
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,600
will be assigned to other operations.

78
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,850
Perhaps bombing Hitler in Europe.

79
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,050
Find a chance to tell everyone about this, would you?

80
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,360
Boys,

81
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:24,880
as of today,

82
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,200
the first phase of our training

83
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,360
is coming to an end.

84
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,280
I appreciate everyone's

85
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,760
efforts with the B-25s.

86
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,320
There's still a lot of work to be done.

87
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,120
Colonel, do you mean

88
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,880
adding another broomstick?

89
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:36,680
I bet

90
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,880
Hitler is already shaking in his boots.

91
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,080
Many of you have been asking me

92
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,740
what exactly this mission is.

93
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,040
I can only repeat what I've said before.

94
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,520
This mission is extremely dangerous.

95
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,920
You are not to tell anyone

96
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,050
what we're doing or where we're going.

97
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:54,880
Not even if your mother asks.

98
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,560
That means you.

99
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,640
This is all top secret.

100
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,440
I will tell you

101
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,700
what you need to know when the time comes.

102
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,480
Any questions?

103
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,960
No, sir.

104
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,560
Anyone who's hesitant,

105
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,400
anyone who's changed their mind,

106
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,530
tell me now and you can still withdraw.

107
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,320
Good.

108
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,120
Tomorrow, our squadron's B-24s

109
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,640
will all fly to

110
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,440
McClellan Field in Sacramento.

111
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,480
After the transfer,

112
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,960
our training mission

113
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,400
will focus on extremely short takeoffs.

114
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,520
A new crew of mechanics will be provided there.

115
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,640
Lawson, Cole,

116
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,080
I order you two to supervise them

117
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:39,560
and speed up our progress.

118
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,440
Yes, sir.

119
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,400
That's all.

120
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,240
Have a good evening, everyone.

121
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:43,840
All right.

122
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,880
Short takeoff.

123
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:49,720
What would you like to drink today?

124
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,640
Whiskey.

125
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,159
Sir.

126
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:55,690
Are you really going to Europe to bomb Hitler?

127
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,800
Hitler, Yamamoto, Mussolini.

128
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:58,360
Take your pick.

129
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,680
I'll personally fly you there to meet him.

130
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,010
You can jump out of the plane and say hello.

131
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,560
This drink's on me.

132
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,720
It's dinner time.

133
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:20,480
Guests may proceed to the dining room.

134
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,360
Miss Ye,

135
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,760
it's time for dinner.

136
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,900
Are you getting up?

137
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:33,800
What?

138
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:35,720
Well,

139
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,520
the announcement just now was that

140
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,240
dinner is being served on the ship.

141
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,440
Shall we go together?

142
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,040
After all, we're the only two Chinese people on board.

143
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,100
All right then.

144
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,600
Wait for me.

145
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,320
Hello.

146
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,730
What are you talking about?

147
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,240
This Fukuda

148
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,740
runs a trading company on the island.

149
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,360
From Tanjiawan to Shangbiao Village,

150
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,040
to the Air Force base and Navy dock,

151
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,500
he has stores everywhere.

152
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,040
Even the cigarettes Commander Fujita smokes

153
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,200
are supplied by him.

154
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,080
He named all his stores

155
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,800
New Nagasaki.

156
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:11,000
I believe he wants to someday

157
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,520
turn Sanzao Island into New Nagasaki.

158
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,440
That way he would be the supreme commander,

159
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:17,900
and General Fujita would be just one of his military officers.

160
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,680
I've got some new cigars

161
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,800
from the Shanghai Concession.

162
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,640
Let's go try them.

163
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,600
Let's go.

164
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,240
Let me tell you.

165
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,400
He

166
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:37,000
is the only one authorized by the island's Special Police Force

167
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,040
to run a comfort station.

168
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,520
He hired over twenty immigrants from Okinawa

169
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,600
as workers.

170
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:48,800
He sells everything from daily necessities to food.

171
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,200
Basically anything

172
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,600
that can be bought with money.

173
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,330
It's all related to him.

174
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,560
Miss Ye.

175
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,340
If you need anything on the island in the future,

176
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,400
you can come to me.

177
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,360
I have some connections here.

178
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:06,040
Thank you.

179
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:06,920
As for him,

180
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,960
he's backed by the Special Police Unit.

181
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,050
But he's just Oshima Hiroshi's

182
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,640
lapdog.

183
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,240
What brings you to the island this time?

184
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,560
I'm going home.

185
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,200
Home?

186
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,370
My home is on Sanzao Island.

187
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,840
My father is Ye Degong.

188
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,520
So you're Ye Degong's daughter.

189
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,840
You know my father?

190
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:37,480
Of course.

191
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,360
How is he?

192
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:40,840
He's fine.

193
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,560
He's doing well.

194
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,960
His health is excellent.

195
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:44,130
That's good.

196
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,800
I've heard that Ye Degong's daughter

197
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,840
was studying abroad.

198
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,960
That's you?

199
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,480
Commander Fujita

200
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,080
used to be in America

201
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,640
as an assistant military attaché.

202
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,840
Your father was a diplomat.

203
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,040
That's why Commander Fujita

204
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,970
enjoys chatting with your father.

205
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,920
But perhaps because the military

206
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,320
took over your family's mansion,

207
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,280
your father

208
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,210
has never been very enthusiastic.

209
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,480
What's your business?

210
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,680
I'm from the Maintenance Association.

211
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,520
Who sent you here?

212
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,440
Captain Inoue sent me.

213
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,000
Go on up.

214
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,200
Okay.

215
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,080
Chairman Tang.

216
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,200
Upstairs.

217
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,720
Captain Inoue.

218
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,480
Chairman Tang,

219
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,600
can you guarantee

220
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,530
your loyalty to the Imperial Army?

221
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,320
Captain Inoue,

222
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,120
I have always been

223
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,440
completely loyal to the Imperial Army.

224
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,370
That's not true.

225
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,000
You've been hiding many things.

226
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:56,960
No, no,

227
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:57,760
I haven't.

228
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,720
Absolutely not!

229
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,880
Recently,

230
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,860
we've received some reports.

231
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,120
In Shangbiao Village,

232
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,800
Tanjiawan Village,

233
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,680
and many other households,

234
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,240
there are hidden rooms.

235
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,360
Why haven't you

236
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,680
reported this to us?

237
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,160
Captain Inoue,

238
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,280
it's like this.

239
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,920
Not every household on this island

240
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,240
has a hidden room.

241
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,920
Poor families don't have hidden rooms.

242
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:40,480
Come up.

243
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,840
Captain Inoue.

244
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,440
You don't know,

245
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,800
this area used to have pirates.

246
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,570
The wealthy families on the island

247
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,480
when building their houses,

248
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,840
constructed secret rooms.

249
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,280
When pirates came,

250
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,280
they hid their valuables,

251
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:14,280
family members and food.

252
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,520
I understand.

253
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,080
So,

254
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:20,060
does the Tan family in the east village have one?

255
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,560
The one we met at the ancestral hall last time,

256
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,220
does the Chen family have one?

257
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,000
What about Mr. Ye? Does the Ye family have one too?

258
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:26,760
Yes, they do.

259
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,800
Then tell me,

260
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,360
these secret rooms of wealthy families,

261
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,220
where are they usually built?

262
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,320
I really don't know that.

263
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:48,160
I've heard some are built in attics,

264
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,040
while others are underground.

265
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,840
Secret rooms...

266
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,720
they must all be in hidden places.

267
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,360
Of course.

268
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,250
Does anyone on the island know about them?

269
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,800
No.

270
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,160
These wealthy families,

271
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,600
when building their secret rooms,

272
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,730
hired people from outside the island.

273
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,730
Island locals can't find them.

274
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,840
You know

275
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,920
the consequences of lying to me?

276
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,560
No,

277
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,280
I absolutely wouldn't dare.

278
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,120
Everything I've said is true.

279
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,000
Alright.

280
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:28,880
Today,

281
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,360
I called you here

282
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,320
because there's a very important matter

283
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,440
that your maintenance committee needs to handle.

284
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,280
A few days ago

285
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:42,800
we shot down an American aircraft.

286
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,640
There's still one person from the plane who hasn't been found.

287
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,600
Your maintenance committee should notify

288
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,200
all villagers on the island.

289
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,220
Anyone who provides information

290
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,440
will be rewarded by our Special Police Unit

291
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,680
with 50 jin of rice

292
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,280
and 20 jin of pork.

293
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:02,960
However,

294
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,000
If anyone knows something and doesn't report it,

295
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,800
or intentionally hides anyone,

296
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,010
the whole family will be executed.

297
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:13,440
Understood?

298
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,200
Under-

299
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,080
Understood.

300
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,680
Good.

301
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,640
Then

302
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,450
please proceed.

303
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,640
It seems there really are secret rooms on this island.

304
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,400
I truly admire you.

305
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,080
How did you know?

306
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:41,440
Even an old woman who just washes clothes and cooks

307
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,440
has a hidden underground chamber in her home.

308
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,840
Other households must have them too.

309
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,080
I see now.

310
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,800
This American who fell from the plane

311
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,440
either drowned in the sea,

312
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,640
with his hat washed ashore by the waves,

313
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:53,760
or

314
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,320
he's currently hiding

315
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,640
in a secret room in someone's home in the village.

316
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,080
That's why we couldn't find anything.

317
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,040
So you think

318
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,720
Ye Degong

319
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,640
is most likely hiding him in his house?

320
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,560
Among the island residents,

321
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,839
Only those who can communicate with Americans

322
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:13,839
are the Ye family

323
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,240
and a few wealthy households on the island.

324
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,160
But

325
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:20,960
it's not impossible.

326
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,000
So

327
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,640
I asked the Maintenance Association

328
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:26,160
to create a tense atmosphere first.

329
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:31,200
I'll lead another search of the village tomorrow

330
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,600
and dig out all their hidden rooms.

331
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,000
We certainly need to dig.

332
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:36,880
But right now

333
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,280
we haven't located the hidden rooms yet.

334
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,460
We must find the right moment.

335
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,840
First, have someone watch the Ye family closely.

336
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,520
Report immediately if anything suspicious is found.

337
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,980
Report to me immediately.

338
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,560
Goodbye.

339
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,520
We're almost there.

340
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,560
Yes.

341
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,560
Sound the alarm.

342
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:39,420
There's a mine!

343
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,800
What's going on?

344
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,320
What happened?

345
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,560
Look over there!

346
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,240
Mine!

347
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:51,480
Mine!

348
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,200
There's a mine!

349
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,920
Where is the mine?

350
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,080
What's wrong?

351
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:58,880
What is that?

352
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,640
Watch out for the mine!

353
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,200
Hard to port!

354
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,040
Turn left!

355
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,090
Hard to port!

356
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:16,960
There's a mine!

357
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,920
What do we do?

358
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,960
Thank goodness.

359
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,040
That scared me to death.

360
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,120
We're lucky.

361
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,400
It's such a relief it didn't explode.

362
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,280
We're safe now.

363
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,560
We've encountered enemy gunboats.

364
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,560
Organize resistance!

365
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:55,960
Don't let them get close.

366
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:56,880
Miss Ye.

367
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,320
Miss Ye.

368
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,440
Put your gun away.

369
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,200
Hurry! Go! The ship is sinking.

370
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,760
Base,

371
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,720
this is Yumaru.

372
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,840
We're under attack at 113 degrees east,

373
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,400
22 degrees north.

374
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,960
Less than 20 nautical miles from base.

375
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,160
Requesting backup.

376
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,200
Miss Ye.

377
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,200
Go! Hurry!

378
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,120
This person is a spy.

379
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,200
Miss Ye!

380
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,560
Miss Ye!

381
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:41,600
Miss Ye!

382
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,380
Don't panic. Wait for our rescue.

383
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,140
Don't panic. Wait for our rescue.

384
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,840
Don't panic.

385
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,160
Don't panic.

386
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,960
Wait for our rescue.

387
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,600
This is Fukuda.

388
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,480
The Coast Guard has an emergency.

389
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,680
Reporting to Captain Inoue of the Police Squad.

390
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,940
A spy has been discovered on the Amemaru.

391
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,620
Wait a moment, please.

392
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,680
That's Sasaki,

393
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,220
the police squad captain.

394
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,880
Is that your luggage?

395
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,450
He can't be waiting for you, can he?

396
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,280
I don't know.

397
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,440
Give me your gun.

398
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,400
I'll return it to you

399
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,480
when you're safe.

400
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,200
Hurry up.

401
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,280
Thank you.

402
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,360
Thanks.

403
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,600
Hello, Mr. Sasaki.

404
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,440
The interpreter is on board too.

405
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,760
Last night was rough.

406
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:37,560
Yes.

407
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,560
Is she Miss Ye?

408
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,280
He's asking if you're Miss Ye.

409
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,040
Come with us.

410
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,040
Colonel,

411
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,680
I'll escort you to the airport.

412
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,640
Attention, everyone!

413
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,160
The Special Police Unit announces

414
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,720
that anyone who discovers American pilots

415
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,360
must report to the police unit.

416
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,880
The police unit will reward you with

417
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,600
50 jin of rice and 20 jin of pork.

418
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,380
Everyone, pay attention!

419
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,000
The Special Police Unit announces

420
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,760
that anyone who discovers American pilots

421
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,360
must report to the police unit.

422
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,200
The police unit will reward you with

423
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,560
50 jin of rice and 20 jin of pork.

424
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,920
Those who withhold information

425
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,980
will be executed without exception.

426
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,360
Those in the back, move forward.

427
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,800
Come closer.

428
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,360
Come and look.

429
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,120
Let's hear what they have to say.

430
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,120
Alright.

431
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,440
Quiet.

432
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,440
Let me explain.

433
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,320
For informants,

434
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:13,280
50 jin of rice and 20 jin of pork.

435
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,960
For those who know but don't report,

436
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,960
what was it again?

437
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,280
The whole family gets executed.

438
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,000
Executed.

439
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,280
Attention, everyone!

440
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,520
If anyone spots American pilots,

441
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,440
you must report to the police unit immediately.

442
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,440
Mrs. Si,

443
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,560
is De Gong here?

444
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,240
Oh, it's Chairman Tang.

445
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,440
Why aren't you serving your Japanese masters?

446
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,770
What are you doing here?

447
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,360
I'm asking you,

448
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,720
is De Gong here or not?

449
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:47,840
What is it?

450
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:51,560
Let me in.

451
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,820
I have important news.

452
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:53,680
Hey, listen!

453
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,240
Don't go in!

454
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:54,800
Mrs. Si,

455
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,860
we can sweep later.

456
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,400
I really have important business with Mr. De.

457
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:58,640
It's urgent!

458
00:29:58,840 --> 00:29:59,360
Mrs. Si.

459
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:00,640
Sir!

460
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,240
Mr. De!

461
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,160
Chairman Tang.

462
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,240
What is it?

463
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,280
The police squad...

464
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:09,960
The Japanese said

465
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,440
that there's

466
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,260
an American on our island.

467
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,760
What does this American

468
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,880
have to do with us?

469
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:17,280
Exactly.

470
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,960
American or whatever.

471
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:19,480
Oh my!

472
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,080
This American

473
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,280
has nothing to do with our master.

474
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:21,720
Go.

475
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,040
Hey!

476
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,520
Auntie Si, don't stop me.

477
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,080
I really...

478
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,640
We need to discuss this.

479
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,920
Just go.

480
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,400
Oh dear!

481
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,080
Auntie Si,

482
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,680
let Chairman Tang in.

483
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,120
De Gong.

484
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,280
I need to tell you something.

485
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:45,410
Go ahead.

486
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,000
Where's

487
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,920
young master Longxia?

488
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,000
Chairman Tang, what is it

489
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,060
you want to tell me?

490
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:53,680
Yesterday,

491
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,920
that Inoue from the police squad asked me

492
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,520
if wealthy families on the island

493
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,280
have built secret rooms.

494
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,280
How did this Japanese man find out about this?

495
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,200
I wonder if it has something

496
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,440
to do with that American

497
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,040
who fell from the plane.

498
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:11,770
Did you tell them again?

499
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:12,840
De Gong,

500
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,120
I have no idea whether

501
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,380
our family has built a secret room or not.

502
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,560
I was thinking,

503
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:19,800
could you move

504
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,080
those valuables somewhere else?

505
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,880
Maybe bury them in the backyard.

506
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:25,440
This Inoue

507
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,320
is no fool.

508
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,720
We need to be careful.

509
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:31,960
I know.

510
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:32,560
Thank you.

511
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,340
I'll be going then.

512
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:49,720
Si Po,

513
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,480
tell Xia'er to come to the study.

514
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,080
Yes, master.

515
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:01,240
Commander, sir.

516
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,920
I am old now.

517
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,240
A wave of your hand brings spring,

518
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,100
a drop of your hand brings autumn.

519
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:09,320
I wish to return to my homeland,

520
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,280
to watch over my beloved wife's grave,

521
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,840
and live out my remaining years in peace.

522
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,400
Recently, your troops have been searching and disturbing,

523
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,600
it's truly unbearable.

524
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,680
Confucius said:

525
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:21,280
Those who command armies become rulers of men,

526
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,440
while all living beings are but maggots beneath their feet.

527
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,600
This means

528
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,800
that those who possess military power may become sovereigns.

529
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,240
But they treat the common people

530
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:32,160
as insignificant as insects.

531
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,320
Confucius also said:

532
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,840
Those who rule the people should first bind their souls,

533
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,600
imprison their bodies only when necessary,

534
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,840
and destroying their bodies is the lowest approach.

535
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,720
I have washed away the dust of years,

536
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,200
never abandoning my homeland,

537
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,520
seeking only to be left in peace,

538
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,920
living a simple life.

539
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,720
Ye Degong

540
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,440
Father, you wanted to see me?

541
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,080
Tang Bingchen just came to tell me

542
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,880
that the Japanese are asking him

543
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:01,160
about wealthy families building secret rooms on the island.

544
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,160
Who leaked this information to the Japanese?

545
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,760
It's not necessarily that someone informed them.

546
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,320
Wealthy families building secret rooms

547
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,760
is a local custom here.

548
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,600
Then we need to hurry

549
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,800
and move the Major to another location.

550
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,920
The Japanese don't know yet

551
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,770
the exact location of the secret room.

552
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,360
They're making noise all over the island now

553
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,520
trying to trick the Major

554
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,040
into walking into their trap.

555
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,600
But if they really go all out

556
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,120
and search every house thoroughly,

557
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,120
we won't be able to hide him for long.

558
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,320
I've written a letter to Fujita.

559
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,480
Take it to him immediately.

560
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,160
It might buy us a day or two.

561
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,240
What should we do next?

562
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,040
I'll figure something out.

563
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:41,640
Alright.

564
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,640
I'll go right now.

565
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,960
Room

566
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:50,440
Room

567
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,400
Ju

568
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,440
Mr. Ye

569
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,040
Mr. Ye

570
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,280
Who is it?

571
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:03,960
Mrs. Si

572
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:04,840
Is Mr. Ye home?

573
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:05,840
I have an urgent matter to discuss with him.

574
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,000
Oh, it's Translator Luo.

575
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:07,600
What's the matter?

576
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,130
It's urgent. Please hurry.

577
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,280
Sir.

578
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,600
Mr. Luo, what's the matter?

579
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:30,320
Mr. Ye,

580
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,679
your daughter has been arrested by the police.

581
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:33,840
What are you talking about?

582
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,679
My sister left the island a long time ago.

583
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:36,120
No,

584
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,440
have you ever met my daughter?

585
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,679
When you arrived,

586
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,400
my daughter was already gone from the island.

587
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,530
There's no mistake.

588
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,320
She came back on the same boat with me.

589
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,199
As soon as we landed,

590
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,000
she was taken away by the police.

591
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,800
Why would the police arrest her?

592
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:49,560
Well,

593
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,880
it's definitely true.

594
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:53,800
I need to get back to headquarters.

595
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,960
I can't stay long.

596
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,719
You'd better think of something quickly.

597
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,640
Hurry!

598
00:34:59,120 --> 00:34:59,920
Please wait.

599
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,520
Only Japanese people can come and go from this island.

600
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,120
How could Ying'er come back?

601
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,000
What do you think is going on?

602
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:10,320
I'm sure it's this guy

603
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,880
up to something with the Japanese.

604
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,740
I'll go ask him what's happening.

605
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,740
Don't be so impulsive.

606
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,080
Take this.

607
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,640
I'll go check.

608
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,680
Tell me the truth now.

609
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,120
Your real name,

610
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,080
occupation,

611
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,440
and mission.

612
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:34,520
Starting with your name,

613
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:35,920
your full name,

614
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:37,160
your position,

615
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,440
and your mission.

616
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,200
This bag belongs to you, doesn't it?

617
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,640
This is your purse.

618
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,240
Guards!

619
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:57,880
Yes.

620
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:00,760
Have Shanghai investigate

621
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,280
ID number 4906,

622
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,360
who got this woman

623
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,760
this special island entry permit.

624
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:07,600
Yes.

625
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,320
Is this your gun?

626
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,320
This is your gun.

627
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,720
I won't ask a second time.

628
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,960
I'll tell you once more.

629
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:35,400
Are these your bag and gun?

630
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,880
This is your gun and your bag.

631
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,000
How did you get to this island?

632
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:43,840
And who gave you the special pass?

633
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,370
How did you get here?

634
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,120
The permit.

635
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:48,250
First, find an ill-tempered officer.

636
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,180
He will hit you.

637
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,140
Insult you.

638
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,040
Threaten you.

639
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:54,020
Making you feel extreme psychological terror.

640
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,680
Your gun.

641
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,080
Take it.

642
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,840
Hold it properly.

643
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,920
This gun is yours, right?

644
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:07,720
This gun belongs to you, right?

645
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:10,440
This weapon is definitely yours.

646
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:11,240
Hold on.

647
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,120
Remember to stay silent.

648
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:16,210
I arrived on the island only 5 hours after you did.

649
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,280
Captain!

650
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,060
What are you doing?

651
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:23,850
Captain,

652
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,160
that woman is Mr. Ye's daughter.

653
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,040
I see.

654
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:35,160
So she's Mr. Ye's daughter.

655
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,960
Not from this island.

656
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:38,640
Yes.

657
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,540
That old man and his servant are outside.

658
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,560
Let's arrest him first

659
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,640
and let Sasaki handle it.

660
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,360
No need.

661
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,480
Call Sasaki over.

662
00:37:58,440 --> 00:37:59,320
Tell me now!

663
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,080
Captain.

664
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:12,180
Here's our chance.

665
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:15,000
Don't worry about things here.

666
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,360
Go to Ye Degong's house in Tanjiawan immediately.

667
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,890
Dig out the secret chamber.

668
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:18,890
Yes, sir.

669
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,400
Move aside.

670
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:39,640
Colonel.

671
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,170
May I have a word?

672
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:49,840
Look at this.

673
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:53,600
Your female assistant has been arrested.

674
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:56,520
It's a call from the Sanzao Island Special Police Unit.

675
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,240
They seem to have discovered

676
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,360
her special pass.

677
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,920
Something must have gone wrong.

678
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,520
Listen to me.

679
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,250
The operation is canceled.

680
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,320
Stay calm.

681
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,280
You must remain calm.

682
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,880
It will be dangerous.

683
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,010
What else did they find?

684
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:14,410
Nothing else so far.

685
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,090
Let me think.

686
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,040
This telegram arriving here

687
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:20,880
means she's been arrested

688
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,210
for more than two hours.

689
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:23,040
It will take me

690
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,570
another two hours by plane.

691
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,210
Let's go.

692
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,240
No.

693
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,680
Throughout the journey,

694
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,200
Wu Mu was reviewing

695
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:57,280
all his activities with Ye Biying in Shanghai.

696
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,320
He went through every step

697
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,840
of the island entry procedure with Ye Biying.

698
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,040
He examined every detail

699
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:06,440
that might have exposed their identities.

700
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,280
Wu Mu carefully reviewed

701
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,200
all activities in Shanghai.

702
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,360
From this, he concluded

703
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,040
that Ye Biying's arrest

704
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,680
must have been accidental.

705
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,400
Let's go somewhere else.

706
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:02,880
Captain.

707
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:03,680
Yes.

708
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,600
The special entry permit

709
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,640
for Ye Biying's island access

710
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,000
was issued by a colonel.

711
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,880
The Shanghai Garrison Intelligence Section

712
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:12,560
has already classified

713
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,960
these documents as confidential.

714
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:14,400
Therefore,

715
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,040
a regular investigation won't yield results

716
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,300
unless Commander Fujita signs off on it.

717
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,040
What a hassle.

718
00:41:22,040 --> 00:41:23,880
That stubborn old man.

719
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,600
What the hell?

720
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,240
We can use

721
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:29,200
the father of that woman we just detained,

722
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,400
but no torture.

723
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:51,800
How's it going?

724
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,060
Too impulsive. Idiot.

725
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,640
Did you see that woman's expression?

726
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,680
Look how she held her breath,

727
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,400
she even stopped breathing.

728
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,490
What does that mean?

729
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,400
It's a primal human instinct.

730
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,480
When trying to conceal or hide something,

731
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,760
this is the reaction.

732
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,200
When humans cannot fight back

733
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,840
or resist,

734
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:20,440
they try to hide.

735
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,880
That's why she responded this way.

736
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:23,960
In other words,

737
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,880
she felt extreme pressure.

738
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,720
Now we just wait for her.

739
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,920
Your psychological defenses are crumbling.
