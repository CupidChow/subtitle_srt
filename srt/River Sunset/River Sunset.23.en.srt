1
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:36,920
Colonel.

2
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,320
After them!

3
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:51,640
Move!

4
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,240
Go now!

5
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,320
Keep pursuing!

6
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,300
Don't let them escape!

7
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,200
The Colonel is wounded!

8
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,530
The Colonel's been hit!

9
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,200
Medic!

10
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,600
We need a medic!

11
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,560
Colonel,

12
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,079
are you alright?

13
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,560
Oshima,

14
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,010
what are you doing here?

15
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,400
The Commander sent me.

16
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,280
The Commander sent you?

17
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,880
The Commander was worried about you.

18
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,320
He ordered me to check on you.

19
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,520
I happened to arrive during the ambush.

20
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,520
Thank you.

21
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,290
Good thing you arrived in time.

22
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,120
By the way,

23
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,560
such a confidential operation,

24
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,280
even we didn't know about it.

25
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,120
How did we end up being ambushed?

26
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,079
Ambush?

27
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:17,880
Are you suggesting

28
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,400
they knew about our operation in advance

29
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,400
and set up an ambush here

30
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,800
waiting for us?

31
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:24,360
Isn't that obvious?

32
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,200
Akino.

33
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,650
Has our operation been leaked?

34
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,079
That's absolutely impossible.

35
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,960
Are you sure?

36
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,880
I guarantee it on my honor as a soldier.

37
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,340
We encountered the enemy.

38
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,120
If we had been ambushed,

39
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,920
we wouldn't have heard their gunfire beforehand.

40
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:49,160
Report.

41
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,400
Eight of our men are dead,

42
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,480
two severely wounded.

43
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,720
44 with minor injuries.

44
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,579
Captain Akino,

45
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,000
take your men to search the area

46
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,800
and prevent any counterattack.

47
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:57,770
Let's go.

48
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,720
Don't worry about me.

49
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,400
I'm fine.

50
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,530
Take care of the other wounded.

51
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,320
Radio operator,

52
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:06,320
report the situation to headquarters.

53
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,500
You should go back for treatment.

54
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,000
Let's go.

55
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,240
Thank you.

56
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,600
The rendezvous operation failed,

57
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,360
and the code wasn't delivered.

58
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:42,200
Oshima Hiroshi led the special police unit

59
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,400
that arrived in haste

60
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,400
and disrupted the entire plan.

61
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,120
Takeki, in his mind,

62
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,760
silently reminded himself

63
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
to stay calm.

64
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,400
The more troubled one feels,

65
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,850
the more one needs to remain composed.

66
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:59,480
It depends on relaxed muscles

67
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:03,120
and a slow, steady heartbeat.

68
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,170
Mother-in-law,

69
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,360
do we have any gauze and alcohol

70
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,420
for wounds at home?

71
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,159
There's still some left.

72
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:52,280
Could you get them for me?

73
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,520
Who's hurt?

74
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,840
Kewen.

75
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:55,720
Oh my!

76
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,560
This boy

77
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,000
is always getting himself hurt.

78
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,800
How did you hurt yourself again?

79
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,640
Okay.

80
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,160
I'll get it for you.

81
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,370
How big of a mistake did you make this time?

82
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,800
I...

83
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,320
You fired your gun without authorization.

84
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,580
Director Shen won't let you off the hook.

85
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:14,840
Alright.

86
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,040
I know you're scared.

87
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:16,840
About this matter,

88
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,080
I'll put in a good word for you with him.

89
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,240
He'll definitely give me

90
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,200
this small favor.

91
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,320
I...

92
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,860
Director Shen.

93
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:27,600
No.

94
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,800
He disobeyed orders and fired his weapon.

95
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,480
I've found the man responsible.

96
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,280
I'm making him kneel here as punishment.

97
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,540
Hurry up and apologize to Director Shen.

98
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,360
I'll teach him a lesson when we get back.

99
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,880
Shen.

100
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:42,720
No.

101
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,480
Take care of yourself.

102
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:42,799
Colonel.

103
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,880
I believe your purpose for coming to Huangyang Mountain

104
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,540
hasn't been achieved either.

105
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:49,760
After all, you encountered an attack

106
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,960
and suffered losses.

107
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,360
Thanks to Captain Oshima

108
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,420
who arrived with his men just in time.

109
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:02,920
As the police captain on this island,

110
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:03,880
protecting everyone's safety

111
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,160
is my responsibility.

112
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,660
It's the same for you, Colonel, isn't it?

113
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,640
Thank you for your special concern.

114
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,400
It's fine.

115
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,290
Where's Yinger?

116
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,320
I think she's with Wener.

117
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,160
I'll go look for her.

118
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,360
Little duckling,

119
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,200
with yellow feet,

120
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,760
quack, quack, quack.

121
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,040
Yellow feet,

122
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,760
flat bill.

123
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,480
Little duckling,

124
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,640
quack, quack, quack,

125
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,520
looking for mama.

126
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,520
I'll take you home.

127
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,520
Little duckling,

128
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,000
quack, quack, quack.

129
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,480
Little duckling.

130
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,960
Is that the song

131
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,600
Grandma taught you when you were little?

132
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,640
Grandma.

133
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:48,880
Are you hungry?

134
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,240
Yingying.

135
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,240
Little duckling.

136
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,320
Let's go home for dinner.

137
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,080
I'm not hungry.

138
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:53,960
Grandma,

139
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,720
I want to stay here for a while.

140
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,920
You can go back first.

141
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,040
Go ahead.

142
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,640
Yingying.

143
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,400
Tell Grandma,

144
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,720
is something bothering you?

145
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,600
Yingying.

146
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,640
Grandma understands you.

147
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,240
Tell Grandma the truth.

148
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,280
Are you falling for that Japanese guy?

149
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,280
Grandma.

150
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,640
Wumu is not a bad person.

151
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:09,880
Yingying.

152
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,600
Take this safety charm with you.

153
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,000
I don't understand other matters,

154
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,400
but I do know

155
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:25,720
no matter where you go,

156
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:32,040
staying safe is what matters.

157
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,400
I understand.

158
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,800
Thank you, Grandma.

159
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,120
They're back.

160
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,410
Grandma, I want to go check on them.

161
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,400
Please take Kewen home first,

162
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,240
okay?

163
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:52,800
I'll go back later.

164
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,240
Let's go home for dinner.

165
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,080
Let's go home.

166
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,850
The sun has already set.

167
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:06,760
Dinner time!

168
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,490
Time to eat. You must be hungry.

169
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,120
Let's go back with grandma for dinner.

170
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:10,920
Dinner's ready!

171
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,600
Let's go.

172
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,020
Time to eat.

173
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,240
This woman really has a thing

174
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,480
for our Major.

175
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:40,880
Captain.

176
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,600
Today, Major Rongze from Macau

177
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,960
sent us a telegram.

178
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,320
Major Rongze

179
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,840
captured someone

180
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,100
inside the Anlan Hall.

181
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,000
Excellent.

182
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,480
All our men are in the vehicle.

183
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,010
Shall we go back for a drink?

184
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,640
Inoue.

185
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,520
Tomorrow I plan to go to Macau

186
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,560
with Sasaki.

187
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,960
You'll be in charge here.

188
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,820
Going to Macau?

189
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,240
There's progress with the Macau situation.

190
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,480
Anlan Hall is actually

191
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,280
the Sanzao Island Association.

192
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:16,000
Macau people call them Ba Qu Zai.

193
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,680
In the past,

194
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,040
the disappearances of soldiers

195
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,320
and ambush incidents on the island

196
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,480
are closely connected to them.

197
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,640
During this trip,

198
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,560
we'll set some bait for them.

199
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,200
They'll take the bait.

200
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,400
I see.

201
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,720
Understood.

202
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,280
Let's go back.

203
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,160
Attention!

204
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,280
Forward march!

205
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,680
Are you all right, Colonel?

206
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,280
I'm fine. You may go.

207
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,280
Don't arrange any other

208
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,010
wounded soldiers in this ward.

209
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,560
Colonel,

210
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:35,960
there's still one empty bed in this ward.

211
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,480
The patient in this room

212
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,410
is a very important witness for me.

213
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,960
I must prevent him from having contact with anyone.

214
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,920
Move the empty bed to another room.

215
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,380
You two, come here.

216
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,120
Follow me.

217
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,800
You're hurt.

218
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,320
It's nothing.

219
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,560
Keep it.

220
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,410
Take it when you get the chance.

221
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,200
Don't worry about me.

222
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,900
Everything that needs to be taken

223
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,480
will be accounted for.

224
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:31,480
Fujita is here.

225
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,160
I need to go deal with him.

226
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,480
[Salutes]

227
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,400
You're injured.

228
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,800
Is it serious?

229
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,200
I'm fine.

230
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,760
but many soldiers in the anti-aircraft unit

231
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,720
are wounded.

232
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,280
Carry on.

233
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,480
Everyone, continue.

234
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,800
Casualties on the battlefield

235
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,120
are quite normal.

236
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,050
Don't feel bad about it.

237
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,600
What's the casualty report?

238
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,760
Reporting, Commander.

239
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,400
8 dead and 46 wounded.

240
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,280
Thanks to you, Commander,

241
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,040
for sending Captain Oshima ahead.

242
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,240
We managed to prevent more casualties.

243
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,920
I didn't send him there.

244
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,400
He went on his own.

245
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,680
But considering he helped get you out of trouble,

246
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,520
I won't hold it against him.

247
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,780
Let's go check on the wounded.

248
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,400
Stop.

249
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:03,840
Colonel Wumu.

250
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,770
Has Colonel Wumu returned?

251
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,010
Excuse me, has Colonel Wumu come back?

252
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,360
Don't move.

253
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,240
Let me in.

254
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:21,680
Step back.

255
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,640
Let me go in and see.

256
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,080
Step back.

257
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:23,520
I'll go check.

258
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,920
Is Colonel Wumu back yet?

259
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:26,720
Step back.

260
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,880
Is he injured?

261
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,120
Please let me in.

262
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,180
Go and announce me.

263
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,840
Let me in, please.

264
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,000
Step back.

265
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,680
Wumu.

266
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,000
Attention!

267
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,080
It's fine. Carry on.

268
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,640
Colonel,

269
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,360
your woman is shouting outside.

270
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,000
She seems very worried about you.

271
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,840
You should go see her.

272
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,000
General,

273
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,880
these people were injured because of my investigation.

274
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,760
I would like to accompany you

275
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,090
to offer them encouragement and comfort.

276
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,960
Alright.

277
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,480
Go to the hospital entrance

278
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,480
and bring the Colonel's woman inside.

279
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,280
Tell her the Colonel is fine

280
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:25,680
and ask her not to worry.

281
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:33,080
Stay back!

282
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,200
Step back!

283
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,280
Chief Guard.

284
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,680
The Colonel is waiting for you inside.

285
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,680
This way, please.

286
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:57,400
The Colonel is fine, please don't worry.

287
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,640
He's accompanying the General to comfort the wounded.

288
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,720
Sakamoto.

289
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,800
The injuries are more severe here.

290
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,080
Please take a look.

291
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,640
This way.

292
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,680
Are there any more wounded in this ward?

293
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,320
Commander, sir.

294
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,200
The wounded from the anti-aircraft battery

295
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,240
should all be gathered over there.

296
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,700
This isn't where they are.

297
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:55,240
Which unit sent this one?

298
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,360
Hey, Commander Fujita is asking you a question.

299
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:03,600
Sir.

300
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,360
This guy went to the village looking for women

301
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,080
and got every bone in his body broken.

302
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,240
His mouth is badly injured

303
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,520
so he can't speak.

304
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,400
Why does he get a private room?

305
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,320
This was

306
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,720
Dr. Kozu's arrangement.

307
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,080
Get Kozu here.

308
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,480
Commander,

309
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,200
the most urgent matter now is

310
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,240
the wounded men from the anti-aircraft unit

311
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,770
who need the best medicine.

312
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,320
Don't worry about that.

313
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,760
I'll call the Navy Department myself.

314
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,640
Go right now

315
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,880
and make a detailed list of medical supplies.

316
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,040
Yes, Colonel.

317
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,480
Sakamoto.

318
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,520
Tell Ozu

319
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,320
to move this guy out of the ward as soon as possible.

320
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,280
Akino.

321
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:56,610
Write me a report about today's incident.

322
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:01,920
Colonel.

323
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,520
Let my car take you home.

324
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,560
You've had a tough day.

325
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,880
And you're injured.

326
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,760
Go home and rest.

327
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,480
Commander.

328
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,360
With so many casualties in the anti-aircraft unit today,

329
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:13,920
I'd like to walk alone.

330
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:16,480
Casualties are normal during wartime.

331
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,740
Don't take it to heart.

332
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,890
I just remembered someone is waiting for you.

333
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,600
Do as you wish then.

334
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:15,880
I'm sorry, Colonel.

335
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,600
Get out.

336
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,530
Stand guard outside. Don't let anyone in.

337
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:33,560
The mission failed.

338
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,280
I couldn't deliver the package.

339
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,480
We can send it again.

340
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,000
I'm just glad you're safe.

341
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,960
How bad is your injury?

342
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,600
Who bandaged you like this?

343
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,320
But...

344
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,280
Didn't you promise you'd come back safely?

345
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,200
You'll take good care of yourself.

346
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,760
The bullet meant for you hasn't

347
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,360
been made yet, has it?

348
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,640
Very good.

349
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,600
Great performance.

350
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,680
Excellent acting.

351
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:33,920
You know what?

352
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,760
This is the best performance

353
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,400
I've seen since I met you.

354
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,240
But you don't need to act anymore.

355
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:43,920
I've posted someone at the door.

356
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,120
No one will come in.

357
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,540
When I was at Huangyang Mountain,

358
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,920
Oshima Hiroshi suddenly appeared

359
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,200
behind me with his men.

360
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,480
I had no warning at all.

361
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,960
There wasn't any prior warning?

362
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,560
None.

363
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:20,920
This man

364
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,820
is truly frightening.

365
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,000
It's been a long time since I've encountered someone this troublesome.

366
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:31,360
Are we in danger?

367
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,960
We just need to be extra careful.

368
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,920
What should

369
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,520
we do next?

370
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,280
I'll quickly treat my wound

371
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,600
and then take you home.

372
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,760
I think this time

373
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,240
we finally taught

374
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,640
that arrogant fellow from the palace a lesson.

375
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,040
Is that so?

376
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,760
This major

377
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,160
is just

378
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,480
a showoff who only knows fancy moves

379
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,720
and doesn't know how to fight at all.

380
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,480
We received information from the Rong Agency in Macau

381
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,800
about a mysterious figure from the Military Statistics Bureau

382
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,480
rushing back to Zhongshan.

383
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:55,360
At this time, Major Wumu

384
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:00,520
also brought people into Zhongshan territory.

385
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,240
And then there was

386
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:06,040
the encounter at the Huangyang Mountain crash site.

387
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:10,160
It's indeed too much of a coincidence.

388
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:12,320
A coincidence?

389
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,560
I suspect

390
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,080
that this attack

391
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:20,840
was definitely based on intelligence they received beforehand.

392
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,280
The information has been leaked.

393
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,400
That's possible.

394
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:32,960
Inoue,

395
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,840
tell Sasaki

396
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:37,570
to go to the headquarters' communications room.

397
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,200
Check what telegrams Colonel Takeki sent

398
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,530
before this operation.

399
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:42,520
Find out quietly.

400
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,160
Don't alert the commander.

401
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:46,600
I understand.

402
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,800
After that,

403
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:52,920
when it's done,

404
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,650
come to my office for a meeting.

405
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:23,040
De Gong.

406
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,480
Early this morning,

407
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,719
the police unit sent someone to register.

408
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,320
They said they need to verify

409
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,719
the vessels going to sea and the headcount.

410
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:34,679
I've been worried sick.

411
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,980
Translator Luo hasn't returned yet.

412
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:37,920
So I had to

413
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,840
come to you for advice.

414
00:34:39,840 --> 00:34:41,360
What should we do?

415
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,800
This is the

416
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,120
list drafted by the police unit.

417
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,520
There are 261 people in total.

418
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,679
Why is Xia'er on this list?

419
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,200
He doesn't even know how to fish.

420
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,040
And also,

421
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,200
These few

422
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,880
these children don't know how to fish either.

423
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,340
Why are they all included?

424
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,560
This was compiled by Oshima Hiroshi

425
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,040
according to the island's

426
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,300
list of young and middle-aged laborers.

427
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,920
But Mr. De,

428
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,600
there's something I find quite strange.

429
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:18,720
We're supposed to set sail in mid-April.

430
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,880
Isn't it a bit too early now?

431
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,480
This matter,

432
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,460
are you in charge of organizing this too?

433
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,360
Bingchen,

434
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,040
I understand you.

435
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:38,540
You originally wanted to be a gentleman,

436
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,650
but you were confused by external circumstances

437
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:43,940
and manipulated by the Japanese.

438
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,000
Now

439
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,000
you've been labeled as a villain by the villagers.

440
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,360
Good people are like raw talent.

441
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,640
A gentleman is like uncut jade

442
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,120
that must be carefully carved

443
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:01,680
to gain the villagers' approval.

444
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,160
I understand.

445
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,800
About this sea voyage,

446
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,120
it seems

447
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,560
like a good thing on the surface.

448
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,090
There's no apparent issue.

449
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,680
But I think

450
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,080
we should still be cautious.

451
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,380
The Japanese aren't that simple.

452
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,400
Just stall on this matter for now.

453
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,400
Wait until Translator Luo returns,

454
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,090
then feel things out

455
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,920
before making a final decision.

456
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,760
Okay.

457
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,280
Bingchen.

458
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,240
Rectify your heart,

459
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:36,370
be true to heaven and earth,

460
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,960
honor your ancestors.

461
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,930
Both of us should live this way.

462
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,120
Mr. De,

463
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,120
I understand.

464
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,920
I'll take my leave now.

465
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,840
Where are you going?

466
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,480
Xiang'er.

467
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:39,280
Xiang'er.

468
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,920
Master Duo is here.

469
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,520
Do you know where to deliver it?

470
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,380
Yes, I'll bring it to you shortly.

471
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,040
Master Duo.

472
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:47,920
Master Duo.

473
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,400
Long time no see.

474
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,600
Where have you been?

475
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,840
I'm here to see you now, aren't I?

476
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,000
Honestly,

477
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,160
I've been waiting for you for ages.

478
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,000
Room 3 is occupied.

479
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,880
Room 4 guests, please come in.

480
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,080
Room 4.

481
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,480
Room 4, two qian of opium.

482
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,600
Room 5 is occupied.

483
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,640
Room 6 guests, please come in.

484
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,280
Lily.

485
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,040
Room 6.

486
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,400
Room 6, three qian of opium.

487
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,720
Coming.

488
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,200
Who are you people?

489
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,960
Let me go! Let me go!

490
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,360
Japanese!

491
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,360
You've got the wrong person.

492
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,240
Get out.

493
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:05,120
This IOU from Wynn Casino is yours, isn't it?

494
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,080
So what if it is?

495
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,920
You're exactly who we're looking for, Mr. Duo.

496
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,160
This IOU is now in our possession.

497
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,760
Mr. Rong has ordered

498
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,800
that either we get the money back today

499
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,320
or we take one of your hands.

500
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,600
Your choice.

501
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,120
Go ahead.

502
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,280
What's wrong?

503
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:37,160
Don't like this one?

504
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:41,170
Let's try the other one.

505
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,360
Mr. Duo.

506
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:50,560
I heard you have six concubines at home,

507
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,200
each prettier than the last.

508
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:59,480
Let me go!

509
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,800
This girl isn't bad either.

510
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:11,840
He's done for.

511
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,360
We're even now.

512
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,920
No rush.

513
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,840
No one's coming out of Room 2.

514
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,810
Guest number 7, please come in.

515
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,520
This way, please.

516
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,920
Damn you!

517
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,040
Let go!

518
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,100
If you've got the guts, just shoot me.

519
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,120
Mr. Duo

520
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,360
You should recognize this little thing.

521
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,640
It seems to be one of your kind.

522
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,680
Get to the point.

523
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,300
About what I just discussed with you,

524
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,920
have you thought about it?

525
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,540
What are you doing?

526
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,060
What are you doing?

527
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,560
Let go!

528
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:18,920
Mr. Duo.

529
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,560
You're all taking off men's clothes?

530
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,200
I heard rats like to dig holes.

531
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:26,480
I want you to help me test something.

532
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:37,560
Will this little rat

533
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,280
bite this metal sheet

534
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,280
or

535
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:49,320
prefer to bite the belly of a big rat like you?

536
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,360
Japanese devil.

537
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:05,560
Let go!

538
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:06,800
Release me!

539
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,840
I said let go of me!

540
00:42:08,840 --> 00:42:11,720
Let go!

541
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:22,080
I agree.

542
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:24,280
I agree!
