1
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:34,960
Get him!

2
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,380
Let's go. Let's go.

3
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,600
There are many people in the hotel.

4
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,600
It’s hard to do it.

5
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:40,920
You wait on the way.

6
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,039
When these two show up,

7
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,729
and shoot them to death.

8
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,700
Yes, sir! Yes, sir!

9
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:48,880
Geng.

10
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,360
I'll take them there.

11
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,960
You must succeed.

12
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,890
Failure is not allowed.

13
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,560
Go!

14
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,680
Macau Wing Institute.

15
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,360
My deputy captain, Ishigami Kamakura.

16
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,200
died suddenly last night.

17
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,400
Please inform Captain Oshima Hao.

18
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,880
Go back to the base now.

19
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,720
Come in.

20
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,280
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

21
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:56,920
Oh, Samkakuma!

22
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,280
Airport 6.

23
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,740
A telegram from the Special Forces Brigade.

24
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,520
The Deputy Captain of the Police Brigade

25
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:08,520
died last night.

26
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,560
Go to the Grand Hotel right away.

27
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,490
Give this telegram to Oshima-san.

28
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,200
I'm going to the hotel.

29
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,000
Go.

30
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,960
Their base

31
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,800
is really troublesome.

32
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,560
It's almost time.

33
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,960
Come in.

34
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,960
Coming.

35
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,570
Captain Oshima!

36
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,420
Your telegram.

37
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,640
When did it come?

38
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,480
I just received it this morning.

39
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,720
What happened?

40
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,120
Irigami is dead.

41
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,159
No way!

42
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:48,800
Sasaki.

43
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:52,159
Let's go back now.

44
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:53,960
Yes!

45
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,520
Yamaguchi!

46
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,960
The meeting this morning

47
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,800
this morning.

48
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,800
We have to go back.

49
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,360
Please explain

50
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,400
to Colonel Rong.

51
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,520
Please rest assured.

52
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,960
We will do our best.

53
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,080
Let me give you a ride.

54
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:10,680
No need.

55
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,520
Let's go. Okay.

56
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,400
Okay.

57
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,520
Let's go.

58
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,760
Oshima Hao.

59
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,840
Let's go.

60
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,920
Get to work.

61
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,640
Can I use your phone?

62
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm looking for Mr. Rong.

63
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,200
Yamaguchi!

64
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,520
You're just in time.

65
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:04,960
The Eighth District boys

66
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,480
to assassinate Oshima-san.

67
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,760
Take the action team.

68
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,600
Hurry up!

69
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,520
Yes!

70
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,600
All units, gather!

71
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,840
Fall in!

72
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,000
Hurry up!

73
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,880
Excuse me.

74
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,600
Stop!

75
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,120
Let's go.

76
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,320
Something happened!

77
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,520
Run!

78
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,200
Stop looking. Let's go.

79
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,320
No bullets.

80
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,840
I won't bully you.

81
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,480
Don't use guns.

82
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,560
Come out.

83
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:48,280
These people

84
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,200
came from Sambu Island.

85
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,280
Let's go.

86
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:14,920
Go!

87
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,480
Captain Oshima!

88
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,480
Are you okay?

89
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,520
We need an emergency kit.

90
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,360
No need.

91
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,480
Who are they?

92
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,200
They are all from Anlan Hall.

93
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,330
Don't worry, Habha.

94
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,960
I won't let them off.

95
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,480
Let me send you there.

96
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,200
No need.

97
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,010
We'll go back by ourselves.

98
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,640
Go!

99
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,680
I'll stop them.

100
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,480
Run!

101
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:51,760
Stop!

102
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,560
Dad.

103
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,760
I'm back.

104
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,480
It's time to eat.

105
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,680
Ju.

106
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,330
What are you doing here?

107
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,580
I've been waiting for you.

108
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Why?

109
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,880
I have something to tell you.

110
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,720
I have nothing to tell you.

111
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,040
Ju.

112
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,080
Why are you so slow?

113
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:04,960
How dare you!

114
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,280
Tell me.

115
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,960
How long are you going to

116
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,420
How long are you going to keep pestering her?

117
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,480
What did you say that day?

118
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,400
If you were a man,

119
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,800
even if you fart,

120
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,720
even if you fart.

121
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,680
You're not going to roll?

122
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:27,820
Let me tell you.

123
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,720
I did this in front of Mr. De.

124
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:32,360
in front of De Gong.

125
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,020
I don't think today is necessary.

126
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,400
You punk.

127
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,660
Are you leaving or not?

128
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,420
Are you leaving or not?

129
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,120
Are you coming?

130
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,600
Are you coming?

131
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,280
No.

132
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,000
No.

133
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,040
Dad!

134
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,100
Stop fighting!

135
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,300
What do you want to say?

136
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:03,840
Say it.

137
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,970
Let's talk outside.

138
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,360
Ju, you can't leave.

139
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,120
Don't go.

140
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,940
What are you doing?

141
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,160
Dad.

142
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,820
I'll talk to him and come back.

143
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,320
Everyone standby.

144
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,320
Come in.

145
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,200
How did it go?

146
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,520
Is Captain Oshima Hao safe?

147
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,920
Captain Oshima is safe.

148
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:05,640
But

149
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,700
his assistant was slightly injured.

150
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,850
Did they all go back?

151
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,080
Don't worry.

152
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,560
They've returned safely.

153
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:17,640
Yamaguchi!

154
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,040
The attack at the dock...

155
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,920
was done by the rat of Anlan Hall.

156
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,080
I know.

157
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,640
The Dispatch Team is standing by.

158
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,520
Should I bring someone

159
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,580
to bring them back?

160
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,500
Let them dismiss and rest.

161
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,760
We got the news in advance this time.

162
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,480
It's all thanks to the rat.

163
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,880
I see.

164
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,600
These guys

165
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,400
are really troublesome.

166
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,480
Your Excellency, you're here. You're here. You're here.

167
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,880
before he left, he asked me

168
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,320
to tell you

169
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,680
about what we discussed yesterday.

170
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:49,340
what we discussed yesterday.

171
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,480
Captain Oshima is very meticulous.

172
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,920
He won't make a false accusation.

173
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,200
Find time

174
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,040
Go find the rat.

175
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,040
and find out

176
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,720
Find this contact channel.

177
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,400
Don't talk about anything else.

178
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,040
Yes.

179
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:24,760
Ju!

180
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,360
Ju!

181
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,000
Listen to me.

182
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,880
Didn't you say

183
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,700
you won't look for me anymore?

184
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:43,240
Okay.

185
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,540
What do you want to say?

186
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:47,400
Say it.

187
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:49,880
Ju.

188
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,400
Actually,

189
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,080
what I told your father that day

190
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:54,720
Actually,

191
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,450
I've liked you since I was a kid.

192
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,680
You know,

193
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,960
I'm happy to see you.

194
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,480
I can do anything for you.

195
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,960
or even die for you.

196
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,319
But what you said

197
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:13,319
what you said to my father yesterday

198
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,480
made me understand

199
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,920
you don't care

200
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,520
our engagement.

201
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:25,819
I understand how you feel.

202
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:27,839
Go.

203
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:29,480
Stop looking for me.

204
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,000
Ju, I'm sorry.

205
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,240
It's all my fault.

206
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:32,840
It's my fault.

207
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:33,640
It's my fault.

208
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,930
I put you in danger again and again.

209
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,480
It's all my fault.

210
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,660
You don't have to apologize to me.

211
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,540
I don't need your apology either.

212
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,920
I don't regret

213
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,050
doing those things for you and Ying Er.

214
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,400
I'm a Chinese

215
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,620
I'm from Sanbu Island.

216
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,600
I also understand the righteousness of the nation.

217
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,800
right and wrong.

218
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,480
My father

219
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,680
to protect my life

220
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,560
and work for the Japanese.

221
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,120
I can give up my life

222
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,300
to get rid of the Japanese.

223
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,160
Ju.

224
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,400
You did it.

225
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,040
You did very well.

226
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:19,760
People will die sooner or later.

227
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,760
But until yesterday,

228
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,840
I realized

229
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,200
that death is so close to me.

230
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:30,840
Ju.

231
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,520
Let's forget all those devils.

232
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,160
and forget

233
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,620
forget everything, okay?

234
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,920
Do people have signs

235
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,080
before they die?

236
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,240
In another world,

237
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,960
Calling another person.

238
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,840
Will he hear me?

239
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,120
Ju, listen to me.

240
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,760
The loneliest

241
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,880
and hardest days

242
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,080
has passed.

243
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,200
Hang in there.

244
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,480
We must have the courage

245
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,880
to live.

246
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:12,810
Brother Dragonfly.

247
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,600
I know.

248
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,560
you have an unsettled heart.

249
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,200
Once you leave this island,

250
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,320
your dream will set sail.

251
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,600
Those Japanese

252
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,760
and the police force

253
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,600
are not in your eyes.

254
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,320
But these are not what I want.

255
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,560
I just want an ordinary shoulder

256
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,480
to have a shoulder to lean on.

257
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:45,760
hoping to have a small home.

258
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:54,920
Ju.

259
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,880
In my life,

260
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,280
in my life.

261
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,800
The first thing is

262
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,560
when I was three,

263
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,840
my parents adopted me

264
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,480
and gave me a home.

265
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,720
The second thing is

266
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,920
I met you

267
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,760
and let me know

268
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,080
in the world.

269
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,660
She was not afraid of death for me,

270
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,840
and live a hard life.

271
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,240
I know what you're worried about.

272
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,120
Are you afraid

273
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,200
won't be blessed by your father?

274
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,960
Actually, it's not easy for your father.

275
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,560
He did all this for you.

276
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,760
I just don't like his identity.

277
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,000
And his attitude

278
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,720
in front of the Japanese.

279
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,560
But I can't change him.

280
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,760
As long as I marry you,

281
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,200
your father will be my father.

282
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,480
I can make him change.

283
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,520
As long as he doesn't do bad things for the kid,

284
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,380
I can put up with everything else.

285
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,320
What did you

286
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,640
What did you say?

287
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:03,960
Ju.

288
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,920
I will marry you.

289
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,120
I've been waiting for this.

290
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,520
I think

291
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,800
for a lifetime.

292
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,480
Look.

293
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,200
Over there.

294
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,720
Great.

295
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,360
Let's go.

296
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,770
What's there to be happy about?

297
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:53,520
The lovers are finally together.

298
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,080
Of course I'm happy.

299
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,080
Love is not necessarily a good thing.

300
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,240
One more concern

301
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,880
and more danger.

302
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,840
I think it's just a troubled world.

303
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:04,880
because

304
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,540
That's why they are together.

305
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,180
When you love someone,

306
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,600
you'll be more powerful

307
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,400
and braver.

308
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,450
and more promising.

309
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,890
From another perspective,

310
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,720
they will be more scared.

311
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,480
and everything they have now.

312
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,120
to make them weak

313
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,650
when facing things.

314
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:25,800
and panic.

315
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,640
Let them live in despair

316
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,810
because of this hopeless fate.

317
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,800
You win.

318
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:33,720
But I think

319
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:37,040
love is the greatest emotion of human beings.

320
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,520
is the greatest thing

321
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,080
in the world.

322
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,560
Look.

323
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,040
At least they are the happiest people

324
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,760
in the world.

325
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,760
Am I right?

326
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,400
Ichiro Takemichi.

327
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,220
Don't you have love in your heart?

328
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,640
If what you said

329
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,480
a relationship between a man and a woman,

330
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,720
I'm glad I didn't.

331
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,080
I'm glad.

332
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,360
How pathetic.

333
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,360
Do we have to

334
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,600
should we respect our lives?

335
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,280
Yes.

336
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,850
So there's no boundary to save people, right?

337
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,200
No.

338
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,040
Being a nurse in a Japanese hospital

339
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,880
That's a way to save life.

340
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,960
Right?

341
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,120
Yes.

342
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,520
Being a nurse in a Japanese hospital

343
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,120
won't tarnish your reputation, right?

344
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,720
No.

345
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,320
But keep the meeting going.

346
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,000
You understand everything.

347
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,160
You said it so clearly.

348
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:08,920
and straightforward.

349
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,050
Don't I understand?

350
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,540
What are you trying to say?

351
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:14,960
I...

352
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,520
Think before you talk.

353
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,280
I want to marry her.

354
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,200
I want to marry Ju.

355
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,320
Do you agree?

356
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:01,720
Xia,

357
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,840
these years

358
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,080
is the darkest day on the island.

359
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,480
Only when you're with Ju,

360
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,840
is the happiest day for you.

361
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,080
Now,

362
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,600
Just think about

363
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,000
and do it.

364
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,880
I will respect your choice.

365
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:33,920
Thank you, Dad.

366
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,120
Okay.

367
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,600
Go talk to your mom.

368
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:43,400
Here.

369
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,080
There.

370
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,240
Where are you going?

371
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,080
Mom.

372
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,600
I want to marry Ju.

373
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,920
Can you bless me?

374
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,400
Lord De.

375
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,480
Good news.

376
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,920
Mr. De.

377
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:45,600
What's the matter?

378
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,480
You look so excited.

379
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,520
This is great news.

380
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,280
Since the Japanese came to the island,

381
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,000
from the Japanese?

382
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:57,040
The Japanese

383
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,360
a maintenance meeting

384
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,690
a maintenance meeting?

385
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:01,880
The president of the maintenance club.

386
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,040
Let me do it.

387
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,720
Look.

388
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,520
The wedding date of Ju and Xia

389
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,000
can be held as usual.

390
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,280
From now on, the Japanese

391
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,850
won't touch us anymore.

392
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,400
Maybe

393
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,120
protect us.

394
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,960
A country is in danger.

395
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,420
Everyone is responsible.

396
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,360
But Lord De is old.

397
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,360
I couldn't expel the tiger out of China.

398
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,000
Every time I think of this,

399
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,360
I feel guilty.

400
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,840
Only one breath left.

401
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,200
What we can do is

402
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,140
Straighten your legs and straighten your back.

403
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,260
You won't disgrace the loyal spirit of the Sanbu Tribe.

404
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,120
Bingchen.

405
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,920
I should call him Chairman Tang.

406
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,040
You and I

407
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:06,720
We have different paths.

408
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:07,880
From now on,

409
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,400
go our separate ways.

410
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:11,840
No.

411
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:13,880
Lord De,

412
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,140
The engagement of those two children...

413
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,240
Marriage?

414
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,560
Don’t mention it again.

415
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:44,920
Captain!

416
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:47,290
Captain Oshima!

417
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:47,920
How did you get hurt?

418
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,840
It's none of your business.

419
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,520
How's the situation over there?

420
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,080
I think it was a car accident.

421
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,040
Is the scene still there?

422
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:53,040
We didn't dare to handle the scene.

423
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:53,560
to protect the scene.

424
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,280
We'll wait for you to come back.

425
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:54,960
Sasaki.

426
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,240
Go to the hospital first.

427
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,280
Take him to the hospital.

428
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,440
Thank you.

429
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,480
Even dogs don't come here.

430
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,840
What is he doing here?

431
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,400
I don't know.

432
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,360
Is Lieutenant Ikegami drunk again?

433
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:22,800
He drove here.

434
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:41,600
Captain.

435
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,080
You're finally here.

436
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:50,160
Captain.

437
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,240
You don't look well.

438
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,600
Don't go down.

439
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,480
Go away.

440
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,200
Captain.

441
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,280
Are you sure it's the well?

442
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:18,920
Yes.

443
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,480
The clothes are basically burnt out.

444
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,320
The ID is under the body.

445
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,050
Hey, what about your ID?

446
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,760
This is the only thing left.

447
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,560
The car number is right.

448
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:38,320
I'm pretty sure it's Lieutenant Ikegami.

449
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,040
Did you look around?

450
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,300
Did you find anything?

451
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,840
We've checked.

452
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,040
The road up the mountain is stone road.

453
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:47,960
There are no traces left.

454
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,720
We've searched everywhere.

455
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:51,120
We didn't find anything.

456
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,680
Captain.

457
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,480
Can you figure out

458
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,920
if he died after falling here

459
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,720
or was he moved down after he died?

460
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,980
This needs an autopsy.

461
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,000
If Captain Irigami

462
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,930
fell off the cliff after his death,

463
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,400
and the motorcycle started a fire.

464
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,000
his organs and chest

465
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:11,920
will never inhale the smoke.

466
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:14,260
Can you confirm the time of death?

467
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:15,600
We can find it too.

468
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,600
Okay.

469
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:20,120
Get the body back for an autopsy.

470
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,480
Find out everything.

471
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,920
Okay, we'll try our best.

472
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,480
My intuition tells me

473
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,880
it wasn't an accident.

474
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,160
Hey, Sasaki! Hey!

475
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:55,960
Yes.

476
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,040
How's your injury?

477
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,400
Do you need some rest?

478
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:01,000
It's okay.

479
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,480
Captain.

480
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,120
Don't be too sad.

481
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,480
Sasaki! Sasaki!

482
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,560
Do you think

483
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,840
had a car accident?

484
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,370
Who would believe that?

485
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,290
In the past few days,

486
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,320
we've encountered too many things.

487
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,080
If it wasn't a car accident,

488
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,920
there must be a first scene.

489
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,920
Where is the first scene?

490
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,680
I don’t think it’s hard.

491
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:46,480
As long as we find out

492
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,940
what happened yesterday,

493
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,480
If we follow his route,

494
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,850
we should be able to find the scene.

495
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,760
Let's wait for the doctor's conclusion.

496
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,640
People's eyes are fire.

497
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,640
mouth and ears are water.

498
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,960
The nose is earth.

499
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,600
The forehead is wood.

500
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,200
You're glaring.

501
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,720
You're too angry.

502
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,960
you'll be doomed in the future.

503
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,000
What are you talking about?

504
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,760
This half-fairy is quite accurate.

505
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,610
There is indeed a disaster.

506
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:38,360
or a fire?

507
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,020
What are you murmuring about?

508
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,160
Do you remember

509
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,280
the half-fairy that we caught last time?

510
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,760
When he saw Captain Irigami,

511
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,600
Captain Irigami's forehead is dark.

512
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,240
Something might happen.

513
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:57,640
He said his eyes were too hot

514
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,280
he would die in a fire.

515
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:03,400
We only thought he was talking nonsense.

516
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,000
I didn't expect you to be so accurate.

517
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,800
Sasaki.

518
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,159
As a soldier of the empire,

519
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,620
How can you trust Chinese?

520
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:10,360
Believe these?

521
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,159
ridiculous superstition.

522
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:14,600
I was foolish.

523
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:16,840
Besides,

524
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:19,840
we're not sure

525
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,400
how the well died.

526
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,159
You're right.

527
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:26,679
Where is that half-fairy

528
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,040
is now?

529
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:32,300
He's still locked up by us.

530
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:38,800
I really

531
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,929
forget this person.

532
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,600
That bastard!

533
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,570
How dare he curse my subordinates?

534
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,280
You're spreading false rumors.

535
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,639
I'll make sure he doesn't see the sun tomorrow.

536
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,040
Is the result out?

537
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,680
What happened?

538
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,480
How did Lieutenant Ikegami die?

539
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,200
Captain!

540
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,680
How is it?

541
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:05,360
According to preliminary findings,

542
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,480
Lieutenant Ikegami died

543
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,600
was around 45 p.m. yesterday.

544
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,880
He drank before he died.

545
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:12,880
We found alcohol

546
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,600
in his stomach fluid.

547
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,840
We didn't find anything

548
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,800
any signs of inhaling smoke.

549
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,560
So, Lieutenant Ikegami

550
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,960
was probably dead

551
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,640
before the motorcycle burned.

552
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,500
So someone killed Irigami first?

553
00:35:25,080 --> 00:35:26,120
Not yet.

554
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,000
What's the real cause of death?

555
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,460
He died of asphyxiation due to a broken neck.

556
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,540
His neck is broken.

557
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,800
His neck is broken.

558
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,900
You mean your neck was broken?

559
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,480
After the motorcycle fell off the cliff,

560
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,480
If Captain Irigami lands first,

561
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,800
the neck may be broken.

562
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:42,920
and suffocated.

563
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,880
Maybe the motorcycle

564
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,040
after that.

565
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,760
But at least before the motorcycle caught fire,

566
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,420
the leader couldn't breathe.

567
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,720
So this is a murder?

568
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,360
You can't say that.

569
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,560
He found a gunshot wound.

570
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:57,490
or a knife wound?

571
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,880
No.

572
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,120
But Dr. Jin said

573
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:02,000
he came to the hospital

574
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,160
and saw a bite wound.

575
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,280
On the arm.

576
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,240
Bite.

577
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:08,960
Who bit it?

578
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:10,960
I don't know.

579
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:15,480
Notify everyone.

580
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,040
I request the military hospital

581
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,240

What time is it on the well?

587
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:30,520
I came to the military hospital.

588
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,800
When did you leave?

589
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,130

590
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,120
What did you do?

591
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,400
What did you say?

592
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,400
Don't miss a single drop.

Catch me!

598
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,330
Why aren't Bi Ying and Takegi here yet?

599
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,000
If they

600
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,800
in the hospital,

601
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,520
it means you admit

602
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,240
has something to do with this.

603
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,320
Do you understand?

604
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,880
Aren't you worried at all?

605
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,860
What's the point of worrying?

606
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,520
If they find us here,

607
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:38,800
we might die.

608
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,640
Aren't you scared at all?

609
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,000
There's nothing we can do about it.

610
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,040
Nurse Tang.

611
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:49,160
You need to take a deep breath.

612
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,800
Calm down.

613
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:54,640
Think about the people we love.

614
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,840
For our faith,

615
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,840
Don't be afraid.

616
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,240
You are a brave girl.

617
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,400
God will protect us.

618
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:10,400
Everything will be fine.

619
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,520
Take some men

620
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,000
to shoot that old fortune-teller.

621
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:41,760
Do it now?

622
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,640
Immediately.

623
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,930
Captain, you want to see me?

624
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,280
How should we inform his father

625
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,610
How should we inform his father, Inasaki?

626
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,560
Inabasi.

627
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,480
He died so miserably.

628
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,720
The body can't be identified.

629
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,480
To be honest,

630
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,080
is not a good idea.

631
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,920
I always feel

632
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,360
something is wrong.

633
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,040
What's going on?

634
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,800
I really

635
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,480
I'm not convinced.

640
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:07,060

Second,

642
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,000
Find out all the activities on the day of the accident.

643
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,240
I want to see if they have

644
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,560
are intertwined.

645
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,320

646
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:21,400

647
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,960

648
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,820
everything will be clear.

649
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,360
I'll organize the forces

650
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,060

651
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,160
