1
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,520
What's going on?

2
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,080
Captain Oshima!

3
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:43,759
Looks like

4
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,000
on purpose.

5
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:46,600
I even invited

6
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,320
from the police station.

7
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,000
Tokyo Police Station.

8
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,479
What's going on?

9
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,320
Commander.

10
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,200
Mr. Suzuki of the Ministry of Taxation

11
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,280
has never made any decision

12
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,640
the immigration of Okinawa Island.

13
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,560
I also made up Mr. Suzuki.

14
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,280
Yabel.

15
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,960
The general manager of the Tuo Minister is not Suzuki.

16
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,640
It's Green Dragon.

17
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,000
Sorry.

18
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,520
Captain Oshima Hao.

19
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,720
It's a misunderstanding.

20
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:32,760
Oshima Hao.

21
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,280
Tell me

22
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,800
to me.

23
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:42,400
I have nothing to say.

24
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,360
Yabel.

25
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,520
What did you say?

26
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,880
I'm from Tokyo Police Agency.

27
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,560
The sixth investigator.

28
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,280
Oshima-ho.

29
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,680
You'd better give me a reasonable explanation.

30
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,160
Yes.

31
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,079
The investigator from Tokyo Police Agency

32
00:03:26,079 --> 00:03:27,760
to investigate Colonel.

33
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,079
I found something wrong

34
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:29,960
with Colonel Mugi's secret letter.

35
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,720
What is it?

36
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,600
I checked this secret letter.

37
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,560
There is no record in the palace.

38
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,960
A superiors officer who overstepped the boundary.

39
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,000
You even investigated the officer of the Military Police Office.

40
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,880
How dare you!

41
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,400
Answer me a question first.

42
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,600
Where did you get this letter?

43
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:16,920
Colonel.

44
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,320
What are you nervous about?

45
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,680
Can you send a telegram here?

46
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,200
To whom?

47
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:29,720
The military office.

48
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,640
Sakamoto.

49
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,480
Go get my phone.

50
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,520
Colonel.

51
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:28,560
Go ahead.

52
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,400
Just send a telegram

53
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,480
you can clear

54
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,720
my suspicion of you.

55
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,800
There's no need to hesitate.

56
00:05:41,159 --> 00:05:42,040
Just send it.

57
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,480
I know. I'll send it.

58
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,160
Hello.

59
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,120
Answer the telegram.

60
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,840
Colonel Takemuki needs to send a telegram

61
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,720
to Tokyo Police Office.

62
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,720
Which class are you in, Colonel?

63
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:19,520
First class.

64
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,240
Colonel is the first class.

65
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,760
First class.

66
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:31,840
Okay.

67
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,120
Hold on.

68
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:45,320
Colonel.

69
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,400
Please answer.

70
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,480
I'm Ichiro Takemichi.

71
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:30,200
Send a telegram

72
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,960
A telegram from General Ryan Tanuma.

73
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,320
This is the telegram.

74
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:37,640
Hello, Shogun. I'm Ichiro Takemichi.

75
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,760
I'm still doing well in Sambu Island.

76
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,120
but it's not over yet.

77
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,159
Please don't worry.

78
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:45,640
Also,

79
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,159
the highest commander of Airlines 6,

80
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:48,200
This investigation is questioned.

81
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,560
is not reported or recorded in the palace.

82
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,800
Please verify it.

83
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,159
Chief Commander of Airlines 6.

84
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:53,520
General Fujita.

85
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,120
Over.

86
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,520
Okay, please wait a moment.

87
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,080
Are you saying

88
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,720
the case in the corner?

89
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:54,680
Yes.

90
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,800
Did His Majesty ask again?

91
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,640
I thought you forgot.

92
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,600
Yes.

93
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,560
Then go there.

94
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,360
But don't be too serious.

95
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:20,520
Yes.

96
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,840
It involves the conflicts between the Army and the Navy.

97
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,040
Don't make it worse.

98
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:39,960
Report to me

99
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,760
report to me at any time.

100
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,080
Army Headquarters

101
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,760
I’ll cooperate with your investigation.

102
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,880
Be careful.

103
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,880
Two telegrams from the military office.

104
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,720
One for Colonel Takemichi.

105
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,800
One for Commander Fujita.

106
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,920
Captain Tokyo.

107
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,400
A telegram from General Renmara.

108
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,360
Please take care, Colonel.

109
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,840
Return to Tokyo as soon as the investigation is done.

110
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,840
Good luck with the investigation.

111
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,280
Please wait.

112
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:04,240
Go ahead.

113
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,720
General Renmara says hello to Commander Fujita.

114
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,720
The Emperor suggested

115
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,200
was proposed by His Majesty

116
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,840
to report to me.

117
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,480
Commander Fujita,

118
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,280
to cooperate with the Colonel's investigation.

119
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:19,800
Attendant Officer Jang-Ryun.

120
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:31,040
Please return

121
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,000
Yes, sir!

122
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,240
I'll do my best to cooperate with you.

123
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:39,880
Don't worry.

124
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:43,880
Thank you.

125
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,840
Oshima.

126
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,240
From now on,

127
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,080
the captain of the special forces.

128
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,480
Sakamoto, get him out of here.

129
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,720
Commander.

130
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,640
Get out!

131
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,640
Oshima-kun!

132
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,400
Sakamoto, kick him out!

133
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,720
Colonel.

134
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,240
Although I was rude today,

135
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:31,880
but I hope you don't mind.

136
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,840
Let's have a drink.

137
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,640
I'll drink first.

138
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,000
Yabi.

139
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:51,960
Yes.

140
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,960
I will leave on the earliest boat.

141
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,520
Please forgive me.

142
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,880
Let's go.

143
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:04,560
Here you go.

144
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,560
I can't believe he stole it.

145
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,320
Yabi went back.

146
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,800
He asked me to tell you

147
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,880
I'm sorry I couldn't help.

148
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,200
And the woman you mentioned last time,

149
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,720
that woman will arrive tomorrow.

150
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,760
A secret telegram from the Ishang Apartment.

151
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:40,440
The American air force tattoo was found on the witness.

152
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,040
It must be the American we find.

153
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,880
The scattered points

154
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,520
are all connected.

155
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,720
What do you mean?

156
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:54,600
The man he took away

157
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,440
is the American we've been looking for.

158
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,600
His identity doesn't matter anymore.

159
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,400
What matters is

160
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,000
what kind of big secret

161
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,560
behind him and that American.

162
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,560
Fill it up.

163
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,160
All right.

164
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,560
Drink it.

165
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,920
You drink first.

166
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,800
Sir.

167
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,760
Come in.

168
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:01,760
Chief.

169
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,760
How is it?

170
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:04,840
Any news?

171
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:06,600
I just got some accurate information.

172
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,240
The carpenter has rescued

173
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,160
out of the island.

174
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,840
But during the handover,

175
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,080
during the handover.

176
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,240
In order to protect the information,

177
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,400
to protect their information.

178
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,800
Where's the carpenter?

179
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,880
He's not exposed.

180
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,360
He has returned to the island.

181
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:20,960
Now Ye Bi-ying

182
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:23,000
who knows the signal and password.

183
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,040
The woodcutter will find a way

184
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,240
to bring her out of the island.

185
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:33,160
Six days left until April 18.

186
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,080
Time is running out.

187
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,000
Hey!

188
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,200
Keep watching.

189
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,680
Report to me if you have any news.

190
00:15:58,640 --> 00:15:59,480
Captain.

191
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,400
What should we do next?

192
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,400
I was dismissed.

193
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Now you are the captain.

194
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,120
Please give your instructions.

195
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:21,680
If the second-class soldier who died in Shanghai

196
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,360
is Americans,

197
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,680
But he has to go back to the island.

198
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,840
It means there's something he didn't bring out.

199
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,840
As time goes by,

200
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,040
our colonel

201
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,000
will soon be hard to comprehend.

202
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,960
When there are more and more bugs,

203
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:39,080
we have to wait

204
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,320
waiting for him to give himself away.

205
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,800
so much that he can't even make up for himself.

206
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,880
By then,

207
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:54,560
it's our turn.

208
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,680
I'm going to look for Fujita.

209
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,119
and arrange the rest.

210
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,880
Wait for me in the room.

211
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,760
Recently, many accidents happened on the island.

212
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,600
which affected the progress of Colonel’s work.

213
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:42,600
I’m responsible for it.

214
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,760
I think these things

215
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,800
is beyond our expectation.

216
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,120
Don't blame yourself, Commander.

217
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,960
The witness you brought out

218
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,480
died for no reason.

219
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:04,480
The officer behind is still on the island. Can you tell me who he is?

220
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:05,880
His superior

221
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,960
knows about this.

222
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,240
I can't imagine

223
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,080
what will happen between us.

224
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,720
Colonel.

225
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,800
Do you have a plan?

226
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,920
They thought if we kill the witness,

227
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:22,720
after killing that witness.

228
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,480
That's only temporary.

229
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:25,680
I will

230
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,920
to find new evidence

231
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,640
to find new evidence.

232
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:32,520
So

233
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,200
you have a direction?

234
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:35,880
Of course.

235
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,800
I’ll report to you

236
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,800
I'll report it to you.

237
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,520
I hope there won't be any more trouble.

238
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,040
Goodbye.

239
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:07,800
The second group of members

240
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,040
are on the island today.

241
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,920
The lives of the villagers

242
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,600
will only be harder.

243
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,560
From now on,

244
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,800
try not to leave my sight.

245
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,960
Turn around.

246
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,480
Done.

247
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,520
Colonel's manuscript is here.

248
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:17,840
Thank you.

249
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,840
Mr. Sakamoto has entered

250
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:22,120
of the investigation.

251
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,000
I have to report to Tokyo

252
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,680
to Tokyo at any time.

253
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,640
It's my honor

254
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,400
It's an honor.

255
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:32,920
Please.

256
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:40,080
The pigeon channel between Macao and Sambu Island

257
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,920
has been exposed.

258
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:46,480
Please report to the organization.

259
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,520
Sir.

260
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,200
Come in.

261
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:26,840
Commander!

262
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,080
The Navy Headquarters is calling.

263
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,320
Let's go.

264
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,920
Airlines 14.

265
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,320
The main forces are evacuated.

266
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,720
All of them!

267
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,920
The 7th aircraft base of Haikou

268
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,240
and the 11th Airport base

269
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,560
from Guangxi Island.

270
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,520
Send my order.

271
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,160
Confiscate all units radio stations.

272
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,000
will be reported by the command centre.

273
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,680
and strictly prevent news of retreat from leaking.

274
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,520
It's your turn.

275
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,040
One careless move

276
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,840
I lost the whole game.

277
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,760
Thank you, captain.

278
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,000
What are you doing?

279
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,680
There's a new drug.

280
00:23:17,680 --> 00:23:18,720
Let him try.

281
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,600
Let go.

282
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:21,880
Stop it.

283
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:22,880
Yes.

284
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,920
Help me out!

285
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,600
I'll blow you up!

286
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,520
I'll blow you up!

287
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,680
I...

288
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,240
It's okay.

289
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,080
It's okay.

290
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,800
Get out.

291
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,720
Get out.

292
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,840
It's okay.

293
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,240
It's okay.

294
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,160
Have a seat.

295
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,960
What did you just say?

296
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,600
Do you like it?

297
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,040
Isn't it good?

298
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:08,880
And

299
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,000
Where to fry?

300
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,120
Isn't it good?

301
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,560
Where?

302
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,960
Tokyo!

303
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,960
Tonight, General Steven

304
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,200
will send a transporter

305
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,120
will arrive at San Zhou Airport in China

306
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,880
to help Du Lite land.

307
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,680
Do they know about this operation?

308
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:57,680
No.

309
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,240
This operation is a secret.

310
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,720
We only know

311
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,560
they went there

312
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,840
to replenish fuel for the plane.

313
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:03,800
Good.

314
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,280
Where are we now?

315
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,760
1,600 miles east of Japan.

316
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,520
is recorded in the diary.

317
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,360
April 16th.

318
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:15,480
Our fleet

319
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,480
is 1,600 miles east of Japan.

320
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,760
After fighting,

321
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,280
Our fleet continues

322
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,520
at the speed of 25 joints.

323
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,400
Order reconnaissance.

324
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,160
Search 300 miles ahead of us.

325
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,160
I don't want to see

326
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,360
the Japanese patrol boat suddenly appear.

327
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,560
Make sure

328
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:34,760
in every area.

329
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,200
Yes, sir.

330
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,280
Prepare the reconnaissance.

331
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,080
Roger.

332
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,640
The reconnaissance machine left the ship.

333
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,160
Roger.

334
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,840
We're getting closer to Japan.

335
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:06,040
Sir.

336
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,760
What if we get arrested?

337
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:18,560
You're still young.

338
00:28:20,520 --> 00:28:21,920
Your lives are too precious.

339
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:23,640
Don't think about being arrested.

340
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,560
I'm old.

341
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,160
I don't want to stay in Japan for a day.

342
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,720
I believe our Chinese friends

343
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,480
will bring us home.

344
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,520
Guys.

345
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,680
Pull it up.

346
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,040
Pull it up.

347
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,560
Work together.

348
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,880
To fight,

349
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,640
To fight.

350
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:24,880
Plane.

351
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,200
The plane is here.

352
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,120
Run! The plane is here!

353
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:32,040
Run!

354
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,040
Lie down.

355
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:34,280
Lie down.

356
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,680
Get down!

357
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,080
Our plane

358
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,280
Put out the fire!

359
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,720
Put out the fire!

360
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,720
Hurry!

361
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:47,240
Bring water.

362
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,560
Put out the fire!

363
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:54,920
Yes.

364
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:55,840
Got it.

365
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,040
Who knows?

366
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,920
This is Douglas C-46.

367
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,840
What are you doing here?

368
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:08,640
Sir.

369
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,240
I heard that this plane

370
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,680
was transferred here

371
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,360
I was transferred here.

372
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,280
We don't know

373
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,800
I'm not sure yet.

374
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,320
Who knows

375
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,520
of this plane?

376
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,240
Is General Steven's aerial advisor

377
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,080
is also on this plane?

378
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:34,920
What are you doing?

379
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,040
You don't know anything.

380
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,000
You can leave now.

381
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,000
Yes.

382
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,360
Sir.

383
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,720
Is this plane

384
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,680
is related to

385
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,480
in a few days?

386
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,840
The secret mission

387
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,920
was landed at the airport

388
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,600
at the early morning of the 20th.

389
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,560
It has nothing to do with this C-46.

390
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,560
Sir.

391
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,520
Do we need to report this?

392
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,520
Let's check the loss first

393
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,080
and report the situation.

394
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:19,600
Yes.

395
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,960
The reservators at the airport

396
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:22,880
didn't know

397
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:26,200
This Douglas C-46 Transportation Airport

398
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,080
was destroyed at the San ju Airport.

399
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,160
and fell at the same time.

400
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,760
There's another one

401
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,680
1,600 to 2,000 Hz frequency.

402
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:37,200
radio signals

403
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,000
and night airport lighting support equipment.

404
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,120
The original plan

405
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,600
is used to guide the squadron

406
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,520
the plane landing.

407
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,360
After the crash,

408
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,560
because no one was ordered

409
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,520
no one cares about these devices.

410
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,520
What are they for?

411
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,520
It's destined that

412
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,280
will never receive

413
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,720
from

414
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,160
sent by Laozhou Airport

415
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,000
burned the ground tracking radio.

416
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,280
The sky can never confirm

417
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,440
the exact location of the Huizhou Airport.

418
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,160
Squadron Du Lite.

419
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,080
The only hope to land safely

420
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,560
is the password Ye Bi-ying remembers.

421
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,160
frequency and number.

422
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,480
By the airport,

423
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,480
and call the pilot directly

424
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,440
to guide the plane to land safely.

425
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,200
You're a Japanese, right?

426
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,640
No.

427
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,240
Let me show you something.

428
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,160
You've seen it before.

429
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,240
That's right.

430
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,520
My mother and I

431
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:12,600
with my mother.

432
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,000
Takahashi and Yumiko's wedding.

433
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,240
The people you love the most

434
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,760
is here.

435
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:32,600
I love Takahashi.

436
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:33,360
and Yumi.

437
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,520
I don't have many friends since I was young.

438
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:39,480
My feelings

439
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,760
is locked at that time.

440
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,600
Be careful, Yumiko.

441
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:04,120
Your book is upside down.

442
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,000
What's your name?

443
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,760
Can't you speak?

444
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:20,000
I'm Yumiko.

445
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,320
I'm Yumiko.

446
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:28,320
Yumiko.

447
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,199
Yumiko.

448
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,199
Oh, right.

449
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:34,280
So you can talk.

450
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,280
I'm Shin Woong Takahashi.

451
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:38,400
What's your name?

452
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,560
But now there's another one.

453
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:53,159
What are you looking at?

454
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:54,199
I'm talking about you.

455
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:07,560
There is a legend in Japan

456
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,040
there was a monkey in Pinchuan.

457
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,200
He would steal other people's secrets.

458
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,280
Those who steal secrets

459
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,960
will forget this secret one day.

460
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,720
But that monkey will remember it forever.

461
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,480
Will it return the secret?

462
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,160
That monkey stole

463
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,360
too many people's secrets.

464
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,800
I gradually forget which one is mine.

465
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,240
Sometimes,

466
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,120
I really envy those

467
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,480
those who were stolen by it.

468
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,520
can forget.

469
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,360
But I can't.

470
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,520
Shin Woong of Takahashi.

471
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,640
I killed him myself.

472
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,120
What are you doing?

473
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,000
Colonel,

474
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:39,920
We are arresting traitors.

475
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:42,640
Who is it?

476
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,840
Shin-woong from Takahashi.

477
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:49,960
Wait here.

478
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,320
Without my order,

479
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:52,840
or hear the gunshot,

480
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:53,800
no one is allowed to come in.

481
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,400
I told the people outside.

482
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,360
Without my order,

483
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:21,920
or hear the gunshot,

484
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,600
no one is allowed to come in.

485
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,360
My gun is not as fast as yours.

486
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,560
Your assumption is not true.

487
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,640
The higher-ups have suspected it.

488
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,600
They said there were

489
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,200
and the Military Police.

490
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:50,520
in the Military Police.

491
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,640
Are you?

492
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,320
Tell me.

493
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,920
What do you need me to do?

494
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:14,200
I know too well about the interrogation methods of Special Class.

495
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,480
I can't handle it.

496
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,000
You have to help me.

497
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,200
From the day

498
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,680
to choose this path,

499
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:25,160
we are ready

500
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,840
to face this moment.

501
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,280
We will sacrifice.

502
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,400
But we won't betray our faith.

503
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,120
I didn't expect that.

504
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,800
Not at all.

505
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,000
If I knew this would happen,

506
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,040
I wouldn't have let you come.

507
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:13,920
If you call me,

508
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,800
I'll come anytime.

509
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,120
If you shoot me later,

510
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,760
but don't hit my arm.

511
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,800
Just come here.

512
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,840
When I wrote the report,

513
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,240
you shot me

514
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,280
for self-defense.

515
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,360
who betrayed his country.

516
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,080
Shin-woong from Takahashi.

517
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,160
All right.

518
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,280
I have nothing more to ask.

519
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:12,880
For you,

520
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,960
and those who have sacrificed.

521
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:18,840
We must fight!

522
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,680
Shinxiong Takahashi.

523
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:48,120
A crime of treason.

524
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,040
Refuse arrest.

525
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,320
Shoot him.

526
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,800
I walked alone for too long.

527
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,240
I never had a partner.

528
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,200
I'm lucky to meet you.

529
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:16,280
You know?

530
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,880
In a lifetime,

531
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:20,720
in a lifetime.

532
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:23,880
or even get married a few times.

533
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,760
But it's really hard

534
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,560
to find a real partner.

535
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:35,840
Friends.

536
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,880
We're already friends.

537
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:41,320
Right?

538
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,640
I'll take you with me.

539
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,080
I'll take you

540
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,320
to the end of this journey.

541
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:56,800
Don't hold me back.

542
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,080
Who's holding me back?

543
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:03,920
Bye.

544
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,080
