1
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,120
Officer, wait!

2
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:58,600
Please show me your ID.

3
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,610
Here's my identification.

4
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,800
These are the tank modification plans

5
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,330
that Engineer Kaiekawa and I are discussing.

6
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:11,000
These are the design blueprints for tanks

7
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,330
we're using on the Southeast Asian front.

8
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,920
This is the fountain pen

9
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,980
I just used to approve the revisions.

10
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,720
Colonel, please forgive me.

11
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,160
I couldn't stop them.

12
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,880
I hope you can

13
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,440
finish looking at it quickly and return it to me.

14
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,240
But first,

15
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,340
you need to have the authority to examine it.

16
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,760
Colonel, sir.

17
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,800
I'm terribly sorry, sir.

18
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,760
I'm Ida Joji from Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department.

19
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,840
I'm mainly here to oversee

20
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,280
the recruitment for the 101st Division.

21
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,040
I wonder who gave you the nerve

22
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,520
to barge into this room.

23
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,440
Are you suspicious of Engineer Kaiekawa

24
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,480
or do you doubt my identity?

25
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,760
Should I visit the police headquarters tomorrow

26
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,160
to report my work in detail

27
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,360
to your superiors?

28
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,040
Or should I demand

29
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,840
a reasonable explanation from him?

30
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,720
Why are his subordinates

31
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:54,920
disrupting my work?

32
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:56,840
Colonel, sir,

33
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,170
I sincerely apologize.

34
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,210
We truly didn't know you were here.

35
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,760
It was absolutely unintentional.

36
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,160
Unintentional, you say?

37
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,400
When facing these blueprints,

38
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,080
should you examine them carefully

39
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,000
or should you shut your damn eyes?

40
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,000
Shut them.

41
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,560
Look!

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:19,680
Open your eyes and look.

43
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,210
Isn't that what you wanted?

44
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:22,840
Look.

45
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:24,520
Look at it!

46
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,640
Colonel, please calm down.

47
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,520
They were just doing their duty.

48
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,920
Please, Colonel,

49
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,600
try

50
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,040
not to blame them.

51
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,200
Yes, yes.

52
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,360
For Engineer Kaiekawa's sake...

53
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,120
Were you ever here today?

54
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,560
No.

55
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,720
Is there any issue with Engineer Kaiekawa?

56
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,400
No.

57
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,040
I need to continue discussing

58
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,760
the design blueprints with Engineer Kaiekawa.

59
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,920
And I don't want any disturbances.

60
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,050
Can you manage that?

61
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,680
Yes, yes.

62
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,320
Then get out now!

63
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,400
Yes, I'll take my leave.

64
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:38,040
This Colonel is too fierce.

65
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,159
Did you see his face?

66
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,840
I didn't dare to look.

67
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,770
Let's hurry out of here.

68
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,360
Go.

69
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,880
Close the door.

70
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,090
Alright.

71
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,000
Lumberjack calling.

72
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,920
Verification.

73
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,360
995-3421.

74
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,000
Repeat.

75
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,520
Lumberjack calling.

76
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,200
Verification 995-3421.

77
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,680
Report,

78
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:45,920
Director,

79
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,360
Lumberjack calling.

80
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,320
At this moment,

81
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,780
the CPC Shanghai underground organization

82
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,440
also received the signal that Wumu had been awakened.

83
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:13,040
He is one of the Japanese Emperor's cabinet members,

84
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,080
serving as a Military Council Officer,

85
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,720
which means he's a Japanese baron

86
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,840
and a Navy Admiral.

87
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,120
Dajiao Censheng.

88
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,340
On the morning of February 5th last year.

89
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:24,920
An aircraft

90
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,440
crashed in Doumen District north of Sanzao Island

91
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,100
on Mount Huangyang at an altitude of 580 meters.

92
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,880
Last July, our undercover agents

93
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,760
received orders to investigate the crash.

94
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,640
But shortly after that.

95
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,760
Prime Minister Konoe Fumimaro stepped down

96
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,520
and Tojo Hideki took over as Prime Minister.

97
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,120
The investigation was put on hold.

98
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,280
Now we plan.

99
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,920
We'll restart this mission

100
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,040
with our undercover agent

101
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,960
posing as an envoy from the Japanese royal family

102
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,920
under the pretext of investigating General Kakumine's

103
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,040
plane crash

104
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,370
to land on Sanzao Island

105
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,520
and rescue our man.

106
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,680
I'm thinking

107
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,440
perhaps we should provide our agent

108
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,440
with an assistant who knows the area well

109
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:04,120
to accompany him to the island.

110
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,040
You mean

111
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,360
a high-ranking Japanese officer

112
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:10,600
with a Chinese assistant?

113
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,360
Yes.

114
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,440
The Japanese carried out a massacre on the island

115
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,800
so if we send someone

116
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,680
wearing a Japanese uniform

117
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,480
the locals will never trust him.

118
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,800
We can arrange it

119
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,320
and explain it as

120
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,360
the Tokyo envoy requesting

121
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,040
Shanghai Station 76 to help

122
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:31,640
find a native of Sanzao Island

123
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:34,159
to accompany him as an assistant.

124
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,800
This way, I think

125
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,330
it should be a plausible explanation.

126
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,880
If the person we find

127
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,440
isn't a professional agent

128
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,680
do you think that would work?

129
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,840
No problem.

130
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,480
The assistant would be visiting relatives and friends on the island

131
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,680
making daily visits

132
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,960
but his real purpose

133
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,880
is to locate our

134
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,760
Allied major who parachuted there

135
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,600
and convince the locals to hand him over

136
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,800
to support our cause.

137
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:57,880
Okay.

138
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,720
Director Li,

139
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,520
please inform everyone

140
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:04,440
to proceed according to Director Shen's instructions.

141
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,360
We may not have enough time.

142
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,440
Notify our internal system directly

143
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,320
and all combat zones

144
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,880
to search the personnel records overnight.

145
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,120
We need to find

146
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,440
a qualified person from Sanzao Island.

147
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:14,920
Yes.

148
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,720
Wait.

149
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,260
Someone's coming.

150
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:39,840
Let's hide.

151
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,720
Go.

152
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,200
Why are they out so late?

153
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:11,640
Xia'er,

154
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,130
follow them and see.

155
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:13,720
Okay.

156
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,080
What about the major?

157
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
We're not far from home.

158
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,280
Don't worry, I'll handle it.

159
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,400
You go check it out.

160
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:19,960
Alright.

161
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,040
Auntie Si, give me a hand.

162
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:22,770
That's good.

163
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:23,580
Coming.

164
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,680
Take it slow, Dad.

165
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,040
Okay.

166
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,290
Take the small path.

167
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,700
Search carefully.

168
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,360
Sir.

169
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,280
His body is very hot.

170
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,280
I think he has a fever.

171
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,320
Go to Long Xia's room

172
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,380
and get some clothes and his blanket.

173
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,040
Also prepare some alcohol

174
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,370
to bring down his fever.

175
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:06,880
Yes.

176
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,760
I'll help him in.

177
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:09,810
Take it slow.

178
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,800
You go.

179
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,640
Okay.

180
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,560
Come.

181
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:17,970
The secret room is here.

182
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,820
Stand up properly.

183
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:36,290
Come.

184
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,640
This secret chamber

185
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:58,360
was built by my grandfather years ago.

186
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,920
That was many years ago.

187
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,220
It was specifically built to protect against pirates.

188
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,200
Come quickly.

189
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:13,840
Come here.

190
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,040
I found an American military cap.

191
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:17,360
Look at this.

192
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:25,760
Now you can tell me

193
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:27,440
why you came to China.

194
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,640
This matter is too significant.

195
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,960
I'm sorry, I can't tell you.

196
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:38,280
Fine, I won't ask anymore.

197
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,720
What is it?

198
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,400
The Japanese might already know

199
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,560
about the Major.

200
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,720
They found

201
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,120
his lost cap on the beach.

202
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,360
I think soon

203
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,280
the Japanese soldiers will conduct a major search.

204
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,340
Should we move him?

205
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,880
I'm back.

206
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,850
I might need to go on a trip in a few days.

207
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,120
When will you leave?

208
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:05,960
Soon, I guess.

209
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:11,120
They issued another conscription order today.

210
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,560
All men under 55 must enlist.

211
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,960
Every child

212
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,400
is flesh and blood of their mother.

213
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,400
No mother

214
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,320
wants to see her child

215
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,320
shot by bullets.

216
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,920
How heartbreaking that must be.

217
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,600
I can take care of myself.

218
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,600
Earlier today,

219
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,880
Toshiki Mayama's mother

220
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,680
brought many senninbari

221
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:41,300
asking us to finish them quickly.

222
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,760
She said they're for soldiers at the front

223
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,160
to protect them from bullets.

224
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:45,960
But

225
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,000
right after you left,

226
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,800
she received her younger son's

227
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,440
death notice.

228
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:01,240
You really shouldn't be making these.

229
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,800
These senninbari might

230
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,560
be sent to the battlefield in China.

231
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,490
Where are you going?

232
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,440
China.

233
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,880
7702 preparing for test flight.

234
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,560
7702, roger that.

235
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,120
7702 ready.

236
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,400
7702 ignition.

237
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,960
Roger.

238
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,960
7702 taxiing to runway.

239
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,840
7702 cleared for takeoff.

240
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:52,520
7702, good luck with your 250-meter takeoff.

241
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,320
Why do we need to practice

242
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,440
a 250-meter takeoff distance?

243
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:27,680
Our aircraft

244
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,740
simply can't meet this requirement.

245
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,320
This thing is too heavy.

246
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,800
Even the best pilot couldn't

247
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,840
take off on such a short runway.

248
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,560
Major,

249
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,120
a 13-ton beast like this

250
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,320
on such a short runway

251
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,040
definitely won't get airborne.

252
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,500
Go get the chief engineer.

253
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,840
Tell the planes to return.

254
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,000
We need to remove all the heavy equipment.

255
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,520
Sir, remove all the guns?

256
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,080
What the hell is he trying to do?

257
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,280
I have no idea either.

258
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,240
7702, return to base.

259
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,520
7702, copy that.

260
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:23,600
The worst shooting weapon in the world

261
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,200
is the belly turret.

262
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:25,720
Sir.

263
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,480
Does the gunner have to control it

264
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,920
remotely through a periscope?

265
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,400
Before learning how to aim,

266
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,240
you might as well learn to play the violin.

267
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,400
Take it off.

268
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:34,840
Yes, sir.

269
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,280
It will save us

270
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,880
a lot of weight and extra gunners.

271
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,840
All we really need is the tail gun.

272
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,960
I think the tail gun is useless too.

273
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,420
We can remove that as well.

274
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,440
Colonel.

275
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,720
If we remove the belly guns and tail guns,

276
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,180
what do we do if we encounter enemy aircraft?

277
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,560
Use this.

278
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,920
Paint it black.

279
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,520
No one can tell the difference from a distance.

280
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,960
A broomstick?

281
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,920
We found that

282
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,200
the bodies of the pilot and navigator

283
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,320
were both wearing flight caps.

284
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,680
So this military cap

285
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:36,520
must belong to a fourth person.

286
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:40,360
There were four people on this plane.

287
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:45,320
At least four people.

288
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,960
A transport aircraft

289
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,200
carrying American soldiers passing through Sanzao Island,

290
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,440
what were they up to?

291
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,200
That's what I can't figure out either.

292
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,720
Sasaki.

293
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,400
Do you think this person is dead or alive?

294
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,640
How could this hat be found

295
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,920
on the east coast of Tan Bay?

296
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,840
It's possible that when the plane was shot down,

297
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,880
he was killed,

298
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,020
his body fell into the sea,

299
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,520
and the hat was washed ashore.

300
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,080
That's one possibility.

301
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,360
But there's another possibility.

302
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,360
What is it?

303
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,960
This person isn't dead,

304
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,920
and he made it to the island.

305
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,840
Really?

306
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:55,880
Mr. Doi.

307
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,400
Post sentries

308
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,080
around the entire village

309
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,440
to prevent anyone from escaping.

310
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,920
Yes, sir.

311
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,600
[About face].

312
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,760
Everyone else search the village.

313
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,960
Check every single house.

314
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,720
Move out!

315
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,040
[About face].

316
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,440
[Double time].

317
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,560
Let's go too.

318
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,640
Heibei, take a sniff.

319
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,200
Sniff it carefully.

320
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,240
Whose house is this?

321
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,920
It seems to belong to the wealthy Mr. Ye Degong's

322
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:13,760
servant.

323
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,680
She's an old woman

324
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,400
who usually lives at the Ye household

325
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,130
but sometimes comes back here.

326
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,240
Sasaki,

327
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,610
go to Mr. Ye Degong's house.

328
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,080
Well done.

329
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,480
Coming!

330
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,080
Master

331
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,240
is coming.

332
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,400
He's at our door.

333
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,800
And he has a dog with him.

334
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,040
Don't panic.

335
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,250
Go in to pay respects

336
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,760
and light the incense first.

337
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:57,760
Mr. Ye,

338
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,200
hello.

339
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,890
Why did you bring so many soldiers?

340
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,520
Well, it's like this.

341
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:06,640
We received reports from villagers

342
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,040
that your home

343
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,300
is hiding an American with a big nose.

344
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,800
You must be joking.

345
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,320
For years, this island

346
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,450
has been completely sealed off by you.

347
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:19,090
How could any American possibly get here?

348
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:21,920
So,

349
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,280
may we search?

350
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:24,120
Yes,

351
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,160
of course you may.

352
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:25,620
Please.

353
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,680
Heibei, sniff it.

354
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,040
Good job.

355
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,960
Let's go find it.

356
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,560
Where is it?

357
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,520
Where is it? Where is it?

358
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,040
Over there?

359
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,160
Or is it here?

360
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,560
Here?

361
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,040
This place.

362
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,320
Mr. Ye,

363
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,980
what are you doing?

364
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,240
Today is our ancestor's birthday.

365
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,170
There's a wine offering ceremony.

366
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,640
What's wrong?

367
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,480
Wait.

368
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,160
Come here.

369
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,560
What's going on with you?

370
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,020
Why are you falling apart at such a critical moment?

371
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,300
Report.

372
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,400
We've searched everywhere.

373
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,320
No findings.

374
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,840
Mr. Ye.

375
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,480
I heard you served as

376
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,040
a consul in America.

377
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:24,840
Is that right?

378
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,040
That was during the previous dynasty.

379
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,700
Now we're in the Republic era.

380
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,400
Yes.

381
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:31,920
But

382
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,240
you must be very familiar with

383
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,440
those big-nosed Americans.

384
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,760
Communicating with them

385
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,800
shouldn't be a problem for you,

386
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,360
right?

387
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,760
I never leave my front gate

388
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,400
or step beyond the second gate.

389
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,860
Where would I find any big-nosed Americans?

390
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,520
Don't forget what I told you in the ancestral hall.

391
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,680
Never touch

392
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,800
things you shouldn't touch.

393
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:58,810
Understand?

394
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,120
The country has its laws

395
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,720
and the family has its rules.

396
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,240
Next time when you enter,

397
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,560
please knock.

398
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:20,980
That's enough.

399
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,480
Fall in!

400
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,160
Fortunately they think

401
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,020
that American is just a big-nose.

402
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,240
You may escape today,

403
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,170
but tomorrow and the day after,

404
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,700
and the day after that.

405
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,760
If the Major's illness can't be cured,

406
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,290
how can we leave the island?

407
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,960
Help!

408
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,880
Help me!

409
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,120
Let me go!

410
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,320
Let go of me!

411
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,160
Help!

412
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,640
Huihui.

413
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,560
Let me go!

414
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,160
Help me!

415
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,640
Let go of me!

416
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,720
Father!

417
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:51,240
Dad.

418
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,080
Father.

419
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:00,960
The garrison soldiers

420
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:01,920
are here. Why?

421
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:06,240
Damn it, how am I supposed to write this report?

422
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,120
Attempting to rape a woman,

423
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,040
a second-class soldier

424
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,120
got beaten up by an old man.

425
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,180
How embarrassing.

426
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,800
There are plenty of women in the village.

427
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,560
Did you have to be so desperate?

428
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,420
This really pisses me off.

429
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,120
That's enough.

430
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,480
Take him back.

431
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:37,760
Sasaki,

432
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,320
take her to the comfort station.

433
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,160
Why are you doing this again?

434
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,840
I told Fukuda

435
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,160
to save this one for me.

436
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,600
Get up.

437
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,080
Come here.

438
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,920
Father.

439
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:55,680
Father.

440
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,480
Father.

441
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:10,360
Sorry,

442
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,280
I forgot about you.

443
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,240
Fall back.

444
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:41,640
Hello? Anyone here? Fukuda?

445
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,200
Captain Inoue.

446
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,040
Where is Fukuda?

447
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,520
Fukuda went to Shanghai to purchase goods.

448
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,290
He'll be back in a day or two.

449
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,560
I see.

450
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:51,880
In that case,

451
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:54,280
I'll leave this woman with you.

452
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,720
From today, she will serve the Imperial Army.

453
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,160
I'll save her especially for you.

454
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,840
Don't get up.

455
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,360
Mr. Ye.

456
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,840
Thank you very much for saving me.

457
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,920
I'll leave right away.

458
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:30,800
Where would you go

459
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,800
if you leave here?

460
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,320
I won't get you involved.

461
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,480
Where do you think you can go?

462
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,340
On this island,

463
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,680
there are no strangers.

464
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,160
You'll be out for less than a few hours

465
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,440
before you get caught.

466
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,770
I'll figure something out myself.

467
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,720
The Japanese won't catch me.

468
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,760
Before they find me,

469
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,080
I'll destroy everything,

470
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,340
including this Bible.

471
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:03,800
Major.

472
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,200
I believe the Japanese soldiers

473
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:08,240
won't find this place anytime soon.

474
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:09,960
It's safe here at least.

475
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,880
Just stay here and recover.

476
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,780
The only thing I can do now,

477
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,120
what I must do,

478
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,000
is find a way to keep you alive.

479
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,920
Try to find some penicillin.

480
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,480
If his fever continues like this,

481
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:33,480
it won't end well.

482
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:34,370
Alright.

483
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,880
That Tang Ju'er

484
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,840
works at the Japanese hospital.

485
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,000
Ask her for help.

486
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,170
Okay.

487
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,240
Don't worry, Dad.

488
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,600
I'll definitely get the medicine.

489
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,280
Be careful.

490
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:48,240
Director,

491
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,640
according to your instructions,

492
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,000
we are already in the system.

493
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,760
Other military regions have conducted searches too.

494
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:53,520
So far,

495
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,000
we haven't found anyone

496
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,000
who meets our requirements

497
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,720
from Sanzao Island within our system.

498
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,480
But in other military regions,

499
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,880
we found two candidates.

500
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,540
Tell me about them.

501
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,080
One is in Yichang,

502
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,080
in Hu Lian's 18th Army direct unit.

503
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,040
He's over 50 years old

504
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,400
and an illiterate stable hand.

505
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,560
The stable hand won't do.

506
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,090
Tell me about the other one.

507
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,120
The other candidate is quite suitable.

508
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:16,120
She's a woman.

509
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,480
Born in Honolulu.

510
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:19,420
She's from Sanzao Island.

511
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:22,400
Her father is the wealthiest man on the island.

512
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,440
She herself is a trainee military doctor.

513
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,170
She just arrived in Chongqing.

514
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:26,960
She's at

515
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,120
the 18th Group Army office in Zengjiayang.

516
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:32,650
Found in the list reported by the health unit.

517
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,620
She's from the Eighth Route Army.

518
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,280
Yes.

519
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,000
Her name is Ye Biying.

520
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,320
Ye Biying.

521
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,320
No way.

522
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,400
Absolutely not.

523
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,800
For such a confidential matter,

524
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,520
you actually brought me someone from the Eighth Route Army.

525
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,000
If the old man finds out,

526
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,120
he'll have my hide for sure.

527
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:55,000
Director,

528
00:31:55,520 --> 00:31:56,650
There's no one else.

529
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,920
You won't be able to find

530
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,920
anyone else.

531
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,160
This Sanzao Island

532
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,800
is already isolated.

533
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,280
The population is sparse.

534
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,760
Those willing to join the revolution

535
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,320
are extremely rare.

536
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,240
We're trying our best to search,

537
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,440
but there's little hope.

538
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,960
Director Li, you're here too.

539
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,400
You came at the right time.

540
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:17,560
Have you seen

541
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,690
this person's file?

542
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,360
I've seen it.

543
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,800
What do you think?

544
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,010
I think we can use it.

545
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,560
[Air raid! Get down!]

546
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,120
Ye Biying!

547
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:11,640
Hurry!

548
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,000
Ye Biying!

549
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:18,680
It's okay.

550
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:19,320
Ye Biying!

551
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,080
Comrade!

552
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,080
Have you seen Ye Biying from the 18th Army Group?

553
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:28,560
Who?

554
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,800
Ye Biying!

555
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,080
I can't hear clearly.

556
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,080
Ye Biying!

557
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,600
We got separated from her.

558
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,000
Go check over there.

559
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,680
Let's go.

560
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,440
Ye Biying!

561
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,200
Hurry up!

562
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,160
Comrade, are you Ye Biying?

563
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,080
Carry the child away!

564
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,520
Save the child quickly!

565
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:03,680
Go there!

566
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,480
There!

567
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,520
That way!

568
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:13,159
Hurry!

569
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,560
Bring him in!

570
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,159
Come on!

571
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:18,920
Put him here!

572
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,080
On the table!

573
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,840
Comrade, are you Ye Biying?

574
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,920
Hold him down!

575
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,080
Let me go!

576
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:33,800
Let me go!

577
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:35,320
Hang in there!

578
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:36,080
Stay strong!

579
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:37,480
Hold on, child!

580
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,520
Press on the wound!

581
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:38,980
Hold on!

582
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,409
Stay with us, child!

583
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,440
Let me go!

584
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,360
It'll be over soon, hang in there!

585
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,440
All right.

586
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:08,840
Press on it to stop the bleeding.

587
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,680
It's okay now.

588
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,370
Everything's fine.

589
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,560
Are you Ye Biying?

590
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,440
Our intelligence officers report

591
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,480
that Chiang Kai-shek and the Military Statistics Bureau

592
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,000
are sparing no expense

593
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,060
to rescue a stranded American major.

594
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,040
They've already activated the Lumberjack

595
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,700
and now they want to borrow someone else from us.

596
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,620
What's Yan'an's opinion?

597
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,920
Yan'an has approved this operation.

598
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:42,280
This location here.

599
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,440
Yes, Sanzao Island.

600
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,280
Report.

601
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,400
Come in.

602
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,560
Commander,

603
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,330
Comrade Ye Biying has arrived.

604
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,480
Comrade Ye.

605
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,860
Hello, Commander.

606
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,680
Are you from the

607
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,280
Health Unit? Ye Biying?

608
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,320
Reporting, sir.

609
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,040
Yes.

610
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:14,920
Come.

611
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,400
Thank you, sir.

612
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:16,930
Sit down.

613
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:22,740
You're from Sanzao Island in Zhongshan County?

614
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,560
How old are you?

615
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,320
I'm 26 this year.

616
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,920
In 1938,

617
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:29,520
I went from Guangzhou Women's College to Yan'an.

618
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,080
I studied medicine at the medical school under Dr. Norman Bethune's guidance.

619
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:32,880
Last year I was assigned to

620
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,920
the Health Unit at the Chongqing Office.

621
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,720
I'm still just a medical intern.

622
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:37,920
Okay.

623
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:40,170
Comrade Xiao Ye,

624
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:42,180
I'm quite familiar

625
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:44,040
with your recent situation.

626
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,280
I'll get straight to the point.

627
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,920
The Military Affairs Commission

628
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,360
and Bureau of Investigation and Statistics

629
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,600
want to borrow your services

630
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,060
to go back to your hometown

631
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,920
and carry out a special mission.

632
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,650
I'd like to hear your thoughts on this.

633
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,050
Military Intelligence agent.

634
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,360
Now during this united resistance war,

635
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,120
intelligence work between our two parties

636
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,650
can also be collaborative.

637
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,880
But my biggest concern

638
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,280
is that you have no experience in this field

639
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,880
and lack the necessary professional skills.

640
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,360
Working behind enemy lines,

641
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,560
one small mistake

642
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,720
could cost you your life.

643
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:18,720
Sir,

644
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,520
I'm not afraid of losing my life.

645
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:21,320
As long as

646
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,920
I'm not working for Military Intelligence agents.

647
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,160
Comrade Ye,

648
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,920
This isn't simply about

649
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,250
who you're working for.

650
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,080
Our war against Japan

651
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,080
has reached an extremely difficult stage.

652
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,200
This is our Chinese nation's

653
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,680
war for survival.

654
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:44,640
What you're doing

655
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,600
benefits our entire Chinese nation.

656
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,340
If that's the case.

657
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,440
Sir,

658
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,770
I'll follow the orders from above.

659
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,320
This is a

660
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,520
very dangerous mission.

661
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,040
I've thought it through.

662
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,980
When you return to Sanzao Island,

663
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:08,280
you'll be working as someone else's assistant.

664
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:08,940
This person

665
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,000
was trained at a Japanese spy school

666
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,200
and is a top graduate.

667
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,680
You must follow his leadership.

668
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,520
You mean to restart

669
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,320
the investigation of the Dajiao Censheng incident?

670
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,000
Yes.

671
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,640
Has His Majesty inquired about this matter again?

672
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:48,240
Yes.

673
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,860
I thought His Majesty had forgotten about this matter.

674
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,000
Indeed.

675
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,800
Then you should go ahead,

676
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,040
but don't take it too seriously.

677
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:09,920
Yes.

678
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:14,000
It will involve conflicts between the Army and Navy.

679
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,720
Don't escalate these conflicts.

680
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,610
Report the progress

681
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,240
of the investigation to me at any time.

682
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:26,600
Yes.

683
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,000
The Military Command

684
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,450
will cooperate with your investigation.

685
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,560
Be careful with everything.

686
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:46,840
Yes.

687
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:00,000
You need to memorize

688
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,600
this call sign by heart.

689
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:04,240
This is the call sign for one of our radio stations.

690
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,200
It's manned 24 hours a day.

691
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,680
When you need help,

692
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,760
you can send a message to this station.

693
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,280
We will do everything in our power

694
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,280
to provide the assistance you need.

695
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:19,160
00CE33335.

696
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,280
You've memorized it already?

697
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,860
I told you I have an excellent memory.

698
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:31,520
Good.

699
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Comrade Ye,

700
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:38,640
this is all I can give you,

701
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,520
the only trump card.

702
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,720
Understood, sir.

703
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:43,840
Good.

704
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,400
Comrade Ye,

705
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:46,880
you don't have

706
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,100
much time left.

707
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,000
In a few hours,

708
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:53,280
the Military Statistics Bureau will send a car to pick you up.

709
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:54,280
Let Counselor Qiu

710
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:56,760
give you some basic training.

711
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,200
This is the time and location

712
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,460
for your contact in Shanghai from Military Intelligence.

713
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,020
I've noted it down.

714
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,280
I'll contact you at the agreed time.

715
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:17,960
Also,

716
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:20,000
I need some one-time passwords.

717
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:20,730
Alright.

718
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:23,960
If the police department tracks

719
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,400
this radio station,

720
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,720
I'll repeatedly transmit at the last moment:

721
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:31,400
Wild goose.

722
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,440
Wild goose.

723
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,080
Wild goose.

724
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,220
What about the organization?

725
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:40,960
The Shanghai underground party

726
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,040
and Teacher will send someone to meet you.

727
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:43,880
If you reach Shanghai

728
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,600
and see Teacher,

729
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,930
please send my regards.

730
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:47,520
Tell him I miss him.

731
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,840
How long since you've been home?

732
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:55,740
Which home are you talking about?

733
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,480
China.

734
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,520
Wherever you are,

735
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,520
that's where I am.

736
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,240
This is already my home.

737
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,920
I used to think you were quite annoying.

738
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,210
These past few days,

739
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,320
I feel you're not so unlikeable.

740
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,520
When I come back,

741
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,220
we can argue again.

742
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:29,240
Goodbye,

743
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,280
you've got such a smart mouth.
