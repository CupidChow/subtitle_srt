1
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:37,340
There's a nurse at our military hospital

2
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,479
Tang Ju'er

3
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,600
who's about the same age as Ye Biying

4
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,800
and might know something about the situation.

5
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,680
Indeed.

6
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,640
Are you referring to Tang Bingchen's daughter?

7
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,330
They probably know each other.

8
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:56,920
Telegraph room.

9
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,780
Send a telegram to Inoue Kamakura

10
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,240
telling him to mind his own business.

11
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,960
That colonel

12
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,090
carries a personal letter from His Majesty the Emperor.

13
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,280
Someone of this importance

14
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,560
is better left alone.

15
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,560
Did you hear me?

16
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,480
Has my father sent a reply?

17
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,640
Yes, he has.

18
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,600
What did he say?

19
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,880
Mr. Inoue Akira says that imperial investigator

20
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,480
carries a personal letter from His Majesty the Emperor.

21
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,440
You'd better stay away from someone like him.

22
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,000
You can't do this.

23
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Are you really sanding the propeller with sandpaper?

24
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,020
Do you want to try doing my job?

25
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:19,240
I work three shifts a day.

26
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:21,800
There are hundreds of planes waiting for maintenance.

27
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,440
You're lucky I can fix yours

28
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,440
right now.

29
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,640
Sir,

30
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,800
we mean no disrespect.

31
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,920
We've shown you

32
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,760
General Arnold's orders.

33
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,690
These planes need to be finished as soon as possible.

34
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,600
Could you please stop?

35
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:34,560
Do you realize

36
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,680
we're flying across the Pacific Ocean?

37
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,280
If you keep scraping with sandpaper,

38
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,480
the salt will cause the prop tips to curl up.

39
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,640
The Pacific.

40
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,920
Finally someone tells me.

41
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,800
Where are these things going?

42
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:47,079
None of your business.

43
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,880
Listen.

44
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,360
If the commander really wants to do this,

45
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,280
I might have just the solution you're looking for.

46
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,200
Modifying these planes.

47
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,120
But right now,

48
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,560
my job is to

49
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,960
do all this pointless work.

50
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,400
Fine.

51
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,920
Look at the scratches you made on the propeller.

52
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,720
Apply some oil and smooth it out.

53
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,580
Thanks.

54
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,240
Wake up, boys!

55
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,240
We're moving out.

56
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,800
March 28, 1942.

57
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,880
Doolittle Bomber Squadron

58
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,000
transferred to Sacramento for training.

59
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,560
Dr. Ozu

60
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,920
Private Kaixin,

61
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,600
it seems worse than yesterday.

62
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,420
Do you want to check it out?

63
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,360
Got it.

64
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,480
Tang Ju'er

65
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,520
What are you doing?

66
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,720
Let's go.

67
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,560
We're going to the comfort station.

68
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,920
Wait. I'll take you there.

69
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,040
I heard you've been looking for this book.

70
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,159
I specially asked my friend in Shanghai to find it.

71
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:58,490
I brought it back hoping you would like it.

72
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,480
I've been looking for this book.

73
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Thank you so much.

74
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,290
Have you read this book?

75
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:07,420
Yes, I have.

76
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,780
What do you think of it?

77
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,200
This amazing American author

78
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,880
when writing this book in 1921

79
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,640
already predicted

80
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,560
that Japan would from the North Pacific

81
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,320
launch a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor.

82
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:21,520
Admiral Yamamoto Isoroku

83
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,600
when he was a military attaché in America

84
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,800
I believe before he made this decision

85
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,760
Everyone must have read this book.

86
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,640
Colonel,

87
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,880
I'm convinced by you.

88
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,720
You're a man of wisdom close to the Emperor.

89
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,520
You've always been able to grasp

90
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,780
the pulse of those generals' decisions.

91
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,560
I always have people find books for me afterwards,

92
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,200
so I can only serve as a Lieutenant General out here.

93
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,840
I'm just a Colonel now.

94
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:45,920
No, no, no.

95
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,840
You will become a general.

96
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,540
You flatter me.

97
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:51,000
By the way,

98
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,080
Commander,

99
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,540
there's something I'd like to ask of you.

100
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,440
What is it?

101
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:58,280
I've been ordered

102
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,840
to investigate General Minoo Tsunaki's plane crash.

103
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,760
On the island,

104
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,320
I need a unit to assist me.

105
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,160
The Special Police Unit

106
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,240
has very close ties

107
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,360
with the Shanghai garrison.

108
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,320
So they can't be fully trusted.

109
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,560
General Tsunaki was previously in the Navy,

110
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,560
so I hope you

111
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,880
can assign a unit from the Navy

112
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,600
to assist me with my work.

113
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,920
The officers don't need to be high-ranking,

114
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,800
but preferably this unit

115
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,160
should avoid having members of the Southern Expansion Doctrine

116
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,220
or the Northern Expansion Doctrine.

117
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:25,760
Colonel,

118
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,760
don't take those

119
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,440
Special Police Unit fellows seriously.

120
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,000
They're just a bunch of watchdogs

121
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,600
who bark at whoever comes in.

122
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,919
In my Marine Corps,

123
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,840
there's an anti-aircraft artillery company.

124
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,880
Their main duty is

125
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,679
to guard the ports and airports.

126
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,280
The Chinese forces have no air superiority,

127
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:43,940
so they haven't had much to do.

128
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,800
Except for those on standby duty,

129
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,660
you can deploy this unit anytime.

130
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:48,840
Excellent.

131
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,240
Then tomorrow I'll establish

132
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,240
my investigation headquarters at the anti-aircraft company.

133
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,520
Let Adjutant Sakamoto arrange your accommodations first.

134
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,280
Tomorrow,

135
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,200
I'll notify all department heads at the headquarters

136
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,280
to hold a welcome dinner for you.

137
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,400
The commander of the anti-aircraft company

138
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,160
is Lieutenant Akiyokawa Ken.

139
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,480
I'll have him come to meet you.

140
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,320
Thank you.

141
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:22,920
Xiao Zhu.

142
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,280
Is the examination over?

143
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:26,860
Not yet.

144
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,240
Come over here,

145
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,370
I need to talk to you.

146
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,160
Hurry up.

147
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,020
Bring the medical kit.

148
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,240
Who did this?

149
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:10,560
Come here,

150
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,480
check her condition.

151
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,340
You didn't use any inappropriate methods, did you?

152
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,880
I swear

153
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,240
Absolutely not.

154
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,840
Then why did Ye Degong refuse?

155
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,440
Sir.

156
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:43,960
If I may be so bold,

157
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,240
aren't we being too polite to these people?

158
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,560
Are you questioning me?

159
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,010
I wouldn't dare.

160
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,200
Let me tell you again.

161
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,050
The key to governance lies in thought and spirit.

162
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,440
Instead of physical torture.

163
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,880
Ye Degong is the tribal chief of this island.

164
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,360
If we conquer him,

165
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,580
we conquer the entire Sanzao Island.

166
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:11,930
Understood.

167
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,720
What do you think about the newly arrived Major?

168
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,120
Well...

169
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,800
What I've been worried about has finally happened.

170
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,440
General, you mean...

171
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,240
The plane crash of General Minao Ōsumi last year

172
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,440
caused quite a stir

173
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,360
and alarmed the Emperor.

174
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,360
Due to Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe's resignation,

175
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,060
the investigation was temporarily suspended.

176
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:50,360
Unexpectedly, they've now reopened the investigation.

177
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,600
Could it be that

178
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,240
the Major came here for this matter?

179
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,970
He not only wants to clarify

180
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,720
the real cause of General Ōsumi's accident,

181
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,580
but also to find

182
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,360
the confidential documents lost in the accident that only the Emperor,

183
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,360
the Prime Minister, and the Army and Navy leaders

184
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,690
are allowed to possess.

185
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,680
General, are you concerned that this matter

186
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,360
might implicate

187
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,280
officers from our Sixth Air Base?

188
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:15,720
As you know,

189
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,380
the Navy and Army have been constantly feuding.

190
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,560
General Ōsumi

191
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,640
had already narrowly escaped several assassination attempts.

192
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,880
Why did this time

193
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,340
it happen specifically in my jurisdiction?

194
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,160
Sir,

195
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,680
please don't worry too much.

196
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,280
It might simply be an accident

197
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,700
that has nothing to do with us.

198
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,920
We can't rule out that it was done by those

199
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,180
hot-headed radicals under our command.

200
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,320
If the Major discovers any connection to us

201
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,780
and places the blame on us,

202
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,160
I'll become the target of everyone's arrows.

203
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,200
Our Sixth Air Base

204
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,260
won't enjoy peace and quiet anymore.

205
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,280
While we assist the Major in his investigation,

206
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,450
we must also gather necessary intelligence.

207
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:03,770
During his time on this island,

208
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,040
we need to be extra cautious.

209
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,060
This is where the doctor sits.

210
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,260
Have a seat.

211
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,450
Please sit down.

212
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:31,900
Hold tight.

213
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,680
Hold on tight.

214
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,160
Biying.

215
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:01,680
Biying.

216
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,000
Hello.

217
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,520
My name is Wumu Yilang.

218
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,120
Nice to meet you.

219
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,930
I'm here to drop off Biying's luggage.

220
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,720
Please come in.

221
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,120
Yingying.

222
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,120
What are you doing here?

223
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,440
I brought your luggage back.

224
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,040
I just calmed my father down.

225
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,080
And now you're here making trouble.

226
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:38,880
Who's here?

227
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,080
Master.

228
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,400
You need to come with me.

229
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,160
Hurry up.

230
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:43,690
- Go.
- Go.

231
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,440
Mr. Ye.

232
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,050
What are you doing here?

233
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,580
I brought Biying's luggage back.

234
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,610
Put it there.

235
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,200
You may leave now.

236
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:57,920
Mr. Ye,

237
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,640
I'm sorry for the disturbance today.

238
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,720
Please accept my apologies.

239
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,160
Your country's soldiers always act this way,

240
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,240
with complete disregard for justice and morality.

241
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:07,760
Vulgar

242
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,200
and reckless.

243
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,400
You're right, Mr. Ye.

244
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,200
Some soldiers indeed

245
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,960
behave in vulgar and reckless ways.

246
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,690
I'm also very angry about this.

247
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,520
I heard that you, Mr. Ye,

248
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,180
were once a consul in America.

249
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,760
You must be well-versed in diplomatic affairs

250
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,240
and extremely knowledgeable.

251
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,900
I hope to have the opportunity to learn from you.

252
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,200
Sipo,

253
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:29,690
show him out.

254
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:30,840
Mr. Ye.

255
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,570
I don't want to know who you are.

256
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,560
Our family doesn't want anything to do

257
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,880
with you, a Japanese man in uniform,

258
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,840
whatsoever.

259
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,960
Stop bothering my daughter.

260
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:39,880
Please leave.

261
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,280
But I need to take

262
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,200
Ye Biying out to handle something.

263
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:42,800
Leave now.

264
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:43,760
Takemuro,

265
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:44,720
please go quickly.

266
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:45,720
I'm not leaving.

267
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,160
Father,

268
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,740
how about this:

269
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:52,740
I'll see him out

270
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,020
and come back soon.

271
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:54,850
Let's go.

272
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:55,970
Ying'er.

273
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,060
Father,

274
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,160
I'll be back soon.

275
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,320
Please rest well.

276
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,370
Ying'er.

277
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,290
Are you trying to get me killed?

278
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,140
Nurse Tang.

279
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,319
What's wrong?

280
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,839
Why are you so flustered?

281
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,880
Nothing.

282
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,290
Did something happen at the hospital?

283
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,040
I went to the comfort station for routine inspection today.

284
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,000
I saw Huihui.

285
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:24,560
Father.

286
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,119
Can you think of a way?

287
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:27,800
Why don't we

288
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,760
rescue Huihui?

289
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,280
You

290
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,600
stop right there.

291
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:32,260
Don't even think about it.

292
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,450
You haven't seen how miserable she is.

293
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,480
Ju'er.

294
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,780
We can't get involved in this.

295
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,610
You can't do anything about it.

296
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,920
If you want to blame someone,

297
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,920
blame her father and her brother.

298
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,960
Why did they have to

299
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,520
attack Japanese soldiers?

300
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,960
Whose world is this now?

301
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,600
It's the Japanese people's world.

302
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,720
If the Japanese don't punish her,

303
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,920
who will they punish?

304
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:56,880
Ju'er.

305
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,040
Your father now works for the Japanese.

306
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:01,240
And why is that?

307
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,640
It's for our family,

308
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,320
so we can live

309
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,200
safely and peacefully.

310
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,180
You should understand your father's good intentions.

311
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:13,610
Alright.

312
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,080
Dad, dinner's ready.

313
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:15,720
Let's eat.

314
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,120
I'm going out for a while.

315
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,000
Where are you going?

316
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
I'll be back soon.

317
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,600
Wumu must verify

318
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,160
all information about Ye Biying

319
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,720
in the Special Police Unit.

320
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,920
He needs to find out what the island's special police

321
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,760
actually know

322
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,440
and make an accurate judgment for the next step.

323
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,490
Today is really an unlucky day.

324
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,120
I originally planned

325
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,280
that my first task upon arriving on the island

326
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,410
would be to do my best

327
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,840
to establish good relations with the Special Police Unit.

328
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,880
After all, the security on the island

329
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,680
is under their responsibility.

330
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:51,880
Without them knowing,

331
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,920
it would be easier for us to locate

332
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,650
and rescue the American pilot.

333
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,560
But with all this commotion now,

334
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,040
they have certainly

335
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,770
made me their number one enemy.

336
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,400
A discreet entry to the island

337
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,060
has turned into a high-profile rescue mission.

338
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,520
Don't just keep walking.

339
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,360
Tell me about

340
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,160
what happened at the Special Police Unit today.

341
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,360
What did they ask you?

342
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,700
What did you tell them?

343
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,440
I need to know all the details you can remember.

344
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,450
Do you really have to ask me about this now?

345
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:33,320
My head is a complete mess right now.

346
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,560
I get scared just thinking about it.

347
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:36,810
If you don't tell me,

348
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:37,880
I can't assess

349
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,480
the danger we're facing now.

350
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,040
Do you have any idea

351
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,700
what I've been through today?

352
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,200
I was finally so happy,

353
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,600
thinking I could go home.

354
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,840
As soon as I got on the boat, there were torpedoes

355
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,800
and gunfire.

356
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,240
I nearly died at sea.

357
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,300
Do you understand?

358
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,250
I was pulled out of the water

359
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,640
only to be taken to the police station

360
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,770
for interrogation.

361
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,840
My father got dragged into this too.

362
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:56,960
I finally got out.

363
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,160
People stared at me the whole way, looking like a mess,

364
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,620
pointing and whispering.

365
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,760
Even my father doesn't understand me.

366
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,920
And all of this is because of you,

367
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:04,720
Wu Mu-Yilong.

368
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,540
Someone's coming.

369
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:34,840
Stop playing.

370
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,040
Let's go home.

371
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,600
All of you go home now.

372
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,400
Stop playing.

373
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,400
Let's go.

374
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:41,960
Hurry up.

375
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,360
Don't leave.

376
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,080
Don't go.

377
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:51,920
Kewen.

378
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,600
It's me.

379
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,520
Biying.

380
00:20:58,680 --> 00:20:59,400
Ying.

381
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:02,960
You're back.

382
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,320
What happened

383
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,520
to you?

384
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,800
The sun.

385
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:14,440
The sun.

386
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,080
Chase the sun.

387
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,560
Where are you going?

388
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,280
The sun.

389
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,320
Where are you going?

390
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:19,800
Kewen

391
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:20,730
Chasing the Sun.

392
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:21,960
Kewen.

393
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,890
Chasing the Sun.

394
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:24,720
Kewen.

395
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,320
Kewen.

396
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:28,690
Chasing the Sun.

397
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:29,640
Kewen

398
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:30,570
Chasing the Sun.

399
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,400
Chasing the Sun.

400
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,880
The sun. The sun.

401
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,840
I want the sun.

402
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,320
Ju'er

403
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,520
Sorry I'm late.

404
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:56,920
Why are you so late?

405
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,640
Today is the regular inspection day at the comfort station.

406
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,900
Where's the medicine?

407
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,530
Is medicine all you care about?

408
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,180
Here you go.

409
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,600
Alright, I'm leaving.

410
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,000
You're leaving already?

411
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,660
What is it? Anything else?

412
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,320
Is this medicine

413
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,690
more important than me?

414
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,040
No.

415
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,900
You're hiding something from me.

416
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:22,660
No, I'm not.

417
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,040
Japanese soldiers came to my house today.

418
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,560
They turned the place upside down.

419
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:29,040
My father got sick from anger over this.

420
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,200
Your father is sick

421
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,010
and you still look so happy?

422
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,330
Ying'er is back.

423
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,800
Ying'er is back?

424
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:39,210
I can't say more.

425
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,570
I'm not good with words.

426
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,080
I'll tell you when I figure it out.

427
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:42,680
I have to go now.

428
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,340
Be careful.

429
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,000
Tang Ju'er!

430
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,800
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

431
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,140
Less than an hour on the island

432
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,920
and both guns are already in someone else's hands.

433
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,040
Your experience as an agent

434
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,200
is quite legendary.

435
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:42,560
Keep these safe

436
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:44,020
and don't lose them again.

437
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,240
Let me go! Let me go!

438
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,400
What are you doing?

439
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,400
Let me go!

440
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,360
Stay away!

441
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,240
Let me go!

442
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,000
Listen to me.

443
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:15,960
Let go of me!

444
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,240
I really like you.

445
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,080
Let go of me!

446
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,480
Stop running!

447
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,160
Let me go!

448
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:32,600
Let go of me!

449
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,000
Stay here and don't move.

450
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,240
I have work to do.

451
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,440
Let go of me!

452
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,280
Let me go!

453
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,860
As a soldier of the Empire,

454
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,120
I'm truly ashamed of you.

455
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,360
Colonel,

456
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,000
to be honest,

457
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,280
I'm currently on a mission.

458
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,320
What mission?

459
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,400
The mission of pinning

460
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,840
a woman beneath you?

461
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,320
Do you know that with my authority,

462
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,200
I could shoot you right now?

463
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,800
Colonel.

464
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,960
Take him back to the police station.

465
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,720
Lock him up.

466
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,620
I'll be there shortly.

467
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,690
I can walk by myself.

468
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,840
I'm sorry.

469
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:01,640
What happened?

470
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:06,680
Ju'er.

471
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:07,320
Ju'er.

472
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,120
Ju'er.

473
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,680
Ying'er.

474
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,600
Ying'er.

475
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,920
It's okay.

476
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:25,840
It's fine.

477
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,290
Everything's alright.

478
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,180
Stop grabbing me all the time.

479
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:41,000
That guy ruined my plans.

480
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,240
Just let me ride the bicycle by myself.

481
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,640
Captain, wait!

482
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,700
I'm going to talk to Wumu for a moment.

483
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,900
I'll be right back.

484
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,780
What's that woman's name?

485
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,000
Tang Ju'er.

486
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,000
How much does she know about you?

487
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,720
We grew up together.

488
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,410
We studied together in Guangzhou.

489
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,760
Does she know you went to Yan'an?

490
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:38,560
Yes.

491
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,560
Inoue Kamakura is after you.

492
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,480
He's investigating your social connections.

493
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,740
Tell me all the details

494
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,500
about your time at school.

495
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:53,080
Back when I was studying at the women's college in Guangzhou,

496
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,880
she was at nursing school there.

497
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,130
We spent a lot of time together.

498
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,560
But later I went to Yan'an,

499
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,620
then to Chongqing,

500
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,080
and we lost touch.

501
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,800
The special police unit on the island,

502
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,930
if they find out you've been to Yan'an,

503
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,200
such an important lead,

504
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,330
they won't let it go.

505
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,530
If they follow this thread,

506
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,460
we'll soon be exposed.

507
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,680
What should we do?

508
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,730
Find a way to plug this leak.

509
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,220
You're not planning to silence her, are you?

510
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,160
I will if necessary.

511
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,560
Unless...

512
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:29,920
you tell her

513
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,240
that you never went to Yan'an,

514
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,560
that you've been in Shanghai all these years.

515
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,690
Make her believe it.

516
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,340
Can you do that?

517
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,940
Who else knows about this?

518
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,360
My father and Long Xia.

519
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,040
You're not planning to silence them too, are you?

520
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:49,640
Wumu Yilang.

521
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,640
Go talk to her now.

522
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:03,600
Ju'er.

523
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,280
What's wrong with me?

524
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,250
What did that Japanese man say?

525
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,240
I...

526
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,280
We...

527
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,120
After we separated in Guangzhou,

528
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,420
I was planning to go to Yan'an.

529
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,600
But then,

530
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,240
I couldn't make it. There was fighting everywhere.

531
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,760
So I eventually made my way to Shanghai.

532
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,200
You didn't go to Yan'an?

533
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,480
No, I didn't.

534
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,520
In Shanghai,

535
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,340
I had to make a living in Shanghai.

536
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:34,440
I had no choice,

537
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,240
so I started working at a dance hall.

538
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,600
That's where I met him.

539
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,040
Ying'er,

540
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,120
you didn't...

541
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:42,920
Please don't tell my family about this.

542
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,540
Don't tell anyone.

543
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,240
This time,

544
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,880
Wumu was coming to Sanzao Island for a mission.

545
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,120
He knew I was from Sanzao Island too,

546
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,580
so he brought me back here.

547
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,520
Anyway,

548
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,840
thank you for saving me.

549
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,240
That Inoue Kamakura

550
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,180
is a very powerful man on this island.

551
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,440
You must be careful around him.

552
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,240
I know.

553
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,880
He's the one who captured me when I arrived on the island.

554
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,280
He also interrogated me.

555
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,040
That Inoue Kamakura

556
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:24,280
is the most evil person.

557
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,840
It's alright now.

558
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,240
Ju'er.

559
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,330
There's one more thing.

560
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:36,580
From now on,

561
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,840
if anyone asks about me,

562
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,700
just say you don't know anything.

563
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:43,920
Okay?

564
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,460
This is important.

565
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,400
What I'm telling you now is very important.

566
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,530
You must promise me.

567
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,560
Don't cry now.

568
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,370
Stop crying.

569
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,920
Sasaki.

570
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,320
This is my territory.

571
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:36,840
In front of my adorable subordinates,

572
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,970
pointing a gun at my head. You bastard!

573
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,400
For 15 years,

574
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,400
no one has dared to disrespect me like this.

575
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,000
And all for a Chinese woman.

576
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,720
You've noticed that too.

577
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:52,360
I won't let this go.

578
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:12,580
Do you remember what I told you today?

579
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,080
Mr. Tang.

580
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:19,410
Miss.

581
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,890
I heard you're back.

582
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,360
Who's that?

583
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,200
What happened to Ju'er?

584
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:30,880
Don't ask.

585
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,160
Go see her quickly.

586
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,200
Okay.

587
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:34,800
Ju'er.

588
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:44,680
Ju'er.

589
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:47,400
Ju'er!

590
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:49,640
What's wrong?

591
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,860
What happened?

592
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,580
Did someone bully you?

593
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:55,440
Was it Long Xia?

594
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:57,880
No.

595
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,720
Was it the Japanese?

596
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,200
Japanese?

597
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:10,540
Which Japanese person

598
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,680
dared to bully our family?

599
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,440
Tell me who it was.

600
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,050
I'll go to Captain Inoue

601
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,320
and ask him to help us.

602
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,090
What's going on?

603
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,050
Are you trying to worry me to death?

604
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,660
The one who bullied your daughter

605
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,240
is Captain Inoue himself.

606
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:10,170
Let's stop here.

607
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:15,040
I'll drop you off here then.

608
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,120
I need to go to the police station anyway.

609
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,000
What are you going to do at the police station?

610
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,080
You don't quite understand the Japanese character.

611
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,080
They're all trained to face failure.

612
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,239
So when it comes to something,

613
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,699
they never give up easily.

614
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,400
So what are you going to do?

615
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,320
What I can do

616
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:30,480
is to quickly start

617
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,480
investigating Dakaku Mineo's plane crash,

618
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,199
bring you into my work system,

619
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,820
and clear your suspicion.

620
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,969
Starting tomorrow,

621
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,120
you need to start visiting people

622
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,239
and try to get

623
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,560
information about the messenger from the villagers.

624
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,360
I understand.

625
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,280
The Special Police Unit

626
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,340
won't dare to investigate me openly.

627
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:49,920
But their investigation of you,

628
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:51,560
although we disrupted it today,

629
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,960
they still won't give up.

630
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,530
So you must be very careful.

631
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:55,940
What should we do then?

632
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,480
I'm going to the police station now

633
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,040
to put some pressure on them.

634
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,520
Hopefully under pressure,

635
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,120
they'll postpone their investigation of you.

636
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:03,920
But if they

637
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,520
keep focusing on Tang Ju'er,

638
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:06,600
for us,

639
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,760
that's the most dangerous sign.

640
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,960
I've instructed her.

641
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,600
She won't say anything.

642
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,400
Let's hope so.

643
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,530
After you go back today,

644
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,000
have a good talk with your father

645
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
and try to ease the tension with him.

646
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,160
We need a stable base,

647
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,040
so that we can

648
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,440
find the messenger's whereabouts faster.

649
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:25,880
I know.

650
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:26,760
Go now.

651
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,090
I'll come pick you up tomorrow.

652
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:55,770
Here, Major.

653
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,940
Have something to eat.

654
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:04,040
There was a lot of commotion outside today.

655
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,300
Seems we can't stay here much longer.

656
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,280
I've already sent word

657
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,260
to Macau about your whereabouts.

658
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,920
They'll find a way to contact the Nationalist government

659
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,980
and send someone as soon as possible.

660
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:22,760
Good.

661
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,120
But there's one problem now.

662
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,740
My daughter has returned.

663
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,840
Your daughter coming back at this time -

664
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:40,300
could she be connected to the Nationalist government?

665
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:44,180
She couldn't possibly have any dealings with them.

666
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,400
The problem is

667
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,640
she's returned with a Japanese officer.

668
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,650
A Japanese officer?

669
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:56,360
That is troublesome.

670
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:00,280
All right.

671
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,080
I'll handle this matter.

672
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:03,960
You should rest well.

673
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,220
Have something to eat.

674
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,650
Mother-in-law.

675
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,940
Is Dad still angry with me?

676
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,000
He's just upset

677
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,820
for the moment. It'll be fine.

678
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,170
Mother-in-law.

679
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,560
I bought a gift for Dad.

680
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:32,360
That's nice.

681
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,480
Should I give it to him now

682
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,810
or wait until tomorrow?

683
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,360
How about this:

684
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:37,880
could you give it to him for me later?

685
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,680
You should give it to him yourself.

686
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,160
I'm afraid he's still mad at me.

687
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:40,760
Ying'er.

688
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:41,760
Come here.

689
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,200
It's alright. Go on.

690
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,080
Dad.

691
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,880
Auntie, please sit.

692
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,250
Do you think you deserve to sit?

693
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:26,010
The whole family is here today.

694
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,200
So in front of everyone,

695
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,850
explain yourself clearly.

696
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,760
What exactly is your relationship

697
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,360
with that Japanese officer?

698
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:36,120
Wumu.

699
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,780
He is a good person.

700
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:40,520
Wumu?

701
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,320
I don't care if he's good or bad.

702
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,360
I just want you to tell me

703
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,690
how you came to know him.

704
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,920
How long have you known him?

705
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,600
How far has your relationship progressed?

706
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,160
It's not what you think between us.

707
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:49,760
Yingying,

708
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:52,140
speak properly to your father

709
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,080
and don't make him angry.

710
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,640
Didn't you go north to pursue your ideals

711
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,840
and your principles?

712
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,360
How did you end up involved with that Japanese man?

713
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,600
And what about that gun?

714
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:06,560
Father,

715
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:08,960
I was mistreated

716
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,740
by the Japanese police this morning.

717
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,880
Could you please not interrogate me

718
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,200
like they did?

719
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,640
Ying'er just came back today

720
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,200
and was already mistreated at the police station.

721
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,360
Why don't you let her rest

722
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,160
and talk about this tomorrow?

723
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:22,760
Shut up!

724
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,880
Your sister's actions today

725
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,360
have brought shame to our entire family.

726
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,840
She has put our family in a position

727
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,440
where everyone points fingers and criticizes us.

728
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,240
And you're still defending her?

729
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,090
Sit down!

730
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,450
All information about this person

731
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,880
is top secret.

732
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,400
I swear

733
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,330
that about this person,

734
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,160
I won't say a single word.

735
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,610
Will you talk or not?

736
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:47,760
Yingying.

737
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,160
Um, Yingying...

738
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,500
Didn't you buy a gift for your father?

739
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,240
Quick, take it out.

740
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,200
Quickly, take it out.

741
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,540
Give it to your father.

742
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,560
Sir, please don't be angry anymore.

743
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:00,880
Look,

744
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,640
Yingying even bought you a gift.

745
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,160
Look.

746
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:06,180
Hurry, bring it to the master.

747
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:07,880
Dad,

748
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,080
this is for you.

749
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,610
Are you going to talk or not?

750
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,360
If you don't explain clearly,

751
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:18,820
then get out of this house!

752
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,800
Fine, I'll leave!

753
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,600
Go follow your sister.

754
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,660
Don't let her meet that Japanese man.

755
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:37,200
Auntie, you go too.

756
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,280
If she refuses to come back,

757
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,920
let her stay at your place for the night.

758
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:41,920
Keep her company.

759
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:42,280
Alright.

760
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:42,920
Hurry up.

761
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:43,610
Okay.

762
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,280
Dad is so angry.

763
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,360
What should we do?

764
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,320
You have no idea.

765
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,840
During the years you've been gone,

766
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,000
these Japanese came to the island

767
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,800
and did so many terrible things.

768
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:01,240
Later, Uncle wanted me and Dad to go to Macau,

769
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,200
but Dad absolutely refused.

770
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,680
Just look at yourself.

771
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,680
Today, actually,

772
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,280
Dad wasn't angry at you when he said those things.

773
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,600
He was angry at the Japanese.

774
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,400
I mean, really,

775
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,960
you even brought a Japanese person to our home.

776
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,360
How could he not be angry?

777
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:16,160
I didn't want to either,

778
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,820
but I had no choice.

779
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,090
We had to come together.

780
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,460
What are you doing?

781
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:28,880
I got it.

782
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:31,920
You're not as simple as you seem.
