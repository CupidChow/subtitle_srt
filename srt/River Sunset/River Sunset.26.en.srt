1
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,000
Why are you asking about this?

2
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,720
The only thing I'm certain of now

3
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:38,960
is that Colonel Wumu

4
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,039
graduated from Shanghai Tongwen Academy

5
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:47,920
and was likely a protégé of former Prime Minister Konoe Fumimaro.

6
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,320
I see.

7
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,000
Prime Minister Konoe's investigation agencies

8
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,479
all belong to the Cabinet Intelligence Bureau.

9
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,759
Some others belong to

10
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,240
the Konoe family's private investigation agencies.

11
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:02,800
For example,

12
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,520
there's the one located in Shanghai Broadway Building,

13
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,960
the East Asia Political and Economic Research Institute,

14
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,600
and the one on Sichuan Road,

15
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,080
the Shanghai East Asia Investigation Association.

16
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:11,720
Also,

17
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,160
the Nishu Research Institute headed by Fukamachi Sakuji,

18
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,560
president of the Mainichi Newspaper,

19
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,840
and the Yamazaki Research Institute

20
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,170
run by Tateishi Shunzo.

21
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,480
All these institutions belong to them.

22
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:25,120
What about the Cabinet Secretary's Office system?

23
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,280
The system?

24
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,200
These are all just rumors.

25
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,000
The Shanghai Koua Patriotic Association,

26
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
the East Asia Common Culture Association Shanghai Branch,

27
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,320
the Tokyo Common Culture Academy Investigation Association,

28
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,800
the Shanghai Municipal Research Association and others,

29
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,600
are all said to be

30
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,360
Prime Minister Konoe Fumimaro's

31
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,360
privately controlled investigation agencies.

32
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,690
I'm not quite clear about their missions.

33
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,600
The intelligence from these agencies

34
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:54,520
is never reported to the military or the Imperial Headquarters.

35
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,960
I see.

36
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,280
Mr. Oshima.

37
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,520
I think you might be

38
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,200
overthinking this matter.

39
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,600
Let me give you an idea.

40
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,880
Do you remember the Ministry of Finance's

41
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:13,720
Deputy Secretary Tae Shuichi?

42
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,720
Section Six.

43
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,680
He currently

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,800
oversees all budgets for Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department.

45
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,560
He's the money man for the police department.

46
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,840
Send him a telegram

47
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,600
asking him to dispatch an official

48
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,200
from Section Six of the police department.

49
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,730
Wouldn't that get this matter off your hands?

50
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,400
Section Six.

51
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,260
Counterintelligence Division.

52
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,000
If this Colonel Takeki

53
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
really has issues,

54
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,400
it would be the police department's achievement if they uncover it.

55
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,240
If the investigation is wrong,

56
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,640
then it's obviously their mistake.

57
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,360
I see.

58
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,960
Eat more.

59
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,960
All right.

60
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,800
Everything tastes good.

61
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,960
I was careless.

62
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:30,880
I didn't notice his motorcycle

63
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,940
parked in the yard.

64
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,970
Can your body handle it?

65
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,640
No problem.

66
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:45,960
Is it okay?

67
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,000
Come with Ju'er

68
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,400
and help me push the vehicle.

69
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:44,930
JUN08596

70
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,490
JUN08596

71
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,680
Sit tight.

72
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,800
Push harder.

73
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,760
Yes.

74
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:00,040
Open the front for me.

75
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,120
Help me hold this side.

76
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,480
Yes,

77
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,210
hold it here.

78
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,040
What are you looking at?

79
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,640
Hurry up.

80
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,360
Yes.

81
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:22,760
Close it.

82
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,530
Go help me push the vehicle.

83
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,570
Put some effort into it.

84
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,040
Find a safe place to hide.

85
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,160
Wait for us here.

86
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,020
We'll be back as soon as possible.

87
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,760
Comfort Tang Ju'er.

88
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:42,890
Tell her to be brave.

89
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,240
I'll be back soon.

90
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,520
Let's go, Weite.

91
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,160
There's an aircraft signal tower on the mountaintop.

92
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,280
It's staffed during the day but not at night.

93
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,480
Behind the mountain is a camp barracks.

94
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,740
This place is relatively the safest.

95
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,320
Can you hold on?

96
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,040
I can manage.

97
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:19,200
Come on.

98
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,360
I'll go get Xia'er.

99
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,290
No need, Auntie Si. Please sit.

100
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,480
This Xia'er...

101
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,520
He has no appetite at all.

102
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,720
Hasn't eaten a single grain of rice since morning.

103
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,840
I'm worried he'll make himself sick.

104
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,360
Auntie Si.

105
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,970
Look at that flower.

106
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:54,320
People are just like flowers.

107
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,460
Take this flower for example.

108
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,320
If you don't water it daily,

109
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,080
don't take good care of it,

110
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,480
with just a little neglect,

111
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,610
it will wither away.

112
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,520
And then,

113
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:08,400
you'll regret

114
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,520
not cherishing it

115
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,960
when it was in full bloom.

116
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,240
I understand Xia'er's thinking.

117
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,640
He always sees the bigger picture,

118
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,200
always thinking of others first.

119
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,160
But,

120
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,770
regarding his feelings for Ju'er,

121
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,060
he's overthinking it.

122
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,200
However, neither I

123
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,200
nor Tang Bingchen

124
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,040
have the right to interfere.

125
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,730
Young people's affairs

126
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,380
should be decided by themselves.

127
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,600
Sir.

128
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:47,560
Why don't you tell Long Xia that?

129
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,080
A young man

130
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,680
needs to grow on his own,

131
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,580
experience life himself,

132
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,900
only then will he understand.

133
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,480
Your son

134
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:15,320
is someone only you truly understand.

135
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:16,880
Eat.

136
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,240
Why aren't they back yet?

137
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,570
I hope nothing's happened.

138
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,840
Don't worry.

139
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,920
Wumu is the most reliable person

140
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,930
who knows exactly what he's doing.

141
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,400
Wumu is great.

142
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,760
If only

143
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,720
he weren't Japanese.

144
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,200
Ju'er.

145
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,650
Don't take what my brother said

146
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,720
last night to heart.

147
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,920
He didn't mean it.

148
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,400
How can I not think that way?

149
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:18,960
He doesn't like that

150
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,620
I work at a Japanese hospital.

151
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,680
He doesn't like my father

152
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,010
being the chairman of the Puppet Council.

153
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,880
But what choice do my father

154
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,120
and I have?

155
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,610
Your brother can't treat me like this.

156
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,000
After he said those things,

157
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,330
he deeply regretted it.

158
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:37,600
He...

159
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,400
He really didn't mean it.

160
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,520
Those were just words spoken in anger.

161
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,380
Words in anger?

162
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:43,970
How can you treat

163
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,920
this matter so lightly?

164
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,400
My father was wrong to make such a scene.

165
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,160
But he shouldn't have agreed so easily.

166
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,880
If he truly cared about me,

167
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,770
he wouldn't have so readily agreed

168
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,720
to break off our engagement.

169
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,120
Without our engagement,

170
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,680
there's nothing

171
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,240
between us anymore.

172
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,520
Ju'er.

173
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,970
Don't say such things in anger either.

174
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,480
Let's do this.

175
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,410
I'll go back and talk to my brother.

176
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:23,960
He really didn't mean it.

177
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,380
You have to believe me.

178
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,740
Don't you believe me anymore?

179
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,090
[Star 08596]

180
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,200
It's them.

181
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,960
They're back.

182
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,080
Are you okay?

183
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,570
Come up quickly.

184
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,320
Thank you, Nurse Tang.

185
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,200
When we go back to the hospital later,

186
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,040
try to relax

187
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,120
just like usual.

188
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:08,920
Is that okay?

189
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:12,160
Let's go.

190
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,520
Be careful.

191
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,540
Looks like the talk went well.

192
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:34,360
Let's go.

193
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,650
Are they all asleep?

194
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,960
Help me, please.

195
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,280
Thank you.

196
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,680
Nurse Tang.

197
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,200
Nurse Tang.

198
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,600
Can I talk to you?

199
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,120
Are you still thinking about

200
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,960
what happened this afternoon?

201
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:02,360
Yes.

202
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:08,380
My mind is filled with images from today.

203
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,780
No matter how busy I am,

204
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,000
scene after scene

205
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,720
keeps flashing through my mind.

206
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,599
Are you scared?

207
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,319
You're a nurse.

208
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,400
You should know that

209
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,530
when people are under extreme stress,

210
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,000
the limbic brain mobilizes

211
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,280
all body systems

212
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,800
to freeze your memories.

213
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,480
Those scenes flashing

214
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,160
through your mind

215
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,000
will make you even more panicked

216
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,450
when you encounter others.

217
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,760
Yes.

218
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,080
I know.

219
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,480
What should I do?

220
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,960
I need you to

221
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,130
forget what happened this afternoon.

222
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,560
Forget that hateful Jingshang Kancang.

223
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,160
I want to forget too,

224
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,400
but I just can't.

225
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,840
Nurse Tang,

226
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,840
do you know what we use

227
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:10,440
to strengthen our memories?

228
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,080
We rely on association.

229
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,360
If

230
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,640
we need to quickly forget

231
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,480
certain things,

232
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,080
we also rely on association.

233
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,520
We force ourselves

234
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,480
to think about family,

235
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,920
parents,

236
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,400
and the people we love.

237
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,560
Or our future.

238
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,040
We imagine every step

239
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,080
and every detail of what we'll do.

240
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,280
This way we can gradually forget

241
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,520
the things we want to forget.

242
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,780
But I don't want to think about my father.

243
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:09,000
Thinking of him

244
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,680
also troubles me.

245
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,640
Brother Longxia,

246
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,520
we have many reasons

247
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,520
why we can't be together.

248
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,520
Nurse Tang, listen to me.

249
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,360
Don't think about those

250
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,000
reasons keeping you apart.

251
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:37,000
Force yourself

252
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,200
to imagine

253
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,840
your future together.

254
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,840
Think about your life

255
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,520
after the Japanese leave.

256
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,160
The more detailed, the better.

257
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,840
This way you'll gradually forget

258
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,690
what happened this afternoon.

259
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,840
Ye Longxia,

260
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:00,840
I've met him.

261
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,560
He's a good man.

262
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,760
You'll be happy together.

263
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,840
I can see you really like him.

264
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:13,880
Since you like him,

265
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,280
don't worry about those reasons.

266
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,080
You should bravely pursue this.

267
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,040
I hope you can have this love.

268
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,480
I'll be wishing you well.

269
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,160
I also hope

270
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,880
to have such a chance.

271
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,080
You will.

272
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,680
Someday.

273
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,920
If I have other questions

274
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,240
can I come to you as well?

275
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,360
Of course.

276
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,120
If you have any questions,

277
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,580
you can come to me anytime.

278
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,960
Get some rest then.

279
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,480
All right.

280
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,600
Thank you.

281
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,480
Colonel.

282
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,480
The reason I came to see you

283
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,680
is that I have another matter to discuss.

284
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:27,480
What is it?

285
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,480
We've made a plan.

286
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:31,520
The plan is for April 12th,

287
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,920
which is six days from now,

288
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,760
under the pretext of lifting the fishing ban.

289
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,820
What are you doing?

290
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,640
Planning to let over 260 people from Sanzao Island

291
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:38,760
go fishing at sea.

292
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:40,160
Our plan is

293
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,460
to eliminate all these people at sea.

294
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,840
Getting rid of so many at once,

295
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,480
won't that cause public outcry?

296
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:47,520
No.

297
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,420
We've done this several times on the island.

298
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:51,940
This is the last batch.

299
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,320
After eliminating these 260 plus people,

300
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,080
the island will be peaceful.

301
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,600
So,

302
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,520
what do you need me to do?

303
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:02,600
Sasaki.

304
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,320
For our Navy's 6th Air Base,

305
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,180
threats come from three sources.

306
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:14,120
Please take a look.

307
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:15,840
First, those

308
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,080
radical and strong young natives on the island.

309
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,080
Second, the Macau gangsters from District Eight.

310
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:20,840
Over the years,

311
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,680
they've been raiding our island.

312
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,000
More than 40 of the Emperor's soldiers

313
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,460
have died because of this.

314
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,280
Third, those ships after the Humen Naval Battle.

315
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,320
The gunboats of the Chiang regime

316
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,640
that escaped to Macao disguised as merchant ships.

317
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,960
Our plan is to kill three birds with one stone,

318
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,640
solving all these problems at once.

319
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,240
Tell me what you need me to do.

320
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:40,840
Colonel,

321
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,680
in your telegram a few days ago,

322
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:45,400
you mentioned capturing an informant from Anlan Hall.

323
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,160
Yes, there is such a person.

324
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,480
I need

325
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,400
to secretly pass our intelligence to him.

326
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:54,480
The families of Anlan Hall members

327
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:57,000
are still on the island.

328
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,000
If we let them know about our intelligence,

329
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,360
they will definitely come to rescue them.

330
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,920
We'll seize this opportunity to wipe them out in one strike.

331
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,680
This can be arranged.

332
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,600
One more thing,

333
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,280
it would be best

334
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,520
to find a way to let those Chiang regime ships hiding in Macao

335
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,450
receive some information as well.

336
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,480
I can figure something out for this too.

337
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,520
Another thing,

338
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,400
how does Anlan Hall in Macao

339
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,400
communicate with those troublemakers

340
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,520
on the island?

341
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,640
I can work on all of these.

342
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,240
Thank you very much then.

343
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,940
I'll do my best to help you.

344
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,560
Mr. Oshima,

345
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,840
it's getting late.

346
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,860
Let's head back to the hotel early today.

347
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,880
This plan of yours...

348
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,240
I'll study this carefully tonight.

349
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,200
Thank you for your hard work.

350
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,060
We'll discuss the rest tomorrow.

351
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,970
Then I'll take my leave.

352
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,560
Take care.

353
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:00,920
Yamaguchi.

354
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,200
Yes.

355
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,400
Take them back to their hotel.

356
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,170
Thank you for today.

357
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,480
This way, please.

358
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,440
Take care.

359
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,330
Thank you for today.

360
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,400
Please rest early, sir.

361
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,240
I'll come pick you up first thing tomorrow morning.

362
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,160
Thank you for your trouble.

363
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:42,840
Yes.

364
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,290
Oshima Hiroshi.

365
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,520
Great!

366
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:52,970
Where are you going?

367
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,560
Are you sure you didn't make a mistake?

368
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,360
Boss Geng.

369
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,720
Years ago, they massacred people on the island.

370
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,720
I crawled out from a pile of corpses.

371
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:04,960
There's no mistake.

372
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,560
It's definitely Oshima Hiroshi.

373
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,360
My wife and children

374
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,720
all died by his hand.

375
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,450
I'd recognize him even if he were burned to ashes.

376
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,820
How many people came with him?

377
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,720
Two.

378
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,280
One was the driver

379
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,720
who left after dropping them off.

380
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,000
You're sure it was two?

381
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:19,840
Positive.

382
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:25,520
Boss Geng.

383
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,280
I don't want any reward.

384
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,280
I only ask that you kill that monster

385
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,320
to avenge my wife and children,

386
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,680
to avenge all our dead countrymen.

387
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,280
I'm willing to serve you like a beast of burden.

388
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:37,360
Get up.

389
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:40,600
You may leave now.

390
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,880
I'll handle this.

391
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,360
Help me with a few things.

392
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,080
First,

393
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,840
go to the

394
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,320
Lisboa Hotel tonight personally with some men.

395
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,400
You must find out about that Oshima Hiroshi:

396
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,040
how long he's staying,

397
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,840
why he's in Macau,

398
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,080
how he got here,

399
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,460
and when he's leaving.

400
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,040
Second,

401
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,240
send someone tonight to find Haozi.

402
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,520
Tell him to bring his gear

403
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,080
and a few men to see me.

404
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,200
His marksmanship and fighting skills are excellent.

405
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,120
This time

406
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:18,480
it's his chance to show his skills.

407
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:20,120
I'll arrange for people to find him right away.

408
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,120
This time,

409
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:23,640
we can't let those two guys

410
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:25,360
return to the island alive.

411
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,200
Sir,

412
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,600
don't worry.

413
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,120
I'll go arrange it now.

414
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,240
Is doing this

415
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,840
really going to be safe?

416
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:51,840
Not necessarily.

417
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,640
Oshima Hiroshi will soon discover

418
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,560
that Inoue Kamakura might have died first

419
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,490
before being pushed off the cliff.

420
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,040
If that happens,

421
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,520
he'll investigate Inoue Kamakura's

422
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,250
movements throughout the day.

423
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,000
Soon,

424
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,060
the hospital will come into his view.

425
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,720
And when Inoue Kamakura was at the hospital,

426
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,160
we were there too,

427
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,960
creating a point of connection.

428
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,680
So we'll become the prime suspects.

429
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,160
But there's no need to worry too much.

430
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,520
Because someone can testify

431
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,000
that Inoue Kamakura left

432
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:19,960
the hospital on his motorcycle.

433
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,000
If that's the case,

434
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,360
Inoue Kamakura left the hospital alive.

435
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,760
Then the significance of this meeting point

436
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,840
no longer exists.

437
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,010
You're talking about that sentry.

438
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:35,680
What are you looking at?

439
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,210
Hurry up.

440
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,960
The sentry's testimony will be in our favor.

441
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,920
But Oshima Hiroshi might not completely believe it.

442
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:41,960
He will also investigate

443
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,120
everyone who had contact with

444
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,380
Inoue Kamakura today.

445
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,860
Including me and Juer.

446
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,770
Tang Juer is our weak point.

447
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,210
She's honest and timid.

448
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,680
If she panics,

449
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,760
everything will be in trouble.

450
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,690
That's what I'm worried about too.

451
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,200
She's on night shift today.

452
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:03,760
Why don't we go back and have a good talk with her?

453
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:04,690
Absolutely not.

454
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,600
That would just provide evidence for Oshima Hiroshi.

455
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,760
The Major tonight

456
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,920
will handle her.

457
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,760
He is a professional agent.

458
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,560
I believe he will take care of it.

459
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,000
Can I tell my father and brother

460
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,840
about what happened today?

461
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:22,240
Yes,

462
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,570
let them be mentally prepared.

463
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,160
Tomorrow when Juer gets off work,

464
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,720
have your brother bring her over.

465
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,520
We'll talk to her in detail then.

466
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,120
Don't think about it.

467
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,010
So many things happened today,

468
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,800
you should get some rest.

469
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,040
Right here.

470
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,000
You guys keep watch here.

471
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,800
You've seen this person before,

472
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,760
keep your eyes wide open,

473
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,600
no sleeping.

474
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,680
Don't let him get away.

475
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,720
Don't worry,

476
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,980
I won't let him escape.

477
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:25,520
Hello.

478
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,560
Good day, sir.

479
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,960
What service do you need?

480
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,560
My master

481
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,360
has a guest staying here.

482
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,000
I'd like to see

483
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,280
your guest register.

484
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:38,480
Of course.

485
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,160
No problem.

486
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,600
Take your time.

487
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,480
What are you thinking about?

488
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:26,970
A generation of vicissitudes cannot be washed away,

489
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,780
yet the three martyrs of Yaishan still leave their legacy.

490
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:37,560
Are you going to lecture me on 'History of Song' again?

491
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:38,960
Well, well.

492
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,160
It seems lately

493
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:44,020
you've been reading more than just 'Water Margin.'

494
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,840
What you just recited

495
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,040
is the couplet from the Yaishan Three Martyrs Temple hall.

496
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,240
It's recorded in the 'History of Song.'

497
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,290
It's not that I don't like reading such books,

498
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,880
I just think they're useless.

499
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,920
How can they be useless?

500
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,080
History is like a mirror.

501
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:06,880
Reading history makes one wise

502
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:10,040
and helps us learn from the past to predict the future.

503
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:12,640
The future?

504
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,960
But what good is the future?

505
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:16,840
Your reading these books

506
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,520
may make you a civilized person,

507
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,840
but we're living in a barbaric era.

508
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,300
Look at these Japanese on the island.

509
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,720
Can we drive them out

510
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,200
with civilized methods?

511
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,960
In front of savage invaders,

512
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,600
many people only seek self-preservation

513
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,730
and are willing to give up everything.

514
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,840
We've now reached the critical moment

515
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,370
for our nation's survival.

516
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,650
The Japanese have blocked China's passages.

517
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,840
They have almost

518
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:50,720
cut off all channels

519
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,840
for the Chinese government to get foreign aid.

520
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,520
Chiang Kai-shek can only

521
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,400
hold out in the southwest corner.

522
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,760
If this continues,

523
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,520
China will be in danger.

524
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,240
Tell me,

525
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,680
Wu Mu and Ying'er,

526
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,480
are they working for the Kuomintang

527
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,080
or for the Communist Party?

528
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,840
She doesn't want to say,

529
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,090
and I don't want to ask too much.

530
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,600
But honestly speaking,

531
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,320
I do hope

532
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,760
she's working for the Communist Party.

533
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,520
This party

534
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,360
has vigor

535
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,280
and conviction.

536
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:49,380
I don't care about the outside world,

537
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,140
nor can I do anything about it.

538
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,210
I'll just stay with you.

539
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,720
When people die,

540
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,000
they become stars.

541
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,880
Those who miss them,

542
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,560
if they see a star shooting across the sky,

543
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,960
it means someone who misses them

544
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,480
is thinking of them.

545
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,000
Ju'er.

546
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,400
In the sky above our Sanzao Island,

547
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:25,480
not a single star is sad.

548
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,600
When the Japanese leave,

549
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,120
everyone in the country will be free.

550
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,840
We can truly be together,

551
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,960
never to be separated again.

552
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,240
War is an invention of mankind.

553
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,000
Brother.

554
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,640
You're back.

555
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,480
Have you eaten?

556
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,240
Not yet.

557
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:58,250
I'll ask Mrs. Si to prepare something for you.

558
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,920
Major Weite will

559
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,640
replace him at the hospital.

560
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:10,360
Are you alright?

561
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,280
I'm fine.

562
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,679
Jingshang's disappearance

563
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,320
is a serious matter.

564
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:22,199
The Japanese will definitely investigate thoroughly.

565
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:23,679
You need to remind Wumu

566
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:25,040
to be careful

567
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:26,840
and not show any suspicious signs.

568
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,570
To prevent their retaliation.

569
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,840
I understand.

570
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,480
You need to be careful too.

571
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:35,360
Ying'er,

572
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:36,920
is Ju'er alright?

573
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,560
Can I go see her now?

574
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,530
She was frightened,

575
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:41,840
but

576
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,940
it was a close call.

577
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,040
This Jingshang,

578
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:49,679
he was so evil.

579
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,920
He deserved to die.

580
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,960
Please take this to my brother's room.

581
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,000
I'll eat there.

582
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,720
I need to talk to him.

583
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,480
No need.

584
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,080
Just leave it here.

585
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:02,560
Okay.

586
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,520
Don't bother Mrs. Si.

587
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:05,840
You two talk.

588
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,600
Remember what I told you.

589
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,840
Don't forget.

590
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,460
Take care of yourself.

591
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:19,920
I will.

592
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,480
Good night.

593
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,410
Good night, Dad.

594
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,080
Dad, get some rest early.

595
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,600
Ying'er,

596
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:30,760
is

597
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,840
Ju'er still angry with me?

598
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,080
No, she isn't.

599
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,440
She's still worried you don't want her.

600
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,040
Did she ask you

601
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,520
to talk to me?

602
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,640
Is this the first time

603
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,760
in your life that you've felt

604
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,640
so worried about someone?

605
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,040
A little bit, yes.

606
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,920
Before, I only thought about

607
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,960
staying on this island with Dad

608
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,410
and being filial to him.

609
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,840
If someday I could leave this island,

610
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,100
I'd surely make something of myself.

611
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:12,000
On this island, apart from Dad and you,

612
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,240
there wasn't anything

613
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,240
worth missing or caring about.

614
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,080
But now there's another person

615
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,880
I worry about,

616
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,840
and that's Ju'er.

617
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:23,920
Before,

618
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,000
I was always avoiding

619
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:26,640
the feelings between us.

620
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,600
But she kept helping me,

621
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,600
risking her safety again and again.

622
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,560
I don't want

623
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,690
to involve her in my troubles anymore.

624
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,720
But sometimes

625
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,320
when I think about her father,

626
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,920
I feel I should just give up.

627
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,720
But now you see

628
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,120
I feel really troubled.

629
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,720
What?

630
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:58,320
I think you've truly fallen in love with Ju'er.

631
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,050
Not because of the engagement.

632
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,400
Then tell me,

633
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,840
what should I do now?

634
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,840
If I step forward,

635
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:10,170
I'm afraid of putting her in danger again.

636
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,240
But if I step back,

637
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,480
I can't back away anymore.

638
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,400
If I do,

639
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,400
she'll truly think I don't want her.

640
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,840
Stop with those fancy excuses.

641
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,240
All that talk about fearing for her safety.

642
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,080
You just can't swallow your pride

643
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,680
and don't want to apologize.

644
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:27,240
Let me tell you.

645
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,900
Ju'er is much braver than you.

646
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,610
If it weren't for her today,

647
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,840
the consequences

648
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,560
would be unimaginable.

649
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:04,960
Sir.

650
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,360
Master.

651
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,360
Sir,

652
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,240
Rat's associates are all here,

653
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,300
but we can't find Rat himself.

654
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,800
Fulong Street's Xin'an Teahouse.

655
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,640
Have you checked there?

656
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,760
We went there.

657
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,690
He wasn't there.

658
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,800
Send more men

659
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:24,960
to keep searching.

660
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:25,720
Yes, sir.

661
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,120
Go quickly!

662
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,480
Yes, let's go!

663
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,400
What's the situation on your end?

664
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:32,960
Sir,

665
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:35,120
we've gathered all the information.

666
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,960
They indeed only sent two men.

667
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,840
One is Oshima Hiroshi

668
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,120
and the other is Sasaki.

669
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,400
They booked a suite with beds in both rooms.

670
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,360
They plan to leave tomorrow afternoon.

671
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,480
We'll make our move tomorrow.

672
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,530
Don't you dare fall asleep.

673
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,800
Keep your eyes wide open.

674
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,880
Don't let him slip away.

675
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:30,760
Don't worry.

676
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:55,040
Boss.

677
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:56,600
Keep it down.

678
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,240
Where's Master Geng?

679
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,240
Master Geng.

680
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,040
What have you been up to lately?

681
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,570
You're nowhere to be found all day.

682
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,530
I had people looking for you all night yesterday.

683
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,760
Where were you?

684
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,380
I had a few too many drinks last night.

685
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,800
I stayed at the one on Fulong New Street.

686
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,720
At Liangji House.

687
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,360
I've kept you around for this moment.

688
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,280
Now it's time to put you to work.

689
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,400
Can you handle it?

690
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,720
If not, I'll find someone else.

691
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,480
Fine.

692
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,240
Rest assured.

693
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:46,920
Whatever you ask.

694
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,160
When have I ever not handled

695
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,820
your rat problems perfectly?

696
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:54,760
Tell me.

697
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,580
Here's the situation.

698
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,720
One of our enemies

699
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:00,850
has arrived in Macau

700
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:03,480
and is staying at the Lisboa Hotel.

701
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:06,680
Which enemy are we talking about?

702
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:07,160
The boss means...

703
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,320
I figured out last night

704
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,720
their accommodation and travel route.

705
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,680
Their hotel room

706
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,800
is booked until this afternoon.

707
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,600
So...

708
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,760
I expect this afternoon they'll

709
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,240
go to the fishing pier

710
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,320
and leave on a ship owned by Japanese Fuda Company.

711
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,760
The boss wants

712
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:28,100
to make sure these two don't leave alive.

713
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:29,800
What's his name?

714
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,680
His name is Oshima Hiroshi.

715
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,080
He was the head of the Japanese

716
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:37,810
special police unit on our home island of Sanzao.

717
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,320
The massacre a few years ago

718
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,120
and the recent deaths

719
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,680
of the Tiger brothers

720
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,360
were all his doing.

721
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,120
This is our chance.

722
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:49,780
He's delivered himself to us.

723
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,900
I want to use this villain's blood

724
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:55,280
to honor our dead villagers

725
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,880
and our brothers.

726
00:41:59,040 --> 00:41:59,720
Boss Geng.

727
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,360
Where do we make our move?

728
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,560
The hotel has too many people watching.

729
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:05,680
Wait for them on the way.

730
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,800
As soon as they appear,

731
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,280
shoot them dead.

732
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:11,920
Got it.

733
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:13,640
Boss Geng.

734
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,120
I'll take them there.

735
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,770
Success is the only option.

736
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,660
Failure is not permitted.

737
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,220
