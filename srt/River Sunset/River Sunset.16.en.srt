1
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:35,840
What do you mean?

2
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,280
Qingming Festival is coming soon.

3
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,200
No matter how rampant the Japanese are,

4
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,400
they can't stop us from paying respects to our ancestors.

5
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,039
What I mean is,

6
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,880
I'll go with you.

7
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,500
You're always the clever one.

8
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:45,760
Hello.

9
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,079
I'm looking for Captain Oshima.

10
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,240
Okay.

11
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:50,800
Captain.

12
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,440
Captain, sir,

13
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,720
the colonel has gone out by car.

14
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,160
Not sure if he went to see Ye Biying.

15
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,600
Oh, really?

16
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:04,960
Was he alone?

17
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,520
He was the only one in the car.

18
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,720
I see.

19
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,920
Thank you for your hard work.

20
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,330
Thank you very much.

21
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,800
Captain Jingshang.

22
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,290
This disguise fits you quite well.

23
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,360
I'm sorry.

24
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:29,960
What are you doing?

25
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,560
I'm sorry.

26
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,290
I have good news for you.

27
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,440
Really?

28
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,920
Let's report to Captain Daodao right away.

29
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,280
Captain.

30
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,400
Um...

31
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,079
That woman Ye Biying has gone out.

32
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,900
Ye Biying has gone out too.

33
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,240
Not just that woman.

34
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,600
Their whole family has gone out.

35
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,240
Looks like they're going to pay respects to their ancestors.

36
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,520
Should I send someone to follow them?

37
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,120
Which direction did they go?

38
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,520
Did they go northwest?

39
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,320
Northwest.

40
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,700
Northwest direction.

41
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,850
Should we send someone to follow them?

42
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,880
No.

43
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,520
No need to track them.

44
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,760
There's only Caotang Village in the northwest.

45
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,920
Understood?

46
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,560
Yes.

47
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,380
No need to follow them.

48
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,500
That hurts.

49
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,520
I'm sorry.

50
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,120
This outfit really suits you.

51
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,600
Really?

52
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,240
Thank you.

53
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,880
Order the second platoon to assemble.

54
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,340
Search Caotang Mountain.

55
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,840
I understand.

56
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,040
I'll go up and keep watch.

57
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,400
Be careful.

58
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,080
You go in first.

59
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,880
We'll keep watch outside for you.

60
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,320
If anything happens,

61
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,280
I'll break a bowl to signal you.

62
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,400
Don't come out.

63
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:43,840
Hurry up.

64
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:44,600
Go ahead.

65
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,400
Be careful.

66
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,520
Major White,

67
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,080
I'm Ye Biying.

68
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,120
I'm coming in.

69
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,680
Second platoon, assemble!

70
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,340
Prepare for mountain search.

71
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,610
Target: Caotang Mountain.

72
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,680
Ready to move out.

73
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,640
Upon hearing that the police squad

74
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,640
was ordered to search Caotang Village,

75
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,960
Takemura Ichiro knew

76
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,000
that Wei Chen could be exposed at any moment.

77
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,520
He immediately decided to take a risk.

78
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,640
Let's go upstairs to talk.

79
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,200
Yes.

80
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:56,159
This way, please.

81
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,400
Sir.

82
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,120
Colonel Wumu is requesting to see you.

83
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,240
Perfect timing.

84
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,290
Please sit down.

85
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,600
Coming at this hour,

86
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,760
you must have something important.

87
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,200
Nothing too important actually.

88
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,880
My investigation department has been established,

89
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,010
and I came specifically to inform you.

90
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,400
Is this your department for investigating freshwater resources?

91
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,440
Nothing escapes your eye.

92
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,140
The reason I used this name

93
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,880
is to avoid drawing attention and causing panic.

94
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,680
By the way,

95
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:22,600
I'd like to use your radio

96
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,280
to report this matter to Tokyo.

97
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,920
If it's not confidential,

98
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,580
have Deputy Sakamoto send it.

99
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,520
The thing is,

100
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,120
I'm using the Imperial Palace code.

101
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,280
The frequency and call sign are written here.

102
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,280
It goes directly to Tokyo.

103
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,159
After it's sent,

104
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:39,520
I need to take back the message.

105
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,280
I understand.

106
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,040
Give it to me.

107
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,159
Let's chat.

108
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,840
Colonel, do you know much about military classics?

109
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:55,240
A little bit.

110
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,880
This is Miyamoto Musashi's

111
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,560
military treatise, The Book of Five Rings.

112
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,360
And this is the Chinese Art of War by Sun Tzu.

113
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,760
Our martial arts

114
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,800
only teach how to use swords.

115
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,520
Martial arts are

116
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,050
the way of survival for samurai in this world.

117
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,500
They're essentially about swordsmanship.

118
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,600
But China's The Art of War

119
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,600
teaches that the supreme victory

120
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,520
is to win without fighting.

121
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,920
It's about philosophy, strategy, and wisdom.

122
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,880
Conquering such a nation

123
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:28,320
is not actually easy.

124
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,360
The Book of Five Rings

125
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:34,159
and China's The Art of War,

126
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,929
I've read them both before.

127
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,799
The Art of War is a good book,

128
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,240
full of philosophy.

129
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,120
Wumu Yilang was extremely anxious

130
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,840
because he had no time left.

131
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,720
He needed to act before

132
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,160
the police force discovered Weite Chen.

133
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,960
Now he could only hope

134
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,020
the intelligence would be transmitted successfully.

135
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,640
It's sent.

136
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,540
Give me back the original.

137
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,040
A freshwater resource investigation unit has been established.

138
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:23,600
Not bad.

139
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,820
That's your style.

140
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:36,240
The Believer

141
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,320
is about to be exposed.

142
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,720
Request Dongjiang Column to immediately organize effective forces

143
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,720
to attack northern Sanzao Island.

144
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,440
Colonel,

145
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,120
this isn't like you at all.

146
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,120
Emergency call:

147
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,320
Request Dongjiang Column to immediately organize effective forces

148
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,200
to attack northern Sanzao Island and notify Director Shen.

149
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,360
The lumberjack telegraphed to organize effective forces

150
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,890
to attack the northern part of Sanzao Island.

151
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,370
You're from Sanzao Island.

152
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:36,440
Yes.

153
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,640
We've received your telegram.

154
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,000
I want to ask you

155
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,600
how did you establish contact with the island?

156
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,820
It's like this.

157
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,020
There's still a wealthy family on the island

158
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,920
that maintains some connections

159
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,720
with Anlan Hall in Macau's Eighth District.

160
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,050
The telegram sent to you

161
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,840
came through this channel.

162
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,820
Among all those who escaped from the island,

163
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,920
I'm the only one who worked for the government.

164
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,640
When there are government matters,

165
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,000
they often come to me.

166
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,920
What kind of organization

167
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,440
is the Anlan Hall from District Eight?

168
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,200
It's an association formed by

169
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,160
wealthy islanders in Macau.

170
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,360
Who's the leader?

171
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:16,340
The Ye family from Tanjiawan.

172
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,360
The head is

173
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,440
Ye Degong.

174
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,040
Is Anlan Hall his too?

175
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,120
The leader of Anlan Hall is Ye Zhaogeng,

176
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,960
also a relative of the Ye family.

177
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,440
These are two brothers.

178
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,930
Yes, Director Shen.

179
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,120
I understand.

180
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,040
On Sanzao Island,

181
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,440
the only family that has contact with the outside world

182
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:37,520
is the Ye family,

183
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,050
correct?

184
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:38,760
Yes.

185
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,120
The Ye family has a daughter named Ye Biying.

186
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,240
Do you know them?

187
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:46,720
Yes, I do.

188
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,000
Hmm.

189
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,000
Report.

190
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,040
Come in.

191
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:56,840
Director Shen,

192
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,170
Lumberjack is calling.

193
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:00,960
Wu Fazi.

194
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:02,440
Welcome.

195
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,240
Today

196
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,920
you'll be on standby for our orders.

197
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:06,560
Alright.

198
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,280
Please.

199
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,520
Lumberjack is calling,

200
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,080
requesting an immediate artillery attack

201
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,210
on the northern part of Sanzao Island.

202
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,960
Is there an error in your translation?

203
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,090
No error, Director.

204
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:33,360
Wang Jia,

205
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,720
bring Commander Yuan to my office immediately.

206
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,200
One more thing,

207
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,800
tell everyone to pack their bags.

208
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,000
We're going to Macao.

209
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,360
You may go now.

210
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,720
Director Shen.

211
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,240
Something's come up.

212
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:49,960
Commander Yuan,

213
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,320
the situation has changed.

214
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,280
You just mentioned

215
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,440
what's the name of the unit closest to Sanzao Island?

216
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,200
The Second Battalion of the Seventh Detachment.

217
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,260
Communist forces.

218
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,120
This one.

219
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,560
And what about the strait closest to Sanzao Island?

220
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,200
How far is it from the island?

221
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:05,000
About 500 to 600 meters at the closest point.

222
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,280
However,

223
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,640
there are bunker clusters on the opposite shore.

224
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,360
These patrol boats

225
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,760
patrol once every half hour.

226
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,520
The defense is extremely tight.

227
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:15,200
All right.

228
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,690
Notify our people immediately

229
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,880
to launch an attack on the northern shore.

230
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:20,600
Use up all our shells

231
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,040
and ammunition.

232
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,720
Don't conserve anything.

233
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,250
The more noise, the better.

234
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:26,760
After the attack,

235
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,960
I'll make sure headquarters doubles your supplies.

236
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,680
Understood?

237
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,440
The more commotion, the better.

238
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,240
Can you start the battle within half an hour?

239
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,100
Director Shen,

240
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,000
rest assured,

241
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,440
I'll send the message right away.

242
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,300
We'll definitely start firing within half an hour.

243
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,560
Our military's propaganda slogan claims

244
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,080
that before the war with China,

245
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,960
for over 300 years,

246
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:46,560
Japan had never lost

247
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,800
a foreign war.

248
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:49,880
Those people in the military headquarters

249
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,210
are all ignorant fools.

250
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,420
Our Japan is a typical island nation,

251
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:56,360
narrow from north to south,

252
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,020
and shallow from east to west.

253
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,680
Resources are scarce,

254
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,250
and arable land is limited.

255
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,640
The total area is only 370,000 square kilometers,

256
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,440
one twenty-fifth of America's territory,

257
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,560
and one twenty-seventh of China's.

258
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,240
Bordered by the Pacific Ocean to the east,

259
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,970
and the Sea of Japan to the west.

260
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:15,160
If one day the war reaches our homeland,

261
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,600
it could easily be divided by enemies.

262
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,000
That would be dangerous.

263
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:24,460
His Majesty the Emperor shares these concerns.

264
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,720
As long as we're fighting abroad,

265
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,040
it means the territory of our Great Japanese Empire

266
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,160
remains safe.

267
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:34,400
If one day we have to fight on our own soil,

268
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,410
then the Great Japanese Empire will be in danger.

269
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,080
So General, you mean

270
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:43,760
this is the only way

271
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,700
to avoid danger, correct?

272
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,400
More than 80 years ago,

273
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,730
Yoshida Shoin proposed

274
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,760
taking Korea,

275
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,560
seizing Manchuria,

276
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,600
suppressing China,

277
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,280
approaching India,

278
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:54,960
to expand our territory,

279
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,160
and establish a defensive foundation.

280
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,120
Not losing a war for over 300 years

281
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,920
is what our ancestors taught us:

282
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,440
Japan can only fight on external lines.

283
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,690
I remember more than 100 years ago,

284
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,960
our pioneer,

285
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:11,560
Sato Nobuyuki said something similar.

286
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:12,880
He said,

287
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,440
'The world should be our prefecture and all foreign kings our servants.'

288
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,560
He advocated that we should

289
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:21,360
sweep through northern China and make Nanjing our imperial palace.

290
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,320
The Major seems quite knowledgeable about history.

291
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,050
What we're doing here is merely

292
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:30,810
fulfilling the wishes of our ancestors from over a century ago.

293
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,000
Colonel,

294
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:37,840
here's your manuscript.

295
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,760
Good. Thank you.

296
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,560
General,

297
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,960
I'll take my leave now.

298
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,970
It was a pleasure talking with you.

299
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,610
Won't you stay a bit longer?

300
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,680
I need to pick up Miss Ye.

301
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:58,240
There's no stopping young people in these matters.

302
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,480
It's nice to have family around.

303
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:08,880
Actually,

304
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,860
I just reunited with my family recently too.

305
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,730
If it weren't for this mission,

306
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,720
I wouldn't have come back to Sanzao Island.

307
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,160
So I can understand how you feel.

308
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:24,810
Take it easy.

309
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:28,530
Your wound is hurting again, isn't it?

310
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,620
I really don't know

311
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,780
how you've managed to survive all this time.

312
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,520
Don't worry.

313
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,560
Wumu will definitely find a way

314
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,160
to help you escape from here.

315
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,520
What's this?

316
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,819
A wedding ring.

317
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,440
You're married?

318
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,880
For two years now.

319
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:25,440
Do you know

320
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:27,839
where I

321
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:28,840
proposed to her?

322
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,660
At the entrance to her family's kitchen.

323
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,280
When we got married,

324
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,180
we were both drunk.

325
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,280
We have a child too.

326
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,240
I wasn't there when she was born.

327
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,360
They told me before I got on the plane

328
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,760
that it was a girl.

329
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,360
But I'm sorry,

330
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,530
I don't have any photos.

331
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,600
Otherwise,

332
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,240
I could show you what she looks like.

333
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,400
But it's okay.

334
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,320
She must be beautiful.

335
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
She probably looks like her mother.

336
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,200
Actually, the reason you asked me to come today

337
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:29,000
is because you want me to help you escape from here, right?

338
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:31,680
Yes.

339
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,360
In my current condition,

340
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,570
I can't leave by myself.

341
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,200
I need your help.

342
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,200
You know,

343
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,080
when you told me

344
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,770
I could be smuggled out,

345
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,300
I really thought I was going to see my daughter soon.

346
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,320
I desperately need to get out of this hellhole.

347
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,280
Although I don't know what mission you're carrying out

348
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,210
or what your assignment really is,

349
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,320
but I do know

350
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,240
that every daughter

351
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,240
must want to see her father.

352
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:25,120
Longxia.

353
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,000
What's wrong?

354
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,400
The Japanese are here.

355
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,660
The Japanese are here.

356
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,680
How did they find out so quickly?

357
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,650
Something's happened.

358
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,640
Let's go upstairs

359
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,440
and distract them.

360
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,120
Okay.

361
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,290
Set it up.

362
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,040
Si Po.

363
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,170
Arrange the dishes.

364
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:27,600
What a coincidence,

365
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,440
Mr. Ye,

366
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,160
running into you here.

367
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,850
What a coincidence,

368
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,040
meeting you people everywhere.

369
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,680
Today I

370
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,540
brought my family to pay respects to our ancestors.

371
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,520
If you need to conduct military drills,

372
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,240
please do it somewhere else.

373
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:45,300
Show respect for the deceased

374
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,650
and don't disturb them.

375
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,640
Thank you.

376
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,330
Where is Miss Ye?

377
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,200
Where's Miss Ye?

378
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,000
We...

379
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,760
Father.

380
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:15,800
You're back.

381
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:16,280
Look,

382
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,170
great-grandfather's favorite yellow flowers.

383
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,160
Put them there.

384
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,760
You go that way. The rest, follow me.

385
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,800
Yes, sir.

386
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:49,840
How come there's not a single trace?

387
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,000
Search further ahead. The visibility here is too poor.

388
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,000
Look carefully.

389
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,700
It must be somewhere around here.

390
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,640
Let's check over there.

391
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,280
Copy that.

392
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:33,840
Sir!

393
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,080
We have an emergency!

394
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,140
What's happening?

395
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,360
The northern section of the base is under attack.

396
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,680
A small guerrilla force

397
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,320
dares to attack our base.

398
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,560
Have they gone mad?

399
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,440
The gunfire is extremely heavy.

400
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,360
They're going all out.

401
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,800
What are you panicking for?

402
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,840
Sound the battle alarm.

403
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,320
Order the garrison battalion to get there.

404
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:52,320
The patrol boat squadron must deploy immediately for support.

405
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,000
Also,

406
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:54,840
order the air squadron to launch bombers,

407
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,200
identify the attack positions,

408
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,400
and commence air strikes immediately.

409
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,120
Go now!

410
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,640
Fall in!

411
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:08,240
Hurry up!

412
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:12,000
Move it!

413
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,490
What's going on?

414
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:42,800
Those gunshots

415
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:46,060
seem to be coming from the north side of the base.

416
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,200
It's possible that

417
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,000
they found that American there.

418
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,120
I see.

419
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,640
Let's go check it out.

420
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,690
Let's move! Let's move!

421
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,760
Wumu knew

422
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,880
this attack

423
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,240
could only ease the immediate danger.

424
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:20,760
Caotang Village was already on Oshima Hiroshi's radar.

425
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,960
He had to relocate Major White as soon as possible.

426
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,720
These people are getting bolder

427
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,000
in broad daylight.

428
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,560
Do they really dare to attack the base?

429
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,400
Yes,

430
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,520
this has never happened before.

431
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,970
Even the air squadron has been mobilized.

432
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,040
Chongqing 08596 Biying.

433
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,890
Chongqing 08596 Ye Biying.

434
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,400
Biying.

435
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,560
Wumu.

436
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,600
Mr. Ye, is Biying here?

437
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,440
Come in.

438
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,960
I just accompanied Ying'er to the cave

439
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,760
to change the Major's bandages.

440
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,760
Our family pretended to be paying respects to ancestors

441
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,280
to provide cover for her.

442
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,600
But soon after,

443
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,200
the Japanese came to search the mountain.

444
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,880
They were about to discover the cave entrance

445
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,600
when fortunately we heard cannon fire.

446
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,440
Otherwise,

447
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,400
the consequences would have been unimaginable.

448
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,280
It might be because of your ancestral worship on the mountain

449
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,920
that drew the attention of the police squad

450
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,120
to Caotang Mountain.

451
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,200
Too many people.

452
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,320
It was my oversight.

453
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,520
Where did that cannon fire come from?

454
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,080
How could it be such a coincidence?

455
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:32,800
Indeed.

456
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:33,760
It was assisted by the Military Statistics Bureau

457
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,420
in a diversionary operation.

458
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,240
You just said Biying went to change the Major's bandages,

459
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,000
but didn't she just do that not long ago?

460
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,600
She said she had an appointment with the Major.

461
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,820
Where is the Major now?

462
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,840
Where is Biying?

463
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,840
Tonight's smuggling meeting point is at Jinwan Beach.

464
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,280
Ying'er is taking care of the Major in the cave.

465
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,720
She should be back soon.

466
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,040
I understand.

467
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:54,840
Mr. Ye,

468
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,400
I'll go bring Biying back first.

469
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,040
All right.

470
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,860
Be careful on your way.

471
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,160
The sound is gone.

472
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,720
Has the gunfire stopped?

473
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,400
Seems so.

474
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:31,600
Get in the car.

475
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,440
Why are you here?

476
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,040
How long were you planning to hide this from me?

477
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,400
Where are you taking me?

478
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,640
Stop the car.

479
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,890
I said stop the car. Did you hear me?

480
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,840
Stop!

481
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,200
If you don't want him to die,

482
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:20,920
you'd better tell me right now

483
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,720
where he is.

484
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:23,320
Who's trying to kill him?

485
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,100
What are you doing?

486
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,570
Someone is watching us.

487
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:31,600
Don't move.

488
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:34,120
Don't you know the police unit

489
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,920
has been watching you all along?

490
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,000
How is that possible?

491
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,960
You had just arrived at Caotang Mountain

492
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,080
when they came searching right after you.

493
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,000
If the Military Intelligence hadn't

494
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,680
created a diversion with a raid,

495
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,720
you and Weite would be

496
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,400
in the police interrogation room

497
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,460
being questioned by Oshima Hiroshi.

498
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,560
You would also implicate your father,

499
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,640
your brother,

500
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:57,840
Sipo,

501
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,880
and even the entire village.

502
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,840
I won't let that happen.

503
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,400
What makes you say that?

504
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,680
What power do you have to prevent it?

505
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,880
Think about it.

506
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,720
They'll assign one person to watch you,

507
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,960
then a second one,

508
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,000
and a third.

509
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,650
Without my protection,

510
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,260
your recklessness

511
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:24,400
will sooner or later

512
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,560
put them in danger.

513
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,610
Is that what you want to see?

514
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,160
I promise you,

515
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,320
after I meet Weite,

516
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,880
as long as it doesn't affect the bigger picture,

517
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,340
I will respect his wishes.

518
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,640
Tell me where he is.

519
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,440
It's just ahead.

520
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,200
Wait.

521
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:39,920
Over there.

522
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,720
Major,

523
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,720
it's me.

524
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,960
Major White.

525
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,480
Are you sure you hid him here?

526
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:01,960
Yes, I'm sure.

527
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,560
That's strange.

528
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,080
Stop looking.

529
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,810
He knew you would bring me here,

530
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,200
so he hid himself.

531
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,440
What do we do now?

532
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,980
I hope before the smuggling time,

533
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,800
he won't be discovered by the Japanese.

534
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,240
Wait.

535
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,400
Are you saying you agree

536
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,660
to the smuggling plan?

537
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,720
Do I have a choice?

538
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,000
Where are you going?

539
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,400
There used to be defensive fortifications here.

540
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,040
As the war in Southeast Asia expanded,

541
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,440
they were all relocated.

542
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,960
Now only barbed wire remains,

543
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,240
and empty bunkers.

544
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,320
What are you doing?

545
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,960
It says 'landmines' there!

546
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:11,300
Don't go there!

547
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,560
Wait for me here.

548
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:14,800
Don't move.

549
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:15,960
Wumu!

550
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:18,880
Wumu!

[Sakura Maru]

554
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,120
The patrol boat indeed

555
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,650
comes once every half hour.

556
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:50,240
When we cross over tonight,

557
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,170
this information will be crucial.

558
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,240
Ye Biying.

559
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,220
While we still have some time,

560
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,540
we need to make preparations.

561
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,930
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

[Salute]

563
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,040
The flying lighter

564
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,840
refers to this type of aircraft, right?

565
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,840
Yes.

566
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:48,600
I mean,

567
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,440
on February 5 last year,

568
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,239
was General Okaku Mineo who crashed

569
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:54,159
also flying this type of aircraft?

570
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,620
Reporting, Colonel, sir.

571
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,360
The navy generals

572
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,560
all prefer to use this type of aircraft.

573
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:03,240
Admiral Yamamoto Isoroku chose it.

574
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,800
General Osumi was flying

575
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,520
this Type I land-based attack aircraft

576
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,720
at that time.

577
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,760
I've heard that this aircraft

578
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,820
doesn't have good armor protection.

579
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,080
Yes, Colonel.

580
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,200
When this aircraft was manufactured,

581
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:18,960
it wasn't equipped with

582
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,360
armor plating or self-sealing fuel tanks.

583
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,000
That's why they were shot down in large numbers.

584
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,280
Extremely unlucky.

585
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,560
I see.

586
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:30,520
Mitsubishi Corporation

587
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,360
still hasn't

588
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:33,620
made any improvements to this aircraft.

589
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,360
I need this aircraft's fuel line

590
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,740
to take back and examine thoroughly.

591
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:46,080
I'm currently investigating an accident.

592
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,440
According to the pilot,

593
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,720
ice formation in the fuel lines causes

594
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,680
one of the engine's heat exchangers

595
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,760
to lose power.

596
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,080
Is that true?

597
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:57,160
In the cold regions of Hokkaido,

598
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,820
this risk definitely exists.

599
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,080
Even now the manufacturing company

600
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,760
is unable to effectively

601
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,520
solve this problem.

602
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,360
It's truly difficult to prevent

603
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,160
water vapor in fuel from freezing in cold regions.

604
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,040
But this is a southern subtropical region,

605
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:18,200
so this risk absolutely shouldn't exist.

606
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,360
How do you know the temperature up there

607
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:22,920
won't drop below freezing?

608
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:36,200
This special agent is very professional.

609
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,440
Is that all?

610
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,000
That's all.

611
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,620
According to what you're saying,

612
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,400
it really was just one time.

613
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,930
An attack with no clear strategic objective?

614
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,880
Yes.

615
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:13,810
We suffered no casualties either.

616
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,600
Our enemy fired all their weapons

617
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,360
just to make me

618
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,760
hear some noise?

619
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:26,920
Oshima.

620
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,240
Yes?

621
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:29,640
What do you think?

622
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:32,200
This attack is very suspicious.

623
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,680
We need time

624
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,880
to determine the purpose of the attack.

625
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,440
The base has been established for over four years,

626
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,640
and this is the first time something so strange has happened.

627
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,200
You must investigate thoroughly

628
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,960
and give me a reasonable explanation.

629
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,880
Yes, sir.

630
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,440
Order the base guards to maintain patrol duty.

631
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:53,280
Proceed according to the combat plan.

632
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:05,680
What about the Caotang Mountain area?

633
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,080
Did we leave staff on duty?

634
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,640
We left twenty people there

635
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,720
and set up ten sentry posts.

636
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:11,520
At dawn tomorrow,

637
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,050
we'll continue the search.

638
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,200
Let's hope this person

639
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,800
is still within our control.

640
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:18,760
What's the situation with the Ye family?

641
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:19,760
They were at the ancestral ceremony,

642
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,240
but rushed back when they heard gunfire.

643
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:24,820
They've returned.

644
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,600
We didn't see Ye Biying at first,

645
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,920
but our surveillance later reported

646
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,320
she went to the beach with the Major.

647
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,560
What are they doing at the beach?

648
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,160
I suppose even the Major occasionally needs

649
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,040
to be romantic with his lover.

650
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:39,920
Is that so?

651
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,320
Sasaki,

652
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,320
call the patrol boat unit for me.

653
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,120
Things aren't peaceful lately.

654
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,840
If the Americans can't find him,

655
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,530
he still can't stay on the island forever.

656
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:53,680
Ask the patrol boat unit to increase patrols

657
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:54,880
to once every twenty minutes.

658
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:55,800
Understood?

659
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,880
Understood.

660
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:16,920
Biying.

661
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,320
It's about time.

662
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,000
Mr. Wumu.

663
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,480
We still have some time.

664
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,010
Come have something to eat.

665
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,250
I need to talk to you.

666
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:30,640
Mrs. Si.

667
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,480
Please bring another set of dishes.

668
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,680
I'll get a chair.

669
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:44,580
Have a seat.

670
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:45,760
Thank you.

671
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:52,610
Go ahead and eat.

672
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:54,640
Mr. Ye.

673
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,080
This is the first time

674
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,130
I've eaten in a Chinese home since I can remember.

675
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,040
Come on, let's eat.

676
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:04,880
Eat up.

677
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:05,720
Thank you.

678
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,810
Have some bread.

679
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:10,600
Here.

680
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,400
Thanks.

681
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,520
Our home hasn't been

682
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,050
this lively for a long time.

683
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,450
With you here today,

684
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:29,440
it's much more cheerful.

685
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,640
So I'd like to

686
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:32,840
take this opportunity

687
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:34,080
thank you.

688
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:36,600
When Ying'er

689
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,880
gets to Macau,

690
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,090
please take care of her.

691
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:43,320
Mr. Ye.

692
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:45,240
This is all part of my duty.

693
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,610
Please don't worry.

694
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,770
All of you can rest assured.

695
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,040
What else?

696
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,320
Tonight,

697
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:53,960
I want

698
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,560
Xia'er to leave with you all.

699
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,600
We've discussed this more than once.

700
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:00,080
As long as you're here,

701
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:01,410
I'm not going anywhere.

702
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:02,560
Why stay with me

703
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,440
on this island?

704
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:06,440
What's the point of keeping an old man like me company?

705
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,000
You're still so young.

706
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,440
Staying here with me will only hold you back.

707
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,800
Leave while you still can.

708
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,680
Just go.

709
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:13,920
Don't wait until it's too late.

710
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,120
You can't escape now.

711
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,920
Please stop trying to persuade me.

712
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,850
I'm not leaving.

713
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,120
Don't worry.

714
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,320
Once I get to Macau

715
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,320
and deliver Major White there,

716
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,920
I'll come back to be with you.

717
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,240
Don't ever come back to this island.

718
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:31,760
After you reach Macau,

719
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,560
I hope you'll

720
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,920
continue on to America

721
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,120
to find your brother.

722
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,200
No.

723
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,340
I will come back to be with you.

724
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,320
Wumu.

725
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:47,040
You're well aware of the situation out there.

726
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,200
After it's done,

727
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:51,410
can you keep her under control?

728
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,330
She will obey my orders.

729
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:54,680
Don't worry.

730
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,280
Good.

731
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:57,160
Good.

732
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:00,960
Ying'er.

733
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,960
When you get to Macau,

734
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,060
give my regards to your uncle.

735
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,800
Listen to his advice

736
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,240
on how to enter the mainland from Macau.

737
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,000
I understand.

738
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,080
Come, eat.

739
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:19,400
Long Xia.

740
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,120
After I leave,

741
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:22,840
there's one more thing

742
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,040
I need your help with.

743
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:25,800
Sure.

744
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:26,760
What is it?

745
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,730
Let's talk after we finish eating.

746
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,220
