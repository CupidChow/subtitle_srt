1
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:44,759
Come in.

2
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:55,160
Captain.

3
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,600
Rest early.

4
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,479
Where is Colonel now?

5
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,400
He went back to the barracks with Ye Biying.

6
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,200
What about the hospital?

7
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,120
Akinowa's high-shot squadron

8
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,400
He's still in the hospital.

9
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,520
The people we sent

10
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,680
can only stay outside the hospital.

11
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,840
As long as he's still in the hospital,

12
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,520
we still have a chance.

13
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,000
Send two more people there.

14
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,840
Keep an eye on the hospital.

15
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,200
This is a critical period.

16
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,320
They report as soon as they hear anything.

17
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,200
Okay.

18
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,400
Captain.

19
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:27,160
Rest early.

20
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,920
Takemici.

21
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,320
If fishing on the sea

22
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:57,960
is a big slaughter,

23
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,800
Will you choose

24
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,760
to save more than 260 villagers?

25
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,320
I'm a warrior of the Eight Army.

26
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,080
I can't let this plan succeed.

27
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,080
I must stay.

28
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:18,120
We'll part tomorrow.

29
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,720
Take care.

30
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:40,920
What's wrong?

31
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,600
Breakfast is here.

32
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,800
Eat something before you go.

33
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,240
Okay. Put it on the table.

34
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,320
Are you still worried about the sea ban?

35
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,520
I promise.

36
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,000
Once I get the Major out safely,

37
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,520
I'll go back to Sambu Island.

38
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,960
to find out the truth.

39
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,880
Don't come back.

40
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,960
You should go to Tokyo

41
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,280
and get your mother out.

42
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,520
I'll do both.

43
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,360
But our priority now

44
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,600
is to send the Major out safely.

45
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,880
I understand.

46
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:25,840
Bye.

47
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,840
I want to

48
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,760
my mother's grave first.

49
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,360
We're running out of time.

50
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,640
It won't take long.

51
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,520
See you at the airport.

52
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,560
I'll drive you there.

53
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,120
No need.

54
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,360
I'll take a shortcut.

55
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,800
It's not attractive.

56
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,800
Be careful.

57
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,080
See you at the airport.

58
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,040
Dr. Jin.

59
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,400
I need to transfer a patient here

60
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,840
to the hospital in Shanghai.

61
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,040
You need to sign here.

62
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,120
Okay.

63
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:45,880
Thank you.

64
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,200
Nurse Tang.

65
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,800
Thank you.

66
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,160
Take care.

67
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,800
Time to go.

68
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,640
Thank you for your hard work.

69
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,080
Go back and report to Captain Akino.

70
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,160
You may leave now.

71
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:22,680
Yes.

72
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,520
Colonel,

73
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,480
Everything is ready.

74
00:06:58,480 --> 00:06:59,760
We can take off anytime.

75
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,200
Always ready.

76
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:01,920
Yes.

77
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,520
Why hasn't Miss Ye come yet?

78
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,280
Just wait.

79
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,280
Sir.

80
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:14,760
Captain.

81
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,640
Colonel Takemuki is on the move.

82
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,200
What?

83
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:18,520
Just now.

84
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,520
Colonel Takemuki, drive.

85
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,320
took the injured private

86
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,640
to the hospital.

87
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,280
Stop that private.

88
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,040
Something's wrong with him.

89
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,200
Takemici.

90
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,200
I've decided to stay.

91
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:12,640
The lifting of the sea ban may be a massacre.

92
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,120
I must stop this conspiracy.

93
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,400
Don't come back.

94
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,000
Take care.

95
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,159
What's wrong?

96
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,320
Did something happen to her?

97
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,240
Get on the plane and wait for me.

98
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,240
I'll be right back.

99
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:03,720
08596.

100
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,000
Take off now.

101
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,960
Get on the plane.

102
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,360
Take off quickly.

103
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,520
Go after them!

104
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,640
Speed up!

105
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:38,720
Come on!

106
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,080
Go after him!

107
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:42,320
Can't you go faster?

108
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,520
Enlarge the gas.

109
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,320
Bigger.

110
00:09:59,160 --> 00:09:59,760
Hurry up.

111
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,560
Can't you drive faster?

112
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,240
Come on.

113
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,200
Go faster.

114
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:13,680
Speed up.

115
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,720
Go!

116
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,160
Faster!

117
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,160
Don’t let them fly.

118
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:40,720
Colonel!

119
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,920
Stop him!

120
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,200
Pull him up.

121
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,360
Hurry!

122
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,040
Takemici.

123
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,120
Major.

124
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,720
I wish you a safe trip.

125
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,240
All the best.

126
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,000
Miss Ye missed the flight.

127
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,760
I’m sorry.

128
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,560
Commander.

129
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,200
Colonel has left this island.

130
00:12:58,200 --> 00:12:59,560
Why is he in such a hurry?

131
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,480
Why didn't I know about this?

132
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,040
and took a suspicious person.

133
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:03,800
Watch your attitude.

134
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,000
What are you doing here?

135
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,640
You don’t need to report everything

136
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,080
to you.

137
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,560
Please figure out

138
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,000
your position and title.

139
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,400
Sakamoto.

140
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,840
Take everyone out.

141
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,760
I have something to say to him.

142
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,720
Excuse me.

143
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,760
Colonel came to Samsan

144
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,600
to come to Sanbu Island

145
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,000
to conduct a secret investigation.

146
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,640
Now the investigation

147
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:42,480
has made a breakthrough.

148
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,520
He's leaving?

149
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:44,800
There's no need to make it public.

150
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,040
Breakthrough progress.

151
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,400
Do you mean that private?

152
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:49,520
About this,

153
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,680
get involved in this.

154
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,080
This is about

155
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,960
between the higher-ups

156
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,000
and the fight between the higher-ups.

157
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:58,120
Colonel got some important information

158
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,280
from this witness.

159
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,920
to send him to the garrison in Shanghai.

160
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,840
He should be here in two and a half hours.

161
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,920
Witness.

162
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,120
You mean that loser

163
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:12,640
by the villagers?

164
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,600
He has nothing to do

165
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:15,840
with Daikokuro Kiyoshi?

166
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,800
This witness proved

167
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,240
the mastermind

168
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,240
is among us.

169
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,560
His testimony

170
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,480
can change someone's fate on the island.

171
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,200
and even affect

172
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,680
the layout of Air 6.

173
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,400
You know?

174
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,480
Colonel has left.

175
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,800
Just do your job.

176
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,240
I see.

177
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:42,960
I'll take my leave.

178
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,520
This person did prove

179
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,320
the mastermind

180
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,480
is among us.

181
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,480
His testimony

182
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,200
can change someone's fate on the island.

183
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:03,960
and even affect

184
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,280
the layout of Air 6.

185
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,120
You know?

186
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,280
Colonel has left.

187
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,640
Just do your job.

188
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:17,960
Let's go to the base hospital.

189
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:22,040
The suspect has been taken away by the colonel.

190
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,280
Go to that ward.

191
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,000
Ward?

192
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,960
Don't forget.

193
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,120
we've found out that there is

194
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,480
is very suspicious.

195
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,240
But Colonel didn’t let us in before.

196
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,080
Now he's gone.

197
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,160
Let's go in and search.

198
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,800
When did the patient leave?

199
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,920
This morning.

200
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,800
Did anyone come in after that?

201
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:10,240
Did you touch anything in this room?

202
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,840
No.

203
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,960
The nurse is changing shift.

204
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,480
I didn’t have time to clean.

205
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:21,880
Captain.

206
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:26,480
It's no different from the general ward.

207
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,600
Except

208
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,720
that the patient needs,

209
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:33,240
nothing suspicious was found.

210
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,640
Captain.

211
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,760
What is this medicine for?

212
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,840
This is penicillin for injection.

213
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,280
Anti-inflammation and cure infection.

214
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,960
You use this medicine frequently.

215
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,800
Done.

216
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,640
Take all these

217
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,560
as evidence.

218
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:07,760
Yes.

219
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:22,000
Wait.

220
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,680
What is this medicine for?

221
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,040
This is for vocal cords.

222
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,680
Why didn't Colonel bring this medicine?

223
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,480
Did he forget?

224
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:12,840
No.

225
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,080
His vocal cords are fine.

226
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,400
He doesn't need this medicine at all.

227
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:25,000
I'm afraid he's not that private.

228
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,160
Right.

229
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,680
Where is Tang Ju?

230
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,400
Take her back and lock her up.

231
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,880
She must know some key information.

232
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,760
Hurry up.

233
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,800
Take her to the interrogation room.

234
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:57,600
Yes.

235
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:07,760
Captain.

236
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,120
Do we need to

237
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,720
keep an eye on the hospital?

238
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,760
He's gone.

239
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,320
What are you monitoring?

240
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:17,680
What if that woman named Ye comes again?

241
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:18,920
That woman

242
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,800
got on the plane together?

243
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,240
No.

244
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,160
Colonel left the hospital

245
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,600
with the second-class soldier.

246
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,360
and went straight to the airport.

247
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,680
Ye Biying didn't show up.

248
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,320
I haven't seen her.

249
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,760
This is interesting.

250
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,480
Why didn't Colonel

251
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,240
his beloved female assistant?

252
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,600
Interesting.

253
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,560
Stop monitoring the hospital.

254
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,960
Take two more people

255
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,480
to keep an eye on the Ye family.

256
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,800
And Miss Ye.

257
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,000
Report to me if anything happens.

258
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,680
Got it.

259
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,160
Where are we going next?

260
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,520
Back to the team.

261
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:06,920
Take the medicine back.

262
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,480
Yes.

263
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,480
What are you doing?

264
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,320
What are you looking at?

265
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,040
What's on it?

266
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,000
Your brother is up there.

267
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:32,920
What?

268
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,400
Third,

269
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,840
Remember.

270
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,320
There are thousands of ways for a dancer

271
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,720
to reject her guests.

272
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,880
It's the worst

273
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,040
is the worst.

274
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,360
If you do this tonight,

275
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,520
we're done for.

276
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,360
What is this?

277
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,480
Who are you to enter my room?

278
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,360
We know each other.

279
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,200
You said it.

280
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,160
What the fisherman thinks of

281
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,800
is their current life.

282
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,480
they would never expect

283
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,320
that

284
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,960
life will be in danger.

285
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,160
So,

286
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,880
when you talk to them,

287
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,480
don't beat around the bush.

288
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,480
Just cut to the chase.

289
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,560
and tell them

290
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,080
to them.

291
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,720
What else?

292
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,400
I'm talking to you.

293
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,360
Where are you looking?

294
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,000
Cigarettes.

295
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,720
Buns for sale.

296
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,800
It seems that

297
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,800
This mission

298
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,560
can only be successful.

299
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,960
If he didn't come back in time,

300
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,640
he would have been in charge.

301
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,880
Who is he?

302
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:46,640
It's a secret.

303
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,880
You didn’t mention anything.

304
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,720
I hope everything goes well.

305
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,480
We're friends.

306
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,360
It's them.

307
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,800
Whose car did they get in?

308
00:24:58,920 --> 00:24:59,720
Follow them.

309
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:11,880
There's a car behind us.

310
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,000
It’s the commander.

311
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,400
Our men should have done it.

312
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,320
As planned,

313
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,080
our people will start creating

314
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:55,800
a car accident.

315
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,560
and take him back.

316
00:25:59,160 --> 00:25:59,600
Boss.

317
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,360
Can we move now?

318
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:03,240
Do it.

319
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:13,720
Wait.

320
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,680
Shanghai deployment army.

321
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,600
Why are the Japanese here?

322
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,800
Akashisawa.

323
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,880
If the situation is tricky later,

324
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,840
you can leave first.

325
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,760
Don’t expose yourself.

326
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,320
Sorry to bother you, Colonel.

327
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,200
I’m the deputy commander

328
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,600
Adjutant of Tangchuan Anfu.

329
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,760
Shoichi Kimura.

330
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,560
Excuse me, Colonel.

331
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,520
I’m ordered by the Chief.

332
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,480
OK.

333
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,240
I'm here to escort you

334
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,600
and your important witness.

335
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,760
to the command center.

336
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,680
Thank you, General.

337
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,920
But I want to keep a low profile in this operation.

338
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,720
It's the opposite

339
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,120
It’s the opposite.

340
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,400
Don't worry, Colonel.

341
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,680
These soldiers are all leaders.

342
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,400
selected right-hand men.

343
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,520
Absolutely.

344
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,640
guarantee your safety.

345
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,280
How about this?

346
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,000
Let's split up.

347
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,080
You'll attract attention.

348
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,800
We'll meet at the command center.

349
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,240
Sorry, sir.

350
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,600
I promised the Chief

351
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,960
to escort him personally.

352
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,480
You go first.

353
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,480
I'll take the general's car.

354
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,240
The Chief has given special care

355
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,080
that your attendant

356
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,360
is an important witness.

357
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,920
There must be no mistake.

358
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,400
This is an important witness

359
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,160
an important witness.

360
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:27,040
So he must never leave me.

361
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,960
Okay.

362
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:45,800
Let's go.

363
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:54,960
Boss.

364
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:56,280
What should we do?

365
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,080
The Japanese intercepted it.

366
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,120
Keep following.

367
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,280
Habha!

368
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,400
Captain Oshima.

369
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:31,480
Will he do something to Colonel Takemichi?

370
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,040
I've told him everything.

371
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:40,520
Do you think he will

372
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,960
and do nothing?

373
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,600
Get off.

374
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,400
Get off.

375
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,480
Call our men.

376
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:45,520
My vegetables.

377
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,120
My vegetable!

378
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,640
A car hit me!

379
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:50,640
Get down.

380
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,760
What are you doing?

381
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,480
You broke my vegetable.

382
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,160
Don't block the way.

383
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,000
Get out of here.

384
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:55,840
Come down.

385
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,600
Go!

386
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,880
Leave.

387
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,680
Three, four.

388
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:03,760
One, two, three, four.

389
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,200
Captain.

390
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,240
Aren't you worried?

391
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:05,920
Worried about what?

392
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,920
He left such an important task

393
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,080
this important task.

394
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,480
Will it work?

395
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,360
No problem. The Shanghai garrison will help us.

396
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,040
You hit me!

397
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,080
I'll go down and have a look.

398
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:16,760
Okay.

399
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,360
Leave now.

400
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,200
Take her away.

401
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:24,880
Pay up!

402
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:25,640
Don't let them off!

403
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:25,960
Leave!

404
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:26,920
Don't let them go.

405
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,800
Leave.

406
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:28,920
They are not vegetable vendors.

407
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,800
They are targeting them.

408
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,520
It's them.

409
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,800
Help!

410
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,000
Kill that witness.

411
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:00,560
Protect those two.

412
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,320
Protect them to retreat.

413
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,880
Cover!

414
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,040
Retreat!

415
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,080
We need to contact

416
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:17,680
with your government.

417
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,160
The fire is too strong.

418
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,200
We can't make it.

419
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,480
Even if you communicate now,

420
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:24,720
you can't get away.

421
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,520
We'll end up in the enemy's hands.

422
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:52,880
Where is Colonel?

423
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:53,600
I don't know.

424
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,200
Get lost!

425
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:15,840
Colonel.

426
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,640
Don't get me wrong, Colonel.

427
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,120
We are Mr. Irigami.

428
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,400
to protect Colonel.

429
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,120
to send you away.

430
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,200
Let's go.

431
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:41,680
Go.

432
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,040
Sir,

433
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:45,960
We've surrounded this place.

434
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,400
Get rid of the witness.

435
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,280
Lieutenant.

436
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,120
We're from Banzai Club.

437
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,480
Join the battle.

438
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:55,000
to ensure your safety.

439
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,280
Get the witness.

440
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,080
Yes.

441
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,200
If it were you,

442
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,640
I heard the suspect who killed your son

443
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,640
is in your territory.

444
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:19,480
I guess

445
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,000
he can do anything.

446
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,000
This time you use him

447
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:25,760
to get rid of the witness second class soldier.

448
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,960
to prevent the involvement of

449
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,360
from the Horn incident.

450
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:34,200
you can rest assured.

451
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,360
Colonel.

452
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,280
Colonel.

453
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,760
Colonel.

454
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,560
Colonel.

455
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:50,760
Colonel.

456
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:04,120
What are you doing?

457
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,120
I deserve to die.

458
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,480
And you.

459
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,840
You have always been cautious.

460
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:14,760
Why are you so reckless this time?

461
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:19,280
The important witness of Colonel died.

462
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:20,480
Because

463
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,120
the Korean Republican Party will attack the colonel.

464
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,520
In order to protect him,

465
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,920
to protect Colonel.

466
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,480
I had no idea

467
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,200
the witness would commit suicide.

468
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:28,760
And he never thought

469
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,200
he had a self-destruct device.

470
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,200
Colonel.

471
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,480
Are you okay?

472
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,080
Why did you say he committed suicide?

473
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:46,600
How did you know?

474
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,240
He had an explosion device on him.

475
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,400
I'm really sorry.

476
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,280
I seriously suspect

477
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,360
you wanted to kill my witness.

478
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:06,280
Colonel.

479
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,840
How did you know the Commander would attack us?

480
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,880
You said you wanted to protect me.

481
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,800
Why are we the ones who got attacked?

482
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,800
This is a misunderstanding.

483
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,200
Why did you steal my witness?

484
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,120
Colonel.

485
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,640
I believe there must be

486
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,600
there must be a misunderstanding.

487
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,640
Misunderstanding?

488
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,120
What misunderstanding?

489
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,080
What should I tell His Majesty?

490
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:26,280
Colonel.

491
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,800
In my jurisdiction,

492
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,880
in my jurisdiction,

493
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,480
and almost endangered your life.

494
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:34,600
I'm truly sorry.

495
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,200
I'm so sorry.

496
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,880
I'm going back to Sambu Island.

497
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,240
Prepare a plane for me.

498
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,320
I'm sorry.

499
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,240
Here.

500
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,640
Colonel, are you going back to Sambu Island?

501
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,520
Don’t you need to go back to the palace?

502
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,160
Colonel.

503
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,000
Calm down.

504
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:56,840
Calm down.

505
00:41:56,840 --> 00:41:57,840
Get lost.

506
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,000
Calm down.

507
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,400
Please calm down.

508
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,480
Colonel.

509
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:04,120
I'll only say it once.

510

In two hours,

511
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,640
