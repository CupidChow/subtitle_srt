1
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:40,080
You must drink a lot in the palace.

2
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,880
It's just that after work,

3
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,360
I'll drink a little when I get home.

4
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,520
After all, I often have missions.

5
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,759
Women and wine.

6
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,160
Among the army and Navy,

7
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,320
are indispensable.

8
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,280
Actually,

9
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,800
I'm on a mission.

10
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,600
Drinking is against the rules.

11
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,840
But Captain Oshima is so generous.

12
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,680
If I don't drink it,

13
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,680
if I don't drink.

14
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,320
So I'll make an exception today.

15
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,520
I'm so stupid.

16
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:12,880
But we're at Airlines 6.

17
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,600
It's okay to drink some.

18
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:20,800
His Majesty's personal guard.

19
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,160
It must be very mysterious.

20
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:31,720
Can you tell us about the palace?

21
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:34,480
Especially the guards

22
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,520
who have unique skills.

23
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,920
Colonel.

24
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:39,800
Inaki.

25
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,240
He grew up in China.

26
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,520
He doesn’t know much about Japan.

27
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:48,720
Colonel, can you talk to him?

28
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,720
Please.

29
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,720
They won't tell anyone.

30
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,720
Right?

31
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,960
His Majesty's personal guard

32
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,320
is a group of nine.

33
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,040
I'm not included.

34
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,200
What is your main task

35
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,079
your main mission?

36
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,400
Our mission

37
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:26,800
is to ensure

38
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,400
their loyalty to His Majesty.

39
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,680
Not only do they work and live,

40
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,640
and everything outside,

41
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,520
are in our surveillance at any time.

42
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,400
So

43
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,280
the palace investigators often go out.

44
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:43,560
It's really rare

45
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,120
to go out like this.

46
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,840
So for the Navy and the Army,

47
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,880
those adults

48
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,400
need your help.

49
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,360
It's easy for us

50
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,120
it's easy for us

51
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,520
to meet some big shots.

52
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,280
But we won't use them.

53
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,520
In our Chief Guard's words,

54
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:05,080
if the Navy or Army

55
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,680
the Navy or the Army,

56
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,040
What a joke!

57
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,360
Unbelievable.

58
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,960
I see.

59
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,760
What do you mean?

60
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,560
In fact, we're just shield of survival.

61
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:19,880
At the same time,

62
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,160
some secrets.

63
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,080
For someone,

64
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,040
we are also hidden dangers.

65
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,280
We've met too many people.

66
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,720
in front of His Majesty.

67
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,280
in front of His Majesty.

68
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,240
[Flirting]

69
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,360
and sow discord.

70
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,760
Of course they don't want

71
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,240
to be remembered by others.

72
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,360
Really?

73
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,960
That's enough.

74
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,480
It's going to be leaked.

75
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,040
Cheers.

76
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:55,960
By the way,

77
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,120
Irigami.

78
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,080
Bring me the best wine.

79
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,600
There's no good wine.

80
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,840
That's it.

81
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,080
There is.

82
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,480
I'll get it right away.

83
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,960
Wait for me.

84
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,280
There's good wine.

85
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,280
Let me do it.

86
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,720
Here's the wine.

87
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,760
Please.

88
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,160
Colonel.

89
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,600
Hot wine.

90
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,200
Don't miss it.

91
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,520
Only three drinks.

92
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,760
This is the rules of the Servant Room Iron.

93
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,480
You work outside.

94
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,880
Don't mind the rules in the palace.

95
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Fukuda.

96
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:23,800
You're here.

97
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,280
Do you have beer?

98
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,040
Yes.

99
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,120
Please get me a bottle.

100
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,120
Right away.

101
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,320
In order not to disappoint you,

102
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,760
I'll have some beer with you.

103
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,480
This bottle of wine...

104
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,480
for me.

105
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,280
I can't drink much.

106
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,480
I’d better buy it to you.

107
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,480
Please.

108
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,120
I dare not drink for you.

109
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,159
I heard that Oshima-san can drink a lot.

110
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,720
I really want to see it.

111
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,280
It'll get cold if you push more.

112
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,600
Let Mr. Akino decide.

113
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,640
I think this bottle of wine

114
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,360
should be returned to its owner.

115
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,080
Colonel.

116
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:05,960
Please.

117
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,720
Colonel.

118
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,480
If you keep delaying it,

119
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,200
I can only think that

120
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,600
people from your palace

121
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,200
look down on

122
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,200
basic soldiers.

123
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,560
All these years,

124
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,520
I've been serving His Majesty

125
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,880
and serve him.

126
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:34,640
It's rare to get out.

127
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,680
This time,

128
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,480
although

129
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,840
such a remote place,

130
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,480
But I saw

131
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,960
Everyone here

132
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,960
for His Majesty.

133
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,840
I was very excited.

134
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,400
Please allow me to take the initiative.

135
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,840
Cheers.

136
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,240
Thank you so much.

137
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,480
Fukuda.

138
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,400
Don't be shy.

139
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,159
We are

140
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,120
who are loyal to His Majesty.

141
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,840
Thank you.

142
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,559
Colonel.

143
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,480
Here.

144
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,120
Okay.

145
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,080
Please.

146
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,760
For Your Majesty.

147
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,040
For the Empire of Japan!

148
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,520
Cheers!

149
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,400
Cheers.

150
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,800
Mr. Ye,

151
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,960
I'll say it again.

152
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,480
Our country is in danger.

153
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,960
We must cooperate.

154
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:33,160
What do you think?

155
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,160
Let's work together.

156
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,080
If you need anything,

157
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,720
we’ll try our best

158
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,880
and Macau Station.

159
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,600
Let's protect the people on the island

160
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,120
and Miss Ye's father.

161
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,960
ask you

162
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,800
Can we use

163
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,600
Can we use it?

164
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,880
No problem.

165
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,480
I think this will work.

166
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,080
Fatt

167
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:02,880
Come on.

168
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,560
Here's to you.

169
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,600
Thank you.

170
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,320
Mr. Ye.

171
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,240
I have a letter

172
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,320
to the island tonight.

173
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,240
Can I use it?

174
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,000
No problem.

175
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,920
Leave it to me.

176
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,560
Father.

177
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,920
I'm sorry.

178
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,400
I didn't become

179
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,120
a real samurai.

180
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,560
have no courage to go to the battlefield.

181
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,720
I can only stay here

182
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,760
here.

183
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,720
Let me tell you something.

184
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,320
The wine you drink

185
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,240
have been mixed with water.

186
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,960
Many foods are expired

187
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,960
I'm sorry.

188
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,640
Stop it.

189
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,600
Calm down.

190
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,840
Colonel is here.

191
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,600
You must be tired.

192
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,880
Let’s end it here.

193
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,000
Good night.

194
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,880
It's okay.

195
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,680
I think everyone is happy.

196
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,920
But indeed,

197
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,880
It's getting late tonight.

198
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,400
I’m almost done.

199
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:33,800
Colonel, please.

200
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,200
You can’t leave.

201
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,200
Colonel.

202
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,200
You can’t go back now.

203
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,360
Our leader

204
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,280
have something to tell you.

205
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,360
The leader has always been suspicious.

206
00:11:58,920 --> 00:11:59,920
What's wrong?

207
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:04,520
What happened?

208
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:05,400
Come on.

209
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,280
Let's continue drinking.

210
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,280
Drink!

211
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,520
Oshima-san!

212
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,280
Thank you for the dinner.

213
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:17,160
Thank you for coming.

214
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,760
Drunk is divided into two situations.

215
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,120
One is drunk harassment type.

216
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,720
and the other is sober.

217
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,160
Captain Akino should be the last one.

218
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,840
It's just that his legs aren't working well.

219
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,920
By the way,

220
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:32,240
I have a favor to ask.

221
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,040
Can you use your car?

222
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,040
to send Captain Akino

223
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,840
to the base dorm.

224
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:36,960
OK.

225
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,000
Colonel.

226
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,520
Aren’t you going back to the airport?

227
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,160
Yes.

228
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,120
There are some things

229
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,920
a witness hasn't finished yet.

230
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,280
It's late.

231
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,880
Forget about today.

232
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,480
The habit of being in the attendant room for years.

233
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,920
What happened today must end today.

234
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:52,720
Please.

235
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,840
All right.

236
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,040
Take Mr. Akino to the car.

237
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,360
I'm with Commander.

238
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,160
I'm watching you.

239
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,280
Commander...

240
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:19,160
Stop it.

241
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,680
Get him into the car.

242
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,680
Yes.

243
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,960
Long live the Emperor!

244
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,880
Oshima-san, I'll get going too.

245
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,480
Goodbye.

246
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,360
Come here.

247
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,520
Ask the well to come out.

248
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,360
Yes.

249
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,800
How's the Major?

250
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,400
I just changed his dressing.

251
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,600
Can you walk?

252
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,680
Is the gauze ready?

253
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,480
Yes.

254
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,320
What about Dragon Hero?

255
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,600
He's waiting at the beach.

256
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,080
Ju is also in the hospital.

257
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,000
Okay.

258
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,600
I'll go to the hospital now.

259
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:07,520
Wait for me here.

260
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,520
I'll come back to pick you up.

261
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,000
After you go to the hospital,

262
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,360
let's play it by ear.

263
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,400
I'm leaving.

264
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,160
Be careful.

265
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,160
Okay.

266
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,480
You are a second-class soldier of the airport garrison.

267
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,880
Leiji?

268
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:46,360
What's wrong with him?

269
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:50,840
He can't talk because his skull is injured.

270
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:52,840
I see.

271
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,880
I'm an investigator from Tokyo.

272
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,200
I'm Ichiro Takemichi.

273
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,880
I have some questions for you.

274
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,280
If it's you, nod

275
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,720
If it's not you, shake your head.

276
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:02,480
Okay?

277
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,520
I need you to recall

278
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:07,720
On February 3, 4 last year,

279
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,680
the special plane of General Kokuri

280
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,040
During daily maintenance and maintenance

281
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,920
maintenance and maintenance,

282
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,840
you were one of the flight attendants.

283
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,680
right?

284
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,000
That's good.

285
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,800
I need to ask you

286
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,040
to ask you in detail.

287
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,360
Can you take a car?

288
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,600
Are you the nurse who takes care of him?

289
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:31,960
Yes.

290
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,480
I need to take him out.

291
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,400
It'll take about half an hour.

292
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,080
You take care of him.

293
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,120
Is there a problem?

294
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,360
Yes.

295
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,720
Go get a wheelchair.

296
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:44,800
Yes.

297
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,599
Carry him into the car.

298
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:05,599
Yes.

299
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,800
Ah.

300
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,360
What?

301
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,920
What did you say?

302
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,360
I don't understand.

303
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,520
You want to go back to the hospital?

304
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,320
Okay.

305
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,920
I'll send you back right away.

306
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,040
I'll take you home.

307
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,520
Hold him tight.

308
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,640
I knocked him out.

309
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,600
Can you handle it well?

310
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:41,840
Make it clean.

311
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,480
Remember to keep your clothes.

312
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:44,840
Bye.

313
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:49,800
Take care.

314
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:10,240
Ju.

315
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,240
Take it.

316
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,880
Tell him when you get to hell.

317
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,680
I sent you here

318
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,040
sent you here.

319
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:08,960
Sir.

320
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,240
I've finished

321
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,480
Done.

322
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:15,760
Please take a look.

323
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,240
Not bad.

324
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,240
You have to work harder.

325
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,320
and send this plan

326
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:38,520
to Commander Fujita.

327
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,120
Do I need your approval?

328
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,480
He won't.

329
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,480
The Navy's general...

330
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,480
...is to take responsibility.

331
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,360
We just need to

332
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,280
the plan.

333
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:50,640
Yes.

334
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:51,640
Thank you.

335
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:42,880
This is

336
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,920
on April 12th.

337
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:46,960
The captain asked me

338
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,080
to give it to you in person.

339
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,080
I know.

340
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,320
Oshima Hao called just now.

341
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:54,880
I mean...

342
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,080
Are you sure you want to do this?

343
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:57,480
Yes.

344
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,000
Habha!

345
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,720
If you get rid of

346
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,800
on the island,

347
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,800
It's safe.

348
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,560
The Navy and Navy

349
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,560
the Navy and Navy navigators.

350
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,120
Have you done an evaluation?

351
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:11,640
Captain Oshima asked us

352
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,960
to contact the Tuo Minister.

353
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,240
and request for

354
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,600
as soon as possible.

355
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,600
How many people

356
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,320
How many immigrants?

357
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,800
Get ready soon.

358
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,960
Prepare to move from Okinawa

359
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,320
from Okinawa.

360
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,920
That's a big deal.

361
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,960
How many copies have you printed?

362
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:32,960
Just one.

363
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,360
Captain Oshima asked us

364
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:35,800
to give orders

365
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,160
will be given verbal orders.

366
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,120
You may leave.

367
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,280
I’m leaving.

368
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,800
General, it's time for your medicine.

369
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,240
Habha!

370
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,880
A investigator from Tokyo.

371
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,280
We're investigating today.

372
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,320
the sentry soldiers who worked for General Tai Kok last year.

373
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,200
And...

374
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,840
the airport guards and the Special Forces Police Brigade

375
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,120
All the participants

376
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,800
were asked to question.

377
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:27,680
Okay.

378
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:28,840
Okay.

379
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,800
Do you need me to keep the documents?

380
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:34,960
No.

381
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:35,880
I can do it myself.

382
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,600
I'll take my leave.

383
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,560
Fujita is introverted and sharp.

384
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,960
I can tell

385
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,200
the purpose of the Special Forces Police Brigade.

386
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,200
But

387
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,920
he would never

388
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,160
sign his name

389
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,000
on this document.

390
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,480
He doesn't want to take the responsibility.

391
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,480
Stay in the car.

392
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,360
Don't move.

393
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,880
Fukuda.

394
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,080
Colonel.

395
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,200
It’s late.

396
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,960
Why are you still here?

397
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,000
I'm with my woman.

398
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,560
shouldn't you stay away from me?

399
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,000
Not to get closer.

400
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:36,080
With all due respect,

401
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,280
why do you put a Chinese woman

402
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,920
by your side?

403
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:43,480
Japanese women are 100 times better than her.

404
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,320
If you need,

405
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,480
I can introduce you anytime.

406
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,360
The best in my place.

407
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:53,640
What are you talking about?

408
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,000
I'm tired.

409
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,840
Go back.

410
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,160
Shut up!

411
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,280
You ugly woman.

412
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,120
It's none of your business

413
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,960
is none of your business.

414
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,480
I'm sorry.

415
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:06,760
Move.

416
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:07,760
Yes.

417
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:10,960
Please.

418
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:31,400
Heavy 08596.

419
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,160
Slow down.

420
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,720
Do you think that Yankee

421
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,240
is still hiding somewhere?

422
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,560
Well...

423
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,160
It's such a big island.

424
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,120
To be honest,

425
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,480
I've searched everywhere.

426
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:17,160
I found his hideout,

427
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:20,360
but I couldn't find him.

428
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,960
Where else could he be hiding?

429
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,080
I think so too.

430
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,480
I lost my goal.

431
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,480
Don't panic.

432
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,880
Just keep an eye on

433
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,480
our suspects.

434
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,720
will find him soon.

435
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,920
The colonel is driving our car.

436
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,880
We can't keep an eye on him.

437
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,480
Yeah.

438
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,680
We can't follow them

439
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,560
follow them.

440
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,480
We need to take the initiative.

441
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,680
Sasaki.

442
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,320
Yes.

443
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,720
After breakfast,

444
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,720
Go and get Fukuda

445
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,040
and the maintenance meeting.

446
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,000
His name is Tang Bingchen.

447
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,120
Bring them here.

448
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,400
I need to explain to them

449
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,200
the plan I told you yesterday.

450
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,480
Okay.

451
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,040
I’ll go after eating.

452
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:25,480
Captain.

453
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,560
What was it called?

454
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:27,680
This is

455
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,960
killing two birds with one stone.

456
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,880
No.

457
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,920
It should be killing three birds with one stone.

458
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,200
The key point of this plan is...

459
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,320
Inaki.

460
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,120
By then,

461
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,720
take a patrol boat

462
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,280
with a fishing boat.

463
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,040
In this way,

464
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:48,480
to make the fishermen feel at ease

465
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,480
and make the Macao people feel

466
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:55,040
we're not on guard.

467
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,720
Also,

468
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,480
that Yankee hiding in the dark

469
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,880
might be waiting for the chance to move out.

470
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,080
4 p.m.

471
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,920
gather all fishing boats.

472
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:13,640
At 4:30,

473
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,680
I'm in Hengqin Island.

474
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,320
I led the other four patrol boats

475
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:19,640
to this sea.

476
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:22,400
It's estimated that

477
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,640
The mafia in Macau

478
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,320
and Jiang Zheng Quan's boats

479
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,960
It's time to show up.

480
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,840
and catch them all.

481
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,880
That way,

482
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,080
the unstable young men

483
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,080
on the island.

484
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,840
And

485
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,760
we can catch the Yankees.

486
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,360
This is killing three birds with one stone.

487
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,600
That's brilliant.

488
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:50,960
Sasaki.

489
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,560
Find out what happened yesterday.

490
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,720
where

491
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,560
with that woman?

492
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,320
Got it.

493
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,080
Xia.

494
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:17,640
I have news.

495
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,640
Two letters.

496
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:40,000
Big Tiger and Little Tiger have been lost.

497
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,000
Don't be anxious.

498
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,560
I will negotiate with the chiefs

499
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,320
and come up with another plan.

500
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,760
Cut.

501
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,680
Please give the other letter to Ying'er.

502
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,360
There's no word

503
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,400
It's for Ying Er

504
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,760
Ying Er

505
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,720
Ying Er

506
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,200
Ying Er.

507
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:23,520
Dad.

508
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:25,080
What's the rush?

509
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,600
This is a letter from your uncle.

510
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:27,600
He said it's for you.

511
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,200
For me?

512
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,000
It should be for Takemichi.

513
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,160
I'll send it to him.

514
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,000
Mr. Tang.

515
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,040
Okay.

516
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,680
Thank you.

517
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,480
Captain Oshima.

518
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,200
So early?

519
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,800
so early.

520
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:05,880
Is there

521
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,760
something urgent?

522
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,040
It's the end of April.

523
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:11,720
is the Emperor's birthday.

524
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,760
The Marines

525
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,080
the Navy will prepare for a celebration.

526
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,720
This year,

527
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,320
we plan to lift the sea ban

528
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,320
and organize all young fishermen

529
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,520
to conduct a fishing activity.

530
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,480
We hope

531
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,480
we can verify

532
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,800
the list of capturing people going to sea.

533
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,240
As for the specific time,

534
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,360
the police force will inform you.

535
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,520
That is to say,

536
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,480
We can sail!

537
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:44,240
If the villagers know this good news,

538
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,800
they will

539
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,640
thank you, Captain Oshima.

540
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,960
That's right.

541
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,080
Old people and young children

542
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:56,000
Soldiers and ordinary citizens

543
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:57,560
Everyone

544
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,880
should celebrate for His Majesty.

545
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:03,280
Go back and tell everyone.

546
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,400
to prepare for the fishing.

547
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,800
Then...

548
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,880
[The fish we caught this time is Fukuda Trade Bank.]

549
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,280
Fukuda Trading

550
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,840
will purchase everything

551
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,040
according to the market price.

552
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,360
Okay.

553
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,639
I'll tell the villagers

554
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:21,639
to the villagers.

555
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,360
Chairman Tang.

556
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:26,800
The fishing boat and staff

557
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,719
must be registered.

558
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,000
Let Fukuda

559
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,239
take someone and maintenance to do it together.

560
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,080
Good job.

561
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,880
Did Sasaki tell you? Yes.

562
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:52,400
Yes.

563
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,239
Yes.

564
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,639
You have to go to every family.

565
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:56,520
Yes.

566
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,480
Understood.

567
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:58,800
All the young men on the island

568
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:03,480
will be listed on this sail list.

569
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,480
One more thing.

570
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,920
Secret investigation.

571
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,200
Who's keeping pigeons?

572
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,480
Pigeon?

573
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:17,000
Keep it a secret.

574
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,360
Don't let too many people know.

575
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,640
Yes.

576
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,080
When the list is ready,

577
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,160
let me know right away.

578
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,080
Fukuda will go with you.

579
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:31,480
Okay.

580
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:34,600
Captain.

581
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,080
Did you find anything?

582
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,480
They went to the military hospital yesterday.

583
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,560
Military hospital.

584
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:42,920
Captain.

585
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,480
What’s the hurry?

586
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,760
Captain, we stay

587
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,240
in the cave

588
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,120
We found this at the corner of the dandelion grass.

589
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,000
To the military hospital.

590
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,080
We found a lot of doubts on Mount Mudang.

591
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,400
Takemuki came to the military hospital yesterday.

592
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,760
Why did he come to the military hospital?

593
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,240
What's the connection?

594
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,160
Great.

595
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,480
Your fever is gone.

596
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,520
Thank you.

597
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:47,680
After a few more days,

598
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,680
the inflammation should be gone.

599
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,760
What medicine is this?

600
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:21,760
Penicillin.

601
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,800
Has there been

602
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,720
at the base hospital recently?

603
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:30,880
No.

604
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,760
Absolutely not.

605
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,520
Are you sure?

606
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,640
Captain Oshima.

607
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,920
Although this medicine is penicillin,

608
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,600
but I'm not sure

609
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,080
it was from our hospital.

610
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:41,080
You are the only hospital in the base.

611
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,680
All teams have this medicine.

612
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,360
Anyway, I can guarantee

613
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,360
this medicine

614
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,600
in our hospital.

615
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,480
It will never happen.

616
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,360
lost.

617
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,480
You've been in the hospital these days?

618
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,080
Yes.

619
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,120
Is there anyone suspicious?

620
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:56,720
No.

621
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,240
Did Colonel Takemuki and his woman

622
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,480
come here?

623
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,760
Yes.

624
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,600
What are you doing here?

625
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,240
Colonel came to prescribe some medicine.

626
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,280
That woman

627
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,240
almost had a conflict

628
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,080
with a patient.

629
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,640
Be specific.

630
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:14,520
A patient

631
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,520
was harsh to Nurse Tang.

632
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:18,160
In order to protect her,

633
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,160
she seems to know some medical skills.

634
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,680
How do you know?

635
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,360
She said some medical terms.

636
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,880
But his assistant

637
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,360
It's normal to speak some medical terms.

638
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,840
What medicine did Colonel prescribe?

639
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,800
Colonel is an old TB.

640
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:34,360
and prescribed some medicine for his lungs.

641
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,520
Do you have this medicine?

642
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,080
No.

643
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,240
It's getting interesting.

644
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,880
Do you trust this doctor?

645
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,400
The Penicillin incident

646
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,880
is a lie.

647
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,920
But about the Colonel we talked about later,

648
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:56,400
He doesn’t need to protect him.

649
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,480
Tell him

650
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,280
we're here to ask him today.

651
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,200
about our questioning today.

652
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,040
What should we do next?

653
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,760
Of course.

654
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,400
to see the colonel's woman.

655
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,000
of the Colonel woman.

656
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,480
Oshima Hao.

657
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,600
Oshimahao is here.

658
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,560
What's wrong?

659
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,960
Oshima Hao is here.

660
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,120
Oshima Hao

661
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,040
Who is it?

662
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,400
Captain of the Police Brigade on the island.

663
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,360
Don't panic.

664
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,400
Just do what you usually do.

665
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:47,480
Don't panic.

666
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,480
He won't come in.

667
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:54,360
He won't come in.

668
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:56,280
Remember,

669
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,120
You can't talk.

670
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:15,800
Let's take a look.

671
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,920
This is...

672
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,320
The one who was broken by the villagers.

673
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,400
Private?

674
00:41:37,880 --> 00:41:37,960
Private second class Yang

675
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,760
Hey.

676
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,840
Let me ask you something.

677
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,040
Captain Oshima!

678
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,480
His pelvis

679
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,400
was injured by the villagers using hoes.

680
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:05,600
I can't talk.

681
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,160
