1
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,440
Sir,

2
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,450
your clothes have been delivered.

3
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,370
Good morning, Colonel Takeki.

4
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,240
Good morning.

5
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,440
This is the Chief of Staff of the Shanghai Garrison,

6
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,240
Major General Tangchuan Yasuo.

7
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:34,000
This is Mr. Inoue Akira.

8
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,320
I am the General's adjutant.

9
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,500
Please come in.

10
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,640
Commander Sawada Shigeru has gone to Nanjing.

11
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,160
I heard someone from the Imperial Palace has arrived,

12
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,320
so I came to meet you instead.

13
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,050
So early in the morning.

14
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,980
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

15
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:54,960
Not at all.

16
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:55,920
Please, General.

17
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,450
Alright.

18
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,520
I checked the records.

19
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,240
We received it several days ago.

20
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,200
The notification from Military Command.

21
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,320
After Commander Takeda Shigeru approved it,

22
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,840
he went to Nanjing.

23
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,160
I overlooked you, Colonel.

24
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,600
That's why Inoue had

25
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,760
a conflict with you.

26
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,040
Wumu,

27
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,680
I'm really sorry.

28
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,960
Not at all, General.

29
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,160
It's fine.

30
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,440
Regarding intelligence channels,

31
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,300
someone's been looking after me.

32
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,079
It's Major Takizawa from Intelligence, isn't it?

33
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,400
You two were classmates, right?

34
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:49,800
Yes.

35
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,160
I've dreamed countless times

36
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,360
about our first night together.

37
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,880
But now,

38
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,200
my mission

39
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,040
forces me to share a room

40
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,040
with a stranger.

41
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:18,360
You intelligence people are so tight-lipped.

42
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,959
Major Takizawa didn't report anything either.

43
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:24,320
I hadn't heard a word about this.

44
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,480
I'm terribly sorry.

45
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,010
I asked him to keep it quiet.

46
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:47,920
I know you've come all the way to Shanghai, Colonel.

47
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,240
You must be carrying an important mission from His Majesty.

48
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,159
I shouldn't ask too many questions.

49
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:59,880
Just tell me what you need from me.

50
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,960
I will fully cooperate.

51
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:03,840
Very good.

52
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,520
How long do you plan to stay in Shanghai, Colonel?

53
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:09,840
My business in Shanghai

54
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,170
is basically finished.

55
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:13,360
There's a ship tonight

56
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,120
heading to the Sixth Air Base.

57
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,920
I have some matters to attend to there.

58
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,280
I would like your department

59
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:20,120
to provide me with two special passes

60
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,120
and the best cabin accommodations.

61
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,640
I'll handle this matter.

62
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,400
Since our intelligence department's

63
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,600
advisor Major Takizawa has been

64
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,159
secretly accompanying the envoy these days,

65
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:34,480
I'll call the military police

66
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,680
and have Major Takizawa

67
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,040
accompany you to handle it.

68
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,000
Thank you, General.

69
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,130
I'm counting on you.

70
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,920
Colonel,

71
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,240
do you understand English?

72
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:47,640
A little bit.

73
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,159
I heard from my son

74
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,480
that the commander of the Sixth Air Base,

75
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,520
Mr. Fujita,

76
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,780
is also quite knowledgeable in English.

77
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,360
Yes.

78
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:58,960
This book is what I'm taking to the island

79
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,560
to give to Commander Fujita.

80
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:06,360
The book the Colonel is giving to Commander Fujita

81
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,440
must be quite insightful.

82
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,280
May I borrow it for a read?

83
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:13,800
Of course.

84
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:14,600
You may.

85
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:29,400
It seems Commander Fujita is quite knowledgeable.

86
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:31,680
Yes.

87
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,200
I'll go buy a copy myself the day after tomorrow.

88
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,159
Such a good book.

89
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:42,880
May I have a look at it?

90
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,400
Please.

91
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,240
Inoue,

92
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,680
do you really understand it?

93
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,360
The words on this page know me,

94
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,960
but I don't know them.

95
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,960
I have a subordinate who can read English.

96
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,800
Can he read it to me?

97
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,200
What's written on this paper?

98
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:28,800
Wait.

99
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,400
Just a moment.

100
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:35,000
I was reading this book last night.

101
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,680
I just happened to be on this page.

102
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,400
I was afraid I'd forget,

103
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,400
so I took a piece of paper

104
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,640
and placed it here

105
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,680
to make it easier to continue reading next time.

106
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,880
Inoue.

107
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,120
If you'd like to read it, please go ahead.

108
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,800
When I return to Shanghai next time,

109
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,200
I'll come get it from you.

110
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,000
No, that won't be necessary.

111
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,520
This is something you're giving to Commander Fujita.

112
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,980
How dare I take what belongs to someone else.

113
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:57,800
Colonel.

114
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:58,400
Yes, sir.

115
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:00,280
Tonight,

116
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,480
on behalf of

117
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,280
Commander Zeda Shigeru of the Shanghai Garrison, I'd like to host a dinner

118
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,810
to entertain you, Colonel,

119
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,240
as a gesture of hospitality.

120
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,370
Thank you, General.

121
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:10,400
However, tonight

122
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,040
I've already arranged to meet an important client.

123
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,160
And tonight I'll be taking a boat

124
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,440
to the 6th Naval Base.

125
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,200
So,

126
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,520
wait until next time.

127
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,160
When I return,

128
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,440
we'll drink to our heart's content.

129
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,680
That works too.

130
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,600
By then, Commander Sawada Shigeru

131
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,530
should be back in Shanghai as well.

132
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:28,960
Inoue,

133
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,320
I'm leaving tonight.

134
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,159
Please tell your men to stop following me,

135
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:33,960
would you?

136
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,280
Inoue,

137
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,799
if this is happening,

138
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,780
it absolutely must not continue.

139
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,360
I understand.

140
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:54,960
Come out.

141
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,040
They're gone.

142
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,610
That really scared me to death.

143
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,280
I'm sorry.

144
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,240
What is this?

145
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,280
What gives you the right to enter my room?

146
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:38,610
Getting to know each other, like you said.

147
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,900
Where's the original one?

148
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:41,680
I threw it away.

149
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,210
Flushed it down the toilet.

150
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,560
So...

151
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,000
You've seen it.

152
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,360
Childish.

153
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:50,760
That's my property.

154
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,640
How dare you take it without permission?

155
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,520
Didn't your supervisor tell you before you came?

156
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,000
That nothing

157
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,160
should be recorded in written form.

158
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,490
Did they tell you or not?

159
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,640
Didn't your supervisor tell you

160
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,800
not to take other people's belongings?

161
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,280
So...

162
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:03,290
Mine.

163
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,660
What are you doing?

164
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:05,400
[Flushing]

165
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:05,840
What are you doing?

166
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:06,320
Give it back to me.

167
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,240
That's me sleeping.

168
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,640
You can't show it to anyone.

169
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,640
Give it back to me!

170
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,240
Wumu Yilang.

171
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,120
Did you return

172
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:18,960
my things?

173
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,410
Getting dressed and going out.

174
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,280
Any progress with the envoy?

175
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:36,960
Major Ferguson

176
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,760
has arrived at our base in India.

177
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,040
But after Japan invaded Burma,

178
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,800
all air and ground routes were cut off.

179
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,680
Once the new routes are ready,

180
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,040
we can prepare to depart.

181
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,040
The situation is becoming clearer.

182
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,720
Damn Himalayas.

183
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,060
I don't know how planes can fly over them.

184
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:53,400
Sir,

185
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,400
trust our pilots.

186
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,280
I'll definitely figure out a way.

187
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,400
Speaking of pilots,

188
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,240
how are Doolittle and the boys doing?

189
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,800
Colonel Doolittle and his men are preparing

190
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,930
to launch B-25s from the carrier deck.

191
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,840
Tomorrow they'll fly to Sacramento

192
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,100
for further training.

193
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,280
Tell Doolittle

194
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,640
this operation must be foolproof.

195
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,600
The Japanese are about to take the Philippines.

196
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:15,600
I want this raid to happen as soon as possible.

197
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,640
Call him right now.

198
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,170
Yes, sir.

199
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:21,880
Sir,

200
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,920
we've made the following necessary modifications:

201
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,600
Removed the belly turret

202
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,040
and replaced it with a 50-gallon fuel tank.

203
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,400
Added four auxiliary fuel tanks

204
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:32,160
bringing each aircraft's fuel capacity

205
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,200
to 1,141 gallons.

206
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,400
Modified the bombsights

207
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,400
for low-altitude bombing.

208
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,040
A small camera has been installed in the tail of the aircraft.

209
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,240
Many radio devices have been removed

210
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,960
to reduce weight.

211
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,040
De-icers have also been installed on the wings,

212
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:48,570
correct?

213
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,880
Okay, and finally...

214
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,200
Finally what?

215
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,280
The tail gun has been

216
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,600
replaced with a painted wooden stick.

217
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,080
As per your orders, sir.

218
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,240
Tow the aircraft to the test runway.

219
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,970
Colonel, is that really a broomstick?

220
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,040
Have I ever told you

221
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,600
about my father's hobbies?

222
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,600
Carpenter.

223
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,720
Just like Jesus Christ and the Savior.

224
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,520
My father could make

225
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,960
rifles out of wood with more firepower than a machine gun.

226
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:25,720
Trust me.

227
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,040
I know what I'm going to do with this thing.

228
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:28,640
Yes, sir.

229
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,320
In case my plane

230
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:30,920
runs into Hitler's aircraft,

231
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,050
I'll just poke it down with that stick.

232
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,650
Get this one ready for takeoff.

233
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,520
7701 taxiing to runway.

234
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,720
7701 cleared for test flight.

235
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,800
7702 taxiing to runway.

236
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:50,800
Copy that.

237
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:57,160
7701 test flight on 250-meter runway.

238
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,160
Understood.

239
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,440
Is it still because the aircraft is too heavy?

240
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:32,040
No problem. Let's try again.

241
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:37,560
7702, test flight on 250-meter runway.

242
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,560
7702 copy that.

243
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,240
Cole.

244
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:43,160
Remember what I taught you.

245
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,320
Keep the flaps down.

246
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,880
Pull back on the stick.

247
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,600
Don't fall back into your old habits.

248
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,520
Yes, sir.

249
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,480
Flaps down.

250
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:14,900
Full throttle.

251
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,010
Throttle

252
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:26,840
ready.

253
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:44,960
Come on, baby, lift off!

254
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,040
We made it!

255
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,360
That was awesome!

256
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,760
We did it!

257
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,600
7702.

258
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,320
Successfully took off from a 250-meter runway.

259
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,480
Congratulations.

260
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,520
Prepare the next aircraft. Get everything ready.

261
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:31,840
Sir.

262
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:32,520
Sir.

263
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:33,440
Sir.

264
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,560
The machine guns on the other planes haven't been removed yet.

265
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,960
What are you waiting for?

266
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,280
You're right.

267
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:45,840
Boys, you've seen Cole's performance.

268
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,600
All planes should take off according to this standard.

269
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,440
Let's do it.

270
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,240
Thank you.

271
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,440
We will be leaving later today

272
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,560
on the Japanese transport ship Amemaru

273
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,290
from Huangpu Port in Shanghai.

274
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,840
It's a journey of one day and two nights.

275
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,960
We should arrive around 5 a.m. the day after tomorrow

276
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,080
at Sanzao Island

277
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,680
at the Navy's Sixth Air Base.

278
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,640
That's great!

279
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,420
We can finally go home.

280
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,200
Takizawa has figured out

281
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,560
the situation on the ship.

282
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,280
They're mostly Japanese soldiers.

283
00:16:57,280 --> 00:16:58,680
There are only two Chinese people.

284
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,800
One is Commander Fujita's translator from the island.

285
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,130
And the other one is you.

286
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,040
By the way,

287
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,520
that book you gave me,

288
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:10,400
I think

289
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,530
I found the part you're interested in.

290
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,690
Tell me about it.

291
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,400
The author, Homan Lai,

292
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,000
accurately predicted the Pearl Harbor attack.

293
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,640
He said

294
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,359
Japan would launch surprise attacks on

295
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:21,560
Pearl Harbor naval base,

296
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,200
Guam and the Philippines.

297
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,160
The route would be

298
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,760
the northern Pacific route.

299
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:28,800
Isn't that the same route

300
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,730
Japan used to attack Pearl Harbor?

301
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,680
I remember he wrote in this book that

302
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,760
early Sunday morning,

303
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,360
the US Pacific Fleet's

304
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,400
home base at Pearl Harbor,

305
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,200
200 nautical miles to the north,

306
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,880
the eastern horizon was beginning to lighten,

307
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,360
the peaceful dawn was approaching.

308
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,240
A massive fleet

309
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,520
along a route never used by merchant ships,

310
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:50,760
the northern Pacific route,

311
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,720
breaking the silence

312
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,800
gradually heading south toward Pearl Harbor.

313
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,160
This massive fleet

314
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:57,160
consisted of aircraft carriers

315
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,440
arranged in two columns as the main formation.

316
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,200
Several fast battleships at each corner

317
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,680
and heavy cruisers.

318
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,520
Destroyers formed the outer perimeter.

319
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,040
And in front of this ring of steel,

320
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:11,680
leading the way were several light cruisers

321
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,800
and submarines.

322
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,440
On the deck of each aircraft carrier

323
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,400
were rows of planes with wings spread

324
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,880
and engines running.

325
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:22,040
Hanging beneath their fuselages were

326
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,240
either heavy bombs or torpedoes.

327
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,440
The lead-gray torpedo casings

328
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,900
gleamed with a cold light.

329
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,000
What's wrong?

330
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,890
You memorized all that after reading it once?

331
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,440
This amazing American writer

332
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,880
accurately predicted in his book

333
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:44,640
a few months ago,

334
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,480
the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor

335
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,880
with complete accuracy.

336
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,680
When was this book published?

337
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,520
1925.

338
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,240
1925.

339
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,040
At that time, Yamamoto Isoroku

340
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,800
was a military attaché at the Washington embassy.

341
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:02,320
Fujita was an assistant military attaché at the New York consulate.

342
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,280
I believe Yamamoto

343
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,680
must have read this book.

344
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:05,560
Now I understand

345
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,440
why Fujita has been looking for this book.

346
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,160
He wants to find

347
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,820
Yamamoto's line of thinking.

348
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,900
These high-ranking officers

349
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,690
aren't interested in martial arts displays.

350
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,520
I've been searching for a key

351
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,020
to unlock their minds.

352
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,880
You've helped me find it.

353
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,970
I've done something great!

354
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,160
Sorry to disturb your meal.

355
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:42,920
Go ahead.

356
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,920
Sanzao Island sent a telegram.

357
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,040
The day after tomorrow morning,

358
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,480
there will be a transport plane flying from Shanghai to Sanzao Island.

359
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,680
General Tangchuan Anfu suggests

360
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:53,080
that you take this plane.

361
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,320
The women accompanying you

362
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:58,280
can travel to the island by boat first.

363
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,160
Regarding this sudden change,

364
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,640
Wumu used the opportunity of checking the schedule

365
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:07,600
to quickly weigh the pros and cons of this development.

366
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:08,200
Suddenly,

367
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,240
he realized

368
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,160
he couldn't refuse this arrangement.

369
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,160
The Japanese military hierarchy is strict.

370
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,800
If a high-ranking officer refused

371
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,880
this mere two-hour flight,

372
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,320
and chose for himself and his female companion

373
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,760
to drift at sea for two nights and a day instead,

374
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:22,080
it would quickly raise

375
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,320
Major General Tangchuan Anfu's suspicions.

376
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,640
Please thank the General for me,

377
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:26,800
and inform him that

378
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,440
I will take the plane,

379
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,680
while my girlfriend will travel by boat.

380
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:30,520
Yes, sir.

381
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,000
Thank you.

382
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,260
I'll take my leave now.

383
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,120
What's wrong?

384
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,920
It's me, Wumu.

385
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,650
There's been a change of plans.

386
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,800
Tang Anchuanfu's deputy

387
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,680
came to see me

388
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,680
and said that the day after tomorrow morning,

389
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,940
there's a plane flying to Sanzao Island.

390
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,240
This means

391
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,220
Miss Ye will have to take the boat by herself.

392
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,000
The question is whether it's safe.

393
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,800
There shouldn't be any problem,

394
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,640
but we need to make proper arrangements.

395
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,440
I understand.

396
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,440
I have to go alone, right?

397
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,360
Takizawa and I will arrange for you to board the ship.

398
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,280
The ship

399
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:25,480
is full of Japanese soldiers.

400
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,240
Besides the Japanese soldiers,

401
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,880
there are also some non-combatants,

402
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,540
but they're all connected to the Sixth Air Base.

403
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,960
Takizawa and I will make arrangements.

404
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:34,490
They won't dare to harm you.

405
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:36,640
Okay.

406
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,200
So...

407
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,640
I want to freshen up.

408
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,680
I don't want to see my father like this.

409
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,040
Okay.

410
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,460
No matter who you meet on the ship,

411
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:52,640
don't discuss politics.

412
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,820
Whatever happens,

413
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,800
remember to stay silent.

414
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,020
I'll arrive on the island only 5 hours after you.

415
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:04,840
Also,

416
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,960
there's a special situation

417
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,540
I feel I need to tell you about.

418
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,800
If anything goes wrong

419
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,800
and you fall into the hands of the Japanese military police,

420
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,520
their typical interrogation method

421
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,920
is to first bring in a hot-tempered officer.

422
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,780
He will beat you

423
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:36,800
and insult you.

424
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,600
Threaten you.

425
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,960
Make you feel extremely terrified.

426
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
Just when you're on the verge of breaking down,

427
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
an officer of higher rank will appear,

428
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,860
but with a much gentler attitude.

429
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,840
He will be very friendly to you.

430
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,370
You'll feel grateful to him

431
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,760
and involuntarily tell him

432
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,960
everything you know.

433
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,730
Especially at that moment,

434
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,940
remember, you must hold firm.

435
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,600
So

436
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,680
I might get arrested.

437
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:23,040
I understand. You may go.

438
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,000
Let's go back.

439
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,100
We're making no progress here at all.

440
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,560
That's impossible.

441
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:34,530
Should we search again?

442
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,280
No need.

443
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:37,400
All units can return to base.

444
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,520
Let's check with the coastal defense unit

445
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:47,080
and see if their search yielded anything.

446
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,930
First squad, follow me.

447
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:58,400
Sasaki,

448
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,800
tell Tang Bingchen, the chairman of the maintenance association,

449
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,640
to come to my office.

450
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,610
Should we search underground?

451
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,240
About face! Forward march!

452
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,240
This isn't over yet.

453
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:45,720
Ju'er.

454
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,160
How did you get in here?

455
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,800
If the Japanese find out, we're done for.

456
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,320
Why couldn't you come to my house if you needed something?

457
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,320
I won't go to your house.

458
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,080
I'm afraid I can't control my temper.

459
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:55,800
I am who I am.

460
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,760
My father is who he is.

461
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:00,040
Ju'er.

462
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,040
It's not that I'm afraid to go to your house.

463
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,640
What if I get into an argument with your father?

464
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,300
That would be awkward for you.

465
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,400
Anyway, let's not talk about this.

466
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,720
I came to see you for something.

467
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,720
Where does your hospital usually keep the medicines?

468
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:13,820
Why are you asking about this?

469
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,200
Well...

470
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,680
My mother-in-law accidentally cut her arm.

471
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,240
I want to get her some medicine.

472
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,640
Your mother-in-law is hurt?

473
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,440
Is it serious?

474
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,640
I could come by after work to check on her.

475
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,240
No, no.

476
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:24,680
That's not necessary.

477
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,000
It's not serious.

478
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,120
I just want to find some penicillin for her.

479
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,160
Just stop asking so many questions.

480
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,480
Just tell me where your pharmacy is.

481
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:35,760
Even if I tell you where it is,

482
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,290
you won't be able to get any.

483
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,330
All those medicines are locked up.

484
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,240
What should I do then?

485
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,100
How about this.

486
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,480
I'll go to the comfort station

487
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,680
for routine inspection

488
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,210
and try to get you two doses.

489
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,060
Really?

490
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,360
That's great.

491
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,880
Is it dangerous?

492
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,370
Don't worry. It's fine.

493
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:58,640
That's good then.

494
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,200
I'll go now.

495
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,200
Be careful.

496
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,200
Okay, bye.

497
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:25,960
[Chong 59362]

498
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,080
Everything is arranged.

499
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,720
When we arrive at the dock,

500
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,480
I'll call the captain over

501
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,300
so you can meet each other.

502
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,210
Don't worry.

503
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,840
He's quite timid.

504
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,810
The captain is from Kyushu.

505
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,240
When we get there,

506
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:47,200
I'll instruct him

507
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,460
to ensure your safety.

508
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,940
Give me your gun first.

509
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,960
What do you need my gun for?

510
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,080
When we get to the dock,

511
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,280
I'll give you the gun

512
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,600
in front of everyone,

513
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,520
so they know you have a weapon to protect yourself.

514
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,240
Can I

515
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,960
stop by the department store?

516
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:20,850
There's still time.

517
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,620
What do you need to buy?

518
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,820
Something unrelated to the mission.

519
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,530
I'm going to buy glasses for my dad.

520
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,920
Let's go.

521
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,780
You need to hug me before we leave.

522
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,360
What?

523
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,330
Colonel.

524
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:52,330
Captain.

525
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:53,960
This is our Colonel.

526
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:54,520
Colonel.

527
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,020
Take good care of my woman.

528
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:04,840
If anything happens to her,

529
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,440
no matter where you go,

530
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,480
I will find you.

531
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:09,160
Yes, Colonel.

532
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,860
Keep this with you.

533
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,640
If anything unexpected happens,

534
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:15,300
use this to protect yourself.

535
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,560
Go now.

536
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,160
Let's go.

537
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,920
Don't be so reluctant.

538
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,720
Is this your cabin?

539
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:56,760
The best cabin on this ship.

540
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,760
Shanghai authorities strictly ordered me

541
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:01,960
to give it up.

542
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,720
I thought

543
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,400
some important figure was coming,

544
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:07,280
but it turns out to be

545
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,680
a Chinese woman.

546
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,560
My name is Fukuda.

547
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,000
All the supplies for the Sixth Air Base

548
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,400
are brought by me.

549
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:24,720
If you need money on the island, you can come to me.

550
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,040
I also have a

551
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,770
workplace specifically for women on the island.

552
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:31,120
By the way,

553
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,620
you can also come to me if you don't have a job.

554
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:36,320
I don't need a job,

555
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,570
and I don't know you.

556
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,210
Would you please leave?

557
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:40,920
Mr. Fukuda,

558
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:43,280
what brings you here?

559
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,610
I'm not looking for you.

560
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,280
I'm looking for the captain.

561
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,010
You're all brainless animals.

562
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,520
Don't mind him.

563
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,120
This man is Fukuda.

564
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:56,420
He's a very unpleasant Japanese man.

565
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,000
The place he just mentioned

566
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,400
that offers jobs to women

567
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,610
is actually a comfort station for the Imperial Army.

568
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,340
My name is Luo Zhiyong.

569
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,760
I work at the Sixth Aviation Base

570
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,680
as Commander Fujita's translator.

571
00:31:09,680 --> 00:31:10,840
I am Chinese.

572
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,360
I'm Ye Biying.

573
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,720
If I'm not mistaken,

574
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,800
this is the first time a Chinese woman has appeared on this ship.

575
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:21,440
And

576
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,620
you're staying in the best cabin.

577
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,320
Why?

578
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,760
Who is that Chinese woman?

579
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,440
Mr. Fukuda, please understand my situation.

580
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,970
I'm just following orders.

581
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,080
Following orders?

582
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:36,040
Whose orders?

583
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,640
The best cabin has always been mine.

584
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,600
How could it be given to a Chinese woman?

585
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,660
She's not an ordinary Chinese woman.

586
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,980
Not an ordinary woman?

587
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,400
She's nothing more than a Chinese woman.

588
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,080
They are all inferior animals.

589
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,600
They don't deserve any special treatment.

590
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,560
What did he say?

591
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,120
Is it related to what just happened?

592
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,690
Just some offensive words.

593
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,440
Better you don't understand them.

594
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,900
So they won't dirty a beautiful lady's ears.

595
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,640
Stop making a scene here.

596
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,540
Let me tell you.

597
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,890
She's with the Colonel.

598
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:08,920
Whatever cabin the Colonel says she stays in,

599
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,720
that's where she stays.

600
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,380
Your complaints are useless.

601
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,000
Damn it.

602
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,120
This cabin you were supposed to stay in

603
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,720
belongs to a Colonel.

604
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,640
A friend.

605
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,600
A friend of the Colonel.

606
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,280
I'm not feeling well.

607
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,720
I need to go back and rest.

608
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,660
Good night.

609
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,940
So why are you here?

610
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,600
I met Director Shen yesterday.

611
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:57,680
He told me the details of the operation.

612
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,000
He asked me to get the password,

613
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,160
wavelength and call sign.

614
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,560
After the radio beacon,

615
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,200
I'll eliminate my assistant

616
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,120
and that messenger,

617
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:05,180
then escape alone.

618
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,650
Different approaches to planning

619
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,560
will naturally lead to different results.

620
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,580
They only guarantee my safety alone.

621
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,210
They're only ensuring your safety alone.

622
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,050
You'll definitely be free.

623
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,720
Without special reasons,

624
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,400
the Naval Sixth Air Base

625
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,880
wouldn't dare stop you.

626
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,320
Do you want to follow the Military Intelligence plan?

627
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,360
How could I?

628
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:36,200
Of course I'll follow your plan, sir.

629
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,440
If you're not following the Military Intelligence plan,

630
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,680
your immediate priority

631
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,240
is to create a new plan.

632
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,440
The Japanese army's logistics in Shanghai

633
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:46,560
and their military postal system -

634
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,080
which department

635
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,360
is responsible for that?

636
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,020
The system is extremely vast.

637
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,600
I recall the Shanghai Expeditionary Force

638
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,200
does have a supply depot.

639
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,520
It's mainly responsible for

640
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,800
ammunition, fuel, food,

641
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,640
medical and other logistical support.

642
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,360
They also have a

643
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,560
military postal system.

644
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,800
But who exactly is in charge,

645
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,040
I'll need to check.

646
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,320
If I need to transport

647
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,199
an important wounded soldier back to Japan,

648
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,400
who should I contact?

649
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:14,719
The Medical Department.

650
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:17,920
They have a patient transport unit

651
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,820
that handles this.

652
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,560
If I need to check an important letter,

653
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,489
who should I ask?

654
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:24,940
Military mail system.

655
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:25,920
If you need to,

656
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,600
I can take you there anytime.

657
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,960
We'll move tomorrow.

658
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:51,120
His biggest confusion right now

659
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,840
is about this American,

660
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,640
what kind of mission

661
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:55,840
he came to China with.

662
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,040
Behind this mission,

663
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:02,200
what kind of action plan is it based on?

664
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,160
This is the mystery

665
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,640
he hopes to solve quickly.

666
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,240
This is Wumu's last time

667
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,570
reviewing the action plan after landing.

668
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:15,770
He knows clearly

669
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,760
that a wounded American

670
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,720
plus a completely inexperienced female assistant

671
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,650
crossing the sea

672
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,920
This mission

673
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:27,450
means all kinds of unexpected difficulties.

674
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,920
He must immediately arrange

675
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,840
an alternative evacuation route.

676
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,840
Make way!

677
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,080
Coming through!

678
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,280
Excuse me!

679
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:13,640
Newspapers for sale!

680
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:19,760
I'm sorry.

681
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,760
It's alright.

682
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,200
Someone's still here.

683
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,200
Don't open it.

684
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,520
Stay away from me.

685
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,560
Get lost.

686
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,560
This way, sir.

687
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,160
Who's in charge here?

688
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,160
I'm the captain here.

689
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,880
Garrison Intelligence Section.

690
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,800
Hello.

691
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,880
Is there somewhere we can talk?

692
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:00,520
Yes.

693
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,720
I need to track down a letter

694
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,360
sent by a high-ranking officer 7 days ago.

695
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,220
Can you find it?

696
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:21,360
I'm afraid it's already reached Tokyo.

697
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,000
Could it be that fast?

698
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,080
Who's responsible for the security check of the letters?

699
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,280
Regarding security checks,

700
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,440
they're handled by various divisions

701
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,720
and brigades' intelligence sections.

702
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,780
We only manage transportation and distribution here.

703
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,440
After letters arrive here,

704
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,600
how often are they sent back to the homeland?

705
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,160
On average, every 15 days

706
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,200
there's a postal aircraft

707
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,600
that takes them back home.

708
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,880
Once every 15 days?

709
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,560
I'm looking for a letter from 7 days ago.

710
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,760
Why can't it be found?

711
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,720
Because besides

712
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,720
our postal aircraft,

713
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,920
there's also Nanjing Headquarters,

714
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,360
the Sixth Air Base,

715
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,720
and even postal planes from Hainan Headquarters

716
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,920
that take letters back from here.

717
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:56,640
Do you have a schedule

718
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,840
for these postal planes

719
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,440
with their exact arrival and departure times

720
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,440
at your facility?

721
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:01,760
Bring it here.

722
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,520
Can I take one to go?

723
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,720
Such fierce special police.

724
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,800
The Sixth Air Base,

725
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,720
we've confirmed the postal aircraft's arrival and departure times.

726
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:32,080
Next, we need to

727
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,480
transport the injured American pilot out.

728
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:42,900
Put your hat on.

729
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:48,760
This is

730
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:51,160
Colonel Takeki Ichiro, the investigator.

731
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,360
Colonel,

732
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:54,800
please give your orders.

733
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:55,930
I'm at your service.

734
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,240
I have a very important patient,

735
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,800
a high-ranking officer.

736
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,930
I need to send him back to our homeland.

737
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,840
I'll process his paperwork right away.

738
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,440
He's still in a hospital at the front line.

739
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,880
The conditions there are terrible.

740
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,080
I need to transfer him first

741
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,040
to your facility for treatment,

742
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:12,100
then you can transport him back home.

743
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,680
Which war zone hospital is he in?

744
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,320
I'll arrange the paperwork to transfer him here.

745
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,850
You don't need to know that.

746
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,580
Give me a casualty transfer form.

747
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,840
I need your signature and stamp

748
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,520
to approve receiving this patient.

749
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:35,640
Hetian Changxiu.

750
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,600
Colonel, sir.

751
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,880
I need to see your

752
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:49,160
Imperial Chamberlain Investigation Department credentials.

753
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,960
I'm Takizawa from the Intelligence Section at headquarters.

754
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:55,880
The Colonel's orders

755
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,880
must be followed without question.

756
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,090
As for the hospital,

757
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,060
I'll go there and talk to them.

758
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,600
The messenger jumped out

759
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,640
of a shot-down aircraft.

760
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,840
I doubt they're in one piece.

761
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,570
Most likely severely injured.

762
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:10,880
A woman,

763
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:12,010
a badly injured one.

764
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,360
That's more than you can handle.

765
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,410
With this arrangement,

766
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,440
Following the Shanghai underground party's instructions,

767
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,840
Wumu and Takizawa cleverly

768
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:26,320
prepared the third evacuation route.
