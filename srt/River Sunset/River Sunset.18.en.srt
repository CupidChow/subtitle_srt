1
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:35,440
How could this happen?

2
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,039
Was our information leaked?

3
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,400
I don't know either.

4
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,560
Their boat had just left

5
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,280
when they encountered the enemy patrol boat.

6
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,800
Later I heard intense gunfire.

7
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,520
Then Ying'er and Wumu

8
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,400
swam back supporting the Major.

9
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,160
But they couldn't escape.

10
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,880
Your uncle must be worried sick.

11
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,360
Hurry up

12
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,640
and send him a message.

13
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,600
Longxia.

14
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:33,840
I shouldn't have

15
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,440
persuaded you to smuggle Major White to Macau.

16
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:40,210
I shouldn't have promised Major White

17
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,840
to help him escape without telling you.

18
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:46,410
And I shouldn't have ignored your advice.

19
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:51,540
I'm responsible for Dahu and Erhu's deaths.

20
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,040
I am your superior

21
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,170
and responsible for all your actions.

22
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,720
I failed to stop

23
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,050
your operation in time.

24
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,930
It's not your fault.

25
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,440
But today when you saved White,

26
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,960
the courage you showed

27
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,320
made me see you in a new light.

28
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,960
Why are you staring at me?

29
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,520
I'm not going to blame you.

30
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,840
I'd rather

31
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,640
you scold me like you usually do.

32
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:31,880
I just hope

33
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,120
that whatever decision you make in the future,

34
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,560
you'll discuss it with me first.

35
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:40,880
Alright?

36
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,130
I remember when I came to Shanghai,

37
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,600
one of my former teachers told me

38
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,880
that I have a fatal flaw in my character.

39
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,540
Sometimes I'm too soft-hearted.

40
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,000
It often affects my judgment,

41
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,060
influences my decisions,

42
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,880
and leads me off the right track.

43
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,770
For the deaths of the brothers,

44
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:26,280
I take full responsibility.

45
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,820
You don't need to feel guilty.

46
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,180
The war has gone on for so long.

47
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,210
I've witnessed countless deaths.

48
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,680
But today is the first time

49
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,440
I've felt death

50
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,200
so close to my loved ones,

51
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,560
right before my eyes.

52
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,640
My mother.

53
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,400
All my comrades are in Tokyo.

54
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,900
Although they're far from the battlefield now,

55
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,040
Major White's words today

56
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,000
force me to think about

57
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,720
what kind of retaliation

58
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,680
America will take against Japan.

59
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,120
Will it be harmful to Japan's homeland?

60
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,360
If that day really comes,

61
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,800
then my mother

62
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,940
and my comrades...

63
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,680
Is there nothing we can do?

64
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,320
Now we should think about

65
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,040
the most basic emotional connections

66
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,600
between people.

67
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,720
Then transcend

68
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,600
beyond what most people can.

69
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,690
Forget these troubles.

70
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,840
Clear away these distractions.

71
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,840
This is what I should be doing right now.

72
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,840
I can't do that.

73
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,480
What you need to do now

74
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,200
is control your emotions

75
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,970
and avoid exposing your identity.

76
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,520
There might be many more

77
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,520
situations like this in the future.

78
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,960
But fortunately,

79
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,920
the Major is still alive.

80
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,360
He still needs you.

81
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,600
Our mission isn't complete yet.

82
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,040
I've said too much.

83
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,280
I don't know why I'm telling

84
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,540
a woman I've known for less than two weeks

85
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,600
so many things.

86
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,720
Get some sleep.

87
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:18,280
I am Yumiko

88
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,640
Takahashi Nobuo.

89
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,920
We will sacrifice ourselves.

90
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,240
You don't want Yumiko to be involved.

91
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,679
I never expected this.

92
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,880
I never saw it coming.

93
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,640
Takahashi Nobuo,

94
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:38,559
treason.

95
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,679
Takahashi Nobuo.

96
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,960
Oshima,

97
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,200
the commander is asking

98
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,840
what happened last night.

99
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,500
You mean about last night?

100
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,480
A small boat from Macau sneaked onto the island.

101
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,330
Two people were killed.

102
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,280
One smuggling boat seized.

103
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,090
What was this boat doing coming to the island?

104
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:03,960
Not sure.

105
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,960
Right now,

106
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,560
Inoue and Sasaki are investigating the scene.

107
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,280
Okay.

108
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,700
How about this.

109
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,920
Find some time to come to headquarters

110
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:15,050
and report to the commander in person.

111
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,240
All right.

112
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,040
But right now,

113
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,920
there are still many things we haven't figured out.

114
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,400
When things become clearer,

115
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,720
I'll come over.

116
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,960
Please let them know.

117
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,160
Sure.

118
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:48,360
Everyone, fall in.

119
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,880
About face.

120
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,140
Dismissed.

121
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:05,680
Captain.

122
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,800
Good morning.

123
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,920
Been busy all night?

124
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,520
Yes.

125
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,560
Well,

126
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,600
we found some footprints.

127
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,080
Footprints?

128
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:15,640
That's right.

129
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,040
But the tide came in last night,

130
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,800
washing away all the footprints on the beach.

131
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:20,960
However, near our

132
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,240
abandoned bunker No. 41,

133
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,040
we still found some footprints.

134
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,530
Footprints of several people.

135
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,840
Quite a few,

136
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,920
at least three or four people.

137
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,840
Three or four people?

138
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,640
So,

139
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,770
behind this illegal border crossing,

140
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,040
there's more people and things involved.

141
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,240
I suppose so.

142
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,400
Inoue,

143
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,120
is this border crossing incident

144
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,640
a coincidence or

145
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,800
some failed conspiracy?

146
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:54,960
Captain,

147
00:11:55,400 --> 00:12:00,120
it's clearly a planned crossing.

148
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,920
Someone arranged it.

149
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:09,600
On our completely sealed off

150
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,560
Sanzao Island,

151
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,080
how did they communicate with the outside?

152
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,680
How did they make contact?

153
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:18,680
Not sure.

154
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,520
Could these events be connected to someone

155
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,720
on the inside?

156
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,200
Or perhaps,

157
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,040
could it be related to those

158
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,700
who landed from the plane that we haven't found?

159
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:39,800
Captain.

160
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,240
From the crime scene,

161
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,640
there must be someone on the island

162
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,520
waiting for this smuggling boat.

163
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,240
After being spotted by our patrol boat,

164
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,240
once we fired shots,

165
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,380
these people got scared and ran away.

166
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,250
Who were those people on shore?

167
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,700
It's all very mysterious.

168
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:04,320
We don't have any leads at all.

169
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,720
Captain.

170
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,520
Captain.

171
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,040
Captain.

172
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,900
Why don't you all take a break?

173
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,480
We've been at this all night.

174
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,480
I'm going to get some sleep.

175
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:21,880
Good work.

176
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,410
Yes, sir.

177
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,720
Captain,

178
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,100
the bodies of those two guys have been brought back.

179
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,600
Last night at the Colonel's place,

180
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,360
there didn't seem to be anything unusual.

181
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,360
I believe we have no way

182
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,200
to restrict his freedom of movement.

183
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,520
So he had no reason to smuggle himself

184
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,180
and make such a basic mistake.

185
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,080
Who exactly is this woman?

186
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,440
Uncle Yi,

187
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:41,900
they haven't arrived yet.

188
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,920
It seems the chances of survival are slim.

189
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,360
Should we keep waiting?

190
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,560
You all wait a bit longer.

191
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,650
I'll go ahead first.

192
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,480
If you manage to get them,

193
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,400
immediately send someone to report back home.

194
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,920
Chairman Tang,

195
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,000
please identify

196
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,960
if you know these two people.

197
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,200
Take a good look.

198
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,260
Do you know them or not?

199
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,880
They look like the brothers from

200
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,160
Caotang Village, Dahu and Xiaohu.

201
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,760
After you arrived,

202
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,400
they fled to Macau.

203
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,760
How did they end up dead here?

204
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:51,000
Caotang Village?

205
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,080
Who from Tanjiawan

206
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,280
is connected to them?

207
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,640
I really don't know.

208
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,250
These two will be publicly displayed.

209
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:07,000
As chairman of the maintenance committee,

210
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,360
you must inform everyone on the island.

211
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,680
This is what happens

212
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,180
to those who oppose us.

213
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,620
Do you understand?

214
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,040
Go.

215
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,280
This way.

216
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,820
Tang Bingchen's words just reminded me.

217
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,280
Are our people who stayed at Caotang Mountain yesterday

218
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,240
still there?

219
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,330
They haven't returned yet.

220
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,000
Tell them to keep watching carefully.

221
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,800
Yes.

222
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,640
Go to Tanjiawan Village

223
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:38,480
and investigate.

224
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,240
Tanjiawan?

225
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:39,960
Yes.

226
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,600
If you find any suspicious individuals,

227
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,060
arrest them immediately.

228
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:43,320
Yes.

229
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,850
I'm going to headquarters.

230
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,560
Slow down.

231
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,320
Don't run.

232
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,000
Stop running.

233
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:03,960
Okay, let's go.

234
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,240
Don't run.

235
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,040
Stop running.

236
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,319
Come, put the stool here.

237
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,359
Right here.

238
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:13,560
Come.

239
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,160
Everyone come for the photo.

240
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,000
Move the stool a bit this way.

241
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,000
Sir.

242
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,460
Time for the photo.

243
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,440
Sir.

244
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:30,840
Ying'er, Xia'er.

245
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:31,440
Come quickly.

246
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,320
It's time for the photo.

247
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:32,960
Okay.

248
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:34,920
Let's go.

249
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:47,960
3, 2, 1.

250
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,920
3, 2, 1.

251
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,480
Sir.

252
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,880
Sir.

253
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,600
Sir.

254
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,720
I've been waiting until now.

255
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,840
There's no news from these two brothers.

256
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,500
And the boat hasn't returned.

257
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,690
It looks like something really happened.

258
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,890
I guess the young master and miss are both on the boat.

259
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,440
What should we do now?

260
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,680
Send a carrier pigeon back to ask

261
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,040
what happened at home.

262
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,680
I'll do it right away.

263
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,720
Also,

264
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,240
that Director Shen from the Nationalist

265
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,970
Military Intelligence who came here last night,

266
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,080
seems to

267
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,240
have a way to contact the island.

268
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,120
Send someone to find Wu Fazi

269
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,520
to ask around.

270
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,240
Alright.

271
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:57,770
Ask where they're staying.

272
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,960
Tell them I'm asking for their help.

273
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,840
We need to find out what happened on the island.

274
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,880
We must get to the bottom of this.

275
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,680
See what information they have.

276
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,520
I'll go now.

277
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,290
There's a letter from home.

278
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,600
Dahu and Xiaohu were both killed.

279
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:30,800
This...

280
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,760
At least Xia'er and Ying'er are safe.

281
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,120
Keep this absolutely quiet.

282
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,410
Don't let them discuss it with anyone.

283
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,840
Should we write back to them?

284
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,120
Slow down. Slow down.

285
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,760
Let me think.

286
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,560
What did Wu Fazi say?

287
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,080
He said he still hopes you two can meet.

288
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,680
Arrange it as soon as possible.

289
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,360
The compensation for Brother Erhu's family.

290
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,080
Everything according to our rules.

291
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,440
Additionally, I want to provide extra support.

292
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,640
A house for the widow and orphans.

293
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,360
To support them for the rest of their lives.

294
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,440
I'll arrange it right away.

295
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,160
Wait.

296
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,880
Go personally to Director Shen.

297
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:23,760
Tell him

298
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,960
I'm hosting a dinner at my home tonight.

299
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,100
I wish to have a detailed conversation with him.

300
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:36,760
I asked someone to bring your coat

301
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,800
as well.

302
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,960
Get dressed and we'll be ready to go.

303
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,580
Why is this so difficult to put on?

304
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:44,480
This morning,

305
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,080
we need to first visit the reading hall

306
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,040
to check if everything is in order there.

307
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,400
Then we'll go to the hospital

308
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,760
to get some medicine according to your prescription

309
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,840
for Major Weite.

310
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,920
Afterward, I'll take you home.

311
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:57,180
I need to gather the anti-aircraft gun squad for a meeting.

312
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,740
I'm not going home.

313
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,480
I need to go see Major Witt directly.

314
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,280
His body can't hold up much longer.

315
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:02,800
No.

316
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,930
The fewer people who go to that place, the better.

317
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,040
I'm telling you this

318
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:07,920
as a doctor.

319
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:08,800
I understand.

320
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,600
I already witnessed it last night.

321
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,130
Let's go.

322
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,480
You've been looking at it all morning.

323
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,360
Do you understand what you're seeing?

324
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:13,890
Let's go.

325
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,890
Did someone sneak onto the island?

326
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,440
Or did island residents smuggle themselves out?

327
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,920
The specific case is still under investigation.

328
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:07,650
It seems to be people from Macau

329
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,680
who were caught by patrol boats

330
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,610
while smuggling themselves back.

331
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,840
Since the establishment of this base,

332
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,100
similar incidents have been occurring.

333
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,080
Have you forgotten about that large rock at Yashan

334
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,160
with the names of Imperial Japanese

335
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,560
soldiers carved into it?

336
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,960
I wouldn't dare forget, sir.

337
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,440
There are already 40 names

338
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,560
of naval officers and soldiers carved there.

339
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:30,440
So in these past few years,

340
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,840
40 people have been killed?

341
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,720
Yes.

342
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,320
A few days ago,

343
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,060
a sentry from the garrison

344
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,690
mysteriously disappeared again.

345
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,400
Yesterday,

346
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,280
the northern part of the base

347
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:47,360
was inexplicably attacked,

348
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,090
and a similar situation occurred again at night.

349
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,920
Aren't you going to give me an explanation?

350
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,880
It's my fault.

351
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,760
Weren't you suspecting

352
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,960
that an American had also

353
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,690
landed on the island recently?

354
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,980
Do you have any results on these matters?

355
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,200
Not yet.

356
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,400
If such incidents continue to happen,

357
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,960
with the base's security in your hands,

358
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,280
how can I feel at ease?

359
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,010
Understood.

360
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:22,880
We'll work quickly

361
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,080
to solve these cases.

362
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,560
Then tell me,

363
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,460
how long will it take to clear this up?

364
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,240
Within one week.

365
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,920
Fine.

366
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,690
I'll wait for your results.

367
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,900
I will search with all my efforts.

368
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,680
Thank you so much.

369
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:45,880
Come in.

370
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,720
Thank you all for your hard work.

371
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:51,200
Compared to other places,

372
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,200
this is probably

373
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,460
the safest place on the island right now.

374
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:57,050
I wonder how the Major is doing inside.

375
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,200
Although yesterday's emergency treatment was successful,

376
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,200
he still needs

377
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:01,480
follow-up medication to recover.

378
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,600
What I'm most worried about now is

379
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,260
that he might develop a fever.

380
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,240
Let's go to the base hospital now

381
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,160
to get some medicine for him

382
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,160
and bring it over tonight.

383
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:09,880
Okay.

384
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,520
Attention, everyone!

385
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,720
Last night, the Imperial Army caught

386
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,120
two illegal immigrants.

387
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,360
They have been executed on the spot

388
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,440
and their bodies displayed publicly

389
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,080
as a warning to others.

390
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,520
Kewen! Kewen!

391
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,080
Don't play here.

392
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:03,920
Kewen!

393
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:04,520
Go away!

394
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:04,880
Hurry!

395
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,400
I want to be lifted up too!

396
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:06,960
Kewen!

397
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,820
This is not a place for you to play.

398
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,160
Come on, quickly!

399
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:12,080
Lift me up!

400
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,300
What are you doing?

401
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,960
This is a sick child.

402
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,360
Why are you scaring him?

403
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,040
Kewen! Kewen!

404
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:22,520
Let's go now.

405
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,440
This isn't a place for you to play.

406
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,720
Hurry!

407
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,960
Are you hungry?

408
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,440
Come on.

409
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,800
I'll take you to find something to eat.

410
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,760
Let's go.

411
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,680
Don't play around here.

412
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:34,210
Let's go.

413
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,360
Keep announcing.

414
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,120
Attention, everyone!

415
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,720
Last night, the Imperial Army caught two illegal immigrants.

416
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,560
They have already been executed on the spot

417
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:48,040
with their bodies displayed publicly

418
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,880
as a warning to others.

419
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:55,440
They have been executed on the spot.

420
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,760
Throw it away. It's dirty.

421
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,220
Bodies on public display.

422
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:58,960
Don't move.

423
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,760
As a warning to others.

424
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,000
Attention, everyone!

425
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,760
Last night, the Imperial Army caught two illegal immigrants.

426
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,360
They have been executed on the spot.

427
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,290
Throw that away.

428
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,080
We're here.

429
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,000
The bodies are displayed publicly

430
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,160
as a warning to others.

431
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:12,680
Mrs. Si,

432
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,760
is De Gong here?

433
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,080
What is it now?

434
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,400
Wen is hungry.

435
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,560
Get him something to eat.

436
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,920
I need to speak with De Gong about something.

437
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,440
No,

438
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,320
keep going.

439
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,040
Grandma will get you something to eat.

440
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,600
Everyone, attention!

441
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,720
Last night, the Imperial Army caught two illegal immigrants.

442
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:30,960
Mrs. Si, I'm going in.

443
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,560
They have already been executed on the spot by the Imperial Army.

444
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,440
De Gong!

445
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,080
Bingchen.

446
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,520
What is it?

447
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,200
In Houshan Caotang Village,

448
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,120
the two brothers Da Hu and Xiao Hu

449
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,520
secretly came back home.

450
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,120
They were caught by the Japanese

451
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,080
and killed.

452
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,260
Their bodies are being publicly displayed now.

453
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,920
The people of Houshan Caotang Village

454
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,980
all died at the hands of the Japanese.

455
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,560
The Qingming Festival

456
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,760
is approaching soon.

457
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,080
These two young men

458
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,260
came back secretly

459
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,480
just to burn some joss paper

460
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,280
and visit their ancestors' graves.

461
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:12,120
How could they be executed for that?

462
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,800
I assume they came back

463
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,160
just for this reason.

464
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,680
These Japanese are truly heartless.

465
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,680
Who would disagree?

466
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,880
These two boys

467
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,800
are hanging there for public display.

468
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,920
They won't return the bodies

469
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,440
and they're even shouting

470
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,240
for villagers to come and watch.

471
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,800
Is there any humanity left in them?

472
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:35,920
De Gong,

473
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,580
I don't want to do this either.

474
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,640
A stone can be broken but not lose its hardness,

475
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,620
cinnabar can be ground but not lose its redness.

476
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:47,920
If we can't retrieve these children's bodies,

477
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:51,320
how can we call ourselves people of Sanzao Island?

478
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,000
Then what do you suggest we do?

479
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:56,980
We must give these children a proper burial.

480
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,080
De Gong,

481
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,880
let me be honest with you.

482
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,960
This is a trap set by the Japanese.

483
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,920
They're waiting for someone to collect the bodies,

484
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,780
and they'll arrest whoever goes.

485
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,040
I have a plan.

486
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,080
Wumu.

487
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,600
Can I go see Ju'er?

488
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,840
Be careful.

489
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,320
Don't take too long.

490
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,120
Hmm.

491
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,400
Sir.

492
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,480
Sir.

493
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,280
What seems to be troubling you?

494
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,400
I have chronic tuberculosis.

495
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,880
When I'm overworked,

496
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,810
I start coughing

497
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,970
and feel tightness in my chest.

498
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,360
The other day at Commander Fujita's,

499
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:26,600
I had some drinks

500
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,060
and even coughed up blood.

501
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,320
This disease can't be completely cured.

502
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,840
It can only be controlled with medication.

503
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,560
I came in a hurry and didn't bring enough medicine,

504
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,620
so I need you to prescribe some for me.

505
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:47,040
This disease is indeed difficult to cure completely.

506
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,210
Patients often feel tired and in pain.

507
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:51,330
And now with the changing seasons,

508
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,260
your condition might worsen.

509
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,440
Colonel,

510
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,720
why don't I examine you first?

511
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,120
That won't be necessary.

512
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,760
I've already written down

513
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,120
all the medications I need on this paper.

514
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,400
Just get them for me.

515
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,320
Yes.

516
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,960
Please wait a moment.

517
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,320
I'll go to the pharmacy and get your medicine myself.

518
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,240
Thank you.

519
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,320
Let me go!

520
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,840
Let go of me!

521
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,600
Release me!

522
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:00,360
Ju'er,

523
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:03,880
are you okay?

524
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,360
Biying,

525
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,440
what's going on?

526
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:10,400
The wound is quite serious.

527
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,530
It needs treatment.

528
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:14,680
Don't worry.

529
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,210
The wound needs treatment.

530
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,040
We'll change your dressing.

531
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,440
Come help.

532
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,480
I'll hold him steady

533
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,300
while you apply the medicine.

534
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:24,960
Stay calm.

535
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,080
Don't be nervous.

536
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,680
Why are you losing your temper?

537
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,480
This behavior isn't helping.

538
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:32,800
What's happening?

539
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,960
What's going on here?

540
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,400
This wound wasn't properly treated,

541
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,400
resulting in skin ulceration,

542
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,000
ischemic necrosis of soft tissue,

543
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,560
and traumatic infection.

544
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,240
But he shouldn't keep

545
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,700
lashing out at the nurses.

546
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,280
Who are you?

547
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,440
She came to see me.

548
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,120
Are you a doctor?

549
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,890
How do you know all this?

550
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,560
What's going on?

551
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,480
Colonel.

552
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,840
This patient had a conflict with the nurse.

553
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,320
This Chinese woman knows some medicine.

554
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,250
I'm investigating the situation.

555
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,440
What's your name?

556
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,040
Xiao Zun.

557
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:06,880
Dr. Xiao Zun.

558
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,640
This lady is my assistant.

559
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,920
She knows some medical basics.

560
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,040
Is there a problem?

561
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,520
Everything's fine here.

562
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,320
You may go now.

563
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,000
You have no idea how bad

564
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:20,920
this wounded soldier's temper is.

565
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,580
He keeps acting up when we try to apply medicine.

566
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:25,200
What?

567
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,200
Let's go.

568
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,960
I shouldn't have let you meet Tang Ju'er.

569
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,360
Do you realize

570
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,920
how dangerous it was

571
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:52,920
to say all those things in there?

572
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,760
You're a dancer,

573
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,600
not a doctor.

574
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,000
Why would a dancer

575
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,720
know so much about medicine?

576
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:56,600
What for?

577
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:57,240
To treat yourself?

578
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,100
That wounded soldier in there...

579
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,120
He's from the airport defense unit,

580
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,640
Private Kaishin Riki.

581
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,720
What's wrong?

582
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:05,640
Do you remember

583
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,240
if I've seen your case files?

584
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,960
The ones sent by the police unit

585
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,960
about General Okaku's plane crash.

586
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,240
General Okaku's

587
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,240
private plane security personnel list

588
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,320
included this man.

589
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:20,620
Are you sure you're not mistaken?

590
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,040
You've witnessed my memory skills before.

591
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:23,840
That's right.

592
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,400
Let's go.

593
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,240
Inoue

594
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,240
Captain.

595
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,480
I got chewed out by Commander Fujita.

596
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,240
It's my fault too.

597
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,320
He's ordered us to solve the case within a week.

598
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,240
Within a week.

599
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,240
Within a week.

600
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:00,600
The Commander ordered us

601
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,260
but which case are we solving?

602
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,840
You're quite the optimist.

603
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,460
We have more cases than we can handle.

604
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,440
Whether it's the Americans on the plane,

605
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:14,480
or the missing garrison soldiers,

606
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,480
or the northern base

607
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,000
that was attacked,

608
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,480
or even last night's case

609
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:27,080
of the Macau gangsters smuggling themselves in.

610
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,000
We need to solve at least one case

611
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,260
to justify ourselves.

612
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,800
What are these gangsters

613
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:40,360
doing on the island again?

614
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,960
Caotang Village.

615
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,800
What Caotang Village?

616
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,159
On the northwestern hillside,

617
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:49,960
there used to be a village.

618
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,080
Do you remember?

619
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,080
I think there was one,

620
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,240
but it's been abandoned for a long time.

621
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,920
The grass there has grown

622
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,250
almost high enough to swallow the houses.

623
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,200
That's not right.

624
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,400
Because that village

625
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,480
has been abandoned for years.

626
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,640
They did search the area

627
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:15,960
but it was just for show.

628
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,960
Let's go check it out now.

629
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,280
Now?

630
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,720
Wait.

631
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,040
Now, Captain Oshima?

632
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,400
Move out.

633
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,080
Let's go.

634
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:01,880
Captain.

635
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,880
This place has been

636
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,240
deserted for years.

637
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,840
Do we still need to search it?

638
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:08,760
Have them line up

639
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,220
and sweep the entire area.

640
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:15,040
Everyone gather up.

641
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,600
Move out.

642
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,400
Attention, everyone!

643
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,360
Last night, the Imperial Army caught two illegal immigrants.

644
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:05,040
They have been executed on the spot.

645
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,520
[Bodies displayed as warning]

646
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,250
To serve as a warning to others.

647
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,540
[Checking]

648
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:43,480
Hurry!

649
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:44,640
Go back quickly.

650
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,120
Report the situation here

651
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,180
to Captain Oshima.

652
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:13,960
Xia'er.

653
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,080
Xie.

654
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,240
Make way.

655
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,080
What are you doing?

656
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,400
Mr. Ye,

657
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,640
what are you doing?

658
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,490
We represent all the villagers of Tanjiawan.

659
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:37,680
We demand that you

660
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,280
release these two children.

661
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,890
On what grounds?

662
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,120
Because they

663
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:46,120
are children from Sanzao Island.

664
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,160
Because

665
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,800
we are all people of Sanzao Island.

666
00:40:58,680 --> 00:40:59,640
Children.

667
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,890
Qingming Festival is coming soon.

668
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,720
I know you've come back

669
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,120
just to visit your loved ones,

670
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,840
sweep their graves and pay respects,

671
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,170
and light some incense.

672
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,520
You've done nothing wrong.

673
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,370
It's not easy to make this journey.

674
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:21,040
I'll take you home now.

675
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,120
Xia'er,

676
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:24,840
untie them.
