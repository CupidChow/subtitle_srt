1
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,240
No one without my permission

2
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,640
dares to enter this room.

3
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,970
I can directly order

4
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:39,100
to shoot them dead.

5
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,360
Anyone.

6
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,380
If you have any doubts,

7
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,320
call right now

8
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,250
and verify with Commander Fujita.

9
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,000
I understand.

10
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,200
I'll verify with the Commander.

11
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,880
Connect me to the Commander.

12
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,400
Speak.

13
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,500
Commander,

14
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,280
this is Oshima.

15
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,050
I'm at the hospital now.

16
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,400
I'm reporting the situation to you.

17
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,920
There are suspicious individuals in the hospital

18
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,050
I want to take them in for questioning.

19
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,000
Now the Major is blocking my way.

20
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,260
Commander,

21
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,220
I need your instructions now.

22
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,570
Is the Colonel with you?

23
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,400
Yes.

24
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,000
Put him on.

25
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,200
Just a moment.

26
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,360
This is Wumu.

27
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,000
Is it about that important witness you mentioned?

28
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,840
Yes.

29
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:09,400
I've already told them.

30
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,400
Anyone who dares to enter this room,

31
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,320
I will shoot them dead.

32
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,120
Let him take the call.

33
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,400
It's me.

34
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,560
Oshima.

35
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,420
Remember this.

36
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,720
The Colonel's key witness,

37
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,520
no matter who they are,

38
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:32,800
regardless of their rank or position,

39
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,840
anyone who attempts to make contact

40
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,040
must be shot on sight.

41
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,400
All hospital matters now

42
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,260
are under the Colonel's command.

43
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:39,960
This nurse

44
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,800
is an important witness related to Inoue Kamakura.

45
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,730
This is an order.

46
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,940
I'll take my leave.

47
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,800
Come back.

48
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,920
Does the Colonel have any other instructions?

49
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,380
The person in this room

50
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,339
has very important information.

51
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,800
To prevent him from leaking it to others,

52
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,760
I specifically found

53
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,960
a Chinese nurse who doesn't understand Japanese

54
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,200
to take care of him.

55
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,520
This is Nurse Tang.

56
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,800
From now on,

57
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,000
you are not allowed to reassign my nurse without permission.

58
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,860
Can you do that?

59
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:38,960
Okay.

60
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,680
I don't believe

61
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,480
that a mere colonel

62
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,400
can control the entire base by himself.

63
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,280
Sasaki.

64
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,080
Gather the base defense unit for me.

65
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,600
Call all

66
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,400
captains involved in the sea ban removal plan

67
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,160
to come here

68
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,120
for a meeting.

69
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:13,690
Yes, sir.

70
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,200
Everyone,

71
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,040
attending this coordination meeting

72
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,000
besides our lead unit,

73
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,460
the Special Police Squad,

74
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,800
we also have the Base Guard Unit,

75
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,930
the Camp Setup Unit,

76
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,960
the Patrol Boat Squad,

77
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,560
the Transport Vessel Squad,

78
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,120
the Coastal Defense Squad,

79
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:56,240
and commanders from the Aviation Squad.

80
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,280
I've gathered all seven units today

81
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,840
for this meeting.

82
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,920
I want to emphasize

83
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,480
that the content of this meeting is strictly confidential.

84
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,560
All unit commanders,

85
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,880
please do not take any written notes.

86
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,560
What's going on?

87
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,720
What's this about?

88
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,280
With the commander's approval,

89
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:32,840
we are preparing to implement the maritime restriction lifting plan.

90
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,090
The mission execution time

91
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,720
is set for 12:30 PM the day after tomorrow,

92
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:41,050
precisely on schedule.

93
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,280
This mission

94
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,480
will be carried out by the Special Police Unit

95
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,640
and the Patrol Boat Unit.

96
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,000
The Guard Unit and the Camp Unit

97
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,800
will be responsible for coastal security.

98
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,690
What are the purpose

99
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:11,240
and key points of this mission?

100
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:17,120
The publicly stated purpose of this mission

101
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,480
is that the Tianchang Festival is approaching,

102
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,920
and for the enjoyment of both military and civilians,

103
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,560
we are lifting the maritime restrictions.

104
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,690
The island's fishermen are permitted

105
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,890
to conduct fishing activities for several days.

106
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,520
Why suddenly lift the maritime ban?

107
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,000
Is there any other purpose?

108
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,960
Yes.

109
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,640
As you all know,

110
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:44,159
over these years,

111
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,440
the troublemakers on the island

112
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:48,000
have caused

113
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,520
more than 40 soldiers from our base

114
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,400
to die unnatural deaths.

115
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,800
This time,

116
00:07:58,159 --> 00:07:59,760
using late April,

117
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,640
the Emperor's birthday occasion,

118
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:11,680
we will use the pretext of lifting the maritime ban

119
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:16,200
to organize

120
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,480
261 young and strong

121
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,010
fishermen to go fishing at sea.

122
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,480
We plan to

123
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,920
eliminate all of them at sea.

124
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:32,559
Eliminate all of them?

125
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,640
Really?

126
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,280
Once we eliminate this group,

127
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,880
the Sixth Air Base

128
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,280
will finally be peaceful.

129
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,240
Will we just blast them with cannons?

130
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,640
We'll use patrol boats to ram and sink them.

131
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:08,920
Will that work?

132
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:11,000
That's good.

133
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,880
We'll use our patrol boats

134
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:22,000
to sink all these fishing boats.

135
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,760
Anyone who falls into the sea,

136
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,480
we'll eliminate them.

137
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,200
The operation area

138
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,120
is nearly 60 nautical miles from our base.

139
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,520
No one can swim back alive.

140
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,120
May I ask

141
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:41,120
a question?

142
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,280
Are there any other key points for this operation?

143
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,480
Our intelligence department in Macao

144
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,880
is actively spreading information there.

145
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,680
They're closely monitoring

146
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:57,360
those gunboats of the Chiang regime

147
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,040
and the movements of those criminal organizations in Macao.

148
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,480
The other two key points

149
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:03,000
of our operation

150
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,640
are to lure these people

151
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,800
out to sea.

152
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,880
Make them think we're off guard.

153
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:14,600
At sea,

154
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,640
they'll believe they can

155
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,240
easily kidnap these people.

156
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:20,560
The speedboat squadron from Da Hengqin Island

157
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,760
will also coordinate with our operation.

158
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,840
Once the boats from Macao come out,

159
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,000
they will block

160
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,200
their retreat route.

161
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,360
As for the specific plan,

162
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:43,280
it was originally for Lieutenant Inoue Kamakura

163
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,240
to lead a patrol boat

164
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:49,120
and follow the fishermen out to sea.

165
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:55,680
Now that Deputy Commander Inoue is dead,

166
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:02,640
I will take over this task.

167
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:09,200
Everyone must remember,

168
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,360
this operation

169
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,200
is only controlled by unit leaders

170
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,060
and not to be communicated to subordinates.

171
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,320
Captain Oshima,

172
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:23,520
will you also join us in this operation?

173
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:26,120
Yes.

174
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,680
I will go with the patrol boat squadron

175
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,640
personnel.

176
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,320
For the specific action plan,

177
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:51,880
please look at this nautical chart.

178
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,680
The special police unit

179
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,000
has begun to arrange

180
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,130
the lifting of the maritime blockade.

181
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,400
The Japanese patrol boat unit on the island

182
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,720
and other departments

183
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,200
also sent representatives to the meeting.

184
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,240
A secret massacre plan

185
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,720
is being quietly implemented.

186
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,880
Meeting adjourned.

187
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,320
Captain,

188
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,160
it's you.

189
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,720
I remember you have

190
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,720
a transport ship

191
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,120
without naval markings.

192
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,600
Yes.

193
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,920
I need to use that ship for a few days.

194
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,000
Will this ship also go out to sea

195
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,320
with the released fishing boats?

196
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:48,880
No.

197
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,400
Not exactly.

198
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,360
I want this ship

199
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,490
to stay at the Macau dock for a few days.

200
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,840
This ship has no naval markings,

201
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:59,610
so it can monitor gang vessels' movements at the Macau dock.

202
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,560
My men aren't good at this sort of thing.

203
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,080
That's not a problem.

204
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,320
Sasaki will arrange for some special police officers

205
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,780
to go along with your ship.

206
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,960
All right then.

207
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,520
Thank you.

208
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:20,360
Sasaki.

209
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,120
Bring Fukuda to me.

210
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,840
On the cliff at our base

211
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,080
are carved the names of more than 40 of our brothers.

212
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,800
I don't want to add any more.

213
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,560
If this plan succeeds,

214
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,480
all problems will be solved.

215
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:59,280
One, two!

216
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,640
Halt!

217
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,400
Left face!

218
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,280
Forward, two steps!

219
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,040
About face!

220
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,480
Salute!

221
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,160
What are you learning here?

222
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:32,920
You've turned my Xiaohong Fist

223
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,040
into Monkey Fist.

224
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,140
You scared me to death.

225
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:37,960
It's all sticky.

226
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,640
Let me wipe it off.

227
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,320
Come.

228
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:40,960
Come here.

229
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,400
I'll teach you a move.

230
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,240
You're willing to teach me now?

231
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,560
I'll teach you a self-defense technique.

232
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:47,240
Got it?

233
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,600
Stand properly.

234
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,480
Stand still.

235
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,400
Grab my clothes.

236
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,180
Use all your strength.

237
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,280
When you encounter someone

238
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,280
bigger and stronger than you.

239
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,880
First, grab his wrist.

240
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,480
Second,

241
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,800
grab his arm.

242
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,680
Two, three, push down.

243
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:07,880
Brother,

244
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,920
I was wrong.

245
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,000
What kind of useless move are you teaching?

246
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,400
Why are you so stupid?

247
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,040
You believe everything you hear.

248
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:14,960
Teaching such useless moves.

249
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,760
Asking me to carry someone.

250
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,280
Go play with your nephew.

251
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:20,800
Alright.

252
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,000
Stop fooling around.

253
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:22,680
You saw her hit me.

254
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,480
Auntie, look at him.

255
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,480
Are you bullying your sister again?

256
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,160
Auntie, she hit me.

257
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,280
Grandma, he's bullying me.

258
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,480
Alright.

259
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,880
Hurry back for dinner.

260
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,040
Let's eat.

261
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:31,840
Come quickly.

262
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,160
Auntie is so biased.

263
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,000
Let's go.

264
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,680
Time to eat.

265
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,120
Let's go.

266
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,720
Attention all villagers!

267
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,450
The day after tomorrow,

268
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,360
those who want to go to sea

269
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:55,320
should go to the ancestral hall to get your sea permits.

270
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,040
Also,

271
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:05,760
Fuda Trading Company will give each boat

272
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,120
a discounted purchase order form.

273
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,720
Did you hear me?

274
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:13,800
Villagers,

275
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,040
attention please!

276
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,640
Go get your fishing permits.

277
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,320
Everyone pay attention!

278
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,690
Time to collect your fishing permits.

279
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,200
Hurry to the ancestral hall now.

280
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,620
Dad, eat your vegetables.

281
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,280
Dad, eat.

282
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,420
You can play with this too?

283
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,839
Is my brother really on that list?

284
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:11,640
He's so stupid.

285
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,560
He doesn't even know how to fish.

286
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,020
What's he going there for?

287
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,599
Yes.

288
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,400
He can't fish.

289
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,660
What would he do there?

290
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,160
It's fine.

291
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,400
Worst case, I just won't go when the time comes.

292
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,200
Sir.

293
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,079
Wu Mu is here.

294
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:30,480
Come.

295
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,680
Mr. Ye.

296
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,010
Sit down and eat with me.

297
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,120
This morning,

298
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,720
Oshima Hiroshi targeted the base hospital.

299
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,640
The Major and Tang Ju'er

300
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:37,840
were almost exposed.

301
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,400
How is the situation now?

302
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,400
Are they alright?

303
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:41,760
I've ordered

304
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:42,920
the anti-aircraft unit

305
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,160
to surround the hospital under the pretext of witness protection.

306
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,880
Tang Ju'er, as his dedicated nurse,

307
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,560
is taking care of the Major privately.

308
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,160
Isn't that too conspicuous?

309
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,720
We can't worry about that during these critical times.

310
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,720
The urgent priority

311
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,480
is to quickly transfer the Major

312
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,400
to Shanghai.

313
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,280
When?

314
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,520
Tomorrow.

315
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:57,840
So soon?

316
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,200
I need to go to Fujita Headquarters now

317
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:00,640
to discuss with him

318
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,280
the arrangements for tomorrow's transfer to Shanghai.

319
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,680
You should get ready too.

320
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,800
Will you have enough time?

321
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:06,660
I'll do my best.

322
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:19,520
Don't push!

323
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,180
There's enough for everyone.

324
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,560
Villagers with fishing permits

325
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,540
after returning from fishing

326
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,920
Fuda Trading Company will

327
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:34,480
purchase according to Nagasaki fish market methods,

328
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,960
allowing price bidding

329
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,200
and auctions.

330
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,600
We'll bid based on

331
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:42,360
the type, size, and quality of the fish.

332
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:43,930
Better quality fish

333
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:45,820
will fetch higher prices.

334
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,200
Quiet down, please.

335
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:50,520
Da Xu, please be quiet.

336
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,520
Gao Erxu is making an announcement.

337
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:56,320
Most of them come from Nagasaki Prefecture.

338
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:01,160
Nagasaki Prefecture has numerous islands and peninsulas.

339
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,640
It has Japan's largest seafood market.

340
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,000
Their favorite fish include marlin,

341
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,200
jack mackerel,

342
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,040
black tuna,

343
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,200
mackerel, hairtail, sea bream,

344
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,560
yellowtail and squid.

345
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,760
After catching mantis shrimp,

346
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,020
don't throw them away.

347
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,640
Mantis shrimp are perfect for miso soup.

348
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,240
Do you understand?

349
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,560
Did you get it?

350
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:27,120
Say something if you understand.

351
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,600
I understand.

352
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,240
Chairman Tang

353
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,360
is here.

354
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,480
It's all yours.

355
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,280
Oh.

356
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,200
Now we'll distribute the fishing permits.

357
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,540
Come forward when you hear your name.

358
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,160
After receiving it, leave your fingerprint.

359
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,290
Without a fingerprint, it's invalid.

360
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,120
You.

361
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,000
Liu Dunfeng.

362
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,800
Come here.

363
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:08,800
An Huijiang.

364
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,920
This...

365
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,800
Hurry up!

366
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,800
Yu Jian.

367
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,040
Yu Jian.

368
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,360
Coming!

369
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,520
Sakamoto.

370
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,600
Hello, Captain Oshima.

371
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,600
Hello, Deputy Captain Sasaki.

372
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,480
Where are you heading to?

373
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,480
Well.

374
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,840
The commander is going to inspect Dahengqin Island,

375
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,600
and asked me and the translator

376
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:57,640
to come to the dock and make arrangements first.

377
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,360
Oh,

378
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,490
so the commander is planning to go out.

379
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:02,520
Are you going out too?

380
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,890
We're just preparing for the plan.

381
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,520
Then I'll go first.

382
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,120
Excuse me.

383
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,160
For this sea voyage,

384
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,640
are you sailing far?

385
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:33,840
Not far,

386
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,500
just about 60 nautical miles.

387
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,880
Then why did you load so much fuel?

388
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,160
These are

389
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:40,520
orders from above.

390
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,400
Okay, thanks.

391
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,360
Has that transport boat

392
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,920
to Macau been dispatched yet?

393
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,640
The crew has been arranged.

394
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,960
They'll depart tonight.

395
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,000
Everyone going to Macau

396
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,600
needs thorough preparation.

397
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,400
Everyone has been instructed.

398
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,120
Should we continue

399
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,920
the investigation of Captain Inoue's case?

400
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,520
The Inoue residence called.

401
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:14,200
People from Section Six will arrive soon.

402
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,480
I understand.

403
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,480
The problem is that colonel.

404
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,600
Finding this man's weakness

405
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:22,000
is extremely difficult.

406
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,240
His weakness

407
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,320
is most likely that woman.

408
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,840
Are you referring to Ye Biying?

409
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,640
That's right.

410
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:33,480
Her brother should be on the list.

411
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,200
If he doesn't return,

412
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:38,090
her family will be in chaos.

413
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:39,960
This is our opportunity.

414
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:42,240
You're truly remarkable.

415
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,040
Captain.

416
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,200
The unit

417
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:55,840
The subordinates

418
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,280
are all ready.

419
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,800
You'll arrive in Shanghai early tomorrow morning.

420
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,840
You'll take the medical transport plane.

421
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,200
Of course,

422
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,800
transporting the wounded is just a cover.

423
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,160
In reality, only you three will be on the plane.

424
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,120
Thank you, General, for your thoughtful arrangements.

425
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,120
This way,

426
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,850
it's both secure and discreet.

427
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,320
Is there anything else

428
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,760
you need me to handle?

429
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,160
Before I leave,

430
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,920
I need to visit the communications room

431
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,880
to report my itinerary

432
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,480
to the Tokyo Imperial Aide-de-Camp's Office.

433
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,580
Someone come here.

434
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:27,480
Escort the Colonel

435
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,080
to the communications room.

436
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:37,480
Be careful with everything.

437
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:51,320
This is a one-time code.

438
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,320
Use it to encode the telegram.

439
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,040
Yes, sir.

440
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,880
Plan to fly to Shanghai tomorrow morning.

441
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,800
The important prisoner will be

442
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,240
transferred to Shanghai garrison's custody

443
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,920
for further investigation.

444
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,480
Please inform the Shanghai garrison

445
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,880
to arrange personnel and vehicles for airport pickup.

446
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,480
Takekichiro Muki.

447
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,360
Takekichiro Muki.

448
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,520
Tomorrow at noon,

449
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:29,450
the messenger will arrive at Shanghai Jiangwan Airport under escort.

450
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,200
Report,

451
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,000
urgent telegram from the envoy.

452
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,120
Is anything missing from the translation?

453
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:44,800
Sir,

454
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,330
it's completely accurate.

455
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,040
Send an encrypted message immediately

456
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,500
to Li Baoshan in Shanghai.

457
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,760
Tell Li Baoshan to bring people

458
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,800
to Jiangwan Airport.

459
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,840
Lumberjack,

460
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,080
I hope you return safely.

461
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,320
Colonel.

462
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,480
Good work.

463
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,340
Captain Akino,

464
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,420
has anyone entered this room?

465
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,120
No.

466
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,160
I'm going in now

467
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,560
to have a word with him.

468
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:48,880
Stay here and keep watch.

469
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,080
Don't let anyone in.

470
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,200
Don't worry.

471
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,520
Tomorrow morning's flight,

472
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,600
I'll take you away from this island.

473
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,640
Is it safe?

474
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,240
This may not be the best plan,

475
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,250
but it's our best option right now.

476
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,760
Okay.

477
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,160
Weit.

478
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,160
Your mission

479
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,240
is backed by an American

480
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,240
military operation,

481
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,080
isn't it?

482
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,360
You knew I would ask you sooner or later.

483
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,560
America is planning to bomb Tokyo,

484
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,480
isn't it?

485
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:57,160
Your mission is

486
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:59,480
to provide support for those bombing planes,

487
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,320
right?

488
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,680
Tokyo is so big.

489
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,170
Are there specific areas and targets?

490
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,200
I'll come pick you up tomorrow morning.

491
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,970
Let me emphasize again.

492
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,360
No one is allowed to enter this room,

493
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:52,220
especially members of the Special Police Unit.

494
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,580
If they attempt to force their way in,

495
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,000
shoot to kill.

496
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:09,720
Army 08596

497
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,880
Why aren't you eating, Yingying?

498
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,360
Look, your mother-in-law has cooked so many

499
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,800
of your favorite dishes.

500
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,240
Rice noodle rolls, meat patties,

501
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,520
and clay pot rice.

502
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,680
Eat more.

503
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,520
Later, even if you

504
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:29,480
want to eat these, you won't be able to.

505
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:31,240
Mother,

506
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,480
what are you saying?

507
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:34,840
I'll be back soon.

508
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,480
I'll be able to eat your cooking then.

509
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,040
Don't come back.

510
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,920
Don't come back under any circumstances.

511
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,160
As long as the Japanese remain on Sanzao Island,

512
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,680
don't you dare return.

513
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,920
Remember that.

514
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,160
Mother.

515
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,800
This is my home.

516
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,960
How could I not come back?

517
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:52,720
That's enough, stop talking.

518
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,780
Don't say anymore.

519
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:54,720
Besides,

520
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:55,850
she can't leave now.

521
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,240
Mother.

522
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,220
There are many delicious foods outside too.

523
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:02,280
Ying'er.

524
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,760
When you're out there,

525
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,000
and I'm not by your side...

526
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,660
Wu Mu will take care of you now.

527
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:09,480
Wu Mu.

528
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,260
Let me toast you first.

529
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:27,760
Mr. Ye.

530
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,360
Mrs. Si.

531
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,240
Longxia.

532
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,240
Please allow me to toast you all.

533
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,320
If it weren't for

534
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,640
your family,

535
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,760
I wouldn't have found the Major so quickly

536
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,290
or completed this mission.

537
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,160
Please rest assured, Mr. Ye.

538
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,760
After I escort the Major out,

539
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,640
I will definitely investigate

540
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:48,500
the lifting of the maritime ban for you thoroughly.

541
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,080
Wumu.

542
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,560
Right now,

543
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,560
your only concern

544
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,450
should be protecting yourselves,

545
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,080
keeping the Major safe,

546
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,560
and leaving this island safely.

547
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,640
Don't worry about matters on the island.

548
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,360
The islanders will handle things themselves.

549
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,080
All right.

550
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:25,200
Father.

551
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:28,000
Lifting the maritime ban is extremely important.

552
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,400
Once we complete our mission,

553
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,730
we'll definitely find a way to resolve it.

554
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,240
You now carry

555
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,370
a critical mission on your shoulders.

556
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,250
Take care of the immediate matters first.

557
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,120
I hope

558
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,000
that you and Wumu can

559
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,360
leave here safely.

560
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,240
Okay?

561
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,200
Wumu.

562
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,600
I'm entrusting Ying'er to you.

563
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:11,800
Wumu,

564
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,600
let me toast you again.

565
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,720
Our relationship

566
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,880
needs no words.

567
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,140
It's all in this drink.

568
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,320
Why me again?

569
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,320
Bottoms up!

570
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,580
Ye Longxia, the Tiger Down the Mountain.

571
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,040
Come eat.

572
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,720
I need some fresh air.

573
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,760
Yingying.

574
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,280
Let's eat.

575
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,450
Translator Luo,

576
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,530
why are you here?

577
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,760
I'm feeling down.

578
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,480
Colonel Wumu is here too.

579
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:24,960
Yes.

580
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:28,080
Actually that day...

581
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,650
I heard you're leaving.

582
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:35,170
How did you know?

583
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,760
I accidentally

584
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,360
overheard Commander Fujita talking about it.

585
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,160
Is there something you need?

586
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,160
Nothing really.

587
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,760
I just came to say goodbye.

588
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:53,240
Actually,

589
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:55,240
I don't dislike you.

590
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,940
I don't think you're a bad person either.

591
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:58,920
It's just that on certain

592
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,720
major issues of right and wrong,

593
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:03,560
our positions and viewpoints differ, that's all.

594
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:05,200
What you said to me that day,

595
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,600
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

596
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,640
Living in chaotic times,

597
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,400
we're just trying to survive on our own.

598
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,640
Anyway,

599
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,800
I wish you a safe journey

600
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,760
and good luck.

601
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,240
Thank you.

602
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:23,640
No need to thank me.

603
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,160
It's good you're leaving now,

604
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,480
to avoid more trouble.

605
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,480
What do you mean by that?

606
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,280
Nothing special.

607
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:36,720
I just mean

608
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,450
it's right for you to leave now.

609
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,780
Do you know something?

610
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,240
They might be planning to kill someone.

611
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,360
I'll join you.

612
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:57,480
Here, Dad.

613
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:58,740
Let me fill your glass.

614
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,480
Wumu.

615
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,080
When I'm not around,

616
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:05,610
you must take good care of my sister out there.

617
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,600
Don't you dare bully her.

618
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:08,880
Let me tell you,

619
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,139
I'm quite formidable.

620
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,199
I've practiced martial arts since childhood.

621
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:13,530
If you dare to bully her,

622
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:14,600
I won't let you off the hook.

623
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,480
Listen, forget about me bullying her.

624
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,480
I'd be lucky if she doesn't bully me.

625
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:25,620
Have something to eat.

626
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,340
I brought all your favorite food.

627
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,639
When I'm gone, my sister will depend entirely on you.

628
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:33,520
Eat up.

629
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,320
Don't you dare bully her.

630
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,480
Let me tell you.

631
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:39,159
I'm actually quite formidable,

632
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:40,600
not like that night.

633
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,159
This morning,

634
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,000
I saw the police squad

635
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:53,659
loading lots of gasoline onto patrol boats.

636
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,679
But the sea journey

637
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,120
is only 60 nautical miles.

638
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,180
They don't need that much fuel at all.

639
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,520
I'm not sure

640
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:02,200
what this means,

641
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,040
but it doesn't feel right.

642
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:05,880
I'm worried

643
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,040
something terrible will happen

644
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:10,080
to those 260 people going to sea.

645
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:14,600
I also saw them loading

646
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,540
many boxes of explosives onto the patrol boats.

647
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,520
This deep-sea fishing is a conspiracy.

648
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,800
I must stay and save these villagers.

649
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,040
Mother,

650
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:19,720
I'm leaving.

651
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,360
I'm sorry,

652
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,200
Mother.

653
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:25,600
While parents are alive,

654
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,060
one should not travel far.

655
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,080
I have failed to follow this.

656
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,860
Travel must have purpose.

657
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:51,960
Please rest assured.

658
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,600
I will never forget.

659
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:58,480
That in my body

660
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,800
flows Chinese blood.

661
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:06,800
Please promise me

662
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,300
to wait until I'm gone before you cry.

663
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,200
You've been by my side for so many years.

664
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:28,720
I'm already very content.

665
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:30,640
Now

666
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,940
is the time for you to serve your country.

667
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:39,320
Don't forget you're Chinese.

668
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,480
Go.

669
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,080
What are you thinking about?

670
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:32,940
Thinking about my mother.

671
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:34,720
She's beautiful.

672
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,320
I suppose

673
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,480
she must be a kind

674
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:39,640
and great person.

675
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:45,490
The Americans are going to bomb Tokyo.

676
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:48,360
Then,

677
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,120
your mother...

678
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,800
You should quickly notify your contacts in Japan

679
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:54,880
to get your mother out of there.

680
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:55,880
I can't do that.

681
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:00,120
This is top secret information.

682
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,020
Acting rashly would be too risky.

683
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,380
Remember this.

684
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:05,800
This matter

685
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:07,200
stays between you and me.

686
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,240
Don't tell anyone else.

687
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,680
Can't we do anything?
