1
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,160
Hello. Hello.

2
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,200
A telegram.

3
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,600
It's a telegram.

4
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,479
Send me a telegram immediately.

5
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:55,479
and tell Commander Yuan

6
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:57,320
Tell them I’ll go today.

7
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,120
to go to Mount Huangyang.

8
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,240
to meet me in the seventh team.

9
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:14,920
Come on.

10
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,400
Come here.

11
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,720
Come on. Come on.

12
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,480
Folks,

13
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,240
Let me read it to you.

14
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,680
This notice

15
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,600
To celebrate the Emperor's birthday

16
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,040
the police force

17
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,200
The sea ban will be lifted soon.

18
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,640
and allows young men to go fishing in the sea.

19
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:42,120
and agreed to

20
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:46,079
at the beginning of April.

21
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:47,520
It's been four years.

22
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,280
Is it true that the sea ban is suddenly lifted?

23
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:49,880
Really?

24
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,400
Of course.

25
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,360
It's a good thing.

26
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,400
Really.

27
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,560
Listen.

28
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,200
Quiet.

29
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,480
Be quiet.

30
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,680
Everyone

31
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,800
Now

32
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,080
Put the thing in your hand

33
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:07,000
in your hands.

34
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,880
What about going home?

35
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,010
Repairing the ship.

36
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,160
Weave the net.

37
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,240
Prepare for sailing.

38
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,120
Okay?

39
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,480
Okay.

40
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,610
Go back and prepare.

41
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,160
Then hurry up and get ready.

42
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,560
Oh my god!

43
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,640
Let's go!

44
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,880
Let's go.

45
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,400
Attention, everyone.

46
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,480
Fix the fishing boat.

47
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,400
Fix the fishing net.

48
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,460
and wait for the notice of departure.

49
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,920
Is Mr. Ye home?

50
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,530
Who is it?

51
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:40,880
Hello. Hello.

52
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,520
Are you looking for Master?

53
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,760
What's the matter?

54
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,680
The sea ban is lifted.

55
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,840
I'm here to tell Lord De.

56
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,960
What are they doing here?

57
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,480
Mr Fukuda is here

58
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,680
to count the names of the sailors.

59
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,320
In the future,

60
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,400
the fish

61
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:02,000
Mr Fukuda bought them all.

62
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:04,800
Wait for me.

63
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,080
I'll go tell Master.

64
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,880
Not here.

65
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:15,960
Go away!

66
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,200
Mr Fukuda

67
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,960
I know

68
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,250
of the Ye family.

69
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,680
They only have

70
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,480
a young man.

71
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,480
Just write him down.

72
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,560
Hurry up.

73
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,240
Let's go to the next one to count.

74
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:44,840
Okay.

75
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,560
Li.

76
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,480
Take him there.

77
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,400
Alas.

78
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:52,720
Let's go.

79
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,960
I'll explain

80
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,000
to Master Ye.

81
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:57,159
You go first.

82
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,200
Let's go.

83
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,760
Bingchen.

84
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,200
Lord De.

85
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,600
What's the matter?

86
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,940
The Japanese want to lift the sea ban.

87
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:16,920
Lord De.

88
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,640
The Japanese on the island

89
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:21,000
are secretly investigating

90
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,520
Who keeps pigeons?

91
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,920
Where did the pigeon come from?

92
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,320
The Japanese are haunted.

93
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,400
It's better to be careful.

94
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,920
This is...

95
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,040
to lift the sea ban.

96
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,560
Okay, go ahead.

97
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,200
See you.

98
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,040
What is this corn?

99
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,800
I ate it myself.

100
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,400
Don't you have pigeons at home?

101
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:36,720
Look.

102
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,850
Do you have pigeons?

103
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,520
No.

104
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,780
No one raises pigeons.

105
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:46,800
Who has pigeons in this village?

106
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,720
Who knows?

107
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,659
There's no one here. Let's go.

108
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,880
Let's go.

109
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,530
You wanted to see me?

110
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,600
Mr. Tang said

111
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,960
the Japanese have agreed

112
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,160
to sail.

113
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:10,840
I was looking for you.

114
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,760
to talk about this.

115
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,640
I saw the notice

116
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,640
at the entrance of the village.

117
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,760
The villagers are talking about it too.

118
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,880
What do you think?

119
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,960
Should we take this opportunity

120
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:21,360
to transfer the Major

121
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,480
and ask your uncle

122
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,480
in Macau.

123
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,000
Should we send a message

124
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
to Uncle?

125
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,760
Actually, Tang Bingchen told me today

126
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,800
the Japanese

127
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,090
are investigating the pigeon.

128
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,480
No wonder.

129
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,520
I just passed the village entrance

130
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,640
I saw the Japanese asking questions.

131
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:43,120
Luckily they didn't suspect our family now.

132
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,159
But in the future,

133
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,000
we have to be careful.

134
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,080
Okay.

135
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,080
What about Major?

136
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,960
We'll make a plan.

137
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,720
Before things are clear,

138
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,880
don't tell your uncle yet.

139
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,480
Let me think about it.

140
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,760
Sir.

141
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,720
Pack up now.

142
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,480
Let's go back to Zhongshan now.

143
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,360
Yes.

144
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,360
Habha.

145
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,960
The men sent to report to me.

146
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,880
This morning,...

147
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,040
The master of Anlan Hall summoned...

148
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,560
...to discuss with all the chiefs.

149
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,160
They haven't come out yet.

150
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,760
Anlan Clinic is very active.

151
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:11,920
Do you know what they are discussing?

152
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,520
Because we haven't

153
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,240
infiltrated into their body,

154
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,560
I'm not sure yet.

155
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:18,640
A few days ago,

156
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,760
...who appeared in Anlan Hall...

157
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,280
Are you clear?

158
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,360
According to my initial understanding,

159
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,200
in Anlan Clinic,

160
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,920
in Anlan Hall.

161
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,280
led

162
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,280
a dozen guards in black.

163
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,320
in black.

164
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,320
Who is he?

165
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,480
Probably from the mainland.

166
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,380
Maybe it has something to do with the Jiang government.

167
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,480
I guess

168
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,640
Spies are not allowed

169
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,880
such words.

170
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,360
I’ll check it now.

171
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:55,320
Oshima Hao from Airlines 6

172
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,240
He's very strong.

173
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,680
He won't ask us for help

174
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,960
they won't ask for help.

175
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,400
Can't you think of a way...

176
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,720
in Anlan Hall?

177
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,240
We have a candidate.

178
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,680
to report to you.

179
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,280
You should have told me earlier.

180
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,320
Who is he?

181
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,520
His name is Rat.

182
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,640
He was the most famous master

183
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:26,970
in the cliff area eight.

184
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:28,520
Not only is he black,

185
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,800
but also black-hearted.

186
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,640
After we occupied Zone 8,

187
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,720
he turned to

188
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,200
Yuanyuan led a triplet team.

189
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,200
He's good at shooting.

190
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,640
But he couldn't stand it.

191
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,970
He was very restrained.

192
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,800
to Macau.

193
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,640
Ye Zhao Geng saved him.

194
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,520
He's at Anlan Hall now.

195
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:47,920
Continue.

196
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,960
Ye ZhaoGeng read his marksmanship

197
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,600
He's useful.

198
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,480
So I gave him

199
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,520
the boss of the helm.

200
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,240
Now...

201
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,520
to manage Anlan Hall.

202
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,380
...the fishing boat and the dock.

203
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,480
So,

204
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,160
this person is in danger.

205
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,040
Is he loyal to Anlan Hall?

206
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:11,160
Ye ZhaoGeng loves him very much.

207
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,200
And he only listens to

208
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,960
Ye ZhaoGeng's order.

209
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,080
Why do you think

210
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,640
we can fight for him?

211
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,960
Although he's loyal,

212
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,880
but he smokes opium.

213
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,480
And he likes women.

214
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,880
and gambles a lot.

215
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,640
I still owe Yongri Casino.

216
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,480
200,000 won gambling debt.

217
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,560
has a lot of weaknesses.

218
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:32,920
Yeah.

219
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,600
Good.

220
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,000
Take the action team.

221
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,000
Keep a close eye on them.

222
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:42,400
Anlan Hall and General's Macau Station.

223
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,720
Yes.

224
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,320
And...

225
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,120
Go to Yongri Casino right now.

226
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,800
and collect all the gambling debts

227
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,240
to us.

228
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,160
Take him down.

229
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,680
Yes.

230
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,320
Who's in charge of this room?

231
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,480
Dr. Jin.

232
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,080
Okay.

233
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,640
Go out and watch.

234
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,000
Let me talk to him.

235
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:08,840
Will.

236
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:11,720
Will.

237
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,400
Don't move.

238
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,480
Feeling better?

239
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,720
Much better.

240
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,000
I got the news.

241
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,280
the second believer

242
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,810
fell off the plane and died.

243
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,420
Tomorrow we will have a chance

244
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,480
to leave Sanbu Island tomorrow.

245
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:49,760
I was going to take you with me.

246
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,480
But your body...

247
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,280
If you act rashly,

248
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:55,640
more dangerous.

249
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,160
So I think

250
00:13:58,160 --> 00:13:59,720
send out the information first.

251
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,160
When you get better,

252
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:01,680
I'll find a way

253
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,280
to leave the island with you.

254
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,400
How?

255
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,240
I'll make an excuse to investigate.

256
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,240
the scene of the Daegu Dropping.

257
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,560
Go to Mount Hwangyang.

258
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:17,960
Our men will

259
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:18,920
in advance.

260
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:21,000
there will be a battle between them.

261
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:21,840
I'll take the chance

262
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,840
in the chaos.

263
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:40,360
It's on page 24 to page 34.

264
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:54,680
Send it out safely.

265
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:58,160
Send it to the San State Airport.

266
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,040
But you have to promise me one thing.

267
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,280
If anything happens,

268
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,640
you must detonate it immediately.

269
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,040
I promise you.

270
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,480
Don't worry that I'll leave with it.

271
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,610
I'm not coming back.

272
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,040
See you later.

273
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,240
Who's in charge?

274
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,080
Habha.

275
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:58,880
It's me.

276
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,240
I need a doctor.

277
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:02,000
Come with me tomorrow.

278
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,160
to carry out a mission.

279
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:03,880
We have received

280
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:04,920
the command center.

281
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,250
I'm arranging a doctor.

282
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,080
Who's Dr. Jin?

283
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,480
It's me.

284
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,360
We met before.

285
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:12,920
Yes.

286
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,600
Okay.

287
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,920
Let him be.

288
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,080
Yes, sir.

289
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,520
Let's send Dr. Otsutsumi.

290
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,320
Tomorrow morning,

291
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,840
report to the airport garrison tomorrow morning.

292
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:20,720
Yes.

293
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,280
Dr. Kozumi is not bad.

294
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,920
You're chosen by the colonel.

295
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,320
But if you leave, your patient

296
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:32,880
Especially

297
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,010
What about the second-class soldier?

298
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,880
Just a few days.

299
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:37,680
I'll ask Nurse Tang

300
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,800
to take care of her.

301
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,640
Okay.

302
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:40,760
Go ahead.

303
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,780
Let's talk inside.

304
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,480
Use your memory

305
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,480
to page 24 to page 34

306
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,360
from page 24 to page 34.

307
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,600
Be accurate.

308
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,960
In every line,

309
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,080
every word.

310
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,560
What is this for?

311
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,120
I saw it.

312
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,400
There seems to be

313
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,280
in the top nine.

314
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,520
The last page is hidden

315
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,320
code and number.

316
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,720
Remember the operation tomorrow.

317
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,200
If I make any mistake,

318
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,280
all the information

319
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,280
with your head.

320
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,800
You just said

321
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,160
if you make any mistake,

322
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,160
What do you mean?

323
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,960
I mean just in case.

324
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,410
I don't want that to happen.

325
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,640
I want you to be safe.

326
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,040
I hope I'm okay too.

327
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,760
I promise you.

328
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,170
I'll try my best to protect myself.

329
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,120
and complete the mission.

330
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,520
and come back soon.

331
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,640
But I have to say it again.

332
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:26,960
What if

333
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,560
I make any mistake tomorrow,

334
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:29,560
Remember.

335
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,240
Do everything you can

336
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,200
to hand the information

337
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,120
to the person you think is safe.

338
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,580
and complete our mission.

339
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,040
Can you do it?

340
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,160
You have to.

341
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,840
You have a afternoon and a night.

342
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,600
I'm going to the arsenal squadron

343
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,000
to arrange for tomorrow.

344
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,680
I'll get the Bible before the operation.

345
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,840
Damn it!

346
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,800
Ichiro Takemichi-kun!

347
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,960
He's going too far.

348
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,080
Captain.

349
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,280
If I were there,

350
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,280
I would hold my gun.

351
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,160
the woman and Kewen's mouth.

352
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:24,480
He's still quibbling.

353
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:24,640
Captain.

354
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,280
Captain.

355
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,760
The opponent is stronger than we thought.

356
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,560
And his public identity

357
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,800
is the biggest obstacle

358
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,080
our biggest obstacle.

359
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:34,160
Report!

360
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,280
Sir.

361
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,080
Call from Macau.

362
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,240
You may leave.

363
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,120
Macau Special Class.

364
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,480
from Macao.

365
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:50,800
A group of mysterious people

366
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,120
in Macau.

367
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,480
They went to Anlan Hall.

368
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,810
They're very imposing.

369
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:59,480
The leader has more than ten guards.

370
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,400
Are they related

371
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,560
with our base?

372
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:04,480
They seem to be the Commander.

373
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,760
But they suddenly disappeared today.

374
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,020
They seem to have returned to Zhongshan.

375
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,880
Captain.

376
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,160
I think these people...

377
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,760
must have something to do with those two...

378
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,840
who smuggled into the island.

379
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,480
Why did they go back to Zhongshan?

380
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,400
Sasaki.

381
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,160
Check the base operation course.

382
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:25,960
What are we doing

383
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:27,080
in Zhongshan?

384
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:35,200
Tomorrow morning,

385
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,080
we'll take the patrol boat.

386
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,000
through the secret door

387
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,320
Finally,

388
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,320
we arrived near the Red Canal.

389
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,920
Log from here

390
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,200
and walk to

391
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,400
where Huang Yang Shan fell off.

392
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,760
Commander Fujita

393
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:51,480
specially prepared a radio station

394
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,640
for this operation.

395
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:53,920
A reporter

396
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,920
and a doctor with the team.

397
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:56,480
I hope

398
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,680
be fully prepared.

399
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,320
One more thing.

400
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,080
I have to emphasize that

401
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,560
before the operation,

402
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,200
don't tell anyone

403
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,480
about this operation

404
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,680
any participants.

405
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:07,560
The time to deliver the order is

406
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,360
After boarding tomorrow morning,

407
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,420
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

408
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:12,720
Yes.

409
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:13,880
Dismissed.

410
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:23,600
Colonel.

411
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,240
Thank you very much

412
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,000
for your trust in us.

413
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,280
My squadron

414
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,880
From Taiwan to Airlines 6,

415
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:41,840
we have never left

416
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,120
this island.

417
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,400
Thank you very much

418
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,480
for giving us this chance.

419
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,080
I can see that

420
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:49,920
After the mission,

421
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,380
The officers are excited.

422
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,640
You may be tired tomorrow.

423
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,800
The landslide is on the hill.

424
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,480
There's a difficult mountain road to go.

425
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,240
So prepare more

426
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,480
to open the way.

427
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,120
Yes.

428
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,000
I'll ask them to get ready.

429
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,480
Once they arrive at the crash scene,

430
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,160
Set up security guards around.

431
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,640
We'll do the survey.

432
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,640
So the tools for survey

433
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:09,040
are ready.

434
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,800
How long

435
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,400
fall off the plane?

436
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,240
According to my plan,

437
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,480
Just one day.

438
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,480
in one night.

439
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,760
I'll tell them.

440
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,580
Akino-san, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

441
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,160
Thank you.

442
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:02,160
I saw the ink on the gloves.

443
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,840
Takemichi realized that

444
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,400
the police force

445
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,160
and chased him.

446
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,720
Even the gentle Fujita

447
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,880
is acting in secret.

448
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,680
But for Fujita,

449
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,600
he's more afraid of

450
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,280
he's more afraid of the envoy from the palace.

451
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:21,880
the investigation of Horn's death

452
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,360
will bring

453
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,840
an unpredictable trouble.

454
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,240
Where do you think

455
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,040
hide now?

456
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:38,360
I don't know where he's hiding.

457
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,320
Please.

458
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:40,880
Thank you.

459
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,480
But

460
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,800
It's very obvious that

461
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,680
this American

462
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:53,800
is right under our nose.

463
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,800
but we can't catch him.

464
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:00,800
If that ship...

465
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,200
that smuggled from Macau

466
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,880
We're here to pick up the Americans who landed.

467
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,040
After this operation fails,

468
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,560
they will definitely

469
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,720
another operation.

470
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,000
Besides,

471
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,080
this kind of action is very urgent.

472
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:17,520
Captain.

473
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,400
You mean...

474
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,080
the commanders in Macau

475
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,000
is related to

476
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:26,600
on our island.

477
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,520
I don't know yet.

478
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:32,980
Lee.

479
00:25:35,920 --> 00:25:37,040
Looks like

480
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,200
there's a very close

481
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,040
between the island

482
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,480
to contact.

483
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,200
Colonel.

484
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:13,360
Mount Huangyang is right ahead.

485
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,850
Get ready to ashore.

486
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,800
Notify everyone.

487
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:27,040
Get ready to ashore.

488
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,480
Have you been here before?

489
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,640
Yes.

490
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,000
Are you familiar with the terrain?

491
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,200
Yes.

492
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,720
Are you all local?

493
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,480
Yes.

494
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,040
Commander Yuan.

495
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,160
Wait.

496
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,080
Let them ambush

497
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,080
in this position.

498
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,400
Let the devil in.

499
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,480
When the devil comes in,

500
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,560
I have a request.

501
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,800
I don't want to annihilate them.

502
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,480
We just need to disperse them.

503
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,280
Disperse!

504
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,930
Commissioner Shen.

505
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,880
The devil's firepower

506
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,400
is much better than us.

507
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,130
What if we can't get rid of them?

508
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,120
I don't know

509
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,250
I don't know how many demons will come.

510
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,800
Anyway, the more people

511
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,840
The more, the better.

512
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,520
We must overwhelm them.

513
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,800
How many people can we transfer?

514
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,480
How many?

515
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,000
The seventh temporary team.

516
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,680
The Communist Party unit I mentioned.

517
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,880
Should we transfer them too?

518
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,640
Forget it.

519
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,880
This is a secret operation.

520
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,320
Don't let them participate.

521
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,240
Except them,

522
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,120
besides them?

523
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,400
Apart from the seventh squadron,

524
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,400
five or six teams have arrived.

525
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,400
The fourth and eighth team

526
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,560
On the way,

527
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:41,930
We'll be there soon.

528
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:42,680
How many people?

529
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:43,320
Don't worry.

530
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:45,650
There will be hundreds of people missing.

531
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,480
Hurry up and decorate.

532
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,890
I'll check the terrain.

533
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,760
Okay.

534
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,360
Excuse me.

535
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,320
I asked the base operation class.

536
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,320
At nine this morning,

537
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,120
Colonel Takemuki led some people

538
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,480
to Huangyang Mountain.

539
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,720
We'll check the scene

540
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,880
and measure.

541
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,480
Wait, wait, wait.

542
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,560
Are you kidding me?

543
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:20,240
Sasaki.

544
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,560
Does Commander Fujita know about this?

545
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:23,160
The commander approved it.

546
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,020
It’s approved.

547
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:28,320
What a coincidence.

548
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:30,600
The commander

549
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,080
from Macau to Zhongshan.

550
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,640
Our envoy

551
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,300
to Zhongshan from the island.

552
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,480
Captain.

553
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:41,640
What should we do?

554
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:55,120
What are they doing there?

555
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,200
Could it be...

556
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:06,000
we're going to Mount Huangyang too?

557
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,060
A mantis catches a cicada.

558
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,800
The yellow sparrow is behind.

559
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:15,800
That's right.

560
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,640
We are Yellow Sparrow.

561
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:20,960
Understood.

562
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,840
Sasaki.

563
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:25,840
Yes.

564
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,080
One more thing.

565
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,480
Got it.

566
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,680
What are they doing there?

567
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,280
Report!

568
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,360
Sir.

569
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,090
The crash scene is right ahead.

570
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:35,840
Okay.

571
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:48,920
How is it?

572
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:49,760
Sir.

573
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,760
It's almost done.

574
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,120
There.

575
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,320
One more machine gun.

576
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,090
Set up another team over there.

577
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,010
Commissioner Shen.

578
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,140
That is the landfall of the plane.

579
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,920
Is it the only way

580
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,600
Is that the only way?

581
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,200
Yes.

582
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,560
Go into the valley.

583
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,760
to enter this valley.

584
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:26,560
Pass my order.

585
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:29,020
After the Japanese enter the encirclement,

586
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,920
our men can only kill Japanese soldiers.

587
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:34,080
Don't shoot Japanese officers.

588
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,560
or stab.

589
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,960
Pick Japanese soldiers.

590
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,610
Don’t kill Japanese officers.

591
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,160
How do I fight this battle?

592
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,480
Just send my order.

593
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,480
Pass my order.

594
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,840
When the Japanese enter the encirclement,

595
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,240
only kill soldiers.

596
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,680
Don't kill Japanese officers.

597
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,640
Don’t use a knife.

598
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,880
to kill Japanese officers.

599
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,210
We must catch him alive.

600
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,850
Commissioner Shen.

601
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,080
Why can't we kill the devil officer?

602
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,080
Report!

603
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,320
Habha!

604
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,040
We're here.

605
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,080
It's right ahead.

606
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,520
Okay.

607
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:00,680
Come on.

608
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:05,650
Do you want to fight?

609
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:06,360
Stop it.

610
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:06,840
Hold it.

611
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,880
Let them in.

612
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,320
Thank you.

613
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,320
We're finally here.

614
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,400
Thank you.

615
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,160
A year has passed.

616
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,480
there is still no grass here.

617
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,880
It shows how big the fire was

618
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,840
when the plane fell here.

619
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,480
It is said that on the day of the fall last year,

620
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,400
the fire in Mount Huangyang

621
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,560
has been on fire for almost a day.

622
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,000
There's a big green tree on this hill.

623
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:13,880
were burned

624
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,280
in this disaster.

625
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,760
It's been burning for so long.

626
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,480
The fall

627
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:27,199
was even worse.

628
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:29,280
Nine people died.

629
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,040
Two generals.

630
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:32,960
If I didn't see

631
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:34,159
the crash scene,

632
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,480
I wouldn’t feel like this.

633
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:41,639
Colonel.

634
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:42,560
Hide!

635
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,400
Who shot?

636
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,480
The military will punish those who shoot without permission.

637
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,520
Who shot?

638
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,280
Don't shoot without my order.

639
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,199
All units.

640
00:34:51,199 --> 00:34:52,239
Prepare to fight!

641
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,960
Villains are nearby!

642
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,080
Hide!

643
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:04,760
Yuan.

644
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,800
Don't shoot!

645
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,120
That's the top soldier of the devil.

646
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,520
to explore the way.

647
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,840
Jiang's army is ahead.

648
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,640
Protect Colonel!

649
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,000
Wang Jia.

650
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,320
Bring me some men.

651
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,580
Good shooting skills.

652
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,600
Bring that Japanese officer

653
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,480
the Japanese officer

654
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,600
by the side.

655
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,560
Take cover.

656
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,560
Charge!

657
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,320
Go! Go! Go!

658
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,760
Guys!

659
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,320
Go!

660
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,880
Go!

661
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:28,600
Go! Go! Go! Go!

662
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,480
Kill them!

663
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,120
Go!

664
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:44,320
Go! Go! Go!

665
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:11,260
Protect the radio.

666
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,760
Don't fall into the enemy's hands.

667
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,760
Yes.

668
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,600
I know.

669
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,120
Keep going.

670
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:01,640
we can meet Commissioner Shen.

671
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,160
At least

672
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:05,680
two minutes for them.

673
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:07,680
With this time,

674
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,040
is enough.

675
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,520
Watch out!

676
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:36,800
At this moment,

677
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,160
Takemichi knows

678
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:39,320
This mission

679
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,560
When the gunshot

680
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,760
when the gun rang,

681
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:44,080
he failed.

682
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,000
He must have some measures

683
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,680
to clear Oshima Ho's suspicion.

684
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,160
Captain.

685
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,480
Captain.

686
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,720
Let's go. Let's go.

687
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:00,920
Let's go.

688
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,600
Colonel.

689
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
Go after him!

690
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,320
Run!

691
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,920
Go!

692
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,000
Go after them!

693
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,480
Hurry!
