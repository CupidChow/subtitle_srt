1
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,440
Let's go! Let's go!

2
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,200
Hurry up!

3
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,600
The one who did skydiving

4
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,680
The higher-ups are very satisfied with the recent work.

5
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,240
Keep up the good work.

6
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,170
Don't slack off.

7
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,360
The next mission is

8
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,280
Sir.

9
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,940
We caught a skydiving person.

10
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,200
This is very urgent.

11
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,970
Many lives are at stake.

12
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,880
I have to rush to the Qizhou Airport immediately.

13
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,280
Miss.

14
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:08,800
Wait a minute.

15
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:10,200
Our officer is on his way.

16
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,400
I told you it's urgent.

17
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,130
I can't wait.

18
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,600
If you can't solve it, I'll kill you all! I'll kill you!

19
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,530
This is an order.

20
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,200
Please don't make it difficult for us.

21
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,200
I told you many lives are on the line.

22
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,260
Do you understand?

23
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,329
What's going on?

24
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,650
You're the top leader here.

25
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,220
Tell me who you are.

26
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,560
My name is Ye Bi-ying.

27
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,000
I'm asking your real name.

28
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:35,730
and your job.

29
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,320
This is the number of the Supreme Military Agency.

30
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,680
You can verify my identity

31
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,210
you can verify my identity.

32
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,360
Go.

33
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,040
Let's go. Let's go. Okay.

34
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:50,570
Yes, sir.

35
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,960
Also, hurry up and search.

36
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,320
A man named Ichiro Takemichi.

37
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,320
He's seriously injured.

38
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,120
He's one of us.

39
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,079
Then send someone

40
00:03:57,079 --> 00:03:58,400
to send me to San Zhou Airport.

41
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,360
I have very important information

42
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,120
to deliver.

43
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,640
It's not up to you.

44
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,890
Check your identity first.

45
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,600
I'm warning you.

46
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,960
There's a big thing behind this.

47
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,290
You can’t be responsible if it’s delayed.

48
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,880
KS KS 00CE 353

49
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,120
This is the Administrative Office of Zhexi.

50
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,160
Please identify Yeh Bik-ying.

51
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,860
This is Lieutenant Lee's number. Can he receive it?

52
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,040
Sir.

53
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:27,920
The Supreme Military Committee.

54
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,380
and military statistics.

55
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:32,240
This order

56
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,320
Send out the elite fast troop immediately.

57
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,640
Don't stop for a moment.

58
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,880
Escort Miss Ye safely.

59
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,720
No.13 Airport terminal

60
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,120
Make sure nothing goes wrong along the way.

61
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,560
Those who violate the law will be punished.

62
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:44,480
Oh.

63
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,280
This is a lady.

64
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,400
Inform the cavalry team to gather now.

65
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:51,680
No.

66
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,860
Go there yourself.

67
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,680
to escort Miss Ye to the Qizhou Airport.

68
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,280
Yes.

69
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,740
Can I leave now?

70
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:02,600
Miss Ye.

71
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,160
A call from my superior.

72
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,520
He asked me to send you to

73
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,720
to the No. 13 Airport of San Zhou Airport.

74
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,980
Did you find him for me?

75
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,640
Don't worry.

76
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,240
I'll send someone to search right away.

77
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,880
Find this. What Ichiro are you talking about?

78
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,760
Ichiro Takemichi.

79
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:14,640
Ichiro Takemichi.

80
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,240
I'll take you to the airline station too.

81
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:16,520
But

82
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,840
you have to leave now.

83
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,120
Our place

84
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,330
450 kilometers away from the airport.

85
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,800
It's going to rain tonight.

86
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,330
Let's go.

87
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,040
We can get there before dark.

88
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,200
If we travel at night,

89
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,800
I'm afraid you'll be in danger.

90
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,330
Besides,

91
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,920
there are Japanese soldiers within dozens of kilometers.

92
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,320
And

93
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,170
when you see your superior,

94
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,159
please

95
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:36,120
for me.

96
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,800
Please find this person for me.

97
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,480
Please.

98
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,080
Don't worry, Miss Ye.

99
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,080
Sir,

100
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,480
Airlines from Chongqing, Chen Nade.

101
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,520
Two U.S. T-40 aircrafts on the runway

102
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,720
encountered strong wind,

103
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,400
I couldn't fly to San State Airport.

104
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,130
and has returned to Chongqing.

105
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,520
Got it.

106
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,280
General’s calling.

107
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,080
The four districts of Zhexi escort a special envoy.

108
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:22,840
with a password

109
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,120
[Calling and radio logo.]

110
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,400
We're on our way to the airport.

111
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,260
It's expected to arrive at night.

112
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,600
Is it the password and number for tomorrow?

113
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,200
I think so.

114
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:36,600
Go.

115
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,159
Chen Youchao, Chief of Airlines 13,

116
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:43,600
is not in a hurry.

117
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,880
Because he doesn't know

118
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,760
to contact Dulit.

119
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,240
A signal machine with Hetz frequency

120
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,880
was burned on the C-39 transportation machine.

121
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,320
In fact,

122
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,840
Chen Youchao received a secret order

123
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,560
is to open the airport

124
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,040
to open the San State Airport.

125
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,320
The exact landing time

126
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,520
It could be the early morning of the 20th.

127
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,400
Calling headquarters.

128
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,480
At 9:45,

129
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,840
a double engine bomber

130
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,760
a double engine bomber was found

131
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,520
Fly west.

132
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,520
Calling headquarters.

133
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,720
9:45 p.m.

134
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,800
a double engine bomber

135
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,320
a double engine bomber was found

136
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,200
Fly west.

137
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:48,040
The American Navy

138
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,040
Without a double engine bomber,

139
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,380
The army's double engines can't fly.

140
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,960
That far?

141
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,680
This information is wrong.

142
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,200
Call the detective back.

143
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,800
Keep checking.

144
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,240
Yamamoto 56 Generals

145
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,800
He made plans to attack Tokyo.

146
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,960
The only thing he didn't expect was

147
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,400
the American Army's large double engine bomber

148
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,920
I can't believe it can take off

149
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:28,890
What's this?

150
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,410
Who are you to enter my room?

151
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:32,880
We know each other.

152
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,680
You said that.

153
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:36,680
Mine.

154
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,180
What are you doing?

155
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:38,800
Charge!

156
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,200
What are you doing?

157
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:39,640
Give it back!

158
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,720
That's how I sleep.

159
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,140
Ichiro Takemichi.

160
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,520
Give it back!

161
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,880
Good acting.

162
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,660
That was great.

163
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,160
You know what?

164
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,040
This is the best scene

165
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,560
since I met you.

166
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,520
Granny gave it to me.

167
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,450
It's for safety.

168
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,540
I'll be back when I'm done.

169
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,740
Wait for me.

170
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:19,840
Hang it here.

171
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,140
to keep everyone safe.

172
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,880
Director ordered

173
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,400
After completing the mission,

174
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,660
you must sacrifice her

175
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,200
and get out of it.

176
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,080
But no matter you go to the island or not,

177
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,600
she knows too much about us.

178
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,200
The result is the same.

179
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,050
Ichiro Takemichi-kun!

180
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:57,680
Ye Biying.

181
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,000
They all say that love

182
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,200
in life.

183
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,730
But I'm different from her.

184
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,120
When I first saw her,

185
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:11,890
I thought it was her.

186
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,520
Are you coming to my wedding?

187
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:18,280
See?

188
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,840
We'll talk about it later.

189
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,970
No, you have to come.

190
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,290
How can I get married if you don't come?

191
00:13:11,520 --> 00:13:12,240
Excuse me.

192
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,560
Mr. Takemuki Ichiro's mother?

193
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:17,960
Yes.

194
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,360
Who are you?

195
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,920
I'm Ichiro Takemichi's friend.

196
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,800
Let's go.

197
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,840
Look, the weather is great today.

198
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,640
It's perfect for aircraft training.

199
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,640
What do you think?

200
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:39,920
Indeed.

201
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,400
Oshima Ho.

202
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,850
We received an urgent call from Sambu Island yesterday.

203
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,480
The intelligence class

204
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,800
as a joke.

205
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,160
I saw it just now.

206
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:01,520
The U.S. army is bombing Tokyo today.

207
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:05,000
Do you think this information is reliable?

208
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:07,760
How could he know?

209
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,480
such important military information?

210
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,010
He's messing around again.

211
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:14,560
Yes.

212
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,120
Come in. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

213
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:17,580
Come in.

214
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,040
Sir,

215
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,320
We just received a notice from the headquarters.

216
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,360
Get ready.

217
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,020
The enemy plane will attack us in one day.

218
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,560
This is an emergency.

219
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,840
Report to headquarters immediately.

220
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,120
Set up a full alert.

221
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,520
The enemy might attack today.

222
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,240
Yes.

223
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,760
We've arrived at Japan's domain. We're here. We're here. We're here.

224
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,760
Pay attention to air-proof cannon.

225
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:13,520
Start shooting in 30 seconds.

226
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,280
Ready to shoot.

227
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,480
Start shooting.

228
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,200
Shoot.

229
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,520
Shoot!

230
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,640
Let's go.

231
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,480
Try the power of these bombs.

232
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,359
We did it!

233
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,560
Lieutenant Colonel!

234
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,680
Our fuel

235
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,560
will be located

236
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,120
at the designated landing point.

237
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:35,780
all of them.

238
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,200
Is the calculation accurate?

239
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,720
Yes, Lieutenant Colonel.

240
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,320
We'll take off 300 miles in advance.

241
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,080
The plane is falling on the sea.

242
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,480
We can only feed the fish.

243
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,520
Can you feel it?

244
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,240
We encountered a strong tail breeze.

245
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:55,960
With the power of the wind,

246
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,220
we can make it through.

247
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:59,000
We can do it.

248
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,080
Fly at full speed!

249
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:02,560
Roger.

250
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:15,650
Sergeant Brell.

251
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,200
Prepare the raft.

252
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,560
and emergency food.

253
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,140
Prepare to drop the plane and skydiving.

254
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,120
Lieutenant Colonel.

255
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,580
This tail is coming again.

256
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,720
Maybe we still have hope

257
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,120
safely landing in China.

258
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,080
Look at the land.

259
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,040
Contact the Qizhou Airport.

260
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,160
Lizhou Airport.

261
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,240
This is an American plane.

262
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,320
Please tell me the exact location of the airport.

263
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:53,050
Got it? Over.

264
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,240
Lizhou Airport.

265
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,080
This is an American plane. We can't get the signal.

266
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,600
Please tell me the exact location of the airport.

267
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,840
Got it? Over.

268
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:05,240
No response.

269
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,740
Raise the plane to 6,000 feet.

270
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:22,400
Sir.

271
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,210
I can't see the airport.

272
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,160
The plane is up to 8,000 feet.

273
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,520
Try to fly out of these thick clouds.

274
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,880
I hope we can see the San ju Airport soon.

275
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:01,920
Lieutenant Colonel.

276
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,240
We might have reached the sky of San State.

277
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,840
We can't see the airport yet.

278
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,120
If there's a cloud crack,

279
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,400
let the plane pass through.

280
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,680
I hope the airport is down there.

281
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,460
Continue to contact the airport.

282
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,560
Lizhou Airport

283
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,720
This is an American plane.

284
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:18,640
Please tell me the exact location of the airport.

285
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,040
Got it? Over.

286
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:31,280
Lizhou Airport.

287
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,400
This is an American plane.

288
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,720
Please tell me the exact location of the airport.

289
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:34,800
Got it? Over.

290
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,740
It's getting fewer and fewer.

291
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,600
Sergeant Lunnald.

292
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:47,880
Make sure the film in the camera is complete.

293
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:48,680
Don't lose it.

294
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,140
The weather is bad.

295
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,840
It's dark again.

296
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,120
We can't see anything.

297
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,160
Plane No. 7 ran out of fuel.

298
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,040
I repeat.

299
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,840
Plane No. 7 is out of fuel.

300
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:30,700
Turn on the automatic driver.

301
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,120
Turn off the gas.

302
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,600
Drop the plane.

303
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,690
This is an order.

304
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,320
Come on, guys!

305
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,180
skydiving.

306
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,120
I have no choice.

307
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,040
I have no choice, Charles. Let's go.

308
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,080
Open the door!

309
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,280
I'm the officer.

310
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,680
Which unit are you from?

311
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,160
Sir.

312
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:09,960
Are you the officer? Yes.

313
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:10,680
This is the envoy.

314
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,000
I brought the password and number.

315
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,400
Get someone to record it.

316
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,320
Record?

317
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,800
No, Lieutenant Colonel.

318
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:31,570
Let's go.

319
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:33,860
Get out of here.

320
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,680
What should I do?

321
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,320
I can't remember.

322
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:45,530
Let's go.

323
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,520
The plane is flying.

324
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,040
Lights.

325
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,360
The lights on the runway.

326
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:02,960
Turn it on.

327
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:03,880
Turn on the lantern.

328
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:04,520
Turn it on.

329
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,520
Open the airport.

330
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,160
Call me right away.

331
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,080
Hurry.

332
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,290
Turn on the lights. Okay. Okay.

333
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,560
Open the airport.

334
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,360
Send a signal.

335
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:27,120
It's the code. It's the code.

336
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:27,650
Hurry up.

337
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,000
7017702

338
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:29,640
770

339
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,040
70477705.

340
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,160
Calling from San Zhou Airport.

341
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:34,240
Please answer.

342
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,840
7017702.

343
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,720
770

344
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,240
70477705.

345
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,880
Calling from San Zhou Airport.

346
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,960
Please answer.

347
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,520
I've never liked you.

348
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,980
Do you understand?

349
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,520
Get lost!

350
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,040
Takemici!

351
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,600
I'm here.

352
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:43,520
Where are you?

353
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:11,560
It's dark.

354
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:14,560
I can't see you.

355
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,200
The night is heavy

356
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:30,240
I can't hug you.

357
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:33,600
The moon opens its eyes.

358
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:38,000
Star, say something!

359
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,400
Storm and storm

360
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:46,280
I will find you

361
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:50,680
Maybe our story

362
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:56,280
is not the most beautiful.

363
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:02,160
But when we are together,

364
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:05,520
The moon opens its eyes.

365
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:10,080
Star, say something.

366
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:13,120
To find you

367
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:18,040
I still have a lot to say.

368
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:21,080
Maybe

369
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:28,000
be together forever.

370
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,200
But I can

371
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,240
forget

372
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,480
The 16 B-25 bombers

373
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,920
16 B-25 bombers

374
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:40,480
Due to the early flight,

375
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,520
and ran out of gas,

376
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:44,320
Other than a forced landing in the Soviet Union,

377
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,320
the other 15 planes

378
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,960
were destroyed in Zhexi, China.

379
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,200
Captain No.1.

380
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,840
The commander-in-chief of Tokyo.

381
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,000
After he left the plane,

382
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,200
landed at Mount Tianeye in Zhexi.

383
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,600
outside Sheng Village.

384
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,640
[After getting rid of the chase,]

385
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,000
That night, he found himself

386
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,520
outside Mount Tianeye.

387
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,880
April 19th,

388
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:41,280
Du Lite found a Chinese soldier

389
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:44,360
was found by the search Chinese soldiers.

390
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:47,080
The first thing he said after landing was

391
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,720
I'm American.

392
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,480
Who are you?

393
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,480
German.

394
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,360
I'm American.

395
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,360
What did you say?

396
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,480
I'm American.

397
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,720
The American pilots bombed Japan.

398
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:05,960
They are heroes who beat Japanese.

399
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,040
That day at the Zhexi Office,

400
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:13,880
Du Lite

401
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:17,520
[sent the first telegram to General Arnold]

402
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:20,720
General Arnod sent the first telegram.

403
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,120
And here,

404
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:25,600
with other comrades of Camera 1.

405
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:31,560
My squadron has successfully bombed Tokyo.

406
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:34,760
Due to the bad weather in Japan,

407
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,520
the plane ran out of fuel.

408
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,880
So far,

409
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,040
five pilots are safe.

410
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,880
The plane is probably destroyed.

411
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,040
Lieutenant Colonel Du Lit.

412
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:50,000
April 19, 1942.

413
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:41,160
Camera No. 2 successfully landed on the coastal of China.

414
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,200
They were lucky

415
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:45,960
by the local guerrilla team.

416
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,520
Camera 1 and player 2

417
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:28,000
will meet the teacher on the way to Qizhou.

418
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:47,560
The forced landing of Camera 6 and Camera 7

419
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,360
failed.

420
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,280
After the engine ran out,

421
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:55,240
a head pierced into the beach outside Ningbo Elephant.

422
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:58,840
All five members of Camera 7 are injured.

423
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,720
Captain Lauson is seriously injured.

424
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,040
was amputated.

425
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:03,880
But they

426
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,560
of the Chinese soldiers,

427
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:10,360
All five crew members are safely

428
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:11,840
and returned to America.

429
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,280
No.7 Captain Lauson.

430
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,000
According to my experience,

431
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,040
I wrote the memory record of Tokyo's 30 seconds in the air.

432
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:29,800
Then Hollywood made a movie of the same name.

433
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,320
Cadet No.6 is not that lucky.

434
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:38,040
[was captured by the Japanese on the way.]

435
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:42,199
All the villagers were killed.

436
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,880
October 15, 1942.

437
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:47,679
[The Japanese were charged with war.]

438
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,679
the Japanese executed Captain 6

439
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,800
in Shanghai.

440
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:54,199
Lieutenant Dian Hawmark.

441
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:55,719
Captain 16.

442
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:58,040
Lieutenant William Faluo.

443
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,920
Camera 16, Gunman.

444
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,120
Sergeant Harold Basz.

445
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:08,400
Captain No. 16, Captain William Falo,

446
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:12,560
left a suicide note the day before his death.

447
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,000
[My dear parents.]

448
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:18,840
They're going to kill me.

449
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:23,040
But don't be sad after reading this letter.

450
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,240
We all know that

451
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,200
I've always wanted to be a pilot.

452
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,760
If it’s not because of this war,

453
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,080
I would have been

454
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,840
an airline driver.

455
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,920
After tomorrow,

456
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:43,520
I will never see you again.

457
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:44,960
I want you to know

458
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,200
I don't regret anything.

459
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:51,480
I volunteered to take part in this mission.

460
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:56,200
I'm proud that I'm a soldier.

461
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,280
In the end, I gave my life

462
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:01,880
to my country.

463
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:07,520
I love your son William Falo.

464
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:12,720
After Dulitt arrived at the Qizhou Airport,

465
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,760
the air raid in Tokyo

466
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,200
and rescued the people of China.

467
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,080
including Du Lite,

468
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:21,280
Bomber squadron pilot

469
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,880
64.

470
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,520
Five people forced the Soviet Union to land.

471
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,960
Three people died when they landed.

472
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:29,880
Eight were captured.

473
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,280
Among the 80 aircrafts,

474
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,000
64 were rescued.

475
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,320
was arranged by the Chinese government

476
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,720
to return to the United States.

477
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,520
After Du Lite returned,

478
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,400
[he was promoted to Brigadier General.]

479
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,320
and was awarded

480
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,480
the national assembly medal.

481
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:58,080
Because of the help of Chinese soldiers,

482
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,240
Japan launched

483
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,040
to destroy

484
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,720
to destroy all strategic airports

485
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,560
of all strategic airports.

486
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,800
In this battle,

487
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,120
Japanese soldiers killed

488
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:13,400
over 250,000 Chinese in Zhexi

489
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:17,520
made a large range around the airport.

490
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,920
After the Tokyo bombing,

491
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,920
the Japanese citizens lost their sense of security.

492
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,280
The Emperor keeps making mistakes

493
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,680
the Pacific War situation.

494
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:36,400
[Bad luck continues to fail.]

495
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:38,520
This big bombing

496
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,400
not only changed

497
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,720
the trajectory of the Pacific War.

498
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:45,600
It also frightened the Japanese

499
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,720
They were afraid that the country would be bombed again.

500
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,840
We have to draw a large number of soldiers

501
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,960
from China and the Pacific Area.

502
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,520
to strengthen the local defense.

503
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,160
After the war,

504
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,360
Military History experts found

505
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,000
the 30 seconds in Tokyo

506
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,760
has greatly affected

507
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,160
the deciding mind of the Japanese Cabinet.

508
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,280
disrupted the Japanese's war layout.

509
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,400
After that,

510
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,520
the Japanese have never

511
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,760
they have never won

512
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,920
a decisive victory.

513
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,800
Dulitt raided Tokyo.

514
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:37,200
became the most important turning point of the Pacific War.

515
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,720
In 1993,

516
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:52,160
Dulitt died in California.

517
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:56,480
President Rigen held a funeral for him

518
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,600
and ordered all the flying

519
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,560
B-25 bombers

520
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:05,800
They all went up to commemorate.

521
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:14,280
April 25, 1947

522
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,840
Agent Chief of Macau Rong

523
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:19,880
Taec-young and Yamaguchi Kumi

524
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:23,880
was executed for anti-human crimes.

525
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,280
[June 16, 1942.]

526
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,240
Akashi and Ryusegawa

527
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,960
[were arrested during the battle]

528
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,120
was arrested on his way to Yan'an.

529
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:41,520
They were sent to Japan for execution.

530
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,960
August 1945.

531
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,640
[The Japanese surrendered.]

532
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:49,640
They were released from the alliance.

533
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:54,880
In 1973, Akashi died of stomach cancer.

534
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,360
He was 62 years old.

535
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,600
In 1982,

536
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,880
Longze once accepted the invitation

537
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:05,960
as a Chinese friend.

538
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:09,640
He died of illness in 1987.

539
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,480
80 years old.

540
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,720
After Du Lite's incident,

541
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:45,120
Ye Biying insisted on returning to Zhongshan County, her hometown.

542
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:49,220
In the eight districts of Zhongshan, closest to Sanbu Island,

543
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,040
to Sankanma Island.

544
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,400
Affirmative work.

545
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,640
He was once a commissioner

546
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:56,280
of Sector 8.

547
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,480
[He was transferred to Sector 9.]

548
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:03,000
The night before the victory in 1944.

549
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,320
She was only 26 years old.

550
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:11,040
[She didn't get to see]

551
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:16,000
and never saw Ichiro Takemichi.

552
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:31,560
June 1942.

553
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,400
Two months after the bombing of Tokyo,

554
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,040
The Tokyo Intelligence Team was captured.

555
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,120
The Japanese government

556
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:42,320
July 5, 1942.

557
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,320
Number 301 is known as

558
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,640
The spy organization has infiltrated

559
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:49,800
the core department of Japan.

560
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,240
There are many people in Tokyo.

561
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,400
Kyoto!

562
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,560
Hiroshima.

563
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,720
Kyushu.

564
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,560
Hokkaido regions.

565
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:03,080
The night before the US Army entered Tokyo in 1945,

566
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:05,520
all the files of the spy organization

567
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:09,600
was burned down by the Japanese government.

568
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,520
