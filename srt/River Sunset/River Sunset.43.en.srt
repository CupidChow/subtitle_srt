1
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:38,560
Oshima!

2
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,400
Good work on the island.

3
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,520
I look forward to your future performance.

4
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,160
The passing light

5
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,640
The cherry blossoms in spring have long withered.

6
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,160
Oshima.

7
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,240
How many years have you been in the army?

8
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,720
Please forgive me.

9
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,720
I can't remember. I can't remember.

10
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,079
Raise your head.

11
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,640
Do you remember Kurozaki?

12
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,800
That little guy.

13
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,079
has a mole on his face.

14
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,040
The one you used to hit.

15
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,720
I remember.

16
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,320
That short fatty

17
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,400
His singing is never in tune.

18
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,080
That's him.

19
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:24,320
You and I are like cherry blossoms.

20
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:40,120
blooming in the garden of the same cadet.

21
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:53,840
With the blooming and withering

22
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:00,000
Kurozaki!

23
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,200
He's done his best! He's done his best!

24
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,400
Oshima! Oshima!

25
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,360
What about you?

26
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,640
Commander.

27
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,560
You want me

28
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,000
to serve the Emperor, right?

29
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,720
I can accept it.

30
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:36,280
Think carefully.

31
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:39,880
Yes.

32
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,120
I don't know if I should tell you this.

33
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,240
At my age,

34
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,840
I can't believe I thought of something unbelievable.

35
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,320
How should I put it?

36
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:06,120
Commander.

37
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,520
If what you said is true,

38
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,560
I will bravely accept the fate.

39
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,040
If it's fake

40
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,060
I would have done it

41
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,400
to risk my life.

42
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,640
You know me well.

43
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:52,880
Open it.

44
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,360
Is this yours?

45
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,240
Here you go. Here you go.

46
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,480
Get ready to go.

47
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,159
There are four bomb shelves in this base.

48
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:38,720
Two bomb shelves

49
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,040
and five bulletproof fuel storage.

50
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:43,060
are probably at these locations.

51
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,760
On the whole island,

52
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,520
they set up a dozen sentries.

53
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,640
Each sentry

54
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,360
About 10 to 20 soldiers.

55
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,800
After retreating,

56
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,920
the number of sentries has become three.

57
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,320
They are Tan Jiawan from Sancao Street.

58
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,080
Their forces

59
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,640
are less than ten.

60
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:04,800
And...

61
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,130
There are two air researchers at the base.

62
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,280
And the airport.

63
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,320
There are two cannons in the northeast and southeast of the airport.

64
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,920
Among all the facilities,

65
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,720
can be connected through phone.

66
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,880
And most of the soldiers on this island

67
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,840
were transferred back to the headquarters of Tokyo.

68
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,400
Only the 14th Airlines are left.

69
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,880
There are about 200 or 300 of them.

70
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,160
That should be it.

71
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,600
I suggest

72
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,400
If possible,

73
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,850
let's take down this sentry first.

74
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,520
Because the first place

75
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,080
The sentry is far away.

76
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,400
If something happens,

77
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,059
it won't be easy to be noticed.

78
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,580
Second,

79
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,040
There are only three people guarding this sentry.

80
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,240
Third, if we defeat them,

81
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,900
you can get a batch of weapons.

82
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,120
Remember.

83
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,000
Remember to find the telephone line and cut it off.

84
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:08,920
Sir.

85
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:16,520
Sir, we found the translator.

86
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,600
Commander.

87
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,040
Don’t leave my sight

88
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,280
without my order.

89
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,920
Ungrateful Chinese.

90
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,080
Translate the battle report

91
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,520
translated to me.

92
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,840
Get lost.

93
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,840
Yes.

94
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,240
Is it here

95
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,040
Yes, it's here.

96
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,840
Split up.

97
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,560
Search inside.

98
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,640
Yes.

99
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,960
Let's split up.

100
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,400
Here.

101
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,360
Search carefully.

102
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,480
Hurry up.

103
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,640
Did you check carefully?

104
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,400
Sorry.

105
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,640
Check carefully.

106
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,160
Listen carefully.

107
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:37,720
Search carefully.

108
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,120
Yes.

109
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,520
Communist Party Jujiang No.7 Ranger Squad.

110
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:46,680
to save most of the people from Sambu Island.

111
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,080
Left, right, left.

112
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:07,200
Round and round.

113
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:13,240
Put me in a coffin and ship me home.

114
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:19,400
Put a medal on my chest.

115
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,360
Tell moms I've tried my best.

116
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,140
The boys by Du Lit are really good.

117
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,800
Most of them

118
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,400
may not come back.

119
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,040
This bombing mission

120
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,360
is the most difficult one I've ever seen.

121
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,160
OK.

122
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,520
Everything is ready.

123
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:40,800
Tomorrow morning,

124
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,880
tomorrow morning.

125
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,920
According to Chinese information,

126
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,720
There are patrol boats in 700 sea in Japan.

127
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,920
All right, report it now.

128
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:30,480
We found a Japanese patrol ship ahead.

129
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,800
Location 276 degrees.

130
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:33,880
It's 42 degrees away.

131
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,140
What about the Shogun?

132
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,520
Order the bodyguards!

133
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,760
Prepare for the first-class combat!

134
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,240
Full speed ahead!

135
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,520
Radar detected Japanese patrol ships.

136
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:01,920
General.

137
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,960
We've located the Japanese patrol ship.

138
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,320
9 o'clock ahead.

139
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,160
Yamamoto 56.

140
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,040
That despicable man.

141
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:11,920
I didn't expect

142
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,080
he would send a patrol ship

143
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,720
to patrol this far.

144
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,360
Shoot the patrol ship immediately!

145
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,760
We can't let it expose our whereabouts.

146
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,240
If we take off at this distance,

147
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:22,200
is too far from Japan

148
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,400
is too far from Japan.

149
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,560
Stevens.

150
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,160
Sir.

151
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,160
Give this to the general.

152
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:09,760
Right now.

153
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,120
Sir!

154
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,360
Sir!

155
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,600
We've intercepted the Japanese patrol ship.

156
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,160
A telegram from the base.

157
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,600
Tokyo time 6:30 p.m.

158
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,560
Tokyo is 700 miles east

159
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,840
Three American navigators were found.

160
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,800
Six bodyguards.

161
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,240
Location 152 degrees east.

162
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,400
36 degrees north.

163
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,640
Damn it!

164
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,240
It's too late.

165
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,000
They've reported it to the headquarters.

166
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,360
Sir.

167
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:58,880
Come in.

168
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:05,480
Headquarters received a report

169
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,520
on Patrol Ship No. 23, Ildong-maru.

170
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,840
We found the formation of three American navigators.

171
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,320
The Americans are finally here.

172
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,680
Should we check further?

173
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,840
No. 23 of Iltomaru hasn't answered.

174
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:37,840
I guess

175
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,360
by the US Army.

176
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,280
Where's number 23?

177
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:43,320
Where is it?

178
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,400
Tokyo, 700 miles east.

179
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:55,040
They fulfilled their mission.

180
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:09,040
A warning from American warships approaching the land.

181
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,280
Immediately.

182
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:13,520
Carry out Plan 3.

183
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:21,839
Emergency plan to attack American fleets.

184
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,680
Record the operation order.

185
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,520
Search the enemy.

186
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,250
I order Kondo Shinjo

187
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:46,320
to command the sixth foreign ship

188
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:50,000
and ten expelled ships

189
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,840
Set off from Yokosuka Port immediately.

190
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:59,600
Order General Takasu

191
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,880
to lead four battleships

192
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:05,300
to sail from the anchor site of Guangdao Bay.

193
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,040
ordered General Nam Yunzhong

194
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,960
to command

195
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,880
including five navigators,

196
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:23,160
and five navigators.

197
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:31,720
They're 700 miles away from Japan.

198
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,240
Less than 19 days,

199
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:39,160
the U.S. army can't attack.

200
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:46,760
So the order for the upcoming combat

201
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,320
will be given 19 days.

202
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:49,850
Over.

203
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,840
Another telegram.

204
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:21,760
General!

205
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,480
We intercepted a telegram

206
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,540
a telegram from General Yamamoto 56.

207
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:27,770
Yes, sir.

208
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,960
Carry out Plan 3.

209
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,880
Emergency plan to attack the American fleet.

210
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,600
Five navigators

211
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,520
and 250 planes.

212
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,380
Search the U.S. fleet to the east.

213
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,040
General Kondo Shinjo Navy

214
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,080
command six foreign ships and ten expelled ships.

215
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,640
from Yokosuga.

216
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,280
General Takashirou Navy!

217
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,920
led four battleships

218
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,980
to sail from Hiroshima Baeju Island.

219
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,120
The first airship

220
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:03,360
It's led by Namwoon Choong-il.

221
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,920
He has five navigators.

222
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,520
The Japanese sent their entire Navy

223
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,320
to welcome us.

224
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,480
How far is Japan?

225
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,960
About 650 miles. General.

226
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,280
It’s 250 miles away

227
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,520
250 miles away.

228
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,520
If they take off now,

229
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:19,920
it means our boys

230
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,840
exceeded the maximum flight.

231
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,880
They can hardly land safely.

232
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,160
General, if we

233
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,840
to the designated starting point,

234
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,720
our navigator

235
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:28,880
will be overwhelmed by the Japanese Navy!

236
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:29,940
by the entire Navy.

237
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,800
I have no choice.

238
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,280
Order Du Lite

239
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:36,680
Bomber will take off now.

240
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:45,760
Level 1 combat alert!

241
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:46,600
General Halkie ordered you

242
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,280
to take off now.

243
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:47,800
I know.

244
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,520
We haven't arrived at the designated place yet.

245
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,250
But the navigator must return.

246
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,000
Yes, General Michell.

247
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,060
Everyone is ready.

248
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,080
Good luck.

249
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,800
May God bless you.

250
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,640
Guys,

251
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,160
Let's take off.

252
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,720
Let's go

253
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,320
Hurry up, men.

254
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,580
Let's go bombing Tokyo

255
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,520
Guys!

256
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:30,760
Hurry up.

257
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,560
Guys, hurry up.

258
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:42,880
Lower your head.

259
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,460
The largest accelerator.

260
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,400
The largest accelerator.

261
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,080
Let's go, 701.

262
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,160
Continue Kele.

263
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,520
The guide is targeting the Aeronaut of Yellow Bee.

264
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,920
God bless you.

265
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:27,600
Guys,

266
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,320
Now it's our turn.

267
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,520
Let's show them how we can pay them back.

268
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:55,280
Colonel.

269
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,160
Have you heard of the Bear Hunting Project?

270
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,740
As a military officer,

271
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:05,480
you must know more than us.

272
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,080
In 1938,

273
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,640
Colonel Yushkov who fled from the Soviet Union

274
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,080
and Kwandong Intelligence Department

275
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,400
to assassinate Scarlin.

276
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,400
This operation is perfect.

277
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:30,210
But when the assassination team entered the border,

278
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:33,400
A team of patrol

279
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,730
shot everyone to death.

280
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:37,760
Why?

281
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,650
The Japanese information was leaked.

282
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,040
The problem is who leaked the secret.

283
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,520
Is it Colonel Yushkov?

284
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,000
Or...

285
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,360
Lieutenant Colonel Takawa.

286
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:00,520
Or...

287
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:45,370
Colonel.

288
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,260
Don’t play any tricks.

289
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:51,600
Otherwise,

290
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,930
we won't be able to reach our destination.

291
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,120
One more.

292
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,580
Sit over there.

293
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,480
If I'm not mistaken,

294
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,680
you should

295
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,720
with

296
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,440
an important secret.

297
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,120
The key password

298
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,200
is

299
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,560
Miss Ye Biying.

300
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,240
Or...

301
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,120
the password is

302
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,600
on her.

303
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,760
This secret should be...

304
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:57,240
about bombing Tokyo.

305
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,760
Now...

306
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,640
Tell me the details.

307
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,680
This is your best shooting distance.

308
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,240
Keep this posture.

309
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,100
Get close to the enemy! All right!

310
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,160
Target!

311
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,880
One shot to death.

312
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,280
It's okay.

313
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,880
Put the gun down.

314
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,400
Ye Biying.

315
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:19,120
Ye Biying.

316
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,000
It's okay.

317
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,400
Drop your gun.

318
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,480
Relax.

319
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,520
Sit down.

320
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:42,840
Listen to me.

321
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:45,880
Without him,

322
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,970
the chance of us completing the mission will be greater.

323
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,000
You're hurt.

324
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,200
I'm fine.

325
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,000
Be gentle.

326
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:48,600
I'm fine.

327
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,490
Press it.

328
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,640
Press it hard.

329
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:54,760
Stop working.

330
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:55,400
I'm fine.

331
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,290
I'm really fine.

332
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,680
It's up to me whether you're hurt or not.

333
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:02,250
Press it.

334
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,360
It didn't hurt the vital part.

335
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,160
Stop yelling.

336
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,520
Press tight.

337
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,520
You pressed me too hard.

338
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:15,520
Be gentle.

339
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,920
We still have time.

340
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,000
I can hold on until I land.

341
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,160
It's okay.

342
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,520
The bullet that can kill me

343
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:46,980
hasn't been produced yet.

344
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,850
What are you looking at?

345
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:39,720
What?

346
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,180
Congratulations.

347
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,160
and myself.

348
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:54,000
We're almost there.

349
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,120
So many people were sacrificed.

350
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,520
What does success mean?

351
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,560
Maybe we can end this war in advance.

352
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,960
What will you do

353
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,000
after the war?

354
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:33,810
I don't know.

355
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:36,580
I don't know. I don't know.

356
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,219
What about you?

357
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,000
I plan to

358
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,600
a very serious man.

359
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,730
and get married.

360
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,360
They all say that love

361
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,679
in life.

362
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,090
But I'm different from her.

363
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,680
When I first saw her,

364
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,520
I thought it was her.

365
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:14,970
When the mission is completed,

366
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,520
both in China and Japan,

367
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,640
I have to get married soon.

368
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,800
Will you come if I invite you?

369
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:31,800
See?

370
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,720
We'll talk about it later.

371
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:36,850
No, you have to come.

372
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,810
How can I get married if you don't come?

373
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,090
Put the gun down.

374
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,120
It's okay.

375
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,320
The culprit tried to escape.

376
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,720
I shot him to death.

377
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,000
But I got hurt too.

378
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,740
I need treatment as soon as possible.

379
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:10,600
I order you

380
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,040
change the route

381
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,640
Fly to Zhejiang.

382
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,720
Execute the order.

383
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,600
If it weren't for the slow reaction of the injury,

384
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,060
I could have snatched two.

385
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,120
Now there's only one.

386
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,920
