1
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,200
Yingying, come eat.

2
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,640
Dad.

3
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,720
Your return should have been a happy occasion.

4
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:35,400
But look at you now.

5
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:37,760
The way you dress.

6
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,570
I barely recognize you.

7
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,760
This is all I can wear now.

8
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,100
Since the Japanese occupied Sanzao Island,

9
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,520
I often told your mother's photo

10
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,730
to rest assured,

11
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,400
that I would hold on until you returned,

12
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,960
to see you living a happy life.

13
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:06,620
And now you've finally returned.

14
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,500
Yes, returned indeed.

15
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,400
But with a Japanese person.

16
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,280
And your behavior

17
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,800
confuses me greatly.

18
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,520
Tell me honestly,

19
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,460
what have you been doing all these years?

20
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,760
I went to Shanghai.

21
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,079
Didn't you go north?

22
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,220
Why did you go to Shanghai?

23
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,840
Dad, please don't ask.

24
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,820
Trust that I have principles in what I do.

25
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,880
Everything I do

26
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,000
is to help more people

27
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
survive.

28
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,250
Is there something you want to tell me?

29
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,080
Dad.

30
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:14,900
Is there something about our family you're hiding from me?

31
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,240
Come, let's eat.

32
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,970
I'm done eating.

33
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,260
I need to go out for a while.

34
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,240
I didn't say anything.

35
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,360
I'm finished too.

36
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,080
What's today's mission?

37
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,200
Reporting, Colonel.

38
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:39,920
Today's mission is

39
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,520
to attack the Yue-Han railway line and Jiangcun Bridge.

40
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:42,840
Go.

41
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,900
According to the plan,

42
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,040
Wumu must scout out the island today,

43
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,720
mapping all the terrain

44
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,120
and the deployment of troops on the island.

45
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,280
Meanwhile, Ye Biying

46
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:59,000
should be visiting relatives and friends on the island.

47
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,640
We were secretly tracking down the messenger

48
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,000
but the sentries that suddenly appeared last night

49
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
disrupted all our plans.

50
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,640
Search this area again.

51
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:28,840
How can we not even find the body?

52
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,520
What is it?

53
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,040
Is Major Wumu here?

54
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,000
What?

55
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,200
Wumu.

56
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,040
Go away! Step back!

57
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,200
Miss Ye.

58
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:50,760
You're just in time.

59
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,360
Can you ask him

60
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,680
if Major Wumu is here?

61
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,880
Sure.

62
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,760
Excuse me.

63
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,360
This is Miss Ye,

64
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,680
Major Wumu's assistant who came to the island with him.

65
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,520
She needs to see Major Wumu.

66
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,760
Is the Major at the airport barracks now?

67
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,240
No.

68
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,920
He's not here? I...

69
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,640
Then can you ask where he went?

70
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,640
Where did he go?

71
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,600
He said he was going out for a while.

72
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,400
He didn't say where,

73
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,540
but the car was heading toward Paotai Mountain.

74
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:18,760
Thank you.

75
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,600
He said Major Wumu

76
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,680
went in the direction of Paotai Mountain.

77
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,680
Paotai Mountain.

78
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,920
Wumu knows

79
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,040
this is the location arranged by Director Shen

80
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,080
for the second evacuation plan rendezvous.

81
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,090
But Director Shen doesn't know

82
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,080
there's a hidden anti-aircraft gun position here.

83
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,440
Colonel.

84
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,560
Colonel.

85
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,720
Bring me the binoculars.

86
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,840
How far is it from here to Macau?

87
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,040
Reporting, Colonel.

88
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,120
13 nautical miles.

89
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:48,840
In that direction,

90
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,040
you can see the lights of Macau at night.

91
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:58,840
Good work.

92
00:08:59,040 --> 00:08:59,570
Yes, sir.

93
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,080
What happened?

94
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,740
Can you promise me something?

95
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,360
No matter what happens,

96
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,600
you'll protect my family's safety.

97
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,920
My father,

98
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,720
Fourth Aunt and my brother.

99
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,880
If it helps you work with peace of mind,

100
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,600
I will definitely do that.

101
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,480
You promised.

102
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:51,800
I did.

103
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,920
This is a portable disposable

104
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,120
morphine injector needle from the US military.

105
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,720
Produced by the American company Squibb

106
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,650
Syrette needle.

107
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,640
Where did you find it?

108
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,170
At Fourth Aunt's hometown.

109
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,920
Can we assume that

110
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,680
your Fourth Aunt rescued that American pilot

111
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:19,940
and hid him in her home?

112
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,080
That doesn't make sense though.

113
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,280
With such a large-scale search by the Japanese army,

114
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,810
how could they not find him?

115
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,380
It wasn't just my Fourth Aunt, was it?

116
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,520
Let's go to your house now.

117
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,360
I need to talk to your father.

118
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,080
Wait.

119
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,720
I haven't had a chance to tell you that

120
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:38,760
my father took me to see the mass grave this morning.

121
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,480
The Japanese army carried out a massacre on the island.

122
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,120
Over ten thousand villagers died.

123
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,040
Not just my father,

124
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,080
but Fourth Aunt and my brother too.

125
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,240
They all hate Japanese soldiers.

126
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,880
Everyone in the village does.

127
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,210
My father won't help us.

128
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,620
You have me.

129
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,080
Sasaki.

130
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,000
That's the situation with the missing sentry.

131
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,440
I've heard about it.

132
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,440
Listen carefully.

133
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:27,680
Organize the police unit immediately

134
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,320
and the garrison to search the entire island.

135
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,200
But Captain, you're still here.

136
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:31,920
Don't worry about me.

137
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,560
I can't leave right now.

138
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,400
You're the only one who can handle this now.

139
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,320
Take some men with you.

140
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:39,560
Your main task isn't to find

141
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,640
that missing soldier.

142
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,840
What's important is to use this opportunity

143
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,400
to go to Ye Degong's house again

144
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,280
and uncover the secret behind that wall.

145
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,520
If you actually find a secret room

146
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,560
or

147
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,800
capture that American who landed on the island,

148
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,000
send someone to inform me immediately.

149
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,730
Let's begin the operation.

150
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,280
Yes, sir.

151
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,540
First squad, move out!

152
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,280
About face!

153
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,360
Double time!

154
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,840
Wumu never expected

155
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,480
to obtain information

156
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,960
about the American messenger so quickly,

157
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,960
and in his own assistant's home.

158
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,320
But he knew well

159
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:39,050
that making the Ye family hand over the messenger wouldn't be easy.

160
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,440
It's not that simple.

161
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,140
Don't take off your clothes in front of my house.

162
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,320
No way.

163
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,440
Fine.

164
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,360
Don't let him in.

165
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:57,680
It's okay.

166
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,000
I brought him here.

167
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,260
He needs to talk to Dad.

168
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,680
Hello, Mr. Ye.

169
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:04,530
I'm Wumu Yilang.

170
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,200
Nice to meet you.

171
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:07,650
Let's go.

172
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,820
The sentry is dead.

173
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,490
I'll visit you another day.

174
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,040
Go back to bed.

175
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,890
You don't understand what I'm saying?

176
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,320
Put down your weapon.

177
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,240
Mr. Ye,

178
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:37,760
Dad.

179
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,280
we'd like to have a word with you.

180
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:44,680
Mr. Ye,

181
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,200
we were in a rush yesterday.

182
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:46,640
Today,

183
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,000
I'm formally paying my respects to

184
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,880
the father of my assistant, Ye Biying.

185
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,120
My name is Wu Muyilang,

186
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,320
an investigator from the Emperor's Chamberlain Office.

187
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,600
I have nothing to say to you.

188
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,320
Go back.

189
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,800
Mr. Ye.

190
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,880
I need to have a formal conversation with you.

191
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,540
I hope you'll give me a chance.

192
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,200
To talk with you properly today.

193
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,730
We have nothing to discuss.

194
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,290
Please stop pursuing my daughter.

195
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,240
Cats and mice don't sleep together.

196
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,240
Tigers and deer don't walk the same path.

197
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,320
There's nothing to talk about between us.

198
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,320
Dad, I...

199
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:32,880
Between Biying and me,

200
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,210
it's not what you think.

201
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,740
I also promise you.

202
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:36,840
I have never done

203
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,700
anything to harm Chinese people.

204
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,220
I have nothing to say to Japanese people.

205
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,760
I can swear to you.

206
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,940
I would never hurt your daughter.

207
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,180
Please believe me.

208
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,280
But you're standing here as an invader,

209
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:51,880
on

210
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,360
invaded soil.

211
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,640
Did I invite you in?

212
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:01,800
Get out.

213
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,280
That uniform of yours won't convince me.

214
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,040
Get out.

215
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,250
Colonel.

216
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,330
What are you doing here?

217
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,400
We're ordered to search this place.

218
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,410
Since I arrived on this island,

219
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,280
Commander Fujita has expressed

220
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,540
his respect for Mr. Ye.

221
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,360
If you find anyone here,

222
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,280
I'll execute their entire family for you.

223
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,520
If you find no one,

224
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,960
I'll shoot you dead.

225
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,010
Or you can explain yourself to Commander Fujita.

226
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,440
Dad.

227
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,640
I'm sorry, Mr. Ye.

228
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,050
For disturbing you.

229
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,520
Thank you for your help

230
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:13,250
in keeping us from being harassed.

231
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,800
However,

232
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,980
regarding my daughter's matter,

233
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,640
I think we have nothing more to discuss.

234
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:21,960
Dad.

235
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,490
He's not here to discuss me.

236
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:24,119
Don't be so stubborn.

237
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:24,520
Mr. Ye,

238
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,060
this is important.

239
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,140
I hope you'll give me a chance.

240
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:29,920
Xia'er, see him out.

241
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,080
Dad.

242
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:33,840
Mr. Ye.

243
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,120
Mr. Ye.

244
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,240
I, Wu Muyilang, will visit again another day.

245
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:49,840
Goodbye.

246
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,520
This is my assistant's home.

247
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,640
From today onwards,

248
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,700
without my orders,

249
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,120
no one is allowed to disturb them.

250
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:19,920
Is that clear?

251
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,400
This puts me in a difficult position.

252
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,600
Unless your superior

253
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,720
has his approval,

254
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,520
tell him to speak to me directly.

255
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,880
Didn't perform well?

256
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,020
But I still gained something.

257
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,440
I can now basically confirm

258
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,360
that your father and that American are connected.

259
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,600
Isn't that obvious?

260
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,240
But the key question is,

261
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,520
are they in any danger?

262
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,320
Inoue is now locked in solitary confinement,

263
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,050
so the American is safe for now.

264
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,720
Tonight, Lieutenant General Fujita

265
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,360
has prepared a welcome dinner for us.

266
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,760
If we attend as scheduled

267
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,040
and you perform well,

268
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,440
managing to handle things smoothly,

269
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,840
your family will be safe for the time being.

270
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,280
Is this even reliable? Seriously.

271
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,760
So to make this more credible,

272
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,680
since we still have some time before the banquet,

273
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,940
I need to give you some special training.

274
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:43,900
Special training?

275
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,480
Really? Training?

276
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,360
Is your Military Intelligence

277
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,440
always this last-minute with preparations?

278
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,000
No, no.

279
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,740
Just cramming at the last minute.

280
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:54,930
How did it go?

281
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,200
The search failed.

282
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,600
Why?

283
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,960
The Colonel wouldn't let me search.

284
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:00,360
At that time,

285
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:00,880
Colonel Muki was talking with that old man.

286
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,540
They were arguing intensely.

287
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,880
What were they discussing?

288
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,010
I don't know either.

289
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,600
I see.

290
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,480
You probably interrupted

291
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,120
a negotiation between a future son-in-law and his future father-in-law.

292
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,160
It seems Colonel Muki

293
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,440
is really taking this Chinese woman seriously.

294
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,300
He also said...

295
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,240
What else did he say?

296
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:22,000
If there's really a need to search the Ye family home,

297
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,360
my superiors must negotiate with him first.

298
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,120
What did you say?

299
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,640
That bastard.

300
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,840
[Salute]

301
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,000
This colonel is taking advantage of

302
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,200
his minor position in the imperial palace

303
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,530
and doesn't respect anyone on the island.

304
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,240
Can't we do something about him?

305
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,640
I'm curious who could make

306
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,840
Captain Inoue, who always annoys others,

307
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:18,480
so angry.

308
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,120
Long time no see.

309
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,480
What are you up to?

310
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,480
Carrying out my mission.

311
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,560
My eyes.

312
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,600
I've finally waited for your return.

313
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,720
Don't cross this line.

314
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,280
It stinks.

315
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,440
How many days since you last showered?

316
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,440
Sorry.

317
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,360
Just talk to me from over there.

318
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,680
A sentry went missing yesterday.

319
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,360
But that missing American

320
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,800
still hasn't been found.

321
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,960
Many strange things have happened lately.

322
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,290
That woman the colonel brought

323
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,120
is very suspicious.

324
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:45,680
That strange colonel and his strange woman

325
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:49,160
whether those people pose a threat to us,

326
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,280
we need to investigate further.

327
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,840
This arrogant guy,

328
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,300
what's his purpose for coming to the island?

329
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,520
He even prevented

330
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,980
Sasaki from searching the Ye family's home.

331
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:00,680
Also,

332
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,040
as soon as the American plane crashed,

333
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:04,960
the colonel and his woman entered the island right after.

334
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,960
As soon as they arrived, someone died.

335
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,760
This is all too damn convenient.

336
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,520
I've probed him about the lookout's death.

337
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,580
He really has no motive for the crime.

338
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:20,160
It could actually be the work of someone from Macau.

339
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,040
Besides,

340
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,720
that woman, as soon as she arrived on the island,

341
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,640
was interrogated by us.

342
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,880
But soon after, the Colonel took him away.

343
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,360
I understand what happened now.

344
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,560
Scream louder!

345
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:43,640
Let everyone outside hear you.

346
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,170
Let them all know you're in special training.

347
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,440
Let me tell you something.

348
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,600
I don't like you acting this way.

349
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,930
I don't like the way you're acting either.

350
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,440
Don't start taking this act seriously, okay?

351
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,040
We're just putting on a show.

352
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,300
What kind of girl do you like then?

353
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,720
I like someone fun.

354
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:12,960
How fun?

355
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,960
More fun than you.

356
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,320
I thought what just happened was quite fun.

357
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,160
Remember this.

358
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:20,600
As a dancer,

359
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:21,880
first,

360
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,640
she's already used to physical contact.

361
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:25,840
Tonight at the party,

362
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,920
Japanese officers will definitely ask you to dance.

363
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,360
If you treat them like you treated me,

364
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,560
we're both finished.

365
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:10,640
What are you doing?

366
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,440
What are you looking at?

367
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,240
Is there something up there?

368
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,520
Why do you keep looking up?

369
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,650
Look at me, will you?

370
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,360
Look at me.

371
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,000
Look at me.

372
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,020
Second.

373
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,680
As a dancer,

374
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,740
your eyes should never waver.

375
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:24,880
Look at me.

376
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,440
Whether you pass tonight

377
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,640
doesn't depend on me,

378
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,680
but on you.

379
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,420
What are you doing?

380
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:00,460
Point number 3.

381
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,780
Remember this.

382
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,640
A dancer

383
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,760
has a thousand ways to refuse her clients,

384
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,720
not like this.

385
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,880
If you do this tonight,

386
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,210
we'll both be finished.

387
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,800
Mr. Wumu,

388
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,200
your hand is in the wrong place.

389
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:14,880
Not good.

390
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:16,480
Mr. Wumu,

391
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,320
please be gracious.

392
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:20,720
That's not right either.

393
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,680
Mr. Wumu,

394
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,240
why is your hand moving faster than your heart?

395
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,680
Hmm, it's getting somewhat interesting.

396
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,540
Remember this.

397
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,040
Always keep smiling.

398
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,880
A smile is your best cover.

399
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,360
Your profession

400
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,440
is being a dance partner at a dance hall in Shanghai.

401
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,200
Is that so?

402
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,680
These days,

403
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,360
it's a decent profession.

404
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:14,480
You're at the Cathay Grand Ballroom on Edward Road

405
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,010
working as a dance hostess.

406
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,800
I've been to that dance hall.

407
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,440
The lighting is nice.

408
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,840
It's just that

409
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,360
the marble dance floor is a bit too slippery.

410
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,760
On Metherst Road.

411
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:35,760
The Cathay Ballroom is on Maxwell Road,

412
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:38,800
not where you said it was.

413
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,760
Also,

414
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,160
it has a spring dance floor,

415
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,200
not marble.

416
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,240
Our ideal takeoff zone

417
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,200
is 400 miles east of Tokyo.

418
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,080
I suggest on the 19th,

419
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,800
one plane takes off three hours before dusk.

420
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,250
The other planes will take off at dusk.

421
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,080
After flying for 2 hours,

422
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,440
we'll drop bombs on Tokyo at night.

423
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,440
Before the Japanese wake up,

424
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,000
we'll be on our way to China.

425
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,760
By dawn on the 20th,

426
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,490
we'll land at Quzhou Airfield.

427
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,840
After refueling,

428
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,360
we'll continue flying to

429
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,200
Chongqing, China's wartime capital.

430
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:41,360
I've heard many stories about your exploits, Doolittle.

431
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:42,640
Everyone here knows that

432
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,320
Pearl Harbor

433
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,680
was the greatest humiliation of my life.

434
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,280
Nothing would please me more

435
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,680
than striking back at those damn Japanese.

436
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:52,720
But this is a crazy plan.

437
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:57,600
The Navy and Army have never collaborated like this before.

438
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,440
General,

439
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:03,160
we are indeed doing what others wouldn't dare to imagine.

440
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,440
I still have doubts.

441
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:11,080
Sir, that's why I'm here today.

442
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:11,960
To eliminate the Navy's concerns

443
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,090
about our Army pilots' capabilities.

444
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,040
Listen up, Jimmy.

445
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,920
If your test flight succeeds today,

446
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,240
within three days,

447
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,840
you'll load your planes onto the Hornet.

448
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:27,520
Then,

449
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,440
on the morning of April 2nd,

450
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:32,600
Captain Mitchell will lead

451
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:34,280
the Hornet and Task Force 18

452
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,680
departing from Alameda.

453
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,880
I'll meet you near Midway Island aboard the Enterprise

454
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,920
for the rendezvous.

455
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,440
Then under my command,

456
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:47,280
we'll merge as Task Force 16.

457
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,000
Task Force 16,

458
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,840
including 'Hornet' and 'Enterprise',

459
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:53,360
4 cruisers, 8 destroyers,

460
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,200
2 submarines and 2 tankers.

461
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:00,440
We need 18 days to cross the Pacific.

462
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:06,360
When we reach 400 miles east of Japan,

463
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,040
your B-25 bombers will take off.

464
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,680
Once you're airborne,

465
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,280
the task force will turn back to Hawaii.

466
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,880
You'll be on your own then.

467
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,440
Sir, we've been ready.

468
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,520
Let me emphasize one more thing.

469
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,520
This combined fleet

470
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,680
is all the naval power we have left after Pearl Harbor.

471
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,280
If we're discovered before

472
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,600
reaching the launch point,

473
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,560
the bombers will have to take off early

474
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,200
for Midway or Tokyo.

475
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,000
That way, 'Hornet's' deck

476
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,280
can be cleared for the fighters.

477
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:39,280
Protecting the ships is my primary concern.

478
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,120
Understood, sir.

479
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,200
One last thing.

480
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,880
We won't have lights at night.

481
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,080
The deck will be completely dark.

482
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,720
Take off after sunset.

483
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,480
Sir, we'll continue with the takeoff tests.

484
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,120
Jimmy, are you ready?

485
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,200
Yes, sir.

486
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,440
I'm excited

487
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,040
to see

488
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:03,100
what you can do with that big machine.

489
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:04,160
Jimmy.

490
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,480
Our mission depends on

491
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,320
whether you succeed today.

492
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,760
I certainly don't want to see you fail.

493
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,080
The aircraft has arrived on deck.

494
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:06,760
General,

495
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,120
let's wait and see.

496
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,080
7701 ready.

497
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,960
7701 cleared for takeoff.

498
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,200
Roger that.

499
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,040
Lieutenant Cole,

500
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:37,120
it's time to show what your training has accomplished.

501
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:37,650
Yes, sir.

502
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,440
Flaps down.

503
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,600
Full throttle.

504
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,600
Tower to 7701.

505
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,040
Copy that.

506
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,760
Prepare for takeoff.

507
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,240
Roger.

508
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:54,520
Ready. 7701 requesting takeoff.

509
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,560
Cleared for takeoff. Good luck.

510
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,200
We're on the deck.

511
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,120
With at least 30 yards to spare.

512
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,040
Unbelievable.

513
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,020
Jimmy, congratulations.

514
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:30,160
My fleet is at your disposal from now on.

515
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,850
Thank you, General.

516
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,960
Lieutenant Cole.

517
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,810
Take the plane back.

518
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:39,560
Yes, sir.

519
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,120
I'm Arnold.

520
00:33:58,840 --> 00:33:59,880
Hap, this is George Marshall.

521
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,960
I just saw the footage of the B-25s

522
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,490
taking off from the Hornet.

523
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,100
Doolittle did a great job.

524
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,480
I never doubted him, George.

525
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,760
Has the President seen the footage?

526
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:11,480
Yes, and he's very pleased.

527
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,239
He just gave final approval.

528
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:15,000
Any questions, Hap?

529
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:17,760
No.

530
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,239
Doolittle is the best,

531
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:22,199
though I hate putting him at risk.

532
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,280
But I trust he'll complete the mission.

533
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:27,719
Yes. Talk to you later.

534
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,719
I'll make you proud.

535
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,040
Looks good.

536
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,280
Why does the Commander

537
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,600
always host these Western-style parties?

538
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:14,920
Perhaps the Commander

539
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,380
enjoys this Western style of entertaining.

540
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,120
I see.

541
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,320
Country bumpkin.

542
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,000
When the Commander was at the New York consulate,

543
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,640
he attended these kinds of gatherings

544
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,120
and ate this type of food.

545
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,080
Colonel, the Commander is waiting for you.

546
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,560
Colonel.

547
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:47,920
Miss Ye.

548
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,250
Translator Luo.

549
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:51,560
Please wait.

550
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,560
I'll ask the Commander to come down.

551
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,360
Thank you for your hard work.

552
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:01,490
What are you looking at?

553
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,480
I grew up here as a child.

554
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,180
I know this place better than anyone.

555
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,360
As soon as I stepped in,

556
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,140
I felt the rage of having my home invaded.

557
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,200
It's like my shoes

558
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,220
are covered in dirt

559
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,770
and I don't know where to go.

560
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,920
I really want to set fire

561
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,520
and burn this place down.

562
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,560
Control your emotions.

563
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,840
Only then can you drive out

564
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,040
all the filth from your home.

565
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:33,360
There were countless parties here since I was little.

566
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,840
I never imagined

567
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,300
that I would be dressed like this,

568
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,880
coming to my own home

569
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:43,200
to attend a Japanese party.

570
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,620
Control yourself.

571
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,920
What perfect timing. Our main character has arrived.

572
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,120
Yes.

573
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:07,920
You must be Miss Ye.

574
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,520
Commander,

575
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,520
this is Miss Ye Biying.

576
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,360
Miss Ye,

577
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:17,040
I am Commander Fujita.

578
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,960
I am a friend of your father.

579
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,080
She is indeed beautiful.

580
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,560
The Colonel has good taste.

581
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:34,720
Your father and I are old friends.

582
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,600
Though we have different views on current affairs,

583
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,280
we share the same interests.

584
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,880
Tea ceremony, history... I respect him very much.

585
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,920
We both served as diplomats.

586
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,080
Your father was my senior.

587
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,380
He even let me have this place to live.

588
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,090
I'm very grateful for that.

589
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,160
I'm sure, Miss Ye,

590
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,690
you're very familiar with this place.

591
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:58,840
Please make yourself at home.

592
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,010

593
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:14,960

The Colonel is here

596

to carry out a very important mission.

597
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:27,440
If the Colonel requires cooperation from unit commanders,

598
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,500
please give him your full support. Understood?

599
