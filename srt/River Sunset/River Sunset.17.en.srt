1
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,280
Japanese invaders run rampant

2
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,920
violating our China.

3
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,440
Japanese invaders run rampant

4
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:03,000
violating our China.

5
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,520
The people of Sanzao

6
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,040
stand united as one.

7
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,400
The people of Sanzao

8
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,000
stand united as one.

9
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,600
We carry out heaven's justice

10
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,280
with eternal loyalty and righteousness.

11
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,600
We carry out heaven's justice

12
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,930
with eternal loyalty and righteousness.

13
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,040
Sir,

14
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,520
it's time.

15
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,860
Brother Erhu needs to depart now.

16
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,520
Don't worry, sir.

17
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,440
I'm off.

18
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,880
What part of Macao is this?

19
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,600
This street represents the lowest level of Macao society.

20
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,000
Due to the recent years of war and chaos,

21
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,040
beggars and prostitutes are everywhere,

22
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,840
along with refugees from all regions.

23
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,770
Please stay close to me, Director.

24
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,410
Thank you for your trouble.

25
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,560
Fa

26
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,320
Uncle Yi

27
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,959
This is...

28
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,480
Please wait.

29
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,480
Is the weather okay?

30
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,810
The weather is fine.

31
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,520
As long as we're on our way

32
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,440
and don't run into Japanese patrol boats,

33
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,320
we'll be safe.

34
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,409
Don't worry.

35
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,600
We're armed,

36
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:51,970
and besides,

37
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,840
Brother Geng gave us twenty extra bullets.

38
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,440
In two or three hours,

39
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,580
we should be there.

40
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,660
The wind is too strong.

41
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,960
Xiaohu, start the engine.

42
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,320
Let's speed up.

43
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:06,920
Okay.

44
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,340
What an honored guest!

45
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,090
Please come in quickly.

46
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,360
Please.

47
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,460
Director Shen.

48
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,280
Mr. Ye,

49
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,560
I've long admired you.

50
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,159
Director Shen.

51
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,080
In recent years, Anlantang

52
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,940
has had fewer dealings with government officials.

53
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,210
What a rare visitor!

54
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,159
I should have visited you long ago.

55
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:45,920
Come here!

56
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,000
For our first meeting,

57
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,840
a small gift.

58
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,840
Please accept it.

59
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,800
Wait for me outside.

60
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,290
As they say, don't accept rewards without merit.

61
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,920
Director Shen, coming so late,

62
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,250
you must have business.

63
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,520
I don't like beating around the bush.

64
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,320
Just tell me what's on your mind.

65
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,560
It's like this.

66
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,360
Recently,

67
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,640
you entrusted Wu Fa

68
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,120
with information about Sanzao Island for us.

69
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,120
We received it.

70
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,400
Mr. Dai insisted I express

71
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,760
his gratitude to you.

72
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,440
No need to thank me.

73
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:28,960
Come.

74
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,890
Please sit down.

75
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,640
The news from the island.

76
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,560
I'm just following my brother's orders

77
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,600
and doing as instructed.

78
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,920
I've long known about the deep bond between you brothers.

79
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,159
Admirable.

80
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:48,760
Do you see that street ahead?

81
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,720
Huawangtang Street.

82
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,420
The infamous coolie trade street back then.

83
00:06:54,159 --> 00:06:55,880
There were over 300 establishments

84
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,409
selling Chinese laborers along that street.

85
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,040
In Macau at that time,

86
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,720
there were tens of thousands of foreigners

87
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,560
engaged in human trafficking.

88
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,200
They used all kinds of methods -

89
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,600
deception, kidnapping, whatever it took.

90
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,740
They forcibly sold and exported Chinese laborers.

91
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,800
Some died at sea.

92
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,240
Some were lucky enough to reach America.

93
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,320
As for me,

94
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,320
living was worse than death.

95
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,840
If it weren't for my brother

96
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,280
who secured an official position from the court

97
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,760
and then went to Honolulu,

98
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:29,000
we wouldn't be where we are today.

99
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,440
Mr. Ye, this is what they call

100
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,880
surviving a calamity brings good fortune.

101
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,960
Don't you have a niece

102
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,560
named Ye Biying?

103
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,400
How do you know about her?

104
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,240
She works for us.

105
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,140
Working for the Military Intelligence?

106
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,850
Our family doesn't need money.

107
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,480
She shouldn't be doing such dangerous work.

108
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,440
Mr. Ye,

109
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,680
you're mistaken.

110
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,320
Miss Ye is serving her country

111
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,000
in these difficult times.

112
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,680
That year, my brother and I

113
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,080
carried her in one arm

114
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,960
and held Xia'er with the other hand

115
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,240
as we returned from Hawaii to the island.

116
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Recently,

117
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,880
I just sent her to Sanzao Island.

118
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,280
She's now with her father,

119
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,000
Ye Degong.

120
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,240
I heard you have a mission

121
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,240
to send someone tonight

122
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,480
to bring them back.

123
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,730
How did you know about this?

124
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,520
Is it tonight?

125
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,799
What are you trying to do?

126
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,880
Let me be honest with you.

127
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,410
The purpose of my visit to Macau

128
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,400
is to ask you

129
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,680
if you're confident

130
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,800
about this plan.

131
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,440
Then I'll be honest with you too.

132
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,280
For my family and my niece,

133
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,320
I would do anything.

134
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,680
Mr. Ye,

135
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,520
you misunderstand.

136
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,760
Like you,

137
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,080
I want them to evacuate safely.

138
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:08,840
Then why

139
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,170
are you questioning me?

140
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,400
I just have three questions.

141
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,400
First,

142
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,200
for this operation,

143
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,840
do you have a detailed plan?

144
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:18,980
Second,

145
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,960
before taking action,

146
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,520
have you conducted thorough reconnaissance?

147
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,240
Third, if the mission fails,

148
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,760
what's your backup plan?

149
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,490
We've done everything necessary.

150
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:31,920
Director Shen,

151
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,400
if you have any objections,

152
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,120
I'm afraid it's too late.

153
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,960
Because the people going to pick them up

154
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,160
have already left.

155
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:45,440
And now

156
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,040
they should be meeting soon.

157
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,840
I'm here.

158
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,320
Remember what I told you.

159
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,600
Today is the last quarter moon.

160
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,800
After midnight,

161
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,800
the tide will rise 30 to 50 meters.

162
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,480
When that happens, release this

163
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,840
and push the car directly into the sea.

164
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,970
Remember to wipe away the tire tracks.

165
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:27,200
Tomorrow morning, the Japanese will organize people

166
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,060
to search for us in large numbers.

167
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,240
By then, we can

168
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,440
gain an extra day

169
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,400
to leave Macau.

170
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,680
Then we'll be safe.

171
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,760
Don't touch anything in the car.

172
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,960
Push everything into the sea together.

173
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,800
When you get home tomorrow,

174
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,040
if they come asking questions,

175
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,040
remember this:

176
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:42,720
say that yesterday afternoon,

177
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,000
we left home together

178
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,290
and never came back.

179
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:46,840
Okay.

180
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,320
The Major should be here soon.

181
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,080
Let's go.

182
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,760
Mr. Ye.

183
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,560
I know you have another way

184
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,760
to contact Sanzao Island.

185
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,320
Could you notify them right now

186
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,520
to abort the mission?

187
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,080
You must be mistaken.

188
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,440
I have no way

189
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,560
to contact the island.

190
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,720
Then we can only leave it to fate.

191
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:16,080
May I stay with you

192
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,560
while we await the news?

193
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:44,800
He's here.

194
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,320
Major.

195
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,700
How's your wound? Can you hold on?

196
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,480
Why is he here?

197
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,040
He agreed to help us.

198
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,560
Mr. Wumu.

199
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,760
I know this decision was difficult for you.

200
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,740
Thank you very much for your assistance.

201
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,100
Let's not talk about this now.

202
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:17,240
We'll discuss everything after we get out safely.

203
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,720
Find a place to hide first.

204
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,120
It's too dangerous here.

205
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,720
Longxia,

206
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,680
go keep watch over there.

207
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,340
Tell us when the boat arrives.

208
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,760
Wait in the back for a moment.

209
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,740
This is our Sanzao Island.

210
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,720
This is Macau.

211
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,880
This island is called Dahengqin Island.

212
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,880
It's our necessary route to Macau.

213
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,640
This is also the territory

214
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,480
of the Navy's Sixth Air Base.

215
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,000
There are two naval battalions on this island

216
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,730
and one naval garrison regiment stationed here.

217
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,450
Is someone meeting us in Macau?

218
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,400
There's a Nationalist Government Military Intelligence contact point in Macau.

219
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,920
I've already sent them a message,

220
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,160
but I haven't received their reply.

221
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,860
Although Macau is a neutral zone,

222
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,440
there are likely

223
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,320
many Japanese intelligence agencies there.

224
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,200
No matter what,

225
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,130
the situation is better than here.

226
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:14,840
After we arrive in Macau,

227
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,640
we need to find Anlan Hall first.

228
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:18,120
It will be much safer there.

229
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:18,720
Then we need to

230
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,400
contact the Nationalist Government as soon as possible,

231
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,720
hand you over to them,

232
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,160
and my mission will be complete.

233
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,440
That would be best.

234
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,520
I feel that

235
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:27,240
being discovered by the Japanese here

236
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,720
is just a matter of time.

237
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,650
There's another situation

238
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,960
I must warn both of you about.

239
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,200
If we

240
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,000
encounter any danger at sea,

241
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,440
whoever survives among us

242
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,960
needs to either deliver this intelligence

243
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,480
or destroy it.

244
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,640
So, Major,

245
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:50,400
I still hope you can

246
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,720
honestly tell us

247
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,420
what this intelligence is actually for.

248
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,520
All I can tell you is

249
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,960
if I die,

250
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,490
many people won't find their way home.

251
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,880
So,

252
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:13,880
this intelligence

253
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,120
really is related to America's retaliation

254
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:18,250
after Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor?

255
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,680
Xiaohu,

256
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:23,800
turn off the engine

257
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,060
and come here quickly.

258
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,240
What's wrong?

259
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,600
We're not far from Sanzao now.

260
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,930
Let's row the boat over.

261
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:38,800
Hurry.

262
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,040
I can see Sanzao.

263
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,840
That's right.

264
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,080
It's Sanzao.

265
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:01,280
Xiaohu.

266
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:02,440
Give me the flashlight quickly.

267
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,280
Okay.

268
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:26,280
It's them.

269
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,640
Quick, Xiaohu.

270
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,640
Row faster.

271
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,770
They're coming.

272
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,360
We can just avoid them.

273
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,720
Japanese patrol boat.

274
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,520
They're gone.

275
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,240
Dahu.

276
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,640
Young Master.

277
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:04,600
Young Master.

278
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,560
Dahu, why are there Japanese here?

279
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,000
Don't worry.

280
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,130
They're on our side.

281
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,520
This is Wumu.

282
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,960
This is Major Weite.

283
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:12,920
Dahu and Xiaohu are both our people.

284
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,180
Young Master, Miss Ye.

285
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,720
Their families were all killed by the Japanese.

286
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,360
Now they work for my uncle.

287
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,800
Uncle Geng asked us to come quickly.

288
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,680
Probably something happened to Uncle Ye.

289
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,600
It's fine.

290
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:26,680
Did you encounter

291
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,040
any Japanese patrol boats at sea?

292
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:28,800
No.

293
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,240
How long does it take from Macau to here?

294
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,600
About three hours.

295
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:32,840
Dahu.

296
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,040
This matter is very important.

297
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,120
You must safely

298
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,320
take them to my uncle.

299
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:37,640
Understood.

300
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:38,440
Young Master.

301
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,120
Let's go then.

302
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,440
We shouldn't stay here long.

303
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,080
Let's go.

304
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,360
Please take care of my father.

305
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,090
Don't worry.

306
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:48,800
Young Master.

307
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,720
Aren't you coming?

308
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:50,360
I'm not leaving.

309
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,220
I need to stay here with my father.

310
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,600
Then, Young Master,

311
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:56,730
I have a favor to ask.

312
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,960
Qingming Festival is coming soon.

313
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,160
On that day,

314
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,360
please go to the mountain

315
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:03,080
and burn some paper money for our parents.

316
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:03,800
Tell them

317
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,160
Xiaohu and I are at Uncle Geng's place

318
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:05,839
and doing well.

319
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:06,520
Don't worry.

320
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,650
I'll take care of it.

321
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,119
Thank you, Young Master.

322
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,960
Take care.

323
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,200
Take care.

324
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:12,040
Let's go.

325
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,640
Where have you been all these years?

326
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,700
Have you been well?

327
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,840
It's a long story.

328
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,320
I'll tell you later.

329
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,050
How is everyone at home?

330
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,000
All good.

331
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,000
What about Uncle Ye?

332
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,160
How is his health?

333
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,600
Do you hear an engine sound?

334
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,360
Miss.

335
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,160
It's a Japanese patrol boat.

336
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,840
It seems to be coming from that direction.

337
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:54,720
Patrol boat?

338
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,640
Didn't you say they only come once every half hour?

339
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,480
Xiaohu.

340
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,920
Turn the boat around and start the engine.

341
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,720
No.

342
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:00,930
There's no time.

343
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
It's too risky.

344
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,280
They'll catch up with us soon.

345
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,360
None of us will escape.

346
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,360
What should we do?

347
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,640
Abandon ship.

348
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:13,640
Get in the water.

349
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,920
What are you doing?

350
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,000
Miss,

351
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,880
we can't leave.

352
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:27,960
If we all leave,

353
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,560
when the enemy arrives,

354
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:30,200
they'll definitely search underwater.

355
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,520
If we leave, we leave together.

356
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,240
Miss,

357
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,320
you go first.

358
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,120
Hurry and go.

359
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,320
Don't worry about us.

360
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,920
Someone's over there.

361
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:45,320
Xiaohu.

362
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:45,800
You go too.

363
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,060
Brother, you go first.

364
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:50,760
Go!

365
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,040
Brother, go now!

366
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,280
Hurry!

367
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:01,080
What happened?

368
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,040
What's going on?

369
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:03,760
The patrol boat came early.

370
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,960
The car wasn't pushed in, was it?

371
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,680
Not yet.

372
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:07,520
We need to leave quickly.

373
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,480
The police squad will soon

374
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:09,810
block off this sea area.

375
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,740
Where are Dahu and Xiaohu?

376
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,720
They could have left the boat,

377
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,760
but they didn't.

378
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,440
It was for us,

379
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,840
to buy us more time.

380
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,580
If you don't leave now,

381
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,520
their sacrifice will be in vain.

382
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:24,760
Go!

383
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,960
Put him down first.

384
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,280
Major.

385
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:44,800
His breathing is rapid.

386
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,920
He might have broken ribs

387
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,880
that punctured his organs causing internal bleeding.

388
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:48,680
We need to find a place immediately

389
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,080
to examine him properly.

390
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,410
Get in the car first.

391
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,680
Patrol boat unit reporting.

392
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,240
Yes.

393
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,120
We intercepted a small boat

394
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,640
smuggling people in Jinwan waters.

395
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,280
Two people were killed.

396
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,680
The patrol boat unit requests

397
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:33,210
that you send someone over.

398
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,680
Be more specific.

399
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,640
Was it one of our island's fishing boats

400
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,120
trying to smuggle out?

401
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,760
No.

402
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,360
The patrol boat crew says

403
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,520
it appears to be a boat from Macau.

404
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,520
It had already infiltrated the base

405
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:51,160
and was discovered while leaving.

406
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,760
There was also a small firefight.

407
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,810
Understood. We'll be right there.

408
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,480
Report.

409
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,240
Notify Lieutenant Sasaki

410
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:06,960
to come with me

411
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,890
to the naval patrol boat unit dock.

412
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:23,440
Inoue.

413
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:23,760
Yes.

414
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,600
Take men immediately and seal off

415
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,840
the Jinwan area coastline.

416
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:26,320
Sasaki.

417
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,200
Have your team follow me.

418
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,320
Move out.

419
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,480
Yes.

420
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,160
Come.

421
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,360
Over here.

422
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,640
Where is the secret room?

423
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,520
It's here.

424
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,040
Right here.

425
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,800
Go bring the Major and Biying in.

426
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,520
Okay.

427
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,120
Be careful.

428
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:12,810
Take it slow.

429
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,320
Lift the table up.

430
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,560
Let me do it.

431
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:27,560
Put him on it.

432
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,200
Move down a bit.

433
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,530
One, two, three.

434
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:48,000
Bear with it.

435
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,080
His ribs were already fractured.

436
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:52,760
This movement

437
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,400
has caused him tremendous pain.

438
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,530
Chest pain causes shallow breathing.

439
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,800
Once secretions build up in the airways,

440
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,200
it can lead to lung infection

441
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,240
or atelectasis.

442
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,760
So what do we do now?

443
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:03,800
But my current assessment is

444
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:04,640
what's more serious is

445
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,320
his ribs have already

446
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,600
punctured his pleura,

447
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,040
causing intercostal bleeding

448
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,320
resulting in hemothorax and pneumothorax.

449
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,440
So I'm asking, what do we do now?

450
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,170
I need to operate immediately.

451
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,780
This is all I have in my car now.

452
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,760
It has everything we need.

453
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,020
Do you have any tubing?

454
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,560
I need a tube.

455
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,680
Will this work?

456
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,450
Sterilize it with fire.

457
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,280
I'm making the incision now.

458
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,560
Hold on.

459
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,680
The tube.

460
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:49,920
Help me find

461
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:50,560
a basin.

462
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:53,840
Hold him down.

463
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:54,900
Don't let him move.

464
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:55,980
Keep him still.

465
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,400
Just put it below.

466
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,720
Bear with it.

467
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:00,480
Weite.

468
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:01,200
Hang in there.

469
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:01,960
Stay strong.

470
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:13,920
Vito.

471
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,080
Vito.

472
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,800
He passed out.

473
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:29,200
What do we do now?

474
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,000
Wait a moment.

475
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:35,960
Vito.

476
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,040
Vito.

477
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,770
That's about it.

478
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,980
I need to stitch him up.

479
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,340
Hold the light steady.

480
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,080
Come here.

481
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,140
Shine it over here.

482
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,080
Do you have scissors?

483
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,520
Cut it here.

484
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,000
Wait.

485
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:42,040
Is it over?

486
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,640
It's over.

487
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,640
We need to leave quickly.

488
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,900
Oshima Hiroshi could arrive any moment.

489
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:48,720
Longxia,

490
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,720
you're in charge of cleaning up here.

491
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,760
I'm leaving this to you.

492
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:52,160
Okay.

493
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:53,930
The flashlight,

494
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,050
take it with you.

495
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,080
Let's go.

496
00:30:59,640 --> 00:30:59,880
Let's go.

497
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,360
Be careful.

498
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:00,920
Okay.

499
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,080
Captain,

500
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,690
these two aren't from the village.

501
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,840
They must be from Macau.

502
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,520
Search them carefully.

503
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,200
There's nothing

504
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,920
to identify them.

505
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:11,480
Why do you think

506
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,340
they risked coming to the island?

507
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,240
They used to come frequently years ago,

508
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,370
but haven't been here in recent years.

509
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:20,720
They might come back again in the future.

510
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,200
Also,

511
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,960
the sentry who disappeared from the garrison a few days ago,

512
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,240
could these two be connected to that?

513
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,730
Do you think they have accomplices on the island?

514
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,240
These troublemakers are unpredictable,

515
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,200
their connections with Macau are complicated.

516
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,320
Were they targeting this island specifically

517
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,320
or

518
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,360
just passing through?

519
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,080
That's still unclear at this point.

520
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,080
At dawn, hang their bodies

521
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,200
at the entrance of Tanjiawan village,

522
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,960
on the tree in front of the ancestral hall.

523
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,090
Let them see what happens to these two.

524
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,440
That American who landed on the island

525
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,840
still hasn't been found.

526
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,360
We only suspect

527
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,840
he's being hidden somewhere around Caotang Mountain.

528
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,440
Could these two coming to the island

529
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,800
be related to that incident?

530
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,480
There are some coincidences,

531
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,120
but it's hard to say for sure.

532
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,840
What about the Colonel's woman?

533
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,120
What is she doing now,

534
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,760
do you know?

535
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,720
Please relay my message to Captain Oshima Hiroshi.

536
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,520
Yes, sir.

537
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,680
Report, sir.

538
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,520
Captain,

539
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,440
Ye Biying and Major Wumu

540
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,700
have returned to the barracks together.

541
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,200
You may go.

542
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,000
What were they doing out so late?

543
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,690
Probably doing things they enjoy.

544
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,040
I suppose so.

545
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:57,600
They

546
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:01,120
really had a romantic time at the beach today.

547
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,000
Yes.

548
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,840
We need to investigate those two.

549
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:13,639
Sasaki,

550
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:15,300
send someone to check on them.

551
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:18,480
No,

552
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:20,600
I'll go myself.

553
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,920
Today's incident

554
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,179
was really dangerous.

555
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,780
Let's not talk about this now.

556
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,240
I'm really sorry.

557
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,080
I don't know how

558
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:02,680
things turned out like this.

559
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,400
They're here so soon.

560
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,040
Captain.

561
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,560
The Colonel and that woman just returned.

562
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:24,000
But it was too dark in the car.

563
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,480
I couldn't see clearly.

564
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,600
Dismissed.

565
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,920
Everyone to your positions.

566
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:44,840
Sasaki,

567
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:45,970
go knock on the door.

568
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,760
Who is it?

569
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,240
I'm Sasaki from the police unit.

570
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,640
What brings you here so late?

571
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,360
There's an emergency.

572
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,280
Colonel.

573
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,800
What kind of emergency

574
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,400
that can't wait until morning?

575
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,400
According to the coastal patrol unit,

576
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,560
assassins have been spotted infiltrating by sea.

577
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,480
Captain Oshima is concerned about your safety

578
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:42,740
and wants me to assign two more guards for your protection.

579
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,240
Just a moment.

580
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:47,640
Colonel.

581
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,220
I'm very sorry to disturb you so late.

582
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,520
Someone has landed on the island from Macau.

583
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:55,400
We're searching this area now.

584
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,920
Close the door.

585
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,720
Talk outside.

586
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:01,920
Excuse me.

587
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,880
I don't really understand women.

588
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,800
How's your wife doing?

589
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:37,760
She's fine.

590
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,520
I really envy you.

591
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,800
And your daughter?

592
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,520
What are those two doing?

593
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,360
Good thing I never got married.

594
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,880
What kind of assassins

595
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,940
could make even the barracks unsafe?

596
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,480
Several years ago,

597
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,280
a major at our base

598
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,560
was killed by an assassin's bullet.

599
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,440
If something happens to you at the base,

600
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:34,240
we wouldn't be able

601
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,970
to explain it to headquarters.

602
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,520
Fine.

603
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,370
I appreciate your concern.

604
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,040
But one or two assassins,

605
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,440
I can handle them myself.

606
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,440
But Colonel...

607
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,560
Didn't your men report to you today?

608
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,560
Miss Ye and I had an argument at the beach.

609
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,840
She lost her temper with me.

610
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,400
I just managed to calm her down.

611
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,800
Then you all showed up.

612
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,200
Should I call Commander Fujita

613
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,000
on the phone?

614
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,720
Tell him

615
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,640
you've been watching my girlfriend,

616
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,320
or rather,

617
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,380
that I was your real target all along?

618
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:06,880
No, no.

619
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,000
Just routine procedure.

620
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,200
I truly apologize.

621
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,880
In a few days, please allow me to host a dinner for you

622
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:13,280
to express my apologies.

623
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:15,960
It's fine.

624
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,120
You've all been busy all night.

625
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,280
Get some rest.

626
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:20,920
Yes, sir.

627
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,000
We'll take our leave.

628
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:42,480
They're all gone.

629
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,560
Gone.

630
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,520
It seems

631
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:55,000
I can't leave tonight either,

632
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:55,840
can I?

633
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,120
You sleep inside.

634
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,530
I'll sleep outside.

635
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,640
Sir,

636
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,760
have some tea.

637
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,440
Sir.

638
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:11,800
Xia'er,

639
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,560
how is it?

640
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:12,960
Something's wrong!

641
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,840
Something happened.

642
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,600
What happened?

643
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,260
We encountered a patrol boat.

644
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:18,240
Where is your sister?

645
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:18,920
She's fine.

646
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,120
She's with Wumu now.

647
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,580
Where's the Major?

648
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,280
We moved the Major to the Reading Hall.

649
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,610
He's slightly injured.

650
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,720
Ying'er performed surgery on him.

651
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,520
He was asleep when I ran back.

652
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:32,360
He should be fine too.

653
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,920
Thank goodness.

654
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,320
The ones from Macau

655
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,560
were the Tiger brothers.

656
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,040
They...

657
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,640
They're all dead.

658
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,920
How could this

659
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,000
happen?

660
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:06,760
How is this possible?

661
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,360
Was our information leaked?

662
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,720
I don't know either.

663
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,880
Their boat had just left

664
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,600
when they encountered a Japanese patrol boat.

665
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:16,120
Later I heard intense gunfire.

666
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,840
Then Ying'er and Wumu

667
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,720
swam back supporting the Major.

668
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,480
But they couldn't escape.

669
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:27,200
Your uncle must be worried sick.

670
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,680
Hurry,

671
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:29,960
send him a message.

672
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:32,920
