1
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,800
When she went back to the island,

2
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,880
she had a gun with her.

3
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,920
and got caught by us.

4
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,160
Fukuda found out about this.

5
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,160
I know that too.

6
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:43,280
One of our senior officers

7
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,920
to get a gun for her lover.

8
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:48,400
There's nothing to be surprised about.

9
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,800
Anything else?

10
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,600
According to the investigation on the well,

11
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,800
we found that there were

12
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,240
all her clothes and accessories

13
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,240
are not in line with her identity.

14
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,720
Commander.

15
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,320
This is like a spy.

16
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,240
With these?

17
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,400
Are you sure

18
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,080
the Colonel brought is a spy?

19
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,880
I dare not.

20
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,560
This woman is marked as a dancer.

21
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,320
But she lacks that kind of dancer.

22
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,040
She's so passionate.

23
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,400
Yes.

24
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,640
a noble lady.

25
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,960
I know what you want to say.

26
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,960
Lord Ye was a diplomat in the previous dynasty.

27
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,400
His daughter should have

28
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,000
a noble lady.

29
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,400
I couldn't survive in Shanghai.

30
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:39,160
I became a backup dancer.

31
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,400
This is also forced by life.

32
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,240
Back to the island,

33
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,520
This woman met her father.

34
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,600
The passion of the dancers you mentioned

35
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,520
I can’t even hide them.

36
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,160
But Commander,

37
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,760
Do you know

38
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,360
Do you know what that means?

39
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,120
Innocent?

40
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,080
The diplomat

41
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,680
know the First Law.

42
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,320
Everyone will pay special attention

43
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,320
his first impression.

44
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,360
This kind of impression is hard to change.

45
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,400
The first information you got

46
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:22,120
was this woman came to the island with a gun.

47
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,360
So your first impression was

48
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,600
this woman was a spy.

49
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:26,560
So,

50
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,200
you must have spent a lot of time

51
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,600
to find more reasons.

52
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,120
But Commander,

53
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,520
Judging from her clothes,

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,520
the Special Forces Police Brigade

55
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,640
You don't study women's clothes all day.

56
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,040
posture, body talk and dress all day?

57
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,920
I know about Colonel.

58
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,520
But that woman is Chinese.

59
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,000
If you trust her completely,

60
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
is very dangerous.

61
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,720
Besides,

62
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,760
if there's more than one reason

63
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,920
to come back to this island,

64
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,880
What else could it be?

65
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,760
I'm not sure yet.

66
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,640
But I don't think I should forget.

67
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,920
her father and Americans

68
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,160
related to the Americans.

69
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,000
Before we have solid evidence,

70
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,320
all your deductions

71
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,480
is just a wishful doubt.

72
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,040
I'll take a look.

73
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:24,480
Don't make any trouble.

74
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,159
Kewen.

75
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,280
What are you playing?

76
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:38,920
Here.

77
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,560
Give it to me.

78
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,120
This one.

79
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,720
Look at this.

80
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,320
Kewen, I have something for you.

81
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,280
I'll change it with you.

82
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,600
I'll change this with you.

83
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,720
Look.

84
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,400
American lighter.

85
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,560
[The Major's belongings.]

86
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,560
Get in.

87
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:30,680
Get in.

88
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,560
There's a tail.

89
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,720
Are you thinking

90
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:53,840
why I have to take special care of Lord Ye De?

91
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,400
Our Great Japan Empire

92
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,520
is basically a island

93
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,480
of a single nation.

94
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,720
Other than the tribe,

95
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,560
it's hard for other countries to establish a foothold.

96
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,160
But it's different here.

97
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,360
This place

98
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,800
is famous for its expansion overseas.

99
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,520
They are Chinese.

100
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,600
After Ming Qing, many people went to Nanyang

101
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,840
and traveled far away to do business or settle down.

102
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,600
Ye De Gong is the most

103
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,760
among them.

104
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,400
He was a diplomat.

105
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,520
He was a businessman.

106
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:25,120
They can create new situations

107
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,160
in Hawaii.

108
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:31,520
If such a person can be used by us,

109
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,600
Violence won't

110
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,320
violence won't make him surrender.

111
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,920
Only by subduing him mentally

112
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,280
can we really rule him.

113
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,880
As long as the chief of the island is ruled,

114
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,920
the people on this island

115
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:46,840
willingly

116
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:47,920
the foot of our Japanese Empire.

117
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,400
Do you understand?

118
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,280
Check.

119
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:51,640
Got it.

120
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,200
Oshima!

121
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,640
I don't doubt your ability.

122
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,040
If you insist,

123
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,800
we have to investigate what we should.

124
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,000
But

125
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,760
Pay attention to the way.

126
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,520
Thank you.

127
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:16,320
Excuse me.

128
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,000
Find Lieutenant Sakamoto

129
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
and find out what the mission is

130
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,920
to the island.

131
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,320
Don't alert the commander.

132
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,840
Irigami.

133
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,520
Yes.

134
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,480
Colonel and that woman.

135
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,159
What do you think?

136
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:47,120
Don't you think they're unusual?

137
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,360
That arrogant guy.

138
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,520
Why did you come to the island?

139
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,040
Commander didn’t tell you?

140
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:56,720
No.

141
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,000
He didn't say anything.

142
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,520
It must be something.

143
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,120
A few days ago,

144
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,560
we shot down a American plane.

145
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,880
Then a American

146
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,000
landed on the island.

147
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,640
At that moment,

148
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,880
Colonel and that woman went to the island.

149
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:18,400
Is there any connection?

150
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,600
I've been thinking about it.

151
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,040
There's no direct evidence yet,

152
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:22,320
that there is an inevitable connection

153
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,040
between these two things.

154
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:33,760
I think something big is going to happen on the island.

155
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,360
Let's do our best to find

156
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,480
the American.

157
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,520
If they really came to the island

158
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,360
for this,

159
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,600
As long as we have that American,

160
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:49,200
he will come to us.

161
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,560
To drive him crazy, we must destroy him first.

162
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,680
If we know

163
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,000
the real purpose of Colonel,

164
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:01,920
the colonel will go crazy.

165
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,320
In this case,

166
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,640
we have the initiative.

167
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,320
Yes.

168
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:08,920
Captain.

169
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:12,960
What you said about destruction and madness.

170
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,240
The order is upside down.

171
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,040
Open the rail.

172
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,240
I want to see your captain.

173
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,160
Colonel.

174
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,560
Our captain is not here.

175
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,880
Where did he go?

176
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,760
Our captain and vice-captain

177
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,280
went to Fukuda Tavern.

178
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,200
Okay.

179
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,400
Do you want to

180
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,680
should we investigate it?

181
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,320
Captain.

182
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,680
Don't mind it.

183
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,520
I'm sorry.

184
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:50,960
Captain.

185
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,280
None of your business.

186
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,920
I know.

187
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,800
It's just a mistake.

188
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,040
Investigate Tang Ju.

189
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:07,080
Mind your words and actions.

190
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,160
Tang Bingchen is still useful to us.

191
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,760
Take care of yourself.

192
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,240
Yes, sir.

193
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:18,880
Captain.

194
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:23,640
That idiot's lighter

195
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,720
was caught by Colonel Takemici.

196
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,200
Colonel.

197
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,160
This is...

198
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,480
American lighter.

199
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,680
Captain Oshima, sit down.

200
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:40,520
Captain Oshima

201
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,800
Haven't you been looking for that American?

202
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,880
My assistant Ye Bi-ying.

203
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,360
found this thing

204
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,800
on Kewen today.

205
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,560
Did Miss Ye find it by accident?

206
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,960
She has known Kewen since childhood.

207
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,360
We grew up together.

208
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,160
Why

209
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,680
on Kewen?

210
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,520
You should investigate this.

211
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,000
I just know this

212
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,160
might help you.

213
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,840
so I brought it here for you.

214
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,560
Irigami, pour some wine for Colonel.

215
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,120
No.

216
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,960
Miss Ye is waiting for me outside.

217
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:16,240
I should go now.

218
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,880
Thank you.

219
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,360
Colonel.

220
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,680
I want to kindly remind you

221
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,520
Be careful of the woman beside you.

222
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,240
What does he mean?

223
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,360
What was that?

224
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,760
The colonel's woman took the lighter.

225
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,360
It's okay. Go down.

226
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,800
Don't be nervous.

227
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,400
No one will follow us today.

228
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,160
Because

229
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,280
we gave the lighter to Oshima Hao

230
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,040
and let his guard down on us.

231
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,920
That's half right.

232
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,560
Before we came to the island,

233
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,560
they already suspected your father.

234
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:55,360
So,

235
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,640
some things are inevitable.

236
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,360
What we can do now

237
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,000
is to try our best to avoid mistakes.

238
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,760
How do we go?

239
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,280
Turn left at the intersection ahead.

240
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,800
The village was slaughtered too.

241
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,400
I guess there's only a house left.

242
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,000
There's no one left.

243
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,920
What's wrong?

244
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,880
I want you to remember what I said.

245
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,240
From now on, don't be emotional.

246
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,080
Try to think rationally

247
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:52,960
in a rational way.

248
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,200
What do you mean?

249
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,480
Just remember it.

250
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:58,920
Nothing.

251
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,280
That cave is right ahead.

252
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,960
It's right ahead.

253
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,160
It's here.

254
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,040
I told you

255
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,320
It's big inside, isn't it?

256
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,400
Major Wilt.

257
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,840
I'm Ye Bi Ying, the daughter of Lord Ye De.

258
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,800
My father told me

259
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,720
you were here.

260
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:25,240
We're coming in.

261
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,280
Is there only one way?

262
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:31,640
Stand behind me.

263
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,160
Will.

264
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,839
We're here to rescue you.

265
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,280
My mission

266
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:14,079
is to bring you and your belongings

267
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,520
to a safe place.

268
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,520
Are you Japanese?

269
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,280
I'm Ichiro Takemichi.

270
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,600
We're here specially for you.

271
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,840
Major Wilt.

272
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,200
Sam greets you.

273
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,920
I heard from my father that you're injured.

274
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,840
I studied medicine.

275
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,320
Let me check it for you.

276
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,600
I'll touch your body later.

277
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,480
Don't be nervous.

278
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,880
Take a deep breath in cooperation.

279
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,080
Wait.

280
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,520
Okay.

281
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,480
Take a deep breath. Slow down.

282
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,360
I think the ribs are broken.

283
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,600
It's not appropriate to make a big move.

284
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,640
If you stab your lungs,

285
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,000
it'll cause hemopneumothorax.

286
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,720
Keep an eye on the door.

287
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,800
I have something to say to Major Wilt.

288
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:39,960
There's some food here.

289
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,000
You guys talk first.

290
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,720
I basically understand the situation on this island.

291
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,880
I need to leave as soon as possible.

292
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,840
Do you have any plans?

293
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:25,760
When are you leaving?

294
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,120
You're in danger.

295
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,760
You could be caught anytime.

296
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,760
And I didn't expect you to be so badly injured.

297
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,880
I couldn't move.

298
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,720
So I can think of

299
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,720
the safest way.

300
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,000
Give me the information.

301
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,840
I'll leave the island as soon as possible.

302
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,360
That's impossible.

303
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,480
Maybe I didn't make it clear to you.

304
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,840
I'll tell you slowly.

305
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,800
Major Wilt.

306
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:53,720
Your mission

307
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,080
is to hand over the information to the National Government.

308
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,360
My mission

309
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,240
is to get information from you

310
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,320
to the National Government.

311
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,320
So our mission is the same.

312
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,960
There's no difference between us.

313
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,400
Give me the information.

314
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,480
I'll send it to the National Government.

315
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,080
our mission

316
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,200
is done.

317
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,080
Okay?

318
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,000
In other words,

319
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,080
our existence

320
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,520
to complete this mission.

321
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,400
You are a soldier.

322
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,560
I'm also a soldier.

323
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,200
I hope you can understand

324
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:35,800
I hope you can understand

325
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,560
and accept your mission.

326
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:38,840
I understand

327
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,560
and my mission.

328
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,840
So I

329
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,120
to deliver the information myself.

330
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,880
Do you understand?

331
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,640
You take yourself too seriously.

332
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:51,720
If the information

333
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,880
from you,

334
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:53,840
they will send

335
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,200
to China.

336
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,600
The longer you waste here,

337
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,120
the lower your value will be.

338
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,320
Do you understand?

339
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,360
The current situation of China

340
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,480
The second believer

341
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,960
is basically impossible to get there safely.

342
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,760
The only thing you need to do now

343
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,040
is to get me out safely.

344
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,240
I can tell you

345
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,480
In my authorization,

346
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,920
I have the right to decide

347
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:20,080
based on the information.

348
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,600
So even if you don't give me the information,

349
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,400
I need you

350
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,040
to me.

351
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,480
Before April 19th,

352
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,000
If I didn't

353
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,120
deliver this information safely,

354
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,920
will affect the whole plan.

355
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,560
Not enough.

356
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,200
This plan concerns

357
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,520
even the whole world.

358
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,400
is more important than our lives.

359
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,240
That's all I can tell you.

360
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,320
I have to tell you

361
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:13,200
In my authorization,

362
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,200
I have the right

363
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,240
not you.

364
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,040
Ichiro Takemuki, put down your gun!

365
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,760
How could you do this?

366
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,720
You sent me away just to kill me.

367
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,560
Put the gun down.

368
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,000
Or I'll really shoot.

369
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:34,400
Put it down.

370
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,960
Miss Ye.

371
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,800
Miss Ye.

372
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,040
Don't be nervous.

373
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,040
Your friend won't kill me yet.

374
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,320
Because he knows

375
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:49,960
he can't

376
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,480
to the National Government.

377
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,240
Why didn't you get the information?

378
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,720
and let the believer die.

379
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,480
right?

380
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,040
It's not safe here now.

381
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,760
But you need to hide here for a few days.

382
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,480
I'll find you

383
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,880
a safer place for you.

384
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,080
There's food in the bag.

385
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,800
I'll be back tomorrow.

386
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,640
I'll get you a Japanese military uniform.

387
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,960
It's easier to move.

388
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,000
You'd better remember what I said.

389
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,200
Don't pull your gun

390
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,480
don't pull out your gun.

391
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,040
Even if you do,

392
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:40,880
remember two things.

393
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:42,520
First,

394
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,280
Are you sure the gun is pointing to your enemy?

395
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,320
Second,

396
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,200
Turn on the insurance before you shoot.

397
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,480
Will.

398
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,080
No one wants to detonate it.

399
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,800
I'll bring you some medicine.

400
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,800
Eat something and take a rest.

401
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,840
Okay, I understand.

402
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,080
I'll tell him.

403
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,400
Major.

404
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,840
The front line of Myanmar

405
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,040
may disappoint you.

406
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,240
How's the situation at the front line?

407
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,640
Yesterday,

408
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,800
more than 200 Japanese airplanes

409
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:20,080
attacked Ma Gyu Airport in La Xu.

410
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,240
The British air force and American volunteer team

411
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,160
at the airport.

412
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,760
was caught off guard.

413
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,560
We lost a lot.

414
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:26,080
That means...

415
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,240
I still can't move.

416
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,120
Really?

417
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:31,320
Either

418
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,400
to fly over Himalayas

419
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,320
or be beaten down by the Japanese.

420
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:38,200
We've lost a believer.

421
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,360
I don't want anything to happen to you again.

422
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:43,360
Time is running out.

423
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:45,240
Give me a few more days, Major.

424
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,360
Things are getting better.

425
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,840
I'll arrange it right away.

426
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,280
Go ahead.

427
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,680
If you shoot him to death,

428
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:00,480
will you shoot me to death?

429
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,040
I've found the messenger for you

430
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,040
and complete our mission.

431
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,520
I'm no longer useful to you.

432
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,520
Am I right?

433
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,520
Tell me.

434
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,480
Is it more convenient for you

435
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,560
after you kill me?

436
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,360
I never kill pretty women.

437
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:19,600
Can you be serious?

438
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,560
I'm quite serious.

439
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,480
Why not?

440
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,520
I'm not serious because I said you're pretty.

441
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,560
I'm serious when I say you're ugly.

442
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,480
Can you calm down?

443
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,320
Calm down.

444
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,040
In front of me,

445
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,160
in front of me.

446
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,000
How can I calm down?

447
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,160
I didn't want to kill him.

448
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,520
I just wanted to scare him.

449
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,280
I didn't get any information.

450
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:33,480
Why should I kill him?

451
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,200
So you'll kill him if you get the information.

452
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:37,600
You said it.

453
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:39,600
Cold-blooded.

454
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,360
and inhumane.

455
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:42,880
Cold-blooded.

456
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,600
When did I say that?

457
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,360
Why did you hit me?

458
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,200
You're not serious.

459
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,200
If I didn't help you,

460
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:54,840
if I didn't help you?

461
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,200
Why are you being serious again?

462
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,560
Fine, I'll be serious with you.

463
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:00,480
We've found the messenger.

464
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:00,880
right?

465
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:01,880
The first task

466
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:03,000
is to report to the staff

467
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,480
to the superiors.

468
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:05,080
Also,

469
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:06,000
let me tell you.

470
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:06,480
it's not safe here.

471
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:07,320
We need to

472
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,320
find him a new hideout.

473
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,320
There's no one here.

474
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,040
Why is it not safe?

475
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,080
It's because no one is here.

476
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,040
That's why it's not safe.

477
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,760
Let's go, beautiful woman.

478
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,240
What are you waiting for?

479
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,160
Are you coming?

480
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,360
How is it?

481
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,840
I saw the Major himself.

482
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:43,560
But we have to

483
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:45,280
for him.

484
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,520
Why?

485
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,240
Isn't that place

486
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,280
Isn't it the best place to hide?

487
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,560
That's why

488
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:52,360
That's why

489
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,880
the key area of their search.

490
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,360
Our hideout

491
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,720
hit their gun.

492
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,600
No way.

493
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,160
Not many people know the cave in the grass mountain.

494
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:05,080
As far as I know, there was a mountain village down the mountain.

495
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,480
It's the best place to hide people.

496
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,120
Police Brigade.

497
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,560
We won't let this go.

498
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,920
They will soon find that area.

499
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:16,360
I was thoughtless.

500
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:17,520
Mr. Ye,

501
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:18,720
Don't blame yourself.

502
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,720
You are familiar with the village.

503
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,080
Think about it.

504
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,280
Is there a better place to hide?

505
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,560
Apart from Mount Hudang,

506
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,200
that is the mountain in the north.

507
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:33,160
But it's a long way.

508
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:35,920
Now the Japanese are investigating.

509
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,480
I'm afraid...

510
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,960
There's an old Chinese saying.

511
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,360
"Hidden in the City."

512
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,640
The livelier it is, the safer it is.

513
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,160
The less vigilant they are,

514
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,880
Think about it.

515
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,240
It looks lively

516
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,480
But the soldiers on the island

517
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:48,920
would never expect to search there.

518
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,920
What are you doing?

519
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,360
There is such a place.

520
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:09,880
Ju.

521
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:13,640
Ju!

522
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:16,800
Why are you here?

523
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,840
The snacks I made today

524
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:19,880
are all your favorite.

525
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,640
I'll get you some.

526
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,240
You're late.

527
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:30,040
I don't think it's just snacks.

528
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,720
What is it this time?

529
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,320
Do you know

530
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,120
what's going on in the library?

531
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,640
Why do you ask about the library?

532
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,480
My dad asked me to find something.

533
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,080
They are all Japanese now.

534
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,520
That's why I'm here to ask you.

535
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,600
What's going on?

536
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:51,960
Tell me.

537
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,760
Are you going to cause trouble again?

538
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:54,840
Oh.

539
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,520
Don't worry. The Japanese can't catch me.

540
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,360
I usually go there during the day.

541
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,840
They seem to rest at night.

542
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,120
What about the backyard?

543
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:09,960
The woodshed in the backyard.

544
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,280
The Japanese seem to be in the front yard.

545
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,480
There seems to be no one in the woodshed.

546
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,000
Who's outside?

547
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,160
Mr. Tang.

548
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:19,720
I'm leaving.

549
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,560
Eat it while it's hot.

550
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,480
Don't make trouble.

551
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:21,800
Don't worry.

552
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,880
Mr. Wang,

553
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,720
Please support us.

554
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,720
Sure.

555
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:25,520
Let's have a drink.

556
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,080
Good evening.

557
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,480
I've prepared a song for you.

558
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,360
Rose, Rose, I love you.

559
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:31,720
I hope you like it.

560
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:41,480
Rose. Rose is the most delicate.

561
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:45,840
Rose is the most beautiful.

562
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:50,040
The long summer blooms on the branches.

563
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:53,520
Rose, Rose, I love you.

564
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:53,960
Sir.

565
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:54,800
Enjoy.

566
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:00,920
Please enjoy.

567
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:03,520
Sir.

568
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:06,760
I want to know

569
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,640
about this girl here.

570
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,640
Well...

571
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,640
Go ahead.

572
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:15,480
Okay.

573
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:22,840
Look carefully.

574
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,320
Say it clearly.

575
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:25,600
Sir.

576
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,480
This girl doesn't belong here.

577
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,720
She's only been here once or twice.

578
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:34,760
One or two.

579
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,120
But everything shows that

580
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,800
this girl

581
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,320
a dancer here.

582
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,640
Coming.

583
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,160
Someone went to my room today.

584
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,000
They're all professional.

585
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,560
They didn't lose anything.

586
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,640
I guess the Japanese are checking the situation.

587
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,480
Have you reported to station 21?

588
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:04,640
I've been here for more than four years.

589
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,600
It can't be wrong.

590
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,640
One or two at most.

591
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,480
Who does she have more contact with?

592
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:15,920
Don't look that way.

593
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,280
I think you're being targeted.

594
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:22,320
It's leaking.

595
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,520
Are they investigating Miss Ye?

596
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,320
They are in danger.

597
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,200
We have to block them.

598
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:30,640
Okay.

599
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:33,840
Follow those two newcomers.

600
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,000
I'll take care of this.

601
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:38,960
Go.

602
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,360
That one.

603
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,320
What's going on?

604
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,160
Excuse me.

605
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,320
Two more.

606
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:09,199
Got it.

607
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,040
The two brothers

608
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,240
The two brothers in the dance hall

609
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,800
were killed by a container.

610
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,080
What did you say?

611
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:42,600
Who did this?

612
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:44,640
I don't know if it was an accident or an accident.

613
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:45,920
I've sent someone

614
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,160
the owner of the warehouse.

615
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:48,040
But

616
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,760
we haven't found out his background yet.

617
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,480
It was the delivery time.

618
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,200
So,

619
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,880
they might have come to the wrong place

620
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,240
at the wrong time.

621
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,120
What coincidence?

622
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:02,480
Guktae Ballroom is really strange.

623
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,480
We have many enemies in Shanghai.

624
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,800
We don't know who did it yet.

625
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:08,760
Of course,

626
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,880
we can't rule out the dance hall.

627
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,560
Send someone to watch.

628
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,840
at the dance hall.

629
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,840
Report to me if anything happens.

630
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,200
Send a telegram to Airlines 6.

631
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,960
to explain the situation.

632
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:37,840
Sir.

633
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,480
IShang Apartment sent someone to the dance hall of Guotai.

634
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,320
The people who investigated Ye Biying

635
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:54,600
didn't come back.

636
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:56,920
There are indeed some problems.

637
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,000
Right?

638
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,520
they found out something

639
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,640
They were killed.

640
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:06,600
We just sent a telegram.

641
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:07,560
Then something happened.

642
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,040
It seems that place is very sensitive.

643
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,920
The biggest possibility is what they found.

644
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,480
Send another telegram.

645
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,520
Please send someone

646
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,560
to continue the investigation.

647
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,920
This woman has a big problem.

648
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,800
Let's focus on Tan Jiawan.

649
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:26,320
From now on,

650
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,640
send more men.

651
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,760
I need to know her daily movements.

652
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,360
Irigami.

653
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:32,800
Yes.

654
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,920
Check the nurse named Tang as soon as possible.

655
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,120
I'm very willing to help.

656
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:41,480
Irigami.

657
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,000
Don't go too far.

658
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,480
Of course.

659
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,920
The gate of the library is right

660
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:56,920
a second-floor attic.

661
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,040
The attic is where they receive guests.

662
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,680
There were many ghosts in the yard during the day.

663
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:02,880
They queued up here.

664
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,320
The stairs are full of people.

665
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:06,480
So it can only be quiet at night.

666
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,040
Where is the secret room?

667
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,200
In the woodshed behind the academy.

668
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:11,320
Academy?

669
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,760
This used to be an academy.

670
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,480
My father invested

671
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,640
to build a school

672
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,280
for the children on the island.

673
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,280
The secret room inside is also big.

674
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:22,480
It's for kids to avoid robbers

675
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,240
to avoid the typhoon.

676
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,680
Who else knows

677
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,800
knows this place?

678
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,520
Not many.

679
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:29,000
Don't worry.

680
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,080
Oh.

681
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,760
I've seen this woodshed

682
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,000
It's full of

683
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,320
the tables and chairs used in school.

684
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,760
There are spider webs on the wall.

685
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,920
I don't think anyone has been there.

686
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,000
So I think the secret room is also safe.

687
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,000
Except the gate,

688
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,320
where else can we get in?

689
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:45,680
Here.

690
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:46,600
There's a hole.

691
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,520
We can enter the wood room through this hole.

692
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:49,960
But

693
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,000
we can see this house directly.

694
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,680
So we can't move during the day.

695
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,600
Dad is smart.

696
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,160
This is the best place.

697
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:01,920
Oshimahao can't find Americans.

698
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,120
I won't let this slide.

699
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,920
That's why

700
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,360
The key is

701
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,520
to the library.

702
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,000
I can't go during the day.

703
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,040
We can only act at night.

704
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,480
What should we do now?

705
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,480
This is the Navy Base.

706
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:18,560
We need to find a Navy uniform for the Major.

707
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,080
Where are we going?

708
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,120
The library.

709
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:57,880
This is the Navy base.

710
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,880
He can't go anywhere

711
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:00,720
he can't go anywhere.

712
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:38,560
Colonel.

713
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,120
The officer serves on Sunday.

714
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:43,960
It’s him.

715
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,040
who reported you for nothing?

716
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,680
How dare you report anyone?

717
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,240
Are you tired of living?

718
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:56,200
I'm sorry.

719
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:58,160
Please forgive me.

720
00:40:59,160 --> 00:40:59,840
What are you looking at?

721
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,480
Turn around.

722
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:05,320
Don't you want to vent your anger?

723
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:06,840
I'll leave it to you.

724
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:12,240
Tell me.

725
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,720
Why did you report me?

726
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,160
Sorry, Miss.

727
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:17,280
It's because...

728
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,760
I accidentally saw it.

729
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,240
A gun.

730
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,680
If you see a gun, report me.

731
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,880
Are you blind?

732
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:24,600
Tell me.

733
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:25,680
If you report me,

734
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,040
How much did the Police Brigade give you?

735
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,360
No.

736
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:30,720
Are you trying to harm me?

737
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:47,640
You want to frame me, right?

738
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,480
Who ordered you?

739
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:51,880
I won't tell you.

740
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,280
Do you know what this place is?

741
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,880
This is where kids study.

742
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,080
You made it like this.

743
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,880
You're disgusting.

744
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,200
Disgusting.

745
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:00,960
I'm sorry.

746
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:02,800
Get out of here!

747
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,120
I'll kill you!

748
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,280
I'll kill you!

749
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:11,200
If this happens again,

750
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,560
I'll shoot you to death.

751
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,560
Let go of me!

752
00:42:29,840 --> 00:42:31,080
Let go of me!

753
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:36,840
Commissioner Shen, Zhang Songwen.

754
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:38,120
Tang Ju, Lin Cheng.

755
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:39,400
Shinxiong Takahashi, Tadashi Wang.

756
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:39,720
Ishigami Kamakura Otsuka

757
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:40,040
Sasaki, Middle Spring Hero (Japan)

758
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:41,000
See you, Akino Kawaka. Chaiyao.

759
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:41,320
Fukuda Ping Chuan, Maichi Takishima (Japan)

760
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:42,040
Wang Yan Wu Zhang Wei.

761
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:42,280
Yi Dong Zhao.

762
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:42,600
Rat, Zhao Shuai.

763
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:42,920
Yumiko, Liu, Yi.

764
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:43,880
Mommy Wang Zheng.

765
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:44,200
