1
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,520
But the captain doesn't want to miss any possibility.

2
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,520
If Ye Biying wants to see him, let her.

3
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,360
As long as he's here.

4
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,320
It's fine now.

5
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,720
The sun.

6
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,120
I want to see the sun.

7
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,880
Ying'er.

8
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,920
The sun.

9
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,920
Little yellow duck.

10
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,520
Quack.

11
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:11,720
Ying'er, my sunshine.

12
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,400
Sunshine.

13
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,400
I remember you're a great swimmer, Lieutenant.

14
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,720
I am very good.

15
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,640
Can Ke Wen swim too?

16
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,360
He probably can.

17
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:32,400
The sun.

18
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,280
The sun.

19
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,040
The sun.

20
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,079
Catch the sun.

21
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:50,280
Won't he drown?

22
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,040
Pull him up!

23
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:52,680
Hurry!

24
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,090
Get him out of there!

25
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,400
Kewen, what are you doing?

26
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,360
Chasing the sun.

27
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,080
Why did you come?

28
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:09,680
Ju'er.

29
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,080
Ju'er,

30
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,320
I will definitely marry you.

31
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,240
Auntie Si made some snacks today,

32
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,240
all your favorites.

33
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,370
I'll bring you some.

34
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,000
Coming so late at night?

35
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,360
If you're a decent man,

36
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,280
then don't make

37
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,440
a girl worry about you.

38
00:05:47,159 --> 00:05:47,880
Fine.

39
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,840
I won't go see her anymore.

40
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,360
Happy now?

41
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,040
Okay,

42
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,100
please go home now.

43
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,650
I've liked you since we were children,

44
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,800
you know that.

45
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,360
I'm happy whenever I see you.

46
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,160
I can do anything for you,

47
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,680
even die for you.

48
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,720
- Are you coming?

49
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,280
- Are you coming?

50
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,400
Let me go!

51
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,000
What crime have I committed?

52
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,440
I don't regret

53
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,840
helping you with Ying'er.

54
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,120
I am Chinese,

55
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,240
a person from Sanzao Island.

56
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,440
I promise you,

57
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,360
I'll take you wherever I go.

58
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,000
Okay?

59
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,680
Before a person dies,

60
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,770
are there any signs?

61
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,160
If someone in another world

62
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,880
calls out to someone else,

63
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,840
will they hear it?

64
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,400
The Japanese Sixth Air Base

65
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,120
built on Sanzao Island in China

66
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,640
has begun evacuation.

67
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,680
The base houses fighters,

68
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,920
bombers,

69
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,520
and interceptors totaling 74 aircraft.

70
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,720
Most of them are being withdrawn to Japan,

71
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,160
preparing to join the war preparations against America.

72
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,440
The evacuation also alerted Takeki Ichiro.

73
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,880
At this critical moment,

74
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,440
he needs to quickly deliver

75
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,900
the vital information to the organization.

76
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,040
Get in.

77
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:56,760
If Commander Fujita

78
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,360
finds out I left the airport,

79
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,200
he'll definitely send people to look for me.

80
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,600
He won't find out for now.

81
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,160
Aren't you leaving soon?

82
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,860
Why did you call for me?

83
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,760
I need to send a top-secret telegram,

84
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:10,720
and the wavelength and call sign

85
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:12,080
cannot fall into anyone else's hands.

86
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:14,940
You're the only one at headquarters who can help me.

87
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,260
You mean you want me

88
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:17,920
to go to headquarters

89
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,450
and send a telegram for you?

90
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:19,960
No.

91
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,880
I absolutely cannot do this.

92
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,000
Most of the people at headquarters

93
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,200
have gone out on duty.

94
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,640
All we need to deal with

95
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,360
are just two radio operators in the communications room

96
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,820
and maybe a few orderlies.

97
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,280
You're going to kill people?

98
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,680
I'll ensure your safety.

99
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,560
You just need to confirm one thing for me:

100
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,680
that Commander Fujita

101
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,640
has allowed me to come send the telegram myself.

102
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,100
Colonel

103
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,040
Takegi.

104
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,800
I don't know who you really are,

105
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:41,920
and I don't want to know.

106
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,560
You surely have your own purposes,

107
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,440
but I need to tell you:

108
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:44,960
if

109
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,120
you want me to sacrifice myself

110
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,360
for strangers,

111
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,080
for people I don't even know,

112
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,360
I simply cannot do it.

113
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,280
Getting the plan to lift the maritime ban

114
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,480
helped the villagers

115
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,920
avoid a catastrophe.

116
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,250
You've already done it.

117
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,100
That time I helped you,

118
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:03,780
I was also doing it for myself.

119
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,680
The Sixth Air Base

120
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,010
exists in name only now.

121
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:48,360
With this troop withdrawal,

122
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,160
most of the garrison forces have left.

123
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,400
Our police unit

124
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,840
will likely be reduced soon as well.

125
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,080
The colonization group members

126
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,810
are training intensively now.

127
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,920
They'll soon form squads

128
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,360
and begin night patrols.

129
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,560
Why can't you all

130
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,680
come up with

131
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:28,160
a permanent solution?

132
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,400
Do we need to conduct

133
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,320
another liberation operation?

134
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:40,400
I'm afraid Commander Fujita won't approve.

135
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,360
Commander Fujita

136
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,640
has always dreamed of building

137
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,440
his utopia on Sanzao Island.

138
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:50,160
He forgot

139
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,760
how

140
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,560
Dalin Island was captured by the guerrillas.

141
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,570
Now the people on the island

142
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,600
clearly outnumber our garrison.

143
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,840
If this continues,

144
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,880
he'll need to prepare more tombstones.

145
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,440
You mean...

146
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,160
Tomorrow

147
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,160
I'll be leaving Sanzao Island.

148
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:29,760
Sasaki,

149
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,440
it's your turn now.

150
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,160
From now on,

151
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,840
this mess on the island

152
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,480
needs to be cleaned up by you.

153
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,080
Organize another

154
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,840
maritime restriction lift operation.

155
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:46,720
This time, go directly into their homes and take them.

156
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,920
Why?

157
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,440
If we're already going into their homes,

158
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,770
why take them to the sea?

159
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,120
Just use

160
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,280
the pretext of looking for Americans.

161
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,000
Hey,

162
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,440
go get Tang Bingchen.

163
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,200
Sir,

164
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:11,360
our men saw Major Wumu

165
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,200
driving away from the airport.

166
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,400
They're heading toward headquarters.

167
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,360
And

168
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,960
the interpreter is in the vehicle too.

169
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,280
Report complete.

170
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,640
That's very strange.

171
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,760
Commander Fujita

172
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,920
shouldn't he be at the airport?

173
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,440
I was planning to investigate further myself

174
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,560
before reporting to headquarters.

175
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:50,780
But now it seems...

176
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,360
It's all too late.

177
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,440
Sasaki,

178
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:00,840
come here.

179
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,640
Go to headquarters and send a message to Naval Command.

180
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:13,880
The Americans will bomb Tokyo in the next few days.

181
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,720
Honestly, I don't care

182
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,240
where the bombs fall.

183
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:29,400
I simply cannot tolerate

184
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:34,240
being outplayed by someone else.

185
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:36,160
Sasaki.

186
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,400
You must send the telegram

187
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,660
before Takemoku does.

188
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:29,680
This is crucial

189
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,010
intelligence about the empire's future.

190
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:32,880
Captain Oshima ordered

191
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,480
to send it to Naval Headquarters immediately.

192
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,450
If you delay this military intelligence,

193
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,680
Captain Oshima will have your heads.

194
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,160
It's no use telling us.

195
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,880
When Commander Fujita returns from the airport,

196
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:49,280
you can ask him directly.

197
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:50,240
By the way,

198
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,680
isn't Captain Oshima heading to Tokyo soon?

199
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,960
Why don't you go to Tokyo

200
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:55,400
to report directly? Wouldn't that be easier?

201
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,160
Get out of my way.

202
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,000
Move!

203
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:57,930
Get out of my way.

204
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,200
This...

205
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,200
He captured it from the front line.

206
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:12,960
He doesn't know how to use it

207
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,160
but can't bear to store it away.

208
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,080
I don't know how to use it either.

209
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:15,940
Will this work?

210
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,360
Not only are our bases withdrawing troops,

211
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,080
General Yamamoto has officially ordered

212
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:05,800
to extend the naval defense line

213
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,600
from the original 400 nautical miles

214
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,120
to 700 nautical miles.

215
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,880
Urgent!

216
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,640
Naval defense line extended to 700 nautical miles.

217
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:29,360
The main aircraft squadrons from three air bases

218
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,800
are being withdrawn to Japan.

219
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,280
Enemy has entered full defensive mode.

220
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,920
Northwest Bay post abandoned.

221
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,120
Find a way to get the guerrillas onto the island.

222
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,000
Greet mother.

223
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:24,060
Director Li's notification is easy to deliver.

224
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:26,920
But how should I contact

225
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,120
the American side?

226
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,120
Captain,

227
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,250
the entire street has been sealed off.

228
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:12,400
Go ahead.

229
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:13,330
Yes, sir.

230
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,920
Monitor quickly

231
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,040
and locate

232
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,680
the enemy's radio station position as soon as possible.

233
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,720
I want to see

234
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,580
how many of these rats are hiding in their holes.

235
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,200
General Yamamoto has officially ordered

236
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,280
to extend the maritime defense line

237
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,440
from 400 to 700 nautical miles.

238
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,280
Sir,

239
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,460
we've detected suspicious signals.

240
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,200
The Lumberjack requests to notify the Pearl River Column

241
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,330
to rescue the civilians on the island.

242
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:37,840
Sir,

243
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,640
the enemy radio station

244
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,040
is located right in here.

245
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:42,880
Military police!

246
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,440
Open up!

247
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,000
Open the door!

248
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Military police!

249
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,020
Open up!

250
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,200
If the Police Department tracks down this radio station,

251
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,800
I will continuously transmit

252
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,760
'Wild Goose' at the last moment.

253
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,600
Wild goose.

254
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,880
Wild goose.

255
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,400
My mission is complete.

256
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,560
The comrades miss you all.

257
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:36,720
April 17, 1942.

258
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,680
The lumberjack who had been silent for five years,

259
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,680
the sole contact person Chen Qiao,

260
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,960
died heroically.

261
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,160
Meanwhile,

262
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:46,680
the secret Communist Party radio station in Tokyo

263
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:50,040
was also forced to cease operations.

264
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,130
Report, sir.

265
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,280
Report, sir.

266
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,560
I waited for the commander and Deputy Officer Sakamoto

267
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,040
to return to headquarters.

268
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,360
I explained the situation to Deputy Sakamoto

269
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,760
before being allowed to send the telegram.

270
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,080
Why didn't you go directly to Commander Fujita?

271
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,880
I tried to see Commander Fujita first,

272
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,210
but he refused to see me.

273
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,520
Also,

274
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,640
I asked the staff at the communications room,

275
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,840
they didn't see Colonel Takeki.

276
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,420
Takeki didn't send any telegram.

277
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,120
Yes.

278
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,600
No telegram was sent.

279
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,320
How is that possible?

280
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,960
Go to the village and do what you're supposed to do.

281
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,560
I have a task for you.

282
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,640
Go quickly to the village entrance and gather the villagers.

283
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,770
We're going to start searching for the American pilots.

284
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:15,920
Go now!

285
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:23,640
Shout out!

286
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,840
Hurry, call out!

287
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,240
Fellow villagers!

288
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,800
Don't come out!

289
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,440
The Japanese are coming to kill!

290
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,560
Run away quickly!

291
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,760
Everyone!

292
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,640
Run!

293
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,360
Stay inside!

294
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,440
The Japanese are going to kill people!

295
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,040
Villagers!

296
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,040
Run away!

297
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:29,520
The Japanese are coming to kill!

298
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,800
Everyone!

299
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:36,560
Hurry, run!

300
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,240
Mr. Ye.

301
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,090
I'm here.

302
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,370
What is it, Wumu?

303
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,360
Mr. Ye,

304
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,440
I came to inform you.

305
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,600
Earlier today,

306
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,360
I sent a telegram to my superiors

307
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,440
about the military withdrawal from the island.

308
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:27,970
I believe

309
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,400
they are already developing

310
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,260
plans to evacuate the islanders.

311
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,680
I gave them your address.

312
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,440
Someone will contact you soon.

313
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:36,240
Please make some preparations.

314
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:37,960
Very good.

315
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,040
All right.

316
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:42,960
Well,

317
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:44,120
you may go now.

318
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,760
I'd like to speak with my father.

319
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,780
Could you wait for me outside?

320
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:58,720
Thank you.

321
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:00,600
Goodbye.

322
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:03,720
Wumu.

323
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,000
Thank you.

324
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:42,400
Take care.

325
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:43,320
Take care.

326
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:04,960
Let's sit down,

327
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:05,640
shall we?

328
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,360
I'll be gone for a few days.

329
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,400
I'll be back soon.

330
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,440
Take good care of yourself these days.

331
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:25,170
Understand?

332
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:26,560
I will.

333
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,520
Before you leave,

334
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,520
I want to test you on something.

335
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:34,920
Test me?

336
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,040
What do you want to test me on?

337
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,719
When you were little, your mother taught you

338
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:41,760
a Tang dynasty poem

339
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,840
called 'Poem in the Robe'.

340
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,239
Do you still remember it?

341
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:45,920
I do.

342
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:46,690
Come,

343
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,130
recite it for me.

344
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,600
A soldier on the battlefield,

345
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,880
how can he sleep in cold and suffering?

346
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,739
This battle robe made by my hands,

347
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:58,400
I wonder whose shoulders it will grace.

348
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,080
I deliberately added extra thread,

349
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,680
I purposely sewed with care,

350
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,980
stitching my feelings into every layer.

351
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,060
This life may already be passing,

352
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:14,160
but perhaps we'll find connection in the next.

353
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,520
Your memory is excellent.

354
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:20,320
Why are you asking me about this?

355
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,840
During the Kaiyuan period of the Tang Dynasty,

356
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,770
during Emperor Xuanzong's reign,

357
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:29,760
thousands of beautiful women lived in the imperial harem,

358
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,520
and

359
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,180
each one was talented.

360
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,520
These palace ladies,

361
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,760
those who received the Emperor's favor

362
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,920
were extremely rare.

363
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,000
Those who didn't receive

364
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,000
the Emperor's attention

365
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,330
were quite pitiful.

366
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,560
While living there,

367
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,760
they were required to do needlework.

368
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,440
They had to make clothes for soldiers

369
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,200
sewing military uniforms

370
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:54,200
and battle robes for the frontier troops.

371
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,930
There was one young palace lady

372
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:57,880
who was very clever

373
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,960
and talented.

374
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,440
She wrote this poem.

375
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:03,880
Then secretly,

376
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:05,960
she sewed it inside a battle robe.

377
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,840
The robe was sent to the frontlines.

378
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,890
It was indeed discovered by a soldier.

379
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,410
When the soldier saw it,

380
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,600
he was alarmed.

381
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,160
This was deceiving the Emperor!

382
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:18,800
He quickly

383
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,640
took the handkerchief

384
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,440
and presented it to the Emperor.

385
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,770
When the Emperor saw it,

386
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,560
he immediately sent people

387
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,160
to investigate in the harem.

388
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,400
The young palace lady thought,

389
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,260
I don't want to implicate others.

390
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,360
So she voluntarily stepped forward.

391
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:33,880
Saying,

392
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,040
It was me.

393
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:36,400
I wrote it.

394
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,440
Unexpectedly,

395
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,140
Emperor Xuanzong,

396
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,690
with great emotion,

397
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,130
only said one sentence.

398
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:47,920
Good.

399
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,360
Let me

400
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,960
be the one to fulfill your destiny in this life.

401
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,440
What a twist of fate.

402
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,820
The reason I'm telling you this story

403
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,360
is to let you know

404
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:10,160
that even women who seem unlikely to find happiness

405
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,360
never give up

406
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,620
their pursuit of happiness and freedom.

407
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:16,640
Ying'er,

408
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,280
Wu Mu is a good man.

409
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,840
Your current situation

410
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,300
is a thousand times better

411
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,680
than that palace maid's.

412
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,080
Go pursue your happiness.

413
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:32,920
Dad,

414
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,200
you've accepted Wu Mu?

415
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,440
I can take care of you

416
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,760
in daily matters.

417
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,040
But when it comes to love,

418
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,360
you must pursue it yourself.

419
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,040
I know.

420
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,560
In your world,

421
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,200
you need

422
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,240
confidence,

423
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:55,840
love,

424
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,450
and courage.

425
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,600
Wu Mu will give you all these things.

426
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:08,560
Go now.

427
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,200
Complete your mission first.

428
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,600
Don't overthink.

429
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:48,840
I'm proud of you

430
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,080
for everything you've done.

431
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,840
I'll be going then.

432
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,760
I'm getting old.

433
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,360
These farewell scenes

434
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:27,640
are hard for me.

435
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,800
I won't see you off.

436
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:37,450
Go ahead.

437
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,160
I'll be back in a few days.

438
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,000
Ying'er.

439
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:04,860
It's prettier than the previous one.

440
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,960
According to the information provided by the Lumberjack,

441
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,080
tomorrow at 3 PM,

442
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,080
after the troops withdraw from Sanzao Island,

443
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,280
all police forces

444
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,240
will be concentrated at Liantang Bay.

445

We'll enter through

446
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,520
the temporarily unguarded Northwest Bay

447
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,160
to get in.

448
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,880
This area has treacherous terrain.

449
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:04,640
Won't it be too dangerous?

450
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:05,320
No problem.

00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:08,000

454
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,580
