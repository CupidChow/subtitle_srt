1
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,320
His pelvis

2
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,240
by the villagers.

3
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,479
I can't talk.

4
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:41,080
[Are you sure?] Are you sure?

5
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,280
Are you sure

6
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,480
if he's the American.

7
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,160
What's the most important thing to be a cop?

8
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,820
Keep your ability to doubt everything forever.

9
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,160
You deserve it.

10
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,400
Master

11
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,600
Have you sent the letter to the island?

12
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,400
They were sent out before dawn.

13
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,280
Erhu brothers were killed by accident.

14
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,920
Besides being sad,

15
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,079
I'm also anxious.

16
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,240
I can't sleep all night

17
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,720
Master

18
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,720
Don't be too anxious.

19
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,880
Didn't Commissioner Shen

20
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,079
promised to help us.

21
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,320
Commissioner Shen and Fatt Wu

22
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,400
I feel relieved.

23
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,520
But I still have doubts.

24
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,960
Why are the officials

25
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,079
help us so much?

26
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,040
Aren't some of them trapped on the island too?

27
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,600
Ying Er

28
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,840
She's going back to that island now?

29
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,160
at this time?

30
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,200
She's just a girl.

31
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,400
How could she...

32
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,600
get the people

33
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,720
on the island.

34
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:11,560
It seems that

35
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,080
the government

36
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,360
are also desperate.

37
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:19,000
So we need to find a way.

38
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,959
If something happens to my niece,

39
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,680
my brother

40
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,000
will be in chaos.

41
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,880
Ye has only one daughter.

42
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,960
That's his beloved daughter.

43
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,480
Master.

44
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,400
Eat something first.

45
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,920
The heads of each hall

46
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:42,159
will be here soon.

47
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:43,320
waiting to see you.

48
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,760
So I need to

49
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,280
to meet these heads

50
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,760
to discuss this matter.

51
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,520
Go get it done.

52
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,760
Kewen.

53
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,480
Kewen.

54
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,640
What's wrong?

55
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,200
Kewen.

56
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,080
Kewen.

57
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,560
Bi-ying.

58
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,600
Ying Er.

59
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,800
What's wrong?

60
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,600
How did you get hurt?

61
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,480
Let me see.

62
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,520
Press it for me.

63
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,280
Press it for me.

64
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,200
It hurts.

65
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:40,600
Press it.

66
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,480
Kewen.

67
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,720
Don't move.

68
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:53,560
Be good.

69
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,280
Don't move.

70
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,480
It'll be done soon.

71
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,640
Don't move.

72
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,720
It'll be done soon.

73
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,080
Kewen.

74
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,330
It will hurt for a while.

75
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,520
It's okay.

76
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:24,640
Where else did you get hurt?

77
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,520
Where?

78
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,980
I'll take you home.

79
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,480
Go home.

80
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,320
Let's go.

81
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,320
Don't hit me.

82
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:46,880
Kewen.

83
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,200
Don't hit me.

84
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:49,840
Kewen.

85
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,960
Don't hit me.

86
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:53,920
Don't hit me.

87
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,600
You beat Kewen up like this.

88
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,760
Just kidding.

89
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,480
Just kidding.

90
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,760
What are you doing?

91
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,400
What are you doing?

92
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,720
Let him go!

93
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:10,360
Let go of him!

94
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,040
Come here.

95
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,960
Stand still.

96
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,800
Yes.

97
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,480
It's wrapped like this.

98
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,480
Very professional.

99
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,560
Miss Ye,

100
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,140
You're really professional.

101
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,480
What did you say?

102
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,610
I don't understand.

103
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,640
I don't know

104
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,200
besides singing and dancing,

105
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,960
I also trained bandaging.

106
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,640
Which mommy taught you that?

107
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:58,120
Do you need to think before replying?

108
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,120
It's okay.

109
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,960
There is

110
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,880
there.

111
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,800
Let's take our time.

112
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,320
What's wrong?

113
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,480
I'm not going.

114
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,880
I'm going to bandage him.

115
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,480
Let go of me!

116
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,360
Let go!

117
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,080
Kewen.

118
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:20,680
Kewen.

119
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,560
Kewen.

120
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,560
Kewen.

121
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,480
Miss Ye.

122
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,120
Can you bandage it for me?

123
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,160
They are bullying Kewen.

124
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,480
Captain Oshima.

125
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,000
It's okay.

126
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,320
It's okay.

127
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,120
It's okay.

128
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,320
It's okay.

129
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,640
It's okay.

130
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,600
Did you bandage Ye Biying?

131
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,200
Did you tie this knot?

132
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,080
What did I teach you?

133
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,760
Can it be so tight?

134
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,360
What if it affects the circulation of the head?

135
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,480
Are you trying to harm him?

136
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,480
or save him?

137
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,760
I'm sorry.

138
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,220
I'll study hard next time.

139
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,360
Colonel.

140
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,040
I made the knot.

141
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,760
They did.

142
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,480
Shut up!

143
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,000
Colonel,

144
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,240
I just invited Miss Ye to my place.

145
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,240
Why don't you go with me?

146
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,640
Sorry, Captain Oshima.

147
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,200
Commander wants to see me.

148
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,320
I need to go to him.

149
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,120
Next time.

150
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,320
I'll treat you to dinner

151
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,000
I'll treat you to dinner.

152
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,400
We still drink the wine we drank last night.

153
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,600
Colonel, your woman is really capable.

154
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,280
You surprised me.

155
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,480
I was a dancer before.

156
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,920
besides dancing with others,

157
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,880
but drinking with others.

158
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:04,800
and do nothing.

159
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,400
Now you're with me.

160
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,120
You can't do these things anymore, right?

161
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:08,880
As soldiers,

162
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,360
can see some blood.

163
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,480
Teach her more.

164
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,140
It'll be useful in the future.

165
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:15,200
You're so thoughtful.

166
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,760
One more thing.

167
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,360
I want to ask Captain Oshima.

168
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,280
Kewen is a friend

169
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,720
who grew up with my assistant.

170
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,920
is a fool.

171
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,680
Don't argue with him.

172
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,880
It's just a misunderstanding.

173
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,760
It's easy if it's a misunderstanding.

174
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,280
Just make it clear.

175
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,720
You promised me.

176
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:37,760
Of course.

177
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,400
Thank you.

178
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,400
Excuse me.

179
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,000
Sorry.

180
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,480
Kewen.

181
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:45,720
Kewen.

182
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:46,840
Kewen.

183
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,800
Hello. Hello.

184
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,720
Kewen.

185
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,930
Sorry, Captain Oshima.

186
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,640
Go back and rest.

187
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,880
I'm sorry.

188
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,320
Thank you.

189
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,360
It hurts so much.

190
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,090
Don't look back.

191
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,930
Don't look back.

192
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,280
I have something urgent to tell you.

193
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,400
Let's talk later.

194
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,720
We'll send more believers

195
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,040
fell off the plane

196
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,880
when he entered China.

197
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,840
Woodcutter, do your best to implement it.

198
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,840
The first plan

199
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,680
Send the trapped out safely.

200
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,360
Remember.

201
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,560
Good investigation.

202
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,400
What does it say?

203
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,400
Commissioner Shen has arrived in Macau.

204
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,880
He changed our mission

205
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,640
and asked us

206
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:24,600
to send Major Wilt

207
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,930
to Sambu Island safely.

208
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,760
What should we do?

209
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,120
He asked us

210
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,650
the first evacuation plan.

211
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,640
Review.

212
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,000
the scene of the crash in the corner.

213
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,260
Go to Mount Huangyang.

214
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,840
Is he in danger?

215
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,520
Commissioner Shen will

216
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,720
to ambush there in advance.

217
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,280
there will be a battle between them.

218
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,480
I'll go with you.

219
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:43,320
No.

220
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,240
I'm going.

221
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,880
Although

222
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,880
you're annoying,

223
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,800
But I'm a doctor.

224
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,840
Besides, I'm your assistant.

225
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,480
You can't go.

226
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,920
This is my order.

227
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,360
Don't worry.

228
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,680
The bullet that can kill me

229
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,810
is not produced yet.

230
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,240
Then you...

231
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,400
Be careful.

232
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,400
I'll be careful.

233
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:21,920
Start again.

234
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,720
to inspect the crime scene of Kiyomi.

235
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,720
We need Commander Fujita's permission.

236
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,000
I'll take you home first.

237
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,530
and go to the headquarters.

238
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,560
Let's go.

239
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,280
Before I go home,

240
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,610
Can I go to the hospital?

241
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,850
I'm worried about Major's injury.

242
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,960
You'd better forget who you are.

243
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,440
How is that possible?

244
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,640
The police team just lost

245
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:00,680
to look for.

246
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,240
If you go now,

247
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,160
you'll lead the way for them.

248
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,660
I'll listen to you.

249
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,360
Go back first.

250
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,960
We'll send more believers

251
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,840
The news of the crash

252
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,040
[was shocking.]

253
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,320
At this moment,

254
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,000
while trying his best to save Wilt Chen,

255
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,800
he needs to be clear

256
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:05,240
what military plan

257
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,880
between China and America?

258
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,280
Hurry up.

259
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,120
Are you ready?

260
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,480
Look what I've got.

261
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,880
She was looking at you all night.

262
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,120
Can I invite you to dance?

263
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,120
What are you waiting for?

264
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,480
Dawen Potter, what's wrong with you?

265
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,640
Coward!

266
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,320
Please give it back.

267
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:06,960
Please.

268
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,040
I'll give you something better.

269
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,770
Thank you, Bill.

270
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,200
Bill is a nice girl.

271
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,200
Tell her

272
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,160
where we are going?

273
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:26,800
No.

274
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,800
These army shouldn't be here.

275
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,000
The smell of their jacket

276
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,800
I'm getting seasick.

277
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,960
You get seasick no matter what.

278
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,560
Come here.

279
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,600
Just do as I say.

280
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,480
I have to go.

281
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,640
What would you like to drink, Colonel?

282
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,560
Whisky.

283
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,160
Two cups of whiskey.

284
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,339
Do you know I used to be a pilot?

285
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:08,800
Yes.

286
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,200
I was a pilot.

287
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,960
navigator.

288
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:14,480
Du Lite.

289
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:14,960
All these years,

290
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,000
I've heard a lot about you.

291
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,359
It's my honor

292
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,760
to work with you.

293
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,079
Me too!

294
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,000
Captain!

295
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,400
The Navy and the Army

296
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,680
between the Navy and the Army.

297
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:28,000
Aeronautics

298
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,860
received your warm hospitality.

299
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:31,800
Have you noticed

300
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,760
the chimney of the bee?

301
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,720
It says "Don't forget Pearl Port".

302
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,080
Since then,

303
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:36,920
these young people

304
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,840
always want revenge on Japan.

305
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:39,920
But

306
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,600
Even the craziest thought

307
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,120
I didn't expect

308
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,240
through a group of army pilots.

309
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,760
Please accept my thanks.

310
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,320
I haven't thanked you

311
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:50,040
for giving me

312
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:50,720
to me.

313
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,840
What a comfortable room.

314
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,040
It's an honor

315
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,400
If I knew

316
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,000
the Navy took such good care of them,

317
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,080
I'll join you from the beginning.

318
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,400
You're always right.

319
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,480
Lieutenant.

320
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,250
What's wrong with them?

321
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:11,840
Sir.

322
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,600
For the past month,

323
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:13,760
these young people

324
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,280
and are ready to carry out the mission.

325
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,480
To be honest,

326
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,400
after drawing lots,

327
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,480
they’ve been very depressed.

328
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:23,880
Mark.

329
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,040
Can we find a shop for them?

330
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,400
Lieutenant Colonel!

331
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,680
The navigator has over 2,000 ships

332
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,400
and 22 other pilots

333
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,080
to have enough accommodation.

334
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,410
That's not the problem.

335
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:37,600
I want to

336
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,920
as reserved pilots.

337
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,920
Thank you, sir.

338
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,520
This means a lot to them.

339
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,240
Jenny.

340
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,360
Guess who is on our boat?

341
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:51,000
James Du Lit.

342
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,720
Don't you know him?

343
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,080
Don’t you read the news?

344
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,360
He is the most famous pilot in America.

345
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,280
His men are all elites of the American Army.

346
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:00,880
It means

347
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,280
something big will happen.

348
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,360
Honey.

349
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,340
You double my life insurance.

350
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:06,880
Honey.

351
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,360
I really don't know

352
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,920
how long I'll be away.

353
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,880
We might go to the Philippines.

354
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,960
I really can't talk too much.

355
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:14,600
Yes.

356
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,400
I love you too.

357
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:16,040
Okay.

358
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,440
I have something for you.

359
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,080
I'll send it to you.

360
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,280
My baby.

361
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:21,760
Mom.

362
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,760
I miss you so much.

363
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,680
I miss you too.

364
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,640
How long are you going?

365
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,920
I want to see you.

366
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,600
Me too.

367
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,460
I don't know how long I'll be away.

368
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:34,520
Is everything okay there?

369
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,800
Can you do something for me?

370
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,240
What is it?

371
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,720
Are you sure Andy

372
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,960
my salary?

373
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,360
Yes, why?

374
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,880
What happened?

375
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,880
I just...

376
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,000
I don't know how long I'll be away.

377
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,840
That's all.

378
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,760
I can help you, but...

379
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:54,360
All right.

380
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,040
I have to go.

381
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:55,800
I love you

382
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,680
I love you, baby.

383
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,480
See you later.

384
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,480
Bye, Mom.

385
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,480
Bye.

386
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:30,320
Commander.

387
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,580
Lieutenant Sakamoto.

388
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,120
Do you want to get changed and come down?

389
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,960
Leave it to me.

390
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,800
Thank you.

391
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,730
You're good at swordsmanship.

392
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,680
Commander-sama.

393
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,610
As expected from a samurai family.

394
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,240
I feel ashamed.

395
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,080
Let's take a rest over there.

396
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,520
Yes.

397
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:50,080
I heard that

398
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,480
Yesterday you asked all the soldiers

399
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,920
last year, right?

400
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,260
Did you find anything?

401
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,800
Not yet.

402
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,720
Come to my command center.

403
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,380
You must have something to do.

404
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,520
Commander.

405
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,080
I'm here to report to you.

406
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,320
I want to bring another team

407
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,280
to Mount Hwangyang.

408
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,120
The scene of the Major General's fall.

409
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,840
Let's do another survey.

410
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,400
Like this.

411
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,120
Let's talk while eating.

412
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:44,320
Maybe my words are not pleasant to hear.

413
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,000
In China,

414
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,160
in China.

415
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,320
What Prime Minister General?

416
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,920
can be used for fun.

417
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,040
And you don't need to be responsible.

418
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,160
If you kill a high-ranking official,

419
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,560
A general is a hero.

420
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,320
This is not the first time.

421
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,740
I don't understand what you mean.

422
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:06,060
Let me give you an example.

423
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,480
There was a terrorist

424
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,200
a terrorist named Shuichi Nakaoka

425
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,960
killed the Prime Minister.

426
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,040
After the murderer was arrested,

427
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,480
He was sent to Tokyo Court

428
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,000
The court said

429
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,040
the murderer is only 19 years old.

430
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,970
He's still underage and immature.

431
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,000
When you grow up,

432
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:21,800
I might not kill people randomly.

433
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,330
It's important education.

434
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:24,800
will be pardoned.

435
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,800
Yes.

436
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,320
The strange things in China

437
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,480
in China.

438
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,810
I've heard about it too.

439
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,840
Do you know where

440
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,520
Where did he go?

441
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,960
Where did you go?

442
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:41,450
I was a guard at the Kandong Army Headquarters in Manchuria.

443
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:43,600
I understand what you mean.

444
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,120
You mean

445
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,760
behind every murderer,

446
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,480
is supported by the army.

447
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,600
I didn't say that.

448
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,400
Young man.

449
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,920
I mean you're talented.

450
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:58,200
You can't take things too seriously.

451
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,760
I brought the milk.

452
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,960
The milk just came out.

453
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,600
Try it.

454
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,240
Really?

455
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,080
So amazing

456
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,080
We can drink fresh milk here.

457
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,960
I asked the ships

458
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,880
from Guangzhou.

459
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,320
Our people

460
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,200
will feed them on the island.

461
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,730
That's how I got fresh milk.

462
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,640
Colonel will stay

463
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,480
in the command center.

464
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,760
Commander said

465
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,640
You can do it now.

466
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,400
But be careful.

467
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,640
Commander will stall Colonel Takemichi.

468
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,320
Be careful.

469
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,680
Commander.

470
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,380
Based on your experience,

471
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,320
should I

472
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,920
give up this investigation?

473
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,840
That's not what I meant.

474
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,280
Then what do you mean?

475
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:00,120
Do you remember 26th?

476
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,520
February 26th, Zhaohe 11th.

477
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,720
Lu Junhuang Road sent subordinate officers to lead

478
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,720
over 1,400 soldiers started a coup

479
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,040
and surrounded the Prime Minister's residence.

480
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,480
The National Assembly Hall.

481
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:12,400
Army! Army!

482
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,960
The Staff Headquarters and the police station.

483
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:15,760
Then,

484
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,820
He killed the eunuch, Saito Shizumi.

485
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,880
The minister, Takahashi.

486
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:21,320
Army Education Director.

487
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,280
General Kotaro Watanabe.

488
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,240
Prime Minister, Keisuke Okada.

489
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,800
He escaped from the bathtub.

490
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:30,800
Do you know

491
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,160
after the accident?

492
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,160
What's the attitude of the army?

493
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:37,000
After the accident,

494
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:39,400
after the accident.

495
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,920
I don't show my position.

496
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,320
The announcement from the army.

497
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,080
It's the first day.

498
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,560
The army participated in the coup was the dispatch unit.

499
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,360
The next morning

500
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,480
I became an army.

501
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,480
In the afternoon, it was occupied.

502
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,080
Until the fourth day,

503
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:51,800
I was reluctant to call it

504
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,000
the rebel army.

505
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,960
What's the Navy's attitude?

506
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:57,080
The Navy

507
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,720
from the beginning.

508
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,160
Why?

509
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,080
Why did the army

510
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,720
to the fourth day?

511
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:06,640
In the palace,

512
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,280
in the palace.

513
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,920
I heard His Majesty was popular.

514
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,200
He said

515
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,160
if the army can't suppress the rebellion,

516
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,520
I'll personally lead your army

517
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:17,600
to lead the army.

518
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,200
That's why I have to work hard.

519
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,320
It's just a statement.

520
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,240
Yes.

521
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,880
The conflicts between the Navy and the Army

522
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,800
is already known to the world.

523
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:33,360
So,

524
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,800
If you make any mistake,

525
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,200
the Navy and the Army

526
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,320
the Navy and the Army.

527
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,480
This plane

528
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,280
was maintained

529
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,040
the 6th Navy Airlines base,

530
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,680
But after flying back to Guangzhou,

531
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,400
after flying back to Guangzhou

532
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,840
in Guangzhou Army.

533
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,720
I'm just telling you.

534
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,520
The Navy and the Army

535
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:57,920
and the Army.

536
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,200
Is it that serious?

537
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,480
Let's go.

538
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:05,720
Okay.

539
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,080
Sir.

540
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,720
Do you want cigarettes?

541
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,280
The opium guy has packed them all.

542
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,560
Come with me.

543
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,360
Sir.

544
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,960
You can buy it here.

545
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,040
Today,

546
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,840
not only did I pack your cigarettes,

547
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,720
but also your people.

548
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,000
[Laughing]

549
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:04,960
Go to my room.

550
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,840
No, no.

551
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,600
I'm not selling it.

552
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,640
Let's go.

553
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,560
Come with me.

554
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,840
Rat.

555
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,760
How dare you fight me?

556
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,760
How dare you hit me!

557
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,480
I'll kill you!

558
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,680
What's going on?

559
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,880
Leave it.

560
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,160
Sir.

561
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,480
Does it hurt?

562
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,720
Look at you.

563
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:14,600
Why didn't you call me?

564
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:15,800
Why did I call you?

565
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,760
The best opium is waiting for you.

566
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,680
Smoke?

567
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,520
What do I smoke?

568
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,600
I have you.

569
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,600
I don't need opium.

570
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,560
Brother.

571
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,890
Geng is looking for you.

572
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,160
Now?

573
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:29,920
Now.

574
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,050
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

575
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,360
Mr. Chen.

576
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:34,720
Mr. Chen.

577
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,600
Macau

578
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,240
has become an isolated island in the Pacific.

579
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,920
Other than us,

580
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,640
the Japanese

581
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,080
almost all the other places

582
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,280
all the other places.

583
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,080
Now in our place,

584
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,120
adventurers

585
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,360
smugglers,

586
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,120
The people from the association

587
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,280
you must be successful.

588
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,920
You have to.

589
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,560
In comparison,

590
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,120
Anlan Clinic...

591
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,280
has lost a lot of colors.

592
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,640
Master.

593
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,760
With you and Mr. De on the island,

594
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:15,120
Anlan Clinic will be able to withstand the storm.

595
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:20,560
Master Geng.

596
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,360
The chiefs of each hall are here.

597
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,240
Thank you.

598
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,240
Enjoy.

599
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:50,920
Habha!

600
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,560
Sorry to keep you waiting.

601
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,200
No.

602
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,040
Sit down and talk.

603
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:07,480
Speaking of which,

604
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,639
Army and Navy don't get along.

605
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:15,239
This is history.

606
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,719
Two major sects

607
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:19,239
two major sects have appeared.

608
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:21,080
After the reform,

609
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,400
Samo became the Navy.

610
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:24,199
Changzhou became the army.

611
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:27,560
In the early stage of Mingji Reservation,

612
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,199
There are no meetings in China.

613
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:29,920
No constitution.

614
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,639
It's totally valve politics.

615
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,679
Samo and Jangzhou Princes

616
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:35,010
Each has their own army.

617
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:36,800
Army and Navy

618
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,480
of different factions.

619
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:39,480
Indeed.

620
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,159
Now,

621
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,520
we are incompatible.

622
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,520
Even if we make a screw nail,

623
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,840
If the army produces a left-spin,

624
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,560
the Navy

625
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,080
we must produce the right rotation.

626
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,610
That means it's different.

627
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:51,000
Yes.

628
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,060
You probably heard about it in China.

629
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,080
They're developing

630
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,480
the Navy's small ship.

631
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,360
And my Navy's military factory

632
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,690
is producing the tanks of the Army.

633
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,210
I've heard of it.

634
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:08,200
What's more absurd is...

635
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,280
a general of the Navy

636
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:13,520
wrote a book.

637
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,800
It's called the Book of Scolding Army.

638
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,200
Depart the base of each fleet.

639
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,480
Here!

640
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,080
I've detained him.

641
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,120
He didn't go down.

642
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:23,480
I've heard about it.

643
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,880
It's really ridiculous.

644
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,000
I didn't

645
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,040
stop you from going to Mount Hwangyang.

646
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,120
I'm worried,

647
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,560
Investigation is investigation.

648
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,120
Let's go and see

649
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,280
the terrain there.

650
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,240
This way.

651
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:36,920
Yes.

652
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,600
Geng.

653
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,720
Two brothers

654
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,320
two brothers died.

655
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,520
I couldn't sleep.

656
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,280
Tell everyone to discuss it.

657
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,680
The Erhu brothers

658
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:14,520
are loaches in the river.

659
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,780
I can't get off the sea.

660
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,840
It's not even ashore yet.

661
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,960
It's leaking.

662
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,240
It shouldn't be.

663
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,000
The Sect Leader is still here.

664
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,160
What are you talking about?

665
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:25,960
Don't forget

666
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,800
Erhu and the others are also your brothers.

667
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,280
Geng.

668
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,480
I didn't say anything.

669
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,130
In the past two days,

670
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,560
a government came here.

671
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:47,480
discussed with us

672
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,240
to deal with the Japanese

673
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,720
those Japanese.

674
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,720
I'm thinking of using this chance

675
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,080
to get my brother's family

676
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,480
on the island.

677
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,560
If they stay there,

678
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,280
I'm always worried.

679
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,400
I don't eat well.

680
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,400
This is a big deal.

681
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,480
Since 27 years of Republic of China,

682
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,960
the Japanese took over our island.

683
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,050
They're watching closely.

684
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,040
What about the seaside patrol boat?

685
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,280
It never stopped.

686
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:25,200
There are posts everywhere on the shore.

687
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,200
If we are not careful,

688
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,880
the old man and his family can't get out,

689
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:34,600
there might be some trouble.

690
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,960
Let's think about it.

691
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,600
Geng.

692
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,280
The man from the government

693
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,520
What can he do for us?

694
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,960
They are the commanders.

695
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,180
They are still powerful in the mainland.

696
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,000
Nakayama Yuan is leading the Seven Rangers.

697
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,660
They are their subordinates.

698
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:57,680
Geng.

699
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,560
I'll take my men

700
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,120
to kidnap the ambassador

701
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:01,880
in Macau.

702
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,040
Ask them

703
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,080
to Macau.

704
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:05,920
Isn't that enough?

705
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,120
Rat.

706
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,600
I know you're loyal.

707
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,760
If you do this,

708
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,080
if you do this.

709
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,260
I'll listen to you.

710
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,760
Take this matter

711
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:24,160
as a big deal.

712
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:27,080
Recently, ask the servants to look into it.

713
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,600
and find a good chance

714
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,120
We'll discuss it again.

715
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,080
to work with the government

716
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,800
to find a chance

717
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,560
to get it done.

718
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,560
Geng.

719
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,920
This is Sankuma Island.

720
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,040
You must go along the mud

721
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,480
along the mud.

722
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:48,880
There are

723
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,960
Jiang Zheng Quan’s guerrilla team

724
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,760
and the Communist guerrilla team.

725
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,960
We have to go no matter what.

726
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:58,640
Otherwise,

727
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:00,000
to the higher-ups.

728
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,840
If you insist on going,

729
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,240
bring more troops with you.

730
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,240
We need to ensure safety.

731
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:10,360
If anything happens to you,

732
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,520
I won't be able to explain to Tokyo.

733
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,720
Thank you, General.

734
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,040
If you don't want to mobilize the police force,

735
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:24,040
you can transfer two teams

736
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,760
from the garrison and the camp.

737
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,000
I'll inform the patrol boat team

738
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,840
to send you there.

739
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,480
When do you plan to move?

740
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,920
I'll bring the garrison.

741
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,520
If you agree,

742
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,080
I want to leave this afternoon.

743
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,920
and withdraw before dark.

744
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,120
It's too hasty.

745
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:44,560
How about this?

746
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,640
We'll act tomorrow morning.

747
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:47,880
Get ready today.

748
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,200
Send an officer

749
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,730
to take care of your safety.

750
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:51,840
and a radio station.

751
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:53,040
a newspaper.

752
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,360
Go to the base hospital

753
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:56,960
and send a doctor.

754
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,420
Prepare enough medicine.

755
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,120
If you are an officer,

756
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,720
let Captain Akino go.

757
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,800
The radio station

758
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,730
and informant are very important.

759
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,520
Before I go,

760
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:08,480
I must report

761
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,160
to Tokyo.

762
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,560
Sakamoto.

763
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:14,920
Yes.

764
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,360
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

765
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,000
Go to the telecom room with Colonel.

766
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,520
to transfer a radio station

767
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,000
to the colonel.

768
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,520
I'll ask Sakamoto to inform

769
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,040
the garrison team and the base hospital

770
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:29,640
Tell them to prepare

771
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:30,960
for you.

772
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,080
Good luck.

773
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,120
Yes.

774
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,240
Let's use the code this time.
