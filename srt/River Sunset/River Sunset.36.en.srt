1
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,640
Boss.

2
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,920
Haozi.

3
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,800
Living quite the carefree life.

4
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,280
You took my money.

5
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,680
What about what you promised me?

6
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,480
How is Sanzao Island

7
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,640
connected to Anlan Hall?

8
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,520
The island has allowed those fishermen to go to sea.

9
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,960
What's really happening at Anlan Hall?

10
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,120
Such simple questions,

11
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,600
and still no answers.

12
00:02:33,079 --> 00:02:34,240
It seems

13
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:38,160
I'll have to personally invite you.

14
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,160
What I, Haozi, have promised,

15
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,690
I will definitely deliver.

16
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,600
When will you confess?

17
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,400
At most 3 to 5 days,

18
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,600
at least a day or two.

19
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,640
At most 3 to 5 days,

20
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,770
at least a day or two.

21
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,120
I'll give you just one day.

22
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,000
By the way,

23
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,400
this time tomorrow,

24
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,280
if there's still no news,

25
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:15,320
you know what the consequences will be.

26
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:42,880
Xia'er.

27
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,400
Go home with Ju'er

28
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,400
and invite her father to our house.

29
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,680
Also, at the east end of the village,

30
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:50,079
invite Uncle Chongren and Uncle Bingyi

31
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:51,210
to come over as well.

32
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,040
Hurry up.

33
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:52,770
Yes, Father.

34
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,120
Colonel,

35
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,780
the commander and the guest are waiting for you in the living room.

36
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,640
Thank you so much,

37
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,640
Interpreter Luo.

38
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,680
My pleasure.

39
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,360
Not bad.

40
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,760
Reporting, sir.

41
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,640
The colonel has arrived.

42
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,160
Colonel.

43
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,050
I'm very pleased to see you.

44
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,360
It's also a great honor for me

45
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,680
to meet you, General.

46
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,240
An investigator from the Imperial Household Agency,

47
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,480
someone closest to the Emperor.

48
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,880
That's a position everyone envies.

49
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,810
Thank you for your kindness, General.

50
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,400
Do you know why I'm so interested

51
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,760
in your investigation?

52
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,360
Please sit.

53
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,200
Rumors are bloodless weapons.

54
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,280
They can create internal conflicts

55
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,320
and boost the enemy's morale.

56
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,120
Destroying our own morale.

57
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,220
After General Dajiao Censheng's incident,

58
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,080
various reports claimed

59
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,520
that the general's aircraft was shot down

60
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,760
by enemy rifles.

61
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,960
This is an absolute disgrace.

62
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,680
It's simply impossible.

63
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,320
Yes,

64
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,800
I noticed that too.

65
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,000
Colonel,

66
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,120
I want you to investigate this thoroughly

67
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:30,000
and restore the general's honor.

68
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,640
General,

69
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,520
I will definitely get to the bottom of this.

70
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,320
Commander.

71
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,360
When we arrived,

72
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,220
why didn't we see Captain Oshima?

73
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,060
They're busy with military affairs.

74
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,680
They went back to handle their own matters.

75
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,200
Please invite him to come

76
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,560
and have lunch with the General.

77
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,090
Adjutant Sakamoto.

78
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,240
Never mind them.

79
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,760
After lunch,

80
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,840
if you have time,

81
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,240
accompany General Sunagawa Kaneo with me.

82
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:04,880
Thank you.

83
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:05,890
My pleasure.

84
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,680
How's business?

85
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,640
Master Duo is here.

86
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:21,800
Sure, have an orange.

87
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,920
Great.

88
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,400
All right.

89
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,100
You can go back now.

90
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:44,760
Brother Hao.

91
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,480
Is Master Geng in?

92
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,640
Yes, I'll get him for you.

93
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,840
The master is inside.

94
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,360
Haozi.

95
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,480
What's wrong?

96
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,680
Why are you here?

97
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,120
Well,

98
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,120
I heard recently

99
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,120
that on Sanzao Island,

100
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,640
we can go fishing at sea now?

101
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,560
The brothers want to get a boat

102
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,280
to meet our folks at sea

103
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,080
and ask about our families.

104
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,840
I told them.

105
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,500
This matter

106
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,289
needs your approval first.

107
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,700
About this matter.

108
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,280
About this.

109
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,480
No news from home for four or five years.

110
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,080
The men are feeling anxious.

111
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,080
Tell your men.

112
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,480
Lifting the fishing ban

113
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,400
isn't going to happen overnight.

114
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,240
We need to see what those Japanese on the island

115
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,600
might do first.

116
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,560
Sir.

117
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,520
The pigeon has returned.

118
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,520
Mr. Ye, please continue with your work.

119
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:03,580
I'll head back now.

120
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:10,640
Sir.

121
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,920
Finally got a reply.

122
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:22,800
What

123
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,640
is this?

124
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:28,880
I don't know.

125
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,620
I've never seen it either.

126
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,120
Go and invite Director Shen from the National Government

127
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:32,850
to come over.

128
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,610
Alright.

129
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,400
How did you

130
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:41,720
Mr. Geng,

131
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,920
I left something there.

132
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,200
Haozi.

133
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,680
Mr. Geng.

134
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,480
Tell your brothers

135
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,640
to stay calm and patient.

136
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,320
Alright.

137
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,690
Send someone to follow him.

138
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,240
Go.

139
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:23,880
Yes.

140
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,560
Any news from Shanghai?

141
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,000
That guy from the Sixth Division

142
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,240
should be arriving soon, right?

143
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,560
He's already in Shanghai.

144
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,880
If he takes a plane first and then a ship,

145
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,120
he should be here in about two days.

146
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,120
Let's go.

147
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,040
Yes, sir.

148
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,240
Dad.

149
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,240
Father.

150
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,160
Papa.

151
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,480
Is there?

152
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,680
I guess he's already gone to gather the villagers.

153
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,400
Let's go out and find him.

154
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,730
We can't just stay here.

155
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,240
Your task today is

156
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,800
to make every effort to organize

157
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,860
the fishermen on the list to go to sea.

158
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,560
You must follow the list

159
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:44,160
and find every person on it.

160
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,040
Captain Daodao,

161
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,560
what if someone

162
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,160
isn't feeling well,

163
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,480
or their wife or child is sick,

164
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,920
and they can't go? What then?

165
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,650
I think it should be voluntary.

166
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,920
Find every person

167
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,480
and force them to go.

168
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,080
At least the people on the list,

169
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,490
not a single one can be missing.

170
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,520
Chairman,

171
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,690
This matter has already been decided.

172
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,920
They must go,

173
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,930
whether they want to or not.

174
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,720
Stop dawdling.

175
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,810
This is for the Great Japanese Empire.

176
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,420
Operation begins.

177
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,240
Yes.

178
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,480
Your Shangbiao Village.

179
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,640
Your Zhengbiao Village.

180
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,360
Your Tanjiawan Village.

181
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:57,960
Yes.

182
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:20,480
Go now.

183
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:20,960
Quick.

184
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:21,600
Hurry up.

185
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,040
Hurry up and go.

186
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:25,720
Hurry.

187
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,040
Let's go.

188
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,360
Hurry up.

189
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,560
Move faster.

190
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,480
Let's go.

191
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,480
This isn't working.

192
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,880
Let's get Chongren and Uncle Bingyi first.

193
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,720
Come out now.

194
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,480
Hurry up.

195
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,320
This way, hurry.

196
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,120
Stop dawdling.

197
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,400
Move it.

198
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,400
Go this way, quickly.

199
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,080
Hold on tight.

200
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,080
Move faster.

201
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,200
Go.

202
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:08,800
Get out here.

203
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,080
Assemble now.

204
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,320
Chongren, Uncle Bingyi.

205
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,920
My dad needs to see you urgently.

206
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,320
You have to come with me to my house.

207
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,640
Okay.

208
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,560
Let's go then.

209
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,840
Alright.

210
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,400
It's my dad.

211
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,200
I'll go find him first.

212
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:24,760
See you at home in a bit.

213
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,920
Okay. Those who haven't got their sea permits yet,

214
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,120
go get them quickly.

215
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,520
And prepare to set sail.

216
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,840
Attention everyone!

217
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,240
Those who haven't received their sea permits,

218
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,640
hurry up and get them now.

219
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,880
Prepare to set sail.

220
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,400
Attention everyone!

221
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,840
Those who haven't received their sea permits,

222
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:41,120
hurry up and get them now.

223
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,400
Prepare to set sail.

224
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,280
Attention everyone!

225
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,480
Those who haven't received their sea permits.

226
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,640
Father.

227
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,520
I need to tell you something.

228
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,130
Can't it wait until we get home?

229
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,760
The Japanese

230
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,200
are planning to force everyone out to sea

231
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,200
and kill them all.

232
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,280
Really.

233
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,760
Quick, quick, quick.

234
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:06,800
Something came up at home.

235
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,720
We'll be right back.

236
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:08,520
Be right back.

237
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,720
Quick, quick, quick.

238
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,000
Everyone, listen up.

239
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,280
Those who haven't gotten their sea permits yet,

240
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,680
go get your sea permits quickly

241
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:16,010
and prepare to set sail.

242
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,120
Dad, don't worry.

243
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,520
They should be here soon.

244
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,000
Any later will be too late.

245
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,120
Where's Ju'er's father?

246
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:41,920
Ju'er went to get him.

247
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,050
She'll be back soon.

248
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,920
Forget it.

249
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,320
We can't wait any longer.

250
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,000
Degong,

251
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,640
what happened?

252
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,900
Why are you so anxious?

253
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,320
The Japanese are organizing a sea trip today.

254
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,680
It's a trap!

255
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,040
They plan to take all those islanders who go out to sea

256
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,400
and kill them all at sea.

257
00:15:59,240 --> 00:15:59,960
Kill them.

258
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,920
We need to think of something quickly.

259
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,320
We can't let everyone go.

260
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,240
They've started.

261
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,560
My son is on the list too.

262
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,120
What should we do?

263
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,080
Let's go tell everyone.

264
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:10,520
Go.

265
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,400
Hurry up.

266
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,080
Dad, I want to go too.

267
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:13,920
Let's go, Mrs. Si.

268
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,560
Let's go.

269
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:20,800
Degong.

270
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:22,880
Degong.

271
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,640
Bingchen.

272
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,720
Is what Ju'er said true?

273
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,640
It's absolutely true.

274
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,720
We need to split up now.

275
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:31,200
If we wait any longer, it'll be too late.

276
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,120
Hurry!

277
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:32,760
Degong!

278
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,320
Wait!

279
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:34,560
What?

280
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,680
These two children

281
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,800
can't go.

282
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,160
The Japanese are now rounding up everyone

283
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:40,480
who's supposed to go to sea.

284
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,200
This Xia'er

285
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,760
is on their list.

286
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:43,960
He needs to hide now.

287
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:44,970
I won't hide.

288
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:47,980
Bingchen is right.

289
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,080
If you go now,

290
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:49,480
it's like

291
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,410
walking straight into their trap.

292
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,100
I still won't hide.

293
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,720
I have an idea.

294
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,200
Here's what we'll do.

295
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:57,800
Ju'er,

296
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,800
go with him.

297
00:16:59,120 --> 00:16:59,960
Hurry!

298
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,220
Hide in the mountains.

299
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,280
Don't come back to the village.

300
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:02,920
Do you understand?

301
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:03,840
Don't come back no matter what.

302
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:04,599
Go now!

303
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:05,640
I won't leave.

304
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,480
Leave first.

305
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,640
Then we'll figure something out.

306
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,760
Hurry up and go.

307
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,540
What are you doing?

308
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,319
I can't leave you here alone, Father.

309
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:16,250
And hide myself.

310
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,800
You say you can't abandon me.

311
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,079
And hide by yourself.

312
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,240
You think that would be unfilial.

313
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:24,920
Right?

314
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:26,839
Fine.

315
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,240
The loyalty and filial piety I taught you,

316
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,080
you've kept them in your heart.

317
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,210
That makes me proud.

318
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,280
But have you considered,

319
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:35,760
if you insist on being stubborn now,

320
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,640
and then get captured by the Japanese,

321
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,720
taken out to sea,

322
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,200
and die there?

323
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,080
How would I feel?

324
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:45,480
A father burying his son.

325
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,410
Is that what you call filial piety?

326
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,160
And what about Ju'er?

327
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,520
You two just got married.

328
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:52,960
If something happens to you,

329
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,960
if you meet with misfortune,

330
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,290
what will happen to her?

331
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,210
Do you want her to be a widow?

332
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,520
Father,

333
00:17:58,520 --> 00:17:59,200
if we hide,

334
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,240
the Japanese will still come after you.

335
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,600
Don't worry about that.

336
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,040
They only want to kill

337
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,280
the young men on the island.

338
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,520
Old men like us

339
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,080
aren't a threat to them.

340
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,480
They won't harm us.

341
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,400
You two children must listen to us.

342
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:13,520
Ju'er,

343
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,920
hurry and go with Xia'er.

344
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,240
Xia'er,

345
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:17,920
Uncle is

346
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,480
Father!

347
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,490
entrusting my daughter to you.

348
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,200
Go quickly.

349
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,640
Go now.

350
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,610
Why are you still kneeling?

351
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,520
All right.

352
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,480
Let's go now.

353
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:49,840
De Gong,

354
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,640
don't worry.

355
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,880
I know what to do.

356
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,960
Everyone, attention!

357
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,720
Everyone come out and gather!

358
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:14,080
Over there.

359
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:18,560
Everyone on the sea voyage list,

360
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,800
come out and gather!

361
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,860
Everyone come out and gather!

362
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,920
Let's go.

363
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,480
Hurry up!

364
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,520
Everyone gather at the village!

365
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,720
Coming!

366
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,360
Hurry up!

367
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,040
Quick!

368
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:58,720
You guys,

369
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,480
go find our council members right away.

370
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,080
Find those in Tanjiawan,

371
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:04,880
Shangbiao Village,

372
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:05,480
Zhengbiao Village.

373
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,280
Find them all.

374
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,920
Have them split up.

375
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,480
Tell the villagers

376
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,840
not to go out to sea anymore.

377
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:11,400
Chairman Tang,

378
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,720
did you get it wrong?

379
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,120
Weren't we supposed to go out to sea?

380
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,720
Why are we not allowed to now?

381
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,480
On the surface, we're telling them to go out to sea.

382
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,680
But secretly,

383
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,960
we're telling them not to.

384
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:23,960
Why?

385
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
If they go out, they won't come back.

386
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,600
Quick!

387
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,760
Go now!

388
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,280
Let's go.

389
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:39,800
Come on.

390
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,120
Let's go.

391
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,200
What's going on?

392
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:58,000
This is

393
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,660
a plan to lift the maritime ban on Sanzao Island.

394
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,200
The Japanese have a plan.

395
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,400
Everyone who goes to sea

396
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,000
will die at sea.

397
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,700
Then we need to find a way to save them!

398
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,200
I'm worried that

399
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,400
as soon as we go out to sea for rescue,

400
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,920
the garrison will block the waters

401
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,380
and capture us all at once.

402
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,600
What should we do then?

403
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,840
The Japanese on the island

404
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:27,800
have already carried out three massacres.

405
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,640
This time, no matter what,

406
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,120
we can't let them kill this group of people again.

407
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:31,600
Director Shen.

408
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,330
Don't worry.

409
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:36,620
The lumberjack's secret letter already has detailed arrangements.

410
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,920
Go back quickly,

411
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,600
or hide somewhere else.

412
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,330
Just don't stay at home.

413
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,720
Really? Then let's go.

414
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:43,640
Hurry up,

415
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,240
go back and pack your things.

416
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,480
Coming!

417
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,480
Everyone, pay attention!

418
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,600
We're going out to sea to fish.

419
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,130
Get the fishing nets ready.

420
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,760
Are you ready?

421
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Hurry up!

422
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:29,880
Okay.

423
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:30,520
Almost done.

424
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,160
Mr. Li,

425
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,480
take these two

426
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:33,680
to that house.

427
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,600
Leave this to me.

428
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:34,960
Go now.

429
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:35,760
Make it quick.

430
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,680
Come on, hurry up.

431
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,160
Be careful.

432
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,000
Find a place to hide quickly.

433
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:51,760
Leave the village.

434
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,640
Don't go to sea.

435
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,840
If you go out there, you won't come back.

436
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,450
Who are you looking for?

437
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,640
Tell your master

438
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,680
the boss from Anlan Hall is here.

439
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,240
Please wait a moment.

440
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,520
Oh, it's you.

441
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,040
Mr. Rong is waiting for you.

442
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:37,920
Come in.

443
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,660
[Open the door]

444
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,040
Sixth Air Base Special Police Unit.

445
00:23:59,040 --> 00:24:01,120
Investigation confirms carrier pigeons are used for communication between the island and Macau.

446
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:05,520
The pigeons are hidden in Ye Degong's house.

447
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,480
Rong Organization of Macau.

448
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,400
Come back early.

449
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,400
Take it easy.

450
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,480
Come back soon.

451
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,480
One, two, three.

452
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,280
One, two, three.

453
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:52,050
Those are from Zhengbiao Village.

454
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:55,250
These are from Shangbiao Village.

455
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,050
Where are the people from Tanjiawan Village?

456
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:01,880
Soon.

457
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,680
Tanjiawan is the largest village.

458
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,140
And the most complicated.

459
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,920
They should arrive within two hours.

460
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:14,600
Report!

461
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:17,160
We can't gather the people from Tanjiawan Village.

462
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:18,160
Our captain requests that the commander

463
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,360
send reinforcements.

464
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,220
What happened?

465
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,720
Our captain says

466
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,560
we need to search each house one by one.

467
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:30,920
Captain.

468
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,580
A telegram from the Rong Organization in Macau.

469
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:38,420
Sasaki.

470
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,120
Yes.

471
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,040
Rong Zezuo from Macau

472
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,840
has been a great help to us again.

473
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,280
There's still time.

474
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:45,040
Sasaki,

475
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,040
take more men with you.

476
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:47,760
They need reinforcements there.

477
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,240
Also,

478
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,600
escort Ye Longxia to sea yourself.

479
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:52,880
Understood.

480
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,840
Third squad, assemble!

481
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,560
Ladies and gentlemen of the press.

482
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:07,200
Stop the slaughter! Blood for blood!

483
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,000
Ladies and gentlemen,

484
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,660
please calm down for a moment.

485
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,000
I am Ye Zhaogeng,

486
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,480
Master of the Anlan Hall in Macau.

487
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,720
This Anlan Hall has another name.

488
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,180
It's called the Sanzao Island Association.

489
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,840
During the Qing Dynasty,

490
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,280
it was founded in Hawaii.

491
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,880
Now in the United States,

492
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:26,600
France,

493
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,480
Italy,

494
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,360
Australia, Hong Kong and Macau,

495
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,880
there are 13 branches worldwide.

496
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,360
Now I

497
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,880
on behalf of all 13

498
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,140
Sanzao Island Associations worldwide,

499
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,200
and representing my hometown,

500
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,040
the people of Sanzao Island,

501
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,120
I'm here to announce to you all

502
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,120
information we've just received,

503
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:50,640
a despicable

504
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,560
and shocking piece of news.

505
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,120
What news?

506
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,000
What is it?

507
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,320
What exactly is this news?

508
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,450
What does this mean?

509
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,760
What you've just received,

510
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,480
which we've only just obtained,

511
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,880
is a list of 261 fishermen

512
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,480
that the Japanese military

513
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,560
is planning to massacre,

514
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,220
along with their action plan.

515
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,520
This means

516
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,760
right now

517
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,360
Japanese soldiers in my hometown

518
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,760
are gathering these fishermen onto boats.

519
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,880
Then,

520
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,480
using deceptive methods

521
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:35,800
to lure them out to sea,

522
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,360
and with the most despicable means

523
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,280
massacre them all at sea.

524
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,360
The specific massacre plan

525
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,480
is written in the document

526
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,960
in great detail.

527
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:47,920
Mr. Ye,

528
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,120
we'd like to know how

529
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,280
you obtained this plan.

530
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,720
Is this information reliable?

531
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,480
Mr. Ye,

532
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,960
does the Japanese Southern Army Command

533
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,160
support this action as well?

534
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,800
Can we go to where

535
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,760
the Japanese are preparing this massacre?

536
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,600
Almost all disciples of our Anlan Hall

537
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,760
come from Sanzao Island in Zhongshan.

538
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,000
The Japanese have conducted

539
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,400
three major massacres

540
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,600
in our hometown in recent years.

541
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,800
They killed over 10,000 villagers,

542
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,280
and now they're planning another massacre.

543
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,240
I appeal to

544
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,680
media reporters from around the world

545
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,640
to help us stop this atrocity.

546
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,770
Stop this atrocity.

547
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,200
Anlan Hall has rented

548
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,460
several Portuguese merchant ships at Macau's New Harbor.

549
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,480
If the Japanese

550
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,720
dare to lure my fellow villagers

551
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,080
out to sea,

552
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,280
I, Ye Zhaogeng,

553
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,080
ask all media friends

554
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,600
to come with me

555
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,280
to witness the most shameless

556
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,160
and ugliest atrocity in history.

557
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,800
Alright.

558
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,920
Don't go out to sea.

559
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:28,380
If you go out to sea,

560
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,000
you won't come back.

561
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,880
What's wrong?

562
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,200
The Japanese are going to kill people.

563
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,040
Really?

564
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:34,600
No way.

565
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,040
Why would I lie to you?

566
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:38,120
Hurry up and find a way to escape.

567
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,080
Quickly!

568
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,040
Let's go.

569
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:41,040
Hurry!

570
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:32,760
Mr. Hao.

571
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:35,880
Mr. Hao.

572
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,290
What are you looking at?

573
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,000
What's wrong?

574
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,400
You look so unhappy.

575
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,720
Telegram!

576
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,040
Telegram!

577
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:50,880
Make way!

are carrying out a massacre.

584

Hurry up.

595
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,410
I can walk by myself.

596
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,560
Hurry!

597
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:28,960
Hurry!

598
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,720
Move quickly!

599
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,880
Isn't this Chairman Tang?

600
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,760
Goodbye.

601
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,160
Why are you being escorted by the Japanese?

602
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,040
What's going on?

603
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,370
What is happening here?

604
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:52,800
Chairman.

605
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,760
Captain Oshima.

606
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,810
Why are there so few fishermen?

607
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,720
I...

608
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,960
I notified everyone.

609
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,800
They just won't come.

610
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:10,080
There's nothing I can do.

611
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,850
Why won't they come?

612
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:13,840
I don't know.

613
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,480
What are you good for?

614
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:20,170
I really don't know!

615
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,530
As the chairman of the Maintenance Association,

616
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,540
you dare to say you don't know?

617
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,200
Then,

618
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,680
what's the point of keeping you around?

619
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:34,040
I really don't know,

620
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,280
Captain Oshima.

621
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:35,640
I'm begging you.

622
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,640
How about this...

623
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,610
Since there aren't enough people,

624
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,800
you'll go make up the numbers yourself.

625
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:45,240
Move!

626
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,480
I won't go!

627
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,280
I won't go!

628
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:48,920
Get over here!

629
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:49,920
I won't go!

630
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,400
Why should Chairman Tang have to go?

631
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,660
Look at Chairman Tang!

632
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,480
Search everything!

633
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,280
Yes, sir.

634
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,730
Where is Ye Longxia?

635
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,680
I don't know.

636
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,240
Where is he?

637
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:03,760
Captain.

638
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:07,020
Captain, we found something over there.

639
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:21,639
Captain.

640
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:22,440
It's this one.

641
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:31,679
Should we take all these pigeons

642
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,040
back with us?

643
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,159
I don't think that's necessary.

644
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,600
Let's find Ye Longxia first.

645
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:48,679
Sir.

646
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:50,040
Please calm down, sir.

647
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,679
Who let you in?

648
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:53,239
Sir.

649
00:34:53,239 --> 00:34:54,199
Who let you in?

650
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:55,199
Please calm down.

651
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,880
Calm down.

652
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:59,960
What are you doing?

653
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,000
Get out! All of you, get out!

654
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:06,540
Tell them to leave.

655
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,560
Mr. Ye.

656
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,040
What are you doing?

657
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,080
Where is Ye Longxia?

658
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,320
I don't know.

659
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,000
You don't know?

660
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,400
Then you'll have to come with us.

661
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:30,960
Take him.

662
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,640
Don't touch my father!

663
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,120
Stop!

664
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:33,840
This is the Ye residence!

665
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:34,480
You can't arrest our master!

666
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,360
This isn't your police station!

667
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,160
Let me go!

668
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:36,840
Stop!

669
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,240
I'm sorry,

670
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,120
Miss Ye.

671
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,640
Either Ye Degong or Ye Longxia must come with us.

672
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,480
Take him.

673
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,600
Let go!

674
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:46,920
Let go!

675
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,560
Let go!

676
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:52,840
I'll walk myself.

677
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,160
Father!

678
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,720
Fall back.

679
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,360
These tidal flat fortifications

680
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:42,960
were designed according to

681
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,960
permanent defense plans.

682
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,480
The machine gun firepower of this main bunker complex

683
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,400
can withstand the strongest enemy forces

684
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,240
during 48 hours of continuous assault

685
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,720
without any issues.

686
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,560
Indeed.

687
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,800
The troops withdrew

688
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,320
and abandoned these

689
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,200
meticulously constructed permanent fortifications.

690
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,080
It's a bit of a shame.

691
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,520
Let's go then.

692
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:20,800
Stop the slaughter, blood debts must be paid!

693
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,800
Come and see!

694
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:22,920
Blood debts must be paid!

695
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:23,680
Look!

696
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:24,480
Reject the slaughter!

697
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,280
What are they doing?

698
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,000
I don't know.

699
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,760
Blood debts must be paid!

700
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,000
What are they shouting about?

701
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:38,880
Stop the slaughter, blood debts must be paid!

702
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:17,480
Stop the massacre! Blood debts must be paid!

703
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:28,480
Stop the killing! Blood debts must be paid!

704
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,320
What are these people shouting about?

705
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,680
It seems to be about the Sixth Air Base.

706
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,740
A confidential document was leaked.

707
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,360
It caused this riot.

708
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:40,280
Quickly send a telegram to the Foreign Ministry.

709
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:40,960
Yes, sir.

710
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:52,600
Stop the killing! Blood debts must be paid!

711
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,160
Mr. Ye is here.

712
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:04,200
Mr. Ye.

713
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:09,720
Mr. Ye.

714
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,960
Mr. Ye.

715
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,160
Mr. Ye.

716
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,360
Fine, Mr. Ye.

717
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:24,280
Ye Longxia isn't here.

718
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:26,140
They brought his father instead.

719
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,160
Mr. Ye.

720
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,040
Mr. Ye.

721
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:08,080
Where is Ye Longxia?

722
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,000
I'm asking you one last time.

723
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,040
Fine.

724
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:28,720
Let's see

725
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,600
what's harder, your neck

726
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,280
or

727
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,640
my gun.

728
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,530
Take him to the boat.

729
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,320
Who dares touch my father?

730
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:38,680
It's all right.

731
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:39,340
Don't move!

732
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:42,920
I can walk by myself.

733
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:34,840
Degong.

734
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,360
Why are you here?

735
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,040
Dad.

736
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:24,000
We can't go out to sea.

737
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,360
What should we do?
