1
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:35,479
Deputy Captain Inoue Kamakura

2
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:40,320
fought bravely

3
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:47,000
died in battle.

4
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,210
Alright, I understand.

5
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:53,640
Through countless lives in the three realms,

6
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:04,960
Year after year passes without a breeze.

7
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:21,800
By the Bridge of Helplessness, watching the cycle of rebirth,

8
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:34,720
Guiding souls and listening to ghostly voices.

9
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,680
Retribution.

10
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,720
Old man,

11
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,880
I'm sending you back today.

12
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,720
Inoue Mansion.

13
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,000
Mr. Inoue Akira.

14
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,480
Yesterday, in an enemy

15
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,720
attack on the Sixth Air Base,

16
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,400
Deputy Commander Inoue Kamakura

17
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,320
fought bravely

18
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,560
and died heroically.

19
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,450
Cherry blossom season is coming soon.

20
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,160
I've had them learn this dance especially.

21
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,800
Please watch, General.

22
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,200
It's like being back home

23
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,930
during cherry blossom season.

24
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:41,480
How thoughtful of you, Inoue.

25
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,800
Thank you for your hard work.

26
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,159
Have another drink.

27
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,840
Master.

28
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,720
Impossible.

29
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,240
I am too old now.

30
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,580
I can't kill my enemies with my own hands.

31
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,410
I've missed the chance to avenge all of you brothers,

32
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,040
and over ten thousand deceased villagers

33
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,960
from Sanzao Island.

34
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:16,620
I've lost the perfect opportunity for revenge.

35
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,280
I have failed my ancestors

36
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,080
and the spirits of all my brothers.

37
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,720
I am so useless!

38
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,760
Master.

39
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,840
Master.

40
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,760
Sir,

41
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:52,490
there are some merchants from Sanzao Island requesting to see you.

42
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,960
Bring them in.

43
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,600
We need to

44
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:13,120
get an explanation from Master Geng about this matter.

45
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,120
Let's verify it.

46
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,320
Master Geng.

47
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,920
We've heard that

48
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,720
someone in Macao has spread news

49
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,800
that the Japanese troops on Sanzao Island

50
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,040
will lift the maritime ban in a couple of days

51
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,120
and allow islanders to go fishing at sea.

52
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,400
Is this true?

53
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,480
That can't be right.

54
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,600
Since these Japanese devils occupied the island,

55
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,840
they've banned maritime activities

56
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,440
for more than four years now.

57
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:42,480
Where did you

58
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,809
hear this information?

59
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,320
Master Geng,

60
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,080
it was overheard by someone

61
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,160
who works at the Japanese consulate.

62
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,290
This information should be reliable.

63
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,480
Let me think

64
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,240
about this matter a bit more.

65
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,160
Once I figure it out,

66
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,120
I'll let you all know.

67
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:07,410
I'll send someone to gather information.

68
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,960
I'll notify everyone when I have news.

69
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,640
At that time,

70
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,200
we'll discuss it thoroughly.

71
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:14,920
Alright, Mr. Ye,

72
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:15,880
we'll take our leave now.

73
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,760
Goodbye.

74
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,090
Lao Yi, see them out.

75
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,400
Lao Yi.

76
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,360
Arrange for someone to find out

77
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,320
if Director Shen from the National Government

78
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,520
has returned yet.

79
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,320
I have important matters

80
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,450
to discuss with him.

81
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,160
Make way.

82
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:28,920
Excuse me.

83
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:29,840
Let me through.

84
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,160
Step aside.

85
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,600
Director.

86
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,760
Director

87
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,120
please take a break.

88
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,560
Zheng,

89
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,800
what's been happening

90
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,280
with you guys these days?

91
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:08,600
Our

92
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,080
informant in the Portuguese police reported that

93
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,640
something happened today.

94
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,080
A special police squad leader from

95
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,040
the Sanzao Island Sixth Air Base

96
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,760
came to Macau with his men.

97
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,960
The Ba Qu guys wanted revenge

98
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,240
and sent people to kill them.

99
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,720
A gunfight broke out

100
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,800
and several people were injured.

101
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,000
What happened then?

102
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,720
Well,

103
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,560
the action team from Macau Rong Agency

104
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:32,480
rescued them.

105
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,090
The assassination failed.

106
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,640
How did the Rong Agency people

107
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,370
know about the assassination?

108
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:39,480
The information must have leaked.

109
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,280
The Ba Qu guys from Anlan Hall

110
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,220
aren't very careful with their operations.

111
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,610
Make arrangements.

112
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,120
I'll go to Anlan Hall.

113
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,520
Now?

114
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,640
Right now.

115
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,480
Let's do this.

116
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,840
Quickly contact our people on the island first

117
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,400
and clarify the situation.

118
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,410
What's the story with the Japanese

119
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,160
lifting the maritime ban?

120
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,000
Who exactly is allowed to go to sea

121
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,880
and when are they permitted to do so?

122
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,760
After going out to sea,

123
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,040
are there any gunboats monitoring the island?

124
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:35,480
Go find out about these things.

125
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:36,040
Yes,

126
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,560
I'll take care of it right away.

127
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,920
I'm thinking

128
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,080
if this is true,

129
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,240
perhaps we can make good use of it.

130
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,250
Once we figure everything out,

131
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,600
we might be able to get

132
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,600
my brother's family off the island.

133
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,720
Sir,

134
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,280
what if it's a trap?

135
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,000
Well,

136
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,640
I also have a bad feeling

137
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,920
that something might be wrong with this.

138
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,960
Indeed,

139
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,720
when have the Japanese on the island

140
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,160
ever shown such kindness?

141
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,640
They've actually lifted the sea ban

142
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,760
and allowed villagers to go fishing.

143
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,240
This is just too strange.

144
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,060
First, contact the people on the island.

145
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,640
Keep it quiet.

146
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,600
Mr. Ye.

147
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,080
Director Shen from the National Government has arrived.

148
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,960
Mr. Ye.

149
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,840
Hello.

150
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:42,080
Director Shen.

151
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,280
I was just about to send someone for you.

152
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,000
What brings you here in such a hurry?

153
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,800
Is it urgent?

154
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,760
What a coincidence.

155
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,760
I just returned to Macau from out of town.

156
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,360
I heard that the Sanzao Island's

157
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,200
special police captain has arrived in Macau.

158
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,000
Is that right?

159
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,860
We've brought our men right away.

160
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:56,080
News travels fast.

161
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,600
Don't mind.

162
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,640
Our Military Intelligence has some informants

163
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,570
in the Portuguese police in Macau.

164
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,320
Director Shen.

165
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,040
You're one step too late.

166
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,080
That Japanese special police captain

167
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,320
got away from us.

168
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,840
What a shame.

169
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:41,720
Mr. Ye.

170
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,960
I understand.

171
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,360
I have something to say

172
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,720
that you might not like.

173
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,840
I'm a straightforward man.

174
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,200
Please speak freely.

175
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,160
Your operation failed

176
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,400
because there must be

177
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:56,780
a Japanese spy among your District 8 men.

178
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,200
Impossible.

179
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,880
Among my District 8 men,

180
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,140
there are no such cowards as you suggest.

181
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,640
Macau today

182
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,920
is like Shanghai's isolated island in the past,

183
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:12,120
where spies from all over the world operate.

184
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,600
They

185
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,800
gather military intelligence on each other,

186
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,360
exchange benefits,

187
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,200
and raise war funds.

188
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,520
Of course.

189
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,540
There are usually situations like this.

190
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,240
Our people

191
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,280
might be bought with large sums of money

192
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,720
to work for them.

193
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,520
Similarly,

194
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:35,640
their people

195
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,400
can also be bought by us

196
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,800
to work for us.

197
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,840
We've dealt with

198
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,100
situations like this many times before.

199
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,200
So I'm certain

200
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:46,560
that your operation's failure

201
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,760
must be due to an inside problem.

202
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,480
How can you be so sure?

203
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,280
Mr. Ye,

204
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,600
if necessary,

205
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,930
our Military Statistics Bureau can help.

206
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:01,640
Impossible.

207
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:04,960
You're overthinking this.

208
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,200
Perhaps I am overthinking it.

209
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:12,280
Come in.

210
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,340
Please have a seat.

211
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,760
Director Shen, you're well-informed.

212
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,960
I need to ask you something.

213
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,200
There's a rumor

214
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,640
going around outside.

215
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,240
Sanzao Island

216
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,840
will soon lift its maritime ban.

217
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,480
They're planning to allow

218
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,940
the island's fishermen to go fishing at sea.

219
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,160
Do you think this is reliable?

220
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,480
I'm sorry,

221
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,940
but what does lifting the maritime ban mean?

222
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,360
Since February of 1938,

223
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,640
after the Japanese occupied Sanzao Island,

224
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,000
they established naval and air force bases there

225
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,360
and have forbidden fishermen from going to sea,

226
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,040
for four or five years now.

227
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,920
Outsiders can't get in,

228
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,570
and insiders can't get out.

229
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,760
Now this news suddenly comes out.

230
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,760
I'm also very surprised.

231
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,359
Interesting.

232
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:08,280
Four or five years.

233
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,560
This is indeed suspicious.

234
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,650
We should definitely look into it.

235
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,480
Do you have any thoughts?

236
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,599
Some gentry from Sanzao Island

237
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:23,040
who fled to Macau have approached me.

238
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,200
They want to use this opportunity

239
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:27,839
to rescue

240
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,160
their families from the island.

241
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,760
But I think,

242
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,600
if this is true,

243
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,120
perhaps I could also

244
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,520
bring my brother's family

245
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,800
here to Macau.

246
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,000
I understand.

247
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,480
Don't worry,

248
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,120
our colleagues at the Macau station

249
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,920
will investigate immediately.

250
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,250
If there's any news,

251
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,720
I'll get back to you as soon as possible.

252
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,520
I'll count on you then.

253
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,320
If this is true,

254
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,380
I need to start making preparations.

255
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,160
Then I'll take my leave.

256
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:06,240
Goodbye.

257
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,520
Thank you.

258
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:17,880
Lao Yi.

259
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,400
Sir.

260
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,840
This Director Shen from the government suspects

261
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,560
that our assassination attempt failed

262
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,760
because someone

263
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,330
inside our organization is a traitor.

264
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,720
A traitor?

265
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,160
That can't be.

266
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,080
When he said that,

267
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,320
my heart sank.

268
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,640
Logically speaking,

269
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,440
very few people knew about this.

270
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,160
How could the Japanese intelligence

271
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,820
have gotten the information?

272
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,200
In that case,

273
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,640
this matter

274
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,560
is indeed suspicious.

275
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,120
Do you think

276
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:19,720
among the people around us lately,

277
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,000
anyone seems off?

278
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,520
Is it him?

279
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,920
Don't say his name.

280
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:42,160
I know who you're talking about.

281
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,920
Keep this quiet.

282
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,840
Investigate secretly.

283
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,360
If you find anything suspicious,

284
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,640
find a way to test him.

285
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,480
Understood.

286
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,920
Mr. Rong sent me to thank you.

287
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,400
Working for Mr. Rong

288
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,880
will be worth your while.

289
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:12,380
I don't want the money.

290
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:15,760
I'll pay whatever I owe you,

291
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,480
every damn cent.

292
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:20,520
Don't be so impulsive.

293
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,120
Cut the crap.

294
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,560
From now on,

295
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,560
we go our separate ways,

296
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,200
like we never met.

297
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,720
Fine.

298
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,400
Then I'll take all these things

299
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,040
to Mr. Ye right now

300
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,440
and see what he has to say.

301
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,920
I swear I could

302
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,850
put a bullet in your head right now.

303
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,800
Rong Zezuo's name

304
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,600
must be familiar to you.

305
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,400
Do you think

306
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,960
he would let you off easily?

307
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,160
Don't burn your bridges.

308
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:03,600
Anything related to Brother Geng,

309
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,200
I'd rather die

310
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,600
than get involved again.

311
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,360
It's not that complicated.

312
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,960
You just need to help us

313
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,480
with one last thing.

314
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,840
Not only will your gambling debts be wiped clean,

315
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,560
but we guarantee

316
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:19,020
we won't bother you again.

317
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,320
What is it?

318
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,520
Between Anlan Hall and Sanzao Island,

319
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:45,760
there's a secret passage.

320
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,480
Mr. Rong wants you

321
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,160
to find it as soon as possible.

322
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,240
Just that?

323
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,760
That's all.

324
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,800
New stock has arrived.

325
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,480
Boss,

326
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:19,340
let Xiang'er join you for a smoke.

327
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,360
Always about the money.

328
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,640
Dad.

329
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:02,370
Uncle sent a letter.

330
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,530
What does it say?

331
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,220
Uncle is asking about lifting the maritime ban.

332
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,720
News has already reached Macau.

333
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,120
He's asking for specific details.

334
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:14,760
What exactly is this

335
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,160
about lifting the maritime ban?

336
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,420
Who is allowed to sail?

337
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,560
When can they sail?

338
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,080
After sailing,

339
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,080
will there be gunboats monitoring?

340
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,020
Don't rush to reply to your uncle.

341
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,880
Take this letter.

342
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,970
Wait for your sister to return.

343
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:31,280
Have her give it to Wu Mu

344
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,480
so he can take a look.

345
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,930
I'll go find Tang Bingchen.

346
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,760
I've thought about this matter.

347
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,000
It's not that simple.

348
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,160
You're finally back.

349
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,160
How did it go?

350
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,620
Did you make up with Ju'er?

351
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,880
Why are you alone?

352
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:40,930
Where's Dad?

353
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,360
Dad took Fourth Aunt

354
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,200
to Tang Bingchen's house

355
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,060
to ask about the fishing permits.

356
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:45,800
By the way,

357
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,860
take a look at this.

358
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,890
This came today,

359
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,280
a letter from my uncle

360
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,280
in Macau.

361
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,770
What does Uncle say?

362
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,140
It's all there.

363
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,600
The news about lifting the maritime ban

364
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,130
has already reached Macau.

365
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,640
How did the news spread so quickly?

366
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,480
Oshima Hiroshi just left Macau,

367
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,600
and immediately everyone there knows about it.

368
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,060
The timing is suspicious.

369
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,280
It seems this matter

370
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,940
truly involves a conspiracy.

371
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,120
If there is a conspiracy,

372
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,960
you'll figure it out, right?

373
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,320
Ying'er.

374
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,560
Don't worry yet.

375
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,640
When Dad returns,

376
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,300
we'll have more information.

377
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,040
I originally planned to use the lifting of the ban

378
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,360
to get the Major out.

379
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,320
Now it seems

380
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,720
if this is Oshima's plot,

381
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,720
we can't take that risk anymore.

382
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:28,920
You'll handle it,

383
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:30,200
won't you?

384
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,080
I understand

385
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,080
that lifting the maritime ban

386
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,520
could be a trap.

387
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,920
The Macau resistance fighters

388
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,450
will go to sea to rescue people no matter what.

389
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:42,120
But my mission

390
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,120
is only to rescue the Believer,

391
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:46,760
return the codes and radio beacon,

392
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,840
and leave with Ye Biying.

393
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,840
If I get involved in this matter,

394
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,240
will it affect

395
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,960
my operations on the island?

396
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,480
This afternoon,

397
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,400
Oshima Hiroshi returned from Macau.

398
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,480
They've already had someone perform an autopsy on

399
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,840
Inoue Kamakura's body.

400
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,600
I believe starting tomorrow morning,

401
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,920
the island's special police unit

402
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,520
will launch a large-scale investigation.

403
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,240
So tonight,

404
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,560
I must see Tang Ju'er

405
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,200
to clarify

406
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,720
everything that happened at the hospital today.

407
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:10,280
Alright,

408
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,280
I'll go get her now.

409
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,800
Don't let her father know all the information.

410
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:13,600
Don't worry.

411
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,160
Excuse me.

412
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,060
Please help yourself.

413
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,480
Sir.

414
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,480
This afternoon,

415
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,200
Oshima Hiroshi and his men

416
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,730
returned early from Macau.

417
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,120
After he came back,

418
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,080
what did he do?

419
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,280
He's been busy investigating

420
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,810
the cause of Deputy Commander Inoue's death.

421
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,400
Did he find anything?

422
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,280
Not yet.

423
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,840
They requested the military hospital

424
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,700
to perform an autopsy on the body.

425
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,170
What was the cause of death?

426
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,210
I asked the military hospital.

427
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,480
The cause of death is most likely

428
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,520
Deputy Commander Inoue driving while intoxicated,

429
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,980
resulting in an accident.

430
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,240
This man had

431
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,960
the manners of a ronin.

432
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:39,880
The navy never welcomed officers like him.

433
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,880
By the way,

434
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:45,280
after Commander Oshima returned,

435
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,520
he ordered the execution of

436
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,920
a prisoner they were holding.

437
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,400
Who was executed?

438
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,080
That old fortune teller

439
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,640
from Tanjiawan Village.

440
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,320
They say this old man

441
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,840
had already predicted that Deputy Commander Inoue

442
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,240
would die in a fire.

443
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,720
Don't mind them.

444
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,320
Regarding Inoue Kamakura's matter,

445
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,480
Oshima Hiroshi has lost his composure.

446
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,080
Yes.

447
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,960
This man is a typical

448
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,960
ruthless character who lets nothing stand in his way.

449
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,760
Your secret investigation of Oshima Hiroshi,

450
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,920
do you have any conclusions?

451
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,720
Not yet.

452
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,200
We haven't yet discovered Commander Oshima's

453
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,860
connection with the domestic control faction.

454
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:26,720
What is the Colonel doing today?

455
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,640
The Colonel

456
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:29,320
has gathered several officers

457
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:30,040
who participated in General Daikaku Minoo's

458
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,480
security detail

459
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,560
for questioning.

460
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:34,620
He's continuing his investigation.

461
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,040
I understand.

462
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,560
Also,

463
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,960
the additional

464
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,000
two patrol ships for Da Hengqin Island have arrived.

465
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,280
As per your instructions,

466
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,480
they have been assigned to

467
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,680
the 56th Regiment on Da Hengqin Island.

468
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,480
In the next couple of days,

469
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,360
prepare to visit Da Hengqin Island.

470
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,560
I understand.

471
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,040
Headquarters won't interfere with

472
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,840
the investigation into Deputy Commander Inoue's death.

473
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,880
We've lost an officer,

474
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,920
and I also want to know the truth.

475
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,400
De Gong.

476
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,240
Bingchen.

477
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,360
De Gong.

478
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,360
The other day,

479
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,280
I drank too much

480
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,000
and behaved inappropriately.

481
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,160
For any offense,

482
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,680
please forgive me, De Gong.

483
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,320
Can we talk inside?

484
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,160
Bingchen,

485
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,000
let's put aside the matter

486
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,000
of our children's marriage for now.

487
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,120
I've come to see you today

488
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,120
to discuss something concerning

489
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,760
the fate of everyone on this island.

490
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,340
Important matter.

491
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,260
This lifting of the sea ban

492
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:57,940
to fish in the open sea.

493
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,240
Have you

494
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,400
asked Translator Luo about this matter?

495
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,460
It's approaching.

496
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,410
The time is almost here.

497
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,000
I've already asked about it.

498
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,080
Translator Luo said

499
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,480
that the police squad

500
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,320
indeed submitted a report

501
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,720
to Fujita.

502
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,760
After receiving the report, Fujita

503
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,690
locked it in his safe immediately.

504
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,960
No one knows the specific contents.

505
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,960
No other news?

506
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:27,960
None.

507
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,000
Fujita hasn't mentioned

508
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,880
anything about this report to Translator Luo.

509
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,560
Did you try to sound him out?

510
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,680
Translator Luo said

511
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,010
lifting the sea ban should be a good thing,

512
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,240
there shouldn't be any major problems.

513
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,760
A good thing?

514
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,040
I don't think so.

515
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,560
If it's such a good thing,

516
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,560
then why aren't there any

517
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,540
Japanese pioneers on their list?

518
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,240
Why are they all Chinese villagers

519
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:59,120
and all able-bodied men?

520
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:02,800
Degong,

521
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,640
aren't you

522
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,840
being too sensitive?

523
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,160
How can I not be sensitive?

524
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,640
We've already made one mistake.

525
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,600
Can we afford to make another?

526
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,040
It can't be that serious.

527
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,240
The Japanese lifting the sea ban

528
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,890
is also meant to improve

529
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,260
the lives of people on the island.

530
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,520
Bingchen,

531
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:24,650
since our ancestors

532
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:27,360
moved to this island,

533
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,160
their only thought

534
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,800
was how to survive

535
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,000
and continue our lineage.

536
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,880
So everyone on the island knows

537
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,600
we must work together,

538
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,880
stick together

539
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,400
to survive.

540
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,240
So for the islanders,

541
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,520
human life

542
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,930
is more important than anything else.

543
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:50,680
Life at sea is dangerous,

544
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:53,080
only in storms do you see people's true colors.

545
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,680
If they go out to sea this time

546
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,490
and our villagers don't come back,

547
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,800
what should we do?

548
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,240
It's been three years since the massacre.

549
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,080
The island

550
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,720
is calm now.

551
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:10,200
The Japanese have no reason

552
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,400
to harm the islanders again, right?

553
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,720
Bingchen,

554
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,560
why do you think

555
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,560
the Japanese are

556
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:19,320
so kind and good?

557
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,380
Would they care about our fishermen?

558
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:23,680
Would they?

559
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,400
Three years ago,

560
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,640
they used the pretext of issuing good citizen certificates

561
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,640
and had you go door to door summoning people.

562
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:35,240
Once you brought people out,

563
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,530
they immediately began the massacre.

564
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:38,760
Now,

565
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:40,880
they're having you drum up support

566
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,010
to organize fishermen to go out to sea.

567
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,640
Think about it.

568
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,400
This situation

569
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,840
compared to the last massacre,

570
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,170
what's the difference?

571
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,320
Let me tell you.

572
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,960
If history repeats itself,

573
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,280
you'll be an accomplice to tyranny,

574
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,680
an unforgivable sinner.

575
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:58,960
Mr. De,

576
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:00,920
what should I do?

577
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,320
About lifting the sea ban

578
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:09,410
we must get all the details.

579
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,040
We need to find out

580
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,480
if everyone on the list

581
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:15,080
has to go to sea.

582
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:17,210
When will they set sail?

583
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,600
After they go out to sea,

584
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,000
will there be patrol boats

585
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,660
following and watching them?

586
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:22,960
If there are,

587
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,810
then I'm almost certain

588
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,120
this will be a massacre at sea.

589
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:33,840
Then I'll go ask Translator Luo again.

590
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,480
After all, he's Chinese.

591
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,400
He wouldn't just stand by

592
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,930
when someone's in trouble.

593
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,680
Bingchen,

594
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,170
I'm counting on you.

595
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:44,640
Degong.

596
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,600
After the autopsy,

597
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,400
what conclusion did they reach?

598
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,930
They determined the time of death.

599
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,360
13 hours ago,

600
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:57,480
between 4 and 5 PM yesterday.

601
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,000
That's when you were at the hospital.

602
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,600
What else?

603
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,080
Also,

604
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,040
there was no trace of smoke inhalation

605
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,199
in his tracheal walls.

606
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,280
This means

607
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,800
he had already stopped breathing

608
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:15,239
before the motorcycle caught fire.

609
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,889
That's why he didn't inhale any smoke.

610
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:21,880
There's more.

611
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:23,040
Don't panic. What else?

612
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:23,639
Also,

613
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:28,120
they said

614
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,679
they found alcohol in his stomach.

615
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:32,540
Which means he had been drinking.

616
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:34,320
Go on.

617
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:35,239
What else?

618
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:43,120
They said he died from asphyxiation

619
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,330
due to a broken cervical vertebra.

620
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,719
But the doctor said

621
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,719
it could have been broken in the fall.

622
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,560
That's all.

623
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,920
You're a doctor too.

624
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,980
What do you think of this conclusion?

625
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,280
Don't worry,

626
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,410
there's another possibility.

627
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:04,520
Suppose Inoue

628
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,080
landed headfirst

629
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,610
when he fell from the cliff.

630
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,600
It's possible that

631
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,320
his neck broke,

632
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,780
causing him to suffocate.

633
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,800
If he died first,

634
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,560
and the motorcycle caught fire afterward,

635
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,600
that would explain

636
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:17,800
why there was no smoke

637
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,720
in his airways.

638
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,240
This conclusion

639
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,640
is very favorable for us.

640
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,960
Oshima Hiroshi knows

641
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,920
that Inoue came to the hospital

642
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,320
after being bitten.

643
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,160
And his wound

644
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:37,360
was treated by me.

645
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,960
When you were treating his wound,

646
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,800
was anyone else present?

647
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,400
Dr. Ozu.

648
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,360
Tang Ju'er,

649
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:50,960
from now on,

650
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,400
I hope you can calmly

651
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,680
listen to what I'm about to say.

652
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,840
Can you do that?

653
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,560
Early tomorrow morning,

654
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,200
the special police unit will launch

655
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,930
a large-scale investigation.

656
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,040
Soon,

657
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:04,000
they will find

658
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,400
the person who bit Inoue.

659
00:36:05,560 --> 00:36:06,480
Then they'll discover

660
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,600
that Inoue arrived at the base hospital

661
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,280
at a time

662
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,400
around 4 or 5 in the afternoon,

663
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,280
which is exactly when we were at the hospital.

664
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,520
Our time at the hospital

665
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,760
coincides perfectly with Inoue's time of death.

666
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,000
This will become the focus

667
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,320
of Oshima Hiroshi's investigation.

668
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,360
What should we do?

669
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:22,400
Don't panic.

670
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:24,400
They will soon discover

671
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,040
that Inoue Kamakura was alive

672
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,240
and left the base hospital

673
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,600
riding his own motorcycle.

674
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,400
This fact

675
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,400
can be verified by the guards at the checkpoint.

676
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,400
This way,

677
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,400
the theory that the base hospital

678
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,120
was the primary scene of Inoue Kamakura's death

679
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,360
becomes invalid.

680
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,840
So the Special Police Unit

681
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,680
will soon trace

682
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,880
to Ju'er?

683
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,680
Yes.

684
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:45,840
Ju'er,

685
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,480
someone will definitely come to question you tomorrow.

686
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,720
But if the person questioning you

687
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,000
isn't Oshima Hiroshi himself

688
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,640
but one of his officers,

689
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:53,400
then we're

690
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,720
halfway to success.

691
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,720
But

692
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,760
if Japanese people come to question me,

693
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,600
what should I say?

694
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:02,320
That's why it's best

695
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,080
if Dr. Ozu is present

696
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,600
when they question you.

697
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,400
His testimony

698
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,080
will be very helpful to you.

699
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,160
Dr. Ozu.

700
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,960
Don't be afraid, Ju'er.

701
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,360
How about this,

702
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,280
I'll go to the hospital tomorrow too.

703
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:15,360
You can't go.

704
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,360
If you go,

705
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,520
it would be like announcing our guilt.

706
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,000
What about you?

707
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,080
I will go.

708
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:22,720
I'll bring

709
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,720
officers from the anti-aircraft artillery unit with me.

710
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,120
In the Huangyang Mountain battle,

711
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,400
many soldiers from the anti-aircraft unit

712
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:28,560
were wounded.

713
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:29,120
So it makes sense

714
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,880
for me to visit and comfort them.

715
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:31,680
Won't this attract

716
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,360
the attention of the Special Police Unit?

717
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,960
That's exactly what I want.

718
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,800
To draw

719
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,080
all their attention to me.

720
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:37,960
This way,

721
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,360
it will reduce their focus

722
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,760
on the Major and Ju'er.

723
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:44,240
Ju'er,

724
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:46,920
did you remember everything I said?

725
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,840
You should do it like this,

726
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,120
you idiot.

727
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:09,840
Are you out of your mind?

728
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,840
I'm sorry,

729
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,300
I can't even handle this simple task.

730
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,300
You should place it like this.

731
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,360
Do you know that Inoue is dead?

732
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,360
I'm sorry.

733
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,090
What on earth are you thinking?

734
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,650
What on earth are you thinking?

735
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,410
Captain, please calm down.

736
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:30,760
Go now!

737
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,040
Go now!

738
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,040
Yes.

739
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:46,120
Captain,

740
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,400
get some rest.

741
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,760
Sasaki.

742
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,560
What do you think of these photos?

743
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,500
It's absolutely impossible.

744
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,160
One person couldn't have done this alone.

745
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:18,400
How did it come to this?

746
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,960
Sasaki.

747
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,600
This is our most dangerous moment.

748
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,080
We must maintain

749
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,920
the highest level of vigilance.

750
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,080
What are you doing?

751
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,280
Stop drinking.

752
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,760
Will drinking more solve anything?

753
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:31,040
Just leave me alone.

754
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,000
Father.

755
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,880
I know why you're troubled.

756
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,480
Listen to me just once.

757
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:43,250
Don't go down the wrong path again.

758
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,200
Do you think I want to make mistakes?

759
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,850
I'm afraid something will happen.

760
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,520
Just like last time.

761
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,560
If that happens,

762
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,640
how could we father and daughter

763
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:59,480
show our faces on this island anymore?

764
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:00,960
I would become

765
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,720
a sinner for all eternity.

766
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,600
Then don't go again.

767
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,640
I don't want to go.
