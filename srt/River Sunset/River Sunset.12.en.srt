1
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,600
This sketch.

2
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,960
This is the courtyard,

3
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,400
and this is the front hall,

4
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,720
and the back hall.

5
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,800
The key point is.

6
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:53,920
We need to build

7
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,320
a secret

8
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,440
basement in this courtyard.

9
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,600
Right here.

10
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,240
This officer speaks quite politely.

11
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,680
Then let me show you.

12
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,079
Oh my!

13
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,280
Building a house beside the police station

14
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,420
is a poor location choice.

15
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:56,920
It's off.

16
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,770
Completely off.

17
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,400
Even if you build the house here,

18
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,730
it would still be crooked and unbalanced.

19
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,000
In my humble opinion,

20
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,000
you should place your courtyard

21
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,960
behind the brigade headquarters.

22
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,840
What do you think?

23
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,960
All right.

24
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,240
Then, sir, please take a look

25
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,920
and see if there are any feng shui issues.

26
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,760
Let me show you again.

27
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,600
This underground chamber of yours

28
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,280
isn't suitable here at all.

29
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,600
It's neither safe

30
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,600
nor secure.

31
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,640
It should be centrally located.

32
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,320
Central.

33
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:41,400
What I mean is

34
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,400
we should put it

35
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,320
beneath the front hall.

36
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,890
It's the safest option.

37
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,840
How do you know

38
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,200
there are buildings like this on the island?

39
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:57,840
Yes, there are.

40
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,320
The Ye family's old house.

41
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,050
Those houses are quite similar to this building.

42
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,400
When they were building the house back then,

43
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,600
I was the one who did the feng shui consultation for them.

44
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,320
I see.

45
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,520
Is their secret room

46
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:12,050
also beneath the main hall?

47
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,360
It seems you were right.

48
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,400
Back then,

49
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,200
I did go to see it.

50
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,320
But it's been so long,

51
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,640
I am confused,

52
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,120
I'm afraid I can't remember clearly.

53
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,320
It's alright.

54
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:40,960
Thank you.

55
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,240
Thank you.

56
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,780
Captain, you're really good.

57
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:01,320
That old guy gave in right away.

58
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,400
Lock this person up.

59
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,360
Until we solve

60
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,640
all the secrets of the hidden rooms on the island,

61
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,840
don't let him go back.

62
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:12,960
We move tomorrow.

63
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:37,850
Captain.

64
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:38,600
What is it?

65
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,690
There seems to be smoke over there.

66
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,720
Let's go check it out.

67
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,400
Captain.

68
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,720
On this entire island, the only person who doesn't hide from us

69
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,120
is just this guy, right?

70
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,360
What's wrong?

71
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,170
Give me a cigarette.

72
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:22,160
Sure.

73
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,080
Captain, have you started smoking?

74
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,920
What are you doing?

75
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,920
Don't hurt him.

76
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,330
Give me the matches.

77
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,240
Give them to me.

78
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,080
Tell me

79
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,200
where you got this.

80
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,520
Give it to me.

81
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:29,840
Hand it over.

82
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,970
Where did you get it?

83
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,520
Who gave it to you?

84
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,250
Give it here.

85
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,320
Are you going to tell me or not?

86
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:47,560
Where did you find it?

87
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,740
All right then.

88
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,320
Let's play a game,

89
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,370
shall we?

90
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,650
I'll hide it.

91
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,520
You find it.

92
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:58,600
Hmm.

93
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,000
If you find it one more time,

94
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,330
I'll give it back to you.

95
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,490
Turn him around.

96
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,600
Give it to me.

97
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:19,930
Turn around.

98
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:25,560
Pick it up.

99
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,920
No.

100
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,490
Turn around.

101
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:03,720
Again.

102
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,240
No.

103
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,520
One more time.

104
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,400
Give it to me.

105
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,540
What are you doing?

106
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,730
Turn him around.

107
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,680
He's just pretending to be stupid.

108
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,560
How could he

109
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,280
guess it was in your pocket so quickly?

110
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,960
He must be faking it.

111
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,730
Can't you see it yet?

112
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,160
Perhaps he picked it up from an American's pocket.

113
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:56,720
Inoue,

114
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,460
have someone secretly watch him.

115
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,540
I want to see

116
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,280
besides us,

117
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,000
who else on this island

118
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,460
would be interested in an American lighter.

119
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:07,480
Understood.

120
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:10,730
Captain,

121
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,140
what's the situation?

122
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,280
Reporting, Captain.

123
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,920
Colonel Wumu went to the Ye family early this morning.

124
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,000
We've been waiting outside.

125
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,130
We didn't dare to take any rash action.

126
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,500
This stinking old man.

127
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,880
He thinks that because his daughter

128
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,940
is involved with a Japanese officer,

129
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,200
he has protection now.

130
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,800
He thinks we wouldn't dare to search his place.

131
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:33,600
Let's go.

132
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,800
Let's go.

133
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,520
This is an American Bristol-Myers Squibb Company

134
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:44,000
morphine syringe.

135
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,180
It's exclusively used by the U.S. military.

136
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,700
I found it at Fourth Aunt's house.

137
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:13,680
Mr. Ye,

138
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,080
I hope you can tell us

139
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,000
everything you know about this person.

140
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,160
Mr. Wumu,

141
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,800
you really are a terrible negotiator.

142
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,490
You're not a good actor either.

143
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,000
You're playing dumb too thoroughly,

144
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,480
which makes it easy to see through sometimes.

145
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,540
Just a few days ago,

146
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,080
an American military aircraft

147
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,680
crashed near Sanzao Island.

148
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,800
An American pilot parachuted

149
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,400
and landed on Sanzao Island.

150
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,200
This morphine syringe is what he carried with him.

151
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,560
He was severely injured, wasn't he?

152
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,640
I've heard about this plane crash.

153
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,540
But whether there was an American pilot,

154
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,000
if there was any American,

155
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,840
I'm not sure.

156
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,680
You should ask your commander.

157
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:10,640
Dad,

158
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,490
we came back to the island for this matter.

159
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,080
Japanese soldiers have entered the village again,

160
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,520
and they seem to be heading toward our house.

161
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,180
Dad, don't you believe me yet?

162
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,240
Are you going to just watch the American

163
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,040
get captured by those Japanese?

164
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,080
Mr. Ye,

165
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,520
even if you don't want to take us to see him,

166
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,600
the police squad has arrived now,

167
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,130
and they're coming for him.

168
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,600
If we don't move him away in time,

169
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,080
do you want to see him get caught?

170
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,340
Wumu is here to help us.

171
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:53,600
There's something I've never told you.

172
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,760
Wumu killed a Japanese soldier for me.

173
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,680
Oh no, what should we do?

174
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:03,040
Colonel, what happened?

175
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,320
Captain Oshima.

176
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,560
I was driving along

177
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,640
when it suddenly started smoking here.

178
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,720
So I pulled over.

179
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,320
I don't know what's wrong,

180
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,580
but it won't start now.

181
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:13,800
Come here.

182
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,600
Fix it for the Colonel.

183
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,130
Yes, sir.

184
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,280
Hello, Miss Ye.

185
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:22,800
Colonel.

186
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,200
Yes?

187
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,140
You just came from Mr. Ye's house, right?

188
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,460
I went to Miss Ye's home

189
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,280
to take her back to the barracks.

190
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,760
Why do you have so many men with you?

191
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,960
Do you have a mission?

192
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,210
I wonder if the tire is damaged.

193
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:38,160
The tires should be fine.

194
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,000
The tire should be fine.

195
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,680
Captain,

196
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,610
stop wasting time with him.

197
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,520
Let's hurry and search the Ye family's secret room.

198
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,560
Seems like I'm running low on cigarettes.

199
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,400
Excellent.

200
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,930
What's under this blanket?

201
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,130
Captain Oshima,

202
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,760
if you have other duties,

203
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,680
please go ahead.

204
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:16,400
I'm fine here.

205
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,800
I can handle this myself.

206
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:21,160
I understand.

207
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,460
Let's help you push it out.

208
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,000
What a hassle.

209
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,520
It's fine now.

210
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:52,920
Thanks.

211
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,040
Thank you.

212
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,690
You're welcome.

213
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,800
I'll be going now.

214
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:58,610
Let's go.

215
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:04,920
Take care.

216
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:51,960
Turn left.

217
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,880
Coming.

218
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,280
Stay calm

219
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,090
and don't do anything rash.

220
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,450
Good morning, Captain.

221
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,050
Major Wumu seems to care about you.

222
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,530
He came early this morning.

223
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,520
He took my daughter to the barracks.

224
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,240
I see.

225
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,080
What are you soldiers doing?

226
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,720
We know that in your house

227
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,900
there is a secret room.

228
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:13,760
Am I right?

229
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,410
What do you want?

230
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,690
We're looking for someone.

231
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,040
Looking for someone?

232
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,640
I only have things hidden in my secret room,

233
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:32,960
not people.

234
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,580
Once it's open,

235
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,320
we'll see for ourselves.

236
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,280
Well,

237
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,920
will you open it for us

238
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:43,120
or

239
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,820
shall we break it down?

240
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:48,840
What are you doing?

241
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,280
What do you think you're doing?

242
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,080
Don't come in!

243
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,480
Xia'er!

244
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,760
Take them to the secret room.

245
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,240
Captain.

246
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,480
There are only items inside, no people.

247
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:12,930
What is this?

248
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,840
Probably their ancestors.

249
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:23,280
Sasaki.

250
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,080
What seems off to you?

251
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,620
What seems off to you, sir?

252
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:36,760
The basement.

253
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,840
It should smell like a basement.

254
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,080
The stale air.

255
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,840
But there isn't any here.

256
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:46,650
Check. And also,

257
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,290
there's something else in the air.

258
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:51,960
You mean...

259
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,400
human scent?

260
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,200
Someone has been living here.

261
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,400
Captain Oshima.

262
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,560
If you have other duties,

263
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,490
please go ahead.

264
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,280
I'm fine here.

265
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,680
I can handle this myself.

266
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:12,240
Inoue.

267
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,740
You stay here with two men.

268
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,760
Sasaki, come with me.

269
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,690
Let's catch up with Major Wumu.

270
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,770
Everyone withdraw!

271
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,810
Where are you going?

272
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,400
Back to the barracks first.

273
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,330
To the barracks?

274
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,240
He's severely wounded right now.

275
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,700
We need to find him and get him medical treatment immediately.

276
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,620
What are you doing?

277
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,410
Where are you going?

278
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,080
Are you even listening to me?

279
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,100
What are you doing?

280
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,080
I said he's seriously injured.

281
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,280
He needs immediate medical attention.

282
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,220
What are you doing?

283
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,220
They should be following us soon.

284
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:43,960
Who?

285
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:45,920
Our tail.

286
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:50,920
Then what are you doing?

287
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,960
Are we going or not?

288
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,560
Let's go.

289
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,290
Are you sure?

290
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,480
Whatever. It's up to you.

291
00:25:59,280 --> 00:25:59,800
[Military 08596]

292
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,160
[Military 08596]

293
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,160
[Military 08596]

294
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,010
Captain Oshima.

295
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,450
Colonel.

296
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,610
You're just in time.

297
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,530
Do me a favor.

298
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:23,940
Help me out.

299
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,700
Great, thanks.

300
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,410
A little higher.

301
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,530
A little higher.

302
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,160
Higher.

303
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:35,840
Lower.

304
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,140
Try putting it on that pillar over there.

305
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,560
Never mind.

306
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,160
Bring it back here.

307
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:43,820
Put it here.

308
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,520
Good, right here.

309
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,560
Don't move.

310
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:23,880
Thank you.

311
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,640
You came to see me for something?

312
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,280
We're headed to the defense unit.

313
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:30,920
We just happened to see you, Colonel,

314
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:32,520
so we stopped by to say hello.

315
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,400
I'm sorry

316
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:34,240
for taking up your time.

317
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,000
You should get back to your business.

318
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,760
Thank you. I'll be going now.

319
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:38,840
Wait,

320
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,770
Captain Oshima.

321
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,500
Here you go.

322
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:41,600
Thank you.

323
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,180
Captain, are we looking in the wrong direction?

324
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,740
Freshwater Supplementary Investigation Headquarters.

325
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,820
What is this colonel really here for?

326
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,800
Mr. Oshima from Sanzao Island called last night.

327
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,880
He wants us to investigate

328
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,540
everything about this woman.

329
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,920
This must be the woman

330
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,450
that the colonel took away.

331
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,610
I also think something's suspicious.

332
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,320
Yes.

333
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,480
This woman is called Ye Biying.

334
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,160
The investigation leads to Guotai Ballroom.

335
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,680
She's a dance hostess.

336
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,440
Arrange it immediately.

337
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:29,520
Conduct a thorough secret investigation.

338
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:30,760
Yes.

339
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,160
Find out her occupation and residence,

340
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,160
her connections in Shanghai,

341
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,280
her social activities,

342
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,160
when she got involved with that envoy from the palace,

343
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,920
and started associating with him.

344
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,050
Investigate everything suspicious.

345
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:46,320
Yes,

346
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,090
I'll arrange it right away.

347
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:49,000
Remember.

348
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:52,120
Remember to keep the investigation secret.

349
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:55,080
Don't let the Intelligence Section of Shanghai Garrison know about this.

350
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:58,810
That colonel has deep connections with the Intelligence Section.

351
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,760
Understood.

352
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,600
Boss, she's gone.

353
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,800
Follow her.

354
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,560
Yes.

355
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,650
Come with me.

356
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,660
Search carefully.

357
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,520
Yes.

358
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,460
These are some of the woman's documents.

359
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,280
This is her medical record from Yongle Hospital.

360
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,480
This appears to be a food ration card.

361
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:18,400
And there's also a record

362
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,480
of her buying rice at the shop over ten days ago.

363
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,680
Take photos of these.

364
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,730
Go verify this information immediately.

365
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,480
Shopkeeper,

366
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:00,920
I'd like to ask you something.

367
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:01,640
Go ahead.

368
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,330
Do you know this person?

369
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,320
I don't know her.

370
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,200
Never seen her before.

371
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:13,920
Think carefully.

372
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:14,480
This person

373
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,640
came to your rice shop about two weeks ago.

374
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,040
How can you not remember?

375
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:20,320
I wouldn't dare lie.

376
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,760
I might have seen her.

377
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,620
So many customers come to the shop every day.

378
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,100
How could I possibly remember everyone?

379
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,680
You really don't remember?

380
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,720
No, I don't.

381
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,400
Any abnormalities?

382
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,480
No.

383
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:46,840
The entire residence,

384
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,160
you didn't find anything suspicious?

385
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,640
Nothing at all.

386
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,600
Did you verify?

387
00:33:52,920 --> 00:33:55,520
Something's not right with the verification.

388
00:33:55,640 --> 00:33:56,920
How so?

389
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,240
The rice shop owner across the street said

390
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,240
he doesn't remember clearly.

391
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,640
He probably didn't recognize this person.

392
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:05,920
How did that woman

393
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,320
get involved with our palace colonel?

394
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,980
Did you investigate the situation at Number 76?

395
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,880
Yes, I did.

396
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,480
Tang Shengming, a councilor from Shanghai government,

397
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,480
is an old acquaintance of this woman named Ye Biying.

398
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,239
After arriving in Shanghai, the colonel seemed to need

399
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,600
a woman from Zhongshan like her.

400
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,719
Tang Shengming introduced them to each other.

401
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:25,400
This has been confirmed.

402
00:34:27,159 --> 00:34:28,120
I understand.

403
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,880
Continue monitoring this woman.

404
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:35,880
You keep watching the Guotai Ballroom.

405
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,719
Find someone who knows the details.

406
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:41,760
Find out everything about this woman

407
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,840
in Shanghai.

408
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,120
Yes, sir.

409
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:00,890
Thank you for your hard work, Captain.

410
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:06,760
Didn't catch them?

411
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:14,640
Didn't you

412
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,120
chase them to the airport barracks?

413
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:22,240
They weren't with the Colonel.

414
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,840
Damn it.

415
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:30,520
We rushed to the Ye family in Tanjiawan,

416
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,320
uncovered the secret room

417
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,940
of that old man we've been suspicious of,

418
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,620
but couldn't find anyone.

419
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,120
That's right.

420
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,280
I brought back everything

421
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,000
from that old man's secret room.

422
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,120
The Captain and I

423
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,680
tracked down Colonel Wumu's residence.

424
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,600
But he was busy with something

425
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,120
completely unrelated to this matter.

426
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:57,800
Setting up his freshwater supply investigation headquarters.

427
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,760
This is very strange.

428
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,480
But shortly after he arrived,

429
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,000
the garrison sentries

430
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,600
mysteriously disappeared.

431
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,120
And the investigation into Tang Ju'er,

432
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,720
he interfered with that too.

433
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:17,480
This guy meddles in everything since arriving on the island,

434
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:19,880
and even put me in confinement for two days.

435
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,210
Control your emotions.

436
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,560
What did you just say?

437
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,280
Freshwater Supply Investigation Headquarters,

438
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:31,760
what kind of strange organization is that?

439
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:34,420
Are they investigating freshwater resources?

440
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,220
The American isn't in the secret room

441
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:42,160
or with the Colonel.

442
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,000
Where could he have gone?

443
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,410
He couldn't have just vanished into thin air.

444
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,360
We've always believed

445
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,490
that woman by his side was suspicious.

446
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,520
But what if

447
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,480
she's not the only suspicious one?

448
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,240
This Oshima Hiroshi

449
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,720
is truly a sly fox.

450
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,560
But his cleverness backfired.

451
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,200
He even helped us relocate the Major,

452
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,600
buying us valuable time.

453
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,360
You did pretty well though,

454
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,760
using his suspicious nature

455
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,240
to mislead him.

456
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,040
Not bad at all.

457
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,930
It's rare to get a compliment from you.

458
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:39,690
You were good today too,

459
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,520
your acting was excellent,

460
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,160
especially those spot-on glances.

461
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,000
Of course.

462
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,200
Today was a close call.

463
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,120
But after this incident,

464
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,580
my father will probably trust you even more.

465
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,560
We'll be meeting the Major soon.

466
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,880
Mr. Wu,

467
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,620
please come in and have a seat.

468
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,920
So,

469
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,930
you were sent by the National Government.

470
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,920
All I can say is

471
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:34,280
we came to Sanzao Island

472
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,890
to safely escort the Major away from here.

473
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,520
As for other details,

474
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,490
the less you know, the safer you'll be.

475
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,480
Thanks to you.

476
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,240
Mr. Wu,

477
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,320
I was too reckless about that matter.

478
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,450
My father has already reprimanded me.

479
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:55,600
There was a misunderstanding between us.

480
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:56,800
I apologize for any offense.

481
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,040
Sorry.

482
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:00,200
Excuse me,

483
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,460
Ye Longxia, the Tiger from the Mountain.

484
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,640
Mr. Ye,

485
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,200
please don't worry about what happened before.

486
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,760
But our most urgent task now

487
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,220
is to meet with the Major as soon as possible.

488
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:19,760
Alright.

489
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:23,760
Come, Major,

490
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:25,040
have something to eat.

491
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,200
We need to relocate.

492
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,800
Where are you taking me?

493
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:38,960
Hang in there.

494
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,960
He's now at

495
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,010
the back mountain of Caotang Village.

496
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,000
Captain Oshima is here.

497
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,640
Let him in.

498
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:22,640
Have you found the missing garrison soldiers?

499
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,000
Not yet.

500
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:30,560
They can't have just vanished into thin air.

501
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,560
We're investigating the case.

502
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,120
Do you have any leads?

503
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:38,240
I had the airport garrison check

504
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,080
the roster of personnel who returned to the barracks the night before last.

505
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,640
The Colonel was on that list.

506
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,360
Are you suggesting that as soon as the Colonel arrived on the island,

507
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,760
he took out

508
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,220
our garrison's sentries?

509
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,600
That's not what I meant.

510
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,160
But as a special police officer,

511
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,420
I can't rule out certain possibilities.

512
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,560
The Colonel came to the island with the Emperor's orders.

513
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,600
Suspecting him lacks motive and purpose.

514
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,320
Are you referring to the Freshwater Supply Investigation Unit?

515
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,840
Our Emperor has sent a Colonel

516
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,250
to Sanzao Island specifically to investigate freshwater.

517
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,840
Why are you asking so many questions?

518
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:17,640
Ye Degong's daughter

519
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:20,880
left this island four years ago.

520
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,640
But this time she returned

521
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,240
as the Colonel's assistant.

522
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,280
Don't you find that strange?

523
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,080
What's strange about it?

524
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:32,200
When she returned to the island,

525
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,280
she was carrying a gun

526
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,320
and we caught her.

527
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,560
Fukuda discovered this.

528
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,740
I'm well aware of this matter.

529
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,640
One of our senior officers

530
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,320
got a gun for her lover's protection.

531
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:45,800
There's nothing to make a fuss about.

532
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,360
Anything else?

533
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,000
We're going to see the Major now.

534
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,800
Check if we're being followed.

535
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,760
Great.

536
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:13,080
According to Inoue's investigation,

537
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,280
they found that in this woman's luggage,

538
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:16,080
all the clothes and accessories

539
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:19,720
don't match her claimed identity.

540
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,200
Commander,

541
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,850
this approach is like that of a spy.
