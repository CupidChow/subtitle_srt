1
00:01:42,039 --> 00:01:43,700
You are Ye Biying, aren't you?

2
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,460
You are Ye Biying, aren't you?

3
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,340
What are you doing?

4
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,560
Let me go!

5
00:01:55,039 --> 00:01:55,840
Let me go!

6
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,920
Shut up and behave!

7
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,680
Stop!

8
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:11,820
What are you doing?

9
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,520
Let her go!

10
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,280
Dad!

11
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,680
Ying!

12
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,520
Dad!

13
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,440
Why did you come back?

14
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,850
Why would you come back during such chaos?

15
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,680
She's my daughter.

16
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,140
Why are you arresting her?

17
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,760
We have some questions for her.

18
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:08,960
She's my daughter.

19
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,890
What's wrong with her coming home?

20
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,880
Do you know who you're talking to?

21
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,040
What?

22
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:19,720
Wait.

23
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,400
I'm sorry.

24
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,000
Listen.

25
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:21,600
I've always told you

26
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,860
not to be so impulsive.

27
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,600
Don't be so impulsive.

28
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:25,280
Get out!

29
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,320
Mr. Ye,

30
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,040
please calm down.

31
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,250
I'm truly sorry.

32
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,760
She's my daughter.

33
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,480
Why are you arresting her?

34
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,400
Yes.

35
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,320
She's your daughter,

36
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:40,760
right?

37
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,440
We just found out.

38
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,000
Release her now!

39
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,400
Let her go.

40
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,520
It's okay.

41
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,840
Dad will protect you.

42
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:56,730
Let's go.

43
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,450
Please wait.

44
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,280
Mr. Ye,

45
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,960
we still have one more thing to investigate.

46
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,180
Investigate what?

47
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:08,360
It's this.

48
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:09,880
This box.

49
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,520
We found it.

50
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,080
We believe it's hers.

51
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:15,760
And?

52
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,440
Inside this

53
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,320
there's a gun.

54
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,760
Is the gun yours?

55
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,760
It's not hers.

56
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,640
I know my daughter.

57
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:36,200
Can we leave now?

58
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:38,690
Alright.

59
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,240
Miss Ye,

60
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,520
your feet.

61
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,640
There are mountain paths all around us.

62
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,200
It's too dangerous like this.

63
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,400
Please sit.

64
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,480
Sit down.

65
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,080
Sit.

66
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:55,800
Look.

67
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,880
You can't go out like this.

68
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,360
You could easily get hurt.

69
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,520
May I borrow your foot.

70
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,440
Perfect fit.

71
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,440
Where did you get this gun?

72
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,280
Your profession?

73
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,440
I work as a dance companion in Shanghai.

74
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,400
Is that so?

75
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,560
That's a decent job these days.

76
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,200
You work at the Cathay Ballroom

77
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,680
on Avenue Edward VII as a dancing girl.

78
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,770
I've been to that ballroom.

79
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:05,860
Nice lighting.

80
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:11,000
Just that the marble dance floor is a bit slippery.

81
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,320
Isn't that right?

82
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,440
Methurst Road.

83
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,360
I didn't hear clearly.

84
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,000
What?

85
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,060
Say that again?

86
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,640
The Cathay Ballroom is on Methurst Road,

87
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,080
not where you mentioned.

88
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:38,960
And also,

89
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,440
it has a spring dance floor,

90
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,040
not marble.

91
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:48,880
Indeed.

92
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,800
I've been away from Shanghai for three or four years.

93
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,330
No wonder I mixed things up.

94
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,800
Back then,

95
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,400
we would leave from the Hongkou barracks,

96
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,680
take the No. 26 tram first,

97
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,080
arrive at North Sea Road,

98
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,600
then pass through Parker Lane to get to your ballroom.

99
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,280
At the entrance of Parker Lane,

100
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,680
there was also a Xieji snack shop.

101
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,840
Their food was really delicious.

102
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,960
Now tell me,

103
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,280
what's your mission?

104
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,480
Who sent you here?

105
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,720
Let her go! Let her go!

106
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,400
Whether my daughter is a dancer or not

107
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,440
is none of your business.

108
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,700
I'll handle it myself.

109
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,200
Let's go.

110
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,480
Mr. Ye,

111
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:30,640
do you think

112
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,200
your relationship with Commander Fujita

113
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,640
can protect her?

114
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,600
I will protect my daughter.

115
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,960
I don't rely on anyone.

116
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,720
Xia'er.

117
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,320
Xia'er.

118
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:58,760
Grandma,

119
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,680
something terrible has happened!

120
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,520
It's terrible!

121
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,960
Master was taken to the police station

122
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,620
and captured by the Japanese.

123
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:04,930
Let's go see.

124
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,140
What are you doing?

125
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,520
Listen up, everyone!

126
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,850
Search everything!

127
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,290
What do you want?

128
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,400
Ye Longxia.

129
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,159
Captain.

130
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,120
What do you want? I'm busy.

131
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,920
An officer has barged in.

132
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,480
Mr. Ye.

133
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,180
My name is Wumu Yilang.

134
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,040
Nice to meet you.

135
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,300
Please take care of me.

136
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,480
I've only been away from you for a few hours,

137
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,540
and you've made yourself such a mess.

138
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,200
Your buttons are all undone.

139
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:18,760
Who unbuttoned them?

140
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,120
Button up your shirt.

141
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,370
The one you unbuttoned.

142
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:41,960
Didn't she tell you

143
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,090
that she's my woman?

144
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:44,330
Speak up.

145
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,120
Wait a moment.

146
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:46,800
We found something in that woman's bag.

147
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,880
Shut your mouth.

148
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,440
May I ask who you are?

149
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,920
This is the special envoy from Tokyo,

150
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,450
Colonel Takeki Ichiro from the Emperor's Chamberlain Office.

151
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,080
[Salute]

152
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,420
[End of salute]

153
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,160
Captain Inoue, correct?

154
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,020
I've heard a lot about you.

155
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,760
Back in Shanghai,

156
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,040
your father, Mr. Inoue Akira, and I...

157
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,960
I had drinks with Miss Ye

158
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,720
at the Guotai Ballroom.

159
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:24,200
Miss Ye is my assistant.

160
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,440
She's under my protection.

161
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,120
That gun in your hand was given to her by me.

162
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Keep the gun safe.

163
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,900
When you're in danger,

164
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,610
you can shoot directly.

165
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:43,720
Colonel,

166
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,850
the commander is still waiting for us.

167
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,840
Can Miss Ye go home now?

168
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,760
Of course. This way, please.

169
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,170
This way, Mr. Ye.

170
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,040
Wait.

171
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:00,200
I'll take

172
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:00,880
this bag.

173
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,260
Captain Inoue.

174
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,600
Transportation on the island is inconvenient.

175
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,760
I need a car.

176
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:07,680
Yes, sir.

177
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,160
I'll arrange a car and driver for the Colonel right away.

178
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,680
Understood.

179
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,480
I won't need a driver.

180
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,880
Very well. No driver.

181
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,880
I apologize for the inconvenience.

182
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,370
Thank you. Goodbye.

183
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,280
Dad!

184
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:35,520
Dad!

185
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,720
I understand.

186
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,640
Who is he?

187
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,960
His name is Takemukiichiro.

188
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,160
A Japanese?

189
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,080
Biying,

190
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,080
put your luggage in my car first.

191
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,640
The other gun is with Luo Zhiyong.

192
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,170
I'll go see my father first.

193
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:09,840
Colonel,

194
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,480
Commander Fujita is still waiting for you.

195
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,440
Has Sasaki returned yet?

196
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:28,800
Yes.

197
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,320
No, not yet.

198
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,440
That's right.

199
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,040
He should still be in Tanjiawan Village

200
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,280
searching the hidden room.

201
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,400
Should we send someone to tell him to come back immediately?

202
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,440
Go ahead.

203
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:43,880
Come back.

204
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:49,240
Don't bother. Let him search.

205
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,560
If Sasaki doesn't find anyone

206
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,920
and this Colonel complains to the Commander

207
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,720
I'm afraid we'll be blamed from above.

208
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,280
What are you panicking about?

209
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,440
While this Colonel from headquarters

210
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,520
is meeting with Commander Fujita

211
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,560
we'll raid the Ye family's nest

212
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,000
and gain the upper hand.

213
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,160
This is our police unit's job.

214
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,440
What did you just say?

215
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:15,960
You dare to speak when you haven't caught anyone?

216
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:16,600
Let me tell you.

217
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,360
If we really don't catch anyone...

218
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,080
If we do find someone

219
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,800
let's see how this Colonel

220
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,640
and that Ye family woman of his

221
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,120
will continue to be so arrogant.

222
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,280
This is our police unit's job.

223
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,960
Search thoroughly

224
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,200
don't miss any spot.

225
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,600
Everyone ready!

226
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,760
Ready!

227
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,240
Your biggest threat

228
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:13,240
is this Lieutenant General Fujita.

229
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,400
He loves Japanese historical texts

230
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,160
and Chinese history as well.

231
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,490
He's an expert on China.

232
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,360
This man has served as

233
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,640
an assistant military attaché at the New York consulate

234
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,480
and is one of the few historians in the Japanese Navy.

235
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,720
He's very cunning.

236
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,320
If he sends a telegram to verify your identity,

237
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,680
then your cover will be blown

238
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,560
within 48 hours.

239
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,640
You should consider abandoning the mission

240
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:35,300
and getting out immediately.

241
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,440
Imperial Palace Investigation Officer

242
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,600
Takeshi Muki,

243
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,400
reporting to Commander Fujita.

244
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:02,600
I'm pleased to see you here.

245
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,000
Sakamoto.

246
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,560
I'm Adjutant Sakamoto.

247
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,200
We have received

248
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,280
notification from the Shanghai garrison

249
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,210
and have been waiting for you here.

250
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,180
Thank you for your hard work, Commander.

251
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,200
An envoy from the palace...

252
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,400
The purpose of this trip

253
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,200
must be extraordinary.

254
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:36,840
This way, please.

255
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,800
Even if you don't want to tell me, I can guess.

256
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,930
I suppose it's about Dajiao Censheng.

257
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:57,600
In recent years,

258
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,760
the only thing from here that could alarm the palace

259
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,040
is this matter.

260
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:02,160
Commander,

261
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,360
I trust that Adjutant Sakamoto

262
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,360
will certainly find me

263
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,960
a comfortable place to rest.

264
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:07,760
Indeed.

265
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:08,920
Sakamoto,

266
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,920
arrange accommodations for the special envoy immediately.

267
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,920
Have him stay at headquarters,

268
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,320
so we can communicate more easily.

269
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,200
Commander,

270
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,440
I'd prefer to stay at the airfield.

271
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,280
The airfield guards

272
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,840
and all the pilots are stationed there,

273
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,970
which would be convenient for my work.

274
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,120
I understand.

275
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,320
Have the airfield guards

276
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,640
prepare a nice quarters for the special envoy,

277
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:29,320
with all amenities up to my standards.

278
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,200
Yes, sir.

279
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,840
Let's go inside then.

280
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:48,680
[Salute]

281
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,440
This way, please.

282
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,200
Please have a seat, Colonel.

283
00:17:18,119 --> 00:17:20,200
Commander Fujita, I have one more thing to report.

284
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,839
The Colonel is one of us.

285
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:23,440
Go ahead.

286
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,640
Mr. Ye has a letter for you.

287
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:53,280
I heard you studied at Tongwen Academy.

288
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,720
So you must understand Chinese.

289
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,280
Yes, a little.

290
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:09,760
Sakamoto.

291
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:10,680
Yes.

292
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:13,280
Has the police unit taken any action recently?

293
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,440
They suspect

294
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,680
there might be another American

295
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,600
on the downed aircraft,

296
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,560
but they haven't found him yet.

297
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,960
The police unit has searched Tanjiawan Village

298
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,020
and all other villages on the island.

299
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,040
Colonel,

300
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,360
how do you think we should handle this?

301
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:36,960
Sir,

302
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:38,600
I've just arrived on the island.

303
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:39,880
Regarding the conflicts between

304
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,680
the islanders and our stationed troops,

305
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,080
I cannot make a judgment.

306
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:45,440
But speaking of Mr. Ye,

307
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,320
there's something else I need to report to you.

308
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:49,960
What is it?

309
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,440
Someone came to this island with me.

310
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,000
A Chinese woman.

311
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,480
Her name is Ye Biying.

312
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,880
She's Mr. Ye's daughter.

313
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,360
Young man, you have good taste.

314
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,000
That Mr. Ye

315
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,530
is a former consul who returned from America.

316
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,400
It's not like that.

317
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,680
Commander,

318
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,040
I thought

319
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,960
having someone familiar with the island

320
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,800
would facilitate my investigation.

321
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,600
So in Shanghai,

322
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,640
I asked them to find someone.

323
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,000
The Wang Jingwei government

324
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,560
sent Miss Ye to accompany me to the island.

325
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,680
Therefore,

326
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,480
I hope with her assistance,

327
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,880
my investigation will proceed more smoothly.

328
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,960
Good thinking.

329
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,880
They say General Taizumi's remains

330
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,000
were hidden by the local people.

331
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:32,960
During wartime,

332
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,520
certain actions by young people

333
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,160
are understandable.

334
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,320
Where is she?

335
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,680
As soon as she arrived on the island,

336
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,960
she was detained by the special police unit.

337
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,840
I just got her released.

338
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,800
Inoue, Kamakura and their kind

339
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,860
are more trouble than they're worth.

340
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,200
Always suspicious about everything.

341
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,200
Who knows what they're really up to.

342
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,200
I've already met Captain Inoue.

343
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:00,340
I'm afraid he now harbors resentment toward me.

344
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,000
Commander,

345
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,040
although I have already

346
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,440
sent Miss Ye and her father

347
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,400
home for their reunion,

348
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,440
however,

349
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,560
considering the current situation,

350
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,820
I'm still concerned about their safety.

351
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:16,160
These brutes!

352
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,560
I've repeatedly instructed Inoue and the others

353
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,490
not to take excessive actions against the Ye family.

354
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:23,720
Sakamoto.

355
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,280
Go to the Ye residence and invite Mr. Ye

356
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,960
to come to headquarters for dinner.

357
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,200
Just tell him I want to invite him to discuss history

358
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,200
and tea ceremony.

359
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,200
The old gentleman from the Ye family used to be a diplomat.

360
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,200
Be polite to him.

361
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,200
Isn't Translator Luo back?

362
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,330
Have him go with you.

363
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,580
I'll take my leave now.

364
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,520
My apologies for embarrassing you, Colonel.

365
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,680
I'm truly sorry.

366
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,800
I've just arrived here

367
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,530
and caused you so much trouble.

368
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,520
With your support and help,

369
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,600
I believe my investigation

370
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,530
will certainly proceed smoothly.

371
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,720
The shoe fell off.

372
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,120
How embarrassing.

373
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,480
It's indecent.

374
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,360
Captain,

375
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,380
I think there's something wrong with that wall.

376
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,680
That side is 40.

377
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,520
This side is 80.

378
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,320
Look.

379
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:18,920
Dad.

380
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,320
Dad.

381
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:26,560
Dad.

382
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:42,120
Your return is a big deal

383
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,720
and a happy occasion.

384
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,200
But you scared me, you know that?

385
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,520
What I saw was

386
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,440
a girl dressed provocatively

387
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:55,680
being intimate with a Japanese officer.

388
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,040
I can choose not to be angry

389
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,080
or scold you.

390
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,960
But think about if your mother were still here,

391
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,440
seeing you like this,

392
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,740
wouldn't she be heartbroken?

393
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,760
Please don't be like this.

394
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:16,560
Alright.

395
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,490
Please don't talk like that, okay?

396
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,770
Acting cute won't work.

397
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,080
I will definitely give you

398
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,610
a reasonable explanation.

399
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,730
Now you even know how to use diplomatic language.

400
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,760
You've grown up.

401
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,680
If a child is not taught properly, it's the father's fault.

402
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,080
I've disciplined you strictly

403
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,540
and taught you carefully.

404
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,640
But I never imagined,

405
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,500
never thought you would hit me with this bombshell.

406
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,600
In the end, it's still my fault.

407
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,400
Dad,

408
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,560
I'm sorry.

409
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:54,760
Dad.

410
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,480
Let me think about it.

411
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,540
You need to think about it too.

412
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,640
When you go inside,

413
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,530
I hope you can bring my daughter back to me.

414
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,960
Bring the tools over.

415
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,280
Here.

416
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,250
Make him behave.

417
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,600
Xia'er.

418
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,600
Xia'er.

419
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,620
What are you doing?

420
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,800
What are you doing?

421
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,280
Stop!

422
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:14,960
Stop it!

423
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,240
Let him go!

424
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:20,800
What's going on here?

425
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:25,840
Stop!

426
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,400
Yingying!

427
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:33,360
Auntie Si!

428
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:33,930
Ying'er!

429
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,520
Jingshang

430
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,080
has released you.

431
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:41,320
Yes.

432
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,280
I suggest you stop this immediately.

433
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,920
Major Takeki who came back with me

434
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,440
has already gone to see your Commander Fujita.

435
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,440
Stop talking.

436
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,080
Dad.

437
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,200
We have some family matters to deal with.

438
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,400
Please leave now.

439
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,680
I don't understand what you're talking about.

440
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:00,420
All I know is

441
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,840
I haven't received any orders to withdraw.

442
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,450
Break down the wall.

443
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,180
What are you doing?

444
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,360
You can't break the wall!

445
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:11,920
Stop!

446
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,680
Let me go!

447
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,200
Stop it!

448
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,120
Stop!

449
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:16,580
Father!

450
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,120
Stop it!

451
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,440
Sasaki!

452
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,720
Hello, Deputy Officer. What are you doing?

453
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,120
I'm just carrying out my orders.

454
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,440
Orders?

455
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,000
What a coincidence.

456
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,440
I've also received orders from Commander Fujita.

457
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,440
To come here.

458
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,840
My apologies for the intrusion.

459
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,160
Commander Fujita invites Mr. Ye

460
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:00,400
to headquarters for dinner

461
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:04,040
to enjoy tea and discuss history.

462
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,120
I'm terribly sorry,

463
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,280
the Commander invites you for dinner

464
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,040
at headquarters

465
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,300
to enjoy some tea and chat about history.

466
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,680
You've searched our home two days in a row

467
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,680
and turned everything upside down.

468
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,880
Don't listen to them.

469
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,740
They surely have bad intentions.

470
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,680
The Commander's orders

471
00:28:20,680 --> 00:28:22,640
were to search, weren't they?

472
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,450
Commander Fujita is sincerely inviting you.

473
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,700
The Commander says

474
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,920
you both served as diplomats in America

475
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,240
and surely must have

476
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,000
much in common.

477
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,960
Therefore, Commander Fujita asks that you please honor him with your presence.

478
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,680
The Commander sincerely invites you.

479
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,160
He says you both served as diplomats in America

480
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,480
and have much to talk about.

481
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,280
He hopes you'll certainly come.

482
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:50,420
Thank you for the Commander's sincere invitation.

483
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,560
But please inform the Commander

484
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:57,060
that my time as a consul belongs to the previous regime.

485
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,960
I no longer wish to recall

486
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,240
the past.

487
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,640
It's all history.

488
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,760
These are times of war,

489
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,050
and I don't wish to discuss it anymore.

490
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:11,320
As for Captain Sasaki

491
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,000
claiming there's a hidden room in my house,

492
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,320
he has already conducted a search once.

493
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:18,840
You come today

494
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,800
to smash my wall again.

495
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,440
Is this how you conduct an inquiry?

496
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,440
Commander Fujita is very upset

497
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:38,040
about the recent harassment of the Ye family by the police squad.

498
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,520
You need to go back and advise them

499
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,380
not to take such radical actions.

500
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,080
Also, the Ye family's daughter

501
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:51,360
seems to have close relations with the new Major on the island.

502
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,000
Even Commander Fujita

503
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,320
has to show respect to this Major.

504
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,520
I advise you

505
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:02,280
not to provoke her.

506
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,960
I'm terribly sorry.

507
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,120
Mr. Ye,

508
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,400
please consider it seriously.

509
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,260
We'd be honored by your presence.

510
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,360
Thank you for the Commander's invitation.

511
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,280
I still have some matters to attend to at home,

512
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,640
so perhaps next time.

513
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,920
The Ye family has some matters to attend to.

514
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,580
We'll schedule for next time.

515
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,040
What are you standing there for?

516
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:38,920
Fall back.

517
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,400
Then we'll take our leave now.

518
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,050
Ying'er.

519
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:32,560
Auntie Si.

520
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,120
Yingying.

521
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,320
You really came back.

522
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:53,960
Dad.

523
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,920
If you dare to come in,

524
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,280
I'll assume you've thought it through.

525
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,440
Young people inevitably make mistakes when they're away from home.

526
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,640
I can forgive you.

527
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,240
But

528
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,160
you cannot make the same mistake again.

529
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,660
The island is chaotic now.

530
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,490
You'd better stay home.

531
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,440
But...

532
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:32,760
Auntie Si,

533
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,400
take Ying'er back to her room

534
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,660
and help her settle in.

535
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:39,000
Yingying,

536
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:39,880
come along.

537
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,440
Auntie Si has missed you so much.

538
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,370
Ying'er, get some good rest today.

539
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:05,840
Didn't you have an appointment with Ju'er?

540
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,500
Are you going to get medicine?

541
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,360
Yes.

542
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:09,520
Go quickly.

543
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,000
Okay, Dad. I'm going.

544
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:21,160
During General Dajiao Censheng's stay in Guangzhou,

545
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,240
he received orders from military headquarters

546
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,320
appointing him as the commander

547
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:28,240
of the newly established Japanese South Pacific Fleet.

548
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:28,960
Do you know

549
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,880
how much power a Combined Fleet Commander has?

550
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,480
But right at this moment,

551
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,800
General Dajiao suddenly had an accident.

552
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:39,660
This will inevitably raise suspicions from His Majesty the Emperor.

553
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,360
Indeed.

554
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,360
I heard the South Pacific Fleet

555
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:47,480
is planning to establish its headquarters on Hainan Island.

556
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,680
For this purpose, Vice Admiral Sunakawa Kaneo

557
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,840
and Rear Admiral Yu Hengwaner

558
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,840
have already established the Hainan Defense Office.

559
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:55,960
They're just waiting for General Dajiao Censheng to take office.

560
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:56,840
What a pity.

561
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,760
You must also know

562
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,760
about the Southern Expansion Faction

563
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,080
and the Northern Expansion Faction.

564
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,320
In the Military Department, the Navy Ministry,

565
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:05,680
and even before the Emperor, they're causing quite a commotion.

566
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,400
General Dajiao Censheng has also been

567
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:11,330
the target of several assassination attempts because of this matter.

568
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,130
Was it done by someone from our organization?

569
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:27,040
There is another highly confidential matter

570
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:29,760
that I believe you should know about.

571
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,480
At the time of General Dajiao's incident,

572
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,760
he was carrying an important document.

573
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,080
It was an 'Imperial Conference Minutes.'

574
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,139
This 'Imperial Conference Minutes'

575
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,050
has only seven copies in total.

576
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:42,880
Only the Emperor,

577
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:43,880
the Prime Minister,

578
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,880
and the Army and Navy leaders possess them.

579
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,600
But at the scene of the incident,

580
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,600
this document disappeared as well.

581
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:51,639
Is that so?

582
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:54,440
There was such a confidential document involved?

583
00:34:54,679 --> 00:34:55,340
Therefore,

584
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,200
the orders I've received this time

585
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,880
are to thoroughly investigate

586
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,540
the truth behind General Dajiao's plane crash.

587
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,800
Also, we must recover this document.

588
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,880
I understand.

589
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,800
Our base will fully cooperate

590
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,240
with the special envoy's investigation.

591
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,440
Please rest assured.

592
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,440
Yes.

593
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,200
Your military attaché is Hasunuma Ban, right?

594
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,560
I know him.

595
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,000
The Army Ministry and Navy Ministry

596
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,760
have been quarreling for many years.

597
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:42,680
One wants to advance north,

598
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,210
the other wants to go south.

599
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,080
Now the debate is over.

600
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,560
His Majesty adopted the southern faction's proposal.

601
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,640
They thoroughly bombed Pearl Harbor,

602
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,680
captured Hong Kong on the same day,

603
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,040
and launched a full-scale offensive

604
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,640
across the entire Pacific and Southeast Asia.

605
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,560
You're close to His Majesty,

606
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,960
and often move between the Naval Ministry, Naval Command,

607
00:35:58,960 --> 00:35:59,620
Naval Base,

608
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,010
and the Army General Staff, don't you?

609
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,780
I'd like to hear your opinion.

610
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,040
Commander,

611
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,840
do you want to hear the official view from newspapers and documents,

612
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,960
or my personal opinion?

613
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,760
Of course, I want your private opinion between us.

614
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:25,280
It will increase significantly.

615
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:30,200
Do you think there's also an issue with Colonel Takeki?

616
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,840
I don't know if there's something wrong with him.

617
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:33,840
I just remembered

618
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,040
my mindset when playing cards.

619
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,520
What mindset?

620
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:45,040
When I have a bad hand,

621
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,640
I bluff

622
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:53,120
and act arrogantly,

623
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,320
trying to completely fool my opponent.

624
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,000
Are you saying

625
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,160
Major Wumu's credentials are questionable?

626
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,280
All I know is

627
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:05,240
if this person has a good hand.

628
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,720
What cards are you talking about?

629
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,480
He would definitely give his opponents

630
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,480
the impression that he's unlucky,

631
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,040
and he would often hide

632
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,560
his true feelings and confidence.

633
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,760
Should we investigate Major Wumu?

634
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,840
How?

635
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,360
We can't exactly

636
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:30,360
send a telegram to His Majesty the Emperor and the Prime Minister

637
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,880
to verify their investigator's identity.

638
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:34,720
So there's nothing we can do about him?

639
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:36,320
Even if we

640
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,920
can't send messages to the Emperor and Prime Minister,

641
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,120
we can start investigating that woman.

642
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,520
Investigate the woman?

643
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:44,120
Yes.

644
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,760
The Pearl River estuary has spring-like weather all year round.

645
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,440
It's truly a wonderful place.

646
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:54,320
The base has fresh fruit available throughout the year.

647
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,000
Please enjoy.

648
00:37:59,000 --> 00:37:59,720
Thank you.

649
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,250
It's really delicious.

650
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,130
Commander, sir.

651
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,680
In my opinion,

652
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,440
the American naval power

653
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,280
is superior to our own.

654
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:18,560
Although we

655
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,000
launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor

656
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,480
and essentially destroyed

657
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,720
the American Pacific Fleet,

658
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,840
this has made the Southern Expansion officers

659
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,880
somewhat overconfident,

660
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:28,480
believing that American naval power isn't all that impressive.

661
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,520
Many naval commanders don't share this view.

662
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,160
America has officially declared war on us.

663
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:35,280
Our Kwantung Army

664
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,800
has 14 divisions

665
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,640
with over 1.3 million men,

666
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,640
yet they dare not withdraw a single division

667
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,680
to join the southern campaign.

668
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,560
We can only continue drafting soldiers from home.

669
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,720
Just before I came,

670
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,360
a new conscription order was issued,

671
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,880
raising the age limit

672
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,440
to 55 years old.

673
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,560
Yes,

674
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,400
this matter is enough to worry His Majesty.

675
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,120
Our entire domestic defense now

676
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,760
consists of only three divisions.

677
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,280
The rest are just ineffective reserves.

678
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,920
If there's any unexpected situation

679
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:06,920
I think we'll be in serious trouble.

680
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,440
As expected from someone close to His Majesty,

681
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,570
your perspective is truly different.

682
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:17,680
We attacked Pearl Harbor

683
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,880
and completely infuriated America.

684
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,720
They have a massive

685
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:24,640
naval, land and air combat force.

686
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:26,160
America's military industrial capacity

687
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,960
far exceeds our own.

688
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:29,840
Just imagine two years from now.

689
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:32,240
Our army's artillery and navy's vessels

690
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,560
are constantly being lost in battle and cannot be replaced.

691
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,880
But America's military factories

692
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,280
are working at full capacity

693
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,840
producing new artillery, new vessels

694
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,680
and creating new problems for us.

695
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,680
By that time,

696
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,560
I truly cannot imagine

697
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,560
what kind of situation we will face.

698
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,920
The Naval General Staff has done something

699
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,200
that has pleased Roosevelt, Churchill

700
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:51,800
and Chiang Kai-shek of China

701
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,800
very much.

702
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:54,960
Last month I met with

703
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,490
Admiral Yamamoto Isoroku.

704
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,400
His concerns are the same as yours.

705
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,600
As expected of a General Staff officer,

706
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:01,760
you have such a broad perspective,

707
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,890
truly exceptional.

708
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:05,160
Only by quickly completing

709
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,600
operations in the entire China theater

710
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,120
and transferring all the main forces here

711
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:09,380
to the Pacific theater

712
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:11,240
can we ensure that in two years

713
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,040
Japan's homeland remains safe.

714
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,280
Excuse me, sir.

715
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,720
As you instructed,

716
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,400
I went to invite Mr. Ye De,

717
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,260
but he refused.

718
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:30,000
Also, the special police unit has withdrawn.

719
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,640
I understand.

720
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:32,880
You may go.

721
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:33,570
Yes, sir.

722
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,660
I'll take my leave.

723
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,690
You must be Translator Luo.

724
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,480
My female assistant

725
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,940
You still have something that belongs to me.

726
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,000
So you're Colonel Wumu.

727
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,280
I've been wanting to return this to you in person,

728
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,480
but I forgot about it.

729
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,440
Thank you for keeping it for her.

730
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,840
If Major Wumu hadn't mentioned it,

731
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,400
you probably wouldn't have returned it voluntarily.

732
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,060
Commander,

733
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,380
I would never dare.

734
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,560
Bring this over here.

735
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,480
A gentleman is open and forthright,

736
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,480
while a petty man is always fearful.

737
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,200
Kill exactly 50 flies,

738
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:21,880
arrange them neatly.

739
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:24,080
After I finish talking with the Major,

740
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:25,320
I'll come inspect them personally.

741
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:25,850
Yes, sir.

742
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:26,700
Get out!

743
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,650
He's the one who infiltrated our army.

744
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:39,920
A fly.

745
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,320
Sakamoto,

746
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,720
I have one more favor to ask you.

747
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:45,640
Could you go to my car

748
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,120
and get a green cloth bag?

749
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,160
Yes, sir.

750
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:48,760
Thank you.

751
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:59,000
That woman was born on this island,

752
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,880
so

753
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,880
someone must know about her situation.

754
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,800
If you put it that way,

755
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:13,210
there's a nurse at our military hospital,

756
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,280
Tang Ju'er,

757
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,400
who's about the same age as Ye Biying.

758
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,880
Should know something about it.

759
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,480
