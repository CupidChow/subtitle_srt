1
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,320
I've never even seen any royal guards.

2
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,479
and officers by the Emperor's side.

3
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:41,039
Watch your mouth.

4
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,039
Our people are always by your side.

5
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,920
Understand?

6
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,560
Yes.

7
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,200
Sir.

8
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,720
They have left.

9
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,280
Japanese Shanghai Intelligence Office

10
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,240
and the Sambu Island Police Brigade.

11
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,480
I tried my best to find this.

12
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,240
The anti-spy expert is coming.

13
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,720
There must be something wrong

14
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,880
with Takemichi.

15
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,000
Time was too short.

16
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,000
This is the only way

17
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:45,640
This is the only way.

18
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,160
I don't know

19
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,400
can really stop this.

20
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,200
the investigator of Tokyo Police Agency?

21
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,079
Sir.

22
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,800
What are you worried about?

23
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:01,840
I'm worried.

24
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,320
After the Japanese army, Shanghai Intelligence Department

25
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,160
will also threaten him

26
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,240
after receiving this special envoy.

27
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:11,880
He might not compromise in the end.

28
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,960
We have to be prepared for the worst.

29
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,600
Don't worry too much.

30
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,840
Even if they threaten the envoy,

31
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,600
this envoy

32
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,040
won't be so stupid

33
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,280
to get involved in the palace fight.

34
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:28,840
Besides,

35
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,760
we have something on him.

36
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,600
He should be restrained.

37
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,480
That's all

38
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,920
is this.

39
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,360
Since this envoy's real mission

40
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,760
to investigate Takemichi,

41
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,600
Then they must

42
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,000
fabricate his identity and hide it from Takemici.

43
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,000
Hurry up.

44
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,160
to the commander.

45
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,320
Tell them to do whatever they can.

46
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,560
Tell Takemici.

47
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:57,920
Yes.

48
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:14,680
Take a look

49
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,480
Come again if you use it well.

50
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:17,600
Army 68281.

51
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:17,920
Army 68281.

52
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,279
Cigarettes for sale.

53
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,000
Excuse me

54
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,560
Come and see

55
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,400
Hello. Hello.

56
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:08,560
Who are you?

57
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,160
Hello.

58
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,960
Are you Mr. Yabijiro?

59
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,600
Yes.

60
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,480
Major General Tangchuan sent me to pick you up.

61
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,960
Thank you.

62
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:08,680
Ju.

63
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,240
You're so beautiful today.

64
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:16,920
Does that still hurt?

65
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,160
Where's your arm?

66
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,080
Does your arm still hurt?

67
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,160
I feel so sorry for you today.

68
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,360
It's okay.

69
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,080
It's all in the past.

70
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,560
Let's be good.

71
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,360
You're so beautiful today.

72
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,320
What are you doing?

73
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:32,680
Where are you going?

74
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,159
Nothing.

75
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,120
I'm going out.

76
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,040
I'll be back soon.

77
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,320
Attention!

78
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,760
Salute.

79
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:01,960
Sakamoto.

80
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,640
Have you arranged everything

81
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,360
on the island tomorrow?

82
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:07,400
Yes.

83
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,560
Everything is ready.

84
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,480
Got it.

85
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:26,880
Sakamoto.

86
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,480
Yes.

87
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,480
Go back and rest.

88
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,360
Okay.

89
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:31,800
Excuse me.

90
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,960
What are you doing here?

91
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,640
Nothing.

92
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,800
I'm here to deliver the translation documents.

93
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:44,880
Why didn't you turn on the lights?

94
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,240
I was going to put it down and leave.

95
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,640
but you're back.

96
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,160
Bring me the report from two days ago.

97
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:41,880
Well...

98
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:44,160
Were you trying to say something?

99
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:48,960
Commander.

100
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,360
Get some rest.

101
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:54,080
Turn that off.

102
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,720
Welcome to Shanghai, investigator.

103
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:38,600
Hope you have a pleasant trip to Shanghai.

104
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,320
I didn't expect Tian Rong and the deputy officers

105
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,120
are so efficient.

106
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,200
Our Shanghai Army Headquarters

107
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:51,480
and Inashimi Apartment just sent a telegram.

108
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,000
they sent you

109
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,360
to me.

110
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,720
It's an honor.

111
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:01,200
Here.

112
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,520
My Lord.

113
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,040
Try Shanghai Flavor.

114
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:16,880
What?

115
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,760
The investigator looks upset.

116
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,360
Do you not like the food?

117
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,240
No.

118
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,240
The food is delicious.

119
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,200
Thank you.

120
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:30,080
Let's drink.

121
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,760
Did something happen

122
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,840
on my way here?

123
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,320
My Lord.

124
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,400
Please remember

125
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,280
you have never seen us.

126
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,240
or even the Royal Guards.

127
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,400
and officers around the Emperor.

128
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,040
Watch your mouth.

129
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,920
Our people

130
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,840
are always by your side.

131
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,240
Understand?

132
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,320
You two worry too much.

133
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,480
I'm just tired

134
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,720
and feel uncomfortable.

135
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,080
Our army in Shanghai

136
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,480
and the Special Forces Brigade of Airlines 6.

137
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,040
The reason I asked the investigator to come here

138
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,280
I believe you already know

139
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,200
I believe you already know.

140
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,880
We need you, My Lord.

141
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,600
to the 6th Airport base

142
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,040
to conduct a special investigation.

143
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,160
There is a letter

144
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,960
with a letter for the palace.

145
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,240
A special colonel.

146
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,120
He has many doubts

147
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,640
in Airport 6.

148
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,720
I understand.

149
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:44,840
Of course.

150
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,480
The real mission of Lord Investigator

151
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,000
is to investigate that officer.

152
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,480
To hide the truth,

153
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:50,080
we need to

154
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:51,240
a fake identity.

155
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,720
What identity?

156
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:55,600
We plan to let the investigator

157
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:59,880
to visit the island

158
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,320
to visit the island.

159
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,720
The Ministry of Taxation

160
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,640
To realize

161
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,200
our plan

162
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,160
must change the nation structure of Asia.

163
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,560
and the Japanese

164
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:16,520
the population advantage here

165
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,480
needs the Ministry of Taxation

166
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,400
from China.

167
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,200
Then we can take the initiative

168
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,120
and occupy the whole China.

169
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,560
is just around the corner.

170
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,040
The royal army has occupied Sanbu Island

171
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,920
It's been over four years.

172
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,280
Some of them

173
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,120
from China.

174
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,400
I plan to

175
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,600
to immigrate from Okinawa.

176
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:03,480
The investigator secretly investigated

177
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,280
in secret.

178
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,160
I understand.

179
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,920
We'll wait and see

180
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:10,720
We'll wait and see.

181
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,360
I hope we can find out

182
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:15,400
to figure out

183
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,520
behind this Colonel.

184
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,880
When it's done,

185
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,840
there will be a lot of benefits.

186
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,600
And it's a good time for you to make contributions.

187
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,840
When I get on the island,

188
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:27,760
I'll do my best.

189
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,320
This special task

190
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,200
We can only stay on the island for a few days.

191
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,520
This colonel has a special identity.

192
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,800
and has a letter from the palace.

193
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,400
If we can't find anything suspicious,

194
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,040
please understand.

195
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,720
My Lord.

196
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,240
Before you do anything,

197
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,880
don't just think about leaving a way out.

198
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,080
Only when you do your best

199
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,400
there's a way out.

200
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,760
Otherwise, there will be no way out.

201
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,920
you'll die.

202
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,920
What do you think?

203
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:08,360
Yes.

204
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,880
Mr. Yabi.

205
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,480
Let's have a drink.

206
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:18,200
I hope you don't worry.

207
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,640
and do whatever you want.

208
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,520
A high-ranking official

209
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,400
is not

210
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,960
to you.

211
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,400
I think...

212
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:27,480
the title of spy nemesis

213
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,480
It can't be a false name.

214
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,360
What about me?

215
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,000
I have some family history

216
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,000
with Tian Rong and Second Minister.

217
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:45,400
It's a great honor

218
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,080
this time.

219
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,840
I have some respect for him.

220
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,480
I will communicate with him

221
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:56,480
on the island.

222
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,760
If there's any problem,

223
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,520
please let me know at any time.

224
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:09,320
I believe that Lord Investigator

225
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,920
won't let us down.

226
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,760
Am I right?

227
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,080
After all, the garrison in Shanghai

228
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:24,400
and our IShang Apartment

229
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,280
are not easy to deal with.

230
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,480
After dinner,

231
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,640
Have a good rest.

232
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,960
We will

233
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,160
as soon as possible.

234
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,480
Come and eat.

235
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,560
Make yourself at home.

236
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:00,360
Okay.

237
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,480
Please.

238
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,480
You're finally back.

239
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:38,280
Where did you go?

240
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,800
What took you so long?

241
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,800
I went to Fujita Command Center

242
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,000
and got the plan to lift the sea ban.

243
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,160
Watch the window.

244
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,280
If you find a car following us,

245
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,280
I'll block them here.

246
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,320
You go through the back window.

247
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,320
What's wrong?

248
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,480
What happened?

249
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,400
Something happened.

250
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:02,920
When I got the plan,

251
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,520
when I got the plan.

252
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,880
Interpreter Luo Zhiyong.

253
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:09,400
Well,

254
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,520
will he report you to Fujita?

255
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,760
If that's the case,

256
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,600
there will only be two situations.

257
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,000
What is it?

258
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,120
First,

259
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,800
at the airport gate.

260
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,040
It'll appear soon.

261
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,480
A car from the Command Unit.

262
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,920
or a car from the Special Forces Brigade on the island.

263
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,280
They're here to catch me.

264
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:32,920
What about the other situation?

265
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,200
The phone on the table will ring right away.

266
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,840
It's Fujita.

267
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,000
He will

268
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,240
in a way

269
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:40,720
He asked me to go somewhere.

270
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,040
That is to lure me.

271
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:43,360
Then...

272
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,640
If this happens,

273
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,960
you have to find a way to spread the information.

274
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,480
Once they catch me,

275
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,760
they will send a team to catch you.

276
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,040
Don't go home.

277
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,960
Find your fourth aunt.

278
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:00,200
She's the most insignificant.

279
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:01,960
Let her find a way

280
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,600
to help you smuggle to Zone 8.

281
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,120
It's quite safe there.

282
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,480
What are you doing

283
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,000
What are you doing?

284
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,600
Leave now.

285
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,640
We have to face different choices

286
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,200
we have to face different choices every day.

287
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,480
But the result we choose

288
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,360
is life or death.

289
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:22,560
Good.

290
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,480
I'm used to it.

291
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,000
How can I get used to it?

292
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,520
You'll be in danger.

293
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,480
Hurry up.

294
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,480
I can't leave now.

295
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:30,600
I have to

296
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,000
into a negative immediately.

297
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,520
Anlan Clinic doesn't know

298
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,600
our way of doing things.

299
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,280
If they open the film

300
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,480
open the film,

301
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,160
everything will be exposed.

302
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:39,880
Everything we did

303
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,800
is in vain.

304
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:42,640
So the safest thing

305
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,560
is to wash the film into a negative.

306
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,320
Understand?

307
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,720
It might not be that bad.

308
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,880
Fujita was at the command center just now.

309
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,680
Na Zhiyong didn't report me.

310
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,720
Otherwise, you wouldn't be able to see me now.

311
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,120
At least we're safe now.

312
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,360
What are you looking for?

313
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,400
I'm looking for...

314
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,160
What are you looking for?

315
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,720
The film is a sensitive material.

316
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,400
The main ingredient is braised silver.

317
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:50,680
Braised silver.

318
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,720
is sensitive to natural light.

319
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,120
Only the red light

320
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,120
to red light.

321
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:02,640
I don't know what you're looking for.

322
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,680
So I need

323
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,040
I need the red light in the room

324
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:05,880
to continue my work.

325
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,680
Understand?

326
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:07,960
The red light.

327
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,040
I need a red cloth

328
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,320
Cover the light.

329
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,640
Make the room a red light

330
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:18,960
Red cloth

331
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:21,680
It's red! It's red! It's red! It's red! It's red! It's red!

332
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,920
Red cloth.

333
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,400
Pajamas will do too.

334
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,320
Got it.

335
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,320
So what is the plan

336
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,680
What is it?

337
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,480
Kill all those who go out to sea.

338
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,800
What did you say?

339
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,040
So what we can do now

340
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,680
is to spread the film as soon as possible.

341
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,400
The more people know about this plan,

342
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,480
the more likely they can stop Oshima Ho's plot.

343
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,000
and save the people who set sail.

344
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,520
At the same time,

345
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,640
we have to tell everyone

346
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,520
their plan.

347
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,240
But my only worry now

348
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:40,760
is that time is running out.

349
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,040
I'll send it to my dad.

350
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,920
and let him spread the news with a pigeon.

351
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,760
Not now.

352
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:47,960
It's too tight outside.

353
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,600
If we go out now,

354
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,480
they will be more suspicious.

355
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,200
I have written

356
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,680
on the note.

357
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,200
What we need to do now

358
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,400
is to get back to normal.

359
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,040
Tomorrow morning,

360
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,840
take this note

361
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,040
and film

362
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:03,600
to your father.

363
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:05,320
Tell him to send the pigeon to Macao

364
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,680
to Macau with a pigeon.

365
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,480
What will happen

366
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,280
what will happen?

367
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,960
Can we meet again?

368
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,080
After they arrest us,

369
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,120
they will lock us up separately.

370
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:56,920
He won't give us

371
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,120
to talk.

372
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,200
So tonight

373
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,080
the last night

374
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,160
last night.

375
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,920
I'm Akino.

376
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,200
What is it?

377
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,920
Colonel went out tonight.

378
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:38,520
He hid in his room as soon as he came back.

379
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,120
Where is Colonel?

380
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:40,880
I don't know.

381
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,000
I don't know where he went.

382
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,160
He didn't take us there.

383
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,240
Is there anything suspicious today?

384
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,640
No.

385
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,240
Go to bed early.

386
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,160
Okay.

387
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,240
Bye.

388
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,480
The phone on the table will ring soon.

389
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,920
It's Fujita.

390
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,080
He will

391
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,600
in a way

392
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,120
He asked me to go somewhere.

393
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,320
That's to lure me.

394
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,480
Hello?

395
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,800
Okay, I got it.

396
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,400
Who's calling?

397
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:58,800
Did something happen?

398
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,320
Sakamoto speaking.

399
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:09,920
I'll pick you up.

400
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:18,560
Colonel.

401
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:22,760
Don't go.

402
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:23,920
Don't go. Don't go.

403
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:24,880
Coming.

404
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,199
When you get home,

405
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,800
tell your dad to send the information.

406
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:42,960
I'll be right back.

407
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:44,600
Wait for me.

408
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,240
Morning.

409
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,160
Let’s go.

410
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,720
Colonel, this way please.

411
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:47,840
This way, please.

412
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,000
General.

413
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,720
Commander.

414
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,960

Lieutenant General Sakawa Kenyu.

417
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,200
What are you doing at Airlines 6?

418
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,480
The war is getting tense.

419
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:12,880
He was entrusted by the Southern Army.

420
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,120
The troops here

421
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,560
will be transferred to the Southeast Asia battlefield.

422
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,200
Are we going to cancel this place too?

423
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,480
Not really.

424
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,480
He also heard that

425
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,160
You were ordered to

426
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,640
to investigate the fall of Major Major.

427
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,480
He wants to talk to you alone.

428
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:35,840
Yes.

429
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,200
The food in the hotel is not bad.

430
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,600
Yes.

431
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,680
My Lord.

432
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,480
How was your rest last night?

433
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,600
Last night,

434
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,480
the investigator was in a very low mood.

435
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:54,200
Is he sick?

436
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:55,880
Thank you for your concern.

437
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,200
I'm fine.

438
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,480
I think he's not used to the new place.

439
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,480
Yes.

440
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:05,640
Send the investigator to the dock later.

441
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:10,400
Someone will pick you up on the island.

442
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:13,600
When you leave,

443
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,720

447
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,920
It'll take about two days.

448
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,560
Thank you, sir.

449
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,960
You must be tired.

450
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:25,200
You're welcome.

451
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,280
Thank you for your concern.

452
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:27,960
I hope you will

453
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:33,000
remember what we told you last night.

454
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:36,520
Don't let us down.

455
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,560
I will do my best.

456
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:41,920
In that case,

457
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,720
let's go.

458
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,200

460
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,480
but it's as beautiful

461
00:38:58,640 --> 00:38:59,840
It's beautiful.

Let's take this opportunity

463
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,960

Colonel.

484
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,160

485
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:46,840

486
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:48,080
Did I make a mistake?

487
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:48,840
I'm fine.

488
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:50,640

489
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:51,680

490
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:53,200

496
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,720
