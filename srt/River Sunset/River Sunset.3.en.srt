1
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,800
Use up all these bullets.

2
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:38,600
Don't waste them.

3
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:39,200
Done.

4
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,600
Did you hit anything?

5
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:53,759
Continue.

6
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,000
[Report]

7
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,360
All missed.

8
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,640
Come here.

9
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,120
Over here.

10
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,360
Missed.

11
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,320
Here.

12
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:19,640
Missed.

13
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,520
Come here.

14
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,640
You hit the bullseye.

15
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,640
Continue.

16
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,560
It's so close.

17
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,400
Bullseye.

18
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,100
One shot, one kill.

19
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,640
This is your optimal shooting distance.

20
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:36,560
Remember this.

21
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,360
On the battlefield, at any time,

22
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,680
if you're not confident,

23
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,880
maintain this stance

24
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,730
and get closer to the enemy.

25
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,440
Xiao Ye.

26
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,260
This is all I can teach you.

27
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,160
Nothing more.

28
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:55,760
Thank you.

29
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,040
Keep this gun.

30
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,140
You're giving it to me?

31
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:00,880
Thanks.

32
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,880
Let's go.

33
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,170
Comrade Xiao Ye.

34
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,840
Let me introduce you.

35
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,880
This is Director Shen

36
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:26,320
from the Nationalist Government's Military Statistics Bureau.

37
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,120
Good day, sir.

38
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,520
Comrade Xiao Ye, no need for formalities.

39
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:33,160
Minister Li has been praising you.

40
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,960
He thinks very highly of you.

41
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:36,120
Minister Li,

42
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,760
can I take her back now?

43
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,560
Fine.

44
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,460
Director Shen.

45
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,090
I only emphasize one thing.

46
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,720
She must be returned safely.

47
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,240
Rest assured.

48
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,730
I'll take Comrade Xiao Ye back now.

49
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,960
Goodbye, Director Li.

50
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,720
Director Shen,

51
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,600
where are we going now?

52
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,290
To the Military Statistics Bureau compound in Zaozi Lanya.

53
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,800
Miss Ye,

54
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,460
there's no need to be nervous.

55
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,800
This mission is minor

56
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,840
and simple.

57
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,280
You haven't been back to your hometown for many years, right?

58
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,440
It's been many years.

59
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,800
Just treat it as a family visit.

60
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,360
Hurry up.

61
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,800
Miss Ye,

62
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,320
Wang will take you back to the office first.

63
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,640
I'll be there shortly.

64
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,000
Do I need to do the same as them?

65
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,920
I'll tell you later.

66
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,170
You don't need to wear that for now.

67
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,600
Mind your movements.

68
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,490
Everyone remember the key movements.

69
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,320
Director,

70
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:49,840
we've brought the person back.

71
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:50,960
Everything went smoothly.

72
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,280
What do you think?

73
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,040
He's definitely an amateur.

74
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,020
Would you like to meet him?

75
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:58,640
No need.

76
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,040
You handle it.

77
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,250
How are you, Miss Ye?

78
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,650
Are you adjusting well?

79
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,720
To complete the mission,

80
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,600
we've

81
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:19,580
created a cover identity for you.

82
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:20,840
From now on,

83
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,800
you're a surgeon at

84
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,460
Ruihua Hospital in Shanghai.

85
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,040
The hospital details,

86
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,880
your relationships with colleagues,

87
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,160
and all aspects of your life in Shanghai

88
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,520
are all documented here.

89
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,450
Memorize them as soon as possible.

90
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,880
What I'm about to say is particularly important.

91
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,360
Through your work,

92
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,920
you've become acquainted with Mr. Tang Shengming.

93
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,360
He's a senior advisor to the Wang regime

94
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,320
with considerable power in Shanghai.

95
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,880
He was once your patient.

96
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:47,960
On March 12,

97
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,720
you met a gentleman in Shanghai

98
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:52,640
named Mr. Wu, who wears Western suits.

99
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,659
Mr. Tang, through his daily interactions with you,

100
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,720
knows that you're from Zhongshan County,

101
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,240
in Sanzao Island, Guangdong.

102
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,880
His friend, Mr. Wu,

103
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,840
happens to be going to the island on business

104
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,920
and needs to find

105
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,920
a local who knows the island well.

106
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,520
So Mr. Tang arranged

107
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,680
for you two to meet.

108
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,120
This Mr. Wu,

109
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,120
whose full name is Takemukiichiro,

110
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,400
is a high-ranking Japanese military officer.

111
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,400
How could I possibly know a Japanese person

112
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,000
and become friends with him?

113
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,040
Miss Ye.

114
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,000
Please review these documents as quickly as possible.

115
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,560
You cannot leave this room

116
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,120
or take any materials with you.

117
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,840
There are our

118
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,960
security guards at the door for your protection.

119
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,080
If you need anything, you can ask them.

120
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,520
In half an hour,

121
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:33,320
we have several basic training exercises.

122
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,380
Change into this uniform.

123
00:07:36,159 --> 00:07:37,360
Do you like painters?

124
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,120
No.

125
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,320
The second one, Lieutenant.

126
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,250
Lieutenant.

127
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,760
The third one is also a Lieutenant.

128
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,520
Lieutenant.

129
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,040
The second one

130
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,440
is a naval officer's formal cap.

131
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,080
Naval rear admiral epaulettes.

132
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,280
Naval major epaulettes.

133
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,159
This one.

134
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,400
Miss Ye,

135
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,880
next

136
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,320
we're going to give you

137
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,720
basic training in surveillance and counter-surveillance.

138
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,040
Following someone.

139
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:08,800
Remember

140
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,860
all of the target's features.

141
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,560
Even in

142
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,520
crowded places,

143
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,960
don't lose them.

144
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,860
Follow this woman.

145
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,400
The one in the qipao.

146
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,060
Follow her.

147
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,000
Excuse me.

148
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,159
This is the positive terminal.

149
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,760
This is the negative terminal.

150
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,840
After you connect it,

151
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,900
just press it down.

152
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:39,419
Try connecting it.

153
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:40,820
Good. Connect it here.

154
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,520
When you press it,

155
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,770
don't be afraid.

156
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,080
This is a training round,

157
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,210
it's not dangerous.

158
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,260
Good. Now give it a try.

159
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,600
Mother,

160
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,360
I'm leaving.

161
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,000
Director Shen

162
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,000
asked me to bring these materials

163
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
for you to review.

164
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,160
However,

165
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:10,960
you can only read them here.

166
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,490
They can't leave this room.

167
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:18,080
The Director instructed that you'll depart after breakfast today.

168
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,040
You'll travel with him,

169
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,840
flying first to Changde Feng County Airport,

170
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,800
then taking a river boat from there to Shanghai.

171
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,650
Miss Ye, it's like this.

172
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,280
Everyone who trains here

173
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,010
must go through a political screening interview

174
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,040
and fill out some forms.

175
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,040
Fill out some forms?

176
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,800
It's just a formality.

177
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:47,840
Just give them to me when you're done.

178
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,680
Name, place of origin, social connections,

179
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,040
and even an oath?

180
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,320
You can just copy it as written.

181
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,040
This oath

182
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,200
is just to make a deeper impression on trainees

183
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:07,490
and to constantly remind those who sign it

184
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,480
not to forget their mission.

185
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,480
I keep my oath.

186
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,000
I was never summoned.

187
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,160
No angel notified me.

188
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:37,240
With my roses, I swear again.

189
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,840
By every sacred bee.

190
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:43,040
By the daisies called from the hillside.

191
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,140
Who told you to improvise?

192
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,360
I know.

193
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,560
After I fill out the form,

194
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,960
and attach my photo,

195
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,040
I'll become one of yours?

196
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,320
I'm a doctor in the Eighth Route Army.

197
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,320
I won't be fooled.

198
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,880
Miss Ye.

199
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,100
We're not asking you to join the Kuomintang.

200
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,400
If you fill out this form,

201
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,200
we can

202
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:09,260
assign you a specific military rank.

203
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,400
If you fall into Japanese hands,

204
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:15,200
having a rank would be better than not having one.

205
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,400
The Japanese in Nanjing

206
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,260
killed so many Chinese soldiers.

207
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,800
Didn't those people have military ranks?

208
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,370
This woman is stubborn.

209
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,760
She refused to fill out this form

210
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,820
and wrote these things on it instead.

211
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:46,240
During the KMT-CCP cooperation, each side takes what they need.

212
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,120
Let it be.

213
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,160
Miss Ye.

214
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,280
It's windy outside.

215
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:47,940
Put this on.

216
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,320
Thank you.

217
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,490
Are you seasick?

218
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,970
I feel a bit uncomfortable.

219
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,280
Look at the horizon

220
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,440
and not at the water.

221
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,240
I have a gift for you.

222
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,400
This is a Browning pocket pistol, M1906 model.

223
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,000
It's compatible with the one you were issued

224
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,080
and uses the same type of ammunition.

225
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,160
Many of our female field agents

226
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,560
like to carry one of these.

227
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,320
They keep it

228
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,450
in their stockings on the inner thigh.

229
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,340
It's more concealed that way.

230
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,040
I hope that in a critical moment,

231
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,770
it might save your life.

232
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:30,720
Thank you.

233
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,080
Takemura Ichiro knew

234
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:40,280
that from the moment he was awakened,

235
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:43,240
he might be saying goodbye to his mother forever.

236
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:44,080
He knew

237
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,760
whether he could return alive or not,

238
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:50,400
his profession didn't allow him to be indecisive

239
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,040
or sentimental.

240
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,360
Now

241
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,520
there were things more important than family

242
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,880
waiting for him to do.

243
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,680
He had laid low for nearly 10 years,

244
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,520
quietly staying by his mother's side to fulfill his filial duty,

245
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,079
all for today.

246
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,560
It was time for him to serve his country.

247
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,640
Excuse me.

248
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,240
May I sit here?

249
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:14,050
Please, have a seat.

250
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,920
Are you an officer too?

251
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,490
Which unit are you from?

252
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:22,839
Colonel, sir.

253
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:24,280
Here's today's newspaper.

254
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,280
Would you like it?

255
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,359
Thank you.

256
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,520
Colonel, sir.

257
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,880
Colonel, sir.

258
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,060
Please, everyone take a seat.

259
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,320
This aircraft can only carry

260
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,240
700 gallons of fuel,

261
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,640
which is far from enough.

262
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:10,360
Next we'll conduct

263
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,290
low-altitude bombing exercises.

264
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,120
First, we'll drop 100-pound bombs

265
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,200
from an altitude of 300 feet.

266
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,360
The key is to hold steady over the target,

267
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:20,600
release bombs while maintaining level flight,

268
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,680
then get away as fast as possible

269
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,560
to avoid the blast impact.

270
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,170
Once you've mastered that,

271
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,880
we'll train you to drop 500-pound bombs

272
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,920
from 1,500 feet.

273
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,010
Understood?

274
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,320
Yes, sir.

275
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:35,680
Lieutenant,

276
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,240
why are we practicing short takeoffs

277
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,000
and low-altitude bombing?

278
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,200
I'm as curious about that

279
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,480
as you are.

280
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:44,040
If no one has any other questions,

281
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,400
let's get ready.

282
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,720
Move out!

283
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:50,850
Lieutenant.

284
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,300
Gentlemen.

285
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,520
Cole.

286
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,840
Let's take a trip to Washington.

287
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,400
Yes, sir.

288
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,960
Move out now. Let's go.

289
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,840
7707 requesting takeoff.

290
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,320
7707 cleared for takeoff.

291
00:19:09,640 --> 00:19:11,680
7707 taxi to runway.

292
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,040
7707 taking off.

293
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,760
Colonel, the General is waiting for you.

294
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,080
Duncan,

295
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,240
how's the General's mood today?

296
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:26,840
Mood?

297
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,560
I mean, is the General in good spirits today?

298
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,200
What's wrong?

299
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:32,200
You seem to have something on your mind.

300
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,200
Do you remember

301
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,640
what I asked you to help me with before?

302
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,080
I do.

303
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,180
I can't help you with that.

304
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:50,480
Jimmy Doolittle.

305
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:53,020
Good to see you, young man.

306
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,580
How's the training going?

307
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,680
Very well, General.

308
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,520
The volunteers

309
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,240
have already reported to Eglin Base.

310
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,500
The B-25 bombers are being modified now.

311
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,560
Here is

312
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,240
all the details,

313
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,000
written in the report.

314
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,080
Very good.

315
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,720
So,

316
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,980
is there anything else you'd like to add?

317
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:16,040
Yes, General.

318
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,720
Currently I'm only ordered

319
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,980
to train these pilots.

320
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,520
But I believe you need someone

321
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,720
to lead this mission.

322
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,080
I volunteer myself.

323
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:28,920
Jimmy,

324
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,160
without a doubt,

325
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,560
you are the Army's foremost

326
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,560
aviation expert.

327
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,480
But headquarters has a lot of work

328
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,340
that needs you.

329
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:38,960
If we must fight,

330
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,280
we need careful planning

331
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:44,140
not just a contest of brute force.

332
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,600
These young pilots,

333
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,060
they're all working hard.

334
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,400
But they need

335
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,660
real combat training.

336
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,880
No one is more suitable than you,

337
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,610
that's true.

338
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,960
Can we discuss this matter later?

339
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:05,280
General, we're running out of time.

340
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,640
If I lead the team,

341
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,200
the chances of success

342
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,400
and bringing these young men back alive

343
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,130
will increase significantly.

344
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,320
That's probably true,

345
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,680
but I think you and I both know

346
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,200
this mission

347
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,960
may have few survivors.

348
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,600
I'm prepared for the worst,

349
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,360
General.

350
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,200
My family is too.

351
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,720
Let's do this.

352
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:36,800
If

353
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:42,120
Chief of Staff Miff Harmon approves,

354
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,400
I'll give the green light too.

355
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,520
Good luck, Jimmy.

356
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,370
Thank you, General.

357
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,840
The stage is right there.

358
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,960
The band is right there too.

359
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,480
The seat next to me is still empty.

360
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,960
That's what I wanted to point out.

361
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,620
I am indeed waiting for a lady.

362
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,120
Duncan.

363
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,120
I need you to do me a favor.

364
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:03,720
What is it?

365
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,240
Find a report.

366
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,680
Get Commander Arnold to sign it.

367
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,400
Why?

368
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,720
The Commander is using others to do his dirty work.

369
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,840
He's planning to have Chief of Staff Miff Harmon

370
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,280
kick me out.

371
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:12,600
Keep him busy.

372
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:13,720
Don't let him make any calls.

373
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,840
I'll buy you a drink.

374
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:15,720
All right.

375
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:16,680
Sorry.

376
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,240
Excuse me, sir.

377
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,370
What's wrong with you? Got a fire under your tail?

378
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:29,920
Sir,

379
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:32,850
Commander Arnold has approved me to lead the mission

380
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,880
and asked me to get your approval as well.

381
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,480
Is that so?

382
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,160
Then I have no choice but to agree.

383
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,440
No one is more suitable than you.

384
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,220
Thank you, Chief of Staff.

385
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,840
Could you write an order, sir?

386
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:50,960
All right.

387
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,680
Take this to the command office

388
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,240
and

389
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,200
I'll notify them.

390
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,060
This is Harmon.

391
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,160
No, he's here.

392
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:10,800
Really?

393
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,320
Jimmy said this was your idea,

394
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,880
so I approved it.

395
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,600
It's too late to withdraw now.

396
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,080
I've already signed it.

397
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:29,200
Yes.

398
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,980
You're dismissed, Lieutenant Colonel.

399
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,200
Doolittle,

400
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,120
you owe me a drink.

401
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,240
Hope you like sake.

402
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,000
I do.

403
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:57,810
General.

404
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,240
Doolittle.

405
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,920
You know I really don't want to lose you,

406
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,480
Jimmy.

407
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,160
When you go on this mission,

408
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,280
take care of yourself and those boys.

409
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:11,760
I want you to come back in one piece.

410
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,620
I'll pin that medal on you myself.

411
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,080
Yes, General.

412
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,480
Now about Witt Chen.

413
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,320
The Chinese are helping to search for him.

414
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,640
We need to do everything possible

415
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,960
to ensure his safety.

416
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:24,720
But you should also know

417
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,580
I'm sending out his replacement.

418
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,960
So you just focus on your mission,

419
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,450
understood?

420
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,000
Yes, General.

421
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:38,040
Good luck, young man.

422
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:04,760
You take control.

423
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,380
Sir, how was my flying?

424
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:20,920
Not bad.

425
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,840
There are some warning signs.

426
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,400
The left engine isn't breaking in well.

427
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,810
The compass needs recalibration.

428
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,220
The carburetor is a bit loose.

429
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:37,000
There are 12 minor issues with this flight.

430
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,080
Fix them as soon as possible.

431
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,220
What's happening?

432
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,160
The propeller has stopped.

433
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:16,920
Go to the cockpit.

434
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:17,600
Tell the captain

435
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,730
that one of the propellers has failed.

436
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,330
Captain!

437
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,160
The left engine propeller has stopped working!

438
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,360
Go back to your seat.

439
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,080
We've already notified Shanghai airport ground control.

440
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,040
They're preparing fire trucks and ambulances

441
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:32,920
to respond at any moment.

442
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,640
Really?

443
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,290
Go back to your seat.

444
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,680
Don't worry. It's fine.

445
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,320
Colonel,

446
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,440
we only have one engine left.

447
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,440
Please put this on

448
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:43,880
just in case.

449
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,650
Everyone stay calm.

450
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,280
We have parachutes ready.

451
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:50,410
I'll send them to everyone right away.

452
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,450
Put them on quickly.

453
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:55,280
Colonel,

454
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,440
there's a major problem with the plane.

455
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,160
They've already notified

456
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,800
the fire trucks and ambulances.

457
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,920
Colonel, please put this on quickly.

458
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,420
You put it on first.

459
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,960
I need the captain's authorization

460
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,360
to allow me into the cockpit

461
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,960
to help him with the landing.

462
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,800
Colonel!

463
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,320
Colonel!

464
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,420
One of the engines has failed.

465
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,160
With two such young pilots,

466
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,480
which one would make the passengers

467
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,440
more terrified?

468
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,040
Have you identified the cause of the malfunction?

469
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:31,160
Colonel, sir,

470
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,840
we flew from the mainland to Shanghai

471
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,000
through a level 4 thunderstorm area,

472
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,040
which likely caused water to enter one of the engines,

473
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,400
making it inoperable.

474
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,320
Don't be nervous.

475
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,600
The silver lining is

476
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,460
we still have one working engine.

477
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,570
Now listen to me.

478
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,320
Adjust to horizontal mode

479
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,960
Set flaps to ten.

480
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,600
If we can maintain balance,

481
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,660
we can land safely.

482
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:51,280
Yes.

483
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,800
Captain, we have a problem.

484
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,600
The right engine is failing too.

485
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,720
Colonel,

486
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,650
luck doesn't seem to be on our side.

487
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,240
Get out of the way.

488
00:28:23,280 --> 00:28:24,640
Take the co-pilot seat.

489
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,360
Yes.

490
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,000
From now on,

491
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,500
give me your full support.

492
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,360
Yes.

493
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,240
Both of our engines

494
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,160
are now broken.

495
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,200
We can only glide down like a hang glider

496
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,000
until we crash into the ground.

497
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,960
We need to restart the engines.

498
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,960
We need to quickly use the plane's descent

499
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,420
to increase our airspeed.

500
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,360
Let the engines use the airflow speed

501
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,280
to reach the minimum startup rotation speed.

502
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,640
Let it auto-restart.

503
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,280
Report altitude.

504
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,320
Yes.

505
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:07,640
Altitude.

506
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,040
9,000.

507
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,360
Pull the engine lever.

508
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,240
Everyone stay calm.

509
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,840
Return to your seats.

510
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:28,840
Everyone sit down now.

511
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:38,440
8,000.

512
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:40,520
Colonel.

513
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,600
We're losing altitude rapidly.

514
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,160
Ignition system ready.

515
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,080
Pull down to prepare for launch.

516
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,240
7,000.

517
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,640
6,000.

518
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,360
Launch.

519
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,800
Continue flying.

520
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,560
Thank you for your hard work.

521
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:27,690
Please show your ID.

522
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,120
This gentleman's whereabouts must not be recorded.

523
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:39,850
Understood?

524
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:40,420
Yes.

525
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,820
Give it back to him.

526
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,800
Seems the food in Shanghai isn't that great.

527
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,480
Look at you two,

528
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,410
skinny as rails.

529
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,240
I really hoped you wouldn't come.

530
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:02,700
You think I wanted to come?

531
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,160
Early 1930s.

532
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,330
At the most famous spy academy in the Far East,

533
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:09,210
Shanghai Tongwen College,

534
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,660
there were four ambitious young men.

535
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,160
They were still on this street

536
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,690
leading their classmates in a protest march.

537
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,680
Who were these three fools?

538
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,560
Takemoku Ichiro,

539
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:21,880
Akanishi,

540
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,760
and the third fool,

541
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,560
Takizawa.

542
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,700
Wasn't there another person?

543
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:29,240
Who would have thought

544
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,280
that our principal, Konoe Fumimaro,

545
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,440
would become the Prime Minister of Japan.

546
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,320
Stop reminiscing.

547
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,380
Are we that old now?

548
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:37,760
Wait.

549
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,080
I have a surprise for you.

550
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,040
Sir.

551
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,600
Sir.

552
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,680
I haven't met the people from Chongqing yet.

553
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:09,600
So I'm not clear about

554
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:11,080
the specific details of this operation.

555
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,739
But it seems very mysterious.

556
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,280
They only told me the location of the mission,

557
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,199
on Sanzao Island,

558
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:17,260
and asked me to find a way to get there.

559
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,400
We roughly know

560
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,489
why they called you back this time.

561
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,159
An American aircraft

562
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,719
was shot down over Sanzao Island

563
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:30,920
in Zhongshan County.

564
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,330
There was a U.S. Army major on board

565
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,880
who parachuted onto Sanzao Island.

566
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,280
Currently,

567
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,600
there's no news of his capture.

568
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,770
They've awakened you this time

569
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,960
to extract this man

570
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,719
or silence him permanently.

571
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:55,650
Waking up a high-level intelligence strategist

572
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,880
just to complete one rescue mission

573
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,340
isn't that using a cannon to kill a mosquito?

574
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,690
Actually, it's not.

575
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:04,080
We don't know yet

576
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,680
what specific secrets this person possesses.

577
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,080
But according to our intelligence,

578
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:12,280
those currently paying close attention to this matter

579
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,480
are the United States

580
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,600
and the Nationalist government's

581
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,760
highest-level core figures.

582
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,380
The highest level?

583
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,560
You don't mean Roosevelt and Chiang Kai-shek?

584
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,020
That's exactly who I mean.

585
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,600
The Military Statistics Bureau wants us

586
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,120
to select someone

587
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,640
to assist with your operation.

588
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,840
Her name is Ye Biying.

589
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:36,000
She's not a Military Statistics Bureau agent.

590
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,210
She's from our 18th Army Group office,

591
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,460
a trainee doctor in the medical team.

592
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,740
She's a local from Sanzao Island.

593
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,160
The Military Statistics Bureau needs someone

594
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,560
with local connections to assist you,

595
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:47,920
so they chose her.

596
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,090
Understood.

597
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,010
The real difficulty is that

598
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,880
the Military Statistics Bureau might require you

599
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,560
after completing the mission

600
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,300
to eliminate this assistant.

601
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:00,800
If they didn't require that,

602
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,930
it wouldn't be the Military Statistics Bureau's style.

603
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,240
But Comrade Lao Pan asked me to tell you

604
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,800
to use all your power

605
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,780
to protect this assistant

606
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:13,730
and bring her out safely

607
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,720
and back in one piece.

608
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,080
What if we encounter difficulties?

609
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,220
Overcome them.

610
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,050
Understood.

611
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,600
We are now in enemy-occupied territory.

612
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,200
The Japanese and Wang's puppet regime have

613
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,460
spies along the route.

614
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:40,640
Be vigilant when speaking

615
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,600
and aware of your surroundings.

616
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,040
If we encounter a checkpoint,

617
00:36:44,040 --> 00:36:45,040
don't say anything.

618
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:46,600
I'll handle everything.

619
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:56,040
Thank you.

620
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:57,930
Captain Liu.

621
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,440
Mr. Shen.

622
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:00,570
What a coincidence.

623
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,360
Indeed it is.

624
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,240
What's in the bag?

625
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,600
I'm bringing my family member here.

626
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,080
We just arrived in Shanghai.

627
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:04,920
There must be something in there.

628
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:05,640
Open it up.

629
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,960
Why should I show you my belongings?

630
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:10,860
Open it and take a look.

631
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,320
Why so fierce?

632
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,770
If you want to see it, I'll show you.

633
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,440
Xiao Ye.

634
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,040
Um,

635
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,240
let me introduce you.

636
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,240
This is my friend Captain Liu from Shanghai.

637
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:22,240
This is my friend.

638
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,120
Hello.

639
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:24,960
This officer is conducting an inspection.

640
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,000
Come, let's inspect first.

641
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,760
Here, take a look.

642
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:27,220
No need.

643
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,620
What are you doing?

644
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,000
My men don't know better.

645
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:31,840
I apologize for any offense.

646
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,440
It's fine.

647
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,500
Just doing our job.

648
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,080
Do we need to check that?

649
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:35,780
No need.

650
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:36,570
Alright.

651
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,840
Let's get going then.

652
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:38,080
Sure!

653
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:38,760
Let's meet again soon.

654
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,290
Mr. Shen,

655
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,320
after you.

656
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,200
Good. See you.

657
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,080
Be more careful next time.

658
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,080
Didn't I tell you

659
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,410
not to talk carelessly?

660
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,080
Yet you let him check.

661
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:51,210
What if he discovers

662
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,920
the gifts I gave?

663
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,760
Didn't you say

664
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,160
they were all hidden

665
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,600
in that place?

666
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,320
So mischievous.

667
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:10,010
You were the one who said to put them there.

668
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,700
Where are we going now?

669
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,970
To the hospital where you work,

670
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,440
Ruihua Hospital.

671
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,620
One of our secret contact points.

672
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:11,920
Make way, please.

673
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,440
Make way.

674
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,400
Thank you for your hard work.

675
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,130
Here you are.

676
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,840
Director, we've been waiting for you for a while.

677
00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:23,560
Who is this?

678
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,120
This is the comrade I told you about.

679
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,050
Comrade Xiao Ye.

680
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,760
Hello. This is the hospital director.

681
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,480
Let's go inside.

682
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,760
Please brief her on the hospital situation.

683
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,090
Sure. This way, please.

684
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,000
Anti-Japanese agents found in the hospital.

685
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:35,730
Nobody move!

686
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,460
Submit to inspection.

687
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,000
Submit to inspection.

688
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:54,560
Sir.

689
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,970
I'm here to see a doctor.

690
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,130
See a doctor?

691
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,320
Patients need to line up over there.

692
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:01,850
Alright.

693
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:05,760
Go line up over there.

694
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:07,560
Hurry up!

695
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,340
Everyone stand properly!

696
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,920
Don't make trouble!

697
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:13,800
Everyone stand properly!

698
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,920
Men stand on this side.

699
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,320
Women on this side, okay?

700
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:17,960
Sir.

701
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:19,770
Let's begin.

702
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,800
Everyone listen up.

703
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:25,800
Now

704
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,640
we need to verify

705
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,970
all of your identities.

706
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,260
If there are no issues,

707
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,240
you can all go home.

708
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,040
Sir,

709
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,560
everything is ready.

710
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:38,930
Who is the director?

711
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:40,690
Who's the director?

712
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:41,720
It's me.

713
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:42,920
Come here quickly.

714
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:43,920
Hurry.

715
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,480
I am Liu Yiqian,

716
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:47,840
the director of this hospital,

717
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:49,760
living at 17 Anxi Road.

718
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,040
Sir,

719
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:56,360
he is our hospital director, Liu Yiqian.

720
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,200
Do you know all the doctors

721
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,130
and nurses here?

722
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,000
You know all the doctors and nurses here, right?

723
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,130
Yes, I know them all.

724
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,210
I know everyone.

725
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,240
Let's begin.

726
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,320
Are you a doctor?

727
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,530
Are you a doctor?

728
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,320
Yes.

729
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,080
Yes.

730
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,010
What's her name?

731
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,560
What's her name?

732
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,000
Liu Yuhan.

733
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,280
Liu Yuhan.

734
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:35,810
What's her name?

735
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,880
Yes, sir.

736
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,120
Don't run!

737
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,120
Don't move! Stand still!

738
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,160
Everyone move over there!

739
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:59,000
Stand properly!

740
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:00,460
Quickly, move over there!

741
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,160
What do you do?

742
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:05,960
What's your occupation?

743
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,180
The officer is asking what you do.

744
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,250
What's your job?

745
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:19,800
Are you a doctor

746
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,240
or a patient?

747
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,080
Are you a doctor or a patient?

748
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,360
I'm talking to you!
