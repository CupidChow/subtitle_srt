1
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,020
What are you doing?

2
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,440
I know now.

3
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,970
You're not that simple.

4
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,410
Neither you nor that Japanese are simple.

5
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,120
There's something between you two.

6
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,330
You came to the island at this time.

7
00:01:54,039 --> 00:01:55,200
It must be for

8
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,520
getting married.

9
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,360
Are you

10
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,520
planning to get married?

11
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,400
Am I right?

12
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,360
Why are you pointing at me?

13
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,600
Do you believe it or not?

14
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,720
You didn't dare point at me when we were kids.

15
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,320
What are you pointing at now?

16
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,479
You really hit me?

17
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,009
You've been gone for years.

18
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:10,919
I'm not done with you.

19
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:12,080
Good strength.

20
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,400
Mrs. Si.

21
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,200
What are you two fighting about?

22
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,400
Your sister just came home,

23
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,260
and you're already bullying her?

24
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,520
Look, she hit me.

25
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,360
Yingying,

26
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,360
come with me to my old house.

27
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,120
Tonight,

28
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,360
we'll stay together.

29
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,940
You're the best, Grandma.

30
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,090
Let's go.

31
00:02:36,079 --> 00:02:36,740
Hitting me?

32
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,530
I'll beat you up!

33
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,930
Ye Longxia, you better run!

34
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,960
Today at that old Ye's house,

35
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,690
we might have found something.

36
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:47,600
Unfortunately, I don't know how Commander Fujita

37
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,200
found out about this matter.

38
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,040
He sent Deputy Sakamoto

39
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,320
to stop our operation.

40
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,920
That Ye's daughter is really arrogant.

41
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,400
Could it be that the Commander gave those orders

42
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,800
because of that woman?

43
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,560
I see.

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,840
No matter how I look at that woman,

45
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,570
she doesn't seem like a dancer.

46
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:25,079
During my years in Shanghai's concession area,

47
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:27,079
I encountered many dancers.

48
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,800
I can tell by their eyes at a glance.

49
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,640
They're not sensitive at all

50
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,360
to men touching their bodies.

51
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,820
This woman doesn't have any of these traits.

52
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,960
Captain Inoue is indeed an expert in this area.

53
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,680
This is my specialty.

54
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,320
However,

55
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:48,079
I don't think she seems like a spy either.

56
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:53,200
She lacks the characteristics of a spy.

57
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,000
Spies have extremely strong psychological qualities.

58
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,680
This woman...

59
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,520
But gets agitated easily,

60
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,920
doesn't seem trained for this kind of work.

61
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,340
All right, I'll head back now.

62
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,680
Dad's home alone.

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:08,640
You should go.

64
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:10,080
Go keep the master company.

65
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,600
Okay.

66
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,960
Please comfort him for me.

67
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,440
Sure.

68
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,040
You all should get some rest.

69
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,680
When you were little,

70
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,680
you often stayed here with Grandma.

71
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,890
Why are you still

72
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,900
exactly the same as when you were a child?

73
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,000
I've been waiting day

74
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,960
and night

75
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,320
for you to come back home.

76
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,120
Grandma,

77
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:45,490
I've missed you so much.

78
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,640
I've missed you too.

79
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,480
You smell so nice.

80
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,520
What smell could I possibly have?

81
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,980
Just the scent of doing laundry and cooking,

82
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,840
kitchen smoke and soap.

83
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,920
That's the smell of home.

84
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,780
It's so good to be home.

85
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,520
My dear Yingying,

86
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,240
let me ask you something.

87
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,280
What's going on

88
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,960
between you and that Japanese guy?

89
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,640
What's the story?

90
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:23,690
Grandma,

91
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,240
can we not talk about the Japanese man,

92
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:26,880
please?

93
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,480
Alright,

94
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,400
we won't.

95
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,140
We won't talk about it.

96
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,440
Would you like me to sing you a song?

97
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,200
Little duckling.

98
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,680
Quack,

99
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,159
yellow little feet,

100
00:05:49,159 --> 00:05:51,680
flat little beak.

101
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,960
I still think

102
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,940
This woman is suspicious.

103
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,960
Colonel Wumu has probably been

104
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,720
bewitched by this Chinese woman and lost his judgment.

105
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:05,520
Tonight,

106
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,520
I will bring that Tang Ju'er here

107
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,250
for a thorough interrogation.

108
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,640
The Colonel won't come here, right?

109
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,280
How could he possibly come?

110
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,880
This is our territory.

111
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,800
Don't worry. It'll be fine.

112
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,600
Report, Colonel.

113
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,080
Colonel,

114
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,640
it's an honor to have you

115
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,159
visit us again.

116
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,820
I'm not pleased at all.

117
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,640
Your Special Police Unit

118
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,170
has given me the impression

119
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,770
of poor discipline,

120
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,600
bullying the weak,

121
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,600
and harassing women on this island.

122
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,000
Today's incident must be a misunderstanding.

123
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,730
Misunderstanding?

124
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,690
So what I witnessed this afternoon

125
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,560
wasn't real?

126
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,480
No.

127
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,000
Colonel, you saw correctly.

128
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,240
The local woman you encountered

129
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,120
is a nurse at our military hospital.

130
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,120
She often works with Captain Inoue.

131
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,480
Their playful interactions are quite common.

132
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:34,840
Is that so?

133
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,440
Yes.

134
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,930
Playful interactions?

135
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:44,800
Playful?

136
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,680
What are you doing?

137
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,880
Just playing around?

138
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:49,880
Just playing?

139
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,120
Don't be nervous.

140
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,280
What are you doing?

141
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,440
Playing around?

142
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,920
Don't move.

143
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,240
Colonel.

144
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,280
Has Sasaki sworn an oath to His Majesty the Emperor?

145
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:07,760
What are you going to do?

146
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,400
I remember the officer's oath.

147
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,840
It should be: 'I will obey all orders

148
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,040
of His Majesty the Emperor,

149
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,880
and I will obey

150
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,320
any commands from superior officers

151
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,380
appointed by Him.'

152
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:16,240
Am I correct?

153
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,960
You are correct, sir.

154
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,200
What you should say now is:

155
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:19,880
'Yes, sir.'

156
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:20,800
Yes, sir.

157
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,800
Wait.

158
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,000
I order you now

159
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,159
to put Captain Inoue in solitary confinement.

160
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:44,800
Yes.

161
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,860
Execute immediately.

162
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,850
What the hell is that guy doing?

163
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,160
Disgusting.

164
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,640
Behave yourself.

165
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
What do you want?

166
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:52,080
Ying'er doesn't want to come back.

167
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,080
She's staying at Fourth Aunt's place tonight.

168
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,680
You should get some rest too.

169
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,610
Bring her back first thing tomorrow morning.

170
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,120
I'll have another talk with her.

171
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:02,650
Alright.

172
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,100
Didn't you talk to her?

173
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,540
About what?

174
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,050
About the Japanese.

175
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,320
No.

176
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,760
I didn't bother asking her.

177
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,280
She doesn't even tell you the truth.

178
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,480
Why would she tell me?

179
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,280
Get some rest.

180
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,160
You're Takeki Ichiro, right?

181
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:44,960
Get out of the car.

182
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,090
I need to talk to you.

183
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,530
I don't know you.

184
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,160
There's nothing to talk about.

185
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,090
Get out of my way.

186
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,120
I am Ye Longxia, the Mountain Tiger.

187
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,240
You're Ye Biying's brother, aren't you?

188
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,570
What do you want from me?

189
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,360
I'm here to warn you.

190
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:13,920
Stay away from my sister.

191
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,260
If I see you looking for her again,

192
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,240
I'll kill you.

193
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,130
It's too late today,

194
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,700
not a good time to talk.

195
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,610
I'll visit you another day.

196
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,410
Go back to sleep.

197
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,090
You don't understand what I'm saying?

198
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,320
Are you deaf or mute?

199
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,880
I swear I'll kill you right now.

200
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:43,960
Bastard!

201
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,920
Put down your weapon.

202
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,380
Put it down!

203
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:51,760
Bastard!

204
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:24,360
Two-one.

205
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,000
One-two-one.

206
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,480
One, two, three, four.

207
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,040
One, two, three, four.

208
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,440
One-two-one.

209
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,560
One, two, three, four.

210
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,720
One-two-one.

211
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,320
One, two, three, four.

212
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:39,760
One-two-one.

213
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,360
One, two, three, four.

214
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,760
One, two, three, four.

215
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,720
One-two-one.

216
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,120
One, two, three, four.

217
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,360
One, two, three, four.

218
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,080
One, two, three, four.

219
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,280
One, two, three, four.

220
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,240
One, two, one.

221
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,240
One, two, three, four.

222
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,600
Grandma.

223
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,120
Sister.

224
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:05,520
Sister.

225
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:09,440
Sister.

226
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:22,000
Brother.

227
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:23,570
Brother.

228
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,120
Brother.

229
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:38,760
Uncle.

230
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,120
Miss,

231
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,720
I'm not feeling well today,

232
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,050
let's do it another day.

233
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,480
Uncle.

234
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,080
Mrs. Liu.

235
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,370
Good morning. Long time no see.

236
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,480
Miss Ye,

237
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,240
what brings you here?

238
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,120
I haven't been back for a long time,

239
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,980
so I came to say hello to everyone.

240
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,120
You're picking rice?

241
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,000
Let me help you.

242
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,960
If there's nothing else,

243
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,480
please leave now.

244
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:13,200
I'm busy here.

245
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:15,920
How is Mr. Liu?

246
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,280
He's fine,

247
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,290
taken by the Japanese as forced labor.

248
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:25,280
Miss, please just go.

249
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:47,960
Mr. Wang

250
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:51,280
Mr. Wang

251
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,410
Long time no see.

252
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,930
Isn't this Ying'er?

253
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,370
You're really back.

254
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,020
You've really grown up beautifully.

255
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,640
Much prettier than when you were little.

256
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,960
Mr. Wang, you still look as energetic as ever.

257
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,319
I heard yesterday

258
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,760
that the Ye family's young lady had returned.

259
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,089
We couldn't believe it.

260
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:17,119
Sanzao Island has been surrounded by Japanese

261
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:18,960
for years now.

262
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,960
No one can get in or out,

263
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,540
so how did you manage to come back?

264
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,920
It took quite some effort.

265
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,360
I have some business to attend to,

266
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,640
I'll come visit another day.

267
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,970
Mr. Wang, wait a moment.

268
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,040
I heard that a few days ago

269
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,080
a plane fell from the sky.

270
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,520
Is that true?

271
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,560
You mean the American plane?

272
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:48,760
Yes.

273
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,480
That Tang Bingchen

274
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,480
has been announcing it everywhere.

275
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,880
Everyone knows about it.

276
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,080
He also said

277
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,080
there's an American

278
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,360
hiding on the island.

279
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,770
What else did he say?

280
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,160
He also said

281
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:07,720
whoever turns in this American,

282
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,200
the Japanese

283
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:11,650
will reward them with 50 jin of rice

284
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,920
and 20 jin of pork.

285
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:15,400
Mr. Wang,

286
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,240
have you seen this person?

287
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:20,490
Ying'er,

288
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:21,880
to tell you the truth,

289
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,410
I haven't even seen a shadow of this American.

290
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,800
Even if I had seen him,

291
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,440
I wouldn't trade him for rice.

292
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,440
Don't you agree?

293
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,930
Well, I'll come visit another day.

294
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,600
See you soon.

295
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,160
Are you Yu Tongtong?

296
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:42,840
Yes, yes, yes.

297
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,240
It's definitely me.

298
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:44,920
It's me.

299
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,320
How old are you this year?

300
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,000
Over 30.

301
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,920
Over 30?

302
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,240
Yes, yes, yes. That's definitely me.

303
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,040
That's right.

304
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,360
Is anyone else at home?

305
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:54,640
No.

306
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,080
So fair and radiant

307
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,000
with those big eyes.

308
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:57,880
How beautiful!

309
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,490
Why did you find a Japanese boy?

310
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,560
Darling,

311
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,120
it's not good to deal with Japanese.

312
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,680
They're so inhumane.

313
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,920
Grandma, come back for your porridge.

314
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,800
Remember,

315
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,520
don't get involved with Japanese.

316
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,680
The porridge is getting cold.

317
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,680
Remember that.

318
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,640
Mrs. Si

319
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,120
Yingying

320
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,480
Where did you run off to so early?

321
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,000
It's been too long since I came back.

322
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,960
So I went for a walk around the village.

323
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,040
Are you hungry?

324
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,240
I'll go make breakfast for the master.

325
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,160
Wait, please.

326
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:14,760
What is it?

327
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,290
Sit down.

328
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,440
I need to ask you something.

329
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,200
What is it?

330
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:20,080
Recently,

331
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,240
has anyone come here?

332
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:23,320
Visitors?

333
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:26,800
Who came?

334
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,400
I'm asking you.

335
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,600
How would I know?

336
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,140
Really, no one.

337
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,560
Truly no one.

338
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,080
Then what is this?

339
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,840
This is a needle.

340
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:45,810
Haven't seen it before?

341
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,080
No, I haven't.

342
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:48,560
Alright.

343
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,620
Then it's nothing.

344
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,440
Yinger.

345
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,530
You're here.

346
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,480
Dad sent me to bring you back.

347
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,050
I'll go make breakfast for the master.

348
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:01,800
Let's go then.

349
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:02,760
Yinger.

350
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,240
That Major who came with you,

351
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,560
are you sure he's a Japanese officer?

352
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:10,760
You called him Major,

353
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,360
what else would he be if not a Japanese officer?

354
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,520
What's wrong?

355
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,760
Nothing.

356
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,080
Really nothing?

357
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:19,880
It's nothing.

358
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:26,930
Brother.

359
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,300
Brother, why are you walking so fast?

360
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,920
I'm talking to you.

361
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,500
What's wrong with you?

362
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,520
Nothing's wrong.

363
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,160
I'm fine.

364
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:38,600
Nothing?

365
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,460
Really, it's nothing.

366
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,360
When you say nothing's wrong, something is definitely wrong.

367
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:44,000
Let's go.

368
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:44,860
Dad is waiting.

369
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,040
Dad isn't angry with me anymore?

370
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,960
Why did he ask me to come back?

371
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,410
I don't know either.

372
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,160
Don't ask anymore.

373
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,820
You'll know when we get there.

374
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,040
Listen to me.

375
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,880
Whatever happens at home,

376
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,160
you need to tell me immediately.

377
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,160
Don't hide anything from me.

378
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,640
What are you talking about?

379
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,680
What hiding?

380
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,240
What could possibly be hidden from you?

381
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,120
Did you hear me?

382
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,040
Fine.

383
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:13,850
Let's go.

384
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:17,960
Yingying,

385
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,200
let's go.

386
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,860
The master is waiting for you.

387
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,200
Acting so strange.

388
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,200
Yingying, stop arguing.

389
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,880
I'll go prepare some food.

390
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,900
Put in a good word for me, brother.

391
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,560
Dad, we're back.

392
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,160
Follow me.

393
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,920
Is this the place?

394
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,080
Where is the scout's bed?

395
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,160
Here.

396
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,320
Is this it?

397
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:41,840
Last night when this sentinel was changing shifts,

398
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,040
he wasn't at his post.

399
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,760
We thought he came back early,

400
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,000
so we didn't pay attention.

401
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,260
It was only this morning that we discovered he was missing.

402
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,380
Is this the person?

403
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:09,680
Yes.

404
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,920
What time did he go on duty?

405
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,690
He took over at 9:30 last night,

406
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,040
and was relieved at 11:30.

407
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:19,120
Did anyone notice anything unusual?

408
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,080
No.

409
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,680
Send someone immediately to find

410
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,920
the list of personnel who returned

411
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,780
to the camp after 9:30 last night.

412
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:32,960
Where's the sentry post?

413
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,080
Take me there.

414
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:41,650
Captain.

415
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,480
From that sentry post up there,

416
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,760
down to this position,

417
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,160
extending all the way over there,

418
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,360
this entire area

419
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,760
is all within our lookout post's coverage.

420
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:01,730
Captain.

421
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,680
The list of personnel who returned to the barracks

422
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,200
after 9:30 last night.

423
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,420
Any suspicious individuals?

424
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,560
This is a colonel who was

425
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,320
assigned quarters by headquarters yesterday.

426
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,160
He also returned after 9:30.

427
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,040
Colonel.

428
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,280
Could it be that new colonel?

429
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,280
That's right.

430
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,880
I know he left the police station

431
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,400
after 9:30.

432
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,960
Listen up, everyone.

433
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,560
I need precise locations.

434
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,120
Search inch by inch.

435
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,180
We must find the primary crime scene.

436
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:36,880
Xia'er,

437
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,280
Ying'er.

438
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,450
Both of you, kneel down.

439
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,600
Bow three times to the villagers.

440
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,240
Father,

441
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,840
who are

442
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,520
all these people?

443
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,560
In 1938,

444
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,620
the 12th day of the third lunar month.

445
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:26,720
That day,

446
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,000
the weather was fine.

447
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,820
At seven in the morning...

448
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:37,980
Fellow villagers,

449
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,520
listen to me.

450
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,920
Today

451
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,560
you'll be issued good citizen certificates.

452
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,520
Everyone

453
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,200
must gather here.

454
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:47,900
From now on,

455
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,880
anyone without a certificate

456
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:51,680
will be sent straight to prison.

457
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:54,800
Now,

458
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,320
form two lines.

459
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,000
Everyone form two lines!

460
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:20,160
Man's nature at birth is inherently good.

461
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:26,040
Our natures are similar, but habits make us different.

462
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:31,640
Without proper teaching, one's nature will change.

463
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:37,480
The way of teaching values dedication.

464
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:43,480
In ancient times, Mencius's mother chose their neighborhood wisely.

465
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:49,760
When her son wouldn't study, she cut the weaving loom.

466
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:55,800
Dou Yanshan had righteous methods.

467
00:30:55,800 --> 00:31:01,640
He taught his five sons, and all became renowned.

468
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:07,320
Raising without teaching is the father's fault.

469
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:13,200
Teaching without strictness is the teacher's laziness.

470
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,440
Among the 36 villages on the island,

471
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,280
with over 12,800 people,

472
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,400
some were killed, others fled.

473
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,000
In the end, only Tanjiawan

474
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,570
and Shangbiao villages remained,

475
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,280
with just over 1,800 people.

476
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,080
What you're kneeling before now

477
00:32:40,280 --> 00:32:42,080
is a mass grave of 10,000 people.

478
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:47,040
Additionally, at the west entrance of Yunong Village,

479
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,370
there's another grave with 1,000 people.

480
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,720
In each village,

481
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,890
there are graves with hundreds of people.

482
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,800
Why did this happen?

483
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,320
There's no simple explanation.

484
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,360
Your father had been to many places.

485
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,920
The Japanese militarists

486
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:13,120
were the most inhumane soldiers

487
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,240
I have ever encountered.

488
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,200
They were nothing but a group of beasts.

489
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,360
At the beginning of 1938,

490
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,700
you left Guangzhou and headed north.

491
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,880
That same year,

492
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,010
the Japanese occupied Sanzao Island.

493
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:33,680
That's why

494
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,480
your family completely lost contact with you.

495
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,160
You knew nothing

496
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,250
about everything that happened here.

497
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,770
During those years,

498
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,840
all the island residents

499
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,290
experienced a massacre

500
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,960
that violated human justice

501
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,600
and conscience.

502
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,320
I brought you here

503
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,380
because I want to tell you something.

504
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,679
All the villagers on this island

505
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,690
see the Japanese as their enemies.

506
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,400
You cannot be with that Japanese soldier.

507
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,320
I will never accept this.

508
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:28,880
If you stay with that Japanese officer,

509
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,080
none of the surviving villagers

510
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,520
will accept you either.

511
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:53,800
Ying'er.

512
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,159
Didn't you ask me

513
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,000
why Kewen has become like this?

514
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:03,720
He crawled out from a pile of corpses.

515
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,370
I should go home now.

516
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,860
When he discovered

517
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:03,840
that the entire Caotang Village

518
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,440
had only him left,

519
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,920
his former self

520
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,920
could no longer survive.

521
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:13,650
Ying'er,

522
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,620
listen to your father.

523
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,960
Stop seeing that Japanese officer.

524
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,620
A living person just disappeared like that.

525
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,520
It's unbelievable.

526
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:01,280
I'll go find a place to sit down first.

527
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:22,120
Sir.

528
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:23,720
is called Colonel.

529
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,520
Colonel, sir.

530
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,810
I apologize for yesterday's offense.

531
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:29,920
Please enjoy your meal.

532
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,080
Sasaki.

533
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,490
Sit down and join me for dinner.

534
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,730
Have a seat and dine with me.

535
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,480
I'm honored.

536
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,440
Thank you.

537
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,200
Captain Inoue

538
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,080
did you sleep in the detention cell last night?

539
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:57,400
Of course. The Colonel's two-day punishment isn't over yet.

540
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,930
I didn't dare to come out without permission.

541
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:05,640
The officers' mess hall food is quite good.

542
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,640
Yes, indeed.

543
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,880
Navy breakfast is always better than the Army's.

544
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:21,720
Pilots' breakfast is always better than officers'.

545
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:22,880
An extra egg

546
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,280
and a piece of chocolate.

547
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,600
Do you know?

548
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,600
There are many girls in Tokyo

549
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,080
who would marry a pilot

550
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,760
just to get that piece of chocolate.

551
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:34,760
Chocolate is delicious. Being a young widow must be hard.

552
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,320
Thank you.

553
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:58,600
Help yourselves.

554
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:03,760
This is yours, Colonel.

555
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:04,820
Please, have some.

556
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,800
Thank you.

557
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,600
Go ahead and eat.

558
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:19,880
Thanks.

559
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,680
What made you decide to have breakfast here?

560
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,880
Doesn't the police unit have a canteen?

561
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:33,760
Last night,

562
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,960
a sentry from the garrison went missing.

563
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:36,560
This kind of incident

564
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:38,360
hasn't happened for over a year.

565
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,360
We've investigated

566
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:40,440
everyone who returned to the barracks

567
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,640
after 9:30 last night.

568
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:48,970
That should include me too.

569
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:51,400
So you're here to investigate me?

570
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,760
This has nothing to do with you, sir.

571
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,040
According to our preliminary investigation,

572
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:08,000
the missing sentry...

573
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,360
It's closely related to the Chinese.

574
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,840
How could this happen?

575
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,040
Does it happen often?

576
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,440
Since landing on the island in Showa 13,

577
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,640
nearly 40 soldiers

578
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,500
have gone missing or been killed.

579
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,080
The worst incident,

580
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,520
they killed 12 of our men.

581
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:28,640
It's truly a detestable place.

582
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,860
Why is this happening?

583
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,320
Sanzao Island is not far from Macau.

584
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,680
That place can hide anything.

585
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:38,760
Macau?

586
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:40,680
Yes.

587
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,360
Macau is Portuguese territory,

588
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,840
a neutral zone.

589
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,880
The night before last,

590
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:49,440
the ones who attacked our transport ship Amemaru

591
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,080
were Chiang's gunboats hiding there.

592
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:55,040
There are also gangs and assassins there

593
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,500
who frequently cause trouble on our island.

594
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,240
That shouldn't be difficult.

595
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,400
Such a small place -

596
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,660
why not just send troops and take it over?

597
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,600
We can't.

598
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,000
We can occupy China, the Philippines, Burma,

599
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,680
Singapore and Hong Kong,

600
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:14,720
but we cannot occupy

601
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:15,780
Portuguese Macau.

602
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,120
Why not?

603
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,240
Apparently Brazil sent our Foreign Ministry

604
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,240
a diplomatic note

605
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,120
stating that

606
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:22,920
if we forcibly occupy Macau,

607
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:24,040
Brazil would expel

608
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,960
all 3 million Japanese residents there

609
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:28,080
back to Japan.

610
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,000
The military is concerned that

611
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,440
if these 3 million Japanese were sent home,

612
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,400
it would cause domestic chaos beyond control.

613
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:36,120
Therefore,

614
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,240
we're strictly ordered not to provoke that area.

615
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,680
That's how it is.

616
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,880
I didn't expect that a company commander like you

617
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:41,940
would know so much.

618
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:46,040
This is all what our battalion commander told us.

619
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:46,900
Captain Inoue?

620
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:49,320
Yes, Captain Inoue.

621
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:50,920
Isn't that right?

622
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:51,440
Yes.

623
00:41:58,320 --> 00:41:59,240
It seems that

624
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,090
this island isn't safe either.

625
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,920
I think we should ask Battalion Commander Inoue

626
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,600
to assign two men to you.

627
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,240
That would be safer.

628
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:14,480
Do you think the Emperor's chamberlains

629
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,520
are some random gang members

630
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,880
who can get close to me?

631
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,880
Finish eating before you leave.

632
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:29,400
Thank you.
