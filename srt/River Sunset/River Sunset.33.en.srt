1
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,640
Colonel.

2
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,520
Calm down.

3
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,320
Take it easy.

4
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,320
Get out!

5
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:38,520
Stay calm.

6
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,880
Please calm down,

7
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,960
Colonel.

8
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,690
I'll only say this once.

9
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,080
In two hours,

10
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,120
I want this plane.

11
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:50,289
I'll arrange it right away.

12
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,640
This Bible of mine

13
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,579
You've read it already, haven't you?

14
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,560
You're a high-level strategic intelligence officer.

15
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,760
The secrets hidden

16
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,280
between pages 24 and 34

17
00:02:30,079 --> 00:02:32,520
I believe you've already figured them out.

18
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,720
The first nine pages indeed conceal

19
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,079
a complete radio beacon.

20
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,840
The last page contains a password and call sign.

21
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,200
My mission is to reach

22
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,460
Quzhou Airport in China before April 18.

23
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,000
Enter the radio beacon from the Bible

24
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,880
into the long-range hertz frequency

25
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,120
signal machine from General Stilwell.

26
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:00,120
A bomber squadron will follow

27
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,980
the hertz frequency radio beacon

28
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,360
to Quzhou Airport.

29
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,320
I'll be waiting there to receive them.

30
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,720
Are they bombing Tokyo?

31
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:36,680
Our forces plan on April 18th

32
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,680
to send a squadron of B-25 bombers.

33
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,400
Attack on Tokyo.

34
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,040
If before April 18,

35
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,730
we fail to deliver this intelligence,

36
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,280
these planes

37
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:53,079
will not be able to safely land in China.

38
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,760
No matter what happens,

39
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,130
whichever one of us,

40
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,970
you or me, survives,

41
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,920
must deliver this intelligence

42
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,450
safely to its destination.

43
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,240
Because from now on,

44
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,200
it's me.

45
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,400
Is it fun?

46
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,690
Try this one.

47
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,800
Do you know how to play with this?

48
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,240
Like this.

49
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,440
Would you teach your sister how to play?

50
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,040
Thank you, sir.

51
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,560
Take this and go play over there.

52
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,720
Send an encrypted telegram immediately.

53
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,920
Inform the director.

54
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,720
Send it exactly as written here.

55
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,560
Word for word.

56
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,360
The message Wu Mu left behind

57
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,320
gave the desperate Military Statistics Bureau

58
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,840
a glimmer of hope.

59
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,960
Although both believers were reported dead,

60
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,680
Wu Mu clearly stated that

61
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,080
Ye Biying had memorized all the codes and call signs.

62
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,370
He wanted to return to the island to bring her out.

63
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,240
It's a blessing in disguise

64
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,320
and it's their

65
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,159
only remaining hope.

66
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,400
Longze reported to the Party organization

67
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,320
that Ye Biying is now the only one who knows the call sign,

68
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,960
beacon and codes.

69
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,000
I must go back and bring her out.

70
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,570
Understood. Take care.

71
00:06:51,159 --> 00:06:52,360
Luo Zhiyong saw

72
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,840
the Japanese police squad

73
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,120
loading the patrol boats

74
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,159
with lots of gasoline and explosives.

75
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:58,120
If lifting the sea ban

76
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:58,920
is just to allow people

77
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,320
to go fishing at sea,

78
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,180
why would they need these things?

79
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,240
I've already talked to Wumu

80
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,280
about staying to save our villagers.

81
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,840
De Gong,

82
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,680
something terrible happened!

83
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,920
They've arrested my Ju'er!

84
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,160
What happened to Ju'er?

85
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:16,620
Daodao Hao brought his men

86
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,400
and took Ju'er away.

87
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,760
She's locked up in the police station jail.

88
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,520
I have to save her.

89
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,720
Where are you going?

90
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:23,640
What should we do now?

91
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:24,120
You can't go.

92
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,920
Calm down.

93
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,640
I am calm now,

94
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,920
but I have to save her.

95
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,760
What are you going to do?

96
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,200
Get yourself killed?

97
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,920
If you sacrifice yourself,

98
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,800
you still won't be able to save her.

99
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,120
I don't care.

100
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,600
Even if I die,

101
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,720
I still have to save her.

102
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,250
Don't go!

103
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:36,960
Don't stop me.

104
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,490
Don't go.

105
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,480
Look at what time it is.

106
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,560
Stop right there.

107
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,040
It's all because of you.

108
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,760
If she wasn't helping you,

109
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:44,520
would Ju'er

110
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,520
have been captured by the Japanese?

111
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,520
If anything happens to Ju'er,

112
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,159
I won't go on living.

113
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:52,080
You're right.

114
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,520
This is all my fault.

115
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,560
Now I have to make it right.

116
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:55,200
You can't go.

117
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:55,800
Let me go.

118
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,080
You can't go there.

119
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:56,840
I have to save her.

120
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,120
How will you make amends?

121
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,040
Stop arguing.

122
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,200
Xia'er.

123
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,360
Do you remember what

124
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,640
you told me that day?

125
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,500
If you love her,

126
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,560
then marry her.

127
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,880
What's happening outside?

128
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:34,610
I don't know.

129
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,490
Translator Luo.

130
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,409
Translator Luo.

131
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,400
Commander.

132
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,080
What's going on outside?

133
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:50,840
Today is

134
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,960
Young Master Ye Longxia of the Ye family

135
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,960
and Miss Tang Ju'er of the Tang family's

136
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,040
scheduled auspicious wedding day.

137
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,970
They're getting married shortly.

138
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,800
Go get Sakamoto

139
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,280
to prepare some gifts for them.

140
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,520
The items are in my study.

141
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,920
Deliver them to Mr. Ye De personally.

142
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,050
Yes, sir.

143
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:18,640
The witness detonated a suicide device

144
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,770
and killed himself.

145
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,360
Interesting.

146
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,210
Colonel Wumu will be back soon.

147
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:28,920
Yes.

148
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,280
How would Private Jiexin have a self-destruct device?

149
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,480
Something's wrong with this witness.

150
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,000
Is there a connection or not?

151
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,640
Tell me!

152
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,920
Damn it!

153
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,600
What's the situation?

154
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,480
No progress yet.

155
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,560
Untie her.

156
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,120
Yes.

157
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,320
Are you okay?

158
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,850
I just want to ask you

159
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,600
what's the connection between Colonel Wumu's

160
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,160
and Inoue's deaths?

161
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,010
There's no connection.

162
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,610
How do you know there isn't?

163
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,080
Let me ask you another question.

164
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,800
Who was the person

165
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,040
that flew with Colonel Wumu

166
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,480
on that plane?

167
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,920
Jiexin.

168
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,360
Private Jiexin.

169
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,450
What's going on?

170
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:40,080
I don't know either.

171
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,010
Captain Sasaki.

172
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:16,970
What does this mean?

173
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,640
The commander

174
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,720
Mr. Ye

175
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:23,160
asked me to return the gifts.

176
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,240
Why?

177
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,320
He said

178
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,400
his daughter-in-law Tang Ju'er

179
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,600
is now at the police station

180
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,720
in Captain Oshima's prison,

181
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,280
her fate unknown,

182
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,140
so there's nothing to celebrate.

183
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,290
What exactly happened?

184
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,760
I heard Captain Oshima

185
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,400
just arrested Tang Ju'er,

186
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,080
but he didn't know

187
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,320
today is Tang Ju'er and Ye Longxia's

188
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,560
wedding day.

189
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,840
On such a joyous day,

190
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:49,200
to encounter prison misfortune

191
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,120
is considered a terrible omen.

192
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,880
In Sanzao Island's customs,

193
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,840
it's highly taboo.

194
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,880
Sakamoto.

195
00:12:59,280 --> 00:12:59,760
Yes.

196
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Call Oshima Hiroshi

197
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,920
and ask what's going on.

198
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:02,800
Understood.

199
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,400
You go out too.

200
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,040
Are you sure he's a private?

201
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,480
Why can't he speak?

202
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,280
His throat is injured.

203
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:39,760
It hasn't healed yet?

204
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,640
It still hasn't healed?

205
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,200
What is this thing?

206
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,480
Tan Shenglin

207
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,400
Tan Shenglin

208
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,560
Yu Yonghua

209
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,520
Wait.

210
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,080
What happened?

211
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,520
You Japanese have committed a serious taboo.

212
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,040
Fellow villagers!

213
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,080
This is

214
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,120
a fortune slip from Goddess Mazu.

215
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,760
Today at dusk,

216
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:41,400
if my daughter Ju'er and Long Xia don't get married,

217
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,280
then

218
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,960
we'll offend Goddess Mazu.

219
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,920
Isn't that right?

220
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,040
Yes, indeed.

221
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,960
Arrest them.

222
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,920
We dare not offend Goddess Mazu.

223
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,280
Isn't that right, folks?

224
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,360
Yes, indeed.

225
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:58,960
Let's go see.

226
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,480
Let's look.

227
00:14:59,480 --> 00:14:59,960
Chairman Tang,

228
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,560
come here.

229
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,000
Are you causing trouble?

230
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,760
Come here.

231
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,600
Follow me.

232
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:05,600
Let's go.

233
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:08,840
I know.

234
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,200
This is

235
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,840
throat medicine,

236
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,400
right?

237
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:24,000
Then why is it lying here?

238
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,240
Please cooperate,

239
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,120
will you?

240
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,120
Report,

241
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,120
Captain.

242
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,580
Headquarters is calling.

243
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,080
Think carefully.

244
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,320
Let me in.

245
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,000
I need to see Captain Oshima.

246
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,200
I believe

247
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,450
he would also want to talk to me.

248
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,760
Yes, this is Oshima.

249
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,160
Yes.

250
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,319
That young nurse is very suspicious.

251
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,079
I know what I'm doing.

252
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:10,740
Just trying to scare her a bit.

253
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:15,000
I see.

254
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,960
What a coincidence.

255
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:20,280
I understand.

256
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,760
I'll try my best to bring you good news.

257
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,160
Got it.

258
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,320
Have you decided yet?

259
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,400
Tie her up.

260
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:10,480
Look.

261
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,880
You can choose for yourself.

262
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,450
Which one is better?

263
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,360
Come on,

264
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,930
I'll choose for you.

265
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:33,360
Report,

266
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:34,360
Captain.

267
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,480
Deputy Sakamoto just called again.

268
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,360
He asked me to tell you

269
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,040
Commander Fujita ordered him to come immediately

270
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,840
to watch you torture this woman.

271
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,800
This trick again.

272
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,770
I'll count to three.

273
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:03,720
You tell me.

274
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,240
Stop!

275
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:25,840
Miss Ye.

276
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:28,810
What does this mean?

277
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,240
Today is Tang Ju'er and my brother's

278
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,200
wedding day.

279
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:34,760
Let her go.

280
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,040
I'll stay.

281
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,880
What I want to know is

282
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:43,320
who exactly Major Wumu took away.

283
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,000
The person Wumu took away

284
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,000
was Private Jiexin.

285
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,120
Don't move!

286
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,860
If you touch her again,

287
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,010
I'll shoot you dead.

288
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,360
Put the gun down now!

289
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,880
If you shoot,

290
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,880
neither of you will survive.

291
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:07,880
Everything she knows

292
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:09,720
I know too.

293
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,800
What I know

294
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,200
you must be more interested in.

295
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,200
That private

296
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,050
with the severe throat injury.

297
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:34,000
Look,

298
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,480
you didn't give him medicine for his throat.

299
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:47,760
This man has been in the hospital all along.

300
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:52,520
You know his condition better than anyone.

301
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:53,200
No.

302
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:53,880
I know.

303
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,090
What do you mean?

304
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,040
Tell me.

305
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,480
Major Wumu ordered her

306
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,010
not to give any medication.

307
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,570
For what reason?

308
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,040
Well,

309
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,560
you'll have to ask him yourself.

310
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,160
Major Wumu will be back soon.

311
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:17,560
Yes.

312
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,160
Oshima Hao understood that Ye Biying

313
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,760
was trying to use Wumu's name

314
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,480
to defuse the current crisis

315
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,400
so the matter couldn't be investigated.

316
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,400
But what Ye Biying didn't know was

317
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,280
that Wumu was on his way back.

318
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,000
I've told you,

319
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,660
about this matter,

320
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,090
you need to ask the Major yourself.

321
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,520
Fine.

322
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:11,960
Calm down.

323
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,080
We'll do as you say.

324
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:23,280
I would like to invite Miss Ye

325
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,600
as an honored guest

326
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,880
to accompany me to headquarters.

327
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:29,890
Don't worry.

328
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,760
After we return from headquarters,

329
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,260
we'll release them immediately.

330
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,800
It's alright.

331
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:09,200
What are you doing?

332
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,200
Lieutenant Sakamoto, you've come at the right time.

333
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,800
Miss Ye and I were just discussing something.

334
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,360
Going to the headquarters?

335
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,360
Can you take us there?

336
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,240
Let's go.

337
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:03,880
Report.

338
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,160
Come in.

339
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,680
We're back.

340
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,140
Commander.

341
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,140
What happened?

342
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,600
I'm here to explain

343
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,040
sir.

344
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,780
Why are you speaking Chinese?

345
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,000
It's because

346
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,160
the key witness is here.

347
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,820
I need to make her understand.

348
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,280
Witness.

349
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:42,920
Yes.

350
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,120
Today we brought Tang Ju'er, a nurse from the hospital,

351
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,520
to the police station for questioning

352
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,280
because we discovered something suspicious.

353
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,560
Moreover,

354
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,400
the key witness to this matter is

355
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,560
right here,

356
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,480
Miss Ye Biying.

357
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,200
The patient taken away by Major Wumu

358
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:10,600
is also the important witness

359
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,170
in the palace investigation case.

360
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,480
He has been in the ward

361
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,800
under Tang Ju'er's care.

362
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,600
Reportedly, this patient,

363
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,520
besides injuries to his limbs,

364
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,240
also suffered severe trauma to his throat

365
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,730
and couldn't speak.

366
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,580
I asked the doctor,

367
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,640
and he had been prescribing

368
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:34,970
medication for throat treatment.

369
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:35,960
However,

370
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,720
we found in the ward

371
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,730
that many of these pills

372
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:45,560
hadn't been taken at all.

373
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,410
I suspect this witness is not Private Jiexin.

374
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,840
Jiexin might already be dead.

375
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,640
Miss Ye told me

376
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:02,840
that

377
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:06,960
Colonel Wumu ordered him not to eat.

378
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,780
I'd like to ask about this.

379
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,000
Why was that?

380
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:17,600
I told you before.

381
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,400
Miss Ye,

382
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,040
is this true?

383
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,120
Yes.

384
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:35,880
Report!

385
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,480
I'm back.

386
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,480
Miss Ye.

387
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,370
You should thank me.

388
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,480
For letting you

389
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,320
see Major Wumu so quickly.

390
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,000
Major.

391
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,520
You've come back just in time.

392
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,320
Let's get straight to the point.

393
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,480
You should know better than anyone.

394
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:25,800
Why didn't that so-called patient take the medicine?

395
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,840
Why was so much medicine left at the scene?

396
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,440
Please answer these questions.

397
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,200
Are you interrogating me?

398
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,120
Of course not.

399
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,040
Because this

400
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,880
is an unavoidable question.

401
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,480
Didn't Miss Ye tell you?

402
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,400
Of course she said so.

403
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,920
But I want to hear the real reason.

404
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,160
I told him.

405
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,240
Shut up.

406
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:04,080
Don't try to coordinate your stories in front of me.

407
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,220
Commander.

408
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,160
Here is Miss Ye's

409
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,220
signed statement.

410
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:19,650
Colonel.

411
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,540
Why didn't you give him the medicine?

412
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:23,640
Please answer me.

413
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,680
Perhaps the patient's condition

414
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,600
has improved,

415
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,880
so he doesn't need the medicine.

416
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:36,900
According to that statement,

417
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,800
he had been taking this medicine all along.

418
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,060
But from a few days ago,

419
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,570
the medication suddenly stopped.

420
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,400
That's strange.

421
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,410
However,

422
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,920
Tang Ju'er still prescribed the medicine for him.

423
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,840
It's possible that Nurse Tang was too nervous

424
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,120
and forgot.

425
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,140
She forgot.

426
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:03,020
But why weren't there any medicines in the ward?

427
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,930
And why were they found in the chamber pot?

428
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,200
Perhaps someone

429
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,330
didn't want him to take this medicine.

430
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,680
And why is that?

431
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,040
Colonel.

432
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,330
Please answer my question.

433
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,560
It was me.

434
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,240
Why?

435
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,490
Because I didn't want him to speak.

436
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,800
And why is that?

437
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,820
I don't need to explain myself to you.

438
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:52,400
You must tell me.

439
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,040
I think Commander Fujita wants to know too.

440
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,280
Commander, sir.

441
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,200
This man holds too many secrets.

442
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,000
You know that.

443
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,320
The secrets this man possesses

444
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:12,120
involve many dangerous people.

445
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,160
You also know.

446
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,640
Only by keeping him silent

447
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,860
can we safely get him off this island.

448
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,880
And take the secrets safely away from this island.

449
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,530
Has anyone bullied you?

450
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,160
I'm fine.

451
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,360
They arrested Tang Ju'er

452
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,000
and tortured her.

453
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,160
Where is Nurse Tang?

454
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,290
Colonel.

455
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:46,560
Maintaining order on the island

456
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,480
falls under the special police unit's jurisdiction.

457
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:52,360
I am currently interrogating Tang Ju'er.

458
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,930
Please don't interfere, Colonel.

459
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,420
I've already explained to you

460
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:59,170
the reasons for her arrest.

461
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,960
If you have no evidence,

462
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,180
I order you to release her now.

463
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,050
Alright,

464
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,730
let's end this matter here.

465
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,240
Sakamoto.

466
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:13,760
Please take Miss Ye home.

467
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:14,560
Yes, sir.

468
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:20,760
This way, please.

469
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,200
What about Ju'er?

470
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,530
He'll escort you out first.

471
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,010
Leave the rest to me.

472
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,140
She'll be fine.

473
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,040
Please.

474
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,600
Commander Fujita already knows

475
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,130
about everything that happened in Shanghai.

476
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,280
I now need to

477
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,800
provide an explanation to

478
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,800
the Imperial Palace Investigation Office in Tokyo.

479
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:15,880
Now I'll ask and you'll answer.

480
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,520
Why was my most important witness

481
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,360
attacked in Shanghai,

482
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,840
our occupied territory?

483
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,280
Before I left,

484
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,720
I only reported this matter

485
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,250
to Commander Fujita alone.

486
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,420
But as soon as we arrived in Shanghai,

487
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,160
Nationalist government agents

488
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,220
were following us.

489
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,410
They were waiting there all along.

490
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,640
We barely managed to shake them off.

491
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,080
But then we encountered Inoue Akira's men

492
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,340
who attacked us there.

493
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,600
Right in front of me,

494
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,960
before my very eyes,

495
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,090
my witness was killed in an explosion.

496
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,880
Give me an explanation.

497
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:53,560
Colonel,

498
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,560
your question is ridiculous.

499
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:01,080
I had no idea you had returned to the island.

500
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,680
The matter of leaving the island

501
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:08,280
was only communicated to Commander Fujita.

502
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,120
That means

503
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,480
it could only be the Commander's men

504
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,760
who leaked the secret.

505
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:12,800
Besides,

506
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:16,600
how could I possibly know

507
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,540
what Inoue Akira is doing?

508
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,280
This has nothing to do with us.

509
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,560
Inoue Akira's son, Inoue Kamakura,

510
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,040
is your most prized subordinate.

511
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,560
Your influence with his father

512
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,240
is probably greater than that of the Shanghai garrison commander.

513
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,680
Sawada Shigeto is going to be big.

514
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,040
I just want to know

515
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,200
who's so interested in my witness

516
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,960
that they'd not only silence him

517
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,640
but also destroy all evidence.

518
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:35,720
If you're so certain,

519
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,480
Colonel, you can request an audience with His Majesty

520
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,920
to report this matter.

521
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,880
Why rush back here

522
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,040
and accuse me without any evidence?

523
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,320
I don't understand.

524
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,000
I'm determined to catch

525
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,480
the real culprit behind the plane crash

526
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,320
and take them back to Tokyo

527
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,000
to face justice.

528
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:51,560
All right.

529
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,760
I think the Colonel

530
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,280
is being quite civil already.

531
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,480
You may leave now.

532
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,080
But Commander-

533
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,200
Out!

534
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,560
Excuse me.

535
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:06,520
Sir,

536
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,639
Fukuda and Chairman Tang from the Maintenance Association say

537
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,699
they have urgent matters to discuss.

538
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:13,449
Send them in.

539
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,320
What's going on here?

540
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,520
He's inciting the fishermen to cause trouble.

541
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:31,480
What?

542
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:33,840
Captain Daodao.

543
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:36,320
Now those villagers

544
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,800
aren't coming to get their fishing permits anymore.

545
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,080
I'm worried about tomorrow's fishing trip.

546
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,960
What nonsense are you talking about?

547
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:42,480
Get back there now

548
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,610
and get the job done.

549
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,060
Do you understand?

550
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,130
According to this list,

551
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,360
not a single person can be missing.

552
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,040
Got it?

553
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,320
Go back now.

554
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,800
What about my daughter?

555
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,639
Quickly notify them to release the person.

556
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,300
Look at this mess you've made.

557
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:59,480
Go now.

558
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,480
Thank you.

559
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:10,880
Captain Dashima.

560
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,280
I need a car.

561
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,480
I'll take my old one.

562
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,120
In half an hour,

563
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,720
please bring it to me.

564
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,880
Father.

565
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,840
Father.

566
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,360
Father.

567
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:12,480
Child.

568
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:15,760
Did they hurt you?

569
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,880
Laiju.

570
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:37,090
Stop crying. Let me help you change your clothes.

571
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,160
Don't cry.

572
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:52,880
No more tears.

573
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:06,480
Let me help you change your clothes.

574
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:24,520
Don't cry. Be happy, you're getting married.

575
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,480
Sister-in-law.

576
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,460
You've been through a lot.

577

Congratulations, sir.

580
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,400
Thank you,

581
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:10,680
everyone.

582
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,180
Ladies and gentlemen.

583
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:16,000
My son's wedding today is somewhat hasty.

584
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:17,920
The reason for this

585
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:21,000
is probably known to all of you.

586
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:23,280
The Tang family and the Ye family

587
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,700
have been engaged for a long time.

588
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,640
If not for the war on the island,

589
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,260
it wouldn't have been delayed until now.

590
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,480
Today,

591
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,480
these lovers have finally become husband and wife.

592
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,500
Thank you all for your blessings.

593
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:41,800
Thank you.

594
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:49,640
Since the wedding was arranged in haste,

595
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,520
we didn't have time to prepare a proper banquet.

596
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:54,320
Please forgive our negligence.

597
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:59,040
I will definitely prepare a special feast another day

598
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,160
to entertain everyone.

599
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,640
Please be understanding today.

600
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,520
No problem.

601
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:05,880
It's fine.

602
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:06,920
It's alright.

603
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:07,360
Sir.

604
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:07,960
Excuse us.

605
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,160
Let's go home for today.

606
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,820
Everyone, please go home now.

607
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:12,680
Let's go.

608
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,400
