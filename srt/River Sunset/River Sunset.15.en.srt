1
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,720
Major,

2
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,180
we just need to hold on until tomorrow night.

3
00:01:40,039 --> 00:01:40,800
Why?

4
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,160
Xia'er's uncle

5
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,800
will send people to the island tomorrow night.

6
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,479
By then,

7
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,680
we can get you off the island.

8
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,600
You've been in contact with the outside world all this time?

9
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,480
We've been using carrier pigeons to communicate.

10
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:02,560
Is it safe?

11
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,560
It's been safe so far.

12
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,320
Who is this uncle of Long Xia?

13
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:11,240
He's the leader of Anlan Hall.

14
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,680
Anlan Hall?

15
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,130
What kind of organization is that?

16
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,120
Anlan Hall

17
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,960
is what we call the Eight Districts Gang.

18
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,360
The Eight Districts Gang

19
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,920
originally referred to the 7th District

20
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:23,850
and 8th District

21
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,720
of Zhongshan County in the Macao Hometown Association.

22
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,720
The 7th District of Zhongshan County

23
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,250
is called Sanzao District.

24
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:31,480
The 8th District

25
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:33,610
is called Doumen District.

26
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,560
These two areas

27
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,720
are practically connected,

28
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,840
separated only by a sea trench.

29
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,200
That's why people in Macao

30
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,060
commonly refer to them as the Eight Districts Gang.

31
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,780
After the Japanese occupied the island,

32
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,720
some wealthy islanders fled to Macao.

33
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,200
But they all gathered at Anlan Hall.

34
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,520
So Anlan Hall

35
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,730
consists almost entirely of people from Zhongshan.

36
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,640
So can this leader be trusted?

37
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,540
The leader's name is Ye Zhaogeng.

38
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,400
He's my cousin.

39
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,260
We went to Hawaii together years ago.

40
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,520
We have a very deep bond.

41
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,760
After I stepped down as consul in Hawaii,

42
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,120
I handed over everything I established abroad,

43
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,240
including the Sanzao Association

44
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,100
and Anlan Hall,

45
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,520
to him to manage.

46
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,300
We used to be in close contact.

47
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,040
But after the Japanese came to the island,

48
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,700
almost all means of communication were cut off.

49
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,329
Carrier pigeons

50
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,960
are now our only way to communicate.

51
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:33,360
So he's very reliable.

52
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,410
Don't worry.

53
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,329
You didn't know any of this either?

54
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,400
She doesn't know.

55
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:44,480
We have a rule in our family.

56
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,000
This girl

57
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,400
can't be told about matters of the jianghu.

58
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,500
I'm not allowed to know anything.

59
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,720
Then tell me more about

60
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,680
this Anlan Hall.

61
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,760
Anlan Hall

62
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:57,600
in Macao's Sanzao Island Association

63
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,640
was actually founded by my father.

64
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,200
They are very united

65
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,660
but also quite exclusive.

66
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,680
Before,

67
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,720
they were just based in Macao

68
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,320
doing business with outsiders.

69
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,520
Later, gradually in Macau,

70
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,320
they became a powerful force.

71
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,000
Since the Japanese arrived on the island,

72
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,320
they've been massacring the local residents.

73
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,640
Many families from District 8

74
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:16,880
died in the massacre.

75
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:19,160
So Anlan Hall took the lead,

76
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,920
with Districts 7 and 8 of Macau

77
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,480
and even wealthy families worldwide providing funds.

78
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,720
They organized young people

79
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,120
to kill Japanese soldiers for revenge.

80
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,400
They specifically target

81
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,260
Japanese heads on Sanzao Island.

82
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,480
When I first arrived on the island,

83
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,720
Sasaki told me

84
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,360
that gangsters often come

85
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,800
to the island to cause trouble.

86
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,330
I guess he meant these guys.

87
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,800
But they're not gangsters.

88
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:43,920
These District 8 guys

89
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,400
have both money and power in Macau.

90
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,330
They have no need to bully the weak.

91
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,400
So they're different from the Macau thugs,

92
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,000
the actual Macau gangsters.

93
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,680
My father doesn't allow them to do evil things,

94
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,200
but they won't stand for being pushed around either.

95
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,280
When the Japanese carried out massacres on the island,

96
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:00,320
they became enemies with the Japanese there

97
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,240
and fought back with an eye for an eye.

98
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,280
A few years ago, in their biggest operation,

99
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,880
they secretly came to the island

100
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,280
and took out 12 Japanese soldiers in one go.

101
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,280
I understand.

102
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,480
A few days ago,

103
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,640
because the Japanese were searching too strictly,

104
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,960
my father originally

105
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,960
wanted them to sneak onto the island

106
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,600
to evacuate the Major.

107
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,480
This would ease my father's burden.

108
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,480
Once the Major reaches Macau,

109
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,560
he'll be safe.

110
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,090
We need to plan this carefully,

111
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,520
or it might backfire.

112
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,280
Ju'er is here.

113
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,240
Mrs. Si,

114
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,120
is Longxia here?

115
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,040
Yes,

116
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:50,520
he's discussing something with the master inside.

117
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,080
I'll go call him for you.

118
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,280
Hey.

119
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,720
I'll come back later.

120
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,240
Ju'er.

121
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,160
Go check.

122
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:02,880
I'll go see.

123
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,320
Who's Si Po?

124
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,480
It's Ju'er.

125
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,760
Ju'er?

126
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,600
I asked her to come in,

127
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,600
but she wouldn't.

128
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,760
She seemed strange to me.

129
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,010
Her clothes were dirty too.

130
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,360
I'll go check on her.

131
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,820
Please let my father know.

132
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,720
What's wrong, Ju'er?

133
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,000
It's okay, don't cry.

134
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,400
What's wrong? What happened?

135
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,000
Did someone bully you?

136
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,160
Why did you come here dressed like this?

137
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,520
They beat Huihui.

138
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:13,920
It's okay.

139
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,800
That Inoue Kamakura

140
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,480
keeps asking me about Ying'er.

141
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,280
But I don't know what's going on.

142
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:29,560
I only know the Japanese

143
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,880
are coming after you.

144
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,490
You and Ying'er are both in danger now.

145
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,760
Damn Japanese!

146
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,040
I won't let them get away with this.

147
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,040
Please don't be like this, I beg you.

148
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:40,920
I'm fine.

149
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,920
I'm really okay, don't be like this.

150
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,600
Don't go after them.

151
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,200
They'll kill you.

152
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,800
Ju'er.

153
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,080
I'm fine, I'm fine.

154
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,409
I'm not going anywhere.

155
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,480
Brother Longxia.

156
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,720
Let's leave this place.

157
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,680
I can't stand staying here another day.

158
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:12,800
Ju'er, my father always said

159
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,960
those who win people's hearts win the world.

160
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,400
The Japanese can't win our hearts.

161
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,520
They will never take our island.

162
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,240
We will leave this place someday.

163
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,040
I promise you.

164
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,840
I'll take you with me wherever I go.

165
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,720
Okay?

166
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,840
But not now.

167
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,460
Let's endure a little longer.

168
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,360
Ju'er.

169
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,679
No matter what happens,

170
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,460
I'll stay by your side.

171
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,260
Xia'er's uncle is very cautious in everything he does.

172
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:03,480
He must have planned everything carefully.

173
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,740
That's why he dared to send people to sneak onto the island.

174
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,720
Therefore,

175
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,520
we absolutely cannot miss this opportunity.

176
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,480
I agree.

177
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,680
I also think this is a good opportunity.

178
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,120
Mr. Ye,

179
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,800
this operation is outside my planned scope.

180
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,040
If we don't have

181
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,560
a clear understanding of the operation details

182
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,560
and don't develop a thorough plan,

183
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,480
accidents might happen.

184
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,340
Then discuss it again with the Major.

185
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,680
Every extra day we stay

186
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,800
means one more day of danger.

187
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,160
But I think

188
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,010
it's worth taking the risk.

189
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:43,840
Alright.

190
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,960
We'll go see the Major

191
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,680
and hear his opinion.

192
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,560
I'll take my leave now.

193
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:54,560
Alright.

194
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,940
I'll be out for a while.

195
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,800
Ju'er.

196
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,120
Ju'er.

197
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,480
Are you

198
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,220
still angry with your father?

199
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,220
It's that Inoue Kamakura who's inhuman.

200
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,640
Ju'er, don't worry.

201
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:18,040
I've already spoken with Translator Luo.

202
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,600
He'll find an opportunity

203
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,600
to speak to Commander Fujita

204
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,760
about reporting Inoue.

205
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,560
I'm getting old

206
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,760
and useless now.

207
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,480
I need to find a way

208
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,740
to find you someone to rely on.

209
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,160
Father.

210
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,240
Can you please

211
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,260
stop being the Japanese mouthpiece?

212
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,680
Do you know what

213
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,280
the villagers say about you?

214
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,360
I can't even hold

215
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,450
my head up in front of Brother Longxia.

216
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,680
Tell me the truth.

217
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,200
Are you still thinking about

218
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,360
that rascal Longxia?

219
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,090
Did you just go looking for him?

220
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,920
Yes, I did go to find him.

221
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:10,400
What's wrong?

222
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,200
I know what's on your mind.

223
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,480
But look at

224
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,680
the current situation of our Ye family.

225
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,760
You two can never be together.

226
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,880
Right now,

227
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,920
this island is under Japanese control.

228
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,240
Even our lives

229
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,400
are in the hands of the Japanese.

230
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,760
That has nothing to do with me.

231
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,200
How can you say that?

232
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,770
I've made up my mind.

233
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,800
I want to match you with Translator Luo.

234
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:46,400
I think this young man is quite good,

235
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,600
handsome and talented.

236
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,480
Besides,

237
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,400
he's in Commander Fujita's good graces,

238
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,360
and even the Japanese respect him.

239
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,960
You should give up that idea.

240
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,920
You're already a traitor.

241
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:04,560
Do you expect me to marry another traitor?

242
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,960
Say that again.

243
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,120
You are already a traitor.

244
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,240
Do you expect me

245
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,560
to marry another traitor?

246
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,240
I...

247
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,680
Go ahead, beat me to death.

248
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,360
I don't want to live anyway.

249
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,240
Your father's good intentions,

250
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,360
why can't you understand them?

251
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,920
I'll go make some food. You must be hungry.

252
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,800
You've been through a lot.

253
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,800
Ōshima Hiroshi has sealed off the village.

254
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:58,840
His purpose is to

255
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,040
separate the villagers from the Major.

256
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,800
No matter where the Major hides,

257
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,640
as long as he remains here,

258
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,800
he's not safe.

259
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,480
I still think he should go to Macau as soon as possible.

260
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,360
Let's discuss it after we see him.

261
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,160
Great!

262
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,840
Finally I can leave this hellhole.

263
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,880
These past few days here,

264
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,360
I've been like a rat in a trap.

265
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,330
When are we leaving?

266
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:07,920
I disagree.

267
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,740
I think this is a good opportunity

268
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,420
that we shouldn't pass up.

269
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,060
If they could sneak in safely,

270
00:15:19,520 --> 00:15:21,320
we should be able to get out safely too.

271
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:21,760
Yes.

272
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,040
My brother said that from Macau,

273
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:24,760
they've secretly landed on the island

274
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,560
several times,

275
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,800
even killed Japanese soldiers,

276
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:27,960
and never failed.

277
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,600
If we move the Major to Macau

278
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,080
and then transport him out from there,

279
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,080
wouldn't that be relatively safer?

280
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,380
If you don't want to leave,

281
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,000
I'll go by myself.

282
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,840
Can you even stand up?

283
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,160
Can you change your clothes?

284
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,490
Can you walk out of here?

285
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,080
Fine, if you can leave,

286
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:55,960
my mission is accomplished.

287
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,960
Go ahead.

288
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,720
Mr. Wumu,

289
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,400
if you disagree,

290
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,890
you should at least tell me why.

291
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,720
A safe evacuation route

292
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,160
requires a complete plan and detailed information.

293
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,920
There's only one such route.

294
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,060
Not enough.

295
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,680
On the way here,

296
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,960
the police squad has already blocked

297
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,320
all entrances to the village

298
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,280
to isolate him

299
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,360
and the villagers,

300
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,240
forcing him to come out.

301
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,280
If we try to leave now,

302
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:22,520
we'd be walking right into their trap.

303
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,360
Well done,

304
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,360
Major.

305
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,960
That's all

306
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,580
I can reveal to you.

307
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,960
Precisely because the Japanese have taken action,

308
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,800
this opportunity is even more precious.

309
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,040
If we don't leave,

310
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,520
it won't be long

311
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,160
before the Japanese search this place.

312
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,240
They'll burst in with an explosion

313
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,680
and carry out my bloody corpse.

314
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,400
Is that the outcome you want?

315
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,440
That's your scenario, not mine.

316
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,160
What I want is to take you

317
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,480
and the intelligence out together.

318
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,480
Do you understand?

319
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,120
So all you can do is wait

320
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,320
for my arrangements.

321
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,280
Is that clear?

322
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,720
There's no time.

323
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,800
For me,

324
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,480
seizing the moment

325
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,760
is more important than waiting for an opportunity.

326
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,600
Every extra day we stay here

327
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:04,760
adds more risk.

328
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:05,839
Executing this plan now

329
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,079
is the greatest risk.

330
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,520
If you're afraid,

331
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,800
you can stay behind.

332
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,160
I'll go alone.

333
00:17:22,359 --> 00:17:23,040
Miss Ye,

334
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,089
please ask your brother

335
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,079
to tell me the specific action plan

336
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,360
and contact information for the other party.

337
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,360
I'll go by myself.

338
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,480
If anything goes wrong,

339
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,480
you know

340
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,680
I'll keep the secret.

341
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:39,040
I hope you can contact the National Government as soon as possible

342
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,000
to arrange for the second Believer to come.

343
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,730
Don't speak.

344
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,040
Mr. Takeki.

345
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,640
I don't think you have the authority

346
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,400
to restrict my movements.

347
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,120
That depends on whether your actions

348
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,480
interfere with mine.

349
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,840
You're interfering with me right now.

350
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,120
Are you not understanding what I'm saying?

351
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,640
Are you in such a hurry to go out and die?

352
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,160
He's injured.

353
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,200
Don't get him so agitated, okay?

354
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,080
I'll go out first.

355
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:16,560
Miss Ye.

356
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,160
Could you please

357
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,560
reconsider this matter?

358
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,000
You should rest first.

359
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,480
Miss Ye.

360
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,720
Please

361
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,680
bring me more medicine as soon as possible.

362
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,450
I can't wait any longer.

363
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,810
My brothers are about to leave.

364
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,920
Fall in!

365
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,200
At ease.

366
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:45,840
Men,

367
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,800
I have good news and bad news.

368
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,040
The good news is

369
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:53,850
our training here is complete.

370
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,560
Tomorrow we'll fly to

371
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,200
Alameda Naval Air Station.

372
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,320
And we'll load our planes

373
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:03,480
onto the aircraft carrier Hornet.

374
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,570
That's where our real mission will begin.

375
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,240
Some modules are not yet complete.

376
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,320
The Navy will use small vessels

377
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,320
to transport them to the aircraft carrier

378
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,250
so we can complete assembly at sea.

379
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,640
The bad news is

380
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,520
not everyone can go.

381
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:23,960
The Hornet can only accommodate

382
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,120
15 to 16 planes.

383
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:28,920
This means that at least

384
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,920
four crew members will be left behind

385
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,780
to be reassigned by the military.

386
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,480
If it were up to me,

387
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,600
I would take all of you.

388
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,760
Because you not only volunteered for

389
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,880
this mission,

390
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,200
but have also proven yourselves

391
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,400
to be the best

392
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,530
and bravest pilots I've ever trained.

393
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,800
Each one of you

394
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:06,560
is extremely courageous and capable.

395
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:17,320
I'm proud of each and every one of you.

396
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,240
Lieutenant,

397
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,840
draw the lots.

398
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,200
Men,

399
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:37,960
let's begin the draw.

400
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,620
Blue means you're going to the fleet.

401
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,480
Red means you stay behind.

402
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,200
I'm sorry,

403
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,040
truly.

404
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,640
I know each of you

405
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,600
has committed fully to this mission.

406
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,840
Let's remember

407
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,320
the war needs good pilots.

408
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,640
As for the rest,

409
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,640
trust that the Army will make

410
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,160
good use of your skills.

411
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,000
Tomorrow everyone

412
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,060
will go to Alameda.

413
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,960
Those who aren't flying will help with loading,

414
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,680
then wait there for reassignment by the Army.

415
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,760
All right, boys.

416
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:31,840
Time to draw lots.

417
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,720
Let's go, young men.

418
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:01,600
Colonel.

419
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,080
What is this?

420
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,160
The form includes all mechanical

421
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,240
maintenance tasks.

422
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,680
The base requires you to give an overall assessment.

423
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,200
I don't have time

424
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,280
to sign your complicated paperwork.

425
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:12,120
Colonel, this is part of our job.

426
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:13,650
An evaluation is required.

427
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:14,760
Please.

428
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:17,720
Colonel Wright.

429
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,360
Alright.

430
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,280
Long-winded?

431
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:22,880
Colonel, I need you to clarify

432
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,080
which part of our work was long-winded,

433
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:26,520
Colonel.

434
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:15,690
When you go back,

435
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,760
have your father contact Macau immediately

436
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,960
to cancel tomorrow night's operation.

437
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,920
The Major's current physical condition

438
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:22,680
has caused him to lose

439
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,520
his objective and calm judgment of matters.

440
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,200
Acting rashly is too risky.

441
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,540
I firmly disagree.

442
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,340
Did you hear me?

443
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,760
Director, Commander Yuan is here to pick us up.

444
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,640
Director Shen.

445
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:33,100
Director Shen.

446
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:37,400
Commander of the Third Column, Fourth War Zone,

447
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,640
Yuan Dai, County Magistrate of Zhongshan,

448
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,120
ordered to welcome you.

449
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,080
Oh my!

450
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,170
Commander Yuan,

451
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,720
I've long admired your reputation.

452
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,120
Stop the sedan chair.

453
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,160
Wait.

454
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:48,820
Director Shen,

455
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,480
since Zhongshan County fell,

456
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,010
I've moved my headquarters

457
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,280
from Xinhui to Heshan.

458
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,080
Recently relocated to Shaping,

459
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:57,960
just ahead.

460
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,480
Please come and see it.

461
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,330
Sure, let's take a look.

462
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,280
Such an elite commander.

463
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,530
Thank you for your trouble.

464
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,520
First squad assembly complete.

465
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,840
Second squad assembly complete.

466
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:16,600
Fourth squad assembly complete.

467
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,120
Fifth squad assembly complete.

468
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,320
Seventh squad assembly complete.

469
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,180
Eighth squad assembly complete.

470
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,280
From now on.

471
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:29,360
Inoue, divide your men into four teams.

472
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:33,240
First to third teams will enter through the Tan family bay entrance.

473
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:35,400
Any villager who leaves

474
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,530
must be registered.

475
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,760
Any unusual situation with the villagers

476
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,490
must be reported immediately.

477
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,360
Five people from each of the three teams

478
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,840
bring your tools.

479
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,320
Starting today,

480
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:46,960
dig out all hidden underground

481
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:47,560
secret rooms, cellars, and false walls

482
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,960
search every household thoroughly.

483
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,920
Especially those

484
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,640
wealthy households on the island.

485
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,300
Make sure no corner is missed.

486
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,200
But captain,

487
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,530
we've already searched all these places.

488
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,640
Then search again.

489
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,240
Can you guarantee there are no fish that slipped through the net?

490
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,280
What about the fourth team?

491
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:04,080
I want 24-hour surveillance

492
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:04,800
on every move of the Ye family.

493
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,160
Report immediately if anything happens.

494
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:06,690
Yes, sir.

495
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,040
Sasaki.

496
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:09,520
Here.

497
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,240
Reserve the second platoon

498
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,920
to be ready for perimeter operations in the next two days.

499
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:17,720
Focus on the area starting from Tanjiawan Village,

500
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,520
search every mountain and village you encounter.

501
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,720
Especially those

502
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,200
abandoned villages and deserted graveyards.

503
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:25,730
Yes, sir.

504
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:26,720
Well,

505
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,490
let's begin the operation.

506
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,720
Inoue.

507
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:32,560
Yes?

508
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,730
You'll guard the entrance to Tanjiawan village.

509
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,480
If Ye Biying leaves

510
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,040
or if the Colonel enters Tanjiawan village

511
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,240
to contact Ye Biying,

512
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,220
report to me immediately.

513
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,360
Yes, sir.

514
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,480
Are you suspicious of Ye Biying

515
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,400
or our Colonel?

516
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,120
Stop asking unnecessary questions.

517
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,120
Go now.

518
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,380
Operation begins.

519
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,240
About face!

520
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,480
Forward march.

521
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,880
[Document box]

522
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:20,400
Are these all the files

523
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,360
on General Dajiao Censheng?

524
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:21,880
Yes.

525
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,120
These are all the files

526
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,320
after his plane crash in North Huangyang Mountain.

527
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,080
All the information is complete.

528
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,210
Everything's here.

529
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,010
Alright, I understand.

530
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,900
I'll take my leave.

531
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,250
Report, sir.

532
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:32,740
Come in.

533
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,680
The captain has made all arrangements.

534
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,640
Take these files.

535
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,050
We'll go to the garrison together.

536
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:47,480
Let's curry favor with that envoy from the palace.

537
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,320
Salute!

538
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:55,860
Please.

539
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:15,880
Oh my,

540
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,490
Commander Yuan.

541
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,660
This place of yours is quite nice.

542
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,320
This is Ming Dynasty architecture, isn't it?

543
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,920
Director Shen, you flatter me.

544
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,200
It's modest.

545
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,680
Please take the seat of honor.

546
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,480
May I sit?

547
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:33,760
Director Shen, now that you're here,

548
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,490
you must take the seat of honor.

549
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,530
Commander Yuan,

550
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,360
last year,

551
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,240
when you handed over the items

552
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,500
from Dajiao Chensheng's crashed plane,

553
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,320
the intelligence inside was extremely valuable.

554
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,640
I specifically

555
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,130
submitted a commendation report for you.

556
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,280
I have good news for you.

557
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,000
Don't point that gun at people.

558
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:05,400
Oh!

559
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,080
Director Shen,

560
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:06,810
I'm so sorry.

561
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,360
Sorry.

562
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,080
Before I left,

563
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:12,040
the higher-ups said they would reward you

564
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,700
with 100,000 silver dollars.

565
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,060
Thank you, Director Shen.

566
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:18,460
Thank you, Director Shen.

567
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:20,960
Tell me about

568
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,520
the current situation here.

569
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,040
Well,

570
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,060
don't even mention it.

571
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,880
All these coastal districts

572
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:31,620
have fallen into Japanese hands.

573
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,080
Where are our people?

574
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,080
This January,

575
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,600
I had the district chiefs

576
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,360
of districts one, two, and five,

577
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,920
take all their personnel

578
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,490
and secretly return to Zhongshan County.

579
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,760
I ordered them to

580
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,040
establish district governments behind enemy lines

581
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,370
and our party's special operations unit.

582
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,860
Which of our people is closest to Sanzao Island?

583
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,520
The closest to Sanzao Island

584
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:03,480
is Commander Liang Weihe's Provisional Seventh Detachment.

585
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,600
They've been operating in the Eighth District of Zhongshan.

586
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,800
The closest to Sanzao Island should be

587
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,880
the Second Battalion of the Seventh Detachment.

588
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,400
The battalion commander is Chen Zhongjian.

589
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,120
However,

590
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,560
This troop used to be

591
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:32,360
the 8th District Communist Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Unit.

592
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,120
Haven't they been incorporated now?

593
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,280
But don't worry.

594
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,360
The men under my command, Yuan's command,

595
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:40,800
I don't care if they're Communists

596
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,880
or Nationalists.

597
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,320
They must pass my test.

598
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,140
After declaring war on Japan,

599
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,760
the Fourth War Zone Command

600
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:51,400
reorganized all these

601
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,280
scattered Communist guerrilla units

602
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,280
into this Second Battalion.

603
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,940
After they assembled,

604
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,320
they've been operating separately in the 8th District.

605
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:01,180
Their location

606
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:03,130
is around Huangyang Mountain.

607
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,530
They're just separated from Sanzao Island by a sea channel.

608
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,210
Commander Yuan,

609
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:09,720
how many troops

610
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:12,000
do you have in total when fully assembled?

611
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,040
About a thousand men in total.

612
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,480
How long will it take to gather them?

613
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:18,960
My men are on standby.

614
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,480
Two days at most.

615
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,980
Are they easy to mobilize?

616
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,160
Yes, they are.

617
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:25,760
I'm here

618
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,820
to ask for your help with two matters.

619
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:28,960
First,

620
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,450
after some time,

621
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:33,360
I need you to accompany me to Huangyang Mountain.

622
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,800
I want to visit Dajiao Chensheng,

623
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,080
the plane crash site,

624
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,480
and survey the terrain.

625
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,660
In a couple of days,

626
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,480
some Japanese will arrive there.

627
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,000
I need you to organize your forces

628
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,400
to ambush them.

629
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,880
Ambush the Japanese?

630
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:46,920
Yes.

631
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,480
Director Shen,

632
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,320
is this intelligence

633
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,360
reliable?

634
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,530
I'll arrange it right away.

635
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,120
Second,

636
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,680
do you have someone under your command called

637
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,560
Wu Fazi?

638
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,400
What's his position?

639
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,480
He's from the 7th Training Battalion,

640
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,540
deputy commander.

641
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,360
Is he here

642
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:09,920
now?

643
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,360
Get him over here.

644
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,290
I need to see him.

645
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:12,890
Alright.

646
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,000
Yuan Ming.

647
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,280
Ride quickly

648
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,010
to the 7th Training Battalion.

649
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:22,160
Bring Deputy Captain Wu Fazi

650
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,560
to the headquarters.

651
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,040
Excuse me.

652
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,520
Sir.

653
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,480
The investigator from Tokyo

654
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:41,800
has established his investigation unit.

655
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,130
But the name is strange.

656
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:45,120
It's called the Sixth Aviation Base,

657
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,920
Freshwater Supply Investigation Headquarters.

658
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,360
A name is just a symbol.

659
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,080
How has the Special Police Unit

660
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,480
been doing these days?

661
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,820
Is Captain Oshima still looking for that American?

662
00:33:59,120 --> 00:33:59,680
Yes.

663
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:01,760
Captain Oshima seems convinced

664
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,920
that the American is hiding on the island,

665
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,080
so he sends out police squads every day

666
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,680
to search the entire island.

667
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,400
Stubborn fellow.

668
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,280
If it weren't for those damn hawks

669
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,739
provoking the Americans,

670
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,920
the Americans might not have come from so far away

671
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,480
to join such a war.

672
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,480
Yes,

673
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,480
you're right.

674
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,639
The hawk officers are gaining momentum now,

675
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:23,639
with victories throughout Southeast Asia.

676
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:24,639
It seems to prove that all the hawks' predictions

677
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:25,440
were correct.

678
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,020
But I believe this situation won't last.

679
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,600
When you fly over

680
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,239
America someday,

681
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,239
see how many chimneys are down there,

682
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:38,960
and you'll know you're wrong.

683
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,120
Everyone.

684
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,960
Does anyone here know

685
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,489
what the slogan of the Meiji Restoration was?

686
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:54,719
It was 'Revere the Emperor, Expel the Barbarians.'

687
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,600
Well said, Akino.

688
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,760
Loyalty to His Majesty the Emperor

689
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:01,840
is the most precious treasure

690
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,480
in each of your lives.

691
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,080
This is a top-secret investigation.

692
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,920
Before I announce your mission,

693
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,000
Akino.

694
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,920
I need you to lead everyone

695
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,960
in swearing to His Majesty

696
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,690
that you will keep this secret.

697
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,160
Take the oath!

698
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,000
Protect the Emperor!

699
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,600
Absolute loyalty!

700
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,360
Follow orders!

701
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,960
Keep secrets!

702
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,010
Let's begin.

703
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,970
General Ōsumi Mineo

704
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:40,280
His Imperial Majesty's military council advisor

705
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,560
He has served as

706
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,720
the Second Fleet Commander

707
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:48,960
and twice as the Minister of Navy.

708
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,890
His Imperial Majesty granted him the title of Baron.

709
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:53,760
He is also one of

710
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,690
the Emperor's closest ministers.

711
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:01,160
The day after the Manchurian Incident,

712
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,200
General Ōsumi clearly stated in the cabinet

713
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,840
that he supported the Southern Expansion Doctrine,

714
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:07,600
firmly advocating for launching the Pacific War

715
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,800
and declaring war on America and Britain.

716
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,600
General Ōsumi

717
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,080
is a leader greatly admired by our navy.

718
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:19,120
However, there are some people

719
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,760
who are dissatisfied with his position,

720
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,160
even furious,

721
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,920
and they decided

722
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,400
to take the most severe measures of revenge against General Ōsumi.

723
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,800
Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department has confirmed

724
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,800
that two instructors from the Marine Corps

725
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,460
training base were involved in this operation.

726
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,480
They are Teikichi Saji

727
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,120
and Ryukichi Ohashi.

728
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,760
One of them

729
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,120
poisoned the food at Uoya Restaurant,

730
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,580
which General Daikaku frequently visited.

731
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:45,400
The other one

732
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,480
planted a bomb in General Daikaku's car,

733
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,520
killing

734
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,200
his driver and secretary.

735
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,560
Fortunately,

736
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,680
General Daikaku survived both assassination attempts.

737
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,120
However, in February last year,

738
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:03,560
by order of His Majesty the Emperor,

739
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,240
General Daikaku

740
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,800
came to inspect the China theater

741
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,060
as an Imperial Headquarters inspector.

742
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,820
His plane suddenly crashed at Huangyang Mountain nearby,

743
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,560
killing him

744
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,690
under mysterious circumstances.

745
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,600
You don't need to know any more details.

746
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,970
You only need to know one thing.

747
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:25,560
[Sheng Junhai]

748
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:27,360
His Majesty the Emperor is

749
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:28,720
extremely angry about this matter.

750
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:30,000
That's why he sent me

751
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,280
here to investigate and uncover the truth.

752
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,140
[Sheng Junhai]

753
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,280
The special police force on the island

754
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,040
is controlled by the hawks.

755
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,800
I don't trust them.

756
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,080
So yesterday,

757
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:44,080
Commander Fujita and I decided

758
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,200
to deploy our bravest anti-aircraft artillery unit

759
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:49,080
to assist with my investigation.

760
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,330
Is everyone clear about what needs to be done?

761
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:05,920
Hasegawa.

762
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,850
This letter is from your hometown.

763
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,520
Your brother cares about you.

764
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,850
You have a good brother.

765
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:26,120
Thank you for your trouble, Captain Oshima.

766
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:28,720
No need for formalities.

767
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,000
Alright.

768
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,480
May I call you Mr. Oshima?

769
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,160
Yes.

770
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,080
Captain Oshima,

771
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,840
your instructions, please.

772
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,180
It's like this.

773
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,080
That Chinese woman

774
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,720
brought by the Colonel, have you seen her?

775
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,380
Yes, I have.

776
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,040
As soon as she appears at the airport barracks looking for the Colonel,

777
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,240
report to me by telephone immediately.

778
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,040
Also,

779
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,920
if the Colonel goes out to find her,

780
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,780
you must report that to me as well.

781
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,000
Yes, sir.

782
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,530
I'm counting on you.

783
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:04,720
I'm sorry.

784
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,160
The Colonel is holding an emergency meeting.

785
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,620
No one is allowed to enter.

786
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,780
I have important documents here.

787
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,640
Then please wait for a while.

788
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:14,490
[Set]

789
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,300
[Check]

790
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:16,600
[Box]

791
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:17,060
[Check]

792
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:17,640
[Set]

793
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,680
We need to go to Huangyang Mountain

794
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,840
to the crash site of General Dajiao Censheng

795
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,570
for an on-site investigation.

796
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,040
Captain Akino,

797
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,400
please prepare a detailed plan

798
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,760
to submit to Commander Fujita,

799
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,000
and notify the patrol boat unit

800
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,920
to fully support our operation.

801
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,170
Colonel.

802
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,560
Captain Oshima,

803
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,090
what brings you here today?

804
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:49,480
Can we talk inside?

805
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:50,840
Sure,

806
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:51,920
come on in.

807
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,410
Take a break.

808
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:54,080
Yes, sir.

809
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,500
Captain Oshima

810
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,680
What brings you here?

811
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,080
Colonel, today actually

812
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,480
Sasaki

813
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,400
We heard that you came to this island

814
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,360
because of General Dajiao's case

815
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:06,690
We immediately retrieved all the case files from that time.

816
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,920
I've just arrived here

817
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,400
and don't have much information yet.

818
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,330
Thank you for bringing these to me.

819
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,120
Colonel

820
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,800
About what happened in the past

821
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,520
please forgive us.

822
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:25,840
Oh

823
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,840
it's fine.

824
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,200
As long as you don't doubt my identity as an investigator

825
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,600
that's all that matters.

826
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,400
Of course

827
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,200
I wouldn't dare doubt someone sent by the Emperor.

828
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:35,840
By the way

829
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,480
that Chinese woman you brought with you

830
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:42,520
makes us a bit uneasy.

831
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,960
To be honest

832
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,040
Chinese people can't be trusted.

833
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:45,840
Really?

834
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,440
I don't feel that way.

835
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:50,700
Perhaps you haven't seen a beautiful woman in too long?

836
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,320
You and I are both fighting to win this holy war.

837
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,120
There's no conflict between us.

838
00:40:58,560 --> 00:40:59,240
I'm really glad

839
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,300
you think that way.

840
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:00,960
Thank you.

841
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:02,480
So

842
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,890
let's have dinner together today.

843
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:06,160
I'm sorry

844
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,080
I've already promised to host

845
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,080
the officers from the anti-aircraft unit tonight.

846
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:10,640
Another time.

847
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,000
I'll treat you another day.

848
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:12,880
I understand.

849
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,520
I'll take my leave then.

850
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:23,120
What is Oshima Hiroshi's true purpose

851
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,280
this time?

852
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,400
Japanese soldiers are everywhere outside today.

853
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:29,920
Mother-in-law,

854
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:30,720
I understand.

855
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:32,880
There are Japanese soldiers

856
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:34,280
at Caotang Mountain too.

857
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,200
But I need to check on

858
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,260
Major White first.

859
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,280
Is that okay?

860
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,340
I'll act according to the situation.

861
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,680
Father.

862
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,330
Where are you going?

863
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:44,480
I...

864
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,120
I'm going to see Major White.

865
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,120
There are so many Japanese soldiers outside.

866
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,280
Why don't you think before you act?

867
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,800
But his injuries...

868
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,060
I'm worried about him.

869
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,480
I didn't say you couldn't go.

870
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,120
What do you mean?

871
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,680
Qingming Festival is coming soon.

872
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,760
No matter how arrogant these Japanese are,

873
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,960
they can't stop us from paying respects to our ancestors.

874
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,280
What I mean is,

875
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,480
I'll go with you.

876
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,820
You're always the clever one.
