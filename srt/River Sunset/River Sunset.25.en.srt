1
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,039
Colonel,

2
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,000
how should we report to Commander Fujita

3
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,759
about this?

4
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,380
This is the largest battle

5
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:00,880
my squadron has fought

6
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:05,040
since joining the war.

7
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,759
Although

8
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,200
we suffered some casualties,

9
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,700
we successfully repelled the enemy,

10
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,560
protected your safety,

11
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,800
and successfully completed

12
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,060
the re-investigation of the crash site.

13
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,079
Commander Fujita should reward

14
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,600
our squadron for the brave performance

15
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,600
in this battle.

16
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,079
I think you two

17
00:02:58,079 --> 00:02:59,520
look better in uniform.

18
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,320
Let's go to headquarters first.

19
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,720
Is it possible that they

20
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,560
were prepared in advance?

21
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,000
I've considered that possibility before.

22
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,560
But if

23
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,160
they were already lying in wait there,

24
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,320
why would they

25
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,400
open fire

26
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:28,000
before we even arrived at the scene?

27
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,160
However, Commander,

28
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,240
Thanks to Captain Oshima

29
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,040
who arrived with his men in time,

30
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,560
otherwise, the consequences would have been unthinkable.

31
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,360
How did Oshima Hiroshi know

32
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,920
that you would be attacked?

33
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,200
About that,

34
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,380
I'm not entirely sure myself.

35
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,970
By the way, regarding the investigation.

36
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,320
I shall take my leave now

37
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,329
and wait for the Major outside.

38
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,860
Isn't that the Colonel's car?

39
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,640
Is the Colonel at headquarters too?

40
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,640
I'm afraid so.

41
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,960
Wait outside for a moment.

42
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,090
I'll go in by myself.

43
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,000
To be honest, Commander,

44
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,840
since Captain Oshima returned to the island,

45
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,840
he's been suspicious

46
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,320
of my female assistant's identity.

47
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,080
He has repeatedly warned me

48
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,200
and often sends people

49
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,960
to follow Miss Ye Biying and me.

50
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,120
Is that so?

51
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,040
His suspicions are excessive.

52
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,280
Has this caused you any trouble?

53
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,720
I wouldn't call it trouble.

54
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,960
But I don't like

55
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:51,620
the feeling of being watched.

56
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,840
This is outrageous.

57
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,840
By all rights,

58
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,480
he knows I came to the island

59
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,480
to investigate General Daijiao Minuo's plane crash,

60
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,840
and he should

61
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,260
fully cooperate with my investigation.

62
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:03,640
This guy

63
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,440
has been acting strange lately.

64
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,760
But maybe I'm overthinking it.

65
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,560
I've heard that Captain Daishima

66
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,160
is someone who does things his own way.

67
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,890
He has no interest in politics.

68
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,600
Besides,

69
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,800
when General Okaku Minao's plane crashed,

70
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,000
he wasn't even on the island.

71
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:17,720
No.

72
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,320
He left Sanzao Island

73
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,450
only after General Okaku's accident.

74
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,560
But Captain Oshima told me personally.

75
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,580
What did he say?

76
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,120
Nothing.

77
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,060
I might have remembered it wrong.

78
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,920
Is Commander Fujita in?

79
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,640
Yes, please wait.

80
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,840
Captain Oshima.

81
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,480
Deputy Sakamoto.

82
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,280
Why are you dressed like this today?

83
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,320
Does it still fit?

84
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,320
I need to see the commander about something today.

85
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,520
But right now the commander

86
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,560
is listening to the colonel's report

87
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,840
about yesterday's battle at Huangyang Mountain.

88
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,720
I see.

89
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,000
Please come in.

90
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,640
No need.

91
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,920
It's not necessary.

92
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,120
I'll head back first.

93
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,280
Are you sure?

94
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,920
I'm quite busy today.

95
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,880
I'll visit another time.

96
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:34,920
Let's go.

97
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,240
Back to the airport camp first.

98
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,000
Okay.

99
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,880
Did you call for me, sir?

100
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:47,360
Has the Colonel left?

101
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,300
Yes, he has.

102
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,980
Captain Oshima was just here.

103
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,960
He mentioned some urgent mission

104
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:55,320
and left in a hurry.

105
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,200
Always rushing around.

106
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,600
Who knows what he's up to.

107
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,600
Arrange for the base intelligence unit

108
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:03,920
to secretly investigate Oshima Hiroshi.

109
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,480
We must clarify this man's

110
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:06,400
connection with high-ranking officers

111
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,120
of the domestic control faction.

112
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,480
I must rule out his involvement

113
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,140
in the assassination of General Kakusuminari.

114
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,760
This investigation

115
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,720
is to be classified as top secret.

116
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,360
I understand.

117
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,460
I'll take my leave now.

118
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,120
This small boat belongs to Futian Fuda Company.

119
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,520
They often use this boat

120
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,980
to purchase supplies in Macau and Hong Kong.

121
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,040
Inoue.

122
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,560
You can go back now.

123
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,960
We'll be back in two or three days at most.

124
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,080
Keep the team in order while we're gone.

125
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:12,960
Don't worry.

126
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,520
Oshima.

127
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,760
Take the car back first.

128
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,080
I have some matters to attend to.

129
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:15,760
Mitchell.

130
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,080
I need a favor from you.

131
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,120
What is it?

132
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,200
I need pilots for the No. 16 aircraft.

133
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,120
Thank you.

134
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,520
I'd like to keep your Lieutenant Miller

135
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,760
for this operation.

136
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,040
Although he's one of my Navy pilots,

137
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,880
he's also participated in joint operations with the Army.

138
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,080
It's your call, Jimmy.

139
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:36,840
Miller.

140
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:39,960
How are our Army pilots doing?

141
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,960
Can they become qualified sailors?

142
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,160
Almost there, sir.

143
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,560
If my carrier can't provide

144
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,680
a 49-knot wind condition,

145
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,840
can they take off?

146
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,520
Even if we sail against the wind?

147
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,720
We also need 150 yards to take off.

148
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,640
Including the 16th aircraft,

149
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,200
we still have 160 yards of runway left.

150
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,000
So, sir,

151
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,840
no problem.

152
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,080
When would you like me to demonstrate takeoff?

153
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,320
I don't think a demonstration is necessary.

154
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,600
I need you to stay

155
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,920
and work with us.

156
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:17,680
Captain,

157
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,400
the Navy won't demote me

158
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,200
for joining an Army mission, will they?

159
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,080
If this mission succeeds,

160
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,760
they'll promote you.

161
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,880
Miller became the last pilot

162
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,280
to join the Doolittle Raiders mission.

163
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,640
Years later,

164
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,840
Mitchell's joke came true.

165
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:39,080
He was promoted to Rear Admiral.

166
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:44,000
You really need to try this ice cream.

167
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,000
We've been aboard the Hornet

168
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,280
for a day now.

169
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,770
If everything goes as planned,

170
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,560
we'll take off on the 19th

171
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:04,240
to demonstrate our operation to the Navy.

172
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,680
Alright.

173
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,060
Sir, we're taking off on the 19th?

174
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:09,720
Where to?

175
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,880
I can't tell you that yet.

176
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:12,560
Sir,

177
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,050
everyone wants to know the secret.

178
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,840
Could you give us a hint?

179
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,920
Is it Japan or the Philippines?

180
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,960
You only need to focus on two things right now.

181
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,240
Keeping our planes

182
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,600
in combat-ready condition.

183
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,560
And learning.

184
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,480
Learning?

185
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:28,600
Yes.

186
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,080
I've invited two Navy colleagues

187
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,480
to be your instructors.

188
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,680
Lieutenant Colonel, Major, please come over.

189
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,840
Major Stephen Jurika,

190
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,840
from 1939 to 1941,

191
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:47,120
served as the Naval Attaché at our embassy in Japan.

192
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,200
He's an expert on Japan.

193
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,840
He will explain Japan's history,

194
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:55,290
political ideology and culture to us.

195
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,920
This doesn't mean we're going to Japan.

196
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:02,120
This is to help you better understand

197
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,560
our enemy.

198
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,680
To defeat your enemy,

199
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,930
you must first understand him.

200
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,400
Colonel Apollo Sossec,

201
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,480
executive officer of the Hornet,

202
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,960
he has been to China many times.

203
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,080
He will teach you some basic Chinese

204
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:25,560
so we can communicate with our allies there.

205
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,290
This could save your lives.

206
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,600
Colonel, please.

207
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,480
I am American.

208
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,080
That's 'I am American' in Chinese.

209
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:38,840
Cole,

210
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,000
you try it.

211
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,960
I am American.

212
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,960
Did you understand what he said?

213
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,240
I'm sure you did.

214
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,480
I think we can handle this.

215
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,200
I am American.

216
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,600
Fukuda.

217
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,680
Mr. Inoue,

218
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,720
why are you so free today

219
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,600
to come visit me?

220
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,720
Quickly get me some drinks and women.

221
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,480
Drinks and women.

222
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,800
Go prepare the drinks now.

223
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,280
Right.

224
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:34,720
And women,

225
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,920
who can come over now?

226
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,400
We'll arrange it right away.

227
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,080
Hurry up!

228
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:40,560
Get her over here immediately.

229
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,880
Hurry up and get ready.

230
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,360
Hurry up!

231
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,760
Bring me wine and food.

232
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,800
Quick!

233
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,760
Mr. Inoue,

234
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,600
you look very happy today.

235
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,400
That's right.

236
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,920
Of course.

237
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:19,920
The captain and Sasaki have left.

238
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,720
Now nobody can control me on this island.

239
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,040
That's wonderful.

240
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:23,880
So you already knew?

241
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:24,480
I know about this.

242
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,240
They took my boat.

243
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,400
Oh, right.

244
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,480
Mr. Fukuda,

245
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,680
you seem exhausted.

246
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,360
I've been dead tired lately too.

247
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,200
You don't know,

248
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,560
that Oshima guy,

249
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,920
I don't know what's gotten into him,

250
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,320
but he's becoming more and more active now.

251
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,640
That missing soldier from the garrison,

252
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,280
has he still not been found?

253
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,080
I guess that guy

254
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,000
was taken by those gangsters from Macau,

255
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,400
or he encountered

256
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,130
someone he shouldn't have met.

257
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,880
Let's drop this matter.

258
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,120
Get me women now.

259
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,400
Women?

260
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,360
I'll arrange that right away.

261
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,520
Hurry up and find women for me.

262
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,280
Is everything ready?

263
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,330
Yes, it's ready.

264
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:03,480
All prepared.

265
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:03,880
Yes.

266
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:06,800
Captain Inoue, this way please.

267
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,640
I'm going up.

268
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,130
Please enjoy yourself.

269
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,640
Long time no see.

270
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,880
Don't be like that.

271
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,740
Come over here.

272
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,360
Let's

273
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,160
have a drink together.

274
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:09,760
Come on.

275
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:12,920
Come on.

276
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,040
Come here.

277
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,720
Come here.

278
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:39,690
Your skin looks so nice.

279
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,240
So clean

280
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,960
and glowing.

281
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,120
Don't worry.

282
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,090
I'm different from others.

283
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,480
Do you know

284
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,320
what I want to do?

285
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,640
I want

286
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,560
your skin.

287
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,280
Alright.

288
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,560
I should start cutting from here

289
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,400
all the way to here.

290
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,800
This way,

291
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,240
I should be able to completely

292
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,720
peel off your skin.

293
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:26,839
And

294
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,960
it won't damage

295
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,800
the integrity of the front.

296
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,000
You know what?

297
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,600
By then,

298
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,280
you'll still be alive.

299
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,480
Ouch!

300
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,480
It hurts so much!

301
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,240
Let go of me!

302
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:46,280
Let go of me right now!

303
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:47,280
Ouch!

304
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:48,880
Futian!

305
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,640
Futian, come quickly!

306
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,720
It's killing me!

307
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:51,200
Futian, pull her away!

308
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,480
You crazy woman!

309
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,280
You bitch!

310
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,050
What's going on?

311
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:04,760
Damn

312
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,920
you!

313
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,280
Please calm down.

314
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,410
Your arm is injured.

315
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,730
Go to the hospital quickly.

316
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,720
Your arm is bleeding.

317
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,080
Go to the hospital now.

318
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,000
Wait for me to come back.

319
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,800
It hurts so much!

320
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:20,680
Futian!

321
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,320
Coming!

322
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,480
Keep an eye on her.

323
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,480
Ouch!

324
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,680
Be gentle.

325
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,040
What happened to you?

326
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,400
I ran into a mad dog.

327
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:07,160
I must kill her.

328
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,760
Nurse Tang,

329
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,640
come here and dress his wound.

330
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,100
I'll go get some medicine.

331
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,080
Tang Ju'er.

332
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,160
Tang Ju'er.

333
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,680
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

334
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,760
Let go of me.

335
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,260
This is a hospital.

336
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,200
Trust me.

337
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,760
Captain Jingshang,

338
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,120
take this medicine three times a day,

339
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,690
two pills each time.

340
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,080
Ouch!

341
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:50,600
Ouch!

342
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,960
Be gentle!

343
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,880
You need to come back tomorrow to change the dressing.

344
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,280
Don't let it get infected.

345
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,000
I know.

346
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,780
Hurry up with the bandage.

347
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,000
It's not serious.

348
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,530
Just a shot and some medicine, you'll be fine.

349
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,680
Do it quickly.

350
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:08,760
Hey there.

351
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,700
Didn't sleep well?

352
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,120
When did you get here?

353
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:49,480
I've been here for a while.

354
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,080
Sitting here the whole time.

355
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:53,720
I didn't just arrive.

356
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,120
What's wrong?

357
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,450
Something on your mind?

358
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,040
No.

359
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:01,680
Come with me to the hospital.

360
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,080
Let's check on the Major.

361
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,400
I want to see Ju'er too.

362
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,000
Then get your things ready.

363
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,260
I'll wait for you here.

364
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,200
How's your hand?

365
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,360
Is it healing at all?

366
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:41,360
Not really.

367
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,080
Ouch!

368
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,880
Ow!

369
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:50,900
You're acting.

370
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,610
Go ahead, keep pretending.

371
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:55,220
Let me see how serious your injury really is.

372
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,080
Stop it.

373
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,480
Be serious.

374
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,720
I need to tell you something important.

375
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:08,000
Yesterday when I went to Huangyang Mountain,

376
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,660
someone sneaked into my room.

377
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,580
Did you lose anything?

378
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,520
Nothing was stolen,

379
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,600
but all my suitcases were searched.

380
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,480
Who could it be?

381
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,880
Daodao Hao?

382
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,330
Besides Daodao Hao,

383
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,560
we should be more vigilant about

384
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,480
another pair of invisible eyes.

385
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:33,010
Is there anything we can do?

386
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:35,000
I do have a solution,

387
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,960
but I need your cooperation.

388
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,480
No problem, tell me.

389
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,640
Move in with me.

390
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,040
Where did you go?

391
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,260
What are you doing?

392
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,480
I'm sorry.

393
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:44,320
Go away.

394
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,200
I'm coming, Jimmy.

395
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,120
Weit.

396
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,480
Weit.

397
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,180
What's wrong with you?

398
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,130
Are you feeling unwell somewhere?

399
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,560
It's nothing.

400
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,320
It's nothing.

401
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,940
I just dreamed that

402
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:56,280
Wu Mu, Miss Ye, and I

403
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,800
were surrounded by the Japanese.

404
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,160
It's alright.

405
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,920
They'll be here soon.

406
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,920
Let's take your medicine first.

407
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,040
I've been in the hospital for several days.

408
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,920
I wonder how Mr. Ye's family

409
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,200
has been doing lately.

410
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,240
If you have a chance,

411
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,320
please thank them for me,

412
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,280
would you?

413
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,360
Nurse Tang.

414
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,000
What is it?

415
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:41,920
Nothing.

416
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,040
Of course.

417
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,060
I'm also very grateful for your care.

418
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,360
I pray to God every day

419
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,480
that the war will end soon.

420
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:52,920
So you all can live

421
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,760
happy and peaceful lives.

422
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,800
I thought I could be happy too.

423
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,960
Now it's impossible.

424
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,920
What's wrong?

425
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,040
Put your hands where I can see them.

426
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,600
Now!

427
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:35,960
You know,

428
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,720
it's really strange.

429
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,760
Our police squad

430
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,480
searched the entire island several times,

431
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,280
but couldn't find you anywhere.

432
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:47,360
Never thought you would hide

433
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,040
in our hospital to recover.

434
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,160
Quite a clever hideout.

435
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:55,960
Darling.

436
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,560
You just mentioned

437
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,480
someone is coming later?

438
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,840
It's alright.

439
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,320
Let's wait together.

440
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,400
Darling.

441
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:11,680
Draw the curtains.

442
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,240
Don't let anyone outside

443
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:15,900
see what's happening in here.

444
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:35,760
Good child,

445
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,360
come here.

446
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,160
Darling.

447
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,300
You've finally fallen into my hands.

448
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,360
I won't let you go this time.

449
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,360
Don't hurt her.

450
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:54,280
Shut up.

451
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,480
This is not your choice.

452
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,040
Be careful!

453
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,720
If any of you dares to make a sound,

454
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,480
I'll shoot immediately.

455
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,080
I'll turn her pretty face

456
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,920
into a bloody mess.

457
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:12,960
All right.

458
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:17,040
Now let's act as normal.

459
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,480
Put it down.

460
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:23,480
Stay quiet.

461
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,920
I'm so delighted

462
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,480
to meet you, Colonel.

463
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,000
Put your sword over there.

464
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,060
Lieutenant Inoue,

465
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,520
we can talk about this.

466
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,650
What is there to talk about?

467
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,360
You palace scum.

468
00:32:55,520 --> 00:32:57,040
I really hate people

469
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,680
who cause me trouble.

470
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,240
I should wipe all of you out.

471
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,530
Pretty lady,

472
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,640
throw your bag over here.

473
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,080
Give it to him.

474
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,480
No more weapons, right?

475
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,960
No weapons, none at all.

476
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:34,840
The truth has finally come to light.

477
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,680
All our problems are solved.

478
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,200
Colonel,

479
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,280
how did you manage to get such a beautiful lady

480
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,600
in your custody?

481
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,400
No wonder

482
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,800
our captain kept suspecting

483
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:59,040
something was wrong with this.

484
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,480
Tang Ju'er.

485
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,520
Don't worry,

486
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,280
I'll take you to the comfort station later.

487
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,400
You can keep company with

488
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,840
that little girl called Huihui.

489
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:15,760
Or maybe

490
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,600
the three of us can have fun together later.

491
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:19,400
You beast!

492
00:34:20,679 --> 00:34:21,360
Yes.

493
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,280
You're right.

494
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,280
Raise your hands.

495
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,560
Put your hands up.

496
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,679
Raise them.

497
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:33,960
You raise yours too.

498
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,020
Don't fall asleep.

499
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,290
There's one more thing.

500
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,480
You all recognize this, right?

501
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:49,239
Can anyone tell me

502
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,840
what this is used for?

503
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:59,640
What is this?

504
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,530
Look at your reactions.

505
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,480
Of course I know

506
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:13,400
what this is for.

507
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:15,640
You won't talk now, huh?

508
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,040
That's fine.

509
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:19,480
When we get back to the police station,

510
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,410
you'll have plenty of time to talk.

511
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,760
The patient in bed 8 is almost recovered.

512
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,960
The one in bed 2 still needs observation.

513
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,200
So all the examinations are done for today?

514
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,360
Yes.

515
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,720
Xiao Zhen.

516
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:05,970
Who's there?

517
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,880
Did someone call me?

518
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,640
Nurse Tang,

519
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,480
what can I do for you?

520
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:21,480
Nurse Tang,

521
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,010
is something wrong?

522
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:24,800
Nurse Tang?

523
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,240
Nurse Tang?

524
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,200
Nurse Tang?

525
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:37,880
It's nothing.

526
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,760
I was just changing his bandage

527
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,120
and hurt him a bit.

528
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,140
Well, please be more careful.

529
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:02,880
Ju'er.

530
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,240
Ju'er.

531
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:05,960
It's okay.

532
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:09,840
Calm down.

533
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,000
What should we do now?

534
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:26,960
It's fine.

535
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,250
Everything's okay.

536
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,320
Don't worry.

537
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:54,280
Chinese cabbage for sale! Come and buy!

538
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:01,920
I've arrived.

539
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,080
Alright, take care.

540
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,020
Although he was my classmate,

541
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,700
he's now become a colonel.

542
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:14,240
I'm not as successful as he is.

543
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,800
It's been a long time, Mr. Oshima.

544
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,680
What a rare visitor you are.

545
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,240
What's wrong?

546
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,840
Lieutenant Yamaguchi Kyuji is from Saga.

547
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,480
He was originally assigned to the 23rd Army in Hong Kong.

548
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,400
He's from the Special Police Force.

549
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,760
A lieutenant officer.

550
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:59,080
I transferred him here because he can be trusted.

551
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:04,400
Hello.

552
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,560
It's an honor.

553
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,880
This is my subordinate, Sasaki.

554
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:11,520
Pleased to meet you.

555
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:12,880
Hello.

556
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,920
What's troubling you, Mr. Oshima?

557
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,720
From the Imperial Palace's chamberlain office,

558
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,850
they've sent a colonel investigator.

559
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,680
His name is Takeki Ichiro.

560
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,320
He's investigating

561
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,980
last year's plane crash of General Osumi Minao.

562
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,760
Someone from the Imperial Guard Division.

563
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,640
Then just cooperate with him.

564
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,700
Is there a problem?

565
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,920
Could General Osumi's plane crash

566
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,560
have some connection to you, Mr. Oshima?

567
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:44,040
It's not like that.

568
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,320
It's just that

569
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,130
this person has many suspicious aspects,

570
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,320
yet it's impossible to verify or investigate them.

571
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,020
Is there anything else that can't be investigated?

572
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,580
This man is the Emperor's special envoy.

573
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,480
His documents

574
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,600
bear His Imperial Majesty's personal signature.

575
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:01,720
Not just me,

576
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,920
the captain of the Special Police Unit.

577
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,120
Even Commander Fujita

578
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,040
fears him.

579
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,760
Have you verified

580
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,760
the authenticity of this document?

581
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,760
How could I verify it?

582
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,920
If we only have telegrams,

583
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:20,200
we can't verify his identity.

584
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,120
The only way is

585
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:26,600
to send a telegram to someone close to him

586
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:29,040
or to His Majesty himself.

587
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:32,800
That's quite troublesome indeed.

588
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,360
Sir,

589
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,840
dinner is ready.

590
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,100
Let's eat first

591
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,160
and talk while we eat.

592
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,680
That sounds good.

593
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,810
Let's eat first.

594
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,400
This way, please.

595
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,620
That's enough.

596
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:25,760
Please, go ahead.

597
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,280
Thank you.

598
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,280
Don't mention it.

599
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,380
Let me fill your glass.

600
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,320
How many years has it been since we last met?

601
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:40,680
Here's to you.

602
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:41,480
Cheers.

603
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,360
It's my honor.

604
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,400
Please eat.

605
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,500
Help yourself.

606
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:58,640
Don't be shy.

607
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:03,080
I want to know

608
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,080
how many spy networks former Prime Minister Konoe Fumimaro

609
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:05,880
still maintains in Japan and China,

610
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,920
even after his resignation.

611
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,840
Why do you ask?

612
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,560
The only thing I can confirm now

613
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:13,800
is that Colonel Takeki

614
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:17,880
graduated from Shanghai Tongwen College

615
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:22,760
and is likely a protégé of former Prime Minister Konoe.

616
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:24,160
I see.

617
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,840
Prime Minister Konoe's investigation agency

618
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:29,320
belongs to the Cabinet Intelligence Bureau.
