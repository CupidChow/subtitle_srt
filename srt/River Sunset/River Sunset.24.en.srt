1
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,520
I agree.

2
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,720
I agree.

3
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,240
Come on.

4
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,680
Eat

5
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,880
It's so messy today.

6
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,840
What happened?

7
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,440
I heard someone died, right?

8
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,720
The Marine Defense Brigade

9
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,960
many people died.

10
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:09,889
The commander went there himself.

11
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,720
Wait for Ju.

12
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,900
I'll tell you when she comes back.

13
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,800
Interpreter Luo.

14
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:16,960
I told you

15
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,840
I told you last time.

16
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,320
I told you?

17
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:24,360
The Commander did receive a report

18
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,400
about lifting the sea ban.

19
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,640
But...

20
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,720
He left it in the safe.

21
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,920
I can't see it.

22
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,320
It's almost time.

23
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,400
Do you think people on the island

24
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,160
should go out or not?

25
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,120
I think you worry too much.

26
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,400
It's good to lift the sea ban.

27
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:43,920
You can

28
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,250
just mobilize everyone to sail normally.

29
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:48,940
Why don't you find a chance

30
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,240
to read the report?

31
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:53,360
It's not that I don't want to read it.

32
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,400
Let’s put it aside.

33
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,640
If Commander knows about this,

34
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,680
I’ll be beheaded.

35
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,240
I said,

36
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,000
If I can see it, I'll say it. Okay.

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:00,960
You're talking.

38
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,040
How can I not watch it?

39
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:04,920
Let's drink.

40
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,000
Let's stop here. Let's drink.

41
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,680
Come on.

42
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,160
Ju!

43
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,640
Is Major doing well at the hospital?

44
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,450
Nothing went wrong, right?

45
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,760
Oshima Hao came once.

46
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,740
It was a close call.

47
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,260
I was so scared that my legs were weak.

48
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,290
I didn't expect that

49
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,600
you did well.

50
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:42,210
Brother Dragonfly.

51
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,280
You seldom praise me.

52
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,480
I'll praise you more.

53
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:50,400
Brother Dragonfly.

54
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,520
I think

55
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,560
you've been nice to me lately.

56
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,680
I don't know

57
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,800
Is it because

58
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,080
what I did for you and Ying-ah?

59
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,360
what I did for you and Ying Er?

60
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,640
You and Ying Er...

61
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,880
When we were young,

62
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,040
I played every day.

63
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,600
Playing house.

64
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,360
Give birth to a fat doll next year.

65
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,400
Kneel.

66
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,280
First bow to heaven and earth.

67
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,640
What's the second bow?

68
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:35,840
Whatever. Bow to each other.

69
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,360
Play house.

70
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,320
Give birth to a fat doll next year.

71
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,480
and play house with your wife.

72
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:49,400
Give birth to a fat doll next year.

73
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,360
Give it to me.

74
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,360
Let go!

75
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,720
Let go of me!

76
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,520
Let go!

77
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:56,960
Give it to me.

78
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,600
Gosh.

79
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,970
I'll count to three.

80
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,560
Look at that.

81
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,520
What's that?

82
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,480
Look.

83
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,970
Look over there.

84
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,160
I remember.

85
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,760
It was great when I was young.

86
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,360
I was carefree every day.

87
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,480
I only know how to play games.

88
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,520
To me,

89
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,920
it's not just a game.

90
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,880
Since I was young,

91
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,720
I've decided

92
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,610
I'll only marry you.

93
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,320
I, Tang Ju Er, belong to you.

94
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,760
I'll go wherever you go.

95
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,320
I'll do whatever you tell me to do.

96
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,280
I'll never regret it.

97
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,960
Actually, what worries me the most

98
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,080
is that silly girl, Ju.

99
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,280
She is honest.

100
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,160
She doesn't know how to protect herself.

101
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,880
I'm old.

102
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,720
I can't protect her.

103
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,080
Although

104
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,560
she works in a Japanese hospital,

105
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,480
But the Japanese don't like her.

106
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,360
The Chinese on the island

107
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,600
are pointing at me behind my back.

108
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,200
As a girl,

109
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:41,800
I think

110
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:44,280
we should live a peaceful life.

111
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,880
It's none of your business.

112
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,400
Right?

113
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,720
However,

114
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,720
I saw Ju

115
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,480
with Young Master Ye.

116
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,760
Are you talking about Ye Long Hero?

117
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,360
I see.

118
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,400
I

119
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,960
I went to the island late.

120
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,320
So I don't know

121
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,520
about some things.

122
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,120
I heard that

123
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:11,000
Ju is engaged to Dragon Hero Ye.

124
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,280
Don't mention the Ye family.

125
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,240
That's it?

126
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,000
I didn't agree at all.

127
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,240
The Ye family

128
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,200
didn't give any betrothal gifts.

129
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:31,920
It's just a fortune teller.

130
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,080
When the Japanese came to the island,

131
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:34,920
Lord Ye

132
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,960
doesn't mention the truth.

133
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,040
It's like

134
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,940
the Tang family wants to be a good match for them.

135
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,720
With Ju'er's condition,

136
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,000
many youngsters

137
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,560
to fawn on her.

138
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,800
Interpreter Na.

139
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Zhipong.

140
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,840
In troubled times,

141
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,280
I

142
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,040
I don't care about being old-fashioned.

143
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,560
In terms of age,

144
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,000
I'm older than you.

145
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,680
Let me ask you something.

146
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,080
Can I

147
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,400
entrust Ju to you?

148
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:15,800
Don't.

149
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,160
This...

150
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,360
Zhimong is just over the age of standing.

151
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:20,560
He has nothing.

152
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,960
I'm a bit out of my league.

153
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,160
What do you mean?

154
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,920
About the engagement,

155
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,600
about the engagement.

156
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,360
Zhiyong,

157
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:39,000
You and Ju are a perfect match.

158
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,400
They're a perfect match.

159
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,919
Come on let's drink

160
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:48,880
Pour it

161
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,600
Don't let me do it.

162
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,260
Let me do it.

163
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,480
Okay.

164
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,040
That's it.

165
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,140
This is for you.

166
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,960
Granny gave it to me.

167
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,160
It's for safety.

168
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,560
You believe this?

169
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,130
Aren't the Eight Army invincible?

170
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,610
Does it work?

171
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,080
If you are sincere, it will work.

172
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:46,680
Alright.

173
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,080
Hang it here.

174
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,280
Keep everyone safe.

175
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,680
It's good to keep everyone safe.

176
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,760
Bye.

177
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,360
Sir.

178
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,360
Come in.

179
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,080
Sir.

180
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:45,640
This is Colonel's telephone.

181
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,160
We plan to re-inspect

182
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,890
the crash scene of Huangyang Mountain tomorrow.

183
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,480
Ichiro Takemugi.

184
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,240
There's no problem with this telegram.

185
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,240
No.

186
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,600
This is

187
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,560
to the attendant room in Tokyo.

188
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,880
A work telephone that reports movements.

189
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,760
Gosh.

190
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:07,760
The only possibility

191
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:09,520
is a telegram.

192
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,600
If it's intercepted,

193
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,680
it may cause

194
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,000
the battle at Mount Huangyang today.

195
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,960
what you can think of

196
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,720
Our Colonel Takemichi

197
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,480
I knew it.

198
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,530
The well.

199
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,880
Close the door. Okay.

200
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,320
Sasaki!

201
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,920
Show us what you've got.

202
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,640
This is...

203
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,920
In Colonel's luggage,

204
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,180
in Colonel’s luggage.

205
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,680
And a pen reserver.

206
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,800
There's a micro film inside.

207
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,000
Toothpowder box contains secret ink.

208
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,920
In the small bottle,

209
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,480
of secret communication.

210
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,080
and the key to the lock.

211
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,600
And...

212
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,400
Here.

213
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,520
A round pillar micro password machine.

214
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,040
These are

215
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,720
the most advanced spies.

216
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,320
Could this colonel

217
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,960
a spy?

218
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:24,800
What is the black box

219
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,280
in this photo?

220
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,920
I asked the intelligence class.

221
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:29,760
This is

222
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,520
a micro camera film.

223
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,720
hidden box storage.

224
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,400
Here.

225
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,400
What's a snail-like thing?

226
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,080
This thing is called

227
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,000
Chicago Reincarnable Spy Gun.

228
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,930
You can shoot four bullets in a row.

229
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,840
It's a senior investigator.

230
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:49,520
or a senior spy.

231
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,450
The last weapon for self-defense.

232
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,840
The Cabinet investigation room is really...

233
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,770
There are a lot of advanced things.

234
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:58,720
Yes

235
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,720
The thing I'm most interested in

236
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,840
is the secret-written tool Colonel brought.

237
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:04,560
Apart from our radio station,

238
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,720
through our radio station,

239
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:07,760
I don't think

240
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,560
the second communication channel.

241
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,600
Then...

242
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,840
the major investigation

243
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,520
of the landcraft incident,

244
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,560
I think he'll use secret potions

245
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,920
in one place.

246
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,530
According to our observation,

247
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,680
Colonel carried

248
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,480
a notebook.

249
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,520
I never leave it

250
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,960
Is that so?

251
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:32,960
What else?

252
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,840
Captain Oshima Hao sent someone to the telecom room.

253
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,360
Roger that.

254
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,520
the electricity to Tokyo.

255
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,080
What did you do?

256
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,400
They asked

257
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,640
not to alarm you.

258
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,840
and learn about Colonel’s telephone.

259
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,120
I gave it to them.

260
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,560
Okay.

261
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:52,800
I'll find a chance

262
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,730
I'll find a chance to figure it out.

263
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,240
I will be loyal to the Emperor,

264
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,920
or offend the investigators in the palace.

265
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:00,880
However,

266
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,000
Don’t be silly.

267
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,760
to be the sacrifices

268
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,360
for the officers' struggle.

269
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,560
You may leave.

270
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,720
Thank you.

271
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,360
Captain.

272
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,480
What do you think?

273
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,400
What's the relationship

274
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,280
What's his relationship with Colonel?

275
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,640
Captain.

276
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,280
Do you suspect

277
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:54,880
is the spy of Jiang Zheng Quan's army?

278
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,640
Base Camp and the Emperor

279
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,720
the fall of General Daikok.

280
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,080
I suspect some officers are involved.

281
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:06,400
This is inevitable.

282
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,480
A investigator needs to use a special method

283
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,480
to get some evidence.

284
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,920
in a secret way.

285
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:10,840
So...

286
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,600
With these spy tools,

287
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,130
We can't conclude that yet.

288
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,280
I think so.

289
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,340
A senior officer of the close guards.

290
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,040
How could he be Jiang Zheng Quan's commander?

291
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:28,360
This is unbelievable.

292
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:05,480
Another uninvited guest came in.

293
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:08,680
Are you from Oshima or Fujita?

294
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,280
Should we investigate

295
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:21,480
to Colonel Takemichi?

296
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:26,160
Are you going to announce the declaration of war

297
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,240
the Emperor sent?

298
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,520
Could it be...

299
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,120
Sasaki found something big.

300
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,480
Can't we investigate in public?

301
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,240
Use your brain.

302
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,960
Use wisdom.

303
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:38,520
Although we found

304
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,380
many spy tools,

305
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,000
But I'm afraid

306
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,460
we need to do it ourselves.

307
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,400
In other words,

308
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,800
You mean

309
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:53,080
we haven't grasped the key point?

310
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,560
What's the problem, Colonel Takemichi?

311
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,080
This time,

312
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,960
along the way.

313
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,480
Did the real problem

314
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:06,319
Is it solved?

315
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,160
We don't know.

316
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,240
what the real purpose

317
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,880
What is it?

318
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:18,690
That's what I'm talking about.

319
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,819
He went to Mount Huangyang

320
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,800
Isn't he going to re-investigate

321
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,680
of the Major Shogun's crash again?

322
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,980
I don't think that's the purpose.

323
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,100
When they were on the move,

324
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,980
I sent Sasaki to the dock to check.

325
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:35,760
The number of people

326
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:39,520
The number of people left was correct.

327
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,760
I didn't expect that.

328
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,120
So you suspect

329
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,840
Captain.

330
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,120
Will Colonel take this opportunity

331
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,040
to take that American out?

332
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:51,840
But

333
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,280
he didn't take anyone with him.

334
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,480
What is he going to Mount Huangyang for?

335
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:03,040
I think there's only one reason

336
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:03,970
for one purpose.

337
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:05,840
Did he escape

338
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,160
with that attack?

339
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:08,840
and leave the Chinese lover behind.

340
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:09,840
and run away?

341
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,760
Your analysis makes no sense.

342
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,400
Besides,

343
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,240
if Colonel Takeishi wants to leave Sankuma,

344
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,120
he has all the conditions.

345
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,560
As long as he wants to leave,

346
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,000
all his procedures are normal.

347
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,720
It's complete.

348
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,480
No one can stop him.

349
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:34,000
Then why did he go to Mount Hwangyang?

350
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,720
Well...

351
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,680
I'm not sure.

352
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:48,240
what Colonel is really after.

353
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:50,640
We need to

354
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:57,240
analyze carefully.

355
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,400
Is there something

356
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,040
to deliver?

357
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,320
So we created

358
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,320
such a battle.

359
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:14,000
That's also a possibility.

360
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,560
Your analysis

361
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,160
has a point.

362
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,520
Something is fishy

363
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,280
is a bit strange.

364
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,860
It has something to do with the Americans

365
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,600
that we haven't found.

366
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,720
It's possible.

367
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:32,320
We can't decide yet.

368
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,480
If we can

369
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,040
into the opponent's mind,

370
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,320
I miss him.

371
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,240
What did I say?

372
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,160
Think from his perspective.

373
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,720
In this way,

374
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,960
analyze the opponent's mind.

375
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,680
That's right.

376
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,160
If we can do this,

377
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,930
we can see through each other's moves.

378
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,680
Then you can do it.

379
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:09,600
know yourself and your enemy.

380
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:14,980
Only you two

381
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,680
know this.

382
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,440
The investigation on Colonel

383
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,900
can only be done secretly.

384
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,640
Don’t leak it under any circumstances.

385
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:34,840
Colonel.

386
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,440
Are you okay?

387
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,930
Captain Oshima!

388
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,160
What are you doing here?

389
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:43,000
Commander ordered me to come.

390
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:46,960
Thanks to you,

391
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,600
we sent Captain Oshima here in advance

392
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,240
to avoid more casualties.

393
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,400
I didn't send him.

394
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,560
Oshima-ho's sinister

395
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:02,880
is beyond Takemichi's expectation.

396
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,720
He knows.

397
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,720
the next step

398
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,200
about the next step.

399
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,240
If something goes wrong,

400
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,960
or slight negligence,

401
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,200
The experienced Oshima Ho

402
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,600
won't miss this opportunity.

403
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:20,400
He'll force himself to give himself away.

404
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,120
Irigami.

405
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,680
Sasaki and I

406
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,000
to Macau tomorrow.

407
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,480
Many things are related to Macau.

408
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,280
Today in Mount Huangyang,

409
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:35,080
I met in Macau.

410
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,960
Two smugglers are also from Macau.

411
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,760
Can we kill two birds with one stone?

412
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,080
The key is in Macau.

413
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,520
We should go.

414
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,600
I see.

415
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:49,120
What about the team?

416
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:52,080
You'll be in charge of the team.

417
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,080
But...

418
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,360
Don't mess with Colonel Takemichi.

419
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,200
You're no match for him.

420
00:21:59,920 --> 00:22:02,960
Be careful.

421
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,320
Sasaki.

422
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,760
Inform Fukuda.

423
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,280
We'll use their ship tomorrow.

424
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:11,920
Also,

425
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:12,960
go to the telecom room

426
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,090
Tell Colonel Rongze

427
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,360
After noon tomorrow,

428
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,840
we'll visit him.

429
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:18,920
Sasaki.

430
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,120
You did a good job.

431
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,320
Go home and rest.

432
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:26,800
Okay?

433
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,680
Irigami.

434
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,240
Irigami.

435
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,040
Come here.

436
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,000
You've been very rude lately.

437
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,480
That's why

438
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,280
because of this.

439
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,960
How many times do I have to tell you?

440
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,960
How many people will surpass you?

441
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:22,000
Always drinking and playing with women.

442
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,880
You weren't like this before.

443
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,520
You used to work for me.

444
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:29,040
Look at you now.

445
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,080
Why are you laughing?

446
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,960
What's wrong?

447
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,600
We're talking about this again.

448
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,560
What we face

449
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,480
a tough man.

450
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,200
strong and brave.

451
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,140
He is meticulous and meticulous.

452
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,040
and meticulous.

453
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,240
You look

454
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,320
like this,

455
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,320
you can't deal with him.

456
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,180
I'm worried about you.

457
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,800
Did you hear that?

458
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,360
Did you hear that?

459
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:21,040
Get out.

460
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,480
Why are you so drunk again?

461
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:07,600
You went to see that jerk again, right?

462
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,860
How many times have I told you?

463
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:23,040
Don't always be cold-hearted.

464
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,760
Aren't you ashamed?

465
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,600
I'm engaged to Brother Dragon Hero.

466
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,080
An engagement?

467
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,240
She doesn't want you anymore.

468
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,840
In this world,

469
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,880
I'm the one who cares about you the most.

470
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,640
is your father.

471
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,680
This Dragon Hero

472
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,040
is up to all day.

473
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:51,960
No.

474
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,880
I have to find him.

475
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,010
Where are you going?

476
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,240
I'm going to find him.

477
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,600
Stay here.

478
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,240
Are you really going?

479
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:42,920
Who is it?

480
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,280
It's Chairman Tang.

481
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,280
Granny.

482
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,360
Granny.

483
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:04,400
Where is Lord De?

484
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,600
Bingchen.

485
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,600
Lord De.

486
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,040
It's late.

487
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,240
What is it?

488
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,540
Let's talk inside.

489
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,640
No need.

490
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,280
Say it.

491
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:35,560
Okay.

492
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,840
I might as well

493
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,320
make it clear.

494
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,480
Just say it.

495
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,240
The Tang family and Ye family

496
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,480
should be settled.

497
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:49,800
What do you mean?

498
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:53,320
The engagement between Ju and Xia

499
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,360
has long been canceled.

500
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,480
Count me in.

501
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,130
I'm not good enough for you.

502
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,040
Mr. De,

503
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,680
I'm here today to invite you

504
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,640
to discipline your son.

505
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,920
and let Ju go.

506
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,640
and leave her alone.

507
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:07,640
Chairman Tang.

508
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,970
What do you mean by that?

509
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,840
You think I don't know?

510
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,120
You kept pestering

511
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,480
over and over again.

512
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,320
and let her follow you.

513
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,800
to do those risky things.

514
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,530
Have you ever thought about it?

515
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,040
What will happen

516
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,360
what will happen?

517
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,000
Ju might die.

518
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,000
You like working for the Japanese.

519
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:29,720
I don't care.

520
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,880
It's none of my business.

521
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,080
But you don't know

522
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,240
between me and Ju.

523
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,120
Don't stay here.

524
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:34,760
Shut up!

525
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,280
Byung-chen.

526
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,000
Is there any misunderstanding?

527
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,960
Ju and Xia

528
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,680
grew up together.

529
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:50,160
I treat Ju

530
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,960
as my own daughter.

531
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:53,360
Lord De.

532
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,560
We can't afford

533
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,400
can't afford it.

534
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,480
I beg you.

535
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:03,320
Even if you pity me,

536
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,000
I'm old.

537
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,160
Unlike you,

538
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,640
You have a big family,

539
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,520
and have so many children.

540
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,400
I'm not as tough as you.

541
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,800
I only have Ju.

542
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:18,240
Miss.

543
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,720
You call her the pearl of the palm,

544
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,320
right?

545
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:21,920
Ju

546
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,800
is also my daughter.

547
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,400
I want to hold her in my hands.

548
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,480
But I'm afraid I can't hold her.

549
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,240
Ju is my only child.

550
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,560
She's my sweetheart.

551
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,560
If something happens to her,

552
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,000
what should I do?

553
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:36,840
Byung-chen.

554
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,320
No one wants to hurt Ju.

555
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,240
No one.

556
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,520
Lord De.

557
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:48,760
Who is the boss on this island now?

558
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:50,200
Is it up to you?

559
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,560
Am I the boss?

560
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,080
That's up to the Japanese.

561
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,840
We've been lowering

562
00:30:58,840 --> 00:30:59,920
and nod.

563
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,720
What do we want?

564
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,280
We just want to take a breath

565
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:03,920
and live?

566
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,880
I hope

567
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,680
my Ju and I

568
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,280
can live

569
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,920
a peaceful life.

570
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,360
Unlike your Dragon Hero,

571
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:13,280
He's so hot-tempered.

572
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,540
You still want to work with the Japanese?

573
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,680
You overestimate yourself.

574
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:18,960
Mr. Tang.

575
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,680
He's not an animal.

576
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,320
We should have dignity.

577
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,800
A beast. Xia.

578
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,410
Who are you calling a beast?

579
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,640
I don't understand.

580
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,480
I'm not talking about you.

581
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,480
Why do you take it on yourself?

582
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,280
I've admired those

583
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,200
heroes.

584
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,080
My dad taught me

585
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,160
a good man.

586
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,480
you have to sacrifice yourself for the country.

587
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,280
Even Ju knows these things.

588
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,720
As her father,

589
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,600
as a father?

590
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,480
Xia.

591
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:47,840
Fine.

592
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,560
I'm asking for trouble.

593
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,280
I came here

594
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,600
A young man

595
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,240
a young man.

596
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,520
You

597
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,840
be your hero.

598
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,360
No one will stop you.

599
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,120
But don't drag Ju

600
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,720
to be your scapegoat.

601
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,600
Who treats her as a scapegoat?

602
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,760
Who do you think I am?

603
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,080
If you are a good man,

604
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,200
don't let

605
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,200
to worry about you.

606
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,040
I won't look for her anymore.

607
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:15,520
Okay?

608
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,040
You said it.

609
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,280
I said it.

610
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,120
You?

611
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,650
I will never go to her again.

612
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,680
Please leave.

613
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,880
Let go!

614
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,640
Stop!

615
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:37,320
If you want to be a good man,

616
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,120
to be a good man,

617
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,840
Then you have to keep your word.

618
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,600
Byung-chen.

619
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,200
The kids are all grown up.

620
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:48,940
They have their own ideas.

621
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,480
As parents,

622
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,760
should stay out of it.

623
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,500
Let them go by themselves.

624
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,000
Say no more.

625
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:58,680
You go your way.

626
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,800
I'll go my own log bridge.

627
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:02,250
The Tang family.

628
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,400
Ye family.

629
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,600
We're even now.

630
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,160
And you, Dragon Hero.

631
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,360
Remember what you said.

632
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,000
Mr. De,

633
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,240
From now on,

634
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,960
we'll take care of our own children.

635
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:19,200
Wait.

636
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,360
Why are you so impulsive?

637
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,400
No matter what,

638
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,240
he's Ju's father.

639
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,880
Put it over here.

640
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:46,040
Load it up.

641
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:25,720
Let's go.

642
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:33,000
Bro, can I put my bag on it?

643
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,040
Help yourself.

644
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,560
Army pilot.

645
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,880
How many plates have been hung up?

646
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,400
Sir.

647
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,730
The deck is almost full.

648
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,080
I think we can get another one.

649
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,120
If we can do it again,

650
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:56,600
Jimmy.

651
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,480
you don't have enough space

652
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:58,640
to take off on the deck.

653
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,120
Sir.

654
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,800
We can't take off in such a short distance.

655
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:01,530
Lieutenant.

656
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:02,880
How far do you think

657
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,640
to the end of the runway?

658
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:07,840
It looks about 250.

659
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:08,840
If we install another plane,

660
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:10,880
it will be 230.

661
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:15,080
and use extra strengths on the boat.

662
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,080
It's possible.

663
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,520
When the ship passes the waves,

664
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,760
we can try

665
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,040
with the extra strengths of the boat.

666
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,800
Do you think you can do it?

667
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,040
Yes, sir.

668
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:27,520
If so,

669
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,640
200 is enough.

670
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,340
If that's the case,

671
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,880
200 is enough.

672
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:37,560
Those who taught us...

673
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,120
the Navy.

674
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,120
Then you can

675
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,280
the 16th flight to the navigator.

676
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:45,880
Yes, sir.

677
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,960
Yes, sir.

678
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:48,880
Sir.

679
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,480
Flight 16 is ready.

680
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,960
Continue to hang up.

681
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,410
Lieutenant Colonel, this way.

682
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:08,600
Captain Michell

683
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,880
to you.

684
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:11,920
He's so nice.

685
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:13,560
I can't accept it!

686
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,840
This is the captain's order.

687
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,480
Sir.

688
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:16,680
Everyone on this big bee

689
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,480
is under the captain's command.

690
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:01,120
Lieutenant Colonel Dulitt.

691
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,640
General Arnod ordered the colonel

692
00:38:03,640 --> 00:38:05,640
to get off the boat immediately.

693
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:09,840
Answer the emergency call from Washington.

694
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,880
Is General Arnod going to change his mind?

695
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:13,960
You have to answer the phone.

696
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:14,880
Let's drive slower.

697
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,000
and wait for you.

698
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,080
General.

699
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,480
Do you regret it?

700
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,480
The bee has set sail.

701
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,540
I can't go back to Washington.

702
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,080
Who wants to take you back?

703
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,040
Du Lite.

704
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,600
Who are you?

705
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:44,800
Marchel.

706
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,360
George Katrot Marchel

707
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,080
Dulitt.

708
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:49,240
How is your mission now?

709
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,720
General Mahye.

710
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,280
Sir.

711
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,480
I'm sorry.

712
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,200
I thought General Arnod

713
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:55,240
changed his mind

714
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,920
He doesn't allow me to lead this mission.

715
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,000
Du Lite.

716
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,400
I haven't told you.

717
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,360
Good luck.

718
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,280
How can I

719
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,400
let you go?

720
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,890
Sorry, General, I misunderstood.

721
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:05,960
Du Lite.

722
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:06,680
There are two things

723
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,280
I have to tell you right away.

724
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,200
First,

725
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,880
After the bombing,

726
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,320
to the Soviet Union.

727
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,040
[Plan]

728
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:14,970
of Vladivostok.

729
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:15,960
A few minutes ago,

730
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,320
a few minutes ago.

731
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:18,920
Got it.

732
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:20,560
Soviet Union and Japan

733
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,600
with Japan.

734
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,240
and failed to

735
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,040
to solve this problem.

736
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,080
Therefore, the Yizhou Airport is the only airport

737
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,360
you can land.

738
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:29,480
The Japanese

739
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,680
has been rampant in this area.

740
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,680
It's set for 20 days in China.

741
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,680
The deadline for your arrival

742
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,760
Yes, sir.

743
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,280
Second,

744
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:41,320
to your men.

745
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,320
This attack

746
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,000
you don’t have the chance

747
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,040
The probability of pilots survival

748
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:47,400
is less than 50 percent.

749
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,080
Got it.

750
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,720
Jimmy.

751
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,000
Please pretend that

752
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,400
Good luck.

753
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,400
I hope I can see you

754
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,400
in Washington soon.

755
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,400
Sir.

756
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,760
We promise to complete the mission.

757
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,250
Take me back to the ship.

758
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,040
Activate No. 1.

759
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,600
I order!

760
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,960
From now on,

761
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:27,680
Stay silent.

762
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,600
The communication between each ship

763
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,040
You can only use lantern and flag language.

764
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:37,000
Heavy Ocean ship, copy.

765
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,920
Light Ocean ship, Nashveil received.

766
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:45,000
Venice received.

767
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:50,360
Copy that.

768
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:56,760
Melledia, copy.

769
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:02,400
Monson received.

770
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:08,280
Greyson received.

771
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:13,120
Roger that.

772
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:22,480
Early 2 April 1942

773
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:26,440
The 18th Special Forces left the ArAmida Army
