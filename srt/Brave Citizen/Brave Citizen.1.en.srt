00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:54,520
Cuties of Mooyoung High,
have a good day!

5
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:55,780
Get over here!

6
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:57,510
EXEMPLARY ANTI-BULLYNG SCHOOL

7
00:00:57,010 --> 00:00:58,290
This is Mooyoung High

8
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:02,160
An Exemplary Anti-Bullying School
for two years straight.

9
00:01:13,026 --> 00:01:17,396
On the outside, it looks peaceful
and everyone even seems happy.

10
00:01:29,975 --> 00:01:31,375
So dope, boss.

11
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:37,050
But even here, darkness exists.

12
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:38,770
- Su-kang, hi!
- Nice catch!

13
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,800
- Good job.
- Out of the way!

14
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:43,670
Don't get Su-kang's way!
Piss off!

15
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,760
EDUCATION FOR HAPPINESS OF ALL

16
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,810
- Doesn't hurt?
- That's good!

17
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:53,820
Look at him.

18
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:58,760
Violence unfolds subtly,
away from people's gaze.

19
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,300
Wake him up,
I want another go.

20
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,800
Moron, piss off!

21
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:11,800
Kimbap's here!

22
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:13,820
Let's eat!

23
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:20,950
Violence occurs ruthlessly
right in front of everyone...

24
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:22,690
So fucking fun.

25
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,470
Rock, paper, scissors.

26
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,110
Rock, paper, scissors.

27
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,570
He's being a little bitch!

28
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,870
- Rock, paper, scissors.
- Something else, man.

29
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,070
Rock, paper, scissors.

30
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,740
Never played rock, paper, scissors?

31
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,320
Don't frown, man.

32
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:37,870
It's like someone's forcing you.
Does it hurt, bitch?

33
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:40,690
I dare you play paper.

34
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,160
- Play something else.
- You gotta change it up, asshole.

35
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:46,670
Is he pissed?

36
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,240
Are you pissed?

37
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,970
Their violence serves one purpose,

38
00:02:51,299 --> 00:02:53,699
their entertainment.

39
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,140
Rock, paper, scissors.

40
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,120
Rock, paper, scissors.

41
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:06,010
isn't this fun, guys?

42
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:11,090
Any losers stepping out of the time
will end up like this.

43
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,760
I want a peaceful school life.

44
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:19,720
I hope tomorrow is
a bit more fun than today.

45
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:21,770
Right?

46
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:26,410
The violence we all know about,
but look the other way.

47
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,480
A devil lives in our school.

48
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:52,360
BRAVE CITIZEN

49
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,840
Not so long ago,
we got a contract teacher.

50
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:08,570
3-MONTH CONTRACT TEACHER

51
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:09,970
- Ms. So!
- Yes!

52
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:14,210
Here I am!

53
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:17,470
Yes, sir.

54
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,100
What's going on with my errand?

55
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,760
It'll be delivered shortly.

56
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:24,600
Oh gosh, thank you, thank you!

57
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:27,290
I'll treat you to caramel macchiato.

58
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,460
Thank you!

59
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:32,240
Then could I get vanilla syrup too?

60
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,980
Of course!

61
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,190
Ms. So!

62
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,470
Yes? Did you call me?

63
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:43,510
That, that, where's that thing?

64
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,880
- Diagrams? After school teacher CVs?
- No, not that, you know...

65
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:48,750
Hey, Ms. So! Come, teacher!

66
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,840
Yes, one moment, please!

67
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:54,720
- Student scores...
- Volunteer work!

68
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:56,230
Yeah, that, where is it?

69
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,880
- It's right here, Ms. Lee!
- It was right here! Thank you!

70
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:01,520
I didn't see it here.

71
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,080
Very nice, so pretty.

72
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,580
Vice principal.

73
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,740
Yes? Did I do something wrong?

74
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:19,210
- Ms. So?
- Yes?

75
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,360
is there a problem?

76
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:22,430
Goddamn senile f...

77
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:24,930
What do you mean, sir?

78
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,990
Dammit...

79
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,130
Freaking vice!

80
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:49,860
That pervert vice
checks out my ass every time!

81
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:51,050
Very pretty...

82
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,880
I'll rip his eyes out!

83
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:57,120
He's disgusting, I'm going nuts!

84
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:59,710
Why is everyone
asking me to run errands!

85
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:01,810
He's a total dweeb by nature.

86
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,590
How dare you ignore my texts?!

87
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,710
Calm down, So Si-min,
You can't let it all crumble here.

88
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:18,370
It's okay, it's okay...

89
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:23,310
I'll become a full-time teacher!

90
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:27,240
Do whatever it takes
to get the gig.

91
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:29,780
You can do it, So Si-min!

92
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,060
By the way...

93
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:37,720
Did you tell Ms. So
about her desk?

94
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:40,640
Maybe she heard it already?

95
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,830
What's the point
of telling her that?

96
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:45,080
She's a frail type,
she might pass out.

97
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:49,090
Still, she should know
the previous owner killed herself.

98
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:53,120
The desk, chair and supplies
all belonged to Ms. Yoo.

99
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:55,330
I'm still shocked...
MOOYOUNG HIGH CONTRACT TEACHER SUICIDE

100
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,210
So immature, be quiet please.

101
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:59,340
No point in blabbering about that.
ENDLESS DEATHS OF CONTRACT TEACHERS!

102
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:05,150
STUDENT BULLYING IS SAID TO BE THE REASON...

103
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,210
Ms. So, is that you?

104
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:28,380
Ms. So?

105
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:35,740
Ms. So...

106
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,420
Ms. Lee, were you looking for me?

107
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,950
I was feeling a bit faint,
so listened to some music.

108
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:53,440
Good Afternoon.

109
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:54,960
- Hi there.
- Hey.

110
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,970
You know how much
I care about you, right?

111
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,370
Of course, Ms. Lee.

112
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,580
I have something to tell you.

113
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,590
- What is it?
- Hi, there.

114
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:07,450
There's one thing you must
be careful of here.

115
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,580
Be careful?

116
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:10,640
- Let's chat in there.
- Sure.

117
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,630
NO STUDENTS ALLOWED

118
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,210
Go buy me cigarettes!

119
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:25,100
Students shouldn't smoke.
Have some kimbap.

120
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:30,100
- Stop wasting time, just die!
- Shit, this is dried squid!

121
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:32,770
- She won't buy us cigarettes!
- This is trash!

122
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,860
- This granny won't report us, right?
- Screw that!

123
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,400
Oh my, oh my!

124
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:45,260
That's not how you treat a granny!
Goddamn hooligans.

125
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:47,470
Stop it!

126
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,510
Bon appetite.

127
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,620
Please stop! Please!

128
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,480
The granny didn't want to
make a fuss about it.

129
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:12,440
This is Han Su-kang, right?
That evil bully who haresses students!

130
00:09:12,450 --> 00:09:15,600
He did sports since childhood
and he's been beating up others.

131
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:17,311
Han hurt a kid badly,

132
00:09:18,345 --> 00:09:21,133
That's why he was kicked out of school,
and he ended up here.

133
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,626
That's even worse.
He's not even a teenager.

134
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:27,916
Since you're Ethics,
I guess you never had him.

135
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,270
Consider yourself lucky.

136
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:32,900
Why? He harasses teachers too?

137
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,220
Last year, we had a contra...

138
00:09:37,331 --> 00:09:38,471
...it's nothing!

139
00:09:39,244 --> 00:09:43,194
Until you become a full-timer,
shut your eyes and ears.

140
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:45,650
Just play dumb.

141
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,980
Like this?

142
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:50,350
Yeah.

143
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,820
Even if there's a problem
in class, hold back.

144
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:57,300
it's better to let them
resolve conflicts in their own.

145
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:59,190
Don't do anything.

146
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,940
Then nothing will happen.

147
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:01,570
Okay.

148
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:04,100
- Especially with Han Su-kang.
- Especially with Han Su-kang!

149
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:07,240
I'll aggressively hold back.

150
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:11,100
- If you witness injustice?
- I'll hold back!

151
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,920
SO YOUNG-TAEK BOXING GYM

152
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:30,780
I'm here for an inspection.

153
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,760
Just take your clothes off.

154
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,290
Right now?

155
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,290
Let's go at it.

156
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,980
Your anger cost you
at least 2 gold medals.

157
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:49,230
I gave up sports for books,
and finally landed a job.

158
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:53,220
But I'm on edge every day!
Of course I'm angry!

159
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,250
- Watch out, Kwon-joong.
- Come on.

160
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:12,970
Black belts in both
Taekwondo, Hapkido and

161
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:16,590
a boxing gold medal hopeful.
Why suddenly become a teacher?

162
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,450
Shut up, I'm done with sports!

163
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:23,600
By the way, I don't see
Mr. So at night.

164
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:26,440
is he still patrolling
the streets with Mr. Sub?

165
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,260
He's a true guardian of justice.

166
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:31,360
Screw guardian of justice!

167
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,880
This Brave Citizen award
from 20 years ago

168
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:37,710
completely ruined him.

169
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,360
He doesn't know when to give up.

170
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:44,360
I still respect him though.
He's a true man, a real one.

171
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:47,590
That man you respect
co-signed a loan,

172
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:50,510
and still has $13,940 in debt.

173
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,090
To protect this place,

174
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:55,390
I gave up my life,
dream and a gold medal

175
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:57,650
to pay it off for
the last 10 years!

176
00:11:57,650 --> 00:12:01,090
Dad irresponsibly co-signed
a loan to protect someone else,

177
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:04,770
and I protected my family.
That's the key difference.

178
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:08,540
But you two are so alike.

179
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:10,530
Me and that guy?

180
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:13,710
You may talk like that,
but you can't hold it in.

181
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:17,390
Even now, it's squirming
deep inside you.

182
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,990
No, don't you know
my life philosophy?

183
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:24,600
'It's a loss to intervene.'

184
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,020
You sure?

185
00:12:29,590 --> 00:12:31,340
I'm gonna work out a bit more.

186
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,620
- Make sure to lock up.
- Sure.

187
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:37,280
What's all these?
I haven't seen them.

188
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:41,130
Probably for kids.
Your dad's working hard.

189
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,750
He takes kids to the toilet
during class.

190
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:46,120
handles tantrums.

191
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:50,250
And the bus driver suddenly
get hired as a temp...

192
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,110
Do I look good?

193
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:00,750
Much better to hide your face.

194
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:01,710
Wear that forever.

195
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,690
Meow.

196
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:10,630
FAIR REPAIR

197
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:16,490
Seriously?!

198
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:19,180
Granny, please go away!

199
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:23,420
We sell kimbap too.
How could you sell them here?

200
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:26,820
This is unacceptable.
Please just go.

201
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:29,580
Hurry and go sell over there!

202
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,400
I have a business to run here, granny!

203
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,230
Don't come back!

204
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,990
Granny, hello!

205
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,900
I was about to buy some kimbap!
Give me everything here.

206
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,350
Again?

207
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,780
Your kimbaps are incredible.

208
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:52,230
Go a few days without them,
my mouth starts to water.

209
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,140
Thank you so much.

210
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:55,400
Thank you, thank you.

211
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:59,380
- Thank you for these.
- Have a great night!

212
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:03,620
Have a good night!

213
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:23,830
Si-min!

214
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:39,480
FULL-TIME TEACHER!

215
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,430
TRUST-DOUBT

216
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:47,020
What kind of values do you
consider important?

217
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,900
This will soon be my permanent workplace!
The promised land!

218
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:52,330
Be careful!

219
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:55,290
Trusting someone is easy.

220
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:58,450
"No matter what,
parents are on my side."

221
00:14:58,460 --> 00:15:00,270
No way.

222
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,100
Hi there!

223
00:15:03,990 --> 00:15:05,620
Hi, hi!

224
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:08,380
"School will treat you with
love and respect,

225
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,980
and be fair to all students!"

226
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:13,760
- No way!
- Definitely not!

227
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:15,220
- Morning, miss.
- Hi.

228
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,870
- Good morning.
- Hey!

229
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:20,030
Should we start to doubt than?

230
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,490
Hey, hey, teacher!

231
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,520
Teacher!

232
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,360
It's the temp.

233
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:29,450
Temps aren't teachers, man.

234
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:33,870
Once I become a full-timer,
we're going to have a chat.

235
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:37,020
"When many people share
even the smallest doubt,

236
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:39,760
it can change the world!"

237
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:42,420
"If you do nothing,
nothing will happen!"

238
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:54,080
Do you understand?

239
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,270
Yes!

240
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,730
I was born to be a teacher.

241
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,720
Isn't that Jin-hyung?

242
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:50,470
Han Su-kang?

243
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:51,710
Dammit!

244
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:56,860
Why am I hiding?

245
00:16:56,860 --> 00:17:00,320
Even if there's a problem
in class, hold back.

246
00:17:00,330 --> 00:17:01,680
Especially with Han Su-kang!

247
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:03,880
I'll aggressively hold back.

248
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,680
There's no reason
why I should get involved.

249
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:14,640
I didn't see this.
Just look the other way.

250
00:17:19,470 --> 00:17:21,310
He's starting it now!

251
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,370
- Dope!
- That was lit!

252
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,070
No way...

253
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,870
Fucking moron!

254
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:48,100
That's wild!

255
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:50,370
You punk!

256
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:52,850
Holy cow!

257
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:55,520
What are you doing there?

258
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:57,340
Don't go, please don't!

259
00:17:57,340 --> 00:18:00,150
What is it?
Fine, I won't go.

260
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,470
Han Su-kang is a scary guy.

261
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:07,890
Getting involved will
only put yourself in danger.

262
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,480
In danger?

263
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:12,100
His family is linked
to the school foundation.

264
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,650
Foundation?

265
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,440
It's not 100% sure yet,

266
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:18,600
but his dad's a big shot prosecutor,

267
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:21,260
his uncle's a police superintendent,
and his mom is a lawyer.

268
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:24,340
You really have to be careful.

269
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:33,720
If you dodge,
today's your granny's funeral.

270
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,870
Granny's funeral!

271
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,620
You'll have a test!

272
00:18:38,630 --> 00:18:39,890
Shut up!

273
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,320
A flying knee kick to the face.

274
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:46,700
This will be so tasty!

275
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,270
We should put cheese kimbap
as granny's funeral meal.

276
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,420
Or strip that mofo
for nude kimbap?

277
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:53,720
That's so dope...

278
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:57,130
Piece of trash, I'm so curious
what you'll end up as.

279
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:07,920
Let's go, boss!

280
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:16,880
Yes, I'm on the way!

281
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:46,820
Dammit!

282
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:49,070
Okay! That was a good hit.

283
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:51,870
Dammit!

284
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:54,660
Are you okay, miss?

285
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:57,380
What are you doing in the hallway?

286
00:19:57,710 --> 00:19:59,900
You really startled me!

287
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,510
Who the hell are you?!

288
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,730
What's going on?

289
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:10,270
You're not in elementary school,
don't play so hard!

290
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:13,640
Aren't you Jin-hyung?

291
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:19,730
I took you for a gentle one.
You play like this too?

292
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:22,250
Get back to your class!

293
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,060
Go on, recess is over!

294
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,880
Get going! Go!

295
00:20:34,990 --> 00:20:36,080
You okay?

296
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:37,710
Are you goddamn blind?

297
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:40,000
That bloodthirsty look...

298
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,100
A total hooligan.

299
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:46,970
Do you need to visit the infirmary?

300
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:50,200
I'm in so much pain though,

301
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:52,970
Let's be careful in the hallway, okay?

302
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,890
Kids, go back to your class.

303
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:58,980
Oh yeah, I'll throw this out for you.

304
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,610
Who's that bitch?

305
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:09,700
The replacement for the temp
who killed herself because of you.

306
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:13,350
- What's her name? Sesame?
- So Si-min.

307
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,710
The timing was crazy! Damn...

308
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,420
Oh gosh!

309
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:24,670
She killed herself because of me?

310
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:27,730
I'll rip your mouth out
if you run it off again.

311
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,170
Don't punch with your mouth.

312
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:39,440
No sound effects.

313
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:44,130
That bastard did a flying knee kick?

314
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:47,940
Yeah, his knee reached the face.

315
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:49,520
That's nothing.

316
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,790
Try the flying knee.

317
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,000
Bam!

318
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:01,830
Coach, teach me properly!

319
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:04,120
I really want to kick Han's ass.

320
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:09,390
Did you really train
dozens of boxers?

321
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:11,540
Dozens, indeed.

322
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:16,230
But only one was the real deal.

323
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,260
is he a famous boxer?

324
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:21,510
Was about to be.

325
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:23,490
Had bad luck starting out.

326
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:24,930
Bad luck

327
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:27,970
Life got messed up
because of a bad dad.

328
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:33,540
Your eyes twinkle too much.

329
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:37,080
Those eyes will hold back
upon seeing injustice.

330
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,460
Listen carefully

331
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:43,310
Justice is not tolerating injustice.

332
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:44,970
What a load of crap...

333
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:47,090
That's true courage.

334
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:54,120
Your gaze should blaze
with fiery intensity!

335
00:22:56,350 --> 00:23:01,210
During my prime as
the featherweight champ in 1999...

336
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:03,420
Your prime?

337
00:23:03,870 --> 00:23:08,260
I KOed you 33 seconds
in your first round as a champ.

338
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,590
Nuclear Fist Suh,
you see that?

339
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,870
You cried like a baby
after getting hit.

340
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:22,390
You should've said the order's up.
That chicken's getting cold!

341
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:28,740
Can you spread the word
that I can coach anywhere?

342
00:23:28,750 --> 00:23:30,910
Stop harassing him and go!

343
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,760
Fair Apartment, 201?

344
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:05,910
EXEMPLARY ANTI-BULLYING SCHOOL

345
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:09,840
- Good morning.
- Hi there.

346
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:20,720
Hello, miss.

347
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:36,080
Should I fetch the
head of student affairs?

348
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:38,770
Have you talked to
your homeroom teacher?

349
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:41,150
They all know.

350
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:44,350
That's great.

351
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:47,380
How will they handle this?

352
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:54,470
- Jin-hyung, please transfer.
- You'll be free that way.

353
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,700
What? What did you say?

354
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:00,870
No one can touch Han Su-kang.

355
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:09,970
Teachers who remain silent
are complict in the violence.

356
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:17,710
How could you unload that on me,
when you know I'm a temp...

357
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,750
I'm powerless.
I could be gone in a second.

358
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:27,080
My life is on the fine,
just like you.

359
00:25:29,850 --> 00:25:31,420
Please save me...

360
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,470
What?

361
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:46,360
I want to live.

362
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:51,110
Kill him.

363
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,230
Asshole!

364
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,620
You piece of shit!

365
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,470
I'm not doing this.

366
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,260
I even reported him to the police.

367
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:23,300
Despite evidence,
they couldn't charge him.

368
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,520
They said it doesn't prove
that Han did it.

369
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:31,210
They punished me for reporting.

370
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:39,580
Jin-hyung, have you thought
about transferring?

371
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:45,230
I'm not saying
it's the right thing to do.

372
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,530
Why should you,
you're the victim here.

373
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,110
I know that, but...

374
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:50,630
I won't transfer.

375
00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:55,170
I won't quit school either.

376
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,620
Why should I give it up?

377
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:05,870
Wrongdoers, should face consequences.

378
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,260
I can't endure it.

379
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:22,480
if he doesn't get punished...

380
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:42,350
He should curve his stubborness
and just transfer out.

381
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:46,850
What's the point
of consulting you?

382
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,120
He looked desperate.

383
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:53,620
And you're not?
Will you risk your job?

384
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:06,730
Su-kang's mother sent us rice cakes

385
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:09,270
Congratulating us for
Anti-Bullying School Award.

386
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:14,160
I love pumpkin rice cakes!
Look it's so sticky!

387
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:20,170
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR AWARD
- HAN SU-KANG

388
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:25,340
That scent of authority.

389
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:29,690
I shouldn't eat this...

390
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:31,990
But!

391
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,980
I'm sorry, Jin-hyung,
my hands are tired.

392
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,120
There's nothing I can do.

393
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,430
Why should I get insolved
when eithers won't?

394
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:47,160
I'm at the bottom of the food chain.

395
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:52,630
That's how it is, mom!
Everyone lives like this!

396
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:55,600
This is delicious.
My tummy's full!

397
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,840
Don't live that way.

398
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:04,960
You're much too young
to compromise!

399
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:08,300
Is that how I taught you?
How I raised you?

400
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:09,800
Is this justice?

401
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:14,980
You're not my daughter anymore.
Mine died in the ring earlier.

402
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:38,250
A student came to me for a talk...

403
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:43,150
Here comes the temp!

404
00:29:43,350 --> 00:29:45,590
Get rid of your cigaratters, please.

405
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:49,730
Su-kang, may I talk to you
for a bit?

406
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,320
Now?

407
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:54,600
Wanna go on a date?

408
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,770
Piss off!

409
00:29:58,110 --> 00:29:58,980
Just the two of us?

410
00:29:59,670 --> 00:30:01,310
Yes, just us two.

411
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,900
You need someone
to talk to right now.

412
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:10,750
Talk? How about physical talk?

413
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:13,950
One body to another!

414
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,570
No, not that.

415
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:19,540
I want to hear what's troubling you.

416
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:24,690
The solution to all problems starts
by honestly expressing feelings.

417
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:27,990
Let's uncover your trauma,
and resolve it together.

418
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:30,370
Stop acting like a teacher,
you're just a temp.

419
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:35,410
You're not harassing others
on purpose, right?

420
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,130
Piss off.

421
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:30,760
- Did you receive this too?
- I got the same one!

422
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:44,760
Who was it?!

423
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:48,010
A STUDENT CAME TO ME BEGGING FOR HIS LIFE

424
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:48,010
Who reported us
to the education board?!

425
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:03,610
- Isn't that Su-kang car?
- Yeah.

426
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:04,950
Out of the way!

427
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,780
That's Su-kang's mom!

428
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,500
Holy shit!

429
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:14,650
Guys! Big ass news!

430
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:16,070
Hey! Come on! Hurry!

431
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,320
This is nuts,
it's gonna be lit!

432
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,840
Smile, bud.

433
00:32:27,050 --> 00:32:30,750
What kind of grudge is making you
block my boy's future!

434
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,970
If he really beat someone,
bring me the victim!

435
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:37,590
Let's get a look at him!

436
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:39,980
Attorney Lee.

437
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:43,820
Listen carefully.

438
00:32:44,050 --> 00:32:47,100
As per Criminal Act Artical 307,
this pertains to libel and slander.

439
00:32:47,110 --> 00:32:49,110
Spreading rumors can
result in imprisonment

440
00:32:49,110 --> 00:32:52,320
up to 5 years,
or a fine up to $10,000.

441
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:55,940
Article 311 regarding defamation
can also be applicable.

442
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:57,710
So, who was it?

443
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:03,360
If you some forward now,
she may go early on you.

444
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,840
You need to at least
lower the fine.

445
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:09,840
But Mr. Lee,

446
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:14,350
according to Articles 310 and 312
of the Criminal Act,

447
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:17,090
if the information is related
to the public interest and factual.

448
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,120
it may not be subject to punishment.

449
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,300
Well, indeed.

450
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:26,800
While there's room for disagreement,
without clear evidence,

451
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:31,120
and considering it's a personal matter,
it can't be deemed public interest.

452
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,820
Madam, I'll proceed with filling
a criminal complaint immediately.

453
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:35,290
What?

454
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,730
- Room for disagreement?
- Yes.

455
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:41,080
Whose attorney are you?

456
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,730
You're fired!
Get the hell out of my face!

457
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,210
I'm sorry, madame.

458
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:48,340
You're the one, right?

459
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:51,580
It was you last year!

460
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:55,630
We wrapped it up quietly.
What the hell did you do?!

461
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:59,210
Did you study the law
while laying low for a year?

462
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,730
You dare to mention the law to me?
Don't you know who I am?

463
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:04,780
Don't want your promotion?

464
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:06,670
Of course I do.

465
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:09,220
But it's not that, ma'am...

466
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:11,090
Ma'am, please calm down...

467
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,870
And you? Don't want that
principal seat next year?

468
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:16,220
Of course I do,
I have to.

469
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:19,850
Then find the culprit
and make him beg!

470
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:21,120
Yes, right away.

471
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:23,580
Who was it?

472
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,240
Ma'am,

473
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:28,000
if you give me some time,
I'll find the culprit.

474
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:32,150
It's me, ma'am.

475
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:34,330
I did it...

476
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,680
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

477
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:39,600
I'm sorry.

478
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:41,990
Who are you?

479
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:45,340
I'm sorry...

480
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:48,120
A worthless scavenger at best.

481
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,750
You're a bitch without principles.

482
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:56,040
Fire this bitch immediately.

483
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:57,620
I'm so sorry, ma'am!

484
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,490
I'll make sure
this doesn't happen again!

485
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,740
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

486
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:06,570
How can a contract teacher
cause so much chaos?!

487
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:09,660
I'm really sorry,
I'll take care of this.

488
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:11,590
Isn't this fun?

489
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:14,590
Si-min just stepped on shit.

490
00:35:14,590 --> 00:35:16,850
Jin-hyung's stinky ass shit.

491
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:18,760
Kimbap.

492
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:23,370
You can never get away from me.

493
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:33,610
Ms. So, apologize to her again!

494
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:38,480
I'm sorry... I'm sorry!

495
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:45,080
So, what will you do?

496
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,070
- What?
- Sir.

497
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:52,720
Su-kang, I'll fire her first...

498
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,190
Fire her?

499
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:01,010
That's no fun... sir.

500
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,180
And then?

501
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:10,130
The next step would be...

502
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:12,940
Su-kang, I'll take care of this...

503
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:24,950
Vice, do your job, Okey?

504
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:28,370
If you fire her,
I can't have fun with her.

505
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:30,210
Sir.

506
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:36,380
Su-kang, I'll take care of it...

507
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:38,330
Sir.

508
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,560
Have you looked into
Han Su-kang?

509
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:08,310
Can he be punished?

510
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,090
It's complicated.

511
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:14,340
We received a few reports,
but don't have direct evidence.

512
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:17,240
The victim is the evidence.
This makes no sense.

513
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:21,590
Jin-hyung may be charged
for false accusations.

514
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,760
Why is this world so messed up?!

515
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,570
Are you really a cop?

516
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:31,310
Why can't you protect the week?

517
00:37:31,310 --> 00:37:33,880
You think cops can do everything?

518
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:35,990
If I could, I'd save
the entire world.

519
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,900
You got it tough.

520
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:51,760
Mr. So!

521
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:57,710
Shouldn't you greet your dad?

522
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,350
Is something wrong, sweetie?

523
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:05,000
Tell me, and I'll take care of it.

524
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:09,970
Do you want something
to be wrong every day?

525
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:12,760
How will you take care of it?

526
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:15,610
Just take care of yourself,
and don't get in my way!

527
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:20,370
I know, I should rip my lips out...

528
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:23,030
Sorry, sweetie...

529
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:56,960
- Wow, temp!
- So nice to see you, temp.

530
00:38:56,970 --> 00:38:58,770
What are you doing here alone?

531
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:06,720
Yo, you got in the way
that day with Kimbap, right?

532
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:09,550
Did it feel good to tattle
on me to the education board?

533
00:39:09,910 --> 00:39:13,640
- Did it?
- Don't pretend to be a teacher.

534
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:16,570
How much do temps make?
Do they get minium wape?

535
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:18,210
That's enough, kids.

536
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:22,180
You're dating Jin-hyung, right?

537
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:25,990
- You even kissed a student?
- Forget it.

538
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,840
Give me your number.

539
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,870
I'll be managing you from now.

540
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:32,860
You must be too stupid
to even be curious,

541
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:35,640
why you weren't fired today.

542
00:39:44,290 --> 00:39:47,110
Be obedient, and you can
become a full-timer.

543
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:49,310
You know that's not
even work for me.

544
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:54,420
I'm being honest, Si-min.

545
00:39:54,940 --> 00:40:00,100
Shit, she set on a student's lap.
She's a habitual cougar!

546
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:01,830
She's so thirsty.

547
00:40:01,830 --> 00:40:03,040
Baby.

548
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:05,950
Should we go out?

549
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:07,500
She's gonna cry.

550
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:10,840
Let's just go shoot some hoops.

551
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:17,970
Remember, be obedient
and you'll be...

552
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:19,950
a full-timer.

553
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,790
If you're disobedient?

554
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:24,110
You're fucked.

555
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:31,190
Miss, are you okay?

556
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,990
Yes, I'm okay.

557
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,650
Mind your business.

558
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:54,350
You don't get a second chance.

559
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:04,220
Do you take us all for fools?

560
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:07,120
Do you think we all gave up
and didn't even try?

561
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:09,720
School violence is fought
with lawyers now.

562
00:41:09,730 --> 00:41:11,940
Lawyers from both sides
fight at the committee.

563
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:13,060
Then what happens?

564
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:18,270
Jin-hyung will get a public defender,
and Han gets an army of lawyers.

565
00:41:19,870 --> 00:41:22,270
They'll look the other way this time.

566
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,850
If you want to join the factulty,
think before you talk.

567
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,250
Can't you just...

568
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:31,010
shut your eyes, ears,
and become invisible?

569
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:33,890
- Can't you do that?
- Of course I can, Ms. Lee.

570
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:39,130
Thank you and I'm sorry...

571
00:41:51,690 --> 00:41:53,110
Goddamn!

572
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:54,730
I'm sorry...

573
00:41:54,730 --> 00:41:57,240
Are you kidding me, bitchs!

574
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:58,450
Yo!

575
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:04,540
You got shit for your eyes?

576
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:09,370
Say what?

577
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,350
What was that?
Did you just sigh?

578
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:17,030
If you're gonna apologize,

579
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:24,390
use words that feel sincere,
for crying out loud!

580
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:34,250
Am I at fault?

581
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:37,950
What did I do so wrong?

582
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,150
And Jin-hyung?

583
00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:45,100
What did he do?

584
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,880
There are lines in the world
that must be respected.

585
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:55,710
Are they so insignificant

586
00:42:55,710 --> 00:43:00,220
that they can be crossed
for your amusement?

587
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:06,130
You were the ones
who crossed the line.

588
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:07,970
Are you fucking listening?!

589
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:23,650
Damn, I've had it with you!

590
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:26,600
How much more beating
do you need to understand?

591
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:30,180
Have another slap, bitch!

592
00:44:07,690 --> 00:44:10,090
Watch your front!

593
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:13,120
Nice!

594
00:44:15,530 --> 00:44:17,090
Come on, asshole!

595
00:44:17,850 --> 00:44:19,330
Get back to your positions!

596
00:44:19,330 --> 00:44:21,350
What the hell was that?!

597
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:23,600
- Give me the ball.
- You should've stolen it!

598
00:44:26,970 --> 00:44:28,310
Oops, sorry!

599
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:32,800
Asshole, that was a 3-pointer!

600
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,600
- Shit, what was that?
- Who the hell are they?

601
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:37,900
I don't believe this.

602
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:40,860
- Aren't they high school kids?
- They must be nuts.

603
00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:45,860
Fried chicken delivery!

604
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:53,120
I'll come back later.

605
00:44:53,550 --> 00:44:57,330
- Aren't you still in high school?
- We are, asshole!

606
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:10,140
Fucker!

607
00:45:21,310 --> 00:45:24,870
If you do something wrong,
you gotta pay the price, asshole!

608
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,340
Yeah, pay the price.

609
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:31,870
You can sure talk the talk.

610
00:45:43,130 --> 00:45:45,720
The perpetrator must
pay for his sins.

611
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:27,590
What are you?

612
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,710
Meow.

613
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:33,090
Goddammit.

614
00:46:45,950 --> 00:46:47,250
You son of a bitch!

615
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:00,880
Holy shit, what am I
seeing right now?

616
00:47:01,230 --> 00:47:02,010
Shit...

617
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:34,040
Kick him! Go on!

618
00:48:22,830 --> 00:48:26,350
- Is this for real?
- That's messed up.

619
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:35,800
- Shit!
- Get out of here!

620
00:48:35,810 --> 00:48:38,220
- Boss! We gotta go!
- Let's get them!

621
00:48:38,230 --> 00:48:40,970
- We gotta get out of here!
- Let's go!

622
00:48:41,170 --> 00:48:42,430
- Get out of here first!
- Boss, let's just go!

623
00:48:43,810 --> 00:48:45,780
- Don't move!
- Go! Move!

624
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:47,600
- Stop!
- Come on, Su-kang!

625
00:48:47,610 --> 00:48:49,610
Come on! Run!

626
00:48:49,610 --> 00:48:51,440
Su-kang, we have to go!

627
00:48:51,450 --> 00:48:55,250
- Don't fucking touch me!
- We have to go!

628
00:49:47,004 --> 00:49:49,254
EXEMPLARY ANTI-BULLYING SCHOOL

629
00:49:51,074 --> 00:49:52,384
Good morning!

630
00:49:53,114 --> 00:49:56,074
Su-kang deserves
to get beaten up a lot more.

631
00:49:56,214 --> 00:50:00,594
- Say that to his face.
- If it was me...

632
00:50:03,764 --> 00:50:05,094
What is going on?

633
00:50:05,594 --> 00:50:07,014
I got a huge news!

634
00:50:08,334 --> 00:50:10,244
Su-kang got his ass kicked!

635
00:50:10,934 --> 00:50:11,724
Oh gosh!

636
00:50:11,794 --> 00:50:14,524
Be honest, feels good, right?

637
00:50:15,264 --> 00:50:20,404
How could a teacher feel good
about a student getting beaten up?

638
00:50:20,444 --> 00:50:23,744
I know. Aren't you all
being a little too happy?

639
00:50:23,864 --> 00:50:26,364
We're not happy at all.

640
00:50:26,584 --> 00:50:28,534
Who beat him up?

641
00:50:28,624 --> 00:50:30,164
A man in a cat mask.

642
00:50:31,764 --> 00:50:35,084
A man in a cat mask, gosh!

643
00:50:35,164 --> 00:50:36,424
Take a pic, get that.

644
00:50:36,504 --> 00:50:38,924
HAN SU-KANG GOT
HIS ASS BEATEN LOL

645
00:50:51,314 --> 00:50:52,884
Hey, Han Su-kang is coming!

646
00:50:54,314 --> 00:50:56,564
Excuse me!
What's going on here?

647
00:50:56,834 --> 00:50:57,924
Ms. Lee!

648
00:51:00,104 --> 00:51:01,144
Su-kang was beaten up?

649
00:51:01,164 --> 00:51:03,554
I feel so bad,
Su-kang was beaten up...

650
00:51:11,824 --> 00:51:13,784
Good morning, Ms. Yoo.

651
00:51:14,214 --> 00:51:15,594
Pretty flowers, right?

652
00:51:15,874 --> 00:51:17,514
I've never met you,
but I'll bring you flowers often.

653
00:51:48,454 --> 00:51:49,454
Who did this?

654
00:51:49,454 --> 00:51:52,164
Which one of you
lost your damn mind?!

655
00:51:52,164 --> 00:51:56,164
Goddamn bitches!
Fess up now!

656
00:51:56,334 --> 00:51:57,664
What's going on?

657
00:51:59,294 --> 00:52:00,424
- Han Su-kang.
- What is this?

658
00:52:00,424 --> 00:52:03,924
Who scribbled on his desk?
Who was it?!

659
00:52:03,924 --> 00:52:06,424
I won't note this
in his school record.

660
00:52:06,424 --> 00:52:08,514
Desks can be swapped out.

661
00:52:08,694 --> 00:52:10,804
Why cause a ruckus
so early in the morning?

662
00:52:11,014 --> 00:52:13,144
School should be a place of etiquette.

663
00:52:14,724 --> 00:52:15,534
Etiquette?

664
00:52:50,554 --> 00:52:52,224
My legs are trembling.

665
00:52:53,094 --> 00:52:55,014
That was my first time scolding him...

666
00:53:11,154 --> 00:53:14,514
Boss, go easy.
You'll be fucked if you get pulled over!

667
00:53:14,544 --> 00:53:16,784
I won't be fucked
in this lifetime.

668
00:53:23,424 --> 00:53:24,844
Who the hell was that damn kitty?

669
00:53:25,194 --> 00:53:27,784
Not the basketball bastards
or guys from Jonghyun High.

670
00:53:27,814 --> 00:53:29,014
Not from Yirae High either.

671
00:53:29,034 --> 00:53:31,174
A hidden fighter in our school?

672
00:53:31,924 --> 00:53:32,914
Shit! Shit!

673
00:53:34,464 --> 00:53:35,464
Shit! Shit!

674
00:53:35,554 --> 00:53:37,684
I really feel like Kimbap!

675
00:53:42,524 --> 00:53:45,064
Boss, let's get Jin-hyung
and have some fun.

676
00:53:45,874 --> 00:53:47,454
What a psycho!

677
00:53:47,864 --> 00:53:49,694
I can hear you think
from back here.

678
00:53:49,694 --> 00:53:50,904
Love that idea!

679
00:53:50,904 --> 00:53:53,534
What's the themes today?
How will you mess him up?

680
00:53:53,534 --> 00:53:55,534
Have I ever disappointed you all?

681
00:54:11,774 --> 00:54:12,844
Your gaze is key.

682
00:54:12,844 --> 00:54:15,264
Maintain a humble posture,
but confident eyes!

683
00:54:15,304 --> 00:54:16,344
Constant footwork!

684
00:54:16,434 --> 00:54:18,104
That's it.
Too slow!

685
00:54:18,134 --> 00:54:19,554
Light feet! Off the ground!

686
00:54:20,064 --> 00:54:22,214
Coach, things are heating up
at my school.

687
00:54:22,244 --> 00:54:22,974
Why?

688
00:54:23,314 --> 00:54:25,854
Because of the masked kitty,
a teacher named So Si-min.

689
00:54:25,894 --> 00:54:27,314
So Si-min?

690
00:54:27,904 --> 00:54:29,694
She's my daughter.

691
00:54:31,094 --> 00:54:34,634
The real-deal boxer I trained.

692
00:54:37,614 --> 00:54:41,834
That boxer whose life got
messed up because of a bad dad?

693
00:54:42,454 --> 00:54:44,294
Feel good, Mr. 33 Seconds?

694
00:54:44,294 --> 00:54:45,294
Yeah, feels good.

695
00:54:46,864 --> 00:54:48,174
Just spill it already.

696
00:54:48,274 --> 00:54:49,844
It's a scecret.

697
00:54:49,844 --> 00:54:51,644
I knew it was you right away.

698
00:54:51,844 --> 00:54:54,464
How could a teacher
beat up a student?

699
00:54:56,254 --> 00:54:58,064
It was on-site education!

700
00:54:58,224 --> 00:54:59,594
Educating hooligans.

701
00:54:59,644 --> 00:55:01,144
It was violence!

702
00:55:01,814 --> 00:55:03,684
No, justice!

703
00:55:04,024 --> 00:55:05,934
You said that was all bullshit.

704
00:55:06,144 --> 00:55:08,944
Whatever. It's right now,
wrong back then.

705
00:55:09,524 --> 00:55:12,824
Just don't do anything, will you?
It doesn't fit you at all.

706
00:55:12,964 --> 00:55:15,444
Accept reality like before.

707
00:55:15,554 --> 00:55:18,594
You're good at turning a blind eye
to injustice. Live only for yourself.

708
00:55:20,824 --> 00:55:24,164
I don't want you
to get hurt in any way.

709
00:55:25,664 --> 00:55:28,294
It doesn't suit me, huh?

710
00:55:29,294 --> 00:55:31,424
It felt awkward, actually.

711
00:55:33,554 --> 00:55:36,134
There's no answer to how
one should live,

712
00:55:36,134 --> 00:55:37,924
but people will eventually find out.

713
00:55:38,554 --> 00:55:40,934
live a safe life.

714
00:55:42,884 --> 00:55:44,044
But Kwon-joong.

715
00:55:44,764 --> 00:55:47,164
Should I wear a cape?

716
00:55:47,534 --> 00:55:48,924
Will you stop it?!

717
00:55:48,944 --> 00:55:50,654
Hey! Stop it!

718
00:55:55,984 --> 00:55:57,324
I don't believe it!

719
00:55:57,324 --> 00:55:59,074
- Wait, please!
- I'll kill you!

720
00:56:00,034 --> 00:56:01,664
FAIR REPAIR

721
00:56:01,664 --> 00:56:03,584
Please sew it back
as strong as possible.

722
00:56:03,704 --> 00:56:06,244
Don't worry,
I'm pretty good at this.

723
00:56:06,584 --> 00:56:07,504
Good night!

724
00:56:07,544 --> 00:56:09,294
- All right, bye!
- Bye!

725
00:56:09,914 --> 00:56:11,334
Let's see...

726
00:56:12,664 --> 00:56:15,754
How can I do the best job?

727
00:56:23,264 --> 00:56:24,304
Get going!

728
00:56:25,184 --> 00:56:26,724
Don't be dramatic, asshole!

729
00:56:36,074 --> 00:56:39,534
If you don't come back in 5,
I'll make you do it again naked.

730
00:57:15,564 --> 00:57:16,594
Oh Lord...

731
00:57:20,444 --> 00:57:22,194
Those bastards.

732
00:57:23,154 --> 00:57:24,574
Jin-hyung, are you okay?

733
00:57:24,574 --> 00:57:27,454
What did they do to you,
stupid punks...

734
00:57:27,914 --> 00:57:28,794
Byung-jin.

735
00:57:28,794 --> 00:57:30,074
Half fried, half seasoned...

736
00:57:30,284 --> 00:57:31,284
What?

737
00:57:32,084 --> 00:57:34,214
Half fried, half seasoned...

738
00:57:34,424 --> 00:57:35,544
Okay.

739
00:57:40,074 --> 00:57:42,794
Jin-hyung, just hold on...

740
00:57:46,474 --> 00:57:47,834
The sewing is amazing...

741
00:57:48,944 --> 00:57:51,984
I should drop this nonsense.

742
00:57:56,074 --> 00:57:57,954
It was fun for a minute.

743
00:58:06,764 --> 00:58:07,914
Holy cow!

744
00:58:08,324 --> 00:58:09,364
What is it? Byung-jin!

745
00:58:09,394 --> 00:58:12,354
Miss, Jin-hyung got bullied
in his underwear.

746
00:58:12,454 --> 00:58:13,084
Hurry!

747
00:58:13,114 --> 00:58:14,824
- What? Where?
- The billiard hall.

748
00:58:16,254 --> 00:58:18,424
Wait, you have to
dress up as a man.

749
00:58:19,864 --> 00:58:22,964
Wait, what are you doing?

750
00:58:25,274 --> 00:58:26,984
I know everything.
My hero.

751
00:58:27,364 --> 00:58:29,944
What? It wasn't me.

752
00:58:30,134 --> 00:58:32,474
I saw you beating Han up
while wearing this.

753
00:58:32,574 --> 00:58:36,284
I called the police that right,
and spread the news about the cat.

754
00:58:37,394 --> 00:58:38,854
Please help, miss.

755
00:58:39,904 --> 00:58:42,444
Will you be okay?
Should I call home?

756
00:58:43,324 --> 00:58:45,404
They were just fooling around.

757
00:58:47,574 --> 00:58:49,454
They're good friends.

758
00:58:49,994 --> 00:58:51,414
That makes sense?

759
00:58:51,454 --> 00:58:53,204
This is practically a crime.

760
00:58:53,834 --> 00:58:57,064
Even if they're good friends,
this is too much.

761
00:59:05,554 --> 00:59:06,314
Here!

762
00:59:13,514 --> 00:59:17,234
And... wear this at least.

763
00:59:22,454 --> 00:59:23,874
What are you doing?!
Hey! Hey!

764
00:59:25,604 --> 00:59:27,854
This is funny as well.

765
00:59:29,694 --> 00:59:30,634
Yeah, it's me.

766
00:59:30,824 --> 00:59:33,074
I sent you a few dope videos.

767
00:59:34,224 --> 00:59:38,304
Change my voice, edit it,
and upload it online.

768
00:59:38,664 --> 00:59:41,584
There are plenty of pervs
who love this stuff.

769
00:59:46,754 --> 00:59:49,104
It's always good to have
new material.

770
00:59:52,134 --> 00:59:53,264
Let's set a new record for views.

771
00:59:53,264 --> 00:59:54,224
Eun-gyo!

772
00:59:54,934 --> 00:59:56,124
- Yeah?
- It's your turn.

773
00:59:57,524 --> 00:59:58,164
Hey.

774
00:59:59,654 --> 01:00:00,814
Take it with you.

775
01:00:02,444 --> 01:00:04,444
What a fucking devil...

776
01:00:10,154 --> 01:00:12,284
Don't get in the way!

777
01:00:12,414 --> 01:00:16,124
- Hurry up!
- I'm gonna play. Move aside.

778
01:00:16,294 --> 01:00:17,584
KO JIN-HYUNG

779
01:00:17,624 --> 01:00:19,414
It's the kitty.

780
01:00:20,294 --> 01:00:21,714
He came on his own.

781
01:00:21,844 --> 01:00:24,644
Hm? I don't see Jin-hyung.

782
01:00:43,904 --> 01:00:46,324
I'm gonna rip your mask off today.

783
01:01:33,224 --> 01:01:33,934
Buddy!

784
01:02:14,914 --> 01:02:15,974
Meow!

785
01:02:41,034 --> 01:02:41,824
No, Jin-hyung!

786
01:02:45,744 --> 01:02:48,024
Die, Han Su-kang!

787
01:02:48,944 --> 01:02:50,654
Oh, no!

788
01:02:52,614 --> 01:02:54,334
BILLIARD HALL

789
01:02:54,364 --> 01:02:55,534
Goddamnit!

790
01:02:56,534 --> 01:02:57,844
What the hell?!

791
01:02:58,164 --> 01:02:59,124
You fucking!

792
01:02:59,794 --> 01:03:00,964
Asshole!

793
01:03:07,294 --> 01:03:08,754
Son of a bitch...

794
01:03:24,934 --> 01:03:26,284
Please save me...

795
01:03:27,224 --> 01:03:28,734
I want to live.

796
01:03:53,254 --> 01:03:55,004
Hey, hey!

797
01:03:55,214 --> 01:03:56,544
What did you do?!

798
01:03:57,254 --> 01:03:57,924
Get up!

799
01:03:58,924 --> 01:03:59,654
Get up!

800
01:03:59,684 --> 01:04:01,814
Get up!

801
01:04:02,434 --> 01:04:04,434
- Let's go!
- Die!

802
01:04:04,644 --> 01:04:06,894
Die, you bastard!

803
01:04:07,184 --> 01:04:08,774
- Come on!
- Die!

804
01:04:09,064 --> 01:04:12,944
Just die already!

805
01:04:13,654 --> 01:04:14,824
Die!

806
01:04:15,904 --> 01:04:18,574
- Die! Die!
- Please!

807
01:04:22,574 --> 01:04:23,784
This could've been bad.

808
01:04:24,014 --> 01:04:26,974
The knife just missed an artery.

809
01:04:28,154 --> 01:04:30,484
She lost a lot of blood,
but she'll be fine.

810
01:04:31,214 --> 01:04:33,714
She'll be moved to a room,
so follow the nurse.

811
01:04:34,544 --> 01:04:36,674
We'll watch her for a day or two.

812
01:04:36,924 --> 01:04:37,844
Thank you.

813
01:04:39,674 --> 01:04:41,014
Jin-hyung!

814
01:04:41,054 --> 01:04:43,184
I was told Jin-hyung is here...

815
01:04:43,564 --> 01:04:45,684
Oh my dear Lord, my baby...

816
01:04:46,474 --> 01:04:48,314
My baby...

817
01:04:48,854 --> 01:04:51,274
What are you doing here?

818
01:04:51,464 --> 01:04:52,794
Are you okay?

819
01:04:53,544 --> 01:04:55,044
Are you hurt?

820
01:04:55,944 --> 01:04:57,534
Granny, why are you here?

821
01:04:59,154 --> 01:05:01,694
You shouldn't be here!

822
01:05:02,454 --> 01:05:05,244
You can't be here!

823
01:05:05,704 --> 01:05:07,384
It's too dangerous!

824
01:05:07,584 --> 01:05:08,744
It's okay.

825
01:05:10,584 --> 01:05:12,374
Don't worry about me.

826
01:05:14,044 --> 01:05:16,964
Let's go home, darling.

827
01:05:21,224 --> 01:05:22,724
You almost died, moron.

828
01:05:26,764 --> 01:05:28,104
Jeez...

829
01:05:28,604 --> 01:05:31,184
I've never heard of a teacher
getting stabbed.

830
01:05:31,334 --> 01:05:32,414
Are you all right?

831
01:05:32,434 --> 01:05:35,354
It's just a few stitches.

832
01:05:35,504 --> 01:05:38,844
Don't act tough.
This is not why I trained you.

833
01:05:39,214 --> 01:05:41,824
You should've called the cops
Why'd you get invoived?

834
01:05:41,824 --> 01:05:44,354
Dude, could you shut him up?

835
01:05:45,494 --> 01:05:49,834
And don't ever call the cops.
Jin-hyung will get hurt.

836
01:05:50,704 --> 01:05:51,624
I'm a cop.

837
01:06:11,934 --> 01:06:14,774
That cat came to beat me up
but saved me?

838
01:06:14,814 --> 01:06:16,444
Die, Han Su-kang!

839
01:06:20,444 --> 01:06:21,484
Who are you?

840
01:06:21,714 --> 01:06:23,594
Meow.

841
01:06:28,534 --> 01:06:30,744
- Holy shit!
- What is it now?

842
01:06:31,744 --> 01:06:32,804
Who's that?

843
01:06:33,374 --> 01:06:34,084
He went and changed.

844
01:06:34,204 --> 01:06:36,504
He's taller. I don't think
it's the same cat.

845
01:06:36,624 --> 01:06:38,084
Are they a gang?

846
01:06:38,544 --> 01:06:39,304
Who are you?

847
01:06:40,214 --> 01:06:43,284
We're brave cats.

848
01:06:44,134 --> 01:06:44,924
Meow.

849
01:06:57,974 --> 01:06:59,854
What's all that?

850
01:07:00,234 --> 01:07:01,744
You gotta stay for a few days.

851
01:07:01,854 --> 01:07:02,644
Going to work.

852
01:07:02,664 --> 01:07:04,624
You got over 20 stitches.

853
01:07:04,694 --> 01:07:06,324
I just need to be careful.

854
01:07:06,494 --> 01:07:09,074
For Jin-hyung's sake,
I can't miss work.

855
01:07:10,184 --> 01:07:11,994
He swung a knife.

856
01:07:12,034 --> 01:07:14,294
If the school finds out,
that's instant expulsion.

857
01:07:15,104 --> 01:07:17,694
Look the other way on this.

858
01:07:18,374 --> 01:07:20,124
So? What will you do?

859
01:07:20,834 --> 01:07:23,404
I don't know, I'll do whatever
to help him out.

860
01:07:23,534 --> 01:07:25,134
Hey, Si-min!

861
01:07:27,744 --> 01:07:29,544
What's with dad's face?

862
01:07:30,554 --> 01:07:33,514
So-called wounds of justice
from defending your honor.

863
01:07:33,604 --> 01:07:34,934
What do you mean?

864
01:07:35,264 --> 01:07:36,764
He fought Han?!

865
01:07:37,274 --> 01:07:39,274
I guess he wanted to
do something for you.

866
01:07:45,824 --> 01:07:47,904
You two are the same...

867
01:07:50,134 --> 01:07:52,214
Christ!

868
01:07:54,194 --> 01:07:55,114
Where are you going?

869
01:07:55,204 --> 01:07:56,664
She's going to work.

870
01:07:56,764 --> 01:07:58,604
No, not for a few days...

871
01:08:01,474 --> 01:08:02,924
I'll drive you!

872
01:08:02,954 --> 01:08:05,054
Don't come, I'm taking a cab.

873
01:08:08,924 --> 01:08:11,344
Stop it, I told you not to come!

874
01:08:12,054 --> 01:08:13,554
I have to go home too.

875
01:08:13,554 --> 01:08:14,724
Ms. So?

876
01:08:17,214 --> 01:08:19,604
Oh gosh, Ms. Lee!

877
01:08:19,734 --> 01:08:21,404
What brings you here?

878
01:08:21,604 --> 01:08:24,684
My father got hurt
so I accompained him.

879
01:08:28,674 --> 01:08:31,924
I'm Si-min's dad.
I got hurt a bit.

880
01:08:32,734 --> 01:08:33,694
I see...

881
01:08:33,864 --> 01:08:36,024
What brings you here, Ms. Lee?

882
01:08:36,914 --> 01:08:41,044
Um, me? I'm nursing my sister.

883
01:08:41,754 --> 01:08:43,944
I got no husband.

884
01:08:43,964 --> 01:08:47,344
I got no husband,

885
01:08:47,424 --> 01:08:49,344
I see, I'm single too.

886
01:08:51,764 --> 01:08:53,844
Ms. Lee, you must be busy.

887
01:08:54,144 --> 01:08:55,564
Right, I have to go.

888
01:08:55,744 --> 01:08:57,624
- I'll see you at school.
- Yeah, sure.

889
01:08:57,824 --> 01:09:01,204
- I hope you get better soon.
- Okay, bye!

890
01:09:01,314 --> 01:09:04,654
- Okay, okay.
- But my sister is asleep...

891
01:09:21,124 --> 01:09:22,264
You sleeping?

892
01:09:30,964 --> 01:09:33,134
LONDON OLYMPICS BOXING TEAM SELECTION

893
01:09:39,984 --> 01:09:40,994
Si-min...

894
01:09:41,734 --> 01:09:45,814
The day of the national team selection...

895
01:09:48,524 --> 01:09:49,694
2011 OLYMPICS NATIONAL TEAM SELECTION

896
01:09:49,694 --> 01:09:50,154
Get in there!
2011 OLYMPICS NATIONAL TEAM SELECTION

897
01:09:50,154 --> 01:09:50,824
Get in there!

898
01:09:53,714 --> 01:09:54,884
Body forward, hook!

899
01:09:59,874 --> 01:10:01,794
Get in! Closer!

900
01:10:07,304 --> 01:10:09,514
What's wrong?
Keep your guard up!

901
01:10:21,894 --> 01:10:22,684
Si-min!

902
01:10:23,234 --> 01:10:25,314
That's the count!

903
01:10:25,394 --> 01:10:31,054
Yang becomes the first national boxer
in the women's division!

904
01:10:34,314 --> 01:10:35,564
Are you nuts?!

905
01:10:35,914 --> 01:10:37,624
Do you think this is a joke?

906
01:10:38,534 --> 01:10:40,494
Forget it, let's talk at home.

907
01:10:41,174 --> 01:10:42,634
Tell me straight.

908
01:10:43,604 --> 01:10:45,314
Why did you drop your guard?

909
01:10:46,584 --> 01:10:50,004
Have some energy drinks.

910
01:10:50,844 --> 01:10:53,354
Your dad's gym is
about to get seized, right?

911
01:10:53,614 --> 01:10:55,384
Going to auction soon?

912
01:10:56,384 --> 01:10:57,934
Think it over.

913
01:10:59,091 --> 01:11:02,131
Just drop your guard 20cm.

914
01:11:02,977 --> 01:11:04,727
Hey, motherless pup.

915
01:11:04,814 --> 01:11:07,234
You couldn't win a trophy
for your dead mom?

916
01:11:07,524 --> 01:11:09,304
Money is all you can think of?

917
01:11:09,454 --> 01:11:10,914
Stupid hobo.

918
01:11:11,434 --> 01:11:13,264
You threw the match for me?

919
01:11:13,824 --> 01:11:16,654
But I protected our home
and the gym...

920
01:11:18,114 --> 01:11:20,914
I'm still young, I can train more
for the Olympics...

921
01:11:20,914 --> 01:11:22,954
Why should you?
Why throw the match?!

922
01:11:23,524 --> 01:11:25,444
You're much too young
to compromise!

923
01:11:27,044 --> 01:11:30,924
You're not my daughter anymore.
Mine died in the ring earlier.

924
01:11:41,094 --> 01:11:47,394
You gave up your dream
to protect the family...

925
01:11:49,354 --> 01:11:50,694
What I said...

926
01:11:53,074 --> 01:11:54,244
was toward myself.

927
01:11:54,694 --> 01:11:56,694
I was so embarrassed...

928
01:11:57,404 --> 01:12:01,874
because I was such a burden...

929
01:12:09,584 --> 01:12:11,654
Stop it!

930
01:12:12,514 --> 01:12:13,514
Jesus...

931
01:12:15,304 --> 01:12:17,174
When did you wake up?

932
01:12:17,844 --> 01:12:19,264
Oh man...

933
01:12:21,054 --> 01:12:22,554
I'm so sorry!

934
01:12:24,384 --> 01:12:25,134
Stop crying!

935
01:12:35,034 --> 01:12:36,054
A few days ago,

936
01:12:36,544 --> 01:12:39,574
these goddamn cats fied
after getting beaten up by Su-kang.

937
01:12:39,964 --> 01:12:41,724
They're actually hiding
in our school.

938
01:12:41,824 --> 01:12:43,574
Cooperate with us in finding them.

939
01:12:43,744 --> 01:12:45,784
Anyone who has factial bruise,

940
01:12:45,914 --> 01:12:48,374
cuts or gauze on their arms
is the cat.

941
01:12:48,574 --> 01:12:50,414
FYI, there are at least 2 cats.

942
01:12:50,414 --> 01:12:53,994
If you help us catch them,
you'll get a lifetime free pass.

943
01:12:54,034 --> 01:12:58,174
But you're dead if you help them.

944
01:12:58,304 --> 01:13:01,264
Roll up your sleeves!

945
01:13:02,514 --> 01:13:04,184
Roll up, asshole!

946
01:13:07,514 --> 01:13:08,834
Roll up!

947
01:13:09,524 --> 01:13:13,064
What are you waiting for?
Roll up, bitch!

948
01:13:14,734 --> 01:13:15,904
Did you check him?

949
01:13:15,904 --> 01:13:17,404
- I did, I did.
- Yeah?

950
01:13:17,404 --> 01:13:20,034
- Hurry up and roll up!
- Did you check this guy?

951
01:13:21,114 --> 01:13:23,534
- Roll up, asshole!
- Was it you? Bullshit!

952
01:13:26,584 --> 01:13:27,954
It's not me!

953
01:13:28,204 --> 01:13:29,374
It hurts, stop it!

954
01:13:29,494 --> 01:13:31,084
- Shut the hell up!
- Stop it!

955
01:13:31,714 --> 01:13:34,024
What gives you the right
to terrorize the school?

956
01:13:34,174 --> 01:13:35,754
Are there no rules here?

957
01:13:39,754 --> 01:13:42,174
You were the ones
who got beaten up!

958
01:13:42,424 --> 01:13:44,304
All of this is because
you're embarrassed!

959
01:13:48,434 --> 01:13:51,184
We're looking for the cat
because of bitches like you.

960
01:13:52,184 --> 01:13:56,694
I'm going to kill him
to bring your sense track.

961
01:13:59,734 --> 01:14:02,264
Do-hoo! What's going on?!

962
01:14:12,054 --> 01:14:13,474
if the cat doesn't come forward,

963
01:14:14,354 --> 01:14:18,854
or if no one tips him off,

964
01:14:19,684 --> 01:14:24,174
Got that?!

965
01:14:27,284 --> 01:14:28,574
Mr. So?

966
01:14:31,174 --> 01:14:32,854
Yes, did you ask for me?

967
01:14:41,014 --> 01:14:44,054
This is a secret,
so don't act surprised.

968
01:14:45,174 --> 01:14:48,004
You'll be approved
as full-time factually.

969
01:14:50,024 --> 01:14:52,454
Congrats, you deserve it.

970
01:14:55,684 --> 01:14:57,144
Are you sure?

971
01:14:58,574 --> 01:14:59,624
Thank you...

972
01:14:59,814 --> 01:15:00,984
No need to thank me.

973
01:15:02,284 --> 01:15:04,634
Thank you, Ms. Lee,
thank you...

974
01:15:04,754 --> 01:15:06,844
Thank you, Ms. Lee,
thank you...

975
01:15:07,054 --> 01:15:08,174
Thank you, thank you...

976
01:15:12,024 --> 01:15:17,154
Ms. Yao, I'll do your part as well.

977
01:15:18,224 --> 01:15:20,804
SO SI-MIN
I can be a good teacher.

978
01:15:28,124 --> 01:15:31,744
We searched everyone
taller than 175cm,

979
01:15:32,174 --> 01:15:34,054
but none of them had a cut.

980
01:15:35,314 --> 01:15:36,264
You sure?

981
01:15:36,444 --> 01:15:38,894
He's not an athlete
or a brawler.

982
01:15:39,014 --> 01:15:39,974
Dammit...

983
01:15:41,984 --> 01:15:44,154
We even searched the wimps.

984
01:15:44,154 --> 01:15:46,784
Shit, this is so weird...

985
01:15:50,604 --> 01:15:53,374
- Ms. So! Morning!
- Hi there!

986
01:16:08,094 --> 01:16:09,304
Bingo.

987
01:16:19,104 --> 01:16:19,984
Kwon-joong.

988
01:16:20,404 --> 01:16:21,314
Hey.

989
01:16:22,654 --> 01:16:24,654
I'm gonna be a full-timer!

990
01:16:24,654 --> 01:16:27,614
Seriously! Congrats!

991
01:16:27,694 --> 01:16:30,114
You're gonna be a teacher!

992
01:16:30,204 --> 01:16:31,784
I'll call you right back.

993
01:16:42,014 --> 01:16:44,594
Found you, kitty cat.

994
01:16:47,384 --> 01:16:48,514
Meow.

995
01:16:56,224 --> 01:16:57,564
What did you say?

996
01:17:02,024 --> 01:17:03,694
It was weird.

997
01:17:04,914 --> 01:17:07,874
The cat took the blow
that was meant for me.

998
01:17:08,244 --> 01:17:10,074
Why throw yourself to save me?

999
01:17:10,474 --> 01:17:13,144
You were trying to save
Kimbap, not me.

1000
01:17:13,524 --> 01:17:16,444
Because stabbing me
would blow this up.

1001
01:17:19,734 --> 01:17:21,274
Let go of me!

1002
01:17:22,814 --> 01:17:25,404
Sounds like you managed to
become a full-timer.

1003
01:17:25,424 --> 01:17:26,584
Pity...

1004
01:17:30,674 --> 01:17:32,254
What are you doing?!

1005
01:17:33,974 --> 01:17:36,224
I could kill you right here...

1006
01:17:36,814 --> 01:17:38,354
but that wouldn't be fun.

1007
01:17:44,234 --> 01:17:45,194
Han Su-kang!

1008
01:17:50,694 --> 01:17:53,574
How does it feel
to put on the hobo hat?

1009
01:17:56,204 --> 01:17:58,334
MOOYOUNG HIGH FESTIVAL

1010
01:18:02,874 --> 01:18:04,874
I'm having so much fun for once.

1011
01:18:09,754 --> 01:18:10,754
All right.

1012
01:18:12,344 --> 01:18:13,854
One of us must die.

1013
01:18:15,394 --> 01:18:17,054
Let's have a match
during the festival.

1014
01:18:18,084 --> 01:18:20,294
A deathmatch in the ring!

1015
01:18:21,684 --> 01:18:23,104
What do you...

1016
01:18:23,444 --> 01:18:25,824
Remember Kimbap's knife video?

1017
01:18:26,074 --> 01:18:28,494
If you don't come to the ring,

1018
01:18:29,224 --> 01:18:33,184
I'll play that here, spread it online,
and report it to the police.

1019
01:18:33,494 --> 01:18:35,954
My boys edited it to perfection.

1020
01:18:39,514 --> 01:18:41,304
Su-kang, this is not a game.

1021
01:18:41,584 --> 01:18:43,134
Let me ask you one thing.

1022
01:18:43,644 --> 01:18:44,666
Do you really not feel

1023
01:18:46,691 --> 01:18:48,638
a hint of remorse?

1024
01:18:50,374 --> 01:18:53,004
Do you still think
I'm on the same level as you?

1025
01:18:53,324 --> 01:18:56,374
Born a beggar,
die a beggar.

1026
01:18:59,354 --> 01:19:02,434
You're just a pension pest.
Know your place.

1027
01:19:26,874 --> 01:19:28,124
Greet the teacher.

1028
01:19:28,214 --> 01:19:30,634
- Good morning.
- Hey there.

1029
01:19:42,064 --> 01:19:44,354
TRANSFER REQUEST

1030
01:19:47,354 --> 01:19:49,104
SORA APARTMENT

1031
01:20:01,064 --> 01:20:02,174
Anyone home?

1032
01:20:03,994 --> 01:20:05,164
Who is it?

1033
01:20:05,514 --> 01:20:06,974
Good afternoon.

1034
01:20:07,024 --> 01:20:10,034
I'm Jin-hyung's teacher,
So Si-min.

1035
01:20:11,294 --> 01:20:12,294
Oh, hello...

1036
01:20:14,384 --> 01:20:20,014
Granny, do you remember me?

1037
01:20:20,764 --> 01:20:21,974
Oh gosh!

1038
01:20:22,384 --> 01:20:24,184
My god, miss...

1039
01:20:25,034 --> 01:20:28,624
That angel of a woman
was my boy's teacher?

1040
01:20:30,484 --> 01:20:34,154
Miss, please save Jin-hyung.

1041
01:20:35,394 --> 01:20:41,394
He puts up with all kinds of trouble
at school to protect me.

1042
01:20:42,654 --> 01:20:48,164
I'm unable to protect my child,
I'm only a burden...

1043
01:20:50,854 --> 01:20:53,934
You don't mean that, ma'am.

1044
01:20:54,434 --> 01:20:56,564
One moment, please.

1045
01:21:06,824 --> 01:21:07,994
This is...

1046
01:21:11,484 --> 01:21:14,404
the only thing I can give you.

1047
01:21:16,574 --> 01:21:19,364
Please save my boy.

1048
01:21:22,284 --> 01:21:25,034
Thank you, I'll eat them all.

1049
01:21:36,964 --> 01:21:38,004
Jin-hyung!

1050
01:21:40,784 --> 01:21:43,244
You asked me to save you.

1051
01:21:45,394 --> 01:21:48,644
You worked up the courage
to open up to me...

1052
01:21:50,564 --> 01:21:52,484
I feel so ashamed.

1053
01:21:53,184 --> 01:21:55,564
I'm sorry, Jin-hyung.

1054
01:21:55,924 --> 01:21:59,804
I couldn't think of anything
I did wrong,

1055
01:22:01,514 --> 01:22:03,554
so I asked him why.

1056
01:22:03,674 --> 01:22:05,424
What did I do so wrong?

1057
01:22:07,664 --> 01:22:11,044
He said it was for fun...

1058
01:22:11,914 --> 01:22:12,624
Wait...

1059
01:22:30,854 --> 01:22:32,314
Grandma! Grandma!

1060
01:22:33,434 --> 01:22:35,774
Stop it! Stop!

1061
01:22:36,944 --> 01:22:38,404
- Are you okay?
- My baby...

1062
01:22:39,444 --> 01:22:43,034
- You okay? Let's go home.
- Jin-hyung, thank god...

1063
01:22:43,424 --> 01:22:45,964
Don't do this, please!

1064
01:22:47,244 --> 01:22:48,914
Don't do it!

1065
01:22:50,544 --> 01:22:52,084
That's enough.

1066
01:22:53,084 --> 01:22:54,294
I won't let you be!

1067
01:22:54,584 --> 01:22:56,424
This is so fucking fun.

1068
01:22:59,044 --> 01:23:02,544
- Die, asshole!
- You won't do what?

1069
01:23:02,564 --> 01:23:04,894
- Die, asshole!
- You won't do that?

1070
01:23:09,304 --> 01:23:11,504
I'll do whatever you ask...

1071
01:23:15,334 --> 01:23:20,274
Su-kang, I'll do whatever you ask.

1072
01:23:20,934 --> 01:23:24,854
So please don't harass my grandma.

1073
01:23:25,474 --> 01:23:27,274
I'm begging you...

1074
01:23:27,824 --> 01:23:28,634
Yeah?

1075
01:23:30,594 --> 01:23:32,884
You should eat that first.

1076
01:23:33,744 --> 01:23:36,914
Are you gonna waste
your granny's precious food?

1077
01:23:44,344 --> 01:23:45,414
Yo. Retard

1078
01:23:47,604 --> 01:23:48,954
You just graduated.

1079
01:23:49,364 --> 01:23:50,704
Ko Jin-hyung is our bitch now.

1080
01:23:50,704 --> 01:23:53,584
Let's take a graduation photo,
say cheese.

1081
01:23:54,084 --> 01:23:55,834
You're now called 'Kimbap'.

1082
01:23:56,024 --> 01:23:59,714
Disobey me even once,
we'll bury your grandma.

1083
01:24:09,194 --> 01:24:11,944
I hurt someone with this hand.

1084
01:24:15,114 --> 01:24:17,534
I have to protect my grandma.

1085
01:24:19,474 --> 01:24:21,594
She's the only one I have...

1086
01:24:22,554 --> 01:24:25,644
What did I do so wrong?

1087
01:24:32,214 --> 01:24:34,134
You didn't do anything wrong.

1088
01:24:35,264 --> 01:24:38,314
That man you hurt is fine.

1089
01:24:39,724 --> 01:24:44,274
And you've protected
your grandma so well.

1090
01:24:45,794 --> 01:24:47,554
You did good, Jin-hyung.

1091
01:24:50,174 --> 01:24:51,224
Let's...

1092
01:24:54,294 --> 01:24:55,424
win.

1093
01:24:57,544 --> 01:24:59,424
Please come to the festival.

1094
01:25:19,094 --> 01:25:23,514
IF YOU DO NOTHING,
NOTHING WILL HAPPEN

1095
01:25:24,144 --> 01:25:27,234
Mooyoung High,
it's festival day!

1096
01:25:33,284 --> 01:25:34,864
Su-kang invited the cat?

1097
01:25:35,224 --> 01:25:38,354
FIGHTER OF DEATH HAN SU-KANG VS. FACELESS KITTY

1098
01:25:35,224 --> 01:25:37,554
is the cat really coming?

1099
01:25:39,354 --> 01:25:40,644
One sec...

1100
01:25:45,764 --> 01:25:48,474
WE ARE THE CAT

1101
01:25:48,634 --> 01:25:52,854
Darkness cannot trump light!

1102
01:25:55,394 --> 01:25:58,484
Guys, we're the cat, okay?
We're the cat.

1103
01:25:58,484 --> 01:26:00,864
- Did you make this?
- Yeah, I made them all.

1104
01:26:00,864 --> 01:26:02,784
- Really?
- Put them on and walk around, okay?

1105
01:26:02,904 --> 01:26:05,614
- Guys, over here!
- Come take these.

1106
01:26:06,494 --> 01:26:07,954
We're the cat, got it?

1107
01:26:09,164 --> 01:26:10,624
Walk around with this.

1108
01:26:10,624 --> 01:26:12,794
Cheer for the cat!

1109
01:26:12,794 --> 01:26:14,914
You look good,
take these.

1110
01:26:17,464 --> 01:26:18,544
Keep them on.

1111
01:26:18,924 --> 01:26:19,504
Si-min!

1112
01:26:21,634 --> 01:26:23,154
Mr. Suh, why are you...

1113
01:26:23,374 --> 01:26:24,294
Good luck!

1114
01:26:24,844 --> 01:26:27,844
Mr. So!
Byung-jin, what's all this?

1115
01:26:28,034 --> 01:26:29,244
You're not alone.

1116
01:26:30,014 --> 01:26:32,974
I prepped this with Mr. Suh
to show our support.

1117
01:26:35,304 --> 01:26:36,734
I called the police that right,

1118
01:26:37,214 --> 01:26:38,944
and spread the news about the cat.

1119
01:26:39,354 --> 01:26:41,154
I know how Jin-hyung feels.

1120
01:26:41,944 --> 01:26:45,484
I was Han's target
just before him.

1121
01:26:47,694 --> 01:26:49,654
I'm just as bad as Han.

1122
01:26:50,784 --> 01:26:52,334
I was selfish.

1123
01:26:55,754 --> 01:26:57,174
Please help, miss.

1124
01:26:59,004 --> 01:27:01,384
Please win today.
My hero!

1125
01:27:09,934 --> 01:27:14,274
We'll now begin Mooyoung High's
38th School Festival!

1126
01:27:46,464 --> 01:27:49,054
Heard you're joining the faculty!

1127
01:27:49,054 --> 01:27:50,054
Ma'am?

1128
01:27:50,684 --> 01:27:52,224
Your dream came true.

1129
01:27:52,554 --> 01:27:54,014
Yes, finally.

1130
01:27:54,854 --> 01:27:57,574
Thank you, I'll do my best.

1131
01:28:01,024 --> 01:28:05,124
Is the fight between Han
and the cat approved?

1132
01:28:05,154 --> 01:28:07,414
The vice principal approved it!

1133
01:28:07,464 --> 01:28:09,364
Really? Who'll win?

1134
01:28:09,364 --> 01:28:11,494
Will the cat even show up?

1135
01:28:12,604 --> 01:28:13,644
Meow.

1136
01:28:14,164 --> 01:28:16,624
I hope the cat shows up.

1137
01:28:18,874 --> 01:28:19,504
Pardon?

1138
01:28:19,834 --> 01:28:23,504
The cat reminds me
of my younger, courageous self.

1139
01:29:25,194 --> 01:29:26,404
You know my life philosophy,

1140
01:29:26,584 --> 01:29:27,824
'It's a loss to intervene.'

1141
01:29:27,824 --> 01:29:30,364
I'll aggressively hold back.

1142
01:29:37,204 --> 01:29:38,624
Please fogive me.

1143
01:29:38,624 --> 01:29:40,294
I'm so sorry, ma'am!

1144
01:29:40,294 --> 01:29:41,914
On-site education!

1145
01:29:41,914 --> 01:29:43,004
Educating hooligans

1146
01:29:43,004 --> 01:29:45,044
Su-kang, this is not a game.

1147
01:29:45,044 --> 01:29:46,674
I feel so ashamed.

1148
01:29:46,674 --> 01:29:48,384
Let's win.

1149
01:29:49,554 --> 01:29:52,384
If you do nothing,
nothing will happen!

1150
01:30:37,644 --> 01:30:40,264
Han Su-kang! Han Su-kang!

1151
01:30:40,514 --> 01:30:42,604
Where's the cat?
Come on out!

1152
01:30:42,684 --> 01:30:45,354
Kitty cat! Kitty cat!

1153
01:30:53,714 --> 01:30:54,974
This is the beginning.

1154
01:30:57,084 --> 01:30:59,744
This is my life's
ultimate championship.

1155
01:31:06,624 --> 01:31:08,624
- Su-kang's here!
- There he is!

1156
01:31:29,454 --> 01:31:33,794
Han Su-kang! Han Su-kang!

1157
01:31:40,114 --> 01:31:41,574
A gift from Kwon-joong.

1158
01:31:41,924 --> 01:31:44,984
Kwon-joong, that punk...

1159
01:32:14,374 --> 01:32:16,794
Don't ever take your mask off!

1160
01:32:56,624 --> 01:32:59,004
Kitty cat! Kitty cat!

1161
01:33:33,814 --> 01:33:35,314
Get it together!

1162
01:33:46,394 --> 01:33:47,484
Si-min!

1163
01:34:20,904 --> 01:34:22,654
- It was a woman?
- A female cat!

1164
01:34:22,654 --> 01:34:25,364
- A girl?
- Men can have long hair...

1165
01:34:49,144 --> 01:34:54,184
Kitty cat! Kitty cat!

1166
01:34:55,144 --> 01:34:56,814
We have to stop this!

1167
01:34:59,194 --> 01:35:00,734
Get up, bitch!

1168
01:35:26,884 --> 01:35:28,634
Should I take it off or not?

1169
01:35:28,854 --> 01:35:31,234
Should I fool around a bit more?

1170
01:35:32,144 --> 01:35:33,894
Taking it off
will risk your career.

1171
01:35:34,014 --> 01:35:35,394
Su-kang, rip her to shreds!

1172
01:35:35,604 --> 01:35:37,564
Answer me, bitch!

1173
01:35:37,644 --> 01:35:40,774
- Miss! You can do it! Get up!
- Hang in there...

1174
01:35:40,814 --> 01:35:43,484
Just stop it, you bastard!

1175
01:35:53,054 --> 01:35:54,844
Goddamn, nobody!

1176
01:35:55,334 --> 01:35:57,744
Get the hell up, bitch!

1177
01:36:01,924 --> 01:36:06,094
I'm all right, Jin-hyung,
I'm not giving up.

1178
01:36:28,194 --> 01:36:29,484
Boss, behind you!

1179
01:36:52,974 --> 01:36:53,884
Come on!

1180
01:37:03,404 --> 01:37:07,444
Kitty cat! Kitty cat!

1181
01:37:16,324 --> 01:37:18,164
I'm gonna make you kneel.

1182
01:37:18,834 --> 01:37:22,914
You won't ever stand up
before students you harassed!

1183
01:37:23,214 --> 01:37:24,544
Just watch.

1184
01:37:25,134 --> 01:37:29,714
I'll show you who you'll kneel to.

1185
01:37:36,714 --> 01:37:38,514
Don't take it off!

1186
01:37:39,324 --> 01:37:41,374
Don't!

1187
01:37:46,904 --> 01:37:47,654
No!

1188
01:38:01,744 --> 01:38:04,544
- Ms. So Si-min!
- Ms. So!

1189
01:38:15,594 --> 01:38:16,934
Miss!

1190
01:38:16,974 --> 01:38:18,474
Snap out of it!

1191
01:38:18,474 --> 01:38:19,934
I don't care!

1192
01:38:20,264 --> 01:38:22,394
Han Su-kang, get wrecked!

1193
01:38:22,854 --> 01:38:24,314
So Si-min!

1194
01:38:24,644 --> 01:38:30,364
So Si-min! So Si-min!

1195
01:38:30,644 --> 01:38:33,434
So Si-min! So Si-min!

1196
01:38:33,944 --> 01:38:37,154
So Si-min! So Si-min!

1197
01:38:37,324 --> 01:38:40,124
So Si-min! So Si-min!

1198
01:39:03,064 --> 01:39:04,974
I'll pay you back in full.

1199
01:39:29,794 --> 01:39:31,004
Make way!

1200
01:39:31,004 --> 01:39:31,844
Teachers!

1201
01:39:39,264 --> 01:39:40,514
Got you!

1202
01:39:57,904 --> 01:39:59,364
Shit...

1203
01:40:04,414 --> 01:40:07,004
- Vice principal! Stop the fight!
- Yes, sir!

1204
01:40:07,084 --> 01:40:12,004
- Ms... Ms. So!
- Sir, you approved this!

1205
01:40:12,004 --> 01:40:14,504
Ms. So! That's enough!

1206
01:40:14,594 --> 01:40:16,914
Ms. So! Stop it!

1207
01:40:17,584 --> 01:40:19,954
What are you doing
to a student?

1208
01:40:20,054 --> 01:40:21,054
Get down now!

1209
01:40:21,184 --> 01:40:24,514
If not, I'm voiding your
full-time teacher appointment!

1210
01:40:24,514 --> 01:40:27,184
Shut up, vice! Piss off!

1211
01:40:27,914 --> 01:40:33,234
Don't get in the way.
I'm gonna kill this fucking bitch.

1212
01:40:33,324 --> 01:40:36,984
Even if I kill you,
nothing will happen to me. Why?

1213
01:40:37,144 --> 01:40:39,824
Because this is a fair match!

1214
01:40:41,784 --> 01:40:43,984
I'll show you it's legal

1215
01:40:45,374 --> 01:40:47,544
to kill someone,
you hobo bitch.

1216
01:41:00,884 --> 01:41:02,974
Get the school nurse! Hurry!

1217
01:41:03,304 --> 01:41:05,014
Fucking moron.

1218
01:41:38,424 --> 01:41:39,554
Dammit...

1219
01:41:46,514 --> 01:41:48,894
Bam!

1220
01:42:06,164 --> 01:42:09,914
I'll make him apologize to you.

1221
01:42:15,424 --> 01:42:17,544
I'll get him to kneel...

1222
01:42:20,754 --> 01:42:21,804
before you.

1223
01:43:37,164 --> 01:43:39,374
Apologize to Jin-hyung.

1224
01:43:40,044 --> 01:43:42,674
You're not human
If you don't feel remorse.

1225
01:43:43,344 --> 01:43:45,304
You're a danger to society.

1226
01:43:45,714 --> 01:43:48,804
Apologize for your sake.

1227
01:43:54,454 --> 01:43:56,294
Fuck you, assole.

1228
01:43:57,644 --> 01:43:59,814
I don't need your apology.

1229
01:44:00,224 --> 01:44:04,694
You've already lost to everyone.

1230
01:44:05,904 --> 01:44:07,444
Go to hell.

1231
01:44:19,414 --> 01:44:21,464
Motherfucker...

1232
01:44:22,124 --> 01:44:23,504
Out of the way!

1233
01:44:26,254 --> 01:44:27,514
Get over here, fucking bitch!

1234
01:44:28,634 --> 01:44:30,474
Die, asshole!

1235
01:45:14,844 --> 01:45:18,264
Do you wish to press charges
against perpetrator Han Su-kang?

1236
01:45:18,354 --> 01:45:20,474
Yes, I do.

1237
01:45:38,484 --> 01:45:40,404
I'm here to file a report!

1238
01:45:45,624 --> 01:45:49,414
I have videos of school violence.

1239
01:45:52,754 --> 01:45:55,574
In the recent school violence incident..

1240
01:45:55,594 --> 01:45:59,284
Han and several minors have been implicated.

1241
01:45:59,944 --> 01:46:02,274
The police made an arrest
this morning.

1242
01:46:02,294 --> 01:46:06,424
The police are reinvestigating Han
and his involvement in the suicide of

1243
01:46:06,474 --> 01:46:08,274
contract teacher Yoo a year ago.

1244
01:46:08,274 --> 01:46:10,984
Do you acknowledge the sexual assault charges?

1245
01:46:11,154 --> 01:46:13,944
is it true that you were involved
in hiring of the faculty?

1246
01:46:14,074 --> 01:46:15,954
Why did you do it?

1247
01:46:17,454 --> 01:46:19,454
Because it's fun.

1248
01:46:19,584 --> 01:46:22,244
Any intention to apologize to your victims?

1249
01:46:23,584 --> 01:46:24,674
Why should I?

1250

is my desire to impart
the power of love
