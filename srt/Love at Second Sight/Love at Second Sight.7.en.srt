Nan.

Yes?

17
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,640
What do you think of this tie?

18
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:26,240
Nice.

19
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,480
I have something for you.

What?

21
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,800
Ta-da.

24
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,040
Look.

25
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,880
With our names

26
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,680
on them.

27

One for you and the other for me.

28
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,520
Then you and I would never break up.

29
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,840
Do keep it very carefully.

30
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:52,520
By the way,

31
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,440
don't drink too much at dinner.

32
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,200
One has to drink in social activities.

33
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,360
But it does harm to your health.

34
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,360
Don't worry, Nan.

00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:03,880
Now,

36
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,040
I have to work harder.

37
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,800
Then after graduation,

38
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,360
we don't need to struggle for a living.

39
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,520
Don't be silly.

00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,400
not your money.

42
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,160

Why did you appear like a shadow?

59

Nonsense.

60
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,120
What did you come here for?

61
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,400
For a school reunion.

62
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,240
And you?

63
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:35,920
For a meeting.

64
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,560
Last night,

65
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:44,960
I was drunk.

66
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,720
Someone told me

67
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,840
you sent me back to my room.

68
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,760
Song Cenmo told you, huh?

69
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,160
You didn't do anything to me, did you?

70
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,200
What are you talking about?

71
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,280
It's you who...

72
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,360
What?

73
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,960
You were drunk last night.

74
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,120
I had the security guard send you back.

75
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,120
Then,

76
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,640
Song Cenmo came.

77
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,400
You're done talking, huh?

78
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,040
I should go, then.

79
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,600
You're an adult.

80
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,600
Why didn't you watch your step?

81
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:39,800
Let me check your feet.

82
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:40,680
They're fine.

83
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,080
What?

84
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,600
Sorry.

85
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,560
Let's come here again next time.

86
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:07,800
OK.

87
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:08,640
Sounds good.

88
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:10,480
Su Nan!

89
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:13,880
Gu Yibei?

90
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,400
You girls should walk carefully

91
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,160
in case you fall into the water.

92
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,080
What's all this about?

93
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,760
Why could you meet Gu Yibei everywhere

94
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,160
after you came to Xi'an?

95
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,880
You would even

96
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,720
make Xi'an a city of romance.

97
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,560
Nonsense.

98
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
I don't know why he came here.

99
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,880
I even saw you hug each other

100
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,120
and you were soaked through.

101
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,440
Were you

102
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,600
having a date in the garden?

103
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,120
Not at all!

104
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,640
I was taking a selfie by the river

105
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,680
when he suddenly appeared
out of nowhere.

106
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:17,640
And then?

107
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,760
Then, I fell into the water

108
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,240
and he got me out of it.

109
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,480
In this life,

110
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,760
you two

111
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,840
would always stick together.

112
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,320
What are you talking about?

113
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,160
Beat him!

114
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,240
Yibei!

115
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,000
Stop it!

116
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:52,840
Get out!

117
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:53,440
Get out!

118
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,120
Yibei.

119
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,480
Pay off the debt,
or I would come every day.

120
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,040
Yibei.

121
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,600
Put those things down.

122
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,400
Take them away.

123
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:00,800
Come on.

124
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,640
Get up, Yibei.

125
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:02,880
Are you OK?

126
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:06,120
Put them down!

127
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:06,600
Get out!

128
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,240
Take all the things away!

129
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:07,880
Go.

130
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:08,560
Go!

131
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,560
Take them away.

132
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,680
And you...

133
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,560
