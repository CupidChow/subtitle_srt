Give it to me.

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,600
What?

18
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:47,920
My phone.

19
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,000
Phone?

20
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,400
Didn't you come to return my phone?

21
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,240
Oh, oops.

22
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,200
I forgot to bring it.

23
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,880
You did?

24
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,640
Then what did you come for?

25
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,400
I...

26
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:02,680
I...

27
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,560
My company,

28
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,640
Weiyi Technology,

29
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,200
is in this building.

30
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,600
If you need anything, come at any time.

31
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:11,920
Yibei.

32
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,040
Remember to bring me the phone tomorrow.

33
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,480
Yibei,

34
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,480
there you are.

35
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,120
This is

36
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,440
the business report of this month.

37
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:30,280
Check it out.

38
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,760
Sign it if you confirm.

39
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,760
Ms. Jiang asked to see you.

40
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,480
Go to her office.

41
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,160
Go.

42
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:16,240
Ms. Jiang.

43
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,280
Ms. Jiang.

44
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,120
You came late on your first day to work.

45
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,160
If you don't want the job,
you shouldn't have applied.

46
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,560
You wasted our time, energy,

47
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,440
and even lives.

48
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,120
I'm sorry, Ms. Jiang.

49
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,160
Something held me up today.

50
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,520
I promise I won't be late anymore.

51
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,720
This month,

52
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,680
you'll have no bonus for full attendance.

53
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:47,840
You know what?

54
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,240
In terms of major, diploma, or experience,

55
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,320
you aren't as good as other applicants.

56
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,280
Why did I pick you?

57
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:56,520
Have you thought about it?

58
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,200
Because you're single.

59
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,320
You're the only single applicant.

60
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,600
That's why you're hired.

61
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,920
You have to know

62
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,400
you're quite lucky

63
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,920
to work in my company,

64
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,200
considering your qualification.

65
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,240
Do you know what you should do?

66
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,360
Only single people

67
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,880
can put all their time and energy

68
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,200
into their work.

69
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,880
They won't be distracted or hampered.

70
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,320
Do you get it?

71
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,360
Ye...

72
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:29,880
Yes.

73
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,520
Get out.

74
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,320
Convenient connections are
the advantage of full-scene application.

75
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,080
Users don't need to
frequently switch the apps.

76
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,480
For developers like us,

77
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,240
using the lowest cost

78
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,320
to make the most promising product

79
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,960
is a good way to maximize our output.

80
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,200
Good point.

81
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,600
During the software development,

82
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,520
we should also
enter the hardware market.

83
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,000
Hardware?

84
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,160
Only the connection
of software and hardware

85
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,840
can make our product
closest to perfection.

86
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,560
How about we have a deep cooperation

87
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,440
with a hardware manufacturer

88
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,800
who has mature technology?

89
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,280
As a startup company,

90
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,800
we have to develop through risks.

91
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,960
In the very beginning,

92
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,720
are you scared already?

93
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:22,640
Yibei,

94
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,040
I just think we should advance steadily.

95
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,560
If we advance too fast...

96
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,520
What would happen?

97
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,080
We might easily fail.

98
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:33,960
Don't worry.

99
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,760
We can start

100
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:39,640
with phones and computers.

101
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,000
We have fully independent
intellectual property.

102
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,920
Our company

103
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,720
doesn't need any guide.

104
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:46,760
We are

105
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,880
the bellwether.

106
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:12,040
(Gu Yibei,)

107
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,880
(I can hardly)

108
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,320
(forget you.)

109
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,760
If I hadn't met you,

110
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,680
I'm afraid you would keep my phone

111
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,600
instead of giving it back.

112
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,800
How do you have the nerve to come?

113
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,560
You texted me to break up

114
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:57,800
and then you disappeared.

115
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,480
How do you have the nerve to come?

116
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,840
You know what?

117
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,360
This isn't where you can come or leave

118
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,760
just as you wish!

119
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,480
Yibei.

120
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,200
You're really weird lately.

121
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,760
A package for you.
