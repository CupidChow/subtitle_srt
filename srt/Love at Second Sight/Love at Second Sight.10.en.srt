Gu Yibei, what are you doing?

17
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,280
Why?

18
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,160
What do you want, Gu Yibei?

19
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:30,520
You...

20
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:31,760
Why?

21
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,360
Why didn't you tell me
we work in the same building?

22
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,320
Now you know it anyway.

23
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:48,520
What?

24
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:50,320
How did you get this photo?

25
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,000
Don't bother about this.

26
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,160
Who's this man?

27
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,640
Gu Yibei, this is creepy!

28
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:56,960
Psychopath.

29
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,080
Su Nan,

30
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,840
go get my pants from my office.

31
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,560
I won't.

32
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:29,440
Su Nan,

33
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,960
if anyone sees us,

34
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,080
it's not good.

35
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,040
It's not good for you, I guess.

36
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,120
You're the new technology elite

37
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,080
and the elected lady killer
on the forum.

38
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,680
I'm nobody and I'm not scared.

39
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,480
Su Nan!

40
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:51,880
Pretty.

41
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,320
Su Nan,

42
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,880
this is a different case.

43
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,280
Could you please get my pants first?

44
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,320
Mr. Gu,

45
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,560
you can call Song Cenmo

46
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,520
or your secretary.

47
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,880
Or anyone else.

48
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,200
Goodbye, Mr. Gu.

49
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:30,840
Su Nan.

50
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,480
You're one minute late.

51
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,120
Sorry, Ms. Jiang.

52
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,320
Su Nan,

53
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,520
good job on the water cooler.

54
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,720
Yibei.

55
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:02,840
Yibei?

56
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,400
Gu Yibei!

57
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,360
What do you want me for?

58
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:11,920
Where are my pants?

59
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,120
Pants?

60
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:14,280
What pants?

61
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,760
Then why did you come up?

62
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,760
Because you asked me to come up.

63
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,520
So weird.

64
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,760
I didn't want to come.

65
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,000
Oh my God.

66
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,840
What did I see?

67
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,200
Tell me.

68
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,600
What did you just do with Su Nan?

69
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,320
Confess.

70
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,120
I warn you.

71
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,120
Su Nan is your ex-girlfriend.

72
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,880
But

73
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,000
you still can't do that.

74
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,320
That is a crime.

75
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,040
You get it wrong.

76
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,040
So, you're the victim?

77
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,640
Seriously?

78
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,840
Su Nan...

79
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,680
Was she that eager?

80
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,120
Go get me a pair of pants now.

81
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,520
Where can I get the pants?

82
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,120
What about I buy a pair for you?

83
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,000
Stop.

84
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,240
What again?

85
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,000
Hey, wait, wait.

86
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,400
Come on.

87
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,160
Let me take a photo first.

88
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,720
One more photo.

89
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,800
What a great chance! One more time.

90
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,080
Stop it and go away.

91
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,240
You owe me this.

92
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,080
Come on. Let me help.

93
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,800
Cover your hips.

94
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:40,800
Not covered again.

95
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,560
Stop touching.

96
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,560
What are you waiting for?
Go get the tool.

97
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,040
This?

98
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:01,760
Do it.

99
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,920
Will this work?

100
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,120
Move up.

101
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,640
Hurry.

102
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:20,840
Yibei.

103
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,080
Hi.

104
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,680
Oh, I should go.

105
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,520
I'll leave.

106
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,240
It's not what you think it is.

107
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,160
What were you...

108
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,240
doing?

109
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:44,520
What?

110
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,200
Put your pants on first.

111
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,520
Yaru,

112
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,200
let's get to business.

113
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,560
Are you sure?

114
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,520
Yes.

115
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,800
Tianshi Group has been expanding
through acquisitions.

116
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:12,720
So far,

117
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,800
it's highly advantageous
in market share and assets.

118
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,560
But technology is

119
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,640
the only advantage of our company.

120
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:20,680
So,

121
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,800
I don't suggest a lateral expansion now.

122
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,360
The proposal of the product

123
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,560
will be issued next week.

124
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,440
You...

125
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,040
Review it carefully

126
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:30,880
and give me some advice.

127
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,320
Fine.

128
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,400
You call the shots, Mr. Gu.

129
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,600
Forget what I just said.

130
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:43,640
How about

131
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,120
you get back and check it?

132
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,120
Oh, yes.

133
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,960
I... I've got work to do.

134
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,320
I should go.

135
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:12,880
Jia,

136
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,280
may I ask you a question?

137
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:15,680
OK.

138
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,520
If someone takes photos of you secretly,

139
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,640
what can be the reason?

140
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,400
It's clear.

141
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,760
He must be a freak stalker.

142
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,440
What? Someone stalked you?

143
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,080
Gu Yibei took photos of me
downstairs of my company.

144
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,680
Eww.

145
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:33,200
That's creepy.

146
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,480
Why did he do that?

147
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,320
Was he really irritated?

148
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,360
Then you must protect yourself.

149
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,520
But speaking of that,

150
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,160
he was irritated because you broke up.

151
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,120
He's a man

152
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,000
stuck in lovesickness.

153
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,720
I don't know what to do.

154
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,000
I can see that.

155
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,840
You worry about him

156
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,080
but also want to avoid him.

157
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,040

158
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,800
