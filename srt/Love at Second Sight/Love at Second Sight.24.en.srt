Tianshi Group has decided
to acquire Weiyi Technology.

You are the one
who secretly manipulated it all?

00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:24,000
Thanks to your trust in me.

73
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,360
The final decision is still in your hands.

74
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,680
Me and Su Nan,

75
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,560
make a choice.

76
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,760
If you pick me,

77
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,240
I will terminate

To operate Weiyi Technology together.

81
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,440
If you pick Su Nan,

82
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,840
then there will be

83
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,640
no Mr. Gu in the future.

This project is indeed very promising,
