Today,

17
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,160
why are you available?

18
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,360
Not going out with Yaru?

19
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,120
If I did,
I wouldn't have a spare moment.

20

I love spare moments alone.

00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,520
Wow.

22
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:34,760
Nice play.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,400
Mr. Kang.

24
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:38,760
There you are.

25
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,120
Come on.

26
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:41,080
Let me introduce you guys.

27
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,920
This is Mr. Gu Yibei.

28
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,040
The new elite of IT Industry

29
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,360
and boss of Weiyi Technology.

30
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,480
This is Mr. Xu Zhaolin,

31
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,000
young master of Dongye Group.

32
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,600
Get to know each other.

33
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,320
Have good cooperation when possible.

34
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,160
Nice to meet you, Mr. Gu.

35
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:12,400
What?

36
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,160
How did you get this photo?

37
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,160
Don't bother about this.

38
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:16,880
Who's this man?

39
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,560
(Oh, no.)

40
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,320
And this one.

41
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,600
Miss Su Nan.

42
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,160
What a surprise!

43
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,960
Miss Su, you found

44
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,920
such a rich young boyfriend so quickly.

45
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,680
You...

46
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:35,960
You know each other?

47
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:37,880
Yes.

48
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,800
Miss Su was a
rich man hunter at college.

49
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,040
Quite famous.

50
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:48,840
Come on.

51
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,400
Have something to drink.

52
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,240
Don't just talk.

53
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,880
Thanks.

54
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:51,760
What happened to your hand?

55
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,880
Yesterday, I met a psychopath
in the street.

56
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:58,960
He said his pants were good

57
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,320
and insisted on selling them to me.

58
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:01,880
Seriously?

59
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,440
Were you hurt?

60
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:04,560
No.

61
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:05,680
I got rid of him.

62
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,680
There are a lot of freaks like that.

63
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,320
Stay safe when you go out.

64
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,320
Do a hot compress later.

65
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,000
OK.

66
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,320
Let me hold it for you.

67
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,200
Yibei,

68
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,400
have something to drink.

69
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,720
I've got business to do.

70
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,840
Enjoy yourselves.

71
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:27,520
Oops.

72
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:28,960
It's OK.

73
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:29,720
Mr. Xu, come on.

74
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,720
Let's talk up there.

75
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,280
Go.

76
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,280
This way.

77
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,520
Here's the information
I've collected about orphanages.

78
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,080
Check it out.

79
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,720
It'll help, I guess.

80
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,040
Thanks, Mr. Kang.

81
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,080
Thank you, Mr. Kang.

82
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,000
You're welcome.

83
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,720
Not a big deal.

84
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,080
(Lost Children
of Quxian County Orphanage)

85
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,800
(Anpingte Children's Home)

86
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:59,400
(Lost Children
of Quxian County Orphanage)

87
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,880
Here's the bill.

88
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,520
How's he?

89
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,760
He has come through.

90
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,960
Luckily, that girl saved him.

91
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,880
- Umm...
- Umm...

92
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,160
You go first.

93
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,040
Mr. Gu...

94
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,560
I'm just curious.

95
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,240
If you don't want to tell me,

96
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,040
forget it.

97
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,680
He was my boyfriend.

98
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,520
Many years ago, though.

99
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:09,520
Umm...

100
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,200
Mr. Xu,

101
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:12,400
sorry for today.

102
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,800
It's OK. I understand.

103
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,680
If I were him,

104
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:17,840
I would do that, too.

105
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:27,920
All right.

106
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,720
Don't worry.

107
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,200
Go home and have some rest.

108
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,320
If I get any news about your case,

109
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,240
I'll let you know immediately.

110
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,440
I'm really grateful, Mr. Xu.

111
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,080
I don't know how I can repay you.

112
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,720
Give yourself to me?

113
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,800
Hao Jia would do that.

114
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,240
I'm not qualified, though.

115
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,560
Just kidding.

116
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,120
It's getting late.

117
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:53,960
You should go home.

118
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:54,800
OK.

119
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,040
Go to bed early.

120
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,400
OK.

121
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,000
Bye-bye.

122
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,800
Yeah, bye-bye.

123
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:14,840
Su Nan.

124
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,440
What?

125
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,360
What's your relationship with him?

126
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:22,920
He's my friend.

127
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,000
What's wrong?

128
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,000
Boyfriend?

129
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,160
None of your business.

130
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:31,800
Su Nan,

131
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,000
let's talk about our business.

132
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,760
Five years ago,

133
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,080
you broke up with me.

134
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:40,880
Why?

135
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,360
What's your point?

136
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,320
So, he's the rich young man

137
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,760
you talked about, huh?

138
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,880
Is this the life you've been expecting?

139
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,040
Gu Yibei, stop!

140
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,320
How could you do this to me?

141
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,120
What are you doing?

142
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:55,880
How could you?

143
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,320
Gu Yibei, let go of me!

144
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,800
How could you do this to me?

145
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,800
How could you?

146
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,560
Yibei.

147
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,320
You haven't had dinner, right?

148
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,640
Here's your favorite food.

149
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,600
What are you thinking? Have dinner.

150
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,320
Oh.

151
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,480
One always wants what he can't get.

152
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,760
But one who is loved

153
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,720
never fears anything.

154
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,320
What are you talking about?

155
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,920
You have no idea.

156
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:38,360
Now you have a great pursuer.

157
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,320
Who do you mean?

158
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,720
Gu Yibei.

159
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,680
He is

160
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,640
a little bit overbearing.

161
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,960
But I can tell

162
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,760
that he really loves you.

163
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,000
You don't understand

164
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,320
what we suffer from one-sided love.

165
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,200
Never mind. Don't bring him up.

166
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,280
Who do you have one-sided love for?

167
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:15,480
I'm talking about Gu Yibei.

168
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,880
You keep turning him down.

169
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,680
So, he has one-sided love.

170
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:19,640
Focus on the food.

171
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,200
