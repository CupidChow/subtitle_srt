(Ming Chun Restaurant)

16
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,200
Still don't know how to tear the bun?

17
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,160
Are you married?

18
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,200
What does your husband do?

19
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,200
How old is your child?

Gu Yibei, you're intentional, huh?

21
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,920
Five years ago, you suddenly disappeared.

22
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:12,640
Why?

23
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,680
Because...

24
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,720
You had an entrepreneurial failure

25
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,840
and I lost the sense of security.

26
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,440
Then I wanted...

27
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,440
What did you want?

28
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,400
I wanted to have a rich boyfriend

29
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,240
and live a great life.

30
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,840
Have you found one?

31
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,280
Not yet.

32
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,600
I've got business to do.

33
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,080
I should go.

34
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,160
Sir,

35
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:52,920
the bill, please.

36
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,160
Oh.

37
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,600
But I'm supposed to pay.

38
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:03,960
Su Nan,

39
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,160
I never have other women pay the bill.

40
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,440
My mom did it before I was 18.

41
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,920
After that, my wife would pay.

42
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,560
But you

43
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,440
don't get to do that.

44
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:33,520
Oh.

45
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,280
Your phone...

46
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,200
Hey!

(Hao Jia)

48
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:50,680
Hello.

49
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,800
Hello, Su Nan.

50
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,680
Are you available this weekend?

51
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:54,640
Yes.

52
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:55,920
Yes?

53
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,120
Then meet someone with me.

54
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,760
He can help to look for your parents.

55
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,000
Really?

56
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,280
Of course.

57
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,200
It's a deal.

58
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,960
Don't stand me up then.

59
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,600
I won't.

60
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,680
I'll hang up.

61
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,960
I can't take it anymore.

62
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,680
So handsome.

63
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,880
Yes, the horse looks great.

64
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,160
The rider, I mean.

65
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,280
A man looks virile when riding a horse.

66
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:52,160
Su Nan,

67
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:52,760
look.

68
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,600
He's so hot. So hot.

69
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,880
Su Nan, did you see him?

70
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,600
Yes.

71
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,320
My apologies.

72
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,040
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

73
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,160
Mr. Xu,

74
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,600
this is Su Nan,

75
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,680
my classmate at college and best friend.

76
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,000
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

77
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:44,880
Be seated, please.

78
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,480
Mr. Xu,

79
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,320
when you were riding the horse,

80
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,320
you looked so hot.

81
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,200
Then when I'm not riding it...

82
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,560
You look hotter then.

83
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,520
Here. Have some water.

84
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,960
Go on with that.

85
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:57,440
Keep praising me
and I would believe you.

86
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,680
She hung up on me.

87
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,000
Hao Jia

88
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,200
told me about your story.

89
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,520
Mr. Xu,

90
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,480
you have a wide range of contacts.

91
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:15,720
For Su Nan's case,

92
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,760
please help her.

93
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,280
Friends should help each other.

94
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,440
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

95
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,280
If you can find my parents,

96
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,800
I'll have to thank you.

97
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,720
How?

98
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:26,880
Well,

99
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:27,880
if you find her parents,

100
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,400
how about this?

101
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,560
I'll sacrifice myself.

102
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,400
I...

103
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,560
I'll give myself to you.

104
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,200
Give yourself to me?

105
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,800
In this case,

106
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,760
find another helper.

107
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,320
I have business to do.

108
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:42,920
Excuse me, ladies.

109
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,680
Yeah, OK.

110
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:44,880
Mr. Xu,

111
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,480
I'll take that as a yes.

112
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,280

please deliver it to...)
