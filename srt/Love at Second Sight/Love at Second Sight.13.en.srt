Mr. Xu?

I dropped by to pick you up.

Me?

Mr. Xu.

00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,160
Hi, Mr. Gu.

25
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,840
Long time no see.

26
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,800
According to Mr. Kang,

27
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,160
you're a young talent.

28
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,120
Hope we can cooperate someday.

29
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:37,800
Sure.

30
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,720
But I've got business now.

31
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:40,600
Gotta go.

32
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,720
Mr. Gu...

33
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,440
He's fun.

34
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,160
Let's have dinner tomorrow evening.

35
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,640
Dinner?

36
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,640
I know a great restaurant.

37
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,280
My treat.

38
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,040
Let me pay, Mr. Xu.

39
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,520
You helped to look for my parents.

40
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,560
You're welcome.

41
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:02,680
Tomorrow is my birthday.

42
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:03,800
It is?

43
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:05,680
Go.

44
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:06,520
OK.

45
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,720
I haven't had this much fun
for a long time!

46
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,080
Yeah!

47
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,080
Drink!

48
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:35,720
OK!

49
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,440
Come on.

50
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,120
Cheers, dude.

51
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,200
Cheers.

52
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,400
Mr. Kang, what are you up to lately?

53
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,240
Nothing special.

54
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,120
I just introduce people to each other.

55
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,760
I'm always so kind.

56
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,040
You know that.

57
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,120
Yibei,

58
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,080
do you

59
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,440
remember your classmate?

60
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:12,840
Who?

61
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,040
The girl

62
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,880
Xu Zhaolin brought to me.

63
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,960
Miss Su Nan.

64
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,200
Quite an old friend. I don't remember.

65
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,160
Two years ago,

66
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,960
during your business trip
in the neighboring city,

67
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,080
you had stomach bleeding.

68
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,280
Don't you remember?

69
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,360
(Emergency Room)

70
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,200
How's he, doctor?

71
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,920
He's in an emergency

72
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,200
and needs blood transfusions.

73
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,080
His blood type is Rhesus Macacus

74
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,320
but we don't have any in stock.

75
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,560
Thank you.

76
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,200
I'll pay the bill, first.

77
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,200
And I'll try to get the blood.

78
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,280
Doctor,

79
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:28,920
I have this type of blood.

80
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,640
You did big blood transfusions.

81
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,680
Have some rest here.

I found her familiar.

117
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:08,040
After I thought hard,

118
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,800
I finally remembered.

119
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,040
I met her in the hospital.

120
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,240
She risked her life on blood donation.

121
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,280
Well,

122
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,400
She has quite a hard life.

123
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:22,920
You know what?

124
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,400
She's an orphan.

125
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:34,360
Orphan?

126
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,640
You found no more clues
in the orphanage.

127
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,200
But we're at least sure

128
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,920
that you weren't discarded.

129
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,240
Jia,

130
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,120
I thought about it many times.

131
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,320
If I were really discarded...

132
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,120
Think about it.

133
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,360
Even if I find them,

134
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,080
how shall I face them?

135
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:19,040
Don't overthink.

136
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,200
You weren't discarded.

137
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,080
But anyway,

138
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,440
Xu Zhaolin

139
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,480
pays great attention

140
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,720
to helping you.

141
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,000
He does.

142
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,720
He's a nice guy.

143
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,320
Then do you have feelings

144
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,880
for him?

145
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,320
What feelings?

146
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:48,280
Love feelings, of course.

147
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,640
Love?

148
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,720
I don't love him.

149
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,520
What are you thinking?

150
00:09:58,640 --> 00:09:59,840
I'll be relieved, then.

151
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,720
Don't imagine things.

Gu Yibei...

153
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,400
He knew I visited the orphanage.

154
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,080
What?

155
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,720
Why does he stick to you

156
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,200
like glue?

157
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,280
He thought

158
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,880
I had his baby.

159
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,400
Ah?

160
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,440
