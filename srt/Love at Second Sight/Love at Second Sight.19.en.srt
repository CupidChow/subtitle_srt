15
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,440
Isn't the plot where Su Nan was
dragged away just now

16
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,600
too dramatic?

17
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:15,880
Admittedly,

18
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,320
Mr. Gu did look a bit like
a domineering boss.

19
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,840
I know, right?

20
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:20,720
Su Nan

21
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,000
really is a man's lady.

22
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,360
Even Mr. Xu, our group's boss,

23
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,160
asks her out often.

24
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,960
Wouldn't she feel so happy that

25
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,960
she's surrounded by two handsome men?

26
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,480
No way.

27
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,360
What about our Ms. Jiang...

28
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:37,920
- Ms. Jiang.
- Ms. Jiang.

29
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:42,920
We made trouble.

30
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,120
Hey.

31
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,160
I'm looking for you.

32
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,360
When will you give me

33
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:52,840
the performance report of this month?

34
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,360
Xu Zhaolin.

35
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,920
Tell me, in what way
am I inferior to Su Nan?

36
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,320
Why are you going crazy again?

37
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,560
Zhaolin,

38
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,960
only I love you with all my heart,

39
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,920
can't we make up?

40
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,560
Jiang Lan,

41
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,360
we have already broken up.

42
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,920
I'll warn you one last time.

43
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,440
Don't be unreasonable.

44
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,160
But you haven't been seeing
anyone else in the past two years.

45
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,040
Even if I'm not with anyone,

46
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,000
it's impossible for us to be together.

47
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:21,880
Zhaolin.

48
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,120
You said that

49
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,120
you would only love me
for the rest of your life.

50
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,400
I know

51
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,440
it's my fault.

52
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,560
It's because I'm wilful.

53
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,640
Could you not abandon me?

54
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,280
(I didn't expect that)

55
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,280
(it would still be you
who helps me fulfill my wish.)

56
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,200
(Yibei.)

57
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,360
(I'm really lucky.)

58
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,920
(Heaven sends you to me
the second time.)

59
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,120
(I want to hold on
to every precious second,)

60
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,720
(but I'm in no position to say
that I love you anymore.)

61
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,320
(I hope you are fine.)

62
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,160
(I will still make a wish
to the moon every day)

63
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,360
(for you to be happy)

64
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,400
(every minute and every second)

65
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,760
(all year around.)

66
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,120
It's you.

67
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:18,440
Yes. So what?

68
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,120
Xu Zhaolin.

69
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,040
It's been two years.

70
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,560
How come it only takes one Su Nan

71
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,960
to turn us into what we are now?

72
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,960
Our relationship already ended
two years ago.

73
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,320
Su Nan wasn't around at that time.

74
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,680
Don't be a fool.

75

Xu Zhaolin.

76
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,280
I have no regrets about you.
