I won't walk you up.

00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:19,960
Mm.

17
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,400
Mr. Xu,

18
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,520
thank you for tonight.

19
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,360
Why?

20
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,680
I even failed to protect you.

21
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,800
My bad.

22
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,960
Sorry to spoil your birthday.

23
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:39,760
All right.

24
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,000
If we keep saying this,

25
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,480
we'll be nagging people

26
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,480
and it won't be over.

27
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,040
OK. Go back home.

28
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,960
You're back?

29
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,520
How late you are!

30
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,640
What's wrong?

31
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,240
Have some water.

32
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,400
What happened?

33
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,600
Who slapped you?

34
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,120
Just my bad luck.

35
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,280
(Note: Slap her hard.)

36
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,520
Slap?

37
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,640
An anonymous order?

38
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,400
Who can be that crazy?

39
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,880
Can it be Gu Yibei?

40
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,000
No way.

41
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,080
Wait.

42
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,440
I'll give him a lesson someday.

43
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,720
She had lived

44
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,360
a hard life.

45
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,080
Her father

46
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,240
wasn't a good man.

47
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:02,080
He was a compulsive gambler.

48
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,400
What's worse,

49
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,080
he often did

50
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,080
some dirty jobs.

51
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,280
When her mother was badly sick,

52
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,360
her father

53
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,680
even lost the money for medical bills.

54
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,520
And later, he was put in prison for embezzlement.

55
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,920
Without the money for medicine,

56
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,160
the treatment was delayed

57
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,000
and her mother died.

58
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,680
I didn't expect Gu Yibei to be so crazy.

59
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,440
How could he do that to you?

60
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:37,720
Su Nan!

61
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,400
Gu Yibei,

62
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,720
how do you have the nerve?

63
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:42,160
Su Nan, let me explain.

64
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,520
Explain what?

65
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,480
No need at all.

66
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:44,800
Jia.

67
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:49,960
I'm sorry.

68
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,520
If apologies are useful,

69
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,280
why would we need the police?

70
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,880
I'll give you a lesson for Su Nan.

71
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:54,640
Jia, stop.

72
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,160
Gu Yibei,

73
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,360
I didn't know you could be so crazy.

74
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,560
Jia, let's go.

75
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,320
Su Nan!

76
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,400
Hello,

77
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:27,840
Nan.

78
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:28,920
What's up?

79
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,200
Anything wrong, Nan?

80
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:39,920
What happened?

81
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,560
Nothing, Yibei.

82
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:43,720
I just...

83
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,600
I just feel a little bit bad.

84
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,040
Why?

85
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,640
Why is life so hard?

86
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,400
Don't worry.

87
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,120
The business problem
will be solved soon.

88
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,240
How about this, Nan?

89
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,440
I'm going to see you right now.

90
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,360
No. Don't come.

91
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,320
I...

92
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,320
I just...

93
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,960
My parents just quarreled.

94
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,640
I'm all right.

95
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,240
I can accompany you
for a couple of days.

96
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:18,840
No need.

97
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,360
You've got a project to do, huh?

98
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,560
Focus on your work.

99
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:26,960
OK.

100
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,480
Hang in there.

101
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:30,640
Goodbye, Yibei.

102
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:50,040
I got you, at last.

103
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,360
Yibei,

104
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,160
what's wrong?

105
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,760
What are you up to?

106
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,080
Did anything happen?

107
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,040
Tell me.

108
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:13,400
Mm.

109
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,160
If a girl

110
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:20,160
was discarded by her parents
in childhood

111
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,960
and when she grew up,

112
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,160
she was discarded again
by her adoptive parents,

113
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,120
was she pitiful?

114
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,360
Who are you talking about?

115
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,680
Do I know her?

116
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,080
It doesn't matter.

117
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Just tell me.

118
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,000
How can I help her?

119
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,280
Who...

120
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,160
Who is she to you?

121
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,040
Someone who saved my life.

122
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,960
What, Mr. Xu?

123
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,240
Our business of this season
increased a lot.

124
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:58,320
The profit rate also rose accordingly.

125
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:00,480
Good.

126
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,160
You contributed a lot

127
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,560
to the good management.

128
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,040
So,

129
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,920
you always need me, huh?

130
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,760
You used the wrong word.

131
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,840
Our company needs you,

132
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,440
not me.

133
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,880
But to me, you're the company.

134
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,760
What's more,

135
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,000
you're everything to me.

136
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,440
Zhaolin,

137
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,520
we spent a lot of happy days together.

138
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,400
Don't you miss the old days?

139
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,080
Like you said,

140
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,200
such are old days.

141
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,640
Now, we're only colleagues.

142
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:34,960
All right.

143
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,120
Let's call it a day.

144
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,880
You did a good job this month.

145
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:38,960
Keep trying.

146
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,920
Zhaolin!

147
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:47,840
I know

148
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,280
you're so cold to me

149
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,000
because of that vixen.

150
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,480
Ms. Jiang,

151
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,840
a client just called,

152
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,520
saying something was wrong
with the contract.

153
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,920
Please check it.

154
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,200
Can't you guys solve the problem?

155
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:04,360
Why do you always bother me?

156
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,560
Losers!

157
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,440
Get out!

158
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,920
(How to find biological parents?)

159
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,080
Gu Yibei,

160
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,200
I found you at last.

161
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,520
Where have you been these days?

162
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,040
I failed to find you anywhere.

163
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,320
I went to Ningcheng City.

164
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:33,600
Ningcheng City?

165
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,880
But why?

166
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:36,920
What?

167
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,720
Must I tell you

168
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,040
where I go or what I do?

169
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,520
I'm OK with that.

170
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,640
But honestly,

171
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,360
when you were away,

172
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,760
I contacted the suppliers

173
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,280
and negotiated with the contractors.

174
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:54,080
(How to find biological parents?)
Even a little problem with the Technical Dept.

175
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,840
I was as busy as a bee.

176
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,000
