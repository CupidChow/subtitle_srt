00:01:16,028 --> 00:01:16,710
at this party,

17
00:01:17,199 --> 00:01:18,457

is he?

24
00:01:26,576 --> 00:01:27,476

28
00:01:32,311 --> 00:01:34,089
you're all sophisticated

31
00:01:37,311 --> 00:01:38,743

One for you and the other for me.

54
00:03:27,888 --> 00:03:29,878
Then you and I would never break up.

55
00:03:30,038 --> 00:03:32,149
(Let's break up.)

56
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:39,911
(Let's break up.)

57
00:03:54,868 --> 00:03:55,787
(Gu Yibei?)

58
00:03:56,148 --> 00:03:57,411
(How could it be him?)

59
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:01,292
(I believed we would never meet again.)

60
00:04:02,371 --> 00:04:04,705
(But now we meet once more.)

61
00:04:05,706 --> 00:04:07,636
(Is it a joke of destiny?)

62
00:04:09,131 --> 00:04:10,158
(Her eyes)

63
00:04:10,611 --> 00:04:11,836
(are behind the mask.)

64
00:04:12,591 --> 00:04:14,048
(But even if years have passed,)

65
00:04:14,147 --> 00:04:15,371
(I can still recognize them.)

66
00:04:15,517 --> 00:04:16,289
Thanks.

67
00:04:52,748 --> 00:04:53,611
Wow.

68
00:04:53,805 --> 00:04:55,961
It's much bigger than our dorms.

69
00:04:57,885 --> 00:05:00,876
We no longer need
to live in faraway dorms.

70
00:05:01,121 --> 00:05:02,790
That's quite "faraway".

71
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:09,410
Su Nan.

76
00:05:41,854 --> 00:05:43,765
(and the summer we spent together.)

- (But...)
- Shall we date?

78
00:05:46,374 --> 00:05:47,913
- (Su Nan, why did you...)
- Marry me after graduation.

79
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:48,614

80

00:05:55,014 --> 00:05:56,056
we can get the marriage license first.

84
00:05:56,294 --> 00:05:57,224
Then we'll hold a wedding
after graduation.

85
00:05:58,454 --> 00:05:59,090
OK.

86
00:06:00,014 --> 00:06:01,509

you've let it go.
