Gu Yibei.

Nan?

00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,560
Nan.

19
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,000
What are you doing?

20
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:42,400
Gu Yibei!

Gu Yibei!

22
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:45,400
Get up.

23
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:46,760
What happened?

24
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,080
Be careful.

25
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,120
What's wrong?

26
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,240
Nan.

27
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:56,720
Nan.

28
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,080
Nan, I'm sorry.

29
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,520
I remember what day today is.

30
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,360
I prepared a present for you.

31
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,120
But they made me drink,

32
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,200
saying it was an important dinner.

33
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,880
I...

34
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:13,840
I promise.

35
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:15,200
I promise

36
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,560
it wouldn't happen again.

37
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:19,840
Nan,

38
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:20,760
I...

39
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,360
We...

40
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,680
We would see a movie
and I bought the tickets.

41
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:28,840
I know.

42
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:29,920
I know

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,280
I failed to keep my promises.

44
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,040
Let's make a deal.

45
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:37,880
This...

46
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,760
This weekend,

47
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,360
shall we...

48
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,920
Shall we go see a movie?

49
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,400
Nan,

50
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,080
have you waited for too long

51
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:49,920
under my dormitory?

52
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,960
Did I come back too late?

53
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,480
Nan,

54
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,320
I would come back earlier next time.

55
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,760
I wouldn't keep you waiting for too long.

56
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,720
Yibei.

57
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:08,920
Yibei,

58
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,640
what happened?

59
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,360
Nan,

60
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:20,360
didn't I ask you to wait under my dorm?

61
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,840
It's dangerous to come out so late.

62
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,800
Silly man.

63
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,480
Don't you feel terrible when drunk?

64
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:28,800
Nan,

65
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,520
you know what?

66
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,800
Tonight,

67
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,120
I got a big project.

68
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,080
You should feel happy for me.

69
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,400
Fine, fine.

70
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:43,680
I'm happy.

71
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,600
But drink less next time.

72
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,160
Nan, I'm sorry.

73
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,920
I shouldn't have kept you waiting.

74
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,600
Trust me. I will...

75
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,840
Gu Yibei!

76
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,800
Don't you know your health condition?

77
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,120
Why did you go to the hospital then?

78
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,520
Don't you know what danger you were in?

79
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,600
Why...

80
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:14,880
Why can't you

81
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,600
take good care of yourself?

82
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,400
Why did you discard me?

83
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,280
Why did you leave me all alone?

84
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,040
Gu Yibei.

85
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,160
Gu Yibei.

86
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,760
Anybody here?

87
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,560
Waiter!

88
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,680
Waiter!

89
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,080
What's up, miss?

90
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:48,920
Excuse me.

91
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,280
Someone's drunk. Help me get him up.

92
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:50,840
OK.

93
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,240
Go.

94
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,280
Where's his room card?

95
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,080
Come on.

96
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,040
Be careful.

97
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,760
Watch your step.

98
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,280
Hold him for the moment.

99
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:20,800
OK.

100
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:30,680
All right.

101
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,360
Miss,

102
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,040
take care of your boyfriend. I should go.

103
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,400
No.

104
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:36,880
He isn't my boyfriend.

105
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,120
Fine. Take care of your husband.

106
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:41,840
But...

107
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,480
He isn't my husband, either.

108
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,480

I...

125

Just now,

126
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,960
I met Gu Yibei by chance.

127
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:36,560
He's drunk.

128
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,720

130
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,480

131
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:47,920
Yibei.

132
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,600
Yibei?

133
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,840
Yibei.

134
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,040
Wow.

135
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,360
It's much bigger than our dorms.

136
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,400
We no longer need to live
in faraway dorms.

137
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,440
That's quite "faraway".

138
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,160
There's a loft?

139
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:40,920
Let me check up there.

140
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,120
You rent such a big flat.

141
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,120
What a waste of money!

142
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,400
Wow.

143
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,840

147

we can get the marriage license first.

151
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,280
Then we'll hold a wedding
after graduation.

OK.

153
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,440

Chinese or western?

154

Both!

155
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,040
Then we can hold two weddings.

156
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,160
Be careful.

157
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:28,720
