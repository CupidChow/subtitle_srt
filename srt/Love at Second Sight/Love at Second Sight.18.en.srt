As a family, let's be frank.

16
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,960
I want to ask you something.

17
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:15,920
What is it?

18
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,680
I've heard that

19
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,600
Su Nan

20
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,160
is adopted.

21
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,480
So I want to ask for

22
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:24,760
the information of

23
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,920
her biological parents.

24
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,440
Why do you ask for this?

25
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:32,560
Listen.

26
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,040
Although Su Nan
is not my flesh and blood,

27
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,080
she's

28
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,360
my daughter.

29
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,160
Let me tell you.

30
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,960
None of you can

31
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,840
take her away from me.

32
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,160
Do you hear me?

33
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:48,800
Come on.

34
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,280
Let's drink. Drink.

35
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:56,040
What are you talking about?

36
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,720
She'll forever be your daughter.

37
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,240
Stop talking.

38
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:01,840
I won't tell you

39
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,200
no matter what.

40
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:03,920
Uncle.

41
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,160
Let's drink.

42
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:04,560
Dad.

43
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,920
No matter what you say.

44
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:06,320
Come on.

45
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,000
Dad.

46
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:15,560
I know

47
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,080
that you are a bit short on money.

48
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,640
How about this?

49
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,320
I'll give you one million yuan

50
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,360
if you tell me the information

51
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,280
of Su Nan's biological parents.

52
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,480
How much?

53
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,400
One million yuan.

54
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,360
I didn't hear you clearly.

55
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,840
Say that again.

56
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,240
One million yuan!

57
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,040
OK.

58
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,840
Deal.

59
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:45,840
Come on.

60
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:10,560
Wait.

61
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,280
Remember to give me the money.

62
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,600
OK.

63
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,480
OK.

64
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,400
Come on.

65
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,120
Hurry

66
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,640
and get me those women.

67
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:22,320
OK.

68
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,160
Hurry.

69
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,000
Come on.

70
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,240
Hurry and get them.

71
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:25,800
OK.

72
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,360
Be quick.

73
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,400
One million yuan.

74
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,800
That's one million yuan.

75
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,240
Sir.

76
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,080
Sir.

77
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,640
Here is your bill, please check it out.

78
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,080
Where is my son-in-law?

79
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,840
We don't know where your son-in-law is.

80
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:04,760
Get lost.

81
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,000
I'm sleeping.

82
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,520
Don't touch me.

83
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:16,760
I can walk myself.

84
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:17,600
Don't touch me.

85
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,120
Hey, listen.

86
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,680
My son-in-law is a boss.

87
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,880
Believe it or not,

88
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:23,920
just one word from me

89
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,120
and he'll buy your shabby store.

90
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,320
Hurry up and leave.

91
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,200
Wait.

92
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,360
Who said that

93
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,760
they would give me two million yuan?

94
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,680
Yang Weidong.

95
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:44,720
Age 56.

96
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,080
(Police Registration Form)
He lives in Xi'an

97
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,880
(Police Registration Form)
and had a lost daughter in his early years.

98
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,480
Where is he right now?

99
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,160
This

100
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,200
took me a lot of effort.

101
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:57,680
Mr. Gu,

102
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,800
how are you going to thank me?

103
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:02,880
Don't worry about it.

104
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,520
You are so insincere.

105
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,240
No. 29, Shengli Road.

106
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,120
Yes.

107
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,240
You'd better hurry

108
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,000
if you want to find him.

109
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,240
I heard that

110
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,400
his son had done the immigration
procedures for him and his wife,

111
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,960
and it seems that
they will leave the country soon.

112
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:38,680
Su Nan.

113
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:39,400
Come out with me for a minute.

114
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:39,840
What do you want?

115
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:40,480
Hey.

116
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:48,800
Ms. Jiang,

117
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,040
Su Nan was dragged away
by Mr. Gu from Weiyi Technology.

118
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,240
What?

119
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,160
This little temptress
is really good at hooking up.

120
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,000
Your biological parents

121
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,240
could not find you

122
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,600
and later gave birth to a son.

123
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,520
They are going to emigrate.

124
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:46,160

126
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,480

127
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:17,240
Hurry.

128
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,120
OK.

129
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,000
What's the matter?

130
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,400
They are doing well.

131
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,160
Knowing that is good enough for me.

132
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,640
Thank you, Yibei.

133
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,720
