Su Nan.

Why do you come here?

00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,840
What do you want?

19
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,200
Hey,

20
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,040
Su Nan.

21
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,640
I see that you are having a good time.

22
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,400
I heard that

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,440
you found your biological parents.

24
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,840
It wasn't easy for me

25
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,720
to raise you for more than 20 years,

26
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:50,840
was it?

27
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,160
What in the world do you want?

28
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:56,560
How about this?

29
00:01:57,440 --> 00:01:58,080
Give me

30
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,080
one million yuan.

31
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,000
How do I have that kind of money?

32
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:01,960
You don't.

33
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,120
But Gu Yibei does.

34
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,600
Can you stop trying
to take advantage of Gu Yibei?

35
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,760
Don't you think
you've done enough harm to him?

36
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:11,840
Su Nan.

37
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:12,640
Look,

38
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,240
for the sake of us
being father and daughter,

39
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,280
right?

40
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:16,800
Listen.

41
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,600
Tell Gu Yibei

42
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,000
to give one million yuan

43
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,120
to me,

44
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,480
and I promise

45
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,960
to leave you two alone in the future.

46
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,120
If he doesn't,

47
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,200
I'll tell your secret

48
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,720
to Gu Yibei.

49
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:29,000
In your dreams.

50
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,520
Hey.

51
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:30,880
Su Nan.

52
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:32,920
Su Nan.

53
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,080
Let me tell you.

54
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,080
If you don't give me the money,

55
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:37,800
I'll tell Gu Yibei

56
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,240
that you stole the code.

57
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,520
Is what he said real?

58
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:03,280
I'm sorry.

59
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,880
I'm sorry.

60
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,640
I'm sorry, Yibei.

61
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,120
You are good.

62
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,200
Keep in mind to take plenty of rest.

63
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,800
You, come out with me.

64
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:34,360
Doctor,

65
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,960
what is the actual condition
of my mother?

66
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,320
She's not good.

67
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,600
She needs urgent surgery.

68
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,560
Please deal with the cost
as soon as possible.

69
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,120
Nan.

70
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,040
I know I'm wrong.

71
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,920
I deserve it.

72
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,880
You can turn your back on me,

73
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,920
but you can't abandon your mom, right?

74
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,320
Can you stand by

75
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,680
and watch your mother die?

76
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,360
Dad.

77
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,080
I know that you are in
a good relationship with Gu Yibei.

78
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,120
You know

79
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,280
everything about him.

80
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,640
So if you don't do it,

81
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,880
our family will be doomed.

82
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,120
Can you stop pushing me, Dad?

83
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,960
I've thought about a lot of methods,

84
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:20,160
but there really was
nothing else I could do.

85
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:22,160
Nan.

86
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,960
I'm begging you.

87
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,880
Dad, I...

88
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:27,640
Fine.

89
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,120
I'll kneel down for you.

90
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,080
OK, OK.

91
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,000
Don't do that.

92
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:31,960
Dad.

93
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,680
Then be a good girl.

94
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,200
Do what I said, OK?

95
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:40,400
Don't cry.

96
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,600
Be a good girl.

Dad.

98
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,360
Do what I said.

99
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,680
You are my good girl.

Anything wrong, Nan?

What happened?

107
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,200
Nothing, Yibei.

108
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,600
I just...

109
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,000
I just feel a little bit bad.

I'm going to see you right now.

No.

Don't come.

I just...

120

My parents just quarreled.

121
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,600
I'm all right.

122
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,440
I can accompany you
for a couple of days.

123
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,120
No need.

124

and we will certainly make it up
to your company.

Why haven't you moved out yet?
