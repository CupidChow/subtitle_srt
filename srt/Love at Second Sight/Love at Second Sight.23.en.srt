Have some water.

Thanks.

18
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:24,120
Su Nan.

19
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,000
You got this.

20
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,920
Don't get controlled
by those negative emotions.

Gu Yinan,

Gu Yixi in the future.

Just not Gu Yibei.

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:46,960
It's fine, Jia.

27
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,520
I've figured it out
during the last few days.

28
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,400
It's been years,

29
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,120
and it's time for me to try to move on.

30
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:01,880
Don't worry,

31
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:03,360
I'll be fine.

32
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,200
Xi'an is so beautiful.

33
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,320
But there are still lots of places
that I haven't taken you to.

34
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,560
I'll take you to Tang Paradise.

35
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,520
Then I'll take you to...

36
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:25,600
See the Terracotta Army.

37
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:26,280
The Terracotta Army.

38
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,760
Then I'll also take you to

39
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:30,000
Huaqing Pool.

40
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,600
Well, do you know what it is for?

41
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,600
It used to be a place for
Imperial Consort Yang to clean herself.

42
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,920
Wow, you actually know.

43
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,920
Let's

44
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,840
enjoy ourselves in Xi'an.

45
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,000
(Due to some personal reasons,
I resign from my position today.)

46
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,640
(Resignation Letter)

47
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:38,480
(Name: Su Nan)

48
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,560
Yibei.

49
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,000
Mom.

50
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,440
Come in, come in.

51
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,360
Good.

52
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,040
When it's done,

53
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,440
the position will be yours.

54
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,000
Come on.

55
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,040
Cheers.

56
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,560
OK.

57
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:28,560
Su Nan.

58
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,080
Are you sure you don't want to stay?

59
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,360
Mr. Xu.

60
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,640
In fact, I only came to Xi'an this time

61
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,160
to find my biological parents,

62
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,160
but I am really honored to have met you.

63
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,960
However, I've decided

64
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,400
to return to

65
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,080
where I belong
and start to live there again.

66
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,880
Hope you understand.

67
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:46,960
I do.

68
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:53,000
Well,

69
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,520
I wish you all the best.

70
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:56,360
Thanks.

71
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,760
Have some water.

72
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,000
Jia,

73
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,320
give me your cup.

74
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,200
Leave it to me.

75
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:14,960
Zhaolin.

76
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:16,560
Kang.

77
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,200
Gee, sorry,

78
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,880
I'm late. I just had another one.

79
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,160
What's up?

80
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:20,880
What's the situation?

81
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,360
Here's the deal.

82
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,800
I have called you all here today

83
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,280
to talk about two things.

84
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,640
First,

85
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,000
I would like to thank you all

86
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:31,920
for your continued efforts

87
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,280
in helping me find
my biological parents;

88
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,560
second,

89
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,600
since I have found them,

90
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:37,640
I

91
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:38,880
decided

92
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,560
to leave the city

93
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,440
and return home to continue my life.

94
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:48,600
Well,

95
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,080
I made this decision a long time ago,

96
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:53,160
and I just never
had the chance to tell you,

97
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,760
so I hope I didn't spoil anyone's fun.

98
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,800
It's OK, it's OK.

99
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,040
As the saying goes,

100
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,840
all good things must come to an end.

101
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,760
What matters is

102
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,880
to have fun when we are all together.

103
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:05,840
Am I right?

104
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:06,840
Come on.

105
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:07,480
Today,

106
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,600
I'll be your host to grill.

107
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,360
Let's

108
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,080
eat and drink well.

109
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,560
OK?

110
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,280
Let's all enjoy ourselves.

111
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,000
Cheers.

112
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:12,680
Come on.

113
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,120
- Wish you all the best.
- All the best.

114
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,320
Yibei,

115
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,360
are you still waiting for her?

116
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,680
If...

117
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,800
I mean if...

118
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,960
Dad did something really bad

119
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,760
and it had serious consequences,

120
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,000
would you choose to forgive him?

121
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:47,520
Yes.

122
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,720
Then would you choose to stay with him?

123
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,200
It depends on

124
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,440
whether it's harder for you

125
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,880
to let go of those hard feelings

126
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,400
or it's more painful

127
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,080
to lose her forever.

128
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:09,880
Come on.

129
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,840
Hurry up and eat.

130
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,880
Eat when it's still hot.

131
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,600
Goodbye.

132
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,240
You are welcome to come back anytime.
