Yes, it is.

36
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,320
She's taking a shower.

37
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,720

38
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:13,880
I'm Gu Yibei.

Oh, by the way,

40
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,720
she may not be able to work today,

41
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,240
so I'm asking for leave for her now.

Are you jealous?

48
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,000

53
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,320
is a look to like someone;
