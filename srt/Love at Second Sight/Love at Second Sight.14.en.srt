No, thanks.

Zhaolin,

60
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,960
for your birthday every year,

61
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,600
I prepare the present for you.

62
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,000
No, thanks.

63
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,240
Hey.

64
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,880
Happy birthday to you.

65
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,920
Happy birthday to you.

66
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,320
Happy birthday to you.

67
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,280
Happy birthday to you.

68
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,360
Happy birthday, Mr. Xu.

69
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,200
Thank you.

70
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,600
Wish you a big fortune

71
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,040
and we would get promotions
and pay rises.

72
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,320
OK.

73
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,400
I'll cut the cake, then.

74
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,200
Eat.

75
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:01,920
Taste some.

76
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:11,920
Is it delicious?

77
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,200
It's a nice place, huh?

78
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,400
Yes. Quite beautiful.

79
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,400
You haven't come here before?

80
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,360
No. It's my first time.

81
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,040
Come more often when possible.

82
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,000
Excuse me.

83
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,920
Are you Miss Su Nan?

84
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:11,920
Yes.

85
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,360
A package for you.

86
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,720
Package?

87
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,000
I'm... I'm sorry!

88
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:17,560
Stop!

89
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:22,840
Are you OK?

90
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,880
Let me check.

91
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,160
(Note: Slap her hard.)

92
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,360
Get in the car.

93
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,440
What did you come here for?

94
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,960
For some business.

95
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,640
I'll leave tomorrow.

96
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,600
When you called me,

97
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,080
I was astonished.

98
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:17,880
Surprisingly, you have quite a good job.

99
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,200
Even your business

100
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,480
is a top secret.

101
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,240
You flatter me.

102
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,800
What about you? What are you up to?

103
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,240
Don't mention it.

104
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,320
That year

105
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,680
when we failed our business,

106
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,240
I was downhearted.

107
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,520
I gave up my career

108
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,760
for my love.

109
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,040
I came to this city with my wife.

110
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,160
By the way,

111
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,360
my wife is a native, too.

112
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,440
Since we settled down,

113
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,480
we've been living a simple life.

114
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,240
Later, we had a son.

115
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,000
How time flies!

116
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,440
Your child has grown this tall.

117
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,200
It does.

118
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,200
Cool boy, huh?

119
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:04,480
Tell me.

120
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,840
Did you meet Su Nan in this city?

121
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:09,880
Su Nan?

122
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,320
What a coincidence!

123
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,240
My wife was her classmate
in high school.

124
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,160
You didn't see it coming, huh?

125
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,280
According to my wife,

126
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,400
she had lived a hard life.

127
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,360
Her father

128
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,280
wasn't a good man.

129
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,440
He was a compulsive gambler.

130
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:29,720
What's worse,

131
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,480
he often did

132
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,240
some dirty jobs.

133
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,280
When her mother was badly sick,

134
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,480
her father

135
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,800
even lost the money for medical bills.

136
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,360
And later,

137
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,680
he was put in prison for embezzlement.

138
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,040
Without the money for medicine,

139
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,440
the treatment was delayed

140
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,280
and her mother died.

141
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,320
I thought you knew this.

142
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,840
Unexpectedly, you lost contact.

143
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,480
Forget it. Cheers.
