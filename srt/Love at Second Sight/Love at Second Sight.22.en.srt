Mom, what are you talking about?

17
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,200
I know.

18
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,160
I just

19
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,480
can't bear to leave you.

20
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,760
What are you talking about, Mom?

21
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,360
You are fine.

22
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,720
Don't talk nonsense.

23
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,600
Don't cry.

24
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,040
It's fine.

25
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,040
Mom.

26
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:47,960
When you get well,
let's go home and make dumplings,

27
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:48,720
OK?

28
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,960
OK.

29
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,520
Let's make the filling
with shrimp, pork, and chives.

30
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,440
Mom.

31
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,720
I'm fine.

32
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,960
How I wish

33
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,320
you were my own daughter.

34
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,840
Mom, what are you talking about?

35
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,520
Nan, listen to me.

36
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,040
I

37
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,560
can't be with you anymore.

38
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,760
I can't protect you anymore.

39
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,440
Don't blame me.

40
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,040
That year

41
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,160
when I saw you

42
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,160
smiling so sweetly at me

43
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:48,320
in the orphanage,

44
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:50,520
I felt that

45
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,000
you were just my daughter.

46
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,800
I'm so selfish

47
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,320
that I didn't tell you this.

48
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,160
Mom.

49
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,600
I'm always your daughter.

50
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,280
Nan, let me look at you more.

51
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,400
Now, I can't be with you anymore,

52
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,840
I can't protect you anymore, either.

53
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,400
Go find them.

54
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,560
Don't cry.

55
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,520
Mom.

56
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,400
Nan, don't cry.

57
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,120
Mom.

58
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,080
Nan, do you blame me?

59
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,240
No.

60
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,400
Then I'm relieved.

61
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:51,680
Mom.

62
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:53,720
Mom.

63
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,160
Doctor!

64
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,000
Mom.

65
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:19,880
Su Nan,

66
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,160
what are you doing sitting here
in the middle of the night?

67
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,040
Is it because of Gu Yibei?

68
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,040
Jia.

69
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,440
Let me ask you a question.

70
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,240
If you love someone very much,

71
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,800
but he chooses to hurt you,

72
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,040
will you forgive him?

73
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,240
Definitely not.

74
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,400
Me neither.

75
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:33,960
Yibei.

76
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,120
Do I still have a chance?

77
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,280
In the world of relationships,

78
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,920
I'm willing to play fairly.

79
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,120
Things won't work out between us.

80
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,800
Everything I've ever done is for you.

81
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,400
I am

82
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,400
also the one

83
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,280
who has always been by your side

84
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,280
and devoted myself to you unconditionally.

85
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,920
Because I've met someone before,

86
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,080
I've had to make do

87
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,320
with all the people
who showed up later since then.

88
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,160
But

89
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,280
I don't want to make do.

90
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,440
Nan.

91
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,000
Save me.

92
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:13,800
Nan.

93
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:14,640
Save me.

94
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,200
Nan.

95
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,120
Save me.

96
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,040
Nan!

97
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,880
Su Nan.

98
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,680
Su Nan.

99
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,680
Let's break up.

100
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,200
It's alright.

101
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,480
It's alright. It's alright.

102
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,960
It's just a nightmare.

103
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,920
It's alright.

104
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,400
Yaru?

105
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,080
Why are you here?

106
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,640
I'm here to get a file.

107
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,720
Wait for my good news.

108

Su Nan.

109
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,320
Let's hang out.

110
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,400
Isn't it just a break-up?

111
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,880
You've been like this for days.

112

you still have me.
