(Let's break up.)

16
00:01:40,677 --> 00:01:41,237
Yibei.

17
00:01:44,597 --> 00:01:45,365
What a coincidence!

18
00:01:45,797 --> 00:01:46,993
I'm waiting for you.

19
00:01:49,877 --> 00:01:50,798
Don't play dumb.

20
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,332
Don't you know I've waited for days?

21
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,805
I do.

22
00:01:55,101 --> 00:01:55,945
I also know

23
00:01:56,021 --> 00:01:57,912
you waited for nearly
two hours this morning.

24
00:02:00,821 --> 00:02:01,419
Well...

25
00:02:03,061 --> 00:02:03,665
Yibei,

26
00:02:05,061 --> 00:02:06,389
shall we date?

27
00:02:31,221 --> 00:02:32,021
Don't ask me.

28
00:02:32,301 --> 00:02:33,261
I don't know anything.

29
00:02:33,981 --> 00:02:35,621
You're Gu Yibei's roommate.

30
00:02:35,661 --> 00:02:37,581
You must know him best.

31
00:02:37,941 --> 00:02:40,836
You decide if he can get a girlfriend.

32
00:02:40,901 --> 00:02:42,227
But I really don't know anything.

33
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:45,337
How about this?

34
00:02:47,021 --> 00:02:47,781
You just...

35
00:02:59,781 --> 00:03:00,381
Su Nan,

36
00:03:01,501 --> 00:03:02,741
you've got balls.

37
00:03:04,261 --> 00:03:07,042
You asked around about my hobbies,
privacies, and schedules.

38
00:03:07,341 --> 00:03:09,112
So, you've bribed all my friends, huh?

39
00:03:15,501 --> 00:03:15,984
What?

40
00:03:16,741 --> 00:03:18,519
No guts to admit it?

41
00:03:19,986 --> 00:03:20,673
Not like that.

42
00:03:22,106 --> 00:03:23,302
I'm sorry, Yibei.

43
00:03:24,066 --> 00:03:24,506
I...

44
00:03:31,826 --> 00:03:32,575
I was kidding.

45
00:03:34,308 --> 00:03:35,767
Actually, we've done the same thing.

46
00:03:36,468 --> 00:03:37,470
What is it?

47
00:03:38,508 --> 00:03:39,570
You like me.

48
00:03:40,351 --> 00:03:41,362
And I like you, too.

49
00:03:42,667 --> 00:03:44,064
We like each other.

50
00:03:48,907 --> 00:03:49,871
Come on.

51
00:04:02,663 --> 00:04:03,257
Yibei,

52
00:04:03,503 --> 00:04:04,475
the bag you asked for.

53
00:04:12,623 --> 00:04:13,356
Hello, Jia.

54
00:04:13,623 --> 00:04:14,759
I haven't found my bag yet.

55
00:04:24,943 --> 00:04:25,743
Get in the car.

56
00:04:36,103 --> 00:04:37,777
Gu Yibei, what are you doing?

57
00:04:38,503 --> 00:04:39,111
Come on.

58
00:04:39,343 --> 00:04:40,238
Where are we going?

59
00:04:42,543 --> 00:04:43,063
Hey.

60
00:04:43,063 --> 00:04:44,703
I've got business to do this afternoon.

61
00:04:44,703 --> 00:04:45,863
Let me get off!

62
00:04:46,383 --> 00:04:47,543
If you don't,

63
00:04:47,623 --> 00:04:48,503
I'll jump off.

64
00:04:48,943 --> 00:04:49,463
Go ahead.

65
00:04:56,183 --> 00:04:56,703
Oh, come on.

66
00:04:57,423 --> 00:04:58,223
I'm just taking you somewhere.

67
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,760

68
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:22,983

What?

74

(Ming Chun Restaurant)

75
00:06:23,303 --> 00:06:24,617
So many diners are here.

76

Let's get out.

77
00:06:28,023 --> 00:06:28,663
They are?

78
00:06:29,783 --> 00:06:31,423
The plum juice here tastes great.

79
00:06:36,371 --> 00:06:37,011
Sit.

80
00:06:38,063 --> 00:06:39,503
So many diners are here.

81
00:06:39,743 --> 00:06:40,503
Let's try another restaurant.

82

The plum juice here tastes great.

83
00:06:43,143 --> 00:06:44,303
You have to taste some.

84
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,223
There you are, guys.

85
00:06:50,223 --> 00:06:51,503
It's been years.

86
00:06:51,503 --> 00:06:52,623
The same old order, right?

87
00:06:52,623 --> 00:06:53,583
Wait for a while.

88
00:07:23,098 --> 00:07:24,698
Here, enjoy the food.
