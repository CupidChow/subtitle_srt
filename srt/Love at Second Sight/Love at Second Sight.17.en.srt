00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:11,360
Hey,

16
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:13,160
Nan,

17
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,240
Nan.

18
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,640
You have to help me this time.

19
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,320
Another bunch of
debt collectors are coming.

20
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,200
How could you keep this on and on?

21
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,720
Because I'm deep in debts.

22
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,760
Didn't I just give you money?
You've spent them all already?

23
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,640
Gee, yes.

24
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,440
Who can I turn to for help
other than you?

25
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:27,480
Fine.

26
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,000
I can give you money.

27
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,000
But I'll ask you one last time.

28
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:32,560
Where is that file bag?

29
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:34,840
What file bag?

30
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,200
I have no idea.

31
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,080
You have no idea?

32
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,000
Wait,

33
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:39,880
Nan.

34
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,680
Could it be that
since I'm down and out,

35
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:43,720
you don't want to be
my daughter anymore

36
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,200
and want to find
your biological parents instead?

37
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,360
Will you give it to me or not?

38
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,200
I'll give it to you

39
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,000
under one condition.

40
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:52,520
What is it?

41
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,760
Su Zhihang.

42
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,760
Hurry and pay the money back.

43
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,240
Someone is thirsty for your blood.

44
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:58,920
Wait, mister.

45
00:01:58,920 --> 00:01:59,680
I admit that

46
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,240
I owe you money.

47
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,240
I'll definitely pay you back.

48
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:01,760
Give me two days.

49
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,080
Are you tired of living?

50
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,640
I'm asking my daughter for money, see?

51
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,840
Wait, mister.

52
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,680
So this is your daughter.

53
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,560
Wait, mister, don't touch my daughter!

54
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,200
Move aside.

55
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,200
Stop whining.

56
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,600
It has nothing to do with my daughter.

57
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,600
A daughter should pay for what
her father owes. Hand out the money.

58
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,720
Or else I'll...

59
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,080
Wait for me. Wait.

60
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:28,480
Are you alright?

61
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:29,600
Yes.

62
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,520
Come with me. I'll send you back.

63
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:31,880
OK.

64
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,320
Mister.

65
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,720
You haven't paid us.

66
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,840
Who's your mister?

67
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,880
Did I allow you to show up?

68
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,440
Didn't we agree that when I
touch my head, you show up?

69
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,920
You touched your head.

70
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:44,760
How come I touched my head?

71
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,320
I was just scratching an itch.

72
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,480
We

73
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:48,840
chased and swore.

74
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,440
We worked hard.

75
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:52,000
It's not easy for us.

76
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I didn't get money,

77
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,280
then how can you get paid?

78
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:54,880
Get lost.

79
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,520
All of you.

80
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,480
How dare you ask for money?

81
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,360
Get lost. Get lost.

82
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,600
How can this old man act like this?

83
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,560
Hmm. Smells good.

84
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,440
- Then let's dig in.
- Let's dig in.

85
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:15,720
Here.

86
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,120
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

87
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,720
You are welcome.

88
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:19,520
Tasty.

89
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,560
It is?

90
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,560
I'll have a try, too.

91
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,120
Have more of this.

92
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,480
Can you reach it?

93
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,360
Right, Su Nan.

94
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,400
Who are those people we met today?

95
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:34,880
It's nothing,
just some misunderstanding.

96
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,920
Mr. Xu, have some more.

97
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:40,560
Come on.

98
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,600
Have more of the eggplant.

99
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:45,560
And the meat.

100
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,520
Are they too far away for you to reach?

101
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,400
Have some more.

102
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:53,600
Su Nan.

103
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,280
Let me protect you in the future.

104
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,400
Mr. Xu.

105
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:02,480
Jia.

106
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,680
It's been a long time.
What brings you here?

107
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:07,840
I'm just stopping by.

108
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,920
You haven't eaten, have you?

109
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,000
I'll get you a bowl.

110
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,000
It smells so good.

111
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:17,800
Mr. Xu.

112
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,160
Thank you for

113
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,520
taking care of Su Nan these days.

114
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:21,640
No problem.

115
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,320
Why don't you eat?

116
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,680
Let's eat.

117
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:34,480
Here.

118
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,200
Su Nan doesn't like this.

119
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:38,800
Right?

120
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:45,680
- Do you want this?
- Do you want this?

121
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,200
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

122
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,000
Yibei.

123
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,560
This place is so beautiful.

124
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:17,880
Have a seat.

125
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,320
Is it just us?

126
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,400
Today, nobody else is here.

127
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:22,520
You are the VIP.

128
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:26,520
Gee.

129
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,600
It's so beautiful.

130
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,040
Gee, it's so big.

131
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,800
So pretty.

132
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,080
Yibei.

133
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,720
You truly are my good son-in-law.

134
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,680
Gee.

135
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,520
This is nice.

136
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,080
Brilliant.

137
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,800
Just looking at this makes me drool.

138
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,160
There's much more.

139
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,320
Eat as much as you like.

140
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,840
Don't worry.

141
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,880
I won't let you down today.

142
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,720
It's the cellophane noodles.

143
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:07,520
Yibei, don't mind if I do.

144
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,400
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

145
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,640
- Welcome to NO.1 KTV.
- Welcome to NO.1 KTV.

146
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,960
Greetings, please go this way.

147
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,160
Good evening, welcome to NO.1 KTV.

148
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,440
Good evening, welcome.

149
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,360
All of you, go out for now. Go out.

150
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,160
Hey, hey.

151
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,680
Misses, don't go.

152
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,160
Don't go.

153
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,200
Gee.

154
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,560
Why did you do that?

155
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,680
Your health is more important.

156
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:48,560
Come on.

157
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,520
Yibei.

158
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,600
At first glance,

159
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,080
I know you are a person
who can read the atmosphere.

160
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,000
You know that

161
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,320
I like this in particular.

162
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,640
Let me tell you.

163
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,080
I'll accept you as my son-in-law

164
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,400
with open arms.

165
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,240
Come on.

166
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:10,880
Come on.

167
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:15,760
Uncle.

168
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,480
In that case,

169
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,600
as a family, let's be frank.

170
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,840
I want to ask you something.

171
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:23,960
What is it?

172
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,800
I've heard that

173
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,640
Su Nan

174
