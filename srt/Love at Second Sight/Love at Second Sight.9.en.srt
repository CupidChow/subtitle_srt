Thanks.

17
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,000
Is it sweet?

18
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,120
Yes.

19
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,000
Sweet.

20
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,280
I've never tasted such sweet tea before.

21
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,400
That's right.

22
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,400
The sweetness of good tea

23
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,120
hides in bitterness.

24
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,960
Only when you make the tea

25
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,800
with your true heart

26
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,120
can it taste sweet.

27
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,040
Of course.

28
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,960
When you're in different moods,

29
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,560
the tea will

30
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:40,920
taste different, too.

31
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,880
Sir,

32
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,800
you're awesome.

33
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,200
Let me introduce him to you.

34
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:48,920
This is Mr. Kang Lu.

35
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,320
He's a great man.

36
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,480
From highbrow knowledge

37
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,200
to lowbrow knowledge,

38
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,360
he knows everything.

39
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,680
You flatter me.

40
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,440
Mr. Kang,

41
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,000
this is Su Nan.

42
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,600
Nice to meet you, Mr. Kang.

43
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,840
Have we

44
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,320
met somewhere?

45
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,280
I don't think so.

46
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,000
Then we're predestined to meet.

47
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,560
How?

48
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,760
By destiny.

49
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,320
Here.

50
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:20,720
Have some tea.

51
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,240
In my place,

52
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,160
feel free to do anything.

53
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,800
Make yourselves at home.

54
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,520
Yibei.

55
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,040
What? Just say it.

56
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,200
Look.

57
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:52,040
I took these photos
downstairs of our company.

58
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:57,720
Yibei,

59
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:00,600
did Su Nan really leave you for money?

60
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:01,560
Look at the car.

61
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,320
And this man is obviously rich.

62
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,640
I didn't know
she was such a vain creature.

63
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,560
How about

64
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,240
you have a relationship with Yaru?

65
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,240
(Gu Yibei)

66
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,440
Excuse me. I have to take this.

67
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,080
OK.

68
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:36,800
Hello,

69
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,520
Gu Yibei.

70
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,800
Su Nan, where are you?

71
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,640
I'm going to see you.

72
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,480
What's wrong with you?

73
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,520
This girl is

74
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:46,160
quite adorable.

75
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,320
Much better

76
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,640
than Jiang Lan.

77
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,840
You have good taste, man.

78
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,560
Don't make fun of me, Mr. Kang.

79
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,720
We're not a couple.

80
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,640
You're not now.

81
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,080
But you can be a couple.

82
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,600
Don't make fun of the girl.

83
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,600
OK. Enjoy the tea.

84
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,640
Sorry,

85
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,880
the subscriber you dialed is powered off.

86
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:21,840
Sorry,

87
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,080
the subscriber you dialed is powered off.

88
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,560
Hey, girl.

89
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,080
Why are you sure

90
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,360
that you were adopted

91
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,000
and your adoptive parents

92
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,960
didn't buy you from a human trafficker?

93
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,880
I'm quite straightforward.

94
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:41,800
No offense.

95
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,360
Here's the thing, Mr. Kang.

96
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,600
My mother told me about this
before she died.

97
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,080
So, I was adopted.

98
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,120
Do you have the adoption certificate?

99
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,440
In my opinion,

100
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:05,680
we should start

101
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,160
to check the orphanages.

102
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:08,920
Well,

103
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,760
I'll ask around for you.

104
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,960
And I'll let you know if I get anything.

105
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,800
I really appreciate it, Mr. Kang.

106
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:16,800
You're welcome.

107
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:17,600
Here.

108
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,360
Have some more tea.

109
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,440
(Please protect the environment
and Qinling Mountains.)

110
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:50,720
What's wrong with you?

111
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,480
In a bad mood?

112
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,280
You didn't talk during the trip.

113
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,480
If anything bothers you,
tell me about it.

114
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,480
I heard Xu Zhaolin
introduced his friend to you last night.

115
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,360
What have you got?

116
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,720
That man seemed to be very helpful.

117
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,200
You know what?

118
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,760
Xu Zhaolin is our big boss.

119
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:17,440
He is?

120
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:17,680
Yes.

121
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,440
Qiancheng Media is

122
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,200
a subsidiary of Dongye Group.

123
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,520
Oh, I see.

124
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,720
What do you think of Xu Zhaolin?

125
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:32,760
He's good.

126
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,840
Come on.

127
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,360
Be more specific.

128
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:37,800
He's...

129
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,800
He's warmhearted.

130
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:40,840
And

131
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,040
he's handsome, too.

132
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,600
Anyway,

133
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,720
he's an elegant gentleman.

134
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:49,760
I quite agree.

135
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,960
I think he is...

136
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:53,600
A...

137
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,120
A stylish gentleman.

138
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,520
What's more,

139
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,880
he's considerate.

140
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,160
A man of parts.

141
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:04,280
Also,

142
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,560
he's macho.

143
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,320
- Just like my...
- Prince Charming?

144
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:09,800
Exactly.

145
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,360
Mr. Xu,

146
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,640
Hao Jia said you were
her Prince Charming.

147
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,560
She adores you.

148
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,240
Don't text him.

149
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,440
You like him, huh?

150
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:19,960
I don't.

151
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,880
You like him, huh?

152
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,640
Don't tease me.

153
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:22,880
Come on.

154
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,240
Getting shy?

155
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:25,920
No.

156
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,220
