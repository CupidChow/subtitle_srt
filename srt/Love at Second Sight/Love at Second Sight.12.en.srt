Thank you, Mr. Xu.

What do you want me for?

Tell me.

62
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,240
Who would visit an orphanage?

63
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,640
Orphanage?

64
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,880
Someone who lost his child.

65
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,600
Anyone else?

66
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,400
Anyone else...

67
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,680
If someone

68

doesn't want his baby,

69
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,560
he'll send it to the orphanage, too.

70
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,720
You know what?

71
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,000
In my hometown,
a young couple had a baby

72
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,160
without getting married.

73
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,640
In case their family knew it,

74
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,360
they secretly sent the baby
to the orphanage.

75
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,320
Think about them.

76
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,080
Such terrible parents.

77
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,240
What?

78
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,680
You want to adopt a child?

79
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:15,800
No.

80
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,120
I saw Su Nan visit an orphanage.

81
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,120
Su Nan?

82
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,640
She visited an orphanage?

83
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,040
Did she have your baby

84
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,280
and give birth secretly?

85
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,440
What have you done, Gu Yibei?

86
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,520
Does she want to ask for money

87
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:39,560
because you're rich now?

88
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:46,800
Yibei,

89
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,440
if she doesn't want money,

90
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,520
you have to be responsible for her.

91
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:01,880
Su Nan.

92
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:03,200
Someone asked to see you.

93
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,360
Oh, OK.

94
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:15,880
Mr. Gu?

95
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,560
What do you want me for?

96
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,200
Why?

97
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,400
What do you want again?

98
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:31,880
Su Nan,

99
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,040
tell me.

100
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,640
Why did you

101
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,520
visit that orphanage?

102
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,000
You stalked me again?

103
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,440
Are you keeping something from me?

104
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,840
None of your business.

105
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:40,880
If you don't mind, I'll leave.

106
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:44,960
Su Nan,

107
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,480
were you

108
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
looking for someone in the orphanage?

109
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,520
Who do you think I was looking for?

110
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,920
For my lost sibling, of course.

111
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,680
It can't be my baby, huh?

112
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,720
I don't know.

113
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,960
You're thinking too much.

114
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,680
Even if I had a baby,

115
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,760
it was none of your business.

116
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:10,840
Su Nan,

117
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,160
I'm a man.

118
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,960
Don't make fun of the baby thing!

119
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,280
Gu Yibei,

120
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,560
listen.

121
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,800
I wasn't pregnant five years ago.

122
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,520
I didn't have your baby, either.

123
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,480
Don't worry

124
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,680

in a few years.
