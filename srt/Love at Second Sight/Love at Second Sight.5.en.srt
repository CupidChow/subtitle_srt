Don't worry.

16
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,200
I've asked my friends

17
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:31,280
to look for your biological parents.

18
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:32,760
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

19
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,160
You're welcome.

20
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,960
No offense,

21
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,560
but how did you know

22
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,440
you were not their daughter?

23
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:42,560
My...

24
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,280
My mother told me before she died.

25
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,200
Your adoptive mother?

26
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,920
Why do you want your real parents now?

27
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,400
Actually,

28
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,800
I eagerly want to know

29
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,000
what life my real parents are living.

30
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,880
But I also care about their feelings.

31
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,880
So,

32
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,040
I don't want to look for them

33
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,000
through media or programs.

34
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,400
It's very private, you know.

35
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,400
I don't want a lot of people to know it.

36
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:10,840
All right.

37
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,200
Don't worry.

38
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,040
In this case,

39
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,200
I'll keep the secret for you.

40
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,120
OK.

41
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,120
Have some tea.

42
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,040
You played hard

43
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,840
but didn't score at all.

44
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:25,360
Come on.

45
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,600
Watch this.

46
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,880
I just missed.

47
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,480
Yibei.

48
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,080
Yibei!

49
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,200
Your turn.

50
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:41,680
Hurry.

51
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:44,640
Yibei,

52
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:45,720
have some wine.

53
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,080
Thanks, Yaru.

54
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,680
It's mine. Go get some for yourself.

55
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:51,760
Oh.

56
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,960
Beautiful lady and good wine.

57
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,960
When can I finally enjoy them?

58
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,800
What's wrong with you?

59
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:03,640
You failed all the time.

60
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:05,960
Let me play with you.

61
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,360
Can you?

62
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:07,960
Yes, of course.

63
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:08,480
Come on.

64
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,560
Do you know the object ball?

65
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,280
The white one.

66
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:10,760
This.

67
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,280
And hit the red one.

68
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,320
Yibei.

69
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,320
Come.

70
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,080
OK.

71
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,040
Let me teach you.

72
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:28,920
Come on.

73
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,000
This is cheating.

74
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,000
You can't do that.

75
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,720
Why do you even target my ball?

76
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,840
Oh, I see.

77
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,840
I won't be the third wheel.

78
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:39,520
You guys

79
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,880
enjoy yourselves.

80
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:43,960
Yibei,

81
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,480
let's try again.

82
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,080
Come on.

83
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,200
Yibei,

84
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,560
who is the girl

85
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,120
on the rooftop?

86
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,320
You can play it now? Here you go.

87
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,200
I'm back.

88
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:23,600
There you are.

89
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,200
Jia.

90
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,320
There's a reunion this weekend.

91
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:27,960
Let's go together.

92
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,200
Reunion?

93
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:31,000
Of our classmates at college.

94
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:33,080
It's said to be held

95
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,040
in Greenshade Villa.

96
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,240
The scenery there is splendid.

97
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,040
Oh,

98
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,680
how's your work?

99
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,680
Don't mention it.

100
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,960
I was late on the first day.

101
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,280
But you left home very early.

102
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,600
I met Gu Yibei in the lift.

103
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,480
Why is he everywhere?

104
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,880
And our companies are
in the same building.

105
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,080
When I knew it, I wanted to resign.

106
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,120
But I can't.

107
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,800
It was so hard to get this job, anyway.

108
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:04,920
Oh.

109
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,680
Think about it.

110
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:07,800
What are you meant to be,

111
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,920
enemies to each other

112
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,960
or destined lovers?

113
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,400
Don't make fun of me.

114
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,520
How could you meet him there?

115
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,040
I'm exhausted.

116
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,080
Let me massage you.

117
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,840
(Minghua Hall)

118
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,520
Long time no see.

119
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:39,520
Cheers, everyone.

120
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,640
Let's clink glasses.

121
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,240
Cheers.

122
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:46,120
Oh.

123
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:46,800
Guys,

124
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,680
after graduation,

125
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,120
we went to different cities.

126
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,280
It's really hard

127
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,280
to get together here.

128
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,040
Tell me.

129
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,600
What jobs are you doing now?

130
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,560
Don't ask like that.

131
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,840
Hilarious.

132
00:05:58,200 --> 00:05:58,560
Hey,

133
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,680
never mind.

134
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,480
It's called

135
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,200
resource sharing.

136
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,000
Good point.

137
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:05,720
A toast to resource sharing.

138
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,080
Cheers.

139
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:26,960
Su Nan,

140
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,760
when you dated the cutest guy
of graduate school,

141
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,240
you were quite famous.

142
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,560
How are you doing now?

143
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:36,960
We...

144
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,200
We broke up years ago.

145
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,160
Why?

146
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,960
You were the couple we envied most.

147
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,160
Yeah, Su Nan.

148
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,760
What happened later?

149
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,440
Tell us about it.

150
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,080
Yeah, tell us.

151
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:50,760
Nothing happened.

152
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,680
Just enjoy the dishes.

153
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,520
Or they'll get cold.

154
00:06:59,200 --> 00:06:59,800
Hao Jia,

155
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,720
long time no see.

156
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,320
Shall we drink?

157
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,640
Cross the glasses.

158
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,480
Yeah, do it.

159
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:09,920
Cross your glasses.

160
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,680
- You used to be a couple.
- Do it.

161
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:12,640
Yeah.

162
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,840
They should

163
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,720
- cross their glasses.
- Cross them.

164
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,400
- Cross your glasses.
- Cross your glasses.

165
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,480
- Nice.
- Bravo.

166
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,080
Nice.

167
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,480
Guys,

168
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,200
who can be the next couple?

169
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,080
Xiaoyi.

170
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,720
You two had some romance at college.

171
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,400
We didn't.

172
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,800
You should drink.

173
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,000
Go ahead.

174
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,120
Drink, drink.

175
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,080
Come on, Xiaoyi.

176
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,040
Cross your glasses.

177
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,640
Do it.

178
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,680
You have to do it.

179
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,200
- Cross your glasses.
- Cross your glasses.

180
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:50,960
Nice!

181
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,280
Honey?

182
00:07:58,760 --> 00:07:59,600
What are you doing here?

183
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,120
We're... having a reunion.

184
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,840
Honey, why did you splash it on her?

185
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,440
She's my classmate.

186
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,040
Zhang Lei,

187
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,240
you said you would visit
the bowling gym with your superior.

188
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,360
- Let me explain...
- Is this the bowling gym?

189
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,720
This is a reunion.

190
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,600
How many times have you done this?

191
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,640
Can't we argue back home?

192
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,840
You keep doing this.

193
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,120
It's not the first time.

194
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,480
Tomorrow, let's get divorced.

195
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,200
OK!

196
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,200
I'll go out for some fresh air.

197
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,840
