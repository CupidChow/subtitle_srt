Qiancheng Media has taken

16
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,200
nearly half of
the individual flow terminals.

17
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,800
What on earth are you worried about?

18
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,880
What I want isn't the quantity,

19
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,320
but the actual flow.

20
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,200
No terminal should be
the white elephant!

21
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,080
Come in.

22
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:32,920
Ms. Jiang,

23
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:33,760
coffee for you.

24
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:42,720
Su Nan?

25
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,680
Mr. Xu?

26
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,240
What?

27
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,600
You know each other?

28
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,640
You work here?

29
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,800
Yes, I work on new media planning.

30
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:52,480
All right.

31
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:53,480
Leave us.

32
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,840
We've got a meeting.

33
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,080
Why did you tell me
when you played games again?

34
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,080
What are you doing here?

35
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,400
Where else could I be?

36
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,280
If our friends hadn't told me,

37
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,360
I still wouldn't know it.

38
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,280
When they saw you in the game,

39
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,840
they thought it was a duplicate player
or someone stole your account,

40
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,200
until you fought everyone off.

41
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,000
What's wrong?

42
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,640
Feeling depressed?

43
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,160
I guess I'm right.

44
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,640
Or you wouldn't have vented
your depression in the game world.

45
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,120
Song Cenmo,

46
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,680
I can make you feel depressed, too.

47
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,960
I'm not scared.

48
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,360
Don't think I don't know.

49
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,120
You and Su Nan got back together.

50
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:04,440
I saw that.

51
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,120
Unless you have something serious,

52
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,960
get out of here.

53
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,240
Gu Yibei, are you insane?

54
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,160
I think

55
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,880
you should focus on something serious.

56
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,320
What's the argument about? Quite fierce.

57
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,240
There you are.

58
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,400
I brought a document.

59
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,240
The review comment
on the marketing proposal.

60
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,760
Yaru is such a beautiful lady around you.

61
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,080
But you never cherish her.

62
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:40,920
Fine, I'll leave.

63
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:41,600
Bye-bye.

64
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,880
You could have talked nicely.

65
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,520
Why did you quarrel like kids?

66
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,080
Song Cenmo just never grows up.

67
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:51,800
He asked for that.

68
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,120
You have to sign the review comment

69
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,600
before I make a contract.

70
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,240
Don't you even check it?

71
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,720
You've reviewed it

72
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:03,840
and I trust you.

73
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,680
Su Nan.

74
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,000
Mr. Xu?

75
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,320
I'll wait for you downstairs after work.

76
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:23,080
I have something to tell you.

77
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,080
Oh, OK.

78
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:24,680
See you after work.

79
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,040
OK.

80
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:34,600
Ms. Jiang, you asked to see me?

81
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,720
Our water cooler doesn't work, right?

82
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:37,520
No.

83
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,880
Are you sure?

84
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,960
Oh, it's broken.

85
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,160
Su Nan, I gotta go. Bye-bye.

86
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:47,760
Bye-bye.

87
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,200
Bye-bye.

88
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:17,320
Su Nan,

89
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:18,520
don't go yet.

90
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:20,920
The water cooler doesn't work.

91
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,880
Go repair it.

92
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:23,080
Ms. Jiang,

93
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,120
don't we need a maintenance man?

94
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,520
Maintenance men are off duty.

95
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,200
If you don't repair it,

96
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,680
we'll have no drinking water tomorrow.

97
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,320
Take care of it.

98
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,400
There you are.

99
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:25,800
Mr. Xu?

100
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,560
I'm sorry.

101
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,720
Still waiting for me?

102
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:30,760
What are you doing here?

103
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,600
Working overtime?

104
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,400
Well,

105
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,120
Ms. Jiang asked me to do this
before I knocked off.

106
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:39,640
To repair the water cooler?

107
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,760
If I don't repair it,

108
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,040
we'll have no drinking water tomorrow.

109
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:46,520
Fine.

110
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:47,760
Take your time.

111
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,400
I... I'll finish it fast.

112
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:20,800
Can you repair it?

113
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,120
I...

114
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,240
I learned semiconductor in high school.

115
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,440
Semiconductor?

116
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,840
How can that help?

117
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,640
Let me help you.

118
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,840
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

119
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:35,360
Screwdriver.

120
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:42,840
Oh,

121
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,680
why were you in Ms. Jiang's office?

122
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,320
For cooperation?

123
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,920
I came for an inspection.

124
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,120
Inspection?

125
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,720
Your company is a subsidiary
of Dongye Group.

126
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,360
You...

127
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,880
Let's finish soon.

128
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,560
I'll take you to meet someone.

129
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,600
I just need to set the pipe.

130

Back cover.

131
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,080
The cover.

132
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,160
Oh.

133
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:42,720
Let me do it.

134
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:43,000
Oh.

135
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,480
OK.

136
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,480
