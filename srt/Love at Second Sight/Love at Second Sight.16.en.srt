15
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,400
Dad?

16
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:26,400
You...

17
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,280
Nan.

18
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:28,680
Why are you...

19
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,040
I miss you, Nan.

20
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,080
Dad, you...

21
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:38,800
Nan,

22
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,760
I had a reduced sentence for two years.

23
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,760
During that,

24
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,160
I was released on medical furlough.

25
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,240
What do you want me for?

26
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,080
Nothing, actually.

27
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,760
I was just released

28
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,120
and haven't seen you for years.

29
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,280
I came to see how you're doing now.

30
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,480
I'm doing fine.

31
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,720
If you don't mind, I have to go.

32
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:56,440
Wait, Nan.

33
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,440
I lost my mind that year.

34
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,040
And your mother died many years ago.

35
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,200
I'm thinking

36
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,880
if we can live a good life together.

37
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,160
I've corrected myself.

38
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:13,960
Look.

39
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,960
Last year, when I was working
on the construction site,

40
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,280
I fell from high.

41
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,360
Look.

42
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,640
I broke my leg.

43
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,200
I thought

44
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,760
it was a heaven-sent punishment.

45
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,120
You're everything I have now.

46
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:31,480
Dad,

47
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,480
I really appreciate the home
you gave me when I was little.

48
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,880
But this is all I can give you now.

49
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,840
I don't mean to get money from you.

50
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,640
I want to live with you.

51
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,920
I'm living a good life alone.

52
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,400
Take this.

53
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,640
All my savings are in this bank card.

54
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,360
Reverse my birthday
and it's the password.

55
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,120
Nan!

56
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,400
Nan!

57
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,080
960928.

58
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,080
Dad, Mom.

59
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,200
I'm admitted!

60
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:42,800
Admitted?

61
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:43,920
To what?

62
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,840
I'm admitted.

63
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,360
Anping University?

64
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,200
She's admitted!

65
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,640
Look.

66
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,240
And it's a famous university!

67
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,480
You're awesome, my daughter!

68
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,440
We have to celebrate this.

69
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,640
We'll invite our relatives and friends

70
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,080
to big dinners.

71
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,200
Yes, yes.

72
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,280
Big dinners.

73
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,080
(Letter of Admission)
Good, good.

74
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,200
(Go buy me a cup of coffee.)

75
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,920
Oh, wait.

76
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,160
Sorry.

77
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:55,960
Look how late it is.

78
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,640
But you all look sleepy.

79
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,480
Having breakfast or chatting.

80
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,200
Don't you know it's working time?

81
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:07,160
Someone hasn't come yet, huh?

82
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,320
Who?

83
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,000
Ms. Jiang,

84
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,200
that's Su Nan's seat.

85
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:14,760
HR.

86
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,120
Write down Su Nan's absence for a day

87
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:19,960
and cut her bonus for full attendance!

88
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:28,800
Ms. Jiang,

89
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,120
here's your coffee.

90
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,240
Keep it to yourself.

91
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,280
Su Nan.

92
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,960
Are you getting close to Mr. Xu lately?

93
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,640
We're just friends.

94
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,240
I think you should keep a low profile.

95
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,480
Low profile?

96
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:13,800
What does that mean?

97
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,120
You don't know, huh?

98
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,600
Actually,

99
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:18,840
Jiang Lan

100
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:20,000
used to be

101
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,480
Mr. Xu's girlfriend.

102
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,760
Mr. Xu dumped her a long time ago.

103
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,560
But she wants to get back to him.

104
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,360
So when she saw...

105
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,160
Wait, wait.

106
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,760
Mr. Xu and I are just friends.

107
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,800
And I only work here for the moment.

108
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,960
I won't stay for too long.

109
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:36,840
Oh.

110
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,080
Is that so?

111
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:55,160
What?

112
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,400
Have you got anything?

113
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,280
I consulted relevant institutions.

114
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,960
If we don't even know
the parents' names,

115
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,040
it's nearly impossible to find them.

116
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,680
So,

117
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,360
I can do nothing about it.

118
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,280
What else can I do?

119
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,560
There's another solution.

120
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,160
Post your friend's information online

121
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,840
so that netizens will help.

122
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,640
We may have unexpected results.

123
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:22,240
But of course,

124
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,200
we can't do this without her approval.

125
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:25,880
No.

126
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:27,280
Absolutely no.

127
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,360
Fine.

128
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,040
I'll think about it.

129
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,360
Get to your business.

130
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:35,920
OK.

131
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,360
Ms. Jiang.

132
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:49,720
What?

133
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:50,680
Did you tell her my point?

134
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:51,920
Yes.

135
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,560
She said she wouldn't be here too long.

136
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,160
It's wise of her.

137
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,600
Get back to work.
