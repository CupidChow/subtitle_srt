00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:16,080
15 years ago,

2
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,080
I still

3
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,900
can not forget that moment.

4
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,640
Why? All of this…

5
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,520
Who? Who did that?

6
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:44,000
With a single word…

7
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,520
That was Sakura's mother.

8
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,140
I was despoiled everything.

9
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,040
And meaning of life

10
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,500
is the only thing

11
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,700
left for me.

12
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:05,790
(Ishigawa Prefecture - Komatsu city)

13
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,620
- It was a good tea!
- Thank you for your interest.

14
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,540
Today, I specially have prepared
an interesting sweet for you.

15
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:27,460
Interesting?

16
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:31,520
I invited my favorite Japanese sweets maker
to make it for me right now.

17
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,840
I asked her to make a sweet
with Satomi-san's imagination.

18
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,900
Me?

19
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,640
Right? Nao-san?

20
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,900
Yes! Mayu-san, just leave it to me.

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,260
Please enjoy the sweet.

22
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,240
Woa~ A bird?

23
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,320
- This is so cute!
- It's the bird of spring, the "White-eye".

24
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,480
(The white-eye)

25
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,950
(The white-eye)
The twitter of the white-eye is so beautiful,

26
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:05,700
that it has been called the "golden soprano".

27
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,460
"It was a beautiful twitter",
I heard a lot from the customer.

28
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,500
So I came up with this sweet.

29
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,280
That sounds great. Nao-san.

30
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,280
Satomi-san is a vocalist.

31
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,280
She is going to participate in a competition.

32
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,880
So, please point the beak

33
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:24,060
to the lucky direction and enjoy it.

34
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,860
It's so delicious!

35
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,480
My own special sweet.

36
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,420
Can you make it for any customer?

37
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:44,800
Yes. With red bean paste and
feelings for that customer.

38
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,540
That is...

39
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,800
my - Hanaoka Nao's - sweets.

40
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:57,700
I really want to ask Nao-san for help.

41
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,760
Sweets as gifts?

42
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,720
Is that for upcoming wedding of Mayu-san?

43
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,960
Yes, since it’s a once-in-a-lifetime ceremony

44
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:11,140
I want my gifts to be the best they can be.

45
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,220
So I want to ask Nao-san for help.

46
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,840
Congratulatory sweets...

47
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,540
Please let me do it!

48
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,540
Yes!

49
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,080
But, I have some problem...

50
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,700
He is the eldest son of the head of the family.

51
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,260
So, it seems like he want to ask
his favourite shop to do it for him.

52
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:30,560
I see...

53
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,260
We're going to have a tea party with both families,

54
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,280
and we'll have sweets from both.

55
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:38,720
Then we'll decide to choose which one.

56
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,800
It's like a competition…

57
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,040
I'm sorry.

58
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,020
A sweet competition…

59
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,520
I still have a chance, right?

60
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:58,420
I'd like to do it.
It's so great to serve many people.

61
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,200
Really?

62
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,300
Really!

63
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,640
Is that also a Japanese sweets shop in Komatsu?

64
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:06,420
Ah, no, it's a shop of Kanazawa.

65
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:09,800
It's the famous Kougetsuan.

66
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,080
At that time, I still did not know...

67
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,320
Kougetsuan?

68
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,580
Once again, that person

69
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,140
will mess up

70
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,700
my life.

(15 years ago)

75
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,350
(15 years ago)
I met him, Tsubaki-san in a Spring.

76
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:12,880
(Takatsuki)
I met him, Tsubaki-san in a Spring

77
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,090
(Takatsuki)
when I was 5 years old.

78
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,020
It was when I was taken to the shop

79
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,020
where my mother, a Japanese sweets maker,

80
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,140
was to work as a live-in worker.

81
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:23,500
My name is Okura Yuriko.

82
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,200
This is my daughter, Nao.

83
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,200
Ah, that's Sakura!

84
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:29,850
Tsubaki -san, that's pronounced "O".

85
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:32,500
(Okura Nao)
Tsubaki -san, that's pronounced "O".

86
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:33,780
Nao-chan.

87
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,780
But Sakura is good, too.

88
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:36,960
It's same with mine.

89
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,480
The name of the spring.

90
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:45,640
In Kanazawa, Ishikawa Prefecture.

91
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,350
(Kougetsuan)
There is a traditional Japanese sweets shop

92
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:52,120
with a history of 400 years.

93
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,420
It's Kougetsuan.

94
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,780
Sakura! Sakura!

95
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:03,740
The only son, Tsubaki was friendly, cheerful.

96
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:07,940
I was weak and sick,

97
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,100
and he looked so dazzling.

98
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:11,100
It's beautiful, isn't it?

99
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,620
Sakura blossoms in full bloom?

100
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:17,340
Yesterday, I went to see it with my father.

101
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:20,260
I took this picture so that Sakura could see it.

102
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,340
Nao also want to see Sakura right.

103
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:27,340
I'm sorry. I couldn't go.

104
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,860
It's alright.

105
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:33,920
If I get asthma again, mom'll be in trouble.

106
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:35,820
Nao.

107
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:40,860
At that time, I saw everything in grey.

108
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,860
That's right!

109
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,100
Let's make sweets!

110
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,560
Sweets?

111
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,420
Yeah, in case of that, we can make it indoor.

112
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:53,520
That sounds good, I will teach you.

113
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,860
Just slowly turning

114
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:02,240
Yes, be gentle.

115
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,220
Yes, yes, just slowly.

116
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,140
I made it!

117
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,260
That's Sakura sweet!

118
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,700
It's a beautiful pink.

119
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,140
Pink? Pink of Sakura.

120
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,300
It's mine.

121
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:45,820
It's the moment that my world was coloured.

122
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,000
Nao.

123
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,140
You can't do that, in a place like this.

124
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:02,440
Woaaa, it's amazing!

125
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,660
Tsubaki-san.

126
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,360
Look at these.
They 're all in different shapes.

127
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,400
Not one of them is the same.

128
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:14,980
It's amazing!
Sakura can make any kind of sweet.

129
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:17,160
So, when I grow up,

130
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:20,180
can I still stay here and make sweets?

131
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:25,120
Yes, when I become the owner of the shop,
I'll make Sakura be the best craftsperson.

132
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,380
I'll always be with Tsubaki.

133
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,480
Tsubaki.

134
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:41,720
Father.

135
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,560
How many times do I have to tell you that
you can't go into an employee's room?

136
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,600
You're the heir to the Kougetsuan family.

137
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,600
It's not a good thing.

138
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,920
I understood.

139
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,680
- Mom.
- Huh?

140
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,400
Can I stay here forever?

141
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:16,420
Can I stay here and make sweets
with Tsubaki forever?

142
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,700
Nao.

143
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:24,260
Give me your hands.

144
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,880
I'll give you good things.

145
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,620
Tadaa.

146
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:33,780
You can make sweets in any place.

147
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:37,360
So, if you want to make it,

148
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,440
I want you continue making it.

149
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,440
If you do that,

150
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,460
you can stay with me and Tsubaki-kun forever.

151
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,380
Really?

152
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,260
Really!

153
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,300
Sakura flower is Nao.

154
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:54,720
subaki leaf die-cut will be given to Tusbaki-kun.

155
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,720
Yes!

156
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,120
Looking back, It had been

157
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:03,320
the happinest year of my life.

158
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:27,220
My memory of that morning
is unclear in some parts.

159
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,220
But

160
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,840
the tsubaki flowers blooming
all over the garden

161
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,140
and the scene of it.

162
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,280
I can still see it in my eyes.

163
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,280
Eh?

164
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:09,060
Master! Master!

165
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:13,140
Why? All of these matter...

166
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:15,920
Is that true? Tsubaki-san!

167
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,140
Did you really see someone in your father's room?

168
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:25,540
Who? Who did that?

169
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,420
That was Sakura's mother.

170
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:56,980
Can I have a word with you?

171
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,540
What? I'm...

172
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:02,040
Mom! Mom!

173
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,040
- Nao!
- Mom!

174
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:08,750
- Mom! Mom! Mom!
- Nao! Nao!

175
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,020
Mom!

176
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,500
That day,

177
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:24,220
I was thrown out of the Kougetsuan.

178
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:30,350
(Now)

179
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:34,750
(Ikkyou Tou)

180
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,300
Hanaoka!

181
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,540
About the Sayama family's gift,
You said no?

182
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,540
That was a waste.

183
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:47,120
The theme was "Sakura", right?

184
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:57,440
You're so useless.

185
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,640
It would be critical for
a Japanese sweets maker.

186
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:09,200
How can you be afraid of the red color.

187
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,240
Sempai, I love this die-cut.

188
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,300
- Huh?
- If using it for "flower rafts",

189
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,420
it could be like in a fantasy land.

190
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,740
Can I use it?

191
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,960
I thought about giving up many times.

192
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:33,960
But...

193
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:38,280
It's only when I'm making sweets

194
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,460
that I feel I'm not alone.

195
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,480
It's a beautiful pink.

196
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:57,100
Because, this is the only meaning of life
that I have left.

197
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,040
No matter what else I lose,

198
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,640
but this is the only thing.

199
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,260
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you have to leave.

200
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,660
But, why?

201
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,700
If there's a problem, I'll fix it!

202
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:19,880
I still want to study here more.

203
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,540
Like, how to cook the beans for the best taste.

204
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,320
Or it's the consistency of the dough for a Manju,

205
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,320
or the baking of a Kintsuba.
I have not done yet.

206
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,560
I want to know more about Japanese sweets.

207
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,380
I want to make them!

208
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,380
Please!

209
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,420
There's no other place where I can live and work.

210
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,580
Please!

211
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,480
But we're inconvenienced, too.

212
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,400
This is sent to us every day.

213
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,700
In this day and age,
it's easy to spread the word, isn't it?

214
00:14:55,150 --> 00:14:57,050
(Hanaoka Nao's mother is a killer.)

215
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:58,650
(Killer)

216
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,970
(Hanaoka Nao's mother is a killer.)

217
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,020
You can make sweets in any place.

218
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,600
If you want to make it,

219
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,520
I want you continue making it.

220
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:47,700
(Mother)

221
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:49,750
(Killer)

222
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,860
You're getting soaked.

223
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:12,180
Finally I can meet you,
Hanaoka Nao-san.

224
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,360
Since you'd changed your name,

225
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,480
it was hard to find you.

226
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:20,540
Who?

227
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:22,980
This is...

228
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,820
I was asked to give it to you

229
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:28,180
when you are over 20 years old.

230
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,940
This is a letter from you mother.

231
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,250
(To Nao)

232
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,120
Who are you?

233
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:50,640
I'm just a fan of your mother's sweets.

234
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,680
From my mom?

235
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,660
But mom was...

236
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:09,150
(To Nao)

237
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,580
Mayu-san, sorry for the suddenness.

238
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,500
About the tea party,

239
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:37,540
may I still join now?

240
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:45,380
I want to keep making my own sweets.

241
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,960
I won't let anyone disturb me.

242
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,850
(Tea ceremony Umeda ryu)
I'm really glad that Nao-san agreed to do it.

243
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,680
I'm really glad that Nao-san agreed to do it.

244
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:09,120
Can you wait in your room
untill everything is ready?

245
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:11,340
The people from Kougetsuan are also there.

246
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,000
It's all right.

247
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,920
After 15 years,

248
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,980
nobody over there knows me.

249
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,640
Nao-san, let me introduce.

250
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,620
This is Takatsuki Tsubaki-san
from Kougetsuan.

251
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,620
See you later, Nao-san.

252
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,320
Close it quickly.

253
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,080
The bean paste will be dried out.

254
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,360
That was Sakura's mother.

255
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,840
Tsubaki.

256
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,940
Are you my competitor today?

257
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,040
Excuse me.

258
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,040
Tsubaki-san, the kitchen is ready.

259
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,040
I understand.

260
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,540
Big, bony hands,

261
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,440
his back, his voice,

262
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:53,360
very different with Tsubaki I'd known.

263
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:55,440
What about me?

264
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:58,880
Have you noticed me or not?

265
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:04,540
Don't make wasted noise, amateur.

266
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:13,620
- Calm down, calm down.
- Hironari-san.

267
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,980
It's a beautiful day.

268
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,900
It would be great to have a cup of tea here.

269
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:22,460
I'll do it every day.

270
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,480
I look forward to being with you.

271
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,320
That's my pleasure.

272
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:35,320
I really want to ask Nao-san for a help.

273
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:40,700
Hah... that's right...

274
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:43,920
I can't run away.

275
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:57,040
Today, I'm making congratulatory sweets.

276
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,360
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

277
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:32,100
I'm Takatsuki from Kougetsuan.

278
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:35,420
My name is...Hanaoka.

279
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:40,900
Hanaoka-san? I haven't heard about you.

280
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,740
Which sweet shall we start with?

281
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,800
With deepest respect...

282
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:49,680
Kougetsuan has been working
with Umeda-san for many years.

283
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:53,680
I couldn't report to the shop
if I've been left for later.

284
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,900
That's true.
So let's start with Kougetsuan.

285
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,680
Thank you very much.

286
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:04,260
I'm looking forward to
having sweets from Kougetsuan.

287
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,740
But, this person is such a young craftsman.

288
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:11,260
I would have preferred a more experienced one.

289
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,260
This again...

290
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,360
What a delicate sweet!

291
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,360
The color are wonderful.

292
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:33,120
All three are a slightly different color.

293
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:38,860
The name of the sweet is "Usuzumi Zakura".

294
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:42,420
(Usuzumi Zakura)

295
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:45,420
"Usuzumi Zakura" is a special sakura.

296
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,400
Light red when in bud.

297
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,020
It will be white when in full bloom.

298
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:53,660
In the end, it'll be like a pale ink.

299
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,080
It changes its color and disperse.

300
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:00,400
For a once-in-a-lifetime celebration of marriage,

301
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,800
a plain cherry blossom would not do.

302
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:07,740
Unless it is uniquely gorgeous.

303
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:11,680
No need to say "beautiful".

304
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,060
Otherwise...

305
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,020
It is not Japanese sweet.

306
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,320
It's so great.

307
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:28,100
It's unbelievable that such
subtle colours can be created.

308
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,820
It's not just about the colors.

309
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:33,100
A well-proportioned shape,

310
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,580
beautiful, technically skilled stamping.

311
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:38,560
Every line seems to be alive.

312
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,220
This is Tsubaki's sweet.

313
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,640
Hanaoka-san.

314
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:45,660
May I have some of your sweets?

315
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:46,780
Yes!

316
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,040
Over here.

317
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:55,480
Hanaoka-san, The theme is Sakura.

318
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:56,620
Yes.

319
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:58,280
But, green color...

320
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:03,480
The name of sweet is "Hazakura".

321
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,480
(Hazakura)

322
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,140
It is true that sakura are
at their most spectacular when they bloom,

323
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:16,140
which can turn the whole area pink.

324
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:20,820
However, a spring storm has blown in,

325
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,880
and the beautiful flowers have fallen.

326
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,880
The leaves are growing
thicker and greener every day,

327
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,220
as if they've been waiting for it.

328
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:31,280
Eventually, the new season will arrive.

329
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:38,860
I hope that as the years go by,
you two will always be together.

330
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,520
I wish you many years of happiness.

331
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,540
Congratulations!

332
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:46,720
Mayu-san.

333
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,240
Nao-san.

334
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:59,740
This one, Sakura is in the bean paste.

335
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:00,960
That's true.

336
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,780
It's delicious.

337
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,720
That makes sense.

338
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:10,180
Is it true that
"happiness is found in the everyday"?

339
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:13,340
I'll ask her to make sweets
for our tea party next time.

340
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,580
Yes.

341
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:22,240
Thank you so much.

342
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:27,060
It's an interesting idea.

343
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:33,220
We'll contact with you for the results.

344
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,300
I understand.

345
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:47,740
If I win this competition,
I'll still be in this world.

346
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,820
In the world of Japanese sweets, just like my mom.

347
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,300
It was great.

348
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:56,500
I think I'll choose Kougetsuan for the gifts.

349
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,800
Father!

350
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:01,220
Mayu, you are the daughter
of a traditional family, you understand right.

351
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:06,720
As long as we are in this world,
we can't go against Kougetsuan.

352
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,500
That's...

353
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:58,120
(To Nao)

354
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:06,360
"Returning home... under the leaves
of sakura leaves... salt on the fish"

355
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:12,960
Will you

356
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,700
marry me?

357
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,160
Will you

358
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,740
marry me?

359
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:55,500
Just a joke. Forget it.

360
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,060
It's OK.

361
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,600
The person I thought I'd never see again.

362
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:13,600
(To Nao)

363
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:18,850
(Dear Nao, I didn't do it.)

364
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:30,780
Just do it...Marriage.

365
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:38,300
I don't know what's wrong with me.

366
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,440
Are you serious?

367
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,440
You too?

368
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,060
What's your name?

369
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:51,820
Ah, that's Sakura.

370
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:55,740
Sakura, Sakura, Sakura.

371
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:58,660
My name is Nao.

372
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:03,520
Hanaoka Nao.

373
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:08,760
So,

374
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:10,920
Nao,

375
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:15,260
if you're serious about getting married,

376
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,720
three days later, on 26th, at noon,

377
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,280
come to Kougetsuan.

378
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,920
Come or not is up to you.

379
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,160
But, if you come,

380
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,200
you can not come back.

381
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:38,940
And don't forget to bring a souvenir.

382
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:44,820
Tsubaki doesn't remember
anything about me.

383
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,960
I still can not forget

384
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,780
my happiness was taken away.

385
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:57,220
By a word from Tsubaki

386
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:02,160
I've been alone since that day.

387
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:03,480
(Dear Nao, I didn't do it.)

388
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,360
I hate Tsubaki.

389
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:09,900
I can't believe
I'm marrying someone like that.

390
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,120
This is ridiculous.

391
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:18,920
But...

392
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,180
Nao-san.

393
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,460
I am sorry

394
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:26,260
about the gifts...

395
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:28,800
Mayu-san, could you do me a favour?

396
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:35,400
Thank you very much, Umeda-sama.

397
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,360
You're welcomed.

398
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,440
I look forward to
a long and successful relationship with you.

399
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,640
Please excuse me.

400
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:49,920
Okami-san, how was the result?

401
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,360
Has he won?

402
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,620
Of course.

403
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:56,520
It's the sweets made by the next head of our family.

404
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:02,920
Yes!!!

405
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,140
Tomioka, prepare for it.

406
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,340
Yes! I understand!

407
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:10,060
- You too!
- I am sorry!

408
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:37,920
That's right, it makes sense.

409
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,800
Is it OK? Tsubaki?

410
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,060
One day you're going to inherit this place.

411
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:43,620
Yes!

412
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,120
Nao-san.

413
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:01,740
I'm sorry, Mayu-san. I didn't mean to be rude.

414
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:04,200
I bought some sweets from Kougetsuan.

415
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,640
(Flower Raft / Rapeseed / Monaka)

416
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,700
"Rapeseed" in "flower raft".

417
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,700
Inside is famous "Monaka".

418
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,820
You like it, didn't you.

419
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:15,820
Kougetsuan sweets.

420
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,460
I just wanted to be sure.

421
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,060
I'd like to take it.

422
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,560
I'd like to take it.

423
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:33,880
Eh?

424
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:38,540
The taste has been changed, Kogetsuan.

425
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:41,700
Uhm, That's true, if say so.

426
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:46,540
The first time I ate it,
I was very impressed.

427
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:48,660
It's been 15 years ago.

428
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:50,320
15 years ago?

429
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:51,920
It was so delicious.

430
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,680
Those were sweets from
when my mum used to make them.

431
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,320
Huh? Nao-san?

432
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,660
I'm so sorry.

433
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,400
I was so happy.

434
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:18,300
How disappointed you must have been to have.

435
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:23,340
Your love of making sweets
taken away in an instant.

436
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:28,320
-Mom! Mom! Mom!
- Nao! Nao!

437
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:30,340
- I didn't know anything.
- Mom! Mom!

438
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:33,650
- Mom! Mom!
- I was just making sweets.

439
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,970
From today, Nao-chan...

440
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:50,400
(Orphanage Taiyou's House)

441
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,500
(Orphanage Taiyou's House)
is going to live here.

442
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,080
No! I want to see my mom.

443
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,800
Your mother is...

444
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,900
You can't meet her.

445
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:03,860
Mom! Mom! Mom!

446
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:07,060
During the investigation,
he suddenly collapsed and...

447
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,980
(Kougetsu)
After all, we don't know the motive, do we?

448
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:13,240
But, Yuriko-san's fingerprints
were found on the murder weapon.

449
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:15,240
There was an eyewitness, too.

450
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:18,760
Her face looked so kind, but too scary.

451
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,680
Those were my mom's complaints.

452
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,480
I have to find the truth.

453
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,560
What really happened?

454
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,040
(Kougetsuan)

455
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,620
(Kougetsuan)
That day, in this place...

456
00:34:53,420 --> 00:34:55,800
You can't go back.

457
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,920
Welcome to our shop.

458
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:16,480
I miss this.

459
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,380
Welcome to our shop.

460
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,920
May I help you?

461
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,400
Is Tsubaki-san here?

462
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:28,240
My name is Hanaoka Nao.

463
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:31,360
Tsubaki-san told me to come here.

464
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:36,320
Ah, you're... that day...

465
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,360
Please come here, this way.

466
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,580
Ah, My name

467
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,380
is Jojima and I'm an intern.

468
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:53,360
Please go this way.

469
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,780
Corridor leading to the main house.

470
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,760
I remember this air.

471
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:04,020
The sacred air as if
entering the realm of this God.

472
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:05,860
This fresh air...

473
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,500
Finally I'm back.

474
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,200
Oi, Abesugi, what are you doing?

475
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:11,880
I'm sorry!

476
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,920
We don't have time. Hurry up!

477
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,600
Yama-san, the red beans are ready.

478
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,200
Oi, Is the beans paste finished?

479
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,260
I'm preparing now.

480
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:22,000
Watch out!

481
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,140
Today, we've been a bit busy.

482
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,140
Let's go!

483
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,040
At the end of this corridor is

484
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,320
that garden.

485
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:37,240
Ah. This way!

486
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:38,620
Yes.

487
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:44,940
Woa. The ceremony has just started.

488
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:50,620
Now Kougetsuan is safe.

489
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:51,920
After all, the partner

490
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,060
is one of Japan's best ryokan.

491
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:54,740
She's the daughter of Haseya-san.

492
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:57,420
I think they want to do more business.

493
00:36:59,060 --> 00:36:59,860
What?

494
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,140
What are you thinking about?

495
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,120
Ah...

496
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,500
Who?

497
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:31,340
Could you accept my gift?

498
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,480
I'm not going to back down.

499
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:38,380
You! We're in the middle of the ceremony!

500
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,400
Who is that?

501
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,440
Yes!

502
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,580
Excuse me.

503
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:44,340
Wait!

504
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,080
She is my guest.

505
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,740
So, what about the gift?

506
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:04,800
Here!

507
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,960
This is Youkan.

508
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,180
Youkan?

509
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:12,460
Wedding can't be celebrated with black youkan!

510
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,420
There's nothing inside.

511
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:27,350
What's the name of sweet?

512
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,200
It's "Shingetsu".

513
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:34,520
(Shingetsu)

514
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,560
(Shingetsu)
Moonlight night,

515
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,560
especially the full moon,

516
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,780
it's even more beautiful.

517
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,780
I also put chestnuts into youkan.

518
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:46,760
It is a golden glow floating in jet black.

519
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:50,800
But, in the moonless night,

520
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,480
the twinkling light of the stars
looks more beautiful.

521
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,120
The flowers become more and more fragrant.

522
00:38:57,300 --> 00:39:01,740
The night shows its true nature in all richness.

523
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,040
And this youkan,

524
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:07,540
I want you to enjoy the taste of youkan itself.

525
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,840
That's what I thought.

526
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,640
Come and have a taste.

527
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:18,980
The moonless night is a new moon.

528
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,160
Even if it's moonless.

529
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:25,740
The world of Japanese sweets is beautiful
even without Kougetsuan.

530
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:34,220
So this shop isn't special.

531
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:34,740
Yes.

532
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,100
Kougetsuan now is

533
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,300
not special.

534
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:44,420
- It's so rude.
- Get her out of here!

535
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:50,940
You're interesting.

536
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:59,460
I'm going to marry this person.

537
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,060
I'm really out of my mind.

538
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:10,780
He's the most hateful person in the world.

539
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,320
But....I can not go back.

540
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:33,600
Are you going to marry this woman?

541
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:35,700
I won't let you do that!

542
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,040
You disgrace my daughter!

543
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:39,880
Father.

544
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,600
How much do you think
I paid in the name of returning the betrothal?

545
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,620
Please stop it. Father.

546
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,420
Haseya-san!

547
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,740
If you make a fuss like this,

548
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,140
it will damage the name of Haseya,

549
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:55,880
a company that sells dignity and trust.

550
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:58,140
Would you please

551
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:00,540
let me handle this situation?

552
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:03,180
If you say so...

553
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:06,440
Thank you so much.

554
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:07,660
This person,

555
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,740
the landlady of Kougetsuan,

556
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,840
Tsubaki's mother.

557
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:18,600
I don't think I saw her much as a kid.

558
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,320
I don't really remember her face.

559
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,140
Tsubaki-san.

560
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:30,440
Are you serious? What you said earlier!

561
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,520
It's true.

562
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:40,380
Don't be so selfish! You're a disgrace.

563
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,580
You want to be on your own
as soon as possible, right?

564
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,160
Isn't that why I'm getting married?

565
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,900
Choose your partner carefully!

566
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:53,480
It's very important for Kougetsuan.

567
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:57,060
There will be no more
support from Haseya-san.

568
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:04,120
Anyway, back to the ceremony!

569
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:08,780
If you don't want to get
kicked out of this shop.

570
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:14,000
Step aside!

571
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:18,860
Tsubaki?

572
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,360
Why are you here?

573
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:28,040
This is the main house.

574
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,660
The servants must leave.

575
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:34,640
Get out of my way!

576
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,040
Does Haseya-san's daughter know about this?

577
00:42:39,620 --> 00:42:43,960
15 years ago,
your husband passed away in this shop.

578
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,800
What did you say?

579
00:42:47,980 --> 00:42:50,700
People say he died of illness.

580
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:52,700
But, what's the truth?

581
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:55,640
And, after knowing that, I still

582
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:00,020
want to be with Tsubaki-san.

583
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:02,450
What? You...

584
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,600
What do you want?

585
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,660
Can you be silent?

586
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:12,060
The cat will run away.

587
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:15,440
Father-in-law.

588
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:19,280
This man is the grand master of Kougetsuan.

589
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,280
You should go to bed.

590
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:23,280
It's not good for your health.

591
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:26,280
Today I'm feeling good.

592
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:31,240
I was so healthy and I made a rakugan.

593
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:36,380
Would you like some?

594
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:38,940
Oh no, I've dropped it.

595
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:40,940
It's hurt.

596
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:45,660
I'm going to make a greeting to the guests.

597
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:50,420
I have told the guests that
the owner is not well.

598
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:53,100
Don't worry. Please go to rest.

599
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:55,360
But they're important guests.

600
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,820
Tsubaki-san, please stop it!

601
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:02,720
Your grandfather doesn't know
what's going on, what he's going to say.

602
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:03,900
I am so sorry.

603
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:08,100
Is everyone here?

604
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:10,800
Master.

605
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,620
That's unusual.

606
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,740
I thought he was sick.

607
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:20,580
Every body.

608
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,700
I am so sorry for your inconvenience.

609
00:44:25,220 --> 00:44:30,020
Today's ceremony has to be cancelled.

610
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:37,940
This rudeness, because of Takatsuki Sojuro.

611
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:41,300
I will pay for it with my entire life.

612
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:46,120
I am very sorry about this.

613
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:07,100
Everything happened today.
It's was because of my selfishness.

614
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,720
I'll take all the responsibility.

615
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,780
I am so sorry.

616
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,180
To be honest,

617
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:20,140
Kougetsuan hasn't been performing well
for several years.

618
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:24,140
Knowing this, Haseya offered to help us.

619
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:29,620
Really?

620
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:31,340
However,

621
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:34,900
"Never judge a book by its cover".

622
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:38,320
I believe that there is no meaning in
compensating temporarily with money.

623
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,700
I have to change Kougetsuan now.

624
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:43,200
Tsubaki-san.

625
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:46,380
your grandfather protected this shop.

626
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:50,100
Based on what...
Take it back!

627
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:52,600
15 years ago,

628
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:57,240
the shop had changed
since it lost its predecessor.

629
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:03,280
Nowadays, Kougetsuan is only a sign of
a long-established business.

630
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:07,020
The taste, the quality...

631
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:11,660
A Japanese sweets shop that satisfies
and recognizes everyone in every way.

632
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:15,100
I want to make it become an ideal place.

633
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:20,920
Certainly!

634
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:23,940
I promise!

635
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:33,300
I thought he's still a child.

636
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:36,620
He has grown up.

637
00:46:40,580 --> 00:46:42,200
He became cheeky.

638
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:45,920
He's only half a man.

639
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:51,060
Well, if you insist,

640
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:55,820
you'll get three months to make a difference!

641
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,900
If you can't, leave with that girl!

642
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:36,460
How do you know about
what happened in 15 years ago?

643
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:39,660
I've heard rumours on the internet.

644
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,720
I thought Master was murdered.

645
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:50,880
I wanted to know a bit about the place
where I was going to marry.

646
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:54,020
Your youkan.

647
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:56,520
It's the same with that.

648
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:00,180
Now, Kogetsuan

649
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:03,260
is wandering around in the dark.

650
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:08,700
But just because you can't see the new moon,

651
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:11,020
it doesn't mean it's gone.

652
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:16,920
It fills up and starts to shine again.

653
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:23,100
I'll make it shine

654
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:25,460
with my hands.

655
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:31,320
In the near future,

656
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:35,980
I'll make this place mine.

657
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:43,100
Is that why you said
you'd marry a woman like me?

658
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:47,700
It was the best way to declare war, wasn't it?

659
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:51,100
The faces of my relatives

660
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:52,860
were a masterpiece.

661
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:55,660
But...

662
00:48:58,080 --> 00:48:59,640
It'd make someone hurt.

663
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:06,300
You...

664
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:09,920
You didn't come here
because you like me, did you?

665
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:15,340
It's the same for me.

666
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:20,140
I'm trying to deceive people
to get into this house.

667
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:23,720
When we've settled where you live,

668
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:26,100
you should move here immediately.

669
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:34,900
But...

670
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:41,700
That's not necessary.

671
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,460
I don't have anything.

672
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:48,960
House.

673
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:51,400
Family.

674
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:53,640
But,

675
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:58,680
I have to find the truth.

676
00:49:58,840 --> 00:49:59,860
From today,

677
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:02,080
please help me.

678
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:27,440
Welcome to our shop!

679
00:50:28,020 --> 00:50:29,700
The moon is beautiful tonight.

680
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:32,000
So, be careful!

681
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:34,440
It's said that
the full moon changes people.

682
00:50:41,060 --> 00:50:42,720
That's the deal.

683
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:46,960
My fiance is not a sweet guy.

684
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:51,840
If I had to name our relationship,

685
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:54,480
It's an accomplice.

686
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:12,640
Ah...

687
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,220
There's a worm in there.

688
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:22,640
We're

689
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:33,980
all insane.

690
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:37,700
(Preview)What she said, I just need to keep them in my heart.

691
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:38,920
(The harsh days begin)
Bad luck!

692
00:51:38,920 --> 00:51:42,050
(The harsh days begin)
I knew this for sure from the beginning,

693
00:51:42,050 --> 00:51:43,100
(The harsh days begin)
that no one would come to my aid.

694
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:44,320
If I get out of here, I won't do it.

695
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:45,980
Don't try to deceive me.

696
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:47,980
What do you want to do to my wife?

697
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:50,270
(Attracted hearts)
Hate! Really hate, but...
