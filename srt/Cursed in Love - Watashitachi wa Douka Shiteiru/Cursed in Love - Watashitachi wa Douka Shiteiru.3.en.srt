1
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:05,140
(Hamabe Minami)

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:08,760
(Hamabe Minami)
15 years ago. It happened at Kougetsuan,

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,480
(Yokohama Ryuusei)
a traditional Japanese sweets shop.

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,480
(Yokohama Ryuusei)
Who? Who did that?

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,040
(Takasugi Mahiro
Kishii Yukino)

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,520
That was Sakura's mother.

7
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,940
With a single word from Tsubaki,
everything was taken away from me.

8
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:21,700
Finally, I could meet you.
Hanaoka Nao-san.

9
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:23,700
(Dear Nao, I didn't do it.)
Here is a letter from your mother.

10
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,700
To find out what really happened that day...

11
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,500
What's your name?

12
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:28,660
Hanaoka Nao.

13
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,840
I have hidden my identity.

14
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,840
(Kougetsuan)
Using the marriage with Tsubaki.

15
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,940
I'm determined to get to Kougetsuan.

16
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:36,800
I'm going to marry this girl.

17
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:37,920
What is waiting for me...

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,860
Pestilence!

19
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:42,020
The landlady harassed me relentlessly and...

20
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,020
Tsubaki shall heir the Kougetsuan.

21
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,780
He's not my real grandson.

22
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:48,260
It's a complicated family situation.

23
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:53,200
There was a girl in this house named Sakura...

24
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,960
But it was the only light in this dark house.

25
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,620
The person I hate most in the world.

26
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:04,040
It's crazy to marry someone like that.

27
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:05,980
But...

28
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,350
There's no way to be back.

29
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,920
Tsubaki...san.

30
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:24,720
If Sakura shows up in front of you,

31
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,220
what would you do?

32
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:32,960
I'll make her disappear

33
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,720
from my world

34
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:39,000
forever.

35
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:41,720
Why?

36
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,480
Sakura's mother

37
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,160
killed my dad.

38
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,660
Did she kill him?

39
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,660
I saw it.

40
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,660
15 years ago, the day my dad died.

41
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:05,880
That day when the tsubaki flowers
in our garden were in full bloom.

42
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,680
It's not even dawn yet...

43
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:14,720
Sakura's mother and my dad were together.

44
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,280
Since that day,

45
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,120
Sakura is no longer a light.

46
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,360
It's like pitch black darkness.

47
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,840
It became only hatred.

48
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:37,720
That story...

49
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:40,000
you don't need to care about it.

50
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:44,240
Did mom go to the master's room that day?

51
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,700
Did they have that kind of relationship?

52
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:50,540
What happened to Master?

53
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:54,660
Nao.

54
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,980
Just don't talk about that any more.

55
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,900
It's not about us.

56
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,200
Uhm.

57
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,500
I don't believe it!

58
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,780
I don't believe it!

59
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,940
That I'm Sakura...

60
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:30,080
I couln't let him know.

61
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,720
So did you check it?

62
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,220
That girl's maiden name is

63
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,040
(Hanaoka[Maiden name: Okura] Nao)

64
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,840
(Maiden name)
"Okura Nao".

65
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,440
(Kougetsuan)

66
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,640
You're early today.

67
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,840
Good morning, Tsubaki-san!

68
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:09,620
Did Tsubaki hold you?

69
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,980
Good morning, Nao-san.

70
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,260
Mom.

71
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,220
Hey Nao-san, can you help me later?

72
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,740
I'd like to take something out of my wardrobe.

73
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,820
I have a lot of luggage...

74
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,960
Of course, Mom.

75
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,040
I would like Nao-san to wear it as a bride.

76
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:36,120
It's a kimono that has been worn through
the generations at Kougetsuan.

77
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,180
But...

78
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:39,180
Is there a needle in it?

79
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,140
Bright red camellia.

80
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:55,900
I'm sorry.

81
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:58,340
I can't wear it.

82
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,540
You have to do it.

83
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,880
It looks great with your dark hair.

84
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:07,660
But Nao-san...

85
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,860
Your mother...

86
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,220
What's about her?

87
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,700
My mother...

88
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,340
She passed away...

89
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,120
By an accident.

90
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,140
When? Where?

91
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,060
It's...

92
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,180
You're so naive.

93
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,780
Your body, your lies...

94
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,380
Stop it.

95
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,780
I've been thinking.

96
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:38,260
This dark hair.

97
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,820
You look familiar.

98
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,920
and that sickly white skin.

99
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,640
Just tell me.

100
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,520
Where did you grow up?

101
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,220
Where were you 15 years ago?

102
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,180
Saku...

103
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,300
Excuse me! I'm sorry to interrupt.

104
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,300
I'm in the middle of something,
you can do it later!

105
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,120
But, um, she's here.

106
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,860
She said she is Nao-san's mother.

107
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,180
What?

108
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,340
Eh? Who?

109
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:36,540
(Hamabe Minami)

110
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,340
(Yokohama Ryusei)

111
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:44,340
=Cursed in Love=

112
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,940
Excuse me.

113
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,880
Nao! Thank goodness!

114
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,560
At last we meet.

115
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,900
I'm so sorry.

116
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,340
Oh, really.

117
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,680
I'm sorry to barge in on you so suddenly.

118
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:21,480
My name is Hanaoka Yuko.

119
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:23,940
Hanaoka Yuko-san.

120
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,340
Um... here, if you like.

121
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:30,100
This is a bud kabuki tea from my hometown Wajima.

122
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,280
Wajima?

123
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,760
Nao was birth and grown there.

124
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:38,000
But I'm not a very good mother.

125
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,000
Nao must be sick of it.

126
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,640
She left home when she was 18
and I haven't heard from her since...

127
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,520
I'm embarrassed to say...

128
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,200
I also heard about
the marriage from my relatives.

129
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,840
I'm sorry, Nao.

130
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:56,020
But I'm glad you're doing well.

131
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,560
Mum, I'm so happy.

132
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:02,420
Nao said her mother

133
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,780
died in an accident.

134
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:04,360
What?

135
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:08,840
Sorry.

136
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:12,700
I left my parents because I was ready to
cut ties with them.

137
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:14,700
That's what I said.

138
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,620
That's why I couldn't answer
your question properly.

139
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,840
15 years ago, you were very particular about this.

140
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,380
What was going on?

141
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,280
Nothing.

142
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:30,040
Mom, please don't worry.

143
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,020
I will make Nao happy.

144
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,420
Always.

145
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,460
Tsubaki-san.

146
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,880
You didn't believe her, did you? Her words.

147
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:51,340
Ah, our wedding...

148
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:53,560
I'm thinking about making it
on the 25th of next month.

149
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,380
What are you talking about?

150
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,980
The 25th. That's day...

151
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,000
What is it?

152
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:04,820
Why do you care so much? To marry her.

153
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,180
That unidentifiable child.

154
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,360
No way.

155
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,700
You don't really love her, do you?

156
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,140
Tsubaki-san!

157
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,080
I don't believe her.

158
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,660
The eyes.

159
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,660
Her eyes...

160
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,320
I won't forgive that.

161
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,100
I must expose her.

162
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,220
I'll get her out of here!

163
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,380
Wait! Wait, please!

164
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,020
Who are you?

165
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,960
My mother, that lie...

166
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,680
Sorry, but I can't give you the answer you want.

167
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,820
I was just asked to do it.

168
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,260
Someone asked you?

169
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:54,940
Yes.

170
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:58,560
I just give a help to
the regular customers of the shop.

171
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,360
Well, I did get a little money.

172
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,300
In fact, you feel like you've been saved right?

173
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,180
Who...? That's...

174
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,060
I don't know anyone who would do that.

175
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,380
I am a fan of your mother's sweets.

176
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:15,580
Wait for it!

177
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,800
Is that a man?

178
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:19,640
Over 30 years old?

179
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,740
Can I meet him? That man?

180
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,820
Please! I'll go anywhere!

181
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,520
I'm sorry for get you in trouble, but please!

182
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:27,380
Please! please!

183
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:28,820
So...

184
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,000
Please!

185
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,000
Nehh!

186
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,080
Please!

187
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,280
Hey!

188
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,740
I have to get paid for my overtime.

189
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,800
The shop opens at six.

190
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,120
Because I can't stop you coming as customers.

191
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:50,100
I'm not sure whether you can meet him or not.

192
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,340
Thank you so much!

193
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:55,980
I'm going today,

194
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,440
I'm going until I can meet him!

195
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,440
(Yuko's Incense shop)

196
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:09,160
It's a long send-off.

197
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:14,480
It's been a long time since we've been together
so we have a lot to talk about.

198
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,620
I'll have to ask my Mom to come.

199
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,780
Our wedding.

200
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,600
Uhm.

201
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,540
Thank goodness, I was able to fake it.

202
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,260
There're some sweets to serve at the ceremony.

203
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,480
Sweets?

204
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,560
The traditional sweets of the shop.

205
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,880
The sweet book is asleep in the back room.

206
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,820
I didn't know there was such a room.

207
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,460
We'll have the ceremony on the 25th of next month.

208
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:48,460
It's unlucky day.

209
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:49,880
Eh?

210
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,680
It's a good day for us, isn't it?

211
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,380
The landlady just told me.

212
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,100
Shee asked me if I believed Nao-san.

213
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:04,680
I knew she didn't know anything about me.

214
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,620
I'm a keeper of untrustworthy people.

215
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:16,260
This man is not so naive.

216
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,060
What's your purpose?

217
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,900
Why did you say you're going to marry me then?

218
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,620
If I marry Tsubaki-san...

219
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,440
I thought I always could make sweets.

220
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,740
I love sweets, I just want to make sweets.

221
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,400
Then...

222
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,420
This place is a pile of riches.

223
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:44,460
What?

224
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,260
Hey!

225
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,100
Tsubaki-san!

226
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,980
What are you doing, Tsubaki-san?

227
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:56,340
Tsubaki-san! Tsubaki-san!

228
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:56,680
(Hayasa Inn)

229
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,560
(Hayasa Inn)
Will you make me a new kimono?

230
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,140
Visiting cloth of you two
would have outgrown.

231
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,740
I'm so happy!

232
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:06,460
Oh, I like Tsujigaoka.

233
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,620
I like Chrysanthemum.

234
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:10,920
And Shiori?

235
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,060
I...

236
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,460
Shiori is for the next arranged marriage.

237
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:18,740
We've just had what happened with Kougetsuan...

238
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,220
You've got nothing to ask,

239
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,840
so you'd better get married.

240
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:24,840
That...

241
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,740
It's okay. Father's right.

242
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,840
(Kougetsuan)

243
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,080
Someone?

244
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,680
Is there anyone out there?

245
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,900
I wonder how long it's been since then.

246
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,220
It's already past six, isn't it?

247
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:50,150
(Cutting dies punch)

248
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,600
So many...

249
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:03,000
Is it for children? It's cute!

250
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,640
A treasure trove, indeed.

251
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,020
The sweet book is like this.

252
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:13,300
It's something that isn't used anymore.

253
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:18,640
This one only is new. "Heisei 17(2005 year)"

254
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,240
15 years ago.

255
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,700
(Sweets book)

256
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,460
This is...

257
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,200
Mom's handwriting.

258
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:32,600
(Wakasa)
Sakura?

259
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,320
(Double cherry blossom)

260
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:35,560
(Slightly pink cherry blossom color)
This is another Sakura.

261
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,960
This is also a sakura sweet.

262
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,960
I don't know anything.

263
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:48,100
I was just making sweets.

264
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,520
Why, even for a moment?

265
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,980
I've ever doubt my mom.

266
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:58,600
If I don't do anything,
I'll be sealed up in this dark storeroom.

267
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,600
It's as if there were no such craftsmen.

268
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:03,860
I saw it.

269
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:09,120
Sakura's mom and my dad were together.

270
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,740
If that's true...

271
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:15,580
How could... how could this happen?

272
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:16,600
And the landlady

273
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
also has motive to kill her husband.

274
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,960
I have to get out of here, no matter what!

275
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,300
It's supper.

276
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,220
Nao.

277
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,320
What are you imitating?

278
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:49,200
I have to go to Yuko-san's shop.

279
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,420
Nao!

280
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,780
Tsubaki, Tsubaki!

281
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,020
What are you crying about?

282
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:40,080
Because...

283
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:51,100
I didn't save you.

284
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,260
I just didn't want to be vulnerable.

285
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:57,120
Tsubaki-san!

286
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,360
What's going on?

287
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,780
That thing...

288
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:06,580
You know it most, don't you?

289
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:12,260
That's not true.

290
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:15,200
It's ok if you're alright.

291
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,420
You're aware of it, too.

292
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,900
In all probability, it was her.

293
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:30,280
I did it to sabotage our marriage.

294
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,800
Aimed at you.

295
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,440
She can't do that.

296
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:38,560
She's going to do
whatever it takes to get rid of her.

297
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,120
If I had just stayed in that room,

298
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,400
none of this would have happened.

299
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:47,520
Wait!

300
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:52,220
Is it possible that
you didn't let me out of that room?

301
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,220
To protect me?

302
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,300
Then say so!

303
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,040
What?

304
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,040
Just say "it's for your own good"

305
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,820
or something like that.

306
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:06,220
I'm sorry it's the only way I can think of.

307
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,240
Well,

308
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,500
I'm not so sure about your escape either.

309
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,020
Anyway,

310
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,360
you stay with me.

311
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,220
Hey, you know what?

312
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,440
Poisonous butterflies are

313
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,160
from the grass they ate as larvae.

314
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:35,860
They store toxins in their bodies
until they become adults.

315
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,460
It was you, wasn't it? You're the one
who did the unnecessary.

316
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:45,640
Tsubaki-san has to take over this shop.

317
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,360
Please don't do anything alone.

318
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,200
Tsubaki-san...

319
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,420
What's going on? Your hand.

320
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,420
I was a bit careless...

321
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,280
It's not a big deal.

322
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:01,620
Tsubaki-san.

323
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:02,460
Yes.

324
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,780
Next Sunday,

325
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,300
I heard that a tea ceremony will be held
at the May Rain Pavilion.

326
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,300
They want to ask Tsubaki-san for some tea sweets.

327
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:13,080
I've just received a request from the Soukunkai.

328
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,240
Soukunkai... Eh... Soukunkai?

329
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,020
Soukunkai for real?

330
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:19,140
What is it? What is the Soukunkai?

331
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,460
One of the best schools of
tea ceremony in Kanazawa.

332
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,100
It's a source of confidence and

333
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,620
pride for the artisans
to be able to produce there.

334
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:29,160
They liked the sweets
that Tsubaki-san made before.

335
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:32,520
They said they'd come to greet afterwards...

336
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,280
Oh, that's great!

337
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,060
It's not that simple.

338
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:38,720
If you serve inferior sweets,
the tea ceremony will be ruined.

339
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,820
Kougetsuan's reputation goes down the drain.

340
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,320
I'm sure our Grand Master has been invited.

341
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,700
If you embarrass yourself, you're in trouble.

342
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,340
Nah, Tsubaki-san.

343
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,840
Do you want me to make it for you?

344
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,260
Thank you for ordering sweets

345
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,400
for this important tea ceremony.

346
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:11,200
To tell you the truth,
this is the first time I'm acting as a host

347
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,640
of all tea ceremonies.

348
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:18,040
This time, my dad, the master,
will be a guest of honour.

349
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,420
Guest of honour?

350
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:22,040
He is the most important guest
at a tea ceremony.

351
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,180
I was very worried because I couldn't fail.

352
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:28,840
But if I can serve Kougetsuan's sweets.

353
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,480
It makes me feel more confident.

354
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:38,200
I want to make my own sweets that say,
"I want to make them"

355
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,500
How can I help you?

356
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:44,800
Sorry.

357
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:47,900
Leave it to us.

358
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,400
I look forward to working with you.

359
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,160
What do you mean?

360
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,800
Just like you did with Shirafujiya?

361
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:55,580
No!

362
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:59,120
I'll help you, please let me do it.

363
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:04,420
You want to work hard
for your beloved future husband?

364
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,760
You're going to rebuild this shop, aren't you?

365
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,760
I want to help too.

366
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,380
All for the sake of
finding out the truth about that day.

367
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,300
I've entrusted you with something
and I want you to do it.

368
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,300
What?

369
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,780
Get dressed first.

370
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:23,920
What?

371
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,240
It's not the sweets that are the star
of the tea party.

372
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,400
It is a prop that complements the tea.

373
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,200
You cannot make sweets for a tea ceremony
without knowing tea.

374
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:40,940
So you have to remember.

375
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:42,500
Remember?

376
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,180
The tea.

377
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,540
I'm going to show you the world as I see it.

378
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,240
When you enter the tea room,

379
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,520
the first thing to do is to bow to the scroll.

380
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:07,380
The hanging scrolls in the sacred alcove.

381
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:10,120
It is the most important tool in the tea room.

382
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,720
What is the meaning of this scroll?

383
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,420
(Undelucision Precepts)

384
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,480
(Undelucision Precepts)
What is it?

385
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:19,200
You've got two rats in the house.

386
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,360
Grand Master.

387
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,660
We'll clear up soon.

388
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:23,040
Well, that's good.

389
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,800
It's been a long time
since I've had a cup of tea made by you.

390
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:32,840
What! Tsubaki-san and Nao-san's
wedding is next month?

391
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:37,360
You'll be busy preparing for
that after the Soukunkai.

392
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,320
Yes.

393
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,580
Huh? But July 25th,

394
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,620
don't the Grand Master hold a tea party

395
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,160
every year for his regular guests?

396
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,380
Ah, the "Evening Tea Ceremony"!

397
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,720
If it coincides with a wedding,
no one will go there.

398
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:53,000
He's doing it!

399
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,200
Tsubaki-san, I think he chose that day on purpose.

400
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,400
What? Why would he do that?

401
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,320
I bet it.

402
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,580
(Undelucision Precepts)
I've never seen anything like it.

403
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:09,880
Supple, careful, beautiful.

404
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,340
Tea Ceremony at Soukunkai

405
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,840
I've been invited as a guest.

406
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,880
I don't think I'll be eating any sweets.

407
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:32,300
Ah! How can you be sure?

408
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,460
Made by one with a false heart...

409
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,220
I don't feel like eating it.

410
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,580
(Undelucision Precepts)

411
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:47,020
You're a liar!

412
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,040
We'll make it, won't we?

413
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:55,760
The kind of sweets
the Grand Master can't resist eating.

414
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,620
I already know what I'm going to make.

415
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,280
What?

416
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:02,200
(It's the "Otoshibumi".)

417
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:06,300
Wait. "Otoshibumi"
is great as a standard thing.

418
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,080
More glamorous than that...

419
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,760
That's what the host wants.

420
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:13,800
You know what that means, don't you?

421
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:15,820
The "Otoshibumi" is

422
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,740
there's an insect called a tiger beetle.

423
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:21,560
A Japanese sweet imitating
the laying of eggs on leaves.

424
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,640
(Otoshibumi)
It is meant to convey the love of a parent.

425
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:28,320
The tea ceremony is held on
the third Sunday in June.

426
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,740
It's Father's Day.

427
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,200
I see.

428
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:33,860
But...

429
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,860
Don't worry.

430
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,700
I'm used to the grand master's sarcasm.

431
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,880
I thought Tsubaki-san was loved by everyone,

432
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:48,540
was living a happy life.

433
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,760
Tsubaki also

434
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,120
lived with a killed heart.

435
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,240
That guy!

436
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,200
Good morning.

437
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,780
Have Nao-san been here?

438
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,780
No, she's not here yet.

439
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,540
I see.

440
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:16,200
Wow, even he can be in such a hurry.

441
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:30,720
Otoshibumi?

442
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,260
I'm sorry, I'll clear up soon.

443
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:39,880
I couldn't sleep because I was thinking about
what kind of "Otoshibumi"

444
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,100
I thought a tearoom might help.

445
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:46,020
Oh, I just thought of that.

446
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,660
With Tsubaki-san's skills,

447
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:50,100
I thought it would be nice to have more lines.

448
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,340
You've been thinking about this all night?

449
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:53,520
Yes.

450
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,620
I don't know if you're getting sleepy.

451
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,900
Let's get going.

452
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,320
Yes!

453
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,420
No! No, it's not.

454
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,320
Why would you put a line there?

455
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,320
Doesn't it look more like a leaf this way?

456
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,540
It looks cluttered.

457
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,640
Does it?

458
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,000
I'll get the coloured powder. Go on.

459
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:27,900
Yes

460
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,560
You've done a lot of work.

461
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:32,920
Jojima-kun.

462
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:36,180
It was hard to make something
hat I was happy with.

463
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:38,100
Tsubaki-san is particular about the lines.

464
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,800
He's a godsend, isn't he?

465
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,620
I can't get the incrustation right either.

466
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,280
Yesterday I was working from morning till night.

467
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,800
In the end I couldn't move my neck.

468
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:50,900
I know! You won't be able to move
an inch from this position.

469
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,860
No, no, it's 1mm.

470
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:58,720
Most of the sweets that
Nao-san makes are light-coloured.

471
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,540
Do you ever use dark colours?

472
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,540
Red, blue.

473
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,540
Oh, that's...

474
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,880
You don't get it, do you?

475
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,640
It's not a light colour, it's a pale colour.

476
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,400
It's difficult to formulate.

477
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,400
It's not a colour that everyone can produce.

478
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,760
It's Nao's color.

479
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:21,040
Hey, Jojima, help me over here. Here.

480
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,020
Yes.

481
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,500
Sorry.

482
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,680
I thought you didn't laugh.

483
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,840
Because I've never seen one.

484
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,200
I don't think so.

485
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,380
Then show it to me.

486
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,340
All right!

487
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,320
Your eyes are not smiling at all.

488
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,860
Hey!

489
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:52,180
You're the one who laughs, Tsubaki-san.

490
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,740
I'm not laughing. Get on with it.

491
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:56,460
You were laughing.

492
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,520
I wasn't laughing.

493
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,900
More subtle.

494
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,900
(Kougetsuan)

495
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,440
Um...

496
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,300
Why don't we take a break?

497
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,980
Jojima-kun.

498
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:19,020
I feel relieved!

499
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:23,440
Oh, by the way, "Otoshibumi"
has many meanings.

500
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,780
One is...

501
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:25,860
Feelings for my parents.

502
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:28,060
Yes. But I...

503
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:30,060
I like the other meaning better.

504
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,680
Hidden thoughts.

505
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:38,380
There's something romantic
about that, isn't there?

506
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:42,220
So don't be too hard on yourself.

507
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,960
Thank you for the tea.

508
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:46,520
That's all right.

509
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,100
"Hidden thoughts".

510
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:55,340
Good.

511
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:13,490
(Kougetsuan)
(On the day of Tea ceremony)

512
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:16,150
(On the day of Tea ceremony)

513
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,740
It's the perfect "Otoshibumi"

514
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,200
Grand Master.

515
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:31,100
Have you gone out yet?

516
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:40,800
"Otoshibumi".

517
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,560
Let me make one for you.

518
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:53,780
What happened with the Grand Master, Tsubaki-san?

519
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:57,500
Even if they weren't blood related.

520
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:00,100
If you've lived with him all your life...

521
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:03,120
The feeling of compassion, kindness.

522
00:30:03,540 --> 00:30:05,820
Isn't that the way things naturally go?

523
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,480
As a child,

524
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,880
I used to learn how to make tea in that room.

525
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,980
Yeah, that makes sense.

526
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,660
Listen, Tsubaki.

527
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,840
One day you're going to take over this shop.

528
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,120
Sometimes my dad said that.

529
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:22,940
Yes.

530
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:26,260
The world of tea is a
once-in-a-lifetime experience.

531
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:29,300
We're in charge of the sweets.

532
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:32,160
Sometimes the grand master
taught us with enthusiasm.

533
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,500
Until that day.

534
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:42,480
I feel like I'm not in the right place at the moment.

535
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,720
Since the day of the incident.

536
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,420
Tsubaki.

537
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,000
What are you hiding?

538
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:56,980
You said.

539
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,880
She was in your father's room.

540
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,820
And you saw it, didn't you?

541
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,160
They were having a row.

542
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:13,140
(Undelucision Precepts)

543
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,080
No?

544
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,380
What then?

545
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:25,740
What were they two doing?

546
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,840
They were kissing.

547
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,900
I was so surprised. I...

548
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,340
But I was curious, so I went to see him
in the morning, and dad...

549
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:46,220
I'm so sorry!

550
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:49,060
But I'm sure she's the one who killed my dad.

551
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,620
You're a liar!

552
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,840
From that day onwards,

553
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:58,120
that man no longer treats me as a grandchild.

554
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:03,360
No matter how much I apologised,
he wouldn't eat my sweets.

555
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:08,320
No matter how many times I make it...
not a single bite.

556
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:10,540
That...

557
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:13,600
But one day, I'm sure.

558
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,960
If I make the perfect sweets,

559
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:19,120
he also recognises me as a child of this family.

560
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:21,840
One day...

561
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,500
Grandfather!

562
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:30,140
I've brought my umbrella.

563
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,000
It's left over from the tea party.

564
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,140
Eat it or throw it away, do with it what you will.

565
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:41,740
Grandfather!

566
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,920
Grandfather, I can't keep my hands to myself!

567
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,220
Grandfather!

568
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,960
That man's most important is
the blood of the Takatsuki family.

569
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:11,920
He doesn't care about anything else,
not even my life.

570
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,760
I swore.

571
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:19,300
I used my whole life to take over this shop.

572
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,860
I will make sure that Kougetsuan will be mine.

573
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,940
Thank you very much for coming today!

574
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:40,840
Excuse me.

575
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:44,360
Excuse me, have you seen
the Grand Master over there?

576
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:47,300
The Grand Master left home early this morning.

577
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,640
Maybe he hasn't been back yet?

578
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:53,300
Well...it's about time.

579
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:56,160
He's really not going to eat that?

580
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,680
I'll go and find him.

(Yuko's Incense shop)

589
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,300
I have to skin the raccoon.

590
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,340
Ah!

591
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:54,740
Oh... it's hurt

Are you OK?

593
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,200

Don't move.

596
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,640
Oops. The tea party is about to start.

597
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:11,920
Then.

598
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:16,920
Wait! I have a question...

599
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:21,240
I've been meaning to see you and talk to you.

600
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:23,760
What? Is this a pick-up?

601
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:24,880
Huh?

602
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:27,780
I'm sorry, I'm not really into younger people.

603
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:28,860
Huh?

604
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,280
But I think I'll take you up on your offer.

605
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,100
Tea party is boring.

606
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,280
Let's talk slowly.

607
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,260
But now...

608
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,120
I guess you have other things to do.

609
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:49,720
No problem.

610
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:54,000
I'm not going to disappear
until the tea party is over.

611
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,520
Grand Master!

612
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,840
Are you OK? I'm calling people.

613
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,480
I was just...

614
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:08,780
I was just looking at the garden.

615
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:11,900
I was just about to go to the tea room.

616
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,220
Please watch your step.

617
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,880
Don't touch me like that!

618
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,740
You think you're a shopkeeper.

619
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:31,060
What do you like about Tsubaki?

620
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:36,440
The name of Kougetsuan must have dazzled him.

621
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:42,000
Or do you feel sorry for Tsubaki,
tied to the house?

622
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,640
You'll be betrayed too.

623
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,360
To that liar.

624
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,740
No, it's not.

625
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:57,540
I thought, "He is an idiot."

626
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:02,320
Tsubaki-san is still making sweets.

627
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,200
Even if he could have let it go at any time.

628
00:37:06,840 --> 00:37:10,200
or it would have been easier for him to stop.

629
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,460
I like that thing.

630
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,520
Like an idiot.

631
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,980
He loves sweets and...

632
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,340
He's a purist.

633
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:38,700
How long are you going to keep everyone waiting?

634
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:41,800
Get off me! I don't need your help.

635
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,500
That's right.

636
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:47,040
I could push you out of here right now.

637
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,180
But

638
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,220
I have an important tea party today.

639
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:09,140
Yam with white bean paste. Delicious.

640
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:11,460
It has a really nice taste.

641
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:14,460
Today's axis is "once in a lifetime".

642
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,940
It's the basis of tea.

643
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:19,080
Yes.

644
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,740
(Once in the lifetime)
We must cherish every moment.

645
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:22,600
(Once in the lifetime)

646
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,480
(Once in the lifetime)
It's always a miracle when you meet someone.

647
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,680
It started successfully.

648
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,740
It's time to prepare some sweets.

649
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:36,840
Just a little...

650
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:40,080
Wait until I get settled.

651
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,080
I've been nervous all day.

652
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:48,200
I've never seen anything like it.

653
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:52,880
I really want this tea party to be a success.

654
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:01,120
No problem.

655
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,040
You're not alone today.

656
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,740
We've got two idiots.

657
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,500
Absolutely fine!

658
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,480
That's right.

659
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,780
Today is Father's Day.

660
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,740
A day of thanksgiving for love!

661
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:30,460
Oh, this is beautiful.

662
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:33,240
The colours are bright and delicate.

663
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,660
It really does look delicious.

664
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:48,540
Then, Kougetsuan-san,
could you please explain about sweets?

665
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:51,460
Yes, please excuse me.

666
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,060
Today is Father's Day,

667
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,400
we have prepared some sweets
called "Otoshibumi",

668
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,960
the gem on the leaf resembles an egg.

669
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:05,960
When the egg returns,

670
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,680
the child is protected by its leaves
from enemies and bad weather...

671
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,940
and can feel the love given by the parents.

672
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:16,680
That is the meaning of the sweets.

673
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,360
For me, it's

674
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,180
Kougetsuan sweets.

675
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,980
The precious love that my dad left me.

676
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,260
As a child, my dad used to teach me.

677
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:49,740
A grain of red beans and a spoonful of sugar
must not be wasted.

678
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:52,440
And then it became sweets.

679
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:57,560
A tea ceremony, a celebration, a souvenir.

680
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,560
It's going to spread around the world.

681
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,820
I liked my dad's ideas too.

682
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,760
I often made mistakes and was scolded...

683
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,180
I was feeling the love.

684
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,600
And yet...

685
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:16,920
The image of my dad that I have had
in my mind since that day...

686
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,360
It's become someone else.

687
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,540
But...

688
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:26,920
Wow, it's so cute! Dad.

689
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,920
I made this mould just for you.

690
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:36,540
I want to believe.

691
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:42,100
I want to carry on my dad's ideas
and leave them behind.

692
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,860
As Tsubaki Takatsuki of Kougetsuan.

693
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,160
If I do that, one day...

694
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:54,280
One day I'll see myself accepting
my dad's love straight away.

695
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,420
I can get it back.

696
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,700
My dad would have wanted

697
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:02,360
and believed that.

698
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:13,400
I can feel the tension in Tsubaki-san's voice.

699
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:17,080
That's because he is expecting it.

700
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:22,360
That the hope he's had for so long will come true.

701
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:29,220
Uhm, delicious! The bean paste is so smooth.

702
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:42,560
Excuse me.

703
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:43,600
Yes.

704
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:53,420
Yes, thank you.

705
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,620
I couldn't get him to eat.

706
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:09,800
The sweets from Kougetsuan were very tasty.

707
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:13,100
I would like to ask you to do
the same for my tea ceremony.

708
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,020
Thank you very much.

709
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,780
He would never eat it.

710
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:29,080
I knew it all along.

711
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:31,120
Let's get this over with.

712
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:34,980
It's been another good tea party.

713
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:36,760
Looks like the tea party is over.

714
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:38,180
Ah!

715
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:41,540
I'm not going to disappear
until the tea party is over.

716
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:47,840
Kougetsuan-san, what happened to you?

717
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:50,500
Um... That man...

718
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:55,120
Who was the man next to our grand master?

719
00:43:55,480 --> 00:43:58,460
Ah, he's a landowner.

720
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:00,360
He owns a lot of land around here.

721
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:02,360
He has a wide range of businesses.

722
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:04,360
How could such a person...

723
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:05,260
Hey!

724
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:07,480
Yes. Excuse me.

725
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:10,340
Ah!

726
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,820
Wait! Let's see.

727
00:44:15,080 --> 00:44:16,200
Let's see...

728
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:17,820
The bearded man!

729
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:23,080
That's a terrible thing to call me.

730
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:25,080
I have a name, that is Takigawa.

731
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:27,620
Takigawa-san...

732
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:31,080
You made the sweets today, didn't you?

733
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:32,640
I knew immediately.

734
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:35,960
Because it tasted just like your mother's.

735
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:38,200
Why...

736
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,140
Didn't I tell you when we first met?

737
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:43,820
I'm a fan of your mother.

738
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:48,440
It's the taste of family.

739
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:53,340
My dad is a man who appreciates
the events of the year.

740
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,180
How are the sweets this time?

741
00:44:56,420 --> 00:44:59,300
It's such a shame to eat them.

742
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:03,460
New Year's Day, Dragon Boat Festival,
Buddhist memorial service.

743
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,880
Once a month, Japanese sweets
are served on the table.

744
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:10,820
It was the only time
the whole busy family came together.

745
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:13,360
I've always thought.

746
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:16,720
The people who make these
powerful Japanese sweets is..

747
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:18,800
I wondered hpw she was like.

748
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:24,780
Takigawa-san, I've made one with white bean paste.

749
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:26,340
Thank you as always.

750
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:27,300
No.

751
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:29,600
Because the best way to enjoy our food is to eat it.

752
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:40,620
My dad died last year.

753
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:43,440
That's when he asked me for the letter.

754
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,600
I don't know how my dad got the letter.

755
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:47,660
I don't know.

756
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:51,060
He wants me to give it to her daughter
who is somewhere else.

757
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:55,060
And he asked me to help him.

758
00:45:58,980 --> 00:45:59,960
I was so happy.

759
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:03,560
I can eat sweets that taste like my family again.

760
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:07,640
I didn't think I'd ever eat it again.

761
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:12,060
As long as you keep making sweets,

762
00:46:12,780 --> 00:46:14,340
I'm watching over you.

763
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,260
Nao.

764
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:24,260
What's wrong with you?

765
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:25,460
No.

766
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:33,540
Takigawa-san...

767
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:38,400
There's only one person who knows who I am.

768
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:42,040
Thank you for your time today.

769
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:48,420
You don't have to pay for the leftover sweets.

770
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:49,820
Sweets?

771
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:52,280
Then it's all gone.

772
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:55,600
Eh? But my grand master...

773
00:46:57,460 --> 00:47:00,100
He asked me to wrap it up for him.

774
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:01,360
Because he wanted to take it home.

775
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:13,000
Did you approve of that?

776
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:45,480
Not yet.

777
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:54,860
Tsubaki-san.

778
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:21,800
You...

779
00:48:23,980 --> 00:48:25,580
What kind of magic can you do?

780
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:30,360
It's been 15 years

781
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:34,140
I never had a bite.

782
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:39,780
A lot of things happen
after decision of getting married.

783
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:44,420
When I said I'd take on the tea party.

784
00:48:45,900 --> 00:48:47,540
I thought, "Screw it..."

785
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,640
Thanks for saying "I do".

786
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:59,200
It's not me, it's the sweets.

787
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:02,120
You heard about it, didn't you?

788
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:06,040
What is the meaning of this hanging scroll?

789
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:09,940
"The precept of non-delusion".

790
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:12,580
"Do not have a false heart."

791
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:16,580
Anyone who lies in front of this scroll

792
00:49:17,840 --> 00:49:19,060
Will go to hell.

793
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,440
Why are you so obsessed?

794
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:26,440
To marry that girl.

795
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:28,980
I don't know anything about that either.

796
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:32,820
No matter how hard I try to hide it.

797
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:35,180
One answer comes to mind.

798
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:37,040
Nao.

799
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:45,140
Maybe I'm

800
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:47,900
drawn to you.

801
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:52,580
I don't want to marry someone
for my own selfishness

802
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:55,080
but as a woman.

803
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:58,840
Tsubaki!

804
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,040
But if you're Sakura,

805
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,840
I have to kill this feeling.

806
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:15,060
Answer me!

807
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:18,820
Are you really Hanaoka Nao?

808
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:21,000
Or

809
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:24,460
Sakura?

810
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,840
It's worked out well.

811
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:39,140
Take this tea to Nao-san, please.

812
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:45,780
But that jar is too much.

813
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:57,320
Because it pisses me off, doesn't it, Tsubaki-san?

814
00:50:58,040 --> 00:50:59,900
Always with a cool face.

815
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:04,060
I just want to see the despair on their faces.

816
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:07,000
What a shame.

817
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:10,700
She's not going to fall for that.

818
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:13,580
I'm the one who will take over this Kougetsuan.

819
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:17,620
But I've got a better idea.

820
00:51:18,460 --> 00:51:20,040
What is it?

821
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:23,920
We'll take it away.

822
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:26,720
Something important.

823
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:32,400
Don't have a false heart.

824
00:51:33,140 --> 00:51:34,960
The one who lies

825
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:38,920
will go to hell.

826
00:51:39,190 --> 00:51:39,590
(Trap?)

827
00:51:39,590 --> 00:51:40,410
(Preview / Trap?)
So delicious!

828
00:51:40,410 --> 00:51:40,610
(Preview / Trap?)

829
00:51:40,610 --> 00:51:41,810
(Trap?)
I like Nao.

830
00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:42,070
(Trap?)

831
00:51:42,070 --> 00:51:42,870
(Trap?)

(Trap?)
Don't come near her!

833
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:43,950
Don't come near her!

834
00:51:43,950 --> 00:51:45,690
I want everything that belongs to you to be mine.

835
00:51:46,050 --> 00:51:48,870
Isn't it unreasonable

00:51:48,870 --> 00:51:50,350
Shameless girl!

837
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:52,910

838
00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:53,870
