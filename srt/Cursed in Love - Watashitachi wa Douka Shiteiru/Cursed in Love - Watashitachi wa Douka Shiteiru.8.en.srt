1
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,000
18 years ago, in a wagashi shop.

2
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,980
The master of Kougetsuan was murdered.

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:10,500
Who? Who did that?

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:11,900
With a word from Tsubaki...

5
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:13,320
That was Sakura's mom.

6
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,320
I've lost everything.

7
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:19,740
To find out the truth,
I decided to hide my identity and

8
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:21,900
sneak back into Kougetsuan.

9
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,980
But no matter how much I try to hate him,

10
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,680
I still love him.

11
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,680
Tsubaki will never take over Kougetsuan.

12
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,100
(DNA paternity test)
Because he's not my real grandson.

13
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:33,760
The Master's real child was...

14
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:35,160
me!

15
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:36,580
No way...

16
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,220
I hated him.
From the bottom of my heart.

17
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,220
I am Sakura.

18
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,200
Did you just say "Sakura"? Why...

19
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,700
I will never love the person
who accused my mom of murder.

20
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,260
To help Tsubaki-kun get the surgery quickly,

21
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,660
you decided to take over Kougetsuan
as soon as possible.

22
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:56,040
On December 31st.

23
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,020
(Kougetsuan)
Could you both make sweets for me?

24
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:02,800
The one who makes the more delicious,
more soul-stirring sweet.

25
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:07,420
The one who makes that...

26
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,080
will be the next successor of Kougetsuan.

27
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,700
(Decemver 11th-Kogetsu An)
Eh? A New Year's Eve showdown?

28
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:21,800
But Kougetsuan has a rule that
only blood relatives can have the shop.

29
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,200
Maybe... the rumours is true, then?

30
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:28,760
Tsubaki-san is not the Grand Master's
real grandson.

31
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,760
He couldn't take over Kougetsuan.

32
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,900
If so, why is Nao-san...?

33
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,120
It's the Grand Master's decision.

34
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:37,220
We just have to respect it.

35
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,780
Tsubaki-san.

36
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:48,940
From our ancestors.

37
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:49,450
(Testament)

38
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:54,820
Acting against the will of a family
that has long tradition.

39
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,620
What I do,

40
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:02,860
(Will)
that you will never be forgiven in the afterlife.

41
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:14,420
I've decided to make Kogetsuan shine again.

42
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:22,620
(We are closed for today-Hanagasumi)
Nao-chan. The shop is still closed, but...

43
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:24,600
I don't have time to run the shop.

44
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:27,680
There are only 20 days left until the battle,

45
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,580
I have to win.

46
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,780
I'm doing this to repay you, Takizawa-san,

47
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,840
And for Tsubaki-kun, right?

48
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:44,840
Shiori-san is pregnant.

49
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,260
Tsubaki-kun's child.

50
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,740
Father-in-law, I have brought you a meal.

51
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,820
We need you to get well soon.

52
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:00,120
Go out.

53
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,260
I am not going to eat anything you serve.

54
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,820
Do you even realize?

55
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,880
Hanoka Nao is

56
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,680
the daughter of the woman who killed Itsuki-san.

57
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:17,200
The one who makes the best sweets
will be the next owner.

58
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:21,520
It's obvious, it's simple.

59
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:24,080
I left everything behind.

60
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,120
I've given my life to this shop!

61
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,460
If Tsubaki doesn't win...

62
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:34,560
I'm not going to change my mind,
no matter what you say.

63
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,160
I see.

64
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,920
A competition to decide the successor?

65
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,340
(Long established Sweets Shop's Dark history
last generation's sudden death was due to Murder?)

66
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,300
If there's anything I can help...

67
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,300
(Murder!?)
You can contact us at any time.

68
00:03:55,540 --> 00:04:00,280
I was so close to achieving my revenge...

69
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,880
That's right.

70
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,660
I have Haseya-san on my side.

71
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,170
Please, I beg you.

72
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,840
Please give me your child.

73
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,840
It's impossible for me right now.

74
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,740
Shiori-san.

75
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,080
Yes.

76
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,980
Do you have the sweets called "Nankin"?

77
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:31,400
Nankin? Nankin...

78
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:34,300
Well, Nankin is...

79
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,340
That would be

80
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,940
(Kabocha Manju)
these are right here.

81
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:39,180
Oh really?

82
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,360
If you eat something with the letter "N" in winter,
you'll have better luck.

83
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,120
It's also called "nankin" only at this time of year.

84
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,000
Is that true?
So interesting!

85
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,110
I'm sorry.

86
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,060
If you're tired, you should ask for a day off.

87
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:01,860
This is critical time for your body,

88
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:08,360
I didn't, you know.

89
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,360
Because I didn't know

90
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,560
that you and Tsubaki-san
already had such a relationship.

91
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,460
"I'll never be yours."

92
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,860
I was out of line at the time.

93
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,220
Sorry.

94
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,660
Please don't apologise.

95
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,110
What? Wait.

96
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:39,680
I'm not a fan of manju...

97
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:44,220
I always worry if something is actually inside...

98
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,280
I get nervous.

99
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:53,440
When I was young,
the manju my dad gave me...

100
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,160
didn't have bean inside.

101
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:00,680
My sisters's manju all had filling.

102
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,160
Only mine was not a good manju.

103
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,520
I'm not...

104
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:16,320
I'm not pregnant.

105
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,540
No, it's not.

106
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:48,320
Nao. Nao.

107
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,600
Nao.

108
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:52,840
Nao.

109
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:54,900
Mom.

110
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,340
Help me, Nao!

111
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:04,910
Mom...

112
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,770
Help!

113
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,450
Mom.

114
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,880
Mom!

115
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,900
Just a dream.

116
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:28,100
That scene again...

117
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,900
That day, 18 years ago...

118
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,080
Who did I see?

119
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,560
Here.

120
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,140
A manju.

121
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,180
Thank you.

122
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,680
There's no red bean paste in it.

123
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,680
It's karukan.

124
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,420
For children, many choose to eat without bean
paste because of worrying about tooth decay.

125
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,940
The ones you ate as a child,

126
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,320
I wonder if it was a really bad manju.

127
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:18,000
You can't see it from the outside.

128
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,020
No matter how much love is inside.

129
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,120
Well, what is it?

130
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,680
Come here with the child once he's born.

131
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,200
I'm always asking for more.

132
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:41,960
I want to be loved, I want to be accepted.

133
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:46,100
But Nao-san...

134
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:49,800
Could you please tell Tsubaki-san
to get his eyes healed?

135
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:53,120
If it comes from Shiori-san, the person
he's going to spend the rest of life with,

136
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,420
I'm sure he'll listen to you.

137
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:00,920
Um....

138
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,040
I have a request.

139
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,340
This is no good either.

140
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:11,020
Sweeter? More flavour?

141
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,740
The fabric...

142
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:16,570
Nao-chan!

143
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,340
Sorry, I'm fine.

144
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,600
Let's rest some bit, Nao-chan.

145
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:24,280
I just don't know.

146
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:27,980
What can I make to reach
the heart of the Grand Master?

147
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,820
Because I don't have any memories.

148
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:36,510
It's not like Tsubaki,
who has been with him his whole life.

149
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:40,110
What should I do...?

150
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,220
Huh... What should I do?

151
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,940
Nao-chan, sit down.

152
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,560
Slowly.

153
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:53,200
Nao-chan, close your eyes.

154
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:55,800
Just close.

155
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,360
Let's catch our breath.

156
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,720
Tangerine fragrance.

157
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,460
I just got this from a client.

158
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,040
Smells good, doesn't it?

159
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,840
I'm sorry for worrying you.

160
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:30,560
I'm getting more and more scared...

161
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,360
To make sweets.

162
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,920
I've never done anything like this before...

163
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:42,020
Because sweets have always helped me.

164
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,920
Well, that's a relief.

165
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:53,980
No, Nao-chan was a normal human being.

166
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:56,900
I'm not going to let anything stop me.

167
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:01,040
You can be as weak as you want.

168
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:06,040
Whether I take over Kougetsuan
or stay here at Hanagasumi.

169
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,720
Even if you stop making sweets, you are still you.

170
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,720
Nothing is going to change.

171
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,300
So...

172
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,460
You can make anything you want with confidence.

173
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,000
You like sweets that I like.

174
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,800
I like...

175
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:29,120
Neh, Nao-chan.

176
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:34,100
When your dreams come true
and everything is over...

177
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,480
I want you to marry me.

178
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,080
Sorry.

179
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:02,520
Huh? Tsubaki-kun?

180
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,980
I've been thinking a lot lately.

181
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,540
One day you'll get what you came for.

182
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:13,460
If Nao-chan disappears from next to me...

183
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,320
I shudder to think of it.

184
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,900
I don't want to give to anyone.

185
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:36,100
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.

186
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:39,620
No, now is not the time.

187
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,460
Just concentrate on winning the game.

188
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:47,720
Yes.

189
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,800
Sorry.

190
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:57,300
Jojima-kun.

191
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,000
Surprised! How long has it been?

192
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,980
It's been three years.

193
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,500
I see.

194
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,500
You already know, don't you?

195
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,860
It means I'm not Nao's real mom.

196
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,260
Nao asked me to do it.

197
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,420
A lie to take Kougetsuan from me.

198
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:27,160
What are you talking about...
You are wrong.

199
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,160
Nao's true identity was exposed.

200
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,140
She disappeared in the fire.

201
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,140
No.

202
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,080
You

203
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,540
don't know anything, do you?

204
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:40,080
She

205
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:45,320
was pregnant, your child.

206
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,060
A child?

207
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,460
There's

208
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,580
nothing between Tsubaki-san and I.

209
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:07,580
Eh?

210
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:10,320
When the fire broke out

211
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,160
Tsubaki-san tried to keep his promise to Nao-chan

212
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,700
At that time...

213
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,560
Tsubaki-san!

214
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,840
Nao.

215
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:34,980
Back

216
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,080
to Nao's place.

217
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:42,080
I can't believe.

218
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:46,080
But I thought Tsubaki-san
had gone to get that tool...

219
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,500
No, it's not.

220
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,960
Are you okay?

221
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:50,900
Hey! You, go to the back!

222
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:51,740
Yes.

223
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:08,120
The one which designated
as a cultural asset by the city.

224
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,680
I heard that your sweets
moulds and tools were safe.

225
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,180
Here it is!

226
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,360
Our young master protected them.

227
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,040
Risking his life.

228
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,260
Neh, landlady?

229
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,220
Yes.

230
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:22,380
(2 days after the fire)
As expected from the future successor.

231
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,640
Landlady,

232
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,240
that toolbox...

233
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,060
It was

234
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,060
Tsubaki-san saved them.

235
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,100
For those who are in charge,

236
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:36,200
we need anecdotes like that.

237
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,620
It's for Tsubaki-san.

238
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,980
All for Tsubaki-san.

239
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,560
Tsubaki-san.

240
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:52,200
Tsubaki-san lost his memory in the fire.

241
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:55,280
I've been obsessed with
that tool for a long time.

242
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:58,320
He never questioned whether
he saved the tools or not.

243
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:03,700
After the fire,

244
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,600
I heard the two of you broke up.

245
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,760
I was thinking

246
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:15,240
I thought there might be a chance for me.

247
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,260
If so,

248
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,720
I was going to hide what I know.

249
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:28,460
I should have told you sooner.

250
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,300
I'm really sorry.

251
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,040
If that time...

252
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,880
even if I know the truth.

253
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:47,320
It was a fate that could not be changed.

254
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:52,900
Tsubaki and I hurt each other nonstop

255
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,360
ever since we met.

256
00:16:58,660 --> 00:16:59,560
So...

257
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,980
It's okay.

258
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,660
Nao-san's situation,

259
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:13,700
I've done my search and I know a bit about it.

260
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,100
If you lose the competition,

261
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,620
what are you going to do, Nao-san?

262
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,800
For the rest of my life, I'll be at Kougetsuan...

263
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:26,300
Are you going to live with
a grudge against Tsubaki-san?

264
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,460
A child…

265
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,600
But after the fire...

266
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:04,260
She really looked like she was in a lot of pain.

267
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,260
She kept blaming herself.

268
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,240
Why...

269
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:13,140
Why didn't she say anything?

270
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,400
Sorry.

271
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:19,280
She told me to never tell you about it.

272
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,340
After all,

273
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:28,160
we were nothing but just a fake couple.

274
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,580
Keeping the baby

275
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:35,640
isn't a light decision to make, you know.

276
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:52,420
Here.

277
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,500
You've done well.

278
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,820
I'm impressed.

279
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,560
Thank you.

280
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,520
It's complicated, those two.

281
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:27,260
Yes.

282
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,040
The landlady.

283
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,380
Can I have a word with you?

284
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:42,340
Oh, Shiori-san, perfect timing.

285
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:46,960
I ordered your wedding kimono
from Shirafuji-ya.

286
00:19:47,140 --> 00:19:50,800
Let's have the ceremony as soon as possible.

287
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,540
About that...

288
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,100
I...

289
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,400
I still can't marry Tsubaki-san.

290
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,080
The truth is...

291
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:08,040
Because you're not pregnant?

292
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:12,100
Did you know that? Sorry!

293
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,640
I will talk to my father about this.

294
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:18,140
Shiori-san. It's okay. It's not like that.

295
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,880
You can always do something about it later.

296
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,460
If not Tsubaki, then someone else.

297
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,220
It doesn't matter who you're with,

298
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:30,220
Just get pregnant.

299
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,260
I told you.

300
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:35,980
Things change when you have children.

301
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,720
You can be happy!

302
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,460
I don't want to!

303
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,460
Why not?

304
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:46,540
Please, Shiori-san! Neh, please...

305
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,860
Shiori-san, clean up the shop, please.

306
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,360
Wait...

307
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,680
Would you stop

308
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,160
dragging others into this?

309
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,440
Can you make it?

310
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,960
Sweets to impress your grandfather.

311
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:06,600
What if he chooses that little girl's sweets?

312
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,680
I refuse to accept it.

313
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,420
That woman took Itsuki-san away from me.

314
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,060
Now she's taken Kougetsuan away too.

315
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:16,520
Nao doesn't think her mom did it.

316
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,520
It was the woman who killed her.

317
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:22,100
The police said
there were fingerprints on the knife.

318
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,740
I won't give it.

319
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:32,180
Not to that girl!

320
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,200
Let's go cancel this competition.

321
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:37,400
No...

322
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:41,680
Tsubaki?

323
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,640
Don't do anything.

324
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,620
Not to Shiori-san and not to Nao-san.

325
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:51,080
If you do anything in the slightest,
I'm out of this game.

326
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:57,360
I'm going to win this game.

327
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,440
(December 29th)

328
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,140
(December 29th)
It's the 29th already.

329
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,240
New Year's Eve is in 2 days.

330
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,280
Yes.

331
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,360
Now that you know you misunderstood Tsubaki-kun,

332
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:20,160
are you having second thoughts?

333
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,820
Of course not.

334
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:28,240
You're still a terrible liar, Nao-chan.

335
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,220
The day after tomorrow's game
will decide who will take over Kougetsuan.

336
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,760
But is that really how it ends?

337
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:38,180
Between Nao-chan and Tsubaki-kun.

338
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:43,180
Once the successor is chosen,

339
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:46,180
You may never see him again, you know?

340
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,500
I thought

341
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,740
After Nao-san left Kogetsuan.

342
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,940
you will start to enjoy making sweets.

343
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,100
What are you talking about?

344
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:10,140
How long do you think you can keep up the pretence?

345
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,900
This last three years.

346
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:15,020
you've never once stopped loving her!

347
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,920
Is this what you really want?

348
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:34,920
Maybe I'm attracted to you.

349
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,660
Nao.

350
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:41,300
I like you.

351
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:50,460
I just wanted to see Tsubaki.

352
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:54,480
Thank you.

353
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,940
I'll wait for you.

354
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:00,940
I'll wait you here, Tsubaki!

355
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:10,580
I'm coming back... to Nao's place.

356
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,900
It look like it's going to snow.

357
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:52,880
Uhm.

358
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:07,860
When I was little,

359
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,960
I was weak and withdrawn.

360
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:15,200
Tsubaki was so cheerful.

361
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:19,800
When we're together, it's warm and dreamy...

362
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,280
Those days,

363
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:25,940
I really liked Tsubaki.

364
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,660
But at the same time,

365
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:31,780
there's a scene that always comes to mind.

366
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,180
That was Sakura's mom.

367
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:38,580
That scene

368
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:42,040
makes me so inexplicably angry.

369
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:47,560
I love you... but I can't forgive you.

370
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,640
Win or lose...

371
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:03,480
The day after tomorrow will be our last.

372
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,100
Make it last.

373
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,720
I'll never see Tsubaki again.

374
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,120
I understand.

375
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,820
Don't cry.

376
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:00,520
Or I won't be able to leave.

377
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,080
Only at the end...

378
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:28,380
Just for now, I want to be with Tsubaki.

379
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,620
Tomorrow we'll celebrate the event.

380
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,900
It'll be the day

381
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,620
our fate is decided.

382
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,620
(December 31st)

383
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:18,600
Okay, that's all.

384
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:21,960
It's always nerve-wracking to put up the lanterns.

385
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:25,200
It's God's pathway.

386
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:30,380
Who will Tsubaki-san and Nao-san smile at?

387
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:33,800
If Tsubaki-san loses,

388
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:36,800
will he leave this place?

389
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,760
He won't lose.

390
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:44,380
Tsubaki-san knows everything about this shop.

391
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:47,160
Nao-san can't beat that.

392
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:51,160
Come on, let's go.

393
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,180
Surprising.

394
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:59,680
I can't believe you made it to today
without any interference.

395
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:05,180
I'm gonna win this fight.

396
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,480
Because I believe that my son will win.

397
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,120
Yes, please.

398
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:29,480
Yes, I'm prepared.

399
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,940
Please proceed as soon as possible.

400
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:51,080
Excuse me.

401
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:06,840
Let's see what you two have brought.

402
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,000
Yes.

403
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,360
Yes.

404
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:12,360
First one is Sakura.

405
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:17,480
Let's start with your sweets.

406
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,220
Here you are.

407
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,260
"Yuzu sweets"

408
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,280
This is....

409
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:44,980
Did you put the whole peel of the yuzu in?

410
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:49,120
I used Hime Yuzu.

411
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,180
I Hollowed out the inside.

412
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:54,680
Extremely thin skin.

413
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:58,120
Soaked in honey, filled with red bean paste.

414
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,980
Incrusting it.

415
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,460
(Winter Warm)

416
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:04,340
The result is a beautiful looking kneaded cut.

417
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,420
Hmmm!

418
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:18,680
The texture of the crust melts in your mouth.

419
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:24,100
A pleasant fragrance that lasts forever.

420
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:28,560
Does the confinement of
the bowl leave a lingering aroma?

421
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,700
A warm sweet.

422
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:36,240
Like you want to be wrapped up forever.

423
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:40,340
Warm sweets.

424
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:43,080
Mom,

425
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:47,600
why does the smell of the sweet disappear so fast?

426
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:51,720
Because it's inside your stomach.

427
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:56,580
Let's make it one day.

428
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,200
Sweets that don't make you feel lonely like that,

429
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,480
with Mom.

430
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,820
Yes, promise!

431
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:11,680
I was able to make it properly.

432
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:14,840
Sweets that I think I like.

433
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:20,420
Next, let's have yours.

434
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,420
Yes.

435
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,660
It's "Tsubaki Mochi".

436
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,600
(Tsubaki Mochi)

437
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:39,260
It appears in The Tale of Genji.

438
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,680
It's said to be the origin of Japanese sweets.

439
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:46,660
A simple camellia leaf sandwiching Domyoji.

440
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:52,080
To think that Tsubaki would come
and make such a simple pastry.

441
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:02,720
This taste...

442
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:06,840
How do you know what this tastes like?

443
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,340
The taste I taught Itsuki.

444
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:17,040
It was the first sweet I learnt from my father.

445
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,620
Listen, Tsubaki?

446
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:25,800
Our Domyoji is steamed with
a little bit of the heart left on.

447
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,520
Your body will know
what it feels like to be steamed.

448
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:29,340
Yes.

449
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:34,140
You must have been taught
when you were really young.

450
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,500
How did you manage to recreate it exactly.

451
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:41,620
I will never forget.
The taste means a lot to me.

452
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,840
Japanese sweets tell the story...

453
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,520
It's not just about taste.

454
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:00,180
The scene when it is in your mouth.

455
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:03,040
A feeling.

456
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:09,420
A tender memory that was certainly there.

457
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:15,980
I'm sure it's the same with you, Grandfather.

458
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:23,620
Tsubaki, come here.

459
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:24,980
Yes!

460
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,300
That's it.

461
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:33,120
It's been handed down from
generation to generation.

462
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:59,180
They were both fantastic sweets.

463
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,520
One more for me.

464
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,220
Let me think it over again.

465
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:12,400
Tsubaki, you stay in the left room.

466
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:16,180
Sakura, you stay in the right room.

467
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:20,940
I will open the door belonging to my final choice.

468
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:50,480
You can't just sit there and listen to them.

469
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,300
You won't hear a thing.

470
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:01,140
I'll give you a chance.

471
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:07,980
Choose the sweet which you think is
the most suitable for successor.

472
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,680
What?

473
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:14,540
I'm respecting your position as a landlady.

474
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,180
It's easy.

475
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:52,100
I choose this one.

476
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:06,280
If I win, my future is ahead of me.

477
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:13,260
If I lose, I will have to give up

478
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,540
the important things I've believed in until now.

479
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:26,820
I'll leave Kougetsuan to you.

480
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:44,320
I give it to you.

481
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:05,740
Me? I will take over Kougetsuan...

482
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,020
Why?

483
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:10,000
I chose the yuzu confectionery.

484
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,680
Beautiful and elaborate looking pastries.

485
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:15,680
Exactly what the Tsubaki made!

486
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:19,260
Tsubaki made "Tsubaki Mochi".

487
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:23,540
The first sweet Itsuki taught him to make.

488
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,660
Tsubaki.

489
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:44,740
Tsubaki.

490
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:49,140
You promised me, didn't you?
You said you'll win.

491
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:51,080
Ne, Tsubaki!

492
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:55,700
What do you think I gave birth to you for?

493
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:56,740
Stop it!

494
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:58,680
I shouldn't have believed it!

495
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:01,080
There were so many ways to do it!

496
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,060
I won't stop...

497
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,020
Grand Master!

498
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:07,880
Call an ambulance...

499
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,140
Don't call.

500
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,560
No more... hospitals.

501
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,000
Grandfather.

502
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,520
You must have been pushing yourself very hard.

503
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:37,420
Sensei, is he...?

504
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:41,240
He wants to talk to you.

505
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,240
Tsubaki-san, alone.

506
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:54,400
Tsubaki...

507
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:01,170
Your "Tsubaki mochi",

508
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:05,340
it was really good.

509
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:08,680
But...

510
00:40:10,050 --> 00:40:14,080
I couldn't pick yours.

511
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:17,910
Because...

512
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:24,220
That was a sweet made only for me.

513
00:40:29,050 --> 00:40:32,520
I've been always...

514
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:40,910
wanted you to accept me.

515
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,340
I'm sorry... really.

516
00:40:51,370 --> 00:40:55,710
Neither I or Itsuki had the choice,

517
00:40:57,310 --> 00:41:03,880
but from now, you have all the freedom
to make any sweets you want.

518
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,200
You should

519
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:13,420
Make sweets that are unique to you.

520
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,200
Without any restraints.

521
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:23,420
As you think...

522
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,710
Grandfather.

523
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:37,340
Grandfather... Grandfather!

524
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:39,600
Please step back.

525
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:45,370
Two times...

526
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:49,570
You've only eaten two of my sweets.

527
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:52,450
I'm going to make more for you.

528
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:55,000
To make up for all the time we lost.

529
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:00,880
I'm sorry.

530
00:42:15,340 --> 00:42:17,450
Grandfather...

531
00:42:38,370 --> 00:42:40,370
(Dear valued customer,
we are close for 5 days - Manager)

532
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:45,970
It's finally time for
a new generation at Kougetsuan.

533
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,940
Tsubaki-san will take over, won't he?

534
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:51,650
I heard that's not true.

535
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:56,450
He said he couldn't take over Kougetsuan
because he wasn't his own grandson.

536
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:59,340
Then why don't you come back to my house too?

537
00:42:59,740 --> 00:43:00,910
That's right,

538
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:02,340
Father.

539
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:04,370
Do what you want.

540
00:43:05,820 --> 00:43:06,880
Father...

541
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,650
Now my family is...

542
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:20,400
Really, there's no one left.

543
00:43:23,910 --> 00:43:24,880
Tsubaki-san...

544
00:43:35,710 --> 00:43:37,440
What are you wearing?

545
00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:39,510
What happened to your kimono?

546
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,940
Thank you very much for your help.

547
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:46,820
What?

548
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:07,510
It's the opposite of what it was 18 years ago.

549
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,540
At last I have something of my own.

550
00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:23,650
Good for you.

551
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:35,770
I just have one request.

552
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,220
Promise me,

553
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:44,110
you'll never destroy the Kougetsuan.

554
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:01,570
No matter what happens in the future.

555
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:04,120
We will protect you.

556
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:13,240
When all is said and done,

557
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,600
I want you to marry me.

558
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:23,000
Takigawa-san, I...

559
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,250
You still have things to do, don't you?

560
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:29,740
"Someday I will make my own sweets..."

561
00:45:29,940 --> 00:45:31,880
"I wish I could serve it at Kougetsuan".

562
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:35,160
Yes.

563
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:55,800
(Sakura no Yokan)
"Sakura no Yokan" by Mom.

564
00:45:56,710 --> 00:45:58,110
In order to make it...

565
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,360
I can't...

566
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:24,000
I still can't...

567
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:28,740
Are you okay? Nao-san.

568
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:30,540
The landlady.

569
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:34,310
Don't look so scared.

570
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:38,220
We need to join forces from now

571
00:46:38,650 --> 00:46:42,170
to protect the shop together.

572
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:44,450
Please let me go.

573
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:49,370
Please admit that you killed the master.

574
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:52,400
and that you framed my innocent mom.

575
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:56,080
Please tell the whole truth
and atone for your crimes.

576
00:46:57,420 --> 00:46:59,850
Oh no, Nao-san.

577
00:47:01,570 --> 00:47:03,820
The one who killed Itsuki-san...

578
00:47:05,050 --> 00:47:07,600
is your mom.

579
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:14,340
Oh, poor Tsubaki.

580
00:47:14,970 --> 00:47:17,000
Because of you,

581
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:19,000
You've completely broke him.

582
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:27,770
I will not

583
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:31,220
let you have this shop!

584
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:43,600
As long as she is here...

585
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:47,050
My mom will forever be a murderer.

586
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:55,710
I see, so Tsubaki-kun left the shop...

587
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:56,710
Yes.

588
00:47:57,080 --> 00:48:01,370
I'm sure they're still in love with each other...

589
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:03,940
Welcome...

590
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:06,620
Oh, Mizoguchi-sensei,

591
00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:09,760
I didn't think you''ll come back.

592
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,820
The head of Kougetsuan has been replaced.

593
00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:16,920
I don't have to worry about that landlady anymore.

594
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:19,480
It's like being a stranger.

595
00:48:20,820 --> 00:48:23,200
You seem to be very close to our landlady...

596
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:27,250
Tsubaki's real father?

597
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,140
It's you, isn't it?

598
00:48:50,250 --> 00:48:52,480
Tsubaki-kun's father is...

599
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,400
Not me.

600
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:03,910
But I know who

601
00:49:04,820 --> 00:49:06,620
his real father is.

602
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:18,400
Why did you call me all the way out here,

603
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:20,760
Yamaguchi-san.

604
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:25,000
Landlady!

605
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,570
The smell of paraffin?

606
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:39,940
Three years ago,

607
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:42,570
this should have been burned with them.

608
00:49:44,570 --> 00:49:47,880
If Tsubaki can't use it, there's no point.

609
00:49:49,910 --> 00:49:53,650
If it's going to be used by that wretched girl,

610
00:49:55,770 --> 00:49:57,620
I'll rather burn it all.

611
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:06,600
What is going on?

612
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:10,650
You and I are accomplices, aren't we?

613
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:20,940
Accomplice? No kidding.

614
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:24,080
You are the person I hate most in the world.

615
00:50:27,110 --> 00:50:29,370
Kougetsuan belongs to Nao-chan.

616
00:50:29,740 --> 00:50:31,970
If you still intend to stay...

617
00:50:37,170 --> 00:50:38,220
Nao-chan.

618
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:40,680
18 years ago,

619
00:50:41,170 --> 00:50:44,140
his father and the landlady conspired together.

620
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:48,480
He murdered the head of
the Kougetsuan, Takatsuki Itsuki.

621
00:50:48,970 --> 00:50:50,940
At the time, there were a lot of rumours about it.

622
00:50:51,310 --> 00:50:53,580
Ne, Yuko-san,

623
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:04,160
He's a famous landlord around here,

624
00:51:05,650 --> 00:51:06,680
named Takigawa.

625
00:51:07,970 --> 00:51:11,420
Takigawa... The same Takigawa at Hanagasumi?

626
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:17,050
His father, a man called Takigawa Hideyuki.

627
00:51:19,310 --> 00:51:21,940
Don't be so mean.

628
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:26,800
Your father was very kind to me.

629
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:30,940
Yes, if not Kougetsuan.

630
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:35,200
I think I'll let Tsubaki take over
the Takigawa family.

631
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:35,940
What are you talking?

632
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:37,200
Because isn't it true?

633
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:41,100
Tsubaki is blood-related to the Takigawa family.

634
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:45,510
Don't you think you deserve better
than an unskilled brother?

635
00:51:46,420 --> 00:51:49,000
Tsubaki and Takigawa-san are brothers?

636
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:51,520
Mmm!

637
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:57,680
Landlady!

638
00:51:59,970 --> 00:52:01,600
It was just right.

639
00:52:02,450 --> 00:52:05,050
I'll show you too, Nao-san.

640
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:07,280
It must be beautiful,

641
00:52:09,110 --> 00:52:12,080
a beautiful red flame.

642
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:13,620
Please don't...

643
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,460
Oh, no!

644
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:22,800
Put it off.

645
00:52:23,310 --> 00:52:28,220
Just let it all burn hahahaha....

646
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:29,480
I promised...

647
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:33,600
I promised Tsubaki I'd protect Kougetsuan!

648
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:34,580
Please no!

649
00:52:38,570 --> 00:52:40,170
Stop burning!

650
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:53,400
You are so reckless.

651
00:52:54,510 --> 00:52:55,400
Tsubaki.

652
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:07,840
Thank goodness.

653
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:11,260
Good.

654
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:15,450
Why?

655
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:21,650
Is it true? That I'm his younger brother?

656
00:53:24,820 --> 00:53:27,260
Didn't you love father?

657
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:30,940
I did love him.

658
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:33,900
till I want to kill him.

659
00:53:35,970 --> 00:53:39,510
I'm going to do my best for Itsuki-san and this shop.

660
00:53:39,850 --> 00:53:42,000
I had made a vow in my heart.

661
00:53:43,170 --> 00:53:44,380
But...

662
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:48,250
I found out Itsuki

663
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:54,200
was already in love with someone else.

664
00:53:55,250 --> 00:53:56,820
At such times...

665
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:00,820
(Divorce petition)

666
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:04,000
I wanted to break up.

667
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:10,970
I had a hunch that he was having a baby
with the other woman.

668
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:16,710
This time they're going to be together for real.

669
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:19,050
A child...

670
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:22,510
What's wrong? Landlady.

671
00:54:25,850 --> 00:54:29,910
If only I had a child too.

672
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:35,420
So my father and...

673
00:54:36,910 --> 00:54:38,770
I think I'm pregnant.

674
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:41,740
Right? Itsuki-san.

675
00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:43,980
Is that right?

676
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:46,970
What are you doing?

677
00:54:47,110 --> 00:54:50,200
I don't mind telling people everything.

678
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:53,250
But when the world finds out...

679
00:54:53,250 --> 00:54:57,220
The reputation of Kougetsuan will be ruined.

680
00:54:58,450 --> 00:55:00,650
Tsubaki, who is not related to me by blood...

681
00:55:00,650 --> 00:55:03,220
If you become the head of the Kougetsuan,

682
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:06,510
it is the best revenge.

683
00:55:08,710 --> 00:55:12,320
And instead, that woman...

684
00:55:13,910 --> 00:55:16,280
Wow, what a cute confectionery!

685
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:19,820
She rolled up to the shop.

686
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,600
I knew I shouldn't have come here.

687
00:55:23,650 --> 00:55:24,570
I'm leaving now,

688
00:55:24,570 --> 00:55:26,400
Are you doing things on your own again?

689
00:55:31,370 --> 00:55:36,570
When I heard you were pregnant, I was so happy.

690
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,140
And then suddenly you disappear,
and I can't tell you how worried I was.

691
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:51,200
I've finally tracked you down.

692
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:53,820
No matter what the world says about us.

693
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:58,000
I will protect you, and our child.

694
00:56:06,570 --> 00:56:10,400
Shw was like a permanent fixture in his heart.

695
00:56:11,110 --> 00:56:12,850
A Parasite!

696
00:56:14,770 --> 00:56:17,910
Is that why you put the blame on her?

697
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:22,540
I remembered that day, 18 years ago.

698
00:56:23,420 --> 00:56:25,970
That day, from the kitchen of the shop,

699
00:56:25,970 --> 00:56:28,850
someone had taken Nao's mom's knife.

700
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:34,200
Landlady, that was you.

701
00:56:35,770 --> 00:56:37,970
What... why?

702
00:56:37,970 --> 00:56:39,620
You killed him!

703
00:56:43,800 --> 00:56:45,650
I came to Kougetsuan

704
00:56:46,080 --> 00:56:48,970
18 years ago, right afer that incident.

705
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,310
The workforce has been completely renewed...

706
00:56:51,850 --> 00:56:57,710
Actually, I heard about it from
my predecessor when I took over.

707
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:02,820
Early on the morning of the day of the murder,
the landlady left the kitchen.

708
00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:06,020
He said he saw you take out
a certain craftsman's knife.

709
00:57:07,450 --> 00:57:08,940
A craftsman...?

710
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:13,140
A woman named Okura Yuriko.

711
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:18,970
But all the old staff members

712
00:57:19,850 --> 00:57:21,110
were given new jobs

713
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:23,740
and large sum of money.

714
00:57:24,710 --> 00:57:26,880
So no one said anything.

715
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:32,740
I could not accuse
the landlady without any proof.

716
00:57:33,710 --> 00:57:35,280
So I stayed quiet.

717
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:42,480
I don't think Nao's mom is the murder.

718
00:57:42,770 --> 00:57:44,880
Even if the successor of Kougetsuan
has been decided,

719
00:57:45,310 --> 00:57:47,420
If the truth about the case remains unclear.

720
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:48,620
I don't think

721
00:57:49,110 --> 00:57:50,920
either of you can move forward.

722
00:57:54,940 --> 00:57:56,400
The night before the incident...

723
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,970
I saw them in this room.

724
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:04,620
I was shocked to find out that
his real child is Sakura...

725
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:09,800
What's the matter? Tsubaki-san?

726
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:11,800
At this hour...

727
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:14,510
Can't sleep?

728
00:58:16,570 --> 00:58:18,740
I think I have no choice

729
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:23,740
Come sleep in my room tonight.

730
00:58:26,450 --> 00:58:30,600
That's right. You proved that I didn't leave
my room at all that night.

731
00:58:30,850 --> 00:58:33,880
Didn't you prove it to me?

732
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:36,620
Oh... but early the next morning...

733
00:58:37,110 --> 00:58:39,000
I'll go and wake your father.

734
00:58:39,170 --> 00:58:39,680
Yes.

735
00:58:42,910 --> 00:58:47,400
If Nao's mom is still in father's room...

736
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:49,280
So I rushed after her.

737
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:56,000
Father!

738
00:58:57,540 --> 00:59:01,770
Father!

739
00:59:21,910 --> 00:59:23,710
I saw you run into the garden.

740
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,050
After that,

741
00:59:29,050 --> 00:59:31,250
you took Nao's mom's knife out of the kitchen.

742
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:33,900
and came back to the room.

743
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:38,480
At that time....

744
00:59:42,050 --> 00:59:44,200
I'm sure I saw you too.

745
00:59:45,110 --> 00:59:46,220
Tsubaki-san?

746
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:47,620
Tsubaki.

747
00:59:47,910 --> 00:59:48,970
Tsubaki-san?

748
00:59:57,880 --> 00:59:58,800
Master!

749
01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:01,340
Master!

750
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:04,320
How could... how could this happen...

751
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:05,770
Mom...

752
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:15,710
I saw her yesterday...

753
01:00:17,740 --> 01:00:19,540
In father's room...

754
01:00:24,450 --> 01:00:26,340
Are you sure? Tsubaki-san.

755
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:31,710
Did you really see someone in your father's room?

756
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:34,880
And they were arguing, weren't they?

757
01:00:35,310 --> 01:00:37,940
You saw it, didn't you? Didn't you?

758
01:00:39,000 --> 01:00:41,050
Yes.

759
01:00:41,160 --> 01:00:42,850
Say it right!

760
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:47,280
Who was it? Hey, who was it?

761
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:02,860
Sakura's mom.

762
01:01:09,170 --> 01:01:11,600
I know you were the murderer.

763
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:12,450
It wasn't me!

764
01:01:12,450 --> 01:01:14,770
I lost everything that day.

765
01:01:15,570 --> 01:01:19,910
Tell me everything
that really happened 18 years ago.

766
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:29,370
I just switched out the murder weapon.

767
01:01:30,080 --> 01:01:31,770
If it was me,

768
01:01:32,310 --> 01:01:35,000
I'd used her knife from the start.

769
01:01:35,310 --> 01:01:40,570
When I came to this room,
Itsuki-san had already been stabbed.

770
01:01:42,850 --> 01:01:44,820
Then the one who killed him...

771
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:53,650
is my real father.

772
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:00,540
Did you make him do it?

773
01:02:04,340 --> 01:02:05,400
That's true.

774
01:02:06,970 --> 01:02:09,310
I've asked Hideyuki-san.

775
01:02:11,370 --> 01:02:15,080
To kill Okura Yuriko for me.

776
01:02:15,650 --> 01:02:17,800
No! Why did you do that?

777
01:02:17,880 --> 01:02:19,620
Shut up! Ah!

778
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:23,310
Even you...

779
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:28,940
If only you had never been born...

780
01:02:35,180 --> 01:02:36,200
Nao!

781
01:03:06,650 --> 01:03:07,800
Takigawa-san.

782
01:03:08,850 --> 01:03:10,970
I will not let you

783
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:14,320
hurt her, no matter what.

784
01:03:16,740 --> 01:03:18,420
That's right.

785
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:21,620
You have to protect her.

786
01:03:22,480 --> 01:03:26,820
Because you took both her father and mom.

787
01:03:29,020 --> 01:03:29,820
What?

788
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:31,400
What do you mean?

789
01:03:32,050 --> 01:03:34,650
Hideyuki-san didn't come that night.

790
01:03:35,420 --> 01:03:37,200
He was frightened.

791
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:40,840
A real useless man,

792
01:03:41,740 --> 01:03:46,050
the one who killed Itsuki-san...

793
01:03:49,720 --> 01:03:51,140
Takigawa-san...

794
01:03:55,080 --> 01:03:56,570
That's right.

795
01:03:58,540 --> 01:04:00,340
I killed him.

796
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:16,770
Have you ever imagined?

797
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:21,280
After you and my father had an affair,

798
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:27,660
what happens to a family
whose father is taken from them?

799
01:04:29,710 --> 01:04:31,970
I bought the Komineya's knives

800
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:33,300
you recommended.

801
01:04:33,370 --> 01:04:34,800
Did you really?

802
01:04:35,100 --> 01:04:38,100
She was the one who told me about it.

803
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:40,020
It's my favorite knife too.

804
01:04:40,540 --> 01:04:42,740
My wife is happy at how well it cuts.

805
01:04:43,420 --> 01:04:45,100
I'm glad to hear that.

806
01:04:46,220 --> 01:04:48,740
Takigawa-san, I've included one with white paste.

807
01:04:48,740 --> 01:04:50,740
For me, Kougetsuan is...

808
01:04:51,170 --> 01:04:53,710
A symbol of happiness for the whole family.

809
01:04:54,510 --> 01:04:55,850
I thought so...

810
01:04:57,250 --> 01:04:59,680
(Kogetsuan)
mom, what are you doing?

811
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:01,340
Hey, why are you...

812
01:05:01,770 --> 01:05:05,800
Your father had an affair with
the landlady of Kougetsuan.

813
01:05:06,910 --> 01:05:08,400
They even have a child!

814
01:05:11,180 --> 01:05:13,280
My father got more and more into it...

815
01:05:13,970 --> 01:05:16,560
He began to visit you frequently.

816
01:05:24,080 --> 01:05:27,740
I'll find you a new place to live and work at.

817
01:05:28,310 --> 01:05:30,970
I need you to pack your things now.

818
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:32,420
The landlady?

819
01:05:32,420 --> 01:05:33,400
Otherwise,

820
01:05:35,220 --> 01:05:38,510
do you want me to banish you
from this industry forever?

821
01:05:39,510 --> 01:05:44,020
I can tell everyone that
you're a dirty artisan who sleeps with her master.

822
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:48,880
Your daughter was called Sakura, right?

823
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:53,400
She's just an employee's daughter.

824
01:05:53,820 --> 01:05:56,620
yet she tries to get close to Tsubaki.

825
01:05:57,080 --> 01:06:01,400
You and your child are both shamelessly rude.

826
01:06:03,110 --> 01:06:05,820
Get out of here! Now!

827
01:06:06,370 --> 01:06:08,200
Don't come near me again.

828
01:06:09,220 --> 01:06:12,740
Come near Tsubaki nor Itsuki. ever!

829
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:15,370
Why...

830
01:06:18,910 --> 01:06:21,200
Why would someone like you...?

831
01:06:22,300 --> 01:06:23,050
What?

832
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:29,480
I love him

833
01:06:31,540 --> 01:06:33,080
for a long time.

834
01:06:34,940 --> 01:06:37,200
Please give me back my Itsuki-san.

835
01:06:39,850 --> 01:06:43,080
Please, Hideyuki-san, I've reached my limit.

836
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:45,710
Please Kill Okura Yuriko!

837
01:06:46,250 --> 01:06:48,540
There's no way I can do that.

838
01:06:49,250 --> 01:06:51,420
Then I don't mind even if Itsuki-san,

839
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:55,510
I need to split those two up forever.

840
01:06:55,880 --> 01:06:58,770
Anyway, calm down, I'll see you tonight.

841
01:06:58,770 --> 01:07:00,340
Leave the back door open.

842
01:07:00,480 --> 01:07:04,060
My mom heard the call.

843
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:05,540
Dad?

844
01:07:06,310 --> 01:07:08,110
At the landlady's.

845
01:07:20,860 --> 01:07:22,600
No, Mom!

846
01:07:28,420 --> 01:07:32,700
I can't believe my father went to you
until this moment.

847
01:07:34,510 --> 01:07:35,820
I couldn't let it happen.

848
01:07:36,710 --> 01:07:38,970
I just got word that
my wife was rushed to the hospital.

849
01:07:39,940 --> 01:07:42,050
Sorry, I can't make it tonight.

850
01:07:43,040 --> 01:07:44,250
I see.

851
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:51,480
I didn't mean to kill him.

852
01:07:54,340 --> 01:07:55,910
When they split up...

853
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:59,110
All I had to do was promise never to see him again.

854
01:08:00,420 --> 01:08:01,600
What are you doing?

855
01:08:08,420 --> 01:08:09,400
You are...

856
01:08:09,540 --> 01:08:10,880
Where's the landlady?

857
01:08:11,050 --> 01:08:12,420
What are you doing?

858
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:17,570
Stop it! It's all my fault.

859
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:21,400
Why... why are you protecting that woman?

860
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:43,140
Itsuki-san?

861
01:08:55,940 --> 01:08:57,080
Itsuki-san!

862
01:08:57,970 --> 01:09:01,940
Itsuki-san! Itsuki-san!

863
01:09:03,880 --> 01:09:06,080
When I first saw the knife...

864
01:09:06,370 --> 01:09:08,420
I thought it was Hideyuki-san's.

865
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:13,110
Somebody, ambulance! Somebody...!

866
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:21,050
Don't make a big deal out of it...
for the good of the shop...

867
01:09:21,910 --> 01:09:23,080
Itsuki-san.

868
01:09:24,510 --> 01:09:25,850
Kyoko.

869
01:09:28,620 --> 01:09:32,080
I'm really sorry about all this.

870
01:09:33,650 --> 01:09:37,800
I hurt you, I made you suffer.

871
01:09:38,820 --> 01:09:40,000
Itsuki-san.

872
01:09:41,480 --> 01:09:45,570
Please take care of Tsubaki... and this shop.

873
01:09:46,570 --> 01:09:50,140
No... I love you!

874
01:09:50,140 --> 01:09:54,310
I will always love only you!

875
01:10:01,140 --> 01:10:02,360
Yuriko...

876
01:10:33,250 --> 01:10:37,910
The knife is the same one she used.

877
01:10:39,370 --> 01:10:41,980
I'm going to kick you out of this shop.

878
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,710
That's what I've decided.

879
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:49,680
Once that woman was accused of murder,

880
01:10:51,310 --> 01:10:54,600
I thought everything was going
according to plan.

881
01:10:56,220 --> 01:10:57,740
How did this happen?

882
01:11:00,740 --> 01:11:03,540
But the real murderer was not Hideyuki.

883
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:06,080
Then who?

884
01:11:07,220 --> 01:11:12,540
15 years have passed since the incident
and I still don't know...

885
01:11:12,740 --> 01:11:14,140
It's been a while.

886
01:11:16,310 --> 01:11:17,080
Kyoko-san.

887
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:19,310
Kyoko-san

888
01:11:19,310 --> 01:11:21,310
You should come light an incense for my father.

889
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:26,770
That's when I realized it was you.

890
01:11:29,820 --> 01:11:31,020
How ironic.

891
01:11:32,770 --> 01:11:34,440
As a result, I am...

892
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:39,740
I made your wish come true,
even though I despise you.

893
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:44,200
But... My mom was falsely accused of a crime!

894
01:11:44,510 --> 01:11:46,620
Why didn't you tell me?

895
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:50,310
After a suicide attempt,

896
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:54,160
my mom was getting crazier and crazier.

897
01:11:55,680 --> 01:12:00,310
What would happen if she found out that
her son was a murderer?

898
01:12:00,310 --> 01:12:04,680
It's selfish! My mom lost her loves
and her dreams.

899
01:12:05,340 --> 01:12:08,600
She died alone, in despair!

900
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:14,850
Why did you appear before Nao-san 15 years
after the murder?

901
01:12:16,620 --> 01:12:21,020
My father suspected that it was the landlady.

902
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:23,020
He started distancing himself.

903
01:12:24,220 --> 01:12:28,700
And he cares about Yuriko-san...

904
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:32,700
(To Nao)

905
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:33,820
From Yuriko-san?

906
01:12:34,600 --> 01:12:36,560
She asked me to do it before she died.

907
01:12:38,200 --> 01:12:42,420
She wants to give it to her daughter
when she turns 20.

908
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:48,200
She's a descendant of the previous generation.

909
01:12:49,250 --> 01:12:52,220
She's the real successor to Kougetsuan.

910
01:12:53,220 --> 01:12:54,020
Eh?

911
01:12:55,480 --> 01:13:00,000
I made up my mind to turn myself in.

912
01:13:01,140 --> 01:13:03,850
Finally, I decided to look for Nao-chan.

913
01:13:04,900 --> 01:13:06,420
And then I found out

914
01:13:11,770 --> 01:13:16,770
She was making the same warm sweets as Yuriko-san.

915
01:13:18,770 --> 01:13:23,680
I was reminded of the gravity of
the crime I committed.

916
01:13:25,140 --> 01:13:28,820
(Kogetsuan) I want to bring Nao-chan
back to the place I took her from.

917
01:13:29,420 --> 01:13:32,680
That's for Yuriko-san and you.

918
01:13:32,680 --> 01:13:35,120
I thought it was the least
I could do to redeem myself.

919
01:13:35,800 --> 01:13:37,080
To do so,

920
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:41,620
I have to kick this woman out.

921
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:45,620
That's why you arranged for Nao arranged
to take over Kougetsuan?

922
01:13:47,020 --> 01:13:50,400
You sent the prank emails to her old work place.

923
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:52,340
(Hanaoka Nao's mom is a killer)
You're the one who got her sacked, aren't you?

924
01:13:54,310 --> 01:13:57,100
You also asked Yuko-san
to pretend to be her mom.

925
01:13:57,200 --> 01:13:58,680
And you asked the newspaper reporter

926
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:00,910
to look into the case.

927
01:14:01,110 --> 01:14:01,740
It's all you.

928
01:14:01,740 --> 01:14:03,060
That's right!

929
01:14:04,820 --> 01:14:06,600
I've always wanted to

930
01:14:10,250 --> 01:14:12,650
take everything away from you.

931
01:14:14,440 --> 01:14:18,740
But I still don't feel any better.

932
01:14:20,450 --> 01:14:26,310
When all is said and done,
you're still trying to bully her.

933
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:31,700
If you don't leave,

934
01:14:34,970 --> 01:14:36,280
I'm going to make you disappear.

935
01:14:37,310 --> 01:14:38,480
Stop!

936
01:14:42,170 --> 01:14:43,640
I called them.

937
01:14:45,740 --> 01:14:48,400
So that I can kill you and turn myself in.

938
01:14:49,680 --> 01:14:51,540
Oh....

939
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:55,050
It's finally over.

940
01:14:56,170 --> 01:14:57,080
I hate it...

941
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:00,710
Stop it! Stop it, Takigawa-san!

942
01:15:00,710 --> 01:15:01,880
Why?

943
01:15:03,250 --> 01:15:05,680
You hate this woman, too, don't you?

944
01:15:06,580 --> 01:15:07,940
I hate her.

945
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:10,420
But she is also...

946
01:15:14,140 --> 01:15:16,740
Tsubaki's mom.

947
01:15:29,340 --> 01:15:30,560
Stop it!

948
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:31,640
You're covering for me too!

949
01:15:31,650 --> 01:15:35,620
Nao doesn't want you to pile on the sins for her.

950
01:16:19,310 --> 01:16:20,280
Nao!

951
01:16:34,910 --> 01:16:36,600
Please don't

952
01:16:39,650 --> 01:16:42,160
take anyone else you love away from us.

953
01:17:14,020 --> 01:17:15,120
I will

954
01:17:16,450 --> 01:17:19,140
never forgive you, Takigawa-san.

955
01:17:21,560 --> 01:17:25,340
But if you hadn't told us the truth.

956
01:17:27,910 --> 01:17:29,570
I would still have hated this same Kougetsuan.

957
01:17:32,770 --> 01:17:35,020
The shop that my father and mom loved.

958
01:17:37,080 --> 01:17:38,880
I would still have

959
01:17:42,680 --> 01:17:48,220
countinued to hate Tsubaki, too.

960
01:17:52,820 --> 01:17:55,540
You're finally free from the curse.

961
01:18:00,250 --> 01:18:01,400
I...

962
01:18:06,910 --> 01:18:09,280
I wanted to make you happy.

963
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:12,820
Nao-chan.

964
01:18:17,370 --> 01:18:18,760
Sorry.

965
01:18:55,770 --> 01:18:57,320
It's a very important hand.

966
01:19:00,710 --> 01:19:03,300
I'm fine, thanks.

967
01:19:12,310 --> 01:19:15,740
Tsubaki, I think
you're even more blind than before.

968
01:19:16,850 --> 01:19:19,400
If so, it doesn't matter anymore.

969
01:19:19,510 --> 01:19:21,620
Please hurry up and heal them.

970
01:19:21,740 --> 01:19:24,620
If it's too late, why did I even take over...

971
01:19:33,280 --> 01:19:36,380
What we've been trying so hard to protect.

972
01:19:37,420 --> 01:19:39,300
What was it all about?

973
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:44,480
If you don't get caught up in the signs
and traditions of Kougetsuan,

974
01:19:45,600 --> 01:19:48,540
maybe the landlady was not the same as now.

975
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:50,280
The landlady?

976
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:02,900
It's over.

977
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:05,240
All.

Tsubaki-san,

985
01:21:05,050 --> 01:21:06,880
it's time to practice!

986
01:21:08,360 --> 01:21:09,860
Stay with me.

987
01:21:11,170 --> 01:21:14,620
If they don't recognise you as
the successor of Kougetsuan.

988
01:21:14,970 --> 01:21:17,880
You're going to be kicked out of here.

989
01:21:21,420 --> 01:21:22,100
Yes.

990
01:21:39,110 --> 01:21:43,840
We were finally a real family...

991
01:22:13,220 --> 01:22:15,080
Tsubaki.

992
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:49,680
(The Intensive Care Unit 2nd ICU)

993
01:23:13,680 --> 01:23:16,040
Are you... her son?

994
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:21,680
It was already too late by the time she arrived.

995
01:23:22,740 --> 01:23:26,400
She had just passed away moments ago.

996
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:35,110
Takatsuki-san.

997
01:23:38,080 --> 01:23:39,720
Organ donor?

998
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:40,340
Yes.

999
01:23:40,770 --> 01:23:45,220
She has recently signed up
to be an organ donor, and

1000
01:23:46,370 --> 01:23:48,420
she left a will for the organs

1001
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:50,340
to be prioritized for her family.

1002
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:52,020
Does that mean...

1003
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:57,820
She will donate her eyes for
your cornea surgery.

1004
01:23:59,250 --> 01:24:03,040
The landlady noticed
something wrong with Tsubaki's eyes

1005
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:05,110
and looked into its treatment.

1006
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:09,970
It's hard to find a donor immediately,

1007
01:24:11,110 --> 01:24:13,480
so she though, if something happened to her...

1008
01:24:13,540 --> 01:24:14,510
(Phone booth)
We're ready for you.

1009
01:24:15,220 --> 01:24:17,820
Please proceed as soon as possible.

1010
01:24:17,820 --> 01:24:18,850
(Eye Donation Registration)

1011
01:24:18,850 --> 01:24:21,310
No way, landlady. Accident on purpose.

1012
01:24:22,710 --> 01:24:24,680
In order to transplant the cornea,

1013
01:24:24,970 --> 01:24:28,340
it should be removed at the latest
within 24 hours of cardiac arrest....

1014
01:24:36,540 --> 01:24:39,200
Taking over Kougetsuan.

1015
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:42,820
was the biggest revenge you wanted.

1016
01:24:46,060 --> 01:24:50,740
But... that will never happen anymore.

1017
01:24:52,220 --> 01:24:56,960
I bet you never
cared about what happens to my eye.

1018
01:24:59,370 --> 01:25:00,450
Wait, Tsubaki.

1019
01:25:00,450 --> 01:25:04,940
Tsubaki-san,
this is not about Kougetsuan... or revenge.

1020
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:08,310
The landlady at that time was...

1021
01:25:08,970 --> 01:25:13,340
just a mom
who was desperate for her child.

1022
01:25:14,710 --> 01:25:18,420
To a sweets maker, an eye is everything.

1023
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:20,680
If you take sweets away from him.

1024
01:25:21,370 --> 01:25:25,260
Please, I'll do anything I can.

1025
01:25:25,510 --> 01:25:27,570
Please help him.

1026
01:25:27,820 --> 01:25:30,480
Please help Tsubaki!

1027
01:26:21,820 --> 01:26:23,020
Mom.

1028
01:27:14,220 --> 01:27:15,800
So you did it all for me?

1029
01:27:17,850 --> 01:27:19,850
You became the master of Kougetsuan,

1030
01:27:21,850 --> 01:27:24,060
so that I could get my eye surgery done.

1031
01:27:26,680 --> 01:27:28,370
That day 18 years ago,

1032
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:33,510
I took everything from you.

1033
01:27:40,050 --> 01:27:40,920
Nao.

1034
01:27:43,000 --> 01:27:43,850
Sorry.

1035
01:27:48,420 --> 01:27:51,710
The person who taught me
the joy of making sweets was...

1036
01:27:53,510 --> 01:27:54,600
That was Tsubaki.

1037
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:01,370
I want to keep making sweets.

1038
01:28:03,140 --> 01:28:07,620
I want Tsubaki to make sweets
that only you can make.

1039
01:28:08,620 --> 01:28:12,360
Freely, from your heart.

1040
01:28:15,650 --> 01:28:18,080
I promise I will protect Kougetsuan.

1041
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:29,340
You haven't changed at all.

1042
01:28:35,110 --> 01:28:36,360
I'll make it.

1043
01:28:39,370 --> 01:28:41,600
I'll make my own signature sweets.

1044
01:28:51,910 --> 01:28:52,800
Nao.

1045
01:28:59,050 --> 01:29:00,140
Nothing.

1046
01:29:04,820 --> 01:29:09,760
Good luck on your surgery.

1047
01:29:11,820 --> 01:29:12,640
Thanks.

1048
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:35,820
(One month later)

1049
01:29:39,820 --> 01:29:41,180
Good morning.

1050
01:29:41,510 --> 01:29:42,850
Good morning.

1051
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:45,570
Yamaguchi-san, please make

1052
01:29:45,570 --> 01:29:46,680
the matcha tea dough today.

1053
01:29:46,740 --> 01:29:47,110
Yes.

1054
01:29:47,370 --> 01:29:49,540
Nao-san. Please check the bean paste.

1055
01:29:49,710 --> 01:29:50,480
Yes.

1056
01:29:50,650 --> 01:29:51,940
Um, Nao-san.

1057
01:29:52,200 --> 01:29:54,910
What would you like to put at the front of
today's confectionery?

1058
01:29:55,050 --> 01:29:58,050
Today's specialty will be...

1059
01:29:59,220 --> 01:30:02,440
The peony and the daffodil.
How pretty.

1060
01:30:04,620 --> 01:30:07,200
Every decision I make will be tested.

1061
01:30:07,940 --> 01:30:11,020
(Kogetsuan)
Tsubaki had carried this burden for so long.

1062
01:30:11,370 --> 01:30:15,310
Please don't let Kougetsuan go under.

1063
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:19,140
I think I'll have some green dango today.

1064
01:30:19,250 --> 01:30:21,140
Yes, I understand.

1065
01:30:21,650 --> 01:30:23,750
And please bring me some Kogetsu monaka as usual.

1066
01:30:23,750 --> 01:30:25,510
(Kogetsu Monaka)
And please bring me some Kogetsu monaka as usual.

1067
01:30:25,600 --> 01:30:26,420
Sure.

1068
01:30:27,280 --> 01:30:30,480
Everyone comes here
expecting that nostalgic flavor.

1069
01:30:30,740 --> 01:30:33,280
or the happy memories tied to the flavor.

1070
01:30:35,650 --> 01:30:37,110
Long time no see.

1071
01:30:37,940 --> 01:30:40,480
Welcome, Mizoguchi-sensei.

1072
01:30:40,480 --> 01:30:42,880
Now that Hanagasumi is closes

1073
01:30:43,170 --> 01:30:44,650
this is the only other choice.

1074
01:30:46,680 --> 01:30:49,400
(Kogetsuan)
Absolute peace of mind.

1075
01:30:51,420 --> 01:30:55,200
That's what this old shop is all about.

1076
01:30:56,050 --> 01:30:59,020
I've been protecting it for a long time.

1077
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:03,170
For an unimaginably long time.

1078
01:31:41,000 --> 01:31:42,940
The incident 18 years ago...

1079
01:31:43,200 --> 01:31:45,480
I suspected you were involved in it.

1080
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:50,140
Yuko-san,

1081
01:31:51,910 --> 01:31:56,510
Can you continue to...take care of Nao-chan...

1082
01:31:57,420 --> 01:31:59,310
I know.

1083
01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:03,080
Well, she's like a daughter to me.

1084
01:32:04,910 --> 01:32:06,140
Thank you very much!

1085
01:32:06,140 --> 01:32:09,860
I told you I don't like trouble!

1086
01:32:17,680 --> 01:32:18,620
Nao-san.

1087
01:32:19,510 --> 01:32:21,060
Can you come when you're free?

1088
01:32:28,940 --> 01:32:30,020
How is it?

1089
01:32:31,710 --> 01:32:33,420
Jojima-kun. It's great.

1090
01:32:33,710 --> 01:32:36,570
Perfect, isn't it. the Shimaya's warabi mochi.

1091
01:32:37,650 --> 01:32:38,800
Thank you very much.

1092
01:32:39,140 --> 01:32:41,970
I've been able to pay off the debts of
the shop that I had to shoulder.

1093
01:32:42,370 --> 01:32:44,710
I'm thinking of reopening Shimaya.

1094
01:32:48,450 --> 01:32:49,850
Oh, let me help you.

1095
01:32:49,850 --> 01:32:52,310
I'm okay.

1096
01:32:52,310 --> 01:32:54,660
I can't always ask you to help me.

1097
01:32:55,620 --> 01:32:56,910
That's commendable.

1098
01:32:58,400 --> 01:33:02,220
Then can you help me instead this time?

1099
01:33:02,420 --> 01:33:03,820
It's a small shop but

1100
01:33:03,820 --> 01:33:07,200
I'll do my best to get you one of my employees.

1101
01:33:08,340 --> 01:33:11,370
Yes, I'll do my best.

1102
01:33:11,770 --> 01:33:15,110
She's not an employee, she's the landlady!

1103
01:33:15,110 --> 01:33:15,820
What?

1104
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:25,480
Osugi... he's been through a lot in his own way.

1105
01:33:26,620 --> 01:33:28,120
Shiori-san.

1106
01:33:28,450 --> 01:33:31,280
You should be absolutely happy.

1107
01:33:33,250 --> 01:33:34,140
Yes.

1108
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:39,880
Nao-san,

1109
01:33:41,170 --> 01:33:43,480
Tsubaki is getting discharged today, isn't he?

1110
01:33:45,050 --> 01:33:48,800
Will Tsubaki-san ever come back to the shop?

1111
01:33:48,800 --> 01:33:50,800
If he comes back here,

1112
01:33:51,480 --> 01:33:53,220
it means he will have to work for Nao-san.

1113
01:33:54,420 --> 01:33:56,110
It's not an easy thing to do.

1114
01:33:56,510 --> 01:33:59,020
Then... where will he go?

1115
01:34:14,860 --> 01:34:16,860
Ah! Sakura!

1116
01:34:17,020 --> 01:34:20,370
It's a spring name like mine.

1117
01:34:21,940 --> 01:34:23,880
Yes, let's make sweets.

1118
01:34:24,080 --> 01:34:27,680
Can I still make sweets here when I grow up?

1119
01:34:27,970 --> 01:34:28,740
Uhm.

1120
01:34:29,280 --> 01:34:33,650
I'll always be with Tsubaki..

1121
01:34:38,970 --> 01:34:43,510
Hey, would you like to marry me?

1122
01:34:52,110 --> 01:34:54,480
I'm going to marry this person.

1123
01:34:56,450 --> 01:35:00,420
Let's try it.
Acting like a married couple.

1124
01:35:00,770 --> 01:35:02,940
You overcome any obstacles
that stand in your way.

1125
01:35:03,140 --> 01:35:06,940
That's the kind of woman I'm in love with.

1126
01:35:12,850 --> 01:35:13,850
Nao.

1127
01:35:14,650 --> 01:35:15,910
Nao.

1128
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:18,250
Nao.

1129
01:35:51,820 --> 01:35:53,200
Tsubaki, how was your surgery?

1130
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:56,400
It went well.

1131
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:01,420
I'm glad. I'm really glad.

1132
01:36:02,570 --> 01:36:04,300
Is that what you want to know?

1133
01:36:11,140 --> 01:36:12,910
Come back to Kougetsuan.

1134
01:36:14,420 --> 01:36:15,760
Kougetsuan needs...

1135
01:36:18,650 --> 01:36:22,340
I need you, Tsubaki.

1136
01:36:25,450 --> 01:36:26,940
No matter how much I hated you,

1137
01:36:28,080 --> 01:36:29,420
how much we hurt each other,

1138
01:36:31,310 --> 01:36:33,170
I couldn't forget you.

1139
01:36:35,420 --> 01:36:37,220
Ever since the day we first met,

1140
01:36:39,140 --> 01:36:40,650
I've been...

1141
01:36:43,850 --> 01:36:45,250
Tsubaki.

1142
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:49,770
loving you like crazy.

1143
01:36:57,850 --> 01:37:02,050
There's only one place for me to go.

1144
01:37:06,310 --> 01:37:08,460
Can you stay with me forever?

1145
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:18,600
Nao.

1146
01:37:20,880 --> 01:37:22,360
I like you.

1147
01:37:30,570 --> 01:37:32,370
I love you.

1148
01:37:38,220 --> 01:37:40,570
There may be hard times ahead.

1149
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,370
We might hurt each other again.

1150
01:37:48,340 --> 01:37:52,650
Even so, we are still attracted to each other.

1151
01:37:56,080 --> 01:37:57,800
There is something

1152
01:37:58,820 --> 01:38:00,480
(Cursed in love)
wrong with us.
