1
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:07,260
Nao, I believe in you.

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:07,620
Nao-san,

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,320
(Undelucision Precepts)
could you be...

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,600
pregnant?

5
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:17,540
She's the daughter of a murderer?

6
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:20,800
What happened to your mother?

7
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,740
Who are you? Why did you lie about being my mom?

8
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:25,240
(Yuko's Incense Shop)
My restaurant opens at 6.

9
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:28,440
(Yuko's Incense Shop)
We will expose that two-faced scoundrel too.

10
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:33,320
Today is...a hot day, isn't it?

11
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:36,460
Here you go.

12
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:40,160
It looks very appetizing.

13
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,060
How did you find this restaurant?

14
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,320
Of course I asked Nao-san.

15
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:54,220
I've been meaning to catch up with her mother.

16
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,820
However, I thought

17
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,020
you lived in Wajima.

18
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,780
I was born in Wajima.

19
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:04,780
I moved here right

20
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,080
when Nao moved out.

21
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,080
That must have been 3 years ago...

22
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:15,900
but these cups

23
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:18,960
look much older than that.

24
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,760
Oh no! No!

25
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,240
I can't believe you'd serve drinks
with that inside.

26
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,300
Oh my God!

27
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,140
Hey!

28
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,080
Don't spread lies!

29
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:32,080
You're right.

30
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,740
This is too fine of an establishment to do this.

31
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:36,940
But...

32
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,860
I doubt anyone believes

33
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:43,280
what a liar says.

34
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,420
That's right.

35
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,520
I'm sure Nao-san will be coming here soon as well.

36
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:55,260
inviting you to her wedding ceremony.

37

(Wedding Invitation)
Please join us for the celebration,

38
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,240
If you are her real mother.

39
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,300
Are you open?

40
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,320
Welcome in.

41
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,040
Oh, no! Ii it isn't Mukoujima-sensei?

42
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,740
It's nice to see you here.

43
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,160
Well, Mizoguchi-sensei too.

44
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,300
Thank you for your support.

45
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,380
No, not at all.

46
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,100
Yes, sensei.

47
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:29,900
By the way, I know a much better
restaurant than this.

48
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,120
Why don't you all join me?

49
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,400
We'd love to.

50
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,860
Yes, of course.

51
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,620
Shall we head out?

52
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:46,340
Crushing a place like this is piece of cake.

53
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,120
Are you kidding me?

54
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,820
I can't keep up this ruse anymore.

55
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,420
I'm going to let you down.

How will Tsubaki react?

59
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:11,820
I'm scared.

60
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,620
I can't imagine it at all.

61
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,060
Are you okay?

62
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,460
Do you not feel well?

63
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,460
I'm fine.

64
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,220
I see.

Yes.

Tsubaki-san,

79
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,160
maybe we don't need to invite my mom.

80
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,280
She's frail

81
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,580
so all the far traveling might stress her out.

82
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:54,720
Far?

83
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,600
Well that's weird, Nao-san.

84
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:02,800
I thought she owns a restaurant

85
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,280
in Nagamachi?

86
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:06,420
How did you know?

87
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:07,360

88

93
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,260
Sorry.

94

How come?

127
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:30,200
I mean, I still have to run this restaurant.

I've never been a proper mother to her.

It's just like this leaf.

142
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,640
Completely unnecessary.

143
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:10,840
But...

When I first met Nao-san,

146
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,280
Nao-san made a cherry blossom leaf

147
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,760
to celebrate a marriage,

148
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,300
Wishing them many seasons and years together

149
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,300
My family is a little complicated

150
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,840
and I've only ever looked at my family as enemies.

151
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:43,160
So it meant a lot to me,

152
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,800
when she highlighted the importance of the leaf

153
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,280
And I have you to thank for

154

156
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,380
Can you take a look at it for us?

157
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:03,340
Tsubaki didn't come here
because of etiquette or manners.

158
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,500
Please! I beg you.

159
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,040

160
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,320
I'll be heading out now.

Sorry, Yuko-san.

163

00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,880
Aren't you going to marry him?

172
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,900
When I saw the test's result.

173
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,050
(Pregnant)
I was really happy.

174
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,320
I've been alone in the orphanage,

175
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,160
So I happy to have a family.

176
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,120
I realized...

177
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:33,020
I was more happy than scared.

178
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,380
In that case...

179
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:36,760
But...

180
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:39,600
Sakura's mother.

181
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,600
Nao! Nao!

182
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,880
Mom!

183
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,860
What? What's wrong?

184
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,280
Sorry, I...

185
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,900
The people I want to celebrate this with

186
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,200
won't be happy about it.

187
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,520
That... she won't want me to be with Tsubaki.

188
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:15,300
I don't know much about the details but...

189
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,480
I'm sure that person care a lot about you.

190
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:25,180
And definitely wants you to be happy.

191
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,360
If I were a mother, I would say

192
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,000
"I want you to be happy."

193
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,300
Already...

194
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:41,560
I wasn't planning to get involved anymore.

195
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,340
But now that you've involved me,
you better get your man.

196
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,080
For the sake of your baby too.

197
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:55,580
(Mom, can I be happy?)

198
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,220
(Can I stay with Tsubaki?)

199
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,140
I thought you'll stay overnight.

200
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,020
I wanted to see Tsubaki's face.

201
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,600
Next it's going to snow in the summer.

202
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,020
Can I help out?

203
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,000
Oh.

204
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,740
I don't want to lie to Tsubaki anymore.

205
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,680
(It will be okay. I'm sure he will)

206
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,520
accept the truth.

207
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,740
I'll tell him about the baby and who i really am

208
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,220
I'll tell him everything.

209
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,740
A business trip?

210
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,820
Yes, Warabimochi at the Tanabata Fair.

211
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,760
We'll be selling them at Otowa Department Store
in Tokyo from tomorrow.

212
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,820
On the first day,
they wanted Tsubaki-san present.

213
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,660
He said he was going on
the last bullet train today.

214
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,760
Tonight? By himself?

215
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,340
It sounds like... You already miss him!

216
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,240
It's not like that.

217
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:11,260
That representative was gorgeous too.

218
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:12,820
She was!

219
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:17,500
Shimaya's warabi mochi's also nationally famous?
Good for them.

220
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:18,780
Yes.

221
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:21,240
Let's have a confession time! What do you say?

222
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,400
Tsubaki-san,

223
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:28,460
Can I get some time with you
before you go to Tokyo tonight?

224
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:29,520
Yes.

225
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,740
Then come with me.

226
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,520
I want to stop by a place.

227
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:39,060
(Takaragawa)

228
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,640
Fireflies!

229
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:53,800
Oh.

230
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,980
Aren't you glad you wore a yukata now?

231
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,400
They are beautiful.

232
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,960
Come here.

233
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,920
Every year at this tim
it's a bit of a spectacle.

234
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:23,320
I've never seen real fireflies before.

235
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,340
We can talk about it here.

236
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,980
What? Were Tsubaki-san going to tell me something?

237
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,260
Am I allowed to say that?

238
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,580
There's a caterpillar in there.

239
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,640
Oh, no! Ah...

240
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,760
You're too surprised, right?

241
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,660
Hey!

242
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:46,320
Was that... all you wanted to say?

243
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:50,400
Sometimes it's nice

244
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,040
to learn about each other slowly over time.

245
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,420
Today I found out you've never seen fireflies

246
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,680
and that you hate caterpillars.

247
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:03,460
We can take our time getting to know each other

248
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,720
We have a whole lifetime ahead of us.

249
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,860
Speaking of which,

250
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,060
you don't even have a ring yet.

251
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,120
Let's have it ready by the wedding.

252
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,560
I like it better this way.

253
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,900
It won't let in the way of sweets making and

254
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,600
it'll always be sparkling in my heart.

255
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,000
The most beautiful ring in the world.

256
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,420
Thank you.

257
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,400
I want to

258
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,640
tell you one more thing.

259
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:20,960
Nao.

260
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,440
I love you.

261
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,040
Tsubaki-san!

262
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,180
Can I ask you something?

263
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,520
What?

264
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:10,240
How did you feel about your father?

265
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,180
My Father?

266
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:17,640
Did you love him? Your father.

267
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:24,180
It was less love...

268
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,000
and more admiration.

269
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,860
He was very strict but

270
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:38,500
He's the only one who would hug me.

271
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,700
As a child...

272
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:44,600
I felt protected in his large hands.

273
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:48,680
I wanted to be like my father...

274
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,080
A parent like him.

275
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:06,720
Tsubaki-san, um...

276
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,540
I...

277
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,760
Let's see...

278
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,920
Tsubaki-san.

279
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,200
Were you here?

280
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,560
You need to get going or you'll miss the train.

281
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,460
Sorry. Let's continue after I get back.

282
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:26,400
Yes.

283
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,980
(I couldn't say it.)

284
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:47,140
(Kougetsuan)

285
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,320
I'm counting on you.

286
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:50,060
Yes.

287
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,720
Grand Master?

288
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,600
What's going on?

289
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,440
He just announced that

290
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,020
he's having the Twilight Tea Ceremony

291
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,960
a week early.

292
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:08,460
What?

293
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,460
The one that was on the wedding day?

294
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,580
Yes.

295
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,920
That's...

296
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,660
I bet it means

297
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,060
has accepted your marriage.

298
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:20,540
But what do we make? This is so last minute.

299
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:23,200
We have to submit samples to

300
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,100
Grand Master immediately.

301
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,700
It can't be helped.

302
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,180
I'll have to do it.

303
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,080
Let me come up with the ideas.

304
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,040
What?

305
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,340
Please!

306
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,960
Thank you very much.

307
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,200
Excuse me. What is this sweet called?

308
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:46,720
It's called uchi-mixu, fit for the summer.

309
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,600
I'll take five of them.

310
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,100
As you wish.

311
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,740
(Kougetsu)
I'm so glad I found the sweets I like.

312
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,480
As expected from Kougetsuan.

313
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,140
Thank you.

314
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,880
The Twilight Tea Ceremony is coming up.

315
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,240
I'm looking forward to it.

316
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,000
That's right.

317
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:13,480
Kyoko-san, you should come light
an incense for my father.

318
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,600
I'm sure he would appreciate that.

319
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:17,040
See you soon.

320
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,960
okay, I will graft it as you requested.

321
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:32,040
Did Tsubaki make these sweets?

322
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,180
No, Grandfather.

323
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,220
A girl named Sakura made it.

324
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,000
Wow!

325
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,780
Grandfather, are you still unwell?

326
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,860
He can't help it.

327
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,800
He lost his dear son.

328
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,420
Since he lied to everyone saying
it was an illness.

329
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,840
he can't even mourn the loss properly.

330
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:14,940
Grandfather, I made this sweet.

331
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:18,080
Please eat this and get well soon.

332
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,340
It's different.

333
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,840
I don't want this one.

334
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:38,560
I want to eat the sweets that Sakura made.

335
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,900
Sakura...

336
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:02,060
This must mean he accepted us...and Tsubaki

337
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:06,000
I can't wait to tell Tsubaki. He'll be so happy.

338
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,620
Excuse me.

339
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,540
Yes.

340
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,000
Nao-san, do you have some time?

341
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,460
(Haseya Inn)
Eh... so...

342
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:18,240
the mother of the girl who crashed your wedding

343
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:20,460
murdered someone?

344
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:21,600
Yes.

345
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:23,980
There was an apprentice named Hanaoka Nao

346
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,560
at a sweets shop in Komastu.

347
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:29,400
She got fired right around

348
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,220
the time your wedding got canceled.

349
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:33,060
Fired?

350
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,560
They were getting an anonymous email everyday.

351
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,360
Saying that her mother was a murderer.

352
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,720
Oh no, I no longer want to eat anything
from Kougetsuan's anymore.

353
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:50,280
But maybe Tsubaki-san doesn't know.

354
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:56,780
- If he knew...
- Shiori, you are not to stir up any trouble.

355
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:59,980
Your marriage talk with
Kadokura-san is going well.

356
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,400
Mother, I'm planning to...

357
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,360
I will not allow you to reject them.

358
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,140
Father.

359
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:04,960
There now.

360
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,840
I just ran into Shirafujiya-san.

361
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,200
Tsubaki-san and that woman have
formally set a wedding date.

362
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:21,360
Press down a little,

363
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,100
and then lift it.

364
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,260
Wow! You're so good at this, Nao-san!

365
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,840
Oh, um...

366
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,300
I'll bring you some tea.

367
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,840
Your wedding is coming up.

368
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,280
Yes.

369
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,660
Um... Nao-san, I...

370
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:46,580
Jojima.

371
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,680
Sorry, but can you run an errand?

372
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,780
Oh, yes.

373
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,040
I'll be back in a bit.

374
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:56,120
Yes.

375
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:02,300
I'm sorry. Did I come by too quickly?

376
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:05,100
Oh, no, not at all! Thank you very much.

377
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:07,520
Hey.

378
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,340
So.. what is up with that room?

379
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,000
I don't know.

380
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,880
But Nao-san is very interested in that room.

381
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,820
so I'll lend it to her for a little while.

382
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,760
I made it back in this room again.

383
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,520
I used to hide and sleep in the closet.

384
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,440
He won't be back so soon, right...

385
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:40,980
I'll just take a quick look.

386
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:53,040
That one spot is different from the rest.

387
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:20,860

so I sent them to you, my lover.)

396

I have a bad feeling about this...

397
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,600
I want to

398
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,980
tell you one more thing.

399
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,180
Once I open this...

400
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:13,540
Nao.

00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,280
I love you.

404
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,600
Thank you for coming so early this morning.

405
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,900
I'm glad to be of service.

406

Hurry up!

00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,960
Wait! Wait!

409
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,740
Is something wrong?

410
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,300
She just resembled someone I knew as a child.

411
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:55,120
Was it a childhood friend? That sounds nice.

412
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:56,800
No.

413
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,160
It's nothing like that.

436
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,540
I always thought...

437
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:41,780
I shouldn't ask about my father.

438
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,820
Is he...

439
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,620

No way.

442
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,880

Why...

446
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:40,200
Just when I decided to tell Tsubaki everything

447
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,340
(DNA Genetic Testing & Analysis)

Tsubaki will never get over the Kougetsuan.

451
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:13,540
Because he is not my real grandson.

452

Tsubaki is not the Master's real child.

453

We're not siblings.

454

But then, who is Tsubaki's father?

455
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:27,260
Mom was going to give this to me one day

(DNA Genetic Testing & Analysis)
Not Tsubaki-san.

To prove that I'm the real heir to Kougetsuan
instead of Tsubaki.

458
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,000

459

00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,140
Sorry.

461
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:51,820
Grand Master, have you accepted

462
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:53,780
Tsubaki as the successor for Kougetsuan?

463
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,440
The thing I fear most...

464
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:02,500
to have Kougetsuan die with me.

465

are my direct decedents!

468

469
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:30,920
I'm

470
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:35,760
searching for a specific girl.

471
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,020
Sakura

472
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,820
was her name.

473
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,580
Sakura was

474
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:48,980
the child of the woman my son loved.

475
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,100
15 years ago,

476
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,440
she used to live here.

477
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:59,440
She must be his real child.

478
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,960
When I realized that,

479
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:05,880
she had already disappeared and...

480
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:13,580
I've told Tsubaki to look for her.

481
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,220
Have you...

482
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,100
Have you heard anything?

483
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,520
I don't know. I don't know anything.

484
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:30,940
Right.

485
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,480
Tsubaki...

486
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:50,200
Tsubaki really saw it that day.

487
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:54,520
And then he realized...

488
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,520
even as a child,

489
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,540
he's said,

490
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,740
he wasn't his father's real child.

491
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:06,140
How shocked he must have been!

492
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:08,480
He must have been so hurt...

493
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:12,020
The reason why he hates Sakura

494
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:13,450
is not just

495
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:16,060
because her mother killed his father.

496
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:20,860
If Sakura showed up one day,

497
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:23,380
he would lose this store.

498
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,560
...not let anyone else take over this store.

499
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:27,580
he would lose everything...

500
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:31,060
I dedicated everything
towards taking over this store.

501
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,580
Sakura would get it all.

502
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,720
I can't hide my pregnancy.

503
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,720
But I can't reveal who I am.

504
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:56,540
I don't want you to hurt him.

505
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,800
We have a whole lifetime ahead of us.

506
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:04,680
Nao, I love you.

507
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,940
From the front of Tsubaki...

508
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,280
I have to disappear.

509
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:33,340
(Kougetsuan)

510
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,820
Sorry I'm back late, everyone.

511
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:38,220
Did anything happen while I was gone?

512
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:41,220
Well, Grand Master suddenly announced

513
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,720
he would change the date of the tea ceremony.

514
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:45,580
Just now...

515
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:47,840
Nao-san just took a sweet to him.

516
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:54,340
Are you coming to my wedding?

517
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:59,240
You must be feeling great

518
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,720
to have changed my mind.

519
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,080
I just...

520
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:08,500
want to take the store
that was promised to my father.

521
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,400
Rest assured.

522
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:13,200
I'll drop dead soon enough.

523
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,620
Excuse me.

524
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,600
Wait.

525
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:25,960
Who made this sweet?

526
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,720
This taste...

527
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:34,540
I think I've had eaten somewhere before...
a long time ago.

528
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:40,100
Nao-san just took a sweet to him.

529
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,220
Excuse me.

530
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:51,580
Nao.

531
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,820
I've never seen Grand Master like that before.

532
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:16,360
No, wait... it happened before.

533
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:19,220
A girl named Sakura made it.

534
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:28,100
I've already convinced myself once before.

535
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,080
But is Nao really...

536
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:51,820
♪Teru teru bozu, teru teru bozu.♪

537
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:57,220
(Kougetsuan)
♪Please bring the sunshine tomorrow.♪

538
00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:05,040
♪If you still bring the clouds and rain,.♪

539
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:13,320
♪then i will chop your neck off in a swoosh.♪

540
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:18,940
Mom.

541
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,540
You have a guest.

542
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,080
A guest?

543
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:32,380
- Who's come to see me?
- I'm a guest.

544
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:35,580
The woman you were supposed to marry.

545
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:38,200
Your ex-fiancee.

546
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,600
I'm going to marry this woman.

547
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,640
Thank you for your patience.

548
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:52,380
Sorry to keep you waiting, Shiori-san.

549
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:03,200
It was a selfish act.

550
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,020
We apologise for the inconvenience
caused to Haseya-san.

551
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,620
We sincerely apologise.

552
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:11,300
Don't apologise, Tsubaki-san.

553
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,020
That time...

554
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,240
I'm glad we didn't get married.

555
00:38:19,660 --> 00:38:21,560
It was a decision between the families.

556
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,520
More importantly, the sweets from Kougetsuan,

557
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,500
I'm just sad I don't get to eat any more

558
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:30,100
I loved it so much.

559
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,460
Is it alright if I come to the

560
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:38,900
Twilight Tea Ceremony?

561
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:43,000
I look forward it to every year.

562
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,660
That's fine, if...

563
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,480
Shiori-san are okay with it.

564
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:55,120
Really? I'm so glad.

565
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:57,020
Thank you very much.

566
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:59,380
Is that why you're here today?

567
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:02,220
Oh... no.

568
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:07,860
I had something I wanted you to know.

569
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:14,300
Tsubaki-san is going to marry Nao, aren't you?

570
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,900
Nao-san.

571
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:21,980
She's so mature and confident.

572
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:27,440
But Tsubaki-san...

573
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:31,260
Nao's mother committed the crime.

574
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,740
Did you know that?

575
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:35,320
Eh?

576
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,380
This way, please.

577
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,660
How did you find this place?

578
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,720
Sorry to bother you.

579
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:21,100
I asked the host of the Soukunkai.

580
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,880
You must be in need of my help.

581
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,520
The crime?

582
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:34,400
I heard a weird rumor from an acquaintance.

583
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:38,780
He said, "Hanaoka Nao's mother is a murderer".

584
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,620
Sakura's mother.

585
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:54,300
It may not be the same person as
the one Tsubaki-san is marrying.

586
00:40:54,380 --> 00:40:55,520
But I was still worried...

587
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,400
Shiori-san.

588
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,940
Thank you for your concern.

589
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:05,040
But she's not the Nao I know.

590
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:09,720
If that's all you want to talk about,
then excuse me.

591
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,980
I have work to do.

592
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,800
Tsubaki-san.

593
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:22,760
My name is Hanaoka Nao.

594
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:24,620
It's not Sakura.

595
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:28,140
Nao, I believe in you.

596
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,720
I will believe her.

597
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:37,780
I will not marry Tsubaki-san.

598
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:43,160
Do you know a place that

599
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:45,160
can hire me and keep it a secret?

600
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,740
No, wait a minute. Why?

601
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:54,400
Please, please.

602
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,780
Are you sure you want to do that?

603
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:01,240
Will you not regret leaving that place?

604
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,280
I'll always regret it.

605
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,640
That day, 15 years ago.

606
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:27,500
Shiori-san, could it be...

607
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:32,300
Are you still in love with Tsubaki?

608
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,920
No, um...

609
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,900
If that's the case...

610
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,480
You'd better leave now.

611
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:49,740
It's not easy to fall in love with
someone who's really in love.

612
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:52,640
The road of thorns.

613
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:55,880
No matter how far you go.

614
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:02,080
(Takigawa)
15 years ago.

615
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,600
My father.

616
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:08,820
I told you how he used to buy
your mother sweets every month.

617
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:14,120
But 15 years ago, at the end of winter.

618
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,320
When Tsubaki started making sweets,

619
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:19,620
my father was too busy to go to the store.

620
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:23,320
(Kougetsuan)
I should have gone instead...

621
00:43:23,940 --> 00:43:25,760
I felt embarrassed about that too.

622
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,260
(Kougetsuan)
I figured there will always be next year.

623
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:34,240
But I didn't come next year.

624
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:37,840
The master of Kougetsuan was.

625
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:41,220
murdered, rather than died of illness.

626
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:44,720
While still being accused of murder,

627
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:47,980
your mother passed away, according to my dad.

628
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,400
I regreted it.

629
00:43:52,140 --> 00:43:53,660
I wish I'd have gone to the store.

630
00:43:54,620 --> 00:43:56,380
I wish I had known her more and
gotten to know her better.

631
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:59,080
And maybe, just maybe...

632
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:01,420
Even now, I could have still
enjoyed her sweet today!

633
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:07,260
You are...

634
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:10,480
If you are leaving that house,

635
00:44:11,960 --> 00:44:13,280
are you sure you won't regret it?

636
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,200
I've yet to...

637
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:26,180
find the truth of that incident.

638
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,760
The two of them who were in love,

639
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:31,900
but couldn't be together.

640
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:37,640
(Takaragawa)
That day, 15 years ago.

641
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:42,140
someone desperately wanted
the master to disappear.

642
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:44,840
Who?

643
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:55,900
What are you looking at, there?

644
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:00,260
Welcome home.

645
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:05,840
Where have you been away?

646
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:08,160
A little walk.

647
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,800
I've been a bit tired lately.

648
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:15,420
That's true.

649
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:17,820
You've gained some weight.

650
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:19,240
Huh?

651
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:23,600
About that,

652
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:26,380
we haven't finished our talk.

653
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:35,000
Oh... I've forgotten.

654
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:39,380
Sorry, I'm probably interrupting you.

655
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:49,440
What's the matter? Suddenly.

656
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,840
I don't need a reason to do this.

657
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:56,720
You're going to be mine soon.

658
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:09,620
What we are going to make for the tea ceremony?

659
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:14,320
Moonflowers.

660
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:17,000
Moonflowers?

661
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:20,360
A flower that falls in one night.

662
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,900
A fleeting love.

663
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,140
I want to be with you, even for a moment.

664
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:42,700
Not for a minute, not for a second longer.

665
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:50,320
I'm sure this will

666
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:55,000
be another sin.

667
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:05,860
(Takatsuki)

668
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:10,460
I can't stay until the wedding.

669
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:12,900
I've got to find the truth before then.

670
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:19,180
The murder happened up ahead.

671
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:23,580
In the main house, in the master's bedroom.

672
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:31,160
The knife next to the master had

673
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:33,580
fingerprints that belong to mom.

674
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,880
There were no other suspects.

675
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:38,760
But it's really true?

676
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:41,020
What I saw at that time...

677
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:43,620
Was it really just Tsubaki and the Master?

678
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:48,280
Maybe I'm forgetting something...

679
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,700
It's completely closed.

680
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:26,340
Even the main door.

681
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:27,960
Nao.

682
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:31,120
What's the matter with you? In this place?

683
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:32,420
Yamaguchi-san.

684
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:35,240
I'm a bit lost.

685
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:39,860
No one is allowed to enter that room.

686
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:43,040
It was closed by the Grand Master.

687
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:44,240
The Grand Master?

688
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:47,260
Was it because of the incident?

689
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,080
Probably.

690
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:54,080
It has not been open for 15 years
except on special occasions.

691
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:55,500
A special day?

692
00:48:56,040 --> 00:48:57,620
It is the day of the "Twilight Tea Ceremony".

693
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:03,420
Once a year, after the tea ceremony ends,

694
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:07,740
The Grand Master drinks only
one cup of tea in this room.

695
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,620
It's like he's talking to the dead son.

696
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:15,980
It only opens after the twilight Tea Ceremony

697
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:19,540
You know a lot, don't you?

698
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:23,400
Yamaguchi-san, have you been
here since the master was alive?

699
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:26,980
Oh... no, I've only heard rumours.

700
00:49:28,560 --> 00:49:31,500
More importantly,
are you okay with Tsubaki-san?

701
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:37,080
No, I just felt there's a distance
between the two of you again.

702
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:41,540
I was happy for him.

703
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:46,080
Tsubaki-san, who used to show
only a stern expression.

704
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:50,200
Surprised, angry, laughing.

705
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,920
He's started to show a lot of
different expressions.

706
00:49:55,900 --> 00:49:57,380
It's all thanks to Nao-san.

707
00:49:59,100 --> 00:50:02,760
Please stay close to Tsubaki-san.

708
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:16,460
You liar!

709
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:19,080
Why did you say there was a dispute?

710
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:22,180
I knew you didn't belong in this house.

711
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:25,120
That's why I can neglect his death.

712
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:31,900
My last will, chapter 1.

713
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:38,320
I, Takatsuki Sojirom will give all my assets to

714
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:43,340
my grandson, Takatsuki Tsubaki.

715
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:48,460
Unless a grandchild with
Takatsuki blood appear

716
00:50:48,460 --> 00:50:53,160
in which case the grandchild will
inherit everything.

717
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:56,520
What is that?

718
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:59,400
Now you can be sure that
nothing will happen to you.

719
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:01,240
Father!

720
00:51:01,820 --> 00:51:04,560
Tsubaki is the rightful heir.

721
00:51:04,560 --> 00:51:08,140
Only Tsubaki will inherit Kougetsuan!

722
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:10,380
It doesn't matter what you say.

723
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,380
This means...

724
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:14,080
I decide.

725
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:27,420
Let's get start.

726
00:51:29,080 --> 00:51:29,800
Yes.

727
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:31,580
(Takaragawa)

728
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:34,520
(Takaragawa)
In the sweltering heat,

729
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:37,700
The Grand Master's tea party is coming.

730
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:40,580
(Preview / The criminal is Kougetsu's lady?)
Please tell me the truth

731
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:41,060
(Preview / The criminal is Kougetsu's lady?)
No.

732
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:42,500
You are a snake.

733
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:44,700
Why you don't have any desire from me?

734
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,900
(Finally, Nao reveals her indentity)
I am Sakura.

735
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:49,540
Sakura...Such a day will come.

736
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:51,340
(Part 1- Last episode)
I've always waited the day like that.

737
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:52,520
I'm waiting you here, Tsubaki.

738
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:53,300
Nao.
