1
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:05,840
I'm Sakura.

2
00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:08,220
I was that artisan's,

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,340
Ookura Yuriko's daughter.

4
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:12,340
You heard that, didn't you?

5
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:14,560
Did you just say you were Sakura?

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,840
It's a lie, isn't it?

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,720
Why?

8
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,520
There's a fire! There's smoke in the house.

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:22,500
Only the Grand Master.

10
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,500
I'll wait for you here, Tsubaki!

11
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,700
You came to take everything away from me.

12
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:28,820
Tsubaki-san!

13
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:32,920
We're all trapped

14
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:34,660
(Kougetsuan)
by the curse

15
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,720
Our young master saved this set.

16
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,720
He went back to retrieve these tools!

17
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:40,720
He chose to save that instead...

18
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,720
I want to forget everything and Tsubaki.

19
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,560
I don't think I can marry you.

20
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,740
There's something I can't give up.

21
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:49,960
You want to work here?

22
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:52,940
I don't want to give up on myself anymore.

23
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:54,180
(Three years later)
What do you mean?

24
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,180
Samidare Pavilion will be working

25
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,360
with another sweets shop.

26
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,920
What's the name of the shop?

27
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,940
It was Hanagasumi, I believe.

28
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:03,260
Hanagasumi?

29
00:01:03,260 --> 00:01:04,840
(Hanagasumi)
Will Tsubaki notice that it's your sweets?

30
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,080
How about Tsubaki-kun?

31
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,060
It doesn't matter.

32
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,900
I'm going to erase

33
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:10,460
Kougetsuan as you know it.

34
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,560
(Kougetsuan)
What do you mean, Tsubaki-san?

35
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,560
Why didn't we get the order?

36
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,980
I'm sorry, It was my fault.

37
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,600
They went with Hanagumi Instead.

38
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,140
Ever since their pavilion opened 60 years ago,

39
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,000
they've served our sweets every year.

40
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,860
I'm going to ask you to talk to them again!

41
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:31,700
We can still win back the business.

42
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:37,860
Samidare Pavilion hosts
a Spring Garden Party every year.

43
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:41,180
Next week, they will pick their sweets.

44
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:48,200
I'll make the sweets for the selection.

45
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,260
(Hanagasumi)
Kougetsuan's yopung master will?

46
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:54,840
(Hanagasumi)
And the theme is moon?

47
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,580
I understand.

48
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,840
Please tell them I'm looking forward to it.

49
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:11,180
(Magazine Reporter / Shimoyama Haruki)
Excuse me. I'm a magazine reporter.

50
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,140
(Takatsuki)
A reporter?

51
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:18,140
I'd like to ask about the late master's
murder case 18 years ago.

52
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:18,920
What?

53
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,600
"It's quite an interesting story."

54
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,500
That's the tip I received.

55
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,360
I chose this shop over Nao that day.

56
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,780
I'm sure she has moved on already.

57
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,980
Shiori-san?!

58
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,860
(Hamabe Minami)

59
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,700
(Yokohama Ryusei)

60
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,660
=Cursed in love=

61
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,060
Sorry for bothering you.

62
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,340
It's been 3 years, hasn't it?

63
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,660
I was really surprised to see you.

64
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,540
What have you been up to all these years?

65
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,180
I was an apprentice at a place in Tokyo.

66
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:36,480
I finally managed to opened
my own shop 3 months ago.

67
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,480
so I came back to Kanazawa.

68
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:41,280
That's amazing! You have your own shop?

69
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,200
What about you, Shiori?

70
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,520
I am, um....

71
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,880
working at Kougetsuan.

72
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,380
At Kougetsuan?

73
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,120
I see.

74
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,920
I'm sure the customers
love coming by just to see you.

75
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,640
Um... doesn't it bother you?

76
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:11,440
The umm...competition between customers and...

77
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,200
It doesn't bother me.

78
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,080
But...

79
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,000
"New Moon".

80
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,560
I remember making that yokan a long time ago.

81
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,920
Kougetsuan right now is exactly like that.

82
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:33,580
Clouded in darkness and blind.

83
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:37,760
Right now,

84
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,940
Tsubaki isn't making any sweets, is he?

85
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:45,120
That's because
he's busy running the shop and...

86
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,720
To make the most beautiful and delicious sweets.

87
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,120
What else could be more important than that?

88
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,840
He chooses not to make them.

89
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,400
He's taking his brand
and his customers for granted.

90
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:03,040
I doubt I will lose to a place like that.

91
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,040
You are wrong!

92
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:09,640
Kougetsuan is still a greatly respected shop!

93
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,300
I can't believe she still loves him..

94
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,660
That's great, Shiori-san.

95
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,680
18 years ago, the late master had a mistrest.

96
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,980
The matron, out of revenge,

97
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,280
stabbed her husband to death.

98
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,340
If it's true,

99
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:40,040
I imagine it'll bake a pretty good article.

100
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,040
Then I'm sure you also know

101
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:44,860
that she had an alibi.

102
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:47,940
But...

103
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:51,100
Why is anyone talking about this again.

104
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,020
Welcome back.

105
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,140
What's wrong?

106
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:13,220
I... I met Shiori-san.

107
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,560
So?

108
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,600
It happened so fast that she took me by surprise.

109
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,780
I may have said too much to her.

110
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,000
But don't worry.

111
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,720
I don't think she'll tell Tsubaki about me.

112
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:29,780
Takigawa-san...

113
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,040
Oh! You're not crying?

114
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:40,100
Darn, I thought it was
finally my turn to cheer you up.

115
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,860
Stop treating me like a child all the time.

116
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,660
You know better than anyone else.

117
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,680
everything I suffered through.

118
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,460
Takigawa-san introduced me to shop.

119
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,900
(Three years ago - Hakusan City)
(Wasa - The Sweets Shop)

120
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,160
where i could finally focus on making sweets.

121
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:03,980
But that didn't last long..

122
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,820
Welcome.

123
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,860
We are the prefectural police.
Are you Hanaoka Nao?

124
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,300
Yes, I am...

125
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,420
The detectives said the were
re-investigating the fire.

126
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,240
Someone claimed thay saw you.

127
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:20,000
go into Grand Master's bedroom that night.

128
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:23,220
They were no doubt wordking for Matron!

129
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:24,960
Just like with my mom.

130
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,660
She's trying to turn me into a criminal!

131
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:31,700
Kougetsuan has been in business for 400 years.

132
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,200
In your long history,

133
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,340
I'm sure you've had challenging times

134
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,020
(Guest Takatsuki Kyoko) Yes, about 15 years ago.

135
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:43,540
It really stressed me out when a demon came to us.

136
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,920
A demon?

137
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,800
She took advantage of my generous husband

138
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,050
(Rediscoveryfrom fire - Spirit to protect tradition)
and almost ruined the store.

139
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,620
(Rediscoveryfrom fire - Spirit to protect tradition)
She was a very sneaky artisan.

140
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:56,480
But the gods were looking after us.

141
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,420
(The sweets shop, Kougetsuan)
That demon

142
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,060
(The sweets shop, Kougetsuan)

143
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,680
suffered divine punishment.

144
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,620
You can't get away with--

145
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,320
Why...

146
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,320
I just want to forget...

147
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,700
But the Kougetsuan curse follows me everywhere.

148
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:15,980
Ah!

149
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:18,500
Ugh!

150
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,020
Sakura's mother.

151
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:37,280
Mom... I'm sorry.

152
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,900
Nao-chan... Nao-chan!

153
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,740
Nao-chan!

154
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,880
Nao-chan...

155
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,780
Takigawa-san...

156
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:58,700
You scared me.

157
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:01,380
The shop owner said you've been gone.

158
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:07,000
Takigawa-san. I'm sorry.

159
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:09,740
I can't...

160
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,300
Nao-chan...

161
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,140
Nao, you have to stay awake!

162
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,120
If you'ne gone,

163
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,600
who's going to remember your mom?

164
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,380
There will be nothing left of her!

165
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,080
Not her kindness, nor her warmth...

166
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,760
She'll be dying for the second time!

167
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,960
That night, as Takigawa-san carried me,

168
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,760
I thought about my mom's letters.

169
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,280
All her unsent letters.

170
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,760
to the late master.

171
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,980
"Dear Takatsuki-sama,

172
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:44,680
"Every day, I think it's a miracle

173
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,940
to have met you in middle school."

174
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:51,540
"As someone who lost thir parents at a young age,"

175
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:56,320
"you were the first one
who taught me the warmth of love."

176
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,720
"If I could have any wish,"

177
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,780
"I would love to sell

178
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,680
my sweets at Kougetsuan one day."

179
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:09,200
"I know it very well, that I can't be the matron."

180
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:14,320
"But I'm happy just imagining us together."

181
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,540
"That's all I need..."

182
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,480
All her unspoken emotion

183
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:21,920
and the little bit of happiness she had.

184
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,700
That demon.

185
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,840
suffered divine punishment.

186
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:28,360
As long as that women is at Kougetsuan,

187
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,440
she will continue to slander my dead mother.

188
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,240
That's why

189
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,300
You made that decision, right!?

190
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:42,420
Takigawa-san... Please help me.

191
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,240
I promise I'll repay you.

192
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,720
Please...

193
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,920
Give me my own shop.

194
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,500
My mom's dream was taken from her
but I'll make it come true.

195
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:09,600
That's all I want right now.

196
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,040
That's what I decided.

197
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,800
After that incident,

198
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,080
I've only eaten Kougetsuan's sweets once.

199
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,040
But I knew on that first bite,

200
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,880
that TsubakI wasn't making them.

201
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,560
I was devastated!

202
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,360
Was this it? Was this what

203
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,360
Tsubaki risked his life to save?

204
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,200
In the end, he just wanted Kougetsuan for himself.

205
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,880
He didn't care about making sweets.

206
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,240
So you're serious

207
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,780
about taking over Kougetsuan

208
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,600
and making it yours?

209
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:56,900
(Kougetsuan)
I'll not cry until I realize my dream.

210
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,120
Tsubaki-san.

211
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,080
Is there anything I can help with?

212
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,860
I'm fine, thanks.

213
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,500
Shiori-san should go get some rest.

214
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,660
Sorry, Shiori-san.

215
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,280
Can you get the chopsticks for me?

216
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,580
Okay.

217
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:29,820
Here.

218
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,100
Thank you.

219
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,140
(Kougetsuan)
They're done!

220
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:41,140
What is this... Tsubaki-san?

221
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,820
"Empty Moon"

222
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:46,540
(Empty Moon)

223
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,380
Traditionlly,

224
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,860
people did not stare up at the harvest moon.

225
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,860
Rather than looking at the moon directly,

226
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,780
they enjoyed looking its reflection

227
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,380
on lake and other water surfaces.

228
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,320
- Empty Moon?
- The moon and its copy.

229
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,280
The night sky is made of habutai-shigure.

230
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,520
This is amazing! The water ripples are ripping!

231
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,960
Great job, Tsubaki-san!

232
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,600
The judges would love it,

233
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,480
This well be better than Hanagasumi's.

234
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,940
The ripples are so good!

235
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,600
If you can make something like this,

236
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,680
why don't you make more sweets for the shop?

237
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:22,980
Are ripples made of Jonen flour?

238
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,260
Yes, it is.

239
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,900
Thank you for making time for me.

240
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,200
Mizoguchi-sensei.

241
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,580
Only for you, Matron.

242
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:36,660
I heard a rumor that

243
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,340
you'll be one of the judges at Samidare Pavilion.

244
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,620
Please make sure Tsubaki wins.

245
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:50,880
Huh.

246
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,880
I understand.

247
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,940
Personally,

248
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,420
Kougetsuan is an important store for me as well.

249
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,860
(The day of the Selection Ceremony)
We will now commence the selection ceremony.

250
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,680
(Samidare pavilion)
Here is the first selection .

251
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,180
Wow, this must be a shigure!

252
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,360
This is beautiful! Very interesting!

253
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,160
Cherry blossoms...

254
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:36,120
Blooming out of season?

255
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,720
This is our next selection.

256
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,620
This looks very simple.

257
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,580
It is just a dango?

258
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:17,420
What?

259
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:23,680
Wow, the moon is floating in the night sky!

260
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,980
This is exciting. And, is this flower I smell ?

261
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,760
Fragrant olive?

262
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,720
(Bright Moon)

263
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,740
Bright Moon

264
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:34,560
(Bright moon)

265
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,880
A bright moon in the cloudless night sky.

266
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,280
This reflects

267
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,760
my determination.

268
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,020
Who's there?

269
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:52,340
I am the true heir to Kougetsuan.

270
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,780
I will erase Kougetsuan as we know it.

271
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,060
No one can stop me.

272
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,600
Who are you?

273
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:12,300
Sorry, I just need a moment.

274
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,340
Tsubaki... can you not see me?

275
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,900
Tsubaki-san.

276
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:27,960
Shiori-san.

277
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:31,740
Sorry, I couldn't stop worring about
the selection result.

278
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,420
Oh, no, um...

279
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,620
I mean, not that I'm worried about what you made!

280
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:38,000
Let's go back to the store and wait.

281
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,420
Okay.

282
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,160
Tsubaki-san,
We just got a call from Samidare Pavilion.

283
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,480
We won the selection!

284
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:03,180
Congratulations, Tsubaki-san.

285
00:17:03,380 --> 00:17:05,100
I'm glad it turned out well.

286
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,360
Tell me about it.

287
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,980
Now, we can finally face our ancestors.

288
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,960
I never doubted that Empty Moon.

289
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:18,260
Look! Tomioka admitted it was good!

290
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:21,940
Guess HanagasumI wasn't much of a competition.

291
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,680
I had Yuko to look into it for me.

292
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,750
(6. Mizoguchi Shinnosuke)
As I thought, the landlady was running.

293
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,340
(6. Mizoguchi Shinnosuke)
The matron was pulling strings in the back.

294
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,200
Congressman Mizoguchi...

295
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,520
Those two go way back.

296
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:44,000
I just hope my sweets left a good impression.

297
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,360
Don't worry.

298
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:51,340
Nanasakura's sweets are the best in the world.

299
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,680
Everyone remembers yours.

300
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:56,720
Thank you.

301
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,200
So...

302
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:01,720
did you see Tsubaki-kun?

303
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,240
I did not.

304
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:14,720
Did Tsubaki stop making sweets because...

305
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:17,520
Sorry.

306
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,600
his eyesight go bad?

307
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:24,000
Nope, this is not my business anymore.

308
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:28,680
(Ishikawa Medical University Hospital)
My vision

309
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:31,120
is getting more blurry every day.

310
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:35,100
Was this because of the fire?

311
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,480
I suspect some debris fell

312
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,180
and scratched your retina.

313
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,280
We must do a surgery or else

314
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,100
you might go completely blind.

315
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,380
Blind...

316
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,200
How long will the recovery take

317
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,560
before I can resume detailed work?

318
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,720
It could be few months to few years ...

319
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,840
It might not completely heal either.

320
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,640
Takatsuki-san.

321
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:18,060
I can't do the surgery now.

322
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,540
Are you sure you should be up?

323
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:26,880
Huh.

324
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,840
Is this...

325
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,820
part of your curse?

326
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,920
Thank you very much, Mizoguchi-sensei.

327
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:55,460
I'm so glad I could sway the vote for Kougetsuan.

328
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:59,000
They were almost going to go with the other one
that place makes really unique sweets.

329
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,000
That place makes really unique sweets.

330
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,100
I think it was called...

331
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,520
"Hanagasumi".

332
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,420
What is going on?

333
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:11,420
You're being rude to our guest, Tsubaki-san.

334
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,640
Don't worry about it.

335
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,200
We've known each other a long time.

336
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:24,960
Were you pulling strings?!
You didn't have to...

337
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,560
What? You'll win without it?

338
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,740
You heard what he said.

339
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:32,620
They would have gone to the other store.

340
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:36,140
Don't tell me you're going to reject the offer.

341
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:38,800
Do you think you can be naive like that

342
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:43,000
and still protect the Kougetsuan brand?

343
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:45,540
For the sake of this store,

344
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:49,500
I'm prepared to go to hell if I have to.

345
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:55,460
The same way? Aren't you?

346
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,240
The thought of being blood - related to you

347
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,840
makes me sick.

348
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,000
Whoa!

349
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,800
I'm sorry. Are you okey?

350
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:12,680
I'm fine.

351
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,140
I hope the sweets are okay.

352
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:17,820
Oh!

353
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:20,840
Oh, I own a sweets shop myself.

354
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:24,420
It's a small place called Hanagasumi.

355
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,180
I can't stop thinking about it.

356
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,240
(Hanagasumi)
Hanagasumi.

357
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:38,480
Meaning the full - blown cherry blossoms

358
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:43,340
which are Chazy and pale from the distance...

359
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:47,080
So you are a congressman, I see.

360
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:49,500
I apologize for being rude earlier.

361
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,440
This is our boar mochi.

362
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:56,480
(Boar Rice Cake)

363
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:03,180
Mmm! This is great!

364
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,460
I was thinking as I was judging too,

365
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,900
that you make really unique sweets.

366
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,620
Thank you for your compliment.

367
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,880
I want to make sure we're as good as Kougetsuan.

368
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:14,680
Heh.

369
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,900
Can I take a box to go?

370
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:21,420
Of course.

371
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:46,160
What's with these sweets...

372
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,160
They seem familiar...

373
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,440
Huh?

374
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,440
Is the young master

375
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,440
from Kougetsuan checking out his rival?

376
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,380
I've finished packaging it up for you.

377
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:57,280
Sensei.

378
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:02,900
Nao.

379
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,620
Here you go.

380
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,900
Thank you. I'll be back again.

381
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:13,140
Anytime.

382
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:23,320
Nao, why are you here?

383
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,260
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

384
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,700
Would you like it to go?

385
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,100
Nao.

386
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:32,700
I recommend the yokan.
Or the seasonal confectionery.

387
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,620
Why did you call it Hanagasumi?!

388
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,840
And why did you open a shop so close to Kougetsuan?!

389
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,780
I've always wanted to open my own store.

390
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,100
Can't you be happy for me?

391
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,100
That's not what I mean! Why,

392
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,080
on the night of the fire

393
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,760
did you disappear without saying anything?!

394
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,720
Had I waited...

395
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:57,980
would something be different?

396
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,880
You asked me back then
whether everything was a lie.

397
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:03,560
I thought,
"Everything I've done so far has been a lie."

398
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,380
That's right.

399
00:24:11,660 --> 00:24:12,940
It was all a lie.

400
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,180
Can you really blame me?

401
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:18,560
I'll never love someone

402
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,360
who accused my mother of murder.

403
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,220
Who is she?

404
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:28,660
Which one is she...

405
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:36,100
I am Sakura... Tsubaki.

406
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:41,160
And Tsubaki, you also...

407
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,160
I'll wait here for you, Tsubaki!

408
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,000
went and got what was most important to you.

409
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,960
But that belongs to me.

410
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:58,140
Nao.

411
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,540
Can I help you?

412
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,580
Sir?

413
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,080
Takigawa-san.

414
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,340
Why are you here?

415
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,780
She and I run this shop together.

416
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:16,440
She's my life partner.

417
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,040
Both professionally.

418
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,760
And as a woman.

419
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,120
So,

420
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:28,180
I won't let you hurt her.

421
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,080
Sir,

422
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:37,480
please leave if you're not here to buy sweets.

423
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:53,600
Did I go too far?

424
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:04,620
Nao.

425
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:07,300
I'd forgotten.

426
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,400
that once I see her,

427
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,480
my hate for her comes back.

428
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,940
(Kougetsuan)
Guys, take a look at this!

429
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,260
(Hanagasumi, Hanaoka Nanasakura)
Nao-san...

430
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:24,280
You're kidding me! She owns Hanagasumi.

431
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,420
How...

432
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:28,480
I've always had a feeling though.

433
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,760
That girls like her are the scariest.

434
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:32,740
What is going on?

435
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,980
This! This is that Hanagasumi!

436
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,980
Where is Tsubaki?

437
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,220
In the office.

438
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:44,740
Tsubaki-san!

439
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,380
Did you know this?

440
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:50,460
That this woman owned Hanagasumi?

441
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:51,400
Yes.

442
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,560
How dare she do this?

443
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,240
Let's get back to work.

444
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,780
Yes.

445
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,620
I doubt he'll ever be yours.

446
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,400
I bet you've never seen him

447
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:12,720
when Tsubaki-san is truly angry or vulnerable.

448
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:16,160
He's always been kind to you.

449
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,100
The only one he opened up to was Nao-san.

450
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:27,420
You don't stand a chance. Nobady does.

451
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:41,000
What in the world is she planning?

452
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,040
Nao.

453
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,800
Sakura is planning to take over Kougetsuan.

454
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:52,180
18 years ago.

455
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:58,080
She truly believes that
her mother did not kill Father.

456
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,340
Well, it wasn't me.

457
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:05,680
You proved that I was innocent, didn't you?

458
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,120
That's right.
That night...

459
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:15,040
I was shocked I couldn't sleep,

460
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:16,980
And she never left the room once.

461
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,980
I never left the room.

462
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,980
I still remember it clearly.

463
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,600
I'm glad I could get your confirmation.

464
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:28,160
But if it was not Sakura's mother,

465
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,720
then who was it?

466
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:33,580
Are you really going to believe what she say?

467
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,240
Don't tell me.

468
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,240
you still have feelings for her?

469
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,260
She thinks she can take over Kougetsuan?

470
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,100
She is out of her mind!

471
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,340
Darn that girl to hell!

472
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,600
I knew it was you.

473
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:21,640
Are you going blind again?

474
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,980
What do you mean?

475
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:37,900
Shiori-san.

476
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:42,340
How is it going with you and Tsubaki?

477
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,720
How interesting.

478
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,260
I like it so I'll buy one.

479
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,060
Why would you assume that?

480
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,620
I like it a lot.

481
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,300
I doubt I will lose to a place like that.

482
00:29:58,960 --> 00:29:59,560
Oh no.

483
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,320
You don't stand a chance.

484
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,040
Oh no.

485
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:10,120
No, no, no, no, no.

486
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,440
Matron.

487
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:20,560
I think I'm pregnant.

488
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,440
What?

489
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,200
It's Tsubaki-san's child.

490
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:31,580
Shiori-san! That's wonderful!

491
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:35,180
Let's prepare for the wedding right away.

492
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,080
Wedding?

493
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:39,320
Of course! The child will be the next heir!

494
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:44,000
let's go tell Haseya-san right away!

495
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,780
I can't give up.

496
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,080
Not anymore.

497
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,080
Don't tell anyone.

498
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:02,660
But if your eyes are bad,
you should get the surgery now!

499
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,860
Not until after the garden party.

500
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,260
Why?

501
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,680
Who cares about the garden party?

502
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,580
If you go blind like this

503
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:11,440
Who cares?

504
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:13,940
How can you even say that?

505
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:18,100
Lots of local leaders and
celebrities will be there.

506
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:21,560
If i mess up, Kougetsuan's reputation will be destroyed!

507
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:25,500
And my Kougetsuan will die.

508
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:31,380
(That's right.
He wanted Kougetsuan to be loved by all.)

509
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,680
That's the kind of store I'm going to run.

510
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:38,060
I promise you that.

511
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:40,960
(He hasn't changed a bit...)

512
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:45,680
(He's still the Tsubaki I love.)

513
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,620
Even then,

514
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:52,420
I'm not going to give up my plan
to take over Kougetsuan.

515
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,120
I'm going to claim what my mom left me.

516
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:01,460
I'm going to prove her innocence.

517
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,700
And then I'm going to...

518
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:10,280
free Tsubaki-san from the curse of Kougetsuan.

519
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:15,120
This calls for a celebration, and

520
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:20,540
I wish to welcome her
to our family as soon as possible.

521
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:25,060
I know this is too much to ask,

522
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,880
but could you please overlook
what happened in the past?

523
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:31,280
Shiori has already left this house.

524
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:34,320
Do whatever you want.

525
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,080
Shiori.

526
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:40,680
Congratulations.

527
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:43,760
Here are walnuts for you.

528
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:46,980
Eat them to prevent high blood pressure

529
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,280
when you're pregnant.

530
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:52,100
You know, Father told us to get them to you.

531
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,380
He's been excited ever since you called.

532
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:58,300
Secretly, he's over the moon about it.

533
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,060
Come on now.

534
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:02,040
No, no, no.

535
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:07,640
I guess...

536
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,420
bring the child here once he's born.

537
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,580
I'm sure Mom wants to hold him too.

538
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:20,320
Isn't that great, Shiori?

539
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:24,800
Children are really powerful, you know.

540
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,280
They can change everything in an instant.

541
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:32,000
No matter what the circumstances are.

542
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:42,840
You should let others handle
the garden party order.

543
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:46,040
You're about to have your hands full.

544
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,040
What do you mean?

545
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:51,940
I mean you're going to marry Shiori-san!

546
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,260
You're uttering nonsense again.

547
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:57,220
Don't act dumb with me,

548
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:00,940
I heard it first-hand from Shiori-san herself.

549
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:06,180
That's she's pregnant with your child.

550
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,180
Huh?

551
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,180
If you don't take responsibility this time,
I won't forgive you.

552
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:22,320
Looks like your strategy worked, Nao-chan's

553
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,000
Mizoguchi said he wants yo ask you to

554
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:28,460
make the sweets for his next committee meeting.

555
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:31,140
Really? I'll do it!

556
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:36,360
Did something happen? With Tsubaki-kun?

557
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:39,580
Nothing happened.

558
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,880
You're such a terrible liar.

559
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:44,960
Your eyes are red.

560
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,040
If you don't tell me everything,

561
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:49,760
I can't help you.

562
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,480
I see.

563
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:59,500
So to help Tsubaki-kun get the surgery quickly,

564
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,220
you decided to take over Kougetsuan sooner.

565
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:09,020
As long as he's at Kougetsuan,

566
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:12,120
TsubakI will always be stuck there.

567
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:17,420
He can't even dream of another future.

568
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,300
Even though he has talent to make unique sweets.

569
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,980
even though all he wants to do

570
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:30,040
is to make sweets all day.

571
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,060
But he will probaly hate you.

572
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,560
He won't ever forgive you.

573
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,560
Huh....

574
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,800
You're something else.

575
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,500
I'm envious of how much you love him.

576
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,220
Jealous, even...

577
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,260
Stop joking.

578
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,620
I'm not joking.

579
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,380
You're special to me, Nao-san.

580
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:08,140
What?

581
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,340
Takigawa-san.

582
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,760
Your persererance and...

583
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,640
your dedication to sweets making.

584
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,040
is admirable.

585
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,400
No matter what,

586
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,340
I'll always stay by your side.

587
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:41,860
Shiori-san, I'm coming in.

588
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,560
Shiori?

589
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,240
Tsubaki-san.

590
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:01,280
Please sleep with me!

591
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,300
Shiori-san.

592
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:04,640
I'm sorry.

593
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,480
I know.

594
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,320
I know you don't have feelings for me.

595
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,180
But...

596
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,900
Please.

597
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,360
Please give me Tsubaki-san's child.

598
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:23,000
To make this real.

599
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:26,820
I love you.

600
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,640
Since the first day I met you.

601
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,240
So...

602
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:37,020
Please.

603
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:52,340
And?

604
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,380
What do you like about me?

605
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:56,780
What?

606
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,040
What do you know about me?

607
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,360
Tsubaki-san.

608
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,980
I bet you're never seen him.

609
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,800
He's always been kind to you.

610
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,060
Back in the old days,

611
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,200
I would have slept with you without hesitation.

612
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,380
Just as a means to an end, without emotion.

613
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:42,060
But now...

614
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,120
Right now, it's impossible for me.

615
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,440
I don't plan to tell anyone the truth.

616
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,960
You are free to do as you wish here.

617
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,120
(Yuko's Incense shop)
An order from Congressman Mizoguchi?

618
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,480
All thanks to you.

619
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,480
You're awfully invested in this.

620
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:19,880
Don't tell me are you in love with her?

621
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:22,040
It's weird, I know.

622
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:25,640
I thought I liked older women.

623
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:32,220
But are you sure you want Kougetsuan as you enemy?

624
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:36,500
Even though it's 18 years ago.

625
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:39,160
Kyoko is a pretty vindictive woman.

626
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:47,100
Speaking of Kougetsuan,
I heard from my regular customer...

627
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:49,320
What?

628
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,320
What? Grand Master....

629
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:53,340
They say he won't make it to next year.

630
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,060
I can't believe in it.

631
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:58,320
The only one who can choose the successor.

632
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,880
is the Grand Master himself.

633
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,140
Now's the time to come forward.

634
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,320
Oh, Mizoguchi-sensei.

635
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:15,040
What? Hanagasumi?

636
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,040
Oh, the owner...

637
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,960
used to be the young matron at Kougetsuan,
wasn't she?

638
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,360
I thought it was a coincidence.

639
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,540
but looks like she approched me on purpose.

640
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,040
There's chance!

641
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,900
She's looking into our relationship.

642
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:40,700
I can't believe that she'd go that far.

643
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,280
Unless a grandchild with
Takatsuki blood appear,

644
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:49,900
in which case the grandchild
will inherit everything.

645
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:54,760
I have to keep him close...

646
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:03,500
Hello, Father!

647
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:06,560
Let's go home, shall we?

648
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:14,260
Sa... Sakura!

649
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:17,160
Why are you here?

650
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,580
Congressman Mizoguchi

651
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:21,300
ordered our sweets for his committee.

652
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:26,360
If word gets out that a powerful congressman
cut ties with you.

653
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:27,940
What will they say?

654
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:31,740
About Kougetsuan's reliability?

655
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:37,040
Nao-san, our family

656
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:40,100
and the Haseya family will be relatives soon.

657
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:45,340
Shiori-san is pregnant.

658
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:50,160
With Tsubaki's child.

659
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,320
Tsubaki's?

660
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:05,080
Now... get out of my sight!

661
00:42:11,340 --> 00:42:13,640
Let's go, Father.

662
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,420
(To Nao)

663
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:15,920
(To Nao)
But,

664
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:19,520
it doesn't change the fact that
I am the true heir to Kougetsuan!

665
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:23,680
I am Itsuki-san's real daughter!

666
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:36,100
(To Nao)

667
00:42:36,420 --> 00:42:37,460
(Takatsuki)
What are you planning?

668
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,660
You never visited him,
and now you want to care for him at home.

669
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:42,860
I have a heart too, you know.

670
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:46,360
He's our family.

671
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,900
Come on, Father, let's go inside.

672
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,560
Now, now...

673
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,620
If I give up now, Matron will get her way.

674
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:59,480
And I won't achieve my mom's dream.

675
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:03,660
And I won't be able to free Tsubaki at this rate.

676
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:09,260
(Kougetsuan)
This time, I swear I'm going to protect what I love.

677
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,720
I came to speak to Grand Master.

678
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,720
Can I please see him?

679
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,100
Please hold on.

680
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:32,740
Um... Can I ask you one more thing?

681
00:43:33,660 --> 00:43:36,780
Please tell Tsubaki-san
to get his eye surgery done.

682
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:38,400
Eyes?

683
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:41,720
To not wait until the garden party, bu right now.

684
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:44,760
We can't wait until it's too late.

685
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:47,600
If he loses his eyesight...

686
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,340
Sorry, Shiori-san.

687
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:51,740
Can you get the chopsticks for me?

688
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:53,280
Okey.

689
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:55,900
Oh... He won't listen to me!

690
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:57,900
But if it comes from Shiori-san...

691
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:01,560
the person he's going to spend
the rest of his life with,

692
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:03,620
I'm sure he'll listen to you.

693
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:08,560
Please.

694
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:14,200
Please!

695
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:19,040
I can't. I can't do it.

696
00:44:24,280 --> 00:44:25,300
I'm sorry.

697
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:30,520
Please take care of yourself.

698
00:44:41,820 --> 00:44:44,240
Grand Master, I'm coming in.

699
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:55,500
Um...

700
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:56,400
Sakura...

701
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:58,900
Is that you?

702
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:07,880
Are you...really...

703
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:12,340
Itsuki's child...?

704
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:16,400
Yes.

705
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,380
(DNA father and child appraisal information)

706
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:23,480
Here...

707
00:45:25,460 --> 00:45:26,500
No!

708
00:45:30,700 --> 00:45:32,060
My proof...

709
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:35,260
that my mom left me...

710
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:38,560
Give it back!

711
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:41,080
Give it back! Give it back!

712
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:45,600
Father...

713
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:48,780
I didn't know you were awake.

714
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:50,900
Nao.

715
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:55,560
What's with all the noise?

716
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,580
Let me speak to her in private.

717
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:05,520
Why... but why now?

718
00:46:05,580 --> 00:46:07,140
Just leave us alone.

719
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:28,100
I've always wondered

720
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:32,000
if Father's real child is Sakura,

721
00:46:33,380 --> 00:46:34,480
then who is my father?

722
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:38,480
Wait...

723
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:40,660
did he kill Father?

724
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:38,520
This sweet...

725
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:41,180
A girl named Sakura made it.

726
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:42,880
Ho!

727
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:51,600
I had

728
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:54,600
known about it.

729
00:47:56,660 --> 00:48:00,200
That Itsuki had loved someone for a long time.

730
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:04,500
A middle school classmate?

731
00:48:05,180 --> 00:48:07,400
You know you can't marry her!

732
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:09,160
But Father...

733
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:11,660
Don't you care about her future?!

734
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:15,420
Without knowing anything about her,

735
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:19,120
I made them break up.

736
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:24,300
All marriages are to be arranged.

737
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:30,240
Those traditions are still
well and alive in our world.

738
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:37,080
But those two never move on from each other.

739
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:42,780
And she was working as an artisan in our store.

740
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:47,460
I didn't find out until after those two had died.

741
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:49,560
What were they doing?

742
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:52,740
They were kissing.

743
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:55,980
You're a liar!

744
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:58,060
Had I allowed it,

745
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:04,260
both Itsuki... and your mother

746
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:09,540
may have still been living happily with us.

747
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:18,560
As the person who messed everything up,
can you really forgive me?

748
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:26,500
I can't.

749
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:29,400
But...

750
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:37,460
I...

751
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:43,080
I want this store that
my father and mother treasured.

752
00:49:44,820 --> 00:49:45,720
I want to

753
00:49:47,640 --> 00:49:49,040
make sweets here.

754
00:49:56,660 --> 00:50:00,360
(Takatsuki Family)
18 years ago on that day of everything I saw...

755
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:03,980
Did I forget something?

756
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:06,820
Something...

757
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:08,880
Something...

758
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:11,240
Something important...

759
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:15,500
How ironic.

760
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:20,800
You were the only one who came to see me

761
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:22,380
and took care of me when I was in the hospital.

762
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:25,820
I just wanted to see you hunched over.

763
00:50:25,820 --> 00:50:27,820
The successor of Kougetsuan

764
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:30,940
shall be direct blood decedents only.

765
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:35,780
And who has that right?

766
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:39,900
It will be easy to find out right now.

767
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:41,900
But...

768
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:45,820
Is that really the right thing to do?

769
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:50,400
Is that really important right now?

770
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:52,400
Tsubaki.

771
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:55,500
Sakura.

772
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:01,780
On December 31st, New Year's eve,

773
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:04,600
could you both make sweets for me?

774
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:09,920
The one who makes the more delicious,

775
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:16,340
more soul-shattering sweet

776
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:22,420
will be the next successor of Kougetsuan.

777
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:35,500
(Final episode)
I mean, you're hiding it.

778
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:35,680
I mean, you're hiding it.

779
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:36,800
This will be the last time.

780
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:38,400
I will never see Tsubaki again.

781
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,500
Aren't you Tsubaki-san's real father?

782
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:43,040
You and I are accomplices, aren't we?

783
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,240
(Who is the accomplice?)
You and I are accomplices, aren't we?

784
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:44,600
(Who is the accomplice?)
