1
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,880
Maybe I'm drawn to you.

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,280
But if you're Sakura,

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,280
I have to kill this feeling.

4
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:16,250
(Undelusional precepts)

5
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,500
Answer me.

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:20,700
Are you really Hanaoka Nao?

7
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:22,360
Or

8
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,780
Sakura?

9
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:29,860
It was my first love.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
If it were true, it would be a dream come true.

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,840
I'm so happy I could cry.

12
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,660
We are

13
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:45,400
normal.

14
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,740
That was Sakura's mother.

15
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,120
I don't know anything about it.

16
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:55,220
(Dear Nao, I didn't do it.)
I was just making sweets...

17
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,680
(Undelusional precepts)
I've come prepared.

18
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,780
He's ready to go to hell.

19
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,220
My name is Hanaoka Nao.

20
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:16,740
I'm not Sakura.

21
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,360
Do I look so much alike?

22
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,740
I'm with a girl called Sakura.

23
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,860
Sakura hid in the shadows.

24
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,360
She was always so shy.

25
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,400
Like this...

26
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:41,900
She never looked at me straight in the eye.

27
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,740
I like the way you look at me.

28
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,680
Nao, I believe in you.

29
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:58,500
But we don't do this kind of thing anymore...

30
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,780
If you don't like it, you can shake it off.

31
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,640
I want it all to be mine.

32
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,640
That's about it.

33
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,200
I love you now.

34
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,720
Mom, forgive me just for now.

35
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,260
I'm really out of my mind.

36
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,200
What is waiting for me?

37
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,240
Even though there is only hell.

38
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,100
I can't

39
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:38,840
shake it off.

40
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,820
Tsubaki.

41
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:47,180
What's wrong with me?

42
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,780
In the arms of Tsubaki,

43
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,680
I can't believe I'm happy.

44
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,300
(Takaragawa)

45
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,620
Is it morning already?

46
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,220
Yes.

47
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,280
It's been a long time since I slept so well.

48
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,860
That's weird.

49
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:30,560
Honesty,

50
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:33,120
I don't know how to do it well.

51
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,500
But...

52
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,840
I'll take care of it in my own way.

53
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,000
You're lying to me...

54
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,900
It's a fake marriage...

55
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:57,820
(Kougetsu)
This...

56
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,700
Kougetsuan's work clothes.

57
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,720
You're going to be a part of this family.

58
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,460
The uniform my mom used to wear.

59
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,040
Nao-san.

60
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,040
Can you get me four teas at 10 o'clock?

61
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,940
I have a very important guest.

62
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,680
I understand.

63
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,080
What? How dare the landlady bring me out in public?

64
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:51,220
(Hamabe Minami)

65
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,220
(Yohohama Ryusei)

66
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,580
=Cursed in Love=

67
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,160
Please excuse us.

68
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:27,420
This air, she is trying to check me.

69
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:29,020
We have brought you some tea.

70
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,980
Serve it to you.

71
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:32,940
Yes.

72
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,700
Don't worry, I at least know how to serve tea.

73
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:42,840
Thank you.

74
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,240
Please excuse me.

75
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,860
Good, perfect.

76
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,480
Please wait.

77
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,660
Can you stay there in case I still need you?

78
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:54,700
Yes.

79
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,240
Kyoko-san, that kimono
is summer Oshima, isn't it?

80
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,360
Yes.

81
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,540
I prefer weaving.

82
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:08,880
It's beautiful! I don't think I could afford it.

83
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,860
No, no, not at all.

84
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:14,140
Um... Um...

85
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,880
Would you like me to change your tea?

86
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,620
Hey, you...

87
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,380
I'm so sorry.

88
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:25,820
I am very sorry.

89
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:31,760
I'm not sure.

90
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:35,900
You really don't know, do you?

91
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,700
"Would you like me to change your tea?"

92
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:43,040
It means, "It's time for you to go away".

93
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,080
Didn't they tell you that?

94
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,800
To that mother.

95
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,600
I'm sorry.

96
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,120
But my mother had nothing to do with it.

97
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:56,600
Because of one ignorant and stupid comment.

98
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,640
Everything we've built up over the years
can come crashing down in an instant.

99
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:04,000
That's the world we live in!

100
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:08,920
You don't deserve to wear this.

101
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,880
Take off your clothes!

102
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:21,340
If you are not well brought up

103
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:24,580
and you don't even know what this world is.

104
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,760
So, you and Tsubaki-san can be together?

105
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,440
Do you want to get married?

106
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,040
Shallow.

107
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,680
You really have the nerve!

108
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,940
It's not too late.

109
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,940
For Tsubaki,

110
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:47,060
you have to leave as soon as possible!

111
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,220
A different world.

112
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,880
No matter how much passion I have for sweets.

113
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:58,200
I can't help it.

114
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,920
They deny everything about me.

115
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:12,380
Nao-san! You're done for the day.

116
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,640
Jojima-kun.

117
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,540
Could you come with me for a moment?

118
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:23,920
Afternoon tea!

119
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:26,640
I didn't want to come alone.

120
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,460
Come on, let's eat.

121
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,880
Enjoy yourself.

122
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:36,600
Delicious!

123
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,460
And fun!

124
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:40,600
It goes well with alcohol and coffee.

125
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,560
Indeed!

126
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,700
You can put seasonal items here.

127
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,500
For example?

128
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,920
Tanabata-style!

129
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,480
That's a good idea.

130
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:53,640
With Jojima-kun, I can talk purely about wagashi.

131
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,040
It's a real relief.

132
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,200
I knew it was a waste of time
to become a landlady.

133
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:03,780
You can't make sweets
when you are the proprietress of Kougetsuan.

134
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,700
I like it so much.

135
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,140
Jojima-kun is going to take over
your family's shop.

136
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,960
You'll remember me, won't you?

137
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:15,000
A small shop in Noto,
but the taste is the best in Ishikawa!

138
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,440
No, it's the best in the country.

139
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,440
The warabi is a speciality.

140
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,280
It's plump and flaky.

141
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:24,500
Plump and flaky?

142
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,780
I want to eat!

143
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,100
Would you like to come and eat?

144
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:29,660
In my room.

145
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:30,800
What?

146
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,020
It was just sent to me from my parents' house.

147
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,020
Jojima-kun's room?

148
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:38,820
Oh, I don't think Nao-san knows.

149
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:41,760
The employees' rooms are separated.

150
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,920
It's the farthest corner room.

151
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,000
That room...

152
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,780
I don't know what I'm talking about.

153
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:56,100
"In the room." I'm sorry.

154
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,220
Are you sure?

155
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:01,060
Can I go?

156
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,920
Well... I'll wait for you tonight.

157
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:16,980
(Takatsuki)

158
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,240
(Takatsuki)
Excuse me.

159
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,280
Time for your medication.

160
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:26,400
Are you all right?

161
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,420
Don't get the wrong idea.

162
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:35,400
I don't recognize you as my successor.

163
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:41,380
That boy... that boy.

164
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,300
Find me quickly.

165
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,900
I've always wanted to go back.

166
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:59,880
But I can't remember where it was.

167
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:16,740
Definitely.

168
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,300
This is the room.

169
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:34,620
Nao.

170
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,260
Are you looking for Nao?

171
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:53,120
I'm sorry, I left the window open.

172
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:57,060
I'll close it then.

173
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,860
The window,

174
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,460
it's not set up properly
and needs to be floated once.

175
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,480
It won't close.

176
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,720
How did you know?

177
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,920
My room was the same as yours.

178
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:11,280
I thought the main house was in order.

179
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,880
Oh, no, I've got to be careful.

180
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,480
Oh, this flower...

181
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,520
Gardenias, right?

182
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,800
Yes, gardenias.

183
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,420
Because the fruit does not
split spontaneously when ripe.

184
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,380
The name of the gardenia is "no mouth".

185
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:30,080
You know a lot about it.

186
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,480
My mother likes it.

187
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,980
As the seasons change,

188
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:39,740
I would give my father
ideas for sweets with those flowers.

189
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,720
I see.

190
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,160
That's my dream, too.

191
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,020
We thought about it a lot as a couple.

192
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,320
We want to make sure that
every single customer has a smile on their face.

193
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:59,560
It's small, but the warmth is second to none.

194
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:03,280
I think that dream is very good.

195
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,560
I want it to happen.

196
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,840
He has that "me too" look on his face.

197
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,040
What?

198
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,120
But,

199
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,160
Tsubaki-san is different, isn't he?

200
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:20,560
♪Happy to win, Hanaichimonme.♪

201
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:26,560
♪It's a shame to lose, Hanaichimonme.♪

202
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:32,580
♪The lady next door, come here for a minute.♪

203
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:38,140
♪I'm too scared of the demons to go.♪

204
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:47,480
I overheard Tsubaki-san saying goodbye before.

205
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:52,400
"What's in it for you? I said."

206
00:13:57,060 --> 00:14:00,940
You can't be happy with Tsubaki-san.

207
00:14:02,080 --> 00:14:05,880
I know, that is the one.

208
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,900
Why not with me?

209
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,900
♪I want her.♪

210
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:15,600

00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:21,180
♪I want this girl I want this girl I don't know.♪

212
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,040
Tsubaki-san...

213
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,260
If you've got time to mess with
other people's stuff,

214
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,260
why don't you practice your incrustation?

215
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,920
Sorry, I...

216
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,680
I like Nao-san.

217
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,040
Tsubaki!

218
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,240
Come on.

219
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:57,040
What do you like about her? That normal girl.

220
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,740
Hey!

221
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,640
Why did you go to that room?

222
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,260
Tsubaki-san, why did you do that to Jojima-kun?

223
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,400
I'm pissed off. I don't have a choice.

224
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,180
It's not true that Jojima likes me...

225
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,180
If that were the case, it would be even worse.

226
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,120
Stay away from him.

227
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:28,500
Jojima-kun.

228
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,320
You shouldn't talk to me.

229
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,480
He's going to be angry with me again.

230
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,920
But it's my job to wash the dishes.

231
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,120
Jojima-kun needs to prepare the red beans.

232
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:38,940
It's okay.

233
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,600
I'm quitting at the end of next month.

234
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:43,600
Eh?

235
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:50,000
Tsubaki-san! Why is Jojima-kun being sacked?

236
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,880
Please don't do that.

237
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,120
Fired?

238
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,380
I can't believe you made him quit.

239
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,450
(Hanaoka Nao's mother is a killer.)
I'm sorry, but can you quit my shop?

240
00:15:58,450 --> 00:16:00,340
I'm sorry, but can you quit my shop?

241
00:16:02,140 --> 00:16:03,100
Please.

242
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,040
You're very desperate.

243
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,740
Jojima has a dream to take over his parents' shop.

244
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,560
Then it's better to give up early.

245
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,880
He still can't even cook red beans properly.

246
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,420
He has no taste.

247
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,100
So now...

248
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,360
Kougetsuan is not the place to talk about dreams!

249
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,820
We don't want people who don't benefit the shop.

250
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:24,520
I heard Tsubaki-san talking about
leaving you before.

251
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,260
"What's in it for the shop?"

252
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,260
This is it!

253
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,160
It's too early for me.

254
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:51,460
Again... Tsubaki-san is far away.

255
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,800
You've done a great job.

256
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,420
Just so you know, I'm only here for one thing.

257
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,700
It's about destroying your son.

258
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,620
He's not going to be crushed easily.

259
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,500
Well, you can do what you like.

260
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:22,780
But...

261
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:27,180
You have to stop them getting married, I swear!

262
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,260
If that's what it takes,

263
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,880
you don't care if your son gets hurt.

264
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,700
You're really scary.

265
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:41,380
Oh, the smell of red beans cooking.

266
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:46,940
I...don't like this smell.

267
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,380
Tsubaki and Nao...

268
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,820
They've been having a row about you.

269
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,240
Really?

270
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,240
What do you mean?

271
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,340
He said he wanted to
take over his family's business.

272
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,260
The shop didn't go under a year ago, did it?

273
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,400
No, Yamaguchi-san.

274
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,200
It didn't go under.

275
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,520
I was crushed. By that man.

276
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:27,860
Shimaya was a small shop run by my parents.

277
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,880
They rarely came to visit us
on school visits or for sports days.

278
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,840
So I

279
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,840
hated Japanese sweets.

280
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:41,780
But...

281
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:47,820
My dad who doesn't even drink or smoke.

282
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:53,580
Every day, he cook the bean paste
and knead the warabi mochi.

283
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:56,020
If I see his back...

284
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,820
He wanted me to take over and protect it.

285
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,020
I thought so.

286
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,050
Jojima.

287
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,960
If you need help...

288
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,560
Sorry. I'll go up first.

289
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,940
I'm coming.

290
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:25,260
I'm not going to run away, i'm going to pay you.

291
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:33,280
No, as expected of Kougetsuan.

292
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,520
The tea is also exceptionally good.

293
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,960
We are honoured to have satisfied Takigawa-san.

294
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,800
Ah, Tsubaki-san, where's the young mistress?

295
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,460
Sorry, she's been a bit busy.

296
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:47,280
I would have liked to have met her.

297
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,060
I heard today is all about work.

298
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:52,140
That's right.

299
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,780
I'd like to introduce you to Matsubara-san
from Otowa Department Store.

300
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,900
Nice to meet you, I'm Matsubara.

301
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:03,240
In fact, we are going to hold a
"Tanabata Japanese Sweets Fair" at our company.

302
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,540
We would love to have Kougetsuan join us.

303
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,780
Takigawa-san was kind enough to introduce us.

304
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:08,240
(Tanabata Japanese Sweet Fair)

305
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,000
(Tanabata Japanese Sweet Fair)
A "Tanabata Fair"?

306
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,760
Yes. From among the sweets of each shop.

307
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:16,660
Customers are invited to vote
for their favourite seets.

308
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,760
The sweets that win first place
will be sold in shops all over the country.

309
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:23,080
Kougetsuan participated in the event

310
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,440
held by Yotsukoshi the year before last.

311
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,050
(Takatsuki Tsubaki)
I am a big fan of Tsubaki's sweets.

312
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:29,020
(Scissors chrysanthemum)
I am a big fan of Tsubaki's sweets.

313
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:29,240
(Prince of the Japanese sweets world)

314
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,450
(Prince of the Japanese sweets world)
"The young incoming head of Kougetsuan...

315
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,200
Prince of the Wagashi world"?

316
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,880
This is just the media's own take on it.

317
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,420
No, I remember, it was a
magnificent "scissors chrysanthemum".

318
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,940
But actually I...

319
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:42,080
I was recommending
another restaurant at the time.

320
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,080
What kind of shop is it?

321
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:47,480
It's a small shop in Noto, but I think...

322
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:49,440
"Shimaya".

323
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,180
It's not enough at all.

324
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,140
That's all I can do at the moment.

325
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,920
You owe me money and you don't know it.

326
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:03,700
Can I go to my mother or...?

327
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,240
"Shimaya".

328
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,140
How did you become
a Japanese sweets maker, Jojima?

329
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,660
My family owns a Japanese sweets shop.

330
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:14,500
"Shimaya" is a small shop in Noto.

331
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,700
But the other day,

332
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:20,060
there was people want to buy the building
and the land of the shop.

333
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,580
I've been known about it.

334
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,580
That's...

335
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,580
It seems to have gone bust.

336
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,160
Say something, damn it!

337
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,140
Shit!

338
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,680
What are you doing to our precious craftsmen?

339
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:38,420
Oh, come on. I just want the money I lent you back.

340
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:40,520
His shop's debts.

341
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:41,800
What?

342
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,380
I'll be in touch.

343
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,800
Joshima-kun, is it about
your shop is your parents' house?

344
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,400
How did you get into debt? What happened to you?

345
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,480
Actually, my father is sick now.

346
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:06,160
Actually, my father is ill at the moment.

347
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,380
So I wasn't in a position to open the shop.

348
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,400
Sick?

349
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,060
Then Jojima-kun will go back
to your parents' house...

350
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,080
It's useless.

351
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:16,620
If you can't serve your famous warabi mochi,
you can't attract customers.

352
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,340
Only my father could have made that.

353
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:22,740
Oh, yes.

354
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,060
I'm sorry I lied about "the warabi mochi in the room".

355
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:30,220
I needed an excuse to ask Nao-san

356
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,380
Jojima's hiding something.

357
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:40,600
But the dream that Jojima-kun told me about...

358
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,940
Small but warm and welcoming, second to none.

359
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:50,420
I'm sure that's what you really think.

360
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,240
Because I can't do it any more.

361
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:59,740
I definitely don't want you to give up, Jojima-kun

362
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:11,820
(Kougetsuan)

363
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:17,480
This sound.

364
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:29,140
Oh, Jojima-kun, just what I needed.

365
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,060
Eh?

366
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,940
Can I ask you to eat this warabi mochi?

367
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,320
I've made it my own.

368
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,960
I was wondering if you could tell me
how it differs from your father's.

369
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,540
What do you think?

370
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:56,920
Totally different.

371
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,520
My father's warabi mochi.

372
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:02,220
It is soft, yet firm and elastic.

373
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,880
When lifted with a toothpick, it stretches well.

374
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,460
But it never runs out.

375
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,400
Soft but resilient...

376
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:15,320
It can be softened by
adding more water to the flour...

377
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,300
Are you serious?

378
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,400
I'll help you.

379
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,100
Oh, I'm fine.

380
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,520
Sorry.

381
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:34,340
Hurry up and go down.

382
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,460
I can't let myself be
pushed around like this by him.

383
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,480
(We make Japanese sweets that are loved by the townspeople)
It's the family home of Yusuke Jojima.

384
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,840
What "Shimaya" is.

385
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,020
I see.

386
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,540
His mother is now in hospital.

387
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,020
(Hakui Central Hospital)

388
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,300
Sorry.

389
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,640
Are you Akiko Jojima?

390
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:17,180
This... Tsubaki-san from Kougetsuan.

391
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,160
Did Yusuke... did my son do something?

392
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:23,200
I'm sorry! I told him to forget about the shop.

393
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:25,420
He said that resentment
would not bring him back.

394
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:26,960
"Resentment"?

395
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,640
"Shimaya" is a...

396
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,880
We've been running on the edge for a long time.

397
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:39,900
We were in debt and wondering
whether we could continue.

398
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,460
We got a big job for us...

399
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,580
Event at Yotsukoshi Department Store.

400
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,280
If we can make the most sales there,

401
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,160
they'll have the goods all year round.

402
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:56,200
I'll bring out the warabi mochi, that'll do!

403
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,300
Yeah!

404
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,280
I'll get Yusuke to help you.

405
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,640
It's been a long time
since I've seen my husband smile

406
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,640
and I'm determined to give it my all.

407
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:06,580
(Kanazawa Japanese Sweets Festival)
Yusuke and I both worke very hard to prepare for it.

408
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,380
But...

409
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:12,440
What's going on here?

410
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:15,120
I'm sorry, I was called back by the attendant.

411
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,220
Why didn't I load it properly?

412
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:19,220
I'm loaded!

413
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,880
It can't just fall over naturally.

414
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,380
One right?

415
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,880
Yes, please.

416
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,800
The 'scissors chrysanthemum' at
Kougetsuan is so beautiful!

417
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,700
(Shimaya's Store)
It was made by a teenage artisan, I swear!

418
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,900
Really?

419
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,100
Please! Please!

420
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,840
Give me another chance, please,
to eat a warabi mochi.

421
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,100
If I could only get that... Ah!

422
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:41,860
Yusuke!

423
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,340
It's noisy.

424
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,820
Serve the best when you can eat it.

425
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,540
Because I can't even do that obvious thing.

426
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,800
You can't be first class.

427
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:58,080
Darn it!

428
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:02,720
Who is it? Who would do something like that?

429
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,620
(Kougetsu)

430
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:13,260
(Kougetsu)
He's such a handsome guy, he's a godsend.

431
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:15,660
He's such a handsome guy, he's a godsend.

432
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,560
(Kougetsuan)
No, not at all.

433
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,260
What's the point of
'scissors chrysanthemum'?

434
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,000
Yes.

435
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:26,760
It took a lot of nerve to create
these delicate petals!

436
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,020
I can't even pay back the money anymore.

437
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:36,580
My husband is exhausted,
both physically and mentally...

438
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:41,140
One morning he collapsed
in the kitchen and stayed there.

439
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,040
That boy...

440
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,880
I think he was broken then.

441
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,020
Please!

442
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,500
Please kick the girl from the shop.

443
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,700
Before you do anything else!

444
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,060
I want her to make pastries purely for me.

445
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,260
Please! Please, please!

446
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,840
Just desperate eyes.

447
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:09,080
Is there such a thing as a mother
who makes this face for her child?

448
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,960
Why are you here?

449
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:16,660
Excuse me.

450
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,760
Hey!

451
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,740
Shimaya's warabi mochi are

452
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:32,240
softness even when chilled.

453
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,520
The flour is made from real bracken flour and

454
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,880
I believe they used lotus powder as a binder.

455
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:41,760
The amount of water is increased to the limit,|nand kneading is the key.

456
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:46,360
To make it sticky, stir in a circular motion.

457
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,400
The elasticity has been increased
but the softness has been lost.

458
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,780
I see.

459
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,020
Was it too much firepower?

460
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,500
Nao-san,

461
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,380
you haven't slept much, have you?

462
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,080
That's enough. Just give up.

463
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:10,900
It's okay.

464
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,900
I'll try a bit harder.

465
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,140
I know. It's my ego.

466
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:21,800
I'm selfishly projecting myself onto Jojima-kun.

467
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:27,220
But I want Jojima-kun to make his dream come true.

468
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:31,200
You've done well.

469
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:37,280
It's still going on and
has nothing to do with the shop.

470
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:40,880
I hear they're plump and toasty!

471
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:42,960
Jojima.

472
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:44,240
Yes.

473
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,960
The red bean paste is not uniform.

474
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,340
You can't make like this, you have to practice.

475
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,140
Sorry.

476
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,520
Jojima-kun.

477
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,000
Sorry, can I get you to eat again?

478
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,460
How long are you going to do this?

479
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,740
I've had enough...

480
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,340
How is it? How soft is it?

481
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,080
It's close, as close as you can get.

482
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,040
I mean, it's almost...

483
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,040
Does that mean it's not as smooth as it could be?

484
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,780
I think I turned the heat down
just a little bit too fast.

485
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:34,600
Why?

486
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,540
I've tried to recreate it many times.

487
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:40,260
But...

488
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,760
The trick is to get the heat right.

489
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,260
Thanks to your detailed memory, Jojima.

490
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:48,380
This warabi mochi is finished

491
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,380
and your father will be fine.

492
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:53,640
If I open another shop,
I will one day fulfil my dream...

493
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,120
Can you please stop?

494
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,820
You can't be serious,
you want to make your dreams come true.

495
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,600
A small but cozy shop?

496
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,500
Isn't that your dream, Nao-san?

497
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,460
Don't put this on me.

498
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:19,800
That's right.

499
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,980
I knew you'd say that.

500
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,720
I brought a change of clothes.

501
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:33,720
A letter?

502
00:31:34,940 --> 00:31:36,320
I owed you money.

503
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,320
It's all been paid back.

504
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:42,180
Huh? What are you talking about?

505
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:44,180
(Loan repayment completion notice)

506
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,490
(Loan repayment completion notice)
No way.

507
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:47,660
Who's that?

508
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,860
What are you imitating?

509
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:59,020
I don't need you to do this to me.

510
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,500
I don't mean to be charitable either.

511
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:03,780
It is a reward.

512
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:08,120
The bracken cake is sold
at the Otowa Department Store.

513
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:10,980
If you put it out, it will sell.

514
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:13,520
I'll give the proceeds to you, the rightful owner.

515
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:14,680
I just paid in advance.

516
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:16,460
He'd get it out. It's not even finished.

517
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:17,360
For now.

518
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:19,720
But Nao will make it.

519
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:23,320
Two years ago at the Yonkoshi event,

520
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:27,440
afterwards, we ate some sample
warabi-mochi from Shimaya.

521
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,280
Eh?

522
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:33,400
I'm jealous, it was a gem, that's all I remember.

523
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,340
How can you say that?

524
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,040
After what he did.

525
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:45,840
I'm not taking your money anyway.

526
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:49,640
Would you be the landlady's dog for money?

527
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:56,200
You're the one who should tell Nao.

528
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,240
Shimaya had long since gone out of business.

529
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,140
It doesn't matter what they do.

530
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:06,300
They don't want to hurt you, that's obvious.

531
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:25,120
What is it?
What is this event at Otowa Department Store?

532
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,500
I'm going to go and have a look around.

533
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:30,040
If you want to come, just follow me.

534
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,340
What do you mean?

535
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:37,220
The sweets for
the Tanabata event are from Kogetsuan.

536
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,500
I can't believe she made that...

537
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,780
What?

538
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:43,500
It was Tsubaki-san who decided.

539
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:58,340
(Otowa Department Store-Tanabata fair now being held)

540
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,280
Wow.

541
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:04,080
The famous Tanabata event
at Otowa Department Store.

542
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:06,280
Even the rooftops are covered in Tanabata.

543
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:08,080
I've never been here before either.

544
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,860
I've heard that customers always stop here too.

545
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,340
I wanted to see it.

546
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,140
A wish?

547
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:21,680
"I want to know what happened," and then...

548
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,820
If you want to do it, believe in it and do it.

549
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:25,880
Eh?

550
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:29,580
We cook up any kind of bean paste
if we think it is good.

551
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,160
They can go towards me and the Grand Master.

552
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,380
I've made up my mind.

553
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:39,520
No matter how difficult it is, we will do it.

554
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:45,480
That's the kind of woman I'm in love with.

555
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,880
Believe in it, and you'll get it.

556
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:53,800
That Tsubaki would give me the words I wanted.

557
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:03,640
After all, let's make up that warabi mochi.

558
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:07,580
(Kougetsuan)

559
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:19,460
Jojima-kun,

560
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:23,160
I'd like to ask you again.

561
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,180
Smooth as if you were eating water.

562
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,980
But it is also resilient and flavourful.

563
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:54,260
That is warabi mochi.

564
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,100
You're kneading, and one moment
you suddenly feel something different.

565
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,760
I think that moment is
the heart of the warabi mochi.

566
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:05,800
Plump... Troglodyte.

567
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,520
All right, let's get this thing ready.

568
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,280
Yes!

569
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:13,600
-Sugita, get the boiling water ready.
-The ratio is 1 part bracken powder to 4 parts cold water.

570
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,460
Please.

571
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,460
Tsubaki-san. Abe-san?

572
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,260
Abe-san, wash your hands.

573
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:18,140
Yes!

574
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:21,660
Jojima, you're late! You help over here.

575
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:23,080
Yes!

576
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,020
(Haseya Inn)

577
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:28,750
(Tanabata Japanese Sweets Fair)

578
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:31,580
(Kougetsuan)
The Tanabata Fair at Otowa Department Store?

579
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,380
Let's go tomorrow, the three of us.

580
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,660
Yes!

581
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:38,880
Leave the bookmark tomorrow,
I'll get you a new kimono.

582
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:42,600
Ah, father.

583
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,440
But I, tomorrow...

584
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,580
I've got an arranged marriage.

585
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,960
Are you sure?

586
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,720
Away from Kanazawa, but...

587
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,700
Or the girl who was abandoned
by the groom on her wedding day,

588
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:53,960
and you should be grateful

589
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,820
that he's saying that.

590
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:57,600
Yes.

591
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:02,760
Mother, what's your partner like?

592
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:05,280
He's the son of a famous
Komatsu family, the Kakukura.

593
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,040
It's a fine house.

594
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:13,340
All we have to do now is
bring it in tomorrow. That's it.

595
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:13,980
Yes.

596
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,840
We look forward to working with you.

597
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,060
Yes!

598
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:19,600
Tanabata is coming soon.

599
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,060
Right now, I just want to tell
as many people as possible.

600
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,340
I want them to try this watabi mochi.

601
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,620
What? How did this happen?

602
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:01,400
Sugita, go to call Tsubaki-san!

603
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,400
Yes! Excuse me.

604
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,540
Oh, the event starts in three hours.

605
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:08,880
We have to bring it in now.

606
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,140
We'll never make it in time.

607
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:12,500
Don't worry, ladies and gentlemen.

608
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:14,260
Tanabata sweets are

609
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,940
prepared well.

610
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,000
That so bad, Nao-san!

611
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:25,180
You can't keep track of what you've made.

612
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,540
This woman is...

613
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,500
She's ruined my sweets twice.

614
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,340
Why?

615
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:46,560
Why is it that the person like you

616
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:48,560
is the landlady of this shop?

617
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,240
Are you Tsubaki's mother?

618
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,980
What's this all about?

619
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:55,560
Tsubaki-san.

620
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:58,000
It's a lack of control on Nao-san's part.

621
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:01,900
It's all about making
until you serve it to the customer.

622
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:04,740
But don't worry.

623
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:08,360
Tomioka-san to make sweets for Tanabata...

624
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,820
I asked him.

625
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:14,360
The sweets in the shape of bamboo grass.

626
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:18,780
Beside that,

627
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,780
monaka in star shape.

628
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,140
It's enough to win.

629
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:28,220
There is no way.

630
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:30,600
I'll bring you something.

631
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:32,600
Yes.

632
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:43,060
Wait for it!

633
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:46,680
What ruined that warabi mochi...

634
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,160
It can't be.

635
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,820
Because someone is useless.

636
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,380
It's a lot of extra work.

637
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:20,400
You're not going to the event?

638
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:22,460
I'll be there when
I've finished cleaning this up.

639
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,240
I have to make some warabi mochi for them.

640
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:30,180
How do you get people to eat?

641
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,140
This one.

642

(Tanabata Japanese Sweets Fair)

643
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,160
It's a great success.

644
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:49,360
With the help of Mr. Takigawa.

645
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:52,080
Thanks to the many famous shops
that have opened their doors to us.

646
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,460
This is a new product for Tanabata.

647
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:59,520
Our craftsmen have worked
very hard for this occasion.

648
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:03,700
These are our signature sweets, how about you?

649
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,700
Are these star-shaped monaka?

650
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,480
Yes, that's right.

651
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:10,340
Would you like to try a sample?

652
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:11,940
You...

653
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,320
What are you doing here?

654
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:19,020
I came to invite people eat my warabi mochi.

655
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:20,900
The landlady.

656
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,780
What are you talking about?

657
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:26,000
These are the monaka made by Tomioka-san.

658
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,780
We are very proud of our...

659
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:29,780
Ha!

660
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:32,820
Warabimochi looks delicious!

661
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:35,220
Wha... why?

662
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:37,560
Serve with a sprinkling of soybean flour.

663
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:41,820
It's a deep roast and
goes very well with this warabi mochi.

664
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:44,380
Enjoy yourself.

665
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:50,160
Delicious trotters!

666
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,920
Please give me three of these.

667
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:55,220
Thank you. Three, please.

668
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,360
It's a warabi mochi in a monaka

669
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,020
Sorry, tasting...

670
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:26,720
Dad!

671
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,500
You knew that too, didn't you?

672
00:42:35,500 --> 00:42:38,880
There's no way Nao-san could have prepared
that much on her own.

673
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,880
I'm just giving you some advice.

674
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:44,920
This warabi mochi tastes good, but

675
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:47,500
We need a little more than that for our events.

676
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:50,020
Besides,

677
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,600
there are poisonous butterflies in this shop.

678
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,180
Tomioka-san made only one kind of sweet.

679
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:03,220
Nao-san came up with the idea of
the monaka to protect the warabi mochi.

680
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,320
If you're the kind of person
who makes sure you get what you ask for.

681
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,320
We would not have been outwitted.

682
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:12,700
I've prepared it as you asked.

683
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,760
Yes, thank you.

684
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:20,000
But the warabi mochi was scattered
all over the floor...

685
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,660
You're the proprietress of a
Japanese sweets shop and you didn't notice?

686
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:25,560
That warabi mochi was old and hard.

687
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:29,660
I used a dummy of
what Nao-san has failed to do so far.

688
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:32,640
The real thing...

689
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:36,260
You carried it with your own hands.

690
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:39,700
Two years ago.

691
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:42,740
The one that ruined Shimaya's warabi mochi.

692
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:45,060
It's you.

693
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:51,080
And you won, didn't you?

694
00:43:53,980 --> 00:43:55,700
I really feel sorry for him.

695
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:02,280
But you can't push me away.

696
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:05,200
Isn't it?

697
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:13,840
Long time no see!

698
00:44:16,340 --> 00:44:17,260
Today's child.

699
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:22,300
That young landlady is doing her best.

700
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:25,040
But rumour has it that

701
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:28,020
the landlady doesn't approve of it.

702
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,500
The next head of Kougetsuan,

703
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:36,020
it is natural to want to marry the right person.

704
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:38,020
Is that really all there is to it?

705
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:41,160
Why you want to get rid of her.

706
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:44,760
When you two get married...

707
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:48,040
Is there something inconvenient about it?

708
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:49,740
What do you mean...

709
00:44:49,740 --> 00:44:50,660
From now on,

710
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:53,320
I'll be in the shop often.

711
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:00,100
(Today' sale is over)

712
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:00,780
(Today' sale is over)
Thank you for your hard work.

713
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:01,320
Thank you for your hard work.

714
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:04,160
The tally is not yet available.

715
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:07,540
I think Kougetsuan's warabi mochi
will get the most votes.

716
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:08,520
Are you sure?

717
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:10,940
So I want to name the product.

718
00:45:11,380 --> 00:45:12,900
"Shimaya", please.

719
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:14,940
Shimaya?

720
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:23,300
This is the name of the shop
that created the warabi mochi.

721
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:29,280
I understand. Can we have a meeting?

722
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:37,280
Yes, you can.

723
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,920
I gave up trying to make it.

724
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:46,900
I've done my best, I've done all I can do.

725
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:48,720
That's how I justify myself.

726
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:51,040
I was running away from hating people.

727
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:54,680
But Nao-san.

728
00:45:57,580 --> 00:45:59,440
How can you do so much for us?

729
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,200
The shop and my dad.

730
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:06,420
I lied to you.

731
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,980
Oh, I see.

732
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:13,500
I've made so many mistakes.

733
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:16,060
I've heard that straw flour in summer
is very precious.

734
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:18,100
You have to make it work.

735
00:46:18,100 --> 00:46:21,940
I've been thinking about warabi mochi ever since.

736
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,540
What is it? That.

737
00:46:28,450 --> 00:46:30,800
You're such an idiot.

738
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:34,480
Now we have to clean up.

739
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:39,560
I'd like you to come to our head office
in Tokyo soon.

740
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:41,720
We would be delighted to consider you for a stall.

741
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:08,400
I'll pay you back, just give me time.

742
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:12,080
That's the money I bought the warabi mochi with.

743
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:13,760
You don't have to give it back.

744
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:14,540
But

745
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:16,980
that warabi mochi is from Shimaya.

746
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:21,820
One day I'll make it mine.

747
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:25,080
Good morning.

748
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:26,700
Good morning.

749
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:29,200
Jojima-kun.

750
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:32,960
Apparently he'll be working here for a while.

751
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:36,080
Really? I'm glad.

752
00:47:39,820 --> 00:47:41,380
So don't show too much of an opening.

753
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:44,760
It's nothing.

754
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:50,320
When Tanabata is over,

755
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:54,280
we went about our wedding preparations.

756
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:58,540
We're Shirafujiya.

757
00:48:00,380 --> 00:48:01,800
Nao-san, stay still.

758
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:02,500
Yes.

759
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:06,240
Well, that's nice!

760
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:11,360
What should we do about the accessories?

761
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:15,160
Kaiken, Suehiro, Hakosako.

762
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:17,400
There are many different designs.

763
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:19,400
If you don't want to change your colour,

764
00:48:19,620 --> 00:48:21,560
why don't you make it red?

765
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:25,580
What? The colour red symbolizes blood.

766
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:30,280
It means to be reborn as a married man.

767
00:48:30,680 --> 00:48:31,480
Red...

768
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:38,480
I prefer white.

769
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,540
Please make everything white.

770
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:45,540
Are you OK?

771
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:48,740
Excuse me. What is it?　Suddenly.

772
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:52,780
Nao-san, could it be...?

773
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:54,960
Congratulations?

774
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:57,760
Eh?

775
00:48:58,760 --> 00:48:59,680
(Ishigawa Prefecture - Komatsu city)
Welcome.

776
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:04,600
This is too much for my daughter to bear.

777
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:06,060
Thank you very much.

778
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:08,420
It's been a tough time for Haseya-san.

779
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:10,420
But Shiori-san.

780
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:13,620
It was a good thing I didn't marry into Kougetsuan.

781
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:19,280
Actually, there's a rumor going around here.

782
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:23,000
The young landlady who came in place of Shiori.

783
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:25,200
The daughter of a murderer.

784
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:34,180
Could it be congratulations?

785
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,320
No, sir.

786
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:41,320
I was just a bit tired.

787
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:45,280
But if that's really the case...

788
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:54,480
The wedding invitations are ready.

789
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:58,760
Nao?

790
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,560
It's true, there are so many.

791
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:08,160
Oh, and by the way,
are we only supposed to invite the mother?

792
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,880
My mother...

793
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,880
(Yuko's Incense shop)
I can't stop them coming as guests.

794
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,680
You mean Yuko-san?

795
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:17,820
Yes, I know.

796
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:19,660
Right.

797
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:35,120
I don't have a name card.

798
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:39,560
Yuko, one hot chocolate.

799
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:40,400
Yes.

800
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:42,780
Welcome...

801
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:55,060
Can I have a cold glass of sake?

802
00:50:56,860 --> 00:51:02,200
It's... it's hot today.

803
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:08,300
She's the daughter of a murderer?

804
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:21,960
I don't know...

805
00:51:24,380 --> 00:51:25,330
(Preview)
I like you.

806

(Preview)
I don't want to hear you lie.

807
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:27,500
That's really fine.

808
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:29,500
You won't regret?

809
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:32,820
Do you know Nao-san's mother was a murderer?

810
00:51:32,820 --> 00:51:34,660
I don't like it.

811
