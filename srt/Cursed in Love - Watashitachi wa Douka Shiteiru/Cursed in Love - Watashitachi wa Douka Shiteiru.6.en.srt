1
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:07,980
(DNA Test Report)
The master's real child...

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,760
is not Tsubaki

3
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:14,880
but me.

4
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:18,700
No way.

5
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,740
I love you, Nao.

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:24,360
I can't hide my pregnancy,
but I can't let my real identity be revealed.

7
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,560
I have to find the truth before then.

8
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:29,460
That door is only opened on a special occasion.

9
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,460
The day of The Twilight Tea Ceremony.

10
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:32,660
My last will...

11
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,580
In case a grandchild
with Takatsuki blood appears,

12
00:00:36,580 --> 00:00:39,500
I shall inherit all the property.

13
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:41,500
What is that?

14
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,080
Only Tsubaki shall take over Kougetsuan!

15
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:46,440
Let's get started.

16
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:47,640
Okay.

17
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,920
In this sweltering heat,

18
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,640
(Kougetsuan)
The Grand Master's tea ceremony.

19
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,580
(The Day of The Twilight Tea Ceremony)

20
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:53,860
(The Day of The Twilight Tea Ceremony)
It about to begin.

21
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,360
Osugi, sake, quickly! Slowly, quickly!

22
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,080
Slowly and quickly?

23
00:00:58,140 --> 00:00:58,620
Carefully and quickly.

24
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,620
Get the cups too!

25
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:01,240
Yes.

26
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,680
It's quite a big event, isn't it?

27
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,920
In the Twilight Tea Ceremony,
the guests are seated at sunset.

28
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,920
And entertained from twilight...

29
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,260
It is a tea ceremony
to enjoy the light of the night.

30
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:13,300
Please don't be rude to our guests.

31
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:14,020
Yes.

32
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,440
Is this the Moonflower?

33
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:20,940
Yeah. I put yellow paste inside.

34
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:22,560
When it's getting dark,

35
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,160
yellow is the color which catch your eyes.

36
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,160
(Moonflower)

37
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:30,460
In the night,
looking at the moonflower,

38
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,960
I hope it'll remind you of
the full moon above the night sky.

39
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,680
Moonflower and the moon...

40
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,840
How beautiful!

41
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,660
This sweet characterizes you.

42
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:44,940
Nao.

43
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,740
The Hotaru no jouga you made before...

44
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,980
I think I've tasted this somewhere before...

45
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,620
It was made by a girl named Sakura.

46
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,120
Ho!

47
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,780
What?

48
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,740
Nothing. Nevermind.

49
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,200
Everyone, hurry up! We're running out of time.

50
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,300
Yes!

51
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,740
When the front door is opened slightly,

52
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,320
it means the event has begun.

53
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:24,300
And...

54
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,520
Today, that room will be unlocked.

55
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,520
(Hamabe Minami)

56
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,520
(Yokohama Ryusei)

57
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,780
=Cursed in love=

58
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,320
Professor, please enjoy!

59
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:08,960
Thank you.

60
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:12,580
Thank you for coming today, Takigawa-san.

61
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,580
It's my honour to be invited again this year.

62
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,280
Look, they're perfect for each other.

63
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,120
Nao-san... um, I...

64
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,680
Haseya-san's...

65
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:31,260
I'm sorry I'm so impudent coming here.

66
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,700
But I got Tsubaki-san's permission.

67
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,340
No, I'm sorry about that...

68
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,660
Isn't that the girl, who crashed the wedding?

69
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,240
Yes.

70
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,160
Oh, she's the one they're talking about.

71
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,820
She must be pretty thick-skinned, mustn't she?

72
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:52,120
I apologize but...

73
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:56,280
did you know that
the roots of the cherry tree are very thick?

74
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:01,660
Sometimes they can even lift up the concrete.

75
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:07,080
And the stronger and thicker the roots are,
the more beautiful...

76
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,000
the more plentiful the blossom is.

77
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,820
Without such that brave,

78
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,460
there's no way someone can continue this shop.

79
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:17,780
I see, Kougetsuan-san...

80
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,720
Now that you has a strong-willed bride,

81
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,360
it means more and more prosperity.

82
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,920
I hate how beautiful they are.

83
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,400
That's true.

84
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,440
Tsubaki-san is the only one
who can make lines like these.

85
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,600
I don't think I'll ever be as good.

86
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,440
I want to remember these forever.

87
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,540
All the sweets that Tsubaki made.

88
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,360
Another year, another great pastry.

89
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,080
Hmmm, this is brilliant.

90
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,000
Delicious!

91
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,500
That was all very beautiful!

92
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,600
That's right.

93
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:25,020
After the sweets,
we need to prepare the main room

94
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,440
Nao-san!

95
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,440
What's wrong? Jojima-kun.

96
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,880
Nao-san,
something is bothering you, isn't it?

97
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:33,660
What?

98
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,540
You can tell me anything.
I want to help you.

99
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:47,560
I'm not good enough?

100
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:52,080
Oh, look, I...

101
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,940
I still owe you for the...

102
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,420
For the warabi-mochi, so...

103
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,420
Ah... thank you.

104
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:03,820
Really... anything I can do to help, just let me know.

105
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,780
Then...

106
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:12,000
Promise me you will reopen Shimaya one day.

107
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:14,360
Yes.

108
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,800
Where? Where is it?

109
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,120
Where the hell is it?

110
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,460
What are you doing in my room?

111
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,260
Grand Master...
I didn't know you were there.

112
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,160
If you raised your voice...

113
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,040
Is this what you're looking for?

114
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:51,040
(Will)

115
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,620
You're still as sneaky as ever.

116
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:59,180
You thought you could sneak
past me during the tea ceremony.

117
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,140
It was a night like this.

118
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,960
When I first started
suspecting your character.

119
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:14,740
I was at a tea ceremony and came home late.

120
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:18,160
So I cut through the garden to go back to my room.

121
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:20,820
I saw you with another man...

122
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,920
When I realized that's not Itsuki,

123
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,380
For the first time I...

124
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,740
saw someone resemble a monster!

125
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,920
Doesn't Tsubaki look just like...

126
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,500
that man?

127
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,760
Well...

128
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,900
Please give me your will!

129
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,320
Ugh!

130
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,140
Why did you betray me?

131
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,640
When I first saw you,

132
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,700
I'm the one who took you in this house!

133
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:10,460
That's why I didn't kick you out.

134
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:17,000
You were from Kaga's top families,
daughter of the Ootori family,

135
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:20,400
As beautiful and intelligent as a butterfly.

136
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,640
I thought you'd be
a good landlady for Kougetsuan!

137
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,980
But you were not a butterfly at all.

138
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,980
You're an evil snake,

139
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,760
who will swallow up this shop!

140
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,200
But who...

141
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,100
made me be like this?

142
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:54,500
I married into this family 25 years ago.

143
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,460
I was full of hope.

144
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:03,260
I thought I'd be loved by Itsuki-san,

145
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:07,700
and spend everyday happily with him.

146
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:13,880
That I'd dedicate my whole life to this man.

147
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:17,720
I had made a vow in my heart.

148
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,240
And yet...

149
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,200
Itsuki-san

150
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:37,360
never loved me.

151
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:45,040
He won't even touch...

152
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,360
Not even once!

153
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,060
After all, Tsubaki is...

154
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,380
Even your father-in-law didn't look into it.

155
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:09,760
Because you don't want to find out
that Tsubaki is not your real grandson, do you?

156
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,180
He's your umbrella for that rainy day.

157
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,440
Why?

158
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,780
Why do you want to take everything away from me?

159
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:23,500
Stop!

160
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,960
It's Tsubaki who's going to take over this shop!

161
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,760
No matter what!!! Ahhh!

162
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,300
(Will)

163
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,840
Grand Master...

164
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:05,780
Tsubaki-san, I'll go change the candles
in the tea room before dinner.

165
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,380
Yes, please.

166
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,660
Grand Master?

167
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:19,200
Once a year, after the tea ceremony...

168
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:22,480
The Grand Master drinks
only one cup of tea in this room.

169
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:16,180
That's true, I've seen it.

170
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:20,240
Mom... we have to go get mom.

171
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:23,840
In a garden full of camellia flowers.

172
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,920
There was a woman.

173
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,000
Tsubaki-san, should we take the guests
to the main room?

174
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,720
You're right.

175
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,800
Oh, by the way,
Is Nao still not back yet?

176
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,440
It's a bit late, isn't it?

177
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,300
No one is here.

178
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,140
Listen, Tsubaki...

179
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,560
One day you're going to take over this shop.

180
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,460
Promise me!

181
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:22,920
Are you going to let
Tsubaki-san take over Kougetsuan?

182
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,380
That's what I intend to do.

183
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,380
That girl,

184
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,120
I think Tsubaki calls her Sakura.

185
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,620
Yes.

186
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:36,140
I think everyone thinks she's Sakura.

187
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,140
That's good.

188
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,720
I wish for her...

189
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,740
They've kept us waiting for a long time.

190
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,700
Don't you think it's about to start soon?

191
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,200
Yes.

192
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,640
Why are you here?

193
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,500
What are you doing?

194
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,200
Can I ask you the same.

195
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,800
What are you doing
in the middle of the tea ceremony?

196
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,160
Can't you tell?

197
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,320
I'm airing out the kimono.

198
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,140
You have to do it once a year.

199
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:27,000
If not, they will be ruined in no time.

200
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:32,800
This room was The Master's room, wasn't it?

201
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,920
I heard that he was stabbed to death here.

202
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:41,040
by the craftsmen who worked with him.

203
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:43,380
It was just some work-related jealousy.

204
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,680
He didn't do anything wrong.

205
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:52,860
But people think he died of an illness, right?

206
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:57,640
I heard from one of our long-standing customers.

207
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:01,360
The master and that craftsmen,

208
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,740
They were close.

209
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,780
That they were in love with each other.

210
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,940
I've love him... for a long time.

211
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,940
Please give me back my Itsuki-san!

212
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,320
Noisy.

213
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,740
Shut up! How dare you say that to me?

214
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:00,920
Love... Two people in love...

215
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:06,360
Tell me. Am I supposed to
forgive them because of that?

216
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,440
Although he's in a committed
marriage with his wife?

217
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,640
In the beginning,

218
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:19,360
I trusted him that he hired her as an artisan.

219
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:23,160
Oh my! What a lovely sweet!

220
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,260
Did you make this?

221
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,180
That's amazing!

222
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,020
Thank you.

223
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:33,620
But it was this woman.

224
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:43,140
The two of them shattered my heart into pieces.

225
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:48,460
They tore my beautiful wings off
and turned me into a monster!

226
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,440
And those two...

227
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,260
didn't get punished at all.

228
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,160
I hated them.

229
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:04,700
From the bottom of my heart.

230
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,920
Are you sure, Tsubaki-san?

231
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:12,120
Did you really see her in your father's room?

232
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,740
You saw them fight, didn't you?

233
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,200
You saw it, didn't you? Didn't you?

234
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,860
Who? Who was it?

235
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,800
Sakura's mother.

236
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,080
Excuse me!

237
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,120
Are you okay?

238
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:35,960
Hey, be careful.

239
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,860
Yes, sir.

240
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,800
Did you get hurt?

241
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,760
Does anyone... smell something?

242
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,720
That's why...

243
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,620
That's why you framed her.

244
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,900
Did you also stab The Master?

245
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,260
No, I didn't.

246
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:05,180
Tell me the truth!

247
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,940
You have no proof whatsoever!

248
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,680
I will take you to court!

249
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,060
I'll say that I saw you that day.

250
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,940
What did you just say?

251
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,440
I am...

252
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,040
I am...

253
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:33,820
Sakura.

254
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,500
I am that artisan's...

255
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,700
(To Sakura: I didn't do anything)

256
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:45,140
I am the daughter of Yuriko Okura.

257
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,140
Thank you, Nao-san.

258
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:18,260
You've finally said it.

259
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,800
Hey.

260
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,700
You heard that, didn't you?

261
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,420
That girl...

262
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:42,020
I think Tsubaki calls her Sakura.

263
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:45,420
I think everyone thinks it's Sakura.

264
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,420
That's good.

265
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:49,860
I wish for her...

266
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:52,900
to be free of the curse of this shop.

267
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,660
I hope she can be free to make her own pastries.

268
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:04,160
Tsubaki.

269
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,720
Sakura.

270
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,520
Tsubaki.

271
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,160
Sakura.

272
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,840
Let's hurry up!

273
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,180
Tell everyone!
What are they doing?

274
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:38,520
There's a fire!

275
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,620
What? What?

276
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:41,240
Hey, where's the fire? I don't know.

277
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,200
But the main house...

278
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,400
We have to evacuate our guests!

279
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,760
Yes!

280
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,580
Now...

281
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,780
Did you say you are Sakura?

282
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,920
You are...

283
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,220
Nao...

284
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:14,440
You're lying... aren't you?

285
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:33,220
15 years ago.

286
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:36,600
What happened in this room?

287
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:40,500
I wanted to know the truth...

288
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:47,480
I know my mom didn't kill The Master.

289
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,840
I'm....

290
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:56,200
I'm here to prove my mom's innocence.

291
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:08,100
Did you lie
in front of the hanging scroll?

292
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:16,900
All of them... All of them...

293
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,580
All of them!

294
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:26,680
Why?

295
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,840
Tsubaki.

296
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,920
No.

297
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:40,820
Tsubaki-san, we've got a problem! There's a fire!

298
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,760
The whole house is filled with smoke.

299
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,040
Everyone have been evacuated.

300
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,720
Except the Grand Master...

301
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,540
His room? Did you check the Grand Master's room?

302
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:52,600
I can't get close to it
because there's too much smoke.

303
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:55,080
I'll look for him. Yamaguchi-san,
you take care of the shop.

304
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:55,760
Yes!

305
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,540
Tsubaki!

306
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,700
You'd better get out of here quickly.

307
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,640
I'll be waiting for you.

308
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,020
I'll wait here, for Tsubaki!

309
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,820
Everyone, please calm down.

310
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:34,140
We're checking the escape routes.

311
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:35,880
The shop's fine.

312
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,460
All right, everybody, this way!

313
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:40,780
Over here! Where's Tsubaki-san and Nao-san?

314
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,980
What?
Are they still in the main house?

315
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,160

We can't get there.

Right.

You've come to take everything from me.

00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,760
that this day would come.

Tsubaki-san is as good as the Grand Master.

338
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,820
He treasures this shop!

339
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:55,640
That was just another lie to deceive me, wasn't it?

340
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,060
To her, I'm the enemy of her parents.

341
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,260
But...

342
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,600
No problem, we'll take care of it.

343
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,800
He loves sweets and he's a purist.

344
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,100
We've got two idiots here, so we'll be fine!

345
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,040
Why?

346
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:16,040
You always gave me the words I wanted...

347
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,220
Nao.

348
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:28,020
I'm afraid Tsubaki won't forgive me.

349
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,320
But...

350
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:32,220
Nao, I love you.

351
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:36,520
Everything about Tsubaki,

352
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,180
I just love them all.

353
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:45,640
That's all I have to tell him before I lose him.

354
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,280
Will you marry me?

355
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:06,660
Nao. Nao.

356
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:10,180
I've found my first...

357
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:15,000
happiness.

358
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,380
Nao-san! What are you doing here?

359
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,160
Let's go!

360
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,080
I'll be here.

361
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,420
I'm waiting for Tsubaki.

362
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,380
We don't know when the fire will get here.

363
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,680
What?

364
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:44,420
Oh no.

365
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,200
What's wrong with you?

366
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,720
Oh no... just that...

367
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,840
Wait... quickly...

368
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:53,980
Nao-san!

369
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:56,140
Tsubaki.

370
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,940
Nao-san! What's going on?

371
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,760
I don't know. She collapsed suddenly.

372
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,280
Let's get out of here now.

373
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,340
No.

374
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,820
Wait... no...

375
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,280
(Kougetsuan)
We're all trapped.

376
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,560
By the curse of the shop.

377
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,120
Nao.

378
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:45,700
Nao.

379
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,280
Yuko-san.

380
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,900
Thank goodness.

381
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,080
You're awake.

382
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:58,840
Excuse me. This is Hanaoka.
Nao is awake.

383
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,840
Can I get a doctor here, please!

384
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,080
I...

385
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:07,540
I was so shocked to here you were in a fire.

386
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:10,380
But I'm glad that you're safe.

387
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,480
Fire...

388
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,060
Tsubaki... Where is Tsubaki?

389
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,300
As for Mr. Tsubaki...

390
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,260
I don't know the details.

391
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:26,760
- What...
- But with the fire...

392
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:29,320
I heard that no one died.

393
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,380
So I'm sure he's fine.

394
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,300
Thank goodness.

395
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:38,980
Is Tsubaki awake yet?

396
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:41,920
Still...

397
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:46,480
Ugh... it hurts.

398
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,420
Are you OK?

399
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,180
What about my baby?

400
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,180
Well.

401
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:08,800
I guess... I didn't make it.

402
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:14,860
A mom like me...

403
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:17,920
You must hate me, right?

404
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,020
That's not true.

405
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:22,880
Don't say that!

406
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:26,100
It was no one's fault!

407
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:31,320
It was no one's fault. It's okay.

408
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,700
I've had my punishment.

409
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:40,860
Nao-san shouldn't come back to Kougetsuan.

410
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:45,060
She'll just continue to suffer if she get back.

411
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,420
It'll be okay.

412
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,760
Please don't cry.

413
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,760
(Kanazawa Daiichi Hospital)

414
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:00,840
I don't know what I'm supposed to do from now on...

415
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,480
Did Tsubaki get back after that?

416
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,800
Or...

417
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,080
Two days since the fire at Kougetsuan.

418
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,680
The locals are mourning the partial loss

419
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,280
of the historic main house of the building.

420
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,980
I heard you managed to save the tools,

421
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:20,700
which are considered municipal cultural assets.

422
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,260
Here it is!

423
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,560
Our young master save this set.

424
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:27,560
Risking his life in the flames,

425
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:31,700
After rescuing the Grand Master,
he went back to get these tools.

426
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:38,440
The tools which belongs to the proper successor.

427
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:43,640
I wil not let anyone take over this shop.

428
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:47,640
Tsubaki protected it.

429
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:51,640
I'll be here waiting for Tsubaki!

430
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,620
I've been deceiving Tsubaki all along.

431
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,100
Of course he won't forgive me.

432
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:15,200
Mom...

433
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,900
I'm sorry.

434
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,240
I couldn't do anything.

435
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:23,100
Because of that woman...

436
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:26,100
Even though I figured out that
she was the one who frame you...

437
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,580
I'm sorry...

438
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:41,120
Sis, are you hungry?

439
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:48,040
Here, you can have one.

440
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,280
Thank you.

441
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,040
But now...

442
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,260
Go ahead!

443
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,700
Sweet...

444
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:30,180
Delicious.

445
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,880
Delicious.

446
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,500
Really?

447
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,520
Thank you.

448
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,320
Haruka!

449
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:44,780
Mommy!

450
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:52,980
Nao-chan.

451
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,200
Why...

452
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:03,000
the meal I just ate..

453
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,200
was so bland.

454
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,940
But these sweets...?

455
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:18,680
Nao-chan.

456
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,060
What do you want to do now?

457
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:26,000
Do you want to go back to Kougetsuan?

458
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:37,800
What I really want to do...

459
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,440
I...

460
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:45,420
I just want to make sweets.

461
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:50,700
I want to go back to that time.

462
00:34:51,220 --> 00:34:53,200
Making sweets was so fun.

463
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:56,700
I'm so happy every time I finish one...

464
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,180
All I have...

465
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:02,380
is just the love for making sweets.

466
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,360
Let's forget everything.

467
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,260
Including Kougetsuan...

468
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,000
I love you.

469
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,840
And Tsubaki.

470
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:32,700
It's all right... I can forget.

471
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:36,380
I'm sure... I'm sure...

472
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:44,380
(Kougetsuan)
(Three months later)

473
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:49,140
And finally, take the sweet paste

474
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:54,500
place it in the centre of the flower
by chopsticks.

475
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,000
Now you have the autumn wildflower,
the cosmos.

476
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,840
Wow, it's beautiful! It's beautiful!

477
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:04,860
Next month we will be making the peony.

478
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,140
I'll come! Me too!

479
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:08,040
Me too...

480
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:12,560
What a silly idea, a Japanese sweets class.

481
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,040
As the master of the shop,
this is not your job.

482
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:17,920
What's wrong with trying something new?

483
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:21,060
And I'm not the master yet.

484
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,420
I'm just filling in for the Grand Master
while he's in hospital.

485
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,860
And Nao-san.

486
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,580
When are you going to stop looking for her?

487
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,780
I heard you're asking around

488
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:37,720
all the shop in this prefecture.

489
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:41,380
What's the point of finding out now?

490
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:44,020
The day of the fire.

491
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:46,760
You chose the inheritance

492
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,780
of this shop over her.

493
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:51,780
That was because...

494
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:57,100
After the fire.

495
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:00,440
I was unconscious for ten days.

496
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,380
When I woke up,

497
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:06,560
She's gone.

498
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:10,060
Why do I want to find Nao?

499
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,300
I'm not even sure myself.

500
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:17,880
I don't know whether this feeling is love or hate.

501
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:20,160
The one you should be focusing on,

502
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,740
Isn't there anyone else?

503
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,600
(Takatsuki)
Excuse me.

504
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,580
Thanks for holding a class just for me.

505
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:39,760
No.

506
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,940
Tsubaki-san!

507
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:04,120
Tsubaki-san?

508
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,760
Thank goodness!

509
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,240
I'm really sorry.

510
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:19,560
It's my fault.

511
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:24,080
Please don't apologize anymore.

512
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,920
I did that on my own...

513
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:28,980
Don't worry about it, really.

514
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:35,860
You picked a very bright red color.

515
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:40,320
Oh, did I do it wrong?
I'll redo it right away.

516
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,060
Shiori-san, do you like red?

517
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,080
You wear a lot of red kimono too.

518
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,840
Ah... yes.

519
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,840
Since I was a kid.

520
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:55,600
It cheers me up
and makes me stand out.

521
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:57,380
Stand out?

522
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:00,600
I have two sisters.

523
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:04,400
They're both beautiful and charming.

524
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:08,220
Compared to them, I'm so plain and boring.

525
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:11,820
So if you wear red,

526
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:14,140
I think people will notice me more.

527
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:18,760
For my father,

528
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,500
he said "Don't wear it, it doesn't suit you".

529
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:24,300
I'm sure everyone think so.

530
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:27,780
I don't think...

531
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:31,060
Why would you assume that?

532
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:32,920
It's my own opinion.

533
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:47,000
I like it a lot.

534
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,060
You can't say that, Tsubaki-san...

535
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:04,580
(Haseya) We're very excited to
become a family with you.

536
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:15,580
Thank you very much for everything.

537
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,880
With my daughter scarred like this,

538
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,280
I won't have been surprised if you said no.

539
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:23,520
Oh no... it was an accident.

540
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,380
For Shiori-san...

541
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:28,900
I will make sure she doesn't have to
face any guest, please don't worry.

542
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:34,020
I'm sorry, this may be old-fashioned, but

543
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:37,100
I'd like Shiori-san to a be homemaker
as much as possible.

544
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:41,320
Shiori?

545
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:45,020
Why do you assume?

546
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:47,180
I like it a lot.

547
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:11,900
Today.

548
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:16,000
I brought you some cold peonies
as they were in bloom.

549
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,940
Excuse me...

550
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:27,000
Excuse me, has anyone else been here today?

551
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,760
Oh, that wasn't there before.

552
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,220
I wonder who did that?

553
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,920
Autumnalis Cherry.

554
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,280
Sakura.

555
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:45,460
Nao!

556
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:54,720
Sorry.

557
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,080
I knew it!

558
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:59,180
I can't get married.

559
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,880
There's something I really want.

560
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:16,200
Shiori, come here for a minute!

561
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:17,920
I don't want to!

562
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:21,160
"You've got nothing to show for it".

563
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:24,640
"The sooner you get married, the better".

564
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:27,960
Your words,

565
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:31,120
I've always believed in it, I've never doubted it.

566
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:34,780
But I...

567
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:38,400
I want to wear a red kimono!

568
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:44,860
Set me free.

569
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,300
Nao.

570
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,300
(Will)

571
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:10,260
I'll sue you.

572
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,500
"I saw you that day.

573
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:19,200
You have to crush anyone who gets in your way.

574
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,160
(Kougetsuan)

575
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:24,280
Please...

576
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:26,360
Do you want to work for us?

577
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,780
Yes, I've run away from home.

578
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:32,920
Can you put it here?

579
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:36,060
But why...?

580
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:41,440
You may not remember Tsubaki-san.

581
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:45,820
Two years ago at a painting exhibition.

582
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:47,940
It was the first time I met Tsubaki-san.

583
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:49,940
What?

584
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,920
No one cared.

585
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:58,180
At a time when I was thinking
"I don't know who I am after all"...

586
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,420
This camellia,

587
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:03,760
why are there no leaves?

588
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,480
It's said that a fallen camellia is a bad omen.

589
00:44:07,820 --> 00:44:10,060
Oh, but that's...

590
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:13,200
Because the camellias are so beautiful.

591
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:17,780
Some say it's a superstition, spread by
the greats of old to keep them to themselves.

592
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:20,100
I like it better...

593
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:23,260
Because it's beautiful.

594
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:26,740
Interesting.

595
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:29,500
I like it and I'll take it.

596
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:34,960
Please...

597
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,760
Please hire me at Kougetsuan.

598
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:40,020
About me...

599
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,660
I don't want to give up now.

600
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:47,460
Please.

601
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:51,900
If you don't think you have the right qualities

602
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:55,700
We'll get rid of you soon.

603
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:00,820
That's...

604
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,240
I'm sure you'll be out in a month.

605
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:13,380
I...

606
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,460
I'm dying to do my best.

607
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:26,460
(Autumn 3 years later)

608
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,460
(Kougetsuan)

609
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:30,540
(Chestnut cake)
Go ahead.

610
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:32,340
Thank you. Thank you.

611
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:34,020
Thank you very much.

612
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:35,740
Shiori.

613
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:38,680
A little.

614
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,220
You have a customer who's looking for Shiori-san?

615
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:44,500
Yes.

616
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:46,500
He listens to me without hesitation.

617
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:47,300
He was so happy.

618
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:50,240
At first I could barely say "Irasshaimase".

619
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,760
Now it's my...

620
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,760
Oh, it's a shop sign.

621
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:56,820
That's encouraging.

622
00:45:58,460 --> 00:45:58,900
Jojima.

623
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:01,700
What is this colouring?

624
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,920
No, I thought the more vivid the better.

625
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,380
There will be no more products.

626
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:07,660
Be careful.

627
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:09,360
Yes.

628
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:12,260
Tsubaki-san, it's almost time
for the Kouwakai tea ceremony.

629
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:14,260
Oh, I'm sorry.

630
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:16,860
Yamaguchi-san,
could you please continue with the molding?

631
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:18,720
Yes...that's right.

632
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:21,480
What sweets do you want to serve
at the Mayfair Pavilion selection meeting?

633
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:23,480
I'll leave that to you too, Mr. Yamaguchi.

634
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:24,740
Yes, you can.

635
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:32,740
He doesn't make many sweets
for the shop these days, does he?

636
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:34,740
You don't have a choice.

637
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:37,380
I do everything on behalf of the Grand Master.

638
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:40,720
I'm a lot busier than I used to be.

639
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:45,920
My nails are such a mess.

640
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:50,420
No, you have to look after it properly.

641
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:51,780
Sorry.

642
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:54,760
The landlady does it herself...

643
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:56,560
It's my dream.

644
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:59,560
I'm going to do this for my daughter-in-law.

645
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:02,140
Oh no...

646
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:07,000
I'm really enjoying working here...

647
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:12,320
My words make my customers happy and responsive.

648
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:14,320
That's it...

649
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:17,260
We've been here for three years.

650
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,800
Nothing with Tsubaki-san?

651
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:27,420
Huh... it's no use.

652
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:43,980
The landlady...

653
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:50,300
A seductive scent that will make any man swoon.

654
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:54,520
Sometimes you have to take the initiative.

655
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:58,960
Shiori is...

656
00:47:59,780 --> 00:48:02,760
It's very attractive.

657
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:18,820
Excuse me.

658
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:24,960
Thank you very much.

659
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:27,340
Um, Tsubaki-san...

660
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:29,620
The next holiday...

661
00:48:30,620 --> 00:48:31,520
Hmm?

662
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,180
Excuse me.

663
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:39,560
Ah... then I'll take this.

664
00:48:40,100 --> 00:48:41,060
Oh...

665
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,920
This is the money I owe you for this month.

666
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:54,300
You're a stubborn man.

667
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:55,960
Then.

668
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:59,160
Tomorrow, you'll start
helping with the main pastry.

669
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:03,100
Yay!

670
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:05,920
Huh, but why all of a sudden?

671
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:07,600
You've been here for four years now.

672
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:11,020
And those bright colours on Jojima.

673
00:49:11,020 --> 00:49:13,120
I believe that one day it will be an advantage.

674
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:17,320
Oh... wow.

675
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:20,860
Come to think of it, Nao-san was a pale colour.

676
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:27,280
Tsubaki-san, about Nao-san...

677
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,700
I chose this shop over Nanazakura that day.

678
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:33,700
(Hamabe Minami)

679
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:40,620
Tsubaki!

680
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:48,460
Are you okay? Hey! You, go to the back!

681
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:49,160
Yes!

682
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:56,420
Everytime I think about her

683
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:59,240
The same scene always comes to mind.

684
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:03,420
A small Japanese sweets shop
in a quiet town.

685
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:06,260
That's where she makes pastries every day.

686
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:09,360
Forget all about this world

687
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:11,940
She is free to create.

688
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:14,600
Three years...

689
00:50:17,260 --> 00:50:19,580
It's time to put it behind us.

690
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:24,980
I'm sure she's already looking forward to it.

691
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:27,460
Tsubaki-san...

692
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:34,360
You're happy, aren't you?

693
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,220
What do you mean?

694
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:40,380
The sweets we will be serving for the next year...

695
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:43,340
They've decided to go to another shop.

696
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:44,620
Oh no...

697
00:50:44,620 --> 00:50:47,120
In a shop that makes very interesting pastries.

698
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:49,360
What kind of shop is it?

699
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:50,900
Indeed...

700
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:53,100
I think it's called "flower vase".

701
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:54,580
"Hanagasumi".

702
00:50:56,580 --> 00:50:57,580
(Hanagasumi)

703
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:03,200
Male It looks delicious.

704
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:05,200
Thank you very much.

705
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:09,400
We've decided on the sweets from the May Festival.

706
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:10,480
Okay.

707
00:51:11,080 --> 00:51:14,580
Do you think he'll notice your sweets?
Tsubaki-kun is.

708
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:18,440
Maybe... but no matter.

709
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:25,600
I'm going to ask Kougetsuan to disappear now.

710
00:51:28,850 --> 00:51:30,560
(From the fiance to the enemy)
Why did you disappear without saying a word?

711
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:31,850
(From the fiance to the enemy)
I am Sakura.

712
00:51:32,310 --> 00:51:34,460
Until the dream comes true, it's still not...

713
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:36,050
(Emotional interference)
I will always be by your side.

714
00:51:36,050 --> 00:51:37,250
(Emotional interference)
Tsubaki, hug me! Please!

715
00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:38,250
Tsubaki, hug me! Please!

716
00:51:38,350 --> 00:51:39,010
Shiori-san.

717
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:41,350
I won't forgive, if you don't take responsibility.

718
00:51:41,350 --> 00:51:42,650
Get out of my way!
