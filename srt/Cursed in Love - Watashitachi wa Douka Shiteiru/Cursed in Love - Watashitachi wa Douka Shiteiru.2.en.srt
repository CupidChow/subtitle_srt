1
00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:05,000
15 years ago.

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,140
With a word from Tsubaki...

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:09,380
I was stollen everything.

4
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,320
Who? Who did that?

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:14,680
That was Sakura's mother.

6
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:18,400
- I didn't know anything
- Mom! Mom!

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,780
- I was just making sweets
- Mom! Mom!

8
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,640
Finally, I could meet you.
Hanaoka Nao-san.

9
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,560
It's letter from your mother.

10
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:28,560
(Dear Nao, I didn't do it.)
To finding the truth...

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,140
Will you marry me?

12
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,300
Just do it...Marriage.

13
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,380
Using the marriage,

14
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,360
with the one I hate most-Tsubaki,

15
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,580
I'm hiding my real identity.

16
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,150
(Kougetsuan)
That day, I went into Kougetsuan

17
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:42,200
That day, I went into Kougetsuan

18
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,300
the place where I was kicked out.

19
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,040
I'm going to marry this woman.

20
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,040
What is waiting me there...?

21
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,500
How you can be so selfish?
You're so disgraceful!

22
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,700
The landlady of Kougetsuan,
Tsubaki's mother and...

23
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,880
If you say so, then give me the result
in three months!

24
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,660
The grand master,
who has complete control of the shop.

25
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,160
In near future, I'll make
this shop become mine.

26
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,080
My fiancee is not a sweet person.

27
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:07,740
But,

28
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,340
I have to find the truth.

29
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,040
From today, please help me.

30
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:20,450
(Kougetsu)

31
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,980
It's almost six o'clock.

32
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,420
Come quickly.

33
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,320
This is the heart of Kougetsuan.

34
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,120
Craftsmen, Yamaguchi-san and Tomioka-san.

35
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,380
- Hello
- You're the one in the rumor.

36
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:46,080
And we also have three internships.

37
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,480
We've been put together.

38
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,580
My name is Hanaoka Nao.
Please help me.

39
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,040
Nao, you'll be here.

40
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:53,920
Yes!

41
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,760
Could you do this, couldn't?

42
00:01:58,380 --> 00:01:59,120
Washing up?

43
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,260
Don't agree?

44
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,720
It's what the underlings do.

45
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,520
It's the wife's work.

46
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,800
Tomioka-san!

47
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,380
I want to discuss with you
about the sweets of the next day.

48
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:11,720
Uh!

49
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,200
Do it well.

50
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,320
My work.

51
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,120
Right? she came to the wedding and ruined it?

52
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:25,460
That's her.

53
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:26,880
She's a bit simple.

54
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,880
But, that type of person is the best.

55
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,780
Terrible guy!

56
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,000
The smell of cooking red beans.

57
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,440
The sound of a sieve being tapped.

58
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,620
Each time, gas is turned on
I feel the heat.

59
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,960
Ah. It's so good!

60
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,280
I want to stay here forever!

61
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,140
Jojima.

62
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,000
Can you drain the red beans?

63
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:56,920
Yes!

64
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,720
Drain the red beans.

65
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,000
I love that word, too!

66
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:03,520
Wait!

67
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,760
Don't you forget? Sudden water.

68
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,760
When the red beans are cooked,

69
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,220
add water to lower
the temperature of the boiling water.

70
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,440
If do so, they'll be fluffy.

71
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,900
Look carefully at the state of the red beans.

72
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,440
The smell is changed.

73
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,900
Because, it shows the moment it becomes tasty.

74
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,000
The state of the red beans?

75
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,460
Oh my god...

76
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,360
Cold water.

77
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,220
Ahh, I'm sorry.

78
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,300
I've only been here a month
and I've forgotten everything I've heard.

79
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,340
Ahh! It's changing.

80
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,580
I miss these.

81
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,520
I dreamed about these when I was a kid.

82
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:43,340
Like my mom, in this place,

83
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:45,040
making so many sweets.

84
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,000
Abe.

85
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,400
Do you have enough white beans?

86
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,640
Oi, Yes!

87
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,260
Sugita!

88
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:50,480
Please prepare the yams.

89
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,680
Yes, yams!

90
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,980
It seems to be busy.

91
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,500
The day after tomorrow,

92
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,080
there's a prayer festival at Misaka Shrine.

93
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:01,060
Every year, Kougetsuan is entrusted
to make sweets for the festival.

94
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:04,160
The whole shop is very busy up to the day.

95
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,300
Every year?

96
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,600
How long has the oldest person been here?

97
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,640
I think...Tomioka-san...

98
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,400
He's been here for ten years.

99
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,060
Ten years?

100
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,900
Yamaguchi-san is about the same.

101
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:22,160
But this is a historic shop.

102
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,920
It's a wonder there isn't no one longer than us.

103
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:26,580
15 years ago,

104
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,980
when the previous owner passed away,

105
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,100
I heard that all the employees
have changed at once.

106
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,620
I think our customers are
getting to know us a bit longer.

107
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,820
Regular customers.

108
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,220
If I could talk to someone
who was at the time of the incident.

109
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,880
Maybe I'll get some clues.

110
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,390
(Kofukuya Shirafujiya)

111
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:10,760
This shop

112
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,160
still has sweets orders of over 50 years.

113
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:18,120
"Kofukuya Shirafujiya".

114
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:33,820
(Hamabe Minami)

115
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,140
(Yokohama Ryusei)

116
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,340
=Cursed in Love=

117
00:05:59,220 --> 00:05:59,920
(Kougetsuan)
Who is that?

118
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,780
Who did receive an order
from Shirafujiya-san for tomorrow?

119
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,660
You?

120
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:04,860
What happened?

121
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:08,040
There's an order from Shirafujiya-san
on the day of the Prayer Festival.

122
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:11,600
Everyone knows we're not taking
any orders tomorrow.

123
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:12,640
Who did that?

124
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,700
That's me.

125
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,280
I took the order.

126
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,500
There was an order call by coincidence.

127
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,940
Why did you do that?

128
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:24,920
And it's 12 o'clock, the same time
as the delivery of the votive sweets!

129
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,780
Everyone is so busy with the festival.

130
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:29,240
We can't deliver the sweets to Shirafujiya-san!

131
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,840
So, I'll do it.

132
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,300
I'm not joining to the festival.

133
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,060
No, you can't.

134
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,880
Shirafujiya-san is the important guest.

135
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,880
I will do it.

136
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,380
But...

137
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,460
Tsubaki-san!

138
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,640
All the landowners in the area
get together for the festival.

139
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:49,180
If you don't show up,

140
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,480
you will be considered an unsuitable heir.

141
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,440
Everybody please back to your work.

142
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:57,880
Tsubaki-san!

143
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,600
I had my chance but...

144
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,400
Wait!

145
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,040
Please belive me, Tsubaki-san!

146
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,580
I'll make sure to deliver to Shirafujiya-san, so...

147
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,840
What to believe in?
You've done what you've done!

148
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,380
Just do what you're told!

149
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,880
The sweets are ordered by Shirafujiya-san

150
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,760
are the same as the previous generation.

151
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:26,200
Sweets in the shape of a wisteria flower.

152
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:30,120
Wisteria is a symbol of procreation.

153
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,240
It's the heart and soul of Shirafujiya-san.

154
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:35,660
(Shirafuji)
Beans are white beans.

155
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,980
(Shirafuji)

156
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:40,080
(Shirafuji)
The shape is that of a garment of their business.

157
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,450
(Shirafuji)

158
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,480
I'll make it, too.

159
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,900
A shop that values trust
would never deny an order, right?

160
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:54,100
I see.

161
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,220
So, you'll do it.

162
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,740
But I'll make the sweets.

163
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,460
- But the festival's sweets...
- If I don't sleep, I can make them.

164
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,950
(Hayasa Inn)
Because of that, from the beginning,

165
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,820
I told you not to be a sweets maker's wife!

166
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,120
But you still insist!

167
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,090
You...

168
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:17,380
Shiori, forget everything about that man.

169
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,520
No further contact with him!

170
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:20,560
Father.

171
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,600
But I...

172
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,200
Shut up!

173
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,200
(On the day of the Prayer Festival)
- You, hurry up! - Yes.

174
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:52,980
(On the day of the Prayer Festival)

175
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:53,740
(On the day of the Prayer Festival)
Abe-san, how do we do this?

176
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:54,680
Abe-san, how do we do this?

177
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:58,380
Ah...

178
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:04,300
So, I'll be going.

179
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:06,580
Jojima.

180
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:07,300
Yes!

181
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,140
I won't forgive if there is any problem.

182
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:21,960
I know.

183
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,380
I won't cause any problem

184
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,520
Because of that,

185
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,380
(Kofuku)
I'm going.

186
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,380
(Kofuku)

187
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:42,720
I am pleased to announce that I'll marry Tsubaki,
the eldest son of Kougetsuan.

188
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,040
My name is Nao.

189
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,580
I apologise for coming so suddenly.

190
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,120
Thank you for coming all the way.

191
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,220
Ah, this is

192
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,060
(Kougetsuan)
for the greeting.

193
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:56,350
(Kougetsuan)
Thank you very much.

194
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:57,640
Thank you very much.

195
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,760
I'm going to call my husband now.

196
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,340
I have to do it well.

197
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,800
Even if today, I can't ask any thing.

198
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,800
If I come many times,

199
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,000
I'll able to know about the incident.

200
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,520
Please prepare a container for the sweets.

201
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:18,160
Yes!

202
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,160
(Kougetsuan)

203
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,720
What is the matter?

204
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,360
The sweets...

205
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,820
Kougetsuan-san!

206
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,220
How can this happen to the greeting sweets?

207
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,900
What do you mean?

208
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,120
The red... the red color...

209
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,200
Nao-san?

210
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:59,440
Passengers... Passengers...

211
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,060
- Where is this narrow road?
- Why?

212
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,520
It's Tenjin's narrow path.

213
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:14,740
Please let me through.

214
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,820
Tsubaki-san, What does it mean?

215
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,200
It's a punishment.

216
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,040
Because it seems that she was lying.

217
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:30,440
I'm coming to deliver the note.

218
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:37,780
Good on the way, scary on the way back.

219
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,040
It's what you deserve.

220
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,180
This is what happens when you lie.

221
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:56,420
Even though I'm scared,
Keep going, keep going.

222
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,640
I am really sorry!

223
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,640
Well, well, well, look up, please.

224
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,640
Are you feeling better now?

225
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,380
Sorry for the inconvenience.

226
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,050
Next time...

227
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:14,050
The sweets

228
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,360
say a lot about the person giving it.

229
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,460
Nao-san's feeling.

230
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,280
I've got the feeling.

231
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,440
Confidence.

232
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,780
I'll never be able to step over

233
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,860
the threshold of this shop again.

234
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,160
You look terrible.

235
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,840
I'm really sorry.

236
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,820
But, those sweets are for whom?

237
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:51,040
Why did you lie?

238
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:57,280
After you left,
I called Shirafujiya-san for confirmation.

239
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,460
They said,

240
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,220
"They didn't order".

241
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:09,560
It doesn't matter now who did it.

242
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,840
What I do know is

243
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:18,920
the reality that we have lost
one of our most important customers.

244
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,140
I wish Kougetsuan would disappear.

245
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,000
That's what I've always thought.

246
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,200
Those are Kougetsuan's sweets?

247
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,660
I brought some gifts.

248
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,660
Woa. I like it.

249
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,880
The sweets of Kougetsuan

250
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,660
are loved by every one.

251
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,240
Why?

252
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,440
Everything was taken from me.

253
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,960
If Kougetsuan disappears,

254
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,920
my suffering will be over.

255
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:56,440
But...

256
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,780
Now, if this place disappears,

257
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,700
I won't never know the truth.

258
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,680
Tsubaki.

259
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:12,140
Would you show the results in three months?

260
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:25,360
Ah?! What are you doing here?

261
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,700
I'm sorry.

262
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,180
I'm just thinking.

263
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,700
Why don't you drink tea in your room?

264
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,360
I feel calm down when being here.

265
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,560
The smell of the red beans...

266
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,080
I've known!

267
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,400
It's so comforting, isn't it?

268
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,900
The way of the steam billows out...

269
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,320
The old tools and stuff...

270
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,150
I don't get paranoid, right?
What kind of sweets can be made!

271
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:48,280
It's a great way to fill up...

272
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:53,600
Ah! It's been a long time.

273
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,400
What's the matter with you?

274
00:14:57,720 --> 00:14:59,580
It's about about Shirafujiya-san.

275
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,160
I'm glad you got that order.

276
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,980
They are the best customer of Kougetsuan.

277
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:08,800
Even the landlady checked the sweets.

278
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,040
Eh?

279
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:11,580
The landlady?

280
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,580
Yes. I caught a glimpse of her this morning.

281
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:17,280
She's rarely done that before.

282
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,080
I see.

283
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:23,900
Nao-san?

284
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,900
Ara, it's so late.

285
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,300
What are you doing with my stuff?

286
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:37,060
I'm packing for you.

287
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,060
I can't keep who was rude to customers.

288
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:46,160
Ara? What's wrong with you? Your face?

289
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,340
Ah! It's about money right?

290
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:59,800
This is what you've wanted from the start, isn't it?

291
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,020
I've known it!

292
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,740
Good bye, Nao-san.

293
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:10,360
To get rid of me... The sweets...

294
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,860
I won't go anywhere!

295
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:21,360
I will try to get the
forgiveness from Shirafujiya-san.

296
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:22,740
What're you talking?

297
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,220
That nails...

298
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,860
They doesn't match with your kimono.

299
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,760
It's a red nail polish, isn't it?

300
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:34,700
What are you talking about?

301
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:38,560
I'm going to marry Tsubaki-san!

302
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,660
Unless Tsubaki-san says that, I won't go anywhere!

303
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,280
Pestilence!

304
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,480
The butterflies...

305
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:10,640
They only leave butterflies
as beautiful as themselves.

306
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,380
They don't be family with moths.

307
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,980
We don't need strangers!

308
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:20,460
Nah, Tsubaki.

309
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,220
You found that girl.

310
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,440
Are we talking about it again?

311
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,060
Please take your medicine.

312
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:32,900
Excuse me.

313
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,420
Tsubaki-san, you have a phone call.

314
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,320
Tsubaki.

315
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:49,400
Do you know what is
the important thing for me?

316
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,600
You have to heir Kougetsuan.

317
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,480
Landlady!

318
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,340
Please stop it!

319
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:15,640
Tsubaki-san would never take you for a fool!

320
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,260
Now get out of here!

321
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,680
Please, please stop it.

322
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:22,460
- This girl!
- Get off me!

323
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:25,840
Inside it...

324
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,180
If Nao wants to do it,
then I want you continue making it.

325
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,860
That's dirty!

326
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:49,760
Don't be back to Kougetsuan again!

327
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:52,500
What are you doing?

328
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:54,600
Tsubaki-san.

329
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,160
Don't cry.

330
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,800
I'm kicking her out of here.

331
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,420
You are supposed to do the same, aren't you?

332
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,560
I knew it all along.

333
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:10,640
There's no one here who can help you.

334
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,640
Not anyone.

335
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,880
Tsubaki-san!

336
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,580
I'm going to let Nao stay here a bit longer.

337
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,440
I had a phone call with Shirafujiya-san.

338
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,020
They want to order 20 monakas.

339
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:48,540
However,

340
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,580
they want Nao to make them.

341
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,200
As I thought, the tea you make is the best.

342
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,720
No.

343
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,320
It's just a hobby.

344
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,940
Oh, by the way, as you said,

345
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,500
I've placed an order with Kougetsuan.

346
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:10,840
To be honest, I don't understand.

347
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:14,820
Why Tsubaki-san want to marry that girl?

348
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,820
I you have her sweets,

349
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,700
Once you might understand.

350
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,840
Let's enjoy it.

351
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,260
I'll show you the bean paste of Kougetsuan.

352
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:41,900
(Kougetsuan)
Thank you.

353
00:20:42,260 --> 00:20:44,540
Monaka means "the moon of mid-autumn".

354
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:47,260
Kougetsuan's monaka is made of red bean paste.

355
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,560
When you eat it,

356
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,000
it becomes one with the cover of the monaka.

357
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,200
When the red bean paste is ready,

358
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,280
add an equal amount of coarse rice and knead.

359
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,060
I see!

360
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,920
When the glow has became
to a reddish purple colour.

361
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,580
It is ready to be kneaded.

362
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,160
This one will decide
the taste of the bean paste.

363
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:05,600
I understand.

364
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,600
It's not good at all.

365
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:22,360
During kneading, the fire was too strong.

366
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,150
And you must have turned off the fire too soon.

367
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:25,320
I see!

368
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,120
Tomioka-san, you've done well.

369
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,400
Ah, landlady.

370
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,480
How's it going?
The kitchen?

371
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,060
It's getting harder to do, isn't it?

372
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:43,000
Not at all.

373
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,120
The reason why Kougetsuan is here today.

374
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,200
Thanks to Tomioka-san.

375
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,160
Be more confident.

376
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,100
I'll make it easy for you.

377
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:58,760
Eh?

378
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,900
That's why I said I won't let you use the kitchen.

379
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,340
It disturbs my work.

380
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,380
I'll do it more in the corner then.

381
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,500
Don't even use a pot.

382
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,680
You'll make a lousy bean paste.

383
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,860
What happens when the taste wrong?

384
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,800
Look, Yamaguchi-san,
you don't like it either.

385
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,800
I'm OK.

386
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,000
It interferes right?

387
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,040
It interferes. Yes

388
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:17,540
Yes.

389
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:19,180
Anyway, get out of here.

390
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:19,760
That...

391
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,760
If I can't use this place, I can't make bean jam.

392
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:24,320
Please.

393
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,560
Move it!

394
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,700
Sorry, Tomioka-san.

395
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,940
Could you please be patient until we raise

396
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,380
the order for the Shirafujiya-san?

397
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,580
It's an important order for
the shop redeem itself.

398
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,020
I don't know.

399
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:38,840
Not a request.

400
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,560
Even if I say it's an order?

401
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:43,800
Tsubaki-san,

402
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,460
you're still in training, aren't you?

403
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:50,080
There is only one person
I will follow at all times.

404
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,960
Only the Grand Master

405
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:53,860
is not to be told what to do.

406
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,340
The head of Kougetsuan is the Grand Master.

407
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,840
You have no right.

408
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,080
You are right, Tomioka-san.

409
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,120
- Get back to work!
- Yes!

410
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:20,120
Darn it!

411
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,460
Tsubaki.

412
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,560
How dare you use your
precious hand so carelessly?

413
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,540
Did your grandfather send you?

414
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,880
What are you talking about?

415
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:43,820
I have a request.

416
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,600
I want to be in charge of the kitchen.

417
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,380
I think I'm beginning to lose my mind too.

418
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,620
I think we talked about this yesterday.

419
00:23:55,280 --> 00:23:56,920
The transfer of authority is

420
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:00,640
only those who officially take over the shop.

421
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:06,260
Only those who can use the tools
that lie there now.

422
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,040
I can't give it to you.

423
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:14,560
Um...

424
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,420
Nao, I think?

425
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:23,500
You know you're going to be with Tsubaki, don't you?

426
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,720
Tsubaki will not take over the Kougetsuan.

427
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:33,380
He's not my real grandchild.

428
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:36,760
Eh?

429
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:02,920
Oh, it's beautiful!

430
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,540
120 years ago,

431
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,040
Kougetsuan once suffered
a serious financial setback.

432
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:12,300
It was a way of making manju,
a speciality of the time.

433
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,860
It was stolen by the apprentice.

434
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,720
The apprentice opened a new shop of his own.

435
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,240
Kougetsuan is no longer able to make manju.

436
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:24,960
Then,

437
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:29,300
at Kougetsuan, we value blood above all else.

438
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:32,800
(Takatsuki Family Family tree)
We have decided never to give up the shop to anyone else.

439
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:37,760
It's became the guardian of the shop
as if it were a golden rule.

440
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,320
This tool is a symbol of that.

441
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,520
Tools are the soul of the craftsman.

442
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,620
Only those who officially take over the shop.

443
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,500
It's handed down from generation to generation.

444
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,080
It's been 15 years.

445
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,700
This tool has no one to use it.

446
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,080
Sleeping here.

447
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,520
15 years...

448
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:11,860
Tsubaki!

449
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:17,980
What do you mean you're not
your grandfather's real grandchild?

450
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,620
A child born of the landlady's infidelity.

451
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,420
That's what he thinks.

452
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:28,820
You're a liar!

453
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:32,260
You don't belong in this house.

454
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:33,480
Get out!

455
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:37,500
Nonsense.

456
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,700
What's the point of blood ties?

457
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:45,560
The important thing is passion for wagashi.

458
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,460
Nice, isn't it? Tsubaki.

459
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,220
Someday you'll take over this shop.

460
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:51,700
Yes.

461
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,680
I promised.

462
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,660
This shop,

463
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,800
I'll never give it to anyone.

464
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,400
Tsubaki is really trying to protect this shop.

465
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:20,060
He's serious about sweets.

466
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,780
- Look!
- it's beautiful!

467
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:27,700
Is it still the same Tsubaki I know?

468
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,240
Then, Tsubaki from that day...

469
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,640
That was Sakura's mother.

470
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:39,080
Did you really see my mother, by any chance?

471
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:42,420
Nao!

472
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,420
Jojima-kun.

473
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:45,900
I heard a noise.

474
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,700
What's the matter with you? It's so late.

475
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:48,460
Uhm.

476
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:52,320
I can do it from after 10pm until morning,
when the shop is finished.

477
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:54,320
I thought I could use the kitchen in secret.

478
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,940
Why don't you just use the stock of bean paste
you cook in the shop?

479
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,820
I'll save it for tomorrow so I don't get caught.

480
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,140
No, it's not good.

481
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:01,920
It'll be ok.

482
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:04,520
He doesn't know how much is in 20 sachets.

483
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,740
And Nao-san,

484
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,740
you want to still be in this shop right?

485
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,000
Here.

486
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,180
As "azukis, the healing companion".

487
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,100
Jojima-kun.

488
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,460
Kyoko-san.

489
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,160
It's not good enough to be in the house.

490
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:40,640
Well.

491
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,160
That's not so bad, is it?

492
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:46,520
Hurry up and give me a new shop.

493
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,200
That's disgusting.

494
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,020
Tomioka-san.

495
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,480
You startled me!

496
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,500
Can I have my kitchen back?

497
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:05,320
What? Why not?

498
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:09,780
Is it cheating to use the
bean paste made in the shop?

499
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:13,240
No, I thought it was a waste of time.

500
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,460
You don't get the chance to make
so many red bean paste.

501
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,900
When I think about it,

502
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:20,120
I've ever been so excited about anything.

503
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,220
I forgot how I feel.

504
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,600
I'm ashamed of myself.

505
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:28,400
I'm trying to be a craftsman.

506
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,340
Why did you become a sweet maker, Jojima?

507
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,720
My family owns a wagashi shop.

508
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,320
"Shimaya" is a small shop in Noto.

509
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:39,040
I'm here to train.

510
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:43,040
So I have to be on your own as soon as possible
to reassure my parents.

511
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,660
The heir to a wagashi shop?

512
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:47,180
Haha, we're not that big of a deal.

513
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,640
Jojima-kun,

514
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,160
you got bean paste in your hair.

515
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,080
Really? Where?

516
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,640
Oh...

517
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:59,680
When did this happen?

518
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,340
Wait a minute, there's another one.

519
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,640
What? Wait.

520
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:06,600
Oh, sorry.

521
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:07,820
Sorry.

522
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,440
That's my wife.

523
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:16,380
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

524
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,020
Thank you, Jojima-kun.

525
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,760
You've become very close.

526
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:33,460
Nothing like that...

527
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:39,020
Oh? What was that?

528
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,340
Jealousy?

529
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:44,900
What was that?

530
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:45,780
Nothing.

531
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,520
I'm concentrating on the bean jam!

532
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:54,060
I thought...

533
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:55,940
Eh?

534
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,360
I thought you are going to leave.

535
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:01,400
When you know
I wasn't the official heir to the business.

536
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,360
Honestly, I think you've lost
interest in marrying me.

537
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:12,120
I don't want Shirafujiya-san
to hate Japanese sweets.

538
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,000
I don't want it to end like that.

539
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,400
And bean paste is my passion.

540
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,020
Passion?

541
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,320
When I was little, I had a favourite picture book.

542
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,320
I liked to have my parents read to me.

543
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:32,840
"The second time, the goat, the rattler..."

544
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,840
Whenever I ask, no matter how busy she is.

545
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,840
She found time to read it to me.

546
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:41,180
But not when I was making the bean paste.

547
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:45,700
She would never leave the bean jam.

548
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,220
I stared at it for a long time.

549
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:52,120
Were your parents craftsmen, too?

550
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:01,440
At home, she just made it for me sometimes.

551
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,280
But...

552
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,780
She must have been a maker
of delicious bean paste.

553
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:15,080
The temperature at the time of
making the bean paste.

554
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:17,880
The taste depends very much that moment.

555
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,240
The emotions of the maker also have connection.

556
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,840
It'd show if it's made when the maker's angry or sad.

557
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:29,940
It's a mirror of yourself.

558
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,420
"A reflection of yourself...".

559
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:40,060
That's why when I make red bean paste.

560
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,420
I feel a bit worried.

561
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:46,000
Tsubaki.

562
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:50,040
Ah...prepare a jug of water.

563
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:51,920
Yes.

564
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,480
The red beans are mashed just right.

565
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,620
Amount of sugar is good.

566
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,180
It has a good moistness.

567
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:19,500
The perfect Kougetsuan bean paste.

568
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:22,160
Oh, thank goodness!

569
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,940
But something is missing.

570
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:26,300
Eh?

571
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,800
You don't think Kougetsuan's
bean paste is good, do you?

572
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:32,820
Why?

573
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:36,260
You know? "Red bean paste is a mirror of yourself".

574
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:40,180
The bean paste you think is really good,

575
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,300
go ahead and make it.

576
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:52,800
What does it mean?

577
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,820
She's using the kitchen like she owns the place.

578
00:33:55,820 --> 00:33:57,460
Well, that's all right.

579
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:58,840
Besides,

580
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,880
it's about my shop.

581
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:04,020
You'll have to take care of that yourself!

582
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,360
You're really useless.

583
00:34:11,160 --> 00:34:13,900
Kougetsuan's monaka is made of
glutinous rice and moistened.

584
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,120
It's cooked slight, isn't it?

585
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:19,200
So make the beans a little looser to crush.

586
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,460
It would be good to retain more of
the texture of the beans.

587
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:25,680
Plus, we use good beans, so they're not too sweet.

588
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:27,240
Bring out the true flavour!

589
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,680
Not too sweet?

590
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,040
You could also use honey.

591
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:35,400
I want to use that as a secret ingredient!

592
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:55,960
It's done.

593
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,100
(Kougetsu)

594
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:15,360
How is it?

595
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:17,840
For Shirafujiya-san,

596
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,040
I'll bring this monaka.

597
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,280
Are you sure?

598
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:26,700
Do you know what's absolute in this world?

599
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,540
I mean "delicious".

600
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,120
(Kofuku)
Oh my god, you are really here.

601
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:43,020
I thought you had given up.

602
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,860
My apologies for the delay.

603
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,480
We are very proud of monaka that we have made.

604
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:54,840
(Monaka / Kougetsu)

605
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,000
(Monaka / Kougetsu)
Bon appetit.

606
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:03,840
This...

607
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,680
Did you really make this?

608
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,140
How is it?

609
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:09,420
This monaka.

610
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,820
No change at all.

611
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:17,920
The taste of Kougetsuan's monaka
that we used to have.

612
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:19,480
No change?

613
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,980
I don't think that's possible...

614
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,980
That's what I thought.

615
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:27,600
May I ?

616
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,280
Go ahead.

617
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:30,440
Bon appetit.

618
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,140
How it can be?

619
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:41,560
Shirafujiya-san,

620
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:44,840
you've never ordered monaka before, right?

621
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,320
I've been looking back at the past orders.

622
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,000
All orders,

623
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:53,060
never for monaka.

624
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,200
So I thought.

625
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,040
Something happened suddenly
that made Shirafujiya-san

626
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,020
want to have Kougetsuan's monaka.

627
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:04,740
Maybe you want something
exactly the same as at the shop.

628
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,420
To go with tea,

629
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:10,220
the taste is unchanged.

630
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,420
That kind of sweet.

631
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:14,200
Eh, that's right.

632
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,600
That really is.

633
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,680
It's been a long time since I've had one of these.

634
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:25,840
It's so good!

635
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,060
Kougetsuan's sweets.

636
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,940
I always want it for many years.

637
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:35,340
Thank you very much.

638
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,700
The couple's wedding kimono.

639
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,220
We would be delighted
if you could tailor one for you.

640
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:42,020
By all means.

641
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,340
I didn't take the new monaka with me.

642
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:50,460
Are you angry?

643
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,640
"Bean paste is a mirror of yourself.",

644
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:58,000
Tsubaki-san said to me.

645
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:04,160
I was certainly confident in that bean paste.

646
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,620
There was a lot of selfishness on my part.

647
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,640
What Shirafujiya-san really wants is

648
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,640
the usual Kougetsuan taste.

649
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,860
Tsubaki-san made me realise that.

650
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,060
As the result,

651
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,060
your decision was the right one.

652
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,800
I have no right to say anything.

653
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,040
Just...

654
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:31,160
Why wasn't there a word of discussion?

655
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:32,920
I'm pissed off, though.

656
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:37,960
Did you want to feel superior to me,
watching me get impatient?

657
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:40,480
I thought you'd disagree if I said otherwise.

658
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,660
Don't decide by yourself.

659
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:43,700
You'll do it. In the end, it'll be replaced.

660
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:53,060
This is what the wedding is like.

661
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,220
Shirafujiya-san is out of her mind, isn't she?

662
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:00,760
That's right.

663
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:06,980
Let's do it.

664
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,300
Once a married couple.

665
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:30,180
It's just a game.

666
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:34,660
I'm not nervous.

667
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:42,600
Sensei, who is that girl?

668
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:45,920
From her mother.

669
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:48,320
She was a very skilled wagashi maker.

670
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,460
What a cute kimono date!

671
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,520
Yes, I'm jealous.

672
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,480
They look like a couple or lovers in this thing.

673
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,300
It's so easy.

674
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:18,820
Those things never change.

675
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:22,400
I hold hands with you because I love you.

676
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:26,040
It's a relief because that will never change.

677
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:30,560
Maybe that's what Kougetsuan's
bean paste is all about.

678
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:35,700
Neh, why don't you have a proper talk
with the Grand Master?

679
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,700
Maybe you can understand each other.

680
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:39,700
You.

681
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,740
You're really a simple thinker.

682
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,060
Tsubaki.

683
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:11,380
Shirafujiya-san...

684
00:41:11,980 --> 00:41:15,620
I heard that you've brought some
traditional Kougetsuan's monaka.

685
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:29,640
Why are you at the family dinner table?

686
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:31,640
I called her.

687
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,520
We have not lost faith in Shirafujiya-san.

688
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:37,720
It's thanks to her.

689
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,920
We have to respect her.

690
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:47,400
It's been long time.

691
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:53,640
It's so nice to have someone around the table.

692
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:57,560
I'm happy because I've been alone for so long.

693
00:41:58,520 --> 00:41:59,560
Today we are celebrating.

694
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:02,580
Bring me some sake. Tsubaki.

695
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:03,340
Yes.

696
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:11,020
Can Nao-san make Rakugan?

697
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:12,180
Yes.

698
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,560
Not quite yet, though.

699
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,420
Rakugan is a delicate disease.

700
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:20,300
It can easily fall apart
with the slightest force.

701
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:22,340
I think it is a skillful technique.

702
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,100
You know much.

703
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,020
I like rakugan.

704
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:29,700
The ingredients and preparation are simple.

705
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:32,760
This is why craftsmanship must have a sense.

706
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,960
It's all about beauty in a grain.

707
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:42,040
But Tsubaki says he's going to
take Rakugan off the shelves.

708
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:44,840
He said it was not selling well.

709
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:46,840
It's a silly idea.

710
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,160
He's got nothing.

711
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:55,380
The pride of the craftsman and
the love of wagashi.

712
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:59,780
He's stupid and helpless.

713
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:03,280
I don't think so.

714
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,020
Tsubaki-san is

715
00:43:07,300 --> 00:43:08,740
as good as the Grand Master.

716
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:11,260
He appreciates this shop.

717
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:15,940
About Tsubaki,

718
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:18,900
do you love him?

719
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:21,660
Yes.

720
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:25,620
Right.

721
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,020
Love?

722
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:30,880
Uhm.

723
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:34,620
Don't lie to me!

724
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:39,960
You say you're getting married,
but you have separate rooms.

725
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:42,700
I'm not going to be fooled!

726
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:45,520
One more,

727
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,340
there were two women who came into the house.

728
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:52,660
One of them is

729
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:54,680
this vixen.

730
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:56,940
Betrayed her son,

731
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,860
she left behind a child
whom had no blood relationship.

732
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,060
Tsubaki is really with that person...

733
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:03,800
Shut up!

734
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:05,800
The other one is...

735
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:09,840
She came in as a craftsman.

736
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:13,040
That woman,

737
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:16,920
she took the life of my son.

738
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:20,100
That was Sakura's mother.

739
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:23,720
You are...

740
00:44:24,020 --> 00:44:28,540
What do you want to take away from me?

741
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:38,180
Please don't bully my wife.

742
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:40,700
Tsubaki-san,

743
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:42,700
what are you doing to your grandfather?

744
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:49,960
Come to my room.

745
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:54,500
I'll be sharing a room with Nao from this night.

746
00:44:55,180 --> 00:44:56,500
And you're not complaining?

747
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:58,280
Let's go.

748
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,100
How can you make people happy?

749
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,360
I've always been opposed to marriage.

750
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:22,840
I was hesitant.

751
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:24,940
But,

752
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,680
I'm glad you approve.

753
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:33,860
Thank you, Grandfather.

754
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:52,220
That woman took the life of my son.

755
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:57,000
I'm sorry, I couldn't say anything back.

756
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:05,500
Your luggage.

757
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,100
That's really not much.

758
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:10,100
Uhm.

759
00:46:18,660 --> 00:46:19,900
(To Nao)

760
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:25,340
(Dear Nao, I didn't do it.)

761
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:28,040
I'm sorry.

762
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:32,520
I suggested you to have
a talk with the Grand Master

763
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:35,700
without consideration.

764
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,160
I'm so sorry.

765
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:53,400
Hmm...hey!

766
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,360
The Grand Master is not here.

767
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,860
We don't need these things.

768
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:03,800
Huh...what is it?

769
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:06,920
I thought that's what you meant, didn't it?

770
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:09,600
Sorry about that.

771
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,260
What are you upset about?

772
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:17,940
I...

773
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:39,920
This room is surprisingly small.

774
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,460
It hasn't changed since I was a kid.

775
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:48,500
Back then, to meet Tsubaki
I'd been hiding in this room.

776
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:51,240
Nao?

777
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:53,600
You're Sakura.

778
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:01,060
The seven Sakura.

779
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:04,540
You meant about the kanji?

780
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:09,900
There was once a girl in this house named Sakura.

781
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:12,780
This is where we used to make sweets together.

782
00:48:14,140 --> 00:48:16,320
I remember it. Tsubaki also does.

783
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:18,320
How was she like?

784
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:20,920
Quiet...

785
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:24,980
She was a crybaby.

786
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:29,400
But in this dark house...

787
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:33,360
She was the only light.

788
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:43,980
You...

789
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:52,660
It's the hand of the solar hill.

790
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:55,840
When we first met

791
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:58,940
If these hands were next to mine,

792
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:02,900
I thought it would change something.

793
00:49:06,420 --> 00:49:09,460
A woman who agrees to marry
a man she's never met before...

794
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:12,420
I thought she'd just use it.

795
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,840
A woman who only wants the sign of this shop...

796
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:17,560
It's the same as before.

797
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:24,460
Why are you...?

798
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:28,800
Tsubaki-san cares about this shop.

799
00:49:32,120 --> 00:49:33,280
You're crazy.

800
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:37,680
Tsubaki.

801
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:43,520
No!

802
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:47,220
But I can't.

803
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:58,480
What made me different from when I was a child

804
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:01,960
was Tsubaki.

805
00:50:06,300 --> 00:50:10,260
The person I hate most in this wolrd.

806
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:13,780
I hate you.

807
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:19,380
I hate him but...

808
00:50:21,100 --> 00:50:23,680
So you looked into it?

809
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:26,420
About her background?

810
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:29,660
(Survey Report)
(Detective Agency)

811
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:37,900
(Hanaoka[Maiden name: Okura] Nao)

812
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:55,860
Tsubaki!

813
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:04,260
If Sakura shows up in front of you,

814
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:07,260
what would you do?

815
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:12,760
If Sakura shows up in front of me?

816
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:19,120
I'll make her disappear.

817
00:51:21,840 --> 00:51:23,080
From my world.

818
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:25,320
Forever.

819
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:34,350
(Preview)
I can't let him know about Sakura.

820
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:36,740
(Doubt)
Let me wear it for you.

821
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:38,660
(Doubt)
Why did you agree to marry me?

822
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:40,660
Wait! Who is that?

823
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:42,660
Are you Hanaoka Nao?

824
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:44,660
(Will the real identity be revealed?)
Or are you Sakura?

825
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:46,500
Tsubaki! Tsubaki!
