Don't you really know...

6
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:00,730
why I joined SOLUTION?

7
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:12,369
Don't get distracted, Sa Ra.

8
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,350
Fine.

9
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,490
Then you shouldn't get distracted too.

10
00:01:46,069 --> 00:01:47,110
Let's just go.

(Divorce Specialist SOLUTION)

12
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:05,990
You...

13
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:08,059
used me first.

14
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,370
What did you want to show to Noh Yul Seong?

15
00:02:14,169 --> 00:02:15,539
I must make him more anxious...

16
00:02:17,139 --> 00:02:20,509
if I want to find out why he's so bothered by us.

17
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:28,049
I never used you.

18
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:45,829
You could have had your pick of the job.

19
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,899
But I was curious why you chose this place of all the offers.

20
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,940
That's true.

21
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,169
Despite that, I chose to join SOLUTION.

22
00:02:54,009 --> 00:02:55,810
- The reason behind my decision... - I didn't know...

23
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,310
that reason was Noh Yul Seong.

24
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:05,049
You found out about the five-member society while working here.

25
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,620
So working here paid off, did it not?

26
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,160
Kim Sa Ra.

27
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:11,829
Is that...

28
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:15,400
all I amount to in your eyes?

29
00:03:18,269 --> 00:03:19,930
I need you to take a break from the team.

30
00:03:21,699 --> 00:03:23,799
I finally understand why you wanted me to give you...

31
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,039
three months.

32
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:26,270
Kim Sa Ra!

33
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:30,498
Hey, get a grip.

34
00:04:30,499 --> 00:04:32,868
Let me tell you something. That jerk is a total nutcase.

35
00:04:32,869 --> 00:04:34,938
Remember the case where a professor jumped off? He's using you,

36
00:04:34,939 --> 00:04:37,179
so he can find evidence to avoid taking responsibility for it.

37
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:41,979
What's so awful about being used?

38
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,090
I wouldn't mind being used by him.

39
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:55,900
How's Chayul Town going?

40
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:59,700
I get that you're curious about how much we know.

41
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,070
But don't make it so obvious.

42
00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:02,669
It makes you look small.

43
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:20,350
I never used you.

Professor Seo.

48
00:05:50,379 --> 00:05:51,390
Come in.

49
00:05:52,989 --> 00:05:54,589
It's about the law-school-related law.

50
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:55,919
The Legislation and Judiciary Committee passed it.

51
00:05:57,789 --> 00:05:59,428
Could they have bribed the committee?

52
00:05:59,429 --> 00:06:00,629
Only the plenary session remains now.

53
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:03,329
- How likely is it to get passed? - Assemblymen's opinions are split.

54
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,428
That must be why Noh Yul Seong is trying badly to grease...

55
00:06:05,429 --> 00:06:06,700
the leaders of Hanjoo Party.

56
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:09,270
So he'll use the votes of the majority party?

57
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:13,410
Kim Young A, the party representative of Hanjoo Party?

58
00:06:14,369 --> 00:06:16,309
Didn't you say you guys have the same spa membership?

59
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:19,010
We do. Why do you ask?

60
00:06:21,249 --> 00:06:24,689
I must stop Noh Yul Seong from turning into a dinosaur.

61
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:29,059
I still can't see my son when he's only an elephant now.

62
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:31,330
Should I find out when she comes for spa?

63
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:33,729
Only the members are allowed inside, right?

64
00:06:33,929 --> 00:06:37,830
First of all, I need to cross paths with her at least once.

65
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:42,499
You know, let's fix your makeup, so you look a bit older.

66
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:45,239
Pretend you're me, and go in. Here you go.

67
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,010
Thank you.

68
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,410
It's a VIP card.

69
00:06:57,679 --> 00:06:58,749
Hello.

70
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,289
I'm a fan.

71
00:07:01,559 --> 00:07:02,619
Thank you.

72
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:08,659
Please run for President in the next election.

73
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,660
Gosh.

74
00:07:10,629 --> 00:07:12,799
- Sure. - By the way,

75
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:15,868
aren't you from the divorce...

76
00:07:15,869 --> 00:07:18,910
Gosh, what an honour. You know who I am.

77
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,209
My name is Kim Sa Ra.

78
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:22,978
You destroyed Candidate Noh Yul Seong to pieces.

79
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:24,009
Of course, I remember you.

80
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,079
I always wanted to meet you someday.

81
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,450
I got my wish, I guess.

82
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,080
I'll let you rest now.

83
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,220
I have a question. Do you also assist people...

84
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,760
in preventing a divorce?

85
00:07:41,499 --> 00:07:44,099
Sang Hee. Is your campaign for class president going well?

86
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,169
Yes.

87
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:46,869
How come you're not even touching the tofu?

88
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,868
She activated her eyes on the back of her head again.

89
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:50,738
I know you're trying to lose weight.

90
00:07:50,739 --> 00:07:52,209
But if you don't consume enough protein,

91
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:53,470
your bones will break. Here.

92
00:07:54,369 --> 00:07:56,640
If I keep consuming protein like this, I'll be a muscular pig.

93
00:08:04,689 --> 00:08:06,820
Sang Hoon. Have a good day at school.

94
00:08:07,049 --> 00:08:08,759
- Have a good day. - Thanks.

95
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,859
Hey.

96
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:13,058
- I need a moment. - I'm running late.

97
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:14,129
Just a moment.

(Uncontested Divorce Agreement)

99
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:21,969
Must you do this now when you know I have a busy morning?

100
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:24,070
How many times must I tell you?

101
00:08:24,239 --> 00:08:26,168
I was told that our family and politics don't mix.

102
00:08:26,169 --> 00:08:27,469
It will bring a flood of misfortunes.

103
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:28,710
Honey. How could you...

104
00:08:28,939 --> 00:08:31,580
Are you doing this because you actually believe that?

105
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,350
What's the harm in taking the advice?

106
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,649
Seriously. How come you can't see it?

107
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:36,819
Get a grip.

108
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:37,878
If that's the reason,

109
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:39,119
that's all the more reason I cannot agree to this divorce.

110
00:08:40,749 --> 00:08:41,759
Honey.

111
00:08:42,119 --> 00:08:43,389
That's the situation I am in.

112
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,859
I was looking into setting up a meeting with you.

113
00:08:47,129 --> 00:08:48,559
I guess telepathy could be real.

114
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,398
(The generation-changing Hanjoo Party of the nation)

115
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,430
Thank you.

116
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,070
Let's hear it.

117
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,509
Tell me why you came to see me at the spa.

118
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:03,580
Where do you stand on increasing the number of law schools?

119
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:07,609
You really hate Mr. Noh Yul Seong, don't you?

120
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,790
I can pay you the bonus after everything, right?

121
00:09:12,749 --> 00:09:14,090
Yes. Of course.

122
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:16,889
Let me say this again.

123
00:09:17,889 --> 00:09:20,060
My husband is asking me for a divorce.

124
00:09:20,859 --> 00:09:21,959
(Hanjoo Party)

125
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,299
You wouldn't want to go through a divorce,

126
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,199
since getting reelected...

127
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,970
as the party representative would become harder then, right?

128
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,940
No. It's because of my children.

129
00:09:32,109 --> 00:09:33,310
Sang Hee and Sang Hoon.

130
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,009
They are from my husband's previous marriage.

131
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:37,909
I see.

132
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,449
They may not be my biological children, but I can proudly say...

133
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:42,080
that I am their mother.

134
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,920
In a divorce, it'd be difficult for me to get custody, wouldn't it?

135
00:09:46,489 --> 00:09:47,790
Legally, yes.

136
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:49,159
That's why...

137
00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:54,859
I cannot divorce him.

138
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,300
You all read the message, right?

139
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,709
Isn't this the first case where we have to stop a divorce?

140
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:08,439
I'm all for this kind of case.

141
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:10,378
We just kill at what we do.

142
00:10:10,379 --> 00:10:12,979
It doesn't mean our job is to kill every divorce.

143
00:10:13,479 --> 00:10:15,849
Let's gather all the materials and talk at the conference table.

144
00:10:15,850 --> 00:10:16,920
- Okay. - Okay.

145
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:22,589
Hello. You're here. Let's start the briefing then.

146
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,290
He's going to sit this one out.

147
00:10:24,489 --> 00:10:26,329
What? Why?

148
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:27,459
Is something wrong?

149
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,930
- Well... - He has a lot of his own cases too.

150
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,200
Let's work on this one without him.

151
00:10:32,769 --> 00:10:35,239
But I still need to be in the loop regarding the overall outline.

152
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,570
I'll attend the briefing.

153
00:10:39,869 --> 00:10:41,269
Kim Young A, the party representative of Hanjoo Party.

154
00:10:42,479 --> 00:10:43,539
As an IT specialist,

155
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,350
she was the CEO of a search engine in her 30s.

156
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:47,478
Seven years ago, she married...

157
00:10:47,479 --> 00:10:50,079
the CEO of Yerim Distribution, Yoo Min Chul, at a late age.

158
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,219
Their conflict has gotten serious lately...

159
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,420
regarding her political career.

160
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:54,018
As her husband's company is about to get listed,

161
00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:55,488
he's pushing for a divorce now.

162
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:57,618
If he were to get a divorce after the company gets listed,

163
00:10:57,619 --> 00:10:59,758
there would be more assets to divide during the divorce.

164
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,358
So he must want to get it done before that.

165
00:11:01,359 --> 00:11:03,829
When they got married, if she adopted his children,

166
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,228
that would be grounds to demand child custody. Did she do that?

167
00:11:06,229 --> 00:11:07,229
She must have missed that.

168
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:10,499
Then they would be strangers if the divorce gets processed.

169
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,170
Let's meet with the husband first.

170
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,279
- Security is our priority on this. - Yes, ma'am.

171
00:11:27,749 --> 00:11:29,989
Are the bottoms of your feet okay?

172
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:37,330
You had crossed a desert.

173
00:11:37,629 --> 00:11:39,430
But there's no water in your fortune.

174
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,040
So what do you think? The bottoms of your feet must be on fire.

175
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:46,070
Life must have been tough on you.

176
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:50,539
If you gather the energy of the universe together,

177
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:53,749
the desert may turn into a meadow.

178
00:11:54,249 --> 00:11:55,249
Hallelujah.

179
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:59,589
The pupils and whites of your eyes are clear. So you are bright.

180
00:11:59,590 --> 00:12:02,388
Your nose is straight like a riverbank where water flows.

181
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:06,529
But your philtrum is deep. So you will drink up all the water.

182
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:09,560
You and the energy of the universe...

183
00:12:09,859 --> 00:12:15,040
are bound to be in conflict by nature.

184
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:17,868
Hallelujah.

185
00:12:17,869 --> 00:12:18,909
Amen.

186
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:22,909
Sir. Did you ask for a divorce...

187
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,850
based on the pastor's fortune reading?

188
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,320
It's not fortune reading. It's the energy of the universe.

189
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,118
I understand why this may seem a bit odd...

190
00:12:30,119 --> 00:12:31,249
from the eyes of worldly beings.

191
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:32,789
But do not be rude to him.

192
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,449
Excuse me. We just met,

193
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:36,258
but judging her based on her facial features is also bad manners.

194
00:12:36,259 --> 00:12:38,628
Why don't you show them your psychokinesis?

195
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:42,129
They will need a reason to back out of the case too.

196
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,800
Young lady.

197
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:50,898
These coins are engraved with the 12 zodiac animals.

198
00:12:50,899 --> 00:12:51,908
Choose one.

199
00:12:51,909 --> 00:12:56,009
Then the pastor will make the coin of your choice fly in the air.

200
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,050
You must experience his superpower to believe it.

201
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:01,920
Why must I experience it?

202
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:04,648
It says so on your face.

203
00:13:04,649 --> 00:13:06,989
"How could you ask for a divorce based on what he said?"

204
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:09,358
Let's stop here.

205
00:13:09,359 --> 00:13:11,489
There are people who doubt the truth of the universe.

206
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:17,060
Please forgive their sin. Hallelujah.

207
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,159
Amen.

208
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:26,040
Anyway, Ms. Kim will not agree to a divorce...

209
00:13:26,369 --> 00:13:28,239
unless you give her child custody.

210
00:13:31,379 --> 00:13:32,609
I will divorce her.

211
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:35,479
Tell her to sign the paper quietly before this turns into a big deal.

212
00:13:36,979 --> 00:13:38,019
Hallelujah.

213
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,889
Is this called the Magnet Religion?

214
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,729
How could he fall for a cult like that?

215
00:13:46,729 --> 00:13:50,100
It will be harder for Ms. Kim to leave the children with him.

216
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,229
It feels like we have two targets with this case.

217
00:13:52,529 --> 00:13:54,600
The husband and the pastor he is influenced by.

218
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,040
Let's dig into that pastor...

219
00:13:58,239 --> 00:13:59,769
and find out about what kind of man he is.

220
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:24,529
It will be a holiday soon.

221
00:14:25,629 --> 00:14:27,129
Hang in there, ma'am.

222
00:14:40,779 --> 00:14:42,749
You didn't get the cell phone back from Chayul Law Firm, right?

223
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:43,950
No. Not yet.

224
00:14:47,249 --> 00:14:49,460
You knew Chayul Law Firm had it.

225
00:14:51,989 --> 00:14:53,330
Professor Seo...

226
00:14:54,489 --> 00:14:58,529
was in the five-member society Noh Yul Seong established.

227
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:00,628
What's that?

228
00:15:00,629 --> 00:15:02,239
On the surface, they were working to found a law school.

229
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:04,268
But they were a private group,

230
00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:05,840
looking to score future profits from real estate development.

231
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:08,269
It is my opinion that...

232
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:11,180
the five-member society had something to do with why he jumped.

233
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:15,850
Haven't you done enough, putting him in this condition?

234
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,519
Are you going to accuse him of being a criminal now?

235
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:20,350
Please leave.

236
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:26,359
Okay.

237
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,300
Fine.

238
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,908
You can curse me out and call me a prosecutor...

239
00:15:41,909 --> 00:15:43,479
who only cared about making my case.

240
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:49,950
Sometimes, it makes me wonder if that's who I had been.

241
00:15:50,479 --> 00:15:51,820
That does cross my mind.

242
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:54,820
But let me check Professor Seo's cell phone.

243
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,159
I will find the real reason behind his decision to jump.

244
00:16:12,009 --> 00:16:13,639
Well, you had me scared for some time now.

245
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:16,608
I requested to meet with you for a while.

246
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:19,879
But our meeting kept getting delayed.

247
00:16:20,249 --> 00:16:22,019
Once the law regarding law schools get amended,

248
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:24,519
there would be three new law schools.

249
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:26,320
I heard that your law firm played...

250
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:29,059
a huge role when it was presented to the LJC.

251
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,388
(Hanjoo Party)

252
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:33,358
You want to get down to business. I see.

253
00:16:33,359 --> 00:16:34,359
This is great.

254
00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:38,359
If you help the law get passed in the plenary session,

255
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:40,670
I will pay my own money...

256
00:16:40,729 --> 00:16:42,800
to build the town for law schools.

257
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:46,268
If these law schools can serve...

258
00:16:46,269 --> 00:16:48,809
as a tool in revitalizing the regional economy,

259
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:50,378
you will be taking all the credit.

260
00:16:50,379 --> 00:16:53,050
You can count on that, of course.

261
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:56,680
Then it only makes sense that Chayul Law Firm takes...

262
00:16:57,249 --> 00:16:58,889
one of the new law schools.

263
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:02,920
That's too bad. You see,

264
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:06,690
I don't join hands with people who have been...

265
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,629
awful to their spouses.

266
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:26,649
By the way, there's something between Ms. Kim and Lawyer Dong.

267
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,820
What? That was so random.

268
00:17:30,179 --> 00:17:33,550
Seriously. You're so clueless. This is why you can't date men.

269
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:37,889
Lawyer Dong never had the intention of sitting this one out.

270
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:41,129
But Ms. Kim pushed him out on purpose.

271
00:17:41,899 --> 00:17:43,000
I bet she's playing hard-to-get.

272
00:17:44,429 --> 00:17:47,070
You must think there's a fling if two people establish eye contact.

273
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:48,769
You think we're all like you.

274
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:50,800
My hunches are scientifically proven.

275
00:17:51,199 --> 00:17:54,669
See? Our eyes meet all the time, but I never get confused.

276
00:17:55,139 --> 00:17:56,639
- Is that so? - Yes.

277
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,020
What?

278
00:18:08,419 --> 00:18:09,419
What is it?

279
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:14,990
Gosh. I wonder if Lawyer Dong needs any help from another guy.

280
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,530
He's coming out.

They're all his believers?

283
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:57,069
He must've extorted a lot of money...

284
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,639
to be able to build such a big church like this.

285
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,939
What is this? A rip off on Cheonji Dongsan?

286

He's known as the pastor...

294

who foresees the future and heals sick people.

295
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:24,659

Besides, he's famous for making accurate predictions...

regarding investments.

302
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,479
Back then, Yoo's company was struggling due to lack of funds.

303
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,819
But when he bought the stocks of the company the pastor pointed out,

304
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,148
he made a fortune.

305
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:46,789
He said his insomnia improved thanks to the psychic therapy.

306
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,149

Are there people with psychic powers like him in Korea too?

he would be in trouble without a divorce.

- Yes. - Don't.

Then how did the pastor treat his insomnia?

336

Maybe, it might be the placebo effect.

Right. It got better as much as his faith grew.

358
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:06,280
I'd say it was more than just knowing each other.

359
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,080
She was his girl?

360
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,590
Since when?

361
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:14,189
I'm not sure.

362
00:24:15,119 --> 00:24:18,019
Anyway, I saw her in a hotel...

363
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,689
at Noh Yul Seong's remarriage party.

364
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:22,830
That night, she died after falling off a taxi that was driving.

365
00:24:23,230 --> 00:24:24,429
There was an informant?

366
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,668
The police ended the case as a suicide.

367
00:24:26,669 --> 00:24:28,730
But there was an informant that claimed it wasn't a suicide.

368
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:30,638
But why didn't they conduct reinvestigation?

369
00:24:30,639 --> 00:24:32,510
She couldn't be reached after her call.

370
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,668
It sounded like a lady in her 60s.

371
00:24:34,669 --> 00:24:36,840
But there were no clues that led to her.

372
00:24:38,139 --> 00:24:40,909
Seo Woong Jin's death leap and Na Yu Mi's suicide.

373
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,979
Both cases don't seem quite right.

374
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,949
But in these two cases,

375
00:24:46,149 --> 00:24:48,919
Noh Yul Seong is involved.

376
00:24:49,159 --> 00:24:51,790
That was why I kept looking into these cases.

377
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:55,260
But Noh Yul Seong wasn't the reason I came to SOLUTION.

378
00:24:58,530 --> 00:24:59,699
It was Kim Sa Ra.

379
00:25:04,969 --> 00:25:07,168
We met after nine years.

380
00:25:07,169 --> 00:25:09,209
"Well, that's nice. I should use my ex to my advantage."

381
00:25:09,939 --> 00:25:11,240
Can you think that way?

382
00:25:12,379 --> 00:25:13,409
Yes.

383
00:25:13,949 --> 00:25:15,009
What?

384
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:16,320
I will do that from now on.

385
00:25:17,219 --> 00:25:18,279
Do what?

386
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:21,449
I finally see a way to send Noh Yul Seong to prison.

387
00:25:23,859 --> 00:25:25,159
I want to use you, Lawyer Dong.

388
00:25:26,330 --> 00:25:27,590
Let's use each other.

389
00:25:51,949 --> 00:25:53,719
Ms. Kim and Lawyer Dong got in a fight.

390
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:56,189
She sounded quite resolute about having Lawyer Dong out of a case.

391
00:25:57,889 --> 00:25:58,889
Really?

392
00:25:59,189 --> 00:26:00,929
It seems like you'll cry if they make up with each other.

393
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:04,158
What's going on? Do you still have feelings for your ex-wife?

394
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:06,230
Don't get ahead of yourself.

395
00:26:06,669 --> 00:26:07,800
Don't be taking things there.

396
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,869
Fine.

397
00:26:11,639 --> 00:26:15,010
Then is it too much to talk about Kim Young A?

398
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,810
I will if you stop frowning so much.

399
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,609
Hurry up and tell me.

400
00:26:21,909 --> 00:26:24,079
She came to SOLUTION to ask for help to stop her divorce.

401
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,080
Divorce?

402
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,259
Is she liable for anything?

403
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,260
Not at all.

404
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:33,030
The problem lies within the husband.

405
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:34,889
Amazingly, it has to do with a cult.

406
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,439
- Get off. - What?

407
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:46,938
Weren't you the one to call to ask me things?

408
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:48,339
You're right about that.

409
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,879
Get off for now. Wait for me.

410
00:27:12,929 --> 00:27:14,699
What's with the heavy steps?

411
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,669
Sorry? I'm fine.

412
00:27:17,899 --> 00:27:21,540
Was it because I mentioned the second floor to stay out of it?

413
00:27:21,909 --> 00:27:23,379
I hope it wasn't because of that.

414
00:27:23,879 --> 00:27:25,379
Oh, not at all.

415
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:28,250
It had nothing to do with you, Hui Jin.

416
00:27:28,379 --> 00:27:29,949
I was worried if you would get the wrong idea.

417
00:27:38,859 --> 00:27:40,790
Why are you worrying about me?

418
00:27:41,689 --> 00:27:43,260
We're in the same team.

419
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,709
You're going to push Kim Young A out?

420
00:27:58,209 --> 00:27:59,280
It's a mess there.

421
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,619
No pesticide will work.

422
00:28:02,719 --> 00:28:04,820
If that's the case, it's best to cut it out.

423
00:28:06,689 --> 00:28:07,719
What next?

424
00:28:08,149 --> 00:28:11,560
After her, the next representative is Ha Hyun Ho.

425
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:15,290
I need your help.

426
00:28:19,169 --> 00:28:20,399
You said you'll take care of things on your own.

427
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:24,369
But you're showing the white flag in just a week.

428
00:28:30,179 --> 00:28:32,240
I'm feeling embarrassed.

429
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,349
Your pesticides will surely work on Ha Hyun Ho.

430
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:35,709
One last time!

431
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:38,448
If you are to blame me one more time,

432
00:28:38,449 --> 00:28:41,090
not even a single sheet of paper from Chayul will be given to you.

433
00:28:44,189 --> 00:28:45,929
If you are to help out with that,

434
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:48,189
I will deal with Kim Young A.

435
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:08,409
Hello, Pastor Cheon.

436
00:29:09,109 --> 00:29:11,479
By the way, you're house is amazing.

437
00:29:11,480 --> 00:29:15,590
Oh, is CEO Yoo Min Chul's divorce going smoothly?

438
00:29:16,119 --> 00:29:17,189
Who are you?

439
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:19,020
Me?

440
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:22,760
I am someone who is looking in the same direction as you.

441
00:29:25,929 --> 00:29:28,128
Do you know Kim Young A well?

442
00:29:28,129 --> 00:29:29,368
Yes. She comes often.

443
00:29:29,369 --> 00:29:31,269
She came for both the party representative...

444
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,169
and presidential elections.

445
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:35,609
- Did you watch it? - We're watching it right now.

446
00:29:39,609 --> 00:29:40,980
Oh, right.

447
00:29:42,949 --> 00:29:45,218
Do you know Kim Young A well?

448
00:29:45,219 --> 00:29:46,688
Yes. She comes often.

449
00:29:46,689 --> 00:29:48,618
She came for both the party representative...

450
00:29:48,619 --> 00:29:50,489
and presidential elections.

451
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:51,888
Are you her mentor?

452
00:29:51,889 --> 00:29:53,888
That's it. A mentor.

453
00:29:53,889 --> 00:29:56,800
The higher a person goes, the lonelier they get.

454
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:59,368
Unexpectedly, she has no one around her.

455
00:29:59,369 --> 00:30:01,168
That is why I am here for her to give some advice.

456
00:30:01,169 --> 00:30:03,438
The part-timer of this place posted it up online.

457
00:30:03,439 --> 00:30:05,599
While going through the CCTV footage,

458
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,609
talks about a big name made the part-timer post it up.

459
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:15,750
Did your mom want steak this year?

460
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:19,050
Yes. I got the sign last night.

461
00:30:20,290 --> 00:30:22,419
- Enjoy your meal, Mom. - Let's dig in.

462
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,629
Only cooked vegetables.

463
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:30,658
A controlled diet is most important for your illness, Sang Hoon.

464
00:30:30,659 --> 00:30:31,730
I know.

465
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:33,898
What's the point of going through a controlled diet?

466
00:30:33,899 --> 00:30:34,929
Dad...

467
00:30:35,429 --> 00:30:38,369
I know your dad doesn't remember the anniversary of your mom's death.

468
00:30:38,639 --> 00:30:40,108
Don't feel too sad about it.

469
00:30:40,109 --> 00:30:41,638
He's super annoying.

470
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:43,010
Sang Hee, let's not get rude now.

471
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,080
Your brother might learn from you.

472
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:48,549
Look at what he's doing after hearing from a pastor...

473
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:49,919
that it'll bring bad luck to him.

474
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,480
Let's eat.

475
00:30:56,219 --> 00:30:57,219
Hey.

476
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,790
What?

477
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:01,830
That's it. A mentor.

478
00:31:02,959 --> 00:31:04,729
This pastor is totally crazy.

479
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:07,729
Mom, will you really get a divorce?

480
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:09,600
Gosh, are you kidding me?

481
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:11,800
Do you think I can live without you two?

482
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:13,409
Seriously?

483
00:31:20,949 --> 00:31:23,419
I will survive through this.

484
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:27,990
Don't get so worried. Okay?

485
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,889
CEO Yoo!

486
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:34,858
What are you thinking?

487
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:38,129
I just don't get why...

488
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:39,799
you said all those lies.

489
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,368
Haven't you heard of malicious editing?

490
00:31:41,369 --> 00:31:44,539
It's just making me look like I've said those things.

491
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,600
My gosh.

492
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,168
So that was it, right?

493
00:31:48,169 --> 00:31:49,310
Gosh.

494
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:56,850
What do I get from doing that?

495
00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:01,189
Your status will go up as a party representative mentor.

496
00:32:01,449 --> 00:32:03,718
Even if Kim Young A denies it,

497
00:32:03,719 --> 00:32:05,619
people will go with that idea.

498
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:13,230
Listen. Kim Young A...

499
00:32:13,429 --> 00:32:17,198
is taking away the cosmic energy within you.

500
00:32:17,199 --> 00:32:18,969
How many times have I told you this?

501
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,509
And yet, you're still struggling...

502
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:23,379
to get a divorce.

503
00:32:28,909 --> 00:32:30,479
- CEO Yoo. - Yes?

504
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,219
Are you acting this way to avoid making offerings?

505
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,490
Pastor Cheon!

506
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:39,289
After our company gets listed, it'll be Cheonji Dongsan's.

507
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,128
We must receive your great energy...

508
00:32:41,129 --> 00:32:43,000
and spread out through the world.

509
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:46,230
Hallelujah.

510
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:47,570
Hello.

511
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,299
Have you seen the video?

512
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,740
None of it is true. Talk with the secretary's office.

513
00:32:58,409 --> 00:33:00,809
(Member of the Supreme Council, Ha Hyun Ho)

514
00:33:00,810 --> 00:33:02,780
(Hanjoo Party)

515
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:07,149
I apologize for being late.

516
00:33:07,619 --> 00:33:09,989
Goodness. You're going through a lot.

517
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:12,589
Journalists love a bit of gossip, don't they?

518
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:14,559
But let's make things clear.

519
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,829
Are you sure you're not related to all that?

520
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:20,099
- Assemblyman Ha. - Well, if it isn't true,

521
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,868
you must deny this for the party's sake.

522
00:33:21,869 --> 00:33:23,000
Don't worry.

523
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:26,310
I am not a member of that cult.

524
00:33:26,969 --> 00:33:29,839
Great. Then everything's fine.

525
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:30,979
Make some time on the weekend with your husband.

526
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:33,080
Go to a big church or cathedral...

527
00:33:33,409 --> 00:33:36,149
and post up a picture of you praying.

528
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,449
That will sort things right away.

529
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:43,260
I feel so dumbfounded.

530
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,358
(The generation-changing Hanjoo Party of the nation)

531
00:33:44,359 --> 00:33:45,490
My husband says...

532
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,990
it's malicious editing.

533
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:49,698
Everyone on the Internet...

534
00:33:49,699 --> 00:33:52,230
is doxing the pastor of Cheonji Dongsan.

535
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:56,740
We can get by saying it's nonsense from the pastor.

536
00:33:56,869 --> 00:33:59,070
But if everyone finds out that your husband is a member,

537
00:33:59,669 --> 00:34:00,740
things will get much worse.

538
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,408
We don't have time.

539
00:34:03,409 --> 00:34:04,939
The rumours and the divorce.

540
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:08,409
These things will only get solved when your husband leaves that place.

541
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:20,130
Just a moment.

542
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:22,659
Me?

543
00:34:24,029 --> 00:34:25,029
Again?

544
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:30,099
Out of us, you're the only one the pastor doesn't know.

545
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,968
To get the husband out,

546
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:34,810
we have to make him know the pastor is a cult leader.

547
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:40,150
Why do you keep making me the inside man?

548
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,979
This still doesn't sound right.

549
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,979
Won't there be another way?

550
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:47,588
If we are to make him learn that the pastor is a swindler,

551
00:34:47,589 --> 00:34:49,318
this is the best way.

552
00:34:49,319 --> 00:34:53,189
Well, I may be good at everything else,

553
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:56,130
but acting is just not my thing.

554
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:59,129
You won't find a worse actor than me.

555
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:00,729
It's serious.

556
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:02,169
Let's find another way.

557
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:05,269
Lawyer Dong. It's a trend to have it all as a lawyer.

558
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:08,069
Have it all? I'm not interested.

559
00:35:10,009 --> 00:35:12,479
If someone like me ends up going,

560
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,610
everyone will find out.

561
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:15,980
Hi!

562
00:35:15,981 --> 00:35:18,849
Ms. Son. I don't really look like someone who is...

563
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:19,989
part of a cult, do I?

564
00:35:20,719 --> 00:35:23,218
There aren't specific faces to be a cult member.

565
00:35:23,219 --> 00:35:25,388
What is it? Why do you need me for this?

566
00:35:25,389 --> 00:35:28,829
Ms. Son, you said you dreamed of becoming an actress, right?

567
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:32,059
Yes. I have the perfect face and body. What a waste.

568
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,829
- Right? - Yes. Why do you ask?

569
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:37,540
Why don't you take this chance to live out your dream?

570
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:40,469
Two is better than one, isn't it? This looks great.

571
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:42,670
What?

572
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:44,339
Just say no.

573
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,579
What is it about?

574
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:48,908
Think carefully about this. Is this the best plan possible?

575
00:35:48,909 --> 00:35:49,920
- Yes! - Yes!

576
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:51,549
What plan?

577
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:53,019
Just say no.

578
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:54,349
Say no? No!

579
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:55,619
But what's the plan?

580
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:58,359
(Cheonji Dongsan)

581
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:01,159
Cheonji claimed this!

582
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,130
If you have faith,

583
00:36:05,799 --> 00:36:09,529
the mountains and seas can be moved!

584
00:36:10,069 --> 00:36:12,298
Believe in Cheonji...

585
00:36:12,299 --> 00:36:14,210
and miracles will occur!

586
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:17,080
Doubt Cheonji...

587
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:21,779
and all will fall into the fiery pit!

588
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,979
Hallelujah!

589
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:26,118
- Hallelujah! - Hallelujah!

590
00:36:26,119 --> 00:36:27,749
- Amen. - Hallelujah.

591
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:29,989
- Amen. - Amen.

592
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:33,329
Claims that I am...

593
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:35,559
a mentor of a famous politician...

594
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,360
are not important at all.

595
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:40,900
"Why so serious?"

596
00:36:43,799 --> 00:36:46,169
Even so, there are numerous...

597
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:48,209
poor and pitiful members who have come...

598
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:51,880
from all over the country.

599
00:36:52,239 --> 00:36:57,420
Cheonji will welcome you with love.

600
00:36:57,819 --> 00:36:58,979
Newcomers.

601
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:01,488
- Please stand up, newcomers. - Newcomers.

602
00:37:01,489 --> 00:37:03,790
- Yes. Stand up. - Please stand up for us.

603
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,529
- Newcomers? - We're newcomers.

604
00:37:07,759 --> 00:37:09,360
- Up we go. - I can't see at all.

605
00:37:10,429 --> 00:37:13,929
Who shall greet us as the representative?

606
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:16,400
Oh, the one with glasses.

607
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,239
You're the only man here.

608
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:19,940
Glasses?

609
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:23,339
Oh, right.

610
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:26,980
- Look natural. - Natural. Yes.

611
00:37:27,179 --> 00:37:30,520
Well, I have come with my sister...

612
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:34,119
who has lost her sight a few years ago...

613
00:37:35,089 --> 00:37:36,319
through an unknown illness.

614
00:37:39,219 --> 00:37:43,059
We have come to receive the blessing of Pastor Cheonji.

615
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:44,198
Hallelujah!

616
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:46,969
- Hallelujah! - Hallelujah!

617
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,540
Great.

618
00:37:50,639 --> 00:37:52,569
None of that is necessary!

619
00:37:52,869 --> 00:37:54,040
All you need is faith.

620
00:37:55,009 --> 00:37:57,338
- Faith alone. - This acting is more than terrible.

621
00:37:57,339 --> 00:38:01,778
With faith in Cheonji, the sister of the only man here...

622
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:05,019
a miracle will occur!

623
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:07,289
Hallelujah!

624
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:08,519
- Hallelujah! - Hallelujah!

625
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,460
- Hallelujah! - Hallelujah!

626
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:12,189
Amen!

627
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:14,158
- Amen! - Amen!

628
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:15,929
Please be seated.

629
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,100
Yes.

630
00:38:19,029 --> 00:38:20,029
Right.

631
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:23,440
(Cheonji Dongsan)

632
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:29,009
Look forward.

633
00:38:37,449 --> 00:38:39,150
Cheonji!

634
00:38:46,659 --> 00:38:48,130
Your faith...

635
00:38:48,389 --> 00:38:51,859
will receive cosmic energy!

636
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:54,298
It is through Pastor Cheonji.

637
00:38:54,299 --> 00:38:55,568
Who?

638
00:38:55,569 --> 00:38:58,169
- Pastor Cheonji! - Pastor Cheonji!

639
00:38:58,170 --> 00:38:59,170
Pastor Cheonji!

640
00:38:59,171 --> 00:39:01,710
Through Pastor Cheonji,

641
00:39:01,909 --> 00:39:04,809
this poor cancer patient...

642
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:08,310
will receive that energy!

643
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:09,979
Do you believe this?

644
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,349
- Yes! - Yes!

645
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:12,979
Do you believe this?

646
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,420
- Yes! - Yes!

647
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,969
We believe!

648
00:39:42,350 --> 00:39:45,279
(Cheonji Dongsan)

649
00:40:11,009 --> 00:40:12,009
Silence!

650
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:14,209
You may now...

651
00:40:14,210 --> 00:40:17,080
witness the evidence of this miracle.

652
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:28,888
This Pastor Cheonji has received cosmic energy...

653
00:40:28,889 --> 00:40:32,029
to remove that lump of cancer.

654
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:36,769
Thus, a miracle has come to this believer.

655
00:40:36,770 --> 00:40:38,999
- Amen! - Amen!

656
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,779
Now, let us give our final prayer.

657
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:46,379
I have an announcement to make.

658
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:49,150
If you are a newcomer, please come to the front.

659
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,219
Newcomers!

660
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:53,948
- You may leave the mats... - Come forward.

661
00:40:53,949 --> 00:40:55,219
- this way. - Come this way.

662
00:40:55,319 --> 00:40:56,350
The mats...

663
00:41:07,670 --> 00:41:10,039
Oh, right. Where is the prayer room?

664
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,468
- It's that way. - Right.

665
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,568
She can't see.

666
00:41:12,569 --> 00:41:13,609
- My sister can't see. - I can't see.

667
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:14,868
- It's this way. - I can't see.

668
00:41:14,869 --> 00:41:16,509
- I must go this way. - This way.

669
00:41:26,549 --> 00:41:28,249
- Don't look surprised. - I can't see.

670
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:29,250
You can't see.

671
00:41:32,889 --> 00:41:33,960
Thank you.

672
00:41:43,469 --> 00:41:44,469
- Ms. Son. - Yes?

673
00:41:44,839 --> 00:41:46,170
You're supposed to be blind.

674
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:48,540
I'll just keep my eyes closed.

675
00:41:49,270 --> 00:41:51,079
Keep them open and keep watch.

676
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:53,679
All right. It is a bit scary here.

677
00:42:05,159 --> 00:42:06,219
Gosh.

678
00:42:12,429 --> 00:42:13,429
Oh, no.

679
00:42:17,569 --> 00:42:20,040
(Laundry Room)

680
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:35,690
(Laundry Room)

681
00:42:39,889 --> 00:42:41,759
Gosh, my back is killing me from standing.

682
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,600
Staying healthy is the best thing.

683
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:48,299
Someone just went past me. Someone just went by!

684
00:42:57,409 --> 00:43:00,150
Darn it. I told them to get rid of the empty boxes.

685
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:04,480
Let's take a look.

686
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:08,949
Let's see.

687
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:13,589
Okay.

688
00:43:49,759 --> 00:43:52,429
Sir, there's another fuss in the lobby.

689
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,600
Gosh. Why can't they take care of it on their own?

690
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:58,299
- Let's go. - All right.

691
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,968
- Let's go. - Where is it?

692
00:43:59,969 --> 00:44:01,040
- It's that way. - My back hurts.

693
00:44:01,339 --> 00:44:04,239
My back is killing me. Standing is all I can do.

694
00:44:06,339 --> 00:44:07,379
What do I do?

695
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:08,380
My goodness.

696
00:44:15,989 --> 00:44:17,589
Something must be wrong with my back.

697
00:44:23,659 --> 00:44:24,699
Okay.

698
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:27,670
Gosh. What do I do?

699
00:44:28,299 --> 00:44:29,929
- Did you get it? - Come on.

700
00:44:30,369 --> 00:44:31,869
- Let's get out of here. - Okay.

701
00:44:32,969 --> 00:44:34,009
We took too long.

702
00:44:34,569 --> 00:44:36,568
Give me back my wife!

703
00:44:36,569 --> 00:44:38,908
- You can be like this here. - Calm down?

704
00:44:38,909 --> 00:44:39,909
Drag him out.

705
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:41,609
- Hey! - Come this way.

706
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:43,719
You made us get a divorce out of nowhere!

707
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:47,088
Hey! Where's the pastor?

708
00:44:47,089 --> 00:44:49,548
Hey! You cult members!

709
00:44:49,549 --> 00:44:52,388
- Hey! - This place is a mess.

710
00:44:52,389 --> 00:44:54,659
Stay focused. Use your cane.

711
00:44:56,290 --> 00:44:57,699
My goodness.

712
00:44:57,799 --> 00:44:59,559
They're dragging him out.

713
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:01,270
You're totally not blind right now.

714
00:45:02,569 --> 00:45:04,068
That's just awful.

715
00:45:04,069 --> 00:45:06,440
Stay focused until the end.

716
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:08,040
Just a moment.

717
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:12,408
Oh, yes. Hallelujah.

718
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:15,249
- Right. - We're heading out.

719
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:18,480
Is that so? Just a moment.

720
00:45:20,549 --> 00:45:22,020
What are you doing?

721
00:45:22,449 --> 00:45:24,359
- Bang! - Gosh! What are you doing?

722
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:25,388
- You can see, right? - Yes, I can!

723
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:28,129
Hey! What are you doing? What do you mean you can see?

724
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:31,500
Why are being so rude like this?

725
00:45:32,429 --> 00:45:33,460
Let's get...

726
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:38,940
My goodness.

727
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:43,068
What should I do? My goodness!

728
00:45:43,069 --> 00:45:44,079
Hey! Go away!

729
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:46,879
- I saw a miracle. - Get out!

730
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,379
- Pastor, it's a miracle! - Go away!

731
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:51,980
Hey! Go away!

732
00:45:52,119 --> 00:45:54,749
Bring them to me. They are swindlers.

733
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:56,048
Get off of me!

734
00:45:56,049 --> 00:45:57,359
- Let me go! - Wait a minute.

735
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:59,059
- Wait a minute! - Oh, my!

736
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:00,290
- No! - I'm sorry!

737
00:46:02,029 --> 00:46:03,029
Seriously.

738
00:46:04,029 --> 00:46:05,230
You bad people!

739
00:46:05,799 --> 00:46:08,068
- Go away! - Gosh.

740
00:46:08,069 --> 00:46:10,100
- My goodness. - Oh, my.

741
00:46:10,469 --> 00:46:12,369
- Hey! - Oh, my!

742
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:15,068
- Hey! - Stop.

743
00:46:15,069 --> 00:46:17,008
- Hey! No! - Oh, my.

744
00:46:17,009 --> 00:46:18,609
You bad people!

745
00:46:18,610 --> 00:46:20,209
Chase them, now.

746
00:46:20,210 --> 00:46:21,750
Seriously.

747
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:24,778
- Hey! - Hurry up!

748
00:46:24,779 --> 00:46:26,250
- Calm down. - My goodness.

749
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:28,618
- Get in. - Drive!

750
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:30,048
My goodness!

751
00:46:30,049 --> 00:46:31,060
Seriously.

752
00:46:35,889 --> 00:46:36,960
My goodness.

753
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:40,799
But you...

754
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:44,369
were running away without me.

755
00:46:45,069 --> 00:46:47,440
- Are you okay? - Yes, I had so much fun.

756
00:46:48,469 --> 00:46:50,278
Who said you were a bad actor, Lawyer Dong?

757
00:46:50,279 --> 00:46:51,738
You should change your career as an actor if you get fired.

758
00:46:51,739 --> 00:46:54,179
Look. I told you...

759
00:46:54,509 --> 00:46:55,980
this isn't a good idea.

760
00:46:56,310 --> 00:46:57,719
It may not be good,

761
00:46:58,580 --> 00:46:59,650
but it was the best.

762
00:47:01,719 --> 00:47:02,790
- Was it? - Yes.

763
00:47:05,719 --> 00:47:06,790
It hurts.

764
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:14,330
(Yerim Distribution)

765
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:19,639
It's a scam disguised as psychic abilities.

766
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,639
Pastor Cheonji is a cult leader.

767
00:47:24,810 --> 00:47:25,880
Let's stop.

768
00:47:29,509 --> 00:47:30,750
Did my wife ask you to do this?

769
00:47:30,949 --> 00:47:32,520
To fabricate the video...

770
00:47:33,319 --> 00:47:34,588
and make me change my heart?

771
00:47:34,589 --> 00:47:36,089
Let's at least reveal the truth.

772
00:47:36,290 --> 00:47:38,560
Ask Pastor Cheonji to hold a press conference.

773
00:47:38,690 --> 00:47:42,158
"I'm not Kim Young A's a mentor."

774
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:43,258
(CEO Yoo Min Chul)

775
00:47:43,259 --> 00:47:45,460
He's not someone whom I can ask to do this or that.

776
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:50,029
Then, let's upload this video on the Internet...

777
00:47:50,130 --> 00:47:51,440
and ask the public.

778
00:47:53,139 --> 00:47:55,968
If they think if it's fabricated or not.

779
00:47:55,969 --> 00:47:58,778
Then, my wife would be affected too.

780
00:47:58,779 --> 00:48:01,610
Our goal is to prevent a divorce,

781
00:48:03,049 --> 00:48:04,618
not to maintain her approval ratings.

782
00:48:04,619 --> 00:48:07,588
I doubt a company rumoured to have its CEO enchanted by a cult...

783
00:48:07,589 --> 00:48:09,989
must be listed well in the stock market.

784
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:14,460
I'll give you time to think until tomorrow.

785
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:23,499
Are you asking me to help Ms. Kim Young A?

786
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:24,669
Am I right?

787
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:27,569
You should've seen the video.

788
00:48:27,810 --> 00:48:29,338
It's filmed it in a way that could easily be misunderstood.

789
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:31,908
We can keep the cult members quiet.

790
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:33,408
Why are you making a fuss?

791
00:48:33,409 --> 00:48:34,448
(Cheonji Dongsan)

792
00:48:34,449 --> 00:48:36,210
It's because we're getting listed in the stock market soon.

793
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:38,479
If our company gets listed at a high price,

794
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,350
it'll be better for Cheonji Dongsan too.

795
00:48:41,549 --> 00:48:43,690
Please make an exception just this once.

(check his bank account. A record for the five-member society...)

799
00:49:08,509 --> 00:49:10,209
You need to pay the hospital bills for this month...

800
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:11,980
to extend the hospitalization.

801
00:49:13,279 --> 00:49:16,250
Our financial situation is not good due to the long hospitalization.

802
00:49:16,819 --> 00:49:20,060
Please wait until next week.

803
00:49:28,699 --> 00:49:31,900
Have you not received Professor Seo's phone yet?

804
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:40,710
Because of the recent case I've taken on,

805
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:45,449
I've been pondering about what trust really is.

806
00:49:47,719 --> 00:49:50,119
It feels like the most secure prison in the world.

807
00:49:51,619 --> 00:49:53,119
You can't escape...

808
00:49:54,190 --> 00:49:55,259
until you realize it.

809
00:49:59,659 --> 00:50:01,299
What are you trying to say?

810
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:04,040
Professor Seo...

811
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:06,368
must've invested in the five-member society...

812
00:50:06,369 --> 00:50:07,670
that Noh Yul Seong created.

813
00:50:09,139 --> 00:50:10,710
That's how he became one of the members.

814
00:50:11,339 --> 00:50:14,850
If he invested,

815
00:50:16,350 --> 00:50:17,719
then what?

816
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:21,319
You should think carefully why Noh Yul Seong...

817
00:50:22,489 --> 00:50:23,889
kept quiet.

818
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:27,389
I'll wait until...

819
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,429

00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:47,040
You saw what happened today and yesterday, right?

822
00:50:47,139 --> 00:50:49,908
Playing games is over for them. The end!

823
00:50:49,909 --> 00:50:51,449
When did they even start?

824
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:54,350
I should give you a lesson about love.

825
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:55,948
Where's Kwon Dae Gi?

826
00:50:55,949 --> 00:50:57,118
It's a misunderstanding.

827
00:50:57,119 --> 00:50:59,618
- It's not his name too. - Is it you?

828
00:50:59,619 --> 00:51:00,758

- You little... - Seriously, stop!

832
00:51:10,469 --> 00:51:12,298
- Who are you? - He is flirty,

833
00:51:12,299 --> 00:51:14,409
but he won't date a married woman.

834
00:51:14,770 --> 00:51:16,409
Tell him.

835
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:18,710
He didn't know.

836
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:20,080
Honey?

837
00:51:20,081 --> 00:51:22,879
For real. I didn't know.

838

- For goodness' sake! - Honey, calm down!

843
00:51:40,330 --> 00:51:41,330
Put this on.

844
00:52:14,929 --> 00:52:17,600
It's camomile tea. It'll make you calmer.

845
00:52:21,739 --> 00:52:24,679
This can't be true. She was married.

846
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:26,739
Thanks, anyway.

847
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:29,350
I'm touched...

848
00:52:30,110 --> 00:52:31,349
that you trusted me.

849
00:52:31,350 --> 00:52:33,850
I won't tell anyone so don't worry.

Every time you date someone,

857
00:53:28,909 --> 00:53:30,779
ask for a family relationship certificate.

866
00:54:15,319 --> 00:54:19,189
anything wrong about my interview?

867
00:54:19,190 --> 00:54:21,929
Who gave you the permission to have an interview like that?

868
00:54:22,889 --> 00:54:24,059

873
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:42,610
Look at this scum.

(SEOHAN UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL)

879
00:55:14,350 --> 00:55:16,850

00:56:29,049 --> 00:56:30,889
- Thank you, Dae Gi. - Sure.

902
00:56:33,319 --> 00:56:34,360
My goodness.

903
00:56:34,989 --> 00:56:38,130
You're right. The last person who called him was Noh Yul Seong.

904
00:56:38,259 --> 00:56:39,529
The number ending with 2711.

905
00:56:39,929 --> 00:56:40,929
Wait.

906
00:56:42,529 --> 00:56:44,369
November 10, 4am.

907
00:56:45,239 --> 00:56:46,270
It's right before his suicide.

908
00:57:17,369 --> 00:57:20,500
CEO Noh, please give me back one million dollars that I invested.

909
00:57:20,600 --> 00:57:21,868
It's urgent.

910
00:57:21,869 --> 00:57:23,210
(CEO Noh)

911
00:57:27,909 --> 00:57:30,509
(CEO Noh)

912
00:57:32,179 --> 00:57:35,088
I can't call. I need it immediately.

913
00:57:35,089 --> 00:57:36,350
I'll send you my bank account number.

914
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:48,069
Professor Seo is under investigation by the prosecutors.

915
00:57:48,770 --> 00:57:50,230
What's Na Yu Mi's case?

916
00:57:50,630 --> 00:57:51,799
He's a witness.

917
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:00,580
Where are you?

918
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:04,179
At my school.

919
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:08,250
Answer my call.

920
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:19,029
(CEO Noh)

921
00:58:21,799 --> 00:58:25,770
What was automatically recorded on his phone has been restored.

922
00:58:28,409 --> 00:58:30,838
(Call recording: CEO Noh)

923
00:58:30,839 --> 00:58:31,839
Hello.

924
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:34,579
Are you trying to come clean in front of the prosecutors...

925
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:35,949
after you withdraw your investments?

926
00:58:37,279 --> 00:58:39,278
You're a witness.

927
00:58:39,279 --> 00:58:41,420
Why are you scared?

928
00:58:42,589 --> 00:58:45,560
The prosecutors requested a search and seizure warrant.

929
00:58:45,589 --> 00:58:47,060
It'll be ready in an hour.

930
00:58:48,029 --> 00:58:49,529
I have recordings on my phone.

931
00:58:49,989 --> 00:58:53,029
Regarding change of purpose and bribery.

932
00:58:54,869 --> 00:58:55,969
You're mad.

933
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,000
(Professor Seo)

934
00:59:00,001 --> 00:59:01,540
Pull me out of this.

935
00:59:02,339 --> 00:59:05,540
Just withdraw my money.

936
00:59:06,779 --> 00:59:08,409
I'm not like you.

937
00:59:08,610 --> 00:59:10,409
That's my entire savings.

938
00:59:11,250 --> 00:59:13,449
What is he talking about?

939
00:59:13,819 --> 00:59:18,060
Professor Seo wants to come clean. What shall we do?

940
00:59:18,159 --> 00:59:19,159
To who?

941
00:59:19,759 --> 00:59:21,460
- To the prosecutors. - What?

942
00:59:21,889 --> 00:59:24,190
What a nut job. Are you crazy?

943
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:29,600
Who's against taking Professor Seo out of our group?

944
00:59:42,779 --> 00:59:44,618
Between us, betrayal means death.

945
00:59:44,619 --> 00:59:45,949
From now on, you will die alone.

946
00:59:46,679 --> 00:59:47,750
CEO Noh.

947
00:59:58,759 --> 01:00:01,369
(CEO Noh)

948
01:00:08,069 --> 01:00:10,338
In 30 minutes, your wife, daughter,

949
01:00:10,339 --> 01:00:12,139
and mother will all see this video.

950
01:00:12,909 --> 01:00:14,750
So escape,

951
01:00:14,850 --> 01:00:16,779
or die. Choose one.

952
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,900
(Call recording: CEO Noh)

953
01:01:13,299 --> 01:01:16,210
(SMS history)

954
01:01:19,139 --> 01:01:20,480
He was in full acceleration mode.

955
01:01:24,549 --> 01:01:26,179
I didn't think he'd go to that extent.

956
01:01:31,259 --> 01:01:32,259
Let's go together.

957
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:34,989
We should step on the brake for him.

958
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:44,968
Why are you here?

959
01:01:44,969 --> 01:01:47,539
Oh, I just missed you.

960
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:48,540
What are you talking about?

961
01:01:55,810 --> 01:01:56,810
Here.

962
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:59,949
These are Professor Seo's phone and forensic files.

963
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:02,989
Oh, yes.

964
01:02:03,719 --> 01:02:05,489
It's the evidence to prove...

965
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:07,759
that Noh Yul Seong made Seo Woong Jin commit suicide.

966
01:02:08,259 --> 01:02:09,690
CEO Noh did that to Professor Seo?

967
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:13,330
There wasn't much in Na Yu Mi's case file.

968
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:16,500
So I'm digging his involvement in Professor Seo's suicide first.

969
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:19,500
That's a good move.

970
01:02:21,869 --> 01:02:23,739
Jin Woo. Prosecutor Park.

971
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:28,980
Please put Noh Yul Seong in jail...

972
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:31,549
and unload my anger.

973
01:02:32,319 --> 01:02:33,649
- All right. - Okay.

974
01:02:33,650 --> 01:02:34,650
- Goodbye. - Disciple of justice,

975
01:02:34,651 --> 01:02:35,690
- Prosecutor Park. - Yes.

976
01:03:05,380 --> 01:03:08,250
(Seo Woong Jin's forensic files)

977
01:03:15,659 --> 01:03:16,790
The phone too.

978
01:03:30,639 --> 01:03:34,679
Don't worry about the casino entry records.

979
01:03:37,610 --> 01:03:39,080
We'll cover it for you.

980
01:03:51,529 --> 01:03:52,630
It's done.

981
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:54,000
Good job.

982
01:03:55,469 --> 01:03:57,230
Make sure to clean up the forensic company,

983
01:03:57,799 --> 01:03:59,670
their office,

984
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:01,670
and their houses...

985
01:04:02,069 --> 01:04:03,639
so that there aren't any copies.

986
01:04:06,610 --> 01:04:07,639
Okay.

987
01:04:39,909 --> 01:04:41,380
(Kim Sa Ra)

988
01:04:51,150 --> 01:04:52,759
For goodness' sake.

989
01:04:55,929 --> 01:04:59,230
Bom, do you know Sa Ra's exact house address?

990
01:04:59,429 --> 01:05:00,699
Please send it to me.

991
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:02,029
Is everything okay?

992
01:05:02,130 --> 01:05:03,968
I need to check something. Hurry.

993
01:05:03,969 --> 01:05:04,969
Okay.

994
01:05:15,350 --> 01:05:17,579
The phone is turned off.

995
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:19,679
Please leave a message after the tone.

996
01:05:19,779 --> 01:05:22,020
You will be charged.

997
01:05:35,730 --> 01:05:36,799
Kim Sa Ra.

998
01:05:43,210 --> 01:05:44,270
Kim Sa Ra.

999
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:48,040
Lawyer Dong. Open your eyes. Lawyer Dong!

1000
01:06:53,239 --> 01:06:54,239
Gi Jun!

1001
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:07,989
(Queen of Divorce)

1002
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:39,118
Let's find the best solution for Ms. Kim.

1003
01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:42,190
Noh Yul Seong is supporting Assemblyman Ha Hyun Ho.

1004
01:07:42,460 --> 01:07:44,258
What can Kim Young A do now?

1005
01:07:44,259 --> 01:07:46,199
It's like getting a death sentence in politics.

1006
01:07:46,759 --> 01:07:48,730
I'm making a difficult decision.

1007
01:07:48,830 --> 01:07:51,869
I accept my husband's request to divorce me.

1008
01:07:52,270 --> 01:07:55,869
The solution for this round is a custody battle.

1009
01:07:56,270 --> 01:07:57,369
Demolishing Cheonji.

1010
01:07:57,610 --> 01:07:58,610
So we will...

1011
01:08:00,239 --> 01:08:01,380
be very detailed.

1012
01:08:03,549 --> 01:08:04,749
I've made a mistake worthy of death.

1013
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:07,948
Why did you when you can't even die?

1014
01:08:07,949 --> 01:08:11,420
It's not just me. Sa Ra, are you all right?

1015
01:08:14,290 --> 01:08:15,560
No, I'm not.
