Hello.

7
00:00:53,991 --> 00:00:55,459
- Hello. - Hey.

8
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,630
Just in case my husband tried anything funny.

9
00:00:58,130 --> 00:00:59,888
Ms. Lee will be with him when he goes to school.

10
00:00:59,889 --> 00:01:02,528
Gosh. Don't worry about him. My housekeeper is good with kids.

11
00:01:02,529 --> 00:01:04,469
You'll have a friend when you come to my house.

12
00:01:05,329 --> 00:01:06,399
He can play with my daughter.

13
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,410
Be a good boy, and listen to her while I go on a business trip.

14
00:01:13,009 --> 00:01:14,039
Say bye to your mom.

15
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:15,610
Bye, Mom.

16
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:16,978
- Do you want some snacks? - Yes.

17
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:19,550
I made delicious snacks for you. Let's go.

18
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:22,919
Let's go. I wonder what kind of snack you will like.

You said we were still on the same team.

21
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:52,850
And I'm going to believe you.

22
00:01:53,949 --> 00:01:56,619
Whatever the reason is, I want to see him go down too.

23
00:01:59,149 --> 00:02:00,220
By the way,

24
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:03,220
Chairwoman Cha seemed as if she had been wronged pretty badly.

25
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,459
Aren't you scared?

26
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:08,599
I am. I've been smiling so hard not to look scared.

27
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,199
So I have a muscle cramp here.

28
00:02:12,329 --> 00:02:13,329
What about Noh Yul Seong?

29
00:02:14,699 --> 00:02:16,340
Nothing yet, for now.

30
00:02:16,769 --> 00:02:18,638
As for Professor Seo's case,

31
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,669
he got rid of Professor Seo's phone. So it won't be easy.

32
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:25,009
As for my mom's case, it's still a perfect crime.

33
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,449
- Then... - I must corner him...

34
00:02:28,449 --> 00:02:31,949
until he makes a bigger mistake, trying to cover up a small mistake.

35
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,229

36
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:40,660
It's the 50-Million-Dollar Club.

37
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,399
Is it the five-member society your father talked about?

38
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,470
Yes. They gave out money as bribes.

39
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,940
I hope you can use this to corner him.

Let's get rid of the people backing Noh Yul Seong.

47
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:08,488
Since he bribed people,

48
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:10,660
he must have a ledger. A ledger for the bribes.

49
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:14,930
The ledger will be Noh Yul Seong's last weapon.

50
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,798
What? It won't be his weakness?

51
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:18,600
Before it becomes his weakness, he will use it as a weapon.

52
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:20,728
He will probably blackmail the people on the ledger...

53
00:03:20,729 --> 00:03:22,699
to get him out of trouble.

54
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,139
So you want to obtain the ledger, right?

55
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:28,940
Yes. We have to make sure he doesn't get away with this.

56
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,609
Not until I send him to prison for murdering my mother.

57
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:36,548
Gosh. The ledger... Where do you think it is?

58
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,488

65
00:03:50,829 --> 00:03:52,429

69

He's the weak link.

70
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:05,079
Ms. Kim. If someone bribed you, where would you keep it?

71
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,750
Well,

72
00:04:08,419 --> 00:04:10,180
I've never received a bribe. So I wouldn't know.

73
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,650
- Not the bank, for sure. - Right.

74
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:16,619
If it goes over 10,000 dollars,

75
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,328
it gets reported to the Financial Supervisory Service by default.

76
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:20,459
- Right. - That's why you need...

77
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,200
a secret storage for black money.

78
00:04:23,359 --> 00:04:25,530
A storage for a secret fund of the five-member society?

79
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:28,970
The ledger must be in there too.

80
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:32,869
First of all, let's follow the trail of Park Jong Il's bribes.

81
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:36,738

Gosh. People call my flattery work a masterpiece.

101

102
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:13,270
Okay.

103
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:16,039

That was some expensive interview, wasn't it?

106
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,249
I made you waste your talent on something like this.

107
00:06:27,619 --> 00:06:29,660
I'm sorry and grateful at the same time.

108
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,830
I always wanted to repay you. You gave me a chance to do that.

109
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:36,729
- I hope your son is doing well. - Yes, thanks to you.

110
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,100
I hope you win this one like you did for me.

111
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:41,128
Yes, that will be the case.

112
00:06:41,129 --> 00:06:42,169
You see,

113
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:45,140
these two ladies are no joke.

114
00:06:47,309 --> 00:06:48,340
We'll make sure to win.

115
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:51,609

116
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:55,150
Remember what you told me the other day? It's...

117
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,889
What is it?

118
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,749
I have to take a picture when I see something beautiful.

119
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:01,590
What?

120
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:06,289
From now on, no mention of your exes.

121
00:07:06,729 --> 00:07:07,760
I'm talking about your ex-girlfriends.

The day we bring down Noh Yul Seong...

123
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,900
will be the first day of our relationship.

124
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:16,298
Seriously? Did you just say that? That was so sudden.

125
00:07:16,299 --> 00:07:17,340
Look ahead.

126
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,339
- Here's the sweet and sour chicken. - Thank you.

127
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,779
- Thank you. - Sure. Enjoy.

128
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:00,779
The fishcake soup will be out soon. Sure.

129
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,849
Hey, you're here.

130
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:04,748
Gosh. This is why I told you I was against this solution.

131
00:08:04,749 --> 00:08:05,949
I'm so busy.

132
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:07,689
- A bottle of beer, please. - Sure.

133
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,859
I'm not buying what she said.

134
00:08:11,359 --> 00:08:13,459
Gosh. That is one impressive vending machine.

135
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,959
He got the downpayment, did the interview,

136
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,399
and wrote the article within 30 minutes. Ta-da.

137
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,799
People who use their talents solely for their own gain...

138
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:22,369
all ought to suffer in a pit of fire.

139
00:08:26,169 --> 00:08:27,169
Hey.

140
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:28,809
The money bag is on the move.

141
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,179
Where's the destination?

142
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,720
He just drove toward Danyeong.

143
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:35,979
Danyeong?

144
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,279
Danyeong?

145
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,149
Danyeong in Gyeonggi Province? Where Chayul Law Firm has land?

146
00:08:40,489 --> 00:08:41,489
Yes. That's the place.

147
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:44,729
Look closely at which part of Danyeong he's going to. Okay.

148
00:08:53,729 --> 00:08:55,739
Are you sure this land belongs to Chayul?

149
00:08:55,899 --> 00:08:57,940
Yes. All the land in this vicinity belongs to Chayul.

150
00:08:58,509 --> 00:09:02,080

157
00:09:33,009 --> 00:09:35,509
Did you write the article for this restaurant?

158
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,278
You didn't cut a deal with them or anything, right?

159
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,310
Gosh, what deal?

160
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,680
But why do you ask?

161
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:43,018
The restaurant owner works with Dong Gi Jun.

162
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:44,649
The one who's investigating Professor Seo's case.

163
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:46,889
Don't keep them close.

164
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,470
The land does belong to Chairwoman Cha.

165
00:09:59,029 --> 00:10:00,700
But someone else has been managing the farmland.

166

It's Park Jong Il.

167
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,238
Farmland, my foot.

168
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:07,940
He was probably managing the secrets of the five-member society.

169
00:10:08,739 --> 00:10:11,179
By the way, where's the secret storage here?

170
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,580
I only see fields of garlic here.

171
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:16,779
Right. Fields of garlic.

172
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,319
Right.

173
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,220
No law says that only garlic can grow from the garlic fields.

174
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:25,690
If you plant beans, you get beans. If you plant garlic, you get garlic.

175
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,259
So if they were to plant bundles of bills,

176
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,728
they would get cash, right?

177
00:10:30,729 --> 00:10:32,129
I see.

178
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:36,540
Gosh. How are we going to dig up the entire field?

179
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,009
Let's start digging first.

180
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:43,509
Gosh, Lawyer Dong.

181
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:47,710
- But this is... - Gosh. Come on, guys.

182
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,080
We don't have time to dig up the entire field.

183
00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:51,889
We must dig it up in one go.

184
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,749
All right.

185
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,519
Hey, guys!

186
00:11:00,859 --> 00:11:02,060
The excavator is launched!

187
00:11:02,430 --> 00:11:03,700
- Can you see that? - Gosh.

188
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:35,899
Gosh. Look over there!

189
00:11:44,499 --> 00:11:46,170
Darn it. There's no ledger.

190
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:49,180
Then does it mean this money is for Park Jong Il's personal use?

191
00:11:50,139 --> 00:11:52,479
I don't think we'll find anything even if we keep digging.

192
00:11:52,609 --> 00:11:54,050
Unless they buried the ledger more deeply.

193
00:11:54,479 --> 00:11:56,149
I doubt that they buried it deeply...

194
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,190
because they probably had to check the ledger frequently.

195
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:01,590
If it's not in the garlic field...

196
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,040
Gosh.

197
00:12:24,109 --> 00:12:25,180
Flash it there.

198
00:12:35,489 --> 00:12:37,289
You startled me. What's that?

199
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:40,559
There's some kind of manual these corrupt people follow.

200
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,229
They always hide their secret in places like this.

201
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:43,430
Step back for a second.

202
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:53,570
Exactly where?

203
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,609
Trust me on this.

204
00:13:02,379 --> 00:13:04,579
Gosh. At this point, we should find a hole in the wall,

205
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,649
or a secret safe should show up.

206
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:11,359
It's not in there.

207
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:13,290
Only a fool would hide it there.

208
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:22,369
I guess a fool hid the ledger right here.

209
00:13:24,869 --> 00:13:27,269
What? No way. It can't be.

210
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,080
What?

211
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,079
(Na Sung Il, a law professor)

212
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:36,420
Gosh. All the transaction records and their names are on this.

213
00:13:37,249 --> 00:13:38,320
With this,

214
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,450
he'll be charged with bribery.

215
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:45,190
We finally found people who are backing Noh Yul Seong.

216
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:52,269
What? Did you guys find it?

217
00:13:53,869 --> 00:13:54,869
Good job.

218
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,639
What? What are you talking about?

219
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,080
Let me get this straight.

220
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:08,419
Kim Sa Ra has our ledger?

221
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,580
Gosh, what should we do?

222
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,989
How did she find out where it was?

223
00:14:22,129 --> 00:14:23,499
- Hey. - Yes.

224
00:14:24,659 --> 00:14:26,269
There was a deal with that restaurant article, right?

225
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:29,839
- Right? You got caught, didn't you? - Gosh.

226
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:32,769
No. Let me explain. The article...

227
00:14:32,909 --> 00:14:35,579
It's not like I did this on purpose.

228
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,778
- You know? - Gosh, you jerk.

229
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:38,778
- How could you be so brazen? - Hey.

230
00:14:38,779 --> 00:14:40,049
- Stop it. - How dare you?

231
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:41,209
I told you to go easy...

232
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:43,018
- on taking those backroom deals. - Hey, stop it.

233
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:44,719
- I never liked this jerk. - You're going to kill him.

234
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,720
- This jerk. - My gosh.

235
00:14:45,721 --> 00:14:46,819
- You've been going around town... - This is just great.

236
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,858
- for money like some desperate dog. - He can't take a punch.

237
00:14:48,859 --> 00:14:50,019
- Stop it. - You're taking money from everyone.

238
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,059
- Seriously. - Gosh, this useless jerk.

239
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,129
- Gosh. - Goodness.

240
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,998
- Are you free tomorrow? - Yes. Why?

241
00:14:56,999 --> 00:14:59,929
- If you're free tomorrow, - Hey, did you know...

242
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:02,069
- let's invite other kids... - That's why...

243
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:04,599
- Seo Yun. - Hello, mister.

244
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,170
- Sure. - I don't want to.

245
00:15:09,239 --> 00:15:10,609
Let's do that tomorrow.

246
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,249
- Hey, that elevator is open. - Gosh.

247
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:18,220
(Kind and reliable police alongside the people)

248
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:22,159
- What is it? - Bring me the ledger.

249
00:15:22,859 --> 00:15:24,690
Everything should go back to where it belongs.

250
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:27,989
The ledger, to the police. And you, to prison.

251
00:15:29,499 --> 00:15:31,769
Is that so? Then you should go back too.

252
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:34,029
To those days you couldn't see Seo Yun.

253
00:15:34,869 --> 00:15:35,939
Seo Yun?

254
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:38,570
The moment you hand over the ledger, you'll never see your son.

255
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,109
What...

256
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:43,608
What is it? Is something wrong?

257
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:44,609
(Seo Yun's Nanny, Ms. Lee)

258
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:48,479
- Yes, Ms. Lee. - Seo Yun is gone.

259
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,180
When he didn't come out from his academy, I went in to check.

260
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:54,820
(Contacts)

261
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,820
(My Love)

262
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,330
What's wrong?

263
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:04,029
He took Seo Yun.

264
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:06,200
What do I do?

265
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,608
Right. We can track children's cell phones.

266
00:16:12,609 --> 00:16:13,609
Let's go.

267
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,239
Can you look for Seo Yun?

268
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,979
I'll put an end to this with Noh Yul Seong.

269
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,580
No, wait.

270
00:16:28,119 --> 00:16:29,859
(Phone Location in Real-time)

271
00:16:58,489 --> 00:17:01,420
You piece of trash. How could you kidnap your own son?

272
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,658
How could you cross the line like this?

273
00:17:03,659 --> 00:17:04,790
Speak for yourself.

274
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:07,690
How could you do this to your husband?

275
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,869
- Where's Seo Yun? - Where's my reward?

276
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:21,240
Bring Seo Yun right now.

277
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:23,580
What if it's fake?

278
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,589
(Han Dong Jin: Assemblyman, Cha Yoon Sub: Chief Secretary)

279

(Kim Yu Shin: Chairperson, Oh Jung Jae: Director)

280
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:37,290
Give that to me first.

281
00:17:38,189 --> 00:17:39,730
How could I trust you?

282
00:17:44,699 --> 00:17:46,869
They're heading to the airport. They might leave the country.

283
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,240
Call him now!

284
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:54,310
Yes, sir.

285
00:18:07,949 --> 00:18:10,959
You sure stashed a lot of escape plans.

286
00:18:12,389 --> 00:18:14,590
Do you know who the most powerful person in the world is?

287
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,129
It's the person who has something...

288
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,699
on the most powerful person.

289
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,540
So know your place.

290
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,939
You can't beat me.

291
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,709
I do wonder if you'll be able to make use...

292
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:30,609
of all the escape plans you created.

293
00:18:45,219 --> 00:18:46,790
Gosh. Seriously.

Mom! Dad!

295

- Seo Yun! - Come to Daddy.

296
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,039
I was playing a fun game with your mom.

297
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:06,179
You should join us.

Right, Seo Yun?

00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:20,750
Darn you, Kim Sa Ra.

311
00:20:37,369 --> 00:20:39,669
We can't hand over the real ledger.

312

Please keep a close eye on Seo Yun.

313

Seo Yun, I told you not to follow anyone.

314
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,820
He said you were waiting for me.

315
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:55,790
That's what Dad's secretary said.

316
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,230

Seo Yun. Hello.

320
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,070
Hello.

321
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:18,080
I hope we can get along well.

322
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:20,409
All right. Pound it.

323
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:24,879
Boom.

324
00:21:34,959 --> 00:21:36,529
There has been a significant scandal...

325
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:38,099
surrounding the exposure of Chayul Law Firm's bribery ledger.

326
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,499
Each bribe amounted to five million dollars,

327
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,898
resulting in a total of 50 million dollars.

328
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:41,968
To build Chayul Town...

329
00:21:41,969 --> 00:21:44,569
It's been confirmed that CEO Noh Yul Seong had been...

330
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:47,169
bribing influential individuals to build Chayul Town.

331
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:50,208
I will now begin the investigation status briefing...

332
00:21:50,209 --> 00:21:52,708
on the bribery incident over the redevelopment area...

333
00:21:52,709 --> 00:21:55,309
in Seoha-dong which is also known as the Suspicious Chayul Town Case.

334
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,919
("Investigation Status Announcement on Bribery Case of Chayul Town")

335
00:22:00,219 --> 00:22:01,219
What is this about?

336
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:04,760
You'll regret it if you don't hear us out.

337
00:22:06,290 --> 00:22:07,790
Gong Deukgu talked.

338
00:22:08,129 --> 00:22:10,800
He said Noh Yul Seong and you were in the car...

339
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,330
with Ms. Kim's late mother on the day of her murder.

340
00:22:16,369 --> 00:22:19,109
That's why the prosecutor called in Noh Yul Seong.

341
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:21,540
One more thing.

342
00:22:24,709 --> 00:22:27,679
"Who was the one to push Park Jeong Suk at the factory?"

343
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,649
"It was Secretary Baek."

344
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:33,719
It's part of Noh Yul Seong's statement.

345
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:38,589
(Who was the one to push Park Jeong Suk at the factory?)

346
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:40,090
(It was Secretary Baek.)

347
00:22:43,129 --> 00:22:45,030
Do not lie to me with something fake like this.

348
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:47,800
The prosecutor in charge written there is my friend.

349
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:50,869
You can ask him if it's true or not.

350
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:53,270
Do you still think Noh Yul Seong is the one to rely on?

351
00:22:54,669 --> 00:22:55,810
Let's get to our senses.

352
00:23:11,889 --> 00:23:14,059
If he thought this was fake,

353
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,760
he would've shown it to Noh Yul Seong.

354
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,659
He was a bit shaken by it.

355
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:23,269
Gosh, our Lawyer Dong can stop training in the mountains now.

356
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:26,040
You know how to cross the line and make lies.

357
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:28,980
I've become so corrupt, haven't I?

358
00:23:29,310 --> 00:23:30,639
I'm in trouble.

359
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:32,550
This isn't right.

360
00:23:33,909 --> 00:23:35,149
You're doing great.

361
00:23:41,949 --> 00:23:43,459
You can go in that way. Let's hurry.

362
00:23:45,119 --> 00:23:46,189
Let's move.

363
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:54,300
It's the prosecution. It's a search and seizure.

364
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,570
I think they'll come in here first.

365
00:24:01,609 --> 00:24:03,479
After they're done, they will call for you.

366
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,408
So we need to be on the same line.

367
00:24:05,409 --> 00:24:06,409
Right.

368
00:24:06,709 --> 00:24:09,750
If they bring up about Seo Yun's grandmother, I wasn't in the car.

369
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:11,550
Sorry?

370
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,049
Gong Deukgu was driving and got off.

371
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:16,290
And then, you drove to the factory.

372
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,819
Just say you dropped her off at the factory.

373
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,428
This isn't about that.

374
00:24:20,429 --> 00:24:21,559
It's about the lobby funds.

375
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,300
It won't end there!

376
00:24:26,629 --> 00:24:28,530
If they find out that I was lying...

377
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,969
You have to get arrested. What else can we do?

378
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:33,869
Me?

379
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:36,109
Then shall I go to prison?

380
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,109
What about Chayul?

381
00:24:42,209 --> 00:24:45,019
Hey, don't worry about it. Why are you so scared?

382
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:47,649
I'll take care of you until the end even if that happens.

383
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,389
You trust me, don't you?

384
00:24:56,859 --> 00:24:58,899
The lobbying suspicion based on Chayul Town.

385
00:25:01,399 --> 00:25:03,000
This is a search and seizure warrant for that.

386
00:25:07,810 --> 00:25:08,840
Begin.

387
00:25:12,449 --> 00:25:13,949
Be careful with that, mister.

388
00:25:15,109 --> 00:25:17,679
He won't even listen.

389
00:25:18,149 --> 00:25:20,490
(Divorce Specialist SOLUTION)

390
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:25,859
The law school selection. Chayul Law Firm got eliminated!

391
00:25:26,889 --> 00:25:27,959
Ms. Kim!

392
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,229
Was it, "What goes around comes around?"

393
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,569
"Justice will prevail." "Self do, self have."

394
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:35,029
- "A taste of your own medicine." - Whatever.

395
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:37,599
Let's just go with, "Stepping on one's own foot."

396
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,139
- Aren't I right, Ms. Kim? - Yes.

397
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:42,740
We can now feel at ease and put an end to Mom's case.

398
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,550
Hey. What happened with Secretary Baek?

399
00:26:25,719 --> 00:26:26,719
It was a success.

400
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:28,889
He volunteered to help.

401
00:26:29,389 --> 00:26:30,389
Great work.

402
00:26:33,689 --> 00:26:36,259
But it's a bit of a worry...

403
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:38,359
that Noh Yul Seong is pushed to the corner.

404
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:40,698
It's time for him to struggle to survive.

405
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:43,369
No. I'm worried that he might target you.

406
00:26:46,369 --> 00:26:47,609
(Noh Yul Seong)

407
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,080
I'll be careful.

408
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,699
I knew you would come out right away.

409
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,129
What is your condition?

410
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,499
What do you want in exchange...

411
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,570
for telling me how my mom died?

412
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,139
Let me ask you something.

413
00:27:21,109 --> 00:27:23,310
Did you come into my house with an intention?

414
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:27,909
You must not be that busy,

415
00:27:28,609 --> 00:27:29,719
seeing you ask that kind of question.

416
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,020
So this is what betrayal feels like.

417
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:43,359
It must have been hard for you to leave me alone.

418
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,070
What are you doing with me?

419
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,439
Gosh. That must hurt.

420
00:30:13,649 --> 00:30:15,250
It feels uncomfortable, doesn't it?

421
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:28,359
Are you okay?

422
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:33,229
Beg me. Beg me to save you.

423
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:34,868
Do you even have the guts to save me?

424
00:30:34,869 --> 00:30:36,199
Your lips are still alive.

425
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,609
You killed my mom, right?

426
00:30:48,909 --> 00:30:50,480
Do you have evidence that I pushed her?

427
00:30:57,159 --> 00:30:58,320
So you did push her.

428
00:30:59,959 --> 00:31:00,959
How...

429
00:31:02,459 --> 00:31:04,159
How could you do that?

430
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:06,730
My mom was so nice to you!

431
00:31:06,869 --> 00:31:08,600
Hey, she was nice?

432
00:31:10,139 --> 00:31:11,139
She was nice to me?

433
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:14,340
Would someone nice come up to me and threaten me?

434
00:31:14,669 --> 00:31:17,740
Would someone nice threaten to do something if I don't...

435
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,209
get her daughter out of jail?

436
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:22,379
Did my mom go to you?

437
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,320
Here.

438
00:31:29,719 --> 00:31:33,529
"Chayul's bribe ledger is fake and I made it."

439
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:36,699
"I didn't think things would get this big. I apologize."

440
00:31:37,959 --> 00:31:39,300
Let's leave a voice recording.

441
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:44,199
How did you push my mom?

442
00:31:45,869 --> 00:31:48,039
Again. "The bribe ledge is fake."

443
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,340
Start the confession.

444
00:31:51,939 --> 00:31:53,349
Why did you push my mom?

445
00:31:53,350 --> 00:31:55,879
What do you mean I pushed her? Gosh.

446
00:31:57,250 --> 00:32:00,490
She got in the car. And she went up the factory.

447
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:03,619
What happened after that?

448
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:05,959
I didn't do anything wrong.

449
00:32:06,889 --> 00:32:08,090
I didn't do anything wrong.

450
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,830
You murderer.

451
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,699
Murderer? Are you insane?

452
00:32:19,199 --> 00:32:20,310
I said it wasn't me.

453
00:32:21,109 --> 00:32:25,378
If someone says something, you should learn how to listen.

454
00:32:25,379 --> 00:32:28,379
Why doesn't anyone around know how to listen?

455
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,560
My goodness.

456
00:32:44,859 --> 00:32:47,169
Sa Ra, what's this?

457
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:51,469
You've become a bugging expert,

458
00:32:52,169 --> 00:32:53,209
Kim Sa Ra.

459
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:04,250
(Noh Yul Seong)

460
00:33:05,649 --> 00:33:06,750
I'll be careful.

461
00:33:12,790 --> 00:33:16,230
He has his right and left arm cut off along with his back.

462
00:33:16,699 --> 00:33:18,330
I'm the only one he can trust.

463
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,770
If he makes me the one who made up the ledger,

464
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,070
he can find a way out.

465
00:33:27,409 --> 00:33:29,169
But Noh Yul Seong...

466
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:31,780
is the only solution left for me as well.

467
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,149
There are no witnesses or any evidence of my mom's murder.

468
00:33:36,919 --> 00:33:38,550
I need his confession.

469
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,990
You're going to get it from him on your own?

470
00:33:42,719 --> 00:33:44,119
He will try to make a deal with me.

471
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,560
That's my chance.

472
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:51,260
Okay. Let's give it a try.

473
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,369
I'll be careful.

474
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,869
You're going to be with me.

475
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:10,049
It's not working. She must've got caught.

476
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:11,919
What do we do? We haven't gotten anything yet.

477
00:34:15,089 --> 00:34:16,089
Let's enter.

478
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,230
What's wrong?

479
00:34:58,929 --> 00:35:00,000
Stay still.

480
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,379
It seems like he prepared a container.

481
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:16,049
Yongseong Port Container Yard.

482
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,290
I'll try to buy time as much as possible.

483
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,400
Gosh, this is so annoying.

484
00:35:40,069 --> 00:35:41,139
Hey.

485
00:35:41,770 --> 00:35:44,639
Do you think you'll find a way out if you bust the tire?

486
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:46,139
Get out.

487
00:35:54,350 --> 00:35:55,389
Get out now.

488
00:36:09,569 --> 00:36:10,900
The voice recorder is here!

489
00:36:20,049 --> 00:36:21,679
What do we do?

490
00:37:22,569 --> 00:37:23,610
Do you want some of this?

491
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,480
You look cold.

492
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:30,350
I heard this is bound for Senegal.

493
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,150
You can't quite imagine, can you?

494
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,588
If this closes up and gets loaded on the ship,

495
00:37:34,589 --> 00:37:37,790
it will take around two months to get there.

496
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:39,519
Don't worry too much.

497
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:42,928
I will ask them to bury you in a field...

498
00:37:42,929 --> 00:37:44,429
with lots of sunshine.

499
00:37:53,569 --> 00:37:54,569
It's cold.

500
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:03,449
I really loved you.

501
00:38:04,449 --> 00:38:05,549
That was why I married you.

502
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:06,889
Love?

503
00:38:07,989 --> 00:38:09,089
My foot.

504
00:38:09,989 --> 00:38:12,460
Marriage is like a closet for you.

505
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:14,960
You choose someone to wear or take off.

506
00:38:15,489 --> 00:38:17,159
Your wives are the clothes hanging there.

507
00:38:17,699 --> 00:38:20,198
Out of them, Kim Sa Ra was my favorite.

508
00:38:20,199 --> 00:38:21,869
You were the one to refuse to be that.

509
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,139
Hold on.

510
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:26,770
Hold on.

511
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:29,839
The important thing...

512
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:32,810
is that you have five minutes left.

513
00:38:33,549 --> 00:38:34,679
What does that mean?

514
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,380
It's 10:25pm.

515
00:38:37,449 --> 00:38:39,318
That container will close up...

516
00:38:39,319 --> 00:38:41,589
and loading starts at 10:30pm.

517
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,969
You two should go that way.

518
00:39:00,139 --> 00:39:01,568
- I'll go this way. - Okay.

519
00:39:01,569 --> 00:39:02,909
- I'll go that way. - Okay.

520
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:09,350
(5 minutes)

521
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,389
All right.

522
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:18,190
What is this? I didn't stop the recording.

523
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,360
Let's try with the voice recording once again.

524
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,229
A confession...

525
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:29,069
that you made the ledger up.

526
00:39:42,850 --> 00:39:43,850
It's cold, isn't it?

527
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,400
Right. You don't want to die, do you?

528
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,060
Sa Ra, we're not strangers to each other.

529
00:40:00,029 --> 00:40:01,170
Let's do each other a favor.

530
00:40:06,869 --> 00:40:10,480
Nothing will change even if you are found innocent of bribery.

531
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:14,509
Secretary Baek has gone to the prosecution.

532
00:40:17,350 --> 00:40:18,880
What have you done with him?

533
00:40:30,259 --> 00:40:31,399
Where are you?

534
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,600
I'm sorry, sir.

535
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:37,670
I will get punished only for the things I have done.

536
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,639
Hello? Hey!

537
00:40:41,869 --> 00:40:44,009
This stupid jerk.

538
00:40:48,179 --> 00:40:50,419
Sa Ra, do you not care about your life?

539
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:52,479
You're kicking away your opportunity to live.

540
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,290
Now, your crime against my mother...

541
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,048
will be revealed to the world.

542
00:40:56,049 --> 00:40:58,059
That's just him making those claims anyway.

543
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:59,519
This is what's important.

544
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,159
(5 minutes)

545
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:05,360
This container will close up soon.

546
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:25,750
This won't work. I should just get going.

547
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:31,159
You'll agree to do this, I suppose. Here.

548
00:41:33,159 --> 00:41:34,658
Say your last words to Seo Yun.

549
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:36,060
I'll let him listen to it once he gets older.

550
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,330
(General)

551
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:43,199
Seo Yun.

552
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,000
The one who pushed your grandmother was your dad.

553
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:48,069
How many times do I have to tell you it wasn't me?

554
00:42:01,089 --> 00:42:02,389
How much time do I have left?

555
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,389
Now you're curious about that?

556
00:42:05,989 --> 00:42:06,989
Feeling scared now?

557
00:42:08,489 --> 00:42:09,588
(5 minutes)

558
00:42:09,589 --> 00:42:11,129
There's less than two minutes left.

559
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:13,259
You said it'd be over once that door closes.

560
00:42:13,469 --> 00:42:14,968
So tell me.

561
00:42:14,969 --> 00:42:16,699
Tell me how my mom died...

562
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,600
before I die.

563
00:42:19,799 --> 00:42:20,839
Did you...

564
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:23,679
try to kill my mom from the start?

565
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:27,380
Did you push her?

566
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:30,020
(5 minutes)

567
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:35,750
I did push her.

568
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:37,589
It was me.

569
00:42:38,659 --> 00:42:41,460
I did push her, but it wasn't on purpose. It was a mistake.

570
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:43,290
Are you happy now?

571
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:48,199
It was a mistake so I had no intention to kill her.

572
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,940
So it was you who killed my mom.

573
00:42:54,969 --> 00:42:56,779
You were the one who pushed her.

574
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:01,379
You made her fall but didn't care to look.

575
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:02,549
You just let her die.

576
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:07,420
You're a murderer for just letting her die like that.

577
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:10,759
This is why I can't let you live.

578
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:16,759
I wish...

579
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:20,630
that Seo Yun doesn't become a piece of trash like you.

580
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:24,469
Please tell him that.

581
00:43:26,339 --> 00:43:27,369
Fine.

582
00:43:38,779 --> 00:43:39,779
Sa Ra.

583
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:44,790
It's really time to say goodbye.

584
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:50,259
Right.

585
00:44:00,810 --> 00:44:02,639
That is my last gift for you.

586
00:44:02,909 --> 00:44:05,639
You can untie it yourself and leave comfortably.

587
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:33,199
Wait!

588
00:45:38,839 --> 00:45:39,839
Stop!

589
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:44,739
Stop!

590
00:45:50,009 --> 00:45:51,080
Kim Sa Ra!

591
00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:23,810
We should be together...

592
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:26,139
until the end.

593
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:37,219
Kim Sa Ra.

594
00:47:41,759 --> 00:47:43,759
Sa Ra, wake up.

595
00:47:53,670 --> 00:47:56,469
Are you okay? Can you see me?

596
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:03,880
Here. Be careful.

597
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:25,639
I was scared to death.

598
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:29,040
What?

599
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:33,239
I thought you weren't coming this time.

600
00:48:42,949 --> 00:48:45,520
Why does your heartbeat sound so desperate?

601
00:48:46,619 --> 00:48:48,330
You make me worried and feel sorry.

602
00:48:55,069 --> 00:48:56,170
I'm glad...

603
00:48:57,839 --> 00:48:59,469
that you're worried.

604
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:44,949
Where are you going?

605
00:49:45,549 --> 00:49:47,080
You need to see me.

606
00:50:34,799 --> 00:50:35,830
A moment, please.

607
00:50:37,699 --> 00:50:39,000
It's over.

608
00:50:39,799 --> 00:50:40,839
Admit it.

609
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:43,710
What's over and admit what?

610
00:50:44,339 --> 00:50:45,639
What did I do wrong?

611
00:51:05,259 --> 00:51:06,259
What did I...

612
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:08,270
What are you doing?

613
00:51:14,569 --> 00:51:16,440
Why didn't you turn off the recordings?

614
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:22,549
I did push her,

615
00:51:22,810 --> 00:51:25,619
but it wasn't on purpose. It was a mistake.

616
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,520
This is the essence of confession.

617
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:30,859
Kim Sa Ra. You seriously...

618
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:31,920
What's over, you asked?

619
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:37,429
You, like a water flea, being unable to escape.

620
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:40,868
You receiving punishment for the sins you committed.

621
00:51:40,869 --> 00:51:42,130
Especially, you asking for forgiveness...

622
00:51:44,500 --> 00:51:46,040
to my mother until you die.

623
00:51:47,409 --> 00:51:49,810
Stay healthy while you're locked up in prison for a long time.

624
00:51:50,310 --> 00:51:53,839
Eventually, even someone like you...

625
00:51:54,679 --> 00:51:56,449
would be able to live like a human.

626
00:51:58,619 --> 00:52:00,319
I wish you could.

627
00:52:04,989 --> 00:52:06,589
Come here, you jerk. Hey.

628
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:09,129
Let me go. I have something to say.

629
00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:10,900
Do you think this is the end?

630
00:52:11,029 --> 00:52:13,100
I'll kill all of you!

631
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:14,569
Let me go!

632
00:52:15,270 --> 00:52:17,029
I'll walk myself! Let go!

633
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:28,009
Thanks for your effort.

634
00:52:30,779 --> 00:52:33,819
Ms. Kim, your kick was amazing.

635
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:37,919
I didn't kick him properly as I wasn't feeling well.

636
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:40,730
What are you talking about? It was awesome. You're the best!

637
00:53:00,509 --> 00:53:02,178
(The Late Park Jeong Suk)

638
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:03,749
Do you remember your grandma?

639
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:06,750
Yes, she said I was kind, and that's why she liked me.

640
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:07,989
She said I resembled you.

641
00:53:12,389 --> 00:53:16,389
Mom, people say that Seo Yun is an exact duplicate of me.

642
00:53:19,299 --> 00:53:22,270
Please take care of my son from there.

643
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:24,899
(Birth: October 11, 1959, Death: October 31, 2022)

644
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:27,540
Please take care your daughter...

645
00:53:28,170 --> 00:53:30,239
and grandson together.

646
00:53:30,369 --> 00:53:32,879
Hello. You're my mother's friend.

647
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,250
Yes, that's right.

648
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:37,920
Seo Yun, how are you doing?

649
00:53:38,549 --> 00:53:39,619
Fist bump.

650
00:53:41,389 --> 00:53:43,588
(The Late Park Jeong Suk)

651
00:53:43,589 --> 00:53:45,789
(Birth: October 11, 1959, Death: October 31, 2022)

652
00:53:45,790 --> 00:53:48,060
I'm the prosecutor whom you came...

653
00:53:48,790 --> 00:53:50,230
to see you with a memo.

654
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:52,799
This is what I look like.

655
00:53:55,170 --> 00:53:56,670
I'm sorry for...

656
00:53:57,230 --> 00:53:59,869
recognizing you too late and for coming to see you...

657
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:02,508
too late.

658
00:54:02,509 --> 00:54:04,639
(The Late Park Jeong Suk)

659
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:09,610
I'll repay the debt to your daughter and grandson twice over.

660
00:54:11,179 --> 00:54:12,779
How will you repay?

661
00:54:14,790 --> 00:54:15,819
Seo Yun.

662
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:23,230
Let's go.

663
00:54:33,869 --> 00:54:34,909
Maybe like this?

664
00:54:48,589 --> 00:54:53,119
(A few months later)

665
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:02,400
The second floor has been vacant for too long.

666
00:55:04,029 --> 00:55:05,799
Should I go back there?

667
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:07,400
How about your current law firm?

668
00:55:07,509 --> 00:55:09,039
You joined them recently.

669
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:11,810
My contract will end in a year.

670
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:14,679
How can I wait until then?

671
00:55:17,279 --> 00:55:19,279
I know very well how you feel.

672
00:55:19,949 --> 00:55:22,290
I know just how hard it is...

673
00:55:22,889 --> 00:55:24,659
to wait endlessly.

674
00:55:29,290 --> 00:55:30,799
How about this one?

675
00:55:31,659 --> 00:55:32,659
No.

676
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:34,730
No?

677
00:55:35,429 --> 00:55:38,139
Wait. Then, how about that?

678
00:55:39,639 --> 00:55:40,909
Not really.

679
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:43,639
How about that?

680
00:55:44,839 --> 00:55:46,278
It's pretty.

681
00:55:46,279 --> 00:55:47,339
- Right? - Yes.

682
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:48,980
Can we see that, please?

683
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:53,449
How does it look?

684
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,448
It's pretty. Do you like it?

685
00:55:55,449 --> 00:55:56,589
Very much.

686
00:55:56,690 --> 00:55:57,690
Okay.

687
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:00,159
We'll get these.

688
00:56:04,699 --> 00:56:06,698
Seo Yun, today is an important day.

689
00:56:06,699 --> 00:56:08,829
Can you congratulate them as promised?

690
00:56:08,830 --> 00:56:10,698
Of course, I can do it!

691
00:56:10,699 --> 00:56:11,900
Thank you, son.

692
00:56:12,069 --> 00:56:14,209
Have a good day at school. See you later.

693
00:56:14,210 --> 00:56:15,940
See you later.

694
00:56:17,009 --> 00:56:18,810
Seo Yun!

695
00:56:21,850 --> 00:56:23,149
I love you, son.

696
00:56:23,150 --> 00:56:24,779
I love you too, Mom.

697
00:56:24,819 --> 00:56:26,080
See you later.

698
00:56:27,790 --> 00:56:29,920
- Hello. - Seo Yun, come here quick!

699
00:56:33,290 --> 00:56:36,029
Ms. Kim, your makeup reservation is at 12pm.

700
00:56:41,029 --> 00:56:42,329
(Park Na Yeon)

701
00:56:42,330 --> 00:56:43,698
(Lee Joo Won)

702
00:56:43,699 --> 00:56:45,138
(Han Ji In)

703
00:56:45,139 --> 00:56:46,600
(Kim Young A)

704
00:56:57,819 --> 00:56:59,380
For goodness' sake.

705
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:03,190
This is difficult.

706
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:07,060
Rich woman, you're amazing!

707
00:57:10,029 --> 00:57:11,060
Is this too much?

708
00:57:11,330 --> 00:57:13,199
The fatter, the better.

709
00:57:13,299 --> 00:57:14,629
Especially, for cash envelopes.

710
00:57:14,630 --> 00:57:16,199
- You're right. - Yes.

711
00:57:16,429 --> 00:57:18,670
Is it my fault for divorcing and earning a lot of money?

712
00:57:18,839 --> 00:57:19,969
She's just lucky.

713
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:21,968
- It's great for her. - Brava.

714
00:57:21,969 --> 00:57:24,139
- She'll faint in happiness. - Faint, for sure.

715
00:57:24,639 --> 00:57:25,779
I should go to that side.

716
00:57:27,239 --> 00:57:28,448
(Bride)

717
00:57:28,449 --> 00:57:30,350
(Monetary gift)

718
00:57:35,750 --> 00:57:39,360
He's so cute. He takes after his mother.

719
00:57:51,569 --> 00:57:53,869
The groom, Kwon Dae Gi...

720
00:57:54,310 --> 00:57:56,009
and the bride, Kang Bom...

721
00:57:56,710 --> 00:57:59,339
will need a big round of applause.

722
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:19,560
I invited them.

723
00:58:19,759 --> 00:58:21,299
What? Why?

724
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,670
Because you're mine now.

725
00:58:23,270 --> 00:58:25,469
I'll make sure to make a point in front of your exes.

726
00:58:34,449 --> 00:58:37,610
Next, we will have Kim Sa Ra, who is both the senior...

727
00:58:37,880 --> 00:58:40,520
and the CEO of the bride and groom...

728
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:42,819
to begin the officiation.

729
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:52,929
I have...

730
00:58:54,299 --> 00:58:57,529
married twice and divorced twice.

731
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,900
I am a divorce specialist.

732
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:05,838
So I feel embarrassed...

733
00:59:05,839 --> 00:59:08,310
to officiate.

734
00:59:09,049 --> 00:59:12,048
But wouldn't I know more...

735
00:59:12,049 --> 00:59:14,489
than people who have never married?

736
00:59:17,790 --> 00:59:19,190
Most definitely.

737
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:23,489
Marriage is a commitment...

738
00:59:23,830 --> 00:59:27,000
to eat more than 30,000 meals with the partner.

739
00:59:27,929 --> 00:59:32,199
Do you both want to share 30,000 meals together?

740
00:59:34,069 --> 00:59:36,039
I would want to eat three million meals with her!

741
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:37,040
Me too!

742
00:59:38,639 --> 00:59:39,639
Good.

743
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:42,908
It's the end of marriage when you...

744
00:59:42,909 --> 00:59:43,980
blame each other.

745
00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:45,749
Are you confident not to cry?

746
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:46,949
- Yes. - Yes!

747
00:59:47,819 --> 00:59:49,719
- "Yes." - Lastly,

748
00:59:50,219 --> 00:59:51,219
are you two...

749
00:59:52,489 --> 00:59:54,389
ready to break up?

750
00:59:54,830 --> 00:59:55,830
- Sorry? - Sorry?

751
00:59:58,230 --> 01:00:02,100
Dating doesn't become a burden only when it's not for life.

752
01:00:02,630 --> 01:00:04,199
Think the same for marriage.

753
01:00:04,839 --> 01:00:07,739
You can end it whenever, and it can end whenever.

754
01:00:08,270 --> 01:00:09,810
It's okay if you break up.

755
01:00:10,770 --> 01:00:11,909
It's not the end of the world.

756
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:16,449
That's how you keep some tension in your marriage...

757
01:00:16,949 --> 01:00:20,719
and become more forgiving toward each other.

758
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:22,389
- Yes! - Yes.

759
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:31,029
Next, we will have the exchange...

760
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:33,460
of rings between the bride and groom.

761
01:01:04,429 --> 01:01:05,630
Great work today.

762
01:01:08,069 --> 01:01:10,000
I was nervous to death.

763
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:11,369
I could see that.

764
01:01:15,069 --> 01:01:16,139
You were cute.

765
01:01:20,839 --> 01:01:21,850
Well...

766
01:01:22,650 --> 01:01:23,909
By the way,

767
01:01:24,719 --> 01:01:27,719
until when do I need to wait?

768
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:49,040
If you endure anything three times, you'll be burned out in this era.

769
01:01:49,839 --> 01:01:51,940
What will you do if I burn out?

770
01:01:53,679 --> 01:01:57,949
Kim Sa Ra can continue walking...

771
01:01:58,380 --> 01:01:59,520
toward her path.

772
01:02:01,219 --> 01:02:04,619
I'll follow you in the same direction.

773
01:02:17,630 --> 01:02:18,699
No.

774
01:02:21,739 --> 01:02:22,739
What?

775
01:02:23,270 --> 01:02:24,739
I don't want to get married anymore.

776
01:02:31,279 --> 01:02:32,279
Then what?

777
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:34,319
Let's break up.

778
01:02:35,549 --> 01:02:36,549
What?

779
01:02:37,790 --> 01:02:39,759
Let's break up after living five years together.

780
01:02:41,630 --> 01:02:43,429
If it's a marriage with an expiry date, I'm okay with it.

781
01:02:45,929 --> 01:02:47,060
Is marriage...

782
01:02:48,630 --> 01:02:50,630
- canned food? - That's what I'm saying.

783
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:54,400
The expiry date is on canned foods, but why not for marriage?

784
01:02:57,069 --> 01:02:58,139
I have a question.

785
01:02:59,779 --> 01:03:01,279
What if I want to continue to be with you?

786
01:03:03,949 --> 01:03:04,949
If...

787
01:03:07,619 --> 01:03:09,690
that miracle happens,

788
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:15,790
we can marry again.

789
01:03:16,560 --> 01:03:19,060
It'll have another five years of expiry date.

790
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:22,830
Wait, let me think.

791
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:29,310
Okay, fine.

792
01:03:31,279 --> 01:03:34,139
I have a goal. From today,

793
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:38,580
I'll get ten rings.

794
01:03:39,880 --> 01:03:40,920
For you.

795
01:04:10,850 --> 01:04:12,819
Let's become partners after a long time.

796
01:04:13,279 --> 01:04:14,319
A business partner.

797
01:04:16,750 --> 01:04:19,219
Not that, but a life partner.

798
01:04:20,119 --> 01:04:21,159
I tricked you.

799
01:04:26,460 --> 01:04:27,500
Never mind.

800
01:04:31,369 --> 01:04:32,369
I tricked you.

801
01:05:06,799 --> 01:05:08,710
(Queen of Divorce)

802
01:05:32,759 --> 01:05:35,198
The taste of getting stabbed in the back unexpectedly.

803
01:05:35,199 --> 01:05:36,568
Do something!

804
01:05:36,569 --> 01:05:39,499
You were like a thorn in my throat for a lifetime.

805
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:41,439
It's completely over for you.

806
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:42,769
Do you destroy families?

807
01:05:42,770 --> 01:05:45,338
You're manipulating an innocent woman. Why are you messing around?

808
01:05:45,339 --> 01:05:46,409
Bring the alimony.

809
01:05:46,509 --> 01:05:47,979
Admit your sins too.

810
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:50,580
If it's your request, I can do anything.

811
01:05:51,150 --> 01:05:52,150
Please divorce me.

812
01:05:52,151 --> 01:05:54,419
Are you doing this on purpose to avoid paying?

813
01:05:54,420 --> 01:05:56,948
If our company goes public, it'll be for Cheonji Dongsan.

814
01:05:56,949 --> 01:05:58,189
I'm more confident than anyone else...

815
01:05:58,190 --> 01:05:59,718
that I am the mother of those children.

816
01:05:59,719 --> 01:06:01,789
The dead lady didn't commit suicide.

817
01:06:01,790 --> 01:06:04,798
I'm happy if you're happy.

818
01:06:04,799 --> 01:06:06,329
I love you too, Mom.

819
01:06:06,330 --> 01:06:09,198
We'll cover your entry log to the casino.

820
01:06:09,199 --> 01:06:10,368
I'm in charge of this case.

821
01:06:10,369 --> 01:06:13,039
I'm reinvestigating Professor Seo's falling incident.

822
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:14,868
I heard you were having a lot of blind dates.

823
01:06:14,869 --> 01:06:16,269
Put me on the list too.

824
01:06:16,270 --> 01:06:18,278
I get furious whenever I see boiling water.

825
01:06:18,279 --> 01:06:20,879
I'm not that common-looking.

826
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:23,149
I'm upset. Upset like a dog.

827
01:06:23,150 --> 01:06:25,319
I have pride and money. I'm rich enough to pay for this.

828
01:06:25,779 --> 01:06:27,649
Don't forget that there are parents...

829
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:29,588
who even eat their own offspring.

830
01:06:29,589 --> 01:06:32,519
I just bite anyone...

831
01:06:32,520 --> 01:06:33,559
who shows their teeth.

832
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:34,928
What could happen if you move unnecessarily?

833
01:06:34,929 --> 01:06:36,658
You'll have to stay on your toes.

834
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:39,459
We have a list of surprises that will make you come to us...

835
01:06:39,460 --> 01:06:40,460
in shock.

836
01:06:40,461 --> 01:06:41,968
Is there a failure in marriage?

837
01:06:41,969 --> 01:06:43,669
No, our solution isn't over yet.

838
01:06:43,670 --> 01:06:45,100
Shall we see who'll win this time?

839
01:06:45,199 --> 01:06:46,539
Let's start.

840
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:47,698
The solution for this time is...

841
01:06:47,699 --> 01:06:49,040
(Thank you for watching Queen of Divorce.)
