I just heard about it. It's in her husband's study.

I ask you to reconsider.

54
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,729
She used to be a lawyer.

55
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:35,770

00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:42,118
Hello, sir.

182
00:14:42,119 --> 00:14:44,719
- Gosh. Hello. Happy birthday. - Thank you.

183
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,919
It's an honor to meet you, sir.

184
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:47,920
Sure.

185
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:52,489
I hear that your son is resourceful and capable as he takes after you.

186
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:54,290
Thank you.

187
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:56,398
- He's my grandson. - Say hello to him.

188
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,228
- Gosh. I see. - Hello.

189
00:14:58,229 --> 00:14:59,229
How adorable.

190
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:01,899
Hello.

191
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,868
I ask that you pass on your wisdom and insight to my son.

192
00:15:04,869 --> 00:15:06,040
Gosh. You're too kind.

193
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,408
I'll look forward to learn from you.

194
00:15:07,409 --> 00:15:10,379
- Sure. Happy birthday. - Thank you.

195
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:14,949
- Ma'am. Happy birthday. - Hello.

196
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:16,049
Thank you.

197
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:18,080
They're completely ignoring Kim Sa Ra.

198
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,089
She's at least a member of the royal family.

199
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:22,489
What about us? We're mere workers of Chayul Law Firm.

200
00:15:23,619 --> 00:15:25,019
What's the point of being in the royal family?

201
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,460
She has to take care of the law firm's dirty laundry.

202
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:30,329
She can't even join the board of directors.

203
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:33,669
Gosh. She's working hard for no reason.

204
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:37,368
Exactly. What else must I do other than...

205
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:38,609
just working hard?

206
00:15:38,909 --> 00:15:41,469
(Chayul Law Firm)

207
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:45,778
You got to have an extravagant meal. Why don't you give me some ideas?

208
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,180
Do you remember that idea of mine...

209
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,889
Gosh. Seriously. You're so awful.

210
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:01,158
Ma'am. We'll get going now.

211
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:04,228
Sure. You should have left sooner.

212
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:06,529
- I'll see you later. - Bye.

213
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,670
This is tasty.

214
00:16:44,999 --> 00:16:49,040
I wouldn't have any regrets even if I were to die right now.

215
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,850
My daughter is a lawyer now.

216
00:16:53,310 --> 00:16:56,550
She's always married to a very influential family too.

217
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:01,050
They're just people like us.

218
00:17:01,149 --> 00:17:03,419
Gosh. Just think about your dad.

219
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,258
He had lived his whole life, cooking and selling noodles.

220
00:17:05,259 --> 00:17:07,128
Then all of a sudden, he wanted to build a factory.

221
00:17:07,129 --> 00:17:09,499
He got too excited and fell for it.

222
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,500
After that,

223
00:17:11,830 --> 00:17:12,830
he passed away.

224
00:17:14,129 --> 00:17:17,500
That's when Yul Seong showed up.

225
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:20,109
He got us this restaurant.

226
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,679
He asked for my permission to marry you.

227
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:24,679
Gosh.

228
00:17:27,609 --> 00:17:29,719
So you're happy now, right?

229
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:41,060
Why are you asking me that?

230
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:43,800
You should ask that yourself.

231
00:17:48,699 --> 00:17:49,899
You know,

232
00:17:51,199 --> 00:17:53,639
I'm happy when you're happy.

233
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,840
If you're not happy,

234
00:17:58,439 --> 00:18:00,250
I'm not happy at all.

235
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:04,618
So don't hold yourself back...

236
00:18:04,619 --> 00:18:06,919
or put up with anyone for my sake.

237
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:09,219
You don't have to do that.

238
00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:57,100
I'm home.

239
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:05,580
Mother. Did you like your birthday party?

240
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,189
Did you go and see your mother?

241
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:17,990
Just briefly.

242
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:20,958
I told you to take a bath before coming down...

243
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,560
after visiting your mother.

244
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,730
You smell like food.

245
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,369
Mother.

246
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,699
Address me as the chairman. How many times must I repeat myself?

247
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,639
All this time,

248
00:19:34,270 --> 00:19:35,708
I put up with your treatment of me...

249
00:19:35,709 --> 00:19:37,179
to get your approval out of sheer determination.

250
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,949
I'm sure you know I've done my best to please you.

251
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:42,879
Everyone can do their best.

252
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:47,350
Why aren't you ironing my son's underwear these days?

253
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:53,928
He's my husband. I'll take care of him.

254
00:19:53,929 --> 00:19:55,999
The most pathetic type of woman is...

255
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,729
the one who wants to be respected as the wife of a rich man...

256
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,469
while not taking care of him properly.

257
00:19:59,869 --> 00:20:02,270
Why must I teach you every single thing?

258
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:12,550
What's wrong? Is something wrong?

259
00:20:13,949 --> 00:20:17,480
Can you tell your mother to stop bringing up the food smell?

260
00:20:19,689 --> 00:20:21,418
Can't you just do what she asks?

261
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:22,820
Washing up before going down isn't that hard.

262
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:29,429
Honey. You don't see what the problem is, do you?

263
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,428
Why are you asking me...

264
00:20:33,429 --> 00:20:36,869
such a scary question this late at night?

265
00:20:38,909 --> 00:20:40,010
Can you hang that for me?

266
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:09,800
You're not taking it seriously again.

267
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,869
What can you actually get done on your own?

268
00:21:50,639 --> 00:21:52,179
Mommy is all right.

269
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:56,119
I'm happy as long as I have you, Seo Yun.

270
00:22:17,139 --> 00:22:19,010
Increase my allowance.

271
00:22:19,270 --> 00:22:21,240
I can't survive with 200 dollars a month.

272
00:22:25,909 --> 00:22:27,780
What's the point of increasing my wife's allowance?

273
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,149
She'll only think about hanging out with other younger guys.

274
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,790
Can you stop with those comments?

275
00:22:41,189 --> 00:22:43,928
Don't you know there are so many guys going after...

276
00:22:43,929 --> 00:22:45,570
rich and foolish women like you?

277
00:22:48,469 --> 00:22:51,139
If I'm earning billions of dollars as a plastic surgeon,

278
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,070
just be happy to support me as my wife.

279
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,448
I paid for that spinach in your soup.

280
00:23:00,449 --> 00:23:01,879
I'll take it back then.

281
00:23:04,179 --> 00:23:05,589
I'm going to look for a part-time job at a supermarket.

282
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:07,388
What kind of woman lives with 200 dollars a month?

283
00:23:07,389 --> 00:23:08,619
- Hey! - An elementary school kid...

284
00:23:08,889 --> 00:23:11,718
- probably will get more than that. - I won't let you go tonight.

285
00:23:11,719 --> 00:23:14,359
- Get over here. Now! - Honey!

286
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:17,429
- Gosh! Honey! - How dare you?

287
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:19,100
Honey!

288
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:20,770
Get back here!

289
00:23:23,169 --> 00:23:25,839
How dare you talk back to me while I'm eating?

290
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,770
Honey, stop! I get it!

291
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:31,909
Honey!

292
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:33,909
Get down!

293
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,149
What are you looking at?

294
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,919
You're pathetic.

295
00:23:41,649 --> 00:23:43,059
It's time, isn't it?

296
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,090
Right.

297
00:23:45,219 --> 00:23:46,760
Let's go for it.

298
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:48,659
Hey!

299
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:57,800
You want to take Director Kim Tae Hyuk's divorce suit?

300
00:23:58,369 --> 00:23:59,469
If we win the suit,

301
00:24:00,010 --> 00:24:02,009
we can take all of Director Kim's cases.

302
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:03,579
He'll be a handful of trouble.

303
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:06,309
Room salon violence, first-class seat disturbance,

304
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:08,649
abuse of power on driver, and road rage.

305
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,580
He's the definition of owner risk.

306
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:14,949
We can never win this suit.

307
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:21,388
This is Chayul Law Firm.

308
00:24:21,389 --> 00:24:23,530
How can you give up so easily?

309
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:26,070
Please hand this one over to Lawyer Ma.

310
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,669
I want to maintain a higher winning rate, Chairwoman Cha.

311
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:35,368
Director Park will be moving to Yongsan next month.

312
00:24:35,369 --> 00:24:36,580
Win the suit, no matter what.

313
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:38,580
Then the vacant director's position...

314
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:40,609
will be yours.

315
00:24:45,719 --> 00:24:46,750
Are you serious, Mother?

316
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,760
Then,

317
00:24:54,389 --> 00:24:55,830
please promise me one more thing.

318
00:24:57,859 --> 00:25:01,030
If I win the suit, please let me call you Mother.

319
00:25:01,869 --> 00:25:02,969
I'll take the case if you promise me this.

320
00:25:07,409 --> 00:25:08,769
(Injury Certificate)

321
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:11,709
These are the documents prepared by the wife to use as evidence.

322
00:25:17,050 --> 00:25:18,149
How did you get all this?

323
00:25:20,419 --> 00:25:22,218
Be ready for me if you move somewhere else.

324
00:25:22,219 --> 00:25:23,418
I'll put you on the wanted list.

325
00:25:23,419 --> 00:25:25,019
You know what will happen when you run away.

326
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,830
I'll always move with you.

327
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,459
This is the key point of this suit.

328
00:25:32,129 --> 00:25:33,699
Parental and fostering rights.

329
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:35,699
We need to find the reasons for liability of the wife's side.

330
00:25:37,199 --> 00:25:39,070
But the child is five years old.

331
00:25:39,469 --> 00:25:41,469
Will it be right to live under a dad like that?

332
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,209
He's been a violent husband.

333
00:25:46,609 --> 00:25:47,908
It doesn't feel right.

334
00:25:47,909 --> 00:25:49,750
We don't judge our clients.

335
00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:52,820
We only find a way to win.

336
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,108
Help!

337
00:26:14,109 --> 00:26:16,980
This is the footage of the plaintiff's escape last month.

338
00:26:17,879 --> 00:26:20,179
That night, the plaintiff was beaten by her husband.

339
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,879
She got away without being able to put on any shoes.

340
00:26:23,449 --> 00:26:24,519
It was self-fabricated.

341
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,149
There weren't any witnesses.

342
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:29,719
It's because the housekeepers are keeping their mouths shut.

343
00:26:29,959 --> 00:26:33,030
There were seven more cases of violence other than that.

344
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:35,059
There are 32 photos of evidence.

345
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,129
(Photos of Son Jang Mi's wounds)

346
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:38,800
We acknowledge the defendant's cases of violence.

347
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,399
Seven cases do seem like a lot.

348
00:26:41,969 --> 00:26:45,399
But how did the defendant feel during those seven cases?

349
00:26:45,939 --> 00:26:49,408
The pieces of evidence that felt shameful to be brought up by a man.

350
00:26:49,409 --> 00:26:51,740
These unrevealed pieces of evidence...

351
00:26:51,879 --> 00:26:53,209
will be revealed now.

352
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,819
(Photos of Kim Tae Hyuk's wounds)

353
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,879
(Photos of Kim Tae Hyuk's wounds)

354
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:02,859
- Did you fight back? - No.

355
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:04,290
What is all that?

356
00:27:05,929 --> 00:27:07,490
He even beat himself?

357
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:09,059
(Plaintiff, lawyer)

358
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,658
I have an objection, your Honor.

359
00:27:10,659 --> 00:27:12,570
Your Honor, the important fact...

360
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:16,169
is that both sides use violence when worked up.

361
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:18,240
This is nonsense!

362
00:27:18,939 --> 00:27:20,609
They're all lies!

363
00:27:22,169 --> 00:27:24,178
If Defendant Kim Tae Hyuk takes the fostering rights,

364
00:27:24,179 --> 00:27:26,879
a professional tutor will educate the child.

365
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,119
As for Plaintiff Son Jang Mi,

366
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:31,378
the child will stay with her mother all day...

367
00:27:31,379 --> 00:27:33,189
who is a housewife.

368
00:27:33,449 --> 00:27:35,519
If both sides are to use violence,

369
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,918
which side would be safer for the child...

370
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:40,158
and have a lower possibility of violence?

371
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,429
Please take that into consideration.

372
00:27:41,929 --> 00:27:44,159
Why would I beat my own child?

373
00:27:44,459 --> 00:27:47,070
I went through a tough process of IVF to have my child.

374
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,270
Why would I do that?

375
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:58,979
The evidence to prove that it was not both sides involved...

376
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:00,679
in using violence will be submitted at the next trial.

377
00:28:01,149 --> 00:28:03,780
But before that, please take a look at this video.

378
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,129
Well,

379
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:15,859
it's the most pathetic thing to do in the world.

380
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:20,429
Taking pictures of your husband in an affair.

381
00:28:21,429 --> 00:28:24,300
But this won't work as evidence of an affair.

382
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:27,070
All of this?

383
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:30,379
Why not? Look at him with all these women.

384
00:28:31,179 --> 00:28:32,879
Conversations, voice recordings, and text messages.

385
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:36,619
You need these things to make it work.

386
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:42,590
Hold on.

387
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:44,389
What?

388
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:46,560
What is it?

389
00:28:47,629 --> 00:28:48,689
I guess this could work.

390
00:28:49,129 --> 00:28:50,129
What could work?

391
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:53,330
This guy will be sensitive to rumors.

392
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,510
What? What is all this?

393
00:28:59,669 --> 00:29:02,580
This has not been prearranged, Your Honor.

394
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:05,510
Lawyers of both sides, please come up.

395
00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:15,888
Will you continue to carry things on like this?

396
00:29:15,889 --> 00:29:18,259
Your Honor, this is an invasion of privacy...

397
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,928
and evident slander.

398
00:29:19,929 --> 00:29:23,398
This is an important piece of evidence that can prove...

399
00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:24,699
who is more responsible.

400
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:31,799
(Judge)

401
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,010
It will be accepted as evidence.

402
00:29:33,209 --> 00:29:34,669
Please head back to your seats.

403
00:29:45,879 --> 00:29:47,849
The two are very close friends.

404
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:50,020
That is all that can explain the two of them.

405
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:52,419
A middle-aged man and woman who are known to be just friends...

406
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:54,929
are touching each other affectionately.

407
00:29:55,129 --> 00:29:56,929
I wonder if I'm in a trial in Hollywood right now.

408
00:29:57,699 --> 00:30:00,929
If family cases could be turned into jury trials,

409
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,770
I would love to ask for the people's opinions.

410
00:30:09,939 --> 00:30:11,009
Gosh, what do we do?

411
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:14,549
If things go on like this, the scandal between us and them...

412
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:17,219
will spread everywhere.

413
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:22,149
But Director Kim is ten years younger than you.

414
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,689
What are you on about?

415
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:25,260
Director Kim is just...

416
00:30:28,990 --> 00:30:31,799
Forget it. You don't have to worry about that lousy photo.

417
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,330
Just find more evidence that will help us win.

418
00:30:33,699 --> 00:30:35,070
What if there are strange rumors?

419
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,599
Win the divorce suit first.

420
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,869
There will be a way to get things straight.

421
00:30:46,649 --> 00:30:47,679
Yes?

422
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,320

Are you Kim Tae Hyuk's lawyer?

426
00:31:50,709 --> 00:31:51,780
Yes.

427
00:31:54,409 --> 00:31:57,118
There has been a violation of the law of drugs...

428
00:31:57,119 --> 00:31:59,449
based on the distribution and supply of propopol.

429
00:31:59,719 --> 00:32:01,419
A search and seizure has been proceeded.

430
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:03,320
Everything has been explained.

431
00:32:03,459 --> 00:32:05,790
Please ask Director Kim for the details.

Let's proceed with things a bit quicker.

435

What is this about?

If it's Chayul Law Firm you're asking about,

437
00:33:03,879 --> 00:33:05,780
I know a few managers there.

438
00:33:06,389 --> 00:33:09,049
Just tell them this.

439
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:10,519
If they are to help Kim Tae Hyuk,

440
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,329
tell them to know the lies he made...

441
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:14,530
to get himself married.

442
00:33:14,629 --> 00:33:16,300
Yes. Understood.

Lawyer Kim.

445
00:33:27,709 --> 00:33:30,209
He was already done cleaning up his books.

446
00:33:30,310 --> 00:33:32,080
The prosecution won't be able to get anything from him.

447
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:37,550
Apparently, Director Kim Tae Hyuk likes men.

448
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,020
What?

449
00:33:41,021 --> 00:33:43,158
The propopol case was related to a gay bar too.

450
00:33:43,159 --> 00:33:45,320
Any recommendations from that place led to a discount for the shots.

451
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:50,929
Was that why Chairwoman Cha was okay with the touching?

452
00:33:51,629 --> 00:33:52,800
But that's strange.

453
00:33:52,899 --> 00:33:55,569

454
00:33:55,570 --> 00:33:57,139

Please do me a favor.

457
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:05,879
Of course.

This way.

459
00:34:17,259 --> 00:34:19,690
Did the board of directors meet today?

460
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:21,690
I'm checking right now.

461
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:23,830
Yes. It happened today.

462
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:26,469
What about the vacant position of Director Park?

463
00:34:27,469 --> 00:34:28,469
Well...

464
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,339
It has been given to Lawyer Ma.

465
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:52,019
You promised me the director's position.

466
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,459

469
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,469
The next opportunity? When could that be?

470
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,409
Were you even considering it in the first place?

471
00:35:08,869 --> 00:35:11,440
Were you willing to let me call you Mother?

472
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:15,879
Was that why you married into our family?

473
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:16,919
Why is that important?

474
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,279
You knew all about it, right?

475
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,920
That Director Kim can't be in a married relationship.

476
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,500
You knew all along that it was a fraudulent marriage.

477
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,569
Yet, you still told me to win the suit.

478
00:35:34,569 --> 00:35:36,940
Solely to win your favor,

479
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,739
I innocently stayed up all night to prepare for the trial.

480
00:35:44,179 --> 00:35:47,210
So what? What is it that you want?

481
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,049
From now on,

482
00:35:54,549 --> 00:35:58,159
I must do some thinking.

483
00:36:10,139 --> 00:36:12,368
Are you still into Kim Sa Ra?

484
00:36:12,369 --> 00:36:15,439
Why are you bringing that up again? Did something happen?

485
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,638
There are dogs that growl if they aren't fed.

486
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:18,810
Do you know why?

487
00:36:18,909 --> 00:36:21,810
They think they're above their coddling owners.

488
00:36:21,909 --> 00:36:24,278
We won't have any ill-behaved dogs in our household.

489
00:36:24,279 --> 00:36:25,380
Keep that in mind.

490
00:37:11,259 --> 00:37:14,969
Your Honor, we ask to cancel the request...

491
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:16,539
to submit evidence.

492
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:18,040
Are you talking about the video material?

493
00:37:18,139 --> 00:37:20,940
Yes. We have learned something new about the defendant.

494
00:37:21,509 --> 00:37:23,579
The defendant has no reason...

495
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:26,710
to affectionately touch a female.

496
00:37:29,719 --> 00:37:30,850
What?

497
00:37:32,449 --> 00:37:34,920
What is she saying?

498
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:37,819
This is all nonsense.

499
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:50,600
It's better for Director Kim to have that footage exposed.

500
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:55,040
At least, he'll be safe from being found out gay.

501
00:37:56,409 --> 00:37:58,909
Of course. It will be over once that gets exposed.

502
00:38:01,179 --> 00:38:03,979
Once that happens, parenting rights, fostering rights,

503
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,549
and the claim for division of property...

504
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:11,219
Everything will be in favor of the wife.

505
00:38:11,319 --> 00:38:12,360
I'll call you again.

506
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,500
Excuse me.

507
00:38:17,799 --> 00:38:19,529
What were you talking about?

508
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:21,368
What about my husband?

509
00:38:21,369 --> 00:38:24,540
If you heard me clear, my work here is done.

510
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:25,940
Goodbye.

511
00:38:26,369 --> 00:38:30,380
Lawyer Kim. Is this really true?

512
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:33,549
You went out taking pictures of him having an affair.

513
00:38:34,049 --> 00:38:35,649
Weren't you suspicious of something?

514
00:38:35,650 --> 00:38:37,279
But I never expected him to be...

515
00:38:41,589 --> 00:38:44,389
But why are you telling me all this?

516
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:47,630
You came to me on purpose, right?

517
00:38:48,429 --> 00:38:49,960
In the world of divorce,

518
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:53,199
the ones who suffered and were sacrificed...

519
00:38:54,529 --> 00:38:57,169
must finish things with one fatal blow.

520
00:38:57,170 --> 00:38:58,500
That's justice.

521
00:39:01,069 --> 00:39:05,110
I hope you will be able to protect your child.

522
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:25,899
What are you talking about? That's a lie.

523
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:27,529
She's slandering me!

524
00:39:27,969 --> 00:39:29,900
Do something.

525
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:35,440
Your Honor, her claim has not been proven.

526
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:41,508
I have deeply considered whether to expose this claim,

527
00:39:41,509 --> 00:39:42,649
to be honest.

528
00:39:42,650 --> 00:39:44,980
However, the defendant's gender identity...

529
00:39:45,219 --> 00:39:48,190
is a crucial factor to the breakdown of marriage.

530
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,420
The evidence of the male bias of the defendant...

531
00:39:51,759 --> 00:39:53,019
will additionally be submitted.

532
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:54,529
I can't believe this.

533
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:57,560
This is an invalid trial.

534
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,429
What kind of trial is this?

535
00:40:00,529 --> 00:40:02,269
Why did you get married with me?

536
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:06,338
We could've just lived as strangers following the things we wanted!

537
00:40:06,339 --> 00:40:09,068
- You could've just gone your way! - Keep quiet!

538
00:40:09,069 --> 00:40:11,738
- You could've just left me alone! - Please calm down.

539
00:40:11,739 --> 00:40:14,678
Why would you mess things up like this?

540
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:16,679
This is so embarrassing.

541
00:40:36,869 --> 00:40:39,739
This a new dish they came up with. It's not bad.

542
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:40,940
Give it a try.

543
00:40:45,279 --> 00:40:49,379
The medical suits given to us by Director Kim.

544
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:52,480
He's making a big deal wanting out with us.

545
00:40:53,819 --> 00:40:55,448
What about the Legislation and Judiciary Committee chairman?

546
00:40:55,449 --> 00:40:58,219
- Hello, Chairman. - Oh, hello. Congratulations.

547
00:40:59,319 --> 00:41:02,630
They're being strict there for some reason. Gosh.

548
00:41:03,429 --> 00:41:06,769
I need to come up with a plan.

549
00:41:06,770 --> 00:41:08,629
He needs to change the law...

550
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:10,699
for there to be more law schools. Don't forget that.

551
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,069
That needs to happen...

552
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:16,679
for us to set up Chayul Town.

553
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:23,718
- Who is this? - It's his daughter.

554
00:41:23,719 --> 00:41:27,219
Besides her having a divorce, she's perfect.

555
00:41:28,049 --> 00:41:30,619
Is there a better plan to win that strict man's favor...

556
00:41:30,889 --> 00:41:32,690
than this?

557
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:35,630
You've had it your way with your first marriage.

558
00:41:36,929 --> 00:41:39,259
Do it right this time.

559
00:41:41,799 --> 00:41:43,270
You want me to get married?

560
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:48,339
- What about Sa Ra? - Why think about her?

561
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:52,909
You two have gotten a divorce a while ago.

562
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:59,920
She'll be getting that much from him?

563
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:02,819
The division of property for Director Kim Tae Hyuk's wife.

564
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:06,218
Director Kim is wealthy. That's why she'll get a lot from him.

565
00:42:06,219 --> 00:42:09,159
Gosh. You're a brave one, Sa Ra.

566
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:12,230
If the chairwoman finds out about this... Goodness.

567
00:42:12,929 --> 00:42:14,428
My mom said this to me.

568
00:42:14,429 --> 00:42:16,429
If I'm happy, she's happy.

569
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:22,339
I want to be a good daughter that does what she wants.

570
00:42:23,139 --> 00:42:24,179
Sounds good.

571
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:28,079
About Director Kim's identity.

572
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:29,350
How did you know about it in advance?

573
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:32,080
There's someone I know.

574
00:42:33,619 --> 00:42:35,489
This person can't stand watching bad people take the win.

575
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:39,218
(Lawyer Kim Sa Ra)

576
00:42:39,219 --> 00:42:40,230
Hey, Secretary Lee.

577
00:42:45,159 --> 00:42:46,559
What are you talking about?

578
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,129
The foreign affairs department of the Prosecutor's Office...

579
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:50,298
are widening their investigation of illicit admission...

580
00:42:50,299 --> 00:42:53,099
of social leaders' children to international schools.

581
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:55,839
To qualify for the condition of one parent being a foreigner,

582
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,479
a nationality fraud has happened?

583
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,679
Yes. That's right.

584
00:42:58,779 --> 00:43:02,448
The wife gets divorced in disguise in Korea.

585
00:43:02,449 --> 00:43:04,678
She then gets married in disguise with a foreigner from places like...

586
00:43:04,679 --> 00:43:05,979
Ethiopia or Ecuador.

587
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:08,249
After illicit admission of their child,

588
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:09,419
the husband and wife get back together.

589
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:10,790
What's this all about the international school?

590
00:43:11,389 --> 00:43:13,218
Did you apply without me knowing?

591
00:43:13,219 --> 00:43:15,888
Did you expect me to let my grandson...

592
00:43:15,889 --> 00:43:17,529
study with lowly kids?

593
00:43:20,569 --> 00:43:24,040
Well, that's not what's important.

594
00:43:26,569 --> 00:43:29,009
Are we also caught for illicit admission?

595
00:43:29,110 --> 00:43:31,479
How did you get Seo Yun into that school?

596
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,380
Mother, so that case...

597
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:37,020
So...

598
00:43:38,250 --> 00:43:40,020
I said we should be careful with this.

599
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:42,089
You knew about it?

600
00:43:44,219 --> 00:43:45,589
Does this make sense?

601
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:49,360
It can't be true.

602
00:43:51,659 --> 00:43:55,270
You said you'd correct some register...

603
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:57,839
and took my personal seal.

604
00:43:59,699 --> 00:44:01,569
- It's not related to that, right? - Stop the fuss.

605
00:44:01,770 --> 00:44:03,610
Why are you acting as if it's a big deal?

606
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:05,839
What do you mean?

607
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:07,949
This is a big deal!

608
00:44:09,549 --> 00:44:12,218
Honey, this means I unknowingly...

609
00:44:12,219 --> 00:44:14,219
went through a fake divorce.

610
00:44:14,449 --> 00:44:16,489
I've become the mom who falsified my child's admission.

611
00:44:16,619 --> 00:44:18,060
Just be ready.

612
00:44:19,659 --> 00:44:20,830
Be ready for what?

613
00:44:20,929 --> 00:44:23,330
If things go wrong, you'd need to be responsible.

614
00:44:24,199 --> 00:44:25,258
Me?

615
00:44:25,259 --> 00:44:27,729
Do you think I or he would go to prison?

616
00:44:27,730 --> 00:44:28,770
Who'll be in charge of the company?

617
00:44:29,299 --> 00:44:31,400
- Chairwoman Cha! - Regarding this matter...

618
00:44:32,199 --> 00:44:34,509
He and I weren't aware of this.

619
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:35,810
You did everything alone.

620
00:44:38,239 --> 00:44:41,080
Honey, say something!

621
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:43,980
Why are you overreacting?

622
00:44:44,179 --> 00:44:46,619
It'll most probably end as a summary indictment.

623
00:44:58,500 --> 00:45:01,029
- This is a reporter from... - How are you feeling?

624
00:45:08,869 --> 00:45:10,339
(Korea Video Journalist Association)

625
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,509
(Court)

626
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:26,659
Did you plan this from the start?

627
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:29,360
We go through a fake divorce,

628
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:33,400
send her to prison, and get a real divorce.

629
00:45:33,569 --> 00:45:35,069
Were you able to control her...

630
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:37,369
before or after the marriage?

631
00:45:38,199 --> 00:45:40,100
I know that your heart belongs to her...

632
00:45:40,509 --> 00:45:42,809
even though you have fun with others.

633
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:45,540
But she isn't the type who can be controlled.

634
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:47,449
So give up.

635
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:48,880
Mother.

636
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:51,618
She's Seo Yun's birthmother.

637
00:45:51,619 --> 00:45:53,419
How can you accomplish anything significant...

638
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:55,489
when you're caught up in such trivial relationships?

639
00:45:56,690 --> 00:45:57,690
Anything significant?

640
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:07,999
(Plaque of Appreciation for Social Contribution)

641
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:09,199
Oh, right.

642
00:46:09,369 --> 00:46:10,699
I need to do that.

643
00:46:13,199 --> 00:46:14,339
But Mother.

644
00:46:15,670 --> 00:46:18,980
Do you believe that I can accomplish anything significant?

645
00:46:19,139 --> 00:46:21,179
"This is your problem."

646
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:22,849
"You can't do it because of this and that."

647
00:46:22,850 --> 00:46:26,350
These are what I've heard from you for my whole life.

648
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:28,520
Only now,

649
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:33,159
you're saying I need to accomplish something significant...

650
00:46:34,259 --> 00:46:35,630
and abandon Sa Ra.

651
00:46:38,429 --> 00:46:40,130
I'm confused.

652
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:48,369
If you handle this divorce and remarriage well,

653
00:46:50,139 --> 00:46:51,210
I will acknowledge you.

654
00:47:07,429 --> 00:47:08,489
Where is Seo Yun?

655
00:47:10,029 --> 00:47:12,029
He'll be shocked to be in a place like this.

656
00:47:30,949 --> 00:47:31,980
But...

657
00:47:33,889 --> 00:47:35,889
why do I need to be responsible for all this alone?

658
00:47:38,759 --> 00:47:41,158
The broker has made all the statements,

659
00:47:41,159 --> 00:47:42,929
saying that you are the main culprit.

660
00:47:43,330 --> 00:47:44,899
I didn't plan any of this.

661
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:46,460
You know that!

662
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,669
The judges probably have their considerations too.

663
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:50,299
- Just wait. - Honey.

664
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:54,110
Aren't you here to defend me?

665
00:47:57,810 --> 00:47:59,339
Don't call me that anymore.

666
00:48:04,020 --> 00:48:05,020
What?

667
00:48:05,819 --> 00:48:08,989
We're already divorced.

668
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:10,489
Let's make it clear.

669
00:48:14,029 --> 00:48:16,130
Let's just follow the law.

670
00:48:16,589 --> 00:48:19,730
A divorce with a seal...

671
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:22,330
is irreversible by Korean law.

672
00:48:23,230 --> 00:48:24,839
If you've committed a crime,

673
00:48:26,139 --> 00:48:28,069
receiving punishment is the law.

674
00:48:31,009 --> 00:48:32,080
How about Seo Yun?

675
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:34,449
The custody rights are...

676
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:38,448
legally documented as being in my possession.

677
00:48:38,449 --> 00:48:40,520
How could you do this to me?

678
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:44,889
Don't be emotional.

679
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:48,560
Listen and think carefully.

680
00:48:48,929 --> 00:48:52,130
What is the lifelong mission of our household?

681
00:48:52,929 --> 00:48:55,000
Establishing a law school...

682
00:48:55,969 --> 00:48:57,600
and building Chayul Town.

683
00:48:57,670 --> 00:48:59,068
If these go well,

684
00:48:59,069 --> 00:49:02,638
you, me, and Seo Yun can live happily for many years.

685
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:03,908
You know that, right?

686
00:49:03,909 --> 00:49:05,439
So our divorce is...

687
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,849
never for me.

688
00:49:07,850 --> 00:49:09,509
It's for the three of us.

689
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:14,020
So...

690
00:49:14,690 --> 00:49:16,250
what's all this about?

691
00:49:16,449 --> 00:49:17,589
Does this make sense to you?

692
00:49:18,659 --> 00:49:21,630
How is that business related to our divorce?

693
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:26,130
Look. I'll become...

694
00:49:28,869 --> 00:49:30,699
the son-in-law of the Chairman of Legislation and Judiciary Committee.

695
00:49:31,569 --> 00:49:32,569
Okay?

696
00:49:33,299 --> 00:49:35,310
This is why I told you not to be emotional.

697
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:37,940
Our divorce...

698
00:49:39,210 --> 00:49:41,278
is just arranged.

699
00:49:41,279 --> 00:49:43,079
We just got rid of the married couple tag.

700
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:44,778
I'll make sure you have...

701
00:49:44,779 --> 00:49:46,948
everything that you had when we were married.

702
00:49:46,949 --> 00:49:49,989
House, car, and living expenses.

703
00:49:50,219 --> 00:49:52,189
Tell me whatever you need.

704
00:49:52,190 --> 00:49:53,360
Nothing is going to change.

705
00:50:01,699 --> 00:50:02,730
So...

706
00:50:05,339 --> 00:50:06,400
you're openly asking...

707
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,810
me to be your second wife?

708
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:13,610
What? Second wife?

709
00:50:16,250 --> 00:50:18,618
What second wife?

710
00:50:18,619 --> 00:50:19,619
Sa Ra.

711
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:22,850
You're the only first...

712
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:26,790
in my life.

713
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:31,860
If you accept this reality,

714
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:35,529
everyone will be at peace.

715
00:50:36,170 --> 00:50:37,339
Everyone will be happy.

716
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,100
I can give up on everything,

717
00:50:41,310 --> 00:50:42,739
but not Seo Yun.

718
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:49,609
Once Seo Yun declines contact,

719
00:50:49,610 --> 00:50:51,319
it's over. You know that.

720
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:54,949

01:05:18,179 --> 01:05:20,579
My husband will lose in the trial anyway.

905
01:05:20,580 --> 01:05:22,650
Which law firm is the husband working with?

906
01:05:22,850 --> 01:05:24,349
It's Chayul Law Firm.

907
01:05:24,350 --> 01:05:25,718
I disagree with taking this case.

908
01:05:25,719 --> 01:05:27,889
- I disagree too. - Let's do this.

909
01:05:27,989 --> 01:05:29,060
The other party is...

910
01:05:31,159 --> 01:05:32,199
Chayul Law Firm.
