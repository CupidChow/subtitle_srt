00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:18,420
(E Ji Ah)

2
00:00:18,789 --> 00:00:20,090
(Kang Ki Young)

3
00:00:25,929 --> 00:00:27,600
(Oh Min Suk)

4
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:44,039
(Queen of Divorce)

5
00:00:44,209 --> 00:00:45,279
Hello?

6
00:00:46,209 --> 00:00:48,649
Sa Ra, your shirt is still in the car.

7
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:51,389
Tell me your address. I'll give it to you.

8
00:00:52,389 --> 00:00:54,560
It's okay. It's on my way home.

9
00:00:55,459 --> 00:00:56,520
All right.

10
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:12,640
Ms. Kim.

11
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:14,339
Hey.

12
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:18,949
What brings you here at this hour?

13
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,080
Well,

14
00:01:21,679 --> 00:01:22,679
Ms. Kim.

15
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:24,990
Is something wrong?

16
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:28,819
Could you give me a hug? Just one hug.

17
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,589
What?

18
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:34,360
Okay.

19
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:44,910
What's wrong?

20
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:46,610
I heard you caught the blackmailers.

21
00:01:57,949 --> 00:01:58,949
Okay.

22
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:50,939
(Episode 5)

23
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:51,970
Are you all right?

24
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,509
What's wrong?

25
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:06,850
What's this?

26
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,168
(Recipient: Kwon Dae Gi, acute myeloid leukemia)

27
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:23,668
(Donor: Kim Sa Ra, Marital status: Unmarried)

28
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:24,739
Wait.

29
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,509
That was you?

30
00:03:28,039 --> 00:03:29,840
I'm talking about stem cell donations.

31
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:34,619
I forgot that I registered as a donor.

32
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,319
You did it ten years ago.

33
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:39,350
We recently got a patient who's a DNA match to you.

34
00:03:44,889 --> 00:03:47,660
If you don't want to do it, you can turn it down.

35
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,370
But the patient must be very desperate to find a donor.

36
00:03:52,229 --> 00:03:53,900
Once the surgery gets scheduled,

37
00:03:54,329 --> 00:03:56,340
we can apply for parole.

38
00:03:58,069 --> 00:03:59,209
I can get out?

39
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:00,409
There's a precedent for that.

40
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:03,940
Your prison term is almost over. So I'm sure it will be accepted.

41
00:04:09,549 --> 00:04:12,150
You saved my life.

42
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,220
Actually, the truth is...

43
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:22,429
I wanted to be released early from prison too.

44
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,999
But how did you find out that I was the donor?

45
00:04:27,939 --> 00:04:30,539
Well, I guess you can call it white hat hacking.

46
00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:32,369
I wanted to repay you.

47
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:35,280
Gosh.

48
00:04:35,739 --> 00:04:38,950
Is that why you applied to work at SOLUTION on purpose?

49
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:40,549
Yes.

50
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,549
Wait. So your health is fine now. Right?

51
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,049
Yes. I'm perfectly fine.

52
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:59,570
Then you're the person I met when I was in my darkest time.

53
00:05:02,669 --> 00:05:04,609
Will there be a tomorrow?

54
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:09,580
Will I be able to meet someone who is my DNA match tomorrow?

55
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:14,179
I pray every day in tears.

56
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,489
Every night, I wished that tomorrow wouldn't come.

57
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:21,259
But after reading the journals from patients,

58
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,660
it made me think more deeply.

59
00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:25,960
To patients, tomorrow was...

60
00:05:26,289 --> 00:05:29,760
one more day they had earned after praying and hoping.

61
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,900
So I changed my mind.

62
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:36,669
To live.

63
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,179
If I give up, it's only my loss.

64
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:48,679
By the way, why are you suddenly bringing this up?

65
00:05:49,619 --> 00:05:51,288
Gosh. I'm sure you know me by now.

66
00:05:51,289 --> 00:05:53,820
Keeping a secret is my Achilles heel.

67
00:05:54,119 --> 00:05:56,260
I will make sure to repay you.

68
00:05:56,559 --> 00:05:57,590
Your blood...

69
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,390
is flowing through my body.

70
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,080
Having a touching moment was enough for tonight.

71
00:06:04,359 --> 00:06:06,569
A scary moment this late at night isn't suitable.

72
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:07,850
Okay. It was a bit weird, right?

73
00:06:45,809 --> 00:06:46,868
Hello.

74
00:06:46,869 --> 00:06:49,308
It's me. When will you get here?

75
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:50,340
Oh, that.

76
00:06:50,809 --> 00:06:53,249
Something just came up.

77
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:56,320
I'll give it back to you at work tomorrow.

78
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,049
- I see. Okay. Sure. - Okay.

79
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,129
Gosh.

80
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:14,330
I was totally getting ahead of myself...

81
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,710
when she wasn't on the same page.

82
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,010
This is embarrassing.

83
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:29,049
How embarrassing.

84
00:07:39,989 --> 00:07:42,298
When I went there, there were so many copies.

85
00:07:42,299 --> 00:07:43,858
So I pulled out each copy one at a time.

86
00:07:43,859 --> 00:07:46,529
I smashed them with a hammer. I destroyed all of them.

87
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:47,938
- That's so cool. - When the guys tried to fight back,

88
00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:50,069
I subdued with the tear gas.

89
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:53,010
After all that, I retrieved the original file.

90
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:54,710
That's so impressive.

91
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:56,580
That was an amazing feat.

92
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:00,210
Ms. Han asked me to thank you for everything you did.

93
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:02,918
I didn't think you were the type. But you did follow through.

94
00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:03,979
That was cool.

95
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,618
Gosh, Dae Gi. There's nothing you can't do.

96
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:07,820
Bam.

97
00:08:09,359 --> 00:08:12,059
I get why Ms. Kim likes you.

98
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,998
All right. Good work, everyone.

99
00:08:14,999 --> 00:08:17,200
Let's go back to putting pressure on Noh Yul Seong.

100
00:08:17,799 --> 00:08:19,029
Let's start with the abductors.

101
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:20,110
- Yes, ma'am. - Yes, ma'am.

102
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,700
Ms. Kim.

103
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:23,770
Right here. Wait.

104
00:08:30,309 --> 00:08:31,350
All clear.

105
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,179
- Have a good one. - Thanks.

106
00:08:38,489 --> 00:08:39,590
How did you find them?

107
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,800
They weren't girls this time. How did you find them?

108
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,159
It's a secret.

109
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:10,550
Your trump card to speed up your divorce.

110
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,475
I heard you had a private meeting with the party representative.

111
00:09:30,499 --> 00:09:32,619
But you failed to get her support for the nomination.

112
00:09:32,869 --> 00:09:35,478
Well, I had to plead with her to get a chance...

113
00:09:35,479 --> 00:09:37,040
to even compete.

114
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:40,179
Once you join the election,

115
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,349
the party members will vote for your opponent.

116
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:42,990
I heard she was supporting your opponent.

117
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:45,320
Listen, Mom.

118
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:47,550
If the tortoise...

119
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:51,489
wants to beat the hare, what should he do?

120
00:09:52,889 --> 00:09:55,569
If the race is being held on land, he must bring the race to water.

121
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:58,899
If he can't win the race, he must change the rules.

122
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:01,870
You want to change the rules of the election?

123
00:10:02,239 --> 00:10:03,839
Instead of holding a vote within the party,

124
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,439
we must have the people participate in the vote.

125
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,869
Then I will create a sensation with the public.

126
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,979
I'll get the public's approval and win by popularity.

127
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,811
I must look into the chairperson of the National Election Commission.

128
00:10:32,369 --> 00:10:34,840
Gosh. The weather is great. Isn't it?

129
00:10:37,239 --> 00:10:38,310
Hey.

130
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,239
What's this?

131
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:42,710
Gosh. I didn't start it. Hold on.

132
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,879
- I missed you. - Me too.

133
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:48,220
You look beautiful today.

134
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:49,850
I love you.

135
00:10:51,989 --> 00:10:52,989
How did you...

136
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:55,658
Why did you turn that off? We need to keep watching.

137
00:10:55,659 --> 00:10:57,759
He's about to call your name.

138
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,729
I told you, didn't I?

139
00:11:04,159 --> 00:11:06,070
Did I have to reveal my trump card?

140
00:11:06,529 --> 00:11:09,839
Hold on. I never met him after I married you.

141
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:10,940
I dare you to keep talking.

142
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:23,050
You won.

143
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:28,960
Okay. Fine. Let's get a divorce. I'll give you what you want.

144
00:11:29,359 --> 00:11:31,220
A divorce? Why? Who says I wanted a divorce?

145
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,170
Choose.

146
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:45,309
Do you want me to disclose this to the entire world and divorce me?

147
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:46,310
Or...

148
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,180
will you listen to me and cooperate?

149
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:53,309
What are you talking about?

150
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:54,870
You said I was a flaw in your campaign.

151
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,920
Isn't that why you wanted to divorce me?

152
00:11:56,979 --> 00:12:00,149
Right. I did want that. But I changed my mind.

153
00:12:02,359 --> 00:12:04,879
I'm thinking about giving you a chance to make up for the loss.

154
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,409
- Yes, Ms. Han. - What should I do?

155
00:12:26,249 --> 00:12:27,279
What's wrong?

156
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:31,749
My husband has the footage from the spy camera.

157
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:36,258
Let's talk in person. Should I go to you?

158
00:12:36,259 --> 00:12:38,389
No. I can't talk now.

159
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,229
I need to go.

160
00:12:51,269 --> 00:12:53,189
Didn't you say you got rid of the original file?

161
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:55,310
Yes. What's wrong?

162
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:58,350
Noh Yul Seong got his hands on the video.

163
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,720
Who are you calling?

164
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,290
That jerk.

165
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:10,989
The number you dialed does not exist.

166
00:13:11,359 --> 00:13:12,759
Please check...

167
00:13:15,999 --> 00:13:17,029
I'm sorry.

168
00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:23,899
(Number 2, Noh Yul Seong)

169
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:27,069
Each party has begun the race to select their nominee.

170
00:13:27,070 --> 00:13:29,878
But Hanjoo Party announced that they would select...

171
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:31,909
their nominee solely based on the opinion poll.

172
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,720
Let's see.

173
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:37,649
All right.

174
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:42,259
Do you know the best way to win over...

175
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,190
the public sentiment?

176
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:46,359
It's getting their sympathy.

177
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:49,259
Who's going to sympathize with someone like you?

178
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:53,930
You must be really grateful...

179
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:57,999
that you became useful in achieving just that.

180
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:02,239
It's all thanks to the new rule they implemented for the election.

181
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:06,109
Keep your promise that you will get my father out on bail.

182
00:14:08,249 --> 00:14:09,779
It depends on how well you do.

183
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,389
Let's go now.

184
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,398
We demand Noh Yul Seong to withdraw.

185
00:14:25,399 --> 00:14:27,398
- Withdraw! - Withdraw!

186
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:30,469
His father-in-law is a criminal. How dare he run for office?

187
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,408
- How dare he? - How dare he?

188
00:14:32,409 --> 00:14:35,238
Noh Yul Seong is trying to deceive the people. He must withdraw!

189
00:14:35,239 --> 00:14:37,008
- Withdraw! - Withdraw!

190
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:40,209
Admit his father-in-law is guilty, and step down with integrity!

191
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:41,920
- Step down! - Step down!

192
00:14:42,019 --> 00:14:44,018
We demand Noh Yul Seong to withdraw.

193
00:14:44,019 --> 00:14:45,539
(We demand Noh Yul Seong to withdraw.)

194
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,489
(Noh Yul Seong, out!)

195
00:15:05,369 --> 00:15:07,268
- Comment on their public opinion. - Withdraw!

196
00:15:07,269 --> 00:15:08,878
- Withdraw! - Withdraw!

197
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:11,340
His father-in-law is a criminal. How dare he run for office?

198
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:18,080
- Are you all right? - Get him!

199
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:19,290
Are you okay?

200
00:15:20,149 --> 00:15:21,149
(Number 2, Noh Yul Seong)

201
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,488
Are you all right?

202
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:25,358
- He's bleeding. - Are you okay?

203
00:15:25,359 --> 00:15:27,690
- Oh, no. - He's hurt pretty badly.

204
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:31,259
- Are you all right? - Oh, no!

205
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:35,739
How's my wife? Can you keep her safe?

206
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:36,970
Are you all right?

207
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:45,450
- Are you okay? - Are you okay?

208
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:47,450
He's bleeding.

209
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,949
Candidate Noh Yul Seong of Hanjoo Party received stitches...

210
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:52,018
for a stab wound inflicted by an attacker when he tried...

211
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:54,019
to stop the assailant from harming his wife today.

212
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,220
What's Ms. Han doing with him?

213
00:15:58,119 --> 00:16:00,479
I heard he was going into politics. He's putting on a show.

214
00:16:00,889 --> 00:16:02,960
That explains why they changed the election rule.

215
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:11,139
Ms. Han. Please pick up your phone.

216
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,950
Find out where Noh Yul Seong got treated, and text it to me.

217
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:20,550
Okay.

218
00:16:33,889 --> 00:16:35,359
Let me explain.

219
00:16:36,859 --> 00:16:38,529
Some people told me...

220
00:16:40,729 --> 00:16:42,470
to leave my wife.

221
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:48,580
How could I abandon my wife...

222
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:51,878
because of her father's flaw?

223
00:16:51,879 --> 00:16:53,680
That's just ridiculous.

224
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,550
I will protect my wife to the end.

225
00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:03,259
And as for the recent incident,

226
00:17:05,590 --> 00:17:08,629
I believe those who incited these assailants,

227
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,158
clinging to outdated principles...

228
00:17:11,159 --> 00:17:12,829
such as guilt-by-association, should be held responsible.

229
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:13,868
Who are those people?

230
00:17:13,869 --> 00:17:15,599
Are you implying your opponent's staff?

231
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,800
Candidate Noh.

232
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:34,449
Can you stay out of our marriage? Please?

233
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,389
Get lost.

234
00:17:37,859 --> 00:17:39,260
Shut your mouth...

235
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:41,490
before I reveal the truth to the reporters.

236
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:46,300
Well, I'll have to disclose her video too then.

237
00:17:47,629 --> 00:17:48,669
I'm sorry.

238
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:52,240
I want to stop.

239
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:55,010
Don't worry. He can't disclose that video.

240
00:17:55,510 --> 00:17:56,670
He'll be arrested right away.

241
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:59,179
Why would I leak the video myself?

242
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:02,419
I don't want you to pursue my case anymore.

243
00:18:03,879 --> 00:18:04,949
Ms. Han.

244
00:18:05,889 --> 00:18:07,589
How are you going to keep living like this?

245
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:08,959
I'm sorry. Could you just...

246
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,359
leave?

247
00:18:25,409 --> 00:18:26,909
I think you just got fired.

248
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,350
Get out.

249
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,749
When people are given choices,

250
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:08,379
they're bound to choose the path they can endure.

251
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,178
To her, being with him must have been...

252
00:19:11,179 --> 00:19:12,990
the path she could endure.

253
00:19:13,389 --> 00:19:15,229
In my opinion, we should respect her decision.

254
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:20,859
Do you want to drink?

255
00:19:22,399 --> 00:19:23,830
I'm kind of tired today.

256
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:29,570
Okay.

257
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,379
Hasn't she learned anything from you?

258
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:43,020
How could she go back to him after seeing what he did to you?

259
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:46,850
It just shows how hard it is to go through a divorce.

260
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:52,329
Lawyer Dong said Ms. Han...

261
00:19:52,330 --> 00:19:54,760
chose the path she could handle.

262
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:57,659
This is a good sign.

263
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,110
What are you talking about?

264
00:20:01,969 --> 00:20:04,240
You started to develop feelings for him.

265
00:20:04,669 --> 00:20:07,070
You mentioned him out of the blue.

266
00:20:08,609 --> 00:20:11,080
Gosh. It's not that.

267
00:20:11,439 --> 00:20:12,908
Try to make it work this time.

268
00:20:12,909 --> 00:20:14,909
It took so many years for you guys to be together.

269
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,060
(Seo Yun's Nanny, Ms. Lee)

270
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:25,189
Wait.

271
00:20:26,689 --> 00:20:27,689
Yes, Ms. Lee.

272
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:30,659
It's been a while since Ms. Han told me about your request.

273
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,129
I'm finally giving you a call.

274
00:20:32,669 --> 00:20:34,070
Have you given it some thought?

275
00:20:34,699 --> 00:20:36,739
I will match any conditions you demand...

276
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:37,769
I'm sorry.

277
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:39,239
I've thought about this,

278
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,016
but I can't let you talk to Seo Yun on the phone.

279
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,310
Ms. Lee.

280
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:45,649
If the chairwoman were to find out, I would lose my job.

281
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:48,820
But I'll send you pictures every month.

282
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,820
Okay.

283
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:55,020
Then send me his pictures. Please do that for me.

284
00:21:00,429 --> 00:21:02,359
Is that Ms. Lee? Seo Yun's nanny?

(Seo Yun's Nanny, Ms. Lee)

286
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:12,609
It's Seo Yun.

287
00:21:14,709 --> 00:21:16,040
Gosh. Is that Seo Yun?

288
00:21:19,810 --> 00:21:21,679
He grew a lot while I was away.

289
00:21:23,050 --> 00:21:26,520
Gosh. The older he gets, the more his eyes resemble yours.

290
00:21:32,389 --> 00:21:33,459
I...

291
00:21:35,699 --> 00:21:37,330
will bring back my Seo Yun.

292
00:21:38,429 --> 00:21:39,669
I will be the one to raise him.

293
00:21:40,929 --> 00:21:42,240
Of course, you will!

my loss.

302
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:33,519
There are claims that you have incited Noh Yul Seong's terrorist.

303
00:22:33,649 --> 00:22:35,889
Why would I do that against an opposing candidate?

304
00:22:36,359 --> 00:22:38,188
That is just slander.

305
00:22:38,189 --> 00:22:39,469

We're really riding the wind.

The materials for Han Ji In.

318
00:23:34,379 --> 00:23:36,618
We can just follow the manual and shred them up, right?

319
00:23:36,619 --> 00:23:39,419
No. The solution isn't over.

320
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:41,790
Let's wait.

321
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,060
Until divorce can be bearable.

322
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:46,330
For how long?

323
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,859
The time will come.

324
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,600
Keep tracking the kidnappers.

325
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:54,220

326

331

getting in a group chat of tow truck drivers is the best shout.

00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,090
This was nothing.

364
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:40,499
I wonder if you're girlfriend knows you're like this.

365
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,600
I'm dying to tell her.

366
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:44,839
He got caught by me.

367
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,769
I thought she was a college student. She looks really young.

368
00:26:46,770 --> 00:26:48,869
Gosh. You're good.

369
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:53,550
Is she younger?

370
00:26:55,609 --> 00:26:56,619
She's not older than you?

371
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,649
What? Someone older?

372
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:05,929
The girlfriend with a baby face...

373
00:27:06,459 --> 00:27:08,659
It's been four days since we've become just friends.

374
00:27:10,199 --> 00:27:11,300
You got dumped already?

375
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:14,868
- I was the one to dump her. - Because you saw it coming.

376
00:27:14,869 --> 00:27:17,539
"Dump her before you get dumped." This is my motto.

377
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,708
- That's so pathetic. - Why is that pathetic?

378
00:27:19,709 --> 00:27:22,909
Hold on. Are you saying you're single right now?

379
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,280
Yes.

380
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:26,510
Why?

381
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,510
I'm not sure.

382
00:27:30,050 --> 00:27:31,879
- Is that so? - Yes.

383
00:27:33,590 --> 00:27:36,490
Gosh. Then let's make a toast.

384
00:27:36,689 --> 00:27:39,429
This is for the one who got dumped by Dae Gi.

385
00:27:39,889 --> 00:27:41,929
- Cheers. - Cheers.

386
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:53,709
Please give us some pure chicken feet.

387
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:58,679
Shall we drink some more?

388
00:27:59,350 --> 00:28:01,449
We'll get going now.

389
00:28:02,250 --> 00:28:03,519
Bye.

390
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,549
- Bye. - All right. Bye.

391
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,019
- Bye. - Bye.

392
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,250
- Dae Gi. - Yes?

393
00:28:09,159 --> 00:28:11,118
- Good luck! - Good luck!

394
00:28:11,119 --> 00:28:13,490
- I'm perfectly fine. - Right.

395
00:28:15,859 --> 00:28:18,359
Goodness. Those are the good times.

396
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:23,369
The air feels great.

397
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,339
It's stuffy.

398
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:29,340
The weather is amazing too. My goodness.

399
00:28:29,439 --> 00:28:31,108

401
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:36,320
Besides having headaches thanks to our clients,

402
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,949
life is great fun.

403
00:28:41,590 --> 00:28:42,619
Well,

404
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:46,590
I can't even remember the last time I had fun.

405
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:50,359
Have you ever been...

406
00:28:51,459 --> 00:28:52,928
in a one-man band before?

407
00:28:52,929 --> 00:28:56,198
Playing all the instruments on your own.

408
00:28:56,199 --> 00:28:58,869
- Gosh, that's just... - Are you drunk?

409
00:28:59,409 --> 00:29:02,108
I thought you were a better drinker when you were younger.

410
00:29:02,109 --> 00:29:03,908
I've still got it.

411
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:05,739
I'm full of energy.

412
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,509
- Full of energy, my foot. - Aren't I right?

- Gosh. - What did you just say?

417
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:31,639
Oh, come on.

418
00:29:33,469 --> 00:29:35,138
Sir, we were just drinking together.

419
00:29:35,139 --> 00:29:36,908
- We weren't doing anything. - We feel wronged.

420
00:29:36,909 --> 00:29:38,638
We're lovers.

421
00:29:38,639 --> 00:29:40,079
This isn't prostitution!

422
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,249
Keep a straight face.

423
00:29:41,250 --> 00:29:43,080
- Right. - Oh, hey.

424
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:46,218
Head over to the farthest room. You'll find a similar guy.

426
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:52,459
Follow me.

427

This way.

428
00:30:02,899 --> 00:30:03,999
Did you find him?

429
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,109
You can see him, right? This is him, right?

430
00:30:06,369 --> 00:30:07,369
It's him.

431
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:09,939
The jerk who tore up my shirt.

432
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:11,939
Confirmed.

433
00:30:16,879 --> 00:30:18,379
It was Noh Yul Seong, wasn't it?

434
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:22,349
- What? - The kidnapping of CEO Noh's wife.

435
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:24,119
Let's be honest and get out of here.

436
00:30:24,590 --> 00:30:27,359
Prostitution is just embarrassing!

437
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:30,730
Are you from the police?

438
00:30:31,429 --> 00:30:32,529
Come out in order.

439
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:34,229
I'll make sure to have the police...

440
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:36,698
to deal with your phone with extra care.

441
00:30:36,699 --> 00:30:37,740
Give it back.

442
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:39,868
Gosh.

443
00:30:39,869 --> 00:30:42,070
Sure. You can be the one to give it to them.

444
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,709

445
00:30:49,179 --> 00:30:50,580

I'll get back to you.

448
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:02,628
He was sent to the prosecution, but he's denying it.

449
00:31:02,629 --> 00:31:04,829
He's saying he did the kidnapping on his own for money.

450
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:06,599
Is he from the Suicide Squad?

451
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,600
Even so, Pandora's Box has been opened.

Everything says it's him.

462
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,500
But he'll find a way out.

463
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,730
The evidence isn't clear enough.

464
00:31:45,469 --> 00:31:47,168
If Candidate Noh gets elected,

465
00:31:47,169 --> 00:31:49,678
the Han Joo Hyuk case will come to nothing.

466
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:50,708
(Hanjoo Party Seoha-gu National Assembly Election Debate)

467
00:31:50,709 --> 00:31:53,810
I'm pretty sure he'll get released by the power of his son-in-law.

468
00:31:54,350 --> 00:31:58,280
Candidate Jung, I will make a promise right here.

469
00:31:59,219 --> 00:32:01,389
Until the final decision of my father-in-law's case,

470
00:32:02,119 --> 00:32:04,659
I will not submit a bail application.

471
00:32:05,459 --> 00:32:08,030
And if the result of this trial...

472
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,300
goes beyond common sense,

473
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:13,199
I will stop any form of bail.

474
00:32:14,869 --> 00:32:15,969
Law...

475
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:19,239
must be equal to all people.

476
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,340
That's my belief as a man who knows the law.

477
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:23,408
All right. That was Candidate Jung's...

478
00:32:23,409 --> 00:32:25,329
Has the bail application not been submitted yet?

479
00:32:26,909 --> 00:32:28,280
I'm not sure.

480
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:32,990
So he hasn't submitted it. I've just been used.

481
00:32:48,469 --> 00:32:49,469
She left.

482
00:32:51,139 --> 00:32:52,139
Is it over?

483
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:56,679
CEO Noh made a nationwide promise.

484
00:32:56,879 --> 00:32:58,999
He said he'd stop his father-in-law from bailing out.

485
00:32:59,139 --> 00:33:00,209
How does Ms. Han look?

486
00:33:00,649 --> 00:33:01,849
She just left.

487
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:03,980
You can just read it from her face. "Very angry."

488
00:33:05,219 --> 00:33:06,448
Great work. Come back to the office.

489
00:33:06,449 --> 00:33:07,520
- Okay. - Okay.

490
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:12,459
It will sting if you get hit on the back of your head.

491
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:17,500
Won't this be enough for her to feel that divorce is bearable?

492
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:22,129
You're right. He just said he'd stop her father from bailing out.

493
00:33:23,399 --> 00:33:24,540
Shall we begin, then?

494
00:33:26,139 --> 00:33:27,439
The solution for this...

What's the most important thing?

514
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:36,068
It's preparing the related bills, right?

515
00:34:36,069 --> 00:34:37,079
- Yes! - Yes!

516
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:39,508
As a former lawyer, I will make sure to...

517
00:34:39,509 --> 00:34:41,480
I know Noh Yul Seong very well!

519
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:46,589
Who is she?

520
00:34:46,949 --> 00:34:47,949
What?

521
00:34:48,049 --> 00:34:49,350
What are you doing? Stop her.

522
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:53,489

523
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:56,258
- Gosh! - All right!

00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:46,908
I know Noh Yul Seong very well!

541
00:35:46,909 --> 00:35:49,779
I'm his former wife!

542
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,949
I know all of his shameless...

543
00:35:55,719 --> 00:35:57,619
Where's Kim Sa Ra?

544
00:36:14,069 --> 00:36:15,909
Are you messing with me?

545
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:21,080
Elections are right around the corner. What have you done?

546
00:36:22,549 --> 00:36:23,549
Sue me.

547
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:27,650
Sue me for defamation based on false information.

548
00:36:29,089 --> 00:36:30,190
That was what that was for.

549
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:34,230
What?

550
00:36:44,739 --> 00:36:45,739
What are you saying?

551
00:36:46,299 --> 00:36:48,610
You have to sue me for the court to decide what's true.

552
00:36:49,069 --> 00:36:52,380
To know if you really tried to kidnap your current wife...

553
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:54,580
but ended up kidnapping your former wife.

554
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,020
I will...

555
00:37:00,549 --> 00:37:02,819
do an interview tomorrow.

556
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:05,159
If anyone like a journalist...

557
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,460
asks you anything,

558
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,499
just admit that I was right.

559
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,529
Why should I?

560
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:15,230
Do you think that the world revolves...

561
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:16,570
just around you, Noh Yul Seong?

562
00:37:16,869 --> 00:37:17,940
If you do that for me,

563
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,739
then I will update you on Seo Yun...

564
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:23,679
once a month. How does that sound?

565
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,119
Excuse me, Mr. Noh Yul Seong.

566
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:35,650
I make the offers.

567
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:38,619
"I, Noh Yul Seong,"

568
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,488
"admit the responsibility of the failure of marriage..."

569
00:37:41,489 --> 00:37:43,960
"and will pay Han Ji In an alimony of one million dollars."

570
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:45,400
Sign it right here.

571
00:37:46,569 --> 00:37:49,569
If you agree to do so, I will do that interview...

572
00:37:50,799 --> 00:37:51,799
that you want me to do.

573
00:37:59,339 --> 00:38:00,710
What are you doing?

574
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:04,949
Get out. Why are you causing trouble in someone else's office?

575
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:12,790
Gosh, Kim Sa Ra and Dong Gi Jun. You two really made it work.

576
00:38:14,429 --> 00:38:15,429
Forget it.

577
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,199
Make sure to say the right things to those journalists.

578
00:38:21,969 --> 00:38:24,169
Brace yourself if you fail to do so.

579
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:26,239
I won't care about you or Seo Yun anymore. Got it?

580
00:38:30,279 --> 00:38:31,279
Get out of my way.

581
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,140
Was he like that when you lived with him?

582
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,868
How dare he use violence?

583
00:38:55,869 --> 00:38:59,270
I was getting on his nerves on purpose to get him riled up.

584
00:39:01,610 --> 00:39:03,980
Well, it's D-Day tomorrow.

585
00:39:07,750 --> 00:39:10,070
I guess it's great that he's moving according to our plan.

586
00:39:33,469 --> 00:39:34,610
Thank you for coming.

587
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:37,239
Let's sit.

588
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:45,650
I wanted to see you before ending things.

589
00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:51,060
We got the kidnapper.

590
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:54,889
As expected, Noh Yul Seong...

591
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:56,580
was the one to instigate it.

592
00:40:02,429 --> 00:40:03,440
I...

593
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:06,239
will keep it in.

594
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:10,779
If I do so, it will be of help for my father.

595
00:40:11,739 --> 00:40:13,449
If you just keep it in like that,

596
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:17,059
that's all you'll do for the rest of your life.

597
00:40:20,489 --> 00:40:21,690
That person...

598
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:30,630
knows my weakness.

599
00:40:31,029 --> 00:40:34,028
When he's cornered, you never know what he'll do.

600
00:40:34,029 --> 00:40:35,389
You know he's that kind of person.

601
00:40:38,069 --> 00:40:39,100
I sure do.

602
00:40:40,969 --> 00:40:44,610
So there's only one way to win.

606

I've been harassed by my former wife. It's true.

607
00:41:17,139 --> 00:41:20,080
She is someone who was imprisoned...

608
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,409
for doing things behind my back.

609
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:25,880
After our divorce,

610
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:28,718
unfortunately, she has been continuing to slander me...

611
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:30,659
with false information.

612
00:41:31,159 --> 00:41:33,589
Was your current wife aware of this as well?

613
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:34,929
Yes, of course.

614
00:41:37,029 --> 00:41:38,029
Honey.

615
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:43,500
I just feel terribly sorry for my wife...

616
00:41:44,139 --> 00:41:46,139
who quietly stood by my side through all this.

617
00:41:46,339 --> 00:41:48,040
Please say a word.

618
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:52,879
It'll be over if you say you understand what had happened.

619
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,150

(A new future with the power of law and principles, Noh Yul Seong)

Hello. I'm Han Ji In.

622
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:07,759
The things my husband's former wife said yesterday.

623
00:42:09,029 --> 00:42:10,159
So...

624
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:14,830
her claim that Candidate Noh tried to kidnap me...

625
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:17,000
but ended up kidnapping his former wife...

626
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:21,810
is all true.

627
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:24,610
- What? - What?

628
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:30,150
Is there any evidence that it was Candidate Noh?

629
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:32,150
It's all in this phone.

630
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:34,649
The kidnapper got orders from Chayul Law Firm.

631
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:36,889
- How did you get that? - What?

632
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:40,169
I never said it was the kidnapper's phone.

633
00:42:40,230 --> 00:42:41,258
It's just the same model.

634
00:42:41,259 --> 00:42:42,730
Just a moment.

635
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,459
I will give a clear explanation about this...

636
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:46,845
But why didn't you report this to the police?

637
00:42:46,869 --> 00:42:47,929
Because I am...

638
00:42:49,929 --> 00:42:52,139
being threatened by my husband.

639
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:55,270
Let's take the initiative.

640
00:42:57,409 --> 00:43:00,310
Say you're being blackmailed by him with hidden camera footage.

641
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:01,948
You want me to say it?

642
00:43:01,949 --> 00:43:04,219
That's the only way to block Noh Yul Seong.

643
00:43:04,580 --> 00:43:07,260
We can also hold him accountable for the breakdown of the marriage.

644
00:43:10,389 --> 00:43:12,219
- No. - The contents of the blackmail...

645
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:13,789
are my secretly recorded...

00:43:15,790 --> 00:43:17,029
is true.

648
00:43:19,630 --> 00:43:22,929
Candidate Noh exploited his wife's weaknesses...

649
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,040
and made her help his election campaign.

00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:13,400
is not understandable.

721
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:33,520
Oh, hello.

722
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:35,819
Who are you?

723
00:47:37,259 --> 00:47:40,060
You are Na Yu Mi's grandfather, right?

724
00:47:41,589 --> 00:47:42,630
Yes.

725
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:46,400
Here.

726
00:47:51,739 --> 00:47:53,940
You kept all of her belongings.

727
00:47:54,339 --> 00:47:58,508
Was there really someone who said that Yu Mi...

728
00:47:58,509 --> 00:47:59,839
didn't commit suicide?

729
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:04,049
Yes, I'll call you once I find that person.

730
00:48:04,219 --> 00:48:05,250
Okay.

731
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:09,219
I'll check her belongings.

732
00:48:09,389 --> 00:48:10,389
Okay.

733
00:48:16,089 --> 00:48:17,630
(To Yu Mi)

734
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:30,009
Wait.

735
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:33,949
I thought her phone was lost.

736
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:36,448
I could only retrieve her call logs.

737
00:48:36,449 --> 00:48:39,350
Maybe it was her old phone. It was in her drawer.

738
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:46,059
If you're okay with it, can I bring the phone...

739
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:47,460
and look inside?

740
00:48:51,299 --> 00:48:52,698
I've unlocked it.

741
00:48:52,699 --> 00:48:54,199
- Already? - Yes.

742
00:48:55,029 --> 00:48:56,199
Dae Gi.

743
00:48:57,029 --> 00:48:59,199
- There's nothing you can't do. - Stop.

744
00:49:00,569 --> 00:49:01,639
Thanks.

(Photos)

748
00:49:15,489 --> 00:49:17,819
It was her second phone that she used with him.

749
00:49:18,219 --> 00:49:19,690
Who is she?

750
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,529
It's a case that I was investigating.

751
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:25,199
Let's not tell Ms. Kim for now.

752
00:49:27,199 --> 00:49:28,900
She might be bothered by it.

753
00:49:29,230 --> 00:49:30,230
Okay.

754
00:49:50,690 --> 00:49:54,659
Na Yu Mi, who's deceased, and Noh Yul Seong were having an affair.

755
00:49:54,830 --> 00:49:57,258
Noh Yul Seong took Professor Seo's phone...

756
00:49:57,259 --> 00:49:59,928
who had a last call with Na Yu Mi.

757
00:49:59,929 --> 00:50:02,399
(Na Yu Mi, Noh Yul Seong, Seo Woong Jin)

758
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,499
- For goodness' sake! - I said I didn't want it!

759
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,369
- Listen to me! - Jung Sang Joo!

760
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:07,868
- Jung Sang Joo! - Jung Sang Joo!

761
00:50:07,869 --> 00:50:09,469
I had trust.

762
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:11,839
Party members and comrades.

763
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:14,979
Your choice was right.

764
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:16,048
(Hanjoo Party's Jung Sang Joo is confirmed to go for by-election.)

765
00:50:16,049 --> 00:50:17,080
I, Jung Sang Joo,

766
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:19,619
will not disappoint you.

767
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:23,250
I'll do my best to win...

768
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,159
the by-election!

769
00:50:31,360 --> 00:50:34,329
- Jung Sang Joo! - Jung Sang Joo!

770
00:50:34,330 --> 00:50:35,499
- Jung Sang Joo! - Jung Sang Joo!

771
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:37,020
- Is he coming out? - He's coming out!

772
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:41,869
Did you predict that you'd lose?

773
00:50:42,009 --> 00:50:43,769
Do you think your ex-wife and your current wife's teamwork...

774
00:50:43,770 --> 00:50:45,339
affected the result?

775
00:50:49,179 --> 00:50:52,080
Did you go through your second divorce after that incident?

776
00:50:56,850 --> 00:50:59,790
Reporters, thanks for your efforts.

777
00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:02,488
It's not even a difficult question.

778
00:51:02,489 --> 00:51:04,798
- Please comment. - Please say something about it.

779
00:51:04,799 --> 00:51:06,960
- Please comment. - Please say something about it.

780
00:51:23,779 --> 00:51:26,219
They only ask about your present and past wife until the end.

781
00:51:26,279 --> 00:51:28,519
Those questions aren't for you who lost in the election.

782
00:51:32,889 --> 00:51:34,830
Let's postpone our dinner.

783
00:51:35,690 --> 00:51:38,600
They ruined our plan.

784
00:51:38,799 --> 00:51:40,199
I can never forgive them.

785
00:51:47,969 --> 00:51:49,069
Me neither.

786
00:52:03,319 --> 00:52:06,460
I hesitated too much.

787
00:52:09,489 --> 00:52:12,060
No worries. I was like that too.

788
00:52:13,699 --> 00:52:15,969
Even if you break up with someone you dislike,

789
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:17,540
divorce is difficult.

790
00:52:18,869 --> 00:52:19,969
Thank you.

791
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:27,210
Because of the reporters, he would want to end this quickly.

792
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:30,409
Regardless of the amount, we will receive alimony and settle.

793
00:52:37,619 --> 00:52:38,659
(Husband)

794
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:44,360
- What? - Let's meet today.

795
00:52:45,299 --> 00:52:46,560
The court.

796
00:52:47,060 --> 00:52:48,199
See you at the court.

797
00:52:48,369 --> 00:52:49,569
I'm going to file for divorce.

798
00:52:53,069 --> 00:52:55,269
You know where Chayul Town is going to be built, right?

799
00:52:55,509 --> 00:52:56,569
Come here.

800
00:52:57,339 --> 00:52:58,638
Why would I?

801
00:52:58,639 --> 00:53:00,338
You aren't coming home.

802
00:53:00,339 --> 00:53:03,009
Do you want to meet me at my office where thousands of people are?

803
00:53:08,089 --> 00:53:10,218
I know that place well too.

804
00:53:10,219 --> 00:53:11,389
Shall we meet there?

805
00:53:11,619 --> 00:53:14,630
Let me talk to Han Ji In. I'm not talking to you.

806
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:17,600
Aren't you...

807
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:20,670
trying to negotiate the divorce settlement?

808
00:53:22,330 --> 00:53:24,040
Or we can meet you at the court!

809
00:53:31,810 --> 00:53:34,279
This area will be demolished, starting next week.

810
00:53:34,679 --> 00:53:37,109
The law school will be built here.

811
00:53:37,110 --> 00:53:38,150
At S1.

812
00:53:41,819 --> 00:53:42,989
It's raining.

813
00:53:44,089 --> 00:53:45,920
Why the heck is it raining?

814
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:47,529
I'm sorry.

815
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:50,560
The rain...

816
00:53:58,170 --> 00:53:59,338
I'm almost there.

817
00:53:59,339 --> 00:54:02,540
I think I'll be about ten minutes late because of the traffic.

818
00:54:02,909 --> 00:54:04,189
Please wait for me at the front.

819
00:54:04,509 --> 00:54:05,908
I'll meet him first.

820
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:08,309
No, wait. I don't feel it's right for you to meet him alone.

821
00:54:08,909 --> 00:54:12,279
I'm his son's mother. Don't worry.

822
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:28,369
Since it's raining,

823
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,040
he's waiting inside.

824
00:54:41,610 --> 00:54:44,619
(We strongly oppose redevelopment!)

825
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:46,480
(No entry)

826
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,290
(We strongly oppose redevelopment!)

827
00:55:47,279 --> 00:55:50,179
I didn't know I'd meet you here.

828
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:53,749
I thought you'd build...

829
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:55,989
Chayul Town here right after divorcing me.

830
00:55:57,489 --> 00:55:58,489
But I guess I was wrong.

831
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:00,560
I'll give you 500,000 dollars.

832
00:56:01,630 --> 00:56:05,400
But drop the lawsuit and agree to the divorce settlement.

833
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:08,928
Can I consider that as the alimony?

834
00:56:08,929 --> 00:56:10,230
I'll give you 500,000 dollars,

835
00:56:11,170 --> 00:56:12,540
so we can sign a contract.

836
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:15,080
Han Ji In isn't getting it as the alimony.

837
00:56:16,909 --> 00:56:21,149
I guess this was why Hong Gil Dong felt it was unfair.

838
00:56:21,150 --> 00:56:23,710
She can't call her alimony as alimony.

839
00:56:25,049 --> 00:56:27,179
If you're a representative, you should negotiate...

840
00:56:27,549 --> 00:56:29,290
as a representative. Don't be obstinate.

841
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:34,989
Do you know what people said when I divorced without alimony?

842
00:56:35,690 --> 00:56:37,699
"What did she do wrong that she..."

843
00:56:37,799 --> 00:56:41,130
"couldn't even get a single penny from Chayul and get kicked out?"

844
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:49,409
I can't let Ms. Han go through the same thing.

845
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:54,009
I say 700,000 dollars. Admit that this is for alimony.

846
00:56:55,210 --> 00:56:56,610
It'll be 900,000 dollars next time.

847
00:57:07,089 --> 00:57:09,159
- Seo Yun, it's Daddy. - Dad!

848
00:57:09,659 --> 00:57:10,999
- Don't you miss me? - Seo Yun!

849
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,000
- I miss you. - Seo Yun.

850
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:15,069
- I'll call you back. Okay? - Let me talk to him!

851
00:57:15,170 --> 00:57:17,968
- You're crazy. - Hey, are you crazy?

852
00:57:17,969 --> 00:57:20,369
Do you want to talk to your son?

853
00:57:21,139 --> 00:57:22,210
Agree to my terms, then.

854
00:57:22,909 --> 00:57:25,539
Are you using our child? You despicable jerk!

855
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:28,710
I said I'd let you live comfortably.

856
00:57:29,210 --> 00:57:31,919
I told you I'd let you be my first!

857
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:33,949
Why would I receive your money?

858
00:57:34,389 --> 00:57:37,219
I don't deal with rotten people.

859
00:57:37,589 --> 00:57:38,888
I'll take everything away from you!

860
00:57:38,889 --> 00:57:40,420
Try to take it away. Try.

861
00:57:43,429 --> 00:57:44,900
Hey. Take it away.

862
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:46,658
- Mr. Noh! - Try taking it.

863
00:57:46,659 --> 00:57:48,068
Try to take it away. Say something.

864
00:57:48,069 --> 00:57:50,630
- Calm down. Don't do this. - Try to take it away! Take it!

865
00:57:58,779 --> 00:58:01,210
You'll never see Seo Yun again.

866
00:58:14,259 --> 00:58:17,529
(We strongly oppose redevelopment!)

867
00:58:19,630 --> 00:58:22,391
Stuck there, she needs to urinate and defecate to come to her senses.

868
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:35,980
Noh Yul Seong! Open the door!

869
00:59:05,980 --> 00:59:07,750
Oh, my goodness! Oh, no!

870
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:01,330
(No entry)

871
01:00:09,509 --> 01:00:10,509
(Kim Sa Ra)

872
01:00:17,509 --> 01:00:18,520
(Emergency)

873
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:20,880
Yes, hello?

874
01:00:20,881 --> 01:00:23,888
There's a fire at Seoha-gu within the redevelopment area 1 and 2.

875
01:00:23,889 --> 01:00:24,920
Please come quick.

876
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:28,720
(We oppose to redevelopment.)

877
01:00:45,980 --> 01:00:46,980
(Descending lifeline)

878
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:50,250
(Descending lifeline)

879
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:26,880
Kim Sa Ra! Are you in there?

880
01:02:09,089 --> 01:02:10,130
Kim Sa Ra!

881
01:02:11,330 --> 01:02:12,400
Kim Sa Ra!

882
01:02:26,839 --> 01:02:29,179
Kim Sa Ra!

883
01:02:54,369 --> 01:02:56,409
(Queen of Divorce)

884
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:26,568
Hi. Lawyer Dong.

885
01:03:26,569 --> 01:03:27,798
Do you know each other?

886
01:03:27,799 --> 01:03:29,810
We used to date.

887
01:03:30,409 --> 01:03:32,408
Don't care so much about us.

888
01:03:32,409 --> 01:03:33,409
I don't!

889
01:03:33,739 --> 01:03:35,810
Shall we be together today?

890
01:03:35,949 --> 01:03:37,350
Choi La Hee, you're still the same.

891
01:03:37,549 --> 01:03:39,389
Your ability to make it impossible to control.

892
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:41,618
We can't just leave Noh Yul Seong alone.

893
01:03:41,619 --> 01:03:43,290
What will you do if he does that again?

894
01:03:43,619 --> 01:03:45,360
You can come to save me again.

895
01:03:46,420 --> 01:03:48,428
She doesn't say what's wrong.

896
01:03:48,429 --> 01:03:49,960
Oh, it's Lawyer Dong.

897
01:03:51,429 --> 01:03:52,759
Why are you here?

898
01:03:52,929 --> 01:03:56,229
