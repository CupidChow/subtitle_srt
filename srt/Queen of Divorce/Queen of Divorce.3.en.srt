(Queen of Divorce)

5
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,279
No way. Is this what I think it is?

6
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,450
Yes. That's it. He was the one behind it.

7
00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:51,449
So he had the highest marks from the training institute?

8
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:53,388
He did. Not only does he have an impressive resume,

9
00:00:53,389 --> 00:00:54,620
but he is also impressively bold.

10
00:01:04,329 --> 00:01:05,329
Hey.

11
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,739
Hey. Prosecutor Dong.

12
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,470
Look who it is. It's a loach.

13
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,009
You managed to weasel your way out of the recent case.

14
00:01:13,069 --> 00:01:14,139
Gosh.

15
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:15,779
By the way, I don't think...

16
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,350
this can be your designated parking spot.

17
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:21,879
Look at you, acting bossy. No wonder why the other prosecutors...

18
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,080
kicked you out. Seriously.

19
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,160
I heard you were moving far away.

20
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:31,860
Put it toward your gas.

21
00:01:51,649 --> 00:01:52,780
Gosh.

22
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,380
Oh, my.

23
00:01:59,149 --> 00:02:01,489
You know what? He sure knows when to go all out...

24
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:02,758
even if he has to pay a fine.

25
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:05,330
He did this when he knew he would end up paying a 5,000-dollar fine.

26
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:07,999
- Gosh. This is crazy. - Right?

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
If I were a woman, I would have asked for his number.

28
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,470
Gosh. They're made for each other.

29
00:02:15,799 --> 00:02:17,739
- With me? - No way!

30
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:25,250
(Episode 3)

31
00:02:41,699 --> 00:02:43,729
Gosh, don't worry about me.

32
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,470
The rest of the team welcomed me with open arms.

33
00:02:46,569 --> 00:02:50,139
So I'll be able to handle your cold treatment toward me.

34
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:52,340
You could have gotten a better job.

35
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:01,048
Well, are you under the impression that I chose to work here...

36
00:03:01,049 --> 00:03:02,380
for you?

37
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,079
Please don't get the wrong idea.

38
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:08,919
Given our history, we shouldn't be colleagues.

39
00:03:11,489 --> 00:03:14,430
Are you still hung up on me?

40
00:03:20,169 --> 00:03:21,840
If not, why do you care?

41
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:24,870
I'll give it three months.

42
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:27,239
If I still make you feel uncomfortable by then,

43
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,609
I'll leave.

44
00:03:33,009 --> 00:03:34,049
Three months.

45
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,519
Okay. That's a deal.

46
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:39,649
You did bring way too much stuff...

47
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:41,419
given you'll be here only for three months.

48
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,630
Right.

49
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,900
You still haven't shaken my hand yet.

50
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,180
Sure. Welcome.

51
00:04:05,509 --> 00:04:06,850
It's our first time working together.

52
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,650
I look forward to working with you.

53
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,109
- Ms. Kim. - What is it?

54
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,179
I was looking into Mr. Dong.

55
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,020
I think your friend posted this a long time ago.

56
00:04:50,059 --> 00:04:51,260
Did other people see this?

57
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:53,090
Do you want me to get rid of this?

58
00:04:54,229 --> 00:04:57,259
Gosh. What am I going to do with this?

59
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,330
Isn't it simple?

60
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,169
I have never seen this picture before.

61
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,100
Thank you.

62
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:04,640
- Could you get rid of it quickly? - Sure.

63
00:05:05,309 --> 00:05:07,239
Why am I here? Gosh. I can't remember a thing.

64
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:40,239
I look forward to working with you.

65
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,710
What was that?

66
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:57,660
Hey.

67
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,989
All right, Mr. Dong. Here's the Welcome Quiz.

68
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,530
Guess his nickname. It ends with D.

69
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,069
- Legend. - Hey.

70
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:07,628
- No. - David.

71
00:06:07,629 --> 00:06:09,600
- David. - Wrong.

72
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,099
Head. Card. Fund.

73
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,039
Keyboard. Code. Cloud. They are all wrong.

74
00:06:14,439 --> 00:06:15,779
- Any guess, Ms. Kim? - Shepherd.

75
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,049
- What? - How did you know?

76
00:06:18,679 --> 00:06:21,878
You know, look at his face.

77
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:23,879
He sort of resembles a dog. Don't you see the resemblance?

78
00:06:24,619 --> 00:06:26,489
- Pardon? - A dog?

79
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,918
I see. He's like a dog.

80
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:30,558
He doesn't let go once he gets his teeth into something.

81
00:06:30,559 --> 00:06:32,429
We welcome you and your tenacity, Mr. Dong. Clap, everyone.

82
00:06:34,289 --> 00:06:35,330
Okay.

83
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:39,228
Gosh. Did you already finish going through that?

84
00:06:39,229 --> 00:06:41,399
Well, yes.

85
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,470
Gosh.

86
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:44,639
By the way, is it allowed...

87
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,569
for a wife to file a divorce lawsuit just because her husband was...

88
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:48,340
in a sexual assault scandal?

89
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,410
Well, is there a law that says she can't?

90
00:06:52,049 --> 00:06:54,580
If the husband were to win the trial,

91
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,679
getting a divorce will be difficult.

92
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:05,789
Our client, Ms. Lee Joo Won, is serious about getting a divorce.

93
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:07,789
That's all we need to move forward.

94
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,729
How can you help her get a divorce just because she's serious about it?

95
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:13,629
We can.

96
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,840
Who gets to judge if she's serious about it...

97
00:07:16,939 --> 00:07:18,970
- or not? - We do.

98
00:07:19,809 --> 00:07:20,869
What?

99
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:23,678
- All right. Let's begin. - Yes, ma'am.

100
00:07:23,679 --> 00:07:25,779
Hold on.

101
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:28,049
You should at least tell me how you're going to...

102
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:29,679
judge that.

103
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:31,889
Well, let me brief you on how we do things...

104
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:32,919
The first step is...

105
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,090
studying the client.

106
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,460
I feel naked.

107
00:07:38,429 --> 00:07:40,688
Right in the middle of an intersection.

108
00:07:40,689 --> 00:07:43,628
I can't make my daughter suffer through this any longer.

109
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:47,329
Next, we learn about the spouse we have to bring down.

110
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:48,340
(JBC entry log)

111
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:50,839
Once we finish studying both spouses,

112
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,438
we find clues,

113
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:54,570
proving the other spouse as the guilty party.

114
00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:56,809
We do it very efficiently.

115
00:08:02,419 --> 00:08:03,450
Hello.

116
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:09,020
You're showing up now after ghosting me a year ago?

117
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,829
- And what? - Come on, sweetie. Help me out.

118
00:08:11,830 --> 00:08:13,760
I heard that you led the investigative coverage.

119
00:08:14,729 --> 00:08:15,760
Gosh.

120
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,439
You're getting married?

121
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,470
How could you do that to me?

122
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,879
- What? - Hey.

123
00:08:29,739 --> 00:08:31,038
- Have you gone mad? - Please I'm begging you.

124
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,350
Help me out just this once.

125
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:35,850
I knew it.

126
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,820
(Investigation on Jang Jae Gook's Sexual Assault Scandal)

127
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,619
(Kim Ji Eu, 25 years old, refused to be interviewed)

128
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,689
Dae Gi. From whom did you get this kind of inside information?

129
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:49,329
- From his ex or the one before her. - The one before her?

130
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:51,600
This time, it was from my ex from two relationships ago.

131
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:53,569
From two relationships ago?

132
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,039
My motto is give and take.

133
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,369
Well, I loved all of my exes.

134
00:08:57,570 --> 00:08:59,509
But this guy is something else. Gosh.

135
00:08:59,909 --> 00:09:02,540
Example One. He sent pictures every night.

136
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,079
Example Two.

137
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,210
He text-bombed this girl to ride a bicycle every weekend.

138
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:07,878
Example Three.

139
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:09,878
He asked to meet a girl alone at the cafe in front of the office.

140
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:11,118
Examples 4 and 5...

141
00:09:11,119 --> 00:09:12,148
(He verbally abused her.)

142
00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:13,549
This is the feedback of the anonymous survey...

143
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,959
JBC conducted with female freelancers.

144
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,789
It's a never-ending list of his improper behaviors.

145
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,559
Wait. Did Ms. Lee know about this?

146
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,600
No.

147
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:24,829
Then to use that as grounds to demand a divorce...

148
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,470
Of course, it's not enough.

149
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,070
Let's put eyes on him.

150
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:30,699
To win this case, we must find evidence...

151
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,138
that he's not just regular trash,

152
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:33,570
but trash that cannot even be recycled.

153
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:35,239
- Got it? - Yes, ma'am.

154
00:09:36,009 --> 00:09:37,179
What's going on?

155
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:39,409
Hold on a second.

156
00:09:40,409 --> 00:09:42,179
Wait. We're going to find his faults?

157
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,320
Hey.

Hey, you're here.

161
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,029
Gosh. You turned down a lot of nice offers. Why...

162
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,398
I don't understand your decision unless a girl you fell in love...

163
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,539

164
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,669
You're the only one I fell in love at first sight.

165
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:07,108
- I'll get going. - Okay.

166

Have you heard anything about his divorce?

170
00:10:15,619 --> 00:10:16,619
Why do you ask?

171
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,879
Does his divorce have to do with this case?

172
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:23,519
Can you cast a net for me?

173
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:26,560

What are you talking about? She can't represent clients.

184
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,269
She has a separate legal advisor.

His name is Dong Gi Jun.

Yes. That's right.

Okay. Bring your A game and handle the case.

The former anchor, Jang Jae Gook,

230
00:16:07,970 --> 00:16:10,169
was assaulted in his private office in the afternoon yesterday.

231
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:13,040
He was found unconscious and transported to the hospital.

232
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:16,478
Some witnesses said they saw his wife at the scene.

233
00:16:16,479 --> 00:16:18,778
But there's no record of his wife making a report to the police.

234
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:21,179

00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:34,259
There won't be any divorce if Ms. Lee doesn't have an alibi.

241
00:16:47,109 --> 00:16:49,040
You're telling me the truth, correct?

242
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:50,310
Yes.

243
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:51,909

252
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,369
No.

Then why did people see you there?

254

Did you go to the hospital to see your husband?

255

He's still unconscious. I'll visit him after this meeting.

I'm saying other people will.

261

Especially when they find out you're preparing to divorce him.

262
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:52,409

00:24:40,879 --> 00:24:42,108
(Kim Sa Ra)

364
00:24:42,109 --> 00:24:43,219
(Missed call)

365
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:51,459
Let's have some music on.

366
00:24:52,689 --> 00:24:53,730
Yes, Ms. Kim?

367
00:24:53,889 --> 00:24:55,429
You said you were attending a reunion tonight, right?

368
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,030
Where and what time is it held?

369
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,030
It starts at 7pm.

370
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:01,530
- Why do you ask? - Thanks.

371
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:04,340
Hello?

372
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:19,649
Why won't you answer my calls?

373
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:21,889
That way, you'll come looking for me.

374
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:24,820
What are you doing right now?

375
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,560
I heard you met Seo Yun.

376
00:25:32,899 --> 00:25:34,070
My mother found out.

377
00:25:35,199 --> 00:25:36,369
Right now,

378
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:41,070
she's making a fuss to send Seo Yun abroad.

379
00:25:43,109 --> 00:25:44,179
So?

380
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,879
You know Anchor Jang is our client, right?

381
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:49,050
Step away from this case.

382
00:25:49,419 --> 00:25:53,050
Then, I'll find a way to talk things out with my mother.

383
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:57,020
How do you keep showing your worst every time I see you?

384
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:59,958
You're making deals with Seo Yun now?

385
00:25:59,959 --> 00:26:03,599
By that way, why are you always with Dong Gi Jun?

386
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,030
Why do you care?

387
00:26:05,699 --> 00:26:08,330
You're Seo Yun's mom.

388
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:12,408
How are you seeing the guy you met before getting married?

389
00:26:12,409 --> 00:26:13,769
Don't you feel ashamed to see your son?

390
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:17,340
- Hey! You just... - CEO Noh Yul Seong?

391
00:26:19,609 --> 00:26:20,649
It's been a while.

392
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,449
Are you okay, Ms. Kim?

393
00:26:25,179 --> 00:26:27,050
You should've just walked away.

394
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,760
Why butt in to a married couple's business?

395
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:32,929
Oh, right.

396
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:37,959
But aren't you two divorced?

397
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:42,230
To my knowledge, you two are much further apart than us two.

398
00:26:47,109 --> 00:26:48,169
"Us two?"

399
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,879
You left your car, right?

400
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,379
I'll grab you a cab.

401
00:26:53,609 --> 00:26:56,320
No matter where you hide Seo Yun, I'll find him.

402
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,090
I will make sure to watch Seo Yun grow.

403
00:27:15,199 --> 00:27:16,840
Just drop me off by the main entrance.

404
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:18,639
I can just take a cab.

405
00:27:28,879 --> 00:27:29,949
Thank you.

406
00:28:18,129 --> 00:28:20,199
- Get in. - Are you not going back?

407
00:28:20,570 --> 00:28:21,800
I'm here to eat.

408
00:28:22,699 --> 00:28:24,040
I don't need to go if you're buying.

409
00:28:31,909 --> 00:28:33,679
Are there more people coming?

410
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,579
You two are my saviors.

411
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:39,218
You saved me.

412
00:28:39,219 --> 00:28:41,350
And you were the one that destroyed my ex.

413
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:44,859
It's so lovely to see you two together.

414
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:48,459
Wasn't I right? Isn't he such a great guy?

415
00:28:51,899 --> 00:28:53,770
- He is. - I told you.

416
00:28:53,929 --> 00:28:56,398
Isn't Sa Ra amazing too?

417
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:58,269
- I was right, wasn't I? - I was surprised.

418
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:00,770
Solution is under the hands of you two.

419
00:29:00,869 --> 00:29:02,708
- It's a pleasure to work with you. - Right.

420
00:29:02,709 --> 00:29:04,909
Sa Ra and Gi Jun. The Sa-Gi Couple.

421
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,449
Thank you for the food.

422
00:29:14,949 --> 00:29:16,959
I meant it.

423
00:29:17,419 --> 00:29:18,489
I was surprised.

424
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:21,159
No, I am continuing to get surprised.

425
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:23,330
I'm seeing your new sides too.

426
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,199
Why did you start this job?

427
00:29:32,439 --> 00:29:35,270
I wanted to save people who are suffering from their married lives.

428
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:41,148
There are a lot of people who are suffering...

429
00:29:41,149 --> 00:29:43,149
because they don't know how to free themselves.

430
00:29:46,189 --> 00:29:49,090
Don't you have any dreams for yourself?

431
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:51,560
Me?

432
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:57,699
That'll be sending away that person we saw earlier.

433
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,600
Far away into space.

434
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:04,740
Deep into the fiery pit.

435
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,918
Didn't you ask to have dinner to find out...

436
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:19,249
how I'm doing with Noh Yul Seong?

437
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:21,990
Yes. What? Oh, well...

438
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:25,359
Have you been learning how to read minds?

439
00:30:28,629 --> 00:30:32,000
That way, I can bring my child back.

440
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:39,469
We'll find a way.

441
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:42,139
A way to make that dream come true.

442
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,379
Why would you help me?

443
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,109
Exactly. Why would I?

444
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:52,149
Well, it'll be out of teamwork?

445
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:54,850
Comradeship?

446
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:59,729
- Let's drink up. - My glass is almost empty.

447
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:00,790
Got it.

448
00:31:08,629 --> 00:31:10,639
Here. Cheers.

449
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,810
Goodness.

450
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,580
What's wrong? Did you forget something?

451
00:31:19,409 --> 00:31:20,809
Where's my phone?

452
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:22,310
Pass it here.

453
00:31:27,649 --> 00:31:28,719
What's this?

454
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:31,359
(Sa-Gi Couple's 787 days together, Feeling happy, you lovebirds?)

455
00:31:35,859 --> 00:31:37,260
What is it?

456
00:31:38,859 --> 00:31:39,929
What's wrong?

457
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:44,668
- What's wrong? - Gosh.

458
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:45,669
Come on.

459
00:31:48,969 --> 00:31:52,379
So this is the Sa-Gi Couple.

460
00:31:55,449 --> 00:31:58,849
Bom found this post.

461
00:31:58,850 --> 00:31:59,949
I told her to keep it a secret.

462
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:01,350
I see.

463
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,559
If I were to throw this away in the office,

464
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,789
the cleaning lady might see it.

465
00:32:07,790 --> 00:32:09,458
I brought it with me to throw it away at home.

466
00:32:09,459 --> 00:32:10,530
I didn't say anything.

467
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:16,270
Put it back in.

468
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,449
Did you even think of me?

469
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:29,780
I told you earlier that I was busy with life.

470
00:32:32,179 --> 00:32:33,919
No matter how busy you are with life,

471
00:32:35,090 --> 00:32:36,859
there's always time to miss someone.

472
00:32:40,189 --> 00:32:42,090
That's how thinking works.

473
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:45,659
It would be a lie to say I didn't think about you at all.

474
00:32:45,959 --> 00:32:47,270
- But, that's... - Done.

475
00:32:48,270 --> 00:32:50,869
To say that you thought about me... You thought...

476
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:53,669
That's all I need to know. You thought about me?

477
00:32:55,810 --> 00:32:56,939
My gosh.

478
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:59,040
You thought about me?

479
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:16,859
(Chayul Law Firm Lawyer...)

480
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:38,320
Gosh, that was embarrassing.

481
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:41,090
(Phone missing. What is a way to find it?)

482
00:33:41,189 --> 00:33:42,219

483
00:33:42,619 --> 00:33:44,619

(Seo Woong Jin's Fatal Fall Incident)

485
00:33:53,699 --> 00:33:56,070
We're looking the same direction again.

486
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:10,520
Why won't you answer my calls?

487
00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:14,388
Hey. I told you to keep things quiet.

488
00:34:14,389 --> 00:34:15,949
Why would you come all the way here?

489
00:34:16,049 --> 00:34:17,319
We're in big trouble.

490
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:19,319
This is under embargo until tomorrow.

491
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:22,028
Assemblyman Han Joo Hyuk. Your father-in-law!

492
00:34:22,029 --> 00:34:23,099
He's in trouble.

493
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,199
He's been linked with illegal solicitation.

494
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,769
This can't be happening at this time.

495
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:30,199
What will we do?

496
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:39,110
(Limited approval)

497
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,420
My gosh.

498
00:34:50,259 --> 00:34:52,959
You're smiling ear to ear. Stop looking so happy.

499
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,230
Oh, really? Quiet coyote!

(Sa-Gi Couple's 787 days together, Feeling happy, you lovebirds?)

501
00:35:11,009 --> 00:35:12,779
Bring me Lee Joo Won's photos.

502
00:35:13,179 --> 00:35:14,880
There are photos of her before and after marriage, right?

503
00:35:40,469 --> 00:35:42,009
Call Ms. Lee to the office.

504
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:53,190
It was like seeing my own wedding photo.

505
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:57,889
The bride who feels the weight of the tiara...

506
00:35:58,089 --> 00:36:00,259
like a plate of armor.

507
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:03,429
I looked just like that.

508
00:36:04,659 --> 00:36:06,730
"Is this marriage a good idea?"

509
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:09,739
"Will I be able to manage?"

510
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:12,699
"No. There's nothing I can do now."

511
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:17,580
This is the face you make...

512
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:20,880
after around the 99th thought.

513
00:36:25,319 --> 00:36:28,619
There's a story behind this marriage, right?

514
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:42,230
You said you felt his loss.

515
00:36:43,400 --> 00:36:44,799
I just feel like he'll lose.

516
00:36:46,069 --> 00:36:47,569
I'm his wife, after all.

517
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,909
I believe what you said could be related to it.

518
00:36:59,619 --> 00:37:00,690
The same thing...

519
00:37:02,089 --> 00:37:03,920
happened to me.

520
00:37:04,659 --> 00:37:06,089
Just like Seo Min Hee.

521
00:37:07,089 --> 00:37:08,429
It was Jang Jae Gook?

522
00:37:11,759 --> 00:37:13,770
We got married because I got pregnant.

523
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,069
We lived in the same area.

524
00:37:20,909 --> 00:37:22,869
I was just invited for a drink.

525
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,179
At that moment,

526
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,779
I just thought about the child inside me.

527
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:34,089
My husband kept clinging on to me as well.

528
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:41,329
That was when you should have sorted things out!

529
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:42,989
As soon as you thought things weren't right!

530
00:37:43,259 --> 00:37:44,460
But how?

531
00:37:45,759 --> 00:37:48,369
What else could I have done during that moment?

532
00:37:49,869 --> 00:37:53,210
I persuaded myself with lies every single day.

533
00:37:54,969 --> 00:37:56,639
"We're a family."

534
00:37:57,909 --> 00:38:00,949
But I'm going insane after this case.

535
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,619
It kept reminding me of those times.

536
00:38:11,319 --> 00:38:13,389
My heart was beating like crazy all day long.

537
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,929
I came here because I couldn't stand it.

538
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:19,699
Then,

539
00:38:21,969 --> 00:38:24,400
the reason you went to meet Seo Min Hee was because...

540
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:26,710
I would be able to tell...

541
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:29,980
if she went through the same thing I did.

542
00:38:35,509 --> 00:38:39,049
But you revealed Min Hee's texts like that?

543
00:38:42,049 --> 00:38:43,920
"A sex offender's daughter."

544
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:48,028
I didn't want my Soo Ji to be called that.

545
00:38:48,029 --> 00:38:49,960
I was out of my mind.

546
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:55,069
I rather wanted to believe it was an affair.

547
00:38:55,799 --> 00:38:58,600
But now,

548
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:01,009
I deeply regret what I did.

549
00:39:01,469 --> 00:39:05,908
First of all, I will bring up what you went through before marriage.

550
00:39:05,909 --> 00:39:08,049
That would be big enough to bring up a divorce.

551
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:12,020
No. I will keep this a secret to my grave.

552
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:14,388
You must keep this a secret.

553
00:39:14,389 --> 00:39:15,719
Ms. Lee!

554
00:39:15,949 --> 00:39:17,089
My Soo Ji...

555
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:22,230
She must never find out how she was born. Never!

556
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:37,278
It was the 10th at 1pm.

557
00:39:37,279 --> 00:39:40,579
Anchor Jang Jae Gook of JBC got attacked by an assailant...

558
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:42,379
and became unconscious.

559
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,749
Anchor Jang, who has regained consciousness,

560
00:39:43,750 --> 00:39:45,079
told the police...

561
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,888
that as soon as he opened the door to his office for Ms. Seo,

562
00:39:47,889 --> 00:39:50,659
the one who has pressed charges against him for sexual assault...

563
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:57,158
Anchor Jang, who has regained consciousness,

564
00:39:57,159 --> 00:39:58,830
told the police that as soon as he...

565
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:02,929
("Anchor Jang Attacked by the Victim of Sexual Assault")

566
00:40:04,139 --> 00:40:05,569
There we go.

567
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:14,350
("Anchor Jang Attacked by the Victim of Sexual Assault")

568
00:40:15,449 --> 00:40:17,980
You saw a drone in the news footage?

569
00:40:18,279 --> 00:40:21,219
Drones are restricted from apartment complexes.

570
00:40:21,389 --> 00:40:22,520
Those areas.

571
00:40:23,489 --> 00:40:25,489
But spotting a drone there...

572
00:40:25,759 --> 00:40:28,359
means that there are people secret filming...

573
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,429
There it is.

574
00:40:30,259 --> 00:40:32,060
It means they're back out.

575
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:36,798
I was right. The ones who got caught recently...

576
00:40:36,799 --> 00:40:38,638
started moving again in this area.

577
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:39,639
This way.

578
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:42,909
Prosecutor Dong, would they recognize...

579
00:40:43,009 --> 00:40:45,509
No, Lawyer Dong. Would they recognize who you are?

580
00:40:46,009 --> 00:40:48,379
If they try to get away after seeing me,

581
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:49,480
it's them for sure.

582
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:50,580
Okay.

583
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:54,190
This way. Why are you trying to take the lead?

584
00:41:05,429 --> 00:41:06,460
I feel nervous.

585
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,199
Don't be.

586
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:15,069
Who is it?

587
00:41:16,139 --> 00:41:18,710
I'm here for a gas inspection.

588
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:24,350
How have you been?

589
00:41:25,219 --> 00:41:26,889
Hello. Darn it!

590
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:28,750
Hey!

591
00:41:29,549 --> 00:41:31,560
That darn punk.

592
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:43,069
You punk.

593
00:41:45,799 --> 00:41:46,869
Gosh.

594
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,980
Gosh. Why is it so slow?

595
00:41:53,810 --> 00:41:54,949
What are you doing?

596
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:06,159
Darn it.

597
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:13,100
- Why are you running away? - Darn it.

598
00:42:17,369 --> 00:42:18,670
That punk.

599
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,790
Darn it! I'm sorry.

600
00:42:38,190 --> 00:42:39,259
Gosh.

601
00:42:43,259 --> 00:42:44,330
I apologize!

602
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:50,000
Hey, stop right there!

603
00:42:50,069 --> 00:42:51,100
Stop!

604
00:42:54,569 --> 00:42:56,009
Hey, are you okay?

605
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:58,480
- Are you okay? We're very sorry. - Hey!

606
00:43:00,779 --> 00:43:02,610
Stop following me!

607
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:04,350
We're not here for you.

608
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:06,219
Darn it!

609
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:08,850
Hey! I'm exhausted.

610
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,299
My goodness.

611
00:43:23,029 --> 00:43:24,540
Just stay still for a while.

612
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:27,309
Hey, let's talk!

613
00:43:27,310 --> 00:43:28,310
(Blocked)

614
00:43:30,239 --> 00:43:31,310
Oh, gosh.

615
00:43:32,279 --> 00:43:35,080
We won't get him. Darn it!

616
00:43:38,819 --> 00:43:40,250
(Illegal dumping prohibited)

617
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:44,020
- Get over here. - Darn it!

618
00:43:45,719 --> 00:43:47,429
Do you wish to die? How dare you?

619
00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:57,239
What are you doing?

620
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:08,880
You're going to get him for good.

621
00:44:11,350 --> 00:44:12,520
It's okay.

622
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:16,719
Do you wish to run away for the rest of your life?

623
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,520
Give us the drone footage from three days ago.

624
00:44:19,619 --> 00:44:21,428
- Why do you want that? - Don't ask!

625
00:44:21,429 --> 00:44:23,730
Gosh. Stay calm.

626
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:26,460
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

627
00:44:31,239 --> 00:44:32,869
Will we see the rooftop now?

628
00:44:37,409 --> 00:44:38,810
All right. Right there.

629
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:42,678
There! Right there!

630
00:44:42,679 --> 00:44:45,818
Jang Jae Gook testified that the incident occurred at 1pm.

631
00:44:45,819 --> 00:44:48,289
But Lee Joo Won's rooftop footage...

632
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:52,060
starts from 12:50pm to 1:05pm.

633
00:44:52,389 --> 00:44:53,389
Yes!

634
00:44:54,089 --> 00:44:56,529
What a relief. We've proved your alibi.

635
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:00,229
But things don't end here.

636
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:01,230
Let's take another look.

637
00:45:02,799 --> 00:45:04,170
Look closely here.

638
00:45:11,009 --> 00:45:13,509
What? Seo Min Hee still hasn't gone inside!

639
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:17,879
But Anchor Jang said he was attacked by Seo Min Hee.

640
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:19,080
That was a lie.

641
00:45:21,389 --> 00:45:23,319
Was there any sort of attack?

642
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:27,989
Exactly.

643
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:29,860
So everything's a lie.

644
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:33,130
Okay. There's our answer.

645
00:45:34,069 --> 00:45:35,630
Jang Jae Gook lied.

646
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:38,368
Let's make that big fat liar pay.

647
00:45:38,369 --> 00:45:39,440
- Understood! - Understood!

648
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:41,509
Big fat what?

649
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,580
You've been through so much.

650
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:48,480
Thank you so much.

651
00:45:48,779 --> 00:45:50,920
The footage will be sent to the investigation team.

652
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:53,919
Lawyer Dong, you're already making a mark.

653
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,318
You can't be this charming.

654
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:56,350
Aren't I right, Ms. Kim?

655
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:58,989
Lawyer Dong,

656
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:01,330
you've also gone through a lot.

657
00:46:02,529 --> 00:46:05,600
So we'll be back to solving divorce matters, right?

658
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:09,969
You should receive the baton.

659
00:46:16,639 --> 00:46:19,839
There! A handshake too.

660
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:27,420
If I give up,

661
00:46:29,489 --> 00:46:30,520
it's only...

662
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:32,989
Hey, Kim Sa Ra!

663
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:35,529
Hey, what's going on?

664
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:38,028
Prosecutor Dong, no. I heard Lawyer Dong is here.

665
00:46:38,029 --> 00:46:39,060
Is this true?

666
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:40,630
I can't believe it.

667
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:42,429
Are you working in the same office?

668
00:46:43,469 --> 00:46:45,239
- No. - Then?

669
00:46:54,049 --> 00:46:56,179
Are you guys starting something again?

670
00:46:56,850 --> 00:46:58,149
Tell me!

671
00:46:58,150 --> 00:47:00,318
Did you run all the way here just to ask about that?

672
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:01,420
Of course.

673
00:47:01,589 --> 00:47:03,149
He's good-looking and has a nice body.

674
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:04,888
Money? I'm not really sure about that.

675
00:47:04,889 --> 00:47:08,060
Anyway, he's super qualified and single too.

676
00:47:09,659 --> 00:47:12,798
My friend Kim Sa Ra met her ex who's single...

677
00:47:12,799 --> 00:47:14,568
after five years.

678
00:47:14,569 --> 00:47:16,469
So he never got married.

679
00:47:18,739 --> 00:47:20,310
What's with that indifferent reaction?

680
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:22,069
Are you seeing someone?

681
00:47:23,139 --> 00:47:25,839
Anyway, I'm definitely casting my vote for Lawyer Dong.

682
00:47:26,779 --> 00:47:29,549
Did he not ask about why you didn't show up?

683
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:33,080
Well, he doesn't know.

684
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:37,689
Gosh, you were totally wasted that night.

685
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:39,119
- With Noh Yul Seong... - Hey!

686
00:47:39,219 --> 00:47:40,219
Oh, gosh.

687
00:48:00,549 --> 00:48:02,849
Are you not coming to get your bridal makeup done?

688
00:48:02,850 --> 00:48:05,079
Yul Seong is at the wedding hall.

689
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:06,880
- You should hurry. - You're on your way, right?

690
00:48:07,719 --> 00:48:08,850
I'm at the airport.

691
00:48:30,940 --> 00:48:32,739
(Meeting Point, West)

692
00:48:51,759 --> 00:48:53,299
I'm in front of Gate 6.

693
00:48:54,029 --> 00:48:55,069
I'm waiting here.

694
00:48:55,330 --> 00:48:56,929
(I'm in front of Gate 6. I'm waiting here.)

695
00:49:11,319 --> 00:49:13,889
(Meeting Point, West)

696
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:48,690
Ms. Kim!

697
00:49:52,719 --> 00:49:53,719
It's Chayul Law Firm.

698
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:55,459
They set things up with a lie.

699
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:58,059
Chayul met up with Seo Min Hee's lawyer in secret.

700
00:49:58,060 --> 00:49:59,060
With Jang Jae Gook too.

701
00:49:59,061 --> 00:50:00,928
- Can we go in? - Come in.

702
00:50:00,929 --> 00:50:02,368
- Come in. - I should go home.

703
00:50:02,369 --> 00:50:03,799
- This is home. - This way.

704
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:05,899
Was that before the assault?

705
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:08,469
Yes. It sounds super fishy.

706
00:50:15,279 --> 00:50:16,279
Ms. Lee.

707
00:50:17,279 --> 00:50:19,819
Would you like to go for the plan I mentioned earlier?

708
00:50:21,350 --> 00:50:22,520
This plan...

709
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:28,989
involves joining forces with the foe.

710
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:39,869
That day, the lawyer asked to see me...

711
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:42,069
at Anchor Jang's office.

712
00:50:42,270 --> 00:50:43,369
It was to settle an agreement.

713
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:48,380
But it sounded suspicious.

714
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:51,020
I was making a call to refuse to go in.

715
00:50:51,179 --> 00:50:52,250
It's a relief...

716
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:54,219
that his alibi was proven wrong.

717
00:50:54,520 --> 00:50:55,549
But...

718
00:50:56,819 --> 00:50:59,020
my lawyer met up with Jang Jae Gook's side?

719
00:50:59,719 --> 00:51:00,759
Yes.

720
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:03,630
Why are you helping me?

721
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:06,759
There's someone...

722
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,869
who wants to take your side.

723
00:51:28,389 --> 00:51:30,150
I was out of my mind.

724
00:51:31,259 --> 00:51:33,420
I apologize.

725
00:51:35,330 --> 00:51:36,360
Forget it.

726
00:51:37,029 --> 00:51:38,399
Will acting this way change anything?

727
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:39,429
I thought this to myself...

728
00:51:41,299 --> 00:51:43,670
while seeing my daughter get harassed.

729
00:51:43,940 --> 00:51:47,270
"My daughter is getting punished instead of me."

730
00:51:47,369 --> 00:51:49,509
Forget it. Get up.

731
00:52:01,350 --> 00:52:02,920
Why would I side with you?

732
00:52:04,819 --> 00:52:05,819
He...

733
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:08,290
attacked me too.

734
00:52:08,589 --> 00:52:11,060
Just like how he attacked you.

735
00:52:11,730 --> 00:52:13,259
That's how we ended up getting married.

736
00:52:16,130 --> 00:52:17,540
And we've come this far.

737
00:52:19,199 --> 00:52:20,299
You've done well...

738
00:52:21,069 --> 00:52:22,610
to make it this far with him.

739
00:52:22,770 --> 00:52:24,980
I know you can't forgive me.

740
00:52:25,080 --> 00:52:26,440
- But... - I can't.

741
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:30,779
I can't forgive both you and your husband.

742
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:33,449
Don't forgive her.

743
00:52:33,779 --> 00:52:35,449
This isn't about reconciliation.

744
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,759
This is about winning against Jang Jae Gook.

745
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:41,429
But it'll be tough for you two...

746
00:52:42,029 --> 00:52:43,230
to fight alone.

747
00:52:43,560 --> 00:52:46,199
This is why I'm suggesting that you two...

748
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:47,830
join forces.

749
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:51,439
The assailant fears it the most...

750
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:53,170
when the victims join forces.

751
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:57,210
There's no way out when the victims speak as one.

752
00:53:01,549 --> 00:53:03,179
Please contact us after much consideration.

753
00:53:03,949 --> 00:53:06,619
And make sure to get a new lawyer even if it isn't us.

754
00:53:15,159 --> 00:53:16,159
Let's go.

755
00:53:22,830 --> 00:53:23,830
We'll be off.

756
00:53:38,250 --> 00:53:40,818
Hanjoo Party's Han Joo Hyuk has been arrested.

757
00:53:40,819 --> 00:53:41,819
He's the first chairman...

758
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:43,149
of the Legislation and Judiciary Committee...

759
00:53:43,150 --> 00:53:44,189
to ever get arrested.

760
00:53:44,190 --> 00:53:45,759
Assemblyman Han is currently denying...

761
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:50,859
How can your wife not be of use for at least a year?

762
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:51,860
My father-in-law...

763
00:53:52,759 --> 00:53:55,969
took a fall before nominations by the party representative.

764
00:53:56,170 --> 00:53:57,798
He should've passed the law school law...

765
00:53:57,799 --> 00:53:59,500
before ending up like that.

766
00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:01,909
I might as well just become an assemblyman myself.

767
00:54:05,310 --> 00:54:06,338
The party representative and your father-in-law...

768
00:54:06,339 --> 00:54:07,379
are great enemies.

769
00:54:07,380 --> 00:54:08,380
Would he give you a nomination?

770
00:54:11,319 --> 00:54:12,480
You told me this before.

771
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:16,520
You don't look for ways. You make them.

772
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:36,369
The Me Too case looks to be under our hands.

773
00:54:37,310 --> 00:54:39,210
You must not surf the web that often.

774
00:54:40,779 --> 00:54:43,210
But we're talking about a divorce.

775
00:54:44,179 --> 00:54:45,250
Exactly.

776
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:47,020
If we win the Me Too case,

777
00:54:47,179 --> 00:54:50,350
it's obvious how things will pan out with the divorce.

778
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:53,360
Lawyer Ma.

779
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:56,388
Are there any reasons for liability...

780
00:54:56,389 --> 00:54:58,360
for Anchor Jang to break down a marriage?

781
00:54:59,929 --> 00:55:01,730
Any cases of violence, gambling,

782
00:55:02,330 --> 00:55:04,500
or things like mental weakness.

783
00:55:09,509 --> 00:55:12,239
Not at all, sir.

784
00:55:12,610 --> 00:55:15,409
Then why is Lawyer Dong being so stubborn about it?

785
00:55:21,049 --> 00:55:23,089
Jang Jae Gook's shamelessness...

786
00:55:26,119 --> 00:55:27,529
which really reminds me of someone.

787
00:55:32,529 --> 00:55:35,000
You should've been a better coach.

788
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:40,969
That night, I didn't want it to happen.

789
00:55:42,610 --> 00:55:44,110
That night?

790
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:46,110
What are you talking about?

791
00:55:55,549 --> 00:55:57,150
That day 18 years ago.

792
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:01,460
The moment I couldn't control my body...

793
00:56:02,529 --> 00:56:04,860
as if I was suffering from sleep paralysis.

794
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:11,969
Really, what nonsense are you spouting now?

795
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:13,469
Right.

796
00:56:14,469 --> 00:56:16,270
Telling you this now will only make you claim...

797
00:56:16,770 --> 00:56:19,339
that I'm making up a story to get a divorce.

798
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:24,380
But what if there's another person who suffered the same thing I did?

799
00:56:33,819 --> 00:56:35,630
People don't believe me.

800
00:56:37,529 --> 00:56:40,159
"She hit on him. She's an adulteress."

801
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:42,069
I'm everyone's topic of gossip.

802
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:49,568
But things would be different if more victims went through...

803
00:56:49,569 --> 00:56:50,909
the same experience.

804
00:56:51,009 --> 00:56:52,408
What are you two doing?

805
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:55,610
We're getting our story straight to testify against you in the trial.

806
00:56:56,710 --> 00:56:59,150
Did he do that to you 18 years ago without your consent?

807
00:56:59,350 --> 00:57:00,380
Yes.

808
00:57:01,319 --> 00:57:03,750
It was the same with you, right, Ms. Seo?

809
00:57:05,159 --> 00:57:06,159
Yes.

810
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:09,690
Are you kidding me?

811
00:57:10,159 --> 00:57:13,429
Honey. Shouldn't you think about Soo Ji?

812
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:16,428
We're a married couple. How can you disclose it publicly?

813
00:57:16,429 --> 00:57:19,199
Why shouldn't I when you were in the wrong?

814
00:57:22,739 --> 00:57:25,980
You two have gone mad, haven't you?

815
00:57:26,839 --> 00:57:29,778
Listen. Since when did we have to get consent...

816
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:31,349
for doing that?

817
00:57:31,350 --> 00:57:33,149
I doubt even judges and prosecutors do that.

818
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:35,048
And so you didn't either?

819
00:57:35,049 --> 00:57:36,690
No, I didn't!

820
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:39,560
Consent, my foot.

821
00:57:41,889 --> 00:57:43,459
Can't you tell at a glance?

822
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:46,259
A guy who asks for consent is a total fool.

823
00:57:57,069 --> 00:58:00,109
What do you think will happen...

824
00:58:00,110 --> 00:58:03,449
if Ms. Lee gives testimony in Ms. Seo's trial?

825
00:58:05,949 --> 00:58:08,190
(Uncontested Divorce Agreement)

826
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:11,290
It's in the condition she doesn't testify in court.

827
00:58:24,299 --> 00:58:27,969
There won't be any divorce by mutual agreement...

828
00:58:28,710 --> 00:58:30,369
the moment that goes public.

829
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:32,480
All right.

830
00:58:49,929 --> 00:58:52,630
Noh Yul Seong has completely lost his temper.

831
00:58:53,529 --> 00:58:54,599
You kicked his butt.

832
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:55,929
But that's not enough.

833
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:58,239
He must be sent to the pen.

834
00:58:59,139 --> 00:59:00,139
"Pen?"

835
00:59:01,139 --> 00:59:02,339
There's this thing.

836
00:59:04,270 --> 00:59:07,279
By the way, don't drop the honorifics in the office.

837
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:12,279
Got it, Sa Ra.

838
00:59:14,350 --> 00:59:16,690
We're in the elevator right now, not the office.

839
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:25,500
- Hey. You're ready, right? - Yes.

840
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:27,000
We'll be there in 30 minutes.

841
00:59:30,330 --> 00:59:33,270
Sa Ra. Wait for me.

842
00:59:34,170 --> 00:59:35,210
Sa Ra?

843
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:45,549
- Hi. - Oh, hi.

844
00:59:46,119 --> 00:59:48,250
What is there to examine to make me come and go?

845
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:12,110
(To Reporter Heo Eun Young: We should grab a meal together.)

846
01:00:30,889 --> 01:00:32,659
Weren't we going to the director's office?

847
01:00:33,429 --> 01:00:35,400
What? Who are you?

848
01:00:38,069 --> 01:00:40,469
Who are you two? What are you doing?

849
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:52,048
Good grief. What's this?

850
01:00:52,049 --> 01:00:53,920
Are you the warriors of Earth or something?

851
01:00:54,449 --> 01:00:56,619
Didn't you agree to the divorce terms?

852
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:58,659
So what now?

853
01:01:00,619 --> 01:01:02,460
We're on the same side.

854
01:01:05,500 --> 01:01:06,500
What?

855
01:01:06,501 --> 01:01:08,499
Even if Ms. Seo wins the Me Too trial,

856
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:11,540
her suffering won't end if she loses in the public opinion trial.

857
01:01:11,869 --> 01:01:14,569
As such, we have decided to work together...

858
01:01:14,670 --> 01:01:16,738
to show people that the real witch here is you,

859
01:01:16,739 --> 01:01:19,408
Jang Jae Gook, and not Seo Min Hee.

860
01:01:19,409 --> 01:01:20,579
What real witch?

861
01:01:20,580 --> 01:01:23,850
Don't look so surprised. The real deal starts now.

862
01:01:30,219 --> 01:01:31,520
- Gosh... - What?

863
01:01:32,290 --> 01:01:34,319
- Please excuse me for a moment. - What?

864
01:01:35,089 --> 01:01:36,389
What are you...

865
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:54,380
Now then, let's go.

866
01:01:56,310 --> 01:01:57,310
Where are we going?

867
01:02:15,069 --> 01:02:17,670
- It's a miracle! - Nice.

868
01:02:19,339 --> 01:02:21,209
I should've known when you were admitted...

869
01:02:21,210 --> 01:02:23,908
to this hospital connected with Chayul.

870
01:02:23,909 --> 01:02:25,739
I was too late, wasn't I?

871
01:02:26,339 --> 01:02:29,210
Self-fabricated scenarios usually end with two weeks of treatment.

872
01:02:30,850 --> 01:02:33,779
I guess you weren't confident to change the public opinion with it.

873
01:02:34,179 --> 01:02:35,889
You even went into a coma.

874
01:02:38,159 --> 01:02:40,118
Aren't you being too harsh on me?

875
01:02:40,119 --> 01:02:44,698
No. You were always a bothersome being in my life.

876
01:02:44,699 --> 01:02:46,900
I should've gotten rid of you sooner.

877
01:02:47,759 --> 01:02:50,230
Do you realize that it's over for you now?

878
01:02:51,130 --> 01:02:52,170
And totally, at that.

879
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:01,880
You...

880
01:03:02,949 --> 01:03:05,419
Are you family wreckers? Are you?

881
01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:06,448
What do you know?

882
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:08,549
How dare you act up after sweet-talking a naive woman?

883
01:03:08,650 --> 01:03:11,319
You're right. We don't know much. No, except for one.

884
01:03:11,659 --> 01:03:14,360
We know she's not happy because of her husband.

885
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:16,959
Who said that? I love my wife dearly.

886
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:17,960
She must be happy.

887
01:03:17,961 --> 01:03:19,159
What's love?

888
01:03:19,900 --> 01:03:20,900
What?

889
01:03:21,469 --> 01:03:22,929
It's trust.

890
01:03:23,029 --> 01:03:26,238
You love the person as much as you trust them.

891
01:03:26,239 --> 01:03:28,868
Ms. Lee started with zero trust in you...

892
01:03:28,869 --> 01:03:31,439
after it was destroyed entirely.

893
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,540
But what? "Love?"

894
01:03:33,880 --> 01:03:35,380
How can she love you?

895
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:38,420
"Happy?" Is your happiness all that matters?

896
01:03:39,150 --> 01:03:40,718
Who are you to talk back at me?

897
01:03:40,719 --> 01:03:43,149
What? Are you the only one who can talk back?

898
01:03:43,150 --> 01:03:44,150
Hey...

899
01:03:44,589 --> 01:03:46,489
You asked me what I knew to act up, right?

900
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:48,560
What about you?

901
01:03:49,230 --> 01:03:51,130
How much do you know about your wife?

902
01:03:55,069 --> 01:03:57,230
- What... - By the way, I'll stand witness...

903
01:03:57,330 --> 01:03:59,269
in Ms. Seo's trial.

904
01:03:59,270 --> 01:04:00,638
If Ms. Lee does it,

905
01:04:00,639 --> 01:04:02,639
the mutual agreement divorce will go down the drain.

906
01:04:04,509 --> 01:04:05,540
Look forward to it.

907
01:04:31,869 --> 01:04:33,369
We're leaving for the gates now.

908
01:04:34,739 --> 01:04:37,670
I told Soo Ji about our conversation...

909
01:04:37,909 --> 01:04:39,940
about not wasting too much time...

910
01:04:40,639 --> 01:04:42,548
on what hurt us.

911
01:04:42,549 --> 01:04:44,650
Good. Let's only think about...

912
01:04:45,150 --> 01:04:48,549
how to get back on our feet and not what hurt us.

913
01:04:50,389 --> 01:04:51,719
Congratulations on your divorce.

914
01:04:55,730 --> 01:04:57,130
How may I help you?

915
01:05:05,670 --> 01:05:08,339
Please help me.

916
01:05:11,139 --> 01:05:12,139
I'm...

917
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:19,549
the wife of Chayul Law Firm's CEO, Noh Yul Seong.

918
01:05:20,449 --> 01:05:21,549
I'm Han Ji In.

919
01:05:46,210 --> 01:05:48,250
(Queen of Divorce)

920
01:06:16,610 --> 01:06:18,779
I think my husband is holding my weakness.

921
01:06:18,880 --> 01:06:19,880
Guess what this is.

922
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:22,049
You should be picky about your clients.

923
01:06:22,150 --> 01:06:24,049
You won't defend my wife, will you?

924
01:06:24,150 --> 01:06:26,419
Too bad. I'm getting fired up now that...

925
01:06:26,420 --> 01:06:27,850
you're telling me not to do it.

926
01:06:28,190 --> 01:06:30,750
You want me to go through Noh Yul Seong's office?

927
01:06:30,850 --> 01:06:33,718
I'm a judicial officer, not a troubleshooter.

928
01:06:33,719 --> 01:06:35,360
- Okay? - Honey!

929
01:06:35,690 --> 01:06:39,060
Making a scene at your ex-husband's workplace is uncivilized.

930
01:06:40,259 --> 01:06:41,729
Isn't the jerk...

931
01:06:41,730 --> 01:06:44,230
who kidnapped his wife much more uncivilized?

932
01:06:45,139 --> 01:06:46,139
It's hot!

933
01:06:46,140 --> 01:06:47,669
Did you always cross the line so easily?

934
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:49,310
I've never crossed it, not even now.

935
01:06:50,139 --> 01:06:53,540
Though I'm the one who decides where the line is.
