00:00:25,929 --> 00:00:27,499
(Oh Min Suk)

(Queen of Divorce)

5
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:48,149
What's wrong with you?

6
00:00:50,279 --> 00:00:51,420
Aren't you sending the flowers away?

7
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:58,130
I'll just take them.

8
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:02,329
Noh Yul Seong sent them.

9
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,230
He wants to marry me again.

10
00:01:10,169 --> 00:01:11,169
Who?

11
00:01:13,209 --> 00:01:14,280
Noh Yul Seong?

12
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,410
So?

13
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:19,649
I'm going to...

14
00:01:21,919 --> 00:01:22,919
go back to his house.

15
00:01:31,729 --> 00:01:33,429
I'll make him go to prison.

16
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:36,030
Are you going to live as his wife again?

17
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:39,199
No, I'm going to trick him.

18
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,600
As if I became his wife.

19
00:01:40,699 --> 00:01:41,699
My goodness.

20
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:45,038
This is too much. You know, right?

21
00:01:45,039 --> 00:01:46,569
Staking everything. If we fail, it's the end.

22
00:01:48,679 --> 00:01:50,740
There's no other way.

23
00:02:02,559 --> 00:02:04,559
There is another way.

24
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,898
I told you we're starting from Na Yu Mi's taxi driver again.

25
00:02:07,899 --> 00:02:09,059
If that were to work,

26
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,830
it should've worked when you were investigating as a prosecutor.

27
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:17,970
You don't believe in me.

28
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:21,440
No, I mean...

29
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:25,179
Professor Seo killed himself right after Na Yu Mi's case started.

30
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:27,620
So you got fired, and all stopped.

31
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,949
We are trying to reinvestigate, but all the clues are gone.

32
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:33,220
So,

33
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:37,289
what can you do in his house?

34
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,759
On the day my mom passed away,

35
00:02:43,859 --> 00:02:46,269
I'm going to find out who was sitting next to her.

36
00:02:47,199 --> 00:02:48,539
If that was Noh Yul Seong,

37
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,069
or if there's another person behind this.

38
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,579
What if you fail?

39
00:02:57,509 --> 00:02:59,449
What's the end of this remarriage?

40
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,680
I don't think about anything impossible.

41
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,419
I only think about something possible.

42
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,100
Noh Yul Seong!

43
00:03:18,669 --> 00:03:19,699
What's going on?

44
00:03:21,739 --> 00:03:23,739
- Stop it now. - Let this go.

45
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,169
Don't mess with Sa Ra.

46
00:03:27,169 --> 00:03:29,839
Let it go. Aren't you letting this go?

47
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,449
Don't worry and leave.

48
00:03:36,919 --> 00:03:39,150
There'll be no such thing as remarriage.

49
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:41,560
- Mother. - Go back...

50
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,189
and tell her to stop being greedy to take over my house.

51
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,460
You should also...

52
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,729
keep an eye on your son.

53
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,030
So that he doesn't attempt to seduce Sa Ra.

54
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:05,079
Leave now.

55
00:04:15,019 --> 00:04:18,060
Did you come to our office that day?

56
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,629
I saw you.

57
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:24,330
On the day Sa Ra's mother passed away.

58
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,669
Is it weird for a lawyer to visit the prosecutor's office?

59
00:04:31,369 --> 00:04:33,269
You're trying to remarry her...

60
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,939
to hide the fact that you met her mom there.

61
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,410
It's impossible not to have a reasonable doubt.

62
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:41,979
Your imagination is immoral.

63
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:43,780
Oh, immoral?

64
00:04:44,689 --> 00:04:46,890
I think you're very capable of it.

65
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:52,789
Wait. Hey.

66
00:04:54,059 --> 00:04:56,960
Why are you so worked up?

67
00:04:57,460 --> 00:04:59,330
Is there any good news that I'm not aware of?

68
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,210
Sa Ra.

69
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,820
Let's sit and talk.

70
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,260
Aren't you leaving?

71
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:41,178
I'm getting nervous.

72
00:05:41,179 --> 00:05:42,210
Sa Ra,

73
00:05:43,609 --> 00:05:46,080
what do you want to tell me? What brought you here?

74
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:50,150
Let's do this. Remarriage.

75
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,220
Good.

76
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:59,559
It is typical of you. You're straightforward.

77
00:06:01,999 --> 00:06:03,030
But why?

78
00:06:04,869 --> 00:06:07,570
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

79
00:06:08,539 --> 00:06:11,100
You treated me like an irredeemable troublemaker.

80
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,350
I decided to only think of Seo Yun.

81
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:26,619
Will I have Kim Young A on my side?

82
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,759
I'll do my best.

83
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,188
Anyone can do their best.

84
00:06:32,189 --> 00:06:33,929
We're professionals. You should prove it.

85
00:06:39,970 --> 00:06:40,970
Never mind, then.

86
00:06:41,299 --> 00:06:43,469
Let me meet Kim Young A.

87
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,640
Then, I'll trust you.

88
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:27,239
I'm afraid that if I feel sorry, I will stop doing this.

89
00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:31,010
I'm sorry...

90
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,010
that I can't even apologize.

91
00:09:08,249 --> 00:09:12,290
(Divorce Specialist SOLUTION)

92
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:16,159
You said you had something to say, but what is this nonsense?

93
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,129
Are you resigning?

94
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:22,359
No, only for two months.

95
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:24,560
I need a vacation.

96
00:09:25,229 --> 00:09:27,070
So why?

97
00:09:27,369 --> 00:09:29,300
Are you burnt out?

98
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:33,970
Actually,

99
00:09:37,979 --> 00:09:39,509
I'm remarrying...

100
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:43,249
Noh Yul Seong.

101
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,720
- Ms. Kim. - Ms. Kim.

102
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,358
What's gotten into you? Are you sick?

103
00:09:49,359 --> 00:09:50,690
This isn't right.

104
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:56,429
I'm creating a solution for myself this time.

105
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,129
The solution code is Kim Sa Ra.

106
00:09:58,529 --> 00:10:00,268
Gosh, I disagree.

107
00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:02,670
We should follow the majority decision.

108
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,569
Wait. Where is Lawyer Dong?

109
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:05,970
Call him first.

110
00:10:06,909 --> 00:10:09,340
I already told him.

111
00:10:09,979 --> 00:10:12,450
How can you do this if you aren't insane?

112
00:10:12,550 --> 00:10:13,609
No pain, no gain.

113
00:10:13,950 --> 00:10:16,018
Everyone says you can't achieve it without going crazy.

114
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:19,589
That doesn't mean you should go this crazy.

115
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:22,060
I'm full of dopamine now.

116
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:24,460
So please support me.

117
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,029
This is not a solution. It's a suicide bomb.

118
00:10:29,859 --> 00:10:32,269
Let me listen first. What's your plan?

119
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:36,499
It's a grand fraud show for Chayul Law Firm.

120
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:40,210
First, I need to make Noh Yul Seong to trust me.

121
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:44,949
He must trust me unequivocally...

122
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:47,909
so that he won't have any suspicion of me having something up my sleeve.

123
00:10:51,749 --> 00:10:53,320
It's quite surprising.

124
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,159
You managed to make plans with Kim Young A willingly.

125
00:10:57,590 --> 00:11:00,389
Not willingly, but barely.

126
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:04,159
Did you tell her our situation? What did she say?

127
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,570
Ask her yourself.

128
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:08,970
She's here.

129
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,710
Ms. Kim!

130
00:11:13,269 --> 00:11:14,769
Thank you for coming.

131
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:21,619
I need to congratulate you first.

132
00:11:24,019 --> 00:11:26,320
Your remarriage.

133
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:32,930
Did you hear that I disagreed a lot with her decision?

134
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:36,830
Did you?

135
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:40,269
Didn't you know that I dislike you?

136
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,899
I'm ashamed.

137
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,210
But I still came here. That must tell...

138
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:50,139
how hard I'm working to recruit Sa Ra.

139
00:11:55,879 --> 00:12:00,019
Anyway, let's talk about the Law School Act next time.

140
00:12:00,619 --> 00:12:03,090
We should have a congratulatory party today.

141
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:04,259
Of course.

142
00:12:04,619 --> 00:12:07,629
Let me fill your glass, ma'am.

143
00:12:15,739 --> 00:12:16,999
Where are they?

144
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:18,970
On the second floor.

145
00:12:19,769 --> 00:12:20,869
Chairwoman Cha.

146
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:22,710
Chairwoman Cha.

147
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,149
Inside, there is...

148
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:27,810
What are you...

149
00:12:33,649 --> 00:12:34,690
Oh, you're here.

150
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,759
Please say hello. She's my mother.

151
00:12:39,029 --> 00:12:40,229
Hello.

152
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:45,329
I'm sorry. I came to the wrong room.

153
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:49,340
I came to earn a favour from Sa Ra.

154
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:54,170
We'll invite you somewhere nicer next time.

155
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,139
- Please enjoy. - Thank you.

156
00:13:05,249 --> 00:13:06,249
- Cheers. - Cheers.

157
00:13:22,999 --> 00:13:25,540
I enjoyed tonight.

158
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:26,940
I hope you'll get home safely.

159
00:13:38,389 --> 00:13:39,749
What should we do?

160
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:43,018
Shall we reserve a hotel and arrange our wedding?

161
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:44,090
Forget that, and just sign the papers.

162
00:13:52,269 --> 00:13:54,369
(Remarriage Contract)

163
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:56,869
What's this?

164
00:13:57,639 --> 00:13:58,769
A remarriage contract?

165
00:14:00,409 --> 00:14:02,340
You're cute.

166
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:06,879
We need to officially register our marriage. Okay.

167
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,749
Kim Sa Ra is responsible for childcare. Okay.

168
00:14:11,479 --> 00:14:13,618
Three million dollars for alimony in case of divorce? This is absurd.

169
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:15,420
I can't be kicked out empty-handed again.

170
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,060
- One million dollars. - Forget it.

171
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,690
Two million dollars.

172
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:21,028
But it's under the condition of you...

173
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:22,930
cooperating in the Chayul Town plan.

174
00:14:26,529 --> 00:14:27,629
Sign it and send it over.

175
00:14:28,769 --> 00:14:29,840
Okay.

176
00:14:32,239 --> 00:14:33,310
I'll get going.

177
00:14:46,749 --> 00:14:48,090
Search and seizure?

178
00:14:48,149 --> 00:14:50,560
Lawyer Dong!

179
00:15:00,129 --> 00:15:01,570
(Search and Seizure Warrant)

180
00:15:03,239 --> 00:15:05,309
Kim Sa Ra, you have been reported...

181
00:15:05,310 --> 00:15:06,939
for violating the Attorney Law Act by handling legal affairs...

182
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,238
and referring a lawyer, despite not being a lawyer.

183
00:15:09,239 --> 00:15:10,239
Let's get started.

184
00:15:10,779 --> 00:15:12,210
- Passing through. - Passing through.

185
00:15:14,249 --> 00:15:15,949
What about Lawyer Dong Gi Jun?

186
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:19,050
There is suspicion that he shared profits with you.

187
00:15:19,149 --> 00:15:21,790
You know that is subjected to criminal penalties, right?

188
00:15:22,460 --> 00:15:23,659
Let's start from that side.

189
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:44,439
Is this because you conducted the consultation?

190
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:48,279
Legal consultation is only allowed when one has a lawyer's license.

191
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:51,819
Since I always accompanied you, that's okay.

192
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,619
How about the accounting part?

193
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,019
It's clean.

194
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:57,159
If they issued a search and seizure warrant,

195
00:15:57,259 --> 00:15:59,229
it means the police have something.

196
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,460
What could it be?

197
00:16:03,229 --> 00:16:05,800
So why were you so greedy?

198
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,569
Did you report us to the police?

199
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:12,710
Do you understand what will happen when you try taking Chayul Law Firm?

200
00:16:12,909 --> 00:16:14,470
Are you blackmailing us?

201
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:19,680
I heard you two had something, so I thought you would intervene.

202
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:21,608
But I'm very disappointed, Lawyer Dong.

203
00:16:21,609 --> 00:16:22,680
Please stop.

204
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,018
Stop what you're doing for everyone.

205
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:29,190
Then, I'll resolve this situation.

206
00:16:46,109 --> 00:16:47,609
Let's clean up.

207
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:02,190
Gosh. How long has it been since our last date?

208
00:17:06,629 --> 00:17:08,859
I feel butterflies in my stomach, which I find funny.

209
00:17:12,270 --> 00:17:13,399
Stop right now.

210
00:17:16,439 --> 00:17:17,500
Stop what?

211
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,240
Chayul Law Firm is working...

212
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:23,510
to suspend Lawyer Dong's lawyer's license.

213
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,310
- It's not me. - Convince her.

214
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,250
Or else, there's no remarriage.

215
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:36,559
Are you trying to cancel our remarriage...

216
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,219
because of Lawyer Dong?

217
00:17:41,659 --> 00:17:45,030
My co-workers in SOLUTION are against our remarriage.

218
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:49,270
Everyone is trying to convince me to stop,

219
00:17:50,969 --> 00:17:52,040
and honestly, it's exhausting.

220
00:17:55,709 --> 00:17:58,480
There's no need to increase hostility in the midst of this.

221
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:02,080
I want to restart with support.

222
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,990
You're the only one who can make that possible.

223
00:18:18,699 --> 00:18:19,699
Ms. Kim!

224
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,209
There's a fake account on the seizure list of our office.

225
00:18:26,609 --> 00:18:28,269
What do you mean by fake account?

226
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,810
We never had such a thing.

227
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,908
Someone left it in the office.

228
00:18:34,909 --> 00:18:36,679
I'll search for the CCTV records.

229
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,020
Ms. Kim, you need to see this.

230
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:49,959
The main board for the CCTV is gone.

231
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:52,029
They didn't delete the footage, but just took the whole thing?

232
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,129
They know...

233
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:56,770
that we have someone to recover the deleted data.

234
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:10,750
Why was the search and seizure only done on the first floor?

235
00:19:12,219 --> 00:19:13,350
Don't you think it's weird?

236
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,188
What are you talking about?

237
00:19:16,189 --> 00:19:18,159
I'm searching the second floor myself.

238
00:19:19,359 --> 00:19:21,688
Wait! Whose permission do you have?

239
00:19:21,689 --> 00:19:22,760
Mine.

240
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,109
Let it go.

241
00:19:43,619 --> 00:19:47,250
Why do spies always leave something behind?

242
00:19:47,389 --> 00:19:50,859
Is it because they're anxious about how they will be used?

243
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:53,559
We will file charges for trade secret infringement...

244
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,629
and obstruction of business. Be prepared to face legal action.

245
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:03,169
I salute your capability.

246
00:20:07,139 --> 00:20:11,809
But Yul Seong and you don't match well.

247
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:12,850
You know that, right?

248
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,649
Were you his girlfriend?

249
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:19,020
Why? Did the chairwoman say she'd accept you?

250
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:22,159
Well, it depends on how well I do.

251
00:20:22,719 --> 00:20:24,359
(Cashbook)

252
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:30,530
Why are you giving me this mission?

253
00:20:31,399 --> 00:20:32,969
If you're not confident, don't.

254
00:20:33,929 --> 00:20:37,469
Could I also have an opportunity if I do well?

255
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:40,340
Does this mean that?

256
00:20:42,439 --> 00:20:44,480
It depends on what you think.

257
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:49,679
You're not obsessed...

258
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:51,250
with Mr. Noh, are you?

259
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,590
You go ahead and be obsessed all you want.

260
00:20:54,619 --> 00:20:55,619
Get out.

261
00:21:14,869 --> 00:21:17,010
Manager Jang was the culprit?

262
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,379
We won't need to worry about the police.

263
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,080
Are you sure you want to go to that house despite all this?

264
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:31,590
Reconsider one last time.

265
00:21:35,459 --> 00:21:36,659
Don't become...

266
00:21:38,929 --> 00:21:39,969
Noh Yul Seong's wife again.

267
00:21:47,869 --> 00:21:49,040
We've always...

268
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:52,879
quarrelled over the solution methods.

269
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:55,050
Right?

270
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,820
Right. Well, if that's the case,

271
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,359
I'll leave SOLUTION.

272
00:22:07,459 --> 00:22:10,100
Won't your husband be bothered if we work together?

273
00:22:13,199 --> 00:22:15,129
Aren't you the one feeling bothered?

274
00:22:17,270 --> 00:22:20,109
You know that, and you're using this as a solution?

275
00:22:25,179 --> 00:22:27,080
I just don't get it.

276
00:22:28,609 --> 00:22:30,020
I won't be able to congratulate you...

277
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,590
or root for you.

278
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:35,919
I'm off.

279
00:22:54,209 --> 00:22:55,439
Are you really going to be like this?

280
00:22:56,879 --> 00:22:58,379
Where are you going without us?

281
00:22:59,379 --> 00:23:00,449
Ms. Kim.

282
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:06,790
I can't agree with a solution that hurts and damages...

283
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:08,990
the client.

284
00:23:10,459 --> 00:23:11,919
Whether it be body, soul,

285
00:23:14,859 --> 00:23:17,459
and even promises. Anything.

286
00:23:19,869 --> 00:23:20,969
I'll see you again.

287
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:23,869
Lawyer Dong.

288
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:41,050
As you have asked, we have prepared a separate room.

289
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,580
Thank you, Ms. Lee.

290
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,929
Hello, Chairwoman Cha.

291
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,510
Why is she standing before me?

292
00:25:13,409 --> 00:25:15,510
Who let her in my house?

293
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:17,648
I told you.

294
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:19,649
She will be living with us starting today.

295
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:23,490
What's this?

296
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:25,520
Mr. Noh sent this to me today.

297
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:27,659
That is why I moved in.

298
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,168

00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:46,080
You sign this piece of trash and call yourself a lawyer?

304
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:47,580
An alimony?

305
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:51,050
Just think of it as funds for lobbying.

306
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,020
That will make life easier.

307
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:57,490
I will head to my room.

308
00:26:28,619 --> 00:26:31,689
Wait just a little longer, Mom.

309
00:26:41,899 --> 00:26:44,369
Whenever you miss your mom, dial number one...

310
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:46,040

I won't have you at the same table.

338
00:28:53,669 --> 00:28:55,730
It will be hard to set the table twice, Chairwoman Cha.

339

I feel like I'm finally breathing...

346
00:29:23,199 --> 00:29:24,629
because I can be with Seo Yun.

347
00:29:26,669 --> 00:29:28,300
So that's the only reason you came back?

348
00:29:29,969 --> 00:29:31,439
Then you two should share the same room.

349
00:29:31,899 --> 00:29:32,939
Then I will trust you.

Yes, ma'am.

00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:48,149
But Chairwoman Cha, why did you ask me to do it?

367
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:50,520
You wanted to be treated like a daughter-in-law.

368

That's not it. You're doing this on purpose to get a hold on me.

380
00:31:31,219 --> 00:31:33,689
Chairwoman Cha is someone who finds people suspicious all the time.

381

00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:44,500
So you're coming back to SOLUTION, right?

545
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,969
I'll need to think about that.

546
00:42:50,869 --> 00:42:55,069
I just thought of a way to get Gong Deukgu to speak up.

547
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:03,449
If you agree to come back to SOLUTION, I'll tell you.

548
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:22,170
Hello.

549
00:43:23,299 --> 00:43:25,469
I got curious about something again.

550
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:27,469
Yes?

551
00:43:28,569 --> 00:43:32,940
Could you tell me where you were on October 31...

552
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:35,250
last year?

553
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:40,549
October 31...

554
00:43:42,049 --> 00:43:43,860
Gosh. I can't seem to remember that day.

555
00:43:55,330 --> 00:43:56,330
This man...

556
00:43:58,170 --> 00:44:00,369
Isn't this you in the photo?

557
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:05,239
I don't think so.

558
00:44:08,279 --> 00:44:09,710
Please take a closer look.

559
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:12,350
I was quite surprised because you looked so much like him.

560
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:16,790
That's not me.

561
00:44:21,929 --> 00:44:23,060
I see.

562
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:28,929
I'm looking for the guy in the picture.

563
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:30,770
I see.

564
00:44:30,771 --> 00:44:32,670
I want to hear about my mother's last moment...

565
00:44:33,909 --> 00:44:35,009
before she died.

566
00:44:36,409 --> 00:44:37,480
I see.

567
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:43,779
I'm sorry I asked such questions.

568
00:44:47,889 --> 00:44:49,650
Then I'll get going now.

569
00:45:08,069 --> 00:45:10,279
- What did he say? - He said it wasn't him.

570
00:45:11,409 --> 00:45:12,540
Are you sure you'll be okay?

571
00:45:12,909 --> 00:45:15,779
He will probably tell Noh Yul Seong or the chairwoman right away.

572
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:18,480
Well, that was the intention. That's why I showed him the photo.

573
00:45:20,819 --> 00:45:21,850
Be careful,

574
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:24,219
both physically and mentally.

575
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,659
She had security footage.

576
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,429
Your wife is suspecting me.

577
00:45:37,869 --> 00:45:40,440
My wife has been investigating her mother's case?

578
00:45:40,909 --> 00:45:41,968
I'm not sure.

579
00:45:41,969 --> 00:45:44,580
Anyway, if you give me two million dollars as I asked,

580
00:45:44,909 --> 00:45:46,080
I'll leave Korea.

581
00:45:48,810 --> 00:45:49,810
Hey.

582
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:51,579
Do I owe you any money?

583
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:53,080
I kept my silence this time again.

584
00:45:53,449 --> 00:45:55,489
I kept it a secret to the chairwoman all this time too.

585
00:45:58,020 --> 00:45:59,420
Do you have the brain of a goldfish?

586
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:01,729
You're the one in the evidence video...

587
00:46:01,730 --> 00:46:03,259
with my late mother-in-law on the day she died.

588
00:46:03,489 --> 00:46:05,658
You know what? The moment you talk,

589
00:46:05,659 --> 00:46:07,798
you'll be admitting your own crime.

590
00:46:07,799 --> 00:46:08,869
Don't you get it?

591
00:46:10,739 --> 00:46:11,770
Just leave.

592
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:14,069
I'll call you when I'm ready.

593
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:26,449
That idiot.

594
00:46:30,719 --> 00:46:32,460
Gosh, Kim Sa Ra.

595
00:46:32,719 --> 00:46:34,429
She's been investigating this case behind my back?

596
00:46:35,690 --> 00:46:38,159
You cannot meet with the chairwoman as her schedule won't allow it.

597
00:46:39,799 --> 00:46:40,799
Gosh. Come on.

598
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:43,170
What brings you here?

599
00:46:45,569 --> 00:46:47,339
Did you already get back together with Ms. Kim?

600
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:48,540
Are you here to congratulate me?

601
00:46:48,541 --> 00:46:50,069
The police want me to come in for questioning.

602
00:46:50,279 --> 00:46:52,178
The chairwoman told me to do it. She must take responsibility.

603
00:46:52,179 --> 00:46:53,909
Is there proof that she made you do it?

604
00:46:56,210 --> 00:46:58,879
You know what? Next time, date a man...

605
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,420
who tells you that you are enough and is happy with you. Okay?

606
00:47:02,619 --> 00:47:03,690
Know your place. Got it?

607
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:22,710
Let's get that one.

608
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:25,040
You're home.

609
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:26,480
Yes.

610
00:47:28,549 --> 00:47:30,380
Gosh. Really?

611
00:47:35,750 --> 00:47:37,259
Mom. Look at this.

612
00:48:22,429 --> 00:48:23,799
You startled me. Goodness.

613
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:31,979
There's a guy named Gong Deukgu, working for the company.

614
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:33,440
The team leader of transportation.

615
00:48:35,310 --> 00:48:36,350
Yes.

616
00:48:38,049 --> 00:48:39,119
Can you take a look at this?

617
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:43,488
This is the security footage from the prosecutors' office...

618
00:48:43,489 --> 00:48:44,989
on the day of my mom's death.

619
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:46,860
I didn't know my mom went there.

620
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:49,989
Really?

621
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,000
But why?

622
00:48:53,330 --> 00:48:54,400
I don't know.

623
00:48:55,199 --> 00:48:59,000
But look at the man next to my mom. Doesn't he look like Mr. Gong?

624
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:06,310
I'm not sure. I can't really tell.

625
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:09,610
But how did you get this video?

626
00:49:12,819 --> 00:49:15,619
Lawyer Dong. He asked me if this was my mom.

627
00:49:16,150 --> 00:49:19,819
Gosh. Come on. Are you still in touch with him?

628
00:49:20,259 --> 00:49:22,189
I kept thinking about it, but it didn't make any sense.

629
00:49:22,190 --> 00:49:23,830
So I asked Mr. Gong.

630
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:26,900
But he said it wasn't him.

631
00:49:28,299 --> 00:49:29,400
Then it wasn't him.

632
00:49:29,869 --> 00:49:31,199
Maybe, you're too sensitive.

633
00:49:34,670 --> 00:49:35,739
Am I?

634
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:39,509
Come out, and have your meal.

635
00:50:02,569 --> 00:50:04,770
I ran out of sleeping pills in my room. Get some more.

636
00:50:10,909 --> 00:50:12,980
Is something making you anxious?

637
00:50:13,949 --> 00:50:15,679
That's when people usually get insomnia.

638
00:50:16,110 --> 00:50:17,179
How could I sleep?

639
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:20,219
When I have you in my house.

640
00:50:21,049 --> 00:50:24,520
Right. This is what I heard. If people don't get...

641
00:50:25,589 --> 00:50:28,258
at least 7 hours of sleep starting at the age of 50,

642
00:50:28,259 --> 00:50:30,259
their chances of getting dementia will increase.

643
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:33,259
You should keep that in mind.

644
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:47,139
(Lee Jae Hyuk)

645
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:49,580
- Hello? - We did it.

646
00:50:49,581 --> 00:50:50,980
They passed the law regarding law schools.

647
00:50:53,819 --> 00:50:55,588
- Is the plenary session over? - Yes.

648
00:50:55,589 --> 00:50:57,988
It's been decided that there will be three more law schools.

649
00:50:57,989 --> 00:50:59,189
If we get to build 1 of the 3 schools,

650
00:50:59,190 --> 00:51:00,389
we'll be golden.

651
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:05,329
Good work. I mean it.

652
00:51:05,330 --> 00:51:07,770
I'll come out. Let's grab a drink.

653
00:51:23,779 --> 00:51:24,819
It was passed.

654
00:51:26,549 --> 00:51:27,889
Good work.

655
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:34,759
Good work, honey. I mean it.

656
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:36,929
I told you, didn't I?

657
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:38,600
She definitely helped us out this time.

658
00:51:41,299 --> 00:51:43,230
Congratulations, ma'am.

659
00:51:46,270 --> 00:51:48,310
Do you honestly believe that your contribution was critical?

660
00:51:49,639 --> 00:51:51,479
Besides, has it been decided that we'll build one of the law schools?

661
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:53,408
Gosh, Mom. Why do you have to spoil the mood on a day like today?

662
00:51:53,409 --> 00:51:55,210
It's not the time to give each other an attaboy and an attagirl.

663
00:52:11,259 --> 00:52:12,860
I have you to thank, Ms. Kim.

664
00:52:13,330 --> 00:52:14,999
Thank you for your effort.

665
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,329
I didn't do much.

666
00:52:16,330 --> 00:52:18,400
I told you that this would happen anyway.

667
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:19,670
Right.

668
00:52:21,110 --> 00:52:25,239
Are you casting me for a role in your grand scheme of deception...

669
00:52:25,639 --> 00:52:26,779
you're putting together?

670
00:52:28,949 --> 00:52:30,448
To put it simply, yes.

671
00:52:30,449 --> 00:52:31,480
(The generation-changing Hanjoo Party of the nation)

672
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:36,420
The law regarding the law schools will get passed anyway.

673
00:52:36,889 --> 00:52:39,889
- Really? - Personally, I'm for it.

674
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:43,258
But I'm working on it behind the scenes for now.

675
00:52:43,259 --> 00:52:45,399
How come you said you were neutral about the law?

676
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:46,629
If I didn't say so,

677
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:48,299
many opportunists would have pestered me.

678
00:52:51,270 --> 00:52:54,210
You know, we have our own scenario too.

679
00:52:54,610 --> 00:52:56,110
SOLUTION isn't the only one with it.

680
00:52:57,069 --> 00:52:59,508
Is it safe to say that I returned the favour?

681
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:01,009
For helping me keep my children.

682
00:53:02,449 --> 00:53:03,948
You've done more than enough.

683
00:53:03,949 --> 00:53:06,048
But I will take a neutral stance...

684
00:53:06,049 --> 00:53:08,150
when it comes to deciding who gets to build the law schools.

685
00:53:09,589 --> 00:53:10,619
Yes.

686
00:53:11,190 --> 00:53:14,389
My show must come to an end before that decision is due.

687
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:18,000
So Chayul Law Firm naturally gets eliminated from the list.

688
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:22,529
Yes. Bye.

689
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:35,210
Wasn't it obvious?

690
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:37,919
There was a lot of news coverage on the law school monopoly...

691
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:39,548
starting a few days ago. The tide had turned.

692
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:41,088
That's how the law got passed.

693
00:53:41,089 --> 00:53:42,189
Sa Ra had nothing to do with it.

694
00:53:42,190 --> 00:53:44,258
But still. The final selection still remains.

695
00:53:44,259 --> 00:53:46,360
It'll be helpful to have her on our side until then.

696
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:48,460
Anyway, you're such an idiot.

697
00:53:48,690 --> 00:53:50,830
I told you many times not to trust anyone.

698
00:53:51,259 --> 00:53:52,759
This is why you will never succeed.

699
00:53:59,369 --> 00:54:01,839
Then what about you? Why do you trust Gong Deukgu?

700
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:05,739
You...

701
00:54:07,409 --> 00:54:08,650
Did you think I didn't know?

702
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:14,719
- How much of it do you know? - I know everything.

703
00:54:15,790 --> 00:54:19,159
Do you honestly believe that he worked only for you?

704
00:54:21,429 --> 00:54:24,230
You tell me that I'm an idiot and this is why I can't succeed.

705
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:25,798
Now, you must stop telling me that.

706
00:54:25,799 --> 00:54:27,429
You don't have the right to tell me that.

707
00:54:28,270 --> 00:54:30,899
- Where are you going? - To meet with my investors.

708
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:32,068
Today is a good day...

709
00:54:32,069 --> 00:54:33,739
although you totally ruined it.

710
00:54:37,710 --> 00:54:39,580
That jerk, Gong Deukgu.

711
00:55:05,069 --> 00:55:06,670
He drank a lot as today is a good day.

712
00:55:07,369 --> 00:55:09,940
I'll take it from here. You can leave now.

713
00:55:10,839 --> 00:55:11,940
Okay.

714
00:55:12,779 --> 00:55:13,810
Gosh.

(Kim Sa Ra)

722
00:56:52,009 --> 00:56:53,009
Yes, it's me.

723
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:56,080
I need you to get ready next Monday.

724
00:56:56,549 --> 00:56:58,719
Is it what you expected? Is there something happening?

725
00:56:59,549 --> 00:57:00,920
That's probably D-Day.

726
00:57:01,589 --> 00:57:02,650
Okay.

727
00:57:03,819 --> 00:57:06,659
I mean... How were you able to predict this?

728
00:57:08,460 --> 00:57:10,229
There's only so much Noh Yul Seong and his mother...

729
00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:12,000
can possibly do once they find out that...

730
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:13,759
we are on to them.

731
00:57:17,069 --> 00:57:18,639
I guess moving in there paid off.

732
00:57:20,739 --> 00:57:21,739
Do you see it now?

733
00:57:23,139 --> 00:57:24,210
Yes, I do.

734
00:57:27,009 --> 00:57:28,879
- I'll see you that day. - Okay.

735
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:30,480
Right. Continue to be careful.

736
00:57:31,819 --> 00:57:32,850
Okay.

737
00:57:47,029 --> 00:57:48,069
Over there.

738
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,040
Let's follow him.

739
00:58:33,239 --> 00:58:35,949
We'll reach the destination in ten minutes.

740
00:58:36,949 --> 00:58:39,350
Then let's do it at the next traffic light.

741
00:58:41,949 --> 00:58:42,989
Okay.

742
00:59:03,610 --> 00:59:04,639
Hold on tight.

743
00:59:25,860 --> 00:59:27,899
Gosh. What was that?

744
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:29,028
Were you even looking ahead?

745
00:59:29,029 --> 00:59:31,238
How could you get your eyes off the road?

746
00:59:31,239 --> 00:59:32,368
Are you all right?

747
00:59:32,369 --> 00:59:34,269
Hold on. Let me check on your back. Oh, no.

748
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:36,039
- Gosh. Look at your wrists. - Oh, no.

749
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:37,908
- Let me check on your wrists. - Goodness.

750
00:59:37,909 --> 00:59:39,809
Gosh. You're going to be okay.

751
00:59:39,810 --> 00:59:41,810
You were going to Sinyeong-ro 24-Gil, correct?

752
00:59:42,949 --> 00:59:43,980
Mr. Gong Deukgu?

753
00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:46,579
Who are you guys?

754
00:59:46,580 --> 00:59:47,790
Untie me right now!

755
00:59:48,690 --> 00:59:49,690
Let's go.

756
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:52,488
- What are you doing? - Gosh. Wait.

757
00:59:52,489 --> 00:59:53,519
"Who are we?"

758
00:59:53,520 --> 00:59:54,589
Keep walking.

759
00:59:54,830 --> 00:59:56,529
We just saved your life.

760
01:00:02,170 --> 01:00:05,238
(I've arrived.)

761
01:00:05,239 --> 01:00:06,769
(Stay in the car.)

762
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:08,739
(Don't let anyone see you.)

763
01:00:20,449 --> 01:00:21,489
Watch it for yourself.

764
01:00:30,830 --> 01:00:32,860
I told you, didn't I? We just saved your life.

765
01:00:33,060 --> 01:00:35,199
Hey. How did you guys know...

766
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:40,900
What are you doing here, Ms. Kim?

767
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:44,310
Do you still not understand who's behind this?

768
01:00:47,739 --> 01:00:48,750
Noh Yul Seong.

769
01:00:49,949 --> 01:00:51,319
Why did you do that to my mother?

770
01:00:53,449 --> 01:00:56,318
Your mother's death had nothing to do with me.

771
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:57,860
You took my mother!

772
01:01:01,989 --> 01:01:03,029
That's because...

773
01:01:04,159 --> 01:01:05,560
I was told to do that.

774
01:01:05,830 --> 01:01:08,469
You were told to do that? By whom?

775
01:01:12,139 --> 01:01:13,170
That day...

776
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:15,638
Let Secretary Baek take care of the car.

777
01:01:15,639 --> 01:01:17,138
There's an old lady,

778
01:01:17,139 --> 01:01:18,639
dressed in a purple jacket in front of the desk.

779
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:20,279
Yes. There. Go to the desk already.

780
01:01:21,409 --> 01:01:22,908
I took Mr. Noh's car to the office as backup.

781
01:01:22,909 --> 01:01:24,980
- Ma'am. - Then he gave me an order.

782
01:01:26,619 --> 01:01:28,448
The prosecutor will be coming down shortly.

783
01:01:28,449 --> 01:01:30,850
- Please wait. - Okay. Thank you.

784
01:01:31,290 --> 01:01:33,988
Excuse me. Are you here to see Prosecutor Dong Gi Jun?

785
01:01:33,989 --> 01:01:36,258
- Yes. - You can follow me.

786
01:01:36,259 --> 01:01:37,790
- Is that so? - Yes.

787
01:01:42,830 --> 01:01:44,699
Gosh. Ms. Kim.

788
01:01:45,639 --> 01:01:47,399
Afterwards,

789
01:01:47,400 --> 01:01:49,339
I was told to get out of the car in the middle of the road.

790
01:01:51,779 --> 01:01:52,810
By whom?

791
01:01:59,650 --> 01:02:00,949
Mr. Noh Yul Seong.

792
01:02:11,299 --> 01:02:12,329
That's all I know.

793
01:02:12,330 --> 01:02:14,799
I don't know what happened after that.

794
01:02:15,630 --> 01:02:16,969
Then what about Na Yu Mi's case?

795
01:02:17,670 --> 01:02:18,670
You were behind it, right?

796
01:02:24,469 --> 01:02:25,779
Who made you do it?

797
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:27,480
Chairwoman Cha?

798
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:31,520
Can I...

799
01:02:33,779 --> 01:02:35,589
smoke a cigarette?

800
01:02:48,069 --> 01:02:49,100
Are you all right?

801
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,600
Noh Yul Seong was behind it.

802
01:02:58,940 --> 01:03:00,009
Hey!

803
01:03:15,259 --> 01:03:17,690
- Hey! Stop it! - Mr. Gong.

804
01:03:41,889 --> 01:03:42,949
No.

805
01:03:51,529 --> 01:03:53,699
(Queen of Divorce)

806
01:04:21,790 --> 01:04:23,230
We must change the target.

807
01:04:23,389 --> 01:04:24,999
We must corner them into the abyss of mistrust.

808
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:26,629
So they end up revealing each other's crime.

809
01:04:26,630 --> 01:04:28,730
- What we need to do is... - To make them turn on each other.

810
01:04:28,869 --> 01:04:30,129
Then at least take some weapons with you...

811
01:04:30,130 --> 01:04:31,868
because we're at war now.

812
01:04:31,869 --> 01:04:33,638
Do you still smell like food?

813
01:04:33,639 --> 01:04:35,539
Did you know that we wear the same perfume?

814
01:04:35,540 --> 01:04:37,270
You should focus on trying to get the stink off your son instead.

815
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:39,908
You were the one who tried to kill Mr. Gong...

816
01:04:39,909 --> 01:04:41,709
and gave out the order to bring Sa Ra's mother-in-law.

817
01:04:41,710 --> 01:04:43,480
I wanted to ask you that.

818
01:04:43,610 --> 01:04:45,618
Two million dollars were wired to Gong Deukgu.

819
01:04:45,619 --> 01:04:48,290
As money laundering was suspected, they're pursuing a certain law firm.

820
01:04:48,420 --> 01:04:49,949
Gong Deukgu was your driver, Mother.

821
01:04:50,989 --> 01:04:53,658
All right. Don't fight now. Why don't you go together?

822
01:04:53,659 --> 01:04:57,089
I wonder which one of you the police have come to arrest.
