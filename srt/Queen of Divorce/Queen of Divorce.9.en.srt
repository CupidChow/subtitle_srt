1
00:00:15,350 --> 00:00:18,449
(E Ji Ah)

2
00:00:18,789 --> 00:00:20,090
(Kang Ki Young)

3
00:00:25,959 --> 00:00:27,560
(Oh Min Suk)

4
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:44,139
(Queen of Divorce)

5
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:49,078
Kim Young A likes you so much.

6
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:50,120
It's not your business.

7
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:51,920
Are you joining her camp?

8
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:55,090
- Why are you curious? - Seo Yun is coming back soon.

9
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:00,560
- Can I meet him? - Of course.

10
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:03,829
But we should be a family first.

11
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,730
Let's...

12
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,169
get married again.

13
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,149
(Hanjoo Party)

14
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:25,050
- Have you gone mad? - Remember what I told you?

15
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,788
You would always be my first for everything.

16
00:01:27,789 --> 00:01:29,520
Be my first again, if you will.

17
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,229
I even hate the idea of being the last woman for you.

18
00:01:32,929 --> 00:01:34,130
Then think only about Seo Yun.

19
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,668
Imagine how badly Seo Yun must want to live with his mother.

20
00:01:37,669 --> 00:01:40,940
You're not asking me for his sake. It's because of Ms. Kim Young A.

21
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:42,539
What's so bad about that?

22
00:01:44,169 --> 00:01:45,868
Just think about winning her over to our side...

23
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:47,879
and building Chayul Town.

24
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,808
Seo Yun's life will be on a whole new level.

25
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:53,149
His life will be more than just comfortable.

26
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,550
Nothing will ever stop him.

27
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:57,549
Stop using him to get your way.

28
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:59,089
Gosh. You're driving me crazy.

29
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:01,559
How could you be angry about this?

30
00:02:03,059 --> 00:02:04,859
You'll be happy because you'll have Seo Yun in your life.

31
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,428
I'll be happy because I'll have connections to Ms. Kim Young A.

32
00:02:06,429 --> 00:02:08,029
Then Seo Yun will be happy to have his mother in his life.

33
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,759
This will be a huge win for everyone.

34
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,329
Can't you put two and two together?

35
00:02:11,330 --> 00:02:14,569
No, you're wrong. It will be a huge win for a greedy rat.

36
00:02:21,539 --> 00:02:22,680
Gosh. Come on.

37
00:02:31,049 --> 00:02:32,090
Seo Yun.

38
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:34,690
- It's me. - Hi, Mom.

39
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:36,819
Did you have a nice day at school?

40
00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:39,258
You'll go on a school break soon.

41
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:41,799
Yes. That's why I'm coming to Seoul next month.

42
00:02:42,359 --> 00:02:44,900
When I come back, will I be able to see you?

43
00:02:45,829 --> 00:02:48,069
Of course. We'll definitely meet.

44
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,939
I'll make sure of that.

45
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:52,210
Okay. I miss you so much, Mom.

46
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:59,810
Seo Yun. I'm sorry that we're apart, so you ended up missing me.

47
00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:05,120
I'll call you again.

48
00:03:05,789 --> 00:03:07,989
- I love you. - I love you too.

49
00:03:22,539 --> 00:03:24,509
Gosh. That's a load of nonsense!

50
00:03:25,009 --> 00:03:26,710
Hey, this is absurd!

51
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:29,978
Sa Ra. Should I go out and buy you a doll?

52
00:03:29,979 --> 00:03:32,780
We can put it up here and stab it with a bamboo needle. Yes?

53
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:44,960
What's up with that gaze of yours?

54
00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:47,630
Don't tell me you're considering it.

55
00:03:48,359 --> 00:03:49,729
No, right?

56
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:57,639
Is it because of your son?

57
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,210
Come on, Sa Ra.

58
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:12,650
Whenever I think about Seo Yun,

59
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,430
I feel like an awful mother who only cares about herself.

60
00:04:23,629 --> 00:04:25,399
Then I feel like a crazy woman...

61
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,169
for getting tempted by his offer like this.

62
00:04:29,499 --> 00:04:31,109
Seriously. I'm such a mess.

63
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,080
Hey.

64
00:04:45,289 --> 00:04:47,249
(Episode 9)

65
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,869
Okay. Tell him not to be late.

66
00:05:00,929 --> 00:05:01,939
Mom, I'm going into a meeting.

67
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:06,239
It's not just a regular date. It's a blind date for marriage?

68
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:08,410
Aren't you a bit too young to think about marriage?

69
00:05:11,809 --> 00:05:14,580
Well, my mom kept pestering me about these dates.

70
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:18,450
I envy you...

71
00:05:19,989 --> 00:05:21,320
that you have a pestering mom.

72
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,559
Ms. Kim Sa Ra?

73
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,329
Yes.

74
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:28,160
Sir, I got it. I'll give it to her.

75
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:29,629
Okay.

76
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:31,299
- Thank you. - Have a good day.

77
00:05:35,239 --> 00:05:36,868
Is there a special occasion?

78
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:39,739
No. But even if there was a special occasion,

79
00:05:40,109 --> 00:05:41,910
who would send me stuff like that?

80
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:43,910
What is it?

81
00:05:54,789 --> 00:05:55,820
How beautiful.

82
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,859
(From Noh Yul Seong)

83
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:11,209
Gosh. That was random.

84
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:14,410
Wait. Is something going on with you and Mr. Noh Yul Seong?

85
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,080
No.

86
00:06:17,609 --> 00:06:19,510
- Return this. - Yes, ma'am.

87
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,249
No. I'll do it.

88
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,619
(Mom)

89
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,260
Hello?

90
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,929
Who is this?

91
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:16,369
I see. I'm sorry.

92
00:07:19,669 --> 00:07:21,410
Oh, right. You can make a phone call first.

93
00:07:22,179 --> 00:07:23,640
No. I can't do it anyway.

94
00:07:24,749 --> 00:07:25,850
I was calling Mom.

95
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:27,748
I see.

96
00:07:27,749 --> 00:07:29,850
The machine always said the number didn't exist.

97
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,619
But someone has taken her number already.

98
00:07:32,689 --> 00:07:35,589
I used to make a lot of those calls to my parents too...

99
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:36,989
when my parents passed away.

100
00:07:41,129 --> 00:07:42,830
Well, are you all right?

101
00:07:44,429 --> 00:07:45,470
Yes.

102
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:55,479
What is it?

103
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:59,309
It's fine as long as you're all right.

104
00:08:06,489 --> 00:08:09,189
Well, you know, these flowers...

105
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,559
What do they mean?

106
00:08:21,739 --> 00:08:22,770
Well,

107
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:29,080
this must be a delivery mistake.

108
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:35,150
I see. Okay. Have a good day.

109
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,519
Thanks.

110
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,330
Did you want to see me?

111
00:08:52,499 --> 00:08:54,969
Did you think this kind of move would work on her?

112
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:55,999
(Please tell your son not to send me his dirty flowers.)

113
00:09:03,739 --> 00:09:07,508
Please tell your son not to send me his dirty flowers.

114
00:09:07,509 --> 00:09:08,550
From Kim Sa Ra.

115
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:11,748
Gosh. This is embarrassing.

116
00:09:11,749 --> 00:09:14,420
Are you naive or foolish?

117
00:09:14,790 --> 00:09:17,518
You're the perfect prey for that audacious witch.

118
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:18,560
Mom.

119
00:09:21,129 --> 00:09:22,959
Is there anything more important to us than getting the law...

120
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,460
passed about law schools to build Chayul Town?

121
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,840
(Successful Strategy for Law School Law and Chayul Town)

122
00:09:33,909 --> 00:09:35,409
(Current Status)

123
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:38,779
(Expected votes with Kim Young A's support)

124
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:41,778
The person Kim Young A trusts and wants the most...

125
00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:42,820
is Kim Sa Ra.

126
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,488
Why do you want to use Kim Sa Ra to get Kim Young A's support?

127
00:09:45,489 --> 00:09:47,690
You must get her on board by finding dirt on her to put pressure.

128
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,858
I tried to take that path, but it didn't work.

129
00:09:49,859 --> 00:09:51,289
Then I must take a different path.

130
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,759
And that path is Kim Sa Ra?

131
00:09:54,389 --> 00:09:57,100
You know what? Don't even try to do anything. I'll get it done.

132
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,399
Do you think I'm doing this just to get her support?

133
00:10:00,729 --> 00:10:02,739
Kim Sa Ra and Dong Gi Jun. These two...

134
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,139
started to investigate Na Yu Mi's case again.

135
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:14,409
That's good.

136
00:10:14,749 --> 00:10:18,649
You don't have anything to do with Na Yu Mi's case anyway.

137
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:20,720
This is good?

138
00:10:23,619 --> 00:10:24,960
Do you truly mean that?

139
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,060
What are you getting at?

140
00:10:30,499 --> 00:10:33,469
Anyway, I'm the one who started the Chayul Town project.

141
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:34,800
So I'll see it through.

142
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,869
Let me handle it.

143
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,819
Hey, as for the things I told you to prepare for today,

144
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:50,978
bring the most luxurious and expensive ones.

145
00:10:50,979 --> 00:10:52,119
They must dazzle her.

146
00:10:52,649 --> 00:10:53,720
Yes, sir.

147
00:11:02,499 --> 00:11:05,129
Bom. What are all these?

148
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,899
They're for the first memorial service for Ms. Kim's mother.

149
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,739
She said she was going to do it alone.

150
00:11:10,999 --> 00:11:13,340
Wait. You're going to load them into the car, right?

151
00:11:16,779 --> 00:11:18,710
Gosh. Lawyer Dong.

152
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,979
- What brings you here? - I'm coming in.

153
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,190
Where should I put this box?

154
00:11:27,450 --> 00:11:29,720
That box? Put it on the chair.

155
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:31,790
Thank you.

156
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:37,800
Lawyer Dong said he had 15 years of holding memorial services.

157
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,039
Oh, right. That's the path her mother would enter from.

158
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,109
We must leave the door open.

159
00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:46,639
I doubt that she knows the passcode.

160
00:11:47,509 --> 00:11:48,540
I see.

161
00:11:53,779 --> 00:11:54,810
First of all...

162
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,050
Red food goes on the east side, and white food, on the west side.

163
00:11:57,649 --> 00:11:59,488
What about the order of dates, chestnuts, pears, and persimmons?

164
00:11:59,489 --> 00:12:00,649
(Table setting for memorial service)

165
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:02,758
What? The order?

166
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:04,159
What was the order?

167
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,389
Are you taking an exam on the table setting?

168
00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:11,869
When I do something, I tend to do my best.

169
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,469
As for the placement of the food...

170
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:14,599
and the order of the nuts and fruits,

171
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,839
they aren't even recorded in documents.

172
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,470
What was your mother's favorite food?

173
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,138
It was mung bean jeon.

174
00:12:20,139 --> 00:12:21,170
Give me that then.

175
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,409
Here.

176
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,479
- All right. - What else?

177
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,220
After that,

178
00:12:31,989 --> 00:12:34,350
- give me the seasoned vegetables. - The seasoned vegetables.

179
00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:36,089
The seasoned vegetables.

180
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,489
Put the vegetables on the ceremonial plate.

181
00:12:42,499 --> 00:12:43,728
When you're able to free up your mind,

182
00:12:43,729 --> 00:12:44,970
come back whenever you want.

183
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:47,200
I'll be right here.

184
00:12:52,009 --> 00:12:53,009
Okay.

185
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,479
Ms. Kim.

186
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,409
Let's get to work.

187
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:01,680
- What should I do? - You can get to work.

188
00:13:05,389 --> 00:13:06,989
Hurry up. Come on.

189
00:13:11,889 --> 00:13:12,889
Go on.

190
00:13:13,930 --> 00:13:15,129
You got the expensive ones, right?

191
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:17,159
Yes, sir. I bought the highest-quality ones.

192
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,570
Did Dae Gi get off work?

193
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,600
He's probably investigating Na Yu Mi's case.

194
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,470
Yes. I asked him for his help.

195
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,339
I asked him to go over Na Yu Mi's whereabouts...

196
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,979
on the day of her death from start to finish.

197
00:13:30,739 --> 00:13:32,779
If Noh Yul Seong isn't the culprit, who could it be then?

198
00:13:34,249 --> 00:13:36,749
We must find the witness, but it won't be easy.

199
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,560
Gosh. It's so heavy.

200
00:13:44,489 --> 00:13:45,489
I'm not late.

201
00:13:48,129 --> 00:13:50,259
It's your mother's memorial service today.

202
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,369
I brought something for the service too.

203
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,939
What are you doing?

204
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,199
Isn't it obvious?

205
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,868
She's Seo Yun's grandmother.

206
00:13:58,869 --> 00:14:00,570
Who's going to take care of her memorial service if not me?

207
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:03,109
Do you think my mother will want to eat the food you brought?

208
00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:05,850
Take it back as you leave.

209
00:14:07,509 --> 00:14:08,519
Sa Ra.

210
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:11,050
Can't we...

211
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,920
act like adults now?

212
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,989
Didn't you hear what she said?

213
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:21,159
- She told you to leave. - What are you doing here?

214
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,629
Can you help me? I want to throw all of them out.

215
00:14:45,889 --> 00:14:46,950
This is awkward.

216
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:48,989
Okay, fine.

217
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:52,690
I'll bring Seo Yun next time we meet.

218
00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:55,200
See you then. I'll get going now.

219
00:15:01,629 --> 00:15:02,670
Bye.

220
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,609
Bye.

221
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:23,790
The flowers and the food for the memorial service.

222
00:15:24,859 --> 00:15:25,889
What are you getting at?

223
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:28,259
Oh, you... I guess she hasn't told you yet.

224
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:32,470
Go upstairs, and hear it from her. It will be fun news.

225
00:15:40,239 --> 00:15:41,509
Let's go.

226
00:15:58,119 --> 00:15:59,529
The witness...

227
00:16:07,499 --> 00:16:09,470
What happened to the girl you mentioned before?

228
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,810
On the day of Na Yu Mi's death,

229
00:16:12,239 --> 00:16:14,170
a part-timer came into the room. Remember her?

230
00:16:14,369 --> 00:16:17,239
Oh, her. I've been watching her. She's been quiet so far.

231
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:19,978
She might not have anything to do with that.

232
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,550
Keep checking. So they don't get their hands on her.

233
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:23,850
Yes, sir.

234
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:29,519
You won't tell me what's going on?

235
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:33,830
He must want to use me to be on good terms with Ms. Kim Young A.

236
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,159
He's suddenly acting friendly.

237
00:16:37,129 --> 00:16:39,830
Gosh. Seriously.

238
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:43,469
I wonder how any facial hair comes out through his skin,

239
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:45,069
given his skin is thick like iron.

240
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,170
Don't mind him.

241
00:16:47,170 --> 00:16:50,539
I'm reminded of the bean soup your mother used to make.

242
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,748
- It was the best. - It was really good.

243
00:16:52,749 --> 00:16:54,379
I had only heard about her.

244
00:16:54,979 --> 00:16:56,479
I had never met her in person either.

245
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:00,350
Thank you.

246
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:04,820
This is my mother.

247
00:17:05,259 --> 00:17:06,330
I see.

248
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:15,600
Have I met your mother before?

249
00:17:16,399 --> 00:17:17,540
No, I doubt it.

250
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:21,909
But why does she look so familiar?

251
00:17:31,379 --> 00:17:32,520
Wait.

252
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:38,090
Can you watch this with us, Bom?

253
00:17:41,859 --> 00:17:45,000
This lady right here. Doesn't she look like her mother?

254
00:17:50,899 --> 00:17:51,939
Mom!

255
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,009
Isn't that my mom?

256
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:55,879
She does look like your mom.

257
00:17:57,439 --> 00:17:59,810
Right. Then listen to this.

258
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:05,350
Can you repeat that? What did you watch?

259
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:08,320
But my daughter was sent to prison...

260
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:10,019
- for something she didn't do. - Mom.

261
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,529
If I tell you about the video, can you help my daughter?

262
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:13,789
Is this your mother's voice?

263
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:16,929
Yes. Why don't we talk in person?

264
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:18,458
- It's her voice. - I'll go to your office.

265
00:18:18,459 --> 00:18:19,698
I can just go to the Southwestern District...

266
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:21,029
- Prosecutors' Office, right? - What's all this?

267
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:22,299
She was an informant for Na Yu Mi's case.

268
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,240
But before that, can you give me your number?

269
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:29,080
My mother was the informant for Na Yu Mi's case?

270
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:34,679
Then her daughter who went to prison...

271
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:40,350
Hold on.

272
00:18:41,719 --> 00:18:42,859
The date...

273
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,530
It was exactly a year ago from today.

274
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:51,760
Keep watching this video.

275
00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:56,740
Right here.

276
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:59,510
Can you recognize this man here?

277
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,139
No.

278
00:19:05,139 --> 00:19:06,979
Your mother came to the prosecutors' office to make a report.

279
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,010
All of a sudden,

280
00:19:08,179 --> 00:19:10,050
she followed an unidentified man.

281
00:19:11,149 --> 00:19:13,149
- That's the day... - I don't believe this.

282
00:19:13,949 --> 00:19:16,859
I mean... This makes no sense.

283
00:19:17,719 --> 00:19:19,490
Does this mean my mother didn't commit suicide?

284
00:19:19,689 --> 00:19:21,388
Wait. It's too soon to say so.

285
00:19:21,389 --> 00:19:23,059
We don't have any proof that she was murdered.

286
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,958
He's right. She was too kind for anyone...

287
00:19:24,959 --> 00:19:26,128
to hold grudges against her.

288
00:19:26,129 --> 00:19:27,869
But my mother saw something.

289
00:19:28,129 --> 00:19:30,938
My mother was the witness for Na Yu Mi's case.

290
00:19:30,939 --> 00:19:33,608
No. Don't jump to conclusions.

291
00:19:33,609 --> 00:19:34,639
If you do,

292
00:19:35,439 --> 00:19:36,810
you'll get farther away from the truth.

293
00:19:50,459 --> 00:19:51,619
Thank you for today.

294
00:19:52,889 --> 00:19:53,929
Get home safely.

295
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,359
Stay strong.

296
00:19:58,699 --> 00:20:00,129
This is just the beginning.

297
00:21:14,939 --> 00:21:16,040
Noh Yul Seong.

298
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:24,179
The anonymous man.

299
00:21:34,189 --> 00:21:36,730
Are the two of them related...

300
00:21:37,959 --> 00:21:39,000
or not?

301
00:21:40,869 --> 00:21:41,899
Are they?

302
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,310
This must be it.

303
00:21:50,109 --> 00:21:51,240
This one.

304
00:21:52,709 --> 00:21:57,479
(The best tteokbokki in Seoul!)

305
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,990
(Danmuji and kimchi self-served)

306
00:22:08,429 --> 00:22:09,730
Coming right up.

307
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:12,169
They're here. We're over here.

308
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:13,428
Here.

309
00:22:13,429 --> 00:22:15,070
What were you up to?

310
00:22:16,469 --> 00:22:17,668
We'll have one set here.

311
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:18,840
Got it.

312
00:22:20,909 --> 00:22:22,208
Here's the set.

313
00:22:22,209 --> 00:22:23,980
- Here. - Thank you. It looks great.

314
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,109
It looks good.

315
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,448
- Let's eat. - Thank you.

316
00:22:29,449 --> 00:22:31,520
- Let's eat. - It looks so good.

317
00:22:38,659 --> 00:22:40,459
(The best tteokbokki in Seoul!)

318
00:22:50,699 --> 00:22:52,609
The prison officer's daughter, right?

319
00:22:53,669 --> 00:22:55,270
Yes. Hello.

320
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:59,480
It doesn't seem like someone from this area.

321
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:04,550
Has she said she was going to report someone?

322
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:06,020
No.

323
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,459
When was the last time you saw my mother?

324
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,560
It was two days before she passed away.

325
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:20,730
I scolded her for grilling meat for the part-timer.

326
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:22,339
I told her taking too much care of the part-timer...

327
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,840
would make the other restaurants look bad.

328
00:23:23,939 --> 00:23:25,739
Was there a part-timer?

329
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:29,080
She always called her, "So Hee," and took great care of her.

330
00:23:29,179 --> 00:23:30,780
She said the girl reminded her of her daughter.

331
00:23:31,879 --> 00:23:33,849
Do you have her number?

332
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:37,250
No. I only knew she was a student of the school in front.

333
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,520
Oh, right.

334
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:42,389
Here she is.

335
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:45,990
She brought her when we were eating together.

336
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:50,429
Right. Her last name was Bae. Bae So Hee.

337
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:53,600
- Bae So Hee? - Bae So Hee?

338
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,070
Open up, So Hee.

339
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:01,369
Did you think I would not know about you meeting another guy?

340
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:03,109
Open up!

341
00:24:03,709 --> 00:24:05,240
Open up, Bae So Hee!

342
00:24:05,909 --> 00:24:06,909
Hello?

343
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:13,749
Please stop.

344
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,419
Don't you know how much I love you?

345
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:17,419
You're all I have.

346
00:24:17,889 --> 00:24:20,560
I'll call the cops. Leave now.

347
00:24:25,399 --> 00:24:27,929
One, two...

348
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:30,770
Darn it! If you call the cops again,

349
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:33,239
- it won't end with just your ribs. - I want to report a stalker.

350
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,270
Gosh!

351
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,310
Hey, be ready for me.

352
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:57,429
Ms. Bae So Hee.

353
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:02,369
Is Ms. Bae So Hee here?

354
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:23,260
Ms. Bae So Hee?

355
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,490
Please open the door, Ms. Bae So Hee.

356
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:31,230
Ms. Bae So Hee?

357
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:39,570
Ms. Bae So Hee! Just a moment!

358
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,719
Who are you to come out from there?

359
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,790
Hold on!

360
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,409
I apologize, sir.

361
00:26:14,169 --> 00:26:17,280
Are you still going to say that part-timer isn't related?

362
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,079
You said she got away as soon as she saw you.

363
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:22,580
She might have run away because of that stalker.

364
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,350
I apologize, sir.

365
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:35,560
But if he's a stalker,

366
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,070
he must be an expert at finding girls.

367
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:42,270
Well, yes.

368
00:26:42,369 --> 00:26:43,369
Call that guy.

369
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,500
We have to use everything we can.

370
00:26:46,139 --> 00:26:47,169
Understood.

371
00:26:48,639 --> 00:26:52,209
I told you I lost contact with all of my exes.

372
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:55,510
The reason I reached out a friend's friend of my ex...

373
00:26:55,609 --> 00:26:56,679
was because of you.

374
00:26:58,149 --> 00:27:00,149
I'm sure there will be at least one.

375
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:02,320
Someone who is still in touch with the disappeared Bae So Hee.

376
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,040
Did you think I wouldn't find you...

377
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,340
if you move and switch jobs?

378
00:27:28,550 --> 00:27:29,550
Excuse me.

379
00:27:30,449 --> 00:27:31,679
What are you doing?

380
00:27:33,020 --> 00:27:34,020
Ms. Bae So Hee?

381
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:38,159
Is it you? You crazy lawyer punk.

382
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:42,600
What are you doing?

383
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,730
- Ms. Bae So Hee! - Bae So Hee!

384
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:56,840
Ms. Bae So Hee?

385
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:08,750
So the prison officer's daughter is...

386
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,530
Yes, it's me.

387
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:19,530
But why did you run away?

388
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:21,830
Who did you think I was?

389
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,609
Are you being chased?

390
00:28:41,719 --> 00:28:44,990
I'm sorry. I don't want to be involved in more.

391
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:46,929
What is that?

392
00:28:48,859 --> 00:28:50,429
What don't you want to be involved in?

393
00:28:51,899 --> 00:28:53,899
You know what my mom had gone through...

394
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,629
before she died, right?

395
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,369
Ms. Bae So Hee!

396
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,209
Ms. Bae So Hee!

397
00:29:06,909 --> 00:29:07,980
Ms. Bae So Hee!

398
00:29:37,939 --> 00:29:39,080
Darn it!

399
00:29:41,850 --> 00:29:42,949
Who's that guy?

400
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,520
Bae So Hee's stalker.

401
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:48,020
He went mad even during the investigation.

402
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:50,090
He went half mad.

403
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,760
He looks like a dangerous one.

404
00:29:53,629 --> 00:29:56,899
Then So Hee should have asked for our help.

405
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,359
Why? What did she say?

406
00:29:59,369 --> 00:30:00,600
She didn't want to get involved.

407
00:30:02,129 --> 00:30:03,800
It seemed like she knew about my mother's case.

408
00:30:16,179 --> 00:30:18,679
Will you give me your phone for just a moment?

409
00:30:19,619 --> 00:30:21,320
- My phone? - Yes.

410
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:24,020
Why?

411
00:30:24,959 --> 00:30:26,230
All right.

412
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:29,459
- What are you doing? - Just a moment.

413
00:30:39,709 --> 00:30:41,169
Whenever you miss your mom...

414
00:30:41,969 --> 00:30:43,209
Just a moment.

415
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:46,280
(Mom, Daughter)

416
00:30:48,709 --> 00:30:49,850
It's your mom's new phone.

417
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,449
Whenever you miss your mom, dial number one...

418
00:30:54,649 --> 00:30:56,189
and tell her everything you want.

419
00:30:58,459 --> 00:31:00,428
Whenever you feel steam coming up from your head,

420
00:31:00,429 --> 00:31:01,889
call you mom and cool down.

421
00:31:03,060 --> 00:31:05,629
I'll wait for Kim Sa Ra's head to cool down.

422
00:31:28,949 --> 00:31:30,659
(Mom)

423
00:31:34,389 --> 00:31:35,629
(Daughter)

424
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:40,069
The call cannot be connected. Please leave a message after the tone.

425
00:31:40,070 --> 00:31:41,469
You will be charged.

426
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:43,540
Mom.

427
00:31:46,669 --> 00:31:48,639
What happened that day?

428
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,550
I will make sure...

429
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,949
to find out.

430
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,649
Thanks.

431
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:29,350
My head has cooled down a bit, thanks to you.

432
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:46,928
Call me when you feel down.

433
00:32:46,929 --> 00:32:48,168
(Dong Gi Jun)

434
00:32:48,169 --> 00:32:49,270
I will go to you any time.

435
00:32:59,649 --> 00:33:02,819
The stalker boyfriend feels more suspicion.

436
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:03,979
It has to be conviction more than suspicion.

437
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,820
That will make him go wilder.

438
00:33:06,689 --> 00:33:07,689
Understood.

439
00:33:13,689 --> 00:33:15,059

(Please help my mom.)

443
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:48,560
Please help my mom.

444
00:33:49,899 --> 00:33:50,958
Please.

445
00:33:50,959 --> 00:33:53,169
(Please)

446
00:34:00,969 --> 00:34:03,209
I will meet you in an hour. Send me your address.

447
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:07,010
Bae So Hee will come to us.

448
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:08,679
Is she done with her hiding?

(Divorce Specialist SOLUTION)

450
00:34:24,029 --> 00:34:25,130
She was...

451
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:27,830
very good to me.

452
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:33,509
But why did you run away that day?

453
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:36,639
I was afraid.

454
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,679
What were you afraid of?

455
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:47,150

(The day of Na Yu Mi's death)

457
00:34:48,219 --> 00:34:50,690
After getting off work at the tteokbokki place,

458
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,489
I went to my next part-time job.

459
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:54,360
That was the start.

460
00:34:55,389 --> 00:34:57,799
I went to set up the room for the guests.

461
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:00,730
That was when I saw a suite room for the first time.

462
00:35:02,699 --> 00:35:05,100
I got a bit excited.

463
00:35:30,029 --> 00:35:32,629
A family member of the deceased Ms. Na...

464
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,068
continued to request for a reinvestigation through a protest.

465
00:35:34,069 --> 00:35:36,968
I got so surprised after hearing the news.

466
00:35:36,969 --> 00:35:38,468
Investigation continues...

467
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,040
What's wrong?

468
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,009
Do you know that person?

469
00:35:42,369 --> 00:35:43,409
The woman that died...

470
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:46,179
didn't commit suicide.

471
00:35:49,449 --> 00:35:53,049
Stop the party before I reveal these photos...

472
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:54,819
to your fiance.

473
00:35:58,219 --> 00:35:59,520
When did you take these?

474
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:03,429
Gosh. It's a nice photo.

475
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:05,159
Yu Mi.

476
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,900
My marriage isn't the world you think it is.

477
00:36:10,699 --> 00:36:12,170
And these won't be enough to stop it.

478
00:36:14,569 --> 00:36:15,739
- Is that so? - Yes.

479
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:18,839
Then how about the story with you and the five-member society...

480
00:36:20,409 --> 00:36:22,610
offering bribes here and there.

481
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,219
Will that stop the marriage?

482
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,420
Are you insane?

483
00:36:32,589 --> 00:36:33,589
Hey.

484
00:36:35,489 --> 00:36:37,799
The important part is in the back.

485
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:40,699
Get all of the photos and recordings...

486
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,029
from Na Yu Mi.

487
00:36:43,339 --> 00:36:44,940
If she gets into nonsense, take care of her.

488
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:48,670
How far shall I take things?

489
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:56,049
Hey, there are so many ways to get rid of her.

490
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,080
Why would you ask me that?

491
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:04,719
So she came to see me after that.

492
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:10,830
My mom went to prosecution.

493
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:12,259
Did you know about this?

494
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:15,198
Yes.

495
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:17,739
Did she go on her own?

496
00:37:20,639 --> 00:37:23,210
No. She went with me.

497
00:37:28,909 --> 00:37:30,818
Mrs. Park, I'll go to the restroom real quick.

498
00:37:30,819 --> 00:37:31,819
Sure.

After coming back from the restroom,

501
00:37:40,659 --> 00:37:41,730
she wasn't there.

502
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:43,460
I looked around for her,

503
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,729
and I saw her.

(Prosecution Service)

505
00:37:49,230 --> 00:37:50,469
Whose car was it?

506
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:52,199
Well...

507
00:37:56,069 --> 00:37:58,509
It was the secretary of the son-in-law.

508
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:02,509
- Right. - The guy in the hotel footage.

509

Noh Yul Seong...

510
00:38:05,219 --> 00:38:08,049
Was the son-in-law not around?

511
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:12,790
Someone was next to her.

512
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:15,029
But I couldn't see the face clearly.

513
00:38:15,429 --> 00:38:19,429
So the hotel footage was all deleted, right?

514
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:22,270
Yes.

515
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:33,008
Please testify to the police everything you just said.

516
00:38:33,009 --> 00:38:35,949
Will that make a difference?

517
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:38,380
You're the only hope I have.

518
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:42,189
First of all, leave the place you're staying right now...

519
00:38:42,190 --> 00:38:43,819
before the stalker comes for you again.

520
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,218
Right. Let's do that.

521
00:38:45,219 --> 00:38:46,960
We'll find a safe place.

522
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,670
Here.

523
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,040
Great work.

524
00:39:30,339 --> 00:39:34,009
I thought I would get an apology. But it's an envelope instead.

525
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:37,440
I guess this isn't too bad.

526
00:39:39,339 --> 00:39:40,810
You can stop now.

527
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:45,549
So it ends as a termination of contract?

528
00:39:47,589 --> 00:39:48,690
If that's so,

529
00:39:49,489 --> 00:39:51,360
I'll choose the gift for resignation.

530
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,489
Put me in as a candidate too.

531

My gosh.

534
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:04,899
Don't say that elsewhere.

535
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:06,439
Someone might think it's true.

536
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:07,509
Do I sound like I'm joking?

- Let's go. - Hello, Chairwoman Cha.

00:40:40,869 --> 00:40:42,440
Yes. That's right.

545
00:40:42,869 --> 00:40:43,940
Enjoy dating him.

546
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:46,440
He can date whoever he wants.

547
00:41:09,299 --> 00:41:11,499
(Gositel)

548
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,799
(3-da-gil 6, Tongin-ro)

549
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:21,909
Darn it.

550
00:41:28,449 --> 00:41:31,659
So Hee decided to go to the police. Let's go.

551
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:35,060
This will do.

552
00:41:40,799 --> 00:41:42,330
Let's go and get Noh Yul Seong now.

553
00:41:53,179 --> 00:41:55,250
Am I a ghost? Why are you scared?

554
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:57,380
Were you calling someone you were not supposed to?

555
00:41:57,750 --> 00:41:59,219
What's wrong with you?

556
00:42:01,319 --> 00:42:02,350
You're caught.

557
00:42:03,759 --> 00:42:04,819
A lawyer.

558
00:42:08,889 --> 00:42:10,730
I'm calling because of work.

559
00:42:11,929 --> 00:42:13,369
Did he buy you this?

560
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:15,069
Yes?

561
00:42:16,799 --> 00:42:17,900
I had it before.

562
00:42:18,299 --> 00:42:21,040
What did you do for those shoes?

563
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:26,179
You two have gone mad.

564
00:42:27,310 --> 00:42:29,049
(Lawyer)

565
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:32,449
I'll explain everything.

566
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:34,089
I'll explain everything.

567
00:42:34,489 --> 00:42:35,549
Let me go.

568
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:45,960
Hey, did you sleep with him?

569
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,699
Let it go.

570
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,369
They said she just went out, but she's not answering the phone.

571
00:42:52,339 --> 00:42:53,440
Where did she go?

572
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:55,710
I'll try to call her again.

573
00:43:12,989 --> 00:43:15,289
The phone is turned off. Please leave...

574
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:16,929
a message after the tone.

575
00:43:27,909 --> 00:43:28,969
For goodness' sake.

576
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:39,080
Hey, So Hee.

577
00:43:44,719 --> 00:43:47,989
(Lawyer)

578
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:12,219
(Lawyer)

579
00:44:51,759 --> 00:44:53,630
Is there no other data left by the part-timer?

580
00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:55,259
I checked everything.

581
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,489
Good. It's clear.

582
00:44:56,730 --> 00:44:59,360
But she returned your flowers again.

583
00:45:01,830 --> 00:45:03,569
Don't report something like that.

584
00:45:03,770 --> 00:45:06,869
Kim Young A got selected as the party representative now.

585
00:45:10,339 --> 00:45:12,509
For goodness' sake. This is annoying.

586
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:18,650
Deliver the flowers.

587
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:19,920
To SOLUTION?

588
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:23,790
Send it to the presidential candidate for the next election...

589
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:27,529
under both my name and Sa Ra's.

590
00:45:27,989 --> 00:45:30,929
Send new flower boxes to SOLUTION.

591
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:32,500
Okay.

592
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:49,650
Don't think about anything today...

593
00:45:50,819 --> 00:45:51,850
and just sleep well.

594
00:45:56,350 --> 00:45:57,360
Goodbye.

595
00:47:25,339 --> 00:47:26,380
Her birthday?

596
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:35,449
Phone number?

597
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,080
Sa Ra!

598
00:48:02,650 --> 00:48:04,880
Sa Ra! Kim Sa Ra!

599
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:07,819
Sa Ra, are you okay?

600
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:10,049
You're fine. Relax.

601
00:48:10,219 --> 00:48:12,389
Breathe. Breathe slowly.

602
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:20,630
Breathe out.

603
00:48:22,699 --> 00:48:25,400
Breathe in. You're fine.

604
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:43,520
Did you get to your senses?

605
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:47,489
How's your breathing?

606
00:48:52,199 --> 00:48:55,429
How much did you cry to experience hyperventilation?

607
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:16,719
What would we do without Bae So Hee?

608
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:21,029
We should look for another way.

609
00:49:24,330 --> 00:49:26,230
It's so unfair for my mom.

610
00:49:28,330 --> 00:49:29,730
Stay strong.

611
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:33,040
To prove whether So Hee's words are true,

612
00:49:34,540 --> 00:49:35,940
it could become a messy fight.

613
00:49:41,779 --> 00:49:43,049
Oh, wait.

614
00:49:45,549 --> 00:49:46,549
Here.

615
00:49:47,850 --> 00:49:48,920
Thank you.

616
00:49:57,429 --> 00:50:00,500
But how did you come in?

617
00:50:01,369 --> 00:50:02,369
Well,

618
00:50:03,770 --> 00:50:06,400
I keyed in my birthday, 1214.

619
00:50:10,940 --> 00:50:12,940
It's something I used before.

620
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:17,318
It's safe since no one will know.

621
00:50:17,319 --> 00:50:20,449
Yes, only one person can think of it.

622
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:22,388
There's no meaning to it.

623
00:50:22,389 --> 00:50:23,790
Of course.

624
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:28,290
I'll see you leave.

625
00:50:28,730 --> 00:50:30,560
I have a bad headache.

626
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:36,100
Never mind. I'll leave.

627
00:50:55,949 --> 00:50:57,989
The chess piece, which is our memory,

628
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:01,429
is still here because it's too much trouble to throw away,

629
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,500
and the fact that the entrance passcode is my birthday...

630
00:51:11,569 --> 00:51:13,069
doesn't mean anything either.

631
00:51:17,710 --> 00:51:19,580
We held hands in the hospital room,

632
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:22,480
but you didn't fall for me.

633
00:51:23,650 --> 00:51:26,250
All right. I'm fine with everything,

634
00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:29,619
so I'll wait.

635
00:51:33,659 --> 00:51:35,830
But it's too hard for you...

636
00:51:38,529 --> 00:51:39,659
to suffer alone during this time.

637
00:53:48,190 --> 00:53:49,230
Oh, you're here.

638
00:53:50,259 --> 00:53:51,929
Why didn't you rest more?

639
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:53,460
I'm okay.

640
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:56,569
Thanks for yesterday.

641
00:53:57,299 --> 00:53:58,299
Sure.

642
00:53:59,270 --> 00:54:01,610
I'm going to meet Na Yu Mi's taxi driver.

643
00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:02,968
We need to solve that case...

644
00:54:02,969 --> 00:54:04,639
in order to find clues related to your mother's case.

645
00:54:24,659 --> 00:54:25,699
I seem...

646
00:54:27,469 --> 00:54:30,529
to be a star sign that constantly feels sorry toward you.

647
00:54:32,799 --> 00:54:34,839
Don't be sorry to me.

648
00:54:36,139 --> 00:54:37,779
Then I'd need to understand you again.

649
00:54:40,279 --> 00:54:41,279
Wait.

650
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,489
Yesterday, I was...

651
00:54:49,319 --> 00:54:50,719
too emotional.

652
00:54:53,989 --> 00:54:55,060
Are you not today?

653
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:01,630
I liked you being emotional.

654
00:55:02,130 --> 00:55:04,029
Yes, I liked it.

655
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:06,940
I'll go to see him.

656
00:55:14,509 --> 00:55:18,080
So I won't feel sorry anymore.

657
00:55:32,659 --> 00:55:34,100
Oh, hello.

658
00:55:34,699 --> 00:55:37,400
- Hey. - Among the drivers,

659
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,739
is there anyone named Gong Deukgu?

660
00:55:40,909 --> 00:55:43,968
Oh. Mr. Gong? He resigned a long time ago.

661
00:55:43,969 --> 00:55:46,679
Where will he be working now?

662
00:55:46,779 --> 00:55:50,380
I think he's hired as a driver for a company.

663
00:55:53,880 --> 00:55:55,489
Thank you.

664
00:56:12,239 --> 00:56:13,339
Is anyone home?

665
00:56:18,810 --> 00:56:19,880
Is anyone there?

666
00:56:47,639 --> 00:56:48,739
Mr. Gong Deukgu.

667
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:31,318
A driver who wears designer shoes that are worth 9,000 dollars.

668
00:57:31,319 --> 00:57:32,679
(Gong Deukgu)

669
00:57:50,299 --> 00:57:52,440
Get in. I have something to tell you.

670
00:57:53,739 --> 00:57:56,310
What are you doing? Go to the passenger's seat.

671
00:58:10,850 --> 00:58:12,519
(Prime Minister)

672
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:14,429
(Congratulations on your election)

673
00:58:14,529 --> 00:58:16,860
It's difficult for me to resign from SOLUTION.

674
00:58:17,830 --> 00:58:21,469
But if you can appoint me as a freelance Advisory Committee,

675
00:58:22,270 --> 00:58:23,900
I'll do my best to assist you.

676
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:29,238
It's nice of you not to harshly refuse my offer.

677
00:58:29,239 --> 00:58:32,839
I'm sorry, but I have one condition.

678
00:58:35,049 --> 00:58:36,110
Right in my face?

679
00:58:36,909 --> 00:58:40,380
Let's hear what the scenario is this time.

680
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:45,560
Oh, Mr. Noh sent me a flower with your names on it.

681
00:58:46,619 --> 00:58:47,889
(Noh Yul Seong and Kim Sa Ra)

682
00:58:51,759 --> 00:58:53,100
(Hanjoo Party)

683
00:58:54,369 --> 00:58:56,529
I'll tell you my scenario.

684
00:58:58,969 --> 00:59:00,900
(Messenger Service)

685
00:59:16,589 --> 00:59:17,960
- Here you go. - Yes.

686
00:59:18,060 --> 00:59:19,259
- Have a nice day. - Thanks.

687
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:22,258
It's him again.

688
00:59:22,259 --> 00:59:24,429
Maybe it's not a mistake.

689
00:59:27,429 --> 00:59:28,529
I'll take care of it.

690
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:29,799
It's okay.

691
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:32,040
Put it on the table.

692
00:59:33,239 --> 00:59:34,940
It's nice to have some flowers in the office.

693
00:59:37,009 --> 00:59:39,779
Since I'm a bit distracted with my mom,

694
00:59:40,179 --> 00:59:43,710
please make sure the client list is organized by the two of you.

695
00:59:45,350 --> 00:59:46,350
Okay.

696
00:59:59,259 --> 01:00:00,299
What's wrong with you?

697
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:04,799
Aren't you sending the flowers away?

698
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:08,540
I'll just take them.

699
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:13,339
Noh Yul Seong sent them.

700
01:00:16,909 --> 01:00:18,080
He wants to marry me again.

701
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:21,949
Who? Noh Yul Seong?

702
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:24,790
So?

703
01:00:28,589 --> 01:00:29,659
I'm going to...

704
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:33,400
go back to his house.

705
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:52,080
(Queen of Divorce)

706
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:23,008
Stop it now. Don't mess with Sa Ra.

707
01:01:23,009 --> 01:01:24,380
I don't think about anything impossible.

708
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:25,650
I only think about something possible.

709
01:01:25,850 --> 01:01:27,448
What's the end of this remarriage?

710
01:01:27,449 --> 01:01:30,150
I'm creating a solution for me this time.

711
01:01:30,250 --> 01:01:31,818
The solution code is Kim Sa Ra.

712
01:01:31,819 --> 01:01:33,459
You're such an idiot.

713
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:35,588
I told you many times not to trust anyone.

714
01:01:35,589 --> 01:01:36,789
That's why you're a failure.

715
01:01:36,790 --> 01:01:39,029
Then why do you trust Gong Deukgu?

716
01:01:39,130 --> 01:01:40,130
Is he the right person?

717
01:01:40,131 --> 01:01:42,100
Was he Na Yu Mi's taxi driver?

718
01:01:42,199 --> 01:01:43,298
Is he the one who took my mom too?

719
01:01:43,299 --> 01:01:45,869
I think I saw those shoes before.

720
01:01:46,299 --> 01:01:47,940
I've kept my secret until now.

721
01:01:48,170 --> 01:01:49,839
I'm looking for this man.

722
01:01:50,710 --> 01:01:53,980
Isn't he Gong Deukgu?
