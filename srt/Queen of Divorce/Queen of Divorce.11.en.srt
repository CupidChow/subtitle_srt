(Queen of Divorce)

00:00:50,179 --> 00:00:55,690
(On the day of Park Jeong Suk, Sa Ra's mother's death)

6
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:01,898
Where am I?

7
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:04,029
Mother, this factory area seems to have no luck.

8
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:08,100
Right? They're bankrupt again.

9
00:01:10,169 --> 00:01:11,169
But...

10
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,380
why are you like this?

11
00:01:14,809 --> 00:01:16,880
Why are you doing this?

12
00:01:18,809 --> 00:01:19,880
Mother.

13
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:22,619
Why did you go to see a prosecutor?

14
00:01:23,679 --> 00:01:26,190
Did you think I was joking?

15
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:29,319
Did you not understand what I said?

16
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:35,099
I heard you ordering others to get rid of Na Yu Mi.

17
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,599
If you clear my daughter's name,

18
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,130
I'll also keep my mouth shut.

19
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,300
This is absurd.

20
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:45,240
If you make such nonsense remarks one more time,

21
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:48,339
you'll end up just like your daughter.

22
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,649
Do you understand?

23
00:01:52,149 --> 00:01:53,949
Yul Seong, please. I beg you.

24
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:55,519
- Please. - Let it go.

25
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,880
Yul Seong, please!

26
00:01:58,589 --> 00:02:01,088
It's not because of that.

27
00:02:01,089 --> 00:02:02,919
I don't know anything.

28
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:08,899
Okay.

29
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,899
Where did you hear what I said that day?

30
00:02:16,799 --> 00:02:18,340
I just told them...

31
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,078
to scare Na Yu Mi a bit.

32
00:02:21,079 --> 00:02:22,410
Do you think I'm crazy?

33
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:25,108
What do you think will happen...

34
00:02:25,109 --> 00:02:27,150
if you go and tell this story to the prosecutor?

35
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:29,018
Then, they will investigate enthusiastically.

36
00:02:29,019 --> 00:02:30,019
I'll be framed as the culprit.

37
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,249
What will happen to my marriage, then?

38
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:34,220
Think about it! It'll ruin my marriage.

39
00:02:36,919 --> 00:02:39,489
Think before you act! For goodness' sake!

40
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:41,199
You're really frustrating.

41
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:44,129
Come here. For goodness' sake.

42
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:46,168
Who was it? Answer now.

43
00:02:46,169 --> 00:02:47,529
I don't know. I really don't know.

44
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:50,568
Tell me now. Who's the blabbermouth?

45
00:02:50,569 --> 00:02:51,639
I don't know.

46
00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:53,910
I really don't know.

47
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,339
"I really don't know. I don't know."

48
00:02:57,340 --> 00:02:58,609
I'm tired of this!

49
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:17,799
Mr. Noh.

50
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,430
The Law School Select Committee...

51
00:03:51,569 --> 00:03:53,129
has direct and indirect connections...

52
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:54,669
with the government and ruling party.

53
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,798
Through various connections...

54
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,508
with the party representative, Kim Young A and others,

55
00:03:59,509 --> 00:04:01,478
we'll identify the inclinations of the Select Committee.

56
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:04,038
We are devising a strategy to convince them...

57
00:04:04,039 --> 00:04:06,280
to support our law firm as much as possible.

58
00:04:06,449 --> 00:04:08,419
I will explain...

59
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,449
the persuasion strategy in three stages.

60

(Emergency Medical Center)

63
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:34,410
They said Gong Deukgu is recovering.

64
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,939
His life is not in danger.

65
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,548
We need to see him before Noh Yul Seong does.

66
00:04:39,549 --> 00:04:42,479
Let's just say you weren't at the scene for now.

67
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:43,979
It'll be dangerous if Noh Yul Seong figures out.

68
00:04:44,379 --> 00:04:45,989
Tell the police the same too.

69
00:05:03,299 --> 00:05:04,910
Have you heard what happened to Mr. Gong?

(General)

72
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:16,950
What are you doing?

73
00:05:17,789 --> 00:05:19,419
The car that almost got crushed...

74
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,760
was rented by Kang Bom.

75
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,799
Deception by a spouse is grounds for annulment. You know, right?

76
00:05:33,729 --> 00:05:35,400
You'll never see Seo Yun again.

77
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,210
Don't regret it later, and tell me the truth now.

78
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:40,840
You asked them to do this, right?

79
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,619
- Yes. - Yes?

80
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:53,789
I asked Bom to see...

81
00:05:54,119 --> 00:05:57,489
if Mr. Gong is related to my mother's case in any way.

82
00:05:58,129 --> 00:05:59,759
But suddenly, she said Mr. Gong...

83
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,530
got into an accident while running away.

84
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:08,340
That's it?

85
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,999
Isn't it strange?

86
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,439
Why would Mr. Gong run away?

87
00:06:18,549 --> 00:06:20,979
I'll need to ask the chairwoman.

88
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,390
Then, who instigated Gong Deukgu's case?

89
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,359
Look into it and report to me.

90
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:42,499
Why didn't you knock before coming in?

91
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,140
I have something to show you.

92
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,609
My mother passed away...

93
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:55,580
after she followed Mr. Gong.

94
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,989
He was your driver back then.

95
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:01,219
Is that Mr. Gong?

96
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,260
Why was he there?

97
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:08,229
Did you perhaps ask him to drive my mom here?

98
00:07:11,369 --> 00:07:12,869
What is she talking about?

99
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:15,739
Are you doubting my mom?

100
00:07:16,999 --> 00:07:18,809
Who would I doubt, then?

101
00:07:20,609 --> 00:07:22,640
Don't you know anything?

102
00:07:23,739 --> 00:07:25,510
Or are you pretending not to?

103
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:27,749
Get out.

104
00:07:28,679 --> 00:07:32,289
- Mother, you didn't do it, did you? - I said, get out.

105
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,950
Why was Mr. Gong there?

106
00:08:06,989 --> 00:08:08,720
That's what I want to ask you.

107
00:08:10,189 --> 00:08:11,389
Did you send him there?

108
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:14,030
Seriously. Why would I?

109
00:08:17,559 --> 00:08:20,668
If you didn't, then never mind. I'll check with Mr. Gong.

110
00:08:20,669 --> 00:08:22,499
No, I'll talk to him.

111
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:24,498
Just leave it to me.

112
00:08:24,499 --> 00:08:27,438
He's like a time bomb to you.

113
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:29,679
Stay put. I'll take care of it.

114
00:08:45,989 --> 00:08:47,659
When did CEO Noh's mother-in-law pass away?

115
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,700
Get me Mr. Gong's transportation log of that day.

116
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:06,479
- Yes! It's Lawyer Dong! - You shocked me.

117
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:09,648
You suggested we stage a fraud,

118
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:11,550
but what will we do if the fraudulent couple breaks up?

119
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:14,320
Yes, well...

120
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:17,518
so we'll stick around each other every time.

121
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:18,529
We'll never...

122
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,359
So that we won't break up again.

123
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,029
Please don't.

124
00:09:22,859 --> 00:09:23,859
Looking forward to your cooperation.

125
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:30,499
Oh, what should we do with Gong Deukgu?

126
00:09:31,369 --> 00:09:33,710
It's difficult to access him as he's in the intensive care unit.

127
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:36,239
I think we need to change our target.

128
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:39,149
Let's have the culprit speak, not the witness.

129
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:42,320
- Confession. - Or soliloquy.

130
00:09:43,479 --> 00:09:46,789
I'll throw them into the fiery pit of mistrust and confess their sins.

131
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,858
What we need is...

132
00:09:48,859 --> 00:09:50,159
What we learned from Noh Yul Seong.

133
00:09:51,889 --> 00:09:52,930
Instigating.

134
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,460
I know a person who acts well.

135
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,700
Me?

136
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,399
Why is it me again? What is it?

137
00:10:03,739 --> 00:10:06,840
That son is trying to take over the law firm...

138
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:08,840
behind his own mother's back.

139
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:11,079
- Chayul Law Firm? - Yes.

140
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,210
- So that rumor is true? - Yes!

141
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:17,278
That woman doesn't give her son any authority at all.

142
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,690
She's so mean.

143
00:10:19,749 --> 00:10:21,220
- Honey. - Yes?

144
00:10:21,489 --> 00:10:24,759
- You need to be aware of drivers. - Why?

145
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:26,988
It seems that the son managed to sway...

146
00:10:26,989 --> 00:10:28,300
her driver.

147
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:32,498
How many secrets do you think he heard while driving?

148
00:10:32,499 --> 00:10:34,599
So many. Countless.

149
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,669
- That's what I'm saying. - I should make them be wary.

150
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:38,369
Yes, you should.

151
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:41,008
They have so much time.

152
00:10:41,009 --> 00:10:43,739
What could possibly happen between my son and me?

153
00:10:44,409 --> 00:10:46,550
Anyway. Thanks, Ms. Kwon.

154
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:51,889
Come in.

155
00:10:57,159 --> 00:10:58,960
What about Mr. Gong's transportation log?

156
00:10:59,729 --> 00:11:01,628
On that day last year,

157
00:11:01,629 --> 00:11:04,159
Mr. Gong drove CEO Noh's car.

158
00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:08,238
And Gong Deukgu's accident seems to be caused by CEO Noh.

159
00:11:08,239 --> 00:11:09,440
I'll investigate further.

160
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,570
(Mr. Gong)

161
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:45,639
(Mr. Gong)

162
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:48,440
(Mr. Gong)

163
00:11:49,239 --> 00:11:50,639
(Chairwoman Cha)

164
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:07,389
Did you want to see me?

165
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:10,430
Why do you have Mr. Gong's phone?

166
00:12:12,529 --> 00:12:15,040
I found it at the scene of the accident.

167
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,269
You purposely went to the scene?

168
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:20,810
You happen to have the phone that the police missed.

169
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:24,879
It was you.

170
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,679
You tried to kill Mr. Gong...

171
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,519
and ordered him to bring your mother-in-law to you.

172
00:12:31,379 --> 00:12:33,619
What are you talking about?

173
00:12:34,249 --> 00:12:35,820
How dare you ask me if I did it?

174
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,989
Why? Were you trying to frame me?

175
00:12:41,489 --> 00:12:42,628
I'm your son.

176
00:12:42,629 --> 00:12:44,728
I'm about to crack open my son's head...

177
00:12:44,729 --> 00:12:48,398
and see what he is thinking,

178
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,940
so shut your mouth.

179
00:13:02,379 --> 00:13:04,049
(My brother is being threatened by CEO Noh.)

180
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,050
(This is Mr. Gong's brother.)

181
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:06,119
(He's in a desperate situation and asking for your help.)

182
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:14,789
"My brother is being threatened by CEO Noh."

183
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:17,560
"He's being coerced into saying that everything was instructed by you."

184
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,369
Noh Yul Seong, this crazy jerk.

185
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:29,180
(Calling)

186
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:39,090
(Chairwoman Cha)

187
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:43,690
(I'm unavailable for a call.)

188
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:57,470
Superintendent. It's me.

189
00:13:59,139 --> 00:14:01,710
I need the police to take action.

190
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,278
Seo Yun, it's time to go to bed.

191
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,019
Okay. This is my last round.

192
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:12,989
It should be the last.

193
00:14:37,979 --> 00:14:39,080
Seo Yun, what's this?

194
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:42,180
I need to put them together again.

195
00:14:43,119 --> 00:14:44,649
Did you do this?

196
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:46,719
When I was in the States,

197
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,158
Grandma told me that you abandoned me.

198
00:14:49,159 --> 00:14:51,519
So I abandoned you for a while too.

199
00:14:53,290 --> 00:14:54,290
Seo Yun.

200
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:04,169
You know that Grandma lied, right?

201
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:05,509
Yes, of course!

202
00:15:09,379 --> 00:15:10,580
I'm sorry, Seo Yun.

203
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:14,050
To you, they are your dad and grandma.

204
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,220
But I can't forgive them.

205
00:16:32,229 --> 00:16:34,290
(CEO Noh Yul Seong)

206
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,800
Ms. Kim went into Hanjoo Party's building.

207
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:44,570
(Kim Sa Ra)

208
00:16:46,009 --> 00:16:47,009
Hello?

209
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:49,210
Today is the Law School Select Committee's presentation day, right?

210
00:16:49,479 --> 00:16:51,239
I'll speak about it since I'm at Hanjoo Party now.

211
00:16:51,409 --> 00:16:52,479
Sure.

212
00:16:52,509 --> 00:16:54,550
Why are you proactively seeking out for me?

213
00:16:56,119 --> 00:16:57,350
I'm bragging.

214
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,590
Telling you that I'm doing what I should.

215
00:17:01,550 --> 00:17:02,560
Okay.

216
00:17:07,729 --> 00:17:09,260
(Hanjoo Party)

217
00:17:23,139 --> 00:17:25,510
(SOLUTION)

218
00:17:27,149 --> 00:17:31,050
While Sa Ra... No. While Ms. Kim is on vacation,

219
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,889
will SOLUTION be on break?

220
00:17:34,889 --> 00:17:37,689
Well, not really.

221
00:17:38,689 --> 00:17:41,729
About the five-member society...

222
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:44,230
I heard something more about it from my father.

223
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,070
But I can't reach Sa Ra.

224
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,169
I see.

225
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,138
I'm sure she didn't keep it a secret on purpose.

226
00:17:56,139 --> 00:17:57,378
She might've been too busy.

227
00:17:57,379 --> 00:17:58,780
Why? Is she sick?

228
00:18:04,179 --> 00:18:05,750
She got remarried recently...

229
00:18:06,689 --> 00:18:07,719
with CEO Noh.

230
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:15,090
I'm sorry. No,

231
00:18:17,459 --> 00:18:18,570
I regret to tell you.

232
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,639
It's the worst, right?

233
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,369
You mean...

234
00:18:30,639 --> 00:18:32,679
she replaced...

235
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:36,520
my place?

236
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:40,590
No, it's not like that.

237
00:18:42,490 --> 00:18:43,490
Ms. Han.

238
00:18:45,219 --> 00:18:46,290
Ms. Han.

239
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,070
Long time no see.

240
00:18:54,369 --> 00:18:56,969
Congratulations on your remarriage.

241
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,639
I did it for revenge.

242
00:19:03,939 --> 00:19:05,879
I'll make him repay what he did to me...

243
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,810
and to you.

244
00:19:09,719 --> 00:19:11,280
We're still on the same side.

245
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,119
(Non-smoking Building)

246
00:19:24,199 --> 00:19:26,968
It's been a while since he moved to this room, but he still sleeping.

247
00:19:26,969 --> 00:19:29,070
I'm almost there. Wait for me.

248
00:19:32,209 --> 00:19:33,769
- Please go out. - This way, please.

249
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:36,780
- Wait a minute. - Just a moment.

250
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,408
- Hurry and come out. - Hurry.

251
00:19:38,409 --> 00:19:40,049
- Hurry and come out. - This way, please.

252
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:41,579
- Hurry and come out. - My goodness.

253
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,280
There's nothing here.

254
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:46,090
- Move slowly. - Slowly come this way.

255
00:19:46,850 --> 00:19:48,419
- Where is the fire? - Where?

256
00:19:48,719 --> 00:19:50,859
- It was so hard to come out. - There's no smoke.

257
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,090
- Where is the fire? - I think we're good.

258
00:19:56,629 --> 00:19:58,198
I think it was a false alarm.

259
00:19:58,199 --> 00:20:00,199
- You can come in. Thank you. - My goodness.

260
00:20:00,469 --> 00:20:01,469
I'll help.

261
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:20,590
Hey.

262
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:22,490
How is Ms. Han?

263
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:24,919
Is she okay? How did it go?

264
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,290
I think she was very shocked.

265
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:29,359
I couldn't even talk about the five-member society.

266
00:20:29,659 --> 00:20:32,270
Give her some time. I bet she needs it.

267
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:37,139
I thought I knew you the best, but I was shocked too.

268
00:20:37,939 --> 00:20:38,969
It's natural.

269
00:20:39,869 --> 00:20:41,340
Are you fine now?

270
00:20:42,379 --> 00:20:43,409
About what?

271
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,480
Everything.

272
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:50,520
The fact that I went into his house again and everything.

273
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,260
What's wrong?

274
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,760
You're going through the toughest time right now.

275
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:06,129
So let's end this quickly.

276
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:12,609
Give me a minute.

277
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:17,540
- Yes, hello? - Gong Deukgu ran away!

278
00:21:17,639 --> 00:21:19,608
We're chasing him. Be careful!

279
00:21:19,609 --> 00:21:21,909
How did he run away? By himself?

280
00:21:22,149 --> 00:21:24,350
Someone got him out. I'm not sure who it is.

281
00:21:28,219 --> 00:21:29,219
Stop the car.

282
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:33,159
- What's going on? - Wait.

283
00:21:33,359 --> 00:21:35,428
- Wait here. - Let me follow you.

284
00:21:35,429 --> 00:21:37,859
No. If they run away again, chase them immediately.

285
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,669
Hey. Darn it.

286
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:23,179
Get yourself together, Kang Bom. Don't lose yourself.

287
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,580
Who was that?

288
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,409
Let's get to a hospital.

289
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:00,708
Be careful!

290
00:23:00,709 --> 00:23:03,249
Be careful.

291
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:06,490
It's narrow here. Be careful.

292
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:08,490
Are you okay?

293
00:23:08,719 --> 00:23:10,619
You've gone through so much. Take a seat.

294
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,859
- Okay. - Careful.

295
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:16,230
Are you okay?

296
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:18,629
The stitches were done neatly.

297
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,329
I thought I was going to faint,

298
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:22,869
thinking something might happen to Bom.

299
00:23:23,399 --> 00:23:27,270
Just you wait. I'll bring them right in front of you.

300
00:23:34,909 --> 00:23:36,619
Let's get better soon and catch them.

301
00:23:36,719 --> 00:23:37,719
Right.

302
00:23:38,619 --> 00:23:41,050
It must be Noh Yul Seong at the end of all of this anyway.

303
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,320
That is the problem.

304
00:23:42,889 --> 00:23:46,189
Noh Yul Seong will find out what you're doing.

305
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:49,358
What do we do? What if he goes mad...

306
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:51,030
thinking about his mom and Ms. Kim?

307
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:54,369
We have to make a decision.

308
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:59,740
Ms. Kim, you should leave that house now.

309
00:24:00,209 --> 00:24:01,240
Don't worry.

310
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:04,340
How can I not worry?

311
00:24:04,439 --> 00:24:06,949
You can't stop me until the law school gets decided.

312
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:09,679
There's still some time left until that.

313
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:14,250
I knew it.

314
00:24:27,669 --> 00:24:29,070
Stay still.

315
00:24:30,639 --> 00:24:31,639
What is this?

316
00:24:35,010 --> 00:24:36,439
There are no bugs on you for now.

317
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:39,109
You won't be leaving that house.

318
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:40,779
Then equip yourself, at least.

319
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:43,679
This is the start of a war.

320
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:54,889
Come in.

321
00:24:56,929 --> 00:24:58,000
Let's get going.

322
00:24:59,369 --> 00:25:02,639
Let's take a look at that cat with nine lives.

323
00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:10,240
Who are you?

324
00:25:11,709 --> 00:25:13,580
You must get interviewed as a witness...

325
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,819
regarding the case of Park Jeong Suk's death.

326
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,020
(Request for Attendance)

327
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:19,050
My mother-in-law?

328
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:21,889
This happened ages ago. Why bring it back up now?

329
00:25:22,219 --> 00:25:23,490
Did something new come up?

330
00:25:23,659 --> 00:25:25,489
I cannot tell you that as it is confidential.

331
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:27,990
Excuse me. I'm the CEO of Chayul.

332
00:25:28,929 --> 00:25:30,158
I don't care how serious things are.

333
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,398
Who makes a request for attendance as a witness like this?

334
00:25:32,399 --> 00:25:36,240
That is why I'm here to ask you.

335
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:44,040
What has Kim Sa Ra been babbling about this time?

336
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:49,350
The day your mother-in-law, Park Jeong Suk, died,

337
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:52,889
Gong Deukgu was driving your car. Am I correct?

338
00:25:53,649 --> 00:25:55,989
Let's keep things fair. What started all of this?

339
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:59,230
I have to know to be able to provide a helpful answer.

340
00:25:59,730 --> 00:26:02,459
We received a significant piece of footage. How's that?

341
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:04,830
The CCTV footage of Southwestern District Prosecutors' Office?

342
00:26:05,659 --> 00:26:08,029
How am I supposed to know what my driver did?

343
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:10,500
Just answer my question before I make you the suspect.

344
00:26:12,669 --> 00:26:13,709
Sir.

345
00:26:16,439 --> 00:26:17,938
- The chief's call. - Right now?

346
00:26:17,939 --> 00:26:18,939
Yes.

347
00:26:23,179 --> 00:26:27,020
I heard Gong Deukgu sold the fuel in the company's car.

348
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,458
And he got caught.

349
00:26:29,459 --> 00:26:31,089
(Personnel Card)

350
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,289
(Disciplinary Actions)

351
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:34,560
We know how things will be for the one who holds grudges.

352
00:26:34,659 --> 00:26:36,459
We will not call for him separately.

353
00:26:41,369 --> 00:26:42,369
Personnel records?

354
00:26:46,969 --> 00:26:48,369
Was the chairwoman here?

355
00:26:52,209 --> 00:26:53,949
So it wasn't Kim Sa Ra.

356
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,149
It was the chairwoman.

357
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:01,649
I make sure to pay her back with my loyalty.

358
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:06,159
You should also be a good son and melt away her worries.

359
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:39,290
What happened?

360
00:27:39,291 --> 00:27:40,959
The part about reporting you?

361
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:43,429
Or the part about bailing you out?

362
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:47,030
Both.

363
00:27:49,639 --> 00:27:52,000
I can't send you to paradise.

364
00:27:53,810 --> 00:27:55,669
But I can send you down the fiery pit.

365
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,740
And the only one who can save you out of that pit is me.

366
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:03,418
So that was why you wanted to...

367
00:28:03,419 --> 00:28:05,080
teach your all-grown son a lesson.

368
00:28:05,179 --> 00:28:06,849
I wanted to show you what would happen...

369
00:28:06,850 --> 00:28:08,719
if you try to do something in secret on your own.

370
00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:11,418
Always keep in mind that there are mothers and fathers...

371
00:28:11,419 --> 00:28:13,659
who can eat their own children.

372
00:28:46,129 --> 00:28:47,928
- Move. Look at me. - No!

373
00:28:47,929 --> 00:28:49,859
- No! - I said look at me.

374
00:28:56,869 --> 00:28:57,869
Bonk.

375
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:08,780
Great job making it back alive.

376
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:12,080
Before you die,

377
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:15,320
there's one thing left for you to do.

378
00:29:15,889 --> 00:29:17,290
Right.

379
00:29:34,409 --> 00:29:36,439
- You... - What's wrong?

380
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:39,550
You wanted me nice and dead.

381
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,679
Are you shocked I'm back?

382
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:48,019
I have nothing to do with your accident.

383
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:50,919
No. I believe you are involved.

384
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,688
My life started falling apart as soon as you told me...

385
00:29:53,689 --> 00:29:55,090
to kill Na Yu Mi.

386
00:29:55,189 --> 00:29:56,359
Will you not shut your mouth?

387
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,629
I just did as I was told.

388
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:01,570
And now you want me sent away?

389
00:30:02,530 --> 00:30:04,740
- Can you really do that to me? - Are you deaf?

390
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,740
I'll give you the money to live abroad.

391
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,510
Make it two million dollars upfront. Then I'll get lost.

392
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,740
This guy is making deals again.

393
00:30:15,209 --> 00:30:16,879
That's enough. Get out of there.

394
00:30:18,719 --> 00:30:23,060
What should I do? Call the cops or get the money from you?

395
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:35,830
My daily transfer limit is 300,000 dollars.

396
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,968
(CEO Noh Yul Seong)

397
00:30:40,969 --> 00:30:42,270
(A total of 300,000 dollars has been transferred.)

398
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:50,080
If only you hadn't gotten on my nerves,

399
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:52,480
we wouldn't have come this far.

400
00:31:08,070 --> 00:31:10,300
CEO Noh, you've heard everything nice and clear, right?

401
00:31:12,939 --> 00:31:15,239
I'll send you 1.7 million dollars without the 300,000 dollars you got.

402
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,139
It'll be the end of you if you don't get on that plane.

403
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,678
Darn it. Why would you exclude the 300,000 dollars?

404
00:31:18,679 --> 00:31:22,080
If you start making deals with Kim Sa Ra, you'll be dead.

405
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:36,060
You don't even know what your wife is doing behind you.

406
00:31:36,730 --> 00:31:38,659
Was my wife around on the day of your accident?

407
00:32:04,919 --> 00:32:06,090
What are you doing here?

408
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:09,060
I forgot to water the plants.

409
00:32:09,659 --> 00:32:10,659
I'm done now.

410
00:32:49,129 --> 00:32:51,698
What do we do? What if he goes mad...

411
00:32:51,699 --> 00:32:53,409
doubting his mom and Ms. Kim?

415
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:40,990
So...

416
00:33:42,149 --> 00:33:44,820
Gong Deukgu is hiding right behind CEO Noh?

417
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:49,830
That's enough. Call CEO Noh for me.

418
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:01,169
Why are you coming out from there?

419
00:34:02,709 --> 00:34:04,179
I had a book to look up.

420
00:34:06,109 --> 00:34:08,079
Maybe you still smell.

Do you know that we use the same perfume?

423
00:34:26,799 --> 00:34:29,670
You smell just like I do.

424
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:33,509
You can stop worrying about how I smell.

425
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:36,339
You should worry about the stench coming from your son.

426
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:38,679
What?

427
00:34:55,889 --> 00:34:58,699
CEO Noh tried to bug me.

428
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:02,369
But I wasn't the only one he tried to bug.

429
00:35:08,909 --> 00:35:10,338
You spied on me?

430
00:35:10,339 --> 00:35:12,408
What's the purpose behind this?

431
00:35:12,409 --> 00:35:14,110
Calm down first.

432
00:35:17,279 --> 00:35:18,319
You!

433
00:35:20,049 --> 00:35:21,119
Darn it.

434
00:35:29,929 --> 00:35:31,928
My life started falling apart as soon as you told me...

435
00:35:31,929 --> 00:35:33,299
to kill Na Yu Mi.

436
00:35:33,569 --> 00:35:34,630
Will you not shut your mouth?

437
00:35:35,069 --> 00:35:36,940
I just did as I was told.

438
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,440
You...

439
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:42,670
Are you threatening me?

440
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:44,239
I'm making a deal.

441
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:48,109
I'm pleading you not to scare your son by calling the police.

442
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:50,219
Just don't go wild on your own.

443
00:35:51,319 --> 00:35:52,850
Mother, all of this has started...

444
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,959
because you got your hands on Na Yu Mi.

445
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,158
She came to me wanting to stop your remarriage.

446
00:36:00,159 --> 00:36:01,789
She would have caused trouble if I hadn't stopped her.

447
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:03,428
You should have just scared her.

448
00:36:03,429 --> 00:36:04,959
Don't you see that I did this for your sake?

449
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,569
- How could you... - Did I ask for your help?

450
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:10,440
Then why did you do that with your mother-in-law?

451
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:19,009
Noh Yul Seong.

452
00:36:19,949 --> 00:36:21,310
Hurry up and admit it.

453
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:24,319
Who says I did it?

454
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:27,690
Do you have evidence?

455
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,029
I...

456
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:41,829
do things the way you taught me.

457
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:44,838
Whoever shows their teeth against me will get bitten by me.

458
00:36:44,839 --> 00:36:45,839
Do you get it now?

459
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:47,440
Being hasty will get you nowhere.

460
00:37:01,650 --> 00:37:02,690
Come out to the garden.

461
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:20,440
Gong Deukgu has departed to the Philippines.

462
00:37:22,469 --> 00:37:24,980
I failed in getting Noh Yul Seong's admission.

463
00:37:25,779 --> 00:37:27,179
I got evidence on Chairwoman Cha.

464
00:37:27,549 --> 00:37:28,909
I'm thinking about how to deal with her.

465
00:37:39,659 --> 00:37:43,360
I forgot about Kim Sa Ra's crazy learning ability.

466
00:37:46,199 --> 00:37:47,730
She copied my method with the bugging.

467
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:50,069
- What? - She knows everything.

468
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:53,609
The case of her mother and Na Yu Mi.

469
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:54,639
But why are you leaving her alone?

470
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:59,179
The D-day is when Chayul Law Firm gets selected.

471
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:02,009
You have to do well until then.

472
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,818
It's not me. It's Kim Sa Ra.

473
00:38:04,819 --> 00:38:06,750
That was why I told you it was a no for her!

474
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:15,830
Until then, we're sleeping with the enemy.

475
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:18,999
You have to do a good job pretending to be fooled.

476
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,500
And bring down your temper just a little bit.

477
00:38:25,739 --> 00:38:27,609
Put me to bed.

478
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:29,238
What happened to yesterday's promise?

479
00:38:29,239 --> 00:38:30,678
You said you were going to sleep on your own.

480
00:38:30,679 --> 00:38:32,110
Just ten minutes. That's it.

481
00:38:33,210 --> 00:38:34,649
Seo Yun.

482
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:36,080
Just ten minutes.

483
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:24,460
Where would Kim Sa Ra keep the bugged files?

484
00:39:28,529 --> 00:39:30,040
Gosh.

485
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:01,929
(Divorce Specialist SOLUTION)

486
00:40:07,569 --> 00:40:08,569
What?

487
00:40:09,239 --> 00:40:10,580
It's a gift to boost you up.

488
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:26,960
Are things not going well?

489
00:40:28,389 --> 00:40:29,729
He's across the seas.

490
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:32,060
It's hard to get through to Gong Deukgu.

491
00:40:34,029 --> 00:40:36,698
You should do a good job.

492
00:40:36,699 --> 00:40:39,569
Just like how you hacked my heart.

493
00:40:41,069 --> 00:40:42,069
What?

494
00:40:44,009 --> 00:40:45,209
Let's hurry up and catch Gong Deukgu...

495
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:47,279
and eat something nice with me.

496
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:49,310
What?

497
00:40:53,389 --> 00:40:54,650
The overseas gambling group in the Philippines?

498
00:40:54,989 --> 00:40:56,349
I heard someone got caught...

499
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:58,989
losing 1.3 million dollars in a week at a casino.

500
00:40:59,389 --> 00:41:00,690
After searching who it was,

501
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:02,790
it turned out to be Gong Deukgu.

502
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:09,429
Where did he get the money?

503
00:41:11,339 --> 00:41:12,369
Some law firm.

504
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:14,409
Some law firm?

505
00:41:15,569 --> 00:41:16,638
They're going to have a headache.

506
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:18,908
Gongdeukgu received two million dollars.

507
00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:20,949
The prosecution is suspecting money laundering.

508
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:22,380
He's being traced.

509
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:25,350
Noh Yul Seong will be doing his best to get involved...

510
00:41:25,549 --> 00:41:26,549
and stop the investigation.

511
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:28,650
And we need to stop him from doing that.

512
00:41:29,819 --> 00:41:31,589
Got it. Let's talk when you come back.

513
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:32,860
Okay.

514
00:41:34,589 --> 00:41:36,729
How should we stop him? Do we need to act ahead of him?

515
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:39,699
Give me a call around 7pm.

516
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:42,330
The alienating solution...

517
00:41:43,299 --> 00:41:44,440
must come to a good end.

518
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:52,838
Here.

519
00:41:52,839 --> 00:41:54,210
You should sit here.

520
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:56,179
Seo Yun should sit next to his dad.

521
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:00,589
Come here.

522
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:04,420
There we go.

523
00:42:06,989 --> 00:42:08,730
It's your favorite. Bulgogi.

524
00:42:13,699 --> 00:42:17,500
Will Kim Young A continue to support us?

525
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,310
We're still in talks.

526
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,310
Are you angry?

527
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:28,080
No. Not at all.

528
00:42:28,350 --> 00:42:29,380
Let's eat.

529
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:33,319
Seo Yun loves bulgogi.

530
00:42:33,989 --> 00:42:35,049
Eat up.

531
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:36,989
I don't like bulgogi.

533
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:50,799
I'm sorry. Just a moment.

534
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,009
Yes, Ms. Kim.

535
00:42:57,610 --> 00:42:58,679
Gong Deukgu?

536
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:01,549
Yes. He was an employee at Chayul.

537
00:43:02,409 --> 00:43:03,420
What?

538
00:43:04,449 --> 00:43:05,819
Chairwoman Cha?

539
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:08,449
I'll check.

540
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:12,719
Thank you for letting me know. Bye.

541
00:43:16,659 --> 00:43:19,159
Did you give Mr. Gong money?

542
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:22,330
What are you talking about?

543
00:43:22,331 --> 00:43:26,170
I heard Mr. Gong got caught gambling abroad.

544
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,810
And the money was from Chayul.

545
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:30,909
Did Ms. Kim say that?

546
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:33,778
It was almost certain that Chayul would win...

547
00:43:33,779 --> 00:43:35,310
the law school deal.

548
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:37,380
But it's about to be on hold now.

549
00:43:40,089 --> 00:43:41,190
Did you give him money?

550
00:43:41,989 --> 00:43:43,249
Why would I give him money?

551
00:43:43,250 --> 00:43:45,659
I just gave him some severance pay as he was quitting.

552
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:48,259
I heard it was two million dollars.

553
00:43:55,929 --> 00:43:57,969
Seo Yun, can you go up to your room for a while?

554
00:44:03,409 --> 00:44:05,009

00:44:13,690 --> 00:44:15,719

- What? - What?

558
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:26,428
I wonder for which one of you the police have come...

559
00:44:26,429 --> 00:44:27,500
to arrest.

560
00:44:27,770 --> 00:44:28,900

- Yes. - What are you doing?

562
00:44:33,199 --> 00:44:34,238
Do you really have to ask?

563
00:44:34,239 --> 00:44:36,139
You already knew that I knew everything.

564
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:40,449
I've had enough of putting on a show.

565
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:43,179

567
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:52,860
Yes, that's me.

568
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:56,360
You're under arrest for instigating Na Yu Mi's murder.

Did you just report me to the police?

572
00:45:04,569 --> 00:45:05,769
Do you think I had Na Yu Mi killed?

573
00:45:05,770 --> 00:45:07,009
Go, and let them investigate then.

574
00:45:07,409 --> 00:45:08,868
I'm sure the police have a plan too.

575
00:45:08,869 --> 00:45:09,869
Please come with us.

581

Yes.

593
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:41,468
I was really curious to see how Noh Yul Seong would react...

594
00:46:41,469 --> 00:46:43,130
when he was framed...

By the way, when I read his statement,

598
00:46:51,580 --> 00:46:54,379
I could understand why the police arrested you,

599
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:55,509
not him.

600
00:46:55,909 --> 00:46:59,179

Don't you know the announce for the law school is next week?

605

to stop you from building a law school or Chayul Town.

This was the perfect timing. Don't be so silly.

Anyway, I hope you won't go down for your son's crimes.

At least I must remain free, so I can help with your trial.

00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:32,599
You should have just scared her.

720
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:34,138
Don't you see that I did this for your sake?

721
00:54:34,139 --> 00:54:35,409
How could you...

722
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:38,710
I'm sure some of you might remember.

723
00:54:38,810 --> 00:54:41,749
This woman, Na Yu Mi, supposedly jumped out of a car...

724
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:43,449
and committed suicide, right?

725
00:54:43,549 --> 00:54:45,319
Gosh. This is bad.

726
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:46,650
On the day of her death,

727
00:54:46,651 --> 00:54:49,250
she barged into the venue of the engagement party.

728
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:52,960
Gosh.

729
00:54:54,830 --> 00:54:58,099
All right. Chairwoman Cha Hui Won is bound to be put away now.

730
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:00,799
Next up is CEO Noh Yul Seong.

731
00:55:07,199 --> 00:55:08,469
This is Na Yu Mi.

732
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:18,819
He also dated her with a promise of marriage.

733
00:55:19,319 --> 00:55:20,380
Just like he did with me.

734
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:23,318
He betrays his lover whenever it is convenient for him.

735
00:55:23,319 --> 00:55:25,719
Then he concealed his mom's crime when she got rid of his lover.

736
00:55:26,159 --> 00:55:28,130
Yet, he wants to be the icon of charity?

737
00:55:28,830 --> 00:55:30,158
If you believe he's doing a good deed,

738
00:55:30,159 --> 00:55:31,528
you're falling for his trick.

739
00:55:31,529 --> 00:55:33,900
- Hey. - Stop her!

740
00:55:36,270 --> 00:55:38,299
- Hey! - Stop taking pictures!

741
00:55:38,699 --> 00:55:40,439
- Hey, turn that off. - Take them out!

742
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:41,868
- Aren't you Mr. Noh Yul Seong? - Gosh.

743
00:55:41,869 --> 00:55:42,869
Is she telling the truth?

744
00:55:43,239 --> 00:55:45,639
Everyone, everything she said is slanderous.

745
00:55:45,739 --> 00:55:48,309
I will send out a statement through my official channel.

746
00:55:48,310 --> 00:55:49,448
Please say something now!

747
00:55:49,449 --> 00:55:51,649
Gosh. Stop taking pictures. Stop that!

748
00:55:51,650 --> 00:55:52,879
- Stop that. - No!

749
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:54,019
- Stop it. - That's not true.

750
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:56,088
- Please give us a comment! - Any comment, sir?

751
00:55:56,089 --> 00:55:57,690
- Hold on. Step back. - That way!

752
00:55:57,989 --> 00:55:58,989
Stop that!

753
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:01,060
- Hurry up! - Stop taking pictures.

754
00:56:01,259 --> 00:56:03,159
- Get the car ready! Hey! - Sir!

755
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:06,000
- You must explain yourself! - Sir!

756
00:56:06,699 --> 00:56:08,270
Come on! Give that to me!

757
00:56:08,830 --> 00:56:11,139
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

758
00:56:11,639 --> 00:56:13,040
A traitor for a traitor.

759
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:15,369
That's totally right up my alley.

760
00:56:15,469 --> 00:56:18,709
Exactly. But you and I really don't mix.

761
00:56:18,710 --> 00:56:21,279
But this is the only thing we see eye to eye on.

762
00:56:22,710 --> 00:56:23,779
Good work.

763
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:26,319
Do you want to go to the next room and have some food?

764
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:28,420
I get the feeling Noh Yul Seong prepared an expensive meal.

765
00:56:37,029 --> 00:56:38,659
- There she comes. - She's out.

766
00:56:39,159 --> 00:56:40,428
Do you admit to murdering the girl?

767
00:56:40,429 --> 00:56:41,769
- A comment, please. - Do you admit to the charge?

768
00:56:41,770 --> 00:56:43,369
- Please answer our question. - Just one question!

769
00:56:43,670 --> 00:56:45,699
This whole thing is fabricated.

770
00:56:49,569 --> 00:56:51,839
Look. How could they arrest me based on a mere suspicion?

771
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:55,349
I've dedicated my entire life to uphold the law and justice.

772
00:56:55,350 --> 00:56:56,350
Yet, this is how they treat someone with my reputation.

773
00:56:56,351 --> 00:56:58,949
I can't imagine how badly regular people must've been mistreated.

774
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:01,549
I will fight to the end...

775
00:57:02,219 --> 00:57:03,989
and prove my innocence.

776
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:09,729
- Then do you deny it? - Are you saying you're not guilty?

777
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:11,158
- So you're denying it? - Ma'am!

778
00:57:11,159 --> 00:57:13,158
- One more question! - Please clarify that!

779
00:57:13,159 --> 00:57:14,569
Are you saying the real culprit is someone else?

780
00:57:14,630 --> 00:57:15,969
- One more comment! - Ma'am!

781
00:57:17,469 --> 00:57:18,499
- One more question! - Please answer our question.

782
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:21,238
- Are you saying you're innocent? - What's the truth?

00:57:21,239 --> 00:57:22,440
Please answer us!

00:57:31,080 --> 00:57:32,080

Hello.

00:58:07,179 --> 00:58:10,350
Can you recognize me, sir?

789
00:58:11,089 --> 00:58:13,520
Honey. You remember the prosecutor, right?

790
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:21,770
My wife...

791
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,639
told me everything.

792
00:58:28,339 --> 00:58:29,469
I'm sorry.

793
00:58:30,139 --> 00:58:31,179
No.

794
00:58:32,339 --> 00:58:33,839
Thank you for waking up.

795
00:58:35,380 --> 00:58:36,380
I mean it.

796
00:58:38,319 --> 00:58:40,519
- I can't believe he survived. - Exactly.

797
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:41,850
That couldn't have been easy.

798
00:58:46,489 --> 00:58:47,489
What happened?

799
00:58:48,190 --> 00:58:49,889
There had been some signs for some days now.

800
00:58:49,989 --> 00:58:51,259
But we heard the news only a while ago.

801
00:58:51,929 --> 00:58:53,629
What about his memory? Can he talk?

802
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:56,199
He's completely back. This is bad.

803
00:58:56,630 --> 00:58:58,500
What's going to happen if Professor Seo starts talking?

804
00:58:59,270 --> 00:59:00,270
Well,

805
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:04,040
we'll be charged with instigating and blackmailing to commit suicide.

806
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:07,480
Hold on.

807
00:59:09,310 --> 00:59:10,350
Who will be charged?

808
00:59:10,449 --> 00:59:11,949
Who do you think? All of us.

00:59:12,049 --> 00:59:13,119
- All of us? - Why?

810
00:59:14,350 --> 00:59:18,259
- Come on. We're not accomplices. - Right.

811
00:59:26,429 --> 00:59:27,500
What are you playing at?

812
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:30,569
At times like this, it's better to clear things up.

813
00:59:30,770 --> 00:59:33,198
It's a fact that you were the one that blackmailed...

814
00:59:33,199 --> 00:59:35,310
- Professor Seo that day. - Yes.

815
00:59:35,540 --> 00:59:36,569
Right.

Look who's talking. How could you show your face around here?

819
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:03,630
It's been a while. Why don't you say hi to him first?

820
01:00:09,210 --> 01:00:11,679
Professor Seo, I can't imagine what you must've gone through.

821
01:00:12,239 --> 01:00:13,409
I have a certain someone to thank.

822
01:00:14,239 --> 01:00:15,250
Right.

823
01:00:18,549 --> 01:00:21,619
Ma'am. This must have been tough on you too.

What's with the camera?

You found dirt on him, kept a secret file on him,

850
01:02:05,290 --> 01:02:06,889
and made him destroy evidence.

851
01:02:07,159 --> 01:02:11,130

You can stop here now.

01:05:51,420 --> 01:05:53,350
You piece of trash. Call him now!

898
01:05:54,380 --> 01:05:56,489
I want you to beg. Beg me to spare your life.

899
01:05:56,790 --> 01:05:59,420
Were you going to kill my mom from the beginning?

900
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:00,520
Kim Sa Ra!

901
01:06:00,521 --> 01:06:01,928
My wish is that...

902
01:06:01,929 --> 01:06:04,029
Seo Yun doesn't turn out like a piece of trash that you are.

903
01:06:04,900 --> 01:06:06,159
This is a goodbye for real now.
