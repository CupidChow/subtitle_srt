Stall a bit.

14
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:28,720
Come back here at dawn, and let her out.

15
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:30,660
Yes, sir.

16
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,899
- Turn the car around. - Pardon?

17
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:45,508

Get on my back.

21
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,059
Gosh. Are you all right?

22
00:02:03,089 --> 00:02:04,728
Can you talk? Say something.

23
00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:06,890
Yes. My voice is still as fine as ever.

24
00:02:09,559 --> 00:02:10,699
Did you get hurt anywhere?

25
00:02:11,569 --> 00:02:12,699
Well,

my handsome face, perhaps.

27
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,009
I don't see any other way.

28

about you.

38
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,930

Okay. Thanks.

00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:27,770
Gosh. It smells great.

52
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:33,239
Okay. Cleanse your throat.

53

This shows why it's important to have a clean breakup with women.

58
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:56,058
You should have bought her an expensive bag...

59
00:04:56,059 --> 00:04:57,399
and then tossed her out.

60
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,600
Or you should have taught her a lesson to keep her quiet.

61
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,899

68
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,330
The plan where we give 5 million dollars to 10 people?

69

I'm against that.

70
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,069
Think about how much we could get...

71
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:42,080
if we were to split the 50 million dollars among us.

72
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:45,580

You said you were going to put up with him.

156

People did that when the average lifespan was 60.

00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:34,580
I had never been slapped in my life.

185
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:36,080
This will be the last time too.

186
00:13:36,619 --> 00:13:38,790
What are the chances of meeting a mother-in-law like her again?

187
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:45,159
Mom. Please stay out of my business.

188
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:47,690
Do you expect me to turn into a fool just like you?

189
00:13:48,259 --> 00:13:50,330
Like a fool who got played and had to pay her alimony?

190
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:53,368
The first thing we must do is to separate the lawyer...

191
00:13:53,369 --> 00:13:55,239
from Kim Sa Ra.

192
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,440
Do you still have feelings for her?

193
00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:03,040
That lawyer is Dong Gi Jun.

194
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:04,909
The prosecutor who handled Professor Seo's case.

195
00:14:05,609 --> 00:14:06,649
The one who jumped off.

196
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:11,580
So what? Why can't the two of them work...

197
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:18,220
You're the reason.

198
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:23,759
Gosh. Come on.

199
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,600
You know,

200
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:32,469
I got a divorce and remarried just like you told me to.

201
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:34,909
But look at me now.

202
00:14:35,979 --> 00:14:38,850
Look at the situation I'm in right now. It's a mess.

203
00:14:44,619 --> 00:14:46,690
I'll do it my way starting now.

204
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:50,859
Are you saying it's my fault?

205
00:14:59,029 --> 00:15:01,470
My husband tumbled off the wheelchair again.

206
00:15:01,899 --> 00:15:03,169
He was trying to move on his own...

207
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:04,999
because he didn't want to burden me.

208
00:15:05,869 --> 00:15:08,440
Honey, you must call me next time. Okay?

209
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:10,109
Okay. I will.

210
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:11,279
How do I look today?

211
00:15:11,379 --> 00:15:12,379
You look beautiful.

212
00:15:13,149 --> 00:15:15,979
The case involves the couple, Kang Chul and Choi La Hee.

213
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,888
The husband got into Harvard University in the US.

214
00:15:18,889 --> 00:15:20,748
He was paralysed from the waist down in a car accident.

215
00:15:20,749 --> 00:15:21,988
But he established his business with determination...

216
00:15:21,989 --> 00:15:23,290
and became a successful entrepreneur.

217
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:26,430
His wife is a streamer.

218
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:28,559
She posts videos of their day-to-day lives.

219
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,200
She mostly uploads videos about how she takes care of her husband.

220
00:15:31,769 --> 00:15:34,399
They met on a reality dating show.

221
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,940
They were interested in each other from the first meeting.

222
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,869
They got married in four months.

223
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:42,180
But why does she want a divorce? Is their marriage for show?

224
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,709
Right after they got married,

225
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:46,050
the wife had been a victim of his jealous delusion.

226
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:48,949
The husband feels wrongfully accused and doesn't want a divorce.

227
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:52,749
Gosh. I'm sorry I'm late.

228
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:58,090
(Kang Chul, Choi La Hee)

229
00:15:59,259 --> 00:16:01,628
Is the client the husband or the wife?

230
00:16:01,629 --> 00:16:03,830
- The wife. - Will we take on this case?

231
00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:06,700
I plan to meet with her. Why?

232
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:10,100
Hello.

233
00:16:20,609 --> 00:16:23,050
Hello, Lawyer Dong.

234
00:16:24,619 --> 00:16:26,119
Hello.

235
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:29,489
Hello. I'm the team leader of SOLUTION. My name is Kim Sa Ra.

236
00:16:55,779 --> 00:16:58,379
How does your husband usually suspect your infidelity?

237
00:17:00,749 --> 00:17:04,320
He watches my every move with his eyes peeled.

238
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:09,899
You've never...

239
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,199
experienced that before, right?

240
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,070
You don't know how it feels unless you've been a victim of it.

241
00:17:32,419 --> 00:17:34,590
Did you install this yourself?

242
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:41,030
What's that?

243
00:17:42,859 --> 00:17:44,199
It's a location tracker.

244
00:17:46,169 --> 00:17:48,540
Gosh. What's this doing on my car?

245
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,570
Ask your husband.

246
00:17:51,169 --> 00:17:53,209
He gets so insecure even when he gives me my allowance...

247
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:55,639
in case I spend it to cheat on him.

248
00:17:56,709 --> 00:17:59,649
Can I ask how much you get as your allowance?

249
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,080
Without the living expenses, he gives me 5,000 dollars.

250
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:04,449
Isn't that awful?

251
00:18:05,719 --> 00:18:09,560
He doesn't understand that I need money to keep up appearances.

252
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:11,290
Can't this be grounds for a divorce?

253
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,790
No.

254
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,199
Then what else?

255
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,668
Right. Sometimes, he inspects my socks in the laundry hamper.

256
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:24,369
Why does he inspect your socks?

257
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:28,339
If I were to put them back again after taking them off when I'm out,

258
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,340
he would be able to tell.

259
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:31,780
Because of the heels.

260
00:18:32,609 --> 00:18:33,679
You could tell?

261
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,080
Is that true?

262
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:38,850
I see. It does leave a trace.

263
00:18:41,189 --> 00:18:43,189
I guess 5,000 dollars isn't enough for someone.

264
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,590
That handbag alone is 40,000 dollars.

265
00:18:45,689 --> 00:18:46,689
No way.

266
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:49,300
It's amazing that you know the price just by looking at it.

267
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:54,500
So when did your husband start suspecting you?

268
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,310
It's because of you, Lawyer Dong.

269
00:19:01,469 --> 00:19:02,480
Lawyer Dong...

270
00:19:03,439 --> 00:19:04,439
Me?

271
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,449
Do you guys know each other?

272
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:12,719
I see. You didn't know.

273
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:15,689
We were in a serious relationship before.

274
00:19:15,859 --> 00:19:18,589
Gosh. It wasn't a serious relationship.

275
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,590
Let me explain.

276
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:22,000
My husband saw an old photo of Gi Jun and me together.

277
00:19:23,399 --> 00:19:26,030
I had no idea that it was on my computer.

278
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,698
So will this problem be solved...

279
00:19:29,699 --> 00:19:32,510
if I tell your husband that nothing is going on?

280
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,919
Can I talk to Lawyer Dong for a moment?

281
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:49,260
Of course.

282
00:20:12,879 --> 00:20:14,780
How long has it been since our breakup?

283
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,419
About four years?

284
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:21,449
You know, it's not too late to withdraw your request from us.

285
00:20:22,659 --> 00:20:23,659
Why would I do that?

286
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:28,530
Did you come here on purpose?

287
00:20:32,469 --> 00:20:33,530
Of course.

288
00:20:35,899 --> 00:20:37,600
Can you take this case?

289
00:20:37,939 --> 00:20:41,409
I don't want to tell other people about my pathetic married life.

290
00:20:46,050 --> 00:20:47,148
But still. This is...

291
00:20:47,149 --> 00:20:48,250
Are you worried about your girlfriend?

292
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,849
- Who? - If not,

293
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,850
why can't you take my case? Please?

294
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:56,760
No. You haven't changed one bit.

295
00:20:57,159 --> 00:20:58,688
Nothing is predictable with you.

296
00:20:58,689 --> 00:21:00,189
Isn't that the charm you fell for?

297
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,290
(Latheteresa)

298
00:21:33,830 --> 00:21:34,830
(Everything about splits)

299
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,070
Gosh. You startled me.

300
00:21:43,669 --> 00:21:46,139
My talk with Gi Jun ran slightly longer than expected.

301
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,209
Can I get a cup of coffee before I go?

302
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:25,280
But you know why Gi Jun came here, right?

303
00:22:27,550 --> 00:22:28,580
Did Lawyer Dong...

304
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:32,919
- say something? - Oh, my. You don't know.

305
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:37,119
Don't worry about it. I'll take this to go.

306
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,709
We just briefly met.

307
00:22:58,209 --> 00:22:59,310
We just brushed past each other.

308
00:22:59,949 --> 00:23:01,010
Right.

309
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:03,219
Well, it's not like...

310
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,919
I would not have met anyone up until now.

311
00:23:06,689 --> 00:23:07,750
Did I say anything?

312
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,590
So...

313
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:15,359
how was La Hee usually like?

314
00:23:16,899 --> 00:23:18,969
I'd say she has a daring charm.

315
00:23:20,469 --> 00:23:23,669
Or should I say she does things however she wants?

316
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,169
I don't really remember, to be honest.

317
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:31,079
How many girls have you met...

318
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,139
for you not to remember?

319
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,050
I don't remember anyone else except Kim Sa Ra.

320
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,250
Gosh.

321
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,359
Should we...

322
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:45,260
give up on Choi La Hee?

323
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,060
- It must be uncomfortable for you. - No.

324
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:50,128
I'm totally fine with her.

325
00:23:50,129 --> 00:23:52,100
I'm worried you might feel uncomfortable about it.

326
00:23:52,899 --> 00:23:55,699
It's hard to grasp what is to come with her as our client too.

327
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:01,368
But she wants help from someone she knows.

328
00:24:01,369 --> 00:24:02,379
She asked for my help.

329
00:24:04,939 --> 00:24:06,050
Oh, right.

330
00:24:06,750 --> 00:24:09,350
If my partner wants to help, I must do it.

331
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:11,819
Don't worry too much about the two of us.

332
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,850
Never.

333
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:17,859
I get it.

334
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:22,359
Why would I do that?

335
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:24,199
Right. I get it.

336
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,149
It's cold.

337
00:24:43,449 --> 00:24:44,479
It's cold indeed.

338
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,989
Today, my husband, CEO Kang...

339
00:24:46,990 --> 00:24:48,718
got a burn on his hand.

340
00:24:48,719 --> 00:24:51,259
Take a look at this. It looks painful, doesn't it?

341
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:53,858
For now, we've cooled it down with some cold water.

342
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:55,799
It has blistered up now.

343
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,759
- It stings, doesn't it? - Yes. It stings a bit.

344
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,628
We're going to use this bandage.

345
00:24:59,629 --> 00:25:01,600
It has a cooling effect.

346
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:04,669
She was the one that wanted a divorce, right?

347
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:08,939
There was a video with a cut on the forehead a few days ago.

348
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,408
Now, it's a burn?

349
00:25:10,409 --> 00:25:12,208
The injuries happen too often.

350
00:25:12,209 --> 00:25:14,649
The treatment videos come up twice a week.

351
00:25:14,879 --> 00:25:16,879
He gets hurt every 3 to 4 days?

352
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,779
This doesn't make any sense.

353
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:19,819
Does this look normal?

354
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,319
(- I'd love a wife like her. - I'm always rooting for you.)

355
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,520
(- He got hurt again. - Oh, no. A burn?)

356
00:25:24,719 --> 00:25:25,859
(Choi La Hee)

357
00:25:33,429 --> 00:25:34,500
Answer it.

358
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,040
Okay.

359
00:25:37,041 --> 00:25:38,070
(Answer call)

360
00:25:38,869 --> 00:25:39,869
Hey.

361
00:25:40,139 --> 00:25:42,139
I knew you'd still use this number.

362
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,879
Shall we have dinner tonight?

363
00:25:45,209 --> 00:25:49,178
I'll call you back.

(Choi La Hee)

365
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:57,519
Please refrain from personal calls with the client.

366
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,230
Oh, of course.

367
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:09,239
Oh, hello.

368
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,600
- Take a seat. - Thanks.

369
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,040
Goodness.

370
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,979
We won't be getting a divorce.

371
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:18,939
Your wife contacted us.

372
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:22,449
She behaves this way whenever she feels upset at me.

373
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,149
Did you see our show yesterday?

374
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:26,550
Did we look like people who wanted a divorce?

375
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,888
I'm sorry,

376
00:26:32,889 --> 00:26:36,330
but have you ever seen me? Or it could have been a photo.

377
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,129
No. Have we met before?

378
00:26:43,399 --> 00:26:46,070
My husband saw an old photo of Gi Jun and me together.

379
00:26:46,209 --> 00:26:47,570
What is it that you want to know?

380
00:26:48,209 --> 00:26:51,040
Has she mentioned anything about delusional jealousy?

381
00:26:54,109 --> 00:26:56,350
My wife will do anything for views.

382
00:26:57,280 --> 00:27:00,949
She has a meal with the biggest donator every week.

383
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:03,320
I found that suspicious for a while.

384
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:05,658
Don't you know there are weird rumours about you?

385
00:27:05,659 --> 00:27:06,830
You believe all that gossip?

386
00:27:11,659 --> 00:27:15,070
If you just trust me, everything will be fine.

387
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,839
I found out it wasn't true,

388
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,139
and that was the end of it.

389
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:23,010
How did you get that burn?

390
00:27:23,209 --> 00:27:24,480
I'm really sorry,

391
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:27,310
but is that burn real?

392
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:32,820
Gosh.

393
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:35,418
Four days ago, you hurt your forehead.

394
00:27:35,419 --> 00:27:37,188
Last week, you hurt your ankle.

395
00:27:37,189 --> 00:27:38,919
And before that, you hurt your finger.

396
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:42,260
You get yourself hurt quite often.

397
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,468
I move around a lot although it's hard for me to.

398
00:27:47,469 --> 00:27:48,500
That is why I get hurt often.

399
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,780
The husband or wife. Who do you think is lying?

400
00:27:58,179 --> 00:27:59,179
Do you think it's Choi La Hee?

401
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:02,449
Well, she lied about the photo.

402
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:05,020
Does she have other feelings for you?

403
00:28:07,719 --> 00:28:09,759
I guess things are possible if they get a divorce.

404
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:10,790
My gosh.

405
00:28:10,959 --> 00:28:13,959
You're walking in seven-league boots with your imagination.

406
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:17,530
Why are you two here?

407
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,969
You met my husband without telling me?

408
00:28:27,109 --> 00:28:29,639
Gi Jun, are you doubting me?

409
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:32,080
I just wanted to make things clear.

410
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:34,209
That was why.

411
00:28:36,449 --> 00:28:37,449
Let's go.

412
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:39,449
I have something to tell you!

413
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:50,399
You may take your time.

414
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:52,830
I'll get a cab.

415
00:29:23,199 --> 00:29:24,959
What are you doing?

416
00:29:25,629 --> 00:29:27,830
What's wrong with you?

417
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,310
Shall we spend some time together?

418
00:29:34,469 --> 00:29:35,469
No, thanks.

419
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:38,780
Ms. Choi La Hee, you're my client.

420
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:40,280
If you keep this going...

421
00:29:40,909 --> 00:29:43,079
I was just joking.

422
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,780
Why have you become so lame? I was just making a joke.

423
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:48,919
Get back to parking your car. I'm off.

424
00:29:49,719 --> 00:29:51,090
Gosh.

425
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:12,649
I told you it wouldn't work on someone like him.

426
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:15,080
Gosh. I want 30 percent more added to the contract.

427
00:30:15,409 --> 00:30:18,149
My head hurts from all this, and I don't even want a divorce!

428
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,820
Did I tell you to get a divorce?

429
00:30:19,949 --> 00:30:21,819
Just get them away from each other while meeting them.

430
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,888
Is it that hard for you?

431
00:30:22,889 --> 00:30:24,789
Gosh, you scared me. Who are you?

432
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:27,189
Let's go with 20 percent more. That's all I'll offer.

433

But you have to sleep with Dong Gi Jun.

434

- Hey. - Hey, listen up.

439
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:04,158
Lawyer Dong got calls from three other law firms.

440
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:06,599
He gave all of them up to work with you.

441

442
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,368
there's something he wants from you.

- Remains in my heart - Want what? I'm hanging up.

00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:22,108
But you know why Gi Jun came here, right?

446
00:31:22,109 --> 00:31:24,250
Oh, my. You don't know.

447
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,429
I'm not here as a client.

448
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:42,300
So don't be so harsh on me.

449
00:31:43,469 --> 00:31:45,199
You're drunk. Let's talk tomorrow.

450

when things don't go her way.

461
00:32:39,659 --> 00:32:40,830
She would get angry.

462

00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,959
Is this what you want?

470
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:39,990
I'm sorry, but it's a no for me.

471
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,020

Gi Jun, it's me, Choi La Hee!

473

It's a no because you're Choi La Hee! Get it?

Get out.

480
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:27,569

Gosh. She has quite a story too.

Of course. Don't mind me.

It could be an invasion of privacy.

543
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,069
Just because it's a family issue,

544
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:57,040
many misfortunes get suppressed.

545
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:01,409
Do you think that's okay?

546
00:39:05,779 --> 00:39:07,980
Let's start with the Munchausen syndrome.

547
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:10,920
Let's find out if this is a real issue with them.

548
00:39:17,889 --> 00:39:19,560
I just won't get a divorce.

549
00:39:19,759 --> 00:39:22,429
"Just?" Is getting a divorce some kind of game?

550
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,399
Then get a divorce.

551
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,068
Let's talk. Where are you going?

552
00:39:29,069 --> 00:39:30,069
What are you grabbing at?

553
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,540
Oh, gosh! Do you know how much this is?

554
00:39:34,869 --> 00:39:36,540
My baby!

555
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:41,949
We're at the door.

556
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:44,580
Yes. It would be great if you could spare some time.

557
00:39:46,449 --> 00:39:47,449
Sorry?

558
00:39:58,159 --> 00:40:00,029
- Are you okay? - Yes. I'm okay.

559
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:04,969
I apologize. It's my secretary's day off.

560
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:12,809
I did a brief research. The purses and bracelets...

561
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:14,310
were all worth around 10,000 dollars.

562
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:18,679
How much does she make with her Internet shows?

563
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:21,420
It's nowhere near to get her those things.

564
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:26,489
May I ask you two for help?

565
00:40:27,389 --> 00:40:29,900
Please confirm one thing with us first.

566
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:34,830
Has your wife ever hurt you on purpose...

567
00:40:36,429 --> 00:40:38,239
or used violence on you?

568
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:42,239
That has never happened.

569
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:47,209
That makes no sense. He's just used to violence.

570
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:49,710
She left her husband on the floor.

571
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:52,580
It's a problem that he's keeping everything to himself.

572
00:40:55,589 --> 00:40:58,819
And about that high-end purse.

573
00:40:59,219 --> 00:41:01,360
I was told it wasn't sold to just anyone.

574
00:41:07,869 --> 00:41:12,500
It's a purse that's sold to those who have spent over 100,000 dollars.

575
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:16,440
That won't be enough with the money she gets.

576
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:18,908
Having a meal with the biggest donator.

577
00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:19,909
It's still going on.

578
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,480
A sponsor?

579
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:25,178
These are the products used to take care of CEO Kang.

Ta-Da!

582
00:41:29,319 --> 00:41:30,319
So this is...

583
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:35,028
You have to beat Supercar98 to win a meal.

584
00:41:35,029 --> 00:41:37,130

585
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,560
I love you!

586
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:43,770
You're the strongest contender for the meal! My gosh!

587
00:41:44,799 --> 00:41:47,069
It's to focus better.

588
00:41:47,270 --> 00:41:48,270
Focus.

589
00:41:49,369 --> 00:41:50,380
Focus.

590
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,080
Here's one for you to focus, Ms. Kim.

591
00:41:53,949 --> 00:41:55,310
- Can you see this? - Focus.

592
00:41:55,949 --> 00:41:57,179
- Let's do this. - All right.

- It's over our budget. - How much do you need?

604
00:43:06,619 --> 00:43:09,650
Oh, no. We need a time-out.

605
00:43:09,819 --> 00:43:12,659
Come on. Don't you know my motto?

Hold on.

617

Always look intelligent.

618
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:22,529
Become a fool in front of a woman.

619
00:44:22,989 --> 00:44:25,529
You know I'm the worst at those two things.

620

Don't shake your legs when you're sitting.

622

Hi.

Don't try to cut the steak with force, but try to slice it well.

625

Don't smile. You look like a fool.

626
00:44:58,429 --> 00:45:00,730
No, Dae Gi. You look cute when you smile.

627
00:45:04,799 --> 00:45:05,839
But...

628
00:45:07,469 --> 00:45:09,069
have we seen each other before?

629
00:45:13,009 --> 00:45:16,920
I don't have such a common face.

630
00:45:17,279 --> 00:45:18,580
I feel disappointed.

Yes? Start what?

634
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:42,369
A fun game.

635
00:45:43,239 --> 00:45:46,239
Let's call this a blank check.

636
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:48,849

Write whatever you want.

638
00:45:50,779 --> 00:45:52,080
Then, I'll...

639
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:55,750
write the amount.

Yes. According to our research.

643
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,469
After the accident, my family and friends...

644
00:46:16,369 --> 00:46:19,480
have always been afraid that I might be discouraged.

645
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:23,349
How disappointing would it be for them to know that I have...

646
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:24,619
such a ridiculous married life?

647
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:27,619
Do not give up on your life...

648
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:30,049
just to consider others' perspectives and positions.

649
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:32,789
Would this have happened...

650
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:34,630
even if I was healthy?

651
00:46:37,029 --> 00:46:39,230
She'd have been the same even if I were her husband.

652
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:41,469
It's not your fault.

(Photos and details of the injury)

654
00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:52,380
Both of your suspicions were correct.

655
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:55,250
She hurt me to film the video.

656
00:46:55,509 --> 00:46:57,319
She's obsessed with the number of views.

657
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,119
If I refuse, she makes a fuss about filing for divorce.

658
00:47:03,089 --> 00:47:06,690
I wish you to file for divorce.

659
00:47:07,830 --> 00:47:10,258
Whether to forgive your wife's privacy...

660
00:47:10,259 --> 00:47:12,000
is your choice,

661
00:47:12,199 --> 00:47:13,330
but violence is not.

662
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:15,929
We can't let this slip.

663
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:21,270
I'll make sure you get compensated for all the unfairness.

664
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:23,310
I didn't want to divorce.

665
00:47:24,279 --> 00:47:26,779
I wanted to show everyone that I'm living a happy life.

666
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:36,549
I truly understand...

667
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:38,860
how you feel.

668
00:47:41,029 --> 00:47:42,290
Don't be afraid.

669
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,929
It's fine to be divorced.

670
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:48,830
Even if you get divorced, the world won't collapse.

671
00:48:10,790 --> 00:48:11,889
I admit it.

672
00:48:12,589 --> 00:48:14,630
Not everything about family matters is private.

673
00:48:17,799 --> 00:48:19,130
Why do you think CEO Kang...

674
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:22,000
endured until now?

675
00:48:24,299 --> 00:48:25,339
I'm not sure.

676
00:48:25,739 --> 00:48:28,239
He has a sufficient career,

677
00:48:28,670 --> 00:48:30,139
wealth, and fame.

678
00:48:34,610 --> 00:48:36,049
If he just stays quiet,

679
00:48:36,610 --> 00:48:39,049
he can become someone without problems.

680
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:54,730
I was like him when I was married.

681
00:48:56,630 --> 00:48:58,639
I wanted to look fine externally.

682
00:49:03,069 --> 00:49:05,739
So I felt more drawn to him.

683
00:49:05,940 --> 00:49:07,750
Since it felt like looking at my past.

684
00:49:13,949 --> 00:49:18,319
Gosh. I knew everything about you in the past.

685
00:49:20,989 --> 00:49:22,730
Why don't you know much about La Hee?

686
00:49:25,860 --> 00:49:26,900
Shall we eat ramyeon now?

687
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:36,469
Why is it so mushy and soggy?

688
00:49:37,610 --> 00:49:40,549
La Hee's eyes will turn like that tomorrow, right?

689
00:49:40,679 --> 00:49:41,909
Being so furious.

690
00:49:42,909 --> 00:49:44,350
She should be punished for what she has done.

691
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:49,449
In the most her-like way possible.

692
00:49:55,330 --> 00:49:57,089

- Oh, my goodness. - It's amazing.

- Cheers. - Cheers.

00:50:24,659 --> 00:50:26,318
Thank you.

700
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:27,389
Look at her husband.

701
00:50:27,529 --> 00:50:28,860
Thank you all for coming.

702
00:50:29,389 --> 00:50:31,659
- Congratulations! - Thank you for coming.

703
00:50:33,159 --> 00:50:36,100
Oh, my goodness. Isn't this dress from Andres Gang?

704
00:50:36,969 --> 00:50:38,600
Yes, that's the dress.

705
00:50:39,969 --> 00:50:42,908
My husband sent a person to Paris to get it for me.

706
00:50:42,909 --> 00:50:44,678
He's amazing.

707
00:50:44,679 --> 00:50:45,940
It's so pretty.

708
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:48,110
My goodness.

709
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:04,029
Isn't she wearing a limited edition?

710
00:51:16,770 --> 00:51:18,380
Where did you get your bag and bracelet from?

711
00:51:20,909 --> 00:51:21,909
Answer me!

712
00:51:23,179 --> 00:51:24,250
Honey.

713
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:26,580
Honey.

714
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:30,689
Shall we renew our vows for our third anniversary?

715
00:51:30,690 --> 00:51:31,988
Don't change the topic.

716
00:51:31,989 --> 00:51:34,059
Let me increase the view counts.

717
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:35,289
It's my wish...

718
00:51:35,290 --> 00:51:36,959
to hit 100,000 views.

719
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:39,928
- That many people won't view it. - We can do noise marketing.

720
00:51:39,929 --> 00:51:41,999
You have that blind date rumour.

721
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,068
You see, people say I'm not only eating.

722
00:51:45,069 --> 00:51:46,599
They say my private life is complicated.

723
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:50,069
Because of that, the happiest day of my life...

724
00:51:50,469 --> 00:51:53,238
turns into such a miserable ordeal.

725
00:51:53,239 --> 00:51:56,250
And then it ends dramatically and romantically.

726
00:51:58,679 --> 00:52:01,049
We'll hit 100,000 views.

727
00:52:01,790 --> 00:52:03,489
How does it sound? You're on it, right?

728
00:52:04,420 --> 00:52:06,219
Renewing vows sounds good.

729
00:52:07,489 --> 00:52:10,698
You should offer to get it ready from A to Z.

730
00:52:10,699 --> 00:52:12,928
She even wants to cast actors who can play troublemakers.

731
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:14,528
There's one subscriber who ended up getting a divorce...

732
00:52:14,529 --> 00:52:15,900
because he sponsored her.

733
00:52:16,869 --> 00:52:17,940
I see.

734
00:52:19,569 --> 00:52:20,770
Let's invite the wife.

735
00:52:21,969 --> 00:52:24,710
Are we making a documentary instead of a show?

736
00:52:24,839 --> 00:52:25,909
The solution for this time...

737
00:52:28,009 --> 00:52:29,049
is GCOS.

738
00:52:29,350 --> 00:52:32,049
Getting caught up in one's own schemes.

739
00:52:34,449 --> 00:52:35,489
Oh, my.

740
00:52:35,850 --> 00:52:37,119
Where's Choi La Hee?

741
00:52:37,420 --> 00:52:38,489
What's going on?

742
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:40,559
Come out, mistress!

743
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:42,659
Good. Make it more chaotic!

744
00:52:43,429 --> 00:52:44,429
My husband...

745
00:52:46,799 --> 00:52:49,400
- Honey, is she one of the actors? - Come out!

746
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:52,339
This feels so real.

747
00:52:52,799 --> 00:52:54,139
She's there!

748
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:58,940
What?

749
00:52:59,679 --> 00:53:00,750
- Oh, my! - My goodness!

750
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:06,619
- Hey! - My hair!

751
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:09,249
- Hey! It really hurts! - It hurts!

752
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:10,589
- Hey! - Hey!

753
00:53:10,790 --> 00:53:12,759
- Make it pitiful. - Pitiful?

754
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:16,159
- Oh, my goodness. - You...

755
00:53:19,159 --> 00:53:20,360
- My goodness. - Excuse me.

756
00:53:20,529 --> 00:53:21,630
She's running away.

757
00:53:22,130 --> 00:53:23,799
It hurts so much.

758
00:53:23,929 --> 00:53:26,839
It feels so real.

759
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:34,409
Come on.

760
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:38,480
How's the view count?

761
00:53:39,380 --> 00:53:40,380
It's 80,000 views.

762
00:53:41,290 --> 00:53:43,649
Good. Now it's your turn.

763
00:53:43,650 --> 00:53:46,319
Tell them you always brought me to your blind dates...

764
00:53:46,619 --> 00:53:48,060
and that you love me, okay?

765
00:53:49,589 --> 00:53:50,659
What are waiting for?

766
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:52,500
For goodness' sake.

767
00:53:52,699 --> 00:53:54,199
- Is she okay? - Really?

768
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:57,440
Testing.

769
00:53:58,969 --> 00:54:00,710
You're all so mean.

770
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:03,239
My husband worked so hard for today.

771
00:54:06,739 --> 00:54:08,349
Are you recording this?

772
00:54:08,350 --> 00:54:09,350
Honey.

773
00:54:21,259 --> 00:54:24,459
I planned this party because I had...

774
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:25,730
something to say to my wife.

775
00:54:27,230 --> 00:54:30,029
Could you do me a favour, please?

776
00:54:30,770 --> 00:54:32,469
I hope you do.

777
00:54:32,569 --> 00:54:33,569
Of course.

778
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:37,980
I can do any of your favours.

779
00:54:38,239 --> 00:54:40,779
- Oh, my goodness. - Gosh. It's so sweet.

780
00:54:42,650 --> 00:54:44,218
- Divorce me. - Yes.

781
00:54:44,219 --> 00:54:45,420
- Divorce? - Divorce?

782
00:54:45,779 --> 00:54:47,850
- Suddenly a divorce? - Why?

783
00:54:48,489 --> 00:54:50,420
- What did you say? - We'll reach 100,000 views!

784
00:54:55,529 --> 00:54:57,960
You must be happy to have high view counts.

785
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:01,569
- View counts? - View counts?

786
00:55:03,469 --> 00:55:05,540
You! You little...

787
00:55:06,069 --> 00:55:07,509
For goodness' sake!

788
00:55:09,170 --> 00:55:10,210
Gosh!

789
00:55:11,179 --> 00:55:12,210
Kill me.

790
00:55:13,009 --> 00:55:15,110
Do you want to be a boiled chicken?

791
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:17,750
Put it down!

792
00:55:18,449 --> 00:55:20,020
You're the worst!

793
00:55:24,819 --> 00:55:26,259
Who are you?

794
00:55:30,830 --> 00:55:32,960
When I see boiling water, my blood boils.

795
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:35,900
You crazy wench!

796
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:47,139
You should be thankful that you didn't turn into a boiled chicken.

797
00:55:47,339 --> 00:55:48,350
You...

798
00:55:55,319 --> 00:55:56,389
- Oh, my. - My goodness.

799
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,060
- Record it. - Oh, gosh.

800
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:01,089
- This is crazy. - My goodness.

801
00:56:09,600 --> 00:56:11,468
You're getting arrested for domestic violence...

802
00:56:11,469 --> 00:56:12,469
and violation of the Disabled Welfare Act.

803
00:56:13,139 --> 00:56:14,709
Did you scheme all this?

804
00:56:14,710 --> 00:56:16,310
You have the right to have an attorney.

805
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:18,710
You'll have a chance to explain yourself.

806
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:21,750
You have the right to have an attorney and a chance to explain.

807
00:56:22,779 --> 00:56:24,150
- Then you can... - I decline.

808
00:56:24,619 --> 00:56:26,350
I'm not going to defend you.

809
00:56:27,819 --> 00:56:30,819
Honey! This isn't right!

810
00:56:30,989 --> 00:56:33,659
Honey, can you live without me with your legs like that?

811
00:56:38,759 --> 00:56:40,029
Shall we stop here?

812
00:56:46,239 --> 00:56:47,940
I planned this divorce party with so much effort.

813
00:56:54,509 --> 00:56:57,949
Shall we enjoy the party now?

814
00:57:02,389 --> 00:57:03,420
Oh, my goodness.

815
00:57:08,830 --> 00:57:09,830
Here.

816
00:57:16,569 --> 00:57:17,569
Kang Bom!

817
00:57:18,270 --> 00:57:20,239
You were so excited for this solution.

818
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:30,449
What's with that burn?

819
00:57:30,850 --> 00:57:32,250
I got this scar...

820
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:35,319
while I was trying to block my dad who tried to boil my mom.

821
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:37,420
What?

822
00:57:39,060 --> 00:57:41,330
The reason why I follow Ms. Kim around...

823
00:57:42,130 --> 00:57:43,389
is to get rid of bad partners.

824
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:47,460
Let's enjoy the party!

825
00:57:48,670 --> 00:57:49,929
Yes, sure.

826
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:03,750
I want to get a florist certificate.

827
00:58:04,179 --> 00:58:07,279
I heard I needed experience, so I'm doing a part-time job.

828
00:58:08,650 --> 00:58:10,020
It's nice to see you happy.

829
00:58:10,489 --> 00:58:12,560
Maybe it's because it's my first time to earn money myself.

830
00:58:13,489 --> 00:58:15,560
Thanks to you, Sa Ra.

831
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:21,900
Can I call you Sa Ra?

832
00:58:24,069 --> 00:58:25,170
You can.

833
00:58:28,569 --> 00:58:29,639
Sure.

834
00:58:31,509 --> 00:58:33,409
To celebrate us being friends,

835
00:58:33,610 --> 00:58:35,509
I have something to give you.

836
00:58:37,650 --> 00:58:38,679
What is it?

837
00:58:41,549 --> 00:58:43,819
They are documents about my husband.

838
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:47,089
No, my ex-husband's that my father kept.

839
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:50,489
Maybe these could be helpful...

840
00:58:50,889 --> 00:58:52,259
to win back Seo Yun.

841
00:58:54,130 --> 00:58:57,500
This is very unexpected. Thank you so much.

842
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:07,579
The Judiciary Committee members' stance...

843
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:08,948
clearly changed after we bribed them.

844
00:59:08,949 --> 00:59:12,150
The Law School Act bill will pass next week.

845
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:17,520
Are you sure?

846
00:59:17,521 --> 00:59:19,319
We should've done this from the start.

847
00:59:19,790 --> 00:59:21,888
You went through so much trouble.

848
00:59:21,889 --> 00:59:24,659
This is the last thing I can buy with money.

849
00:59:25,330 --> 00:59:26,699
It's impossible for the National Assembly.

850
00:59:27,299 --> 00:59:29,699
If you were a member of the National Assembly,

851
00:59:30,170 --> 00:59:33,339
we would've been able to do something with the plenary.

852
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:34,469
I know, right?

853
00:59:35,310 --> 00:59:36,509
Anyway, thanks for your efforts.

854
00:59:36,610 --> 00:59:40,408
Let's make a plan again.

855
00:59:40,409 --> 00:59:41,710
- Yes, sir! - Okay.

856
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:46,580
I think you need to see this.

857
00:59:48,190 --> 00:59:49,318
Let's see.

858
00:59:49,319 --> 00:59:51,860
("Kang Chul and Choi La Hee are Divorcing, Ending Their Love")

859
00:59:57,159 --> 00:59:59,060
Kim Sa Ra and Dong Gi Jun...

860
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:03,669
will be closer with this exciting news.

861
01:00:03,670 --> 01:00:04,670
Right? That's what this means.

862
01:00:05,339 --> 01:00:06,540
Yes, you're right.

863
01:00:07,670 --> 01:00:08,739
Get out.

864
01:00:09,639 --> 01:00:10,639
Yes, sir.

865
01:00:29,560 --> 01:00:31,799
Gi Jun is using you.

866
01:00:32,159 --> 01:00:34,258
Why do you think he's next to you?

867
01:00:34,259 --> 01:00:35,770
Stop driving a wedge between us.

868
01:00:37,699 --> 01:00:41,170
Seo Woong Jin... Never mind. Let's meet.

869
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:43,209
I'll tell you why he can't be trusted.

870
01:00:43,210 --> 01:00:45,908
No. Apologize first for assuming wrongly...

871
01:00:45,909 --> 01:00:47,139
about Choi La Hee.

872
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:52,049
Why is he so anxious?

873
01:00:55,190 --> 01:00:56,190
Seo Woong Jin?

874
01:00:59,089 --> 01:01:00,119
Professor Seo?

01:01:13,339 --> 01:01:15,610
Chayul Town Promotion Team?

881
01:01:18,040 --> 01:01:20,440
So what is Chayul Town Promotion Team about?

882
01:01:20,810 --> 01:01:23,750
They have five members. They're called five-member society.

883
01:01:23,949 --> 01:01:25,678
They'd get the permission to build a law school...

884
01:01:25,679 --> 01:01:27,420
through an all-around lobbying,

885
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:29,250
then develop the area at a cheap price...

886
01:01:29,549 --> 01:01:31,790
under the guise of an educational project.

887
01:01:32,589 --> 01:01:34,759
I heard they were making a billion dollars from ten million dollars.

888
01:01:35,659 --> 01:01:36,929
Why is it called a five-member society?

889
01:01:37,330 --> 01:01:39,059
I saw only four members in the document.

890
01:01:39,060 --> 01:01:40,759
You'll get goosebumps here.

891
01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:43,429
There was one more member.

892
01:01:44,670 --> 01:01:46,900
Was it Seo Woong Jin?

893
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,040
Bingo!

894
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:50,869

900
01:02:25,610 --> 01:02:28,679
What was he being investigated for?

901
01:02:29,210 --> 01:02:30,908
His assistant died,

902
01:02:30,909 --> 01:02:33,080
but he was the last one who called. Why do you ask?

903
01:02:34,380 --> 01:02:38,190
Have you heard of the five-member society while investigating?

904
01:02:38,989 --> 01:02:41,489
A five-member society? What is that?

905
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:46,799
That's how Seo Woong Jin and Noh Yul Seong knew each other.

906
01:02:48,569 --> 01:02:50,670
Did you know that they knew each other?

907
01:02:51,299 --> 01:02:52,469
Well,

908
01:02:53,469 --> 01:02:54,939
I just had a hint since it was a case...

909
01:02:54,940 --> 01:02:56,610
that I was investigating.

910
01:03:02,810 --> 01:03:03,810
Why?

911
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:07,449
(Reduced sentence for serial killer)

912
01:03:08,790 --> 01:03:09,988
(Chayul Law Firm and Chayul Town Promotion Team)

913
01:03:09,989 --> 01:03:10,989
(Seo Woong Jin is the last person Na Yu Mi talked with.)

914
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:13,319
It seems you've been keeping an eye on this case.

915
01:03:16,060 --> 01:03:20,130
(Reason for a divorce between Kim Sa Ra and Noh Yul Seong)

916
01:03:22,670 --> 01:03:24,000
Why is my name here?

917
01:03:27,540 --> 01:03:29,440
Didn't you say you had no other reason...

918
01:03:31,009 --> 01:03:32,179
coming to SOLUTION?

919
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:35,948
Well, that's...

920
01:03:35,949 --> 01:03:37,650
It wasn't someone else's meddling.

921
01:03:38,949 --> 01:03:40,380
It was your lie.

922
01:03:42,589 --> 01:03:44,989
Wait!

923
01:03:48,060 --> 01:03:49,389
Why did you come here?

924
01:03:49,589 --> 01:03:53,029
Because it'd be easier for you to be near Noh Yul Seong?

925
01:03:53,630 --> 01:03:54,698
It's not like that.

926
01:03:54,699 --> 01:03:57,129
That's why you said three months would be enough.

927
01:03:57,130 --> 01:03:58,900
That's not it, Kim Sa Ra!

928
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:02,670
Ask me. I can answer what I know.

929
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:05,540
Then, we'll be able to end it here.

930
01:04:14,319 --> 01:04:17,420
I didn't tell you because I was being careful.

931
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:19,560
Sa Ra!

932
01:04:35,770 --> 01:04:37,540
Don't you really know...

933
01:04:38,940 --> 01:04:40,040
why I joined SOLUTION?

934
01:04:48,650 --> 01:04:51,420
Don't get distracted, Sa Ra.

935
01:04:55,060 --> 01:04:56,130
Fine.

936
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:04,230
Then you shouldn't get distracted too.

937
01:05:30,029 --> 01:05:32,060
(Queen of Divorce)

938
01:06:00,460 --> 01:06:02,730
Do you also prevent a divorce?

939
01:06:02,830 --> 01:06:04,959
A divorce? Did Kim Young Hak do anything faulty?

940
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:06,129
It's from the husband's side.

941
01:06:06,130 --> 01:06:07,528
It's none other than a cult.

942
01:06:07,529 --> 01:06:10,099
CEO Yoo's divorce was done through fortune telling...

943
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:12,139
It wasn't fortune-telling. It was the energy of the universe.

944
01:06:12,339 --> 01:06:14,439
Why? What must be going on that you called me here?

945
01:06:14,440 --> 01:06:15,868
Do you believe in it?

946
01:06:15,869 --> 01:06:17,368
- I do! - I do!

947
01:06:17,369 --> 01:06:19,138
- Just like this. - My goodness! What are you doing?

948
01:06:19,139 --> 01:06:20,139
- You can see me, right? - Yes, so what?

949
01:06:20,409 --> 01:06:22,109
See what?

950
01:06:22,110 --> 01:06:24,819
Is CEO Yoo's divorce case going well?

951
01:06:24,920 --> 01:06:27,779
I'm someone who thinks in the same direction as you.

952
01:06:27,980 --> 01:06:30,318
I got it back from Chayul.

953
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:32,218
The last caller is Noh Yul Seong.

954
01:06:32,219 --> 01:06:33,889
It's a piece of evidence that proves...

955
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:35,329
Noh Yul Seong made Professor Seo commit suicide.

956
01:06:35,330 --> 01:06:36,529
I want to use Lawyer Dong.

957
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:39,429
I can finally see how...

958
01:06:40,429 --> 01:06:41,569
I can send Noh Yul Seong to prison.
