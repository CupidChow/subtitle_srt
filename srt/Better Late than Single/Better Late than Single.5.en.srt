00:00:10,635 --> 00:00:13,346
ETERNAL SINGLES' NIGHT HAS ENDED

3
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:15,473
[Seung-li sighs] This is hard.

4
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:17,809
[Sang-ho] It'd be good to pair up.

5
00:00:17,892 --> 00:00:20,103
-It's competitive, honestly.
-[Seung-li] Well…

6
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:22,814
[Jae-yun] Ji… Ji-su, right?

7
00:00:22,897 --> 00:00:24,649
-Interested?
-You're not interested?

8
00:00:24,733 --> 00:00:26,317
I am. We're rivals.

9
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:28,236
-Who is your competition?
-[Sang-ho] With who?

10
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:30,655
Well, you like her too, right?

11
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:32,866
-[Sang-ho] Oh, you like Ji-su now?
-[Seung-li] Oh…

12
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:35,410
Well, then what do you
think about the new girl?

13
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:38,538
-You tell me. How was the date?
-Honestly, I thought she was nice.

14
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:39,998
Then you should keep at it.

15
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:42,125
-[Sang-ho] Ugh…
-Why don't you go for it?

16
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:45,503
-[Sang-ho] Why did he…
-I can't believe you're into Ji-su too!

17
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:46,838
[whimsical music playing]

18
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:48,256
[Sang-ho] After our date,

19
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:52,177
I found myself really enjoying
the time I spent with Mi-ji.

20
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,511
But if I'm being honest,

21
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:55,972
Ji-su does seem to be
more on my mind right now.

22
00:00:56,055 --> 00:00:56,931
[Eun-ji] Seriously?

23
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,267
-Kim Sang-ho said he liked Mi-ji.
-[laughter]

24
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,853
-He's flip-flopping.
-He definitely said he liked Mi-ji.

25
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:04,189
I'm so curious
about what Sang-ho is thinking.

26
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:05,690
To be honest with you guys,

27
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:08,651
I was a little bit worried
they wouldn't be compatible,

28
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,945
-but I'm proud to see them get along.
-[Eun-ji] Right.

29
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:13,531
It seems like
they might have good chemistry,

30
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:15,492
but they both need to figure things out.

31
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:16,743
I'm getting a bit nervous!

32
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:19,287
-I'm a little nervous too. I do too.
-I actually feel nervous.

33
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:22,082
-Yeah, definitely.
-[Eun-ji] I feel that every day, sis!

34
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,417
Although they've all been patient
and taking things slow,

35
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:25,877
they each have their own style.

36
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,838
-You're right.
-All we can do now is hope for a couple.

37
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:29,756
-Yes.
-Please.

38
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:33,635
[Yeo-myung] Like, nothing is going my way.

39
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:36,805
I have something I'd like to say.

40
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:37,722
What is it?

41
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:38,890
[Do sighs]

42
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:43,978
I just had two spot dates

43
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:47,106
-and they were both with Jeong-mok.
-They were with Jeong-mok, right?

44
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:48,900
I asked him,

45
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:50,944
"Who was your first impression pick?"

46
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,321
-He said it was me.
-I see.

47
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,406
[melancholic music playing]

48
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,867
[Eun-ji] Oh, no.
I wish Yeo-myung didn't have to hear that.

49
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:01,121
-Yeo-myung doesn't look happy.
-Oh, but she… she looks so upset.

50
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:02,330
[Han-na] Wow…

51
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:06,084
[Do] I accidentally told her
about the spot dates.

52
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:09,337
I mean, I really thought
that everyone else knew,

53
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,505
except for me,

54
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:13,341
about the first impression picks
and what had happened.

55
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:16,344
However, based on her surprised reaction,

56
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:18,763
it seems that Jeong-mok
actually only told me.

57
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:22,767
Oh. I just feel so bad.
I really messed up here.

58
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:26,354
I need to… I really need to
find Jeong-mok and let him know.

59
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:27,480
[music fades]

60
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,315
[knocks on door]

61
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,567
[Jeong-mok] Yes?

62
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:32,318
[door lock beeps]

63
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:34,445
-Oh.
-[Do] Oh?

64
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:38,199
-[Jeong-mok] What is it?
-Oh. Jeong-mok. Do you have a minute?

65
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,201
Do you want to talk here?

66
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,162
So, actually…

67
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:45,123
I wanted to apologize.

68
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:46,124
-Apologize?
-Yes.

69
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:49,169
So, earlier, during our spot date,

70
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:53,631
well, when I asked
about your first impression pick,

71
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,967
you said it was me without any hesitation.

72
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,511
At least that's the impression
I, like, took away.

73
00:02:58,595 --> 00:02:59,637
So, I…

74
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:04,851
I thought you had already told
other people about your choice.

75
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:07,312
-Oh… you told someone?
-How you… picked me.

76
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:08,563
The other girls?

77
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:11,316
I didn't tell everyone,
but I did mention it to Yeo-myung,

78
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:13,276
and I suddenly realized,

79
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:16,821
"Oh, she didn't know,
and I just told her."

80
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,907
So… I'm sorry.

81
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:24,245
[Jeong-mok] Oh, one second. One second.

82
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:25,413
-[Han-na] What?
-What?

83
00:03:26,664 --> 00:03:29,667
-Why is he suddenly going inside?
-Where's this dude going?

84
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,753
[mellow electronic music playing]

85
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:40,178
[music fades]

86
00:03:40,261 --> 00:03:41,262
[Jeong-mok] So I…

87
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:44,474
was going to put this
in the mailbox, but here.

88
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:45,391
-For me?
-Yes.

89
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:46,309
[squeals]

90
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:47,310
-What?
-What?

91
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:50,897
He's basically saying he still likes her
even after hearing that!

92
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,774
-[Car and Han-na] Yes.
-[Eun-ji] No way.

93
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:54,525
[Do] This?

94
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,945
-Open it later, not now.
-Not right now?

95
00:03:57,028 --> 00:03:57,987
I'll open it later.

96
00:03:58,071 --> 00:03:59,322
-[Jeong-mok] Okay.
-Yeah.

97
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:02,492
[Do] Um… I appreciated it.

98
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:07,789
He expressed his feelings
back when we had the spot date together.

99
00:04:07,872 --> 00:04:09,123
But he also…

100
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,293
went ahead and gave me the postcard.

101
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:18,091
I thought, "He's continuously showing me
how he feels about me."

102
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:21,177
I'm honestly
really impressed and grateful.

103
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:23,429
[Jeong-mok] Why so dressed up?

104
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:26,057
-[Eun-ji squeals]
-[Han-na gasps] What? [chuckles]

105
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,433
[Do] Oh, I'm just…

106
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:30,895
in the same outfit I wore
for the Female Eternal Singles' Night.

107
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:33,273
[Jeong-mok] Let's go in.
Too cold to be dressed like this.

108
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:34,440
Go inside where?

109
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,109
Is he inviting her to his room?

110
00:04:36,192 --> 00:04:37,235
His actual room?

111
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:41,489
-[Jeong-mok] My room's a bit messy.
-No worries. Are you sure I can… come in?

112
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:43,825
I really only came to apologize.

113
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:46,995
-It's dark. I don't think anyone's there.
-[Do] That okay?

114
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:48,454
He's no eternal single.

115
00:04:48,538 --> 00:04:51,582
-He really isn't anymore, huh?
-He's not. He is… Wow.

116
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,543
-[Han-na] Wow.
-This is kind of exciting.

117
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,628
-What he did was so cool, man.
-Right.

118
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:58,965
She feels bad about having told
Yeo-myung about the spot dates.

119
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:01,467
-[Han-na] Yes, right.
-But it didn't faze him at all.

120
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,428
He covered it up with actions, not words.

121
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:07,015
I think now, she no longer
feels guilty about it.

122
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:09,642
-That's so true.
-[In-guk] Jeong-mok is so cool.

123
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,061
Hang on a second.

124
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,479
-[Do] But… Oh!
-[door closes]

125
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:14,981
-Let me just…
-[Do] Oh.

126
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:16,733
Thanks. How about here?

127
00:05:18,526 --> 00:05:19,569
[Do] Hmm.

128
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:25,366
Then who did you think…
or who did you suspect I liked?

129
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,618
I thought… Seung-li.

130
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:29,287
-Mm-hmm. Yes, Seung-li.
-Seriously?

131
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,663
Why is that?

132
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:33,333
I just saw it in your eyes.

133
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,043
-My eyes?
-And how you talked to him.

134
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,878
-Your eyes.
-[chuckles] My eyes?

135
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:39,255
-Yeah. I kept thinking…
-My eyes…

136
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,173
"Should I just…

137
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:42,675
go over and talk to her?

138
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:44,343
Oh, she's not looking my way."

139
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,012
Oh… I see.

140
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:47,346
You guys were talking.

141
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,016
Mmm.

142
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:52,477
I wanted to get closer to you.

143
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,936
I wrote it in the postcard.

144
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:56,522
-"I… wanna go on a date."
-Oh, I see. Oh, really?

145
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:57,940
-I'll read it.
-But… Okay.

146
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:01,527
It says I wanted a date.
I actually wrote that a while ago.

147
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,738
I'D LIKE TO GO ON A DATE
WITH YOU TOMORROW!

148
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:05,490
I HOPE WE GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER MORE

149
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:06,532
[Do chuckles]

150
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,785
-Oh, I see now.
-[enchanting music playing]

151
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:12,163
If we get the chance, I would love to.

152
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:16,459
"I should get to know him
on a more serious level."

153
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:19,879
"If we actually get the opportunity
to go on a date tomorrow,

154
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,215
I will try hard to make it work."

155
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:23,633
That's what I told myself.

156
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:24,592
I've decided.

157
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:27,595
Do you think your feelings will change?

158
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:30,139
-My feelings?
-After this is over?

159
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,933
I don't think they'll change.

160
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:32,850
Really?

161
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:33,935
-Really.
-Why?

162
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:36,479
I believe that's how attraction works.

163
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:41,859
If you feel this way from the beginning,
then it means something.

164
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,486
Ah, I see…

165
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,154
If you meet someone,

166
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,948
and you feel there's…

167
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:50,368
-no chemistry between the two of you,
-Mmm.

168
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,830
-quality time won't change that.
-Mmm.

169
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,957
That's why I think that my feelings

170
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:58,543
towards you won't change at all.

171
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:04,549
-It's getting late. You tired?
-[Do] Yeah. I'll go.

172
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:06,926
Bye. Good night.

173
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,138
[music fades]

174
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:12,974
-Wow. Why is he so cool? He's so…
-Seriously.

175
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:15,393
-He's not being too much either.
-[Eun-ji] Yes.

176
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:17,812
That was a nice ending
to his spicy confession.

177
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:19,981
-[Han-na] Exactly.
-The perfect way to end the day.

178
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:23,067
I don't know how things will turn out,
but Jeong-mok did a great job.

179
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,861
-[In-guk] It was pretty cool.
-He did.

180
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,321
Yes. This could help him
win her over from Seung-li.

181
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:28,239
[Eun-ji] Yes!

182
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:30,241
[pleasant music playing]

183
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:33,411
[Eun-ji] It's already the fourth day.
Time goes by fast.

184
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:35,997
[birds chirping]

185
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:40,293
KIM SANG-HO
KIM SEUNG-LI

186
00:07:41,085 --> 00:07:43,129
-[Hyun-kyu] Morning.
-[Seung-li] Huh? What? Morning.

187
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:44,422
-Hello.
-[Sang-ho] Who is it?

188
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:46,299
-[Seung-li] Drunk?
-[Hyun-kyu] This early?

189
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:49,427
I did a couple sets
of bench presses outside, and got hot.

190
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,845
[Seung-li] You worked out?

191
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:52,930
-When did you wake up?
-My mental health needed it!

192
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:55,141
-[both] Why?
-It's too much. I'm brain-dead.

193
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:57,226
-[Seung-li] Why?
-I feel like my head's gonna blow!

194
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,480
This group is so funny.
It's the room with Ji-su's three guys.

195
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,106
-[Han-na] You're right.
-That's true!

196
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,358
-It's the Ji-su fan club. Yeah.
-[Han-na] Yes.

197
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:05,568
Why? What happened?

198
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:08,362
I'm curious about something.

199
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,449
-We're gonna pick today, right?
-Most likely, yeah.

200
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:13,784
Is there someone
you've thought of picking?

201
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:15,495
[all chuckling]

202
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,413
[Hyun-kyu] I'm curious
who others will choose.

203
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,081
[Sang-ho] Yeah, oh, hang on.

204
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,292
[Seung-li] Then you must be
really worried.

205
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:22,919
[Hyun-kyu] Right.

206
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,171
-But you're killing it.
-You think so?

207
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:27,298
-You're obviously doing the best here.
-Really?

208
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:28,591
-Really.
-[Sang-ho] True.

209
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:30,301
But you're only interested…

210
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:32,929
in one person, right?

211
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,347
-Hyun-kyu?
-Right.

212
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,765
Yesterday, I was really…

213
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,392
stuck between two options.

214
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,269
-Two?
-But now it's down to one.

215
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,188
-Oh, really? It's definitely her, huh?
-Yes.

216
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:43,773
[both chuckle]

217
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,525
[pensive music playing]

218
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,443
In your opinion, do you think

219
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:51,364
-there's… other contestants who…
-Hmm.

220
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:53,407
…like the same person you do?

221
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:58,871
-I definitely think so.
-Really?

222
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:04,460
Oh, this is… a very risky conversation.

223
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,171
[Hyun-kyu] From what I gathered
the day before,

224
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:10,841
it seemed like Ji-su
was trying to choose between three people.

225
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:15,388
I overheard her say that
it was me, Sang-ho, and Seung-li.

226
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:17,223
Obviously, I wasn't sure,

227
00:09:17,306 --> 00:09:20,309
so I wanted to check in
with Seung-li and see how he felt.

228
00:09:20,393 --> 00:09:22,436
I really can't tell who you like.

229
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:25,273
You'll find out soon, right?

230
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:26,774
During a game.

231
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:29,402
-Right.
-A game or, like, when we pick?

232
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:30,695
-A vote?
-When we pick?

233
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:31,696
Right. Right.

234
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:33,573
Go ahead.

235
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,992
-[Hyun-kyu] Okay. See you later.
-Take it easy.

236
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:38,411
[door beeps, opens]

237
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,497
-[Sang-ho] Where's Hyun-kyu?
-You mean my competition?

238
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,959
He got a slight head start.
He's already going after her.

239
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:47,295
-Right.
-But now he's getting nervous.

240
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:51,007
-Oh, he took the wrong path.
-Because he knows that he has competitors.

241
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,302
-Right. Yeah, yeah.
-Yep, he's figured it out.

242
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:55,595
So that's why…

243
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:58,848
he's so nervous.

244
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,310
It's officially a war, damn it!

245
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:05,062
[groans loudly]

246
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:09,609
Oh, I'm curious about how Ji-su feels.

247
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:12,194
Exactly! Who's her top choice
out of those three?

248
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:15,031
-[cell phone chimes]
-[Yeo-myung] What is it?

249
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:18,367
-Oh! The Dating Newsletter is here.
-[Mi-ji] The newsletter?

250
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,036
-[exciting music playing]
-What?

251
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:21,662
"5 Minute Library."

252
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:23,664
It'll be open for one hour.

253
00:10:23,748 --> 00:10:25,499
"Only one person enters at a time."

254
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,501
"You can use it multiple times
while it's open,

255
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,670
but you only get five minutes."

256
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,547
Each person can only use it once?

257
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,549
-We'd better get over there quick.
-To be first.

258
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:35,843
[Eun-ji] Oh, whoa, whoa!

259
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:37,303
Oh, is that Min-hong?

260
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:39,472
I didn't think Min-hong
would run like that.

261
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,600
Oh, you're all so fast.

262
00:10:42,683 --> 00:10:44,685
-[Car laughs]
-We get five minutes each.

263
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:48,230
If we get five minutes,
I think we can each use it only once.

264
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:49,607
Hence there's 12 of us.

265

266
00:10:51,359 --> 00:10:52,526
-It's hot.
-Never mind.

267
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,236
It depends on how many diaries you read?

[amusing music playing]

269
00:10:58,157 --> 00:10:59,909

-Oh, he's adorable

272
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:07,667
[Jae-yun] Today, I went to the library
and I got to look at Yeo-myung's diary.

273
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,377
-He's in a hurry.
-[Han-na] Taking notes?

274
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,212
Look at him study
like he's taking the MCAT.

275
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:13,839
[Jae-yun] What does she like?

276
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,218
Okay…

277
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:18,928
Look at this little scholar go.

278
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:20,971
He looks like he's studying for a test.

Oh, that was insane.

285
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:39,990
I couldn't believe
how quickly Jae-yun was moving.

286
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,200

-Is he practicing?
-[Han-na] I'm confused.

-[Han-na] Aww!
-[Eun-ji] Really?

From who?

I WISH WE COULD'VE TALKED ABOUT YOUR TYPE
LET'S HANG OUT

309
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:28,706
It must be Jae-yun.

-Exactly.

315
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,092
-I think it was time.
-Yes.

Do you have an ideal type?

319
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,350
My ideal type…

320
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:53,147
I would say people… with soft features.

321
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:57,860
I usually prefer rounded… faces.

322
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:01,113
-Nice.
-What's yours?

323
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,407
-Like, what kind of person…
-Ideal type?

324
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:06,494
In terms of personality,
they gotta be sweet.

-Oh.

I was about to tell you.

[Han-na] They got cut off here.

valuable information.

00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:31,519
"Sweet." Okay.

339
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:33,020
Has it not been an hour yet?

341
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:38,734
[Hyun-kyu] Since I'm only interested
in one person, I only read Ji-su's diary.

342
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:40,528
[Sang-ho] I read Ji-su's diary.

343
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:42,988
[Seung-li] I decided to read
Kang Ji-su's diary.

344
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:46,534
-[In-guk] They'll wear it out.
-[Eun-ji] It's turning into a used book.

345
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:47,493
[Han-na chuckles]

346
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50,120

347
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,586

what will happen with them.

00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,717
-[Seung-chan] It's closed.
-[Sang-ho] Let's head back.

352
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:06,762
I think things will change
now that everyone's read a diary.

353
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,473
What is this? Oh, it's mine.

354
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:11,767
Wait. What is this?

355
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,353
[intriguing music playing]

356
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:18,315
LAST NIGHT

357
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,989
[Yeo-myung] Today,
I decided to write a letter

358
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:27,700
and carry it around with me
for safekeeping.

359
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:30,119
It was a letter for Jeong-mok.

360
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:33,372
-[intriguing music continues]
-[insects trilling]

361
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:47,928
Ooh, Jae-yun and Jeong-mok
are in the same room.

362
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:54,393
[Jeong-mok] My heart felt
a little heavy. I just…

363
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,688
I had a feeling that Jae-yun, my roommate,

364
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:00,733
was also very interested in Yeo-myung.

365
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:05,362
I felt uneasy, wondering,
"Oh, should I tell Jae-yun about this?"

366
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:08,699
"And, like, how do I even start
that conversation with him?"

367
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:14,705
[Car and Han-na groan]

368
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:15,789
-Oh, no.
-[Car] Jeez.

369
00:15:15,873 --> 00:15:19,168
-Man, this is very confusing.
-He can't say anything.

370
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,878
-[In-guk] This is hard.
-Yeah.

371
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:22,546
-[Eun-ji] Exactly.
-This is really hard.

372
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:24,423
[music fades]

373
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:26,091
You managed to read them all?

374
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:28,510
[Ji-yeon] I had some time to kill.

375
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:32,640
-Oh… I see.
-I'm not really set on anyone yet.

376
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:38,687
-I might be into Jeong-mok.
-Really?

377
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:42,608
When I was waiting for my turn
at the 5 Minute Library,

378
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:45,527
the other guys were saying,
"Oh, it's hot."

379
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:47,237
"Well, let's go inside."

380
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:49,239
But Jeong-mok said he'd wait with me.

381
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,824
He stayed outside.

382
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,618
20 MINUTES EARLIER

383
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:55,120
-[Seung-li] It's so damn hot today.
-I know, huh?

384
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:58,123
-How long will this take?
-[Seung-li] I'm gonna wait in my room.

385
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,000
-You wanna come with us?
-Good idea.

386
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:01,377
Come to our room.

387
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,836
Bye.

388
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,213
[Jeong-mok] I'll wait for you.

389
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,715
[gasps] Wait, is it only Jeong-mok
that's waiting for her?

390
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,884
Right. They're kinda slow.

391
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,344
How'd you sleep?

392
00:16:10,427 --> 00:16:11,762
-Like a baby.
-Like a baby?

393
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:13,013
-Yes.
-Really?

394
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:14,056
Oh, yeah.

395
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,641
I passed out immediately.

396
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:17,476
Oh. My turn.

397
00:16:18,602 --> 00:16:19,770
I'll get going.

00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:33,158
The guys are picking today.

403
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:35,244
[Han-na] Oh, it's the guys' turn to pick.

405
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,539

407
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,458
[Ji-yeon] A punch machine.

[Seung-chan] "Male eternal singles

00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:51,552
[Jae-yun] Any strategy?

413
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:53,220
-Or--
-Nope. Never played before.

414
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:55,222
Oh, this is a game for Seung-li.

415
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:57,182
[Ji-yeon laughs] "A game for Seung-li."

416
00:16:58,058 --> 00:16:59,268
Oh, ho!

417
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:04,189
As soon as I saw the punch machine,
I thought, "I got this."

418
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,733
Nobody could beat me.

419
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:07,818
[Sang-ho] Big arms. [gasps]

00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:09,945
-Wow. Confidence.
-[Eun-ji] Seung-li works out.

-He looks pretty strong.
-[Han-na] Oh… [laughs]

422

Like this?

423
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,700
-You're practicing?
-[Jeong-mok] Hey.

424
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:15,701
Is that necessary?

425
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:16,994
It is if you're not big.

426
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:19,913
-Let's… leave them out.
-[Sang-ho] Yeah.

[Seung-li] I think we're ready.

on a proper date with Ji-su

-[Sang-ho] All right.

So I did my best.

463
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:41,495

00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:08,707
[Min-hong] You got this!

504
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:12,753
[Jeong-mok] I'm really excited

505
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:15,172
at the thought
of maybe going on a date with Do.

506
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,343
-[Cupids exclaim]
-[In-guk] What a hit.

507
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:21,261
-[Han-na] He did great.
-[Eun-ji] Strong hit!

508
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:23,305
-[Jae-yun] High points.
-So that's how it's done.

509
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,557
-What's your score?
-[Seung-chan] Great use of space.

510
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:26,767
"Use of space."

511
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:31,146
[Yeo-myung] Your points?

[Eun-ji and Car exclaim]

515
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,319
-You're tied.
-[Yeo-myung] Same score.

516
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:39,071
Then Hyun-kyu gets to go first.

517
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:40,864
-How did that happen?
-[Ji-yeon] I know.

518
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:42,491
Seung-li is in first place.

[upbeat music playing]

526
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:53,919
Ji-su.

527
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:55,712
-Here you go.
-[Eun-ji] Seung-li and Ji-su?

528
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:58,006
-[Car] Bound to happen.
-[Han-na] Of course, it's Ji-su.

529
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:00,050
-[In-guk] He didn't hesitate at all.
-[Car] Nope.

530
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,095
WHO DO YOU WANT A ONE-ON-ONE DATE WITH?

531
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:04,346

532
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,348

Mmm…

535
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:12,896
-[Eun-ji] Seung-li, right? Hyun-kyu?
-[Han-na] What if it's Sang-ho? Hyun-kyu?

536
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:17,109
I think it's Seung-li.

537
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:18,402
[Eun-ji and Han-na gasp]

538
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:21,280
She is totally Camp Seung-li now.

539
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:23,448
-He made an impression in the Caravan.
-Right.

540
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,367
-[Han-na] Strong impression.
-Really intense.

541
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,285
So true.

542
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:28,745
[enchanting music playing]

543
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:36,461
[Hyun-kyu] As I predicted,
Seung-li chose Ji-su.

544
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:39,047
I was a little shocked, to be honest.

545
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:42,342
But I had come up with a plan,
so I went ahead with it.

546
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:43,385
My turn? My turn?

547
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:45,262
[Jeong-mok and Yeo-myung] Hyun-kyu.

548
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:47,180
[curious music playing]

549
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,391
-[In-guk] What?
-[Eun-ji] Yeo-myung?

550
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:51,852
[Hyun-kyu] I'm choosing
to give mine to Yeo-myung.

551
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,397
Oh? Why did he choose me?

552
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:59,818
Oh, he must've chosen me
as a backup option.

553
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:04,072
I think he probably wants to use me
to get intel on Ji-su.

554
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:06,575
-Oh, roommates? I see.
-[In-guk] Oh, roommates.

555
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:11,079
[Jae-yun] At that point,
my mind just went blank.

556
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,707
I was in this… kind of daze.

559
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:21,840
[Min-hong] It's obviously Jeong-mok.

560
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:25,927
But for a second,
I thought he might go with someone else.

561
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,512
"I shouldn't feel so sad."

562
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:30,140
That's what I kept saying to myself
while watching.

563
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,562
-[Do] Thank you.
-Here you go.

564
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,191
[Min-hong] Seeing this happen
in front of me,

565
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:41,651
it made me think,
"Oh, I'm not cool enough for this."

566
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,820
"I'm really just a total loser."

567
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:48,116
From Jeong-mok.

568
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,869
I've been wanting to go
on a one-on-one date with him,

569
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:53,080
but I haven't gotten a chance yet.

570
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,372

577
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:07,969
[Jeong-mok] Jae-yun.

578
00:23:08,053 --> 00:23:09,596

-[Do] Jae-yun.

-[Hyun-kyu] Wait.

00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:18,063
-What the…
-[Ji-su] What?

583
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:20,023
-[Hyun-kyu] No overlaps allowed.
-[Sang-ho] No.

584
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:22,984
-[Seung-chan] What? What is he…
-Who… needs one?

585
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,528
-Who needs one?
-[Sang-ho] Seriously?

586
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:26,404
-Who hasn't got one?
-Who's his pick?

587
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:30,325
Hey, come on. Then it feels like
you're giving it to whoever's left.

[Sang-ho] The last one has no choice.

592
00:23:48,844 --> 00:23:49,845
Thank you.

593
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:58,728
Jae-yun must've stopped watching
who gave their card to whom,

594
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:02,065
-the moment Yeo-myung got Hyun-kyu's card.
-Right. He lost interest.

595
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:02,983
[Eun-ji] He did.

596
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:05,360
Actually, earlier,
in the 5 Minute Library,

597
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:07,946
he read how she likes
a well-put-together guy.

598
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:10,699
Now that you mention it,
he does look put together.

599
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:13,243
-Jae-yun tends to glitch out a lot.
-[Car] Right.

600
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:14,578
He's still a little awkward

601
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:16,621
-when it comes to dealing with emotions.
-Yeah.

602
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:19,082
He could've unintentionally
hurt Ji-yeon's feelings.

603
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:21,376
-Yeah, he might have.
-[Car] My God.

00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:25,046

IN THEIR DESIRED DATE LOCATION

-[Jeong-mok] Oh, it's double dates.

609
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:34,181
[Do] They have ATVs too!

610

No, not the ATVs.

Makgeolli's cool.
I don't know about bowling.

Makgeolli doesn't sound bad, though.

00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,274
I don't know.

-[Car] Makgeolli.

622
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,371
[Eun-ji] Ji-su has chosen makgeolli.

623
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,042
[Hyun-kyu] Since Ji-su went first,

624
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:05,670
I thought it would be a good idea
to take the spot right next to hers.

625
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,464
I'm okay with anything.

626

-Rack, paper, scissors.
-You don't have to go.

-What? Really?
-Then I'll do this.

635
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:25,023
I really want to go bowling.

636
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:26,650
-Really?
-Yeah.

637
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:29,778
If it were up to me,
I would've picked ATVs

638
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:32,697
or another activity
like makgeolli or something.

639
00:25:32,781 --> 00:25:33,698
Do wanted bowling.

640
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,200
So I went along with it

641
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:38,787
to make sure that we both went
on a double date with Jeong-mok.

642
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:39,829
Bowling it is.

[cheerful music playing]

644
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:42,666

Do whatever you want, but just pick.

651

[Ji-su] ATVs do sound kind of fun.

00:25:55,762 --> 00:25:56,721
[Do] Oh!

653
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:00,934
No.

-I'll go bowling.
-[Yeo-myung] Oh.

655
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:04,312
Oh.

I got my date.

661
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:18,743
I feel like this activity
will let me get to know him better.

662
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:19,869
I feel giddy.

663
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:22,497
So she wants to spend
as much time with him.

664
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,833
Especially since
she never had the chance to.

665

Since it's too hot today,
shall we have makgeolli?

00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:39,264
[Seung-chan] I think it'll be fun.

671
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:41,975
[Yeo-myung] Okay,
so I'll see you in a bit, Hyun-kyu.

672
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:43,310
[Hyun-kyu] See you later.

673
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,562
It looks like this'll be the first date

674
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:48,481
that Jeong-mok and Do
express their feelings more.

675
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:51,109
-Mmm.
-But Yeo-myung chose to go bowling

676
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:53,236
-only because of Jeong-mok.
-[Car] Oh…

677
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:55,447
-It's looking like a love triangle.
-[Han-na] Right.

678
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:56,823
Between the both of them,

679
00:26:56,906 --> 00:27:00,952
Seung-li will probably
be the one who tries the hardest.

680
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:01,870
-Right.
-Yes.

681
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:03,455
Since he got another chance.

682
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:04,998
But Sang-ho also likes Ji-su.

683
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:07,459
-[Eun-ji] Right.
-So this might get awkward.

684
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:09,461
Yikes, these double dates make me anxious.

685
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:11,629
-[Han-na] I know, right?
-Double dates are awful.

686
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:14,174
I always had bad experiences,
back in the day.

687
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:16,343
-[Han-na] Were they bad?
-I always got into trouble.

688
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:19,179
-[Eun-ji] Don't I know it.
-I always got into trouble with my date.

689
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:21,848
-"Why are you using the wrong fork?"
-Jeez. Stop it.

690
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:24,267
-"Embarrassing me in front of everyone!"
-What?

691
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:27,020
"And why do you keep serving wine
to the other woman?"

692
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:28,980
-She asked for a refill!
-[laughing]

693
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:30,273

PARK JI-YEON
Yi DO

695
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:35,362
[Ji-yeon] I feel…
like I'm gonna look pissed off today.

696
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:40,241
I've felt like crap
since the event from earlier today,

697
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:43,411
I couldn't control my facial expression.

698
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,080
But it was kind of…

699
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:46,873
-It was kind of mean.
-Right?

700
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:48,500
-Why did he do that in front…
-I know!

701
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:51,252
If he hadn't stood there awkwardly
and just given me the card,

702
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,712
I wouldn't be this upset.

703
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:54,881
He was all like, "Who's left? Who?"

704
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:57,258
His energy made it seem like
he had no choice.

705
00:27:57,342 --> 00:28:00,053
-Yeah, kind of like, really negative, huh?
-I think so.

706
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:01,679
He was so unsure about it.

707
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:05,141
-That was so annoying.
-Agreed, totally. I mean, if it were me,

708
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:07,435
-I would've lost my cool immediately.
-Right?

709
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:10,897
I just don't understand why he
had to do that whole act in front of me.

710
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:11,898
[Do] Mmm.

711
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:14,901
[Ji-yeon sighs in exasperation]
I'm over this. So annoying.

712
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:17,779
I really need to gather myself right now.

713
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:20,156
[sighs] I feel so down today.

714
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,075
It's been really hard.

715
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,661
I didn't know I'd be like this.

716
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:26,538
[gasps]

717
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:28,456
-Right, her feelings are hurt.
-[Han-na] Yeah.

718
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,251
I think this is the first time
Ji-yeon expresses these emotions.

719
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:33,753
If she goes on a date
feeling like this, then,

720
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:36,297
it might be really uncomfortable for them.

721

MAKGEOLLI DATE

722
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:40,593
[Han-na] Ji-su, Seung-li, Mi-ji,
and Sang-ho are on a double date.

723
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:42,762
Do you want to drive, or should I?

724
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:45,598
-I can drive there.
-Sure. We'll switch on the way back.

725
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:46,516
Okay.

726
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:48,143
[breezy music playing]

727
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:51,312
-I'm a way better driver than Sang-ho.
-[chuckles] Oh, man…

728
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:52,230
Really?

729
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:54,524
You'll have a smoother ride
than yesterday.

730
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:55,859
I tried my best.

731
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:58,737
-[Han-na] What?
-Oh, what is this? Are they roasting him?

732
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,904
[both laugh]

733
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:01,364
They're rivals after all.

734
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:07,328
-It's really hot. Right? Isn't it hot?
-Yeah.

735
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:09,831
-[Ji-su] Yeah. It's hot.
-If it's too hot, turn on the AC.

736
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:10,790
Raise it a bit.

737
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:12,208
-A little. Yeah.
-A bit, a bit.

738
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:14,627
[mellow midtempo music playing]

739
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:18,923
Seeing Sang-ho made me realize,
"Oh, wait. This might get awkward."

740
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:22,469
I wanted to talk to Seung-li,
but if Sang-ho was there too,

741
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:25,597
I was worried
it would be a little too much.

742
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,766
Would you get distracted if we talked?

743
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:29,350
-Not at all.
-Oh, yeah? Great.

744
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:32,228
-You sure?
-I'm a more… relaxed driver than Sang-ho.

745
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:33,646
[Ji-su chuckles] What?

746
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,690
-[Seung-li] Oh.
-Guess I'm a bad driver.

747
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,859
He keeps provoking Sang-ho.

748
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:41,780
Um… so, that game…
That was your first game, right?

749
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:43,615
-Mm-hmm. Right.
-First, it's games,

750
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:45,450
then you're throwing punches on a machine.

751
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:47,744
Man, that game was way too easy.

752
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:49,204
-[chuckles]
-For me, anyway.

753
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:50,872
-Ohhh!
-[Ji-su] But…

754
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:52,832
-Dude, you're relentless.
-I just…

755
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:56,169
I lightly knocked on it
and I got first place.

756
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:58,296
I just didn't have
my wrist lined up right.

757
00:29:58,379 --> 00:29:59,672
You angled your wrist wrong?

758
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:01,132
[amusing music playing]

759
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,176
-Well, it was actually my stance.
-[chuckles]

760
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:04,719
Excuses, excuses.

761
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:07,722
-I thought I'd get second or third.
-[Seung-li] Those sound like excuses.

762
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,308
[laughs]

763
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:12,727
Honestly, I'm just glad I wasn't last.

764
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:17,440
-[Mi-ji] We're here! Thanks for driving.
-[Seung-li] Is this it? No problem.

765
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:19,359
-[staff] Hello.
-[Sang-ho and Seung-li] Hi.

766
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:21,319
-[staff] Welcome. Come in.
-[Ji-su] Thank you.

767
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:22,862
-[Ji-su] Hello.
-How you doin'?

768
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:24,864
-A makgeolli brewery?
-[Eun-ji] Brewery?

769
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:26,825
-They're gonna make some.
-[Car] I guess so.

770
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:29,619
[staff] You will be making makgeolli
with glutinous rice.

771
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:30,954
Put your head through,

772
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:32,997
and both arms in.

773
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:34,707
-Turn it around.
-Which way?

774
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:37,210
-[staff] Put it in.
-What's happening?

775
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:39,838
From there,
you pull on these strings here.

776
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:41,297
-[Ji-su] Like that.
-Complicated.

777
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:42,674
[staff] Just like that. Great.

778
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:43,758
[Ji-su] Need help?

779
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:44,759
Need help?

780
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,594
-[Sang-ho] Mmm…
-One second.

781
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:48,888
-[Ji-su] Mmm.
-[staff] The other side.

782
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:51,266
-[Mi-ji] Turn it.
-Oh, this is hard.

783
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:53,726
-[Mi-ji] Turn it over.
-[staff] You have it inside out, sir.

I'm so out of it.

786

[Eun-ji] Oh, Sang-ho
must have a lot on his mind.

787
00:30:58,314 --> 00:31:00,692
-[In-guk] He looks really out of it.
-[Eun-ji] Ah…

788
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:02,527
-Just flip it over.
-Oh, yeah.

789
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:04,779
-Put your head through there.
-[Mi-ji] Put it in.

790
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:05,989
I… I'll help you.

791
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:08,867
-Like this?
-[Seung-li] Wait. It's…

792
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,077
-No, hold this.
-Tangled. Okay.

793
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,829
[Seung-li] No, just leave it there. Here.

794
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:14,956
Oh. He didn't let Ji-su do it.

795
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:18,543
-Like this.
-You're tying it too tight. Okay.

796
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:20,628
He doesn't want her
to touch Sang-ho at all.

797
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,464
-I really like Seung-li.
-[In-guk] Damn, he's so smooth.

798
00:31:24,757 --> 00:31:28,052
[staff] First up is a tasting,
then we'll get to the workshop.

799
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,137
We'll get to drink?

800
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:32,098
[chuckles] If we try them all,
we'll get faded!

801
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:34,642
First, we'll taste the alcohol

802
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,811
-made with buckwheat.
-[Seung-li] How strong?

803
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:37,812
-40%.
-That's strong.

804
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,355
-40%?
-[staff] If you will,

805
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:42,066
please pour however much
you'd like and have a taste.

806
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:44,861
Oh, let me…

807
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:46,279
-Here.
-[Mi-ji] Be careful.

808
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:47,906
This wasn't strong enough.

809
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:49,657
-Too light.
-[Car] Hmm.

810
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:52,035
-He keeps provoking him.
-[Han-na] He is.

811
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:53,077
He is.

812
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:55,663
Another shot, then.

Another one?

816
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:01,127
Then… pour me one.

817
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:03,379
-I ain't losing.
-[chuckles] You're so done.

818

-Whoa. What're you guys doing?
-You guys are gonna end up wasted.

-Yeah.
-This is the start of a war.

-Like this. Cheers.
-Cheers.

00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:13,014
-Cheers. You're too far.
-Cheers.

823
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:13,932
Yeah.

00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:23,066

00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,500
[Mi-ji chuckles]

834
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,299
Ah, fuck it.

835
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:50,551
-Whoa, whoa. Wait. Wait.
-[chuckles] Oh…

836
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,261
["Way Beyond" continues]

837
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:54,722
We should… keep up with you guys.

838
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,891
[Seung-li] Come on, let's do one more.

839
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,395
Whoa, that's strong.

840
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:02,397
[Eun-ji] This was
supposed to be a tasting…

841
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,108
-[Han-na] Wow!
-…but it's turned into a battle.

842
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:07,443
-You can pour it out as you go. Okay.
-I'm okay.

843
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,821
-No. It's not cool. Please.
-[Car] Come on.

844
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:13,324
[staff] This one is also 40%,
so please be mindful.

845
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:14,701
-Yes.
-Yeah.

846
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:16,494
[Car] Why is Seung-li doing that?

847
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:18,913
-He was doing so well.
-A little more…

848
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:26,212
You're making him pour more and more too.

849
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:27,255
[laughs]

850
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:30,717
-[Seung-li] I'm getting competitive.
-[In-guk] I don't think it's a good idea

851
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,344
-to start this kind of battle.
-[Car] This is really bad.

852
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:35,054
[Eun-ji] This is so unnecessary.

853
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:35,972
[Sang-ho] Well?

854
00:33:36,055 --> 00:33:37,473
-That's strong.
-I know.

855
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:39,892
[Seung-li] We were very competitive.

856
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:41,436
It got intense.

857
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,938
The girls didn't really drink
as much as we did,

858
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:47,316
but were going toe-to-toe
trying to outdrink each other.

859
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:56,784
I'm really competitive.

860
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:59,746
WHAT WOULD YOU DO
IF THERE'S A COMPETITOR?

861
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:02,999
Honestly, I think I'd… take her from him.

862
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:04,333
[man] You ever done that?

863
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:05,960
-No.
-[staff laughs]

864
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:08,546
-[staff 1] Then how do you know?
-[staff 2] You're such a liar.

865
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:11,466
I'm just using my imagination.
It's a kind of daydream.

866
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:14,469
If it wasn't Sang-ho,
I wouldn't have gone this far.

867
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:16,345
I'm doing this because it's Sang-ho.

868
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:17,972
My rival.

869
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:23,102
He got really competitive
and it bothered me a bit.

870
00:34:24,312 --> 00:34:25,772
Let's say, you go in

871
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:28,149
and you meet a girl
and you really like her,

872
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,443
but another guy also happens to like her.

873
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:31,611
What are you going to do?

874
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:32,779
I'll give it my all.

875
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:34,947
This could…

876
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:37,033
be my one and only chance with a girl.

877
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:39,327
-[Ji-su] You know how to do it?
-[staff] Just in case…

878
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:42,080
[Seung-li] I'm very competitive.

879
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:44,207
I have this drive… to always win.

880
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:47,627
It's a lot. Even just this much
is about five soju shots.

881
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,420
-Can I say something?
-Maybe three.

882
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,925
You both have rice
stuck in your hair. [chuckles]

883
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:55,968
[Han-na] That means "get it together."

884
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:57,845
[quirky music playing]

885
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:01,599
Oh, man, this alcohol is actually
pretty strong. I'm getting tipsy.

886
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:03,559
We basically drank a bottle of soju.

887
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:06,229
-Why are you drinking this much again?
-[Sang-ho] I don't know.

888
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:08,356
-[Mi-ji] Good point.
-[Sang-ho] Why did we drink?

889
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,398
[Mi-ji chuckles]

890
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:11,776
[Ji-su] I wasn't happy at all.

891
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:14,195
They started having a drinking battle.

892
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:16,489
Why would they do that?

893
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:19,283
Was I the only one
who wanted to talk to Seung-li?

894
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:22,453
I don't understand
why they'd compete with alcohol.

895
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:25,581
Shouldn't he try and talk more,
show more interest in me…

896
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:27,250
you know, things like that?

897
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:29,502
I get that he's competitive or whatever,

898
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:31,879
but there's a time
and place for everything.

899
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,840
That really damaged our relationship.

900
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:35,174
[Han-na] Oh, no.

901
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:38,469
It was definitely not the place
to get drunk, but they did it anyway.

902
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,680
-The date hasn't really started yet.
-[Eun-ji] Mm-hmm.

903
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:42,849
These guys are really messing up. [sighs]

904
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:46,352
The more you knead it,
the quicker it will dry up on you.

905
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:47,562
Exactly. Exactly.

906
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:49,313
-He's good at this. Yes.
-Oh.

907
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:51,524
-It's the alcohol from earlier.
-We're falling behind.

908
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:54,068
-Okay. Hurry. It's a race.
-We can't lose.

909
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,279
-They don't stand a chance.
-[chuckles]

910
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:59,657
-[Seung-li] It's not even a competition.
-Can you stop competing?

911
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,450
-What? We can catch up.
-Stop for a second.

912
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:02,660
We need to compete.

913
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:04,537
-[thrilling music playing]
-[staff] Perfect.

914
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:06,289
Will you be sore?

915
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:08,541
Dude, she literally asked you to stop!

916
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:10,960
They're going twice as fast.

917
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:12,086
We gotta hurry up.

918
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,337
-I got this.
-Together.

919
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:15,631
I think theirs might be too dry.

920
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:16,799
-This is fun.
-Right?

921
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:18,426
-Yeah.
-[Ji-su] You're still competing?

922
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,428
-What?
-I think we should call a truce.

923
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:22,638
-What truce? This is war.
-[Sang-ho] Come on, really?

924
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:24,557
-[Han-na] Please.
-[Car] She's uncomfortable.

925
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,017
Are you tired?

926
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,268
I'm not tired.

927
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:29,103
-Wow there.
-Don't make this tiring.

928
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:30,354
[Seung-li] Sorry.

929
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:32,773
This isn't something
to get so heated over.

930
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:34,025
[Seung-li] It's a race.

931
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:37,278
-Are you red 'cause you're drunk or tired?
-Both. [chuckles]

932
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:38,571
[Ji-su] Is he drunk too?

933
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:41,407
-[Seung-li] You're turning red, dude!
-I can't tell. I'm sure I am.

934
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:44,619
-Seung-li's face is more red.
-I get red so easily.

935
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,621
-It only takes one drink. It sucks.
-[both] Oh.

936
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:48,414
I have a bad liver.

937
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:50,583
If that's the case, don't drink! [laughs]

938
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:52,710
[cheerful music playing]

939
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:55,588
[Sang-ho] I'm kinda sweaty now.

940
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:58,382
[Mi-ji] Why… are you sweating?
You worked too hard.

941
00:36:58,466 --> 00:36:59,550
[Sang-ho] I know.

942
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:01,719
[Seung-li] I loved that.

943
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:02,762
Was it fun for you?

944
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:04,639
-How was today?
-[Han-na] That wasn't fun.

945
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:07,350
-She didn't get to do anything! Seriously.
-How is that fun?

946
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:09,727
-[Han-na] Seung-li had fun.
-[Car] What was fun about it?

947
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:12,772
She just sat there while you drank.
How is that fun for her?

948
00:37:12,855 --> 00:37:13,981
Oh, I'm so annoyed.

949
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,775
Seriously. I mean, Ji-su…

950
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:17,693
-[laughing]
-Who would… who would…

951
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:20,696
-She's… She's so upset.
-[Eun-ji] It's sad.

952
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,657
How could you be so composed, Han-na?

953
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,283
You're really quite impressive.

954
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:27,119
[Han-na laughing] Why is this so funny?

955
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,621
[all laughing]

956
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:30,748
-Oh, it's so infuriating.
-[In-guk] So crazy.

957
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:33,876
I'm still shocked
that he asked her, "Wasn't it fun?"

958
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:37,046
Can you two understand those boys?
Why are they battling like that?

959
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:38,381
I can't understand them at all.

960
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:41,342
-Such a foolish thing to do. Yes.
-[In-guk] It's extremely foolish.

961
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:43,552
Is it to show off their manliness or what?

962
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:45,471
-I really don't know.
-[Car] My God…

963
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:48,599
So both Seung-li and Sang-ho
have feelings for Ji-su.

964
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:49,934
-Correct?
-Yeah.

965
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:52,311
-That fire… was actually lit a while ago.
-Right.

966
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:56,065
Seung-li is now hyper-focused
on beating Sang-ho.

967
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:57,108
That's so true.

968
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:59,902
And from Ji-su's perspective,
he made things worse

969
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:02,363
because she asked him
to stop being so competitive.

970
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:05,032
-[Eun-ji] Good point.
-She asked him to stop several times.

971
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:08,202
She did, and she kept giving him hints,
but he kept on going.

972
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:10,621
[pleasant music playing]

973
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:13,749
-Do we have to do anything?
-[chuckles]

974
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:14,750
I think so.

975
00:38:15,334 --> 00:38:17,837
"Eat a delicious meal."
We'll be eating separately.

976
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,338
-[Seung-li] Cool.
-[Sang-ho] Oh.

977
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:23,342
For the double date,
I wasn't trying too hard to break the ice.

978
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:27,346
But I think the individual date
is where I shined.

979
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:30,725
-What did you think?
-[Ji-su] About the date?

980
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:32,810
-[Seung-li] It sucks it was a double date.
-Yeah.

981
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:34,103
[Seung-li] But I had fun.

982
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:38,441
[clicks tongue] I know I look
kind of tired because I drank,

983
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:40,818
but I actually ended up
having a lot of fun.

984
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:42,611
Yeah, that pissed me off.

985
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:43,612
-You're mad?
-Yeah.

986
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:45,906
I mean, yesterday, when I got your letter,

987
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,366
I was… [chuckles] like…

988
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:49,327
really happy

989
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:51,704
and looking forward
to hanging out together.

990
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:56,083
But then, you suddenly started
this stupid drinking battle.

991
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,294
Oh, man, I took it too far.

992
00:38:58,377 --> 00:39:00,880
-Did you come here to drink with Sang-ho?
-Oh, boy.

993
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:02,673
[pensive music playing]

994
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:08,679
-It's a total day fade.
-[Ji-su] Yeah.

995
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:10,931
I'm feeling a little tipsy.

996
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:16,312
-[chuckles] What?
-Well, it's because…

997
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:18,981
Sang-ho's my friend. He's a nice guy.

998
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:22,234
But he could also
be my competitor, to be honest.

999
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:24,278
-We're rivals.
-Really?

1000
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,822
I don't know if you knew.
Or maybe you did.

1001
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:28,407
But I'm aware of it.

1002
00:39:28,491 --> 00:39:31,035
-I did go on a date with Sang-ho first.
-I know.

1003
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:34,413
And because I know exactly
how Sang-ho feels,

1004
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:36,207
-Yeah.
-I just…

1005
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:38,709
-wanted to shove him out of the way.
-Mmm.

1006
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:41,837
In that case,
you should've tried getting my attention

1007
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,089
and not Sang-ho's.

1008
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:44,548
I had a different plan originally,

1009
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:45,758
-but I messed it up.
-Yeah.

1010
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:46,842
I mean, so…

1011
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:49,553
It's not that I didn't like it, I just…

1012
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:50,638
I get what you mean.

1013
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:52,223
Yeah.

1014
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:53,265
Oh!

1015
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:55,226
-I love that he owned up to it quickly.
-Yeah.

1016
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:57,478
-[Han-na] Good for him.
-I knew Seung-li was my type.

1017
00:39:57,561 --> 00:39:59,188
-[laughs]
-Quick to own up.

1018
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:00,856
-What?
-[Eun-ji] Love a man who owns up.

1019
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,317
It's the right thing to do.
Everyone makes mistakes.

1020
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,986
-That's right.
-Sometimes you can try to make up for it

1021
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,863
-and can actually make it worse!
-Yes, right.

1022
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:10,533
But that just now
was exactly how you do it.

1023
00:40:10,616 --> 00:40:14,745
Yeah, I think our eternal single boys
are not good at catching the girls' hints.

1024
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:16,789
-[Car] Yeah.
-"I'm mad. Stop it." Just like that.

1025
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:17,706
[In-guk] Mm-hmm.

1026
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:20,167
I… Did you read the book today?

1027
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:22,461
-My diary?
-[chuckles softly]

1028
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:24,171
-5 Minute Library?
-I did.

1029
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:27,091
If you read it, then you'd know that

1030
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:28,717
I'm looking for someone

1031
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:31,303
who clearly tells me
what they like and don't like.

1032
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:33,639
-That's why I thought you--
-I saw that.

1033
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:35,224
-Oh, really? Yeah.
-Yeah.

1034
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:38,769
That's why I sincerely thought
you had really hit the mark.

1035
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:40,771
Because right from the very beginning,

1036
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:45,443
you came out and told me you wanted
to go on a date with me.

1037
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:46,485
[Cupids exclaim]

1038
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:49,864
[Ji-su] I thought, "Oh,
I should really try talking to him."

1039
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:53,284
-[both chuckle]
-[Seung-li] I like your honesty.

1040
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:54,326
-Okay.
-Yeah.

1041
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,828
You know, yesterday, I could tell

1042
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:58,164
you hung out a little longer
than usual in the Lounge.

1043
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:01,083
I mean, I tried talking to you,

1044
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:05,171
but the… other competitors
were relentless.

1045
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:06,172
[sighs]

1046
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:10,092
That's why I purposely
kicked the ball towards you.

1047
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:11,135
I thought,

1048
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:13,971
by passing the ball to the guy
that was talking to you,

1049
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:14,930
I'd have my shot.

1050
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:18,142
LAST NIGHT
JI-SU TALKED WITH SANG-HO

1051
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:20,603
AND WITH HYUN-KYU

1052
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:23,147
[Ji-su] Yeah, I thought about it today…

1053
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:24,482
Based on your expression…

1054
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:27,318
There's nothing to think about.
You're a bunch of eternal singles.

1055
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:29,695
What will you do?
You have to win a girl over somehow.

1056
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:31,697
-Can you juggle?
-Yes, of course.

1057
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:32,907
Bam, bam, bam.

1058
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:35,409
[Car] Wow. Hey, that's good.

1059
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:38,996
-[Han-na] Oh, he looks good. Yeah.
-[Eun-ji] He's listening to your advice.

1060
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:39,955
[In-guk] I mean…

1061
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:42,625
Just kick the ball to the guy
who's interested in the same girl.

1062
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:44,543
-Did he do exactly that?
-Wow!

1063
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:45,461
SEUNG-LI

1064
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:47,004
-[Han-na] He's good.
-Yeah, that way.

1065
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:49,423
-[Eun-ji] Whoa!
-[Han-na] He kicked it to her side!

1066
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:51,467
-You can't actually do that.
-He listened to you.

1067
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:54,386
-Hey, you're such an oddball. This is…
-You can't actually do that.

1068
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:57,139
It's funny that you suggested it,
but he actually used that trick.

1069
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:58,224
-[Eun-ji] I know.
-Man!

1070
00:41:58,307 --> 00:42:00,935
-[laughs] Hey, seriously…
-But he actually pulled it off?

1071
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:01,852
[In-guk] Wow.

1072
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:04,855
-[Eun-ji] No way. That's awesome.
-He actually did that. Oh…

1073
00:42:04,939 --> 00:42:07,691
Seung-li has been waging war on his own
since the night before.

1074
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:08,859
-[Car] Yeah.
-Yeah.

1075
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:10,861
With Sang-ho…

1076
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,406
No, but you're popular.

1077
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:16,367
Several girls were interested in you.

1078
00:42:16,951 --> 00:42:18,661
-Interested?
-Yeah.

1079
00:42:18,744 --> 00:42:20,704
You should look around. Yeah.

1080
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:23,290
The thing is, I don't need to look around.

1081
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:24,416
Oh, really?

1082
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:28,629
Honestly, my heart really focuses
on the person I'm interested in.

1083
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:31,298
-I think that's why I get tunnel vision.
-Mmm.

1084
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:35,344
But not everybody is like that, you know?

1085
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:38,973
Some people may feel like
it's a bad thing to like someone more.

1086
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:40,182
[Seung-li] Mm-hmm.

1087
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:42,935
I think I've done it my way for too long.

1088
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:43,852
[Ji-su] What?

1089
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:47,273
What I mean is, I don't have it in me

1090
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:49,108
-to try with too many girls.
-Yeah.

1091
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:52,903
I tend to avoid situations
that might hurt my ego.

1092
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:56,073
So if I were to start doing that now,

1093
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:58,075
I would never get what I wanted.

1094
00:42:58,158 --> 00:42:59,410
Like, before coming here…

1095
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:00,411
Mmm.

1096
00:43:02,329 --> 00:43:03,497
But…

1097
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:07,126
So, like, how do you feel
about things right now?

1098
00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:09,128
Like, how do you feel? Today.

1099
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:10,629
-Right now.
-Today?

1100
00:43:10,713 --> 00:43:12,506
-Yeah.
-Who do I like?

1101
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,383
Well, not about who you like…

1102
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:16,510
Oh, okay.
Well, you can talk about that too.

1103
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,554
Right now, honestly… [sighs]

1104
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:23,350
I'm stuck between Sang-ho,
Hyun-kyu, and you.

1105
00:43:24,226 --> 00:43:25,686
Like I said before.

1106
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:27,813
-I really like all of you.
-Okay.

1107
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:29,940
But it's also really difficult

1108
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:31,525
-to rank you guys.
-Hmm.

1109
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:32,985
[mellow music playing]

1110
00:43:33,068 --> 00:43:34,862
Such different vibes.

1111
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:36,322
-They really are, huh?
-Mmm.

1112
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:39,033
-We all have our own thing.
-Mmm.

1113
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:42,161
-Your personalities are different too.
-Mm-hmm.

1114
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:44,496
[Seung-li] Today, I felt

1115
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:48,459
like my feelings towards Ji-su
became even stronger than before.

1116
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:51,503
My top choice is definitely still Ji-su.

1117
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:54,590
It may sound kind of selfish,

1118
00:43:54,673 --> 00:43:57,176
but I keep talking about three guys.

1119
00:43:57,926 --> 00:44:00,262
Actually, I said I like people
who give me assurance,

1120
00:44:00,346 --> 00:44:01,513
but I'm still unsure.

1121
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:05,184
All three of them
are really such great guys.

1122
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:08,604
I've been thinking about this so much,
my head's gonna explode.

1123
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:10,939
I think I might know by tomorrow.

1124
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:12,316
Or the day after?

1125
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:14,610
I feel so bad for them.

1126
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:17,613
That's not selfish at all.

1127
00:44:17,696 --> 00:44:19,156
[Car] What Ji-su said is very true.

1128
00:44:19,239 --> 00:44:20,699
She's got to be very careful,

1129
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:23,285
especially since
she's been single her whole life.

1130
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:26,413
She's looking for someone
to finally call her boyfriend,

1131
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:29,500
but she has to be careful and get to
know them before making a move.

1132
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:31,168
That's exactly why she's here.

1133
00:44:32,961 --> 00:44:34,713
-I know we talked yesterday…
-Yeah.

1134
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:36,590
-…but I wanted to talk more.
-Oh, really?

1135
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:38,050
What did you want to talk about?

1136
00:44:38,133 --> 00:44:40,719
Uh, I didn't have
anything particular in mind.

1137
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:43,514
-[Eun-ji] They're so Gyeongsang Province.
-[Han-na] Mmm.

1138
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:47,685
Uh, what… what type of personality
are you looking for in a guy?

1139
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:51,563
Someone rational?
A serious guy? Someone funny?

1140
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:53,273
-[Mi-ji] Uh…
-Or maybe…

1141
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:57,111
Or both… I like to joke around
whenever I feel happy and stuff, but--

1142
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:58,320
[Mi-ji] Oh. See, I wanted…

1143
00:44:59,321 --> 00:45:02,449
somebody that… I could talk to easily.

1144
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:03,992
-[Sang-ho] Mmm.
-Yeah. I just…

1145
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:05,160
-[Sang-ho] But…
-Yeah.

1146
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:09,039
This is… kind of a sad question but…

1147
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:10,582
-Yeah.
-…how would you feel

1148
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:13,544
-if you leave without a partner?
-Leave without a partner?

1149
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:16,130
-I already don't like my odds.
-Was that question too harsh?

1150
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:19,716
Honestly, I really… I worry about it.

1151
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,302
-Were you thinking about that?
-What?

1152
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:23,887
That's what's on your mind?

1153
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:25,139
I guess.

1154
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:26,598
I'm not very confident.

1155
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:29,685
-Mmm?
-Do I sound less confident?

1156
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:31,728
-Oh, no, no, no. It's just…
-Oh, really?

1157
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:34,314
Everyone can feel that way
from time to time.

1158
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:36,400
Damn, I'm even struggling
with this meal they made.

1159
00:45:36,483 --> 00:45:37,901
-Wait, why?
-No, I just…

1160
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:39,778
It was… I was only joking.

1161
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:41,655
It's like a… metaphor.

1162
00:45:41,738 --> 00:45:42,739
Ah!

1163
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:45,200
-[chuckles] I thought you meant--
-No, not this table.

1164
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:47,035
So, what's your question, Sang-ho?

1165
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:49,913
-Okay, so, what am I trying to say?
-[chuckles softly]

1166
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:51,957
I know I wanted to say something, but…

1167
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:54,960
[Mi-ji] Sang-ho seemed to be very nervous

1168
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:57,296
during our entire conversation. I just…

1169
00:45:57,379 --> 00:45:59,548
-Okay, own a house or rent?
-What?

1170
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:01,383
Ugh, I'm being so random right now.

1171
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:03,010
What? Me?

1172
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:04,595
-It wouldn't be every day…
-Huh?

1173
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:06,722
-You said you liked this, right?
-Huh?

1174
00:46:06,805 --> 00:46:08,599
-We'd say a word each day?
-Huh?

1175
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:10,809
[Han-na and Car laughing]

1176
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:14,521
Was that a question
or is he just talking to himself?

1177
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:15,522
Not a chemistry issue.

1178
00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:16,940
-She can't understand him.
-What?

1179
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:19,401
-She's so lost.
-[Han-na] She can't understand anything.

1180
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:22,237
You also, like…
You're interested in, but you won't say…

1181
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:24,198
-What does that mean?
-You don't talk about it.

1182
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:26,241
[Mi-ji] Our conversations
won't get better.

1183
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:29,786
I tried so hard to connect
and find him charming.

1184
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:31,330
But… [chuckles]

1185
00:46:32,122 --> 00:46:33,415
We're from the same…

1186
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:35,083
region.

1187
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:36,835
But that's it. So, yeah.

1188
00:46:37,336 --> 00:46:38,337
BOWLING DATE

1189
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:41,131
[Han-na] Do, Jeong-mok,
Hyun-kyu, and Yeo-myung's date.

1190
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:43,091
-[upbeat music playing]
-Hyun-kyu.

1191
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:44,635
-Hey.
-Let's go together.

1192
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:46,803
-Are the others not here?
-No.

1193
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:48,639
-I guess we're here first.
-Will you drive?

1194
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:50,807
-Maybe. You wanna drive?
-Oh, I guess… I can drive.

1195
00:46:50,891 --> 00:46:52,726
Okay. That makes me your copilot.

1196
00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:53,936
Really? Okay.

1197
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:56,522
-Nice.
-Where are they?

1198
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:57,523
[Yeo-myung] So nice.

1199
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:03,403
PARK JI-YEON
YI DO

1200
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:04,821
-[music fades]
-[creaks]

1201
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:06,615
-Oh, God! Hey there.
-Let's go.

1202
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:08,534
I wasn't expecting you.

1203
00:47:08,617 --> 00:47:10,744
-[Car] Wow, hey.
-[Han-na] What is this?

1204
00:47:11,703 --> 00:47:13,205
Did they leave us?

1205
00:47:13,288 --> 00:47:14,623
-In the car.
-Oh, in the car?

1206
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:15,874
-Let's hurry.
-Take your time.

1207
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:17,960
-They already look like a couple.
-[Car] That's it.

1208
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:20,337
-Now, this is a date.
-[Car] That's it right there.

1209
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:24,091
[Do] I'm sorry I'm late.
I thought we were meeting at half past.

1210
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:26,218
-[Yeo-myung] You're fine.
-[Hyun-kyu] No worries.

1211
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:28,554
-[Jeong-mok] Shall we go?
-[Do] Let's go!

1212
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:30,639
[pleasant music playing]

1213
00:47:31,306 --> 00:47:34,351
I always thought, you know,
going bowling on a double date

1214
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:37,312
has been a dream of mine
for as long as I can remember.

1215
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:40,857
-I had totally forgotten about that.
-So I'm really excited right now!

1216
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:42,901
I literally feel like I'm on cloud nine.

1217
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:43,944
It's been a while

1218
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:45,862
-since I did something fun.
-Right?

1219
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:48,407
That's why I wore something loose.
Something I can move in.

1220
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:49,616
[Jeong-mok] A bowling shirt?

1221
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,702
-Oh, it's actually a sweatshirt.
-A sweatshirt.

1222
00:47:51,785 --> 00:47:55,998
Honestly, bowling was a really good idea
because it's way too hot outside.

1223
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:57,833
-Then we should've switched seats.
-Why?

1224
00:47:57,916 --> 00:48:00,711
-Sun is hitting you on that side.
-It's okay. Don't worry about it.

1225
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:02,254
We'll change directions soon.

1226
00:48:05,924 --> 00:48:07,676
[Eun-ji] Jeong-mok
is doing something again.

1227
00:48:07,759 --> 00:48:10,971
-[Car] What's he gonna do for her now?
-[Han-na] Is he trying to help?

1228
00:48:11,888 --> 00:48:12,723
Hyun-kyu.

1229
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:15,642
Is the button
for the back seat AC up there?

1230
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:17,853
-Button for what?
-Can't you turn it on back there?

1231
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:19,980
-No, it's not back here.
-There isn't one. A button?

1232
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:21,815
-[Hyun-kyu] First we have to…
-In the front?

1233
00:48:21,898 --> 00:48:24,026
The button for the seat heater
is in the back.

1234
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:25,652
[Yeo-myung] That's the seat heater.

1235
00:48:25,736 --> 00:48:27,946
Jeong-mok was controlling
the AC in the back

1236
00:48:28,030 --> 00:48:30,866
just to make sure I felt comfortable.

1237
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:32,159
[charming music playing]

1238
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:33,619
That really impressed me.

1239
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:40,500
[Eun-ji] Why is he so indifferent?

1240
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:42,210
-What's his deal?
-[Car] Oh, wow.

1241
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:48,342
I'm really glad
I get to go on a date with you.

1242
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:49,259
Why?

1243
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:51,803
Because I kept telling myself,

1244
00:48:53,055 --> 00:48:55,557
"I should have
at least one date with him."

1245
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:57,267
And today's the day.

1246
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:03,440
BOWLING ALLEY

1247
00:49:03,523 --> 00:49:05,067
-[Do] Hey!
-[contestants] Hello.

1248
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:06,151
[staff] Hi, welcome.

-[music fades]
-[Hyun-kyu inhales, exhales sharply]

1250
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:11,031
I won't be too competitive. [chuckles]

1251
00:49:11,865 --> 00:49:13,742
[Do] Should we bet on drinks?

1252
00:49:13,825 --> 00:49:15,160
Let's bet on a meal instead.

1253
00:49:15,243 --> 00:49:17,037
-Let's do that.
-[Do] Okay, a meal it is!

1254
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,830
-[Yeo-myung] Okay. Great.
-[Hyun-kyu] Nice.

1255
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:20,916

[ball thuds]

1257
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:25,379
[Do] Nice! Okay. Let's go.

1258
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:26,588
-You got it!
-[Hyun-kyu] Oh!

1259
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:27,923
-You got it!
-[Jeong-mok] Oh!

1260
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:29,925
-[Do laughs]
-[Hyun-kyu] That will…

1261
00:49:30,008 --> 00:49:31,510
give them quite the lead.

1262
00:49:31,593 --> 00:49:32,969
-[Yeo-myung] Really?
-Yes!

1263
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:34,429
-Hmm. Good luck.
-Yeah!

1264
00:49:35,263 --> 00:49:36,640
You got this, girl!

1265
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:37,724
[Hyun-kyu] Let's go!

1266
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:39,559
-[Do] Oh!
-Oh, hey!

1267
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:40,477
[Hyun-kyu] Oh!

-[Hyun-kyu] Awesome, awesome, awesome!

1269
00:49:45,607 --> 00:49:48,985
-Oh, we're actually catching up. Let's go!
-Mmm.

1271
00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:54,199
-[Do] Wow!
-[Hyun-kyu] Oh, wow! Strike.

1272
00:49:54,282 --> 00:49:56,743
-[Do] That was incredible!
-Awesome, awesome, awesome.

1273
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:59,287
[Do] Hey, you have to do well
in the next round. Get a strike.

1274
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:00,831
[Yeo-myung] Two, three.

00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:03,250
-[Jeong-mok] Oh!
-[Do] Oh!

1277
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:07,045
-Hey, he's really good at this.
-He's pretty good.

1278
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:10,340
-How does he play like that?
-Why isn't anyone high-fiving Hyun-kyu?

1279
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:13,051
-[laughs] You're right.
-[Han-na] Oh, that's so sad.

Oh, no.

1283
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:19,683
[Jeong-mok] Nice try.

1284
00:50:19,766 --> 00:50:22,477
-[Hyun-kyu] Good try. You got this.
-It's okay. Yeah.

1285
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:24,855
-I'm so sorry about that.
-No worries.

1286
00:50:26,064 --> 00:50:28,775
-[Yeo-myung] We're doing great.
-Don't worry. I'll get it next time.

1287
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:31,111
Oh, that's the confidence we like!

-[Jeong-mok] Oh!
-[Hyun-kyu] Down the middle!

1290
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:37,993
-[Do] Wow!
-[Jeong-mok] What?

1291
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:38,910
Wow, wow!

1292
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:40,120
-Wow!
-[Jeong-mok] What?

1293
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:41,246
Wow, wow!

1294
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:43,540
-Yeah!
-[Yeo-myung] What was that?

1295
00:50:43,623 --> 00:50:45,125
[enchanting music playing]

1296
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:46,042
[Do] Actually,

1297
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:49,212
one thing that was on my dating wish list

1298
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:52,174
was to have a double date
at a bowling alley.

1299
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:56,511
I was so incredibly excited
and also very nervous.

1300
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:59,389
My heart was literally pounding.

1301
00:50:59,473 --> 00:51:00,682
Let's go, Jeong-mok.

1302
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:01,725
I got this.

1303
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:03,226
[Yeo-myung chuckles]

1304
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:04,895
[Do] Okay!

1305
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:06,813
Go, go.

1306
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:07,731
[Jeong-mok] Oh!

1307
00:51:07,814 --> 00:51:09,566
Oh, it only needed a bit more power.

1308
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:11,735
-It's okay. Get a spare. You got this.
-You got this.

1309
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:13,487
-We need to be faster.
-You did great.

1310
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:15,489
You guys, there's no need to rush things.

1311
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:17,115
-Aw. He missed it.
-Oh, no.

1312
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:18,200
He moved the pin!

1313
00:51:18,283 --> 00:51:19,993
-Oh, nice. I like that.
-Look.

1314
00:51:20,076 --> 00:51:22,662
-So, that pin, that's on the right side.
-[Eun-ji] There we go.

1315
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:26,666
You see how it's crooked? That means that
the computer counts it as a point.

1316
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,376
Actually, that makes the shot harder.

1317
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:30,420
-Just try throwing it really hard.
-I'm on it.

1318
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:31,338
Okay.

1319
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:35,217
[ball thuds]

1320
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:38,178
-Nice!
-[Yeo-myung laughing] She said, "Nice."

1321
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:39,805
-[laughter]
-Why are you laughing?

1322
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:42,307
Honestly, that sounded kind of fake.

1323
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:44,392
Well, I'm trying to cheer him on!

1324
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:46,686
-He's happy right now.
-[Han-na] He's glowing!

1325
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:48,730
Jeong-mok is always smiling.

1326
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:51,191
Do is definitely different
from when she was with Seung-li.

1327
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:54,277
-This is Do's real personality.
-[Car] Yeah, you're right.

1328
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:55,904
-[chuckles]
-[Do] Oh?

1329
00:51:56,571 --> 00:51:57,572
[ball thuds]

1330
00:51:57,656 --> 00:51:58,990
[Hyun-kyu] It's good. It's good.

1331
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:00,534
Great throw! Down the middle!

1332
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:01,660
[Hyun-kyu chuckles]

1333
00:52:01,743 --> 00:52:02,828
Good job. Good job.

1334
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:05,789
Since we're probably gonna lose,
should we pick the food?

1335
00:52:05,872 --> 00:52:08,166
[Hyun-kyu] If you hit that last one
you'll get a spare.

1336
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:10,460
Do you want Korean food? Rice?

1337
00:52:11,127 --> 00:52:13,296
-Or stews and barbecue?
-[Jeong-mok] I'd be down.

1338
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:15,924
Hello, pay attention, please.

1339
00:52:16,007 --> 00:52:18,009
Western food could be good.

1340
00:52:18,093 --> 00:52:19,553
Or pork cutlets?

1341
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:21,555
-How about spicy pork?
-One, two…

1342
00:52:21,638 --> 00:52:23,849
-[Jeong-mok] But do we get to pick?
-…three. [grunts]

1343
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:26,226
-[Hyun-kyu] It's okay.
-[Jeong-mok] What do you wanna eat?

1344
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:27,894
[tense music playing]

1345
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:32,399
We started off playing together, but then
they just talked amongst themselves.

1346
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:33,650
It bummed me out.

1347
00:52:34,192 --> 00:52:35,777
And you know, the length?

1348
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:38,446
If you look here,
everyone's palms have a different length.

1349
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:39,656
So you have to get fitted.

1350
00:52:39,739 --> 00:52:43,201
These can hurt your hand here,
and, like, they sometimes swivel around.

1351
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:44,452
But if you do this,

1352
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:46,830
-it'll pretty much throw itself.
-Let's go!

1353
00:52:46,913 --> 00:52:47,831
Cheer for us.

1354
00:52:47,914 --> 00:52:50,542
-No. I can't do that.
-Cheer for us. Cheer for us.

1355
00:52:51,209 --> 00:52:52,919
[Do] Good job, everyone.

1356
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:58,008
-[Hyun-kyu] We won by three points.
-[Do] Three points.

1357
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:00,343
We won! We won! [chuckles]

1358
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:01,469
Congratulations.

1359
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:02,512
-Yes.
-Good game.

1360
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:04,264
-Great game, guys.
-[Hyun-kyu] Nice.

1361
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:06,641
-[Do] Great game. Great game.
-[music fades]

1362
00:53:07,225 --> 00:53:09,019
[Yeo-myung] We're finally gonna eat meat.

1363
00:53:09,102 --> 00:53:11,771
-[Hyun-kyu] I'm so excited.
-I'm so happy. I'm starving.

1364
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:13,607
-Oh, it smells good.
-Same.

1365
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:15,400
[cell phones chiming]

1366
00:53:15,483 --> 00:53:16,985
-[Do] What?
-[Jeong-mok] Huh?

1367
00:53:17,068 --> 00:53:18,528
[upbeat music playing]

1368
00:53:18,612 --> 00:53:20,572
-What?
-The dinners are meant to be one-on-one.

1369
00:53:20,655 --> 00:53:22,115
-We're eating separately.
-Really?

1370
00:53:22,198 --> 00:53:24,117
It's like being together but separate.

1371
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:29,080
[Jeong-mok] Finally, I get the chance
to talk with her one-on-one.

1372
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:31,458
I was really hoping I could use this time

1373
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:34,377
to make some real progress
in our relationship.

1374
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:36,004
I am so happy that

1375
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:38,924
we finally get to sit down
and talk one-on-one.

1376
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:42,177
I finally get to talk to Jeong-mok
just like I wanted.

1377
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:43,845
I was extremely excited.

1378
00:53:45,221 --> 00:53:46,056
[Do] Mmm.

1379
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:53,021
[music fades]

1380
00:53:53,104 --> 00:53:54,981
-[Hyun-kyu chuckles]
-This looks good.

1381
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:57,609
[Han-na] Wait, they're…
right in Yeo-myung's line of view.

1382
00:53:57,692 --> 00:53:59,069
[Car] Isn't that too cruel?

1383
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:01,780
[Eun-ji] Why don't they change seats?

1384
00:54:01,863 --> 00:54:02,906
[Car] Oh, this is…

1385
00:54:02,989 --> 00:54:05,825
-[Hyun-kyu] Did you look at the menu?
-What… what should we eat?

1386
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:07,535
[somber music playing]

1387
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:08,745
[sighs]

1388
00:54:08,828 --> 00:54:10,038
I'm kinda sad.

1389
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:15,418
I really wanted to talk to Jeong-mok,
but I never got a chance to.

1390
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:19,506
I kept glancing over at him
during our entire dinner,

1391
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:22,092
because he was
directly in my line of sight.

1392
00:54:22,175 --> 00:54:23,927
[Han-na] This is so uncomfortable.

1393
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:26,304
-[Jeong-mok] How was today?
-Bowling?

1394
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:28,181
-Bowling.
-I had so much fun.

1395
00:54:28,974 --> 00:54:30,016
[Do chuckles]

1396
00:54:31,267 --> 00:54:33,436
-Ready to order?
-We'll have one black pork chop set,

1397
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,271
-one soju, and one beer.
-Okay.

1398
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:36,982
[waiter] Which soju and beer?

1399
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:39,442
[Hyun-kyu] Oh, do…
do you have a preference?

1400
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:41,236
[chuckling] I'm joking.

1401
00:54:41,319 --> 00:54:43,405
Should we have some soju?

1402
00:54:43,488 --> 00:54:45,991
-I thought you didn't like soju.
-No, let's just have soju.

1403
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:48,618
Excuse me. We don't need the beer.
Just the soju, please.

1404
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:50,453
-[waiter] Is the light one fine? Okay.
-Yes.

1405
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:52,497
-You want… soju?
-[Yeo-myung] Of course.

1406
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:57,794
Was there someone
you were hoping would pick you today?

1407
00:54:57,877 --> 00:55:00,380
-Someone I hoped would pick me?
-Yeah.

1408
00:55:01,339 --> 00:55:03,633
-Of course, there was someone…
-[Hyun-kyu] I was curious.

1409
00:55:03,717 --> 00:55:07,178
…I'm interested in,
and I wish they'd picked me.

1410
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:10,682
However, I'm being really careful…

1411
00:55:10,765 --> 00:55:12,058
-Mmm.
-…because…

1412
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:14,561
[soft wistful music playing]

1413
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:16,021
[inaudible]

1414
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:21,818
[chuckles] You know what I mean? So…

1415
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:25,488
I'd rather not know.

1416
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:27,615
"Ignorance is bliss" type of thing.

1417
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:29,576
-You feel me? [chuckles]
-But…

1418
00:55:30,368 --> 00:55:33,163
[Yeo-myung] Currently,
my top choice is Jeong-mok.

1419
00:55:33,246 --> 00:55:35,165
That hasn't changed at all.

1420
00:55:35,248 --> 00:55:37,375
But now, I keep wondering,

1421
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:40,336
"When will we get to talk one-on-one?"

1422
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,423
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

1423
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:45,383
[music fades]

1424
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:47,844
I guess they're drinking.

1425
00:55:47,927 --> 00:55:48,845
[Do] Oh, really?

1426
00:55:51,931 --> 00:55:53,516
-Just like--
-Is it a whole set?

1427
00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:55,226
-The diadem?
-The set?

1428
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:57,270
Oh, I just thought today,

1429
00:55:57,353 --> 00:55:59,105
-"I should wear this."
-You decided today?

1430
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:00,774
Oh, I thought about this yesterday.

1431
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:03,568
I'm clumsy, so I'm always careful
when I'm wearing white.

1432
00:56:03,651 --> 00:56:05,528
Because I always spill things.

1433
00:56:05,612 --> 00:56:08,156
-I dressed up quite a bit today.
-Your outfit is so white.

1434
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:09,949
-Oh, really?
-Yeah, this is me dressing up.

1435
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:12,410
White… looks good on you.

1436
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:13,328
Huh?

1437
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:15,413
White looks really good on you.

1438
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:17,040
Oh, really? Thanks.

1439
00:56:17,123 --> 00:56:18,583
[charming music playing]

1440
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:20,001
Why'd you dress up?

1441
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:22,003
I just wanted to look pretty today.

1442
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:23,421
-Yeah. I wanted to…
-Special day?

1443
00:56:23,505 --> 00:56:26,049
…dress up and look the prettiest
I possibly could.

1444
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:30,470
[Eun-ji] Jeong-mok really likes
Her bubbly and sweet personality.

1445
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:32,430
[Car] He's really into it.

1446
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:34,349
[Do] Thank you. Let's eat.

1447
00:56:42,941 --> 00:56:44,609
[chokes, coughs]

1448
00:56:44,692 --> 00:56:45,610
[Jeong-mok] You okay?

1449
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:47,695
It's too big!

1450
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:49,864
It is pretty big. Shall we cut them up?

1451
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:50,907
[Do chuckles]

1452
00:56:51,616 --> 00:56:53,618
Where'd he go? Ah.

1453
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,578
I really can't eat it.

1454
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:56,871
It's so big.

1455
00:56:57,413 --> 00:56:58,540
I won't look.

1456
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:00,959
[Han-na] Oh, so she can spit it out? Aw.

1457
00:57:01,042 --> 00:57:03,086
-[Do chuckling]
-[mellow music playing]

1458
00:57:03,169 --> 00:57:04,796
[Jeong-mok] Shall I cut it up?

1459
00:57:05,421 --> 00:57:07,757
[Do chuckling] It is… really big.

1460
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:12,512
I mean, when they brought it out,
I thought, "It's kind of big."

1461
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:16,349
-[Jeong-mok] I'll cut them all.
-Oh, thanks.

1462
00:57:17,308 --> 00:57:18,434
Oh.

1463
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:19,769
Oh, thanks.

1464
00:57:19,853 --> 00:57:20,895
Mmm.

1465
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:24,190
It's tastier in smaller pieces.
I can actually taste the flavors.

1466
00:57:24,899 --> 00:57:26,693
[Do] During our dinner, I realized

1467
00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:29,863
that whenever I'm struggling
with something,

1468
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:33,366
Jeong-mok always quietly observes,

1469
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:35,243
and always tries to help me.

1470
00:57:35,326 --> 00:57:36,578
-Last time, I crashed.
-[gasps]

1471
00:57:36,661 --> 00:57:37,787
-Hyun-kyu.
-I got banged up.

1472
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:40,039
Is the button
for the back seat AC up there?

1473
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:42,959
I'm so sorry about that.

1474
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:45,170
No need to worry. I'll get it next time.

1475
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:46,713
I really can't eat it.

1476
00:57:46,796 --> 00:57:47,797
It's so big.

1477
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:50,383
[Do] Thinking back to the previous days,

1478
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:51,718
I came to realize that

1479
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:56,014
Jeong-mok went out of his way
to try and help me yesterday.

1480
00:57:56,806 --> 00:57:59,267
-[Jeong-mok] Try it like this.
-How do I open this?

1481
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:01,186
-Should I just tear it?
-[Jae-yun] Yeah.

1482
00:58:01,936 --> 00:58:04,063
-I've only done one task here.
-Oh, no.

1483
00:58:04,939 --> 00:58:06,816
Does anyone need a straw?

1484
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:09,819
-I'm gonna get some from the Lounge.
-You could trip with those shoes.

1485
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:11,237
-[Do] Oh, but I--
-I'll go.

1486
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:15,950
[Do] Oh, has he been
interested in me this whole time?

1487
00:58:17,702 --> 00:58:20,663
He's been…
taking care of Do this whole time.

1488
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:23,291
Oh, I love it
when guys are caring like that.

1489
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:27,212
Oh, goodness. I like Jeong-mok too.

1490
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:29,756
Are you now… teetering between
Seung-li and Jeong-mok?

1491
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:32,467
I think I'm Team Jeong-mok.
I like Jeong-mok so much.

1492
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:35,720
I… I can't… I can't choose yet.
I'll just choose on Day 5.

1493
00:58:35,803 --> 00:58:37,430
[laughing]

1494
00:58:39,807 --> 00:58:42,936
You knew I'd choose you, right?
Actually, I said so yesterday.

1495
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:44,270
Kind of? True.

1496
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:47,565
But I wasn't entirely sure.
You could've changed your mind overnight.

1497
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:49,567
Oh. I don't think I would've.

1498
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:53,738
-I did my best.
-Mmm.

1499
00:58:57,784 --> 00:58:59,369
So your favorite movie…

1500
00:59:02,664 --> 00:59:03,915
is Pride & Prejudice?

1501
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:05,959
[Eun-ji] Oh, my!

1502
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:07,544
[enchanting music playing]

1503
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:08,670
Did I tell you that?

1504
00:59:08,753 --> 00:59:10,922
I… I read your diary this morning.

1505
00:59:12,674 --> 00:59:14,467
5 Minute Library? Ah.

1506
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:16,261
-[Eun-ji and Han-na] Ah!
-Wow! This guy.

1507
00:59:16,344 --> 00:59:17,387
This guy.

1508
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:20,056
-Wait. Time-out.
-For a moment, I also thought, "Oh, my."

1509
00:59:20,139 --> 00:59:22,308
-[Han-na] You feel something?
-My heart felt a bit…

1510
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:24,269
-Wait. Why are you feeling like that?
-Because…

1511
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:25,478
[Eun-ji] Why you guys?

1512
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:27,897
-I can't help it.
-Come on, he's so cool!

1513
00:59:27,981 --> 00:59:30,149
-[Eun-ji] Yeah.
-"I read your diary this morning." Wow.

1514
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:33,653
"I read your diary, and in it,
you mentioned your favorite movie."

1515
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:35,154
I mean, that's cool!

1516
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:37,782
-That's a smart move.
-We'd go, "I see." Right.

1517
00:59:37,865 --> 00:59:40,326
-"This is your favorite movie, right?"
-"Oh, did I tell you?"

1518
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:41,995
"No, I read it in your diary."

1519
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:43,246
-Oh.
-Powerful!

1520
00:59:44,163 --> 00:59:45,623
I love his choice of words.

1521
00:59:45,707 --> 00:59:47,834
-"Choice of words."
-[Eun-ji] I do as well.

1522
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:49,961
-He's good at giving you butterflies.
-[Eun-ji] Yes.

1523
00:59:50,044 --> 00:59:52,005
-I think you definitely mentored him well.
-Yes.

1524
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:54,215
Oh, I never taught him things like that.

1525
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:56,759
-What happened to him?
-[Han-na] Is he using his instincts?

1526
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:58,094
He doesn't need me now.

1527
00:59:58,177 --> 00:59:59,137
[exclaims]

1528
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:00,305
He's doing so well.

1529
01:00:00,388 --> 01:00:01,723
[Cupids exclaim]

1530
01:00:02,307 --> 01:00:04,017
Looks like you really read through it.

1531
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:06,060
I really took my time to read it.

1532
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:08,021
-I see.
-But now, I'm drawing a blank.

1533
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:10,273
What was your favorite food again?

1534
01:00:10,356 --> 01:00:12,317
Fresh cream cake, or something?

1535
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:14,861
-Ah… that's right.
-There was something really specific.

1536
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:18,781
You're right. Fresh cream cake
as well as iced lattes.

1537
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:19,824
Right. I read that.

1538
01:00:19,907 --> 01:00:20,992
-Iced lattes. Yes.
-Really?

1539
01:00:21,659 --> 01:00:22,619
[laughs]

1540
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:23,578
I see.

1541
01:00:23,661 --> 01:00:25,913
Those two things together are my favorite.

1542
01:00:25,997 --> 01:00:27,457
-I also saw…
-What?

1543
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:29,250
…something like iced latte in Laotian…

1544
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:30,501
In Laotian.

1545
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:33,254
[in Laotian] "Iced latte
with no sugar." [laughs]

1546
01:00:34,172 --> 01:00:36,090
-[in English] You're good.
-[both chuckle]

1547
01:00:36,174 --> 01:00:38,801
-I need to be able to say it to buy it.
-You do.

1548
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:41,763
[Do] Wasn't there
something about matching items?

1549
01:00:41,846 --> 01:00:43,598
-Matching items?
-I want matching rings.

1550
01:00:43,681 --> 01:00:45,683
-Yeah. Matching rings for sure.
-Really? I see.

1551
01:00:46,267 --> 01:00:48,519
What do you think is reasonable
for matching rings?

1552
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:50,521
-What? The price?
-If you've just met-- No, no.

1553
01:00:50,605 --> 01:00:51,898
-Talking price now?
-I'm sorry.

1554
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:54,108
You asked,
"What do you think is reasonable?"

1555
01:00:54,192 --> 01:00:56,694
[Jeong-mok] Right. I meant
how long after starting to date.

1556
01:00:56,778 --> 01:00:59,113
[Do] Oh, I'm not
thinking about Seung-li at all.

1557
01:00:59,197 --> 01:01:00,490
Unlike yesterday,

1558
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:02,492
I actually haven't…

1559
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:04,702
thought about him at all.

1560
01:01:04,786 --> 01:01:06,204
It got me thinking,

1561
01:01:06,287 --> 01:01:08,373
"Could it be because of Jeong-mok?"

1562
01:01:08,456 --> 01:01:10,375
[enchanting music playing]

1563
01:01:10,917 --> 01:01:11,918
[Car] Oh, wow!

1564
01:01:12,001 --> 01:01:14,337
-[In-guk] He suddenly looks so handsome.
-[Car] Yeah.

1565
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:17,382
-He looks so cool!
-[In-guk] What was that angle just now?

1566
01:01:17,465 --> 01:01:18,966
Now that I'm really seeing him,

1567
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:21,177
I think Jeong-mok
has a great face for Netflix.

1568
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:24,389
-Yes. He does have a Netflix face.
-Yes, he has a Netflix face.

1569
01:01:24,472 --> 01:01:25,640
Why is he so cool?

1570
01:01:25,723 --> 01:01:27,016
He's pulling at my heartstrings.

1571
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:29,310
-Why are you feeling that way?
-I'm getting butterflies.

1572
01:01:29,394 --> 01:01:31,854
-You're pulling your chair up.
-Oh, he's making me crazy.

1573
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:34,232
-I'm learning so much from this guy.
-[Han-na] I love it.

1574
01:01:34,315 --> 01:01:36,025
So if things keep going this way,

1575
01:01:36,109 --> 01:01:38,695
they'll probably end up becoming
an actual couple.

1576
01:01:38,778 --> 01:01:40,405
-[Car] Yeah, I think so.
-Right? Yeah.

1577
01:01:40,488 --> 01:01:42,615
These two need
to start dating immediately.

1578
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:43,825
ATV DATE

1579
01:01:43,908 --> 01:01:46,077
-[Seung-chan] Wow, this is amazing.
-[Ji-yeon] So cool.

1580
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:49,205
-[Seung-chan and Min-hong] Hello.
-[man] Welcome. Come this way.

1581
01:01:49,288 --> 01:01:52,333
-Ji-yeon must not be enjoying this date.
-[In-guk] She's sort of mad.

1582
01:01:52,417 --> 01:01:53,334
Mmm.

1583
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:57,088
-[Ji-yeon] Oh, this is scary.
-Guys can be in the front.

1584
01:01:57,171 --> 01:01:58,715
-Need a hand?
-[Ji-yeon] Hang on.

1585
01:01:58,798 --> 01:02:00,717
-Need a hand?
-[man] Girls can ride in the back.

1586
01:02:01,592 --> 01:02:03,219
-[Ji-yeon gasps]
-Careful.

1587
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:05,221
[Ji-yeon] No, it's okay.

1588
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:07,724
[enchanting music playing]

1589
01:02:09,142 --> 01:02:10,685
[man] Everyone, scoot up a bit.

1590
01:02:10,768 --> 01:02:11,894
Yes, up.

1591
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:12,812
Up. Up.

1592
01:02:15,606 --> 01:02:17,734
-Okay. Grab the brakes.
-I'm holding on.

1593
01:02:20,653 --> 01:02:22,488
-[man] Grab the brakes.
-[Min-hong] That okay?

1594
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:24,782
-Me too.
-[man] Okay, guys. Hold them down.

1595
01:02:24,866 --> 01:02:26,576
Oh, what if Jae-yun passes out?

1596
01:02:26,659 --> 01:02:28,327
[Han-na] Ji-yeon must be nervous.

1597
01:02:28,411 --> 01:02:29,787
[Ji-yeon] Let's go!

1598
01:02:30,788 --> 01:02:32,498
[Min-hong] Oh, I'm so scared.

1599
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:34,584
[enthralling music playing]

1600
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:40,548
Do you like activities like this?

1601
01:02:40,631 --> 01:02:42,216
Me? I really love them.

1602
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:43,176
[Min-hong] I see.

1603
01:02:43,259 --> 01:02:45,720
I was a little hesitant
because of the weather.

1604
01:02:45,803 --> 01:02:47,221
-[Min-hong] Right.
-But I love it.

1605
01:02:47,305 --> 01:02:48,765
I totally love riding ATVs.

1606
01:02:48,848 --> 01:02:51,601
[Min-hong] I wasn't too excited
because I was scared.

1607
01:02:51,684 --> 01:02:54,562
-Oh, really? Oh…
-But honestly, it's really not that bad.

1608
01:02:54,645 --> 01:02:56,105
[Seung-chan] It's not even that hot.

1609
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:58,775
-[Min-hong] And this breeze feels so good.
-[Seung-chan] Yeah.

1610
01:02:58,858 --> 01:03:00,359
[Ji-yeon] This is crazy.

1611
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:01,527
It's my first time.

1612
01:03:02,361 --> 01:03:03,905
Oh, this is fun.

1613
01:03:03,988 --> 01:03:05,823
[engine revving]

1614
01:03:05,907 --> 01:03:07,992
-What?
-[Jae-yun] Oh, we're going in here?

1615
01:03:08,075 --> 01:03:10,828
-Could be a little shaky. Hold on tight.
-It's okay. Oh, okay.

1616
01:03:10,912 --> 01:03:11,954
Oh!

1617
01:03:13,331 --> 01:03:14,957
Oh, my God.

1618
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:20,171
[both exclaiming]

1619
01:03:20,254 --> 01:03:22,965
This is fun. I got this!
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

1620
01:03:23,049 --> 01:03:25,468
-Ji-yeon's anger has melted away.
-[Han-na exclaims]

1621
01:03:25,551 --> 01:03:27,553
[Ji-yeon] Oh, this is awesome!

1622
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:30,556
[sighs happily] Oh, I love it.
I love this place!

1623
01:03:31,516 --> 01:03:34,143
[Ji-yeon] Honestly,
after what happened this morning,

1624
01:03:34,685 --> 01:03:35,853
I just really…

1625
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:38,731
wasn't feeling up for any kind of date.

1626
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:41,108
That's actually why I looked so upset.

1627
01:03:41,192 --> 01:03:44,695
But it was my first time riding an ATV,

1628
01:03:44,779 --> 01:03:46,072
and it had been a while

1629
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:49,951
since I was able to leave work
and the rest of my worries behind.

1630
01:03:50,701 --> 01:03:53,913
In that moment,
I felt completely free and alive.

1631
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:56,541
[Min-hong] It kinda feels like
a jungle, doesn't it?

1632
01:03:56,624 --> 01:03:58,125
[Seung-chan] Yeah, it does.

1633
01:03:58,209 --> 01:03:59,710
-Total jungle!
-[Ji-yeon] Having fun?

1634
01:03:59,794 --> 01:04:01,295
-[Jae-yun] Yes.
-[Ji-yeon giggles]

1635
01:04:01,379 --> 01:04:02,421
I'm…

1636
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:04,757
-a little scared.
-What?

1637
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:06,634
-It's kinda scary.
-What did you say?

1638
01:04:07,301 --> 01:04:08,636
-I think…
-Yeah?

1639
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:10,972
-I'm getting used to it.
-Really?

1640
01:04:11,055 --> 01:04:12,807
-[Eun-ji] What?
-[Car] What is he saying?

1641
01:04:12,890 --> 01:04:15,268
He just kept saying, "I'm scared."

1642
01:04:15,351 --> 01:04:18,437
And when she asked him, he said,
"I think I've gotten used to it."

1643
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:21,023
[Ji-yeon] Wasn't that
the most fun part of the trail?

1644
01:04:21,107 --> 01:04:22,191
[Jae-yun yelps]

1645
01:04:22,275 --> 01:04:23,901
[Ji-yeon giggles]

1646
01:04:23,985 --> 01:04:25,319
[amusing music playing]

1647
01:04:25,403 --> 01:04:27,530
[Ji-yeon] I can tell
you're starting to enjoy this.

1648
01:04:27,613 --> 01:04:29,365
No, I…

1649
01:04:30,908 --> 01:04:32,702
Are you gonna get your license now?

1650
01:04:35,746 --> 01:04:36,789
[Ji-yeon laughs]

1651
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:38,499
[all laughing]

1652
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:39,667
[Han-na] Jae-yun.

1653
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:41,752
I think he might die riding that thing.

1654
01:04:42,253 --> 01:04:44,088
[Han-na] Oh, no. I feel bad for him.

1655
01:04:44,922 --> 01:04:47,008
-[Jae-yun groans]
-[Cupids laughing]

1656
01:04:48,467 --> 01:04:50,845
[Jae-yun] Because ATVs require

1657
01:04:50,928 --> 01:04:53,431
my full undivided attention,

1658
01:04:53,514 --> 01:04:55,182
similar to riding motorcycles.

1659
01:04:55,266 --> 01:04:59,020
I was so focused
on being as safe as possible.

1660
01:04:59,103 --> 01:05:00,730
I couldn't enjoy it. I was stressed.

1661
01:05:00,813 --> 01:05:02,023
GARDEN CAFE

1662
01:05:02,106 --> 01:05:04,817
[Jae-yun] It seems like most cafes
out here have gardens.

1663
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:07,862
Yeah, I think you might be right.
Jeju is so nice.

1664
01:05:07,945 --> 01:05:10,406
[Jae-yun] I feel like there'll be
a gardener working here.

1665
01:05:10,489 --> 01:05:11,741
[Ji-yeon] I know, right?

1666
01:05:12,825 --> 01:05:13,868
How was today?

1667
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:16,746
You were good at driving,
for your first time.

1668
01:05:16,829 --> 01:05:19,457
I think that
even an elementary schooler could learn.

1669
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:20,458
Oh, really?

1670
01:05:20,541 --> 01:05:23,210
Could I do it too?
I think I'd cause an accident.

1671
01:05:23,294 --> 01:05:24,921
[Ji-yeon laughs]

1672
01:05:28,299 --> 01:05:31,552
So, not sure if you noticed, but…

1673
01:05:31,636 --> 01:05:34,931
we've gone on dates
for three days in a row now.

1674
01:05:35,014 --> 01:05:37,099
-You're right. [splutters] Three days.
-Right?

1675
01:05:37,183 --> 01:05:38,976
Is there anybody else
you're interested in?

1676
01:05:42,521 --> 01:05:43,689
Well… [coughs]

1677
01:05:44,315 --> 01:05:45,274
[sniffles]

1678
01:05:45,358 --> 01:05:46,233
Oh, so that…

1679
01:05:46,776 --> 01:05:47,944
-Well…
-Yes?

1680
01:05:49,111 --> 01:05:50,237
[chuckles]

1681
01:05:50,905 --> 01:05:52,907
[gloomy music playing]

1682
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:02,917
-No, no, no.
-It's fine. It's fine.

1683
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:03,960
It's so…

1684
01:06:04,752 --> 01:06:05,628
it's pretty here…

1685
01:06:05,711 --> 01:06:08,089
-You were saying? What?
-Later… let's take a picture here.

1686
01:06:08,172 --> 01:06:09,382
-Okay.
-Just saying.

1687
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:20,893
So, earlier, I…

1688
01:06:21,852 --> 01:06:23,062
So… [sighs]

1689
01:06:23,145 --> 01:06:25,898
When you were choosing your date, I felt…

1690
01:06:26,857 --> 01:06:29,318
I felt a bit… embarrassed

1691
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:32,947
because of how you acted
in front of everyone. Yeah.

1692
01:06:33,030 --> 01:06:35,157
-[Jae-yun] Right.
-I was so embarrassed.

1693
01:06:37,326 --> 01:06:38,327
And I thought,

1694
01:06:39,537 --> 01:06:41,122
maybe you'd bring it up first

1695
01:06:42,289 --> 01:06:44,375
at some point during our date.

1696
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:49,213
-[Jae-yun] Oh, I… I should've apologized…
-You don't have to. I just…

1697
01:06:51,382 --> 01:06:55,344
I was just really…
I was just spacing out. I couldn't focus.

1698
01:07:00,391 --> 01:07:01,934
It was hurtful. [chuckles]

1699
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:03,769
[Jae-yun] Oh…

1700
01:07:05,563 --> 01:07:07,064
-Sorry.
-Don't worry.

1701
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:08,399
[music fades]

1702
01:07:08,983 --> 01:07:11,193
Is it hard to talk about things like this?

1703
01:07:11,277 --> 01:07:12,111
[chuckles]

1704
01:07:12,194 --> 01:07:15,573
No? But it seems
so tough for you. [chuckles]

1705
01:07:15,656 --> 01:07:16,615
I actually…

1706
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:20,536
Clearing up… I mean, like…

1707
01:07:20,619 --> 01:07:25,207
I think you'd feel better if…
if we talked it out. [clears throat]

1708
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:26,542
Who? Me?

1709
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:29,003
Actually, me.

1710
01:07:30,171 --> 01:07:31,213
Me too.

1711
01:07:32,757 --> 01:07:35,217
I see. Let's… Let's talk after we eat.

1712
01:07:36,927 --> 01:07:37,803
It can wait.

1713
01:07:42,683 --> 01:07:45,436
I think telling me everything
you're upset about

1714
01:07:46,062 --> 01:07:48,230
would help me… reflect

1715
01:07:48,314 --> 01:07:51,484
and maybe fix things… somehow.

1716
01:07:52,735 --> 01:07:54,612
And learn to do better.

1717
01:07:55,571 --> 01:07:57,406
I'm not trying to scold you. [chuckles]

1718
01:07:57,490 --> 01:07:59,742
Oh, I know that. I really do, it's just…

1719
01:08:00,951 --> 01:08:03,788
I'm just… trying to be honest with you.

1720
01:08:03,871 --> 01:08:04,872
[exhales]

1721
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:07,458
[contemplative music playing]

1722
01:08:09,794 --> 01:08:13,047
[Jae-yun] In retrospect,
I think I should've talked about

1723
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:14,715
the punching machine incident.

1724
01:08:14,799 --> 01:08:19,470
I felt bad that, I…
didn't try talking to Ji-yeon about it.

1725
01:08:19,553 --> 01:08:21,097
She's the one who…

1726
01:08:23,015 --> 01:08:24,141
brought it up first.

1727
01:08:25,893 --> 01:08:27,436
-[music fades]
-[bird caws]

1728
01:08:28,604 --> 01:08:30,815
[Ji-yeon] Do you have anything to ask me?

1729
01:08:30,898 --> 01:08:32,817
To ask you? I'm not sure.

1730
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:34,485
Yes. Anything.

1731
01:08:35,027 --> 01:08:36,028
Don't be shy.

1732
01:08:38,030 --> 01:08:39,240
-Today…
-Yeah.

1733
01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:41,992
-…for dinner…
-Hmm?

1734
01:08:45,913 --> 01:08:46,956
…what will you cook?

1735
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:49,083
For tonight's dinner?

1736
01:08:49,792 --> 01:08:50,626
Yeah.

1737
01:08:53,712 --> 01:08:54,922
[Ji-yeon] I'm not sure.

1738
01:08:55,005 --> 01:08:57,466
Is everyone eating out or…

1739
01:09:00,886 --> 01:09:03,347
Should I make some alcohol-braised clams?

1740
01:09:07,101 --> 01:09:08,018
[Jae-yun] Mmm…

1741
01:09:10,354 --> 01:09:11,397
[Jae-yun sniffles]

1742
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:12,398
Today…

1743
01:09:14,024 --> 01:09:15,568
[sniffles] for dinner…

1744
01:09:18,821 --> 01:09:20,906
weren't you going to cook beef belly?

1745
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:22,324
[splutters] Beef belly…

1746
01:09:22,408 --> 01:09:23,409
Beef belly?

1747
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:27,830
[somber music playing]

1748
01:09:27,913 --> 01:09:28,956
[Ji-yeon] It just…

1749
01:09:29,039 --> 01:09:30,332
made me mad.

1750
01:09:30,416 --> 01:09:31,417
How do I explain?

1751
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,002
What he wanted to ask me

1752
01:09:33,085 --> 01:09:35,838
wasn't, "What's your ideal type?"
or anything like that.

1753
01:09:35,921 --> 01:09:38,340
He wanted to know
what I was going to cook.

1754
01:09:38,424 --> 01:09:39,717
I'm not a chef.

1755
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:40,885
"What is this?"

1756
01:09:41,427 --> 01:09:43,053
"Am I the chef here?"

1757
01:09:43,137 --> 01:09:44,555
That's how I felt.

1758
01:09:44,638 --> 01:09:48,767
It wasn't a question of him
not trying hard enough.

1759
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:52,730
I was just really upset
with his behavior earlier that day.

1760
01:09:59,904 --> 01:10:02,698
[Jae-yun] She… seemed to be very angry.

1761
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:08,329
After I learned that she was
actually interested in me romantically,

1762
01:10:09,163 --> 01:10:09,997
I think…

1763
01:10:10,748 --> 01:10:12,833
I tried avoiding that talk

1764
01:10:12,917 --> 01:10:17,129
by saying things
that created distance between us.

1765
01:10:19,882 --> 01:10:20,841
Shall we go?

1766
01:10:21,342 --> 01:10:23,010
[somber music continues]

1767
01:10:32,144 --> 01:10:35,606
That's the first time we're seeing
Ji-yeon's face like that on this show.

1768
01:10:35,689 --> 01:10:36,899
Mmm.

1769
01:10:36,982 --> 01:10:38,108
When Ji-yeon found out

1770
01:10:38,192 --> 01:10:41,904
that Jae-yun was initially interested
in another one of the girls…

1771
01:10:41,987 --> 01:10:44,240
-[Han-na] Yeah.
-…she said she'd keep going for him.

1772
01:10:44,323 --> 01:10:46,909
-[Han-na] Right.
-But even after having this talk,

1773
01:10:46,992 --> 01:10:48,744
things aren't going too great for them.

1774
01:10:48,827 --> 01:10:51,330
From the date matching earlier
to the motorcycle ride,

1775
01:10:51,413 --> 01:10:53,040
and now, this cafe fiasco.

1776
01:10:53,123 --> 01:10:56,168
I'm starting to think that she
just might be the first one to give up.

1777
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:57,544
-[Car] It's tough.
-First of all,

1778
01:10:57,628 --> 01:11:00,422
-Jae-yun likes Yeo-myung.
-[Han-na] Right.

1779
01:11:00,506 --> 01:11:02,591
Remember all the things
he did to impress her?

1780
01:11:02,675 --> 01:11:04,301
-Yes, of course.
-He put on cologne…

1781
01:11:04,385 --> 01:11:05,219
Yeah.

1782
01:11:05,302 --> 01:11:07,054
And the fastest
he's ever moved on this show

1783
01:11:07,137 --> 01:11:09,265
was when he was
writing down notes from her diary.

1784
01:11:09,348 --> 01:11:10,474
-The 5 Minute Library.
-Yeah.

1785
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:14,728
Since he's definitely interested in her,
I think it's starting to show

1786
01:11:14,812 --> 01:11:18,649
that he is clearly not that into Ji-yeon
and nor will he be in the future.

1787
01:11:18,732 --> 01:11:20,985
Do you guys think
Ji-yeon will give up on him?

1788
01:11:21,819 --> 01:11:22,653
[sighs]

1789
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:27,366
[Ji-yeon sighs]

1790
01:11:29,618 --> 01:11:30,869
-[car door closes]
-[Ji-yeon] I…

1791
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:32,913
[Seung-chan] I'll change,
see you in the Lounge

1792
01:11:32,997 --> 01:11:34,748
[Min-hong] I'm gonna
change into loungewear.

1793
01:11:36,250 --> 01:11:37,293
How was today?

1794
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:40,170
[Jae-yun] I think… [sniffles]

1795
01:11:40,254 --> 01:11:42,506
-I really… [chuckles] really.
-Hmm?

1796
01:11:45,175 --> 01:11:46,593
I… really…

1797
01:11:46,677 --> 01:11:48,470
-You really…
-…screwed things up.

1798
01:11:48,554 --> 01:11:49,388
Why?

1799
01:11:54,059 --> 01:11:55,269
Why? Tell me why.

1800
01:11:55,352 --> 01:11:56,645
-[Jae-yun] It's nothing.
-Why?

1801
01:11:57,813 --> 01:11:59,857
-I'll just tell you later.
-Mmm. If you say so.

1802
01:11:59,940 --> 01:12:01,400
-See you later.
-Going to the Lounge?

1803
01:12:01,483 --> 01:12:03,902
[Min-hong] Yeah. But first,
I need to wash off all this dirt.

1804
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:05,487
-Okay.
-I'll see you in a bit.

1805
01:12:10,617 --> 01:12:12,328
[door lock beeping]

1806
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:17,958
[sniffles, exhales]

1807
01:12:18,584 --> 01:12:20,044
[breath trembling]

1808
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:23,714
[crying quietly]

1809
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:34,224
[gentle melancholic music playing]

1810
01:12:35,309 --> 01:12:36,769
[Jae-yun] So, I…

1811
01:12:38,896 --> 01:12:39,730
kept…

1812
01:12:42,608 --> 01:12:46,278
I kept feeling… terrible
about the last few days.

1813
01:12:46,862 --> 01:12:49,490
I felt uncomfortable being direct.

1814
01:12:50,074 --> 01:12:53,035
I felt more comfortable being indirect.

1815
01:12:53,702 --> 01:12:56,330
I incorrectly assumed it would…

1816
01:12:57,039 --> 01:13:00,459
cause her less pain
if I acted indifferent with her.

1817
01:13:01,168 --> 01:13:04,129
I felt so embarrassed… and ashamed

1818
01:13:04,797 --> 01:13:06,256
of how I treated…

1819
01:13:06,965 --> 01:13:08,634
Ji-yeon this whole time.

1820
01:13:09,218 --> 01:13:10,761
I couldn't help but cry.

1821
01:13:10,844 --> 01:13:14,056
-[gentle melancholic music continues]
-[continues crying quietly]

1822
01:13:21,105 --> 01:13:22,314
[exhaling heavily]

1823
01:13:33,283 --> 01:13:34,201
[insects trilling]

1824
01:13:34,284 --> 01:13:35,244
[Jae-yun] Min-hong!

1825
01:13:42,584 --> 01:13:46,588
-Do you need to wear sunglasses?
-Oh, I… I've got an upset stomach. Yeah.

1826
01:13:46,672 --> 01:13:48,006
-You eating?
-Oh.

1827
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:49,299
-I, um…
-Oh, aren't you hungry?

1828
01:13:49,383 --> 01:13:50,509
…ate a lot of cake earlier.

1829
01:13:50,592 --> 01:13:52,219
That's not enough food.

1830
01:13:53,137 --> 01:13:54,263
Well, do as you like.

1831
01:13:57,266 --> 01:13:59,059
[gentle melancholic music playing]

1832
01:13:59,143 --> 01:14:01,019
[sighs heavily, sniffles]

1833
01:14:02,855 --> 01:14:06,900
[Jae-yun] I couldn't stop crying,
so I lied about having an upset stomach.

1834
01:14:07,526 --> 01:14:09,361
Wait. He really can't come at all?

1835
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:12,573
I gave him a little something to eat.

1836
01:14:14,867 --> 01:14:16,243
[Seung-chan] What happened?

1837
01:14:19,329 --> 01:14:20,330
[clears throat]

1838
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:25,669
[sighs]

1839
01:14:27,963 --> 01:14:29,173
[cries softly]

1840
01:14:29,256 --> 01:14:30,340
[music subsides]

1841
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:35,929
-[gentle melancholic music resumes]
-[water running]

1842
01:14:36,013 --> 01:14:37,931
[continues crying softly]

1843
01:14:41,685 --> 01:14:43,061
[sobbing]

1844
01:14:57,910 --> 01:14:58,911
[sighs]

1845
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:00,537
[music fades]

1846
01:15:00,621 --> 01:15:01,997
Oh, Jae-yun.

1847
01:15:02,581 --> 01:15:04,541
-[Car] He's really struggling, huh?
-Mmm.

1848
01:15:04,625 --> 01:15:06,793
I feel… I feel so bad for him.

1849
01:15:06,877 --> 01:15:09,254
People don't usually cry
or have this reaction

1850
01:15:09,338 --> 01:15:11,465
when they don't actually have
feelings for someone.

1851
01:15:11,548 --> 01:15:12,591
[Eun-ji and In-guk] Right.

1852
01:15:12,674 --> 01:15:14,635
People who are bad
at expressing themselves

1853
01:15:14,718 --> 01:15:16,094
and don't speak much

1854
01:15:16,178 --> 01:15:18,263
generally care a lot
about how others feel.

1855
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:19,181
[Car] Yeah.

1856
01:15:19,264 --> 01:15:21,683
They try their hardest
not to be a burden for other people

1857
01:15:21,767 --> 01:15:24,520
and they despise the idea
of being responsible for hurting someone.

1858
01:15:24,603 --> 01:15:25,479
They're considerate.

1859
01:15:25,562 --> 01:15:28,690
I think he didn't really know
how to respond, so he just said, "No."

1860
01:15:28,774 --> 01:15:30,901
But he was too harsh

1861
01:15:30,984 --> 01:15:33,862
and that resulted
in the other person getting really upset

1862
01:15:33,946 --> 01:15:35,197
and taking it out on him.

1863
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:36,406
Exactly.

1864
01:15:36,490 --> 01:15:38,033
"I did something wrong again."

1865
01:15:38,116 --> 01:15:39,201
"I made her mad."

1866
01:15:39,284 --> 01:15:40,536
"Oh, I feel so terrible."

1867
01:15:40,619 --> 01:15:43,705
I think all of these things
were too heavy and brought him to tears.

1868
01:15:43,789 --> 01:15:46,250
Let's not forget that
Jae-yun wasn't the only hurt one.

1869
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:47,751
Ji-yeon was hurting too.

1870
01:15:47,834 --> 01:15:49,878
-Hmm.
-Jae-yun has also been through a lot.

1871
01:15:49,962 --> 01:15:51,046
-[Han-na] Mmm.
-Right.

1872
01:15:51,129 --> 01:15:54,174
And since they're all experiencing this
for the very first time,

1873
01:15:54,258 --> 01:15:56,927
it must be even more difficult
to navigate all these emotions.

1874
01:15:57,844 --> 01:15:58,845
[sighs]

1875
01:15:59,638 --> 01:16:01,223
-[Do] Good job.
-[Hyun-kyu] You too.

1876
01:16:01,306 --> 01:16:03,141
-[Yeo-myung] Good job.
-[Jeong-mok] Thank you.

1877
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:05,602
See you in a bit.

1878
01:16:07,771 --> 01:16:08,939
[door lock beeps]

1879
01:16:09,815 --> 01:16:11,275
-[Jae-yun coughs]
-[Jeong-mok] Huh?

1880
01:16:11,984 --> 01:16:13,819
What? You're asleep?

1881
01:16:16,363 --> 01:16:17,573
[Jae-yun exhales]

1882
01:16:17,656 --> 01:16:19,283
[Jae-yun, groggily] Oh, you're back.

1883
01:16:20,450 --> 01:16:22,286
-[Jeong-mok] You okay?
-[Jae-yun] Yes.

1884
01:16:22,369 --> 01:16:25,497
-I mean, I have something to tell you.
-[Jeong-mok] All right. Me?

1885
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:26,999
-[Jae-yun] Yeah.
-[Jeong-mok] Why?

1886
01:16:27,082 --> 01:16:29,334
[Jae-yun] Thanks for
letting me wear your sunglasses.

1887
01:16:29,418 --> 01:16:31,003
-You did wear them?
-Yeah.

1888
01:16:31,086 --> 01:16:34,506
They came in handy
when we were ridding the ATVs.

1889
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:35,632
[Jeong-mok] Mmm.

1890
01:16:35,716 --> 01:16:38,218
So much mud got into my eyes.

1891
01:16:39,219 --> 01:16:40,679
[Jeong-mok] That's good.

1892
01:16:40,762 --> 01:16:43,056
-Yeah.
-And they look pretty good on you.

1893
01:16:45,350 --> 01:16:48,270
-Could I… borrow them for today?
-Of course.

1894
01:16:48,353 --> 01:16:50,230
-Oh, thanks. Well… I just…
-Why?

1895
01:16:51,356 --> 01:16:53,609
-They look cool.
-[chuckles] Okay.

1896
01:16:53,692 --> 01:16:54,735
[Jae-yun sniffles]

1897
01:16:55,986 --> 01:16:57,321
[Jeong-mok] How did things feel?

1898
01:16:58,530 --> 01:16:59,573
[Jae-yun] Well…

1899
01:17:00,157 --> 01:17:02,034
-this morning…
-Oh, when you picked the girl?

1900
01:17:02,784 --> 01:17:04,745
-Yeah, I should've…
-Yeah.

1901
01:17:04,828 --> 01:17:07,414
I should've… apologized about that,

1902
01:17:07,497 --> 01:17:10,334
but I… kept pretending things were fine.

1903
01:17:10,834 --> 01:17:11,835
And they weren't.

1904
01:17:13,378 --> 01:17:14,379
She told me…

1905
01:17:15,422 --> 01:17:16,465
Was she hurt?

1906
01:17:17,633 --> 01:17:19,384
-Kind of, yeah.
-Huh, really?

1907
01:17:19,926 --> 01:17:22,512
-Yeah, I think after dinner, I'm going to…
-Yeah?

1908
01:17:23,347 --> 01:17:25,557
-I'm gonna talk to her some more.
-Hmm.

1909
01:17:25,641 --> 01:17:28,769
KANG JI-SU
KIM YEO-MYUNG

1910
01:17:31,813 --> 01:17:32,648
[switch clicks]

1911
01:17:35,651 --> 01:17:36,943
Ugh, I need a shower.

1912
01:17:37,027 --> 01:17:39,029
[mellow music playing]

1913
01:17:39,696 --> 01:17:41,865
I put a letter in his mailbox yesterday

1914
01:17:41,948 --> 01:17:45,035
and I've been dying to go up to him
and talk about it,

1915
01:17:45,118 --> 01:17:46,662
but I haven't been able to.

1916
01:17:47,537 --> 01:17:49,956
I really wanted to
talk to him about the letter,

1917
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:52,292
but I couldn't work up the courage.

1918
01:17:52,376 --> 01:17:54,628
I missed my opportunity this evening.

1919
01:17:56,254 --> 01:17:58,382
When will I get to talk to him by myself?

1920
01:17:58,882 --> 01:18:01,968
I think I should ask him out on a date.

1921
01:18:03,387 --> 01:18:06,598
A FEW HOURS LATER

1922
01:18:12,062 --> 01:18:13,772
[Jeong-mok] Did you enjoy the ATVs?

1923
01:18:13,855 --> 01:18:15,107
[Ji-yeon] They were so fun.

1924
01:18:16,233 --> 01:18:17,734
[Yeo-myung] Hey, can I talk to him?

1925
01:18:18,735 --> 01:18:20,320
-[Do] Sure.
-[Jeong-mok] Sure, let's go.

1926
01:18:20,404 --> 01:18:23,573
-[Yeo-myung] Why? Where should we go talk?
-[Jeong-mok] What? Let's go up there.

1927
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:29,079
So, were… you peeking
during the claw machine yesterday?

1928
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:31,832
-No, right? Kept your eyes closed?
-I found out later.

1929
01:18:31,915 --> 01:18:33,166
-You found out later?
-Yeah.

1930
01:18:33,250 --> 01:18:35,293
-Mmm.
-I was actually going to pick you.

1931
01:18:35,377 --> 01:18:37,879
-But you failed?
-Mm-hmm. Epically.

1932
01:18:37,963 --> 01:18:39,256
[chuckles]

1933
01:18:40,674 --> 01:18:42,134
Would you be interested…

1934
01:18:43,135 --> 01:18:45,345
in going on a date with me? [sniffles]

1935
01:18:49,766 --> 01:18:50,809
"Interested."

1936
01:18:50,892 --> 01:18:53,270
-I want to get to know everyone.
-Right.

1937
01:18:54,688 --> 01:18:56,398
I… I do.

1938
01:18:56,481 --> 01:18:58,692
-[Yeo-myung chuckles]
-I really do, but…

1939
01:19:02,696 --> 01:19:04,448
-So, from everyone here…
-Hmm?

1940
01:19:06,616 --> 01:19:07,951
-I mean…
-Mmm?

1941
01:19:10,495 --> 01:19:11,371
I…

1942
01:19:12,414 --> 01:19:14,166
I was most attracted to you.

1943
01:19:14,249 --> 01:19:15,500
[gentle music playing]

1944
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:16,793
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1945
01:19:16,877 --> 01:19:19,921
I mean, we've never actually
had the chance

1946
01:19:20,005 --> 01:19:21,631
to go on a one-on-one date.

1947
01:19:22,591 --> 01:19:25,635
And, well,
we haven't really talked that much.

1948
01:19:26,303 --> 01:19:27,763
And despite that,

1949
01:19:29,014 --> 01:19:30,474
I've become… [giggling]

1950
01:19:33,602 --> 01:19:34,978
Um, how do I say this?

1951
01:19:35,061 --> 01:19:39,649
I'm still very interested in… you.

1952
01:19:39,733 --> 01:19:41,735
[enchanting music playing]

1953
01:19:41,818 --> 01:19:43,653
-[chuckles]
-This… This is…

1954
01:19:44,821 --> 01:19:47,532
-Don't you think the others…
-Yeah?

1955
01:19:47,616 --> 01:19:50,118
You don't feel that way
about the others? Huh?

1956
01:19:54,581 --> 01:19:56,249
You're it… for me.

1957
01:19:57,751 --> 01:19:59,753
[upbeat enchanting music playing]

1958
01:20:14,142 --> 01:20:15,268
[music subsides]
