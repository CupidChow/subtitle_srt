1
00:00:06,965 --> 00:00:09,134
It's here, the final episode.

2
00:00:09,217 --> 00:00:10,176
-Wow.
-Already?

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,220
-Didn't the time just fly by?
-[Eun-ji] Seriously.

4
00:00:12,303 --> 00:00:15,140
-Time flies when you're having fun.
-Hey, but up until the end,

5
00:00:15,223 --> 00:00:16,891
with Ji-su and that whole thing…

6
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:19,561
-What'll we do about Seung-li and Ji-su?
-[Eun-ji] Why, God?

7
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:22,188
I was sure that we'd have two couples
by the end of the show,

8
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,482
-but I don't know anymore.
-Right, right.

9
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:27,485
If you think about it,
there's really one day left

10
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:28,987
-until final choice.
-[Eun-ji] Yeah.

11
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,698
I'm worried about what'll happen
with Ji-su and Seung-li,

12
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:33,491
because Seung-li didn't remember

13
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:36,286
-that really intense story Ji-su told him.
-Right. Exactly.

14
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:39,039
I'm worried that incident
will have a big impact on Ji-su

15
00:00:39,122 --> 00:00:41,166
and things will get all shaken up again.

16
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:43,835
[enchanting music playing]

17
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,590
[birds chirping]

18
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:06,775
-[In-guk] Why am I only seeing one person?
-[Han-na] What? They slept separately?

19
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,110
[Ji-yeon] Are you awake?

20
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:11,279
-They're in the same bed!
-What? Hey!

21
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:12,864
[Car] What is this? What's going on?

22
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:15,742
-Wait, they were on top of each other?
-[Car] God, I can't believe it.

23
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:17,744
[Han-na] What?
I thought that was one person.

24
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:19,537
[pleasant music playing]

25
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:20,955
[Ji-yeon] Are you awake?

26
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:22,999
[Eun-ji] Oh, my gosh,
oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh!

27
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,584
Let's get up now. Sit up.

28
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:26,586
DID ANYTHING HAPPEN LAST NIGHT
BETWEEN YOU TWO?

29
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:28,088
That looks pretty.

30
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:30,256
That's a secret.

31
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,509
I'll let you imagine.

32
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,765
[Jeong-mok] I hope we all
have dinner together tonight.

33
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:40,016
[Ji-yeon] Totally.

34
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:42,560
I think it'd be nice
to cook for ourselves,

35
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:44,395
since it's the last dinner.

36
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,314
Like when we opened up the tent bar.

37
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:49,567
That was delicious.

38
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:50,860
-Really?
-Yeah.

39
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:54,030
-Thanks. I'll make you tons of great food.
-[Han-na gasps] What?!

40
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:54,989
[Ji-yeon] Mmm.

41
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,367
-[Jeong-mok] I can't wait.
-Okay.

42
00:01:58,034 --> 00:02:01,121
That was nothing
compared to some of the stuff I can make.

43
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:02,372
-[Jeong-mok] Really?
-Yeah.

44
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,666
[Car] Things really progressed.

45
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,378
[Ji-yeon] Oh, right.
We haven't written in the guest log.

46
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:09,546
[music fades]

47
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:11,506
-[Jeong-mok] Oh, the guest log. Right.
-Yeah.

48
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:13,550
What should I write?

49
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:17,011
[mellow guitar music playing]

50
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,266
Whatever you want.

51
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,768
-[Cupids gasp]
-[In-guk] What?

52
00:02:23,852 --> 00:02:26,437
-[Han-na] They're so sweet to each other.
-[Eun-ji] What is this?

53
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:36,156
Wait, you're…

54
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,116
you're writing
almost the same thing as me.

55
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,159
-Really?
-Yeah.

56
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:40,660
No way!

57
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:43,705
I LOVE YOU, JEONG-MOK
LET'S COME BACK HERE AGAIN

58
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:45,665
[Han-na] Oh, "I love you, Jeong-mok."

59
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:47,917
[Car] Whoa, "I love you"? That was fast.

60
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,919
[Ji-yeon] Wanna check out
the back before we go?

61
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,171
[Jeong-mok] Yeah, let's go!

62
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,256
[pleasant guitar music playing]

63
00:02:57,552 --> 00:03:00,263
[Jeong-mok] We were sitting
on the swing in the backyard.

64
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:03,850
The view was so pretty,
the weather was great.

65
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:05,727
It was such a memorable moment.

66
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:11,149
My heart felt so full
after our overnight date.

67
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:14,402
We had a little barbecue…

68
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:15,820
[inaudible]

69
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:18,990
…we sat by the fire,

70
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:21,409
and I got to know her better.

71
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:24,120
It was really nice.

72
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:27,540
I felt more and more sure of my feelings.

73
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:29,584
She's the one.

74
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:31,586
She's the one.

75
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:36,382
I feel like I can experience
new things with Jeong-mok.

76
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:39,802
And that makes me really happy.

77
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:45,683
I keep thinking to myself,
"How did I end up liking someone so much?"

78
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,268
[inaudible]

79
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,603
I'm really surprised.

80
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:50,897
[music ends]

81
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:54,984
Like, I think these two could start
looking for wedding venues right now.

82
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:58,154
-Seriously. We should be the MCs. Yeah.
-[In-guk] Oh, I like that.

83
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,948
I'll sing "My Baby U" for them.

84
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,532
-Do the dance too though.
-Of course.

85
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,743
-You can't forget the dance.
-Obviously.

86
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,748
[Min-hong] I mean… God, how do I put it?

87
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:11,334
I honestly thought

88
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:15,880
he was gonna ask me and Do
for, like, five minutes each,

89
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,006
and then…

90
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,299
[pensive music playing]

91
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,093
Did you think he'd tell you?

92
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:21,678
I thought he'd tell us, yeah.

93
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:22,595
He didn't?

94
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,056
-I guess he didn't. We were together.
-He didn't.

95
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:26,849
We were in that Lounge together.

96
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:27,976
So I just…

97
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:30,270
I mean, I'm just annoyed with him.

98
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:33,564
Seriously. You told him
you were waiting for an answer,

99
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:35,483
but he just went off to have fun.

100
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:38,653
Yeah, I mean, he felt bad,
so he didn't wanna tell me.

101
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:41,197
He kept avoiding me and then just left.

102
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,699
I feel like, ugh…

103
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:45,910
-He's being such a pathetic loser.
-Yeah.

104
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:49,289
I mean, yeah, such a loser.

105
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:51,207
Is it so hard to spit it out?

106
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:55,670
I get that it's hard, I know it is,
but… just do it, you know?

107
00:04:55,753 --> 00:04:58,423
At this rate, he'll talk to you
five minutes before final choice.

108
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:01,551
If he does at all.

109
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,803
Will you talk to Jeong-mok once he's back?

110
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,515
I wanna wait and see.

111
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:09,434
-If he asks you to talk?
-Yeah.

112
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:13,438
-Exactly, he might not even say anything.
-Seriously, it isn't right. It's not okay.

113
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:15,773

[breezy music playing]

115
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:20,069
-[Ji-yeon] I don't wanna go back.
-[Jeong-mok] Me neither.

116
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:22,280
I don't want to leave.

117
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:23,948
Why can't we stay here?

118
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:26,659
I refuse to go.

119
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,911
[Han-na] These two
are so in their own world.

120
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:29,954
This trip…

121
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,541
it was one of the happiest days

122
00:05:34,542 --> 00:05:35,835
in my whole life.

123
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,171
-[turn signal clicking]
-Agreed.

124
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:41,883
It was a happy excursion.
I had so much fun.

125
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,845
[Ji-yeon] Guys, we're back.

126
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:48,389
Oh, don't do that. Don't do that.

127
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,433
-Don't gloat about it.
-[Han-na] Don't rub it in.

128
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,602
-Please, guys, hide how happy you are.
-[Car] Yeah.

129
00:05:58,524 --> 00:05:59,400

[continues crying]

132
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:17,794
[Do] I cried…

133
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:20,254
[gentle poignant music playing]

134
00:06:21,631 --> 00:06:23,800
Why am I crying right now?

135
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,761
Am I sad about this?

136
00:06:33,476 --> 00:06:37,271
Wow, I must've liked him
more than I'd realized.

137
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:40,858
[continues crying]

138
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:43,361
[sighing wistfully]

139
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:51,702
[Ji-yeon] Newsletter?

140
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,622
[Hyun-kyu] This could be
the last newsletter, right?

141
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:56,457
Oh, wait, what does it say?

142
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,000
What?

143
00:06:58,543 --> 00:06:59,377
What is this?

144
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,461
[upbeat music playing]

145
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:02,088
It's a "let-it-out date."

146
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:03,756
A let-it-out date?

147
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,843
[Yeo-myung] "If you have something
you feel the need to express,

148
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:11,180
lingering feelings or any last words,
please sign up via text."

149
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,767
Oh, because it's the last day?
Yeah, they should say what they wanna say.

150
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,310
-They should.
-It's the perfect time.

151
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:17,812
-Hmm.
-[Han-na] Their last chance.

152
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:19,522
Maybe I should…

153
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:21,899
Oh, you should, you should.

154
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,528
Do we just have to send a text?

155
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:26,654
[wistful music playing]

156
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:28,698
[Min-hong] I requested
to talk to Jeong-mok

157
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,992
because I think we need closure.

158
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,079
The feelings I've felt
while I've been here,

159
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,290
especially the bad ones,

160
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:39,417
I want to leave them in Jeju.

161
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,711
In this room, before I leave.

162
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:45,882
I think this experience
was almost like a dream.

163
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:47,717
Just a dream.

164
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,927
I think I signed up so I could do it

165
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:52,346
and then just leave it
behind me and move on.

166
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:55,391
[wistful music continues]

167
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,854
-[Jeong-mok] Min-hong came to mind.
-[Han-na] Oh, Jeong-mok too?

168
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:03,274
Well, with Min-hong it didn't really…

169
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:07,445
It doesn't feel like we had any closure.

170
00:08:07,528 --> 00:08:09,489
That thought kept nagging at me.

171
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:10,781
I thought,

172
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:13,868
"I should have a final talk
with Min-hong today."

173
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:16,412
[Han-na] Oh, Jeong-mok
was worried about it too.

174
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,497
[inhales]

175
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,706
[sighs deeply]

176
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:21,250
-[In-guk] Oh, no, our dear sweet Do.
-[Han-na] What'll she do?

177
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,502
[Do] "Let-it-out date."

178
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:24,253
"Let…"

179
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:27,340
[Do] At first, I wasn't gonna do it.

180
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:31,302
But then, I realized that
I only want to see Jeong-mok

181
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:33,387
while I'm here in Jeju.

182
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:36,432
It'll be too hard
to see him again in Seoul.

183
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,770
So I signed up and thought to myself,

184
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:44,065
"Let's have one last
one-on-one date together."

185
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:47,443
[Han-na] Oh, she still did it.
She's gonna talk to him.

186
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,444
You signed up?

187
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,279
I haven't yet, no.

188
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,656
-[Hyun-kyu] You should.
-Did you?

189
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:53,157
-Hey, sign up.
-[Seung-li] Okay.

190
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,909
-Who'll you ask for?
-[Sang-ho] We should.

191
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:55,910
Sign up. Sign up.

192
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,037
[Hyun-kyu] "Should I do this or not?"

193
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,206
I kept thinking it over, but then I saw

194
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:02,416
that my fingers
had already typed out the text.

195
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,503
So, like, because it's our last chance…

196
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:06,629
[solemn music playing]

197
00:09:06,712 --> 00:09:10,883
I knew it wouldn't happen, but I just…
I just wanted to hold onto something.

198
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:14,262
If I'm not her type, then that's fine,

199
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:17,557
but maybe she still feels
some sort of affection for me,

200
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:19,684
just not the way I do for her.

201
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:21,727
SEUNG-LI, JI-SU

202
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,813
[Seung-li] I asked to talk to Ji-su.

203
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:27,692
I thought a one-on-one chat
might help clear things up between us.

204
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:31,696
So, yesterday,
we were talking on the terrace.

205
00:09:32,655 --> 00:09:35,741
But he didn't remember
what we talked about on our date.

206
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,118
I got so pissed off.

207
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,621
[Seung-li] What did you say…

208
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,165
What did you talk about
in your pre-interview?

209
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,127
Are you serious?

210
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,044
You forgot.

211
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:49,088
Ji-su, come on. I don't want to mess up.

212
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:50,923
[Han-na] That wasn't
a casual conversation.

213
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:53,551
[Eun-ji] It was a really serious,
deep discussion.

214
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:55,136
-What?
-[Min-hong] Oh, I'm not sure.

215
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,347
I can't sign up for this
and then go and be like,

216
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:01,017
"I'm so pissed you got drunk
and didn't remember anything."

217
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,687
Yeah, in the middle of a nice cafe date.
But, Seung-li…

218
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,106
I mean…

219
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:09,817
He could've responded that way

220
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,278
because he just panicked.

221
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:14,947
I just need to say these things
to let my anger out.

222
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,575
[chuckles]

223
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,535
It seems like she wants to tell him off.

224
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,371
-Oof, how are they gonna resolve this?
-[Han-na] Oh, my gosh.

225
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,457
-[serene music playing]
-[birds chirping]

226
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:34,425
[camera shutter clicks]

227
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:35,635
How pretty.

228
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:47,271
-[Han-na] Hyun-kyu!
-[Eun-ji] It's Hyun-kyu.

229
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:55,029
[chuckles softly]

230
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,076
[chuckles] Oh.

231
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,204
I made you wait in the heat.

232
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:06,248
Don't I always make you wait?

233
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,376
Not at all.

234
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:10,252
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

235
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:11,962
I am. Of course.

236
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,465
Are you surprised?

237
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,842
No, 'cause I asked for you.

238
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,636
-[chuckles] Oh, really?
-Yeah.

239
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:21,097
[Han-na] Ji-su asked for Hyun-kyu too.

240
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,765
[Eun-ji] They chose each other.

241
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:27,061
You gotta show her your sweet
and sensitive side, Hyun-kyu.

242
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:28,687
[music fades]

243
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,189
How are you?

244
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:32,942
We've been together this whole time,
but we haven't really talked.

245
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,902
Right. I've been fine.

246
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:36,362
Good.

247
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:38,072
How have these last days been for you?

248
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:41,075
-I've just been thinking a lot.
-Hmm.

249
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:43,452
I read the letter you sent me.

250
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,662
You read it?

251
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:47,498
Yeah.

252
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:50,334
I'm so relieved to hear that.

253
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:51,752
-Really?
-Yeah.

254
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:55,089
Yeah.

255
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:57,425
"I don't want to say
something wrong here."

256
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,718
"But you know who I am now."

257
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:03,305
"I might seem a little robotic and stiff."

258
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,308
"Like someone
who only cares about efficiency."

259
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:09,520
-Oh, did you write something for this?
-I didn't wanna make mistakes,

260
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:12,189
-so I planned this out.
-[Han-na] He wrote things on his phone.

261
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,984
But this is a very peaceful space.

262
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:17,528
There are all these people taking walks,

263
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:19,697
-the weather is so beautiful today.
-Yeah.

264
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:22,158
So let's only say good things.

265
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,826
-Only good things?
-Yeah.

266
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,828
[amusing music playing]

267
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:28,164
-[chuckles] What's wrong?
-No, that's fine. You're right.

268
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,874
-You look so sad.
-You're right.

269
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:33,085
-Let's skip this thing I wrote.
-Yeah.

270
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:34,295
-We can skip it?
-Yeah.

271
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:39,091
Just tell me. Did I do something wrong?

272
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:40,676
No.

273
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:42,511
Then it's okay.

274
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,263
-It's fine.
-Yeah.

275
00:12:45,973 --> 00:12:47,516
I do regret something.

276
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,144
You said it sometimes
seemed like we were the same age,

277
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:51,395
-but then other times…
-Yeah.

278
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:53,814
-…it seemed like I was younger.
-Mmm.

279
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:56,150
And that sometimes
you felt like you were my age,

280
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:57,693
but sometimes you felt older.

281
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,821
But I never made you feel like
I was the older one

282
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:03,657
and you were the younger one.

283
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:06,327
I regret not doing that.

284
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:11,123
Would it have been different
if we'd had more time?

285
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:13,709
I'm not trying to give you
false hope, by the way.

286
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:15,920
-Could you, just a little?
-[laughs]

287
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,838
-Leave it open.
-Leave it open?

288
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,965
Even after this show is done,
I have a lot of time.

289
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,091
Ah…

290
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,594
I see. [chuckles]

291
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:27,765
I mean, we kind of know
how it would go, but…

292
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:31,727
[wistful music playing]

293
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:33,854
Hey, don't. Don't do that.

294
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,773
No, you don't need it.

295
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:37,149
[inhales deeply]

296
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,192
[exhales]

297
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:40,277
-How would it go?
-I was feeling stupid

298
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,154
for holding onto a sliver of hope

299
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,406
after everything.

300
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:48,953
But… at the same time,
I'm glad I still get to feel this way,

301
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:53,916
and… I've fully expressed my feelings
to you, so I have no regrets.

302
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,334
So,

303
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:57,127
you can give me hope.

304
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,004
[chuckles softly]

305
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,297
[laughs]

306
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:06,762
You know, like,

307
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:10,599
people usually start dancing
when they're a kid.

308
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:12,518
-Mm-hmm.
-If you start when you're young,

309
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,520
you can learn a bit more easily.

310
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:15,646
Right.

311
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,566
So maybe we couldn't communicate well

312
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,943
because we're learning
everything too late.

313
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,820
-Like dating.
-Yeah.

314
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,990
We're already too set in our ways.

315
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,201
I think I'm the type of person
who changes gradually.

316
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,329
-Oh, really?
-Without losing my identity.

317
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:35,833
[exhales] If we were
in the same class in school,

318
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,668
we would've sat next to each other.

319
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:41,297
-But I went to an all-girls school.
-Oh, that's right.

320
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,673
[Ji-su chuckles]

321
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:44,633
-And you're from Seoul…
-Just a hypothetical--

322
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:45,968
…and I'm from Ulsan.

323
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,470
-Ji-su keeps…
-[Han-na] Mmm.

324
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:49,680
…blocking him.

325
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:52,391
It's a wall. A wall you can't climb over.

326
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:54,560
-A thick wall…
-She's trying not to give him hope.

327
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:55,477
[Han-na] Right.

328
00:14:56,520 --> 00:15:00,232
So us meeting each other here
was destiny, in a way.

329
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,276
We didn't know we'd meet on this show

330
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:03,986
like this.

331
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:06,906
-So it's a shame.
-But if we had met earlier,

332
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:08,449
we wouldn't have talked like this.

333
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:10,826
You were always studying,
and I was a student-athlete.

334
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,745
-You're right.
-Yeah.

335
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:15,831
-So, meeting each other here, like this…
-Yeah.

336
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,708
…could've been our lucky chance.

337
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:20,377
[wistful music continues]

338
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,298
How sad.

339
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:25,341
It is.

340
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:27,635
-Mm. You okay?
-[cell phone chimes]

341
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:28,677
YOUR DATE HAS ENDED

342
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,179
[clicks tongue] Uh, yeah.

343
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,181
I'm sad. [inhales deeply]

344
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:34,016
Anyway…

345
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,728
I liked you so much, you won my heart.

346
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:39,480
-Mmm.
-You won my heart.

347
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:43,025
And I think I'll always
be grateful for that.

348
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,694
So, I wish you happiness.

349
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:48,697
I really liked you, Kang Ji-su.

351
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,702
Ahhh! My Gosh!

352
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:55,955
-[In-guk] Where can I hide?
-Wow!

353
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,581
-I'll see you…
-[Han-na] Oh, my gosh.

354
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:00,000
-…on my Instagram Explore page.
-[Han-na] Please, Hyun-kyu.

355
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:03,545
Kang Hyun-kyu. 26 years old.
Come on my YouTube channel.

356
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:04,546
[Eun-ji laughs]

357
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,966
Let's have you do
an Avatar Blind Date, man.

358
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:09,093
No, you can't even pretend to do that.

359
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:10,427
[chuckles]

360
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,638
I really liked you, Kang Ji-su.

361
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:15,265
[sweeping wistful music playing]

362
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:16,558
Someone might think

363
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,936
-we dated for several years.
-[Car laughs]

364
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,437
That's how it felt for me.

365
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:21,563
-It was so long.
-Really?

366
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,774
I'll look you up later.

367
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:25,359
I'll be waiting.

368
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:28,112
Don't… don't wait for me.
It's too much pressure.

369
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,154
Just deal with it.

370
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,782
Yeah, I'll do my best.
You just go and have fun.

371
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:32,908
Okay.

372
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,995
-[wolf whistle blows]

373
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,083
[music fades]

374
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,543
[sighing] Oh, gosh.

375
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:43,711
[sighs wearily]

376
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,880
-That was really intense.
-[Car] Wow.

377
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,590
-"I liked you, Kang Ji-su."
-Wow.

378
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:51,635
-"I liked you, Kang Ji-su."
-"Kang Ji-su!" He just put it out there.

379
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,138
Man, Hyun-kyu
was so beautifully honest with her.

380
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:55,597
That's why it's "let-it-out date."

381
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,391
-He definitely let it out.
-Sure did.

382
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:58,934
I wanna let something out now.

383
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:02,354
-I kind of… I feel embarrassed for him.
-[Han-na] I think he did really well.

384
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,565
[Eun-ji] Yeah, you have
second-hand embarrassment.

385
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:08,152
When Hyun-kyu sees this,
he'll have to let it out again.

386
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:09,403
[Han-na laughs]

387
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:11,488
[mellow music playing]

BY CHANCE

389
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:18,579
[Car] Ah.

390
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:21,331
She's making a statement
with her hair up like that.

391
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:22,916
Does that mean she changed her mind?

392
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,210
"I'll say what I wanna say.
No holding back."

MIN-HONG & JEONG-MOK

00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:36,638
Hi.

395
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:37,556
Hi.

396
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:40,726
Have fun yesterday?

397
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,187
-Yeah, I did.
-Good.

398
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:49,985
[chuckles softly]

399
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,320
[cell phone chimes]

400
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:54,364
-[Car] Oh, they requested each other.
-[In-guk] Right, Jeong-mok knew too.

401
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,617
I also… requested you.

402
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,993
-Huh?
-To talk.

403
00:17:58,577 --> 00:17:59,536
Oh.

404
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:03,290
Yeah, I mean,
it's good to wrap things up neatly.

405
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,252
-[music fades]
-[clicks tongue]

406
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,630
And this isn't anything serious, is it?

407
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:12,549
-So, to tell you the truth…
-Yeah?

408
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,843
…you were the only one
I had my eye on here.

409
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,179
Because good communication
is important to me,

410
00:18:17,262 --> 00:18:19,264
and I thought you did that well.

411
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:25,104
-But then, when we went to the sheep farm…
-Yeah.

412
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:26,647
…I asked you about it.

413
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:28,690
[solemn music playing]

414
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,192
-Am I, um…
-Hmm.

415
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:33,112
-Am I even in the running for you?
-Hmm?

416
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,614
At this point… [inhales]

417
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:37,199
are you considering me?

418
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:40,244
I am considering you.

419
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:44,748
Is it possible you won't know today,
tomorrow, or even the day after?

420
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,752
I don't know when, uh,
when I'll know for sure.

421
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:52,965
[music fades]

422
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:59,429
But to be honest, I knew that
I wasn't the one you were thinking about.

423
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:03,600
[Jae-yun] Before, Jeong-mok…
His top choice, it's Do.

424
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,104
And his second choice,
it changed to Ji-yeon.

425
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:09,898
-[breathes deeply]
-[solemn music playing]

426
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:11,775
Mmm.

427
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,237
I mean, maybe I was, but barely.

428
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:18,949
So I asked you, but you kept saying,

429
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:21,577
"I won't know tomorrow
or even the day after."

430
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,203
"I just don't know."

431
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:27,166
I really liked you as a person,

432
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:30,794
but as a guy,
you were going down in my estimation

433
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:32,254
-because of that. So…
-Okay.

434
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:38,802
I was kind of hoping you'd tell me
before going on your overnight date.

435
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:45,642
So, in the end, I was sort of
disappointed in you as a person too.

436
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:49,521
And I was really disappointed in you,
as a guy, for doing that.

437
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:54,067
That's how I felt, but despite that,

438
00:19:54,151 --> 00:19:59,031
Ji-yeon is still someone
who I've really gotten close to here,

439
00:19:59,114 --> 00:19:59,948
as a friend.

440
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:06,955
And now, I guess you're just someone
I used to have a crush on.

441
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,040
[chuckles softly]

442
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,209
[inhales]

443
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:11,960
Well…

444
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:13,503
[music fades]

445
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:17,216
So I just thought,
"I hope they have a lot of fun together."

446
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,927
"I hope they're not worried about me."

447
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,803
She's so cool.

448
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,640
She said she'd tell him off,
but in the end, she didn't.

449
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:25,933
[Han-na and Eun-ji exclaim]

450
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:28,101
There's nothing more to discuss.

451
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:30,229
We… we came here to be happy.

452
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:32,731
Thank you.

453
00:20:32,814 --> 00:20:34,775
[Jeong-mok] There wasn't much
left for me to say.

454
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:36,443
She already knew what I would say.

455
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,154
And I know I should've told her earlier.

456
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,490
I was thinking, "She must've resented me."

457
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:44,576
"I should've told her earlier."
I felt bad about that.

458
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:46,703
Great.

459
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:49,414
-Good luck.
-[chuckles softly]

460
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,625
I'll root for you.
I'll sincerely root for you.

461
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,086
Thank you for being
honest with me, Min-hong.

462
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:55,921
[resolute music playing]

463
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:57,506
[Min-hong] In my opinion,

464
00:20:57,589 --> 00:20:59,716
the people on other dating shows,

465
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,677
like Single's Inferno,

466
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,387
are like ceramics,

467
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,222
they're fixed and solid.

468
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:08,558
But we're not ceramics, we're clay.

469
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:12,020
We're in our early, mid,
and late twenties,

470
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:16,608
but we didn't do the things we should've
in our early twenties or teens.

471
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:21,655
While on this show,
I was able to get a sense of what I like,

472
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:23,448
what kind of relationship I want,

473
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:25,867
and what kind of person I want.

474
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,327
So that's enough.

475
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:31,748
So I think I can leave
everything behind me here,

476
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,417
without any regrets.

477
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,378
-[In-guk] Hmm. She's seriously so cool.
-[Eun-ji] Good job.

478
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:37,462
-She really is.
-Totally.

479
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,589
I didn't know Min-hong
would open up this much.

480
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:40,966
[Eun-ji] That was so nice.

481
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:43,385
Min-hong is
a pretty straightforward person.

482
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:44,636
-Yeah.
-[Eun-ji] Yep.

483
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,097
Some people could think
she's too aggressive,

484
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,891
but actually, she's really considerate.

485
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,018
Right.

486
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:53,937
And it must've been hard for her
after getting hurt by Jeong-mok,

487
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,064
-but she's cheering on this couple…
-[In-guk] Mmm.

488
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:58,233
-…that's beginning their relationship.
-Right.

489
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,901
-Right.
-She really is so considerate.

490
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,903
And listening to Min-hong…

491
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:04,531
Jeong-mok obviously knew
what he did wrong before…

492
00:22:04,614 --> 00:22:06,783
-[Han-na] Yeah, he knows.
-…and he certainly knows now.

493
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,618
-Also, he seems to feel it himself.
-True.

494
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:11,163
-Like, "I kind of regret that."
-[Han-na] Right.

495
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:13,165
-Isn't she the coolest?
-[Han-na] Yeah.

496
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,917
-Min-hong will be popular when this airs.
-Yes, Min-hong…

497
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:19,338
-She's such a charming person. Yes.
-People are gonna be lining up for her.

498
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:21,757
-[gentle sentimental music playing]
-[sniffles]

499
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:38,774
Watch your head.

500
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:40,192
Thank you.

501
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:42,486
Hi.

00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:46,531
LET-IT-OUT DATE
JEONG-MOK & DO

503
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,283
How have you been?

504
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:50,410
Good.

505
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:54,122
My heart felt a little heavy.

506
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:57,167
But… I can't really let that show,

507
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:00,003
because it must be
harder for her than it is for me.

508
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:01,922
What should I drink?

509
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:03,298
Should I?

510
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:05,133
-Oh, if we wait, they'll probably…
-What?

511
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,718
-Will they come?
-Yeah.

512
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,681
-So…
-You've been here a while?

513
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:13,225
Yeah.

514
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:18,939
-If you have something you wanna say…
-Mm-hmm.

515
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:21,149
-…maybe you should go first.
-Yeah, I will.

516
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,026
Mmm. [clicks tongue]

517
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,028
-Okay. I think that'd be best.
-Mmm.

518
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:25,946
Right.

519
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:29,032
How should I put it?

520
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:31,993
-We promised not to say sorry.
-[chuckles]

521
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:32,911
Good.

522
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:35,914
Thanks.

523
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,375
[gentle solemn music playing]

524
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,794
Looking at you, mmm,

525
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:43,088
not solely in a romantic way…

526
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:46,466
I thought you were cool, I sincerely did.

527
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,135
-Out of all of the people here…
-Really?

528
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:49,845
-…you were one of the coolest.
-Really?

529
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:50,971
-Yeah.
-What about me?

530
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:52,931
You work really hard.

531
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:54,182
Mmm.

532
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,226
You challenge things.

533
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:57,769
You're passionate.

534
00:23:57,853 --> 00:24:00,188
I don't think I've ever been like that,

535
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:03,108
-so I admire you.
-[chuckles softly]

536
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,527
You make me want to be better.

537
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,154
-Really? [chuckles]
-Yeah.

538
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:11,575
I feel like I should be more proactive
and work hard like Do.

539
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:15,078
-Mmm.
-I've really thought about that a lot.

540
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,831
[Jeong-mok] Hmm. [inhales softly]

541
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:23,128
I just want you to know
that you're a very attractive person.

542
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:26,131
Thank you.

543
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:27,674
[both chuckle]

544
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,968
Are we being way too serious?

545
00:24:30,051 --> 00:24:31,761
-I'll be even more serious.
-Too serious?

546
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:33,471
-Really?
-Let me know when you're ready.

547
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:34,848
-[laughs]
-[inhales sharply]

548
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:36,391
[exhales sharply, inhales]

549
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:38,268
-[Do] Mmm.
-Mmm.

550
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:39,895
[smacks lips] I…

551
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,521
-[Jeong-mok] Mmm?
-[music fades]

552
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:42,981
First…

553
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:46,318
[Do] Mmm…

554
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,613
-You're still…
-Mmm.

555
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:50,822
…it for me.

556
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:52,699
Mm-hmm.

557
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:55,744
So, I wanted to tell you that.

558
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:57,037
[sentimental music playing]

559
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,413
[smacks lips, chuckles softly]

560
00:24:58,496 --> 00:25:00,207
This was a short period of time.

561
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:03,460
-Right.
-But I ended up…

562
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,003
[sighs softly]

563
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,005
liking you…

564
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:11,426
a lot more than I expected.

565
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:13,762
So I'm really sad.

566
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:18,558
And to be completely honest with you…

567
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:23,396
When I told you what I liked about you,

568
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:28,568
you said, "Oh, I didn't know
I'd become the popular guy."

569
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:29,486
[chuckles] Yeah.

570
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:31,696
-I thought this could help.
-Mmm.

571
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:34,115
So I wanted to tell you.

572
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:38,620
Up until our date on Day 3,

573
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,789
I have to admit that

574
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:44,167
I was actually more attracted
to Seung-li than you.

575
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:49,965
But I knew that Seung-li
wasn't interested in me at all.

576
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,968
-Yeah, but--
-And I was really sad about that.

577
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:55,345
-It seems like, usually…
-Right.

578
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:57,597
-…the person I'm interested in…
-I see.

579
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,349
…isn't interested in me.

580
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:04,604
So I was really sad and upset…

581
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:08,441
and frustrated about that.

582
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:13,196
But then you and I
had that spot date in the evening.

583
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:17,033
-It was a random date too.
-Yeah.

584
00:26:17,701 --> 00:26:18,660
You got me twice.

585
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,370
-Yeah, it was great.
-Mmm.

586
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:24,499
[Do] Be good, Jeong-mok.

587
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:26,293
[music subsides]

588
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:27,210
[chuckles]

589
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:28,628
[music resumes]

590
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:29,629
Again?

591
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:33,091
-Oh, you're here again?
-We're matched again. [chuckles]

592
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:34,509
Wow. I mean, what is this?

593
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:36,511
-We didn't have time to talk until now…
-I know.

594
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:38,179
-…so should I get everything out?
-Mmm.

595
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:39,556
I was shocked just now.

596
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:45,645
If you get to choose
your date partner tomorrow,

597
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:47,063
-like we did today…
-Yeah.

598
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:48,273
…who would you choose?

599
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:50,942
I'll choose you, of course.

600
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:52,902
-Why?
-What?

601
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,864
I wanted to date you from the beginning.

602
00:26:57,615 --> 00:26:58,742
-Really?
-Yeah.

603
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:01,119
And then,

604
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:03,496
during that date…

605
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:07,000
you expressed to me

606
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:10,754
that you were interested in me,

607
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:12,797
romantically.

608
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:14,883
So…

609
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:16,885
I…

610
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:19,429
[sentimental music continues]

611
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:23,308
Mmm…

612
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:25,310
[inhales]

613
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:28,563
Hold on.

614
00:27:29,147 --> 00:27:31,191
Hey, I cry if I see someone else cry.

615
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:32,734
[both chuckle]

616
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,027
But I…

617
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:35,153
[music fades]

618
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:36,946
[voice breaking] So, at the time,

619
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:39,157
I thought…

620
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:41,284
[Do sniffles]

621
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:46,247
[inhales]

622
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:47,374
[sighs]

623
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:50,043
-You okay?
-Yeah.

624
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:52,587
-I thought…
-Yeah?

625
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:54,381
[inhales]

626
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:57,217
"Is this destiny?"
I let myself think it was.

627
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,302
[wistful music playing]

628
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:05,266
So I got really excited.

629
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,854
So, thank you for picking me…

630
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:11,689
Of course.

631
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:13,817
…when it was the guys' turn to pick.

632
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:15,944
-[Do sniffles]
-[exhales]

633
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:18,405
[sniffles]

634
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:20,782
-I'm okay.
-Really?

635
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:22,492
I'm okay.

636
00:28:22,575 --> 00:28:23,451
[chuckles]

637
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:24,911
[sniffles]

638
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:27,038
[tearfully] I'm okay.

639
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:28,915
[sniffles] So…

640
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:31,167
Well…

641
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:34,879
[breath trembling]

642
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:36,089
Hmm…

643
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:37,298
[sniffles]

644
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:39,676
So…

645
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:45,265
I've never really
gone on a date with… someone…

646
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:47,100
[music fades]

647
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:49,310
…who actually liked me back.

648
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:51,855
[sniffles softly]

649
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:54,482
So that made me really happy.

650
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:57,235
-[nostalgic music playing]
-[inhales]

651
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:58,737
[Jeong-mok] Oh.

652
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:01,239
I was going to put this in the mailbox,

653
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:03,241
-but I'll just give it to you now.
-For me?

654
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:04,868
-Yeah. I'll give it to you now.
-This?

655
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:07,412
-Open it later. Don't open it now.
-Not right now?

656
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:09,122
[Seung-li] Oh, it's so hot here.

657
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:11,249
-Right. Why is it so hot?
-How long will this take?

658
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:14,836
-[Seung-li] I'm gonna wait in my room.
-You want to come to our room?

659
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:17,088
-Bye.
-[Jeong-mok] I'll wait with you.

660
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:18,965
[indistinct chatter]

661
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:22,719
As for your school… [inhales sharply]

662
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:24,012
I'll come over often.

663
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,347
My school? Ah.

664
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:27,766
Isn't it too far?

665
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,642
I should still go.

666
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:31,311
[chuckles]

667
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:32,437
Wow!

668
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,813
[Jeong-mok] What?

669
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:35,815
-[Do] Yeah!
-[Yeo-myung] What was that?

670
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:37,817
[nostalgic music continues]

671
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:41,780
It didn't work out for us in the end,

672
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:49,078
but those moments we shared this week
will stay with me as beautiful memories.

673
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:51,915
[Do] Mmm. [sniffles]

674
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:53,333
[Do sighs]

675
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:56,169
Especially because…

676
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:59,130
it was you, Jeong-mok.

677
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:00,882
Mmm.

678
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,635
[chuckles]

679
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:05,845
I wasn't gonna cry.

680
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:07,388
[sniffles]

[inhales]

683
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:13,561
I…

684
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:16,231
I'm not cool.

685
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:18,775
[Do chuckles]

686
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:21,861
-So I think…
-Mm-hmm?

687
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:25,073
-…this will be the last conversation…
-Yeah.

688
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:26,741
…I ever have with you.

689
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,079
We won't see each other in Seoul.

690
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:32,872
Mmm.

00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:34,958
[sweeping sentimental music playing]

00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:39,045
Take care.

693
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:40,839
-[sniffles]
-Take care.

694
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:47,887
Take care of yourself, Do.

695
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:50,139
I will.

696
00:30:53,017 --> 00:30:53,977
[cell phone chimes]

697
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,770
YOUR DATE HAS ENDED

698
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:57,605
[Do sniffles]

699
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:02,569
[chair scrapes]

700
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:04,737
[sighs]

701
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:10,410
[sighs]

702
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:17,917
[sighs softly]

703
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:19,586
[music fades]

704
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:20,920
[Han-na sighs heavily]

705
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:24,132
-Right now, they're experiencing feelings…
-[Han-na] Yeah.

706
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:26,551
-…that you can't quite put into words.
-Right.

707
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:29,387
For Do, their relationship abruptly ended

708
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:32,223
right when she was starting
to really like Jeong-mok.

709
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:33,558
-Right.
-[Car] True.

710
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:35,602
That must've made it even harder.

711
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:38,146
-Do's feelings for him were this big.
-[Han-na] Right.

712
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:40,732
-Then she suddenly got cut off from him.
-[Car] Damn.

713
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:42,275
-That must've been so tough…
-Right.

714
00:31:42,358 --> 00:31:43,610
…especially 'cause her roommate

715
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:45,028
-was Ji-yeon.
-It was Ji-yeon.

716
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:48,031
Right, so she'd see them
after their dates.

717
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:49,866
-So hard.
-Must've been unbearable for Do.

718
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:52,035
Yeah, and for Jeong-mok,

719
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:54,913
his feelings changed
while he was getting to know her.

720
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:58,750
So I totally get how they both feel,

721
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:00,710
and I just feel so bad for them.

722
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:03,004
But I think
it was such a beautiful ending.

723
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:05,924
Instead of saying, "You did this wrong
and you did that wrong,"

724
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,508
-it was constructive.
-[In-guk] Right.

725
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:08,843
-It was a good ending.
-Exactly.

726
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,887
-I couldn't have said it like that.
-Me neither.

727
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,931
-"I liked you. You said you liked me."
-[laughs]

728
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:15,683
-You suddenly… Yeah, yeah, seriously.
-This guy is ridiculous.

729
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,226
"Hey, did I do something?"

730
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,938
-Right."Are you playing with me?"
-[Car] "You said you liked me."

731
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:21,356
[both laugh]

732
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,691
Honestly, it was a beautiful scene,

733
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:25,443
but it was a little bit ridiculous.

734
00:32:25,526 --> 00:32:26,361
It was.

735
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:28,154
For Do, he said he liked her first.

736
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:30,365
-[Han-na] I get that.
-Now he's saying something else.

737
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:33,618
And Do is just like, "I'm gonna
be myself," like what she always says.

738
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:36,287
-[Eun-ji] She has high self-esteem.
-She does.

739
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:39,207
-And she tries very hard to protect that.
-Mmm.

740
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,833
And Do even let some of that go,

741
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:43,086
-so she could open up her heart…
-[Eun-ji] Of course.

742
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:45,254
…but it didn't work out.

743
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:47,340
I think she must have been pretty upset.

744
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:50,969
[Seung-li] It's Ji-su.

745
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,470
[Ji-su] Of course. Who else?

746
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:53,638
[Han-na] Seung-li, Ji-su.

747
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:56,808
-Did you ask for me?
-Yeah.

748
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:02,355
-[Car] She still looks mad.
-[Han-na] Yeah, she does seem a bit angry.

749
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:05,525
It's a let-it-out date,
so say what you want.

750
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:08,528
-If you're upset, go ahead and say so.
-I'm not upset about anything.

751
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:09,779
You're not?

752
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:11,656
I really liked our conversation yesterday.

753
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,825
It was very impactful.

754
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:14,951
What?

755
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:16,619
He liked it?

756
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:18,621
He's really bad at reading the room.

757
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:20,206
Seung-li, get it together.

758
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:23,209
I think we said all there was to say.

759
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:26,170
-Oh, really?
-Is there more you wanted to say?

760
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:28,256
[mellow contemplative music playing]

761
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,509
Do you only want to hear
positive things right now?

762
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:33,886
Or do you want to hear my honest thoughts?

763
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:36,055
-Honest thoughts.
-Honest thoughts?

764
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:38,516
-I was irritated.
-Why?

765
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,476
-[scoffs]
-Because I left?

766
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,644
No.

767
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:46,190
You didn't remember
what I told you during our secret date.

768
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:48,234
That… that made me mad.

769
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:50,611
-[scoffs softly]
-No, I did remember.

770
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,198
Really? Then tell me. You're sober,
so you probably remember now.

771
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:57,869
-There was a lot of information, so--
-What did I say during our secret date?

772
00:33:57,952 --> 00:34:01,456
I mentioned why I was looking
for a certain kind of person. [scoffs]

773
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:04,292
[inhales] Yeah, a very selfish person--

774
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,169
-Not that.
-Not that?

775
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:07,628
Who didn't pressure you…

776
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,589
Nope. [scoffs]

777
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:12,050
And that you needed time to think.

778
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,426
No.

779
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:15,928
There was just a lot.

780
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:19,390
You should be thankful
I'm wearing sneakers instead of slippers.

781
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:21,559
If I had slippers on,
I would've thrown them at you.

782
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:23,811
I'll think of it by this evening then.

783
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,313
Oh, forget it.

784
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:26,647
[tense music playing]

785
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:32,403
-Come on, just say you're really sorry.
-Yeah. Saying sorry is the right response.

786
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:35,281
I clearly told you that,

787
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,325
when I was young,

788
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:42,997
I… was a victim of somebody stalking me.

789
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:46,042
And that I didn't like
being the center of gossip,

790
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:48,503
and that it scares me
when people are standing behind me.

791
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:51,798
-Yeah.
-That took a lot of courage for me to say.

792
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:54,509
I usually don't even
talk to my close friends about that.

793
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:59,180
But… I told you, so you could be aware,
and you didn't remember it.

794
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:02,100
So I thought,
"Why am I talking to a drunk about this?"

795
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:04,018
[pensive music playing]

796
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,853
That was my fault, my bad.

797
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:08,606
I seem mellower now,
but I was really upset.

798
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:11,442
You must've been.
I could tell you were really upset.

799
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:12,360
[Ji-su] Mmm.

800
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:14,987
-So, I did mess up yesterday.
-Yeah.

801
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:18,366
[Ji-su] It made me like him less.

802
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:20,868
He said he messed up.

803
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:23,955
Will Seung-li's indifferent attitude

804
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:28,292
and my sensitive personality
mesh well? I'm not sure.

805
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:31,921
Because I was
already wavering at that point.

806
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:35,383
Did you request someone else too?

807
00:35:36,551 --> 00:35:37,802
-Hyun-kyu.
-Really?

808
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:39,762
-[music fades]
-[Seung-li] Hmm.

809
00:35:39,846 --> 00:35:41,681
[gulps] How was it?

810
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:43,558
Well… [sighs]

811
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:46,978
we were going to talk about
how we really felt,

812
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:50,148
but then we said,
"Let's only talk about good things."

813
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:52,191
-Mmm.
-So we did.

814
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:54,235
I get that.

815
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:56,487
Hyun-kyu is a good person.

816
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:57,655
Yeah, he is.

817
00:35:57,738 --> 00:36:00,116
He might be different
in a romantic context.

818
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,910
-He's good in a romantic sense too.
-Mm-hmm.

819
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:06,247
-Right.
-If it was some random person,

820
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,666
I wouldn't feel bad turning them down.

821
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,502
Like, who cares if they cry?

822
00:36:11,586 --> 00:36:13,379
But I liked him, so it did hurt.

823
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:16,048
[inhales]

824
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:17,675
Mmm.

825
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:19,760
Hmm.

826
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:23,097
[Seung-li] Hyun-kyu was there before me.

827
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,807
It didn't bother me that much.

828
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:28,811
I only thought, "What can I do for Ji-su?"

829
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:30,855
I was focused on myself.

830
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:34,025
But she's not liking it, Seung-li.
Please do better.

831
00:36:34,108 --> 00:36:36,027
[Seung-li] I promise I'll remember it now.

832
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,695
[Ji-su] I can't trust you.

833
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:38,821
[quirky music playing]

834
00:36:38,905 --> 00:36:41,115
-You're going to your room?
-I'm going to the Lounge.

835
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,909
-Then I'm going to my room.
-Seriously?

836
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:45,536
You're running away? That makes me sad.

837
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,246
Ugh, you're making me mad.

838
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,248
[chuckles]

839
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,628
[Seung-li hums cheerfully]

840
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:55,796
-Come on, Seung-li!
-[Car] Why is he so happy?

841
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,090
I don't think this is gonna work out.

842
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:00,718
"Ddururu." It's not the time for that.

843
00:37:00,801 --> 00:37:03,512
Oh, is it because he hasn't dated before?

844
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:06,390
Since he's always been around guy friends,

845
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:10,019
he didn't really have to listen
to what they were saying.

846
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:12,688
And some people
really don't remember stuff.

847
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:14,857
-[chuckles] Yeah.
-[Car] Like, I have a friend

848
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:19,403
who can't remember things that
other people would normally remember,

849
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:21,405
regardless of the level of importance.

850
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:23,699
-I think he's really similar.
-[Eun-ji and Han-na] Oh.

851
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:26,494
But it doesn't mean
that he doesn't like that person.

852
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:29,080
-Right, right.
-He's thinking, "Is that important?"

853
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:30,831
"I just like this girl."

854
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:33,209
-That's his thought process.
-He is that type of person.

855
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:36,754
But the issue is that this wasn't just
any story she was telling him.

856
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:38,464
-It was serious.
-Normally, it'd be okay.

857
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:41,759
If it weren't, she'd be like, "It's okay.
Who cares if you remember or not."

858
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:43,135
"That's just how you are."

859
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:44,345
She might say that.

860
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:47,098
But she shared an important secret
that really mattered to her…

861
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:48,808
-Right.
-…and he couldn't remember it.

862
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:50,226
I think that's why she got mad.

863
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:52,812
-[Han-na] Right.
-He was the polar opposite of Hyun-kyu.

864
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:55,898
-Yeah, they're totally different.
-Hyun-kyu, yes… Hyun-kyu makes me say,

865
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:57,650
-"Wow, that far?"
-[Eun-ji] Yeah.

866
00:37:57,733 --> 00:38:00,278
-He has so much intense affection for her.
-Right, right.

867
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:02,989
-And Seung-li is a bit too indifferent.
-[Eun-ji] Agreed.

868
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:05,658
Okay, say they're
the last two people on Earth.

869
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:08,452
Which type would you two date?
Seung-li, Hyun-kyu?

870
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:09,954
I don't have to think about it.

871
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:11,539
-[In-guk] Oh.
-I'd pick Hyun-kyu.

872
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:12,915
-[gasps]
-[In-guk] Oh, really?

873
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:14,750
Even if they can be awkward,

874
00:38:14,834 --> 00:38:17,378
I always prefer kind and sincere people.

875
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:19,630
"I liked you, Kang Han-na!"
Even if he says that?

876
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,132
-Hyun-kyu would be like this.
-No.

877
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:23,259
When Han-na is at a film shoot, Hyun-kyu…

878
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:25,177
-[amusing music playing]
-[laughter]

879
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:28,014
Look! He crossed his legs!

880
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:30,057
-Oh, my God, you crossed your legs!
-Han-na.

881
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:32,560
It's so cute because you can feel
how sincere he is.

882
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:35,521
-Assuming he's also a kind person.
-But, like, if you're on a shoot…

883
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:38,399
-Yeah.
-…and then he drives up in a coffee truck…

884
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:39,483
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

885
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,944
Rolls down the window and says,
"I love you, Kang Han-na!"

886
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:43,321
"I love you, Kang Han-na!"

887
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:44,989
-Can you handle that?
-No.

888
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:48,284
-Everyone's looking at you standing still.
-[Han-na] No, I can't handle that.

889
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:50,328
-The last…
-[both laughing]

890
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,871
And you're reading your script,

891
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:54,915
and he quietly comes over.
"I didn't know what you'd like to drink…"

892
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,792
-Wow! That's pretty good.
-The way he talks…

893
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:59,503
-"I have adlay tea but…"
-Just listening to that, I feel a little…

894
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:00,671
Wow, that's just like him.

895
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:03,215
But if they're the only two guys
left on Earth…

896
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:04,842
-With someone like Hyun-kyu…
-Yeah.

897
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:06,886
-…at least you can talk to him.
-[Eun-ji] I agree.

898
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:09,472
He could actually
fix some things about himself.

899
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:11,098
-[Eun-ji] Right.
-But I feel Seung-li

900
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:13,559
is just too indifferent about everything.

901
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:14,769
[laughs]

902
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:16,896
Seung-li probably
wouldn't notice if you left.

903
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:19,940
Yeah, whether I'm away on a film shoot,
if I'm off meeting friends,

904
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:21,609
-he wouldn't notice.
-"What drama?"

905
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:25,363
-[Han-na] "Is it a movie or a TV drama?"
-And… "Ddururu." "Guys, come to my place."

906
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:27,365
-Even after months of filming.
-"Ddururu." Nice!

907
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:29,867
-And he'd keep being competitive.
-[Car] Mmm.

908
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:32,036
If I had to choose,
I'd definitely choose Hyun-kyu.

909
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:34,121
-[Car] Mmm.
-I'd definitely choose Seung-li.

910
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,039
[Han-na] Seung-li?

911
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:37,625
-You're so consistent. Why pick him?
-Yes, I'm consistent, yes.

912
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:40,503
So, with Seung-li,
I think he could improve.

913
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:42,546
If you tell him,
"Why don't you remember that?"

914
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,757
"That really bothers me,
try to remember next time."

915
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:47,051
-He'd change. He's a simple guy.
-"Yes, sir!" Like that.

916
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:48,135
He'd be like, "Yes, sir!"

917
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,846
-No, he'd just forget.
-He'd be more comfortable to date.

918
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,890
-Wow, we're totally divided on this.
-Yeah, yeah.

919
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:55,768
-[cell phone chimes]
-[Sang-ho] You got that?

920
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:58,229
-[Car] The last Eternal Singles' Night.
-[cell phone chimes]

921
00:39:58,312 --> 00:39:59,688
-[Do] Oh, a message.
-A message.

922
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:01,982
[Min-hong] It's the last
Eternal Singles' Night.

923
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:03,192
[Yeo-myung] Excited?

924
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:05,653
[Min-hong] I'm excited
to see what happens.

925
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:07,655
[Yeo-myung] I'm excited, but a bit scared.

926
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:09,865
"The Night of Truth?"

927
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:11,075
Ah!

928
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,077
"The Night of Truth."

929
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,620
"The Night of Truth."

930
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:17,289
[chuckles] What's "The Night of Truth"?

931
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:19,542
Seriously, what truth?

932
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:22,044
[Eun-ji] "The Night of Truth,"
on the last day? I like it.

933
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:23,963
-No, no.
-I'm okay now.

934
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:26,215
-Are we playing "Tie the Clam Shells?"
-[Sang-ho] Wow.

935
00:40:26,298 --> 00:40:29,135
TONIGHT IS THE NIGHT OF TRUTH
PLAY "TRUTH OR DARE"

936
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:30,761
TO HEAR EACH OTHER'S HONEST THOUGHTS

937
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:33,973
-"Choose your punishment?"
-[chuckles] Jump over the fire?

938
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:35,474
[all laughing]

939
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:38,477
-Hey, is this a circus?
-You choose someone?

940
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:41,355
THE SELECTED PERSON CHOOSES A CARD
AND ANSWERS THE QUESTION ON IT

941
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:42,565
[Sang-ho] What should it be?

942
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:44,733
[Seung-li] Pour me some… Pour some soju.

943
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:47,194
There's a punishment.
They really have to tell the truth.

944
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,029
-[In-guk] The truth.
-The game of truth.

945
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:52,116
They could ask questions like,
"What did you mean by that?"

946
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:54,118
Clarifying questions. Yeah, yeah.

947
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:55,661
They have to lay it all out.

948
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:57,413
[Sang-ho] No, no.

949
00:40:57,496 --> 00:40:59,915
[Hyun-kyu] Who'll ask first?
Sang-ho, you should ask first.

950
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:01,375
Okay.

951
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:03,794
Uh…

952
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:07,006
-Seung-li?
-[Mi-ji] Seung-li?

953
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:08,466
-[Sang-ho] Yeah.
-No, Seung-li…

954
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:09,967
He kind of glared at you.

955
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:11,802
-I did?
-[Ji-yeon] Yeah. [chuckles]

956
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:12,845
-I did?
-[Ji-yeon] Yeah.

957
00:41:12,928 --> 00:41:15,848
Uh, "What do you wish
your crush would say to you?"

958
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:16,891
[laughs]

959
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:18,267
Why did you pick me?

960
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:20,561
-[all laughing]
-[mellow music playing]

961
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:22,354
-Why are you laughing?
-[Hyun-kyu] Nothing.

962
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:23,647
[Seung-chan] Oh!

963
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:26,192
It's really simple. Maybe something like,

964
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:28,903
-"Let's talk tonight."
-[Sang-ho] Oh.

965
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:30,237
Just talking to her

966
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:33,491
-is always fun.
-Great conversationalist.

967
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:35,493
-[Mi-ji] The game's starting.
-[laughter]

968
00:41:35,576 --> 00:41:37,703
-[Seung-li] You always chime in.
-Yeah, seriously.

969
00:41:37,786 --> 00:41:39,663
-Sang-ho.
-Oh, it's me again?

970
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:41,290
Yeah.

971
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:45,669
"What's been
the most exciting moment in Jeju?"

972
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:47,004
Oh, in Jeju,

973
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:48,172
[Ji-yeon] Here you go.

974
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:49,089
Well…

975
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:50,883
Be honest. You had fun with Ji-su.

976
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:52,426
-And Mi-ji, too.
-[Sang-ho] Mmm…

977
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:56,180
-The dinners?
-[laughter]

978
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:57,556
-[gasps]
-[Cupids laughing]

979
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,474
[In-guk] I knew it.

980
00:41:58,557 --> 00:42:01,101
-[amusing music playing]
-[laughing]

981
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:02,186
-Drink.
-You gotta drink.

982
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:03,395
[Yeo-myung] Drink for that.

983
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:05,022
-[Mi-ji] What is this?
-Drink it all.

984
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:06,732
-Drink it and jump in there.
-[laughing]

985
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:09,026
-[Sang-ho] That's too intense.
-[laughter]

986
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:11,654
-I wanna survive this.
-[Yeo-myung laughs] To a long life.

987
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:13,113
But at least you're honest.

988
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:14,573
[chuckling] You are.

989
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:16,909
-You need to pick someone first.
-Jae-yun.

990
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:18,827
-[music fades]
-[Sang-ho coughs]

991
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:23,999
"Tell us a moment
when you lied out of kindness."

992
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:26,043
-[Mi-ji] To Jae-yun?
-A moment?

993
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:28,420
[In-guk] This is
a really good question for Jae-yun.

994
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:30,673
-What?
-To Jae-yun?

995
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:33,050
-You really picked that?
-[Seung-chan] No, to Jae-yun.

996
00:42:33,592 --> 00:42:35,803
[exhales, chuckles]
Hey, that… that was good.

997
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:37,846
There was a time when I lied.

998
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:43,519
I remember,
it was the night of the secret date.

999
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:46,605
I heard that she was interested in…

1000
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:48,482
someone else,

1001
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:50,276
so…

1002
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:51,902
[mellow music playing]

1003
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:54,572
-[chuckles]
-[Ji-su] Take your time. It's okay.

1004
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:55,948
I lied and I said,

1005
00:42:56,532 --> 00:43:00,160
"I'm actually not interested in you,
you should focus on that person."

1006
00:43:01,036 --> 00:43:01,996
That's cool.

1007
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,164
-[Seung-chan] Okay. Let's move on.
-[Min-hong] I see.

1008
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:08,877
[Jae-yun] I wanted to
apologize to Yeo-myung,

1009
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:12,756
because I realized my lie
could've made things hard for her.

1010
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:15,134
So, I kept lying.

1011
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:17,303
I wish I hadn't.

1012
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:18,679
Yeah.

1013
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:20,472
-I felt bad about it.
-Yeah.

1014
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:24,935
After that happened,
I thought about it and… I realized…

1015
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:27,563
I was wrong.

1016
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:30,566
I get what you're saying. [chuckles]

1017
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:33,110
Thank you. You've grown a lot, I think.

1018
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:34,403
-I hope so.
-[chuckles]

1019
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:37,656
So we were able to talk about that.

1020
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:42,828
It felt like finishing
my last… assignment.

1021
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:44,413
[Mi-ji] Jae-yun.

1022
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:48,876
"What's the most charming aspect
of your crush?"

1023
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:52,880
-Her smile…
-[Jeong-mok] Aw.

1024
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:54,757
Her sunny smile?

1025
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:56,759
-[Sang-ho] Oh.
-[Mi-ji] Sunny smile?

1026
00:43:56,842 --> 00:43:58,636
-[Jae-yun] Yeah.
-I'm jealous.

1027
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:00,095
-Wow.
-She must be very beautiful.

1028
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:01,096
[Mi-ji laughs]

1029
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,307
[Seung-chan] Nothing like a great smile.

1030
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:06,352
[Jae-yun] I was
very comfortable talking to her.

1031
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:08,228
She felt like a close friend.

1032
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:11,649
[Yeo-myung] Oh, yeah.
Jae-yun really did grow.

1033
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:12,858
And I'm glad he did.

1034
00:44:15,861 --> 00:44:17,863
-Yeah, he really evolved.
-[Eun-ji] Really.

1035
00:44:17,946 --> 00:44:19,740
-They've all grown.
-[Eun-ji] Yeah.

1036
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:21,241
-I can see that he's grown…
-Right.

1037
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:22,326
-…a lot.
-Of course.

1038
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:24,078
-[Han-na] For sure.
-Throughout this show,

1039
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:26,830
Jae-yun was always dear to my heart.

1040
00:44:28,957 --> 00:44:30,125
-Little by little…
-Mmm.

1041
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:31,919
…he kept trying to do more,

1042
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:33,754
-and I felt so proud…
-[Han-na] Right.

1043
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:36,924
…but also anxious
because he's so inexperienced.

1044
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:38,676
He made some mistakes along the way,

1045
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:40,260
but today,

1046
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:45,015
I really thought, "Wow, this kid
has grown a lot." I'm so proud of him.

1047
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:46,183
-[Eun-ji] Mmm.
-Mmm.

1048
00:44:48,977 --> 00:44:49,853
Jeong-mok.

1049
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:51,271
Yep.

1050
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:54,149
"Who gave the most memorable
first impression?"

1051
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:56,443
-Most memorable?
-Yeah, first impression.

1052
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:57,945
[Sang-ho] That's different.

1053
00:44:58,028 --> 00:45:00,072
[tense music playing]

1054
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:02,491
-[Jeong-mok] Well… One person?
-[Mi-ji] Most memorable.

1055
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:04,827
[Han-na] Neither of them
can look at Jeong-mok.

1056
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:08,997
-For me, Do.
-[Mi-ji] Do?

1057
00:45:09,081 --> 00:45:10,999
-Pink.
-[Seung-chan] Ah, pink.

1058
00:45:11,083 --> 00:45:12,000
[Sang-ho] Oh…

1059
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:13,877
-[Seung-chan] So obvious.
-Pink princess.

1060
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:15,087
[inhales sharply]

1061
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:16,547
Hmm.

1062
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:18,340
[tense music continues]

1063
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:22,636
[music fades]

1064
00:45:22,719 --> 00:45:24,346
-Jeong-mok.
-[Jeong-mok] Yeah?

1065
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:27,516
"Whose book did you open first
in the 5 Minute Library?"

1066
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:29,852
Mmm…

1067
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:31,228
Oh, Do's.

1068
00:45:32,354 --> 00:45:33,689
[Han-na gasps] It's Do again.

1069
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:35,482
[Car] Well, he can't lie about it.

1070
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:37,734
[sentimental music playing]

1071
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:40,571
I want to ask Do a question.

1072
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:45,409
"If you had one last date tomorrow,
who would you pick?"

1073
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:51,748
The person I'd want one last date with?

1074
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:54,960
Well…

1075
00:45:58,172 --> 00:46:01,008
This is hard.
There are too many attractive guys.

1076
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:02,509
[Do laughs]

1077
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:04,803
Too many seductive guys here.

1078
00:46:06,889 --> 00:46:07,931
Well…

1079
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:14,980
I'd pick…

1080
00:46:16,064 --> 00:46:16,899
Jeong-mok.

1081
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:18,358
[Sang-ho] Oh.

1082
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:21,278
[sentimental music rises]

1083
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:25,449
[Yeo-myung] These questions…

1084
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:27,576
-[Sang-ho] Choose someone.
-[Ji-su] Who hasn't gone?

1085
00:46:28,118 --> 00:46:30,412
[Do] For both the first impression pick

1086
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:33,165
and the 5 Minute Library,

1087
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:35,501
it was me.

1088
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:40,047
Jeong-mok was always honest.

1089
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:44,510
So I thought, "Mmm… he's a cool person."

1090
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:49,598
I'm still only interested in Jeong-mok.

1091
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:54,353
I'm really angry with him
for the way he's treated me,

1092
00:46:54,436 --> 00:46:56,355
but I still like him.

1093
00:46:56,438 --> 00:46:57,731
[music fades]

1094
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:01,777
[tense music playing]

1095
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:09,493
[Sang-ho coughs] Whoa.

1096
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:13,622
-[Han-na] Ah.
-Wow, this is uncomfortable.

1097
00:47:13,705 --> 00:47:15,749
-[Han-na] Oh, no.
-It can't be helped.

1098
00:47:15,832 --> 00:47:19,169
-Honest feelings are uncomfortable.
-[Han-na] It's weirdly uncomfortable.

1099
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:20,712
I pick…

1100
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:21,964
[music fades]

1101
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:23,048
Who hasn't gone?

1102
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:24,675
Ji-yeon.

1103
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:27,219
[paper rustles]

1104
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:29,471
"Describe the person you like
in just one word."

1105
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:30,847
-[Sang-ho] Huh?
-Oh.

1106
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:32,599
[Seung-chan chuckles] This should be fun.

1107
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:35,060
-[Yeo-myung] This question's great.
-[Hyun-kyu] This is fun.

1108
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:39,231
One word? Mmm… "Comfort"?

1109
00:47:39,314 --> 00:47:40,399
[contestants exclaiming]

1110
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:44,236
[Han-na] They're already
comfortable with each other. Mmm.

1111
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:46,989
[tense music playing]

1112
00:47:50,867 --> 00:47:52,995
Doesn't Ji-yeon look
kind of different now?

1113
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:54,663
-[laughs]
-Yeah, she does.

1114
00:47:54,746 --> 00:47:57,165
Kind of like Madam Jeong from Tazza.

1115
00:47:57,249 --> 00:47:59,293
[Car] How did Ji-yeon
suddenly become like this?

1116
00:47:59,376 --> 00:48:01,753
-[Han-na] "Madam Jeong." Yeah, a little.
-[Eun-ji] Right?

1117
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:03,130
I mean, yeah, she does.

1118
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:04,047
Oh, kind of.

1119
00:48:04,131 --> 00:48:06,675
You all saw it too, right?
"Do you call that a question?"

1120
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:08,802
-She looks so strong.
-"You call that a question?"

1121
00:48:08,885 --> 00:48:11,179
I think that question
annoyed her a little bit.

1122
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:13,599
-Like, "That's my man."
-[In-guk] Maybe?

1123
00:48:13,682 --> 00:48:15,976
-[Han-na] Like a silent warning?
-[Min-hong] I don't know.

1124
00:48:16,476 --> 00:48:17,769
I pick…

1125
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:19,646
Jeong-mok.

1126
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,189
[Seung-chan] Oh, hey!

1127
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:23,275
[inhales sharply] "How many…

1128
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:24,818
Wow.

1129
00:48:24,901 --> 00:48:27,321
-…people are in your heart right now?"
-[contestants exclaim]

1130
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:29,740
-[Seung-chan] He's a sniper.
-[Sang-ho] Wait…

1131
00:48:29,823 --> 00:48:31,908
Wow, how are the questions so perfect?

1132
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:33,160
[tense music playing]

1133
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:34,786
Man, this is intense.

1134
00:48:35,662 --> 00:48:38,165
-Way to put him on the spot.
-[Hyun-kyu] If you're not honest…

1135
00:48:42,210 --> 00:48:43,045
[laughter]

1136
00:48:43,128 --> 00:48:45,505
[Sang-ho] You're good at picking these.
You're Tazza.

1137
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:46,882
-[laughter]
-Just one person.

1138
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:48,175
[Seung-chan] Was this planned?

1139
00:48:48,258 --> 00:48:50,677
-[Jeong-mok] Just one person.
-[Seung-chan] Was this planned?

1140
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:53,138
-[Eun-ji] My gosh…
-[Han-na] Her smile suddenly disappeared.

1141
00:48:53,221 --> 00:48:54,431
[Eun-ji] Oh, no, oh, no…

1142
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:56,642
[In-guk] Yeah, and Ji-yeon
is smiling right away.

1143
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:58,393
[tense music continues]

1144
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:03,231
-[Car] Oh!
-[Han-na gasps]

1145
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:05,859
[Han-na gasps]

1146
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:15,369
[Do] Hmm…
I'm just feeling really heartbroken.

1147
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:18,955
Being in the same space
as them is so hard.

1148
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:21,708
[tearfully] Can't they stop showing off?

1149
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:24,252
[sniffles]

1150
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:26,505
[cries] That's what I thought.

1151
00:49:27,047 --> 00:49:29,049
[tense music continues]

1152
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:36,473
[In-guk sighing] Oh, no.

1153
00:49:36,973 --> 00:49:38,684
[Car] He needs to be clear.

1154
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:41,269
-Oh, man, this is rough.
-[Eun-ji] Her heart--

1155
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:44,022
Do has really gone through
a painful last three days.

1156
00:49:44,856 --> 00:49:46,650
-It hurts to see that.
-[Eun-ji] Yeah.

1157
00:49:46,733 --> 00:49:48,944
-But I think they're growing pains.
-[Eun-ji] Right.

1158
00:49:49,027 --> 00:49:50,404
First loves are always painful.

1159
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:52,906
-[Eun-ji] Yeah, they are, that's true.
-They just always are.

1160
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:54,658
-Can I go?
-Yeah.

1161
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:55,575
Yeah, go.

1162
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:59,996
Ji-yeon and Jeong-mok are the only couple
who went on an overnight date, right?

1163
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:02,290
So are you sure about each other?

1164
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:05,877
Do you think, after this show,
that you two will, uh…

1165
00:50:05,961 --> 00:50:07,546
Are you asking both of us?

1166
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:08,463
[Ji-su] Yeah.

1167
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:10,132
I am.

1168
00:50:10,215 --> 00:50:11,633
-[Ji-su] You're certain?
-Yeah.

1169
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:13,510
-[Ji-su] Jeong-mok?
-I am too.

1170
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:16,221
[Mi-ji] Oh, what? Can you two just drink?

1171
00:50:16,304 --> 00:50:17,931
[laughter]

1172
00:50:18,014 --> 00:50:19,182
[indistinct chatter]

1173
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:21,852
[Mi-ji] I'm jealous.

1174
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:25,939
Can I ask the same question

1175
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:29,568
-to Ji-su and Seung-li?
-[Sang-ho chuckles]

1176
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:32,070
If I say no, will you not ask?

1177
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:34,740
No, no, I still will. Are you certain…

1178
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:38,452
that you two will date after the show?

1179
00:50:40,912 --> 00:50:41,913
Me?

1180
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:42,998
[Jeong-mok] Both of you.

1181
00:50:43,081 --> 00:50:45,667
I am. I… I am.

1182
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:47,753
Ji-su?

1183
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:49,379
-Do I have to answer?
-Yeah.

1184
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:50,630
[Hyun-kyu] Or you can drink.

1185
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:52,841
[pensive music playing]

1186
00:50:58,472 --> 00:50:59,931
90% certain.

1187
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,475
Good question.

1188
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:09,399
I have a question for Hyun-kyu.

1189
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:11,443
So for a while,

1190
00:51:11,526 --> 00:51:13,904
-we were competing with each other.
-[Hyun-kyu] Yeah.

1191
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:15,405
[Seung-li] So…

1192
00:51:16,072 --> 00:51:18,283
Are you uncomfortable with this?

1193
00:51:19,284 --> 00:51:20,577
Are we cool?

1194
00:51:22,287 --> 00:51:23,246
[Hyun-kyu] Well…

1195
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:27,793
I think yesterday
was the most uncomfortable.

1196
00:51:29,294 --> 00:51:30,128
Today feels…

1197
00:51:31,087 --> 00:51:32,088
bittersweet?

1198
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:34,758
[Seung-chan] Bittersweet?

1199
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:36,885
[music fades]

1200
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:38,053
[Yeo-myung] Hyun-kyu…

1201
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:41,515
"Who do you want to
keep in touch with after the show?"

1202
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:43,141
[Do] Oh.

1203
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:44,851
-Hmm…
-[Sang-ho] Oh, damn.

1204
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:46,853
[indistinct chuckling]

1205
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:48,772
The person I want to keep in touch with?

1206
00:51:49,439 --> 00:51:50,482
[inhales deeply]

1207
00:51:50,982 --> 00:51:52,275
[sighs heavily]

1208
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:55,695
-[Yeo-myung laughs] Okay, okay.
-[Sang-ho] That question sucks.

1209
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:57,948
[Mi-ji] Oh, it doesn't have to be a guy.
It doesn't.

1210
00:51:58,031 --> 00:51:59,074
Such an annoying question.

1211
00:51:59,157 --> 00:52:00,992
[Seung-chan] You said you'd keep in touch.

1212
00:52:01,076 --> 00:52:02,494
Oh, didn't I have to choose a girl?

1213
00:52:02,577 --> 00:52:04,788
-It should be a girl.
-Right, it should be a girl.

1214
00:52:04,871 --> 00:52:08,333
-[Hyun-kyu] With the guys… Ah…
-[sentimental music playing]

1215
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:11,920
I think it could be a little uncomfortable
to hang out alone with Seung-li.

1216
00:52:12,587 --> 00:52:14,381
That might be a little awkward.

1217
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:17,384
I want to keep in touch
with everyone else though.

1218
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:19,761
And for the girls, Ji-su is the one.

1219
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:21,179
[inhales]

1220
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:23,390
I want her contact info,
but maybe I don't.

1221
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:25,225
Because if I can see her,

1222
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:28,061
then I'm not gonna
be able to stop thinking about her.

1223
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:31,690
I almost think I have to stop seeing her

1224
00:52:31,773 --> 00:52:34,860
in order to move on and do other things.

1225
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:37,320
But if, by any chance,

1226
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:41,825
I still have some hope with her,
then I wanna… [exhales]

1227
00:52:41,908 --> 00:52:43,034
I wanna keep trying.

1228
00:52:43,952 --> 00:52:45,161
[sighs]

1229
00:52:45,245 --> 00:52:46,830
[firewood crackling]

1230
00:52:46,913 --> 00:52:48,164
[music fades]

1231
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:49,916
I want to ask Ji-su a question.

1232
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:51,918
[Hyun-kyu] Hmm.

1233
00:52:53,044 --> 00:52:54,379
[Hyun-kyu inhales]

1234
00:52:54,462 --> 00:52:56,172
You said 90% certain.

1235
00:52:56,882 --> 00:52:58,174
What's the other ten?

1236
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:00,594
-[chuckles, sniffles]
-[others chuckling]

1237
00:53:00,677 --> 00:53:01,511
Wow.

1238
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:03,471
-[exhales]
-[pensive music playing]

1239
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:05,181
-Good question.
-[Seung-chan] Drink.

1240
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:06,391
Give her a break.

1241
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:14,274
-I'm gonna drink.
-[Mi-ji] Oh, okay.

1242
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:15,567
[Min-hong] Yeah, drink, drink.

1243
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:25,952
[grunts]

1244
00:53:31,958 --> 00:53:32,918
[Ji-su inhales]

1245
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:35,128
[sighs sharply]

1246
00:53:37,464 --> 00:53:39,215
[Ji-su] Jeong-mok and Ji-yeon

1247
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:42,886
said they were certain they would date
after the show was over.

1248
00:53:43,595 --> 00:53:44,763
I was kind of…

1249
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:46,556
jealous of that.

1250
00:53:48,224 --> 00:53:52,938
I also… [chuckles softly]
want to meet someone I get along with.

1251
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:56,274
I wanted to be able
to tell that to Seung-li,

1252
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:59,027
but I couldn't bring myself to say it.

1253
00:54:00,153 --> 00:54:01,529
So I was a bit jealous

1254
00:54:02,030 --> 00:54:03,615
and a bit sad too.

1255
00:54:04,658 --> 00:54:07,786
I do think that Seung-li is a good person.

1256
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:09,829
But, mmm…

1257
00:54:10,872 --> 00:54:12,791
"Is this relationship sustainable?"

1258
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:16,419
That was that 10% uncertainty.

1259
00:54:21,466 --> 00:54:22,342
[music fades]

1260
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:24,803
-[Ji-su] Can I ask a question?
-[Mi-ji] Yeah.

1261
00:54:24,886 --> 00:54:27,639
[chuckling] It kinda feels like
I'm digging myself into a hole,

1262
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:31,643
but did you ever resent me
or regret things

1263
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:36,022
because I made you wait
for so long? [cries]

1264
00:54:41,569 --> 00:54:42,779
No, I didn't at all.

1265
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:48,034
I still had hope.

1266
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:51,037
[gentle solemn music playing]

1267
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:52,163
You don't hate me?

1268
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:53,456
I don't hate you.

1269
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:54,708
[Ji-su] You don't?

1270
00:54:54,791 --> 00:54:57,127
I stayed because I wanted to.
How could I hate you?

1271
00:54:58,795 --> 00:54:59,713
[sniffles]

1272
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,550
-You don't resent me?
-No, I don't. Of course, I don't.

1273
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:05,844
-Right. You found someone new.
-Hey, come on.

1274
00:55:05,927 --> 00:55:08,263
[all laughing]

1275
00:55:08,346 --> 00:55:09,180
"Hey, come on."

1276
00:55:10,682 --> 00:55:11,725
I feel the same.

1277
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:16,021
Did you answer?

1278
00:55:17,063 --> 00:55:17,897
Me?

1279
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:19,649
I don't resent her.

1280
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:21,943
I don't.

1281
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:24,070
I don't resent her.

1282
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:30,660
[sighs]

1283
00:55:32,078 --> 00:55:33,079
[music fades]

1284
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:35,206
[Seung-li] I don't really
understand Ji-su.

1285
00:55:36,082 --> 00:55:38,960
She said she was 90% certain,

1286
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:40,879
not 100.

1287
00:55:40,962 --> 00:55:42,630
That made me worried.

1288
00:55:42,714 --> 00:55:43,798
Really worried.

1289
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:45,884
But… I still have hope.

1290
00:55:45,967 --> 00:55:47,510
[slow moody music playing]

1291
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:50,305
So, Seung-li has only ever gone after her,

1292
00:55:50,388 --> 00:55:53,266
-but seems to be getting a little tired.
-Right, right.

1293
00:55:53,349 --> 00:55:54,934
Because Ji-su isn't reassuring.

1294
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:58,354
Right, right. Gosh, what's gonna
happen with them? [sighs]

1295
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:02,067
Okay, so everyone has to stay up.

1296
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:04,069
-[Jae-yun] Okay.
-[Jeong-mok] Gotta keep going.

1297
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:07,739
Are you gonna contact
Ji-su after the show?

1298
00:56:08,364 --> 00:56:09,324
-Me?
-[Ji-yeon] Yeah.

1299
00:56:09,407 --> 00:56:10,533
Shouldn't I, though?

1300
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:13,411
-I mean, that's why we came here.
-[Ji-yeon] You should. You like her.

1301
00:56:14,037 --> 00:56:16,790
[inhales] But honestly, I, uh…
I just don't know.

1302
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:17,707
How she feels?

1303
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:20,627
No, earlier,
she said something about 90%--

1304
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:22,962
-But 90% is basically all there.
-Right.

1305
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:25,965
But I know, if it were me, like,

1306
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:28,843
if I'm even just 1% uncertain,

1307
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:31,096
-I kind of get defensive.
-[Ji-yeon] Yeah.

1308
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:32,472
-Oh.
-I said so earlier.

1309
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:33,556
[Jae-yun] Oh.

1310
00:56:34,849 --> 00:56:37,268
[Seung-li] Yeah, I don't know.
No, I… I don't know yet.

1311
00:56:37,977 --> 00:56:38,937
[Han-na] Gosh.

1312
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:42,398
But this is the last night
before final choice.

1313
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:44,901
I'm so curious
to see what Ji-su will choose.

1314
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:47,195
Because she hasn't really decided yet.

1315
00:56:47,278 --> 00:56:50,156
-And Seung-li is starting to get nervous.
-[In-guk] Yeah. That's hard.

1316
00:56:50,657 --> 00:56:54,410
I think Ji-su will choose Seung-li
or leave the show single.

1317
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:57,372
Exactly. I'm getting kind of nervous.

1318
00:56:58,289 --> 00:56:59,791
Maybe she won't choose anyone.

1319
00:56:59,874 --> 00:57:01,876
-I get that feeling too.
-[Han-na] I'm worried.

1320
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,962
[enthralling music playing]

1321
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:11,928
FINAL SELECTION DAY

1322
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:14,681
[Car] So, the moment has finally come.

1323
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:17,142
-[Han-na] The final choice day!
-[In-guk] Oh, man.

1324
00:57:17,225 --> 00:57:18,143

[Eun-ji] That's what it says
on the last page.

1340
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:41,476
[Han-na] Oh, I see.

1341
00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:43,561
[enchanting music continues]

1342
00:58:54,864 --> 00:58:56,908
[exclaims excitedly]

1343
00:58:56,991 --> 00:58:59,744
I'm imagining the face Ji-yeon will make
when she sees that.

1344
00:58:59,827 --> 00:59:00,662
[Han-na] Mmm.

1351

[Han-na] Yeah.

[door closes]

1353
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:58,052
[Do] I'm sad about how things are ending,
but I have no regrets.

1354
00:59:58,136 --> 01:00:00,346
I had never dated anyone before,

1355
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:03,516
so I had all these fantasies

1356
01:00:04,017 --> 01:00:06,561
But after this experience,

1357
01:00:06,644 --> 01:00:10,565
mmm, I realize I don't feel the need
to date just yet.

1358
01:00:10,648 --> 01:00:12,609
I think I'll leave that door open.

1359
01:00:12,692 --> 01:00:14,527
Yeah, that's what I'll do.

1368
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:51,105
[Yeo-myung] During my time here,

1369
01:00:51,189 --> 01:00:54,734
I learned a lot about
what kind of person I like,

1370
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:59,155
and about what's important to me.

1371
01:01:00,823 --> 01:01:03,117
Well, I was just most attracted to you.

1372
01:01:03,201 --> 01:01:05,036
You're it… for me.

1373
01:01:06,871 --> 01:01:09,499
I didn't think
I'd feel this strongly about someone.

1378
01:01:15,963 --> 01:01:17,965
I still haven't escaped the single life,

1379

but I think I will soon.

good people in real life.

She didn't find a boyfriend,
but she found herself. That's enough.

1383
01:01:28,893 --> 01:01:30,853

[hopeful music playing]

1388
01:02:10,852 --> 01:02:12,729
[Eun-ji] He made a choice.
Jae-yun is so cool.

1389
01:02:12,812 --> 01:02:15,565
-[In-guk] He really is. Good job.
-[Car] Yes, that's right.

1390
01:02:15,648 --> 01:02:17,233
He's gonna try until the end.

1391
01:02:18,025 --> 01:02:19,819
[Jae-yun] I don't expect anything.

1392
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:23,865
I know that Yeo-myung
isn't gonna choose me.

1393
01:02:25,992 --> 01:02:27,618
But it was a good experience.

1394
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:31,622
Most people seemed okay with

1395
01:02:32,832 --> 01:02:35,752
how I speak and how I communicate.

1396
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:41,966
So I gained a lot of confidence
when it comes to talking.

1397
01:02:43,009 --> 01:02:44,343
He does have an oddly funny side.

1398
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:46,429
-He can be funny.
-[Sang-ho] It's kinda addicting.

1399
01:02:46,512 --> 01:02:47,764
It makes it okay.

1400
01:02:47,847 --> 01:02:49,140
Oh, like that! Yes, right!

-The chopstick thing.

-You're doing it?
-Yeah.

1405
01:02:55,396 --> 01:02:58,691
[Jae-yun] I became much more confident
about approaching someone,

1406
01:02:58,775 --> 01:03:00,359
and striking up a conversation.

1407
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:03,696
I often feel that I'm not…

1408
01:03:04,781 --> 01:03:05,948
fully matured yet.

1409
01:03:08,451 --> 01:03:10,620
I couldn't escape the single life,

1410
01:03:12,163 --> 01:03:14,457
but I do feel like I've matured here.

01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:21,088
Wow.

1413
01:03:21,172 --> 01:03:23,633
[Han-na] Wow, he went through
a total transformation.

1414
01:03:23,716 --> 01:03:27,261
Totally. I always joked about him,
saying, "Is he AI?"

1415
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:28,387
Now he's a person.

1416
01:03:28,471 --> 01:03:30,264
-I'm really proud of Jae-yun.
-[Han-na] Yeah.

-[In-guk] Yep.

1423
01:03:54,080 --> 01:03:56,123
[Min-hong] I didn't escape
the single life,

1424
01:03:56,207 --> 01:03:57,834
but I'm very satisfied.

1425
01:03:58,543 --> 01:04:01,420
Even though I didn't find someone here,

1426
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:04,131
I think I'll do better
at dating in real life.

1427
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:07,051
I learned what's important to me.

[Sang-ho] I could tell
she wasn't really interested in me,

1435
01:04:45,965 --> 01:04:49,010
but she's one of the people
I tried my best to impress

Yes, Ji-su will make her own decision.

Regardless, thanks to her,

1454

I felt things here
that I had never felt before.

1455
01:05:50,571 --> 01:05:53,741

1481
01:07:58,574 --> 01:08:00,409
[Ji-su] I've thought about it a lot,

1482
01:08:01,035 --> 01:08:03,746
and I might end up regretting this,

1483
01:08:03,829 --> 01:08:07,374
but I think this is the best decision
I can make right now.

1484

What?

-[music fades]

1486

She said it was
the best decision she could make.

1487

[Eun-ji] Yeah.

1488
01:08:17,218 --> 01:08:18,969
That could mean she put her card in,

1489
01:08:19,887 --> 01:08:22,223
-but it could also mean she abstained.
-Either makes sense.

1490
01:08:22,306 --> 01:08:23,891
-[In-guk] You know…
-[Eun-ji] Yeah.

1491
01:08:23,974 --> 01:08:25,476
…if she were here,

1492
01:08:26,185 --> 01:08:27,520
I'd want to tell her this…

1493
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:32,566
I totally get that she's careful
because this is her first chance at love

1494
01:08:32,650 --> 01:08:35,569
and she has traumatic memories
from when she was young,

1495
01:08:35,653 --> 01:08:37,655
but isn't the process
of getting to know people

1496
01:08:37,738 --> 01:08:39,573
-also important?
-[Eun-ji] Right, very true.

1497
01:08:39,657 --> 01:08:41,450
You know, older people say that a lot.

1498
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:43,536
We should try dating a lot
and meet lots of people

1499
01:08:43,619 --> 01:08:45,412
-before getting married.
-Oh, right, right.

1500
01:08:45,496 --> 01:08:49,667
I think doing that could help her
get up to 100% certainty.

1501
01:08:50,167 --> 01:08:53,379
I don't think there's anyone
who's 100% perfect for you.

They're adorable.

1525
01:10:32,603 --> 01:10:33,646
They're so lovely.

1526
01:10:35,606 --> 01:10:37,358
-[Jeong-mok] Ta-da!
-[Ji-yeon] Ta-da.

1527
01:10:37,441 --> 01:10:38,525
Ta-da.

1528
01:10:39,109 --> 01:10:41,695
-Oh, no. We can't take it back now.
-Yeah, right, we can't.

1529
01:10:41,779 --> 01:10:43,030
-Yeah.
-It's here forever.

1530
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:47,534
-Today is Day 1 for us.
-What do we do? Right.

1531
01:10:51,538 --> 01:10:53,749
Let's just be happy.

1532
01:10:59,296 --> 01:11:00,381
[music fades]

1533
01:11:00,464 --> 01:11:01,715
[sighs wearily]

1534
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:05,177
-Why does he look so tired?
-[Han-na] Seriously.

1535
01:11:08,222 --> 01:11:09,515
[sighs wearily]

1536
01:11:21,944 --> 01:11:23,946
[mellow pensive music playing]

1537
01:11:44,133 --> 01:11:46,427
[Han-na] He's getting anxious
because she's not coming.

1538
01:11:51,974 --> 01:11:53,183
[Eun-ji] Ji-su…

1539
01:11:53,267 --> 01:11:55,352
[In-guk sighs] Why am I so nervous?

1540
01:11:55,436 --> 01:11:57,980
-[Han-na gasps]
-She didn't… I don't think she went.

1541
01:11:58,063 --> 01:11:58,897
[Han-na] Really?

1542
01:11:58,981 --> 01:12:01,984
-[Eun-ji] I don't think so.
-[gasps] Ji-su didn't choose him?

1543
01:12:11,535 --> 01:12:12,494
[music fades]

1544
01:12:13,412 --> 01:12:15,414
[gentle music playing]

1545
01:12:22,629 --> 01:12:23,505
[chuckles softly]

1546
01:12:23,589 --> 01:12:24,798
[music builds up]

1547
01:12:25,632 --> 01:12:26,467
Ji-su.

1548
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:27,926
[enthralling music soaring]

1549
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:28,969
Hi.

1550
01:12:29,053 --> 01:12:29,928
[Seung-li] Hi.

1551
01:12:30,012 --> 01:12:31,305
-[Han-na] She came!
-[screams]

1552
01:12:31,388 --> 01:12:33,140
Wow, that's great.

1553
01:12:33,223 --> 01:12:34,641
-It's our second couple.
-Oh…

1554
01:12:34,725 --> 01:12:36,060
Our second couple.

1555
01:12:36,143 --> 01:12:37,853
-You're so lucky, Seung-li!
-I got chills.

1556
01:12:37,936 --> 01:12:39,480
-[Eun-ji] Do better!
-What was that?

1557
01:12:39,563 --> 01:12:40,981
You really have to get it together.

1558
01:12:41,065 --> 01:12:42,691
-Get it together, you punk!
-Seriously!

1559
01:12:42,775 --> 01:12:44,693
-Listen closely.
-Don't drink too much, man.

1560
01:12:44,777 --> 01:12:47,196
That's right!
Please try harder to read the room.

1561
01:12:48,113 --> 01:12:52,409
As Cupids, we each had one person
who ended up with someone.

1562
01:12:53,035 --> 01:12:54,661
-We did.
-I was Jeong-mok's.

1563
01:12:54,745 --> 01:12:56,038
-I was Ji-su's.
-I was Ji-yeon's.

1564
01:12:56,121 --> 01:12:57,664
-I was Seung-li's.
-That's crazy.

1565
01:12:57,748 --> 01:12:59,792
Oh, but it almost seems like
we planned it.

1566
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:04,713
FINAL SELECTION
JI-SU & SEUNG-LI

1567
01:13:04,797 --> 01:13:06,799
[enchanting music continues]

1568
01:13:06,882 --> 01:13:09,218
[Ji-su] I decided on Seung-li.

1569
01:13:13,722 --> 01:13:15,474
I wish he was more caring,

1570
01:13:16,058 --> 01:13:20,187
but maybe what I really need
is his indifference.

1571
01:13:23,107 --> 01:13:25,526
[Seung-li] There were
so many guys who liked you.

1572
01:13:25,609 --> 01:13:26,819
Was it hard to choose?

1573
01:13:26,902 --> 01:13:28,153
[music fades]

1574
01:13:28,946 --> 01:13:30,697
-No.
-Not at all?

1575
01:13:30,781 --> 01:13:32,074
-No.
-Oh.

1576
01:13:32,157 --> 01:13:33,492
[charming music playing]

1577
01:13:33,575 --> 01:13:34,701
Yeah.

1578
01:13:34,785 --> 01:13:38,497
But I saw that we had the choice
to abstain from voting.

1579
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:39,456
[Ji-su] Yeah.

1580
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:41,750
So when I heard that, I started to worry.

1581
01:13:41,834 --> 01:13:44,670
I thought,
"Oh, she could choose to abstain."

1582
01:13:45,254 --> 01:13:46,922
Was I so unclear?

1583
01:13:47,005 --> 01:13:49,174
No, I was just worrying.

1584
01:13:50,342 --> 01:13:52,177
Maybe 'cause I didn't work out today.

1585
01:13:52,761 --> 01:13:54,596
I think I felt anxious
because I didn't run.

1586
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:55,931
-[chuckles]
-That's just me.

1587
01:13:56,014 --> 01:13:57,141
[both laugh]

1588
01:13:57,224 --> 01:13:58,725
-[Seung-li sighs]
-So…

1589
01:13:58,809 --> 01:13:59,893
[music fades]

1590
01:13:59,977 --> 01:14:02,146
-I read your book in the library.
-Mmm.

1591
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:05,482
[chuckles]

1592
01:14:05,566 --> 01:14:07,734
In the ideal type part…

1593
01:14:07,818 --> 01:14:09,236
-Ideal type?
-Yeah. [chuckles]

1594
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:12,906
You wrote that you liked girls with long,
straight hair and no bangs.

1595
01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:14,700
I did? Bangs.

1596
01:14:14,783 --> 01:14:15,617
[Ji-su laughs]

1597
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:16,869
Ah.

1598
01:14:16,952 --> 01:14:20,247
-I remember reading, "No bangs…
-Straight hair.

1599
01:14:20,330 --> 01:14:22,166
…long, straight hair,

1600
01:14:22,249 --> 01:14:25,836
positive, kind, and doesn't swear."

1601
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:27,379
Aren't you the opposite?

1602
01:14:27,463 --> 01:14:28,464
[laughs]

1603
01:14:28,547 --> 01:14:31,258
Oh, but I think
that's what I realized here.

1604
01:14:31,341 --> 01:14:34,595
I'm actually attracted
to the exact opposite type.

1605
01:14:34,678 --> 01:14:36,180
[upbeat music playing]

1606
01:14:36,263 --> 01:14:37,723
[Ji-su laughs] Ah.

1607
01:14:37,806 --> 01:14:38,849
[inaudible]

1608
01:14:40,350 --> 01:14:42,686
Look, it's all here.
I'm totally different.

1609
01:14:43,312 --> 01:14:46,773
"A girl who looks good
in neat and casual jeans."

1610
01:14:46,857 --> 01:14:48,901
-I was totally off.
-Yeah.

1611
01:14:49,401 --> 01:14:51,570
Even if you regret it,
you can't take it back now.

1612
01:14:51,653 --> 01:14:53,947
[Seung-li] Let's just throw this book
into the lake.

1613
01:14:54,031 --> 01:14:57,117
Oh, I'm gonna take it home.
I'll tease you about it forever.

1614
01:14:58,869 --> 01:15:01,497
[Seung-li] My first impression pick
was Ji-su.

1615
01:15:03,081 --> 01:15:04,291
-Are you…
-Yeah.

1616
01:15:04,374 --> 01:15:05,459
Oh, right, right.

1617
01:15:05,542 --> 01:15:07,127
[Seung-li] It was always Ji-su.

1618
01:15:07,211 --> 01:15:08,962
[inaudible]

1619
01:15:09,046 --> 01:15:10,881
She'll be my first girlfriend.

1620
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:16,178
[Ji-su] I can imagine myself
getting frustrated with him. [chuckles]

1621
01:15:16,261 --> 01:15:17,513
But I also think that

1622
01:15:17,596 --> 01:15:19,890
when I get irritated,
Seung-li can take it.

1623
01:15:21,433 --> 01:15:23,519
[Seung-li] Aren't I good
at remembering things today?

1624
01:15:23,602 --> 01:15:25,979
-I think I did well.
-[Ji-su] Let's talk about that later.

1625
01:15:26,063 --> 01:15:28,190
[Seung-li] After the show.
You keep saying that.

1626
01:15:28,273 --> 01:15:29,858
We're already done, you know.

1627
01:15:29,942 --> 01:15:30,943
[Ji-su laughs]

1628
01:15:31,568 --> 01:15:33,570
-[inaudible]
-[upbeat music continues]

1629
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:37,783
[Jeong-mok] Because I was single
for such a long time,

1630
01:15:38,408 --> 01:15:39,826
I was worried that I had a problem,

1631
01:15:40,786 --> 01:15:42,329
that I wasn't attractive.

1632
01:15:42,412 --> 01:15:44,081
My self-esteem was dropping.

1633
01:15:44,164 --> 01:15:47,042
I kept thinking, "Am I that unlovable?"

1634
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:49,044
I was worried about that.

1635
01:15:49,920 --> 01:15:51,004
Being here,

1636
01:15:52,339 --> 01:15:53,549
I learned,

1637
01:15:54,174 --> 01:15:55,884
"Oh, I can be loved too."

1638
01:15:55,968 --> 01:15:57,636
"I can give someone love."

1639
01:15:57,719 --> 01:16:00,430
I feel certain of that now
and that feels great.

1640
01:16:00,514 --> 01:16:04,017
And I want to continue this relationship
even after the show.

1641
01:16:04,893 --> 01:16:07,437
Jeong-mok kept talking to me
about marriage.

1642
01:16:07,521 --> 01:16:10,023
Like, "Oh, we need to get married."

1643
01:16:10,107 --> 01:16:12,818
And… I think we might
actually do it. [chuckles]

1644
01:16:12,901 --> 01:16:14,611
I know it sounds crazy, but…

1645
01:16:16,363 --> 01:16:18,198
I think we will. [chuckles]

1646
01:16:20,450 --> 01:16:22,452
[upbeat Korean song playing]

1647
01:16:42,055 --> 01:16:43,849
