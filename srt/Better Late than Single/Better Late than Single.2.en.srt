PLEASE CHECK YOUR MAILBOXES OUT FRONT
TODAY'S DATING NEWSLETTER IS HERE

00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:18,268
It says to open the mailbox.

5
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:20,437
[Ji-yeon] No way! Quick, get over here.

6
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:22,689
-[Do] Why?
-It says to look in the mailbox.

7
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:24,607
There's a Dating Newsletter inside.

8
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,609
-[Do] Really? Just a sec.
-Hurry, let's go look!

9
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:29,946
[Do] The mailbox?
That red thing we saw outside?

10
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:32,449
[Han-na] Wait? What's a Dating Newsletter?

11
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:33,908
[Eun-ji] What is it?

12
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:38,121
-[Do gasps] What's that?
-We got something. We each got a letter.

13
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:40,165
-What is it?
-[Ji-yeon] I'm gonna read it inside.

14
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:42,250
[Do] Okay, yeah, let's go. [exclaims]

18
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:50,216
Who was your Cupid?

19
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,217
Um, it was Eun-ji.

20
00:00:51,301 --> 00:00:53,219
-Right, we both had her.
-She was my mentor too.

21
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:54,512
[gasps] Oh!

22
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:56,347
Ah.

23
00:00:57,265 --> 00:01:01,227
Mine says, "Do, please remember
to be a good listener,

24
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:04,647
and remember to show off
your bright and bubbly charm."

00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:07,525
This is kind of touching.

27
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:08,777
-I know, right?
-Yeah.

28
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,320
-Hey, you're here.
-You saw it?

29
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:13,907
-You look in the mailbox yet?
-Yeah, I brought it in. What did it say?

30
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,408
Car, the garden wrote to me.

31
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:18,036
He says,
"You did a great job with your diet."

32
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:20,413
"Keep doing your best."
Something like that.

33
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:22,582
I HOPE YOU FIND A FUN DATE

34
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:24,959
PS: DON'T THINK OF YOUR DISLIKES ABOUT HIM

35
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:26,294
This is so touching.

36
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:28,338
[Jae-yun] I read it several times.

37
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,590
DON'T BE AFRAID TO TALK
YOU'RE TOO CHARMING TO BE QUIET

38
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:31,883
It gave me a confidence boost.

39
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:33,301
DON'T OVERTHINK
DISPLAY YOUR CHARM

40
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:36,805
-[Han-na] You put so much in that letter.
-[Car] Yeah, you did.

41
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:39,307
Like you were writing
to a son who's in the army.

42
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,768
-I had so much to say.
-[Eun-ji] Right, right.

43
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:43,770
I wanted to help guide them, you know?

44
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:46,689
[chuckling] This is so cute.

45
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:50,193
"Entrance pass to the 5 Minute Library."

46
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,945
-What? I didn't get that.
-Really?

47
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:53,279
[gasps] Whoa!

48
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:54,781
-[Car] "5 Minute Library?"
-Huh?

00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:58,576
TICKET TO THE 5 MINUTE LIBRARY
YOU WILL BE NOTIFIED OF TIME AND LOCATION

50
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,995
-Library?
-[Car] What's that?

51
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:02,539
-[Eun-ji] Only Ji-su got that.
-What?

52
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,249
-[Han-na] Must be…
-[Eun-ji] Oh.

53
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,584
Did I get one too?

54
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:07,919
[exclaims] No, I didn't.

55
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:08,837
What?

56
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,421
[whimsical music playing]

57
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:11,339
[both] Oh.

58
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:14,384
"Library pass."

59
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:15,969
Hey, that sounds fun though.

60
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:18,263

-Hmm.

75
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:14,027
"Congrats, you were the top
first impression pick."

76
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:18,698
Wow. "As a reward, you've been given
an entrance pass to the 5 Minute Library."

77
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:22,410
"Here, you can read the diary
of someone you're curious about."

78
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:25,038
"But you can only stay for five minutes."

79
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:28,458
"When the time is up, please put
the diary back and exit the room."

80
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,753
I got many votes
for the first impression pick,

81
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:34,714
so I've been granted this opportunity.

82
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:38,801
-[gasps] Ah, so there was a reward. I see.
-Now she knows she was top pick.

83
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:42,680
If you choose carefully,
you can maybe get a better sense

84
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:45,016
-of the person you like, right?
-[Eun-ji] Yeah, you can.

85
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:47,060
That way, you can figure out how to send

86
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:49,062
-a clear signal to someone.
-[Car] Right.

87
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:50,772
I wonder what it says.

[mellow music playing]

89
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:54,108
Am I allowed to take notes?

90
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,819
I think I might forget.

91
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,865
First of all, this is Sang-ho's diary.

92
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:03,493
Of course. He's her top choice, for sure.

93
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,912
[Ji-su] I decided to read
from Sang-ho's diary.

94
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:08,373
As I said
during the first impression pick,

95
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:11,626
Sang-ho is my ideal type
in terms of looks.

96
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:14,087
I don't think I'll remember
what I read though.

97
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:17,757
[gasps] "Floral scent."

98
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,717
[groans] I didn't bring any perfume.

99
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:20,927
I felt rushed,

100
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:24,597
I was trying to read everything quickly,
so I just skimmed through it.

101
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:27,392
-[gripping music playing]
-"Kimchi fried rice."

102
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:29,269
Street food is awesome, I agree.

103
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:32,105
Tteokbokki is amazing.
Okay, so he likes carbs.

104
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:34,065
"Mango juice"?

105
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:36,985
He's had three crushes before?

106
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:39,529
Oh, but he never told them how he felt.

107
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:40,780
[breathes deeply]

108
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:45,034
-[Han-na] Time is going by so fast.
-[Car] There's a time crunch.

109
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,953
-She has to read quickly.
-[In-guk] Right.

110
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:48,955
"Someone who's responsible."

111
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:50,206
That's me.

112
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,918
Sorry, that's ridiculous.
How narcissistic of me.

113
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:56,504
Hmm.

[groans]

117
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:10,727
It's too cruel. Five minutes is so short.
I should get at least ten.

118
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,103
[Eun-ji] Give her more time.

119
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:15,148
By the way,
I really want to commend Ji-su for this.

120
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:17,317
From the first impression pick until now,

121
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,528
reading the diary,
she keeps considering how she measures up.

122
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:23,740
-"How do I relate to this?"
-Like, "Oh, tteokbokki is amazing."

123
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,491
"Street food is great. Hey, this is me,

124
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,660
-someone with responsibility."
-[Han-na] That's good.

125
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:29,579
-I love seeing that.
-[Eun-ji] So cute.

126
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,456
-I'm rooting for her.
-[Han-na] Right.

127
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,624
[Eun-ji] Next up, it's Jae-yun.

128
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,418
[In-guk] Oh, Jae-yun.

129
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,880
[whimsical music playing]

130
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:47,013
[Jae-yun] I got the most votes
in the first impression pick, so…

131
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:47,930
[sucks teeth]

132
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,683
…I definitely felt some pressure, like,

133
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,685
"I don't really deserve to win this."

134
00:05:53,394 --> 00:05:55,271
I was kinda nervous but also excited.

135
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:56,981
You only have five minutes.

136
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:59,484
-[Eun-ji] Whose diary will Jae-yun read?
-Who's it gonna be?

137
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:01,652
[music fades]

138
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,864
[mumbles]

139
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,703
[Jae-yun] I decided to read
Kim Yeo-myung's diary.

140
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,121
[mellow music playing]

141
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:15,708
-Oh, he picked Yeo-myung.
-He's definitely had a change of heart.

142
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,711
The conversation from the day before
must've had an impact.

143
00:06:18,795 --> 00:06:20,755
[Eun-ji] It must've had a strong impact.

144
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:24,884
[Jae-yun] The way she smiles
is so bright and cheerful.

145
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:25,802
[laughs]

146
00:06:25,885 --> 00:06:27,095
[indistinct chatter]

147
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:29,639
[Jae-yun] It made me want
to know more about her.

148
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:31,766
[Yeo-myung chuckles]

149
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:36,187
[Jae-yun] I read slowly
from the very beginning.

150
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,147
[music fades]

151
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,779
-A notepad? Is he taking notes?
-[In-guk] What?

152
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:46,614
[mellow music playing]

153
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:48,699
[Jae-yun] A movie she especially liked.

154
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:52,161
Okay, she put
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.

155
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,496
I liked that one too.

156
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:54,413
ETERNAL SUNSHINE

157
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:56,582
So, that response stuck with me the most.

158
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,584
THIS IS WHAT REAL LOVE MUST BE LIKE

159
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:00,795
[alarm ringing]

160
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:05,049
[music ends]

161
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:09,345
Five minutes was shorter than I'd thought.

162
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:12,598
I should've sped through it
like I was taking a test.

163
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:16,894
It's as if I focused too much
on the first five questions

164
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:19,647
and ended up missing the next 20.

165
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:22,358
I should've read the back too.

166
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:24,902
[Ji-su] It's Min-hong!

167
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:26,863
[Ji-su laughs]

168
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,781
Let's go hang outside.

169
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,616
-[Min-hong] Can we go?
-[Yeo-myung] We can?

170
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,493
[Ji-su] Are we allowed? Just here to hang.

171
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:33,494
[Min-hong] Don't know.

172
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:35,872
-[Yeo-myung] Why does it smell so nice?
-Smell something?

173
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,874
-It smells so nice.
-[Ji-su] You look so proud.

174
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,041
-Come here.
-Hello.

175
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,586
-[Ji-su] So proud of herself.
-[Yeo-myung] What are you up to?

176
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,129
[Yeo-myung] Hey, just a sec.

177
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:44,338
Wait, what's he doing?

178
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:46,549
-He's malfunctioning. Hang on.
-Oh, my God!

179
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:49,010
[Car] What's he doing?
What's going on with him?

180
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:51,095
[amusing music playing]

181
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,474
Jae-yun, don't run away!

182
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:57,059
[Han-na] No, you have to talk to them.
Don't leave.

183
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,811
[Eun-ji and Car laughing]

184
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:01,397
Yeo-myung's right there. What's he doing?

185
00:08:03,065 --> 00:08:03,900
[music ends]

186
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,776
-What is it?
-[Jae-yun] Oh. Shit.

187
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,736
[door closes]

188
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:07,945
What?

189
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,155
You startled me.

190
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:10,072
You okay?

191
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:11,782
No, I…

192
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:17,163
The women are still
hanging around outside.

193
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:19,916
Doesn't it seem like
Jae-yun is back to his old self?

194
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:21,292
He's regressing a little.

195
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,585
I have a bad feeling.

196
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:25,129
-His hair seems to have grown out too.
-[Eun-ji] Yeah.

197
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:29,300
No, but Jae-yun is the kind of guy
who does well when he has time to prepare,

198
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:33,721
but something so sudden must've taken him
by surprise and thrown him off.

199
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:36,098
Car, the garden,
what would you do in that situation?

200
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,266
"Morning."

201
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,893
[Eun-ji laughs]

202
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:40,937
-How you doing?
-[Eun-ji] That's what you'd say?

203
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,647
-"Morning." Tip your hat?
-[Car] Yes.

204
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:46,192
You have to say something.
Yeo-myung asked him, "What are you up to?"

205
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:48,444
He should've answered, but he didn't even…

206
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,821
I hope Yeo-myung
doesn't get the wrong idea.

207
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:53,324
-Oh, he did so well on the first day.
-Yeah.

208
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:55,368
-But today, he's still…
-[Eun-ji laughs]

209
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:56,285
[splutters]

210
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,705
-[Han-na] Yeah, he's retreating. Yeah.
-Even I'm starting to malfunction. Crazy!

211
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:02,833
-[Han-na] Hang on.
-[Car] Right, this is… Jeez.

212
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,669
How will they decide?

213
00:09:04,752 --> 00:09:06,879
They'll explain it, right?
Or is it random?

214
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,089
-[cell phone chimes]
-What?

215
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:09,215
BREAKFAST IS IN THE LOUNGE

216
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:10,132
A meal?

217
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,717
PLEASE PICK A DRINK BEFORE EATING

218
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:13,719
-Really?
-The dates must be based on the drinks.

219
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:14,637
Let's go.

220
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,389
-Hurry, hurry.
-Let's head over.

221
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:17,974
Let's get first dibs today.

222
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,141
[Do] Okay.

223
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,519
-[exciting music playing]
-[both chuckling]

224
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:22,770
[Do] If we're having a meal,

225
00:09:22,853 --> 00:09:25,565
I should've changed out of my pajamas.
I'm embarrassed.

226
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,817
-[Ji-yeon] It says something.
-What's it say?

227
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:30,403
On the drinks.
You're right, it must be the drinks.

228
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:33,739
-"Men" and "women"?
-[Do] But shouldn't we keep it a secret?

229
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,533
[Ji-yeon] Hello!

230
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:36,867
Hi, guys.

231
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:38,828
Hello, hello.

232
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,371
-Hey.
-[Do] What is this?

233
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:42,290
-So, there are matching ones.
-Who?

234
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:44,166
-Oh, I see. Sounds fun.
-[Hyun-kyu] So then…

235
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,628
-Hello. Hi, everyone.
-[Min-hong] It's first come, first serve.

236
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:48,546
Hurry up.

237
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:49,505
[Jeong-mok] Oh.

238
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,173
Are we last?

239
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:55,469
-Wanna try?
-[Ji-yeon] I don't know what it is.

240
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:58,514
-I'll choose this. Doesn't look too sweet.
-[Sang-ho] They made this?

241
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,350
-Did they? I want an unsweetened drink.
-Pick one.

242
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:02,393
[Min-hong] Oh, but…

243
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:07,565
[Do] Actually, I did think that the dates
would be based on which drinks we chose.

244
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:10,067
So, to be strategic,

245
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:13,821
I should choose
after I see who picks which drink.

246
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:16,198
But then, I thought,

247
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,283
"I'll pick first,"

248
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:21,370
since I got there first. [chuckles]

249
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:25,583
So, I chose tea thinking,
"Tea seems like the best move."

250
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:29,253
Especially since I want to go
on a one-on-one date.

251
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,547
[whimsical music playing]

252
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,174
I'll go with this one.

253
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:37,803
I thought this might be
what our dates are based on,

254
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:41,932
but I just chose coffee because
that's what I really wanted to drink.

255
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:45,019
-[Ji-su] I mean, seriously…
-It's bitter. It's really bitter.

256
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:46,479
[Ji-yeon] I picked mine.

257
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:47,938
-I'll go with…
-What is that?

258
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:50,775
-Isn't it coffee?
-Okay, I'm gonna choose coffee.

259
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:52,693
-It's not Coke, is it?
-I choose coffee.

260
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,779
[Yeo-myung] I don't know
if it's Coke or coffee.

261
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:57,281
-[Do] I see bubbles, though.
-I'll choose coffee.

262
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,408
[whimsical music playing]

263
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:03,913
[Ji-yeon] I figured we'd go on dates
with the people who chose the same drinks,

264
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:07,041
so I said,
"I should drink some coffee today."

265
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:11,253
I was hoping Jae-yun would overhear me

266
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,880
and then pick coffee.

267
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,425
What's that? [sniffles]

268
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,676
-I…
-What?

269
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:21,597
[Ji-su] They told us to choose,
so I thought, "Be smart about this."

270
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,141
I remember reading that
Sang-ho liked mango juice.

271
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:25,226
[Car] What?

272
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:26,727
"Mango juice"?

273
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:28,562
Q. YOUR FAVORITE DRINK?
I LOVE MANGO JUICE

274
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,856
I picked it thinking, "Please be mango."

275
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,901
-There you go. Nice!
-[Han-na] What?

276
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:35,903
Getting that time in the 5 Minute Library

277
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:37,488
-was a big advantage.
-[In-guk] Right.

278
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:39,907
Sang-ho, don't you dare choose coffee now.

279
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,075
[laughs]

280
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:44,245
Don't be like, "I'm gonna drink coffee
since it's morning,".

281
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:45,413
[Eun-ji] He's not thinking.

282
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:48,624
-[Car] Don't you dare drink the coffee.
-I think he might pick it.

283
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:50,292
[indistinct chatter]

284
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:54,171
What is this? Is it orange juice?

285
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:56,549
But it didn't taste like mango, so…

286
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,217
-A cocktail?
-[Ji-su] The ice melted.

287
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,927
-I can't tell what flavor it is.
-No, no.

288
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,720
I mean, it's not orange.

289
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:02,847
What's the flavor?

290
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,057
Kind of like mango?

291
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,142
[Yeo-myung] Mango?

292
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,436
Oh, it would be nice if it was mango.

293
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,438
[soft whimsical music playing]

294
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:11,939
No, whoever came first.

295
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:13,899
Whoever came first gets first choice.

296
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,401
[Seung-li] You can pick.

297
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,529
I'm wondering
whether to have tea or coffee.

298
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,490
[Sang-ho] Have coffee if you're tired.

299
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,952
[Jeong-mok] Actually,
as soon as I got there,

300
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:27,246
I saw the different drinks and thought,

301
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:31,083
"We're gonna get paired up
with the person who chose the same drink."

302
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:34,420
I saw Do had chosen tea,
so I thought I'd choose tea too, but…

303
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:36,505
Okay then, I'll go with tea.

304
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,258
-[Seung-li] Tea?
-[Hyun-kyu] I pick tea.

305
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:40,843
[Eun-ji and In-guk exclaim]

306
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:43,762
[Jeong-mok] But Hyun-kyu went first
and chose tea.

307
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:44,763
[chuckles]

308
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,849
So I guess I failed at that.

309
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,560
By the way, what is this?

310
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:51,896
Is it orange?
I don't know what kind of juice it is.

311
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:53,856
-I'll choose juice.
-Orange juice.

312
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:54,773
[Han-na] What?

313
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:55,941
Huh? What did Sang-ho…

314
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,818
-Take it. That's it.
-[Han-na] What?

315
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,945
-[Eun-ji] Nice!
-[In-guk] Ji-su keeps watching.

316
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:01,572
-[Eun-ji] Excellent job.
-Okay.

317
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:03,199
[indistinct chatter]

318
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:06,327
[Jeong-mok sighs] Okay. Is this Coke?

319
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:09,705
-I don't know what…
-Well, you picked it, so I have no choice.

320
00:13:11,207 --> 00:13:12,208
Okay.

321
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:17,171
[Seung-li] Kang Ji-su
had chosen orange juice,

322
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:19,965
so I was going to choose that one too.

323
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,675
But then Sang-ho took it.

324
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:24,929
At that moment, I realized,

325
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:27,848
"He must have the same plan as me."

326
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:29,683
"I've got competition now."

327
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:31,602
That's all I was thinking.

328
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,606
-[Sang-ho] Juice.
-[Seung-li] You picked it, I've no choice.

329
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:36,982
[Jeong-mok] Okay.

330
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,151
Competition, huh?

331
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:41,070
It's getting real. The competition begins.

332
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,571
-It's getting heated.
-Right.

333
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,365
-Oh.
-[gripping rock music playing]

334
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:46,283
DID YOU SEE WHAT THE WOMEN PICKED?

335
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,536
So, I didn't exactly look at anyone.

336
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50,454
I was kind of tired and out of it.

337
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:53,457
I was thirsty,
and I like tangerine juice, so, yeah.

338
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,709
I had to pick something,
so I just picked that one.

339
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:58,546
I knew he'd be like that.
He said he was thirsty.

340
00:13:58,629 --> 00:14:00,005
He picked because he was thirsty.

341
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,132
-[Han-na] Goodness. This guy.
-[laughing]

342
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:04,301
-[Car] He's on vacation.
-[Han-na] "On vacation."

343
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:07,388
-But Sang-ho is really lucky.
-[Han-na] Oh, for sure.

344
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:08,556
-Yeah, you're right.
-Yeah.

345
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,391
-Dumb luck, you know?
-[Eun-ji] He's lucky.

346
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:12,226
He didn't think
too much before he chose it,

347
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:14,812
but he got matched with Ji-su,
the most popular girl.

348
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:17,398
-He'll switch with anyone if they ask.
-[Eun-ji] He might.

349
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:19,149
-Like, "You wanna drink this?"
-I know.

350
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,652
[Jeong-mok] I think
this one's Coke. Coffee?

351
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:23,654
-What is this one?
-It's open.

352
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:24,697
Wait, is this…

353
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,574
[indistinct chatter]

354
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:30,870
-[Do] Let's mix it up. Change seats.
-[Min-hong] That sounds good.

355
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,746
-Bon appétit.
-[Yeo-myung] Bon appétit!

356
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:35,124
-[Ji-su] Eat up.
-[Seung-li and Sang-ho] Bon appétit.

357
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,209
-When did you get here?
-[Min-hong] When I woke up.

358
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,377
8:50, I think?

359
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,378
[Sang-ho] At 8:00.

360
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:41,255
[pleasant music playing]

361
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:43,048
-[Yeo-myung] We saw each other.
-Oh, yeah.

362
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:45,342
I had no makeup on.

363
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:50,764
-Well, you looked okay.
-[Ji-yeon] Really?

364
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:53,058
[chuckles]

365
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,103
-He said it in front of Yeo-myung.
-What?

366
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:57,605
-Nice move.
-She heard him.

367
00:14:57,688 --> 00:15:00,399
Why does he flirt
like he's recording ASMR?

368
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:02,276
-[Han-na] Is he talking to himself?
-Exactly.

369
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:04,987
-That's him trying to work up the courage.
-[Han-na] Right.

370
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,907
I'm sure he made
a snap decision to say that out loud.

371
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,909
[Car] To tell her she looks good
without makeup.

372
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,785
[Han-na] Like, "I gotta tell her this."

373
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:13,621
-[cell phone chimes]
-[Do] Oh.

374
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:16,332
IN A FEW MOMENTS,
THE FIRST DATES WILL BEGIN

375
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:18,792
[Hyun-kyu] Oh, we're paired by drinks.

376
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:20,336
A-ha.

377
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:21,629
GREEN TEA
HYUN-KYU, YI DO

378
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:23,380
-Yeah. We…
-And we both have tea.

379
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:26,383
-[Car] Oh, he's sad.
-[Han-na] He is.

380
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,469
[mellow music playing]

381
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:32,806
[Do] I should've been
more thoughtful when picking my drink.

382
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,934
I regret that a little bit.

383
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:41,273
I'm more interested in Seung-li
and Jeong-mok than I am in Hyun-kyu.

384
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:45,486
JUICE
SANG-HO, JI-SU

385
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:48,614
[Ji-su] I'm looking forward
to my date with Sang-ho.

386
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:52,159
-[Min-hong] The drop tower.
-[Yeo-myung] The coffees go together.

387
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:54,870
COFFEE: SEUNG-LI, JAE-YUN, JEONG-MOK
MIN-HONG, YEO-MYUNG, JI-YEON

388
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:56,288
[Yeo-myung] Ah.

389
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,583
[Jae-yun] I picked iced Americano,
like Yeo-myung.

390
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,419
I'm happy with how things turned out.

391
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:04,088
[Car] Oh, nice.

392
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:08,759
I've been thinking,
"I'd like to get to know

393
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:11,387
Jae-yun and Jeong-mok better."

394
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:15,516
So, I'm happy that we were all
gonna go on a date together.

395
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:19,979
Even though they're eternal singles
with no experience,

396
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,313
they catch on quickly.

397
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:23,816
They knew that drinks
would determine their dates.

398
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,359
But I feel like the guys

399
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:28,320
-could be a bit more forward about things.
-Right?

400
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:30,990
-[In-guk] It feels like that.
-I'm so frustrated.

401
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:33,951
-As soon as they saw the table, they knew.
-[Eun-ji] That's what I mean.

402
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:35,327
They should've just said,

403
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,329
-"Oh, I'm gonna drink this."
-[Han-na] Exactly.

404
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:38,497
[Eun-ji] Seriously.

405
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,082
Well, I really like Sang-ho.

406
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:44,044
Because he's just the kind of person
that I like to see on a dating show.

407
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:46,588
-[Eun-ji] Your fave.
-They're so considerate about everything.

408
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:47,798
[Eun-ji] Right, right.

409
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:49,925
-Sang-ho's like…
-No need to be that considerate.

410
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,719
"Oh, will they give us
something to drink?"

411
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:54,054
-"Oh. Hey, it's tangerine juice."
-[Eun-ji] I'm thirsty.

412
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:57,099
Then he gulps it down. And yesterday too.
"It's hot. Is there a fan?"

413
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,350
"Oh, it's a fan."

414
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,352
Sang-ho is putting himself

415
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:03,772
-and his own comfort before the women.
-[Eun-ji] Exactly. He is.

416
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,107
I totally love this guy.

417
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,609
-He's gotten lucky up till now.
-Right.

418
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,654
-But I think he'll try harder from now on.
-Yeah, I hope so.

419
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:11,655
PARK JI-YEON
YI DO

420
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:12,740
[Ji-yeon] So…

421
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:14,616
TALKING IN THE BATHROOM

422
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,745
I was in the middle, and I kept saying,
"I don't know where to look."

423
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:19,204
"Where should I look?"

424
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:22,416
And maybe I misheard,
but I think he said, "At me."

425
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:24,209
[Do] No, I heard it too. I heard that.

426
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:25,878
What?

427
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:26,920
Oh.

428
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:27,880
[Han-na] What?

429
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:29,423
-[Eun-ji] Huh?
-[Car] What happened?

430
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:30,340
EARLIER

431
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:31,884
Does everyone usually eat breakfast?

432
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:32,843
JAE-YUN
JI-YEON

433
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:34,636
We're so awkwardly seated.

434
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:36,764
[Ji-su] Are we?

435
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:38,557
I had no makeup on.

436
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,185
I don't know where I should be looking.

437
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:42,644
Not at all.

438
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,688
-You didn't look like you were.
-[Ji-yeon] Really?

439
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,982
I don't know where I should be looking.

440
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:49,068
"AT ME"

441
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:49,985
Really?

442
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,780
HEARD "NOT AT ALL" AS "AT ME"
SHE WAS COMPLETELY MISTAKEN

443
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:54,156
Oh, "Not at all."

444
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:56,450
-She must've misheard… [laughs]
-He said, "Not at all."

445
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,368
But she heard, "At me."

446
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,330
-Oh, Ji-yeon…
-A misunderstanding, I think.

447
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,082
He said it too softly.

448
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:04,374
[Eun-ji] Exactly.

449
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,251
[Han-na] He should've said it louder.

450
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,504
And Do is agreeing with her.

451
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:11,256
-[In-guk] What the fuck? My God.
-Oh, no. She's totally mistaken.

452
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,174
What do we do?

453
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:14,635
Yeah, the thing is, Jae-yun actually went,

454
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:17,304
"Not at all…" But to Ji-yeon,

455
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:19,598
-it must've looked like, "At me."
-[Han-na] So close.

456
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:20,849
[Car] Right.

457
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:21,934
-Okay.
-[In-guk] "At me."

458
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:23,644
-[Han-na] With a long gaze.
-Right.

459
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:25,687
-"At me. Look at me."
-[Eun-ji gasps]

460
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,232
-[Eun-ji] Her heart must've been racing.
-Oh, no.

461
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:32,277
-[upbeat music playing]
-[sighs] What outfit would fit my hair?

462
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:33,237
Oh, I got it.

463
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:35,239
Pink.

464
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:38,200
WHAT KIND OF FIRST DATE
DO YOU WANT TO HAVE IN JEJU?

465
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:41,745
I'm looking forward to
sitting in a cute cafe,

466
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,497
doing fun stuff together,

467
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,499
and gazing out at nature.

468
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:51,171
Wow, his style has improved a lot.

469
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:54,341
[Hyun-kyu] I'm totally excited
about my first date.

470
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,887
I gotta stay relaxed and not get nervous.

471
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:02,891
Until now, we've been talking in groups.

472
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,477
I think I'll really be nervous
talking one-on-one.

473
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:12,192
[knocks on door]

474
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:14,153
-Can I ask a favor?
-[Min-hong] Sure.

475
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:16,655
-Can I borrow some earrings?
-Yeah, come here.

476
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:18,782
These are quite proper.

477
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:21,743
Or I have these,
but maybe they're too simple.

478
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,912
Have fun. See you later tonight.

479
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:28,083
WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO TELL
YOUR FIRST DATE?

480
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,126
My first date?

481
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:32,379
I don't really know what I'm doing,
I might be totally clueless.

482
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,549
But I hope we can have
a little fun. [chuckles]

483
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:37,843
[upbeat Korean song playing]

484
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:43,724
TODAY'S WEATHER IS 30°C
IT'S SUPER HOT!

485
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:45,726
ONE-ON-ONE DATE
SANG-HO & JI-SU

486
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:47,186
[Sang-ho in English] Hello.

487
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:48,770
Hey. How are you?

488
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:51,315
[seat belt clicking]

489
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:54,693
I don't know how long we'll be out.

490
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:56,778
Will you be okay without a jacket?

491
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,238
-A jacket?
-Yeah.

492
00:19:58,322 --> 00:19:59,156
For now.

493
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:00,699
[Ji-su] Yeah, you're right.

494
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:03,744
I didn't know the weather
would cool down so much,

495
00:20:03,827 --> 00:20:05,871
so I only brought light clothes.

496
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:15,547
[Ji-su] I wore a blue blouse
because he said he liked blue.

497
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:16,924
[whimsical music playing]

498
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,592
-Got your seatbelt on?
-Yeah.

499
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:23,347
[Ji-su] But I don't think he noticed.

500
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:28,560
[exclaims]

501
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:31,021
Ji-su put thought
into the color of her blouse.

502
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:33,607
Ji-su is so good at utilizing
everything she's got.

503
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,234
Exactly. She uses what she has

504
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:38,779
and remembers everything
she learned in the 5 Minute Library.

505
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:41,240
-[Sang-ho] Shall we go?
-[Ji-su] Okay.

506
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,325
[upbeat music playing]

507
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:48,872
-[Sang-ho] This is my first electric car.
-[Ji-su] Oh.

508
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,707
[Sang-ho] I'll try to drive safely.

509
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:58,715
-[chuckling] Can I go slowly?
-Yeah, sure.

510
00:20:58,799 --> 00:20:59,967
[music fades]

511
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,220
Uh, if you could help me with the GPS…

512
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:05,764
-The GPS? Yes, I'm keeping an eye on it.
-Okay.

513
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:07,391
-You can go straight.
-Got it.

514
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:10,602
It's straight ahead for a while,
so you can just keep going.

515
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:11,979
About 60 km?

516
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:12,896
Yes.

517
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:17,109
Oh, you have insurance, right?

518
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:18,443
[quirky music playing]

519
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,195
I'm sure they handle that for us.

520
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,030
No, I mean, life insurance.

521
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:24,950
[Han-na] "Life insurance."

522
00:21:26,243 --> 00:21:27,911
-It's a joke.
-[In-guk] Oh, Ji-su!

523
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:30,455
-If it's a joke, he should laugh.
-[In-guk] He tried to laugh.

524
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,582
[Eun-ji] Yeah, he's playing along.

525
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,876
[Sang-ho] I did practice
driving before this,

526
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,421
but I was nervous
because it was a different kind of car.

527
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:39,423
It was tricky for several reasons.

528
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,134
[Ji-su] Mm.

529
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:45,679
Earlier, when we were having the drinks…
When did you pick your drink?

530
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,056
I was the very last one to pick.

531
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,809
The tangerine juice wasn't so popular.

532
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:51,810
[Ji-su] Tangerine?

533
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:54,021
Oh, well…

534
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,606
-So…
-Hmm.

535
00:21:56,690 --> 00:21:59,693
-I want to let you focus on driving, so I…
-Oh, okay.

536
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:01,737
I wasn't sure if I should say this.

537
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:06,908
But I put you
for my first impression pick.

538
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:07,826
Oh, really?

539
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:08,994
I picked you.

540
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:10,120
Oh, really?

541
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:11,121
[gasps]

542
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:12,497
[Han-na] Hey, Ji-su.

543
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:14,166
-[In-guk] Time out!
-[Car] He'll crash.

544
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:16,001
-Good job.
-[Eun-ji] Told right away.

545
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:17,669
She's gonna cause an accident.

546
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:20,422
-Exactly. Is Sang-ho okay?
-God, right away like that?

547
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,257
[Car] He looked totally surprised.

548
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,343
-He must be shocked.
-She's so straightforward.

549
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:27,429
But Ji-su did tell me before
that if she liked someone,

550
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:28,930
she'd let him know, and she did.

551
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,766
-[Eun-ji] So upfront.
-So straightforward.

552
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:33,685
But I put you
for my first impression pick.

553
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,062
Oh, really?

554
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:39,066
So even before I went,
I was thinking things over in my room,

555
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:42,360
I was like,
"Oh, if we pick the same juice,

556
00:22:42,444 --> 00:22:44,446
we'll definitely go together."

557
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:47,574
Since you said you liked mango juice…

558
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:51,578
I was hoping it was mango juice,
but it didn't really taste like mango.

559
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:53,705
So I was trying to say
it was a tropical fruit,

560
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,916
and it turned out to be tangerine juice.

561
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:57,667
Yeah, tangerine.

562
00:23:01,505 --> 00:23:03,882
-[Han-na] What?
-[Eun-ji] Sang-ho. Please react!

563
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:05,675
-This way?
-[Ji-su] Yeah.

564
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:07,511
-It's confusing.
-[Car] What?

565
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:09,888
-What are you doing? Answer her!
-[Han-na] This isn't it!

566
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:10,806
[Eun-ji] Come on.

567
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:13,558
-[Han-na] She chose you. Say you like her.
-Sang-ho's reaction was…

568
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:14,976
-I know.
-[Car] He won't look.

569
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,853
Did you teach him anything at all?

570
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:18,105
-Oh, you're right.
-Huh?

571
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:19,898
I didn't know he'd have to drive.

572
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:23,443
What you should've done is sent him
to a driving school or something!

573
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:26,113
Well, his thoughts
are all jumbled up right now.

574
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:28,365
Yeah, you're right about that.
It's not the first day.

575
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:30,575
-It's Day 2, but it's their first date.
-[Car] Right.

576
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,911
She just gave him so much information.

577
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:35,330
-Yes, right, right.
-And it was a winding road.

578
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:37,582
-[Car] Right.
-If he's on a curve, he can't answer.

579
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:39,835
Right now, things aren't going his way.

580
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:43,296
I'd even hazard a guess that
he's never felt this emotion before

581
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,340
-in his life.
-[Eun-ji] She gave him too much.

582
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:51,138
[Sang-ho] I was surprised and frazzled

583
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:53,890
because she suddenly said that
while I was driving,

584
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:56,852
and I'm not such a great driver
in the first place.

585
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:59,104
[quirky music playing]

586
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:05,026
So while we were eating breakfast,
did you notice that we had the same juice?

587
00:24:06,444 --> 00:24:10,157
Well, I… I didn't…
I didn't notice it then. [chuckles]

588
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,158
[Ji-su] Hmm.

589
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:15,787
Who was your first impression pick?

590
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:16,830
Me?

591
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:19,374
[splutters] Can I… Can I say that?

592
00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:25,130
-I'll tell you soon.
-[chuckles] What?

593
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:26,506
[Sang-ho] When we arrive.

594
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,259
When we get there.

595
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:31,553
[Ji-su] Oh, these are tangerine orchards.

596
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:32,721
GREEN TANGERINE CAFE

597
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,890
[Ji-su] Hi. How are you?

598
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,892
[cafe staff]
This is a green tangerine orchard.

599
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:39,394
We're going to pick some tangerines
and make jam.

600
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:41,479
[upbeat music playing]

601
00:24:43,481 --> 00:24:44,566
[Sang-ho grunts]

602
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:47,027
-What is this?
-Oh, aprons.

603
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:49,070
-[music fades]
-[Sang-ho inhales deeply]

604
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:50,739
How do I…

605
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:58,663
Are you okay? Can I help you?

606
00:24:58,747 --> 00:24:59,915
Oh, I got it.

607
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:02,500
Huh.

608
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:07,339
[quirky music playing]

609
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:08,423
Uh…

610
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:10,550
[chuckles]

611
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:11,885
-"Oh, I got it"?
-Come on!

612
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:14,346
-I'm… I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
-Hey!

613
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:16,056
I should apologize.

614
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:18,475
-I lowered Sang-ho's…
-[Eun-ji] "I'm fine" is a bit…

615
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:20,518
I think I lowered
his expectations too much,

616
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:22,062
so right now, Sang-ho's thinking,

617
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:24,397
-"What? Who, me?
-[Eun-ji] My God!

618
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:26,441
Ji-su keeps trying to make a move,

619
00:25:26,524 --> 00:25:28,944
but Sang-ho
isn't playing along with it at all.

620
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:30,487
Sang-ho seems a bit frazzled,

621
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:33,907
but it's also possible
that he just isn't interested in Ji-su.

622
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,825
-[In-guk] "Isn't interested?"
-[laughs]

623
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:38,328
-Still, he shouldn't act so dumb.
-[In-guk] It's not that.

624
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:40,538
I've never seen a guy like this
on a dating show.

625
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:41,873
"He shouldn't act so dumb."

626
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:43,416
[Han-na] Jeez. Oh, no.

627
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,171
These smell so good.

628
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:49,172
Yeah, they do.

629
00:25:49,256 --> 00:25:52,968
Hey, you know, this is the first time
we're actually talking.

630
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,261
[pleasant music playing]

631
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:58,556
Yesterday, I thought, "Oh, I should
talk to him while making dinner."

632
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:02,686
But when I'm told to do something,
I only focus on the task.

633
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:05,438
I really don't know how to multitask.

634
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:07,983
Even now, I'm cutting,
then stopping to talk,

635
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,985
and then cutting again. [chuckles]

636
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:11,528
That's why I keep pausing.

637
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:13,196
-Oh, me too.
-Hmm.

638
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,239
I'm, uh…

639
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,241
Hmm.

640
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:17,742
[music fades]

641
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,119
[Han-na] Ah.

642
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,374
Oh, you said you'd tell me
who your first impression pick was.

643
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:27,711
-Oh, so, actually--
-You're avoiding the question.

644
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:30,046
Actually, at first…

645
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:34,301
I liked Yeo-myung, actually.

646
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:35,510
-What?
-Yeo-myung.

647
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:37,304
-Yeo-myung?
-Yeah.

648
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:40,015
-Why'd you say that?
-[Car] She looks so disappointed.

649
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:43,601
I saw her, she was in front of me…

650
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:47,230
I didn't think much about who I picked,

651
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:48,773
[tense music playing]

652
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:59,200
Did you pick quickly?
Or did you really think about it first?

653
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:00,618
-My pick?
-Yeah.

654
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:02,704
-I picked quickly.
-Oh, I also just--

655
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:05,874
Actually, you're the closest
to my ideal type,

656
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:07,834
-appearance-wise.
-Oh, really?

657
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:10,378
-I like the teddy bear type.
-[chuckles] Okay.

658
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:14,674
Oh, but if you picked Yeo-myung…

659
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:16,676
-Yeah?
-Does that mean you…

660
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:20,263
Do you like girls like Yeo-myung?
Kind of put-together and cute?

661
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:21,306
[Sang-ho] Actually,

662
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,391
it wasn't that deep.

663
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:25,477
When I first saw her, she was smiling,

664
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,562
so I thought, "She seems nice."

665
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:29,522
So I just picked her. Just like that.

666
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:30,732
[Ji-su exhales]

667
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:32,400
So, I think,

668
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:34,861
first impressions are important,

669
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:39,032
but it honestly didn't mean much
'cause it was so fast. I picked so fast.

670
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:41,618
I think first impressions
are important though.

671
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:42,577
[Sang-ho] Oh, really?

672
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:46,122
Like, doesn't the fact that someone
caught your eye right away

673
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:49,125
mean that you like that person the most?

674
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:54,339
What are your specific qualifications
that you look for in a partner?

675
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:55,382
Oh, I see.

676
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:58,760
I guess I just personally don't think
they're that important.

677
00:27:58,843 --> 00:27:59,803
[Ji-su] Hmm.

678
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:01,262
[Sang-ho] Not to me anyway.

679
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:03,348
[whimsical music playing]

680
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:07,852
[music fades]

681
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:10,855
So did you have anything
you wanted to ask me?

682
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,983
-To ask you?
-I didn't think you did. [chuckles]

683
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:17,362
Well, before now,
we didn't get to talk this much.

684
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:18,488
[Ji-su] Hmm.

685
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:20,615
-Hmm.
-[gentle music playing]

686
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:24,661
So, you said you liked
the teddy bear type?

687
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:26,996
What's your ideal type?

688
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,416
My ideal type is, uh…

689
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:34,129
someone who smiles a lot.

690
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:35,296
-Or--
-Smiles a lot?

691
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:38,007
And who's easygoing.

692
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:39,467
[music fades]

693
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:40,760
But honestly,

694
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:43,930
the reason I didn't pick you
is because you seemed

695
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:45,765
hard to approach.

696
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:48,643
-Me?
-I don't mean that in a bad way.

697
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,186
You just seem too… chic?

698
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:51,104
Me?

699
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:53,690
-Yeah, I get that sense from you.
-[Eun-ji] Ah.

700
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:55,150
[Sang-ho] So, what I mean is…

701
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:57,444
Just to make an analogy,

702
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:00,113
I'd be eating pork rice soup,

703
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:02,574
-and you'd be eating a steak.
-[laughs]

704
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:04,993
But I also love pork rice soup.

705
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:09,164
So that's why I kind of felt like,
"She seems like she's too good for me."

706
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:10,373
That's what I thought.

707
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:12,250
[light music playing]

708
00:29:13,042 --> 00:29:14,502
Oh.

709
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,421
-Oh, I didn't know you felt that way.
-I…

710
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:18,131
I think the others think so too.

711
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:20,258
-Oh. Why?
-But I'm not sure.

712
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:21,926
It's just the way you seem.

713
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,095
-I--
-Like the way you talk.

714
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:26,055
You seem so sophisticated.

715
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:27,140
[chuckles softly]

716
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,851
-Oh… Oh, I see.
-Yeah.

717
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:31,978
Well, maybe I should be more--

718
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:34,355
But I don't think
you need to change anything.

719
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,774
It's what makes you charming.

720
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:38,818
It'd be weird if you suddenly changed.

721
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:48,203
[music fades]

722
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:51,956
In my own way, I was trying to tell him,

723
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:53,500
"This is how I feel."

724
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:56,628
But I didn't feel anything
coming from Sang-ho.

725
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,380
"Is he not interested in me?"

726
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:02,008
"Is he only thinking about Yeo-myung?"

727
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,344
That's what I thought.

728
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:07,096
My confidence dropped a bit.

729
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:10,517
I might not wanna eat this.

730
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:13,353
[Sang-ho] After our date, I'd say that

731
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:15,188
I became more interested in her.

732
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:17,232
During the date,

733
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:21,569
my goal was to have a conversation
that went back and forth smoothly,

734
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:24,447
and I think I did pretty well.

735
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:27,116
[Car] What do you mean, "back and forth"?

736
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,743
Where was the back and forth?

737
00:30:28,827 --> 00:30:30,453
No, Sang-ho. You didn't do well.

738
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:33,790
Both parties should talk
for it to be a smooth conversation.

739
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:35,375
It really didn't flow that well.

740
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:38,127
-The conversation barely flowed.
-There was no back and forth.

741
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:39,796
[laughing]

742
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:41,047
[quirky music playing]

743
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:43,466
-[Ji-su groans]
-[Sang-ho] Sorry, sorry.

744
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:46,845
Oh, I was just getting
a bit sleepy from my food coma,

745
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:48,805
but I'm gonna stay awake.

746
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:52,600
[Sang-ho] Okay, where am I going?
Didn't we come this way?

747
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,269
[Ji-su] Oh, it's okay. It's…

748
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:55,520
It's that way.

749
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:57,522
-[Sang-ho] The other way?
-[Ji-su] Yes.

750
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:01,401
That date must've been very stimulating.

751
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:03,570
-[Car] Totally.
-As soon as he got in the car, just--

752
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:05,446
It must've been too much to handle.

753
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:08,074
Yeah, she said, "I chose you
for the first impression pick."

754
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:12,829
But when Ji-su kept asking
who he picked for his first impression,

755
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:15,039
what would have been the right answer?

756
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:17,125
Well, you know, something like,

757
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:19,460
-"It's a secret." Or…
-[Han-na] He should've said that?

758
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:21,170
He shouldn't have told her.

759
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:24,340
Just say that and be like,
"Well, this is only our first date,

760
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:27,260
and it's still too soon to
really get to know someone," you know?

761
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:28,428
-[Car] Say nothing.
-Yeah.

762
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:30,763
He could've just said that and moved on.

763
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:32,599
He didn't have to say
he chose someone else.

764
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:34,642
[Eun-ji] He could've kept that a secret.

765
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:35,977
ONE-ON-ONE DATE
HYUN-KYU & YI DO

766
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,812
-[Do] Hello, Hyun-kyu.
-[Hyun-kyu] Hey.

767
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,565
-[Do] Wow, the weather is great.
-[pleasant music playing]

768
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:42,442
-Such a clear day.
-[Hyun-kyu] It cleared up.

769
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:44,152
[music fades]

770
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,154
So was there anyone

771
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:49,741
you particularly
wanted to go on this date with?

772
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:51,284
Uh…

773
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:54,370
Actually, I wanted
to go on a date with you

774
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:56,164
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

775
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,082
[Eun-ji] Hey, listen to that, Yi Do!

776
00:31:58,166 --> 00:32:01,294
I wanted to go on a date with people
I wanted to get to know more.

777
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:04,631
I mean, we don't know each other
very well yet.

778
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:06,049
[mellow music playing]

779
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:08,217
Was there anyone else?

780
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:09,302
Someone else?

781
00:32:10,386 --> 00:32:12,138
I… I'm not sure yet.

782
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:13,890
Oh. [chuckles]

783
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:17,226
So, what about you?

784
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:18,311
[music fades]

785
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:20,146
Uh…

786
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:21,981
[turn signal clicking]

787
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:24,567
Wait, make a left here.

788
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:25,693
[Car] Ah…

789
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,028
-Okay.
-[In-guk] Oh, dear.

790
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,529
Oh, dear.

791
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:29,948
Oh, dear.

792
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:31,908
[pensive music playing]

793
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:34,911
-[Do] This must be it.
-[Hyun-kyu] It's this, right?

794
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:36,579
[Do] Yes, this is it.

795
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:38,331
Wow, this is pretty.

796
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:40,166
It's super pretty.

797
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:42,418
[upbeat song playing]

798
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:46,923
[Do] It's so, so pretty. Oh, my gosh!

00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:49,759
-[Hyun-kyu] Wanna go in?
-[Do] Okay.

801
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:51,177
-Should we try it?
-Okay.

802
00:32:58,601 --> 00:32:59,435
[song fades]

803
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,813
So what's your ideal type?

804
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:05,733
-The "tofu" type.
-The "tofu" type?

805
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,652
-Yeah.
-Tofu.

806
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:11,114
-A fair complexion and soft-looking.
-Hmm.

807
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:14,242
-Fair and soft…
-With feminine features.

808
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:16,452
-Hmm.
-[intriguing music playing]

809
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:18,705
Oh, Hyun-kyu isn't very fair-skinned.

810
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:20,957
No, Hyun-kyu isn't the tofu type.

811
00:33:21,916 --> 00:33:25,211
Do you like active people
or someone more chill?

812
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,630
I'm the chill type, so…

813
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:28,840
[Do] Hmm.

814
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:30,675
I think I like that better.

815
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:34,095
If someone is too active,
it'd be a lot to handle.

816
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:36,973
Oh, that's the opposite of Yi Do.

817
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:38,182
They're opposites.

818
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:40,059
[music fades]

819
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:41,227
Yesterday…

820
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:43,771
-When you got here…
-Yeah?

821
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:46,024
…did you see anyone
who was closest to your type?

822
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:47,775
Closest to my type?

823
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:50,903
Well, it wasn't 100%,

824
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:54,073
but there was someone
who was pretty close to my ideal type.

825
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:55,158
[Do] Hmm.

826
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:58,870
Oh, why didn't you vote for that person?

827
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:02,540
-What? Vote? When?
-[both chuckle]

828
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:04,959
-Why are you acting dumb?
-Oh, today? For this date?

829
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,294
-No.
-What?

830
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:09,589
-I mean, for the first impression pick.
-What? Oh, the first impression pick.

831
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:12,967
Can we talk about that? [chuckles]

832
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:15,511
Wait, we already
talked about it in the car.

833
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:17,305
-What do you mean?
-Oh, well, I don't…

834
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:20,016
-I don't think I answered that question.
-[Han-na] Huh?

835
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:23,186
Oh, wasn't that it? Did you just tell me
your first impression of me?

836
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:24,270
-Yeah. I…
-[chuckles]

837
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:26,647
Well, I didn't tell you
my first impression pick.

838
00:34:26,731 --> 00:34:27,565
EARLIER

839
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:29,942
…you particularly
wanted to go on this date with?

840
00:34:30,526 --> 00:34:32,737
Actually, I wanted to
go on a date with you too.

841
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,155
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

842
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:36,532
Was there anyone else?

843
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:37,658
Someone else?

844
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:40,244
I… I'm not sure yet.

845
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:42,163
Oh. [chuckles]

846
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:44,373
[Car and Eun-ji exclaim]

847
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:46,459
This and the first impression pick.

848
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:48,461
-[Eun-ji] They were confused.
-She was mistaken.

849
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:51,005
Oh, I see. She thought he voted for her.

850
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,965
Right, Hyun-kyu chose Ji-su

851
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:55,009
-for his first impression pick.
-[Car] Right.

852
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:57,428
Oh, weren't you talking about
your first impression pick?

853
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,597
No, I must've been
talking about something else.

854
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,266
-Oh, something else?
-Yeah, I must've been confused.

855
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,643
I misunderstood.

856
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:05,436
[tense whimsical music playing]

857
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,646
Ah.

858
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:08,731
[Han-na] Things aren't going too great.

859
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:12,485
-[Hyun-kyu] You took it the wrong way.
-We're not communicating well.

860
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:14,237
-[Hyun-kyu] Ah, sorry.
-[exclaims]

861
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,988
I meant something else.

862
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:20,535
[Do chuckles drily]

863
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:21,911
[Han-na] Ah.

864
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:24,539
[Car] She seems a little disappointed.

865
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:26,749
[Eun-ji] Yi Do's bubble just burst.

866
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,126
[Han-na] She thought it was her.

867
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:29,210
[In-guk] Hmm.

868
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:32,046
[music fades]

869
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:35,842
Well, I'm trying to read
the other person's reactions more.

870
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:38,344
So, I focused more on Do's reactions,

871
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:41,264
but then I started
getting the feeling like,

872
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:45,143
"Does this person
not see me as a romantic interest?"

873
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:48,104
So things were starting
to feel a little awkward.

874
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:51,649
I actually don't like green tea that much,

875
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:54,068
but Hyun-kyu seemed to enjoy it.

876
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:58,573
So I thought, "If someone else were here
who likes green tea more than me,

877
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:02,952
she might've had more interesting
conversations with Hyun-kyu."

878
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:04,704
I kept thinking about that.

879
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:09,542
Well, so that's how
the one-on-one dates went.

880
00:36:09,625 --> 00:36:12,420
The three-on-three group date
might be a little better.

881
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:15,006
Maybe they'll get closer
and it'll lead to something more.

882
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:17,049
Let's get our hopes up
for the three-on-three.

883
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:17,967
[Car] Sounds good.

884
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:19,927
-[Han-na] Things will pan out.
-[In-guk] Yeah.

885
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:22,805
SEUNG-LI, JAE-YUN, JEONG-MOK
MIN-HONG, YEO-MYUNG, JI-YEON

886
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:25,057
-[Jeong-mok] Here we go.
-[Min-hong] Let's go!

887
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:26,976
[Seung-li] I'll try to drive safely.

888
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:28,728
[turn signal clicking]

889
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:32,523
What do you think we'll do
at Eternal Singles' Night later?

890
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:36,652
-Won't we talk about jobs today?
-Jobs? Isn't it too early for that?

891
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,154
-Right, too soon.
-I know.

892
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:40,156
Jobs, or maybe revealing who we voted for?

893
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:41,324
Oh, jeez.

894
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:43,075
-Wow, that's huge.
-You might be right.

895
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:44,493
-Wait, no.
-[Seung-li] That hurts.

896
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:46,329
But that doesn't really matter

897
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:48,956
since our votes were
just based on first impressions.

898
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,375
-Yeah.
-[Min-hong] Just first impressions.

899
00:36:51,459 --> 00:36:52,835
Even on dating shows,

900
00:36:52,919 --> 00:36:56,923
the person who got all the votes at first
could still end up in the trash.

901
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:57,965
"In the trash."

902
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:01,219
Not in the trash. I just mean
that things might not go well for them.

903
00:37:01,302 --> 00:37:03,179
-"In the trash."
-I don't know what I'm saying.

904
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:04,889
[Seung-li] Showing your true self now.

905
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:06,849
[Min-hong] Since we've dropped
the formalities,

906
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:08,809
-we're speaking freely.
-[Ji-yeon] I know.

907
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:11,562
Have you guys changed your pick?

908
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:15,149
Yeah, I changed mine.

909
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:17,151
[gasps]

910
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:18,402
-What?
-[Han-na] What?

911
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:20,655
[light music playing]

912
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:21,739
Me too.

913
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:28,704
Yeah, I think…

914
00:37:30,122 --> 00:37:32,291
I've changed mine too.

915
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:33,876
[Han-na] He's changed his too.

916
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:37,046
[Yeo-myung] I…

917
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:39,048
I've definitely changed my mind.

918
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:40,299
[Yeo-myung] Why'd you change?

919
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:44,512
[Min-hong] The person I chose
for my first impression pick was Jae-yun,

920
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,138
but we really haven't talked yet.

921
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:49,016
Like, I don't even know
what his voice sounds like.

922
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,852
But I've actually had
a conversation with Jeong-mok.

923
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,104
Can I help you?

924
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:55,648
-Yeah, if you could hold the door.
-No, I got it.

925
00:37:55,731 --> 00:37:58,234
-It's good. Yeah, it's tasty.
-It looks good.

926
00:37:58,317 --> 00:38:02,530
[Min-hong] He kept making these
little jokes during the drive.

927
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:06,325
So I guess I was naturally drawn to him.

928
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:08,369
How about you?

929
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,371
-Me?
-Yeah.

930
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:11,664
I don't know.

931
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:14,834
-[Seung-li chuckles]
-Why aren't you telling us? You asked.

932
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:16,127
No comment.

933
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:17,878
Hey, you asked us first.

934
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:20,548
-[Yeo-myung] Why ask if you won't answer?
-You're such a tease.

935
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:21,924
Jeez, unbelievable.

936
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:23,009
That's harsh.

937
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:24,552
You just got information from us

938
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:26,345
-and left us hanging.
-[Yeo-myung] Right?

939
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:27,638
Mm, I haven't changed.

940
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,850
-[Cupids exclaim]
-Oh, is his pick still Yi Do?

941
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:33,602
-She's not here right now.
-[Car] You're right.

942
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:35,688
Min-hong and Jeong-mok's conversation

943
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:37,189
-is flowing well.
-[Car] It's good.

944
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:40,109
-They make a good couple, don't you think?
-[Eun-ji] Yeah.

945
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:42,445
-[Jeong-mok] Oh, it's a roller rink.
-[Seung-li] Oh.

946
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:44,864
-[Yeo-myung] Roller skating!
-[Min-hong] This looks fun!

947
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:46,157
[Ji-yeon] I can't skate.

948
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:48,075
[Yeo-myung] You can't?

949
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:49,368
It's my first time.

950
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:52,621
-It's everyone's first, right?
-[Jeong-mok] I think so.

951
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:55,207
[Yeo-myung] Do I just tie it like this?

952
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:02,840
[Jae-yun] Oh. Can I…

953
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:05,217
tie that for you?

954
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:06,802
Do I have to lace it all the way up?

955
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:07,887
YEO-MYUNG DIDN'T HEAR HIM

956
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,305
-Probably not?
-[Jae-yun] Oh, yes.

957
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:11,599
-Do I lace this up?
-Want me to tie yours?

958
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:12,641
Why?

959
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:14,810
[laughing]

960
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:16,520
-[Han-na] Hey, I mean…
-He heard!

961
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:19,106
-[Eun-ji] He heard!
-Why would you ask Seung-li?

962
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,024
No, don't do that.

963
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:21,942
[Car] Doesn't he look like
he can tie his own?

964
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:22,985
[Han-na] Not Seung-li.

965
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:25,613
Seung-li looks like
he can take care of himself, dude.

966
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,198
[Han-na] Seung-li went, "Why?"

967
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:28,824
"Why? Why me?"

968
00:39:28,908 --> 00:39:30,201
Come on!

969
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:32,411
Why?

970
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:36,332
Oh, if you can do it yourself…
[splutters] never mind.

971
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:38,793
[amusing music playing]

972
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:42,129
[Seung-li] You'll have to
sit down for this. You might slip.

973
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:45,091
Should I lace it all the way up?
I should, right?

974
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:46,884
-Not all the way.
-[Seung-li] No.

975
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:48,302
You'll slip.

976
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:49,804
I'm lacing all the way.

977
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:51,389
Can I tie it for you?

978
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:52,932
[Car] Oh, nice. Try again.

979
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:55,267
Oh, no, I'm fine.
I think I got it. [chuckles]

980
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:57,728
[Han-na] Oh, Yeo-myung. [groans]

981
00:39:58,437 --> 00:40:00,064
[Seung-li] I think I might fall.

982
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:03,359
[whimsical music playing]

983
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:05,736
They're all bravely tying their own.

984
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,197
This one should go in between here.

985
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:10,032
So, like this.

986
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:13,160
-This is too dangerous.
-[chuckles]

987
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:14,745
[Seung-li] Look.

988
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:19,083
[Eun-ji] Wait, why are you…
Why are you doing that for him?

989
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:22,086
[Han-na] The girls are helping girls,
guys are helping guys.

990
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:23,295
[Jeong-mok] Thank you.

991
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:27,842
I just feel like

992
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:30,302
we're not that close yet,

993
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:32,430
so having that close a physical contact

994
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:35,599
might have been too much,
so I didn't offer to help the girls.

995
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:39,812
But that mentality might be
one of the reasons I'm so single.

996
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:41,147
[chuckles]

997
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:42,982
"So single."

998
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:44,567
They're going at the right speed.

999
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:45,818
-He's right.
-[In-guk] Yeah.

1000
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:48,070
-The other person might feel pressured.
-Right.

1001
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:50,739
And it would feel awkward
to turn someone down too.

1002
00:40:50,823 --> 00:40:52,950
-[Han-na] That's true.
-This speed is good.

1003
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:56,454
-[Ji-yeon] Let's go inside.
-[Min-hong] It's so slippery.

1004
00:40:57,663 --> 00:41:00,207
-I'm scared. I'm getting really nervous.
-Hey, this…

1005
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:01,333
[both exhale nervously]

1006
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:03,586
[Yeo-myung] I think I need some time
to get used to it.

1007
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:05,671
[pleasant music playing]

1008
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:13,053
[nervously] Oh.

1009
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:15,806
This… Oh, I'm gonna fall.

1010
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:19,477
[music fades]

1011
00:41:20,102 --> 00:41:21,437
How is everyone?

1012
00:41:22,354 --> 00:41:23,564
[Jeong-mok panting]

1013
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:25,524
[groans, chuckles]

1014
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,776
-[Car] There you go!
-[In-guk] Oh, no!

1015
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:30,821
-Someone had to go down first, I guess.
-Dangerous. Right.

1016
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:33,199
Yeah, hey,
you started things off, Jeong-mok.

1017
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:35,743
-They're all laughing.
-[Han-na] Made people laugh. Good job.

1018
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:37,870
-But how does someone fall like…
-[Han-na] Oh, gosh.

1019
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:39,371
-[In-guk] Yeah.
-[laughs]

1020
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:40,664
Like he's lying down.

1021
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:41,957
[both laughing]

1022
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:45,586
[Han-na] He spun. Even his head is down.
That was a big fall.

1023
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:47,046
[amusing music playing]

1024
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:48,088
[groans]

1025
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,465
[Min-hong] Oh, my God.

1026
00:41:50,341 --> 00:41:52,676
-[laughing]
-[women laughing]

1027
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:55,679
-[Ji-yeon] Are you okay?
-Hey, but he fell…

1028
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:57,640
[Seung-li] Hey, what, what?

1029
00:41:58,474 --> 00:41:59,642
Did you hit your head?

1030
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:00,851
Oh.

1031
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,728
You okay? Are you all right?

1032
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:04,271
I'm fine. I'm fine.

1033
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:06,607
I almost died.

1034
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,568
[Ji-yeon] Oh, no.

1035
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,111
[grunts]

1036
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:12,154
Oh.

1037
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:15,282
It might be better if I hold on.

1038
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:16,742
Yeah, if you keep your core tight…

1039
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:19,703
Like an ab workout,
just hold this and keep going.

1040
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:21,789
If I do this, I'll do the splits.

1041
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:25,459
-[Min-hong] Oh.
-[gasps] You're doing great.

1042
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,920
[Min-hong] I'll do a lap
and get the hang of it.

1043
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:30,631
-[upbeat music playing]
-[Yeo-myung chuckles]

1044
00:42:30,714 --> 00:42:32,132
I think I'm good at this.

1045
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,884
[Han-na] Yeo-myung is doing well.

1046
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:36,011
[Ji-yeon] How are you so good?

1047
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:37,429
Oh, she's good.

1048
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:39,014
Why is she so good?

1049
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:40,933
[chuckles softly]

1050
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,728
I'm… I'm good, aren't I?

1051
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:45,729
Oh, what?

1052
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:47,231
-[Yeo-myung] Aren't I?
-Good.

1053
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:48,315
[splutters] I'm not.

1054
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,484
[Han-na and Car laughing]

1055
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:53,487
-The boys should hold the girls' hands.
-[Ji-yeon] You're doing great.

1056
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:54,488
[Yeo-myung gasps]

1057
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:55,739
[amusing music playing]

1058
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,700
I think I'm too scared to skate.

1059
00:42:57,783 --> 00:42:58,993
I can't go anywhere.

1060
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:01,453
[Min-hong] Wait.
Hang on, let me hold your hand.

1061
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:03,581
Okay, just try this first.

1062
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:06,792
Move your feet like this.
Just practice this with your feet.

1063
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:08,335
I'll watch you. Look at me.

1064
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:10,254
Like this.

1065
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:12,923
[Car chuckling] What's Seung-li doing?
What are you doing?

1066
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:14,341
-What is that?
-[exhales]

1067
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:16,010
[Ji-yeon] What am I doing?

1068
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,470
Together… [chuckles] My legs.

1069
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:20,681
[Min-hong] No, no, no, just…
Hang on. Just…

1070
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:22,558
-[laughing]
-Just stand still. Stay still.

1071
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:26,520
-[Ji-yeon] But I can't take a single step.
-[Min-hong] Use your strength.

1072
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,314
[Eun-ji] Is he coming? Jeong-mok's coming.

1073
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:30,816
-[Ji-yeon] I'm too scared to move.
-[Min-hong] Look here.

1074
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:32,860
[enchanting music playing]

1075
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:35,237
-Here he comes.
-Jeong-mok to the rescue.

1076
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:37,406
-[Eun-ji] Hold her hand!
-[Han-na] He's helping her?

1077
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:44,705
I really can't do this at all.
I just can't.

1078
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:47,082
-[chuckles]
-Okay then, let's go to that bench.

1079
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:49,877
Easy does it.
[sighs] Try this, then. Go like…

1080
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:52,838
-Try this. Then, go like…
-[Yeo-myung] Can you do this?

1081
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:54,006
[amusing music playing]

1082
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:55,132
-[chuckles]
-[Eun-ji] Okay.

1083
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:57,509
-What did he do?
-[Car laughing] What was that?

1084
00:43:57,593 --> 00:43:58,927
Did he just tap the wall and go?

1085
00:43:59,011 --> 00:44:01,597
-Oh, I think he needed brakes.
-[Car] What?

1086
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,057
Oh, brakes.

1087
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,351
-[In-guk] The wall brakes.
-[Car] He needed the wall.

1088
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:08,228
-[In-guk] He can't stop.
-Why'd he have to do that in between them?

1089
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:09,438
[Eun-ji] Oh, God.

1090
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:10,439
[Ji-yeon grunts]

1091
00:44:10,522 --> 00:44:12,816
-I can't. No, I think I might get hurt.
-[Min-hong] Then…

1092
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:16,403
[Jeong-mok] I was gonna hold her hand,
but then after falling once, I thought,

1093
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:19,782
"If I hold her hand, we might both
fall down and get seriously hurt."

1094
00:44:19,865 --> 00:44:22,284
So I thought,
"I should just stay out of it."

1095
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:25,371
-So that's why.
-[Eun-ji] He's too cautious.

1096
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:27,206
Practice without the wall.

1097
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:29,458
-[laughs]
-Wow, you're a strict teacher.

1098
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:31,001
So, this… Your foot…

1099
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:34,171
Rather than going like this…

1100
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:36,131
-Like this?
-Yeah, look at his feet.

1101
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:37,132
-Like that.
-Like that?

1102
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:38,050
Jae-yun!

1103
00:44:38,133 --> 00:44:39,843
-[Min-hong] Slowly.
-That's it.

1104
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:41,845
[Min-hong] One, two…

1105
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:45,140
-Better, right? Isn't that so much better?
-[Yeo-myung] Totally!

1106
00:44:45,224 --> 00:44:46,975
-[Ji-yeon] Amazing, right?
-Doing so well.

1107
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:48,560
But I can't if you don't hold me.

1108
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:50,270
I'll keep holding you.

1109
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:51,772
Slowly, trust me. [chuckles]

1110
00:44:52,564 --> 00:44:54,441
We'll hold you until the end.

1111
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:57,528
-[Yeo-myung] Like this. Slowly.
-If you end up going too wide, just go…

1112
00:44:57,611 --> 00:44:59,113
-Hey, sorry, but…
-[laughs]

1113
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:01,156
…are you gonna practice all day long?

1114
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:02,658
[In-guk] What?

1115
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:06,036
-[Car] What did he say?
-"Are you gonna practice all day long?"

1116
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,539
He should be helping.
Is he seriously mocking them right now?

1117
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:10,916
-[In-guk] He just…
-He's barely getting by himself.

1118
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:13,377
-Did he think it's a competition?
-Competition?

1119
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:16,213
-[Han-na] Is he thinking this is a sport?
-Oh, Seung-li…

1120
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:17,464
On a dating show?

1121
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:19,883
-Yeah, he just…
-[Car] Seung-li would think that.

1122
00:45:20,717 --> 00:45:22,094
[Han-na] He's missing the point.

1123
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:26,098
[Yeo-myung] Ji-yeon didn't know
how to skate,

1124
00:45:26,181 --> 00:45:29,518
so I thought it would be nice for the guys
to come and help her out.

1125
00:45:29,601 --> 00:45:31,854
You know, this was
supposed to be a group date.

1126
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:33,689
But no one was helping her.

1127
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:36,233
[Min-hong] It didn't feel like a date.

1128
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:39,528
I was hoping they'd come and lend a hand
when we were struggling,

1129
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:42,114
but they were too busy
skating on their own.

1130
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:44,408
I just felt frustrated.

1131
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:46,326
[whimsical music playing]

1132
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:47,703
It hurts.

1133
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:50,581
-Even I'm frustrated.
-That's how we feel.

1134
00:45:50,664 --> 00:45:52,249
[Han-na] She's feeling the frustration.

1135
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:54,168
[sighs wearily]

1136
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:56,170
[Han-na gasps]

1137
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:59,089
I've been interested in Jae-yun
since yesterday,

1138
00:45:59,173 --> 00:46:01,341
but he was so focused on skating.

1139
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:03,177
He was just skating on his own.

1140
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,971
So, I figured
he just wanted to do his own thing.

1141
00:46:07,973 --> 00:46:10,100
[Yeo-myung] Shouldn't a guy be doing this?

1142
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:13,562
I know, girl.
Why are we doing this ourselves?

1143
00:46:13,645 --> 00:46:15,898
Who do you like?
Who do you wish was helping?

1144
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:16,815
What?

1145
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:18,775
[Han-na] Here he goes again. Look at this.

1146
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:21,069
[Car] What is he doing right now?

1147
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:23,822
[Eun-ji] Does the person
who takes the most laps win a prize?

1148
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:26,158
-[laughs]
-God, this is so funny though.

1149
00:46:26,241 --> 00:46:27,534
-[Han-na] What is this?
-I mean…

1150
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:29,870
What's the difference between this
and Walking Dead?

1151
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:30,954
[Han-na] What is this?

1152
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:33,749
-He looks like he's on Walking Dead.
-[Han-na] I know, what is…

1153
00:46:33,832 --> 00:46:36,960
-What is he even thinking?
-What is this? I don't understand.

1154
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:39,796
-This wasn't at all what we expected.
-[Eun-ji] I really can't watch…

1155
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,257
I can't watch this. [laughs]

1156
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:44,593
-[In-guk] Let me get water.
-[Eun-ji] Can I step outside?

1157
00:46:44,676 --> 00:46:46,386
-I seriously…
-I think I need some soju.

1158
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:48,013
-I can't even…
-This is so frustrating.

1159
00:46:48,096 --> 00:46:50,557
I mean, how are you all
just watching this?

1160
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:52,643
[Han-na] Unbelievable.
Aren't you frustrated?

1161
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:55,020
Aren't you guys frustrated?

1162
00:46:55,103 --> 00:46:57,523
-[Car] In the meantime…
-[Eun-ji] How did you edit this?

1163
00:46:57,606 --> 00:47:00,442
-I'm going crazy just watching it.
-[Han-na] This is infuriating.

1164
00:47:00,526 --> 00:47:01,360
[Eun-ji exclaims]

1165
00:47:01,443 --> 00:47:02,611
-Wow.
-This is a date. A date.

1166
00:47:02,694 --> 00:47:03,695
[Eun-ji] What do we do?

1167
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:05,739
I can't believe this.
Seriously, what is this?

1168
00:47:05,822 --> 00:47:06,823
[Eun-ji] What do we do?

1169
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:09,701
This is just too hard for me.

1170
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:12,913
-I don't think I can do this. I know.
-Inline skates are much easier.

1171
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:16,083
-[Yeo-myung] What'll you do?
-Pretend to skate with my slippers on.

1172
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:17,292
-Good.
-[Ji-yeon] Good idea?

1173
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:18,877
Yeah, you should hold our hands.

1174
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:19,795
[all laughing]

1175
00:47:19,878 --> 00:47:21,713
[Ji-yeon] Are you okay? Hey, are you okay?

1176
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:23,048
-[Yeo-myung] Yikes.
-Don't look.

1177
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:23,966
[Ji-yeon] You okay?

1178
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:25,425
-[Min-hong] Ignore him.
-Look away.

1179
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:27,594
-[Min-hong] He said not to look at him.
-[laughing]

1180
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:29,972
[slow bluesy music playing]

1181
00:47:30,055 --> 00:47:32,182
[Seung-li] Slapstick comedy. Smooth.

1182
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:34,142
-So embarrassing.
-[Seung-li chuckles]

1183
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:36,103
Still going?

1184
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:38,981
If you wanna keep skating, go ahead.

1185
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:41,525
I'm gonna just rest here.

1186
00:47:42,317 --> 00:47:44,278
I'm going to skate. Who wants to join?

1187
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:45,988
-Who wants to join?
-[In-guk] What?!

1188
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:48,407
[Han-na] Oh, she did it.

1189
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:51,034
[pleasant music playing]

1190
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:56,832
-[Yeo-myung] Have you gotten better?
-[Jae-yun] No, not at all.

1191
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:00,752
-[laughs]
-[Jae-yun] Is this right?

1192
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:02,838
[Yeo-myung] Very smooth.

1193
00:48:03,505 --> 00:48:04,423
[Jae-yun] Smooth.

1194
00:48:07,509 --> 00:48:09,261
-Very smooth.
-[chuckles]

1195
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:13,765
I think it helps you skate better
if you swing your arms like this.

1196
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:16,268
Hey, it's finally
starting to look like a date.

1197
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:17,394
[In-guk] Hold hands!

1198
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:19,980
[chuckling] Wow.
But I don't know how to stop.

1199
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:22,649
[softly] Smooth. Smooth.

1200
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:28,030
"Smooth. Smooth."
Why does he keep saying that? [laughs]

1201
00:48:28,113 --> 00:48:29,239
[chuckling] "Smooth."

1202
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:30,949
[In-guk] Yeah, that's not smooth.

1203
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:32,659
[enchanting music playing]

1204
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:34,244
[Yeo-myung] You're doing pretty well.

1205
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:35,537
[chuckling] Okay then.

1206
00:48:36,204 --> 00:48:38,457
-Wanna race?
-[Jae-yun] What if I lose?

1207
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:40,292
I'll flick you.

1208
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:42,502
[chuckling] You'll… flick me?

1209
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:44,838
Here we go. I think I'm going to win.

1210
00:48:44,921 --> 00:48:46,506
[enchanting music continues]

1211
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:48,133
[laughs]

1212
00:48:52,554 --> 00:48:53,555
Ooh.

1213
00:48:57,726 --> 00:48:58,685
[Jae-yun exhales]

1214
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:02,189
[Cupids laughing]

1215
00:49:02,898 --> 00:49:04,733
[chuckling] Should I not
have suggested this?

1216
00:49:04,816 --> 00:49:07,778
[chuckling] No. Where will you flick me?

1217
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:09,863
[chuckles] I won't flick you.

1218
00:49:09,946 --> 00:49:12,240
I don't think I'm mean enough to do that.

1219
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:16,036
[softly] Smooth. Smooth. Smooth.

1220
00:49:19,247 --> 00:49:22,334
I wanted to show her that I was
good at something, so I kept skating,

1221
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:24,419
but it didn't really go as I'd hoped.

1222
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:26,254
It was disappointing.

1223
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:27,714
[music fades]

1224
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:28,757
[chuckling]

1225
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:32,177
I could see that Jae-yun
was trying really hard,

1226
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:34,596
but he looked like
he was really struggling.

1227
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:36,306
I felt so bad about that.

1228
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:38,392
I just felt really bad for him.

1229
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:41,812
I didn't really
say it directly to Jeong-mok,

1230
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:44,064
but I was like, "Let's skate together."

1231
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:46,775
I wanted to skate with Jeong-mok, but…

1232
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,236
I'm going to skate. Who wants to join?

1233
00:49:49,319 --> 00:49:50,821
[Han-na] Oh, this is…

1234
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:53,240
[Car] Oh,
so it was supposed to be Jeong-mok.

1235
00:49:53,323 --> 00:49:55,325
[Han-na] Yeo-myung
wanted to go with Jeong-mok.

1236
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:59,162
[Yeo-myung] They said I should go
with Jae-yun, so I went with him.

1237
00:49:59,246 --> 00:50:03,125
But the experience is really different,
depending on who I'm with.

1238
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:07,129
[chuckles] Jae-yun
doesn't really talk much at all,

1239
00:50:07,212 --> 00:50:12,050
so I think it would've been hard
if we'd been a one-on-one date together.

1240
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:16,138
-[Car] Ah.
-If Jae-yun had been a bit more proactive…

1241
00:50:16,221 --> 00:50:17,055
[Han-na] I know.

1242
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:20,350
But all he does is go around saying,
"Smooth, smooth," all day.

1243
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:23,562
Oh, I feel kind of bad
for this robot zombie looking for love.

1244
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:24,479
[Han-na] I know.

1245
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:26,606
Jae-yun is rooming with Jeong-mok now.

1246
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:29,401
So Jeong-mok must've seen
that Jae-yun put his hand up.

1247
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:32,362
-He did.
-[Car] He knows what his friend is like.

1248
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:34,406
And now that I think about it,

1249
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:36,992
Yeo-myung kept missing what Jae-yun said

1250
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:39,161
because her focus is all on Jeong-mok.

1251
00:50:39,244 --> 00:50:40,328
[Car] Right. That's right.

1252
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:41,997
You're right. If she were interested,

1253
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,541
she'd look at him
even when he talks quietly.

1254
00:50:44,624 --> 00:50:47,753
[Eun-ji] Like when he said,
"Can I tie it for you?" That was his move.

1255
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:48,670
[Han-na] I know.

1256
00:50:48,754 --> 00:50:49,963
It's all so complicated.

1257
00:50:50,046 --> 00:50:52,007
Jae-yun is interested in Yeo-myung.

1258
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:53,884
-Yeo-myung is into Jeong-mok.
-Yeah.

1259
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:55,635
-And Jeong-mok is into Do.
-[Eun-ji] Yep.

1260
00:50:56,261 --> 00:50:58,180
But they'll keep going on dates, right?

1261
00:50:58,263 --> 00:50:59,639
Will they get better?

1262
00:51:00,348 --> 00:51:02,768
[Han-na] Can we keep airing
these awful dates?

1263
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:05,520
I mean, if they don't get better,
tell us in advance.

1264
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:07,439
-[Eun-ji] Warn me.
-So we can be prepared.

1265
00:51:07,522 --> 00:51:09,399
-I'll take an antacid.
-I hope it gets better.

1266
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:10,567
[Eun-ji] Please.

1267
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:12,527
[mellow music playing]

1268
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:14,863
[Yeo-myung] Oh, we're home. [chuckles]

1269
00:51:14,946 --> 00:51:16,531
-[cell phone chimes]
-[Jae-yun] Oh, God.

1270
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:18,575
A MESSAGE HAS ARRIVED

1271
00:51:18,658 --> 00:51:20,202
-[cell phone chimes]
-He… What?

1272
00:51:21,828 --> 00:51:22,704
Oh, here we go.

1273
00:51:22,788 --> 00:51:25,624
"Please gather at the Event Zone
by the Igloo. Bundle up."

1274
00:51:25,707 --> 00:51:26,541
-Okay.
-Ready?

1275
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:29,419
-They're telling us to bundle up.
-We're dressed warmly.

1276
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:31,713
We should look cold.
Someone will give us their coat.

1277
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:33,965
[Yeo-myung gasps] Wow, you're so sneaky.

1278
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:36,885
-But watch me just shiver alone.
-[Yeo-myung] Sneaky fox.

1279
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:38,220
-No, Ji-su.
-[Han-na] Oh, Ji-su.

1280
00:51:38,303 --> 00:51:41,348
I wouldn't count on that if I were you.
These guys don't seem too promising.

1281
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:42,808
These guys wear two puffer jackets

1282
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:44,142
-on top of each other.
-Right.

1283
00:51:44,726 --> 00:51:46,478
You should really bundle up.

1284
00:51:46,561 --> 00:51:48,563
[mellow music playing]

1285
00:51:49,564 --> 00:51:50,649
MALE ETERNAL SINGLES' NIGHT

1286
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:53,109
[Yeo-myung] Today is
Male Eternal Singles' Night.

1287
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:55,278
[Ji-su] Huh?
It's Male Eternal Singles' Night.

1288
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:57,614
So we're hearing from the guys tonight?

1289
00:51:57,697 --> 00:52:00,700
-Yeah, could be.
-I don't have much to say about myself.

1290
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:03,745
-[Ji-su] You, uh, want some?
-[Yeo-myung] Want some?

1291
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:05,497
Let's each pour our own drinks.

1292
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:06,623
More efficient.

1293

-[dramatic music playing]
-[indistinct chatter]

1294
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:16,508
Is that someone new?

1295
00:52:16,591 --> 00:52:17,676
-[gasps]
-[Han-na] What?

1296
00:52:17,759 --> 00:52:19,177
-A new face?
-[In-guk] A new member.

1297
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:20,303
It's a guy. It's a guy.

1298
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:21,972
Is another man joining them?

1299
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:26,768
[dramatic music continues]

1300
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:29,729
[indistinct chatter]

1301
00:52:30,897 --> 00:52:32,148
[women exclaim and laugh]

1302
00:52:32,941 --> 00:52:34,693
-[man] Hello.
-[Seung-li] Hey. Come on over.

1303
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:36,653
-[Ji-yeon] So cute.
-[man] Hello.

1304
00:52:36,736 --> 00:52:37,696
[Seung-li] Hey.

1305
00:52:37,779 --> 00:52:39,030
[man] Nice to meet you.

1306
00:52:39,614 --> 00:52:40,699
-Oh, wow.
-Who is it?

1307
00:52:40,782 --> 00:52:42,993
-[man] Nice to meet you.
-Jeez, he scared me.

1308
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:44,786
Uh, who… Who is it?

1309
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:45,829
[man] Nice to meet you.

1310
00:52:45,912 --> 00:52:48,498
-[Ji-su] Hello.
-[Min-hong] Why is he alone? He's alone.

1311
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:50,000
I just moved in.

1312
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:51,251
-[Hyun-kyu] What?
-What?

1313
00:52:51,334 --> 00:52:52,878
[Jeong-mok] Oh, wait. What?

1314
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:55,255
-[man] Yes.
-[Seung-li] I knew this'd happen.

1315
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:56,882
[Hyun-kyu] The light in front came on.

1316
00:52:56,965 --> 00:52:58,133
KANG HYUN-KYU
LEE SEUNG-CHAN

1317
00:52:58,216 --> 00:52:59,134
[Ji-su] Come this way.

1318
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:01,511
Is that why tonight
is Male Eternal Singles' Night?

1319
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:03,054
[Do] Shall we welcome him?

1320
00:53:03,138 --> 00:53:05,015
-Clap, clap. Nice to meet you.
-[Min-hong] Wow.

1321
00:53:05,098 --> 00:53:06,433
-Hello.
-[Ji-su] I was surprised.

1322
00:53:07,183 --> 00:53:11,563
Hello, I'm Lee Seung-chan,
and I've been single for 31 years.

1323
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:14,566
-[Car] Hey, he's hot.
-[Eun-ji] He's handsome.

1324
00:53:14,649 --> 00:53:15,775
[Han-na] Wow!

1325
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:18,612
-Yeah, that's my buddy, Seung-chan.
-Who is it?

1326
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:20,405
-He's my hidden card.
-[Car] He's handsome.

1327
00:53:20,488 --> 00:53:23,033
-[Eun-ji] Jeez.
-Hey, he looks so young.

1328
00:53:23,116 --> 00:53:24,576
[Eun-ji] Is he the oldest guy, then?

1329
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:30,790
[Min-hong] He looks like
a lot of girls would like him.

1330
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:32,167
He's good-looking.

1331
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:34,377
[Yeo-myung] I thought he had a nice voice.

1332
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:38,715
[Min-hong] But we have to
speak casually here. Starting now.

1333
00:53:38,798 --> 00:53:41,509
-Want to do what we did yesterday?
-Shall we?

1334
00:53:41,593 --> 00:53:44,804
-Yeah.
-Oh, then here's the first question.

1335
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:47,724
"Why have you been single since birth?"

1336
00:53:48,391 --> 00:53:49,726
Why I've been single since birth?

1337
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:52,020
[Min-hong] Why you think
you've been single since birth.

1338
00:53:52,103 --> 00:53:54,773
-Diving right in here? Soon as I arrive?
-[Sang-ho] Trial by fire.

1339
00:53:54,856 --> 00:53:56,566
You can… take your time to think.

1340
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:57,734
[insects trilling]

1341
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:00,487
By any chance,

1342
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:05,909
did anyone say they had
a very short relationship last night?

1343
00:54:06,868 --> 00:54:07,744
[Ji-yeon] Last night?

1344
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:09,663
[Seung-chan] When you were
talking last night.

1345
00:54:10,288 --> 00:54:11,790
-[Eun-ji] Short?
-[Car] What is this?

1346
00:54:11,873 --> 00:54:15,168
Something like, "We're officially
a couple starting today?"

1347
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:18,254
I don't think anyone here
has had that before.

1348
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:19,297
Oh. Oh, really?

1349
00:54:20,465 --> 00:54:21,299
I was…

1350
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:22,968
[curious music playing]

1351
00:54:23,551 --> 00:54:26,346
…actually in a relationship
for about 100 days.

1352
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:28,014
…for about 100 days.

1353
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:29,307
That's a long time.

1354
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:30,892
-Pretty long.
-[Seung-chan] Oh, it's…

1355
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:33,269
-[Car and Han-na exclaim]
-[Eun-ji] Oh, this is…

1356
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:35,563
-He has the most experience.
-[Car] He's dated before.

1357
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:37,524
-[Eun-ji] Then he's totally--
-That's right.

1358
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:39,985
Oh, that's why you're the game changer.

1359
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:42,570
Then you don't qualify
for Eternal Single Land.

1360
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:44,280
-[Min-hong] Huh, can't relate.
-I know.

1361
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:47,117
With zero days of experience,
that sounds pretty long.

1362
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,159
I know. [chuckles]

1363
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:49,786
[low gripping music playing]

1364
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:51,413
I'm 31 years old,

1365
00:54:51,496 --> 00:54:55,125
so 100 days is less than 1% of my life.

1366
00:54:55,917 --> 00:54:58,545
So it's awkward to say
that I've dated before,

1367
00:54:58,628 --> 00:55:02,048
and my friends treat me like
I have been single since birth anyway.

1368
00:55:02,674 --> 00:55:05,343
So I think I am an eternal single too.

1369
00:55:06,344 --> 00:55:07,971
[Eun-ji] "The 100-day game changer."

1370
00:55:08,054 --> 00:55:10,974
God, why is it so funny
they call him the game changer?

1371
00:55:13,727 --> 00:55:15,645
[Do] I was really surprised.

1372
00:55:16,521 --> 00:55:20,734
I thought, "Wow, he seems so smooth."

1373
00:55:21,776 --> 00:55:24,070
"He looks relaxed."

1374
00:55:24,946 --> 00:55:26,990
[Jeong-mok] I think he bothered me a bit.

1375
00:55:27,073 --> 00:55:30,535
I thought, "A normal guy
seems to have joined us."

1376
00:55:30,618 --> 00:55:32,495
"Will I be able to compete against him?"

1377
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:33,997
[Car and Han-na] "A normal guy."

1378
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:36,458
-The… The game changer… The…
-[Min-hong] The game changer.

1379
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:39,044
-[Hyun-kyu] He is the game changer.
-[Car] They're going crazy.

1380
00:55:39,127 --> 00:55:41,838
Supposed to shake things up,
but is there even a game right now?

1381
00:55:41,921 --> 00:55:44,215
Right. He showed up
way, way, way too early.

1382
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:46,342
-[Ji-su] Right.
-[Sang-ho] So flashy.

1383
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:48,678
[Hyun-kyu] He showed up
even before we started the game.

1384
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:50,221
With 100 days of experience,

1385
00:55:50,305 --> 00:55:53,391
we'd just consider him single since birth,
but here, he's a total pro.

1386
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:56,144
-[Han-na] Right. Right.
-For us, he's a seasoned veteran.

1387
00:55:56,227 --> 00:55:57,937
Here, he's practically a pickup artist.

1388
00:55:58,021 --> 00:55:59,105
[Car] That's right.

1389
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:02,859
And actually, today's date
was really frustrating

1390
00:56:02,942 --> 00:56:04,944
-and they weren't very satisfied.
-Yeah.

1391
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:06,613
But Seung-chan shows up

1392
00:56:06,696 --> 00:56:08,948
-with 100 days of experience…
-A man with experience.

1393
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:10,158
…and leads the conversation.

1394
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:11,576
He's pretty much a pickup artist.

1395
00:56:11,659 --> 00:56:13,328
Honestly, Ji-su said something

1396
00:56:13,411 --> 00:56:15,872
-that might hurt the guys' pride.
-What did she say?

1397
00:56:15,955 --> 00:56:17,207
"He came to shake up the game,

1398
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:19,084
-but there is no game."
-[Cupids] Ah.

1399
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:22,212
[Car] This should hurt their pride,
but these guys don't even know that.

1400
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:23,213
-They don't know.
-No.

1401
00:56:23,296 --> 00:56:24,672
They don't know what she's saying.

1402
00:56:24,756 --> 00:56:27,258
"A normal guy is here."
That's what they're saying.

1403
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:28,510
[exclaims]

1404
00:56:28,593 --> 00:56:30,136
What was the first question again?

1405
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,846
Why have you been single since birth?

1406
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:33,681
Why have I been single since birth?

1407
00:56:33,765 --> 00:56:35,183
I didn't know this,

1408
00:56:35,266 --> 00:56:37,936
but when I was getting
my makeover for the show,

1409
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:41,940
I guess I was dressing
in a way that didn't really suit me.

1410
00:56:43,108 --> 00:56:45,026
[mellow whimsical music playing]

1411
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:48,446
-Oh, is that Seung-chan?
-[Han-na] His outfit is so…

1412
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:51,866
I'm Lee Seung-chan,
and I've been single for 31 years.

1413
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:52,992
[Eun-ji] So…

1414
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:55,495
-But why…
-He should've touched up his roots.

1415
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:58,289
He had a totally different vibe.

1416
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:01,084
INTERVIEW WITH PRODUCERS

1417
00:57:01,167 --> 00:57:02,210
Hello. [chuckles]

1418
00:57:02,293 --> 00:57:03,128
[staff] Hello.

1419
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:05,630
Don't I look okay with bleached hair?

1420
00:57:05,713 --> 00:57:07,882
-[crew laughs]
-[chuckles]

1421
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:12,095
[Seung-chan] Well, I thought my hair
looked cool and I was satisfied with it,

1422
00:57:12,178 --> 00:57:14,681
but the people around me kept saying,

1423
00:57:14,764 --> 00:57:16,850
"That's why you don't have a girlfriend."

1424
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:20,687
The flower-patterned shirts too.

1425
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:22,355
I thought I was wearing cool clothes,

1426
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:25,942
but it's kind of upsetting
when people don't understand my style.

1427
00:57:26,734 --> 00:57:29,988
For his haircut, I think he should have
a neat two-block cut.

1428
00:57:30,071 --> 00:57:31,281
-You know?
-[hairstylist] Okay.

1429
00:57:31,364 --> 00:57:34,159
With a dark color
and slightly longer in the back.

1430
00:57:34,242 --> 00:57:35,952
-About his eyebrows…
-[makeup artist] Okay.

1431
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:38,079
How about extending the tail a bit?

1432
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:39,456
-[makeup artist] Then…
-Yeah.

1433
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:41,374
That looks like a good fit for you, right?

1434
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:43,835
The shoulders too.
Bring them down a little.

1435
00:57:43,918 --> 00:57:45,336
-There you go.
-[stylist] Yeah.

1436
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:47,213
[In-guk] So it looks more natural. Yeah.

1437
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:50,592
[Seung-chan] Wow.
Even I think I look okay now.

1438
00:57:50,675 --> 00:57:51,718
[chuckles]

1439
00:57:52,385 --> 00:57:53,720
[Eun-ji exclaiming in awe]

1440
00:57:54,804 --> 00:57:58,933
[Han-na] Goodness, Seung-chan looks like
a totally different person.

1441
00:57:59,017 --> 00:57:59,976
Wow.

1442
00:58:00,894 --> 00:58:01,728
[music fades]

1443
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:03,730
-It's like white hair…
-[cell phone chimes]

1444
00:58:04,856 --> 00:58:07,192
TONIGHT, THE MEN WILL REVEAL
THEIR INFORMATION

1445
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:09,944
The male eternal singles
will reveal their information.

1446
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:11,946
THE MEN WILL SHARE THEIR AGES AND JOBS

1447
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:14,449
[Sang-ho] Wait,
is it supposed to go this fast?

1448
00:58:14,532 --> 00:58:16,117
-Our ages, already?
-[Hyun-kyu] Usually…

1449
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:18,578
-I'm so curious.
-[Min-hong] But I am really curious.

1450
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:21,581
[Hyun-kyu] It's similar, but as soon as
you got here, you have to reveal…

1451
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:23,416
[Car] Oh, their ages and jobs. Okay.

1452
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:26,002
Then, just the guys? Oh, my.

1453
00:58:26,085 --> 00:58:27,629
MALE ETERNAL SINGLES' NIGHT

1454
00:58:27,712 --> 00:58:28,755
[Do] Then,

1455
00:58:29,422 --> 00:58:31,049
starting with Hyun-kyu.

1456
00:58:31,132 --> 00:58:32,467
Your age and job.

1457
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:35,220
Okay, I was born in 1999.

1458
00:58:35,303 --> 00:58:37,138
[contestants exclaim]

1459
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:39,015
I'm 26.

1460
00:58:39,098 --> 00:58:40,266
So…

1461
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:41,809
And my job…

1462
00:58:44,437 --> 00:58:45,855
I'm still a student.

1463
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:47,398
I'm in medical school.

1464
00:58:47,482 --> 00:58:48,858
[contestants exclaim]

1465
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:51,778
-I'm in medical school.
-[gasps]

1466
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:53,404
[quirky music playing]

1467
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:54,322
[exclaims]

1468
00:58:56,115 --> 00:58:58,034
They're reacting
to the fact he's in med school.

1469
00:58:58,117 --> 00:59:00,870
-Yeah, they're all quite surprised.
-[Eun-ji] Yeah, really surprised.

1470
00:59:00,954 --> 00:59:02,497
[Car] He's quite the competitor.

1471
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:06,501
[Seung-chan] I'm in my final year
of med school now.

1472
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:09,546
-Right.
-[chuckles]

1473
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:12,131
-[Seung-li] Med school. Wow.
-[Do] I was close.

1474
00:59:12,215 --> 00:59:13,758
Which specialty do you want to do?

1475
00:59:13,841 --> 00:59:16,886
I want to go into orthopedic surgery,
but I'm not sure yet.

1476
00:59:17,428 --> 00:59:19,556
I have to do my internship too, so…

1477
00:59:21,015 --> 00:59:23,476
Now, you can ask someone
you were curious about.

1478
00:59:24,727 --> 00:59:25,645
Then, Jae-yun?

1479
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:26,563
[Sang-ho] Hmm.

1480
00:59:26,646 --> 00:59:29,107
Oh, should I address him with honorifics?
Is he older than me?

1481
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:30,608
[Sang-ho] You don't know that yet.

1482
00:59:30,692 --> 00:59:32,151
[Jae-yun] I was…

1483
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:34,320
born in 1998. I'm 27.

1484
00:59:34,404 --> 00:59:35,863
Oh, one year apart.

[male contestant exclaims]

1486
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:39,659
-And your job?
-[Sang-ho] I think he's…

1487
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:40,994
My job…

1488
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:43,162
I'm a 3D artist.

1489
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:44,330
[contestants exclaim]

1490
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:47,792
[Jae-yun] And I've been working
in the computer graphics industry.

1491
00:59:49,210 --> 00:59:51,045
[Car] Ji-yeon only has her eyes
on Jae-yun.

1492
00:59:51,129 --> 00:59:53,047
-[Eun-ji] Yeah.
-[Han-na] She seems to like him.

1493
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:55,842
[Jeong-mok] He's still
a year older than me.

1494
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:58,344
-[Sang-ho] Oh, man.
-[Seung-li] I wanted to say beforehand.

1495
00:59:58,428 --> 00:59:59,429
-I am…
-[Sang-ho] And me?

1496
00:59:59,512 --> 01:00:00,805
-An athlete.
-An athlete.

1497
01:00:00,888 --> 01:00:02,015
You're an athlete, right?

1498
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:05,351
[Hyun-kyu] You look like
an athlete or coach.

1499
01:00:05,435 --> 01:00:06,978
-Right or wrong?
-[Seung-li] A coach?

1500
01:00:07,061 --> 01:00:08,438
A kinesiology major.

1501
01:00:08,521 --> 01:00:10,398
-Can I just tell you?
-Yeah.

1502
01:00:10,481 --> 01:00:11,316
[Hyun-kyu] Yes.

1503
01:00:11,399 --> 01:00:14,235
I'm the same age as you. We're twins.

1504
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:16,362
-I was born in 1998.
-[Seung-chan] Both 1998.

1505
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:18,406
[Seung-li] I was born in 1998,

1506
01:00:19,741 --> 01:00:21,868
and I'm working as a marketer now.

1507
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:23,369
[Eun-ji exclaims]

1508
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:25,455
A marketer.

1509
01:00:26,164 --> 01:00:27,832
He can speak four languages.

1510
01:00:27,915 --> 01:00:30,460
Wow! Oh, that's kind of unexpected
but cool.

1511
01:00:30,543 --> 01:00:31,794
[upbeat music playing]

1512
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:34,756
[Seung-li] I usually deal
with international marketing.

1513
01:00:35,506 --> 01:00:39,260
I recorded some videos about Brazil
because I can speak Portuguese.

1514
01:00:39,344 --> 01:00:41,596
You should talk with my stylist.

1515
01:00:41,679 --> 01:00:44,015
I recorded some videos, they're on TikTok.

1516
01:00:44,098 --> 01:00:46,768
I have experience
working at Amazon and Naver,

1517
01:00:46,851 --> 01:00:48,603
and I help with all aspects,

1518
01:00:48,686 --> 01:00:51,564
including video production
and visual analysis.

1519

[applause]

1523
01:00:58,738 --> 01:00:59,697
So you were all wrong.

1524
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:02,325
[Hyun-kyu] Wow, it's been a while.

1525
01:01:02,408 --> 01:01:03,868
-[Ji-su] Pick someone.
-Pick someone.

1526
01:01:03,951 --> 01:01:05,328
[inhales deeply]

1527
01:01:05,411 --> 01:01:07,747
-[laughter]
-Wasn't I… Wasn't I the last one?

1528
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:10,583
You're 25, 26.

1529
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,669
[low whimsical music playing]

1530
01:01:14,253 --> 01:01:15,588
I am, uh…

1531
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:18,424
-Thought he'd definitely be older than me.
-It'll all come back.

1532
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:20,301
No, I was just guessing…

1533
01:01:20,385 --> 01:01:23,763
Actually, I thought
Sang-ho would be a bit older.

1534
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:27,517
"Is he about 30 years old?"
But then, while we were on our date,

1535
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:30,228
I thought he seemed a little awkward

1536
01:01:30,311 --> 01:01:33,147
and that he might
actually be younger than me.

1537
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,109
So, about 26?

1538
01:01:36,192 --> 01:01:38,319
-[Sang-ho and Hyun-kyu chuckle]
-[Ji-su] Tell us.

1539
01:01:38,403 --> 01:01:39,862
Oh, I was born in 1998.

1540
01:01:40,488 --> 01:01:43,658
-[Ji-yeon] Oh, all three of you.
-Three of us are twins. That's great.

1541
01:01:43,741 --> 01:01:45,118
[Sang-ho] And my job is…

1542
01:01:45,868 --> 01:01:49,205
Well, I'm a researcher
in the defense industry.

1543
01:01:49,288 --> 01:01:51,416
-I do research for a munitions company.
-Oh.

[rock music playing]

1545
01:01:53,084 --> 01:01:54,335
[Seung-li] A researcher?

1546
01:01:55,044 --> 01:01:57,255
The work I do is research
on testing equipment

1547
01:01:57,338 --> 01:01:59,257
for the electrical parts
that go into weapons

1548
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:01,718
such as tanks
and self-propelled artillery.

1549
01:02:02,885 --> 01:02:05,138

on test equipment.

Are you perhaps

1554
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:13,354
a Hanwha Eagles fan?

1555

-[laughter]
-[light music playing]

1556
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:17,275
Oh, I don't really
know much about baseball…

1557
01:02:17,358 --> 01:02:20,236
-[Seung-chan] That's awesome.
-…but I am sort of related to the team.

1560
01:02:23,364 --> 01:02:24,907
[Seung-li] All right, another 1998.

1561
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:26,492
That means…

1562
01:02:27,285 --> 01:02:28,494
It's your turn now.

1563
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:31,622
-I really can't tell.
-[Seung-li] Just tell us.

1564
01:02:31,706 --> 01:02:32,832
A grad student.

1565
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:34,792
Accounting? Is that your field?

1566
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:36,461
-Accounting?
-[Hyun-kyu] That field.

1567
01:02:37,044 --> 01:02:40,256
-Accounting or in that field.
-I was, yes, born in 1999.

1571
01:02:46,888 --> 01:02:49,891
Yeah, I'm studying chemical
and biomolecular engineering.

1572
01:02:49,974 --> 01:02:51,851
-You're an engineering major.
-[Sang-ho] Cool.

1573
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:54,520
[Jeong-mok] I'm currently
a college student.

1574
01:02:54,604 --> 01:02:58,024
I'm studying biochemical engineering
at Sogang University.

1575
01:02:58,649 --> 01:03:01,486
I just attend lectures
and go to the library to study

1576
01:03:01,569 --> 01:03:02,653
when I have free periods,

1577
01:03:02,737 --> 01:03:05,865
do my assignments if I have them,
and end my day like that.

Can I ask you what year you're in?

1580
01:03:11,829 --> 01:03:13,706
I was in the military academy before.

1581
01:03:14,415 --> 01:03:16,667
-Which branch of the military?
-[Seung-chan] Air force?

1582
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:17,710
The air force.

1583
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:19,712
Oh, that's cool.

1584
01:03:20,296 --> 01:03:21,672
I'm in my third year now.

1585
01:03:23,508 --> 01:03:24,759
[mellow music playing]

1586
01:03:24,842 --> 01:03:27,303
[Min-hong] I had a feeling
he was younger than me.

1587
01:03:28,012 --> 01:03:30,807
I actually don't prefer younger guys

1588
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:33,893
and had no plans of dating young guys,

1589
01:03:33,976 --> 01:03:35,812
but when I saw Jeong-mok…

1590
01:03:35,895 --> 01:03:36,896
Uh…

1591
01:03:38,022 --> 01:03:42,068
I thought, "Maybe age isn't so important."

1592
01:03:42,151 --> 01:03:44,904
He changed my views a bit, so…

1593
01:03:44,987 --> 01:03:46,781
I thought he was interesting.

1594
01:03:46,864 --> 01:03:48,533

-[Hyun-kyu] Wow, fascinating.
-You're the last one.

1597
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:55,164
Oh, I'm…

1598
01:03:56,457 --> 01:03:57,959
I'm the oldest guy. [chuckles]

1599
01:03:58,042 --> 01:03:59,627
-Oh, really?
-[Seung-chan] I'm…

1600
01:04:00,461 --> 01:04:01,420
31 years old.

1601
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:03,047
-Oh.
-Oh, you… You look so young.

1602
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:04,507
[Seung-chan] I was born in 1994.

1603
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:07,677
-[Sang-ho] 1994?
-And my job is…

[low intriguing music playing]

1605
01:04:10,638 --> 01:04:12,265

1608
01:04:15,393 --> 01:04:17,478
-[Han-na gasps] A doctor?
-[Car] A surgeon?

1609
01:04:18,145 --> 01:04:18,980
Wow.

1610
01:04:19,063 --> 01:04:21,190
He's a doctor.
But he was wearing those clothes

1611
01:04:21,274 --> 01:04:23,150
-and had that hair back then.
-[Han-na] Right.

1612
01:04:23,234 --> 01:04:25,486
-The Hawaiian shirt.
-He didn't like that.

1613
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:27,238
He didn't wanna be like, "I'm a doctor…"

1614
01:04:27,321 --> 01:04:30,533
-[In-guk] Having to look put together.
-He didn't wanna fit into that mold.

1615
01:04:30,616 --> 01:04:32,201
-Now I get it. Makes sense.
-[Car] Okay.

1616
01:04:35,621 --> 01:04:37,039
[Seung-chan] I'm a surgeon.

1617
01:04:38,833 --> 01:04:41,961
I graduated from
Korea University's medical school

1618
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:45,464
and I trained in Samsung Hospital's
surgical department.

1619
01:04:45,548 --> 01:04:48,217
Surgery itself is a very dynamic process,

1620
01:04:48,301 --> 01:04:51,804
and getting to see patients
make a full recovery is so rewarding.

You're all babies.

[laughter]

1626
01:05:03,357 --> 01:05:05,651
It's like you know everything about me.

1627
01:05:05,735 --> 01:05:09,113
Well, at first, they said
you were a med student, so I…

1628
01:05:10,448 --> 01:05:13,326
They started with med student
and ended with doctor, cruel.

1629
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:14,535

[light whimsical music playing]

1631
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:18,205
[Hyun-kyu] I was so surprised
to learn his age,

1632
01:05:18,289 --> 01:05:20,666
and I was even more surprised
about his job.

1633
01:05:21,375 --> 01:05:23,753
I'm aspiring to be a doctor,
but he's a real doctor.

1634
01:05:23,836 --> 01:05:26,380
It was like, "Oh, you're a med student?
Well, I'm a doctor."

1635
01:05:26,464 --> 01:05:27,423
That was rough.

1636
01:05:29,342 --> 01:05:31,969
[Seung-li] The most impressive people
were the two doctors

1637
01:05:32,053 --> 01:05:34,055
because they have important jobs.

1638
01:05:34,138 --> 01:05:36,015
They could be a serious competition.

1639
01:05:37,391 --> 01:05:41,062
[Jeong-mok] A sense of inferiority?
I couldn't help but feel that way,

1640
01:05:41,145 --> 01:05:42,438
hearing about their jobs.

1641
01:05:42,521 --> 01:05:44,523
"Oh, how could I ever outdo him?"

1642
01:05:45,107 --> 01:05:46,317
"I don't think I can."

1643
01:05:47,234 --> 01:05:48,152
Like…

1644
01:05:49,153 --> 01:05:50,571
What if we both like Yi Do?

1645
01:05:51,864 --> 01:05:53,115
[chuckles softly]

1646
01:05:53,699 --> 01:05:56,410
[Jae-yun] As we started
revealing things about each other,

1647
01:05:56,494 --> 01:05:58,371
my confidence kept dropping.

1648
01:05:58,454 --> 01:06:00,873
There was a medical school student
and a doctor.

1649
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:02,792
I just felt so small, like…

1650
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:04,210
I'm nothing.

1651
01:06:05,086 --> 01:06:07,338
-Oh, I was really way off then.
-I know.

1652
01:06:07,421 --> 01:06:09,840
-I thought everyone was in their thirties.
-Me too.

1653
01:06:09,924 --> 01:06:11,467
[Do] It's your five o'clock shadow.

1654
01:06:11,550 --> 01:06:12,843
-Wait. What?
-[Do] My bad.

1655
01:06:14,178 --> 01:06:15,262
[Seung-chan] Hold on.

[gripping electronic music playing]

1657
01:06:24,355 --> 01:06:25,606
I'm the only one?

1658
01:06:27,316 --> 01:06:29,485
[In-guk] Oh, only Seung-chan got it?

1659
01:06:30,444 --> 01:06:31,737
To pick the first impression.

1660
01:06:31,821 --> 01:06:34,281
[Sang-ho and Hyun-kyu]
Oh, the first impression pick.

1661
01:06:34,365 --> 01:06:35,658
[Ji-su] Oh, we all did that.

1662
01:06:36,283 --> 01:06:38,577
Oh, you did? Okay. Bye.

1663
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:39,912

[indistinct chatter]

1665
01:06:44,667 --> 01:06:47,294
-Where do I go?
-[Sang-ho] Yeah, go to the igloo.

1666
01:06:47,378 --> 01:06:49,088
[Hyun-kyu] Where are you supposed to go?

1667
01:06:49,171 --> 01:06:50,589
They said to go inside.

1668
01:06:51,298 --> 01:06:52,717
[Sang-ho] Must have changed.

1669
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:53,926
[Hyun-kyu] What? Just…

1670
01:06:54,885 --> 01:06:56,220
Hey, where is he going?

1671
01:06:56,303 --> 01:06:57,138
[Hyun-kyu] There.

1672
01:06:57,221 --> 01:06:59,390
-Doing it somewhere hidden.
-[Sang-ho] Interesting.

01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:02,476
[music fades]

1674
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:05,062

Hello?

Wow!

1679
01:07:22,913 --> 01:07:23,873
[Car] What is this?

1680
01:07:23,956 --> 01:07:25,166
[Han-na and Car] What is this?

1681
01:07:25,249 --> 01:07:26,751
THE SUITE

1682
01:07:26,834 --> 01:07:27,918
[Han-na] What is this room?

1683
01:07:28,002 --> 01:07:31,505
[Car] "A private area where you can be
alone with some of the opposite sex?"

1684
01:07:35,509 --> 01:07:38,054
-Right away? Seriously?
-[Han-na] They get a room like that?

1685
01:07:38,137 --> 01:07:40,389
EMPTY
IN USE

1686
01:07:40,973 --> 01:07:43,976
Oh, no. They…
They're gonna pass out from pure shock.

1687
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:46,312
-Time-out.
-[Han-na] Is this Too Hot to Handle?

1688
01:07:46,395 --> 01:07:47,897
-They'll pass out.
-They're not ready.

1689
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:50,858
-This isn't Too Hot to Handle, right?
-No, our kids will be shocked.

1690
01:07:50,941 --> 01:07:52,276
We're getting them a room?

1691
01:07:52,359 --> 01:07:53,944
-We can't do this.
-[Eun-ji] Seriously.

1692
01:07:54,028 --> 01:07:56,155
-They won't be able to sleep.
-They can't handle it.

1693
01:07:56,238 --> 01:07:58,699
-Please don't do this.
-[Eun-ji] They'll descend into chaos.

[mellow music playing]

1696
01:08:11,003 --> 01:08:13,130
YOU MAY HAVE ONE-ON-ONE CHATS
WITH TWO WOMEN YOU LIKE

1697
01:08:13,214 --> 01:08:14,048
Twenty minutes?

1698

-[Car] With two girls.
-[Han-na] One-on-one?

1699
01:08:15,966 --> 01:08:17,927
Wow. Which two will he choose?

[music fades]

1704
01:08:44,537 --> 01:08:47,414
[Min-hong] It feels awkward,
talking so casually.

1705
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:56,632
-[Hyun-kyu] Huh?
-[Jeong-mok] Not me. Me?

1709
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:04,682
-[Sang-ho] Is it the second vote?
-[Jeong-mok] Wait. Already?

1710
01:09:09,895 --> 01:09:12,022
Wait, wait.
Is it a different kind of vote today?

1711
01:09:13,983 --> 01:09:15,442
[Min-hong] We're voting tomorrow?

1712
01:09:15,526 --> 01:09:17,486
Oh, it's the selection date now?

1713
01:09:19,697 --> 01:09:20,823
[sighs heavily]

1714
01:09:25,327 --> 01:09:28,247

-Hey. [chuckles]
-Hi.

1719
01:09:56,275 --> 01:09:57,902
[Hyun-kyu] So he picked her, then?

1720
01:09:57,985 --> 01:10:00,529
-[Sang-ho] Oh, that's right.
-[Hyun-kyu] They gave him a chance.

1721
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:02,406
-[Seung-li] You're right.

Oh, why do I…

1727
01:10:17,004 --> 01:10:18,464
What is your ideal type?

1728
01:10:18,547 --> 01:10:21,217
Me? Someone with a nice smile?

1729
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:24,595
-Oh, I see. That's why you picked me, huh?
-[both laugh]

1730
01:10:26,889 --> 01:10:29,600
[Jae-yun] I was a little nervous.
I definitely got worried.

01:10:30,142 --> 01:10:30,976
[cell phone chimes]

1732
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:34,230

Hello.

[Jeong-mok] I suddenly felt
really nervous.

Do and I never got to connect.

1739
01:10:51,372 --> 01:10:53,374
[Jeong-mok] I was here for a day longer,

1740
01:10:53,457 --> 01:10:55,376
but I didn't get any chances.

1741
01:10:56,001 --> 01:10:57,836
I wish I'd gotten a chance first.
