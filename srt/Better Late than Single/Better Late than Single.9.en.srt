1
00:00:08,341 --> 00:00:09,676
[Jeong-mok] Hmm.

2
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:12,929
Well, actually, I'm sure.

3
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,348
-I probably sound crazy. Do I?
-No, tell me.

4
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,600
-I don't? Really?
-Tell me. Tell me.

5
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:20,478
I just thought,

6
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:23,106
-"I think I'm gonna marry her."
-Really?

7
00:00:25,191 --> 00:00:27,694
I just had that thought, all of a sudden.

8
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:29,571
I don't really know why.

9
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:31,239
[gentle music playing]

10
00:00:31,322 --> 00:00:32,323
I mean, I…

11
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:33,533
[inhales sharply]

12
00:00:33,616 --> 00:00:35,660
I can't really explain, I just…

13
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:39,205
I was like,
"Should I tell her this or not?"

14
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:41,291
I kept going over it in my head.

15
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:43,209
I decided,
"I should tell her when I'm sure."

16
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:44,377
Mmm.

17
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:45,879
That's what I decided.

18
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:50,383
So, to be completely honest,
as of right now…

19
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:53,136
I think you're the one.

20
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:57,640
[romantic music playing]

21
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:01,936
[Ji-yeon] Yesterday,

22
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:06,399
I was thinking, like,
"Huh? What's going on here?"

23
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:10,445
But today, he really assured me
when he told me, "I think you're the one."

24
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:13,656
I was kind of surprised.

25
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:15,575
Mmm.

26
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:17,535
Talking to him in the Suite,

27
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,455
I was getting so nervous.

28
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:21,581
[chuckles softly]

29
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,878
As of now… I feel the same. [chuckles]

30
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:29,255
-[Han-na] Ji-yeon likes him back!
-[Eun-ji] Oh, my gosh!

31
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:30,840
[Han-na] It's done. They're a couple.

32
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:32,842
-But…
-Hmm?

33
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:34,427
I feel…

34
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:38,056
YOUR DATE IN THE SUITE HAS ENDED

35
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:39,265
[cell phone chimes]

36
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:41,976
If we leave here together…

37
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,103
-Wait…
-I think we definitely should.

38
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:45,146
[Ji-yeon] Really?

39
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,481
-[door lock beeps]
-[door opens]

40
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:48,566
JEONG-MOK WAS HERE

41
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:51,110
Wow! Look at these two. This is great.

42
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:53,446
-Whoa, I got chills.
-[Han-na and Eun-ji] Yeah.

43
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:55,448
[In-guk] That was incredible.
When he said,

44
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:58,076
-"This might sound crazy, but I…
-[Han-na] Right?

45
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,078
-…wanna marry you."
-Exactly.

46
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:02,539
How'd he go from being an eternal single

47
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,457
-to thinking about marriage?
-Yeah, seriously.

48
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,876
We were all kind of surprised
when Jeong-mok started

49
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,087
-to feel that way about Ji-yeon.
-Exactly.

50
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,673
-Right.
-But, you know, love is never predictable.

51
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:12,841
[Eun-ji and Car] Mmm.

52
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:17,804
[Min-hong] I'm just feeling upset
about this right now.

53
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:19,681
Honestly, I'm really upset.

54
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:22,642
Like, I'm not even…

55
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:26,396
I'm not even Jeong-mok's second choice.
I'm probably third.

56
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:30,692
There's Do, and then he developed a crush
on someone else overnight.

57
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:32,235
[Ji-su] Who?

58
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:33,486
[Min-hong] Ji-yeon.

59
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,655
-[Ji-su] What?
-[Min-hong] So… [scoffs]

60
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:37,157
Nobody expected that.

61
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,869
The others are surprised
because his feelings suddenly shifted.

62
00:02:40,952 --> 00:02:45,165
Like, yesterday, Jeong-mok tried to leave
in the middle of a conversation.

63
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:49,586
It seemed like… [chuckles]
It seemed like he was about to cry.

64
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,045
He was tearing up.

65
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,550
[Ji-yeon] So, okay, so my mom
raised my brother and me.

66
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:58,428
She was the only one who took care of us.

67
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,889
My dad has always been
a really troubled person…

68
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:02,974
-[Min-hong] Yeah.
-…and he beat us a lot.

69
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:05,059
[soft somber music playing]

70
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:09,522
And that's why I avoid men.

71
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:12,025
I'm living a much better life now,

72
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:13,693
-so it's okay.
-[Min-hong] Mm-hmm.

73
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:20,575
Where are you going?

74
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:21,951
-Are you okay?
-[Jeong-mok] What?

75
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,414
[somber music continues]

76
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:37,091
I'm not sure
if that's when his feelings changed,

77
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:38,760
or if it was something else.

78
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:41,888
I mean, I don't understand
what's going on right now.

79
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:43,473
Yeah, I saw that he was tearing up.

80
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,767
It's understandable
that he would get emotional, but--

81
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:47,560
Jeong-mok is a crybaby.

82
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,396
[Min-hong] Yeah,
so now I'm his third choice.

83
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,357
I'm not even under consideration.

84
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,610
But earlier, just over there,
he said he had feelings for me.

85
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:57,153
Oh, he said that?

86
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:58,655
8 HOURS EARLIER

87
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,114
-So, uh…
-[Jeong-mok] Yeah?

88
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:03,868
-We have three or four days left, right?
-Right.

89
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,453
-Am I, um…
-Hmm?

90
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:08,498
-Am I even in the running, at this point?
-Hmm.

91
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,500
Are you even considering me?

92
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:12,877
I am considering you.

93
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:17,382
To be honest,
I don't even know how I feel.

94
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:20,593
I just… don't know what to do anymore.

95
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,429
[Han-na] He was a little vague with her.

96
00:04:23,513 --> 00:04:24,722
[tense music playing]

97
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,392
Is it possible
you won't know today, tomorrow,

98
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:28,893
-or even the day after?
-Uh…

99
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:33,523
I don't know when…
uh, when I'll know for sure.

100
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:38,027
-But don't you need to decide?
-Yeah, I do.

101
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:47,370
Honestly, if I'm his number three,
he should just tell me.

102
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:51,708
I wonder what his problem is
and why he can't be honest with me.

103
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:55,044
I mean, right now I'm asking myself, like,

104
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,130
"Oh, does he just want me
as another backup?"

105
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:58,047
Exactly.

106
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:01,092
I also think he's saying to himself, like,

107
00:05:01,175 --> 00:05:04,637
-"Oh, I have several girls…"
-His… his ego is so inflated right now.

108
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:06,556
[all laughing]

109
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,309
-They're starting to get a little angry.
-[Car] Right.

110
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,978
His ego is so inflated right now.

111
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:14,230
Do you know what he said to me
when I asked him out?

112
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:17,191
He's like,
"You're someone's precious daughter…"

113
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:19,277
SECRET DATE

114
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,361
[Yeo-myung chuckles]

115
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,447
Someone's precious daughter…

116
00:05:23,072 --> 00:05:24,198
[laughs]

117
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:26,200
[amusing music playing]

118
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:28,119
I'm so annoyed, seriously.

119
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:30,204
-[Min-hong] What, is he crazy?
-[Yeo-myung squeals]

120
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:34,292
Am I just a backup?

121
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:37,128
[inhales] 'Cause I don't wanna be.

122
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:39,756
[Han-na] Oh, no.

123
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,758
-You're not a backup.
-[Han-na] Yeah.

124
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:46,137
It's true that Jeong-mok should be
more clear about where he stands,

125
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,639
but he's just not good at doing that yet.

126
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:50,141
-Right.
-He can't reject someone,

127
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:51,601
-he just feels too bad.
-Yeah.

128
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,978
But for Min-hong,
who is waiting for answers,

129
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:56,689
it's really hurtful.
And he's just hurting her more and more.

130
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,775
-I'm sure he didn't mean to.
-[Han-na] Of course.

131
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:01,069
I'm sure that he doesn't have
bad intentions here.

132
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:04,739
I'd like Jeong-mok to start
being more up-front with them now.

133
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:07,784
Yeah, I think he'll have to.
He needs to start doing that.

134
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,286
[insects trilling]

135
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:12,914
-What should we do tomorrow?
-Why?

136
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:14,373
Well… [chuckles]

137
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:17,460
Today… today was a little intense.

138
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:18,836
[both chuckle]

139
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:23,049
[Ji-yeon] I'm glad that we confessed
how we feel about each other.

140
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:27,762
I just don't know how to tell
the other girls about this.

141
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:33,184
I've been listening to them talk about
their feelings for Jeong-mok

142
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:34,685
this whole time.

143
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,730
And now, after all that… [chuckles softly]

144
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:42,026
…I don't know how to tell them
about my feelings for him.

145
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:45,571
So, yeah, I've been
thinking about this a lot.

146
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,912
-[Jeong-mok] Are you worried?
-About what?

147
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:55,790
I mean, are you worried about the others?

148
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:58,334
-It's okay.
-What's to worry about?

149
00:06:58,417 --> 00:06:59,293
Right.

150
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,379
Just focus on us.

151
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:09,595
-[Ji-yeon] So…
-Mmm?

152
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:12,223
-After we leave here…
-Mm-hmm?

153
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:14,308
Would you want to…

154
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:17,728
keep seeing me?
Like, keep in touch, or… [inhales]

155
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:19,647
date me?

156
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:22,733
Mmm. [chuckles]
Oh, we haven't talked about this yet,

157
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:23,860
-have we?
-No.

158
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:27,530
Well… I came here…

159
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,158
-because I wanted to find…
-Mmm.

160
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,118
-…a long-term partner.
-Mm-hmm.

161
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:35,121
Is that me? [chuckles]

162
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:37,832
That's you.

163
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,127
[enchanting music playing]

164
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,925
What should I do? [chuckles]

165
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:50,261
[chuckles softly]

166
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:52,972
-Why do you keep smiling?
-What? Just…

167
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:55,892
-Just because.
-Okay.

168
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,021
[Jeong-mok] While we were talking,

169
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:04,066
I just kept thinking,
"It's so easy to talk to her."

170
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:06,027
Your strength.

171
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,153
-Strength. Okay.
-Strength?

172
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:10,740
I'm confident I could make it,
even on a deserted island. [chuckles]

173
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,201
[Seung-li] Oh, that's similar. Okay.

174
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:17,371
My first priority
has always been my family.

175
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:20,333
That I should
take care of them any way I can.

176
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,793
I never really lived my own life.

177
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:25,296
[Jeong-mok] So, for me, in my life,

178
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:28,299
my family is my top priority.

179
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,511
-You should come by my studio.
-I totally will.

180
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:34,013
I actually wanted to do music.

181
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:35,056
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

182
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:36,974
-My parents were against it.
-Right.

183
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,519
-"Do it when you're in college."
-Mmm.

184
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:42,063
But when I got to college,
I couldn't do it there.

185
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:43,648
Right, right.

186
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:46,234
I totally understand
because my parents were against it too.

187
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,151
Yeah, exactly.

188
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:50,196
I didn't really have hobbies
since I worked part-time. [chuckles]

189
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,907
You have such a strong will, seriously.

190
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,368
That was how I became so self-sufficient.

191
00:08:56,869 --> 00:09:01,541
[Jeong-mok] I think our values
and the general environment we grew up in

192
00:09:01,624 --> 00:09:03,292
are actually pretty similar.

193
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:08,506
I really get the sense
that she's a very… independent person.

194
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:12,885
They have lots in common, don't they?

195
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,304
They're similar,
so they can relate to each other.

196
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,515
-That was the deciding factor.
-[Han-na] Oh, yeah.

197
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:18,516
It helped him choose

198
00:09:18,599 --> 00:09:21,561
-between Do and Ji-yeon.
-[Han-na] It clarified things.

199
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:24,230
You… you know I said, uh…

200
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:26,524
"If I have a daughter,

201
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:31,862
I want her to be a pure,
beautiful person, just like you."

202
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,156
I mean… [inhales]

203
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,409
You turned out really well.

204
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:39,912
Impressively. [chuckles softly]

205
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,002
[music ends]

206
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,336
In my testimonial…

207
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,463
-Mm-hmm.
-…I was asked this one question.

208
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:50,506
What?

209
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,551
Like, "When did you first
start liking Jeong-mok?"

210
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:55,886
-Something like that.
-Really? They asked you that?

211
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:57,972
Yeah, and I remember clearly
when it happened.

212
00:09:58,055 --> 00:09:59,140
-Oh, really? Well…
-Mmm.

213
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:00,349
-When was it?
-Huh?

214
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:03,019
When I cut my hand
and was disinfecting it…

215
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,812
-Mmm.
-…you grabbed me here.

216
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:05,980
[mellow music playing]

217
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:08,190
-There? In the Lounge?
-Yeah, you're right.

218
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,652
YESTERDAY MORNING

219
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,654
[indistinct chatter]

220
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:16,616
[Seung-chan] I'm gonna sanitize it.

221
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,077
-It stings, right? Hold on.
-[Jeong-mok] Just gotta do it.

222
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:21,912
I know, just do it.

223
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,623
[Ji-yeon] Ah, it hurts so much.

224
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,251
Jeong-mok held my hand during that.

225
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,838
I think that was the moment.

226
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:34,133
Whenever I'm doing something,

227
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:36,469
Jeong-mok is always there beside me,

228
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:39,388
helping me in some way,

229
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,848
taking care of me.

230
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,683
So that's why…

231
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:44,977
That's a water gun?

232
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,812
-[Mi-ji] You gotta fill it.
-Is this not it?

233
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:49,231
-You need help?
-What?

234
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,650
Need help finding it?

235
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,443
[feel-good music playing]

236
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:53,819
[Min-hong] Wow. Oh, man.

237
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,197
I drank so much.

238
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,699
Let me help.

239
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,284
Jeong-mok, I'm jealous.

240
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:01,202
[Ji-yeon laughs]

241
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:03,412
-Jeong-mok, I'm so jealous right now.
-Thank you.

242
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:06,374
[Han-na] Yeah, he was always by her side.

243
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,335
Oh, I have to give Ji-yeon her tangerines.

244
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:11,212
-Wait, what about Ji-yeon?
-What?

245
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:13,673
I mean, Ji-yeon said
she wanted to eat since last night,

246
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,841
but she didn't seem
to be able to eat today either.

247
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,510
Really? All this food's for me?

248
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:19,512
-[Jeong-mok] I saved it from earlier.
-Really?

249
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,013
-[Jeong-mok] Bye.
-Thank you.

250
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:25,476
That really stuck with me, it moved me.

251
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:31,816
WHAT TYPE OF GUY
WOULD YOU BE ATTRACTED TO?

252
00:11:31,899 --> 00:11:33,025
Well…

253
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:37,071
Actually, I just
want someone who's mature.

254
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:40,533
I'm the type of person
who is always the caretaker,

255
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:43,953
but I just want someone
who can take care of me too.

256
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:46,956
And who has a sense of humor,

257
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:50,042
but can also be serious
when he needs to be.

258
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:51,585
You know?

259
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,921
[pleasant guitar music playing]

260
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:58,175
[Ji-yeon] As the days went by,
I noticed that he had those traits.

261
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:00,136
I really liked those aspects of him.

262
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,642
Today's my best day in Jeju so far.

263
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:07,560
Me too.

264
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:14,358
To be honest, I've been
emotionally drained these last few days.

265
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:16,485
I couldn't decide.

266
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:19,196
LAST NIGHT

267
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,239
I thought,

268
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:23,617
"Did I say that too soon?
Was I too forward?"

269
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:26,954
And Ji-yeon is roommates with Do.

270
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:31,208
So I was worried
that the situation could become a little…

271
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:33,294
awkward for them.

272
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:35,004
I kept worrying about that part.

273
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:38,966
And up until last night,
I didn't really know how I felt.

274
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,302
And now, after this…

275
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:44,430
well, I know things aren't over yet,

276
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:47,475
but those worries all went away.

277
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,102
She is the one I want.

278
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:51,228
[inhales]

279
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,271
I'm sure of that.

280
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,191
The way she talks…

281
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:56,317
[inaudible]

282
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,443
…her eyes,

283
00:12:58,402 --> 00:12:59,403
and things like that.

284
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:00,988
I just felt sure of it.

285
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:05,576
[Ji-yeon] I was just… so happy.

286
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,244
[laughs]

287
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:11,999
So I said to Jeong-mok,
"I wish today was the last day,

288
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:15,753
so we could just run away
and be together." [laughs]

289
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:18,255
-[feel-good music continues]
-[Ji-yeon chuckles]

290
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:21,592
Oh, he's sure of himself now.

291
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:24,178
Until yesterday,
I think he was worried about

292
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:26,597
-how Ji-yeon would feel if he told her.
-Right.

293
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,600
-And he was worried about Do too. So--
-"Will she be surprised?"

294
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:31,852
-He couldn't find clarity.
-[Eun-ji] Yeah.

295
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:36,190
But I think today is when he became
certain of his feelings toward her.

296
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:38,192
-[Eun-ji sighs]
-[Han-na sighs] I'm so glad.

297
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:39,944
Just a few days ago, Ji-yeon was saying,

298
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:41,987
-"I have nothing to do now."
-Yeah, she said that.

299
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,240
I feel really good about this couple.

300
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,741
-Right.
-They're comforting.

301
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:48,410
You can really feel
that they're healing each other.

302
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,829
-[Han-na] Right.
-And it's so nice to see that.

303
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:54,667
[Do sobbing]

304
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:03,384
[melancholic music playing]

305
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:04,552
Feelings can change.

306
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:07,221
I understand that, but…

307
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:10,849
Do you think your feelings will change?

308
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,476
I don't think they'll change.

309
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:15,854
I don't wanna confuse you.

310
00:14:16,438 --> 00:14:17,648
I'm sorry.

311
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:19,149
I'll do better.

312
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,568
No confusion.

313
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:21,777
[chuckles]

314
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,029
I'm not gonna talk about this…

315
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,072
[Do] What?

316
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:27,575
I'm not gonna
talk about this stuff with Ji-yeon.

317
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,660
I won't say I care about her.

318
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:37,835
I think changing your mind
after re-assuring someone that you won't,

319
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:41,922
it's very hurtful. [inhales]

320
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:48,304
The reason I'm feeling so hurt and upset
is because I like Jeong-mok so much.

321
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:49,430
[chuckles]

322
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,183
-[sniffles]
-[Han-na] Mmm.

323
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,226
[Eun-ji] Of course.

324
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:57,271
She was just opening up
and starting to really like him.

325
00:14:57,354 --> 00:15:00,065
When Do started liking Jeong-mok the most,

326
00:15:00,149 --> 00:15:02,318
Jeong-mok became sure
of his feelings for Ji-yeon.

327
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:05,779
Yeah, but if you think about it,
Jeong-mok telling Do,

328
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:07,907
"I won't confuse you." Things like that…

329
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,284
-Right, he shouldn't have told her…
-Why did he say that?

330
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:12,161
-…that his feelings wouldn't change.
-Yeah.

331
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,330
She heard him say that.

332
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:17,583
I get why Do is upset. Oh, man.

333
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:22,755
-[Jeong-mok] Is it raining hard?
-[Do] No, barely sprinkling.

334
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:24,465
-[Jeong-mok] It's not?
-[Do] Yeah, no.

335
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:27,092
-[Han-na] Do and Jeong-mok?
-They're talking.

336
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:29,470
Oh, good. Please explain things to her.

337
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:34,224
-Ji-yeon and I…
-Mmm.

338
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:38,270
-We had a talk, actually.
-Yeah, yeah.

339
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,231
-After you left…
-Mmm.

340
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,609
-…Ji-yeon came.
-Mmm.

341
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:46,779
-Oh, had you asked to see Ji-yeon?
-Yeah. Yeah.

342
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,740
I was too embarrassed to tell you before.

343
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:51,533
It's okay. It doesn't matter.

344
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:54,870
I just…

345
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:56,956
For me, Ji-yeon…

346
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,584
is the one.

347
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:03,212
[Do] Mmm. Really?

348
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,172
Yeah, I think she is.

349
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:08,300
I, uh…

350
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:10,386
That's how I feel.

351
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:13,764
Congratulations.
Good for you. [chuckles softly]

352
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:17,226
I just… feel really sure of it. So…

353
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:18,602
[Do] I see.

354
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:21,355
Hmm. [clicks tongue] I was wondering,

355
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,484
"How should I tell her this?
When should I tell her?"

356
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:27,820
[gentle music playing]

357
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:32,032
And you brought it up…

358
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,201
-[clicks tongue]
-[chuckles]

359
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:37,287
-So why do you look so upset right now?
-I'm sorry. I'm just…

360
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:39,039
-Right.
-It's not like…

361
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,835
It's not like you've messed up
at a job interview.

362
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:44,753
-Right. I didn't…
-[chuckles softly]

363
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,214
Oh, Do is actually consoling him.

364
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:49,925
-Do is so cool.
-[In-guk] Yeah, she really is.

365
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,387
I'm just like…

366
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,306
You're a really attractive person.

367
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,641
You're so cool.

368
00:16:58,308 --> 00:16:59,643
So who am I to…

369
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:02,896
[sighs] But anyway, I needed to tell you.

370
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:06,400
Good for you.

371
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:09,945
[chuckles]

372
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,613
So, I mean…

373
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:16,326
-We don't have much time left.
-Yeah.

374
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:18,787
Spend as much time as you can with Ji-yeon

375
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,874
and really get to know each other,
that'd be great.

376
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:24,126
Mmm.

377
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:27,671
Just, you know, keep it fun,
you know? No pressure.

378
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,715
-[Jeong-mok] Have fun?
-I hope you do.

379
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:33,218
-Thanks. I can tell you're older than me.
-What? [chuckles]

380
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:37,264
-You're so much more mature than I am.
-Wow, you're telling me I'm mature now?

381
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:38,182
Seriously… Wow.

382
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,142
Can I keep treating you like a big sister?

383
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:41,060
Why?

384
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:43,395
Can we keep in touch
after the show's, you know, over?

385
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,105
-After the show?
-Mm-hmm.

386
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,233
Oh, we should talk about that.

387
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,694
We probably won't see each other.

388
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:51,612
Oh?

389
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:54,948
-We won't?
-Hey, why would we see each other?

390
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:56,617
-Think about it.
-Mmm.

391
00:17:57,326 --> 00:17:59,078
-Don't you think?
-Yeah, you're right.

392
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,288
I mean, I'll see you
when we all get together.

393
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:02,956
Like, what's he thinking?

394
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,501
Yeah, I'd understand
if she slapped him right now.

395
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:06,960
[mellow music playing]

396
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,295
How can I put it?

397
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:11,673
-You know this, but…
-Mmm.

398
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,926
-…my time is precious to me.
-Right.

399
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:17,721
-If I see someone privately…
-Yeah.

400
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,556
…they have to be, like,

401
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:22,518
-a very, very important person to me.
-Right.

402
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:23,977
-That's just how I am.
-Hmm.

403
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:27,022
Those are my values,
and like we've talked about before,

404
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:29,983
I want to be true to myself and my values.

405
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,110
[Jeong-mok] Right.

406
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,445
And I will be.

407
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:34,905
-I got it.
-Mmm.

408
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:37,783
[smacks lips]

409
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:42,871
[Jeong-mok] I started tearing up.

410
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,582
Because I know how bad it feels

411
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,836
to be rejected by someone.

412
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,380
-I thought…
-[imperceptible]

413
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:54,424
"Oh, she must be feeling terrible."

414
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:57,886
I felt bad, and I tried not to cry.

415
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:01,557
But I went off to the bathroom
to wipe my tears a little bit.

416
00:19:03,267 --> 00:19:05,602
-[Do] But later, in retrospect…
-Hmm?

417
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:08,856
[Do] …this will all be a fun
and really special, memory for me.

418
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:11,817
[Jeong-mok] Me too.

419
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,114
What? How are you so cool, Do?

420
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:18,031
Oh, what?

421
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:20,242
-Yes, good for you, girl.
-[Car] "Be myself."

422
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,161
-Words to live by.
-[Han-na] Yeah.

423
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:24,454
-Do must be really sad right now.
-[In-guk] Yeah, wow…

424
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:27,249
-[Eun-ji] Right, right.
-He kinda deserved to get slapped.

425
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:28,208
[laughter]

426
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:31,044
"Good for you"
has many different meanings though.

427
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:32,713
-"Good for you."
-[Car] Yeah.

428
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:35,340
But for Jeong-mok,
this is the right thing to do.

429
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:36,633
-[Car] It is.
-He had to do it.

430
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:39,136
It was a good thing to tell Do right away

431
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:41,805
-once he felt sure about his feelings.
-[Car] Right.

432
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:42,973
[Eun-ji] Mmm.

433
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:46,059
Why do you think he couldn't be honest
with Min-hong though?

434
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,853
-He's scared, that's why.
-[Han-na] Scared?

435
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,315
-Because Min-hong might be too intense?
-[Car] Yeah.

436
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:55,527
Was he scared that Min-hong might go,
"Do whatever the hell you want!"

437
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:56,570
[inhales sharply]

438
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:59,364
I think Jeong-mok should tell
Min-hong soon, regardless.

439
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:00,824
He needs to. Definitely.

440
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:04,661
PARK JI-YEON
YI DO

441
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:14,254
[gentle melancholic music playing]

442
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,302
[insects trilling]

443
00:20:25,432 --> 00:20:26,934
[birds chirping]

444
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:29,394
[music fades]

445
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,897
[pleasant music playing]

446
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:39,488
-[Car] It's been a week already.
-[Eun-ji] Yeah, can you believe that?

447
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:43,158
KIM SANG-HO
KIM SEUNG-LI

448
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,451
Should I wear this?

449
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:48,330
My rabbit tee?

450
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,165
[quirky music playing]

451
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,501
This is cool, right?

452
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:55,128
-[Seung-li laughs] I guess…
-I have two of these shirts at home.

453
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:58,382
Hey, listen, a lot of people
have said I'm cute.

454
00:20:58,465 --> 00:20:59,716
THE RABBIT T-SHIRT
SANG-HO LOVES

455
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,219
-I told him not to take that, but he did.
-A Miffy T-shirt?

456
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,721
You told him not to wear
T-shirts with characters.

457
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:06,807
That's a disaster.

458
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:09,226
The characters get stretched out.

459
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:11,019
-You see what I mean, Sang-ho?
-Right.

460
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:14,147
They get stretched out.
Don't do that to these guys.

461
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:15,732
I'm wearing it.

462
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:20,529
[singing in Korean]

463
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:23,532
-[in English] Why is he so chipper?
-Why are you in such a good mood?

464
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:25,784
Screw it. I'm wearing it.

465
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:27,536
[quirky music continues]

466
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,082
[Do shouts]

467
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:34,209
-[Seung-chan] You look tired.
-[Jeong-mok] Sleeping?

468
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,878
[Seung-chan] Don't doze off at the table,
you can go back to bed.

469
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:39,172
-Should I work out there?
-[Do] Hey, what…

470
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,590
-Why?
-[Do] Are those PJs?

471
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:41,675
No, this is my trademark.

472
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:43,302
-That's adorable.
-It's cute.

473
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:45,887
-Oh, really?
-You have such cute pajamas, Sang-ho.

474
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,431
Oh, thank you very much.

475
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:50,142
[Ji-su] What are we doing today?

476
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:52,728
-[Min-hong] I don't know.
-[Ji-yeon] I have no idea.

477
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,479
-[Sang-ho] Something new?
-Ding-dong.

478
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:57,482
It's a newsletter?
It must be a newsletter.

479
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:59,067
-[cell phone chimes]
-Oh, that's mine?

480
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,485
[Min-hong] Oh, really?

481
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,571
[upbeat music playing]

482
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:06,700
Mr. Kang Hyun-kyu, we have a newsletter.

483
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:08,827
[Hyun-kyu] Thank you.

484
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,788
-[Seung-li] What?
-What's happening today?

485
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:13,832
What? An overnight date.

486
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:15,834
-[Eun-ji and Car exclaim]
-[Car] What?

487
00:22:15,917 --> 00:22:17,252
[Han-na] Overnight date?

488
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,920
[Eun-ji] Oh, my gosh!

489
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:22,799
Eternal singles on an overnight date?
Alone? How is that even possible?

490
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:25,260
-They must be so excited.
-[Han-na] Must be so nervous too.

491
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,721
[Jae-yun] Look, it's a villa with a pool.

492
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:29,681
[Seung-li] Wow, that sounds great.

493
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:30,932
[Min-hong] We all really need

494
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,976
-to get some quality R&R.
-[Yeo-myung] Exactly.

495
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,561
[upbeat music continues]

496
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:36,313
I wanna go glamping.

497
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:38,774
[Eun-ji] That looks really nice.

498
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,525
[Hyun-kyu] Glamping is very cool.

499
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:43,445
-[Jae-yun] A hanok?
-[Mi-ji] Great vibe.

500
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:44,780
It's a traditional house.

501
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:47,532
[Eun-ji gasps] This place
is really pretty too.

502
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,409
[Hyun-kyu] Any of these would be nice.

503
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:52,579
It says to text the name
of the person we'd like to go with.

504
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:53,747
[music fades]

505
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:56,416
Then, you and Seung-li…

506
00:22:58,502 --> 00:22:59,461
JEONG-MOK, JI-YEON

507
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:01,463
Who else is there? You, right?

508
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:04,466
What?

509
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,677
JEONG-MOK INVITED YOU
TO THE OVERNIGHT DATE

510
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:10,430
-[Han-na] Do is sitting right next to her.
-[Car] Yep.

511
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:12,015
[tense music playing]

512
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:14,643
-Right, she needs to be secretive.
-[Eun-ji] Oh, no.

513
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:19,022
JI-YEON, JEONG-MOK

514
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:20,107
[Do] Mm-hmm.

515
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,441
That must be fun.

516
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:22,400
Overnight?

517
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:26,113
[Do] Which do you want?

518
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:27,781
[Ji-yeon] I like all of them.

519
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:29,407
Yeah, they all look nice.

520
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:32,410
But if I'm going, maybe I should pick
the most expensive one?

521
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:34,371
A place I couldn't typically afford.

522
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:35,455
[chuckles]

523
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:39,543
I'm thinking
I probably won't do anything today.

524
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:42,879
-Oh, I can't breathe.
-This room is so suffocating.

525
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:45,382
They're talking
without even really looking at each other.

526
00:23:49,427 --> 00:23:50,554
[music fades]

527
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:56,560
-I think she's just going outside.
-[Eun-ji] Where?

528
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:59,771
-I think that's for the best. Yeah.
-[Han-na] Maybe don't stay there.

529
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:11,992
[grunts]

530
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:21,209
[sobs]

531
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:25,213
[sniffles]

532
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,256
[sighs]

533
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:27,632
[sobbing]

534
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,718
[gentle melancholic music playing]

535
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:33,430
[continues sobbing]

536
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:46,902
I thought, "Okay."

537
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:49,654
"Jeong-mok and Ji-yeon…

538
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:53,116
are definitely
gonna spend a night together."

539
00:24:55,785 --> 00:25:00,790
But I still decided to ask him
to go spend the night with me.

540
00:25:01,499 --> 00:25:02,500
So I did.

541
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:08,131
YI DO, JEONG-MOK

542
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:10,008
-She picked him.
-[Han-na exclaims]

543
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:12,052
[sighs] Oh, this is so…

544
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,137
LEE MIN-HONG
KIM MI-JI

545
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:15,805
-[paper rustling]
-[music fades]

546
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:17,724
This has to be mutual, right?

547
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:19,392
-It is, right?
-Then, I won't go.

548
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:23,021
I won't go. [sighs]

549
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:25,106
I can't go.

550
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,650
[laughs]

551
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:28,902
-I just won't go. I can't go.
-I can't go.

552
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:31,446
-[amusing music playing]
-[Mi-ji chuckles]

553
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:35,325
I figured that most of us
wouldn't get to do the overnight thing.

554
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:36,701
It is what it is.

555
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:40,789
-Oh, in order to go, it has to be mutual.
-Okay, if it's not mutual, you can't go.

556
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:45,293
-I can't do it.
-Wait, this…

557
00:25:46,378 --> 00:25:47,587
How can I do this?

558
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:51,967
Well, I just had a feeling that…

559
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:57,472
the relationship was coming to an end.

560
00:25:57,555 --> 00:25:59,307
-[wistful music playing]
-[inhales]

561
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,226
She'll go with the person she likes.

562
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:04,813
I said to myself,

563
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:09,693
"Ji-su will probably go with Seung-li."

564
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:14,114
First, tell me, is there anyone?

565
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:18,660
Well, I just sent it in,
since it's first come, first served.

566
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:23,707
-I guess I should do that too, but…
-But the people who are left behind here…

567
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:29,296
HYUN-KYU, JI-SU

568
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:31,006
[Han-na] Yes, send it. Good job.

569
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:33,300
[Eun-ji] Yeah,
just give it a shot, Hyun-kyu.

570
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:37,262
[Seung-li] Do it fast.

571
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,057
We already know who Seung-li will pick.

572
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:45,437
Oh, no. I wrote, "Kang Su-ji."

573
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,563
-What?
-[Eun-ji exclaims]

574
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:48,148
-I wrote, "Kang Su-ji."
-"Kang Su-ji"?

575
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:51,109
-Hurry up and resend it. Kang Su-ji?
-[Eun-ji] Why "Kang Su-ji"?

576
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:52,027
[Han-na laughs]

577
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,112
SEUNG-LI, JI-SU

578
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:57,532
-[Ji-su] I'm gonna talk to Seung-li.
-[Yeo-myung] See ya.

579
00:26:57,615 --> 00:26:59,617
[mellow music playing]

580
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:03,288
[sighs heavily]

581
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:06,583
[Han-na] What?
Why does she want to talk to Seung-li?

582
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:08,043
What's the reason?

583
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:13,840
HYUN-KYU AND SEUNG-LI
INVITED YOU TO THE OVERNIGHT DATE

584
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:14,966
[sighs]

585
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:20,221
[Seung-li] Ji-su?

586
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:23,975
Where are you going?

587
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:26,102
-I wanted to talk to you.
-Really?

588
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:27,854
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah.

589
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:28,772
Okay.

590
00:27:29,981 --> 00:27:31,066
Why?

591
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:35,111
So, I just saw
that you asked me on the date.

592
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:40,784
Well, I was gonna pick you
if I got to choose a date today.

593
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:45,246
-But it's an overnight date. [chuckles]
-Right.

594
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:48,208
-That's too much, right?
-Yeah.

595
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:51,461
I'm not saying you're too much. I just--

596
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:52,379
No, I get it…

597
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:56,633
I just feel uneasy about
staying out somewhere overnight.

598
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:58,385
The other couples will be gone, though,

599
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:00,804
so, if you're okay with it,

600
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:03,932
we could walk around the sheep farm and…

601
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:05,850
-Oh, I think that'd be better.
-Right, me too.

602
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:08,103
-I thought the same thing. Like…
-Huh…

603
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:09,938
-"Oh, won't this be too much for us?"
-Yeah.

604
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:11,898
If it's overnight,
it'll just be the two of us.

605
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:15,693
No, I'm happy to hang out by ourselves.
I'd be glad to have time to talk.

606
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:17,237
-Mmm.
-[chuckles]

607
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:21,408
This sounds silly, but I don't wanna leave
my room and my bed.

608
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:22,826
-Yeah, I get you.
-Yeah.

609
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:24,577
-You have to pack and all.
-Yeah.

610
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:25,578
Thanks for telling me.

611
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:27,705
-Is that okay?
-Yeah, I'm really okay.

612
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:29,416
But if you wanna go, I can totally go.

613
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:31,126
No, I think staying here is better.

614
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:32,794
-Great.
-This place is comfortable.

615
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:35,088
-It's okay?
-Yeah. Just cancel it. Say no.

616
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:36,631
It's really fine.

617
00:28:36,714 --> 00:28:37,882
-Really?
-Really.

618
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,717
-Promise? Promise you're not upset?
-Oh, I…

619
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:41,261
-I'm not upset at all.
-Oh, really?

620
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,679
I actually prefer this.

621
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:45,640
-Just do it. Reject the invite. All done.
-Thank you for understanding.

622
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:49,352
[Seung-li] To be honest,

623
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:51,771
the villa sounded nice,

624
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:56,359
but I told Ji-su to reject the request
so she would be more comfortable.

625
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:59,237
If I'm with her,
I don't care about the location.

626
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,490
What's important is that we're together.

627
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,118
The rest doesn't matter.

628
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:09,289
Oh, they should've just gone to the villa.
Why are they staying?

629
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:13,001
Yeah, but Ji-su was overwhelmed
even just coming to Jeju.

630
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:15,628
-I like the way Seung-li handled that.
-Totally.

631
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:18,047
Instead of being like, "Why? What?"

632
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:20,258
-He was just like, "Oh, right."
-[Han-na] Exactly.

633
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:23,553
"I'd prefer to stay here too."
He empathized with her right away.

634
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:26,139
-So, Ji-su wouldn't feel uncomfortable.
-Yeah, precisely.

635
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:27,640
[breathing heavily]

636
00:29:30,518 --> 00:29:31,352
What's up?

637
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,355
-Hey, are you messing with us?
-[Seung-li] Why?

638
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,982
-Are you kidding?
-No, no.

639
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:36,900
[Seung-li] Why?

640
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,735
[Hyun-kyu] You're leaving, right?

641
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:40,570
-I'm not going overnight.
-[Hyun-kyu] What?

642
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:41,863
No, I'm not.

643
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:44,199
-Really?
-[Seung-li] Yeah.

644
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:45,825
-What happened?
-You're not, either?

645
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:47,410
-[Seung-li] No.
-What, uh…

646
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:49,496
I guess Ji-su didn't pick anyone.

647
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:50,747
What is this?

648
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:53,166
[Seung-chan] Then where were you?

649
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:57,045
-I thought you'd left. Since I was here.
-The four of us were just hanging out.

650
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:59,881
-Well, I'm gonna go to the Lounge.
-[Seung-chan] Right. Okay, see ya.

651
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:02,717
[intriguing music playing]

652
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:05,178
She didn't pick either of us?

653
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:09,432
I mean, she didn't pick me and I thought
she'd definitely pick him, but she didn't.

654
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:10,350
What the hell?

655
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:13,144
I was confused.
I knew I'd lost the competition.

656
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:15,480
I was like,
"Why didn't those two leave together?"

657
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:20,026
She said it was 70-30, so I just tried
to accept that it wouldn't happen.

658
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:22,153
Why, in ancient history,

659
00:30:22,237 --> 00:30:24,614
did General Gyebaek and his men
fight to their deaths,

660
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:27,116
when they knew they were up against
a much bigger army?

661
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,870
They all knew, but they still did it.
So I have to try my best.

662
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:34,541
-Passion is starting to light his fire.
-He really doesn't need to do anything.

663
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:36,876
"I have to try my best."
He seems pretty hopeful.

664
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,086
I didn't expect that at all.

665
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:39,921
-[Car] That's nuts.
-Wow, this is crazy.

666
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:42,882
[music fades]

667
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:45,426
[pensive music playing]

668
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:51,558
[Eun-ji] Oh, this is so uncomfortable.

669
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:54,727
-The whole atmosphere is unbearable.
-[Car] It's so awkward in here.

670
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:57,397
Are you gonna go if you get asked?

671
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,356
[Ji-su] I'm not sure.

672
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:00,024
You'll accept?

673
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:02,652
[chuckles softly]

674
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:05,697
I'll probably just hang out in my room.

675
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:07,490
I'm sure I won't get asked.

676
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,158
Me too.

677
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:11,578
You?

678
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:14,956
I won't. There's no one else
I'd ask besides him.

679
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,749
[Yeo-myung] I mean, we never know,

680
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:20,587
-so we're holding onto some hope.
-[Min-hong] But that really won't happen.

681
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:24,841
[music fades]

682
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:27,302
-Do you wanna go out?
-[Ji-yeon] Huh?

683
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:30,638
YOUR OVERNIGHT DATE HAS BEEN CONFIRMED
PLEASE PACK AND DEPART

684
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,307
Huh? Hold on. I'll be back.

685
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,058
-[Min-hong] Now?
-[Ji-su] Okay. See you.

686
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:36,686
[tense music playing]

687
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:38,980
What? Just like that?

688
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:40,398
Oh, gosh.

689
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:43,192
Have fun, Ji-yeon.

690
00:31:45,778 --> 00:31:46,905
[Ji-su] Have fun.

691
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:48,823
Min-hong.

692
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:50,533
Min-hong.

693
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:52,076
Yeah?

694
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:54,454
-See ya.
-[Min-hong] Bye.

695
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:56,414
-[Ji-su] See you later. Have fun.
-Have fun.

696
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,042
I actually feel so bad.

697
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:01,127
Oh, don't feel bad. Just have fun.

698
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:05,423
-[Ji-su] She's right. Have fun.
-This is making it worse. Go!

699
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:07,800
-It's okay. What's wrong?
-[Yeo-myung] What's wrong?

700
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:11,262
No, what's wrong? Just have fun. Oh, gosh.

701
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:12,221
[chuckles]

702
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:16,184
-Min-hong… I feel so bad. I'm sorry.
-Hey, it's okay.

703
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:19,771
You really don't have to worry.
Don't feel bad because of me.

704
00:32:19,854 --> 00:32:20,897
[Ji-yeon sniffles]

705
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,065
[cries]

706
00:32:22,148 --> 00:32:24,067
[Min-hong] No, you really shouldn't be.

707
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:25,860
You really shouldn't be.

708
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:29,739
-If you like him, you should go.
-Yeah. I'll bring back something yummy.

709
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:32,408
-Yeah, be sure to eat well there.
-I'll bring back stuff.

710
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:34,410
-Feel good and have fun.
-Okay.

711
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:36,412
That's what you should do.

712
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,499
In that moment,

713
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:42,418
I felt bad that she was crying over this.

714
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:44,003
But on the other hand,

715
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:47,840
I understand why she felt bad.

716
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:49,759
From the first day we were here,

717
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:51,970
I was the one interested in Jeong-mok,

718
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,847
and Ji-yeon had heard all about it.

719
00:32:54,931 --> 00:33:00,061
So she must've felt bad about
how things had turned out in the end.

720
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:05,233
Because Min-hong told Ji-yeon
about her feelings for Jeong-mok.

721
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:07,986
-She knows all of that, so she feels bad.
-[Car] She heard…

722
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:09,779
-What can you do?
-But it's better to go.

723
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:12,198
-Just go?
-I also understand, but in this situation…

724
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:14,826
-[Car] Yes,
-…Ji-yeon has to go, right? [inhales]

725
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:17,453
Oh, but I think
I'd be more hurt if she just left.

726
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:18,913
-Me too.
-I think I'd be hurt.

727
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,248
-Better to just leave.
-Really?

728
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:22,750
-Between women, we feel…
-You prefer that? I can see that.

729
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,627
The girls have gotten really close,

730
00:33:24,711 --> 00:33:26,587
and she's just saying
how she feels right now.

731
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:30,258
And if she expresses herself like that,
they could root for her and encourage her.

732
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:32,301
-Right.
-"Hey, come on. It's okay." Like that.

733
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:34,053
-I see what you mean.
-[Eun-ji] Oh, so--

734
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:36,389
Regardless of what she does,
she'll be resented.

735
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:37,932
So it's better to express herself.

736
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,183
Ji-yeon did the right thing

737
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:40,893
-in voicing her feelings.
-Right.

738
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:42,854
[Cupids laughing]

739
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:51,654
-Do?
-[Do] Yeah.

740
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:53,990
I was just cleaning up a little.

741
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:56,451
Okay. I'll be back tomorrow.

742
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:59,162
[cheerfully] It sounds like it'll be fun!

743
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,164
-Do.
-Yeah?

744
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,041
Are you okay?

745
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:04,292
[Do] Why?

746
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:06,419
[Ji-yeon sighs] I'm sorry.

747
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:08,963
Why are you sorry? It's totally fine.

748
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:11,049
I'm okay. No, really, Ji-yeon.

749
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:13,051
No, I'm serious, it's all right.

750
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:14,135
Go and have fun.

751
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:16,387
I mean it. It's really okay.

752
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:19,265
I mean, this is just how things work.

753
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:23,227
-It's fine, Ji-yeon. It is what it is.
-[Ji-yeon crying]

754
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:25,229
No, no. Stop it, I'm fine with it.

755
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:27,106
Go, go. It's okay. You should pack.

756
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:28,983
Go pack. You need to go soon.

757
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,485
[Ji-yeon sniffles, chuckles]

758
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:33,654
But how can you pack
when you don't know where you're going?

759
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:36,657
-Yeah, I'm just gonna pack a lot.
-Pack tons of stuff.

760
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,951
-[solemn piano music playing]
-[sniffles]

761
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:42,538
-Yeah, pack a lot. So you can look pretty.
-Okay.

762
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:44,123
Bye!

763
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:47,543
[Do] I told her,
"Have fun," in my brightest voice,

764
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:50,004
and acted like I was fine,

765
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:52,715
but I left because
it was hard to be in the room.

766
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,886
NOH JAE-YUN
HA JEONG-MOK

767
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:57,804
[music fades]

768
00:34:57,887 --> 00:34:59,013
[breezy music playing]

769
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:03,059
[Jeong-mok] Okay, pajamas,
underwear, socks…

770
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:16,239
Oh, I think this is their first real date.

771
00:35:16,322 --> 00:35:18,658
-Yeah, they're going on an overnight date…
-[Eun-ji] Right.

772
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:21,077
…right after confessing
their feelings for each other.

773
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:28,334
[happy music playing]

774
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:29,669
[inaudible]

775
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:34,215
[In-guk] They need to
take advantage of alone time.

776
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:35,758
[Han-na] Yeah, that's true.

777
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:36,926
[Ji-yeon] Were you waiting?

778
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:38,636
-Is that a hallabong?
-Yeah.

779
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:42,306
-[music fades]
-[smacks lips] Bye.

780
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:44,684
See ya, Jeong-mok.

781
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:45,768
Are they going?

782
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,689
[tense music playing]

783
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:51,440
[In-guk] Oh, this is so intense.

784
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:52,692
[Han-na exclaims]

785
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:55,820
Honestly, is it that hard to just come out

786
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:58,656
and say whether you like
or dislike someone?

787
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:00,283
I don't know.

788
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:04,537
I'd rather him not tell me.
I don't think he will anyway.

789
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:05,872
Totally.

790
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:09,417
[slurps, clicks tongue]

791
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:16,674
I was just really disappointed
in Jeong-mok,

792
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:18,426
as a person and as a man.

793
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:22,972
Because when you go
on an overnight date with someone,

794
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:25,933
it's because you have feelings for them.

795
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:30,646
Earlier, he told me he was considering me
to be in the running.

796
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:33,733
Obviously, I no longer am.

797
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,569
But he left without saying anything to me.

798
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,822
So, the more I think about it,

799
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:42,617
the more the word "deceit" comes to mind.

800
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:46,120
"Does he just want me as a backup
at the final choice?"

801
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:50,208
"Did he just want
more girls to pick from?"

802
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:53,044
I've been thinking about these things.

803
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,839
Why are we so focused on this?
Maybe 'cause there's nothing to do.

804
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:58,257
-[Min-hong] Yeah, exactly.
-Right.

805
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:00,218
[Min-hong] There's no TV or a radio.

806
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:05,681
I saw Jeong-mok suddenly leave
for his overnight date with Ji-yeon.

807
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,767
I'm rooting for them…

808
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:09,268
[chuckles]

809
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:12,563
but we didn't wanna see that,
to be honest.

810
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:16,192
My head understands, but my heart…

811
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:18,986
felt kinda…

812
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,404
Anyway, that's how I felt.

813
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:23,741
[music fades]

814
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:25,868
-Okay, get in. You get in first.
-Okay.

815
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:31,499
[wistful piano music playing]

816
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:42,093
I brought yakgwa too.

817
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:43,219
-Really?
-Mmm.

818
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:45,137
-For me?
-Mm-hmm.

819
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:50,935
[sighs]

820
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:55,231
[Ji-yeon] I brought tangerines too.

821
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:58,067
-[Jeong-mok] Really?
-[Ji-yeon] Yeah. I packed some too.

822
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,450
[sighs heavily]

823
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:12,081
[Do] It was a bit of a shock.

824
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:14,500
I wasn't over him yet,

825
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:18,504
and then he left for an overnight date.

826
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:20,339
I was sad, but…

827
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:22,341
then I thought,

828
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:25,094
"If they really like each other,

829
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:28,222
there's nothing I can do."

830
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:31,309
-Oh, that hurts.
-[Eun-ji exclaims]

831
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:34,729
I was both Ji-yeon
and Do's Cupid, you know.

832
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:36,564
-Right, you were.
-Right.

833
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:39,608
So, seeing Ji-yeon smile makes me happy,

834
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:42,778
but seeing Do feel sad, I feel sad too.

835
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,197
This is hard for me as well.

836
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:47,283
-[Car] Right.
-Gosh, I feel so bad.

837
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:49,535
[upbeat music playing]

838
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:51,579
-[Ji-yeon] The weather is so nice.
-It really is.

839
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:53,789
OVERNIGHT DATE
JEONG-MOK & JI-YEON

840
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,085
[Han-na] Oh, my gosh.

841
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,506
-[Eun-ji] Look at her eyes. Look at her.
-[Han-na] Whoa!

842
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:06,677
Wow. This is so cool.

843
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,596
-Huh? What is?
-Nothing.

844
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:10,556
[Ji-yeon chuckles]

845
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:15,019
I'm happy to go somewhere far.

846
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:16,354
Me too.

847
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:20,691
This is so nice, you driving us somewhere.

848
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,117
[music fades]

849
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:47,635
-Wow, wow, wow! [screams]
-[In-guk] No!

850
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:50,096
-My God! This is happening!
-[Car] Give us a kiss. Do it!

851
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:51,639
-Ahhh!
-[Car] Hey, don't do that.

852
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:53,015
Hold it like this. Hold it.

853
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:56,769
-Hold it like this. Like this.
-This is making me go crazy. Oh, my gosh!

854
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:58,896
That's somehow more provocative.

855
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:01,273
-This really gives you butterflies.
-Yes.

856
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:04,193
-That's more provocative than this.
-[In-guk] Wow. Wow!

857
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:06,362
-Oh, my. I'm getting butterflies.
-Look at these two.

858
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:08,697
-Hey, you… you kids…
-Hey, look at how red his ears are.

859
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:10,491
-[Cupids laughing]
-Look at him! Look!

860
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:13,494
-Hey, why are you blushing so hard?
-[Car] This is just so…

861
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:14,745
[Han-na] Look at these two!

862
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:16,789
[Eun-ji] I think you need to go on a date.

863
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:19,250
Wow, it felt like I was holding hands
for the first time.

864
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:21,627
-[Eun-ji] This is wild.
-They must be getting butterflies.

865
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:23,963
-I didn't think I'd get these feelings.
-[Han-na] Me too.

866
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:28,801
[enchanting music playing]

867
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:42,106
Do your hands sweat?

868
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:44,525
No, not too much, I don't think.

869
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:46,986
-Why do you ask?
-My hands are sweaty.

870
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:49,238
Oh, really? It's okay, mine aren't.

871
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:53,742
-[Jeong-mok] We're almost there.
-Oh, you're right. I'm getting excited!

872
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:57,037
-Is this it? Ah.
-Oh, it's here, it's here!

873
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,457
-Should I park here?
-Yeah.

874
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,043
-[Jeong-mok] Here.
-[Ji-yeon claps]

875
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:04,670
Thank you so much.

876
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:07,339
-For driving, I mean. [chuckles]
-Thank you.

877
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:08,382
[Ji-yeon] Let's go.

878
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,050
[pleasant music playing]

879
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:13,637
-Where is it?
-Oh, maybe it's back there.

880
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:15,681
[Jeong-mok] Oh, back there?

881
00:41:15,764 --> 00:41:17,183
HANOK VACATION HOME

882
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:18,267
Is this it?

883
00:41:19,518 --> 00:41:22,062
-There, that looks like it.
-[Ji-yeon] Oh, amazing.

884
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:24,064
Wait, this is so nice.

885
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:26,775
I'll go first.

886
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:28,777
Go ahead.

887
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:30,321
Oh… beautiful.

888
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:35,910
This is so cute.

889
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:37,995
[Jeong-mok exclaims]

890
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:40,915
-[Ji-yeon] It really is, wow.
-It's super nice.

891
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:45,336
Oh, so if we sleep separately…

892
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:47,129
-Right…
-…where'd we put the second bed?

893
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:49,924
I think you close the curtains here
and someone sleeps on the floor.

894
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:51,342
On the floor there?

895
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:53,552
That's so cute. They're talking about

896
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:56,013
-their sleeping arrangements.
-Yeah, as soon as they arrive.

897
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:58,307
We should check out the backyard too.

898
00:41:58,390 --> 00:41:59,433
What's there?

899
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:01,352
[Ji-yeon] Let's see.

900
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:03,437
[Jeong-mok] The fireplace here…

901
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:06,065
-I think you can make a fire here.
-Yeah.

902
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:08,984
-[Jeong-mok] And a swing?
-Yeah, wanna get on?

903
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:10,444
[Jeong-mok] Go ahead.

904
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:12,571
-You like roller coasters?
-Yeah, I do.

905
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:14,740
-You do?
-Yeah. Let's go.

906
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:16,033
-What?
-Let's go.

907
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:17,159
Want to?

908
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:20,454
I'll need to buy those headbands.

909
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,164
-[chuckles] Headbands?
-Yeah.

910
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:23,666
What do you mean headbands?

911
00:42:24,291 --> 00:42:25,417
I'll consider wearing one.

912
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:27,211
-Really?
-At my age, I don't know.

913
00:42:27,294 --> 00:42:28,504
[both chuckle]

914
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:30,256
Wow, they're just casually talking

915
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:32,967
about what they're gonna
do together after the show.

916
00:42:33,592 --> 00:42:36,095
-It's great.
-Their relationship has already begun.

917
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:38,097
-It's Day 1.
-That's right. It's Day 1 for them.

918
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:39,181
[Han-na] It starts today.

919
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:43,477
-[Jeong-mok] We'll make dinner, and then…
-Right? [chuckles]

920
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,563
-Should we head in?
-[Jeong-mok] Wanna go inside?

921
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:48,566
[Ji-yeon] Yeah, let's go.
Should we wash the lettuce first?

922
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,361
[music fades]

923
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:55,239
-Do you usually cook a lot?
-Mmm.

924
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:56,198
-You do?
-Mmm.

925
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:59,034
-At home?
-Yeah, and I also pack lunch

926
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:00,494
whenever I go to the studio.

927
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:01,662
-Oh, really?
-Mmm.

928
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:04,039
You work so hard.

929
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:05,708
Of course. I'm no joke.

930
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:07,251
Didn't you say something like that

931
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:09,503
-when we talked about our strengths?
-I did.

932
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:11,589
Your ability to survive, or something?

933
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:15,759
I did. I just said that I thought I could
survive on a deserted island. [chuckles]

934
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:17,595
[chill music playing]

935
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:19,305
[Jeong-mok] I liked her even more.

936
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:22,850
I thought, "She seems
even cooler the more I get to know her."

937
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:25,269
She's so independent and hardworking.

938
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:28,147
-Tenderloin, ribs…
-We could buy a small one, right?

939
00:43:28,230 --> 00:43:29,523
We have sashimi too.

940
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,692
Should we get a little kimchi?

941
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:33,611
[Jeong-mok] Two? One is enough, right?

942
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:34,862
I think one's enough.

943
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:38,949
-[Jeong-mok] Okay, how does this work?
-I'll do it.

944
00:43:42,202 --> 00:43:44,747
-[Jeong-mok exclaims]
-I used this once, at a part-time job.

945
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:46,707
-What job?
-It was a ramen place.

946
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:49,251
-I had to torch the chashu. Yeah.
-Oh, really?

947
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:53,589
So remember, beef gets tough
when you overcook it, so…

948
00:43:53,672 --> 00:43:54,965
[sizzling]

949
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:56,800
…take it off when it's semi-cooked.

950
00:43:57,468 --> 00:43:59,094
It smells insanely good.

951
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:03,724
Everything she did
seemed so cool and competent.

952
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:05,684
I felt like I could learn a lot from her.

953
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:08,604
-[clinks]
-[music fades]

954
00:44:08,687 --> 00:44:10,105
[insects trilling]

955
00:44:18,572 --> 00:44:19,698
Isn't this nice?

956
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:21,325
It is.

957
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:25,496
I wanna come here again.

958
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:31,835
Why does it feel like
we've known each other forever?

959
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:34,171
-Is it just me? Right?
-I feel the same. Yeah.

960
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:36,882
It's… it's fascinating.

961
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:41,637
But they've started drinking.

962
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,598
You think it's okay
to leave them alone together?

963
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:46,392
-It's totally fine.
-[Car] It is, yeah.

964
00:44:46,475 --> 00:44:48,227
-Should I not worry?
-They're fine.

965
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:50,521
-I think something's gonna happen.
-[In-guk] Please!

966
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:52,314
Please be bolder, you guys.

967
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:54,858
-I hope they'll be okay.
-[Eun-ji] Trust me, they got this.

968
00:44:56,402 --> 00:44:58,654
-I wonder what everyone's doing.
-Seriously.

969
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:02,574
-Probably cooking and eating together.
-Right.

970
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:05,411
[Hyun-kyu] Hey, I want soju.

971
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:06,453
Let's have some.

972
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:08,122
[Seung-li] Let's all get drunk.

973
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:09,665
-Let's get drunk today.
-Let's do it.

974
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:10,666
[Sang-ho] Okay.

975
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:13,168
-They all went out together.
-[Eun-ji] They went as a group.

976
00:45:13,252 --> 00:45:15,045
-Oh, all together?
-[Han-na] Nice.

977
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:16,797
Did you order? What do they have?

978
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,550
-We got the four-person set.
-This is for four people. This one.

979
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:23,637
-We can order more but this has a variety.
-We'll get more if it's not enough.

980
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:25,764
[jaunty music playing]

981
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:28,684
-Sang-ho ate here before.
-[Han-na] The place where he ate alone.

982
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:34,231
-[In-guk] It must've been delicious.
-[Han-na] He went back.

983
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:35,524
[Do] This is so good.

984
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:36,859
It's really good.

985
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,069
[Ji-su] What?

986
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:41,113
-[Min-hong] Should we cheers?
-[Seung-chan] Let's.

987
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:44,032
-[Ji-su] To escaping the single life?
-[Seung-chan] Oh, escape…

988
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:45,325
[all] The single life!

989
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:46,493
[all exclaim]

990
00:45:47,202 --> 00:45:49,538
-How embarrassing.
-[Seung-chan] Great to see you all.

991
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,082
That was kind of embarrassing just now.

992
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:55,377
I'm not embarrassed about being single.

993
00:45:55,878 --> 00:45:56,837
It's whatever.

994
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,255
-Of course.
-[Seung-li] You know?

995
00:45:58,338 --> 00:46:00,507
There are more eternal singles
than you'd think.

996
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:02,551
They just don't make themselves known.

997
00:46:02,634 --> 00:46:04,636
Yeah, if we'd met each other
in the real world,

998
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,013
-we'd have no clue.
-Right.

999
00:46:06,096 --> 00:46:07,598
You're right. I always lied about it.

1000
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:09,558
-Totally. I always lied too.
-[Do] Me too.

1001
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:11,310
-Yeah.
-Did you, Jae-yun?

1002
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:14,646
This is sort of embarrassing,
but I'll say it.

1003
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:17,983
My self-esteem was so low
that when people would respond,

1004
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:20,486
"Oh, you've never dated before?"
in a surprised tone,

1005
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:22,488
it would actually improve my self-esteem.

1006
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:23,655
-I felt better.
-[Do] I see.

1007
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:25,365
[Han-na] Oh, so it's opposite for him.

1008
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:27,743
-That's a way to think about it.
-You're very unique.

1009
00:46:27,826 --> 00:46:29,786
-So creative.
-You have a cool way of thinking.

1010
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:32,164
Yeah, you're so charming.
You're very charming.

1011
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:34,666
You get really charming when you drink.

1012
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:36,251
[laughter]

1013
00:46:36,335 --> 00:46:37,336
[Do] Hey, if so…

1014
00:46:37,419 --> 00:46:40,172
-You should drink every morning.
-Drink alcohol instead of water.

1015
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:42,758
-[Hyun-kyu] Morning drink.
-[contestants exclaim, laugh]

1016
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:44,009
Yeah, there you go!

1017
00:46:44,092 --> 00:46:45,469
-That was a joke.
-That's so funny.

1018
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:48,680
-Oh, Jae-yun has a charming side.
-[Ji-su] He has a peculiar charm.

1019
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:51,266
-[Jae-yun] Min-hong.
-Yeah?

1020
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:53,685
-[chuckles, laughs]
-Hey, what is this?

1021
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:55,020
-Min-hong.
-Yeah?

1022
00:46:55,604 --> 00:46:56,480
[Min-hong chuckles]

1023
00:46:56,563 --> 00:46:59,608
-[Seung-chan] What? He's fighting her.
-[Sang-ho] What is this? Stop.

1024
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:00,984
Oh, the chopstick thing.

1025
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:01,944
Oh, you're doing it?

1026
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:05,405
Ah, Min-hong said she hated people
who use chopsticks incorrectly.

1027
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:07,157
-[Car] Yeah.
-[Cupids exclaiming]

1028
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:10,911
-[Seung-chan] So flirty.
-[Min-hong] Wow, you're crazy.

1029
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:12,746
-[Ji-su] What about chopsticks?
-We get it.

1030
00:47:12,829 --> 00:47:14,665
-Hey!
-You can't stand bad chopstick skills.

1031
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:16,375
-No, this is flirting.
-This is so funny.

1032
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:18,418
-Flirting by picking a fight.
-Backwards flirting.

1033
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:21,046
[Min-hong] Wow, how did you remember that?

1034
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:23,257
I actually still hate it.

1035
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:26,009
I hate it when people
use chopsticks like this.

1036
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:29,221
Actually, I can't hold them
correctly, either.

1037
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:33,141
I make an X. But you know,
some people basically make a fist.

1038
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:36,311
[Han-na] Oh, was he thinking
he should try it just to be cute?

1039
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:39,147
-[Seung-chan] So funny he's carrying on.
-But my Cupid, Kang Han-na,

1040
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:40,732
said that was also a skill.

1041
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:44,069
-Now that I'm seeing it, I think it is.
-You're right. It is a skill.

1042
00:47:44,861 --> 00:47:47,030
-It's a unique skill…
-I really didn't expect that!

1043
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:49,241
-I'm honestly so surprised right now.
-That was nice.

1044
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:51,034
-You're improving.
-The company card…

1045
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:52,244
-Raise your glasses.
-Cheers.

1046
00:47:52,327 --> 00:47:53,829
-Come here. Cheers me.
-Cheers.

1047
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:55,205
-[Seung-chan] Cheers.
-Wow.

1048
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:57,708
[Han-na] Jae-yun seems
very comfortable once he drinks.

1049
00:47:57,791 --> 00:47:59,751
[In-guk] You're right.
He looks more comfortable.

1050
00:47:59,835 --> 00:48:02,671
Jae-yun's overflowing
with charm right now.

1051
00:48:02,754 --> 00:48:03,589
Exactly.

1052
00:48:03,672 --> 00:48:05,507
-When he's at ease, he's so charming.
-Right.

1053
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:06,425
I'm so glad.

1054
00:48:06,508 --> 00:48:08,343
-I'm relieved Jae-yun is more relaxed.
-Yeah.

1055
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:09,261
-Finally.
-Yep.

1056
00:48:09,344 --> 00:48:10,262
I'm glad too.

1057
00:48:10,804 --> 00:48:12,931
The main reason I signed up

1058
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:18,478
was because I thought handsome guys
that I couldn't meet in real life

1059
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:19,646
would be here.

1060
00:48:19,730 --> 00:48:21,690
-I'm sorry.
-[laughter]

1061
00:48:21,773 --> 00:48:24,026
-Oh, cheers. Cheers, everyone!
-Sorry to disappoint you.

1062
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:25,319
[Do laughs]

1063
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:27,279
But it's a show for eternal singles.

1064
00:48:27,362 --> 00:48:29,156
-Why did you think…
-Exactly. Good point.

1065
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:32,743
I would've figured that a lot of people
would apply for this show.

1066
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:34,202
[Sang-ho] It's competitive.

1067
00:48:34,286 --> 00:48:37,331
But the funny thing is,
I had the same reasoning as you.

1068
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:39,708
-I thought I would be able to meet…
-[Do] Yeah, exactly.

1069
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:41,335
…someone I couldn't meet in real life.

1070
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:42,919
[Sang-ho] Oh, like handsome singles?

1071
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:44,713
[quirky music playing]

1072
00:48:44,796 --> 00:48:45,839
[chuckles]

1073
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:47,424
[Ji-su] Right…

1074
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:50,427
[Min-hong] The show's concept…
But it's a charming concept,

1075
00:48:50,510 --> 00:48:52,471
-now that I think of it.
-[Do] I think it is.

1076
00:48:52,554 --> 00:48:54,556
Oh, and this… this happened.

1077
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:58,018
[Ji-su] I was thinking about talking
to Seung-li that whole time.

1078
00:48:58,101 --> 00:49:00,896
Because we agreed to stay back
so we could talk on our own.

1079
00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:03,857
But he was sitting so far away.

1080
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:06,860
The girls and boys were split,
we were on opposite ends.

1081
00:49:06,943 --> 00:49:09,321
I thought, "Oh, I didn't expect this."

1082
00:49:09,404 --> 00:49:10,864
"This wasn't the plan."

1083
00:49:10,947 --> 00:49:13,617
I already told him that I don't like it
when he gets drunk.

1084
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:15,243
[Hyun-kyu] You have to drink.

1085
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:18,121
-Okay. Like… like this. Okay.
-[Seung-chan] That's a caterpillar?

1086
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:19,206
"There was a puppy."

1087
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:21,625
-You kept saying that in your room.
-[Mi-ji] Cheers!

1088
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:24,920
-Sang-ho, we need another bottle of this.
-[Sang-ho] You're right.

1089
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:27,923
-Cheers? Oh, really? Okay.
-[Sang-ho] Time is racing. Time is racing.

1090
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:29,800
When I saw him drinking like that,

1091
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:33,095
I honestly found him less attractive.

1092
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:34,721
[Han-na and In-guk gasp]

1093
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:38,058
I guess she didn't really like
that he was leading the drinking.

1094
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:40,769
-Ji-su had planned to go to her room…
-[Han-na] Yeah.

1095
00:49:40,852 --> 00:49:43,063
…talk, and you know,
have a lovey-dovey time.

1096
00:49:43,146 --> 00:49:44,147
Mmm.

1097
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:47,859
Maybe she thought they couldn't do that
because he was drinking.

1098
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:49,820
-[Car] Right.
-She might not wanna talk to him

1099
00:49:49,903 --> 00:49:50,862
while he's drunk.

1100
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:53,198
But if she starts liking him less now…

1101
00:49:53,281 --> 00:49:56,076
You're right. That's not good.
Could Hyun-kyu move up in ranking?

1102
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:58,787
-It's possible. That could happen.
-[Han-na] Wow.

1103
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:01,248
-[Seung-li] That was fun.
-[Sang-ho] Seriously.

1104
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:02,541
[Yeo-myung] Whoa. What's this?

1105
00:50:02,624 --> 00:50:04,918
-Something is playing there.
-[Ji-su] What is it? What?

1106
00:50:05,001 --> 00:50:07,671
-Where?
-Look. That. Over there. The tent.

1107
00:50:07,754 --> 00:50:10,215
-What is that?
-[Seung-li] There's a screen or something.

1108
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:11,633
-Maybe we're seeing a film?
-What?

1109
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:14,761
-[Hyun-kyu] They're showing a movie?
-[Do] What? [laughs]

1110
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:17,472
I guess we're watching a movie here.
There's popcorn.

1111
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:18,682
-[Hyun-kyu] What?
-Wow.

1112
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:20,976
-[Do] Cool.
-[Hyun-kyu] I think it's a movie.

1113
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:23,520
-[contestant exclaims]
-[Seung-chan] We watch from here?

1114
00:50:23,603 --> 00:50:26,064
[Hyun-kyu] Yeah, there's popcorn
and nachos and everything.

1115
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:28,442
[Han-na] It's the eternal singles
movie night.

1116
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:30,026
For those who couldn't go on dates.

1117
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:31,319
[Car] 20th Century Girl?

1118
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:32,487
[Han-na exclaims]

1119
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:34,573
[pleasant music playing]

1120
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:38,201
-[Car exclaims]
-[Han-na chuckles]

1121
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:39,870
[Eun-ji] Wow, Sang-ho. Look at him.

1122
00:50:39,953 --> 00:50:41,872
Sang-ho even eats nachos like that.

1123
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:42,873
[Car] Oh, I love it.

1124
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:44,458
[Eun-ji] He's a great nacho-eater.

1125
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:45,709
HYUN-JIN

1126
00:50:45,792 --> 00:50:47,127
[soft piano music playing]

1127
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:48,545
Hmm?

1128
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:50,338
[chuckles softly]

1129
00:50:51,631 --> 00:50:53,175
-So I wanna know.
-That's the story?

1130
00:50:53,258 --> 00:50:55,719
In the end, both of the girls like…

1131
00:50:55,802 --> 00:50:58,472
-They like the same guy.
-They both like the fake Hyun-jin.

1132
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:00,140
[groans]

1133
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:01,516
[Yeo-myung] That's gotta hurt.

1134
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:02,476
For who?

1135
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,686
-It must be tough for them.
-Everyone.

1136
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:06,980
They like the same guy as their friend.

1137
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:09,191
[indistinct chatter]

1138
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:11,318
[both stifling laughter]

1139
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:12,861
[amusing music playing]

1140
00:51:12,944 --> 00:51:14,321
[both laughing]

1141
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:17,365
-Oh, I'm getting mad. Hold on.
-[In-guk] It must be kinda funny.

1142
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:19,117
-You…
-[Car] They think it's funny too.

1143
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:20,744
-[Han-na] Yeah.
-After she said that…

1144
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:22,662
-[Han-na] Too close to home.
-[In-guk] Right.

1145
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:25,373
-[Min-hong] I mean… I…
-Yeah. Yeah.

1146
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:28,126
…really get how they both feel.

1147
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:31,421
I think I've been
in this situation before, you know?

1148
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:32,339
[Do] I…

1149
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:35,258
-It's funny because it's so relatable.
-Yeah, seriously.

1150
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:39,137
The movie was too similar
to our circumstances.

1151
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:42,015
Two best friends
turned out to like the same guy.

1152
00:51:42,098 --> 00:51:44,309
[laughing] It's exactly
what happened to us.

1153
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:48,146
I mean, I was just like,
"This is too similar."

1154
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:50,524
"I don't wanna watch it." [inhales]

1155
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:53,276
You guys are really impressive. You are.

1156
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:54,778
You really are.

1157
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:57,405
[sighs]

1158
00:51:57,489 --> 00:52:00,909
Just because I used to like you
doesn't mean you can treat me badly.

1159
00:52:00,992 --> 00:52:04,496
You don't seem to understand
that I'm someone's precious child too.

1160
00:52:04,579 --> 00:52:05,747
-I feel that.
-Right.

1161
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:07,749
[Hyun-jin] …I'm someone's
precious child too.

1162
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:09,751
"I'm someone's precious child too."

1163
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:13,839
-I'm someone's precious daughter.
-I am someone's precious daughter.

1164
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:16,883
-[laughs]
-[amusing music playing]

1165
00:52:16,967 --> 00:52:18,510
I already heard that.

1166
00:52:18,593 --> 00:52:19,803
What?

1167
00:52:19,886 --> 00:52:21,012
-Heard what?
-[coughs]

1168
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:22,764
Someone's precious daughter.

1169
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:25,141
-Yeo-myung heard that line from Jeong-mok.
-[Eun-ji] Oh.

1170
00:52:25,225 --> 00:52:26,142
[Han-na] Oh, my gosh.

1171
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:29,104
This is fun. The story feels new,
watching it here,

1172
00:52:29,187 --> 00:52:31,565
-with all that's going on.
-[Do and Yeo-myung chuckle]

1173
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:34,109
I don't like that
I'm laughing while watching this.

1174
00:52:34,192 --> 00:52:35,861
[all laughing]

1175
00:52:36,444 --> 00:52:37,404
Same.

1176
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:41,324
-I don't like that I keep smiling.
-[Do] Why? I actually… I like it.

1177
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:42,993
Hey, think about it.

1178
00:52:43,076 --> 00:52:44,494
This is a brutal situation.

1179
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:47,205
If we're laughing like this,
doesn't that mean we're winning?

1180
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:48,206
[chuckles]

1181
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:49,666
I'm winning in my mind.

1182
00:52:50,166 --> 00:52:51,126
It's good.

1183
00:52:51,209 --> 00:52:52,335
[music fades]

1184
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:55,422
[man] Bo-ra.

1185
00:52:58,216 --> 00:53:00,427
[enthralling music playing]

1186
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:01,720
-[gasps]
-[woman gasps]

1187
00:53:01,803 --> 00:53:03,305
[Eun-ji] Oh, Jae-yun.

1188
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:05,724
[laughs] Why were you surprised?
Why'd you feel surprised?

1189
00:53:05,807 --> 00:53:07,893
Oh, just 'cause I hadn't seen this movie.

1190
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:11,438
But shouldn't they start dating now?

1191
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:13,565
Why is he not asking her out?

1192
00:53:13,648 --> 00:53:16,401
-He's so mean. Seriously.
-[Hyun-kyu] So, so mean.

1193
00:53:16,484 --> 00:53:17,986
He's gotta make things clear.

1194
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:20,322
[Yeo-myung]
That's what I'm saying. Exactly.

1195
00:53:20,405 --> 00:53:21,406
I'm mad.

1196
00:53:21,489 --> 00:53:22,490
Seriously.

1197
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:23,491
[laughing]

1198
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:25,327
-I'm so mad at him!
-[Yeo-myung] I know!

1199
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:26,494
[Mi-ji] Why are you so mad?

1200
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:27,662
-I don't know.
-He's mean…

1201
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:30,081
-He's too charming. Put her under a spell.
-Wow, seriously.

1202
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:32,417
-She can't sleep after that.
-Exactly.

1203
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:35,253
They're all thinking about
their own situations.

1204
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:36,463
[movie plays indistinctly]

1205
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:37,923
[Han-na] Sang-ho's falling asleep.

1206
00:53:38,006 --> 00:53:39,257
[amusing music playing]

1207
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:41,176
-Hey, Sang-ho!
-[Eun-ji] Oh, Sang-ho.

1208
00:53:41,259 --> 00:53:42,552
[Han-na] Oh, gosh. Sang-ho.

1209
00:53:43,178 --> 00:53:46,514
-[In-guk] Isn't that charming?
-[Han-na] Relaxed. He looks comfortable.

1210
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:48,224
-[Car] I love it.
-[Han-na] Yeah.

1211
00:53:49,225 --> 00:53:51,478
He thinks this is his living room.

1212
00:53:56,274 --> 00:53:57,150
[music fades]

1213
00:53:57,233 --> 00:54:00,236
[Jeong-mok] Oh, where should I sleep?
On the couch?

1214
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:02,822
-[Ji-yeon] Isn't it too small?
-Huh?

1215
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:04,950
[Ji-yeon] I'll sleep here then.
I like the floor.

1216
00:54:06,534 --> 00:54:08,536
[mellow music playing]

1217
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:12,791
-You cold?
-No, just a bit chilly.

1218
00:54:12,874 --> 00:54:13,875
-[Ji-yeon] Really?
-Yeah.

1219
00:54:13,959 --> 00:54:16,378
-[Car] Wait, what?
-[Han-na] Why are they sitting so close?

1220
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:18,421
[In-guk] They're holding hands.

1221
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:21,508
-You're holding hands, aren't you?
-[Car] They're hiding it. I can tell.

1222
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:22,676
Uh, no, no, no.

1223
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:24,135
Hey, please kiss, you guys.

1224
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:25,720
-Seriously. Come on.
-"Kiss."

1225
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:28,098
Why am I so comfortable with you?

1226
00:54:29,474 --> 00:54:31,851
It feels like I've known you for years.

1227
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:33,395
-Really?
-Mmm.

1228
00:54:34,187 --> 00:54:36,064
Well, I don't want you to get
too comfortable.

1229
00:54:36,147 --> 00:54:39,734
As in, comfortable in another way.
I'm still nervous. [chuckles]

1230
00:54:42,737 --> 00:54:43,989
[music fades]

1231
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:46,116
-This is really delicious.
-Yeah.

1232
00:54:47,575 --> 00:54:49,202
I literally buy this every time.

1233
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:54,708
Should we stay like this for a bit?

1234
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:58,336
[Han-na] What? She even put
her head on his shoulder.

1235
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:00,422
[romantic music playing]

1236
00:55:09,097 --> 00:55:10,056
Nervous?

1237
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,766
-Mm-hmm.
-Me too.

1238
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:17,731
[Cupids exclaim]

1239
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:20,692
-Hey! Hey, hey, hey. Come on, you guys.
-[Eun-ji] Hey!

1240
00:55:20,775 --> 00:55:22,068
-[both laugh]
-[Car] Hey.

1241
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:24,821
-[Han-na] Are you okay?
-Why doesn't he kiss her?

1242
00:55:24,904 --> 00:55:27,032
-They haven't yet.
-You were telling them to kiss.

1243
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:29,075
Forget about the cameras.
He should kiss her now.

1244
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:31,453
-"Camera."
-He's getting red again.

1245
00:55:31,536 --> 00:55:32,620
He should do it.

1246
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:36,291
-Didn't you tell them to kiss just now?
-Jeong-mok, if you want to, go ahead.

1247
00:55:36,374 --> 00:55:40,378
Actually, earlier in the car and now,
Ji-yeon's being really forward with him.

1248
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:42,839
-[Han-na] When they held hands too.
-Ji-yeon is, yeah.

1249
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:44,632
When Ji-yeon talked about her dad,

1250
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:49,220
she mentioned she had some trauma
and a hard time getting close to people,

1251
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:51,473
but Jeong-mok's helping her
move past that.

1252
00:55:51,556 --> 00:55:54,684
-[Eun-ji] You're right.
-I hope Ji-yeon is able to overcome that,

1253
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:57,937
-so they can have a loving relationship.
-[Car] Yes, exactly.

1254
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:01,399
[Ji-yeon] It's really nice,

1255
00:56:01,483 --> 00:56:03,860
being here alone with you
without other people.

1256
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:05,945
[Jeong-mok] It is.

1257
00:56:09,657 --> 00:56:11,868
Hmm? What?

1258
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:14,245
-You wanna compare hands?
-Yeah.

1259
00:56:15,288 --> 00:56:17,123
-I have small hands.
-I have big hands, right?

1260
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:18,583
-You do.
-Right?

1261
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:21,795
-I have big hands for my height.
-Mine are small for my height.

1262
00:56:22,378 --> 00:56:23,880
Oh, I don't think so.

1263
00:56:23,963 --> 00:56:25,965
[gentle charming music playing]

1264
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:29,052
-[Jeong-mok] My lines are really deep.
-They are.

1265
00:56:29,135 --> 00:56:31,596
-Yeah.
-You have the lines of a rich person.

1266
00:56:31,679 --> 00:56:33,890
-I'm gonna be rich?
-Yeah, this "M" means "Money."

1267
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:36,851
-But I already have a set career, so why…
-I… [chuckles]

1268
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:40,980
So interesting.

1269
00:56:42,607 --> 00:56:45,026
-I have a question.
-Yeah?

1270
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:47,445
In Korea, we say, "I love you,"

1271
00:56:47,529 --> 00:56:49,697
-right after we start dating.
-Mm-hmm.

1272
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:51,449
But in other countries,

1273
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:54,786
I don't think they do that
until much later.

1274
00:56:54,869 --> 00:56:55,912
-Really?
-Yeah.

1275
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:58,123
So I think for them,

1276
00:56:58,206 --> 00:57:00,583
that's the difference
between liking and loving.

1277
00:57:00,667 --> 00:57:01,960
[breathes deeply]

1278
00:57:03,336 --> 00:57:04,504
[Jeong-mok inhales deeply]

1279
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:06,881
What's the difference?

1280
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:08,633
-[Ji-yeon] I'm not really sure.
-No?

1281
00:57:08,716 --> 00:57:09,843
[Ji-yeon] But…

1282
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:14,806
But?

1283
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:17,642
[whispering] With you, it's…

1284
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:19,853
it's love.

1285
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:21,938
[romantic music playing]

1286
00:57:24,065 --> 00:57:25,108
[chuckles softly]

1287
00:57:28,903 --> 00:57:31,072
[Ji-yeon] Did you really mean
what you said?

1288
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:32,449
That you'd marry me?

1289
00:57:34,534 --> 00:57:37,662
It's the first time
I've ever felt this way.

1290
00:57:37,745 --> 00:57:39,080
I just thought,

1291
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:41,291
-"I think I'm going to marry her."
-Really?

1292
00:57:41,374 --> 00:57:42,250
[Jeong-mok] Yeah.

1293
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:48,047
-Mmm.
-Really?

1294
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:55,263
-When you said that to me…
-Mmm.

1295
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:57,974
…I thought the same thing.

1296
00:58:01,227 --> 00:58:02,770
[Jeong-mok] We've said this on camera,

1297
00:58:02,854 --> 00:58:04,898
-so now we have to.
-Exactly. Seriously.

1298
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:09,611
-What do you do when you're in love?
-What do you wanna do?

1299
00:58:09,694 --> 00:58:11,779
First, we need to go to an amusement park

1300
00:58:11,863 --> 00:58:13,031
-and go on rides.
-Mmm.

1301
00:58:13,114 --> 00:58:14,324
Movie theater.

1302
00:58:14,407 --> 00:58:15,617
Do you watch a lot of movies?

1303
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:17,368
-Yeah, but I always go by myself.
-Really?

1304
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:19,913
-Yeah.
-I almost never go to the movies.

1305
00:58:19,996 --> 00:58:21,998
-Really?
-Yeah, I had no one to go with.

1306
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:23,416
Go with me.

1307
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:25,376
-Let's go.
-Mmm.

1308
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:27,587
[Han-na] Oh, they'll do
lots of things together.

1309
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:29,672
[mellow guitar music playing]

1310
00:58:32,675 --> 00:58:35,678
-I don't know. I'm not sure what we'll do.
-Me neither.

1311
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:39,307
-Isn't your heart racing?
-[Eun-ji] That scared me.

1312
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:40,517
What? Oh, that scared me.

1313
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,519
-[laughing]
-[Han-na laughs]

1314
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:44,521
Hey, get that out of your head.

1315
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:46,439
You've got kissing on the brain.

1316
00:58:47,106 --> 00:58:48,858
But they really were just about to.

1317
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:50,068
-Yeah.
-That head angle.

1318
00:58:50,151 --> 00:58:51,778
If we get the right angle…

1319
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:54,322
-He looked at her, then like this. Yeah.
-It was suspicious.

1320
00:58:54,405 --> 00:58:56,533
But the way they're sitting,
it's… it's natural.

1321
00:58:56,616 --> 00:58:58,785
This angle is a bit…
Are you sure they've never dated?

1322
00:58:58,868 --> 00:59:02,080
-They look so natural sitting like that.
-[Eun-ji] You're sure they never dated?

1323
00:59:02,163 --> 00:59:03,706
They got the perfect couch too.

1324
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:06,042
-A small one.
-Yeah, an uncomfortable one.

1325
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:08,002
[mellow music playing]

1326
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:09,796
[Ji-yeon] Isn't your heart racing?

1327
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:10,797
No.

1328
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,424
-I think it is, I can hear it.
-No.

1329
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:16,177
I feel like my heart's racing.

1330
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:26,729
I'm sleepy.

1331
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:27,647
Me too.

1332
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:28,815
[music fades]

1333
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:29,816
Let's sleep.

1334
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:31,067
-[Ji-yeon] Okay.
-Let's go.

1335
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:34,862
I don't wanna spend
all of our time here sleeping,

1336
00:59:34,946 --> 00:59:37,031
so we should get up in a bit.

1337
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:38,658
[Jeong-mok] Agreed.

1338
00:59:41,077 --> 00:59:42,996
This couch is too small to sleep on.

1339
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:45,248
-[Ji-yeon] Yeah.
-Should I lay out blankets?

1340
00:59:45,748 --> 00:59:48,668
[Ji-yeon] Wanna sleep for an hour
and a half then wake up at midnight?

1341
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:49,752
[Jeong-mok] Okay.

1342
00:59:55,592 --> 00:59:57,010
Oh, I don't know.

1343
00:59:57,093 --> 00:59:58,052
[Ji-yeon] I don't know.

1344
00:59:58,136 --> 01:00:00,179
[chuckles] Yeah, just sleep together.

1345
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:02,890
-Yeah, it's fine. The couch is too small.
-[In-guk] Way too small.

1346
01:00:12,859 --> 01:00:14,152
Oh, it's so dark.

1347
01:00:14,235 --> 01:00:15,945
Hey, why is the screen so dark?

1348
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:17,697
-Are they together?
-I can't see anything.

1349
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:20,199
-They got in the same bed.
-Hold on. The light is reflecting…

1350
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:21,451
Hey, they're… they're moving.

1351
01:00:21,534 --> 01:00:22,493
-What?
-They're moving?

1352
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:23,870
[Car] Hey, why are you moving?

1353
01:00:24,704 --> 01:00:26,623
-What?
-[suspenseful whimsical music playing]

1354
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:28,374
[music fades]

1355
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:33,463
-[Jeong-mok whispers] I can't fall asleep.
-Me neither.

1356
01:00:33,546 --> 01:00:36,090
[suspenseful whimsical music resumes]

1357
01:00:40,219 --> 01:00:42,180
-[Han-na] Oh, he's looking around.
-[Car] What?

1358
01:00:42,263 --> 01:00:44,432
-[In-guk] He's looking around.
-[Ji-yeon] It's fine.

1359
01:00:44,515 --> 01:00:45,933
[Jeong-mok whispers] I can't sleep.

1360
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:53,941
[music ends]

1361
01:00:58,071 --> 01:00:59,781
[lips smacking]

1362
01:00:59,864 --> 01:01:01,658
-[Car] What?
-Did they kiss?

1363
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:03,534
[screaming]

1364
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:07,372
-Hey! What is this?
-[Han-na] Did they?

1365
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:10,375
-What is this sound?
-[Han-na] Hold on. What's going on now?

1366
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:11,793
Are they this thing right here?

1367
01:01:11,876 --> 01:01:13,753
-Are they this thing?
-[Car] It's this, right?

1368
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:15,672
-They're smooshed together.
-All mixed up!

1369
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:17,382
-I heard lips smacking.
-You heard that?

1370
01:01:17,465 --> 01:01:18,299
[Eun-ji] Isn't this…

1371
01:01:18,383 --> 01:01:20,176
-Oh, my gosh.
-[Car] Wow, this is amazing.

1372
01:01:20,259 --> 01:01:23,346
-Like they forgot the cameras are there.
-[In-guk] What?

1373
01:01:23,429 --> 01:01:25,139
Hey, is… is this okay?

1374
01:01:25,223 --> 01:01:28,351
-You said they never dated. What is this?
-Yeah, is this… Wow. That was crazy.

1375
01:01:28,434 --> 01:01:29,811
[Eun-ji] What's up with these two?

1376
01:01:29,894 --> 01:01:31,479
-[Han-na] They're wild.
-Actually, this…

1377
01:01:31,562 --> 01:01:32,563
this makes sense.

1378
01:01:32,647 --> 01:01:35,566
-I don't watch a lot of dating shows…
-But that really was crazy.

1379
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:38,236
-Why are you freaking out?
-Do they always do that?

1380
01:01:38,319 --> 01:01:41,406
-[Han-na] "Do they always do that?"
-Do people normally kiss on dating shows?

1381
01:01:41,489 --> 01:01:42,907
-They suddenly kissed.
-Didn't they?

1382
01:01:42,990 --> 01:01:45,118
-Netflix is taking it to the next level.
-I like it.

1383
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:47,620
-[laughing]
-[Han-na laughing]

1384
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:49,539
Why is this so funny?

1385
01:01:50,415 --> 01:01:52,417
[alluring music playing]

1386
01:01:53,334 --> 01:01:54,544
[lips smacking]

1387
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:12,979
[Han-na] Oh, they've got a fire going.

1388
01:02:16,607 --> 01:02:17,650
[music fades]

1389
01:02:19,819 --> 01:02:21,028
[indistinct humming]

1390
01:02:22,613 --> 01:02:24,615
-Yeah? Seung-li.
-Yeah?

1391
01:02:24,699 --> 01:02:26,576
[Ji-su] You have toilet paper
in your bathroom?

1392
01:02:26,659 --> 01:02:27,910
-Toilet paper?
-[Ji-su] Yeah.

1393
01:02:27,994 --> 01:02:30,455
[Seung-li] Hold on. Are you out?

1394
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:32,874
I'll ask.

1395
01:02:32,957 --> 01:02:34,751
I just asked because
I wanted to talk to you.

1396
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:35,710
-Really?
-Mmm.

1397
01:02:35,793 --> 01:02:36,961
Aren't you tired?

1398
01:02:37,044 --> 01:02:38,087
[tense music playing]

1399
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:40,298
-I mean, I just--
-I wanna talk to you, of course.

1400
01:02:40,381 --> 01:02:42,258
-Meet me at the terrace.
-The terrace?

1401
01:02:42,341 --> 01:02:44,260
Since your room
is connected to the terrace.

1402
01:02:44,343 --> 01:02:45,386
Okay.

1403
01:02:45,470 --> 01:02:47,513
-Hold on, let me put this down.
-Okay.

1404
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:48,681
[Seung-li] Be right there.

1405
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:50,016
-[Ji-su] Okay.
-[Seung-li] Okay.

1406
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:53,186
-Hey, this place is nice.
-[Ji-su] Yeah.

1407
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:55,146
-[Seung-li] My first time coming here.
-Me too.

1408
01:02:55,229 --> 01:02:57,315
-[Eun-ji] I'm glad they get to talk.
-[In-guk] Yeah.

1409
01:02:58,274 --> 01:03:00,193
[Seung-li] What do you do on days off?

1410
01:03:00,276 --> 01:03:02,111
-I rest. Mmm.
-Do you stay at home like this?

1411
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:03,738
-Just lounge around?
-Yeah.

1412
01:03:03,821 --> 01:03:05,406
I rest, like today.

1413
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:07,950
-Today…
-Just lying on the beanbag.

1414
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:09,327
-Laid around all day?
-Yeah.

1415
01:03:09,410 --> 01:03:11,412
-Yeah, you kept sleeping.
-Yeah.

1416
01:03:11,496 --> 01:03:13,664
You remember who brought
that pillow to you yesterday?

1417
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:16,959
I know. I woke up
when you brought me the pillow.

1418
01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:18,252
[both chuckle]

1419
01:03:18,336 --> 01:03:19,837
LAST NIGHT

1420
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:21,923
[charming whimsical music playing]

1421
01:03:27,595 --> 01:03:29,096
[indistinct chatter]

1422
01:03:29,180 --> 01:03:30,723
[Seung-li] Here, take this.

1423
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:32,016
[groggily] Huh?

1424
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:33,601
Lie down like this.

1425
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:38,523
[Eun-ji] Oh, Seung-li
always takes care of her,

1426
01:03:38,606 --> 01:03:40,358
-just in a nonchalant way.
-[Han-na] Right.

1427
01:03:41,943 --> 01:03:45,029
I didn't really need it, but I took it
because you brought it. [chuckles]

1428
01:03:45,112 --> 01:03:46,781
Oh, really? Well, I'm glad you took it.

1429
01:03:46,864 --> 01:03:49,158
-I would've been embarrassed.
-Yeah, that's why I took it.

1430
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:52,119
I thought about putting it aside,
but I didn't want to embarrass you.

1431
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:54,121
-I'm so thankful.
-[laughs]

1432
01:03:54,205 --> 01:03:55,706
Thank you so much.

1433
01:03:56,457 --> 01:03:58,459
I didn't want to, but I took it.

1434
01:03:58,543 --> 01:04:00,044
[both chuckling]

1435
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:02,046
Well, I'm glad--

1436
01:04:02,129 --> 01:04:05,132
I don't care about the other guys
that much, you know?

1437
01:04:05,216 --> 01:04:06,342
[chuckles]

1438
01:04:06,884 --> 01:04:08,970
-You don't care about them?
-Yeah.

1439
01:04:09,053 --> 01:04:13,015
But you cared about several people
in the beginning. Like, three or four.

1440
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:15,268
There weren't four. I had three.

1441
01:04:15,351 --> 01:04:17,186
Well, you can't help that you're popular.

1442
01:04:17,770 --> 01:04:18,855
Whatever.

1443
01:04:19,939 --> 01:04:22,817
I think, out of all
of the conversations we've had,

1444
01:04:23,401 --> 01:04:24,819
I like this one best.

1445
01:04:24,902 --> 01:04:27,405
Because you were the one
who asked to talk.

1446
01:04:27,488 --> 01:04:28,823
[mellow music playing]

1447
01:04:28,906 --> 01:04:30,074
Oh, really?

1448
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:32,952
Have I never asked to talk?

1449
01:04:33,035 --> 01:04:33,911
No.

1450
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:37,123
This is the first time.
Toilet paper was the excuse.

1451
01:04:37,206 --> 01:04:40,459
-Oh, really?
-It wasn't just an excuse?

1452
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:42,628
Maybe you really need some.

1453
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:46,048
It was really cool though.
I was like, "She's asking me to talk?"

1454
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:49,510
-Yeah.
-I was happy and moved, and excited.

1455
01:04:49,594 --> 01:04:52,054
All three emotions, all at once.

1456
01:04:55,182 --> 01:04:58,477
-Can I tell you something very honest?
-Yeah.

1457
01:04:58,561 --> 01:04:59,520
[Seung-li] I always…

1458
01:05:00,438 --> 01:05:03,774
finished my testimonials
earlier than everyone else.

1459
01:05:04,442 --> 01:05:06,444
People kept saying, "It's complicated."

1460
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:09,447
"Oh, I need to think about it more."

1461
01:05:09,530 --> 01:05:12,658
But my testimonials
always ended really early.

1462
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:13,576
Because…

1463
01:05:15,453 --> 01:05:18,289
they'd ask,
"Who's your first impression choice?"

1464
01:05:18,372 --> 01:05:21,292
And I'd say, "Kang Ji-su."
And the second time too.

1465
01:05:21,375 --> 01:05:24,629
"Are you sure it's Ji-su?" I said,
"Kang Ji-su. Kang Ji-su. Kang Ji-su."

1466
01:05:25,171 --> 01:05:27,340
WHO LEFT THE BIGGEST
FIRST IMPRESSION ON YOU?

1467
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:28,382
Ji-su.

1468
01:05:28,466 --> 01:05:30,092
[enchanting music playing]

1469
01:05:30,176 --> 01:05:32,178
I think Ji-su is my top choice.

1470
01:05:33,012 --> 01:05:34,221
Like the first time,

1471
01:05:34,847 --> 01:05:37,725
ever since the first time,
it's always been the same.

1472
01:05:37,808 --> 01:05:39,393
Ji-su is still number one.

1473
01:05:40,561 --> 01:05:42,647
Ji-su is still my top choice.

1474
01:05:43,397 --> 01:05:46,859
I think my feelings for Ji-su have grown.

1475
01:05:47,652 --> 01:05:48,611
[inhales]

1476
01:05:48,694 --> 01:05:54,825
My first impression choice was Ji-su,
and it's always been Ji-su since then.

1477
01:05:54,909 --> 01:05:55,910
[inhales]

1478
01:05:56,827 --> 01:05:58,371
You'll see in my interviews.

1479
01:05:59,246 --> 01:06:02,959
When you watch my interviews,
you'll see how honest I am.

1480
01:06:04,251 --> 01:06:07,129
But I didn't show any interest
in you at first.

1481
01:06:08,464 --> 01:06:11,509
Why do you think
your feelings never changed?

1482
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:13,886
I just couldn't help it.

1483
01:06:13,970 --> 01:06:15,346
[enchanting music playing]

1484
01:06:15,429 --> 01:06:16,347
Oh.

1485
01:06:16,889 --> 01:06:21,644
But when someone isn't being friendly,
it's understandable to look elsewhere.

1486
01:06:22,311 --> 01:06:23,646
[Seung-li] I didn't.

1487
01:06:23,729 --> 01:06:26,023
-[Ji-su] Oh, really?
-I guess I'm just weird.

1488
01:06:26,107 --> 01:06:27,316
[laughs]

1489
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,777
-[Eun-ji] He speaks plainly, but clearly.
-[Han-na] Mmm.

1490
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:31,654
You don't need to read into what he says.

1491
01:06:31,737 --> 01:06:33,906
-He tells it like it is. Yeah.
-It's direct.

1492
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:36,617
-And Seung-li always uses kind words.
-[Eun-ji] He does.

1493
01:06:36,701 --> 01:06:38,953
He doesn't make her feel confused.

1494
01:06:39,620 --> 01:06:40,830
What did you say…

1495
01:06:41,539 --> 01:06:43,582
What did you talk about
in your pre-interview?

1496
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:45,710
-Therapy.
-Therapy?

1497
01:06:45,793 --> 01:06:46,836
I told you.

1498
01:06:46,919 --> 01:06:49,005
Oh, you don't remember, do you?

1499
01:06:49,088 --> 01:06:51,716
[slurring] Let's… change topics.

1500
01:06:51,799 --> 01:06:52,633
[chuckles]

1501
01:06:55,594 --> 01:06:57,096
Oh, he's in big trouble.

1502
01:06:57,179 --> 01:06:58,681
-No!
-Oh, hey!

1503
01:06:59,890 --> 01:07:02,143
I can't believe you forgot about that.

1504
01:07:02,226 --> 01:07:04,061
No, I remember… I do.

1505
01:07:04,145 --> 01:07:05,730
Because during our secret date,

1506
01:07:05,813 --> 01:07:08,566
I told you the things
we discussed in therapy.

1507
01:07:08,649 --> 01:07:11,235
You don't remember that,
do you? [chuckles]

1508
01:07:11,318 --> 01:07:13,112
-I do.
-What was it?

1509
01:07:13,612 --> 01:07:14,572
Therapy.

1510
01:07:15,197 --> 01:07:16,365
[scoffs] Oh, you're drunk.

1511
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:18,117
-[chuckles] Argh.
-You are.

1512
01:07:19,285 --> 01:07:20,911
-No, I--
-During our secret date,

1513
01:07:20,995 --> 01:07:22,204
-I told you…
-Yeah.

1514
01:07:22,288 --> 01:07:24,915
…why I wanted to be
with a reliable person.

1515
01:07:24,999 --> 01:07:26,667
[low dramatic music playing]

1516
01:07:26,751 --> 01:07:31,338
So I personally think
I'm quite an unstable person.

1517
01:07:31,422 --> 01:07:34,341
Because I had
some really good memories with people,

1518
01:07:34,425 --> 01:07:37,595
but also bad ones that really hurt me.

1519
01:07:37,678 --> 01:07:39,638
So I'm quite defensive.

1520
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:41,849
Because I have that kind of anxiety,

1521
01:07:41,932 --> 01:07:44,602
I want to be with someone
who can be stable

1522
01:07:44,685 --> 01:07:47,229
when my emotions
are really out of control.

1523
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:50,399
That's why I say,
"I like reliable people."

1524
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:54,236
It's natural that you feel that way.

1525
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:55,946
-Of course.
-That must be tiring.

1526
01:07:58,199 --> 01:08:00,576
-[Han-na] This was important.
-[In-guk] He's in big trouble.

1527
01:08:01,118 --> 01:08:03,496
Because Ji-su
had shared something really big.

1528
01:08:03,579 --> 01:08:05,289
Seung-li doesn't know
what to do right now.

1529
01:08:05,372 --> 01:08:07,333
-[Han-na] Ugh… Oh, no.
-[Eun-ji exclaims]

1530
01:08:07,416 --> 01:08:09,043
[Han-na] This is pretty serious.

1531
01:08:09,627 --> 01:08:11,879
Do you remember what we talked about
on our secret date?

1532
01:08:11,962 --> 01:08:13,631
-I do.
-Tell me.

1533
01:08:13,714 --> 01:08:15,049
-Our secret date?
-Yeah.

1534
01:08:17,218 --> 01:08:18,636
You… Because…

1535
01:08:20,179 --> 01:08:22,098
Because you're so busy, you get…

1536
01:08:22,181 --> 01:08:23,057
[scoffs]

1537
01:08:23,140 --> 01:08:25,267
Like, because you're always busy, you…

1538
01:08:25,351 --> 01:08:26,644
[tense music playing]

1539
01:08:26,727 --> 01:08:29,855
Like how… [hesitates] When you have to
listen to other people's stories,

1540
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:35,444
your mind gets jumbled and things,
because you're also really busy, right?

1541
01:08:37,613 --> 01:08:38,948
[scoffs] Oh, gosh…

1542
01:08:44,578 --> 01:08:45,454
[music fades]

1543
01:08:45,538 --> 01:08:46,539
You're making it up.

1544
01:08:47,039 --> 01:08:48,916
Just tell me again.

1545
01:08:48,999 --> 01:08:53,170
Tell me so I can listen carefully,
one more time.

1546
01:08:53,254 --> 01:08:54,088
Hey.

1547
01:08:54,171 --> 01:08:55,297
[dramatic music playing]

1548
01:08:55,381 --> 01:08:57,758
-[incredulously] Seriously?
-No, please tell me.

1549
01:08:59,593 --> 01:09:00,761
Can you tell me again?

1550
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:02,555
Just once.

1551
01:09:05,182 --> 01:09:06,392
Are you serious?

1552
01:09:06,475 --> 01:09:07,601
You forgot?

1553
01:09:07,685 --> 01:09:09,353
I'm trying not to mess this up.

1554
01:09:10,104 --> 01:09:12,148
[scoffs] I can't believe this.

1555
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:14,483
[sighs in exasperation]

1556
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:17,027
Ji-su, come on… I don't wanna…

1557
01:09:17,111 --> 01:09:19,280
[inhales] mess up.

1558
01:09:23,784 --> 01:09:26,495
I told Seung-li about certain experiences,

1559
01:09:27,079 --> 01:09:29,915
things I'm still really sensitive about,

1560
01:09:30,499 --> 01:09:32,459
but he didn't remember what I told him.

1561
01:09:34,962 --> 01:09:37,131
Now I feel even more uncertain about him.

1562
01:09:37,965 --> 01:09:39,967
[dramatic music continues]
