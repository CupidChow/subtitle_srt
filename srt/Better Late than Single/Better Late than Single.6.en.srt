1
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,052
See you in a bit.

2
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:16,266
[door lock beeps]

3
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:19,728
[clicks tongue] They must be
getting back from their date.

4
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:20,812
[Han-na and Eun-ji] Hmm.

5
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:24,482
Ugh, let's wash up.

6
00:00:26,985 --> 00:00:29,946
I've been wanting to
talk to him since this morning

7
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:34,409
because I had left a letter
in his mailbox yesterday.

8
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:36,995
I just wanted to talk to him about that,

9
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:40,040
but I couldn't find the courage,

10
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:42,584
so I kept putting it off
until the evening.

11
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:46,212
When will I get to talk to him one-on-one?

12
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:49,340
I should just ask him to go on a date
so we can talk.

13
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:53,261
So, I changed
and went straight to the Lounge.

14
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:55,805
Yeah, you need to make time.

15
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,807
She found her courage. That's great.

16
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:00,477
[intriguing music playing]

17
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:04,355
[Yeo-myung] I went to the Lounge,

18
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:08,651
and I wanted to sit next to
or at least close to Jeong-mok.

19
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:13,198
So, I can finally sum up the courage
and ask him, "Do you want to talk?"

20
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:17,410
Sadly,

21
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:19,537
he was sitting with Do.

22
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,748
One of my quirks is
I always have to pair cake with…

23
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:23,458
[Yeo-myung] That crushed me.

24
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:24,876
[Do] So…

25
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:27,545
[Yeo-myung] I was sitting
with Min-hong, so I asked…

26
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,048
Can we talk?

27
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:31,132
[music fades]

28
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:35,178
-Where?
-Here?

29
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:37,263
Maybe…

30
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:38,389
The Caravan?

31
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:39,933
-I like the Caravan.
-Caravan.

32
00:01:40,016 --> 00:01:41,059
Let's go to the Caravan.

33
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:43,812
I think she's looking for
some advice from Min-hong.

34
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:46,314
I feel like such a loser now.

35
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:48,399
-I want advice.
-I feel like such a fucking loser.

36
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:50,777
-I really… I don't know what to do.
-[Eun-ji] Oh, my.

37
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:54,280
-Oh, no girl! Oh, that Min-hong…
-Min-hong! Min-hong doesn't hold back.

38
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:57,075
-I was way too honest back there.
-No worries, dude. Let's sit here.

39
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:58,618
But they like the same guy.

40
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:00,537
You're right. It's quite the duo.

41
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,457
[Min-hong] You can ask me
anything you want.

42
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,501
[Yeo-myung] Min-hong. Min-hong.

43
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:08,503
I…

44
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:11,756
-I want to talk to you about Jeong-mok.
-Mmm.

45
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,177
I've been dying to ask him
on a date since yesterday, but--

46
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:18,346
If you don't ask him,
I'm taking him. [chuckles]

47
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:19,556
-[chuckles]
-[Cupids exclaim]

48
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:21,057
[Min-hong] No, I'm serious.

49
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,809
-Seriously, girl.
-I'm being such a loser.

50
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:25,770
You know we're competing
for the same guy, right? Goodness.

51
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:28,148
You're being too much right now.

52
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:30,400
-[whimsical music playing]
-[both laughing]

53
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:33,278
You don't see me
as competition at all, huh?

54
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,238
No, it's not about competing.

55
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,991
You're the only person
who understands my situation.

56
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:39,993
-Really? Oh, I'm so flattered.
-Yeah.

57
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,287
All right, I guess it's okay.

58
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:43,705
[both laugh]

59
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,958
Yeo-myung has to be really desperate.

60
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:50,420
Seriously. She must've been dying
to ask Min-hong to talk.

61
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:51,921
[music fades]

62
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:54,424
[Seung-li] Nice.

63
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:01,347
Let's go outside.

64
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:02,765
[Han-na] Oh.

65
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:06,853
-Okay. Where should we go? Any preference?
-Anywhere. Anywhere outside is fine.

66
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:09,230
-Cool. I'll leave this here.
-[Han-na] Smooth move.

67
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:10,940
-[Jeong-mok] Sounds good.
-Later.

68
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:11,983
-Hmm.
-[Sang-ho] See ya.

69
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:12,984
That's mine.

70
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:14,903
[cheerful music playing]

71
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:17,155
[Do] Where do you think we should sit?

72
00:03:17,238 --> 00:03:18,698
[Jeong-mok] Maybe back there?

73
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:19,616
[music fades]

74
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,326
I'm just so bummed, dude.

75
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:24,996
-Like, I had a really good time yesterday.
-Mmm.

76
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,080
But I was…

77
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:29,375
-kind of worried only I felt this way.
-Mmm.

78
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,795
I tried being honest with him
and really try and talk to him.

79
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,131
And actually express how I feel.

80
00:03:35,214 --> 00:03:37,467
-[Do] Yeah.
-[Jeong-mok] There's a spot there. There.

81
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:39,302
-[Car] They saw them.
-[Eun-ji] It's them?

82
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:40,720
-[Han-na] Oh, no.
-Wow.

83
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:43,556
-[Han-na] They both saw Do and Jeong-mok.
-[Eun-ji] They did.

84
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,892
-[Car] My God.
-[In-guk] That's a cruel twist of fate.

85
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:47,894
[gripping music playing]

86
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:50,271
-[Do] Oh. Yep.
-[Jeong-mok] Is this… the right way?

87
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:52,732
[Yeo-myung] Min-hong.

88
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,109
What am I going to do?

89
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,029
[Eun-ji and Han-na exclaim]

90
00:03:58,112 --> 00:04:01,532
We're talking in the Caravan
and, suddenly, there they were…

91
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,826
Jeong-mok and Do.

92
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,037
They went to the Rooftop.

93
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:09,040
We both looked at each other
and said, "Oh…

94
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:10,959
what now?"

95
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,585
[gripping music continues]

96
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:16,339
-Where are they going?
-Rooftop.

97
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:22,887
What if they stay up there?

98
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,639
Ugh, I'm so upset.

99
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:26,891
Hey, you're not the only one, sister.

100
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:30,979
[music ends]

101
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,230
[Do humming]

102
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:33,564
Were our dates…

103
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:34,983
satisfying?

104
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:37,151
-Ah. I was quite…
-Mmm.

105
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:39,696
-…satisfied. I really enjoyed it.
-Mmm.

106
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,406
Ms. Yi, I just…

107
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,534
-wasn't sure you were enjoying yourself.
-"Ms. Yi."

108
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,160
-Ah… Yes.
-I was worried about that.

109
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:49,122
-I've been saying I enjoyed it. I did.
-Oh, right. You did say, yeah.

110
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:50,248
It's just,

111
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:52,375
-I've been thinking about the way I…
-Mmm.

112
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,835
…treat people.

113
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:55,545
-Like Ji-yeon…
-Mmm.

114
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:58,047
-…Yeo-myung, or Min-hong.
-Mmm.

115
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,091
It's so much easier for me

116
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:02,760
to talk to women
when I'm not emotionally invested.

117
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:03,678
[Do] Mmm.

118
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:06,848
But whenever you're around me,

119
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:09,892
-I suddenly don't know what to say.
-Mmm.

120
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,061
I start feeling
very self-critical and nervous.

121
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,229
[Do] Mmm.

122
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:16,024
I kept thinking,
"Was I a buzzkill?" [chuckles]

123
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,859
-You weren't a buzzkill.
-Really?

124
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:19,068
-Mmm.
-I was worried.

125
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:21,529
I want you to like me.

126
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:24,741
-So…
-Ah…

127
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:27,118
I just kept overthinking things.

128
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,287
-I was anxious.
-I see.

129
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,204
Real talk.

130
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,457
-I honestly didn't notice at all.
-Yeah.

131
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,044
-[Do] Mmm.
-[Han-na] He's loving this.

132
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:39,380
If we go on a date tomorrow,
who would you pick?

133
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:43,426
If I can, I'm picking you.

134
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:45,511
Aw.

135
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,346
-[chuckles]
-[Han-na] Another date.

136
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,599
You're whimpering again. [laughs]

137
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,684
-I hear you whimpering.
-[whimpers]

138
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:53,394
[sighs swooningly]

139
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:55,146
-[charming music playing]
-[chuckles]

140
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:56,647
[Do] Mmm.

141
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:00,943
We should go bowling again.

142
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:04,822
Yeah. I've so got the bowling bug
and I will definitely be going back.

143
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,240
I just need to practice…

144
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:08,076
-Mmm.
-…so we can actually win.

145
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:13,998
That Caravan is great.

146
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,708
-Hmm?
-It's kind of soundproof.

147
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,001
-Is it really?
-Total privacy.

148
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:20,254
It muffles the sound inside
and it's super soft and comfy.

149
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:22,423
-You need to check it out sometime.
-Okay.

150
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:24,842
We should've gone there instead.

151
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,469
[soft whimsical music playing]

152
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:27,762
[Yeo-myung] Why so long?

153
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:30,181
Dude this shit's hilarious.

154
00:06:30,264 --> 00:06:31,349
-[chuckles]
-Yeah.

155
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:34,894
Dude, I'm in a really vulnerable place
right now and feel so confused.

156
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:36,479
I'm losing my shit over here.

157
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:39,148
-All because you want to talk to this guy.
-Mmm.

158
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,358
[plastic bottle popping]

159
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:48,533
I became interested
in Jeong-mok. [chuckles]

160
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,994
I thought it would be nice
if Jeong-mok came along.

161
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:55,248
I've been wanting to go on a date
with Jeong-mok the whole time,

162
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:58,167
so I tried to pick his name, but I failed.

163
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:01,212
I thought it was a bit of a shame.

164
00:07:01,295 --> 00:07:03,339
I wanted to talk to Jeong-mok…

165
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:05,133
-[solemn music playing]
-[sniffles]

166
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:07,176
…but I didn't get to.

167
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:12,348
Hey. Is it bedtime?

168
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:15,101
I think I'll skate a bit. Any takers?

169
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:21,065
[Eun-ji] Oh, he stayed back
for Jae-yun's sake.

170
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,900
[Han-na] He was trying to help him.

171
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:26,154
Even throughout
the remainder of the night,

172
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:28,573
I never stopped trying to sit next to him.

173
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:29,490
LAST NIGHT

174
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:32,160
[Do] The bowling date was so fun.
I scored a strike.

175
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:34,745
Seriously, you guys,
it was everything I dreamed of.

176
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:38,249
So, like, why are you
always wearing a jacket?

177
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:39,709
Are you trying to look cool?

178
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,919
-Oh. I mean, I could…
-[Yeo-myung] Yeah.

179
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,838
-Yes, but--
-But I think it might rain.

180
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:47,675
[Yeo-myung] I wanted to talk to him a lot,

181
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:50,052
but I didn't get to much.

182
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:54,390
But I was really happy heading out
for the double date today

183
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,225
because I was going with Jeong-mok.

184
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,728
I thought a lot about
spending time with him,

185
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,646
but we ate separately.

186
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,358
Do you want Korean food? Rice?

187
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:07,195
-Or stews and barbecue?
-[Jeong-mok] Something like that.

188
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,822
Pay… Pay attention, please.

189
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,908
But Western food would be nice too.

190
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,576
Or pork cutlets?

191
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,119
How about spicy pork?

192
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:17,413
-[Jeong-mok] But do we get to pick?
-[grunts]

193
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:21,209
-[Hyun-kyu] It's okay.
-[Jeong-mok] What do you wanna eat?

194
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:24,545
The last couple of days,
I've been waiting patiently

195
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,756
for the right opportunity to ask him out.

196
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,424
But… but I…

197
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,426
I think I might have missed my window.

198
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:37,683
-[Jeong-mok] We should go. Go ahead.
-[Do] Can I ask you something?

199
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,437
-Yeah… Hmm?
-I know it might sound weird, but…

200
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:43,439
-this is my point of view.
-Hmm.

201
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:47,568
I don't think guys, in terms of
their romantic feelings for a girl…

202
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:48,486
[Jeong-mok] Mm-hmm.

203
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,947
-[Do] They don't really go…
-Yeah.

204
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:54,033
-…from, like, zero to one, you know?
-Yeah.

205
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:57,703
I do think they can go
from one to five, or even ten.

206
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,038
-Hmm.
-What do you think?

207
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,706
[Jeong-mok] I agree.

208
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,084
I think it needs something to grow from.

209
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,003
-It's gradual.
-Right?

210
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:06,921
-Mm-hmm.
-Mmm.

211
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:10,174
[Do] I was wondering if it was
just me who felt that way.

212
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:12,093
-Oh, man.
-[Eun-ji] They're passing by again.

213
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:14,679
-I just really want to stay--
-It's them. Give me a sec.

214
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:15,596
Go, girl.

215
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,515
[Han-na] Oh. Yeo-myung is ready.

216
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:20,142
-[Min-hong] Let me know how it goes.
-[Yeo-myung] I'll call you.

217
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,061
[gripping music playing]

218
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:25,189
[Yeo-myung] I was just waiting
for their conversation to end.

219
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,858
I couldn't just let things stay this way.

220
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,696
True. I guess I was right
about Hyun-kyu after all.

221
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:34,740
[Han-na] Is she
really gonna take him from her?

222
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:37,535
-[Do] Let's go to the Lounge.
-You done talking? You finished?

223
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:38,953
I… Yeah.

224
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:41,539
Yes. Take him. I didn't mean
to hog him or anything. Sorry.

225
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:43,457
-Can we talk?
-Yes. Sure.

226
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,376
-[Jeong-mok] Let's go.
-Yeah.

227
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:46,877
Where do you think we should go?

228
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,379
Oh, what?

229
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:50,590
-She's so cool. So brave.
-[Han-na] Wow, Yeo-myung.

230
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:51,674
She's so bold.

231
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:54,385
-You see how flustered Do was?
-[Han-na] She was caught off guard.

232
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:56,262
[enthralling music playing]

233
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:58,472
We've never really gotten to talk before.

234
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:00,683
-I wanted to change that.
-I see. Really?

235
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,603
-Thanks for the letter.
-You read it?

236
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,730
-I did, this morning.
-How'd you feel?

237
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:08,774
-[Yeo-myung chuckles]
-I just felt…

238
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:11,986
THIS MORNING

239
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:12,903
TO JEONG-MOK

240
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:15,573
I'M NOT GOOD AT CLAW MACHINES
LET'S GO ON A DATE NEXT TIME

241
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,618
[In-guk] This can't be easy for Jeong-mok.

242
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:20,453
[Car] Yeo-myung has her chance now.

243
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:24,123
Things have been so hectic
and nonstop since we started.

244
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:30,254
So I kept looking for an opportunity
to talk to you, but… [chuckles]

245
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:36,344
I was sad 'cause…
[chuckles] I was too shy to ask you.

246
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,888
And now, I just kidnapped you. [chuckles]

247
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:39,889
[music ends]

248
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:43,225
[chuckles]

249
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,978
Would you be interested

250
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:49,190
in going on a date with me? [sniffles]

251
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,525
[Jeong-mok] Mmm…

252
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:54,612
"Interested."

253
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:57,114
-I want to get to know everyone.
-Mmm.

254
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,201
I… I do.

255
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,036
I do, but…

256
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:05,915
[inhales] Actually,

257
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:07,917
-I don't know. I've never…
-Mmm.

258
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,962
I've never been in this situation before,
so I don't really know what to do.

259
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:14,715
-And I also went on a date with Min-hong.
-Mmm.

260
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:17,635
To be honest, talking to Min-hong

261
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:19,470
-felt so comfortable and easy for me.
-Yeah.

262
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:22,056
It was… really nice.

263
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:23,557
It makes me wonder

264
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:26,352
if I'm romantically attracted to her.

265
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:27,478
Oh.

266
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,939
I mean, I definitely like her as…

267
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:30,940
-Mmm.
-…a person.

268
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:33,067
However,

269
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:37,696
romantic attraction could
also be something completely different.

270
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,614
[Yeo-myung] Mmm.

271
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,076
So, is there anyone

272
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:44,995
you think
you're romantically attracted to?

273
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:47,540
Um…

274
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:48,916
There is.

275
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:51,627
-Is it Do?
-It might be…

276
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,087
-Yeah. Do.
-Mmm.

277
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:57,341
Is there anyone else?

278
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,470
-I don't think so.
-Mmm.

279
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:06,183
It looks like you might've
already made up your mind. Right?

280
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:07,810
I mean, kind of.

281
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:10,146
-Any chance your feelings could change?
-Well…

282
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:12,857
I mean, I can't say for sure.

283
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:14,942
Right?

284
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:16,861
-You can't?
-I just can't really say.

285
00:12:16,944 --> 00:12:17,778
[Yeo-myung] Mmm.

286
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:20,948
[clicks tongue]

287
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:28,164
So, from the people here…

288
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,667
-I mean…
-Mmm.

289
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:35,212
Well…

290
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:37,882
I was just most attracted to you.

291
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:40,050
-Really?
-Yeah.

292
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,135
[gentle music playing]

293
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:42,136
I mean,

294
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,139
we never went on a one-on-one date.

295
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:49,351
And, well, we haven't talked much.

296
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,437
But still…

297
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:54,273
I've become… [giggling]

298
00:12:57,318 --> 00:13:00,279
well, interested in you.

299
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,534
[enchanting music playing]

300
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,495
-[chuckles]
-This… this is hard.

301
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:09,788
You don't…

302
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:11,290
-You don't…
-What?

303
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,125
…feel that way about the others?

304
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:15,794
Yeah.

305
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,924
You're it… for me.

306
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:23,427
[upbeat enchanting music playing]

307
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,559
[music fades]

308
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:37,525
Right, but romantic attraction…

309
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:49,620
Wait, what's wrong?

310
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,130
[emotionally] I just feel bad.

311
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:02,299
[chuckles] Oh. 'Cause you're not into me?

312
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:04,426
[gentle wistful music playing]

313
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:07,721
-I don't know what to do. I mean…
-Hey, what's wrong?

314
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:10,933
-Why are you crying? Mm-hmm.
-I'm so thankful you're interested in me.

315
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:13,561
-Gosh, it's just we have so little time…
-Mmm.

316
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:14,478
[clicks tongue]

317
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:18,524
And, yeah, funny enough,
I just had this exact same conversation,

318
00:14:18,607 --> 00:14:20,442
-you know, with Do.
-Mm-hmm?

319
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,278
We agreed a person's attraction

320
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:24,905
-can go from one to five, or ten.
-Mmm.

321
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:28,492
But can somebody really go
from zero to one?

322
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:30,619
-Mmm.
-Or something… like that.

323
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,037
So, does this mean I'm a zero?

324
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:35,207
Oh, that's not… What I just… I mean…

325
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,043
It's kind of…

326
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:44,717
Well…

327
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:47,678
I'm zero?

328
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:49,555
Point five?

329
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,557
[Yeo-myung chuckles]

330
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:54,602
[music fades]

331
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,021
[sighs heavily]

332
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:12,828
You're not a zero. Trust me.

333
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:14,997
Not a zero.

334
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,333
If that's the case…

335
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,834
[hopeful music playing]

336
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,045
-…I think I'll continue…
-Mmm.

337
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:26,133
…expressing the romantic emotions

338
00:15:26,216 --> 00:15:28,093
that I feel towards you.

339
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:31,764
If you are into me,

340
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:34,308
then what's meant to be will be.

341
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:39,897
Oh, man. It's hard to look at you.

342
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:41,941
No, it's okay.

343
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:44,234
I really appreciate your honesty.

344
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:46,654
It couldn't have been easy for you.

345
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,822
Well, that's… what I wanted to say.

346
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:51,867
Thanks for being so brave.

347
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:56,914
[chuckles]

348
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,167
[music fades]

349
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:05,422
-[Jeong-mok] Let's go.
-[Yeo-myung] Okay. [chuckling]

350
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:10,010
I'm calling it a night.

351
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,220
-Sounds good.
-Okay.

352
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,638
-Good night.
-Night.

353
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:13,931
[Yeo-myung chuckles]

354
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:20,896
[sighs]

355
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:22,481
[clicks tongue]

356
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:26,986
[door lock beeping]

357
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:38,038
[crying]

358
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:41,542
[gentle melancholic music playing]

359
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:43,335
-[Han-na] Aw.
-Oh…

360
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:47,381
Guys, she was holding back her tears
the whole time.

361
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:48,549
[Yeo-myung sniffling]

362
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:01,603
[crying]

363
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:08,861
[sighs in exasperation]

364
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:12,614
[Yeo-myung] I finally broke down in tears.

365
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:17,828
I had patiently waited so long
for this opportunity to talk to him.

366
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:23,000
I just kept asking myself
the same question,

367
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:24,585
"Do I even have a shot with him?"

368
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:25,753
Are you done talking?

369
00:17:27,046 --> 00:17:30,090
But before I could even attempt anything,

370
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,675
he just shut me out.

371
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:34,970
It was such a painful thing to experience.

372
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,638
Feeling rejected is awful.

373
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:42,728
[tearfully] Mom.

374
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:43,854
[sniffles]

375
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:49,318
No, it's not that at all.

376
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:53,947
I'm just feeling
really sad about being rejected.

377
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:56,950
[cries]

378
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,036
Oh, I don't know.

379
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:03,248
After hearing me cry over the phone,

380
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:06,251
my mom sent this long
and very sweet message.

381
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,462
"You're very pretty, cute, and charming."

382
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:10,672
"Cheer up. I'm always rooting for you."

383
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,258
Her message
was exactly what I needed to hear.

384
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:19,598
[music ends]

385
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:21,183
[sighs]

386
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,272
-[sighs] So, after four long days…
-[Car] Oh, man.

387
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:29,191
…Yeo-myung finally worked up the courage

388
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:31,819
to talk to Jeong-mok
and confess her feelings for him.

389
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:32,736
Yeah.

390
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,239
[Han-na] Only to be left
feeling rejected and in tears.

391
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:38,117
He didn't give her even a bit of hope.

392
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,159
Seriously.

393
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,328
But I kind of feel
that Jeong-mok's emotions

394
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:44,498
could potentially change
in the coming days.

395
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,208
You think he could fall for Yeo-myung?

396
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:48,252
See, he hasn't viewed Yeo-myung…

397
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:50,254
as an option.

398
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:51,839
She's just another person to him.

399
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:53,173
-[Han-na] Right.
-Yeah.

400
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:56,009
He didn't think of her as an option,
since his roommate had mentioned

401
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,219
-that he was into her.
-Yeah.

402
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,596
-He was being respectful.
-Jeong-mok looked the other way.

403
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:02,808
Although, now I think he's going to
view her in a very different light.

404
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:04,518
-[Eun-ji] Definitely.
-[Han-na] I see.

405
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:05,936
He'll be open to the possibility.

406
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:08,397
Yeah, I think there's
the beginning of a spark there,

407
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,275
but the question is
whether that turns into a flame.

408
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:12,776
We just don't know.

409
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,112
[Seung-li] What should we do today?

410
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,158
-We got a text. Oh, tonight's…
-[Min-hong] What's this?

411
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:20,659
-Tarot?
-[Ji-yeon] A tarot reading.

412
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:23,328
It's Tarot Night! Man, I go crazy
for mystic stuff like this.

413
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,455
The key to tarot
is avoiding the Tower card.

414
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,332
A crumbling tower is a bad omen.

415
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,961
-[Sang-ho] I'm down for this. Why not?
-[Hyun-kyu] Our fortunes read? Okay.

416
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:33,005
[Han-na] Wow. Is a tarot expert coming?

417
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,966
I think a tarot card reading
is perfect right now.

418
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:38,594
-[Han-na] Should be fun.
-This tarot reader looks professional.

419
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:39,887
[In-guk] Yeah.

420
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:42,723
-[ethereal music playing]
-[resonant chiming]

421
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:44,308
[Eun-ji] Oh, she has a singing bowl.

422
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,062
TAROT NIGHT

423
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:51,815
-[Do] My gosh. Why is it so pretty here?
-Yes.

424
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,442
-Isn't it? Yes.
-Yeah.

425
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,777
You suit this space well.

426
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,738
Oh, thank you so much.

427
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:01,533
Put your left hand on the deck,
and directly talk to them.

428
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:02,910
Tell me what you want to know.

429
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:06,413
-This is… the fourth day.
-Yes.

430
00:20:06,496 --> 00:20:10,167
And we have probably around
the same amount of time remaining.

431
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:14,254
Do people's romantic feelings ever change?

432
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:16,089
All right, let's have a look here.

433
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,219
Hmm…

434
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:24,056
What will happen to people's
romantic feelings in the next four days?

435
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:26,099
These emotions are still forming.

436
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:29,102
So, this means nothing
is really set in stone yet.

437
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:31,605
However, it does say
that everyone's feelings

438
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:35,234
will soon start the process
of solidifying themselves.

439
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:37,778
You were curious about your own feelings.

440
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:42,658
It says that your feelings will be settled
a bit quicker than everyone else's.

441
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:43,909
Mmm.

442
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:45,285
[mellow music playing]

443
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:47,079
-[Do] I think up till now…
-Yes.

444
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:49,498
…I had focused most of my attention

445
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,084
on the person I initially liked.

446
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:54,795
However, I think today was different

447
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:58,006
because I focused on the person
who's actually interested in me.

448
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,593
That change in perspective
put me in a better place.

449
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,387
I immediately thought to myself,

450
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,681
"Maybe she's talking about that."

451
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:07,557
[music fades]

452
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,601
Do you have any other questions for me?

453
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:13,272
So, what you're saying is that

454
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:16,275
-a person's romantic feelings can go…
-Mmm?

455
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,193
…from zero to one?

456
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:21,071
[mellow music playing]

457
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:23,282
[Do] I just wanted one last moment

458
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:26,618
to figure out how
I'm really feeling about Seung-li.

459
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:27,744
I mean,

460
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:30,956
realizing that I went all day
without thinking about him once,

461
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,042
that felt huge
and had me questioning everything.

462
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:37,713
So I… needed to double-check
in order to be certain.

463
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:40,424
[music fades]

464
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:43,802
-[tarot reader] We set this here…
-[Han-na] What did it say?

465
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:48,307
Oh, no. Why is it Winter?

466
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:50,726
This one is Winter too.

467
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:51,893
Let's pick again.

468
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:53,687
It's not looking too good.

469
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:55,731
Oh, the cards are pretty negative.

470
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,983
Oh, it says here things are difficult.

471
00:21:58,066 --> 00:21:59,318
[Do groans]

472
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:00,819
[tarot reader] Okay, so…

473
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:03,905
I saw those cards and I… said to myself,

474
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,283
"Oh, this isn't possible."

475
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:07,743
But then I realized,

476
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:11,997
it probably wasn't referring to
Jeong-mok since things were great.

477
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,417
I think after that moment,
I felt better about my decision.

478
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:18,045
So, Seung-li, buh-bye!

479
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:19,880
And, Jeong-mok, hi!

480
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:21,381
[giggles] Yep.

481
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,425
-[Han-na] "Bye!"
-[Car] "Buh-bye!"

482
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:25,719
-Do needed this tarot reading.
-[Car] Right?

483
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:28,180
Yeah, she was able to
clear up her feelings.

484
00:22:28,263 --> 00:22:29,514
-[Car] So true.
-[Eun-ji] Mmm.

485
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,808
[moody music playing]

486
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,772
[breathes deeply]

487
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:40,150
[smacks lips]

488
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:45,655
Are they still talking over there?
Can… you see?

489
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:47,157
They are.

490
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,533
[Seung-li sighs]

491
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,455
[Seung-li] They're taking too long, right?

492
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:54,372
[Sang-ho] Seriously.

493
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,083
-[In-guk] Oh, Hyun-kyu.
-[Seung-li] Dude…

494
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,876
-Almost an hour, right?
-[Sang-ho] Yeah.

495
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:00,629
ONE HOUR EARLIER

496
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:01,588
Can we talk?

497
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:04,091
Okay.

498
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:07,594
Oh, I see. Hyun-kyu asked her
to talk in private.

499
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:08,762
Yeah, you're right.

500
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:11,848
[Car] Oh, he's getting heated right now.
He's on fire.

501
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:13,600
[slow funky music playing]

502
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,062
[music fades]

503
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:20,482
-So, how was your date today? Because…
-My date?

504
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:22,776
A date with each of us is enough, right?

505
00:23:22,859 --> 00:23:24,277
Mmm.

506
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:25,821
Do you think I've decided?

507
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,364
-No.
-Who I like most?

508
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:29,282
No, I'm just asking you to think about it.

509
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,618
But after you have your dates,

510
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:33,829
I hope… you like me the most.

511
00:23:33,912 --> 00:23:34,913
[Ji-su exclaims]

512
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,125
I think after today, I might.

513
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,085
-You might?
-I think it's down to two.

514
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:41,837
[pensive music playing]

515
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,171
-[Hyun-kyu] Two?
-Mmm.

516
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:47,300
Now, it's you and Seung-li.

517
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:50,846
Oh… Mr. Kim Sang-ho.

518
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:53,306
-Oh, Sang-ho's been eliminated.
-[Car] Because…

519
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,516
[music fades]

520
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:55,725
-I told you.
-What?

521
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,811
-I told you, right?
-Hyun-kyu doesn't hold back.

522
00:23:57,894 --> 00:24:00,063
-This is what happens when he finds out.
-Exactly.

523
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:04,609
[Seung-li] So, from what I see,
Hyun-kyu obviously is very proactive.

524
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:05,861
Oh. Oh, very true.

525
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:08,113
-He's… not backing down.
-He really has been. Exactly.

526
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:10,323
-Seung-li is about to go to war.
-He's anxious.

527
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:11,658
-[Han-na and Eun-ji] Yeah.
-Mmm.

528
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:13,910
-I guess we just wait.
-Yeah, they'll be back.

529
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:15,078
It's not cool…

530
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:18,373
to ask her to talk
and consume all her time.

531
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:19,666
No, of course not.

532
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:24,171
-[Seung-li] What the hell, man?
-[Sang-ho] I don't know. I'm tired.

533
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:27,007
[Ji-yeon] Hello there.

534
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,466
Hello. Welcome.

535
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:31,178
[mystical music playing]

536
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:33,096
What brings you here?

537
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,264
Well…

538
00:24:34,347 --> 00:24:36,808
how the person I'm thinking about…

539
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:38,935
feels about me.

540
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:41,438
-Ah, you're curious about how they feel?
-Yes.

541
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:43,940
-Today, I asked whether…
-I see.

542
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:47,027
…there was anyone else
he wanted to go on a date with.

543
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:49,196
-I see.
-Could he fall for that person?

544
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,489
And how into her would he actually be?

545
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:53,575
Not sure if you noticed,

546
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:57,370
but we've gone on dates
for three days in a row now.

547
00:24:57,871 --> 00:24:59,789
Is there anybody else
you're interested in?

548
00:24:59,873 --> 00:25:01,499
[solemn music playing]

549
00:25:03,335 --> 00:25:04,502
Uh… [coughs]

550
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,171
[sniffles]

551
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:07,881
Oh, so that…

552
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:08,798
-Well…
-Mmm.

553
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:13,720
-No, no, no.
-No, no.

554
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:15,096
It's pretty… here.

555
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:19,392
[In-guk] She must still be curious
about Jae-yun's feelings.

556
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:23,563
[music fades]

557
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:24,689
[tarot reader] Mmm.

558
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:32,489
Uh, the cards are saying he's interested
in a new person right now.

559
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:34,449
There's something new here.

560
00:25:35,575 --> 00:25:40,038
However, it doesn't seem like
this interest has begun to grow.

561
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:41,581
-Mmm. I see.
-It's very new.

562
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:43,750
It's true that he's interested.

563
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:45,627
There is a possibility now.

564
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,796
Yes.

565
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,881
[solemn music playing]

566
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:53,218
Do you have any other questions?

567
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:54,886
-Any other questions?
-Hmm.

568
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:56,346
[Ji-yeon] Hmm…

569
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:58,056
[cards shuffling]

570
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:02,394
[music fades]

571
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:03,687
No, I don't.

572
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:05,689
Is that the only person…

573
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:08,692
-[Car] Ugh. Ji-yeon only has eyes for him.
-Yes.

574
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:12,862
Besides him, I'm honestly
not even curious about the others. Yes.

575
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:15,824
Or you could
find a completely new love too.

576
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:16,741
[Ji-yeon] Mmm.

577
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:18,702
-I feel…
-Yes?

578
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:20,370
Well…

579
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,335
Relax, relax.

580
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:30,088
[gentle melancholic music playing]

581
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:31,381
[Ji-yeon] Mmm.

582
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:32,966
[sniffling]

583
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:41,641
I can't do this.

584
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:43,184
-You can't?
-Yes.

585
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:44,477
-Hmm.
-I want to go.

586
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:45,395
Okay.

587
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:50,358
I just didn't really feel curious
about anything else,

588
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:51,693
so I left in the middle.

589
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:54,571
What I'm thinking now is,

590
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:55,655
"Well,

591
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:57,991
now what should I do here?"

592
00:26:58,074 --> 00:27:00,285
[chuckles softly] That's all I'm thinking.

593
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:04,873
-Oh, Ji-yeon. I'm so upset, seriously.
-[Eun-ji] Aw…

594
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:08,001
They're not… used to this,

595
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:09,878
so they can't help.

596
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:12,756
-They hurt others and get hurt.
-Mmm. You're right.

597
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:14,758
-And they feel bad.
-[Han-na] Mmm.

598
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,843
[music fades]

599
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:19,929
[whispers indistinctly]

600
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,432
[Jae-yun] Where's Ji-yeon? Where is she?

601
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:28,063
I thought I needed
to really talk to Ji-yeon

602
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:31,983
privately about what I thought and…

603
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:36,237
how I felt from before our one-on-one date

604
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:37,947
till now.

605
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:40,533
[Seung-li sighs]

606
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:42,827
Mmm.

607
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:43,953
[gentle music playing]

608
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:46,456
Jae-yun seemed to be kinda worried.

609
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:50,585
Earlier, he seemed very concerned.
He drank a lot too.

610
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:54,547
Well, I think he was saying
he wanted a chance to talk to you.

611
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:56,091
-Really?
-Yeah.

612
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:58,676
-But I don't know what he'll say.
-I just…

613
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:03,598
He wasn't talking to me all day,
so I asked him a few questions

614
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:04,974
when we were alone.

615
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:07,227
But he kept beating around the bush.

616
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:11,981
"Was today fun?" "Yes, it was."
His question to me was whether I had fun.

617
00:28:12,065 --> 00:28:14,901
It could be that he's bad
at expressing himself.

618
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:16,778
-I mean, I totally understand that.
-Yeah.

619
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:18,196
I totally get that.

620
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:20,865
[Seung-li exhales]

621
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:22,659
-[Jae-yun] Hey.
-Uh… Hey.

622
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:25,328
-[Jae-yun] Can we talk?
-[Seung-li] Sure, that's cool.

623
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:28,832
-[Ji-yeon] It's okay.
-[Seung-li] I'm gonna hang with Sang-ho.

624
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:34,337
[music fades]

625
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:36,464
-Did you want to talk?
-Huh?

626
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:37,465
I mean…

627
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:39,968
I just…

628
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:45,140
-I thought maybe I should…
-Mmm.

629
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:50,228
I think I should tell you
about what happened

630
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:53,356
from… the beginning.

631
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,941
-Okay.
-If that's okay.

632
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:57,193
-Just say what you want to say.
-Oh, okay.

633
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:58,153
So before,

634
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:02,198
I was sincerely under the impression

635
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:03,908
that you…

636
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,704
saw me only as a friend.

637
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:11,166
On our first one-on-one date,

638
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:12,500
I realized that…

639
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:16,713
you actually had romantic feelings for me.

640
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:19,424
-But I kind of liked somebody else.
-Mmm. I see.

641
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:26,139
After that, I think I tried keeping
a respectful distance from you.

642
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:27,432
Yeah, you're right.

643
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:30,435
I already knew
that you liked someone else.

644
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:32,771
-But I thought…
-Right, right.

645
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:35,899
"Why does he keep beating around the bush
instead of telling me?"

646
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:37,650
-You get me?
-Yeah.

647
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:41,738
-Was I doing that?
-Yeah.

648
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:43,281
Well, I…

649
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:46,576
think this… is why I did that.

650
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:49,788
I… I thought telling you
that I liked her would…

651
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:53,291
-would hurt you, so I think I…
-Right.

652
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,251
…was avoiding that.

653
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:57,003
Right, but that's even more hurtful.

654
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:58,338
-Oh.
-Yeah.

655
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:02,300
It's better to say those things
as soon as possible.

656
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:03,510
[inhales]

657
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:09,015
I think I'm…

658
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:13,937
-I'm just not used to this.
-Mmm.

659
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:17,857
[pensive music playing]

660
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:23,404
I don't really…

661
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:25,740
know the reason,

662
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:30,745
but like how some people have
unlimited… confidence,

663
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:31,704
I think…

664
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:35,542
I have… unlimited shame.

665
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:37,544
And yeah,

666
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:42,674
I kind of… feel careful
about expressing… my feelings,

667
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:46,302
so I think I've always
tried my best not to…

668
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:49,889
draw too much attention to myself and…

669
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:52,684
not show my feelings to others.

670
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:56,563
[music fades]

671
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:58,523
-[Jae-yun] I learned that here.
-Mmm.

672
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:01,025
I didn't have the courage, so…

673
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:04,821
even if being clear
would quickly solve things,

674
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:07,407
I always beat around the bush.

675
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,868
-I think that caused more…
-Mmm.

676
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:11,536
…misunderstandings.

677
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:13,663
-Yeah, right.
-And I think that

678
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:16,207
ended up hurting you even more.

679
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,420
So I felt bad about that, Ji-yeon.

680
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:22,589
-I'm sorry.
-Mmm.

681
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:26,551
It's okay.

682
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:29,053
I mean, I'm thankful that you told me.

683
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:30,263
[Jae-yun] Hmm.

684
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:32,348
[gentle solemn music playing]

685
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:38,021
[Ji-yeon] Things had become
awkward with Jae-yun,

686
00:31:38,104 --> 00:31:41,900
and I couldn't sort out
my thoughts about myself,

687
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:43,443
so I was having a hard time.

688
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:47,488
But after talking to Jae-yun, I actually…

689
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:49,449
felt better.

690
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,201
You can't, like…

691
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:54,913
With the person you know you like,
you don't…

692
00:31:57,999 --> 00:31:59,834
[chuckles] How do I say this?

693
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,753
You can't act like this to them.

694
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,631
-[Jae-yun] Mmm.
-Mmm.

695
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:09,135
Because she was so calm about it,

696
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:13,222
I felt bad and… embarrassed.

697
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:16,434
Whenever something
like this in my life happens,

698
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:21,314
I always chose to cowardly distance myself

699
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:22,565
instead of just…

700
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:24,359
rejecting someone.

701
00:32:25,026 --> 00:32:30,031
I felt bad and thankful
to Ji-yeon for being so understanding.

702
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:32,659
I think she helped me

703
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:36,079
get it together and grow a little.

704
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:39,207
[inhales]

705
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,292
-Wow, that's so…
-[Eun-ji] Yeah.

706
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:45,296
That was a whole storm of emotions.

707
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,547
-[Car] Yeah.
-Seriously.

708
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:47,715
-Mmm.
-[Han-na] Mmm.

709
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,260
Right. When we're dating in real life,

710
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:54,263
-we can't just avoid everything, right?
-Of course.

711
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:56,683
We need to talk honestly
about how we feel…

712
00:32:56,766 --> 00:32:58,601
-[In-guk] Yeah.
-…resolve misunderstandings.

713
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:04,440
I think Jae-yun has grown a lot
and learned from this opportunity.

714
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:07,110
Do people usually do this much
self-reflection on dating shows?

715
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:08,695
-[Han-na] Really.
-[Eun-ji] Seriously.

716
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:09,654
That's so impressive.

717
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:12,240
-This show feels like a show about growth.
-[Han-na] Yes!

718
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:14,325
-Yes, this show has that part to it.
-Exactly.

719
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:17,161
I was worried because
Jae-yun was blaming himself so much.

720
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:19,580
I'm glad that he got to talk to her.

721
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,040
It was a much-needed conversation.

722
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:24,210
Yeah, and also,
I'm sure it took a lot of courage.

723
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:25,211
You're right.

724
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:26,671
Yeah. For Jae-yun too.

725
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:28,256
Wasn't that the bravest thing

726
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:29,882
-we've seen Jae-yun do?
-[Han-na] Mmm.

727
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:31,592
-Yeah.
-[Han-na] You're right. Yes.

728
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:35,722
[Hyun-kyu] I want to do something
more for you, but I don't know.

729
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:39,267
Can you tell me what more I should do?

730
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:42,145
Tell you what you should do?

731
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:45,314
Like, is it okay for me
to keep going like this?

732
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:46,232
But I don't…

733
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:49,652
-want you to do anything unnatural.
-Mmm.

734
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:52,113
If I tell you,
"You need to live this way,"

735
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:54,907
can you live like that forever?
I mean, that sounds funny, but…

736
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:58,953
But I chose this job because
I decided to live like that forever.

737
00:33:59,037 --> 00:33:59,871
What?

738
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:02,081
I mean, not decided
to live like that forever.

739
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:04,709
It has just become
more comfortable for me.

740
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:06,753
Anyway, what am I even saying?

741
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:08,755
I feel like I always
go off topic. [chuckles]

742
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:10,339
What was I going to say?

743
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:14,552
I was talking about dating,
and you told me about your job.

744
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:17,555
You're kind of rambling today.

745
00:34:17,638 --> 00:34:19,098
I'm usually a good listener.

746
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:20,391
Yeah, you are. You are.

747
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:22,685
Today, I have something
I want to say first.

748
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:25,438
-I was thinking, "I should say this first"
-Oh, really? I'm sorry.

749
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:28,066
but you cut me off
and started talking first.

750
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:29,942
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I felt so…

751
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:31,652
So… I mean, after doing that,

752
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:34,405
I felt like
I was going crazy from anxiety.

753
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:37,575
-So, I…
-Oh, I'm sorry. I'll listen now.

754
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:39,327
Mmm. No, you go ahead.

755
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,162
I said everything I wanted to say.

756
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:42,371
-Really?
-Mmm.

757
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:46,000
I don't know. I…
Uh, I can't… see anything right now.

758
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:50,421
I feel like I'm slowly becoming a baby.
I'm regressing to a child.

759
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:51,839
I shouldn't be like this, though.

760
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:54,133
I know that,
but I can't keep my head straight.

761
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:57,261
I can't. I really can't control myself.
What should I do?

762
00:34:57,845 --> 00:34:59,931
He's telling her
all of his weaknesses right now,

763
00:35:00,014 --> 00:35:00,848
-isn't he?
-Exactly.

764
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,101
-Ji-su likes the reliable type.
-[Car] Yeah. Exactly.

765
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:06,062
Saying those things
could make… him seem less attractive.

766
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:07,146
[Car] It must be, yes.

767
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:09,816
-Right. He… he was too honest.
-[Han-na] Right.

768
00:35:09,899 --> 00:35:11,692
-The guys keep disappointing her.
-Exactly.

769
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,694
Seung-li had that drinking battle earlier.

770
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:16,114
-Uh-huh.
-What can Ji-su be thinking?

771
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:17,073
[Han-na] Exactly.

772
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:20,576
I mean, Hyun-kyu… Their conversation
felt good in the beginning.

773
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,995
Right, she said he was
the most comfortable to talk to.

774
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:24,580
But suddenly, something changed.

775
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:26,791
-He suddenly started whining.
-[In-guk] This…

776
00:35:26,874 --> 00:35:28,209
[laughter]

777
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:31,796
-[Car] You're on a dating show.
-That does decrease his attractiveness.

778
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:34,298
-You can't start whining.
-Oh, no. What will he do?

779
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:35,925
-[In-guk] This is so…
-[laughs]

780
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:37,552
-He's nervous.
-Yes. That must be why.

781
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:40,471
He couldn't control his heart.
He just couldn't help himself.

782
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:42,974
-He doesn't want to lose her.
-God help us.

783
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:44,392
-So, I…
-What?

784
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:45,643
I want to be your best,

785
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:47,520
-but if that doesn't happen…
-Yeah.

786
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:50,189
…there's nothing I can do.
I think I did my best.

787
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,275
What can I do…

788
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:55,570
Uh, you asked for confirmation,
so I tried to give you that.

789
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,321
[Car] Look at Ji-su's facial expression.

790
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:59,365
That's enough. I mean, what more can I do?

791
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:00,992
[amusing music playing]

792
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:02,243
-Right.
-Hmm.

793
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,120
Oh, I said I would listen,

794
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:06,914
-and I'm just talking by myself again.
-Yeah, I'm listening.

795
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:10,126
I'm normally a very good listener,

796
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:13,171
but today, I really blabbered on.

797
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:16,966
I couldn't hold back the words,
so I just let everything out.

798
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:20,428
So, I just…
I didn't have the capacity to think.

799
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:21,721
[music fades]

800
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:25,266
[Ji-su] I wasn't planning
to talk to Hyun-kyu for that long,

801
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,935
but I missed my chance to cut it off.

802
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,812
I said that my ideal type

803
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:34,901
was someone who could help control
my emotional fluctuations,

804
00:36:34,984 --> 00:36:38,696
but Hyun-kyu could not stay calm, so…

805
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:39,947
[quirky music playing]

806
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:40,990
Well… [sighs]

807
00:36:41,073 --> 00:36:42,450
I felt overwhelmed.

808
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:44,785
"Oh, this is too much."
That's what I thought.

809
00:36:45,953 --> 00:36:47,496
You're handling a lot, Ji-su.

810
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:50,625
Can I go hang out with Min-hong?

811
00:36:50,708 --> 00:36:52,501
[Car] She's looking
for a comfortable friend.

812
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:54,545
-You should get some rest too.
-Oh, Min-hong.

813
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:56,422
-Mmm.
-If it's Min-hong, I'll let you go.

814
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:57,506
[chuckles awkwardly]

815
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,383
I'll go see our Princess Thumbelina.

816
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:00,301
-Okay.
-Yeah.

817
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:03,638
What should I do? Sit outside?

818
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:04,764
-No, you--
-Or go inside?

819
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:06,766
Why are you asking that?

820
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:08,017
Do what you want.

821
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,060
[Han-na laughs]

822
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:11,270
-Go in? Should I?
-No, you should go in and rest.

823
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:13,272
[hesitates] Then when… What about you?

824
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:14,649
-I'll be here…
-Gonna go to bed?

825
00:37:14,732 --> 00:37:17,401
Yeah. Go inside and go to your place.
Go to your room.

826
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:19,946
What if people are lined up
when you get back to your room?

827
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:20,863
[chuckles]

828
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:23,616
-No. No, they're not that passionate.
-They won't be lined up?

829
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:24,784
[chuckles] Really?

830
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:27,453
-[Ji-su] Sleep well. Bye.
-See you.

831
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:29,747
[Hyun-kyu] See you tomorrow.

832
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:34,418
Wow, he's worried
other guys will go to Ji-su.

833
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:35,544
-Right.
-[Car] Exactly.

834
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:37,880
-[In-guk] He's worried.
-I can see why he feels that way.

835
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:40,716
-I do too. He could end up…
-[Han-na] So he couldn't let her go.

836
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,468
-[Eun-ji] Right.
-But it's a little too…

837
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:43,886
Can I be really honest?

838
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:45,346
If I were Ji-su, I'd think,

839
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:48,057
-"Wow. What is wrong with me?"
-[Cupids laughing]

840
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:50,268
"How could I be so unlucky? Seriously."

841
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:52,687
[laughing] Gosh. Why are you so funny?

842
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,522
Also, make the kids swim a bit.

843
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:56,983
Gosh. What a waste of water.

844
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:58,192
[Han-na laughs]

845
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:00,528
[Min-hong] You must be really tired.

846
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:02,280
[Ji-su] Yeah, I'm really tired. [sighs]

847
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:05,199
So we stood there
and talked for two hours.

848
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,951
He was rambling.

849
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:09,954
-Mmm.
-And he would cut me off and talk over me.

850
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:12,456
Because he felt so rushed.

851
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,917
I'm a bit drained.

852
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:16,377
Oh, really?

853
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,463
So, if he becomes my boyfriend,

854
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:21,048
I think I'd feel drained.

855
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,634
Like I'm taking care of a younger brother.

856
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:28,014
That's what I'm worried about.
If he becomes my boyfriend…

857
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:30,016
[inhales sharply] Could he handle me?

858
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:33,477
-Mm-hmm…
-This is also a funny thing to say,

859
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:37,523
but is there a guy
who can handle my ups and downs?

860
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:40,443
I want to find a guy like that.
Anyway, this is the thing.

861
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:42,320
Right now… [sighs]

862
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:45,906
I'm wondering, "Am I too picky?"

863
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,325
[scoffs]

864
00:38:47,408 --> 00:38:49,160
-Not… not at all.
-Really?

865
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:51,412
-I'm not?
-Not… Well, no.

866
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:54,415
It's normal to want a boyfriend

867
00:38:54,498 --> 00:38:56,917
-that fits your personal needs.
-Mmm. Mmm.

868
00:38:57,877 --> 00:39:00,421
To be honest,
you can't choose your parents,

869
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:02,715
and you can't choose your kids.

870
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:05,092
The universe decides all that.

871
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:08,888
-But you can choose your boyfriend.
-You're right.

872
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:10,639
-[In-guk] Preach, sister!
-[Eun-ji] Right!

873
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:13,100
You don't have to date everyone
who says they like you.

874
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:14,060
[In-guk] Of course.

875
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:17,021
-Ji-su isn't picky at all right now.
-[Car] Yeah, that's right.

876
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:19,565
She could be
much pickier if she wanted to.

877
00:39:19,648 --> 00:39:20,483
[Han-na] Mmm.

878
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:21,901
[Min-hong] What will you do

879
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:23,903
-if you can't even choose that?
-Mmm.

880
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:28,115
So we just have to choose
according to our own needs.

881
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:32,036
If he's not it, he's just not it.

882
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:34,205
That's… not a bad thing.

883
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:35,790
-Right?
-Yes.

884
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:40,336
I'm sure people who are dating
all have at least one requirement, right?

885
00:39:41,003 --> 00:39:43,923
-If not, I think they're too spineless.
-[laughs]

886
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:46,175
Then why are you dating that person?

887
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:48,427
Just for a dopamine hit? That's not it.

888
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:52,348
What I'm saying is, I don't want
you thinking you're being too picky.

889
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,768
This is my honest thought.

890
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:58,896
I don't want you
to cut the shape you want into a square

891
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:02,274
just because
you want to be in a relationship.

892
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,318
Thank you.

893
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:07,154
I'm sure there is someone
who will see your true value.

894
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:10,116
-[Ji-su] Mmm!
-No, I'm serious. Oh, gosh.

895
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:11,784
Oh, gosh.

896
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:15,496
-Min-hong must be good at giving advice.
-Seriously.

897
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:18,666
Min-hong is good at understanding
the point, and she gives good advice.

898
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,501
Why are they good
at everything but dating?

899
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:23,671
-[In-guk] Seriously.
-Other people's relationships are easy.

900
00:40:23,754 --> 00:40:24,588
Yeah.

901
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:25,798
-Ah…
-[Han-na] For sure.

902
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:30,553
[Ji-yeon] Jeez. Is Seung-li
talking to her? I'm so curious.

903
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:36,767
Wait, wait. Where…
where are Hyun-kyu and the other guys?

904
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:38,519
[Ji-yeon] What are they talking about?

905
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:41,272
[Seung-chan] Whoa.

906
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:42,982
They're sitting on the bench in front.

907
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:47,528
I think… Hyun-kyu is…

908
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:50,322
-[Seung-chan] What?
-…making things too hard.

909
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:52,366
-The other person--
-Talking to her is one thing,

910
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,869
but I felt so bad seeing him
waiting to talk to her.

911
00:40:54,952 --> 00:40:57,204
I mean, he… he knows that they're waiting.

912
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,498
[Ji-yeon] I think
he's not letting her go intentionally.

913
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:01,125
[Seung-chan] Oh, he's pretty ruthless.

914
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:02,209
I don't really like it.

915
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:05,254
I mean, shouldn't there be
some fair play or something?

916
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,256
[Min-hong] Hey, everybody.

917
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:09,133
[indistinct chatter]

918
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:12,261
I'll go in to think a bit.

919
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:14,680
-[Hyun-kyu] Okay.
-[Min-hong] I might do the same.

920
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:15,973
-I'll go.
-See you next time.

921
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:18,058
[Do] So much has happened.

922
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:20,936
-Just this whole day.
-[Jeong-mok] I know.

923
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:22,313
[Do] Yesterday…

924
00:41:22,396 --> 00:41:24,440
Was there an hour's worth
of things to talk about?

925
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:25,649
-[Hyun-kyu] What?
-Yeah.

926
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,194
-Was I there for an hour?
-[Seung-chan] Yeah.

927
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:31,614
Was it more? Maybe… it was two hours?

928
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:39,288
Why?

929
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:43,959
I mean, it's hard for me to say this.

930
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:48,255
I'm… I'm not good at
this whole being direct thing, but…

931
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:50,716
I'm saying this because I'm your roommate.

932
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:52,092
You, uh…

933
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:56,180
-During Eternal Singles' Night today…
-Yeah.

934
00:41:56,263 --> 00:41:58,057
[Seung-chan] …people were
really judging you

935
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:01,685
for talking to only one person.

936
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:06,190
-From what I saw…
-[Hyun-kyu] Right.

937
00:42:06,273 --> 00:42:10,486
For example, Seung-li was sleeping here,
wondering, "Oh, they must be done, right?"

938
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:14,615
I honestly don't think others saw it
as a good thing.

939
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:15,741
So…

940
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:16,784
[Hyun-kyu] Mmm.

941
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:20,162
[Seung-chan] I thought if…
we didn't tell you and kept it between us,

942
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:21,789
that'd be talking behind your back.

943
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:24,792
-I felt bad about that.
-He didn't wanna talk behind your back.

944
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:25,918
[Seung-chan] That's right.

945
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:27,753
[Sang-ho] Is it all right
that we told you?

946
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:31,507
So, the fact that I took her out
and… kept her for so long?

947
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:33,425
-So, like, we…
-[Sang-ho] Not that exactly.

948
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:35,302
…thought maybe it was a bit too much.

949
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,429
And at this rate,

950
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:39,765
-people could start avoiding you.
-[Sang-ho] Yeah.

951
00:42:39,848 --> 00:42:40,683
[Han-na] Mmm.

952
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:42,601
-Seung-chan is being careful.
-[Car] He is.

953
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:45,354
He's telling him as his roommate,
but after hearing that,

954
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:47,898
-people are judging him negatively…
-Right, right.

955
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:48,983
…Hyun-kyu is a bit…

956
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:50,109
-Yeah.
-Right.

957
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:51,443
Honestly, it's not good to say,

958
00:42:51,527 --> 00:42:53,737
-"This person thinks negatively of you."
-[Han-na] Ah.

959
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:55,698
It would've been good
to share his opinion.

960
00:42:55,781 --> 00:42:58,242
But saying, "People are
judging you negatively," is a bit…

961
00:42:58,325 --> 00:43:00,202
-Right. That's a bit…
-[Car] It's not helping.

962
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:03,205
-[Eun-ji] Right.
-So I was trying my best, but I guess…

963
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:05,749
it could seem that way.

964
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:07,710
I could be…

965
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:09,587
I could be wrong about this too.

966
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,922
-I haven't dated either.
-[Sang-ho] He has a point.

967
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:12,840
You need to try.

968
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:15,050
-You need to try in order to date.
-[Sang-ho] Right.

969
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:16,510
A lot of people say that.

970
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:19,346
-But be aware of how people are feeling.
-Yeah, right.

971
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:20,306
[Hyun-kyu] Mmm.

972
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:22,349
So, I want you to judge for yourself.

973
00:43:22,433 --> 00:43:24,852
If you still want to do that,

974
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:27,354
just know that I support you
as your roommate.

975
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:29,690
[Hyun-kyu] I was very offended.

976
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:33,444
I came here to date,
and I tried my best to do that. I…

977
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:36,447
I don't know why
they're saying that to me.

978
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:37,906
[tense music playing]

979
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:40,409
They must… think I broke some rule.

980
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:44,538
A lot of time had passed as we talked,
and I didn't notice.

981
00:43:44,622 --> 00:43:47,124
But then, they should've
come to me and told me.

982
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:49,335
They… they could've interrupted.

983
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:52,379
If they said
they also wanted to talk to her,

984
00:43:52,463 --> 00:43:54,548
and I… denied that,

985
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,467
I would totally understand

986
00:43:57,259 --> 00:43:59,678
the negativity
and the attitude they're giving me.

987
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:03,599
-[Sang-ho] You misinterpreted us.
-He should've told me. I prefer that.

988
00:44:03,682 --> 00:44:05,643
Exactly. I mean, in a way,

989
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:08,103
you could say we chose that.

990
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:11,148
If Seung-li had said that to me,

991
00:44:11,231 --> 00:44:15,069
I would've sincerely felt bad.
"I wasn't considerate." Like that.

992
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:17,404
-Yeah.
-I think that's my choice.

993
00:44:19,114 --> 00:44:20,866
I can't care about
other people's judgment.

994
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:22,576
-Catching two birds…
-I agree.

995
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,703
-You can't worry about people judging you.
-I just…

996
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:27,289
I want to ignore the people not involved.

997
00:44:27,956 --> 00:44:30,000
Then… I should go to Seung-li first.

998
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:31,877
I should… I should do that.

999
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,962
It wouldn't be a bad idea
to have a three-way talk.

1000
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:36,465
-The three of us should get together?
-Do exactly that.

1001
00:44:36,548 --> 00:44:40,177
-Just put it all out there.
-[Hyun-kyu] My almost three-hour-long…

1002
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:43,013
-[Seung-li] Oh, about that?
-…conversation with one person…

1003
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:44,932
-[Seung-li] Yeah.
-…offended some people.

1004
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:47,810
-That's what I roughly heard.
-[Seung-li] Who said that?

1005
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:50,521
[Sang-ho] So, Seung-chan explained…
summarized it for him, like…

1006
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:51,855
[Seung-li] Oh, I got it.

1007
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:54,900
I see what you're saying.
You just… have to do what you want.

1008
00:44:54,983 --> 00:44:56,693
-Okay?
-[Hyun-kyu] I'm sorry, Seung-li.

1009
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:59,321
-[Seung-li] Why?
-[Hyun-kyu] I'm not sorry about competing.

1010
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:01,698
-[Sang-ho] But do you--
-[Hyun-kyu] But this situation…

1011
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:04,284
-I feel… well… I don't know.
-[Seung-li] Oh, well, don't…

1012
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:06,829
Don't listen to that gossip.

1013
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:07,746
I mean…

1014
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:10,165
Don't worry too much about that.

1015
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:11,542
[Hyun-kyu] Okay. Thanks.

1016
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:16,338
Oh, I don't know
if it had to get this big.

1017
00:45:16,422 --> 00:45:18,006
Hyun-kyu is right in a way,

1018
00:45:18,090 --> 00:45:20,175
because if someone wanted
to talk to Ji-su…

1019
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:21,093
[In-guk] Right.

1020
00:45:21,176 --> 00:45:23,679
…they could've said,
"When will you be done?"

1021
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:25,389
or "Let me know when you're done."

1022
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:27,224
-"I wanna talk to you too."
-[Han-na] True.

1023
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:29,351
If so, Hyun-kyu could've thought,

1024
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:32,688
"Oh, someone is waiting,"
and wrapped it up at an appropriate time.

1025
00:45:32,771 --> 00:45:35,774
-Mmm.
-And the thing is, Hyun-kyu and Ji-su…

1026
00:45:35,858 --> 00:45:37,234
-both wanted to talk.
-Correct.

1027
00:45:37,317 --> 00:45:38,569
It wasn't just

1028
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:41,572
-Hyun-kyu not letting Ji-su go.
-[Car and Eun-ji] Mmm.

1029
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:43,407
-Mmm.
-[Han-na] I think that started

1030
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:46,743
the misunderstanding
of Hyun-kyu keeping Ji-su there.

1031
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:47,911
-Mmm.
-[Eun-ji] Mmm.

1032
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:49,329
PARK JI-YEON
YI DO

1033
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:51,331
[Do] I don't know if you know,

1034
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:54,251
but I started to like Jeong-mok more.

1035
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:56,712
Jeong-mok? I mean, more than Seung-li?

1036
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:58,213
I want to get to know him.

1037
00:45:58,297 --> 00:46:01,550
I mean, I'm not totally into him yet
or anything like that.

1038
00:46:01,633 --> 00:46:06,221
So, if I get a chance
to go on a date with Jeong-mok,

1039
00:46:06,763 --> 00:46:09,516
I want to do my best
to show him my good side.

1040
00:46:10,058 --> 00:46:12,519
I want to eat Buldak noodles,
but I'm holding back.

1041
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,314
-Hmm. Aw…
-I don't want to look puffy.

1042
00:46:15,397 --> 00:46:17,900
-I think I'm trying pretty hard.
-You are.

1043
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:22,070
Right now, I'm so jealous of the people

1044
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:24,364
who have someone
that they're interested in.

1045
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:26,074
[Do] Mmm.

1046
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:28,160
-I get that.
-Seriously.

1047
00:46:28,243 --> 00:46:31,121
Jeong-mok and Seung-li are just friends.

1048
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:33,290
I'm even helping Seung-li.

1049
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:35,292
Jeong-mok knows who I'm interested in.

1050
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:38,295
We are not into each other.
He's just a friend.

1051
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:39,796
A funny friend.

1052
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:43,217
[In-guk] Wow. Day 4
s such an intense rollercoaster ride.

1053
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:44,259
-Wow.
-[Eun-ji] Right?

1054
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:47,930
[Car] Okay, it's Day 5.

1055
00:46:48,013 --> 00:46:50,432
[mellow music playing]

1056
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:53,352
-[Ji-su] I'm going to talk to Sang-ho.
-[Seung-li] Okay.

1057
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:54,811
-[Ji-su] Yeah.
-[Sang-ho] Hey.

1058
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:56,855
What? Ji-su's going to talk to Sang-ho?

1059
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:59,983
Did she miss Sang-ho
after having a bit of a hard time?

1060
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:00,943
[music fades]

1061
00:47:01,026 --> 00:47:04,321
In a way, I'm talking to
three people right now, right?

1062
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:05,239
That's right.

1063
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:07,866
But taking your time, I mean, here,

1064
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:09,117
-I'm taking your chances.
-Ah.

1065
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:10,994
I mean, you can't think of it like that.

1066
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:15,249
No, so I thought I should
sort out my feelings soon.

1067
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:18,168
I thought I should…

1068
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:20,879
-that I should focus a bit.
-Mmm.

1069
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:24,591
I haven't decided on who to choose

1070
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:27,803
-if I get to, uh, choose my date today.
-Ah.

1071
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:31,390
But I think
I'll probably go with someone else.

1072
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:35,143
I thought you should know how I feel

1073
00:47:35,227 --> 00:47:37,104
-in case, uh…
-Mmm.

1074
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:40,232
-…you get to choose your date.
-Mmm.

1075
00:47:40,315 --> 00:47:41,692
If you choose me,

1076
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:44,152
without knowing how I feel,

1077
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:46,947
-you'd be wasting an opportunity on me.
-Mmm.

1078
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:50,242
[Han-na] She's really
ending things neatly.

1079
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:53,161
-She means, "Don't pick me."
-Right. Telling him not to choose her?

1080
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:54,162
[Car] That's true.

1081
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:56,790
-Right. "I told you."
-[Car] That's what she's saying.

1082
00:47:56,873 --> 00:47:58,792
-I'm so sorry.
-Why do you feel bad?

1083
00:47:58,875 --> 00:48:01,628
I told you that I liked you first,
and now…

1084
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:02,963
I mean, it's normal

1085
00:48:03,046 --> 00:48:05,048
-for feelings to change, of course.
-Mmm.

1086
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:09,177
-Oh, a message. Wonder what's next.
-[cell phone chimes]

1087
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:10,804
TODAY'S DATING NEWSLETTER IS HERE

1088
00:48:10,887 --> 00:48:13,223
-[pleasant music playing]
-Hey, Ji-yeon.

1089
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:14,433
Let's go in.

1090
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:16,476
Let's read it.

1091
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,394
Oh!

1092
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:19,438
-[Ji-yeon] "Secret date."
-[Do] Whoa!

1093
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:21,982
[Ji-yeon] "You may go on a date
with whoever you'd like."

1094
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:23,900
"Everyone besides the two on the date…"

1095
00:48:23,984 --> 00:48:26,320
-They go on a date with who they like.
-[Car] So that's it!

1096
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:27,821
[Do] If it's with anyone we'd like.

1097
00:48:27,904 --> 00:48:29,906
-[Yeo-myung] I think so.
-[Min-hong] A secret date?

1098
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:31,742
Then, who should I pick today?

1099
00:48:32,534 --> 00:48:34,578
Ugh. Who should I pick?

1100
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:36,747
[groans]

1101
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:42,377
-[Seung-li] Secret date.
-Secret date. Right.

1102
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:44,546
[Seung-li] It's a secret one-on-one date…

1103
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,089
-Mmm.
-…but you can choose

1104
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:47,924
whoever you want.

1105
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:48,967
[music fades]

1107

SELECT YOUR DESIRED DATE

1108
00:48:53,555 --> 00:48:56,058
HOWEVER, YOU CAN SELECT ONLY ONE PERSON

1109
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:01,480
[Yeo-myung] Yesterday,

1110
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:06,276
I was totally rejected
by the person I was interested in.

1111
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:09,655
So, I wasn't sure
if I should pick someone else.

1112
00:49:10,238 --> 00:49:12,491
-[In-guk] Same for Ji-yeon.
-[Han-na] Jeez.

1113
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:15,494
Seriously. Should you
or should you not follow your heart,

1114
00:49:15,577 --> 00:49:18,121
knowing that person
isn't interested in you?

1115
00:49:18,205 --> 00:49:21,750
[Ji-su] I think Hyun-kyu
and Seung-li are similar.

1116
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:23,251
I can't decide.

1117
00:49:25,337 --> 00:49:26,421
Your name…

1118
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:32,135
[Seung-li sighs]

1119
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:34,346
[Han-na] Oh, Sang-ho
doesn't know who to pick.

1120
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:43,647
[object rattles]

1121
00:49:46,692 --> 00:49:49,111
Well, there… could be
another very one-sided result.

1122
00:49:49,194 --> 00:49:50,570
-[Han-na] Mmm.
-[Eun-ji] Oh…

1123
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:53,073
-Since maybe people overlap.
-[Eun-ji] Oh, that's so true.

1124
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:54,908
[Han-na] I'm worried it won't be even.

1125
00:49:54,991 --> 00:49:57,369
[In-guk] These secret dates
are chosen by the guys.

1126
00:49:57,452 --> 00:49:58,286
[Eun-ji] Oh.

1127
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:01,164
THE MEN CAN GO ON A DATE
WITH ONE PARTNER OF THEIR CHOOSING

1128
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:05,460
[Han-na] If they're not chosen by anyone,
they won't have a date.

1129
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:07,504
[Yeo-myung] It must be sad

1130
00:50:08,004 --> 00:50:09,089
if nobody comes.

1131
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:12,134
[Mi-ji] I wonder if someone chose me.

1132
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:15,303
[Do] At least one person
will choose me, right?

1133
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:19,433
[Min-hong] While waiting,
I was constantly thinking,

1134
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:21,727
"I wish my date would appear soon."

-[In-guk] Whoa. Hey.
-[Han-na] Wow!

1137
00:50:24,896 --> 00:50:26,648
Wow. Why do you look so cool?

1138
00:50:27,315 --> 00:50:28,567
[Han-na] Wow.

1142
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:36,908
Is that yummy?

1143
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:38,744
Is it yummy?

1144
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:40,245
Is the kitty happy?

1145
00:50:40,954 --> 00:50:42,414
Is it tasty?

1146
00:50:43,081 --> 00:50:44,082
Eat up, please.

1147
00:50:44,750 --> 00:50:46,084
Ow! That hurts.

1148
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:50,130
[In-guk] Who will it be?

1149
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:52,674
[Yeo-myung] I was expecting someone,

1150
00:50:52,758 --> 00:50:54,259
but I wasn't sure.

1151
00:50:54,342 --> 00:50:56,553
-It's gotta be Jae-yun. Yeah.
-[Han-na] Jae-yun, right?

1152
00:50:59,806 --> 00:51:01,641
-[In-guk] Jae-yun!
-[Eun-ji] Oh, it's Jae-yun.

Oh.

1155

-When… did you get here?
-It's finally their first one-on-one.

1156
00:51:13,653 --> 00:51:16,072
Jae-yun and Yeo-myung's
first one-on-one date.

1157
00:51:16,782 --> 00:51:18,366
[Yeo-myung] Honestly,

1158
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:22,579
I did get the feeling
that Jae-yun was interested in me.

1159
00:51:22,662 --> 00:51:24,748
-[In-guk] This could be his chance.
-[Han-na] Right.

1160

-Hey!
-Oh, hi.

Do you like cats?

Yes, I do.

-will lead the conversation a bit.
-[In-guk] Mm-hmm.

-[Eun-ji] Cute.

1177
00:52:09,334 --> 00:52:10,210
[Han-na] Really cute.

1178
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:12,754
-[In-guk] Nice. Opening his notebook.
-You really wrote a lot.

1179
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:14,214
What… what did you write?

1180
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:15,715
-Like, my thoughts…
-Mmm.

1181
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:17,717
-…and stuff.
-Ohh, kinda like a journal?

1182
00:52:18,552 --> 00:52:19,469
Mmm, yeah, kind of.

1183
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:20,554
Oh.

1184
00:52:21,179 --> 00:52:23,181
[In-guk] He's more nervous
because he likes her.

1185
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:25,392
[Han-na exhales sharply]
What will he ask her?

1186
00:52:26,184 --> 00:52:27,686
-[Jae-yun] Mmm.
-[Yeo-myung chuckles]

1187
00:52:27,769 --> 00:52:29,729
Just some everyday things?

1188
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:31,857
-Ah.
-Do you have any hobbies?

1189
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:34,609
Oh, my hobbies. Mmm.

1190
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:36,278
Did I not tell you that before?

1191
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,655
[charming whimsical music playing]

1192
00:52:38,738 --> 00:52:40,782
-Well… [stutters] swimming and…
-Yeah.

1193
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:42,993
-…working out…
-Oh.

1194
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:45,579
And running.

1195
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:46,705
No, I don't run.

1196
00:52:47,455 --> 00:52:48,582
I play futsal.

1197
00:52:48,665 --> 00:52:50,166
-Right. I was kind of…
-I play futsal.

1198
00:52:50,250 --> 00:52:52,335
…drunk then, yeah, futsal.

1199
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:54,754
[quirky music playing]

1200
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:01,094
-Let me see what I wrote down… Yeah.
-You have to look at that again?

1201
00:53:01,177 --> 00:53:02,012
[Yeo-myung chuckles]

1202
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:05,640
[Han-na] Oh, his hands are really shaking.

1203
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:06,766
[Han-na gasps]

1204
00:53:08,393 --> 00:53:09,519
[music fades]

1205
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:10,687
-[Jae-yun] Oh, well…
-Huh?

1206
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:15,191
What would you say
was your first impression of me?

1207
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:18,737
Oh, I thought you were handsome.

1208
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:20,822
-Mmm. Really?
-[both chuckle]

1209
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:21,740
Thanks.

1210
00:53:22,657 --> 00:53:23,867
[chuckles softly]

1211
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:25,744
-So, until now…
-Yeah?

1212
00:53:27,203 --> 00:53:30,916
…I feel like
I haven't fully expressed how I felt.

1213
00:53:30,999 --> 00:53:32,542
-Oh…
-So…

1214
00:53:33,251 --> 00:53:34,210
I've been…

1215
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:37,213
interested in you for a while.

1216
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:38,423
Oh.

1217
00:53:38,506 --> 00:53:39,341
In me?

1218
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:41,426
Yeah.

1219
00:53:41,509 --> 00:53:43,553
-Mmm.
-[mellow music playing]

1220
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:44,638
You had no idea?

1221
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:46,765
Oh, kind of?

1222
00:53:46,848 --> 00:53:49,434
Like, I was not really sure.

1223
00:53:49,517 --> 00:53:50,352
Ah.

1224
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:54,272
[Jae-yun] Hmm.

1225
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:55,315
I… I am.

1226
00:53:56,816 --> 00:54:00,028
-Oh.
-But even if it wasn't an actual date,

1227
00:54:00,111 --> 00:54:03,531
I could've asked you
to go out just to talk.

1228
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:04,616
I should've.

1229
00:54:04,699 --> 00:54:05,909
Mmm.

1230
00:54:05,992 --> 00:54:08,495
But I didn't because I… I was so nervous.

1231
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:10,372
-I don't know…
-Ah. I see. Oh.

1232
00:54:10,455 --> 00:54:12,248
Caring about what the others thought.

1233
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:13,667
What they thought?

1234
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,085
-Yeah.
-Oh, right.

1235
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,549
Ji-yeon told me something.

1236
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:22,634
Oh, what was that?

1237
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:26,846
-She said she had always cared about…
-Hmm.

1238
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:29,432
-…others instead of herself too.
-Mmm.

1239
00:54:30,308 --> 00:54:33,061
-That we should think about what we want…
-Ah.

1240
00:54:33,144 --> 00:54:35,397
-…and not what others think.
-Mmm.

1241
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:37,607
I plan…

1242
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:42,278
to try… to try to…

1243
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:44,239
-Mmm.
-…and change a lot going forward.

1244
00:54:46,324 --> 00:54:47,283
[music fades]

1245
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:49,661
RANDOM SPOT DATE

1246
00:54:49,744 --> 00:54:51,454
[mellow music playing]

1247
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:54,582
So, are you interested in anyone here?

1248
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:55,959
Yes, I am.

1249
00:54:56,876 --> 00:54:58,294
Can you tell me who that is?

1250
00:54:59,587 --> 00:55:00,588
Is it a secret?

1251
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:04,009
That's a little…

1252
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:06,011
difficult… [sniffles]

1253
00:55:06,928 --> 00:55:08,388
-to say.
-Mmm.

1254
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:10,390
-Okay.
-That…

1255
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:12,600
Yeah.

1256
00:55:15,687 --> 00:55:16,771
So, honestly… I mean,

1257
00:55:16,855 --> 00:55:19,691
I don't know how honest I should be,
'cause I don't want you to feel…

1258
00:55:19,774 --> 00:55:21,359
-Oh… Oh.
-…too much pressure.

1259
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:25,739
I'm not asking you
to give me an answer right… right away.

1260
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:31,286
So, I like you…

1261
00:55:32,537 --> 00:55:33,913
too… too much.

1262
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:35,040
I like you a lot.

1263
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:36,833
Me?

1264
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:38,251
-Yeah.
-I see.

1265
00:55:38,334 --> 00:55:39,627
[enthralling music playing]

1266
00:55:39,711 --> 00:55:41,046
[Jae-yun] So, to be honest,

1267
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:45,550
the happiest I've been here was actually…

1268
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:47,677
our spot date.

1269
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:49,387
Oh, my. Oh, my. Jae-yun, you…

1270
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:51,556
-Wow, he's really changed.
-[Eun-ji sighs]

1271
00:55:51,639 --> 00:55:52,599
He's a man.

1272
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:53,558
[Han-na gasps]

1273
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:54,642
I mean, it's so romantic.

1274
00:55:54,726 --> 00:55:58,021
He said, out of the four days,
he loved those 15 minutes the most.

1275
00:55:58,104 --> 00:55:59,647
Yes, he said he was the happiest then.

1276
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:02,484
Oh, the…

1277
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:03,943
the one with me?

1278
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:05,528
Yeah, that one. Yeah.

1279
00:56:06,821 --> 00:56:07,739
Back in the tent.

1280
00:56:07,822 --> 00:56:08,782
Ah.

1281
00:56:10,408 --> 00:56:12,702
-[Car] He is especially cool today.
-[chuckles]

1282
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:15,497
-[Eun-ji gasps] Yeo-myung looks happy!
-[Han-na] Yeo-myung is happy!

1283
00:56:15,997 --> 00:56:18,875
Jae-yun never went on a date with me.

1284
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:21,044
Just the ten-minute spot date.

1285
00:56:21,669 --> 00:56:25,006
Besides that, I don't really know Jae-yun,

1286
00:56:25,673 --> 00:56:27,300
so I wasn't interested.

1287
00:56:27,383 --> 00:56:30,970
But when I saw him
slowly confessing his feelings for me…

1288
00:56:32,931 --> 00:56:34,516
I thought to myself…

1289
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:38,770
"You know, he is actually pretty nice."

1290
00:56:41,523 --> 00:56:42,440
[music fades]

1291
00:56:42,524 --> 00:56:43,399
But, so…

1292
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,819
there is… someone…

1293
00:56:46,861 --> 00:56:47,821
um…

1294
00:56:48,404 --> 00:56:51,116
I'm interested in… currently.

1295
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:52,158
Mmm.

1296
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:57,872
Of course, my feelings could change
during the remaining days,

1297
00:56:57,956 --> 00:56:59,457
but… I…

1298
00:57:00,166 --> 00:57:02,210
can't give you an answer yet.

1299
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:03,586
Oh.

1300
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:05,713
-But I'm actually totally okay with that.
-Yeah?

1301
00:57:06,422 --> 00:57:08,091
So, I don't want an answer right away.

1302
00:57:08,716 --> 00:57:10,885
I just… How do… How do I put it?

1303
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:12,387
[enchanting music playing]

1304
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:15,098
-Until now…
-[softly] Mmm.

1305
00:57:15,181 --> 00:57:17,016
…regardless of the outcome,

1306
00:57:17,684 --> 00:57:19,978
-I never regretted it when I…
-[softly] Mmm.

1307
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:22,522
…was fully honest.

1308
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:24,691
So, that's enough for me.

1309
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:27,235
Yeah. So, in regards to that,

1310
00:57:28,236 --> 00:57:30,697
you don't need to feel bad at all

1311
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:34,409
about not being able
to give an answer right now.

1312
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:39,247
If you're okay with that, so am I.

1313
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:40,457
[chuckles]

1314
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:42,709
[ice rattles]

1315
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:46,963
I see. [chuckles]

1316
00:57:48,214 --> 00:57:49,132
[cell phone chimes]

1317
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:50,425
A MESSAGE HAS ARRIVED

1318
00:57:50,508 --> 00:57:51,843
Oh, what is this?

1319
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:56,681
-Wait. Why is their date so short? What?
-I'm supposed to leave first.

1320
00:57:56,764 --> 00:57:58,808
-Is it over? Oh.
-Huh? Yeah, I think so.

1321
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:00,310
-Gotta go. Yeah.
-See you.

1322
00:58:00,393 --> 00:58:02,228
-See you back there. Bye.
-Oh, yeah. See ya.

1323
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:05,648
[Eun-ji] But that was so nice,
Jae-yun. Good job.

1324
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:06,691
[In-guk] Seriously.

1325
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:08,735
-It was kind of like a movie.
-[Car] Mmm.

1326
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:10,737
Jae-yun's words
were like lines from a movie.

1327
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:14,115
See, the thing that people
love the most in the movies…

1328
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:15,742
-Mmm.
-…is when a guy…

1329
00:58:15,825 --> 00:58:17,118
-[Han-na] Mm-hmm.
-…like Jae-yun,

1330
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:20,371
who used to be awkward
in front of people and didn't know…

1331
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:23,082
-[Han-na] That's true.
-…what to do in front of his crush…

1332
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:25,335
But when he starts
to share his honest feelings,

1333
00:58:25,418 --> 00:58:26,586
he starts to speak so well.

1334
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:28,546
-[Eun-ji] Words were flowing out.
-Flowing out.

1335
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:31,799
-I thought he practiced it.
-I also really thought this was cool.

1336
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:33,218
"I acknowledge

1337
00:58:33,301 --> 00:58:35,011
-and respect your feelings."
-That's right.

1338
00:58:35,094 --> 00:58:37,764
-"I just wanted to express how I felt."
-[Eun-ji] Mmm.

1339
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:40,141
Saying, "I'm not asking for an answer,"

1340
00:58:40,225 --> 00:58:41,726
-was so mature…
-[Han-na] It was cool.

1341
00:58:41,809 --> 00:58:43,144
-It really was.
-…and so cool.

1342
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:45,522
I mean, did Jae-yun go
on a solo pilgrimage or something?

1343
00:58:45,605 --> 00:58:46,940
-He's been somewhere.
-He has.

1344
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:48,483
-A pilgrimage.
-[Car] Yeah.

1345
00:58:48,566 --> 00:58:49,609
He changed so much.

1346
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:51,277
-Our Jae-yun has changed.
-[Han-na] Aw.

1347
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:55,532
[solemn guitar music playing]

1348
00:58:58,284 --> 00:59:01,120
[Han-na] Gosh. I hope someone…
[inhales sharply]

1349
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:02,372
picked Ji-yeon.

1350
00:59:02,455 --> 00:59:03,498
[cell phone chimes]

1351
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:06,042
YOUR DATE HAS ENDED

1352
00:59:06,125 --> 00:59:07,794
[Car sighing] Ji-yeon… Oh…

1353
00:59:12,924 --> 00:59:13,758
[Ji-yeon] Well…

1354
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:17,595
I didn't really have anyone
I wanted to see,

1355
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:19,681
so I just wanted to leave soon.

1356
00:59:20,598 --> 00:59:21,599
[music fades]

1357
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:26,563
[Eun-ji] It's Ji-su.

1358
00:59:27,522 --> 00:59:29,232
[Han-na] Who will come first?

1359
00:59:29,315 --> 00:59:31,776
[Eun-ji] Oh, that walk is kind of…
[inhales sharply]

1360
00:59:31,859 --> 00:59:33,820
[curious music playing]

1361
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:34,737
Sang-ho?

1362
00:59:34,821 --> 00:59:36,739
I… think it's Hyun-kyu.

1363
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:37,782
Wait. Seung-li?

1364
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:40,952
[upbeat music playing]

1365
00:59:41,035 --> 00:59:42,161
[chuckles]

1366
00:59:43,037 --> 00:59:43,871
Hi.

1367
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:47,125
-[Han-na] Oh, it's Hyun-kyu.
-I'm here.

1368
00:59:47,208 --> 00:59:48,835
SECRET DATE
JI-SU & HYUN-KYU

1369
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:51,379
[In-guk] I hope Hyun-kyu
can be more calm today.

1370
00:59:51,462 --> 00:59:53,256
It's hot, so I brought this…

1371
00:59:53,339 --> 00:59:55,133
-Mmm?
-…for you to cover up with.

1372
00:59:55,216 --> 00:59:56,718
-Wasn't necessary, though.
-It's okay.

1373
00:59:56,801 --> 00:59:57,677
[both chuckle]

1374
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,262
The weather is so nice today.

1375
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:01,347
It's totally your vibe.

1376
01:00:02,181 --> 01:00:03,600
-Quiet…
-Mmm.

1377
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:04,601
…comfortable,

1378
01:00:05,226 --> 01:00:06,394
nice for a chat.

1379
01:00:09,564 --> 01:00:12,650
I actually have a lot of things
I want to do right now,

1380
01:00:12,734 --> 01:00:15,695
but I know you need time to think, so I…

1381
01:00:16,988 --> 01:00:18,448
I'm treading carefully.

1382
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:24,454
I think I should give you time
to be alone first.

1383
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:27,624
-So, I'm going to…
-Mmm.

1384
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:29,334
-…hold back and wait.
-Mmm.

1385
01:00:29,417 --> 01:00:34,255
I didn't come here, you know,
planning to just date anyone.

1386
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:37,216
-I'd… rather just not date anyone then.
-Hmm.

1387
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:43,473
Realistically, you must think I seem

1388
01:00:43,556 --> 01:00:45,558
a little unstable in this competition.

1389
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:46,851
[Hyun-kyu] Mmm.

1390
01:00:46,934 --> 01:00:49,228
But I'm actually unstable
in real life too.

1391
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:51,022
-Mmm.
-I actually…

1392
01:00:51,105 --> 01:00:52,857
I go… to therapy.

1393
01:00:54,525 --> 01:00:56,527
[somber music playing]

1394
01:00:58,112 --> 01:01:01,532
It sounds too dramatic
to call him a stalker,

1395
01:01:01,616 --> 01:01:03,743
but I had an experience that was similar

1396
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:06,913
to the awful experience
of having a stalker.

1397
01:01:07,622 --> 01:01:10,249
I was misunderstood a few times as well.

1398
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:14,879
That's what makes me
be extra careful and stuff.

1399
01:01:14,962 --> 01:01:16,673
[inhales sharply] But in a way,

1400
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:21,636
I'm drawing a line between me
and others, so… [inhales sharply]

1401
01:01:22,804 --> 01:01:26,391
When I got psychological tests,
and therapy,

1402
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:28,935
I learned I shouldn't do that,

1403
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:31,062
but it's not easy.

1404
01:01:31,145 --> 01:01:34,774
[Han-na sighs] Ji-su also had
some painful experiences.

1405
01:01:36,442 --> 01:01:38,569
The reason I can't easily date

1406
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:42,281
is because if I do,
my emotions will be unstable again,

1407
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:44,992
both positively and negatively.

1408
01:01:45,076 --> 01:01:48,705
-Right.
-So, I want that kind of reliability.

1409
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:51,541
Someone who can help me when…

1410
01:01:51,624 --> 01:01:53,376
-Hmm.
-…I'm feeling unstable.

1411
01:01:53,459 --> 01:01:54,335
[Hyun-kyu] Hmm.

1412
01:01:55,795 --> 01:01:58,631
The people who are interested in me now

1413
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:01,884
are interested
because of my appearance, right?

1414
01:02:02,802 --> 01:02:06,556
I always… thought that they'd approach me

1415
01:02:06,639 --> 01:02:08,558
because of my appearance…

1416
01:02:08,641 --> 01:02:09,892
[gentle solemn music playing]

1417
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:12,645
then leave because
my personality is too different.

1418
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:16,232
But I just said, "I have this weakness,
but I'm just human."

1419
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:19,152
"I'm not hiding anymore.
This is all of me."

1420
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:21,446
That's how I talked to him.

1421
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:25,324
Unlike the last date,

1422
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:29,287
Ji-su talked about
very private things to Hyun-kyu.

1423
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:30,204
-[In-guk] Mmm.
-Mmm.

1424
01:02:30,288 --> 01:02:32,415
I personally think being that honest

1425
01:02:32,498 --> 01:02:34,709
-about your weakness is truly impressive.
-[Han-na] Mmm.

1426
01:02:34,792 --> 01:02:36,210
-Totally.
-[Han-na] Agreed.

1427
01:02:36,294 --> 01:02:38,296
[gentle solemn music continues]

1428
01:02:40,965 --> 01:02:43,468
And there were parts I didn't know.

1429
01:02:43,551 --> 01:02:45,178
And now that I can piece

1430
01:02:46,137 --> 01:02:48,181
those things together with what I know,

1431
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:50,183
I can understand a lot.

1432
01:02:52,226 --> 01:02:53,519
Thank you for telling me.

1433
01:02:55,938 --> 01:03:00,526
I thought she must've told me
because she trusted me somewhat.

1434
01:03:01,486 --> 01:03:04,655
She also thought about a future with me,

1435
01:03:05,907 --> 01:03:07,283
so I was happy.

1436
01:03:07,825 --> 01:03:09,410
So, I spent some time thinking,

1437
01:03:10,077 --> 01:03:12,330
"How could I support her
with those things?"

1438
01:03:13,164 --> 01:03:15,917
"Am I someone… who can do that?"

1439
01:03:16,834 --> 01:03:17,668
[music fades]

1440
01:03:17,752 --> 01:03:20,296
I'm also sensitive and really caring,

1441
01:03:20,880 --> 01:03:22,799
so I can understand what you need

1442
01:03:22,882 --> 01:03:25,885
and I can be there for you
when you're down.

1443
01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:27,720
I… I can be there for you.

1444
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:29,472
[mellow music playing]

1445
01:03:29,555 --> 01:03:32,767
-I'd really like to be that person.
-Really?

1446
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:33,893
Oh…

1447
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:37,021
So, if you're worried about that…

1448
01:03:39,232 --> 01:03:40,066
Yeah.

1449
01:03:41,108 --> 01:03:42,693
-[chuckles]
-I'll give it my best shot.

1450
01:03:42,777 --> 01:03:45,321
-Your best shot?
-Yeah, if you give me that chance, I will.

1451
01:03:45,404 --> 01:03:46,614
-Mmm.
-[Hyun-kyu chuckles]

1452
01:03:49,408 --> 01:03:52,370
The more I talked to her,
the more interested I became.

1453
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:55,414
I think… I think she's the one.

1454
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:56,541
-[Car] Yes.
-[Han-na] Nice.

1455
01:03:56,624 --> 01:03:59,335
-I think that was basically a confession.
-[Han-na] Nice.

1456
01:03:59,418 --> 01:04:01,712
-"If you give me that chance, I will."
-[Han-na] Aw…

1457
01:04:01,796 --> 01:04:04,173
-Okay. If so, don't stop. Yeah.
-[Han-na] That's good.

1458
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:05,216
[music fades]

1459
01:04:13,808 --> 01:04:15,726
-[Han-na] It's Seung-li.
-[Car] The man on fire.

1460
01:04:15,810 --> 01:04:16,978
SECRET DATE
JI-SU & SEUNG-LI

1461
01:04:17,061 --> 01:04:19,021
-Hello.
-[Seung-li] Hello.

1462
01:04:19,105 --> 01:04:21,065
[upbeat music playing]

1463
01:04:21,607 --> 01:04:23,067
-Hey.
-[Ji-su chuckles]

1464
01:04:23,150 --> 01:04:25,069
-Did you know it was me?
-You?

1465
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:28,531
-I had a feeling you'd come.
-Really?

1466
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:31,117
You expected it. [exhales]

1467
01:04:32,368 --> 01:04:33,411
When did you get here?

1468
01:04:33,494 --> 01:04:34,829
-Just now.
-Just now?

1469
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:38,040
You weren't waiting too long, right?

1470
01:04:38,124 --> 01:04:38,958
Mmm.

1471
01:04:39,917 --> 01:04:41,460
-Actually, I was waiting.
-You were?

1472
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:43,004
Well… yeah.

1473
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:44,964
[music fades]

1474
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:47,258
-I just…
-I noticed that…

1475
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:49,844
that you had a lot on your mind yesterday.

1476
01:04:49,927 --> 01:04:51,262
-Right?
-You're right.

1477
01:04:51,345 --> 01:04:52,430
You seemed out of it.

1478
01:04:54,515 --> 01:04:58,144
So, I was going to talk to you yesterday,
but I didn't want to overwhelm you.

1479
01:04:58,227 --> 01:04:59,896
-Really?
-So, I just…

1480
01:05:00,771 --> 01:05:01,981
hung out alone.

1481
01:05:03,691 --> 01:05:04,817
Thank you. [chuckles]

1482
01:05:05,818 --> 01:05:07,320
So, are you still thinking?

1483
01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:08,237
Still?

1484
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:09,906
-Me?
-You can't stop worrying?

1485
01:05:10,531 --> 01:05:11,490
Mmm…

1486
01:05:12,366 --> 01:05:16,704
I did figure things out somewhat.

1487
01:05:16,787 --> 01:05:17,788
Hmm.

1488
01:05:19,415 --> 01:05:20,499
[Seung-li slurps]

1489
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:21,918
-And…
-Hmm?

1490
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:24,003
How about you?

1491
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:25,254
-How I feel?
-Yeah.

1492
01:05:25,338 --> 01:05:27,632
I'm not thinking too much.

1493
01:05:27,715 --> 01:05:29,091
-I'm not worrying either.
-Mmm.

1494
01:05:30,426 --> 01:05:32,219
I think I'm just…

1495
01:05:33,137 --> 01:05:34,221
going my way.

1496
01:05:35,723 --> 01:05:37,141
I think I'm doing well.

1497
01:05:37,808 --> 01:05:39,810
I mean, I… I think I…

1498
01:05:39,894 --> 01:05:41,938
-I think I'm communicating…
-I see.

1499
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:43,397
…my feelings well, I think.

1500
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:45,691
[Seung-li inhales]

1501
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:48,569
You might change your mind
after a date with me.

1502
01:05:49,487 --> 01:05:51,113
-I could.
-Yeah.

1503
01:05:51,197 --> 01:05:52,865
-I could disappoint you.
-Hmm.

1504
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:55,201
You'd think,
"She's different from what I thought,"

1505
01:05:55,284 --> 01:05:57,203
-and look for someone else.
-Mmm.

1506
01:05:58,913 --> 01:05:59,747
That could…

1507
01:06:00,456 --> 01:06:01,999
-change, of course.
-Mmm.

1508
01:06:02,875 --> 01:06:03,960
But…

1509
01:06:05,252 --> 01:06:07,546
I just want to keep getting to know you.

1510
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:10,299
-Mmm…
-I mean, who you are as a person.

1511
01:06:11,676 --> 01:06:16,597
So, I personally think
I'm quite an unstable person.

1512
01:06:17,556 --> 01:06:20,434
Unstable? I didn't really
feel that from you. Are you?

1513
01:06:21,352 --> 01:06:23,062
-Are you an unstable person?
-Mmm.

1514
01:06:23,145 --> 01:06:27,483
So, um, because I had
some really good memories with people,

1515
01:06:27,566 --> 01:06:30,695
but also bad ones that really hurt me.

1516
01:06:30,778 --> 01:06:32,613
So, I'm quite defensive.

1517
01:06:32,697 --> 01:06:35,992
So, when someone approaches me,
I think, "Why are they approaching me?"

1518
01:06:36,075 --> 01:06:37,576
"Do they want something?"

1519
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:39,620
-Even when they just look at me, I think…
-Mmm.

1520
01:06:40,246 --> 01:06:41,998
"Why are they looking at me?"

1521
01:06:42,081 --> 01:06:43,833
"Is there something wrong with me?"

1522
01:06:44,959 --> 01:06:47,086
-Then you must feel really anxious.
-Yeah.

1523
01:06:47,169 --> 01:06:49,088
-You must've been this whole time…
-Yes.

1524
01:06:49,171 --> 01:06:50,673
…because guys kept approaching you.

1525
01:06:50,756 --> 01:06:52,925
That's why I'm always
in my room. [chuckles]

1526
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:54,010
Ah.

1527
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:57,972
That's normal, though.

1528
01:06:58,806 --> 01:07:00,683
-I mean, yeah… Mmm.
-That must be tiring.

1529
01:07:01,726 --> 01:07:03,352
-It's not easy.
-Mmm.

1530
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:05,021
Gosh, that must be hard.

1531
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:06,981
I think…

1532
01:07:08,107 --> 01:07:10,901
I'm such a weak person.

1533
01:07:10,985 --> 01:07:12,194
Weak person?

1534
01:07:12,278 --> 01:07:13,946
-Mmm. Mentally?
-For example, do you mean…

1535
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:15,906
-Oh, mentally weak?
-Yeah.

1536
01:07:15,990 --> 01:07:18,159
-Are you the type who is easily…
-[chuckles]

1537
01:07:18,242 --> 01:07:19,702
…influenced by others?

1538
01:07:20,494 --> 01:07:21,746
Easily influenced?

1539
01:07:21,829 --> 01:07:23,164
-I guess so.
-You know?

1540
01:07:23,247 --> 01:07:24,790
-Mmm.
-That's a total weakness.

1541
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:26,375
-Exactly.
-Exactly.

1542
01:07:27,418 --> 01:07:29,920
That's why you're going
back and forth right now.

1543
01:07:30,004 --> 01:07:31,005
-Thinking a lot.
-Yeah, I…

1544
01:07:31,088 --> 01:07:34,925
It's not just my ears but my mind.
I'm all over the place.

1545
01:07:35,885 --> 01:07:37,053
You're an interesting girl.

1546
01:07:37,136 --> 01:07:39,138
[charming music playing]

1547
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:43,476
-That's a very big weakness.
-Yeah, right?

1548
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:47,521
Are you going to see other women
because it's too much to handle, Seung-li?

1549
01:07:48,105 --> 01:07:49,690
I don't know about that.

1550
01:07:50,274 --> 01:07:52,860
Ugh, I'm worried! [chuckles]

1551
01:07:53,736 --> 01:07:54,653
I won't.

1552
01:07:57,865 --> 01:07:59,408
The mood has been totally lifted.

1553
01:07:59,492 --> 01:08:01,494
[Han-na] Is he saying
those things on purpose?

1554
01:08:01,577 --> 01:08:03,746
When you're full of concern,
and someone tells you,

1555
01:08:03,829 --> 01:08:07,124
"That's not a big deal,"
I find that person very attractive. Yeah.

1556
01:08:07,708 --> 01:08:09,418
-Mmm.
-[Eun-ji] Ji-su was calling it

1557
01:08:09,502 --> 01:08:10,961
her shortcoming or weakness…

1558
01:08:11,045 --> 01:08:12,296
-Mm-hmm.
-…but Seung-li asked,

1559
01:08:12,379 --> 01:08:14,048
-and said, all sweet…
-[Han-na] Aw.

1560
01:08:14,131 --> 01:08:16,092
-"Are you easily influenced?"
-[Car] Makes sense.

1561
01:08:16,175 --> 01:08:18,177
[Eun-ji] Really striking a chord
with that detail.

1562
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:20,387
I think Ji-su is leaning
toward Seung-li now.

1563
01:08:20,471 --> 01:08:22,932
-Yeah, I think he's doing very well.
-Yeah, right. Yeah.

1564
01:08:23,015 --> 01:08:24,225
I think you're right.

1565
01:08:24,308 --> 01:08:27,812
I think Seung-li
was a bit closer to the answer.

1566
01:08:27,895 --> 01:08:29,605
I didn't have an answer in mind,

1567
01:08:29,688 --> 01:08:31,565
but Hyun-kyu…

1568
01:08:32,483 --> 01:08:35,319
tried to empathize
and kind of understand me.

1569
01:08:36,070 --> 01:08:38,781
But when Seung-li said,
"Oh, that's what happened,"

1570
01:08:38,864 --> 01:08:41,075
and moved past it,

1571
01:08:41,158 --> 01:08:43,369
I felt a bit more comfortable.

1572
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:45,871
To carefully

1573
01:08:45,955 --> 01:08:49,458
-guess the type of person Ji-su likes…
-[Han-na] Mmm.

1574
01:08:49,542 --> 01:08:52,169
-…there's a sort of reliability…
-[Han-na] Ah.

1575
01:08:52,253 --> 01:08:54,547
-…that a simple person has.
-I see that. Yeah.

1576
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:57,133
[Car] She really seems to feel
more comfortable with the energy

1577
01:08:57,216 --> 01:08:59,176
and "reliability" of a simple person.

1578
01:08:59,260 --> 01:09:03,764
Honestly, I think Ji-su just doesn't like
guys who talk too much.

1579
01:09:03,848 --> 01:09:05,182
[laughs heartily]

1580
01:09:05,266 --> 01:09:07,017
-[Car] Yeah, minimum dialogue.
-[Han-na] Ah.

1581
01:09:07,101 --> 01:09:09,395
-[Eun-ji laughs]
-So, she likes Seung-li more?

1582
01:09:09,478 --> 01:09:12,231
I think so, and it seems to be by a lot.

1583
01:09:12,314 --> 01:09:15,317
I do think she is definitely leaning now
more towards Seung-li.

1584
01:09:15,401 --> 01:09:17,194
[mellow music playing]

1585
01:09:17,278 --> 01:09:19,238
Where are you going? Where are you going?

1586
01:09:19,321 --> 01:09:20,489
[Eun-ji and Han-na laugh]

1587
01:09:23,534 --> 01:09:24,660
[In-guk] Here's Mi-ji.

1588
01:09:26,203 --> 01:09:27,913
[Eun-ji] His mood is a bit different.

1589
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:30,791
[sighs] Oh.

1590
01:09:40,759 --> 01:09:41,969
[music fades]

1591
01:09:42,052 --> 01:09:43,554
-[Eun-ji] Ah…
-[Car] He came.

1592
01:09:44,096 --> 01:09:46,015
She clearly told him not to choose her.

1593
01:09:46,098 --> 01:09:48,058
-She clearly told him not to come.
-Right, yes.

1594
01:09:48,142 --> 01:09:48,976
[In-guk] Mmm.

1595
01:09:49,810 --> 01:09:50,644
[Sang-ho] Oh, boy…

1596
01:09:51,228 --> 01:09:52,104
[Sang-ho chuckles]

1597
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:53,981
SECRET DATE
JI-SU & SANG-HO

1598
01:09:54,064 --> 01:09:55,816
Hello. [sighs]

1599
01:09:57,151 --> 01:09:58,027
Hey.

1600
01:09:58,569 --> 01:10:01,155
-Just have a serious conversation.
-[Car] Let's hear him out.

1601
01:10:01,238 --> 01:10:03,782
-We didn't get to hear Sang-ho's story.
-[Eun-ji] That's true.

1602
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:05,868
[groovy music playing]

1603
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:09,455
-Yeah.
-[music fades]

1604
01:10:09,538 --> 01:10:10,998
Uh, were you waiting long?

1605
01:10:11,081 --> 01:10:13,209
-Yeah, I've been here for a while.
-Oh.

1606
01:10:13,292 --> 01:10:14,710
[splutters] I'm sorry.

1607
01:10:17,004 --> 01:10:18,464
[both chuckle]

1608
01:10:18,547 --> 01:10:20,132
I didn't… expect this.

1609
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:21,217
Why?

1610
01:10:21,300 --> 01:10:23,969
Because I had said that in the morning.

1611
01:10:24,053 --> 01:10:24,887
Hmm.

1612
01:10:25,429 --> 01:10:26,972
I figured you would've gone

1613
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:28,682
-to talk to someone else.
-Mm-hmm.

1614
01:10:28,766 --> 01:10:31,060
Hence my surprise
when you opened the door.

1615
01:10:31,143 --> 01:10:32,853
-Surprise?
-Yeah.

1616
01:10:32,937 --> 01:10:35,481
-Not in a negative way, but like, "What?"
-Yeah, I get it…

1617
01:10:35,564 --> 01:10:36,690
-"Oh, I see." Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

1618
01:10:38,150 --> 01:10:38,984
[exhales]

1619
01:10:39,068 --> 01:10:40,236
I also…

1620
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:42,655
I wanted to choose you,
but I was kind of hesitant

1621
01:10:42,738 --> 01:10:44,573
because I didn't want to pressure you.

1622
01:10:45,324 --> 01:10:46,492
But when I thought about it,

1623
01:10:46,575 --> 01:10:49,203
I thought, "Why see someone
I'm not interested in?"

1624
01:10:49,286 --> 01:10:51,205
-Mmm.
-That's what I was thinking.

1625
01:10:52,164 --> 01:10:54,500
I thought I should choose
the person I liked.

1626
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:55,960
-Ah.
-That seemed right.

1627
01:10:56,710 --> 01:10:59,713
I just really wanted to talk to you,
if possible.

1628
01:11:02,091 --> 01:11:03,842
[hesitates] What you said earlier…

1629
01:11:03,926 --> 01:11:07,513
That not… choosing me
is putting pressure on me,

1630
01:11:07,596 --> 01:11:10,224
I don't want you to think that. I just…

1631
01:11:10,307 --> 01:11:11,392
Ah.

1632
01:11:13,352 --> 01:11:14,770
I really like you.

1633
01:11:15,646 --> 01:11:16,730
Yeah, well, so…

1634
01:11:17,314 --> 01:11:19,775
If it doesn't work out,
I just want you to know that.

1635
01:11:20,359 --> 01:11:23,070
-Ah. Then, it's okay. Yeah.
-Right.

1636
01:11:23,153 --> 01:11:27,074
Actually, we went
on a date before, just us,

1637
01:11:27,157 --> 01:11:30,119
but we didn't really talk much
or anything like that.

1638
01:11:30,202 --> 01:11:32,746
I should have expressed myself.

1639
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:35,040
It's something I really regret. Really.

1640
01:11:35,666 --> 01:11:37,293
-But back then…
-Mmm.

1641
01:11:37,376 --> 01:11:41,672
…I wasn't really on your mind, was I?

1642
01:11:42,423 --> 01:11:44,216
I mean, it's not that.

1643
01:11:44,883 --> 01:11:46,510
-I was just so out of it then.
-Mmm.

1644
01:11:47,261 --> 01:11:51,974
Back then, it was tough because
we'd just gotten here, and I was frazzled.

1645
01:11:52,057 --> 01:11:54,685
-Things started happening and, yeah…
-Mmm.

1646
01:11:54,768 --> 01:11:57,771
Now that I think about it,
I think I acted pretty strange.

1647
01:11:57,855 --> 01:11:59,023
-I can't… [groans]
-But, like,

1648
01:11:59,106 --> 01:12:02,359
at that point, everybody
was being super careful and reserved.

1649
01:12:02,443 --> 01:12:03,569
Ah, right. Me too.

1650
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:06,322
But that was natural, though.

1651
01:12:06,405 --> 01:12:08,532
I should at least… try harder.

1652
01:12:08,615 --> 01:12:10,576
[Car] It's a little too late for that now.

1653
01:12:10,659 --> 01:12:11,660
[Eun-ji] Yeah.

1654
01:12:11,744 --> 01:12:13,746
[mellow music playing]

1655
01:12:14,538 --> 01:12:15,581
Hmm.

1656
01:12:16,957 --> 01:12:17,791
[music fades]

1657
01:12:17,875 --> 01:12:21,170
It was a longer version
of our morning conversation.

1658
01:12:22,046 --> 01:12:23,589
But maybe I was…

1659
01:12:24,214 --> 01:12:27,551
trying to be too nice about it.

1660
01:12:27,634 --> 01:12:29,094
[pensive music playing]

1661
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:32,014
I later thought,
"Am I still leading him on?"

1662
01:12:32,598 --> 01:12:36,143
"Oh, should I have been
more direct about the whole thing?"

1663
01:12:36,727 --> 01:12:38,187
Since I told Sang-ho that…

1664
01:12:39,730 --> 01:12:40,939
that I, uh…

1665
01:12:41,648 --> 01:12:47,571
I no longer want to feel bad
or feel pressured. Yeah.

1666
01:12:49,615 --> 01:12:53,077
Suddenly, I liked her even more
after the date was over because…

1667
01:12:53,160 --> 01:12:54,828
-Suddenly now?
-Even more?

1668
01:12:54,912 --> 01:12:55,746
-Hey.
-Wait.

1669
01:12:55,829 --> 01:12:57,247
I mean, I'm sorry, but…

1670
01:12:57,331 --> 01:12:59,625
-From the first date…
-…he doesn't know the rules.

1671
01:12:59,708 --> 01:13:00,876
"The rules."

1672
01:13:00,959 --> 01:13:03,170
We're not asking about
your initial attraction.

1673
01:13:03,253 --> 01:13:05,130
I've never seen someone like this before.

1674
01:13:05,214 --> 01:13:06,757
-[In-guk] Incredible.
-This isn't it.

1675
01:13:06,840 --> 01:13:09,176
I get nervous
whenever Sang-ho starts talking.

1676
01:13:09,259 --> 01:13:12,388
When I showed up even after
what she said this morning…

1677
01:13:12,888 --> 01:13:16,517
Even though she didn't say it directly,
like, "I'm okay with you coming."

1678
01:13:17,017 --> 01:13:20,104
She didn't directly say it,
but I was glad that she kind of said,

1679
01:13:20,187 --> 01:13:21,939
"I'm thankful that you came."

1680
01:13:22,022 --> 01:13:23,399
But she didn't say she was happy.

1681
01:13:23,482 --> 01:13:24,817
She didn't. [laughs]

1682
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:26,944
Hence my surprise
when you opened the door.

1683
01:13:27,027 --> 01:13:28,278
-Surprise?
-Yeah.

1684
01:13:28,362 --> 01:13:30,656
-Not in a negative way, but like, "What?"
-Yeah, I get it…

1685
01:13:30,739 --> 01:13:31,865
"Oh, I see." Yeah.

1686
01:13:31,949 --> 01:13:33,492
MISTOOK "SURPRISED" WITH "GLAD"

1687
01:13:33,575 --> 01:13:35,369
If she wasn't interested at all,

1688
01:13:35,452 --> 01:13:39,289
Ji-su wouldn't have said
it was okay or nice when I came.

1689
01:13:39,373 --> 01:13:41,333
And with what she told me at the end,

1690
01:13:41,417 --> 01:13:44,711
I thought she could tell me
because she now trusted me a bit.

1691
01:13:44,795 --> 01:13:46,130
That made me happy.

1692
01:13:46,213 --> 01:13:48,090
I thought I should
really give Ji-su my all.

1693
01:13:48,173 --> 01:13:51,427
My full attention
until she… makes up her mind.

1694
01:13:51,510 --> 01:13:54,054
-Oh, wow. If he gives her his all now…
-[Car] Sang-ho, you…

1695
01:13:54,138 --> 01:13:55,931
-No.
-…she'll totally run the other way.

1696
01:13:56,014 --> 01:13:56,890
[Car] Yes. Of course.

1697
01:13:56,974 --> 01:13:58,767
-Seriously.
-[Eun-ji] That's true.

1698
01:13:58,851 --> 01:14:01,478
Whoever was with him
during the interview, please help him now.

1699
01:14:01,562 --> 01:14:03,355
-You should've told him.
-Who asked him that?

1700
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:05,983
-Why didn't you tell Sang-ho?
-Where's his camera director?

1701
01:14:06,066 --> 01:14:07,901
-[Han-na] They stood up.
-Can someone see him?

1702
01:14:07,985 --> 01:14:10,112
-[Eun-ji] What were you all doing?
-[laughter]

1703
01:14:10,195 --> 01:14:12,781
-Must've heard everything, audio director.
-Should've told him.

1704
01:14:12,865 --> 01:14:14,825
Why did you just sit back and watch?

1705
01:14:14,908 --> 01:14:16,326
You're all so cruel.

1706
01:14:16,410 --> 01:14:18,495
-You're all so mean, seriously.
-[Car] This kid is…

1707
01:14:18,579 --> 01:14:20,289
Let me try and figure out what…

1708
01:14:21,123 --> 01:14:22,666
-Sang-ho must be thinking.
-Oh, how?

1709
01:14:22,749 --> 01:14:25,127
"God. I feel bad
for Seung-li and Hyun-kyu."

1710
01:14:25,210 --> 01:14:26,879
-[laughs]
-[Han-na laughs]

1711
01:14:26,962 --> 01:14:29,465
-"Jumping in at the last minute…"
-"Rocking the boat too much?"

1712
01:14:29,548 --> 01:14:30,549
Ah.

1713
01:14:31,425 --> 01:14:33,093
-Okay, you think that.
-[Eun-ji] So funny.

1714
01:14:33,177 --> 01:14:34,595
[Han-na] What should we do?

1715
01:14:37,389 --> 01:14:38,932
[Han-na] Oh, Do's date.

1716
01:14:39,016 --> 01:14:41,810
I think Do is really glowing today.

1717
01:14:41,894 --> 01:14:43,061
There's no clock here.

1718
01:14:43,145 --> 01:14:44,855
[pensive music playing]

1719
01:14:49,359 --> 01:14:50,569
[breathes heavily]

1720
01:14:52,779 --> 01:14:54,865
[Do] Gosh. "Why isn't anyone coming?"

1721
01:14:55,532 --> 01:14:56,700
"Did I not get chosen?"

1722
01:14:57,367 --> 01:14:58,827
"What's going on?"

1723
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:02,206
My thoughts were racing.

1724
01:15:03,457 --> 01:15:05,167
[pensive music continues]

1725
01:15:08,337 --> 01:15:11,215
[Min-hong] I waited there,
thinking to myself,

1726
01:15:11,298 --> 01:15:13,509
"I really hope Jeong-mok shows up."

1727
01:15:17,554 --> 01:15:18,514
[music fades]

1728
01:15:19,056 --> 01:15:20,849
[mellow music playing]

1729
01:15:21,475 --> 01:15:22,935
Wow. Jeong-mok looks cool today.

1730
01:15:23,018 --> 01:15:24,728
-[Han-na] His hair…
-[Eun-ji] Netflix face.

1731
01:15:30,150 --> 01:15:31,693
I wonder where he's going.

1732
01:15:38,492 --> 01:15:39,451
[Han-na] Oh.

1733
01:15:39,952 --> 01:15:42,496
-[Car] Oh, yeah.
-[Han-na] Of course. It's Do.

1734
01:15:42,579 --> 01:15:44,039
[Eun-ji exclaims]

1735
01:15:44,122 --> 01:15:45,916
[groovy upbeat music playing]

1736
01:15:46,708 --> 01:15:47,793
[Do] Hello.

1737
01:15:49,378 --> 01:15:50,212
Hey.

1738
01:15:53,298 --> 01:15:54,758
SECRET DATE
YI DO & JEONG-MOK

1739
01:15:54,841 --> 01:15:56,969
I think Do got butterflies
from seeing him in a suit.

1740
01:15:57,052 --> 01:15:59,012
-Yeah, he looks cool. So, so cool.
-[Eun-ji] Ah.

1741
01:16:00,889 --> 01:16:01,848
[music fades]

1742
01:16:02,599 --> 01:16:04,601
[wistful music playing]

1743
01:16:06,645 --> 01:16:07,771
[cell phone chimes]

1744
01:16:07,854 --> 01:16:08,689
What is this?

1745
01:16:11,775 --> 01:16:13,193
YOUR DATE HAS ENDED

1746
01:16:13,277 --> 01:16:14,278
[Han-na] Oh, Min-hong.

1747
01:16:14,361 --> 01:16:16,238
-[Eun-ji] Nobody?
-[Han-na] Nobody.

1748
01:16:18,365 --> 01:16:20,742
LAST NIGHT

1749
01:16:20,826 --> 01:16:23,954
Well, if I somehow
do get a chance tomorrow,

1750
01:16:24,037 --> 01:16:25,455
I want to hang out with you.

1751
01:16:26,123 --> 01:16:27,833
That's really my only wish.

1752
01:16:33,547 --> 01:16:36,383
Five guys liking me isn't important.

1753
01:16:36,466 --> 01:16:37,884
All I need is one person.

1754
01:16:37,968 --> 01:16:39,052
[both chuckle]

1755
01:16:39,761 --> 01:16:42,139
[Min-hong] There isn't anything
I can do about this,

1756
01:16:42,222 --> 01:16:45,684
and I said what I wanted to say
without any regrets,

1757
01:16:45,767 --> 01:16:49,354
so I don't need to feel sad or happy
because I'm at peace with it.

1758
01:16:49,438 --> 01:16:51,648
I just accepted it and came back home.

1759
01:16:52,566 --> 01:16:54,693
I do still have feelings for Jeong-mok.

1760
01:16:54,776 --> 01:16:57,571
If I like him, I like him.
I should keep fighting.

1761
01:16:57,654 --> 01:16:58,864
Yeah, that's how I feel.

1762
01:17:01,491 --> 01:17:03,118
What took you so long?

1763
01:17:03,201 --> 01:17:04,328
[music fades]

1764
01:17:04,411 --> 01:17:05,412
-Huh?
-Hmm.

1765
01:17:05,495 --> 01:17:07,289
I waited for so long.

1766
01:17:07,372 --> 01:17:08,332
For how long?

1767
01:17:08,415 --> 01:17:09,583
-A lot.
-A lot?

1768
01:17:09,666 --> 01:17:10,584
Yeah.

1769
01:17:10,667 --> 01:17:11,752
[chuckles softly]

1770
01:17:12,544 --> 01:17:13,629
[enchanting music playing]

1771
01:17:13,712 --> 01:17:15,714
[Do] When Jeong-mok came in,

1772
01:17:15,797 --> 01:17:18,425
seeing him outside
of the resort one-on-one

1773
01:17:18,508 --> 01:17:20,260
felt very different.

1774
01:17:20,344 --> 01:17:22,012
I even got butterflies.

1775
01:17:25,599 --> 01:17:26,767
Hey, you two can't kiss.

1776
01:17:26,850 --> 01:17:29,811
-I… I'm a little worried too.
-We were all nervous.

1777
01:17:29,895 --> 01:17:32,773
-[Eun-ji] I felt they wanted to kiss.
-Oh, eye contact? Yeah.

1778
01:17:32,856 --> 01:17:33,899
[Eun-ji] Yeah.

1779
01:17:33,982 --> 01:17:35,400
-[Do] So…
-Mmm?

1780
01:17:36,026 --> 01:17:38,445
You said I was your first impression pick.

1781
01:17:38,528 --> 01:17:39,696
Why did you pick me?

1782
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:41,198
I liked your eyes.

1783
01:17:41,281 --> 01:17:43,742
-Oh, were my eyes pure?
-Your eyes were pure.

1784
01:17:43,825 --> 01:17:45,035
-[chuckles softly]
-I…

1785
01:17:45,827 --> 01:17:47,496
And you had a bright smile.

1786
01:17:47,579 --> 01:17:49,373
Oh, really? When we first met?

1787
01:17:49,456 --> 01:17:50,457
You stood out.

1788
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:53,085
-Your look and your color, I guess.
-Ah.

1789
01:17:53,168 --> 01:17:55,003
Right, right. Hmm.

1790
01:17:55,587 --> 01:17:56,963
-Second…
-Same.

1791
01:17:57,047 --> 01:17:59,174
-What?
-Why was I your first impression pick?

1792
01:18:00,175 --> 01:18:02,260
Well, when you were walking up,

1793
01:18:02,344 --> 01:18:03,178
I thought,

1794
01:18:03,762 --> 01:18:06,014
"That guy seems like he's nice."

1795
01:18:06,098 --> 01:18:07,349
-Hmm.
-Hmm.

1796
01:18:08,850 --> 01:18:09,685
Hmm.

1797
01:18:11,144 --> 01:18:14,147
Do you have anything
you want to do on a date?

1798
01:18:15,190 --> 01:18:16,400
On a date?

1799
01:18:16,483 --> 01:18:17,901
Just normally.

1800
01:18:17,984 --> 01:18:19,528
[mellow music playing]

1801
01:18:19,611 --> 01:18:20,821
[Jeong-mok] Mmm…

1802
01:18:20,904 --> 01:18:26,118
I want to do things
I can do as a university student.

1803
01:18:26,201 --> 01:18:27,703
-You know?
-Ah.

1804
01:18:28,620 --> 01:18:29,454
Like…?

1805
01:18:29,538 --> 01:18:32,040
-Meeting up when I don't have class.
-Yeah.

1806
01:18:32,124 --> 01:18:35,335
Going out to eat
or pulling all-nighters during exam week.

1807
01:18:35,419 --> 01:18:36,795
I want to do…

1808
01:18:37,629 --> 01:18:38,880
normal things.

1809
01:18:38,964 --> 01:18:40,841
-Like this. I…
-Mmm.

1810
01:18:41,508 --> 01:18:42,968
But I like anything,

1811
01:18:43,510 --> 01:18:46,138
-so it's more important who I do it with.
-Does that mean…

1812
01:18:46,763 --> 01:18:48,724
Do you like bowling too? [chuckles]

1813
01:18:49,766 --> 01:18:51,852
With you, I like… everything.

1814
01:18:51,935 --> 01:18:53,186
Oh, really?

1815
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:58,066
I mean, these two…
already seem like a couple.

1816
01:18:58,150 --> 01:19:00,694
-They're dating.
-[Car] Seriously, though.

1817
01:19:00,777 --> 01:19:03,029
-They are, right?
-It's been a while, I think.

1818
01:19:03,113 --> 01:19:04,698
They've been on so many dates already.

1819
01:19:04,781 --> 01:19:07,492
You know how when we start dating someone,
you ask things like,

1820
01:19:07,576 --> 01:19:09,870
"Remember that one time?
Why did you do that to me?"

1821
01:19:09,953 --> 01:19:11,079
-[Car and In-guk] Oh.
-Right.

1822
01:19:11,163 --> 01:19:13,957
-[Eun-ji] Doesn't it feel like that?
-They've gone over to that stage.

1823
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:16,126
[enchanting music playing]

1824
01:19:16,918 --> 01:19:17,919
What do you like?

1825
01:19:18,003 --> 01:19:19,880
-What?
-Do you prefer certain types of dates?

1826
01:19:19,963 --> 01:19:22,883
I was also so sad
that I never dated on campus.

1827
01:19:22,966 --> 01:19:24,718
-Oh, I see.
-Like,

1828
01:19:24,801 --> 01:19:26,803
-couples study together at the library…
-Right.

1829
01:19:26,887 --> 01:19:30,348
…even though
they're studying different subjects.

1830
01:19:31,183 --> 01:19:32,434
-Yeah. Mmm.
-Things like that.

1831
01:19:32,517 --> 01:19:35,896
And also, lining up to eat
at the cafeteria together.

1832
01:19:35,979 --> 01:19:37,230
-Things like that.
-[Han-na] Oh…

1833
01:19:37,314 --> 01:19:39,357
-They have many things they wanna do.
-[In-guk] Mmm.

1834
01:19:40,317 --> 01:19:42,319
-As for your school…
-Yeah.

1835
01:19:43,820 --> 01:19:45,864
-I'll come over often.
-[Han-na] Oh, what?

1836
01:19:45,947 --> 01:19:47,199
-My school?
-Yeah!

1837
01:19:47,824 --> 01:19:49,075
Isn't it too far?

1838
01:19:49,826 --> 01:19:50,952
-It's not--
-I'd still go.

1839
01:19:51,036 --> 01:19:53,288
[Han-na] It's not far.
It's not far at all.

1840
01:19:54,206 --> 01:19:57,125
Jeong-mok said, "I'll go to your school."

1841
01:19:57,793 --> 01:19:59,002
I thought,

1842
01:19:59,085 --> 01:20:02,297
"We can continue to keep in touch
while we're in Seoul."

1843
01:20:02,881 --> 01:20:06,134
-I was… so happy.
-[Eun-ji] What is this now?

1844
01:20:06,218 --> 01:20:07,594
Is this official?

1845
01:20:07,677 --> 01:20:08,637
Is it Day 1?

1846
01:20:09,304 --> 01:20:11,014
Do you have female friends?

1847
01:20:11,097 --> 01:20:12,557
Friends? No, I…

1848
01:20:12,641 --> 01:20:14,017
I don't think I have one.

1849
01:20:14,100 --> 01:20:17,145
I think I actually found
lifelong friends here,

1850
01:20:17,229 --> 01:20:18,563
like… [hesitates] Ji-yeon.

1851
01:20:18,647 --> 01:20:20,357
-Oh, really? Mm-hmm.
-[chuckles]

1852
01:20:20,440 --> 01:20:21,942
You became friends?

1853
01:20:22,651 --> 01:20:24,027
We… Yeah, we're friends.

1854
01:20:24,694 --> 01:20:26,154
Are… aren't we?

1855
01:20:26,238 --> 01:20:27,364
Does she also think so?

1856
01:20:27,447 --> 01:20:29,449
-[Cupids] Oh!
-I'm joking.

1857
01:20:29,533 --> 01:20:31,243
[Han-na] Worrying about the female friend?

1858
01:20:31,326 --> 01:20:34,204
-Isn't Do's reaction a bit animated?
-[In-guk] Yeah, just now. Just now.

1859
01:20:34,287 --> 01:20:37,249
-Just now. Totally.
-Yeah, it was an American reaction.

1860
01:20:37,833 --> 01:20:39,709
-Mmm. How often do you…
-Mmm?

1861
01:20:39,793 --> 01:20:41,503
…prefer to go on dates?

1862
01:20:41,586 --> 01:20:43,171
-Yeah.
-How often? Well…

1863
01:20:43,255 --> 01:20:45,257
If… if you're in a relationship.

1864
01:20:45,966 --> 01:20:48,218
[enchanting music playing]

1865
01:20:48,301 --> 01:20:49,344
How often?

1866
01:20:52,222 --> 01:20:54,015
It'd be nice to meet often.

1867
01:20:54,099 --> 01:20:55,809
-Right.
-As often as we can.

1868
01:20:56,810 --> 01:20:59,479
Do you have any particular preferences?

1869
01:20:59,563 --> 01:21:00,856
I'd like to meet often.

1870
01:21:02,274 --> 01:21:04,568
-[splutters] What… hold on. What?
-[In-guk] Hey!

1871
01:21:04,651 --> 01:21:06,862
-Ah… director, I love the angle.
-[Eun-ji] What?

1872
01:21:06,945 --> 01:21:09,030
-Great angle, director.
-[Han-na] Oh, what is this?

1873
01:21:09,573 --> 01:21:13,869
Mm-hmm. How many dates
do you think you'll have today?

1874
01:21:13,952 --> 01:21:15,078
Take a guess.

1875
01:21:16,371 --> 01:21:17,414
I just want one.

1876
01:21:18,373 --> 01:21:19,416
-Oh…
-[In-guk] What?

1877
01:21:19,499 --> 01:21:20,917
-[Han-na] Just with her?
-[chuckles]

1878
01:21:24,087 --> 01:21:25,297
I just want one date.

1879
01:21:25,380 --> 01:21:26,715
[In-guk] Great answer.

1880
01:21:30,051 --> 01:21:33,847
[Do] "Oh, this guy continuously
expresses his feelings to me."

1881
01:21:33,930 --> 01:21:36,850
"I should take this… very seriously."

1882
01:21:36,933 --> 01:21:39,019
That's what was running through my head.

1883
01:21:40,353 --> 01:21:42,230
Jeong-mok is it for me.

1884
01:21:42,772 --> 01:21:45,317
[Han-na] Ah. "Jeong-mok is it for me."

1885
01:21:47,068 --> 01:21:49,821
THE NEXT NIGHT

1886
01:21:49,905 --> 01:21:52,407
-[melancholic music playing]
-[Do sobbing]

1887
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:01,499
[Do] Oh, you… you took everything.

1888
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:03,168
Who do you think you are?

1889
01:22:03,251 --> 01:22:05,253
