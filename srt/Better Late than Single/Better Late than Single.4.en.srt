00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:08,007
[bright groovy music playing]

2
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:11,010
NOH JAE-YUN
HA JEONG-MOK

3
00:00:11,094 --> 00:00:12,470
[Jae-yun] Who's your date partner?

4
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:14,806
Oh, Min-hong?

5
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:17,225
[Jeong-mok grunts] Should I ask if…

6
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:19,352
I can wear my glasses?

7
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:21,021
[Eun-ji] Who will he ask?

8
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:23,523
-[Han-na] Is he gonna ask Min-hong?
-[Eun-ji] Oh, you think?

9
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:28,445
Should I wear my glasses or not?

10
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:31,448
-Do it.
-Yeah? Okay.

11
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,074
That kind of makes my heart flutter.

12
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:35,994
You know, like when a guy
comes up to you before practice

13
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:39,205
and asks you to hang on to his watch
and phone so he can go play soccer?

14
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:41,708
[chuckling] Definitely.
No doubt that's an expression.

15
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:44,335
-Oh, does that make your heart flutter?
-[Han-na] For sure.

16
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:46,921
-"Hey, hang onto this." Kind of like that.
-[Han-na] Right.

17
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:48,214
[pleasant music playing]

18
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:50,300
Min-hong looks like she liked that.

19
00:00:54,053 --> 00:00:55,013
[exhales heavily]

20
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:59,350
-[Jae-yun] What did she say?
-Wear them.

21
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,771
[Car] He does look pretty cool
with glasses on.

22
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:05,106
[Eun-ji] A person
looks gentler with glasses.

23
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:08,276
[Jeong-mok] Ugh,
this is making me nervous, suddenly.

24
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:12,322
ONE-ON-ONE DATE
MIN-HONG & JEONG-MOK

25
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:13,281
[Min-hong] Let's go.

26
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:14,657
[music fades]

27
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:16,201
What time did you sleep?

28
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:17,535
[Jeong-mok inhales deeply]

29
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:21,414
About 2:30? Maybe 3:00 in the morning?

30
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:29,839
Where'd you get those stickers?

31
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,174
Oh, did you see that?

32
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:32,550
-Of course.
-When did you see?

33
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,344
-I saw it this morning. Yeah.
-Really?

34
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:35,637
Well, I like stickers,

35
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,722
-so I brought my sticker collection.
-Really?

36
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:39,349
[mellow music playing]

37
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:43,353
Actually, because of the stickers,
I figured it was from Min-hong.

38
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:46,272
When we went on a date before,

39
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:49,943
I remember hearing that she'd brought
things to decorate her diary with.

40
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,113
I like decorating my diary
with stickers and stuff.

41
00:01:53,196 --> 00:01:55,365
I brought a whole container of stickers.

42
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,534
-You did?
-[Min-hong] Yeah, I'll show you.

43
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:58,827
JEONG-MOK REMEMBERED HER WORDS

44
00:01:59,702 --> 00:02:02,330
[Jeong-mok] So, I was sure
it was from Min-hong.

45
00:02:02,413 --> 00:02:04,207
[enchanting music playing]

46
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:08,378
I was taken aback because he said,
"Where did you get the stickers?"

47
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,339
I think he totally caught on.

48
00:02:14,259 --> 00:02:16,136
[Eun-ji and Car exclaim]

49
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:19,472
[inhales] Wow, he must be really good
at catching details.

50
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,182
[Eun-ji] He has a good eye for things.

51
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:24,060
And isn't it cooler that he asked,
"Where did you get the stickers?"

52
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,770
And not, "You wrote me a card, right?"

53
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:29,274
Yeah, he asked in a considerate way
so she doesn't feel pressured.

54
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:34,237
What did Jae-yun say about
my first impression last night?

55
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,740
Oh, he said I seemed bossy.
Right, he was kind of stammering…

56
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,410
Not bossy, but like, "not a pushover." So…

57
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:44,873
But I think my personality is like this
because I have a younger brother.

58
00:02:44,956 --> 00:02:47,208
And he's not a chill brother,

59
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:50,503
he's pretty high energy,
so I think I also…

60
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:54,674
I'm tough to deal with, huh?

61
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:55,925
-No.
-Aren't I?

62
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:57,927
Who told you that?

63
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,846
Well, just from what I've seen,

64
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:02,348
the other women seem really feminine,

65
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,392
in terms of personality.

66
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:06,561
You're feminine too.

67
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:08,062
-[Eun-ji gasps]
-[Han-na] Hey, he's…

68
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:10,440
-[Car] What's up with Jeong-mok?
-I… I doubt that's true.

69
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,483
Jeong-mok is practically Dex!

70
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,319
He's driving me crazy.

71
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:17,989
Min-hong must've brought that up because
Jeong-mok might think she's too tough too.

72
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:19,741
-Must've bothered her.
-[Eun-ji] Could be…

73
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:21,618
But you know, when a guy tells you,

74
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:24,787
"I think you're cute,
I think you're cute," over and over,

75
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,998
-you can't help but act the part.
-Yeah, right.

76
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:29,667
-So, Jeong-mok really answered wisely.
-Good response.

77
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:34,047
Min-hong might show us another side of her
that we haven't seen before. Maybe.

78
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,340
[pleasant music playing]

79
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:37,008
Do you have a favorite drink?

80
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:43,306
I like beer, but I start feeling drunk
after a single pint. [chuckles]

81
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,726
-Yeah, I do too.
-[Han-na] Hey, something in common.

82
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:48,645
-Oh, really?
-Hey, me too.

83
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,480
And I retook the CSAT too.

84
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,106
I'm curious. I want to go.

85
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,608
[Han-na] She keeps saying "me too."

86
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:55,526
Sea or mountain?

87
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:56,819
The sea.

88
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,112
Me too. The sea.

89
00:03:58,196 --> 00:04:00,114
But don't most people
like the sea? Or not?

90
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:02,659
No, lots of people prefer the mountains.

91
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:05,662
It seems like Min-hong
is changing before my eyes.

92
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,622
She seemed like an icy princess at first.

93
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:09,290
She did, but she's not.

94
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,334
-She's quite lovely.
-[Han-na] I know.

95
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:12,835
[Jeong-mok] Oh?

96
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:16,047
Is this it?

97
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,342
[Min-hong] Oh, yeah. Right, right.

98
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,094
"Ghost Town."

99
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:22,637
GHOST TOWN
A HAUNTED HOUSE EXPERIENCE

100
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,264
-[Han-na] What is this?
-"Ghosts?"

101
00:04:24,347 --> 00:04:26,391
-[Eun-ji] Wow…
-This could lead to body contact.

102
00:04:26,474 --> 00:04:29,227
Oh, this is meant to
encourage physical contact, right?

103
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,646
-[In-guk] It naturally happens.
-[Han-na] Of course.

104
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:34,857
[Min-hong] I was so happy
to go to the haunted house.

105
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:35,984
-[Car] What?
-[Han-na] Why?

106
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:40,321
The thing about eternal singles
is that we're book smart about dating.

107
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:43,825
I heard that people's hearts race
while watching a horror movie,

108
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:46,411
but it makes them wonder
if their hearts are racing

109
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:50,415
because of the person they're with
or the movie they're watching.

110
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:54,419
I just hoped that Jeong-mok's heart
is racing because of me.

111
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:56,045
[whimsical music playing]

112
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,130
That's so cute.

113
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:59,424
-Seriously. She's adorable.
-Oh, my goodness.

114
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:02,635
[Eun-ji] It's hot out too, so getting
chills down your spine might be nice.

115
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,012
-[In-guk] Right.
-[Han-na] Oh.

116
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,054
[In-guk] So scary.

117
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,724
[Eun-ji] This place is scary.
Not your average haunted house.

118
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:08,808
Yeah.

119
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:12,020
-[Jeong-mok] Oh, people might pop out.
-Let's not do this.

120
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:14,397
-[eerie music playing]
-[Jeong-mok] Oh, man. I won't look.

121
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,857
[chuckles nervously]

122
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:17,734
Oh, man, it's shaking too.

123
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:19,861
-[eerie growling]
-Oh.

124
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,530
-That's terrifying.
-[Eun-ji] This place is brutal.

125
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:23,906
[Jeong-mok] God, that scared me.

126
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:27,410
Oh, that scared me.
[chuckles nervously] That scared me.

127
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,162
[eerie screaming]

128
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:30,747
-[Han-na] It's pitch black.
-Oh, no.

129
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,873
[Min-hong] My feet are…

130
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:33,708
-I can't see where I'm going.
-Hang on.

131
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:36,419
-What should we do? Should I go first?
-[Min-hong] Yeah.

132
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:37,628
[deep growl]

133
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:38,880
Hold hands and walk.

134
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:42,300
[Jeong-mok] Which way is forward?
I can't see anything.

135
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:43,509
[growling continues]

136
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:47,764
[Min-hong] It's shaking too much.

137
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,807
[Eun-ji] Are they holding hands?
They are, right?

138
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,809
-Hold my hand.
-[Han-na] Did she take his hand?

139
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:52,894
-Did she?
-[Car] Did she?

140
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:56,355
-Oh, they're holding each other like this.
-She's holding his forearm.

141
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:59,400
I wasn't thinking about
grabbing his hand at all.

142
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:02,612
I don't remember,
but I probably grabbed him first.

143
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,572
Or maybe he told me to hold his hand,

144
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:08,159
so I first held his arm and kept
moving down, down, down, like that.

145
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:09,911
[cheerful music playing]

146
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:11,913
-I mean, I can't see anything.
-[loud shriek]

147
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:12,830
-My God.
-Oh, my God.

148
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:14,791
-I mean, I can't see anything.
-[loud shriek]

149
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,626
-My God. Jeez, that scared me.
-Oh, my God.

150
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,503
-That scared the crap out of me.
-Hang on.

151
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:20,296
-[Han-na] What's that?
-[Car] Linking arms?

152
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:23,007
-[Min-hong] That scared me so much. Jeez.
-Hang on. Oh, my…

153
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,593
[shuddering] Oh… Oh, holy hell.

154
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:27,720
[deep, eerie groaning]

155
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:30,932
-God, that startled me.
-Oh, my gosh. They're holding hands!

156
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:33,684
-[Car] They're just holding hands.
-[Eun-ji and Han-na exclaim]

157
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:37,772
At some point, I realized
we were holding hands. I was satisfied.

158
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:39,357
[cheerful music continues]

159
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,277
-[Car] She was very satisfied.
-[Han-na] Such a perfect date.

160
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:45,321
[music fades]

161
00:06:45,404 --> 00:06:47,657
Did she hold my wrist? Or my hand?

162
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:51,577
But I was only thinking about
getting out of there as fast as I could,

163
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:54,038
so I can't really remember
where she grabbed me.

164
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:56,207
I didn't really think that much about it,

165
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:59,043
and I doubt it meant much to her either.

166
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:01,045
That's what I think.

167
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,756
-You're way off.
-[Eun-ji] That's incorrect.

168
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,634
-You just set a lady's heart on fire.
-[Han-na laughs]

169
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:08,845
[eerie groaning]

170
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,763
-[Jeong-mok] Oh.
-[gasps]

171
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:11,931
So sweaty.

172
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:13,558
It's okay.

173
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:15,393
-[exclaims]
-Wow.

174
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:16,394
[upbeat music playing]

175
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:17,937
[Jeong-mok] It's so hot, isn't it?

176
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,898
-[Min-hong] Aren't you thirsty?
-Let's get a drink.

177
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:24,026
Okay. I'm dying to hear
what they'll talk about now.

178
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,612
They could find out
how they feel about each other right now.

179
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:29,323
-[Jeong-mok] Let's eat.
-[Min-hong] Thank you for the food.

180
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,159
[Jeong-mok] Thank you for the food.

181
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:32,118
[music fades]

182
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,582
[Han-na] They need a lot of water.

183
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:39,167
-Eat up.
-Go ahead.

184
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,461
Elders first.

185
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:44,464
-[Han-na] "Elders first"?
-What? Oh, respecting your elders?

186
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:45,965
The older one eats first.

187
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:48,342
You're seriously so annoying.

188
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:49,802
[mellow music playing]

189
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,387
But what if you're not older?

190
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,515
If I'm not older?
Then you should just apologize.

191
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:56,642
Okay, I apologize

192
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:00,980
Jeong-mok is suddenly
being pouty because he feels shy.

193
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:02,482
-[In-guk] He totally is.
-Right?

194
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,775
I hate guys that get pouty
when they're shy.

195
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:06,444
[Car and Eun-ji laugh]

196
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:07,987
Wait, are you traumatized?

197
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:09,906
[In-guk] I think you are.

198
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:12,575
[Car] Why are you suddenly
getting so mad about that?

199
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:15,953
-That came out of nowhere.
-Were you reminded of someone just now?

200
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,247
Whatever! I wanna yell at him…
or kill him!

201
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:21,501
-"Yell at him."
-You're suddenly throwing a fit in here.

202
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,711
[Han-na] "Being pouty when he feels shy."

203
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:25,588
-[laughs]
-[Han-na exclaims]

204
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:28,090
-[slurps]
-[mellow music playing]

205
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:33,221
-Oh, I brought my glasses too.
-What?

206
00:08:33,304 --> 00:08:35,556
-I brought my glasses too.
-Oh, really? Where?

207
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,682
You wanna see them?

208
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:39,310
[Han-na] Oh, I think
she brought matching items.

209
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:40,520
[Eun-ji] You're right.

210
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:41,646
They're similar.

211
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:42,647
[Jeong-mok] Hmm.

212
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,399
Should I wear my glasses or not?

213
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:46,651
-Wear them.
-Okay.

214
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,947
[Eun-ji gasps] So cute. Matching glasses!

215
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:52,114
[Han-na] Earlier…

216
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:56,786
-Oh, seriously?
-How do they look? Good?

217
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,829
-[In-guk] That's cute.
-[Car] She looks adorable.

218
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:00,456
-[Han-na] What is this?
-[chuckles]

219
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,167
-[Min-hong] Do I look okay?
-Yeah, it looks okay.

220
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,752
You have to tell me the truth.

221
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:06,170
[playful music playing]

222
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,297
I feel like I've seen you somewhere…

223
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:12,301
What do you think?

224
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,553
-What?
-You like them?

225
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:16,013
I look cute.

226
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,682
You're right, you're cute.

227
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:19,725
[chuckles] Oh, what? Why?

228
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:20,935
-No?
-It's good.

229
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,360
Looks pretty.

230
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,697
-[Min-hong] Wow. Yeah.
-Can you see the sea from here?

231
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:34,991
[Jeong-mok] Let's check it out.

232
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:35,950
[Min-hong] Wow.

233
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:38,286
[enchanting music playing]

234
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,246
Wow, I should take a picture of this.

235
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:42,790
-Go ahead. I'll hold that for you.
-Oh, thank you.

236
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,126
Holding her purse? He's so smooth.

237
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:47,336
Yeah, Jeong-mok is so good at that.

238
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,547
[Car] They look good together, don't they?

239
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:55,219
-[gasps] The sky!
-[camera shutter clicks]

240
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:57,597
-[camera shutter clicks]
-Wow, so pretty.

241
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,181
[Jeong-mok] Take it! Take it!

242
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:01,434
Wow.

243
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:03,311
Wow.

244
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:04,353
[music fades]

245
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,646
Hey, uh, watch out.

246
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,315
[In-guk] Right, look after her.

247
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,360
Oh, don't… You shouldn't go that way.

248
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:12,528
[enchanting music playing]

249
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:14,280
-Thanks.
-[Cupids exclaiming]

250
00:10:14,363 --> 00:10:15,990
Oh, my goodness, kids.

251
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:18,242
[Han-na] What? They're actually on a date.

252
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:21,078
What is this?
Things feel different with these two.

253
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:24,957
[Min-hong] It was nice.

254
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:31,005
Actually, I was never interested
in younger guys before coming here.

255
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:34,091
They just didn't exist in my world.

256
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:35,551
[inhales]

257
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,638
But things have changed now.

258
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,931
MIN-HONG IS 2 YEARS OLDER

259
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:43,684
I think being able to communicate well

260
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:46,520
is more important to me than age.

261
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:52,360
I guess I liked how we could talk about
this and that and anything.

262
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:57,782
And then it felt nice to flirt
without even meaning to.

263
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:01,035
-[In-guk] She did flirt a lot.
-[Han-na] Right.

264
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:03,037
ON THEIR WAY HOME FROM THE DATE

265
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,705
What's your ideal type?

266
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:05,706
-My type?
-Yeah.

267
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:07,958
Someone who looks kind.

268
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:11,212
-[Min-hong] Hmm.
-Someone with a pretty smile.

269
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:12,380
[Eun-ji] Oh, wow!

270
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:13,297
[Min-hong] Mm.

271
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,091
-[Eun-ji] Oh, my gosh!
-That's all.

272
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,425
[chuckling] No, no.

273
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:19,136
I think it was my first time.

274
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,515
I did everything I wanted to do today.

275
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:27,978
Actually, I hope Jeong-mok
goes on a date with someone else.

276
00:11:28,729 --> 00:11:31,190
I want him to be able to compare

277
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:34,527
and see that the date he had with me
was more fun

278
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,613
than anything he could do
with another girl.

279
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:40,116
Wow, I love this kind of confidence.

280
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:41,534
That's so impressive.

281
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:43,577
Honestly speaking,

282
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,329
I don't think our conversations

283
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:48,833
made me feel
really interested in her romantically,

284
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,793
but most of the time,

285
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:53,921
it felt like talking
to a close older friend.

286
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:58,134
Maybe it's because I have
Do in my mind as my top choice,

287
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:01,804
so I don't think of her
in that way exactly.

288
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:03,264
[mellow music playing]

289
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:04,849
Min-hong seems to be…

290
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:07,184
Yeah, I think she's interested in me.

291
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:08,185
Which is nice.

292
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:14,108
I guess I'm going back and forth between
someone I like and someone who likes me.

293
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:19,738
I want to go for someone I like.

294
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:20,823
[Han-na] Ugh.

295
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,199
Seriously, Jeong-mok.

296
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,869
He should open his heart a little.
By the way,

297
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:27,079
I didn't think
that Min-hong, of all people,

298
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,331
would fall in love so quickly like this.

299
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,542
-Min-hong dislikes a lot of things.
-Right.

300
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,669
Like how someone walks,
how they use chopsticks…

301
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:36,881
A lot of things she doesn't like, but now,
"Even a younger guy would be okay."

302
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:38,966
-[Eun-ji] I know.
-[Han-na] Hearing her say that

303
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:41,385
means she's totally
head over heels right now.

304
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:42,470
[Car] Totally, yeah.

305
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:45,473
Even if Jeong-mok
were to use one of those utensils

306
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:46,974
with the spoon and fork combined?

307
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:49,602
-Like in the military?
-[Eun-ji] Even if he carried that around,

308
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:51,228
-she'd be all right.
-She'd like that.

309
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:53,564
-Oh, instead of chopsticks?
-[Han-na] A spork.

310
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:55,774
-I have one at home.
-[Cupids laughing]

311
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:58,861
-She'd even be okay with that.
-[Han-na] Yeah, right? Right.

312
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:02,698
Oh, it's "Nice to meet you."

313
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:04,158
[In-guk] Yeah, but who?

314
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:08,704
-So, getting back to the cliffhanger…
-[Car] I'm so curious.

315
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:11,165
[Eun-ji] God, I'm dying to know.
Please show us quickly.

316
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,291
-[Sang-ho] Hi.
-[woman] Oh.

317
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:13,959
[in Japanese] Hello. [chuckles]

318
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,086
Hello. [chuckles]

319
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:19,757
[whimsical music playing]

320
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:26,680
[Han-na in English]
He was really taken aback.

321
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,974
-[woman in Japanese] Hello.
-[in English] Hi.

322
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,643
[in Japanese] Nice to meet you.

323
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,771
-[in English] Nice to meet you.
-[Eun-ji] "Nice to meet you."

324
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:36,273
-[Cupids laugh and exclaim]
-[chuckles softly]

325
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,733
[Car] Oh, this is someone new.

326
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:41,237
I opened the door and went in, but then
she suddenly spoke Japanese to me,

327
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,739
so I was really surprised,
and even her appearance…

328
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:45,241
She kind of looked Japanese.

329
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:47,785
So I was thinking,
"Does she not speak Korean?"

330
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:50,162
It's hard enough
talking to women in Korean,

331
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:51,956
but if she speaks Japanese…

332
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:54,416
I kind of wanted to
just go home. [chuckles]

333
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:58,963
[in Japanese] Can you speak Japanese?

334
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,966
[in English] Uh, oh, I… I'm Korean, so…

335
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:04,802
-Ah.
-[Han-na] She doesn't speak Korean?

336
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:08,347
[laughs] I'm sorry,
I was trying to break the ice,

337
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:10,891
-so I thought I'd say "hi" in Japanese.
-Oh. Oh.

338
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,017
-What?
-[Han-na] Huh?

339
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,687
Oh, she's not Japanese.

340
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,814
[whimsical music playing]

341
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:19,149
-Uh, hello. [chuckles]
-Hello.

342
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,944
Oh, are you a new participant?

343
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:25,322
-Uh, yes.
-Oh, okay.

344
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:27,241
-[Cupids exclaim]
-[Sang-ho] Okay, well, hi.

345
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:31,871
Hello, I'm Kim Mi-ji,
and I've been single for 27 years.

346
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,497
-[Han-na] Her "before" look?
-Yeah.

347
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:36,834
[Mi-ji] I'm a Japanese teacher
at a high school.

348
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:38,586
[Car] Oh, she's a teacher.

349
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:40,671
[Mi-ji] My colleagues
at the school and my students

350
00:14:40,754 --> 00:14:43,382
don't know
that I've been single since birth.

351
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:44,466
INTERVIEW WITH PRODUCERS

352
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,303
When I go to work,
I actually don't dress up like this.

353
00:14:47,386 --> 00:14:49,763
I just dress comfortably with glasses on.

354
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:53,058
My students often tell me
to do something about my glasses.

355
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,894
-[chuckles]
-[staff laughing]

356
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,270
DO YOU HAVE ANY FLIRTING SKILLS?

357
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:58,814
What's my flirting technique?
I actually binge-watched

358
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:02,026
a lot of dating shows after I applied
to be on here. [chuckles]

359
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:04,987
I watched how they flirted
on those shows and thought,

360
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,947
"I should try this when I date."

361
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:08,741
I tried to remember those.

362
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:09,783
If you choose me,

363
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:14,371
I'll learn some flirting techniques
and show you how I use them.

364
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,165
-[chuckles]
-[staff laughing]

365
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,750
WHAT FLIRTING SKILLS DID YOU PREPARE?

366
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,793
My friends said that
since men like soccer,

367
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:23,088
it would help to memorize
some soccer players' names.

368
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:24,506
MEETING HER CUPID

369
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:27,927
I might suggest playing a game
where we state soccer players' names

370
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:28,969
ending in "Ba."

371
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,722
-So, like, Drogba, Muamba, Demba Ba…
-Drogba. Muamba.

372
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:34,016
-Demba Ba.
-…Pogba. That kind of thing.

373
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,643
Wow, that's pretty bad.

374
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,269
[both laughing]

375
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,066
What I do pretty often is…

376
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:44,818
For example,
Mi-ji, you're over here. This hand…

377
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:47,738
If the person you like is next to you,
you could do this and that,

378
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:49,239
like… "What time is it?"

379
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:50,741
-"What time is it?"
-Ah.

380
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:53,452
-Did you feel that?
-Yeah.

381
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:55,371
Try that to me right now. I'm the guy.

382
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,373
-Right now?
-Yeah, I'm the guy. Like,

383
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:59,667
"I kind of want an iced Americano."

384
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:01,460
Wanna get coffee?

385
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:02,544
[giggles sheepishly]

386
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,129
[laughs hysterically]

387
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:05,798
That was great.

388
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:09,051
Your breath, timing,
the warmth of your hand…

389
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:10,803
It was great.

390
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:14,515
But, "You wanna get coffee?"
doesn't quite cut it.

391
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:16,642
If it was me, I'd do this.

392
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:18,686
"Jeez, I want an iced Americano."

393
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:19,728
I want a latte.

394
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,522
-I want a latte.
-Huh?

395
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:24,191
-[In-guk] Good job!
-Just that much. That much, you know?

396
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:26,318
-[Han-na] You're really good.
-Back in the day,

397
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:29,530
I also thought flirting
was stuff like this,

398
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:31,490
like this, and like this…

399
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,242
But it's not.

400
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:37,705
I think flirting is just showing
someone I'm interested in

401
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:39,915
what kind of charm I have.

402
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,334
-Oh, she's writing it down.
-[Han-na] She's taking notes.

403
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:44,670
Mi-ji was very eager to learn.

404
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:45,754
[charming music playing]

405
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:50,467
I applied because I wanted to try dating
before I turned 30.

406
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:54,138
So, if someone I'm interested in
is in front of me,

407
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:58,767
I think I'll try hard
to express my feelings honestly

408
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,144
and smile a lot.

409
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:01,687
[chuckles]

410
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:03,480
[Eun-ji] Oh, Mi-ji. You look so pretty.

411
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:04,982
KIM MI-JI
BOOK-LEARNED DATING NOVICE

412
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:06,108
She's charming, isn't she?

413
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:07,484
-[Car] Lovely.
-Very charming.

414
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,528
I think it's great
she got rid of her glasses.

415
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:11,238
-Her glasses are like, you know…
-Right.

416
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:12,156
[Han-na] Yes.

417
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:13,615
…with the really thick lenses…

418
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,659
-A funny costume.
-They make her eyes look small.

419
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,995
[Han-na] She has
really big eyes without her glasses.

420
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:21,165
-Oh, you do have teacher vibes.
-Japan… Oh, really?

421
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:26,378
I spoke Japanese earlier to break the ice,
but you looked so tense.

422
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,630
I didn't hear anything
about you, actually,

423
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,508
but since you were speaking Japanese…

424
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,343
Ah. [laughs]

425
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:37,222
It was funny, but I was surprised, too.

426
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:40,142
Well, maybe I did feel
a little sad and left out,

427
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:43,020
but then I felt much better. Yeah.

428
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:44,313
It was nice.

429
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:46,023
Where are you from?

430
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:47,733
Oh, where do you think?

431
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,027
Gyeongsang?

432
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:53,530
Yeah, that's right.
Oh, could you tell from my accent?

433
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:56,075
Well, I'm from Gyeongsang Province too.

434
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:56,992
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

435
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:59,536
-Where in Gyeongsang Province do you live?
-I'm from Gumi.

436
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,497
-Gumi. Oh, I see.
-Daegu, Gumi, near there.

437
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,208
-I'm from… Have you heard of Changnyeong?
-I know Changnyeong.

438
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:06,043
-Oh, do you?
-Yeah, I've been there once.

439
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:07,086
-Oh, really?
-Right.

440
00:18:07,169 --> 00:18:08,462
I'm from Changnyeong.

441
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:09,546
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

442
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,673
-[charming music playing]
-[both chuckle]

443
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:13,467
Oh.

444
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,886
-I feel more at ease meeting people…
-Yes.

445
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:17,596
-…from outside Seoul.
-Right?

446
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:18,806
I actually do too.

447
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:21,141
Meeting someone from outside Seoul
makes me feel relaxed.

448
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:23,936
And for a couple,
it'd be hard to live too far apart.

449
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,896
I guess it wouldn't matter
if you like someone.

450
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:28,857
-You do have to consider the distance.
-Yeah, realistically.

451
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,151
-[Eun-ji] He's a strategist.
-[Han-na] Thinking ahead.

452
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:33,320
He's thinking about
when they become a couple later.

453
00:18:33,403 --> 00:18:35,948
Right now, Kim Sang-ho
is already dating in his mind.

454
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:37,616
[laughs]

455
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:39,118
[Mi-ji] We're the same age.

456
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:40,828
-So, we can be casual.
-[Sang-ho] Really?

457
00:18:40,911 --> 00:18:43,622
-[Mi-ji] No formalities
-[Sang-ho] Oh, yeah. Okay.

458
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:44,748
[music fades]

459
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:47,626
-I think you'll be popular.
-Really?

460
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:48,669
You look

461
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:50,754
-like a Japanese celeb.
-Oh, really?

462
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:53,841
No, really. Like,
when I watch YouTube videos…

463
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:56,885
You can watch Japanese shows,
translated into Korean.

464
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,805
And right now, it's like
I'm watching one of these shows,

465
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:02,182
-like when the camera cuts to an actress…
-Wow.

466
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,684
-…with great reactions, like…
-What?

467
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:05,269
-Like a Japanese actress.
-An actress?

468
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:07,813
-Like a Japanese celebrity.
-An actress with good reactions?

469
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:09,606
-You seem so cheerful.
-Really?

470
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:10,816
[Mi-ji] Mmm.

471
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:12,943
[quirky music playing]

472
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:15,904
-Wow, since when does he give compliments?
-[Car] I know, right?

473
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:19,700
-So different from when he was with Ji-su.
-He must've felt comfortable.

474
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:23,120
-[Sang-ho] Close to my ideal type.
-[Han-na] Oh, she's his type?

475
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:24,496
Yeah, she's pretty close.

476
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,873
-[gasps]
-[Cupids exclaim]

477
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:28,500
Oh, she was his type.
She was Sang-ho's type.

478
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:32,588
She seems outgoing,
and she really listened and related to me.

479
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:35,674
And, like, the combination of…
living close to me

480
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:39,052
and having a country vibe,
but looking kind of foreign.

481
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:41,263
I thought she was more interesting.

482
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,891
[In-guk] He must've fallen for her.

483
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:46,852
So, are you glad you came on this date?

484
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:49,438
Yeah, it was worth not getting picked.

485
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:52,649
It just seems like you
hesitated a bit just now.

486
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,735
-I didn't hesitate.
-[chuckles]

487
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:56,528
-[pleasant music playing]
-Hmm.

488
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:57,863
Honestly, I was curious.

489
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:01,909
Today, I feel rather lucky,
not to have been picked.

490
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,285
-Really?
-Lucky.

491
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,162
Really? Wow!

492
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:06,163
I was touched.

493
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:07,998
That's awesome. Me too.

494
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:11,752
I think I felt pretty relaxed
during the date.

495
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:16,089
We started out with how we both
came from Gyeongsang Province,

496
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:20,260
so the conversation felt easy,
like I could rely on him.

497
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:21,678
[pleasant music continues]

498
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:22,846
[inaudible]

499
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,473
[Sang-ho] My current top choice is…

500
00:20:25,182 --> 00:20:26,475
It seems a little too…

501
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,477
Like I fell for someone too quickly,

502
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,145
but I think it's Mi-ji.

503
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,521
[Han-na exclaims]

504
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:34,775
If I could choose,
I think I'd go on a date with Mi-ji.

505
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:36,026
[inaudible]

506
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:39,905
[Han-na] Wow, he's totally smitten.

507
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:41,156
Oh.

508
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,784
But even when Ji-su
expressed herself so honestly,

509
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:45,619
-Sang-ho didn't give much feedback…
-Yes.

510
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:47,537
-…just mumbled his responses.
-So frustrating.

511
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,206
He never even spoke clearly.

512
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:51,833
How can he suddenly say
that Mi-ji is his top choice?

513
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,669
I think for Sang-ho,

514
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:56,713
Mi-ji is someone
he can talk to comfortably.

515
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:59,007
-I guess he felt at ease enough…
-I think so.

516
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,759
…that he could actually develop

517
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:03,095
-some feelings for her.
-[Eun-ji] Yeah.

518
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:05,013
So, Sang-ho's type must be someone

519
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:07,808
-who slowly eases her way into his heart.
-Makes sense.

520
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:08,725
You're right.

521
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:12,187
He likes something that feels natural.
I think that's the way he is.

522
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:15,148
But don't you think our show,
and the whole universe,

523
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:18,402
-maybe is oddly going in favor of Sang-ho?
-Right?

524
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:22,447
-He's just sitting there doing nothing.
-Yeah, we even gave him free time alone.

525
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:23,365
I know.

526
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:25,951
ONE-ON-ONE DATE
JI-YEON & JAE-YUN

527
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:27,619
[Han-na] Ji-yeon and Jae-yun…

528
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,329
How will their date go?

529
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:30,998
[Car] Oh, I'm really curious.

530
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,624
[Ji-yeon] But the weather was…

531
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,002
It was raining, but it cleared up.

532
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:36,920
That's nice, huh?

533
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:39,047
[pleasant music playing]

534
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:42,426
[Ji-yeon] I was so nervous. I was like,

535
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:44,344
"Oh, God. What do I do?"

536
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:46,555
But in the end, it turned out great.

537
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:48,724
Yeah, it was nice.

538
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,892
Ji-yeon really likes Jae-yun.

539
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,770
I know. Ji-yeon is finally going
on a one-on-one date.

540
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:58,608
[Ji-yeon] Wow, I've never seen
pink muhly before! Have you ever seen it?

541
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,694
[Jae-yun] I've never even
heard of it until now.

542
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:01,862
[Ji-yeon] Oh, really?

543
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:04,698
Oh, they should take
some pictures together.

544
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:07,784
[Ji-yeon] Wow. Oh, let's take
some selfies to show everyone.

545
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:09,661
[Jae-yun] Oh, selfies?

546
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,371
-Selfies are nice.
-[Han-na] Yes.

547
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,290
-[Ji-yeon] Go like this…
-[Eun-ji] Nice. Nice.

548
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:15,250
[cheerful music playing]

549
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,377
-No, let's take them together.
-Oh, okay.

550
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:18,587
-Sorry.
-[Eun-ji] So cute.

551
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,922
[Han-na] He was gonna
take a selfie of just Ji-yeon?

552
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:21,965
[camera shutter clicks]

553
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:24,801
-[Eun-ji] Whoa, that's scary.
-[Han-na] Jae-yun, smile.

554
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:27,012
[In-guk] Oh, my God.
At least he's doing something.

555
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:30,307
-[camera shutter clicking]
-[Eun-ji] Oh, my dear Ji-yeon!

556
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:32,809
[music fades]

557
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:35,437
[Ji-yeon] Don't you think
small flowers like these are prettier?

558
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,689
-[Jae-yun] Yeah, violets are pretty too.
-Are they?

559
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:39,441
[Jae-yun] Oh, you could make jewelry.

560
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:41,985
[Ji-yeon] Yeah.
I could make a bracelet or a ring.

561
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:43,236
I'll make you one.

562
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,280
[charming music playing]

563
00:22:45,363 --> 00:22:46,239
[Han-na] Ji-yeon.

564
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:47,824
-[Ji-yeon] There.
-Oh, hey!

565
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:49,367
[Han-na] On his pinky.

566
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,620
Good job, Ji-yeon.

567
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:53,747
That took so much courage from her.

568
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,959
One, two, three.

569
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,211
[camera shutter clicks]

570
00:22:59,294 --> 00:23:02,005
[Eun-ji] Oh, I like how his hand
is so much bigger than hers.

571
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:08,762
[Ji-yeon] Should we go over there?
I think I wore the wrong pants today.

572
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:10,347
Oh, scary.

573
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,932
-Oh, need a hand?
-Oh, no.

574
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:15,143
[Eun-ji] Hey, good job, Jae-yun!

575
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,395
[Ji-yeon] It…
It's better to walk sideways.

576
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:19,773
It's a bit better this way. Let's go.

577
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:21,858
[pleasant music playing]

578
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:26,363
When we went roller skating,
Jae-yun didn't show any interest.

579
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:30,659
But he gave me a hand
and was considerate of me today.

580
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,077
Seeing that made me think,

581
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,955
"He's really putting in an effort."

582
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:36,123
I liked that.

583
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:38,875
-Thank you for the food.
-Thank you for the food.

584
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,087
[Ji-yeon] It's good.

585
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:45,674
Oh, I'm curious about something.

586
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:48,176
How old do you think the other women are?

587
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,261
-How old?
-Yeah.

588
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:50,762
First of all…

589
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:53,306
-Can you tell?
-Hmm?

590
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,977
Am I the same age, or younger,
or older? [chuckles]

591
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,189
Well…

592
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,568
I think you're barely 20.

593
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:05,652
Me?

594
00:24:05,735 --> 00:24:07,320
You're pretty good. [chuckles]

595
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:09,114
-[Jae-yun] Actually…
-Pretty good.

596
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:11,700
-[Eun-ji] That must've been a joke.
-[Han-na] It was a joke.

597
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,535
[playful music playing]

598
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:16,329
-[Car] These two look so cute together.
-[Eun-ji] Yeah.

599
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:21,126
You're smiling. [chuckles]

600
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:24,087
Well, I think it's polite
to make eye contact.

601
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:25,881
But you can't?

602
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:28,508
I don't want it to seem like
I'm staring at you.

603
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:30,010
Oh, really? You can stare.

604
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:31,678
[chuckling]

605
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:33,471
[In-guk] Why are they so cute together?

606
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:35,432
[Car] They make a nice couple.

607
00:24:35,515 --> 00:24:36,516
BEFORE THE MAKEOVER

608
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:39,603
Making eye contact is kind of hard.

609
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:44,274
I think I have a habit of,
like, looking down.

610
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:46,276
[quirky music playing]

611
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:47,819
[In-guk] That used to be him.

612
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:50,155
This is taking so much courage for him.

613
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:51,698
[Ji-yeon] And,

614
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:53,116
like,

615
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:56,203
I don't think
you have to be so careful either.

616
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:57,204
Hmm.

617
00:24:58,538 --> 00:24:59,456
I guess…

618
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:03,460
I try not to talk
so I don't cause any trouble.

619
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:04,377
[Ji-yeon] Hmm.

620
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:07,214
Like, in case I make a mistake.

621
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:09,007
But who doesn't make mistakes?

622
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,550
Hmm. That--

623
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:13,303
If you make a mistake, just say,

624
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:15,180
"Sorry, shouldn't have said that,"

625
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:16,890
and move on.

626
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:20,518
And I don't think people will think
you're rude for doing that.

627
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:23,230
I don't think you have to
keep thinking about things like,

628
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:25,398
"Did I say the wrong thing earlier?"

629
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:28,818
Isn't it hard
to keep thinking about that all day?

630
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,820
Actually, I used to be like that too.

631
00:25:30,904 --> 00:25:31,947
Right, right.

632
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,657
I was kind of the same way…

633
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:38,662
How should I say this? It feels like…

634
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:41,414
Like I was looking at myself.

635
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,293
I just thought,
"Oh, he must be thinking about that."

636
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:49,214
I could feel that on the inside,
so I just thought,

637
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:51,216
"It might be nice to tell him this."

638
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:52,968
[solemn music playing]

639
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:54,052
[Han-na sighs]

640
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:01,434
[Ji-yeon] When I first saw him, I thought,

641
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:03,895
"Oh, there's someone else like me here."

642
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,397
That was my reaction.

643
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:10,986
He was all fidgety
and kept reading people's reactions.

644
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:14,072
I had heard something like this
from someone,

645
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:17,284
and I think I've gotten better now.

646
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:20,662
So, I really wanted to tell
Jae-yun this too.

647
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,666
That was a big, big help.

648
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,501
Oh, really? I'm glad.

649
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:31,214
[Jae-yun] We have a lot in common,
and we connected on many levels.

650
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:34,509
It was easy to talk to her
about everyone, so I was happy.

651
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:36,678
Oh, that warms my heart.

652
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:39,514
-[Han-na] That's so kind of her.
-Yeah, she has a kind heart, really.

653
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:41,308
She's been through the same thing,

654
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:43,560
so she can see
the other person's struggles.

655
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:44,894
She can relate to him.

656
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:47,814
You know what I mean?
She's like, "I've been in pain before,

657
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:50,233
so I can see he's feeling that right now."

658
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:53,361
[Ji-yeon] You changed your mind?

659
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:56,031
Yeah, so… for the first impression pick,

660
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:58,575
-I considered two people.
-Considering one or the other? Yeah.

661
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:03,413
But now, my top choice isn't
who I chose then. It's the other person.

662
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:05,040
[Ji-yeon] Mmm.

663
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,209
Mine's stayed the same.

664
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:11,296
[Han-na] It's been Jae-yun the whole time.

665
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,257
Oh, she said it herself,
but she's getting nervous.

666
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:15,383
[Han-na] Oh, my God!

667
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,510
[charming music playing]

668
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:24,142
But like… So, now, when that person goes
on a one-on-one date with someone else,

669
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:27,729
or I see that their dynamic has changed,

670
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:31,566
I might feel some heartache,

671
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:34,736
because I haven't been interested
in anyone else.

672
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:37,447
There isn't anyone else for me.

673
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,162
I'll just go for it. [chuckles]

674
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:47,332
-[gasps] "I'll just go for it."
-That's so cool that she said that.

675
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:48,249
That's awesome.

676
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,210
-[Han-na] I love that.
-But did Jae-yun get it?

677
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:52,879
-I think Jae-yun understood her.
-[In-guk] I'm sure he got it.

678
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:54,422
[charming music continues]

679
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:03,973
That was really the best date
that I've had so far.

680
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:07,811
I think my interest in him
has gone up a lot more.

681
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:13,691
[music fades]

682
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:16,820
Before that,
I felt that we had a nice conversation,

683
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:18,947
not because of romantic attraction, but…

684
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:21,741
because she's just…

685
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,535
good.

686
00:28:24,702 --> 00:28:25,829
But after that,

687
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:30,291
I wondered if I might've mistaken this
for a mutual attraction.

688
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:33,878
I suddenly had mixed feelings,

689
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:36,798
and I felt bad for her.

690
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:40,385
I think that was because
what my heart wants…

691
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:42,762
isn't Ji-yeon.

692
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:44,889
Ah.

693
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:46,349
[inhales sharply]

694
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:48,184
-Jeez. [clicks tongue]
-[Eun-ji] Mmm.

695
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:49,936
She just said that she was going for it.

696
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:51,980
She said, "I'll just go for it."

697
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:54,858
I was wondering if Jae-yun
might have a change of heart,

698
00:28:54,941 --> 00:28:55,942
but I don't think he did.

699
00:28:56,025 --> 00:28:57,694
This is really sad, in a way.

700
00:28:57,777 --> 00:28:58,820
[inhales sharply]

701
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:00,113
[light music playing]

702
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:02,157
[Eun-ji] They're back
from their dates now.

703
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,283
NOH JAE-YUN
HA JEONG-MOK

704
00:29:03,366 --> 00:29:06,161
-[Jeong-mok] Jae-yun, you here?
-Yeah, I'm getting changed.

705
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:08,997
Oh, I should tell you
before I forget, right?

706
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:09,914
About what?

707
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:11,916
Ji-yeon's roommate is that person.

708
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,001
[Jeong-mok] Ji-yeon?

709
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:14,794
-Oh, you mean Do? Yeah.
-It's Do.

710
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:16,921
So, I asked her…

711
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:17,839
Did you ask?

712
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:19,549
-Yeah.
-No, you can't.

713
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:20,884
[Han-na] Ah, how does Do feel?

714
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:22,719
Oh, was it too obvious?

715
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:25,472
-[Jeong-mok] Yes, and?
-Well, anyway, I asked.

716
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:27,974
Isn't she interested in Seung-li?

717
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:29,350
I could totally see it.

718
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:32,729
But anyway, well,
after hearing her reasons,

719
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:35,148
I understood why she chose Seung-li.

720
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:38,443
-I guess I could understand.
-Really?

721
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:39,944
-What reasons?
-[Eun-ji] Why?

722
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:42,739
There were reasons?
Didn't they just pick in order?

723
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:44,991
I heard something from Ji-yeon.

724
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:49,037
I asked what type of guy
her roommate likes.

725
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,205
Right.

726
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:51,664
Someone manly.

727
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:52,707
So…

728
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:55,835
-No, not manly in a physical way.
-That's not me.

729
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,045
-Like how you act.
-Really?

730
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:59,380
I guess she likes someone who acts manly.

731
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:00,632
Yeah, yeah.

732
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:03,134
Someone who isn't so calculating

733
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:06,429
and is just direct, like a manly man.

734
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:07,347
[Jeong-mok] Hmm.

735
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:10,892
Just expressing himself
when he should, like that?

736
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:12,769
[Jeong-mok] Okay.

737
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:14,395
But still, Jae-yun's got some good…

738
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:16,815
-He gave him some intel.
-Good information from somewhere.

739
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:19,442
-[up-tempo jazzy music playing]
-[Jeong-mok sighs]

740
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:21,653
[Jae-yun] Will you…
Will you write a letter today?

741
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:23,112
[Jeong-mok] I should, yeah.

742
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:25,824
I thought that at this point,

743
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,992
I should find a reason to talk to her,

744
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:30,245
since I'm not getting a chance
to do so now.

745
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:31,496
[In-guk] Gotta make a move.

746
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:33,373
Oh, what should I write?

747
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:34,916
Oh, we should write them now.

748
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:35,834
What should I write?

749
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:39,087
Be direct and confident. Call her by name.

750
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:42,340
I'll just say, "I want to go on a date
with you tomorrow, Do."

751
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:43,341
Can I say that?

752
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:45,510
But since Do likes manly guys,

753
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:47,887
asking her out on a date
wouldn't be too bad.

754
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,848
-"I wanna spend time with you."
-Yeah.

755
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,808
-Be more forward.
-I want to spend time…

756
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:54,269
-He's not in a position to give advice.
-I know.

757
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:56,479
-Jae-yun, what are you talking about?
-[Eun-ji laughs]

758
00:30:58,231 --> 00:30:59,315
A MESSAGE HAS ARRIVED

759
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:00,525
[Jae-yun] We gotta go?

760
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:02,068
Hang on.

761
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:02,986
No, not yet.

762
00:31:03,069 --> 00:31:04,779
[Ji-yeon] We should go pick out seats.

763
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,239
Oh, the seats.

764
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:08,032
[Car] The Eternal Singles' Night
has begun.

765
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,909
"Please gather in the Event Zone."

766
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:12,245
[low gripping music playing]

767
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,665
[Yeo-myung] I wanted to sit
next to Jeong-mok.

768
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:17,333
[Car] It's a mind game now.

769
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:20,378
[Yeo-myung] I usually like
sitting across from the person I like,

770
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:23,298
but I want to sit next to him
and talk to him more.

771
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:25,675
Since he said he likes sitting
next to someone he likes.

772
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:26,801
[Han-na] Right. Right.

773
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:28,219
Just go and sit down.

774
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:30,555
Nice, nice.

775
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:33,308
[Yeo-myung] But I arrived before he did.

776
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:35,226
[gripping music continues]

777
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:38,938
I forgot that we can't pick our spots
if we show up late.

778
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:41,691
[Jeong-mok] Hurry up.
The seat next to Yeo-myung is open, look.

779
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:54,704
[Car] She moved aside a little.

780
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:56,915
-[Han-na] Yes, good.
-[Car] Oh, she moved.

781
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,501
[In-guk] Oh, but this is…

782
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:01,753
[Han-na and Eun-ji exclaim]

783
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:03,296
[Eun-ji] They sat like that.

784
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:04,672
[music fades]

785
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,132
Hey, where's Sang-ho?

786
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:07,926
[indistinct chatter]

787
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,386
[Jeong-mok] I guess he's not here.

788
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,430
[solemn music playing]

789
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:14,098
-Is someone still not here? No?
-Yeah.

790
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:16,643
[Ji-su] They could sit there.
It's empty over there.

791
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:19,354
THE SEAT NEXT TO JEONG-MOK IS STILL EMPTY

792
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:24,025
[Yeo-myung] The seat
next to him was empty,

793
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:25,735
but that was the center seat.

794
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:28,279
And we had to keep that open
for the new person.

795
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,490
I couldn't have her sit at the end.

796
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:33,284
So, I had no choice but to stay here.

797
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,746
[Eun-ji] Oh, Yeo-myung
keeps missing her chance.

798
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:41,709
Hey, something smells nice.
I think someone is wearing cologne.

799
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,711
[Hyun-kyu] Is someone wearing cologne?

800
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:45,755
-Who is it?
-Oh, yes, yes. He is.

801
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:46,881
[Seung-chan] It's Jae-yun.

802
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,716
[Hyun-kyu] I could smell it
from over there.

803
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,593
-[Ji-yeon] No.
-Did I use too much?

804
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:52,470
-[Hyun-kyu] I could smell it.
-Not too much.

805
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:55,014
-[Hyun-kyu] You're wearing cologne for…
-What scent is that?

806
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:56,140
It's like grassy…

807
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:57,225
You could sit there.

808
00:32:57,308 --> 00:33:01,312
Kind of a grassy and… woody scent?

809
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:03,106
Like that.

810
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:05,233
Oh, does it smell bad?

811
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:07,360
[Yeo-myung] What?
No, but I… I use this scent too.

812
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:09,195
-I have it too.
-Oh, you use the same scent.

813
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:11,614
[Jeong-mok] Oh, right.
You two are perfect for each other.

814
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:13,616
[Han-na] Hey, he's happy.

815
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,201
[Jae-yun] I have this fragrance.

816
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:17,954
And it was kind of similar
to the scent that Yeo-myung likes.

817
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:21,290
The fragrance I use
has a similar grassy smell.

818
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:24,085
-She said she uses the same scent.
-Oh, I see.

819
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,420
[mellow music playing]

820
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:26,546
[spraying]

821
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:29,757
Should I spray some more?

822
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,926
Can you smell it?
Maybe I should put on more.

823
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,262
-[Jeong-mok] Slather it on.
-Okay.

824
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:37,682
-[Jeong-mok] That much is hard to miss.
-Right?

825
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:38,725
[Jeong-mok] Good.

826
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:41,519
Yeo-myung said that
she also had a perfume like that,

827
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:43,521
so I was surprised.

828
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:47,817
[indistinct chatter]

829
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:49,402
[music fades]

830
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:52,030
Does anyone need a straw?

831
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:54,699
-Should I get some?
-[Do] I'm gonna get some from the Lounge.

832
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:55,950
-I'll bring them.
-I need one.

833
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,036
-You shouldn't go in those shoes.
-[Do] Oh, but I--

834
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,287
I'll go.

835
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:03,791
-I'll go.
-[Yeo-myung] Wait for me.

836
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:05,877
[Jeong-mok] Jae-yun.

837
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,836
Jae-yun.

838
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:09,130
[Jae-yun] Oh, right.

839
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:11,299
-[Yeo-myung] Let's go together.
-[In-guk] So obvious.

840
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:12,759
Let's go together. Come on.

841
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:16,804
[moody music playing]

842
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:22,685
Jeong-mok got up
and went to get some stuff we needed.

843
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:24,604
So, I got up and said I'd come too.

844
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:26,606
But he suddenly sat back down

845
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:28,274
and told Jae-yun to go instead,

846
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:30,735
-like, "Jae-yun, you should go."
-[Han-na sighs]

847
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:32,570
So, the two of us went instead.

848
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:35,114
Yeah, I've been rejected so many times.

849
00:34:35,823 --> 00:34:39,118
But my guess is that,
since they're roommates,

850
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:41,412
Jae-yun said he was interested in me,

851
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:45,166
and Jeong-mok must've said
he liked someone else,

852
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:48,461
so they could be
trying to help each other out.

853
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:50,421
That's what I figured.

854
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:51,964
[Han-na] She sensed that.

855
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,716
[Car] Right, it's pretty obvious.

856
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,638
God, that was way too obvious.

857
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:00,389
They should've all gone together.

858
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:02,642
-But right then, to Jae-yun…
-Oh, my God.

859
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:04,894
That'll only
hurt her feelings more, right?

860
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:06,062
[Han-na sighs]

861
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:07,814
[Ji-yeon] Eternal Singles' Night.

862
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:09,148
Eternal Singles' Night.

863
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:10,608
[all] Cheers!

864
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:12,443
[pleasant music playing]

865
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:16,114
[indistinct chatter, laughter]

866
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:18,616
[In-guk] I guess
they're just getting back from their date.

867
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:20,785
[music fades]

868
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:22,829
-Didn't you hear a car?
-[Ji-su] Oh?

869
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:23,830
[contestants exclaim]

870
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:25,123
[Ji-su] Oh, wow! [gasps]

871
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:27,125
[soft charming music playing]

872
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:29,710
-I can see her. Oh, my God.
-[Jeong-mok] I saw her.

873
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,923
-[Ji-su] Welcome.
-[contestants greeting]

874
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:35,675
This is our new member.

875
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,344
[in Japanese] Good evening.
Nice to meet you.

876
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:40,596
[Seung-chan in English] Go this way.
It's narrow here.

877
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,806
[Ji-su] It's too narrow.

878
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:43,599
-[Seung-chan] This is…
-[Do] Wow.

879
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:46,644
-[Mi-ji in Japanese] Good evening.
-[Seung-chan in English] Come this way.

880
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:48,729
-[Min-hong] She's Japanese.
-[Seung-chan] No.

881
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:51,524
-She just said "good evening" in Japanese.
-[Seung-li] Really?

882
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:53,776
[Jeong-mok] I thought
she was really Japanese.

883
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,529
-So, I was like, "What do we do?"
-[Seung-li] Really?

884
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:57,530
-Hey!
-[all] Hello!

885
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:58,865
-Hello.
-[Mi-ji] Oh.

886
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:01,534
-[in Japanese] Please introduce yourself.
-[Cupids laughing]

887
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:04,036
-[in English] Hello, I'm not Japanese.
-[Do] Hello.

888
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,414
My name's Kim Mi-ji,
and I'm the new eternal single.

889
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:08,040
I'm excited to meet you guys.

890
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:09,584
Nice to meet you.

891
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,669
[mellow midtempo music playing]

892
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:14,922
[Jae-yun] Right away,
she seemed very kind.

893
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:17,550
[Seung-chan] I was wondering
if she had lived abroad.

894
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:19,760
[Seung-li] She looked pretty nice.

895
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:20,928
[music fades]

896
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:23,514
-[Mi-ji] Someone sitting here?
-What'll they do this time?

897
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:27,351
TONIGHT, THE WOMEN WILL REVEAL
THEIR INFORMATION

898
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:30,855
-[Han-na] They should do it now.
-Age and job. I'm curious. So curious.

899
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:32,565
-They should reveal that.
-[In-guk] Yeah.

900
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:35,193
-[Ji-yeon] The moment of truth.
-[Seung-li] I was dying to know.

901
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:37,111
[exhales softly]

902
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:41,073
I was dying to know about this.
This is great.

903
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:43,034
[Yeo-myung] The leading lady of the night?

904
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:45,161
[contestants exclaim and applaud]

905
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:48,289
-[Jeong-mok] Let's hear her story.
-[Ji-su] Right.

906
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:49,999
I was born in '98.

907
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:51,918
-[women exclaim]
-Ah.

908
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:54,962
-[Min-hong] Everyone's born in '98
-Yes, I'm a Japanese teacher.

909
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:56,589
[contestants exclaim, laugh]

910
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:57,965
That fits you. [chuckles]

911
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:00,426
[Mi-ji] You really think so? Thanks.

912
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,721
-Go on, pick someone.
-[Hyun-kyu] Choose.

913
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:05,473
-Choose someone?
-[Mi-ji] Kang Ji-su.

914
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:07,767
What year do you think I was born?

915
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:09,518
KANG HYUN-KYU, AGE 26

916
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:11,646
I just think you're older than me.

917
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:14,982
-So, like, 28 years old?
-[Seung-chan] You think she's older.

918
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,609
[Seung-chan gasps]

919
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:18,819
[Ji-su] I'm…

920
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:21,405
-26.
-[Hyun-kyu] Wait, really?

921
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:22,698
SHE'S THE SAME AGE AS HYUN-KYU

922
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:24,909
-[Jeong-mok] Big mistake.
-[Sang-ho] What? Seriously?

923
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:26,786
But he kept saying I was older.

924
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:29,705
No, but she seemed so mature. That's why--

925
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:32,875
So, I told him, "Treat me like I'm older.
Speak formally."

926
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:35,711
-I treated her with respect. I really did.
-And he actually did that.

927
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:38,297
[Seung-chan] Oh, I guess
you really thought she was older.

928
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:39,966
-[Hyun-kyu] Yeah.
-[playful music plays]

929
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:41,509
I'm totally shocked.

930
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,803
I didn't know we were the same age.

931
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:48,849
But I've never been involved
with anyone older, so,

932
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:53,479
I guess I'm relieved
that we're the same age?

933
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:55,189
And your job?

934
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:57,358
I…

935
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:02,321
I majored in dance.

936
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:04,907
I studied ballet in particular.

937
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:06,867
-[Ji-yeon] Totally fits.
-[Min-hong] Teach me.

938
00:38:06,951 --> 00:38:07,994
[Do] Awesome.

939
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:10,955
-[Ji-yeon] Makes sense.
-[Min-hong] I wanna learn.

940
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:12,873
[upbeat music playing]

941
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:16,961
[Ji-su] I'm a ballet teacher
and I teach at a ballet studio.

942
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,880
Fold it in a bit. Keep your hips steady.

943
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:22,591
Look to your left elbow,
and lean into a cambré back.

944
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:23,592
And right back up.

945
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:28,347
I teach lessons
in the early morning and afternoon.

946
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,474
[Eun-ji] That's cool.

947
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,310
KANG JI-SU, AGE 26
BALLET INSTRUCTOR

948
00:38:32,393 --> 00:38:33,728
Ooh!

949
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:36,772
[Min-hong] Wow,
I wanna go and learn some ballet.

950
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:41,110
[Seung-li] I thought she might be
like a news anchor or something like that,

951
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:42,486
but this was unexpected.

952
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:44,447
It doesn't change my opinion, though.

953
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:46,073
[music fades]

954
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:47,450
[Ji-su] I'm actually…

955
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:51,329
-most curious about Do. I can't read her.
-[Sang-ho] Me too.

956
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:52,997
I don't think we could guess correctly.

957
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,749
[charming music playing]

958
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:57,126
[Jeong-mok] I was
especially curious about Do.

959
00:38:57,209 --> 00:38:58,919
I wanted to know how old she was first.

960
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,463
My age…

961
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:01,380
[music fades]

962
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,550
Born in '98.

963
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:06,177
[gasps]

964
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,303
[contestants exclaim]

965
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:09,347
-We're all the same age.
-I'm not.

966
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:11,349
Really? I thought you'd be older than me.

967
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:13,351
[whimsical music playing]

968
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:19,523
I actually thought she'd be older,
so it didn't faze me at all.

969
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:22,026
How should I address her?

970
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:23,736
Would it be okay if I just…

971
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:26,697
call her by her name?

972
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:30,201
As of now,
age doesn't really matter to me,

973
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:32,953
whether she's older,
the same age, or younger than me.

974
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:35,039
And your job?

975
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:39,293
I think you might be in entertainment,
like a YouTuber.

976
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:44,256
But with pink hair, I'm guessing
you aren't a regular office worker.

977
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,633
-Right?
-Of course. Of course.

978
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:48,094
Currently …

979
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:52,306
I work as an online lecturer.

980
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,474
[contestants exclaim]

981
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:55,309
-Geography?
-[Han-na] She's the brains.

982
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,728
-[Yeo-myung] Which subject?
-I teach geography.

983
00:39:57,812 --> 00:40:01,690
-I told you she was a geography teacher.
-[Min-hong] I knew it. She knew so much.

984
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:04,443
[Hyun-kyu] So that's why
you were so good with geography.

985
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:06,404
-[Do laughs]
-[gripping music playing]

986
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:08,614
I'm from Gumi, North Gyeongsang Province.

987
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:10,783
What is Gumi known for?

988
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:12,368
The electronic industry.

989
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:13,619
[laughs]

990
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:15,746
-I'm from Unjeong.
-Do you live in Unjeong?

991
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,373
[Yeo-myung] You know where that is?

992
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:18,833
Oh, I know. It's okay.

993
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:21,419
-[Yeo-myung] Oh, really? Yes, right.
-Unjeong New Town. I know.

994
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:24,380
-I'm from North Chungcheong.
-[Do] Where?

995
00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:27,091
-Cheongju. That's my parents' home.
-[Jeong-mok] Oh.

996
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:30,052
-Is that north of Hongseong?
-No, that's not even close.

997
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:31,637
-Is it?
-Sejong, Daejeon.

998
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,597
-[Ji-yeon] Totally.
-Cheongju is to the right.

999
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:37,101
-Cheongju has a population of 850,000.
-[Hyun-kyu] How do you know all that?

1000
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:39,812
-[Do] I know.
-Do you… Do you work for Korail?

1001
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:42,106
-What? No, no, no. I just…
-[Han-na] Oh, my.

1002
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:43,816
[Car] She's totally a geography teacher.

1003
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:46,110
She was dropping hints
that she knows geography.

1004
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:47,486
-Right.
-She couldn't hold it in.

1005
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,697
-All her knowledge.
-[Han-na] Right. Oh, boy.

1006
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,491
I can't figure anything out about Ji-yeon.

1007
00:40:52,575 --> 00:40:53,409
[Hyun-kyu] Hmm.

1008
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:55,161
-[Min-hong] She's a mystery.
-Hmm.

1009
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:57,371
I was born in '99.

1010
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:58,706
-[Seung-li exclaims]
-[chuckles]

1011
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:01,083
-We're the same age!
-[Hyun-kyu] We're the same age.

1012
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:04,003
-I majored in music composition…
-[Ji-su] Wow.

1013
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:06,255
…and I create the background music

1014
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:09,633
for metaverses or for game companies.

1015
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:10,801
[contestants exclaim]

1016
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:12,720
[Seung-chan] Wow, that's so cool.

1017
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:14,221
[upbeat music playing]

1018
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,182
[Ji-yeon] I'm a music producer.

1019
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:20,352
What about adding this effect
to the bass line?

1020
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:23,939
Let's just wipe that so it doesn't clash
with anything else.

1021
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:25,149
Oh, okay.

1022
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:27,985
-I never imagined she worked in music.
-[Eun-ji] It really suits her.

1023
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:29,403
Seriously. It totally does.

1024
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,529
[inaudible]

1025
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:33,240
[Ji-yeon] I've been working on commission,

1026
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:36,952
but from now on,
I want to start making my own music too.

1027
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:38,621
PARK JI-YEON, AGE 26
MUSIC PRODUCER

1028
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:41,457
-[Jeong-mok] Oh, really?
-[Hyun-kyu] Wow.

1029
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:44,710
[Jae-yun] There were some games
I loved when I was young,

1030
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:47,296
and they had memorable background music,

1031
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:51,258
so when Ji-yeon said
she composed music for games,

1032
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:53,427
that left an impression.

1033
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:56,055
I choose Min-hong.

1034
00:41:56,138 --> 00:41:57,139
[Seung-li] Min-hong.

1035
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:58,390
[Hyun-kyu] Go on.

1036
00:41:58,474 --> 00:42:02,186
So, I studied fashion marketing in school,

1037
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:08,234
and I've been working as a stylist
and fashion marketer until now,

1038
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:10,986
but I'm in the process of switching jobs.

1039
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,488
[exclaims]

1040
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:13,697
[upbeat music playing]

1041
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:17,326
[Min-hong] My current goal is to become
a fashion brand marketer.

1042
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:21,705
I wanted to work in e-commerce in Korea,

1043
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:24,208
so I used to work at company C,

1044
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:28,170
but right now, I want to
go back to fashion marketing,

1045
00:42:28,254 --> 00:42:29,922
which is what I love.

1046
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:34,510
Sometimes, I analyze
a whole season's worth of fashion shows.

1047
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:36,512
I'm even putting together a portfolio.

1048
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:40,015
[Eun-ji] Oh, cool.

1049
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:42,309
LEE MIN-HONG, AGE 28
IN BETWEEN JOBS, FASHION MARKETING

1050
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:44,895
I did notice that
she dresses particularly well.

1051
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:47,773
-Right. She's stylish.
-[Han-na] Right, I noticed her purse too.

1052
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:50,609
-And your age?
-[Seung-li] How old are you?

1053
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:52,903
I think she may be older than I thought.

1054
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:53,904
[contestants chuckle]

1055
00:42:53,988 --> 00:42:56,115
-I think she's been working for a while.
-[Do] Really?

1056
00:42:56,198 --> 00:42:58,450
-[Ji-su] But she looks young.
-[Seung-chan] '97?

1057
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:00,619
-[Sang-ho] Oh.
-I was born in '97.

1058
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:03,289
-[contestants exclaim]
-I knew it.

1059
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:04,373
HA JEONG-MOK, AGE 26

1060
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:06,750
-[Do] I thought you were my age.
-I'm older than you guys.

1061
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:10,045
-[Hyun-kyu] We're all around the same age.
-But I knew you were roughly my age.

1062
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:12,172
-[Seung-chan] But--
-But what if she's the oldest?

1063
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:14,383
-[Sang-ho] Right.
-[Do] I don't think that's the case.

1064
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:16,635
-[Ji-su] She might be.
-Let me take a guess.

1065
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:18,429
-[Yeo-myung] Guess.
-A pretty college girl.

1066
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:19,555
[laughs]

1067
00:43:19,638 --> 00:43:23,183
Oh, I thought she looked
like a college student too, in a way.

1068
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:25,603
Right, maybe
a nursing student or something.

1069
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:28,188
First of all, I am a college student.

1070
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:30,024
[contestants exclaim]

1071
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:32,067
-[Do] Ah.
-[Seung-li] Hmm.

1072
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:35,904
I interned at a local
credit guarantee fund,

1073
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:38,407
and I'm applying to jobs
in the finance sector.

1074
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:40,784
-Oh-ho.
-[upbeat music playing]

1075
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:44,330
[Yeo-myung] I'm a college student
majoring in business administration.

1076
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:46,582
Since I'm actively job-seeking now,

1077
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:48,626
I spend most of my time studying.

1078
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:52,546
And then I write cover letters and things
that interest me in my free time.

1079
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:56,759
KIM YEO-MYUNG, AGE 26

[music fades]

1081
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:00,220
-I was born in '99.
-[Jeong-mok] What?

1082
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:02,139
-Same age.
-[Hyun-kyu] All about the same age.

1083
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:04,433
Hey, buddy, I told you
we were the same age.

1084
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:05,893
[Sang-ho] We all are.

1085
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:07,436
I told you she was the oldest girl.

1086
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,229
Stop that. [chuckles]

1087
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:12,358
[Do] You should've guessed
two years lower.

1088
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:13,692
[Hyun-kyu] Oh, a message.

1089
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:15,736
[Ji-su] For… For women, their age…

1090
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:17,571
KIM MI-JI,
PLEASE MAKE YOUR WAY TO THE SUITE

1091
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,198
-Like… What?
-I…

1092
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:21,116
-[Ji-yeon] See you later.
-Going to the Suite?

1093
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,995
-[Mi-ji] Where is the Suite?
-The Suite is… Go that way and turn left.

1094
00:44:25,871 --> 00:44:27,831
But I wanted to stay longer.

1095
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:30,209

[inhales]

1098
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:46,642
[Han-na] Still, she gets to choose…

1099
00:44:46,725 --> 00:44:48,686
-[Car] Right.
-…two men that she liked the most.

1100
00:44:48,769 --> 00:44:51,563
But will she pick Sang-ho again?
After such a long date?

1101
00:44:52,147 --> 00:44:54,525
Currently, my top choice is Mi-ji.

1102
00:44:55,984 --> 00:44:59,029
If I get a one-on-one date with her,
I'll try to lead the conversation.

1103
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:00,823
I think Sang-ho got his hopes up.

1104
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:02,616
He put his hands together like…

1105
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:05,077
-[cell phone chimes]
-[Ji-yeon] Hmm?

1106
00:45:05,577 --> 00:45:06,870
Who'll it be?

1107
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:10,707
[Eun-ji] It's not Sang-ho. Seung-li?

1108
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:13,669
LEE SEUNG-CHAN, PLEASE ENTER THE SUITE

1109

-[Seung-chan] Hello.
-Oh, hello.

1118
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:45,868
Well, just come right in.

1120
00:45:47,202 --> 00:45:50,414
-Please sit.
-So, actually, I was here yesterday…

1121
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:51,999
-Really?
-…just like you.

1122
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:54,376
Oh, you have some experience then.

1123
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:56,462
[both chuckle]

1124
00:45:57,713 --> 00:45:59,214
Thank you for picking me.

1125
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:00,549
Jeez, no.

1126
00:46:00,632 --> 00:46:01,884
[chuckles]

1127
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:03,594
You wanna know why I picked you?

1128
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:05,220
Yeah, I really do.

1129
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:07,431
Will you…
[chuckles] Are you gonna tell me?

1130
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:08,640
[mellow music playing]

1131
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:10,434
So, when we were talking,

1132
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:13,979
you seemed to speak so well
and keep the conversation flowing…

1133
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:14,897
Oh, I see.

1134
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:17,983
…and I'm looking for someone
who's cheerful and energetic.

1135
00:46:18,066 --> 00:46:20,027
-[Seung-chan] Hmm.
-Yeah. [laughs]

1136
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:23,238
-So, I liked that about you.
-Hmm.

1137
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:25,282
Yeah, you seem to make people
feel at ease.

1138
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:26,200
I kept thinking…

1139
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:28,285
-[chuckles] "Do I stick out too much?"
-No, no, no.

1140
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:29,745
Especially for us eternal singles,

1141
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:31,705
-we need someone to lead the mood.
-Oh, really?

1142
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:35,459
[Seung-chan] I guess
I must be doing a good job.

1143
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,921
I was going to ask why she picked me,

1144
00:46:39,004 --> 00:46:42,508
but I didn't even have to,
she just told me. So, I thought,

1145
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:45,636
"Oh, she must be
a very confident and honest person."

1146
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:47,387
-[inaudible]
-[music fades]

1147
00:46:48,013 --> 00:46:49,640
Yeah, she left. She went over there.

1148
00:46:49,723 --> 00:46:50,724
-Huh?
-[cell phones chime]

1149
00:46:50,807 --> 00:46:52,518
-[Do] Oh, what's that?
-[Hyun-kyu] What?

1150
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:57,397
"The random spot date will begin."

1151
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,066
We're doing the spot date.

1152
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:01,735
[Car] Today,
the men will go to a certain spot.

1153
00:47:01,818 --> 00:47:04,863
-[Han-na] The women will visit them.
-[Yeo-myung] Everyone, take an envelope.

1154
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:06,698
-Let's move quickly.
-Are these for the men?

1155
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:08,033
[Yeo-myung] Yeah, the blue one.

1156
00:47:08,116 --> 00:47:09,910
-Take one, pass it on.
-It's random anyway.

1157
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:11,870
-[Ji-su] Yeah, random.
-[Hyun-kyu] All random.

1158
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:14,581
-This is your fate.
-[Hyun-kyu] Jae-yun. Hey, look at this.

1159
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:19,294
I hope Do and Jeong-mok

1160
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:20,879
-get to have a date.
-[Car] Yes.

1161
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:23,882
-Or maybe Yeo-myung and Jeong-mok.
-Yeo-myung and Jeong-mok.

1162
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:26,426
I hope the ones who've
missed each other get to meet.

1163
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:27,344
[Han-na] Right.

1164
00:47:27,427 --> 00:47:28,720
[insects trilling]

1165
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:31,640
[whirring]

1166
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:36,812
-Peekaboo.
-Hey. Hi.

1167
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:37,896
[Min-hong] Peekaboo.

1168
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:39,106
Do you want some wine?

1169
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:41,858
[Car] These two
don't have feelings for each other, right?

1170
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:44,486
-[Eun-ji laughing]
-[Car] A little liquid courage.

1171
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:49,074
-That good?
-Yeah.

1172
00:47:49,866 --> 00:47:52,160
Aren't you supposed to
hold red wine like this?

1173
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:54,121
Just drink however the hell you want.

1174
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:56,331
-"However the hell"?
-[all laughing]

1175
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:59,209
-They don't care about each other at all.
-They don't care at all.

1176
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:03,046
They don't care. I bet they'd scrub
each other's backs and not catch feelings.

1177
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:04,881
-[Car] No feelings involved.
-Totally could.

1178
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:06,091
[Car] They really could.

1179
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:08,969
-It's a best friend vibe.
-They're just drinking. That's awesome.

1180
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:10,178
[glasses clink]

1181
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:12,431
How… However the hell I want. Okay.

1182
00:48:13,682 --> 00:48:15,309
-That's nice.
-How'd it go today?

1183
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,355
-Well…
-Yeah.

1184
00:48:20,439 --> 00:48:22,316
You seem pretty excited today.

1185
00:48:22,941 --> 00:48:25,235
Yeah. I worried about being too nervous.

1186
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:27,863
-In the end, it wasn't worth the worry.
-You worry a lot.

1187
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:30,616
Being worried
doesn't help the situation in the end.

1188
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:33,285
If worrying made it go away,
I wouldn't be worried.

1189
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:36,288
-And it wasn't worth the worry.
-Oh, of course.

1190
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:38,915
-Aren't I a good big sis?
-Oh, yeah.

1191
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:40,751
You should say, "Thanks, ma'am."

1192
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:41,877
You're born in '80?

1193
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,128
[playful music playing]

1194
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:44,588
-'97.
-Just kidding.

1195
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:47,257
-[In-guk] He likes jokes like that.
-How about you?

1196
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:49,051
-'98.
-'98?

1197
00:48:49,134 --> 00:48:50,802
-I am older.
-Yes, you are.

1198
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:53,805
[Han-na] Min-hong is treating him
like a younger brother all of a sudden.

1199
00:48:55,223 --> 00:48:57,017
-I was mistaken.
-Right.

1200
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:59,936
-We didn't like the same person.
-You thought…

1201
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:02,439
you and your roommate liked the same girl?

1202
00:49:02,522 --> 00:49:04,524
It turns out that we don't.

1203
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:05,901
LAST NIGHT

1204
00:49:05,984 --> 00:49:07,986
-I have a pretty clear ideal type.
-Oh, really?

1205
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:10,697
Who is it? You like Do too?

1206
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:12,032
It's Yeo-myung.

1207
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:13,950
Yeo-myung? I didn't know.

1208
00:49:16,703 --> 00:49:19,039
-Actually, my top choice is…
-Yeah?

1209
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:21,583
The person who sat next to me.

1210
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:22,918
Yeo-myung?

1211
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:24,252
Oh, okay.

1212
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:29,341
Until you said that,

1213
00:49:30,175 --> 00:49:33,762
I really thought you liked me.

1214
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:35,722
-[chuckles]
-[whimsical music playing]

1215
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:38,141
-That's how bad my hunch is.
-Oh.

1216
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:41,812
I always count my chickens
before they even hatch.

1217
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:45,399
I'm not even joking.
I'm practically a chicken farmer.

1218
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:47,234
-[chuckles]
-[laughs]

1219
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:49,277
-She did get ahead of herself.
-[Han-na] Yeah.

1220
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:51,029
-[Car] Right.
-Oh, I never even imagined.

1221
00:49:51,113 --> 00:49:52,823
-[Min-hong] Right, sorry.
-I mean, okay.

1222
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:54,741
[music fades]

1223
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:58,245
So, do you feel totally at ease now?

1224
00:49:58,328 --> 00:49:59,705
I do, but…

1225
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:02,165
Yeah, but you also feel anxious.

1226
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:04,251
I mean, I feel anxious too.

1227
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:06,461
I liked how things went today.

1228
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:10,841
I had fun, but the other person
might not feel the same way.

1229
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:12,300
Hmm. Oh, right.

1230
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:14,177
Why? Do you know?

1231
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:15,554
If you do, tell me.

1232
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:18,432
Your big sis gave you some advice.

1233
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:22,477
Oh, but I didn't really ask
much about his date, so… Yeah.

1234
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:24,604
I'm worried…

1235
00:50:25,772 --> 00:50:28,984
Jeong-mok might not be interested in me.

1236
00:50:29,776 --> 00:50:30,902
It's not that.

1237
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:32,821
[whimsical music playing]

1238
00:50:32,904 --> 00:50:34,239
Then I shouldn't worry?

1239
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:37,784
No, I don't think
you should be too worried.

1240
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:40,996
Okay, thank you.

1241
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:44,958
You can come to me
if something's on your mind.

1242
00:50:45,041 --> 00:50:46,126
Mmm.

1243
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:47,043
Okay.

1244
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:49,963
-Aw. They're best friends.
-[Han-na] Yeah, they've gotten close.

1245
00:50:50,046 --> 00:50:52,799
They could give each other good advice,
with a dynamic like this.

1246
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:54,342
-[Han-na] They're comfortable.
-Yeah.

1247
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:57,137
Min-hong could ask about Jeong-mok,

1248
00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:00,265
since Jae-yun and Jeong-mok are roommates.

1249
00:51:00,348 --> 00:51:02,017
Right, yes, they could.

1250
00:51:03,101 --> 00:51:04,186
PATIO
JEONG-MOK

1251
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:05,937
Who will come to Jeong-mok?

1252
00:51:15,113 --> 00:51:16,740
[Do] I was hoping Do would come.

1253
00:51:16,823 --> 00:51:18,533
[gentle music playing]

1254
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:21,912
[In-guk] I wonder who it'll be.

1255
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:26,875
[music fades]

1256
00:51:29,628 --> 00:51:31,296
-[Han-na] What?
-[Car] Hey!

1257
00:51:31,379 --> 00:51:33,215
Be good, Jeong-mok.

1258
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:34,466
What? [gasps]

1259
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:36,051
-It's Do.
-[Eun-ji] Is it Do?

1260
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:39,304
-[exclaims joyfully]
-[Han-na] Wow!

1261
00:51:39,387 --> 00:51:41,681
[enchanting music playing]

1262
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:43,225
Be good, Jeong-mok.

1263
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:47,771
Hi, Do.

1264
00:51:52,692 --> 00:51:54,027
[Do] Hello.

1265
00:51:54,110 --> 00:51:55,278
Hello.

1266
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:56,488
[chuckles]

1267
00:51:56,571 --> 00:51:58,990
[Han-na] I guess
he fell for her at first sight.

1268
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:02,494
[Jeong-mok] For the first impression pick,
I voted for Do.

1269
00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:08,291
Then I'll go with tea.

1270
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:09,709
[Eun-ji] Oh, right.

1271
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:11,419
THEY MISSED EACH OTHER ON THE FIRST DATE

1272
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:13,171
YI DO, PLEASE ENTER THE SUITE

1273
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:14,923
"Across from the forest?"

1274
00:52:15,006 --> 00:52:17,801
[Han-na] Right, Jeong-mok
was only looking at Do back then too.

1275
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:20,178
[Jeong-mok] I didn't have
any opportunities.

1276
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:22,180
I wish I had had a chance first.

1277
00:52:22,848 --> 00:52:25,934
JEONG-MOK HAD ALWAYS LIKED YI DO

1278
00:52:26,017 --> 00:52:29,980
Ever since the very beginning,
Jeong-mok has been into Do.

1279
00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:33,608
-Finally, Jeong-mok gets his chance too.
-[Eun-ji] I hope time goes by slowly.

1280
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:34,526
Great.

1281
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:37,654
[Jeong-mok] I was so happy.

1282
00:52:37,737 --> 00:52:40,657
We actually didn't have
any chances to talk before this,

1283
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,492
but I finally got my opportunity.

1284
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:44,160
I thought I should take this time

1285
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:45,996
-to really get to know her.
-[Han-na] Do it!

1286
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:49,457
This is the bench
in front of the rooms, right?

1287
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:50,750
-Yeah.
-Right.

1288
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:51,877
You're not drinking?

1289
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,212
-I'm actually trying not to drink alcohol…
-Yeah, okay.

1290
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:56,756
-Right.
-…since my throat doesn't feel good.

1291
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,508
I'm trying to drink water.

1292
00:53:00,927 --> 00:53:02,053
Okay.

1293
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:03,805
Okay, thanks for understanding.

1294
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:06,683
-[Han-na] He's really happy right now.
-[Eun-ji] He looks too excited.

1295
00:53:06,766 --> 00:53:08,351
-[squeals]
-[Han-na] This kid…

1296
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:10,312
Jeong-mok seems mesmerized.

1297
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:13,773
-Has he ever put on such a big smile?
-What? When he's with the other girls,

1298
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:15,442
he looks totally different.

1299
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:18,361
-[Do] Hey, we finally get to talk.
-I know.

1300
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:19,863
We haven't had the chance.

1301
00:53:21,573 --> 00:53:22,782
I've been wanting to…

1302
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:24,075
-I know.
-…talk to you.

1303
00:53:24,159 --> 00:53:25,160
[chuckles softly]

1304
00:53:27,245 --> 00:53:28,163
[Do] Hmm.

1305
00:53:28,955 --> 00:53:30,832
Right. Hmm.

1306
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:35,670
-[In-guk] So, talk!
-[Eun-ji] Go on.

1307
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:39,925
What should we talk about?
I thought about it, but I'm blanking.

1308
00:53:40,008 --> 00:53:42,135
[whimsical music playing]

1309
00:53:43,219 --> 00:53:44,304
Too many bugs.

1310
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:46,598
It's fine.
I'm just slightly afraid of big ones.

1311
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:49,100
-In my room, there's a huge grasshopper.
-Yeah.

1312
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:51,811
We can't catch it,
so we're just living with it.

1313
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:54,147
-A grasshopper, your new girlfriend?
-Wanna see?

1314
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:55,607
-No.
-It should still be there.

1315
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:57,817
Will you bring it out like this?
What will you do?

1316
00:53:57,901 --> 00:53:59,778
You can see it
if you go like this by the door.

1317
00:53:59,861 --> 00:54:01,696
-Oh, really?
-Yeah. [chuckles]

1318
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:02,656
You don't have to.

1319
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:05,575
Oh, but shouldn't you catch it like this
and let it go outside?

1320
00:54:06,284 --> 00:54:07,327
I'm scared.

1321
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:12,582
[Jeong-mok] Once I was
actually facing her,

1322
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:17,128
I was so nervous that I didn't know
what my face was doing or what I said.

1323
00:54:18,463 --> 00:54:19,381
[music fades]

1324
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:20,882
So…

1325
00:54:21,549 --> 00:54:23,635
You picked Seung-li for your date?

1326
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:26,221
Yeah, I was curious.

1327
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:27,347
-You were curious?
-Yeah.

1328
00:54:28,723 --> 00:54:29,808
Hmm.

1329
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:33,228
How was your date…

1330
00:54:33,311 --> 00:54:34,312
Well, it…

1331
00:54:34,396 --> 00:54:36,106
Oh, me first. The date…

1332
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:40,986
That's when I remembered the question
I read in the 5 Minute Library.

1333
00:54:41,736 --> 00:54:43,780
-[gasps] Right, right.
-[exclaims]

1334
00:54:44,572 --> 00:54:47,200
[Jeong-mok] What she wants to hear
after a guy she likes

1335
00:54:47,283 --> 00:54:49,661
comes back from a date with someone else.

1336
00:54:49,744 --> 00:54:53,039
She had said
that she wants to hear what they did,

1337
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:55,083
but that nothing much happened.

1338
00:54:56,251 --> 00:54:57,377
The date…

1339
00:54:58,753 --> 00:55:00,088
-It was fun.
-Was it?

1340
00:55:00,171 --> 00:55:01,381
Yeah, it was…

1341
00:55:02,173 --> 00:55:03,258
comfortable.

1342
00:55:03,341 --> 00:55:05,635
But, like, nothing much happened.

1343
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:07,512
-[Han-na chuckles]
-[chuckles] Oh, really?

1344
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:09,472
-Yeah. Nothing much. Yeah.
-The haunted house?

1345
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:11,433
[Eun-ji] Did she catch
"Nothing much happened"?

1346
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:13,101
-She'd catch it.
-[Eun-ji] Right?

1347
00:55:13,184 --> 00:55:15,228
She must know
he went to the 5 Minute Library.

1348
00:55:15,311 --> 00:55:18,148
-Yeah. Right.
-She should know he read her diary there.

1349
00:55:18,231 --> 00:55:19,816
-[Jeong-mok] What?
-I see.

1350
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:21,609
I still had fun.

1351
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:24,112
-It sounded fun.
-Yeah, it was cool.

1352
00:55:24,946 --> 00:55:26,448
But, like… [clicks tongue]

1353
00:55:26,531 --> 00:55:27,365
Yeah.

1354
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:29,868
-It was nice. Yeah.
-Nice.

1355
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:34,330
-So…
-Mm-hmm?

1356
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:38,168
Can I ask who you voted for
in the first impression pick?

1357
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:42,088
Am I allowed to tell you?

1358
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:43,631
Yeah, I think so.

1359
00:55:43,715 --> 00:55:44,716
-Really?
-Yeah.

1360
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:49,220
-Mmm…
-Should I go first?

1361
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:50,138
Okay.

1362
00:55:50,221 --> 00:55:51,306
I voted for you.

1363
00:55:51,389 --> 00:55:52,307
Oh, really?

1364
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:54,517
That's why I'm asking. I'm curious.

1365
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:55,852
I voted for you too.

1366
00:55:55,935 --> 00:55:57,020
I voted for you too.

1367
00:55:57,103 --> 00:55:58,438
[Eun-ji and Han-na scream]

1368
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:00,356
-[Han-na chuckles]
-[Eun-ji laughs]

1369
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:03,276
What? What if they hit it off now?

1370
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:04,652
I voted for you too.

1371
00:56:04,736 --> 00:56:05,862
-Really?
-Yeah.

1372
00:56:05,945 --> 00:56:07,572
[enchanting music playing]

1373
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:09,199
Oh.

1374
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:11,534
I see.

1375
00:56:12,327 --> 00:56:13,161
At first…

1376
00:56:13,787 --> 00:56:15,205
-Oh.
-I did, I did.

1377
00:56:15,288 --> 00:56:16,122
Really?

1378
00:56:16,706 --> 00:56:19,167
But I just didn't get a chance…

1379
00:56:20,418 --> 00:56:21,336
to talk.

1380
00:56:21,419 --> 00:56:24,506
Right. We got a chance on the third night.

1381
00:56:25,256 --> 00:56:27,926
[Do] He said, "I voted for you."

1382
00:56:29,260 --> 00:56:31,221
I was so shocked hearing that,

1383
00:56:31,304 --> 00:56:33,473
I got all confused.

1384
00:56:37,727 --> 00:56:39,646
[Jeong-mok] She said she voted for me.

1385
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:41,606
I was actually surprised.

1386
00:56:43,316 --> 00:56:44,400
How do I…

1387
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:46,736
We chose each other, so…

1388
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:47,654
Oh?

1389
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:50,323
Something like this is happening to me?

1390
00:56:50,406 --> 00:56:51,699
[chuckles]

1391
00:56:51,783 --> 00:56:54,202
I don't really know why she chose me,

1392
00:56:54,285 --> 00:56:58,081
but I think I just thought,
"I'm glad. I'm thankful."

1393
00:56:58,164 --> 00:57:00,542
"If we grow closer from now on,

1394
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:03,586
things could actually work out."

1395
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:04,921
I was really happy.

1396
00:57:05,713 --> 00:57:08,925
-God, to find this out on the third night.
-[In-guk] It's like fate.

1397
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:11,636
-Yes, right.
-Things are really falling into place.

1398
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:14,139
God, I'm so happy for these two.

1399
00:57:14,222 --> 00:57:16,641
I think… I think
something might happen for these guys.

1400
00:57:16,724 --> 00:57:19,519
-I guess that can really happen…
-[In-guk] Right.

1401
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:20,728
[Do] Mmm.

1402
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:22,147
I had no idea.

1403
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:23,565
-Really?
-Yeah.

1404
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:25,650
I figured you picked someone else.

1405
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:27,610
Who did you think I picked?

1406
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:30,488
I thought Min-hong.

1407
00:57:30,572 --> 00:57:31,489
Min-hong?

1408
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:33,908
You guys were talking a lot.

1409
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:36,703
Well, we were paired up to cook together.

1410
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:38,037
Oh, I see.

1411
00:57:39,914 --> 00:57:40,999
But thank you.

1412
00:57:41,082 --> 00:57:43,209
-I thought I had zero votes until now.
-Why?

1413
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:45,753
-I thought I did too, but I guess not.
-Yay!

1414
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:47,046
[chuckles softly]

1415
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:49,174
[Eun-ji] She said, "Yay,"
and he looks that happy?

1416
00:57:49,257 --> 00:57:51,342
That's love right there. What will he do?

1417
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:52,427
YOUR 15 MINUTES IS UP

1418
00:57:52,510 --> 00:57:54,053
-No!
-[In-guk] That's a shame.

1419
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:56,473
-[Car] Oh, bummer!
-[Do] Yeah, it was good seeing you.

1420
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:58,224
We finally got to talk.

1421
00:57:58,308 --> 00:58:00,185
-See you soon.
-You have to stay here.

1422
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:01,728
-Yeah, I'll stay.
-Yeah, bye.

1423
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:03,813
[pleasant music playing]

1424
00:58:06,399 --> 00:58:07,609
[groans softly]

1425
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:11,446
I thought it would've been nice
to have some more time.

1426
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:13,907
But this wasn't a set date.

1427
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:15,325
It was just random,

1428
00:58:15,408 --> 00:58:18,745
so I didn't have
any questions prepared or anything.

1429
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:22,123
I tried my best,
but I did feel kind of disappointed

1430
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:24,709
that we didn't get more time
to talk to each other.

1431
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:27,879
Can't they say something like,

1432
00:58:27,962 --> 00:58:30,798
"After everything is done,
let's meet at the pool for a bit."

1433
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:33,259
-Why aren't they doing that?
-Why aren't they doing that?

1434
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:37,263
-They're not talking more on their own.
-Why are they only doing as they're told?

1435
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:39,516
Why, at 10:00 p.m.?
What time did they go to bed?

1436
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:41,601
-What time did they go to sleep?
-[Han-na] But…

1437
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:43,436
Tell me. What time did they go to bed?

1438
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,438
-Probably at 9:30.
-[Eun-ji] 9:30?

1439
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:48,399
-That's why they're single since birth.
-[Eun-ji] They have lights-out?

1440
00:58:48,483 --> 00:58:51,653
Yeah. They go to bed at 9:30
and wake up at 6:00.

1441
00:58:51,736 --> 00:58:53,279
But why would they do that?

1442
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:56,199
I bet these guys ask permission
before going to the bathroom.

1443
00:58:56,282 --> 00:58:57,492
-[laughs]
-[Car] No way.

1444
00:58:57,575 --> 00:58:59,994
-[Han-na] They go when allowed.
-[Car] They're way too nice.

1445
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:01,621
[sighs in exasperation]

1446
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:03,039
-Should we cheers?
-Sure.

1447
00:59:03,122 --> 00:59:03,998
Cheers!

1448
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:06,334
[Car] Mi-ji chose Hyun-kyu. Okay.

1449
00:59:06,417 --> 00:59:08,253
[Han-na] So she chose
Seung-chan and Hyun-kyu.

1450
00:59:08,336 --> 00:59:09,796
[Car] Just in terms of looks.

1451
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:11,506
[slow groovy music playing]

1452
00:59:11,589 --> 00:59:14,008
-Should we pick?
-[In-guk] Oh, the second round?

1453
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:16,010
-Did you just pick randomly?
-Yeah.

1454
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:17,679
Anything is fine by me.

1455
00:59:17,762 --> 00:59:19,847
[Do] Oh, I must be going
to the same place.

1456
00:59:19,931 --> 00:59:21,349
[Ji-su] Wait, where's the Rooftop?

1457
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:24,477
-[Min-hong] Let's go.
-[Ji-yeon] I'll be back.

1458
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:28,398
[mellow music playing]

1459
00:59:35,905 --> 00:59:39,325
[Jeong-mok] I thought,
"It would be nice if Do came again."

1460
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:41,619
[Car] Is it Min-hong this time? Oh.

1461
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:44,038
[In-guk] Look at her face.

1462
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:49,794
[Eun-ji] Oh, not Do.
I don't think it's Do.

1463
00:59:49,877 --> 00:59:51,129
[In-guk] Oh, Yeo-myung?

1464
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:53,965
Mmm.

1465
00:59:55,383 --> 00:59:56,301
[music fades]

1466
01:00:00,471 --> 01:00:02,307
[enthralling music playing]

1467
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:04,017
-Oh, my God.
-[In-guk] Who is it?

1468
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:06,894
[woman] Jeong-mok,

1469
01:00:07,395 --> 01:00:08,521
be good.

1470
01:00:10,023 --> 01:00:11,065
[Han-na and Eun-ji gasp]

1471
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:12,191
[Han-na] What?

1472
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:13,359
What?

1473
01:00:14,652 --> 01:00:16,613
-Is it Do again?
-[Han-na] Did Do pick him twice?

1474
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:18,948
-Wow, things are working out.
-[Car] Oh, check it out!

1475
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:21,743
-I think they'll end up together.
-[Han-na] This is gonna happen.

1476
01:00:21,826 --> 01:00:23,620
[Eun-ji] What is this?
How could this happen?

1477
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:26,456
This is great. This is fate, right here.

1478
01:00:29,208 --> 01:00:30,418
[Han-na] Wow.

1479
01:00:31,377 --> 01:00:33,212
-[Do] Again?
-Oh, you're here again?

1480
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:35,673
[Do] We're matched again. [chuckles]

1481
01:00:37,967 --> 01:00:39,677
[Jeong-mok] The cosmos must be guiding us.

1482
01:00:39,761 --> 01:00:41,929
Until now, we didn't get a chance to talk,

1483
01:00:42,013 --> 01:00:43,973
but now I'm getting my chance
to get to know her.

1484
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:45,642
I mean, I'm not religious, but…

1485
01:00:46,267 --> 01:00:49,145
maybe I should use this chance
to express my feelings.

1486
01:00:49,228 --> 01:00:50,772
[music fades]

1487
01:00:50,855 --> 01:00:52,523
Wow. I mean, what is this?

1488
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:56,277
We didn't have time to talk until now,
so should get everything out?

1489
01:00:56,361 --> 01:00:57,862
-Mm-hmm.
-I was just shocked now.

1490
01:00:57,945 --> 01:01:00,740
-How could both…
-I never even imagined.

1491
01:01:00,823 --> 01:01:01,824
Disappointed?

1492
01:01:01,908 --> 01:01:05,286
No, I'm not,
because we didn't get to talk much before.

1493
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:08,247
-I'm curious about that, though.
-What?

1494
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:10,750
So, like now…

1495
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:11,709
Yeah.

1496
01:01:11,793 --> 01:01:14,379
Do you have feelings for someone or not?

1497
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:16,756
-Out of the people here.
-Do I like someone?

1498
01:01:20,093 --> 01:01:21,552
-I do.
-Really?

1499
01:01:21,636 --> 01:01:22,470
Hmm.

1500
01:01:22,553 --> 01:01:23,596
-Yeah.
-Oh.

1501
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,431
-You don't, do you?
-No, it's not that.

1502
01:01:25,515 --> 01:01:26,349
Okay.

1503
01:01:26,432 --> 01:01:28,184
-I thought the men…
-Yeah.

1504
01:01:28,267 --> 01:01:30,978
…weren't particularly
interested in anyone.

1505
01:01:31,771 --> 01:01:32,689
Hmm.

1506
01:01:32,772 --> 01:01:35,650
Because we don't
show our feelings that much?

1507
01:01:35,733 --> 01:01:37,318
Yeah, so I thought,

1508
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:39,987
"What should we even do?"

1509
01:01:40,863 --> 01:01:43,574
Yeah. This is news to me.

1510
01:01:44,242 --> 01:01:46,786
I was thinking about it, actually.

1511
01:01:46,869 --> 01:01:48,746
When should I, like…

1512
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:50,957
Should I just say how I feel?

1513
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:51,958
Oh.

1514
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:56,379
If you get to choose

1515
01:01:56,462 --> 01:01:58,381
-your date partner tomorrow…
-Mm-hmm.

1516
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:00,591
…like we did today…

1517
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:02,301
-Yeah.
-…who would you choose?

1518
01:02:04,011 --> 01:02:05,388
I'll choose you, of course.

1519
01:02:05,888 --> 01:02:07,223
-Why?
-What?

1520
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:10,727
I wanted to date you from the beginning.

1521
01:02:11,936 --> 01:02:13,062
-Really?
-Yeah.

1522
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:15,148
[enchanting music playing]

1523
01:02:16,858 --> 01:02:18,317
That never occurred to me.

1524
01:02:18,401 --> 01:02:19,485
On the first day…

1525
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:21,779
-Yes? Right.
-We had to choose the drinks.

1526
01:02:21,863 --> 01:02:23,906
-I saw that you had chosen tea…
-Yes.

1527
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:26,951
-…so I was gonna pick that too.
-Yes.

1528
01:02:27,034 --> 01:02:28,911
-But I didn't have a choice.
-Ah.

1529
01:02:30,121 --> 01:02:33,958
[Do] Jeong-mok was being
really direct about his feelings.

1530
01:02:34,667 --> 01:02:36,002
Actually,

1531
01:02:36,085 --> 01:02:38,755
I was kind of flustered too because…

1532
01:02:39,464 --> 01:02:42,508
the girls talked
amongst ourselves last night.

1533
01:02:43,092 --> 01:02:47,013
There were a few who said
they were interested in Jeong-mok.

1534
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:52,560
But since he was suddenly telling me
that he liked me,

1535
01:02:53,895 --> 01:02:57,523
I felt so confused,
like, "What should I do?"

1536
01:02:57,607 --> 01:03:00,902
But also, on the other hand,
I felt really hurt by Seung-li,

1537
01:03:01,569 --> 01:03:06,073
so it was just this huge shock
and mixture of feelings all of a sudden.

1538
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:10,536
You don't want to date me?

1539
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:11,788
No, that's not it.

1540
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:13,331
It's just a shock.

1541
01:03:13,414 --> 01:03:15,792
I feel like someone smacked me just now.

1542
01:03:16,334 --> 01:03:18,044
You hit me, didn't you?

1543
01:03:18,127 --> 01:03:19,629
-I guess I did.
-[chuckles]

1544
01:03:20,755 --> 01:03:23,841
[Jeong-mok] I think
I felt more attracted to her as a woman.

1545
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:26,010
Just the way she talks.

1546
01:03:26,093 --> 01:03:27,261
How she laughs.

1547
01:03:27,345 --> 01:03:30,932
I think I could see it more now,
since I was solely focused on her.

1548
01:03:32,266 --> 01:03:37,021
I thought, "I should express
how I feel more directly and openly."

1549
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:41,275
And I should try as hard as I can
to go on a date with Do tomorrow.

1550
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:43,694
-[Car and Eun-ji exclaim]
-[Han-na gasps]

1551
01:03:43,778 --> 01:03:46,572
-Oh, this guy… He's good.
-[Han-na and Eun-ji laughing]

1552
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:48,241
This little punk is good.

1553
01:03:48,324 --> 01:03:51,744
Jeong-mok must've thought,
"Here's my chance," and just went for it.

1554
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:53,830
[Han-na] Yes, right, right. That's cool.

1555
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:56,916
And during the second date,
after he became more relaxed,

1556
01:03:56,999 --> 01:03:59,335
-you could really see Jeong-mok's charm.
-Yes.

1557
01:03:59,418 --> 01:04:01,629
It's different
from the first 15-minute date too.

1558
01:04:01,712 --> 01:04:03,548
Smiling and saying,
"Don't you wanna date me?"

1559
01:04:03,631 --> 01:04:04,799
[Han-na] I know.

1560
01:04:04,882 --> 01:04:07,426
To a certain degree,
Jeong-mok could've sensed,

1561
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:10,221
"Oh, this might actually work,"
during their conversation.

1562
01:04:10,304 --> 01:04:12,265
-Yes, there's hope for him now.
-[In-guk] Right.

1563
01:04:14,475 --> 01:04:16,727
[Car] This is
kind of a discreet place, right?

1564
01:04:18,771 --> 01:04:19,939
[sighs]

1565
01:04:27,071 --> 01:04:29,365
-Should I take off my shoes?
-[Seung-li] Oh. Ji-su.

[In-guk] Is it a fateful day or what?

1568
01:04:32,159 --> 01:04:34,078
-Finally.
-[Eun-ji] He said, "Finally."

1569
01:04:34,161 --> 01:04:36,414
-[Seung-li] We finally get to meet.
-Seriously.

1570
01:04:36,497 --> 01:04:38,040
Oh, you can sit here.

1571
01:04:39,166 --> 01:04:41,002
-Here's a good spot.
-Okay.

1572
01:04:41,085 --> 01:04:42,169
I sat here yesterday.

1573
01:04:42,962 --> 01:04:43,796
Here?

1574
01:04:44,380 --> 01:04:46,340
[groovy enchanting music playing]

1575
01:04:48,467 --> 01:04:51,137
[Seung-li] Oh, I was so happy.
Today was the first time ever.

1576
01:04:52,096 --> 01:04:54,056
I've been waiting for this moment.

1577
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:56,642
I'm gonna try to express as much as I can.

1578
01:05:00,521 --> 01:05:01,939
My heart was racing.

1579
01:05:02,857 --> 01:05:04,108
[music fades]

1580
01:05:04,191 --> 01:05:06,068
-So, are you having fun?
-Me?

1581
01:05:06,944 --> 01:05:08,863
-Why are you speaking formally?
-Oh.

1582
01:05:09,447 --> 01:05:11,657
Wait, how old are you?
I think you're older than me.

1583
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:12,617
Born in '98.

1584
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:14,577
Oh! Can I speak casually?

1585
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:15,745
Yeah, sure, go ahead.

1586
01:05:15,828 --> 01:05:18,331
-I don't really care about that stuff.
-Oh, really?

1587
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:19,957
How'd it go?

1588
01:05:20,041 --> 01:05:21,167
-Me?
-Yeah.

1589
01:05:22,001 --> 01:05:24,003
My date? It was fun.

1590
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:26,756
-Fun? Tell me more, give me details.
-Okay, in detail?

1591
01:05:26,839 --> 01:05:31,636
Well, I have two people I'm interested in,
to be honest.

1592
01:05:33,387 --> 01:05:37,058
But the gap between my number one
and number two is very big.

1593
01:05:37,683 --> 01:05:40,895
But as for today, well, to be honest…

1594
01:05:40,978 --> 01:05:42,980
I mean, I didn't tell Do this,

1595
01:05:44,231 --> 01:05:46,651
but she wasn't one of those two.

1596
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:49,278
-I just--
-Oh. Oh, really?

1597
01:05:49,362 --> 01:05:52,698
Yeah, so I had a good time,

1598
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:57,411
but on the other hand,
I felt bad for her, but… [clicks tongue]

1599
01:05:58,829 --> 01:06:00,081
So, yeah.

1600
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:03,709
Well, it was kind of awkward to ask.

1601
01:06:04,293 --> 01:06:06,337
-But that can happen.
-Then… [clicks tongue]

1602
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:07,713
So then,

1603
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:10,925
do you have someone
you're interested in here?

1604
01:06:12,051 --> 01:06:13,844
-I'm interested in?
-Yeah.

1605
01:06:13,928 --> 01:06:18,140
Honestly, I think
I feel similarly about everyone.

1606
01:06:18,724 --> 01:06:19,725
On the first day,

1607
01:06:20,476 --> 01:06:24,438
-I chose three people I felt attracted to.
-Okay.

1608
01:06:25,189 --> 01:06:27,400
But they're all pretty similar.

[exhales]

1610
01:06:29,527 --> 01:06:30,736
So, yeah.

1611
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:35,032
Now, I'm curious.
You said you were attracted to three guys.

1612
01:06:35,116 --> 01:06:36,701
-Yeah.
-Then,

1613
01:06:38,536 --> 01:06:41,205
would you be open to someone
other than those three?

1614
01:06:41,288 --> 01:06:43,791
-If someone were to approach you?
-Mmm.

1615
01:06:43,874 --> 01:06:46,002
Or is there no chance for that person?

1616
01:06:49,088 --> 01:06:50,381
Mmm.

1617
01:06:50,464 --> 01:06:52,049
Who did you vote for

1618
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:54,176
-in the first impression pick?
-Yeah.

1619
01:06:56,137 --> 01:06:57,596
Can I tell you?

1620
01:06:57,680 --> 01:06:59,473
-Yeah, tell me. Can't we say it?
-I…

1621
01:07:01,308 --> 01:07:02,476
Honestly,

1622
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:04,520
I voted for you.

1623
01:07:04,603 --> 01:07:05,855
I voted for you.

1624
01:07:05,938 --> 01:07:07,356
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

1625
01:07:08,065 --> 01:07:09,108
Who'd you vote for?

1626
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:12,278
My three guys?

1627
01:07:12,361 --> 01:07:13,738
You could pick three?

1628
01:07:13,821 --> 01:07:18,200
No, we can't pick three people, but, like,
are you curious about who I voted for?

1629
01:07:18,284 --> 01:07:20,244
[whimsical music playing]

1630
01:07:20,327 --> 01:07:21,954
The person I voted for?

1631
01:07:22,038 --> 01:07:25,291
-No, are you asking who I voted for? Yeah.
-Oh, what do I wanna know about you?

1632
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:26,876
I guess, the three guys.

1633
01:07:26,959 --> 01:07:29,003
-Yeah, which three?
-Which three?

1634
01:07:29,962 --> 01:07:33,716
I picked Sang-ho, Hyun-kyu, and you.

1635
01:07:33,799 --> 01:07:35,885
-Oh, that's good.
-Yeah. What is this?

1636
01:07:35,968 --> 01:07:38,304
-Good. I thought I wasn't one of them.
-Well, yeah…

1637
01:07:38,387 --> 01:07:40,890
-Phew. So I have a chance.
-[Car] Seung-li was on her list too.

1638
01:07:40,973 --> 01:07:42,183
-Seung-li too.
-[Eun-ji] Ah.

1639
01:07:42,266 --> 01:07:45,352
Jeez, tonight's Eternal Singles' Night
is a smash hit.

[enchanting music playing]

1641
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:49,940
But I've been wanting to talk to you too.

1642
01:07:50,608 --> 01:07:52,860
-Yeah, we didn't have a chance, right?
-Yeah, but… Right.

1643
01:07:52,943 --> 01:07:55,279
-I've really wanted to talk to you too.
-Right.

1644
01:07:55,362 --> 01:07:57,948
There didn't seem to be a chance,
so I felt disappointed.

1645
01:07:59,950 --> 01:08:03,370
So, actually,
I was gonna write and send you a letter,

1646
01:08:03,454 --> 01:08:05,956
because just thinking about it on my own

1647
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:08,334
-would be just a waste of time.
-Hmm. Yeah, right.

1648
01:08:08,417 --> 01:08:09,835
I felt sad about that, so…

1649
01:08:11,670 --> 01:08:13,631
-So I wanted to give it to you.
-Oh, really?

1650
01:08:13,714 --> 01:08:15,216
-Just to say we should talk.
-Okay.

1651
01:08:15,299 --> 01:08:18,928
Nothing big. Just…
just read it later when you want to.

1652
01:08:19,887 --> 01:08:22,890
-I just… I just wrote that we should talk.
-Oh, really? A letter…

1653
01:08:22,973 --> 01:08:24,892
-Oh, really?
-[upbeat music playing]

1654
01:08:24,975 --> 01:08:26,102
Wow, thank you.

Thank you.

-Yeah.

01:08:30,231 --> 01:08:33,442
…we got some time to talk like this today.

1658
01:08:34,485 --> 01:08:35,653
[gasps]

1659
01:08:35,736 --> 01:08:37,822
He didn't even know
if Ji-su would come or not,

1660
01:08:37,905 --> 01:08:39,198
but he prepared this beforehand.

1661
01:08:39,281 --> 01:08:41,742
-Wow.
-This is absolutely what Ji-su loves.

1662
01:08:41,826 --> 01:08:44,703
She kept saying she likes people
who express themselves honestly.

1663
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:46,372
-Right.
-She wanted someone to tell her

1664
01:08:46,455 --> 01:08:48,249
-that they liked her.
-That's right.

1665
01:08:48,332 --> 01:08:50,543
Sang-ho and Hyun-kyu
were both kind of halfway there.

1666
01:08:50,626 --> 01:08:51,752
Right.

1667
01:08:51,836 --> 01:08:54,213
And they usually put the letters
in each other's mailbox,

1668
01:08:54,296 --> 01:08:55,881
but it's so nice to get it in person.

1669
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:59,009
And did you see her face?
Ji-su was so surprised.

1670
01:08:59,093 --> 01:09:01,303
-[Car] Right.
-Yeah, I know. Her heart skipped a beat.

1671
01:09:01,387 --> 01:09:02,721
Wow, Seung-li is so cool.

1672
01:09:02,805 --> 01:09:04,098
[Han-na] That's nice.

1673
01:09:04,181 --> 01:09:05,307
[Seung-li exhales]

1674
01:09:05,391 --> 01:09:07,560
I was so thankful. Really.

1675
01:09:07,643 --> 01:09:10,646
I've mentioned that someone
who clearly expresses

1676
01:09:10,729 --> 01:09:12,940
his likes and dislikes is my ideal type.

1677
01:09:13,858 --> 01:09:16,652
And that was the most direct expression.

1678
01:09:16,735 --> 01:09:18,112
That was my ideal.

1679
01:09:18,195 --> 01:09:20,239
So, I thought he was really cool.

1680
01:09:20,322 --> 01:09:21,949
3 HOURS EARLIER

1681
01:09:22,032 --> 01:09:22,950
[exhales]

1682
01:09:23,742 --> 01:09:24,910
[sighs]

1683
01:09:28,914 --> 01:09:33,544
"Hello, I tend to be kind of introverted,
so I was wondering how to approach you."

1684
01:09:34,211 --> 01:09:35,045
[groans]

1685
01:09:35,129 --> 01:09:37,256
[Han-na] I guess
he kept writing and rewriting it.

1686
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:39,925
I feel like I've wasted my time
on other things.

1687
01:09:40,509 --> 01:09:44,388
And if I don't express myself now,
we might just end up friends,

1688
01:09:44,471 --> 01:09:47,016
or I might lose her to a competitor.

1689
01:09:47,099 --> 01:09:49,101
So thinking about that,

1690
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:51,770
I just worked up my courage
and went for it.

1691
01:09:52,771 --> 01:09:55,191
-Doesn't that give you butterflies too?
-Yes, totally.

1692
01:09:57,026 --> 01:09:59,486
I'm not very outgoing, so I…

1693
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:02,281
I tend to be very outgoing with guys only.

1694
01:10:02,364 --> 01:10:04,700
-But I just can't seem to approach girls.
-Why?

1695
01:10:05,242 --> 01:10:08,370
I get shy. I worry I might make a mistake.

1696
01:10:08,454 --> 01:10:12,082
I don't think you have to feel that way,
because this is new for all of us here.

1697
01:10:12,166 --> 01:10:14,376
I think they'd all
understand your mistakes.

1698
01:10:14,460 --> 01:10:16,921
And I'd be grateful if you made a mistake.

1699
01:10:17,004 --> 01:10:18,297
-Oh, really?
-I'm so grateful

1700
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:20,341
-for this letter right now too.
-That's a relief.

1701
01:10:20,424 --> 01:10:22,843
I was worried
that it might be too much pressure.

1702
01:10:23,594 --> 01:10:25,804
Why? I'm just grateful to receive it.

1703
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:28,015
We know how much courage this takes.

1704
01:10:28,098 --> 01:10:31,852
Oh, thank you for saying that,
and for understanding me.

1705
01:10:31,936 --> 01:10:33,938
-[enchanting music playing]
-Still…

1706
01:10:34,021 --> 01:10:37,316
Oh… Well, try not to go to bed too early.

1707
01:10:37,399 --> 01:10:38,943
-[laughs]
-Let's talk…

1708
01:10:39,026 --> 01:10:41,695
-Let's talk, get to know each other.
-Don't go to bed early? Okay.

1709
01:10:41,779 --> 01:10:43,656
-That would be nice.
-[cell phone chimes]

1710
01:10:43,739 --> 01:10:44,907
YOUR 15 MINUTES IS UP

1711
01:10:44,990 --> 01:10:47,076
The time flew by so fast.

1712
01:10:47,159 --> 01:10:48,160
It did.

1713
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:50,371
-That was too short.
-It was.

1714
01:10:50,454 --> 01:10:53,749
-Oh, but you should stop running.
-Why?

1715
01:10:53,832 --> 01:10:56,293
Stop running and save your energy.

1716
01:10:56,377 --> 01:10:59,296
My energy? Why?
But I stay up pretty late, Ji-su.

1717
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:01,090
I know. So show off everything you've got,

1718
01:11:01,173 --> 01:11:02,800
-like all of your charms…
-My charms?

1719
01:11:02,883 --> 01:11:04,051
…and pass out every night.

1720
01:11:04,134 --> 01:11:06,011
I think I wrote about that. My charms.

1721
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:07,763
-Oh, really? Okay.
-Read it in your room.

1722
01:11:07,846 --> 01:11:11,058
-[Han-na] That makes my heart flutter.
-[In-guk] He's cool until the very end.

1723
01:11:11,141 --> 01:11:13,477
-[Ji-su] Your charm. Got it.
-[Seung-li] Yeah.

1724
01:11:14,311 --> 01:11:15,646
-Get back safe.
-Thanks.

1725
01:11:15,729 --> 01:11:18,482
From Ji-su's perspective,
that was exactly what she wanted.

1726
01:11:18,565 --> 01:11:20,359
-That's her style.
-[Eun-ji] Totally.

1727
01:11:20,859 --> 01:11:24,154
[Seung-li] I think I expressed
everything I've been feeling.

1728
01:11:24,238 --> 01:11:27,491
But Hyun-kyu
was stuck to her side the whole time.

1729
01:11:29,201 --> 01:11:32,037
But, yeah, I'm sure I can steal her away.

1730
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:33,580
[Han-na] Oh, "I can steal her away."

1731
01:11:33,664 --> 01:11:35,082
-[music fades]
-[gasps softly]

1732
01:11:35,165 --> 01:11:37,626
Did he carry it around all day?
It's all crumpled.

1733
01:11:42,381 --> 01:11:43,465
[mellow music playing]

1734
01:11:43,549 --> 01:11:45,384
[Seung-li] "I tend to be very introverted,

1735
01:11:45,467 --> 01:11:48,846
so I don't think
I can approach you easily,

1736
01:11:48,929 --> 01:11:51,932
but I'm working up my courage
to write a letter to you."

1737
01:11:52,683 --> 01:11:55,185
"I hope you accept it with an open heart."

1738
01:11:56,228 --> 01:11:58,105
And next to that, I drew some stars,

1739
01:11:58,188 --> 01:12:00,733
because on the first
Eternal Singles' Night,

1740
01:12:00,816 --> 01:12:03,902
Ji-su asked me,
"Oh, do you see the stars?"

1741
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:06,488
So I wanted to reference
the first thing she said to me.

1742
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:08,699
-[Do] Oh, yeah.
-[Hyun-kyu] Like tongs.

1743
01:12:08,782 --> 01:12:10,701
-[Ji-yeon] That's cute.
-[Do] Oh, nice.

1744
01:12:10,784 --> 01:12:12,411
[indistinct chatter]

1745
01:12:12,494 --> 01:12:13,996
The stars are out.

1746
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:15,205
[Hyun-kyu] Oh, that's true.

1747
01:12:16,665 --> 01:12:17,499
[Seung-li] Where?

1748
01:12:17,583 --> 01:12:19,209
-[Yeo-myung] Yeah.
-[Ji-su] Over there.

1749
01:12:20,753 --> 01:12:22,713
[Seung-li] And at the end,
I wrote in Portuguese.

1750
01:12:22,796 --> 01:12:26,050
"Foi bom te conhecer aqui neste momento."

1751
01:12:26,133 --> 01:12:28,969
"I'm so happy to have met you here."
That's what I wrote.

1752
01:12:29,762 --> 01:12:32,097
Wow, this guy is so… He's seriously cool.

1753
01:12:32,181 --> 01:12:35,142
-What? He's such a romantic.
-I think these two will end up together.

1754
01:12:35,225 --> 01:12:38,354
-[Han-na] You think so? We have a couple?
-Yeah. These guys are set. They are.

1755
01:12:41,482 --> 01:12:44,234
[Ji-su] I thought that he was
such an impressive and brave person.

1756
01:12:44,318 --> 01:12:45,944
I felt so ashamed.

1757
01:12:46,570 --> 01:12:51,033
I was thinking, "Do I just like anyone
who talks to me right now?"

1758
01:12:51,116 --> 01:12:53,202
That thought crossed my mind.

1759
01:12:53,786 --> 01:12:56,830
Appearance-wise,
it's true that Sang-ho is my ideal type.

1760
01:12:56,914 --> 01:12:59,124
But personality-wise…

1761
01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:01,251
Just read it later when you want to.

1762
01:13:01,335 --> 01:13:02,669
Oh, really?

1763
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:06,340
[Ji-su] Seung-li actually
might be the closest one.

1764
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:11,178
But I think Hyun-kyu does make me feel
the most comfortable. So…

1765
01:13:12,179 --> 01:13:13,680
[chuckling] I'm just…

1766
01:13:13,764 --> 01:13:16,308
I'm just flirting with guys
left and right.

1767
01:13:16,392 --> 01:13:18,936
I'm doing what I hate the most.

1768
01:13:19,019 --> 01:13:20,562
YOUR CHOICE FOR A ONE-ON-ONE DATE?

1769
01:13:20,646 --> 01:13:21,855
A one-on-one date?

1770
01:13:22,439 --> 01:13:23,982
Who do I want to go with?

1771
01:13:24,066 --> 01:13:26,068
[chuckles] Mmm.

1772
01:13:26,735 --> 01:13:29,321
-[enthralling music playing]
-[inaudible]

1773
01:13:31,365 --> 01:13:33,909
Currently, my top choice is…

1774
01:13:33,992 --> 01:13:35,994
[enthralling music continues]
