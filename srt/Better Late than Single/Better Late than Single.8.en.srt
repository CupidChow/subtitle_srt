1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:08,466
-This is the day I've been waiting for.
-Wow.

2
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:09,426
It was so crazy.

3
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:11,511
-The fifth night was insane.
-[Eun-ji] Seriously.

4
00:00:11,594 --> 00:00:14,556
Last episode was like watching
three separate TV dramas.

5
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,057
-Yeah.
-[chuckles] I know.

6
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:18,852
Jeong-mok's top choice
had been Do from the beginning.

7
00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:21,271
-But then suddenly, on the fifth night…
-I know!

8
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:23,189
…he changed his choice to Ji-yeon.

9
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:25,859
Before now, these two girls,
who are roommates,

10
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:28,611
didn't have any issues
when it came to liking the same person.

11
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:31,781
But did you hear the way he spoke,
the tone of his voice towards the end?

12
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:33,616
-"I do." Wow!
-[Han-na] "I do."

13
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,660
-In such a low voice, "I do."
-[In-guk] "I do."

14
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:38,580
Actually, I think I use
that tone of voice a lot,

15
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:40,373
-like when…
-[laughs]

16
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:41,791
-…I'm acting in dramas.
-Really?

17
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,586
-For sure.
-Here, he's using that voice for real.

18
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:45,962
Like, actually for real.

19
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,882
But you know,
I really understand how Do feels.

20
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:51,259
She must be so anxious right now.

21
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:54,929
Up until this afternoon, she was saying
she was going all in for Jeong-mok.

22
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:58,016
-[In-guk] Yeah.
-But he's now paying attention to Ji-yeon.

23
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:01,978
He keeps eyeing her, and Do can plainly
see that he's interested in Ji-yeon.

24
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,980
Do must be so confused right now.

25
00:01:04,064 --> 00:01:05,899
Ugh, and why did they
have to be roommates?

26
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:07,442
In the beginning, they were like,

27
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:09,694
"It's great that we
don't like the same people."

28
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:10,945
[insects trilling]

29
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,114
-[Do] Is the…
-[Jeong-mok] Yeah?

30
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,366
-…person your heart is drawn to Ji-yeon?
-Yeah.

31
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:16,284
Yeah?

32
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:19,746
Yeah, she is.

33
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:23,416
[sighs]

34
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,543
Okay, I see.

35
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:26,920
Okay.

36
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:29,506
-I shouldn't have said that.
-Why not?

37
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:30,924
-Never mind.
-Why?

38
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:32,133
-Uh, nothing.
-Why?

39
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:34,928
I worry things might get awkward
between you and Ji-yeon.

40
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:38,139
-No, it's not gonna be weird between us.
-I shouldn't have told you.

41
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:39,766
No, it's not like that at all.

42
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:40,892
-Really?
-No.

43
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:46,147
-But are you upset?
-I'm not up…

44
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:48,024
[sighs] Upset?

45
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:54,989
Well, I'm obviously not ecstatic about it.

46
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:57,492
-[Jeong-mok] This isn't a great situation.
-Right, it's not.

47
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,328
Earlier, you told me that, like…

48
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,790
-You told me that you liked me the most.
-Mm-hmm.

49
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:04,916
-But…
-Right.

50
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:10,088
But the vibe that I was
getting from you later on…

51
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:12,757
-Right.
-…didn't feel that way.

52
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:14,008
[somber music playing]

53
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,344
-[sighs] Okay, well, what can I say?
-Um…

54
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:18,304
Why… Ah, this is so…

55
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:21,391
Of course, Ji-yeon is, like,

56
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:24,686
someone I feel comfortable with,
and I like her in that way, but…

57
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:25,937
[Jeong-mok inhales sharply]

58
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:29,566
She just seemed like she was having
a hard day today, and I just…

59
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:32,443
was noticing her, and so I just…

60
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:36,447
-From what I can tell, I don't think…
-Uh-huh.

61
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:38,032
…I'm your top choice anymore,

62
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:41,411
but you're only telling me I am
because you feel bad.

63
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:43,163
You think I like Ji-yeon more?

64
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:45,540
Yes. So, like…

65
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,084
[chuckling] Oh, man.

66
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,045
You're my top choice. You are.

67
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:54,924
[chuckles drily]

68
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:58,011
But if you really feel this way, I've…

69
00:02:58,094 --> 00:02:58,970
[inhales]

70
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:00,513
I've messed up.

71
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:01,806
-Yeah.
-I'm sorry.

72
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,058
-But why?
-Nothing.

73
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,728
-Don't keep saying you're sorry.
-It's because of me you're…

74
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:08,396
[solemn music playing]

75
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:09,856
Jeez, I feel bad again. Sorry.

76
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:11,316
-Why though?
-That's… What?

77
00:03:11,399 --> 00:03:14,068
[Eun-ji] Yeah, he's really
been apologizing a lot today.

78
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:16,362
[Car] And it's only
making her more anxious.

79
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,907
Mmm… But when you keep saying sorry

80
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,450
-and that you messed up…
-Yeah.

81
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:22,535
-…it makes me misunderstand you…
-Okay.

82
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,662
…and think,
"He must have had a change of heart

83
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:26,664
and that's why he feels bad."

84
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:29,083
-So…
-No, I just mean…

85
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:32,378
I'm sorry for making you feel
those kinds of emotions.

86
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:36,215
I know. But you said you liked me the most
when we were in the Lounge together,

87
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,468
but that you only cared for Ji-yeon.

88
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,887
I don't understand what you meant by that.

89
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,347
-Yeah.
-[chuckling]

90
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:47,268
So, yeah, that was why I thought,

91
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:50,730
"Oh, he obviously likes Ji-yeon the most."

92
00:03:51,356 --> 00:03:52,315
Right?

93
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:54,859
Anyway,

94
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:56,694
nothing changed.

95
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:58,363
-Okay.
-No change.

96
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:02,283
[music fades]

97
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,369
-I don't wanna confuse you.
-[chuckles softly]

98
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:07,080
I'm sorry.

99
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:09,582
[clicks tongue] I'll do better.

100
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:13,419
-No confusion.
-[chuckles]

101
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,631
I'm not gonna talk about this…

102
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:17,757
[Do] What?

103
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,969
I'm not gonna
talk about this stuff with Ji-yeon.

104
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:23,012
I won't say I care about her.

105
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,056
Oh…

106
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:25,974
I won't.

107
00:04:26,683 --> 00:04:28,226
-Okay.
-I won't say that.

108
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,104
Won't you regret it?

109
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:32,689
No.

110
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:35,191
Really?

111
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:37,819
Okay then.

112
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:40,488
I'm gonna try and focus more…

113
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:41,823
[inhales deeply]

114
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:42,740
…on you. [sighs]

115
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:45,326
[mellow music playing]

116
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,079
-And I'll do my best.
-Yeah.

117
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:51,374
-I don't wanna have any regrets…
-Mmm.

118
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,960
…when we get back to Seoul.

119
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:58,089
[Do] It felt like

120
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:00,925
I was being too clingy.

121
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,970
The tables may have turned,

122
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,306
but I have no regrets.

123
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:09,350
Yeah, of course, my interest in Do…

124
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:11,853
hasn't changed.

125
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:12,770
[music fades]

126
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:14,105
But this is…

127
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,399
[clicks tongue]

128
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:20,069
I'm not sure
how I should sort all this stuff out.

129
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,321
[inhales sharply]

130
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,114
[sighs] My emotions, I mean.

131
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,658
You cut your hand?

132
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,910
[Jeong-mok] Well, I'm not sure why,

133
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:30,872
but I guess Ji-yeon
just kept grabbing my attention.

134
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:35,084
-[Ji-yeon] Oh, thanks. I almost fell over.
-[Jeong-mok] Hey. Hey, hey.

135
00:05:35,793 --> 00:05:39,005
[Jeong-mok] I think I was paying
more attention to her than I realized,

136
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,299
and we started to talk more,

137
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:42,842
and I got to know her.

138
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:45,219
I actually wanted to do music.

139
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:46,971
-Oh, really?
-My parents were like…

140
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,639
-"Do it once you're in college."
-Right.

141
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:50,141
Mmm.

142
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:52,226
I… I totally understand,

143
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,312
-because my parents were against it too.
-Okay.

144
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:56,856
I didn't really have hobbies
since I worked part-time.

145
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,733
Yeah, they had this connection.

146
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:01,402
[Jeong-mok] It was just
so easy to talk to her.

147
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:04,697
It felt really comfortable and nice.

148
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,866
-[Ji-yeon chuckles]
-[mellow music playing]

149
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:10,703
[sighs] So, I can't really figure out,

150
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,539
like, what I should do, and it's just…

151
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,459
[sighs]

152
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:19,420
Ugh, that's what's so hard.

153
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,299
Mmm.

154
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:26,552
This must mean he's falling for her,
right? All this attention?

155
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:30,473
I think his brain
is sending him a signal… right now.

156
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,850
Yeah, paying extra attention
to someone implies

157
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:35,269
you're involuntarily
thinking about them a lot,

158
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:37,855
-and seeking them out.
-[Eun-ji] His heart is reaching for her.

159
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:41,109
And even though Jeong-mok
told Do that he'll focus on her,

160
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:44,237
and pay attention to her more,
his heart's still gonna be…

161
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:45,988
drawn to Ji-yeon.

162
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:50,493
Of course that won't change just because
he told Do that. We all know that.

163
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:51,410
[laughs]

164
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:54,747
-We've all had experiences like this.
-"We all know that." That's very true.

165
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:58,042
I can confidently say that all this is
gonna do is drive Jeong-mok even crazier.

166
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:00,169
-[Eun-ji] I'm about to go crazy too.
-[In-guk] Yup.

167
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,504
-[sighs]
-What would you do?

168
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,589
-In this situation?
-[Eun-ji and Han-na] Yeah.

169
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:06,926
If I'm like, "Hey, is Ji-yeon the person
you're most interested in?"

170
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:08,553
-"It is."
-[Eun-ji and In-guk laugh]

171
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:11,305
-Let's keep going. Keep going with this.
-It is.

172
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,307
But didn't you say
you wouldn't talk to her?

173
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:14,725
You'd focus on me instead?

174
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:15,768
[amusing music playing]

175
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:17,520
Hey, but we're all here together. How--

176
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:18,896
That sounds like Kim Sang-ho.

177
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,356
[all laughing]

178
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:24,193
But I think I'd act similarly.
I'd be confused like he is.

179
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,697
-[Ji-su] Ah, Jae-yun.
-Hey.

180
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,615
You gonna take Jeong-mok back?

181
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:32,118
Oh… I was on my… Yeah, right, Jeong-mok.

182
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:33,619
-You are?
-Yeah.

183
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,914
Hey, you look prettier
without your contacts.

184
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:39,542
-[Eun-ji] He seems worried.
-Yeah, don't wear them tomorrow.

185
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:40,668
[Jae-yun sighs]

186
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,172
-[Jae-yun sighs]
-[Ji-yeon laughs]

187
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:46,340
-[chuckles] We're tiring you out?
-Huh? No.

188
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,968
-I just have a lot on my mind today.
-[Ji-yeon chuckles]

189
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,720
-Why? What's up?
-Why?

190
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:52,680
It's just…

191
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,434
I was having a conversation, but I…

192
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,479
I didn't get the response I expected.

193
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:01,814
Oh, really?

194
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:04,066
We won't ask who it is,

195
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,402
-so just tell us what happened.
-Right.

196
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,614
-[Jae-yun] There's someone, A.
-[both] Okay.

197
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:11,407
-Are you A?
-[Jae-yun] Hang on. No, okay.

198
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,284
-So, first there's me.
-[Ji-su] Okay.

199
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:16,287
-I heard something while I was talking to…
-[Ji-su] Yeah.

200
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,914
-…to B.
-[Ji-su] Okay.

201
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,666
Wait, who was A again? Oh, hang on.

202
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,792
What?

203
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:22,919
Were you drinking?

204
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:26,547
Wait, hasn't it… But it's been a while
since you last drank, right?

205
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:29,717
-Okay, I'll just use names then.
-[Ji-yeon] Okay.

206
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:32,053
Yeah, I like Min-ji.

207
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:33,054
-Okay.
-"Min-ji"?

208
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:34,305
-"Min-ji"?
-It's a fake name.

209
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:36,057
-Oh, it's a fake name, okay.
-Right.

210
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:39,227
-Just tell them. Jeez.
-He likes… Su-ji.

211
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,270
-Are Min-ji and Su-ji different people?
-"Su-ji"?

212
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:43,105
-Or did the name change?
-[Jae-yun] Hang on.

213
00:08:43,814 --> 00:08:46,192
-I mean, Jae-yun…
-Why do you have to say it like this?

214
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:48,152
I think you can just tell them.

215
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,904
[laughs]

216
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:53,032
-[Jae-yun groans] Oh, I…
-[quirky music playing]

217
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:54,825
How many times have you changed the name?

218
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,369
-Oh, hang on.
-Just tell us.

219
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:57,703
Okay, just, Woman 1.

220
00:08:57,787 --> 00:08:59,038
Okay, I like Woman 1.

221
00:08:59,121 --> 00:08:59,956
Yeah.

222
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,374
But…

223
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,752
I haven't had many chances
to talk to Woman 1.

224
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:06,420
-[Ji-yeon] Okay.
-Not even once?

225
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:08,381
Just for a spot date.

226
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:09,799
-Oh…
-Okay.

227
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,217
[Jae-yun] That's it.

228
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,635
-What--
-Is it Yeo-myung?

229
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,387
[chuckles] No.

230
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,681
See? They'll figure it out right away.

231
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:18,432
[amusing music playing]

232
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:20,810
So, Woman A… I mean, Woman 1 is--

233
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,311
Just call her Yeo-myung.

234
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,771
[Ji-yeon] Yeah, seriously.

235
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:26,107
I asked her, like, "Is there someone…

236
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,316
[Ji-yeon] Yeah.

237
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,859
…you're especially interested in?"

238
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:31,237
-And when I asked…
-Yeah. Did she say yes?

239
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:34,198
I think she said that there was…

240
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:36,409
-[both] Mmm.
-There's someone.

241
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:38,953
But I thought it wasn't my place…

242
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:41,205
-[Ji-yeon] Not your place?
-…to pry into it.

243
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:44,250
Yeo-myung's just telling you
how she feels.

244
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,876
-But aside from that…
-[Ji-yeon] Right.

245
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,878
… if you're interested in Yeo-myung…

246
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,590
-Then let her know.
-…you should say how you feel.

247
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:54,176
-Expressing how you feel is good.
-[Ji-yeon] Right.

248
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,263
Just ruminating over it…

249
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:58,556
-Right.
-…won't solve anything.

250
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:01,267
-Yeah, I think so too.
-[Han-na] I'm glad she said that.

251
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,853
-[Ji-yeon] Go tell her how you feel.
-[Ji-su] Yeah.

252
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:04,770
[Ji-yeon] Do it.

253
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:08,149
Stay true to your feelings.
Just go for it.

254
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,944
[Ji-su] Don't think
about anything else, just do it.

255
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,446
[Jae-yun] Yeo-myung…

256
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,157
But I've already screwed it up. I…

257
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,867
I said something weird.

258
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:20,453
[Ji-su] Well, how weird was it?
Let's hear it.

259
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:23,873
I said that some parts
of what I told her before

260
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,082
were exaggerated,

261
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:28,002
and that I wasn't
actually interested in her.

262
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,296
Why'd you say that?

263
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:34,967
I just worried I had made her
uncomfortable because of what I'd said.

264
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:37,970
-But--
-[Ji-su] But if it was me,

265
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:41,599
I wouldn't be uncomfortable
about someone liking me.

266
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:44,226
It's more uncomfortable to hear,
"That was just a joke."

267
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,562
-That's very true. Well said, Ji-su.
-[Jae-yun] So…

268
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:47,521
[Han-na] Jeez.

269
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:50,024
So, do you want to correct what you said?

270
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,693
-[Jae-yun] Yeah, I do.
-[Ji-su] Right?

271
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:55,112
-Then chin up a bit, okay?
-[Jae-yun] Yeah.

272
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,657
-Yeah, you can practice saying it… here.
-[Jae-yun] Practice.

273
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,575
Okay, this is Yeo-myung. Good.

274
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:01,952
Yeo-myung.

275
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:04,914
-[Ji-su] Yes.
-[high-pitched] Huh? What?

276
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,290
[both chuckle]

277
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:08,876
-Come on. I'm doing my best.
-Then just talk like a guy. Yeah.

278
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:09,960
Okay.

279
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:13,130
Actually, what I said to you earlier…

280
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,966
I thought you'd made up your mind
about who you liked.

281
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,093
[Hyun-kyu] Yeah.

282
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:20,012
I wanted you to be happy with that person.

283
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,806
So, I said something…

284
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:24,767
Why are you talking like you've been
dating her for eight years?

285
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,018
-[Eun-ji laughs]
-Oh…

286
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,854
-Treating him like a kindergartener.
-[Han-na] Yeah.

287
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,356
[whimsical music playing]

288
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:32,566
Go and get a sheet of paper and a pen.

289
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,027
[Eun-ji] Yes, if it's hard to say it,
put it down on paper.

290
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:38,072
-Well, I did write something too.
-No, write it again now.

291
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:39,698
I wrote quite a lot though.

292
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:41,659
No, I bet it was a bunch of nonsense.

293
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:43,577
Well, I really did write a lot.

294
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,746
No, no, from what you just said,

295
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,958
I bet you're like, "There are so many
better guys, and I wish you happiness."

296
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,751
-I don't need to see it.
-[exhales]

297
00:11:52,962 --> 00:11:55,256
-Thank you. Okay, thanks, Hyun-kyu.
-Here.

298
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:56,549
-Sit down.
-[Hyun-kyu] Why?

299
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,509
-Oh…
-I was just going to go clean up.

300
00:11:58,592 --> 00:11:59,427
No, no don't write.

301
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:02,721
If you're nervous, it might not
come out the way that you practiced.

302
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:05,141
"Yeo-myung, I prepared to say more,

303
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,852
but I think I may not
have made myself clear,

304
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:09,895
because I was nervous.

305
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:12,148
That's why I'm hoping
you read this letter."

306
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,692
Let's write something along those lines.

307
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:17,027
-[Eun-ji] There you go.
-All right.

308
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,406
-"Yeo-myung."
-[Ji-su] Yes, good. "Yeo-myung."

309
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:23,868
"I love you."

310
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:25,327
-What?
-No. [chuckles]

311
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:28,205
-No, not like that, you weirdo!
-[In-guk] That's not it!

312
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,665
[Car and Han-na laugh]

313
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,543
-[Eun-ji laughs]
-[amusing music playing]

314
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:34,003
No, take that out.

315
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:36,046
-You were joking, right?
-[Ji-su] Yeah.

316
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,174
-[Hyun-kyu] Start with "Yeo-myung."
-"Yeo-myung."

317
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,133
[Ji-su] Okay.

318
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:41,552
"Yeo-myung."

319
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,138
[music fades]

320
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:45,764
-But--
-Can you say it out loud?

321
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:47,266
I'm nervous for you.

322
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:51,479
"When we talked earlier,
I said I wasn't being serious,

323
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:53,397
but I was lying."

324
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:54,648
-Yeah…
-Is that okay?

325
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,525
-Yeah.
-[jaunty music playing]

326
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:59,236
"I hate myself so much right now."

327
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,405
Aren't you gonna say why?

328
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,157
Don't try to write so much.

329
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,951
Make this letter
just about getting your feelings across.

330
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:09,371
-Sorry, you should go and get some rest.
-You okay?

331
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,665
-I'll go after I work this out.
-[Hyun-kyu] Really?

332
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:15,002
[Ji-su] You'll have to rewrite it,
so just flip it over and write freely.

333
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:17,588
[music fades]

334
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:19,590
Hey.

335
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:21,634
-When I got a call…
-Hey, you're here.

336
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:24,678
-[Sang-ho] You're still dressed.
-[Yeo-myung] Aren't you uncomfortable?

337
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:27,848
[Jeong-mok] Huh? God,
I'm dying right now. Dying.

338
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:30,559
Hey, you can't die now.
You have to date before you die.

339
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,686
-You can't die.
-[Jeong-mok] So…

340
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:35,147
[Min-hong] Just bring
a shot glass and… Cheers.

341
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,900
So, I'm curious.

342
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:41,320
We took turns talking about our makeovers,

343
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:43,405
being totally honest.

344
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,407
And did we all get to talk? I…

345
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:48,244
-What do you mean?
-Like, about our makeovers.

346
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,537
-Makeover?
-[Ji-yeon] Yeah.

347
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,539
I think I said everything I could.

348
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,082
Yeah.

349
00:13:53,165 --> 00:13:53,999
[Ji-yeon] Mmm…

350
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,377
I'm honestly a little worried.

351
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:58,295
I'm…

352
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:00,756
Well…

353
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,593
People will eventually
find out everything,

354
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,428
like all the stuff I'm hiding.

355
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:10,432
I'm wondering if I should say…

356
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,810
-But that's entirely up to you.
-[Sang-ho] Right.

357
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,021
[Seung-li clears throat]

358
00:14:16,522 --> 00:14:17,648
[inhales]

359
00:14:17,731 --> 00:14:20,192
I'm kind of scared,
in case it ruins the mood.

360
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,653
Am I ruining the mood right now, already?

361
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:24,280
-No.
-[Yeo-myung] What? No, not at all.

362
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,281
[Ji-yeon] So…

363
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:29,743
Everyone had makeovers and got,
like, psychological counseling

364
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:30,953
-and stuff.
-[Min-hong] Yeah.

365
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:32,955
Well, so when I had counseling,

366
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:34,748
-I discussed my…
-[Min-hong] Yeah.

367
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:37,251
Well…

368
00:14:39,962 --> 00:14:41,672
My trauma, I guess you could say?

369
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:44,049
-I had counseling about that.
-[Min-hong] Yeah.

370
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:45,509
So…

371
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:48,137
I…

372
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:53,183
My mom, my older brother, the three of us…

373
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:57,229
So, okay, so my mom
raised my brother and me.

374
00:14:57,313 --> 00:15:00,190
She was the only one who took care of us.

375
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:01,984
What I mean is… [sighs]

376
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,444
Mmm…

377
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:06,238
My dad has always been
a really troubled person…

378
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,197
[Min-hong] Yeah.

379
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:08,866
…and he beat us a lot.

380
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,369
[soft somber music playing]

381
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:19,877
And that's why… I avoid men.

382
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:29,303
[music subsides]

383
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:31,639
Yeah.

384
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:32,848
[inhales sharply]

385
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,142
When I… [smacks lips]

386
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:36,226
…was a kid,

387
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:41,106
I didn't have the ideal father figure
that others have.

388
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,858
I grew up without that image.

389
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,280
[soft somber music resumes]

390
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,407
My father was kind of violent,

391
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,785
both verbally and physically.

392
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:55,329
I mean, he was really violent.

393
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:56,538
Mmm.

394
00:15:57,164 --> 00:16:01,126
After-school activities…
during high school…

395
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:04,630
I couldn't participate in that stuff,

396
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:08,550
and I always had to go home
in time for my mom to arrive.

397
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:09,635
Mmm.

398
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,347
And then, before my dad came home,

399
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:17,935
we'd lock the door, my mom and I,

400
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:22,773
and we stayed hidden
until my brother came home.

401
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:27,778
It was like that… pretty much
the whole time I was in school.

402
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:30,489
I saw my parents fighting and…

403
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:34,118
swearing at each other
and things like that.

404
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:37,830
So, I think I have a lot of fear.

405
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:40,374
That still takes
a lot of space in my heart.

406
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,670
If I hear a loud, blunt noise,

407
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:47,965
my senses become… really alert.

408
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,217
[inhales] And…

409
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:51,927
even if…

410
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:56,223
I'm close to someone, and, like,
they put their arm around me,

411
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:58,183
or joke with me, the…

412
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,811
the memories from childhood
come back in a flash,

413
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:04,189
and it makes me avoid contact
without meaning to.

414
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:06,191
I think I just feel uncomfortable.

415
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:09,611
[smacks lips]

416
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:16,952
[sighs]

417
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,287
[music fades]

418
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:21,165
-[Han-na] So that's why she's been single.
-[Car] Right.

419
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:26,920
[Ji-yeon] So before coming here,
I went to see a psychiatrist about this.

420
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:31,967
It seems to me that you have
a very strong will to get better

421
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,177
and to overcome everything

422
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,428
-you've been through.
-Yes.

423
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:37,222
There aren't very many people
who are able to do that.

424
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:39,141
[solemn music playing]

425
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:42,811
You say, "I want to get better
and live a better life."

426
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:45,314
That's a really brave thing to want.

427
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:46,690
From what I can see,

428
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:50,569
you have so much potential
because you're such a brave person.

429
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:53,572
[sniffles]

430
00:17:57,951 --> 00:18:02,289
[Ji-yeon] I think I realized so much
about myself after hearing her say that.

431
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:07,795
I never considered myself
a brave person, but… [inhales]

432
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,548
…she told me that, yeah, I actually am.

433
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:13,884
So… [sniffles]

434
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:16,762
I think that made me think… [inhales]

435
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:20,974
"Oh, I've actually been doing well."

436
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:27,689
My first priority
has always been my family.

437
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:32,152
That I should
take care of them any way I can.

438
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,863
I never really lived my own life.

439
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:38,784
I've never even
traveled abroad as an adult.

440
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,578
All I could do was study.

441
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:42,996
That's how I lived.

442
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:45,582
I never got to go on vacation.

443
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:49,336
Then I got this opportunity to come here.

444
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:55,300
And I'm so happy
that I've met people I can say this to.

445
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,929
We're all here for similar reasons.

446
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:00,889
I just wanted to tell you first.

447
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:04,810
-That's really tough.
-[Seung-li] Yeah.

448
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:08,480
But I feel so good letting it all out.

449
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:10,649
-[Yeo-myung] Oh!
-I feel at peace.

450
00:19:10,732 --> 00:19:13,026
[Min-hong] Good.
You did a great job talking about it.

451
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,653
-[Ji-yeon] Yeah.
-[Yeo-myung] You did.

452
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:16,697
I'm living a much better life now,

453
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,407
-so it's okay.
-[Min-hong] Yeah.

454
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:26,498
-Where are you going?
-Are you okay?

455
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,884
-Huh? What?
-[Yeo-myung] Come here.

456
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,306
Jeong-mok is tearing up.

457
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:44,808
[insects trilling]

458
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:49,188
[sighs]

459
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:55,569
[gentle music playing]

460
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:57,446
[Jeong-mok] I started getting emotional.

461
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,908
I thought,
"It must've been so hard for Ji-yeon."

462
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:02,576
That's all I could think about.

463
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,454
It made my heart ache for her.

464
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:09,666
I just didn't want you to feel weird.

465
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,211
-No, I don't feel that way.
-In case you guys thought,

466
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:15,047
"We were gonna find out anyway.
Why didn't she say anything earlier?"

467
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:18,050
-What was that, by the way? Just now?
-Huh? Uh, nothing.

468
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:23,680
You've come so far.

469
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,059
[gentle music continues]

470
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:28,143
[Sang-ho] Cheers to you.

471
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:31,438
-Did I make it too serious?
-What? No.

472
00:20:31,521 --> 00:20:33,523
-No, you didn't.
-[Yeo-myung] Don't worry about it.

473
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:34,858
[Sang-ho] I'm glad you told us.

474
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:37,569
-[Min-hong] Cheers.
-[Ji-yeon] We'll talk more later.

475
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:41,907
Wow, I'm so proud of Ji-yeon,
and I think they all reacted really well.

476
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,827
-Wait, what time is it, by the way?
-[Min-hong] It's 4:44.

477
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,829
-Really? Already?
-[Min-hong] Yeah.

478
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,623
-Let's take this…
-Oh, sorry.

479
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:50,540
It's fine.

480
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,965
But I'm really happy.

481
00:20:58,048 --> 00:21:00,300
-[Jeong-mok] Here…
-Jeong-mok, I'm jealous.

482
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:01,218
[Ji-yeon laughs]

483
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:03,929
-Oh, thank you.
-Jeong-mok, I'm so jealous right now.

484
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:07,516
-[Jeong-mok] Good night.
-[Ji-yeon] Bye. See you tomorrow.

485
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,309
She had a really rough upbringing.

486
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:13,021
-Her priorities are same as Jeong-mok's.
-[Eun-ji] Yeah, her top priorities.

487
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:16,275
I think that's gonna have
a very strong impact on Jeong-mok.

488
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:19,027
Jeong-mok related to that
on an emotional level.

489
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,237
[Eun-ji] Right.

490
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,698
-[groovy music playing]
-[birds chirping]

491
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:26,243
[Han-na] The sixth morning has arrived.

492
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:29,037
Come on, you guys.
When are you gonna go swimming?

493
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,330
[Car laughs]

494
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,416
I don't think they will.

495
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:33,709
Please go swimming.

496
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,544
-This is a waste of water.
-[Car laughs]

497
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:38,213
[Yeo-myung] Hey, I have a question.

498
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:41,466
So, usually Hyun-kyu
is kind of like a bulldozer,

499
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,303
where he's, like,
constantly trying to talk to you.

500
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:46,596
But is that because
you can't turn him down, or--

501
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,390
[Ji-su] I could turn him down if I wanted.

502
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:49,308
Oh, okay.

503
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:52,102
But I keep talking to Hyun-kyu
because when I tell him,

504
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:53,729
like, "This or that happened to me,"

505
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:56,231
Hyun-kyu always
listens really well and responds.

506
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,400
So I just feel comfortable with him.

507
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:02,321
But since Hyun-kyu is on
an emotional rollercoaster himself,

508
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:04,823
-I feel like I'm along for the ride.
-Oh…

509
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:07,409
But Seung-li goes,
"Oh, I see," and that's it.

510
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,244
So, they're totally different guys.

511
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,663
One of them gets deeper when I get deeper.

512
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:15,959
But the other one keeps going
at his own pace, even when I get deep.

513
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,795
This is so selfish of me to say,

514
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:22,299
but I wish Hyun-kyu's mind
was mixed with Seung-li's attitude.

515
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:24,426
That'd be the best combination.

516
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:25,844
She wants to combine them?

517
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:27,387
Oh, lots of people feel like that.

518
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:28,805
I don't usually think,

519
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,724
-"Do I really have to do this?"
-Right.

520
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:32,934
But if you have that thought
and still do it,

521
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,479
that's how you know
you have feelings for someone.

522
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:36,605
Oh…

523
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,607
But honestly, I'm thinking,

524
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,193
"Do I really have to
comfort Hyun-kyu?" But I still do.

525
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:42,486
Oh, okay.

526
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,072
I just feel like
I have to take care of him.

527
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:46,239
It's a maternal instinct.

528
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:48,408
-[Eun-ji] Yeah.
-Maternal instincts, okay.

529
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:52,079
It must be hard for you.
You must have a lot on your mind.

530
00:22:52,829 --> 00:22:54,873
She's not entirely uninterested.

531
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:57,709
-It's not like she doesn't like Hyun-kyu.
-She is interested.

532
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:59,586
-That's why she keeps hearing him out.
-Yeah.

533
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:01,254
-It's unexpected. Right.
-[Eun-ji] Yeah.

534
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:04,007
[Jae-yun sighs heavily]

535
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:06,468
Did Jae-yun write the letter?

536
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:09,262
-Oh, the cologne.
-[In-guk chuckles] He sprayed some.

537
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:11,348
[whimsical music playing]

538
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:14,935
[sniffs]

539
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:19,397
[knocks on door]

540
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:21,024
[Yeo-myung] What? What?

541
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:23,110
[Jae-yun] Hey, can we talk for a minute?

542
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:24,694
Oh, is he giving it to her in person?

543
00:23:24,778 --> 00:23:26,696
-Jae-yun's gotten better at this.
-[Jae-yun] So…

544
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,865
I hope he really expresses himself fully.

545
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,700
-[Eun-ji] Please.
-[Han-na] Please.

546
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,119
[music fades]

547
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:34,162
[Jae-yun] So, I'll just say this first.

548
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:38,250
When I said
I wasn't interested in you yesterday…

549
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,167
[Yeo-myung] Hmm.

550
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:41,253
-…that was a lie.
-Mmm.

551
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:43,922
-I thought you…
-Mmm.

552
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,884
-I thought you had already decided on…
-Mmm.

553
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:49,928
…one person.

554
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:55,183
So, I thought, "Did I interfere
in her relationship with that guy?"

555
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,143
[Yeo-myung] Yeah.

556
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:57,394
-I was…
-Yeah.

557
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:59,688
-…struggling with that,
-Yeah.

558
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,523
…and I thought

559
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:04,776
-it might be best for both of us…
-Okay.

560
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,319
…if I just gave up.

561
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:09,281
-That's why I said all that.
-Okay.

562
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,408
But the more I think about it,

563
00:24:12,576 --> 00:24:15,787
I feel stronger about
wanting to make things work with you

564
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:17,998
than I do about anything else.

565
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:24,754
But from my perspective,
it all happened in quick succession.

566
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:25,672
Yeah.

567
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:28,508
You kept telling me
once every few hours that,

568
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:30,677
"I like you." "I don't like you."

569
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,804
"No, but I actually do like you."

570
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:36,725
I don't know
how I'm supposed to take this.

571
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:39,477
You might come back
later in the evening and say,

572
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:42,147
"Actually, I don't have feelings for you."

573
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:44,691
That's how I'm perceiving this.

574
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,443
[Jae-yun] Mmm.

575
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,656
It makes sense
that you would feel that way.

576
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:55,911
But I was just worried
that I wouldn't get to express…

577
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:58,663
-Yeah.
-…all the things

578
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:01,917
that I wanted to tell you,
so I wrote you a letter.

579
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,876
[Yeo-myung] Yeah.

580
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:06,129
[Jae-yun] So, just… just read it…

581
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,382
-[Yeo-myung] Oh, okay.
-…when you feel comfortable.

582
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:16,765
Is there anything you want
to ask or tell me?

583
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:20,685
When I'm interested in someone,

584
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:24,189
it's not because
that person has a cool car

585
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:27,192
or a nice job or anything like that.

586
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:29,486
Instead, I tend to focus on things

587
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:33,531
like whether or not
I can talk to them comfortably,

588
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:35,200
stuff like that.

589
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:39,037
I don't really care about
little things all that much.

590
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:39,955
[Jae-yun] Yeah.

591
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:43,500
So I wish you wouldn't
worry too much about all that other stuff.

592
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:44,918
[Jae-yun] Okay.

593
00:25:45,543 --> 00:25:47,337
I hope you can just be confident.

594
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,881
Don't compare yourself
to the other people here.

595
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:51,675
[soft uplifting music playing]

596
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:53,343
I wanted to tell you that.

597
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:54,511
[object rattles]

598
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:57,055
[Jae-yun] Okay, thanks.

599
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:58,974
[Eun-ji] That's nice, Yeo-myung.

600
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:03,144
They worked out the misunderstanding,
and I think she bolstered his confidence.

601
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,229
[music fades]

602
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:10,485
What do you think he wrote?

603
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:17,033
[mellow piano music playing]

604
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:23,915
[Yeo-myung] There were
two full pages in the letter.

605
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:28,712
Something that stood out was,

606
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:33,258
he said that my smile
was like the sunshine in Jeju.

607
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:37,387
It was so sentimental and stuff.

608
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,055
Mmm…

609
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:42,183
So I was grateful,
but also kind of taken aback.

610
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:45,937
[Ji-su] How do you feel now?

611
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,772
[Eun-ji] Ji-su helped him
write that letter.

612
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,941
-[In-guk] Right.
-I was kind of surprised

613
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:51,985
to find out that his feelings for me

614
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:54,821
-are actually pretty deep.
-Mmm.

615
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:56,323
I didn't know that.

616
00:26:57,615 --> 00:26:58,908
It's weighing on me.

617
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:02,120
But that's not so bad.

618
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:06,374
Really? I should read it again.

619
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:10,170
See? Saying a simple thing like that
can have a huge effect.

620
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:12,464
-[Eun-ji] Right.
-She's gonna read it again.

621
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:13,381
[In-guk] Yeah.

622
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:16,343
[alarm chiming on cell phone]

623
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:18,928
-[Ji-yeon] Oh.
-[alarm stops]

624
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:20,138
What time is it?

625
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:21,639
I fell asleep. I slept here.

626
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:22,724
Wait, what?

627
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:24,559
I guess I fell asleep on the sofa.

628
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:26,227
[gasps]

629
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,021
I didn't even take off my makeup.

630
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:30,940
-[In-guk laughing] Ji-yeon!
-She didn't go to bed after drinking.

631
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:34,819
Ji-yeon is wearing the same clothes
as yesterday. Wow, Ji-yeon! [laughs]

632
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:37,030
-[Car laughs]
-[amusing music playing]

633
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:40,367
[Ji-yeon] Ugh, I'm still not fully sober.

634
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,118
[music fades]

635
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:44,329
[door creaks]

636
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:48,541
[door closes]

637
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,252
[pensive music playing]

638
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:54,381
[Do] I was nervous.

639
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:57,384
When I talked to Jeong-mok yesterday,

640
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:59,928
he seemed really confused.

641
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:04,557
And at the time, he clearly said
he was most interested in me,

642
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,978
but… it really didn't seem that way,

643
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:11,606
considering his behavior.

644
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:14,734
Oh, why did I do that?

645
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:18,154
I don't know.

646
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:21,199
[clicks tongue]

647
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:22,158
[music fades]

648
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:26,955
[knocking on door]

649
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:28,373
Who is it?

650
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:30,041
[light whimsical music playing]

651
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,334
Who's there?

652
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:34,796
Come see me if something's on your mind.

653
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:36,005
[Jae-yun] Mmm.

654
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,882
Okay, so if I knock on your door…

655
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,968
Actually, let's make a codeword.

656
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:41,177
"Give me a towel."

657
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:42,971
-"Towel?"
-Yeah, how does that sound?

658
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,472
-Okay.
-They're so cute.

659
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:45,890
They even made a codeword.

660
00:28:49,436 --> 00:28:50,270
[Min-hong] Oh.

661
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:52,439
-Do you have a rag… towel… towel?
-[Han-na] "Rag"?

662
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:53,523
[laughing]

663
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:56,443
-Rag? Oh, he almost said rag at first.
-He got confused. Yeah, a rag.

664
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:57,736
[laughing]

665
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:00,029
I mean, can he be any more awkward?

666
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:04,033
-And his voice just now too. "Rag… towel."
-[in deep voice] "Rag, rag, rag, towel."

667
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:05,118
[In-guk] He's so cute.

668
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:06,536
Jae-yun is so adorable.

669
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:10,540
-[Min-hong] Oh.
-Do you have a rag… towel… towel?

670
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:12,709
[Min-hong] A towel?
Let's go, I'll give you one.

671
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:13,752
[music ends]

672
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:15,545
[Jae-yun sighs heavily]

673
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:17,464
[Min-hong] Tell me.

674
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:18,673
[Jae-yun] Okay.

675
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,217
Before…

676
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:22,761
-[Min-hong] Yeah.
-…Jeong-mok…

677
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:25,180
[inhales]

678
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:27,474
…wasn't really sure who he liked, but…

679
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:30,101
But you have to hear this.
His top choice now…

680
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:31,060
Yeah.

681
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,106
…is Do.

682
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:37,484
-[Min-hong] Mmm.
-Oh…

683
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:40,153
And his second…

684
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,615
It changed to Ji-yeon.

685
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,867
-Ji-yeon?
-Yeah.

686
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,911
Ji-yeon? The Ji-yeon that I know?

687
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:50,288
-My friend Ji-yeon?
-Yeah.

688
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:51,831
Yeah.

689
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:53,917
[soft wistful music playing]

690
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:00,757
ONE HOUR EARLIER

691
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,966
NOH JAE-YUN
HA JEONG-MOK

692
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,552
[Jae-yun] How does she
compare to Min-hong?

693
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:07,347
[clicks tongue] Min-hong… [sighs]

694
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:13,019
I guess everyone thinks it's Min-hong.
My second choice.

695
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:14,354
What? Isn't she?

696
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:16,898
[Jeong-mok] No, she's not.

697
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:18,274
Well, after Do,

698
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:21,444
it was Min-hong,

699
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:23,947
but not now.

700
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:26,366
It's Ji-yeon.

701
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:27,909
-[Sang-ho] Mmm.
-[Jae-yun] Oh.

702
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:33,456
[Jae-yun breathes deeply]

703
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:37,836
[breathes deeply]

704
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:42,507
[Min-hong] I found out
that his second choice is Ji-yeon,

705
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:44,717
the person I'm closest to.

706
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:47,679
But it's not like
I hate Ji-yeon because of it.

707
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:52,350
I just like Jeong-mok
and I wish he'd go on dates with me too.

708
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:55,311
And my heart still flutters
whenever I see him.

709
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:57,272
But now…

710
00:30:57,355 --> 00:31:00,275
Oh, I'm just afraid
that he might lose interest.

711
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:02,819
[Jae-yun] Oh.

712
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:04,904
[wistful music continues]

713
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:13,580
[sighs]

714
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:14,539
[music fades]

715
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:17,166
He didn't really have to say that, did he?

716
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,335
-He could've told her if she asked…
-[Han-na] Yeah.

717
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:21,713
…but he didn't have to
tell her that unprompted.

718
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:23,464
-Hey, you gotta cool down.
-[laughing]

719
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:26,593
Hey. Don't do this.
Oh, she's getting too heated.

720
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:29,262
Damn, you're really,
really mad, aren't you?

721
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:31,055
-She's boiling right now.
-Oh, I know.

722
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:33,057
I started boiling over just now, huh?

723
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:35,685
I'm sure she
never expected it to be Ji-yeon.

724
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:37,562
-Like, "The Ji-yeon that I know?"
-Yeah.

725
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:39,314
-"My friend, Ji-yeon?"
-[Eun-ji] Yeah.

726
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:41,399
She checked several times.
[inhales sharply]

727
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:44,110
Ugh, I'm worried
this might hurt Min-hong again.

728
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:45,111
[Eun-ji] I know.

729
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:46,529
She might be very upset.

730
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:48,156
[cell phone chimes]

731
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:50,283
-[Seung-li] Huh?
-[Jeong-mok] "Healing Night."

732
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:53,202
[Yeo-myung] "Today's Eternal
Singles' Night is called Healing Night."

733
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:57,248
"A pool party has been prepared to soothe
the eternal singles' weary hearts."

734
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:59,042
-For real?
-[Han-na] It's a pool party!

735
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,752
-Hey, finally!
-Finally?!

736
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,463
-Sounds fun. Gonna be awesome.
-[Han-na] It does.

737
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:05,632
-I can't wait.
-They brought out the flamingo!

738
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:08,885
-The flamingo finally came out. God.
-[Seung-chan] Oh, is it lamb?

739
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:10,470
-[In-guk] Wow!
-[Eun-ji] That's right!

740
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:12,388
-No way.
-[Hyun-kyu] This is so cool.

741
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:14,390
-[upbeat music playing]
-[camera shutter clicks]

742
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:15,892
[Seung-chan] Hey, have a seat.

743
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:18,186
[music fades]

744
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,104
[indistinct chatter]

745
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:28,279
[whimsical music playing]

746
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,281
I'll sit here. [chuckles]

747
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:32,992
Yeah, they have to move quickly like that.

748
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:36,496
-[Min-hong] Oh, dear.
-You cold?

749
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:37,538
I have my jacket.

750
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:41,626
[Sang-ho] Yeah, kinda chilly.

751
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,544
[Ji-yeon] Jeez, it's cold.

752
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:45,254
[Hyun-kyu] I'll do the meat.

753
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:47,715
[Seung-chan] Should be good enough.

754
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,384
I'm gonna go grill meat.

755
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,427
I'll do it.

756
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:53,721
-He saved a spot.
-Ah.

757
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:56,808
Hey, let's put the meat on first.
We'll grill the meat first.

758
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:58,810
[playful music playing]

759
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:00,770
Just cook two of those at a time.

760
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:02,981
You're doing good.

761
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:04,524
[sizzling]

762
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:06,401
[music fades]

763
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:08,486
-Can we just sit here like this?
-[Ji-su] Guinness?

764
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:10,321
[Do] Oh, yeah, like Guinness…

765
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:12,991
Can I help with anything?

766
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:15,284
-No, it's fine. Sit.
-Really? Don't need help grilling?

767
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:19,205
[Car] Ji-yeon's actions
might not seem all that casual, right?

768
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:20,581
Should I go help?

769
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,251
-Go on.
-[Mi-ji] Ah…

770
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:25,878
-[Ji-su] What?
-[Seung-li] She's gonna help.

771
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:28,006
-You need help?
-[Ji-yeon] This one's too thick.

772
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:29,716
-But why?
-Oh, there's salt and pepper.

773
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:31,300
-Add them after it's done.
-Toss it?

774
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:32,260
Yeah.

775
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:35,555
-[Min-hong] Yeah, that one.
-Ji-yeon, are you cooking again?

776
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:37,640
Huh? What'd you say?

777
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:40,852
-Ji-yeon, is your finger better now?
-[Seung-chan] Okay. You can stop now.

778
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:44,313
-Please, sit. Can you sit down? Please?
-What? Oh, should I?

779
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:45,648
-We can take over.
-Okay.

780
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:46,983
[Hyun-kyu] Go talk and relax.

781
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:48,484
-[Jeong-mok] Have fun.
-It's no fun.

782
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:50,987
Hey, there's this strange kind of--

783
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,655
Yeah, the tension is really building.

784
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:54,949
-Do probably doesn't want her near him.
-[Eun-ji] Right.

785
00:33:58,369 --> 00:33:59,203
That's done.

786
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:00,913
[Min-hong] Yeah, you…

787
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:02,665
[whimsical music playing]

788
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:05,168
I always grill the meat
when I go out with friends.

789
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:06,711
-Really?
-Yep.

790
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:08,880
Well, I'm usually not the one to do it.

791
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:10,715
Everyone else is better at it.

792
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:13,801
-Hyun-kyu, wanna try one?
-Yeah.

793
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:16,179
-Let's try some here.
-Let's just eat here.

794
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,806
-You're still not done?
-No, it's all done.

795
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:21,517
-Leave that, come over to eat.
-Try it. See if it's fully cooked.

796
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:23,227
-[Jeong-mok] What?
-[giggles] No.

797
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,520
[Han-na] She's feeding him.

798
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:26,147
-[Min-hong] Kidding.
-Must not be done.

799
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,149
-[Jeong-mok] Not done yet.
-[Min-hong] Not done?

800
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,651
Yeah, it's fine.
Even if we eat this, it's…

801
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,196
-[Hyun-kyu] It's still cooking.
-Want some?

802
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:35,490
[Min-hong] Give it here.
Over here. They didn't get any.

803
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:39,160
-[Car] Wow, wow.
-They're battling to feed him right now.

804
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:41,204
-They both keep feeding him.
-Wow.

805
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:43,414
[tense music playing]

806
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:46,209
[Do] Apparently,
Jeong-mok is really popular.

807
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:49,045
He's getting on my nerves.

808
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:51,130
Min-hong's getting on my nerves.

809
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:53,341
Everyone's getting on my nerves right now.

810
00:34:53,424 --> 00:34:54,550
[music fades]

811
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:56,719
-Are you eating three pieces?
-No, that's how it was.

812
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:58,679
-[Ji-yeon] Oh, really?
-[indistinct chatter]

813
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:01,516
[Min-hong] Hey, Seung-li!

814
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:07,271
[jaunty music playing]

815
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:09,524
-Do too? Do is feeding him now too.
-[In-guk] Do.

816
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:12,485
-[Car] She won't back off.
-She isn't usually like this.

817
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:14,946
-Right, you don't like wasabi, do you?
-[Jeong-mok] What?

818
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:17,323
-[Do] You don't like it? No?
-[Sang-ho] No one wants it.

819
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:19,534
-Jeez, Jeong-mok.
-Wow.

820
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:21,744
-[Seung-chan] The smell…
-Oh, look at Min-hong's face.

821
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:23,079
[Car laughs]

822
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:25,081
Oh, this might get out of hand.

823
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:27,792
God, why does it feel so… so tense?

824
00:35:30,753 --> 00:35:32,463
[indistinct chatter]

825
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:34,423
[chuckling]

826
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:35,800
[Yeo-myung] Cute, cute.

827
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,136
[music fades]

828
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:39,387
[sizzling]

829
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,723
-Let me know if you need help.
-[Min-hong] Okay.

830
00:35:46,018 --> 00:35:47,103
[Seung-chan] Eat up and go.

831
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:52,233
-[Seung-li] This got a little cold. Yeah.
-Is it good? I'm gonna eat it anyway.

832
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:53,317
[Car] Oh, over here too.

833
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:55,611
-[In-guk] They're getting started again.
-[Han-na] Yeah.

834
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:57,697
[intense music playing]

835
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:00,575
[In-guk] God, this is stifling, seriously.

836
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:04,954
[Seung-li] Kang Hyun-kyu
kept bothering me.

837
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:07,415
Ji-su isn't 100% into me just yet,

838
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:12,128
so my competitive spirit
is in full force right now,

839
00:36:12,211 --> 00:36:13,629
trying to win her over.

840
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:16,757
So, yeah,
I keep feeling really competitive.

841
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:20,261
[Hyun-kyu] I think
I'm the underdog right now.

842
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:23,055
So I have to do my best
and put myself out there,

843
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,558
as long as I'm not
making her uncomfortable.

844
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:29,187
If I am making her uncomfortable,
I'd better stop.

845
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:32,356
-I can't give up though.
-[In-guk] I like his stance with this.

846
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,900
-[Han-na] Yeah.
-[Eun-ji] Yes.

847
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:35,193
[music fades]

848
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:38,029
I've eaten more today
than I have since I got here.

849
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:39,906
Do you eat well only after lots of sleep?

850
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:41,115
-Yeah.
-I feel that way.

851
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,283
I'm kind of worried.

852
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:44,911
I wonder if I'm being too sensitive
about other people

853
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:46,871
because I'm not getting enough sleep.

854
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:49,540
Am I being too sensitive?

855
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:50,499
No.

856
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:52,418
-No.
-[Han-na] The battle has begun.

857
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:54,837
-No, no, before now.
-[Hyun-kyu] Before now?

858
00:36:54,921 --> 00:36:57,715
-You're cool, don't worry.
-I never thought you were too sensitive.

859
00:36:58,424 --> 00:36:59,258
You seem cheerful.

860
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:03,095
Do I?

861
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:06,807
[intense music playing]

862
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,601
[Han-na] They keep looking at each other.

863
00:37:08,684 --> 00:37:10,436
-[Eun-ji] Oh!
-[Cupids exclaiming]

864
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:13,814
[indistinct chatter]

865
00:37:14,815 --> 00:37:17,318
I think it'll be perfect
for hanging out with friends…

866
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:18,986
-[cell phones chime]
-[Seung-chan] What?

867
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:19,987
What now?

868
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:23,991
[Seung-chan] "Once you're finished eating,
enjoy the pool party."

869
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:26,369
"The Suite will be open
throughout the party."

870
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:29,747
YOU CAN FREELY TEXT THE NAME
OF THE PERSON YOU WANT TO TALK WITH

871
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:33,876
[Seung-li] I think Hyun-kyu
might have applied.

872
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,504
Anyway, my goal today
was to leave her alone,

873
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:39,173
let her get comfortable,
and not to pressure her.

874
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:41,133
[gripping music playing]

875
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:45,346
[Do] Should I apply for the Suite or not?

876
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:48,766
[Jeong-mok] This one person
was on my mind all day long,

877
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:50,893
so I applied, thinking,

878
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,187
"This is a good opportunity."

879
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:55,815
He just said he applied.
Who do you think he picked?

880
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:59,568
-Then we can head over to the pool.
-[Yeo-myung] Sounds good.

881
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:03,364
-Success! This meal was a success.
-[laughter]

882
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:05,074
[upbeat music playing]

883
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:07,618
-[Do] Wow, this looks fun.
-[Yeo-myung] It looks super fun.

884
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:09,870
[contestants exclaiming]

885
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:12,290
Jeez, they're finally in the water.
About time.

886
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,502
-Ahhh!
-[Seung-chan] Oh, hey, hey, hey.

887
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:17,545
[laughter]

888
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:18,796
Jae-yun.

889
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:20,840
Was that a dolphin that just came up?

890
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:22,591
-[Eun-ji] Yeah.
-[laughs]

891
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:24,885
Let's go.

892
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,304
This thing's huge.

893
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:27,680
[Do] Hey!

894
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:28,639
[Jeong-mok] Oh, Jeez.

895
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,559
[lively chatter, laughter]

896
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:34,729
[Seung-li] Yeah, today was really fun.

897
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:38,316
It was great
to get to spend time with everyone.

898
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:39,942
[Yeo-myung] It was nice.

899
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:41,944
I really wanted to check out the pool,

900
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:45,072
so it was so fun to finally get to go in.

901
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,407
Today was Healing Night.

902
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:50,119
I didn't want to do anything
that would give me a headache today,

903
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:52,204
so this was perfect.

904
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:54,123
[lively chatter]

905
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:57,543
[Ji-yeon] I'm gonna
refill this with water.

906
00:38:57,626 --> 00:38:59,879
-[Jeong-mok] This is for the playground.
-[imperceptible]

907
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:02,048
Oh, this is fake. Oh, okay.

908
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:03,674
Is it fake? Really?

909
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:05,843
-It's supposed to--
-What is it?

910
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:07,470
-Oh, together again?
-This is fake too?

911
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:09,680
-The side…
-Yeah, it is. It's the part you push…

912
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:11,349
[indistinct chatter]

913
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:14,101
Wow. Hey!

914
00:39:15,102 --> 00:39:18,606
[Car] Oh, he definitely
isn't keeping that promise he made to Do.

915
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:21,108
-[soft music playing]
-[excited chatter]

916
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:24,153
Hey, why aren't you coming in?

917
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:25,863
-That was too weak.
-Aren't you swimming?

918
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:28,074
-I can't, I don't wanna catch a cold.
-[Do] What?

919
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:29,867
I keep coughing, I might be getting sick.

920
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:32,620
-You are? Oh, really?
-[Jeong-mok] Yeah, I don't wanna get sick.

921
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:35,581
Take some medicine. Some Tylenol.

922
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:37,208
[indistinct chatter]

923
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:44,757
-[Eun-ji] What is this? What?
-[In-guk] Huh? What?

924
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:46,175
-What?
-[Han-na] What's going on?

925
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:47,259
[Yeo-myung] With makeup…

926
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:50,137
-Such a flirty gaze.
-Yeah, it is.

927
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,848
And he said something
so softly that no one could hear it,

928
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:54,892
-so Ji-yeon didn't understand.
-Wait, what?

929
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:56,602
-She slid over to him.
-She got close.

930
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:58,270
What?

931
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,064
SUITE

932
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:00,981
IN USE

933
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:02,608
[Eun-ji] The Suite must be open now.

934
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:05,152
-It's Ji-su.
-[Han-na and Car] Ji-su.

935
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,363
[enthralling music playing]

936
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:11,075
[Ji-su] I texted
both Hyun-kyu and Seung-li.

937
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:13,744
I finished my letter.

938
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:15,579
-[Jae-yun] Good luck.
-I'll be back.

939
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:21,752
[Hyun-kyu] When I got the invitation,
my heart literally skipped,

940
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:23,921
like it was exploding out of my chest.

941
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:28,676
[door lock beeps]

942
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:31,637
[Ji-su] Hello.

943

SUITE DATE
JI-SU & HYUN-KYU

944
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:34,849
What were you doing? Showering?

945
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:36,183
Yeah, I showered.

946
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:38,477
My goal today

947
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:41,480
was to try not to pressure you.

948
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:42,940
-Yeah. [chuckles]
-So…

949
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:48,404
I wanted to give you time to be alone,
so I tried to stay out of your sight.

950
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:50,698
-Oh, so it was--
-Oh, really?

951
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:53,033
You sure you stayed out of my sight?
I kept noticing you.

952
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,118
Really?

953
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:56,954
-Mmm.
-Yeah, so since…

954
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,206
I didn't get to talk to you,

955
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,958
-I was gonna write you a letter.
-Yeah.

956
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:02,668
So I was writing a letter.

957
00:41:02,751 --> 00:41:04,962
-Oh, you were writing this letter?
-Like…

958
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:07,214
"How was your day today?"

959
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:08,466
[mellow music playing]

960
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:10,926
"I'd like to know.
I had a peaceful and carefree day."

961
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:13,679
"You also looked more energized
after getting a good night's sleep,

962
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:14,805
and you were eating well.

963
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:17,183
Anyway, it was nice
to see you so laid-back."

964
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:19,268
"I don't know
what kind of day tomorrow will be,

965
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:21,812
but I hope you're able to relax
for the rest of today."

966
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,314
"I wish that with all my heart."

967
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:24,899
Mmm.

968
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:26,108
"That's all for now."

969
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:27,818
[Ji-su exclaims meltingly]

970
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:29,403
-[Hyun-kyu] That was it.
-Really?

971
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,362
Yeah.

972
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:33,574
To me, you're like a cute little brother.

973
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:35,534
But honestly,

974
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:39,747
I didn't think a cute guy
could be my type.

975
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:41,415
[Hyun-kyu] Mmm.

976
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:45,252
But I kept noticing you,
and there's that saying too…

977
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:48,422
"If you don't have to
do something for someone,

978
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:50,216
but you keep doing it anyway,

979
00:41:50,299 --> 00:41:52,718
that's the beginning of affection."

980
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:54,512
-There's a saying like that.
-Mmm.

981
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:58,641
And to be honest,
I really don't have to comfort you,

982
00:41:58,724 --> 00:41:59,808
-you know?
-Mmm.

983
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:04,271
Is this really the beginning of affection?
I want to find that out.

984
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,649
[Car] Oh,
she's expressing herself so boldly.

985
00:42:06,732 --> 00:42:08,275
So I wanted to ask you.

986
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:11,237
Are you curious about
how I've been feeling today?

987
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,780
[enthralling music playing]

988
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,323
-Yeah, I am.
-Really?

989
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:16,992
I… I always want to hear
your honest thoughts.

990
00:42:18,410 --> 00:42:19,328
[Hyun-kyu] Hmm.

991
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:23,207
Okay, so I think my heart was split 50-50

992
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:25,960
-between you and Seung-li.
-Yeah.

993
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:27,836
But now…

SUITE DATE
JI-SU & SEUNG-LI

995
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:36,720
Do you still feel unsure
of where your heart's at?

996
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:38,681
-Yeah.
-You're confused?

997
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:40,641
-Yeah, so… [sighs]
-Yeah.

998
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:42,351
…I asked you here.

999
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:43,310
Mmm.

1000
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:49,441
-I'm like, "Why does Hyun-kyu…
-Hmm.

1001
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:51,360
…keep grabbing my attention?"

1002
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:54,405
I don't really know why that is.

1003
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:57,741
Is it because he keeps coming up
and talking to me,

1004
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:03,831
or do I really have
some kind of affection for him?

1005
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:05,332
[low pensive music playing]

1006
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:06,917
Why does he grab my attention?

I don't know.

1008
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:13,173
But when he keeps going on and on,
when he's anxious,

1009
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:15,217
-I keep comforting him.
-Mmm.

1010
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:17,469
But honestly, I'm not that kind of person.

1011
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:19,763
Why are you doing that?

1012
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:22,016
I know, that's what I don't get.

1013
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:24,518
Am I just comforting him as a friend?

1014
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:28,981
Or am I comforting him because he's cute?

1015
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:31,191
-I'm not really sure.
-Hyun-kyu is cute?

1016
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:33,152
-I know, right?
-What part of him is cute?

1017
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:37,281
There's just a part of him
that's cute, like a little brother.

1018
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:39,825
But we're actually the same age.
So I'm not sure.

1019
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:42,953
When she was with Hyun-kyu,

1020
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:44,830
-she talked about Hyun-kyu.
-[Car] Right.

1021
00:43:44,913 --> 00:43:45,789
But with Seung-li,

1022
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:48,375
-she's not talking about Seung-li.
-She talks about Hyun-kyu.

1023
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:50,919
Man, that has to be hard
for Seung-li to hear.

1024
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:54,798
Then you should try talking to him more.

1025
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:56,717
-Like three or four hours isn't enough.
-Okay.

1026
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,303
Try talking to him more,
and you'll find out.

1027
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:00,888
-But are you okay?
-Yeah.

1028
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:03,265
-Doesn't that make you sad?
-I'm not that sad.

1029
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:05,100
Whatever you're feeling,

1030
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:08,270
it doesn't make me [inhales]
uncomfortable or anything.

1031
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:10,022
-I'm--
-Oh, really?

1032
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:12,024
No, I don't feel uncomfortable.

1033
00:44:12,107 --> 00:44:15,235
Why, do you think… Do I seem that way?
Do I look like I'm anxious?

1034
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:17,946
No, you don't seem anxious.
That's what's fascinating.

1035
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:19,823
One boy seems really anxious,

1036
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:21,825
and the other
doesn't seem that way at all.

1037
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:23,994
-Yeah.
-So, it's just kind of flabbergasting.

1038
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:25,996
Like, what? You're such polar opposites.

1039
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,456
-Right, we're opposites.
-Yeah.

1040
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:28,791
[mellow music playing]

1041
00:44:28,874 --> 00:44:31,669
Hyun-kyu is really forward in how he acts.

1042
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:34,546
But I can't really act like Hyun-kyu,
to be honest.

1043
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:37,424
Because I have my own way of doing things

1044
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:39,551
-and I'm… I just am who I am, you know?
-Yeah.

1045
00:44:40,135 --> 00:44:42,429
-I'm not in a rush.
-But I can really feel that about you…

1046
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:44,348
-Yeah.
-…and I appreciate it.

1047
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:45,599
-You do?
-Yeah.

1048
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:47,351
[Seung-li] Mmm.

1049
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:52,398
This situation is probably
really frustrating for you.

1050
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:54,733
-It's not too bad, but… Well--
-Right.

1051
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:59,321
I think I'll just come out and tell you
how I honestly feel now.

1052
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:01,782
-I wanna hear your honest thoughts.
-Yeah.

1053
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:02,991
-Honestly?
-Yeah.

1054
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:05,494
So,

1055
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:09,498
ever since yesterday,

1056
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:13,460
of the space I have within my heart,

1057
00:45:15,337 --> 00:45:17,631
you take up 70%,

1058
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:20,926
and Hyun-kyu takes up 30%.

1059
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:26,849
And honestly,
today, your portion grew to 80%,

1060
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:28,976
and Hyun-kyu is at 20.

1061
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:30,436
[enchanting music playing]

1062
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:33,021
When I start to lean
in a certain direction,

1063
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:34,565
it goes really fast.

1064
00:45:34,648 --> 00:45:35,983
-[In-guk] Wow!
-[Eun-ji] Wow!

1065
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:37,151
So…

1066
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:38,861
Oh, I feel so honored.

1067
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:40,863
I went from 70 to 80.

1068
00:45:41,530 --> 00:45:42,781
I'm really honored.

1069
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:43,949
-Oh, you are?
-Yeah.

1070
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:45,451
-[chuckles]
-I am, really.

1071
00:45:46,201 --> 00:45:47,828
[Seung-li] I felt really happy.

1072
00:45:47,911 --> 00:45:52,416
I think it was one of the happiest moments
I've had since coming to the resort.

1073
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:56,170
Mmm. I really appreciated
her telling me that.

1074
00:45:57,087 --> 00:46:01,216
I just jokingly said to her,
"I'm so honored."

1075
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:05,596
Since her feelings for me
weren't at 100% yet,

1076
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:09,850
I think I should be
more forward from now on.

1077
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:14,480
No matter what I say,
Seung-li's… cool with it.

1078
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:15,814
And I just…

1079
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:17,441
I really like that.

1080
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:22,070
My ideal type is someone
who can balance me out a bit

1081
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:25,741
when I'm too heated or feeling too low,

1082
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:29,244
and I think Seung-li
is that kind of person.

1083
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:34,416
-Look at his face. He looks great.
-Yeah, he looked so different from before.

1084
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,835
-Ji-su kinda needed someone like that.
-Right.

1085
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:40,172
-Someone stable.
-Someone stable, relaxed, not too serious,

1086
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:42,841
-someone who can create a nice atmosphere.
-[Eun-ji] Yeah, yeah.

1087
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:44,885
And Seung-li is good at waiting,

1088
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:47,054
-and being patient.
-[Eun-ji] He doesn't get jealous.

1089
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:50,724
But Hyun-kyu was more vocal
about giving her space.

1090
00:46:50,807 --> 00:46:52,184
-[Car] True.
-[Eun-ji] Right.

1091
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:54,102
-He wants acknowledgment.
-[Han-na] Right.

1092
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:57,397
I mean, I get it, it's nice to be
acknowledged by someone you like.

1093
00:46:57,481 --> 00:47:00,192
But when you start dating,
you fight over things like that.

1094
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:03,028
Right. The things you initially liked
always become the problem.

1095
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:04,947
-"Why are you so indifferent?"
-[laughs]

1096
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:07,783
-"Am I the only one who's mad?" Yeah.
-"Huh?" [laughs]

1097
00:47:07,866 --> 00:47:09,743
"Why are you so indifferent?
I can't stand it."

1098
00:47:09,826 --> 00:47:10,911
"Why don't you care more?"

1099
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:12,663
"Am I the only one who feels this way?"

1100
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:14,414
[Han-na] "Is this only a big deal to me?"

1101
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:15,541
[Han-na laughs]

1102
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:16,583
[Hyun-kyu] I wanna…

1103
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:18,377
I wanna hear you.

1104
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:20,629
Out of the space in my heart,

1105
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:24,091
-you and Seung-li took up 50% each.
-Okay.

1106
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:25,425
But then I said,

1107
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:30,305
"Right now, Seung-li takes up 70%
and you take up 30."

1108
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:31,348
Mmm.

1109
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:33,976
[Han-na] Oh, no, Hyun-kyu.

1110
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:39,314
-That's how I felt.
-Mm-hmm.

1111
00:47:40,732 --> 00:47:41,733
[clicks tongue]

1112
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:43,402
I see.

1113
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:46,613
-[Han-na] It's time to be honest, I guess.
-[Car] Of course.

1114
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:47,698
Mmm.

1115
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:51,285
I don't know what I should do.

1116
00:47:51,785 --> 00:47:53,912
[gentle wistful music playing]

1117
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:58,250
-I just--
-This is my first time dating too.

1118
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:02,254
It really is my… first time.

1119
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:03,672
-Mmm.
-I don't know.

1120
00:48:05,007 --> 00:48:06,049
[sighs]

1121
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:09,595
I don't know. I wanna seem reliable,

1122
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:13,140
but I don't know how to act that way.

1123
00:48:16,184 --> 00:48:17,311
To be honest,

1124
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:20,981
I did kind of give up today.

1125
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:25,319
I didn't want to pressure you, and I felt
that I was gonna see you too much.

1126
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:28,697
I did think, "Maybe she'll come to me."

1127
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:30,866
[gasps]

1128
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:31,908
Oh…

1129
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:34,202
She's not coming.

1130
00:48:34,286 --> 00:48:38,498
[Hyun-kyu] But you didn't,
so I kind of just gave up after that.

1131
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:41,460
Then when I got this invitation,

1132
00:48:41,543 --> 00:48:42,961
I was back in Heaven.

1133
00:48:43,045 --> 00:48:45,172
But then, after I thought about it…

1134
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:46,757
-[sighs]
-…I just…

1135
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:50,969
I started to get all… all worried again.

1136
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:55,057
Mmm. Mmm.

1137
00:48:57,559 --> 00:48:59,770
[Hyun-kyu] I was anxious
about being too late

1138
00:48:59,853 --> 00:49:02,064
and missing my chance with her.

1139
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:06,568
We don't have much time,
so I knew I had to hurry.

1140
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:09,613
-[Ji-su] You got a sec? Sure.
-Sure, you want to talk?

1141
00:49:09,696 --> 00:49:13,367
I want to do something more for you,
but I don't know.

1142
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:14,868
I'll give it a shot.

1143
00:49:14,951 --> 00:49:16,411
-You will?
-If you give me a chance.

1144
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:19,414
-You already met my family in your dream?
-No, it wasn't that formal.

1145
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:24,378
It's like her interest in me
was draining away, and I was just…

1146
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:25,921
[inhales deeply]

1147
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:28,256
trying frantically to stop the leakage.

1148
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:29,341
But actually,

1149
00:49:29,841 --> 00:49:31,009
dating isn't like studying.

1150
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:32,469
It's not just about effort.

1151
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:36,556
[inhales] I thought studying
was all there was to life.

1152
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:42,020
I'll still try my best until the end,

1153
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:44,731
reminding myself that

1154
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:47,317
I still have three days left.

1155
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:52,823
-Mmm.
-[cell phone chimes]

1156
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:55,325
YOUR DATE IN THE SUITE HAS ENDED

1157
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:57,661
[Ji-su] Wait, it says we have to leave.

1158
00:49:57,744 --> 00:49:58,787
SUITE

1159
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:01,289
Did you…

1160
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:05,669
show any interest in anyone else here?

1161
00:50:06,253 --> 00:50:07,462
[Hyun-kyu] No.

1162
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:09,423
-I didn't want to.
-Ah.

1163
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:11,800
You're my first, second, and third choice.

1164
00:50:11,883 --> 00:50:13,176
-So, it'd be meaningless…
-Right.

1165
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:14,970
…to show interest in someone else.

1166
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,681
That wouldn't be fair to them either.

1167
00:50:17,764 --> 00:50:21,560
You'd be attractive to me
if your cheeks were chubby or hollow,

1168
00:50:21,643 --> 00:50:23,270
it doesn't matter.

1169
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:24,855
I think you look nice now too.

1170
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:27,816
No matter how you look or what you say,

1171
00:50:27,899 --> 00:50:28,984
I'll still like you.

1172
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:31,027
You're just you. [inhales]

1173
00:50:31,653 --> 00:50:33,572
Anything you do is okay because it's you.

1174
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:36,408
I wanted to think about the future

1175
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:39,494
and become more reliable.

1176
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:41,580
[mellow solemn music playing]

1177
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:47,461
[insects trilling]

1178
00:50:47,544 --> 00:50:48,545
[music fades]

1179
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:53,717
I think that scene
really showed who Hyun-kyu is.

1180
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,510
-[sighs heavily]
-[Eun-ji] That was so…

1181
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:58,013
-When I met Hyun-kyu before,
-[Eun-ji] Yes.

1182
00:50:58,096 --> 00:51:01,516
I thought,
"Why didn't this handsome kid ever date?"

1183
00:51:01,600 --> 00:51:04,269
He said he really wanted
to go to medical school.

1184
00:51:04,352 --> 00:51:05,937
So he studied really hard,

1185
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:08,565
-and he didn't have time to date.
-[Han-na] I see.

1186
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:11,193
He did his best. The best that he could.

1187
00:51:11,276 --> 00:51:12,903
-[Eun-ji] Right.
-[Car] Yes.

1188
00:51:12,986 --> 00:51:15,405
He lives with the belief
that as long as you try your best,

1189
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:16,740
it'll be fine.

1190
00:51:16,823 --> 00:51:18,241
I think that's who he is.

1191
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:20,619
But when he said,
"But dating isn't like studying…"

1192
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:21,787
Yeah.

1193
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:23,705
-My heart broke for him.
-[Han-na] Mine too.

1194
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:26,166
-You can't succeed at love by studying.
-Exactly.

1195
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:29,127
-I think Hyun-kyu might've just learned…
-[Eun-ji] Yeah.

1196
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:31,338
-…a big life lesson.
-[Eun-ji] Exactly.

1197
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:33,507
[Do] It's just us now.

1198
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:35,967
You want a picture?

1199
00:51:37,093 --> 00:51:38,053
Do I look okay?

1200
00:51:38,136 --> 00:51:40,222
-You look handsome right now.
-Oh, really?

1201
00:51:40,305 --> 00:51:42,808
They're so close. Oh, my gosh!

1202
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:43,892
Too close.

1203
00:51:43,975 --> 00:51:45,101
Oh, come on.

1204
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:46,812
This is how you take a picture.

1205
00:51:53,026 --> 00:51:55,320
-See, this is how you take a picture.
-What are you doing?

1206
00:51:55,403 --> 00:51:57,489
-Oh, you're pretty good.
-We're taking pictures.

1207
00:51:57,572 --> 00:51:59,533
-Impressive, huh?
-[Do] I'll get out of the way.

1208
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:00,909
[Jeong-mok] Should I take one?

1209
00:52:00,992 --> 00:52:02,160
-[Ji-yeon] Okay.
-I wanna try.

1210
00:52:03,328 --> 00:52:06,790
Hey, halter tops look so good on you.
I'm jealous.

1211
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:08,333
I feel like I should cover up now.

1212
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:10,418
You must've worked out
your shoulders a lot.

1213
00:52:10,502 --> 00:52:12,087
Yeah, I wanna hide now.

1214
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:15,757
Hey, hey. You catch it.
Throw it, throw it. Throw it over here.

1215
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:20,095
-[Ji-yeon] Oh, nice. Good job.
-[Seung-chan] Oh, you're good.

1216
00:52:20,178 --> 00:52:22,389
-Oh, nice. Good job.
-[Seung-chan] Oh, you're good.

1217
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:24,599
-Oh, my gosh.
-[Do] Oh, again. Again!

1218
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:27,060
I think Do is trying
to get their attention.

1219
00:52:27,143 --> 00:52:28,770
Since those two keep talking.

1220
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:32,941
I'm a dolphin right now. [chuckles]
See? Aren't I exactly like a dolphin?

1221
00:52:33,441 --> 00:52:34,943
[Ji-yeon] What? A dolphin?

1222
00:52:35,443 --> 00:52:36,945
[Seung-chan] Ji-yeon! Nice shot!

1223
00:52:37,028 --> 00:52:38,238
Hey, I'm getting better.

1224
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:40,824
-[Ji-yeon] Good. Huh?
-I'm improving. Is there another tube?

1225
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:42,450
[quirky music playing]

1226
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:44,786
I don't know if this is a good comparison,

1227
00:52:44,870 --> 00:52:47,581
but it's like when you show
the second-oldest some attention…

1228
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:48,999
-Ah.
-…and the first-born goes,

1229
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:50,876
"Hey, Mom, look at this now! Look at me!"

1230
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:51,835
It's similar.

1231
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:53,587
-You're right.
-"Mom, look at this."

1232
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:56,131
"Mom, I can do a cartwheel."
Then they start doing cartwheels.

1233
00:52:56,214 --> 00:52:57,549
[laughing]

1234
00:52:57,632 --> 00:52:59,426
That's exactly what Do is doing.

1235
00:52:59,509 --> 00:53:01,636
I don't know
if it's a good comparison, but still.

1236
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:04,890
This is nice.
It feels like college orientation week.

1237
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:06,474
I never thought I'd go to one.

1238
00:53:06,558 --> 00:53:07,601
-Really?
-Yeah.

1239
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:09,352
-I didn't go either.
-[Jeong-mok] Really?

1240
00:53:09,436 --> 00:53:10,437
Why didn't you go?

1241
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,689
Do can't leave the pool right now.

1242
00:53:13,189 --> 00:53:15,233
She wants to stay close
to Jeong-mok somehow.

1243
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:17,694
Yeah, she's worried
about leaving them alone.

1244
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:19,696
-Oh, no.
-[Eun-ji] Oh, no.

1245
00:53:19,779 --> 00:53:22,699
-[Ji-yeon] I had that kind of experience.
-[Jeong-mok] Don't most people?

1246
00:53:22,782 --> 00:53:24,826
[Ji-yeon] But my school was…
No, last year…

1247
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:27,579
-[Do] What? Oh, no. I'm sorry.
-Oh, it's okay. It's okay.

1248
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:30,123
-What? Oh, no. I'm sorry.
-Oh, it's okay.

1249
00:53:30,206 --> 00:53:31,082
I really didn't mean…

1250
00:53:31,166 --> 00:53:33,835
-I'm really okay. I'm fine.
-[Do] I'm so sorry. I didn't know.

1251
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:36,880
-[Seung-chan] Let's use our words, guys.
-Oh, I'm so sorry.

1252
00:53:36,963 --> 00:53:39,341
[gripping music playing]

1253
00:53:46,097 --> 00:53:48,058
-[music fades]
-[indistinct chatter]

1254
00:53:48,141 --> 00:53:50,644
Everyone is gone, so you guys can go too.

1255
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:53,355
You can really go.

1256
00:53:53,438 --> 00:53:55,440
Why, I mean… Do, do you want to be alone?

1257
00:53:55,523 --> 00:53:58,151
No, but I don't want you
to stay out in the cold for me.

1258
00:53:58,234 --> 00:53:59,819
No, it's not cold. You're just wet.

1259
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:01,029
-Are you cold?
-We're fine.

1260
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:03,031
[Do] I'm not,
but everyone said they were cold.

1261
00:54:03,698 --> 00:54:05,700
[moody music playing]

1262
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,370
[indistinct chatter, coughing]

1263
00:54:09,162 --> 00:54:11,206
-It's windy.
-[Ji-yeon] Yeah.

1264
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:15,835
I should get that towel.

1265
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:21,675
[Do] You're cold?

1266
00:54:21,758 --> 00:54:24,010
Yeah, a little.
I'll be okay with this over me.

1267
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:25,762
Yeah, I'm fine.

1268
00:54:26,388 --> 00:54:27,430
Wanna go inside?

1269
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:29,683
-[Jeong-mok] If it's cold, go inside.
-No, it's okay.

1270
00:54:29,766 --> 00:54:31,685
-What? No, it's okay.
-You should… Why not?

1271
00:54:31,768 --> 00:54:33,478
[Eun-ji] Ji-yeon isn't leaving either.

1272
00:54:33,561 --> 00:54:35,814
[In-guk] Oh, look at Do's face right now.

1273
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:41,111
[Car] Oh, it's the start of a battle.

1274
00:54:43,822 --> 00:54:45,198
[Eun-ji] What should we do?

1275
00:54:45,281 --> 00:54:47,993
-God, watching those three is killing me.
-[Eun-ji] Me too.

1276
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:49,536
-I'm suffocating.
-I'm freaking out.

1277
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:53,039
Yeah, I apologize. I shouldn't have
told them to get in the pool. [laughs]

1278
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:56,459
-Yeah, what the hell? Why did you do that?
-[Han-na] Please get out now.

1279
00:54:57,168 --> 00:54:59,379
They're all gonna wake up
with colds tomorrow.

1280
00:54:59,462 --> 00:55:00,714
-[Han-na] Yeah, seriously.
-Yep.

1281
00:55:00,797 --> 00:55:03,883
-[laughs] I apologize.
-Yesterday, Jeong-mok definitely told Do,

1282
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:07,303
"I'm interested in Ji-yeon, but I'll try
not to cause confusion anymore."

1283
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:11,141
"I'll only focus on you from now on."
But he's not doing that at all, is he?

1284
00:55:11,224 --> 00:55:13,309
-Honestly, as Jeong-mok's mentor…
-Wow.

1285
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:15,854
…I have to say
that this behavior isn't okay.

1286
00:55:15,937 --> 00:55:19,024
I mean, it was really wrong of him
to promise Do something like that.

1287
00:55:19,107 --> 00:55:21,067
-Because…
-That was wrong. You're right.

1288
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:23,611
It's understandable
that he's confused about his own feelings.

1289
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:25,864
But he should've just said,
"I'm confused."

1290
00:55:25,947 --> 00:55:26,865
Instead, he said,

1291
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:30,076
"Okay, Do. I won't talk to the person
that you're worried about."

1292
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:30,994
[Eun-ji] Right.

1293
00:55:31,077 --> 00:55:34,039
That'll just make
the other person like him even more.

1294
00:55:34,122 --> 00:55:37,459
And now, the next day,
he's causing Do even more hurt.

1295
00:55:37,542 --> 00:55:40,628
-It does cause more hurt feelings.
-It's really not fair to her.

1296
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:43,214
-I would've done the same if I were Do.
-Yeah, me too.

1297
00:55:43,298 --> 00:55:46,593
Do may have accidentally hit the ball,
but I would've done it for real.

1298
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:47,886
While looking at her?

1299
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:51,598
If Eun-ji wanted to hit her hand,
she would've gone up and pulled her out.

1300
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:52,974
[all laughing]

1301
00:55:53,058 --> 00:55:54,142
"Come here. Come here."

1302
00:55:54,225 --> 00:55:57,270
I definitely might have done that.
It would've been bad.

1303
00:56:00,356 --> 00:56:01,775
[door lock beeping]

1304
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:04,069
[In-guk] That must be Yeo-myung.

1305
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:08,490
-[Yeo-myung] Oh.
-[In-guk] It is.

1306
00:56:08,573 --> 00:56:09,824
[Han-na] It's Yeo-myung.

1307
00:56:10,492 --> 00:56:11,659
Would you like some?

1308
00:56:12,368 --> 00:56:13,828
[mellow music playing]

1309
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:17,123
People kept telling me, "Jae-yun is cute,

1310
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:18,917
you should keep talking to him."

1311
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:22,337
"You might uncover
more things you like about him."

1312
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:26,508
So I thought, "Maybe I'll discover
a new side of Jae-yun

1313
00:56:26,591 --> 00:56:28,635
if we get a little bit closer."

1314
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:31,554
That's why
I accepted his invitation for a date.

1315
00:56:32,263 --> 00:56:33,181
Right.

1316
00:56:33,264 --> 00:56:35,391
Jae-yun is close to everyone
but Yeo-myung.

1317
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:36,476
He's close to Min-hong…

1318
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:38,436
-Right.
-…and he's comfortable with Ji-su.

1319
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:39,979
You know those jokes Jae-yun tells

1320
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:42,148
-when he's feeling… at ease?
-He's charming.

1321
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:45,443
Like, "Yeo-myung, I love you."
Things like that.

1322
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:47,237
I want him to do that with her.

1323
00:56:50,615 --> 00:56:51,866
-So…
-Yeah.

1324
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:54,119
Did you read the letter?

1325
00:56:54,202 --> 00:56:55,036
Yeah,

1326
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:56,412
I read it.

1327
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:58,623
[chuckles] Oh, really, you did? I…

1328
00:56:59,165 --> 00:57:01,459
-I worried it was too serious.
-Right.

1329
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:04,546
I thought, "Am I pressuring her too much?"

1330
00:57:04,629 --> 00:57:06,506
[Yeo-myung] Mmm…

1331
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:10,343
Right, it was really…
Let's clink our glasses first.

1332
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:12,137
[Han-na] He just drank…

1333
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:14,305
Hey, and they're turning away
out of politeness.

1334
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:16,683
-They're turning away.
-[Han-na] So cute.

1335
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:19,310
That letter was so serious.

1336
00:57:21,187 --> 00:57:23,731
That really surprised me, actually.

1337
00:57:23,815 --> 00:57:26,734
I could feel your sincerity
in the writing.

1338
00:57:27,902 --> 00:57:29,195
-[Jae-yun] Mmm.
-[smacks lips]

1339
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:30,822
Thank you for that. [chuckles softly]

1340
00:57:30,905 --> 00:57:32,657
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

1341
00:57:34,325 --> 00:57:36,161
So I wanted to ask, even if I…

1342
00:57:36,744 --> 00:57:37,745
Well…

1343
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:45,086
Even if I'm not interested
in you in that way,

1344
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:47,338
will you continue to…

1345
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:51,676
express your interest in me?

1346
00:57:51,759 --> 00:57:53,219
[soft mellow music playing]

1347
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:54,929
Because I don't really know yet.

1348
00:57:55,013 --> 00:57:55,972
[Jae-yun] Mmm.

1349
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:01,311
-[clears throat]
-Mmm.

1350
00:58:03,229 --> 00:58:04,397
I think that

1351
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:07,609
at least during the time that we're here,

1352
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:10,945
I'll express my interest,

1353
00:58:11,696 --> 00:58:13,406
up until the very last day.

1354
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:14,616
Mmm.

1355
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:16,034
I just feel like…

1356
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:18,536
that's what I need to do,

1357
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:20,413
you know,

1358
00:58:21,206 --> 00:58:22,582
so there are no regrets.

1359
00:58:27,462 --> 00:58:30,715
Is there anyone else
you're interested in, other than me?

1360
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:36,054
No, even from the beginning,

1361
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:39,933
I only ever wanted you.

1362
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:43,061
But I just… [sighs]

1363
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:47,607
wasn't brave enough
to express that clearly.

1364
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:58,076
Do you remember
roller skating on the first day?

1365
00:58:58,660 --> 00:58:59,536
[Yeo-myung] Yeah.

1366
00:59:00,036 --> 00:59:02,205
Like, you… you were really good.

1367
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:07,293
You were good,
so I tried hard to be good too.

1368
00:59:08,002 --> 00:59:12,090
I thought if I tried my hardest, then,
I might be able to get close to you,

1369
00:59:13,633 --> 00:59:14,884
to skate beside you.

1370
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:16,761
-Mmm.
-Yeah.

1371
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:20,515
[Yeo-myung] Smoothly.

1372
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:22,225
[Jae-yun] Smooth.

1373
00:59:22,308 --> 00:59:25,937
If you swing your arms like this,
I think it helps you skate better.

1374
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:27,939
[mellow music continues]

1375
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:30,900
[softly] Smoothly. Smoothly.

1376
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:35,321
[Yeo-myung] You were trying really hard.

1377
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:36,531
[music fades]

1378
00:59:36,614 --> 00:59:37,824
[chuckles]

1379
00:59:38,533 --> 00:59:39,826
Yeah, so…

1380
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:41,703
I…

1381
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:44,956
Right now, I still don't…

1382
00:59:45,707 --> 00:59:46,624
[Jae-yun] Yeah.

1383
00:59:47,333 --> 00:59:50,169
-…have feelings for you.
-Okay.

1384
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:55,633
And I really don't know
if I will develop feelings for you.

1385
00:59:55,717 --> 00:59:56,884
Mm-hmm.

1386
00:59:56,968 --> 00:59:59,012
When I meet someone,

1387
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:05,768
I care a lot about whether
they're easygoing and fun, like,

1388
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:08,271
-to talk to.
-Right.

1389
01:00:08,354 --> 01:00:12,525
But when I talk to you,
there are always awkward silences.

1390
01:00:13,401 --> 01:00:16,904
-Right, yeah, I… I know what you mean.
-That's why I'm not sure about it.

1391
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:20,742
Yeah, I guess
I didn't really think to, um, to…

1392
01:00:21,743 --> 01:00:24,662
talk about, like,
everyday, regular things.

1393
01:00:24,746 --> 01:00:26,664
-[cell phone chimes]
-It's just… Uh…

1394
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:31,169
YOUR DATE IN THE SUITE HAS ENDED

1395
01:00:31,252 --> 01:00:32,629
-Why are you--
-We gotta go.

1396
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:35,798
-[Han-na] Oh, wait. Are… are they just…
-[Eun-ji] Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1397
01:00:35,882 --> 01:00:37,967
-I mean, I get that it's over, but…
-[In-guk] What?

1398
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:39,218
EXTREMELY PUNCTUAL

1399
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:40,345
[laughs uproariously]

1400
01:00:40,428 --> 01:00:42,597
Time-out. Hey, Jae-yun.

1401
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:44,849
He's such a rule-follower. He's so strict.

1402
01:00:44,932 --> 01:00:46,017
He got up as soon as…

1403
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:48,936
-Hey, is there a fine if you're late?
-[laughing]

1404
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:50,980
Why is he doing that? Why is he like this?

1405
01:00:51,064 --> 01:00:52,982
Gosh, what do we do with him?

1406
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:55,193
-You know those massage chairs?
-He's like those?

1407
01:00:55,276 --> 01:00:58,196
You put in money,
and when the time's up, it just stops.

1408
01:00:58,279 --> 01:01:00,865
-Yeah. He… he's just like that.
-And just like that. Time-out.

1409
01:01:00,948 --> 01:01:03,409
All his life, Jae-yun cared so much about…

1410
01:01:03,493 --> 01:01:05,578
-…not inconveniencing other people…
-[Car] Oh, I see.

1411
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:09,123
…not breaking any rules,
and taking responsibility for himself.

1412
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:11,334
-[Han-na] He gets up…
-That's why he acts like that.

1413
01:01:11,417 --> 01:01:13,419
Normally, it goes,
"ding-dong," and then you'd say,

1414
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:16,089
"Oh, let's go when the time's up."
But it's, "ding-dong," and…

1415
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:17,757
-"Excuse me, I was talking…"
-Suddenly…

1416
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:20,551
Like Mazinger Z, the robot.
"Zing." Like that.

1417
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:24,347
He doesn't even need laws,
it's just automatic for him.

1418
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:25,640
[Do] I know.

1419
01:01:25,723 --> 01:01:28,059
[Do singing cheerfully]

1420
01:01:28,142 --> 01:01:29,977
SUITE DATE
JEONG-MOK & YI DO

1421
01:01:30,061 --> 01:01:31,062
This is nice.

1422
01:01:31,145 --> 01:01:32,230
[Do] Mmm.

1423
01:01:34,899 --> 01:01:37,193
-Why didn't you sign up?
-What?

1424
01:01:37,276 --> 01:01:39,195
-Why didn't you sign up?
-I…

1425
01:01:39,278 --> 01:01:41,823
I saw it… too late.

1426
01:01:42,573 --> 01:01:44,534
Oh, so Jeong-mok didn't invite Do?

1427
01:01:44,617 --> 01:01:46,285
Oh, so Do made the invite.

1428
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:48,204
[Han-na] Do invited him.

1429
01:01:48,287 --> 01:01:49,580
[pensive music playing]

1430
01:01:49,664 --> 01:01:51,332
[Do] I was going back and forth,

1431
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:54,961
but I didn't think
Jeong-mok would do it himself,

1432
01:01:55,044 --> 01:02:00,091
and since this is a good opportunity
to express my feelings,

1433
01:02:00,174 --> 01:02:01,592
I went ahead…

1434
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:03,678
and signed up.

1435
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:05,304
[music fades]

1436
01:02:06,013 --> 01:02:07,682
-I'd like to be the one…
-I… Yeah.

1437
01:02:07,765 --> 01:02:08,725
…to get invited too.

1438
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:10,935
[chuckles softly]

1439
01:02:11,018 --> 01:02:13,104
I wanna be the one to accept sometimes.

1440
01:02:13,938 --> 01:02:15,106
-[mutters]
-Sorry.

1441
01:02:18,317 --> 01:02:20,403
It's not like
you don't wanna be here, right?

1442
01:02:20,486 --> 01:02:21,320
No, no.

1443
01:02:23,197 --> 01:02:24,449
I… [clears throat]

1444
01:02:25,575 --> 01:02:27,285
-[exhales]
-I'm happy.

1445
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:31,914
I just wanted to make sure
you didn't feel forced to be here.

1446
01:02:33,708 --> 01:02:36,794
Jeong-mok does seem
a little avoidant right now.

1447
01:02:36,878 --> 01:02:38,713
-It's not like Jeong-mok.
-[In-guk] Yeah.

1448
01:02:38,796 --> 01:02:41,591
I think Jeong-mok
needs to be clear about things.

1449
01:02:43,009 --> 01:02:45,720
There really isn't… much time left.

1450
01:02:45,803 --> 01:02:48,139
How do you feel? Are you sad?

1451
01:02:49,182 --> 01:02:50,183
Are you happy?

1452
01:02:50,266 --> 01:02:52,310
-[smacks lips] No.
-Why not?

1453
01:02:54,061 --> 01:02:56,647
Just because I wonder
where things went wrong. [chuckles]

1454
01:03:00,985 --> 01:03:02,320
It's just so difficult.

1455
01:03:03,029 --> 01:03:06,407
[clicks tongue] It's better if you
don't drag out the rejection.

1456
01:03:06,491 --> 01:03:08,159
-Just do it. [chuckles softly]
-Yeah.

1457
01:03:08,242 --> 01:03:10,703
-It's painful if it's dragged out.
-Hmm.

1458
01:03:13,748 --> 01:03:14,749
[sighs] Hmm.

1459
01:03:17,668 --> 01:03:24,467
Obviously, what I want is for Jeong-mok
to be only interested in me.

1460
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:26,010
[gentle solemn music playing]

1461
01:03:26,093 --> 01:03:27,762
But if that's not the case,

1462
01:03:27,845 --> 01:03:29,680
if it's not gonna happen,

1463
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:31,599
I want to know soon.

1464
01:03:32,225 --> 01:03:37,355
I think being in this gray area
is a lot harder for me.

1465
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:40,024
Until last night,

1466
01:03:40,107 --> 01:03:42,276
I didn't really know how I felt.

1467
01:03:43,736 --> 01:03:46,614
And then, as I kept talking to Do…

1468
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:48,908
The more we talked,

1469
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:51,828
the more sure I was of my feelings.

1470
01:03:54,539 --> 01:03:55,623
[clicks tongue]

1471
01:03:55,706 --> 01:03:56,749
[sighs]

1472
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:58,084
[inhales sharply]

1473
01:04:00,002 --> 01:04:00,962
[music fades]

1474
01:04:11,389 --> 01:04:13,224
[Jeong-mok] Right. [inhales sharply]

1475
01:04:14,475 --> 01:04:19,063
I… haven't fully made up my mind yet.

1476
01:04:19,605 --> 01:04:20,898
-[Do] Yeah.
-[clicks tongue]

1477
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:22,733
[inhales sharply]

1478
01:04:22,817 --> 01:04:26,779
Well, honestly,
Ji-yeon is kind of on my mind.

1479
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:27,738
[Do] Yeah.

1480
01:04:27,822 --> 01:04:29,824
[gentle wistful music playing]

1481
01:04:34,453 --> 01:04:35,705
So I'm thinking about it.

1482
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:41,711
-I see.
-Yeah.

1483
01:04:45,339 --> 01:04:46,757
I'm just too popular.

1484
01:04:46,841 --> 01:04:48,134
[both chuckle]

1485
01:04:48,801 --> 01:04:49,802
What can I do?

1486
01:04:50,469 --> 01:04:52,889
Come on, she doesn't want to
hear jokes right now.

1487
01:04:52,972 --> 01:04:56,434
It's not the time for that.
That's not funny, don't say that.

1488
01:05:05,109 --> 01:05:06,819
[gulps, smacks lips]

1489
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:09,363
What do you want me to do?

1490
01:05:10,281 --> 01:05:11,574
[Jeong-mok sighs]

1491
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:14,076
Oh, I… well…

1492
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,119
[inhales sharply]

1493
01:05:16,662 --> 01:05:19,624
You don't need to do anything. Just…

1494
01:05:21,542 --> 01:05:24,045
-But I want to try if I can.
-Just… "To try"?

1495
01:05:24,712 --> 01:05:26,339
That's nice of you, but…

1496
01:05:27,256 --> 01:05:31,052
When it comes to feelings,
it's partially about trying, but…

1497
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:36,557
And…

1498
01:05:37,516 --> 01:05:38,893
You did more than enough.

1499
01:05:39,518 --> 01:05:41,729
[gentle melancholic music playing]

1500
01:05:41,812 --> 01:05:44,023
-[chuckles drily]
-Don't you think you did? No?

1501
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:46,651
-I… I think you did.
-That's very hard to hear.

1502
01:05:46,734 --> 01:05:48,861
-[cell phone chimes]
-We're out of time, right?

1503
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:49,820
[Jeong-mok] Yeah.

1504
01:05:49,904 --> 01:05:52,239
YOUR DATE IN THE SUITE HAS ENDED

1505
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:54,325
Yeah, go, uh… go on ahead.

1506
01:05:54,992 --> 01:05:56,535
He told her to go ahead.

1507
01:05:57,787 --> 01:05:59,330
-[Jeong-mok] See you later.
-Bye.

1508
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:05,836
[Han-na] What? What's this?

1509
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:06,837
[imperceptible]

1510
01:06:11,217 --> 01:06:13,594
[Car] Jeong-mok's still sitting there, so…

1511
01:06:13,678 --> 01:06:15,554
-[Han-na] Telling her to go ahead?
-[Car] Yeah.

1512
01:06:17,181 --> 01:06:18,349
[dramatic sting plays]

1513
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:21,185
-Did she stop?
-She stopped.

1514
01:06:22,395 --> 01:06:24,313
[door lock beeping]

1515
01:06:26,691 --> 01:06:28,693
[moody music playing]

1516
01:06:33,072 --> 01:06:34,949
-Yeah?
-[Ji-yeon] Oh, no.

1517
01:06:35,992 --> 01:06:37,201
Did you see her?

1518
01:07:02,226 --> 01:07:03,436
[door lock beeping]

1519
01:07:05,896 --> 01:07:07,273
-[door creaks]
-[sighs]

1520
01:07:08,649 --> 01:07:09,734
[sighs heavily]

1521
01:07:10,818 --> 01:07:12,194
[Do, tearfully] I'm really mad.

1522
01:07:13,070 --> 01:07:14,613
I'm curious to know

1523
01:07:15,197 --> 01:07:19,452
what exactly happened
that changed Jeong-mok's feelings.

1524
01:07:20,369 --> 01:07:21,537
If it was…

1525
01:07:22,371 --> 01:07:23,789
something I did.

1526
01:07:24,415 --> 01:07:25,541
[melancholic music playing]

1527
01:07:25,624 --> 01:07:28,586
If it was something I did, could I fix it?

1528
01:07:28,669 --> 01:07:30,337
Maybe I could, right?

1529
01:07:31,005 --> 01:07:31,922
[sobs]

1530
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:34,842
[chuckles emotionally]

1531
01:07:37,094 --> 01:07:39,388
[gasps, sobs]

1532
01:07:43,976 --> 01:07:46,103
[Do] He's such a jerk. Really.

1533
01:07:46,187 --> 01:07:47,980
[sobbing]

1534
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:54,070
[wailing]

1535
01:08:02,536 --> 01:08:03,954
I just keep thinking,

1536
01:08:04,038 --> 01:08:07,625
"There might still… [sniffles] be hope."

1537
01:08:10,127 --> 01:08:11,879
[sighs heavily]

1538
01:08:11,962 --> 01:08:14,840
Man, Do's feelings must be so hurt.

1539
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:17,718
They often blame themselves
in these situations.

1540
01:08:17,802 --> 01:08:20,346
Exactly. They could just say,
"Oh, we weren't a good match."

1541
01:08:20,429 --> 01:08:22,473
But instead, they wonder
what they did wrong.

1542
01:08:22,556 --> 01:08:25,434
[inhales deeply] Yeah,
when their feelings are…

1543
01:08:26,227 --> 01:08:29,146
not returned, when they're rejected,

1544
01:08:29,772 --> 01:08:32,858
you can see
what had been weighing on them.

1545
01:08:33,818 --> 01:08:38,364
And seeing them react that way
always makes me feel bad for them.

1546
01:08:38,447 --> 01:08:39,782
[Eun-ji] Exactly.

1547
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:42,159
-We're the last ones?
-What?

1548
01:08:42,243 --> 01:08:43,661
-Are we the last ones?
-I think so.

1549
01:08:43,744 --> 01:08:44,954
Really?

1550
01:08:46,872 --> 01:08:48,165
[Jeong-mok] To be honest,

1551
01:08:48,249 --> 01:08:51,210
I realized that I was
thinking about Ji-yeon all day yesterday.

1552
01:08:51,293 --> 01:08:53,420
Like, if she was being clumsy
or something,

1553
01:08:53,504 --> 01:08:55,589
I would suddenly want to take care of her.

1554
01:08:56,549 --> 01:08:57,800
Oh, Ji-yeon cut her hand?

1555
01:08:57,883 --> 01:08:59,385
-[Ji-yeon] What? Yeah.
-What happened?

1556
01:08:59,468 --> 01:09:01,637
-[Ji-yeon] I think the cut is pretty deep.
-Hey.

1557
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:02,888
[charming music playing]

1558
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:04,306
You're really bleeding. Let's go.

1559
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:05,432
I feel so bad for Ji-yeon.

1560
01:09:05,516 --> 01:09:07,560
-Why?
-She was really, really excited to eat.

1561
01:09:07,643 --> 01:09:09,478
Oh, I have to give Ji-yeon her tangerines.

1562
01:09:09,562 --> 01:09:11,355
-Wait, what about Ji-yeon?
-What?

1563
01:09:11,438 --> 01:09:14,316
I mean, she's been looking forward
to this meal since last night,

1564
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:16,152
-but now she can't have it.
-Oh, is that it?

1565
01:09:16,235 --> 01:09:17,778
-[Jeong-mok] It's to comfort her.
-Mmm.

1566
01:09:17,862 --> 01:09:19,989
I can't describe it in words.

1567
01:09:20,072 --> 01:09:21,699
I just… I got this feeling, like,

1568
01:09:21,782 --> 01:09:24,410
"I want to talk to Ji-yeon
and figure out how I feel.

1569
01:09:25,327 --> 01:09:27,580
I have the perfect chance to do that now."

1570
01:09:28,747 --> 01:09:30,833
-I wanted to talk to you.
-Oh, really?

1571
01:09:31,542 --> 01:09:33,002
-You picked me?
-Yeah.

1572
01:09:33,085 --> 01:09:34,420
Really? You picked me?

1573
01:09:34,503 --> 01:09:36,463
You came because I picked you.

1574
01:09:36,547 --> 01:09:37,464
-Really?
-Yeah.

1575
01:09:37,548 --> 01:09:39,091
You didn't get a text alert?

1576
01:09:40,050 --> 01:09:41,343
-You didn't?
-No.

1577
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:44,096
I came because I picked you.

1578
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:45,723
What? I didn't know.

1579
01:09:45,806 --> 01:09:47,433
-Ah.
-[Eun-ji] They asked for each other.

1580
01:09:47,516 --> 01:09:48,475
They chose each other.

1581
01:09:48,559 --> 01:09:49,643
-[In-guk] Mmm.
-[Eun-ji] Ah.

1582
01:09:49,727 --> 01:09:50,644
Mm-hmm.

1583
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:53,939
[music fades]

1584
01:09:54,607 --> 01:09:55,983
So, at first,

1585
01:09:56,609 --> 01:10:00,237
Do was my first impression pick,
but then after that, I was into you.

1586
01:10:00,321 --> 01:10:03,365
-Yeah.
-So, that's why I invited you today.

1587
01:10:05,576 --> 01:10:07,369
It's making me think.

1588
01:10:11,498 --> 01:10:12,541
How do you feel?

1589
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:13,959
Me?

1590
01:10:14,043 --> 01:10:15,336
-How do you feel?
-I…

1591
01:10:15,419 --> 01:10:19,006
Well, I did sense
that you were paying attention to me,

1592
01:10:19,089 --> 01:10:20,591
and caring for me.

1593
01:10:21,967 --> 01:10:25,262
And when… you kept joking around

1594
01:10:25,346 --> 01:10:28,599
and taking care of me, I also felt…

1595
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:31,936
To be honest… [chuckles softly]

1596
01:10:32,019 --> 01:10:36,232
it… gave me butterflies. Mmm.

1597
01:10:36,315 --> 01:10:38,275
[enchanting music playing]

1598
01:10:38,359 --> 01:10:39,526
[chuckles softly]

1599
01:10:39,610 --> 01:10:40,569
[Eun-ji exclaims]

1600
01:10:40,653 --> 01:10:43,364
I think I saw this smile
on Jeong-mok a few days ago.

1601
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:46,075
I mean, there isn't any reason

1602
01:10:46,158 --> 01:10:48,911
-not to cheer for them at this point.
-[Han-na] It's a cute smile.

1603
01:10:48,994 --> 01:10:50,621
-Jeong-mok seems really happy.
-Yeah.

1604
01:10:50,704 --> 01:10:54,166
It's that handsome guy smile again.
The one I mentioned before.

1605
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:56,126
[Han-na] It's such a gentle smile.

1606
01:10:56,210 --> 01:10:57,461
-Gosh!
-[Car] Wow, look at that.

1607
01:10:57,544 --> 01:11:00,089
So I'm just kind of confused right now.

1608
01:11:01,423 --> 01:11:03,592
[enchanting music continues]

1609
01:11:07,388 --> 01:11:09,473
[Han-na] Why are you
looking at her like that?

1610
01:11:09,556 --> 01:11:10,599
-What?
-[Eun-ji] Hey, hey!

1611
01:11:10,683 --> 01:11:12,351
-[Car] Wow.
-[Eun-ji] Are they gonna kiss?

1612
01:11:13,519 --> 01:11:14,436
[chuckles softly]

1613
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:15,938
-[Han-na] What, really?
-No…

1614
01:11:16,021 --> 01:11:17,064
Are they going to kiss?

1615
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:19,608
-What? [chuckles]
-[Jeong-mok] Nothing.

1616
01:11:21,777 --> 01:11:22,611
Me too.

1617
01:11:24,947 --> 01:11:26,615
You were always on my mind.

1618
01:11:27,866 --> 01:11:28,701
[Ji-yeon] Just…

1619
01:11:29,910 --> 01:11:31,078
as a friend?

1620
01:11:31,161 --> 01:11:33,330
-No, not just as a friend.
-Not as a friend?

1621
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:35,791
[Jeong-mok breathes deeply]

1622
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:40,629
That's why I didn't go in the pool.
'Cause you didn't.

1623
01:11:40,713 --> 01:11:42,298
-Really?
-Yeah.

1624
01:11:45,843 --> 01:11:47,386
[Jeong-mok breathes deeply]

1625
01:11:50,806 --> 01:11:52,474
[Han-na] Jeong-mok looks different.

1626
01:11:52,558 --> 01:11:54,059
When did you start…

1627
01:11:54,768 --> 01:11:56,937
-Hmm.
-…thinking about that?

1628
01:11:57,980 --> 01:11:59,189
Well…

1629
01:11:59,273 --> 01:12:01,608
-Just when we were talking yesterday.
-Right.

1630
01:12:03,652 --> 01:12:05,362
I thought about that.

1631
01:12:06,572 --> 01:12:07,531
You…

1632
01:12:08,991 --> 01:12:10,576
[Jeong-mok inhales sharply]

1633
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:14,788
-You…
-Mm-hmm.

1634
01:12:14,872 --> 01:12:15,914
You…

1635
01:12:16,582 --> 01:12:17,583
[Jeong-mok] Well…

1636
01:12:18,375 --> 01:12:19,918
[smacks lips, inhales]

1637
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:22,046
You could be the one.

1638
01:12:22,129 --> 01:12:25,424
-[enchanting music playing]
-Right. But you're not certain?

1639
01:12:26,091 --> 01:12:28,052
Well, actually, I'm sure.

1640
01:12:28,135 --> 01:12:30,137
I probably sound crazy. Do I?

1641
01:12:30,220 --> 01:12:31,180
No, tell me.

1642
01:12:31,722 --> 01:12:32,556
I don't? Really?

1643
01:12:32,639 --> 01:12:33,724
-Tell me.
-What did you say?

1644
01:12:34,433 --> 01:12:36,310
I mean, I've never dated anyone.

1645
01:12:37,811 --> 01:12:41,398
It's… the first time
I've ever felt this way.

1646
01:12:42,441 --> 01:12:45,903
Just… that kind of feeling. I mean…

1647
01:12:45,986 --> 01:12:46,862
[music fades]

1648
01:12:48,405 --> 01:12:49,323
Hmm…

1649
01:12:51,450 --> 01:12:52,409
I just thought,

1650
01:12:52,993 --> 01:12:54,828
-"I think I'm gonna marry her."
-Really?

1651
01:12:54,912 --> 01:12:56,914
[sweeping enchanting music playing]
