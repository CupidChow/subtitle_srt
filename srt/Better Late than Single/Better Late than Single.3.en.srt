What's your ideal type?

5
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:21,563
My type? Well…
maybe I always say the same thing,

6
00:00:21,646 --> 00:00:26,359
but I guess I like kind guys
that are offbeat and charming.

00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:31,948
It's really hard
to describe my ideal type.

9
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:35,910
I need more dating experience
to say anything about it.

10
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:38,872
But you do have some experience, right?

11
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:40,665
Well, I didn't think I did. I thought…

12
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:42,125

-A hundred days.

for my first impression pick.

00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:19,699
I chose you, so I thought about it
even before going to vote.

-It's here?
-Yeah.

It would've gone better
if I'd been friendlier.

Looking back on it now,
I think that was a mistake.

87
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,222
I should come off nicer.

-This is the seat.

-We just went on a date earlier today.
-I know, right?

95
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:01,115

-You can be honest.
-Well, I…

-Uh…
-I am glad we're getting to talk more.

100
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,292
Because earlier, we got closer…

101
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:14,212
I mean, we…
we talked a lot, but I thought,

102
00:04:14,295 --> 00:04:16,256
-"Did we get to know each other?"
-Yeah.

103
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:18,841
-So I wanted to talk more.
-Hmm.

104
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,388

Well, on another note,

108
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,357
I expected a new person to come.

109
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,234
But when he arrived…

110
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:37,819
-Hmm.
-Whoa, right?

111
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:40,488
Well, it might be a bit rude to say this,

112
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:44,325
but he's not really my type,
so I don't really care.

113
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:45,952
Still…

114
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,705
Well, when I first saw everyone,
I thought…

115
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:52,542
"They're all attractive,
but do they all have good jobs?"

116
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,502
But now, hearing what everyone does…

117
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:57,046
I mean, he's older, but he's a doctor.

118
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,007
And there's a med school student too.

119
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,174
I was surprised.

120
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:03,428
It's interesting, but I was surprised,

121
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:04,762
-to be honest.
-Hmm.

122
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:07,598
If I'm not interested in someone,
I really don't care.

123
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,434
I wasn't really paying attention.

124
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:14,230
I mean, why are we even
talking about them right now?

125
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:15,648
[chuckles] I don't get it.

[Ji-su] "Why is he talking about
other people, when it's just us two?"

128
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:25,283
I had that thought.

129
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:29,329

not that interesting to him?"

How old?

133
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:42,717
Younger than me, right?

134
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,968
Why do you say that?

135
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,554
Just your appearance and things.

136
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:49,766
I can't tell exactly,
but I'm guessing you're younger than me.

137
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,267
-You think so?
-Yeah.

138
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,518
You prefer older?

139
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,521
Actually, I…

140
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:58,024
Yeah, I do.

141
00:05:58,107 --> 00:05:59,192
-Really?
-But I honestly…

142
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:01,652
-[In-guk] What the hell?! Time-out!
-[Car] Come on, Sang-ho!

00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:02,779
-This is…
-Oh, seriously!

144
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,697
-[In-guk] Sang-ho!
-Sorry, but Sang-ho's just…

145
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:06,741
-You didn't teach him a thing?
-He doesn't care.

146
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:08,534
He said, "I think you're younger than me,"

147
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,828
and then he goes,
"Oh, I like older women."

148
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,330
Why is he doing this?

149
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:13,748
[Car] I can't believe this guy.

150
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:15,374

[Han-na] What? Is he just overly honest?

153
00:06:19,587 --> 00:06:21,047
Here's what I think it is.

154
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:24,967
At this point, Sang-ho is just realizing
that he has preferences too.

155
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:28,179
And instead of showing
an awkward level of affection for Ji-su…

156
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:30,556
-It's a must-miss.
-…he needs to just make things clear

157
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,266
and say what he wants to say.

-[Eun-ji] It does.

162
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:40,942
-You prefer older?
-I honestly don't know.

163
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:43,152
-Well, I've never dated before.
-Right.

164
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:48,407
But I think… a slight age difference
is better than being the same age.

165
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:50,451
-You want slightly older or younger.
-Or younger.

-Then it could be anyone.

167

171
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:02,004
Surprise.

172
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,965
YOUR 15 MINUTES IS UP
PLEASE PICK A NEW SPOT

173
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:05,424
Oh, it's over.

174
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:07,510
-What, really?
-Again, I--

175
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,887
-I have another question. Can I ask it?
-One more? Okay.

176
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:12,265
Would you go on another date with me?

177
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:14,350
[mellow music playing]

178
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:16,561
Of course, I would.

179
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:19,272
If you were to give me a score,
what would it be?

180
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:20,731
Mm.

181
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:23,776
[Ji-su] Mm.

182
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:26,571
[chuckles] Just…

183
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:32,285
-No, don't tell me that. Just go.
-Well, you're my top choice, obviously.

184
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:35,246
Really? Mm.

185
00:07:35,746 --> 00:07:36,581
Forget it.

186
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:40,042
-That feels like a forced answer. Just go.
-Oh, no, no. Why?

187
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,837
-That wasn't a forced answer.
-Okay, fine. Go.

188
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,754
[both chuckle]

189
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:46,090
-See you later.
-Just go.

190
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,177
[Sang-ho inhales sharply]

191
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,888
-I'll see you later, and… Okay.
-Okay.

192
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,222
[insects trilling]

193
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,144
[wistful music playing]

194
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:02,273
[Ji-su] You can tell
when someone has fond feelings for you

195
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:04,192
from the way they talk to you.

196
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:05,234
You can feel that.

197
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:08,571
They smile a lot,
or they listen to you carefully.

198
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:12,950
But Sang-ho doesn't seem to be
showing any of those signs right now.

199
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:17,246
Is he just not ready
to accept my feelings for him?

200
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:20,917
Am I pressuring him too much?

201
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,959
[sniffles]

202
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:24,504
If so, that'd be disappointing.

203
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:27,507
[music fades]

204
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,967
[clicks tongue] After this date,
I'm thinking,

205
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,302
"If I try a bit harder,

206
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:33,888
I have a good chance
of starting a relationship with her."

207
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:35,348
That's where I'm at now.

208
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:39,602
-[Han-na] What? What?
-And I mean, strategically speaking…

209
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,771
I don't know how things will go,

210
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,273
but I think
one more person might be joining us.

211
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,358
Wait, what?

212
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:47,276
-[laughs hysterically]
-No.

213
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,029
-What's wrong with this guy?
-[Eun-ji] This is a strategy then?

214
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:52,865
-[amusing music playing]
-Was this Sang-ho's strategy?

215
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,951
-Is he leaving his options open?
-Right.

216
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,994
This guy is unbelievable.

217
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,788
Was this the advice you gave him?

218
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,873
No, I don't know who this guy is.

219
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:01,874
[Cupids laughing]

220
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,961
-[Han-na] He's not your mentee anymore.
-No, no, no.

221
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,046
[Eun-ji] Seriously,
what advice did you give him?

222
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:10,299
[staff] So, you'll make up your mind
after another person joins?

223
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,425
Yeah, I think so.

224
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:15,555
WHAT KIND OF PERSON DO YOU HOPE WILL JOIN?

225
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:18,057
I hope the new person
will also like my looks,

226
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,892
and how I talk and stuff.

227
00:09:20,434 --> 00:09:22,478
I hope that person will be into me.

228
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:24,105
[mutters]

229
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,357
[chuckling] Sang-ho.

230
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,775
[Car exclaims]

231
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:30,987
I'm nervous.

232
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:35,283
-[man 1] Hey.
-[man 2] Min-hong.

233
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:37,451
-Both of you? Both of you?
-[Han-na] What? Two?

234
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,453
-[Jeong-mok] Yeah. Two.
-[Min-hong] Seriously?

235
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:40,997
-Yup.
-We're both here.

236
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,498
-[Min-hong] You both came?
-Yup.

237
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,499
[Jae-yun] Are you mad?

238
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,668
-[In-guk] How'd that happen?
-There are fewer women.

239
00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:48,170
-Five girls and six guys.
-[Eun-ji] That's why she got two.

240
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,589
POOL
MIN-HONG & JEONG-MOK, JAE-YUN

241
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,299
-I mean--
-There are more men than women.

242
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:52,550
So one woman gets two men.

243
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:53,676
[pleasant music playing]

244
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,053
-[Jeong-mok] Are you upset?
-No, I'm so glad.

245
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:57,972
So glad. [exhales]

246
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,058
[Min-hong] Wow, how fascinating.

247
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:04,937
The two guys that I had picked came to me.

248
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,897
I had hoped Jeong-mok would come.

249
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:08,357
CURRENT TOP PICK, JEONG-MOK

250
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:12,695
And I was glad that my
first impression pick, Jae-yun, came too.

251
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:13,988
FIRST IMPRESSION PICK, JAE-YUN

252
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:15,156
Like…

253
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:18,451
"Is God giving me a chance right now?"

254
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:19,577
[music fades]

255
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,330
So… we've spent two days here.

256
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,790
Anyone you're interested in?

257
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,960
-There is.
-[Jae-yun] It's, uh…

258
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,130
[Jeong-mok] And you…

259
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:33,507
-Same person, or someone new?
-Of course, there's someone.

260
00:10:34,258 --> 00:10:35,259
One person or several?

261
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:37,928
-Only one.
-[Jeong-mok] One?

262
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:41,098
[pensive music playing]

263
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,065
[music fades]

264
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:52,151
And do you… do you think
the person you're interested in

265
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,071
likes you back?

266
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,448
Are you getting that?

267
00:10:58,407 --> 00:10:59,575
I'm not sure.

268
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:03,621
I think he might be interested,
but maybe he's not.

269
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:05,706
I'm not sure.

270
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,960
Can't you just tell at some point?
Can't you…

271
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:14,256
Actually, you're the only person
I've really talked to in-depth

272
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,883
-since coming here.
-[Jeong-mok] Right.

273
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:17,968
[mellow music playing]

274
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:18,886
Me?

275
00:11:18,969 --> 00:11:20,304
Well, I just talked to you

276
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:22,014
-more than the others.
-[Jeong-mok] Okay.

277
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:24,975
We cooked together and stuff too.

278
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,644
[Eun-ji] Isn't she giving him a signal?

279
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:29,230
[Han-na] Yeah,
she's letting him know her feelings.

280
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:39,031
Jeong-mok and I
looked each other in the eyes

281
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:42,910
and really saw each other
for the first time. And…

282
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:46,539
If Jae-yun hadn't been there,

283
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:49,125
I actually might've hinted more,

284
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,127
and made it more obvious.

285
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:54,088
Like, "Yeah, you're the one I like."

286
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:58,801
[music fades]

287
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:02,888
Wow, Jae-yun has as much personality
as that beer on the table!

288
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,098
Wait, he's…

289
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:07,643
-He's getting even less attention.
-[In-guk] He's sitting there like a prop.

290
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:09,854
-[Eun-ji] An object.
-[Han-na] What do we do?

291
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:11,605
Oh, I'm curious about something.

292
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:14,442
What first impression did I make?

293
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:16,485
-Did you make?
-[Min-hong] Yeah.

294
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:19,113
-Your first impression…
-[Min-hong] Okay.

295
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:21,490
-You seemed really bossy.
-[Jeong-mok gasps]

296
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:22,992
[gasps]

297
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:25,786
-You just looked like--
-I didn't say anything.

298
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,580
[all laughing]

299
00:12:27,663 --> 00:12:29,290
Oh, boy. [sighs]

300
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:30,332
Wait, wait.

301
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,668
-Yes, yes, yes. Go on.
-[Jeong-mok] Keep going. Go on.

302
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:34,211
-I'm just kidding.
-Yeah, yeah sure.

303
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:36,672
-I'm joking. I'm just messing with you.
-[Jeong-mok] Sure.

304
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:37,840
You just… You seemed…

305
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:40,301
-I seemed bossy? Right.
-[Jae-yun] No, I mean…

306
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:41,635
[Min-hong] Hmm.

307
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:42,845
A little…

308
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:44,263
Just change topics.

309
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:45,931
You are not… not bossy.

310
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,057
Right.

311
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:48,350
[Min-hong] Uh-huh.

312
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:51,353
-Sure, you could think that.
-Oh, so, I just thought…

313
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,355
I seem a little bossy.

314
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:56,108
-I know I don't seem "not bossy."
-He means you know what you want.

315
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,652
-[Jae-yun] It's not that.
-Nice way to put it.

316
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,279
You just seemed more…

317
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:02,448
Yeah.

318
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:06,869
Never mind.

319
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:09,371
[Eun-ji] God! I'm dying!

320
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,499
-[Han-na] It's frustrating.
-[In-guk] Jesus Christ.

321
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:12,541
Oh, shit.

322
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,878
Do you know what
Koreans can't stand the most?

323
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,713
[slow amusing music playing]

324
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:19,840
-Saying nothing--
-[Eun-ji] Not saying anything.

325
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,884
-Stopping mid-sentence.
-After bringing it up.

326
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:22,968
Seriously.

327
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,887
I guess my first impression

328
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,680
-wasn't that great.
-No, it wasn't that.

329
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:27,598
You seemed…

330
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:30,142
She seemed kind of extroverted?

331
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:33,103
Oh, right, extroverted.
I… I thought you were extroverted.

332
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,063
Hmm.

333
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,606
Oh, God. [sighs]

334
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:38,817
I… I think I started off
on the wrong foot.

335
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:42,071
Okay.

336
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:45,407
Then, what was your
first impression of me, Jeong-mok?

337
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:48,452
[inhales sharply] Well, actually…

338
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,372
First impression.

339
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,167
-I thought you were…

Wow. [gasps]

-Really, you're right.
-Thank you. When you first walked in

347
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:10,683
I just thought you were some rich boy.

348
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:13,018
Wait, but what rich boy dresses like that?

349
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,563

I was petite and cute.

I think I feel more comfortable
around Min-hong.

360
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:44,592
I think she might be older than me,

361

to talk to her on the third day."

00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,065
I'm here. At the pyramid.

518
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:16,525
[Ji-su] Hello.

519
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,403
PYRAMID TENT
JI-SU & HYUN-KYU

520
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:21,071
This feels like we're on a picnic.

521
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:24,241
[Hyun-kyu] I've been
wanting to talk to Ji-su.

522
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:26,326
[mellow electronic music playing]

523
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:29,746
-Ji-su, was your last name Kang?
-Kang Ji-su, yes.

524
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:32,958
Hyun-kyu has been interested
in Ji-su the whole time.

525
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,710
[Eun-ji] Right. He has been interested.

526
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:39,131
[Hyun-kyu] I voted for Ji-su
because I was really curious about her.

527
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:43,135
But I haven't had a chance to talk to her.

528
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:46,054
She was with Sang-ho almost all day.

529
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,640
So I became
even more curious and I thought,

530
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:51,184
"I should try and talk to her in person."

531
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:53,103
And thankfully, I got my chance.

532
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:54,438
[music fades]

533
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:57,107
I think this is our first time talking.
How does it feel?

534
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:59,443
Yeah, I've really been
wanting to talk to you.

535
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:00,944
Right.

536
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:03,613
[charming music playing]

537
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:08,118
But we didn't have a chance
to talk earlier today.

538
00:22:08,201 --> 00:22:10,704
Honestly, I'm not really good
at looking people in the eye.

539
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:13,457
-I mean, I don't avoid them on purpose.
-Oh, why?

540
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,376
-It's cute if you're upfront about it.
-[Eun-ji] Yeah.

541
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,377
You can't?

542
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:18,962
When I feel too shy,

543
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:21,465
-I can't look people in the eye. And…
-Oh, you're too shy.

544
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:22,883
Just…

545
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,096
So, it's kinda like… [chuckles nervously]

546
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,306
Like, yeah…

547
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:32,601
I'm curious,
was I your first impression pick?

548
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:35,645
Why?

549
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:36,897
Well, I'm just curious.

550
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,482
-Just curious?
-Yeah.

551
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:39,399
You were.

552
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:41,193
-I thought so.
-Oh, really?

553
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,695
-Why?
-I just…

554
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:44,654
I just

555
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:46,740
got that sense.

556
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:47,699
[Hyun-kyu] Hmm.

557
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,452
-"I think this person voted for me."
-Really?

558
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:52,079
You just get that feeling, so…

559
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:53,747
[charming music continues]

560
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:58,168
I kept feeling Hyun-kyu's gaze on me.

561
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:01,797
I felt someone's eyes following me around,

562
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:05,842
and whenever I looked up,
Hyun-kyu was there.

563
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:06,760
[Cupids exclaim]

564
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:08,720
-[In-guk] That's important.
-[Car] Right.

565
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:11,139
-[Eun-ji] Your gaze doesn't lie.
-[Han-na] That's right.

566
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:15,560
[In-guk] It makes you
care about that person.

567
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:18,647
I'm looking over here, but I see you
looking at me from over there.

568
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,108
That could make you
think of them all day long.

569
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,192
Yeah, absolutely.

570
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:26,113
-[Ji-su] So, I caught on.
-[chuckles]

571
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:27,948
-Yeah.
-Oh, really?

572
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:31,284
-Yeah.
-I thought I wasn't being too obvious.

573
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:34,454
Oh, you might not have been obvious.

574
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:37,457
I just have this habit
of looking around at people.

575
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:38,959
Now I feel like…

576
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:41,670
[chuckling] Like you've been able to
see right through me.

577
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:42,754
No, no.

578
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:47,175
I thought, "Am I being a bit of a diva?"
I just accepted it. [chuckles]

579
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,844
There's a lot I wanna know.

580
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:51,304
-Then ask me. We don't have much time.
-I know.

581
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:53,181
How was it today? You two…

582
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:56,893
You and Sang-ho
were stuck together all day long.

583
00:23:57,477 --> 00:24:00,939
Right. Well, I voted for Sang-ho
during the first impression pick.

584
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:01,857
[Hyun-kyu] Hmm.

585
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:06,528
I actually have a definite type.
I like guys, uh,

586
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,238
who look like big teddy bears.

587
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:09,406
[Hyun-kyu] Hmm.

588
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,952
Personality-wise, I like people

589
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:16,454
who are decisive
and can express their emotions.

590
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:19,249
I mean, if you're like,
"I can't decide between two people,"

591
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:20,917
then that doesn't work for me.

592
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:21,918
[Hyun-kyu] Hmm.

593
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:25,881
But I want to ask you,
would you go for someone who

594
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:27,674
isn't your type?

595
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,594
To be honest…

596
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:35,056
you're the second guy who's my type.

597
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,725
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

598
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:40,187
So you don't even
have to ask me that question.

599
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:43,690
-[Eun-ji] Oh, Ji-su. What's this?
-[Han-na] What?

600
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:45,275
He has a chance.

601
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:47,277
She's like girls on Too Hot to Handle.

602
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,738
-[Car] I know.
-[Eun-ji] Right? She's so straightforward.

603
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:52,866
-Need to learn a thing or two from Ji-su.
-Ji-su, you're doing so well.

604
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:54,951
[enchanting music playing]

605
00:24:55,493 --> 00:24:58,538
[Hyun-kyu] Ji-su said
Sang-ho was closest to her ideal type.

606
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:02,125
A guy who's like a teddy bear
and is decisive.

607
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:04,211
She said that, and I was thinking,

608
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:06,796
"Do I even have a chance then?"

609
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,965
But she said I was the second-closest,

610
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:11,009
so I felt really relieved.

611
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:14,012
And it made me feel hopeful too,
of course.

612
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:18,892
For me, my ideal type
is almost the same as who I want to be.

613
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:21,228
Oh, what kind of person is that?

614
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:23,730
Well, I want to be cheerful.

615
00:25:24,814 --> 00:25:26,816
-You are cheerful.
-Am I?

616
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:28,818
I'm glad I seem that way.

617
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,779
You have such a cute smile.

618
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:32,239
[chuckling] Thank you.

619
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:34,908
Don't get me wrong.
I wasn't flirting just now.

620
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:36,201
[chuckling] That's okay.

621
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:38,703
I was flattered.

622
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:39,913
[chuckles]

623
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:41,456
[chuckling] What's this?

624
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:43,833
[Ji-su] But…

625
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:47,170
I think I get along better
with Hyun-kyu, actually.

626
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:50,298
That's why I told Hyun-kyu that.

627
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:53,510
It takes a simple "I like you"
to make me approach them

628
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:55,971
and show my charms to win them over.

629
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:59,516
And then he told me
that he was interested in me.

630
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:01,893
I like someone who says
he likes me the best.

631
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:04,020
That made me see him in a new light.

632
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:05,772
We didn't have enough time to talk,

633
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:09,192
so I hope I get a chance
to go on a date with her one-on-one.

634
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:10,944
WHO DO YOU LIKE MOST RIGHT NOW?

635
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:12,279
Ji-su is my top choice.

636
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:14,823
That's what I thought, so…

637
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:17,033
I think Hyun-kyu is a like a 93,

638
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:20,078
and Sang-ho is like a 95.
Something like that. [chuckles softly]

639
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:22,247
Jeez, Sang-ho is still a 95?

640
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:25,041
-What about him is a 95?
-It could change if it's this close.

641
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:27,335
If things go well,
Ji-su might change her mind.

642
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,546
They might have a conversation
that changes things.

643
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:31,089
-So, I…
-Right.

644
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:32,757
YOUR 15 MINUTES IS UP

645
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:34,843
[gasps] Eternal Singles' Night is over.

646
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,594
[Hyun-kyu] Wanna get going then?

647
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:38,888
-Help her up.
-Need a hand?

648
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:41,224
-[Ji-su] Oh, jeez. This isn't flirting.
-[Car] Of course.

649
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:43,852
Should I call it a gesture then?

650
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:47,272
If you want something more decisive,
we can call it flirting too.

651
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:49,649
-[light music playing]
-[both laughing]

652
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:50,859
[Ji-su] That was charming.

653
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:52,277
-[Hyun-kyu] Really?
-[Ji-su] Yeah.

654
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,361
[Hyun-kyu] Got it.

655
00:26:54,612 --> 00:26:55,447
[music fades]

656
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,240
[Ji-su] Didn't we say
we'd talk before bed?

657
00:26:57,324 --> 00:26:58,950
[Do] Let's have a girls' night.

658
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,035
[Yeo-myung] In Do's room?

659
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:04,205
Didn't things take a turn
during today's Eternal Singles' Night?

660
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:07,292
Yeah, and especially
when a new guy showed up.

661
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:08,209
[Ji-yeon] Yeah.

662
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:11,629
And like, he's pretty good-looking,
to be honest.

663
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:13,340
-Oh!
-Why?

664
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:16,343
-Like a sense of danger?
-[Ji-yeon] Is that why we were shaken up?

665
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:19,179
I don't even care. [laughs]

666
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:23,058
You think your
first impression pick would've changed

667
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:25,685
if he'd been here from the beginning?
You're like…

668
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:27,896
"No, not at all."
I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

669
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:28,813
[both laugh]

670
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:31,232
Who do you think I like? Try to guess.

671
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:32,776
-Can you not tell?
-Is there someone?

672
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:34,903
-I was being so obvious.
-[Ji-yeon] Oh, Jeong-mok?

673
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,030
-Jeong-mok?
-Yes, it's him.

674
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:40,033
[Ji-yeon] After talking to
Jae-yun one-on-one today,

675
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:42,911
I think I like Jeong-mok
about this much more.

676
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:46,206
But I also liked Jae-yun
just based on first impressions.

677
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:47,207
[Min-hong] Same as me.

678
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:49,167
But then, I totally just…

679
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,753
From that night on,
I've been into Jeong-mok.

680
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:53,755
[Min-hong] Oh.

681
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:56,007
[pensive music playing]

682
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:58,802
I hope I'll go on a date
with Jeong-mok tomorrow.

683
00:27:58,885 --> 00:27:59,761
[Ji-yeon] What?

684
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:02,180
Doesn't Sang-ho have slightly darker skin?

685
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:03,765
-[Ji-su] What?
-[Ji-yeon] He does.

686
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:06,476
[Do] Wait, then Jeong-mok is like
the most popular guy right now.

687
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:09,979
But I literally can't tell who he's into.
He just keeps smiling.

688
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:11,314
-Hasn't anyone heard?
-Why?

689
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:12,690
-Does no one know?
-Not at all.

690
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:14,067
Earlier, during my spot date,

691
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:18,738
I asked if there was someone he wanted to
go on a one-on-one date with.

692
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:21,825
And he said, "Well, I'm kind of confused,

693
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:23,868
I'm still thinking it over."

694
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,912
-That's just how he talks.
-Jeong-mok?

695
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:29,165
No, he said there was someone.
He must've just picked someone.

696
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:31,584
Anyone you want to go
on a one-on-one date with?

697
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:34,921
Hmm, one-on-one?
Sure. But I'm still thinking about it.

698
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:38,425
Is there someone
you want to go on a date with?

699
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:40,260
-One-on-one? Anyone?
-There is.

700
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:42,804
When was that?

701
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:44,973
-Was he your first spot date?
-[Ji-yeon] Me? Second.

702
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:46,766
-[Do] Oh. [gasps]
-[Min-hong gasps]

703
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:49,811
-[Ji-yeon] I think you're right.
-Hang on. But when Jeong-mok asked

704
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:52,272
whether I had someone in mind,

705
00:28:52,355 --> 00:28:53,440
I told him,

706
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:56,401
-"Yes, I'm sure about one person."
-Oh, your gaze.

707
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:57,819
And I went like this.

708
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,156
But we both like the same guy.

709
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:02,991
-[Ji-yeon] What?
-Is that okay?

710
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:06,035
With Jeong-mok, I don't know
if we're just friends or something more.

711
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:08,747
I only talked to him
for the first time today.

712
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,749
Jeong-mok is really popular now.

713
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:12,125
He's the leading man.

714
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:14,586
[Do] Right? He used to be the shyest.

715
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:17,547
Still, Jeong-mok has become…

716
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:20,258
-[Eun-ji] Yeah.
-…the most popular man on the second day.

717
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:22,969
-[Han-na] I know.
-I mean, he's charming. I get it.

718
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:24,971
I hope… Oh, I hope Jae-yun learns

719
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:27,307
-from watching Jeong-mok a bit more.
-Should share intel.

720
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:29,350
[Han-na] Mixing them together
would be perfect.

721
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,144
[Min-hong] Who do you think Jae-yun likes?

722
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:32,187
[Ji-yeon] I don't know.

723
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:34,022
For the second spot date,

724
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,732
he suddenly asked me,

725
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:39,652
"How would you feel if you liked
the same person as someone else?"

726
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:43,740
He suddenly just asked me that,
and I was like, "Why do you ask?"

727
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:47,494
And he said that he just had a feeling,
which made me think,

728
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:50,205
"Is it me?" You know? For no reason.

729
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:51,456
[whimsical music playing]

730
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:52,749
[Ji-yeon] That's true.

731
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,251
-[Do] Hmm.
-[Ji-su] Oh, hmm.

732
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:58,505
Do you worry about something like that?
Liking the same person, or…

733
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:01,549
Why? Are you already worried about that?

734
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,009
I'm not exactly worried,

735
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:05,678
but this one guy and I both noticed
that we like the same person.

736
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:06,888
Oh.

737
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:10,517
"Oh, you too? Well, me too."
It was kind of like that.

738
00:30:12,018 --> 00:30:15,230
[Min-hong] Jae-yun suddenly
started telling me about that.

739
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:17,398
He thought that the person he liked

740
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:20,276
might have something going
on with someone else.

741
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:24,531
But just before that,
we were talking in a group of three.

742
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:29,244
And then I thought maybe Jae-yun
had felt my interest in Jeong-mok,

743
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:32,330
which made him ask me
that kind of question.

744
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:35,959
I think the guys
who are interested in me now

745
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:38,670
are Jeong-mok and Jae-yun.

746
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:41,714
Then, I felt kind of bad.

747
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:44,175
"What is his intention
for asking me this?"

748
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:48,471
Anyway, that's how things went.

749
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:51,391
-Oh.
-[music ends]

750
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:52,767
[laughs]

751
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:55,144
-[Car] Back in the day…
-I'm embarrassed for her.

752
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:58,481
Back in high school,
I had a friend who was kind of like her.

753
00:30:58,565 --> 00:31:00,233
She kept asking me if I liked her.

754
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:02,527
-[Han-na] When you didn't?
-That led to a huge fight.

755
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:04,320
-Things got bad.
-Was it a huge fight?

756
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:05,405
Yes, it was a huge fight.

757
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:08,032
-Min-hong read into it too much.
-[Car] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

758
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:10,410
[Yeo-myung] Hello?

759
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:13,830
YEO-MYUNG IS ON THE PHONE WITH HER MOTHER

760
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:16,749
The new guy chose me
based on first impressions,

761
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:19,752
and then I had
a long conversation with him.

762
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:25,425
But the guy
I'm really interested in is Jeong-mok.

763
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:30,388
And there's this really pretty girl,
and she and I both like him.

764
00:31:31,097 --> 00:31:33,182
I'm getting really worried.

765
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:37,562
And like, we went roller skating
on our date today, like, as a group.

766
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:40,273
And I asked Jeong-mok
to take another lap with me,

767
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:44,235
but he said he was tired
and that I should go with someone else.

768
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:45,778
[somber music playing]

769
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:48,448
That made me
really lose my self-assurance.

770
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:51,367
So I was sad.

771
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:54,037
[sighs]

772
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:58,458
I must really, truly have no charm.

773
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,711
I'm losing confidence.

774
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:05,715
[music fades]

775
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:07,800
[upbeat music playing]

776
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:10,720
[Han-na] The third day has begun.

777
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:12,847
[cell phone chimes]

778
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:14,766
[Ji-yeon] Do, the newsletter's here.

779
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,603
-It's probably--
-What? The 5 Minute Library Quiz?

780
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:20,396
-A library quiz?
-"First come first serve."

781
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,606
-[Han-na] I like this.
-Look!

782
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:24,525
-We have to answer these questions, quick.
-I'm so curious. [exclaims]

783
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:26,110
[Sang-ho] Hey, hurry, hurry.

784
00:32:26,194 --> 00:32:28,988
[Ji-yeon] It said they'd open
the 5 Minute Library

785
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:32,075
to the first three
who solve the questions.

786
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:35,328
[Do] I'm dying to know,
it's driving me crazy.

787
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:37,205
[Seung-li] Weird, right?

788
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:39,290
[Seung-chan] It was
harder than I'd expected.

789
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:40,625
I think, if I go like this…

790
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:42,502
-Not working.
-…the answer would be there.

791
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:44,128
-But I don't know.
-[Do] It won't work.

792
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:45,421
[Jeong-mok sighs]

793
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:47,507
-I have a headache.
-[Hyun-kyu] Is it that hard?

794
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:50,259
-I don't know what else I got wrong.
-The rest can't be wrong.

795
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:52,762
-Oh, what? Hey, Yeo-myung.
-[Do] You're first?

796
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:53,846
Wow!

797
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:54,806
[Eun-ji exclaims]

798
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:56,891
[upbeat music playing]

799
00:32:58,601 --> 00:32:59,519
Diary?

800
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:04,107
I read Jeong-mok's book.

801
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:07,819
"INFJ"? "First relationship"?

802
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:09,779
I want to attract his interest first,

803
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:12,490
so I read stuff like
what his ideal type is,

804
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:16,202
his MBTI type, where he sits
when he's interested in someone.

805
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:17,161
Stuff like that.

806
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:19,247
[upbeat music continues]

807
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:24,502
[Jeong-mok] I read Do's diary.

808
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:31,384
For the question, "The man you like
goes on a date with another woman."

809
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:33,803
"What would you like him to tell you?"

810
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:38,307
She answered that she wanted the man
to tell her what they did,

811
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:41,269
but also that nothing much happened.

812
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,563
So I thought I should remember that.

813
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:46,065
Ah-ha.

814
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:48,151
Nice, nail on the head.

815
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:51,946
[music fades]

816
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:54,949
This… Who left this behind?

817
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:57,785
I should've read this first.

818
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,663
Which one? Oh, oh, that.

819
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:02,749
30 MINUTES EARLIER

820
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:05,293
-Oh, something else must've arrived.
-[Eun-ji] What is it?

821
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:06,961
[curious music playing]

822
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:09,172
-What is it? We get something?
-Something…

823
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,090
A LETTER ARRIVED FOR JEONG-MOK

824
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:13,384
-[Jae-yun] Huh?
-[Car] Is it just a personal letter?

825
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:16,846
[mellow whimsical music playing]

826
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:22,226
[Han-na] "I hope we go
on a one-on-one date tomorrow."

827
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,896
"We were by each other's sides
all day today."

828
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:27,065
But who was with Jeong-mok all day long?

829
00:34:27,815 --> 00:34:30,568
Who is it? I can't tell who it's from.

830
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:34,155
[Jeong-mok] Hmm.

831
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:37,241
[music fades]

832
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:41,412
A LETTER ALSO ARRIVED FOR SEUNG-LI

833
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:42,872
[Seung-li] I got a letter.

834
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:45,041
-I opened my mailbox…
-Oh, it's here.

835
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:47,293
-…and there was a protein bar…
-Yeah, I saw that.

836
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:48,586
…and a letter with it.

837
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:49,754
[cheerful music playing]

838
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:52,048
It was like, "I wish you the best."

839
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:54,300
"Try to guess who I am."

840
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:57,887
"The hint is in the envelope
and protein bar."

841
00:34:57,970 --> 00:35:00,556
So, I was guessing
it might've been from Do.

842
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:05,186
There was something written in the lounge
in the same handwriting.

843
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:07,897
It said that she roasted sweet potatoes

844
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:09,732
and washed the tomatoes.

845
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:11,192
And when I took a look,

846
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:14,403
the handwriting was
so similar to the letter in my mailbox.

847
00:35:14,987 --> 00:35:17,490
So, I think I'm about 90% sure.

848
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:19,909
[Han-na, Eun-ji and Car exclaim]

849
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:23,204
[Han-na] I think it's from Do.

850
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,419
Hey, this is such a sweet gesture.

851
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:32,880
This could really have a huge effect.

852
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,258
-Right.
-Yeah, if someone cares for you like that…

853
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:36,634
[music fades]

854
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:38,052
[cell phones chiming]

855
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,303
Let's go.

856
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:41,430
It's the matching
for the one-on-one dates.

857
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:43,307
Let's go on one-on-one dates. Let's do it.

858
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:45,560
[Ji-yeon] We're being matched
for our one-on-one dates.

859
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,728
-They must be lunch dates.
-[Do] For lunch?

860
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:50,982
Hey, but if it's one-on-one,
one guy won't have a date.

861
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:52,275
Oh, you're right.

862
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:53,818
[peppy music playing]

863
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:56,863
[Yeo-myung gasps] It's a claw machine.

864
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:58,948
-[Ji-yeon] A claw machine?
-[Yeo-myung] Yeah.

865
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:00,700
Oh, we must be picking them ourselves.

866
00:36:00,783 --> 00:36:04,078
[Ji-su] "Today, the single ladies
will play the claw machine

867
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:06,122
to choose their date partners."

868
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:08,040
-[gasps]
-[Han-na] It's fun, it's fun.

869
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:09,709
-The women must choose the men.
-Right.

870
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:13,546
-Oh, their names are on the stuffed toys.
-Their names are on them.

871
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:16,674
But this will show you
who you want to go on a date with.

872
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:17,842
Right, right.

873
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:20,845
-[Jeong-mok] We're one woman short.
-One person has to stay.

874
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:23,055
One person can't go?
That's so cruel. [laughs]

875
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,266
-[Jeong-mok] That's mean.
-[Sang-ho] One person stays.

876
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:27,310
Do we not have a chance
to choose? [chuckles]

877
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:29,645
There were more men than women.

878
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:31,397
Six men and five women,

879
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,149
so one man would be left.

880
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:35,818
I was imagining what it would look like.

881
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:40,239
Like he'd go and eat Chapagetti
by himself in a corner.

882
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:43,993
-[Seung-chan] Mine's close.
-[Hyun-kyu] Trying to make his case.

883
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:44,994
[Car exclaims]

884
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:47,371
This is an outright popularity contest.

885
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:49,498
-Who'll win Jeong-mok's stuffed toy?
-[Eun-ji gasps]

886
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:52,293
-He's the most popular guy.
-He's a hot ticket at the moment.

887
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:53,336
[Eun-ji] Right.

888
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:55,588
If someone wins his toy,
competition's over for him.

889
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:57,632
Jeong-mok is practically Dex
at this point.

890
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:58,799
[Car] That's right.

891
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:02,053
Watch closely.
If Ji-su doesn't choose Kim Sang-ho…

892
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:04,263
-Off to eat Chapagetti.
-You're right.

893
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:06,599
-No one besides Ji-su.
-No one is interested in that guy.

894
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:08,684
Should've done better
while he had her interest.

895
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:11,062
-He'd go straight to making Chapagetti.
-Other than Ji-su,

896
00:37:11,145 --> 00:37:12,813
no one has ever mentioned Sang-ho.

897
00:37:12,897 --> 00:37:15,191
He's a guy who'll grill up
some Spam with his Chapagetti.

898
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:16,150
No doubt.

899
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,194
I'm curious what you'll do
if you get left behind.

900
00:37:18,277 --> 00:37:20,780
-[Hyun-kyu] Sit here alone.
-It'd be sad sitting by yourself.

901
00:37:20,863 --> 00:37:22,823
We can't even choose the person we like.

902
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:25,201
-This is scarier than a random date.
-[Hyun-kyu] I know.

903
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:26,619
[jovial music playing]

904
00:37:26,702 --> 00:37:27,828
ORDER FOR CLAW MACHINE

905
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:30,581
YI DO, YEO-MYUNG, JI-SU, MIN-HONG, JI-YEON

906
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:33,584
-[Eun-ji] Do, let's go!
-[In-guk] All right, Do!

907
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:35,628
-[Do] Do I start right away?
-Yeah, just try it.

908
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:38,089
[suspenseful whimsical music playing]

909
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:39,799
-[gasps]
-[Ji-su sighs]

910
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:41,550
-[Yeo-myung] I'm nervous.
-[Do] Hang on.

911
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:48,516
Jeez, having the guys
watch you from the other side

912
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,059
must feel like so much pressure.

913
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:51,936
Excuse me, can you guys close your eyes?

914
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:53,437
[Ji-yeon] Don't pressure us.

915
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:54,647
[Do] Hey, come on!

916
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:56,190
All right. We won't watch.

917
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,401
-[Do] Pressure.
-We won't. We're not even curious.

918
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:01,696
[Jeong-mok] I hoped
that Do would choose me.

919
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,239
[Do grunts]

920
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:04,824
[Hyun-kyu] So, the person they want…

921
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:06,492
[Do gasps, grunts]

922
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:10,037
-[Do] No, no, no. Oh, what is that?
-Where is it going? Where? Where?

923
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:15,084
[Hyun-kyu] We signed up for this?

924
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:16,711
-[Do] I don't think…
-It's coming up!

925
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:18,546
-[Eun-ji and Han-na exclaim]
-[Do] Oh, oh.

926
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,047
It was Seung-li.

927
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:21,549
I don't think she got one.

928
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,426
[whimsical music playing]

929
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:26,304
Hang on. Don't look! You can totally tell!

930
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:28,889
-[Yeo-myung] This is really hard.
-[Do] Wait, wait.

931
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:30,391
[Jeong-mok] It didn't feel good.

932
00:38:30,975 --> 00:38:32,852
She was interested in Seung-li.

933
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:35,021
-[Eun-ji] Oh, he saw it!
-[In-guk] They saw it.

934
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:38,733
Jeez, Do couldn't win the stuffed toy,
and she let him know she likes him.

935
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:39,650
NEXT IS YEO-MYUNG

936
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:42,320
-[Do] Hurry, try another one.
-Show them what you've got.

937
00:38:42,403 --> 00:38:43,362
[lively music playing]

938
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:45,906
-[Yeo-myung] Don't watch.
-[Seung-chan and Jeong-mok] Okay.

939
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:50,077
[Jae-yun] I hoped that
Yeo-myung would choose me.

940
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:53,247
[Yeo-myung] Since this morning,

941
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:56,334
I kept thinking about wanting to
go on a date with Jeong-mok.

942
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:59,086
So, I tried to win
Jeong-mok's stuffed toy.

943
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:03,716
JEONG-MOK

944
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:05,468
[Eun-ji] Oh, nice, nice, nice!

945
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:07,553
-I think she'll win.
-[In-guk] I think she got it.

946
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,014
Oh, it was… It was too close to the beak.

947
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:12,058
[Do] I don't think
any of us got the quiz right,

948
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:14,727
and none of us
will win the stuffed toys either.

949
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:18,647
At first, Yeo-myung
went for Jeong-mok's stuffed toy,

950
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:20,316
but then she failed to win it.

951
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:23,235
So I was thinking,
"Well, that's a relief."

952
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:25,571
Yeah, Min-hong is happy.

953
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:27,073
THIRD IS JI-SU

954
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:28,616
[Yeo-myung] I know, right?

955
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:30,409
[breezy music playing]

956
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:34,080
Will you please
look at the clouds for a minute?

957
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:35,414
[Hyun-kyu] Okay.

958
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:39,460
[Seung-li] For the claw machine,

959
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:42,963
I hoped that Ji-su would pick me.

960
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:45,216
I wanted to go on a date with Ji-su,

961
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:47,802
because I was the most curious about her.

962
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:49,720
I had a lot of questions to ask her.

963
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:54,392
[Sang-ho] Since Ji-su said she chose me
for the first impression pick,

964
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:55,726
I think I'll be with Ji-su.

965
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:58,521
-Oh, Sang-ho already thinks that…
-He seems so sure of himself.

966
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:01,774
-He's full of confidence. Very certain.
-[Han-na] He's a strategist, this guy.

967
00:40:01,857 --> 00:40:05,152
Actually, Hyun-kyu was also pretty close

968
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:08,406
to the ideal type I mentioned
on the first day, you know?

969
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,616
I was going back and forth.

970
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:14,203
I can't think of any other way
to describe it, but really…

971
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:16,247
So when I was playing the claw machine,

972
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:19,750
I couldn't make up my mind
until the moment I grabbed the joystick.

973
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:22,503
Oh, so she contemplated it until the end.

974
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,588
Everyone, look away.

975
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:30,553
-Oh, she got it!
-[Car] She got it.

976
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:32,096
-Yes, yes, she got it!
-Who is it?

977
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:33,264
-Really?
-[Eun-ji] Who?

978
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:34,807
-She got one.
-Oh?

979
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:36,976
-[Ji-su] What? Huh?
-[Do] What?!

980
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:40,146
-[Min-hong] Congratulations.
-[In-guk] Who is it?

981
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:41,355
-[Eun-ji] Who?
-Who is it?

982
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:43,149
[clanks]

983
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:44,817
[Do] Who is it?

984
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:47,153
Who is it?

985
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:50,906
-I saw it.
-You did?

986
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,867
-[Ji-yeon] I saw it too.
-Who is it? Who is it?

987
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:56,036
-[Han-na gasps]
-[In-guk] Hyun-kyu!

988
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,872
-[Eun-ji screams]
-[Car laughing]

989
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:59,748
-93 points!
-Hey, Ji-su!

990
00:40:59,832 --> 00:41:00,875
Great job!

991
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:01,792
Kim Sang-ho.

992
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:03,961
-Start boiling the Chapagetti water.
-[Han-na laughs]

993
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:06,839
-Let me run through Sang-ho's day for you.
-"Start boiling the water."

994
00:41:06,922 --> 00:41:09,049
-This is the situation Sang-ho is in.
-[Han-na] Right.

995
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:12,094
Sang-ho quit his job,
banking on his unemployment benefits.

996
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:13,304
So, he just thought,

997
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:16,640
"I'll get unemployment benefits,
I don't have to work,"

998
00:41:16,724 --> 00:41:19,059
-but then, he didn't get them.
-He didn't get them.

999
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:20,311
[laughs]

1000
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:23,189
-"Start boiling the water." Hilarious.
-Get that water ready.

1001
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:27,193
My tentative prediction
is that Ji-su will lean towards Hyun-kyu.

1002
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:28,736
[upbeat music playing]

1003
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:29,778
[Yeo-myung and Do gasp]

1004
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:31,947
-[Do] Really?
-[Min-hong] Congratulations.

1005
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:36,535
[Eun-ji] Jeez,
everything's so unpredictable.

1006
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:43,334
Actually, my mind was set
on Hyun-kyu after the spot date.

1007
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:47,338
I wanted to talk to him a little more,
but the spot date was too short.

1008
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:49,965
I haven't been on a date with him,
so I thought,

1009
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:52,259
"Let's pick Hyun-kyu for now."

1010
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,178
[Hyun-kyu] Oh, I felt really good.

1011
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:57,097
It was short,
but I really tried hard to say something

1012
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,475
and express how I felt yesterday,

1013
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:01,602
and she must've felt that.

1014
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:03,979
I think that's why I felt even happier.

1015
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:07,358
[Seung-li] She chose
the med school student, Hyun-kyu.

1016
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:08,567
I wasn't really happy,

1017
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:11,028
because he's my competitor.

1018
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:13,739
[Sang-ho] Of course, I didn't feel great,
and I had thoughts like,

1019
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:16,033
"I should try harder
to impress her," and all that.

1020
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:18,285
-You should up your game.
-[Eun-ji] He felt that too.

1021
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,745
He needs to wake up.

1022
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:22,790
FOURTH IS MIN-HONG

1023
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:25,042
[Han-na] Will Min-hong
be able to pick Jeong-mok?

1024
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:27,169
[enthralling music playing]

1025
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:30,756
[imperceptible]

1026
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:35,261
[Ji-su] Don't go for the head.
Go for the body.

1027
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:37,137
Wait…

1028
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:39,265
-[Min-hong] This is--
-Who are you aiming for?

1029
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:42,476
She's giving advice now that
she won her stuffed toy. [laughs]

1030
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,728
-Please.
-[Do] Oh, you put it in like that.

1031
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:46,730
[contestants and Cupids exclaiming]

1032
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:47,815
[exclaims]

1033
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,653
Please, please.

1034
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:55,281
[Do squeals]

1035
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:56,740
-She got it.
-[Ji-yeon] You did it.

1036
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:58,826
[upbeat groovy music playing]

1037
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:03,247
[Min-hong] I got the stuffed toy
with the name Jeong-mok,

1038
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:05,165
who I've wanted to get to know more.

1039
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:06,500
I was very excited.

1040
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,919
Yesterday, I went on the group date,

1041
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:10,796
and Jeong-mok was there too,

1042
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,591
but we were with other people.

1043
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:16,719
So I didn't have a chance
to talk to him much.

1044
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:19,972
I'll finally get to
talk to him one-on-one,

1045
00:43:20,055 --> 00:43:21,599
without other people.

1046
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:23,809
I was really looking forward to it.

1047
00:43:23,892 --> 00:43:25,603
I don't think I was strategic enough.

1048
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:28,063
I probably should've focused more.

1049
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:29,773
I really regret it.

1050
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:33,777
-[Do] Did she get it?
-[Ji-yeon] Oh, I haven't gone yet.

1051
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:35,404
-[music fades]
-[indistinct chatter]

1052
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:37,448
FIFTH IS JI-YEON

1053
00:43:37,531 --> 00:43:39,158
Please don't watch. [chuckles]

1054
00:43:39,241 --> 00:43:40,743
We will watch, though.

1055
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:41,869
[Car] Oh, Ji-yeon.

1056
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:44,872
-[Han-na] Jae-yun will find out for sure.
-[Car] That's right.

1057
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:47,666
Might be better for Ji-yeon to
find out about him through this date.

1058
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:49,251
-[Han-na] True.
-[Car] That's right.

1059
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:51,503
-[breezy music playing]
-[Seung-chan chuckles]

1060
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:55,716
[Ji-yeon] I don't think it'll work.

1061
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:56,717
[Seung-chan exclaims]

1062
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,802
-[Eun-ji squealing]
-[Han-na exclaims]

1063
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:00,387
[Jeong-mok exclaims]

1064
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,222
-Ji-yeon!
-Oh, that was good.

1065
00:44:02,306 --> 00:44:03,724
-Is that mine?
-I dunno.

1066
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:05,976
[Han-na] I think Jae-yun saw it.

1067
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,562
[Ji-yeon] I chose Jae-yun's stuffed toy.

1068
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:12,566
My eyes met his
right before I picked his stuffed toy.

1069
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,735
I was so nervous. I was like,

1070
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:17,780
"What do I do? Seriously, what do I do?"

1071
00:44:17,863 --> 00:44:19,823
I was very… relieved.

1072
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:21,659
I sat next to her a few times,

1073
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:23,744
like when we went skating.

1074
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:26,955
So… I thought the mood
wouldn't be too awkward.

1075
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:28,582
But all that happened

1076
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,459
-because Ji-yeon made it happen.
-Yes, right.

1077
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:31,377
Through her effort.

1078
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:32,670
She approached him.

1079
00:44:33,253 --> 00:44:35,172
Wow, I guess it worked out nicely.

1080
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:36,799
I finally feel at ease now.

1081
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:38,300
[breezy music playing]

1082
00:44:38,384 --> 00:44:40,969
At this rate,
I might do this a hundred times.

1083
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:49,061
Oh? I think I got it.

1084
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:51,271
-Do whatever you want.
-[Yeo-myung] It's working well.

1085
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:53,315
[Do] Yeah, it's suddenly working well.

1086
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:55,234
Congrats, Seung-li.

1087
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:58,153
What a relief.

1088
00:44:58,237 --> 00:45:00,114
[Car] Jeong-mok could be
kind of disappointed.

1089
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:02,950
I won the stuffed toy after my second try.

1090
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:05,869
"I'll finally get to
talk to Seung-li for a long time."

1091
00:45:05,953 --> 00:45:08,997
That's all I could think about,
nothing else was on my mind.

1092
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:13,544
I was disappointed.
But I think I'll get another chance,

1093
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:16,171
-so I just told myself just to wait.
-[Car] I like his attitude.

1094
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:17,714
[gentle music playing]

1095
00:45:17,798 --> 00:45:22,219
I felt really upset because
I wanted to go on a date with Jeong-mok.

1096
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:24,138
But once it was my turn again,

1097
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:27,266
Seung-chan and Sang-ho
were the only ones left.

1098
00:45:34,314 --> 00:45:35,232
Will it work?

1099
00:45:37,734 --> 00:45:40,237
-[Hyun-kyu] I see part of the name.
-[Sang-ho] Who is it?

1100
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:43,365
-[Min-hong] Chan?
-[Car] That's right.

1101
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:44,908
Okay, right.

1102
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:46,952
-Oh, it's me.
-[Ji-yeon] Did you get it?

1103
00:45:47,035 --> 00:45:48,120
[Seung-chan chuckles]

1104
00:45:48,203 --> 00:45:50,914
Honestly, I didn't want to be
left by myself,

1105
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:53,333
so all I could think was, "What a relief."

1106
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:55,586
[Jae-yun] She chose Seung-chan.

1107
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:58,755
The first thing that came to mind was…

1108
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:01,592
"A doctor is hard to beat."

1109
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:04,887
Then the remaining one is really…

1110
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:06,013
That's tough.

1111
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:09,433
Well, it's him. Kim Sang-ho, 27,

1112
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:12,102
-researcher in the defense industry.
-[Han-na] "Start the water."

1113
00:46:12,186 --> 00:46:14,188
[laughing] "Researcher in…"

1114
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:17,316
"Kim Sang-ho, 27,
researcher in the defense industry."

1115
00:46:17,399 --> 00:46:18,484
Yeah, but I think Sang-ho

1116
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:20,611
-still has a chance with Ji-su.
-Yes, he does.

1117
00:46:20,694 --> 00:46:23,197
-But he has to do the right things.
-He has to change for real.

1118
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,948
-He has to change.
-If not, it'll be hard.

1119
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:25,866
[Car] Yes.

1120
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:27,784
[Do] Hey, let's go. come on

1121
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:29,203
Get dressed up.

1122
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:30,245
[Do] Oh, my.

1123
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:31,580
[Yeo-myung] Get dressed up.

1124
00:46:31,663 --> 00:46:32,915
-[Do] Oh, my.
-[Han-na] Oh, my!

1125
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:34,791
[pleasant music playing]

1126
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:36,210
Oh… Oh, my God.

1127
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:37,836
-Oh.
-[Sang-ho] Oh.

1128
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:41,048
[Ji-yeon, Do and Min-hong laughing]

1129
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:42,508
[Yeo-myung] Oh, I'm so shy.

1130
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:44,718
-So shy, so shy.
-Oh, that's so cute.

1131
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:47,804
-[Do] Ugh, I hate that.
-[In-guk] So cute.

1132
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:50,849
-[Yeo-myung] I'm embarrassed.
-I'm already dressed up though. [chuckles]

1133
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:53,477
-Are you already dressed?
-[Sang-ho] That's what you're wearing?

1134
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:54,645
[Car]
"I'm already dressed."

1135
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:56,939
-But what he's wearing…
-[Car] He's already dressed…

1136
00:46:57,022 --> 00:46:59,399
-Hurry up and get changed.
-…but he has to "get dressed up?"

1137
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:01,235
Shouldn't he force himself to get changed?

1138
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:03,028
-[Car] He should.
-Should wear a bow tie.

1139
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:04,321
-"A bow tie."
-[Eun-ji laughs]

1140
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:05,822
[Han-na] Should he wear suspenders?

1141
00:47:05,906 --> 00:47:08,700
Our single ladies
are much more straightforward and honest

1142
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:10,369
-than men are, you know?
-Right.

1143
00:47:10,452 --> 00:47:13,247
So, since the ladies
chose the men this time,

1144
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:15,290
things might feel a little different.

1145
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:17,292
They'll do a little better than they did

1146
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:18,877
-on their dates yesterday?
-I hope so.

1147
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:20,254
-[Han-na] Please.
-Please.

1148
00:47:20,337 --> 00:47:23,507
-Hyun-kyu and Ji-su will have a nice date.
-[Eun-ji] It'll be a good vibe.

1149
00:47:23,590 --> 00:47:25,676
ONE-ON-ONE DATE
JI-SU & HYUN-KYU

1150
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:28,136
-[Hyun-kyu] It's so picturesque.
-[Ji-su] I know.

1151
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:30,180
SEASIDE CAFE

1152
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:31,348
Might be too hot.

1153
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:33,976
[pleasant music playing]

1154
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:35,394
What is this?

1155
00:47:35,477 --> 00:47:37,980
-How about you put a cushion on her lap?
-The sun is so strong.

1156
00:47:38,063 --> 00:47:39,648
-Oh, Ji-su is doing it herself.
-Right.

1157
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:41,942
[In-guk] Oh, he was late.

1158
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:44,444
-He caught on though.
-[Eun-ji] He's taking off his cardigan.

1159
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:46,530
[quirky music playing]

1160
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:49,616
[laughs] He keeps flapping the cardigan.

1161
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:52,119
That's why he keeps
fanning himself like he's Jo Sung-mo.

1162
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:54,121
[both scatting "Pledge" by Jo Sung-mo]

1163
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:55,789
-[laughing]
-[Han-na laughs]

1164
00:47:55,872 --> 00:47:57,207
[quirky music continues]

1165
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:59,501
-It's hotter here than I thought.
-[slide whistle plays]

1166
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:00,711
Oh, no, no! Keep it on!

1167
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:03,255
-But it's better than being cold.
-Your top is sleeveless! No!

1168
00:48:03,338 --> 00:48:04,715
[Han-na] No, no, no!

1169
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:06,800
[Ji-su] Yeah, I guess. Oh.

1170
00:48:06,883 --> 00:48:07,718
[Hyun-kyu] Hmm.

1171
00:48:12,472 --> 00:48:13,473
[music fades]

1172
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:17,269
[Hyun-kyu] Ma'am,
do you maybe have a blanket?

1173
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:18,270
Just to cover her lap.

1174
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:21,315
-Like a piece of cloth. Something light.
-[woman] Right. Just a second.

1175
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:23,275
Yes, get a blanket from somewhere instead.

1176
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:25,027
-Good.
-[Ji-su] Put the tray here?

1177
00:48:25,652 --> 00:48:28,155
-[woman] Here's a blanket for you. Yes.
-[Ji-su] Oh, thank you.

1178
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:29,489
The blanket might be too hot,

1179
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:32,242
but I thought this would be better
than the cushion. [chuckles]

1180
00:48:32,951 --> 00:48:34,953
No, I was seriously contemplating this.

1181
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:37,914
-You were?
-"Should I take his cardigan or not?"

1182
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:40,751
Oh, I was going to do that
since it was hot,

1183
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:44,171
but my fashion
is more important. [chuckles]

1184
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:45,088
Right.

1185
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:46,381
[mellow music playing]

1186
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:47,466
It is important.

1187
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:50,469
I love how their conversation
is flowing smoothly. It's going great.

1188
00:48:50,552 --> 00:48:52,137
-I'm glad you have that.
-Thank you.

1189
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:55,098
I think the sun might
keep coming in from below the table.

1190
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:56,892
Thank you.

1191
00:48:57,476 --> 00:48:58,685
[Han-na] Oh, Hyun-kyu's happy.

1192
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:00,562
-[Car] He looks so happy.
-[Han-na] He does.

1193
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:02,147
[music fades]

1194
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:03,440
[waves lapping]

1195
00:49:03,523 --> 00:49:05,484
[Hyun-kyu] When you were playing
the claw machine,

1196
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:08,362
I was getting really nervous.

1197
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:10,447
Who went first?

1198
00:49:10,530 --> 00:49:12,240
I couldn't see the order.

1199
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:13,992
-You told us not to watch…
-Right.

1200
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:16,536
-…so I was standing like this before.
-But…

1201
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:21,208
Actually, the girls
talked about this last night.

1202
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:24,211
I was going back and forth
between two guys too.

1203
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:25,921
-[pensive music playing]
-[Hyun-kyu] Hmm.

1204
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:28,006
We just decided the order like that.

1205
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:30,592
-So--
-I'm curious now,

1206
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:32,636
since you say there were two. [chuckles]

1207
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:33,553
Me?

1208
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:36,098
-[Hyun-kyu] Mm-hmm.
-But I…

1209
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:40,560
I'll just… I'll tell you honestly.

1210
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:42,729
-I'm not good at beating around the bush.
-Okay.

1211
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:48,860
I have a pretty clear ideal type.

1212
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:53,281
I like guys who are manly,
both physically and mentally, so…

1213
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:57,869
So, I chose Sang-ho and you.

1214
00:49:59,162 --> 00:50:01,790
-I chose the two of you.
-Hmm.

1215
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:07,170
So, you're going back and forth
between me and Sang-ho then?

1216
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:08,255
Yeah.

1217
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:11,341
I…

1218
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:14,511
talked to you yesterday too, right? But…

1219
00:50:14,594 --> 00:50:17,097
I felt that I wanted to
talk to you some more,

1220
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:19,057
since we only had about ten minutes or so.

1221
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:20,392
[Hyun-kyu] Hmm.

1222
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:24,813
I really want a chance
to talk to the people I'm interested in.

1223
00:50:24,896 --> 00:50:27,899
-We have only so much time together.
-Right. That's right too.

1224
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:29,776
So I chose you.

1225
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:31,403
[cheerful music playing]

1226
00:50:31,486 --> 00:50:32,487
-Really?
-Yeah.

1227
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:35,031
-[In-guk] "Someone I want."
-[Han-na] Right. "And that's you."

1228
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:36,783
I was really scared, thinking,

1229
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:39,077
"What if she doesn't choose me
from the claw machine?"

1230
00:50:39,786 --> 00:50:41,788
If it hadn't been me,
you would've chosen Sang-ho.

1231
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:44,750
Then I would've been like,
"Time to drink some whiskey." So…

1232
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,210
-Right, instead of this…
-So, thank you.

1233
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:52,007
-Anyway, you're with her now. Good job.
-That's right. Ji-su chose Hyun-kyu.

1234
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:53,592
That's why I thought,

1235
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:57,721
"I wish the men were choosing their dates
instead of the women."

1236
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:01,850
Then my choice
would've been an obvious one.

1237
00:51:03,685 --> 00:51:05,520
[chuckling] What a load of bullshit.

1238
00:51:09,524 --> 00:51:10,609
[music fades]

1239
00:51:10,692 --> 00:51:13,487
-[Ji-su] I'm actually pretty silly.
-Okay.

1240
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:17,532
But it didn't seem like anyone here
would play along with me.

1241
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:18,742
[Hyun-kyu] Hmm.

1242
00:51:18,825 --> 00:51:20,869
-I'll play along.
-Oh, really?

1243
00:51:20,952 --> 00:51:21,870
Be silly with me.

1244
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:26,750
If I went up to you and said like,
"Princess, have you eaten?"

1245
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:27,876
[chuckling] What then?

1246
00:51:27,959 --> 00:51:29,419
[effeminately] Princess ate lunch.

1247
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:30,462
[chuckles]

1248
00:51:30,545 --> 00:51:34,591
[in normal voice] Oh, "Hey, look at him."
Everyone would be like, "Look at him!"

1249
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:36,301
[Han-na] Wow, Hyun-kyu is good.

1250
00:51:36,384 --> 00:51:38,678
And when I'm with my friends,
I do voice imitations.

1251
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:40,722
-What? Shin-chan?
-I imitate Shin-chan.

1252
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:43,308
[imitates Shin-chan] "Oh, a pretty lady."

1253
00:51:43,391 --> 00:51:45,977
[in normal voice] Like that.
You should try it. It's really easy.

1254
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:48,980
[imitates Shin-chan] "Oh, a pretty lady."
[in normal voice] Is that it?

1255
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:50,607
-Yeah, that's it.
-[chuckles]

1256
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:51,942
[Ji-su laughing heartily]

1257
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:53,109
[In-guk] Aww!

1258
00:51:53,193 --> 00:51:56,071
-Why are they so cute together?
-[Eun-ji] Their conversation's flowing.

1259
00:51:56,154 --> 00:51:58,240
[In-guk] Oh, my God. They're adorable!

1260
00:51:58,323 --> 00:52:00,534
-I've never heard Ji-su laugh so loudly.
-I know.

1261
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:03,829
That's true. And you can tell
that there aren't any awkward pauses.

1262
00:52:03,912 --> 00:52:06,289
[Car] Right, it's so comfortable
to watch them talk,

1263
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:07,374
-you know?
-[Han-na] Yeah.

1264
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:09,084
Whatever Ji-su does, Hyun-kyu loves it.

1265
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:11,711
Since he has good reactions,
Ji-su's laugh keeps getting louder.

1266
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:13,171
[charming music playing]

1267
00:52:13,255 --> 00:52:17,509
Ji-su was acting silly
and playing along with my jokes too,

1268
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:20,303
so she's definitely my top choice now.

1269
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:21,346
[imperceptible]

1270
00:52:21,429 --> 00:52:25,600
[Ji-su] Hyun-kyu was such a good sport
about how silly I was acting.

1271
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:30,856
I found out that he has this
kind of charm about him.

1272
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:35,569
[Ji-su] They say it's good to take a walk
after eating. Shall we take a walk?

1273
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:36,486
[Hyun-kyu] Right.

1274
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:38,572
[pleasant upbeat music playing]

1275
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:41,241
Okay, this is cool, we can go this way.

1276
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:44,286
-[Ji-su] Did you find a good route?
-Yeah. Yeah, let's go this way…

1277
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:47,622
-But be careful.
-Okay.

1278
00:52:51,793 --> 00:52:53,295
Be careful in spots like this.

1279
00:52:53,378 --> 00:52:54,421
[music fades]

1280
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:56,464
-Like here. Don't step here.
-Maybe hold her hand?

1281
00:52:56,548 --> 00:52:58,550
-[Han-na] Just take her hand!
-[Car] Hold her hand!

1282
00:52:58,633 --> 00:53:00,635
[quirky music playing]

1283
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:04,598
There's some water here.

1284
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:06,141
How about you extend your hand?

1285
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:09,644
-Watch out.
-[In-guk] He'll do it.

1286
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:12,480
-Just gently offer your hand.
-[Hyun-kyu] You can come this way.

1287
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:15,859
-[Eun-ji] How about you get closer?
-How about you don't walk too far ahead?

1288
00:53:15,942 --> 00:53:17,569
Oh, this is getting way too rough.

1289
00:53:17,652 --> 00:53:19,321
Then stop going!

1290
00:53:19,404 --> 00:53:20,488
[laughing]

1291
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:23,033
Why is he going there
when the path is too difficult?!

1292
00:53:23,116 --> 00:53:24,701
[Han-na] Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.

1293
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:26,786
[quirky music continues]

1294
00:53:30,832 --> 00:53:32,459
-Oh, here, here, it's here.
-But…

1295
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:33,543
[Hyun-kyu] What?

1296
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:35,503
I thought this is where
you'd hold my hand.

1297
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:38,214
-[Hyun-kyu] Oh. No, but…
-But you look unstable, so let's just go.

1298
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:39,799
So you should hold my hand then.

1299
00:53:39,883 --> 00:53:42,177
-[Ji-su laughing] Let's just go.
-Hold my hand for me.

1300
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:43,678
"Hold my hand for me"?

1301
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:45,805
You'll be eating Chapagetti soon, dude.

1302
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:47,933
You're hopeless.
You're another hopeless guy.

1303
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:49,851
-Should he get the water boiling?
-Yeah.

1304
00:53:49,935 --> 00:53:52,520
-They'll eat it together soon enough.
-God, seriously?

1305
00:53:52,604 --> 00:53:53,605
[exclaims]

1306
00:53:53,688 --> 00:53:56,524
-How could he say, "Hold my hand for me?"
-[Eun-ji] What do we do?

1307
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:57,651
[Ji-su grunts]

1308
00:53:57,734 --> 00:53:59,736
WHY DIDN'T YOU HOLD HER HAND?

1309
00:53:59,819 --> 00:54:04,199
I just thought she was the kind of person
who wants to do things on her own.

1310
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:07,160
She was really brave,
so I figured she'd think, like,

1311
00:54:07,243 --> 00:54:09,454
"I can do it myself. I don't need help."

1312
00:54:09,537 --> 00:54:13,249
So I just thought she could hold my hand
to support me instead.

1313
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:15,669
-I was hurt.
-I'll hold your hand.

1314
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:17,879
I think it's better if I hold yours.

1315
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:19,089
[quirky music playing]

1316
00:54:19,172 --> 00:54:20,382
Then hold my hand.

1317
00:54:20,465 --> 00:54:22,133
[Ji-su] Okay, fine. I'll do it next time.

1318
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:23,843
[Hyun-kyu laughs]

1319
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:26,137
[Car] Both Hyun-kyu and Sang-ho…

1320
00:54:26,721 --> 00:54:28,807
-Ji-su said this several times.
-Yeah.

1321
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:31,309
If I were Ji-su, I'd have been like…

1322
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:35,522
"Do they not remember anything I said?"

1323
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:36,439
[Cupids laughing]

1324
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:39,651
"I clearly said that I liked manly men.
I said so several times."

1325
00:54:39,734 --> 00:54:41,778
And she likes a man
who expresses himself clearly.

1326
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:43,947
These guys say in their interviews

1327
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:45,573
-they think they did well.
-I know!

1328
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:48,702
-"As of now, she's my top choice."
-Look how Hyun-kyu is so proud of himself.

1329
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:50,620
Things were
working out well for him earlier.

1330
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:52,914
But I still think that
Sang-ho and Hyun-kyu

1331
00:54:52,998 --> 00:54:54,874
must've been tied for first place.

1332
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:57,002
-Not 93 and 95 anymore.
-Maybe.

1333
00:54:57,085 --> 00:54:59,170
She'll wanna keep observing them
since they're tied.

1334
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:00,088
[Eun-ji] Yeah.

1335
00:55:00,171 --> 00:55:02,257
KIM SANG-HO
KIM SEUNG-LI

1336
00:55:04,759 --> 00:55:06,302
[breathing heavily]

1337
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:09,431
[Sang-ho] I was so tired after that,
so I thought I could get some sleep.

1338
00:55:09,514 --> 00:55:10,640
[melancholic music playing]

1339
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:13,560
But I'd had some coffee before,
so I couldn't even nap.

1340
00:55:15,603 --> 00:55:17,605
I guess he wanted to get some good rest.

1341
00:55:18,606 --> 00:55:20,191
Since he can't go on a date.

1342
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:22,068
-[In-guk] Wow.
-I'm tired.

1343
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:28,283
He's really boiling water.
He's really boiling water.

1344
00:55:28,366 --> 00:55:29,576
[Han-na] Wait, what?

1345
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:32,162
-[Han-na] No way! He's having Chapagetti!
-What should I eat?

1346
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:35,081
If he's doing that… Did he watch
our commentary before we finished it?

1347
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:37,459
[Eun-ji] Jeez. I mean,
were you in their room with us?

1348
00:55:37,542 --> 00:55:38,418
[laughs]

1349
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:40,211
-[Han-na] What is this?
-He just seems so…

1350
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:43,048
He reminds me so much
of myself sometimes. Oh, my God.

1351
00:55:43,131 --> 00:55:44,132
Wow.

1352
00:55:44,215 --> 00:55:46,217
[whimsical music playing]

1353
00:55:51,264 --> 00:55:54,184
Why have salad with your ramyeon?
That's just eating more.

1354
00:55:54,267 --> 00:55:55,769
[Han-na] He's having a hearty meal.

1355
00:55:58,646 --> 00:55:59,689
[music fades]

1356
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:02,484
[Sang-ho] I didn't know when I'd eat next.

1357
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:04,736
Whether I'd get to go
on a date for dinner or not,

1358
00:56:04,819 --> 00:56:06,905
I had to wait anyway,
and I was craving ramyeon.

1359
00:56:06,988 --> 00:56:08,990
[contemplative piano music playing]

1360
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:16,831
[slurping]

1361
00:56:34,933 --> 00:56:36,309
What could he be thinking?

1362
00:56:37,268 --> 00:56:38,269
[music fades]

1363
00:56:39,687 --> 00:56:42,190
-He probably wants to add some rice.
-[laughing] Right, right.

1364
00:56:42,273 --> 00:56:43,441
[In-guk] He would think that.

1365
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:46,277
-Yes, "Should I? Or shouldn't I?"
-"Should I? Or shouldn't I?"

1366
00:56:46,945 --> 00:56:48,446
[Sang-ho slurping loudly]

1367
00:56:48,530 --> 00:56:49,906
[Han-na] And it's raining too.

1368
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:51,407
[continues slurping]

1369
00:56:52,033 --> 00:56:53,076
[wistful music playing]

1370
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:56,996
[Sang-ho] Eating ramyeon as I looked out
at the rain… It felt pretty lonely.

1371
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:59,249
Is he crying? Oh, it's just sweat.

1372
00:57:01,292 --> 00:57:02,836
[Sang-ho] I wasn't drinking alcohol.

1373
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:06,881
But I felt like
I was having soju with my ramyeon.

1374
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:11,928
-[Car] You should try and do better.
-[Han-na] He's cute.

1375
00:57:15,265 --> 00:57:16,808
And then, once I was full,

1376
00:57:16,891 --> 00:57:19,060
I felt like I had gained some weight
since coming here,

1377
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:21,354
because I've been drinking and stuff.

1378
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:24,274
I wanted to maintain my physique,
so I worked out a little.

1379
00:57:24,357 --> 00:57:26,109
[energetic music playing]

1380
00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:28,236
-[grunts]
-Oh, nice!

1381
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,571
[breathing heavily]

1382
00:57:39,372 --> 00:57:40,540

-[Cupids laughing]
-[amusing music playing]

1387
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:02,270
Oh, he couldn't get on it smoothly.

1388
00:58:03,229 --> 00:58:05,523
[Sang-ho grunts softly] What the hell?

1389
00:58:06,566 --> 00:58:09,360
Sang-ho, at least
you're giving people a good laugh.

1390
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:11,112
He's getting so much screen time.

1391
00:58:11,196 --> 00:58:12,280
[Eun-ji exclaims]

1392
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:16,910
[Car] Cover your face.
Don't wanna get too much sunlight.

ONE-ON-ONE DATE
YI DO & SEUNG-LI

1395
00:58:20,705 --> 00:58:22,207
[Eun-ji] It's Do and Seung-li's date.

1396
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:24,959
-[Do] Have you ever done this before?
-[Seung-li] Surfing? Wow, no.

1397
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:27,003
This is my first time,
it sounds really fun.

1398
00:58:27,086 --> 00:58:29,088
[enchanting music playing]

1399
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:30,673
[imperceptible]

1400
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:33,593
I was so excited,
and I was thinking, like,

1401
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:36,888
"I finally get to talk
to Seung-li for a long time,"

1402
00:58:36,971 --> 00:58:38,556
so I was really happy.

1403
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,099
Do you like stuff like that?

1404
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:41,643
-I totally love it.
-Oh, really?

1405
00:58:41,726 --> 00:58:43,186
-I prefer extreme sports over…
-Yeah.

1406
00:58:43,269 --> 00:58:45,104
…going to cafes or something.

1407
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:47,232
I like cafes too.

1408
00:58:47,315 --> 00:58:49,609
-Oh, cafes too? I'm good either way.
-Yeah, I like both.

1409
00:58:52,278 --> 00:58:55,365
-The scenery changed all of a sudden.
-[Do] Right?

1410
00:58:55,448 --> 00:58:57,992
-[Seung-li] Weather is so typical of Jeju.
-[Do] It's perfect.

1411
00:58:58,743 --> 00:59:00,411
[Seung-li] We should've come here sooner.

1414
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:06,376
-I'm not afraid of the water.
-[Do] Me neither.

00:59:09,921 --> 00:59:12,298
-Here comes his secret weapon!
-[In-guk] What?

1418
00:59:13,258 --> 00:59:16,344
And we know our Do
likes guys with good physiques.

1419
00:59:17,804 --> 00:59:19,514
He sure is from Brazil.

1420
00:59:19,597 --> 00:59:20,431
[Car chuckles]

1421
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:24,561
[Seung-li] I've exercised
more than the other contestants,

1422
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:28,147
so I figured, "I probably look better,"
and took my shirt off.

1423
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:31,859
[softly] 28, 29, 30…

1424
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:34,445
I think I did about

1425
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:38,783
400 push-ups in 15 minutes or so. Yeah.

1426

-[Han-na] Oh, a puppy! So cute!
-[In-guk] So cute.

[whimsical music playing]

1430
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:50,628
Even his necklace
makes him look like The Rock.

1431
00:59:52,505 --> 00:59:53,464
Hello.

1432
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:54,924
[enchanting music playing]

1433
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:55,842
Hello.

1434
00:59:59,971 --> 01:00:01,097
[Do] I couldn't look at him.

1435
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:03,600
I was too shy. I just kept thinking,

1436
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:05,226
"Wow, he's so hot."

1437
01:00:06,227 --> 01:00:07,061
Shall we?

1438
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:13,568
My belly is a little chubby right now.

1439
01:00:13,651 --> 01:00:15,945
[Do chuckles] What if you suck it in?

1440
01:00:16,029 --> 01:00:18,448
-[Seung-li] I tried, but it didn't work.
-Oh, really?

1441
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:20,366
[Seung-li] We're suddenly
speaking formally.

1442
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:21,826
[Do] You're right. [chuckles]

1443
01:00:21,909 --> 01:00:24,245
[Seung-li] Maybe we're just
feeling awkward in swimsuits.

1444
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:25,288
[Do] Right.

1445
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:30,501
[gasps] Wow, it's so pretty.

1446
01:00:31,502 --> 01:00:33,087
-[Seung-li] Wow.
-[upbeat music playing]

1447
01:00:33,171 --> 01:00:36,007
-[Do] Isn't the color so beautiful?
-[Seung-li] Yeah.

1448
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:37,925
Hello.

1449
01:00:38,009 --> 01:00:39,886
-[instructor] Hi, guys!
-[Do] Nice to meet you.

1450
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:43,514
We're going to do
paddle yoga together today.

PADDLEBOARD YOGA

1452
01:00:44,682 --> 01:00:47,352
Get on top of your surfboards
and have a seat.

1453
01:00:47,435 --> 01:00:48,853
I'll explain everything.

1454
01:00:50,021 --> 01:00:50,980
[music fades]

1455
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:52,398
Namaste.

1456
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:53,650
[Do] Namaste.

1457
01:00:54,859 --> 01:00:56,194
Namaste.

1458
01:00:58,696 --> 01:01:02,200
[instructor] Push down
on the left side of your head gently.

1459
01:01:02,283 --> 01:01:06,913
If you can, straighten your knee
all the way to make the Navasana pose.

1460
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:09,874
-Oh, good. Breathe three times.
-[groans]

1461
01:01:09,957 --> 01:01:12,251
-Doesn't this hurt?
-One, two, straighten your knees.

1462
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:14,379
Let's try it
while you're helping each other.

1463
01:01:14,462 --> 01:01:16,881
Seung-li, will you move over this way?

1464
01:01:16,964 --> 01:01:18,341
-[Seung-li] Me?
-[instructor] Yes.

1465
01:01:18,424 --> 01:01:20,176
Please sit as you face each other.

1466
01:01:20,259 --> 01:01:23,221
Oh, but they're still a bit…
It's still awkward. They must feel shy.

1467
01:01:23,304 --> 01:01:25,139
[Han-na] Oh, my. That's too close.

1468
01:01:25,223 --> 01:01:27,642
Just like that, but a little closer.

1469
01:01:27,725 --> 01:01:30,770
Come closer and there will be
some physical contact. Is that okay?

1470
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:32,980
No, that's not okay.

1471
01:01:33,064 --> 01:01:35,400
[instructor] It's just a bit.
So, bend your knees

1472
01:01:35,483 --> 01:01:36,984
and prepare for the boat pose.

1473
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:39,153
[whimsical music playing]

1474
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:41,948
[Do] I felt so embarrassed.

1475
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:45,201
So I couldn't even
turn my head or look in his direction.

1476
01:01:46,577 --> 01:01:50,164
Come a little closer
and put your feet together.

1477
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:52,709
Is that okay?

1478
01:01:54,252 --> 01:01:57,547
-[instructor laughs] Are you all right?
-No. [chuckles]

1479
01:01:57,630 --> 01:02:00,049
[instructor] Is that not okay? All right.

1480
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:03,761
Okay, now put your feet together,

1481
01:02:03,845 --> 01:02:05,680
-hold each other's hands.
-This really tickles

1482
01:02:05,763 --> 01:02:07,849
when you
put your feet together like this, right?

1483
01:02:07,932 --> 01:02:09,350
-[instructor] Does it?
-[both] Yeah.

1484
01:02:09,434 --> 01:02:11,436
Okay, so hold each other's hands.

1485
01:02:11,519 --> 01:02:12,395
Hmm.

1486
01:02:12,478 --> 01:02:13,730
[instructor] Are you okay?

1487
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:15,106
[upbeat music playing]

1488
01:02:15,189 --> 01:02:16,607
-Feel okay?
-[Do chuckles]

1489
01:02:16,691 --> 01:02:17,984
[instructor] Straighten one leg.

1490
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:22,113
Okay, and lift the foot
on the outside at the same time.

1491
01:02:23,281 --> 01:02:25,241
-[Do] The outside?
-The outside? This one?

1492
01:02:25,324 --> 01:02:28,953
Okay, let's lift that side first.
Straighten your knees, all the way.

1493
01:02:29,036 --> 01:02:31,330
If I straighten it all the way,
she might fly off.

1494
01:02:31,414 --> 01:02:32,540
[Do screams, chuckles]

1495
01:02:33,499 --> 01:02:34,751
-[instructor] Again.
-Like that.

1496
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:36,669
[instructor] Put your feet together.
Up, up.

1497
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:38,921
[both screaming]

1498
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:40,840
Good, look at each other.

1499
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:42,550
-[Do] I can't see him.
-Navasana.

1500
01:02:43,426 --> 01:02:45,428
How about a little smile, guys?

1501
01:02:45,511 --> 01:02:47,054
Shall we smile? One…

1502
01:02:47,138 --> 01:02:49,015
-[Seung-li] I think I'm getting a cramp.
-…two…

1503
01:02:49,098 --> 01:02:52,018
One more time, one last smile.

1504
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:53,436
[instructor laughs]

1505
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:57,940
Slowly, bend one knee at a time,
and come down. Great job.

1506
01:02:58,983 --> 01:03:00,818
-Namaste.
-[Do and Seung-li] Namaste.

1507
01:03:01,736 --> 01:03:02,820
[Seung-li] Thank you.

1508
01:03:02,904 --> 01:03:03,946
[music fades]

1509
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:05,907
-Wanna go in the water?
-[Do] Shall we?

1510
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:07,200
[upbeat Korean song playing]

1511
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:09,243
[Do in English] It's too cold. It's scary.

1512
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:11,621
You just have to get wet,
like this. Right, like this.

1513
01:03:11,704 --> 01:03:13,372
-[Do] Don't do that!
-You should dunk.

1514
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:15,500
-[yelps]
-Come here, come here, come here.

1515
01:03:15,583 --> 01:03:17,960
[Car] "Come here, come here,
come here." That's good.

1516
01:03:18,044 --> 01:03:19,003
[Han-na squeals]

1517
01:03:19,086 --> 01:03:21,047
-[Han-na] Oh, my. They held hands.
-It's not deep.

1518
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:23,174
-[Han-na] Help her stand.
-[Eun-ji] Help her up.

1519
01:03:23,257 --> 01:03:25,134
-[In-guk] Help her up.
-[Car] Okay.

1520
01:03:26,093 --> 01:03:28,346
Playing in the water
is a good way to get close.

1521
01:03:28,429 --> 01:03:30,473
-[Eun-ji] True, true.
-[screaming]

1522
01:03:30,556 --> 01:03:31,474
Oh, my!

1523
01:03:31,557 --> 01:03:33,351
-[screaming]
-[laughing]

1524
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:36,187
Hey, watch out. Stop that.

1525
01:03:36,270 --> 01:03:37,271
[screams]

1526
01:03:37,355 --> 01:03:38,481
[giggles]

1527
01:03:38,564 --> 01:03:39,982
Oh, Do looks happy.

1528
01:03:40,066 --> 01:03:41,400
She's giggling so much.

1529
01:03:43,611 --> 01:03:45,071
[Cupids exclaim]

1530
01:03:46,197 --> 01:03:47,323
[Do exclaims]

1531
01:03:47,406 --> 01:03:49,617
You really like extreme activities.

1532
01:03:50,326 --> 01:03:53,830
Actually, I really wanted
to go on a date with Seung-li,

1533
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:57,458
so I was gonna have fun,
no matter what we were doing.

1534
01:03:58,417 --> 01:04:01,003
-[Seung-li] Should we get going now?
-You wanna leave?

1535
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:04,090
-[Seung-li] No, let's keep having fun!
-No. Let's go.

1536
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:05,633
[Do yelps, chuckles]

1537
01:04:07,468 --> 01:04:09,470
[Seung-li] The weather is so nice today.

1538
01:04:09,554 --> 01:04:11,681
-[Do] Right? The water felt amazing.
-It was great.

1539
01:04:11,764 --> 01:04:13,432
[Do] The color was so pretty.

1540
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:15,643
[Car] They're speaking casually now too.

1541
01:04:15,726 --> 01:04:16,644
[Seung-li] Hi.

1542
01:04:17,144 --> 01:04:18,729
-[Do] Hello.
-[man] Welcome.

1543
01:04:18,813 --> 01:04:20,690
[Do] The mood here is amazing.

1544
01:04:21,274 --> 01:04:22,483
And here are your drinks.

1545
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:23,818
-[Do] Okay.
-Thank you.

1546
01:04:23,901 --> 01:04:25,319
-[man] Enjoy.
-[Do giggles]

1547
01:04:26,153 --> 01:04:27,697
-Oh, thank you.
-Yep.

1548
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:31,868
Oh, can you teach me
how to say "thank you" in Portuguese?

1549
01:04:31,951 --> 01:04:33,077
-In Portuguese?
-Yeah.

1550
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:34,120
-Obrigado.
-What?

1551
01:04:34,203 --> 01:04:35,037
Obrigado.

1552
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:36,914
-Is the "do" silent?
-Try it.

1553
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:38,624
Obrigado. No.

1554
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:41,043
Obrigado. Obrigado…

1555
01:04:41,127 --> 01:04:43,546
Ga… The "gado" part has to be soft.

1556
01:04:46,674 --> 01:04:49,719
What do you care about the most?
Appearance, personality,

1557
01:04:50,761 --> 01:04:51,596
charm?

1558
01:04:53,014 --> 01:04:56,142
-If you had to choose one of the three.
-I used to…

1559
01:04:56,225 --> 01:04:58,394
-I used to think it was appearance…
-Okay.

1560
01:04:58,477 --> 01:04:59,937
…but maybe not?

1561
01:05:00,021 --> 01:05:01,063
Oh.

1562
01:05:02,773 --> 01:05:05,234
But aren't most people like that?

1563
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:07,570
They want to date someone good-looking.

1564
01:05:10,364 --> 01:05:11,449
I'm like that too.

1565
01:05:12,366 --> 01:05:13,409
I think so.

1566
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:18,247
Then tell me, who was it?
Your first impression pick.

1567
01:05:19,373 --> 01:05:21,250
-My first impression pick?
-Yeah.

1568
01:05:23,377 --> 01:05:26,088
We can't… I can't tell you that.

1569
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:28,090
Why not? No, you can tell me.

1570
01:05:28,883 --> 01:05:30,301
-Well…
-Yeah?

1571
01:05:30,384 --> 01:05:32,428
I'll say "No comment." [chuckles]

1572
01:05:37,141 --> 01:05:39,602
I don't think the guys are telling anyone.

1573
01:05:39,685 --> 01:05:43,064
I know. Everyone seems to be
secretive and quiet.

1574
01:05:43,147 --> 01:05:45,900
-Everyone's just trying to be private.
-"Acting discreetly?"

1575
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:48,277
Well, maybe not me,
but I think the others are.

1576
01:05:48,361 --> 01:05:49,362
Oh, really?

1577
01:05:52,156 --> 01:05:53,240
I see.

1578
01:05:56,827 --> 01:05:57,662
Everyone…

1579
01:05:59,914 --> 01:06:01,791
-Did you get that thing?
-They just stay quiet…

1580
01:06:01,874 --> 01:06:03,834
Did you get anything in your mailbox?

1581
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:09,924
-Yeah, but I can't tell who it's from.
-You got it?

1582
01:06:10,508 --> 01:06:13,552
Well, it only had my name on it.
"To Seung-li."

1583
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:14,470
[Do] Hmm.

1584
01:06:15,137 --> 01:06:19,725
I kept reading it, but, "Who's it from?
Who's it from?" I kept trying to guess.

1585
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:22,561
[solemn music playing]

1586
01:06:23,729 --> 01:06:28,317
I thought,
if he'd been paying attention to me,

1587
01:06:28,401 --> 01:06:32,405
he'd pretty easily guess
that it was from me.

1588
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:34,699
The envelope was pink,

1589
01:06:34,782 --> 01:06:38,786
and I'm always going on
about chocolate, so…

1590
01:06:39,704 --> 01:06:43,624
"This will be pretty obvious."
That was what I thought.

1591
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:44,959
[solemn music continues]

1592
01:06:45,042 --> 01:06:46,961
Who could it be from? God.

1593
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:52,008
[Do] So, at the time,

1594
01:06:52,091 --> 01:06:55,302
I felt like my heart
was breaking into pieces.

1595
01:06:57,263 --> 01:06:59,390
As I was on the date with Do,

1596
01:07:00,307 --> 01:07:03,686
I thought, "Do must've
written the letter to me, right?"

1597
01:07:04,353 --> 01:07:07,815
I had an idea,
but I felt more grateful than excited.

1598
01:07:07,898 --> 01:07:10,192
If it had been from Ji-su,

1599
01:07:10,276 --> 01:07:11,902
I would've been just so excited.

1600
01:07:11,986 --> 01:07:14,155
So I kept feigning ignorance.

1601
01:07:14,238 --> 01:07:16,407
-Because he's not into her.
-[Car] He's not interested.

1602
01:07:16,490 --> 01:07:18,909
She's not the one he likes.
Is that why he didn't mention it?

1603
01:07:18,993 --> 01:07:20,995
-[Car] Oh, yeah.
-And that's the right thing to do…

1604
01:07:21,078 --> 01:07:22,747
-Right, rather than…
-Being clear. Yeah.

1605
01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:23,873
…giving her false hope

1606
01:07:23,956 --> 01:07:26,792
-when he isn't into her. Right.
-[Eun-ji] Instead of giving false hope.

1607
01:07:28,085 --> 01:07:29,754
[Do] I had so much fun today.

1608
01:07:30,337 --> 01:07:31,672
[Seung-li] I had fun too.

1609
01:07:33,966 --> 01:07:35,926
Should we take our time to get back?

1610
01:07:37,136 --> 01:07:39,430
I'm going like ten kilometers an hour.

1611
01:07:39,513 --> 01:07:40,556
[both chuckle]

1612
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:42,558
It might be faster to walk.

1613
01:07:46,353 --> 01:07:49,523
By the way, what's your ideal type?

1614
01:07:51,484 --> 01:07:52,902
In terms of looks?

1615
01:07:52,985 --> 01:07:55,279
-My ideal type?
-Yeah, appearance-wise.

1616
01:07:55,362 --> 01:07:56,947
First of all…

1617
01:07:58,574 --> 01:08:01,827
I like people with a certain vibe.
Someone with a cold aura.

1618
01:08:02,328 --> 01:08:04,789
-Kind of hard to approach?
-Yeah, hard to approach.

1619
01:08:04,872 --> 01:08:06,165
Like a cat?

1620
01:08:06,248 --> 01:08:09,210
Yeah, I guess someone who's like a cat.
Yeah, like a cat.

1621
01:08:09,293 --> 01:08:10,294
Oh.

1622
01:08:12,546 --> 01:08:14,632
[pensive music playing]

1623
01:08:14,715 --> 01:08:19,804
Someone who's first impression
is hard to approach like a cat?

1624
01:08:20,721 --> 01:08:22,890
That reminded me of Ji-su right away.

1625
01:08:22,973 --> 01:08:26,644
And Seung-li's answer
was far from my image.

1626
01:08:26,727 --> 01:08:31,107
"I'm having so much fun right now,
but he might not feel the same."

1627
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:36,570
And, "Seung-li might have wanted
to be chosen by someone else."

1628
01:08:37,154 --> 01:08:39,532
That made my heart break even more.

1629
01:08:45,204 --> 01:08:46,163
[music fades]

1630
01:08:46,247 --> 01:08:47,665
-But, you know…
-Yeah?

1631
01:08:47,748 --> 01:08:49,291
You mentioned that…

1632
01:08:51,168 --> 01:08:53,295
there was someone you were interested in,

1633
01:08:53,379 --> 01:08:54,380
-right?
-Yeah.

1634
01:08:55,923 --> 01:08:58,217
But what if that person
likes someone else?

1635
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:01,887
Say that he likes someone else.
How do you think you'd feel?

1636
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:03,055
[Do] Mmm.

1637
01:09:04,431 --> 01:09:05,808
Just sad.

1638
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:08,018
[Seung-li] Hmm.

1639
01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:13,357
Sad.

1640
01:09:13,899 --> 01:09:15,234
Not great.

1641
01:09:15,317 --> 01:09:17,486
Of course.
I asked you something too obvious.

1642
01:09:17,570 --> 01:09:18,404
Right.

1643
01:09:25,035 --> 01:09:26,120
But I…

1644
01:09:28,914 --> 01:09:31,542
I usually just give up, you know?

1645
01:09:31,625 --> 01:09:33,794
-Yeah?
-But…

1646
01:09:33,878 --> 01:09:35,379
Can you not give up this time?

1647
01:09:35,462 --> 01:09:36,505
Will you

1648
01:09:36,589 --> 01:09:37,882
just go for it?

1649
01:09:37,965 --> 01:09:39,341
I'm gonna try

1650
01:09:39,425 --> 01:09:40,467
to not give up.

1651
01:09:40,551 --> 01:09:42,303
-[Eun-ji gasps]
-[In-guk and Han-na exclaim]

1652
01:09:42,386 --> 01:09:43,304
Aw, Do!

1653
01:09:43,387 --> 01:09:45,139
[In-guk] That was so cool.

1654
01:09:45,222 --> 01:09:46,974
[hopeful music playing]

1655
01:09:48,142 --> 01:09:50,186
-[Do] Now that I think about it, I'm like…
-Yeah.

1656
01:09:50,269 --> 01:09:51,812
"Yeah, I came all this way."

1657
01:09:51,896 --> 01:09:53,355
-Yeah.
-"There's nothing I can't do."

1658
01:09:54,356 --> 01:09:56,358
Wow, I'm learning a lot from you.

1659
01:09:56,442 --> 01:09:58,569
"There's nothing I can't do."
When I heard that--

1660
01:09:58,652 --> 01:10:01,197
-No, don't learn from me.
-No, I will do that.

1661
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:03,032
-No, don't.
-Later at night…

1662
01:10:03,115 --> 01:10:05,159
-No, don't learn from me.

1663
01:10:08,078 --> 01:10:09,121
[turn signal clicking]

1664
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:10,206
[Do sighs]

1665
01:10:11,498 --> 01:10:13,500
[mellow music playing]

1666
01:10:21,425 --> 01:10:27,181
How could I resent Seung-li
when Seung-li was so, so nice to me today?

1667
01:10:27,264 --> 01:10:31,310
He was well-mannered,
and we had nice conversations.

1668
01:10:31,894 --> 01:10:32,811
But

1669
01:10:33,771 --> 01:10:35,898
it did hurt me a lot.

1670
01:10:36,565 --> 01:10:42,029
I caught on that
he wasn't interested in me, so,

1671
01:10:42,988 --> 01:10:47,076
having to keep going on the date
seemed really cruel.

1672
01:10:47,785 --> 01:10:50,412
So, I couldn't really look at Seung-li.

1673
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:52,873
I felt like I was going to cry.

1674
01:10:52,957 --> 01:10:53,832
[chuckles softly]

1675
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:55,918
I just… just felt upset,

1676
01:10:56,001 --> 01:11:00,005
so I kept trying to focus
on something else.

1677
01:11:01,924 --> 01:11:03,008
[chuckling softly]

1678
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:04,176
[music fades]

1679
01:11:06,887 --> 01:11:07,846
[sniffles]

1680
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:11,392
[voice breaking] What do I do?

1681
01:11:12,726 --> 01:11:14,561
[chuckling, crying]

1682
01:11:17,189 --> 01:11:18,065
[sniffles]

1683
01:11:18,148 --> 01:11:19,858
[melancholic music playing]

1684
01:11:21,193 --> 01:11:22,361
[chuckling]

1685
01:11:24,154 --> 01:11:27,199
"Why couldn't he guess
the letter was from me?"

1686
01:11:28,575 --> 01:11:31,370
That thought crossed my mind too, and…

1687
01:11:34,665 --> 01:11:36,292
Oh, it was just so…

1688
01:11:38,335 --> 01:11:40,170
I was disappointed. [chuckles]

1689
01:11:41,922 --> 01:11:42,881
[sniffles]

1690
01:11:46,427 --> 01:11:47,261
[music fades]

1691
01:11:47,344 --> 01:11:50,055
She must've thought
he wasn't interested in her at all.

1692
01:11:50,973 --> 01:11:53,225
It must have hurt her pride too,
to be honest.

1693
01:11:53,976 --> 01:11:56,562
Will Do have a change of heart?
What do you think?

1694
01:11:56,645 --> 01:11:58,647
[Eun-ji] I think Do
won't give up so easily.

1695
01:11:58,731 --> 01:12:00,774
But if, right about now,

1696
01:12:01,734 --> 01:12:05,404
Jeong-mok were to
approach her and comfort her

1697
01:12:05,487 --> 01:12:08,866
-while she's feeling vulnerable and hurt…
-[In-guk] Right.

1698
01:12:08,949 --> 01:12:11,827
-…we don't know what could happen.
-[Car] True.

1699
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:13,829
So, this could be a chance for Jeong-mok,

1700
01:12:13,912 --> 01:12:16,415
-depending on how he chooses to act.
-[In-guk] That's right.

1701
01:12:16,498 --> 01:12:17,666
[inhales deeply]

1702
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:18,709

1706
01:12:30,721 --> 01:12:31,889

1707
01:12:37,728 --> 01:12:38,729
[cell phone chimes]

1708
01:12:40,397 --> 01:12:42,566
PLEASE GET READY TO LEAVE
AND GO TO THE ADDRESS BELOW

1709
01:12:42,649 --> 01:12:43,734
[sighs heavily]

1710
01:12:43,817 --> 01:12:45,819
[groovy music playing]

1711
01:12:49,323 --> 01:12:50,157
[groans]

1712
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:51,575
[Sang-ho] By four o'clock?

1713
01:12:51,658 --> 01:12:52,659
[sighing]

1714
01:12:54,203 --> 01:12:56,372
I got a text telling me
to get ready to go out.

1715
01:12:57,289 --> 01:13:00,209
When I saw the name of the location,
I wasn't really sure.

1716
01:13:00,292 --> 01:13:03,087
I was like, "What is this place?"
It looked kind of like a restaurant.

1717
01:13:03,712 --> 01:13:04,546
Is it, like…

1718
01:13:05,714 --> 01:13:07,549
Car, the garden, my Cupid?

1719
01:13:07,633 --> 01:13:09,343
I thought maybe
it was a counseling session

1720
01:13:09,426 --> 01:13:12,096
with someone special or something.
Or maybe an event?

1721
01:13:13,097 --> 01:13:15,891
It's not like I wasn't chosen
in the final pick,

1722
01:13:15,974 --> 01:13:18,435
but since I had a bad result
earlier on today,

1723
01:13:18,519 --> 01:13:22,106
I figured I could get some counseling
to improve and try again.

-[breathes deeply] Hmm.

1727
01:13:40,499 --> 01:13:43,001
-[Car] Who's that?
-[Han-na] Someone's there. Is that Ji-su?

1728
01:13:53,595 --> 01:13:55,431
-[gasps] Could it be someone new?
-[Car] What?

1729
01:13:55,514 --> 01:13:56,640
[In-guk] Isn't it Ji-su?

1730
01:13:58,517 --> 01:13:59,435
[Sang-ho] Hi.

1731
01:14:00,477 --> 01:14:01,353
[music fades]

1732
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:02,938
[woman in Japanese] Hello. [chuckles]

1733

[In-guk, Han-na and Car exclaim]

1734
01:14:09,862 --> 01:14:11,488
[woman in Japanese] Hello. [chuckles]

1735
01:14:17,870 --> 01:14:18,787
Nice to meet you.
