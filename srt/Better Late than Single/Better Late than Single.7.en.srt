DAYTIME SECRET DATES
CHOSEN BY THE MEN

3
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:15,515
So, I… like you too much.

4
00:00:15,598 --> 00:00:17,517
Me? You like me?

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,893
-Yeah.
-I see.

6
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:22,147
[Yeo-myung] I thought
it was nice that he was taking his time

7
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:24,858
to confess his feelings for me.

8
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:27,026
-How many…
-Mmm?

9
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:28,903
…dates do you think you'll have today?

10
00:00:28,987 --> 00:00:30,488
I just want one.

11
00:00:30,572 --> 00:00:31,865
-Oh!
-[chuckles]

12
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:36,286
[Do] Oh, this guy continuously
expresses his feelings to me.

13
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:39,414
I should take this… very seriously.

14
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:41,624
So are you still thinking? Still?

15
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:45,587
-You can't stop worrying? Hmm.
-I think I've pretty much made up my mind.

16
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:47,964
I'm not thinking too much.

17
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:49,591
-I'm not worrying either.
-Mmm.

18
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:51,760
So, if you're worried about that,

19
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,012
I'll give it my best shot.

20
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:56,848
-Your best shot?
-If… if you give me that chance, I will.

21
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:57,932
-[Ji-su] Mmm.
-[chuckles]

22
00:00:58,016 --> 00:01:01,061
[Hyun-kyu] The more I talked to her,
the more interested I became.

23
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:03,772
I think… I think she's the one.

24
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,900
[wistful music playing]

25
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:10,445
[Ji-yeon] Well… [sighs]

26
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:13,573
I didn't really have anyone
I wanted to see,

27
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:16,117
so I just wanted to leave soon.

28
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:21,998
[Mi-ji] I did think that
there's a chance nobody chose me.

29
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,793
[Min-hong] There isn't anything
I can do about this

30
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:28,338
and I said what I wanted to say
without any regrets.

31
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:31,549
So I don't need to feel sad or happy
because I'm at peace with it.

32
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,343
I do still have feelings for Jeong-mok.

33
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:36,095
If I like him, I like him.
I should keep fighting.

34
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:41,768
[Eun-ji] Now, the women
have to choose their dates for the night.

35
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:44,729
Then, that means Jeong-mok
might have other dates besides Do.

36
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:46,147
-He will.
-[Han-na] He's popular.

37
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:48,483
-There's Yeo-myung and Min-hong as well.
-[Eun-ji] Yes.

38
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:52,028
And I'm so curious to see
if Ji-su will end up going with Seung-li.

39
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:53,738
-True. That is important.
-[Eun-ji] Yeah.

40
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:56,491
I've been thinking a lot
about these night dates and…

41
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:57,408
-Yeah.
-[Car] Yes.

42
00:01:57,492 --> 00:01:58,368
-I'm curious…
-Yeah.

43
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:02,455
-…to see where Jeong-mok and Ji-su end up.
-Right. We'll have to watch and see.

44
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:04,332
-[mellow music playing]
-[sighs]

45
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,459
[exhales]

46
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:08,545
[Seung-li] Man, I was waiting and…

47
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:11,714
I was thinking,
"Will someone come or not?"

48
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:15,176
[Sang-ho] Ji-su gave me hope. You know,
it's not like she doesn't like me at all.

49
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:18,388
[Hyun-kyu] I think the important part
was whether she would choose me.

50
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,849
[Seung-chan] Anyway,
my top choice was Yeo-myung.

51
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:23,518
[Jae-yun] I wanted to
talk to her one-on-one.

52
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:25,603
[upbeat music playing]

53
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,532
[Han-na] Will the girls
who liked Jeong-mok before

54
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:39,450
still want to pick Jeong-mok?

55
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:40,952
[Eun-ji] He'll have so many dates.

56
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:43,788
[Car] Is it Yeo-myung?

57
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:45,540
[In-guk] Or Do?

58
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,501
[music fades]

59
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:49,419
[woman] Hi.

60
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:52,338
-Huh?
-[Eun-ji] Why is he so surprised?

61
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:53,298
[Han-na] Who is it?

62
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:54,966
-Hi.
-[Jeong-mok] Oh.

63
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:56,259
-[Car] Ji-yeon!
-[Han-na] What?

64
00:02:56,342 --> 00:02:57,343
Didn't expect me, huh?

65
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,888
-Ji-yeon? Jeong-mok?
-[In-guk] Ji-yeon!

66
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:00,930
-Sit down.
-Yeah.

67
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,307
SECRET DATE
JEONG-MOK & JI-YEON

68
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,684
[pleasant music playing]

69
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,019
[Jeong-mok] I was surprised.

70
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:08,563
I didn't expect Ji-yeon to come.
Not Ji-yeon.

71
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,860
I didn't really want to see
anyone in particular.

72
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:16,279
I kept thinking to myself,
"Who should I pick?"

73
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:19,699
And since Jeong-mok
was extremely nice and helpful,

74
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:21,784
I was really grateful, so I chose him,

75
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:25,538
thinking it'd be nice
to have some time to talk to him alone.

76
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:29,417
-They were more like friends, right?
-Of course.

77
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,795
Just because it's a date, it doesn't mean
they have to be all lovey-dovey.

78
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,256
-They seem comfortable around each other.
-[Eun-ji] Yeah.

79
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:38,092
Oh, I bought some tangerines.
They're for you.

80
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,594
-To give me? Really?
-I didn't find

81
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:40,845
-Mmm.
-Why?

82
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:42,847
Oh, you know, you didn't get to eat.

83
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,058
You're right, I didn't eat
at all actually. [chuckles]

84
00:03:45,141 --> 00:03:46,559
-Really?
-Yeah.

85
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,937
[breathes deeply]

86
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,730
-I'm only really…
-Yeah?

87
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:52,774
…comfortable around you and Seung-li.

88
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:55,068
-Those close to you?
-Yeah.

89
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:57,946
But since I talked to Seung-li
a lot yesterday,

90
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:59,530
I just… came to you.

91
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:00,615
[chuckles]

92
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:04,244
Out of the women,

93
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,788
I feel at ease with you and Min-hong.

94
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:07,914
Oh. [laughs]

95
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,209
-But the fact that I… that I…
-Yeah.

96
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:13,795
…chose you made me a little worried.

97
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,548
-Why?
-You have enough going on with Min-hong,

98
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:20,260
and you also have a thing with Do too,

99
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:25,014
so I thought, "Is it right for me
to pick you and come here?"

100
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:28,142
-Oh, but that stuff doesn't matter.
-Since we're all so close, you know.

101
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,688
Hmm. Oh, I don't know… anymore.

102
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:38,069
[sighs] I don't know what I should do
at this point. [chuckles]

103
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:40,238
-It's just…
-Hmm.

104
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:41,948
Well, I'm not, like…

105
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:44,867
-Yeah? Yeah.
-…interested in anyone here. [chuckles]

106
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:46,995
-Oh, you're not?
-No.

107
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:49,580
That's so sad.

108
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:51,749
-What? Why?
-It's sad.

109
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:53,042
-Why?
-It's just…

110
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,921
You've mustered up the courage to be here.

111
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,047
[clicks tongue]

112
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:01,467
You're right.

113
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,097
Let's have a drink. How's your hand?

114
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,598
-My hand? Yeah.
-Is it okay?

115
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:09,767
-Doesn't it hurt? It does?
-It does. Yeah.

116
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:11,102
[Han-na] When did she get hurt?

117
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:12,020
THIS MORNING

118
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:14,105
-[Eun-ji] Did something happen?
-[Ji-yeon] Oh, man.

119
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:16,733
[Do] Oh, how will we make the tuna gimbap?

120
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,192
-I cut myself.
-What?

121
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:19,569
-[gasps]
-[Han-na] While cooking?

122
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:22,280
-Hey, wait. Where's the first-aid kit?
-[Do] It's okay, everyone.

123
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:24,449
-Oh, God…
-[Jeong-mok] Hey, you cut your hand?

124
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,117
-[Ji-yeon] What? Yeah.
-Doing what?

125
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,536
-I think the cut is… It's kind of deep.
-Hey.

126
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:30,621
Okay, let's hurry.

127
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,874
-Medical staff… They're not here?
-[Ji-yeon] Looks bad.

128
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:34,500
Please hurry.

129
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:37,337
Oh, Jeong-mok was right by her side
and took care of her.

130
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,254
[In-guk] Mmm.

131
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:40,381
I'm having a bad day today. [chuckles]

132
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:41,966
-This isn't easy.
-I know.

133
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,762
-Seriously…
-Down to hang after the show?

134
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,138
Okay, sounds good.

135
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:49,515
-You should come by my studio.
-I totally will.

136
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:52,101
Actually, uh… I wanted to do music.

137
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,478
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

138
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:54,979
-My parents were against it.
-Right.

139
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,064
"Do it during college."

140
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,148
Mmm.

141
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:00,068
But when I got to college,
I couldn't do it there.

142
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:01,360
Yeah, school is tough.

143
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:04,363
So, when I see people in music,
I feel… jealous.

144
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:06,824
[Han-na] Oh… I guess Jeong-mok
was interested in music.

145
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:10,286
I… I totally understand
because my parents were against it too.

146
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:12,747
-Oh, right.
-I didn't really have hobbies

147
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,457
since I worked part-time. [chuckles]

148
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,125
-Part-time? How old were you?
-What?

149
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:19,003
-I was in ninth grade. Yeah, so…
-You can work in ninth grade?

150
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,963
In the countryside,
you can work as a server

151
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:23,132
-at barbecue places, even if you're young.
-Hmm.

152
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:26,344
So I saved up my money, 150,000 won.

153
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:30,556
From there, I started studying
to retake CSAT.

154
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,016
-You mentioned it.
-But my parents

155
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,976
-were really against that too.
-Mmm.

156
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,480
So, I came to Seoul with a friend
and lived in a tiny room.

157
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:41,025
-You know, the rooms we're in now?
-Mm-hmm.

158
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:42,568
The lower part, when you step down?

159
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,529
-That size, really?
-Well, we fit two people.

160
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:49,450
-You are amazing, seriously.
-That was how I became so self-sufficient.

161
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:53,079
Then I got some work,
and that's… how I ended up here.

162
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:54,956
[mellow music playing]

163
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,501
You'd think Ji-yeon would be timid,
but she actually has a lot of strength.

164
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:01,129
She's the type
who tries to win what she wants.

165
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:02,797
-What's cool about her…
-Yeah.

166
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,341
…is that she doesn't rely
on external help,

167
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:07,802
-but uses her own internal strengths.
-[Han-na] Right.

168
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:10,888
Of course, it might not always work out.

169
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:14,100
-But even when she gets hurt by that, she…
-Yeah, you're right.

170
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:16,477
…bounces back quickly,
and I'm so proud of her.

171
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:17,770
It's so cool to see.

172
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:20,106
[music fades]

173
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:21,649
Why can't they see that?

174
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:22,567
What?

175
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,487
Why can't people see how great you are?

176
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:29,031
[Jeong-mok] Hmm.

177
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,491
-What am I like?
-What?

178
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:31,993
-What am I like?
-Just…

179
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:33,870
It's a shame, you know.

180
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,997
-It's okay.
-It's just… Never mind.

181
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:36,998
-Why?
-So…

182
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:40,168
-"It's just" what? Hurry up and tell me.
-I mean, I might sound like a weirdo.

183
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:41,878
-No, just tell me.
-I mean, just…

184
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:42,962
Seeing you…

185
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,965
How should I say this?

186
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:47,341
If I ever decide

187
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,177
to have a daughter…

188
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,178
[chuckles softly]

189
00:07:51,888 --> 00:07:53,055
If I do…

190
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,640
-Mmm?
-…I wish she'd grow up

191
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:57,059
-to be a person like you.
-Mmm.

192
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:57,977
Me…

193
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,438
-You might not want that.
-Why?

194
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:04,233
You can tell when a girl's…

195
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,151
[clinks]

196
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:07,111
…been raised like a princess.

197
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,197
-You really can.
-You can tell.

198
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,616
-Although, I do envy them a bit.
-Really?

199
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:15,286
"If I ever have a daughter,
I hope she's like you?"

200
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:16,662
Is this guy flirting?

201
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,831
-I don't think that's flirting.
-[Eun-ji] Yeah.

202
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:22,251
Saying that must come
from genuine respect for that person.

203
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,836
-I see, I see.
-[In-guk] Admiration.

204
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,588
Respect as a person.

205
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:27,465
Yeah, so it's not like, "This is flirting,

206
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:31,469
and I want to date you and have a daughter
like you," or anything like that.

207
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:34,680
It's just, "If I love someone
and have a daughter,

208
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:38,184
I hope she loves her work like you,
and I hope she takes after

209
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:41,771
the way you're so confident
in your goals and works hard for them,

210
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:43,439
because I think that's really cool."

211
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,982
But then my heart might skip a beat.

212
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:47,151
-I think so too.
-Women's hearts might skip a beat.

213
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:48,903
It's such a huge compliment to me.

214
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:51,364
-He sees me as great…
-That means… he made the wrong choice.

215
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:52,532
[Eun-ji and Han-na laugh]

216
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,534
-He was wrong.
-Isn't this the best compliment?

217
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:55,535
My heart skips a beat.

218
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:58,371
"I want to have a daughter like you"
is practically like,

219
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:00,122
"I want to kiss you." Wait, why, In-guk?

220
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,207
[Han-na] It's that huge?

221
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,834
Isn't it like saying,
"I want to start a family with you?"

222
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,628
[chuckles] Jeong-mok, you were wrong, kid.

223
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:06,587
[Eun-ji laughs]

224
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,548
-[Car] That's hilarious!
-That's crazy.

225
00:09:11,008 --> 00:09:12,593
[Eun-ji] Someone's coming.

226
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:13,803
Oh, It's Min-hong.

227
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,429
[In-guk] Min-hong…

228
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:17,515
[Min-hong] Actually,
I wasn't all that happy,

229
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:20,768
but since I was only interested
in Jeong-mok anyway,

230
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:22,311
I just ended up picking him.

231
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:25,940
I think I walked into that date
with really high hopes.

232
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:28,818
Min-hong might have a different vibe
when they're one-on-one,

233
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:32,113
-compared to how she usually is. Yeah.
-[Eun-ji] Right? She seems more feminine.

234
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:34,365
[Min-hong] Oh,
I was trying to surprise you.

235
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,243
-[Jeong-mok] You can't be that sneaky.
-Mmm?

236
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:40,621
SECRET DATE
JEONG-MOK & MIN-HONG

237
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:43,291
[mellow music playing]

238
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,168
Cheers.

239
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:48,379
Cheers.

240
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,342
[Min-hong] Mmm.

241
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:55,177
-[glass thuds softly]
-[smacks lips]

242
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,804
-Bitter.
-Is it?

243
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:58,681
Things are just really bitter today.

244
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,516
-Bitter?
-Yeah, today is bitter.

245
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,019
I had a difficult day today.

246
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,103
-Was it?
-Yeah.

247
00:10:04,186 --> 00:10:05,104
In what way?

248
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:07,523
I don't know. Today was just really hard.

249
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,108
But I think it's a bit better now.

250
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:10,693
-Are you okay now?
-Yeah, yeah.

251
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,655
You look nice today.

252
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:18,117
I actually tried to match your outfit.
"I should wear some black today too."

253
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,328
-I thought it'd be cute so I matched you.
-Really?

254
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:21,912
-Trying to match me?
-Yeah.

255
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:24,206
-I brought my glasses too.
-Oh, really? Where?

256
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,791
Wanna see? How do they look?

257
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,627
-[whimsical music playing]
-[chuckles]

258
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:28,753
I look cute.

259
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,630
[both chuckle]

260
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:34,050
-[Car] Ah.
-She matched his style.

261
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,468
It's a similar style.

262
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:38,346
-I picked you and came here.
-Yeah.

263
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:39,430
Thoughts?

264
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:40,681
I'm grateful.

265
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:45,853
[Jeong-mok sighs]

266
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:48,481
-I have a question.
-What's up?

267
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:51,776
So, you talked with Do
a lot yesterday too.

268
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:52,693
Right.

269
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,862
Just based on conversations,

270
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:58,032
who do you think you feel more at ease
and have more fun with?

271
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:00,910
It's obviously me.

272
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,953
-It's… it's obviously you.
-It's so…

273
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:04,288
[smacks lips]

274
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:06,540
-This is hard.
-Right.

275
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,381
[Min-hong] I think Jeong-mok was

276
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:15,800
really going back and forth
between me and Do.

277
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:20,846
What I tried to do was make him
feel at ease while he's with me.

278
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:23,307
I think that's probably my best bet.

279
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,393
[soft contemplative music playing]

280
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:28,938
-So, I'm in college now.
-Mmm.

281
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:32,024
-Do you think it'll be okay…
-Hmm?

282
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:33,776
…to date me?

283
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:37,655
Before I came here,
I would've totally said no.

284
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:38,906
-Right.
-"Why would I?"

285
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:40,741
Like, "I'd rather not."

286
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:44,328
I think I used to be like that,
but I don't feel that way anymore.

287
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:46,914
We can just work hard on our own things

288
00:11:46,997 --> 00:11:49,417
-Right. Mmm.
-…and meet when we can.

289
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:52,294
Why? Is that your biggest concern?

290
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,714
What? Why is Jeong-mok
asking a question like that?

291
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:59,760
I don't think he'd say that unless he was,
like, really interested in her.

292
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,929
Wouldn't you say he's interested?

293
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:03,806
-Oh, is he more into Min-hong?
-Yes.

294
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,225
-I don't think so. No.
-[Han-na] Not at all?

295
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:09,645
But I also don't think Jeong-mok
is that interested in Min-hong now.

296
00:12:09,728 --> 00:12:10,563
[Han-na] Right.

297
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:13,232
"What do you think
it'll be like to date me?"

298
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:14,900
"Well, I'm a student."

299
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:18,988
I think he was kind of drawing
a clear line, like, bam, bam, bam.

300
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,532
-That kind of thing.
-He's explaining why it wouldn't work.

301
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:22,783
-[In-guk] Yes.
-So, I think

302
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,661
this is just an excuse
for turning her down,

303
00:12:25,744 --> 00:12:28,956
how he talks about being
a college student versus having a job.

304
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:32,626
But I'm kind of worried
that Min-hong will take this as

305
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,920
-[Han-na] Mmm.
-…"Maybe not now, but later."

306
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:38,340
Why? Is that you're biggest concern?

307
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:41,260
I, um, can't help but…

308
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,095
-[inhales]
-[solemn music playing]

309
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,513
…think about it. [sighs]

310
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:45,973
-Everyone here…
-Hmm.

311
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:50,227
…that I have met has either a job
or profession, you know?

312
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:54,440
-And I want to date someone I can, like…
-Yeah.

313
00:12:54,523 --> 00:12:55,858
…stay with for a while,

314
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:58,777
have something long-term.

315
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:02,948
So it's important that
I really consider these things.

316
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:06,368
Well, you should consider that,
if it's something important to you.

317
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,662
I was just curious about…

318
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:10,956
what you thought.

319
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:22,009
-[cell phone chimes]
-I think that's you.

320
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:23,177
A MESSAGE HAS ARRIVED

321
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,762
-Hmm?
-Is it over?

322
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:25,930
YOUR DATE HAS ENDED

323
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:26,931
I've gotta go.

324
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,724
Let's have some…

325
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:30,768
soju later on.

326
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:32,228
See you later.

327
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:45,616
HOW WAS YOUR DATE WITH JEONG-MOK?

328
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:46,867
[melancholic music playing]

329
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,161
[Min-hong] My heart just felt heavy.

330
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,955
I knew in my head that…

331
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,291
Jeong-mok would be there,

332
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,626
but in my heart,

333
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,545
I felt like…

334
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:00,256
like nobody was going to show up at all.

335
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:11,600
[sighs]

336
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,647
[emotionally] Oh, just a minute.

337
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:19,817
[sighs]

338
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:24,446
[crying]

339
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:44,967
Oh, I'm sorry.

340
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:48,429
[sniffling]

341
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:51,181
[melancholic music continues]

342
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,850
[Min-hong continues crying]

343
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,733
Well, if I do get a chance tomorrow…

344
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:01,650
LAST NIGHT

345
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,110
…I wanna hang out with you.

346
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:05,529
That's my wish.

347
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:12,828
See, what happened is,

348
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:16,582
all of the guys picked their dates
in the morning, and…

349
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:20,669
and nobody came
even after I waited for a while.

350
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,839
I think that was kind of difficult for me.

351
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:26,508
Not in the sense
of having to wait a while,

352
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:29,929
but just slowly realizing
nobody was coming.

353
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:32,473
From Jeong-mok's perspective,

354
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:36,518
it makes sense he'd choose
to talk to someone he's attracted to.

355
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:40,522
From my own perspective,
if I want to become the leading lady,

356
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:43,859
I could just grab anyone's hand
and leave with them.

357
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:46,362
But I don't want to do that.

358
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,449
The only person
I'm interested in is Jeong-mok,

359
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:53,118
but if that disappears as well,
then what can I do?

360
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,995
I was worried that would happen.

361
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,748
Jeong-mok is not at fault for anything.

362
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,419
I'm just crying because
I'm having a really difficult time.

363
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:04,463
So, yeah…

364
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:07,299
[sighs heavily]

365
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:08,384
[sniffles]

366
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:11,595
Is dating and love
supposed to be this hard?

367
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:15,891
It's really hard.
Like, is this what everybody goes through?

368
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,645
This is kind of hard.
Can you live your life like this?

369
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,064
Can you do your job properly?

370
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,565
In my emotional state,

371
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,484
I don't think I could work well.

372
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,403
[inhales deeply]

373
00:16:28,195 --> 00:16:29,321
[In-guk] Oh, dear.

374
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:32,116
Goodness, I didn't expect
Min-hong to cry like that.

375
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:35,661
-[In-guk] Yeah, my heart just…
-Jeez, what is going on?

376
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:38,580
-It's like everything's falling apart.
-[Han-na and Eun-ji] Yeah.

377
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:43,002
So, she said it like a line
or a sequence from a movie, and I could…

378
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:45,087
-[In-guk] Mmm.
-…understand exactly how she felt.

379
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,463
-[Eun-ji] Yeah.
-[In-guk] Mm-hmm.

380
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,590
It's like she showed us,
"This is who I am,"

381
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,676
-just in that one scene.
-So true.

382
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:51,593
So true.

383
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,637
Min-hong seemed really strong before,

384
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:56,223
but as she started
to develop romantic feelings,

385
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:59,309
she seems to have become more vulnerable.

386
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:02,312
-It just breaks my heart.
-Honestly, that's the worst feeling ever.

387
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:06,316
When there's, like, a person you like,
but then that person likes someone else.

388
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,944
-[Car sighs]
-That's when you feel small and timid,

389
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:11,071
-Yeah, right.
-…and you feel so hopeless.

390
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:13,115
I think that's what she felt.

391
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,241
[Han-na] Mmm.

392
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:16,326
[dreamy music playing]

393
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:26,045
[Seung-li] It would be nice
to have another secret date with Ji-su.

394
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:30,007
[music fades]

395
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:34,053
[mellow groovy music playing]

396
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:36,180
[sighs heavily]

397
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:39,892
I'm not sure
if someone's joining me or not.

398
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:41,685
[bartender] Oh. So, it's just you?

399
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:42,770
I'm not sure.

400
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:45,230
It might be. [chuckles softly]

401
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:46,482
I don't know.

402
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,817
Old Pal is a cocktail, right?

403
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:51,487
-Like "old friend"?
-[bartender] Ah, yes. That's right.

404
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,698
I miss my friend,
so could I have a glass of that?

405
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,658
-[bartender] Yes, right away, sir.
-Thanks.

406
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,744
[mellow groovy music continues]

407
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,457
[Hyun-kyu] I really wanted
to go on a date with Ji-su,

408
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,250
so I was hoping she would come.

409
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,754
-[music fades]
-[insects trilling]

410
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,381
-Okay, who's this now?
-[Eun-ji] Who is it?

411
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:14,218
-Our little gentleman, Mr. Kim Sang-ho.
-[Han-na] Ah.

412
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:16,470
[Sang-ho] I really, really like Ji-su.

413
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:17,638
I like Mi-ji too.

414
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:20,849
Well, it's not like
I'm not interested in her, she's great.

415
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:22,851
It's not like
I'd be bored with someone else.

416
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,395
I just hope that someone likes me too.

417
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,482
[mellow music playing]

418
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,695
[In-guk] I'm so curious.
She can only pick one person.

419
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:34,822
[Car] That's right.

420
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:36,907
[enthralling music builds]

421
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:39,535
[sighs]

422
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,623
[enthralling music continues]

423
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:03,642
[Ji-su] Good evening!

424
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,604
[Han-na] It's not Sang-ho, is it?

425
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:09,940
-Excuse me.
-Oh, right.

426
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:13,485
-[laughs]
-[Han-na] The server.

427
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:16,446
-Did you order food?
-[Han-na] Even before his guest arrives…

428
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,115
-[Car] You actually ordered food!
-Food!

429
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:19,449
Wait, why did he order food?

430
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:22,244
-This is so… What'd he order?
-[Han-na] Usually, when someone comes…

431
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:23,328
Seriously, what'd he get?

432
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:25,455
A seafood… seafood platter.

433
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,666
-A seafood platter?
-[Han-na] I can't believe him.

434
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:28,584
Sure. Whatever, man.

435
00:19:28,667 --> 00:19:30,794
-Order him a bottle of soju too.
-[Car] Might as well.

436
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:34,006
-God. Sang-ho is such a character.
-[Han-na] Sang-ho's so serious about food.

437
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:36,758
-It's cute. Yeah, it's cute.
-He's adorable.

438
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:41,054
[Ji-su] Hello there!

439
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:42,764
Hello there!

440
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,017
-[Car] Oh, she went to Seung-li.
-[In-guk] To Seung-li.

441
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,185
[Eun-ji squeals]

442
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,811
-[Han-na] They met.
-[Eun-ji] Seung-li!

443
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,396
-You… you came?
-[Ji-su] Huh?

444
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:52,024
-Are you drunk today too?
-[chuckles] No, no, no.

445
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:53,108
[upbeat music playing]

446
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,693
Why are you so red?

447
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:56,028
I didn't expect you.

448
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:58,405
-Oh, really?
-Didn't think you'd choose me.

449
00:19:58,488 --> 00:19:59,823
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

450
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:02,075
Why?

451
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:05,162
Well, there's so much…

452
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:06,830
competition for you.

453
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:10,292
-But here you are.
-Yeah. [chuckles]

454
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,376
What a surprise.

455
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,879
-Oh, is it?
-Yeah, it really is.

456
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:16,632
[Eun-ji] Seung-li looks so happy.

457
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,217
"I wonder if Ji-su will come."

458
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:19,676
That's what I thought to myself.

459
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,345
But when Ji-su came

460
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:23,722
through the door and I saw her face…

461
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,100
Hello there!

462
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,644
Wow… I think…

463
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:33,315
I've been the happiest I've been
since I got here. So excited.

464
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,400
[upbeat Korean song playing]

465
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:41,448
[Seung-li] But I actually thought it'd be
awesome if you showed up today.

466
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:43,367
-Yeah.
-I'm so surprised.

467
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,326
Oh, really?

468
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:45,786
Yeah, very surprised.

469
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:48,163
Thank you for that too.

470
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,250
Have you had dinner?

471
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,085
-[Ji-su] No. No.
-[Seung-li] You haven't?

472
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,921
I had a date with you… yesterday.

473
00:20:56,004 --> 00:21:00,008
It was supposed to be
a two-on-two date with you,

474
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,761
but since I kept competing,

475
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:04,638
I… didn't pay attention to you,

476
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:07,933
-and I felt bad about that.
-Mmm.

477
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:09,643
-As long as you're sorry.
-Yeah.

478
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:11,812
Just be careful next time.

479
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:13,981
Well, I was just so nervous.

480
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:16,525
-I just felt shy, so I just kept…
-Mmm.

481
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:19,361
…talking nonsense about,
"Hey, let's compete!"

482
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:20,737
[Ji-su] Mmm.

483
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:22,823
-That was… why I did that.
-It happens.

484
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:26,326
But I think I would've felt the same way

485
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:29,621
if both someone else and I
liked the same person.

486
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,248
-Right?
-Hmm.

487
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:32,958
-[mellow music playing]
-[smacks lips]

488
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:37,713
They're admitting their mistakes
and apologizing quickly.

489
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:40,799
He's saying, "I only said that stuff
because I was shy."

490
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:44,177
At first, you were… [clicks tongue]

491
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:45,887
…there before me.

492
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:48,390
And, like, wow, you just looked…

493
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:52,394
so radiant,
and everything around you was shining,

494
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:53,645
so at first, I thought,

495
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:56,148
"Is there a celebrity here?"

496
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:58,442
So I think the first thing
I said to you was,

497
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:00,235
-"Are you a cast member?"
-Yeah. Right.

498
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:01,862
-Cast member?
-Yeah.

499
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:03,780
-[Seung-li] Oh, I see.
-Yeah.

500
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:06,283
-That was why I asked you that.
-Oh.

501
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:10,996
This is really unexpected. I can't believe
I'm actually on a secret date with you.

502
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:12,414
-Neither can I.
-Yeah.

503
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:15,917
Yeah, it's unbelievable,
and to be very honest, it's an honor.

504
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,169
Oh…

505
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:20,422
-[Ji-su] But there's… that too.
-Okay, yeah.

506
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:23,258
-Someone asked me before I left…
-Yeah.

507
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,426
…for my secret date,

508
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:27,471
"So, who are you finally going to pick?"

509
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:30,307
I said, "I don't know
who I'm going to pick."

510
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:34,269
"I actually have no idea right now.
I'm having a hard time deciding."

511
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:36,146
And then, they suddenly said,

512
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:39,733
"Seung-li was looking out for you so much.
I was surprised."

513
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:40,984
-Really?
-Yeah.

514
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:43,653
"He said he'd take your bag
and bring it to you."

515
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:47,074
I was… really moved by that, actually.

516
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:48,909
THIS MORNING

517
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:50,744
-It's Ji-su's, right?
-I'll bring it to her.

518
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:53,246
[Min-hong] Oh, you should
bring it to her. Go ahead.

519
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,625
-[Han-na] Oh!
-Seung-li, I like the sleeveless shirt!

520
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:57,834
[Han-na] A sleeveless shirt.

521
00:22:57,918 --> 00:22:59,419
[Cupids laughing]

522
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:01,838
-Hey, he even hung it around his neck.
-[Yeo-myung] Coming.

523
00:23:01,922 --> 00:23:03,215
[Seung-li] Is Ji-su here?

524
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:05,092
-Hey!
-[Seung-li] Here's your bag.

525
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:07,177
-Are you okay?
-[Ji-su] Yeah.

526
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,137
You seemed like
you were kind of off yesterday.

527
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,640
-I need energy.
-[Seung-li] Okay, get some rest.

528
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,183
[chuckles] Okay, thank you.

529
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:15,852
He must be really into you.

530
00:23:17,187 --> 00:23:18,855
I think Seung-li is a nice guy.

531
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:23,443
[Ji-su] Seung-li seemed to
keep paying attention to me,

532
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:28,406
but that made me more aware
of Hyun-kyu's interest in me.

533
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,741
[cheerful music playing]

534
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:32,828
[Seung-li] I think my feelings
for Ji-su have gotten stronger

535
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:34,496
since our date.

536
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:36,998
A MESSAGE HAS ARRIVED

537
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,084
-Oh?
-What is it?

538
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:41,586
It says my date is over.
It's shorter than I thought.

539
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:44,172
-Why so short? Felt like five minutes.
-[In-guk laughs]

540
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,215
[Ji-su] I know.

541
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:48,051
-It felt like five seconds to them.
-[Eun-ji] It was too quick.

542
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:50,762
-But I'm really rooting for them.
-[Eun-ji] Me too.

543
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:54,057
Because Ji-su said that
she had a dark side to her personality,

544
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,268
and that she was anxious about things,

545
00:23:56,351 --> 00:24:00,272
-but the… only person who took that in a…
-He made her feel better.

546
00:24:00,355 --> 00:24:03,275
…lighthearted way and made her laugh
while talking about it was Seung-li.

547
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:04,276
[Car] Right, yes.

548
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:08,613
Watching them makes me
look forward to seeing them even more,

549
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:10,866
-and see how they'll overcome this.
-[Car] That's true.

550
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:13,535
Maybe they'll conquer
their struggles in a lighthearted way?

551
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,745
-Yeah, yeah.
-I'm really rooting for them.

552
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:17,873
[cell phone chimes]

553
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:24,171
YOUR DATE HAS ENDED

554
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:25,172
[clicks tongue]

555
00:24:25,255 --> 00:24:27,382
[Eun-ji] Oh, our dear Hyun-kyu.

556
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:29,718
[Han-na] He must have a lot on his mind.

557
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:31,803
[wistful guitar music playing]

558
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,305
[sighs] Oh…

559
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:35,640
-Excuse me, sir.
-Yes.

560
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:37,392
[Hyun-kyu] Nobody's joining me.

561
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:38,810
-Another Godfather, please?
-Sure.

562
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:40,687
This… this is kind of pathetic.

563
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:41,938
[scoffs]

564
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:43,732
-Yeah.
-[bartender] My pleasure.

565
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:53,033
[Hyun-kyu] I knew that
she would pick someone… someone else.

566
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:55,493
I honestly knew that, but I still thought

567
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:58,705
it would've been nice
if she had picked me.

568
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:00,790
[wistful guitar music continues]

569
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:11,635
-[Han-na laughs]
-Is he asleep?

570
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:12,636
[Han-na] Sang-ho!

571
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:14,596
A MESSAGE HAS ARRIVED

572
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:15,722
[sighs]

573
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:16,932
Ugh, I'm tired.

574
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:19,976
YOUR DATE HAS ENDED

575
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:22,062
Why am I so tired?

576
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:23,438
[insects trilling]

577
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:27,442
[melancholic Italian music playing]

578
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:33,240
-Oh, I guess he was still waiting.
-He ordered red-banded lobster.

579
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:34,908
Is there a spicy stew?

580
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:36,910
-[laughs]
-[Han-na laughs]

581
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:38,870
-A bowl of rice too, please.
-Yes, of course.

582
00:25:39,537 --> 00:25:42,123
Oh, my Lord.
When was the last time he ate?

583
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,626
-[In-guk laughs] Seriously though.
-Yeah.

584
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:46,920
[Sang-ho] It was boring
waiting for someone,

585
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:48,713
but when I'm with the others,

586
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,423
I can't eat comfortably like this.

587
00:25:50,507 --> 00:25:52,634
SANG-HO ATE CAREFULLY IN FRONT OF OTHERS

588
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:54,719
[Do] Honestly, it's not that bad.

589
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:57,514
-[Mi-ji] I use that.
-[Sang-ho] Yeah.

590
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:59,891
I thought it would be nice
to eat comfortably,

591
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:02,644
unbothered, and to my heart's content.

592
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:04,896
So it was kind of nice that no one came.

593
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,733
-[Han-na] Oh, wow, he's eating so well.
-[Car] That's it!

594
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:09,859
-[Eun-ji] Nice!
-Thank you.

595
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:10,777
-Wow!
-Anything else?

596
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,822
-[Sang-ho] No, that's it. Thank you.
-I think his diet is over.

597
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:15,532
-[Han-na] I know.
-It's over now.

598
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:21,579
-[Car] That's it. Go, go, go!
-[Eun-ji] Wow!

599
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:24,457
-[Car] You have to keep going.
-[Han-na] Oh, you're hungry!

600
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:26,293
[slurping]

601
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:29,129
WERE YOU… REALLY HUNGRY BY ANY CHANCE?

602
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:32,507
I wanted to critique the food,
kind of like fine dining?

603
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:34,217
So I tried eating excitedly.

604
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:37,178
-[peppy amusing music playing]
-[slurping and chomping]

605
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:38,179
[Eun-ji] Oh.

606
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:39,806
-[In-guk] There you go!
-[Eun-ji] Wow.

607
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:42,517
-Nice.
-[Car] Hey, he made a nice wrap.

608
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,769
I think he finds it humorous too!

609
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:47,272
-You just saw his face, right?
-Right, right.

610
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:49,607
-Yeah, yeah.
-As he was making the wrap himself…

611
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:51,401
Yeah, I'm sure
he thought it was funny too.

612
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:54,321
He is the best participant
I've seen on a dating show.

613
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:56,823
-The best.
-[Eun-ji] He's the best.

614
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:02,120
[music ends]

615
00:27:04,706 --> 00:27:06,041
[inhales deeply]

616
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,294
[moody music playing]

617
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:12,964
-Hey!
-[Car] How manly is that? Nice!

618
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:14,632
[Cupids laughing]

619
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:16,801
-[Han-na] He put it over his shoulder.
-[Eun-ji] Wow.

620
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,595
-Nice.
-[Han-na] You're so cool, Sang-ho.

621
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:21,473
Sang-ho, you are…

622
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:24,184
representing so many other men. [laughs]

623
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:25,477
[Han-na] Seriously, wow.

624
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,437
-Wow, so cool.
-[Car] Nice, nice, Sang-ho.

625
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,565
-[Han-na] That was so cool.
-This is over. You're cool, and that's it.

626
00:27:30,648 --> 00:27:31,566
Done, done.

627
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:33,610
That's an actual,
real movie scene right there.

628
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:34,903
-[Eun-ji] So true.
-Yeah.

629
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:37,405
-[mellow music playing]
-[woman sighs]

630
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:38,990
[exhales]

631
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:40,116
[In-guk] Is it Yeo-myung?

632
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,288
LAST NIGHT

633
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:46,289
Tomorrow,

634
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:49,542
I don't think
I can go on a date with Jeong-mok

635
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:52,253
because my heart aches,

636
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:56,383
and I want to avoid
the awkwardness of seeing him.

637
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:59,344
Yeah, she could feel that way for now.

638
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:02,430
Oh, but Jae-yun expressed
how he felt for her.

639
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:05,100
-Oh, right, right.
-I hope she'll give him a chance tonight.

640
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:08,019
Oh, please go see Jae-yun this once.

641
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:11,648
[Jae-yun] I want to see
Yeo-myung soon and talk to her.

642
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:13,858
I hope we can change the mood between us

643
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:16,403
to something more romantic.

644
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:19,030
[mellow music continues]

645
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:20,657
[sighs]

646
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:22,700
[breathes heavily]

647
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,413
[Yeo-myung] When I got to the date spot…

648
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:28,248
[chuckles] …I couldn't
go through the door.

649
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:31,167
I was standing outside,
but my hands were shaking.

650
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:36,464
[chuckling] Hi.

651
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,260
[chuckles]

652
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:42,804
[chuckles]

653
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:43,930
Hi.

654
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:45,557
JEONG-MOK & YEO-MYUNG

655
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,892
-Oh, she went to Jeong-mok.
-You came.

656
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,478
-You wait long?
-Please, sit. Nope.

657
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:52,355
What's this?

658
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:54,941
What were you drinking?

659
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,402
I was… sipping some wine,

660
00:28:57,485 --> 00:28:58,695
so I'm buzzed.

661
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:00,238
[laughs]

662
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,032
Did you know I would come?

663
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:05,535
-Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
-Did you expect I'd come?

664
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:07,162
[chuckling]

665
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:13,334
Oh, talking like this makes me nervous.

666
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:14,252
[chuckles]

667
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:15,628
[soft music playing]

668
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:16,755
Really?

669
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:18,590
Yeah.

670
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:22,802
The only time
I was directly rejected was yesterday.

671
00:29:22,886 --> 00:29:26,473
I felt pretty bummed out
and lost a lot of confidence.

672
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:27,849
But to be honest,

673
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:30,351
this feels… refreshing.

674
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:33,730
In a strange way, I feel way more relaxed
and not as pressured.

675
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:37,233
Before, I was really careful
about talking to Jeong-mok

676
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:39,235
and couldn't approach him,

677
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,904
but I honestly thought,

678
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:42,655
"He already knows I like him,

679
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:45,492
so I could just
do what my heart tells me to."

680
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:47,702
So that was why I picked Jeong-mok.

681
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:50,163
[giggles]

682
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:53,458
I really had a lot I wanted to say to you…

683
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:56,669
but now that I'm here to talk…

684
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:57,837
-Can't remember?
-It's like…

685
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:59,964
Yeah, my mind is drawing a blank.

686
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:03,843
[music fades]

687
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:05,762
Oh. That's right.

688
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:08,848
-You said you read Do's diary…
-Yeah.

689
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:11,392
-…in the 5 Minute Library.
-Mmm.

690
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,186
If you ever get to go there again…

691
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:15,313
-Uh-huh.
-… you should read mine too.

692
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,440
-Okay? [chuckles]
-Okay.

693
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:19,859
-You should read mine. It's really fun.
-It's fun?

694
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:21,277
-I worked hard on that.
-Really?

695
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:23,655
I don't even remember
what I wrote in mine.

696
00:30:23,738 --> 00:30:24,697
What you wrote?

697
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:26,658
I just remembered
what I wanted to remember.

698
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:27,659
-Really?
-Yeah.

699
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:29,410
-Oh, from my diary?
-Yeah.

700
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:31,704
Anything in particular you remember?

701
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:34,958
Like, for example,
if there's a girl you're interested in…

702
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:36,793
-Right.
-…do you sit next to her

703
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:37,877
or across from her?

704
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:39,087
That kind of thing.

705
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:41,840
-I think I'd sit across from her.
-Really?

706
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:44,133
You fool.

707
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:47,470
-You said you'd sit next to her. Yeah.
-Did it change? Really?

708
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:49,639
[Yeo-myung laughing]

709
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:54,519
Anyway, my childhood photo
is really very cute, so take a look.

710
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:56,604
-Really cute.
-You're still cute.

711
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,064
-[squeals]
-[Han-na laughs]

712
00:30:58,147 --> 00:31:00,859
-[Car] Oh, that's something…
-Yeah, Yeo-myung is so adorable.

713
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:02,819
That's something really handsome guys do.

714
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:04,279
-[laughs]
-[Car] Of course.

715
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:06,614
[Eun-ji] Yeah,
that's something that In-guk or--

716
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:08,032
Things guys like In-guk would do!

717
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,659
-[Eun-ji] Right.
-This is so hilarious,

718
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:11,202
it's driving me crazy, seriously.

719
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:12,412
You're not there yet, okay?

720
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:14,289
-Just… take it easy.
-[Eun-ji] He's quick.

721
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:16,249
[amusing music playing]

722
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:17,500
[Yeo-myung laughs]

723
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:18,668
Is something funny, or…

724
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:20,545
-No, I'm sorry. I won't laugh.
-[chuckles]

725
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:22,422
Okay.

726
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,173
So, yeah.

727
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:26,885
[music ends]

728
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:28,761
-Anyway, I thought a lot…
-Mm-hmm.

729
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:30,513
…about what you said to me.

730
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:31,556
Okay.

731
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:33,224
Mmm…

732
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:35,059
So you said to me…

733
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,061
-Mmm.
-[Yeo-myung chuckles]

734
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:40,857
-That it was easy to go from one to five…
-Yeah. Yeah.

735
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:43,276
…but it was hard to go
from zero to one, right?

736
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,946
-Yes, well, should I take that back?
-Yes.

737
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:47,864
So, yeah.

738
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:50,617
LAST NIGHT

739
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,702
[gentle solemn music playing]

740
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:54,412
You're it… for me.

741
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:58,249
I mean, I'm so thankful
that you're interested in me.

742
00:31:58,333 --> 00:31:59,167
Mmm.

743
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:01,210
But feelings can go

744
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:03,504
-from one to five to ten.
-Mmm.

745
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:07,216
But can they go from zero to one?

746
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,093
[Yeo-myung] Mmm.

747
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:10,762
-So does this mean I'm a zero?
-I think…

748
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:13,973
-Oh, that's not what I meant. I just…
-Okay.

749
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:15,391
I'm zero?

750
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:17,018
Point five?

751
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:18,436
[chuckles]

752
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:21,356
You're not a zero. You're not.

753
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:23,608
-[chuckles]
-Not a zero.

754
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:26,903
-What you said really hit me…
-Yeah. Yeah.

755
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:29,948
…on a deep level that I wasn't expecting.

756
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:33,701
-But you said I was…
-Mmm.

757
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,828
…a 0.5 to you.

758
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:37,997
I was about a 0.5.

759
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:39,123
Mmm.

760
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:41,167
So, I thought,

761
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:42,877
"If I gain…

762
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:46,339
[breath shaking] …0.1 each day,

763
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:48,967
maybe I could become a one." [laughs]

764
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:52,428
"Maybe I could become a one." [laughs]

765
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:54,889
I've been thinking about that all day.

766
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:56,933
[gasps]

767
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:58,059
-Ah.
-[Han-na] Ah.

768
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:59,936
[Eun-ji] Oh, my goodness.

769
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:01,521
This is totally a drama.

770
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:02,480
[Eun-ji exclaims]

771
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:05,775
If I were Jeong-mok, I wouldn't be able
to handle all of this flirting.

772
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:08,861
-His heart might be swayed a bit.
-I think his heart skipped a beat.

773
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:10,029
[mellow music playing]

774
00:33:10,113 --> 00:33:11,447
[Yeo-myung chuckling]

775
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:13,116
You're someone's daughter, and…

776
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:14,826
[laughs]

777
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:17,036
This obsession with daughters!

778
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,371
[Han-na and In-guk laugh]

779
00:33:18,454 --> 00:33:22,083
-He must really want to have a daughter.
-God, this is making my blood boil again.

780
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:23,710
[Han-na] "Obsessed with daughters."

781
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:26,754
[Yeo-myung] Well, anyway,
what I wanted to say was…

782
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:32,510
[chuckles] you're my top choice
out of all the guys here.

783
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:34,929
-So I just…
-Yeah.

784
00:33:35,805 --> 00:33:37,932
So don't feel pressured,

785
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,643
-and just hang out with me…
-Okay.

786
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:42,895
…when I… come to you.

787
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:45,273
-[chuckles softly]
-Okay? [chuckles]

788
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:48,735
-Okay.
-Get what I mean? [chuckles]

789
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:51,821
I just wanted to tell you that.

790
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:55,700
[glass thuds]

791
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:58,786
Any thoughts?

792
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,955
-Why aren't you answering me?
-No, I said, "Okay."

793
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,707
[chuckling]

794
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:05,543
[Yeo-myung] Whenever I talk to Jeong-mok,

795
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:09,047
I just have fun, no matter what he says.

796
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:13,885
I think I was attracted to him
because I kept finding him charming.

797
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:16,763
Now, I'm going to keep…

798
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,223
trying to get closer to him.

799
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:23,519

-[In-guk] Jae-yun is…

The time for his date is up.

[enchanting music playing]

804
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,412
[Han-na] The person
Jeong-mok was waiting for.

805
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:42,622
[Eun-ji] It's Do.

806
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:47,502
-How many…
-Mmm.

807
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:49,504
…dates do you think you'll have today?

808
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:50,421
Take a guess.

809
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,381
I just want one.

810
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:54,258
-Oh…
-Why's that?

811
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:00,181
[Do] I did some self-reflection
after my date during the day.

812
00:35:00,973 --> 00:35:05,686
I thought, "I should express my feelings
more clearly too."

813
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,980
And I promised myself,

814
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:09,524
"Let's go."

815
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:11,442

[Jeong-mok] You tired?

823

Yeah, it's pretty late now.

824
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:40,096
I know.

825
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:41,305
You must've been busy.

826
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:43,307
Nah, nah, it wasn't that bad.

828
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:46,477
Have you not eaten? Not at all?

829
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:47,937
-I have.
-What did you eat?

830
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:48,896
A bread roll.

831
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,106
-A bread roll?
-This.

832
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:51,649
-Just the bread?
-Yeah.

833
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,901
Oh, with something…

834
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:55,528
Hang on.

835
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:58,197
-Oh, I don't want to drink.
-What? Oh, okay.

00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,448
[chuckles softly]

837
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:01,742
I wanted to look…

838
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:04,370
really pretty today.

839
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:06,164
-You do.
-Yeah?

[chuckles]

841
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:12,295
Yeah, so if I ate a proper meal,
my look would be ruined…

00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:15,339
-Oh.
-…so I had something small to eat.

843
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:17,008
[charming music playing]

844
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:18,050
[chuckles softly]

845
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,553
So, since you said

846
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:23,014
-I looked good with my hair down…
-Mmm.

847
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:24,515
-…I kept it like this.
-Really?

848
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:25,474
Yeah.

849
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:26,893
I like your hair up too.

850
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:28,936
-They're both really pretty.
-Really?

851
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,021
[chuckles softly]

852
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:33,441
Anyway… Mmm.

853
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:36,777
It's my way of making an effort.

854
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:40,489
-Hmm. I decided something…
-Mm.

855
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:42,325
-…over the past few days.
-Mm-hmm.

856
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,410
[Do] Mmm.

857
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:47,580
We have three days left,
not counting today.

858
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,458
So… I wanted to…

859
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:54,253
better myself in some way.

860
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:56,130
[soft enchanting music playing]

861
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:59,717
I thought, "I should put in more effort."

862
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:01,302
So I did.

863
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:05,890
We'll both be… busy back in Seoul.

864
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:08,976
[chuckling] Not me. You'll be busy.

865
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:09,894
[both chuckle]

866
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:12,521
-You'll be busy. Midterms, assignments…
-I have plenty of time.

867
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:15,233
-Right. I don't think I'd be as busy…
-…and those kinds of things.

868
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:16,984
…as you even during midterms.

869
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,653
[chuckles] Yeah.

870
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:20,279
I could become

871
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,406
your actual boyfriend.

872
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:24,951
Have you thought about it?

873
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:27,745
[mellow music playing]

874
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:30,039
Has it been too short?
It wasn't much time.

875
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:32,625
Earlier,

876
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,169
-during the day.
-Mm-hmm.

877
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:38,089
We… talked about our dream dates

878
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:39,257
-and stuff.
-Yeah.

879
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:42,760
I think I imagined it a little bit

880
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:44,553
back then, yeah.

881
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:45,930
-You did?
-Mmm.

882
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:47,181
They're all set.

883
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,016
-It's over.
-[Han-na] They're a couple.

884
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,352
-[swooningly] Oh… Mmm.
-[Eun-ji] Oh.

885
00:37:51,978 --> 00:37:53,980
What do you think of us dating?

886
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:55,815
You think it would work?

887
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:58,985
I thought you'd be very sweet.

888
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:00,820
[Jeong-mok] Mmm.

889
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:06,450
When we talked about ideal types…

890
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:07,368
Yeah.

891
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:11,163
Was it our… upbringings?

892
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:12,373
Oh… yeah.

893
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,208
-You mentioned that.
-Yeah.

894
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:17,169
You know what my ideal type would be?

895
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:18,212
Oh.

896
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:22,550
[Do] I want to date someone
who had a similar upbringing to mine,

897
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:26,971
and studies diligently,
like a good honor student would.

898
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:28,764
[upbeat music playing]

899
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:34,103
Can you… tell me what you mean by that,

900
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:36,188
-exactly?
-Oh.

901
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:39,984
I'm sure if someone
had a similar upbringing,

902
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:42,236
-they would've turned out like me.
-Similar…

903
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,154
Similarly?

904
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:45,740
What about your childhood?

905
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:46,657
I grew up

906
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:50,202
with parents
who wanted me to be very studious.

907
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:51,287
-Really?
-Yes.

908
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:53,414
But I didn't study that hard.

909
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:54,540
[both chuckle]

910
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:59,295
And… my mom really liked
technical high schools.

911
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:00,212
Oh, really?

912
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:02,298
-My sister did-- Art school.
-Science or art?

913
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:04,342
-Art school?
-I went to a foreign language school,

914
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:05,926
-and my brother…
-Science school?

915
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,261
-Yeah.
-Oh, which one?

916
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,763
Seoul Science High School.

917
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:12,141
-Oh, and--
-That… That's impressive.

918
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:14,268
-That's like a school for gifted kids.
-Yeah, it is.

919
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:18,064
Why are you asking?

920
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:22,485
Just hearing about… your… life,

921
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:25,154
and, like, how you grew up and stuff,

922
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:26,697
and I just thought…

923
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:28,115
My life was a bit…

924
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,827
-Was it different?
-I thought it sounded a little different,

925
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:32,995
to be honest.

926
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:34,747
As for me…

927
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:38,667
I just… grew up in a normal family

928
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,087
-without much pressure.
-Hmm.

929
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,964
Actually, my parents
didn't ever push me to study.

930
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:45,758
[mellow music playing]

931
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:47,093
I just lived like that.

932
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:51,931
I asked because I was curious
what you meant by upbringing

933
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:55,851
and if you meant,
"Someone who had a… similar life as me."

934
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:04,068
My attraction to Do
was pretty much the same, but…

935
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:05,528
Hmm.

936
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:06,946
It's hard to

937
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:11,450
explain in, like, exact detail

938
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:13,285
since it's just a feeling I have.

939
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:18,207
But I got the sense that
I don't feel comfortable talking to her.

940
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:24,255
I feel like we're not exactly
on the same… wavelength.

941
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:27,007
I want to go to New York this winter…

942
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:28,801
-[Yeo-myung] Okay.
-…for Christmas.

943
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,220
-It must be so fun to ice skate…
-New York?

944
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:33,055
…underneath the Christmas tree.

945
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,061
Before I started working,
I really liked to host parties.

946
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:40,521
Parties? Oh.

947
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:42,356
-Parties.
-You hosted parties?

948
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,399
Yeah.

949
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,945
-Can I ask you what you…
-Yeah.

950
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:50,072
…value the most in this life?

951
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:52,616
My family.

952
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,410
-Hmm.
-You?

953
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:58,372
For me, I value myself… the most.

954
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,291
And my family comes second.

955
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:02,710
[Eun-ji] Oh,
their conversation keeps clashing.

956
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:07,590
I personally think
that she's someone who has really…

957
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:11,093
lived a different life
when compared to mine.

958
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:13,679
I still feel kind of confused.

959
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,600
Actually, that could be a lot of pressure

960
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:19,435
-from Jeong-mok's perspective.
-[Car] Right.

961
00:41:19,518 --> 00:41:23,939
[In-guk] Really,
because from another person's perspective,

962
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:27,109
Do's ideal type
is a specific type of person.

963
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:28,611
-Know what I mean?
-[Eun-ji] True.

964
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:32,990
I think he's probably thinking,
"Would I be able to step into the role…

965
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:34,867
-Mmm.
-…and really fill those shoes?"

966
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,368
Right, right.

967
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:40,247
It's not that Do is bad,
but everyone has their own firm standards.

968
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:41,874
-A set of criteria.
-[Car] Mmm.

969
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:45,002
So, I'm sure that's why
she wants a boyfriend like that too.

970
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:46,128
-Mmm.
-[Han-na] Yeah.

971
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:52,343
Actually, I came here to meet someone

972
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:54,094
I will…

973
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:57,515
have a serious,
long-term relationship with.

974
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:58,891
[Do] Mmm.

975
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:01,852
Anyway, so…

976
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,232
The mood's really shifted.

977
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:07,149
So?

978
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:08,234
[chuckles softly]

979
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:14,490
-You think you can find someone?
-I just…

980
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:17,034
I should find someone.

981
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:20,704
So, I think I have
a lot of things to really think about.

982
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:21,872
[Do] Mmm.

983
00:42:23,082 --> 00:42:23,916
So, like,

984
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,668
-compared to yesterday…
-Yeah.

985
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:27,169
…have you changed your mind?

986
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:28,796
[Jeong-mok] Hmm…

987
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:33,384
[clicks tongue] Some stuff has changed,
and some stuff hasn't. But…

988
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:35,344
[pensive music playing]

989
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:38,931
But I had a date with you…
earlier in the day,

990
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:41,183
and as I'm talking to you now…

991
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:42,726
-Yeah.
-Mmm.

992
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:47,982
You're the one
I'm most attracted to romantically.

993
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:49,900
[Do] Mmm.

994
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:55,114
-But?
-But I… Mmm.

995
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:57,616
I think that when we talk,

996
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:01,120
we're not… exactly on the same wavelength.

997
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:03,080
-Mmm.
-That's…

998
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:05,291
what I felt.

999
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:06,208
[Do] Mmm.

1000
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:10,713
[chuckles drily]

1001
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:16,093
So, I thought to myself,
"Am I just nervous…

1002
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:17,177
Yeah.

1003
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:19,888
…because I'm attracted
to her romantically?"

1004
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:21,765
But we might not…

1005
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:24,602
be on the same wavelength.

1006
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:27,104
I see.

1007
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:30,399
I haven't dated before,

1008
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:36,614
so I'm not really sure
if I should date someone… I'm attracted to

1009
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:41,910
or someone I feel at ease with,
and can easily have conversations with.

1010
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:43,329
[Do] Hmm.

1011
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:46,248
I'm… not too sure about that stuff,

1012
00:43:46,332 --> 00:43:48,375
so it's… kind of…

1013
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:51,420
difficult.

1014
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:54,798
Thanks for telling me.

1015
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:56,467
[music fades]

1016
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:58,761
I mean, he's never done this before.

1017
00:43:58,844 --> 00:44:00,888
We kept talking about this.

1018
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:03,766
"Why hasn't someone
like Jeong-mok been able to date?"

1019
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:06,769
But I think he must've had experiences

1020
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:09,730
where he always hesitated
in these moments.

1021
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:11,273
-I think you're right.
-[Car] Yeah.

1022
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:13,817
-And that makes him even more cautious.
-[Eun-ji] I think so.

1023
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:16,987
He already has a lot on his mind
since he wants a long-term relationship.

1024
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:18,739
He's thinking very seriously about this.

1025
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:21,492
In that aspect,
I think that Jeong-mok also

1026
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:25,079
-has a clear standard in mind too.
-[Han-na] Yeah, right, right.

1027
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:27,748
-They're both the same. The same, yeah.
-[Han-na] What do we do?

1028
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:30,042
They were so close to becoming a couple.

1029
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:32,378
Am I being too honest?

1030
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:33,712
It's okay.

1031
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:37,216
[chuckles softly]

1032
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:39,134
[pensive music playing]

1033
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:42,304
[Do] It wasn't the kind of vibe
I had hoped for.

1034
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:46,975
What exactly does Jeong-mok want to say?

1035
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:48,268
He kept saying,

1036
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:53,190
"You're the one that
I'm the most attracted to romantically,"

1037
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:55,067
but he also said

1038
00:44:55,609 --> 00:44:59,321
that he was looking for a serious,
long-term relationship,

1039
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:03,659
and that we didn't seem
to be on the same wavelength.

1040
00:45:04,284 --> 00:45:06,203
I was… just like…

1041
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:09,039
"What on earth does that mean?"

1042
00:45:09,623 --> 00:45:13,460
But I was afraid to ask,
"And what does that mean?"

1043
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:17,172
Because I thought
that maybe he would tell me,

1044
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:19,383
"Yeah, no, you should just leave."

1045
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:22,761
Mmm.

1046
00:45:22,845 --> 00:45:23,929
Well, actually,

1047
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:29,143
after saying it, I instantly realized
I messed up and regretted it.

1048
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:33,063
I don't think I… should've said so much.

1049
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:35,274
I was just trying to be sincere.

1050
00:45:35,357 --> 00:45:36,483
[clicks tongue]

1051
00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:39,486
What do I… I just…

1052
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:40,779
[sighs] I don't know.

1053
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:44,032
My head's about to burst.

1054
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:47,536
[sighs] Well…

1055
00:45:50,247 --> 00:45:51,081
[music fades]

1056
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:53,375
-[Do] Hmm.
-[cell phone chimes]

1057
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:54,835
A MESSAGE HAS ARRIVED

1058
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:57,379
-[Han-na groans]
-[Eun-ji] You can't leave it at that.

1059
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:58,338
Was that mine?

1060
00:45:58,422 --> 00:45:59,756
-It's mine,
-Is it yours? Oh.

1061
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:02,050
But I can look later?

1062
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:03,385
Okay, just…

1063
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:06,138
About a minute?

1064
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:08,474
-[In-guk] Time's up.
-[Han-na] She can't leave like this.

1065
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:11,143
-[Do chuckles softly]
-[melancholic music playing]

1066
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:12,853
[chuckles softly]

1067
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:15,856
[Do] Hmm.

1068
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:18,650
Hmm.

1069
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:23,572
[chuckles softly]

1070
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:25,365
-I should go, right?
-Huh?

1071
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:26,909
[breathes deeply]

1072
00:46:28,243 --> 00:46:29,912
Bye. Hmm.

1073
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:33,540
Get back safe. See you later.

1074
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:34,625
-Okay.
-Okay?

1075
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:39,379
Hmm.

1076
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:42,341
[sighing] Oh.

1077
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:53,018
Yeah, this feels kind of awkward.

1078
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:55,062
-It's awkward. I don't like this.
-[Car] Ugh…

1079
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:56,688
But Do doesn't understand this at all.

1080
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:59,274
And I bet Do is thinking,
"What's changed all of a sudden?"

1081
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:02,528
Right, right. I mean,
I get that Jeong-mok joined the show

1082
00:47:02,611 --> 00:47:05,155
to meet someone
for a long-term relationship.

1083
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:06,823
It would've been nice

1084
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:08,700
-if he was more specific.
-Yes, right.

1085
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:10,702
-Very true.
-But to say that,

1086
00:47:10,786 --> 00:47:12,704
he'd have to talk about Do as well.

1087
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:16,708
He'd have to talk as if
he's comparing their families and such.

1088
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:19,336
-For someone with Jeong-mok's personality…
-Right, right, right.

1089
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:20,671
…the more specific he gets,

1090
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:24,591
the more he'd feel like
he's attacking the other person.

1091
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:25,842
Not very considerate.

1092
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:28,262
But when we look back
on our first relationships,

1093
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:31,056
we didn't really think much
about background or anything.

1094
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:34,184
We mostly just dated
based on romantic attraction.

1095
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:36,603
-Our cast might be overthinking things.
-Yeah.

1096
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:38,397
Jeong-mok seems to be like that too.

1097
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,857
There's no doubt
Jeong-mok's a little further ahead.

1098
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:43,443
-Yeah. He's quite preoccupied with this.
-He's thinking deeply.

1099
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:44,736
He's dealing with a lot.

1100
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:46,029
-You're right.
-[Eun-ji] Right.

1101
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:47,573
[insects trilling]

1102
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:53,453
I don't think she saw it.

1103
00:47:57,124 --> 00:48:00,127
KANG JI-SU
KIM YEO-MYUNG

1104
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:01,211
ONE HOUR EARLIER

1105
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:03,297
[Hyun-kyu] No one was in my room,

1106
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:06,091
so I wrote a letter and then I…

1107
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:09,136
put it in her mailbox right away.

1108
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:10,554
[suspenseful music playing]

1109
00:48:10,637 --> 00:48:12,306
Who is he writing a letter to?

1110
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:14,558
I think it might be to Ji-su.

1111
00:48:14,641 --> 00:48:16,268
[Hyun-kyu] She hasn't even touched it.

1112
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:26,695
Even after 30 minutes,

1113
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:28,530
the mailbox was still untouched.

1114
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:35,746
I was just pacing back and forth

1115
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:38,206
until I got frustrated.

1116
00:48:38,915 --> 00:48:40,917
[mellow gripping music playing]

1117
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:43,754
[shivering]

1118
00:48:45,547 --> 00:48:48,216
-Oh, no, no, no!
-[Car] No, boy, you're too late.

1119
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:49,926
Ugh, seriously?

1120
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:56,683
[shivering]

1121
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:58,685
[knocking]

1122
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:06,068
[Hyun-kyu] I tried calling her,
but there was no answer. No response.

1123
00:49:06,151 --> 00:49:07,736
[shivering]

1124
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:10,489
Isn't she back yet?

1125
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:13,075
Didn't she come back?

1126
00:49:14,576 --> 00:49:16,411
[Han-na] He has gotten
pretty antsy, for sure.

1127
00:49:16,953 --> 00:49:19,289
[Hyun-kyu] Actually,
I feel really anxious,

1128
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:20,832
and confused and stuff.

1129
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:26,171
I hadn't realized
I was such an emotional person.

1130
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:31,134
I feel like I've had this knot
right here for a few days now.

1131
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:32,969
It's hard. It's really hard.

1132
00:49:33,887 --> 00:49:35,972
I'm so exhausted emotionally.

1133
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:36,973
I didn't think

1134
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:38,642
I'd be this way,

1135
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:41,103
but I've had this knot
right here for days.

1136
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:43,355
It's hard. Really hard.

1137
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:48,110
I didn't realize I was the kind of person
who'd keep needing reassurance.

1138
00:49:48,193 --> 00:49:49,027
But I feel…

1139
00:49:49,569 --> 00:49:51,446
anxious again whenever we're apart.

1140
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:54,199
I want to be with her right now.

1141
00:49:54,282 --> 00:49:57,077
KANG JI-SU
KIM YEO-MYUNG

1142
00:49:57,160 --> 00:49:59,246
That's exactly what love is, kids.

1143
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:01,998
-No one said it was easy.
-[Han-na] Yeah.

1144
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:04,376
[Min-hong] When will they get back?
We have to taste that.

1145
00:50:04,459 --> 00:50:05,794
[Ji-yeon] Let's open the sashimi.

1146
00:50:05,877 --> 00:50:08,672
-[Min-hong] Here's to your dazzling eyes.
-[women] Cheers!

1147
00:50:08,755 --> 00:50:10,799
-Do you want a drink? Hurry.
-Come here.

1148
00:50:10,882 --> 00:50:11,758
All right. Cheers.

1149
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:12,676
[all] Cheers!

1150
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:14,553
It's past midnight now.
Okay, let's do this.

1151
00:50:14,636 --> 00:50:16,221
-Let's do it.
-Let's do it.

1152
00:50:16,304 --> 00:50:19,141
Let's have a healthy,
I mean, happy tomorrow.

1153
00:50:19,224 --> 00:50:21,601
-Why are you mentioning health?
-He spat it out.

1154
00:50:22,185 --> 00:50:24,563
-Hey, what are you doing?
-I mean… Oh, it's not that… Sorry.

1155
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:25,981
[Min-hong and Ji-yeon laugh]

1156
00:50:26,064 --> 00:50:29,317
I wanted to say this.
Do looks like Lisa from BLACKPINK.

1157
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:31,903
-I've been saying that too.
-I thought the same thing.

1158
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:33,321
From The Simpsons?

1159
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:34,448
-What?
-Oh, sorry.

1160
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:36,324
-Who's Lisa from The Simpsons?
-Nothing.

1161
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:37,576
-What was that?
-Just kidding.

1162
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:39,327
-You got the wrong Lisa!
-It was a joke.

1163
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:40,495
But no idea what it means.

1164
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:42,539
-[Ji-yeon] More soju.
-I suck at being funny.

1165
00:50:42,622 --> 00:50:43,832
Yes, you do.

1166
00:50:43,915 --> 00:50:44,958
[laughs]

1167
00:50:45,041 --> 00:50:47,169
He does have an oddly funny side.
He can be funny.

1168
00:50:47,252 --> 00:50:48,754
[Sang-ho] It's kind of addicting.

1169
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:51,006
-But I can't tell if he's joking or not.
-That's true.

1170
00:50:51,089 --> 00:50:52,716
I… I haven't gotten any of his jokes.

1171
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:55,218
-"What did you say?"
-He's actually really funny sometimes.

1172
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:57,220
Oh, but do you want me to give you a tip?

1173
00:50:57,304 --> 00:50:59,681
If you want it to be a joke,
you don't say,

1174
00:50:59,765 --> 00:51:01,391
"Oh, nothing," after you say it.

1175
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:03,643
-[Ji-yeon] A joke. Like, a joke.
-Go like, "Nothing,"

1176
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:06,563
-as you ogle at the other person.
-[Ji-yeon] Yeah, like, "Oh, nothing."

1177
00:51:06,646 --> 00:51:07,939
It makes it okay.

1178
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:09,357
Oh, like that! Yes, right!

1179
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:10,776
It makes it okay.

1180
00:51:10,859 --> 00:51:13,695
-Oh, like that! Yes, right!
-God, that was so annoying!

1181
00:51:13,779 --> 00:51:15,280
-Your face was annoying!
-Like this.

1182
00:51:15,363 --> 00:51:16,615
Hey, I'm kind of proud.

1183
00:51:16,698 --> 00:51:18,533
I've never even seen him like that.

1184
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:21,077
-You're pretty good.
-I'll go like this from now on.

1185
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:24,247
[Ji-yeon] So annoying. Totally annoying.
What's with your expression?

1186
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:26,666
-He's getting shy.
-You're good, now that I've taught you.

1187
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:29,044
Are you the same here and at home?

1188
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:30,462
No, I'm not like this.

1189
00:51:30,545 --> 00:51:32,506
-[Sang-ho] Oh, really?
-I'm really, really quiet.

1190
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:34,716
[quirky music playing]

1191
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,218
-At home?
-You're quiet here too.

1192
00:51:36,301 --> 00:51:37,761
-Even quieter at home?
-Impossible.

1193
00:51:37,844 --> 00:51:39,221
You're quiet here too.

1194
00:51:39,304 --> 00:51:41,640
-[Hyun-kyu] Even quieter at home?
-I'm quiet here too.

1195
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:43,475
No, but you've gotten much better

1196
00:51:43,558 --> 00:51:44,810
-since the first day.
-Oh.

1197
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:47,437
On the first day,
I thought you couldn't speak at all.

1198
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:48,438
[laughter]

1199
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:51,817
-[Hyun-kyu] I thought the same thing.
-[Seung-li] I thought we had a mute.

1200
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:52,734
Hey, scoot over.

1201
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:54,945
It feels like
we don't have much time left.

1202
00:51:55,028 --> 00:51:56,446
If we don't count the final pick,

1203
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:58,532
-it's almost over.
-The time flew by.

1204
00:51:58,615 --> 00:51:59,533
[Jae-yun] Right.

1205
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:04,120
But I think today would become
the biggest turning point. Yeah.

1206
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:06,665
So, today was kind of like
the midpoint check.

1207
00:52:06,748 --> 00:52:07,874
But I don't know

1208
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:09,626
-if I can pick someone else…
-Yeah.

1209
00:52:09,709 --> 00:52:12,879
…because I didn't want others
to know how I feel.

1210
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:13,922
[pensive music playing]

1211
00:52:14,005 --> 00:52:15,632
But we usually have to see…

1212
00:52:15,715 --> 00:52:17,676
Why would anyone do that on purpose?

1213
00:52:18,718 --> 00:52:20,387
-I don't get it.
-I don't know.

1214
00:52:21,179 --> 00:52:22,556
But we usually have to see

1215
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:26,935
whether that's more or less important
than a chance for a date.

1216
00:52:27,018 --> 00:52:30,397
-He… he's so… strategic. Very strategic.
-The chance for a date matters more.

1217
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,650
That's why I said it might feel like
a midpoint check, but it might not be.

1218
00:52:33,733 --> 00:52:35,610
You've really thought about this.

1219
00:52:35,694 --> 00:52:38,154
-[Hyun-kyu] I thought you…
-I know. Yeah.

1220
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:40,198
I'm always thinking about success.

1221
00:52:40,282 --> 00:52:42,450
-It's the only way to win.
-I think it'd be too much.

1222
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:44,619
-It's the only way to win.
-I think it'd be too much.

1223
00:52:44,703 --> 00:52:46,454
[Seung-li] So,
it isn't just an expectation.

1224
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:48,081
But I'm not overthinking it.

1225
00:52:48,164 --> 00:52:50,750
-But your thoughts… They do make sense.
-I have a plan, and…

1226
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:52,544
this is how I usually am.

1227
00:52:52,627 --> 00:52:54,462
I don't care about friendships
or whatever.

1228
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:56,256
I'm here with the goal of dating someone.

1229
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:59,384
-I think it's weird too, honestly.
-Yes, right.

1230
00:52:59,467 --> 00:53:01,720
-[Hyun-kyu] Didn't know I'd be like this.
-But I think…

1231
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:06,558
you need to be able to think about
the other person too.

1232
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:07,893
-Right.
-[Sang-ho] You're right.

1233
00:53:07,976 --> 00:53:10,478
You have to think
of the other person's perspective.

1234
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:12,981
I'm always talking
to the person I like before I act.

1235
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:15,984
They might not think the same way though.

1236
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:19,988
I think we're both being honest
and just ask everything.

1237
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:23,158
-And just ask everything.
-Really? You don't know that.

1238
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:30,206
But I think it's right for you
to just go ahead and do it your own way.

1239
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:31,958
Right, just do you. Go ahead and ask.

1240
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:34,920
-If you criticize me for this, I'll--
-But there's no point in asking.

1241
00:53:35,003 --> 00:53:37,797
Just criticize me.
I don't care at all. Who cares?

1242
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:38,715
Who cares?

1243
00:53:38,798 --> 00:53:41,051
[chuckles] I mean… It's just…

1244
00:53:41,134 --> 00:53:43,470
-It could be like that…
-Yes, right. It could be like that.

1245
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:45,513
In terms of those issues,
I'll deal with it myself

1246
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:47,390
-with the person involved.
-You're right.

1247
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:49,643
-[Seung-li] You do you, bro.
-Don't tell me what to do.

1248
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:53,146
Hyun-kyu must still be upset
about what happened last time.

1249
00:53:53,229 --> 00:53:54,064
[Car] Right.

1250
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:56,816
When they asked why he talked to Ji-su
for three hours alone.

1251
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:58,902
-That's definitely it.
-[Eun-ji] Yes, you're right.

1252
00:53:58,985 --> 00:54:01,154
-And Hyun-kyu is also on edge right now.
-[Car] Right.

1253
00:54:01,237 --> 00:54:03,657
-He knew that Ji-su chose Seung-li…
-[Car] Yeah.

1254
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,659
…for the night date, and I think he feels

1255
00:54:05,742 --> 00:54:08,453
-pent up from feeling anxious.
-[Eun-ji] Right, right.

1256
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:16,878
Where did everyone go?

1257
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:19,839
Are they not back?

1258
00:54:21,007 --> 00:54:22,217
Are they not back yet?

1259
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:24,803
[sighs]

1260
00:54:26,846 --> 00:54:27,681
Is it Jeong-mok?

1261
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:29,808
This is Jeong-mok's and Jae-yun's room.

1262
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:41,778
[clicks tongue]

1263
00:54:41,861 --> 00:54:43,863
[mellow music playing]

1264
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:49,536
[Do] After our date,
I decided to wait for Jeong-mok

1265
00:54:50,161 --> 00:54:51,746
right outside his room.

1266
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:55,625
There aren't many chances
to talk to Jeong-mok,

1267
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:57,419
because he's such a busy guy.

1268
00:54:57,502 --> 00:54:58,336
[chuckles]

1269
00:54:58,420 --> 00:54:59,713
I should quickly…

1270
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:02,841
[chuckles] I should quickly
snag him in order to talk to him.

1271
00:55:04,926 --> 00:55:06,428
Okay, but where is he?

1272
00:55:07,303 --> 00:55:09,055
[mellow music continues]

1273
00:55:23,778 --> 00:55:24,612
Hi.

1274
00:55:25,113 --> 00:55:26,656
Are people in the Lounge?

1275
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:27,699
I don't know.

1276
00:55:27,782 --> 00:55:29,451
Jeong-mok, so…

1277
00:55:30,368 --> 00:55:31,995
-Yeah?
-Are you tired right now?

1278
00:55:32,078 --> 00:55:33,121
Not really. Why?

1279
00:55:34,622 --> 00:55:35,999
-I thought our conversation…
-Yeah.

1280
00:55:36,082 --> 00:55:38,084
-…got cut short earlier.
-Yeah.

1281
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:40,003
Could we maybe talk some more?

1282
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:41,755
Okay.

1283
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:45,008
Let's go somewhere. These are wet now.

1284
00:55:45,091 --> 00:55:48,303
-[Jeong-mok] Is someone in the Caravan?
-Let's take a look. Hmm.

1285
00:55:48,928 --> 00:55:50,430
[Do] Here, watch your step.

1286
00:55:51,139 --> 00:55:52,515
[rustling]

1287
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:54,100
[inhales]

1288
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:56,352
There was something
I didn't ask you properly.

1289
00:55:56,436 --> 00:55:57,312
[Jeong-mok] Yeah?

1290
00:55:58,313 --> 00:56:00,732
-Can you tell me what you meant by…
-Yeah.

1291
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:04,319
-"We're not on the same wavelength"?
-Yeah.

1292
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:06,196
Is that, like,

1293
00:56:07,113 --> 00:56:11,076
mmm, something I can change
by, you know, putting in the effort,

1294
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:15,038
or is it… something
I could potentially change?

1295
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:16,498
I wanted to know that,

1296
00:56:16,581 --> 00:56:18,083
-so I was waiting to ask you.
-Yeah.

1297
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:21,711
When you put it that way,
it's… kind of hard,

1298
00:56:21,795 --> 00:56:24,589
like there's some problem or… something,

1299
00:56:24,672 --> 00:56:26,466
-but it's not. It's…
-Okay.

1300
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:28,802
"Is she in a different world than…

1301
00:56:29,385 --> 00:56:30,220
than I am?"

1302
00:56:31,096 --> 00:56:32,597
-In what way?
-I mean, what?

1303
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:35,183
-Don't we both live in Seoul?
-Well… Well, yeah.

1304
00:56:35,266 --> 00:56:36,226
[chuckles softly]

1305
00:56:37,977 --> 00:56:39,145
Does that bother you a lot?

1306
00:56:39,854 --> 00:56:40,980
Mmm…

1307
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:42,982
-Yeah, I don't…
-Right.

1308
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:45,985
-…just like you out of everyone here.
-Yeah.

1309
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:47,821
I, like, actually like you.

1310
00:56:48,696 --> 00:56:50,865
-Mmm.
-Well…

1311
00:56:51,449 --> 00:56:54,536
-So, I don't want to just…
-Mm-hmm.

1312
00:56:54,619 --> 00:56:56,538
…sit back and not do anything.

1313
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:58,706
-Not do anything?
-Right.

1314
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:01,000
I want things

1315
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:02,877
-to develop into something real.
-Right.

1316
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:05,964
-And to do that, I have to make an effort.
-Hmm.

1317
00:57:07,632 --> 00:57:10,301
Earlier, I asked you
about your ideal relationship.

1318
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:12,929
-Yeah.
-You remember what you told me?

1319
00:57:14,305 --> 00:57:15,473
[chuckles softly] Yeah.

1320
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:17,058
[mellow music playing]

1321
00:57:17,142 --> 00:57:18,434
EARLIER TODAY

1322
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:21,312
What do you think
is your ideal relationship?

1323
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:24,107
Being able to be myself.

1324
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:26,734
So, rather than telling each other,

1325
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:28,319
"You have to do this, and change."

1326
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:31,906
I want to be able to keep
my values and core beliefs

1327
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:35,493
because that's what I want…
in a relationship.

1328
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:36,536
Mmm.

1329
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:39,581
-You remember?
-[chuckles]

1330
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:42,917
I remember, but that's…

1331
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:46,045
under the premise that we start dating.

1332
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:48,339
-Right.
-That's right.

1333
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:51,843
I want us to be on the same wavelength.

1334
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:53,928
[chuckles softly]

1335
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:59,267
Am I, like, trying too hard or something?

1336
00:58:00,351 --> 00:58:02,228
[splutters] Well, so… How should I put it?

1337
00:58:02,854 --> 00:58:06,274
I… don't mean, "You have a problem…

1338
00:58:06,357 --> 00:58:07,400
[Do chuckles]

1339
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,819
-…and you need to change."
-Yeah. Yes.

1340
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:11,154
No, that's not it at all.

1341
00:58:11,237 --> 00:58:13,490
-I'm just saying that's how I felt.
-Oh…

1342
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:15,909
[Do] "Don't try hard"?

1343
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:17,827
What does that mean?

1344
00:58:18,369 --> 00:58:22,248
"Even if you try, that's… your limit,

1345
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:24,042
so don't even try"?

1346
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:26,419
Is that… what he was saying,

1347
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:30,215
or did he mean, like,
"You don't have to try so hard"?

1348
00:58:30,298 --> 00:58:32,217
I just… couldn't figure it out.

1349
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,052
It was so hard.

1350
00:58:36,638 --> 00:58:37,639
[music fades]

1351
00:58:37,722 --> 00:58:39,307
Did you have a…

1352
00:58:40,808 --> 00:58:42,185
change of heart?

1353
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:47,106
Did I have a change of heart?

1354
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:48,691
-[gasps]
-[Car] Just tell her!

1355
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:51,027
A change of heart. A change of heart…

1356
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:53,071
[low tense music playing]

1357
00:58:53,154 --> 00:58:54,572
[sighs] A change of heart.

1358
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:57,200
Mmm, I get it.

1359
00:58:58,868 --> 00:59:02,539
[clicks tongue] I think I'd be lying
if I said I didn't change my mind at all.

1360
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:03,790
[gasps]

1361
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:07,293
Yeo-myung has a place in his heart now.

1362
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:09,128
-He had a change of heart?
-A little bit.

1363
00:59:09,212 --> 00:59:10,838
Ah. Oh, my God. Save me.

1364
00:59:10,922 --> 00:59:12,882
[Han-na] Didn't know
Jeong-mok would be like this.

1365
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:14,759
-I'm gonna lose it.
-[Car] Wow!

1366
00:59:14,842 --> 00:59:17,345
I never thought Jeong-mok would be…
I didn't think he'd change.

1367
00:59:17,428 --> 00:59:20,098
-[Eun-ji] What do we do?
-Feel like something's stuck in my throat.

1368
00:59:20,181 --> 00:59:22,976
-This is so hard for me. God, I…
-[Han-na] They were almost a couple.

1369
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:26,145
Hey, hey, don't you feel a knot
right there? Right now, she's…

1370
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:27,438
[laughing]

1371
00:59:27,522 --> 00:59:29,232
-What are we gonna do?
-It could happen.

1372
00:59:29,315 --> 00:59:31,317
-Jeong-mok might change his mind.
-He's only human.

1373
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:33,736
He had good conversations
with the other girls,

1374
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:35,488
-and the mood was great too.
-[In-guk] Oh.

1375
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:37,699
-Especially with Yeo-myung.
-[In-guk] Mmm.

1376
00:59:37,782 --> 00:59:38,616
But?

1377
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:39,867
[both laughing]

1378
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:42,620
-[Car] We lost Eun-Ji!
-She's lying down. This isn't a hospital.

1379
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:45,123
-You're not in the hospital.
-[Car] What is happening?

1380
00:59:45,206 --> 00:59:46,624
God, this is driving me nuts.

1381
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:49,127
When did Jeong-mok have a change of heart?

1382
00:59:49,210 --> 00:59:50,712
Maybe they're on the same wavelength?

1383
00:59:50,795 --> 00:59:53,047
-[In-guk] Right.
-They were, and they're both in college.

1384
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:54,382
Yeo-myung is a student too.

1385
00:59:54,465 --> 00:59:56,134
[breathlessly] I can't breathe.

1386
00:59:58,177 --> 01:00:00,513
-So, with which person?
-[Jeong-mok] I mean, a bit…

1387
01:00:02,223 --> 01:00:05,893
It's about the same
as what I said earlier, so…

1388
01:00:06,477 --> 01:00:08,730
Until now, I thought I should date

1389
01:00:09,314 --> 01:00:13,234
someone who I felt
romantically attracted to,

1390
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:15,403
-[softly] Mmm
-…but I think that…

1391
01:00:15,486 --> 01:00:17,363
that might not be the case.

1392
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:18,573
Hmm.

1393
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:20,450
[exhales]

1394
01:00:20,533 --> 01:00:23,786
[smacks lips] I am to blame. I am.

1395
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:25,038
What?

1396
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:26,956
[chuckles softly] What'd you do wrong?

1397
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:30,126
I don't know. [chuckles softly]

1398
01:00:33,087 --> 01:00:33,921
[sighing] Ah.

1399
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:37,759
You're such a busy man.

1400
01:00:37,842 --> 01:00:39,052
I'm so busy.

1401
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:41,638
-Do you know how many hours I waited…
-I am…

1402
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:43,514
…to talk to you once today?

1403
01:00:43,598 --> 01:00:45,224
Oh, I… I'm sorry.

1404
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:46,893
I kept fixing my makeup

1405
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:49,520
-and looking in the mirror.
-Really?

1406
01:00:51,689 --> 01:00:54,442
[Han-na] Oh, I can feel how uncomfortable
Jeong-mok is right now.

1407
01:00:54,525 --> 01:00:56,110
[Do] I wore my…

1408
01:00:56,986 --> 01:00:59,739
-favorite pair of earrings today.
-Yeah.

1409
01:00:59,822 --> 01:01:02,283
But was it all for nothing?

1410
01:01:03,117 --> 01:01:03,951
They're pretty.

1411
01:01:04,452 --> 01:01:06,162
You don't sound sincere.

1412
01:01:06,245 --> 01:01:07,705
But I am being sincere.

1413
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:08,956
How can I be more…

1414
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:11,501
-[melancholic music playing]
-[chuckles]

1415
01:01:11,584 --> 01:01:15,088
I wanted to show you
a different side of me than usual.

1416
01:01:16,381 --> 01:01:19,050
-I wanted to look pretty…
-Yeah.

1417
01:01:19,634 --> 01:01:21,552
…so I wore my pretty shoes,

1418
01:01:22,053 --> 01:01:23,971
but they kept falling off.
[chuckles softly]

1419
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:26,974
-So I changed into sliders.
-[In-guk] Oh, my God.

1420
01:01:27,058 --> 01:01:29,936
He can't even make
eye contact with her anymore.

1421
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:30,853
I'm not leaving.

1422
01:01:31,771 --> 01:01:33,231
-Where?
-From here.

1423
01:01:36,734 --> 01:01:38,319
-[music fades]
-Mmm.

1424
01:01:38,403 --> 01:01:39,946
-What is this?
-What?

1425
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:43,116
-That's probably Ji-yeon's glasses case.
-What?

1426
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:45,535
-Why is that here?
-Oh, she said she lost it,

1427
01:01:45,618 --> 01:01:47,078
but I guess I just found it.

1428
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:49,914
Oh, I have to give Ji-yeon her tangerines.
That's right.

1429
01:01:50,498 --> 01:01:51,499
Mmm.

1430
01:01:52,083 --> 01:01:53,626
I'll deliver this to her…

1431
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:55,920
-The tangerines? Those too?
-…along with the tangerines.

1432
01:01:56,003 --> 01:01:57,463
[wistful music playing]

1433
01:01:58,047 --> 01:01:59,799
Ji-yeon must've been here yesterday.

1434
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:01,676
Mmm. Mm.

1435
01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:05,513
When are you going to bed?

1436
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:07,598
[sighs] I'm not sure.

1437
01:02:07,682 --> 01:02:09,100
[Car] He won't even look at her.

1438
01:02:09,183 --> 01:02:12,353
What's this? It's like when a boyfriend
starts falling out of love.

1439
01:02:12,437 --> 01:02:14,564
It's the same facial expression.

1440
01:02:14,647 --> 01:02:15,773
-Oh, no.
-Ugh!

1441
01:02:15,857 --> 01:02:18,943
This is totally like that. They're like
a couple going through a rough patch.

1442
01:02:19,026 --> 01:02:21,612
-That's what it feels like.
-Feels like they're going through it.

1443
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:23,740
Exactly what couples look like
before they break up.

1444
01:02:23,823 --> 01:02:26,909
-Staring at your phone and stuff.
-And you just talk half-heartedly.

1445
01:02:26,993 --> 01:02:28,536
There seems to have been a point

1446
01:02:28,619 --> 01:02:31,998
when Jeong-mok was sure
his mind had changed about Do.

1447
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:35,209
"I don't think this is it for me.
I don't think I like this person."

1448
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:39,213
If I go to the Lounge, I might get caught
and won't be able to leave.

1449
01:02:39,297 --> 01:02:40,965
Then don't go in.

1450
01:02:41,048 --> 01:02:42,759
What? But the others…

1451
01:02:42,842 --> 01:02:45,219
The other… guys are there, right?

1452
01:02:45,803 --> 01:02:46,637
Are they?

1453
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:49,640
Should I not go in?

1454
01:02:50,475 --> 01:02:51,684
-It's up to you.
-Really?

1455
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:55,354
I'd rather you didn't.
So why… don't you stay with me?

1456
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:57,690
I'll stay then.

1457
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:00,318
[chuckles drily]

1458
01:03:00,985 --> 01:03:01,944
Okay.

1459
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:05,531
[clicks tongue] Damn.

1460
01:03:05,615 --> 01:03:07,700
What's wrong with me?
Should I take some painkillers?

1461
01:03:07,784 --> 01:03:09,702
-Why?
-I have a headache.

1462
01:03:11,579 --> 01:03:12,789
Do you need a massage?

1463
01:03:13,372 --> 01:03:14,791
-No, I'm fine.
-Really?

1464
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:16,334
Is your pillow comfy?

1465
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:19,170
-[Han-na] Oh.
-[In-guk] Seems like he wants to say

1466
01:03:19,253 --> 01:03:20,213
that he needs a break.

1467
01:03:20,296 --> 01:03:22,548
[Han-na] Right,
he wants to leave the Caravan.

1468
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:24,759
[melancholic music continues]

1469
01:03:24,842 --> 01:03:26,052
[chuckles drily]

1470
01:03:28,596 --> 01:03:29,430
[music fades]

1471
01:03:30,389 --> 01:03:31,766
[Jeong-mok] Aren't you hungry?

1472
01:03:31,849 --> 01:03:34,477
-No. I just lost my appetite.
-Really?

1473
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:36,354
-Are you?
-A bit. I thought…

1474
01:03:36,437 --> 01:03:37,897
-Really?
-"Should we go to the Lounge

1475
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:39,816
-to see if there's food?"
-Ah.

1476
01:03:39,899 --> 01:03:41,901
-I'm starving. Should we go?
-What?

1477
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:45,071
Oh, this is Ji-yeon's.
I gotta give Ji-yeon tangerines.

1478
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:47,281
Wait, what about Ji-yeon?

1479
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:50,910
Ji-yeon said she wanted to eat some.

1480
01:03:50,993 --> 01:03:52,745
-Mmm.
-But she couldn't eat today either.

1481
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:54,664
-[Do] Oh, is that it?
-It's to comfort her.

1482
01:03:54,747 --> 01:03:55,832
[Do] Mmm.

1483
01:03:56,457 --> 01:03:58,334
Hey, wait. Ji-yeon… [inhales sharply]

1484
01:03:58,876 --> 01:04:01,045
-Maybe he has feelings for her.
-[Eun-ji] Just friends.

1485
01:04:01,128 --> 01:04:03,047
He wouldn't have said that
if he liked Ji-yeon.

1486
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:04,090
That's true.

1487
01:04:06,384 --> 01:04:07,969
[Min-hong] I have a free hand now.

1488
01:04:08,761 --> 01:04:11,764
Hey! We're drinking Hallasan.
Want to join us?

1489
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:13,808
-[Jae-yun] There's sashimi too.
-There's sashimi?

1490
01:04:14,308 --> 01:04:17,436
-[Min-hong] We should hurry back.
-You should've told me sooner. What?

1491
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,730
[Min-hong] We practically
opened up a tent bar.

1492
01:04:19,814 --> 01:04:20,815
-Really?
-[Min-hong] Yeah.

1493
01:04:20,898 --> 01:04:22,525
[Jae-yun] Min-hong prepared everything.

1494
01:04:22,608 --> 01:04:23,526
[Min-hong chuckles]

1495
01:04:23,609 --> 01:04:26,195
-No, I did it with Ji-yeon.
-Ji-yeon got hurt… She hurt her hand.

1496
01:04:26,279 --> 01:04:29,156
-He's really concerned about Ji-yeon.
-[Min-hong] Ji-yeon is over there.

1497
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:30,950
Didn't Ji-yeon hurt her hand?

1498
01:04:31,033 --> 01:04:32,743
[Min-hong] Yeah, but it's much better now.

1499
01:04:32,827 --> 01:04:33,661
[Jeong-mok] Really?

1500
01:04:33,744 --> 01:04:35,746
[melancholic music playing]

1501
01:04:40,334 --> 01:04:41,878
[door lock beeping]

1502
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:42,795
[door closes]

1503
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:43,754
[shouts]

1504
01:04:45,339 --> 01:04:46,507
[breathing heavily]

1505
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:55,349
Oh, wait. The energy has suddenly shifted.

1506
01:04:55,433 --> 01:04:56,684
This is literally crazy.

1507
01:04:56,767 --> 01:04:59,770
See, no matter what happened,
in every situation,

1508
01:04:59,854 --> 01:05:02,315
Jeong-mok always… took care of Do.

1509
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:03,232
Right, right.

1510
01:05:03,316 --> 01:05:05,109
It's clear he found her attractive,

1511
01:05:05,192 --> 01:05:06,569
-that was obvious.
-[exclaims]

1512
01:05:06,652 --> 01:05:09,363
[In-guk] But right now, he left Do behind

1513
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:13,075
and just ran off in… the other direction.

1514
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:15,453
I mean, the look in Jeong-mok's eyes

1515
01:05:15,536 --> 01:05:17,914
is different from
how they were in the earlier date.

1516
01:05:17,997 --> 01:05:19,123
Totally different.

1517
01:05:19,206 --> 01:05:20,416
[music fades]

1518
01:05:20,499 --> 01:05:21,584
[Hyun-kyu] You just got up?

1519
01:05:21,667 --> 01:05:23,669
[Ji-su] Yeah,
I kept sleeping since I got back.

1520
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:24,879
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

1521
01:05:26,088 --> 01:05:27,632
I left something in your mailbox.

1522
01:05:27,715 --> 01:05:29,342
I haven't opened my mailbox yet.

1523
01:05:29,425 --> 01:05:30,968
-What did you drop off?
-Some candy.

1524
01:05:31,052 --> 01:05:32,803
-Candy.
-Some candy?

1525
01:05:32,887 --> 01:05:35,389
Since there's two candies,
you and Yeo-myung can have one each.

1526
01:05:35,473 --> 01:05:36,515
Oh, thanks.

1527
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:39,143
[Hyun-kyu] So, I want to go
somewhere quiet.

1528
01:05:39,226 --> 01:05:40,645
Maybe the Caravan?

1529
01:05:40,728 --> 01:05:41,896
[Ji-su chuckles] Go inside.

1530
01:05:41,979 --> 01:05:44,023
[Hyun-kyu] What did…
What did I write in the letter?

1531
01:05:44,106 --> 01:05:45,608
[cheerful music playing]

1532
01:05:45,691 --> 01:05:47,652
I wrote down that I would wait.

1533
01:05:47,735 --> 01:05:49,236
"I think it'd be easier

1534
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:53,324
for me to imagine your ideal future
if I felt more assurance."

1535
01:05:53,991 --> 01:05:55,409
I wrote something like that.

1536
01:05:56,661 --> 01:05:57,787
-What?
-Huh?

1537
01:05:58,663 --> 01:06:00,790
-What?
-You said, "Give it some thought,"

1538
01:06:00,873 --> 01:06:03,334
-but you want me to pick you.
-It's true… [chuckles]

1539
01:06:03,417 --> 01:06:04,251
[Ji-su] Hmm.

1540
01:06:04,335 --> 01:06:05,378
And I…

1541
01:06:05,461 --> 01:06:07,046
I had a dream yesterday.

1542
01:06:07,129 --> 01:06:08,464
Yeah, it said that.

1543
01:06:08,547 --> 01:06:10,591
And… I know I don't even
know your brother, but--

1544
01:06:10,675 --> 01:06:12,510
You dreamt about my brother?

1545
01:06:12,593 --> 01:06:14,136
I think I was being introduced to him.

1546
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:16,555
We went somewhere together,
and it was scary.

1547
01:06:17,139 --> 01:06:19,600
I was like,
"Hello, sir. Nice to meet you."

1548
01:06:19,684 --> 01:06:22,687
I was kind of intimidated.
I said, "Nice to meet you."

1549
01:06:22,770 --> 01:06:25,606
Then he laughed in a mischievous way,
like "Ha-ha, ha-ha."

1550
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:29,777
Then he glared at me and was about to
say something, but then I woke up.

1551
01:06:29,860 --> 01:06:31,237
-[uneasy music playing]
-[chuckles]

1552
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:33,239
You met my family in your dream?

1553
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:34,991
No, it wasn't that formal.

1554
01:06:35,074 --> 01:06:37,785
I didn't try to have that dream.
I'm not, like, a psychic.

1555
01:06:38,327 --> 01:06:40,287
Because I was scared I went, "Phew."

1556
01:06:40,371 --> 01:06:41,622
Why did I go, "Phew?"

1557
01:06:41,706 --> 01:06:44,375
Well, I'm not really sure,
but it was funny to me.

1558
01:06:44,875 --> 01:06:47,420
[Car] What the hell is he talking about?

1559
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:49,255
But…

1560
01:06:50,047 --> 01:06:50,881
[music fades]

1561
01:06:50,965 --> 01:06:52,466
Well, uh…

1562
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:58,180
From now on,
you're going to become very busy.

1563
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:03,686
Mmm. I don't think doctors have a lot
of free time on their hands, you know?

1564
01:07:03,769 --> 01:07:05,688
-So I've been thinking about it…
-Yeah.

1565
01:07:06,355 --> 01:07:08,107
I… made some notes. [chuckles softly]

1566
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:11,068
[chuckling incredulously] Oh, you even
wrote it on your notes app.

1567
01:07:11,152 --> 01:07:14,780
So, first, I'll study. Since you'll work
until lunchtime on weekdays,

1568
01:07:15,364 --> 01:07:17,908
we could have lunch
and you could hang out,

1569
01:07:17,992 --> 01:07:20,494
-or you could come hang out in Heukseok.
-Okay.

1570
01:07:20,578 --> 01:07:23,414
Then I'll keep studying,
then come out around dinnertime…

1571
01:07:23,497 --> 01:07:25,249
-[chuckles]
-…to have dinner with you.

1572
01:07:25,332 --> 01:07:27,585
If you have work to do,
we could go to a cafe,

1573
01:07:27,668 --> 01:07:29,879
and you could work and I could study.

1574
01:07:29,962 --> 01:07:31,130
-Okay.
-I'm an intern,

1575
01:07:31,213 --> 01:07:34,550
but interns have a day off
for every overnight night shift you do.

1576
01:07:34,633 --> 01:07:37,303
On those days, I could just sleep
for a few hours during the day.

1577
01:07:37,386 --> 01:07:39,889
I'd just have to…
adjust the week's schedule.

1578
01:07:39,972 --> 01:07:41,891
-[Eun-ji exclaims]
-So, on my days off,

1579
01:07:41,974 --> 01:07:44,935
I could sleep for a few hours,
hang out with you in the evening.

1580
01:07:45,436 --> 01:07:48,481
But I'd have to go home early to sleep.
Around ten or eleven o'clock.

1581
01:07:48,564 --> 01:07:50,066
-Okay.
-[Han-na] Wait, stop there.

1582
01:07:50,149 --> 01:07:53,235
And I could apply for a hospital in Jeju,
instead of Chung-Ang University.

1583
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:55,279
Do, like, a one-month stay or something.

1584
01:07:55,780 --> 01:07:56,947
Actually,

1585
01:07:57,031 --> 01:07:59,408
-I'd like to…
-[Car] Stop talking. Stop it.

1586
01:07:59,492 --> 01:08:02,745
-He sounds like he's rapping! With a beat.
-[laughing] A beat.

1587
01:08:02,828 --> 01:08:05,372
-Isn't this like a Chang Ki-ha's song?
-[Car] It's like Ki-ha.

1588
01:08:05,456 --> 01:08:08,667
♪ You can come hang out in Heukseok
But if I get a break in between ♪

1589
01:08:08,751 --> 01:08:09,752
♪ I could go to you ♪

1590
01:08:09,835 --> 01:08:13,714
♪ I could also choose a hospital in Jeju
Instead of Chung-Ang University's ♪

1591
01:08:13,798 --> 01:08:15,591
-That's hilarious.
-[Eun-ji laughs]

1592
01:08:15,674 --> 01:08:18,677
But even Chang Ki-ha is less wordy…
than this guy.

1593
01:08:18,761 --> 01:08:20,221
-[laughs]
-[Eun-ji laughs]

1594
01:08:20,304 --> 01:08:21,305
The words in his lyrics.

1595
01:08:21,388 --> 01:08:22,473
-He's more concise.
-Yeah.

1596
01:08:22,556 --> 01:08:24,642
What should I do? I can't watch this.

1597
01:08:25,226 --> 01:08:26,894
Oh, I'll come live here with you?

1598
01:08:26,977 --> 01:08:29,355
I mean, I could look into another area.

1599
01:08:29,438 --> 01:08:31,190
That's not decided.

1600
01:08:31,273 --> 01:08:33,192
[Ji-su] He's thought it all through.

1601
01:08:33,275 --> 01:08:35,069
"I'm going to live like this."

1602
01:08:35,152 --> 01:08:37,863
"If that's the case,
I'll have these days off,

1603
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:40,449
and the next day, no breakfast,

1604
01:08:40,533 --> 01:08:42,243
but we could meet for dinner."

1605
01:08:42,326 --> 01:08:46,705
This is a red flag that I had
never even considered until now.

1606
01:08:46,789 --> 01:08:47,832
[chuckles]

1607
01:08:47,915 --> 01:08:50,584
I thought, "Oh, this is a bit too much."

1608
01:08:52,044 --> 01:08:53,712
[Jae-yun] Thanks for talking to me.

1609
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:56,674
-Should… should we go for a walk?
-[Yeo-myung] Great job. Oh… Okay.

1610
01:08:57,258 --> 01:08:58,134
To talk?

1611
01:08:58,217 --> 01:08:59,677
-[Do] Bye, guys!
-[Jae-yun] Yes.

1612
01:09:00,511 --> 01:09:01,846
-I mean, it's not…
-Okay.

1613
01:09:01,929 --> 01:09:04,098
-[Jae-yun] It's not anything serious.
-Okay.

1614
01:09:04,181 --> 01:09:05,474
[Jae-yun] I just…

1615
01:09:06,225 --> 01:09:08,310
-I've been feeling really bad.
-Why?

1616
01:09:08,394 --> 01:09:09,854
[insects trilling]

1617
01:09:10,813 --> 01:09:13,274
[Jae-yun] Well, so the things
I said to you were…

1618
01:09:13,357 --> 01:09:15,401
-[Yeo-myung] Yeah?
-They were…

1619
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:16,318
[Yeo-myung] Mmm.

1620
01:09:17,111 --> 01:09:19,071
[Jae-yun] I think they were
a little exaggerated,

1621
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:20,406
-so I--
-Exaggerated?

1622
01:09:20,489 --> 01:09:22,533
-[Jae-yun] Kind of, a bit.
-Okay.

1623
01:09:24,869 --> 01:09:26,287
[Jae-yun] At the start of the date,

1624
01:09:26,370 --> 01:09:29,290
I should've asked
if you were sure about someone first…

1625
01:09:29,373 --> 01:09:30,249
[Yeo-myung] Yeah.

1626
01:09:30,332 --> 01:09:31,167
…and then decided

1627
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:33,043
-whether or not it was right to…
-Yeah.

1628
01:09:33,127 --> 01:09:34,962
-Right.
-…express my feelings.

1629
01:09:35,045 --> 01:09:36,130
Right.

1630
01:09:36,714 --> 01:09:38,382
You know, I had kind of just…

1631
01:09:39,466 --> 01:09:43,304
assumed that you weren't,
like, interested in anyone at all.

1632
01:09:43,387 --> 01:09:44,305
I see.

1633
01:09:44,388 --> 01:09:46,849
I didn't think you were,
so I thought it was okay…

1634
01:09:46,932 --> 01:09:49,101
-Right.
-…to express my feelings.

1635
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:50,019
[Yeo-myung] Right.

1636
01:09:50,102 --> 01:09:51,270
-[Jae-yun] But…
-Yeah.

1637
01:09:51,896 --> 01:09:53,731
…I really felt that things

1638
01:09:53,814 --> 01:09:55,900
-were going well for you and…
-I see.

1639
01:09:56,609 --> 01:09:57,610
…someone else.

1640
01:09:58,736 --> 01:10:01,780
Then I intruded and made things awkward.

1641
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:03,073
[solemn music playing]

1642
01:10:03,157 --> 01:10:05,576
I felt really bad about that.

1643
01:10:06,368 --> 01:10:07,953
So before I met Yeo-myung,

1644
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:11,165
I felt that
she wasn't really set on anyone yet.

1645
01:10:11,248 --> 01:10:12,416
That was my impression.

1646
01:10:13,209 --> 01:10:17,338
Because of that,
I thought she'd lean more my way

1647
01:10:17,421 --> 01:10:20,674
if I expressed my feelings
clearly and more directly.

1648
01:10:22,134 --> 01:10:25,054
I thought she was undecided,
but it turns out…

1649
01:10:26,555 --> 01:10:31,936
I do have someone that I am interested in.

1650
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:37,024
[Jae-yun] I feel really bad
that I confused Yeo-myung,

1651
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:43,113
who was already interested… in,
and doing quite well with someone else.

1652
01:10:43,197 --> 01:10:44,156
Yeah.

1653
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:45,324
So I plan to

1654
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:47,701
talk to Yeo-myung a little…

1655
01:10:48,953 --> 01:10:50,162
a little more.

1656
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:52,957
And hopefully, we can clear the air.

1657
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:54,667
[inaudible]

1658
01:10:56,252 --> 01:10:57,461
-So, actually, I…
-Yeah.

1659
01:10:57,544 --> 01:10:59,171
-I was just trying to say…
-Yeah.

1660
01:11:00,464 --> 01:11:02,675
…that what I said was really exaggerated.

1661
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:06,178
So my…

1662
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:08,514
my… my feelings
were at like a level five.

1663
01:11:08,597 --> 01:11:09,431
Yeah.

1664
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:14,019
But I… feel like I…
feel like I took it to 100.

1665
01:11:15,187 --> 01:11:16,397
-Oh, right.
-Yeah.

1666
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:18,565
I mean… it's a bit weird.

1667
01:11:18,649 --> 01:11:20,985
We… we really haven't
talked very much at all…

1668
01:11:21,068 --> 01:11:24,071
-Yeah. Yeah.
-…so it didn't really make sense to…

1669
01:11:24,154 --> 01:11:26,407
…express my feelings so strongly.

1670
01:11:27,658 --> 01:11:29,660
[pensive music playing]

1671
01:11:31,662 --> 01:11:33,163
[Jae-yun] So I lied,

1672
01:11:33,247 --> 01:11:37,876
thinking… that would maybe put Yeo-myung

1673
01:11:39,128 --> 01:11:40,337
more at ease.

1674
01:11:40,838 --> 01:11:42,715
-Oh, what?
-[In-guk] He actually lied?

1675
01:11:42,798 --> 01:11:45,134
-He really was at 100.
-[Han-na gasps]

1676
01:11:45,217 --> 01:11:46,760
It's most apparent with Jae-yun

1677
01:11:46,844 --> 01:11:50,723
that he hasn't had relationships
with women before.

1678
01:11:50,806 --> 01:11:53,309
-[Han-na] Mmm.
-Yeah. He's totally making assumptions.

1679
01:11:53,392 --> 01:11:55,936
I think he's trying to be nice by lying.

1680
01:11:56,020 --> 01:11:59,064
You can just do what you want, Jae-yun.
What are you doing?

1681
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:00,232
[In-guk] Seriously.

1682
01:12:01,233 --> 01:12:03,736
It wasn't… really like that at all.

1683
01:12:03,819 --> 01:12:06,989
-I… wasn't super into you or anything.
-Okay.

1684
01:12:07,072 --> 01:12:08,699
Just… interested.

1685
01:12:09,450 --> 01:12:10,993
-Okay.
-Since you've already…

1686
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:13,996
decided on someone, maybe just…

1687
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:18,042
focus on thinking about that person
and nobody else.

1688
01:12:21,003 --> 01:12:24,798
So, what you're saying
is that you wanted to tell me

1689
01:12:24,882 --> 01:12:28,218
that this whole time,
you really weren't that into me, right?

1690
01:12:28,802 --> 01:12:31,638
If things are going well
with you and someone else,

1691
01:12:31,722 --> 01:12:33,724
then… focus on them.

1692
01:12:35,017 --> 01:12:37,728
I mean, it's not my place
to tell you what to do,

1693
01:12:37,811 --> 01:12:39,104
but I think you should

1694
01:12:39,938 --> 01:12:42,024
just focus on that person.

1695
01:12:43,901 --> 01:12:44,902
[music fades]

1696
01:12:47,029 --> 01:12:48,072
What? [chuckles]

1697
01:12:48,864 --> 01:12:51,116
Oh, did what I say not make…

1698
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:53,202
[splutters] How do I…
How should I say this?

1699
01:12:53,285 --> 01:12:54,244
No, it's…

1700
01:12:54,328 --> 01:12:55,245
No, it's just…

1701
01:12:55,329 --> 01:12:56,955
[pensive music playing]

1702
01:12:57,039 --> 01:12:59,375
-Oh, I'm just kind of taken aback.
-I didn't-- I…

1703
01:12:59,458 --> 01:13:00,376
I get that.

1704
01:13:01,418 --> 01:13:03,879
[chuckles] I was taken aback.

1705
01:13:03,962 --> 01:13:05,172
I… Yeah…

1706
01:13:05,255 --> 01:13:09,927
I wasn't interested in Jae-yun
and didn't think much of him.

1707
01:13:10,010 --> 01:13:11,136
I thought to myself,

1708
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:14,098
"What is this one-man show
this guy's putting on?"

1709
01:13:19,645 --> 01:13:22,606
Well, just to let you know, you never once

1710
01:13:22,689 --> 01:13:26,110
-made me uncomfortable in any way, okay?
-Mmm.

1711
01:13:26,860 --> 01:13:27,694
Also,

1712
01:13:28,737 --> 01:13:29,988
in the afternoon,

1713
01:13:30,072 --> 01:13:34,827
you… kept saying, "I was into you
since the first day we met,"

1714
01:13:34,910 --> 01:13:36,370
but now it's changed?

1715
01:13:36,453 --> 01:13:40,916
You're saying, "Actually, I think
that I'm not that into you."

1716
01:13:40,999 --> 01:13:43,460
I mean, how am I supposed to take that?

1717
01:13:44,044 --> 01:13:45,295
I mean, well…

1718
01:13:45,379 --> 01:13:46,338
[pensive music playing]

1719
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:48,382
I just can't really understand that.

1720
01:13:48,966 --> 01:13:50,092
-Mmm.
-You get me?

1721
01:13:52,970 --> 01:13:53,887
Yeah.

1722
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:59,059
So you… you said you
had someone you liked.

1723
01:13:59,726 --> 01:14:00,894
Yeah.

1724
01:14:01,812 --> 01:14:06,191
But even if I have decided on someone

1725
01:14:07,234 --> 01:14:11,697
or if things just definitely
don't end up working out with him,

1726
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:14,324
I mean, this may be kind of harsh,

1727
01:14:15,576 --> 01:14:18,036
but, honestly, you have absolutely…

1728
01:14:19,496 --> 01:14:21,206
no right whatsoever

1729
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:24,376
to tell me what I should do
about my situation.

1730
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:26,462
[pensive music playing]

1731
01:14:30,757 --> 01:14:31,592
I mean…

1732
01:14:32,217 --> 01:14:34,386
So, right now, I feel taken aback.

1733
01:14:38,098 --> 01:14:41,018
So, right now, you're not into me,

1734
01:14:41,101 --> 01:14:44,271
and you wanted to confess
and tell me that.

1735
01:14:47,065 --> 01:14:49,359
-Did I understand that correctly?
-Yeah. Yeah.

1736
01:14:50,402 --> 01:14:51,487
Well, okay then.

1737
01:14:52,112 --> 01:14:53,614
[music turns dramatic]

1738
01:14:53,697 --> 01:14:54,531
I just…

1739
01:14:55,908 --> 01:14:58,285
hope things go… well with him.

1740
01:14:59,578 --> 01:15:00,496
I mean it.

1741
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:02,414
Thank you.

1742
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:03,999
[dramatic music rises]

1743
01:15:04,791 --> 01:15:06,001
I'll try my best.

1744
01:15:06,585 --> 01:15:07,419
Okay.

1745
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:08,337
[music subsides]

1746
01:15:08,921 --> 01:15:10,923
-That's all you wanted to say?
-Yeah.

1747
01:15:12,382 --> 01:15:13,717
-What?
-Should I go first, then?

1748
01:15:13,800 --> 01:15:15,344
Oh, yeah. I… I think you can go first.

1749
01:15:15,427 --> 01:15:17,554
I mean, things got really messed up.

1750
01:15:17,638 --> 01:15:18,472
Wow.

1751
01:15:18,555 --> 01:15:20,224
[dramatic music continues]

1752
01:15:20,307 --> 01:15:23,310
This isn't good.
Jae-yun is going to cry in his room again.

1753
01:15:23,393 --> 01:15:24,645
[Jae-yun sighs heavily]

1754
01:15:25,187 --> 01:15:26,813
[Jae-yun] I've been thinking…

1755
01:15:28,023 --> 01:15:29,399
a lot about it,

1756
01:15:29,483 --> 01:15:31,151
and what I said was out of line.

1757
01:15:32,903 --> 01:15:33,737
It really…

1758
01:15:34,655 --> 01:15:36,615
wasn't any of my business.

1759
01:15:38,408 --> 01:15:40,244
[dramatic music continues]

1760
01:15:41,828 --> 01:15:43,455
[sighs heavily]

1761
01:15:54,091 --> 01:15:57,052
[Yeo-myung] I'm in shock right now,
so I wanted to talk to someone.

1762
01:15:57,135 --> 01:16:00,430
-[Ji-yeon] Okay. Should we sit here?
-It's not about that. I'm so dumbfounded.

1763
01:16:00,514 --> 01:16:02,766
-Oh, what is it?
-I don't know what just happened.

1764
01:16:02,849 --> 01:16:04,476
[Ji-yeon] One second. I rolled my ankle.

1765
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:06,395
-[Yeo-myung] Get it together.
-[Ji-yeon] Yeah.

1766
01:16:06,478 --> 01:16:08,981
-[Jae-yun] Uh, oh, God…
-[Ji-yeon] Should we sit here?

1767
01:16:09,064 --> 01:16:10,190
[Eun-ji laughing] Oh, my!

1768
01:16:10,274 --> 01:16:11,692
-He hid.
-[In-guk laughing]

1769
01:16:11,775 --> 01:16:13,944
-What is that?
-[Han-na] He hid in the reeds.

1770
01:16:14,027 --> 01:16:15,320
He did not do that!

1771
01:16:15,404 --> 01:16:16,572
This is staged, right?

1772
01:16:16,655 --> 01:16:19,825
-This was staged. This can't be real!
-No way. This is not actually happening!

1773
01:16:19,908 --> 01:16:23,954
-Come on. They can't see him hiding there?
-[Eun-ji] No way. What is this? I mean…

1774
01:16:24,037 --> 01:16:26,331
-I mean, who hides?
-I'm unsubscribing!

1775
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:27,916
-[Han-na] Unsubscribe.
-This, Netflix.

1776
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,210
-I mean… Okay, playback.
-Wait, let us see it again.

1777
01:16:30,294 --> 01:16:31,628
-Play it.
-Let's see a playback.

1778
01:16:31,712 --> 01:16:33,338
[Ji-yeon] One second. I rolled my ankle.

1779
01:16:33,422 --> 01:16:35,257
-[Yeo-myung] Get it together.
-[Ji-yeon] Yeah.

1780
01:16:35,340 --> 01:16:37,467
-[Jae-yun] Uh, oh, God…
-[Ji-yeon] Should we sit here?

1781
01:16:37,551 --> 01:16:39,928
-I can't breathe. I'm in disbelief.
-[Yeo-myung] Come on.

1782
01:16:40,012 --> 01:16:42,639
-I mean, did he actually just lie down?
-[Eun-ji] Is that right?

1783
01:16:42,723 --> 01:16:44,975
-Oh, God, no!
-He actually lied down on his stomach.

1784
01:16:45,058 --> 01:16:49,271
He's lying on his side, not just sitting.
Look, he's basically lying on his side.

1785
01:16:49,354 --> 01:16:52,733
-Oh, like a dog? Like this?
-Totally. I think I saw an arm just now.

1786
01:16:52,816 --> 01:16:53,650
[Eun-ji] Like this?

1787
01:16:53,734 --> 01:16:56,612
-[Han-na] I mean, what just happened?
-Oh, I'm going crazy, seriously.

1788
01:16:56,695 --> 01:16:58,780
-I mean, why did he lie down?
-[Han-na] I don't know.

1789
01:16:58,864 --> 01:17:00,532
-He needed to hide.
-I don't know.

1790
01:17:00,616 --> 01:17:01,867
"I need camouflage to hide!"

1791
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:04,036
Because it seems like
they're talking about it.

1792
01:17:04,119 --> 01:17:05,120
[Car] I can't be seen.

1793
01:17:05,203 --> 01:17:07,456
He instinctively thought,
"What should I do?" And hid.

1794
01:17:07,539 --> 01:17:08,582
But normally, you'd say,

1795
01:17:08,665 --> 01:17:11,001
-"I'll give you room to talk." And leave!
-Right.

1796
01:17:11,084 --> 01:17:12,544
He got overwhelmed.

1797
01:17:12,628 --> 01:17:15,088
He was too… flustered and just hid.

1798
01:17:15,631 --> 01:17:17,716
-[Ji-yeon] When did he? When?
-[Yeo-myung] What?

1799
01:17:17,799 --> 01:17:20,510
-Okay. So, Jae-yun just said that…
-[Ji-yeon] Mmm.

1800
01:17:21,094 --> 01:17:23,221
-…he was interested in me.
-Oh, right.

1801
01:17:23,305 --> 01:17:25,015
Even I knew about that. Yeah.

1802
01:17:25,098 --> 01:17:27,142
-[Yeo-myung] But then…
-[Ji-yeon] He changed it up?

1803
01:17:27,225 --> 01:17:30,771
[Yeo-myung] Suddenly, he told me
he wasn't actually into me.

1804
01:17:30,854 --> 01:17:34,566
He said he asked me
to go on a walk to explain that,

1805
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:37,277
but then also said he was into me?

1806
01:17:37,361 --> 01:17:40,030
-Really?
-So I felt that… Am I talking too loud?

1807
01:17:40,113 --> 01:17:42,658
-No. I mean, no. Go on.
-I mean, I was just so shocked.

1808
01:17:42,741 --> 01:17:45,285
-[Ji-yeon] Yeah, I get why. Suddenly?
-[Yeo-myung] I know, dude!

1809
01:17:45,369 --> 01:17:47,829
[Ji-yeon] How can he change his mind
in a few hours?

1810
01:17:47,913 --> 01:17:48,747
[Yeo-myung] Exactly.

1811
01:17:48,830 --> 01:17:51,833
So I asked, "So you're saying
you're not into me, right?"

1812
01:17:52,376 --> 01:17:53,794
And he said, "That is correct."

1813
01:17:53,877 --> 01:17:55,087
[laughs]

1814
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:56,672
-What is he saying?
-Exactly.

1815
01:17:56,755 --> 01:17:59,591
I was so blindsided by that conversation,

1816
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:02,552
I needed to tell
someone about it immediately.

1817
01:18:02,636 --> 01:18:04,262
And… and that was you.

1818
01:18:04,346 --> 01:18:05,305
[Ji-yeon laughs]

1819
01:18:05,889 --> 01:18:09,351
[Yeo-myung] I was just so taken aback.
I… I'm in total disbelief right now.

1820
01:18:09,434 --> 01:18:10,435
[Eun-ji gasps] Oh, no.

1821
01:18:10,519 --> 01:18:12,020
[somber music playing]

1822
01:18:12,104 --> 01:18:13,313
[both laughing hysterically]

1823
01:18:13,397 --> 01:18:14,773
[Ji-yeon] You're kidding, right?

1824
01:18:17,567 --> 01:18:18,777
[Jae-yun exhales]

1825
01:18:22,364 --> 01:18:23,365
[Eun-ji exclaims]

1826
01:18:41,007 --> 01:18:42,092
[sighs heavily]

1827
01:18:43,260 --> 01:18:46,179
-[Han-na] Oh, poor thing.
-[Eun-ji] Look at the dirt on his arm.

1828
01:18:47,305 --> 01:18:48,306
[Car] Wow.

1829
01:18:49,266 --> 01:18:51,143
[Eun-ji] Wow, this is…

1830
01:18:51,935 --> 01:18:53,812
Oh, I'm… I'm losing it. This is serious,

1831
01:18:53,895 --> 01:18:56,022
-but I kind of want to laugh.
-[Car] Yeah.

1832
01:18:56,106 --> 01:19:00,444
-I wanna laugh, but then I feel bad again.
-Exactly. The fifth night has been crazy.

1833
01:19:00,527 --> 01:19:03,321
Seriously. The sad love stories
we see in dramas

1834
01:19:03,405 --> 01:19:06,283
-actually do happen in real life.
-Those scenes that make you think…

1835
01:19:06,366 --> 01:19:07,868
-Yeah.
-"This can't be real."

1836
01:19:07,951 --> 01:19:09,619
That scene was basically High Kick!

1837
01:19:09,703 --> 01:19:12,497
This kind of thing is only possible
on Better Late Than Single.

1838
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:15,208
But Yeo-myung
really must've been taken aback.

1839
01:19:15,292 --> 01:19:18,003
-Jae-yun must be thinking she's…
-[Han-na] Yeah.

1840
01:19:18,086 --> 01:19:23,008
…probably uncomfortable
or maybe she's avoiding spending time

1841
01:19:23,091 --> 01:19:27,888
with other individuals
because he causes her discomfort.

1842
01:19:28,472 --> 01:19:30,891
It's possible he could have felt that way.

1843
01:19:30,974 --> 01:19:32,684
-[Han-na sighs]
-[In-guk] He did say,

1844
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:35,145
"My feelings are at five,
but I said they were at 100."

1845
01:19:35,228 --> 01:19:36,480
-"I exaggerated."
-[Car] Right.

1846
01:19:36,563 --> 01:19:37,773
He really wanted to say,

1847
01:19:37,856 --> 01:19:40,108
"Please don't be uncomfortable and…

1848
01:19:40,192 --> 01:19:42,319
-Mmm.
-…don't feel pressured by me."

1849
01:19:42,402 --> 01:19:45,489
I thought so too,
but now he's a watchman in the bushes.

1850
01:19:46,114 --> 01:19:50,118
I… [chuckles] I think after this disaster,
Jae-yun will be so upset.

1851
01:19:50,202 --> 01:19:52,162
-[Han-na] Yeah.
-I'm certain about it.

1852
01:19:52,245 --> 01:19:55,874
I really think Jae-yun will be
so incredibly hurt and disappointed.

1853
01:19:55,957 --> 01:19:56,833
[In-guk] Mm-hmm.

1854
01:19:56,917 --> 01:19:58,168
That's true. This is…

1855
01:19:58,251 --> 01:20:00,003
He's the type to blame himself a lot.

1856
01:20:00,086 --> 01:20:03,590
I don't think anything went as planned.
What he said, and this situation here…

1857
01:20:03,673 --> 01:20:05,008
[Eun-ji] He'll blame himself.

1858
01:20:05,759 --> 01:20:07,677
-[contestants] Cheers!
-[Sang-ho] Oh, like…

1859
01:20:07,761 --> 01:20:09,971
-[Yeo-myung] Really? That's crazy.
-It's almost gone.

1860
01:20:11,014 --> 01:20:12,599
[quirky music playing]

1861
01:20:12,682 --> 01:20:13,892
[Jeong-mok] You can drink!

1862
01:20:14,392 --> 01:20:15,477
[Min-hong] Am I a bit red?

1863
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:17,395
-[Seung-li] Yeah.
-Stop taking little sips.

1864
01:20:18,563 --> 01:20:19,648
[gulps, exhales]

1865
01:20:19,731 --> 01:20:21,525
You… you should stop drinking.

1866
01:20:21,608 --> 01:20:22,734
When I was young,

1867
01:20:22,818 --> 01:20:25,904
I really thought I'd grow up
to be like a cool, soju drinking adult.

1868
01:20:25,987 --> 01:20:28,865
I'm so cool right now. I drank a lot.

1869
01:20:28,949 --> 01:20:30,075
[Yeo-myung] I can tell.

1870
01:20:31,993 --> 01:20:33,036
[Ji-yeon] I'm cool.

1871
01:20:34,538 --> 01:20:35,789
[Jeong-mok] True. Time for bed?

1872
01:20:35,872 --> 01:20:39,209
-We promised to go on a hamburger date.
-Oh, that's right. I am…

1873
01:20:39,292 --> 01:20:40,919
-I like both.
-I'm team Burger King.

1874
01:20:41,002 --> 01:20:42,671
-What?
-[Ji-yeon] Burger King?

1875
01:20:42,754 --> 01:20:44,589
[Sang-ho] Right, me too.
That's really cool.

1876
01:20:44,673 --> 01:20:45,507
[Car] Oh!

1877
01:20:47,092 --> 01:20:49,094
-[sighs]
-[mellow music playing]

1878
01:20:51,221 --> 01:20:52,055
[Car] Oh!

1879
01:20:52,138 --> 01:20:53,515
[Ji-yeon] Whatever, dude.

1880
01:20:53,598 --> 01:20:55,433
Wait. Jeong-mok seems weird.

1881
01:20:55,517 --> 01:20:57,727
-What?
-[Han-na] Look at Jeong-mok's face.

1882
01:21:00,105 --> 01:21:01,565
[laughter]

1883
01:21:03,024 --> 01:21:05,151
-What?
-Nothing. She can really drink.

1884
01:21:05,986 --> 01:21:07,237
No, drink up. Drink up.

1885
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:10,782
[Ji-yeon] I don't know. Let's drink.
I need to drink my anger away.

1886
01:21:11,408 --> 01:21:13,952
I'm drinking the night away! [chuckles]

1887
01:21:14,494 --> 01:21:15,620
I can't get up.

1888
01:21:15,704 --> 01:21:17,289
[Sang-ho] That… That's a big problem.

1889
01:21:17,372 --> 01:21:18,540
Okay.

1890
01:21:19,583 --> 01:21:20,417
[Eun-ji exclaims]

1891
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:22,669
-[Han-na] Wait. Hold on.
-Does he like Ji-yeon?

1892
01:21:23,253 --> 01:21:25,463
Oh, someone save me.

1893
01:21:25,547 --> 01:21:28,800
-Wait, what is this? Yeah.
-[Han-na] Look at this…Okay, so at first,

1894
01:21:28,884 --> 01:21:30,468
-they were just friends.
-[In-guk] Yeah.

1895
01:21:30,552 --> 01:21:31,761
They were really just friends.

1896
01:21:31,845 --> 01:21:34,306
Next, he thought,
"Hold on. She's actually cool."

1897
01:21:34,389 --> 01:21:35,557
Ji-yeon is really selfless.

1898
01:21:35,640 --> 01:21:37,183
She takes care of others.

1899
01:21:37,267 --> 01:21:38,602
Jeong-mok does that too.

1900
01:21:38,685 --> 01:21:41,646
And as they're enjoying soju,
he's starting to think,

1901
01:21:41,730 --> 01:21:43,732
-"Wait. I didn't know…
-Yeah.

1902
01:21:43,815 --> 01:21:45,483
-…this side of her."
-[Car] Ah.

1903
01:21:46,026 --> 01:21:48,236
-I think you're right.
-[Han-na] This is a problem.

1904
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,739
I really like watching
stuff like this in person.

1905
01:21:50,822 --> 01:21:53,408
-From Sang-ho's perspective and stuff.
-Oh, right in front?

1906
01:21:53,491 --> 01:21:55,493
-[laughter]
-[Han-na] From Sang-ho's seat.

1907
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:56,661
[laughing]

1908
01:21:56,745 --> 01:21:57,829
[Eun-ji exclaims]

1909
01:21:57,913 --> 01:21:59,915
-[Han-na] Both of them? Like this?
-[Car exclaims]

1910
01:21:59,998 --> 01:22:02,292
-[tense music playing]
-[chuckles softly]

1911
01:22:02,375 --> 01:22:04,294
-You should carry her back.
-[Ji-yeon chuckles]

1912
01:22:04,377 --> 01:22:05,670
Can you carry me?

1913
01:22:05,754 --> 01:22:07,088
-[chuckles]
-[Do scoffs]

1914
01:22:07,172 --> 01:22:08,506
[Ji-yeon chuckles]

1915
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:12,510
But Ji-yeon needs to see his face
from a more objective perspective.

1916
01:22:12,594 --> 01:22:13,970
[Ji-yeon and Yeo-myung laugh]

1917
01:22:14,054 --> 01:22:16,640
It's just hard to keep a poker face today.

1918
01:22:17,474 --> 01:22:18,975
[Ji-yeon] I'm not letting you go.

1919
01:22:21,645 --> 01:22:23,188
You spilled on everything.

1920
01:22:23,897 --> 01:22:25,523
-Huh?
-It's all over your clothes, silly.

1921
01:22:25,607 --> 01:22:26,983
-Really?
-[Jeong-mok] It's nothing.

1922
01:22:27,067 --> 01:22:27,901
It's okay.

1923
01:22:27,984 --> 01:22:29,611
I won't wear it after today anyway.

1924
01:22:31,321 --> 01:22:32,280
[sighs]

1925
01:22:33,156 --> 01:22:34,157
[music fades]

1926
01:22:35,700 --> 01:22:38,620
Oh, I'll bring you a tangerine.
Let's go too if we're done drinking.

1927
01:22:38,703 --> 01:22:40,580
[Ji-yeon] Wait. Bring me one.

1928
01:22:41,331 --> 01:22:42,457
[Jeong-mok] Wait here. What?

1929
01:22:42,540 --> 01:22:44,000
Huh? Wait right here, please.

1930
01:22:44,084 --> 01:22:45,251
What is he doing?

1931
01:22:45,335 --> 01:22:47,003
-[Ji-yeon] I'm getting a tangerine.
-What?

1932
01:22:47,087 --> 01:22:49,965
-I can't believe they're doing this to Do.
-[Han-na] Poor Do, how awful.

1933
01:22:50,048 --> 01:22:51,800
[tense music playing]

1934
01:22:51,883 --> 01:22:52,801
[scoffs]

1935
01:22:54,135 --> 01:22:55,178
Wow.

1936
01:22:56,221 --> 01:22:58,848
Does he think he's a saint, or what?

1937
01:23:01,476 --> 01:23:02,310
[sighs]

1938
01:23:06,022 --> 01:23:06,940
[clicks tongue]

1939
01:23:13,071 --> 01:23:13,989
[sighs]

1940
01:23:21,538 --> 01:23:22,372
[Do shouts]

1941
01:23:24,582 --> 01:23:25,417
[scoffs]

1942
01:23:25,917 --> 01:23:27,585
[Do] To be completely honest,

1943
01:23:28,211 --> 01:23:29,629
my pride was hurt,

1944
01:23:29,713 --> 01:23:33,550
but I felt putting my ego aside
was the best thing I could do.

1945
01:23:34,092 --> 01:23:35,552
[insects trilling]

1946
01:23:37,929 --> 01:23:38,805
[huffs]

1947
01:23:39,764 --> 01:23:42,517
-But you know, that's better.
-Yeah, I want to try it too.

1948
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:44,436
-That is a lot better.
-[Sang-ho] I agree.

1949
01:23:44,519 --> 01:23:46,730
-I wanna try it too.
-You got makeup on your nose.

1950
01:23:46,813 --> 01:23:47,814
-What?
-Take some tissues.

1951
01:23:47,897 --> 01:23:49,482
When are you heading back, Ji-yeon?

1952
01:23:50,233 --> 01:23:53,028
-[Ji-yeon] After I finish all of this.
-[Do] Until what time tonight?

1953
01:23:53,111 --> 01:23:53,945
I don't know.

1954
01:23:54,029 --> 01:23:55,655
-I need to have the honey shot.
-Okay.

1955
01:23:55,739 --> 01:23:56,781
[Ji-yeon chuckles] Yeah!

1956
01:23:57,282 --> 01:23:58,742
Oh, but this is really the original.

1957
01:23:58,825 --> 01:24:01,494
Oh, she's uncomfortable
with Ji-yeon being here.

1958
01:24:01,578 --> 01:24:02,746
She's bothered by it.

1959
01:24:02,829 --> 01:24:05,040
-I need to vent.
-[Min-hong] But you can slow down, no?

1960
01:24:05,123 --> 01:24:06,791
-Going to bed?
-[Ji-yeon] I'm not ready!

1961
01:24:06,875 --> 01:24:08,293
Sleeping sounds nice though.

1962
01:24:08,376 --> 01:24:09,669
-Come on.
-I'll head back first.

1963
01:24:09,753 --> 01:24:12,464
We need to rest up
and be ready for tomorrow's activities.

1964
01:24:14,299 --> 01:24:16,384
-You coming?
-[Min-hong] We're going together, silly!

1965
01:24:16,468 --> 01:24:18,470
-And you?
-[Car] She's not going.

1966
01:24:18,553 --> 01:24:20,847
-She's not, she's not!
-[Ji-yeon] One more!

1967
01:24:22,265 --> 01:24:24,434
-Just… Gosh. Just try it.
-Good night, everyone!

1968
01:24:24,517 --> 01:24:26,686
[Seung-chan] I'll set the alarm first
and then wash up.

1969
01:24:29,397 --> 01:24:30,482
[indistinct chatter]

1970
01:24:32,901 --> 01:24:34,486
[chuckles drily]

1971
01:24:34,569 --> 01:24:38,406
See you later, Ji-yeon. Get back safely.
Don't pass out here, okay?

1972
01:24:38,490 --> 01:24:40,033
I'll be back soon.

1973
01:24:40,116 --> 01:24:42,160
[Jeong-mok] Oh,
I'm suddenly getting tipsy.

1974
01:24:42,827 --> 01:24:44,162
[Do] Did you drink a lot?

1975
01:24:44,245 --> 01:24:45,455
No, I didn't drink much.

1976
01:24:45,538 --> 01:24:48,666
-I had… three or four shots.
-But you said you had a headache.

1977
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:50,794
Is it really okay
for you to drink right now?

1978
01:24:51,753 --> 01:24:54,255
I just drank. I mean,
when else will I get to drink?

1979
01:24:54,339 --> 01:24:55,173
Right.

1980
01:24:55,256 --> 01:24:57,050
But why is Ji-yeon…

1981
01:24:57,634 --> 01:25:00,345
[Jeong-mok] Is she okay?
I'm sure she's fine.

1982
01:25:00,970 --> 01:25:02,764
[Do] You're right. Yeah.

1983
01:25:04,099 --> 01:25:04,974
Bye.

1984
01:25:06,601 --> 01:25:07,852
I came to walk you back.

1985
01:25:08,436 --> 01:25:10,772
-Oh, really? You're not heading in?
-Yeah. No.

1986
01:25:10,855 --> 01:25:13,149
-Oh, you're drinking more?
-Yeah, a little.

1987
01:25:13,233 --> 01:25:15,110
-[Do] Mmm.
-[tense music playing]

1988
01:25:15,193 --> 01:25:17,779
[Eun-ji] Wow, these two
feel so different from earlier today.

1989
01:25:17,862 --> 01:25:20,740
[Han-na] Totally. They were basically
a couple just this afternoon.

1990
01:25:20,824 --> 01:25:23,118
[Car] The vibe's
totally different now though.

1991
01:25:24,619 --> 01:25:26,412
[Do] Thanks for walking me back.

1992
01:25:26,996 --> 01:25:28,456
-Sleep well.
-Good night.

1993
01:25:35,171 --> 01:25:36,172
[sighs]

1994
01:25:38,466 --> 01:25:39,467

Jeong-mok.

1997
01:25:53,690 --> 01:25:54,524
Yeah?

1998
01:25:57,026 --> 01:25:58,403
Can we talk for a second?

1999
01:25:59,445 --> 01:26:01,072
-Are you too tired?
-No, no.

2002
01:26:10,832 --> 01:26:12,208
[door lock beeps]

2003
01:26:12,292 --> 01:26:13,293
[Eun-ji] Is someone here?

2004
01:26:13,793 --> 01:26:15,920
-Wait, what? You scared me.
-[Jeong-mok chuckles]

2005
01:26:16,004 --> 01:26:16,838
My bag.

2006
01:26:17,547 --> 01:26:18,756
Why are you here?

2007
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:19,966
To talk for a second.

2008
01:26:24,429 --> 01:26:25,597
-[Do] What?
-[Jeong-mok] Hmm.

2009
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:27,724
-Who is it this time?
-I came to get my bag.

2010
01:26:27,807 --> 01:26:30,518
[Do] Oh! Ji-yeon!
Are you done for the night?

2011
01:26:30,602 --> 01:26:33,021
No, um. I'm going back to the Lounge.

2012
01:26:33,104 --> 01:26:34,606
Oh, really? Okay.

[door closes]

2014
01:26:42,071 --> 01:26:43,531
I'm worried she might fall over.

2015
01:26:43,615 --> 01:26:44,741
[Do] Mmm.

2016
01:26:44,824 --> 01:26:45,825
She's stumbling.

2017
01:26:48,870 --> 01:26:50,079
Uh…

2018
01:26:57,545 --> 01:26:58,755
Hmm.

2019
01:26:59,255 --> 01:27:01,216
-Are you…
-Yeah?

2020
01:27:05,803 --> 01:27:06,888
Am I…

2021
01:27:10,350 --> 01:27:11,184
Hmm.

2022
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:13,186
What's wrong?

2023
01:27:13,269 --> 01:27:14,312
-[chuckles softly]
-Huh?

2024
01:27:14,395 --> 01:27:16,773
I'm thinking of how to phrase it.

2025
01:27:16,856 --> 01:27:19,692
-Right.
-Yeah, one second. [sniffles]

2026
01:27:19,776 --> 01:27:21,110
Yes, let's do that.

2027
01:27:21,194 --> 01:27:23,196
-Is the…
-Mm-hmm?

2028
01:27:24,072 --> 01:27:25,990
-…person your heart is drawn to…
-Mm-hmm.

[Jeong-mok] Hmm…

2032
01:27:30,828 --> 01:27:32,789
What exactly do you mean?

2033
01:27:32,872 --> 01:27:33,831
[Do] Hmm?

2034
01:27:33,915 --> 01:27:35,750
[low suspenseful music playing]

2035
01:27:35,833 --> 01:27:38,378
When you ask that,

2036
01:27:38,461 --> 01:27:39,921
-are you asking…
-Huh?

2037
01:27:40,004 --> 01:27:41,839
…whether I happen to like Ji-yeon?

2038
01:27:41,923 --> 01:27:43,216
Yeah, that's right.

2039
01:27:43,758 --> 01:27:44,592
