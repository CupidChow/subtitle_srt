IS IT HARD TO MAKE EYE CONTACT?

12
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:38,538
Yes, so I guess I have some trouble
with, um, eye contact,

13
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:44,919
so I'm sort of
in the habit of just looking down.

14

[staff 2] Can you put your hands
on the table?

Well…

20
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:06,775
Probably that I'm your average dumb guy.

22
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:16,409
It's like…
I think I have pretty decent hardware,

23

are about to come together.

62
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:53,131
[woman 1] When we were making eye contact,
I started feeling kind of shy.

63
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:54,299
[woman 2] What should I do?

64
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:56,467
[woman 3] I thought he would hold my hand.

65
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:59,596
[man 1] I must still be my old self
'cause I can't do this.

66
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,639
[woman 2] Shouldn't he do this for me?

67
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:04,142
-[man 2] It's my first time.
-[man 3] I was too frazzled.

69
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:07,979
Whoops.

It was the first and bravest attempt
I've made in my whole life.

74
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:23,870
-[woman 1] It's my first too.
-[man 1] I never felt this way.

75
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:26,039
-[man 4] Butterflies?
-[woman 1] I'm so nervous.

76
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:28,499
But can you do that
when you're not dating?

77
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:31,169
[woman 5] I would, of course.
This is what flirting is.

78
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:33,129
You're it. For me.

79
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:34,881
-I love you.
-[man 1] You're pretty.

80

81
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,425
[man 4] Give me a chance?

82
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:39,719
[woman 2] Hey! I'm popular too, you know.

83

I'm so pissed right now.

85
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:46,017
-[man 4] I'm already screwed.
-[man 3] Why?

86
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,561
[man 1] You might find this crazy,
but I was thinking,

"I might marry this girl."

have lived their whole lives
without going on a date.

108

Just hearing the words
"first love" or "first relationship"

109
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:42,573
-makes our heart flutter, doesn't it?
-[Eun-ji] Absolutely.

110

Aren't we basically
the first show in Korea

111

so they'll be better at dating?

112
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:51,332

-We provided a speech coach…
-[Eun-ji] Right.

114

00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:04,137
-I have.
-Yes.

119
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,431
-I thought he was lying.
-[Han-na] Oh!

120
00:05:06,514 --> 00:05:10,893
Because when we first met,
he looked so handsome that I was like,

121
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:14,397
"What? He's never dated before?"

122
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,898
But after a bit, I got like…

123
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:18,151
-I was like, "Oh, that's why. Okay."
-[Han-na] I see.

124
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:19,485
"That makes sense now."

I personally feel like I'm their mentor,

00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:41,544
Would you say you care for other people
more than yourself?

173
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:45,214
Like Shinji Ikari in Evangelion?

174
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,341
I've never seen Evangelion,
so I'm not sure.

175
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:51,220
Or kinda like the main character
from Bungo Stray Dogs?

176
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:54,098
Bungo… What is that?
Is that also an anime?

177
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,850
-Yep.
-[quirky music playing]

178
00:07:55,933 --> 00:08:00,396
In the anime, The Seven Deadly Sins,
pride is the strongest.

179
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,440
Like Luffy's Gear 5.

180
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:03,774
His… his name is Escanor.

181
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,276
[manager] Pride's the strongest?

182
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:07,278
[Jae-yun] At noon,
he becomes the strongest.

183
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:08,654
Please stop it.

184
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,781
-I have no clue what he's talking about.
-[laughter]

185
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:12,909
Jae-yun really likes anime, huh?

186
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,786
What do women think of that?

187
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,663
[colleague] It's hard to approach him

188
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:20,666
-because he seems to be in his own world.
-[manager] Right.

189
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,503
Oh, no.

190
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,254
Bring him out.

191
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:28,758
I'd like to have a chat with him.

192
00:08:29,425 --> 00:08:30,635
MEETING HIS CUPID

193
00:08:30,718 --> 00:08:32,762
-So great to meet you. I'm Seo In-guk.
-Hello.

194
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:35,389
-Hello. Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

195
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:38,017
-You're so handsome.
-[softly] No, sir, I'm not.

196
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,477
-Hey, this is casual.
-Okay.

197
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,229
You can call me In-guk.

198
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:42,897
-Right.
-Okay?

199
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:45,858
-Okay, In-guk.
-[In-guk laughs]

200
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:48,611
I saw the video. So you've never dated.

201
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:49,529
Right.

202
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:50,988
I have a question.

203
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:53,824
Have you ever felt a spark with anyone?

204
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:55,618
Like a crush?

205
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:58,162
-In high school.
-Okay.

206
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,456
-Summer Bible camp…
-Uh-huh.

207
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:03,793
I once held the hand of a girl I liked.

208
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,962
You held her hand? How?

209
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:09,090
-How'd that happen?
-Yeah. I gently grabbed it.

210
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:11,676
-You gently… Do it to me.
-Well, maybe it wasn't gentle.

211
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:12,593
Show me.

212
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:14,303
It was like this?

213
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:18,474
Well, like, when we were all in a circle…

214
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,226
-In a circle?
-…holding hands and praying…

215
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,353
Oh.

216
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,939
So holding hands while praying?

217
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:26,107
[hesitates] Yes.

218
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,192
-Oh.
-[quirky music playing]

219
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:31,654
I want to be comfortable talking to--

220
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:32,697
[In-guk] Okay.

221
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,825
-And I wanna come across as sincere.
-Okay.

222
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:36,742
Sure.

223
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,537
-That's my goal.
-Sure.

224
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:42,582
You know, I think
trying to speak louder for a start

225
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,333
could be part of your training.

226
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,585
What do you think?

227
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:47,795
Yeah, you're right.

228
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:50,548
You said,
"I'd like to speak more confidently."

229
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:51,465
COMMUNICATION COACH

230
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:54,969
So, when we're talking,
I want you to think of this as practice.

231
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:56,429
[vocalizing] Ah.

232
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:57,972
Ah.

233
00:09:58,055 --> 00:09:59,098
Ah.

234
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:00,182
Ah.

235
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,809
-[abruptly] Ah!
-Ah!

236
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:03,102
Oh. Oh.

237
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:05,896
-Hello. I'm Noh Jae-yun.
-[upbeat music playing]

238
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,315
I'm Noh Jae-yun.

239
00:10:07,398 --> 00:10:08,232
[coach] Good.

240
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:10,109
"Hello. I'm Noh Jae-yun."

241
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:12,361
"With my new confident voice…"

242
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,280
"…I can achieve my dreams."

243
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,533
"I can love deeply and passionately."

244
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:21,245
I don't spend a lot of time
going out and socializing,

245
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,914
so it's really hard for me
to talk to people.

246
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:28,210
I'd like to feel more proud of myself

247
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:32,548
and get used to talking to people

248
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,842
so I can start a relationship.

249
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:36,677
[music fades]

250
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,763
[bright music playing]

251
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:42,642
I'm really curious
to see Jae-yun's transformation.

252
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:54,612
-[Cupids] Wow!
-[Han-na] There we go!

253
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:56,656
-[Car] Damn!
-[Eun-ji] He's so handsome!

254
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,157
-Wow!
-[Eun-ji] Oh, my God!

255
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,409
-[Han-na] He has such a sweet face.
-[Car] He's hot!

256
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,453
Oh, my God, I got goosebumps.

257
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,082
[bright music continues]

258
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:14,674
Hi. I'm a 27-year-old
eternal single, Noh Jae-yun.

259
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:16,008
NOH JAE-YUN
NO LONGER ADORKABLE

260
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,052
[Eun-ji] My gosh, this boy!
He's so handsome now.

261
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:19,261
ANY EXPECTATIONS?

262
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:22,264
I'm excited to see how well I do
after my makeover.

263
00:11:22,807 --> 00:11:24,266
ANY CONCERNS?

264
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:30,022
But I'm a little worried
that I might be even less appealing.

265
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:33,818
On the first date,
I don't think I can hold hands.

266
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:36,195
But just touching fingers might be okay.

267
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:38,864
Just the tips.

268
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:43,077
Kinda like this.

269
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:45,663
To my future girlfriend,

270
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:48,833
I might be lacking
in a few ways right now,

271
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:52,920
but I'll keep trying
to become a better man.

272
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,048
Yoroshiku.

273
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,716
[staff chuckling]

274
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,553
-"Yoroshiku"?
-[Eun-ji] He's making jokes now?

275
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:01,929
I'm excited to meet you.

276
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:03,264
[whimsical music playing]

277
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:05,015
Wow. He's a changed man.

278
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,684
He's become a bit more confident.

279
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:08,978
-Lots of hand gestures while talking.
-[Han-na] Exactly.

280
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,771
I think he's definitely changed.

281
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:13,274
-He looks nicer now that he's smiling.
-You're right.

282
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:15,609
I finally got to see
Jae-yun's front teeth.

283
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:16,610
[laughter]

284
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:17,695
I didn't even see them.

285
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:19,947
[Eun-ji] I was so curious
about those teeth.

286
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,575
[mellow music playing]

287
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:29,915
[Eun-ji] Who could that be?

288
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:38,674
[music turns captivating]

289
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:40,092
Look who it is!

290
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,428
-Oh, I was her mentor.
-[In-guk] Is that Park Bo-young?

291
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:44,680
-Doesn't she look beautiful?
-So pretty.

292
00:12:44,763 --> 00:12:45,806
Wow.

293
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:48,392
She doesn't seem like
she's been single since birth.

294
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:49,310
[In-guk] Wait.

295
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:51,395
[captivating music continues]

296
00:12:56,650 --> 00:13:01,197
Hey there. I'm a 26-year-old
eternal single, Kang Ji-su.

297
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,448
[chuckles]

298
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:04,158
-[Car] She's so pretty.
-[Eun-ji] Oh, my!

299
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:05,284
TRULY AN ETERNAL SINGLE?

300
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:06,535
Yes. [chuckles]

301
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:08,871
That's right.

302
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,916
Actually, I've never even had a crush.

303
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,501
Do I get butterflies?

304
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:16,921
Not really. I think I'm just kind of
closed off when I meet guys.

305
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:19,173
But I'm not like that with girls.

306
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,801
In middle school,
boys and girls were in separate classes.

307
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:26,263
And then in high school,
we had 40 girls and five boys.

308
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,182
And I went to a women's university.

309
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:30,726
So I'm just uncomfortable
with men. [chuckles]

310
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,770
INTERVIEW WITH PRODUCERS

311
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:36,899
I've been on about four blind dates.
Five? Four? Around there.

312
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:40,653
I was so nervous. When I was eating,
my spoon was shaking like this.

313
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:43,572
But it wasn't because
I had butterflies in my stomach.

314
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:46,408
I was just thinking,
"Would saying this be offensive?"

315
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,993
"Is this a rude thing to say?"

316
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,453
It was exhausting.

317
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:52,498
When we're just
messaging each other, it's fun.

318
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,668
But when I have to go out to meet him,

319
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:58,420
from about two days before,
I feel so anxious.

320
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,339
"The… the date is approaching."

321
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:03,676
So I'd rather just stay at home on my own.

322
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:05,135
[whimsical music playing]

323
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:08,389
When I go out, it really drains my energy.

324
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:11,684
I think that means I'm more of a homebody.

325
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:13,227
-[Car] I see.
-[In-guk] I understand.

326
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:15,187
[Ji-su] Once, I stayed home
for over a month.

327
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,855
I was barely talking to anyone,

328
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:19,608
so it felt like
I was forgetting how to speak.

329
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:23,696
And then I thought, "Uh-oh, at this rate,
I really won't be able to get married."

330
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:25,823
That's why I signed up
and came here. [chuckles]

331
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:26,991
[pleasant music playing]

332
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:28,742
You like staying in, huh?

333
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:30,327
I'm kind of a homebody too.

334
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:33,038
-I'm the same way.
-Isn't it so nice?

335
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:37,084
But I do think it's important to go out
and meet new people.

336
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:38,586
-Yeah, you're right.
-Right?

337
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:40,629
I think this is great timing.

338
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:41,630
Outside of this,

339
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:46,051
you won't have another reason to stay out
of the house for this long, right?

340
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,345
-Not for another three years.
-Exactly.

341
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:52,141
And since you wouldn't otherwise
leave your house again for three years,

342
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,184
I want you to think to yourself,

343
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:56,854
"I'm experiencing something new,"
and just enjoy it.

344
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:58,063
That sounds great.

345
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:00,024
MEETING WITH EXPERTS

346
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,525
If you're walking down the street

347
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:04,153
and you see a doll you really want
from the claw machine…

348
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,195
KIM JI-YONG
PSYCHIATRIST

349
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,405
…what should you do?

350
00:15:06,989 --> 00:15:09,325
-I play until I get it.
-You keep playing.

351
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,451
[chuckles]

352
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:13,120
'Cause if you don't,
you won't get anything.

353
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:14,914
You need to try.

354
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:17,291
You need to build up
the courage to get hurt.

355
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:21,086
I think this is a really good opportunity.

356
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:24,006
I want to have natural,
comfortable relationships.

357
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,008
I'm ready to go out and flirt.

358
00:15:26,091 --> 00:15:28,552
I'm flirting with you
right now. [chuckles]

359
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,472
I'm hitting on you right now.

360
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,475
I'll do my best. [chuckles]

361
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:38,103
-[Eun-ji] Oh, she's so cute. Wow!
-[Han-na] She's such a cutie.

362
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,605
KANG JI-SU
THE BRAVE HOMEBODY

363
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:41,482
Just keep that energy up.

364
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:44,193
[upbeat rock music playing]

365
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:48,948
-[In-guk] Wow, that bod!
-[Cupids exclaiming]

366
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:53,994
[Cupids exclaiming]

367
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:56,538
-Oh, this guy. I know him.
-[Eun-ji] Now, that's a big wow!

368
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,999
-[Han-na] He kind of has a macho vibe.
-Oh!

369
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:05,005
Hello. I'm a 27-year-old
eternal single, Kim Seung-li.

370
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:09,385
I left seven years ago in 2017.

371
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,887
I went to school at Mackenzie.

372
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,182
I lived in Brazil for about 12 years.

373
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:17,226
I didn't fit in there at all.

374
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:19,812
I was severely bullied.

375
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:21,897
I couldn't speak Portuguese at first,

376
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:25,818
so I didn't really talk to people
because I felt embarrassed.

377
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:27,111
[solemn music playing]

378
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:29,113
Back then, I was really fat.

379
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,574
I weighed around 90… 100 kilos.

380
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:34,952
My face was this big, so I lost weight.

381
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,370
[upbeat music playing]

382
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:38,706
I decided, "I have to exercise."

383
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,791
-I think I've gained confidence.
-[Eun-ji whoops]

384
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,251
[Seung-li] I exercise every day.

385
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:45,129
And I think I've come to like my body.

386
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:48,716
I played soccer in Brazil
when I was a kid.

387
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:52,386
So I think
I'm a bit better at it than most people.

388
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,347
Brazilians are very open-minded.

389
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:58,809
In high school, girls would
come up to me and jokingly say,

390
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:01,645
"Do you want to kiss?" all the time.
All kinds of girls.

391
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,105
So I… I drew a line.

392
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:06,025
I was a bit more conservative
than Brazilians.

393
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,735
KIM SEUNG-LI
TRADITIONAL GUY FROM BRAZIL

394
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:10,404
[Car] Okay, he's more conservative
than you'd think.

395
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:11,321
MEETING HIS CUPID

396
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,282
You don't know who's going
for the same person.

397
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,909
-Right. Could be many people.
-So what will you do about them?

398
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,453
TEACHING HIM
HOW TO GET RID OF RIVALS

399
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,204
What do you normally do?

400
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:22,416
You fight with emotions, right?
You just attack him.

401
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:23,751
Attack him?

402
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:25,419
Like, discreetly stomp on his foot.

403
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:27,546
He'll go, "Ow!" The next day…

404
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:29,757
-What? Why?
-…he'll be like this.

405
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,924
[all laughing]

406
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,217
Wait, hold on…

407
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,178
-Violence?
-[laughing]

408
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:36,305
You're a celebrity promoting violence.

409
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,182
Yeah, that's how you
deal with your rivals.

410
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:39,099
[Cupids exclaim]

411
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:42,102
Don't bother fighting with emotions.
Just attack them.

412
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:43,437
[laughter]

413
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,606
I was just telling him
he could win by force.

414
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:47,066
[Han-na] To beat his rival?

415
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,525
-[Car] Yeah.
-[laughs]

416
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:51,111
[pleasant music playing]

417
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:54,490
THE FIRST MEETING SPOT

418
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:57,451
-Hello.
-Nice to meet you.

419
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:59,119
-[In-guk] They've met.
-[Eun-ji] Really?

420
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:00,162
-[Car] Yeah.
-Hello.

421
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:04,083
Hello.

422
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,793
-Hi.
-[Jae-yun] Nice to meet you.

423
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:08,796
[quirky music playing]

424
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:15,135
Okay, someone needs to start talking.

425
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:16,470
It's suffocating.

426
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,472
Oof, weird vibe.

427
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:22,684
[chuckles]

428
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:24,645
Uh, what's your name?

429
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:27,689
-I'm Kim Seung-li.
-Hi, Kim Seung-li.

430
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:28,982
-[In-guk] Whoa!
-[Eun-ji] What?

431
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:31,443
[Car] Jae-yun started the conversation.
My guy!

432
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:35,114
[Eun-ji] Whoa. Look at him, you guys.
In-guk is so moved now.

433
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,698
Kim Seung-gi. What's your--

434
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,659
Oh, I'm Kang Ji-su.

435
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:41,036
Ji-su. I'm Noh Jae-yun.

436
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,288
-[both] Noh Jae-yun?
-[Jae-yun] Yep. Yun.

437
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:46,708
How… how are you all feeling?

438
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:50,838
Pretty good, I guess.
But the weather is a little gloomy.

439
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,423
It's still nice though.

440
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:55,175
Glad to be here.

441
00:18:58,011 --> 00:18:59,888
Was your luggage heavy?

442
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:03,100
-It really was. My arms are falling off.
-Mine too. Very heavy.

443
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:04,560
Was yours heavy?

444
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,478
Yeah, I brought lots of clothes.

445
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:16,280
[quirky music playing]

446
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:17,865
[grunts, sighs]

447
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,496
They've run out of things to say.

448
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:29,126
-[chuckles] Is it okay that I'm so quiet?
-[Jae-yun] Yeah.

449
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:31,295
-Well, I mean, do we have to talk?
-Do we…

450
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:35,799
Would… would you say you're an introvert?

451
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:38,302
Yeah, I'm definitely an introvert.

452
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:41,680
I'm an INTP, like, 97% of the time,

453
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:43,140
-[Seung-li] Oh.
-Oh.

454
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,143
I heard that most people
who've never dated

455
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:47,811
-are INTPs.
-Oh, really?

456
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:50,147
Are you shy?

457
00:19:51,106 --> 00:19:52,983
-Yeah. [chuckles]
-[Seung-li] You are?

458
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:55,360
-[Ji-su] You're not, Seung-li?
-No, I am too.

459
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:56,820
-[Ji-su] Oh, you are?
-Oh, yeah.

460
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:59,364
Hey, take off your shirt or something.

461
00:19:59,448 --> 00:20:00,365
[Eun-ji laughs]

462
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:04,203
-Of course. Take it off. Do something.
-Show them what you got.

463
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:07,289
-What are you talking about?
-[Eun-ji] Someone give them a beer.

464
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:09,374
[pleasant music playing]

465
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,876
[woman] Oh, I'm nervous.

466
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:15,714
[Eun-ji] Oh, wow!

467
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:18,091
[Han-na] She's so pretty.

468
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:25,390
Hey, everyone. I'm a 26-year-old
eternal single, Kim Yeo-myung.

469
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,436
-Aw, her smile is so pretty.
-[Eun-ji] Oh, wow! So pretty.

470
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:31,772
Okay, so we have another beauty.

471
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:33,899
-Isn't she so lovely?
-[Eun-ji] She is.

472
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:38,070
So I've never
really been interested in dating.

473
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:41,073
Uh, many of my friends
have also never dated.

474
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:45,202
And we were all just like,
"Birds of a feather flock together."

475
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:47,454
But then we all turned 26,

476
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:49,414
uh, they all got boyfriends.

477
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,875
Suddenly, I had no one to hang out with.

478
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:54,253
And I felt really jealous.

479
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:57,214
I was like,
"I want a boyfriend too." [chuckles]

480
00:20:57,297 --> 00:21:00,509
I need one. [chuckles]
I gotta escape the single life.

481
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:03,470
-Well?
-You shouldn't wear a sleeveless top.

482
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:04,388
HER YOUNGER SISTERS

483
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:05,639
How about this one?

484
00:21:05,722 --> 00:21:06,890
No.

485
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,226
-[chuckles]
-[sister] Maybe don't wear shorts.

486
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:11,728
[Yeo-myung] I'm a bit on the chubby side,

487
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:13,730
so I don't pull off
certain clothes very well.

488
00:21:13,814 --> 00:21:16,233
I'd like to improve that with exercise.

489
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:18,193
I wanna be able to wear cute outfits.

490
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,570
One, two… Again.

491
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:22,906
Press down on the inside. Three.

492
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:26,785
[Yeo-myung] So, right now,
I'm exercising a lot and dieting.

493
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:29,579
I'm working really hard on my glow-up.

494
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,373
WHAT IF YOU FIND SOMEONE YOU LIKE?

495
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:35,419
If someone catches my eye,
I tend to wear my heart on my sleeve.

496
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:39,172
I'll just tell them,
"I'm into you. I have a crush on you."

497
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:42,050
That's how I express my feelings.

498
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,176
Flirt? Yeah, I'll try.

499
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,553
KIM YEO-MYUNG

-[Han-na] Such a pretty smile.
-[Eun-ji] So pretty.

501
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:49,266
Don't you think the mood will shift
when she shows up?

502
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,687
Oh. Hi. Hello.

Hello.

508

-Hello. Nice to meet you.

509
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:08,243
-Oh, sit wherever you'd like.
-[Jae-yun] Sit anywhere.

510
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,120
Really? Where should I sit? Okay.

511
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:12,748
Okay. I'll sit here. [chuckles]

512
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:19,546
-[Seung-li] Nice to meet you.
-Hello.

513
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:23,175
[music fades]

514
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:24,760
Uh, what's your name?

515
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,803
Oh, I'm Kim Yeo-myung.

516
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:30,390
-Yeo-myung. Wow, what a pretty name.
-Yeo-myung, yeah. Thank you.

517
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:31,558
[giggles]

518
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:34,061
[Yeo-myung chuckles]

519
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:36,813
[Eun-ji] Oh, he's smiling.

520
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:39,149
-Seung-li's smiling.
-[Car] Is he into her?

521
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:41,943
-[Eun-ji] Wait. What was that?
-What was that just now?

522
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:44,613
-He can't look her in the eyes.
-Yeah, he can't.

523
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:45,864
You think he's interested?

524
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:49,201
He's definitely looking at her
a lot more than he is at Ji-su.

525
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:51,870
-[chuckles nervously]
-[whimsical music playing]

526
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:53,413
[hesitates] Nice to meet you.

527
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:58,126
I'm curious to see
what kind of people are coming.

528
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,419
THE BEGINNING OF ATTRACTION

529
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:01,505
[upbeat music playing]

530
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:08,178
Hey. I'm a 27-year-old
eternal single, Kim Sang-ho.

531
00:23:09,387 --> 00:23:12,849
Going to an all-boys high school,
studying engineering,

532
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:16,103
and doing military service,
I was always surrounded by guys.

533
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:18,438
I didn't have many chances to meet women.

534
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:19,564
[singing in Korean]

535
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:22,609
[in English] I sing at
a local karaoke place every day.

536
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:25,112
People say I have a nice voice.

537
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:27,531
[continues singing in Korean]

538
00:23:33,411 --> 00:23:34,704
[Sang-ho coughs]

539
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:37,791
[in English] I'm sorry, but the way
he's grabbing the mic is bothering me.

540
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:39,835
He's got his pinky under it somehow.

541
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,711
-[laughs]
-[Han-na] Wow.

542
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:44,756
[Sang-ho] Or I meet up with friends
and grab a bite.

543
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:46,383
[friend 1] Holy hell.

544
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:49,010
-That's good.
-Seeing anyone lately? You know, like…

545
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,804
-[friend 1] Why?
-No, not lately. Not ever.

546
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:53,306
-Really? Still?
-I can tell you're not dating anyone.

547
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:54,474
[friend 1] He's like…

548
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:57,727
Oh, you know.
I haven't been socializing really.

549
00:23:57,811 --> 00:24:00,063
Haven't talked to a lot of women recently.

550
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:01,857
-"Recently"?
-[chuckling] Recently.

551
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,483
[laughing] You never have, dude.

552
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:05,318
[amusing music playing]

553
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:07,821
How old are we now? 27?

554
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:10,240
If you don't hurry,
you might not ever get married.

555
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:12,033
-You've gained some weight.
-Definitely.

556
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:14,286
-Belly's looking bigger.
-It totally is.

557
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,789
-Shouldn't eat all that.
-You shouldn't sit around like this.

558
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,251
-[chuckles]
-[friend 2] You should work out, man.

559
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:24,588
[Sang-ho] Even when guys
are in mostly male social groups,

560
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:26,715
the ones who can date do so.

561
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:29,634
I think I just haven't
really been taking care of myself.

562
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:32,554
[indistinct chatter]

563
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:39,311
Okay, so, what can I help you with?

564
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:42,314
So I've been reading up on fashion lately.

565
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:44,608
What kind of clothes do you normally wear?

566
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:47,152
I wear T-shirts with characters on them.

567
00:24:47,235 --> 00:24:49,362
Like the rabbit. The rabbit character.

568
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:50,530
[quirky music plays]

569
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:52,365
That's a disaster.

570
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:54,242
Oh… [chuckles]

571
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,203
[all laughing]

572
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:57,412
You just met him.

573
00:24:57,495 --> 00:24:59,247
-Oh, I just said that because…
-No, no.

574
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,458
…I used to wear shirts just like that too.

575
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:05,128
-I did that back when I weighed 105 kilos.
-I see.

576
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:07,297
The characters get stretched out.

577
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,674
-You see what I mean, Sang-ho?
-Okay.

578
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:12,886
[Car] They get stretched out.
Don't do that to these guys.

579
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:16,014
Women will say, "You see that person
in the rabbit T-shirt?"

580
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:19,392
"Gosh, I feel bad for that rabbit."
You really wanna be that guy?

581
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:22,395
-You really wanna do that to the rabbit?
-[Sang-ho] I get it.

582
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:24,022
This little guy? Come on.

583
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:26,650
You really wanna do that?

584
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:28,944
No more character tees.

585
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:31,363
That's why I've been trying
to shift to a neater style.

586
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:32,948
Nice. You look much better.

587
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:36,743
-Now go and lose some weight.
-Okay.

588
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:39,204
-How much weight do you need to lose?
-One last sip of beer.

589
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:40,205
What are you…

590
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:41,122
Okay.

591
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:42,707
-[Car] Get going.
-Okay.

592
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:46,044
And don't lose it and then suddenly
find yourself in an all-you-can-eat buffet

593
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:48,463
-feeding your fricking face.
-I won't eat at all.

594
00:25:48,546 --> 00:25:50,215
Let's take your weight.

595
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:51,216
TRAINER YANG CHI-SEUNG

596
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:53,134
103 kilos. You said you lost weight.

597
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:55,470
Maybe I drank too much water.

598
00:25:55,553 --> 00:25:56,972
-You just drank water?
-Okay.

599
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:58,807
Maybe that's why your back is soaked.

600
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:02,644
You need to do some full body exercises
to lose overall weight.

601
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:03,645
[grunts]

602
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:05,897
-Don't lose your balance. There you go.
-Yes, sir.

603
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,232
You can do it. Bigger.

604
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:09,776
-I… will not be single.
-[energetic music playing]

605
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:11,820
-I will not be single.
-There you go.

606
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:14,948
You have a lot of built-up strength.
Use it just a little longer.

607
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:16,241
You can do it. Keep repeating.

608
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:18,410
When you come back,
you'll have a girlfriend.

609
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:19,911
-When you come back…
-Yes, sir.

610
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:21,162
…you'll have a girlfriend.

611
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,872
Yes, you can do it.

612
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:24,874
[Sang-ho] I've barely eaten any takeout.

613
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:27,669
I've been taking
much better care of myself.

614
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:31,423
When I signed up,
I was actually 106 or 107 kilos.

615
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:35,135
I lost almost 20 kilos.

616
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:39,097
I really did my best and I think
I'll be able to get a girlfriend.

617
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:43,143
-I wonder how he looks.
-I'm so curious to see.

618
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:48,356
[dramatic music builds up]

619
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:51,901
[Sang-ho] I'd say
I'm in my prime right now.

620
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:55,989
[Cupids exclaiming]

621
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:58,533
[In-guk] Wow! Look at his figure!

622
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:01,036
The shape of his face is different.

623
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,455
-[Car] He has a jaw now.
-Look, you can see it.

624
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:07,584
[Eun-ji] I mean, he's so… Oh, my.

625
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:08,710
[In-guk] He looks great.

626
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:11,171
[Han-na] Like a completely
different person.

627
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:12,922
[Eun-ji] He's so handsome.

628
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:14,883
KIM SANG-HO HIT THE JACKPOT BY LOSING 20KG

629
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:16,092
TO YOUR FUTURE GIRLFRIEND

630
00:27:16,176 --> 00:27:17,886
Hi, princess. It's me, your puppy.

631
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,929
[chuckling] "It's me, your puppy."

632
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:23,808
In order to impress you,
I worked harder than I ever have

633
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,852
-to improve myself.
-[Han-na exclaims]

634
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:28,646
Let's meet and live happily ever after.

635
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:31,524
[chuckling] Let's go.

636
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:37,280
We gotta be careful. People who've
lost weight have scary confidence.

637
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:38,365
[laughing] You're right.

638
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:41,034
Yeah, it can become,
like, unwarranted confidence.

639
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:42,619
-[Eun-ji] Yes.
-The guys so far

640
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:44,204
haven't been that confident, right?

641
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:46,498
-But he's super confident.
-He doesn't hold back.

642
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:48,083
That's what impresses me.

643
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:49,959
-He's confident, this guy.
-What? Oh, right.

644
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,920
-[Han-na] Gosh. But he did change a lot.
-Yeah.

645
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:54,964
[pleasant upbeat music playing]

646
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:56,925
[Han-na] Someone's coming.

647
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:04,307
Hey. I'm a 28-year-old
eternal single, Lee Min-hong.

648
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:05,809
I was her mentor.

649
00:28:05,892 --> 00:28:10,939
I've been on 20 to 30 blind dates
in the past seven months.

650
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:13,191
A lot of them were group dates.

651
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:17,362
But I wanted to meet someone
I could really build a future with,

652
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:23,034
so my mom signed me up with
two matchmaking companies as a gift.

653
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:26,371
I was asked on a second date…

654
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:29,290
[chuckles] …99 out of 100.

655
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:33,753
Honestly, I don't think
I have a problem looks-wise,

656
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,964
but I know I can be really blunt.

657
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:37,048
INTERVIEW WITH PRODUCERS

658
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:39,551
[staff 1] Speak naturally
as though the cameras aren't here.

659
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:41,719
Yeah, but they are. [chuckles]

660
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:44,222
-[staff 1] I know. Try to ignore them.
-Could you hide them?

661
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:45,265
[laughter]

662
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:47,058
I can say she's very honest.

663
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:50,103
I'm an extremely efficient person,

664
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:53,440
so I feel like relationships
that aren't gonna last

665
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:54,774
are just a waste of time.

666
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:58,111
Also, I have a set of
my own standards, you know?

667
00:28:58,194 --> 00:28:59,946
Like how a person walks.

668
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:02,824
And if a person
holds their chopsticks weirdly.

669
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:07,579
In that case, if they've been
holding them that way for 20 years,

670
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:09,748
and have been told to fix it and haven't,

671
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:12,584
they're probably super stubborn.

672
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:14,919
"Don't match me with someone like that."

673
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:17,213
That's what I told them.

674
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:18,715
When he was talking,

675
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:22,051
he moved his eyebrows,
like, 50 times a minute like this.

676
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:25,555
He went like, "Oh, oh, oh, oh,
that's so nice. Oh."

677
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:27,724
-When people do that…
-[staff 2] Annoying.

678
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:30,810
-[staff 3] Not good.
-[staff 1] Maybe he was really focused.

679
00:29:30,894 --> 00:29:32,187
Oh, I don't like that.

680
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,730
[staff laughing]

681
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:35,482
Right, you don't like it.

682
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:38,359
You're clear about what you don't like.

683
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:41,446
But it seems like
you have some pet peeves too.

684
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:45,074
-Yeah, that's very perceptive of you.
-[Min-hong] I saw you on TV.

685
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:46,785
[Cupids laughing and exclaiming]

686
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:49,662
-I do have pet peeves. That's true.
-[Car] Wait. Hold on.

687
00:29:49,746 --> 00:29:50,997
She's hilarious.

688
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:55,001
Even if someone is stubborn,
they can change during a relationship.

689
00:29:55,084 --> 00:29:56,377
Not easily though.

690
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:58,630
-No, no. They really do, Min-hong.
-They don't change.

691
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:00,465
The way you're thinking right now,

692
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:03,510
you're really closing yourself
off from possibilities.

693
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:06,221
-I'll try my best--
-Being clear about your likes and dislikes

694
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:07,931
is a strength of yours.

695
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:11,851
But I do worry that someone
could become interested in you,

696
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:15,271
but there is a chance
they might get scared and give up.

697
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,066
-For your own sake…
-Okay.

698
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:23,404
…I think it might be better to come off
in a more approachable way.

699
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,907
-I'll try to do that. Right.
-Yes, I think that would help.

700
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:29,994
[Min-hong] I think it'll be good for me
to try opening up more,

701
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:33,206
at least until I can see
the other person's strengths.

702
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:35,792
Let's get a boyfriend, Min-hong.

703
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:37,168
LEE MIN-HONG
THE STRAIGHT SHOOTER

704
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:39,796
Someone's gonna melt
that icy heart, right?

705
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,507
-I think so.
-Someone will. They will. I'm sure of it.

706
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:45,426
[mellow music playing]

707
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:54,102
-[Han-na] Wow!
-[Eun-ji] Her hair is very pink.

708
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:55,061
[In-guk] Very pink.

709
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:57,647
-Looks like our Ariana Grande has arrived.
-[Car laughs]

710
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,232
-She's Ariana Grande.
-Yes.

711
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:01,484
-My good friend, Ariana Grande.
-[Han-na] Nice!

712
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:06,030
Hi there. I'm a 27-year-old
eternal single, Yi Do.

713
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:10,034
I currently work
at a tutoring company called Etoos

714
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,370
where I teach Korean geography,

715
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:15,039
world geography,
and integrated social studies

716
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:16,958
to high school students.

717
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:19,043
That's so dramatic, right?

718
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:22,046
I'm the youngest CSAT instructor at Etoos.

719
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:25,967
Actually, I haven't even
graduated from college yet.

720
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:30,555
I'm currently studying geography education
at Seoul National University.

721
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:35,935
Between school and my job,
I'd say I'm pretty busy.

722
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:39,981
I heard that phrase "eternal single,"

723
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:43,943
and I thought,
"This program's perfect for me."

724
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:46,029
So I made sure to apply. [chuckles]

725
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:48,907
[Han-na] Oh, I guess
she was also asked to be on EXchange.

726
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,200
They were looking for people for season 1.

727
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:52,827
The show was still unannounced

728
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:56,164
and they were
really strict about confidentiality.

729
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,541
They emailed me an NDA and everything.

730
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:01,920
They told me about it,
but then when they told me,

731
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:05,298
"The concept is contestants
appear with their exes,"

732
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:07,467
-the excitement was gone.
-[laughter]

733
00:32:07,550 --> 00:32:09,010
"I don't have an ex."

734
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:12,055
-[staff 1] Have some water.
-Why?

735
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:14,015
-[staff 1] You're too--
-Do I look too nervous?

736
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:16,643
-[staff 1] You weren't pausing to breathe.
-I talk pretty fast.

737
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:18,603
-It's an instructor thing.
-[staff 1] Too fast.

738
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:22,148
Kids always watch lecture videos
at twice the original speed.

739
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:24,609
So my fast talking
is part of my sales pitch,

740
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:26,486
since I can save them time.

741
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:28,905
So I took it as a compliment
when they're like,

742
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:32,575
"I watch other teachers' lectures
at two times the original speed,

743
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:36,245
but I actually watch yours
on 0.7 times the original speed."

744
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:38,831
"You give very compact lectures."

745
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:40,458
Was I talking pretty fast?

746
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:42,710
-[staff 2] Got it. Have some water.
-Okay. Okay.

747
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,212
[lively quirky music playing]

748
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:47,924
So Cs has lower winter precipitation
concentration than Cw.

749
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:49,300
And what exactly is that?

750
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:52,345
So now we have downward erosion.
What happens next?

751
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:55,640
It realizes, "I came down low enough."
And then what does it do?

752
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:57,100
MEETING HER CUPID

753
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:58,685
-Hello.
-Hi, Do.

754
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:01,562
-[Yi Do exclaiming]
-[Eun-ji laughing]

755
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,982
-Oh, my gosh. I'm such a fan.
-Hi, Do. Hey, girl, hey!

756
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:07,652
-Oh, God. I can't believe this.
-Three, four. Totally. Totally. Totally.

757
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:08,861
Oh, my gosh.

758
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:11,447
"Wait. Is that a signal?"
Have you ever thought that?

759
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:13,157
He asked me to jog with him.

760
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:15,535
I went and got a whole new outfit.

761
00:33:15,618 --> 00:33:19,414
I was like, "Should I tell him?
Should I confess? What do I do?"

762
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:21,624
I mean, he must've felt us slightly touch.

763
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:24,127
-You already look tired.
-[In-guk] She didn't get a word in.

764
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:26,379
"Is he sending a signal?"
My friends all said, "Yes."

765
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:27,714
You're talking too much.

766
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:29,966
-But…
-[both laugh]

767
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:31,634
-Do you--
-I usually talk to my puppy.

768
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:32,552
Oh.

769
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:34,512
Are your puppy's ears okay?

770
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:35,805
[laughs]

771
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:37,390
I don't often feel drained,

772
00:33:37,473 --> 00:33:41,519
but I gotta say, I slept so well
when I got home after talking to Do.

773
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:42,937
-[both laugh]
-Exhausted?

774
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,939
-[Car] You needed to recharge.
-Yes.

775
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:49,152
If you try to listen more closely
when someone is talking,

776
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:50,695
I think that'll help you.

777
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:53,156
Oh, really?
If I listen, people will like me.

778
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:55,575
Because that's showing them
a different side of you.

779
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:57,160
-Try listening closely.
-Okay.

780
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:58,786
I think that'll really help you.

781
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,955
-I got it.
-Listen. Promise me you won't forget.

782
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,124
-I promise.
-Be a good listener and you'll be fine.

783
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:08,171
So, today we're going to learn
three ways of being a good listener.

784
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:12,592
Being a good listener means finding
the hidden emotion in someone's words.

785
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:15,053
-I can't seem to do that.
-"I can't seem to do that."

786
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:18,848
You'll try connecting a person's words
or attitude with your own.

787
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:21,976
This way, you're finding
stepping stones between your stories.

788
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,269
Ah.

789
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:26,439
[Do] I learned a lot about
how to talk and listen to people.

790
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:29,942
Now when someone does or says something,
I'm gonna be asking myself,

791
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:33,905
"What is that person actually thinking
behind the words they're saying?"

792
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:36,616
I'm going to have to be
more conscious of that.

793
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:38,242
Yep, that's what I'll do.

794
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:41,329
The lesson gave me courage.

795
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:42,997
YI DO
THE FAST-TALKING STAR INSTRUCTOR

796
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:46,084
Let's see how she does
when she meets them.

797
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:48,044
[Eun-ji] You got this, Do.
This is important.

798
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:50,463
-[all] Hello.
-Hi. Hello.

799
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:56,886
[Eun-ji] Oh, she's acting different.

800
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:59,806
-[whimsical music playing]
-[women chuckling]

801
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:03,309
[Eun-ji] She's really changed.

802
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:07,105
[chuckles]

803
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,439
[Min-hong] What's your name?

804
00:35:08,523 --> 00:35:11,818
Oh, my name is Yi Do.

805
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:14,028
-[Yeo-myung] Yi Do?
-[Do] One syllable each.

806
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:17,073
-[Eun-ji] Oh, she's become calmer.
-[In-guk] She seems different.

807
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:19,659
[Do] I wonder
how many more people are coming.

808
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:22,787
Wait. Just as you said that,
one more person appeared.

809
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,080
[Do] Oh, really?

810
00:35:24,163 --> 00:35:27,458
Yes. He's dressed like a businessman.

811
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:29,877
He's giving Reborn Rich vibes.

812
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,713
[mellow music playing]

813
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:36,384
What's up? I'm a 26-year-old
eternal single, Ha Jeong-mok.

814
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:41,639
Why do I always get so nervous
when my mentees show up?

815
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:42,807
I'm just nervous.

816
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,809
-Oh, are you?
-I feel nervous for them.

817
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:45,893
[Han-na] I see.

818
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:48,020
[Jeong-mok] Hello.

819
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:49,730
[indistinct chatter]

820
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:50,940
[staff 1] You can sit here.

821
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:53,276
INTERVIEW WITH PRODUCERS

822
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,695
His clothes are a bit…

823
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:59,532
-He's wearing a see-through sweater.
-It doesn't seem like it's his somehow.

824
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:00,449
[Car] Oh.

825
00:36:00,533 --> 00:36:01,701
It does kind of feel like

826
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:03,995
-he's wearing someone else's clothes.
-[In-guk] Right?

827
00:36:04,078 --> 00:36:05,371
WHAT MADE YOU APPLY?

828
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:10,126
So my twin brother kept telling me,
"Jeong-mok. If you don't do this,

829
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:12,503
you'll never be able to date girls."

830
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,839
So I filled out
the application that night.

831
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:18,009
We were brothers
who used to do everything together,

832
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:21,429
but when he got a girlfriend,
he had less time to spend with me.

833
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:23,764
So I was really lonely.

834
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:27,476
And I feel like having a dream girl
is becoming pointless.

835
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:31,022
I should just meet someone.
Anyone. I don't have time to be picky.

836
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:32,732
-I really don't.
-[staff 1] Oh, no.

837
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:35,526
[staff 2] Is saving yourself
for marriage important to you?

838
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:36,944
No, I'm open-minded.

839
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:39,530
[staff laughing]

840
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:40,948
[staff 3] Have you ever kissed?

841
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,658
Uh, no. [chuckles]

842
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:44,160
[staff 2] Why would you ask that?

843
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:45,745
[staff 3] Was that too personal?

844
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:49,165
Literally, I'm open-minded. I am.

845
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:52,001
[staff 2] Well, you're really funny.
And you're charming.

846
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:53,920
I'm not such an eternal single, huh?

847
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:55,796
[staff laughing]

848
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,298
I don't know why I still am.

850

MEETING HIS CUPID

851
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:03,179
So is it your appearance
that you would like to improve?

852
00:37:03,262 --> 00:37:06,432
I only wear clothes
that my twin brother buys.

853
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:08,267
This shirt's also his.

854
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:11,103
I think you two need to separate.

855
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:14,857
-But we still go to school together.
-I mean, I get that,

856
00:37:14,941 --> 00:37:16,943
-but you don't need to share clothes.
-I mean…

857
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:20,154
When it comes to clothes,
you have a certain aim, right?

858
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,698
For example,
if there's someone you want to date,

859
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:26,077
I think you need to be able
to style yourself in a way

860
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,536
that's flattering for you.

861
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,372
And that's part of self-confidence.

862
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:31,082
-Yun-kyeong.
-[Yun-kyeong] Yes?

863
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:33,209
He said he didn't mind going shorter.

864
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:36,170
Maybe go shorter. Just a little.

865
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:37,922
This is my actual styling team.

866
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:39,924
This kind of trendy look.

867
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:41,926
-[Han-na] So cool.
-[Eun-ji] Wow! Impressive.

868
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:44,011
-You hooked him up with your real staff.
-Yeah.

869
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:47,473
Wanna add a few pieces to spice things up?
Like a modern look?

870
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:51,811
-I think a simple necklace would work.
-[Jeong-mok] Simple?

871
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:54,981
Something like this.
I mean, you have so much to work with.

872
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:57,024
-[staff] You look very cool.
-You do.

[Cupids exclaiming]

876
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:02,989
[Eun-ji] Looks so hot.

877
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,659
-Oh, there we go.
-He looks totally different.

878
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:10,288
-I think Jeong-mok has a cool aura.
-He kind of has a Seongsu-dong vibe.

879
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:16,669
[Jeong-mok] My number-one goal
is to start my first relationship.

880
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:21,048
-I'll escape the single life.
-[Han-na] Okay.

[In-guk] He's good.

883

Someone's…

884
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,353
-Hello.
-[all] Hello.

885
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:36,689
-[Jeong-mok] Hi. Nice to meet you.
-[chuckles] Hello.

886
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,317
-[Sang-ho] Have a seat.
-[Jeong-mok] Okay.

887
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:42,737
Uh, should I sit here?

888
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,822
-Oh, you can sit wherever you want.
-Wherever.

889
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:47,033
Nice to meet you.

890
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:48,993
-Wait. Why'd you sit there?
-Nice to meet you.

891
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:51,829
-Why did you sit on the sheepskin stool?
-God! Why'd you sit there?

892
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:54,248
-[Eun-ji] There's so much space.
-[Han-na] Seriously.

893
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:58,210
-What's your name?
-Oh, I'm Ha Jeong-mok.

894
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:00,755
-Jeong-mok?
-[Jeong-mok] Mok as in "tree." Yes.

895
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:01,881
Jeong-mok.

896
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,845
[upbeat music playing]

897
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:16,270
[Eun-ji] Now, that's a big wow.

898
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:21,525
Hey there. I'm a 26-year-old
eternal single, Park Ji-yeon.

899
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,320
-Yes, she's my girl.
-[car chuckles]

900
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:26,155
-Oh.
-She's mine.

901
00:39:26,238 --> 00:39:28,574
-[Car] She's pretty.
-She has such charming eyes.

902
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:32,495
I went to an all-girls middle school,
high school, and university,

903
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:34,955
so I only have female friends.

904
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:39,418
I don't think I've been on
any blind dates or group dates.

905
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:42,088
I don't think I tried. [laughs]

906
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:44,048
I kept on waiting, thinking,

907
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:48,010
"I don't want my first relationship
to be set up by someone."

908
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:51,806
And before I knew it, I turned 26.

909
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:53,516
[chuckles]

910
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:58,020
Also, to be honest, I think I was
just trying to avoid the whole thing

911
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:03,150
because of my personal background
and how this makes me feel.

912
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:09,949
[soft emotional music playing]

913
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:10,866
[sniffles]

914
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:15,413
Well… when I was growing up,

915
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:20,418
I didn't really have
an ideal father figure

916
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,711
and that really affected me.

917
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:30,219
So, I think I've always pushed guys away
because I'm always thinking,

918
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:32,638
"Oh, he must also be like that."

919
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:36,809
"Or, eventually, he'll become like that."

920
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:40,729
Even when someone
shows actual interest in me,

921
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:42,231
I keep thinking,

922
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:45,818
"Wait. I don't think he's being genuine."

923
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:50,364
And the whole thing
just makes me really uncomfortable.

924
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,575
Mmm.

925
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:57,288
Ji-yeon has been hurt in the past.

926
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:01,542
[Ji-yeon] I've talked to a doctor
about this before.

927
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,919
I used to blame myself a lot.

928
00:41:04,003 --> 00:41:07,631
I used to think, "Did all of this happen
because of something I did?"

929
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:11,552
But I got some really good advice
and I've come to realize,

930
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:16,056
"Oh, I've been doing a great job
despite everything I've been through."

931
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:19,351
I want to show people

932
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:23,898
how I can overcome the biases
and stereotypes I feel toward men

933
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:26,567
and move forward with my life.

No, it was already super awkward.
Don't worry about that.

men and women sit next to each other.

it's fun to go and sit next to the person
who catches your eye.

-Exactly.
-Must be really hard for these guys.

tasty and not too strong.

[Hyun-kyu] I was really busy studying
to get into medical school.

Before that, I was focused on
getting into a good high school.

983

When I got to medical school,
there was so much more to study,

984
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:58,969
and it was tough to keep up.

my brain completely stops working.

unnaturally during conversations.

I can't hold a conversation very well.

JAE-YUN

00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:05,244
-[song ends]
-[chuckles]

1011
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:08,163
[in English] First of all,
I was so surprised by Jae-yun.

1012
00:45:08,247 --> 00:45:10,207
-He's changed so much.
-I can't stop saying that.

1013
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:11,125
[Car] Really.

1014
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:13,544
Whenever someone new arrives,

1015
00:45:13,627 --> 00:45:16,588
Jae-yun is the first person
to ask them a question.

1016
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:18,090
I'm so proud of him.

1017
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:20,008
-[Car] Yeah.
-I have a feeling he'll do well.

1018
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:20,968
Exactly.

1019
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:24,680
I'm worried about Min-hong,
Ji-su, and Yeo-myung.

1020
00:45:24,763 --> 00:45:27,057
Kind of like, "How will my kids do?"

1021
00:45:27,141 --> 00:45:28,767
You look concerned, Car, the garden.

1022
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:30,894
-Honestly, I'm not very confident.
-[Han-na] Really?

1023
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:33,063
-[laughing]
-[Car] I feel a little… just…

1024
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:34,731
[relaxing music playing]

1025
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:37,526
-[Do] Wow. The weather's so nice now.
-[Seung-li] Seriously.

1026
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:39,027
[Ji-su] It really is.

1027
00:45:39,736 --> 00:45:42,114
[Min-hong] Do you guys want coffee?
I need some coffee.

1028
00:45:42,197 --> 00:45:43,782
THEIR AGES AND PROFESSIONS ARE A SECRET

1029
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:44,783
-Scared me.
-[Do] What?

1030
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:46,702
-[cell phones chiming]
-[Min-hong] Mm-hmm.

1031
00:45:47,953 --> 00:45:49,496
[tense music playing]

1032
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,082
FIRST IMPRESSION VOTES WILL NOW BEGIN

1033
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:55,878
-[Han-na] As soon as they meet? Wow!
-[In-guk] Right away? People are cruel.

1034
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:58,046
-[Car] Let's go!
-[Eun-ji] But they've only just met.

1035
00:45:58,130 --> 00:45:59,131
Wait. We're already…

1036
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:03,385
EACH PERSON WILL GO TO THE IGLOO DOME
AND CHOOSE ONE PERSON THEY LIKED THE MOST

1037
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:05,012
[energetic music playing]

1038
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:06,263
IGLOO DOME

1039
00:46:06,346 --> 00:46:09,558
[Han-na] Oh, I'm curious
who their first impression pick will be.

1040
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:12,853
HOW TO VOTE

1041
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:14,730
-I'm suddenly sweating.
-[Yeo-myung] Wow.

1042
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:16,565
-I'm feeling really hot.
-I'm super shy.

1043
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:19,276
[Min-hong] One person at a time?

1044
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:22,029
-Was your last name Kang, Ji-su?
-Kang Ji-su.

1045
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:24,281
-[Do] It's so awkward.
-[Yeo-myung] What should I do?

1046
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:27,618
[Eun-ji] Wait, stop! Why did you ask that?

1047
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:28,911
Right? He's basically saying,

1048
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:31,038
-"I'm gonna pick you."
-Was he flirting?

1049
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:32,498
He's saying, "I pick you."

1050
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:35,083
-[cell phone chimes]
-[Yeo-myung] Oh.

1051
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:36,835
-I'll be back.
-[Jeong-mok] Bye.

1052
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:39,379
-[Ji-su and Yeo-myung] Bye.
-See ya.

1053
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:40,672
[Yeo-myung chuckles]

1054
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:42,758
[pleasant music playing]

1055
00:46:44,593 --> 00:46:46,803
[Han-na] Gosh. I wonder
who caught Yeo-myung's interest.

1056
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:49,640
I really can't tell
because Yeo-myung's always smiling.

1057
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:51,600
[Yeo-myung chuckles]

1058
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:54,895
YEO-MYUNG

1059
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:56,438
"First impression"?

1060
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:02,444
[chuckles]

1061
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:11,036
Okay. For the best first impression
I'm gonna put…

1062
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:15,040
[music fades]

1063
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:17,000
Noh Jae-yun.

1064
00:47:17,084 --> 00:47:18,835
[Cupids gasp and exclaim]

1065
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:20,462
[whimsical music playing]

1066
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:23,215
-Oh, man.
-[Han-na] Of course.

1067
00:47:23,298 --> 00:47:25,717
I can't put into words how proud I am.

1068
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:29,221
He stuck out to me the most
because he's so handsome.

1069
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:31,807
That was my first impression. [chuckles]

1070
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:33,642
YEO-MYUNG AND JAE-YUN FIRST MEET

1071
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:35,435
Hi, guys. [chuckles]

1072
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:37,145
-Hello.
-Hello.

1073
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:39,565
-[Yeo-myung] Hey.
-Hi.

1074
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:42,150
[whimsical music continues]

1075
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:49,032
MIN-HONG

1076
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:50,784
[contemplative music playing]

1077
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:56,957
[Min-hong] Actually, I think my best match
would be my polar opposite.

1078
00:47:58,417 --> 00:48:03,171
I can be a little impatient,
and he was kind of frustratingly slow.

1079
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:05,340
But that's why I was attracted to him.

1080
00:48:05,424 --> 00:48:07,801
-[Eun-ji] Frustratingly slow?
-[In-guk] Jae-yun?

1081
00:48:07,884 --> 00:48:09,052
[Eun-ji] Isn't that Seung-li?

1082
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:15,767
[Min-hong] I chose Jae-yun.

1083
00:48:16,435 --> 00:48:18,186
-[Car] Wait. What?
-[Eun-ji] Whoa, what?

1084
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:22,149
Wait. Min-hong also picked Jae-yun.
They're already rivals then.

1085
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:24,026
[Eun-ji] He already has two votes.

1086
00:48:24,776 --> 00:48:27,237
Honestly, I think
Jae-yun's gonna get too many votes.

1087
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:29,698
-[Han-na] Right.
-I hope someone picks my mentees.

1088
00:48:32,242 --> 00:48:33,243
JI-YEON

1089
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:36,204
-[Eun-ji] My Ji-yeon.
-[Car] I'm curious to see who she'll pick.

1090
00:48:36,288 --> 00:48:38,832
-[mellow music playing]
-[Ji-yeon] Mmm.

1091
00:48:44,504 --> 00:48:47,049
Well, for my best first impression pick,

1092
00:48:47,132 --> 00:48:48,925
I put down Jae-yun.

1093
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:50,636
[Han-na] Wait, what? Ji-yeon too?

1094
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:53,764
[Ji-yeon] I think
I tend to go for quiet guys,

1095
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:56,933
and he was especially soft-spoken.

1096
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:58,935
So I really liked him.

1097
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:02,606
[Car] Oh, wow, look at that gaze!

1098
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:04,650
[Eun-ji exclaiming]

1099
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:08,820
-[Car] This is so real, look at her.
-This is real.

1100
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:10,947
Looks like
she fell in love at first sight.

1101
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:13,575
You can see the sparks
going off in her eyes. She likes him.

1102
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:16,078
[Han-na] It's like
she can't help but gaze at him.

1103
00:49:16,161 --> 00:49:18,538
[Eun-ji] Wait. That's already
the third vote for Jae-yun.

1104
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:19,956
[Han-na] He's such a popular guy.

1105
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:22,000
JAE-YUN, THREE VOTES
YEO-MYUNG, MIN-HONG, JI-YEON

1106
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:24,378
[intense music playing]

1107
00:49:26,963 --> 00:49:28,256
[indistinct grunt]

1108
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:29,341
[Yeo-myung chuckles]

1109
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:35,430
I'm a guy, but I can still tell
that Jae-yun's good-looking.

1110
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:38,308
I think that makes him
a pretty strong contender.

1111
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:40,644
He's so handsome,

1112
00:49:41,269 --> 00:49:44,731
and since first impressions
are only based on looks,

1113
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:47,984
I was feeling
a little threatened by him, you know?

1114
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:54,282
[Do] You should change it.

1115
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:55,992
[women exclaim and laugh]

1116
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:58,412
[Do] Let's switch.

1117
00:49:58,495 --> 00:49:59,454
-Bye.
-[Jae-yun] Okay.

1118
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:04,501
I really wanna see who Jae-yun picks.

1119
00:50:04,584 --> 00:50:06,378
Seriously. Who's it gonna be?

1120
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:09,172
[chuckles]

1121
00:50:11,299 --> 00:50:13,301
[pensive music playing]

1122
00:50:17,097 --> 00:50:20,892
JAE-YUN

1123
00:50:29,317 --> 00:50:30,277
[music fades]

1124
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:33,822
[Jae-yun] The person I was
most attracted to at first

1125
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:36,116
was Kang Ji-su.

1126
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:38,535
[pleasant music playing]

1127
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:39,453
[all gasp]

1128
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:41,079
-I was right.
-See. See. Look.

1129
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:43,373
[Han-na] They match well.

1130
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:45,751
-[Eun-ji] My guess was right.
-They look good together.

1131
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:47,961
[Jae-yun] She was
the first girl to show up,

1132
00:50:48,962 --> 00:50:52,632
so I think she stayed on my mind
longer than the others.

1133
00:50:53,925 --> 00:50:56,303
And she has fair skin and big eyes

1134
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:59,681
which I found really beautiful.

1135
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,273
HYUN-KYU

1136
00:51:08,356 --> 00:51:09,816
I chose Ji-su.

1137
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:10,901
[Car] Oh, Ji-su!

1138
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:14,279
[Hyun-kyu] Why did she
in particular catch my eye?

1139
00:51:14,362 --> 00:51:17,657
I think it's probably
because she's my type.

1140
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:19,117
That's why I chose her.

1141
00:51:19,201 --> 00:51:20,911
[mellow midtempo music playing]

1142
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:23,705
SEUNG-LI

1143
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:27,250
[Seung-li] She left a strong
first impression on me. She was pretty.

1144
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:30,837
I couldn't take my eyes off her.

1145
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:33,048
I voted for Ji-su.

1146
00:51:33,131 --> 00:51:35,675
[Car] Oh, Seung-li also chose Ji-su.

1147
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:37,719
[chuckling] I fell completely in love.

1148
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:39,513
Love at first sight.

1149
00:51:41,473 --> 00:51:42,808
-[Ji-su] Hello.
-Nice to meet you.

1150
00:51:42,891 --> 00:51:44,059
SEUNG-LI AND JI-SU FIRST MEET

1151
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:46,102
[mellow midtempo music continues]

1152
00:51:51,024 --> 00:51:52,234
-Are you…
-Yeah.

1153
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:53,777
Yes.

1154
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:55,529
Nice to meet you. [sighs]

1155
00:51:56,446 --> 00:51:58,782
-[Han-na] I could tell he was into her.
-He kinda froze.

1156
00:51:58,865 --> 00:52:01,618
-He was so nervous.
-[Car] Right. That sigh.

1157
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:03,537
-He can't take his eyes off of her.
-He can't.

1158
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:04,454
Right.

1159
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:06,373
JI-SU, THREE VOTES
JAE-YUN, HYUN-KYU, SEUNG-LI

1160
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:08,208
[Eun-ji] Ji-su already has three votes.

1161
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:12,420
-[Han-na] He keeps glancing at her.
-[In-guk] Looking!

1162
00:52:12,504 --> 00:52:13,421
[Car] Wow.

1163
00:52:13,505 --> 00:52:15,507
[peppy gripping music playing]

1164
00:52:29,396 --> 00:52:31,439
[Han-na] Who is Ji-su gonna pick now?

1165
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:33,441
[music fades]

1166
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:36,111
Wow. If Ji-su picks someone else,

1167
00:52:36,194 --> 00:52:38,864
things are gonna be difficult for Jae-yun.

1168
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:40,949
-It'll get complicated.
-[Eun-ji] They'll miss out.

1169
00:52:41,032 --> 00:52:43,910
-If Ji-su understands how the show works…
-[chuckles]

1170
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:45,871
-…she's gonna pick Sang-ho.
-[Cupids laughing]

1171
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:48,498
I trust you, Ji-su. Come on now, Ji-su.

1172
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:49,708
This is Netflix.

1173
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:52,335
JI-SU

1174
00:52:52,419 --> 00:52:53,378
[sighs]

1175
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:57,257
[Ji-su] Honestly, choosing
based on the first impression was hard.

1176
00:52:57,340 --> 00:52:59,634
[contemplative music playing]

1177
00:52:59,718 --> 00:53:03,346
I thought everyone
was very cool and unique.

1178
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:08,977
But when this person came in, I thought,
"Oh, his style is just what I like."

1179
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:13,648
-Jae-yun? Jae-yun?
-[Car] "Style?"

1180
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:16,192
-[Han-na] Ji-su.
-Jeong-mok? Jeong-mok was styling today.

1181
00:53:17,485 --> 00:53:21,364
[Ji-su] So the person who gave
the best first impression was…

1182
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:23,033
[music fades]

1183
00:53:23,116 --> 00:53:24,409
For me, it was Sang-ho.

1184
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:28,788
-[Eun-ji and Han-na gasp]
-[quirky music playing]

1185
00:53:29,664 --> 00:53:30,498
[Eun-ji] Oh, boy!

1186
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:32,626
-Sang-ho!
-[Eun-ji] You kidding me?

1187
00:53:33,418 --> 00:53:35,670
-Car, the garden. Wow!
-Impossible.

1188
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:38,089
[Eun-ji] Wow!
You were super surprised, huh?

1189
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:40,133
-You're onto something. She knew.
-[Han-na] Wait…

1190
00:53:40,216 --> 00:53:43,053
-[Eun-ji] You were so shocked just now.
-I was so surprised.

1191
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:44,220
[Eun-ji] What a surprise.

1192
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:46,514
-[Car] There you go.
-[Eun-ji] I still can't believe it.

1193
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:49,726
It sounds like Ji-su's
into that teddy bear type.

1194
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:50,644
[Han-na] Wow, but…

1195
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:53,647
So Sang-ho got his first vote,
and that came from Ji-su,

1196
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:55,148
-the most popular girl.
-[Car] Wow!

1197
00:53:55,231 --> 00:53:57,400
She said she liked guys
with golden retriever energy.

1198
00:53:57,484 --> 00:53:58,902
[laughs]

1199
00:53:58,985 --> 00:54:00,445
This is getting interesting.

1200
00:54:00,528 --> 00:54:02,739
[pleasant music playing]

1201
00:54:02,822 --> 00:54:06,952
[Ji-su] I thought Sang-ho
seemed like a really reliable guy.

1202
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:10,872
And I think that was a plus for me.

1203
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:14,834
Okay. I'll be back.

1204
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:21,716
[music fades]

1205
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,052
SANG-HO

1206
00:54:24,135 --> 00:54:25,303
Oh.

1207
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:32,143
[Han-na] Okay now, Sang-ho.
You better choose well.

1208
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:35,105
Don't do anything stupid.
I'm telling you, man!

1209
00:54:35,188 --> 00:54:37,565
-[Han-na] Dude.
-[Car] Sang-ho, I'm telling you.

1210
00:54:37,649 --> 00:54:39,150
[Eun-ji] Don't do anything dumb.

1211
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:40,276
Keep it simple.

1212
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,362
Sang-ho, Ji-su's man. Who will he choose?

1213
00:54:42,445 --> 00:54:44,280
Sang-ho, go straight to Ji-su.

1214
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:46,366
[whimsical music playing]

1215
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:48,868
-[Han-na] Go, go, go.
-What's to think about?

1216
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:58,670
-Don't grab the table. Do it. Write it.
-[Han-na] Come on, Sang-ho.

1217
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:06,511
[music fades]

1218
00:55:07,178 --> 00:55:09,305
[Sang-ho] So I voted for Kim Yeo-myung.

1219
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:11,766
[peppy music playing]

1220
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:12,809
[Cupids gasp]

1221
00:55:12,892 --> 00:55:15,645
-No. They missed it. I can't believe it.
-[In-guk] Wow.

1222
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:18,356
But it does seem like
he'd like girls like Yeo-myung.

1223
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:19,649
She's lovely too, right?

1224
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:21,776
-Positive and bubbly.
-So…

1225
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:24,571
[Sang-ho] When I first saw
everyone in the room,

1226
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:28,408
my first impression was,
I just noticed that she smiled a lot.

1227
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:30,535
And I think I liked that about her.

1228
00:55:31,453 --> 00:55:34,289
Wait. Everything's crisscrossed right now.

1229
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:36,916
Nobody matched with anyone.

1230
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,295
They all have different preferences
in terms of looks.

1231
00:55:40,378 --> 00:55:42,172
YI DO

1232
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:43,548
My Ariana Grande.

1233
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:46,342
Who will Do pick?

1234
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:51,598
[Do] I thought it over a little.

1235
00:55:59,105 --> 00:56:00,482
I chose Jeong-mok.

1236
00:56:01,232 --> 00:56:02,609
Oh!

1237
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:03,818
Oh.

1238
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:04,861
[laughs]

1239
00:56:04,944 --> 00:56:06,654
-[Han-na] Wow.
-[pleasant music playing]

1240
00:56:06,738 --> 00:56:10,658
[Do] I think I went with him
mostly because of his looks.

1241
00:56:11,451 --> 00:56:13,119
I remember sitting in the lounge,

1242
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:17,832
and then Jeong-mok walked in
wearing a nice denim jacket and jeans.

1243
00:56:18,875 --> 00:56:21,377
That outfit really looked good on him.

1244
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:24,297
Plus, he was surprisingly handsome.

1245
00:56:24,923 --> 00:56:27,592
Anyway, that's what I thought.

1246
00:56:27,675 --> 00:56:29,552
That's the reason why I picked him.

1247
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:30,720
[music fades]

1248
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:32,097
[Han-na] Great makeover, In-guk.

1249
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:36,142
When I was styling him, I noticed that
he really liked wearing matching sets.

1250
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:40,063
Oh, there you go. Do is also wearing
a matching set, right? A two-piece.

1251
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:42,315
-[Do chuckles]
-[Yeo-myung] You're back.

1252
00:56:42,857 --> 00:56:43,858
[Hyun-kyu] How was it?

1253
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:45,360
[chuckles]

1254
00:56:45,443 --> 00:56:47,862
-I don't know. [chuckles]
-[women chuckling]

1255
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:52,200
[contemplative music playing]

1256
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:59,791
JEONG-MOK

1257
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:06,464
[Jeong-mok] In terms of
physical appearance,

1258
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:08,216
I like someone with a kind face,

1259
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:10,635
someone with a pretty smile.

1260
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:13,555
-[laughs]
-[women laughing]

1261
00:57:13,638 --> 00:57:16,516
[Min-hong] If it's just us,
we'll have big problems.

1262
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:18,059
-Right?
-[Ji-su] Yes, totally.

1263
00:57:18,143 --> 00:57:20,145
[contemplative music continues]

1264
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:22,188
[music fades]

1265
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:25,942
[Jeong-mok] For the first impression pick,
I voted for Yi Do.

1266
00:57:26,025 --> 00:57:28,027
-[all gasp and exclaim]
-Whoa! Do!

1267
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:30,447
He picked Ariana Grande! Oh, my God!

1268
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:31,990
[Han-na] We got one.

1269
00:57:32,073 --> 00:57:34,284
-And they matched on first impressions.
-[Car] Oh, yeah!

1270
00:57:34,367 --> 00:57:35,910
-We finally got one.
-Finally.

1271
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:39,080
[Han-na] We got one couple at least.
Nice, nice.

1272
00:57:39,164 --> 00:57:41,332
[Jeong-mok] Well, I liked her looks,

1273
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:44,377
and I chose her
because of her pretty smile.

1274
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:46,463
[upbeat music playing]

1275
00:57:55,763 --> 00:57:57,932
-[Seung-li] Oh, I'm nervous.
-[Yeo-myung laughs]

1276
00:57:58,016 --> 00:58:00,435
Was I too fast?
I mean, there wasn't much to do.

1277
00:58:01,102 --> 00:58:01,978
Yeah.

1278
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:06,858
-[In-guk] They look good together.
-[Eun-ji] Oh, yeah, they do.

1279
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:09,486
So now we have

1280
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:11,779
-the first impression pick results.
-Right.

1281
00:58:11,863 --> 00:58:14,324
And I am so proud of everyone.

1282
00:58:14,407 --> 00:58:15,283
Gosh.

1283
00:58:15,366 --> 00:58:17,702
First of all, Jae-yun dominated.

1284
00:58:17,785 --> 00:58:19,245
-Everyone picked him.
-[Eun-ji] Gosh.

1285
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:21,122
-Jeong-mok matched with someone.
-[Car] Yep.

1286
00:58:21,206 --> 00:58:23,249
Yeah. And My Ji-su got three votes.

1287
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:24,709
[Eun-ji] She got all the votes.

1288
00:58:24,792 --> 00:58:26,961
-But Yeo-myung got one too.
-But who did Ji-su pick?

1289
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:30,298
Kim Sang-ho,
who is totally clueless right now.

1290
00:58:30,381 --> 00:58:31,508
[Eun-ji] Oh, why…

1291
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:36,262
I'm sure Sang-ho doesn't have
the faintest idea that Ji-su picked him.

1292
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:37,680
Losing 20 kilos paid off.

1293
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:39,390
-[Han-na] Seriously.
-[Car] Totally.

1294
00:58:39,474 --> 00:58:40,767
It's so… Wow.

1295
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:44,145
And it's such a relief that Jeong-mok
and Yi Do picked each other.

1296
00:58:44,229 --> 00:58:46,314
-[Han-na] Totally. Exactly.
-Super happy about that.

1297
00:58:46,397 --> 00:58:47,899
-[Car] Yep.
-[Eun-ji] Truly.

1298
00:58:47,982 --> 00:58:49,442
NOH JAE-YUN
HA JEONG-MOK

1299
00:58:49,526 --> 00:58:51,694
-[Jeong-mok] This room.
-[Jae-yun] Oh, we're sharing?

1300
00:58:51,778 --> 00:58:53,196
-That one.
-Oh, there.

1301
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:55,198
Roomies.

1302
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:57,659
Wow. Am I rooming alone?

1303
00:58:57,742 --> 00:59:00,453
-[Ji-su] Min-hong's rooming alone.
-[Min-hong] See you in a bit.

1304
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:02,664
[Ji-su] See you soon.

1305
00:59:02,747 --> 00:59:03,957
[Min-hong] I'm kinda lonely.

1306
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:04,916
[Jae-yun] Oh.

1307
00:59:04,999 --> 00:59:07,168
[pleasant music playing]

1308
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:08,878
[indistinct chatter]

1309
00:59:08,962 --> 00:59:11,839
-[Ji-su] See you in a bit.
-[Yeo-myung] We'll head in first.

1310
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,592
[both chuckle and gasp]

1311
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:16,719
-This room is so nice.
-Yeah, wow, really nice.

1312
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:19,264
[Ji-su] It's much nicer than I expected.

1313
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:20,306
[Yeo-myung] Seriously.

1314
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:23,059
[Ji-su] I don't ever wanna
leave this room. [chuckles]

1315
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:26,854
Oh, man, the view.

1316
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:28,690
[Jae-yun exclaims]

1317
00:59:29,607 --> 00:59:32,277
[Jae-yun] Wow,
it looks like a landscape painting.

1318
00:59:32,777 --> 00:59:34,529
[Jeong-mok] Exactly. What a pretty view.

1319
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:36,281
This is nice.

1320
00:59:37,282 --> 00:59:39,576
I'm excited to see
what's gonna happen. [chuckles]

1321
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:44,914
When you're in beautiful surroundings,
it makes the people look even better.

1322
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:47,834
-The atmosphere can change the mood.
-[Eun-ji] It has a strange power.

1323
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:51,921
[Ji-su] "Decide who will make dinner
and then eat up."

1324
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:53,840
We'll be in groups of two.

1325
00:59:54,382 --> 00:59:55,466
Is that what it says?

1326
00:59:55,550 --> 00:59:57,051
Wait, it's four people?

1327
00:59:57,135 --> 00:59:59,095
Oh, two people will cook.

1328
00:59:59,178 --> 01:00:02,265
[Hyun-kyu] So two guys and two girls
will cook, so that's four people.

1329
01:00:02,348 --> 01:00:03,933
-[Sang-ho] Oh, you're right.
-Wait.

1330
01:00:04,017 --> 01:00:05,643
Why aren't they… Come here!

1331
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:08,730
-We have just the right number of people.
-We live up to our single status.

1332
01:00:08,813 --> 01:00:09,981
[Yeo-myung] Come here!

1333
01:00:10,064 --> 01:00:12,191
-[Min-hong] We're so far apart.
-[Ji-su] We never mix.

1334
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:15,069
-[women chuckling]
-[Min-hong] We're like water and oil.

1335
01:00:15,153 --> 01:00:17,822
-[Min-hong] Okay, we'll eat.
-[Ji-su] Hey, you're a little late.

1336
01:00:17,905 --> 01:00:19,949
-Sorry. I was in the bathroom.
-[Yeo-myung chuckles]

1337
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:21,993
-[Min-hong] Be quicker.
-[Sang-ho] Right?

1338
01:00:22,076 --> 01:00:23,536
Why aren't the two girls here?

1339
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:24,954
-Should we get them?
-Let's look.

1340
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:26,456
How about the guys go?

1341
01:00:26,539 --> 01:00:28,916
-Let's try and mix water and oil.
-You're right.

1342
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,835
-You two, you latecomers.
-[Jae-yun] Okay.

1343
01:00:30,918 --> 01:00:34,005
-Can you get the girls who aren't here?
-Yeah, you go and find them.

1344
01:00:34,088 --> 01:00:36,466
-[Ji-su] Can you?
-[Min-hong] If we go, there's no mixing.

1345
01:00:36,549 --> 01:00:38,384
-[Jae-yun] Which room are they in?
-We'll go.

1346
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:42,513
-[Ji-yeon] I'll unpack.
-Oh, those pajamas are so cute!

1347
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:44,766
[chuckling] How are they so cute?

1348
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:47,185
-[Jeong-mok] How should we…
-Left? Right?

1349
01:00:47,268 --> 01:00:48,519
[quirky music playing]

1350
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:50,188
[Jeong-mok] How should we do this?

1351
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:54,692
-Do you think I should knock?
-Wait. No, I don't think we should.

1352
01:00:55,193 --> 01:00:58,363
-Of course you can. Why not?
-Why not? [laughs]

1353
01:00:58,446 --> 01:01:00,907
-[Jeong-mok] Hold on.
-Knock from farther away.

1354
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:02,241
[knocks softly]

1355
01:01:02,325 --> 01:01:04,369
-[Han-na] How can you…
-Why are they doing that?

1356
01:01:04,452 --> 01:01:06,537
How can you knock
on the door from far away?

1357
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:08,748
They can't…
They can't even knock on a door.

1358
01:01:08,831 --> 01:01:09,707
[Eun-ji] Seriously.

1359
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:11,793
[quirky music continues]

1360
01:01:13,586 --> 01:01:14,754
Let's take turns.

1361
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:17,632
Oh, what should we do?

1362
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:20,301
I don't really wear this…

1363
01:01:20,385 --> 01:01:22,011
Wait. Did someone just knock?

1364
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:22,929
Yeah?

1365
01:01:23,930 --> 01:01:26,849
-I heard a knock. Should we answer?
-Yeah? I think I heard something too.

1366
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:30,186
[Ji-yeon] Yes?

1367
01:01:30,269 --> 01:01:31,688
-[Do] Who is it?
-What should we do?

1368
01:01:31,771 --> 01:01:33,398
[Han-na] They're running away. What?

1369
01:01:33,981 --> 01:01:35,191
Well, um…

1370
01:01:35,274 --> 01:01:37,694
-They asked us to get you.
-[Ji-yeon] Are we taking too long?

1371
01:01:37,777 --> 01:01:38,611
-No.
-[Jae-yun] No.

1372
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:40,655
-We were late too.
-[Do] Give us five minutes?

1373
01:01:40,738 --> 01:01:41,989
-Yes, take your time.
-Okay.

1374
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:44,909
Five minutes. Five minutes.

1375
01:01:45,493 --> 01:01:46,953
[Jeong-mok] We have to wait, right?

1376
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:48,579
-[Jae-yun] Let's sit.
-Where?

1377
01:01:48,663 --> 01:01:49,789
[Jae-yun] Here, let's sit.

1378
01:01:49,872 --> 01:01:52,875
Where should we…
I'm sure they'll be here soon.

1379
01:01:52,959 --> 01:01:54,210
[Jae-yun] My legs hurt.

1380
01:01:54,293 --> 01:01:56,462
[Jeong-mok] Let me check the time. 12…

1381
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:02,218
[chuckles]

1382
01:02:03,344 --> 01:02:04,887
[Car] Why are they waiting like that?

1383
01:02:04,971 --> 01:02:06,055
[Han-na chuckles] I mean…

1384
01:02:06,597 --> 01:02:09,475
[Jae-yun] If we lean…
I think we'll be more comfortable.

1385
01:02:09,559 --> 01:02:10,560
Let's do this.

1386
01:02:11,644 --> 01:02:12,979
Yeah, it's a bit hard.

1387
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:17,900
-[Eun-ji] What is this?
-[laughing] He said, "It's a bit hard."

1388
01:02:17,984 --> 01:02:20,236
-[Car] This is a sitcom.
-[Han-na] What are they doing?

1389
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:21,237
But it's so cute.

1390
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:23,448
-The awkward comments. [laughs]
-[Car] Why?

1391
01:02:24,866 --> 01:02:27,201
[Jae-yun] I'm afraid we're rushing them.

1392
01:02:27,285 --> 01:02:28,453
[Do] Oh.

1393
01:02:28,536 --> 01:02:29,996
-We're sorry.
-[Do] Oh, no.

1394
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:31,122
[Jae-yun] Take your time.

1395
01:02:31,205 --> 01:02:32,915
-I'm so sorry.
-[Jeong-mok] No, not at all.

1396
01:02:32,999 --> 01:02:34,834
-Take your time.
-[Jae-yun] It's okay.

1397
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:36,544
[Ji-yeon] We took so long. [chuckles]

1398
01:02:36,627 --> 01:02:38,045
-[Do] Sorry…
-We were late too.

1399
01:02:38,129 --> 01:02:39,046
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

1400
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:41,507
Were you sent to get us
as a punishment? [chuckles]

1401
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:42,592
No, we wanted to.

1402
01:02:42,675 --> 01:02:43,676
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

1403
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:44,844
[Cupids gasp]

1404
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:46,721
Jeong-mok is good.

1405
01:02:46,804 --> 01:02:49,432
[Ji-yeon] Oh, no. Come on. We gotta hurry.

1406
01:02:49,515 --> 01:02:50,892
[Jeong-mok] Careful. Don't trip.

1407
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:57,315
[Yeo-myung] You can sit. Why do you think…
Uh, wait. Come here.

1408
01:02:57,398 --> 01:02:58,483
[indistinct chatter]

1409
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:07,742
YEO-MYUNG, JI-YEON, JAE-YUN

1410
01:03:07,825 --> 01:03:11,245
-[Jeong-mok] Five of us can cook tomorrow.
-[Ji-su] Looks good. Really good.

1411
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:13,706
[whimsical music playing]

1412
01:03:15,416 --> 01:03:18,669
THE SEAT IN FRONT OF JAE-YUN IS EMPTY

1413
01:03:30,973 --> 01:03:31,891
[indistinct chatter]

1414
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:33,226
Come here. I'll show you.

1415
01:03:35,686 --> 01:03:36,521
Sit here.

1416
01:03:39,023 --> 01:03:41,317
-[Car] Oh! Did she change seats?
-[Han-na] Wow!

1417
01:03:41,400 --> 01:03:43,778
Wow, Ji-yeon! Good job!

1418
01:03:43,861 --> 01:03:45,696
This is how you start.
Gotta start somewhere.

1419
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:46,739
Totally.

1420
01:03:48,449 --> 01:03:49,283
Sit here.

1421
01:03:49,909 --> 01:03:51,410
[Do] I saw there was a bathroom here.

1422
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:52,328
Really?

1423
01:03:52,411 --> 01:03:55,248
[Do] Yes, it's right out front.
You don't have to go back to your room.

1424
01:03:55,331 --> 01:03:57,333
[pleasant music playing]

1425
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:04,590
JI-YEON, JAE-YUN

1426
01:04:04,674 --> 01:04:06,300
[Yeo-myung] Right. You're right.

1427
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:09,762
When my roommate was coming back in,

1428
01:04:10,555 --> 01:04:15,476
I sneakily moved to the next seat
and said, "Sit here."

1429
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:16,853
[chuckles]

1430
01:04:16,936 --> 01:04:18,813
It was the first time I've done that.

1431
01:04:18,896 --> 01:04:22,024
It was the bravest thing
I've ever done. [chuckles]

1432
01:04:22,108 --> 01:04:23,693
[indistinct chatter]

1433
01:04:23,776 --> 01:04:24,819
[Ji-yeon laughs]

1434
01:04:24,902 --> 01:04:26,904
[pleasant music continues]

1435
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:29,991
I wanted to talk to Jae-yun,

1436
01:04:30,074 --> 01:04:32,034
but he was sitting
at the end of the table.

1437
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:34,620
[giggling] So I couldn't
say anything to him.

1438
01:04:43,462 --> 01:04:44,547
[music fades]

1439
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:46,591
JI-SU, SANG-HO

1440
01:04:46,674 --> 01:04:48,092
[Car] Nice work, Ji-su and Sang-ho.

1441
01:04:48,175 --> 01:04:49,760
-Sitting next to each other.
-Good work.

1442
01:04:49,844 --> 01:04:51,262
-[Car] Well done.
-[Eun-ji] Next…

1443
01:04:52,138 --> 01:04:54,473
-It's late. It's already past 7:30.
-[Jeong-mok] It is?

1444
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:56,225
[chuckles] Well, it's 7:23.

1445
01:04:58,477 --> 01:04:59,812
[Hyun-kyu] Champagne?

1446
01:05:00,605 --> 01:05:02,899
-[Min-hong] I'm hungry.
-[Hyun-kyu] It took about an hour.

1447
01:05:02,982 --> 01:05:04,984
[mellow music playing]

1448
01:05:05,860 --> 01:05:08,362
[Ji-su] Thankfully,
Sang-ho was sitting next to me.

1449
01:05:08,446 --> 01:05:11,198
That made me happy
because I wanted to talk to him.

1450
01:05:14,869 --> 01:05:17,330
[Sang-ho] I sat at the end of the table

1451
01:05:17,413 --> 01:05:21,626
because it was really hot
and I totally wanted to be near the fan.

1452
01:05:21,709 --> 01:05:23,085
[amusing music playing]

1453
01:05:23,169 --> 01:05:24,295
[Cupids laughing]

1454
01:05:24,378 --> 01:05:27,173
[Han-na] Okay, it wasn't intentional.
Never mind.

1455
01:05:27,256 --> 01:05:28,841
-My God!
-What was…

1456
01:05:28,925 --> 01:05:29,800
What is this?

1457
01:05:29,884 --> 01:05:31,969
-He said he sweats a lot…
-[In-guk] Right.

1458
01:05:32,053 --> 01:05:34,055
-…so he needs to cool down.
-Too much yin energy?

1459
01:05:34,138 --> 01:05:36,098
-He sweats a lot.
-[Eun-ji] You're both that way.

1460
01:05:36,182 --> 01:05:38,142
-[Han-na] Come on.
-We're both big sweaters.

1461
01:05:38,225 --> 01:05:41,604
But this is a dating show,
and he sat there because of the fan?

1462
01:05:41,687 --> 01:05:45,024
But he shouldn't be sweating buckets
while he's on a dating show.

1463
01:05:45,107 --> 01:05:47,068
-[Han-na] That's true.
-We'll keep an eye on him.

1464
01:05:47,151 --> 01:05:49,487
-I didn't think he'd say that.
-[Han-na] But he did.

1465
01:05:49,570 --> 01:05:52,198
-He just says things like that.
-[Eun-ji] We'll watch out for him.

1466
01:05:54,033 --> 01:05:55,368
[Min-hong] In case I get hungry.

1467
01:05:56,243 --> 01:05:57,453
For insomnia.

1468
01:05:58,120 --> 01:06:00,122
[mellow music playing]

1469
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:05,628
I was like, "Should I hang around him?"

1470
01:06:05,711 --> 01:06:07,463
We're on the dinner team together,

1471
01:06:07,546 --> 01:06:11,342
so I should at least try to get close
to him and see what happens.

1472
01:06:12,551 --> 01:06:13,970
[Min-hong] I think it goes in here.

1473
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:16,514
-Wow.
-It's okay now.

1474
01:06:16,597 --> 01:06:18,933
[Ji-su] Gosh,
I don't know why I couldn't do it.

1475
01:06:19,016 --> 01:06:22,144
I want to be friendly,
but I can't express myself.

1476
01:06:22,228 --> 01:06:25,147
Maybe we'll get
more opportunities to talk.

1477
01:06:26,273 --> 01:06:28,359
I really hope we do. [chuckles]

1478
01:06:28,442 --> 01:06:29,485
This is great.

1479
01:06:29,568 --> 01:06:30,403
[Min-hong] I forget.

1480
01:06:30,486 --> 01:06:33,489
I'm so bad with names,
so I definitely can't remember MBTI types.

1481
01:06:33,572 --> 01:06:34,699
-Really?
-[Min-hong] Yes.

1482
01:06:36,742 --> 01:06:38,160
We went downtown.

1483
01:06:39,203 --> 01:06:40,538
[women laughing]

1484
01:06:40,621 --> 01:06:41,956
[indistinct chatter]

1485
01:06:42,623 --> 01:06:45,584
[Do] We can't talk about
how we're feeling, right?

1486
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:47,962
-Like, who we like.
-[Ji-yeon] Honestly, I want to.

1487
01:06:48,045 --> 01:06:51,173
[gasps] Wait. Okay, tell me first.

1488
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:53,926
-Tell me who you like.
-Okay. I'll just say it.

1489
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:54,927
I like Jae…

1490
01:06:56,095 --> 01:06:58,264
-[Do] Noh Jae-yun?
-Yeah, Noh Jae-yun.

1491
01:06:58,347 --> 01:07:00,808
-You sat across from him. You like him?
-Yeah, I did. Yes.

1492
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:02,518
You like him too?

1493
01:07:03,185 --> 01:07:05,271
[Do] Well, there's one guy
who made me think,

1494
01:07:05,354 --> 01:07:08,357
"Oh, he's pretty cool."
And his name ends with "mok."

1495
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:09,775
Ha Jeong-mok?

1496
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:12,069
-[chuckles] Ha Jeong-mok.
-Did you write it all down?

1497
01:07:12,153 --> 01:07:15,114
But I'm not completely decided
on one person yet, to be honest.

1498
01:07:15,197 --> 01:07:16,073
Oh, really?

1499
01:07:16,157 --> 01:07:18,451
-[Do] Oh, you've decided?
-Yeah. I have.

1500
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:20,202
-[Yi Do gasps] Really?
-[chuckles] Yes.

1501
01:07:20,286 --> 01:07:22,163
So, we were sitting like this, right?

1502
01:07:22,246 --> 01:07:24,373
-Come here. I'll show you.
-Yes, let's sit like this.

1503
01:07:24,457 --> 01:07:26,625
-[Do] Wait, look. Jae-yun was here.
-Right.

1504
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:29,920
-He wasn't saying a word.
-I actually kind of like quiet guys.

1505
01:07:30,004 --> 01:07:33,883
-Really? He was a little too quiet for me.
-I like people like that.

1506
01:07:33,966 --> 01:07:35,634
-Oh, really?
-I like guys who are calmer.

1507
01:07:36,218 --> 01:07:38,137
-I like that type.
-I'll help you get your guy.

1508
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:39,638
-It's okay.
-What can I do?

1509
01:07:41,432 --> 01:07:42,892
-[cell phone chimes]
-[Yeo-myung] Oh.

1510
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:45,019
-[Seung-li] We got a text.
-[Sang-ho] What's it say?

1511
01:07:45,102 --> 01:07:48,606
"Eternal Singles' Night
will be held here every night."

1512
01:07:48,689 --> 01:07:51,067
[chuckling] What's that?
Eternal Singles' Night?

1513
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:52,193
Like a campfire?

1514
01:07:52,276 --> 01:07:53,402
[both laugh]

1515
01:07:53,486 --> 01:07:54,945
Like on a field trip.

1516
01:07:55,654 --> 01:07:57,990
PLEASE COME TO THE EVENT AREA

1517
01:07:58,074 --> 01:07:59,116
-[Han-na] Nice.
-It's good.

1518
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:01,911
They need things like this
so they can keep seeing each other.

1519
01:08:01,994 --> 01:08:03,704
-[Eun-ji] They need it.
-[Han-na] Totally.

1520
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:07,792
Let's go a little bit later
so I can sit down after Jae-yun does.

1521
01:08:07,875 --> 01:08:08,709
Okay, got it.

1522
01:08:08,793 --> 01:08:09,752
[Ji-yeon gasps]

1523
01:08:10,252 --> 01:08:11,170
Okay.

1524
01:08:11,253 --> 01:08:12,963
-Here.
-[Do] You wanna scope it out?

1525
01:08:13,047 --> 01:08:14,173
[whimsical music playing]

1526
01:08:14,256 --> 01:08:15,591
You're so funny.

1527
01:08:15,674 --> 01:08:16,967
[Ji-yeon chuckles]

1528
01:08:17,051 --> 01:08:18,928
-Oh, I can see.
-[Do] Wait, can you really?

1529
01:08:19,011 --> 01:08:21,305
-Hold on.
-Up here. You can see from up here.

1530
01:08:21,388 --> 01:08:24,225
-I see someone. One person.
-[Ji-yeon] Nobody's there. Really?

1531
01:08:24,308 --> 01:08:26,185
-One person. I can't tell who.
-A girl? A guy?

1532
01:08:26,268 --> 01:08:28,479
-A guy.
-Are they alone? Is it Sang-ho?

1533
01:08:28,562 --> 01:08:29,647
[Do] Wait, wait.

1534
01:08:29,730 --> 01:08:31,607
Hyung… Hyun-kyu.

1535
01:08:31,690 --> 01:08:32,525
[Ji-yeon] Hyun-kyu?

1536
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:34,110
[Do] Right? Hyun-kyu.

1537
01:08:34,693 --> 01:08:36,070
[Ji-yeon] You wanna go now?

1538
01:08:36,153 --> 01:08:38,864
-Why? No. Once Jae-yun's outside.
-Right.

1539
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:40,908
Let's leave right away
once Jae-yun comes out.

1540
01:08:40,991 --> 01:08:42,868
-You're like a meerkat…
-We're okay for now.

1541
01:08:42,952 --> 01:08:44,286
…scoping out the field.

1542
01:08:44,370 --> 01:08:46,372
-[Do] I'll keep looking.
-Hilarious. [laughs]

1543
01:08:46,455 --> 01:08:49,375
-[Jae-yun] Okay, let's go.
-Thank you. Let's go.

1544
01:08:49,458 --> 01:08:51,710
[low peppy music playing]

1545
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:52,753
[Jeong-mok] Where?

1546
01:08:52,837 --> 01:08:55,172
-[Jae-yun] I think it's this.
-[Jeong-mok] Someone's there.

1547
01:08:57,133 --> 01:08:59,343
[Ji-yeon] Should I take a look?
[gasps] He's here!

1548
01:08:59,426 --> 01:09:00,594
-He's outside.
-He's here.

1549
01:09:00,678 --> 01:09:03,097
-[mimics Ji-yeon] "He's here." [laughs]
-[Han-na] So cute.

1550
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:06,016
-[Ji-yeon] This is how you fight for love.
-[Do] Of course.

1551
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:08,102
[peppy music continues]

1552
01:09:12,606 --> 01:09:13,566
[music fades]

1553
01:09:13,649 --> 01:09:14,984
[Car] Don't miss your chance!

1554
01:09:15,067 --> 01:09:17,027
[Han-na] Yeo-myung, gotta do it!
Shoot your shot!

1555
01:09:17,111 --> 01:09:19,989
-[Yeo-myung] Hi. I'll sit here.
-[Jeong-mok] I brushed my teeth already.

1556
01:09:21,365 --> 01:09:23,534
-[Car] That's it! Nice job.
-[Eun-ji] Good! Well done.

1557
01:09:23,617 --> 01:09:24,785
[midtempo music playing]

1558
01:09:24,869 --> 01:09:27,204
-[Do] Everyone's there.
-[Ji-yeon] Are we last again?

1559
01:09:27,288 --> 01:09:28,414
[Do] Oh, no.

1560
01:09:28,497 --> 01:09:30,166
-[Do] Oh, gosh.
-[Ji-yeon] Oh, no.

1561
01:09:30,833 --> 01:09:31,667
[Do] Damn.

1562
01:09:34,086 --> 01:09:35,254
-Oh.
-Oh.

1563
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:38,841
Wow. Looks good.

1564
01:09:42,511 --> 01:09:44,346
We were watching from the window.

1565
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:48,434
We tried to plan ahead,
but we were last again. [chuckles]

1566
01:09:48,517 --> 01:09:49,894
I was a bit too late.

1567
01:09:49,977 --> 01:09:54,565
Yeo-myung was sitting next to him,
and that bothered me a little bit.

1568
01:09:56,108 --> 01:09:57,860
[Yeo-myung] I was feeling great.
I was like,

1569
01:09:57,943 --> 01:09:59,737
"I got a good seat." [chuckles]

1570
01:09:59,820 --> 01:10:01,780
I got a chance to get to know him.

1571
01:10:06,285 --> 01:10:07,244
ETERNAL SINGLES' NIGHT

1572
01:10:07,328 --> 01:10:08,412
[Do] So cute.

1573
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:09,872
[Yeo-myung] Mmm.

1574
01:10:09,955 --> 01:10:10,831
[cell phones chiming]

1575
01:10:10,915 --> 01:10:11,832
Oh.

1576
01:10:13,334 --> 01:10:16,545
TONIGHT, YOU WILL GET TO KNOW EACH OTHER
THROUGH CONVERSATION

1577
01:10:16,629 --> 01:10:19,256
SHARE WHY YOU ARE SINGLE
AND YOUR EXPERIENCES OF BEING REJECTED

1578
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:20,424
[laughs]

1579
01:10:20,507 --> 01:10:23,260
Isn't this
kind of like public humiliation?

1580
01:10:23,344 --> 01:10:25,763
-[whimsical music playing]
-[laughing]

1581
01:10:26,347 --> 01:10:28,307
[Min-hong] Who will be humiliated first?

1582
01:10:29,808 --> 01:10:31,018
Let's pick one person

1583
01:10:31,101 --> 01:10:32,603
-and go around.
-Start here.

1584
01:10:32,686 --> 01:10:35,231
Can you two do rock-paper-scissors?

1585
01:10:37,274 --> 01:10:39,568
-Wait. So will the loser go first?
-[Jae-yun] Yes.

1586
01:10:39,652 --> 01:10:40,611
[chuckles softly]

1587
01:10:40,694 --> 01:10:42,279
[Do] Rock, paper, scissors.

1588
01:10:43,364 --> 01:10:45,741
-[Yeo-myung] Wait, so…
-[Jae-yun] Right. So, I'm…

1589
01:10:45,824 --> 01:10:47,952
-[Hyun-kyu] Go this way?
-It's okay. That's fine.

1590
01:10:48,035 --> 01:10:49,411
[Hyun-kyu] One minute each.

1591
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:51,580
[amusing music playing]

1592
01:10:51,664 --> 01:10:53,332
The reason I'm an eternal single…

1593
01:10:53,415 --> 01:10:54,250
[laughs]

1594
01:10:54,333 --> 01:10:55,960
[Sang-ho] Hmm. Confession.

1595
01:10:57,670 --> 01:11:01,507
…is because I'm a homebody
and I rarely go out, so…

1596
01:11:02,341 --> 01:11:05,469
I never have the chance to meet women.

1597
01:11:05,552 --> 01:11:07,471
-[Seung-li] I see.
-[laughs]

1598
01:11:07,554 --> 01:11:10,015
But if you did go out,
I think you'd be very popular.

1599
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:12,268
But I'm not… really.

1600
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:17,022
And I say that because
I've been rejected quite a few times.

1601
01:11:17,106 --> 01:11:18,148
[contestants] Oh.

1602
01:11:18,232 --> 01:11:19,149
Yeah.

1603
01:11:19,984 --> 01:11:24,280
When I was in high school,
there was this girl at my church.

1604
01:11:24,363 --> 01:11:25,948
I had a crush on her.

1605
01:11:26,615 --> 01:11:27,783
Then one day,

1606
01:11:29,034 --> 01:11:32,496
even though I was underage, I was drinking

1607
01:11:33,163 --> 01:11:34,331
with my dad.

1608
01:11:35,666 --> 01:11:38,877
I got drunk and sent her a long message.

1609
01:11:40,087 --> 01:11:41,463
It said something like,

1610
01:11:42,589 --> 01:11:45,551
"I've liked you since last fall,
blah, blah, blah."

1611
01:11:45,634 --> 01:11:49,471
-It's romantic. That's so romantic.
-[Jae-yun] It was a really long message.

1612
01:11:51,724 --> 01:11:55,102
And she responded,
"I'm more into older guys."

1613
01:11:55,185 --> 01:11:56,729
-[laughs]
-[Seung-li] Ah.

1614
01:11:56,812 --> 01:11:58,063
[Jae-yun] "Sorry."

1615
01:11:58,647 --> 01:12:01,817
But I found out later
that she already had a boyfriend.

1616
01:12:07,364 --> 01:12:09,616
[Car] It's funny how things
suddenly got so solemn.

1617
01:12:09,700 --> 01:12:10,909
Right. It's too relatable.

1618
01:12:10,993 --> 01:12:13,537
-They've all been in the same boat.
-[Car] They can all relate.

1619
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:15,831
Okay. Let's move on.

1620
01:12:15,914 --> 01:12:16,874
[laughing]

1621
01:12:16,957 --> 01:12:19,460
-[Sang-ho] He seems too…
-Why are we clapping? Do we have to?

1622
01:12:19,543 --> 01:12:21,712
-[Sang-ho] Round of applause.
-[Min-hong] Let's do it.

1623
01:12:21,795 --> 01:12:22,629
[Yeo-myung] Next.

1624
01:12:24,048 --> 01:12:24,882
So,

1625
01:12:26,717 --> 01:12:31,096
back in the day, I asked a girl
from class to watch a movie with me.

1626
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:33,432
But she kept saying she couldn't

1627
01:12:33,515 --> 01:12:36,685
because she was going abroad
the next week.

1628
01:12:36,769 --> 01:12:38,020
[amusing music playing]

1629
01:12:38,103 --> 01:12:40,647
I thought, "Oh, she must be going
to study abroad."

1630
01:12:40,731 --> 01:12:42,775
But then later, I saw her on Instagram

1631
01:12:42,858 --> 01:12:45,235
that it was only a short trip to Japan.

1632
01:12:45,903 --> 01:12:46,987
For just three days.

1633
01:12:47,696 --> 01:12:49,531
I went on an even longer trip.

1634
01:12:49,615 --> 01:12:51,825
[laughs] I see.

1635
01:12:51,909 --> 01:12:52,951
That's not too bad though.

1636
01:12:53,035 --> 01:12:55,245
Yeah, she was
trying to turn me down gently.

1637
01:12:55,329 --> 01:12:56,163
[Ji-yeon] Ah.

1638
01:12:56,246 --> 01:12:58,374
[contestants chuckling]

1639
01:12:58,457 --> 01:12:59,541
[music fades]

1640
01:12:59,625 --> 01:13:02,920
I mean, I've had many crushes,

1641
01:13:03,003 --> 01:13:06,256
and I've never gotten rejected
when I've confessed to someone.

1642
01:13:07,091 --> 01:13:08,801
But I did have this happen.

1643
01:13:08,884 --> 01:13:11,095
He said, "Let's go jogging together."

1644
01:13:11,178 --> 01:13:13,764
So of course I thought,
"We're more than friends."

1645
01:13:14,348 --> 01:13:19,269
And when we went running,
I tried to talk to him while running, but…

1646
01:13:20,020 --> 01:13:22,147
it's hard to talk while running, you know?

1647
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:23,524
[chuckles] Right.

1648
01:13:23,607 --> 01:13:25,651
-[all laughing]
-[Hyun-kyu] You're out of breath.

1649
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:31,240
But then he said to me,
"Do, when we go running, just run."

1650
01:13:31,323 --> 01:13:33,033
-[laughs]
-[contestants laugh]

1651
01:13:33,117 --> 01:13:35,202
-So--
-He really just wanted a workout buddy…

1652
01:13:35,285 --> 01:13:39,081
I guess so. I definitely thought
there was something there between us,

1653
01:13:39,915 --> 01:13:43,335
but then, pretty soon
after the whole jogging thing,

1654
01:13:43,419 --> 01:13:45,045
he got a girlfriend.

1655
01:13:45,671 --> 01:13:47,423
I was super sad about it.

1656
01:13:48,340 --> 01:13:49,633
[Ji-su] That makes me sad.

1657
01:13:49,716 --> 01:13:51,844
-We're similar. Same situation.
-[Do] Oh, really?

1658
01:13:51,927 --> 01:13:53,846
I've had many experiences like that.

1659
01:13:53,929 --> 01:13:57,391
Well, were you thinking,
"He's definitely sending me a signal"?

1660
01:13:58,225 --> 01:14:02,729
"Let's go run together."
I mean, isn't that 100% a signal?

1661
01:14:02,813 --> 01:14:05,399
Who goes running
with someone at Han River?

1662
01:14:05,482 --> 01:14:06,817
It was just you two?

1663
01:14:06,900 --> 01:14:09,361
-Yeah, it was just me and him.
-Oh, that's kind of mean.

1664
01:14:10,487 --> 01:14:12,406
[Jeong-mok] Do was the most memorable.

1665
01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:15,242
She's really social and cheerful,

1666
01:14:16,243 --> 01:14:17,911
and she has a pretty smile.

1667
01:14:17,995 --> 01:14:20,164
[pleasant music playing]

1668
01:14:21,957 --> 01:14:25,294
I still think Do is the closest
to my ideal type,

1669
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:28,797
so she's still my number one choice.

1670
01:14:28,881 --> 01:14:31,383
I'm still going with
my first impression pick.

1671
01:14:32,968 --> 01:14:34,678
[contestants laughing]

1672
01:14:37,347 --> 01:14:39,766
He thinks her smile's pretty!

1673
01:14:39,850 --> 01:14:41,143
He finds her adorable.

1674
01:14:41,226 --> 01:14:42,436
He's getting butterflies.

1675
01:14:42,519 --> 01:14:44,938
Girls with that kind of personality
need a guy like that.

1676
01:14:45,022 --> 01:14:47,691
-[Han-na] They're a great fit.
-[Car] Someone who adores them.

1677
01:14:48,275 --> 01:14:49,485
Okay, so…

1678
01:14:50,110 --> 01:14:54,239
When I was a kid,
I actually lived abroad in Brazil.

1679
01:14:54,323 --> 01:14:56,366
I was there for 12 years.

1680
01:14:57,284 --> 01:15:00,120
The culture and language were unfamiliar,

1681
01:15:00,204 --> 01:15:02,539
so it was hard to approach people.

1682
01:15:04,249 --> 01:15:06,668
In high school or maybe middle school,

1683
01:15:07,461 --> 01:15:10,923
girls were sitting all around me,
and I was the only guy.

1684
01:15:11,590 --> 01:15:13,759
I must've said something wrong

1685
01:15:13,842 --> 01:15:18,180
because they all
started yelling at me and swearing.

1686
01:15:18,263 --> 01:15:20,140
[solemn music playing]

1687
01:15:20,224 --> 01:15:22,935
I was… scarred by that experience,

1688
01:15:23,018 --> 01:15:26,438
and it became hard for me
to approach women.

1689
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:30,776
Do you think it was
because of a miscommunication?

1690
01:15:30,859 --> 01:15:32,236
-That's right.
-[Sang-ho] I see.

1691
01:15:32,319 --> 01:15:35,614
-I didn't really understand the culture.
-Right. That's why.

1692
01:15:35,697 --> 01:15:36,823
So mean.

1693
01:15:38,116 --> 01:15:40,994
-[Hyun-kyu] Must've felt terrible.
-I don't think about it too much now.

1694
01:15:42,079 --> 01:15:42,913
So…

1695
01:15:43,455 --> 01:15:46,250
So, you lived in Brazil for 12 years?

1696
01:15:46,333 --> 01:15:50,295
Yeah. We moved there when I was eight

1697
01:15:50,379 --> 01:15:52,589
and then came back after graduation.

1698
01:15:52,673 --> 01:15:54,883
Your Korean is really good.

1699
01:15:55,467 --> 01:15:56,426
Is it?

1700
01:15:56,510 --> 01:15:59,429
Sometimes, with more difficult words,
I get confused.

1701
01:15:59,513 --> 01:16:00,806
[contestants] Hmm.

1702
01:16:04,309 --> 01:16:06,478
What other languages do you speak?

1703
01:16:06,562 --> 01:16:09,523
Just Portuguese, Spanish…

1704
01:16:09,606 --> 01:16:11,358
-[Sang-ho] Wow.
-…English, and Korean.

1705
01:16:11,441 --> 01:16:12,776
[contestants exclaim]

1706
01:16:12,859 --> 01:16:14,361
[Hyun-kyu] Quadrilingual.

1707
01:16:14,444 --> 01:16:15,279
[Ji-yeon] Cool.

1708
01:16:18,949 --> 01:16:22,202
[Do] Seung-li told us
how he used to live in Brazil

1709
01:16:22,286 --> 01:16:25,706
and he described a past experience he had

1710
01:16:25,789 --> 01:16:28,584
that really affected who he is today.

1711
01:16:29,668 --> 01:16:34,172
I found his vulnerability
really attractive.

1712
01:16:34,256 --> 01:16:37,134
-[enchanting music playing]
-I was really impressed

1713
01:16:37,217 --> 01:16:38,594
that he told us that.

1714
01:16:38,677 --> 01:16:41,597
I thought his attitude was cool,

1715
01:16:42,139 --> 01:16:43,599
and just…

1716
01:16:44,766 --> 01:16:47,144
He had a cool look in his eyes. [giggles]

1717
01:16:48,687 --> 01:16:52,065
When we locked eyes, I felt kind of shy.

1718
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:54,484
[giggles giddily]

1719
01:16:55,986 --> 01:16:57,362
WHO ARE YOU MOST ATTRACTED TO NOW?

1720
01:16:57,446 --> 01:16:58,697
[sighs] My top choice?

1721
01:17:00,407 --> 01:17:02,534
[chuckles nervously] Oh, what should I do?

1722
01:17:05,329 --> 01:17:08,165
At first, it was totally Jeong-mok.

1723
01:17:08,248 --> 01:17:09,666
But now it's a tie.

1724
01:17:09,750 --> 01:17:11,877
It's Jeong-mok

1725
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:13,795
and Seung-li.

1726
01:17:13,879 --> 01:17:16,131
[enchanting music continues]

1727
01:17:17,966 --> 01:17:19,426
[inaudible chatter]

1728
01:17:22,971 --> 01:17:23,972
[music fades]

1729
01:17:24,056 --> 01:17:28,185
Do you think we'll find out
who voted for whom in first impressions?

1730
01:17:28,268 --> 01:17:29,728
-The results?
-[Min-hong] If someone…

1731
01:17:29,811 --> 01:17:31,730
-I don't think they'll tell us.
-I'm not sure.

1732
01:17:31,813 --> 01:17:34,358
Oh, really? I'm worried about that.

1733
01:17:35,233 --> 01:17:36,401
You have regrets?

1734
01:17:36,485 --> 01:17:37,527
No.

1735
01:17:37,611 --> 01:17:38,445
[laughter]

1736
01:17:38,528 --> 01:17:40,489
-No. It's not that.
-[Ji-yeon] I guess she does.

1737
01:17:40,572 --> 01:17:41,406
I'm kidding.

1738
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:42,699
It's embarrassing.

1739
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:44,618
[low electronic music playing]

1740
01:17:44,701 --> 01:17:47,079
[Jeong-mok] I'm a little concerned
about Seung-li.

1741
01:17:47,996 --> 01:17:50,332
When I saw Do talking to him…
[inhales sharply]

1742
01:17:51,208 --> 01:17:53,293
…it seemed like she was into him.

1743
01:17:54,294 --> 01:17:56,088
And that kind of worries me.

1744
01:17:56,171 --> 01:17:58,173
[mellow electronic music playing]

1745
01:18:04,429 --> 01:18:06,723
[inaudible chatter]

1746
01:18:07,432 --> 01:18:10,769
[Jae-yun] The person I was
attracted to at first was Kang Ji-su.

1747
01:18:12,688 --> 01:18:13,814
But now,

1748
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:17,150
I think it's Yeo-myung.

1749
01:18:18,694 --> 01:18:20,445
-Jae-yun's changed his mind too?
-He did.

1750
01:18:20,529 --> 01:18:22,864
-[Eun-ji] It's not Ji-su?
-[Han-na] What? Why?

1751
01:18:22,948 --> 01:18:26,326
Some people become more attractive
the more you see them.

1752
01:18:27,369 --> 01:18:29,538
She has a… such a nice smile,

1753
01:18:29,621 --> 01:18:34,793
and she seems to have a really cheerful
and bubbly personality.

1754
01:18:35,711 --> 01:18:38,463
Those two things were big positives to me.

1755
01:18:39,673 --> 01:18:40,924
[indistinct chatter]

1756
01:18:41,007 --> 01:18:44,845
[Jae-yun] Tomorrow,
I'm gonna try to go out with Yeo-myung.

1757
01:18:45,929 --> 01:18:48,640
-Ah! So we have a match.
-Yeah, sounds like we do.

1758
01:18:49,808 --> 01:18:52,811
[Yeo-myung] I voted for Jae-yun
as my first impression pick.

1759
01:18:53,478 --> 01:18:57,858
So I tried to talk to him
because I wanted to get to know him.

1760
01:18:57,941 --> 01:19:00,318
But he really didn't talk much,

1761
01:19:00,402 --> 01:19:02,279
even when I tried talking to him.

1762
01:19:02,904 --> 01:19:03,905
You gotta win.

1763
01:19:04,531 --> 01:19:05,991
-Win!
-[women laugh]

1764
01:19:06,575 --> 01:19:08,618
-How much? Tell me when.
-Where'd I put that? There.

1765
01:19:08,702 --> 01:19:09,703
Okay.

1766
01:19:09,786 --> 01:19:13,665
[Yeo-myung] I was trying, but he would
only give me one-word answers.

1767
01:19:13,749 --> 01:19:17,878
So I was wondering,
"Is he just not that into me?"

1768
01:19:18,462 --> 01:19:19,296
No!

1769
01:19:19,379 --> 01:19:20,547
-Oh, no!
-[Eun-ji] That's not…

1770
01:19:20,630 --> 01:19:21,965
Yeo-myung!

1771
01:19:22,799 --> 01:19:24,426
[Yeo-myung] So…

1772
01:19:24,509 --> 01:19:26,344
-A three-day trip to Japan.
-[laughs]

1773
01:19:27,471 --> 01:19:29,181
[Yeo-myung] I got a crush on Jeong-mok.

1774
01:19:29,264 --> 01:19:30,599
[Yeo-myung chuckles]

1775
01:19:31,558 --> 01:19:36,271
I was listening to him
and he was seriously so funny,

1776
01:19:36,354 --> 01:19:39,566
so I just started liking him
more and more. [chuckles]

1777
01:19:39,649 --> 01:19:41,651
[upbeat music playing]

1778
01:19:43,111 --> 01:19:44,863
My top pick right now…

1779
01:19:44,946 --> 01:19:45,864
[music fades]

1780
01:19:45,947 --> 01:19:47,240
Mmm…

1781
01:19:51,036 --> 01:19:51,912
Jeong-mok?

1782
01:19:51,995 --> 01:19:53,371
[dramatic music playing]

1783
01:19:53,455 --> 01:19:56,249
[Eun-ji] So much has changed
in just one night.

1784
01:19:56,333 --> 01:19:59,920
[Do] What should I do?
You think we're gonna have to compete?

1785
01:20:00,712 --> 01:20:02,255
[Jeong-mok] Wait. He also likes Yi Do?

1786
01:20:02,339 --> 01:20:04,800
-[Sang-ho] It's a game.
-[Seung-li] We're on different levels.

1787
01:20:05,509 --> 01:20:07,511
[Min-hong] You don't see me
as a rival, do you?

1788
01:20:07,594 --> 01:20:09,471
[Do] I think I can seduce him.

1789
01:20:09,554 --> 01:20:11,598
[Min-hong] If you don't ask him,
I'm taking him.

1790
01:20:11,681 --> 01:20:12,933
I feel like such a loser now.

1791
01:20:13,016 --> 01:20:15,268
-I need some advice.
-I feel like such a fucking loser.

1792
01:20:15,352 --> 01:20:16,853
-[Do] I wanna get married.
-I see.

1793
01:20:16,937 --> 01:20:19,397
If I ever have a daughter,
I want her to grow up like you.

1794
01:20:19,481 --> 01:20:21,483
How would you feel
if I was your girlfriend?

1795
01:20:21,566 --> 01:20:22,567
He's not backing down.

1796
01:20:22,651 --> 01:20:24,486
If you have a problem with that, go ahead.

1797
01:20:24,569 --> 01:20:26,613
I don't care. Really. Who cares?

1798
01:20:27,322 --> 01:20:29,324
[dramatic music continues]

1799
01:20:33,370 --> 01:20:34,746
[music fades]

1800
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:36,832
[upbeat music playing]
