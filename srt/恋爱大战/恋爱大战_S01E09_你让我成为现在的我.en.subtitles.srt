1
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,523
LOVE TO HATE YOU

2
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:53,636
Wait.

3
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:02,228
What?

4
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,232
I think this is too much.

5
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:08,401
What, having sex on day one?

6
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,946
No, having sex without even saying
so much as "I like you."

7
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,531
We said it earlier!

8
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,534
The one that comes after.

9
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:23,333
I love you.

10
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:27,921
You've never said it?

11
00:01:30,006 --> 00:01:31,674
-No.
-Not even once?

12
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,179
-No.
-It's okay.

13
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:38,473
You can say it later.

14
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:40,809
I'm always taking the lead with you.

15
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:44,521
Do I need to say it out loud?

16
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:45,605
You're such a dude.

17
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,090
This sealed the deal for me.

18
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:15,468
I fell for you
because you weren't like other women.

19
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:19,931
The women I knew were all manipulative,
selfish, and calculating.

20
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:24,352
But you were act-now-think-later,
foolish, and foolhardy.

21
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:25,687
"Foolhardy"?

22
00:02:26,187 --> 00:02:27,313
Courageous.

23
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:30,608
Frankly, I liked you even before that.

24
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:37,323
Then when was it?

25
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,075
When you threw the boomerang?

26
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:44,831
It's true that men are attracted
to unfamiliar women.

27
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:46,958
You were so unfamiliar.

28
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,335
You drove like a maniac.

29
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:52,005
You got beat up on your birthday.

30
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:55,633
And you risked your life
to save a stranger.

31
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:59,470
There are no strangers when saving lives.

32
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:03,266
Right. You're a hero who saves any life.

33
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:05,268
Wait, no.

34
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:07,979
A heroine, since you're a woman.

35
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,529
You can see I mean it, right?

36
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:26,748
How'd you come up with an answer
that even I couldn't have imagined?

37
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:28,708
It was amazing.

38
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:31,669
"Know your enemy and know yourself."

39
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,339
I'm not telling you to win against Mi-ran.

40
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:38,301
I just think it would be good for you
to know about her mom's book.

41
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:42,347
Mi-ran's father is extremely patriarchal,

42
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,767
and Mi-ran's mother suffered
a great deal of unfairness as a woman.

43
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:49,187
It's a huge plus
that my mom likes you, honey.

44
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:52,065
-And I don't care what my dad thinks.
-"Honey"?

45
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:54,984
-Yeah.
-Good. That was very natural.

46
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:52,417
EPISODE 9
YOU MADE ME WHO I AM

47
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:55,545
I think I'm going to cry.

48
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:57,839
What do I do?

49
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:59,966
It's all right. You're gonna be great.

50
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:03,511
Once the camera starts rolling,
you'll turn into movie star Oh Se-na.

51
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,347
I should've shot this before I saw them.

52
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:10,601
The image of him grabbing
that woman's hand and heading to his room,

53
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,270
I keep thinking about it.

54
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,731
This is driving me crazy too!

55
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,066
All right, then…

56
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:20,236
How about you use this emotion

57
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,864
and carry that right into the scene?

58
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,577
You know that this scene requires you
to portray a bit of sadness.

59
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:30,246
Just cry.

60
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,832
This will be your last kiss with Kang-ho.

61
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:35,918
The last kiss with a man
that you can never have.

62
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,296
Are you sure? I can't have him back?

63
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:41,716
I don't think
Mi-ran likes Kang-ho that much.

64
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:42,675
You're wrong.

65
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,345
They are both certain.

66
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:51,934
You wouldn't tell me the account number,
so I brought it.

67
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:52,894
No.

68
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:55,146
You really don't have to return it.

69
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:57,357
How will I keep seeing him
if I take this money?

70
00:05:58,358 --> 00:06:02,028
I was told not to use a single dime
because you never know what will happen.

71
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:03,696
Na-eun told me.

72
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:12,705
Hey.

73
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,165
Are you out of your mind?

74
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:18,378
You shouldn't forget that
no matter how distracted you are!

75
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:20,713
Kang-ho, Hyeok-su is on standby.

76
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:22,382
Oh, yes. Got it.

77
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:26,719
I'll say that you suddenly fell ill,
so pretend you're fainting.

78
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:27,929
Come on, drop down.

79
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:30,139
-No. I'm going to do it.
-Do what?

80
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:31,849
The kissing scene, that's what.

81
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:32,767
Huh?

82
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:34,769
I think I can do it.

83
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,139
Thank you.

84
00:07:56,976 --> 00:08:00,062
So you did take the medicine.
Why did you scare me like that?

85
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:01,731
I really didn't.

86
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,108
-Really?
-Yeah.

87
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:05,985
But it worked.

88
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:19,165
Oh, why do you ask something like that?

89
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:23,252
Of course, I know you're dating
none other than Nam Kang-ho.

90
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,505
But you've never fallen for a guy before.

91
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:29,008
So I'm curious
about what made you fall for him.

92
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:32,929
Was it his face, voice, body,

93
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,805
or technique?

94
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:38,684
Don't you dare say it was his personality.

95
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:42,772
His arm pillow.

96
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:46,442
He put his arm under my head in bed.

97
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,110
That's what made you fall for him?

98
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,028
Yeah.

99
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:53,366
-That's crazy!
-What?

100
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:56,410
Does this mean
there was a little girl inside you?

101
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:59,664
Finally, you're really in love.

102
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:04,418
Don't you just love this song?

103
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,754
-You like this song?
-Yeah.

104
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:13,052
It screams out for the whole world to hear

105
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:18,891
Why am I hearing it now?

106
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:24,647
For us to meet each other

107
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:28,651
"For us to meet each other."
Don't you love that part?

108
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:35,116
There is a chance of winning.
But for every lawsuit, it is 49 to 51.

109
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:39,495
So there's no need to sue first and pay
five million for the court deposit.

110
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,998
Let me know
what stance the other side takes.

111
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:46,877
NAM KANG-HO

112
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:49,880
-Yes?
-Did you have lunch?

113
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:50,923
Yes!

114
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:54,802
What did you eat?

115
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:56,637
Doenjang-jjigae!

116
00:09:57,388 --> 00:10:00,141
Oh, you had doenjang-jjigae?

117
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:05,688
Do I know how to be cute?

118
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:10,943
What time do you get off work?

119
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,781
My dad was rich, and my mom was poor.

120
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:18,618
He loved her, but I guess my mom
only cared about money.

121
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:25,207
We were a very happy family
until my mom took me to America.

122
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:28,377
But after my dad's business failed,
and we returned…

123
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:36,177
I've never seen my mom comfort my dad.

124
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,721
And my broke dad
was always treated like a sinner.

125
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:43,851
Then suddenly,
he passed away in a car accident,

126
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:46,562
and I had a stepdad
in less than two years.

127
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:47,897
He was very rich.

128
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:54,195
I swore that I'd never end up
with a woman like that,

129
00:10:54,278 --> 00:10:57,531
but I failed with my first love
in a similar way.

130
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:12,922
That must have been hard.

131
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,763
I also have something to tell you.

132
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:23,057
My most recent ex-boyfriend

133
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,518
is Lee Jin-suh, an attorney at the firm.

134
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,021
I had to look for a new firm to work at,

135
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,315
and the only place
that hired me was Gilmu.

136
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:35,111
I needed the money,
so I couldn't walk away.

137
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:40,074
Anyway, we're getting along fine
as just coworkers now.

138
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:40,991
Don't worry.

139
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,579
Yeah, well,
I'm also working with Oh Se-na.

140
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,873
We shot scene 94 yesterday.

141
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,126
Oh.

142
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,462
What? Do you know what that is?

143
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:57,299
I do. It's the motel scene.
I remember things like that.

144
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,635
I thought
those things wouldn't bother you.

145
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:00,720
I know.

146
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:04,974
Apparently, I can be cute and jealous too.

147
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:09,061
Oh, right. That was cute.

148
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,439
"Doenjang-jjigae."

149
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:13,566
Stop it.

150
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:14,859
"Doenjang-jjigae"?

151
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:17,361
Stop it!

152
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,113
-Why?
-Stop it!

153
00:12:19,196 --> 00:12:20,781
Don't do it!

154
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:23,492
Hey! I'm not doing it again!

155
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,744
Then say something else.

156
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:26,829
Kimchi-jjigae.

157
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,080
Hey!

158
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,290
"Hey"?

159
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:35,963
-Did that hurt?
-No.

160
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:37,298
I liked it.

161
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:38,799
My turn.

162
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:43,137
-This side too!
-Hey!

163
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:47,475
-Now the neck!
-No, don't!

164
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,062
Damn it! I'm going to bite you.

165
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:54,190
Bite me. Bite me all you want.

166
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:04,200
I have to go now.

167
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:08,412
I have to go to work tomorrow.

168
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:11,874
I have to go to work!

169
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:16,086
What's that?

170
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:27,348
You like me that much?

171
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:29,850
When do you get off work?

172
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:31,894
Aren't you tired?

173
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:39,068
Kang-ho, why don't you call in
and take a day off?

174
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:41,320
You look exhausted.

175
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:43,280
I'll get more tired if I try to rest.

176
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,491
I can't seem to rest.

177
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:58,254
There must be a beast inside me.

178
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:03,259
I want to see her all the time.

179
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,559
Now that they're dating,

180
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,978
I guess we'll run
into each other often, right?

181
00:14:14,645 --> 00:14:16,772
So I'm going to get this off my chest now.

182
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:20,442
Honestly, I was kind of falling for you.

183
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:23,195
But you're way out of my league,

184
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,698
and our getting together
will never happen.

185
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:30,202
So please help me get over you
and find my inner peace.

186
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,787
-You want my help?
-Yes.

187
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:35,082
All you need to do
is listen to what I have to say.

188
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:40,170
Once I reveal my shortcomings,
I think I'll stop trying to impress you.

189
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:45,467
First, I don't have a lot of money.
I have a bank loan of 50 million won.

190
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:48,304
I thought you were frugal.

191
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,806
When Mi-ran and I got our place,

192
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,601
I pooled all my savings
and was still 50 million short.

193
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:56,312
I have fewer flights, so less income.

194
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:00,482
I even had a guy swindle
all my savings once.

195
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:04,778
I lent money I never got back.
Three million one time, then five million

196
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:08,365
-A few smaller amounts of money too.
-You dated men like that?

197
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:11,118
Yes. I don't know how to pick decent men.

198
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:13,287
I like them if they are handsome.

199
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,707
I have a bad habit when I'm drunk.

200
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,459
I'd get drunk, call them,

201
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:21,462
and make a damn fuss,
whining about why they screwed me over.

202
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:23,923
You were heartbroken,
so that's understandable.

203
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:24,840
No.

204
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:27,635
I don't need such kind words from you.

205
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:30,512
Anyway, thank you for listening.

206
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:31,764
Farewell.

207
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:34,683
Whoa! Wait a minute!

208
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:37,770
Spilling all those embarrassing stories

209
00:15:38,395 --> 00:15:40,731
is making me feel bad!

210
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:41,815
Sit down.

211
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:45,527
I'm quite fussy myself.

212
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:47,696
If you hear my stories,

213
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:50,950
it might help you get over your feelings.

214
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:51,909
No.

215
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:55,746
Then we'd be on equal footing,
and I'd get my hopes back up.

216
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:58,290
I have to completely crush my hopes.

217
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:00,793
Jeez.

218
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,796
They say like attracts like.

219
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:06,590
You're just as much of an oddball
as Ms. Yeo.

220
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,217
Are you speaking ill of Mi-ran?

221
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,301
No way.

222
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,637
I just find you so interesting.

223
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:14,306
When I said "oddball,"
that was a compliment.

224
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:18,852
Well, then. I guess the four of us
going on trips and hanging out is now

225
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:20,187
not happening?

226
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,397
Probably?

227
00:16:22,856 --> 00:16:26,026
I mean, we can meet up briefly,
but trips would be too…

228
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,654
You can go with them.

229
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:30,406
And be the third wheel?

230
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:33,367
By myself? And be tactless?

231
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:36,120
Oh, I guess that's not good.

232
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:40,874
Why did you have to fall for me
and make this so boring? Jeez.

233
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:43,210
Did you think it'd be fun
if we all went together?

234
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,170
Yes.

235
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,006
No.

236
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:50,801
Stop saying things like that.
Thank you for sparing your time.

237
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:52,678
Have a nice day.

238
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:57,099
Jeez.

239
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,311
Why am I getting so pissed off?

240
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:04,940
Because the four of us can't hang out?

241
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:07,568
GILMU
LAW CORPORATION

242
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:09,486
Where did that file go?

243
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:17,870
Thank you.

244
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,706
Oh, coffee.

245
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:22,916
I'm going to get coffee.
Anybody want some?

246
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,298
Hey.

247
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:31,258
What's with her? I'm scared.

248
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:38,140
Do you want some?

249
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,309
People don't change,
and you can't change them.

250
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:42,728
But you seem so different.

251
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:44,605
You don't like it?

252
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,106
It's not that.

253
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,150
But it's a little creepy.

254
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:51,570
The other guys are also scared of you.

255
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,823
Do you want to grab a drink today?

256
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:58,494
It's all thanks to you, Soo-jin.
I owe you a nice meal.

257
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,120
So you're calling me Soo-jin now.

258
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:02,956
But do you think
buying me a meal is enough?

259
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:10,923
Where's mine?

260
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:12,466
What are you, a kid?

261
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,301
Do I look like your mom?

262
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,598
Go get your own glass and drink.

263
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,477
Did you have a bad day today?

264
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:29,358
It's not like I'm taking it out on you
because I had a bad day.

265
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:32,069
You should deal with your things yourself!

266
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:35,614
I don't have to act like a woman
for you anymore!

267
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:37,950
I hated romance shows more than you.

268
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:41,453
It drove me almost to the point of puking,
but I pulled through for you!

269
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,205
"Puking" is a little harsh.

270
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,958
Look how easily
you overcame that condition.

271
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:48,627
And you had me suffer all this time!

272
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:51,922
If you could pull off a kiss with Se-na,

273
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:54,925
you could do it with just about
every female actor, right?

274
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:56,093
I'm telling you.

275
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,053
It's such a mystery.

276
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:02,224
It still doesn't mean I find Se-na
or other women more likable.

277
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:05,185
But it feels like something
that was once frozen

278
00:19:05,936 --> 00:19:07,855
has been thawed.

279
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:10,065
Well, that must be
what being cured is like.

280
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:13,735
Are you happy?

281
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:15,320
Yeah.

282
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:16,405
Good.

283
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:19,825
That's a huge load off my shoulder,
thanks to this.

284
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,915
Huh? She's here already?

285
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:29,626
Who?

286
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:37,092
I'm sorry.

287
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:40,888
I came to this firm and made you
uncomfortable just so I could live.

288
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:42,306
I even took your client.

289
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,600
You didn't take my client.

290
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:48,020
Choi Soo-jin was already going to pick
someone else.

291
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:49,897
There are other things too.

292
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:53,525
I made you feel like you were nothing.

293
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:54,526
So you know.

294
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,529
"Someone like you means nothing to me."

295
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,990
"Men like you are a dime a dozen."

296
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:01,617
That feeling.

297
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,702
Did you do it on purpose?

298
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:07,998
I can't say it was totally unintentional.

299
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:10,250
But it wasn't just to you.

300
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:13,170
I know. All the guys that dated you
from our law school days…

301
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:18,550
Now that I think about it,
they were all two-timing cheaters.

302
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:21,637
I know that you were a two-timing,
three-timing cheater too.

303
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,514
Hey, did you date
those types of guys on purpose?

304
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:25,724
To punish them?

305
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:28,644
Cheating men are easier to seduce

306
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,647
and fun to hang out with,
and it feels good when I dump them.

307
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:35,067
Wow, I dated a terrifying woman.

308
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,819
So, you dated them
to break their hearts and punish them,

309
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:40,280
even though you didn't like them.
Is that possible?

310
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:43,992
Those guys thought of dating as a game,
so I played games with them.

311
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:48,288
"An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth."
I'm a big fan of that phrase.

312
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:52,000
Men tend to lack empathy,
so they have to learn through experience.

313
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,752
Then they realize what they've done.

314
00:20:53,835 --> 00:20:56,046
Are you doing the same thing
to Nam Kang-ho?

315
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:59,174
No.

316
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,842
A good person…

317
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,304
isn't someone who is just nice

318
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:07,474
but someone who changes others
into nice people.

319
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:09,434
Are you saying he is a good person?

320
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:10,852
I think so.

321
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,854
He's changing me into a nice person.

322
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:15,816
If you really want to repay me,

323
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:18,986
throw a really fun surprise party for me.

324
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:21,238
-A party?
-You're in a mess right now.

325
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:22,781
What do you mean "a party"?

326
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:25,867
That's why I'm asking him
to host the party.

327
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:27,911
Nam Kang-ho throws a party

328
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:30,580
and asks me to come,
and that's when I show up.

329
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:32,874
We did nothing for Christmas either.

330
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:36,545
It's just so depressing to pass the time
without any celebration.

331
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:42,217
Oh, can't you just stay quiet for a while?

332
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,680
Just stay depressed for a while!

333
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:51,393
I've seen you get angry plenty of times,
but I've never seen you get depressed.

334
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:53,770
It'll help with acting.

335
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:56,398
What is acting?
Is that more important than myself?

336
00:21:56,481 --> 00:21:58,150
What's up with him today?

337
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:03,363
I think he's stressed out because of me.
I've caused him a lot of trouble.

338
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:04,614
What's this?

339
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:06,533
You two have swapped roles.

340
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:11,079
Are you throwing tantrums
because Kang-ho is dating now?

341
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:15,208
And you're sitting here comforting him
instead of seeing Mi-ran?

342
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:17,210
No, she's meeting someone tonight.

343
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:25,344
You did some nice things
even when we dated.

344
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:29,556
You paid for expensive meals
and let me pay for cheap ones.

345
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,435
Let's go. I'll take you home.

346
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:34,353
Taxi!

347
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:39,816
That was the first time I ever went
to a hotel with another woman.

348
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,069
Damn it, stop lying.

349
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:44,071
You lie even when you're drunk.

350
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:47,199
-God, seriously.
-How did you know?

351
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:49,368
You're a psychic.

352
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:52,245
All right. I'm sorry!

353
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,916
Just forget about this lying bastard,

354
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,627
and have a nice life.

355
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:59,961
Where are you going?

356
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,173
Yeah, hello?

357
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:04,341
Are you still out?

358
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:07,928
Hey. Stand up, will you?

359
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:09,346
We can't get a cab that way!

360
00:23:09,429 --> 00:23:10,722
Let me talk to Lee Jin-suh.

361
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:13,809
He's in no shape to talk.
Don't worry. I'll get him home safely.

362
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:18,230
Just leave me here and go.
A grown man can go home by himself.

363
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:19,231
Where are you?

364
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,734
Something urgent came up.

365
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:25,821
Make yourself at home.
There are lots of drinks in the fridge.

366
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,785
I didn't know he was so my type.

367
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:34,454
He's completely down-to-earth.
I just love it.

368
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:39,209
You boys are ridiculous.

369
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:43,088
-Soo-jin.
-What?

370
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:46,258
What goes on in the mind of a woman

371
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:51,304
who rejects you when you haven't even
thought about asking her out?

372
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:56,643
Is she really trying to push you out,
or is it her way of saying she likes you?

373
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:58,186
Someone rejected you?

374
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,312
Yeah.

375
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:01,898
She said there's no chance
of us getting together.

376
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:03,984
I was just sitting there, you know?

377
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:06,403
-But she said that all by herself!
-Who is she?

378
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:08,864
You don't know her. We met recently.

379
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:11,908
So it's someone I don't know.

380
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:13,452
Yeah.

381
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:16,663
Wow, I'm so curious.

382
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:19,291
What kind of woman managed
to snag Do Won-jun's heart?

383
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:22,085
What?

384
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:25,505
You're annoyed because she's rejected you.

385
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:29,426
Just a moment, please.

386
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:32,471
Jin-suh.

387
00:24:32,554 --> 00:24:33,805
Let's go. The cab's here.

388
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,101
Huh? Wait!

389
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:40,854
-I'll report you for refusal of service!
-Report you!

390
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:42,147
Oh, this is killing me.

391
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:46,234
Huh? Why did you come?

392
00:24:46,735 --> 00:24:50,405
When I told you where we were,
I didn't mean for you to come here.

393
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:55,785
I'll hold him. Go and get a cab.

394
00:24:56,369 --> 00:24:57,370
Okay.

395
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:59,039
Oh, no. I'm okay.

396
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:01,500
Go.

397
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:03,543
Hello.

398
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:08,882
Impressive.

399
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:12,177
You're worrying about your ex-boyfriend
in front of your current one.

400
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:13,929
Are you mad?

401
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:16,723
Are you asking why I am mad
when there's no reason to be?

402
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:18,475
I don't mean that!

403
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:21,895
I'm staying out this late with my ex,
so you have a right to be mad.

404
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:25,857
I'm sorry. It won't happen again.

405
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,026
-What the…
-What are you doing?

406
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:29,027
Hey!

407
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:31,988
I'm okay!

408
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,787
Give me your address. Where do you live?

409
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:40,956
Hongeun-dong, Seodaemun-gu, Seoul…

410
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,874
That's my old address!

411
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:46,336
Your house is in Sadang-dong!

412
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:49,548
God, you still remember my address?

413
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:58,223
Hey, I'm really sorry,
but I think I have to take him home.

414
00:25:59,099 --> 00:26:01,351
He almost froze to death last winter.

415
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:03,478
Go and catch a cab.

416
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:04,854
Let's get you in. Whoa!

417
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:06,523
All right. Okay.

418
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:07,774
Ouch, damn it.

419
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:11,027
-You're going with us?
-Go home now, Ms. Yeo.

420
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:13,154
Hey…

421
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,951
He is mad.

422
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:25,208
If I never cheated on you,

423
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:28,503
would we still be together?

424
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:30,589
No.

425
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:32,007
Huh?

426
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:35,844
You're right.

427
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:40,515
You didn't go out with me
because you liked me in the first place.

428
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:43,643
You didn't like any of the guys you dated.

429
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:52,986
But still…

430
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,031
I really liked you.

431
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:02,829
Damn it!

432
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:03,747
Yeah.

433
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,208
I should congratulate you.

434
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:12,172
Mi-ran, you finally met a guy
that you truly like.

435
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:13,256
Be happy.

436
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:23,850
Well, I guess the four of us
going on trips and hanging out is now

437
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:24,934
not happening?

438
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:26,936
I mean, why can't we?

439
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:29,272
Even Mi-ran's dating Nam Kang-ho.

440
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:37,614
CEO DO WON-JUN

441
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:39,115
Why is he calling me? Why?

442
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,034
I thought I explained everything!

443
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:43,119
Why are you calling me?

444
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:47,415
Hello?

445
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,834
This is Do Won-jun.

446
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:52,170
Oh! Yes?

447
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:54,839
I want to ask you something.

448
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,925
I'm outside your place right now.

449
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:59,052
Are you not home?

450
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,055
Yes, I'm home.

451
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:06,434
Yes.

452
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:10,188
Maybe five minutes? No, three minutes?

453
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,369
What's wrong with him?

454
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:38,425
Something you can't ask over the phone?

455
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:43,596
You also rejected me in person
instead of doing it on the phone.

456
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:47,183
Well, that's because I had a lot to say.

457
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:48,643
What I'm about to ask you

458
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:52,147
will also leave you with a lot to say.

459
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:13,126
What is it that you want to ask?

460
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:16,212
Is there anyone you can't seem to get over

461
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,340
among all the men you've met?

462
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:22,886
Anyone you'd like to try
and get back with?

463
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:24,554
Do you have anyone?

464
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:26,681
No.

465
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:30,185
I'd try and stop any woman
from dating them.

466
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:33,354
I'd tell them not to be fooled
by their looks because they are jerks.

467
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:34,355
Right?

468
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,940
You got over all your exes,

469
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:38,985
so why would someone "out of your league"
like me be any different?

470
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:40,737
Don't you think so?

471
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:48,119
Oh, this is coming out all wrong again.
Damn it.

472
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:54,667
Okay. It is true
that I'm popular with the ladies.

473
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:58,379
But for you to think of me
like I'm on another level

474
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,966
and talk about who's out of whose league

475
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,468
made me uncomfortable.

476
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:06,429
I mean, there's nothing wrong with you.

477
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:07,931
What's your problem?

478
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:10,975
Are you here to yell at me,
not ask questions?

479
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:11,893
No.

480
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:14,145
That's not it.

481
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:18,107
I pleaded with you, didn't I?

482
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:21,861
Why did you come to my place
and say something sweet like that?

483
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:22,946
That was sweet?

484
00:30:23,613 --> 00:30:25,740
I didn't say that
to make myself look sweet.

485
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:26,783
Then what is it?

486
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:29,327
"Just go out with me.
There's nothing much."

487
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,829
So, are you asking me out?

488
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,913
Huh?

489
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:39,295
So, what I mean is that

490
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:43,424
you are a fine woman
who can date any great guy.

491
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:46,010
And I think you're being
too harsh on yourself.

492
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:49,097
The fact that you met those men

493
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:52,183
was all because you have a pure heart.

494
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:55,520
Being wary of men
because of your past experiences

495
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:59,274
will ultimately torment you the most.

496
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:02,068
Oh God.

497
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:04,654
-What's wrong with you?
-What about me?

498
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,031
Is the cat worried for the mouse?

499
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:11,536
This mouse will date another mouse,
so stop it already and just leave.

500
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,042
Was I being sweet again?

501
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:29,721
I'm sorry.

502
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:32,056
Why did you put yourself
through the trouble?

503
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,641
I could have taken care of it.

504
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,810
Were you always taking that dude home?

505
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:37,645
Yeah.

506
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:39,480
Once in a while.

507
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:41,733
On occasion.

508
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:46,863
So you did a lot.

509
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:49,991
Wow, you two are such a handful.

510
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:53,328
Now that you're here,
I have to take you home too!

511
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:56,122
You don't have to take me home!

512
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:57,790
I don't have to go.

513
00:31:57,874 --> 00:31:59,792
You're not going? What about work?

514
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:02,962
I have a scene to shoot tomorrow.
My last scene.

515
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,010
You're not mad now?

516
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:10,887
Is that because I'm sleeping over?

517
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,515
-I was never mad.
-Yeah?

518
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,809
Then I'll go home now. Good night.

519
00:32:18,227 --> 00:32:19,062
Hey!

520
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:20,480
"Hey"?

521
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:21,564
You little…

522
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:24,233
-Come here.
-You said you weren't mad!

523
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:26,194
Now that I know you're not, I'll go.

524
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:30,198
See? You're mad
that I'm not sleeping here.

525
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:32,617
Okay, fine. I'm mad!

526
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:37,664
What's the matter?

527
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:40,625
-Huh?
-Hey!

528
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:42,877
-Whoa!
-Damn it!

529
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,045
Wait--

530
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:47,382
Wait, hang on a second.

531
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:48,925
We have a shoot tomorrow!

532
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:49,968
I'll be quick.

533
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:51,427
What do you mean by that?

534
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:54,639
We have a shoot tomorrow!

535
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:56,641
Better tap out.

536
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:04,774
You scared me.

537
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:07,485
I said no.

538
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:12,782
Oh, okay. I give up!

539
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:16,661
I won't do it.

540
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:19,372
No, I won't do it. Let's just sleep.

541
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:21,165
I'm not an animal.

542
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,085
Let's just go to bed. Just sleep.

543
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:28,631
Oh, I won't do it. Let's just sleep.

544
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:33,177
I love you.

545
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:45,857
I said I love you.

546
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:50,588
Okay, this is the last scene!

547
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:53,049
Everyone, hang in there. Let's hurry!

548
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:04,871
You're not a killer.

549
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:06,330
I'll testify.

550
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:07,707
That you aren't the killer!

551
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,384
Not as thrilling as I thought.

552
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,055
It's like killing a bug.

553
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:50,458
I'm not dead.

554
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:52,710
Huh?

555
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:55,004
I think I'll survive.

556
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:38,256
Wow, good job!

557
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:46,472
Great work.

558
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:53,145
Here's to Shadow's success!

559
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:54,897
Cheers!

560
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,566
Good job. Great work, sir.

561
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:58,818
Good work.

562
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:00,319
Good job.

563
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:04,490
-Good work.
-Thank you.

564
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:06,158
-Good work.
-You too.

565
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:18,379
Who needs a light?

566
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,632
With our backs touching,

567
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:23,884
I'm going to kick him
in the back of his head.

568
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,177
No way!

569
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:26,429
You want to see it?

570
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:27,888
-Show us!
-Go ahead!

571
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,974
One, two, three!

572
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:45,156
You've done well. In everything.

573
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:49,410
You have something to say, right?

574
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:54,332
I don't know if there will be
another chance for me to hear you out.

575
00:38:55,249 --> 00:38:57,752
So tell me everything that's on your mind.

576
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:00,463
We're really over, huh?

577
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:05,843
-Not even the bad feelings are left.
-We were over a very long time ago.

578
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:07,678
It didn't end recently.

579
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:45,591
-Do you have tissues?
-You can blow your nose with this.

580
00:39:45,674 --> 00:39:47,968
No. Don't you have any tissues?

581
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:06,737
The old you

582
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:09,907
was nice to a fault.

583
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,785
That's why I took you lightly.

584
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:17,123
I thought you'd like me again
if I followed you around.

585
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:23,212
Won-jun told me
that I was the worst woman in your life.

586
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:26,966
Now I've become even worse than that.

587
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:29,301
That's not true.

588
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:32,471
You never took me lightly.

589
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:37,893
That's why you couldn't try
anything on me.

590
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:41,063
You just tried to look pitiful.

591
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:51,574
It's not like you only affected me
in a bad way.

592
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:56,704
I was so envious
after seeing you make it big.

593
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:59,832
That made me want to make it big too.

594
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:05,796
After my first title became a hit,

595
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:08,466
I was actually scared.

596
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:12,678
Because I suddenly had
unlimited opportunities.

597
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:17,224
I had to prove that my first success
wasn't just luck.

598
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:20,811
So I tried to be the best

599
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:24,148
in the next one
and the one after that too.

600
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:29,195
It was a really tough time for me.

601
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:35,367
But I had this feeling of emptiness.

602
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:39,997
Even when I was dating impressive men,

603
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:42,249
something felt missing.

604
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:47,046
I didn't know
it was love that I was missing.

605
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:50,716
And then I saw you on TV one day
and realized,

606
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:53,260
"Oh."

607
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:56,222
"I don't need more things.
I need to let go."

608
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:04,522
I thought I could let go of the compulsion
or obsession about success

609
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:08,442
and still feel peaceful if I was with you.

610
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:18,369
I really missed the old days.

611
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:22,122
Memories or yearnings aren't love.

612
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:27,711
Love is a person.

613
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:31,549
You'll find someone
who is just right for who you are now.

614
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:36,011
Introduce me to someone like that.

615
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:39,139
I'm hosting a party this weekend.

616
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:41,559
You can come and look for one.

617
00:42:42,142 --> 00:42:43,435
You're hosting a party?

618
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:44,937
You?!

619
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:48,440
A good friend of my girlfriend
asked me to.

620
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:51,026
You, a party?

621
00:42:56,949 --> 00:42:59,285
Come with me, please?

622
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:02,580
I don't want to.
I don't even have decent clothes to wear.

623
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:04,582
I'd look pathetic next to the actresses.

624
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:07,126
Why would you compete with the actresses?

625
00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:09,837
Just enjoy the food
and the sight of handsome actors.

626
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,548
Forget it. I'm sick of handsome men.

627
00:43:14,550 --> 00:43:16,093
Is it because of Do Won-jun?

628
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,470
Because he'd be mingling
with the actresses?

629
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:21,265
Why would I care
if he mingles with them or not?

630
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:23,559
Oh, stop bugging me and just go!

631
00:43:25,269 --> 00:43:26,687
Oh, jeez.

632
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:30,357
-Call me if you change your mind.
-Okay.

633
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:44,747
CEO DO WON-JUN
DELETE CONTACT

634
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:57,968
Have you been well?

635
00:43:58,052 --> 00:43:59,136
-Oh, yes.
-Of course.

636
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:01,472
Thank you for inviting us.

637
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:03,140
You're welcome. Thanks for coming.

638
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:04,850
-Enjoy the party.
-We will.

639
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:06,727
Oh, welcome!

640
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:10,522
How do you still look like a fairy
at your age?

641
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:14,360
Wow, did Nam Kang-ho
just compliment a female actor?

642
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:17,112
Look how you've changed.
You're even hosting a party.

643
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:20,324
We all change when we're in love.
Even more so once we're married.

644
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:22,201
One night!

645
00:44:23,535 --> 00:44:25,537
Wait, it's this. One night!

646
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:27,206
Two days!

647
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:28,624
Girlfriend?

648
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:30,876
Who? Is she here?

649
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:37,883
Wow, where did you learn to do this?

650
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:40,469
I had a friend who was a DJ.

651
00:44:40,552 --> 00:44:41,512
Ex-boyfriend?

652
00:44:41,595 --> 00:44:42,429
Yes.

653
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:44,223
Oh…

654
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:46,350
I'll keep it a secret from Kang-ho.

655
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:48,811
No need. He already knows.

656
00:44:48,894 --> 00:44:50,020
Just as I thought!

657
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:55,401
I saw you on TV.
Your singing is incredible.

658
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:59,071
I learned how to sing back then

659
00:44:59,154 --> 00:45:01,281
when you and I went
to karaoke all the time.

660
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:04,076
I would sing, and you would dance.

661
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:10,082
Man, I don't think I've ever gone
to karaoke since then.

662
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:13,252
Since we broke up, I haven't heard
anything about you dating a girl.

663
00:45:13,335 --> 00:45:14,503
I haven't dated since.

664
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:19,007
Why not? Can't find a girl you like?

665
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:22,261
I couldn't find one,

666
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:24,638
but now I did.

667
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:33,439
-Are there a lot of people?
-Yeah.

668
00:45:33,522 --> 00:45:36,191
-Lots of people.
-Wow, impressive.

669
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:37,568
I'm excited!

670
00:45:37,651 --> 00:45:40,904
Why don't you make your entrance now?
You're the guest of the night.

671
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:45,325
You look lonely.

672
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:48,912
A lonely-looking handsome man
is the deadliest thing, you know.

673
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:58,922
It's been a while. Have you been well?

674
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:05,345
You're on a hot streak these days.
Congratulations!

675
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:06,472
Thank you.

676
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:09,808
Hi.

677
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:14,146
Hi.

678
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:18,358
I heard you don't get along
with Nam Kang-ho.

679
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:22,154
You too. I heard you two didn't talk
at the wrap-up party.

680
00:46:22,237 --> 00:46:23,614
How have you been?

681
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:25,699
Great. How about you?

682
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:27,910
I didn't expect you
to invite us to this party.

683
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:29,661
Oh, thank you for coming.

684
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:33,123
I've been wanting to meet you
and apologize to you.

685
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:37,795
Hey!

686
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:42,382
I told you to stay out of my view.
You're breaking my concentration!

687
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:44,051
Hey, cut! Jeez.

688
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:45,135
I'm sorry.

689
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:47,179
If you're going to be a jerk,

690
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:49,723
you should at least act properly.

691
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:54,895
I apologize for back then.
I was rude and presumptuous.

692
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:58,023
I was really harsh to you too,
Ji-eun, wasn't I?

693
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:00,150
I'm really sorry.

694
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:02,444
I bought it for this show. It's a prop!

695
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:05,197
Other shows reimbursed me.

696
00:47:07,157 --> 00:47:07,991
Are you a bum?

697
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:10,202
What did you say?

698
00:47:10,285 --> 00:47:11,453
Let's have a drink later.

699
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:12,412
-Okay.
-Okay.

700
00:47:13,372 --> 00:47:14,289
What's up with him?

701
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:16,500
Is he dying?

702
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:20,462
Soo-jin. Why are you by yourself?

703
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:25,801
Did you see me come in?
I thought I was Moses parting the Red Sea.

704
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,554
Everyone moved aside to avoid me.

705
00:47:29,137 --> 00:47:31,723
I treated them
to so many meals and drinks.

706
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:35,602
But they all avoided me once they heard
the rumor that I had an affair.

707
00:47:36,728 --> 00:47:39,731
I thought there had to be a few
who'd be glad to see me

708
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:40,649
but look at them.

709
00:47:41,149 --> 00:47:44,862
They're all afraid to be seen
and be associated with me.

710
00:47:44,945 --> 00:47:47,739
This is the cold world we live in!

711
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:49,741
At least allow me…

712
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:53,287
You keep Mi-ran company.
She doesn't know anyone else.

713
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:56,915
Oh, I'm totally fine on my own.
Even better if someone's with me.

714
00:47:57,791 --> 00:48:01,628
Soo-jin, let's not sit here like this.
Let's go have some fun over there.

715
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:03,255
They have fun things.

716
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:04,882
Where?

717
00:48:05,632 --> 00:48:06,633
Just come with me!

718
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:09,720
Okay.

719
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:14,057
What, is it something bad?

720
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:16,143
Depending on how you take it,
it can be good.

721
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:18,437
Or it can be bad.

722
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:22,357
This long introduction makes me think
I won't like to hear it.

723
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:23,358
We should…

724
00:48:25,485 --> 00:48:26,737
stay good friends…

725
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:29,615
for life.

726
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:35,203
Is the emphasis on "for life"
or "friends"?

727
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:37,247
"Friends."

728
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:39,333
Are you seeing someone?

729
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:42,628
You said before that we should get married
if we are living like this

730
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:44,004
at the age of 40.

731
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:50,052
I don't want you to wait around for me
and waste your time.

732
00:48:50,135 --> 00:48:52,262
I'd rather hear you say you found someone.

733
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:54,932
If you're just saying this,

734
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:57,517
it means you don't want me to like you.

735
00:48:57,601 --> 00:48:58,852
If I didn't like you,

736
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:01,271
would I have hung out at your place?

737
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:03,732
And now you're acting this way

738
00:49:04,816 --> 00:49:06,026
because you do have someone.

739
00:49:07,611 --> 00:49:09,029
Okay, well,

740
00:49:09,988 --> 00:49:12,824
I wouldn't throw away
15 years of our friendship.

741
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:15,077
But I'm not sure
if we can remain good friends.

742
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:26,505
No!

743
00:49:29,049 --> 00:49:29,883
Soo-jin!

744
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:45,899
What is this?

745
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:53,615
Sang-sup, do you have a smoke?

746
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:55,742
Sir.

747
00:49:56,868 --> 00:49:58,203
Take a look at this.

748
00:50:07,212 --> 00:50:08,547
I knew it.

749
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:20,517
Look at this.

750
00:50:21,476 --> 00:50:24,813
SHOCKING LIFE OF NAM KANG-HO'S GIRLFRIEND!

751
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:33,071
Everyone knows her at this club.

752
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:34,781
She's a master at picking up men.

753
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:37,826
She even left the club
with a guy she picked up here

754
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:39,953
when she had a boyfriend.

755
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:43,457
She thinks nothing's wrong
with having one-night stands.

756
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:47,711
Some kind of a game?
That's what she thinks of them.

757
00:50:49,838 --> 00:50:53,425
When I first heard that his girlfriend
was a lawyer, I thought it could be her,

758
00:50:53,925 --> 00:50:54,760
but who knew?

759
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:58,889
Wow! If this is true,
it is really shocking!

760
00:50:58,972 --> 00:51:02,392
Would Nam Kang-ho have known this?

761
00:51:02,476 --> 00:51:05,479
Come on, who would knowingly date
a woman like her?

762
00:51:05,562 --> 00:51:07,397
But she's okay with a one-night stand?

763
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:11,735
Oh my God!

764
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:13,653
Wow, you're good.

765
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:15,363
-I did well, right?
-As I expected.

766
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:18,325
Huh?

767
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:20,911
It's Na-eun. Just a second.

768
00:51:30,837 --> 00:51:32,672
Don't you feel like something's off?

769
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:34,174
Yes.
