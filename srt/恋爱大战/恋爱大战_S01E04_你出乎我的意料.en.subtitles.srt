1
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,523
LOVE TO HATE YOU

2
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:38,371
Are you okay?

3
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,206
I'm sorry!

4
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,545
Do you not like me anymore?

5
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:47,881
What?

6
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:55,930
Don't you like me anymore?

7
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:04,022
Oh, that's different.
A job is a job, you know.

8
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:05,774
You asked me to fight you.

9
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,072
Sit down for a second.

10
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:18,203
Where have you been fighting like this?

11
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:20,121
I haven't been fighting.

12
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:24,000
As a lawyer, I also had to catch crooks
and deal with punks.

13
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:28,254
That's why it didn't feel so classy.

14
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:31,758
There are no classy fights.
They are all dogfights.

15
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:34,886
So I like it. I love dogfights.

16
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:37,388
A classless style
that you can't learn anywhere.

17
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:39,641
I need that style myself.

18
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:42,685
So, are you interested
in doing stunts as a side job?

19
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,396
-Huh?
-You don't have to humor me.

20
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,816
Just like when you're catching a punk,

21
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:49,484
you can kick and punch.

22
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:50,485
Anyway.

23
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:54,614
If you become my sparring partner,
I'll pay as much as you want.

24
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:58,493
What a jackpot!

25
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,038
Getting paid for beating up a guy I hate?

26
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:04,457
That sounds fun.

27
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:10,255
You can't take photos.

28
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,883
Hey, I would never take photos
without permission.

29
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:16,553
But you trip people?

30
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:19,556
You accepted my apology.
Why keep bringing it up?

31
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:22,559
Are you giving me this job
to hit me because you're still mad?

32
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:24,102
Not really.

33
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,605
How imaginative for a lawyer.

34
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,829
I bet you don't get swindled
since you're a lawyer.

35
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:44,789
If you look out for men, you're safe.

36
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:46,708
Because 80% of convicts are men.

37
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:55,884
So I got into the tiger cave…

38
00:02:58,219 --> 00:02:59,554
Install a hacking app?

39
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:01,181
No, that's not it.

40
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:04,184
I have to get the girl's number first.

41
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:12,150
The top part is the standard contract.

42
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:14,569
You only need to check
the bottom and page two.

43
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:18,531
I added 10,000 won for hazard pay
on top of the average consultation fee.

44
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,742
Ten thousand? That's too little.

45
00:03:20,825 --> 00:03:21,743
Make it 50,000 won.

46
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:23,828
Do you mean 50,000 per hour?

47
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:26,998
That way, I won't feel so guilty
about hitting a woman.

48
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:29,209
Well, if you insist.

49
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:33,880
"Costs for any injuries
are to be paid by the injured"?

50
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:37,133
Why is that?
Isn't that the employer's responsibility?

51
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:41,221
What if I pretend to be hurt
and scam you out of a lot of money?

52
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:44,974
I might be a party to a contract,
but I'm your lawyer at the same time.

53
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,060
I left out any unfavorable terms.

54
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:49,979
I heard that having multiple personas
is a trend these days.

55
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,898
You're good at separating your personas.

56
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:54,192
There's no need to separate my persona.

57
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:57,487
The side gig will eventually end,
but I'll be a lawyer until I die.

58
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,405
So that persona matters more.

59
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:06,955
Is there anything you want to modify?

60
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:10,208
No, I just thought
you were a competent lawyer.

61
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:11,542
Thanks!

62
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:13,044
I'm sorry.

63
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:16,089
I was too harsh to a fan of mine.

64
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:19,175
I can only make a living
thanks to my fans, including you.

65
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:21,928
No, it's fine.

66
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:24,264
What I did was wrong, so I deserved that.

67
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:28,768
I look forward to working with you.

68
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,312
My attorney and…

69
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:34,107
my master.

70
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:36,776
Me too.

71
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:38,945
You are so busted!

72
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,532
EPISODE 4
YOU ARE NOT WHAT I EXPECTED

73
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:43,616
It hurts.

74
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:45,994
GILMU LAW CORPORATION

75
00:04:46,077 --> 00:04:47,704
A sparring partner?

76
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,038
I'll tell you how it happened.

77
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,957
When his fans got into a fight,

78
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,917
I showed off some of my skills.

79
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,127
Behold!

80
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:03,469
That's nothing.

81
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,725
I assured him

82
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,811
that I was good at this,
and I could be his bodyguard!

83
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:12,937
You seduced him.

84
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,149
-What?
-When your job's done, you should go.

85
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:18,901
Don't put on a show.

86
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:23,364
Jeez, he hired a female lawyer
and not a martial arts director?

87
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:26,034
Wow, you two are a great match!

88
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:28,328
Sir!

89
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:31,664
I only said yes because you told me
to do as I was told.

90
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,333
I won't do it if you don't like it.

91
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,876
Nam Kang-ho asked you.

92
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:38,171
You already said yes.
Now you're going to back out?

93
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:42,633
Just get your head on straight.

94
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:46,721
I don't know about him crossing the line,
but don't you cross it first.

95
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:51,434
The penalty's three times your salary
if you leak details of a celebrity's life

96
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:54,145
and cause trouble
by becoming a part of it.

97
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:57,106
-"Trouble"?
-I'm talking about scandals!

98
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:01,694
I wouldn't worry if you were ugly,
but you're pretty.

99
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:06,407
Should there be any trouble,
the firm will have to take Nam's side,

100
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:10,495
which means you'll get fired
if he feels uncomfortable.

101
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:12,497
Got that?

102
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,082
Yes, sir.

103
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,896
A trained man, indeed.

104
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:41,150
Kang-ho's been practicing constantly.

105
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:43,820
He's a well-prepared action star.

106
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:48,783
His moves scream
Seoul National University.

107
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,202
Or elite special forces.

108
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:53,079
Or the Presidential Security Service.

109
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:54,997
What we need is an untrained fighter,

110
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:57,917
someone from the back alleys.

111
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:00,211
Man, this isn't it.

112
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:01,963
Even he knows it too.

113
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:02,880
Mr. Yoo.

114
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:05,383
Give me some time. I'll meet you later.

115
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:07,927
You should keep trying here,
listening to my feedback.

116
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:11,347
I won't be practicing alone.
I have a punk who will help me.

117
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,016
Hey, you let her into your house?

118
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:16,310
Are you out of your mind?

119
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,896
I mean, how well can a girl fight anyway?

120
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,398
She's no joke.

121
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:22,525
She almost beat me up.

122
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,485
What the hell are you saying?

123
00:07:24,569 --> 00:07:25,778
Hey.

124
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:29,949
It's possible that she planted a bug
or a recorder in your house.

125
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:31,325
-Did you check?
-She didn't.

126
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:32,994
She only came because I called.

127
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:34,912
She had no time to prepare that stuff.

128
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:37,748
A lawyer wouldn't
do anything illegal, right?

129
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,334
I'll tell you what's going on.

130
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:43,337
It's a problem
whether she's a fan or an anti-fan.

131
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,840
Misery if she's a fan.

132
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,592
More Misery if she's an anti-fan.

133
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,595
And an anti-fan is likely
to be more persistent.

134
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:53,639
-An anti-fan?
-She tripped you!

135
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:55,057
And you fell on the floor!

136
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,642
You said it was on purpose.

137
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,728
Think about it, man.

138
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:02,023
Would you trip a guy you hate
or a guy you like?

139
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:04,358
Let's say she tripped you
because she likes you.

140
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:06,277
Then she must be crazy.

141
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,445
A mad lawyer.

142
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:21,876
-What was that?
-Sick!

143
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,886
Na-eun, should I set records
on all the machines here?

144
00:08:31,969 --> 00:08:34,180
-You have a target, right?
-Huh?

145
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:37,975
Now that you have a job and some money,
are you going to compensate your victims?

146
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:41,812
That punch will cause
four-weeks worth of injury at least.

147
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:44,774
-That's four million for having a fit.
-Wow, you're a pro now.

148
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,318
You know how to diagnose patients
and about settlement money.

149
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,111
Who is it?

150
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,197
I don't have a target.

151
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,448
Tell me who.

152
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,533
Is it Nam Kang-ho?

153
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:56,744
-What, are you psychic?
-What do you mean?

154
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:58,829
I mean, you were dissing him and--

155
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:01,207
Why would you beat him up?

156
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:05,378
I'm going to be his sparring partner.
Keep it a secret. It's confidential.

157
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:08,839
If his private life is leaked,
I'll pay the penalty and get fired,

158
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,218
and we will be broke. So it's all on you.

159
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:15,555
But he has a director.
Why would he ask a girl?

160
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,515
No, why you?

161
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:19,725
He knows a thing about fights.

162
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,895
-I think he recognizes a master.
-No.

163
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,523
Nam Kang-ho is an actor.

164
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:27,316
And a great one at that.

165
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,278
He made up an excuse to see you
because he's into you.

166
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:33,531
He baited you with a high-paying gig,
and you took the bait!

167
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,117
That's so romantic.

168
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,703
I can see you grabbing him,
getting down on the floor,

169
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:40,788
and smelling each other's sweat,
all tangled up!

170
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:43,207
I'm not Harley Quinn!

171
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:49,714
I forgot how pretty you are.

172
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:52,550
-What's wrong with you?
-I fell for your looks, you know.

173
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,970
When a star sees a pretty girl
who's not a celebrity,

174
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:58,306
it's got to be
more impressive to him, right?

175
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:01,559
If I end up seducing him, I'll think

176
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:04,770
about how to destroy the life
of a misogynistic pervert.

177
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:07,773
"Pervert"? What are you talking about?

178
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:11,485
You know me. I always doubt men.

179
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,738
I really hope you fall in love someday.

180
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:17,241
I've met ten times more men than you.

181
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:20,453
You only met guys similar to you.
Those who only like to have sex.

182
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:21,704
Yeah, but still!

183
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:24,290
At least
I didn't get betrayed by them like you.

184
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:26,208
They used you for your money.
Love tricks you.

185
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:29,128
If you get played one more time,
I'll kill the bastard.

186
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:31,881
Keep showing off,
and you'll be hooked before you know it.

187
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,966
Because Nam Kang-ho
is strikingly handsome.

188
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,969
I don't fall for pretty faces like you do.

189
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:51,734
Yes, Mr. Ko.

190
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,319
I'm at the office.

191
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:56,489
Okay.

192
00:10:56,572 --> 00:11:00,201
A top actress by the name of C
is about to go through a divorce.

193
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:02,536
A top actress who is married.

194
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:06,123
It must be the one who kept acting
after she married a chaebol man.

195
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:08,042
-Am I right?
-Yes.

196
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,711
She also took part
in a successful drama that just ended.

197
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:11,796
She even got an award.

198
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:14,131
I heard
they're breaking up over an affair.

199
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,257
Is that right?

200
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:18,094
Yes, but unlike most cases,
it's not the chaebol who cheated.

201
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,178
It's the actress.

202
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:25,518
Oh God.

203
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:29,146
Sorry. I'll get you a new one.

204
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,899
No, you don't have to. It's okay.

205
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,069
He's the one who cheated.
That son of a bitch!

206
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:37,822
Hey, please calm down.

207
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:39,532
First,

208
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:42,952
we will sue them for defamation
and spreading false information.

209
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:46,789
I'm sure that will negatively impact them
in the divorce lawsuit, okay?

210
00:11:46,872 --> 00:11:48,457
Your gentle approach takes forever.

211
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:52,378
I can try to be nice
and talk my way through this,

212
00:11:52,461 --> 00:11:56,215
but if he grabs me by my hair,
I have to fight the same way!

213
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:57,800
The girl he's seeing.

214
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:00,469
I'll disclose what she looks like
and everything!

215
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:03,055
Soo-jin, just calm down.

216
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,644
All we have to do is announce
that we'll take legal action

217
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,312
and stay quiet.

218
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:14,316
Without any proof,
the public won't believe it.

219
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,318
And if we find out
the source of the rumor,

220
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,820
that's their loss in the court.

221
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:22,241
Attorney Yeo Mi-ran
will be doing her best,

222
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:23,492
so don't worry too much.

223
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:27,163
Okay. Please take good care of this.

224
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,914
About Ms. Yeo Mi-ran,

225
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,460
I'd like you to take her off
Kang-ho's assignment.

226
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:37,882
I thought Mr. Nam approved of her.

227
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:39,300
Yes, that's true,

228
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:40,968
but you know Kang-ho.

229
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:43,387
How he gets into trouble
whenever he's around women.

230
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:48,893
And on top of that,
I personally find her quite unsettling.

231
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:51,353
I mean, she was hired as Soo-jin's lawyer.

232
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:54,273
It's weird that
she's volunteering to work for Kang-ho.

233
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:56,609
And now she's Kang-ho's sparring partner?

234
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:58,611
Hey! Do Won-jun!

235
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:01,781
I'm the one who hired her.

236
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:04,283
Did you just use "unsettling"
to describe someone I hired?

237
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:07,620
Do you think I'm a poor judge of character
and picked the wrong person?

238
00:13:07,703 --> 00:13:10,289
Are you screwing me over?

239
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:11,791
Soo-jin, that's not what I--

240
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:15,586
Yeah, I'm a poor judge of character.
That's why my marriage failed.

241
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:19,924
That's why I refused all the sweet offers
and worked for you for ten years!

242
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:21,717
All right. Mr. Ko.

243
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:24,637
Please pretend
you didn't hear what I just said.

244
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,223
Yes. I'll call you back.

245
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:29,099
Okay. Take care.

246
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,231
Do well.

247
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:38,025
Yes, sir.

248
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:42,321
Is Kang-ho all you ever think about?
Am I nothing to you?

249
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:45,783
How can you talk about that now?

250
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:47,034
Okay.

251
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:48,619
I'm sorry.

252
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:50,830
I did wrong. I'm really sorry.

253
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:53,541
I was inconsiderate.

254
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:56,335
Please don't be upset.

255
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:00,756
I'm truly sorry, Soo-jin.

256
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,801
It's not fair
for you to apologize like this!

257
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:06,554
Hey, you're not mad anymore.

258
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:09,640
Okay.

259
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:11,725
I'll be very careful from now on.

260
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,853
-Okay?
-I feel like crying.

261
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:36,750
Give me a hug too.

262
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,752
-What?
-I'm serious.

263
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:41,380
I did something good, so give me a hug.

264
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,678
Oh God!

265
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:51,390
-What is it?
-We have the female lead.

266
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:53,142
Really? Who is it?

267
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:54,143
Oh Se-na.

268
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:56,312
She kept saying she'd think about it,

269
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:59,481
but then she accepted it
as soon as I told her about Kang-ho.

270
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:05,070
If it's about the female lead,

271
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:07,573
shouldn't you have discussed it with us?

272
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:09,992
What's the matter?
I thought you'd be thrilled.

273
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,286
Do you not like her?

274
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:14,246
The director likes her a lot.

275
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,415
No, it's not like that.

276
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,345
Ma'am.

277
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:32,097
Your guest just called
to say that he won't be coming.

278
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:34,850
Would you like to order?

279
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,396
No. I'll be leaving shortly.

280
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,648
Yes, ma'am.

281
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,242
Oh, sorry! Something urgent came up.

282
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:57,164
Is this your way of saying
that you've been toying with me?

283
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:59,333
Come on, what are you talking about?

284
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:02,044
I can't be there, but my card is.

285
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:04,964
Call your friends,
and eat something good, okay?

286
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:07,299
Do chaebols think
the rest of the world is broke?

287
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:11,845
I came here to break up with you anyway.

288
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:14,306
It's nice and neat
to end it in such a messy way.

289
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,517
I'll leave all the stuff
I got from you here.

290
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,603
So drop by later, or send someone.

291
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:04,857
Kang-ho, I'm sorry.

292
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,694
You won't tell anyone

293
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:12,072
that we once dated, will you?

294
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,034
Get rid of all the photos

295
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,453
that we took together.

296
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:19,621
Please.

297
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,421
Is she out of her mind?

298
00:17:27,504 --> 00:17:28,630
Stalker?

299
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:32,176
How can she report you for stalking
just to break up with you?

300
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:33,594
Se-na didn't do it.

301
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:36,346
It was her manager.

302
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,932
She should've stopped her manager,
but she did nothing!

303
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:42,811
Kang-ho.

304
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,189
Become a star like her,

305
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:46,857
and make her pay.

306
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:50,110
No. You can do that right now.

307
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:53,155
"Oh Se-na dates a stage actor
from Seoul National University."

308
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:54,656
That will finish her.

309
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,283
-I will blow it wide open.
-Hey.

310
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:57,201
Come on, man!

311
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:59,703
I'm saying this all for you!

312
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:01,914
And that's the truth.

313
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,835
Fine. I won't do it.

314
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:08,629
And no matter what,

315
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,799
you shouldn't get famous for dating her.

316
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:14,593
You have to make it on your own.

317
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:16,011
You've got what it takes.

318
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:19,014
Are you crying?

319
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,767
Hey, are you crying?

320
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:07,229
Hello?

321
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:08,939
It's been a while, Ms. Oh.

322
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:10,482
This is Do Won-jun.

323
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:14,695
It's been a while.

324
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:16,363
Could I see you?

325
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,825
I've been meaning to see you too.

326
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:28,500
You know I hate that soup.

327
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,919
I can eat what I want on my birthday.
Why force me?

328
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,921
What do you want, then?

329
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:35,757
I'll leave it at your place.
Have it for breakfast tomorrow.

330
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,676
I don't have time to eat at home.

331
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:40,345
Enjoy your day.
You had it rough giving birth to me.

332
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:42,097
-Jeez.
-Go shopping.

333
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,056
Are you that busy?

334
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:46,393
Don't you think your new job
is pushing you too hard?

335
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,771
I'm getting a call. Bye, Mom.

336
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:53,775
-Yes, Mr. Ko.
-Yeo.

337
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:54,693
It's go time.

338
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,529
-"Go time"?
-Jeongha Detention Center.

339
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:01,116
The Sudden Witch suddenly drove her car
into her husband's car.

340
00:20:04,494 --> 00:20:07,664
She married a chaebol,
so she's gotta be in Room 10 or under.

341
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:10,959
Checking into a VIP room
as soon as you arrive?

342
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:11,960
You're very lucky.

343
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:15,214
The first ten rooms in the lockup
are for VIPs only.

344
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,009
Has anyone been in a VIP room?

345
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:21,929
I've been to Room 3
when I was at my old law firm.

346
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,222
Three?

347
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,725
You're only called to be a gofer anyway.

348
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,810
"Want a massage? Are you hungry?"

349
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,187
"What should I order?"

350
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,397
I stuffed myself all day with hanjeongsik

351
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:34,816
and Chinese food.
I thought I was at a hotel.

352
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:39,571
Because Rooms 1, 2, and 3 are for VVIPs.

353
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:44,743
So, what happened to your VIP?

354
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:47,621
Serving time right now, right?

355
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:49,039
And Attorney Seo, who got fired,

356
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:51,583
is here now.

357
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:54,795
I'm leaving.

358
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:56,713
It was still a wise experience…

359
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,465
Hey, I'll get you a cab.

360
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:02,386
What was that? Are they still together?

361
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:04,972
Can't you see what's going on?

362
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:07,140
Jin-suh is holding onto her.

363
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:09,393
It's ridiculous
that he thinks she likes him.

364
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:10,936
Still, they are both chill.

365
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:13,522
Can exes be like that
in the same workplace?

366
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:15,983
Well, yeah.

367
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:18,527
I once dated
my ex-girlfriend's girlfriend.

368
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,283
-What a scumbag.
-Scumbag.

369
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,452
There's no middle ground for Choi.

370
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,663
She feels either really happy
or really crappy.

371
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:31,248
And we suffer regardless.

372
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:36,545
You'll feel shitty after it ends.
Call me if you need a drink.

373
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:38,755
-I'll stand by.
-Don't.

374
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:41,675
I'm already grateful
that we're getting along as coworkers.

375
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:43,260
Hey.

376
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:45,804
Any plans for your birthday?

377
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:49,057
Oh, I'll be with a guy.

378
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:50,642
Bye.

379
00:21:57,482 --> 00:22:01,695
Why did you have to come here
and make me feel things for you again?

380
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:04,239
God, you crazy bastard.

381
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,782
Forget about her!

382
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:08,285
When I was going in,
she was coming out of the hotel

383
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:10,037
with a guy she just met!

384
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:19,796
I'm surprised
at how easy it is to meet with you.

385
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:23,467
I think I called you
more than a hundred times back then.

386
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,761
I was sorry. To you too.

387
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,722
I don't mean to rehash
what happened more than ten years ago.

388
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:31,308
Let's skip the small talk
and get to the point.

389
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:33,185
Why did you choose to do this film?

390
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,020
What did Kang-ho say?

391
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:38,648
I just had an absurd idea.

392
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:39,566
You're not…

393
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,945
doing this to get back with Kang-ho,

394
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:46,948
are you?

395
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,534
You have a rich boyfriend.

396
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:52,662
I broke up with him.

397
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:53,997
You must be crazy.

398
00:22:57,125 --> 00:23:00,629
Did you really choose this film
to get back with Kang-ho?

399
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:04,841
Are you for real?

400
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:06,593
It's been hard for me too.

401
00:23:07,177 --> 00:23:08,512
At awards shows,

402
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:11,598
I tried not to be seen
because I might upset him.

403
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:17,813
I want to apologize.

404
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:21,191
I've always wanted to,

405
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:23,110
but I didn't have the courage.

406
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:30,826
And all this time went by.

407
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,497
Didn't have the courage?

408
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,084
Yeah, well.

409
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,422
Then this is the time to find courage.

410
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:46,758
If you really wish
to apologize to Kang-ho,

411
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,260
find the courage

412
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,097
and drop out of the film.

413
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:57,686
One of you will have to be blamed
for dropping out,

414
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:58,770
so it should be you.

415
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:02,691
If you still insist
on apologizing after that,

416
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,192
you can meet Kang-ho.

417
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:06,153
I'll set you up.

418
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:11,616
But if I apologize to Kang-ho

419
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:14,870
and tell him I'll drop out,

420
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:17,956
will he shoot the film?

421
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,374
What?

422
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:22,711
That will make up for the bad things
I have done to him,

423
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:27,257
and Kang-ho will have to forgive me
because he wants this movie badly.

424
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:31,094
Is he the kind of person
to let that happen?

425
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:35,724
So this is your way of saying
you won't drop out.

426
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:38,560
You've got to be kidding me.

427
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,897
Wow, you're really something.

428
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:44,983
No wonder.

429
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:49,946
You have the audacity to make a pass
at Kang-ho after all this time.

430
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:50,906
Won-jun.

431
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,825
I think you're speaking

432
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:56,036
a bit too harshly.

433
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:56,953
Me?

434
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:00,957
Kang-ho might be harsher than me.

435
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,419
Do you think he will accept your apology,

436
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:07,464
talk to you about the good old days,
and have a laugh about it?

437
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,342
That's never going to happen.

438
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:12,761
Do you know why?

439
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:17,807
You are the worst woman in his life.

440
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:25,065
JEONGHA DETENTION CENTER

441
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,779
You can head to Room 1.

442
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:32,405
-"Room 1"?
-Yes.

443
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:35,742
Thank you!

444
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:39,621
What did Won-jun tell you?

445
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:41,456
Did he tell you to scold me?

446
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:46,169
Only Mr. Ko had a phone call with him
and not me.

447
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:49,673
Mr. Do finds me unsettling, you know.

448
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:51,675
How do you know that?

449
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:53,760
I heard it on speakerphone.

450
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:56,346
-Oh dear.
-Thank you for defending me.

451
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:00,517
Don't mention it.
And don't worry too much.

452
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,645
It's because Kang-ho's had
so much trouble with women.

453
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:04,563
Okay.

454
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:07,399
To get out of here,
you can say you're sick,

455
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:09,317
you have family members to take care of,

456
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,403
you're not a flight risk
with a clean background,

457
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:13,989
or you can pay a deposit
for the other party's injury--

458
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:15,574
Take your time.

459
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:18,034
You'll be spending the whole day here.

460
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:21,913
-Shall we eat something good?
-Huh?

461
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:26,960
I would have divorced him anyway.

462
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:29,170
I got sick of him
after a year of marriage.

463
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:32,549
Did you think chaebols fight
over big things?

464
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:34,217
It started with small things.

465
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:35,969
We fought just after we got married

466
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:39,055
because of
my mother-in-law's friend's wedding.

467
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:41,391
She said, "Go and eat,"

468
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:43,435
and handed me an envelope of money.

469
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:46,229
Then she went on a trip.
Isn't that an errand?

470
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:50,400
If so, she should've checked my schedule
and asked if I could go, right?

471
00:26:50,483 --> 00:26:52,736
Yes! It's not like
she gave you meal vouchers.

472
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:56,531
My husband and I argued.
He had work, so I went alone.

473
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:59,117
I had to cancel my plans with friends!

474
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,201
So annoying!

475
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:03,830
Now I have to talk about it
and eat these without sake.

476
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:07,334
Bring soju in a water bottle next time.

477
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:10,754
-What?
-And don't just bring one bottle.

478
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:12,464
Oh, okay!

479
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:13,965
Go on, eat.

480
00:27:15,925 --> 00:27:17,093
I can't eat without soju.

481
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:21,806
Death

482
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,352
is feared by everyone.

483
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,521
I'm seriously scared to death!

484
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:30,482
You're scared?

485
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,401
Don't I look like a punk?

486
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:37,072
Take those sunglasses off,
or I'm going to quit.

487
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:40,575
You don't seem like the type
to get scared so easily.

488
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:45,038
I've got great night vision.

489
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:46,790
Whatever.

490
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:50,251
You're banned from driving
until the film is finished.

491
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:52,587
Hey, I always take driving seriously.

492
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:55,256
I'm afraid I might kill someone,
not because I might die.

493
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:59,260
My father died in a car accident.

494
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:03,264
Oh, did he?

495
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:06,518
But now I have no regrets.

496
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:09,521
Director Yoo Sung-jun's noir film.

497
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:11,856
I don't care if I die now.

498
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:16,653
I met Oh Se-na.

499
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,447
She was chosen as the female lead.

500
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:20,573
What?

501
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:23,910
It appears that the director
has been reaching out to her,

502
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:26,162
but she didn't give him an answer.

503
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,707
Then she heard you're the lead.

504
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,376
-That's when she accepted the role.
-Why?

505
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:33,962
-I think she still likes you.
-What?

506
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:37,716
Hey, are you okay?

507
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:45,056
I'll try to stop her one more time.

508
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:49,561
-If I fail, let's sit this one out.
-Why should I do that because of her?

509
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:54,441
You're still young.

510
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,945
You'll get more offers like this.

511
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:07,829
I'm sorry.

512
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:10,915
We'll have to practice tomorrow afternoon.

513
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,417
Something came up at work.

514
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:15,253
Don't you like me anymore?

515
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:21,050
That's different.
A job is a job, you know.

516
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:23,261
Kang-ho.

517
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:26,097
If you ever want to work
with Director Yoo in the future,

518
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:29,726
we have to act fast
and wrap this up nicely.

519
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:31,269
No.

520
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,355
-I'll do it.
-What?

521
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,398
It's work.

522
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:37,233
I can do it if it's work.

523
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:48,244
-Thank you.
-Sure.

524
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,549
You brought kaoliang?

525
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,219
Good call. I picked the right person.

526
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:09,224
Anyway, my husband and his family
aren't the only problems.

527
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:10,183
It's everything.

528
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:14,062
Do you know what a reporter asked
after my wedding announcement?

529
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:17,857
"Are you going to keep working
after you get married"?

530
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:20,443
"What is your priority? Work or family"?

531
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:24,531
Do you ask men that too?

532
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:27,367
You're right!
Are we working for fun or what?

533
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:28,451
When I was a newlywed,

534
00:30:28,535 --> 00:30:30,954
they asked,
"Do you make breakfast for your husband?"

535
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:32,997
"How would you rate your cooking skills?"

536
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:34,040
Wow, I'm pissed off.

537
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:37,293
I hate watching
those married couple reality shows.

538
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:40,088
When a husband drinks
and comes home late, it's funny.

539
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:42,715
But why is it so serious
when a wife does the same?

540
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,718
-They get experts to provide solutions!
-That's what I'm saying!

541
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:48,179
We click so well!

542
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:50,056
Let's be like sisters. What do you say?

543
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,474
What?

544
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,477
-Or not.
-Oh, yes.

545
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:56,646
-I'd like to, Soo-jin.
-You don't have to.

546
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:58,314
No, I'd love to do that!

547
00:30:58,398 --> 00:30:59,232
Soo-jin!

548
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:01,693
Soo-jin?

549
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:03,778
What should we eat next time?

550
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,280
How about jokbal and bossam?

551
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:09,117
Deal!

552
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,452
She's not so bad.

553
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:12,620
Pour me a glass.

554
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:14,956
Ma'am.

555
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:17,166
Ma'am?

556
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:19,294
Ma'am!

557
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,213
Hey!

558
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:25,800
We arrived!

559
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:30,680
Oh, I'm sorry!

560
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:33,224
I ate too much and got drowsy.

561
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:35,685
You're drooling too.

562
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:37,228
What?

563
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:41,566
I'm sorry!

564
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:44,944
Sorry!

565
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:48,031
Did you do something?

566
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:52,619
I twisted his arm in my sleep.

567
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:55,246
God, I even drooled.

568
00:31:58,374 --> 00:32:01,294
-Is this the place?
-Yes. Let's go in.

569
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:09,010
I've never taught anyone how to fight.

570
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:11,346
Have you been in a real fight before?

571
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:12,430
Physically?

572
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:15,016
Arguments are not fights.
Have you ever beaten anyone up?

573
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,184
Of course not.

574
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:18,186
I wouldn't be an actor if I ever did that.

575
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,188
Oh, that makes sense.

576
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:24,359
But there's a difference
between movies and reality.

577
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:27,111
A good guy is always a good guy,
even when he fights.

578
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:28,821
He doesn't throw the first punch.

579
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:31,574
But to win a fight,
you have to be the more vicious one.

580
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:33,493
Elbow, fingernails.

581
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:36,412
Rocks. Use everything you can.

582
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:38,331
-You should swear more--
-Okay.

583
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:40,291
Stop chatting. Just show me.

584
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:53,763
Come on!

585
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:55,932
You have to be worked up to start a fight.

586
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:17,787
Are you getting pissed off?

587
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:33,803
She dodges me as if we rehearsed first.

588
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,889
A natural gift?
Or a result of painful training?

589
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:39,976
Either way, it's incredible.

590
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,021
Thumbs up.

591
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:53,197
Wait, time out!

592
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:55,533
Time out? Are you kidding me?

593
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:07,522
You are dead meat now.

594
00:35:07,605 --> 00:35:08,940
FINGERPRINT DOES NOT MATCH

595
00:35:11,526 --> 00:35:13,152
FINGERPRINT DOES NOT MATCH

596
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,492
Which finger is it?

597
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:26,624
Left little finger?

598
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:28,543
What a pervert!

599
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:33,840
"Princess"?

600
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:39,470
Thanks for the pocket money!

601
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:02,326
Are you okay?

602
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:06,372
What happened?

603
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:08,499
You got knocked out with one strike.

604
00:36:08,583 --> 00:36:09,417
What?

605
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,296
I was thinking about calling an ambulance,

606
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:15,381
and you woke up.

607
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:17,383
You didn't use a taser, did you?

608
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:19,343
Whoa, that's absurd!

609
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:23,890
Uncle.

610
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:26,976
It's her.

611
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:31,063
I knew it! I knew she was a minor.

612
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,442
Uncle, you're bleeding!

613
00:36:34,525 --> 00:36:36,777
Is that what she calls him
in front of others?

614
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,571
How did you get here?

615
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:42,575
You weren't answering her calls,
so she asked me where you were.

616
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:45,745
-That hurts!
-Is it that bad?

617
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:48,164
What are you doing anyway?

618
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:49,790
It's stunt training. I'm okay.

619
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:51,792
Let's take a break.

620
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:52,835
My niece is here.

621
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:57,256
Shouldn't you be at cram school?

622
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:00,927
Why is your bag so heavy?

623
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,303
Is she his niece?

624
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:03,638
Yes.

625
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:04,931
What kind?

626
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:07,850
Niece. Kang-ho's brother's daughter.

627
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:08,768
Huh?

628
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:12,521
Kang-ho is extremely fond of her.
He saved her number as "Princess."

629
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:15,107
Princess.

630
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:19,946
About Johnny's autograph,

631
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:22,490
they say it's different from the real one.

632
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:24,325
What do you mean?

633
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:28,246
I met with Johnny
and got it personally from him.

634
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:32,208
His manager must have signed
the one they think is real.

635
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:33,376
That's the fake one.

636
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:34,710
Oh, whatever.

637
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:36,295
They just don't believe me.

638
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:39,131
They don't even believe
that you're my uncle.

639
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:41,467
Why won't they believe you?

640
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:44,428
Because I acted like I have a mom.

641
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:47,223
I mean, I didn't act like I have one.

642
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:49,308
I just didn't tell them I don't have one.

643
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:51,519
Do they bully you because of that?

644
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:54,105
-They don't bully me.
-You said they don't believe you!

645
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:56,274
Treating you like a liar is bullying too.

646
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:58,234
They are not bad friends.

647
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:01,028
We've been friends
since elementary school,

648
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:03,281
so it must be shocking
to find out about it now.

649
00:38:03,864 --> 00:38:05,116
Why don't you get it?

650
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:06,033
God.

651
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:11,038
They don't believe that I'm your uncle?

652
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:14,875
Then how about I have a video call
with your friends?

653
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,961
-He's so handsome!
-I'm Nam Kang-ho, right?

654
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:18,254
I'm not anybody else.

655
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:19,964
Okay, girls.

656
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:21,507
I am Nam Kang-ho.

657
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,509
Ji-woo is my niece.

658
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:26,053
And I got the autographs
from Johnny himself.

659
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:28,097
To give them to you and Ji-woo.

660
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,265
Thank you so much!

661
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:32,268
-Ji-woo. Sorry!
-I'm sorry too!

662
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:34,520
Hey, Ji-woo. I believed you.

663
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:37,148
Should I treat your friends to a meal?

664
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:38,649
-Yes!
-Really?

665
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:40,651
-Me too!
-Me too!

666
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:45,364
Niece.

667
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:47,783
Kang-ho's brother's daughter.

668
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,160
-Here.
-Thank you.

669
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:51,912
This has never happened before.

670
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:54,665
I may have failed in beating up bad guys,

671
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,917
but I never beat up an innocent guy.

672
00:38:57,918 --> 00:39:01,047
Women are attracted to bad guys
not because they are bad.

673
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:03,799
Our hearts beat faster
for bad guys showing a good side

674
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:06,260
than for good guys
who are good all the time.

675
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:07,595
Okay!

676
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:08,763
Let's get real now.

677
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:11,140
We were just
feeling each other out before.

678
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:26,989
What is this?

679
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:28,991
"Catch me if you can"?

680
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:40,795
I'll catch you, then.

681
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:51,305
Come here!

682
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:01,148
Wait!

683
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:08,114
Time out!

684
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:09,782
I thought we had no time-outs!

685
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:36,100
Are you really doing your best?

686
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:38,519
Yeah! Please hit me.

687
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:41,439
Taking hits never felt so relieving.

688
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:43,691
So she was his niece. Jeez.

689
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,526
Let's call it a day.

690
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:46,944
No!

691
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,321
But why?

692
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:51,949
I'm not slacking off.

693
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:55,161
I got hit on purpose
to see how you beat people up.

694
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:56,996
Let's get into the details now.

695
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:58,914
I'll teach you some dirty tricks.

696
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:00,749
I'll give you a lift home.

697
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,838
Are you ignoring what I said?

698
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:11,552
Yeah.

699
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:13,471
Are you happy without me?

700
00:41:13,554 --> 00:41:15,473
I even remembered your birthday.

701
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:19,518
When you black out, forget
about this call and forget about that.

702
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:22,521
Forget? You're so mean and nasty!

703
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:24,190
Still, I did love you!

704
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:25,691
Happy birthday!

705
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:28,986
Is it your birthday?

706
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,865
-Yes.
-You mean today?

707
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:33,866
Yes.

708
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:37,661
Why didn't you say so?

709
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:39,747
I would've set another date.

710
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:42,917
We all work on our birthdays.
It's not a national holiday.

711
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:45,794
I got a proper birthday bash,
thanks to you.

712
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:48,797
You don't have to drive me.

713
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:50,549
-Goodbye.
-Do you have plans?

714
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:52,384
Right now?

715
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:54,303
I don't.

716
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:56,764
-Let's go eat somewhere.
-Together?

717
00:41:57,556 --> 00:41:58,474
Aren't you hungry?

718
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:00,267
I said let's eat!

719
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:05,856
What are birthdays to women?

720
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:08,275
It's an opportunity
to show off gifts, events,

721
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:10,945
the boyfriend who organizes
those gifts and events,

722
00:42:11,028 --> 00:42:11,946
and friends.

723
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:14,448
It's the day to show off
how happy they are.

724
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:29,880
But she doesn't mind where she goes
and is drinking her second bottle of soju.

725
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:31,882
She doesn't care about her birthday.

726
00:42:32,925 --> 00:42:33,926
An oddball.

727
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:40,558
Did you have soup this morning?
Don't you live with your parents?

728
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:42,810
Who was that friend? Your boyfriend?

729
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:44,144
Or don't you have one?

730
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:48,399
I'm asking because if you do,

731
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:50,651
I'd feel bad keeping you here.

732
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:54,363
I don't have one. If I did,
I wouldn't be doing this on my birthday.

733
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:58,075
I thought you were hungry.
Why aren't you eating?

734
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:04,873
You should eat too.
Drinking soju alone is bad for you.

735
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:08,460
I already stuffed myself
with all kinds of delicacies.

736
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:15,467
How long have you been a good fighter?

737
00:43:16,552 --> 00:43:17,720
Since I was young?

738
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:19,763
-Were you a bully?
-Bully?

739
00:43:21,515 --> 00:43:23,350
I used to beat them up.

740
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:24,935
If you were above bullies…

741
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:29,023
Were you a gangster?

742
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:31,984
I wanted to beat them up

743
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:33,360
by becoming a prosecutor.

744
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:35,779
But I failed the interview.

745
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:37,906
Are you a righteous person?

746
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:39,867
Not that.

747
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:41,410
I just wanted to be powerful.

748
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:43,996
Prosecutors have the most power
in this country.

749
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:46,457
Is that why you learned to fight?

750
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:48,542
I learned to defend myself at first.

751
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:49,793
Oh dear!

752
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:51,712
A crazy old man lived in my town.

753
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:54,715
-Are you back from school?
-Kids hated and avoided him.

754
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:57,009
But he still stalked and touched them.

755
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:59,470
I came home and told my parents,

756
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:01,722
and my dad told me
not to go down that alley.

757
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:05,768
That the world is full of men like that,
so I should be careful and avoid them.

758
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:10,022
I was young,
but I still felt something burning inside.

759
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:12,691
"I have to watch out and avoid them
because I'm a woman"?

760
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:14,026
"Because I'm weak"?

761
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:30,417
And about a year later,

762
00:44:31,293 --> 00:44:34,046
I trained myself hard
and went back to punish him.

763
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:34,963
Hey!

764
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,013
I'm sorry!

765
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:45,474
I just thought they were cute…

766
00:44:45,557 --> 00:44:47,601
But no one would believe

767
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:49,687
that such a healthy old man

768
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:53,190
got nearly beaten to death
by a 13-year-old girl.

769
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:57,945
And there were no cameras,
so it was a perfect crime.

770
00:44:59,154 --> 00:45:02,408
And also, when I punched the old man,

771
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:04,284
it felt really good!

772
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:08,956
To be honest,
fighting suits me better than the law.

773
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,960
If I had become a cop, I would've
gotten fired for beating up a suspect.

774
00:45:14,461 --> 00:45:16,004
She's definitely an oddball.

775
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,806
Sorry. I talked too much.
It's a boring story.

776
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:27,766
No, it was fun.

777
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,435
Do you have other stories?

778
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:31,228
Other stories?

779
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:32,688
When did you start liking me?

780
00:45:33,522 --> 00:45:35,691
-What?
-Why do you like me?

781
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:39,945
Oh, why wouldn't anyone like you?

782
00:45:40,529 --> 00:45:43,031
You're good-looking and sexy--

783
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:46,827
You're a great actor,

784
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:48,704
and you're a smart man from SNU!

785
00:45:48,787 --> 00:45:51,331
I'm not from SNU. I dropped out.

786
00:45:55,335 --> 00:45:57,171
I feel so bad. I can't stand it.

787
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,090
I beat you up too much on your birthday.

788
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:02,134
So!

789
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:04,344
A special gift!

790
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:14,229
You get a date with me!

791
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:19,443
What is he saying?

792
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:25,240
We can get some nice food
and go for a drive.

793
00:46:26,658 --> 00:46:29,244
Do you have anything else in mind?

794
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:30,913
Thanks for the offer,

795
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:33,957
but you don't have to do this.

796
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:36,794
-I'm okay!
-Don't say no. I'm okay too.

797
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:41,006
Oh my.

798
00:46:41,089 --> 00:46:43,842
Look at the time.

799
00:46:44,718 --> 00:46:48,305
The subway will be stuck in traffic.
I have work tomorrow, so…

800
00:46:51,558 --> 00:46:52,476
Thank you!

801
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:53,811
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

802
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,315
Is it sore where I hit you?

803
00:46:58,398 --> 00:46:59,733
No, I'm fine.

804
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:06,824
I don't do this often,
even at my fan meets.

805
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:10,077
Here.

806
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:33,308
Okay, thank you.

807
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:37,312
I feel all right.

808
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:44,069
Excuse me?

809
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:45,821
I'm very thankful, so--

810
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:48,448
I'm not panicking.

811
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:51,493
What is this?
