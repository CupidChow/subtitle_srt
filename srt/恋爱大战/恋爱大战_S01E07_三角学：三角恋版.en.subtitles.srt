1
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,523
LOVE TO HATE YOU

2
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:32,323
Is this enough,
or do you want to hug a little longer?

3
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:36,953
A little longer.

4
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:53,219
It's revenge.

5
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,138
He still hates me,

6
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:58,600
and he still likes me.

7
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,398
EPISODE 7
TRIGONOMETRY: THE LOVE TRIANGLE EDITION

8
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:12,405
I think this should be good enough.

9
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:20,163
Get some rest. I'll get going.

10
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:22,999
I'll give you a ride.

11
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:26,753
-To where?
-To your house.

12
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:28,671
All the way to Seoul?

13
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:31,883
I feel bad to have troubled you
on such short notice.

14
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:37,347
It's fine. You said you have a scene
to shoot tomorrow morning.

15
00:01:38,389 --> 00:01:39,599
You should go to bed.

16
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:48,900
I have to at least
walk my girlfriend to the car.

17
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:50,902
Why does he keep making my heart flutter?

18
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:04,165
Goodbye.

19
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,416
And have a good night.

20
00:02:06,334 --> 00:02:07,418
Okay.

21
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:19,556
-Take her home safely.
-Okay.

22
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,232
You must be exhausted. Get some sleep.

23
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:31,985
I'll wake you up when we arrive.

24
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:33,987
Okay, thank you.

25
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:54,632
Hey.

26
00:02:55,341 --> 00:02:56,426
You wanted to see me?

27
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:59,596
Wow, I didn't know
this would become such a fine scene.

28
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,973
What's the deal with your girlfriend?

29
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,893
Is she the punk
who helped with your training?

30
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:07,604
-Yes, that's her.
-Wow, awesome!

31
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:11,566
I noticed earlier that she could probably
do the fight scene in a single take.

32
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:14,152
Good, huh? She's a tough one.

33
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:20,742
Speaking of…

34
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:22,744
The director would like…

35
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:44,766
I was too arrogant.

36
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:46,559
I underestimated him.

37
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:50,021
He's the "God of Romance," after all.

38
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:56,236
But you won't get anything out of me

39
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,738
because I'm the bad guy here!

40
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:03,952
NAM KANG-HO

41
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,044
Hello?

42
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,129
Did I wake you?

43
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:16,214
No.

44
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:18,258
I was about to go to sleep.

45
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,555
Do you have something to say?

46
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,556
Oh.

47
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:30,061
The director wants to keep you on
as the stunt double.

48
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,522
That'd be fun. I'd love to!

49
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:39,320
If I have to change my schedule,
I'll talk to the firm,

50
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:40,905
but they'll probably say okay.

51
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:42,907
They treat me like a VIP, thanks to you.

52
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,784
-Thanks to me?
-Yeah.

53
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:46,035
I'm the VIP's girlfriend.

54
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,912
You can keep going if you'd like.

55
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:51,749
Ah, easy.

56
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:53,293
What was that?

57
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,628
Keep going as his girlfriend?

58
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,928
Well, give me a call later.

59
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:09,809
Damn it.

60
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:15,898
He's almost mine!

61
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,484
You poor thing!

62
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:41,799
An entertainment company
is not that wealthy.

63
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,843
It's all show and no go.

64
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:48,139
You should be looking
for husband material, you crazy bitch.

65
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:55,188
Why is he so handsome?

66
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:56,564
Oh my God!

67
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,025
Are you up?

68
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:01,110
Yeah, but why aren't you at work?

69
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,196
Did you have a sexy dream? It's Saturday.

70
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,781
-Oh…
-Come on. Let's eat.

71
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:14,916
Really? Not just a sample
but an actual published book?

72
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:18,628
The publisher was picking
4 out of 30 people,

73
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,338
and I was one of them!

74
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:22,757
Wow, that's amazing! Congratulations, Mom!

75
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,093
So I was thinking.

76
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:27,804
Is it okay to ask
your boyfriend for a favor?

77
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:28,721
Hello.

78
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:29,722
-Yes, hi!
-Hi.

79
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,933
Are you talking about a blurb?

80
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:34,143
No, that's a bit too…

81
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,479
Are you treating me like a stranger
now that you moved out?

82
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:39,232
You didn't even tell me
about dating Nam Kang-ho.

83
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:41,025
I found out about it on the news.

84
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,444
You went on public dates
but never introduced him to me.

85
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,822
When have I ever brought a boyfriend home?

86
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,865
Come on, Mom. Are you mad at me?

87
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:50,451
Please don't be mad!

88
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:52,537
I'll throw a cool party for your book.

89
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,497
My mom's amazing! Love you!

90
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:56,916
Yeah, sure.

91
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:59,252
I guess I love you too.

92
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,757
Hey, my mom's publishing a book.

93
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,176
She was chosen in her writing class.

94
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,470
Yeah? Wow.

95
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:16,018
-What?
-It's Do Won-jun, right?

96
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,230
I knew it.

97
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:22,108
A sucker for pretty faces is zoned out.
That means one thing.

98
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:25,194
The man you met
most recently was Do Won-jun.

99
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:28,781
He's super good-looking,
and he came to pick you up at the airport.

100
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,660
He's keeping tabs on you. You know that?
To keep you from saying anything.

101
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,665
Did I upset you?

102
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:40,501
You can charm a guy like Nam Kang-ho,
but what about me?

103
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:45,131
Yeah, I know.
You and I are in a different league.

104
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:46,716
Hey!

105
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:50,303
You break the hearts of guys you meet,
and I get my heart broken every time.

106
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:52,847
Obviously, I am the problem.

107
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:57,143
That's because I'm mean,
and you're too nice.

108
00:07:57,768 --> 00:08:00,771
You don't spend a dime on yourself
but spend it all on guys.

109
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,191
That just makes me sad.

110
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,985
I'm sorry that I upset you.

111
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:09,530
But I'm really not sure about Do Won-jun.

112
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:14,494
At least his intentions aren't pure.
Look how he got me into a dating contract.

113
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:16,370
You said you're not sure about him.

114
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:19,165
It doesn't hurt to be suspicious
of men you don't know.

115
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:21,709
Sure, you're probably right.
Why would I be right?

116
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:24,921
Hey!

117
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:27,089
Yes, Mr. Ko.

118
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,842
This is Yeo Mi-ran.
I have something to discuss with--

119
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,677
I also have something to discuss.

120
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:34,972
The penalty is three times the amount.

121
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:37,225
Damage to the brand image
caused by Choi Soo-jin.

122
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:38,434
Drop in sales.

123
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,853
And the cost to reshoot the ads
comes out to…

124
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:43,731
three billion won.

125
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:49,529
We can't do anything about the penalty,
but we have to dispute the rest.

126
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,990
I wish I could go with you,

127
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:56,285
but I have some bad blood
with one of their executives.

128
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:00,456
How much lower is a good defense?

129
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,626
Bring it down as much as you can.
As much as you can, okay?

130
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:05,044
Let's see what you can do.

131
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:09,757
Good work.

132
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,758
Good work today.

133
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:13,010
-Good job today.
-Thank you, you too.

134
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,222
Kang-ho.

135
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:19,725
Do you know what's wrong with Ms. Oh?

136
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:20,810
What do you mean?

137
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:24,564
Well, she's crying over there,
and her stylist doesn't know why either.

138
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:30,570
I'll go take a look.

139
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,033
Ms. Oh.

140
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:39,745
Oh, Kang-ho.

141
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:44,667
Is something wrong?

142
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:48,087
-No.
-Then why are you crying?

143
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:49,797
Can I be frank with you?

144
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:54,218
What is it?

145
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:55,386
Yesterday…

146
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,097
I saw you.

147
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:00,099
You and her.

148
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,351
I could tell it was genuine.

149
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:03,894
How does it feel?

150
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:05,813
Do you feel better?

151
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,399
This is what your revenge looks like.

152
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:13,321
-Se-na.
-Yeah.

153
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:20,786
Let's act like professionals, okay?
Like professionals.

154
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:26,042
Your stylist is waiting. Hurry up and go.

155
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:34,050
Is he really with that woman?

156
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,594
No way.

157
00:10:37,178 --> 00:10:38,596
What the hell? Damn it!

158
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:42,475
-Why haven't you picked up your phone?
-Sorry. I've been busy these days.

159
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:44,894
Busy doing what? Meeting your girlfriend?

160
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,313
No, I just got back home
from the movie set.

161
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:49,357
-I'm with my friends right now.
-What?

162
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,608
-Friends?
-Buy us dinner.

163
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:53,110
Right. I should take you all out to eat.

164
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:55,946
-We're hungry!
-I haven't eaten since you promised us.

165
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:56,947
We're starving!

166
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:58,949
-Take us out to eat now.
-Right now?

167
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,242
-Shooting pose!
-Shoot?

168
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,619
One, two, three.

169
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:05,081
It came out so well.

170
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,707
-Awesome.
-You're so cool.

171
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,167
You're crazy good-looking.

172
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:10,169
You look so young.

173
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:11,921
You look like her brother.

174
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,339
Okay, eat up.

175
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:18,177
I'll take you girls out to eat again,
so be good friends to Ji-woo, okay?

176
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,804
-Definitely not her brother.
-No.

177
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,722
Uncle. He's an uncle.

178
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,768
Your girlfriend
is that lady from before, right?

179
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:26,686
Huh?

180
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,438
Oh, yeah. How did you know?

181
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:32,608
I could tell by her clothes.
Was that the day the picture was taken?

182
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,735
-The picture?
-We all saw it too.

183
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:37,530
Oh.

184
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:38,906
Thank you for the food!

185
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:40,199
Study hard--

186
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:43,035
-See you all later.
-Okay, goodbye!

187
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:44,036
Yeah, okay.

188
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,997
-Bye.
-Yeah. Okay, bye.

189
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,375
Yeah, take care. Go on!

190
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:56,173
How far are we going?

191
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,150
I got the hang of this!

192
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:15,651
You're good, Soo-jin!

193
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:17,361
Wait for me!

194
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:32,168
-I got him.
-Why is it so hard to beat?

195
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,088
Come out. Cover me!

196
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,423
A zombie!

197
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:40,301
Die!

198
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:42,178
-Soo-jin!
-Die!

199
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:47,558
They're dead!

200
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,189
Wow, we barely made it.

201
00:12:54,648 --> 00:12:56,400
You're so "you," even in a game.

202
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:57,902
Wow, seriously!

203
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:00,029
You were awesome. That was so good!

204
00:13:02,364 --> 00:13:05,993
I charged only half of the usual amount
to help out a new company,

205
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:09,079
and they ask for three billion?
And what, their sales dropped?

206
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:11,916
That's a stinking lie.
Those dirty bastards!

207
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:16,045
Are you still mad?
Do you want to go for another round?

208
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:17,004
Kill more zombies?

209
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,466
You're not busy?
Don't you have work to do?

210
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,134
I have a lot of work to do.

211
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:25,596
But I'm here watching you
in case you get into more trouble.

212
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,890
Just say you like hanging out with me.

213
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:29,850
Because I like hanging out with you.

214
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,894
I like hanging out with you too.

215
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:34,480
Okay, then. Let's keep playing.

216
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:37,483
As for the work, Ms. Yeo Mi-ran said

217
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:39,819
she'd take care of it,
so we don't have to worry.

218
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:43,113
You called her "unsettling" before.
Why the sudden change?

219
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,907
Well, Kang-ho likes her.

220
00:13:45,658 --> 00:13:48,410
At first, I thought
she was just here to pester Kang-ho.

221
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,664
Then I guess Do Won-jun must feel
a bit lonely now.

222
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,833
Your bestie has a girlfriend now.

223
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:55,960
Maybe?

224
00:13:56,544 --> 00:14:00,214
Why don't you go out with someone?
Is there really no one you like?

225
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,260
Well, the thing is,

226
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:08,472
I was like, "I'll meet an amazing woman
if I become successful."

227
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:10,099
Then it started to feel like

228
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:13,269
I could meet an even better woman
if I become more successful.

229
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:19,692
I'll say no to any girl you go out with,
no matter how amazing she is.

230
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:20,818
Why?

231
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:23,946
I'd be jealous of the woman
who gets to have you all to herself.

232
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:26,448
Jeez!

233
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:29,702
So that's why you're always
getting into trouble.

234
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,454
To keep me all to yourself
by making me worry about you.

235
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,791
Oh! Now that's an idea.

236
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,960
I could just keep causing trouble!

237
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,962
Then your contract will be terminated.

238
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:41,130
God, so silly.

239
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:44,049
I'll stay out of trouble, so go and date.

240
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,093
Once my divorce is finalized,

241
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:49,346
I'm going to find a really nice guy.
Someone better than you.

242
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:52,850
You want to meet a guy again
after having been burned by one?

243
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:55,311
Love isn't bad.
It's the people that are bad.

244
00:14:57,021 --> 00:15:01,191
When in love, we are in our purest state.

245
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,988
Don't waste your life.
Find someone to love.

246
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,705
Please take this down nice and clean.

247
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,125
And the one over there too.

248
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:24,048
Her divorce had a negative impact on us,

249
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,841
but we were willing to overlook that.

250
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:29,511
But to go to a detention center
after an intentional car accident?

251
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:30,930
That leaves us no choice.

252
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,264
We recognize that too,

253
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:35,267
but we want transparency
regarding compensation for damages.

254
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:38,479
So show us your operating margin
and sales for the past five years.

255
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:41,523
Well, I don't know about that.

256
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:45,194
I mean, do we really have to disclose
our operating profit margin?

257
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:48,739
If we take this to court,
you'll have to submit it anyway.

258
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:51,033
Even if your sales have dropped,

259
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,701
the prejudication states,

260
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:56,747
"Despite a decrease in sales according
to tax invoices, financial statements,

261
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,749
and account books for the past five years,

262
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:00,751
the recent domestic economic trends show

263
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:05,839
there is no proof that the said celebrity
has caused the decrease in sales."

264
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:08,592
"The said celebrity's contribution
to the decrease in sales

265
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:12,012
has not been proven
by the plaintiff's objective evidence."

266
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:18,602
As you know, the court is very passive
when dealing with these kinds of cases,

267
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:22,231
so it's likely that we'll end up wasting
each other's energy and money.

268
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,609
And even if you do get a partial win,

269
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:28,654
which celebrity would want to work
for your company?

270
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:29,780
They'll be scared.

271
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:33,534
My precious baby is here!

272
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,081
Oh my Lord!

273
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,541
Gil-mu!

274
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:44,670
She's not your precious baby
but Nam Kang-ho's precious girlfriend!

275
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:46,630
That's right. My bad!

276
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,716
-That was unnecessary.
-It's fine!

277
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:51,844
This is why I don't hire
female lawyers, you know.

278
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:55,055
-Boss, you're so ancient!
-Ancient!

279
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,598
And we're modern!

280
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:57,516
Oh, whatever!

281
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,436
But seriously,
how can I not be excited right now?

282
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:03,772
She shaved off two out of three billion!

283
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:08,485
You usually go through many tugs-of-war
to shave off even half of the amount.

284
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:11,572
But wow, she throws the opponent
with just one swing?

285
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,407
With just one swing!

286
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:17,828
I thought you were just a pretty face,
but your work is even more beautiful!

287
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:19,204
Yeah!

288
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:22,708
Now, with this kind of outcome,
Ms. Choi will give us a little extra, eh?

289
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,168
Definitely more than 20%!

290
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:26,754
She's not stingy
when it comes to contingency fees.

291
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:28,922
So, maybe 30%?

292
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:30,799
That's right!

293
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:33,802
At least 600 million won, right? Yeah!

294
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,262
Oh, so now,

295
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:38,265
how much bonus would you like,
Attorney Yeo?

296
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:41,226
-Bonus?
-Tell us. Don't be shy.

297
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:45,314
If you could allow it,

298
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:48,525
I'd like to ask for a lot more flexibility
in my work schedule.

299
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:49,610
Work schedule?

300
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:50,944
Yes.

301
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:54,907
I was a stunt double for Oh Se-na
in a scene from Nam Kang-ho's movie,

302
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,284
and they want me to continue.

303
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:58,368
Oh Se-na?

304
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:01,288
You're doing that on top of being
Nam's sparring partner?

305
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:03,749
It just kind of happened that way.

306
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:08,170
If it's Oh Se-na,
you don't even need to ask!

307
00:18:08,253 --> 00:18:12,091
Oh, and if you could go there
as a representative of our firm

308
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,885
and get her to be our VIP client,
we would appreciate it.

309
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:16,220
We'd appreciate it!

310
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:20,265
If Oh messes up her stellar reputation,
that will be the jackpot!

311
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,184
That's right!

312
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:25,437
We really hired ourselves an ace
with great connections!

313
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,356
An ace! A sweetheart!

314
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:28,607
Oh yes!

315
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:30,859
A sweetheart! A lucky charm!

316
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:34,279
Our job feeds off
the misfortunes of others.

317
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:43,997
That's it!

318
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:46,667
I can break this spell
with another pretty face.

319
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:50,587
He may be good-looking,
but he's no match for Nam Kang-ho!

320
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,677
Oh, you're home!

321
00:18:58,637 --> 00:18:59,721
Are you still mad?

322
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,807
Hey, I'm not mad.

323
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:03,934
But you know,

324
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:07,479
aren't you going to introduce me
to Nam Kang-ho?

325
00:19:07,563 --> 00:19:10,274
-Huh?
-I mean, I'm your best friend.

326
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:15,154
If someone asks me if I've met him,
it'd be weird to say that I haven't.

327
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:19,741
Well, that's true,

328
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:22,369
but he's busy filming a movie now.

329
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:25,455
Can I tag along
when you go in to be the stunt double?

330
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:28,709
When will I ever have an opportunity
to see something like that?

331
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,796
It's okay if you don't want to.

332
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:34,882
Hey, that's not it!

333
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,967
Of course I'll ask!

334
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:37,885
Hello!

335
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,890
Yes, it's cool.

336
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:48,103
I was worried about you waiting alone
and getting bored.

337
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,105
It's good if she comes with you.

338
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:54,193
Maybe I should buy drinks for everyone?

339
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,862
I feel bad going empty-handed.

340
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:01,408
You're not my manager. Don't wander around
because everyone's busy working.

341
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:04,453
So bossy for someone
who's only done one stunt.

342
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,487
Now that's an untrained fighter!

343
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,656
A dirty street fight
of a self-taught thug!

344
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,157
That's what I'm talking about!

345
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:45,786
Are you all right?

346
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:48,372
Honey.

347
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,876
That was amazing!

348
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,796
Yeah. Excellent work!

349
00:20:57,714 --> 00:20:59,341
It's so cool being on set!

350
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:05,222
There he is.

351
00:21:08,016 --> 00:21:10,936
Wow. That's what he looks like
even when he's on a break?

352
00:21:11,436 --> 00:21:15,107
I know.
Why does he look like that all the time?

353
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:17,317
Wait.

354
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:18,860
-What's he doing here?
-Hey.

355
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:20,570
Is everything good?

356
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:24,449
Yeah. At least you should stay
out of trouble, please. Jeez.

357
00:21:25,325 --> 00:21:26,410
Oh. Huh?

358
00:21:28,036 --> 00:21:30,038
-Hey, isn't that Na-eun?
-Yeah.

359
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,623
I told Mi-ran to bring her.

360
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,875
She'd be bored with all the downtime.

361
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:38,672
-How have you been?
-Oh, hello.

362
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:42,050
Wow, you even fill in
as a stunt double in his film.

363
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:45,220
Kang-ho met such an amazing girlfriend.

364
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,639
Oh, not at all!

365
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,684
Have you been well too, Na-eun?

366
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:52,519
Yes.

367
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:54,771
Hello. It's nice to meet you.

368
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:58,150
It's nice to meet you too.
Thank you for inviting me.

369
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:00,360
Actually, I was going to give you a call.

370
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:01,445
And why?

371
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:04,156
We should grab a bite, you know.

372
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,742
We didn't get a chance to eat last time.

373
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:09,202
It's okay.

374
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:11,997
My lips are sealed,
so you don't have to worry about me.

375
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,752
You're being too obvious.

376
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,920
-Enjoy!
-Thank you!

377
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:21,673
It looks delicious.

378
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,342
-Thank you.
-Oh, it looks good.

379
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:25,552
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

380
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:26,595
Wow, our turn!

381
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,222
Here, have some bread too.

382
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:30,223
Thanks.

383
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:33,560
But why is Nam Kang-ho's girlfriend
standing in for Oh Se-na?

384
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:35,312
You know that's all just nepotism.

385
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:37,689
Honestly, you don't need
a stunt double for this.

386
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:40,233
I bet they pulled strings
so they could be together.

387
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:42,652
I heard she was a lawyer.
Doesn't she work?

388
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:45,572
Never mind the girlfriend.
What's wrong with Nam Kang-ho?

389
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:47,157
That's so unprofessional.

390
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:49,910
You want me to cover
the running scene as well?

391
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:53,246
Yes. Ms. Oh runs in a funny way.

392
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:55,248
Kind of like this?

393
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:09,429
Come on. No way!

394
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:10,514
I'm serious.

395
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:13,183
I'll go over the details later,
so stand by.

396
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:14,393
-Okay.
-All right.

397
00:23:16,395 --> 00:23:17,562
How have you been?

398
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:20,440
And you are…

399
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:23,944
Oh, the fan club president?

400
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:25,112
Yes.

401
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:26,696
Can we talk?

402
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:32,077
Do you know that all the people
working here don't like you?

403
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,079
-Really?
-Yes.

404
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:36,581
They diss you for following
your lover around at work.

405
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,089
I'm not following him around.

406
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:47,759
The director asked me
to be Ms. Oh Se-na's stunt double.

407
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:50,429
And who here considers you
a stunt performer?

408
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:52,264
They all see you as Kang-ho's lover.

409
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:55,183
Even if you really came here
for that reason,

410
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,936
the truth doesn't matter in this business.

411
00:23:58,019 --> 00:23:59,688
It's all about how it looks to others.

412
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:04,359
You must know about the top actors
whose bad marriages ruined their careers

413
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:07,279
because they married unlikable women.

414
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:09,990
Are you saying that I'm unlikable?

415
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:13,410
I'm telling you to be careful
not to become unlikable.

416
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:14,661
For Kang-ho's sake.

417
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:16,955
You love him, don't you?

418
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:21,543
Well, you may not like hearing this
because I'm overstepping--

419
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:23,628
Actually, I'm not overstepping anything.

420
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,255
The reason I can tell you that

421
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:30,343
is because he could break up with you,
but we will always be with him.

422
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,053
Forever.

423
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:37,809
I think his makeup looks
a bit darker today.

424
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:39,269
Oh, I'll try to fix it.

425
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:41,354
"All show and no go."

426
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:45,734
If he admitted it himself,
it means he really isn't all that.

427
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,736
You have a lot of action scenes, so…

428
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:50,322
Damn it, he's not all that,

429
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,241
but he's just so good-looking!

430
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,619
Do I take this off when I'm done?

431
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:03,168
Why is he headed this way?

432
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:05,504
What do I do?

433
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:08,256
Don't come to me. I said don't!

434
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:12,469
You thought it'd be fun,
but it's really boring, isn't it?

435
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:14,554
No, I'm having fun.

436
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:16,598
It's almost dinnertime.

437
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:20,435
The crew will eat from the food truck.
Shall we go out and eat something good?

438
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,856
Like I said,
you don't have to worry about me, okay?

439
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,650
How can I not worry about you?

440
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:29,736
The best friend of Kang-ho's girlfriend
is dear to Kang-ho as well,

441
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:31,112
so I must take good care of you.

442
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:36,117
I'll give you options
that Koreans love the most.

443
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:40,455
Korean, Chinese, Japanese, and Western.
Which would you like?

444
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:45,168
Well, anything that's less
than 10,000 won per person.

445
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:46,169
What?

446
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:48,964
I'd feel uncomfortable
with anything more expensive.

447
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:52,884
Hello.

448
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:00,058
Have you eaten yet?

449
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:06,439
And who here considers you
a stunt performer?

450
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:08,483
They all see you as Kang-ho's lover.

451
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:17,534
I feel a sense of duty
to change their minds.

452
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:22,205
Not for Nam Kang-ho's image
but for the honor of women.

453
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:31,798
-Hey, stop right there!
-Get her!

454
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:53,528
Oh, I'm sorry!

455
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,488
I was supposed to get caught, right?

456
00:26:55,572 --> 00:26:59,075
You're running too fast.
You shouldn't get further away from them.

457
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:01,411
Hey! Why are you guys running so slow?

458
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:04,247
-Do you guys need to pee?
-Sorry, sir.

459
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:07,292
Don't just pretend to catch her.
Catch her for real!

460
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:09,044
-Yes, sir.
-Another thing.

461
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:12,589
You're running like a professional.
Se-na is not an athlete, you know.

462
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:14,674
Okay, I'm sorry.

463
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:16,343
-Get it right!
-Yes, sir!

464
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:17,844
Let's go one more time!

465
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:19,179
Yeah, let's go again!

466
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:20,680
Okay, we're going again.

467
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:24,976
Oh no, I'm in close quarters
with him again!

468
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:26,645
This is killing me!

469
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:32,942
Here. Have some of this.

470
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:35,654
Seriously?

471
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:38,782
Even his hands are good-looking!

472
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:39,699
Here, this too.

473
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:41,242
I'll eat it myself.

474
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:42,202
No!

475
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:45,080
Only one of us needs
to get our hands dirty.

476
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:45,997
Please eat.

477
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:55,048
Oh, do you not like shrimp?

478
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:59,135
Is this less than 10,000 won per person?

479
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:00,136
Oh…

480
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:03,348
I told them we're shooting a film nearby,

481
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:06,851
and they gave us a discount
so we could become regulars.

482
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:08,603
Liar.

483
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:10,605
This one is a liar.

484
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:15,026
At least his intentions aren't pure.
Look how he got me into a dating contract.

485
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:18,697
If I can't stop myself
from falling for this guy,

486
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:22,033
then I just need to stop him
from falling for me.

487
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:28,456
Oh, you must not like the food here.

488
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:33,920
Be honest with me. How much is this meal?

489
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:39,884
I made myself clear that I wanted a meal
that was less than 10,000 won.

490
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:42,971
I guess you think of others' opinions
as a joke.

491
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:44,806
No.

492
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:48,435
I mean,
this is my first time treating you.

493
00:28:48,518 --> 00:28:50,103
And 10,000 won is a bit too…

494
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:51,479
Oh!

495
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,232
So a 10,000-won meal is a joke to you.

496
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:58,194
A meal for regular people ranges
between 7,000 to 8,000 won.

497
00:28:58,278 --> 00:28:59,988
Do you think 10,000 won is cheap?

498
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,575
And do you think I'm stupid?

499
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:05,493
This looks like it's over 30,000 won.

500
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:08,246
You said you're not
as wealthy as you look.

501
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:09,914
That you are strapped for cash.

502
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:11,958
Oh!

503
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:14,794
Is it okay to use the company's money
and not your money?

504
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:17,589
Keep that up,
and your company will go broke too.

505
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:20,216
What have I just done?

506
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,719
He hasn't done anything to me!

507
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:26,806
Oh, are you referring to
what I said before about my business?

508
00:29:27,348 --> 00:29:28,349
Is that it?

509
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:32,103
So, were you worried about me?

510
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:37,108
I find that so cute!

511
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:39,569
Wow, you are so sweet.

512
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:42,739
I'm not that sweet.

513
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:45,074
I don't worry about just anyone, okay?

514
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:02,967
Why are you laughing?

515
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:05,261
Apparently, I'm not "just anyone."

516
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:06,721
I guess that's a good thing.

517
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:11,100
Seriously? Did I just confess my feelings?

518
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:13,311
Come on, you should eat.

519
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:15,313
I'm not struggling that badly.

520
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:24,239
Hey, stop!

521
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:25,990
You bastard!

522
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:28,993
Come back here!

523
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:35,917
That was good.
We'll prepare the next scene!

524
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,962
I thought you'd feel nervous
if I were watching, so I didn't.

525
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:40,964
Did something happen?

526
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:43,800
I made some mistakes,
but it's not a problem.

527
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:44,926
Do you want me to come?

528
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:46,094
No!

529
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:47,846
Just concentrate on your scenes.

530
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,681
-Okay, I will.
-Bye.

531
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:52,851
Hello.

532
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:56,396
Oh, hello!

533
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:58,815
I didn't properly introduce myself.

534
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:00,567
You're Kang-ho's girlfriend, right?

535
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:02,861
Oh, yes.

536
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:05,154
I was shocked because you were so good.

537
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:07,699
I didn't do all that much!

538
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:09,617
What shocked me more

539
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:13,204
was that you're Kang-ho's girlfriend.

540
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:14,372
Oh.

541
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:16,374
Well, yes.

542
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:29,345
He's really wonderful, isn't he?

543
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:30,263
Huh?

544
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,557
Oh. Yes.

545
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,267
You don't have to worry about me.

546
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:38,104
He's really good
at keeping things professional.

547
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:41,774
So you can trust him.

548
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:47,155
He didn't tell you about me?

549
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:48,948
About what?

550
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:54,954
That we used to date…

551
00:31:57,498 --> 00:31:59,667
Oh no. He didn't tell you?

552
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:03,254
It's not like him
to hide things like that.

553
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:08,593
Oh, what have I done?

554
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:13,181
I shouldn't have told you
if he didn't tell you about it.

555
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:16,434
The thing is…

556
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:20,730
we were each other's first love.

557
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,775
It was a very long time ago.

558
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:25,276
Oh Se-na.

559
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,320
"Every Man's First Love."

560
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:30,031
She is Nam Kang-ho's first love?

561
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:31,491
That's right.

562
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:35,078
"Every Man's First Love"
is your boyfriend's first love.

563
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:38,247
Oh, I see.

564
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:40,166
I didn't know.

565
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:41,125
I'm sorry.

566
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:43,461
It's okay. Why should you be sorry?

567
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:44,712
Oh no.

568
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:47,590
I think he wanted to keep it a secret.

569
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:51,302
He can't find out that I told you.

570
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:53,471
I won't say anything. Don't worry.

571
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:56,265
I messed up again.

572
00:32:57,642 --> 00:33:00,895
I did a lot of bad things to him.

573
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:08,486
I have a lot to be sorry about.

574
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:10,279
To Kang-ho.

575
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:17,620
She likes him.

576
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,915
She still likes Nam Kang-ho.

577
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:22,500
I'm not okay.

578
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:25,378
All right, we're rolling!

579
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:33,052
-Grab it, dude.
-Hyeok-su, ready?

580
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:35,013
-Yes, I'm ready.
-Okay.

581
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:37,432
-Wire team, are you ready?
-We're ready!

582
00:33:37,515 --> 00:33:39,183
All right, we're rolling!

583
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:46,816
You're taking a moment to breathe.

584
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:50,319
Now you're slowly climbing up.

585
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:55,658
Yes, you're doing good.

586
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:01,914
Okay, Hyeok-su.

587
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:05,001
You're getting angrier.

588
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:11,174
You're climbing faster.

589
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:14,302
You're getting filled with rage!

590
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:17,722
You're climbing faster and climbing up!

591
00:34:18,306 --> 00:34:20,016
More! Just a bit more!

592
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:46,751
Hey, what's going on?

593
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:48,294
Ms. Yeo!

594
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,930
-Ms. Yeo, are you okay?
-Hurry!

595
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:00,306
Could you move over?

596
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:02,225
What happened?

597
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:04,268
Ow, that hurts a little.

598
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:05,520
-Blood!
-There's blood!

599
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:07,188
-Call 911!
-Ambulance!

600
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:08,606
-Hurry!
-Ambulance!

601
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:10,983
Darn it. Get on my back!

602
00:35:18,199 --> 00:35:19,700
How did this happen?

603
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:23,871
He should have looked back and stopped,

604
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,082
but he pulled along
with the guys in the front.

605
00:35:30,795 --> 00:35:33,965
If she hadn't gone to grab him,
they would all have fallen down.

606
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:44,350
Oh shit!

607
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:47,645
And if they had let go,
you'd have fallen straight down too.

608
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:51,440
Wow, how did she think
about running over to help?

609
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:54,193
I mean, she could have died.

610
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:57,155
Is she that foolish of a woman?

611
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:59,448
I bet her shoulder was hurt badly.

612
00:36:03,828 --> 00:36:05,580
This will sting.

613
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,132
Wow, you are very tough.

614
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:24,223
Are you okay?

615
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:25,183
Huh?

616
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:28,936
Of course I'm okay!

617
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,063
Why are you here? What about the shoot?

618
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:33,566
Who cares about that? You almost died!

619
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:37,361
-It would take more than that to kill me.
-Actually, no.

620
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:40,198
You really could have died.
Don't ever do that again.

621
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:42,909
Someone was about to die.
How could I just stand and watch?

622
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:45,661
See? Look at her.
She knew it was dangerous.

623
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:47,413
That's it.

624
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:49,415
My girlfriend is a very stubborn person.

625
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:51,417
I think you should find someone else.

626
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:53,961
Wait, can a lead actor
just fire someone like this?

627
00:36:54,045 --> 00:36:55,296
Isn't this abuse of power?

628
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:57,798
You wouldn't be here if it weren't for me!

629
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,258
But you did call me here!

630
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:02,470
Why are you trying to turn me
into a coward now? Am I right?

631
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:05,640
I won't bail because of a little injury.
I'm staying on!

632
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:08,851
-A little? How many stitches did you get?
-Not that many!

633
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:10,519
How many stitches?

634
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:12,355
She got 14 stitches.

635
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:14,232
Fourteen?

636
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:15,650
Oh no!

637
00:37:17,151 --> 00:37:18,110
Where are they?

638
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:20,947
He said they were coming back to the set.

639
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:21,864
What?

640
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:25,368
Okay. I'll be there as soon as I can.

641
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:29,747
I knew something like this would happen.
How could I not worry?

642
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:31,540
I'm sorry.

643
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:35,795
She got hurt while working this gig
to help Kang-ho.

644
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:38,547
I apologize on his behalf.

645
00:37:43,135 --> 00:37:45,054
Mi-ran! Are you okay?

646
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:46,472
What happened?

647
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:47,556
Are you all right?

648
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:49,809
Yeah, I'm fine. Don't overreact.

649
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:52,395
You can't ride in a car like this.
Sleep here tonight.

650
00:37:52,979 --> 00:37:54,689
Yes, I think that would be best.

651
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:57,400
You'll have to keep your back away
from the seat.

652
00:37:57,483 --> 00:37:58,776
Man, that won't do.

653
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:00,444
Then I'll just lie on my stomach.

654
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:02,613
-What?
-Let's go. You drive.

655
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:04,198
-Okay.
-Oh, wait.

656
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,158
That's not a good idea.

657
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:09,161
You drank earlier, Na-eun.
Your face is red.

658
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:11,330
Oh, that's right. I drank some beer.

659
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:12,915
Oh, well done.

660
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:14,792
Won-jun can take Na-eun home.

661
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:16,377
Let's go. Don't just stand there!

662
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:19,839
Oh, but I wonder if there's a spare room.

663
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:20,881
I'm sorry.

664
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:27,430
How could there not be a single room left?

665
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:29,598
You didn't have a hand in this, did you?

666
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:35,855
Are you saying that I bribed the hotel
just so we could sleep together?

667
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:38,024
Why not just say I planned the accident?

668
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:40,526
That I made you get hurt
so you couldn't go home.

669
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:46,574
Are you okay?

670
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:48,075
Yes, I'm fine.

671
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:49,618
She's not okay.

672
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:52,830
She's in no condition to ride in a car,

673
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:55,249
so she'll sleep in my room tonight.

674
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,379
You didn't have to tell her
it was your room.

675
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:04,633
That's a pretty bad injury. I'm so sorry.

676
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:06,552
It's just a few stitches.

677
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:08,471
Fourteen stitches are just a few?

678
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:13,017
This woman…

679
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:16,103
she's for real.

680
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:19,315
She really does love Nam Kang-ho.

681
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:24,445
Well, get some rest.

682
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:35,039
Why am I letting myself play this game?

683
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,292
Nam Kang-ho means nothing to me.

684
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:39,794
Ms. Oh.

685
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:45,049
Could I…

686
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:49,303
perhaps sleep in your room tonight?

687
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:52,890
-There's no spare room left.
-What are you talking about?

688
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:55,601
What would people say

689
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:58,020
about you bringing your girlfriend
in as a stunt double

690
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:00,106
and also having her sleep in your room?

691
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:03,401
Well, I'm okay with it.

692
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:05,861
You can use
my makeup remover and lotion too.

693
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:06,987
Okay.

694
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:08,280
Honey.

695
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:12,243
Huh?

696
00:40:16,288 --> 00:40:17,540
It's because I'm worried.

697
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:21,460
Sleep in my room.

698
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:26,924
Sleep in my room.
