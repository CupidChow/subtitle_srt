1
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:23,523
LOVE TO HATE YOU

2
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:30,697
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,454
Please forgive me.

4
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:43,626
So?

5
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,046
Pardon?

6
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:50,258
If you say sorry and I forgive you,
is that it?

7
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,138
-What about the director and the staff?
-Oh!

8
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:56,931
I'll apologize to them, of course.

9
00:00:57,932 --> 00:00:58,808
How?

10
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:05,148
You better apologize

11
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:08,026
to every single one of them
like you just did to me.

12
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:09,277
What?

13
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:16,493
Do as I say, or I'll end you.

14
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,579
EPISODE 2
BAD BOY

15
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:20,872
Did you see his face?

16
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,458
"Do as I say, or I'll kill you both."

17
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:25,043
-That's what it said.
-Yeah!

18
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:27,045
Now you know what I mean, don't you?

19
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:28,463
It was even worse that day.

20
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:31,049
What kind of "God of Romance"
bullies actresses like this?

21
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:33,551
-He's pissing me off!
-That's what I'm saying!

22
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:35,553
"Do as you like."

23
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,430
That's what I did.

24
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:39,808
You did the right thing.

25
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,228
With the mess she caused,
she deserves this much.

26
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:46,606
-How did you do it?
-It was nothing.

27
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:47,941
I just contacted Gilmu.

28
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:49,192
They must have threatened

29
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,152
that production would file
a claim for damages.

30
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:52,570
I knew it.

31
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:55,990
God, you're so…

32
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:57,826
Why? What's wrong?

33
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:02,247
I'm so damn embarrassed
in front of the Gilmu guys!

34
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,582
You always pick fights with women!

35
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:08,586
"The nicest celebrity, Nam Kang-ho,
is nasty and petty in real life."

36
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,921
That's what they'll think.

37
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:12,799
Gilmu's lawyers haven't even met you yet.

38
00:02:12,882 --> 00:02:15,260
I bet they gossip about you
any way they like.

39
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:17,470
Who knows if they'll keep
attorney-client privilege?

40
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:22,058
How about I visit and buy lunch?

41
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:23,935
What?

42
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:29,816
Gilmu Law Corporation.

43
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:33,278
Let me explain what this place is like.

44
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:34,195
She's coming out!

45
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:35,989
She's here!

46
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:37,490
Yoo-yeon!

47
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:42,287
GILMU'S ATTORNEY

48
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:44,122
Did you know about the plagiarism?

49
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:46,082
How do you feel right now?

50
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:50,962
This is unfair.

51
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:55,300
Our producer started working
on the song six years ago,

52
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:58,428
and we've been listening to it since then.

53
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,930
They mainly defend celebrities
in the entertainment field…

54
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,098
GILMU'S MANAGING PARTNER

55
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,350
…and their philosophy is clear.

56
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,103
"Kill two birds with one stone."

57
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,940
To party with celebrities
and make money too.

58
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,451
They either have no sense of shame

59
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,286
or just endure it.

60
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:30,793
Hello.

61
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,212
I'm here for the interview.

62
00:03:32,295 --> 00:03:34,339
The interview room is this way.

63
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:36,591
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

64
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:42,805
The biggest problem is
that they exclusively hire men.

65
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:47,227
Female lawyers are not hired here.

66
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,479
-Why is a woman here?
-They won't hire her.

67
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:56,277
-Ms. Yeo Mi-ran?
-Yes!

68
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:00,615
Yeah, I know.
I was called here as a formality.

69
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,992
But I showed up anyway

70
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,994
because I'm that desperate.

71
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:08,748
I'm in a spot
where I'm hoping against hope.

72
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:33,273
Why are they all men? I see only one girl.

73
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:35,441
I wonder why.

74
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:39,487
Maybe word got out
that we don't hire women.

75
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,823
Why not tell them we're hiring a woman?

76
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:44,784
Come on. We can't write "women only"
in the job posting.

77
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:46,911
Oh, please.

78
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,746
You remember their names too?

79
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,499
What was her last name?

80
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:52,834
Jang Ji-yeon?

81
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:55,003
Jeon Ji-yeon?

82
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:58,172
Hi, everyone.

83
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,883
He's a client here?

84
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:03,636
So she can be worth more and more
and sell herself

85
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,722
to the man who pays the most!

86
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:06,639
Yeah, well,

87
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,809
that's what every woman dreams of.

88
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:14,856
If only he hadn't smiled like that,
I might have held back.

89
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,036
That was fully intended
but not thought out at all.

90
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,163
But what's done is done.

91
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:33,333
What you need for a perfect crime
is a poker face.

92
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,584
What the…

93
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:41,716
What should I do?

94
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:43,885
Laugh.

95
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:45,845
-What did you say?
-Laugh.

96
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,221
-What?
-Just laugh!

97
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,236
Here, take my hand.

98
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:06,407
You don't see that every day.

99
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:22,340
-Jeez.
-That was embarrassing!

100
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:24,801
Why did I laugh so dramatically?

101
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:27,387
It was clear I was laughing
out of embarrassment anyway.

102
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:28,763
Darn it!

103
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:29,931
You know what?

104
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,435
Someone tripped me on purpose.

105
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:38,940
Let's forget it.

106
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:40,817
Yeah, it could happen.

107
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,903
It's normal to laugh awkwardly
when you panic.

108
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:46,823
Won-jun! Someone tripped me up.

109
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:48,741
Right, there are cameras here.

110
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:49,826
Can we check them?

111
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:51,661
What's your plan?

112
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:55,373
To play the recording
and make the security staff laugh too?

113
00:06:55,456 --> 00:06:57,417
Are you trying to be funny?

114
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,584
It's fine.

115
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:01,421
Just forget it. Let's do that, okay?

116
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:11,264
It was definitely on purpose.

117
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,019
Hello!

118
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,940
I'm sure you know Ms. Choi Soo-jin,
Korea's favorite actress.

119
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:25,236
Since she is our VIP client,
she will be sitting in on the interview.

120
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,071
-Okay.
-Have a seat.

121
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:38,291
Is there a reason you applied
to work at our firm?

122
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:40,585
Why do you even ask?
She's here to make money.

123
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:43,212
Yes, you're right!

124
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:45,798
Are there areas
you are particularly experienced in?

125
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,885
I've handled lots of various cases,
civil and criminal.

126
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:51,095
And divorce cases too?

127
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:52,805
Pardon?

128
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,142
Yes, I have.

129
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:57,310
Did you win?

130
00:07:57,393 --> 00:07:59,812
In divorces, there's no such thing
as a complete win or loss,

131
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:01,856
so I had a partial win every time.

132
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,483
In other words, I've never lost!

133
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:06,444
Are you married?

134
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:10,072
-No.
-Got a boyfriend?

135
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,116
We broke up recently.

136
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,162
We don't ask such questions
in interviews these days.

137
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,332
Have you had many relationships?

138
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,753
Is it a bad thing if I say yes?

139
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,796
No, it would be a very good thing.

140
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,673
You'd know a lot about relationships.

141
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:28,674
That's a relief!

142
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,468
I've had plenty of relationships!

143
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:32,428
Plenty? How many guys?

144
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:35,765
I haven't counted them
but besides the guys I flirted with,

145
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,767
about 15?

146
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:39,101
Are you a man-eater?

147
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:42,897
No, it's more like data gathering
about different types of men.

148
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:46,400
Let's hear your aspirations now.

149
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:49,320
Tell us your plan for working here.

150
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:52,532
They would all say
they'd do their best if given the job.

151
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:55,451
Instead, I'd like to see your talent.

152
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,078
What?

153
00:08:57,161 --> 00:09:00,957
A talent show will tell me
how desperate you are.

154
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,959
I've done talent shows before,

155
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,627
but they never did me any good.

156
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,430
Oh my God.

157
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,575
Anything strong? No.

158
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:36,909
I guess you don't have one.

159
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,453
No, ma'am! I'll do it!

160
00:09:39,537 --> 00:09:40,454
It's called

161
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,666
"a homicide-inducing talent show."

162
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,590
I literally want to kill her.

163
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:19,368
I can see it now

164
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:26,917
This is the last love for me

165
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:33,424
Please don't hurt me anymore

166
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:35,718
-Kill her!
-Kill--

167
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,970
I hate to see…

168
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:40,389
Oh my, are you streaming this interview?

169
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:44,769
Just a second.

170
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:46,687
One, two, three.

171
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:49,774
-Thank you!
-You're welcome.

172
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:51,817
-Can I take one too?
-Sure.

173
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:54,236
-Oh my God!
-Me too.

174
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:56,364
One, two, three.

175
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,199
It's got to be 100% for him.

176
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:01,786
-What is?
-Chance of sleeping with anyone he likes.

177
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,746
No way, not 100%.

178
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:07,625
Yeah, it would be unimaginable
for someone with less than a 10% chance.

179
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,043
-One, two, three.
-Hey.

180
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:11,796
I got dumped
because I was caught cheating, you know.

181
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:15,174
I made it to the hotel,
but damn, she found me there.

182
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:20,012
-Why was your girlfriend there?
-Well, because…

183
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,555
Wow.

184
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:23,057
It's not what you're think--

185
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:26,602
Take one with me, please!

186
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,896
I heard you were hitting on Ria
and got humiliated.

187
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:32,316
Off the record, it's the other way around.

188
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:35,986
Do you expect me to believe that?

189
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,154
Why would Ria…

190
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:39,448
Is that true?

191
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:41,701
-I'll take the photo.
-Yes, please.

192
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,619
-Can I hold your arm?
-Oh, yes.

193
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:45,037
Thank you!

194
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,539
One, two, three.

195
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:51,127
One, two, three.

196
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:54,755
-Thank you!
-Thank you.

197
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,842
I ordered sushi for lunch.
Is that okay with all of you?

198
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:59,844
-Yes, we love it!
-Enjoy, then.

199
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,220
-Goodbye.
-Bye, everyone.

200
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:02,805
-Bye!
-Take care!

201
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:03,848
Goodbye!

202
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:06,392
He's as kind as he looks, isn't he?

203
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:10,396
Good-looking men are the nice ones,
and average guys are full of themselves.

204
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:12,064
-Yeah.
-Like the attorneys here?

205
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:15,317
-You're so right.
-They look so ugly now!

206
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,652
-Thank you.
-No worries.

207
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:20,281
When a top star
like Mr. Nam Kang-ho shows up,

208
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:22,950
it helps our staff take
more pride in the firm.

209
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:25,870
Look at our female staff.
It's your lucky day, isn't it?

210
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:27,997
Can't you hear me? Oh, I bet you know.

211
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,248
Madam, I mean,

212
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:30,332
Ms. Choi Soo-jin is here.

213
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,836
-I didn't know. Why is she here?
-Oh, Won-jun.

214
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:38,382
-Why are you here?
-Wait, why are you here?

215
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:41,802
Oh.

216
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,972
I told you before
that my attorney doesn't get me very much.

217
00:12:45,055 --> 00:12:47,516
And so Mr. Yang here decided
to hire a new one.

218
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,435
A female lawyer.

219
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,398
One might think I pestered you for one.

220
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:55,483
I know.

221
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,749
Was it too abstract for them?

222
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,051
Excuse me.

223
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:33,145
Do you work here?

224
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:35,940
No. I'm just here for an interview.

225
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:40,069
You seemed to be okay earlier.

226
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:43,614
I was not okay at all.
I was embarrassed, so I endured.

227
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,616
It hurts so much, actually.

228
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:49,328
I might go to the hospital
to see if there's a fracture or a rupture.

229
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:51,831
-You can't walk if it's fractured.
-Is that so?

230
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,501
Try doing this.

231
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:03,050
Can you do this?

232
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,348
It's too hard.

233
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,309
Well, I'm sure it's not broken.

234
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:13,936
A minor cramp, I guess?

235
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:16,313
Did you take a photo back there?

236
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:19,066
-Sorry?
-A photo of me falling.

237
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:20,860
No.

238
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:23,279
Wow.

239
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,240
You must be kidding me.

240
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:29,243
Take a look.

241
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:45,551
Well, then. I wish you a quick recovery.

242
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:51,307
Going down.

243
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,814
So no photos, but she did trip me.

244
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,650
You could've talked to me
if you wanted a different lawyer.

245
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:04,320
How can you even think
about coming to this place?

246
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:06,655
You have to be careful right now,
you know!

247
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,741
Gil-mu's on my side though.

248
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,076
Are you sulking
'cause I acted as I pleased?

249
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,330
It's got nothing to do with me being mad.

250
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,666
Talk to me about everything, okay?

251
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,084
All right.

252
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:22,671
I never listen to anyone else
except you, Won-jun.

253
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,174
Hey, Kang-ho.

254
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,259
Hi, Kang-ho.

255
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:30,512
How come actors from the same agency
only meet at award shows and law firms?

256
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:32,389
Hello.

257
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,391
Shall we go for a cup of tea?

258
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,727
-I don't want to part ways just yet.
-What?

259
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,103
-Let's go!
-Just like that?

260
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,441
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

261
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:55,955
Oh, yes. Alcohol tastes best
when spontaneously meeting for a drink.

262
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,122
I want another glass.

263
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,540
You drank the whole thing?

264
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:01,794
Drink mine.

265
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:02,836
I didn't drink yet.

266
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,463
Why? Aren't you drinking?

267
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:08,759
-I need to drive.
-Oh, come on.

268
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:11,637
Hey, but why do you suddenly want
a female lawyer?

269
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,554
Oh.

270
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:16,433
Boys only try to kiss my ass
and are sloppy with their work.

271
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:19,561
Girls only try to act cute
and are sloppy with their work too.

272
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:25,359
Are you immune to girls acting cute?
Even when they're pretty?

273
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:28,445
Pretty girls are worse. They think
they can get away with anything.

274
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:32,533
That's why you haven't had any scandals.

275
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:35,369
Are you really not seeing anyone?

276
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:36,745
Or are you…

277
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:40,791
Talk to me if you have no one to talk to.
I love your type.

278
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:44,753
They understand all genders emotionally,
so a lot of them are very talented.

279
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,006
Jeez, I thought all women liked gay men.

280
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:50,926
Isn't it one of their great wishes
to have a gay friend?

281
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,636
I'm sorry I'm not gay.

282
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,722
Well, no need to be sorry.

283
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,057
It doesn't mean
I want to be friends with you.

284
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:00,644
Oh, by the way,

285
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:02,521
when's my party for the award?

286
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:04,606
-Let's set a date soon.
-How about tomorrow?

287
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,858
I have time.

288
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:07,401
-Huh?
-Tomorrow?

289
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:08,819
Isn't that too sudden?

290
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:11,071
That's my nickname. Sudden Girl.

291
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:14,908
And no matter when it is,
those who don't want to come won't come.

292
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:17,077
Hey, no one would turn down
your invitation!

293
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,037
He would.

294
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:21,540
He never shows up,
making all sorts of excuses.

295
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,627
We're in the same agency,
but we never even had a meal together.

296
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:29,173
And Kang Ho-dong said
that a family should eat together.

297
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,383
Oh, right.

298
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,302
Should we invite the law firm people?

299
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,220
It's about time we had a meal together.

300
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:37,222
Yeah, that sounds good.

301
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,059
Oh, but this time,

302
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:43,729
I think it'd be better for you two
to throw a party together.

303
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:46,648
Since our celebrities are all busy,

304
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,985
it's going to be hard
to get them together twice.

305
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,820
I'll have mine later. Let her go first.

306
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,531
I don't like it either!
You don't even party like me.

307
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,450
I doubt you even know how to party.

308
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,118
We all have different styles.

309
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,412
I'm not the type to party
just for my own enjoyment.

310
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:03,624
Are you saying I annoy others
just to have a good time?

311
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,459
Okay, that's it.

312
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,378
Stop it now. Okay?

313
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,174
You can throw your own parties,

314
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:13,967
and when your contracts expire,

315
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:17,846
one of you will have to look
for another agency.

316
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,015
I don't care which one of you.

317
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,475
You can both leave!

318
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,978
-Won-jun!
-Hey!

319
00:18:26,188 --> 00:18:28,690
Hey, we weren't fighting!

320
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:31,443
You know how outspoken we both are.

321
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,487
We'll be throwing the party together.

322
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,656
We are a family, you know.

323
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,785
Yeah. We'll do it together.

324
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,387
Can I go right before it's over?

325
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:00,305
Just to pay?

326
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:06,645
Yeah, you keep acting like that.

327
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:08,480
Until I get sick of you.

328
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,322
PRINCESS: JOHNNY'S AUTOGRAPH!

329
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,324
Is Johnny coming? He must be busy.

330
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,576
He'll come.

331
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:23,453
He's a good kid,
so he'll at least drop by.

332
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:25,956
Why? Does the princess want his autograph?

333
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:28,375
How did you know?

334
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:31,837
Because you only make that face
when you're texting with your princess.

335
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,630
Can you please do for other women

336
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:36,800
a half, no, a fraction of the things
you do for your princess?

337
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:39,011
That would make my life much easier!

338
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:58,030
I'll kill you
if you withdraw your savings.

339
00:19:58,113 --> 00:19:59,781
I told you I'll pay my rent.

340
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:01,950
I won't.

341
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:05,287
Putting money into my account
is my way of blowing off steam.

342
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,205
1,818 WON SENT

343
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:12,377
I'll kill you if you cause trouble.
We can't afford to pay for the damages.

344
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,171
I'd never do that.

345
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:16,298
I'm working out here to save the gym fees.

346
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:17,966
Do you have more interviews?

347
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,846
It feels like someone's nagging me.

348
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,765
Is it just my guilty conscience?

349
00:20:24,848 --> 00:20:26,683
Do you have more interviews or not?

350
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:29,019
I applied for two more
and haven't heard back.

351
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:36,109
Going somewhere?

352
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:39,238
-Convenience store.
-Convenience store?

353
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,657
Do you know how expensive it is
compared to supermarkets?

354
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:43,909
I'm not buying anything.

355
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:46,453
They've needed a night clerk
for a few days now.

356
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:54,169
Yes, hello?

357
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,714
I am?

358
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:58,882
Okay.

359
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:01,176
Thank you.

360
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:03,595
I got the job.

361
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:08,934
-Where?
-Gilmu.

362
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:13,522
What is it? Is it because of Lee Jin-suh?

363
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,400
You got the job. Are you going to say no?

364
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:18,944
No way. I have to work!

365
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:21,530
But why did they pick me?

366
00:21:22,489 --> 00:21:23,907
Of course they picked you

367
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:25,575
because you are excellent!

368
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:27,995
You are fit, likable,
and have a high win rate.

369
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:31,915
I've never seen
a well-rounded lawyer like you.

370
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:35,836
-So proud of you!
-You were just nagging at me.

371
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,587
Me? When was this?

372
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:40,590
Hey. What do you want to eat?
Let's go to the supermarket.

373
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:41,842
Meat or raw fish?

374
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:43,719
-Meat!
-Want red ginseng too?

375
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:44,636
Yes!

376
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,264
-Why is a woman here?
-They won't hire her.

377
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:48,849
I beat all those guys

378
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:50,559
and got the job.

379
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,396
This was the only place that saved me
when I was desperate.

380
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:57,983
As the first female attorney at Gilmu,
I'd like to do well.

381
00:21:58,984 --> 00:21:59,985
Go, Mi-ran!

382
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:03,989
You first have to agree to this disclaimer
before signing the contract.

383
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:05,532
Sure.

384
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:14,750
I will not disclose any information
related to my clients' private life.

385
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:18,337
I will be liable for civil penalties
for violation of the above.

386
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,172
I will also pay three times…

387
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:22,257
Three times…

388
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,925
my annual income for the penalty.

389
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:25,802
Do you agree?

390
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:28,472
Yes.

391
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,975
SIGNATORY YEO MI-RAN

392
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:35,145
Now that you signed the contract
and are a member of the family,

393
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:37,898
can I speak casually to you?

394
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:38,899
Yes.

395
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:44,029
The confidentiality agreement
is effective immediately.

396
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:45,989
-Keep that in mind.
-Yes, sir.

397
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:48,867
Now, I will tell you what you need
while working here.

398
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:52,245
Quick wits and patience.

399
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:54,915
Most of our clients are celebrities,

400
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:56,958
so they are extremely emotional.

401
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:58,752
They have serious mood swings.

402
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:02,172
They don't read the written complaints.
They know nothing about it.

403
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:04,841
You just need to be nice
and friendly to them.

404
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:07,844
Take their side, do as they please,
and they will trust you.

405
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:11,181
If you don't treat them right,
they'll complain right away.

406
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:15,477
The best example
is Choi Soo-jin from your interview.

407
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:17,187
Okay.

408
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:19,439
And she's yours to take care of.

409
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:25,737
Whether it be about the case or not,
listen to everything she says.

410
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:28,031
Do whatever she asks. That's all.

411
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:30,867
-Yes, sir!
-Questions.

412
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:31,952
Sorry?

413
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:33,412
Any questions?

414
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,458
-Are you Mr. Ko, the managing partner?
-That's right.

415
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:42,087
I thought Mr. Yang Gil-mu
was the head of this firm.

416
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:46,925
Do you know anyone who's working here?

417
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:49,928
I just heard it somewhere.

418
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:54,349
Well, you're hired,
so you should know who the owner is.

419
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:56,685
The man you saw yesterday.

420
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,563
He is Mr. Yang Gil-mu,
the owner of our firm.

421
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:03,066
Officially, he's the office manager.

422
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:05,819
A manager-owned law firm?

423
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:06,903
What? Got a problem?

424
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,281
No, sir.

425
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:13,827
Are you done?

426
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:16,830
Attention, people!

427
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:23,962
A female attorney has finally arrived
at our law firm.

428
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,298
Please introduce yourself.

429
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,551
Hello, everyone. I'm Yeo Mi-ran.

430
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:31,344
So energetic.

431
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:32,429
I look forward to…

432
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:36,308
working with you.

433
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:38,977
I'd like all of you to actively help her

434
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:43,815
so that our only female attorney
can settle in as quickly as possible.

435
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:44,858
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

436
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:47,569
Guess her age.

437
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:50,947
-She's my ex-girlfriend.
-Jeez, you morbid liar.

438
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:52,949
The one I broke up with recently.

439
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,618
You mean the hotel?

440
00:24:56,745 --> 00:25:01,166
Now, would anyone like to show Ms. Yeo
around the office?

441
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:03,376
-Oh, Seo--
-No.

442
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,503
I'll do it.

443
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:06,922
Lee, thank you.

444
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:08,840
Okay.

445
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,175
Oh! One more thing.

446
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:14,095
All employees are to have dinner tonight
with Dowon Entertainment!

447
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,348
-Thank you, Mr. Yang!
-No problem!

448
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:18,683
-You can drink again tonight.
-Ouch. Don't hit me.

449
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,609
Things got bad at my old workplace.

450
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:31,947
So I had to quit,
but it wasn't easy getting a job.

451
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:35,492
Sorry to make you uncomfortable,
but bear with me.

452
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:36,993
I won't bother you.

453
00:25:37,077 --> 00:25:38,745
I guess things got really bad.

454
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:41,122
I know you didn't like this firm.

455
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:42,916
Me?

456
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,334
I said that?

457
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:48,421
You didn't have to. I just knew.
But I didn't know you were cheating.

458
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:51,591
The sleeping room.
There isn't one for women.

459
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:52,592
It doesn't matter.

460
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,222
As in, I'm not going to use it.

461
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:12,070
This is our gym.

462
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:16,992
I'm afraid we don't have
a shower room for women.

463
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,160
Tell me when you use it.

464
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:20,870
I'll stand guard.

465
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,747
Okay. Thanks.

466
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:23,790
Cafeteria.

467
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:25,792
Drinks and snacks are all free.

468
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:28,211
You love booze.
Bring and drink as much as you want.

469
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:30,922
Nice!

470
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:31,840
Take a seat.

471
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:32,757
All right.

472
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,014
Aren't you busy?

473
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:41,683
A salaried attorney like me is never busy.

474
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:45,103
If a trial gets delayed, that's fine.
If it never ends, that's also fine.

475
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:46,938
Thanks.

476
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:51,067
Did you really have sex that night?

477
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:04,706
Jin-suh, I'm truly sorry
I showed up in front of you again.

478
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,374
But let's continue as colleagues now.

479
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:09,294
Attorney Lee, do me this favor.

480
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:10,545
-Do you mean it?
-Yeah.

481
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:13,340
-Do me a favor.
-You are so selfish.

482
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:15,508
Yeah, I know.

483
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:17,677
That's why I'm asking you again and again.

484
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:18,595
Oh, well,

485
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:21,056
I'm a chill guy too.

486
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:21,973
Thank you.

487
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:24,726
Is this what they call
a "Hollywood friendship"?

488
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:26,478
Oh, is it?

489
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:29,522
Get to work.

490
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:39,741
What friendship?

491
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:44,663
I'm sorry.

492
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:48,208
I'm sorry about last time.

493
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:51,336
I'm sorry about last time.

494
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:52,420
It's okay.

495
00:27:53,129 --> 00:27:55,131
-I'm sorry about last time.
-What's going on?

496
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:56,549
Is she nicer than we thought?

497
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:23,243
Don't close your eyes.

498
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,059
Cut!

499
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:50,186
Okay! It was great!

500
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:55,024
-We have no issues, right?
-No, ma'am.

501
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:57,777
"Action" brings out a beast.
"Cut" brings out a gentleman!

502
00:28:57,861 --> 00:28:58,945
My heart's fluttering!

503
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,782
The kissing scene was so romantic.

504
00:29:02,866 --> 00:29:04,701
Did you and Kang-ho make up?

505
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:06,953
Whatever.

506
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:09,122
He's definitely an experienced kisser.

507
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:11,791
But even the staff knows nothing
about who he's dating.

508
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:32,145
Oh shoot!

509
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:37,525
Even the pills won't work for her.

510
00:29:40,361 --> 00:29:42,697
He probably has indigestion.

511
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:45,325
He's gay.

512
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:46,409
What?

513
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:47,410
What will happen

514
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,205
if this gets out?

515
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,125
He's never been involved in a scandal.

516
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:55,376
It adds up, doesn't it?

517
00:30:11,643 --> 00:30:13,895
-Get in!
-Hurry up!

518
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,148
Fasten your seat belts. Let's go!

519
00:30:21,736 --> 00:30:23,905
-Let's go!
-Drink up!

520
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,782
-Ms. Yeo.
-Let's go!

521
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:33,581
Wow, I'm wide awake now.

522
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:36,125
I haven't upgraded my repertoire.
What should I do?

523
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:38,336
Don't even think about a repertoire.

524
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:40,463
Just dance your ass off
when they are singing.

525
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:41,422
Yes, sir.

526
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,383
Never forget to react humbly, got it?

527
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:44,551
-Okay!
-Yes, sir!

528
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:49,055
Clients share everything about themselves
with their lawyers, you know.

529
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:50,890
It must be so embarrassing!

530
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:52,475
Celebrities have it worse.

531
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,561
They worry their private life
might become public.

532
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:56,646
But if we lawyers only act gracefully,

533
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:59,482
they'll feel even more embarrassed,
don't you think?

534
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:00,483
-Yes!
-Totally!

535
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:03,069
That's why we have to act like fools
once in a while.

536
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:05,530
And build strong camaraderie
while we're at it!

537
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:08,283
-Booyah!
-So considerate, aren't we?

538
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:09,409
Oh yes!

539
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:14,080
Now, I'm wondering
if a woman can blend in with us.

540
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:18,334
Oh, I'm not exactly
what they call "a lady."

541
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:22,964
Hey! Let's fire it up, then!

542
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:29,304
Let's go!

543
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,598
-Boss, give me a dance.
-Okay!

544
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,520
-Hey, look at her!
-You know how to party!

545
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:38,605
What are you doing?

546
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:40,315
Y'all can't beat me in anything.

547
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:45,153
Whoa, hey! What are you doing?

548
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:48,907
Let's go!

549
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:51,492
Do I have to beat that?

550
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:58,082
You can hate me instead

551
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:05,048
So get rid of any lingering affection…

552
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:06,758
Thank God I fired him!

553
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:12,639
Don't you ever look for me again

554
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:19,479
Because I'll end up hurting you

555
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:22,815
Take it away from me

556
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:24,817
Oh, right. Hey!

557
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:27,737
Did you say hi to Mr. Do?

558
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,614
Gilmu's very first female lawyer.

559
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:31,532
She's Ms. Choi's attorney!

560
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:34,077
Hello, I'm Yeo Mi-ran.

561
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,080
-It's an honor to work with you!
-The honor is mine.

562
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:38,998
Please take good care…

563
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:48,424
of Soo-jin.

564
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:50,134
Yes, I'll do my best!

565
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:53,012
-I'll be outside.
-Yeah, sure.

566
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:07,652
Hey!

567
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,159
-Oh my God!
-Thank you!

568
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:18,579
I saw pink!

569
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:21,749
-Come on, now.
-Ask my manager to give you my pants.

570
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:23,501
There should be some in the van.

571
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:26,879
-Good job.
-Go and don't turn around!

572
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:32,427
Hey, everyone.

573
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:35,304
-Don't you love the vibe?
-Yeah!

574
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:37,390
By the way, we're lawyers.

575
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:42,186
To keep it just as interesting,
we'll now have the newcomer's stage!

576
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:47,275
-Do the thing from yesterday!
-Yes!

577
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,110
-Do it!
-You'll do well!

578
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:50,236
Yeo Mi-ran!

579
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:52,655
She really made me want to kill her!

580
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:54,532
Wow!

581
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:56,868
Top actress, indeed.
She copies it right away!

582
00:33:58,828 --> 00:33:59,996
Let's go!

583
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:04,208
Drop a bomb!

584
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:06,794
If I look weak from the start,
I'm done for.

585
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:10,256
What are you doing?

586
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:13,968
Are you mad that I'm late?

587
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,261
No.

588
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:17,680
Thank God. As long as it's not about me.

589
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,604
There's someone inside
who watched you fall.

590
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:28,024
You know, the freaking humiliating fall.

591
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:29,650
Then why are you like this?

592
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,069
I'm embarrassed.

593
00:34:31,152 --> 00:34:33,362
I'm the one who fell.
Why are you embarrassed?

594
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:35,782
Why did I laugh so dramatically?

595
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:41,829
Yeah, that was awkward.

596
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:43,998
You should be embarrassed.

597
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:47,168
You made a great choice
when you quit acting.

598
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:49,504
-Shut up and go inside.
-Yes, sir.

599
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:57,595
One of the hardest things to endure

600
00:34:58,513 --> 00:34:59,764
is embarrassment.

601
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:05,311
Squishy
Did you say my lips are like jelly?

602
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:07,021
What do I do?

603
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,481
What do I do?!

604
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:12,401
What if you come quietly to me
And beg me for a kiss?

605
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:16,155
What do I do?

606
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:19,117
How are you so good at guessing

607
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,578
What I want and wish for?

608
00:35:22,662 --> 00:35:26,707
Just like a magician
Casting magic spells

609
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:28,960
You grab me and shake me

610
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:33,673
I don't know, you can tell me

611
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:36,175
A thousand times, I still wouldn't know

612
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:40,304
I want to know how love feels

613
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:44,225
It's driving me mad

614
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:46,060
Noisy…

615
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:48,312
Don't get scared.

616
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:51,149
Don't get scared.

617
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:52,984
Take care of me…

618
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:55,153
If I get scared, I'll be a chicken.

619
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:58,239
Because you made me this way

620
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,801
Thank you!

621
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:23,139
You were great!

622
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:25,641
Nam Kang-ho, hello!

623
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,686
What is this freaky thing?

624
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:32,148
Shit, I shouldn't have tripped him.

625
00:36:34,734 --> 00:36:36,611
Well done!

626
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:40,031
-Hello.
-Oh, hi. It's been a while.

627
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:50,041
I am the best

628
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:52,001
-I am the best!
-I am the best!

629
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:53,586
I am the best

630
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:55,838
-Ms. Choi is the best!
-Ms. Choi is the best!

631
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:57,590
I am the best

632
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:59,675
-Ms. Choi is the best!
-Ms. Choi is the best!

633
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,469
I am the best

634
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:03,304
The best!

635
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:06,724
Open my closet, put on the freshest outfit

636
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:10,895
Have a good look at my face
I see in the mirror

637
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:12,563
Soo-jin!

638
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:14,232
I'm supposed to meet up at 8:30 p.m.

639
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:17,318
Walk into the night with sassy steps

640
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:20,112
What you men call "work life"

641
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:22,031
is full of flattery and peer pressure.

642
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:24,617
I can be part of those too.
I'm just appalled by them.

643
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:27,245
I'm the best…

644
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:29,413
Man, she loves singing so much.

645
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:32,083
But how can she not get any better?

646
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:34,001
Hey, is that her?

647
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,711
Yeah, do you remember her?

648
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:37,797
I do. Very clearly.

649
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:42,802
Johnny!

650
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:45,554
You have a singer's name.
Why won't you sing? Come on!

651
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,598
-Come up!
-Johnny, come!

652
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:49,267
-Johnny!
-Johnny?

653
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:51,727
Let's have a drink.

654
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:52,937
Come on.

655
00:37:53,729 --> 00:37:55,398
Hey, Johnny!

656
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:58,401
Kang-ho needs your autograph.
He's been on about it for days.

657
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:00,027
Do it now before you forget.

658
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:02,280
Why don't you do it outside?
It's chaotic here.

659
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:04,365
Don't forget to add a comment too.

660
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:05,533
-Okay?
-Okay.

661
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:09,120
He has a shoot in Jeju tomorrow morning,
so send him home, okay?

662
00:38:12,498 --> 00:38:17,420
-Yeo Mi-ran!
-Yeo Mi-ran!

663
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:20,923
-Yeo Mi-ran!
-Yeo Mi-ran!

664
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:45,906
I knew it!

665
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:48,326
I'm a good judge of character!

666
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,995
Let's all raise a glass!

667
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:53,080
Cheers!

668
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:56,250
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

669
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:06,719
What?

670
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:08,512
Are you drunk?

671
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:12,558
Come here.

672
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,186
I'll see you later.

673
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:16,270
Sure, get home safe.

674
00:39:17,938 --> 00:39:19,273
-Thanks.
-Sure thing!

675
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:25,613
Baby, you are so cool.

676
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:35,539
We're alone now.

677
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:47,551
Easy!

678
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,262
Sexual assault against a fellow worker.

679
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:52,932
-What?
-I'll let you off under one condition.

680
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:57,728
You and I are going to be nothing
but colleagues from now on.

681
00:39:59,063 --> 00:40:00,981
-Okay?
-Okay!

682
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,652
Go wash your face.

683
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:15,371
That's disgusting. Hey, get up.

684
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:17,456
Get up, jeez.

685
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,707
Hey.

686
00:40:18,791 --> 00:40:19,959
Hey! Wake up.

687
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:21,836
-Wash your face.
-No.

688
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,462
I won't, damn it.

689
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:26,173
What's wrong with you?

690
00:40:27,007 --> 00:40:29,427
-Wow.
-I'm not washing my face.

691
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:30,761
Hey, Lee.

692
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:34,140
Are you mad you ripped your trousers?

693
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:37,476
It's your fault
you lost rock, paper, scissors!

694
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:39,603
Oh, man.

695
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:41,647
Fine, I get it.

696
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:44,233
You must be embarrassed
in front of your ex,

697
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:46,485
but you were the life of the party.

698
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:48,320
You cracked everyone up.

699
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:50,114
Even your trousers.

700
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:53,451
Did you even open your flies
before peeing?

701
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:57,246
God, this idiot.

702
00:40:57,329 --> 00:40:58,664
But hey.

703
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:01,625
You two are over, right?

704
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,628
-Dang.
-What?

705
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:08,215
-Dang.
-You're ugly.

706
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:15,514
Come on. Where do you live?

707
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:17,016
I'll take you.

708
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:18,100
Hey, hop in!

709
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:19,310
I live too far.

710
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:20,936
-You should go home and rest.
-Hey.

711
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:24,106
Yeo Mi-ran, I'm the one who hired you.

712
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:27,526
I asked them to get me a female lawyer

713
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,778
so that's why they hired you!

714
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:33,032
Now, doesn't that mean
you have to do what I tell you to?

715
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:35,576
They hired me because I'm a woman?

716
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:37,453
Where do you live anyway?

717
00:41:38,204 --> 00:41:39,997
I need to go to the bathroom.

718
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:43,042
Bathroom? I can't stop you.
Come back quickly.

719
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:49,423
Soo-jin.

720
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:51,091
Are you okay?

721
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:53,010
I'm not okay.

722
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:54,553
You know how I am.

723
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:56,805
I act like I'm having fun,

724
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:58,224
but I'm not okay at all.

725
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:02,520
My, why are you like this again?

726
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:05,064
You haven't had this much fun in a while.

727
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:07,274
Soo-jin, let's go!

728
00:42:08,108 --> 00:42:09,985
Today, I'll drive you home myself.

729
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:10,903
Really?

730
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,364
You'll drive me home?

731
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:15,449
Shall we take your car or mine?

732
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:18,702
Either one's fine!

733
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:26,377
I was so happy that I beat all those guys.

734
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:28,879
This is the worst reverse discrimination.

735
00:42:36,637 --> 00:42:37,846
I'm sorry.

736
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,431
You don't have to be.

737
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:42,101
Have you

738
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:43,936
been waiting for me?

739
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:45,062
What?

740
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:49,483
No. Why would I do that?

741
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:52,027
It's totally plausible
from my perspective,

742
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:54,613
considering the vibe of your song earlier.

743
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:02,830
Oh!

744
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:04,665
That was just to--

745
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:07,001
You have a knack
for drawing men's attention.

746
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:08,669
What?

747
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:12,631
How can I ever forget a woman
who tripped me up?

748
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:14,133
Not in this life, I can't.

749
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:19,930
I felt something touching my foot.

750
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:22,016
Did you not feel my foot against yours?

751
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,477
This man is a VIP client.

752
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:27,396
What do I do? Should I keep denying it?

753
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:29,732
If you're going to keep denying it, then…

754
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:32,318
I'm sorry.

755
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:38,198
To be honest,
I stretched my foot at the wrong time.

756
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:39,992
I'm truly sorry about that.

757
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:45,539
I guess you can see
I won't fall for your lies.

758
00:43:46,707 --> 00:43:50,210
Since you realized
I'm a quick-witted person,

759
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:52,379
you must be a quick-witted person too.

760
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:56,383
Fine. You've admitted that it was you.

761
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:00,220
Now tell me if it was an accident.

762
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:02,931
-Wasn't it on purpose?
-Excuse me?

763
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:06,685
I've met women who'd do anything
to make me remember them.

764
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:12,441
I admit I see a lot of women,
ask their names, give them my autographs,

765
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:13,609
and take photos,

766
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:16,904
but I just can't remember them
because there are too many.

767
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:22,242
But I do remember those
who pinch, scratch, or hit me.

768
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:24,870
Because they are so horrible.

769
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:28,082
I'm not that kind of woman.

770
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:30,250
I was just stretching my leg,
and by mistake--

771
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:32,294
If so, you should've apologized.

772
00:44:33,295 --> 00:44:36,757
Am I picking a fight right now
with someone innocent?

773
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:40,552
I was going to let this go
if you apologized sincerely.

774
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:41,720
You leave me no choice.

775
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:45,557
Let's check the security cameras
to see if it was a mistake.

776
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:47,142
I think we will find out.

777
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:49,228
Wait, you don't have to!

778
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:54,858
I'm sorry!

779
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:56,193
I did it

780
00:44:57,152 --> 00:44:59,279
because I like you so much!

781
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:09,873
I like you very much!

782
00:45:13,335 --> 00:45:15,170
I only intended to tap you once.

783
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:18,173
I'm so sorry.

784
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:20,551
Kang-ho.

785
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:38,277
Be nice when you like someone.

786
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:41,405
Be nice, okay?

787
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:43,782
Okay.

788
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:46,034
I'll take it to heart.

789
00:45:59,131 --> 00:46:02,301
I bet I'm not the only one
who'd sacrifice my dignity

790
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:03,385
just to get by.

791
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:06,597
I won't ever be confessing my love
to anyone anyway,

792
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:10,017
so there is nothing wrong
with such a pitiful first-ever confession.

793
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:22,154
Where is everyone?

794
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:49,223
I know her kind.

795
00:46:49,848 --> 00:46:51,934
Pretending to be easygoing
in front of men

796
00:46:52,017 --> 00:46:54,937
just to seduce them,
depend on them, and use them.

797
00:46:58,148 --> 00:46:59,483
She said she's a fan,

798
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:02,903
but I'd prefer
not to get involved with her.

799
00:47:05,697 --> 00:47:08,075
Is there another woman
you've come to hate?

800
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:12,120
-Yeah.
-Come on. You're not like that to Ji-woo.

801
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:14,748
Never mind.
I just hate all grown-up women.

802
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:22,756
Huh?

803
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,716
Hey, isn't that Ji-woo?

804
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:36,478
Ji-woo. What are you doing here?

805
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:41,608
You've gotten prettier.

806
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:44,903
Kang-ho, you should take your gift.

807
00:47:45,904 --> 00:47:46,989
Have you eaten yet?

808
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:50,701
Why aren't you dressed warmly?

809
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:52,202
I'll give you a hug. Come here.

810
00:47:53,328 --> 00:47:54,246
You must be cold.

811
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:56,790
Let's get inside.

812
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:59,334
Let's go.

813
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:03,589
What the hell?

814
00:48:04,172 --> 00:48:05,173
-Bye.
-Good night.

815
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:20,105
Do I have bad luck this year?

816
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:27,154
I just hate all grown-up women.

817
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:33,785
Shit.

818
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:44,296
Yes! They are outside.

819
00:48:54,681 --> 00:48:55,933
What's going on?

820
00:48:58,101 --> 00:48:59,686
Here, take care.

821
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:05,525
That bastard's like every other man.

822
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:27,130
What the hell?
Is he an undercover president?

823
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:42,135
