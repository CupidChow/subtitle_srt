1
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,523
LOVE TO HATE YOU

2
00:00:24,607 --> 00:00:26,901
Why am I letting myself play this game?

3
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:29,863
Nam Kang-ho means nothing to me.

4
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:30,864
Ms. Oh.

5
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:36,244
Could I…

6
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:40,498
perhaps sleep in your room tonight?

7
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:44,085
-There's no spare room left.
-What are you talking about?

8
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:46,880
What would people say

9
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:49,215
about you bringing your girlfriend in
as a stunt double

10
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,301
and also having her sleep in your room?

11
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:54,596
Well, I'm okay with it.

12
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:57,057
You can use my makeup remover
and lotion too.

13
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,183
Okay.

14
00:00:58,266 --> 00:00:59,476
Honey.

15
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:03,438
Huh?

16
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:08,735
It's because I'm worried.

17
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:12,655
Sleep in my room.

18
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:21,372
Sleep in my room. And don't bother Ms. Oh.

19
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,834
No, really. It's not a bother at all.

20
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,169
I'm really okay with it!

21
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:32,592
Thank you, Ms. Oh.

22
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:35,220
Thank you for looking out
for my girlfriend.

23
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:38,640
Let's go.

24
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,352
Thank you anyway.

25
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:46,731
His revenge

26
00:01:47,565 --> 00:01:48,817
is too harsh.

27
00:01:56,449 --> 00:02:00,745
Did Se-na say anything to you?

28
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:01,871
About what--

29
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,331
About how we used to date.

30
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:05,333
Whoa, really?

31
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:07,544
Awesome!

32
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,551
After quitting college,
I met her at the theater company.

33
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:18,346
We were each other's first loves.
Our relationship ended badly.

34
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:21,224
It was a very long time ago,
and we haven't met since then.

35
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:23,977
Now, I have zero feelings for her.

36
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,188
Anything you'd like to know?

37
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:29,065
-No.
-Nothing at all?

38
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,024
Nothing.

39
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,694
That settles it.

40
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,071
Don't just stand there.

41
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,282
Lie down here and get some rest.

42
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,493
You want me to sleep there?

43
00:02:40,577 --> 00:02:41,578
Of course.

44
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:42,537
That's fine!

45
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,582
I'll sleep here so you can sleep
comfortably in the bed.

46
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,083
You have a long day tomorrow.

47
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:58,678
So comfy.

48
00:03:08,438 --> 00:03:09,480
Is it comfy?

49
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:13,860
Is it comfy to sleep on the couch
while telling a man to sleep in the bed?

50
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:16,196
You think this is why I asked you
to sleep here?

51
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:20,241
What kind of lunatic sleeps in the bed
and lets a woman sleep on the couch?

52
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:23,745
I didn't know you were so macho.

53
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:25,205
Look here, Ms. Yeo.

54
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:27,582
You are a patient.

55
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:30,001
You had 14 stitches in your back.

56
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:32,962
So if you sleep here, it means
you're trying to make me feel bad--

57
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:36,132
Oh God. Okay!

58
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:05,078
The bed is comfier, indeed.

59
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:06,829
Thanks.

60
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:14,295
Now what?

61
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,297
What's bugging you now?

62
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:18,549
You want me to wash up? Or brush my teeth?

63
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:22,428
Come on. One night without washing up
or brushing my teeth won't kill me.

64
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:25,556
Don't worry about me. Good night.

65
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,100
I am worried about you.

66
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:30,645
Damn it. I should have just slept
in Oh Se-na's room!

67
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:32,689
I still can't wrap my head around this.

68
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,607
I have never met a woman like you.

69
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:35,942
A woman like me?

70
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:37,777
Like what?

71
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:39,362
A dirty woman?

72
00:04:40,697 --> 00:04:42,365
Damn it! Ouch!

73
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:45,326
No, not that.
Stop moving around and stay still.

74
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,207
If that's not it, then what?

75
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:57,755
There were a lot of guys back there.

76
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,842
Why did you have to do it yourself?
You're a woman.

77
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,093
"A woman"?

78
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:05,471
If you noticed the danger,
why not tell one of the stunt actors?

79
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,765
Why did you take it upon yourself?

80
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:09,267
"A woman"?

81
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:14,605
Mr. Nam Kang-ho.

82
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,066
If someone saves you from danger,

83
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,486
are you going to complain
because a woman saved you?

84
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:25,199
If your life is in danger
and a woman comes to your rescue,

85
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:28,661
are you going to say,
"No, don't come. Why did you come?"

86
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:31,164
Why would you care
whether it's a man or a woman?

87
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:32,832
Your life is in danger.

88
00:05:32,915 --> 00:05:36,586
No, what I'm saying is
that you could have died.

89
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,796
And? If I die, I die.

90
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:42,592
Women are always damsels in distress.

91
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,802
And men show up at the right time.
Then pow!

92
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,388
I really hate scenes like that.

93
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:50,767
In fact, I don't like
the movie script very much.

94
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:52,435
What is that?

95
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:56,647
The woman is weak and pitiful,
and the man comes to save her.

96
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,983
It's super annoying.

97
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:05,198
But why is he watching the outtakes?

98
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:10,661
This is your second movie with Mr. Yoo,
and you don't know?

99
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,205
I don't know.

100
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,752
He's been inspired.

101
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,383
Looks like he's going to edit the script.

102
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:33,184
Sure, she can be physically weak,
but she even lacks the will.

103
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:37,146
Her man is wrongfully incarcerated.
She's forced to be the boss's mistress.

104
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,565
She should get revenge,
not just sit there!

105
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,861
Well, it's not my place to critique.

106
00:06:46,781 --> 00:06:47,698
Where are you going?

107
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:50,076
To wash up and brush my teeth.

108
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:08,052
This late at night
and just the two of us again.

109
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,763
All the way to Seoul like this?

110
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,350
Even the music is sensual!

111
00:07:17,061 --> 00:07:17,979
KANG-HO

112
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:19,772
Yeah, Kang-ho.

113
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:23,234
So she's staying in my room
because there are no spare rooms.

114
00:07:23,901 --> 00:07:24,735
Who is?

115
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:27,155
-Ms. Yeo?
-Yeah.

116
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:28,781
Do I snore when I sleep?

117
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:29,949
Huh?

118
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:32,535
Yeah. No. Sometimes?

119
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:33,828
"Sometimes"?

120
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:35,413
How loud?

121
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:36,914
Like an electric toothbrush?

122
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,249
Electric toothbrush?

123
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,501
What's she doing now?

124
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:41,586
Sleeping?

125
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,713
No, she's washing up.

126
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:49,552
Yeah? Then sleep in the bed together.

127
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,224
If you sleep on the couch
like a pathetic fool,

128
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,101
she'll feel too bad to relax.

129
00:07:57,685 --> 00:08:01,731
Lie next to her and comfort her
if she says she's hurting.

130
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:05,109
Caress her until she falls asleep.

131
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:15,870
Comfort her.

132
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,581
Caress her

133
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:21,584
until she falls asleep.

134
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,759
I'll call you when I'm done driving.

135
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:34,138
Shall we stop by the rest area
and get something to drink?

136
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:35,723
I'd like that.

137
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:37,141
What?

138
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,440
Oh, I must be mad!

139
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,442
Everything about him is attractive!

140
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:49,403
What's wrong?

141
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,949
I'm going to use the ladies' room.

142
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:02,083
Oh no, my bangs are all flat!

143
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,001
Let's see.

144
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,420
Like this.

145
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,777
First, ask a lot of questions
like you're interested.

146
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:33,698
You know, like which elementary
and middle school she went to.

147
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:36,784
And then casually touch her.

148
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:40,246
No, not like a pervert!

149
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:44,250
You know, like picking lint off of her
even though there isn't any.

150
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,169
And then, when the mood is right,

151
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:50,381
say stuff like,
"Wow, you have really long fingers."

152
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,008
Try that.

153
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:54,427
I noticed she had long fingers.

154
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,723
And keep looking at her hands
like you want to touch them.

155
00:09:58,806 --> 00:10:02,518
Even if you stare at hands in a lewd way,
it won't make you look weird.

156
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:05,104
And if she just falls asleep…

157
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:07,481
Wait, she could just be pretending
to be asleep.

158
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:10,109
So don't give up. Just grab her hands.

159
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:13,029
And if you feel like
you've stirred her heart,

160
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,655
tell her how you feel.

161
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:18,576
I'll win Na-eun over as fast as I can

162
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:20,369
and try to provide support--

163
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:25,708
Na-eun.

164
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:28,127
What are you doing here?

165
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,213
What are you doing here, Mr. Do?

166
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:36,844
I've acted in a way that would put him off
instead of trying to seduce him because…

167
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:39,889
I lost the will to fight.

168
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,850
After seeing Oh Se-na's true feelings.

169
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:52,735
Are you asleep?

170
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:04,622
Are you sleeping?

171
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,032
Does what I'm doing warrant cursing?

172
00:11:57,466 --> 00:12:00,302
It's just that
I've never met a woman like you.

173
00:12:01,762 --> 00:12:03,097
The type of women I know are

174
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:06,350
those who try to turn their lives around
through marriage,

175
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:10,020
those who try to turn their lives around
again through remarriage,

176
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:14,608
or those who turn their lives around
and then discard their men.

177
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:19,697
Those types are all I've known.

178
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,784
Women who only do
what's beneficial for them,

179
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:26,620
not do things that could
put them in harm's way.

180
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,753
We all work on our birthdays.
It's not a national holiday.

181
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:10,623
EPISODE 8
THE WAY YOU CHANGE ME

182
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,379
You have to have it your way, don't you?

183
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:20,966
You flirted with me
to keep me quiet about Mi-ran's deal.

184
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,678
And now you're flirting again
to hook Mi-ran up with Nam Kang-ho?

185
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:25,846
Don't you like

186
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,057
Kang-ho?

187
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,934
Why do you like Mi-ran?

188
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:34,188
Yes, my friend Mi-ran
is a fabulous woman by any standards,

189
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:36,774
but is she worth the trouble
for a top star?

190
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:38,984
Not just the top star but his boss too?

191
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:43,030
It's because Ms. Yeo
is a really special person.

192
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,660
I know she didn't like Kang-ho
that much at first.

193
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,579
Apparently, he was on some kind
of power trip.

194
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:54,166
But he didn't do that
because he dislikes Ms. Yeo

195
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:59,588
but because he is unusually wary
of women in general.

196
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:05,928
Kang-ho has done countless shows
with many beautiful actresses,

197
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,348
but he never had feelings for any of them.

198
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:10,891
Not a single one.

199
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:13,269
But somehow,

200
00:14:13,936 --> 00:14:15,563
he met the right person this time.

201
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:21,068
It's my goal to see Kang-ho become
a really successful actor

202
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:25,072
and make sure he becomes a happy man.

203
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:28,325
When you came to confront me
about the contract,

204
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,287
you were concerned for your friend.

205
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:34,415
I'm concerned for Kang-ho too.

206
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:38,002
That's why I was hoping
that we could be a team.

207
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:42,214
I'm sorry.
I was crude in my choice of words.

208
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,096
Na-eun.

209
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:52,141
Do you want to be on my team?

210
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:57,646
Kang-ho is not the kind of man
to break a woman's heart.

211
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,149
He will only have eyes for one woman

212
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:02,526
and love her.

213
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,455
Celebrities aren't all that, right?

214
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,957
As you can see, they are also human.

215
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,837
Well, I think he's nicer than I imagined.

216
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:23,339
Who, Kang-ho?

217
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:27,676
Everyone sees him as a nice guy.
There are a lot of nice stories about him.

218
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,012
No, I meant you.

219
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:34,433
When I read the contract,
I really thought you were a scoundrel.

220
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,937
But now that you've gotten to know me,

221
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,481
do I seem nice?

222
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,609
When you ask so bluntly…

223
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,072
I think it would be a lot of fun
if we teamed up.

224
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:51,283
The four of us can go places
and hang out together.

225
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:52,701
Oh.

226
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,537
That'd be difficult
if you have a boyfriend--

227
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:56,914
I don't have a boyfriend.

228
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:05,756
If I did, I wouldn't have let you
pick me up from the airport.

229
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:08,926
I guess not.

230
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:12,429
Do you have someone?

231
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:16,350
I'm just like you.

232
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:20,688
Oh, okay!

233
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:22,731
Hallelujah!

234
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:25,734
INCOMING CALL
GRACE

235
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:34,827
Yes, ma'am.

236
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,286
I heard about the accident.

237
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:38,580
I just found out.

238
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,457
She wasn't hurt badly.

239
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,752
You don't have to worry.
I'll call you later.

240
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,421
That's a relief.

241
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:48,340
I have to deal with the insurance,
so tell me where she got treated.

242
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:50,509
Yeah. I'll call you back later.

243
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:51,844
Where are you right now?

244
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,929
I'm driving right now.

245
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,015
Oh, you're still on your way back.

246
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,809
Call me when you get back,
or you can just come to my house.

247
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:01,812
I'll call you.

248
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:05,190
Mi-ran was correct.

249
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:06,942
Mi-ran is right.

250
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:10,779
It doesn't hurt to be suspicious
of men you don't know.

251
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:17,619
I know it sounds really weird
for me to explain this,

252
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:20,789
but she is not

253
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:22,958
my girlfriend.

254
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:25,127
It's weirder
that she's not your girlfriend.

255
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,295
Right.

256
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:32,634
I'll tell you now
so I don't waste your time.

257
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:35,971
I won't be on the same team as you.

258
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:40,476
Why would I be on the same team
as you and Mr. Nam?

259
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,103
I'm on Mi-ran's team.

260
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,507
Even the back of your head is pretty.

261
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:15,552
I wonder what's going on
inside that head of yours

262
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:19,098
and what you think of me.

263
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,773
I wonder if what I'm doing is okay.

264
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,839
Now I can do this without the meds.

265
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:01,974
And I can do even more.

266
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:09,606
What on earth have you done to me?

267
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:16,280
How about if we keep this going?

268
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:24,663
I like you.

269
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,248
Yeo Mi-ran.

270
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,523
Get the door. Someone's here.

271
00:19:57,237 --> 00:19:59,323
Oh, I slept next to you

272
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:03,327
because you kept trying to lie
on your wounded back.

273
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,828
You understand, right?

274
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:05,871
Okay.

275
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:09,666
I won't ask why you had to hold me
when you could support me with your back.

276
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:23,931
So-jeong was to be captured
and live in misery as the boss's mistress.

277
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:27,226
But the director will change it
so that she's secretly training.

278
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:28,727
What training?

279
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:29,686
Fight training.

280
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,855
She's planning an escape.

281
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,941
No. Let me.

282
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:38,445
She's planning her revenge,
to kill the boss.

283
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:43,867
How will she train to fight?

284
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:44,993
Is someone gonna teach her?

285
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,495
-The thugs.
-She doesn't learn.

286
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:53,961
Self-learned.

287
00:20:54,044 --> 00:20:56,463
So not only does the story change,

288
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:59,007
but the entire character does, right?

289
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:09,810
Are you okay?

290
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:11,395
You got hurt because of me.

291
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:13,939
Oh! No, I'm fine.

292
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:16,942
I heard you got stitches.
I'm really sorry.

293
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:19,278
No, it's okay.

294
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:21,947
Hey, be good to her now.
She saved your life.

295
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,490
You were awesome!

296
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:26,118
Wow, I'm such a big fan now.

297
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:30,080
These people no longer see me
as just Nam Kang-ho's girlfriend.

298
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:31,957
I can't do that.

299
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,710
How can I throw knives?

300
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,837
Don't you worry. Your stunt double will.

301
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,381
What about getting beaten up?
I have to do it, don't I?

302
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,008
That's also for your stunt double.

303
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:43,135
Getting beat up needs to look convincing.

304
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:44,636
But she's hurt. Can she do it?

305
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,680
Of course not!
Her stitches may split open.

306
00:21:46,763 --> 00:21:49,599
The director will push Ms. Yeo's parts
to the very end

307
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:51,768
so that she can film after she recovers.

308
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:55,689
Her sutures will be removed
in about ten days.

309
00:21:57,107 --> 00:22:00,193
I'd say she can start in two weeks.

310
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,405
She won't say yes to a bigger role.

311
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:05,073
She's busy working as a lawyer.

312
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:08,577
Even now, she's not enjoying it.
She's only here because I asked her.

313
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,912
Huh? She seemed to be enjoying it.

314
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,914
Do you know Mi-ran better than I do?

315
00:22:12,998 --> 00:22:13,999
Oh dear.

316
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:18,086
How come I know
what she's into better than you do?

317
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,756
Fine. I can at least ask.

318
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,467
Of course I'll do it! I want to!

319
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:26,636
The sutures will be removed in ten days.
I can start in two weeks.

320
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,181
Her sutures will be removed
in about ten days.

321
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:31,016
I'd say she can start in two weeks.

322
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:33,560
I knew it.
A master recognizes another master.

323
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:36,730
I wish it could be an action blockbuster,
like Mission Impossible.

324
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:38,523
That doesn't fit the plot, right?

325
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:42,110
How come I know
what she's into better than you do?

326
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:44,571
No, don't do it.

327
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:46,698
Huh? Why?

328
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,159
You're the type
who shouldn't do stunt work.

329
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:51,495
You have to be cautious and meticulous.

330
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:53,789
Dive in like that,
and you'll get hurt again.

331
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,123
Do you really want to die?

332
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:56,833
I don't like your tone.

333
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:58,502
You make me worry. That's why.

334
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:01,088
Even now, you're driving by yourself
without telling me.

335
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:02,839
I'll take care of my business.

336
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:05,926
We can't keep this going
if you act like this!

337
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:12,224
How about if we keep this going?

338
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:17,312
Mr. Nam. Don't get stressed over me.
Have a good day on set!

339
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:24,444
She totally heard it.

340
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:26,279
All of it.

341
00:23:26,363 --> 00:23:27,697
I like you.

342
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:29,324
Yeo Mi-ran.

343
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:33,245
There must be
a romantic bone or two in me.

344
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:37,249
But the life span of love hormones
is three months at least

345
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:38,667
and maybe three years at most.

346
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,670
Three years? No way.

347
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:46,591
Nam Kang-ho said he liked me.

348
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,680
You said you'd seduce him and dump him.
Looks like you succeeded.

349
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,181
Congratulations.

350
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,604
That is so unlike you.

351
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,274
You should be excited.

352
00:24:03,024 --> 00:24:06,570
Don't take me for a fool.
Things don't always go the way you want.

353
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:10,240
Those who think too highly of themselves
mess up big time.

354
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:11,992
You messed it up. Damn it.

355
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:15,287
How?

356
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:17,706
How did I mess up?

357
00:24:19,416 --> 00:24:24,171
Dude, you already got dumped
even before I got that call from Grace!

358
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:26,465
No, I didn't. She didn't say no.

359
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:30,260
But now that you messed up
in front of Na-eun, they will hate me too.

360
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:31,803
Like attracts like, remember?

361
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:33,430
Like attracts like, remember?

362
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:37,225
Nam Kang-ho might be hiding something too.
It might even be worse.

363
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:40,812
Seeing how he's so good at acting.

364
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:45,233
So, are you going to kick him to the curb
during or after the contract?

365
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:46,568
I don't know.

366
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:49,738
You're wondering if you'll dump him

367
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:52,115
rather than when to dump him, aren't you?

368
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:55,869
I'm just craving alcohol!

369
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,165
Should we have just one drink?

370
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,626
No way!

371
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:04,586
You can't drink until your wounds heal.

372
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:08,340
Also, I've never seen you have
just one drink.

373
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:09,841
One usually turns into ten.

374
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:12,511
I only confessed my feelings
because you told me to.

375
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:15,764
God, she was in so much pain
from her injury.

376
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:18,183
What possessed me to think
that was my chance?

377
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:22,103
You've shot countless romance movies.
Was that really the best you could do?

378
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,855
Isn't that Stone Age romance?

379
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:26,775
Talking to the back
of a sleeping woman's head?

380
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:28,693
Jeez, that sucks.

381
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:32,739
Oh, and you're so hip that you sleep
with everyone who flirts with you, right?

382
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:35,742
I knew you'd get in big trouble
one of these days,

383
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:37,035
but instead, I did!

384
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:39,996
The only woman I ever slept with
was Grace, okay?

385
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:45,877
Hey, stop taking it out on me, coward!
Call her. Call Mi-ran!

386
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:48,421
Meet her in person,
and say it to her face!

387
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:52,509
She's not answering?

388
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:55,512
How many times did you try?

389
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:00,559
Once.

390
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:02,894
Damn! Are you kidding me?

391
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:11,611
What are you doing?

392
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:13,613
-I'm making a call.
-Wait, don't do it!

393
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:16,032
-Don't!
-Hold up!

394
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:18,159
It's ringing!

395
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:19,077
Hello?

396
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:20,870
What now? What do I say?

397
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,038
Ask her to meet you.

398
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:24,082
Why aren't you saying anything?

399
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,334
Oh, uh, yes.

400
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:27,836
I'll tell you in person.

401
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:30,380
Where are you?

402
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:32,424
I'm in the middle of something
with Na-eun.

403
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:35,468
-Why?
-I'll ask her and call you back.

404
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,430
Ask me what?

405
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:40,932
He's asking us to meet him and Mr. Do.

406
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,185
The nerve of that guy!

407
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,687
What if we meet again?

408
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:48,023
Does he think
he can change my mind about him?

409
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:53,111
Are you saying that Mr. Do had Nam Kang-ho
asked me so he could see you?

410
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:54,738
What else could it be?

411
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:57,616
Nam Kang-ho can meet you alone.
Why would he want me there?

412
00:26:57,699 --> 00:27:01,286
Wow, that's ridiculous.
I can see what he's trying to do.

413
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:06,791
Is it a breach of contract
if you refuse to see him?

414
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:09,377
Oh, that's not in the contract.

415
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:10,295
Oh.

416
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:14,507
Then it will just give a bad impression.

417
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:16,343
By the way,

418
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:20,472
even after the contract is over,
Nam Kang-ho will be your client, right?

419
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:22,182
Yeah, probably?

420
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:24,184
Oh no.

421
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:26,936
Then he has to see you
as a competent lawyer.

422
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:30,482
Can you hold it together
in front of Do Won-jun?

423
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:32,609
Me?

424
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:36,988
Of course. I've already seen Do Won-jun
for who he really is.

425
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,574
So,

426
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:41,743
are you meeting them?

427
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:42,786
Yeah.

428
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:46,039
Now I want to find out
how strong your resolve is.

429
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:49,000
Thank you.

430
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:58,635
Wow, thanks to my hotshot friend,
I'm at Nam Kang-ho's house.

431
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:01,096
Can I take a selfie?

432
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:06,476
You're already so excited.
Will you be able to keep your cool?

433
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,061
I'm excited about the house.

434
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:11,398
And this is Nam Kang-ho's house,
not Do Won-jun's.

435
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:24,869
If you don't want wine,
then we have soju and beer too.

436
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,371
Wine's fine.

437
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:27,997
How about you?

438
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:30,625
She can't drink until her wounds heal.

439
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:34,504
Are you still with us?

440
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,186
Are you drinking that
so she's not the only one

441
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:52,105
not drinking?

442
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:56,443
Wow, this really is a rare sight.

443
00:28:56,526 --> 00:29:00,363
You know he's not like his image, right?
He has zero consideration for women.

444
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:04,325
You two are the first women to ever
set foot in Kang-ho's house until now.

445
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:06,828
No way!

446
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:10,707
I'll tell you now so you don't think ill
of Kang-ho just because of me.

447
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,584
I'm the type to flirt all the time.

448
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:15,336
But Kang-ho, he never flirts.

449
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,255
A wall. A human barrier!

450
00:29:19,257 --> 00:29:20,842
Kang-ho is different from me.

451
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:23,178
-What is your definition of flirting?
-Huh?

452
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:25,638
Why ask? We're adults.

453
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:27,182
Well, I don't know what it is.

454
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:29,350
Because I've never flirted with anyone.

455
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:31,978
If you're dating, you are.
If not, you're not.

456
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:34,856
But you've seen me flirt a lot.
With 100 guys, right?

457
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:37,150
-One hundred?
-Yes.

458
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:40,612
I don't have an exact count,
but that includes short encounters.

459
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:43,990
It's not 100.

460
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:46,659
How could she have 100 flings
and still become a lawyer?

461
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:48,036
She's been really busy.

462
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,455
That's what I thought.

463
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:52,874
Wow, Ms. Yeo. You're bluffing.

464
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,627
One hundred guys, jeez!

465
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:56,711
No.

466
00:29:57,921 --> 00:30:00,840
In my experience,
she doesn't bluff about anything.

467
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:05,386
She said she could do a bit of stunt work
but ended up saving a person's life.

468
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:08,973
That night when she drove me home,

469
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:10,767
I thought she was a pro racer.

470
00:30:11,434 --> 00:30:12,268
I almost died.

471
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:18,358
If she said she could spin hay into gold,
I'd believe her 100%.

472
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:23,071
You paint such a nice picture of me.

473
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,740
Thank you for trusting me so much.

474
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:28,409
So back to flirting.

475
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:33,790
If one thinks they're in a relationship,
but the other insists it's flirting,

476
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:35,166
is it just flirting?

477
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:38,878
The moment you tell the person
that you like them.

478
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:40,505
I like you.

479
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:44,551
From that moment, it's no longer flirting.

480
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:50,473
Na-eun, may I give you
a tour of the house?

481
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:52,976
The owner of the house
should give the tour, not you.

482
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,729
Sure. I'll show you around,
even though there's not much to look at.

483
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:57,647
Okay.

484
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,319
There's a lot to look at.

485
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:06,197
You've paid attention to every detail.

486
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:07,991
Did you do it yourself?

487
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:11,494
I did it myself.
I don't like to go out much.

488
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:14,414
-So I spend a lot of time at home.
-I see.

489
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:17,667
You are very talented.

490
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:20,128
May I sit over there?

491
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:31,514
She's met so many guys
and never found one person she liked?

492
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:32,682
Who, Mi-ran?

493
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:34,434
I don't know.

494
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:37,353
If you only try to see the good,
you see good people,

495
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:40,857
and if you only see the bad,
you see bad people, right?

496
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:44,903
Mi-ran has a tendency
to see all men in a bad light.

497
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:46,654
Why?

498
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,240
Mostly because she started off
with a bad guy, I guess.

499
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:50,992
I'll give it to you!

500
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:53,077
-Please stop!
-What's the matter?

501
00:31:55,747 --> 00:32:00,001
Mi-ran used to date a really cool guy
back in high school.

502
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:00,919
What the hell?

503
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:04,797
He looked amazing,
and what he did was more amazing.

504
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:09,802
But he ended up asking me out too.

505
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:14,474
He was a cool boy.
So I went out with him out of curiosity.

506
00:32:16,809 --> 00:32:20,647
I wasn't close with Mi-ran at the time,
but I felt bad.

507
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:21,564
Hey!

508
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:25,360
Why are you trying to look cool?
Take your hands out.

509
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:33,201
She's not even my friend,
but she's saying sorry.

510
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:34,243
What are you doing?

511
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:36,788
Yeah.

512
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:38,498
I'm sorry.

513
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:42,293
You can have him if you want.
I don't care.

514
00:32:45,588 --> 00:32:46,422
Move!

515
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,551
That's when I was smitten with Mi-ran.

516
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,387
I'm a person, you know!

517
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:55,390
So I dumped him right there
and started following Mi-ran around,

518
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:56,474
and we became friends.

519
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:57,475
Hey!

520
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:01,813
"A good person isn't necessarily
a good man."

521
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,691
That's what Mi-ran always says.

522
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:08,569
Whenever she tries dating again,
the results are the same.

523
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,949
Oh, it's not like she's loose or anything.

524
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:14,951
Please don't get the wrong idea.

525
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:16,160
Oh, no.

526
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:19,205
"She's been cool since she was young."
That's what I was thinking.

527
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:25,920
I regret having made this contract.

528
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:28,381
If I had left you alone,

529
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:31,009
you might have

530
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,011
seen Kang-ho

531
00:33:34,053 --> 00:33:36,472
in a much more positive light.

532
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:38,766
I think I made a mistake.

533
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:41,019
I was greedy

534
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:45,565
in trying to get you and squash the rumor
all at the same time.

535
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:46,649
Why do you think

536
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:48,693
I'm the one for him?

537
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:50,903
That's more puzzling to me.

538
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:53,156
You didn't like me at first,
and then suddenly…

539
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:54,240
I know.

540
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:01,164
It's because you're his one and only.

541
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,667
The only woman he has feelings for.

542
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:08,796
I'm telling you,
this is not an easy thing to happen.

543
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:13,718
Well, does Mr. Nam Kang-ho take…

544
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:16,846
some kind of medication?

545
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:19,474
What?

546
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:22,894
I wasn't meant to hear it, but I did.

547
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:24,479
Oh.

548
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:29,984
Nam Kang-ho seems different
from Do Won-jun.

549
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:33,196
He really seems to like you.

550
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:38,367
Mr. Do isn't such a bad person either.

551
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:42,747
Don't see him in a bad light
just because he's handsome.

552
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,589
Well, it's a form of panic disorder.

553
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:57,261
He has trouble breathing
in an extremely stressful situation.

554
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:00,014
And the stressful situation is

555
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:02,517
when he has to make

556
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:04,894
physical contact with women.

557
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:11,317
So whenever he shot a scene
where he had to be close to a woman,

558
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:13,152
he took medicine.

559
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:15,488
To prevent the attack.

560
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:17,740
Now I can do this without the meds.

561
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:20,576
And I can do even more.

562
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:27,416
What on earth have you done to me?

563
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:06,164
Amazing!

564
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:08,958
I used to do this with a drawing compass.

565
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:10,293
What? No way!

566
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:12,920
Do you want to see it?
Is there an ice pick or something?

567
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:15,173
Maybe someone has a pocketknife.

568
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:18,176
No. I mean it!

569
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:19,969
Bring me a pocketknife!

570
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:20,887
Don't do it.

571
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,347
Cookie delivery is here!

572
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:27,560
I baked them myself at home,
so please enjoy.

573
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:28,978
-Thank you.
-Enjoy!

574
00:36:29,562 --> 00:36:30,730
Thank you.

575
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:32,481
You were so cool earlier.

576
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:34,233
Thank you.

577
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:49,248
He must've been like that

578
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:51,626
after breaking up with me.

579
00:36:58,633 --> 00:36:59,467
Ms. Oh.

580
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:05,056
You want me to try some stunts myself?

581
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:06,682
Yes.

582
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:09,185
I can't. I'm not even athletic.

583
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:11,395
And there's no time to practice.

584
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:12,730
Not the cool action scenes.

585
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:15,191
How about the scene where you get beat up?

586
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:16,359
I'm sorry?

587
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:19,862
So-jeong is a character
who trained herself to kill the boss.

588
00:37:19,946 --> 00:37:23,032
She's well-trained in kicking,
punching, and stabbing

589
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:24,367
but new to getting hit.

590
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:27,995
So I don't think you have to try hard
to make that look good.

591
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,915
You've done more research than I have.

592
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:36,462
If you do scenes like that yourself
and not the cool scenes,

593
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:38,547
everyone here would be very impressed.

594
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,634
Including Kang-ho.

595
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:44,345
Cut! That was good. Moving on!

596
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:46,514
Aren't you threatened by me?

597
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:47,682
Honey.

598
00:37:56,857 --> 00:37:59,360
You were sleeping,
and it was to the back of your head,

599
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:01,028
but I shared my feelings directly.

600
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:04,615
If you're turning me down, tell me.
Why would you help out Se-na?

601
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:08,703
I know that Se-na is trying
to get back together with me.

602
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:12,248
But I really hate her.
A lot, very much, extremely!

603
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:15,626
Then you'd be fine
even if I helped her out a little.

604
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:16,544
What's the issue?

605
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:23,884
Do you really feel nothing?
Nothing towards me?

606
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:28,556
No. I feel a whole lot.

607
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:31,726
Even though it's a contract,
it's hard for an average girl

608
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:33,477
to date a top star.

609
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:36,605
It really sucks.

610
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:39,859
I'm well-off on my own,

611
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:42,570
but to be treated like Cinderella,
who is dating a star,

612
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:43,946
is a crappy feeling.

613
00:38:45,364 --> 00:38:48,284
Regardless of how I feel,
I'll honor the contract, so don't worry.

614
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:53,205
Oh, and you did nothing wrong.
It's all just my inferiority complex.

615
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:59,045
But I don't know how to get over that
because that's just how I feel.

616
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:02,673
If we could control how we feel,
life would be easy.

617
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:05,092
But it's hard because we can't.

618
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:15,811
I thought a job was just a job for you.

619
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:20,066
Us pretending to be a couple
is also part of the job.

620
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,401
So, why do you feel that bad?

621
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:25,946
You've done worse, like drive me home.

622
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:30,159
Are you sure
you're treating this as just a job?

623
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:31,911
No feelings attached?

624
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:39,919
Okay. There were many times
when I felt my heart flutter.

625
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:42,338
You tried so hard. How could I not?

626
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:47,843
But the crappy feeling is overwhelmingly
stronger than the flutters.

627
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:52,306
That means if I become a nobody,
we'll have a chance.

628
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:55,059
Is this a TV show?

629
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:57,853
Even for a script, it's a bit far-fetched.

630
00:39:58,437 --> 00:40:00,272
You are already who you are.

631
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,275
How could you possibly become a nobody?

632
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:07,363
It feels good to know
that Nam Kang-ho likes me this much.

633
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:11,325
So let me just hang on
to that good feeling.

634
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:14,662
Let's end it on a good note.

635
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:21,710
Class warfare seems easier.

636
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:23,879
At least we'd know we're being exploited.

637
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:25,881
But what if the enemy is your own family?

638
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:29,218
Through Eun-hee's life, we see how unfair

639
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:31,470
"family peace" is
in a patriarchal society.

640
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:34,807
We have to go now.

641
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:38,269
It's filled with insults
to me and my mother!

642
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:40,771
I'm going to sue you for defamation!

643
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:42,064
Sure, go ahead!

644
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:44,024
You better get yourself a good lawyer.

645
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:46,735
Because our daughter
will be representing me.

646
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:49,530
KIM EUN-HEE PUBLICATION SIGNING EVENT
CHEW IT TO TASTE IT

647
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:56,036
I'm a bit prettier in person, aren't I?

648
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:57,037
-Yes!
-Yes!

649
00:40:57,121 --> 00:41:00,291
I was blown away
to see how beautiful you are.

650
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:04,086
I probably got blown away even more.

651
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,922
I thought you were Mi-ran's older sister,
not her mother.

652
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:09,550
-You are stunningly beautiful!
-What?

653
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:13,554
Oh my goodness! You're too kind!

654
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,056
Well, people often tell me

655
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:19,810
that I look like my husband's mistress
or Mi-ran's stepmother.

656
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,397
-Stop it.
-But it's true.

657
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:28,861
Well, then. Congratulations
to Ms. Kim Eun-hee and her new book!

658
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:31,780
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

659
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:34,450
Oh, thank you so much!

660
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:37,077
I mean, to be sitting here
with superstar Choi Soo-jin…

661
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:38,412
This feels like a dream.

662
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:41,665
-Did that hurt?
-It did!

663
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:42,750
This is real!

664
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:44,835
It is! Oh my!

665
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:46,754
It's real, ma'am.

666
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:50,674
Your life will only get better,
thanks to your well-raised daughter.

667
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:55,763
Attorney Yeo's work is flawless.
It's very much to my liking.

668
00:41:56,347 --> 00:42:00,142
I'm so happy to have this chance
to do something for her.

669
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:02,770
Oh my God. And the book is so fun!

670
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:05,439
Thank you so much!

671
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:09,902
It seems she exaggerated certain parts
to make it more fun.

672
00:42:09,985 --> 00:42:10,819
Dad!

673
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:12,363
"Exaggerated"?

674
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:13,948
Which part?

675
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:16,951
Well, here and there. All throughout.

676
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:18,619
Here and there, where?

677
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:22,581
Everything she wrote was pure,
unadulterated truth as I remember it.

678
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:26,752
What do you think?

679
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:29,630
Actually, I haven't finished
the whole book yet, so…

680
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:37,221
Oh, but where is Mr. Nam Kang-ho?

681
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:38,556
Is he still shooting?

682
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:42,017
Yes, I think so.

683
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:45,145
-Did you have a fight?
-No.

684
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:47,064
You did.

685
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:58,325
-Yes.
-Kang-ho, this is Choi Soo-jin.

686
00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:03,289
You didn't know?
No wonder you didn't write a blurb.

687
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:07,293
I mean, when did you guys fight
that you still haven't made up?

688
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:11,797
Even Ms. Choi is doing this much for you,
so why isn't Mr. Nam Kang-ho here?

689
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:13,841
I thought he'd be here.

690
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:15,259
He's shooting a scene.

691
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:17,803
Are you actually dating him seriously?

692
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:19,597
You know, you're only getting older.

693
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:23,642
You take care of your business,
and I'll take care of mine.

694
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:28,230
He could have at least called,
especially on a day like this.

695
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:31,400
Men categorize women they date, you know.

696
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:33,068
Women they would toy with

697
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:34,612
and women they would marry.

698
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:38,365
What? Are you saying
our daughter is just a plaything?

699
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:41,744
I'm telling her to carry herself better.
Be more modest!

700
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:45,664
Oh. Where did Ms. Choi go
in the middle of a meal?

701
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:50,794
If you barge in unannounced,
it's all or nothing.

702
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:53,631
You could either make her happy
or get an earful from her.

703
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:56,091
I'll let you decide.

704
00:43:57,551 --> 00:43:58,552
Soo-jin.

705
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:03,140
-Yes?
-I have something to tell you.

706
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:08,228
I wanted to tell you sooner.

707
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:09,480
I'm really sorry.

708
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:14,360
I had no idea and acted like a fool
in front of Nam Kang-ho.

709
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:17,279
Jeez, you two
are making me look like an idiot.

710
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:18,906
I'm so sorry.

711
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:21,992
Then you should've kept it secret
until the end. Why tell me now?

712
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:23,160
It's making me mad.

713
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:27,164
I felt that you would forgive me
if I told you the truth.

714
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:32,670
Why do I keep getting treated
like a pushover by everyone that I like?

715
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:34,713
Who treats you like a pushover?

716
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:36,590
Let's head inside now. Talk later.

717
00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:38,133
Okay.

718
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:50,854
Hi there.

719
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:55,317
Soo-jin, it's been a long time.

720
00:44:55,901 --> 00:44:57,111
"Soo-jin"?

721
00:44:57,194 --> 00:45:01,281
I would love to stay until the end,
but I have another appointment.

722
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:04,868
Thank you for today.

723
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:06,995
Thank you, Ms. Choi.

724
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:09,498
-It was a pleasure. See you again.
-Bye, Soo-jin.

725
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:12,126
Thank you.

726
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:13,210
Don't mention it.

727
00:45:15,045 --> 00:45:15,879
Take care.

728
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:26,181
Well, would you mind if I address you…

729
00:45:26,265 --> 00:45:28,851
Oh, it's okay to speak informally, sir.
Please do.

730
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:29,768
All right.

731
00:45:30,686 --> 00:45:34,690
It is nice that a superstar like you
likes my daughter,

732
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:38,485
but she's very headstrong
and just isn't so amiable.

733
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:39,486
Please!

734
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:41,864
What do you mean "headstrong"?

735
00:45:41,947 --> 00:45:43,490
She's been so independent.

736
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:51,874
I look up to Mi-ran.

737
00:45:56,336 --> 00:45:59,840
So I'm learning lots of things from her.

738
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:07,347
-Such as?
-She's righteous and courageous.

739
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:11,727
She does good deeds
and acts like it's nothing special.

740
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:16,690
Once you get to know her,
it's impossible not to like her.

741
00:46:19,526 --> 00:46:22,654
She's the most awesome woman
I've ever met in my life.

742
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:38,921
Mom, what's wrong?

743
00:46:39,004 --> 00:46:40,506
Because I'm so happy!

744
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:44,218
Mom.

745
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:50,974
To hear that Nam Kang-ho looks up
to my daughter

746
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:52,935
makes me so happy.

747
00:46:57,773 --> 00:47:01,443
If I had heard something like that
just once from your dad,

748
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:03,111
I'd never have written this book.

749
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:16,750
-See you again.
-Take care.

750
00:47:16,834 --> 00:47:17,835
Bye, Mi-ran.

751
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:19,628
Mr. Nam, thank you so much.

752
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:22,422
Goodbye.

753
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:23,966
-See you again.
-Sure.

754
00:47:24,633 --> 00:47:25,884
Have a safe trip home.

755
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:27,928
Goodbye!

756
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:30,681
Have a good day!

757
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:38,105
The gangster movie scenes
must have rubbed off on you.

758
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:40,440
Are you mad?

759
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:43,360
No.

760
00:47:45,404 --> 00:47:46,405
I'm grateful.

761
00:47:49,616 --> 00:47:52,035
Do you want to go somewhere
and talk some more?

762
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:58,333
Didn't you come straight from the set?
You must be tired.

763
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:09,595
Let's go home.
It's more comfortable that way.

764
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:14,933
Your house.

765
00:48:16,685 --> 00:48:17,853
You don't want to?

766
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:19,897
-I guess you don't.
-I do.

767
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:27,404
I really meant what I said earlier.

768
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:32,409
That I look up to you.

769
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:36,914
And that you're the most awesome woman
I've ever met in my life.

770
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:44,671
I believe in quid pro quo,

771
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:48,258
so I'd like to return the favor
by saying something nice.

772
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:56,808
Even though I've met 100 guys,

773
00:48:58,018 --> 00:49:01,104
you are the first
to have ever met my family.

774
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:04,358
That's a great honor.

775
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:08,028
They are probably ecstatic
and getting ahead of themselves by now.

776
00:49:08,612 --> 00:49:10,322
Like we'll get married soon.

777
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:13,909
If one person changes her mind,
it wouldn't be too unrealistic.

778
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:15,786
It would still be unrealistic.

779
00:49:16,536 --> 00:49:18,872
-I don't plan on getting married.
-What?

780
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:21,208
What's wrong?

781
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:23,585
Then why did you date all those men?

782
00:49:23,669 --> 00:49:26,964
Meeting all those men
led me to decide not to get married.

783
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:30,175
However…

784
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:34,763
if I'm not going to get married anyway,

785
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:39,101
it doesn't seem like a bad idea
to date you.

786
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:42,813
I've dated men I didn't like before.

787
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:46,692
So, why not date a man that I like?

788
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:52,906
The thought just popped into my head.

789
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:04,084
How about a glass of wine?
Your wounds are all healed.

790
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:12,467
Since my first kiss was stolen,

791
00:50:13,635 --> 00:50:15,220
the second kiss will be…
