1
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,523
LOVE TO HATE YOU

2
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:26,693
A nice finishing touch for the last one.

3
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:36,661
Oh my God!

4
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:38,163
Wow, you're good.

5
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:40,290
-I did well, right?
-As I expected.

6
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:43,251
Huh?

7
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,795
It's Na-eun. Just a second.

8
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:57,182
Don't you feel like something's off?

9
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:58,433
Yes.

10
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,685
Hey, what's up?

11
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:04,522
Did I see it? See what?

12
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:05,982
I'm on my way there right now.

13
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,901
Don't go anywhere until you see me.

14
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:29,380
No wonder she seemed like a party girl.

15
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:32,300
He's been squeaky clean,
but now he's knocked out in one blow.

16
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:33,218
I feel bad.

17
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:34,928
What do you mean?

18
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,680
He had that gay scandal.

19
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:39,516
That was just a rumor.

20
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:42,977
He held out so long without a girl
and ended up picking a woman like that.

21
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:49,192
I should have hired someone
to take those bastards out.

22
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,780
Go home now, and don't take
any phone calls or exchange texts.

23
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:55,990
Don't even see Ms. Yeo for the time being.

24
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:58,159
-Don't talk to her either.
-Hey.

25
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,078
Are you thinking of cutting her off?

26
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:02,997
You gonna say stuff like
"Kang-ho had no idea. He'd been lied to"?

27
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:07,502
Even if those were all true,
Mi-ran did nothing wrong.

28
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:08,419
Okay?

29
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,131
Give me some time to think!

30
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:42,162
Jeez!

31
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,208
You have to let me win once in a while.

32
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:48,751
It's not over yet!

33
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:53,590
It is over.

34
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,925
EPISODE 10
A PASSIONATE GOODBYE

35
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,052
If you haven't seen it yet, don't bother.

36
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:00,471
And if Dad throws a fit,
just come to my place.

37
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:04,017
Oh, big deal or no big deal.
I'll take care of it, so don't worry.

38
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:05,351
Okay?

39
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:12,442
Let's go.

40
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:15,570
These people are not
going to look out for you.

41
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:16,821
Just calm down.

42
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:18,990
We're leaving.

43
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:21,075
No.

44
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,870
Stay with me tonight.
I don't want you to be alone.

45
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:25,330
She won't be alone.

46
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:27,123
She'll be with me.

47
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:31,169
I should go.
You shouldn't be alone tonight either.

48
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:32,712
You'll stay with him, right?

49
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:34,923
Just stay with me.

50
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:36,466
No way!

51
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,968
What if you sign
yet another life-ruining contract?

52
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,136
Okay. All right!

53
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,804
Okay. Let go.

54
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:46,851
-Tonight, we'll all stay together.
-What?

55
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:50,772
If we split up, we'll end up blaming
and misunderstanding one another.

56
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,441
All right. Let's go to my place.

57
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:54,359
We can't go there.

58
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,694
Reporters will be camping
outside your house.

59
00:03:56,778 --> 00:03:59,614
Did we do something wrong?
Why do we have to avoid them?

60
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,165
What did I tell you?

61
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,504
Do we avoid shit because it's scary?
No, because it's dirty.

62
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:18,591
Well, where do we go now?

63
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:24,639
My goodness. You drank a lot by yourself.

64
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:26,474
I'm sober now, thanks to you.

65
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,022
What will you do now?

66
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:36,985
I think we should just kill
those bastards.

67
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:38,861
Do you know where they are?

68
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:42,991
Don't worry. I'll kill them myself.

69
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:46,577
Even the truthful claims are defamation.
I'll represent the victims pro bono.

70
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,872
I'll give them death by endless lawsuits

71
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:53,042
and show them what it's like
to mess with the devil.

72
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:55,753
So, are you two going to keep
seeing each other?

73
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:02,135
There's a convenience store
around here, right?

74
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:06,931
Let's go and get something.
They should have a chance to talk.

75
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:12,437
You won't let them continue dating,
will you?

76
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:15,606
I know you won't just watch
Mr. Nam's career

77
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:19,027
get ruined because of Mi-ran.

78
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,030
Right now,
Ms. Yeo is in even bigger trouble.

79
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,742
Once people decide
that Kang-ho is a victim,

80
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:30,830
they will drag her through the mud
and trample all over her.

81
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:34,167
They won't stop
until she's completely ruined.

82
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,461
They'll have to break up, for now,

83
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,339
to calm people down.

84
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:44,761
So let's have them enjoy what little time
they have to be with each other.

85
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:48,681
I'm sorry.

86
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:51,893
You did nothing wrong.
Don't be sorry over circumstances.

87
00:05:52,643 --> 00:05:54,312
That will make me feel sorry too.

88
00:05:54,395 --> 00:05:56,105
For ruining Nam Kang-ho's reputation.

89
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,734
I can just quit being an actor.

90
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:05,031
You got alcohol, right?

91
00:06:05,114 --> 00:06:05,948
What?

92
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:07,700
Of course.

93
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:10,453
We can't talk over coffee at this hour.

94
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:13,748
Since we're all together anyway,
let's just have some fun.

95
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,382
-That's too much.
-Here!

96
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:26,511
Here comes the alcohol! Chug!

97
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:29,389
Wow!

98
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,975
-High-rise!
-High-rise!

99
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,395
Floor 11! One!

100
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:36,437
-Two!
-Three!

101
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:37,522
-Four!
-Five!

102
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:38,439
-Six!
-Seven!

103
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:39,816
-Eight!
-Nine!

104
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:41,609
-Ten!
-Damn it!

105
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:42,527
Eleven!

106
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:45,321
-Here.
-This is unfair!

107
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:47,824
How long will you make me
do the shoulder dance?

108
00:06:47,907 --> 00:06:50,159
Look at my shoulders. They're dislocated!

109
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,245
Please take me to the 11th floor!

110
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:56,082
Baskin Robbins 31!

111
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,209
One!

112
00:06:58,292 --> 00:06:59,961
-Two! Three!
-Oh my God!

113
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:01,421
Four.

114
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:02,839
-Oh God!
-Five!

115
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,424
Okay, pass!

116
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:06,509
Seven.

117
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:10,012
That was so funny.
She's really good with gestures!

118
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:11,264
Six, seven, eight!

119
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:13,349
Nine, ten, eleven!

120
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,269
Cute and adorably, 31!

121
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:17,437
Nine!

122
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:19,397
Ten.

123
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,567
Cute and adorably, 31!

124
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,569
-Nine!
-Cute and…

125
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,321
I'm not doing it!

126
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:28,322
I'm sorry.

127
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,661
Oh, not too much.

128
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,670
They don't seem like
they're going to break up.

129
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:45,006
They could be doing that on purpose

130
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:47,383
because they're worried
about what is to come.

131
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:50,470
Let's just leave them be for tonight.

132
00:07:52,555 --> 00:07:55,308
You're more of a lightweight
than I expected.

133
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,525
You really think about me a lot.

134
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,320
And you make assumptions.

135
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,531
But you're all wrong.

136
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:25,505
Oh, I wonder
if I can call a driver at this hour.

137
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:27,798
You're leaving now?

138
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,258
I should go.

139
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,844
It seems there aren't any drivers
around here.

140
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:37,016
Jeez, I guess I'll just sleep in the car,
sober up in the morning…

141
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,603
and then go home.

142
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:42,146
In the car?

143
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,440
That's too dangerous!

144
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:55,576
You can take the couch
if you're okay with it.

145
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:45,251
I can just quit being an actor.

146
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,576
So the party eventually ended,

147
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,496
and things unfolded as expected.

148
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,626
THE SHOCKING LIFE OF NAM'S GIRLFRIEND

149
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,336
NAM'S GIRLFRIEND IS A CLUB ADDICT?

150
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:11,462
THE BEAUTIFUL ATTORNEY WAS…

151
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,466
Wait until I get my hands on her.
She's dead meat!

152
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:16,926
Damn it!

153
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:22,640
Hey, isn't that Yeo Mi-ran?

154
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:23,933
-Yeo Mi-ran?
-I'm not!

155
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:28,854
Shit!

156
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:33,776
I warned you.

157
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:39,573
We won't tolerate our pure and innocent
Kang-ho dating an unlikable woman.

158
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:43,327
If you were that kind of woman,
you should have ended it sooner.

159
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,539
Are you planning on ending his career?

160
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,136
What I hate the most

161
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:04,223
is a bunch of women fighting over one man.

162
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:05,933
-What?
-Bullshit.

163
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:09,520
What is she saying?
She's the one who cheated. Unbelievable.

164
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,647
-Oh my.
-Wow.

165
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:12,773
Where are you going?

166
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:29,665
Your advertising clients have sent us
official notices, asking for 27.4 billion.

167
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:31,584
That's the estimate.

168
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:33,210
Don't worry too much.

169
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:36,422
They can't prove causality
between an actor's reputation and sales.

170
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:38,924
Will they disclose their accounting books
to prove that?

171
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,177
No way.

172
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,262
But they'll drop him
from their commercials.

173
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,432
Ruin an actor's career
so they could survive.

174
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:54,774
The movie's release date
has been postponed indefinitely.

175
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:02,323
There will be multiple lawsuits
from the ad sponsors,

176
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:04,742
and the assigned attorney
can't work on the cases

177
00:13:04,825 --> 00:13:06,827
because she was the cause of the scandal.

178
00:13:06,911 --> 00:13:08,662
They won't go to trial, sir.

179
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:11,957
Mr. Nam is not at fault,
so he's not responsible either.

180
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,709
Is that what a lawyer should say?

181
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,838
Guilt by association may not apply in law,
but it does to reputation!

182
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:18,839
Remember your terms?

183
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:22,843
"I'll be held responsible for a scandal
caused by getting personally involved"!

184
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:29,225
You'll have to prepare three times
your annual salary as a penalty.

185
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:33,062
And if we fire you, Nam will make a fuss,
and it won't look good for you either.

186
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:36,232
So I expect you to resign, yes.

187
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,234
Damn it.

188
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:16,021
-Hey.
-How far along are you?

189
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:18,107
Ten minutes left.

190
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:31,370
You made all this by yourself?

191
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,748
Of course.
You've suffered so much on my behalf.

192
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:36,500
This is the least I can do.

193
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,461
Come, sit down. Let's eat.

194
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:56,979
-Thank you.
-Oh?

195
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,814
I just discovered your weakness.

196
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:02,234
You're weak when moved.

197
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:05,070
I'm tough on bullies and soft on the weak.

198
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:07,573
I know. That's what I like about you.

199
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:19,793
How are your parents?

200
00:15:20,961 --> 00:15:22,713
I should go pay them a visit.

201
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:29,303
How should I act when I meet them?

202
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:31,055
Happy and energetic?

203
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,807
Or thoughtful

204
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:35,517
and dependable?

205
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:39,521
Wow.

206
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,399
Your face says it all.

207
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:44,068
Good, isn't it?

208
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,446
Say it in words.

209
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:49,239
Tastes like big franchise food.

210
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:52,576
It's a success, then.

211
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:58,791
Unless we break up,
the attacks on me will continue.

212
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:04,338
No matter how tough I am,
it will be hard because I'm a human.

213
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,926
And you'll never stop feeling bad.

214
00:16:09,927 --> 00:16:13,681
I'll also feel bad whenever you can't work
on a project you want because of me.

215
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:17,643
We can't handle that.

216
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:20,938
Instead of holding out
and ending up fighting,

217
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:22,481
let's end it nicely now.

218
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:26,151
I'm sorry to make the call by myself
so abruptly…

219
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,157
but one side has to take action
for a relationship to end.

220
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,493
Did you meet Won-jun?

221
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:39,206
If I had returned the money back to you,

222
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,917
I might have felt a bit better.

223
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:45,963
Never mind.

224
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:50,592
I'd promised to protect you, but I failed.

225
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,262
I'm really sorry.

226
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,847
Since you put it that way,

227
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:57,599
I couldn't protect Kang-ho either.

228
00:16:57,683 --> 00:16:59,476
He lost all the ads because of me.

229
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,272
Anyway,

230
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:06,191
I didn't come here
so we can feel sorry together.

231
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,443
I…

232
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:14,867
I plan on breaking up with Kang-ho.

233
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,077
Please look out for him.

234
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,291
-What?
-It's the best option for both of us.

235
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:23,709
If not,

236
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:26,420
do you have any better ideas?

237
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:29,882
I'm so sorry.

238
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,384
Come on. You shouldn't be like this.

239
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:37,139
Take good care of him, please.

240
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,894
It's purely my own logical conclusion.

241
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:43,979
It's my own selfish decision.

242
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,564
What if there was another way?

243
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:48,567
We could lie that we broke up.

244
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:49,985
What?

245
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,612
Let's just say that we broke up.

246
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,614
Why do we have to break up?

247
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:56,492
Why should we let them do that to us?
They're not on our side.

248
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,913
It's not like we're hurting anyone
by lying that we broke up.

249
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:04,750
I won't break up with you.

250
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:08,295
Why are we running this rumor?

251
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:11,298
We have to rouse public sympathy
so he can work again.

252
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:13,509
What about all the ads and the movie?

253
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:17,054
I know. We could have just said,
"Nam Kang-ho didn't know. He was lied to."

254
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,514
Kang-ho was not lied to.

255
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,351
They are breaking up
because of public opinion.

256
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:27,397
Mr. Do said to protect Ms. Yeo
as much as possible.

257
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,817
Don't go around saying weird stuff.

258
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:36,406
Nam Kang-ho and his girlfriend,
who've been at the center of controversy,

259
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,742
finally broke up.

260
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,410
People are assuming

261
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:45,541
that Nam Kang-ho could not tolerate
her promiscuous personal life.

262
00:18:45,624 --> 00:18:48,710
But there is a shocking twist.

263
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:52,881
The person who wished to break up
was actually the girlfriend,

264
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:54,883
and Nam Kang-ho did not want to break up.

265
00:18:55,384 --> 00:19:00,180
Unlike what was reported,
his girlfriend did not hide her past,

266
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:03,433
and Nam Kang-ho himself knew all along.

267
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:12,442
Kang-ho.

268
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:23,162
Kang-ho.

269
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:25,664
I'm fine.

270
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:26,915
You can go.

271
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:32,963
I know you won't find
another girl like her.

272
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:36,300
I even thought that maybe

273
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:39,595
you should just choose Mi-ran

274
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,014
and give up your career.

275
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:44,933
"Am I your friend,

276
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,269
or am I your manager"?

277
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:50,314
I've thought about these things.

278
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:54,443
I'm your friend.

279
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:56,945
No matter what happens with work,

280
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:59,114
to me, you come before anything.

281
00:19:59,907 --> 00:20:02,743
-Won-jun.
-Yeah, Kang-ho.

282
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:03,994
I'm fine.

283
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:05,787
So just go.

284
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:06,872
Okay.

285
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:11,501
-Call me anytime if you need me.
-Yeah.

286
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:26,725
It's hot!

287
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:29,311
You did well.

288
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,231
This place isn't safe, after all.

289
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:33,565
Do you want to go out?

290
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:35,442
Hm?

291
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:45,869
-You can start eating the gopchang first.
-Okay. Thank you.

292
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:58,882
Wow, it looks delicious.

293
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:06,014
Gopchang is best when eaten
straight from the grill.

294
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:18,068
MISSED CALL

295
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,116
Na-eun…

296
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:28,829
Welcome.

297
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:35,502
I thought you weren't coming.

298
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:37,546
Please sit down.

299
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:40,507
I can't be in company uniform
and drink in public.

300
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:42,384
Oh, is that right?

301
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,471
Give me a moment.

302
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,309
How much did you drink?

303
00:21:52,352 --> 00:21:53,687
I don't know. A bottle?

304
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,732
Actually, more like two bottles.

305
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:00,694
But I stopped drinking
after I spoke to you on the phone.

306
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,947
I wanted to sober up

307
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:05,949
in case you showed up.

308
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:09,661
You haven't eaten yet, right?

309
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,581
-I haven't.
-Shall we go someplace else?

310
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,124
Do you want something to eat?

311
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,711
It's fine.
You have all this food left here.

312
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:21,131
And I'm also craving alcohol
more than food.

313
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:33,310
Thank you for coming.

314
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,939
So, why are you drinking alone?

315
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,649
I just don't have anyone…

316
00:22:40,692 --> 00:22:42,694
anyone to talk to

317
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:45,030
about this matter.

318
00:22:46,281 --> 00:22:47,324
Other than you.

319
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:51,244
I convinced her to date him
and had her sign a contract.

320
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:54,081
Then a crisis happened,
and I told them to break up.

321
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:56,750
I had no idea I was this incapable.

322
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,002
And shameless too.

323
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:05,384
And I feel bad

324
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:07,260
for you as well.

325
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:10,639
No need to feel bad for me.

326
00:23:14,726 --> 00:23:15,560
Also,

327
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:18,271
it's not your fault.

328
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,662
Cheer up!

329
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:37,332
I mean, you have to stay strong
to take care of Mr. Nam.

330
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:42,462
Here. It's not the ideal situation
for a toast, but…

331
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:50,387
We should go now.

332
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,222
You leave first.

333
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:55,559
Do I go outside and wait?

334
00:23:57,644 --> 00:23:58,645
Just go home.

335
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:01,022
Then let's stay here a while longer.

336
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:03,817
Okay.

337
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,320
-You don't go home after a drink, do you?
-Most of the time, no.

338
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:08,363
Where do you go?

339
00:24:09,030 --> 00:24:10,115
Karaoke?

340
00:24:10,198 --> 00:24:11,032
Karaoke?

341
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:13,702
Isn't that doable?

342
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:30,927
Hey, I'm in room number two.

343
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,226
Hey! Over there!

344
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,978
-What? What is it?
-What?

345
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:42,355
-Isn't that Nam Kang-ho?
-It's Nam Kang-ho.

346
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:44,024
I know, right?

347
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:50,989
-But I was wrong about everything.
-I'm sorry?

348
00:24:51,072 --> 00:24:54,284
You didn't seem like the type
to drink alone at a place like this.

349
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:56,703
What's wrong with a place like this?

350
00:24:56,786 --> 00:25:00,790
Drinking at a place like this
is the best way to drink.

351
00:25:01,333 --> 00:25:04,628
Hotel lounges?
They are the worst, you know?

352
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:06,963
I'd rather just drink
at a tteokbokki place.

353
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:08,840
Tteokbokki and beer are my favorites.

354
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,842
-Really?
-Yes!

355
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:13,720
Then tteokbokki and beer for round two?

356
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:14,971
I'm in!

357
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,902
-This is it!
-Wow, it's awesome.

358
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:35,784
I decided to remain
just friends with Grace.

359
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:38,036
I see.

360
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,206
Can we meet again?

361
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:47,045
You know, meet like this sometimes
and have tteokbokki and beer together.

362
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,214
What do I tell Mi-ran?

363
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:52,133
I guess that'd be awkward.

364
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:53,969
Not just awkward. It's not right.

365
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:56,388
-We can't rub it in their faces.
-You're right.

366
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:58,139
That wouldn't be right.

367
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,643
Poor Kang-ho.

368
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:05,021
He can't see the woman he loves.

369
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:07,524
And for me to meet you
just because I want to see you…

370
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:11,361
Well, since this is our last time,

371
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:14,698
I'll say everything that's on my mind.

372
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,493
I have feelings for you.

373
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,418
Oh, please…

374
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:28,837
We won't be meeting again, so why bother?

375
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:32,507
Stop saying silly things,
and let's end this on a good note.

376
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:36,595
Wait, I just confessed my feelings.
How could you say that's silly?

377
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:39,139
That's so mean.

378
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:41,558
If we meet in our next life,
you can give it a try.

379
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:45,395
"Next life"?

380
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:47,105
You have a crush on me

381
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:51,484
Those vague eyes of yours
What are they saying?

382
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:53,194
You have a crush on me

383
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:57,032
Show me your dance, come on!

384
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:03,788
The sparkling flame of passion

385
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:06,541
Oh, stand by me

386
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:10,170
Stand by me, stand by me

387
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:12,255
If you want

388
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:16,968
I'll give you the stars of the night sky

389
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:19,054
Oh, stand by me

390
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:22,557
Stand by me, stand by me

391
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:25,977
Kiss me on the cheek

392
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,812
Oh, yeah

393
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:32,442
It's 100%. Wait until she comes.

394
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:34,319
-Hey, here she comes.
-Attorney?

395
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:37,489
You're an attorney, right?

396
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:41,117
I am. Why do you ask?

397
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:43,370
-It really is her!
-I told you!

398
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:44,663
They didn't break up!

399
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:46,748
-That's crazy.
-They were on a date?

400
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:50,043
Man, Kang-ho's reputation is ruined!
They even released a statement.

401
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:51,127
It's Nam Kang-ho!

402
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:52,462
It's him!

403
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:53,546
Oh my!

404
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:58,009
-Didn't you break up with her?
-They didn't break up!

405
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,261
-Kang-ho!
-Let us through.

406
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:01,680
Passing through.

407
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:03,556
How did he get caught by such a woman?

408
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,683
What did you say?

409
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:06,059
Don't. Let's just go.

410
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:08,395
Why won't you leave him?
Your past is exposed.

411
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:09,646
Goddamn it.

412
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,029
What about my past?

413
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,323
That I dated a lot of men?

414
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:25,161
If you date just one or two men and say
you found your match, is that good?

415
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:26,705
That's being rash.

416
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:28,248
At least I was prudent.

417
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:30,583
All right?

418
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:33,962
-Let's go.
-She's a piece of work.

419
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,296
So aggressive.

420
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,549
She'll probably walk all over Kang-ho too!

421
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:39,300
At least I was prudent.

422
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:41,469
All right?

423
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:43,179
Let's go.

424
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:46,141
She really is something else, isn't she?

425
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:49,894
I mean, I can't believe
she had the nerve to say that!

426
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:53,231
She should have apologized there
for lying about the breakup.

427
00:28:53,314 --> 00:28:54,649
But to pick a fight?

428
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,235
Yeah, okay.
Let's say the woman is just a gold digger.

429
00:28:57,902 --> 00:29:00,989
But Nam Kang-ho,
how can you deceive your fans like this?

430
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:06,161
Mom!

431
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,250
Why would he yell at you?

432
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,961
You didn't make me who I am.
If anything, it's Dad's fault!

433
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:17,255
I'm sure he was just worried

434
00:29:17,338 --> 00:29:19,549
that something might happen
to his only daughter.

435
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:21,801
But why take it out on her?

436
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:24,137
It's because he thinks
Mom is easy to pick on.

437
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,096
Don't go home.

438
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,640
If you go back too soon,
that would be even worse!

439
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:28,558
What about you?

440
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:30,643
Are you doing okay?

441
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:32,145
Me?

442
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:34,314
Of course I'm fine!

443
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:36,232
What, did anybody die?

444
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:40,153
Even if I'm on your side,
I am really upset this time.

445
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:42,947
Why does my baby have to suffer
this humiliation because of him?

446
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:46,951
I won't go back home,
so you stop seeing him too.

447
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:53,124
You should have at least told me.

448
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,084
I'm sorry.

449
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:57,670
I wanted to protect you and Mi-ran
as much as I could!

450
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:01,633
But you ended up ruining Mi-ran as well.

451
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:05,303
Won-jun.

452
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:09,015
What do I do now?

453
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:14,896
You're on your own.

454
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:19,484
You said you're my friend.

455
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:43,800
You arrived right on time.

456
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:45,468
We can eat now, right?

457
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:46,970
Yes, enjoy your meal.

458
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:49,013
Go on. Eat.

459
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,181
As much as you want.

460
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:55,103
Soo-jin, can you be seen
with me like this?

461
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:58,314
I feel like
people will recognize who I am.

462
00:30:58,398 --> 00:30:59,482
So, what if they do?

463
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:03,903
Are they going to say a cheating woman
and a succubus are hanging out together?

464
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:07,574
You spoke up so proudly yesterday,
so why are you scared now?

465
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:10,243
I'm worried
that I might cause trouble for you.

466
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:13,121
Won-jun alone is enough
for worrying about such things.

467
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:21,838
I like Won-jun,
but I can't live like he wants me to.

468
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:23,756
I can stand other people hating me,

469
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:26,259
but I can't live with hating myself.

470
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:30,263
Living in fear
of what others might think of me?

471
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:32,640
Ugh, that's gross!

472
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:37,478
I don't care about what other people think
of me taking your side.

473
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,900
I just don't want you to be scared.
It's not like you.

474
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:50,158
-Yes, Sang-sup?
-Soo-jin.

475
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:53,453
Do you happen to know
where Ms. Yeo is right now?

476
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:56,414
Kang-ho just announced
that he'll hold a press conference.

477
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:00,460
I just don't understand what that means.
He didn't say a word to us.

478
00:32:00,543 --> 00:32:02,378
Press conference?

479
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:03,755
Did he not contact you?

480
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:10,762
NAM KANG-HO
MISSED CALL

481
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:21,189
He's here.

482
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:38,873
Hello.

483
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:43,127
I want to thank and apologize
to everyone who came on such short notice.

484
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:45,713
Is it okay if we stream this live?

485
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:48,758
Yes, by all means. Go ahead.

486
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:52,470
Are you back with her again?

487
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:54,097
Did you even break up?

488
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:56,224
Did you not break up at all
from the start?

489
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,434
Right. That's correct.

490
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:02,814
We did not break up for a single moment.

491
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:06,693
I'm sorry for lying.

492
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:11,906
LIVE BREAKING NEWS!
NAM KANG-HO PRESS CONFERENCE

493
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:19,580
And if our relationship disappointed those
who have given me so much love,

494
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:21,332
I apologize.

495
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:27,380
But I can't give up on the woman I love

496
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:31,009
just because I feel bad for you.

497
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:32,927
What?

498
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:36,639
He must be mad!

499
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:38,683
What is he saying right now?

500
00:33:38,766 --> 00:33:40,476
He says he can't give up on her.

501
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:43,563
So I'd like to take this opportunity

502
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:45,440
and ask her to marry me.

503
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:54,449
Are you watching?

504
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,369
I know you told me not to feel sorry
over circumstances.

505
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:04,333
But I'm so sorry.

506
00:34:05,543 --> 00:34:07,170
I'll make it up to you from now on.

507
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:10,798
So marry me.

508
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:14,969
I love you.

509
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:15,970
Wait!

510
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:51,339
Among the countless men I've dated,
Mr. Nam Kang-ho…

511
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:55,593
was the best man, without a doubt.

512
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,262
He is a really nice person.

513
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:01,224
And I will never forget someone…

514
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,151
who has gone this far for me.

515
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:17,281
No matter what people think of me,
I don't feel ashamed.

516
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:20,284
But I can't stand to watch
Mr. Nam get hurt because of me.

517
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:24,664
So…

518
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:33,214
Let's end our relationship here.

519
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:35,174
What?

520
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:37,426
"I must leave you because I love you."

521
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:42,306
I used to think
that was such a silly thing to say.

522
00:35:45,226 --> 00:35:46,561
But apparently,

523
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:48,896
it can happen.

524
00:35:56,821 --> 00:36:00,241
We've had a good run.
So let's have a great farewell.

525
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:07,081
Faced with the cold reality,

526
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,418
we had a passionate goodbye.

527
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:13,212
That woman was something else, huh?

528
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:15,131
Only a man like Nam Kang-ho
can handle her.

529
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:18,217
Yeah? I thought she was kind of cool.

530
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:20,219
I kind of want to date someone like her.

531
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:22,138
Right, you can date someone like her.

532
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:24,056
But how can you marry a woman like that?

533
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:27,435
Honestly, what's so wrong
about dating a lot of men?

534
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:28,936
Older people don't like that.

535
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:32,023
My mom said dating a lot of guys
would help me choose the right one.

536
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:33,524
So that's what she did.

537
00:36:34,025 --> 00:36:36,861
-Nam Kang-ho is freaking awesome!
-I know.

538
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:44,619
Sir. Aren't you going home?

539
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:47,788
Are you still here?

540
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:49,624
Go home now.

541
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:52,043
Do you want the light on?

542
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:53,044
Leave it.

543
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:54,378
Yes, sir.

544
00:36:59,133 --> 00:36:59,967
Hey, Sang-sup.

545
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:01,469
Yes, sir.

546
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:07,350
-Do you have any smokes?
-Yes.

547
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:11,771
Thank you.

548
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:55,106
That's enough.

549
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:59,986
I will get better after three months.

550
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:03,531
Right?

551
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:09,829
This is all because of
those Expose TV assholes.

552
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:12,290
I'm going to kill them. Shit.

553
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:15,126
Hey!

554
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:17,670
You're going to really kill someone
if you go there now!

555
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:18,587
Please calm down.

556
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:40,818
Shouldn't I see him
at least once before I die?

557
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:42,320
You won't die from a cold.

558
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:44,530
Take your medicine.

559
00:38:58,085 --> 00:39:00,004
I shouldn't have done that.

560
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:05,801
Why did I do that in public?

561
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:12,558
That was the first time.

562
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:18,064
The first time I saw Mi-ran cry.

563
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:47,843
Jeez, look at these lemmings.

564
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:50,054
They couldn't hate her enough,

565
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:52,390
and now they hate us
because they pity her.

566
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:53,641
Well, fine.

567
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:57,019
Now that the stage is bigger,
this additional reveal is going to be fun.

568
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:59,313
Are we going to top
our viewership record today?

569
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:01,232
Hello.

570
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:03,359
-Hello!
-Hello!

571
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:04,902
-Hello!
-Welcome.

572
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:06,654
-Hello.
-Hello.

573
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,155
Have a seat. Nice to meet you!

574
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,240
Nice to meet you too.

575
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:10,741
What's that supposed to mean?

576
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:14,412
Oh, I don't know.
Hang up the phone and just watch it!

577
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:25,506
How will you prove
that you're the ex-boyfriend

578
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:27,007
of Nam Kang-ho's ex-girlfriend?

579
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:28,426
We're law school classmates.

580
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:31,429
I'm sure our friends are watching.
You can ask any one of them.

581
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:32,596
Okay, sure.

582
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:36,308
We understand that she was quite famous
back in law school, yes?

583
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:39,103
God, she was very famous.
She was super popular.

584
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:40,521
Among the guys too?

585
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:42,022
Yes, among the guys too.

586
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:43,482
In what way was she popular?

587
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:46,777
Why don't you hear from the witnesses
instead of me?

588
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:48,028
Holy shit!

589
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:52,199
I found out later that the asshole was set
to marry someone in a month.

590
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,118
So I was dumbfounded.

591
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:57,496
Well, Mi-ran seduced that guy
in that month's time

592
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,081
and crashed their engagement.

593
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:02,418
It was the most satisfying thing
in my whole life.

594
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:06,005
I heard she doles out punishments
to bad guys.

595
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:08,507
So I told her
that I had been abused by my boyfriend,

596
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:10,426
and I don't know how she did it,

597
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:13,053
but he showed up with bruises
on his face a few days later.

598
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:16,223
He was too embarrassed to admit
that he got beat up by a woman.

599
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:19,810
She was a real hero among the girls.

600
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:21,437
It's like a talent donation.

601
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:25,024
She uses her gift as a pickup artist
to administer justice.

602
00:41:25,107 --> 00:41:27,651
I bet none of the guys who dated her
will come forward.

603
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:30,738
They all deserved what they got.

604
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:32,698
But I am not like that.

605
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:35,284
I bet I was probably the nicest guy.

606
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:36,952
That's why we still get along fine.

607
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:38,204
Wait a minute.

608
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,749
-Let's stop for a minute.
-Why?

609
00:41:42,374 --> 00:41:43,876
You said you'd expose her true nature.

610
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:46,545
Here it is.

611
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:49,924
No, that's not it. Hang on a second. Okay.

612
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:53,010
Wait, I believe there's something wrong
with the footage…

613
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:54,803
I did the video editing.

614
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:57,681
Impressive as usual, Seo!

615
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:00,434
Oh, I'm pretty good, aren't I?

616
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:02,102
It was good.

617
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:03,771
I underestimated men.

618
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:05,856
I don't care if they bluff.

619
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:09,109
The loyalty they showed was awesome!

620
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:13,697
HER TRUTH, SHE WAS A REAL HERO
EXPOSE TV'S WITCH HUNT. IS IT OKAY?

621
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:14,615
NAM KNEW ALL ALONG

622
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:17,868
PROTESTS AGAINST NAM'S BREAKUP
SUPPORT CONTINUES

623
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:20,955
Oh my God!
Public opinion shifted completely!

624
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,210
But why isn't he calling?

625
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:29,505
He couldn't have lost
interest in you, right?

626
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:31,048
It hasn't even been a month.

627
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:35,344
Why aren't you calling him?

628
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:37,263
What do you mean?

629
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:41,642
It's not like you to wait for him to call.
Take the lead.

630
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:43,727
Like a real woman.

631
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:57,157
Yeah.

632
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,661
Oh, it's me.

633
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:02,788
Yeah.

634
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:04,290
Well.…

635
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:06,500
So…

636
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:09,169
Did you watch that thing?

637
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:11,380
Yeah.

638
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:13,799
Oh, so you did.

639
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:17,261
Are you doing okay?

640
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:19,722
Well, you know.

641
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:21,473
That means we're over.

642
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:24,393
I was the one who wanted to end it,

643
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:27,646
but I'm the one who can't let go.

644
00:43:28,314 --> 00:43:29,398
Where are you now?

645
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:30,316
Me?

646
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:32,359
I'm home.

647
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:33,777
Come outside for a second.

648
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:50,210
How long have you been out here?

649
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:53,047
Why did you call me?

650
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:56,133
Change of heart?

651
00:43:58,135 --> 00:43:59,887
My heart's never changed.

652
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:02,056
The circumstances did.

653
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:05,517
The circumstances changed?

654
00:44:06,143 --> 00:44:09,396
Circumstances can always change in life.

655
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:13,275
So?

656
00:44:13,942 --> 00:44:14,943
So, what?

657
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:22,993
So even though
the circumstances changed again…

658
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:26,830
we're still done for, right?

659
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:27,748
What?

660
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:30,542
You wanted a great farewell.

661
00:44:31,877 --> 00:44:33,462
Are you being clingy right now?

662
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,007
Is that why you called me?

663
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:39,885
Then why did you come here?

664
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:44,932
If you want to tell me that it's over,
why come all the way here…

665
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:49,853
Are you crying?

666
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:52,189
I'm not. Who's crying?

667
00:44:52,272 --> 00:44:53,982
Do you want to get back together?

668
00:44:54,066 --> 00:44:54,983
No!

669
00:44:56,735 --> 00:44:58,821
Wow, this is more than I expected.

670
00:44:58,904 --> 00:45:00,989
You don't look cool at all.

671
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:02,157
What are you saying?

672
00:45:03,575 --> 00:45:04,410
You're cute.

673
00:45:07,788 --> 00:45:12,042
You had me beg for your love
and then broke up with me twice.

674
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:16,088
So, I deserve to land
a punch on you, don't I?

675
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:18,549
What?

676
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:21,135
I missed you.

677
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,975
I missed you so much.

678
00:45:35,357 --> 00:45:36,191
Ow!

679
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:40,237
Ouch. Why did you hit me?
You don't have the right!

680
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,822
You think this is funny?

681
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:45,075
Do you know how hard it's been for me?

682
00:45:50,581 --> 00:45:52,249
Do you think it wasn't hard for me?

683
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:55,294
I thought I was dying.

684
00:45:56,628 --> 00:45:58,797
Jeez, the great Yeo Mi-ran is crying.

685
00:45:59,381 --> 00:46:01,175
Am I the first guy to make you cry?

686
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:03,010
I hate you!

687
00:46:06,472 --> 00:46:09,725
If you say you want to break up again,
I won't let you off lightly.

688
00:46:09,808 --> 00:46:11,018
I'll never say that.

689
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,229
I'm never saying that again!

690
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:18,108
Oh God.

691
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:19,276
I missed you.

692
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:20,652
You too.

693
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:25,199
-You were so mean!
-Ouch!

694
00:46:26,074 --> 00:46:28,660
That's enough, ouch.
It's going to leave a bruise.

695
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:34,875
The plaintiff Choi Soo-jin has the right
to 50% of the property

696
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:37,336
gained during the marriage.

697
00:46:37,419 --> 00:46:39,922
The plaintiff's claim
that the defendant Park Jae-hyeong

698
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:42,508
disgraced her by false claims
of infidelity is upheld.

699
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:45,177
The act of defamation
and the spreading of false rumors…

700
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:46,261
How are you feeling?

701
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:47,930
How was it in the courtroom?

702
00:46:48,013 --> 00:46:50,057
The infidelity claim is cleared.
How do you feel?

703
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:53,143
It wasn't a partial win but a total win.
A comment, please.

704
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:56,271
When I said I was innocent,
you didn't hear me. And now what?

705
00:46:58,273 --> 00:46:59,483
By the way,

706
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:01,235
one, two, three, four, five, six.

707
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:02,736
Just the six of you?

708
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:07,866
When it was about me having an affair,
dozens of you were following me.

709
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:12,162
My alleged affair gets over 200 articles,
but my court victory only gets six?

710
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:15,958
Oh dear.
Well, at least you guys are half-decent.

711
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:17,584
Thank you.

712
00:47:17,668 --> 00:47:21,213
Well, I feel so relieved
to have my name cleared.

713
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:24,049
If you want any other trifling details,

714
00:47:24,132 --> 00:47:27,052
I'll tell you everything, so call me.

715
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:29,388
That'll be all for today.

716
00:47:30,556 --> 00:47:32,558
Excuse me. You're Ms. Yeo Mi-ran, right?

717
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:34,393
Do you have plans for marriage?

718
00:47:34,476 --> 00:47:35,644
No, I do not.

719
00:47:38,689 --> 00:47:41,400
-Please look over here!
-Over here, please!

720
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:48,991
-It was good.
-Thank you.

721
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:52,369
-Hey, what are you doing?
-Wait.

722
00:47:53,328 --> 00:47:55,497
Oh, you've met plenty of celebrities.

723
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:57,875
Oh Se-na isn't just a celebrity.

724
00:47:57,958 --> 00:48:00,544
Wow, she really is on another level
compared to Ria.

725
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:02,254
I'm more nervous
than when I met Choi Soo-jin.

726
00:48:02,337 --> 00:48:03,839
Let go! Follow me!

727
00:48:03,922 --> 00:48:04,882
Hey, wait!

728
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:07,134
-Se-na.
-You came.

729
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:10,762
These are my fellow attorneys from work,
and they wanted to say hi to you.

730
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:11,763
Oh!

731
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:13,265
Hello!

732
00:48:13,348 --> 00:48:14,266
Hello.

733
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:17,686
I merely followed the light.
You're so beautiful.

734
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:19,187
Mi-ran!

735
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:21,690
Oh, hi!

736
00:48:21,773 --> 00:48:24,109
Sir, it's ready. Please go in.

737
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:25,277
Let's all go inside.

738
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:30,532
You look familiar.

739
00:48:32,951 --> 00:48:35,787
You're him, right? Mi-ran's ex.

740
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:37,456
Oh, yes.

741
00:48:37,539 --> 00:48:39,333
Wow, you certainly have a sharp memory.

742
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:42,002
So, you also work together with her?

743
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:43,921
Yes, we work at the same firm.

744
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:46,298
I guess you can break up
and still be friends.

745
00:48:46,381 --> 00:48:49,259
Oh, it wasn't a good breakup.
He cheated on her.

746
00:48:52,638 --> 00:48:55,057
It was you who cheated on her?

747
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:58,352
Oh God. That's interesting.

748
00:49:03,190 --> 00:49:04,191
Why isn't he here?

749
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:05,442
I don't know.

750
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:07,903
He's ignoring my calls and texts.

751
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:16,536
Wow, sir!

752
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,622
You did a great job. I'll enjoy the movie.

753
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:25,545
Good job. I'll enjoy the movie.

754
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:33,387
Did you have a fight with Kang-ho?

755
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:35,597
We don't even talk. Why would we fight?

756
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:38,100
You're the one who's not talking.

757
00:49:42,437 --> 00:49:43,939
Is the script almost finished?

758
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:45,440
Yeah. Well, almost.

759
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:48,068
What script?

760
00:49:49,027 --> 00:49:50,445
Won-jun's producing a movie.

761
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:51,655
A movie?

762
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:55,409
You didn't know? He's making a film noir.

763
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,289
Why didn't you tell me?

764
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:05,210
You were going to quit acting
like it's nothing. Why would I bother?

765
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:08,797
When did I say I was going to quit?
I said I wouldn't break up with Mi-ran.

766
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:14,136
Who's the male lead?

767
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:15,846
Not you.

768
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:17,514
Are you going to be like this?

769
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:23,061
Switch seats with me.

770
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:24,521
No, it's okay. Stay.

771
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:27,566
God, seriously.
You don't deserve to be called a friend.

772
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:29,276
You don't deserve it.

773
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:46,710
It's been a while.

774
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:49,796
Yes.

775
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,883
So, we meet again in this life, huh?

776
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:16,239
That's me there!

777
00:51:19,117 --> 00:51:20,869
-Is your back okay?
-Cut it out!

778
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:24,081
That you aren't the killer!

779
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:28,502
Let's talk after the movie.

780
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:34,174
Don't go anywhere. Wait for me.

781
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:35,342
Okay.

782
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:38,178
I got it, so please be quiet.

783
00:51:38,678 --> 00:51:40,430
It's like killing a bug.

784
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:45,936
"I'm not dead."

785
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:49,231
I'm not dead.

786
00:51:50,315 --> 00:51:51,733
I think I'll survive.

787
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:53,902
-I know everything.
-Whatever!

788
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:02,744
It's so sad.

789
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:29,604
Good job.

790
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:32,107
Did you like it? Good.

791
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:33,525
Thank you. Yes.

792
00:52:33,608 --> 00:52:35,318
What did Mr. Do say earlier?

793
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:38,572
Nothing, really. He just said hi.

794
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:39,990
Still scared of handsome men?

795
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:42,450
What are you so scared of?

796
00:52:43,034 --> 00:52:43,869
Hey.

797
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:46,413
You were just unlucky,

798
00:52:46,496 --> 00:52:48,331
but handsome guys are the nice ones.

799
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:54,629
Whoa! Stop!

800
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:57,215
-Oh my.
-Isn't that Mr. Do?

801
00:52:57,757 --> 00:52:58,592
Oh my God.

802
00:53:01,386 --> 00:53:02,971
What, is he Richard Gere?

803
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:06,766
-Wow, Mr. Do!
-He's so cool.

804
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:09,644
Is he insane?

805
00:53:11,813 --> 00:53:14,566
Oh my! I better step away!

806
00:53:15,692 --> 00:53:16,526
Hey, what's this?

807
00:53:24,075 --> 00:53:27,120
I never imagined
that I'd be doing something this cringy…

808
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:31,124
ever in my life.

809
00:53:32,792 --> 00:53:33,710
Shin Na-eun.

810
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:37,339
I like you very much.

811
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:46,139
Na-eun.

812
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:49,935
Please go out with me.

813
00:53:58,777 --> 00:54:00,528
What are you doing? Get up already!

814
00:54:00,612 --> 00:54:01,696
Go out with him!

815
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:03,865
Everyone's saying we should go out.

816
00:54:03,949 --> 00:54:06,701
And I'm on my knees,
so how can I just get up?

817
00:54:06,785 --> 00:54:08,495
Hurry up and take it!

818
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:10,038
Oh God!

819
00:54:10,121 --> 00:54:13,083
What he hates the most in this world
is getting embarrassed.

820
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:17,045
Well, I know someone
who publicly proposed and got turned down.

821
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:21,633
I mean, you could have just asked me out.

822
00:54:31,184 --> 00:54:32,018
Na-eun.

823
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:34,521
So are we now…

824
00:54:36,815 --> 00:54:37,732
officially dating?

825
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:42,070
I took the flowers.

826
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:57,877
-You're so handsome!
-Oh, thank you.

827
00:54:57,961 --> 00:54:58,962
You're handsome.

828
00:54:59,045 --> 00:54:59,879
Thank you.

829
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:01,756
-Be happy together!
-I'm a fan.

830
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:02,674
Thank you.

831
00:55:02,757 --> 00:55:04,509
Ask Na-eun

832
00:55:05,343 --> 00:55:08,430
to try and get him to pick me
for the male lead.

833
00:55:08,513 --> 00:55:11,516
Even if I don't actually do that,
he will come around soon.

834
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:14,602
When you're in love,
you become more generous.

835
00:55:15,103 --> 00:55:15,937
Right?

836
00:55:16,980 --> 00:55:19,149
So, when are we getting married?

837
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:21,568
What are you on about?

838
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:25,697
Well, the breakup was canceled,
and the marriage proposal still stands.

839
00:55:26,323 --> 00:55:28,992
What? I said I don't plan
on getting married.

840
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:32,704
What's wrong?

841
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:36,291
So, you won't marry me?

842
00:55:36,374 --> 00:55:38,752
That's not it. I just don't like marriage.

843
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:41,046
I don't like the Korean marriage culture.

844
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:43,506
"Korean marriage culture"?

845
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:46,217
Then we can live differently.

846
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,553
I want to have about two kids.

847
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:50,555
I'm not getting married.

848
00:55:50,638 --> 00:55:52,390
Oh, just give it a thought!

849
00:55:52,974 --> 00:55:54,225
You never listen to me.

850
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:55,310
I love you.

851
00:55:55,393 --> 00:55:57,729
Another battle has begun.

852
00:55:57,812 --> 00:56:00,565
A battle to tame and not to be tamed.

853
00:56:01,649 --> 00:56:02,901
Oh, yeah.

854
00:56:02,984 --> 00:56:06,154
Won-jun wants
to meet my parents this weekend.

855
00:56:06,738 --> 00:56:07,781
-Really?
-Yeah.

856
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:11,242
Mom saw a picture of him and freaked out
because he was so handsome.

857
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:12,452
Oh my God!

858
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:14,120
She also likes handsome guys!

859
00:56:15,997 --> 00:56:17,165
Oh, I can't wait!

860
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:22,379
Oh my God!

861
00:56:25,048 --> 00:56:27,008
-Excuse me. Mister?
-Huh?

862
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:28,760
Please apologize.

863
00:56:28,843 --> 00:56:29,761
For what?

864
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:31,763
Oh.

865
00:56:31,846 --> 00:56:34,849
Oh, it was just a compliment
because she's pretty!

866
00:56:34,933 --> 00:56:36,518
Oh, you're pretty too!

867
00:56:36,601 --> 00:56:39,646
Oh! You're quite pretty yourself!

868
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:41,773
Pretty!

869
00:56:41,856 --> 00:56:42,816
So pretty!

870
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:44,984
You little punk! How old are you?

871
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:46,069
What's going on?

872
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:48,071
What's wrong?

873
00:56:48,154 --> 00:56:49,823
What's happening here? Huh?

874
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:52,742
Well, this man came up to me

875
00:56:53,743 --> 00:56:54,911
and did this.

876
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:55,829
What?

877
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:58,873
Hey, man. How dare you!

878
00:56:58,957 --> 00:57:00,166
Oh, I'm sorry.

879
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:02,335
-Damn it. Let's go.
-I'm sorry about that.

880
00:57:02,419 --> 00:57:04,003
You better apologize properly!

881
00:57:05,046 --> 00:57:07,132
Apologize to the lady!

882
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:08,633
-It's okay.
-Oh!

883
00:57:08,716 --> 00:57:11,761
That's right. Women are easy prey,
and men are scary.

884
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:15,348
Let it go. They won't look down
on women like that again.

885
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:17,809
Honey, give me a second.

886
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:20,603
Hey!

887
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:21,521
Honey!

888
00:57:21,604 --> 00:57:24,274
-Stop! Stop right there!
-Honey! Stop!

889
00:57:24,858 --> 00:57:25,692
Honey!

890
00:57:26,943 --> 00:57:27,944
You bastard!

891
00:57:28,027 --> 00:57:31,114
You're dead when I catch you!

892
00:57:31,197 --> 00:57:34,367
-I'll apologize on their behalf.
-Apologize properly!

893
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:36,286
-Why are you so fast?
-Hey, you!

894
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:41,249
LOVE TO HATE YOU
