1
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,523
LOVE TO HATE YOU

2
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:32,198
If we deny the romance rumor,
it'll look like Kang-ho forced the kiss.

3
00:00:32,282 --> 00:00:34,367
And it would also make you appear

4
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:38,371
as though you allowed him to get away

5
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:41,249
with a somewhat aggressive
show of affection.

6
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:44,502
Instead of making it seem like
an impulsive act between mature adults,

7
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:47,338
it'd be better to say
you've been dating for a while.

8
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:49,382
What do you think?

9
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:52,052
A pretend relationship
for only three months.

10
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:58,725
Of course I'm not asking you
to do this for free.

11
00:00:59,434 --> 00:01:02,937
If you agree to this plan,
I will compensate you handsomely.

12
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,648
Did Mr. Nam Kang-ho

13
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:07,650
also agree to this?

14
00:01:07,734 --> 00:01:09,736
I never act against his wishes.

15
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,824
A man who fulfills his desires
under the guise of fan service.

16
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:19,079
A man who sexually harasses a woman
and then calls it romance.

17
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:22,665
A man who subjugates even anti-fans
with money and uses them.

18
00:01:37,388 --> 00:01:39,224
NAM KANG-HO HAS A SECRET GIRLFRIEND!

19
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:40,558
NAM ADMITS DATING?

20
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:42,560
WHO IS IT IN THE PHOTO? A CELEBRITY?

21
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:43,937
NAM'S GIRLFRIEND, NOT A CELEBRITY

22
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,980
NAM, NOT A FAN OF DATING CELEBRITIES
DOWON SAYS "LOOKING INTO IT"

23
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,941
What happened?
You couldn't kill the story?

24
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:49,150
No, let's meet first.

25
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,611
-Did you let this happen?
-Let's talk in person.

26
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:53,488
Since when do you side with reporters?

27
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:08,044
What's that?

28
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:12,757
What?

29
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:23,393
-Was that a woman?
-Maybe an athlete?

30
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:31,276
What?

31
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:36,531
What's up? Using up your free data?

32
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,367
NAM KANG-HO HAS A SECRET GIRLFRIEND!

33
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,618
That's you, isn't it?

34
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:48,501
-Are you dating Nam Kang-ho?
-Yeah!

35
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:52,839
Oh, so you are dating a man
who you think is a jerk?

36
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:55,216
-I know, right?
-Oh.

37
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,386
Nam Kang-ho is dating a woman
who called him a jerk to his face?

38
00:02:58,469 --> 00:02:59,470
I know, right?

39
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:00,597
DATING AGREEMENT CONTRACT

40
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,931
Then what's this?

41
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:11,733
We faxed to avoid possible email hacks,
and that got me caught.

42
00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:15,653
A three-month relationship
with Nam Kang-ho will be compensated

43
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,113
with 100 million won.

44
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,490
The contract must remain
confidential indefinitely.

45
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:22,702
Additional compensation will be given
in cases of defamation,

46
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:25,622
such as negative comments, doxing,
and blame for a breakup.

47
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:27,207
That woman…

48
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,960
Did she pawn herself out for 100 million?

49
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,086
What?

50
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,715
How can you talk so harshly about it?

51
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:38,343
How can you talk so harshly about it?

52
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:41,512
You're getting paid to date.
How is that not being a sugar baby?

53
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:42,722
But who do you think is worse?

54
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:47,268
The one receiving the money
or the one paying the money?

55
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,186
Huh?

56
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:53,107
If this leaks,
would it be more damaging to a top star

57
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:55,193
or a lowly lawyer?

58
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:56,194
Well, that's--

59
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:59,906
Therefore, since they want me
to be his lover and not his employee,

60
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:02,283
I'm going to try dating him
with confidence.

61
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:04,619
You're gonna actually date him?

62
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:06,120
Kang-ho.

63
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:09,249
It may have started as a contract,
but turn it into a real thing.

64
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:13,586
Hey, forget everything I said so far,
and just follow your heart.

65
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:16,256
Your body is telling you
what's in your heart.

66
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,175
Isn't this the first time
you've felt like this since Se-na?

67
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,011
You may never find another girl like this.

68
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:24,347
Kang-ho, hold on to Yeo Mi-ran.

69
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:29,018
"A love scandal becomes a relationship."
Isn't that rather romantic?

70
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,019
That's true.

71
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:34,399
I might as well turn it into a romance.

72
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:36,067
But the more romantic it gets,

73
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,279
the bigger the heartbreak.

74
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,325
EPISODE 6
FEMME FATALE VS HOMME FATALE

75
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:48,037
It's only a matter of time
before you're doxed

76
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,957
and become a laughingstock
and fodder for gossip!

77
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,834
You can't live like this!

78
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:57,088
You won't be able to walk the streets
or have casual flings like before.

79
00:04:57,171 --> 00:05:00,133
Is 100 million won really enough
for your privacy and freedom?

80
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:02,719
You're right.

81
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:06,889
I should have asked for 200 million won.

82
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,725
If we met halfway at 150 million won,

83
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,602
I could've made another 50 million, darn!

84
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:14,522
Wow, when did you become so desperate?

85
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:17,442
"Desperate"? It's called hustling!

86
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:19,235
Make as much as you can when you can.

87
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:25,992
Is that Nam Kang-ho?

88
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:27,076
NAM KANG-HO

89
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,579
-Is it?
-Yes, hello?

90
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:30,496
Don't do it.

91
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,374
Shouldn't we meet up
before making this public?

92
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,168
Of course we should.

93
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:36,502
No, don't do it.

94
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,838
Hey!

95
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,592
Oh, don't do it!

96
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:46,179
If you don't have actual feelings
for Nam Kang-ho, don't do it!

97
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:48,973
I'm going to blow this wide open, okay?

98
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:51,017
This is confiscated. You can't have it!

99
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,246
The contract can be reprinted.

100
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:16,042
What's that? Your dress-to-kill outfit?

101
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,461
How about it? Do I look promising?

102
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:19,879
Yeah.

103
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:41,734
Do you think we are being watched
at this moment?

104
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,111
Maybe?

105
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:45,196
Then we have to do something.

106
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:02,880
Seat belt.

107
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:07,760
Seat belt.

108
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:20,398
NAM KANG-HO - MOVIE/TV ACTOR
AGENCY: DOWON ENTERTAINMENT

109
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,445
AGENCY: DOWON ENTERTAINMENT

110
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:38,916
Thank you for helping out.

111
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,501
Well, I'm not doing it for free.

112
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,962
It's a massively high-paying
part-time job.

113
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:47,508
We might as well continue
the fight training too.

114
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,052
Sure, let's do that.

115
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,514
You're gorgeous.

116
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:59,770
By the way, where are we going?

117
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:28,508
How can I help you?

118
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:32,011
Oh, I'd like a word with the CEO.

119
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:33,471
What is this regarding?

120
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:36,015
Could you tell him
that I'm a friend of Yeo Mi-ran?

121
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:38,434
That I'm like a family member to Mi-ran.

122
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,977
Please wait just a moment.

123
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:51,822
He's a work of art!

124
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:01,415
Hello, sir.

125
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:04,669
Who's that?

126
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:12,510
An actor?

127
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:14,637
A model?

128
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:20,685
Did you ask for me?

129
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:23,604
Oh, I'm a friend of the attorney,
Yeo Mi-ran.

130
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,815
Yes. Ms. Yeo Mi-ran.

131
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:31,821
I would like to speak
with the CEO here, not an actor.

132
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:35,116
Yes. I'm Do Won-jun, the CEO.

133
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:37,201
I'd like to talk to the CE--

134
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:39,203
So, what brings you here?

135
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:41,539
-You're the CEO here?
-Yes.

136
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:45,126
Why is a CEO so handsome?

137
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:47,461
So the reason you wanted to see me is…

138
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,047
Oh! Oh, right!

139
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:52,216
Listen. Just what do you think

140
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,427
you are doing to my friend?

141
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:01,934
Let's go talk somewhere more private.

142
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:03,728
Like where?

143
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:12,278
Where are we?

144
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,698
Some call it a vacation house.

145
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:17,199
Please come in.

146
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:21,829
Is he showing off his wealth?

147
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:31,130
These are real.

148
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:33,758
-When did you prepare this?
-Today.

149
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:45,061
Today is our first day together.

150
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:46,062
Have a seat.

151
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,920
Have you not told Mr. Do about it?

152
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,171
Told him what?

153
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,590
That I'm not actually your fan.

154
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,467
That you're not a fan but an anti-fan?

155
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,178
I didn't tell him.

156
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:22,181
Guys don't share every little detail,
even if they're close.

157
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,101
Are you saying that girls do?

158
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:30,106
-They don't?
-Anyway, I'm not an anti-fan.

159
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,233
I've never posted a negative comment.

160
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:35,736
That's good to know
that you don't hate me that much.

161
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,738
We'll have to hold hands
from time to time.

162
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:40,950
Oh.

163
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:44,662
We may have to hold hands depending
on the circumstances. Would that be okay?

164
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:50,835
That's not a big deal.
We've already done much more than that.

165
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,253
Oh.

166
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,380
Yes. You're right.

167
00:11:56,006 --> 00:11:57,842
Thank you for such a fancy meal.

168
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:58,884
I'm so lucky today.

169
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,808
He's putting in this much effort for me.

170
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,560
Maybe it wasn't just fan service?

171
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:12,565
She says she's not an anti-fan now.
My charm must be starting to work.

172
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,402
CEO DO WON-JUN

173
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:24,660
How did you come across that contract?

174
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:28,789
We're roommates.

175
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:32,543
-And I just happened to see the fax first.
-I see.

176
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:35,880
Mi-ran is a free-spirited person.

177
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:39,592
She can't expose her life and give away
her freedom for a measly 100 million won.

178
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,177
A measly 100 million?

179
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:44,722
It says the contract will be void
if confidentiality isn't maintained.

180
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:48,225
Now that I know of it, is it void?
Wait, no.

181
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:52,354
She hasn't even signed it yet,
so we can pretend this never happened.

182
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:59,111
Excuse me,
how much more money would you like?

183
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:01,113
Sorry?

184
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,783
I'm uncomfortable telling you
my personal matters as we've just met,

185
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:07,995
but I had to cash out my insurance policy
and my savings plan.

186
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:11,832
It's a bear market these days,
but I withdrew all of my crypto too.

187
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:15,211
You are paying that 100 million won
and not Mr. Nam Kang-ho?

188
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,879
Well, you read the contract.

189
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,090
This contract is between me and Ms. Yeo.

190
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:21,383
A: DO WON-JUN
B: YEO MI-RAN

191
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:26,305
It's so I can take full responsibility
in case anything goes wrong.

192
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:29,225
I have to protect Kang-ho.

193
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,313
Well, anyway,
if I scrounge up everything else I have,

194
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:38,442
I might have maybe
another 20 or 30 million won?

195
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:42,321
I think I'd be able to prepare
that much more somehow--

196
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:43,781
Excuse me!

197
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:46,367
What are you talking about?

198
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:48,828
I'm sorry?

199
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:51,539
Do you think
I'm asking you for more money?

200
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:53,541
I don't need that kind of money.

201
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:56,293
I'm telling you not to talk my friend
into something like this.

202
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,254
Money isn't everything. How dare you!

203
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:04,343
I'm not going to idly stand by
as my friend gets roped into this lie!

204
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:06,428
Oh, sure.

205
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:07,888
Oh, yes.

206
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:12,476
I'm sorry. I think I misunderstood you.

207
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,231
You know what?

208
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:20,693
I hope things actually work out

209
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:23,946
between Kang-ho and Ms. Yeo.

210
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:27,908
My buddy Kang-ho has been lonely
for such a long time, and…

211
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:31,120
Well, anyway.

212
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:35,291
Once I got to know Ms. Yeo a little bit,

213
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,627
she seemed to be a good person.

214
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:41,380
And she also has

215
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,216
a good friend like you.

216
00:14:50,306 --> 00:14:51,932
Parents, older brother, and niece.

217
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:54,101
I don't get along with my mother.

218
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:56,145
Parents, older brother, and his wife.

219
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:57,521
I don't get along with Dad.

220
00:14:57,605 --> 00:14:59,398
"Kang" means strong. "Ho" means hero.

221
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,191
In short, a tough guy.

222
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,611
"Mi," beautiful. "Ran," orchid.
I can't stand it.

223
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,280
I plan on changing it,
but I haven't picked a name I like.

224
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:08,407
-Where did we first meet?
-Let's say a resort.

225
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,491
That's actually true.

226
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,869
Our first kiss? Same day as the photo.

227
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:13,245
That's also true.

228
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,332
What do we call each other?

229
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,750
Oh, terms of endearment?

230
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,419
In the contract,
I noticed that I'm three years older.

231
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,173
"Oppa"? And I call you "Baby"?

232
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,635
Is that what you're into?

233
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,553
No, I'm not particularly into anything.

234
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,933
Then how about
we both call each other "Honey"?

235
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:35,935
Honey.

236
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:38,896
Honey!

237
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:40,898
You don't like it?

238
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:42,650
Let's do that.

239
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:45,235
And how about we take a selfie together?

240
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:48,572
I feel like we should have
at least one photo of us together.

241
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,991
Good idea. Let's take one.

242
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:00,960
Should I take it? My arm is longer.

243
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:03,754
-Go ahead.
-Okay.

244
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:09,551
Okay, here we go.

245
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,637
One, two…

246
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,224
Jeez.

247
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:17,393
I closed my eyes.

248
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:21,105
It came out a little weird.
Let me take another one.

249
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:23,148
One, two…

250
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,903
Why do you keep moving at "three"?
You're shaking the camera.

251
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:29,571
I did?

252
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:30,489
-Yes.
-Let me see.

253
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:32,241
Let's just take it again.

254
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:38,080
What was that?
You didn't even do a countdown!

255
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,915
You look cute in the picture.

256
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,252
Aw, what is that?

257
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:47,881
I can't help but notice
you are really pretty.

258
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:54,805
The best way to disarm a woman
is to compliment her looks.

259
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,474
"Cute" and "pretty."

260
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,810
They sound like compliments,

261
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:03,480
but complimenting one's looks means
you're looking down on the person.

262
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:06,400
We've exchanged information
and agreed upon certain things.

263
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:09,778
I think the next course of action
is to let people see us.

264
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:12,364
To add truth to the rumor.

265
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,200
Let people see us?

266
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:18,078
You mean hang out in public?

267
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,248
Anything you want to do?

268
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,252
I've ridden bikes at shoots.

269
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:05,459
You have your own?

270
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:08,921
I got it as a prize.
I won a championship, you know.

271
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:35,114
Just how much do you score?

272
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:36,198
I don't know.

273
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,867
Scores between 500 and 1,000
are pretty much the same.

274
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:39,952
A thousand?

275
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:45,457
I've got you under my spell now!

276
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:59,388
Wake her up, and tell her to go in.

277
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,306
Stop looking at her.

278
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,434
How does it feel to watch
a girl sleeping next to you?

279
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:08,522
It makes you imagine us in the same bed.
Exciting, right?

280
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:12,818
There you go!

281
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,487
We're here. Wake up!

282
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:20,284
You did well today.

283
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:21,994
Go get some rest.

284
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:26,540
Oh, yes. Thank you.

285
00:19:43,265 --> 00:19:44,349
What was that?

286
00:19:45,392 --> 00:19:46,727
Is he not under my spell yet?

287
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:52,900
Or is he mad that I fell asleep
while he was driving?

288
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:25,849
I'm the one seducing her! Me!

289
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,068
NAM ADMITS
HE HAS A NONCELEBRITY GIRLFRIEND

290
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,990
NAM CONFIRMS RELATIONSHIP
WHO IS HIS GIRLFRIEND?

291
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,786
But as Nam Kang-ho's girlfriend,
what I had to endure

292
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:47,663
was more than just my face in the news.

293
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:51,667
I'm sure it must have been tough for you
to settle into the company.

294
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,378
Was there anything you found troubling?

295
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:56,505
No. Not at all.

296
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:57,965
-Oh.
-Come on now!

297
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:01,468
Our dear Ms. Yeo has
such an understanding personality,

298
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:03,971
so she must get along well with everyone!

299
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:08,350
What's with this royal treatment?

300
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,686
Did I move up a social class?

301
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:14,940
Why would Nam Kang-ho go out with you?

302
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:16,525
Hang on a second.

303
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:19,569
That bastard isn't toying
with my daughter, is he?

304
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:22,030
I'm toying with him.

305
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,866
Jeez. Stop with such nonsense!

306
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:34,001
-You have to take this!
-Oh, hello?

307
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:35,585
My papers!

308
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:36,753
What's this?

309
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:38,755
Lawyer Yeo Mi-ran was fair game,

310
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:41,008
but Nam Kang-ho's girlfriend
is off-limits?

311
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:46,555
Or single women are fair game,
but those with boyfriends are off-limits?

312
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:47,556
Damn it!

313
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:49,308
Whichever it is, it sucks!

314
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:51,601
I bet even Cinderella
must have felt like crap

315
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:54,980
because all women envied her,
but no men envied the prince!

316
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:56,815
Anything else that bothers you?

317
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:58,734
Huh?

318
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:01,403
That CEO or whatever,

319
00:22:01,903 --> 00:22:04,990
he said he'd do his best to make sure
your privacy isn't disturbed

320
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:06,408
but be careful.

321
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:11,830
Mr. Do decided not to make an issue
about Na-eun being aware of the contract

322
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:15,292
because it'd be difficult to hide it
from a roommate,

323
00:22:15,792 --> 00:22:18,086
and he thought
Na-eun was a trustworthy friend.

324
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,005
NAM KANG-HO'S SECRET GIRLFRIEND

325
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:21,465
I should have stopped her.

326
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:28,347
Once I got to know Ms. Yeo a little bit,
she seemed to be a good person.

327
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:33,268
And she also has a good friend like you.

328
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,070
If Kang-ho falls,

329
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,198
I'll fall as well.

330
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:49,034
Please help.

331
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:51,536
I'm counting on you.

332
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:03,965
You should have stayed focused, you idiot!

333
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:13,433
Hello?

334
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:15,519
Is this Assistant Purser Shin Na-eun?

335
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,900
Oh, yes. This is she.

336
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:23,777
Who am I talking to?

337
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:24,820
This is Do Won-jun.

338
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:33,203
I was kind of out of it the other day,
but I'd like to treat you to a meal.

339
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:36,623
Oh, but I'm headed for a flight right now.

340
00:23:36,706 --> 00:23:38,750
Oh, is that right?

341
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:39,835
Yes.

342
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:42,462
When will you be back?

343
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:43,713
Oh, tomorrow.

344
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:47,134
The director keeps saying
that he feels bad about what happened.

345
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:51,138
And he really likes your acting,
but because of the investors and media…

346
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:53,306
Yes. I understand.

347
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:57,769
He's also very sorry
you have to start shooting right away

348
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,521
because of the delay in schedule.

349
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:02,732
Did the director actually
say those things himself?

350
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:06,111
It's just that I've never seen him talk.

351
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:09,531
Oh, it's all in his body language.

352
00:24:09,614 --> 00:24:12,868
Everyone who's worked with him
understands his thoughts.

353
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:14,453
But how?

354
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,206
Oh, there he comes.

355
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,126
Oh, hello.

356
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:30,093
I'm sorry to cause you trouble.

357
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:41,897
He's really dating someone, right?

358
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,524
You're not fooling me, are you?

359
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,820
I'm just wondering
how you didn't know about it.

360
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,072
It must have been rough on you.

361
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:54,659
I know, right?

362
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:58,038
He's really prudent to a fault, you know?

363
00:24:58,121 --> 00:25:00,707
He didn't even tell me about it.

364
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:01,833
I heard she's a lawyer.

365
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:05,003
-What is she like?
-She seems like a decent person.

366
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,006
Her roommate seemed nice too.

367
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:10,926
You met her friend?

368
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:13,303
Huh? Yeah.

369
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:16,264
-And her friend seemed nice?
-Yeah.

370
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:20,852
Oh, what I mean is
she seemed like a nice person.

371
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:24,731
-What?
-Is she pretty?

372
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:27,567
-Huh? Who?
-Her friend.

373
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:30,612
Oh, her friend?

374
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:32,864
I don't know.

375
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:35,575
Is she pretty?

376
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:37,160
You said she seemed nice.

377
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:40,121
Yeah, sure!
She seemed like a nice person. She did.

378
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:41,206
Jeez.

379
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:51,841
-Thank you.
-Thank you so much.

380
00:25:51,925 --> 00:25:53,176
Oh, here.

381
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,220
Your name?

382
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:57,556
I'm Kim Min-seok.

383
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:59,432
Dear Min-seok.

384
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,812
-Thank you.
-Yes, thank you.

385
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,313
I'm Jang U-seong.

386
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:06,731
Jang U-seong.

387
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:08,900
-Thank you.
-Sure.

388
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:10,068
You're really pretty.

389
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:12,112
-Thanks. Let's have a great time!
-Yes!

390
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:17,409
-I'm Kim Jeong-kwon.
-Dear Kim Jeong-kwon.

391
00:26:17,492 --> 00:26:19,077
I've been your fan since I was nine.

392
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:20,412
No way.

393
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:23,164
It's true.
I was at your first fan signing event

394
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:25,166
at a department store in Seoul.

395
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,252
The kid who wouldn't let go of my hand?

396
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:28,878
Do you remember that?

397
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:31,214
Yeah, I do! Good to see you again!

398
00:26:34,551 --> 00:26:37,220
-Now you're working with her?
-That's a dream come true!

399
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:39,055
I've been a fan since I was 30.

400
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:40,724
Thank you.

401
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:55,447
Kang-ho!

402
00:26:57,824 --> 00:26:58,867
How do I look?

403
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:02,996
Your stylist did a good job.

404
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:04,873
Yeah? Do I look pretty?

405
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:06,583
You look nice too.

406
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:13,173
Sorry about the other day.

407
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:16,509
-I was harsh to you.
-What?

408
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:20,263
Oh. Saying that I was being gross?

409
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:23,183
It's okay.

410
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:24,934
I caused all of that.

411
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:29,189
You used to be a person who couldn't say
such things, but because of me…

412
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:32,901
I'm the one who's sorry.
I'll be good from now on.

413
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:37,405
That's why I'm planning
to turn you back into that bright Kang-ho

414
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,616
who used to laugh so much.

415
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:43,203
Why is she acting all cute?

416
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:45,955
I think you should just focus
on your acting, Ms. Oh.

417
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:49,959
I'm bright when I'm with my girlfriend,
and I laugh a lot too.

418
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:53,546
You don't have to pretend
when you're with me.

419
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:57,801
You don't think I would tell anyone
that your girlfriend is a fake, do you?

420
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,011
Who says she's fake?

421
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:02,222
I mean,

422
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:04,265
no one knows that.

423
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:05,809
It's just a hunch.

424
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:08,853
Won-jun's really good.

425
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,022
He found someone else right away.

426
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:13,358
Hey, you're wrong.

427
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:15,110
Either way, well done

428
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:18,154
because I really wanted to do
this movie with you.

429
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:45,807
I'm sure you all know
without me having to say this out loud,

430
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:52,939
but do not be running your mouths outside
about Yeo Mi-ran. Got it?

431
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,024
-Yes, sir.
-Okay.

432
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:56,901
If anyone asks…

433
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:03,324
she is decent, skilled,
and has a great personality.

434
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,034
That's all you say about her.

435
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:07,537
She drinks well, dances well,

436
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:10,290
knocks down a row of shots
from here to there with a kick,

437
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:12,333
and fights well. Nothing about that, okay?

438
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:14,878
-Fights well?
-She's good at fighting too?

439
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:16,629
Is she a black belt?

440
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,841
Ms. Yeo herself said
that she's a good fighter.

441
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:20,759
Ms. Yeo?

442
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:24,971
And Ms. Yeo, you should refrain
from partaking in things

443
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:27,348
such as a side gig, okay, ma'am?

444
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:30,143
-"Ma'am"?
-"Side gig"?

445
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:32,604
Oh, sounds like
you've never done it before.

446
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:33,938
That's good, then.

447
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:34,939
What is it?

448
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:36,649
Explain to her nicely.

449
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:39,194
Explain.

450
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:43,364
It's when you go to court
in place of an attorney…

451
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:45,825
Ma'am.

452
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:48,620
You just go there,
show your face, and say,

453
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:50,371
"Please expedite it,"

454
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:52,665
or "I'll defer my defense."

455
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:56,878
It's 100,000 won per case,
none of us can wait to try it.

456
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:58,296
What did you say?

457
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:02,634
I mean, it's not often
that we get such an opportunity.

458
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:06,262
I've only done it once so far, sir.
For real--

459
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:10,475
Ms. Yeo Mi-ran,

460
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:13,228
if you have anything you wish to say,
please go ahead.

461
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:17,106
Are there any requests or suggestions
about things we can improve in the office?

462
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:22,403
I find it uncomfortable
that you're speaking so politely to me.

463
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:24,906
So use that tone with everyone here

464
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:26,449
or speak casually to me.

465
00:31:51,492 --> 00:31:53,161
Hyeok-su, what are you doing?

466
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,122
You make me blush!

467
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,917
Come on, put me down!

468
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:02,003
-Put me down.
-Cut!

469
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:05,256
All right, it looks good. Okay!

470
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:08,259
Oh my, she's pregnant!

471
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:09,260
-Really?
-Se-na!

472
00:32:09,344 --> 00:32:10,470
Ouch! Damn it!

473
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:11,512
-Congrats!
-Kang-ho.

474
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:12,430
Yeah.

475
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:14,641
Hyun-sang!

476
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:17,226
Where do we find
a female stunt double out of the blue?

477
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,479
-Se-na's stunt double is pregnant.
-I'm sorry.

478
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:21,731
And the father is the stunt director.

479
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:22,649
What?

480
00:32:22,732 --> 00:32:25,109
Anyway, when did you start
seeing each other?

481
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:28,696
It hasn't been that long.

482
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,865
It hasn't been that long,
and she's pregnant?

483
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:32,533
Wow.

484
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,088
No, ma'am.

485
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:47,090
It's okay.

486
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:53,262
Looks like I'm destined to get
sucker punched throughout this year.

487
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:56,557
Come on, you don't mean that!

488
00:32:56,641 --> 00:33:00,186
My husband turns out to be
another woman's boyfriend,

489
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:05,566
and a lawyer I trusted like my sister
turns out to be Nam Kang-ho's girlfriend.

490
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:09,904
I'm sorry I didn't tell you sooner,
but I couldn't disclose it.

491
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:13,282
Of course, I know!

492
00:33:13,366 --> 00:33:15,326
I'm a celebrity myself, you know.

493
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,829
I know it's hard
to reveal our private affairs.

494
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:19,956
Unless it's to someone who you trust.

495
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:27,380
Hey, I don't know that much
about Nam Kang-ho,

496
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:29,799
but he must know quite a bit about me

497
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:32,343
because the two of you
must have talked about me.

498
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,971
"She wants us to be like sisters.
She bossed me around."

499
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:35,972
Not at all!

500
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:39,392
I happen to take pride
in my work ethic as a lawyer.

501
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:43,271
I never talk about my client's business
to anyone, no matter how trivial.

502
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:44,605
So don't worry.

503
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,858
Well, I'm relieved if that's the case.

504
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,902
But I still feel quite uncomfortable.

505
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,947
Maybe I have to switch my lawyer again?

506
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,575
Now they'll call me "Bossy Girl"
and not "Sudden Girl."

507
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:56,534
Soo-jin!

508
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:59,162
Is being Nam Kang-ho's girl
that big of a deal?

509
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:00,830
As a lawyer, I'm just a lackey,

510
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:02,999
but as his girl,
am I a queen or something?

511
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:04,542
Wow!

512
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:08,004
I never knew I'd snatch a Mr. Right
and turn my life around so well.

513
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:16,971
I feel better that you're
talking back to me. I feel less betrayed.

514
00:34:20,516 --> 00:34:21,476
Cheers.

515
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:28,775
So, you were dating him
when we had the office party, right?

516
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:34,405
-Right.
-Was it before you got hired at Gilmu?

517
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:37,492
-Yes.
-How did you two meet?

518
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:38,576
Was it arranged?

519
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:40,495
No! Uh…

520
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,622
By accident, at a resort.

521
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:48,628
We kind of bumped into each other,
and we started talking.

522
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,339
I fooled my own mom,

523
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,175
so why does fooling this lady
feel so difficult?

524
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:59,055
So you came to Gilmu to work
and spend time with your boyfriend

525
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:01,182
but ended up
with an outspoken lady like me?

526
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:05,103
No, I didn't come here to do all that.

527
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:06,604
I came to make money.

528
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:10,024
Out of the places I could work,
Gilmu offered the best salary.

529
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:12,902
Did you say "salary"?

530
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:15,446
Becoming Nam Kang-ho's wife
would pay you the most,

531
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:17,490
and you wouldn't have to work at all.

532
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:19,742
Excuse me.

533
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:22,245
I told you I've dated a lot of guys.

534
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:25,998
Boyfriends come and go.
Even husbands come and go, you know!

535
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:29,335
Oh, I'm so sorry!

536
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:34,215
Anyway, I can't stand getting
free meals and gifts from guys!

537
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:36,884
So I've never had to give things back
after breaking up.

538
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:39,137
Oh, but I had to get things back
from them.

539
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:44,892
Kang-ho never dated anyone before,
but he sure has an eye for a good woman!

540
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:50,398
Oh, hey!

541
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:53,359
You ruined my diet today!

542
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:56,404
I worked out even when I felt low
about my husband cheating on me.

543
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:59,490
Jeez, I can't let my diet
completely go to waste.

544
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:00,825
Let's go.

545
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:02,869
-Come with me.
-Where are we going?

546
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:07,748
-What's the best for sobering up?
-Pooping!

547
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:11,377
Really? Do you think
I'd ask you to go poop together?

548
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,379
I know, right?

549
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,464
That's so disgusting!

550
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,269
Hi, Honey.

551
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:32,648
Honey?

552
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:34,609
Oh, are you with someone?

553
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:35,526
Yeah.

554
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:36,861
I'm with Soo-jin.

555
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:37,862
Oh.

556
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:41,407
Then, since it's awkward
for only me to talk formally,

557
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:43,284
I'll speak casually.

558
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:47,205
What are you doing tomorrow? Are you busy?

559
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:48,998
-Tomorrow?
-Yeah.

560
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:51,667
I'm wondering
if you can come to the movie set.

561
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:52,752
Why?

562
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:54,253
We need a female stunt performer.

563
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:57,340
-Really?
-Yeah.

564
00:36:57,423 --> 00:36:58,591
Okay. Sure!

565
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:00,927
Look how happy she is.
Jeez, she's so excited.

566
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:03,512
What time? Where do I go?

567
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:04,847
I'll send you a text.

568
00:37:04,931 --> 00:37:06,182
Yeah, okay!

569
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:09,018
Oh my! Mi-ran is totally naked!

570
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,482
Not completely naked, just topless.

571
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:15,691
We're getting a massage.

572
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:21,948
A massage?
Sure, then you have to get naked!

573
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:24,283
Okay, talk to you later!

574
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,041
You moron!

575
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:34,794
"Then you have to get naked"?

576
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:37,546
What the hell am I even saying?

577
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:44,053
If you don't mind,
may I come and pick you up?

578
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:51,394
I'm waiting for you.

579
00:37:57,191 --> 00:37:58,442
Good work, everyone.

580
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,279
-You did well too, sir.
-You too.

581
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:04,240
Huh? Who is that guy?

582
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:06,450
Is he a model?

583
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:08,703
-Are they shooting here?
-Is it a movie shoot?

584
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,666
It's always been just a dream.

585
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:18,379
A man like that coming to see me
and waiting for me.

586
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:21,424
Being the envy of everyone.

587
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,221
I'll see you all later.

588
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:28,848
Okay, bye.

589
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:35,229
Allow me.

590
00:38:38,649 --> 00:38:39,984
You must be very tired.

591
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:41,110
Not at all.

592
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:43,863
You must be busy,
but you came all the way here.

593
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:45,281
I'm not that busy today.

594
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:48,367
-Let's go.
-Okay.

595
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:51,120
Stupid!

596
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:01,964
In a closed space with a man like this…

597
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:04,383
This is insane!

598
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:08,888
You wouldn't want to go into the city
and get some food with me, would you?

599
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:12,099
-You must want to get some rest.
-I'm fine.

600
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:14,268
You've come all this way.

601
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:19,565
Oh, but my clothes
would be a bit out of place.

602
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:21,275
You look great.

603
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:30,743
It looks like we'll hit some traffic,
so take a nap if you're tired.

604
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:32,661
I'll wake you up when we arrive.

605
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:34,246
Arrive where?

606
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:35,956
Your house.

607
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,458
Do you know where I live?

608
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:41,545
Oh, well, it's in the contract.
Ms. Yeo's home address.

609
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:42,880
You're her roommate.

610
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:47,551
Oh, you're quite meticulous, aren't you?

611
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:54,642
Are you keeping tabs on me
in case I talk to someone about Mi-ran?

612
00:39:55,976 --> 00:39:57,645
What, because I came to pick you up?

613
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:00,064
Not at all.

614
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,358
Wow!

615
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:05,528
It's just that I didn't properly
apologize the other day,

616
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:07,029
so I've been feeling bad.

617
00:40:08,155 --> 00:40:08,989
About what?

618
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:11,659
At first, I thought
you were asking for more money

619
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:13,786
and misunderstood you.

620
00:40:15,955 --> 00:40:19,375
The more I thought about it,
it made me feel bad that I misjudged you.

621
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,211
I mean, well,

622
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:25,506
there must be a lot of people like that.

623
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:28,634
Oh God, you have no idea.

624
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:32,304
They think an entertainment company
is as rich as a chaebol

625
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:33,639
and try to take a slice.

626
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:34,807
But the truth is

627
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:38,477
an entertainment company
is not as wealthy as it looks.

628
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:40,563
It's all show and no go.

629
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:43,858
Oh, is that so?

630
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,989
I didn't tell them you're my girlfriend.

631
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:51,824
It might make them uncomfortable.

632
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,787
Most female stunt workers are booked
on other shoots, so they're hard to find.

633
00:40:58,038 --> 00:41:00,458
The stunt director is well aware of that.

634
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:03,961
Excuse me.

635
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:07,214
Are we shooting scene number 38 today?

636
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:09,717
What scene is that?

637
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:17,224
Let's go!

638
00:41:58,265 --> 00:41:59,725
Yes, that was good!

639
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:07,149
If you feel even slightly overwhelmed,
you have to say "stop."

640
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:09,235
Don't wait for the word cut.
Just say "stop."

641
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:11,153
Sure. Of course!

642
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:12,863
Don't you worry.

643
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:14,698
She knows her stuff.

644
00:42:19,578 --> 00:42:21,080
What do I have to do?

645
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:25,251
There they are!

646
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:48,566
Boss!

647
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:52,069
Her lover Hyeok-su
has to go to jail for murder,

648
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:55,823
but it turns out
the actual murderer was his boss.

649
00:42:57,074 --> 00:43:00,786
So-jeong goes to the gangsters
to rescue her lover.

650
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:02,746
-What's this?
-Where is Hyeok-su?

651
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:04,748
-Tell me!
-You're at the wrong place!

652
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:06,959
But she can't meet the boss.

653
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:08,836
I know Hyeok-su is not the murderer!

654
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:11,839
Gangsters push her,
and she flies through the glass.

655
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:25,769
Hey, Ms. Yeo!

656
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:28,063
-Are you okay?
-Is she hurt?

657
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:30,399
Hey, call 911!

658
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:34,403
How did it go?

659
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:36,655
I tried hard not to show my face
when I rolled.

660
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:40,576
I did well, right?

661
00:43:43,537 --> 00:43:45,039
You startled me!

662
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:50,336
Are you in this business?

663
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:52,254
No, I'm just an office worker.

664
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:54,673
I see. So, you work out as a hobby?

665
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:57,259
Yes. I'm a huge fan of action movies.

666
00:43:57,343 --> 00:44:00,137
Wow, do I sense a hidden master here?

667
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:01,889
What kind of action in particular?

668
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:04,933
I like everything
that has Michelle Yeoh in it!

669
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:08,228
She can do hand-to-hand combat,
car chases, basically everything!

670
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:11,440
-You're a traditionalist!
-Yes, that was real stunt work!

671
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:15,110
We use wires these days,
but people just jumped back then!

672
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:16,737
-Right?
-Yes!

673
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:19,782
They did everything
without the machines and camera tricks!

674
00:44:19,865 --> 00:44:20,824
That's right!

675
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:23,327
Taekwon!

676
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:29,750
Try and hit me.

677
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:30,668
What?

678
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:33,462
I just want to see
how good the hidden master is.

679
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:34,588
Oh man!

680
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:38,008
-Where should I hit you?
-Anywhere!

681
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:50,771
Stop acting, seriously!

682
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:53,565
Hey, it really hurts! I'm serious!

683
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:56,568
-Wow, how are you so strong?
-Does it really hurt?

684
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:59,863
It's not about my strength. It's my speed!

685
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:03,909
-Don't laugh. Try it.
-I couldn't see her hand.

686
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:05,661
-Should I?
-Hey!

687
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:07,996
Here I come.

688
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:13,836
Damn it!

689
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:22,761
Sir, she's better than your girlfriend!

690
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:24,888
Who are you really?

691
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:27,266
You were a school bully, right?

692
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:33,897
I did beat up a lot of bullies!

693
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:36,150
Honey.

694
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:38,777
You can go home if you're done.

695
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:44,158
She's my girlfriend.

696
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:46,034
Please look out for her.

697
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:51,749
You didn't want them to know
because it might be uncomfortable.

698
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:53,500
I was wrong.

699
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:56,170
It'd make them more uncomfortable
if they found out later.

700
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:58,422
You should have told us sooner.

701
00:45:58,505 --> 00:46:01,925
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

702
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:03,135
I'm sorry.

703
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:05,888
I acted without discussing it with you.

704
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:10,350
I don't mind.
They would have found out eventually.

705
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:17,107
I did beat up a lot of bullies!

706
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:18,108
Honey.

707
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:21,361
I guess that bothered him.

708
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:24,740
You've definitely fallen under my spell!

709
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,575
I think they're fighting.

710
00:46:26,658 --> 00:46:29,495
I wonder what it feels like
to fight such a handsome man.

711
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:36,919
Seems the news spread already.

712
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:43,258
Should we show them

713
00:46:44,301 --> 00:46:45,803
how we say goodbye?

714
00:46:53,977 --> 00:46:54,978
Just as expected,

715
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:57,105
I'm not panicking.

716
00:46:57,189 --> 00:46:59,316
I'll be going now.

717
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:10,369
Is this enough,
or do you want to hug a little longer?

718
00:47:17,709 --> 00:47:18,710
A little longer.
