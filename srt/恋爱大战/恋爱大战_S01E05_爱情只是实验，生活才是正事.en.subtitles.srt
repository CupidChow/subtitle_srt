1
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:23,523
LOVE TO HATE YOU

2
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:28,236
When did you start liking me?

3
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:29,446
A special gift!

4
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,034
You get a date with me!

5
00:00:34,117 --> 00:00:35,910
We can get some nice food
and go for a drive.

6
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:37,704
Do you have anything else in mind?

7
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:42,167
Did I go as far as to seduce
Nam Kang-ho just now?

8
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:46,129
Thank you!

9
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:47,464
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

10
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:51,926
Is it sore where I hit you?

11
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:53,261
No, I'm fine.

12
00:00:57,766 --> 00:01:00,185
I don't often do this,
even at my fan meets.

13
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:02,103
Here.

14
00:01:18,369 --> 00:01:20,371
Okay, thank you.

15
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:22,499
I feel all right.

16
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:26,377
Excuse me?

17
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:28,129
I'm very thankful, so--

18
00:01:29,506 --> 00:01:30,632
I'm not panicking.

19
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:33,593
What is this?

20
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:55,740
EPISODE 5

21
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:58,409
LOVE IS JUST AN EXPERIMENT
LIFE IS THE REAL THING

22
00:01:58,493 --> 00:01:59,327
NAM DOES IT AGAIN

23
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,745
SETS A RECORD
GOD OF ROMANCE

24
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:01,996
TAG: #NAMKANGHOROMANCE

25
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,581
KANG-HO, SE-NA
IN YOO SUNG-JUN FILM

26
00:02:03,665 --> 00:02:04,749
NEW FILM SHADOW

27
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,376
WILL NAM BECOME YOO'S MUSE?

28
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:16,094
They say things can develop fast
between a man and a woman.

29
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,139
You got fired quickly, as the saying goes.

30
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:21,349
-Did you seduce him?
-Who, me?

31
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:25,103
Why are you so upset?
It's reasonable suspicion.

32
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:29,149
We hired you to work for Choi Soo-jin,
and you pulled all kinds of tricks on Nam.

33
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:31,276
And what? A sparring partner?

34
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:33,778
Did you enjoy tangling
and wrestling with him?

35
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:38,491
Don't tell me you're going to get sued
for sexual harassment!

36
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:41,661
I should be the one suing him!

37
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:44,038
Nam Kang-ho made a move on me!

38
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:48,209
So I drew a clear line,
and then he fired me out of embarrassment!

39
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:51,754
I've made a big mistake.

40
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,425
They say you should never tell divas
that they're pretty.

41
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:56,926
Do you want to see a counselor?

42
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,011
Jeez, fuh…

43
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:01,181
"Fuh"? What was that?
Did you just curse at me?

44
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:02,807
No, sir! Photo!

45
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:04,809
I wish there was one
to prove my innocence!

46
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,477
Close it gently.

47
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:19,532
I'm very thankful, so--

48
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,123
Oh my. He sure is good-looking.

49
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:05,078
Man, I told you
she'd cross the line, didn't I?

50
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:06,788
I told you to be careful.

51
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:11,167
I knew she'd cling to you and hug you
using training as an excuse,

52
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,169
which could have triggered an attack.

53
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:16,464
You only got your butt kicked
in the process

54
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:18,758
and didn't get much training done. Jeez.

55
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:21,094
Why did you wake up
only after you got beaten up?

56
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:23,304
You should have listened to me before.

57
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:25,890
You're right.

58
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:28,935
So, how far did she go?

59
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,104
Did she kiss you?

60
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:32,647
No.

61
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:35,817
I'm asking because you terminated her
as your attorney.

62
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:39,696
Hey, are you…

63
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:46,953
-You didn't blow your cover, did you?
-I didn't.

64
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,005
I'm not panicking.

65
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:00,008
What is this?

66
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:30,913
The fan service stops here.

67
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:35,168
It didn't trigger an attack.
That was not an attack…

68
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:38,629
Excuse me? What did you just say that was?

69
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:39,839
"Fan service"?

70
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:44,927
To be honest,
I've never done this much for a fan.

71
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:49,932
I hope this will be remembered
as a cherished memory for you.

72
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,351
"Cherished memory"?

73
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,437
Oh my God!

74
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:57,815
-Do you think I enjoyed that?
-What?

75
00:05:58,524 --> 00:05:59,359
You mean, me?

76
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,486
Am I supposed to feel blessed?

77
00:06:01,569 --> 00:06:03,613
You hugged and kissed me at your whim!

78
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:10,495
Damn it. I can't let this go.

79
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:12,955
Whoa!

80
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,291
I have to confess. I was never your fan.

81
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,378
I tripped you on purpose before
because you're a jerk!

82
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:21,339
In fact,
that wasn't the first day I met you.

83
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:23,716
I saw you before
in the resort parking lot!

84
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,053
"Her goal is to get a rich man anyway.
Why does she even work?"

85
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:28,763
"Oh, yeah. That's right!"

86
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:31,057
"So she can be worth more?"

87
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:34,727
"So she can be worth more and more
and sell herself

88
00:06:34,811 --> 00:06:36,229
to the man who pays the most!"

89
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:39,607
"Yeah, well,
that's what every woman dreams of!"

90
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:48,408
And yet, you insisted
on being my attorney?

91
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:50,827
Yeah, well,

92
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:54,038
anti-fans are relentless.

93
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,963
But I was drunk!

94
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:06,175
How did I not get a single word wrong?

95
00:07:13,057 --> 00:07:14,475
Am I a genius?

96
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:17,145
I thought I was the hard-working type.

97
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:21,107
Yeah, well, anti-fans are relentless.

98
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:24,026
I had no idea.

99
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,628
I had no idea.

100
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:44,172
Damn it!

101
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:47,175
You had no idea. So, what? What?

102
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,010
So, what?

103
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:53,097
All done.

104
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,308
Wow, so pretty!

105
00:07:59,562 --> 00:08:02,273
What's all this? Why am I so shiny?

106
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:04,901
Not shiny,
but twinkle-twinkle, bling-bling.

107
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:06,903
I used pearls to make you look lively.

108
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,322
Not lively, but natural. I want natural.

109
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:11,949
This is natural for a celebrity.
You can't go barefaced.

110
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,577
Do it again quickly.
Make me look pale and sick.

111
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:15,786
Not lively.

112
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:20,291
The thought of her all dolled up
and trying to be cute makes me…

113
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,585
Damn.

114
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,421
She's not a simple girl, you know.

115
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,590
She won't make it easy to hate her.

116
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:29,383
You'll see.

117
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:32,637
I bet she's going to pretend
like she's had a rough time.

118
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,349
You were right.

119
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,768
I told you.

120
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,395
We meet at last.

121
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,484
Have you been well?

122
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:58,496
We're sorry
about what happened in the past.

123
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:01,082
We wrongly accused you of being a stalker

124
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:03,668
and haven't had the chance
to apologize until now.

125
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,628
It's not like you haven't had the chance.

126
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:09,298
There were plenty of times
when we ran into each other, right?

127
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:16,013
Let's not talk about the past
or our personal affairs.

128
00:09:18,474 --> 00:09:19,809
I'm sorry to inform you,

129
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,937
but something urgent has come up.
The director won't be coming.

130
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:28,234
Yes, we've deposited 30 million won
for the treatment.

131
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:30,736
Her background check was clear,
so she'll be out soon.

132
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:32,697
Okay, I'll see you then.

133
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,074
You go, girl!

134
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,334
How about a drink tonight? I'm buying.

135
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,588
Who's up for a drink tonight?

136
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:49,547
-Wait--
-Oh, me!

137
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,132
I was hoping we could eat alone.

138
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:52,383
This gentleman is buying!

139
00:09:52,466 --> 00:09:54,385
All right, then.
I'll only take one person!

140
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:57,179
Just one person.

141
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,764
I'll meet you there!

142
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,224
I respectfully decline.

143
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:03,019
-Looking forward to it!
-You're leaving like that? Hey.

144
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:06,188
You have to come.
You made the party so big.

145
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:09,900
Not easy as expected.
I'll let you off because you're cute.

146
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:11,861
She has very high standards.

147
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:17,908
Are you okay?

148
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:19,785
Sure, thanks to everyone's concern.

149
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,538
Coffee?

150
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:26,334
They must be looking for
a chance to hit on you.

151
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:29,045
I know. But everyone is so ordinary.

152
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:30,338
There is no surprise.

153
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:31,797
What happened with Nam Kang-ho?

154
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:44,060
I asked you for the job.
Sorry I can't be of help.

155
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,395
-Did something happen?
-Like what?

156
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,647
Did you sleep with him?

157
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,400
Oh, it's against the contract
to disclose a client's personal life.

158
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,862
You think my personal life
is okay to share with you?

159
00:10:54,945 --> 00:10:55,821
Stay in your lane.

160
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,784
So this is why
the guys you dated ended up ruined.

161
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:02,370
It's like you never liked them at all.

162
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,288
Like they don't matter to you.

163
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:08,125
I gave you a reason to act that way,
so I understand.

164
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:10,044
That's probably why you revenge-cheated.

165
00:11:12,213 --> 00:11:14,632
Why must there be a reason
when girls cheat on men?

166
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:17,802
I'm just as flirtatious
as any ordinary man!

167
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:20,304
Don't feel responsible
for my flirty nature.

168
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:21,472
You're really…

169
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,272
-Yes, Mr. Ko.
-Emergency!

170
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:32,608
You and Yeo Mi-ran, get in here right now!

171
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:36,862
I heard he had such a hard time
after kissing an actress on set,

172
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,948
he even showed symptoms of nausea.

173
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,200
That's why he does his very best

174
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:45,705
when he has to shoot a kissing scene
so that he can get it done in one go.

175
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:50,334
There's even a rumor about him
and CEO Do being long-time lovers.

176
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:54,130
Do follows him to all of his shoots,
including out-of-town film sets.

177
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:57,216
A CEO does that?
When there are managers and stylists?

178
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:00,594
And reportedly,
they always sleep in the same room.

179
00:12:00,678 --> 00:12:01,804
Take a look at this.

180
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,557
This is from a café this morning!

181
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:10,813
When men go to a café, it's for a contract

182
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:13,733
or to borrow money
or something like that, right?

183
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,901
Wow, they look so sweet together!

184
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:18,362
Maybe they spent the night together.

185
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,698
I think all the pieces
are coming together now

186
00:12:20,781 --> 00:12:23,325
as to why he's never had
any dating rumors until now.

187
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:27,079
You said that
Nam Kang-ho made a move on you?

188
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,543
So, are you a dude? Transgender?

189
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:36,088
No, these are the guys who spread
fake news about Ms. Choi, remember?

190
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,716
I never thought of Nam Kang-ho
like that, but wow.

191
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,843
There's nothing wrong with being gay.

192
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,762
The best result would be to prove

193
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,514
that the gay rumor is false
and help Nam maintain his role!

194
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:49,935
Gathering evidence and hashing it out
in court later is a "not bad" result.

195
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:51,979
But I expect you to get the best result!

196
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:54,023
-Do I have to work alone?
-Then what?

197
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,691
Have both of them on the case.

198
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,152
Yeo can stay behind
when meeting with Nam Kang-ho.

199
00:12:58,235 --> 00:13:00,488
My goodness.

200
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,865
In my day,

201
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:06,660
I single-handedly handled
over 30 of these kinds of cases in a week.

202
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:09,789
These law school babies
don't have the stamina.

203
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:12,500
They need to revive
the national bar exam. Jeez.

204
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:15,044
NAM KANG-HO IS GAY?

205
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,670
DID NAM KANG-HO GET OUTED?

206
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:18,047
NAM'S AGENCY STRONGLY DENIES

207
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,465
FAKE NEWS, JUST A RUMOR

208
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:21,842
NAM SWEPT UP IN GAY RUMOR

209
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,803
NAM'S GAY RUMOR SPREADS LIKE WILDFIRE

210
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:24,887
NAUSEA AFTER KISSING

211
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:26,388
REPORTEDLY LONG-TIME LOVERS

212
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,016
MOVIE PRODUCTION STOPS

213
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,102
Why did you take me to a café?

214
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:35,856
Dude, I was craving Eggs Benedict.
What can I say?

215
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,982
Can you make it?

216
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,401
The blue underwear
that we bought together.

217
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,070
Throw it away.

218
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:41,987
Hey.

219
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:45,908
That's one of my favorites.
You throw away yours.

220
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:47,576
I bought that for you.

221
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,287
You got it for free, so you throw it away.

222
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:54,166
Oh, this cheap bastard! Wow, seriously.

223
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,336
So this is where the word
"cheap-ass" comes from.

224
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:58,921
I'm disappointed in the director.

225
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:01,799
How could he do this
without even hearing me out?

226
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:05,719
The investors were going to pull
their money out, so he had no choice.

227
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,650
Kang-ho,
let's expose your past relationship.

228
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:20,734
What?

229
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:26,115
About you and Se-na.
It won't cause any big impact now.

230
00:14:26,198 --> 00:14:27,700
And it'll help promote the film.

231
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:30,786
Judging by how Se-na is right now,
she'll definitely say yes.

232
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:33,831
Are you making that serious face?

233
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:36,125
Well, you can
kiss this film goodbye, then.

234
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,501
Man, this is so frustrating.

235
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:40,462
Let's meet and talk. I'll come to you.

236
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:41,630
Are you crazy?

237
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,300
Your place and my place
are the most dangerous right now.

238
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,760
-Let's meet at another location.
-Where?

239
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,012
Your second house.

240
00:14:48,095 --> 00:14:50,014
JEONGHA DETENTION CENTER

241
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,313
-Welcome back, ma'am.
-You've been through a lot.

242
00:14:57,855 --> 00:14:59,481
You want me to eat that here?

243
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:05,154
Do you not see the eyes looking at us
from over there and over there?

244
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:06,780
Sorry. You could go to the car--

245
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,032
Want to have a drink?

246
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:10,993
Oh, I'm sorry.
I have some urgent matters to attend to.

247
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:13,203
Oh, Nam Kang-ho?

248
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,916
That news made its way
into this detention center.

249
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,834
This must be a headache for Won-jun.

250
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,794
I'd better not give him more trouble.

251
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:23,797
But then, if we don't cause any trouble,

252
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,758
the lawyers will have no work, right?

253
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:32,348
So, what's your plan for Nam Kang-ho?

254
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:35,184
First, we'll pressure them to retract
and say it wasn't true.

255
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:38,062
Who cares about retraction stories?
They're boring.

256
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:40,689
Bad and strange news is

257
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,400
much more interesting
than good and ordinary news.

258
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:47,488
You signed a confidentiality agreement
when you were hired, right?

259
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:48,447
Do you know why?

260
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:52,076
To prevent you from talking in public
about all the fun stuff.

261
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:54,912
Which story do you find interesting?
The good or the bad?

262
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,957
Only a strong story
can cover up a strong story.

263
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:02,878
It will be hard for Kang-ho
unless something even more fun comes up.

264
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:26,986
It's Hwang Ji-hye.

265
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:29,571
My thoughts as well.

266
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,741
So I told Gilmu to take action.

267
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:36,078
What action?
It's all speculation and no evidence.

268
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:40,249
Well, you can't just sit back
and take all the punches.

269
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:45,045
What's all this?

270
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,006
What's with all the cameras?

271
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:48,966
-Was it always like this?
-I'm recording.

272
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:52,136
I want to see how I do
in this kind of crappy situation.

273
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:54,388
My lifelong dream is shattered,

274
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:57,099
and now I have this desire to kill,
but I just can't.

275
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,851
I want to use it in acting later.

276
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:02,438
Okay, Kang-ho. Just like you said,

277
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:05,691
if all these experiences
are somehow meaningful to an actor,

278
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:10,070
I think a really dramatic experience
in real life wouldn't be a bad idea.

279
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:11,822
What?

280
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:16,660
Se-na sent this to me.

281
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:19,663
She had this picture after all this time.

282
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,957
-Hey!
-Don't try to walk over me!

283
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,794
You and I share the same birth year,
but everything else is different!

284
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:29,006
When you were in 9th grade, I was in 10th.
You went to college in '05. I in '04.

285
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:31,258
Your zodiac sign is tiger, and mine is ox!

286
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:34,511
Hey, you. It's about time you drop
that kind of ancient custom, right?

287
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:37,723
A CEO sticking to such antiquities.
No wonder I'm not a global star.

288
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:39,224
What, global star?

289
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,561
That's yours to achieve.
Why do you push that onto me--

290
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:48,233
Be calm. I said, be calm.

291
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:52,446
If you have an inkling of hope to be
in Yoo's film, don't mess this up.

292
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:53,405
Okay?

293
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:55,908
Come in.

294
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:04,917
I brought her here.

295
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:09,338
You've become allies?

296
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:12,424
Did you share walnut cookies
on your way here too?

297
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:15,177
We had sotteok. Okay?

298
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,428
Are you happy?

299
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:17,513
Won-jun.

300
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:20,682
I'll tell him.

301
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,854
I think it's really unfair

302
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:29,983
that such a baseless rumor stops you
from acting in a film you wanted.

303
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:36,406
It's not a bad idea, but I don't like it.

304
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:40,244
Anyway, thanks for your concern.

305
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:41,745
I guess we're done here.

306
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:55,759
Hey.

307
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,011
I wish you wouldn't do that.

308
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,598
I've missed you.

309
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:07,771
I've missed you so much, Kang-ho.

310
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:17,072
First love Asako is long gone.

311
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,908
So don't be gross, and just go.

312
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,582
Yeah, Kang-ho. Are you done talking?

313
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,460
You came here together,
so you can leave together.

314
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,089
What's wrong with that prick?

315
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:36,300
He told me

316
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,094
to stop being gross.

317
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,180
Why did you have to cry and be all gross--

318
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:47,186
Gross? Did you say "gross"?

319
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,484
-What's all this?
-Security cameras.

320
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,587
I really want to do this movie.

321
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:58,257
Damn it.

322
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,054
Didn't I tell you?

323
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:06,390
Kang-ho would be much harsher than me.

324
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:26,326
Are you sure those cameras
back there were turned off?

325
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,454
It's not going to get leaked?

326
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:35,669
Even if those cameras were on,
do you think he would do such a thing?

327
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:39,006
He never did one bad thing in revenge
when you betrayed him.

328
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:42,134
He kept it all repressed
and even got sick--

329
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:45,846
He got sick?

330
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:48,015
He was just in a lot of pain.

331
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:53,228
You're right.
I deserve to be treated this way.

332
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:54,980
I fully deserve it.

333
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:03,488
I'm glad that at least
you're over that whole thing.

334
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:05,907
What did you say?

335
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:10,871
REPORTER PARK

336
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:21,298
Hey, how are you, Mr. Park?
It's been a while.

337
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:23,800
God, Mr. Do,
you must be under a lot of stress.

338
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:25,510
Yes, well.

339
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:27,637
It's completely false, so…

340
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,182
Yeah, it's going to pass soon.

341
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:32,100
Of course, I would know.

342
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,186
I even have a scoop
on Mr. Nam's love story.

343
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:37,773
-Along with irrefutable evidence.
-I'm sorry?

344
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,733
Let's meet first. Where are you?

345
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:41,943
Yes. Right now, I'm…

346
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,112
I'm outside the city.

347
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:46,323
Then call me once you get back to Seoul.

348
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:48,700
Okay. Wait--

349
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:51,244
-What is this?
-It wasn't me.

350
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:54,748
Even the picture I gave you
was all I could barely find.

351
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,251
Did someone else tip it off?

352
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:00,754
Does anyone from the theater company
know about you two?

353
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,215
No one knows.

354
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:08,053
Anyway, if that reporter breaks the story,

355
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:09,846
please make it clear to Kang-ho.

356
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,515
I didn't do it.

357
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:24,778
Given the circumstances,
I think Mr. Do is right.

358
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:28,448
I knew Hwang Ji-hye was the type
to do something like this.

359
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:33,412
Then the first thing we should do
is pressure the informant.

360
00:23:35,414 --> 00:23:36,790
Let's go fishing.

361
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:39,751
You think she'll take the bait?

362
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:42,045
We just sit and wait until the fish bites.

363
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:45,757
Not even Mr. Nam Kang-ho was complaining
about staying at a tourist hotel,

364
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:48,093
but she said she only sleeps
at a five-star hotel.

365
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:50,095
The show costs so much money already,

366
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:52,264
and she's so fussy
about product placement!

367
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:54,099
In a scene, she wouldn't put on makeup

368
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:57,018
because she thought she might get
a cosmetics commercial later.

369
00:23:57,102 --> 00:24:01,231
I heard her cussing at an older stylist
who is more experienced than she is.

370
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:06,027
I'm telling you.
We didn't spread the rumor about Mr. Nam.

371
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:10,031
Come on. The show is still on the air.
Why would we do something like that?

372
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:10,949
Of course.

373
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,870
Mr. Nam felt bad that this happened
while the show's still on the air.

374
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:17,080
We can't afford a scandal
with Ms. Hwang as well,

375
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:20,417
so we'll do our best
to make sure this doesn't get leaked.

376
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,420
Are you people blackmailing us?

377
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:24,963
It wasn't me!

378
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:27,716
Mr. Yoon, it wasn't me. I'm serious!

379
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:30,302
Oh my. We were not accusing you.

380
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:33,763
We were actually suspecting Mr. Yoon.

381
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,810
But it seems Ms. Hwang clearly knows
that it wasn't Mr. Yoon.

382
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:42,022
I mean,

383
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:43,690
I was just…

384
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:49,779
I'm sorry!

385
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:53,366
What the-- Are you a moron?
Why are you admitting it?

386
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,743
Oh God!

387
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:59,164
We looked into a few more things,
and you have other allegations too.

388
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:00,081
What?

389
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:04,169
Unpaid wages, verbal and physical abuse.

390
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:05,670
I'm letting you know in advance

391
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:09,007
that your assets can all be frozen
if you're sued on these matters.

392
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,258
"Frozen"?

393
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:14,513
I do hope you'll be able to clean up
your own mess in a prompt manner.

394
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:25,440
Let me take that for you.

395
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:26,399
SHIN NA-EUN

396
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:27,400
Na-eun.

397
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,448
I'm sorry about that.

398
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:36,451
-One more glass, please.
-The same drink?

399
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:47,879
More!

400
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,181
Man, that's sour!

401
00:25:58,265 --> 00:26:00,892
Yeah, it's sour. Shin Na-eun.

402
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:04,104
You have a pretty name and a pretty face.

403
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,065
Thank you, sir.

404
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,528
If he touches me,
I can just report him for harassment.

405
00:26:12,028 --> 00:26:13,530
But he comes on too vaguely.

406
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:16,783
If there's a crash,
we should abandon someone like him.

407
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:20,579
I'm not sure if he deserves to die though.

408
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:22,080
Na-eun!

409
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:23,999
Hey, Shin Na-eun!

410
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:26,376
You're so pretty!

411
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,629
Watch carefully. This is a phone, right?

412
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:32,215
If you give me your number,

413
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:34,759
I'll put in a good review for you!

414
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:38,013
-Is that meant to be funny?
-Hey.

415
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,472
Just keep walking.

416
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:42,601
-Hey, your number!
-Don't save him. Let him die.

417
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:43,768
Damn it!

418
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:45,854
TRANSFER PAGE
AMOUNT: 181,818

419
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:48,273
Another rage deposit?

420
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:53,111
If this happened at a bar or a club,
I wouldn't be this upset.

421
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:56,781
I'd just be like,
"I guess I really am pretty."

422
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:59,951
I'd still be upset
if someone was that rude to me.

423
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,453
Yeah, I guess.

424
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:02,954
But at clubs,

425
00:27:03,038 --> 00:27:06,416
guys risk getting rejected and humiliated.

426
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:10,503
But in my case, I have to risk my job
if I were to raise my voice at him.

427
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:14,841
You should have taken a selfie with him
in case I run into him someday.

428
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:16,843
And he wasn't even handsome.

429
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:19,179
I can't even get close to his face!

430
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:25,143
You must be having fun
with a hot guy like Nam Kang-ho.

431
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,145
You don't work for fun.

432
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:30,899
I find it more fun to fly
when there are hot celebrities on board.

433
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:36,655
-Let's go and blow off steam.
-Go where?

434
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:38,198
To solve guy problems with guys.

435
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:42,661
-Let's go!
-Do you think that makes sense right now?

436
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:49,084
It's not a bad night, huh?

437
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:51,002
Are the hot guys making you feel better?

438
00:27:51,086 --> 00:27:52,962
Don't bring me to a place like this!

439
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:56,299
I'm too old to waste time on guys
based on their looks.

440
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:59,386
Jeez, I'm not telling you to date them.
Just enjoy the night.

441
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:01,554
And get used to
being around handsome guys!

442
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:03,640
I guess I will!

443
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:20,573
I wanted to rule over the men
who desired me.

444
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:25,870
The easier they thought I was,
the heavier my punishments were on them.

445
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:28,707
Did I ever have
a heart-fluttering romance?

446
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:37,298
Hey, Shin Na-eun!

447
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:40,552
Hey! Wow!

448
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:43,096
-This is insane!
-Someone you know?

449
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,893
A pretty girl next to another pretty girl!

450
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:51,229
The obnoxious man from the plane.

451
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:55,191
Oh, I'm sorry if I offended you earlier!

452
00:28:55,275 --> 00:29:00,363
You know how guys tease pretty girls
just to get their attention!

453
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:02,741
So, is this you apologizing?

454
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:05,910
No. He's being obnoxious again
because he wants to hang out.

455
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,829
Oh, just come with me!

456
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:10,665
I brought something fun from America!

457
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,293
-Something fun?
-Yeah.

458
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,754
It's super fun!

459
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:20,258
What could that be? I'm really curious.

460
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:21,301
Hey!

461
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,387
Hang on. I want to check something.

462
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:27,182
Come in.

463
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:30,185
Na-eun, come in!

464
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,188
Move!

465
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,282
Stay next to me.
Don't eat anything. Not even water!

466
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:48,077
Guys, what are you doing? Drink!

467
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:51,164
Let's drink up!

468
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:53,750
Bottoms up!

469
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:06,387
Irrefutable evidence. I told you, right?

470
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:10,266
Wait, it looks like
you didn't know about this.

471
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,227
Don't you know this woman?

472
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:15,230
To tell you the truth,
we weren't paying attention to Mr. Nam.

473
00:30:15,313 --> 00:30:17,565
We've chased him for years
but got nothing.

474
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,526
But then someone showed me this.

475
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:23,947
First, I thought it might be edited,
but it turned out to be real.

476
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:26,616
So we bought it. It cost us quite a bit.

477
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:31,287
Well, this is a problem.

478
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:33,289
Since you spent so much money on this,

479
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:38,795
I don't think you can simply cover it up
just because I asked you to.

480
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:40,547
What should we do about this?

481
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:43,091
Oh, you want this covered up?
Then I'll cover it up.

482
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,051
What?

483
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:47,428
You can see that
this was taken before the scandal.

484
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:51,182
Thus, it shows that this wasn't staged
just to downplay the gay rumor.

485
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:52,976
You can clear Nam's name easily

486
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:55,478
and humiliate the jerks
who use rumors to ruin people.

487
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:56,688
How great is this?

488
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:58,356
So you're asking for money.

489
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:00,149
Oh man.

490
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:03,987
Wow, I've spent money
on covering up scandals, but this is…

491
00:31:04,988 --> 00:31:06,906
It's not like Mr. Nam did something bad.

492
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:10,451
But it would take years
for the gay rumor to die down.

493
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:14,747
Has there ever been a gay actor in Korea?
I wonder if he can stay in the business.

494
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:17,959
Come on, Mr. Park. Hold up.
Why are you in such a hurry?

495
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:21,796
I just got the gist
of what you were trying to tell me.

496
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:24,048
And I've been thinking for a second

497
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:26,593
about how much would satisfy you.

498
00:31:26,676 --> 00:31:30,763
"I think I should have a conversation
with Mr. Park about these things."

499
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:33,099
That's what I've been thinking about.

500
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:52,744
That keeps the smell from leaking out.

501
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:59,000
This is so freaking fun!

502
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:04,005
They're on their way, so let's leave.
Act naturally.

503
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:05,340
Okay.

504
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:07,300
-Shall we go dance?
-Shall we?

505
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:10,428
Where the hell are you going?

506
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:12,347
Hey!

507
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:15,433
What the hell is wrong
with you ugly bitches?

508
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:18,102
We're here to have fun.
Why don't you drink?

509
00:32:18,186 --> 00:32:19,270
We did drink.

510
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,773
We just drank two shots.

511
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:25,276
Then give this a try.

512
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:28,112
I'm okay.

513
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,490
We have to use the ladies' room.

514
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:33,034
Damn it, just try it once!

515
00:32:33,910 --> 00:32:35,787
It's safer than alcohol!

516
00:32:37,038 --> 00:32:39,207
Try it once. Just once.

517
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,292
It's freaking fun, I'm telling you!

518
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:42,585
I don't want to.

519
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:46,422
Shit, you're freaking boring.
You stupid little bitches.

520
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:17,870
You little--

521
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:28,423
Na-eun, let's go.

522
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:30,091
-Yes, ma'am.
-Where are you going?

523
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,135
Oh my God!

524
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:44,022
Hey!

525
00:33:48,568 --> 00:33:50,653
What did you say? We're ugly?

526
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:55,241
How are we ugly?
Is there something wrong with your eyes?

527
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:59,871
Oh, Detective!

528
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:03,207
Waiter!

529
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:04,959
Call 911!

530
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,047
It hurts so much!

531
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:10,256
Damn it!

532
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:13,509
You'll have to pay me a fortune
for treatment and compensation!

533
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:15,053
You, you'd better be ready!

534
00:34:15,136 --> 00:34:17,138
-Excuse me!
-Hey!

535
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,307
Ha!

536
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:22,060
I should have broken his jaw
to shut him up.

537
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:25,855
Why would you pay for his treatment?
You got these junkies arrested.

538
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:28,357
Laws are cold-hearted.
They don't work as we'd like.

539
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:30,902
And you still beat them up?

540
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:33,946
How much will it cost?

541
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,949
I didn't break any bones,
so four weeks at the most?

542
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:39,118
That's four million won, then.

543
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:42,038
That's the going rate,
but he'll ask for a ridiculous amount.

544
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:43,706
You're the ridiculous one.

545
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:47,085
How can you call yourself a lawyer
when you use fists more than the law?

546
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,421
Oh God, it's all my fault!

547
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:53,091
Only if I hadn't told you
that's the guy from the plane…

548
00:34:58,387 --> 00:34:59,806
Come on out.

549
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:01,516
You can stay.

550
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:02,517
What?

551
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:11,067
-We'll call you if we need statements.
-Sure. Have a good night.

552
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,151
Good night.

553
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:18,282
That's it? There's no reward?

554
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:22,620
Only if we help arrest sellers,
not those who just possess them.

555
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:26,207
We have to pay the rent
and the settlement.

556
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:27,834
Please don't mess up at work.

557
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:32,171
When will Nam pay you
for that expensive part-time work?

558
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:34,799
Oh.

559
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:36,259
He fired me.

560
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,469
Didn't you do one session?

561
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:40,680
Yeah.

562
00:35:40,763 --> 00:35:42,640
You got fired after just one session?

563
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,476
Yeah.

564
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:50,398
Did you beat him to a pulp
like you did with those guys?

565
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:54,485
No, that's not why I got fired.

566
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:55,820
Then what?

567
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:58,364
What could be worse than that?

568
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:03,077
I just thought
he was kind of full of himself.

569
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,162
And?

570
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:08,040
So I called him a jerk.

571
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:09,458
You called him a jerk?

572
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:12,003
-To his face?
-Yeah.

573
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,382
I was crazy to say that to a client.

574
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:18,509
Even if he weren't a client,

575
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:21,137
how can you say
something like that to someone?

576
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,889
I did wrong, didn't I?

577
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:26,767
This is a first.
Admitting you did a man wrong.

578
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,312
I didn't tell him that yet.

579
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:33,316
Oh, damn it. That's right.
I haven't apologized.

580
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:37,653
What now?

581
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,910
The person who crossed the line

582
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:47,038
wasn't the lawyer, don't you think?

583
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,875
Even if she first seduced you,

584
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:55,421
you're the one who did this
of your own will!

585
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:56,797
Where did you get this?

586
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:00,051
Who's the reporter?
How much do they want? I'll pay.

587
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:01,260
You didn't have an attack?

588
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:05,389
-You were okay?
-Yeah.

589
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:08,851
-I don't know how.
-Huh?

590
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:13,439
So, then what?

591
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:15,942
Then what happened? After this.

592
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:18,194
Nothing. That was it.

593
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:20,404
Why?

594
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:21,572
What do you mean "why"?

595
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:24,575
Why did you stop?
You should have kept going!

596
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:26,535
You said that she likes you too!

597
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,497
She doesn't like me.

598
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,085
What?

599
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:35,628
But she's your fan!

600
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:38,798
What, is every fan supposed to want
to go out with me?

601
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,676
What's with the sudden overreaction?

602
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:42,718
Did you get rejected?

603
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,055
Hey, did you get rejected

604
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:48,391
and then fire her because you were mad?

605
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:00,403
ATTORNEY YEO MI-RAN

606
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:09,203
Yes.

607
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:11,706
I sincerely apologize.

608
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:13,624
I'm really sorry.

609
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:16,794
I'm also sorry that I offended you.

610
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:19,130
I ruined your birthday.

611
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:20,798
Oh, no.

612
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:23,301
I'm the one who made you
misunderstand things.

613
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,052
And I also made a mistake.

614
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:28,764
MISTAKE

615
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:32,435
Mistake, yes. I overreacted
when I called it fan service.

616
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,062
FAN SERVICE

617
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,439
Oh, I almost forgot.

618
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:38,357
I'll send you the money for your work.

619
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:41,277
Oh, okay. Thank you for your time.
I know you have a lot on your mind.

620
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:43,321
A lot on my mind?

621
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:46,782
But that stuff about me is not true.

622
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:49,577
Oh. Sure, of course.

623
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,078
All right, then.

624
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,163
Bye.

625
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:57,877
What was that about?

626
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:01,130
-Does she have a boyfriend?
-Oh God!

627
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:04,925
Okay, so…

628
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:07,386
Is that why she rejected you?

629
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:11,766
I know it's not true
when you give me fan service like that.

630
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,769
Being a top star is a tough job.

631
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:19,732
Yes, Mr. Do.

632
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,236
CEO DO WON-JUN
J BAR

633
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:26,405
For members only?

634
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:31,660
Why did you want to see me?

635
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,622
Let's have a drink first.

636
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:46,634
Cheers?

637
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:48,135
Oh, okay.

638
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:59,188
I heard Kang-ho had made
a faux pas in front of you.

639
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,818
What faux pas?

640
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:09,115
But even to my eyes,
you did appear to really like Kang-ho.

641
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:11,992
That's probably why
Kang-ho didn't expect to get rejected

642
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:14,078
and did it.

643
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:15,830
What did he do?

644
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:17,581
How should I put it…

645
00:40:18,624 --> 00:40:22,044
Like a gesture that shows he likes you?

646
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:24,422
Mr. Nam Kang-ho said he likes me?

647
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:26,757
He did that without even telling you?

648
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:27,758
That bastard--

649
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:32,138
Wait, did he say that I rejected him
after he told me that he liked me?

650
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:33,347
You didn't reject him?

651
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,100
Were you just playing hard to get?

652
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:38,310
No, I don't do stuff like that.

653
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:46,235
Are you disappointed right now?

654
00:40:46,318 --> 00:40:47,278
Yes.

655
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:50,072
I really wish everything would go well
between you two.

656
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:53,159
God, it pains me
to see you two like this.

657
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,414
But you found me "unsettling."

658
00:40:58,497 --> 00:40:59,707
What?

659
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,625
I heard it all on speakerphone.

660
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:05,504
Oh, back then, there was
some misunderstanding on my part--

661
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:07,214
I'm sorry.

662
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:10,634
Is your misunderstanding resolved now?

663
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:14,138
But there was nothing to resolve
in the first place.

664
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:33,073
Okay. If you look at this, well,

665
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:36,076
it does appear
that Kang-ho made the move, right?

666
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,703
Who took this photo?

667
00:41:37,786 --> 00:41:39,622
It was an anonymous informant.

668
00:41:39,705 --> 00:41:41,332
I got them from a reporter I know.

669
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,293
Will this be released to the public?

670
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:45,294
Probably.

671
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:48,589
But it was taken without consent!

672
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:51,634
We can take legal action.
Would you like me to stop it?

673
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,762
No. Could you perhaps just

674
00:41:55,304 --> 00:41:56,931
admit to everything?

675
00:41:58,974 --> 00:41:59,892
A love affair

676
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:02,228
with Kang-ho.

677
00:42:07,274 --> 00:42:09,360
Oh, why can't you say it?

678
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:12,446
"It turns out the informant was wrong!"

679
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:15,783
Why can't you just say that?

680
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:18,953
Come on!

681
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:20,955
You can't take back what you gave us.

682
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:23,249
You should have thought this through!

683
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:27,670
Whether the news is real or fake,
we don't do retractions, okay?

684
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:31,131
You do understand that we live and die
by our credibility, right?

685
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:32,883
What did you say?

686
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:34,927
Hello?

687
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:35,886
What's this?

688
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,137
Huh?

689
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:40,641
I told you not to break stories
without checking them first.

690
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:43,185
Damn it. Hwang Ji-hye!

691
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:46,397
NAM KANG-HO HAS A SECRET GIRLFRIEND!

692
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,690
NAM ADMITS IT?
AGENCY KEEPS MUM

693
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:49,441
WHO IS IN THE PHOTO? A CELEBRITY?

694
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:50,568
GIRLFRIEND, NOT A CELEBRITY

695
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:53,487
Yes, I knew he wasn't gay!

696
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:55,155
I knew it all along, but…

697
00:42:57,199 --> 00:42:58,284
Who is this woman?

698
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:02,329
Where have I seen her?

699
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:03,747
I know I've seen her before.

700
00:43:03,831 --> 00:43:05,833
God, where did I see this chick?

701
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:12,006
NAM'S GIRLFRIEND
PRESUMED NONCELEBRITY

702
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:36,113
Do you think we are being watched
at this moment?

703
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:38,782
Maybe?

704
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:40,659
Then we have to do something.

705
00:43:58,427 --> 00:43:59,678
Seat belt.

706
00:44:03,515 --> 00:44:04,600
Seat belt.
