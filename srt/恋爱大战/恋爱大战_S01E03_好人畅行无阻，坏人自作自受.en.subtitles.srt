1
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:23,523
LOVE TO HATE YOU

2
00:00:23,606 --> 00:00:26,359
You must be cold. Let's get inside.

3
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,028
Let's go.

4
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:30,113
-I'll order something delicious.
-What the hell?

5
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:32,782
-Bye.
-Good night.

6
00:00:37,787 --> 00:00:39,456
I just hate all grown-up women.

7
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:47,172
Shit!

8
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:54,679
Yes! They are outside.

9
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:59,267
Here, take care.

10
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,024
Hello.

11
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:09,360
What the hell?

12
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:11,780
Is he an undercover president?

13
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:14,866
It seems like someone aimed
at the camera directly.

14
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,077
Do you have any ideas?

15
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:17,994
No.

16
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:21,247
Well, die-hard fans are always around me.

17
00:01:27,796 --> 00:01:28,797
EPISODE 3

18
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,882
NICE GUYS GET A PASS
BAD BOYS HAVE IT COMING

19
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:34,094
Could she just be a fan?

20
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,179
Or a relative?

21
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:37,597
No.

22
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:39,182
It was late,

23
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:41,059
and she was alone.

24
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,520
There's a thing called a hunch.

25
00:01:46,564 --> 00:01:47,857
The hint of a crime.

26
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:49,609
To a rookie detective,

27
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:51,778
it can't be seen
no matter how hard they look.

28
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:54,948
But once they see it, it's always there.

29
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:04,666
Help me!

30
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:13,883
Professor, 52 years old.

31
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,969
Sugaring his daughter's underage friend.

32
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:17,470
Manager at a big company, 49.

33
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:20,056
Sugaring 13 minors using a messaging app.

34
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:23,643
Male schoolteacher, 47.
Threatening and stalking a female student.

35
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:24,811
Pastor, 46.

36
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:27,730
Sexually extorting 40 minors
over the course of 20 years.

37
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,567
Top star, 36 years old. Sugaring a minor.

38
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:32,819
I just hate all grown-up women.

39
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:36,948
I got a hunch.

40
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:39,617
She's definitely a minor.

41
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:42,287
I'd love to find evidence
and bring Nam Kang-ho down,

42
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:46,541
but the most important thing right now
is to rescue the girl safely.

43
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,293
Look this way, please.

44
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:51,838
Ji-hye, this way. Raise your hand, please.

45
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:53,339
Thank you.

46
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:57,135
To match the vibe of the show, Mr. Nam,
can you please make a finger heart?

47
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,346
Yet another fail!

48
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:04,475
As expected, Mr. Nam is
too much of a gentleman for finger hearts.

49
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:06,728
You two have never worked together before.

50
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:08,605
How are you getting along, acting-wise?

51
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:12,192
I think we are doing very well.

52
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:15,111
We share our thoughts
on the characters and the scenes.

53
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:18,239
The mood on the set is great.

54
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:24,037
We heard you already shot a kissing scene.

55
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,831
What kind of name do you think
this kiss will receive?

56
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,917
I heard someone say "glue kiss."

57
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,961
Why is that?
Because your lips won't come apart?

58
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:34,130
You can check it out when it's released.

59
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:08,456
What about the noise complaint
in Ria's apartment?

60
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,625
They dropped the lawsuit.

61
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,086
I convinced them
it was hard to provide proof of damage.

62
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:15,672
And with four concert tickets
provided by Dowon,

63
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,048
we sealed the deal.

64
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,677
The registration
for Hyeon Chang-min's apartment?

65
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,388
I took care of that already last week.

66
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:26,849
That's our job?

67
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,644
We take care of taxes,
legal, and labor affairs.

68
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,814
If it's legally related to our clients,
we do everything.

69
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:37,568
Oh, Jay from Good Boys. His ex-girlfriend?

70
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,529
She agreed to have an abortion.

71
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:42,240
We paid her 50 million won
for the abortion and secrecy.

72
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,243
That's cheaper than I thought!

73
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:47,245
-Thank you.
-And Min Ju-hyeok?

74
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,205
The additional confession video

75
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,624
and the chat room
with the photos were deleted.

76
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:56,838
Wait.

77
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,382
Isn't that a crime?

78
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,346
I just said the chat room
and the video are deleted.

79
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,479
Oh, right.

80
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,361
You're strong.

81
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,947
Oh, yes. I am.

82
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,449
But you have a weak heart.

83
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,409
You must've had a nice, easy career.

84
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:32,457
Yeah!

85
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,958
I'm here for the money!

86
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,460
The rent.

87
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,295
I'm only here because of the rent!

88
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,593
-It's Kang-ho.
-Kang-ho!

89
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:46,888
-Kang-ho!
-Kang-ho!

90
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,147
Stop here!

91
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,900
-Kang-ho!
-Kang-ho!

92
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:05,198
Kang-ho, did you not read my text?

93
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:07,200
I told you to use the back door.

94
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:11,204
Kang-ho, it's about time
you changed your stylist.

95
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:13,998
When I saw your clothes,
I literally gasped.

96
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:16,167
But still, your answers were witty.

97
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:17,877
See you later, then!

98
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,046
-Bye.
-Kang-ho, you're here.

99
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:22,131
Hurry. Everyone is waiting.

100
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:26,469
Is she still acting like she's a big deal?

101
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:29,305
God, we really need
to do something about her.

102
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,974
Is it crowded outside?

103
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:32,892
Yes.

104
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:36,771
Keep an eye on them,
and if things get serious,

105
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:39,107
call Attorney Lee Jin-suh, okay?

106
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,024
Okay.

107
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:42,068
-Hey, what was that?
-Who are you?

108
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:44,570
Who are you to stand
between us and Kang-ho?

109
00:06:44,654 --> 00:06:47,490
My dear Kang-ho is very tired today.

110
00:06:47,573 --> 00:06:49,492
I want you to know that.

111
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:52,537
-What is she saying?
-Hey, are you his wife? His manager?

112
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,330
I'm the president of his fan club!

113
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,915
Don't act like you're all that!

114
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:58,209
What fan club has a president nowadays?

115
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:00,378
Here. Here's one!

116
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:02,547
-Who's the president?
-Me!

117
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:04,465
What? What are you on about?

118
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:06,217
What?

119
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,596
NAM'S ROMANCE
WILL THE WIN STREAK CONTINUE?

120
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,439
Welcome.

121
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:27,530
Oh, thank you.

122
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:34,120
-Trying to pick a fight with me?
-Young-ki.

123
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:36,330
That's up to you.

124
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:37,498
Whoa, scary.

125
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,794
You don't want me hitting on Mi-ran?

126
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:44,839
-No.
-You said you two are done.

127
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:47,258
Mi-ran wasn't scouted by our firm.

128
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:49,051
She applied here herself.

129
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,637
She chose our firm,
and she chose this moment.

130
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:53,931
That's who she is.

131
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:56,267
No calls, no talks of reunion, just bam!

132
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,727
She charges in first.

133
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:01,481
I thought I was over her.
But when my pants ripped, I realized.

134
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:03,566
I didn't care about anyone else,

135
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,067
but to show that to Mi-ran…

136
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:07,653
Why did I have to wear pink that day?

137
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:08,905
YEO MI-RAN

138
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:13,451
Yes, Mi-ran.

139
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:15,953
Jin-suh, let me ask you something.

140
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,039
Who takes care of Nam Kang-ho?

141
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:19,707
What? That's me.

142
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,542
Oh, is it?

143
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:27,006
Then, do you think
you can let me work for him with you?

144
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:28,966
Why?

145
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,136
Well, isn't it obvious? I have feelings.

146
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:37,391
I think we should give each other
some time.

147
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:40,019
No, I didn't mean I'm interested
in working with you--

148
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,187
I'll think about it.

149
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,605
-What?
-Bye.

150
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:49,111
-She wants to get back with you?
-Basically, yeah.

151
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,947
After she saw your pants rip?

152
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:52,657
Hey, no.

153
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,825
She must feel sorry for you.

154
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:56,536
Jeez, what are you going to do?

155
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,329
There's more where that came from.

156
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:02,208
She'll see you running errands
for Choi Soo-jin and Nam Kang-ho.

157
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,544
No. Not for Choi Soo-jin anymore.

158
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:07,380
Now you're just talking to yourself.

159
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,049
Man, this girl is so…

160
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,218
YOON SANG-SUP

161
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:14,845
Sang-sup?

162
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:18,432
I'm having a drink
with an important client--

163
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:19,892
Okay.

164
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,354
-Damn it.
-Are you called out?

165
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,898
I have a headache.

166
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:29,235
Jeez, do they think
we are on standby 24/7?

167
00:09:29,318 --> 00:09:30,152
Young-ki.

168
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:34,240
I'm sorry, but can you go instead today?

169
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,245
-"No."
-Come on.

170
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,330
I have no choice, then.

171
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:45,668
I'll have to call someone
who would do anything I ask.

172
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:49,088
God, that was so stupid.

173
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:51,591
Asking my ex for a favor
because I'm into another guy?

174
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,426
I practically slapped him in the face.

175
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,099
Hello?

176
00:10:00,182 --> 00:10:02,184
Can you go to Nam Kang-ho in my place?

177
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:04,395
You mean, right now?

178
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,608
Does that mean
I can work for him with you?

179
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:12,612
I'll send his manager's contact info
and the address. Call him on your way.

180
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,113
-Thanks.
-Okay.

181
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,743
Wow, she's so…

182
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:22,872
You ran into her at a hotel.
And she still wants to try dating again?

183
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,540
She's that kind of girl.

184
00:10:27,543 --> 00:10:30,379
Look at it.
Kang-ho's not in any of the pictures!

185
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:33,716
I don't care.
I'm saying this as the club president--

186
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,009
Club president, my ass!

187
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:36,093
Oh man.

188
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:39,472
What is wrong with them, seriously?

189
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,682
-What's up?
-Sir.

190
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,851
Things are getting more and more serious.

191
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:45,227
Should we call the cops?

192
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:47,480
Call the cops?

193
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:49,940
Then this will become a big fat headline.

194
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:52,943
-Where's Attorney Lee?
-He said he'd be here soon.

195
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:56,947
We should remove Ip-sae as club president.

196
00:10:57,031 --> 00:10:59,283
She's going to ruin Kang-ho's series!

197
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,451
Leave her be.

198
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:03,287
We can handle her
because she loves Kang-ho.

199
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,039
If she starts hating him, we can't.

200
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:08,959
Hey, don't even think
about breaking them up, okay?

201
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:10,378
-Okay.
-Just keep watching.

202
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:11,504
Okay.

203
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:17,051
-What is it? Is something wrong?
-No, it's fine.

204
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:18,719
It will get worse if they see you.

205
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,601
-What happened?
-What was that?

206
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,603
Hey, get up!

207
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:53,587
-What the hell?
-Is she crazy?

208
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,214
-What is that?
-Isn't that a toy?

209
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:56,424
Hey!

210
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,676
Don't panic. It's just a toy.

211
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,137
Now, who am I?

212
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:02,722
A lawyer.

213
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,765
-Lawyer?
-Lawyer.

214
00:12:04,849 --> 00:12:06,434
-What is she doing here?
-Yeah.

215
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:07,935
Why is she here?

216
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:10,521
-You don't know?
-What's up with her, Sang-sup?

217
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:15,401
I don't know either.
I called Mr. Lee Jin-suh.

218
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:18,821
Does anyone know the fine
for public disturbance?

219
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:22,533
It's 50,000 won.

220
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,495
If anyone comes at me,
I'll sue for assault.

221
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:28,706
We didn't mean to hit--

222
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:31,834
But if you assault someone so hard
that it leads to injury,

223
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:35,588
things will get very serious.

224
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:38,466
You don't know the difference
between assault and injury? Man!

225
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:41,594
Oh, Mr. Do!
The director's looking for you.

226
00:12:41,677 --> 00:12:42,970
-Is she?
-Yes.

227
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:44,388
-Sang-sup.
-Yes.

228
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,891
Keep an eye on them.
Call me if anything happens.

229
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:47,892
Yes, sir.

230
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,311
-This way.
-Hey.

231
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:51,228
Bye.

232
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:54,523
That was the legal stuff.

233
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:58,360
Now, I'm about to say something
very personal.

234
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:02,323
I'm going to be blunt about it,
so please leave if that will upset you.

235
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:05,075
Go on. Start talking.

236
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:09,872
Now, raise your hand if you've been
to these meetings less than three times.

237
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,584
You can come once or twice
if you're a fan.

238
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:16,295
Three or more, less than ten. Hand up.

239
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:21,425
That's a lot. Okay.

240
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,636
I guess you can call it a pastime.

241
00:13:23,719 --> 00:13:24,720
Ten or more.

242
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,806
Those who follow him to every appearance.

243
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,018
You, stalker.

244
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:32,436
You, you, stalker.

245
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,979
-What?
-"Stalker"?

246
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,023
Do people like stalkers?

247
00:13:36,106 --> 00:13:38,526
-No.
-Hey, did you say stalker?

248
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:40,569
Are lawyers allowed to talk trash?

249
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,571
Yeah! You don't know anything!

250
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:43,823
Kids!

251
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:46,158
A fact about men.

252
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:49,328
They care about women
who can dump them anytime,

253
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:52,623
but they don't care about women
who can't live without them!

254
00:13:53,749 --> 00:13:54,750
Write that down.

255
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,086
Write those words in your heart!

256
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:00,840
Someday, you'll remember these words.

257
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,427
-Try this.
-Oh, thank you.

258
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,012
This too. It's a crab shell.

259
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:09,306
You have to work hard from now on,
so eat up.

260
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:13,435
Jeez, you're drinking too much again.
No, stop it.

261
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,771
Kang-ho, let me pour you a glass.

262
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,030
I'm learning a lot from you.

263
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:28,659
You were very smooth in the interview too.

264
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:31,662
Actually, I'm a very honest girl,

265
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:33,747
so I can't keep a poker face.

266
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:38,878
It's good that you're honest,

267
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,796
but don't be a nuisance.

268
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,104
Yeah, how did it go?

269
00:14:57,187 --> 00:14:59,064
-They are all gone now.
-Okay.

270
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:00,566
-You haven't eaten, right?
-No.

271
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,067
Come in and have dinner.

272
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:05,988
But the lawyer is waiting here
to say hi to Kang-ho.

273
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,282
What? Why?

274
00:15:08,866 --> 00:15:12,036
She will be working for Kang-ho
along with Mr. Lee.

275
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:13,704
What did you say?

276
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:21,837
Hello.

277
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,088
Yeah, hi.

278
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,135
-Sang-sup. You haven't eaten, right?
-No.

279
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:29,803
Go eat. You must be hungry.

280
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:31,430
Okay.

281
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,308
We've met before.

282
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:37,811
I'm Yeo Mi-ran, and I'll be working
for Mr. Nam Kang-ho starting today.

283
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:39,605
Okay.

284
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:43,192
Thank you for taking care of
today's incident,

285
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:46,737
but I didn't get any calls about this.

286
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,655
Oh.

287
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:50,866
It was decided a few hours ago
when I talked to Lee Jin-suh.

288
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,034
Who decided?

289
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,371
Sorry?

290
00:15:55,454 --> 00:16:00,876
Did you, by any chance, plan this,
hoping you'd get close to me?

291
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,920
-Sorry?
-What?

292
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:04,922
She likes me.

293
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:07,883
She told me at the party.

294
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:11,011
That's why she tripped me.

295
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,599
That time I fell to the floor. It was her.

296
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:16,934
What?

297
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,896
I'm so sorry!

298
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,482
Hey, hold it there.
What are you talking about?

299
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:26,235
You tripped him on purpose?

300
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,154
I didn't mean to hurt him or anything.

301
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:32,950
Forget it. She already apologized.
What is your intention behind this?

302
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:35,995
I was so sorry for that day.

303
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:39,248
So I want to do my best
to help you with anything.

304
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:42,418
There are no other intentions whatsoever!

305
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:43,836
-I swear!
-Oh God!

306
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:46,839
I have another reason.
One you couldn't begin to imagine.

307
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:48,716
What is this dangerous thing?

308
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:50,759
Oh, this?

309
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,053
It won't hurt. It's very soft.

310
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:55,723
I can throw it accurately
so it doesn't hit anyone.

311
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:57,349
Oh God!

312
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,437
I'm more athletic than the average person.

313
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,399
If a fight breaks out,
I can even be your bodyguard!

314
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,234
Want to see?

315
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:12,531
Watch.

316
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:35,304
What are you doing?
You're killing him, not guarding him!

317
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:38,599
Wait. You're a very interesting person.

318
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:42,853
But just because you can pose
doesn't mean you can fight.

319
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:45,731
What are you going to do
if a stronger person grabs your--

320
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:52,613
What the hell are you doing?

321
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:55,282
Hey, you have problems, seriously!

322
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:57,451
Oh, I'm so sorry!

323
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,370
I must be out of my mind!

324
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,751
Anyway, thank you again
for taking care of things today.

325
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:09,213
Kang-ho is actually uncomfortable
with female lawyers.

326
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:10,714
Thank you again.

327
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,299
Goodbye. Let's go.

328
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:16,512
-Let's go. Come on!
-Huh?

329
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:20,599
Ouch.

330
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:27,189
But he could've said I'm the problem.
What's wrong with female lawyers?

331
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:28,857
Damn it.

332
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,695
Don't you think
there's something wrong with her?

333
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,117
I'm dizzy.

334
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:39,952
Was that mixed martial arts?

335
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:43,539
It seemed like it was,
but I'm not sure what kind.

336
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,290
What are you on about?

337
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:46,208
Hey.

338
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,169
I think she's a really weird woman.

339
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,046
First, she humiliates you.

340
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,465
Then she helps you
and tries to cling to you.

341
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,385
You should watch out.

342
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,555
I always watch out for women.

343
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:09,940
Why isn't she answering?
What are they doing together?

344
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:14,820
YEO MI-RAN

345
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:18,615
Hello. Shit.

346
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:19,783
-Hello?
-It's me.

347
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:22,035
-Why won't you pick up--
-I'm done here.

348
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:24,454
How did it go? Did you take care of it?

349
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:25,372
Yeah.

350
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,168
Of course. It was nothing.

351
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:31,503
I knew it. You don't need me.

352
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,422
You don't need my help.

353
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:36,800
What kind of girl doesn't ask
to get dropped off

354
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,969
or call to get picked up?

355
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:41,722
You should stop drinking. Get home safe.

356
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:43,515
What? Hello?

357
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:50,022
Hello? Shit.

358
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:54,693
Who is it?

359
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:57,571
-Give it!
-Look at you.

360
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,115
Look at you. You like her more.

361
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:03,911
Yeah, I like her.
You don't know what love is.

362
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:06,663
Hey! It would have been okay
if it was anyone else.

363
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:09,082
But you ran into her at a hotel!

364
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:10,500
How can you date her again?

365
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:11,919
I don't know.

366
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:14,963
She's very good at messing up a man.

367
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,341
Once you get hooked on Mi-ran,

368
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,385
it's not easy to escape.

369
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:24,431
She scores 500 with her right hand
and 200 with her left in four-ball carom.

370
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,476
Good at all kinds of tricks.

371
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,938
Good at all kinds of sports.

372
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,439
And she has no fear.

373
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:38,570
Badass!

374
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:40,447
Hop on.

375
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:45,744
I have to get into a tiger cave
if I'm to catch a tiger.

376
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:50,123
You did well today.

377
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,503
It's okay. I can go by myself from here.

378
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:56,088
Thank you. Great job today.

379
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:57,839
-Goodbye. Good job today.
-Bye.

380
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,049
Thank you!

381
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:00,425
-Thank you!
-Mr. Do.

382
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:02,678
-Yeah?
-I want a word with you.

383
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:06,932
I think you're drunk again.
Let's talk next time when you're sober.

384
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:10,102
I really need to tell you something!

385
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:11,687
I'll be quick. Just this once!

386
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,109
-You should go first.
-Okay.

387
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:19,528
-Goodbye.
-Where are we going?

388
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:23,907
Kang-ho.

389
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:27,494
I'm sorry,
but I need to go get some medicine.

390
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:29,454
-What's wrong?
-I'm not sure.

391
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,540
My stomach is a bit upset.

392
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,960
I told you to slow down.
You were eating too fast.

393
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:36,295
-Come here.
-Sorry?

394
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:39,965
No fever.

395
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,594
-You should go home and rest.
-What?

396
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:45,595
No, it's okay.

397
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,307
-I need to drive you home--
-No, I can call for a driver.

398
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:49,808
But still, I--

399
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:51,184
Go home quickly.

400
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:54,438
-Should I call you a cab?
-No. I'd feel too bad--

401
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,523
Come on, you're sick. Don't feel bad.

402
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:58,817
Get some rest,
and let me know if you're okay.

403
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,735
Okay.

404
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:02,279
-Thanks.
-Go on.

405
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:04,990
-Have a safe trip home.
-Yeah.

406
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:13,749
-Driver!
-Oh God.

407
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,334
Can I be your driver?

408
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:17,252
-You're still here?
-Yes!

409
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:20,797
I was hungry,
so I had dinner somewhere near here.

410
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:23,050
I just came out, and here you are.

411
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:27,304
I might seem like a stalker.

412
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:30,098
Well…

413
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:34,436
I really feel sorry
about tripping you that day.

414
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:35,979
And to show you that I am,

415
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:37,272
I'd like to help you.

416
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,107
I love driving.

417
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,485
I have a Category C1 license.

418
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:44,154
If you can't decide
whether turning me down

419
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:46,990
or letting me drive for you is ruder,

420
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:50,827
I'd say that, from my perspective,
it's more tragic to be turned down.

421
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:52,079
This is bad.

422
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:54,539
If I lose him this time,
I can't approach him again.

423
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:59,419
Is it really a Category C1 license?

424
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:01,630
Of course!

425
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,257
Why would I lie
about something so trivial?

426
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:15,977
CATEGORY C1 STANDARD

427
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,859
-Then give it a try.
-Okay!

428
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:27,614
I'll drive you home safely.

429
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:31,576
That day was really rough,

430
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:34,121
and I think I made a fool of myself.
I'm sorry.

431
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:35,705
No, you didn't.

432
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:37,874
You're still very young,

433
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,209
so I totally understand.

434
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:41,837
Well, I thought you would hate me.

435
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,255
Oh, jeez.

436
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:45,132
I don't hate you.

437
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:46,425
-Look here.
-Yes?

438
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:51,221
If you only cut down on your drinking,

439
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:54,641
I think you'll become
an amazing director in the future.

440
00:23:58,145 --> 00:23:58,979
Really?

441
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:04,192
What makes you think
I'll become a great director someday?

442
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:08,738
I expected this to happen,
so I brought these.

443
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:10,615
Ta-da!

444
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:17,831
One for you, and one for me.

445
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,667
Cheers!

446
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:26,673
Why do you think
I'll become an amazing director?

447
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:28,925
Please tell me.

448
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,826
He's not going to make me drive

449
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,829
and still turn me down
because I'm a female lawyer, is he?

450
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,498
That's possible.

451
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:00,415
Shit.

452
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:02,209
Did you learn martial arts?

453
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:04,628
Yes, a little bit.

454
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:06,171
-Which one?
-This and that.

455
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:10,008
Taekwondo to Judo, Aikido, Kung Fu.

456
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:14,012
-Boxing and MMA too.
-How many black belts do you have?

457
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:16,431
I only trained briefly in each,
so I have no black belts.

458
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,102
But why did you learn so many?

459
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:23,438
They were hobbies. I just enjoyed them.

460
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:26,858
What did you enjoy? Fighting?

461
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:29,945
Winning a fight.

462
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,869
Turn right at the second alley.

463
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:40,455
-What?
-I'm going to the convenience store.

464
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:43,333
Oh, okay.

465
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:45,919
If there's so much as a scratch…

466
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,956
Where's the store?

467
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,083
Take a left at the end of the road.

468
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,349
What do you think? Can you get past this?

469
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,319
Hey, slow down!

470
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:10,629
We're here!

471
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:12,255
Ending directions.

472
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:13,340
Hey, wait.

473
00:27:14,049 --> 00:27:16,551
-How did you know that's my house?
-What?

474
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,054
The GPS told us.

475
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:22,015
No, how did you know
which house I live in?

476
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:24,017
It could be that house or that house.

477
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,477
You watched me drive!

478
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,521
I have great depth perception
and spatial awareness.

479
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:32,442
Here you go.

480
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:40,575
-I'll get going now.
-Oh, yes. Thank you.

481
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:41,701
I'll call you a cab.

482
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:43,453
That's okay.

483
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:45,580
I insist. Take the cab.

484
00:27:46,164 --> 00:27:48,792
Did I drive him for nothing?

485
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:50,502
It will arrive in three minutes.

486
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:52,837
Oh, I'm really fine.

487
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:55,465
I'll catch one on the main street.
Goodbye.

488
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:57,300
Excuse me.

489
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,139
-Yes?
-I called it already.

490
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:04,766
Oh, right.

491
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:15,151
You don't have to wait with me.

492
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:19,698
You can take care of my cases from now on.

493
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:20,782
Okay.

494
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:22,784
What?

495
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:27,330
I'd feel bad sending you off
while owing you if you weren't my lawyer.

496
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,374
Thank you!

497
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:30,458
I'll do my best!

498
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,420
You can reach out whenever you need me.

499
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:36,381
You already gave this to my agent earlier.

500
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:38,258
Oh, I did!

501
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:40,427
-Oops!
-Congratulations.

502
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,638
-You're a successful fan.
-Sure.

503
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:46,558
Yeah. Such an honor, Your Majesty.

504
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:48,601
It's not a blessing to work for you.

505
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,520
You may have succeeded once,

506
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:53,273
but don't expect to succeed
in something else too.

507
00:28:53,356 --> 00:28:54,190
What?

508
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:56,067
I'm telling you not to like me so much.

509
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:58,111
You might get your heart broken.

510
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,739
Oh, so cocky!

511
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:04,325
I would never dream of that!

512
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,161
I wouldn't dare!

513
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:09,831
I bet you have a girlfriend
who is very young and pretty!

514
00:29:11,916 --> 00:29:13,042
It's here.

515
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:18,673
-Have a good night.
-Okay.

516
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,099
What was that?

517
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:31,895
She's a new kind.

518
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:38,860
You're now driving to your death,
and I'm going to live!

519
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:42,697
-What?
-No, it's about something else.

520
00:29:46,242 --> 00:29:47,619
Oh God!

521
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:50,079
You said you came here to drink.

522
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:51,831
Are you asleep?

523
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:58,963
I think your sofa is so comfy.

524
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:03,885
Who's the girl
that bothered you this time?

525
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:05,845
It's not like that.

526
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:08,389
No matter what she does,

527
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:09,808
Do Won-jun never gives in.

528
00:30:09,891 --> 00:30:14,270
Even a pretty, smart,
rich girl like me can't seduce you.

529
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:16,898
What did you say? Huh?

530
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:20,860
If we're living like this when we're 40,

531
00:30:20,944 --> 00:30:22,111
shall we get married?

532
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:32,580
Grace, you never get tired.

533
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:36,000
You're so energetic, even at this hour.

534
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,669
I have a good reason for that.

535
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:41,506
-I just met director Yoo Sung-jun.
-Yoo Sung-jun?

536
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,801
-Are you producing his film?
-Yeah.

537
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:47,095
-What about the male lead?
-Undecided.

538
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:48,429
The script just came out.

539
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:51,140
Hey.

540
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:56,563
Kang-ho really wants to shoot
an action-noir movie.

541
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,899
If it's Yoo Sung-jun's film,
we have to do it!

542
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,442
Jeez.

543
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:10,285
Here.

544
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:11,953
Read it, and call me.

545
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:14,122
Can I give this to Kang-ho?

546
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:15,415
Yes.

547
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:18,877
Grace, thank you so much.

548
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:21,212
Jeez.

549
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:25,341
I'd love it if you liked me
as much as you like Kang-ho.

550
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:35,685
One, two, three, four. Okay!

551
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:41,983
Okay!

552
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:42,901
Yeo.

553
00:31:43,526 --> 00:31:45,862
You should always update
your party repertoire.

554
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:46,779
Yes, sir.

555
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:51,659
-Hey, let's have the meeting first.
-Yes, sir.

556
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,494
Lee Jin-suh! Yeo Mi-ran!

557
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:56,998
Who gave you permission
to represent Nam Kang-ho together?

558
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:04,464
Sorry, sir. I had an emergency,
so I asked Yeo to go in my place, and--

559
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:06,758
Nam Kang-ho said he was okay with it.

560
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:09,260
That's what I'm saying.

561
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:12,055
-How did you seduce him?
-What?

562
00:32:12,138 --> 00:32:15,642
Frankly, he's not the type
to get along with women.

563
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:19,854
Actually, I drove for him.

564
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,606
Because his manager got sick.

565
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:23,232
Wow! To his house?

566
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:25,151
-Perfect timing.
-Is that all you did?

567
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:28,321
Of course that's all. You be quiet.

568
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:29,739
You did great.

569
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:31,366
You're the best.

570
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:35,620
Hey, I told you to watch out for her.

571
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:38,039
Don't worry. You know me.

572
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:39,707
I'll put her back in her place.

573
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:44,295
"You might be one
of the prettiest lawyers in your town,

574
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:46,673
but I'm surrounded by girls like you."

575
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:49,634
"Give up on seducing a top star
to turn your life around,

576
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:51,302
and work hard to earn a living."

577
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:53,054
I'll be teaching that to her.

578
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:55,932
Do you have to?

579
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:58,935
Isn't it better to remain as strangers?
Are you interested in her?

580
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,188
Not at all.

581
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:04,023
Why are you here so early?

582
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:04,941
Is something up?

583
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:10,363
Here.

584
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:11,364
What is that?

585
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:14,117
Director Yoo Sung-jun's script.

586
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:15,493
Yoo Sung-jun?

587
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:19,831
I said I'd read it first and then call--

588
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:21,916
Are you crazy? Tell him I'm in!

589
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,543
Tell him it's an amazing movie!

590
00:33:23,626 --> 00:33:26,462
Tell him that
Nam Kang-ho is dying to meet him!

591
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:27,755
Okay.

592
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:29,340
-Won-jun.
-Yeah.

593
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:30,758
I love you. Do you know that?

594
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:31,926
-Do you?
-Okay.

595
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,012
Don't. Don't do it!

596
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:37,640
I love you!

597
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:40,059
I thought you were done with romance!

598
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:41,769
This isn't romance. It's erotica.

599
00:33:43,771 --> 00:33:44,939
You crazy bastard!

600
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:47,650
-What's wrong?
-I said stop!

601
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:48,901
What are you doing?

602
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:51,529
Why are you so damn strong?

603
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:53,781
Attorney Yeo.

604
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:55,491
Yeah.

605
00:33:55,575 --> 00:33:57,201
These are Nam Kang-ho's case files.

606
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:58,411
Most are women-related.

607
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,705
This is a lot of files.

608
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:02,623
Is he the baddest playboy, after all?

609
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,000
Not even.

610
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:05,752
He fights with all the actresses.

611
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:08,546
Our job is to cover up the scandals
caused by their feuds.

612
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:11,382
He's an odd one.

613
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:12,633
He never dates anyone.

614
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,053
I think he hates women.

615
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:19,348
-He hates women?
-Yeah.

616
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:24,979
Not sure about that.

617
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,774
-Maybe he hates adult women.
-What?

618
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:29,609
Oh, nothing.

619
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:34,489
Wow, you took Dowon's two top stars
as soon as you arrived.

620
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,157
Nam Kang-ho. Choi Soo-jin.

621
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:41,662
Yeah, you stuck your neck out
as soon as you arrived. Poor you!

622
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:45,374
Huh?

623
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:48,044
You got the two stars.
Why is that sticking your neck out?

624
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:51,547
It means they give you a lot of work
and cause a lot of trouble.

625
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:53,758
Choi Soo-jin fired Jin-suh, you know.

626
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:56,427
And Nam Kang-ho called his lawyer
over a fan club fight.

627
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:59,514
They both think
that lawyers are their gofers.

628
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:02,725
Jin-suh was such a show-off,
but I guess he suffers a lot.

629
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:05,728
He's a bit miserable in the office.

630
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:08,147
He's working his tail off.
He even ripped his pants.

631
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:11,734
-He ripped his pants? Why?
-To make people laugh.

632
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:14,695
He was spreading his legs open,
and the middle went rip!

633
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:18,241
-Rip!
-Pink panties!

634
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:52,608
Sang-sup.

635
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:56,654
Am I giving you a hard time?

636
00:35:58,114 --> 00:35:59,157
What?

637
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,241
No, you're not.

638
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:01,659
You said no.

639
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,911
-I trust you.
-Okay.

640
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,580
Don't get sick to your stomach.

641
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,790
I'll get sick too.

642
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:12,295
Were you rehearsing just now?

643
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:15,506
Why, was it too cheesy?
Enough to make you sick again?

644
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,925
I haven't seen you so happy in a while.

645
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:19,719
It makes me feel good.

646
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:21,304
Hey, kid.

647
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:23,806
Love you.

648
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:37,028
Mr. Nam. Welcome.

649
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:40,865
It was Kang-ho's dream
to work with you, Director Yoo.

650
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:42,783
He used to say it all the time.

651
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,368
Now we meet at last.

652
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:53,419
Sir.

653
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:56,255
As always, your script is…

654
00:36:57,715 --> 00:36:59,800
Thank you. I'll give my all.

655
00:37:04,889 --> 00:37:05,723
May I ask

656
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:09,018
if you have decided on the female lead?

657
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:15,942
No. We've considered some candidates,

658
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:18,027
but Director Yoo hasn't made up
his mind yet.

659
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:32,959
He wants to know if there's anyone
you feel uncomfortable working with.

660
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:34,168
What?

661
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,420
-Oh, I'm not sure--
-No.

662
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:37,672
There's no one.

663
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:43,427
Yes, no one.

664
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:47,932
Kang-ho is a good actor,
but after reading the script,

665
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:51,185
I think he has to work
on his action scenes before the shoot.

666
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:54,021
Have you decided
on the martial arts director?

667
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,651
Director Yoo Hyun-sang.

668
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:04,657
Wow, sir, I'm so excited!

669
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:22,758
How is it?

670
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:24,635
Jeez, this is a problem.

671
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:27,054
-What is?
-You're athletic.

672
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:30,057
But your moves are too sporty.

673
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:32,893
What the director wants
is more of a backstreet punk.

674
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:35,271
I can do punk if you want.

675
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:36,981
-Do it.
-What?

676
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,912
That's not it. Hey.

677
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:53,164
Oh, I'm dizzy.

678
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:54,332
-Try it this way.
-What?

679
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:02,006
Move lightly. Just relax.

680
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:13,559
It won't be easy to shake off your habits.

681
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,936
What do you mean by "sporty"?

682
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,606
You learned to fight not for fighting
but just for fitness.

683
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:28,991
Parents, an older brother.
A Seoul National University dropout.

684
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:30,326
Blood type, B.

685
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,372
"Know your enemy and know yourself."

686
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:36,123
But there's nothing on him.

687
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:39,377
He doesn't get along with actresses,
but the staff loves him.

688
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:44,590
He's like a "Mr. Righteous,"
who punishes actresses on power trips?

689
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:46,967
Mr. Righteous, my ass.

690
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:54,308
If she had been in her uniform,
I could've found out about her school.

691
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:57,728
Stakeout.

692
00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,647
This is the only way.

693
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:20,835
God, when is he coming?

694
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,505
Who is this?

695
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:26,590
Hello?

696
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:28,092
Hello, I'm Nam Kang-ho.

697
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:30,261
Oh, yes!

698
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:33,264
Where are you?

699
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:37,017
Why do you ask?

700
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:39,937
I have something to ask you,
but I can't do it over the phone.

701
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:42,898
-Can I see you for a moment?
-Right now?

702
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:44,442
If you're home, I'll go there.

703
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:46,068
No!

704
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:49,405
Oh, well. I'm out right now.

705
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:52,408
Come to think of it,
I'm actually close to your house.

706
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:53,909
You're near my house?

707
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:59,248
No, I'm not near it,
but I'm five minutes away by taxi.

708
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:01,750
Should we meet at my place?

709
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,461
If you don't mind.

710
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:05,254
Okay, I'll call you when I get there.

711
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:15,181
Man, how can I describe the feeling?

712
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,849
You know the kind.

713
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:19,977
It's like you taught yourself to fight
on the streets.

714
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:24,148
Like a mishmash of styles?

715
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:27,026
Was that what it was?

716
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:35,993
How can a woman give off such a vibe?

717
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:41,415
"Can't talk over the phone at this hour."

718
00:41:41,499 --> 00:41:42,333
"Let's meet."

719
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,001
"At my house!"

720
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:47,213
He's hitting on me for sure!

721
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:51,050
He must think I'm easy
because I said I liked him.

722
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:54,720
On top of that,
I'm bound by confidentiality,

723
00:41:55,429 --> 00:41:58,098
so he can play around with me
without getting into trouble.

724
00:41:58,682 --> 00:41:59,517
In that case,

725
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,811
how about I make it easier
for him to hit on me?

726
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:09,360
NEW RECORDING

727
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:12,446
You picked the wrong girl this time.

728
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,119
You got here first.

729
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:22,331
Yeah, I told you

730
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:25,834
that I happened to be close by.

731
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:29,088
And I happen to be drunk.

732
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:31,340
What do you say? Getting horny?

733
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:35,302
-Are you drunk?
-What?

734
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:39,139
Then let's talk another time.

735
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:40,933
Get in. I'll take you home.

736
00:42:42,768 --> 00:42:43,686
Wait!

737
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:47,356
I'm not drunk.

738
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:50,734
I dozed off a bit while waiting for you.

739
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:52,653
I didn't drink at all.

740
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:13,465
Follow me.

741
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:15,467
What is it you want to do with me?

742
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:17,720
This way.

743
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:23,601
You can sit here.

744
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:32,818
I suddenly asked to meet you
because I'm not a patient guy.

745
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:36,280
Do you know Yoo Sung-jun?
The master of action-noir.

746
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:38,616
Yes, I do.

747
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:40,284
I will be working on his film.

748
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:43,162
This might sound absurd,

749
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:46,498
but when I think about the action scenes,
you keep coming to my mind.

750
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:48,334
You said you're a good fighter.

751
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:50,461
Yes, I am good.

752
00:43:50,544 --> 00:43:52,004
Who taught you?

753
00:43:52,087 --> 00:43:53,756
As I told you before,

754
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:55,591
I learned this and that,

755
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,469
but I taught myself how to fight.

756
00:43:58,552 --> 00:44:00,471
Right. So, it's not
from a particular style?

757
00:44:00,554 --> 00:44:02,473
No. I do whatever I want.

758
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:03,641
Can I see it again?

759
00:44:06,727 --> 00:44:07,978
-Now?
-Oh.

760
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:11,857
I want to see
if it feels the same as I remember it.

761
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:14,568
So, did you call me here to see that?

762
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:15,819
Yes.

763
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:20,199
Is he a nutjob?
Is this how a nutjob hits on a girl?

764
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:25,371
I will pay you a consultation fee
for coming here today.

765
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:28,207
Well,

766
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:32,419
I didn't have a specific pose in mind.

767
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:48,227
You get hurt if you don't warm up.

768
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:51,522
Here goes.

769
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,859
Side!

770
00:44:56,568 --> 00:44:59,071
Slap, chop!

771
00:44:59,154 --> 00:45:00,280
Eyeballs!

772
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:01,740
Balls!

773
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:09,039
I need a partner for this.

774
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:12,084
It feels a bit weird to do it in the air.

775
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:16,839
Try it on me, then.

776
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:28,559
No, I don't attack those who stay still.

777
00:45:29,268 --> 00:45:30,144
Attack me.

778
00:45:42,656 --> 00:45:43,991
Are you playing with me?

779
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:50,205
Here I go.

780
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:52,708
You don't say "here I go" when you fight.

781
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:53,625
Just come.

782
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:20,527
Are you okay?

783
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:22,446
I'm sorry!

784
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,618
Do you not like me anymore?

785
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:29,953
What?

786
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:39,004
Don't you like me anymore?
