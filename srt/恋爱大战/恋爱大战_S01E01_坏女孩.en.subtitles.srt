1
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,475
Hello? Get a grip, okay?

2
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:00,977
Wake up.

3
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:04,814
You have to go home, don't you?

4
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:07,776
Thief!

5
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:09,360
Somebody help--

6
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:13,156
Yeah, you should go home alive, right?

7
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:22,832
What the…

8
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,834
What a crazy bitch.

9
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,213
Hey, just go. Piss off.

10
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:29,172
I said piss off!

11
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,926
Damn it! Why you little…

12
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,647
I'm sorry!

13
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:54,280
Please forgive me…

14
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:06,376
LOVE TO HATE YOU

15
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:16,427
A BRAVE CIVILIAN? OR AN ASSAILANT?

16
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:24,727
Excuse me.

17
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:29,399
The injured culprit is now hospitalized
and will take six weeks to recover.

18
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,985
She saved my life.
Don't call her an assailant.

19
00:02:32,068 --> 00:02:33,736
But was it really a woman?

20
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,738
No way. It was a guy, right?

21
00:02:38,408 --> 00:02:39,909
Hey, how was your trip?

22
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,661
Do you have a death wish?

23
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:43,413
I told you to call the police!

24
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:46,249
Do you wander around
searching for a man to beat up?

25
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:48,668
How did you know?
Even my mom didn't recognize me.

26
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:50,336
Are you a full-time girl gangster?

27
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,172
-Law must be your side gig!
-Hey!

28
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:53,923
Why are you saying "girl gangster"?

29
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,216
Does gangster imply a man?

30
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,594
Thanks for worrying about me.
I'll call you later.

31
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:58,511
Hey!

32
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:06,019
How could you possibly take the call?

33
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:08,104
It could have been an urgent call.

34
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,190
I take them even when I'm doing it.

35
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:16,988
What's wrong?

36
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:19,949
It bothers me how certain you are
that this is a one-night stand.

37
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,826
Who knows if we will end up dating?

38
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:24,537
At least give me hope
that this might be our first time

39
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:25,580
to get me in the mood.

40
00:03:25,663 --> 00:03:27,332
Wow!

41
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:29,959
We talked for two hours,
and I didn't know.

42
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,252
You're quite the romantic.

43
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:32,545
And open-minded too.

44
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,589
Men always sleep around

45
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:38,092
but never think of dating
the women they hook up with.

46
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:51,648
One-night stand, type one.

47
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:52,732
I'll take a shower first.

48
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:55,235
Men who have always wanted
to try a one-night stand.

49
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:58,613
They don't care
about who they're sleeping with.

50
00:03:59,781 --> 00:04:01,366
I'd like to drink alone.

51
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:04,911
Then you should be at home,
not at a bar, baby.

52
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:06,204
What's with the "baby"?

53
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:07,956
Just trying to get close to you.

54
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,960
Type two, men who think about sex all day.

55
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:14,504
-What?
-I enjoy sex myself.

56
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:16,965
But when guys act too easy,
it's just not appealing.

57
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:19,425
One-night stand, type three.

58
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:22,679
Hello! Let's act on our feelings tonight.

59
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:23,846
No names or ages.

60
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,518
You're married, aren't you?

61
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:29,477
How did you know?

62
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,021
-They're either married… or dating.
-Divorced.

63
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:34,732
Now here's a new type.

64
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:37,151
A romantic type
who dreams of Before Sunrise.

65
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:39,946
This is new.

66
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:43,449
How about we get some drinks
and come back here?

67
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,910
-I thought I killed the mood.
-You did earlier.

68
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,453
But to say goodbye like this…

69
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:50,665
I don't like you
going back and forth, but…

70
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,418
-Sure!
-Sure!

71
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:56,254
You're really easygoing, so chill.

72
00:04:58,798 --> 00:04:59,924
Babe?

73
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:09,267
I don't have to feel sorry, do I?

74
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,435
We just met today.

75
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:13,604
You met today? You came here with--

76
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:16,107
What's going on here?

77
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,066
Who is she?

78
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:19,944
You must've dated for a while, baby.

79
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:22,280
I've known Jin-suh for eight years now.

80
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:23,740
And we've been dating for…

81
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,241
Is it six months?

82
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,200
-Is that true?
-Hey.

83
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:28,536
You aren't chill. You're just nuts.

84
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,997
Take care, and lighten up!

85
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,498
Son of a bitch!

86
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:33,791
Um, I…

87
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,002
Don't ever show your face again.

88
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:37,962
Babe… I mean Ji-yeong!

89
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,508
We ran into each other on a narrow bridge,

90
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,302
and now you got yourself an enemy.

91
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:47,096
Dating for six months?

92
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,932
You call this dating?
You've been sleeping around like this.

93
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,268
That's not for you to say.

94
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,604
-It's tit-for-tat anyway.
-What?

95
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:56,606
We're over and done with. Bye.

96
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:01,861
This isn't tit-for-tat.
You were done, but I was starting.

97
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:04,822
You got laid, but I didn't!

98
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:20,546
Did you drive here?

99
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,634
It's dangerous to drive when you're mad.

100
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:26,844
I just want you to get home safely.

101
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:29,430
-Did you know he was cheating?
-Kind of.

102
00:06:29,514 --> 00:06:32,308
Did he not put his phone face down
when he was with you?

103
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,521
Then why didn't you dump him?

104
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:37,897
Just because Everland is fun

105
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,400
doesn't mean you throw away
Lotte World's annual pass.

106
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:41,609
That's just it!

107
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:43,528
Men do the same thing too.

108
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:46,072
If they are capable men,
there is no question about it.

109
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:48,741
The Best Actor Award goes to Nam Kang-ho!

110
00:06:48,825 --> 00:06:52,286
Mr. Nam Kang-ho
is already described by many names.

111
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,288
Master of Kisses, God of Romance.

112
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:56,624
Now he will also be called
the National Star.

113
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:59,210
Oh, I should say "international"

114
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:01,963
since he's recently participated
in a Hollywood film.

115
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:04,549
We have a lot of his fans
from overseas here.

116
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:06,300
BEST ACTOR - NAM KANG-HO

117
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:11,722
Now, please go ahead and give your speech.

118
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:15,059
Yes, thank you very much.

119
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:18,896
I always used to say
that it's an honor just to be nominated,

120
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:22,024
but I really wanted to win this award
at least once.

121
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,116
I love acting, and I've worked hard.

122
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:33,327
And I am deeply indebted
to the wonderful people around me.

123
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:34,996
I'd like to mention them all,

124
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,457
but I don't think I can.

125
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,627
Instead, I will text
each and every one of you.

126
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:44,755
And I'd like to share this honor
with my soulmate,

127
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:48,217
the lifelong benefactor, Mr. Do Won-jun.

128
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,052
As long as you give me a chance,

129
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,762
I will live and die as an actor.

130
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:52,972
Thank you!

131
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:13,242
Kang-ho, congratulations!

132
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:25,505
You've done well, my friend.

133
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:29,175
Here we have the Best Actor and Actress.

134
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:31,511
-Congratulations!
-Thank you.

135
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:32,595
Oh, cheers.

136
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,805
Are there any roles
you might want to take?

137
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:38,476
A passionate romance
with a handsome young man?

138
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,644
Well, you know,

139
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:43,147
in the real world, men are always
dating younger women, aren't they?

140
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,398
Totally.

141
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:48,069
Jeez, does she have to say that
in a place like that?

142
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:49,570
Seriously!

143
00:08:53,407 --> 00:08:55,826
It's a crime when an older man meets
a young woman,

144
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,496
so why is it romance
when an older woman meets a young man?

145
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,957
Hey, did you leave this comment?

146
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:03,543
No way.

147
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,878
-You read it, word for word.
-No way!

148
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,046
Read it.

149
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:08,965
-It is you, right?
-Is not.

150
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:12,093
-It definitely sounds like you.
-Let me see.

151
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:14,011
-Did you check the ID?
-Hey.

152
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:17,014
You can make as many accounts as you want.

153
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,058
-Fine, it's me. What about it?
-I knew it.

154
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,851
It wasn't me!

155
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,603
They are arguing in the comments.

156
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,106
A movie fact.
A girl hits a guy, that's comedy.

157
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:26,774
A guy hits a girl, that's horror.

158
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:29,694
-Women should join the army too.
-Bringing up military service again.

159
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:31,696
Men should get periods
and get pregnant too.

160
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:34,031
A gift if a girl steals a kiss.
Jail if it's a guy.

161
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:34,991
Don't make stuff up.

162
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:38,160
Guys, "I'm poor. I can't get married."
Girls, "He's poor. I can't marry him."

163
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:41,622
It's not just being poor preventing
your marriage, it's everything else too!

164
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,207
I'm rich, and I'm married!

165
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,709
Yeah, right! You're funny!

166
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:49,922
-What should we eat to sober up?
-Oh, wait.

167
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,173
Damn it!

168
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:55,511
"Damn it"?

169
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:56,929
What's up with her?

170
00:09:58,931 --> 00:09:59,765
Let's just go.

171
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:04,353
EPISODE 1
BAD GIRL

172
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:05,938
"Dear Mr. and Mrs. Yeo,

173
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:09,191
who I'm sure have raised
Ms. Yeo Mi-ran with tender loving care,

174
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,444
you must have spent so many days praying

175
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:14,530
to help your daughter grow up
and become a lawyer."

176
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:18,451
"You worried about her
when she stayed up late studying

177
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:21,162
and that she might catch a cold
on the day of exams."

178
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,457
"I'm sure you will never forget

179
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,376
the day she passed her bar exam."

180
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,295
Tell them we'll track them down.

181
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,715
How can a matchmaker find out
a lawyer's home address?

182
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:37,678
"But you can never stop worrying
about your child."

183
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:41,515
"More so because a marriage
can make or break one's life."

184
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:45,436
"With 25 years of experience,
I assure you I'll do my best

185
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:49,690
to find the perfect partner
for your daughter as if she's my own--"

186
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:53,194
When are we eating?
Why are you reading the whole thing?

187
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:55,029
It's different this time!

188
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:57,615
It's handwritten!
They didn't even photocopy it.

189
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:59,742
So what?
Will she meet an arranged match now?

190
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,287
Why are you yelling at Mom again?

191
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:04,830
He wasn't yelling!

192
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:07,875
There are a lot of good candidates,
but you won't meet them,

193
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,210
so he's just anxious.

194
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:11,879
Still, why yell at her?
I'm the one turning them down.

195
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:13,047
Why, you little…

196
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,966
How dare you raise your voice to me?
Where are your manners?

197
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:18,219
Stop fighting over nothing!

198
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,930
I'll get you some food.
Eat before you go, okay?

199
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,348
I need to talk to you.

200
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,186
What is this?

201
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:30,189
The tuition fee
for the law school you hated so much.

202
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:31,899
I said I'd pay you back.

203
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:40,324
ONE HUNDRED MILLION WON

204
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,704
A third of that was from part-time work,

205
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:47,873
but I put in a little more
for raising me under your roof.

206
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,421
Back then, I only wanted you to get a job
and not sit the bar exam

207
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:56,841
because I was worried
the time and money would go to waste.

208
00:11:56,924 --> 00:12:00,094
They say the exam's hard, even
for students from the top law schools.

209
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:02,888
-I'm moving next week.
-You're moving next week?

210
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:07,184
Your law firm only has two people.
Why do you need to move the office?

211
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,103
No, I'm moving out of here.

212
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:10,646
I'm going to live on my own.

213
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:14,233
What is she on about?

214
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:15,192
What?

215
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,361
She's moving out.

216
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:20,406
You always tell me not to do what I want,
so I didn't tell you.

217
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:23,159
Mom didn't know about it,
so don't nag at her.

218
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,161
I'm off now.

219
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,996
You should eat something.

220
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,748
I don't have time. See you later.

221
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:34,837
I won't be hearing that
once she moves out…

222
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,631
Why didn't you tell me?!
You knew all along!

223
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:42,178
Don't yell at her!
You can yell at me if you want!

224
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,721
Why are you yelling at Mom?

225
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:45,181
She's not your punching bag.

226
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,224
-How rude of you--
-What's gotten into you?

227
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,309
Get to work now!

228
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:50,978
Have a good day, okay?

229
00:12:51,061 --> 00:12:52,772
Don't forget to eat!

230
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:56,525
No wonder this country is a mess
with a lawyer like you!

231
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:59,445
The guy took out 40 million won
under your name,

232
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:02,072
bought a car with 20 million won,

233
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,325
and he sold the car for 10 million.

234
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:07,411
That's 30 million won profit,
and he did that 29 times.

235
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:10,456
I'm saying
there are 29 more kids like you.

236
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:13,417
How can you get a loan for 40 million
on a 20-million-won car?

237
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:14,668
Using a kid's name?

238
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:18,297
There are guys in loan companies
who set up codes for such loans.

239
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,965
One of them must be in on this.

240
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,759
What a bunch of assholes…

241
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:23,385
I really don't know anything.

242
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:27,640
He said I'd get four million won a month
if I let him use my name.

243
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:31,977
He only got paid once
and nothing for the rest of the year.

244
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:34,313
He doesn't know anything, Detective!

245
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,983
I never thought
he would do something like this to me!

246
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,403
I'd been so nice to him.

247
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:43,656
How could he use me for such…

248
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:48,160
Hey, don't worry.
I won't let you take the fall.

249
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:51,121
-I want to kill him.
-I totally get you.

250
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,456
Those bastards…

251
00:13:53,415 --> 00:13:54,875
I'll get them and kill them.

252
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:57,461
You shouldn't kill them.

253
00:14:01,298 --> 00:14:03,133
Detective Lee will catch them.

254
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,844
He's known as God's Hunch.

255
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:10,683
Why did you let him use your name?

256
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:12,434
You only met him at the boxing gym.

257
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:14,979
I met you at the boxing gym,
and you're helping me now!

258
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:16,313
Jeez…

259
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:23,988
Eat up, will you?

260
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,909
Mi-ran, thank you!

261
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,287
Okay. Eat before the food gets cold.

262
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:36,709
You are a really nice person.

263
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:39,169
-Hurry up and eat.
-Okay.

264
00:14:58,522 --> 00:15:01,191
God, this place is disgustingly far.

265
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,278
What are you doing?

266
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:07,489
Do you find it cute
to see a grown-up woman like that?

267
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:09,825
She lost all her money.

268
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,577
She's frustrated to death,

269
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,454
but a pretty view makes her dance?

270
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:16,206
Romance writers are all psychos.

271
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:19,001
She trips and drops papers all the time.

272
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:20,586
Why would anyone like her?

273
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,421
An idiot and a nuisance.

274
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:25,507
But she says something right once,
and I fall for her for being sensible.

275
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:28,510
If you can't stand her,
then just don't look.

276
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:30,638
Let's go.

277
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,307
-Huh?
-To the rehearsal!

278
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:40,272
I'm the one suffering, you know.

279
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:41,649
Come on.

280
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:44,818
Action, noir…

281
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,946
Let me try those.
I'm sick and tired of this.

282
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,114
Try them when you get offers.
I won't stop you.

283
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,783
-Hello.
-Oh, hi.

284
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,201
He's so handsome!

285
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:55,454
But you'll get injured
and live with the consequences.

286
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:57,706
And no commercials.

287
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,041
-Hello.
-Oh!

288
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,710
-Hi, have you eaten?
-Yes.

289
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,712
Commercials? Wow.

290
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,298
You're a cold-blooded boss, you know.

291
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:08,217
Okay.

292
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:10,386
Anyway, let's stop doing romance
for a while.

293
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,388
A rest will do you no harm.

294
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:13,806
-Hello.
-Hello.

295
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,809
-Oh! Hello!
-Hello.

296
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:18,894
-We meet again.
-Yes.

297
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,562
-Way to go!
-Way to go!

298
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,318
He might as well be an actor himself.

299
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,821
He used to be, but he's such a bad actor.

300
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:31,615
Oh, so God didn't give him everything.

301
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:33,701
Now, as Master of Kisses,

302
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,995
you should do a grown-up kiss this time.

303
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:38,914
So it's a kiss,
but it's almost like making love.

304
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:54,722
Don't close your eyes.

305
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,891
Wait, was there a line here?

306
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,018
I just tried it.

307
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,728
Oh, that's good.

308
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:02,855
Hey, my heart just skipped a beat.

309
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:06,108
Wow, you've gotten better. Not bad.

310
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,736
What was it you said?
"Don't close your eyes."

311
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:11,572
-Ask the director to put it in the script.
-Okay.

312
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:12,823
And in this scene,

313
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:15,659
don't just ram your face in like this.

314
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,995
Instead, wrap your arm around and pull.

315
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:21,415
If you wrap your arm around
and pull her in,

316
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:24,626
she will be like this
and try to move her face away from you.

317
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,003
And naturally,

318
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,088
fall backward.

319
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,968
Now, get in the mood.

320
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:58,619
Don't close your eyes.

321
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,764
Oh God!

322
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:20,349
-Damn it!
-My mistake!

323
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:24,144
-Did you do that on purpose?
-No, I got pulled down by your weight.

324
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:25,896
-Damn…
-You know what?

325
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:27,272
That was our first kiss.

326
00:18:27,356 --> 00:18:30,234
What are you on about? You nutjob.
Get off me already.

327
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:31,693
-Hang on.
-Jeez, get off me!

328
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:32,611
Okay!

329
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:37,699
-I'm sorry.
-What do you mean "sorry"?

330
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,368
Hey, where are you going?

331
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:42,121
We were just practicing!
Practicing for the scene!

332
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:46,458
-Wow.
-Why so shocked?

333
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,585
What's with the sigh of relief?

334
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:51,380
I quit. You can practice with Sang-sup.

335
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:53,674
I'm sorry, but I didn't like it either.

336
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,051
Excuse me?

337
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:59,221
-Yeah.
-Why are you here anyway?

338
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:03,267
They said the shoot was delayed
and to just sit back and wait.

339
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:04,935
You can take a nap too.

340
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:07,771
Wow, that means
we are not wrapping up today.

341
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,523
Is it Hwang Ji-hye again?

342
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:15,404
What's all this?

343
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,739
You know, the contingency fee.

344
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,659
-What?
-It's better this way.

345
00:19:20,742 --> 00:19:24,163
The empty lot we got last time
is never going to sell.

346
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:25,914
I don't see how this is better.

347
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,332
What will you do with these?

348
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:29,751
I'll eat them. You'll eat them.

349
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,421
Give them out as gifts. Donate them…

350
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:35,924
I mean, we can't sell them, can we?

351
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:39,219
Oh, Seung-gu has a truck.
We can borrow it and drive around?

352
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,096
Really? Sounds good.

353
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:45,893
Seung-gu, we were just talking about you.

354
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:48,729
Mi-ran, those bastards are hanging out
in Jindo right now.

355
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:50,689
-I'm on my way to catch them!
-What?

356
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:53,108
Hello?

357
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:55,360
Why? Does he want money?

358
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,404
Seung-gu's on his way to catch the crook.

359
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,239
-Where?
-Jindo.

360
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,909
-Where in Jindo? God!
-I want to kill him.

361
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:04,286
I'll get them and kill them.

362
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:08,415
Sung-ho, call the police.

363
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:09,666
-Please!
-Oh, okay.

364
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:14,504
Detective Lee just called.
They are at Sol Beach Resort.

365
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:17,174
They checked in under the name
of the crook's little brother.

366
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,675
Did he call the local police?

367
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:20,093
Yeah, he said he did.

368
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:21,720
Okay.

369
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,057
God, Seung-gu…

370
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,643
Please don't do anything stupid. Okay?

371
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,646
Please don't do anything stupid.

372
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,397
Go. Don't worry about me.

373
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:33,482
Mr. Do!

374
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,110
-Assistant director?
-I'm really sorry.

375
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:38,862
But we need your help.

376
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,155
What?

377
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:42,866
She won't listen to the director,
but maybe to a fellow actor.

378
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,743
What's the problem?

379
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:46,578
I mean,

380
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:49,665
are you telling me
you can't put on the makeup

381
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:52,042
just in case
you get a cosmetics commercial?

382
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:55,671
When the show goes on the air,
I'll get one for sure.

383
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:58,840
But if I use another product
after I get one,

384
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,759
what would the advertiser say?

385
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:04,388
We can shoot this scene
with just the hairstyling.

386
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:06,056
Do we have to use makeup?

387
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:06,974
Okay.

388
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:10,477
First, you don't have an offer
from any kind of makeup brand yet,

389
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,104
and I need to shoot this show now.

390
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:15,357
And this scene was created
for product placement,

391
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,776
so we can't take the scene out whatsoever.

392
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:21,196
Why should I be responsible
for the show's product placement?

393
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,533
I'm not responsible for it either.

394
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:27,077
But don't you know
that most production companies

395
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,954
are losing money now, Ji-hye?!

396
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:30,747
Huh? We are losing money!

397
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:35,752
Ma'am, did you just yell at me?

398
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:38,630
The assistant director asked for help.

399
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:41,842
You want the lead actor to not care
about the shoot getting delayed?

400
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:44,386
The whole staff is waiting.
We have to start filming.

401
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,013
Yes, we have to.

402
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:48,223
But if you step up, we can't.

403
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:51,018
Hey, do you think
you can hold yourself back

404
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:52,477
when you see her face?

405
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:55,522
The moment you see her face,
you'll say what's on your mind.

406
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:58,650
You couldn't hold yourself back
and were grumbling

407
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,235
when you saw her acting alone.

408
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,821
I can hold back.
I took my pills a while ago.

409
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:04,531
How many times did they help you?

410
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:08,035
I can name more than ten actresses
who had a meltdown

411
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:09,536
because of you and your pills.

412
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:12,873
And I'm the one who has to clean up
the mess all alone!

413
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:17,419
That's why I have to come along
every time you shoot these scenes.

414
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:18,337
No.

415
00:22:19,629 --> 00:22:21,214
I can do it this time.

416
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,008
Trust me, this once.

417
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:25,260
No way. I'm not buying it.

418
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,970
-No way.
-Just this once.

419
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,015
-No trouble.
-What do you mean by that?

420
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:31,641
-Where are you going?
-Thanks.

421
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:33,560
-Thanks for what? Hey!
-You're the best!

422
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:35,145
Hey, don't go! I'm serious!

423
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:37,272
-Okay, thanks!
-Hey!

424
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:41,485
You! Hey!

425
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:46,448
Who's this prick?

426
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:48,617
Little brat!

427
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,540
Take him inside. Hurry!

428
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:58,335
You little shit!

429
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:04,007
-Seung-gu!
-Mi-ran!

430
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,092
Damn it!

431
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:23,485
You! Come here!

432
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:35,122
What's your deal?

433
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,717
-Hey, are you okay?
-Yes, Mi-ran!

434
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:54,391
I heard she was a lawyer,
not Michelle Yeoh.

435
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:56,852
Oops!

436
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:12,159
Kang-ho, sorry to keep you waiting.

437
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:14,244
It's fine. I'll try to talk to her.

438
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:21,334
I'm sure you have a reason
for acting this way,

439
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:24,754
but think of this as advice
from an actor with more experience.

440
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:30,093
The filming conditions for this show
are as good as they get.

441
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:33,638
We have a good director.
There are no last-minute scripts.

442
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:36,141
We got the script a week ago, right?

443
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,894
Let's just shoot it the way it is now.

444
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:41,188
The staff members are waiting for us too.

445
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:42,105
Okay?

446
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:47,861
I don't talk about them,
but I have my own complaints too.

447
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:49,696
So…

448
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:51,615
Okay?

449
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:57,746
But you know what, Kang-ho?

450
00:24:58,371 --> 00:24:59,539
This scene

451
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:04,252
is about the character trying to look good
before going on a date, right?

452
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:06,713
I came up with an idea.

453
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:09,299
What if I look in the mirror
and try various expressions

454
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:10,759
instead of putting on makeup?

455
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:14,763
This.

456
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:18,433
And this. Or…

457
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:21,603
smiling with my eyes like this!

458
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:26,358
Cheap charms that show who you are.

459
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:31,029
Or how about a sexy

460
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,533
and enticing look?

461
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:37,494
Like this.

462
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:40,914
I can pretend to tie my hair

463
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,208
and show my neck.

464
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:47,045
Cheap flirtations that show who you are.

465
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:58,098
Ji-hye!

466
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,517
What are you doing? Hurry up!

467
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,352
-Ji-hye, let's talk!
-Ji-hye, stop!

468
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:04,020
Ji-hye, stop right there!

469
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:05,772
-My legs hurt! Ji-hye!
-Ji-hye!

470
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:06,940
Hurry!

471
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:08,817
Ji-hye, come on! Ji-hye!

472
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:11,319
Ji-hye, I'm gonna get mad!

473
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,113
Ji-hye, open this door.

474
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:16,032
Open the… Ow, seriously!

475
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:18,034
Oh no! She can't go like this!

476
00:26:18,118 --> 00:26:19,452
What should I do?

477
00:26:20,787 --> 00:26:22,622
-What should I do?
-What should we do?

478
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:25,208
Ow, that girl! Damn it!

479
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:26,960
I don't know! Call her.

480
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:33,592
Won-jun, I really didn't say anything.

481
00:26:33,675 --> 00:26:35,302
"The staff members are waiting."

482
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:37,554
"Let's stick to the script."
That's all I said!

483
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:42,809
Then how is it that she got so pale?

484
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:46,313
I must have made a face
because she was being obnoxious.

485
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:48,648
But I held back and kept my mouth shut!

486
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:51,943
Right, the cameras.
Do they have security cameras?

487
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:54,195
You can check if I said anything or not.

488
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:56,656
If I knew this would happen,

489
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,950
I would've just told her
what was on my mind.

490
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,410
"You call yourself an actress?"

491
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:02,662
"Do you act so you can be on commercials?"

492
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:05,373
"But you'll never get an offer. Why?"

493
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:07,876
"Because you are so unlikable!"

494
00:27:09,836 --> 00:27:11,630
So you were going easy in the gym.

495
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,132
-Did you go to a sports university?
-Dumbass.

496
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:16,384
I majored in liberal arts.
Law school, remember?

497
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,303
Right, you're a lawyer!

498
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:20,764
Where's your car?

499
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:21,931
Over on that side.

500
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:24,309
Really? Mine's here.

501
00:27:24,392 --> 00:27:25,894
We should say goodbye.

502
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:27,520
Drive home safely.

503
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,815
I will never forget
what you've done for me. Salute!

504
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:33,943
Jeez, you should work hard
and be a good son to your mom.

505
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:37,447
-Bye, then.
-Okay. Goodbye.

506
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:38,531
See you.

507
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:48,500
Her goal is to get a rich man.
Why does she even work?

508
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:50,710
So she can be worth more?

509
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:54,964
So she can be worth more and more
and sell herself

510
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:56,758
to the man who pays the most!

511
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:02,097
Yeah, well,
that's what every woman dreams of.

512
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:05,266
-Are you done?
-Yeah.

513
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,352
-Then get in the car.
-You're not going?

514
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:11,523
Are you telling me to leave
when the director is having a breakdown?

515
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:12,982
It was Hwang Ji-hye's fault!

516
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:14,317
Get out of here.

517
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:27,372
So she can be worth more and more
and sell herself

518
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:29,124
to the man who pays the most!

519
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:30,917
NAM KANG-HO, MAN OF MANNERS

520
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,377
Yeah, well,

521
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:35,130
that's what every woman dreams of.

522
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:36,297
LEG MANNERS THIS TIME

523
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:38,550
A new type showed up.

524
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:40,427
Type Dracula.

525
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:42,679
Enjoy the food.

526
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:48,685
I would say it's a kind of psychosis.

527
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:51,563
He wins over women's hearts
and sucks on their blood,

528
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:53,898
but only thinks of them
as prey and not humans!

529
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,902
No way. Are you sure it was him?

530
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,446
That's why I double-checked it.

531
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:02,157
Nam Kang-ho and Hwang Ji-hye
were there for a shoot.

532
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,992
Maybe he was rehearsing?

533
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:06,870
If he was rehearsing,
he wouldn't have been all worked up.

534
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:10,039
And no matter the context,
his words are too straightforward.

535
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:13,835
He's a misogynist
who thinks all women are prostitutes!

536
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:17,088
I really liked Kang-ho…

537
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:20,383
No, you've got it all wrong.

538
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:24,512
What do you know about men?
You fall for anyone good-looking.

539
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:27,474
Do you even know what men say about women?

540
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:29,309
Love? Don't be ridiculous.

541
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:31,978
They only think of us
as possessions or sexual objects.

542
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:33,480
When a guy gets heartbroken,

543
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:36,065
his friends show him porn to cheer him up!

544
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:39,778
That's how they feel they're superior
and controlling us.

545
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:41,613
It's their nature to favor the strong.

546
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:44,240
They suck up to the strong
and crush the weak!

547
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:46,951
At the same time,
they try to define women as weak!

548
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:50,371
-Why am I so hot?
-There are exceptions.

549
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:53,666
Oh, here comes an example.

550
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:57,170
Why'd you dump him then?
He's a rare breed. Handsome enough too.

551
00:29:57,837 --> 00:29:59,839
I didn't dump him! We didn't even go out.

552
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:02,425
Oh dear. It's been a while, Na-eun.

553
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:03,676
How are you doing?

554
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,677
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

555
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:06,221
-I'll have the same drink.
-Sure.

556
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:09,557
Wow, the junior lawyer
gets off work first to go drinking,

557
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:11,059
and the senior works overtime.

558
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:12,560
It's the dream job.

559
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:14,646
Not at all.

560
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:17,732
We take lots of low-paying cases,
so Mi-ran has it rough.

561
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,985
Do you know anyone who needs potatoes
or a useless piece of land?

562
00:30:22,862 --> 00:30:23,947
What do you mean?

563
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:24,989
Don't do it.

564
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:27,659
That's what our clients paid
instead of money.

565
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:29,661
Huh? They didn't pay the fee?

566
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,330
It's not like that.

567
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:34,541
He agreed to it from the beginning.

568
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:36,376
-Hey!
-Here's your drink.

569
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:38,795
Congratulations to Mi-ran
and Na-eun on moving out.

570
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:40,505
Have a great life!

571
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:42,715
Okay, thank you, Mr. Potato!

572
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:47,929
Where are you?

573
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:51,224
Are you still with the director?

574
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:53,434
Don't worry about me and go to bed.

575
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:54,811
I'm sorry, Won-jun.

576
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:56,563
Go to bed now.

577
00:30:56,646 --> 00:30:57,981
-Okay.
-Yeah.

578
00:31:02,944 --> 00:31:07,866
Ma'am, Kang-ho is very worried
about you right now.

579
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:10,285
Kang-ho wants me to tell you

580
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:12,161
that you should cheer up.

581
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:14,831
Wow, Kang-ho is the best!

582
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:16,666
I'm really grateful to you.

583
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:19,544
I know you're a busy man.

584
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:20,879
What are you talking about?

585
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:23,756
This is my job.

586
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,093
I haven't had a chance to drink
with you in a while.

587
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:28,928
It feels so good!

588
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:31,806
-So good.
-But you know what?

589
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:36,060
Ji-hye is the one who messed up,
and she didn't even call me.

590
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:40,356
I'm so frustrated because of her!

591
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,109
Jeez, I can imagine how mad you must be.

592
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:46,988
I bet Ji-hye is regretting her actions
as we speak.

593
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:48,615
Hey, don't worry.

594
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:50,366
I'll talk to Ji-hye's people

595
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:53,870
and get your cameras rolling right away!

596
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:58,625
Thank you. I believe only in you, Mr. Do.

597
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,004
Hey, stop!

598
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:05,798
What are you doing?
You had too much to drink.

599
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:07,884
Let's have another round!

600
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:11,471
-Take care!
-Goodbye!

601
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:13,181
Thank you, sir!

602
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:17,560
Hey!

603
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:19,979
-Oh, thank you!
-Are you okay?

604
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:21,981
Yes, I'm perfectly fine.

605
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:25,276
Hang on a sec. The taxi is on its way.

606
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,695
Mr. Do. You know what? I'm…

607
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:30,448
I'm so exhausted!

608
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:34,327
I'm so exhausted from getting knocked
this way and that way.

609
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,831
God, I so know what you mean.

610
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:41,668
You're in the middle,
getting knocked this way and that way.

611
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:43,294
I know you do the hardest work.

612
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:46,631
So, how about one more drink?

613
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:47,882
Just one more.

614
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:50,051
-One more drink.
-Whoa, what's the…

615
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:51,719
Jeez, look at the time!

616
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,972
Won-jun!

617
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,765
Just one more drink. I'm buying.

618
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:57,225
If I'm buying--

619
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:59,018
Hey, wait!

620
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:01,980
I'm okay.

621
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:03,064
-You're okay?
-Yes.

622
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:04,607
Did you swallow it?

623
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:06,359
-Jeez, ma'am!
-Yes!

624
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:07,777
Hey! Open your eyes!

625
00:33:08,903 --> 00:33:11,656
I think we should call it a day now.

626
00:33:12,281 --> 00:33:14,367
-Okay.
-You might regret this tomorrow.

627
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:18,663
When your life gets hard,
and you do something you'd regret,

628
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:20,581
that makes it even harder!

629
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:21,666
Right?

630
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:26,379
Oh, taxi.

631
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:27,922
Here, hop in.

632
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,048
It's going to my house?

633
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:31,676
Yes, it will drop you off
right in front of your house.

634
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:34,095
You did good today!

635
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:39,892
I bet you're going to thank me tomorrow

636
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:42,020
because

637
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:45,857
one of the hardest things to endure

638
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:47,775
is embarrassment.

639
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:50,570
One hundred million for a deposit.
1.5 million for rent?

640
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,322
Hey, we don't have to tell him how much.

641
00:33:53,406 --> 00:33:55,575
Yes, and the deposit is all debt.

642
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:58,453
So I'm telling you to take
loads of high-paying cases

643
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:00,288
on top of the good deeds you're doing.

644
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:03,166
This girl is our breadwinner.

645
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:05,043
She'll be paying 70%!

646
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:08,963
Don't bother your head about it.

647
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,798
We already make enough to get by.

648
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:13,009
No, that's not it.

649
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:17,180
I'm thinking we could live together.

650
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:18,848
Then I can share your burden.

651
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:22,226
Great idea!
We have three rooms, so we can do that.

652
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:24,145
You're right, but…

653
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:26,814
I am

654
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:29,358
good at cleaning.

655
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:31,944
Even better at cooking.

656
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:37,283
Are you now?

657
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:43,831
I knew it. You're still into me, right?

658
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,208
How can we live together?

659
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,502
My feelings are my own.

660
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:49,337
I won't act on it.

661
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:52,757
It's going to be fun living together.

662
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,384
I'll move out, okay?

663
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:02,266
A picture paints a thousand words.

664
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,644
Good thing I came here
without asking you about it.

665
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:08,856
Eun-jung.

666
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,775
How did you get here?

667
00:35:10,858 --> 00:35:11,943
How did I get here?

668
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:14,445
I took the train and followed you.

669
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:16,948
A weekend couple
can still see each other on weekdays.

670
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:18,074
"Couple"?

671
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:21,202
If you date for seven years,
you're basically married.

672
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:23,162
Sung-ho, you had a girlfriend?

673
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,206
Eun-jung.

674
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:26,958
-Let's talk outside.
-No!

675
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:29,752
I already stalked you.
I have nothing more to be ashamed of.

676
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:32,755
Who are you?

677
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:33,673
Me?

678
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:37,176
-Eun-jung!
-I'm the lawyer working with Sung-ho.

679
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,886
And she is my friend.

680
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:42,890
You said you were working
with a male lawyer.

681
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:47,728
What's your relationship with him?

682
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,230
Nothing.

683
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:51,732
So, you just hold hands with a nobody?

684
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,401
Are Seoul women all like you?

685
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:56,445
-What an easy girl.
-Excuse me?

686
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:58,030
-Eun-jung!
-Hello?

687
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:01,701
You are out of line.
What's with the insults?

688
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:03,494
Don't I have the right?

689
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:04,912
She's the other woman.

690
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:06,247
I am not!

691
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,666
Eun-jung!
You're embarrassing me. Come out!

692
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:11,377
What's wrong with you?
I'm the one who should be mad!

693
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:13,588
Wait a second.

694
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:14,714
Tell us the truth.

695
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:16,090
So, is she right?

696
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:17,133
For seven years?

697
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,510
Well…

698
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:22,972
Excuse me, miss.

699
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:25,808
Your boyfriend is the one who wronged you!

700
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:28,394
Even if he did cheat on you,
I hate women who take it out

701
00:36:28,477 --> 00:36:30,897
on the other woman
and not their boyfriends.

702
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,106
Stop it now.

703
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,859
Eun-jung. I'm sorry.

704
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:37,820
We shouldn't do this here.

705
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:40,406
-This is all part of love too.
-Let go of me!

706
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:42,366
-Why are you dragging me out?
-I don't know!

707
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,873
-You should not do this.
-Let go!

708
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:51,918
Just say you want to break up.

709
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:53,961
Why did you lie?

710
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:56,005
What? You work with a man?

711
00:36:56,088 --> 00:36:58,341
-You are busy on weekends?
-I've been busy!

712
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:00,635
We were having a drink
for the first time in a while!

713
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:02,136
And us holding hands?

714
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,473
It's a misunderstanding.

715
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:07,808
-Eun-jung's misunderstanding.
-No, it's not.

716
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:10,019
What about you pretending to be single?

717
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:12,480
Okay, then,

718
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:13,981
who is "I Love You"?

719
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,191
Na Eun-jung!

720
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:18,569
Did you go through my phone?

721
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:23,199
Whenever he broke things off
with women he'd been flirting with,

722
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:24,951
I drank to comfort him.

723
00:37:26,869 --> 00:37:28,037
For three years!

724
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:30,122
That can happen.

725
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,875
Even monkeys fall from trees.

726
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:35,378
Okay, let's just say
I didn't know about it.

727
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,506
That bastard got me to set him up
with my friend?

728
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:41,634
No. You can't beat him up.

729
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:44,303
You'll keep working, right?

730
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:45,471
What?

731
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:46,889
With Sung-ho.

732
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:50,601
You'll keep working there, right?

733
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:53,771
You want me to work with the bastard
who tried to two-time my friend?

734
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,318
I'm sorry

735
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:01,946
for trying to set you up with a jerk.

736
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:03,489
Do you see now?

737
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:05,741
You always have to doubt men.

738
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,619
A reliable guy? A friend?

739
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:11,163
Trust no one, not even my friend.

740
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:12,748
There is no exception.

741
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,293
Do lawyers

742
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:18,546
get unemployment benefits?

743
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:21,507
Hey, don't worry about the money!

744
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,259
I'm a lawyer! The moneymaker!

745
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:24,343
I can afford the rent.

746
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,721
Right?

747
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:30,099
It's even worse than
a boyfriend turning out to be a prick.

748
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:32,518
I lost my only guy friend.

749
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:36,856
The last hope I had for men is now gone.

750
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:37,940
CLAIM FOR DAMAGE

751
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:39,775
If you drop out of the show,

752
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:43,529
production is expected
to claim 7.9 billion won for damages.

753
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:45,656
That's the cost of production
and reshooting.

754
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:50,328
And if Nam Kang-ho opposes the reshoot,
you will have to pay for his damages too.

755
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,204
No one's dropping out!

756
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:56,375
When an actress gets ill,
the shoot can surely be delayed!

757
00:38:56,459 --> 00:39:00,004
If you delay it without a doctor's note,
they can file a claim for damages.

758
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:02,631
I'm in immense mental pain right now,

759
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:05,217
so I just can't bring myself
to see Mr. Nam Kang-ho.

760
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:07,428
A few girls have told me

761
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:09,638
that the man is totally two-faced.

762
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:13,267
He's nice when the cameras are on
and very unfriendly when they're off.

763
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:16,979
If what you just said gets published
in the media,

764
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:19,732
that will fall under libel
and spread of false information.

765
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:22,068
It's not false! I heard it myself!

766
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:23,778
Would the public believe you?

767
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:26,530
"The good angel.
The world's nicest celebrity."

768
00:39:26,614 --> 00:39:29,367
Will they believe a top star
with ten years of experience?

769
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,118
Or will they believe you,

770
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:34,330
who's shooting only your second film,
and whose anti-fans are increasing?

771
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:35,456
What was that?

772
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:38,000
The number of members
in your anti-fan community

773
00:39:38,084 --> 00:39:41,337
is 27,368 as of today.

774
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:42,755
Three more than yesterday.

775
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:47,510
We've informed you that Ms. Hwang alone
is responsible for stopping the shoot,

776
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:50,846
and Mr. Nam Kang-ho
is irrelevant to this incident.

777
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,348
-Let's go.
-Okay.

778
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:55,643
Just shoot it and don't whine.
This happened due to your fussiness.

779
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:57,770
But you're the one who got my hopes up!

780
00:39:57,853 --> 00:39:59,355
You said I'd do a cosmetics ad!

781
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:00,815
How dare you talk back!

782
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:02,566
-In front of the guests!
-Hey.

783
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:04,402
Take her out!

784
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:06,195
GILMU
LAW CORPORATION

785
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:10,157
Do Won-jun is impressive.

786
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:11,909
He preemptively gathered evidence.

787
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:13,452
-Gilmu!
-Indeed.

788
00:40:14,328 --> 00:40:16,789
If you keep this up,
I'll get a new law firm!

789
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:26,674
Hello, ma'am!

790
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:35,808
It appears that Ms. Choi is very upset.

791
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:40,479
I advised that leaving her house
without a reason would be unfavorable

792
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:41,647
for her divorce--

793
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:45,151
Then you should do something
so I can come out whenever I want!

794
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:50,114
He's just a kid who's never been married,
let alone gone through a divorce.

795
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:51,323
I want another lawyer.

796
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,033
Mr. Ko.

797
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:55,494
How would you like to help her personally?

798
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:00,624
Of course I'll help you,

799
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:03,377
but you'll also need a lawyer
who is dedicated to you.

800
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:04,962
Men don't get what I say.

801
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:06,297
I want a female lawyer.

802
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:09,884
But we don't have any female lawyers here.

803
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:11,010
Then get me one,

804
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:13,262
or I'll tell Won-jun
to look for another firm!

805
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:15,639
Come on, don't be so harsh!

806
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:18,684
If we have no female lawyers,
we can hire one!

807
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:21,729
But on second thought,

808
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:25,065
there's no guarantee
that you will like the new recruit.

809
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:27,067
Then put me in the interview room.

810
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:29,570
-Goodbye.
-What? I…

811
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:32,490
Have a safe trip home.

812
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:33,574
Okay.

813
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,953
Gosh, this is driving me crazy!

814
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:39,580
Jeez, seriously!

815
00:41:40,831 --> 00:41:43,584
-What's your plan?
-We have no choice but to hire one!

816
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:45,503
That client is worth tens of billions!

817
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:48,756
Women…

818
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:50,007
But they are a pain.

819
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:52,218
With their menstrual leave
and maternity leave…

820
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:53,636
"Discrimination, inequality."

821
00:41:53,719 --> 00:41:55,930
-Yap, yap.
-That's why they should enlist too!

822
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:00,476
Is there a female lawyer who served?

823
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:04,396
Wow, look at the view! It's amazing!

824
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:08,150
It's wonderful, right?

825
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:12,071
Do you stand by the window all day?
Why is everyone obsessed with the view?

826
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:14,949
-Ridiculous.
-You'd love it if you saw it in person.

827
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:16,951
Look. This is the living room.

828
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:20,329
And do you see the kitchen over there?

829
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:22,373
This house is huge!

830
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:26,502
Oh, and this is Na-eun's room.

831
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:27,503
There's Na-eun!

832
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:30,172
-Na-eun, say hi.
-Hi, Mr. Yeo!

833
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:34,468
Oh, I'll show you Mi-ran's room now.

834
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:42,184
Going somewhere?

835
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:44,353
Yeah, to the office.

836
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:46,438
On moving day?

837
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:49,733
I have a lot of work to do.
You should go now.

838
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:50,734
Hang up now.

839
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:52,653
It's your dad. Say hello.

840
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,242
I did when I left the house!

841
00:42:58,325 --> 00:43:00,911
Tell him to come over
after you're done cleaning up!

842
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:06,208
You should come over
after I'm done cleaning up.

843
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:07,668
No, thanks. I've seen it all.

844
00:43:08,877 --> 00:43:10,838
What's with your tone?

845
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:17,761
You should be very proud
that she moved out with her own money!

846
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:21,682
Mom, you should go.
Come back when it's cleaned up.

847
00:43:21,765 --> 00:43:23,434
Oh, what is there to unpack…

848
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:25,936
Oh, mister! Don't put that there!

849
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,104
That's not the spot.

850
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:30,441
Excuse me. This goes into that room.

851
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:32,818
And this goes over there.

852
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:35,529
Leave some work for me.
I'll clean up when I get home.

853
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,072
Good luck!

Thank you. We'll give you a call.

860
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:08,312
I'm afraid
we'll have to call you next time.

We'll see you next time.

862

Hey, lawyer.

866
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:33,962
What are you doing out here?

867
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:38,050
What should I do?

868
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:40,302
It turns out I'm not a lawyer.

869
00:44:40,803 --> 00:44:42,137
I'm just a liar.

870
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:47,184
Things didn't go well?

871
00:44:47,267 --> 00:44:49,061
Nah, I don't think so.

872
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:51,438
There are lots of law firms in this world.

873
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,107
You'll be hired if you keep trying.

874
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:58,529
There aren't many places left to try now.

875
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:00,781
Human rights lawyer sounds nice.

876
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:03,450
But I only became one
because I couldn't go anywhere else.

877
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:06,370
I failed to get into a law firm,
but I had to save face.

878
00:45:06,453 --> 00:45:09,331
Do you live to be respected
by your dad? Fine.

879
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:12,960
You gritted your teeth and became a lawyer
to spite your dad, and I get that.

880
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:16,046
But you've done enough.
Stop pushing yourself so hard.

881
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:19,967
Jeez, I should have stayed sharp
and stopped us from choosing

882
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,760
an expensive house like this.

883
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,930
Don't stress about the rent.

884
00:45:25,013 --> 00:45:27,224
I'll get a part-time job if I have to.

885
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:31,729
I'm sorry this worries you,
but I won't make you work for it.

886
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:33,063
I have no work, anyway.

887
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:35,107
They reduced my flights for next month.

888
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:38,110
They want people
to take voluntary redundancy.

889
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,075
-You got a text.
-Okay.

890
00:45:46,034 --> 00:45:48,036
Do lawyers get turned down by text?

891
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:51,123
Damn it, they sent a text
to a seasoned professional?

892
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:52,583
Who is it?

893
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:56,503
GILMU LAW CORPORATION, CONGRATULATIONS
ON PASSING THE APPLICATION REVIEW

894
00:45:58,088 --> 00:45:59,256
-Huh?
-What?

895
00:46:00,632 --> 00:46:02,926
What is it?
"Time and date for the interview"?

896
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:06,847
There is a place left to try!

897
00:46:08,098 --> 00:46:09,433
It's Lee Jin-suh's law firm.

898
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:12,686
-A bunch of scoundrels.
-Oh.

899
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:17,024
But why me?

900
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:21,612
-Why is a woman here?
-They won't hire her.

901
00:46:26,867 --> 00:46:28,410
-Ms. Yeo Mi-ran?
-Yes!

902
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:12,913
Why did she stare at me?

903
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:14,331
I'm not the celebrity.

904
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:26,009
Hello!

905
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:27,594
Hello, how have you been?

906
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:32,474
Oh, hello.

907
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:34,560
-Have you been well?
-Yes!

908
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:40,023
-Sorry?
-Do you remember me?

909
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:43,277
Of course!

910
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,404
Ji… yeon.

911
00:47:46,738 --> 00:47:48,198
-Am I right?
-Oh my God, yes!

912
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:50,409
Oh, he's buying lunch today.

913
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:52,035
-Really?
-Are you?

914
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:53,537
Let's all eat together.

915
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:55,622
Okay! Thank you!

916
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:56,832
-Well, then.
-Okay!

917
00:48:00,836 --> 00:48:02,588
You remember their names too?

918
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:04,798
What was her last name?

919
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:07,634
-Oh my!
-I'm okay!

920
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:09,219
Jang Ji-yeon?

921
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:10,679
Jeon Ji-yeon?

922
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:12,764
-No.
-Hi, everyone.

923
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:15,434
-Oh.
-Hi.

924
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:17,686
-Hi.
-He's a client here?

925
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:21,398
Her goal is to get a rich man anyway.
Why does she even work?

926
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:23,233
So she can be worth more?

927
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:25,903
So she can be worth more and more
and sell herself

928
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:27,571
to the man who pays the most!

929
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:30,073
Yeah, well,

930
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:33,243
that's what every woman dreams of.

931
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:36,288
If only he hadn't smiled like that,

932
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:38,332
I might have held back.
