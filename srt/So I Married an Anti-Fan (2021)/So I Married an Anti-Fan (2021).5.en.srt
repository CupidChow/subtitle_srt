00:00:57,370 --> 00:00:59,570
-Geun-young.
-Stop calling me!

11
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,990
But you didn't throw away the shoes.

12
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:07,930
Yes, those were limited-edition.
It'd be a shame to throw them away.

13
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,160
Okay?

14
00:01:13,610 --> 00:01:16,640
What's going on? You two were acquainted?

15
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,900
Hey, Who-joon. It's nothing.
Don't mind it.

16
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:33,320
So you two were acquaintances?

17
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:35,690
Why? Jealous?

18
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:37,670
Jealous, my foot.

19
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:41,110
I was wondering how it feels
for you to get caught

20
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,509
with something you wanted to hide.

21
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,009
Mind your own business.

22
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,660
Mind my own what? Stop bossing me around.
Only I get to do that.

23
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,330
Why can't I do it if you can?

24
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,960
And when did I? That was the first time!

25
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:52,720
All of you show up trying to knock me out!

26
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,039
Do I seem like a pushover?

27
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:58,530
-This is so annoying.
-Hey. Hey! I was just joking. Hey!

28
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,390
That was a joke. Why is she so sensitive?

29
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:09,400
And I didn't boss you around...
Well, bossing people can be offensive.

30
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,510
That was my bad.

31
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,700
Taxi!

32
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:43,230
-Wasn't marketing the problem?
-What?

33
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:47,370
You should want to do as well as we did.
The Producing Team did a sloppy job.

34
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:50,980
A sloppy job?
We went months without sleeping.

35
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,440
Everyone spends months up
before releasing an album.

36
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:57,050
The dance was a problem too.
There was nothing catchy about it.

37
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:00,130
Find me a good rhythm,
then you won't find a boring dance.

38
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:04,840
At least take a look at Who-joon's album
and performance to try to copy it.

39
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,870
-That's Who-joon.
-We can't compare with him.

40
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,850
-They're not the same.
-It can't happen.

41
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,880
-Try to do better, then.
-Come on.

42
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,060
Enough!

43
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,620
You're all good at insulting me
to my face, aren't you?

44
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:24,460
I sang the actual song,
and I haven't said a word about it.

45
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:27,280
I confirmed everything in the final step,

46
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,829
yet I sucked it up quietly
and admitted to my failure.

47
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:34,760
Let's try to do better next time.
I have high expectations.

48
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,400
-Yes, sir.
-We'll work harder.

49
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,579
Goodness.

50
00:03:40,079 --> 00:03:41,710
Long time no see, everyone.

51
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:02,080
-What brings you here?
-Of course, it's because Dad sent me.

52
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:04,190
Do you think I want to be here?

53
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,040
You came a very long way.

54
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:11,850
Father asked me
if I know why he named you Jae-joon.

55
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:12,290
(CEO Choi Jae-joon)

56
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:14,840
"Jae" means wealth,
and "Joon" means brilliance.
(CEO Choi Jae-joon)

57
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:18,399
You were literally named
to be brilliant when it comes to wealth.

58
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,250
So I told him this.

59
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:26,680
"Father, when it comes to money,
some are brilliant with it,"

60
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,440
"yet some are hopeless with it."

61
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,550
"So when someone is hopeless
with everything he does,

62
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,350
"he'll be hopeless with everything."

63
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,760
This is when we say
you don't live up to your name.

64
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:40,580
I'm sure he also regrets

65
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,530
letting you build this company.

66
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,400
Is that girl still a part of your agency?

67
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:54,750
In order to be brilliant with wealth,

68
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,620
you need to know what you should keep
and what you should throw out.

69
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,350
Aren't you going to practice?

70
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:12,130
If you're on your phone all the time,
I'll take it away.

71
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,990
You just gave it back to me.

72
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,420
Who-joon has always done well,
and now I'm doing well too.

73
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,960
Why are you so sensitive?

74
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:25,500
When we play golf,
we often say we must be extra careful

75
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:29,070
when everything
seems to be going smoothly.

76
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:32,540
You still have a long way to go.
Doing well, my foot.

77
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,159
-Joon.
-Oh, hey.

78
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,850
You're here. Go back to the practice room.

79
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,130
When will he stop nagging at me like this?

80
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:43,630
Go do your best.

81
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,570
Do your best.

82
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:55,159
Goodness, you must be tired. Great work.

83
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:00,310
But there's one more thing
on your schedule. I'm sorry.

84
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,860
One more thing? What is it?

85
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:07,430
Hey, do you remember that guy?
The youngest of BM Group.

86
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:11,970
That Ho-deok or whatever
who plays the guitar?

87
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:14,740
Yes, today is his birthday.

88
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:20,110
The chairman gave me a call himself
and asked you to stop by.

89
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:24,070
I mean, they're going to release
a new motorcycle model,

90
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,570
and he's thinking of asking you
to be the model.

91
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:31,460
Don't you make me do enough businesses?
I have to be at a high school kid's party?

92
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:34,409
I mean, he's a huge fan of yours.

93
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:37,970
Just think of this as something you do
for a fan's sake.

94
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,960
Then I'll just go celebrate
and don't take that ad gig.

95
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:42,810
Are you crazy?
Do you know how much you'd get?

96
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,110
Even if he's a high school kid,
he'd know I'm only there for the ad.

97
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,610
I can't sit there looking oblivious.

98
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:49,230
Try to make some sense, okay?

99
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:53,550
Just do this for him.

100
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,190
-You're way too greedy. Too greedy.
-Hey.

101
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:57,940
-I'm not going.
-Hey.

102
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,890
You got your big break,
so cut our agency some slack too.

103
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,480
You'll go, right?

104
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:06,300
I know you'll go. You're a nice kid.

105
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,120
He'll go, right?

106
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,980
He will. I know he will.

107
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:14,620
-I like white meat.
-You do?

108
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:19,810
This could've been really bad.
I like skin and dark meat.

109
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:23,460
I was worried you might like the same,
so I wondered if I should start liking...

110
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:24,650
What's with those two?

111
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,610
You're here. The two chicken lovers are
having a lovey-dovey conversation.

112
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,990
Then let's divide it up
into the parts we each like.

113
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:32,970
No, why? We have a lot of chicken here.

114
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:35,340
Hey, what's with you?

115
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:39,350
I had an eventful day.

116
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:41,330
Why are you wearing slippers?

117
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,280
You should go first.

118
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:50,170
You don't have to wait
while I hang with kids.

119
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:51,840
But you didn't want to come.

120
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,520
I'd rather sit here with an empty head.

121
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,980
Okay, then.
I'll pick you up when it's over. call me.

122
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:58,360
Forget it. I'll get myself home.

123
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,600
-Night.
-Hey, but I...

124
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:11,200
♫ What are you doing?
Come here and look at me ♫

125
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:13,710
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

126
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:19,080
♫ What are you doing?
Someone come and stop me ♫

127
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:33,820
You should party some more.

128
00:08:33,909 --> 00:08:35,230
Why aren't you having fun?

129
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:39,890
Hey, you kids have
a sound way of partying.

130
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:42,360
Come on, did you think
we'd smoke and drink?

131
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,100
I want to be a top star like you,
so I can't get in any trouble.

132
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:51,420
If you're too afraid to do anything
in order to be a top star,

133
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,090
then why would you want to be one?

134
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,450
You either have to be very strong
or be able to give up everything.

135
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,040
If you can't do that, don't get into it.

136
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:02,460
Which one are you?

137
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,380
Well, me?

138
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,940
I was told by your dad to come
and offered me an ad,

139
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:11,350
and I'm here now.

140
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,740
Am I strong-willed or did I just give up?

141
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,830
Let's say I'm the strong guy today.

142
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,290
I won't take the ad.
I'll just celebrate your birthday and go.

143
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,890
Then you aren't strong.
It means you only act like you are.

144
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:26,130
You're a big boy now.

145
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:31,630
This is why I like you.

146
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,330
I can be casual with you,
like a real brother.

147
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:44,480
In Korea, people say
you learn to drink soju from your father.

148
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:49,540
But I'm learning to drink soju from you.

149
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:53,850
I'm so glad I have you in my life.

150
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,310
What was that?

151
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:58,470
Let's go party.

152
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:00,720
I don't need to party. You go have fun.

153
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:04,770
Why the heck am I here anyway?

154
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:08,810
Anyway, Shin-hyuk.
Didn't you say you're going back to study?

155
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,410
Yes, I should go.

156
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:15,060
Right, let's grab a drink next time
at the rooftop.

157
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,250
Okay.

158
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:18,490
-Bye.
-Goodbye, then.

159
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:20,520
-See you later.
-Okay.

160
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:27,650
Hey, so you left those shoes
in front of Roy's restaurant?

161
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:30,590
Those weren't my size anyway.

162
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,660
Those shoes were
worn by a woman in the wrong size,

163
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,690
then got slammed into a top star's face,

164
00:10:34,770 --> 00:10:36,750
and lastly, abandoned
in front of Roy's restaurant.

165
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:40,630
Gosh, those shoes also have
such an eventful life.

166
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:46,960
Hey, isn't that eventful preview

167
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:48,240
that show you'll be on?

168
00:10:48,330 --> 00:10:51,890
(I'm the one who knows his true nature,
and who can expose the truth!)

169
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,090
This lady hates me
because of this misunderstanding,

170
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,110
but I will embrace her first.
(But will the big man, Who-joon,
embrace his anti-fan too?)

171
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:56,200
but I will embrace her first.

172
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,130
(The awesome Joon embraces his anti-fan.)
but I will embrace her first.

173
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,970
("So I married the Anti-Fan")

174
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:01,260
(Living with an enemy?
A marriage with an enemy!)

175
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:01,570
(The first person who shocked
the strong-minded Who-joon many times is)

176
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:03,590
(I think she's the first person
who shocked me so many times in a day.)
(The first person who shocked
the strong-minded Who-joon many times is)

177
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:03,730
(I think she's the first person
who shocked me so many times in a day.)

178
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:04,560
(none other than this woman?)
(I think she's the first person
who shocked me so many times in a day.)

179
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:04,780
(Now, shall we go, Geun-young?)
(none other than this woman?)
(I think she's the first person
who shocked me so many times in a day.)

180
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:04,870
(Now, shall we go, Geun-young?)

181
00:11:04,870 --> 00:11:05,930
(Exchanging...)
(Now, shall we go, Geun-young?)

182
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:09,840
(I'll be a gentle driver.)

183
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,340
(remarks)
(I'll be a gentle driver.)

184
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:11,730
(Their sweet marriage began...)

185
00:11:11,730 --> 00:11:13,100
(You're going a little too fast.)
(Their sweet marriage began...)

186
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,640
(Step on the brake.)
(Or did it?)

187
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:15,830
(Stop the car!)

188
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:16,620
Wow. From the preview,

189
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,730
(What on earth happened to them?)
Wow. From the preview,

190
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:21,020
Wow. From the preview,

191
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,780
you seem very evil, Geun-young.

192
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:28,760
Those jerks at the TV station.
Is this the infamous evil editing?

193
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,690
Fine, give them a chance with the preview,

194
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:36,200
but if the actual show is like that,
you should sue them.

195
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:37,650
I have a friend at a law firm.

196
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:42,660
This is why we say those who are on TV
and those who make the TV are the same.

197
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,000
I can't believe those jerks.

198
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,530
Could we have some more sauce?

199
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,160
Sure, one second, please.

200
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,770
(The door is opened.)

201
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:17,820
(The door is locked.)

202
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,910
(At the very least,)

203
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:26,440
(I still had my pride.)

204
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:29,960
(That was)

205
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,530
(the only limited edition I had.)

206
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:46,950
-Grab a seat.
-Okay.

207
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,900
What is it?
You suddenly wanted to see me here?

208
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,060
Do you remember this place?

209
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:55,400
You threw me a party here six years ago.

210
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:59,360
Welcome to the celebration
of Ms. Oh In-hyung's debut.

211
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,890
I was recently reminded of that day
very often.

212
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:10,050
That's why I prepared everything.

213
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,690
-You still remember that day.
-Of course, I do.

214
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:19,860
I thought you forgot.

215
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:29,760
I was very happy back then.

216
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,390
-You were?
-I want to go back to that day

217
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,820
with my work and my relationship with you.

218
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,700
Okay.

219
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:49,210
And I don't know what you saw on that day,

220
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,280
but I just ran into him by chance.

221
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,490
Even if I run into him again,
we aren't in any relationship anyway.

222
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:08,480
He's just a guy who's in my memories.
That's all he means to me.

223
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:12,920
Relationship. A guy.

224
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:20,090
You still feel awkward
to mention Joon's name to me.

225
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:25,640
That's because
you still find him uncomfortable.

226
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,850
Do you know what our problem is?

227
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:36,680
It's that you and I both
can't seem to get over that guy, Joon.

228
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,120
No. Our problem is

229
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:50,100
that I can never talk about our memories
because of Joon.

230
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,900
I'm done with this.

231
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:12,500
Where are you going?

232
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,610
Get in the car. Let's go home and talk.

233
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:16,110
Let me go.

234
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:19,630
I'm sick and tired
of trying to work this out.

235
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,280
Get in the car, will you?

236
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:25,870
Just say that you're sick of me!

237
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:31,950
Is that what you wanted?
You were waiting for me to end this first?

238
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,940
Why do I always have to be...

239
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,600
What are you doing?
There are people around here.

240
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,940
I can't believe this.

241
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,590
-You should go.
-What?

242
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:52,450
Hey, In-hyung.

243
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,650
Get in the car.

244
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,740
Hey!

245
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,080
Darn it!

246
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:08,330
So? Is this another coincidence?

247
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:11,460
I was going to pass by,

248
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,890
but I didn't want you to be humiliated
by other people.

249
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,840
What the heck are you saying?

250
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:20,340
Man, I can't believe this.

251
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,340
Please!

252
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,800
That's enough, okay?

253
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:28,620
It's really hard for me

254
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,120
to see you like this.

255
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,640
What's hard for you?

256
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:41,600
I see. Did you want
to show yourself off that badly?

257
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,980
Even in front of an ex-girlfriend
you abandoned?

258
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,660
Listen up, Jae-joon.

259
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:54,270
I never abandoned her.

260
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:57,660
If you keep treating her like this,

261
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:01,480
I might take her back.

262
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,800
"Take her back"?

263
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:13,140
If you didn't abandon her,
then what was that?

264
00:17:15,829 --> 00:17:17,060
Good luck, then.

265
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:59,390
Just you wait.

266
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:03,350
I'll make sure I reveal every little thing

267
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,350
on your favorite singer.

268
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,960
Man, this is one freaking huge house.

269
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:23,460
(My door: The bell is ringing.)

270
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,820
Why is he here again?
(My door: The bell is ringing.)

271
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,800
(My door: The bell is ringing.)

272
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:33,180
You don't even eat tteokbokki.
Why do you keep getting this?

273
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,480
People say

274
00:18:41,670 --> 00:18:43,390
there's no such thing as bad tteokbokki.

275
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:45,320
Of course, there's bad tteokbokki.

276
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:51,170
When I was younger,
my mother ran a tteokbokki place.

277
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:54,560
She said everyone said she should
run a business since when she was a kid.

278
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:58,610
But she never thought about
how no one told her to cook.

279
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:02,130
Her business
heroically went under with the review,

280
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,330
"It's tough for tteokbokki
to be this bad."

281
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,100
She still has no idea why it failed.

282
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:10,670
So who said that
there's no such thing as bad tteokbokki?

283
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:14,190
This person
who really loves tteokbokki did.

284
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:16,520
I see.

285
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:23,070
Do you get into fights?

286
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,290
You should put this on.

287
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:54,050
Your hands can punch someone,

288
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:56,510
but they're unable to put a bandage on.

289
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:25,770
Who is it?

290
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,450
(Flower delivery.)

291
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,850
Are you Ms. Oh In-hyung?
Could you sign here, please?

292
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:44,910
Thank you.

293
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:57,450
(From JJ)

294
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:00,000
(Don't be mad. You may call me a coward,)
(From JJ)

295
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:00,090
(From JJ)

296
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:01,320
(but I still can't let you go.)
(From JJ)

297
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,450
Did you have

298
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,920
something you wanted to protect?

299
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,270
You're drunk.

300
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,200
Something I wanted to protect?

301
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:52,360
Of course, I did.

302
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:58,390
I wanted to keep my love life
and my career.

303
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:01,780
But you took my career away.

304
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:05,780
And those pink pants took my love life.

305
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:12,430
But why? Why do you suddenly ask
such a sentimental question?

306
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:15,600
Just because.

307
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,260
I couldn't do that.

308
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:23,430
Everyone wants to protect
something that belongs to them.

309
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:26,900
But there comes a time
when you can't do that.

310
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:34,740
Then you might get another chance
to protect it again.

311
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,620
And you'll find
something else to protect too.

312
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,170
Finding something else to protect?

313
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,470
That's nice.

314
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:58,060
I've never managed to protect anyone.

315
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:01,310
Not my mom, not my friend,

316
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:04,220
or my love.

317
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,230
You asked why I keep getting tteokbokki
even though I don't eat it.

318
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,850
There was this girl.

319
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:25,820
There's no such thing as bad tteokbokki.

320
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:29,910
(She said there is
no such thing as bad tteokbokki.)

321
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:35,450
She could never pass by
a tteokbokki place without a bite.

322
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:40,510
She was such a simple girl
who never wanted anything big.

323
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:47,330
But I couldn't protect her.

324
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:55,340
My gosh. What am I saying to you?

325
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,710
You are asleep, aren't you?

326
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:17,530
(Joon, we're clearing up your schedule
since you'll have to be in Japan anyway.)

327
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:22,110
(The person who looked into this said
your dad's acquaintance is in Japan.)

328
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,300
(YAMA)

329
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:34,090
(I'm not home at the moment.)

330
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:38,010
(Please leave your message,
and I'll get back to you.)

331
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,000
(It's me.)

332
00:26:42,850 --> 00:26:45,050
(The guy who couldn't protect you, Mom.)

333
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,340
I guess...

334
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:58,340
I can't protect anybody...

335
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:03,350
because I took after him.

336
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:12,420
Both you and In-hyung, Mom.

337
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:32,920
What?

338
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:35,250
You're one cheeky brat.

339
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:38,990
I'm calling you because I finally had
something to discuss with you.

340
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:45,020
-What is it?
(-I'm trying to sign with Ms. Lee.)

341
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:47,000
You've done
a couple of shootings with her.

342
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:50,210
What do you think? Does she have
what it takes to be an entertainer?

343
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,750
She isn't any good. Stop minding her.

344
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:57,470
Which means you see some value in her.

345
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:03,230
I mean, someone just threatened me saying
he may take back one of our entertainers,

346
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:05,960
then he covered for her
as if she's in his agency.

347
00:28:06,050 --> 00:28:08,870
I mean, that just made me really scared.

348
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:11,370
So I'm trying to bring up a new kid.

349
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:14,150
Anyway, thanks for your advice.

350
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:22,330
Let's do some laundry.

351
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:24,270
How does this work?

352
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,650
I don't think he ever used this.

353
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,630
Can I be the first one to use it?

354
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:33,150
Yes, of course, master.
I've been waiting for you.

355
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:56,390
That's it.

356
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:01,620
The detergent? I already got some.

357
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:03,820
All right.

358
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:14,120
Okay, then. Strong cycle.

359
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,930
What? Come on!

360
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:36,250
Why didn't he get the machine connected?

361
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:39,680
Man, nothing in this house seems to work.

362
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:42,760
How can anyone live here?

363
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,390
My gosh, it's my day off.

364
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:51,250
Yes, Mr. Han.

365
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,630
What is it? It's our day off.

366
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:56,140
(Geun-young, it's an emergency.
Our premiere was moved up.)

367
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:57,900
(We have to do a shooting today.)

368
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:00,760
(We'll be at the penthouse first,
so come as soon as you're ready.)

369
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:02,250
You're coming here now?

370
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:05,380
I mean, you're heading over there now?

371
00:30:08,330 --> 00:30:10,570
Wait, yes. My bag.

372
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,310
Then let's move onto the next trainee.

373
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,170
No, we're done for the day.

374
00:30:21,610 --> 00:30:22,710
You may go.

375
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:28,390
Mr. Choi, I think there's a need
to form a trainee group for pre-debut.

376
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,840
We can't let them keep practicing.

377
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:32,790
I mean, there is no use
in just forming a group.

378
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,520
Try to put
some more thought into this, will you?

379
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:41,980
Aren't you leaving?

380
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,490
Yes, sir. Goodbye.

381
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,450
Yes, sir. We'll get going.

382
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,560
How long will they be this slow?

383
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:52,850
My gosh, this is so frustrating.

384
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,310
Are there any sensational new rookies?

385
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:02,140
Someone who's sensational enough
to become a threat to Who-joon.

386
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:09,260
Goodness, I ended up taking a walk
against my will.

387
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:13,620
Is this a good time for my arrival?

388
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,910
Why does he keep popping up?

389
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:23,210
Hey, we meet again.

390
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,400
-We do.
-Yes.

391
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,480
The shooting isn't easy, is it?

392
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:31,130
It's not. But I've been holding out

393
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,940
thanks to the vitamin pills you gave me.

394
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,340
My pleasure.

395
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:37,860
See you around, then.

396
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,840
Why would I see you again?

397
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,560
-Hey, Ji-hyang.
-Hey, Hee-gun.

398
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:43,100
-Good work, man.
-Of course.

399
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:44,290
You're here.

400
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:47,500
-Hello.
-Hey, my brother.

401
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:59,290
(Goodness, look at them.
What are those men doing?)

402
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:01,100
Those attention-needy boys.

403
00:32:01,930 --> 00:32:03,650
Look at her eyes.
She'll stab me with those.

404
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,450
Am I bleeding from my head?

405
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,520
What brings you here?

406
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:09,320
I stopped by to say hi.

407
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:11,300
You don't really look well.

408
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:14,120
No, I'm fine.
I just couldn't sleep well last night.

409
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,790
It must be tough.

410
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:19,050
Can you publish an article
when the show premieres?

411
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:23,580
Don't worry. I already know
your partner isn't an ordinary woman.

412
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:29,300
You really look worn out.
Shouldn't you get a facial or something?

413
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:30,840
I don't. I'm shining brightly.

414
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:35,500
Do you have anybody here?
Where's your makeup artist?

415
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:39,150
Please make Geun-young look
absolutely stunning.

416
00:32:39,550 --> 00:32:40,650
Okay.

417
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:45,750
Geun-yong, you don't do
any skin care at home, do you?

418
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:48,260
Oh no, this is really bad.

419
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:51,520
Kang-yeon, you must feel like
you're putting makeup on the sand, right?

420
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:55,480
Goodness, Geun-young. I'm sorry.
I'm bad at empty talks.

421
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:59,220
Goodness, Ms. No. You're impossible.

422
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:02,080
People will feel less offended
if you didn't say

423
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:03,750
-you're bad at empty talks.
-Exactly.

424
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,710
Ms. No, people probably told you
to shut your mouth pretty often.

425
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:13,390
You're right. It's better to stay silent
in this field if it isn't an empty talk.

426
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,110
Kang-yeon, you're hilarious. Goodness.

427
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,750
Please make her look pretty.

428
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,180
-Hey.
-How's everything coming?

429
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:27,110
Why are you staring at me?

430
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:31,290
Mind your business.

431
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:33,710
Your eyes should mind your business too.

432
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:37,940
Whose is this?
I found it in the utility room.

433
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:39,920
It's someone's laundry.

434
00:33:40,090 --> 00:33:41,590
Man, someone should wash these soon.

435
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,480
Goodness, Mr. Han. Where did you find it?

436
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:44,930
It was yours, Geun-young.

437
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:47,570
Goodness, I brought it from home.

438
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,910
-My washing machine is...
-Nonexistent.

439
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:56,550
-Yes.
-So you wanted to wash those here.

440
00:33:57,120 --> 00:33:59,850
But the machine isn't connected to water.

441
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,040
Exactly.

442
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,580
What?

443
00:34:05,570 --> 00:34:06,930
-It's not?
-No.

444
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:09,310
I see it isn't.

445
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:13,090
Then I had no reason
to bring that heavy bag here.

446
00:34:13,179 --> 00:34:15,730
-My gosh.
-You did that for nothing.

447
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:18,550
This place doesn't seem adequate
for a person to live.

448
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:20,400
-No.
-Yes, there's nothing here.

449
00:34:20,489 --> 00:34:22,949
Everything seems cold.

450
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,400
Let's get ready.

451
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,480
That was close.

452
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:33,730
All right.

453
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:38,350
We're going to look around
and see what we need in this house.

454
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,590
We looked around,
and there's nothing here.

455
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:43,370
It's also pretty dirty
since we left it as is after the shooting.

456
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:46,620
Really? Then we can wipe the floor too.

457
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,469
-Let's do that.
-Is that all right?

458
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,320
Let's get started, then.

459
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,810
-Go get ready.
-Yes, sir.

460
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,969
Let's get ready.

461
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,380
Please get moving.

462
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,580
Over here.

463
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:02,770
I told you not to let anyone find out.

464
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,700
Why did you leave your laundry there?

465
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:07,520
The washing machine didn't work,
so I left it. How did he find it?

466
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:09,980
Then what about sweeping the place?

467
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:12,320
I always sweep and wipe this huge place.

468
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,500
Be quiet.

469
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:16,500
I can't scrub, mop, or whatever,
so you're on your own. Okay?

470
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:19,000
-Give me an answer.
-You told me to be quiet.

471
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,880
Do you know how to do this?

472
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:31,280
Of course. I've always done this by myself
since when I was a kid.

473
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:34,270
I won't back out from doing this
just because I'm an entertainer.

474
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,640
I'll show you.

475
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:39,380
And I'm rather crafty for an entertainer.

476
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:44,350
That's not what I meant.
I can't let you do something this tough.

477
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:49,540
(He always manages to make himself
look good. That two-faced man.)

478
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:55,920
I can't believe you're even crafty.

479
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:59,700
That's why people say you're Mr. Perfect.

480
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:02,260
Then I'll go mop the place.

481
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:04,100
I'm very good at that.

482
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:25,710
Kang-yeon, did you have any space to sit
in the midst of all those clothes?

483
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,820
I didn't.

484
00:36:29,010 --> 00:36:32,090
We should clean this up
while he's shooting.

485
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:38,820
Let's sit. Sit down.

486
00:36:59,720 --> 00:36:59,810
(Devil)

487
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:02,100
(Make sure you wipe everything clean.)
(Devil)

488
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,090
Are you still working on...

489
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:43,410
I'm sorry, Geun-young.

490
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:46,930
I get really immersed
whenever I'm focused on something.

491
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:49,880
Are you sure
you're doing everything right?

492
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:53,790
It took me a while to figure out
what's wrong with the machine,

493
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,420
but I already had the answer.

494
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:59,340
I'm very thrilled to know that
I can do something for you.

495
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,770
Anyway, did you just mop the place?

496
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,660
Why didn't you wait for me?

497
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,810
I'm grateful for the offer.

498
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,920
But you couldn't do anything like this.

499
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:13,640
This is my expertise.

500
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:15,660
It's perfect for me, actually.

501
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:17,290
-Please continue.
-Okay.

502
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:19,360
You might pull your neck muscle.

503
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,940
Don't work too hard.

504
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:28,380
Should I look a little this way?

505
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:29,650
Yes, this is wonderful.

506
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:30,840
Okay.

507
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:47,430
Director, does this go in here?

508
00:38:53,850 --> 00:38:56,580
(You jerk. You evil man. You psycho.
You moron. You cheap jerk.)

509
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:58,740
That moron. That cheap jerk.

510
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:36,710
Look, there's a room here.

511
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:40,050
I should clean this room too.

512
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,700
Where are you going?

513
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:45,730
You have a huge place,
so I'm taking a tour.

514
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:47,930
Do not go up on the second floor.

515
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:50,830
What kind of obscene stuff
did you hide up there?

516
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:07,020
Don't do it when I tell you not to.

517
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,410
Geun-young!

518
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,420
Geun-young.

519
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,600
I finally succeeded.
Do you want to go see it?

520
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,370
Let me clean this room before we go.

521
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,790
No, I want to show it to you now.

522
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,080
Let me just finish up the second floor.

523
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:30,830
I'm not done with this yet.
I need to clean the second floor...

524
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,160
It's all right.
I want you to see this right now.

525
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,400
There's no need to be surprised.
It's all right.

526
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:40,730
This was a piece of cake.

527
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,420
He did it.

528
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:51,820
(Cut! Okay. Looks great.)

529
00:40:51,950 --> 00:40:53,660
(Let's call it a day.)

530
00:40:53,750 --> 00:40:55,470
We'll call it a day, now. It's an okay.

531
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:56,610
Great work.

532
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:57,980
-Sure.
-Great work today.

533
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,000
Great work.

534
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,330
Let's start cleaning up.

535
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:07,740
My gosh, that almost killed me.

536
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,940
His entire life is staged.

537
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:18,080
Ra-ra, they'll be done
with the shooting soon.

538
00:41:18,790 --> 00:41:21,380
This is weird. Where did it go?

539
00:41:21,470 --> 00:41:22,570
What are you looking for?

540
00:41:22,970 --> 00:41:25,520
-That white one.
-This one?

541
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:27,900
No, a T-shirt. A white T-shirt.

542
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:30,800
How did this get in here?

543
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:33,130
I'm so sorry. I thought it was mine.

544
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:35,990
I can't help it. I'll pay them for this.

545
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,680
You make all kinds of trouble.

546
00:41:42,110 --> 00:41:43,870
Ra-ra, let me pay for that.

547
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,770
-Baby, don't say that.
-How much is it?

548
00:41:48,090 --> 00:41:50,600
-I'll give you 30 dollars later...
-300 dollars?

549
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:53,370
Come on, what's with everyone?

550
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:55,920
It's originally 1,000 dollars,

551
00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:58,830
but since Who-joon wore it,
it'd go up to 3,000 dollars.

552
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:03,890
What? Why would this simple T-shirt
cost anybody 3,000 dollars?

553
00:42:03,970 --> 00:42:05,070
-Ms. No.
-What?

554
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,920
How can it cost 3,000 dollars?

555
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:09,300
This is just a shirt.
Is it that expensive?

556
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:13,480
It's because of you.
You're a luxurious brand of your own.

557
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:19,550
Why did you speak up?
You should've just stayed quiet.

558
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:22,500
I was told to mop the floor,
so I just took...

559
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:24,920
Be quiet and go do the laundry.

560
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:26,410
They smell gross.

561
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,910
Geun-young, don't worry.
Ra-ra and I'll look into it.

562
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:35,520
-It's okay.
-I'm so sorry. Oh no.

563
00:42:36,530 --> 00:42:38,210
I really thought it was mine.

564
00:42:38,290 --> 00:42:39,390
It's okay.

565
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:43,440
Should I try getting that dry-cleaned?

566
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:47,710
That shirt? No, it's okay. It's all right.

567
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,030
Wait, I...

568
00:42:52,070 --> 00:42:55,320
Look, I think that's the preview
for the variety show Who-joon is doing.

569
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:58,310
That reporter is pretty feisty.

570
00:42:58,930 --> 00:43:00,950
She's already
like a variety show personality.

571
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:17,540
Come on. They still have a long way to go.

572
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:30,700
Is Who-joon gone?

573
00:43:30,790 --> 00:43:32,240
Yes, he just left.

574
00:43:32,330 --> 00:43:36,070
Could you keep this with you,
then give it to him later?

575
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:38,930
-What is this?
-I found it below his car.

576
00:43:39,010 --> 00:43:40,730
I forgot to give it to him.

577
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:43,550
-I'm sorry. Please do that for me.
-Sure.

578
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:45,920
What's in this? Why is it so soft?

579
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,010
My gosh!

580
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,840
That means he used this house to...

581
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:32,430
(I'm sure something is in this room.)

582
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,850
You can just punch in the passcode.
Why do you ring the bell?

583
00:44:46,110 --> 00:44:49,320
Then why do you open the door
without asking who I am?

584
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:54,380
Why do you keep looking at me like that?

585
00:44:55,310 --> 00:44:58,210
I'm wondering why you come here so often
even though this isn't your place.

586
00:44:58,430 --> 00:45:00,590
I have no business with you,
so mind your own.

587
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:05,690
Of course.
Your business is somewhere else.

588
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:21,180
He's probably
looking for this desperately.

589
00:45:37,370 --> 00:45:40,320
I have no business with you.
What do you want? What?

590
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:45,290
Are you looking for this?
Your eyes are completely bloodshot.

591
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:48,110
-What is this?
-It's yours. Stop pretending.

592
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:51,140
Is this a gift? I don't want it.

593
00:45:51,230 --> 00:45:55,410
-A gift? My gosh. You pervert.
-What?

594
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:58,360
You shouldn't bring this to the shooting.

595
00:45:58,450 --> 00:46:01,350
You should be grateful
that I got to see this first.

596
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:05,530
If you dropped this outside,
what on earth do you do at home?

597
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:07,250
I think it came from that room.

598
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:08,920
What the heck is in here?

599
00:46:12,530 --> 00:46:13,720
Gosh, what is this?

600
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:18,380
You've become even better at acting.

601
00:46:18,470 --> 00:46:22,120
What do you think?
A part of your collection, obviously.

602
00:46:24,410 --> 00:46:27,660
You. Do you have evidence
that these are mine?

603
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:30,520
Are those mine, then? Or Ms. No, maybe?

604
00:46:30,610 --> 00:46:32,020
Should we leave it at that?

605
00:46:32,330 --> 00:46:37,430
Hey, Geun-young. I beg you.
Don't ever be a reporter in the next life.

606
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:40,160
Why don't you ever check the facts?

607
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:48,910
Well, I guess it's not that easy to admit
that you're a pervert.

608
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:54,680
(Hey, it's the universe's biggest star.
Why are you video calling?)

609
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:00,750
Do you know anything about this?

610
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:03,920
(That? It's from a fan.
I got it while you were shooting.)

611
00:47:04,010 --> 00:47:06,120
(I was going to throw it out.
Why do you have it?)

612
00:47:06,210 --> 00:47:08,010
(I heard it was women's underwear.)

613
00:47:08,140 --> 00:47:11,710
(You know, like how crazy fans throw
their underwear during your shows.)

614
00:47:11,790 --> 00:47:15,400
Some might take this the wrong way
and think I'm a pervert.

615
00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:20,110
(Exactly. Ra-ra was going to throw it away
before you saw it and got offended.)

616
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,960
(Leave it there. I'll throw it out later.)

617
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:24,690
And I opened that weird parcel.

618
00:47:24,770 --> 00:47:27,110
I told you to leave it alone.
Why did you open it?

619
00:47:27,190 --> 00:47:29,260
(You never know.
It could've been something weird.)

620
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:31,730
(What if there was a dead rat inside?)

621
00:47:32,390 --> 00:47:35,860
It's just a hat. It also had a note
saying they'd love for you to wear it.

622
00:47:35,950 --> 00:47:39,210
(I'll leave it in the car later,
so you can upload a proof shot later.)

623
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:40,790
Okay, then. Goodbye.

624
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:41,980
(Okay.)

625
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:46,550
You once received a dead rat?
That sounds awful.

626
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,970
-How does it feel to get that?
-Don't change the subject.

627
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:53,810
I mean, why did he give it to me
saying that it's yours?

628
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:55,220
No wonder I took it the wrong way.

629
00:47:55,310 --> 00:47:58,300
And I didn't know that
women send you their underwear like this.

630
00:47:58,390 --> 00:48:00,900
Is claiming ignorance your main weapon?

631
00:48:01,290 --> 00:48:04,110
-You're impossible.
-Impossible?

632
00:48:04,810 --> 00:48:07,280
I can't believe you called me impossible.

633
00:48:07,370 --> 00:48:10,140
At the very least,
I'm not two-faced like this guy I know.

634
00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:11,680
Not only do you have two sides,

635
00:48:11,770 --> 00:48:14,270
but you also have a secret chamber,
like Harry Potter or whatever.

636
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:16,080
Then you can leave this place!

637
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:20,740
Although I asked you for permission
to keep my residence in secret,

638
00:48:20,830 --> 00:48:22,720
you shouldn't speak
as if this is your place.

639
00:48:22,810 --> 00:48:25,760
-This is my house.
-It is?

640
00:48:25,850 --> 00:48:27,960
If you feel offended, you can leave.

641
00:48:28,050 --> 00:48:30,690
I'll consider that done, okay?
So please just leave.

642
00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:33,370
You're unbelievably talkative. Goodness.

643
00:48:36,890 --> 00:48:38,210
This is his house?

644
00:48:39,530 --> 00:48:40,630
Really?

645
00:48:40,850 --> 00:48:42,350
(Two-faced Who-joon)

646
00:48:42,430 --> 00:48:44,020
(Tells me to shut up when he gets mad.)

647
00:48:44,110 --> 00:48:45,600
(Only acts nice for his reputation.)

648
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:47,980
When he gets angry,

649
00:48:48,110 --> 00:48:49,780
he completely ignores
what another person says.

650
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:52,330
(Completely ignores)
he completely ignores
what another person says.

651
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:54,360
You didn't even hear me out
before you got mad at me.

652
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:57,000
Hear you out? It's not my first time
running into someone like you.

653
00:48:57,080 --> 00:49:00,030
You lurked around with a camera before,
then you snuck up on me again.

654
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:01,350
Yet you want me to let it go?

655
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,730
How many times do I have to say
I didn't take any photos?

656
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:07,200
When he doesn't say anything,

657
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,050
he's saying, "Shut up."

658
00:49:09,050 --> 00:49:09,270
(Shut up.)
he's saying, "Shut up."

659
00:49:09,270 --> 00:49:09,400
(Shut up.)

660
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:10,500
(Shut up.)
(Shut up.)

661
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,700
Am I obliged to tell you that?

662
00:49:14,510 --> 00:49:18,470
He should be clinically tested
for being so attention-needy.

663
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:19,080
Attention-needy.

664
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:22,080
(Attention-needy)
Attention-needy.

665
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:22,780
(Attention-needy)

666
00:49:22,910 --> 00:49:26,480
Everyone, you'll make me really sad
if you do something like this.

667
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:30,480
This lady hates me
because of this misunderstanding,

668
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:31,760
but I will...

669
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:38,840
embrace her first.

670
00:49:42,050 --> 00:49:42,270
(Attention-needy)

671
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:43,900
Attention-needy.
(Attention-needy)

672
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:44,820
(Attention-needy)

673
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:45,920
(Two-faced Who-joon)

674
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,550
He's a master
(Two-faced Who-joon)

675
00:49:47,550 --> 00:49:49,140
He's a master

676
00:49:49,710 --> 00:49:53,360
at only making himself look great.

677
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:58,330
And letters from my fans.
Whenever I get tired and weary,

678
00:49:58,770 --> 00:50:02,200
reading these letters will
prop me right back up.

679
00:50:02,820 --> 00:50:04,010
It's my biggest treasure.

680
00:50:08,630 --> 00:50:12,150
Do not be deceived.

681
00:50:33,750 --> 00:50:37,620
-Hello?
(-Yes, is this Reporter Lee Geun-young?)

682
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:42,240
-This is she.
(-I'm calling from "Superpatch",)

683
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:44,620
(and I'm the editor in chief,
Kang Gyeong-su.)

684
00:50:47,170 --> 00:50:50,870
-What?
-This is unprecedented,

685
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:55,880
but we thought it'd be great
if we recruited you,

686
00:50:55,970 --> 00:50:58,520
so I decided to call you myself.

687
00:50:58,610 --> 00:51:03,230
(You wouldn't check your email,
so I had to make an unprecedented call.)

688
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:06,620
(This is just a formality,)

689
00:51:06,710 --> 00:51:06,840
(but could you come to our interview?)

690
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:10,180
(Announcement: This is "Superpatch.")
(but could you come to our interview?)

691
00:51:10,970 --> 00:51:12,070
It's tomorrow.

692
00:51:19,730 --> 00:51:21,530
("So I Married the Anti-Fan")

693
00:51:24,570 --> 00:51:25,670
(Or did it?)

694
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:27,740
(Stop the car!)

695
00:51:27,830 --> 00:51:29,230
(What on earth happened to them?)

696
00:51:30,470 --> 00:51:32,010
(Lee Geun-young, you witch, get lost!)

697
00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:35,260
(I hate how he's "married,"
but it's worse since she's the anti-fan.)

698
00:51:35,570 --> 00:51:36,670
(Is this real?)

699
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:38,340
(Unbelievable.)

700
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:40,450
(Stop messing with my star!)

701
00:51:40,450 --> 00:51:41,550
(Who's this?)
(Stop messing with my star!)

702
00:51:41,550 --> 00:51:41,820
(Stop messing with my star!)

703
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:42,080
(I hate this. I hate this variety show.)
(Stop messing with my star!)

704
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:42,170
(I hate this. I hate this variety show.)

705
00:51:42,170 --> 00:51:43,930
(I hate this variety show!
I'll start a petition to cancel this!)
(I hate this. I hate this variety show.)

706
00:51:43,930 --> 00:51:44,720
(I hate this variety show!
I'll start a petition to cancel this!)

707
00:52:07,510 --> 00:52:09,980
We would've met tomorrow
on our way to Japan anyway.

708
00:52:10,070 --> 00:52:12,400
What brings you to the TV station?

709
00:52:13,590 --> 00:52:14,820
Where's Mr. Han?

710
00:52:14,910 --> 00:52:18,160
We go on air while we're in Japan,
so he's busy editing.

711
00:52:19,090 --> 00:52:20,450
Did you already pack?

712
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:22,120
No, not yet.

713
00:52:22,210 --> 00:52:24,280
Why not? You don't want to go?

714
00:52:24,370 --> 00:52:25,470
Sorry?

715
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:30,000
No, that's not exactly why.

716
00:52:33,250 --> 00:52:35,670
Anyway, Ms. No.

717
00:52:37,790 --> 00:52:39,060
By any chance,

718
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:44,170
what happens if I quit now?

719
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:46,280
Well, it'll be a breach of contract,

720
00:52:46,370 --> 00:52:48,960
so you'll have to give us the front money
as compensation,

721
00:52:49,050 --> 00:52:51,380
then the show will be canceled
without an ending.

722
00:52:51,470 --> 00:52:54,110
Then Mr. Han and I will
simply be in trouble.

723
00:52:55,610 --> 00:52:58,250
I'm sorry.
Did I scare you a little too much?

724
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:01,460
Do you want to stop here?

725
00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:05,070
No, that's not what I meant.

726
00:53:05,150 --> 00:53:08,280
Why? You're doing so well right now,

727
00:53:08,370 --> 00:53:09,990
the show will be unlike the preview,

728
00:53:10,080 --> 00:53:13,690
and you'll have
lots of fun with us in Japan.

729
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:17,870
Well, that's be considered an empty talk,
which I just can't do.

730
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:20,200
Remember what Mr. Han always says?

731
00:53:20,290 --> 00:53:22,450
"If you don't want to, we can't help it."

732
00:53:22,530 --> 00:53:25,390
"The show isn't important.
What's important is your opinion."

733
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:38,590
I'll talk to the producer again.
Don't worry about it.

734
00:53:45,060 --> 00:53:46,200
Let's talk again tomorrow.

735
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:50,300
Mr. Choi,
In-hyung has a schedule tomorrow.

736
00:53:51,090 --> 00:53:52,450
Then go work.

737
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:55,140
-Bye.
-Jae-joon.

738
00:53:56,410 --> 00:53:57,510
Geun-young.

739
00:53:59,930 --> 00:54:02,920
-Who was that?
-A rookie from my agency.

740
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:05,430
She's still new. You wouldn't know her.

741
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:06,840
Oh, I see.

742
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:10,230
-I saw the date for your first episode.
-Yes.

743
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:12,250
You seem nervous.

744
00:54:13,090 --> 00:54:14,760
I'm a little worried.

745
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,100
Yes.

746
00:54:22,590 --> 00:54:23,690
Okay.

747
00:54:26,070 --> 00:54:27,170
Yes, I understand.

748
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:29,060
Let's go.

749
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:32,710
What is it? What's up?

750
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,350
I heard Geun-young can't be reached.

751
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:38,170
I can't believe what she's doing.

752
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:40,760
She needs to leave now
to catch the flight.

753
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:45,960
The production crew doesn't know
where she lives, so they're worried.

754
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,560
She's an expert
at getting on people's nerves.

755
00:54:50,710 --> 00:54:53,790
Let's stop by the penthouse on the way.
She's probably sleeping there.

756
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:56,740
What? Why would she be there?

757
00:54:56,820 --> 00:54:59,240
We'll talk as we go.
We have to hurry to stop by there.

758
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:21,460
Geun-young.

759
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:27,050
Geun-young.

760
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:38,140
Hey, I don't think she's here either.
I'll come down for now.

761
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:45,270
I've been appreciating
everything you have done to this day.

762
00:55:45,350 --> 00:55:49,180
Thank you.
If you give me a chance, I'll do my best.

763
00:55:49,270 --> 00:55:53,360
If you decide to take the job,
can you begin right away?

764
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:58,860
Yes, well, as you know,
I'm involved in this TV show.

765
00:55:58,950 --> 00:56:01,720
But since I'm a reporter,
I'll quit right away.

766
00:56:01,810 --> 00:56:04,410
No, what are you saying?

767
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:06,910
What you're doing is
investigative reporting.

768
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:08,100
Sorry?

769
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:14,700
You're investigating for the truth
in the dirty world of entertainment.

770
00:56:14,970 --> 00:56:17,520
That's the biggest strength you have,

771
00:56:17,610 --> 00:56:20,600
the biggest strength of your career,
so you should make use of that.

772
00:56:21,430 --> 00:56:24,780
You can enjoy your shooting with Who-joon,

773
00:56:24,870 --> 00:56:28,250
then try to fish for information.

774
00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:31,510
So find out his other side off the camera.

775
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:35,600
You know, his love scandal, or whatever.
Bring everything you find out.

776
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:38,460
Once you bring us that information,

777
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:40,620
we'll recruit you.

778
00:56:42,030 --> 00:56:44,490
It's your chance
to report on a big exclusive.

779
00:56:44,890 --> 00:56:45,990
Right?

780
00:56:54,520 --> 00:56:55,710
They're here now.

781
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:02,400
Have you heard from Geun-young yet?

782
00:57:02,490 --> 00:57:04,730
Rookie, did he contact you?

783
00:57:04,820 --> 00:57:07,810
Actually, she asked what would happen
if she quits here.

784
00:57:07,900 --> 00:57:09,390
I think she meant it.

785
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:11,200
So what did she say?

786
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,440
I haven't heard the rest.

787
00:57:15,030 --> 00:57:16,740
Then let's wait for her
just a little longer.

788
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:19,910
But I don't see Ms. No either.

789
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:23,250
She went inside earlier
to get some makeup.

790
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,410
She wants to be prettier, I guess.

791
00:57:26,950 --> 00:57:28,050
Let's wait here a little.

792
00:57:30,250 --> 00:57:32,320
Take a seat for a bit.

793
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:39,580
We might have to leave by ourselves.

794
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:49,350
(Employment Contract)

795
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:52,290
Why don't we sign the paperwork today?

796
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:29,300
(Employment Contract)

797
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:50,640
(Employment Contract)

798
00:59:00,230 --> 00:59:02,690
(Employment Contract)

799
00:59:08,190 --> 00:59:09,510
I don't want to be

800
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:12,770
a two-faced person who deceives
an entertainer for information.

801
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:17,170
I guess I am still not thirsty enough
to get a huge exclusive.

802
00:59:17,740 --> 00:59:18,840
I see.

803
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:23,370
Well, then I'll wait for you.

804
00:59:24,030 --> 00:59:26,670
Okay. Give me a call when it's time.

805
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:42,380
Am I at the right place?

806
00:59:43,660 --> 00:59:45,860
Should I have said
it's my first time at the airport?

807
00:59:58,130 --> 00:59:59,760
Hey, Geun-young. Where are you?

808
01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:03,630
No, that's not the right place.
Come to the second floor.

809
01:00:04,250 --> 01:00:05,440
The second floor.

810
01:00:06,930 --> 01:00:09,660
Yes, come upstairs, then turn right.
You'll see us.

811
01:00:16,570 --> 01:00:18,420
Where am I supposed to be?

812
01:00:29,370 --> 01:00:30,950
We really can't wait anymore.

813
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:33,860
You should go first.
I'll take her on the next flight.

814
01:00:34,910 --> 01:00:36,590
We should do that, right?

815
01:00:36,670 --> 01:00:38,610
Hey, make sure you wrap up everything.

816
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:40,150
So where's Who-joon?

817
01:00:40,630 --> 01:00:41,730
What?

818
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:45,780
Where did he go?

819
01:01:06,290 --> 01:01:08,050
You're late. Start running.

820
01:02:05,690 --> 01:02:05,790
Are you two newlyweds?
