00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,010
You're late. Start running.

11
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:13,220
It must be uncomfortable.
We had to switch flights,

12
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,810
and those were the only seats.

13
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,180
And nothing in the business class?

14
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,980
Can you put your arm down?

15
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,300
Sorry.

16
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:44,600
I'm sorry we missed our flight
because of me.

17
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,150
Will you keep causing trouble?

18
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:51,240
Well, something kind of came up.

19
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,610
What was so important
that you had to stall everyone?

20
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:00,700
-I said I'm sorry.
-Exactly.

21
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:02,770
So what made you do this to feel sorry?

22
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,970
I had to hang the laundry, okay?

23
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:15,790
Fine. It couldn't have been a big deal
if you can lie about it.

24
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:20,900
But if you're going to bail like this,
just say that you're out now.

25
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,760
Why didn't you leave me behind?
Why did you let me tag along?

26
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,690
He nags way too much.

27
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,510
Are you two newlyweds?

28
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,240
We were like that when we were your age.

29
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:36,650
Ma'am, we aren't in any relationship.

30
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:39,290
We were like them once, remember?

31
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:42,590
I don't understand
why we fought so much back then.

32
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:47,910
We aren't like you two.

33
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,870
How come In-hyung went to Japan alone?

34
00:03:58,950 --> 00:04:03,000
Well, I said I'd follow her,

35
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,950
but she felt bad for taking her manager
since she's just an extra.

36
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:09,560
Yes, so I asked why is she in Japan?

37
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:10,920
To shoot an ad.

38
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,550
Didn't you know?

39
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,150
It's In-hyung, so I figured you knew.

40
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:17,870
An ad? What ad?

41
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:24,830
The ad for SP Group I mentioned before.

42
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:27,550
They just needed anybody to come,

43
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:30,990
then In-hyung volunteered to go.

44
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,560
You didn't say you gave that gig to her.

45
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:37,370
Did you?

46
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:40,840
What's the product?
Why is it done in Japan?

47
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:43,440
It's for this coffee drink.
Who-joon is the main model.

48
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:50,790
They just needed anybody
to be there as his partner.

49
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:53,030
You didn't say

50
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,610
it's Who-joon's ad.

51
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:59,450
I was going to report back,

52
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:02,450
but you told us
to manage something like...

53
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:04,290
No, I'm sorry.

54
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:06,630
Does she know who the main model is?

55
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:08,610
Yes.

56
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:12,740
-Get out.
-Sorry?

57
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,330
Get out of here now!

58
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:18,370
I'm sorry.

59
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,620
Enjoy your meal.

60
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:45,080
Excuse me. I'm a huge fan.

61
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:46,659
Could I have an autograph?

62
00:05:47,409 --> 00:05:48,510
Sure.

63
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:56,520
Can you hold this?

64
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:07,430
Here. Thank you.

65
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,100
Aren't you going to eat?

66
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,860
You can eat that too.

67
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:22,260
Hey, I heard Who-joon had this.

68
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:24,860
We can probably sell this
at a hefty price online.

69
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:29,830
That's why top stars
never touch a thing even at a hotel.

70
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,030
It's tough to be a celebrity.

71
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,610
Did you see Who-joon?

72
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:36,520
It's tough to be that good-looking.

73
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,820
I need to use the restroom.

74
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,420
Oh no.

75
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,630
My gosh. Come on.

76
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,590
I'm sorry.

77
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:34,640
My gosh. Are you crazy?
Why didn't you lock the door?

78
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,930
Look at this. My phone.

79
00:07:38,909 --> 00:07:40,400
Man, that was shocking.

80
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:47,750
Goodness, you two don't want to stay away
even for a second, you newlyweds.

81
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,549
Goodness,
you must be tired from the travel.

82
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:35,090
Glad to have you, Geun-young.

83
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:36,900
You're finally here.

84
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:39,490
I was really anxious
that you wouldn't come.

85
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,429
Are you sure you didn't go, "Oh well"?

86
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,330
Come on, what do you think of me?

87
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,710
I went, "We won't shoot
if she doesn't come."

88
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,210
Goodness.

89
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,950
You can unpack your stuff later.

90
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:55,250
Why don't we head over there
and have a talk?

91
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:57,140
-Let's go.
-This way, please.

92
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,370
I'm sure Who-joon has been to Japan a lot,

93
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:04,570
and it's not your first time, is it?

94
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:07,610
My gosh, everyone has been to Japan.

95
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,840
It's barely foreign now.

96
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:10,200
Sounds great, then.

97
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:12,890
Geun-young, you're going to be
Who-joon's guide today.

98
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,380
-Me?
-Yes.

99
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:17,290
Who-joon, you haven't been
out on the street in Japan

100
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,530
since you were
probably only here on business.

101
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,950
-I guess.
-So today,

102
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:26,480
you're going to stroll around
like a regular tourist, not a top star.

103
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:29,560
-Doesn't that sound great?
-Don't you think people will swarm in?

104
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:33,520
No one would recognize him
if he puts on a cap and walks around.

105
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:36,600
He stands out even more
when he covers up like a celebrity.

106
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:39,460
Right. I shouldn't have said that.

107
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,780
People would think there's no way
Who-joon would be out here in the open

108
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,050
-without a disguise.
-Yes.

109
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,330
-Don't you think?
-Exactly.

110
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:47,690
Will you two go with them?

111
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,140
-We'll be behind...
-Right.

112
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:51,960
We have to go find
the next place for our shooting.

113
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,370
What? We already have...

114
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,140
-Okay, then.
-Wait, we aren't...

115
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,860
-Shall we?
-Where are Ra-ra and Kang-yeon?

116
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:04,940
We asked the advertisement staff
to help him out.

117
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,270
-I see.
-Let's go.

118
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,650
Geun-young, say hi to the camera.

119
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:14,840
Hello.

120
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:19,810
Where do you usually go first
when you're in Japan?

121
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,880
Well.

122
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:28,040
I always stop by Shibuya first.

123
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:33,010
Shibuya is in Tokyo.

124
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,300
Exactly.

125
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:40,140
I was saying
it's a shame that Shibuya isn't here.

126
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:41,330
I see.

127
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:46,260
Okay. You must come to Japan often.

128
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,760
Where should we go?

129
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:51,580
Since we're in Japan,
we should eat sushi first.

130
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:54,090
-Sushi sounds good.
-Yes.

131
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,640
Then I'll put my trust in you
and follow you.

132
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:57,870
Okay.

133
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,540
Shall we?

134
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:09,220
Darn it.

135
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,400
-Let's go.
-Okay.

136
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:17,410
I'm on a tour of good restaurants
with Geun-young.

137
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,400
Do we go this way or that way?

138
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:22,290
-That way?
-Yes.

139
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:29,150
Everything still looks the same.

140
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:32,410
I don't think this is it.

141
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:36,410
-This way?
-To the tasty restaurant.

142
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:41,650
Hey, I think it's over there.

143
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:42,840
This way?

144
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,130
Do we go down this way?

145
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:47,500
Wait, I don't think this is it.

146
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:49,610
-How much longer will it take?
-Soon enough.

147
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:52,560
Are we going back this way?

148
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:54,410
-This place must be great.
-Yes.

149
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,870
Goodness, I wonder how great it is.

150
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,590
I'm really looking forward to it.

151
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:02,200
-Where in the world...
-I thought something might be here.

152
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:05,320
She has zero sense of direction.

153
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,970
Geun-young. Geun-young?

154
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:14,210
It'd be easier to find
if we can spot something nearby.

155
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,500
Why don't we look it up on the map?

156
00:12:16,590 --> 00:12:20,810
Right. I can't seem to remember very well.

157
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,260
My gosh. I'm so sorry.

158
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:23,540
It's all right.

159
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,210
Hey, I think it's that place.

160
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,930
You said it seemed right before.

161
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:33,000
-Over there.
-That's the fourth time you said...

162
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:35,070
No, this time, it's real.

163
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:37,930
Just ask her for the name of the place.

164
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,950
She just came across that by chance.

165
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,230
Then let me try a bite.

166
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,560
Wow, this is unbelievable.

167
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,120
Hey, turn it off.

168
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,560
-Turn it off.
-Why?

169
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:15,900
Whenever you turn this off,

170
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,590
turn this one in the back off too.
Our voices are getting recorded.

171
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:24,300
You've never been to Japan, right?

172
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,340
I can tell by the way you're eating.

173
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:31,160
You sound like people
who eat sushi for the first time in Japan.

174
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,750
We walked miles to eat this? Man.

175
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,960
Whatever. I just have a big appetite.

176
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:40,400
You're right. I almost fainted in shock
when you ate two servings on the flight.

177
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:42,560
And it's your first time here, right?

178
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:44,060
Stop pretending.

179
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,990
No, I'm a regular here.

180
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:49,690
I ate that in-flight meal for your sake
to not put you in a spot.

181
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,670
For my sake? When you were done,

182
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,520
you went, "May I have two more?"

183
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:55,100
You're unbelievable.

184
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:57,170
-You weren't asleep.
-Aren't you full?

185
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:00,290
Goodness. What on earth am I doing here?

186
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:05,840
This is great.

187
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:10,680
Japan is all about local beer,

188
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:13,890
and the essence of business trips is
skipping work.

189
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,430
Yes, drink up.

190
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,340
So did you hand over our first episode?

191
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:24,010
The first episode?

192
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,520
Wait, did you edit it in a weird way
behind my back?

193
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:33,380
No, I'm sure you'd love it too.

194
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:34,570
What did you do?

195
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,850
It's a secret.

196
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,450
What did you do?
Why are you making me so curious?

197
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:44,550
If this show goes under again,
you won't see me for another ten years.

198
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:49,700
Come on. Didn't you return
because you missed those days?

199
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:58,940
I made two mistakes that day.

200
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:01,710
First, setting that dove on fire.

201
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:06,770
Second, setting the night on fire
with you.

202
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,020
I can't believe it.

203
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,800
Why is the sun so burning?
I'm going to get tanned.

204
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:14,430
Let me see. Did you get tanned?

205
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,190
Look. I already turned darker.

206
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,520
You darned sun.

207
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:22,090
Ms. No, when you get tanned,

208
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:23,580
-you'll look sexy.
-I know.

209
00:15:23,670 --> 00:15:25,740
-Very much.
-I know.

210
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,850
Why don't we head over there
and get tanned?

211
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:30,270
You have a knack
for keeping yourself in peace.

212
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,630
I hate you.

213
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:35,900
I wonder if our two heroes are in peace,

214
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:37,710
just like us.

215
00:15:41,230 --> 00:15:43,820
-Should we go in here?
-Sure.

216
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,590
There are lots of cute stuff.

217
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:48,970
There are lots of stuff.

218
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,720
-What's this?
-It's called "mikuji."

219
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:56,270
You get to pick out your fortune.
You should pick one too.

220
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,460
My fortune?

221
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,660
How is Geun-young's fortune today?

222
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,860
I have no idea what this says.

223
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:18,230
Let me see.

224
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:22,800
I see. "Full bloom."

225
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:24,260
(You're a late-blooming flower.
Your true love is before you,)

226
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:24,430
"You're a late-blooming flower.
Your true love is before you, but you..."
(You're a late-blooming flower.
Your true love is before you,)

227
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:24,520
"You're a late-blooming flower.
Your true love is before you, but you..."

228
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,050
(but you do not recognize your love,
just like a lunar eclipse.)
"You're a late-blooming flower.
Your true love is before you, but you..."

229
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:25,140
"You're a late-blooming flower.
Your true love is before you, but you..."

230
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:25,530
(You will go through
many tunnels of trials,)
"You're a late-blooming flower.
Your true love is before you, but you..."

231
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:25,620
"You're a late-blooming flower.
Your true love is before you, but you..."

232
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,150
(and tribulations
before you recognize each other.)
"You're a late-blooming flower.
Your true love is before you, but you..."

233
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:28,610
"You're a late-blooming flower.
Your true love is before you, but you..."

234
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,160
Hey, I guess you can speak some Japanese.

235
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,440
What does it say?

236
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:41,060
Well. "Even after much trouble,
you will not find your true love."

237
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:45,860
"You should continue
to choose work over love."

238
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,340
Really? Does it really say that?

239
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:50,520
Yes.

240
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:54,350
"However, if you keep this fortune strip,"

241
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,830
"you will be able to find
your true love later in life."

242
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:02,670
"But if you lose this fortune strip,
you'll never find love."

243
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:04,339
Something like that.

244
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:06,010
You have to keep it well.

245
00:17:06,099 --> 00:17:08,040
-Give it to me.
-Keep it well, okay?

246
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:09,310
-Give it to me.
-Okay?

247
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,730
-All right? Okay.
-Give it back.

248
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:15,250
What? Hey, give it back.
Come on. Give it back!

249
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:17,450
-You better keep it well.
-So give it back to me!

250
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,740
-Catch me if you can!
-Why did you take it?

251
00:17:19,829 --> 00:17:21,720
Fine, I'll give it to you.

252
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:22,910
Here, take it.

253
00:17:23,170 --> 00:17:26,210
Hey! Come on! What's with you?

254
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,630
(Jae-joon)

255
00:17:50,190 --> 00:17:52,340
Why won't she pick up?

256
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:55,120
She won't pick up her phone?

257
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:59,380
Yes, I'm unable to reach her all day long.

258
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:05,020
Anyway, what have you been
reading all day?

259
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:08,100
Gu told me that specialty crops are
very popular these days.

260
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,470
A life where nature and humans become one.

261
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,530
Enough.

262
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:13,810
-Farming is very...
-That's enough, please.

263
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:19,010
Let's just keep living like this. You are
the biggest specialty crop in our family.

264
00:18:19,090 --> 00:18:22,660
Specializing in what now?
Just grind the ink stick.

265
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:27,980
I love December Bright the most
among all of your works.

266
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:32,430
I'm a December Bright.
I can't be a part of Seotda,

267
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:35,730
and I'm not considered
as a Bright card in Go-Stop.

268
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:40,080
Today, I'm going to show you
how you do your brows.

269
00:18:40,170 --> 00:18:44,750
Now, draw your brows in a straight line.

270
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,860
-Yes, Ms. Jang?
(-Hey, Mi-jung.)

271
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:54,730
I haven't been able to reach Geun-young
all day long.

272
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,450
(Really?)

273
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:59,710
I'm not really sure either.
I haven't seen her for a few days.

274
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:02,830
For a few days?
I thought she was at your place.

275
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:06,660
Right, she's living with a senior
because of work.

276
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,730
A senior? Who?

277
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:13,570
Wait, is that little brat
living with a man?

278
00:19:14,050 --> 00:19:17,660
Ms. Jang, no. That's not the case.

279
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,390
People don't think it's a big deal
to live together before marriage,

280
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:22,540
(but you kids can't do that, okay?)

281
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:23,730
Babe, open up.

282
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,560
Yes, Ms. Jang.
I'll find out and call you back.

283
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:29,190
Goodbye. Okay.

284
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:32,490
Babe, are you okay?

285
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,610
Are you all right? I'm sorry.

286
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:39,130
-I need... I need water.
-Yes, water. Here.

287
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:47,010
That feels much better. I almost died.

288
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:52,810
-This is why we shouldn't live alone.
-Gosh, stop it.

289
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:00,340
(The phone is turned off.
Please leave a message)

290
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,620
(-after the tone.)
-Why won't she pick up her phone?

291
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:05,790
Did she go on a trip with a guy?

292
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,840
We have to be at a meeting
with the advertisers.

293
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,700
Okay. I'll tell Mr. Han about it.
You should go.

294
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,410
-All right. Bye.
-Bye.

295
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,700
Bye!

296
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:35,540
Gosh, I'm finally free.

297
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,220
What should I do?

298
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,500
Was that a raindrop?

299
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:49,130
No. No, please don't rain.

300
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,330
Hello.

301
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:26,530
Mr. Seo, I'm sorry, but the advertiser
only wants to see the models.

302
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,730
-I'm so sorry.
-What?

303
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:31,900
He wants to have a casual dinner
with the models before the shooting.

304
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:34,850
Well, we weren't told ahead
of this situation, so...

305
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:37,580
I understand. Let's do that.

306
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:39,380
You must be tired too. Go get some rest.

307
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:42,150
And get me the ramen from that place.

308
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,480
You don't have to worry
or take this the wrong way.

309
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:48,180
Okay, then. Call me if anything happens.

310
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:49,370
Please look after him.

311
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:52,670
Let's go.

312
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,600
-Good luck.
-Okay.

313
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,620
Hey.

314
00:22:04,850 --> 00:22:06,130
Come on in, Who-joon.

315
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:09,520
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you too.

316
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:12,820
I wanted to have a casual dinner
with the models,

317
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:14,970
-so please don't think too much of this.
-Sure.

318
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:18,360
This is... Right. Ms. Oh In-hyung.

319
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:20,390
She'll be your partner.

320
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:22,320
I heard you two are acquainted.

321
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,740
Yes, you're right.

322
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:29,100
-Long time no see.
-Yes, it has been a while.

323
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,560
-Take a seat.
-Okay.

324
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:36,580
One of our subsidiaries is
an entertainment agency,

325
00:22:36,970 --> 00:22:39,830
and I asked them to send
whoever they can as your partner...

326
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:44,410
I mean, I asked them to send a model,
and In-hyung came.

327
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,350
I heard you two are acquainted,

328
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:50,260
so I had a good feeling
about this advertisement.

329
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:03,730
Come out.

330
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,530
I said come out.

331
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:14,990
He's the second son of SP Group.

332
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:19,920
If it's all right with you,
may I go out for a second?

333
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:21,110
Sure.

334
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,580
-I'm sorry.
-Don't mind me.

335
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:29,950
Let's eat.

336
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:39,360
-Why are you here?
-What are you doing?

337
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:41,430
Didn't you see that I had an ad gig?

338
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,020
Anything but this!

339
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:45,830
How can you leave without telling me?

340
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,340
Did you do this because you knew
you'd be in it with him?

341
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:55,690
Hey, tell him that you're out.

342
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:59,520
No, go tell the advertiser
that you want another partner.

343
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,200
That way, everything will be over.
Let's get this over with.

344
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:03,480
Jae-joon!

345
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,300
If I asked him to switch her,
will that be the end of this?

346
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,330
How will that resolve anything?

347
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,130
Who-joon, stop that.

348
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:13,640
Stop minding us.

349
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:16,630
Just get back in there
and ask him to switch her out.

350
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:22,260
Who-joon, I really want this gig.

351
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:24,900
You don't mind having me
as a partner, do you?

352
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:27,940
I mind. I care about this.

353
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:33,130
I don't care

354
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,420
who plays my partner.

355
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:38,190
You better sort this out now.
Stop making a scene here.

356
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,520
Did you hear that?

357
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:47,300
He said he doesn't care
if you don't play his partner.

358
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,160
Do you want to destroy your pride
to do this job?

359
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,940
They wanted just anybody for this job.

360
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:58,120
When I offered to take it up,
I had already thrown out my pride!

361
00:24:58,210 --> 00:24:59,490
What about my pride?

362
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:07,320
Okay, Jae-joon.
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

363
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:10,880
But I want to start over
by using this ad as my chance.

364
00:25:10,970 --> 00:25:14,320
Who cares if Who-joon is the lead?
I'll get my break, then...

365
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,910
Are you sure you didn't volunteer
because it was him?

366
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:19,950
No? Fine.

367
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:23,200
I'm sure you thought this through.

368
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:24,660
You probably thought it'd be better

369
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:28,830
to do an ad gig with him
than someone who isn't as popular.

370
00:25:30,510 --> 00:25:32,660
But is that all?

371
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:38,250
See?

372
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:41,110
Your eyes say otherwise.

373
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:45,290
Your eyes won't lie for a minute
or even a second when you look at him.

374
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,450
That's why I'm saying no!

375
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:51,710
I said

376
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,990
that isn't the case.

377
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,820
Forget the American Village and whatnot.

378
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:14,070
Look at how pouring it is.

379
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:18,420
-I'll get it.
-Thanks.

380
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:25,810
Hey, you came back early.

381
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:29,110
Some advertisers
want to see the model alone.

382
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:30,870
I see. Really?

383
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,810
He wanted some ramen,
so I'm going to get some.

384
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,490
I wanted to get some for the crew too.

385
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:36,770
You'll have some, right?

386
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:40,640
Ramen on a rainy night sounds great.

387
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:42,750
-So you two are in, right?
-Yes.

388
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,530
Let's see. Then the production crew are...

389
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:49,530
You ran out of fingers.
Don't you think you need another hand?

390
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:54,940
I knew it.

391
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:57,190
In-hyung.

392
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:02,110
You can't fool me.

393
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:04,800
Who do you think knows best

394
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:08,800
about how you came to be with me
and why you're still here?

395
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:13,110
Me. It's me.

396
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,700
How can you be like this?

397
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,320
Have you ever thought about this
in my shoes?

398
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,530
I feel awful about myself too.

399
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,950
Whenever you get
jealous, annoyed, and angry,

400
00:27:29,610 --> 00:27:35,070
I tell myself that it's fine, that
it's the price I pay for living off you.

401
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,220
Do you know how dreadful that is?

402
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:39,420
That's why I'm telling you this now!

403
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:44,620
I don't care
even if you came to be out of need.

404
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:49,460
I don't care even if you're
still sticking around out of need.

405
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,950
So please!

406
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:55,090
Stay away from doing anything
that reminds me of him.

407
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,680
I also

408
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,600
want to win recognition.

409
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:09,170
You of all people
should've given me your trust.

410
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:25,980
Darn it.

411
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:08,870
(I'm glad I came today
to meet a chicken like you.)

412
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:10,940
Why won't anyone pick up their phone?
(I'm glad I came today
to meet a chicken like you.)

413
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:11,250
(I'm glad I came today
to meet a chicken like you.)

414
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,000
Mi-jung, why did you want me so badly?
(I'm glad I came today
to meet a chicken like you.)

415
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,580
Mi-jung, why did you want me so badly?

416
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:15,300
So I came.

417
00:29:15,650 --> 00:29:17,890
Geun-young can't be reached.

418
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:20,840
You're acquainted with that reporter
who writes for Who-joon.

419
00:29:20,930 --> 00:29:24,760
Call that guy and find out
what's going on.

420
00:29:25,110 --> 00:29:27,130
She's in Japan on a shooting.

421
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,040
-Really?
-Yes.

422
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,510
Then why won't she pick up her phone?

423
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,680
It's her first time in Japan.
What if she gets lost?

424
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:39,100
Hey, she's not a kid.

425
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,580
Don't be worried about her,
and get me a glass of cold beer.

426
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:48,610
You must love fried chicken, Shin-hyuk.

427
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:51,820
All of Mi-jung's men are
crazy about fried chicken.

428
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,020
"Men"?

429
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:57,980
Well, it was great
back when she worked at a yukhoe place.

430
00:29:58,110 --> 00:29:58,290
Right, and the pork belly place.

431
00:29:58,290 --> 00:29:59,690
(I'm glad I came today
to meet a chicken like you.)
Right, and the pork belly place.

432
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:00,620
(I'm glad I came today
to meet a chicken like you.)

433
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:01,720
And the raw fish place.
(I'm glad I came today
to meet a chicken like you.)

434
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:02,550
(I'm glad I came today
to meet a chicken like you.)

435
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:06,340
You must like all kinds of food.
I heard you have lots of women too.

436
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:09,990
Gosh, you'd make my girlfriends sad
if you put it like that.

437
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,860
I'm, you know, a guy with lots of love.

438
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:18,480
You have that much love,
yet you visit me here very often.

439
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:19,850
I'm grateful to death.

440
00:30:19,930 --> 00:30:21,610
You don't have to die.

441
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,030
That hurts.

442
00:30:29,390 --> 00:30:31,860
Doesn't it smell great?
This is a really great place.

443
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:34,850
Everything seems the same.
You'll be surprised once you try it.

444
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:40,750
Here you are.

445
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:42,510
-Thank you.
-Sure.

446
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:46,770
I've only seen this in Japanese dramas.

447
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,320
Actually, it's my first time in Japan.

448
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,340
You thought he'd make fun of you.

449
00:30:54,430 --> 00:30:56,450
Yes, you know what he's like, right?

450
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:59,620
I thought he might take me as a joke
if I said it's my first time.

451
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:01,340
Well, he already does.

452
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:05,160
I think he does that
because he's comfortable around you.

453
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,980
No way. Around me?

454
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,710
I'm sure you were angry with him today,

455
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,390
I haven't seen him
pull a prank like that for ages.

456
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:16,780
There's a need for someone
to mess with him from time to time.

457
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:19,460
I see. Right.

458
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,620
I'm glad you're here for him.

459
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:27,030
Now that you put it like that,
I feel like I'm pretty useful.

460
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:30,110
Do you know
what people used to call me at work?

461
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,390
Just Geun-young.

462
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:34,200
They always said,
"Just make Geun-young do it."

463
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,930
There's something different about you.

464
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,620
You have such a gentle way of talking.

465
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:45,030
Anyway, you seem to adore Who-joon a lot.

466
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:48,500
Back when I was the youngest manager,

467
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:51,500
I took the highway back to Seoul
from Busan.

468
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:54,490
But the car suddenly stopped midway.

469
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:57,300
I called the insurance company,
and that's when I realized

470
00:31:57,390 --> 00:31:59,330
we were completely out of gas.

471
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,180
I was a total idiot. That's what.

472
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:04,210
-So what happened?
-We didn't make it to his next schedule,

473
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:07,340
Then the CEO lashed me out
with all kinds of vulgar words.

474
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:09,490
I figured I'm done working with him.

475
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,960
Right. But how are you still here?

476
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:15,700
On my way out,
I saw Joon there waiting for me.

477
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:19,300
I apologize to him,
then he said, "Why are you sorry?"

478
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:22,030
"That can happen when we get busy,
and you're just a rookie."

479
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,720
"Why is he making
such a big deal out of this?"

480
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:27,440
Really? Who-joon said that?

481
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:29,200
Yes, the same Who-joon.

482
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:33,030
He said he could catch a break
thanks to my mistake.

483
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:36,020
He said he was very happy
on his way back in the towing truck,

484
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:38,000
then thanked me instead.

485
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:41,880
And he asked me to stay with him
and be his manager to the end.

486
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:49,350
I'm having a hard time believing you.

487
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:53,050
You can't make up
heartwarming stories about your singer.

488
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:56,390
He's a good kid.

489
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,740
He debuted while he was still young,
so the first thing he learned was

490
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:02,200
how the world was cold
and he always had to weigh stuff.

491
00:33:02,290 --> 00:33:05,500
He never got a chance
to be his gentle self.

492
00:33:05,990 --> 00:33:08,010
But he's a kind-hearted kid.

493
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:10,300
I know that.

494
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:13,910
Just...

495
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,900
Just stay here.

496
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,890
I'm doing this so you feel hot.

497
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:27,500
You're late. Start running.

498
00:33:32,910 --> 00:33:35,420
You should eat before it turns cold.
Isn't it good?

499
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:36,870
I just shared all kinds of stuff.

500
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:58,570
Hey!

501
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,510
(She's...)

502
00:34:18,889 --> 00:34:21,230
(I think she's the same woman
from that time.)

503
00:34:21,449 --> 00:34:22,900
You broke his heart!

504
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:26,150
(What are they talking about?)

505
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,949
(She was crying back then,)

506
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:48,900
(and she's crying again today.)

507
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:02,720
You're back.

508
00:35:04,390 --> 00:35:06,060
I'll go give these out.

509
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:08,520
That smells great.

510
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:22,210
You should've told me.
Why did you do that with people around?

511
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:32,240
-Who is it?
-I'm here with the ramen.

512
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,390
Mr. Seo, you don't look so well.

513
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:41,920
I gave these out
to everyone who wanted ramen.

514
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:44,470
-And these were left.
-Yes, thank you.

515
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,990
Is Geun-young getting some rest?

516
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,630
She must've been tired.
I think she's asleep.

517
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,390
-Goodnight.
-Yes, goodbye.

518
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,580
-Bye.
-Thank you.

519
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:03,880
It's probably cold and soggy,

520
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:05,720
but if you want some, eat it.

521
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,820
Get some rest.

522
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,980
I have to let you go,

523
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:40,000
but I can't do that yet.

524
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:42,510
And I...

525
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,500
And I still...

526
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:53,510
(Your message has been sent.
Thank you for using our service.)

527
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:59,010
need you.

528
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:22,460
(And I...)

529
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,550
(And I still...)

530
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,630
(Your mailbox is full.)

531
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,680
(Father)

532
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:02,230
Yes, Mr. Chairman.

533
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:05,360
Yes.

534
00:38:06,370 --> 00:38:07,470
I'm sorry.

535
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:10,590
I will

536
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,540
figure everything out.

537
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,420
Let me go!

538
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:31,980
Hey!

539
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:34,660
Are you an idiot?

540
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:37,170
I told you not to see her.
Why did you bring her here?

541
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,530
Stop that, Ji-hyang.

542
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:40,950
Don't call me by my name.

543
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,840
How long will you do this?

544
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:45,090
How long will you lurk around him?

545
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:47,420
It's a misunderstanding. Stop that.

546
00:38:47,510 --> 00:38:49,220
I asked him to come out.

547
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:51,910
-If he didn't, I was going to visit him...
-If you left him

548
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,110
for a jerk like that, then it's over.

549
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:57,500
He only had you in his heart,
but you broke his heart!

550
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:00,970
The least you can do is let it mend.
Why do you keep coming back to break it?

551
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,250
That's enough, Ji-hyang.

552
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:06,820
In-hyung, if you really care about him,
please just leave.

553
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:12,280
Yes, you're right, Ji-hyang.

554
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:15,100
I didn't think this through.

555
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,340
I'm sorry.

556
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:26,230
Don't go after her.

557
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:18,540
Good morning. You got up early.

558
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:19,730
-Hey.
-Morning.

559
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:23,820
Hotel breakfast is
the best part of traveling abroad.

560
00:40:24,350 --> 00:40:26,150
-Eat up, everyone.
-Okay.

561
00:40:26,770 --> 00:40:28,490
Who-joon, you don't look so well.

562
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:30,420
Did you catch a cold?

563
00:40:31,390 --> 00:40:32,890
Goodness.

564
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,390
And Geun-young,
you don't look well either.

565
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:37,290
You didn't get enough sleep.

566
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:40,150
Goodness, you're all in bad condition.

567
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:43,310
What's going on?

568
00:40:43,750 --> 00:40:46,220
-Hey, let's go get some food.
-I just did.

569
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:48,150
-Eat some more.
-More?

570
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:50,350
Why?

571
00:40:54,970 --> 00:40:56,650
Did you eat that ramen last night?

572
00:40:58,580 --> 00:40:59,990
No, I didn't.

573
00:41:00,080 --> 00:41:02,810
You should've had it since this is
your first time in Japan. Why not?

574
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:06,900
It was all soggy.

575
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:10,680
Did the noodles get soggy
in the heavy rain?

576
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:12,880
Or was it people who got soggy?

577
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,590
Eat up.

578
00:41:21,370 --> 00:41:24,540
I'm sorry, but you can eat that.
Sorry for the trouble.

579
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:26,170
I'll go upstairs and get some rest.

580
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:27,710
Don't mind me and eat up.

581
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:35,010
What's wrong? Was he mean again?

582
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:37,920
-He's always the same.
-He probably feels embarrassed.

583
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,290
Anyway, who's that woman...

584
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:44,610
Who's who?

585
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:51,120
Don't be surprised. I won't be curious.

586
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,300
Goodness.

587
00:41:52,610 --> 00:41:55,430
Mr. Seo, will you go with him
to shoot that advertisement?

588
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,620
Yes, of course.

589
00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:23,190
Aren't you going to go?

590
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,640
-Director.
-Hey, you're here.

591
00:43:37,730 --> 00:43:38,830
Yes.

592
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,910
-What do you think?
-Everything is going well thanks to you.

593
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:43,310
You're an expert, after all.

594
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:45,560
-One second.
-Okay.

595
00:43:45,650 --> 00:43:47,580
-Where's the partner?
-Not yet.

596
00:43:47,670 --> 00:43:48,990
Isn't she a rookie? Call her.

597
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:50,570
This is funny.

598
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:53,390
What kind of a rookie dares
to make the top star wait?

599
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:54,710
She's here!

600
00:43:58,140 --> 00:43:59,510
I'm sorry.

601
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:02,810
-I'm sorry.
(-It's her.)

602
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:05,840
I'm sorry.

603
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:09,630
I'm sorry.

604
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:12,570
All right.
Let's get ready and keep it moving.

605
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,870
It's all right. You can relax.

606
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:19,260
Thank you.

607
00:44:26,610 --> 00:44:28,370
(Who-joon's partner is)

608
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:31,450
(that woman?)

609
00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:35,320
Hello.

610
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,090
Hello.

611
00:44:38,270 --> 00:44:40,380
-I'm the CEO of her agency.
-Hello.

612
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:41,880
-I see.
-Why is Jae-joon here?

613
00:44:41,970 --> 00:44:43,420
-Hello.
-Please take good care of her.

614
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:45,220
We'll do our best.

615
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:49,140
-Isn't that Oh In-hyung and JJ?
-Then let's start from here.

616
00:44:49,450 --> 00:44:50,900
-Please take a seat.
-I see.

617
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:54,110
-What an odd group.
-Why?

618
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:57,010
They used to be in the same agency.

619
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:58,290
I see.

620
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:01,150
My gosh, you really don't have
good information.

621
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:02,600
Fine.

622
00:45:03,310 --> 00:45:05,640
I need to go check that out.

623
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:09,550
Here's the script.
So you're going to walk along the beach.

624
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:12,150
-That thing?
-Yes.

625
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:17,300
-Geun-young.
-Hello.

626
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:19,280
What brings you here?

627
00:45:19,370 --> 00:45:22,670
His partner is in my agency.

628
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:27,640
I see. Is she the one
I met at the TV station?

629
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:29,660
Yes, the one you wouldn't recognize.

630
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:32,040
-You haven't seen her, right?
-No.

631
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:33,490
Where could I have seen her?

632
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,700
It's really windy.

633
00:45:37,270 --> 00:45:40,130
(Special Cafe Latte Storyboard)

634
00:46:03,190 --> 00:46:04,380
They look great.

635
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:10,580
Of course, it'd be great.

636
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:12,430
What a sight.

637
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:15,460
It must be tough to face each other.

638
00:46:16,830 --> 00:46:18,280
-Sorry?
-What?

639
00:46:19,730 --> 00:46:21,620
The sun is really bright,

640
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:23,520
so wouldn't it be tough
to face each other?

641
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:24,880
I guess so.

642
00:46:35,350 --> 00:46:36,850
What would that feel like?

643
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:40,410
Like you're head over heels.

644
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:41,600
Sorry?

645
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:48,070
No, I mean that the sand is so soft
that their heels are probably stuck.

646
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:49,520
-I see.
-Yes.

647
00:46:55,150 --> 00:46:56,250
Do you like her?

648
00:46:57,620 --> 00:46:58,720
I mean, the sea.

649
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:03,780
Not really. It's way too windy.

650
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:06,150
A windy beach can get annoying.

651
00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:13,020
Even if it looks beautiful?

652
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:17,500
There are beautiful landscapes
that can be an eyesore to you.

653
00:47:22,780 --> 00:47:24,370
It's a bit sad, though.

654
00:47:45,970 --> 00:47:47,070
It's getting hot.

655
00:47:48,210 --> 00:47:50,550
-And a bit icky.
-Tell me about it.

656
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:54,110
Is it because it rained yesterday?
What's with this weather?

657
00:47:55,470 --> 00:47:57,450
I'm sure there's a reason.

658
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:01,060
-I'm sure there is something.
-There is something.

659
00:48:02,430 --> 00:48:04,540
What did you just say?

660
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:06,340
Me?

661
00:48:07,090 --> 00:48:08,190
I didn't say anything.

662
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:10,650
I must be hearing things.

663
00:48:13,290 --> 00:48:15,230
I think the shooting is almost over.

664
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:18,490
Geun-young, I'll see you later.

665
00:48:18,570 --> 00:48:19,670
Okay.

666
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:30,190
What's going on
between Jae-joon and that woman?

667
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:31,950
Geun-young!

668
00:48:34,190 --> 00:48:37,320
Let's get ready to shoot our show.

669
00:48:37,410 --> 00:48:40,270
-Right, okay. Finally.
-Yes.

670
00:48:54,570 --> 00:48:57,560
(I need to start
by solving this guy's mystery.)

671
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:01,470
Let's get started, Geun-young.

672
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:04,290
(So what exactly happened
between him and her?)

673
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:05,560
Like this.

674
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,410
You haven't done this a lot, right?

675
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:20,130
Is this how you'll be?

676
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:21,320
All right, now.

677
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:24,660
Goodness.

678
00:49:44,550 --> 00:49:45,650
(What is this?)

679
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:50,660
(My heart must have gone crazy.)

680
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:59,460
Goodness.

681
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:04,000
What are you doing?
I told you not to satisfy your needs here.

682
00:50:09,190 --> 00:50:11,960
Okay, now. Let's do this again.

683
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,360
My goodness.

684
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:20,100
-Oh no.
-Wait, don't rush out.

685
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:21,860
Gosh. Oh no.

686
00:50:21,950 --> 00:50:24,100
Keep shooting. Keep rolling.

687
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:25,640
Geun-young, no!

688
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:27,400
Geun-young!

689
00:50:28,330 --> 00:50:30,310
That's it. Who-joon, carry her out.

690
00:50:30,970 --> 00:50:33,340
This is why I said
we shouldn't go in the water!

691
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:34,620
Are you okay, Geun-young?

692
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,480
I told you not to do this!

693
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:40,600
-Geun-young!
-No, I'm fine.

694
00:50:40,690 --> 00:50:42,890
Be quiet. Geun-young, are you okay?

695
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:45,440
-Get her out.
-Are you okay?

696
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:47,200
Geun-young. Geun-young!

697
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:50,590
-Geun-young! Keep your eyes closed.
-I'm fine.

698
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:52,350
Geun-young!

699
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:53,540
What am I going to do?

700
00:50:55,210 --> 00:50:56,310
Wake up.

701
00:50:57,370 --> 00:51:01,190
Geun-young. I'm so relieved.
I was really shocked.

702
00:51:02,290 --> 00:51:03,390
I'm so relieved.

703
00:51:12,020 --> 00:51:15,490
Shouldn't I be awarded
as a brave citizen or whatever?

704
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,500
Do you want this towel?

705
00:51:19,590 --> 00:51:21,080
I'm fine.

706
00:51:21,170 --> 00:51:22,580
I need to talk to Mr. Han.

707
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,390
You need to stay focused.

708
00:51:28,470 --> 00:51:30,500
Your mind was somewhere else
as soon as we began.

709
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:33,670
-Why did you fall in there?
-It's not like I wanted to.

710
00:51:33,750 --> 00:51:35,600
You pushed me really hard.

711
00:51:40,930 --> 00:51:44,310
You better stay focused on me from now on.

712
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,670
You're the one who overreacted.

713
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:55,670
Goodness. That two-faced jerk.

714
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:23,430
(Who-joon)

715
00:52:23,430 --> 00:52:25,320
I thought he was gay.
(Who-joon)

716
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:26,070
(Who-joon)

717
00:52:28,090 --> 00:52:28,580
But he's not.

718
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:29,850
(Who-joon, gay)
But he's not.

719
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:32,100
Then is that woman...

720
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:33,680
(That woman)
Then is that woman...

721
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:35,970
(Who-joon, gay, that woman)

722
00:52:36,230 --> 00:52:37,330
The tteokbokki?

723
00:52:37,950 --> 00:52:39,140
Like this?

724
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:42,480
Then where does JJ stand?

725
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:44,990
(JJ)

726
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:55,940
It's not like I'm a detective.

727
00:52:58,280 --> 00:52:59,380
Whatever.

728
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:25,640
Goodness.
You look like you slept very well.

729
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,140
Did you catch a cold?

730
00:53:32,330 --> 00:53:33,700
You can worry about others?

731
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:35,320
Did you?

732
00:53:40,910 --> 00:53:43,110
I feel fine after getting some sleep.

733
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:46,370
Just don't let me catch it.

734
00:53:48,830 --> 00:53:50,370
What did I expect?

735
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:55,520
Geun-young, there's no shooting today.
Do you want to come to town with us?

736
00:53:55,610 --> 00:53:57,190
Where is everyone?

737
00:53:57,540 --> 00:53:59,300
Ms. No was gone
by the time I woke up late.

738
00:53:59,390 --> 00:54:01,420
They both went out to shop.

739
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:03,620
Are they here to work or travel?

740
00:54:03,700 --> 00:54:07,140
Today is the premiere,
so they wanted to watch it together.

741
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:09,120
You can come out with us.

742
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:12,240
She doesn't want to come. Let her stay.

743
00:54:12,330 --> 00:54:13,690
Why are you pestering her?

744
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:23,810
He must be feeling better.
He's grumbling again.

745
00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:26,320
Come with us. It's our last day.

746
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:28,300
Okay, Mr. Seo.

747
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:43,960
I left my wallet in the car.

748
00:54:44,050 --> 00:54:47,220
You two can head over to the udon place.
I'll make a quick trip.

749
00:54:48,850 --> 00:54:51,840
Goodness, he can be very sloppy.

750
00:54:52,810 --> 00:54:55,270
I guess you don't realize who causes that.

751
00:54:55,620 --> 00:54:58,350
-What did you say?
-Let's browse as we wait.

752
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:00,770
My gosh.

753
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:03,850
This is cute.

754
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:14,630
These come in all kinds of colors.
I guess it's a local character in Okinawa.

755
00:55:14,980 --> 00:55:17,010
I'll get one and hand it out.

756
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:19,340
We don't have this in Korea, right?

757
00:55:21,270 --> 00:55:23,740
What? Where did he go?

758
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:29,810
I can't believe this guy.
He should've said he's leaving.

759
00:55:48,250 --> 00:55:49,610
-Hey.
-Yes?

760
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,380
May I help you?

761
00:55:52,470 --> 00:55:54,670
-I'm sorry.
-Oh, all right.

762
00:56:01,710 --> 00:56:02,810
Oh no.

763
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:20,190
Why didn't you go? Where's Geun-young?

764
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:22,870
-She was just here.
-What? You were here with her.

765
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,460
I left for a second...

766
00:56:25,030 --> 00:56:27,100
Where did she go?

767
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:28,990
She's such a troublemaker.

768
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:31,010
She said it's her first time coming here.

769
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:33,560
Her phone doesn't work right now.

770
00:56:34,970 --> 00:56:36,340
Man.

771
00:56:55,780 --> 00:56:56,880
Darn it.

772
00:57:09,030 --> 00:57:10,260
Where is she?

773
00:57:32,390 --> 00:57:33,490
This is driving me insane.

774
00:58:19,250 --> 00:58:20,480
It's okay.

775
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:23,210
I just have to get back to the hotel.

776
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,100
Okay.

777
00:58:26,110 --> 00:58:28,140
But what is the hotel called?

778
00:59:17,590 --> 00:59:20,320
I want to go home.

779
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:24,190
Why did I tag along anyway?
Look at this mess.

780
00:59:26,610 --> 00:59:28,590
Mom...

781
00:59:35,550 --> 00:59:36,650
Found you.

782
00:59:40,870 --> 00:59:42,500
I told you to stay focused on me.

783
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:17,910
(You're embracing your anti-fan.)
