I mean, why won't anyone contact me?

11
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:10,570
The two-faced Who-joon. It's a huge scoop.

12
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:12,860
Hey, move. Out of my way.

00:01:31,289 --> 00:01:33,450
Is that your way of making an apology?

16
00:01:33,539 --> 00:01:36,090
Go apologize to your mother
if you want to apologize.

17
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:38,250
And go back to your studio apartment.

18
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,240
Shin-hyuk is moving in.

19
00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:44,930
Are you two getting married?

20
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:47,270
Couples don't live together
just to get married.

21
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,670
What are you saying, girl?

22
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:50,920
You aren't a grownup
just because you're of age.

23
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,380
-If you're going to live with him--
-Cut it out.

24
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:54,960
I'll manage my own life,

25
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:57,560
so you can go figure out your life.

26
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,890
Stay home safely.

27
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:01,650
Bye.

28
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,910
Make sure you keep my house safe, okay?

29
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,070
Keep what safe?
There's nothing to take anyway.

30
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,010
Hello?

31
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,190
You're a reporter?

32
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:32,450
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

33
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:36,810
He told me
to only go to places as I'm told,

34
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,620
and this is the place?

35
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,860
I feel like I'm a flower he sends
to new businesses.

36
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:47,540
I'm always here taking pictures
whenever a new place opens.

37
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:50,579
Why won't he just make flyers
with my picture and give those out?

38
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:56,740
-Smile.
-How will I do that while chewing...

39
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,290
Hello.

40
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:04,570
You must be very busy, but it's an honor
to have you here at our grand opening.

41
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,580
Sure.

42
00:03:05,670 --> 00:03:07,120
May I take a photo with you?

43
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:08,490
-What?
-Sure.

44
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,960
Thank you.
And please leave us an autograph too.

45
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:29,170
(It wasn't delicious.)

46
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:38,579
(That's a phrase
which doesn't fit this place.)

47
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:43,510
You're as witty as your popularity.

48
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:46,370
I'll have our special house blend coffee

49
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:50,640
all ready for you to take
before you leave.

50
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:51,870
Okay.

51
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,720
No.

52
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:59,170
I can't just take something for free.

53
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,560
What?

54
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:04,010
-Thank you very much.
-Sure.

55
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,380
Credit card, please.

56
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:11,320
What are you doing?

57
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,490
So 50 coffee and 50 lunch boxes.

58
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:16,380
Yes, that'll be 750,000 won.

59
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:18,269
-One-time payment.
-Okay.

60
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,810
That's the corporate card,
so we can write it off as an expense.

61
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:27,110
Here's your card.

62
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,430
-Thank you.
-Sure.

63
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,730
I saw that girl yesterday.
You know, Florence or something.

64
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,110
Florence?
There was a group called Florence?

65
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,280
There's this girl group
that disbanded without getting a break.

66
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:41,060
There was this member
who was the prettiest, and her name was...

67
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,130
It was In-hyung or something.

68
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:47,220
I never saw her after they disbanded,
and I think she found a new sugar daddy

69
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:49,470
-to live her life in luxury.
-My goodness.

70
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:51,450
I saw her shopping at a department store.

71
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:54,310
That's what always happens
to female celebrities who never make it.

72
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:57,470
Tell me about it.
She's nothing but a gold digger, right?

73
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,140
-Darn it, come on!
-Oh no.

74
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,850
I'm sorry. It's my mistake.

75
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,270
Let me pay to have your clothes cleaned.

76
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:10,100
You don't have to pay for it.

77
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,870
You can just buy me coffee later.

78
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,290
Are you a gold digger?

79
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:19,610
What?

80
00:05:21,410 --> 00:05:23,260
I'm sorry. It's my misunderstanding.

81
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:28,450
This is why we say it's wrong
to slander someone with a misconception.

82
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,640
What did you say?

83
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,790
That's really horrible, you know.

84
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:34,650
Thanks for the lesson.

85
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:36,190
Joon, let's go.

86
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,230
I can't believe this.

87
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,780
We'll reimburse you for the damage.

88
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:43,060
Please give me a call.

89
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:48,030
Excuse me, are you Reporter Choi Hee-gun?

90
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,880
-Are you Ms. Lee Geun-young?
-Yes.

91
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:53,000
Hello, I'm Choi Hee-gun of "Attention."

92
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,670
I don't have my card.

93
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,650
("Attention," Choi Hee-gun)

94
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:57,930
(Voice recording)

95
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:59,420
Since we were in the same industry,
(Voice recording)

96
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,040
Since we were in the same industry,

97
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:02,720
let's cut to the chase
and get right to the question.

98
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,620
Why did you throw your shoe?

99
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:09,410
Is it because of Who-joon's true nature
you spoke of in the email?

100
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,740
Yes, that's exactly it.

101
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,870
If you tell me the reason why
he threw the shoe at you,

102
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,020
I could probably find out
what his true nature is.

103
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,650
Tell me that reason first.

104
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:26,840
The awful fate began
at the grand opening of JJ's club.

105
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:27,890
Over here!

106
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:31,060
(We heard Who-joon will be there,
so we went out to cover the story.)

107
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:33,130
-Who-joon!
-Look over here!

108
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:37,480
Then I saw him with some woman
at the end of the hallway.

109
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,820
Isn't this huge? Don't you think so?

110
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,360
Could you walk away from that?

111
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,810
No, I guess you're right.

112
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,740
(I got curious,
so I kept my eyes on them.)

113
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,860
(-Then he spotted me as he walked out.)
-Excuse me.

114
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,720
(He suddenly threw my camera and...)

115
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,140
Didn't you explain what happened?

116
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,030
I tried to explain.

117
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:57,810
But I can't really contain my alcohol,

118
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,770
so I threw up a little, not too much.

119
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:06,570
Then he became totally furious,
got angry at me, and treated me...

120
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,420
Because of trashy journos like you.

121
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,220
like a trashy journo.

122
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:11,490
What's more important is

123
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:14,490
that he got me fired over this.

124
00:07:14,570 --> 00:07:15,670
What?

125
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:19,240
This is his true nature,
completely different from his reputation.

126
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:23,240
I thought I should expose
this truth to the entire world.

127
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:27,290
So what do you expect to get from this?

128
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,520
Reinstatement, of course.

129
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:30,370
No matter what his true nature is,

130
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:33,850
I don't think that's enough reason
to have you reinstated.

131
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:37,320
-What?
-Think about it.

132
00:07:37,409 --> 00:07:39,920
If they would take you back after this,

133
00:07:40,010 --> 00:07:43,830
they wouldn't have fired you right away
when Who-joon asked them to let you go.

134
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,170
Have you gone insane?

135
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:52,110
I told you to go there and have a meal,
not clean out their entire stock.

136
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:54,310
On top of that,
you made a scene with a customer?

137
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,640
She was badmouthing entertainers,
so I just told her off.

138
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:59,630
If it wasn't about you,
you should've just let it go.

139
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,870
Who do you think you are to tell her off?

140
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,510
I have to help out the people
in my industry.

141
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:08,960
Why do I bother making you seem mysterious
if you're going to go out and do this?

142
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:11,860
And why were you at the club?

143
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,840
Was it also to help out your colleague?

144
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:15,510
I had no other choice.

145
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,550
You recently seem to have
not many choices these days.

146
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,720
That's how you'll end up
becoming a has-been without a choice.

147
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:23,740
Don't you think you're already a has-been?

148
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,140
If I become old, just leave me.
What's the problem?

149
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:30,120
How dare you look at me like that?

150
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,770
Did you get your big break alone?

151
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:37,820
I'm the one who patched things up
whenever you got in trouble.

152
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:45,260
Is that why you abandoned JJ and In-hyung?

153
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,680
To make me into this jerk
to do whatever you want with me?

154
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:56,170
If you're still gripped by that time
and giving me a tough time,

155
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,930
you need to get real.

156
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,880
You wouldn't be who you are now
without that incident.

157
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,240
You know that very well.

158
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,800
I wouldn't have become
this jerk that I am,

159
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:09,020
if you didn't abandon them so easily.

160
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,730
Hey, let's go. Let's go.

161
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,530
Where are you going? Hey!

162
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:44,660
That'll be 3,000 won.

163

("Attention": "Who-joon's Two Sides?
Could Her Story Be the Truth?")

164

(Lee claims Who-joon got her fired
from a magazine publisher.)

from a magazine publisher.)

166
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:53,060
(Does Who-joon really have
that much power?)

167
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,520
(I wanted to ask her this
as she let out her anger.)

168
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:58,960
(Is her side of the story
the truth and the whole story?)

169
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,940
When did I let my anger out?

170
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:03,620
People can get a little emotional
when they talk.

171
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:04,810
I can't believe this guy.

172
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,780
-Hey.
(-The real-time comments are awful.)

173
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,410
Comments?

174
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,650
What are people saying? Read me a few.

175

("Stop making up stuff.
Go write your resume instead.")

176

("I guess anti-fans evolve.
This layoff claim is new.")

177

("She's obviously a gold digger.
All famous people suffer from them.")

178
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:24,430
("Some are trying to find out who she is.
She'll be dismissed by the world.")

(Geun-young, are you okay?)

180
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:30,680
Mi-jung, I'm done being patient.

181
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:32,620
(Geun-young. Hey, Geun-young!)

182
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,650
Okay.

183
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,100
That's it.

184
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,620
All right.

185
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:57,210
Why did you suddenly want IV therapy?

186
00:10:58,710 --> 00:11:00,550
I've been tired for a few days.

187
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:03,060
I'd lose my face
if I faint during a meeting.

188
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:05,570
It's because your meeting is
at that magazine publisher.

189
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:08,960
No. What magazine publisher, anyway?

190
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,480
Don't mind her. She won't be there anyway.

191
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:15,340
I'm not sure if this was
your power or Mr. Bae's power,

192
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,230
but she was taken care of.

193
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:21,060
Taken care of? Was she fired?

194
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:24,310
Goodness.
I thought that's what you wanted.

195
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,920
You're all done.

196
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:29,680
Let me get the nurse.

197
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:36,020
They didn't have to fire her.

200
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:08,750
-Hey, Hee-gun. Long time no see.
(-Hey, it's me.)

201
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,870
Did you read my article?

202
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:12,850
Yes, I did.

203
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:15,620
You should watch out for her, though.

204
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,950
It looks like
she's left with nothing but malice.

205
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:22,830
(I sent Ji-hyang the email
she sent to reporters, so check that too.)

206
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,020
All right.

207
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:26,750
I know you're always looking out for me.
Thanks, Hee-gun.

208
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:29,740
Was that Mr. Choi?

209
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:33,310
I was going to give it to you later.

210
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:34,710
Take a look.

211
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,120
Yes, Mr. Bae.

212
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,320
We're on the move.

213
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,230
What?

214
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,460
Okay.

215
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:52,310
Joon, reporters are in an uproar
because of that woman.

216
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,510
He scheduled an interview.

217
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:58,870

(Don't use your popularity
to ruin someone's life!)

230
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,940
Come out and immediately apologize!

231
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:24,530
Hey, lady. Why are you making up stuff?

232
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:25,900
"Lady"?

233
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:30,650
Kid, how dare you
speak with no respect to an adult?

234
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,670
You need to stay out of this.

235
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,970
No, you stay out.
Why are you making a scene here?

236
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,350
-She's right.
-Get lost.

237
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,420
Making a scene? You're making a scene now.

238

I'm only speaking up for myself
as a member of this free country.

239
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:47,900
Then go to the National Assembly.
Why are you picking a fight here?

240
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:50,190
-Yes, tell her.
-Why is she doing this here?

241
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:55,510
Girls, do you think he'll care
that you're here doing this for him?

242
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:55,730
If any of you had a job,
he's a man who's capable of firing you.

243
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:57,140
(Who-joon, you can lean on us.
Who-joon, don't go anywhere.)
If any of you had a job,
he's a man who's capable of firing you.

244
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,850
If any of you had a job,
he's a man who's capable of firing you.

245

that you're still in school.

Don't stand around here for him.

Go home and cheer for your parents
when they come home.

248

I don't have any parents.

249
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:10,070
What?

250
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:13,330

but ATMs who buy his albums.

-What's she saying?
-What the heck is she saying?

256
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:25,690
You're right.
But we're ATMs with feelings.

257
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,150
I didn't argue about that.

258
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:28,290
Girls, step on her.

259
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:30,270

It's Who-joon!

262
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,760
My gosh!

263
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:21,790
Are you all right?

264
00:16:24,170 --> 00:16:27,640
Everyone, you'll make me really sad
if you do something like this.

265

(We'll always walk with you.)

266

-We're sorry.

-I'm sorry.
-We're sorry.

268
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:34,680
There are people who like me
just as you do,

269
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:39,080
but on the other side,
I'm sure many people also hate me.

270
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:41,590
-No way.
-No one hates you.

271
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,260
I believe she is

272
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,060
also a fan of mine
in an unconventional way.

273

because of this misunderstanding,
(We'll always walk with you.)

This lady hates me
because of this misunderstanding,

embrace her first.

280
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,760
I'll keep doing my best
so that she'll one day become my fan.

Give me your support, everyone.

-Of course!

283
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:20,880
-Let's go.
-This way, please.

284
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:22,069
-Where to?
-Let's go.

285
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:29,070
Where are we going right now?

286
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,020
Why don't we leave for now?

May I have a moment with her?

290
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:02,950
Sure. Let me close the door.

291
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:15,090
-Happy now?
-Well, yes.

292
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:18,210
Thank you for your apology.

293

-I thought you only wanted an apology.

Once you get one thing,
you're asking for another.

295

You just said
something about embracing this.

296

Don't you think you were fired
because of your incompetence?

297
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:34,320
Do you think reporters who begin to write
before knowing the truth

298
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:35,330
is a real reporter?

Hey.

And you don't even know what I'm like.
Why do you keep jumping to conclusions?

302
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:46,770
Really? Is that why

303
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:50,470
you jumped to a conclusion

00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:41,730
Are you all right?

313
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:44,720
You're stung by those bees.

314
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:49,120
I'll bring some water.
Let's talk again after you drink that.

315
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:57,610
Yes, hello?

316

(This is the General Affairs

(You said you'll come by last time.)

318
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:04,030
(So are you coming over
to settle your severance pay or not?)

319
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,100
Yes, right. I'll be there.

320
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:08,700
I will. Of course, I'll come.

321
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:11,600
All right. I'll be there.

322
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:14,590
I'm taking that money. I'll be there.

323
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:16,220
Okay.

324
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:22,340
Hey! Everyone knows what you look like!

327
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,700
(I guess she always fights.)

328
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,330

329

("Who-joon:
An Anti-fan Is an Unconventional Fan,")

-What is?

Isn't this Geun-young?

-Look, this is huge.
-What is?

334
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:46,320
Isn't this Geun-young?

335
00:20:46,930 --> 00:20:50,140
No way. I can't believe
she's the angry heel.

336
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:53,970
I'll edit the interview
in the direction you wanted.

337
00:20:54,410 --> 00:20:56,220
-Yes, thank you.
-Sure.

338
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:03,120
Do you remember the woman
who threw her shoe at Who-joon?

339
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:07,440
She used to work here when that happened.

340
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,310
Those reporters have been here
since the morning

341
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,600
to get an interview
from one of her ex-colleagues.

342
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:15,580
I see. Goodness.

343
00:21:16,410 --> 00:21:17,510
What a shame.

344
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,720
Reporters are everywhere looking for you.

345
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:36,210
Hey, you're...

346
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:38,190
Ms. Lee Geun-young, right?

347
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,390
Who-joon recently put you in a tough spot.

348
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,580
How did you recognize me?

349
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:44,880
Right, I actually saw that
in front of my club.

350
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:47,340
And I have the shoe you lost.

351
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:51,480
Really? Thank you.

352
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:56,360
You know, we say people change
once they become a huge star.

353
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:58,960
They can't be trusted, can they?

354
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:01,860
Did he look down on you
after he got his big break?

355
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:04,370
He did, right? I knew he would.

356
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:07,010
I mean, his attitude completely changed
when he was alone with me

357
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,900
after he went away from his fans.

358
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:13,480
I mean, seriously.
What did he say? Embracing his anti-fan?

359
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:16,650
I knew he had a scheme.

360
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:25,180
So are you going to be patient about this?

361
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:27,560
I don't want to,

362
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,890
but there's not much I can do.

363
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:33,940
Why not?
I'm sure some are supportive of you.

364
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,180
Right?

365
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:37,630
Of course.

366
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,660
I'm here too.

367
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:40,850
I see.

368
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,940
Goodness, I'll see you around, then.

369
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,400
I'm sorry I took up your time. Goodbye.

370
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:48,590
Goodbye.

371
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:52,590

Ms. Lee!

374
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,090
Ms. Lee, were you really fired
from your publisher because of Who-joon?

375
00:23:12,170 --> 00:23:14,730
Are you victimizing yourself?
Are you just blaming him?

376
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:18,600
No, Who-joon is
clearly involved in my dismissal.

377
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,840
He said he'll embrace his anti-fan.

378
00:23:20,930 --> 00:23:22,340
Does this mean you were compensated?

379
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:23,610
-Compensation?
-Yes.

380
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:27,440
Don't you get what I'm saying?
I was only telling the truth.

381
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:28,980
Are you Who-joon's anti-fan?

382
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:30,740
Is that why you sent that email?

383
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:33,820
Yes, fine. I'm Who-joon's anti-fan.
I'm his anti-fan, okay?

384
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:38,040
If I have to be an anti-fan
to expose his true nature,

385
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,200
then fine, it's me.

386
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:48,120
Now, reporters,
I'm the one who knows his true nature,

387
00:23:48,210 --> 00:23:51,770
who suffered because of his duality,
and who can expose the truth!

-Wait!

There are many variety shows

It's better than an ordinary show.

in turning you into a star?

438
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,670
Just do as I say.
I have a good feeling about this.

I'm sure they offered good terms.

some of our rookies into the show?

Exactly.
He has to go out and do a great job

452

See? She's already surprised.

464

get to know each other,
and lift the misunderstanding.

466
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:02,130
And in the end, what we want to say is,
"We're all one."

467
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,460
Sounds great. "We're all one."

468
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:06,880
I can already imagine the ending scene.

469
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:10,050
The two of them will hold hands,
then a dole of doves will

470
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:11,590
-flutter up...
-Enough.

471
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:14,930
You already killed off 100 doves,
yet you still want that?

472
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:16,120
Throw in four more.

473
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:22,320
As you know,
you became the symbol of anti-fans.

474
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:23,780
But you know, it's not a bad thing.

475
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:26,280
That can happen if you two
don't know each other. Right?

476
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:28,130
Yes, I guess.

477
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:32,490
So that's why
a big-name, snooty entertainer will

478
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,420
try living with an ordinary person.

479
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:38,560
Do we just not understand each other?
Or was it better to remain as strangers?

480
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:43,270
If I'm the anti-fan,
is the entertainer Who-joon or what?

481
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,460
Correct.

482
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:46,480
Of course, it's Who-joon.

483
00:28:48,110 --> 00:28:50,090
Are you telling me to live with Who-joon?

484
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:51,230
Yes.

485
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:55,100
Geun-young, didn't you declare war
against Who-joon?

486
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:56,990
So how will you win against him?

487
00:28:57,570 --> 00:28:59,720
Geun-young, if you want to push off again,

488
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:02,710
you have to hit the rock bottom,
then kick yourself up from there.

489
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:08,960
I'm at a pretty low place in my life,

490
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:11,650
but I'm not at rock bottom.

491
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:15,430
I'm sure you'll find another anti-fan,
so look into that.

492
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:19,040
And since we've met already,
I'll make sure I watch the show.

493
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,660
We'll pay you way more than
anything you expect.

494
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,610
The all-time high.

495
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:31,360
(Group Chat: 3, Mi-jung: Everyone, come!)

496
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:33,690
(Su-hwan: Is it finally time for yukhoe?)

497
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:36,290
(Mi-jung: This barbecue restaurant is
very honest today!)

498
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:37,340
(Mi-jung)

499
00:29:37,430 --> 00:29:39,370
(Geun-young: Your employer is so honest.)

500
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:42,050
(But how can this celebrity be like this?)

501
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:44,120
(I got fired because of him.)

502
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,390
(Soo-hwan: May I say...)

503
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,710
(Geun-young: Don't say a word.)

504
00:29:46,890 --> 00:29:48,250
(Mi-jung: Isn't that show
your best chance?)

505
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:51,470
(Soo-hwan: Yes, you'll be able to take him
face-to-face.)

506
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:55,910
Hey, be practical, girl.
They said they'll pay you a lot too.

507
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,370
But living with that jerk? That's a bit...

508
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:00,400
Aren't you in dire need of money?

509
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:02,380
I am, but...

510
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,910
Then I'll come off as an anti-fan
who only wanted to make money.

511
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,550
Then let's be more realistic.

512
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,720
Realistically speaking,
you have to move out of here next week.

513
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:13,990
Next week? Why?

514
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,280
I told you that Shin-hyuk is moving in.

515
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:19,800
Right, and your mom asked me to tell you
that she'll cancel your lease.

516
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:22,270
She thinks it's not practical
to pay your rent.

517
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:23,890
I don't want to be practical.

518
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:26,840
Geun-young, it's about time
you accepted the reality.

519
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:29,440
Who knows? You might find a real lead

520
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:31,900
to how two-faced he is
as you live with him.

521
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:36,040
If you end up writing an amazing article,
you might get reinstated.

522
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:37,800
Is that so?

523
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:43,650
No, forget it. I've suffered enough
to know what he's like.

524
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:46,600
On top of that, I'm sure everyone
at the TV station is on his side.

525
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,140
They'll only make me look stupid.

526
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:51,130
Hey, you finally woke up to reality.

527
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:54,560
So how are you going to win
against someone that powerful?

528
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:57,820
At the least, you'll keep seeing him
if you shoot the show.

529
00:30:57,900 --> 00:31:01,780
And who knows?
Many reporters get their big break on TV.

530
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,640
Maybe this will be
a turning point in your life.

531
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:07,760
A turning point?

532
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,190
If I become famous,

533
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:16,690
then will people
listen to what I have to say?

534
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:24,130
Mr. Han, in that case,

535
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,330
I'll do it.

536
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,480
(Right? Doesn't it sound fun?)

537
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:31,650
I knew it. But Who-joon is out.

538
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,160
You're Who-joon's anti-fan,

539
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,590
so if he's out, we can't do this.

540
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:43,660
Mr. Han, then we just need him
to say yes, right?

541
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:45,690
When is the deadline?

542
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,010
-Remember that anti-fan?
-That woman?

543
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:53,040
-I can't believe her.
-She's unbelievable.

544
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,410
-What's she doing?
-Does she work here?

545
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:56,470
(May I help you?)

546
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,320
-I need to see Who-joon.
-She's the anti-fan.

547
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:00,430
(Please contact his manager.)

548
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:06,100
Hey, you need to leave.

549
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,060
(There are so many people
we end up running into in this world.)

550
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:16,660
(But that jerk is this hard to meet.)

551
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:21,370
(Does he really live in
a completely different world from mine?)

552
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:35,980
(What's he looking at?)

553
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:38,310
(Haven't you seen a crowded bus before?)

554
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:42,620
(What is this familiar feeling?)

555
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,900
(It's Who-joon!)

556
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:51,510
It's you!

557
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:12,010
(Grand Opening of the Gangnam Branch)

558
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:18,000
Are you sure Who-joon will be here?

559
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,370
I let you tag along,

560
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:21,870
but you can't cause any trouble.

561
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:24,510
I'm not the type who gets in trouble.

562
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:27,630
Anyway, don't worry about me.

563
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:30,230
You head over and earn your keep.

564
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:34,100
All right, then. See you later.

565
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:44,090
(Grand Opening of the Gangnam Branch)

566
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,130
My gosh.

567
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,410
-Do it with me.
-What is this?

568
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:10,400
No, I mean the TV show.

569
00:34:10,489 --> 00:34:11,679
You've heard, right?

570
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,300
Do the show with me.

571
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:14,980
The show?

572
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:17,750
Man, I never thought much of you,

573
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,600
but you said you'll do it?

574
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:23,030
Well, I mean,
we do have bad blood between us,

575
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,620
but the purpose of the show
didn't sound half-bad.

576
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:27,870
Aren't you just in need of money?

577
00:34:30,110 --> 00:34:31,210
Fine.

578
00:34:32,090 --> 00:34:35,610
Thanks to you, there's nothing more
I can do with my life.

579
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:37,110
I got fired,

580
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:40,540
and after I said I hated you,
everyone looks at me like I'm a pest,

581
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:42,610
so I can't even go around freely.

582
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:44,590
So take responsibility.

583
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:48,330
If you're that confident about yourself,
I say don't flee, but bring it on.

584
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:49,820
You're a guy with everything.

585
00:34:49,909 --> 00:34:52,239
The least you can do is
giving me a chance.

586
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,060
Not even in your dreams.

587
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,440
You and I will never meet again.

588
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:30,830
-I like it.
-Try this one too.

589
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,010
Yes, I'll be there soon.

590
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:39,060
Okay.

591
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,940
The first official anti-fan.

592
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:55,160
Wow, it's official.
Not everyone gets to have that.

593
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:57,450
That's why you're a top star.

594
00:35:58,070 --> 00:36:02,950
But what on earth happened on that day?

595
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:21,960
I thought she caught you doing something

596
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:24,250
to embrace her like that.

597
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:28,030
I mean, she's just a hater.
Why would you care so much about her?

598
00:36:28,910 --> 00:36:32,210
I heard you'll be embracing her
through a reality show too.

599
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,110
Rumors say that
the reporter turned it down,

600
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,280
so I was thought of someone in my agency.

601
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,020
Of course, it's In-hyung.

602
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,870
You know her.

603
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,890
Don't you know what the show is about?

604
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:51,130
She has to be an anti-fan.

605
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:53,640
I guess you didn't know.

606
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:57,510
In-hyung loathes you too.

607
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:02,480
Also, it'd be better to have someone
who has been on TV than a nobody.

608
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:04,550
Do you have to be so mean with your words?

609
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:07,890
You wouldn't want this to happen either.

610
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,610
Work is work.

611
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:15,640
Wait, does In-hyung
make you feel uncomfortable?

612
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:17,130
So you won't do it?

613
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:18,500
What if I won't?

614
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:22,240
Don't be like that.
You should help In-hyung get her break.

615
00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:24,660
You always hoped she'd make it big.

616
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:27,560
Go ahead and give them a proposal.

617
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,350
I already have a meeting
scheduled with the chief.

618
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:33,460
Don't worry about it.

619
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,100
It'll happen.

620
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:51,720
Wait!

621
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:55,760
Ji-hyang, remember that weird show?
Tell them that I'll do it.

622
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,840
However, it has to be that reporter.

623
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:02,100
All of a sudden? You don't have to do it.

624
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:05,930
Forget it.
I'll just get rid of her for good.

625
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:07,640
Goodbye.

626
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,090
Hey, pick up your phone.

627
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:17,500
Who is it?

628
00:38:18,510 --> 00:38:19,880
Director Han Jae-won?

629
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:23,920
Just tell him that I'm dead.

630
00:38:25,950 --> 00:38:27,050
Hello?

631
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:29,860
Geun-young is now...

632
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:33,870
I will. Okay.

633
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,310
Who-joon said yes.

634
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:41,700
-He said yes?
-Yes.

635
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:49,530
I guess Who-joon was curious about you.
After all, he changed his mind.

636
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,180
Here.

637
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,940
Read it through, then come.

638
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:09,070
Geun-young, this is your last chance.

639
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,620
I can't live the rest of my life
under false accusations.

640
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:12,540
I need to find the evidence.

641
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,660
(TV Show Appearance Contract)
I need to find the evidence.

642
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:17,210
Shouldn't there be a term
in case he injures me?

643
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:18,570
(The TV show may be canceled
for unavoidable reasons such as...)
Shouldn't there be a term
in case he injures me?

644
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:19,940
Shouldn't there be a term
in case he injures me?

645
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:23,540
Or in case he swears at me and beats me.

646
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:26,450
You know, for emotional
and physical assault.

647
00:40:05,470 --> 00:40:06,570
You.

648
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,080
Don't ever reach out to me again.

649
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:19,820
I'm very glad you two decided to do this.

650
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:22,850
Now that you've signed the contract,
you can't change your mind.

651
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:24,790
If you do,
then it'll be a breach of contract.

652
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,170
In that case, you'll have to pay the fee.

653
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:32,180
I'm sorry. I'm bad at empty talks.

654
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:33,720
This is the writer, Ms. No Do-yoon.

655
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:36,930
But it'd be funny

656
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:39,710
if you two want to quit
after getting into a huge fight on camera.

657
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:43,230
What are you talking about?
We haven't even started. Stop that.

658
00:40:43,970 --> 00:40:47,490
I hear somebody laughing.
I guess things are going smoothly.

659
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:48,990
Even our chief producer is here.

660
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,100
I knew our show was the next big one.

661
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:55,110
The Variety Show Department is
counting on this show.

662
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:56,650
Please do a great job for us.

663
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,640
No, I should ask you for help.

664
00:41:01,570 --> 00:41:04,740
She must be the anti-fan.

665
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:09,100
-I'm Lee Geun-young.
-Ms. Anti-fan, please make it great.

666
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:15,260
Come to think about it,
you two make a great couple.

667
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:18,600
Come on chief. That's not right.

668
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:21,280
What do you mean,
they make a great couple? Nonsense.

669
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:24,010
-I'm sorry.
-She's this honest.

670
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:27,000
She caught your empty talk.

671
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:28,240
She did.

672
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:33,470
I have to be at a meeting.

673
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,190
Make it good, then.

674
00:41:38,270 --> 00:41:41,130
How do you feel after your decision?
Doesn't it seem fun?

675
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:46,100
But I'm not really sure
what I'm supposed to do.

676
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:51,160
It's okay. You did your part already
after declaring yourself as his anti-fan.

677
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:55,910
Spend some time with him
and find out what he's really like.

678
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:58,550
-Okay?
-Look ahead.

679
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:29,350
Wait, we're showing this place on TV?

680
00:42:29,970 --> 00:42:32,480
I think Mr. Bae let them use it.

681
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:33,930
I'll be back.

682
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,040
What is this nonsense?

683
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:42,600
Why is everyone doing this to me?

684
00:42:48,890 --> 00:42:51,530
So you let them use this place
without asking me?

685
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:54,170
(CEO Bae Young-suk)
-What about it?
(-What do you mean?)

686
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:55,840
Don't you remember
giving this place to me?

687
00:42:55,930 --> 00:42:58,660
No, I said it's as good as yours.

688
00:42:58,740 --> 00:43:00,720
It's not yours yet.
It's the agency's place.

689
00:43:00,810 --> 00:43:03,410
We never changed the title or anything.

690
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:07,020
Then you lied to me
when you said it's mine.

691
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:10,140
It's not like you live there now.
Why is it so bad?

692
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:12,820
(I mean, did you hide something there?)

693
00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:15,950
He hung up on me again.

694
00:43:17,750 --> 00:43:20,960
Joon, we have no choice.
Let's go inside for now.

695
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:22,940
Come on out.

696
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:34,820
(The door is opened.)

697
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:36,490
Come on in.

698
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:45,290
And the lights are...

699
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:49,080
My gosh.

700
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:52,290
This place is huge.

701
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,150
Look at the second floor.

702
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,930
They can't go on the second floor.

703
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:00,120
Okay.

704
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:05,010
Let's keep the shooting
just on the first floor.

705
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:08,570
Let's do that. It'll be too complicated
to show the second floor too.

706
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:10,900
Okay. Do you want to take a look?

707
00:44:11,030 --> 00:44:12,490
-Sure.
-This way, please.

708
00:44:14,030 --> 00:44:17,060
This is the bedroom area.

709
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:21,240
And this is the bathroom.

710
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:25,990
What is this place?

711
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:27,970
There's a private sauna here.

712
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:30,220
Joon really loves doing sauna.

713
00:44:30,310 --> 00:44:33,560
We practically built this house
around this sauna.

714
00:44:33,650 --> 00:44:36,550
I feel bad for putting up cameras
in this fancy house.

715
00:44:37,740 --> 00:44:38,840
It looks awesome.

716
00:44:40,730 --> 00:44:42,190
You have a great place.

717
00:44:42,270 --> 00:44:43,770
-Goodness.
-Mr. Han, the curtains.

718
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,640
So some people live in a place like this.

719
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:49,400
It's very empty, right?

720
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:51,950
It's because no one lives here now.

721
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:53,140
I see.

722
00:44:53,670 --> 00:44:55,430
We started off on the wrong foot,

723
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:58,640
but please take good care of Joon.

724
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:00,620
Why would she take care of me?

725
00:45:00,710 --> 00:45:03,080
And since you don't have a manager,

726
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,370
please call me if something happens.

727
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:08,060
Are you crazy?
Why would you be her manager?

728
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:10,480
He's just being stubborn.

729
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:13,730
Also, just in case,

730
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:16,280
let me have your number too.

731
00:45:16,370 --> 00:45:19,450
Of course.
I guess some people can be very nice.

732
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:22,440
-Sorry?
-No, nothing.

733
00:45:22,530 --> 00:45:24,780
-I can hear you.
-That's me.

734
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:26,620
-You can take a look around.
-Okay.

735
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:32,960
This is why adults said
you need to have good friends.

736
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:35,560
I can hear you.

737
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,420
The library is great too.

738
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:42,160
This house is more than fine.

739
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:43,830
We'll just have to begin shooting.

740
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:48,180
Mr. Han, please make sure
this location stays concealed.

741
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:50,740
The passcode is 0227.

742
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:52,500
Keep this between you two.

743
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:54,210
Don't worry about that.

744
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:58,170
All right, then.
We have a meeting, so we have to go.

745
00:45:58,260 --> 00:45:59,800
See you at the first shooting.

746
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:01,560
Geun-young, you'll leave, right?

747
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:03,280
Yes, of course.

748
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:06,620
The house is great,
but the air doesn't seem too fresh.

749
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:08,820
What? Really?

750
00:46:09,390 --> 00:46:11,200
("The Constitution," "Criminal Code...")

751
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:19,030
Mi-jung, I finally signed the contract...

752
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:22,420
Right, he's moving in today.

753
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:23,740
Did it go well?

754
00:46:24,310 --> 00:46:25,410
I guess.

755
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:27,960
-Hello.
-Hello.

756
00:46:28,050 --> 00:46:29,760
I was too surprised last time. I'm sorry.

757
00:46:29,850 --> 00:46:31,260
Don't say that. I should apologize.

758
00:46:31,350 --> 00:46:33,280
No, I'm sorry.

759
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:37,550
Right, Geun-young.
I heard you'll be on a show.

760
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:42,520
Then will you really
live with Who-joon and stuff?

761
00:46:42,610 --> 00:46:46,830
No way. Why would I live with him?

762
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:50,000
I'm not actually living with him.
That's the concept of the show.

763
00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:51,370
-It's just the theme.
-The theme.

764
00:46:51,450 --> 00:46:52,550
You're so cute.

765
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:57,130
You're so adorable.

766
00:46:57,830 --> 00:47:00,430
This is how naive Shin-hyuk is.

767
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:05,180
He thought you'll really live with him
when you told him about the show.

768
00:47:05,710 --> 00:47:08,390
No, they actually do the shooting.

769
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:10,990
Look. Geun-young, look.

770
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:14,910
On "Three Meals a Day,"
the cast lived together.

771
00:47:14,990 --> 00:47:19,310
Also, on dating shows like "Love Signal,"
they all live there together too.

772
00:47:19,390 --> 00:47:20,490
Babe.

773
00:47:21,070 --> 00:47:23,710
Did you only watch TV instead of studying?

774
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:27,710
No, that's not what I...

775
00:47:28,110 --> 00:47:30,480
I didn't just watch TV.

776
00:47:31,490 --> 00:47:34,440
Then I should start packing now.

777
00:47:34,530 --> 00:47:35,760
Packing?

778
00:47:35,850 --> 00:47:37,870
You don't have a place to go.

779
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:39,630
You should stay here.

780
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,350
What are you talking about?

781
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,950
I mean, it'll be fun
if the three of us lived together.

782
00:47:44,030 --> 00:47:46,190
-Right, Shin-hyuk?
-Yes.

783
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:49,890
Yes, of course. I'm freeloading too.

784
00:47:49,970 --> 00:47:51,470
See? It's fine.

785
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:54,640
It's not fine.
It'll make Shin-hyuk uncomfortable.

786
00:47:54,730 --> 00:47:56,840
He won't be uncomfortable.

787
00:47:56,930 --> 00:47:58,550
We can stay in the room...

788
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:00,140
The room?

789
00:48:00,230 --> 00:48:03,220
No, we, as in the two of us.

790
00:48:03,310 --> 00:48:06,170
He can sleep in the living room. Yes.

791
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:09,290
Let's party through the night, then.

792
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:10,480
Okay? Pick it up.

793
00:48:11,090 --> 00:48:13,730
Cheers!

794
00:48:14,090 --> 00:48:16,550
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

♫ I wonder what is love ♫

796
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:36,260
♫ I wanna know what is love ♫

797
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:39,910
♫ That sweet flavor ♫

798
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:44,710
♫ But what is this dark flavor? ♫

799
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:48,540
♫ I wonder what is love ♫

800
00:48:48,930 --> 00:48:53,680
♫ There's no answer
to this sweet question ♫

801
00:48:53,770 --> 00:49:01,160
♫ But still, I'm falling in love ♫

802
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:05,830
♫ Love hid somewhere ♫

803
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:10,100
♫ But from the moment I met you ♫

804
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:14,320
♫ My love gets bigger and bigger ♫

805
00:49:14,410 --> 00:49:18,280
♫ So there's no way I can hide it ♫

806
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:22,060
♫ Whenever I think of you ♫

807
00:49:22,770 --> 00:49:27,170
♫ I begin to wonder if this is love ♫

808
00:49:27,560 --> 00:49:31,390
♫ I think I like you ♫

809

♫ I do, yeah, I do ♫

810

♫ I wonder what is love ♫

811
00:49:49,830 --> 00:49:50,930
Wait.

812
00:49:51,850 --> 00:49:53,390
Are they still drinking?

813
00:49:54,050 --> 00:49:58,670
Do you know how happy I am
now that I'm living with you?

814
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:01,840
Me too. Do you know how happy I am?

815
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:05,760
Do you know that I can't live without you?

816
00:50:05,930 --> 00:50:09,500
Me too. I can't live without you either.

817
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:10,770
-Really?
-Yes, really.

818
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:13,980
-Really?
-Really!

819
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,440
Honey, there's a mosquito here.
Let's go inside.

820
00:50:19,530 --> 00:50:21,020
We can't.

821
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:24,590
Geun-young will wake up.

822
00:50:24,850 --> 00:50:27,230
Then let's sleep together
in the living room.

823
00:50:27,310 --> 00:50:28,590
We can't do that either!

824
00:50:28,850 --> 00:50:31,580
We'll make Geun-young feel uncomfortable.

825
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:33,960
Go away!

826
00:50:34,050 --> 00:50:38,010
No, Geun-young is my friend.

827
00:50:38,090 --> 00:50:42,760
No, not her. The mosquito.
Go away, mosquito.

828
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:44,300
Hi, everyone.

829
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,370
Are you all watching the concert?

830
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:49,490
Checking in with all of you in real-time

831
00:50:49,930 --> 00:50:52,700
makes me feel like
I'm with all my fans around the world.

832
00:50:53,010 --> 00:50:54,290
Are you having fun?

833
00:50:55,250 --> 00:50:59,210
If you have any questions for me
or wanted to tell me something,

834
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:00,930
then can you ask away starting now?

835
00:51:02,250 --> 00:51:05,770
YAMA. Right, "YAMA"?

836
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:07,530
(You still don't know?)

837
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:10,650
-I hope he tells us.
(-Goodness, it's not hard.)

838
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:14,130
(I know you'll be able to figure it out.)

839
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:15,800
I have to get prepared for the next song.

840
00:51:34,550 --> 00:51:36,480
Where do you think you're going?

841
00:51:37,670 --> 00:51:41,410
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm staying by Mi-jung's side.

842
00:51:41,980 --> 00:51:43,080
Mi-jung.

843
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:46,650
Mi-jung.

844
00:51:47,310 --> 00:51:48,760
I hope you two will be happy.

845
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:24,400
Okay. I'll light a few candles

846
00:52:25,230 --> 00:52:27,300
and hold out for a few days.

847
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:32,360
I'm home!

848
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:43,890
What's going on?

849
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:52,730
What? She really canceled the lease?

850
00:52:53,390 --> 00:52:54,490
When?

851
00:52:54,890 --> 00:52:57,350
I don't know the exact date.

852
00:52:57,970 --> 00:52:59,990
(You should call your mother.)

853
00:53:00,700 --> 00:53:02,940
Mom, did you really cancel my lease?

854
00:53:03,070 --> 00:53:04,570
Didn't I mention it to you?

855
00:53:04,830 --> 00:53:08,620
Goodness, I've been out of it lately.

856
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:11,960
Mom, you can't forget
about stuff like that.

857
00:53:12,050 --> 00:53:15,610
Now that you found out,
you can move back home.

858
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:19,880
I got a new job.
So send my stuff to Mi-jung's place.

859
00:53:19,970 --> 00:53:25,200
Goodness, she's as feisty as her dad.

860
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:36,420
Leave Geun-young's stuff alone.
She wants it back.

861
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:40,030
But clean up everything we don't need.

862
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:44,260
Our storage is
full of things we don't need.

863
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:48,740
It's because you're easily convinced,
so you always buy useless things.

864
00:53:48,830 --> 00:53:52,920
Yes, it's weird.
I knew we needed it when I bought these.

865
00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:56,490
Why would we need a set of biographies?

866
00:53:56,930 --> 00:53:58,860
I'll send these to Geun-young.

00:54:27,110 --> 00:54:28,430
What are you looking at?

872
00:54:29,050 --> 00:54:31,420
Your life will get hectic
once you leave your home.

873
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:33,050
I know that too.

874
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:35,290
I want to go home, darn it.

875
00:54:55,490 --> 00:54:57,730
-Hey.
(-Where did you go?)

876
00:54:57,820 --> 00:54:59,320
You don't have a place to go.

877
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,520
You'll wake up your neighbors.

878
00:55:01,610 --> 00:55:03,890
Didn't you know
how I'm wanted by many people?

879
00:55:04,730 --> 00:55:06,270
If I had no idea, then there's no one.

880
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:08,070
How dare you lie to me?

881
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:09,480
I mean it.

882
00:55:10,670 --> 00:55:13,620
I told one of my seniors
about my situation

883
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:15,200
after you mentioned Shin-hyuk.

884
00:55:15,290 --> 00:55:18,190
I forgot to mention it to you
after we had a drink.

885
00:55:18,370 --> 00:55:20,700
Really?
Then give me her address and number.

886
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:22,860
(Hey, I'm not a kid.)

887
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:27,830
So make sure
you and Shin-hyuk get along well.

888
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:31,610
But still, the three of us
could've lived here together.

889
00:55:32,230 --> 00:55:34,080
You'd feel awkward at a senior's place.

890
00:55:34,830 --> 00:55:37,860
(Are you sure
you're going to your senior's place?)

891
00:55:37,950 --> 00:55:40,590
Yes, I am, girl. Why would I lie to you?

892
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:43,360
Okay. Call me if anything happens.

893
00:55:43,450 --> 00:55:44,550
