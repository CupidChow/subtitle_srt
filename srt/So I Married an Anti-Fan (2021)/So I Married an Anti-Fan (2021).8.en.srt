00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:11,230
Come at me.

12
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:14,970
I...

13
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:18,670
Let's go.

14
00:03:58,650 --> 00:03:59,750
Wait.

15
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:12,380
-When did I drop this?
-How can you throw away my gift?

16
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,280
What gift?
You just bought it for the show.

17
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:18,579
Man, you fool. You can't buy that now
even if you want to.

18
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:20,600
My name is on it now.
It's the Who-joon premium.

19
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:23,020
Okay, sure.
I should sell it off while I can.

20
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,650
You're thinking of selling my gift?

21
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:28,870
My gosh. You're patronizing me over this
meaningless thing? What's with you?

22
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,690
Hey, I can
just put a meaningful spin on it.

23
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:35,030
Think of it
as your early birthday present.

24
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,200
How does he know my birthday?

25
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:39,790
What?

26
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,280
Nothing.

27
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,420
-Goodbye.
-Thanks!

28

Who-joon premium?

29
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,950
I told you to wait there.
Why were you outside?

30
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:00,160
You seemed to be running late.

31
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,750
Why? Did you suddenly want
to stand in the rain without an umbrella?

32
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,150
Anyhow.

33
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:13,270
You can never trust
the weather report these days.

34
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,820
It's now getting sunny again.

35
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,520
That's why you should
always carry an umbrella with you.

36
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:22,470
Don't get caught in the rain.

37
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,210
A little rain is not that bad.

38
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:29,290
Right. You've always been the type

39
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:33,159
who makes people
want to put an umbrella over you.

40
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:41,650
Jae-joon, may I update my profile photos?

41
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,770
My current one is a little too old,
so it doesn't look good.

42
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:52,560
Can't you talk to your manager about that?

43
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:56,350
Why do I have to mind every little detail
when I'm the CEO?

00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,440
Well, yes.

-So? Are you saying it's bad?
-But we can't help it.

64
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:14,220
We need to show how cool Who-joon is
to get people hooked.

65
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:17,570
Okay, then. That's episode two.

66
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:20,960
Anyway, are you going to release
Who-joon's behind-the-scenes clips?

67
00:07:21,350 --> 00:07:23,640
Never mind. His agency won't confirm that.

68
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:25,360
If they try to stop us,

69
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,380
we can trick them.

70
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,140
Goodness.

71
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:33,540
I guess people in this industry are
infamous for their disobedience.

72

Goodness. Hey,

74
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,640
both Who-joon
and his agency are in this industry.

75
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,820
Would they listen?

76
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,460
-No, I guess.
-No.

77
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:50,040
Come to think of it,
Geun-young is the only one who isn't.

78
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:00,340
But why do I keep getting concerned
about that lady?

79
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,180
Why can't you be concerned about me?

80
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:06,850
Well, you're just another disobedient guy
in this industry.

81
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,740
-You are too.
-I know that.

82
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:15,560

someone else is concerned too.

-Who-joon?

Really?

85
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:26,690
And?

86
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:29,020
(Great work.)

87
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,870
I'll publish the article in two days.

88

Okay. Make it good for me.

89
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:34,880
Sure. How's the variety show going?

90
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:37,960
It's all right, I guess.

91
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,799
Is it because she got too much attention?

92
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:43,539
I heard Geun-young has been doing
interviews to be a reporter again.

93
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:46,400
Really?

94
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:50,010
But I guess she should
think about what she'll do after the show.

95
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,240
Okay, great work.

96
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:53,220
-Let's talk again later.
-Bye.

97
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:56,170
It looks like
the crew rented out Club Benny

98
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,930
for this week's shooting.

99
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,250
Why did it have to be there?

100
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,790
Right? We should switch it out.

101
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,910
But we don't have a good reason.

102
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,920
I got it for now.

103
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:09,550
Okay.

104
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,680
Why isn't Who-joon coming?

105
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:22,700
He already left.

106
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,050
You get sick of him when he's cranky,

107
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:28,250
but he gets on your mind
when you don't see him, right?

108
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:29,430
What?

109
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:31,330
No, not at all.

110
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:33,830
Baby, you better watch out.

111
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:37,880
No cleansing cream could save you
if you fall for those made-up stars.

112
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,210
You can never forget them either.

113
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:43,950
I didn't fall for him. My gosh.

114
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:48,930
Geun-young.

115
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,330
Hello.

116
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,670
So, we aren't shooting here today?

117
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,830
We're going to go out,
but the venue we got

118
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:58,210
has no place for you to get ready.

119
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:01,990
One second.

120
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,240
Yes, Mr. Han.

121
00:10:05,210 --> 00:10:06,570
But Ra-ra, that's really not it.

122
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,330
Come on, it's all right.

123
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,840
It's not the case. What's all right?

124
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:13,080
You're being weird.

125
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:14,800
It really isn't the case.

126
00:10:23,470 --> 00:10:25,140
(Club Benny)

127
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:27,650
I can't believe
I came back here for a shoot.

128
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:30,200
(Club Benny)

129
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,010
You need to apologize before you go.

130
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:36,050
You should've behaved
when I was being patient!

131
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:40,980
I guess it's a "meant to be".

132
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:48,240
Oh no.

133
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:51,140
Geun-young, I'm sorry.

134
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:54,180
Who-joon got into a car accident
on his way here.

135
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:56,290
An accident?

136
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:59,190
Have you heard? One second.

137
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:03,420
Yes, exactly. What happened to his car?

138
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,620
-How can this be?
-Is he hurt badly?

139
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,850
Where's the hospital?

140
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,360
We're looking into it.
Let's give it some time.

141
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,630
I'll get right back to you.

142
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,440
-Where are you?
-Let's sit and wait.

143
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:14,200
-Where's the hospital?
-Wait here.

144
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,060
Oh my...

145
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:22,420
What should I do?

146
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:30,920
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

147
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:35,890
♫ Happy birthday to you ♫

148
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,580
Did I surprise you?

149
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,620
I thought you got into an accident.

150
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,120
I almost did.

151
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,490
The traffic could've made
a broadcast accident.

152
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,530
What? You can't joke around like that.

153
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,200
I wanted to throw you a surprise.

154
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:52,740
Here, blow these out.

155
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,740
Happy birthday.

156
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:06,290
-Congratulations!
-Surprise!

157
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:08,180
-Happy birthday.
-Congrats!

158
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,990
How did you all know?

159
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,920
This is your birthday present.

160
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,920
Here.

161
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,840
I wasn't sure of your size,
but please try them on.

162
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,900
It's okay, they fit well.

163
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:28,250
It's all right.

164
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,370
-They're pretty.
-They are.

165
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:34,670
-They're so pretty!
-Happy birthday.

166
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:39,950
-Happy birthday.
-Thank you.

167
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,620
Happy birthday, Geun-young.

168
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:52,050
(Benny)

169
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:53,590
We're shooting my profile here?
(Benny)

170
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,720
That and to make a surprise visit.

171
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:58,480
A surprise visit?

172
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:00,630
Yes, there's a thing.

173
00:13:02,130 --> 00:13:03,530
I think the shooting team is here.

174
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,560
Let's go.

175
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:08,990
This is so unfair.

176
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:11,410
I was so surprised thinking it was real.

177
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:15,060
Remember the prank cam last time?
Why are you fooled so easily?

178
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:19,370
I mean, Mr. Han, Ms. No,
and everyone else is good at acting.

179
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,010
Geun-young and Who-joon.

180
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,870
Here's the second surprise for the day.

181
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,440
I invited special guests
for our special cast.

182
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:30,460
Shall we? Guests, please.

183
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,350
Surprise.

184
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,480
Happy birthday.

185
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:39,000
Oh, yes. Hello.

186
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,720
What are you doing?

187
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:45,910
It's a surprise.

188
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:47,310
Mr. Han, one second, please.

189
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,500
Why?

190
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:51,410
Look at him.
I think they're really surprised.

191
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:54,090
-What brings you here?
-Right.

192
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,600
I came to take In-hyung's profile photos,

193
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,580
but they called me that there's a shoot

194
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,600
for Geun-young's birthday.

195
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:04,340
Doesn't this seem genuinely real?

196
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,810
-What are the chances?
-Tell me about it.

197
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:09,710
Well, the three of us
know each other very well,

198
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,040
and we've met Geun-young
from time to time.

199
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:14,460
Geun-young, you've met In-hyung, right?

200
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:16,050
She's a singer at my agency.

201
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:18,640
-Hello.
-Hi.

202
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,220
What's wrong?

203
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,080
The shoes are a little too small.

204
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:27,750
-Are you okay?
-I'm fine.

205
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,910
-Are you all right?
-Sorry.

206
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,650
Happy birthday, Geun-young.

207
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:42,090
Cheers.

208
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,540
Why didn't you tell me?

209
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,350
I didn't know until I got here.

210
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:55,210
I prepared some stuff when I heard that

211
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:57,760
it's your birthday. Do you like it?

212
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:00,350
Yes, it's wonderful. Thank you.

213
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:05,680
Hey, Joon. Do you remember what we did
on In-hyung's birthday long ago?

214
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:09,900
Back then, we didn't know
what to prepare for birthdays.

215
00:15:10,830 --> 00:15:13,860
Right, was it just you two?

216
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,020
No, you two got me cake

217
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:22,310
and sang for me too.

218
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,020
That's what's special.

219
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:28,910
I was really young back then.

220
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,300
So they were both very nice to me.

221
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,570
I see.

222
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,200
Do you both remember?

223
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:38,540
We had an unbelievable amount
of tteokbokki on her birthday

224
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:40,000
because it's her favorite.

225
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,310
You must like tteokbokki, In-hyung.

226
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,540
I love it too.

227
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:51,700
Do you really?

228
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:53,810
We should go eat some together.

229
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,000
Okay.

230
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,520
I feel a little bad for Joon,

231
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:01,560
but I became
such a huge fan of Geun-young's.

232
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:02,880
Doesn't she seem so real?

233
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:05,520
She seems to love hangover soup.
So down to earth.

234
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,580
That's why I gave this a thought.

235
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:12,420
I think she could make
an official debut as a TV celebrity.

236
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:14,980
Come on, don't say that.

237
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,920
We're looking for rookies, you know.

238
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,640
The restroom is...

239
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:30,730
There it is.

240
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,600
I knew it. It's really confusing
to find a restroom in this place.

241
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:39,040
I'm glad he got me these,

242
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:41,200
but why didn't he ask for my size?

243
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,400
My gosh.

244
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,160
Does Joon treat you nicely?

245
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:15,300
We're just on TV together.

246
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,490
You also seem to know my CEO well.

247
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:21,900
Oh, Jae-joon?

248
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:25,550
You know his real name too?

249
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,750
You two must be close.

250
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:29,600
Are we?

251
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:31,670
We've just met here and there.

252
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:36,420
He doesn't talk about me, does he?

253
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,530
Which one?

254
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,380
I guess he doesn't.

255
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:42,970
Let's go.

256
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:58,330
You saw us on that day, didn't you?

257
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,940
(Party Tonight: Club Benny Opening Party)

258
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:08,410
Right. Yes.

259
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:12,320
We've met more often than I thought.
Back in Japan too.

260
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:16,330
I forgot to tell Who-joon
that you were at the hotel in the morning.

261
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,480
It's okay.

262
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:22,440
I left my phone in there.
You should go first.

263
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,980
-So this is where you two met.
-Sorry?

264
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:38,810
I meant your awful fate with Joon.
That shoe throw.

265
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,000
Right.

266
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:42,860
Old memories.

267
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,050
Did you see him with In-hyung on that day?

268
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:52,450
What? I'm not sure.

269
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:53,640
You seem flustered.

270
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:58,830
Wait, you must know
about Joon and In-hyung's history.

271
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,270
I see. That's why she was at the hotel.

272
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,780
Well, now everyone knows.

273
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:06,970
I...

274
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,340
Wait.

275
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:36,450
Hey, don't take it the wrong way.

276
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,570
-It's not like that.
-Do you expect me to believe that?

277
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,080
You said there's more than meets the eye.

278
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:45,600
That's exactly what this is.
What you saw isn't the whole story.

279
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:47,890
If you're worried about what others say,
face it yourself.

280
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,160
Why do you run like a coward?

281
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:50,620
What? A coward?

282
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:53,870
What about you? You spread rumors
even though you know nothing.

283
00:20:11,910 --> 00:20:15,210
You went to see him at the hotel?

284
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:21,550
Is going there to see him
your idea of not caring about him?

285
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,020
Things that you can't tell me proudly,

286
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:27,620
are not things that you don't care about.

287
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:30,660
You don't talk about me proudly either.

288
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:34,090
-What?
-What about you?

289
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,240
You don't talk to anyone about me.

290
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,940
You don't know what it feels like

291
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,280
to have to hide every time.

292
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,160
You're both the same.

293
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:03,130
Geun-young, your feet.

294
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,890
Were the shoes too small?

295
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:07,620
They looked too big last time.

296
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:09,820
You must've gotten those.

297
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:13,030
And this is how I get caught.

298
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,330
It really doesn't seem to click.

299
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:18,700
Both the shoes and this place.

300
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:22,220
Anyway, why is Who-joon
in such a bad mood?

301
00:21:22,310 --> 00:21:24,780
He's the one who suggested
we throw you a birthday party.

302
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,710
I don't get it.

303
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:30,540
He was so thrilled about it. You know.

304
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:34,590
-I'll get going.
-Okay, bye.

305
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,480
You don't even know.

306
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:02,350
Sir, can you drop me off here?

307
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,540
Sure.

308
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,030
I'll ask them

309
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,110
to edit out what we shot today.
Don't mind it.

310
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,280
Okay. Bye.

311
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,600
(I need to see you for a second.)

312

(Nari Pharmacy)

313
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,830
Goodbye.

314
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,460
Hello.

315
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:50,750
Well, I need ointment, bandage,

316
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,200
and what else do I need?

317
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:54,450
-What do you need it for?
-A scratch.

318
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:56,730
-Where at?
-My heels.

319
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,890
Wrong size shoes?

320
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:01,930
Things that don't fit
always become a problem.

321
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:09,580
"Things that don't fit
always become a problem."

322
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,510
I think I got way too much.

323

(Who-joon)

324
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:43,460
(I really didn't.)

326
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,140
(I'm not that nasty.)

327
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,860
If I want to avoid such chaos,

328
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,580
I should move out of here first.

329
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,760
Darn you.

330
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,200
What are you doing?

331
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:37,890
Did you think I didn't know
you two were seeing each other?

332
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:42,330
I don't know what Geun-young said,

333
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,400
but it's not what you think it is.

334
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:45,810
Lee Geun-young?

335
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,160
She's also very naive.

336
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,580
She got startled at once.

337
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,700
But

338
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:57,820
do you know what's funnier?

339
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,900
You two.

340
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:07,060
I've known you two
since when we were all young.

341
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:09,610
If you two put on a mask
and play innocent,

342
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:13,570
did you think
I won't be able to tell by your face?

343
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:15,860
If you two keep doing this,

344
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:19,910
will you get a grip
only after you see how wrecked she gets?

345
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,280
Enough is enough!

346
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,530
What are you so afraid of?

347
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,640
You got everything you wanted.

348
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:28,180
When will you ever stop?

349
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:35,920
Afraid?

350
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:37,510
Why would I be afraid?

351
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,710
You're the one who's afraid.

352
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,440
You couldn't even protect your girl,

353
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:45,520
and now you want to be
that guy who worries for her.

354
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,070
But you're afraid I'll destroy that too.

355
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,130
That's why you should...

356
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:58,190
at least just take a beating
when I get mad.

357
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:03,950
That's the only way
In-hyung will get some work, right?

358
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:11,210
You little jerk.

359
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,610
(The door is opened.)

360
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:15,230
(The door is locked.)

361
00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:21,700
Can you be gentle?

362
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:22,890
Deal with it.

363
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,930
Did you fall? Like a kid?

364
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,770
I'm not a kid. Why would I fall?

365
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,210
Then what? Did you get into a fight?

366
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:36,970
I'm not a kid. Why would I fight anyone?

367
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:39,340
You obviously look like you were beaten.

368
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,720
It probably came in this way.

369
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,330
What's that?

370
00:27:49,990 --> 00:27:51,530
Why? Are you finally moving out?

371
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,250
I'm leaving before I get kicked out.

372
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,190
Just stay.

373
00:28:03,150 --> 00:28:04,250
Stay here.

374
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:26,820
You look...

375
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,030
really mean up close.

376
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:40,680
Do you have any soju?

377
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,540
You saw her, right?

378
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,620
The girl who stood there in the rain
in Okinawa was

379
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,690
the girl who I couldn't protect.

380
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:11,740
I figured so,

381
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,440
but I really didn't tell him.

382
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,620
I know.

383
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:20,280
Please forget the mean things

384
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,180
I said before.

385
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,910
I can't just forget stuff as told.

386
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:29,120
You already know that I hold grudges.

387
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,930
I made a choice to protect everyone.

388
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,680
Yet I couldn't protect anybody

389
00:29:46,150 --> 00:29:47,640
and ended up hurting everyone.

390
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,620
It's because I wasn't good enough.

391
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:57,410
So even if you find out anything about me,

392
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:01,860
pretend like you don't know.

393
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,440
No matter how much I hate you,

394
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,100
I don't spread rumors of other's past
like some cheap person.

395
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:14,530
You already know I'm not that tenacious.

396
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:43,520
You're up.

397
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:46,950
-You're here.
-I got you macchiato today!

398
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:51,840
What's with your face? What happened?

399
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:55,620
It's nothing.

400
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:57,510
I try my best to keep my precious kid

401
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:00,200
away from scratches, but look at you!
It's not nothing!

402
00:31:00,810 --> 00:31:01,910
Wait.

403
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:07,460
Was it Jae-joon?

404
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,800
It was.

405
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,220
-That little jerk.
-Ji-hyang.

406
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:15,380
Just pretend like you don't know.

407
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:17,490
My gosh.

408
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,610
Let me see you.
How's the bruise? Did you get it treated?

409
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,310
It's fine. I'm not a kid.

410
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,770
This isn't good.
I'll cancel all your schedules.

411
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:29,020
Don't go out for a while. Okay?

412
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:31,310
This is heartbreaking.

413
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:40,370
The headquarters told you, right?

414
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:43,100
You're now our lawyer as well.

415
00:31:43,190 --> 00:31:47,850
Yes, I heard that the chairman gave
direct orders to our firm's CEO.

416
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,270
-The contract?
-Right.

417
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:53,610
We looked over the contract,
then edited it as you requested.

418
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:57,050
You added that part on penalty, right?

419
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:58,890
He has to pay tenfold of his front money

420
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,570
if he does anything to damage his image,

421
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:02,410
and his front money is unprecedented.

422
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:05,710
But Who-joon is very good
at keeping his image well.

423
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,850
If he has a great image,

424
00:32:10,990 --> 00:32:12,530
I can always destroy it.

425
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:13,720
Sorry?

426
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,540
No, nothing.

427
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:20,720
Then I look forward
to receiving your help.

428
00:32:20,810 --> 00:32:22,080
Of course.

429
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:23,270
-Please excuse me.
-Sure.

430
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:32,900
Now, it's my turn to keep my image great.

431
00:32:39,810 --> 00:32:40,910
Geun-young.

432
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:42,500
Yes, Jae-joon.

433
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:46,150
It's about yesterday.
Should we meet up and talk?

434
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:47,950
Where should we meet?

435
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:52,440
I thought it'd be better
to see you here than outside.

436
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:53,540
I see.

437
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:55,870
You're the CEO.

438
00:32:55,870 --> 00:32:56,710
(Spigen Entertainment, CEO Choi Jae-joon)
You're the CEO.

439
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:57,500
(Spigen Entertainment, CEO Choi Jae-joon)

440
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:00,230
I'm up higher than you expected, right?

441
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:01,590
Yes.

442
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:04,670
We became more awkward after yesterday.

443
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:06,170
You're right.

444
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:10,170
I'm sorry for putting you
in a tight spot yesterday.

445
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:13,910
I just brought it up
thinking you already knew about them.

446
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:17,390
I didn't think
Joon would get that furious.

447
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:22,710
Well, I understand how he could hate
me knowing about his past.

448
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,560
I see.

449
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,960
It looks like you've made up with him.

450
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:32,170
There was nothing to make up.

451
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:37,190
You only understand
his situation, don't you?

452
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,900
That's a little disappointing.

453
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:44,620
What? No, it's not like that.

454
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:49,770
But to be honest, I don't really know

455
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,630
what's going on between you three.

456
00:33:54,790 --> 00:33:55,890
Right.

457
00:33:57,560 --> 00:33:59,100
As I said before,

458
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:01,480
we were very close before our debut.

459
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:05,300
And of course, only I knew
about In-hyung and Joon's relationship.

460
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:09,000
But everything changed since his debut.

461
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:13,179
In-hyung and I thought he abandoned us.

462
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:15,820
I see.

463
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:18,989
Is that why you still hate him so much?

464
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:25,590
The problem is that
In-hyung came to be with me after he left.

465
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,840
That's why Joon and I
can never be friends again.

466
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:34,520
All I want is for In-hyung
to never be hurt by him again.

467
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:39,929
I know that everything I did
could be out of inferiority.

468
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:44,420
Everything he does becomes special
and gets labeled with a premium.

469
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,500
Putting his name on it.

470
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:51,239
You don't understand me, do you?

471
00:34:51,409 --> 00:34:53,750
What? No.

472
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:55,730
It's not like that.

473
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:01,930
Then can we continue to be friends?

474
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:04,170
-Sure.
-Really?

475
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:06,590
My gosh.

476
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:10,550
I was really worried
after what happened yesterday.

477
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:17,150
Mr. Choi is with a guest right now.

478
00:35:18,690 --> 00:35:20,940
Who's the guest?

479
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:23,140
Ms. Lee Geun-young.

480
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:26,440
I see.

481
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:30,840
Do you want something to eat?
I have lots of stuff.

482
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:02,390
-Hello?
(-Why aren't you home?)

483
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:04,060
I'm on my way. Why?

484
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,770
-Come quickly.
-So why...

485
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:11,450
You always hang up right away
after you're done with yourself.

486
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:20,730
(The door is locked.)

487
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:27,160
Where are you?

488
00:36:27,910 --> 00:36:29,010
What's going on?

489
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:33,010
-Hello?
-Hey, are you back?

490
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:35,170
Yes, I thought you were here.

491
00:36:36,130 --> 00:36:37,540
Come to the basement parking lot.

492
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:39,830
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

493
00:36:41,850 --> 00:36:43,700
What? What's with him?

494
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:48,760
Hurry!

495
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:52,680
-Take this.
-Why? What is it?

496
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,450
-We have to go. We're late.
-Where are we going?

497
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:58,220
I'm not kidnapping you, so just hop on.

498
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:37,950
What's this place?
Why is everyone lined up and waiting?

499
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:44,110
Today is the release
of a very important game.

500
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:47,680
Oh, a game. So you're here to get that?

501
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:50,890
No, I already pre-ordered it. But,

502
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:53,260
they give out the soundtrack
only if you come in person.

503
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:54,940
And that's really rare.

504
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:57,840
We just have ten more hours to wait.

505
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:01,050
-Are you telling me to wait here alone?
-No, with me.

506
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:03,300
Why me? Ask Ji-hyang.

507
00:38:03,380 --> 00:38:05,100
No, he can't find out about this.

508
00:38:05,190 --> 00:38:08,050
What? I thought he knew everything.

509
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,070
He thinks I quit playing games.

510
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:12,180
I once skipped work for a game.

511
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:13,370
I see.

512
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:16,360
Then wait here alone.
The game company will be thrilled

513
00:38:16,450 --> 00:38:18,960
if you say you like this.
It'll be a huge hit.

514
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:22,350
-It's dangerous for me to sit alone.
-I'm in bigger danger now.

515
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,760
Didn't you read the comments?

516
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,280
This way, no one will know. Let's go.

517
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:31,060
How am I going to keep this on?
This is too suffocating.

518
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:45,800
Excuse us.

519
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:20,650
So we're just going to wait like this?

520
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:23,370
Why are you all lined up all night
just for some game?

521
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:26,190
You need to wait with a reverent heart.

522
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:32,040
I don't know about feeling reverent,

523
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:38,860
but can we wait with a full stomach?

524
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:42,340
You require lots of maintenance.

525
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:46,690
I'm starving, and my head is going numb.

526
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,600
Give me a moment.

527
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:55,360
My fellow brother.

528
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:57,390
Yes?

529
00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:59,850
I'm sorry, but can you keep our spots?

530
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,390
Sure, go ahead.

531
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,790
Do we leave this here?

532
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,190
Hello.

533
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:30,830
Gosh, that feels so much better.

534
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:36,460
Anyway, don't your fans know
that you love playing games?

535
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:39,100
They'll blow up if they find out.

536
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:43,230
Right, you only look cool on the outside.

537
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,990
Isn't it cool to play games?

538
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:47,720
It's because everything I do
becomes a trend.

539
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:50,050
The line is going to get longer
if they find out.

540
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,750
They need to see you
eating ramyeon like this.

541
00:40:58,500 --> 00:41:00,480
I can feel you glaring at me

542
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:02,240
even with your helmet on.

543
00:41:07,430 --> 00:41:09,590
That was good. I'm throwing this out.

544
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,190
Wait, I'm done too. Take mine too.

545
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:23,360
Oh no.

546
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,220
I'm sorry.

547
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:36,470
Why did you suddenly stand up?

548
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,230
I almost got burned.

549
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:42,630
Stop it. It wasn't that hot.
It already turned cold.

550
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:51,430
I would've sued you
if you poured it on my face.

551
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:53,980
I always wondered why people wore helmets,

552
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:56,490
but these are
so necessary in our daily life.

553
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:59,620
I can still smell it
no matter how much I wipe it off.

554
00:42:00,230 --> 00:42:01,680
I have to go home first.

555
00:42:02,170 --> 00:42:04,850
-What about me?
-I have to record a song tonight,

556
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:07,230
and it'll open soon,
so I'll pick you up afterward.

557
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,910
-Are you telling me to wait by myself?
-So why did you spill that?

558
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,640
That CD of the soundtrack is
the most important.

559
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:15,020
Make sure you get it.
Then take a picture and send it to me.

560
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:21,130
I was less embarrassed
because we were there together.

561
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:32,750
Did the helmet guy leave?

562
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:45,730
Excuse me. When will it open?

563
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:48,500
We have just five hours to go.

564
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:51,540
Five hours? What? He said it'll open soon.

565
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:52,720
Did I?

566
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:55,720
No, that helmet guy.

567
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:56,900
I see.

568
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:48,820
I'm sorry. I have to get this.

569
00:43:48,910 --> 00:43:50,540
Sure. Okay.

570
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:52,340
Hey, Hee-gun. What's up?

571
00:43:52,430 --> 00:43:54,590
Hey, it's about Lee Geun-young.

572
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:56,610
She took an interview with "Superpatch."

573
00:43:56,870 --> 00:43:59,730
You know, the paper that does
everything they can to stalk celebrities.

574
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:01,490
And? Did she make it?

575
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:03,030
(The thing is,)

576
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:06,550
I heard she was hired
in return for your information.

577
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,580
(I'll look into it more.)

578
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:11,390
Watch what you do around her for a while.

579
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:12,760
(You never know.)

580
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:15,530
Okay. Thanks.

581
00:44:20,190 --> 00:44:22,220
I'm sorry. Let's listen to it again.

582
00:44:22,310 --> 00:44:23,930
Okay, let's listen again.

583
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:38,760
We'll start handing out the soundtracks.
It's first-come-first-served.

584
00:44:38,850 --> 00:44:41,840
-Please line up.
-It's first-come-first-served.

585
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:43,160
-I'm tired.
-Let's hurry.

586
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:45,230
-But there's a line.
-Whatever.

587
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:47,080
-Just go.
-What are you doing?

588
00:44:47,830 --> 00:44:49,890
-Hey, stop!
-I was here first!

589
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:53,550
-Get back there!
-Stop pushing me!

590
00:44:54,120 --> 00:44:55,440
Stop it!

591
00:45:06,090 --> 00:45:07,760
(The thing is,)

592
00:45:07,850 --> 00:45:11,280
(I heard she was hired
in return for your information.)

593
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:21,970
(Just Geun-young)

594
00:46:04,870 --> 00:46:08,080
Why isn't he coming?
I left my wallet at home too.

595
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:14,110
Wait, is this
another one of their prank cams?

596
00:46:16,530 --> 00:46:19,920
Come on out now.
I won't fall for it anymore.

597
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,320
This isn't the first time.

598
00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:25,020
My gosh. If you're drunk,
get yourself home.

599
00:46:25,110 --> 00:46:27,220
Goodness, you seem impossible.

600
00:46:35,450 --> 00:46:36,990
My phone's dead too.

601
00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:39,890
He said he'll come back.

602
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,220
Let's go.

603
00:47:00,970 --> 00:47:02,420
What happened?

604
00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:05,190
If I didn't show up,
why didn't you think of taking a taxi?

605
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,610
I had to rush out,
so I left my wallet at home,

606
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,680
and my phone died.
How was I supposed to go home?

607
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:11,570
You're the one who didn't come back!

608
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:15,580
Do you know how tough it was to get
the poster and the CD in this helmet?

609
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:16,760
Just come.

610
00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:22,180
What? What's with him this time?

611
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:32,740
So?

612
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:35,600
Do you want me to take your stuff?

613
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:45,270
What's with him?

614
00:47:57,150 --> 00:47:58,250
Ji-hyang.

615
00:47:59,350 --> 00:48:02,430
You can tell Mr. Han
to do the shooting at the event today.

616
00:48:03,010 --> 00:48:06,660
And also tell him that the shooting
of "So I Married the Anti-Fan" ends today.

617
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:10,000
What do you mean?

618
00:48:10,090 --> 00:48:12,860
Please end it here. I'll talk to Mr. Bae.

619
00:48:24,130 --> 00:48:26,060
Quit what?

620
00:48:26,150 --> 00:48:27,730
What is this nonsense?

621
00:48:27,820 --> 00:48:32,180
Hey! Do you expect the agency
to take responsibility

622
00:48:32,270 --> 00:48:34,510
and let you quit shooting
that high-profile show?

623
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:37,810
Do you think I'm only here
to clean up after your mess?

624
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:39,530
Are you out of your mind or what?

625
00:48:39,610 --> 00:48:41,730
What did Ji-hyang say?
Did he say he'll let you quit?

626
00:48:41,810 --> 00:48:45,510
Do you think Ji-hyang works
to clean up your mess?

627
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:54,400
Geun-young!

628
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,820
-Hey.
-You're here.

629
00:48:57,170 --> 00:48:58,450
Where are we?

630
00:48:58,530 --> 00:49:01,220
It's an event for this clothing brand.
Who-joon will be here,

631
00:49:01,310 --> 00:49:04,300
and he wants to stand
at the photo wall with you.

632
00:49:04,390 --> 00:49:06,280
With me? At the photo wall?

633
00:49:06,370 --> 00:49:07,470
Yes.

634
00:49:08,170 --> 00:49:11,380
No, I can't do that.
Ms. No, you know my situation.

635
00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:13,320
Think of the time at the airport.

636
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:17,280
I can't be at a place
where there are lots of people.

637
00:49:17,370 --> 00:49:19,480
I understand how you feel,

638
00:49:19,570 --> 00:49:21,940
but we have to do the shoot.

639
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:25,110
I'm sorry, Geun-young.
Could you do this for us? Please?

640
00:49:25,510 --> 00:49:26,690
And...

641
00:49:28,410 --> 00:49:30,570
Never mind. Let's do the shooting first.

642
00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:32,500
Let's get ready, okay?

643
00:49:32,590 --> 00:49:34,390
Don't be so worried.

644
00:49:35,450 --> 00:49:36,550
Su-hwan!

645
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:39,940
I heard Ms. Lee will be here too.

646
00:49:40,030 --> 00:49:41,480
Don't run into her. Just go.

647
00:49:41,790 --> 00:49:44,210
Why? I have a misunderstanding to undo.

648
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:46,850
Please.
She won't be happy to see you anyway.

649
00:49:46,930 --> 00:49:50,940
Anyway, I heard
she was recruited somewhere.

650
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:53,660
-What do you mean?
-Everyone knows about the rumor.

651
00:49:53,750 --> 00:49:55,950
She got recruited
for handing over Who-joon's info.

652
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:58,240
Wait, did you tell Who-joon?

653
00:50:02,770 --> 00:50:05,020
-It's you again?
-My gosh.

654
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:06,340
Geun-young.

655
00:50:06,780 --> 00:50:08,400
Hey, we meet again.

656
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:12,850
But I'm right.
You interviewed with "Superpatch."

657
00:50:13,290 --> 00:50:16,100
I'm his go-to reporter,
so I had to report it to him.

658
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:21,210
Mr. Choi, you should quit your job
if you can't check the facts.

659
00:50:21,300 --> 00:50:24,070
Does Who-joon know
that his go-to reporter is like this?

660
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:30,580
-Hee-gun!
-Has she always been that short-tempered?

661
00:50:30,670 --> 00:50:33,310
Have you always been the guy
who speaks for a celebrity?

662
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:36,430
And did you check the facts on how
she handed over his info to get a job?

663
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:38,460
Hey, everyone knows about it.

664
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:40,300
Yes, but did you check the facts?

665
00:50:40,390 --> 00:50:42,370
You said it's true and everyone knows.

666
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:44,400
Then why haven't I heard as her friend?

667
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:48,180
Gosh.

668
00:50:57,460 --> 00:50:58,920
Don't you think this is too much?

669
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,860
-You look great, Geun-young.
-No, baby.

670
00:51:02,440 --> 00:51:05,470
You were an editor, so you know the best
and the worst style when you see it.

671
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:08,600
I can't bear to see what I put together
becoming the worst style.

672
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:14,010
Goodness, my baby. Your shoes don't fit.

673
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:16,520
My gosh, it must've hurt.

674
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:18,280
I'll get it.

675
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:24,790
Perfect.

676
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,940
I'll tell them that you're both ready.

677
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:38,820
Did you get home all right yesterday?

678
00:51:39,220 --> 00:51:41,200
I left the stuff at home...

679
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:45,820
(When he doesn't say anything,)

680
00:51:45,910 --> 00:51:47,490
(he's saying, "Shut up.")

681
00:51:47,580 --> 00:51:50,480
-By any chance, did you hear...
-Let's get going.

682
00:51:51,190 --> 00:51:52,290
Come on out.

683
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:57,700
-Look over here too.
-This way, please.

684
00:51:57,790 --> 00:51:59,150
Can you face forward?

685
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:06,980
-It's Who-joon!
-Who-joon!

686
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:09,800
Can you lift your hand?

687
00:52:09,890 --> 00:52:11,950
-Look in the middle.
-This way too, please.

688
00:52:12,040 --> 00:52:14,070
-Over here.
-Look over here too.

689
00:52:14,510 --> 00:52:15,910
This way too.

690
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:28,850
-What's going on?
-You might make it worse.

691
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:31,140
-That's too much.
-Joon.

692
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:34,260
Can you escort her?

693
00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:38,000
-You!
-Stop that!

694
00:52:48,210 --> 00:52:51,470
My gosh, I can't believe this.

695
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:53,840
What were the security guards doing?

696
00:52:53,930 --> 00:52:55,730
I'm sorry.
I should've been more concerned.

697
00:52:55,820 --> 00:52:58,810
Are you okay? No, how can you be?

698
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:01,630
-Geun-young, are you okay?
-Su-hwan.

699
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:04,890
This isn't good.
You should probably just leave now.

700
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:08,010
-Could you get me a taxi?
-I'll get it.

701
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:18,570
Geun-young, go home and get some rest.
I'll call you.

702
00:53:19,270 --> 00:53:21,870
Don't mind what Mr. Choi said.

703
00:53:22,970 --> 00:53:27,110
Anyway, Geun-young.
Today was our last shoot.

704
00:53:27,190 --> 00:53:30,100
Who-joon said
he doesn't want to do it anymore.

705
00:53:30,190 --> 00:53:31,290
Why not?

706
00:53:31,510 --> 00:53:33,490
How would we know
how a top star like him feels?

707
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:37,670
Anyhow, the show suddenly got canceled,
so we have a lot to patch up.

708
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:40,040
And these are your clothes

709
00:53:40,130 --> 00:53:42,240
and a bottle of wine I got from the event.

710
00:53:43,470 --> 00:53:45,590
I wanted to grab a drink with you
after tonight.

711
00:53:45,670 --> 00:53:47,960
Let's do that later. Get home safely.

712
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,420
-Joon.
-Hey. See you around.

713
00:54:30,550 --> 00:54:31,650
Okay.

714
00:54:31,830 --> 00:54:34,820
Joon, I took a huge blow.

715
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:38,520
It's Ms. Lee. "Superpatch" thought
they had a big deal sealed with her,

716
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:39,840
but they were turned down.

717
00:54:40,410 --> 00:54:43,580
It seems like she had a different side.

718
00:54:43,660 --> 00:54:45,820
She turned down
the editor-in-chief in his face.

719
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:49,160
Then you told me
without checking the facts?

720
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:51,010
Man, she must've been here for a shoot.

721
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:53,740
I feel bad for offending her.

722
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:14,020
For Lee Geun-young,
who hit her rock bottom.

723
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:16,220
Cheers.

724
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:18,780
Cheers.

725
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:21,020
Cheers.

726
00:55:22,690 --> 00:55:23,790
Cheers.

727
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:28,630
Goodbye.

728
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:43,590
(The door is locked.)

729
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,300
What are you doing alone?

730
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:58,900
You just barge in like this
without a call or ringing the bell.

731
00:55:58,990 --> 00:56:01,320
Well, the show is over,

732
00:56:01,410 --> 00:56:03,480
so the landlord gets to do
whatever he wants.

733
00:56:08,010 --> 00:56:09,290
Are you having a party alone?

734
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:10,830
A goodbye party with this house.

735
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:12,100
A goodbye party?

736
00:56:12,980 --> 00:56:14,570
I told you to stay here.

737
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:17,560
You aren't the only one with opinions.

738
00:56:18,310 --> 00:56:19,500
I got opinions too.

739
00:56:21,170 --> 00:56:22,660
You only do as you like.

740
00:56:24,600 --> 00:56:26,970
Didn't you get that wine at the event?

741
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:29,350
Then you should share.
You got it thanks to me.

742
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:32,390
And we're redoing your birthday party.

743
00:56:34,670 --> 00:56:35,770
Here.

744
00:56:36,610 --> 00:56:38,110
It's your real birthday present.

745
00:56:38,990 --> 00:56:40,660
Put them on and see if they fit.

746
00:56:45,630 --> 00:56:46,820
My birthday?

747
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:50,560
My birthday. Right.

748
00:56:51,350 --> 00:56:52,980
Gosh, my darned birthday.

749
00:56:53,070 --> 00:56:55,790
I'm never celebrating my birthday again.

750
00:56:56,450 --> 00:56:58,430
I'll forget everything.

751
00:56:59,090 --> 00:57:00,630
Why would you forget your birthday?

752
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:02,090
Life isn't easy,

753
00:57:02,170 --> 00:57:04,770
so it's a way of commending yourself
for holding out so well.

754
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:08,950
Why are you staring at me?
Put them on and see if they fit.

755
00:57:10,090 --> 00:57:11,330
My gosh.

756
00:57:14,710 --> 00:57:15,810
Give me your feet.

757
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:17,620
Why do you do this to me?

758
00:57:17,710 --> 00:57:20,170
You're really cranky, aren't you?

759
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:24,570
You've held out very well.

760
00:57:24,970 --> 00:57:28,000
It could've been
the worst situation for you.

761
00:57:29,630 --> 00:57:30,910
"The worst situation"?

762
00:57:31,830 --> 00:57:33,020
Is that a compliment?

763
00:57:33,810 --> 00:57:35,040
Should I be happy?

764
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:37,510
Why do you always
take my words the wrong way?

765
00:57:37,590 --> 00:57:39,570
What more do I have to take from this?

766
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:41,510
You're always like this.

767
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:46,350
How can people be like this?

768
00:57:46,790 --> 00:57:50,000
How can nobody try to think in my shoes?

769
00:57:50,090 --> 00:57:51,540
Have you...

770
00:57:51,890 --> 00:57:55,850
Have you thought about how much effort
it takes for me to be in all this?

771
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:58,410
Everyone toys around with me,

772
00:57:58,490 --> 00:58:01,130
criticizes me, and points fingers at me.

773
00:58:01,490 --> 00:58:04,260
But I can't even do anything.
You don't know...

774
00:58:04,350 --> 00:58:07,210
You don't know how it feels to be like
some gum people spat out, do you?

775
00:58:08,310 --> 00:58:09,850
But I still tried to endure.

776
00:58:09,930 --> 00:58:12,220
I still tried to hold it to the end.

777
00:58:12,310 --> 00:58:14,030
Mr. Han and Ms. No
would laugh and be nice,

778
00:58:14,110 --> 00:58:16,360
but they'd make a fool out of me
in an instant.

779
00:58:16,450 --> 00:58:18,340
Even then, I tried to understand.

780
00:58:18,430 --> 00:58:20,710
And you. You.

781
00:58:21,290 --> 00:58:23,490
You'd be nice to me one second,

782
00:58:23,570 --> 00:58:27,090
then you'd turn around
and completely ignore me.

783
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:29,210
But I still tried to understand.

784
00:58:31,580 --> 00:58:35,320
I did everything I can to be patient.
So how can you...

785
00:58:35,410 --> 00:58:38,580
Don't just say whatever you want
and get angry. Hear me out too.

786
00:58:39,460 --> 00:58:41,740
You make me concerned
by saying things like these!

787
00:58:41,830 --> 00:58:45,260
That's why I'm offering to move out
to help you get rid of your concerns.

788
00:58:45,350 --> 00:58:46,760
Then everything will be fine!

789
00:58:48,830 --> 00:58:49,930
I regret it too.

790
00:58:51,290 --> 00:58:52,570
I also regret

791
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:55,960
taking you there today,
bossing you around as I like,

792
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:59,170
and never saying sorry even though
I knew how much you were suffering.

793
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:02,290
You can now start living your life
without regrets.

794
00:59:02,470 --> 00:59:04,010
All you need is for me to get lost.

795
00:59:04,270 --> 00:59:07,000
I'm saying I'll move out
to stop regretting everything.

796
00:59:07,220 --> 00:59:09,240
Why do you make me so confused?

797
00:59:09,330 --> 00:59:11,140
Why do you get so fickle
and make me confused?

798
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:13,030
Just stay where I can see you.

799
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:20,200
I don't know why
I'm so concerned and confused about you,

800
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:22,620
so let's check tonight.

801
00:59:33,140 --> 00:59:34,240
(Do you have any idea)

802
00:59:35,730 --> 00:59:39,120
(how much maintenance you require
and how much you make me concerned?)

803
