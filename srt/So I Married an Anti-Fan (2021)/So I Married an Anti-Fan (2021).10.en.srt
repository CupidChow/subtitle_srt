I'm sorry.

I'm the type who doesn't think about
things that haven't happened yet.

00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:48,410
I didn't expect you would ask me this.

17
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:51,090
Is this how you're dodging this question?

18
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,000
You're very witty.

19
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,870
Then let's turn back
to the day you debuted.

20

This is when we should say
a star was born.

Do you remember your debut performance?

22

Why are you running away?

23
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,200
He's there smiling like everything's fine.

24
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,180
What are you so afraid of?

25
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,240
Do I seem insane to you too?

26
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:31,750
Should I have raised my hand
and said his first love is here?

27
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:34,430
Or just say that I'm the person

28
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,370
you wanted to run away from.

29
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:41,520
Why? Now that Joon seems to be
interested in another woman,

30
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,540
do you want to leave me?

31
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,520
-What?
-If you're done making me suffer,

32
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:47,940
it's time to let me go.

(Stage of Rejoice)

34
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,770
I get it, so stop looking at me.

35
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,960
Are you talking to me?

36
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:17,380
Great work today.

37
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,250
Who-joon's talk show was amazing.

38
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:24,280
Don't you think the question
about his first love will be a big issue?

39
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:29,040
But who is his first love?

40
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,760
-Aren't you curious?
-No.

41
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,380
Why are people so curious
about someone's past? I don't get it.

42
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:39,160
It's a type of prejudice.

43
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,590
It feels like Who-joon's first love
would be special.

44
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:47,340
Geun-young, have you read
"Pride and Prejudice"?

45
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:49,540
Why? Do you want me
to write a book report?

46
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:53,680
Come on.
Maybe you have a prejudice against me.

47
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,829
I've read it long ago,

48
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,500
and I recently gave it another look.

49
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:59,660
You should read it too.

50
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,460
I won't ask for a book report.

51
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:02,650
Great work today.

52
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:06,610
Thanks.

You're not an easy guy to crack.

63
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,380
If I was easy,

64
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,710
you wouldn't have cared so much about me.

65
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,140
-What's your relationship with her?
-That's enough.

66
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,650
I already made myself clear.

67
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:47,880
I meant Geun-young.

68
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:49,070
What?

69
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,890
We work together on a show. What else?

70
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:57,430
So you just work together?

71
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,250
Then you won't mind what I do with her.

72
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,970
Why do I always want to take
everything from you?

73
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,520
Bye, then.

Geun-young.

75
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:25,550
Hey.

76
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:29,600
I probably shouldn't have said I'd stay.

77
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,710
I made that really awkward.

78
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:33,730
Anyway,

79
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:37,820
do you think it's very troubling
to ask someone about their first love?

80
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,760
Do you think so too?

81
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:43,190
People talk as if
we should forgive everything

82
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,680
Or should we be doing that?

83
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,830
(It's not because you forgive them.)

84
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,810
(It's because they're your first love.)

-Hey!

00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,250
What's wrong?
Did you leave something behind?

88
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,410
What? No. It's nothing.

89
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,770
Why do I always want to take
everything from you?

My gosh.

91
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:34,320
Why are you here alone?

92
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,520
Oh, right.

93
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:38,540
Did you forget to ask him?

94
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:42,720
See? Adults never keep their promises,
then expect us to trust people.

95
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:45,800
Figures, I shouldn't have trusted you.

96
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:49,280
Why would he do anything
that some anti-fan asks?

97
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,040
Hey.

98
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:54,430
Do I owe him to you or what?

99
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:57,240
Why does everyone around Who-joon think
I'm a big joke?

100
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:59,440
I hope someone would leave me
in the lost and found bin

101
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:00,670
so that no one can find me!

102
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:01,990
Move!

103
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:08,680
Geun-young, is something going on?

104
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:15,630
Why? Now that Joon seems to be
interested in another woman,

105
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:17,880
do you want to leave me?

106
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:42,870
What are you looking at?

107
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:46,040
Jae-joon, there's a new trainee.

108
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:49,340
It's not that you're great at dancing,
but you have a good sense of rhythm.

109
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:51,010
You'll catch up quickly.

110
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,160
He's good-looking.

111
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:01,390
Right?

112
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:17,280
(I met you first)

113
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:20,890
(and I liked you first too.)

114
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,590
You were

115
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,890
my first love as well.

116
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:55,470
It's not like she did anything wrong.

117
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,360
I shouldn't have been angry at her.

118
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,460
(The person you have reached
is not available. Please leave...)

119
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,870
He must be busy.

120
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,060
I should've asked him before.

121
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:22,480
It's all because of that question
about his first love.

122
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:28,030
What if your first love
comes back to find you now?

123
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,100
Wait.

124
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:38,100
So what if his first love returns?

125
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:40,390
Why didn't he answer...

126
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,040
That's also none of my business.

127
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:46,380
My gosh, I'm going crazy.

128
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,640
You can't be here.

129
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,790
What are you talking about?
This is my house.

130
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,460
I should've told you before.

131
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:10,750
One of your fans is here right now.

132
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,510
She knew I was here
and waited or whatever.

133
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,400
So I tried to send her back home,

134
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:16,250
but she lives in Gimje of all places,

135
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:19,240
-so I...
-What are you talking about? Hey, breathe.

136
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,370
So what will you do about this situation?

137
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,350
You should wait at home,
and ask Ji-hyang...

138
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,540
My gosh.

139
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,030
Geun-young, you talked to him!

140
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,150
This is a dream.

141
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,970
Yes, it is.
Go back to sleep, it's a dream.

142
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,640
Go on, then. Bye.

143
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,070
What's going on?

144
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,480
So

145
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,000
you watched the TV show
and found this place?

146
00:11:05,090 --> 00:11:08,480
Yes, it's not a big deal.

147
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:12,260
I should go dig up the ground
or live in a cave.

148
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:14,950
No, I never told anyone about this place.

149
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,440
And never will.

150
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:19,350
I'm a huge fan of yours.

151
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,280
A genuine, real, and hard-core fan.

152
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:24,540
What the heck is
a genuine, real, and hard-core fan?

153
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:32,680
You asked me to marry you

154
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,750
when I grow up.

155
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:35,930
What?

156
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:40,420
I always hated how celebrities make
all these absurd pledges

157
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:41,790
they can never keep.

158
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:43,590
What are you saying? I never said that.

159
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,350
You said that to me.

160
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:48,780
I went to Dongdaemun with my mom
when I was a kid,

161
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,850
and when you finished performing,

162
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,830
you said that as you gave me an autograph.

163
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,990
-I never said that to her.
-Look.

164
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,380
-What is this?
-Goodness.

165
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:02,770
(Marry me when you get older!)
-What is this?
-Goodness.

166
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:03,300
(Marry me when you get older!)

167
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:03,570
You asked her to marry you.
(Marry me when you get older!)

168
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:04,840
You asked her to marry you.

169
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:07,310
You should live up to your promise. Gosh.

170
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:12,540
I never washed it and kept it that way.

171
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:15,890
Then I formed a fan club right away
as soon as you made your debut.

172
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:19,320
I'm your fan club president
of the North Jeolla District.

173
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,690
Oh, the president
of the North Jeolla District.

174
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,110
Then Ms. President,

175
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,470
you must understand that
this is very troubling for me.

176
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,390
Well, you know.

177
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,940
I'm a huge fan of yours.

178
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,330
I don't spread rumors
that can get you in trouble.

179
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:42,550
Okay, now. He's very troubled,
so you should go home now.

180
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:46,550
I'm sure your dad left your name
in the lost and found as a joke.

181
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,150
The lost and found? What is that?

182
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,480
Her dad is the stationmaster
at Gimje Station,

183
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,330
and he registered her name there

184
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,050
because she ran away from home.

185
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:57,070
You ran away from home?

186
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,090
Why would you tell him that?

187
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,770
You're the president of a district,

188
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:03,760
so I figured
he should know what your situation is.

189
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,440
If you ran from home, you should go back.

190
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:07,810
Why would you be here?

191
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,510
Are you sure this will be okay?

192
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:22,940
She found this place on her own.
She isn't an ordinary kid.

193
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,390
Are you worried about me?

194
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,580
No.

195
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:27,610
About Ms. President.

196
00:13:27,690 --> 00:13:30,420
An anti-fan like you
might end up rubbing off

197
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,830
on an avid fan like her.

198
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,530
Don't worry.
We're from two different bloodlines.

199
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,560
You just told me not to worry,

200
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:40,100
so I'll forget how you got pouty.

201
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:44,060
Whatever. I never pouted.

202
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,410
Why is he here this early?

203
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:09,160
Hey, get ready. We're going out.

204
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,920
-Yu-ri?
-Yes?

205
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:13,070
Good morning.

206
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,180
Yes, good morning. Get ready to go out.

207
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:16,550
Where are we going?

208
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:20,380
What? Oh, we're all going for a drive.

209
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,660
It's 8 a.m. right now.

210
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:25,000
Is time more important than me?

211
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,490
No.

212
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,180
Yu-ri, bring your backpack too.

213
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,980
I need that for the drive?

214
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:33,840
You're a student,
so you'll look great with a backpack.

215
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:36,040
-Go on and get it.
-Okay.

216
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,000
What are you doing? Get ready.

217
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:45,320
It's eight right now,

218
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:48,360
so we'll be there by 11:30 a.m.

219
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,640
Right. You drive.

220
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:03,320
You saw me behind the wheel.

221
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:05,300
Exactly. That's why you should drive.

222
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:06,710
Practice makes perfect.

223
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,260
Wait, are you just tired?

224
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:11,770
Then do I get to sit in the back with you?

225
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,620
You can do it!

226
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:30,780
Anyway, are we not going to eat anything?

227
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,110
We haven't had breakfast.

228
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,790
Yu-ri, be quiet. I have to focus.

229
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,730
She was really weird last night,

230
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,710
so I couldn't ask her for dinner either.

231
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,560
Really?

232
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:45,740
Okay, then. Let's eat something.
I'm hungry.

233
00:16:45,910 --> 00:16:47,500
Let's stop by at a rest area.

234
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:49,040
I want potatoes, lots of sugar.

235
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,710
I want a corn dog, lots of ketchup.

236
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,940
So they're asking me to get it.

237
00:16:58,190 --> 00:16:59,460
-One corn dog, please.
-Okay.

238
00:16:59,550 --> 00:17:01,270
We have ketchup and mustard over there.

239
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,940
Or you can use sugar.

240
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,790
Ketchup is fine.

241
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:05,540
(Rest Area)

242
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:09,319
Who-joon, did you do something bad to her?
(Rest Area)

243
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:13,319
Why? Does it look like I did something?

244
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:17,550
She didn't seem like a real anti-fan.

245
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:21,109
She didn't seem like
she'd hate someone for no reason.

246
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:24,630
Why? Did you decide to switch sides

247
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,790
after spending a few days with her?

248
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:28,630
No way.

249
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:31,540
How can I put this?

250
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:35,980
She seemed like someone who's
waiting to be found at the lost and found.

251
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:37,920
But then yesterday,

252
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:41,220
she said she wants to be a lost article
that no one would come back for.

253
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:45,220
-She said that?
-Yes. That makes no sense.

254
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:47,730
All lost things want to be found.

255
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:54,640
(Rest Area)

256
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:57,670
Okay. You can each grab your food.

257
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,360
Hey, forget it. I'll drive. Let's switch.

258
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:01,680
All of a sudden?

259
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:08,760
Why?

260
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,200
Wow, they all recognized me
in that short while.

261
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:17,960
-That could've been bad.
-No one is around.

262
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:20,200
-Why? Everyone was looking.
-They're all staring.

263
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:21,920
-Right, Yu-ri? They all looked.
-All the dashcams too.

264
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:22,360
(Rest Area)
-Right, Yu-ri? They all looked.
-All the dashcams too.

265
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:22,450
(Rest Area)

266
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:24,560
I almost got caught just now.
(Rest Area)

267
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:24,650
(Rest Area)

268
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:25,970
-My gosh.
-What?
(Rest Area)

269
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:28,340
-That could've been bad.
-No one was looking.

270
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,710
She ate so quickly, then fell asleep.

271
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:37,490
You look after her like she's your sister
after spending a few days together.

272
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,390
What? A sister?

273
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:44,140
She's an avid fan, I'm an anti-fan.
We're completely different.

274
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,020
(Gimje)

275
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:55,230
You came out to come here?

276
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,900
Yes.

277
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,150
What? This is...

278
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:05,650
Who-joon, are you going to my home?

279
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:06,840
What?

280
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:10,320
You're right.
You might as well go home, then.

281
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:12,830
I'm not going home.

282
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:15,420
Then will you live your life
as a lost article?

283
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:17,400
I've been abandoned anyway.

284
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,310
You said all lost articles

285
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,640
want to be found.

286
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:31,530
(Gimje Station)

287
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:36,760
It may not seem like
your parents care about you,

288
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:38,650
but it means they trust you.

289
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,680
She's not going to listen.

290
00:19:40,770 --> 00:19:44,020
Exactly. You're great, Who-joon.

291
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,370
Give me your phone.

292
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:49,430
Why? Are you going to call my parents?

293
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,710
Give it to me now.

294
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,890
Once you go home today,
don't ever run away again.

295
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,300
This is my number.

296
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,370
Come and see me once you go to college.

297
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:04,390
Don't turn me down when the day comes.

298
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:07,390
And if you leak my phone number out,

299
00:20:07,470 --> 00:20:09,540
our relationship ends as of today. Okay?

300
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:12,400
No, I'll never do that.

301
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:16,010
Thank you for everything, Geun-young.

302
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:22,960
Bye.

303
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:27,320
Make sure you see your dad
write "found" on the lost and found sheet.

304
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,870
I'll kill you if you hit on Who-joon.

305
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,920
Hey! That's never going to happen.

306
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,310
Why? What did she say?

307
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,890
Not telling.

308
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:51,120
(Gimje Station)

309
00:20:57,060 --> 00:21:00,400
Anyway, where's your parent's home?

310
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,340
Why do you ask?

311
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,510
I can already tell
that you weren't born in Seoul.

312
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:06,870
So where is it?

313
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:10,390
Are you looking down on people
who were born out of Seoul?

314
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,080
There's this place called Dangjin.
Have you heard of it?

315
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,260
No, I haven't.

316
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,920
You're from the U.S. You wouldn't know.

317
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,540
It's a place called Dangjin.

318
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,660
I'm tired from driving so early.

319
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:27,510
Wake me up when we get to Seoul.

320
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,810
You didn't even drive for an hour.

321
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,540
Where are your manners?

322
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:59,410
I think we're in Dangjin now.

323
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,950
I'm so hungry.

324
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,370
Hey, Geun-young, wake up.

325
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,640
Geun-young.

326
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:06,540
My gosh.

327
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,840
Are we in Seoul already?

328
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:11,950
Where's your home?

329
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,260
You know where I live.
Just drop me off at the entrance.

330
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,030
No, your home in Dangjin.

331
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,230
Dangjin?

332
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:23,610
(Dangjin)

333
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,950
Where are we?

334
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,400
Dangjin, what do you think?

335
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:32,800
Why... Why did you come to Dangjin?
Are we going to my parent's home?

336
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,370
Stop the car here. I'll drive.

337
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:38,040
Let's go back into the highway.

338
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:39,890
But we're already here.

339
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:42,000
I drove for over an hour.

340
00:22:42,090 --> 00:22:44,550
If we turn back now,
it means you're a bad daughter.

341
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,190
I'm sure your mother is worried.
Go show her you're doing well

342
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,080
by making a joke out of a star.

343
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:51,770
Why would you suddenly come here?

344
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,550
No, if we go there now,
my parents will get furious.

345
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,870
Who's going to deal with that?

346
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,780
Why do you always say no
whenever I try to do something

347
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:01,050
for you?

348
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,990
Let's go back to Seoul now.

349
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,310
This is disappointing.

350
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:10,910
Let's see.

351
00:23:11,170 --> 00:23:13,110
Under the moonlight.

352
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:17,330
Expect guests under the moonlight?

353
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:21,070
Goodness.
Is someone about to make a visit?

354
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:36,730
Is this it?

355
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,250
-Why are you so secretive?
-No, wait.

356
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:44,960
Be quiet.

357
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,150
Who's there?

358
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:49,190
You. You brat.

359
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:52,350
-Come here.
-Mom, wait. Mom, I'm sorry.

360
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,960
I can't believe everything you did
to break our hearts.

361
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:58,380
-Mom, please!
-Whoa, please stop.

362
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:01,860
Who's this? Why is this man
holding my kid in his arms?

363
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:03,490
-You little jerk.
-Goodness.

364
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:05,160
Come on, Mom!

365
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:08,550
Hello, ma'am. You know me, right?
I'm Who-joon.

366
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:09,730
What is this?

367
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:12,680
He's the guy
who put you in trouble, right?

368
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:20,690
So he's that famous guy?

369
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:26,890
I'm sorry for making you worried.

370
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:34,070
Ms. Jang, we came in a hurry,
so this isn't much.

371
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:36,880
I'll send you something better
once we get to Seoul.

372
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:46,120
Do I have something on me?

373
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,390
You'll wear his face down
from staring at him.

374
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:54,700
I can't tell why you're so popular
by the way you look.

375
00:25:01,390 --> 00:25:02,490
She's so straightforward.

376
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,700
Does it hurt a lot?

377
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:09,440
I guess she really hates me.

378
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:11,910
Did you see how she beat me in full swing?

379
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,070
I thought she was on a baseball team.

380
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:19,340
Anyway, she really doesn't know who I am?

381
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:23,040
Just because you're the national star,
did you really think everyone knows you?

382
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:24,270
It doesn't make any sense.

383
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:27,390
I was the most popular
on a survey taken by people in their 50s.

384
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:31,620
Wow, it's not easy to be like this guy.

385
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,740
You made a lot.

386
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,820
Are you giving him more food out of spite?

387
00:25:48,910 --> 00:25:51,290
No, I just didn't know what he liked.

388
00:25:51,370 --> 00:25:53,750
But no one in this world hates tteokbokki.

389
00:25:54,670 --> 00:25:58,940
When I was younger,
my mother ran a tteokbokki place.

390
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:02,200
Her business
heroically went under with the review,

391
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,910
"It's tough for tteokbokki
to be this bad."

392
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,730
Is this the famous...

393
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:10,120
Yes, the famous tteokbokki
in downtown Dangjin.

394
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:14,210
Right? Everyone loves tteokbokki, right?

395
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,970
Yes, of course.

396
00:26:16,060 --> 00:26:20,590
Oddly, Geun-young is the only girl I know
who doesn't like tteokbokki.

397
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:24,060
Don't worry. He loves it.
I'm sure he'll finish everything.

398
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:27,100
I see, I'm glad.

399
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:31,410
Look. The color already looks appetizing.

400
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:36,650
I really have no idea
why my tteokbokki place went under.

401
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:39,240
Try a bite first,

402
00:26:39,330 --> 00:26:41,400
then give me your objective opinion.

403
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:43,250
Okay.

404
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:46,990
What? Right.

405
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,200
It's really good.

406
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:11,850
My gosh, you're more frank than you look.

407
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:16,730
Geun-young, you should eat up,
then go fetch your dad

408
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:19,150
before he buys something weird again.

409
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:22,190
At this rate, he might come home
with stars and the Moon.

410
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:24,740
He already bought stars and the Moon.

411
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,100
What?

412
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:29,450
Well, let me put this in a good way.

413
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:32,530
When you go to the Moon later,
you'll have a piece of land for yourself.

414
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,340
I can't believe this guy.

415
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:37,370
-Eat up.
-Yes, Ma'am.

416
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:42,160
This is spicy and sweet. What a meal.

417
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,800
Mom, make him some more.
That's hardly enough.

418
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:46,920
-Should I really?
-Yes, he loves tteokbokki.

419
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,280
I see.

420
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:53,740
I can't remember the last time
I had such a nice stroll.

421
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:59,900
Tell me about it. I always ran around
in a hurry ever since I met you.

422
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:03,370
That's because you always went around
causing trouble.

423
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:07,550
I never caused any trouble.
You're the one who gets weird ideas.

424
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:10,760
Weird ideas? Wait.

425
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:13,270
If this is about that day,
it's a misunderstanding.

426
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:16,700
It's okay.
I already forgot all about it too.

427
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,180
What are you doing? Are you going to run?

428
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:27,970
No, there are no people around,
so I thought we should walk a little.

429
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,510
Have you gone insane?

430
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:32,240
It'll start a rumor.
That's what it's like in the countryside.

431
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:36,150
Wait for me. Then can I do this?

432
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:38,790
Hey, what are you doing?

433
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,420
-Why?
-Come on.

434
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:44,600
(Jeongsan 3-ri Community Hall)

435
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,670
They won't buy the product
at a reasonable price,
(Jeongsan 3-ri Community Hall)

436
00:28:46,670 --> 00:28:46,760
(Jeongsan 3-ri Community Hall)

437
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,690
so my year's hard work
almost came to nothing.
(Jeongsan 3-ri Community Hall)

438
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:50,360
so my year's hard work
almost came to nothing.

439
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:53,490
-Exactly.
-It's really frustrating. What about you?

440
00:28:53,570 --> 00:28:54,890
It's the same for me.

441
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:55,860
(Jeongsan 3-ri Community Hall)
It's the same for me.

442
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:55,950
(Jeongsan 3-ri Community Hall)

443
00:28:55,950 --> 00:28:57,710
You should run
for the village foremanship next year.
(Jeongsan 3-ri Community Hall)

444
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:00,220
You should run
for the village foremanship next year.

445
00:29:00,310 --> 00:29:02,290
-Me? Come on.
-Dad.

446
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:05,150
Hello, sir.

447
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:06,730
-Geun-young, you're here.
-Hey.

448
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:09,810
Wait, is that Geun-young's boyfriend?

449
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:12,270
-No, he's not.
-Hello.

450
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:16,940
Wait, he's that jerk on TV
who deserves to be beaten to death.

451
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:19,400
Yes, that's me. Hello, Mr. Lee.

452
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:21,870
I'll kill you today and kill myself.

453
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:24,640
-Wait, Dad! Dad!
-Hey, stop!

454
00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:26,180
-What's with you?
-Dad!

455
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:28,820
-Stop that!
-Please calm down!

456
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:32,070
Calm down? My blood pressure
went off the charts because of him.

457
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:33,530
I can't calm down.

458
00:29:33,610 --> 00:29:36,870
-My gosh, Lee. What's with you?
-Let him go!

459
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,510
What are you two doing?
Get away from each other!

460
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:40,740
Okay, fine.

461
00:29:40,830 --> 00:29:43,340
Geun-young. Geun-young, one second.

462
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:46,860
-My gosh.
-You darned jerk.

463
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:49,980
-Hey, Lee. Stop that.
-Why are you so harsh?

464
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:50,110
(Jeongsan 3-ri Community Hall)
-Hey, Lee. Stop that.
-Why are you so harsh?

465
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:50,200
(Jeongsan 3-ri Community Hall)

466
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,790
-Calm down.
-Goodness.
(Jeongsan 3-ri Community Hall)

(Jeongsan 3-ri Community Hall)

468
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:54,730
And this young man.
He's that young man who's on TV.
(Jeongsan 3-ri Community Hall)

And this young man.
He's that young man who's on TV.

470
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:57,240
Yes, that's me. Feel free to stare at me.

471
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:59,130
Yes, it's you.

472
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:01,860
You're much more good-looking in person.

473
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:03,310
-Thank you.
-My gosh.

474
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:07,980
Goodness, how did you
end up coming to our town?

475
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:09,520
-I just came with her.
-Are you okay?

476
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:11,060
Okay, fine.

477
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:14,670
-My gosh.
-Goodness, Lee! Stop!

478

-Dad!
-Darn you!

00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:18,490
-Are you okay?
-Of course. That was a lashing of love.

480
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,210
-Grab a drink.
-Of course, sir.

481
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,980
I heard you're very famous.

482
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:27,510
-You're a top star or something.
-He's a singer.

483
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:33,280
Right. Let me pour you a glass, sir.

484
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:34,470
Sounds great.

485
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:37,680
Dad, let him pour you one.

486
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:41,240
When will you get to let a singer
pour you a drink?

487
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:51,010
If you ever make Geun-young cry,

488
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,300
I'll pluck your eyes out.

489
00:30:56,030 --> 00:30:57,260
Yes, I'll remember that.

490
00:30:57,350 --> 00:31:02,010
Anyway, why does Geun-young
look so bad on TV?

491
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:02,980
Right.

492
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:05,090
She's very polite,

493
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:07,290
and she does a great job
when she runs errands.

494
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:09,490
She was the most wanted daughter-in-law

495
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:12,260
in our village up until she turned 25.

496
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:13,540
Yes, you're right.

497
00:31:13,630 --> 00:31:15,960
Only up until she was 25.

498
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,250
What? Then I'm not most wanted anymore?

499
00:31:18,330 --> 00:31:19,830
No, that's not what I meant.

500
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:23,700
Geun-young may be suffering
from people's criticism now,

501
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:26,430
but I know one day,
she'll get the credit she deserves.

502
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,930
We're going to wait.

503
00:31:28,010 --> 00:31:31,670
Geun-young isn't a girl
who lets people down.

504
00:31:31,750 --> 00:31:34,310
I'm feeling much better now that I'm here.
Let me pour you one.

505
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:36,200
All right, sure.

506
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:39,320
This is great.

507
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:40,510
You should take one too.

508
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:46,890
I can still see lots of stars here.

509
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:50,580
You know that one of those stars is mine.

510
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,270
You have one too.

511
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:54,940
Really? Mine too?

512
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:59,870
Yes, the small, bright star over there.

513
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:01,060
That's yours.

514
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:06,030
You're easily persuaded,
but you're also pretty romantic.

515
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:10,430
But stop buying things.
Mom is getting stressed out.

516
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,620
I know.

517
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:15,400
She'll get furious
if she finds out that I bought stars.

518
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:17,730
So this is a secret from her, okay?

519
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:22,440
Dad, I told her by mistake.

520
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:23,720
What?

521
00:32:24,730 --> 00:32:27,590
Goodness, should I sell it off again?

522
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:30,140
-You.
-Yes, sir.

523
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:32,520
-Carry me on your back.
-Sorry?

524
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,890
Carry me on your back. Come here.

525
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:39,640
Tell Mom that I got very drunk.

526
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:41,580
-Go.
-Yes, sir.

527
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,350
A top star's back isn't very different.

528
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,540
Right.

529
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:48,090
How far can you go with me on your back?

530
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:51,570
You won't go down
even before you go 100 meters, will you?

531
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:55,130
No, that won't happen.
I can go very far, Mr. Lee.

532
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:59,490
Mr. Very Far, why are you trembling?

533
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:05,910
(Well, it looks a lot like the room
I have in Seoul, right?)

534
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:09,040
You wanted to come, so don't blame me.

535
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:15,810
You've had guests here before, right?

536
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:19,020
I can hear weird wind sounds
from the plumbing.

537
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:22,100
You have a face mask, right? Put it on.

538
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:26,240
You're worried about my bronchial tubes?

539
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:28,000
I'm awfully grateful.

540
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,900
Goodnight. I hope you make it.

541
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:34,730
Right, I think Mom said
she saw some rats in the drain.

542
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:37,280
Did she catch them? Or was it a snake?

543
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:40,450
What? Hey, Geun-young. Geun-young!

544
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:53,830
Rats?

545
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:40,510
It must be uncomfortable
trying to sleep on the floor.

546
00:34:41,570 --> 00:34:43,190
Hey, you weren't asleep.

547
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:50,590
I didn't know we could still see
a night sky like this in Korea.

548
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,020
You're very sentimental.

549
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:58,730
By any chance, have ever been to Alaska?

550
00:34:58,810 --> 00:35:01,890
I haven't even been to Japan.
Do you actually think I've been there?

551
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:03,520
Right.

552
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:08,360
You've heard of the name Benny, right?

553
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:11,530
Well, you've done
your share of research on me.

554
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:13,200
My real name is Benny.

555
00:35:13,470 --> 00:35:15,050
I came from Alaska.

556
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:17,780
Oh, Alaska?

557
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:20,240
I didn't know that.

558
00:35:20,330 --> 00:35:25,790
People think I'm an international student
who studied in the U.S.,

559
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:27,990
but after I graduated high school,

560
00:35:28,070 --> 00:35:31,150
I left my single mother alone
and decided to come to Korea.

561
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:33,710
And now that I see
such a wonderful night sky,

562
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:35,820
I'm reminded of Alaska.

563
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:38,990
Do you miss her?

564
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:46,990
So you should come
and see your parents more often.

565
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,930
They must be lonely by themselves.

566
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,630
You suddenly talk
like you're such an elder.

567
00:35:53,330 --> 00:35:54,830
I'm a year older than you.

568
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:57,290
What? You're the same age as me.

569
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:01,380
What? You lied about your age too?

570
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:04,810
Why do you have so many secrets?
What's true about you?

571
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:08,200
It's not like I wanted to lie about it.

572
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:11,240
At times,

573
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:14,050
I also get confused about who I am.

574
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,990
(These are his memories and love.)

575
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:23,430
(But why does this make my heart ache?)

576
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,140
(Who do I think I am?)

577
00:36:27,470 --> 00:36:30,250
-My gosh! Goodness.
-My gosh.

578
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:32,090
What was that? A snake?

579
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:36,490
Where? Where is it?

580
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:37,680
Over there.

581
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,590
I knew I'd see a snake here.

582
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:42,390
This is bad. Come here.

583
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:45,950
Why are you sitting so close to me?

584
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:49,170
Is this one of your jokes again?

585
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:52,330
Am I a guy
who always jokes around with you?

586
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:56,250
If it's not a joke,

587
00:36:57,700 --> 00:36:59,290
why do you keep doing this to me?

588
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:04,650
Well, I don't know when it began,

589
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:07,070
but I like you.

590
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:06,340
Geun-young, aren't you going to get up?
You must've been tired.

591
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:12,280
Goodness.

592
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:15,180
It's so great to sleep at home.

593
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:17,820
So? Did you get to bed early last night?

594
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,690
Yes, I fell asleep right away.

595
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:27,420
So where is he?

596
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,140
He's sweeping the yard.
It's a perfect job for him.

597
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:32,170
What? Sweeping the yard?

598
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,040
Why did you make him sweep the yard?

599
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,590
You're all very odd.

600
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,010
Plato is a perfect read for the morning.

601
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,020
You're finally up.

602
00:38:56,850 --> 00:38:58,260
That's my dad's jacket.

603
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:02,480
Oh, Ms. Jang let me borrow it
because it got colder.

604
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:06,310
Anyway, don't you think
she's discriminative?

605
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,940
She makes the guest wake up early,

606
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:10,450
but left her daughter to sleep in.

607
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,250
I like how consistent she is.

608
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:13,530
You didn't have to do it.

609
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:15,550
You never do what you don't want to do.

610
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,020
She said she won't let me eat
if I don't do this.

611
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:21,490
It's cold. Go back inside.

612
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:32,320
What is this?
Is today a holiday? Is this a party?

613
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,160
You never make these for me.

614
00:39:34,250 --> 00:39:37,860
A guy should eat this much
and be stronger.

615
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:40,460
-No one eats this much these days.
-Should I take some off?

616
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:43,360
No, ma'am. Thank you.

617
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,280
Right.

618
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:53,660
You should eat first, Father.

619
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,150
Why am I your father?

620
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,340
Then how should I address you?

621
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:03,200
I thought it'd be impolite
to call you Mr. Lee.

622
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:07,820
I think he's right.
Father sounds better than Mr. Lee.

623
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:10,420
-Eat up.
-Don't address me. Just don't.

624
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:13,900
All right, now. Let's eat.

625
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:19,660
-Here.
-Thank you.

626
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,290
Let's see.

627
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:27,090
Eat the green onion.

628
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:30,660
-The crab shell.
-Right.

629
00:40:30,750 --> 00:40:32,290
Father gave me some green onion.

630
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:34,090
-Green onion and chicken.
-Goodness.

631
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:36,290
-He's so witty.
-That's good.

632
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:40,120
I keep calling In-hyung,

633
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:43,460
but she won't pick up.

634
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,670
You said she isn't home either.

635
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,260
I'm sorry.

636
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:51,430
You're her manager,
yet you don't know where she is?

637
00:40:52,090 --> 00:40:55,870
Go look everywhere
and see if you can find her.

638
00:40:56,350 --> 00:40:57,450
Yes, sir.

639
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:03,750
Darn it.

640
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,110
How did I do?

641
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:06,610
Great.

642
00:41:08,890 --> 00:41:09,990
(Jae-joon)

643
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,900
(Jae-joon)

644
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,640
They didn't think it was bad.

645
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:19,280
Then may I listen again?

646
00:41:19,370 --> 00:41:20,470
Sure.

647
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,160
I need to take this call.

648
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:34,900
(Who-joon's single)

649
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:40,930
(Who-joon's single)

650
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:54,040
Make sure you eat well.

651
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:57,820
I packed some sesame oil too,
so don't let it leak.

652
00:41:57,910 --> 00:41:59,140
You didn't have to.

653
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:02,220
If you want some, take hers.
I packed enough for two.

654
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:07,060
Wait, aren't people on TV
too picky to eat something like this?

655
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:09,610
No way, I love it.

656
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:11,730
Especially your tteokbokki.

657
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,320
I only let you off
because you aren't my kid.

658
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:18,110
Don't you ever let my daughter
get involved in something unfair.

659
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:20,530
-All right.
-Okay.

660
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:23,910
If you be good to her,
I might make something for you again.

661
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:29,590
If you get my daughter in trouble,
I'll break the antenna off the TV station,

662
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,970
as well as your two legs.

663
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:34,250
I'll remember that, Father.

664
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:48,200
Thank you, Father.
I'll come back for more tteokbokki.

665
00:42:48,290 --> 00:42:50,530
-Who says you can?
-Me.

666
00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:02,190
Your mother is such a loving woman.
I still feel full.

667
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:05,760
It's not that she's loving.

668
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:09,540
I think she fed you a lot
to avenge me since you were so mean.

669
00:43:09,630 --> 00:43:13,150
No way. You don't give someone
that much fish fillet and meat

670
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,650
for someone you hate.

671
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:17,770
In the end, she fell for me too.

672
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:20,140
I'm starting to get jealous of you.

673
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:23,000
How can you be so confident?

674
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:26,260
You should have some of that confidence.
You deserve to.

675
00:43:26,350 --> 00:43:29,820
People in your village have
a high level of trust in you.

676
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:33,260
I was afraid you were an outcast
even at here,

677
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:36,510
but I was the mean one. I got scared.
It's a whole village of anti-fans.

678
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:41,920
Why is the car slowing down?

679
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:44,610
-Are we out of gas?
-No way. One second.

680
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:46,240
We need to call for help.

681
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,610
Wait, I can't.

682
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:00,540
Can you move your feet?

683
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,450
I know the button is
somewhere around here.

684
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:12,020
-Is it over here?
-Should I get off?

685
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:13,650
No, you can stay.

686
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,330
I think it was somewhere back here.

687
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:18,620
-That one?
-Is that it?

688
00:44:18,970 --> 00:44:20,860
Can you move your hand?

689
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:25,130
It was somewhere around here.

690
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,330
Somewhere around here.

691
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:31,820
Why?

692
00:44:31,950 --> 00:44:34,280
-You did that on purpose.
-I saw the button here somewhere.

693
00:44:34,370 --> 00:44:37,450
-I need to take another look.
-You're really sly.

694
00:44:39,830 --> 00:44:41,150
My gosh.

695
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:44,450
Yes, I'm on the highway now.

696
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:46,560
So where exactly are you?

697
00:44:46,910 --> 00:44:48,890
So you were out of gas.

698
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:51,440
You weren't looking for anything.

699
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:54,480
Things could've got worse
if something else was wrong.

700
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:56,900
Wait, isn't this situation

701
00:44:56,990 --> 00:44:59,540
the same as the mistake
Ji-hyang made long ago?

702
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:00,730
That one?

703
00:45:01,650 --> 00:45:03,540
He told you about that?

704
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:05,520
That was unnecessary.

705
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:08,520
Why? After he told me that,

706
00:45:10,890 --> 00:45:15,470
I thought you were
a better person than I thought.

707
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:24,400
So you went and gave that fan a ride?

708
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:27,480
You should've told me.

709
00:45:27,790 --> 00:45:30,120
You know, I was being nice to a fan.

710
00:45:30,210 --> 00:45:33,860
Goodness, what a nice celebrity you are.

711
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:40,720
You came very far.

712
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,930
What is this?

713
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:54,010
I don't cook at home,
so I'll leave these here.

714
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:55,770
It's not that I don't like these.

715
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:58,320
Okay. You should go.

716
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,020
Let's go.

717
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,530
-Get a good rest.
-Okay.

718
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:10,070
-Thank you.
-Sure.

719
00:46:11,790 --> 00:46:13,460
What are you so curious about?

720
00:46:13,630 --> 00:46:17,020
Where have you really been?
What's with the rice and apples?

721
00:46:17,550 --> 00:46:18,610
Nothing much.

722
00:46:18,690 --> 00:46:21,070
Don't let me catch you
doing something weird, okay?

723
00:46:21,330 --> 00:46:23,270
I never do anything weird.

724
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:28,330
Anyway, Ji-hyang.
Could you pick up that ring for me?

725
00:46:28,730 --> 00:46:30,400
I want to find my dad again.

726
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:33,430
Let's contact that alumni group

727
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:34,930
and do everything we can.

728
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:38,410
Okay. Let's look for him.
We'll try doing everything we can.

729
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:41,750
So where have you been?
You've suddenly changed.

730
00:46:42,450 --> 00:46:43,550
Nowhere.

731
00:46:45,490 --> 00:46:46,590
Let's go.

732
00:46:59,790 --> 00:46:59,920
(Did you put
Mother's side dishes in the fridge?)

733
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,770
(Who-joon)
(Did you put
Mother's side dishes in the fridge?)

734
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:02,430
(Did you put
Mother's side dishes in the fridge?)

735
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:05,990
(You don't have to worry. Go to sleep.)

736
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:08,110
(Geun-young)
(You don't have to worry. Go to sleep.)

737
00:47:08,110 --> 00:47:08,850
(You don't have to worry. Go to sleep.)

738
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:11,760
"Mother"?

739
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:15,760
Well, it's a variety show,
but we're technically married,

740
00:47:16,730 --> 00:47:18,670
so she's my mother-in-law?

741
00:47:33,050 --> 00:47:33,320
(I'm still full from everything
your mom gave me.)

742
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:36,090
(Who-joon)
(I'm still full from everything
your mom gave me.)

743
00:47:36,090 --> 00:47:36,440
(Who-joon)

744
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:39,130
(Will you cook for me next time?)
(Who-joon)

745
00:47:46,170 --> 00:47:49,330
Unbelievable. He must be insane.

746
00:48:04,730 --> 00:48:06,320
Why? What?

747
00:48:20,970 --> 00:48:21,230
(It's me. I have something to say.)

748
00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:22,990
(Stranger)
(It's me. I have something to say.)

749

(It's me. I have something to say.)

750
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:26,600
(Can you call me
once you check this message?)

751
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:28,450
(I'll wait.)

752
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:31,350
Did you think I didn't know
you two were seeing each other?

753
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,290
If you two keep doing this,

754
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:36,770
will you get a grip
only after you see how wrecked she gets?

755
00:49:02,290 --> 00:49:03,650
Yes, Ms. No.

756
00:49:04,270 --> 00:49:05,150
Today?

757
00:49:05,230 --> 00:49:09,190
It's just an interview, so don't worry.
Be at the penthouse, okay?

758
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,390
Oh, okay.

759
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,340
We'll get ready for Who-joon's interview.
Please speed it up.

760
00:49:40,610 --> 00:49:43,470
-Look at this.
-What is it?

761
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:46,200
This is the best part.

762
00:49:46,330 --> 00:49:49,230
-Is this yours?
-This is hilarious. That's insane.

763
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:50,860
How can this be?

764
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,630
Look at that.

765
00:49:53,850 --> 00:49:55,920
-That's really awesome.
-My gosh.

766
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:58,600
That's hilarious.

767
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:02,210
So funny.

768
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:03,970
Will you check your phone?

769
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:06,440
That's unbelievable.

770
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:06,520
(Who-joon)

771
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:08,020

(Who-joon)

773
00:50:08,110 --> 00:50:09,470
(Are you all having fun without me?)
(Who-joon)

774
00:50:09,470 --> 00:50:10,130
(Are you all having fun without me?)

775
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:12,290
Let's begin the interview.

776
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:15,190
-That's good.
-My gosh.

777
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:15,410
(Spigen Entertainment, CEO Choi Jae-joon)
-That's good.
-My gosh.

(Spigen Entertainment, CEO Choi Jae-joon)

779

Mr. Choi.
(Spigen Entertainment, CEO Choi Jae-joon)

780
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:20,520
What's this?

781
00:50:21,350 --> 00:50:23,020
It got here this morning.

782
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,020
(Notice of Contract Cancellation)

Go get the chief manager
who's in charge of Oh In-hyung.

785
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:38,120
Yes, sir.

786
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:48,940
Mr. Choi.

787
00:50:49,730 --> 00:50:52,420
It's Who-joon's song
you recently listened to.

788
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:56,070
("Who-joon's Song Leaked!")

("Accident or Marketing?
Who is the Mysterious Female Singer?")

790
00:50:58,090 --> 00:51:00,910
Let's wrap up now. Great work today.

791
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:03,150
Who-joon's song must've been leaked out.

792
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:04,340
What?

793
00:51:04,910 --> 00:51:07,860
His first love

Who-joon and his girls are
all over the news.
(Who-joon's Song Leaked)

797
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,940
Who-joon and his girls are
all over the news.

798
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:12,660
What is this?

799
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:13,930
("Is It the Anti-Fan's Plan?")

800
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:17,630
Do these people think
an anti-fan is a criminal?

801
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:19,920
This is just awful.

802
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,810
-Great work.
-Wait, Geun-young.

803
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:27,350
Geun-young,
you better stay home quietly for a while.

804
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:29,420
-Why?
-Well...

805
00:51:29,510 --> 00:51:30,870
Is something going on?

806
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:34,390
Did something happen?

807
00:51:39,320 --> 00:51:40,820
("Fans Enraged with the Leakage")

808
00:51:44,470 --> 00:51:47,330
So, are you saying
In-hyung was there or not?

809
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:49,530
(She just said she wanted to listen.)

810
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:51,550
Darn it.

00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:18,700
-There he is.
-He's here.

815
00:52:25,610 --> 00:52:27,760
-Excuse me!
-One question!

816
00:52:27,850 --> 00:52:30,360
-Please say one word!
-Excuse me!

817
00:52:42,110 --> 00:52:44,660
What's with that face? Was it really you?

818
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:46,420
I thought you knew.

819
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:48,660
Have you gone insane?

820
00:52:49,720 --> 00:52:53,020
You leaked the song you sang with him?

821
00:52:53,110 --> 00:52:55,880
Everyone wants to know who the girl is,

822
00:52:55,970 --> 00:52:57,900
do you want me to expose
your relationship too?

823
00:52:58,430 --> 00:53:00,370
Weren't you going to do that anyway?

824
00:53:00,890 --> 00:53:04,280
All you care about now is that woman,
Lee Geun-young.

825
00:53:04,370 --> 00:53:07,890
Were you concerned
that you'll lose your position?

826
00:53:09,250 --> 00:53:11,370
I'm sure you were the one
who got concerned.

827
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:15,500
Do you think I had no idea

828
00:53:15,590 --> 00:53:18,490
you needed me here
to get Joon to sign with you?

829
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:21,490
But now it looks like
you won't need me anymore.

830
00:53:22,010 --> 00:53:23,110
Have you

831
00:53:24,080 --> 00:53:28,040
always been this suspicious of me?

832
00:53:28,130 --> 00:53:29,230
Then what about me?

833
00:53:30,070 --> 00:53:33,670
I never got to say anything
all wrapped up under your suspicion!

834
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:36,310
Do you think
everything is unfair only for you?

835
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,910
You two keep saying
everything is in the past

836
00:53:39,530 --> 00:53:41,900
and act like it's all behind you.

837
00:53:41,990 --> 00:53:44,280
Do you know how disgusting it is
for me to see that?

838
00:53:44,370 --> 00:53:45,910
That's enough!

839
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:51,710
I used to think everything would be fine
as long as I listen to you.

840
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:53,340
But

841
00:53:54,570 --> 00:53:56,730
I found out that
there are many replacements

842
00:53:57,570 --> 00:54:00,380
who do everything you want.

843
00:54:01,390 --> 00:54:02,850
Have I

844
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:07,250
ever been important to you in your life?

845
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:10,900
It sounds like

846
00:54:13,710 --> 00:54:15,340
you regret everything.

847
00:54:16,130 --> 00:54:18,070
Yes, I do.

848
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:21,020
I regret this to death. Happy now?

849
00:54:29,950 --> 00:54:31,360
I'm very sorry,

850
00:54:32,590 --> 00:54:35,050
but every single decision
you make from now on

851
00:54:37,030 --> 00:54:38,400
will be wrong.

852
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:41,610
Especially now.

853
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:00,790
But still.

854
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:05,720
At the very least,
you didn't have to say you regret it.

("Did the Anti-Fan Plan the Leak?")

856
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:18,300
Stay home until the reporters get quiet.

857
00:55:18,390 --> 00:55:21,560
The agency is trying to stop the articles.
You should go home.

858
00:55:32,870 --> 00:55:33,970
Joon.

859
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:36,340
Where are you going?

860
00:56:31,870 --> 00:56:33,850
Why are you here instead of home?

861
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:38,650
Why? Am I not allowed to be
at a friend's place?

862
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:48,990
Come with me.

863
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:50,660
To where?

864
00:57:07,470 --> 00:57:08,570
Excuse me.

865
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:20,890
Don't you regret becoming my anti-fan?

866
00:57:22,910 --> 00:57:24,010
Yes.

867
00:57:27,710 --> 00:57:28,810
A little.

868
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:36,510
I should've been calm back then.

869
00:57:39,810 --> 00:57:40,910
I should've let it go

870
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:45,310
even though I knew it was unfair.

871
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:48,300
Why did I do that?

872
00:57:53,800 --> 00:57:55,510
If I held back,

873
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:00,270
people wouldn't have hated me so much
whenever something like this

874
00:58:01,670 --> 00:58:03,430
broke out.

875
00:58:09,770 --> 00:58:10,870
I'm sorry.

876
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:13,510
People took this out on you

877
00:58:15,050 --> 00:58:16,330
all because of me.

878
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:18,570
I'm sorry to make you stay patient

879
00:58:19,010 --> 00:58:21,300
whenever something unfair happens.

880
00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:29,790
You can cry

881
00:58:30,890 --> 00:58:32,030
when you're with me.

882
00:58:35,690 --> 00:58:40,040
Man, this is so stressful.
They don't even know what they're saying.

883
00:58:41,270 --> 00:58:42,370
Unbelievable.

884
00:58:43,030 --> 00:58:46,820
Hey, you idiots! It wasn't Geun-young!
It wasn't Lee Geun-young!

885
00:58:46,910 --> 00:58:49,680
What are you doing? Are you crazy?
People are going to look at you.

886
00:58:50,070 --> 00:58:52,270
Why? Give it a try.
It makes you feel better.

887
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:55,090
Say it. Say that you didn't do it.

888
00:58:55,180 --> 00:58:56,280
It wasn't her!

889
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:59,140
What if people recognize you?

890
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:01,160
If you don't let it out, it can hurt you.

891
00:59:02,350 --> 00:59:03,540
Do it now.

892
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:05,910
You idiots!

893
00:59:08,290 --> 00:59:10,360
Do I seem like a joke to you?

894
00:59:10,930 --> 00:59:13,000
Do I seem like a pushover?

895
00:59:13,350 --> 00:59:15,860
You always blame me for everything.

896
00:59:15,950 --> 00:59:17,050
Why do you do that?

897
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:18,590
It wasn't me!

898
00:59:18,670 --> 00:59:19,770
It wasn't her!

899
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:23,250
See? Isn't that much better?

900
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:29,850
Do you sometimes shout out like this
when you get frustrated?

901
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:33,770
But it's not as good
when you do this alone.

902
00:59:33,850 --> 00:59:35,970
You have to do it with someone.

903
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:37,590
Well, I guess

904
00:59:40,540 --> 00:59:42,520
you can do this with me from now on.

905
00:59:51,670 --> 00:59:53,350
I'm hungry now that I feel better.

906
00:59:55,190 --> 00:59:56,470
Do you want to eat something?

907
00:59:57,090 --> 01:00:00,120
Okay. I was too concerned about you
that I didn't eat anything today.

908
01:00:00,210 --> 01:00:01,310
Let's go.

909
01:00:05,930 --> 01:00:07,030
Thank you.

910
01:00:11,340 --> 01:00:13,720
Don't cry, you crybaby.

911
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:29,690
Someone's calling you.

912
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:31,670
No, I'm not picking up.

913
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:33,740
Come on, pick it up.

914
01:00:34,310 --> 01:00:35,540
Who's calling at this hour?

915
01:00:42,140 --> 01:00:43,420
(Stranger)

916
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:45,440
What are you doing? Pick it up.

917
01:00:46,850 --> 01:00:47,950
Okay.

918
01:00:49,930 --> 01:00:51,030
One second.

919
01:00:56,620 --> 01:00:58,730
-What is...
(-Are you Oh In-hyung's guardian?)

920

(This is the hospital.)
