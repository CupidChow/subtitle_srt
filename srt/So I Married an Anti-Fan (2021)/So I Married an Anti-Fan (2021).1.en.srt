00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:38,450
My gosh.

161
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,750
(Wait, my flowers.)

162
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,040
(Wait, why should I hide?)

163
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,980
Hey!

164
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:06,790
Geun-young!

165
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:11,630
You crazy jerk!

166
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:15,590
Come here!

167
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,540
You get lost!

168
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,040
-You jerk!
-Hey, wait!

169
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:22,580
You crazy jerk!

170
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,700
And you. You're as bad as him!

171
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,900
Darn it, you two!

172
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:35,650
(But why is my heart beating so quickly?)

173
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:39,920
(Geun-young, you've imagined this moment
many times before.)

174
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:43,130
(You always told yourself
you'll walk over and tell him off)

175
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:45,820
(when you catch your boyfriend
having an affair.)

176
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:49,910
(But)

177
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:54,310
(this isn't quite what I imagined.)

178
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:02,970
(But nothing will change
even if I got mad.)

179
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:07,770
(My gosh, why am I trembling?
I didn't do anything wrong.)

180
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:10,150
Geun-young.

181
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:13,710
(I have to do something.)

182
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:30,910
This is mine.

183
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:46,270
We have ten minutes until we're on live
with the awards ceremony. Please hurry.

184
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,900
Hey, you're looking great.

185
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,700
Joon, do you have a speech ready?

186
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,520
Did I win the Grand Award?

187
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:54,100
We'll get connected once you do.

188
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,830
-Over here.
-Joon, let's get changed.

189
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:59,070
I heard everyone at the awards is
wearing black suits.

190
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,660
Why didn't they tell me sooner?

191
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,050
Why couldn't you tell me sooner?
I'll be on in ten minutes.

192
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,950
Let's hurry.
We have less than five minutes left.

193
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:18,040
Geun-young, it's not like that.

194
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:19,620
Then what is this?

195
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:20,850
I really wanted

196
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:24,370
to fall in love with you too, Geun-young.

197
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:27,010
I thought I could love a woman too.

198
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,290
I wanted to check and see

199
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,450
if I could never fall in love
with a woman again.

200
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,510
Then why do you have to check this

201
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,240
through me?

202
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:38,140
Why? Why did it have to be me?

203
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,900
Do I look like a piece of litmus paper?

204
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:42,100
Am I supposed to discern
if you're gay or bi?

205
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:44,040
Will you please be quiet?

206
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:50,070
And... And you're worried other people
may hear me in this situation?

207
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,560
Enough is enough.

208
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:55,000
You acted like you're the nicest person,
so why are you like this to me?

209
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,550
Have you always been this irrational?

210
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:01,900
But...

211
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,560
But at the very least...

212
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:11,100
At the very least,
shouldn't you apologize to me?

213
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:12,290
So what if I do?

214
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:15,060
Will it make you feel better?

215
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,490
You're a very patient woman.

216
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:21,920
Then at least be a good person
and stay patient to the end.

217
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:25,530
I seriously...

218
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:29,100
I really...

219
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,920
(I'm not being patient.)

220
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,230
(I just try hard to understand.)

221
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:55,230
How long has it been since we dated?
Five years? Six?

222
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:57,780
-Time flies, doesn't it?
-It does.

223
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,380
What did we do
on the last day of last year?

224
00:17:00,470 --> 00:17:01,920
Were we at a concert?

225
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:05,180
Anyway, how did you come up with an idea
to make the night this special?

226
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:07,770
(2020 Music Awards)

227
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:10,410
(This year, many songs and artists were)
(2020 Music Awards)

228
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,020
(loved very much domestically
and internationally.)

229
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:18,369
(The artist who was loved the most will
receive this award.)

230
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:21,410
(I'm also dying to know
who'll win this award.)

231
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:24,490
(And now, let me announce the winner.)

232
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:27,480
(The honor of the Grand Award goes to...)

233
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:30,910
-Who-joon! Who-joon!
-Who-joon! Who-joon!

234
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,520
Who-joon. The winner is Who-joon.
Congratulations.

235
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:39,800
(Who-joon is at his concert,
so we have him on the line right now.)

236
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:57,750
(Thank you. First off,
I'd like to thank my fans)

237
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:01,540
who are here with me right now.

238
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,400
And I really love you. I love you all!

239
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:05,850
Darn it.

240
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:10,120
I don't like
how his birthday is on the 31st.

241
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:14,210
Why does he always take the Grand Award
like it's his birthday cake?

242
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:17,160
Don't you think
I might have a chance next year?

243
00:18:17,510 --> 00:18:19,270
When will you have a new song for me?

244
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:21,730
Did you send a congratulatory message?

245
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,580
To celebrate what?

246
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:28,070
Don't pretend like you don't know.
It's Joon's birthday.

247
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:33,790
I didn't send it to him.

248
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,230
Right, did you hear how I had a meeting
with a film studio yesterday?

249
00:18:41,490 --> 00:18:44,390
Wouldn't it be great
to release the album along with the film?

250
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:48,130
Don't you get angry

251
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,530
that he's the only one who's a big shot?

252
00:18:55,130 --> 00:18:58,250
That's enough.
Is that all you have to talk about?

253
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:01,020
Hey, it's weirder for you to sit there

254
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,540
with a straight face
as if nothing had happened.

255
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:06,660
Can't you just play along
and bash him with me?

256
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:09,690
Is this why you wanted to see me?
So you can be jealous?

257
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,360
Jealous? Who's jealous?

258
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,880
Hey, you sitting right here, you're mine.

259
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:17,390
Your agency is mine. Everything is mine!

260
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,900
Jealous, my foot.

261
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,420
But you. Are you really mine?

262
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:39,610
I was so thrilled
he was taking me to this couple's party.

263
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:43,400
I had no idea.

264
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,860
I polished those shoes every day

265
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:49,470
as if those are my treasures
because that jerk bought those for me.

266
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,770
Then you bought a brand-name dress
and a bag despite your finances.

267
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:58,710
Yet you were patient with him,
and brought the flowers back home.

268
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,250
I wasn't being patient!

269
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,700
Okay, you weren't.

270
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:07,240
I waited eagerly
to put this on and go to that party.

271
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,960
I don't need this anymore.

272
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:10,410
Be more realistic.

273
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:13,010
Your credit card bill will remain
even if you threw that out.

274
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,720
You have 11 more months to pay that off.

275
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:17,450
Do you want to pay them off

276
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:20,310
without trying on the dress
or carrying the bag?

277
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,560
It's windy.

278
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,540
My life ended today.

279
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,120
Once the New Year's bell rings,

280
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:39,360
I'll be born again.

281
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:42,180
Hey, just wait and see.

282
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:44,510
I'll be a completely different person...

283
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:47,850
Why isn't the bell ringing?

284
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:50,630
It already did.

285
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,350
It did? When?

286
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:59,510
They ring that bell once a year,
and I missed that too?

287
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:02,900
My life is just too awful.

288
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:12,230
Eat this. Open up.

289
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,980
Is it good?

290
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:26,710
I want kimchi.

291
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,600
Kimchi. Okay.

292
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:30,970
Here comes kimchi.

293
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:17,970
It was a long flight, wasn't it? Let's go.

294
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:26,900
Come on in.

295
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,720
We have everything you'll need.

296

How was the talk show in the U.S.?

299
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,080
It was fun.

300
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,160
Are you all right?

301
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:36,590
I thought you'd be used to it by now.
Why don't you ever sleep on a plane?

302
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,180
To save my face.

303
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:43,630
This is the only place where I can relax.

304
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:49,310
You can just relax.
You're just fine as you are.

305
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,940
You're the biggest star right now.

306
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,060

difficult to figure out.
(Who-joon, yama)

310
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:01,980
Should I have just shown the ring?

311
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:03,650
Were you going to show it and say,

312
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:06,910
"The owner of this ring is my father,
so please come and find me"?

313
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,250
Do you think lots of people will come
and say, "He surely is my son"?

314
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,170
Then what now? Do we hold an audition?

315
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,230

what do you want me to do?

00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:33,310
Is it necessary to cover a story

319
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:35,640
of a scion of a rich man
throwing his money around?

320
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:39,470
He's right. JJ is infamous in this field.

321
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:42,150
He used his parents' fortune
to build an entertainment agency,

322
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,100
and he now made a club
to hang out with other rich kids like him.

323
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:47,030
Do we have to go there?

324
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:51,700
Have all of you always been
such serious journalists?

325
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:56,140
That rich scion
especially sent us an invitation.

326
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:59,180
If only we don't show up,
how will you deal with the consequences?

327
00:24:59,270 --> 00:25:02,430
He's not throwing money around,
he's trying to do art. This is art.

328
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,120
Who-joon is coming too,

329
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,970
so at least get his pictures.

330
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:09,960
It'll be a good story for our magazine
on how celebrities socialize.

331
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,430
Then you can just let Geun-young go.

332
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,480
She's right. It's about time
Geun-young covered a story by herself.

333
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,420
Come with me.

334
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,230
Then you can go, Geun-young.

335
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:37,280
You're taking the photos.

336
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:01,740
Welcome to the celebration
of Florence's debut.

337
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,780
-Cheers.
-Cheers!

338
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:14,020
My gosh. JJ can be so dramatic.

339
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,630
Everyone already knew
that they were an item.

340
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:20,530
You look as if you didn't know.

341
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,220
(Invitation to Club Benny,
Friday, July 6th, 2021)

342
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,040
Are those too much?

343
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:55,640
No, they aren't. I've only been
paying them off for seven months.

344
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,400
I won't get another chance to wear those.

345
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:02,160
Why are you walking like this?

346
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,840
Gosh, darn it.

347
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:07,700
He really didn't care much about me.
He didn't know my size.

348
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:09,640
These are big enough for men.

349
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,320
Maybe these were for his boyfriend.

350
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:13,680
If he's the feminine type...

351
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:18,080
No. No way. He was a tall guy.
He was like this big.

352
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,160
"Benny"?

353
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,580
Hey, isn't Benny Who-joon's English name?

Hey, isn't Benny Who-joon's English name?

(Party Tonight: Club Benny Opening Party)

356
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:28,730
Maybe those two are gay too.
(Party Tonight: Club Benny Opening Party)

357
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,050
Maybe those two are gay too.

358
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,430
The battery is out.

359
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:34,320
But I checked before we left.

360
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,400
Hold this. I have to go back to the car.

361
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:41,050
He's a rather clumsy type too.

362
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,430
Could it be Who-joon?

363
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:20,120
My gosh.

364
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,560
I'm sorry. I didn't know you were there.
Are you all right?

365
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,320
I'm fine.

366
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:46,790
I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were in there.

367
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:48,850
May I help you?

368
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:51,540
What? It's your car.

369
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:53,870
Your car looked cool.

370
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:56,640
-Did you take any...
-No.

371
00:28:56,950 --> 00:28:58,360
I didn't. Do you want to check?

372
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:01,750
No, I'm sorry. It was an odd situation,
so I just needed to check.

373
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:07,990
It's okay. She seems like a fan.

374
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:11,070
Anyway, I think we got here too early.
Should we stay in the car?

375
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,570
Okay. Let's wait here.

376
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,030
-Look over here.
-Look here, please.

377
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,800
-Look ahead. Over here.
-Look over here.

378
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:26,430
-Over here.
-Look over here.

379
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,580
-Look here.
-Right, I saw Who-joon.

380
00:29:28,670 --> 00:29:30,700
When? Did you take his picture?
If you did, let's go.

381
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,590
It was out of battery.

382
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,620
Anyway, Who-joon seemed like a good guy.

383
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:38,180
I'll ask him for an interview later.
I think he might say yes.

384
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,720
Why? What happened?

385
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,430
-Did you get her?
-Darn it.

386
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,070
-Look over here.
-One more shot, please.

387
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,120
Didn't this album go bust?

388
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:54,370
-All of his albums were failures.
-Hi, everyone.

389
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,560
-Hello.
-Hello.

390
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,320
Thank you for coming.

391
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,180
You've all grown a little tired
waiting for my friends, right?

392
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,980
When will Who-joon get here?

393
00:30:04,310 --> 00:30:07,390
I'm not taking questions at the moment.

394
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:13,990
Anyway, I hope everyone here could
enjoy the night as much as you'd like.

395
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,900
All the drinks are free tonight.
It's all on the house!

396
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,160
-And today...
-There he is!

397
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:23,360
-It's Who-joon.
-He's here.

398
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:25,390
-Who-joon!
-Look over here!

399
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,900
-Over here!
-Please look over here.

400
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:30,050
-Over here!
-Who-joon, over here!

401

-Who-joon, look over here. Over here!
-Who-joon!

402
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:34,890
Who-joon just got here.

403
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:38,410
-Who-joon, please come this way.
-Look over here!

404
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:43,340
You came here despite your busy schedule.

405
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:44,530
You're a loyal friend.

406
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:47,300
-Over here!
-Look over here.

407
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:49,020
-Who-joon, over here.
-Finger heart!

408
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,300
-Make a finger heart!
-Over here!

409
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:54,690
Everyone, have fun tonight.
Turn the volume up!

410
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:08,070
I thought you were abroad until yesterday.

411
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:10,090
Aren't you tired?
I can't believe you came.

412
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:12,030
Because it'd make your life hard
if I don't come.

413
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:14,140
You probably told everyone I was coming.

414
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:16,210
If I didn't come,
you'd be awkward before reporters.

415
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,630
I didn't want you to feel awkward.

416
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:21,970
You and your words.

417
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:26,190
This is why I can't hate you.

418
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:31,780
Anyway, why didn't you leave him behind
when you came here?

419
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:40,490
No manager would
send the star alone into the jungle.

420
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:44,230
Let's go, Ji-hyang.

421
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:52,150
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

422
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,060
We're from "Wonder Woman."

423
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:57,920
Could you say a word to our readers?

424
00:31:58,010 --> 00:31:59,990
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

425
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,330
I think we're about done.

426
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:06,670
Let's grab a drink too.
I heard he has a booth for reporters.

427
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,230
I don't even see a glimpse of Who-joon.

428
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:13,580
I need to get his exclusive interview
to make Mean Moon-hee quiet.

429
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:15,830
I'm sure the VIPs are
hanging out by themselves.

430
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:18,290
I'm sure he'll show up at least once.

431
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:19,920
Let's go.

432
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:21,550
-Take this.
-I'll have it.

433
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:22,820
All right.

434
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:25,070
Thanks.

435
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:26,520
Doing all right?

436
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:32,850
Do you still have Ji-hyang assist you
with everything like a little kid?

437
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,200
Wait, were you older?

438
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:39,720
Is it because I've known you
since when you were young?

439
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:41,390
You seem like a younger guy.

440
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:44,210
If he was older then,
I'm sure he's still older.

441
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:46,190
Yes, you're right.

442
00:32:46,630 --> 00:32:50,100
So? Do you want me to treat you
with some elderly respect?

443
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:55,730
Jae-joon, you've changed a lot.
You can actually show respect.

444
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,470
-You were all here.
-You're here.

445
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:02,290
The rising star of Shooting Star.

446
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,650
Congrats, JJ.

447
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,690
Anyway, I thought you flew back in today.

448
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:08,620
Why didn't you call me?

449
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,660
So this is why it's the VIP party.
The food is good.

450
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:13,460
The main chef is Roy.

451
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:16,280
Roy? Roy is a great chef, after all.

452
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:19,230
Roy? That Roy? That jerk is here?

453
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,820
Do you think he saw me?
If he did, he probably missed my shoes.

454
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:25,120
Calm down. That happened ages ago.

455
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:27,240
Even if he saw you now, what would he do?

456
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:31,990
Right? Well, you know.
Come to think about it,

457
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,420
I'm sure he had no choice
if his feelings go that way.

458
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:37,710
Yes, and I'm sure he forgot
what you looked like.

459
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:42,640
Hey, I'm not a woman
who's easily forgettable.

460
00:33:49,150 --> 00:33:50,470
Nope, not the case.

461
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,540
Gosh, darn it.

462
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,670
In-hyung, over here.

463
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,150
Ji-hyang, may I have a word?

464
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:02,440
Will you be okay?

465
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,020
Go ahead.

466
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:09,210
In-hyung, you're here.

467
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,400
Take a seat.

468
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:18,139
She looks much different
from six years ago, right?

469
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:21,139
I'm not sure if he remembers.

470
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:27,210
It has been a while.

471
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:31,170
It has. Have you been well?

472
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:34,510
He has been doing the best
among the three of us.

473
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,800
He released albums, dramas, and films.

474
00:34:36,889 --> 00:34:37,989
You're right.

475
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:42,030
That's why I haven't had the time
to see you or In-hyung.

476
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:44,500
It's okay.

477
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:47,310
We've been busy too. Right?

478
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:55,320
Do you know what the worst part is?

479
00:34:55,409 --> 00:34:58,890
Of course, it's miserable to think
my ex-boyfriend was gay.

480
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:01,700
But he's still a celebrity chef

481
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:05,970
while I'm still a nobody like this.
That's what makes me miserable.

482
00:35:07,510 --> 00:35:09,670
Yes, you do seem miserable.

483
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,240
My friend,
this is when you say things like,

484
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:19,080
"Don't say that, Geun-young.
You're already beautiful and wonderful."

485
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:20,580
That's what you say.

486
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:24,670
My friend, I'm the unfortunate friend
who has to drag your hammered body home.

487
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:26,830
Please don't forget that.

488
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:28,450
You're right.

489
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,820
Where are you going?

490
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:35,670
To take a leak.

491
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:40,690
This is expensive,

492
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:42,450
so keep it well.

493
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:44,380
Yes, Master!

494
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:58,810
Have you been well?

495
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:02,030
Can't you tell?

496
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,830
What's wrong?

497
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,030
You said you understand.

498
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:09,240
Yes.

499
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:12,630
Isn't that good enough?

500
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:23,060
Did he drown in the toilet?
Why isn't he coming?

501
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:33,310
The restroom.

502
00:36:35,290 --> 00:36:36,390
Who-joon?

503
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:44,750
He hit her.

504
00:36:49,630 --> 00:36:52,540
My gosh. I can't believe that guy.

505
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,640
Excuse me.

506
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:24,000
-Did you take any...
-No.

507
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,940
I didn't. Do you want to check?

508
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:28,480
The woman at the car?

509
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,960
Who are you? A stalker?

510
00:37:34,340 --> 00:37:35,830
No, I'm not a stalker.

511
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:39,130
Give me your camera.

512
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:42,960
Give it to me.

513
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,230
This is warm.

514
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,470
Have you gone crazy?

515
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,130
I can't believe this.

516
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,570
I'm sorry.

517
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:22,950
Ji-hyang, grab my shoes from the car
and meet me at the emergency exit.

518
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,140
Hurry.

519
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:27,180
I'm sorry.

520
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:29,950
Starting now, do not say a word.

521
00:38:30,790 --> 00:38:32,720
I thought I should apologize.

522
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:36,900
No, you should've stayed away
from doing anything to apologize.

523
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:40,290
I can't believe my luck.

524
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:48,910
Hey, I'm sorry about this.

525
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,480
But you can't suddenly destroy my camera.
Do you know how much that costs?

526
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:54,940
How much is it? I'll pay for it.

527
00:38:55,430 --> 00:38:59,030
Do you think money can resolve everything?
You have no basic manners.

528
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:03,610
No matter how big of a celebrity you are,
you should have some manners.

529
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,940
You didn't even hear me out
before you got mad at me.

530
00:39:06,030 --> 00:39:07,130
Hear you out?

531
00:39:08,410 --> 00:39:10,740
It's not my first time
running into someone like you.

532
00:39:11,270 --> 00:39:14,480
You lurked around with a camera before,
then you snuck up on me again.

533
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:15,710
Yet you want me to let it go?

534
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,950
How many times do I have to say
I didn't take any photos?

535
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,420
Maybe that's it. You pretend like
you have such good manners on TV,

536
00:39:24,510 --> 00:39:26,670
but it looks like
you got something on your conscience.

537
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:28,910
What are you doing over there?

538
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:34,060
Hey, is this mine?

539
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:36,350
-I didn't do that.
-Is this yours?

540
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,140
What's going on here?

541
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:42,550
-Are you his manager?
-Yes.

542
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,420
Your celebrity broke our camera
and began to slander us.

543
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:51,040
I apologized for that,
but he wouldn't accept it,

544
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:53,990
-then began to get mad...
-We're with "Wonder Woman."

545
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,310
Her name is Lee Geun-young.

546
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,040
You're a reporter?

547
00:39:58,210 --> 00:40:00,850
And what did you say?
You weren't going to take any photos?

548
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,740
Does he have clinical trust issues?

549
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:04,860
Because of trashy journos like you.

550
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:06,750
A trashy journo?

551
00:40:06,840 --> 00:40:09,120
Anybody can carry a camera
and write articles like you.

552
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:10,400
Hey!

553
00:40:10,490 --> 00:40:12,200
I can't believe my luck.

554
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:14,540
I think there was a misunderstanding.

555
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:17,480
-We'll reimburse the camera.
-Okay.

556
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:21,090
I can't believe that jerk.

557
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:23,600
Hey, I thought you said
he seemed like a good guy.

558
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:26,860
I was fooled,
along with every woman in Korea.

559
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,040
Where are you going?

560
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,080
I said you shouldn't come.

561
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:36,710
Is this what you came to see?

562
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:38,780
Isn't that the same talk we had
on the way here?

563
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:40,190
In that case, I'll take a taxi.

564
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:42,340
I knew you'd say that. Goodness.

565
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,370
Stay here. Let me get the car.

566
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:50,750
Hey!

567
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:56,600
You need to apologize before you go.

568
00:40:56,730 --> 00:41:01,000
Hey, if you're drunk,
just go home quietly.

569
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:03,420
Look at you.

570
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:06,540
You're finally speaking politely
now that you're out here.

571
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,740
Should I tell everyone
what I just witnessed?

572
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:14,020
If you don't apologize politely,
I won't just sit around either.

573
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,310
I'll expose everything.

574
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:20,540
If I apologize,
will it make you feel better?

575
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:23,970
I know your kind when I see one.

576
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:26,300
You never say something like this
to anyone else,

577
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,370
but you got all emotional,

578
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:30,700
then wanted
to get something out of this, no?

579
00:41:30,790 --> 00:41:32,850
What? I wasn't like this from the start.

580
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:35,450
I was patient enough.

581
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:38,750
I'm sorry for what I did,
but if you just apologized back there,

582
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:41,790
I wouldn't have run up here
where people are around.

583
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:49,310
If you're going to be patient,
stay patient to the end.

584
00:41:51,990 --> 00:41:53,620
You're a very patient woman.

585
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:57,230
Then at least be a good person
and stay patient to the end.

586
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:09,150
You!

587
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,580
You should've behaved while I was patient!

588
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:36,830
-That little...
-Who-joon, no. Don't do that.

589
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:38,990
She just hit my face!

590
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:50,160
("Who Joon Assaulted with a Shoe,
Who is the Mysterious Woman?")

591
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:54,390
("A Drunken Assault by H Woman")

592
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:56,670
(Who's the woman
that threw her shoe at Who-joon?)

593
00:42:57,110 --> 00:42:59,970
("What Happened?
Who-joon Hit with an Angry Heel")

594
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:29,580
-You're here.
-Hey.

595
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:40,060
-As you expected...
-Thankfully, it didn't leave a scar.

596
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:47,930
Okay.

597
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:53,520
("What Happened?
Who-joon Hit with an Angry Heel")

598
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,700
What do you think she saw?

599
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:02,320
-She saw me with In-hyung.
-What?

600
00:44:03,990 --> 00:44:05,490
Come on.

601
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:14,330
"Wonder Woman"? I think we're doing
an overseas project with them next month.

602
00:44:15,870 --> 00:44:17,630
("Wonder Woman", Ko Su-hwan)

603
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:26,780
I can't believe you didn't get any photos
while everyone else took thousands.

604
00:44:27,880 --> 00:44:30,830
It's not that we didn't take any photos.
It's the camera.

605
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:33,210
Yes, I heard the camera is destroyed too.

606
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:37,080
I sent you to cover the story.
What did you two do there?

607
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:41,300
Geun-young, you were
always dying to have a solo coverage.

608
00:44:41,390 --> 00:44:44,300
Did you finally realize
why I never gave you a chance?

609
00:44:45,570 --> 00:44:49,180
There was
an inevitable situation yesterday...

610
00:44:49,270 --> 00:44:53,100
No way.
Who-joon was hit with a shoe yesterday.

611
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:56,170
(And that's why)

612
00:44:57,050 --> 00:44:58,150
I can't do the photoshoot.

613
00:44:58,590 --> 00:44:59,690
Why not?

614
00:45:00,050 --> 00:45:02,510
One of the reporters there is stalking me.

615
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:03,830
Please make it known to them

616
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:07,570
that if they publish any nonsense,
I'll never work with them again.

617
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:09,200
What did she see?

618
00:45:09,370 --> 00:45:12,100
She took something the wrong way
and threatened to expose it.

619
00:45:12,590 --> 00:45:15,180
Who's this lunatic? What's her name?

620
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,310
Lee Geun-young.

621
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:20,590
Will you do the photoshoot
if I get rid of her?

622
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:22,570
Do you always have to make a deal?

623
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:24,600
Don't get me mad
this early in the morning.

624
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:27,060
No matter how big you are,

625
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:30,410
I'm the one who got rid of everything
that stands in the way of your success.

626
00:45:30,490 --> 00:45:33,620
So do you want this hindrance gone or not?

627
00:45:33,710 --> 00:45:36,650
Yes, I know how good you are at this.

628
00:45:37,310 --> 00:45:38,990
So please make this happen too.

629
00:45:39,070 --> 00:45:40,880
(I'll take care of everything.)

630
00:45:41,270 --> 00:45:44,660
Don't go out on another schedule,
and just take the steps as you're told.

631
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:47,480
Did you hang up?

632
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:52,100
Ms. Cha,
our editor-in-chief wants to see you.

633
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:06,270
I think everything ended
without big trouble, my friend.

634
00:46:06,350 --> 00:46:10,010
Really? I think it just ended with,
"That's for you, Geun-young."

635
00:46:10,310 --> 00:46:12,560
There's something else
that'll make you feel better.

636
00:46:12,650 --> 00:46:16,470
They contacted me first last night
and offered to send me a camera,

637
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,720
the most recent model
with the best performance.

638
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:21,530
I think this case was
wrapped up pretty smoothly.

639
00:46:21,620 --> 00:46:23,290
That's very comforting.

640
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,270
("What Happened?
Who-joon Hit with an Angry Heel")

641
00:46:34,070 --> 00:46:36,410
(Who-joon became a victim of assault.)

642
00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:41,240
Geun-young, have you gone insane?

643
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,720
Hey, you're barefooted!

644
00:46:52,290 --> 00:46:53,480
An angry heel?

645
00:46:56,860 --> 00:46:59,330
(I guess it could've been much worse.)

646
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:02,500
Let's just glide over this quietly
and quickly.

647
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:05,360
I brought coffee.

648
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:06,850
Hey, Geun-young.

649
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:09,450
Ms. Cha wants to see you in her office.

650
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:10,900
-Again?
-Yes.

651
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:12,920
Go on.

652
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:15,340
-Strawberry juice is mine.
-Okay.

653
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:24,630
I heard you wanted to see me.

654
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:26,700
Geun-young.

655
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:29,820
You're fired as of today.

656
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:31,840
Sorry?

657
00:47:33,910 --> 00:47:36,110
I said you're fired.

658
00:47:37,780 --> 00:47:40,560
Why are you suddenly telling me this?

659
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:45,040
What happened
between you and Who-joon last night?

660
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:49,220
We almost lost the special photoshoot
we were going to do with him!

661
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:53,760
-What?
-Do you pick fights with entertainers now?

662
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:57,410
Ms. Cha, I didn't do that for no reason.

663
00:47:57,940 --> 00:48:00,090
Do you know what he called us?

664
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:02,510
He called us trashy journos.
How can I let that go?

665
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:04,540
He said that for no reason?

666
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:06,300
It's a complicated situation.

667
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:09,290
I had a camera on me,
and he thought I was taking photos of...

668
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:10,700
Well, you were trashy.

669
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:12,500
-Ms. Cha.
-Is this unfair?

670
00:48:12,810 --> 00:48:16,110
I honestly don't get it.
I thought you'd agree to leave right away.

671
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,750
Are you telling me this
after seeing how hard I work?

672
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:21,610
It's me, Geun-young, the woman who worked
on Christmas and New Year's Day

673
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:23,320
-without taking a leave.
-So what?

674
00:48:23,590 --> 00:48:24,950
What kind of work did you do?

675
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:27,110
You never turned in any good proposals.

676
00:48:27,190 --> 00:48:30,270
You already received
over ten of my proposals.

677
00:48:35,470 --> 00:48:36,570
Director Lee.

678
00:48:37,270 --> 00:48:39,600
-Hey, long time no see.
-Have you been well?

679
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:42,110
I'm all right.
Who are you working with now?

680
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:44,220
Hello, I'm Oh In-hyung.

681
00:48:44,310 --> 00:48:46,330
She was a member

682
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:49,330
of Florence, a girl group.

683
00:48:49,410 --> 00:48:51,880
I see. She must be pretty old.

684
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:53,510
-I'll do my best.
-Okay.

685
00:48:53,590 --> 00:48:56,590
-Help us out, please.
-I don't have that much power.

686
00:48:57,990 --> 00:49:00,460
Isn't that Who-joon? That's Who-joon.

687
00:49:00,550 --> 00:49:03,320
Wait, my program proposal.
Hey, where's my proposal?

688
00:49:11,550 --> 00:49:14,670
-Who-joon, it has been so long.
-Hello.

689
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:17,090
-Have you been well, Director Lee?
-Of course.

690
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:19,990
Anyway, we're going to do
this huge special...

691
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:22,500
Director Lee, may we contact you
after we check the schedule?

692
00:49:22,590 --> 00:49:24,130
We have to be on the move.

693
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:27,120
Yes, all right. Take this.

694
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:29,670
Please take a good look, Mr. Seo.

695
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:32,800
Who-joon, please give it a good thought.

696
00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:35,790
Of course, this is your program.

697
00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:39,350
Thanks a lot. Okay?

698
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:47,320
Director Lee,
are you doing a special program?

699
00:49:47,410 --> 00:49:48,680
No, not really.

700
00:49:48,770 --> 00:49:50,400
Can we set up a meeting?

701
00:49:50,490 --> 00:49:52,600
-I'll do my best.
-She'll do her best.

702
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:53,960
Please consider it.

703
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:08,520
Please consider it.

704
00:50:08,610 --> 00:50:10,280
-She'll do her best.
-I'll do my best.

705
00:50:10,370 --> 00:50:11,650
All right.

706
00:50:13,190 --> 00:50:15,610
In-hyung, what brings you here?

707
00:50:17,630 --> 00:50:19,390
Have you been well?

708
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,300
Are you two acquainted?

709
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:25,110
Of course. She's a close friend.

710
00:50:26,210 --> 00:50:30,260
-Please do consider her, Director Lee.
-Yes, of course.

711
00:50:30,350 --> 00:50:33,250
Then you have to appear on my program
one of these days.

712
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:35,540
All right. I'll get going, then.

713
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:37,870
-Keep it up, In-hyung.
-Okay. Bye.

714
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:40,560
All right.

715
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:47,950
Are they close?

716
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:49,140
Well...

717
00:50:50,850 --> 00:50:52,350
You should all be careful.

718
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:54,330
Even if she steals your proposals

719
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:57,100
and you run all of her errands,
she won't hesitate to fire me.

720
00:50:57,190 --> 00:51:00,800
Once I'm gone, someone else will
have to be the next Geun-young.

721
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:03,480
Who wants to be it? You?

722
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:06,160
If you're leaving, leave quietly.

723
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:08,100
How dare you stir them up?

724
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:10,080
Doing this won't change anything.

725
00:51:10,170 --> 00:51:11,270
It should change.

726
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,730
They have a right to know.

727
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:17,740
The painful words
you shoot out of your mouth

728
00:51:17,820 --> 00:51:21,040
may seem like a callus to their heart
that'll protect them from the world,

729
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:23,500
but in the end,
it'll be thrown out like dead skin cells.

730
00:51:23,590 --> 00:51:26,100
They don't have a boss
who'll show them loyalty or consideration.

731
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:29,620
Shouldn't I take a stand
and wake them up to reality as I leave?

732
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:40,130
I'll let you do this.

733
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:42,680
You can feel sorry for a long time.

734
00:51:42,770 --> 00:51:45,940
You may not feel sorry now,
but it'll come to you in time,

735
00:51:46,950 --> 00:51:48,890
if you have a drop of conscience.

736
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:53,860
Sure. I hope you meet a boss like that.

737
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:02,440
-Geun-young.
-Why would she slap you?

738
00:52:02,790 --> 00:52:05,120
Geun-young. Your strawberry juice.

Hey, where are you going?

741
00:52:46,440 --> 00:52:49,390
Why does the world do this to me?

742
00:52:50,350 --> 00:52:52,860
I haven't had a sip of this.

743
00:52:54,230 --> 00:52:55,330

wasn't my competence, but something else.

Okay. Drink up and cheer up too.

00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:55,830
-Mi-jung.
-What?

789
00:56:55,910 --> 00:56:57,410
I left my home.

790
00:56:58,380 --> 00:56:59,960
Why?

791
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:03,300
Why did you leave
when you have a house of your own?

792
00:57:03,390 --> 00:57:06,560
I didn't think they'd cut off electricity
for not paying the maintenance fee.

793
00:57:06,650 --> 00:57:09,020
Then you can just move out.

794
00:57:09,110 --> 00:57:10,870
Yes, I should do that, right?

795
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:12,850
But it's under my mom's name, so I can't.

796
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:15,270
I'll stay just for a while.

797
00:57:15,620 --> 00:57:16,900
Just for a little while, please?

798
00:57:16,990 --> 00:57:19,580
I'll leave as soon as I get reinstated.

799
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:22,220
Do you have a plan?

800
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:36,170
(How may I help you?)

801
00:57:37,450 --> 00:57:39,470
I'm here to see Who-joon.

802
00:57:39,650 --> 00:57:41,580
(Please contact his manager.)

803
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:44,490
No, I know his number already. But...

804
00:57:49,770 --> 00:57:51,310
You can't just go in here.

805
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:53,730
Sir, I'm not a solicitor.

806
00:57:53,820 --> 00:57:55,180
I'm here on business.

807
00:57:55,270 --> 00:57:57,290
You obviously look like Who-joon's fan.

808
00:57:57,380 --> 00:57:59,840
You can't go in there.
Look at those girls.

809
00:57:59,930 --> 00:58:03,450
Sir, what do you mean,
I look like that man's fan?

810
00:58:03,850 --> 00:58:06,000
-Then who are you?
-A reporter.

811
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:07,460
Please leave.

812
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:10,490
Goodbye.

813
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:33,060
(Stranger)

814
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:35,750
(I'm not sure if you still
use this number, but thanks.)
(Stranger)

815
00:58:35,750 --> 00:58:36,360
(I'm not sure if you still
use this number, but thanks.)

816
00:59:38,010 --> 00:59:38,400
(Results for Who-joon)

817
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,290
See? I knew it.
The nation's favorite star, my foot.
(Results for Who-joon)

818
00:59:40,290 --> 00:59:41,750
See? I knew it.
The nation's favorite star, my foot.

819
00:59:42,190 --> 00:59:44,300
There are a few who are suspicious of him.

820
00:59:44,390 --> 00:59:46,500
-Really?
-Look at this.

821
00:59:46,590 --> 00:59:49,400
This guy who's flipping someone off
on the motorcycle is obviously him.

822
00:59:49,490 --> 00:59:50,770
That helmet is covering his face.

823
00:59:50,850 --> 00:59:53,140
No, it's because you haven't seen him.

824
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:55,390
Look at that nasty finger.

825
00:59:55,470 --> 00:59:58,730
His silhouette looks just like him.
Look at that Grim Reaper vibe.

826
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:01,500
My friend, you said
everyone kicked you out today.

827
01:00:01,590 --> 01:00:04,010
What'll happen to your reinstatement plan?

828
01:00:04,670 --> 01:00:05,860
Don't worry.

829
01:00:06,210 --> 01:00:08,540
If he fired me, then went onto ignore me,

830
01:00:08,630 --> 01:00:10,870
now I have no reason to go easy on him.

831
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:17,250
(I wish to expose Who-joon's dark side!)

832
01:00:17,340 --> 01:00:21,830
(Korea's hottest star, Who-joon,
is a man who assaults women.)

833
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:27,590
(I'd like to denounce how a man like him
has been deeply loved in Korea.)

834
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:29,970
(People say one's true colors will
always shine through.)

835
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:34,630
(Before Who-joon shows his true nature
and brings international shame to Korea,)

836
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:38,110
(I, Lee Geun-young, would like to step up
and expose his nature)

837
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:40,350
(for our people,
no, the world to find out.)

838
01:00:40,440 --> 01:00:44,220
(I attach the details of the incident.)

839
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:49,200
(Please contact me
if you have more questions.)

840
