I'll grab a drink to celebrate

13
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,900
This is great.

-My gosh.
(-The door is opened.)

(The door is locked.)

16
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:28,050
What are you doing here?

17
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,770
What about you?

18
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:34,079
Well, I was just passing by.

19
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,980
I was passing by too.

20
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:38,440
How did you get in here?

21
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,820
You told me the passcode earlier.

22
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:43,230
Right. The passcode.

23
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:46,840
You could have just passed by.
Why did you come in?

24
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:48,510
Well, while passing by...

25
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:51,460
While passing by,

26
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:55,640
I found a store selling this.

27
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:57,970
So I thought I might as well grab a bite.

28
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,610
Have you eaten yet? Aren't you hungry?

29
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:05,410
Since you were also passing by,

30
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:09,010
why don't you have some soju with me?

31
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:29,870
Aren't you eating the food?

32
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,060
I don't eat such things.

33
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,930
You drink soju though.

34
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,079
By the way, what brings you here
at this hour?

35
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:43,640
Am I obliged to tell you that?

36
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:49,230
Well, isn't it unfair
that I should tell you why I'm here

37
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:51,960
and you don't have to tell me
why you're here?

38
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:53,190
Wait.

39
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,620
What's with that bag?

40
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,140
Are you

41
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:02,740
backpacking to eat some tteokbokki?

42
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,030
Excuse me?

43
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:11,670
If you aren't going to answer me, get out.

44
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,940
Fine. I'm crashing here for a while.

45
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:30,460
And it hasn't even been an hour yet
since I started crashing here.

46
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:35,690
I didn't intend to come here though.
I somehow ended up here.

47
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,210
Let's be honest. This is an empty place.

48
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,530
And it should stay empty.

49
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,420
I had some situations.

50
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:44,840
I know you're not the kind of person
who would care though.

51
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:47,260
Are you saying
you're going to settle down here?

52
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,110
Who said I'm settling down?

53
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,150
I said I'm just crashing here for a while.

54
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,060
Plus, you are one of the reasons
why I'm here...

55
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:01,340
As a matter of fact, you are
99 percent of the reasons why I'm here.

56
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,020
-So?
-So...

57
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,860
So I'm saying you cannot stop me.

58
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:10,800
I think I deserve some help from you.

59
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:16,480
Hey, is that how you talk
to someone you owe?

60
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:19,910
It's not like you own this place.
Don't be so fussy.

61
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,350
Anyway, you can't.

62
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,590
You can't stay here.

63
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:35,620
I can't believe this.

64
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,350
This is my place.

65
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,790
I know it isn't.

66
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:09,980
What happened yesterday?

67
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:44,430
What?

68
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,310
Okay, okay.

69
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:49,890
Keep it together.

70
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:20,910
Hey.

71
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,850
Hey, wake up.

72
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:27,250
-What's up?
-Gosh, you scared me.

73
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:30,410
Did you sleep here last night?
Why on earth did you sleep here?

74
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,600
What?

75
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:33,670
You told me to stay.

76
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,440
When did I say that?

77
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:39,480
Don't you remember?

78
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,360
Fine. I'll go.

79
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:50,120
You think I came here
because I have nowhere else to go?

80
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,720
There are a lot of people who want me.

81
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,100
Just...

82
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,990
Just stay here.

83
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:14,020
"Just stay here." That's what you said.

84
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:19,120
Gosh, this is just...
How much did you make me drink?

85
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:23,650
Stop being old school.

86
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:26,690
Are you pretending
not to remember anything?

87
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:30,120
You told me to stay,

88
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:33,950
and I don't really have
anywhere else to go.

89
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:37,030
I'll be crashing here for the time being,

90
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,809
so I want you to stop dropping by
at late night.

91
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:45,040
You can go now. I'll get some more sleep.

92
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,880
Excuse me.

93
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,560
Hey.

94
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,800
Hey, wake up.

95
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,450
What is it?

96
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:11,920
Fine. I'll let you stay here.

97
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,820
But promise me not to let anyone know
that you're here.

98
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,180
Why would I want others to know
that I'm here?

99
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:26,920
You turned this house
into a complete mess.

100
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,690
What have I done to deserve this?

101
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:06,870
-Hey, how was the workout?
-It was tough.

102
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,900
Don't you think
you're dressed too casually?

103
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:11,270
I can't put on a suit after a workout.

104
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,170
Something's going on.

105
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:16,770
Excuse me for a second.

106
00:10:27,690 --> 00:10:29,840
Hello. Health is our first priority,

107
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:32,090
and we, Get It Diet, present

108
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:34,460
our first solution, boxing.

109
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:36,660
Let's leave out this part.

110
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,380
Okay.

111
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:43,830
It's an educational show.

112
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,250
It looks like she introduces diet boxing
as a reporter.

113
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,660
Let's take a break here.

114
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,820
Okay.

115
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,540
Joon, I think you should
stay away from her.

116
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:53,730
Let's go.

117
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:02,090
Joon.

118
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,360
-Excuse me.
-Yes?

119
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:41,520
Where is Ms. Oh In-hyung?

120
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:45,170
We're taking a break,
so she's probably using the bathroom.

121
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:46,490
Okay.

122
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,120
What are you doing here?

123
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:12,090
Well, the shoot is being delayed,
so I was on standby.

124
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,770
Did you come here alone for the shoot?

125
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:18,340
Well, there's an important event
at the agency, so the staff...

126
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:22,040
Does your agency assign you
a different amount of staff

127
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:24,330
depending on your significance?

128
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,320
Why would you care?

129
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:30,970
You said we're not supposed
to care about each other anymore.

130
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,830
Just because no one has come with you

131
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,090
doesn't mean you are no one.

132
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:57,680
Hello. Health is our first priority,

133
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:00,980
and we, Get It Diet, present

134
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:03,310
our first solution, boxing.

135
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,330
Boxing is one of the exercises

136
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:08,500
where you can consume
the most calories within a short time.

137
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:11,140
Now, let me introduce you a boxing expert

138
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:15,100
who will teach us some boxing moves
we can easily do at home.

139
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:16,770
All right. Let's call it a day.

140
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:19,590
-Good work, everyone.
-Well done.

141
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:23,590
Good work, guys.

142
00:13:23,810 --> 00:13:25,270
Good work, everyone.

143
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,050
Hey, when did you come?

144
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,730
Did you come here alone?
Without any staff?

145
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:36,790
Well, the schedule was fixed
at the last minute, so...

146
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,820
My manager is coming later to pick me up.

147
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:40,010
I see.

148
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:49,200
Isn't the schedule fixed
at the last minute, not a schedule?

149
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:51,840
How do I, the CEO, not know
about this decision?

150
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,300
I'll see you at the next meeting.

151
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,890
I know you're doing that to impress me.

152
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,270
I'm okay. Let's go.

153
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,590
You should put some clothes on.

154
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:12,870
Let's go.

155
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,900
(Actor Who-joon said showing his true self
would put a stop to the rumors.)

156
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,100
"True self"?
(Actor Who-joon said showing his true self
would put a stop to the rumors.)

157
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:32,850
Once his true self is revealed,
you guys won't be able to handle it.

158
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,160
(It's like giving a fish to a crazy cat.)

159
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,700
"Crazy cat"?
(It's like giving a fish to a crazy cat.)

160
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:40,110
(It's like throwing a poor baby swan
to an evil duck.)

161
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:41,380
"Evil duck"?
(It's like throwing a poor baby swan
to an evil duck.)

162
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,230
Me? Am I the evil duck?

163
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,310
That's unfair.

164
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:51,590
I had no idea I would ever be called
a crazy cat or an evil duck.

165
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,510
-Yes, Director Han.
(-Hey, Geun-young.)

166
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,060
We're grabbing a drink
with Who-joon before the shoot begins.

167
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,820
Tomorrow night. You can come, right?

168
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,500
Who's buying the drinks?

169
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,840
You said you were going to park the car.
Where have you been?

170
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,630
-I was buying this.
-Is that a present?

171
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:19,440
But it's not my birthday today.
What is it?

172
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:22,740
I figured out
that your hoodie was way too big for you.

173
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:27,540
I can't let my artist wear
something like that. It doesn't suit you.

174
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,880
When did you buy it?

175
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:33,700
I can't even remember.

176
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:36,910
You can't even remember?

177
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:39,730
Yes. It's a long time ago.

178
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,180
Just because no one has come with you
doesn't mean you are no one.

179
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:56,670
I see.

180
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,010
Then you should just throw it away.

181
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,740
Where is it?

182
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:05,380
I'll throw it away for you.

183
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:09,690
What are you doing? What's this all about?

184
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:20,690
My father said, in order to be successful,
one should know what to throw away.

185
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:23,240
You said you wanted to be successful.

186
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:29,580
You should throw away things
that don't fit you, like this hoodie.

187
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,880
Stop being sarcastic.

188
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,610
What is it this time you don't like about?

189
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,400
If you hadn't lied to me,

190
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,290
I wouldn't be doing this.

191
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,770
Do you know what I mean?

192
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,290
Joon.

193
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:36,190
Go get a good rest.

194
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,300
I'm okay.

195
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,680
Bye.

196
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:27,050
Oh, my. I must have dropped it here
on my way to throw it away.

197
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,910
Don't you have trash cans
in your neighborhood?

198
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,760
Why did you come all the way here
to dump it?

199
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:36,910
Well, I saw some jerk secretly dumping
a piece of clothing in my neighborhood,

200
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,200
and it turned out to be yours.

201
00:18:39,290 --> 00:18:40,910
I threw it away because I didn't need it.

202
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:44,790
You can wear it if you want.

203
00:18:46,110 --> 00:18:49,010
No, I want you to throw it away properly.

204
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:53,720
You wouldn't be so delighted
to see what you used to wear

205
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,400
end up just a trash
without being recycled, would you?

206
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:03,400
You know that I don't look back
once I abandon something.

207
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:07,800
And you love to pick up
things I throw away.

208
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,830
You little punk has grown up.

209
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:19,190
Then you shouldn't have cared about
what I picked up and has now become mine.

210
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,770
You shouldn't have acted like
you still owned it.

211
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,340
Oh, right.

212
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,520
I even picked up
this plush toy on the street.

213
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:40,840
I thought I would give it back
once I find the owner,

214
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,130
but the owner doesn't seem to show up.

215
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,160
I'll have to play with it.

216
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,410
Take a good rest.

217
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:54,880
And make sure to throw it away properly.

218
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,900
After you had left, Jae-joon came.

219
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:32,940
I shouldn't have talked to her.

220
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:35,440
Why? Did he see something?

221
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,090
Did he freak out?

222
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,550
I'm not sure,

223
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:48,340
but I think I might have put
In-hyung in a difficult situation.

224
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:50,890
From now on, just ignore her.

225
00:20:51,590 --> 00:20:55,860
Joon, it's all water under the bridge now.

226
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,340
What about you, Geun-young?

227
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:09,410
-I'd like to have a beer.
-Beer, okay.

228
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,830
Guys, look.

229
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,610
This place is called Peach Garden.

230
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:21,690
Just like Liu Bei, Guan Yu, and Zhang Fei
swore brotherhood in Peach Garden,

231
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:23,620
we're gathered here today to team up.

232
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:25,510
When I say, "We are", say, "one".

233
00:21:25,950 --> 00:21:27,050
We are...

234
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:29,120
Just do it. One.

235
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,350
-One.
-One.

236
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,290
One.

237
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,950
Now, we're on the same boat.

238
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,140
Shall we drink to it?

239
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,450
Shall we continue drinking then?

240
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,700
-Sounds great. Cheers.
-You must be a heavy drinker.

241
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,380
Why, thank you.

242
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:49,100
Cheers.

243
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:57,680
I have never lost money.

244
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:59,750
Seriously, I have collected all the debt.

245
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:00,980
-Really?
-Really.

246
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:03,000
-Shall we drink?
-Sounds great.

247
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:05,330
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

248
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:43,310
Okay.

249
00:22:44,270 --> 00:22:46,690
Shall we open another bottle?

250
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:48,230
Yes!

251
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,050
Do you even need to ask?

252
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:53,950
Okay, let's move to a different place
and continue the party.

253
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:57,250
♫ I say you are a jerk ♫

254
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,920
♫ You are so cocky and annoying ♫

255
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:01,650
♫ Lee Geun-young is ♫

256
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:03,370
♫ A confident woman ♫

257
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:05,740
♫ I keep checking my phone
My phone keeps ringing ♫

258
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:08,120
♫ I was with my friend Shy, shy, shy ♫

259
00:23:08,210 --> 00:23:13,090
♫ Cheer up, baby, cheer up, baby
Give it a little more ♫

260
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,810
It's finished!

261
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,840
Finally, it's finished.

262
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:22,110
As I said earlier,
I'm not so good with variety shows,

263
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,360
and it worries me.

264
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:29,460
These days, you don't need to be good
on variety shows.

265
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,140
You just need to be yourself.

266
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:35,970
She's right. Now that I drink with you,

267
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:38,300
-you seem more humane in reality.
-Right.

268
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:41,120
You're just saying that, aren't you?

269
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:42,480
No, I'm not.

270
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:46,310
Then what do you think, Ms. No?
You're a horrible liar.

271
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:50,320
Me? You know

272
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:53,790
how much I hate lying.

273
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:56,170
And you're a real deal.

274
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:01,490
I'm sure you'll take care of it,

275
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:07,830
but you'll let me take a peek
at the video before it's aired, right?

276
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,070
Of course. That's not a big deal.

277
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,740
I knew it. Let's drink.

278
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,860
-Okay.
-Cheers.

279
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:16,720
(I'm sure even if I leave this room
and go home right now,)

280
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,470
(no one would recognize it.)

281
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:23,230
(I'm not a big star like Who-joon)

282
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:28,240
(nor someone who has the say
in this show.)

283
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:29,520
Cheers.

284
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:32,690
(I'm just that punk's anti-fan.)

285
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:36,820
May I sing another song?

286
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:40,340
Today, the mic is yours, Geun-young.

287
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:44,650
♫ Please fill me with your love ♫

288
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:48,610
♫ I think I'm out of the battery of love ♫

289
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:52,880
♫ I cannot live without you ♫

290
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:55,430
♫ You are my battery ♫

291
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,160
♫ I think the drug of love has worn off ♫

292
00:24:58,250 --> 00:25:02,300
♫ The drug of love has worn off ♫

293
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:17,520
♫ How lonely have I been without you ♫

294
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:22,450
♫ Days have passed
And when I found out the truth about you ♫

295
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:24,520
♫ I will send all my love to you ♫

296
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:27,690
♫ I revolve around you ♫

297
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:30,150
♫ But you are not the sun♫

298
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,530
♫ But you become the center anyway ♫

299
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:35,430
♫ But you shouldn’t do whatever you want ♫

300
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,690
♫ You are always you, you, you, you ♫

301
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:40,930
♫ I'm always me, me, me, me ♫

302
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:46,430
♫ Shake it, you punk! Yo! ♫

303
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:03,940
Sorry.

304
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:07,150
Where was it?

305
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,460
Geun-young.

306
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:20,350
Hey.

307
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,210
What a funny coincidence.

308
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,290
Here. Have it.

309
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,680
I heard Who-joon was here.
Did you come with him?

310
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:36,370
Yes, we came together.

311
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:40,150
I heard you accepted the offer.
I read an article about it.

312
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,340
I did.

313
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:47,810
I was going to fight head-on, but...

314
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,570
He upset you again, didn't he?

315
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,920
You're wearing high heels today.

316
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,650
Why don't you lodge his head again
while you're drunk?

317
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,840
Oh.

318
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,140
I probably should have done that.

319
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,960
I told you

320
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:07,520
some people in this world
must be rooting for you.

321
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:10,030
And I'm probably
the most famous one among them.

322
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:16,450
What you just said
somehow really cheers me up.

323
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:21,640
This is why celebrities say
they can hold up thanks to their fans.

324
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:24,630
Wait. This is not good.

325
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:27,710
Are you already starting
to relate to celebrities?

326
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:29,960
No way.

327
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:32,730
I'll call a cab.

328
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,770
(-Is this your phone?)
-I did drink a lot, but I'm fine.

329
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,290
I'm not a child.

330
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:41,660
-Yes.
(-Here.)

331
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:43,250
I just got a celebrity's phone number.

332
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:45,970
(-Promise me you will save it.)
-Okay.

333
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,740
If you're drunk, you should go home.

334
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:57,020
What are you doing here?

335
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:59,350
Who is drunk?

336
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:03,130
I didn't think you had
the kind of relationship

337
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,250
where you worry
about each other like that.

338
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:10,000
Only the two involved would know
what kind of relationship they have.

339
00:28:13,030 --> 00:28:16,860
Geun-young,
the top star is being cranky again.

340
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:19,770
Oh, that's because he loves attention.

341
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,640
He seems to think
he's the center of the world, right?

342
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:25,970
He's such a jerk.

343
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:32,920
What's the matter? Do you want to know
what we're talking about?

344
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,570
Or are you worried?

345
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:40,890
Are you worried I might pick up
what you have thrown away?

346
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:44,140
Watch your mouth, Jae-joon.

347
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:49,200
Then don't look at me like that.

348
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:55,800
Geun-young, I'll see you later.

349
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:58,220
Sure. Thanks for the coffee.

350
00:28:58,310 --> 00:29:01,170
-You owe me.
-Of course. Good night.

351
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:04,470
Bye.

352
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:09,840
He's such a decent man.

353
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:12,430
What's your relationship with him?

354
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,370
I don't know.

355
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:19,210
I think that's our cab.

356
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:22,860
We really wanted to see our actors off,
but sadly, our cab is here.

357
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:25,760
I'm afraid we should get going now.

358
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:28,010
Bye.

359
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,120
-Hey.
-Hurry and get in.

360
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:36,680
All right. I'll get going now, superstar.

361
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:39,670
Hey, you're not going anywhere.
You're all wasted.

362
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,820
-Take a cab.
-I'm not drunk.

363
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:44,020
I don't want another scandal, okay?

364
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:47,810
-So take a cab.
-I can take the subway home.

365
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,790
-It's not so far away.
-You're being ridiculous.

366
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:51,940
I said I'm not drunk.

367
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:54,140
Just listen to me, okay?

368
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:56,120
-But I...
-Taxi!

369
00:29:56,210 --> 00:29:57,970
All right. I got a taxi.

370
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,860
Stop moving, okay?

371
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:03,430
I'm sorry,
but could you please wait a bit?

372
00:30:15,130 --> 00:30:17,860
Have I been wasting all the money
on the gym membership?

373
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,760
Is this because she's heavy or I'm weak?

374
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:25,030
Gosh.

375
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:29,390
Okay. We're almost there. Hang in there.

376
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:33,920
Promise me you won't throw up, okay?

377
00:30:34,890 --> 00:30:37,310
If you throw up, I'm going to...

378
00:30:40,870 --> 00:30:44,130
She's walking.
Oh, my gosh. She's been awake.

379
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:46,810
Gosh.

380
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:50,730
Hey, Lee Geun-young.

381
00:30:56,840 --> 00:31:00,270
You'd better wish
this doesn't affect my dance.

382
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:04,980
You... Let me ask you something.

383
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:10,260
How do you know Jae-joon?

384
00:31:13,610 --> 00:31:15,760
Why do you keep ignoring me?

385
00:31:19,990 --> 00:31:21,530
Darn it.

386
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:35,690
Don't get me wrong.

387
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:40,620
I'm doing this so you feel hot.

388
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:43,830
So you sweat like a pig.

389
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:55,670
♫ Please fill me with your love ♫

390
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:59,580
♫ I think I'm out of the battery of love ♫

391
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,540
Thank you.

392
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:07,330
She's sleeping so well.

393
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:11,240
Why would she put these inside the house?

394
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:47,060
You shouldn't have looked at me like that.

395
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:16,890
Promise me you won't throw up, okay?

396
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,520
I didn't go overboard, did I?

397
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:25,430
Did I?

398
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:40,030
-Hello.
(-Geun-young.)

399
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,360
-Who is this?
-It's me, JJ.

400
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:46,900
Did you get home safely last night?

401
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:48,260
Right.

402
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:53,150
Thanks for the coffee.

403
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:57,410
If you're free, would you like
to buy me the coffee you owe me?

404
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,880
Sure. I should.

405
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:01,900
Although,

406
00:34:03,930 --> 00:34:06,040
does it have to be coffee?

407
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:10,040
(Sang Restaurant)

408
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:26,630
-Hey.
-Hi.

409
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,699
-Did I keep you waiting for long?
-No, you didn't.

410
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:31,650
Is it okay to be in public places
like this? You're a celebrity.

411
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:34,510
Well, I'm a CEO now.

412
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:38,600
By the way, you can eat hangover soup?

413
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:40,360
Of course.

414
00:34:40,449 --> 00:34:41,989
I've been a reporter for three years,

415
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:44,489
and I wouldn't have survived
if it weren't for this restaurant.

416
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:47,050
After working all night long
or drinking all night long,

417
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:49,989
a bowl of this soup would cure everything.

418
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,810
Wait, do you not like hangover soup?

419
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:55,929
I do. I also drank a lot last night.

420
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,380
Why? What happened?

421
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:01,520
Well, I also have someone
who has been troubling me.

422
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:03,370
Someone I would like to hit
with a high heel.

423
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:04,600
You should have told me.

424
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:06,760
I should have indeed.

425
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:08,910
Here's your food.

426
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:13,400
-Enjoy.
-Thanks.

427
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:14,720
I'll show you how you eat this.

428
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,140
-Is that your recipe?
-Yes.

429
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,600
-Let's dig in.
-Okay.

430
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:35,180
Right, did you save my number?

431
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:36,320
Of course.

432
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:39,100
You didn't save me as "stranger", did you?

433
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:41,160
No way.

434
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,600
It's Jae-joon.

435
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,100
Choi Jae-joon.

436
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,830
You can now just call me by my name.

437
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:52,650
To be honest, JJ sounds a bit weird.

438
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:54,190
Right.

439
00:35:55,110 --> 00:35:57,930
Then I'll just call you
by your name, Jae-joon.

440
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,780
That sounds much better.

441
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:23,930
Hey.

442
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,390
Did you get involved
with Jae-joon, that punk?

443
00:36:29,870 --> 00:36:31,370
What are you saying, all of a sudden?

444
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:34,970
That punk suddenly called me
and said I should manage you better.

445
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,600
He said you should stay out of his girl

446
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:38,930
if you don't want to be
kicked out of this field for good.

447
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:42,670
He also said once that happens,
I would go broke.

448
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,890
You've become weak, Young-suk.

449
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:47,820
You get swayed by Jae-joon's words now.

450
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:51,690
This is why you should have supported
other guys too in case I fail.

451
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,320
I cannot sleep at night worrying about

452
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:55,790
what would happen to this company
if something happens to me.

453
00:36:55,870 --> 00:36:57,410
You're not the only sensitive one here.

454
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,750
I can't even sit on the toilet comfortably

455
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:02,650
worrying it might tarnish your image.

456
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:04,890
Mr. Bae, Joon's got a schedule.

457
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,080
Let's go.

458
00:37:09,290 --> 00:37:10,790
Hey, you...

459
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:13,170
Bye.

460
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,160
Mr. Bae,

461
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:18,930
are you constipated?

462
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:22,100
You just said you can't sit
on the toilet comfortably.

463
00:37:23,730 --> 00:37:24,910
I poop well.

464
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:56,200
Yes. Tomorrow is the first shoot,
but I have no idea what I'll be doing.

465
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:58,660
(Come over after the shoot.
Let's have a party.)

466
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:01,080
Okay. I'll call you when I'm done.

467
00:38:24,490 --> 00:38:26,860
Ms. No, Geun-young is here.

468
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:30,340
Oh, you're early.

469
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:33,110
As if you have been waiting around here.

470
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:36,190
We just decided to do the shoot
in the penthouse today.

471
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:38,960
(Ms. No)
We just decided to do the shoot
in the penthouse today.

472
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,010
You can get ready here, so dress casually.
(Ms. No)
We just decided to do the shoot
in the penthouse today.

473
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:41,740
You can get ready here, so dress casually.

474
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,760
I was just passing by.

475
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:45,080
By the way,

476
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:48,510
you dressed almost too casually.

477
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:51,110
Come on in.

478
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:55,600
The staff will be here in a minute,
so we need to hurry.

479
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,660
Great.

480
00:39:02,150 --> 00:39:06,640
Oh, my. Baby, you look gorgeous
with the makeup on.

481
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,590
As if.

482
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,310
Who are you?

483
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:00,890
You look so beautiful.

484
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:02,960
You look amazing.

485
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:12,420
Finally, you look good together.

486
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:15,320
This is a virtual marriage,

487
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:17,740
so we'll start with a wedding shoot.

488
00:40:17,830 --> 00:40:20,510
But before that,
Geun-young needs to get ready.

489
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,790
Wasn't it done?

490
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:24,300
Guys, get the things for Geun-young.

491
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:26,100
Hurry.

492
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:28,790
What's wrong? Is there a problem?

493
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,160
Raise that...

494
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:32,750
(So I Married the Anti-Fan)

495
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,960
All right. Bride, and Groom,
are you ready?

496
00:40:36,050 --> 00:40:37,850
-Yes.
-Groom, are you ready?

497
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:40,230
-Of course.
-All right. Let's go!

498
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:43,310
Make sure to look spiteful.

499
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:45,950
It hurts a bit. Could you
please move it a bit to this way?

500
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:47,660
-Like this.
-Okay.

501
00:40:49,290 --> 00:40:51,450
Very good. This is what I wanted.

502
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,570
-Shoot the gun of love.
-Shoot it in that direction.

503
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,850
Bang, bang, bang!

504
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:00,820
The bullets of love! Ouch!

505
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:03,900
Good. No, don't hold the gun.

506
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:12,120
-Wait.
-You should be shivering.

507
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:13,970
-Okay. Let's make this quick.
-Okay.

508
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:17,760
Move a bit. Good.

509
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,200
Very good. Now...

510
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,530
How about this?

511
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:27,170
-I get what you're going for.
-Right?

512
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:30,080
Did you think I was a pushover?

513
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:32,410
How about this?

514
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:35,140
-I love it!
-That's great! I love it!

515
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:37,600
-You're so good.
-Act like you want to kill each other.

516
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:38,790
Very good!

517
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:41,650
Thanks. It hurts.

518
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:43,760
This is exactly what I wanted.

519
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:55,110
This time, you will
go on a drive together.

520
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,870
And

521
00:41:57,310 --> 00:41:59,340
Geun-young will be the driver.

522
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:01,840
Are you sure Geun-young can handle it?

523
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:03,300
You have a driver's license, right?

524
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:05,190
What?

525
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:08,490
-I do, but--
-Okay.

526
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:11,570
Then let's start
as soon as the staff is ready.

527
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:14,820
Let's wrap this up
and shoot the driving scene.

528
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:16,010
Please get ready.

529
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:35,810
You'll be driving only 100m,
so don't worry.

530
00:42:36,870 --> 00:42:37,970
Geun-young?

531
00:42:39,150 --> 00:42:40,910
-Geun-young?
-Yes?

532
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,280
Are you okay?

533
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:44,830
If you're so concerned,
just tell the producer you can't...

534
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,950
It's okay. You said
I didn't have to drive a long way.

535
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,810
If I don't do this, you guys
have to think of something else.

536
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:52,130
I can do this.

537
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:54,770
You already sound like a pro.
You can do this.

538
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:55,960
-Thanks.
-Joon.

539
00:42:58,290 --> 00:43:01,330
A famous car racer said
that driving is done by instinct.

540
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:02,520
Gosh.

541
00:43:04,810 --> 00:43:06,300
-She's getting ready.
-Okay.

542
00:43:06,390 --> 00:43:09,070
-Good.
-Good luck.

543
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:11,320
You can do this.

544
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:15,720
Accelerator...

545
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,040
I guess you don't want to hurt yourself.

546
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,680
You're a human too, after all.

547
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:26,100
This is the most humane side of yours
I have ever seen.

548
00:43:28,830 --> 00:43:30,370
Could you please shut your mouth?

549
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:36,750
What do we do with the seat belts?

550
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:40,670
Guys, this is a simple photoshoot,

551
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:42,650
so let's go without the seat belts.

552
00:43:54,350 --> 00:43:56,070
(Now, look at the camera.)

553
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:01,870
-Shall we?
-Shoot.

554
00:44:02,310 --> 00:44:04,290
Let's start the shoot.

555
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:09,350
Three, two, one.

556
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,650
Now, shall we go, Geun-young?

557
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:36,370
(You're trying to look
like a gentleman, aren't you?)

558
00:44:38,350 --> 00:44:39,980
-I'll be a gentle driver.
-Okay.

559
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:41,160
You can do it.

560
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:04,970
I think the takeoff seems
a little more dynamic than I thought.

561
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:06,950
She's feisty. I like it.

562
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:09,760
Geun-young, wait.
I think you're going a little too fast.

563
00:45:09,850 --> 00:45:11,130
Wait. Stop the car.

564
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:14,690
Wait. Slow down!

565
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:17,160
-Step on the brake.
-What's going on?

566
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:19,000
-Wait. Stop.
-My goodness.

567
00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:20,590
-Stop the car!
-How do I stop the car?

568
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:22,790
-Stop! Step on the brake!
-I am stepping on the brake.

569
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:23,890
That's the accelerator!

570
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:24,990
-Oh, my gosh!
-Oh, no!

571
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:27,800
Stop the car! We're going to hit them!

572
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:29,920
-What do I do?
-Stop! Stop the car!

573
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,780
-Stop the car!
-Wait!

574
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:34,090
Hit the brake!

575
00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:17,260
Cut.

576
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:19,720
Oh.

577
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:34,330
Are you okay? Did you get hurt?

578
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:37,850
I'm sorry.
I confused the accelerator with the brake.

579
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:39,520
-Shut it.
-But...

580
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:42,780
-I mean I didn't mean to...
-I said, shut it.

581
00:46:43,570 --> 00:46:45,420
Who-joon, are you okay?

582
00:46:45,770 --> 00:46:48,190
-Geun-young, are you okay?
-Are you okay?

583
00:46:48,850 --> 00:46:52,810
You managed to hit the brake anyway.

584
00:47:00,770 --> 00:47:02,580
Geun-young, you must be startled.

585
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:06,670
Never let this person drive a car.

586
00:47:09,090 --> 00:47:10,940
This is why I wanted to put
the seat belt on.

587
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:13,660
Don't you know they always say
seat belt saves our lives?

588
00:47:13,970 --> 00:47:15,380
-Calm down.
-Gosh.

589
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:18,680
-Joon...
-Actually,

590
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:22,110
I haven't driven a car before.

591
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:24,180
-I was going to say it, but...
-I see.

592
00:47:24,270 --> 00:47:27,220
You did a wonderful job then.

593
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:29,370
She did indeed.

594
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:33,600
After 13 years, we almost killed
people instead of doves this time.

595
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,180
They are alive, though.

596
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:41,780
-Geun-young, get off the car.
-Okay.

597
00:47:41,870 --> 00:47:43,800
Let's take the car out and wrap this up.

598
00:47:43,890 --> 00:47:45,610
Let's wrap it up here.

599
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,100
Oh, no.

600
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:50,050
Are you okay?

601
00:47:52,250 --> 00:47:53,660
Gosh.

602
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,700
That woman sure has a talent
for surprising people.

603
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:59,160
Kang-yeon, check if he got his face hurt.

604
00:47:59,250 --> 00:48:00,350
Okay.

605
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:10,420
What's wrong?

606
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:13,150
He didn't get hurt.

607
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,240
Joon, have some water.

608
00:48:22,700 --> 00:48:25,690
I'm sorry, but could you give us a minute?

609
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:27,500
Let's go.

610
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:31,810
You must be surprised.

611
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:34,400
You didn't see it, did you?

612
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:36,820
See what?

613
00:48:38,270 --> 00:48:39,860
Never mind. I'm glad you didn't see it.

614
00:48:42,150 --> 00:48:44,700
There were three.

615
00:48:45,620 --> 00:48:46,810
And...

616
00:48:47,910 --> 00:48:49,800
Joon.

617
00:48:49,890 --> 00:48:51,740
-What?
-Are you okay?

618
00:48:51,830 --> 00:48:54,420
No, I'm not okay.

619
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,630
Like this.

620
00:48:57,720 --> 00:48:59,090
Number one and number three.

621
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:02,300
100 percent.

622
00:49:02,390 --> 00:49:04,850
Gosh, you must have been really shocked.

623
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:11,010
It was just an accident. A car accident.

624
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:24,740
It was a minor collision.

625
00:49:33,410 --> 00:49:35,120
But why did it have to be him?

626
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:43,390
Geun-young, are you okay?

627
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:44,580
Yes.

628
00:49:45,510 --> 00:49:47,310
Is there something on your lips?

629
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:48,940
Or are you just washing your face?

630
00:49:53,070 --> 00:49:54,750
Gosh, this is so refreshing.

631
00:49:57,910 --> 00:49:59,670
What an interesting way to wash the face.

632
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:14,980
Hey, Geun-young.
Could you have a seat here for a second?

633
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:27,700
There had been a tiny accident,

634
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:31,350
but I think we got some nice cuts
thanks to that.

635
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:34,870
Let's call it a day.

636
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,420
Geun-young, I want you to stay
for an interview.

637
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:38,830
Okay.

638
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:40,280
Good work, guys.

639
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,240
-Good work.
-What are you doing?

640
00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:46,620
-Great work, guys.
-Let's go.

641
00:50:49,170 --> 00:50:51,590
-I'm sorry about earlier.
-Why didn't you say you can't drive?

642
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:53,220
Did you want to kill me?

643
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,770
You're not the only one
who could've been hurt.

644
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:57,660
I could've been hurt too.
I was surprised too.

645
00:50:57,750 --> 00:50:59,510
I'm the one who was surprised.

646
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:02,330
Of course, I was surprised.
I didn't know we would kiss...

647
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:06,900
Keep your mouth shut.

648
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:10,560
Don't use this as an opportunity
to feather your own nest.

649
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:13,240
Pervert.

650
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:25,430
What do I do with that punk?

651
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:35,240
Are you nervous?

652
00:51:35,770 --> 00:51:37,400
-What?
-Loosen up.

653
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:41,000
-It's just an interview. Relax.
-Okay.

654
00:51:41,090 --> 00:51:43,860
How did you feel
when you first got the offer?

655
00:51:43,950 --> 00:51:45,450
You felt uncomfortable, right?

656
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:46,020
(So I Married the Anti-Fan)

657
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:47,470
I did, of course.
(So I Married the Anti-Fan)

658
00:51:47,470 --> 00:51:48,260
(So I Married the Anti-Fan)

659
00:51:48,260 --> 00:51:49,360
It's true
(So I Married the Anti-Fan)

660
00:51:50,510 --> 00:51:56,180
that Who-joon and I created some stir.

661
00:51:56,450 --> 00:51:57,020
(So I Married the Anti-Fan)

662
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:59,440
Then what made you decide
to accept the offer?
(So I Married the Anti-Fan)

663
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:02,080
How can I put it?

664
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:09,870
It felt like procrastinating a homework.

665
00:52:09,950 --> 00:52:13,300
It felt like procrastinating a homework,
and it made me feel uncomfortable.

666
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:16,690
Then how was the first shoot today?

667
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:18,580
Well.

668
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:21,920
Uncomfortable?

669
00:52:24,560 --> 00:52:27,380
Will the accident today be aired too?

670
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:31,340
I don't think it should.

671
00:52:31,950 --> 00:52:33,050
Will it be?

672
00:52:58,440 --> 00:52:59,850
What's this smell?

673
00:53:06,010 --> 00:53:08,470
This is why they said
shooting shows make your feet stink.

674
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:11,510
This is just unbelievable.

675
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:28,890
It's great to have a sauna at home.

676
00:54:09,410 --> 00:54:10,510
I love this.

677
00:54:12,890 --> 00:54:13,990
It's so refreshing.

678
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:20,630
Gosh, this is amazing.

679
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:29,080
Let's see.

680
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:31,590
Oh, no one has contacted me.

681
00:54:36,250 --> 00:54:39,990
I know I made a mistake,

682
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:42,280
but how could that punk talk like that?

683
00:54:42,410 --> 00:54:44,610
Feather my own nest? Pervert?

684
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:47,690
I would never be interested
in a man like you,

685
00:54:47,780 --> 00:54:49,320
you lynx-looking punk.

686
00:54:49,410 --> 00:54:51,610
Why do they say he has a good personality?

687
00:54:54,950 --> 00:54:56,050
All right.

688
00:54:56,180 --> 00:55:01,370
I will show them how two-faced you are.

689
00:55:01,950 --> 00:55:04,450
You are going to be surprised
when you see this.

690
00:55:04,630 --> 00:55:04,720
Who-joon's two faces.

691
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,790
(Who-joon's two faces)
Who-joon's two faces.

692
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:08,810
There are so many things to write about,

693
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:10,660
but number one.

694
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:14,220
When he gets angry, he rudely tells others

695
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,950
to shut their mouths.

696
00:55:17,830 --> 00:55:18,930
And it's really offensive.

697
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:21,260
Those who haven't experienced this
would never understand.

698
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:29,010
Who-joon, I heard you got hurt.
How and how much did you get hurt?

699
00:55:29,090 --> 00:55:30,370
Who's the producer?

700
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:32,090
Why did they even take you out?

701
00:55:32,170 --> 00:55:34,290
I let them use your place as the set.

702
00:55:34,370 --> 00:55:36,090
Why did you make me do it
in the first place?

703
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:39,650
It's all for the best. You think
I would do something that would harm you?

704
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:42,650
Of course, it's for the best,
but for whom?

705
00:55:42,730 --> 00:55:46,250
Speaking of which, I had changed
the owner of the house.

706
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:48,630
When this shoot is over,
the house will be yours.

707
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:50,700
What are you trying to pull here?

708
00:55:50,790 --> 00:55:53,250
Are you doing this
in case I get in trouble?

709
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:55,230
This time, it's for real.

710
00:55:56,070 --> 00:55:58,530
Gosh, I probably should
change the producer.

711
00:55:58,620 --> 00:56:01,790
Don't bother.
It was just a minor collision.

712
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:04,730
Is that so? Then after the meeting,

713
00:56:04,820 --> 00:56:07,200
make sure to sign the contract, okay?

714
00:56:07,290 --> 00:56:08,390
Okay?

715
00:56:13,050 --> 00:56:15,380
Gosh, I hate this.
I should be a singer myself.

716
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:18,500
-Hey, you're here.
-Hi.

717
00:56:18,590 --> 00:56:20,350
Hi, Who-joon.

718
00:56:20,440 --> 00:56:23,300
This is the director of the movie,
Choi Hwa-jin.

719
00:56:23,390 --> 00:56:26,160
-Nice to meet you, sir.
-Nice to meet you.

720
00:56:26,250 --> 00:56:27,350
Please have a seat.

721
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:33,420
He seems like a nice person.

722
00:56:34,610 --> 00:56:36,240
It's all for his image.

723
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:38,480
(I saw him hitting a woman's head
and the woman crying.)
It's all for his image.

724
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:43,190
Otherwise, he's frowning all the time.

725
00:56:46,090 --> 00:56:47,190
Number three.

726
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:54,190
-What?
(-You don't know the passcode?)

727
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:56,390
Oh, no.

728
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:00,300
Because of the security,
but Director Han is on his way.

729
00:57:00,390 --> 00:57:02,900
I told you we should've
checked before we leave.

730
00:57:02,990 --> 00:57:05,500
(-Could you hold this for a second?
-Okay.)

731
00:57:17,290 --> 00:57:19,140
Let's get in.

732
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:23,890
All right. Let's see.

733
00:57:24,590 --> 00:57:25,820
About the camera setting,

734
00:57:25,910 --> 00:57:29,560
let's set some up to cover
the living room and the kitchen.

735
00:57:29,650 --> 00:57:30,970
-Okay.
-I'm sorry.

736
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:32,690
Well, it's always good to double-check it.

737
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:34,010
-I'll go check.
-Okay.

738
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:40,870
Director Han, how about we put
a camera on the balcony?

739
00:57:41,270 --> 00:57:45,620
That sounds great.
Let's put some on the balcony.

740
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:48,660
Then... What?

741
00:57:49,190 --> 00:57:51,830
I said you should keep the doors closed.

742
00:57:52,570 --> 00:57:54,510
-Jong-geon!
-Yes?

743
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:58,160
You forgot to lock this door.

744
00:57:58,250 --> 00:58:00,360
You almost got us in trouble.

745
00:58:00,450 --> 00:58:01,900
-Are they all closed now?
-Yes.

746
00:58:03,270 --> 00:58:04,590
Good.

747
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:06,080
Now, let's go.

748
00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:09,510
You made us work twice today,
so why don't you buy us a meal?

749
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:10,790
-A meal?
-Not just a meal.

750
00:58:11,320 --> 00:58:13,610
-I want beef.
-Thanks in advance.

751
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:20,340
Wait.

752
00:58:30,630 --> 00:58:31,730
Did they lock them all?

753
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:34,070
Did they really lock them?

754
00:58:34,330 --> 00:58:37,720
Why would they lock these? Who would
break into a balcony on the 25th floor?

755
00:58:42,730 --> 00:58:43,830
Oh, my.

756
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:48,150
What do I do?

757
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:55,540
Who should I call?

758
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:58,000
911?

759
00:59:01,650 --> 00:59:04,070
But promise me not to let anyone know
that you're here.

760
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:10,100
Mi-jung.

761
00:59:10,190 --> 00:59:11,550
(Mi-jung)

762
00:59:13,670 --> 00:59:17,010
Are you sure
you're going to your senior's place?

763
00:59:23,170 --> 00:59:25,540
Will that punk drop by again today?

764
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:35,930
I want to use the bathroom.

765
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:50,180
Right. His manager told me
I should call him when something's up.

766
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:53,400
And this is definitely something.

767
00:59:57,180 --> 00:59:58,760
Well, don't mind about me

768
00:59:58,850 --> 01:00:01,100
and do whatever you want...

769
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:04,880
He's taking a quite long bathroom break.

770
01:00:06,290 --> 01:00:07,870
(Lee Geun-young)

771
01:00:10,030 --> 01:00:12,100
It must be an important call.

772
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:15,840
If it's not too much trouble,
could I go answer this?

773
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:17,240
Sure. Go ahead.

774
01:00:17,330 --> 01:00:18,430
Thanks.

775
01:00:23,490 --> 01:00:26,350
(Can you please help me?)

776
01:00:55,570 --> 01:00:55,680
(You'd better leave him alone.)
