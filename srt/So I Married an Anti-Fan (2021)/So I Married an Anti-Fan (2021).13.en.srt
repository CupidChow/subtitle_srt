she didn't have an agency?

That probably made Jae-joon angrier.

I'm sure Mr. Bae was flustered too.

67

69
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:16,060
Yes. Because I left you there.

70
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,270
Why? Did you melt
because that was too sweet?

Did you look into the ring again?

77

I asked around,
but it's not easy to find any information.

78
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,740
But there was someone
who had a photo among his friends,

79
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,720
so I decided to take that.

then go back and wait.

160
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:19,970
Anyway, about Oh In-hyung,
the girl who went out on that audition.

161
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:22,220
Mind your own.
I told them to only let rookies in,

162
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,020
but the director wouldn't listen.

163
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:27,190
Do you think I came here
without knowing the entire story?

164
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:31,150
That troublesome old rookie is
finally getting her break,

165
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:34,490
but how dare you let her say
she'll cancel the contract?

166
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,280
Darn it, my neck hurts.

167
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,930
You were the one who told me to drop her.

168
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,450
Her value went up.

169
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:49,100
And that TV director
gave her a break at once,

170
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:51,300
something you couldn't do over six years.

171
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:54,510
Do I have to step in to sign a contract
with this nobody?

172
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,690
This is nobody's business,
so don't do anything and mind your own.

173
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,230
I'll manage.

174
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:05,340
Do you realize that no one in this family
expects you to manage anything smoothly?

175
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:09,030
This will be your last chance.

176
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:16,030
And lastly,
let me give you a piece of advice.

177
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:19,550
You can't afford
to cut anybody's slack right now.

178
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:31,430
That jerk.

179
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:58,750
(Group Chat: 3 people)

180
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,730

for chicken today?)
(Group Chat: 3 people)

181

(Group Chat: 3 people)

182
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:01,920
I'm all for it.
(Group Chat: 3 people)

183
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:12,040
(What are you up to?)

184
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:15,250
(Mr. Joon: What are you doing?
You won't even text me.)

185
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:18,510
Hey, what do you think
about the rhythm here?

186
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:19,870
I like it.

187
00:14:19,870 --> 00:14:20,710
(Just Lee Geun-young:
I thought you'd be busy.)
I like it.

188
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:21,190
(Just Lee Geun-young:
I thought you'd be busy.)

189
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:22,030
You like this? The beat is off right here.
(Just Lee Geun-young:
I thought you'd be busy.)

You like this? The beat is off right here.

191

(I can stay in touch with you
no matter how busy I am.)
You like this? The beat is off right here.

192

(I can stay in touch with you
no matter how busy I am.)

193
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,330
(Mr. Joon:
But I think I'll be late today.)

194
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:32,190
(You aren't the only one who's busy.
I have plans too.)

195
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:32,280
What are you doing?
(You aren't the only one who's busy.
I have plans too.)

196
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,290
What are you doing?

197
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:35,230
Hey, one second.

198
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,760
Hello?

199
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:42,790
Wait, where are you going?

200
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,360
(My gosh, this guy seems
more obsessed than I thought.)

201
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:47,900
(Did you call me to ask that?)

202
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:50,230
My gosh, this woman is
much of a player than I thought.

203
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:50,410
Then you weren't going to tell me
who you'll be with?

204
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:53,000
(Shooting Star Entertainment Company)
Then you weren't going to tell me
who you'll be with?

205
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:53,050
I'm meeting everyone at the chicken place
where Mi-jung works at. Are we good?
(Shooting Star Entertainment Company)
Then you weren't going to tell me
who you'll be with?

206
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:56,830
I'm meeting everyone at the chicken place
where Mi-jung works at. Are we good?

207
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:00,880
Really? It'd be great if I could come.

208
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,210
(But the recording will take a while.)

209
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,760
Next time. We can go together next time.

210
00:15:05,850 --> 00:15:09,540
Okay. Don't drink too much, okay?

211
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:11,080
And don't go home too late.

212
00:15:11,170 --> 00:15:12,840
And don't smile so much
in front of others.

213
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:15,880
Goodness, I thought you were
unbelievably busy today.

214
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:18,170
Stop nagging at me and get back to work.

215
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:21,860
Gosh, this is so unfair.
I was just worried. It wasn't nagging.

216
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,140
(You make me sad.)

217
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,940
Joon, get back inside.

218
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:28,900
I'll call you later.

219
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:57,500
(Ms. Lee Geun-young)

220
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:06,960
(The person you have reached
is not available. Transferring to...)

221
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:13,780
Ms. Lee, there's no way
you two can avoid me and be happy.

222
00:16:14,530 --> 00:16:16,780
You're now taking his side too?

223
00:16:21,310 --> 00:16:23,820
It's really hard
to see Geun-young these days.

224
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:26,100
It's as if she's a celebrity.

225
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,730
I wouldn't call her that.

226
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:31,160
But are you dating someone?

227
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:34,460
What? Hey, I don't have time for that.

228
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,150
What brings Shin-hyuk here at this hour?

229
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:39,390
Hey, Shin-hyuk.

230
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:44,450
Did your study group end already?

231
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:47,220
Yes, it was a very tough day.

232
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:51,580
Geun-young, is Who-joon busy?

233
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,820
Yes, I'm sure.

234
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:57,300
What would she know?
They're just on the show together.

235
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:01,260
A celebrity like him
lives a different life from us.

236
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:02,670
Isn't that so, Geun-young?

237
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:07,109
Come on. He lives such an awesome life.

238
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:08,430
He only seemed cool.

239
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:11,380
Right, isn't "So I Married the Anti-Fan"
on air today?

240
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:13,839
What? Don't turn it on.

241
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:15,290
Let's watch it.

242
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,700
It's embarrassing.

243
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,829
Is that when you went to Japan?

244
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,200
(Looking cool in an ad shooting!)

245
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,550
(Perfect chemistry with the model)

246
00:17:31,490 --> 00:17:34,430
Did you go to Japan
because of his TV ad shoot?

247
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:36,590
This and that.

248
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:40,590
Isn't that model the same girl
who got her break in the audition show?

249
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,760
Why couldn't she make it before?
She's so pretty.

250
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:47,720
You probably saw her in real life.
So? Is she pretty?

251
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:50,800
Yes, she's pretty.
She looks the same in real life.

252
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,200
(Who-joon's sweet and cute moment!)

253
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,180
If she was there as his partner,
I guess they're really close.
(Who-joon's sweet and cute moment!)

254
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,810
If she was there as his partner,
I guess they're really close.

255
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,570
They used to be in the same agency.

256
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:59,380
The same agency? Who is she anyway?

257
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:03,030
Her name is Oh In-hyung,
a singer signed with JJ's agency.

258
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,850
She debuted as a member of Florence
six years ago, but failed.

259
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:07,610
She recently went on an audition,

260
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:11,970
where her history of practicing
with Who-joon as a trainee came out,

261
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,170
which drew many people's attention.

262
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,260
Shin-hyuk, that was amazing.

263
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,590
When did you memorize all that?

264
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:23,670
Why can't you use your good memory
when you take your exams?

265
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,860
Goodness.

266
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,830
Mi-jung, while we're on the subject,

267
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:33,440
-should I try to be an entertainer?
-What now?

268
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,380
I think I have the potential
to be an entertainer.

269
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:37,750
The potential?

270
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,720
Baby, forget the potential.

271
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:44,880
Why don't you gain some credentials?

272
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,650
-Hey, credentials sound great.
-It sounds great.

273
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:50,460
Yes, let's make a toast
for his credentials.

274
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:51,960
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

275
00:18:52,050 --> 00:18:55,260
I don't want to work hard
and study for some exam all the time.

276
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:57,060
I want to live a cool life like Who-joon.

277
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:00,060
Sweetie, that's enough.
Stop joking around in front of my friends.

278
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,950
I'm not joking.
Why would I joke about this?

279
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,600
Then what? What about
all the time I invested in you?

280
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,720
"Invested"?

281
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:13,430
-Invested.
-No, I...

282
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,630
I'm sorry. I should probably go.

283
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:19,550
Wait, I...

284
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,800
(Perfect chemistry with the model)

285
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,440
(Who-joon's sweet and cute moment!)

286
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:47,620
In-hyung, you're putting on wings
called Who-joon to fly up?

287
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:51,050
(CEO Bae Young-suk)

288
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,210
And there was another guy
who couldn't stand to see that.

289
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:02,310
You must be extremely worried, Mr. Bae.

290
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,120
(What the heck are you getting at?)

291
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:08,080
Wait, you didn't know
about the TV ad either?

292
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:12,350
It's not like
I'm happy about this, Mr. Bae.

293
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:15,690
I think it might do you better
if you heard me out first.

294
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:20,490
If you think I'm trying to pull something,
I'll just do things my way.

295
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:25,720
Shin-hyuk was serious,
so we shouldn't have taken it as a joke.

296
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,730
Well, it'd be great
to live as a prosecutor's girlfriend,

297
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:33,380
but a star's girlfriend sounds good too.
Doesn't it, Geun-young?

298
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:37,070
What? Me? I wouldn't know.

299
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:43,320
You should probably call him.
Look at the time...

300
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:44,420
(You're drinking a lot again, aren't you?
Time to go home.)

301
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:46,140
(Mr. Joon)
(You're drinking a lot again, aren't you?
Time to go home.)

302
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,540
(I'll be outside.)

303
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,090
Look at the time.

304
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,280
You're leaving already?

305
00:20:58,370 --> 00:20:59,910
It's way too late.

306
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,730
I guess it's pretty tough
to live with your senior.

307
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:07,300
It's not that.
I forgot that I have a shooting tomorrow.

308
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:10,600
Okay. You should go. It's late.

309
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,580
I'll get going.

310
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:14,910
Work things out with Shin-hyuk.

311
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,820
Okay. Should I grab a cab for you?

312
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:20,680
No, I can catch one out there.

313
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,230
-Stay. It's cold.
-Bye.

314
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,420
Bye.

315
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:47,560
You aren't too drunk.

316
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:49,670
When did you get here?
Did I keep you waiting?

317
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,310
Is your day over? You didn't have to come.

318
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,630
Did you eat anything?

319
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:56,270
How did you keep
all these questions to yourself all day?

320
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,750
How can I not come
if you were out drinking at night?

321
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:02,610
There are lots of people here.
What if someone sees you?

322
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:05,200
Tell them to look. Let's go.

323
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:06,390
Okay.

324
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,400
So? Did you have fun
hanging out with your friends without me?

325
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,420
I thought you'd drink a lot.

326
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,320
Right, remember Shin-hyuk?
Mi-jung's boyfriend.

327
00:22:15,630 --> 00:22:19,280
He suddenly said he wants to be
an entertainer, so they got into a fight.

328
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:21,880
What? He said
he wants to be my lawyer before.

329
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:24,920
Exactly, that's what everyone thought,

330
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,220
but he suddenly said he wants to be
an entertainer, so Mi-jung blew up.

331
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,940
Wait, is that something to be angry about?

332
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,190
What's so bad about entertainers?

333
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:38,950
But someone with Shin-hyuk's looks
couldn't be an entertainer...

334
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:43,220
Well, you never know what will happen.
He might become a big star.

335
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,980
You never know what will happen.

336
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:49,160
Who knew we'd be in this relationship?

337
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:52,860
What's our relationship?

338
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:54,970
What?

339
00:22:56,770 --> 00:22:59,280
Well, you know.

340
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:03,060
Two people who sit together
in the night and stuff.

341
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,480
There are so many stars.

342
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,170
There are.

343
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,840
So? Do you want me to get you one?

344
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:17,450
-Gosh, that's awful.
-People in this relationship go,

345
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:19,030
"I'll get you a star!"

346
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,670
My gosh, I hate it.
Cut it out. That's so cheesy.

347
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:27,660
But whenever I look up
and see stars that sparkle,

348
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:31,050
there's someone I'm always reminded of.

349
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:38,610
What? You aren't staring at me
because you didn't get who it is, right?

350
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,330
Who is it? Who's this jerk?

351
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:45,740
Did you want to be like those stars
that shine brightly?

352
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:54,720
I wouldn't say I wanted to shine.

353
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,460
I had to.

354
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:02,900
I took the opportunity
that could've gone to someone else.

355
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,950
I think I made one too many mistakes

356
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:10,510
trying to shine brightly like the stars.

357
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:11,880
Have you heard?

358
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:17,330
You have to make up at least seven lies
in order to make one lie work.

359
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:21,340
Once I started lying,
it just never stopped.

360
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:25,030
A guy who studied in America.
A guy born from an affluent family.

361
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:27,190
And my birthday also became December 31st,

362
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,430
to make it seem like
it's a fate for me to win awards.

363
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,010
Did I ever tell you my birthday was faked?

364
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:38,230
My real birthday is February 27th. 0227.

365
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,010
That's the passcode to the penthouse.

366
00:24:41,090 --> 00:24:44,750
You're right.
I put it there in case I forget.

367
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:48,400
In case I lose touch with who I really am.

368
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:51,430
But that's not important.

369
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:54,950
The truth is, I'm a hillbilly from Alaska

370
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,800
who doesn't know who my dad is.

371
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:59,750
Are you still looking for him?

372
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,770
All I know about him is

373
00:25:03,090 --> 00:25:05,380
that ring you found for me last time.

374
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:09,030
Ji-hyang said he'll visit the group
who made that ring.

375
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,940
Then you might find him.

376
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,700
Maybe.

377
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:18,840
But I'm kind of scared too.

378
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:23,160
What if I fail to protect him,
just as I failed with Mom and In-hyung?

379
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,050
Don't be afraid.

380
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:34,420
I'm sure your mother knows
you didn't give up on protecting her.

381
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,360
And In-hyung too.

382
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:48,460
That's why I now have someone
I truly want to protect.

383
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,080
Are you staring because you don't know?

384
00:25:56,730 --> 00:26:00,690
Anyway, I had a question.
Why do you like me?

385
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:03,810
I gave that a thought.

386
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,570
When you're here with me,

387
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,900
I don't feel anxious at all.
I'm completely in peace.

388
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,820
I'm kidding.
How can you like someone for a reason?

389
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,590
I just like you.

390
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:43,280
Goodness, it has been so long.

391
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:46,310
You must've been in a hurry, Mr. Bae.

392
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,430
You're still the same.

393
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:57,230
What are you trying to pull?

394
00:26:58,150 --> 00:27:01,320
I'm not pulling anything.
Didn't I say I have an offer?

395
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,520
I know you.

396
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:07,430
Stop trying to deceive me,
and say what you have to say, kid.

397
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:10,250
"Kid"?

398
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:13,070
You kicked me out saying
I'm not one of yours.

399
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:14,250
What?

400
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,520
Hey, you're the one
who didn't want to stay home.

401
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:20,280
You're the one who felt belittled and left

402
00:27:20,370 --> 00:27:22,610
when Joon started to get his break.

403
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:27,370
You need to wake up too.

404
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:30,050
Don't let that big boy Joon fool you,

405
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:33,170
making you go around
cleaning up after his mess.

406
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,920
You don't like
how he's still clinging onto his history.

407
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:50,330
Don't you simply want him
to do as you say and bring in money?

408
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:53,150
Think about it.

409
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:56,850
How many people do you think know

410
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:59,660
about Joon and In-hyung's history
in this industry?

411
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:03,580
It's just you and me.

412
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:07,450
So? Are you going to expose that or what?

413
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:14,230
You thought I was that simple
after years of working in this field?

414
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,340
Hear me out.

415
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:21,530
What will you and I get
from exposing their relationship?

416
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:26,980
If it gets out, it'll only drop the value
on Joon and In-hyung's reputation.

417
00:28:29,670 --> 00:28:31,030
Let's merge our agencies.

418
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,940
Once they belong in the same agency,

419
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,620
all the rumors surrounding them
will come to a halt,

420
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,080
and you can keep my mouth shut too.

421
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:47,800
Man, you crazy kid.
Is this the so-called "offer"?

422
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:53,520
And do you think Joon's ancient history
could bring damage in any way?

423
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,600
Stop being petty over the love life
he had before his debut

424
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,280
and save yourself from the humiliation.

425
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:01,880
Make sure you keep In-hyung under control.

426
00:29:07,950 --> 00:29:09,050
Bye.

427
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:11,340
Mr. Bae, you shouldn't talk like that.

428
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,680
Why do you think
that's the only information I have?

429
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:31,530
All right, we're here.

430
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:34,080
-Get a good rest.
-Thanks.

431
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,870
And about this house.

432
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,720
I'm going to move out.

433
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:43,680
I was in a tight situation at first,
but I got paid by the show too.

434
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,100
-Wait, you can't.
-What?

435
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:48,430
You can't.
You'll make me anxious. Just stay.

436
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:51,730
Why would that make you anxious?
I feel more anxious to stay here.

437
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:53,530
I'll just shop for a place for now.

438
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:56,740
No, stop getting a weird idea,
and see you tomorrow on set.

439
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:58,150
You're staying, okay?

440
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:01,010
I'll think about it.

441
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:03,080
Drive safely.

442
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:07,700
No, don't get off.
I'm scared you might run into someone.

443
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:08,890
Bye.

444
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:12,270
Get a good rest.

445
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:33,130
Why did he come back?

446
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,810
You did your laundry.

447
00:30:56,230 --> 00:31:01,110
Well, I didn't want you
to take this the wrong way.

448
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:04,190
I had some circumstances,
so I asked him to let me stay.

449
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:08,110
Do you remember what I asked of you
when I ran into you at the office?

450
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,370
I asked you to take caution
and make sure you don't cause him damage.

451
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:14,140
Yes, so

452
00:31:15,110 --> 00:31:18,850
do you think I caused him any damage?

453
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:22,320
I understand that
a young man could date someone.

454
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:27,950
But if he's a big celebrity,
that isn't always the case.

455
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:33,500
Even the most insignificant relationship
could cause him big damage.

456
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:35,390
Insignificant.

457
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:40,180
You're being a bit too harsh.

458
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:41,370
Am I?

459
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,010
If I can be harsher, I'll do that.

460
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:48,900
Then what did you think it'd be like
to date a top star?

461
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,450
Do you want to see Joon crash down

462
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:53,600
at once?

463
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:57,480
Well, Joon is like that.

464
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,940
He can't stand to see someone
who's troubled,

465
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,400
just as he did for In-hyung.

466
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,650
Let me give you a piece of advice.

467
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:08,170
Why don't you date someone in your league?

468
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:16,920
I'll give you the benefit of doubt
and consider everything you said

469
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:21,100
as your concern about Who-joon.

470
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:25,990
You've known him much longer than I did,
but you trust him way less than I do.

471
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:31,270
Don't you think we're the ones
who can choose what this relationship is?

472
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,890
Do you think you two have
any choice in this?

473
00:32:36,590 --> 00:32:38,260
Okay, fine.

474
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:42,490
Let's say Joon chooses you
and gives up on everything.

475
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:44,860
Do you think you two will be happy?

476
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:48,160
What about Joon? The public will
turn their back on him at once.

477
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:50,450
He'll have to deal with that,

478
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:54,370
and can you deal with him
when he's in that spot?

479
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:06,820
It seems like you know more about him now,

480
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:12,630
so I'll trust that you will make
the wisest decision and leave.

481
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:15,790
If I were you, I'd move out
as soon as tomorrow's shooting is over.

482
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:18,960
Do you know how dangerous it is
for you to live here?

483
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:20,810
Let me know if you need to find a place.

484
00:33:21,650 --> 00:33:22,750
Goodbye.

485
00:33:56,850 --> 00:33:58,080
My gosh.

486
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:00,630
Why are you sitting there like that?

487
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,900
What about you?
The studio said you left ages ago.

488
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:07,760
Don't be so worried. I went for a drive.

489
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:13,790
What is it?

490
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:17,389
Is something going on?

491
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:22,100
Joon, about that ring.

492
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:25,710
I went to the meeting,
but no one was in touch with him.

493
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:29,190
After they graduated,
they heard he was getting married.

494
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:31,739
Then they lost touch with him
once he moved abroad.

495
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,460
Do you think that was my mom?

496
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:43,000
That could be the case.
So I'm going to ask around a bit more.

497
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:46,699
I'm sure he had a close friend
among his alumni.

498
00:34:47,449 --> 00:34:48,550
And right.

499
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:54,310
I got an old photo of him from them.

500
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:07,510
Right.

501
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,520
I was going to move out anyway.

502
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:15,870
I'll move out right away
as soon as tomorrow's shooting is over.

503
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:20,710
(Balance: 23,121,544 won)

504
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:21,900
With my severance pay
and the pay from the show,
(Balance: 23,121,544 won)

505
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:22,860
With my severance pay
and the pay from the show,

506
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,940
I could probably find a studio, right?

507
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:31,800
(For lease)

508
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:39,190
(Mr. Joon)

509
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:41,700
I'll trust that you will make

510
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:45,040
the wisest decision and leave.

511
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:48,820
(Mr. Joon)

512
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:49,920
Okay.

513
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:52,520
Later.

514
00:35:53,310 --> 00:35:55,120
I'll tell him later.

515
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:45,580
This is the last time I sit out here.

516
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:50,860
I won't have to hide anymore,
so it's for the better.

517
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:57,420
Goodbye, be well.

518
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:00,810
It's also my first time
feeling at home at an emergency exit.

519
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,870
-Hello.
-You're here.

520
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,980
-Hello.
-Hey.

521
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:24,390
Baby, is something going on?
You don't look so well.

522
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:26,110
Nothing's going on.

523
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,590
Look at this.

524
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:35,870
Let's see.

525
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,500
What's wrong?

526
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:01,530
-Hello.
-Hey.

527
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:10,150
-What are you doing?
-My goodness.

528
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,340
You were thinking of me.

529
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:14,590
My gosh. People might hear you.

530
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,620
No one is around.

531
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,200
Gosh.

532
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:19,560
Did you see this?

533
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:22,510
Articles are flooding out on Oh In-hyung.

534
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:25,280
See? My gut feelings were right.

535
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:28,540
I told you that
she'll be the hottest issue.

536
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:31,000
What do you think will happen to us?

537
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,520
My gosh, you need to stop that.

538
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:36,200
I know you like it.

539
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:38,130
-What?
-Come on.

540
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:42,360
Stop it. My gosh.

541
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,380
What's wrong?

542
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:48,520
Hey, since when were you standing there?

543
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:52,120
Well, the...

544
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,380
The cast is on standby.

545
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:57,490
Let's get started, then.

546
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:00,570
Watch it.

547
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,460
I'm sorry.

548
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,870
Could you open the door?

549
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,980
Hold out a little longer, Geun-young.

550
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:26,880
You'll miss everything once it all passes.

551
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:31,110
Are you drunk?

552
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:35,330
You always pop my bubble
whenever I say something nice.

553
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:43,870
What's wrong?

554
00:39:45,140 --> 00:39:46,420
Nothing.

555
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,500
We're all ready. Please get set.

556
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:00,450
What should we do today?
Do you want to do anything?

557
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:04,770
Well, there's nothing much
we can do at home now.

558
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:07,540
Should we go on a trip
before it gets colder?

559
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:08,810
Then let's leave.

560
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:10,490
-Right now?
-Yes.

561
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:12,770
-Isn't that how people travel?
-Some do.

562
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:15,240
-Is it okay with you?
-Okay.

563
00:40:17,390 --> 00:40:19,150
-I guess.
-Okay, then.

564
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:22,100
Ms. No and Geun-young can discuss
where you want to go.

565
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:25,180
Who-joon, may I have a word with you?

566
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:29,320
Please.

567
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:39,700
He seriously has a knack
for throwing people off, right?

568
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:41,510
He does.

569
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:43,710
What is it?

570
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,870
You haven't heard, have you?

571
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,370
Hear what?

572
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:52,510
Today will be the last shooting.

573
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:55,320
What? All of a sudden?

574
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:57,870
Is there a problem?

575
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,900
It's not a problem, per se.

576
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:02,450
Who-joon's schedule is full too.

577
00:41:04,390 --> 00:41:06,320
Things were worked out
between the higher-ups.

578
00:41:07,470 --> 00:41:09,930
It's shocking, but what can we do?

579
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:11,600
Does Ms. Lee know?

580
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:15,960
What I want to tell you is...

581
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,040
Where do you want to go?

582
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:23,170
Geun-young?

583
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:25,640
-Yes?
-What's wrong?

584
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,970
Do you want to do something here?

585
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:29,160
No.

586
00:41:30,260 --> 00:41:35,140
Right? You'll be coming here
until you get sick of it anyway.

587
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:39,630
Why don't we go see the winter beach
and get some fresh air?

588
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:41,210
Okay.

589
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:45,170
Excuse me.

590
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:50,760
You're right.

591
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,290
I'll be coming here
until I get sick of this place.

592
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:03,740
(Geun-young.)

593
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:05,810
(Did I surprise you?)

594
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,990
(Gosh, a video message?)

595
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:13,070
(I get really awkward
when I do these things.)

596
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:19,930
(But I'm sending you this message
because I have to tell you something.)

597
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:23,190
(-I'm disappointed to say this.)
-I had no idea.

598
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,430
(But today, it's the last day we shoot)

599
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,120
("So I Married the Anti-Fan.")

600
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:31,370
(Throughout the shooting,)

601
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:34,450
(I feel like I gave you a tough time.)

602
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:37,090
(I'm sorry.)

603
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:40,000
(However,)

604
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:45,230
(I'll never forget every single moment
I shared with you on the set.)

605
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:48,970
(I don't know where to begin
or where to end this,)

606
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,860
(but what I do know is this.)

607
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:55,480
(You met me as an anti-fan,
but at this moment,)

608
00:42:57,510 --> 00:42:59,180
(I've become your fan.)

609
00:43:01,290 --> 00:43:06,880
(I'll never forget every moment
I spent with you, Geun-young.)

610
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:33,280
Thank you,

611
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:37,150
and I mean it, Geun-young.

612
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,100
Why are you crying?

613
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:04,740
It's all right. Okay?

614
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:17,850
Why? Why do we suddenly have to stop?

615
00:44:17,940 --> 00:44:21,280
I get that,
but why did you deceive me too?

616
00:44:21,370 --> 00:44:22,690
It's not that I deceived you.

617
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:24,930
I couldn't tell you.

618
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:31,670
Why not? You know better than anyone
how I must've felt when I got into this.

619
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:33,430
It's because I knew everything.

620
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:36,070
How can I tell you it's the last time?

621
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:40,070
But still, you should've told me.

622
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,260
I'm sorry.

623
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:45,000
Next time, you'll be the first to know.

624
00:44:45,090 --> 00:44:46,490
-Forget it.

You're so cute.

627
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:53,270
What's wrong with you?

628
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:54,540
Let's go.

629
00:44:55,030 --> 00:44:57,490
Come on, let's go. I promise.

-What?
-You know what.

633
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:14,170
That's enough TV show for now.

634
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:18,170
You won't have enough time
to prepare your album and concert.

635
00:45:18,830 --> 00:45:21,470
I already talked to the TV station,
so that's that.

636
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:25,210
You could've discussed this with me
at least once.

Hello?

Darn it.

Joon, let's talk to him again
after the shooting.

640

Okay.

Report on everything
outside of his schedule.

642
00:45:48,710 --> 00:45:50,780
Find out where he goes and who he sees.

643
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:52,540
Get on his tail.

644
00:45:55,570 --> 00:45:57,770
We nip the bud before it blooms,

645
00:45:57,860 --> 00:46:00,900
and tie up somebody
before they trample you.

646
00:46:05,910 --> 00:46:08,510
Why did you cry
as if we're really breaking up?

647
00:46:08,990 --> 00:46:10,270
That was embarrassing.

648
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:12,120
We can't break up anymore.
It'll break you.

649
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:14,620
I was really surprised. I had no idea.

650
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:16,740
Don't be so sad. It's for the better.

651

-Let's go on a date without cameras.
-Let's get going.

652
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:20,920
Let's go.

653
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:26,770
We'll start the camera now.

Don't be so wary of me.
I'm not here to do anything.

661
00:47:11,430 --> 00:47:13,450
You sent me the cancellation of contract,

662
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:16,530
but I've been doing my best for you.

663
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:18,550
What kind of "best" are you doing?

664
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,580
You aren't the type who would sit around

665

while my name goes out in the media
next to Joon's name.

but drop everything.

Why do you think I would want
to cut off your hard-earned wings?

669
00:47:37,430 --> 00:47:41,480
And the industry has been
making a connection between you two

670

Don't you get it?

If you're going to do anything weird,
just drop it.

I learned a lot from everything you did.

687
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:36,300
I realized how pathetic it is

688
00:48:36,390 --> 00:48:39,470
to put up a struggle
when you can't be half as good as someone.

689

Can you leave?

690
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:48,400
I have to compete with young
and talented kids, so I got no time.

691
00:48:51,790 --> 00:48:52,890
Really?

692
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:56,500
It really was like that.

693
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:58,340
So what do you want after?

-Let's get ramyeon.
-Okay.

695
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:10,800
You drove when we first got started,

696
00:49:11,590 --> 00:49:13,000
but I drive on our last episode.

697
00:49:13,740 --> 00:49:15,420
That day still makes me shudder.

698

It's our last day.

00:49:16,650 --> 00:49:19,550
Let's not mind anybody else
and enjoy our day.

Okay?

701
00:49:37,590 --> 00:49:39,130
-Okay.
-Great work.

702
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:41,900
Take this.

703
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:46,260
-This is nice.
-It's nice.

704
00:49:49,030 --> 00:49:50,260
Aren't you glad we came out?

705
00:49:50,350 --> 00:49:52,810
Now that we're facing the end,

706
00:49:52,900 --> 00:49:56,600
could you two please be nice to each other
and try to look like a real couple?

707
00:49:56,690 --> 00:49:58,090
Did we seem that distant?

708
00:49:58,180 --> 00:50:01,260
I'm sure you're closer than before,

709
00:50:01,350 --> 00:50:03,810
but you two aren't
in such a loving relationship.

710
00:50:04,690 --> 00:50:05,790
Right?

711
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:08,740
Then what do we do now?

712
00:50:08,830 --> 00:50:13,230
Well, what do couples do
when they're at the beach?

713
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:15,560
Let's figure something out.

714
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:27,090
Are you saying In-hyung is suing me?

715
00:50:35,230 --> 00:50:39,450
Do you have to take things this far
to cut me off?

716
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:45,480
Were you that sick and tired of me?

717
00:50:51,950 --> 00:50:53,750
This doesn't seem too special.

718
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:56,170
I guess couples feel happy
just to walk with one another.

719
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:57,490
I'm sure.

720
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:01,410
If it doesn't seem too special,

721
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:04,090
can they do something
and make this special?

722
00:51:04,180 --> 00:51:07,170
I mean, no matter
how awful their relationship is,

723
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:09,900
if they're here now,
can't they be like a real couple?

724
00:51:09,990 --> 00:51:11,750
You know, holding hands,

725
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:14,920
-then put arms around...
-Excuse me, you two! Can you hold hands?

726
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:17,910
-They did.
-They did.

727
00:51:24,030 --> 00:51:25,130
It's okay.

728
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:31,370
I don't think I ever got to enjoy
the little things in life.

729
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:33,920
As I kept my eyes on you,

730
00:51:34,010 --> 00:51:38,150
I realized fame and living a fancy life
aren't always a good thing.

731
00:51:38,410 --> 00:51:42,550
I've always been confident that
I never had any regrets in that aspect.

732
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:45,670
Come to think about it,

733
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,750
I do have some regrets.

734
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:50,560
Everyone regrets.

735
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:52,800
Nobody is perfect.

736
00:51:52,890 --> 00:51:55,530
That's why
I'm not going to do that anymore.

737
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:58,390
Someone told me not to be afraid,

738
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:00,020
that this too shall pass.

739
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:06,530
I'm hungry. Aren't you?

740
00:52:07,190 --> 00:52:09,040
I've been hungry for a while.

741
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:10,360
You are, right?

742
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:13,700
Mr. Han, did you hear that?

743
00:52:13,790 --> 00:52:15,720
How can you not feed us
while we're working?

744
00:52:16,740 --> 00:52:17,840
Let's eat something.

745
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:20,430
Yes, I totally got that. Cut!

746
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:22,100
Cut!

-Hurry up.

748
00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:26,860
Do you have a jacket?

749
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:28,350
-You can use this.
-I'm fine.

750
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:29,630
-Put it on.
-No.

751
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:31,210
You'll catch a cold. Let's go.

752
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:32,880
-I'm fine, really.
-Keep it on.

Come in.

758

00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,100
Yes, sir.

761
00:52:51,890 --> 00:52:53,430
What brings you to my office?

762
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,370
I had to discuss something,

763
00:52:55,460 --> 00:52:57,300
and you wouldn't have come
even if I asked.

764
00:52:57,610 --> 00:52:58,710
Please take a seat.

765
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:07,380
Is it Ms. Oh In-hyung's lawsuit?
What should I do?

766
00:53:07,470 --> 00:53:09,760
Will you settle this?
Or should we continue?

767
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:12,130
It's obviously a breach of contract,

768
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:15,780
so is there a way to make her pay
a huge compensation?

769
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:20,090
As I mentioned before,
the contract doesn't state that.

770
00:53:20,180 --> 00:53:22,340
I'm only your legal attorney,

771
00:53:22,430 --> 00:53:24,580
not your troubleshooter.

772
00:53:27,130 --> 00:53:29,070
Have you always been that uptight?

773
00:53:29,470 --> 00:53:30,570
Sorry?

774
00:53:31,930 --> 00:53:34,570
Let's put the lawsuit off for now.

775
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:36,860
It's not like I'm in a hurry.

776
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:39,320
-Okay.
-Oh, right.

777
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:42,490
What if someone gets sued for exposing
someone's history without evidence?

778
00:53:42,580 --> 00:53:45,170
What happens in this case?

779
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:49,790
That happens from time to time
in the entertainment business.

780
00:53:51,070 --> 00:53:52,300
Who's in question?

781
00:53:53,090 --> 00:53:55,910
-You?
-No, not me.

782
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,320
I'll find some precedents.

785
00:54:17,070 --> 00:54:18,170
Pardon?

786
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:22,750
Oh, it's nothing.

787
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:25,570
It's just a personal keepsake.

788
00:54:25,650 --> 00:54:28,160
Oh, I see.

789
00:54:38,850 --> 00:54:41,010
-Here's your fish cake.
-Thank you.

790
00:54:45,540 --> 00:54:48,840
Don't they seem a bit odd today?

791
00:54:48,930 --> 00:54:52,540
I know it's the last time,
but why does she look at him so ardently?

792
00:54:52,620 --> 00:54:55,090
Is it so heartbreaking
to see him order tteokbokki?

793
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:56,890
Why? Why are you staring at me?

794
00:54:57,380 --> 00:55:00,460
Nothing, you look really pretty
when you work hard.

795
00:55:01,420 --> 00:55:04,200
-What's with you?
-Is it just me?

796
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:06,570
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

797
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:10,750
All right.

798
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:12,380
Wait.

799
00:55:14,010 --> 00:55:16,380
-Stop it.
-Come on.

800
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:21,270
(Old-fashioned tteokbokki, Fish cake)

801
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:23,860
-So? Is it good?
-It's good.

802
00:55:23,950 --> 00:55:26,720
There's a great tteokbokki place
in Dangjin, actually.

803
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:32,750
The tteokbokki there is amazing.
We should go there sometime.

804
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:35,390
Dangjin? I haven't heard
of a place like that.

805
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:37,860
If you went there, it'd be famous by now.

806
00:55:37,940 --> 00:55:40,500
What's amazing is this.

807
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:42,830
The owner lady there has no idea who I am.

808
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:45,340
No way, how can anyone not know
who you are?

809
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:47,840
I mean it. That's not important to her.

810
00:55:47,930 --> 00:55:50,530
She's only invested in tteokbokki.
She's a master.

811
00:55:50,620 --> 00:55:52,900
It must be a really good place.

812
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:54,880
Why aren't you eating?

813
00:55:54,970 --> 00:55:57,520
Seeing you eat makes me feel full.

814
00:55:57,610 --> 00:56:00,300
Here. Let me feed you too. Open up.

815
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:04,520
-This fish cake is delicious.
-Take a big manly bite.

816
00:56:04,610 --> 00:56:06,370
-The fish cake is really good.
-Really?

817
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:08,130
-Let's eat together.
-Open up.

818
00:56:09,490 --> 00:56:11,960
-You're eating so well.
-Open up.

819
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:16,000
Is Dangjin famous for tteokbokki?

820
00:56:16,710 --> 00:56:18,290
I don't know.

821
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:21,420
But something is
definitely weird with them.

822
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:23,660
It's better than
seeing them bicker to the end.

823
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:25,380
(You're eating so well.)

824
00:56:28,150 --> 00:56:31,310
I need information on this guy too.
A lawyer named Cho Hae-yoon.

825
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:32,770
I'll send you his business card.

826
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:35,850
And he's in his 50s.

827
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:39,280
But there was someone
who had a photo among his friends,

828
00:56:39,370 --> 00:56:41,480
so I decided to take that.

829
00:56:42,620 --> 00:56:45,440
What about the photo of the ring owner?

830
00:56:46,230 --> 00:56:47,420
Did you get it?

831
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:49,000
All right.

832
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:11,880
(Thank you.)

833
00:57:15,530 --> 00:57:18,750
This is it?
You aren't going to put anything else?

834
00:57:18,830 --> 00:57:21,650
There are lots of unsaid words
in "Thank you."

835
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:23,500
-I'm very grateful.
-Come on.

836
00:57:23,590 --> 00:57:26,050
-Give it to me. Give it.
-No. Why?

837
00:57:26,140 --> 00:57:28,290
-It's a shame, really.
-You'll do something weird.

838
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:31,110
-Nothing weird. Just trust me.
-No way.

839
00:57:31,290 --> 00:57:33,180
Give it to me. You'll hurt your hand.

840
00:57:33,270 --> 00:57:35,250
Instead of leaving it like this,

841
00:57:35,330 --> 00:57:38,720
do something like, you know, this.

842
00:57:39,070 --> 00:57:39,290
(Thank you.)

843
00:57:39,290 --> 00:57:41,710
-I knew you'd do this.
-Isn't this sweet?
(Thank you.)

844
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:44,270
-No way.
-Just leave it like this.

845
00:57:45,010 --> 00:57:46,510
Will you give me an autograph?

846
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:50,510
Okay, sure. I'll probably spend
all my life signing autographs.

847
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:25,270
I guess the beach is
also pretty nice in winter.

848
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:26,460
Today is

849
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,770
the last time we spend together.
It feels weird.

850
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:32,660
-Doesn't it?
-It does.

851
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:36,010
Don't forget
all the time we spent together.

852
00:58:39,090 --> 00:58:41,730
How could I? I had such a tough time.

853
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:43,800
You're right.

854
00:58:58,050 --> 00:58:59,900
Thank you. I mean it.

855
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:03,820
Are you cold?

856
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:07,560
No, don't try to give me your coat.
I really don't like that.

857
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:11,120
I got cold and just wanted to button up.
You're so full of yourself.

858
00:59:11,210 --> 00:59:15,080
Right, I knew it.
I shouldn't have taken it the wrong way.

859
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:29,560
Here. You aren't cold now, are you?

860
00:59:31,670 --> 00:59:33,030
I'm okay, really.

861
00:59:36,730 --> 00:59:39,370
They finally seem like a real couple.

862
00:59:39,460 --> 00:59:41,790
Looking nice.

863
00:59:46,540 --> 00:59:49,310
Cut. That's all. Great job, everyone.

864
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:51,470
-Great work!
-Mr. Seo?

865
00:59:51,550 --> 00:59:53,090
What's next on Who-joon's schedule?

866
00:59:53,750 --> 00:59:55,380
Everything is really over.

867
00:59:56,170 --> 00:59:58,200
Great work to the end.

868
00:59:59,390 --> 01:00:00,490
It's not the end.

869
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:03,430
It's just the beginning.
