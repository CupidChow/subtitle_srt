(You Keep Getting on My Mind)

10
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,940
I want to go home.

11
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,030
Why did I tag along anyway?
Look at this mess.

12
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:28,210
Mom...

13
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,440
Found you.

14
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,250
I told you to stay focused on me.

15
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:02,490
Where have you been?

16
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:15,200
Why is a grown woman like you
crying out on a street?

17
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:18,060
I looked back thinking you were there,

18
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:21,540
but I was really startled
when I didn't see anybody there.

19
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:23,120
I'm tired. Let's go.

20
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,520
What? Did you get hurt?

21
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:31,310
I can't believe you.

22
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,200
Come here.

23
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:35,880
Okay, fine. Get on my back. Here.

24
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:38,350
I don't need to get on your back.
It's not that bad.

25
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,150
Get on my back while the offer stands.

26
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:43,360
Get on your back?
Your back is covered in sweat.

27
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:44,820
It's all because of you.

28
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,590
I literally ran around the entire town.

29
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,360
And if your phone doesn't work,
why didn't you just stay there?

30
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:53,130
If this was your first time in Japan,
you should've said so.

31
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,320
Why did you lie?

32
00:02:54,579 --> 00:02:56,520
Don't even get me started.

33
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,440
Okay, fine. Whatever.

34
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,640
Let's go. Give me that.

35
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,260
-Give me your hand.
-No.

36
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,940
Just give me your hand.

37
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,760
You're back.

38
00:03:44,829 --> 00:03:45,930
Is something wrong?

39
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,840
The flight tomorrow morning
might get canceled.

40
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:52,050
There's a storm coming.

41
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,340
Isolation is the best
in overseas business trips.

42
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,660
We have no time to joke around.

43
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:58,560
If a storm comes, we won't leave, period.

44
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,940
Let's watch the first episode
and eat dinner as planned.

45
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,400
You're saying that
even after you got the call.

46
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:06,260
You'll get in trouble if you don't make it
to the meeting tomorrow.

47
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:07,450
Then what?

48
00:04:08,810 --> 00:04:10,880
We should leave today if we can.

49
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:14,970
But I guess the situation is the same
for everyone. There aren't many tickets.

50
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:18,050
Other staff are at the airport waiting,

51
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,649
so we have to leave as soon as they call.

52
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:25,270
Don't worry about Joon and me.
If all fails, we'll get ourselves home.

53
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,770
We'd be grateful if you'd do that.

54
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,060
Geun-young, you should start packing.

55
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,250
Okay.

56
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:34,110
I can't get left behind on this island.

57
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:36,659
That home isn't even my place,
but I'm starting to miss it.

58
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,230
I'm craving kimchi too.

59
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:46,120
-Geun-young, I'm sorry.
-What's wrong?

60
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:49,909
I got a call from the airport,
and they didn't find enough seats.

61
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,090
You should go.

62
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,330
I'm sorry we have to leave you here.

63
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,270
Don't mind me.

64
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:01,350
Mr. Han, you don't have to feel so bad.

65
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,160
No, don't you mind him.

66
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,850
He just doesn't want to leave.

67
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,530
Drink this.

68
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,720
I don't want it.

69
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:14,410
No worries. Even if the storm gets longer,
we'll do our best to avoid it.

70
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,610
You have our trust, Mr. Seo.

71
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,470
I'm so relieved that
Geun-young won't be left here alone.

72
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,500
Okay, goodbye.

73
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,300
-Let's go.
-I don't want to.

74
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:26,120
-We'll go, then. Let's go.
-Bye.

75
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:33,110
(I really want this.)

76
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,360
You don't mind having me
as a partner, do you?

77
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:36,900
I don't care

78
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,230
who plays my partner.

79
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:42,750
You don't care?

80
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:46,010
Those two are unbelievable.

81
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:48,730
If they don't mind that much,

82
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:52,170
then should I try putting them
on the palm of my hand?

83
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:18,740
You must be hungry
from bawling and getting lost.

84
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,060
Not really.

85
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:21,780
Don't mind me and get your rest.

86
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:28,460
Haven't you heard that a convenience store
is the best of a trip in Japan?

87
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:30,620
Stop doing weird stuff

88
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,820
and eat this.

89
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:38,890
Bye.

90
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:46,640
I'm so considerate.

91
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,460
What has gotten into him?

92
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:52,659
Did these expire?

93
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,540
This convenience store food is delicious.

94
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,170
Who is it this time?

95
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,310
Flower delivery.

96
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:14,970
Jae-joon?

97
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:18,840
And some taco rice.

98
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,180
Goodness.

99
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,640
You came here to give me this?

100
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:27,290
This is probably
the best taco rice in Japan.

101
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,100
You must try it once you're here.

102
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:32,790
Thank you so much
for being so considerate.

103
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:36,140
(We're meeting
your father's acquaintance tonight.)

104
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,760
(Get ready and meet me at the lobby.)

105
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:56,510
I have a flight tonight,
so I should get going.

106
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,930
-I came to give you that.
-Thank you so much.

107
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,600
Let me buy you a meal in Seoul.

108
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:02,180
Do you mean it?

109
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,250
-Goodbye, then.
-Goodbye.

110
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:12,790
Geun-young.

111
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,740
Yes?

112
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:22,160
Well, did you give my offer a thought
about signing with me?

113
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:25,590
My gosh, stop joking around.

114
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,130
I'm not a celebrity or something.

115
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:31,660
It was very comforting
just to hear you say that.

116
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:35,620
A CEO doesn't always go around
buying food for someone to sign.

117
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:38,260
-Go on, then.
-Goodbye. Thanks for the food.

118
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,610
Funny seeing you here.

119
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,670
What brings you here?

120
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:56,650
I came to meet a friend.

121
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:01,100
Good. I needed to talk to you.

122
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:09,280
Do you feel uncomfortable sitting with me?

123
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:11,390
It's not that relaxing.

124
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,980
What is it?

125
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,320
Where's Ji-hyang?

126
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,750
He'll be here soon. What do you want?

127
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,110
You seem cranky.

128
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:28,730
Thanks for not making a fuss
about In-hyung shooting an ad with you.

129
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,840
I said I didn't care who it was.

130
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:33,130
Right? You shouldn't care.

131
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,460
I mean, it's work,

132
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,630
and what happened
between you two is history.

133
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:44,530
If that's all,
there's no need for you to say that to me.

134
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,250
It really doesn't matter.

135
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,660
I see.

136
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,450
Now that you say you don't care,

137
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:53,900
let me be frank with you.

138
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,420
Do you want to sign with me?

139
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,030
My agency
and even the headquarters want you.

140
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:03,890
This ad was done
in connection with our agency as well.

141
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:06,570
Things got a little hectic
when In-hyung came because of that.

142
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:09,830
But there's no need
to make things more complicated.

143
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:12,110
If you join my agency,

144
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,720
everything will be
smoothened out perfectly.

145
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,400
Smoothened out.

146
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,400
Of course, I'll make the deal smooth

147
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:27,340
and give you a better contract.

148
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:29,760
Our revenue sharing will be eight to two.

149
00:10:29,850 --> 00:10:33,230
You can take 100 percent of the ad gig
you make with the headquarters.

150
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:36,090
You know that
our headquarters is huge, right?

151
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,520
Isn't Shooting Star too small

152
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:41,420
for you to stay?

153
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,560
Didn't you also want to

154
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:45,160
make your debut and
become a success in that small agency?

155
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:50,830
Jae-joon.

156
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:54,220
I didn't move with you back then.

157
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,260
Do you think I'll do it now?

158
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:03,020
Hey, honestly speaking,

159
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:06,280
don't you think
you've stayed loyal enough?

160
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,220
If you don't care about your past,

161
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:12,260
you should keep your loyalty
with me and In-hyung too.

162
00:11:13,230 --> 00:11:16,750
Once you join us,
In-hyung might get her success as well.

163
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,020
That's your job.

164
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:19,960
If you can't get
a girl that talented to succeed,

165
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:22,340
don't you think you're too brazen
to ask me to join you?

166
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:28,850
That's why I'm here
trying to do some good business.

167
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,490
Goodbye.

168
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:34,740
What is this?

169
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,770
This is good.

170
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:43,020
(Oh, and did I mention this?)

171
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:45,130
(I'm thinking about signing a deal
with Geun-young.)

172
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,210
Stop causing unnecessary trouble.

173
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:51,510
You can bring her with you.

174
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,360
You said you'd embrace your anti-fan.

175
00:11:54,410 --> 00:11:56,520
If you want to keep your word,
keep it to the end.

176
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:02,330
Joon.

177
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,380
What's going on?

178
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,800
If he wants to be hostile,
he should just be hostile.

179
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:14,870
How can he ask you to sign with him?

180
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,640
He should stick with one course of action.

181
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,520
Storms aren't the only thing
that changes course.

182
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:22,790
Tell me about it.

183
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,180
Oh, and Joon, I don't think your father is

184
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:27,810
a Japanese man.

185
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,710
The man we're about to meet is
also Korean.

186
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,760
Did you tell anyone
that I'm looking for him?

187
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:37,620
No way. I didn't. Don't worry about it.

188
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:39,120
The car is here.

189
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,580
Let's go.

190
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:56,100
Where are the two of them going
by themselves?

191
00:12:57,150 --> 00:13:00,720
I'm full, so full.

192
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:02,650
I need to digest.

193
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:16,160
Excuse me.

194
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:19,590
It's you, right?

195
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,540
-Yes.
-Hello.

196
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:26,550
Wait.

197
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,740
Who-joon isn't there right now.

198
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:38,510
Really? I was going to say goodbye
before I left for the airport.

199
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,510
I don't know where he is,
but he said he had to do something.

200
00:13:41,590 --> 00:13:43,930
All right. I'll call him. Thanks.

201
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:45,110
Sure.

202
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:56,910
Why did you come here again?
What if Ji-hyang saw you?

203
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:11,210
(Yes? Who is it?)

204
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:14,680
Please excuse us. I'm Seo Ji-hyang,
the one who contacted you.

205
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:23,530
Have you seen a ring like this?

206
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:28,590
He helped him out greatly,
so we have to find this person.

207
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:34,170
Yes, I think it's that ring.

208
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:37,210
I designed this.

209
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:40,250
A group of friends in college
all got matching rings.

210
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:43,850
The year 1991.
That's the year when we graduated.

211
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:46,850
I saw some letters in there.
Could that mean anything?

212
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:51,160
We each engraved
something we wanted on the inside.

213
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:55,200
By any chance, are you still in contact
with your friends who has those rings?

214
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:59,430
Of course, we all wear this
whenever we get together.

215
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,640
Then is there anyone
who lost the ring and came without it?

216
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:05,760
They all have it on.
We all promised to do that.

217
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:11,480
This 1991 means
it's definitely the same ring we got.

218
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:15,220
But I'm not sure about the engraving.

219
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,570
I'm sorry I couldn't help you.

220
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:22,260
Don't say that, sir.
Thank you for seeing us.

221
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:25,650
Right, there was one more guy.

222
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:27,810
Sorry?

223
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,620
(Kim and Park)

224
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:18,720
"YAMA"?

225
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,300
That's your dad's ring.

226
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,720
It's the only thing he left behind.

227
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:32,440
I thought I lost it.

228
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,780
(Spa and Aroma Therapy)

229
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,840
I guess there's a hot spring here.

230
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:52,680
Even I know that hot springs are
a great tourist attraction here.

231
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,120
Shall I?

232
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,580
Where have you been?

233
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:05,000
Did you have work?

234
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,500
Where's Ji-hyang?

235
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:20,180
Is something going on?

236
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:22,599
What's with him this time?

237
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:34,040
A ring?

238
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:38,220
My gosh.

239
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:42,310
It's completely different
from a bathhouse.

240
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:47,950
My goodness!

241
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,550
Have you gone crazy?

242
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,240
Why are you sitting here alone?

243
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:56,310
Why didn't you say you were here?

244
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:58,510
My gosh, what a surprise.

245
00:17:59,430 --> 00:18:00,660
Are you here alone?

246
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,240
Wait, you didn't
empty this place out, did you?

247
00:18:06,430 --> 00:18:08,850
Then I'll stick around for a little.

248
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,340
This is great.

249
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:19,930
I love it.

250
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,500
Do you want some eggs?

251
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:26,530
Who am I talking to?

252
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:28,470
I might as well talk to a wall.

253
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,650
Once I got here,

254
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:41,190
I seriously began to crave
some tteokbokki and soju. Right?

255
00:18:47,610 --> 00:18:50,820
Right, there was one more guy.

256
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:53,990
We couldn't reach him
ever since our graduation,

257
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:57,820
so it has been too long since we saw him.

258
00:18:58,570 --> 00:19:01,470
That ring could've belonged to him.

259
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:05,470
We looked everywhere for him,
but it was no use.

260
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,980
Stop staring at me.

261
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:25,540
Wow, 40 minutes.

262
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:31,830
How can you
sit there silently for 40 minutes?

263
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,580
Would the abandoned be more scared?

264
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,760
Or is it scarier
for the abandoned to return?

265
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:48,770
Wouldn't it be scarier
for the abandoned to return?

266
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,230
They know they'd be blamed for leaving.

267
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,220
Don't they deserve to be blamed?

268
00:19:54,310 --> 00:19:55,630
They do.

269
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,740
But the abandoned can at least blame them.

270
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:04,080
Have you ever blamed anyone?

271
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,460
Yes, I do that a lot.

272
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:09,140
I blamed Ms. Cha for firing me

273
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,860
and you for causing...

274
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:13,540
See? You blame other people too.

275
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,360
I had no time to blame anybody.

276
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,200
I was busy trying to survive.

277
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:22,470
You need to help me understand.

278
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,060
What are you doing?

279
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:30,960
Blaming.

280
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,900
Gosh.

281
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:37,520
Can you stick with one course of action?

282
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:39,630
Are you trying to talk or what?

283
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,670
Are you a storm?
You can't just change courses like that.

284
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,990
I don't know what it's about,

285
00:20:49,930 --> 00:20:52,350
but this too shall pass.

286
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,480
Are you leaving?

287
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,150
He's leaving
in the middle of a conversation?

288
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,450
(I'm not here right now,)

289
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,260
(so leave a message.)

290
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,240
(I'm not home at the moment.)

291
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:37,150
(Please leave a message,
and I'll get back to you.)

292
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:44,810
Why did you keep that ring?

293
00:22:47,490 --> 00:22:50,090
What did he mean to you, Mom?

294
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:03,200
Can't you just pick up
when times are hard for me?

295
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,030
You can be really cold.

296
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,980
I'm sorry.
I asked them, but they didn't find a ring.

297
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,310
I can't help it, then.

298
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,260
-Hey.
-Morning.

299
00:23:30,350 --> 00:23:32,500
We checked you out too.
Was there a problem?

300
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:34,130
No, it's nothing.

301
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:36,990
-Then let's head over to the car.
-Okay.

302
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,190
-Are you Ms. Lee Geun-young?
-Yes.

303
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:22,580
Your seat has been upgraded,
so we'd like to help you move.

304
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,950
Upgraded? My seat?

305
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,460
Yes, we'll take your luggage for you.

306
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:30,720
Wait, are you sure it's me? I doubt it.

307
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:35,380
No, it's you.
Please get up, and we'll get you settled.

308
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:39,160
I think you got something wrong.
This is my seat.

309
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:42,240
Maybe you have the wrong name.

310
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:46,160
Aren't you Ms. Lee Geun-young?

311
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:49,200
Then it's you.
Your seat is upgraded with mileage.

312
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:53,020
I see, the mileage?
Then it definitely isn't me.

313
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:56,810
Maybe there was a mistake in the system.

314
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,940
You make this very hard for me.

315
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:05,040
It is you, Ms. Lee Geun-young.
Let me move your luggage.

316
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,020
But it can't be me.

317
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:29,230
How did you get here?
I was worried about you.

318
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:33,110
Exactly. She said
my seat was upgraded with mileage,

319
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:34,910
but I don't have any.

320
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:37,550
I see.

321
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:41,550
Gosh, I'm so lucky today. Is it because
I did something good in the morning?

322
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,930
Why? Did something happen this morning?

323
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:46,790
It looked like
someone lost their ring yesterday.

324
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,640
So I left it in the lobby.

325
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:51,590
What kind of ring?

326
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,830
No idea. It looked pretty old.

327
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,600
It had Roman numerals on the side.

328
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:01,270
Geun-young, great work.

329
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:02,450
What?

330
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:06,020
And it's now found.

331
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:08,700
Anyway, what do we get for a meal here?

332
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:10,950
The meal? We get steak.

333
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:14,600
-Steak?
-Yes. You can pick and choose as you like.

334
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:17,240
-Steak is served on a plane?
-Isn't it awesome?

335
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:28,150
The reactions after the first episode
must be crazy.

336
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,170
It won't be easy to leave the airport.

337
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:34,400
Geun-young, you're going to be fine
as you leave the airport with us,

338
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:36,950
but I still think
you should brace yourself.

339
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:39,150
The show had that much influence?

340
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:42,540
My fans are gnashing their teeth,

341
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:44,080
waiting to see you.

342
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:49,090
Will you be okay?

343
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,560
Of course. I'll have to face it.

344
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:53,270
It's not like they'll kill me.

We're here at the scene.

They just got here. Let's go.

350
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:11,450
Did you expect the show
to become this sensational?

351
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:13,030
Why did you spike his drink?

352
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,490
Did you decide to do the show
to get your revenge?

353
00:27:17,610 --> 00:27:18,840
Please say something!

354
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:26,410
-Were you really trying to kill him?
-You better quit now.

355
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:29,090
I swear I'm going to kill you, okay?

356
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:33,750
First off, I'd like to thank you
for showing a lot of interest.

357
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:37,490
But that was just the first episode.
Please continue to tune in.

358
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:41,670
Also, please refrain from misunderstanding
or criticizing Geun-young. Goodbye.

359

-Wait!
-One more question!

360
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,840
How do you feel right now?

361
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:47,390
-Please say something!
-Say something!

362
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,860
Are you all right?

363
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,510
-Everyone.
-Yes?

364
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,490
Do you want me to feel sorry for her?

365
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:00,900
-No.
-No.

366
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:04,900
As my fans, please be generous
and be a little understanding, okay?

367
00:28:04,990 --> 00:28:06,400
-Okay.
-Okay.

368

-Who-joon's staff took it.

I'm sure you're a bit flustered,

371
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,390
but that's the thing about variety shows.

372
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,520
I'm not getting through you, am I?

373
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,210
All right.
You should get some rest on your way home.

if you don't look it up.

("The Anti-Fan Threatens
Who-joon's Life, Was This Her Plan?")

378
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,470
Hey, Geun-young.

379
00:29:08,570 --> 00:29:12,620
To put it nicely, it means people are
giving lots of attention to this program.

380
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:16,010
-Put it badly then.
-It's a witch hunt.

381
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:20,140
The worse you look,
the more angelic Who-joon seems.

382
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:23,440
That's what most people
think of an anti-fan.

383
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:26,960
That's the fact.

384
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:32,200
Things turned out like this
through the editing process.

385
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:34,530
I'll just cut my hands off, then.

386
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:40,520
Well, I had to get across that
you two are a top star and an anti-fan.

387
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:44,910
The viewers don't want to see you two
get along at this point.

388
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,170
So what I'm trying to say is

389
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:51,690
that a ball has to hit rock bottom
to bounce back up high.

390
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:52,970
Please remember that.

391
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:53,270
When I meet a ball, I'll tell them that.

I'd like to bounce out of here now.

Goodness.

396
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,090
Brighten up.

397
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,850
It's a huge hit.

398
00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:11,010
Aren't you glad you did as I said?

399

405
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:24,820
Don't be so cranky.

406
00:30:25,570 --> 00:30:28,430
Young-suk. Hey, you are here too, Joon.

407
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,820

get on a first-name basis?

408
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:39,910
You look happy, Young-suk.

409
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:45,330
He's impossible.

410
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:47,130
He threw a fit

411
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:50,170
and said it's unfair
that only you get to call me by my name.

412
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:55,310
Sounds great. You like it
when people call you by your name.

And you also like impossible guys.

How are you so successful
in everything you do?

00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,920
Okay. Thank you for understanding.

479
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:04,310
Did you watch his show last night?

480
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:07,870
I can't believe how professional he is.

481
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:10,380
Pretentiousness is his second nature.

482
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:13,500
You should learn that from him.

483
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,810
Go ahead, eat.

484
00:35:18,390 --> 00:35:19,490
Okay.

485
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:26,040
Why did you go to the airport
so early yesterday?

486
00:35:26,570 --> 00:35:27,930
You left the hotel really early.

487
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:31,630
You said you'll go
straight to the airport,

488
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,230
-so I went early to buy some stuff.
-I see.

489
00:35:34,310 --> 00:35:37,040
Anyway, where were you?
Why were you so late?

490
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:39,370
I went to see Joon at the hotel.

491
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:43,030
Why are you so surprised?

492
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:45,580
I went in an attempt
to get along with him.

493
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:48,310
I see.

494
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:52,710
I have to use the restroom.

495
00:35:57,990 --> 00:35:59,350
"Thank you for understanding"?

496
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,840
She's so bad at lying.

497
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:06,610
Did she fix her phone or what?

498
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:09,730
You still can't reach her?
I thought she'd be here.

499
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:12,500
-You're here pretty often.
-Yes, I am.

500
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,920
I heard there was a huge scene
at the airport.

501
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:17,300
Can she continue to live in Korea?

502
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:19,850
Maybe we should move abroad with her.

503
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:23,150
-I'll get you some beer.
-Okay.

504
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:29,840
Why haven't you been dating recently?

505
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:31,420
I'm too tired.

506
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:35,690
I find it much better to grab some beer
with chicken before going home.

507
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:38,070
You said you like the skin, right?
You can have this.

508
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,120
Are you telling me
that I can only be skin-deep?

509
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:44,670
Sorry? What do you mean?

510
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,570
-I mean, the skin.
-Hey.

511
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:48,760
Geun-young.

512
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:57,250
We have to watch this, right?

513
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,840
-Yes.
-Right.

514
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:02,180
She says she couldn't watch it alone.

515
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,640
(Geun-young shows a meaningful smile.)

516
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:11,380
(Cunning and sly)

517
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,870
(My stomach suddenly...)

518
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:15,030
(An emergency)

519
00:37:15,030 --> 00:37:15,120
(-Are you okay?
-What's wrong?)

520
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,660
(Who-joon collapses with a stomachache.)
(-Are you okay?
-What's wrong?)

521
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:16,740
(Who-joon collapses with a stomachache.)

522
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:17,760
(-What?
-Joon, you okay?)
(Who-joon collapses with a stomachache.)

523
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:17,840
(Who-joon collapses with a stomachache.)

524
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,120
(-Are you okay?
-What's wrong?)
(Who-joon collapses with a stomachache.)

525
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:19,210
(Who-joon collapses with a stomachache.)

526
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:20,350
(-Joon.
-What's going on?)
(Who-joon collapses with a stomachache.)

527
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:20,880
(-Joon.
-What's going on?)

528
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:23,040
(-Who-joon.
-Get an ambulance!)

529
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,280
(Was something in his beverage?)

530
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:26,910
(It was me.)

531
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:30,870
(A sudden confession! It was me!)

532
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,260
(What did she do to Who-joon's drink?)

533
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:49,130
Geun-young, I'm a law student.

534
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:51,150
You don't have to worry.

535
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,840
You won't be sued
although it is an attempted...

536
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:00,080
Should we sue them?

537
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:01,580
Let's say it was evil editing

538
00:38:01,670 --> 00:38:03,210
and sue them for defamation!

539
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:05,540
-Should I call a friend at a law firm?
-Yes, do that.

540
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:07,080
You don't have to try so hard.

541
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:10,860
So you could tell
that we were trying hard.

542
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:14,560
Okay, have a glass of beer, and forget it.

543
00:38:14,650 --> 00:38:16,410
-Yes.
-Get her some more beer.

544
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:17,680
How can I forget it?

545
00:38:18,870 --> 00:38:20,760
Could you do that? Could you?

546
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:23,620
I heard the show was a huge hit.

547
00:38:23,710 --> 00:38:25,510
Which means a lot of people saw it.

548
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,670
Is that your idea of comforting me?

549
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:29,910
Geun-young...

550
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:35,900
Hey, you can't take...

551
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:38,580
-Please don't take pictures.
-Geun-young.

552
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:39,770
Geun-young.

553
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:46,900
I called the hotel.
They'll keep the ring with them.

554
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:50,290
Do I have to get it back?

555
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:53,010
What do you mean?
It's the only thing left of your father.

556
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:59,040
Ji-hyang, ask them to keep it well
until I return to pick it up.

557
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:00,230
Okay.

558
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,130
Mr. Han called asking if you were okay.

559
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:05,690
I wonder if Geun-young is all right.

560
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:09,780
I hope she's not too hurt.

561
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:12,730
(Who-joon collapses with a stomachache.)

562
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:21,660
(Lee Geun-young)

563
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:33,140
(The door is locked.)

564
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:40,750
I guess this is the safest place.

565
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:47,750
(Drop Lee Geun-young from the show!
I'll get back at you.)

566
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:56,640
(We'll destroy that witch.
What's with her? Unbelievable.)

567
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:01,130
(Water balloon, flour, tomato, egg)

568
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:05,040
(Water balloon)

569
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:10,150
(Flour)

570
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:14,410
(I'll leave the parcel here!)

571
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:16,090
Parcel?

572
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:22,020
(What if there was a dead rat inside?)

573
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,290
(The door is opened.)

574
00:40:39,050 --> 00:40:41,080
Why did you leave the parcel out here?

575
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,140
Are you that lazy to leave it out here?

576
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:45,650
Did you order that?

577
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:48,380
I mean, I just got scared.

578
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:51,420
I remembered how you can get
a dead rat or something.

579
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:53,090
What's in that box?

580
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:00,660
It looked like

581
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,940
you should be staying home for a while.

582
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:06,770
So you got all these for me?

583
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:10,160
Thanks.

584
00:41:10,910 --> 00:41:14,160
You really are an angel.
I'm the evil witch right now.

585
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,310
Wait, you were looking those up?

586
00:41:19,880 --> 00:41:21,600
You're holding out better than I thought.

587
00:41:23,710 --> 00:41:25,740
Because I hate myself too.

588
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:34,230
Hey, there are always
more people who hate you

589
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,970
than those who love you in this world.

590
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,020
Is that your idea of comforting someone?

591
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:43,510
Doesn't it work?

592
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:47,560
It worked for me.

593
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,510
I'm going to grab some soju.
Do you want some?

594
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,620
You craved tteokbokki and soju in Japan.

595
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:58,340
Tteokbokki and soju again?

596
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:00,010
I guess you miss someone again.

597
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:02,780
Why are you bringing that up?
I got it because you wanted it,

598
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:05,340
and you're so... Gosh.

599
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:28,350
Did you watch the show?

600
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:31,120
Not just the show.

601
00:42:31,210 --> 00:42:33,540
I saw all kinds of swear words
I've never seen before.

602
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:37,190
I thought I would only hear people swear,
but now I guess I can read it as well.

603
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:40,050
Why did you read those?

604
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:42,650
Don't pretend like you don't.

605
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:45,770
I know entertainers
look up their articles too.

606
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:48,630
When I'd see news of entertainers
suing people over comments,

607
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,360
I also used to think,
"Why did they read it in the first place?"

608
00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:53,910
I mean,

609
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:58,440
how can adding old vitamin
turn into attempted murder?

610
00:42:58,530 --> 00:43:01,570
Exactly.
Why would you mess with someone's food?

611
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:04,510
Did you come here gleaming inside?

612
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:10,630
Goodness,
you're getting a call at this hour?

613
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:11,950
Boyfriend?

614
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:13,450
You actually have a boyfriend?

615
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:15,160
Why would you want to know?

616
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:25,720
What is it?

617
00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:28,230
Geun-young, you weren't like this before.

618
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:29,730
What are you talking about?

619
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:32,320
I watched the show.
That's not who you are.

620
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:34,790
You came to the restaurant last time
and yelled at me.

621
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:37,600
I just thought you changed only a little.

622
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:39,140
But you weren't that intense!

623
00:43:39,230 --> 00:43:43,500
I don't know. I just... I didn't know
you were that deeply hurt by me!

624
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:46,140
-Hey.
-I know that I hurt you, Geun-young.

625
00:43:46,230 --> 00:43:49,000
But what can I do?
I told you that I couldn't help it.

626
00:43:49,090 --> 00:43:50,630
Can't you be more understanding?

627
00:43:50,710 --> 00:43:52,520
(Is that what changed you like this?)

628
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:55,160
I feel so responsible
and tormented right now.

629
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:57,580
Hey! Stop adding to my trouble.

630
00:43:57,670 --> 00:44:01,140
Wasn't it enough to use me for your test?
Are you now doing an experiment

631
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:03,080
to see how much pride I hold?

632
00:44:03,170 --> 00:44:07,520
Why? Now that I'm a big issue,
do you want attention as my ex-boyfriend?

633
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:11,440
Oh my gosh. You're saying
everything you want without holding back!

634
00:44:11,530 --> 00:44:13,550
How much longer
do I have to hold myself back?

635
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:16,670
By any chance, did you devise a plan
to get close to Who-joon

636
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:19,490
because he's my friend?

637
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:23,710
If that's the case,
how am I going to live with the guilt?

638
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:27,150
Hey, I don't care
if you're Who-joon's friend or lover.

639
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:30,710
I couldn't care less,
you egocentric jerks!

640
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,530
You must be completely delusional.

641
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:38,060
Do you realize that I'm the one
who's keeping your secret quietly?

642
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:40,390
If you make another call,

643
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:43,780
I'll write an article
and shut down your restaurant.

644
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:48,440
Why do I have to deal with this?

645
00:44:56,270 --> 00:44:58,870
I guess that wasn't such a pleasant call.

646
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,540
I became a national gossip

647
00:45:00,630 --> 00:45:02,480
after a show
with their favorite idol star.

648
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:06,960
My ex-boyfriend is worried that
I became a wreck after our relationship.

649
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:10,880
I'm starting to feel sorry.

650
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:14,220
You can actually say sorry?

651
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:17,170
This is new.

652
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,420
It's nothing compared to
all the criticism you got.

653
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,570
I shouldn't be
complaining or blaming anyone.

654
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:24,260
It's my fault
for volunteering for the show.

655
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:26,810
I walked into the water myself.

656
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:33,500
Do you know what you have to do
to not drown in water?

657
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,250
Hold your breath,

658
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:42,210
and wait quietly.

659
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:46,080
Then your body will slowly sink.
Soon, your feet will touch the bottom.

660
00:45:46,610 --> 00:45:48,850
That's when you kick yourself back up.

661
00:45:49,640 --> 00:45:51,890
You can either struggle and drown to death

662
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:54,130
or wait until you can
kick yourself back up.

663
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:57,830
The choice is yours to make.

664
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:02,670
Are you telling me
to sink deeper to the bottom?

665
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,560
Hey, that's not what I meant.

666
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:06,010
Was that not comforting either?

667
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:08,300
You and I really don't mix well.

668
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:14,060
Well, you shouldn't have to feel sorry.

669
00:46:14,330 --> 00:46:17,060
It was a reality show,
so they aired a realistic scene.

670
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:20,400
You're the only one
who gets all kinds of criticism.

671
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:25,460
This is a chance
to enjoy my temporary fame.

672
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:29,770
Back in my old job,
I used to do all the busy work

673
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:31,490
and get all my proposals stolen,

674
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:34,080
but I was still just Geun-young,
the girl with no presence.

675
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:37,300
But now, everyone knows who I am,
as the famous Geun-young.

676
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:39,230
In a way, I got my big success.

677
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:47,810
Just Geun-young.

678
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,550
Hang in a little longer, Lee Geun-young.

679
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:54,370
You'll actually miss everything
once it all passes.

680
00:46:57,620 --> 00:47:00,790
-Are you drunk?
-You always pop my bubble

681
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,620
whenever I say something nice.
Go get tested for clinical trust issues.

682
00:47:04,710 --> 00:47:06,330
It's better than being attention-needy.

683
00:47:10,870 --> 00:47:15,050
Brace yourself. This too shall pass.

684
00:47:17,110 --> 00:47:19,010
That's what you said to me.

685
00:47:24,070 --> 00:47:26,000
This too shall pass.

686
00:47:41,750 --> 00:47:44,090
(Ji-hyang)

687
00:47:57,510 --> 00:47:59,050
(Ji-hyang)

688
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:06,790
Why is he sleeping here?

689
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:10,790
Right, yesterday.

690
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:19,110
This is my spot.

691
00:48:21,050 --> 00:48:24,040
You're fast asleep.
See? It gets pretty comfy here.

692
00:48:24,350 --> 00:48:26,370
It's an oddly charming spot.

693
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:38,030
It's really hard there.

694
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:41,680
Hey.

695
00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:43,490
Hey.

696
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:27,660
(-Joon.)
-Hey, Ji-hyang.

697
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:29,420
(You aren't home. Where are you?)

698
00:49:29,510 --> 00:49:30,610
Me?

699
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:34,830
I'm working out right now. Yes.

700
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:36,500
I'll be there soon.

701
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:50,940
Do you know we have a shoot today?

702
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:52,560
You're right.

703
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:55,820
Don't be late.

704
00:49:56,610 --> 00:49:57,710
Bye.

705
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,060
-Did you drink last night?
-Me?

706
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:11,700
-No, him.
-I see.

707
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:15,220
Yes, I had a little by myself.

708
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:18,570
Are we ready to roll?

709
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:23,500
The footage you filmed yourself in Japan
wasn't enough.

710
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:27,060
Exactly. That's why I said
we can't let them go alone.

711
00:50:27,150 --> 00:50:30,100
That's why
I've been regretting my decision.

712
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:33,090
On our way here today,

713
00:50:33,180 --> 00:50:38,060
I thought of filming you two
walking down the streets of Seoul.

714
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:40,480
You two can go out wherever you want.

715
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:43,690
Are you telling us
to walk around out there?

716
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:45,850
The streets of Seoul are interesting,

717
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:47,560
and I want to see the people's reactions.

718
00:50:47,650 --> 00:50:51,740
No way. You know how they react
just by reading the comments online.

719
00:50:51,830 --> 00:50:55,000
If I... If I walk out on the streets...

720
00:50:55,090 --> 00:50:58,610
Geun-young, Who-joon is here with you.

721
00:50:58,690 --> 00:51:00,630
I'm sure people won't do anything bad.

722
00:51:01,470 --> 00:51:02,570
Or maybe they might.

723
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:06,790
I will keep her safe.

724
00:51:07,320 --> 00:51:09,870
Our cameras won't go anywhere.

725
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:12,110
We'll take a step back
and keep following you.

726
00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:13,740
You can leave when you're ready.

727
00:51:13,830 --> 00:51:15,680
-Okay. Let's have another great day.
-Geun-young.

728
00:51:15,770 --> 00:51:16,870
You can do it!

729
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:30,070
Why? Are you scared?

730
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:31,560
Then would I be excited?

731
00:51:31,650 --> 00:51:33,100
Like I said,

732
00:51:33,190 --> 00:51:36,750
you have to kick off from the bottom
if you don't want to drown.

733
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:38,820
That doesn't

734
00:51:40,050 --> 00:51:41,860
sound too comforting right now.

735
00:51:51,490 --> 00:51:54,490
-My gosh.
-This is awesome.

736
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:56,330
Can we film this?

737
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:59,410
-This is great.
-He's so hot.

738
00:51:59,500 --> 00:52:01,440
-Take his picture.
-My gosh.

739
00:52:01,970 --> 00:52:04,340
-I can't see him.
-You're so handsome.

740
00:52:10,850 --> 00:52:11,950
What do you think?

741
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:14,420
This is

742
00:52:15,430 --> 00:52:17,100
our first matching necklace.

743
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:19,040
-My gosh.
-Matching necklace?

744
00:52:21,370 --> 00:52:23,170
-I'm so jealous.
-My gosh.

745
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:24,890
I'll get it myself.

746
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:26,080
Can you see it?

747
00:52:27,570 --> 00:52:28,670
How much is this?

748
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:30,300
Thank you.

749
00:52:31,400 --> 00:52:34,260
Would you put this one on me?

750
00:52:34,830 --> 00:52:37,740
-Oh no.
-She gets to put it on him?

751
00:52:37,830 --> 00:52:39,190
No way.

752
00:52:39,410 --> 00:52:41,080
My gosh.

753
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:48,210
-I'm so jealous.
-She's so lucky.

754
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:49,570
He's so cute.

755
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:53,930
Follow them.

756
00:52:54,280 --> 00:52:55,690
This is awesome.

757
00:52:57,850 --> 00:53:00,220
-This is so awesome.
-Stop pushing.

758
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:03,170
I guess we won't be the only ones
with these necklaces.

759
00:53:03,870 --> 00:53:06,860
But still, we lost a lot of them, right?

760
00:53:07,790 --> 00:53:08,890
I guess.

761
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:12,540
I'm so glad I have you here, Who-joon.

762
00:53:21,250 --> 00:53:22,480
This is my song.

763
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:24,160
It is.

764
00:53:25,830 --> 00:53:31,200
Hey, wait.
Isn't that the singer who sang this song?

765
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:34,630
-Who-joon!
-Who-joon!

766
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:37,530
-Who-joon!
-Who-joon!

767
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:53,150
♫ In that place with no stars,
all the way in the sky ♫

768
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:57,200
♫ I always sang this song alone ♫

769
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:03,100
♫ Thinking someone might
listen to me sing one day ♫

770
00:54:03,270 --> 00:54:07,940
♫ And I sang all night long, listen ♫

771
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:15,150
♫ Once I wake up,
under the spotlight, right there ♫

772
00:54:15,420 --> 00:54:18,720
♫ That's where I'll stand ♫

773
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,270
♫ I'm your pop star ♫

774
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:33,900
♫ Remember, I'll always be
your one and only one♫

775
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:38,430
♫ I sing to let you hear my voice
all night long ♫

776
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:41,240
♫ Every day, every time ♫

777
00:54:41,330 --> 00:54:46,000
♫ If you'll listen, I'll sing ♫

778
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:49,560
♫ I'm a pop star just for you ♫

779
00:54:50,970 --> 00:54:52,770
-You're awesome!
-Thank you.

780
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:56,780
-Encore!
-Encore!

781
00:54:56,860 --> 00:54:59,150
That's all for today, though.

782
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:00,560
Thank you.

783
00:55:00,650 --> 00:55:03,550
-Who-joon, take a picture with me!
-Who-joon!

784
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:05,660
-Who-joon, just one picture!
-Give me an autograph!

785
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:08,390
Please move aside. Please move back.

786
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:10,720
-Where are you going?
-You're so handsome!

787
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:18,160
Where are you going?

788
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:45,920
You have to stop!

789
00:55:47,770 --> 00:55:50,320
-What are you doing?
-Who-joon!

790
00:55:56,350 --> 00:55:59,250
-Who-joon!
-Where are you, Who-joon?

791
00:56:13,510 --> 00:56:15,180
You've never acted before.

792
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:17,730
No, I haven't had a chance.

793
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:20,770
If you give me the chance,
I'll do my best and do well.

794
00:56:21,830 --> 00:56:25,430
But your profile is too outdated.

795
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:27,550
Ask Mr. Choi to have it changed.

796
00:56:28,730 --> 00:56:29,830
All right.

797
00:56:32,170 --> 00:56:35,420
Anyway, Mr. Choi is
running a little too late.

798
00:56:40,090 --> 00:56:42,460
Yes, Mr. Choi.
I was wondering where you were.

799
00:56:42,550 --> 00:56:46,250
Yes, Director. I'm running a little late.
What should we do?

800
00:56:46,330 --> 00:56:49,770
I have to go back to the office today.

801
00:56:50,070 --> 00:56:52,010
Okay, then. I'll call you back.

802
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:54,830
I see. Then we'll have to meet next time.

803
00:56:54,910 --> 00:56:56,670
Please do take a look at In-hyung.

804
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:57,860
(All right.)

805
00:56:59,970 --> 00:57:03,580
It sounds like he's on his way,
but I have to go now.

806
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:05,170
I see.

807
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:07,100
I'll give him a call.

808
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:08,290
Okay.

809
00:57:09,170 --> 00:57:11,460
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

810
00:57:20,430 --> 00:57:21,750
Oh, my legs.

811
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:24,880
Why did you make a run for it?
You could've just stayed.

812
00:57:24,960 --> 00:57:26,500
Do you do that to get attention?

813
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:34,380
What was the crew thinking?

814
00:57:34,470 --> 00:57:36,580
They should be thankful that
today wasn't the weekends.

815
00:57:36,670 --> 00:57:38,030
The road would've shut down.

816
00:57:38,650 --> 00:57:41,770
You're the one
who acted all cool and said okay.

817
00:57:43,310 --> 00:57:44,680
Well, I'm using this chance

818
00:57:46,170 --> 00:57:47,760
to confirm how popular I am.

819
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:53,390
People need to know
how attention-needy Who-joon is.

820
00:58:04,650 --> 00:58:06,370
Ms. No, your hair looks...

821
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:11,080
washed.

822
00:58:12,350 --> 00:58:13,450
You've done well.

823
00:58:16,750 --> 00:58:20,180
What should we do?
People suddenly swarmed in.

824
00:58:20,270 --> 00:58:22,520
The camera crew lost them,

825
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:24,140
and the microphones are also turned off.

826
00:58:27,930 --> 00:58:29,910
We'll have to call it a day, then.

827
00:58:30,790 --> 00:58:33,080
We'll wait until the cast gets here.

828
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:34,350
Please be on standby.

829
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:41,920
Is this a short shower?

830
00:58:42,010 --> 00:58:43,460
This is so sudden.

831
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:48,210
There was a time
when I used to love sudden showers.

832
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:56,530
I wonder where our ride is.

833
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:03,920
We can't stand here.

834
00:59:12,410 --> 00:59:13,510
Come at me.

835
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:17,250
I...

836
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:20,860
Let's go.

837
01:00:59,240 --> 01:00:59,300
-I invited a special guest.
-Surprise!
