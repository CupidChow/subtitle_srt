(Is Our Relationship
an Incident or an Accident?)

10
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:04,849
I want to use the bathroom.

11
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:19,110
Right. His manager told me
I should call him when something's up.

12
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:22,270
And this is definitely something.

13
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:31,380
Well, don't mind about me
and do whatever you want...

14
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,340
-He's taking a quite long bathroom break.
-Right.

(Lee Geun-young)

16
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:42,509
It must be an important call.

17
00:01:42,910 --> 00:01:46,170
If it's not too much trouble,
could I go answer this?

18
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,570
Sure. Go ahead.

19
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:48,759
Thanks.

20
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:56,420
(Can you please help me?)

21
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,400
(I'm at the penthouse right now.)

22
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,039
I'm so sorry.

23
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,640
A few crazy fans
sometimes stalk me down at home,

24
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:13,530
and I think they touched
the security system.

25
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,070
Other residents are very angry,

26
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,360
so it looks like I have to be there.

27
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,160
-I see.
-I see.

28
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,820
Okay, then. Let's call it a day.

29
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,500
-Okay.
-Great work today.

30
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:29,550
Once the dramatization is over,
I'll bring the script

31
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,570
-and make a visit.
-Thank you.

32
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,200
-See you soon.
-Okay.

33
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,120
Gosh, you need to focus. Stay focused.

34
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:44,460
How dare she tell me to come and go?

35
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,140
(The door is locked.)

36
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,450
What?

37
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:56,210
Hey!

38
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,579
Why is he here?

39
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,820
Where is she?

40
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,840
She better not be fooling around with me.

41
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:10,950
Hey, Geun-young!

42
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:13,590
Geun-young!

43
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:16,980
This is embarrassing.

44
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,090
Is she kidding me? Unbelievable.

45
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,240
Could you open the door?

46
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:30,270
Please open it.

47
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,170
You don't seem desperate.

48
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:36,870
Wait, what? Come on, please.
Open the door.

49
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,800
I really... I...

50
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:48,570
Thanks a lot. Goodbye!

51
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,110
I can't believe her.

52
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:01,590
Gosh, I almost died.

53
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,790
-My gosh.
-You're gross.

54
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,450
-What are you trying to do?
-I mean, well.

55
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,310
The production crew barged in,

56
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:12,680
so I hid, then I got locked out.

57
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,180
Hey, Ji-hyang.

58
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,079
It's not a big deal. I'll be there soon.

59
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,550
I'll tell you in person.

60
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:23,730
You.

61
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,540
I'll kill you if you get caught.

62
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:31,650
I nearly died trying not to get caught!

63
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:38,330
Shouldn't he at least ask me
if I'm all right or if I'm hurt?

64
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:40,970
He's so rude.

65
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,000
I'm hungry.

66
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:47,400
(We need some of your things
for the shooting tomorrow.)

67
00:04:47,490 --> 00:04:49,990
(Just anything you'll need
while living there.)

68
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:05,610
Hey, I guess the reality show is
real to a point.

69
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,030
They even want your stuff there.

70
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:11,470
That man is the only one
who isn't being real on that show.

71
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,960
Right, there's that thing too.

72
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:17,230
Why did he send you
a collection of biographies?

73
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,070
("Yi I", "Yi Hwang", "Jeong Yak-yong",
"Monk Wonhyo", "Aristotle", "Plato"...)

74
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:18,590
You really cause all kinds of trouble.
("Yi I", "Yi Hwang", "Jeong Yak-yong",
"Monk Wonhyo", "Aristotle", "Plato"...)

75
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:20,570
You really cause all kinds of trouble.

76
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:23,870
What's this? He really drives me crazy.

77
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,030
I guess my dad bought
something weird again.

78
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:29,550
May I just leave this here?

79
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,620
No, you can't, not in this life, never.

80
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,730
Do you want to see the room?
It's like a bookstore.

81
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,900
Well, you can go give these
to the Great Who-joon.

82
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,170
He'll like these.

83
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:40,460
Whatever.
I'll use these as trivets for ramyeon.

84
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,970
Wait, your senior only gives you ramyeon?

85
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:45,120
Are you doing okay there?

86
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:50,840
Yes, of course. She's great.

87
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:54,630
How am I going to take everything?

88
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,270
When Shin-hyuk gets here,
should I ask him to send it to you?

89
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,980
Yes, that sounds much better.

90
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:00,880
I'll pay for the shipping.

91
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,200
Okay, girl.

92
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:06,730
Sir, I just read an article
about Who-joon's variety show appearance.

93
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:09,630
He'll be appearing with the angry heel,
his official anti-fan.

94
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,740
According to my sources,
they had the first shooting.

95
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:15,970
But there was a minor car accident,
so it doesn't sound like a smooth sail.

96
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,740
Since Who-joon hasn't been
on variety shows for a while,

97
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:21,510
many people are interested
in finding out if it'll be a success.

98
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,590
-So?
-So

99
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:30,090
we wanted to look for a variety show
for you to appear in.

100
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,950
Am I Who-joon's copycat
who does everything he does?

101
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:36,870
Try to think of something
more constructive.

102
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,640
I expect a lot from you.

103
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:41,090
Yes, sir.

104
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,610
How did you feel
when you first got the offer?

105
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,440
Well, it seemed new.

106
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:51,260
Didn't you feel uncomfortable?
She's your anti-fan.

107
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:55,390
Actually, at first,
I wanted to do something with my fans.

108
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,820
Well, I guess an anti-fan is still a fan.

109
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:01,160
Anyway, forget that.

110
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,970
Once I continue to build relationships
through this program,

111
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:09,210
I thought I could learn to hold hands
with people who hate me. I had that...

112
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,980
-Expectation?
-Yes, I had that expectation.

113
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:15,810
I never wanted to seem so distant
as a celebrity.

114
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,930
I wanted to be someone
who communicates and connects

115
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,390
with people that I meet,
like a real person.

116
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,810
How do you feel after the first shooting?

117
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:28,830
I think she's the first person
who shocked me so many times in a day.

118
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,470
(What a load of bull.)

119
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:34,290
(-I hate him.)
-You're here.

120
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:36,400
Hello.

121
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:38,990
Is this everything?

122
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,670
I had them delivered.

123
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,560
I see. This is enough, I guess.

124
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:45,900
We'll start shooting after the interview.
Please get ready.

125
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,620
Come on in, Ms. Lee Geun-young.

126
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,030
-Come in.
(-Look, it's that smile.)

127
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,930
(This guy is a pro.)

128
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:22,910
(In that case...)

129
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,970
Nice to meet you.

130
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:31,530
Let's unpack our stuff first.

131
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,289
What did you bring?

132
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,650
I brought...

133
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:40,150
("Socrates")

134
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:47,900
You must love biographies.

135
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:52,690
Right. Yes. My father sent me these

136
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:56,960
to read them and become a good person,
so I've been reading them.

137
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:59,730
Have a read.
It'll help with your self-discipline.

138
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,050
Sure.

139
00:09:02,070 --> 00:09:05,410
Socrates. "Know thyself."

140
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,520
It's a great book. I'll have a read.

141
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:10,730
-I didn't bring much.
-My gosh.

142
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:15,180
I'm totally sure that woman
also isn't in her right mind.

143
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,680
I brought my guitar and letters from fans.

144
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:20,190
I've been writing songs lately,

145
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,230
so I play the tunes a little
whenever I get inspiration.

146
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:25,520
I want to play them for my fans soon.

147
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:31,410
And letters from my fans.
Whenever I get tired and weary,

148
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:35,370
reading these letters will
prop me right back up.

149
00:09:36,820 --> 00:09:39,730
I can never throw away
these hand-written letters.

150
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,630
It's my biggest treasure.

151
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,640
Awkward, isn't it?

152
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:13,430
Is there any question you have for me
or anything you wanted to say?

153
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:18,270
Right, should we eat something?

154
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,960
There's nothing to eat in...

155
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,530
this place, it seems, right?

156
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,620
The kitchen was way too clean.

157
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:32,840
Then we can just order something, right?

158
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:37,630
Since we moved in today,
let's order jjajangmyeon.

159
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,820
And I want tangsuyuk...

160
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,910
so what about you? I'll order.

161
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,100
Sure.

162
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:52,770
Well, I thought I pressed one.

163
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,610
I was going to order just one.

164
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:04,120
Geun-young, you have a knack
for throwing surprises.

165
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,490
Take a seat. Let's eat.

166
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,970
We do have something in common, though.

167
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:13,930
I really don't understand some people
who pour sauce over tangsuyuk.

168
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:17,670
Why didn't you say it sooner?

169
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,620
I'm that type who pours sauce.

170
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,910
My gosh, Geun-young is
a strange woman too.

171
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:31,620
Come to think about it,
we never got each other's number.

172
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:33,770
Could you give me your number?

173
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,750
What? Okay.

174
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:40,770
-Here.
-Okay.

175
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:51,990
(Do you want to die?)

176
00:12:02,330 --> 00:12:03,430
Enjoy.

177
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:08,530
(Why won't you text me back?)

178
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:09,810
(Will you get a grip?)
(Why won't you text me back?)

179
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:10,160
(Check your phone.)

180
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,660
(Why won't you say anything?)
(Check your phone.)

181
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:11,920
(Check your phone.)

182
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,320
(Am I in this alone?)
(Check your phone.)

183
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,290
(Am I in this alone?)

184
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:20,900
Cut. Let's go eat something too.

185
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,670
We're done for now.
Let's clean up and eat.

186
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,030
-Let's tidy up.
-Okay.

187
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,570
Do you want some...

188
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:32,730
No, we're going out to eat.
That was funny, Geun-young.

189
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:37,750
Since you already ate,
you can take a break while the crew eats.

190
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,790
Please turn off the cameras,
and we'll go to the restaurant out front.

191
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:43,160
Should we just wait here?

192
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,320
Mr. Seo, may we have a word?

193
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,570
You have Ra-ra and Kang-yeon here,
so I'll go have a talk.

194
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,380
Okay.

195
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:52,310
Let's go.

196
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,900
I'm hungry.

197
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,790
-Let's go.
-This way.

198
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,380
Check if this is turned off.

199
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,620
It's off.

200
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:07,710
Hey, you.

201
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,820
Why did you ignore my texts?

202
00:13:09,910 --> 00:13:12,160
Are we allowed to use our phones
in front of cameras?

203
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,430
I didn't know.

204
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,220
And that tangsuyuk wasn't just yours.

205
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,640
Why didn't you say
you didn't want the sauce faster?

206
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:21,920
Sorry.

207
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:26,680
Baby, Joon is like Cinderella,
so his camera magic is turned off.

208
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,660
Do you want the ones in the end

209
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:31,030
-not covered in sauce?
-It's all yours. Everything.

210
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,480
(Where is everyone?)

211
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,170
Mr. Han, what did you want to say?

212
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,240
They're here. We're over here.

213
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:43,400
-Hey.
-Hey. Over here.

214
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,370
Who-joon's staff are
in the production too.

215
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:49,780
They need to eat.

216
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,840
-I see.
-Tell me about it.

217
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:01,260
What is it? Let me watch it too.

218
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,410
-Show me. Let's watch it together.
-Hey.

219
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:09,580
What do you have here?
You're hogging it like treasure.

220
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,990
(Two-faced Who-joon)

221
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,530
How do I navigate?

222
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:21,060
So I guess you do have something hidden.

223
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:24,760
Geun-young, you are
more obscene than you look.

224
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,650
Obscene?

225
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,940
My gosh.

226
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,820
Where are you going?

227
00:14:34,210 --> 00:14:35,930
You have a huge place,
so I'm taking a tour.

228
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:38,130
Do not go up on the second floor.

229
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:41,030
What kind of obscene stuff
did you hide up there?

230
00:14:42,130 --> 00:14:43,370
Wait, hey.

231
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:03,300
Don't do it when I tell you not to.

232
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:18,920
I'm not your pet dog or cat.

233
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:29,350
-Great job, Geun-young.
-All right.

234
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:31,630
-Goodbye.
-Make sure you lock the door.

235
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,700
-Clean up everything too.
-I'll get going.

236
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:35,460
-Okay.
-Great work today.

237
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,660
-Great work.
-Great work, everyone.

238
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:41,530
("So I Married the Anti-Fan")

239
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:44,700
-Ms. No, I need you here. Hurry!
-Great work.

240
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:46,590
-Great job.
-I'm holding the elevator.

241
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,490
-We're going down.
-Come with us.

242
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:51,130
-We'll miss it.
-We're going down.

243
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:53,370
-Great job today.
-Great work.

244
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,600
I guess I'll play a game while I wait.

245
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,030
Hey, you.

246
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:44,850
You're all Who-joon's fans, aren't you?

247
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,040
Milky Way.

248
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:50,660
But I'm sorry. He already left.

249
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:54,400
Do you want me to get
his signatures on his albums?

250
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:58,000
How dare you try to make a deal
with his signature?

251
00:17:01,390 --> 00:17:02,490
Great job.

252
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,950
What the heck are you doing? Hey!

253
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:09,530
How old are you girls?

254
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:12,829
Eighteen. We're eighteen. So what?

255
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,980
I'm 27.

256
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:20,750
So what? What do you expect?

257
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:23,740
-So what?
-Who cares about your age?

258
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:24,930
Hey!

259
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,400
If you do anything weird to him,
I won't let you live.

260
00:17:34,390 --> 00:17:38,130
I almost got a heart attack
reading the newspaper, you brat.

261
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:38,440
("1st Anti-fan, Lee Geun-Young!
She Challenges Who-joon!")

262
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,500
What on earth is going on here?
("1st Anti-fan, Lee Geun-Young!
She Challenges Who-joon!")

263
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,330
What on earth is going on here?

264
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:45,350
I almost cut myself preparing namul.
You ungrateful brat.

265
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:50,230
-Let's go.
-I hate seeing her face.

266
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:52,480
Man. Look at this...

267
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:54,630
Let me go.

268
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,200
Hey, at the least,
don't take any pictures.

269
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,950
If you did, keep it within your group.
Don't upload it anywhere.

270
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,340
-Let's go.
-She's disgusting.

271
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,670
-Let me see.
-What is that?

272
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,340
-Send it to me.
-I want it too.

273
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:16,540
-I'll send it to you.
-Let me see.

274
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,080
Hey, look at this.

275
00:18:18,170 --> 00:18:21,820
Goodness.
Didn't you always tell me to come and go?

276
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:23,360
What brings you all the way here?

277
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:26,750
You must be busy working.

278
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,140
I should probably make
some herbal tonic for him.

279
00:18:31,850 --> 00:18:35,290
Hey, we just got an advertisement deal,
and we're shooting next weekend.

280
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:36,690
And advertisement? For what?

281
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:40,040
It's this coffee drink.
It's perfect for your image.

282
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:42,810
But he has to go to Japan
for the shooting.

283
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:44,920
Ji-hyang, can he make time?

284
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:47,390
I can talk to the variety show crew.

285
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:49,150
Okay.

286
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:59,490
It's a product for SP Group?

287
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:02,130
Why? Because it's JJ's family?

288
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:05,780
Don't mind him.
They practically shunned him anyway.

289
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:08,240
Come on.
Can you at least be nicer with your words?

290
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:10,090
We're here by ourselves.

291
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:13,700
Does it make you feel better
when you say things you don't mean?

292
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:16,070
Don't act like you're nice around me.
That's so not you.

293
00:19:17,830 --> 00:19:21,220
Really? Then I should
start saying everything I want,

294
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,850
both on TV and to you.

295
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,920
Gosh, you and your temper.

296
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:28,570
We do millions of things in this industry
against our will.

297
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:29,980
And remember.

298
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:33,410
When someone is shunned by the family,
they'll be treated as such elsewhere.

299
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:39,310
It sounds like you're telling me
to be careful not to get shunned.

300
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:41,240
Why do you take it that way?

301
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:42,430
Are you that narrow-minded?

302
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,600
I have to go do some business.

303
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:48,020
Make sure you figure out his schedule.

304
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:51,360
And get some sleep whenever you can.
Your health is the most important.

305
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:52,730
I'll see him off.

306
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:54,530
Bye.

307
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:55,890
Goodbye.

308
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,730
-Jae-joon.
-Hey.

309
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:20,090
Joon.

310
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:23,740
-My dad is going to make an agency for me.
-What?

311
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:26,600
Come with me once I go independent.

312
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,700
You'll come, right?

313
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:37,120
Well, hey.

314
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:40,950
I don't think I can do that.

315
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,730
After all, Young-suk is
the guy who brought me to Korea.

316
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:49,040
And he did so much for me.

317
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:00,840
Then... Then what about
everything I did for you?

318
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,330
Don't say that.

319
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,840
That's a little different.

320
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,030
Is it?

321
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,700
So you think you're a big shot.

322
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,730
What's wrong, Jae-joon? It's not like you.

323
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:18,920
What?

324
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,820
What do you think I'm like?

325
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:25,390
A guy who keeps associating with you
even after you take all my songs?

326
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,870
Do whatever you want.

327
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:35,380
In-hyung is leaving with me.

328
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,900
She said she'll leave?

329
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:47,700
Do you think she wants to stay here?

330
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,130
He keeps saying he'll let her debut,
but he keeps putting it off.

331
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,840
Once she finds out what you're saying,

332
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,270
how do you think she'll respond?

333
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,140
You're right.

334
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:05,910
Jae-joon.

335
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,120
Please

336
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:12,510
treat her well.

337
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:17,090
And make sure you let her debut.

338
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:22,760
I hope you get your big break too.

339
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:24,430
After that, the three of us can...

340
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,710
Darn it.

341
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:29,760
Darn it, man.

342
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:32,930
You're one selfish jerk.

343
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:58,620
-My gosh.
-I'm sorry.

344
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:59,810
What is that?

345
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,390
Exactly. What is all this?

346
00:23:10,770 --> 00:23:12,790
She always calls when I'm busy.

347
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:16,790
Mom, I'm busy. I'll call you back.

348
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:19,790
What? You really got another job?

349
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:21,330
Yes, of course.

350
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:24,670
-Did you eat something?
(-I already ate.)

351
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:28,630
Okay, then.
Make sure you don't skip a meal.

352
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:31,450
Okay. Don't worry.

353
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:35,540
All right. Okay.

354
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:36,730
Bye.

355
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:39,800
Make sure she reads "Aristotle."

356
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,220
You hung up.

357
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,350
My gosh. She always calls me
when I'm swamped.

358
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:10,820
Hey, they just want anybody
for the advertisement.

359
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,580
In-hyung, are you done practicing?

360
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:15,360
Hey, who should I recommend?

361
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,270
Just send anybody who wants to go.
Why are you worried?

362
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,820
Everyone would want an ad gig.

363
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,600
On top of that,
they'll be doing it with Who-joon.

364
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:28,340
If they'll be doing this with Who-joon,
shouldn't Mr. Choi decide?

365
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,180
Mr. Choi?

366
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,820
-Really?
-I'll do it.

367
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,700
-What?
-You said they wanted anybody.

368
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:40,920
Then shouldn't the agency
send their oldest trainee?

369
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:44,480
Well, I guess that's not a bad idea.

370
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,680
You went shopping?

371
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:06,840
You must be having a good life.

372
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,740
I bought these
because I couldn't make a living.

373
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:12,420
That house was like a model home.
There's nothing there.

374
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,570
Wait, did you completely disregard
what the house looks like?

375
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:20,870
-Is this to show people you live here?
-They're pretty enough.

376
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:28,180
Did you buy those out of need?
I should've bought some for you.

377
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:30,900
Don't say that.
I should at least get these.

378
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:32,530
-Let's go, then.
-Okay.

379
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,820
Joon, let's go upstairs.

380
00:25:40,230 --> 00:25:41,330
Let's go.

381
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:46,390
What? Did he suddenly hurt his foot?

382
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:49,120
Did he trip or something?

383
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,650
Please get it ready in there.

384
00:25:55,590 --> 00:25:56,820
-Hello.
-Hello.

385
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,500
Mr. Han, Who-joon is here.

386
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,020
What happened?

387
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:07,380
Oh no.

388
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:10,410
-Did you get hurt?
-I sprained it during practice.

389
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:13,450
-I'm sorry about my leg.
-Goodness.

390
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,770
It's all right.

391
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,690
You have your wife here.
Why are you worried?

392
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:33,160
Geun-young, I'm so sorry.

393
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:34,830
I'm thirsty. Could you get me some water?

394
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,290
Okay, sure.

395
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:47,680
Thank you so much, Geun-young.
What would I do without you?

396
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:49,930
Don't mention it.

397
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,770
Whoa. My goodness.

398
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:56,920
Man, I'm so out of it.

399
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:59,340
Did I break the camera?

400
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:03,210
I'm sorry, but can you grab
some towel or tissue?

401
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:04,490
Sure.

402
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:08,100
My gosh, this is bad.

403
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:10,470
-I'm sorry, Geun-young.
-Don't mention it.

404
00:27:11,310 --> 00:27:14,080
I'll sorry. I'll take that. Let me do it.

405
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:17,340
I've been so out of it lately.

406
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:20,330
(Could he be... No, I doubt it.)

407
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,630
I spilled water all over the floor too.

408
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,090
-What should I do?
-I'll... I'll do it.

409
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,860
I'm sorry to put you through
so much trouble.

410
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,750
What can you do? You're hurt.

411
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,330
There's more down there.

412
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:38,150
Okay. Goodness, you spilled a lot.

413
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,680
I'm not doing too well today.

414
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,700
I hope you get well soon.

415
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:47,960
Then why don't we watch some TV?

416
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:50,200
Where's the remote control?

417
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:51,920
(This punk.)

418
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,750
The remote control is over there.

419
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:59,880
-It's close by, so...
-No, don't.

420
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:02,920
Thank you, really.

421
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:06,130
Should we watch a movie?
We can watch movies on this TV.

422
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:08,770
Let's eat cake and watch a movie.
I know this great place.

423
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:11,940
Gosh, but I sprained my foot. Man.

424
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,490
I can't do a thing.

425
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:17,530
(-He came with a plan, didn't he?)
-I can't do anything.

426
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,140
-I'll get it.
-What?

427
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,520
-Give me the address.
-She's clenching her teeth.

428
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,740
One of you can follow her.
And a camera too.

429
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:42,390
Goodness, long time no see.

430
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:49,560
Are you shooting the show right now?

431
00:28:49,650 --> 00:28:52,550
Who-joon loves the cake here.
Are you getting some for him?

432
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,790
Since you're his personal reporter,
you seem to know everything.

433
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,250
I heard you were very offended.

434
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:03,510
Please do understand.
You were a reporter, so you'd know.

435
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,310
I wasn't like you.

436
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,110
Why are you so inflexible?

437
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:10,550
Honestly speaking,
you're on TV now out of need,

438
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:12,390
and you're using him in a way.

439
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,640
-What?
-Here's your order.

440
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,520
I look forward
to reading an interesting article.

441
00:29:19,830 --> 00:29:22,870
Don't grow weary,
and make sure you take these.

442
00:29:22,950 --> 00:29:25,110
Goodbye, then.

443
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:28,500
May I have one coffee?

444
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:30,570
He stabs me, then butters me up.

445
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:32,330
Did these expire?

446
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,360
I take those at home.

447
00:29:35,890 --> 00:29:38,400
Peach tart. I'll take a peach tart.

448
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:48,080
(More Beautiful Than Flowers)

449
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:51,420
They do look good.

450
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:56,310
Geun-young.

451
00:29:56,610 --> 00:29:59,830
We'll start shooting
as you walk in with cake and beverages.

452
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:01,320
Okay.

453
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:03,300
Do we have some beverages ready?

454
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:05,020
Yes, we do.

455
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,040
These.

456
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,960
-This is it?
-Yes, we only had these.

457
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:12,450
-Vita-Vita.
-Vita-Vita.

458
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,820
These are fine.

459
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:15,140
Okay, we'll go with these.

460
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:17,210
If you're ready, let's roll.

461
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:18,530
You can get these ready,

462
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:21,210
then bring out the cake and beverages.

463
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,710
-Okay.
-Okay.

464
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,630
Let's get ready.

465
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:30,410
He must be working hard.

466
00:30:58,170 --> 00:31:01,340
-Let's share.
-I'm fine. You can eat it.

467
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,330
This place makes delicious cakes.

468
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:11,850
I should've bought some more.

469
00:31:11,940 --> 00:31:14,230
It would've been great
if our crew could join us.

470
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:30,160
This is so good. You should have some.

471
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:33,020
I don't feel like eating cake.

472
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,670
Why do I feel so weird?

473
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:55,190
-What's wrong?
-My stomach suddenly...

474
00:31:57,660 --> 00:31:59,330
Celebrities use the toilet too.

475
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,310
You don't have to beat around the bush.

476
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,630
Let's go.

477
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:07,910
-Are you okay?
-What's wrong?

478
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,010
-What?
-Joon, are you okay?

479
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,420
-Are you all right?
-What's wrong?

480
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,180
-Joon.
-What's going on?

481
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:14,160
-Who-joon.
-Can you get an ambulance?

482
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,800
-Wait, we'll stop here.
-Get an ambulance now!

483
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,160
-Call 911.
-Call 911.

484
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:19,880
-Call 911.
-Get him here.

485
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,960
-Was something wrong with the cake?
-What's going on?

486
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,850
Where's the camera? Rewind everything.

487
00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:26,210
Did you catch anything?

488
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:29,030
We couldn't film anything in there,
so we only got the store shot.

489
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,540
Then was something in the beverage?

490
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:34,180
-Did you have a sip?
-I haven't.

491
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:35,500
Why didn't you check?

492
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:38,530
-What did you do with those drinks?
-I'm sorry.

493
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:41,080
-You idiot!
-Hey, stop that.

494
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:43,500
-You're a scumbag. Get out.
-Stop that.

495
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:44,950
You're useless. Get out of here.

496
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:46,490
-Get out. Go.
-I'm sorry.

497
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,900
Get out, you idiot.

498
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:49,270
-Oh no.
-Get out!

499
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:52,610
-Get out of here!
-What are we going to do? Goodness.

500
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,590
-You're a scumbag!
-It was me.

501
00:32:57,670 --> 00:33:01,320
Well, it wasn't his fault,
and the beverage was fine.

502
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:03,430
But I put something in there.

503
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,650
Well, I had vitamin packets,
and they seemed a bit old.

504
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:09,200
Are you okay? My gosh.

505
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:19,270
Do you think she'll fall for this?

506
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:21,520
The trick is to make her fall for it.

507
00:33:21,610 --> 00:33:24,690
Once you drink the beverage she brings,
and fall down,

508
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:27,150
-she'll have to fall for it.
-Of course.

509
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,220
She'll totally fall for it.

510
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:30,930
She will.

511
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:35,110
That was a prank cam.

512
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:44,840
-One second, please.
-Okay.

513
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,820
Geun-young, one second.

514
00:33:52,270 --> 00:33:55,660
You should probably go home now.

515
00:33:56,100 --> 00:34:00,590
You must've hated him so much
that you wanted to kill him.

516
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:03,450
No, I'm sorry. I'm bad at empty talks.

517
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,900
Is he okay?

518
00:34:04,990 --> 00:34:08,030
Of course. This was a prank cam.

519
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:13,170
On me?

520
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,929
We pulled a prank on you.

521
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:16,469
My gosh, this is embarrassing.

522
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:22,679
-Okay.
-Mr. Han.

523
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:24,880
Prank cam, success!

524
00:34:24,969 --> 00:34:28,000
-Oh no.
-Do you have to take your stuff?

525
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:29,889
Nothing in particular.

526
00:34:36,889 --> 00:34:39,130
Hey, look at you.

527
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:42,080
This girl has pretty makeup on.

528
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:46,350
Give me a drink.
I'll only end up shaming myself.

529
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,540
Why?

530
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:55,590
No, you won't understand how I feel.

531
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:56,780
How do you feel?

532
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,670
Did you get us gifts after you got paid?

533
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:06,900
Red ginseng?

534
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:10,720
Hey, this is for women.
It's for this part-timer.

535
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:12,750
Thanks, my friend.
I'll make sure I eat it.

536
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:19,440
Here.

537
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:27,270
She's going to make me sick.
What's with her again?

538
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:30,130
She said we won't understand.

539
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,520
She thinks she's a big shot now.

540
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,700
Hey.

541
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:36,680
Geun-young, cheer up.

542
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:39,190
Your presence has been huge.

543
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,960
My seniors are
dying to hear more about you.

544
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:43,770
-Really?
-Look at her.

545
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:46,720
She cares so much
about what the public thinks.

546
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,260
She thinks she's a celebrity.

547
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:50,240
Whatever, I'm in trouble.

548
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,880
I get enough awful comments already.

549
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,310
Once the show goes on air, I'll be
treated like an idiot and a criminal.

550
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,120
What about Who-joon's anti-fan union?

551
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:04,620
My friends,
do you want to start uploading comments?

552
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:05,860
What do you want me to say?

553
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:08,230
"I saw Lee Geun-young in real life,
and she's a goddess."

554
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,740
What? What's with you?

555
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:14,880
No, this time, I was pretty cheap.

556
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:42,110
What do you think?

557
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:46,510
I like it.

558
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:48,180
Of course, you do.

559
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:52,490
Anyway, I saw your foot. What happened?

560
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:54,120
-My foot?
-Your foot.

561
00:36:56,450 --> 00:37:00,460
This? I sprained my foot,
but I'm fine now.

562
00:37:00,550 --> 00:37:04,730
Be careful. Your body
doesn't just belong to you. You know that.

563
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:24,480
(Stranger)

564
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,580
Can you do me a favor?
(Stranger)

565
00:37:39,270 --> 00:37:43,050
I wasn't going to do anything like that.
Why did I do that?

566
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,390
It's because I ran into that reporter.

567
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:58,540
Mr. Seo, it's me, Geun-young.

568
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:01,750
May I ask you for a favor?

569
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,990
It's late. Go home.

570
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:53,230
He left the recording studio,
so he should be home by now.

571
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,550
You aren't coming with me?

572
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:58,680
I'm sure he knows
you didn't mean to harm him.

573
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:00,530
Good luck.

574
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,860
Thank you.

575
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:04,800
Go on.

576
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:59,450
Don't you feel awkward being here?

577
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:03,360
I don't want us to feel awkward.

578
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:04,550
Fine.

579
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:07,810
I don't feel awkward either, then.

580
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:11,240
Okay.

581
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:15,420
I was worried you might've been hurt.

582
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,840
I'm going to start over.

583
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:19,990
I'll start performing again too.

584
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:21,360
I was there

585
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:25,100
when you had your debut celebration.

586
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:29,100
That's why I couldn't say anything.

587
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,020
I turned away like an idiot.

588
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:38,340
Things were really tough for me.

589
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:42,790
And you made me lonely.

590
00:40:44,330 --> 00:40:45,430
I know.

591
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:49,250
I know I made you feel lonely.

592
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:52,330
I couldn't stop you
from leaving the agency,

593
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:54,970
and I couldn't help you when you debuted.

594
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:57,090
But next to you, you always had...

595
00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:04,080
Don't mind me.

596
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:08,260
Just be confident.

597
00:41:11,870 --> 00:41:15,480
-No, I do feel confident.
-Don't go around with that fake look.

598
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:20,980
And start telling JJ
what you want or don't want to do.

599
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:26,650
And stop wearing an awkward dress
or a hairpin like these.

600
00:42:42,510 --> 00:42:44,050

Wait, hey. What are you doing?

603
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:08,970
That was shocking.

604
00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:16,490
What are you looking for?

605
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:20,710
I...

606
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,650
I came to apologize.

607
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:31,890
It's about that drink.

608
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:35,320
I really wasn't planning on doing that.

609
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:37,480
I just did it as a joke...

610

pull a prank like that again

You need to stop fooling me.

614

Why did you order me around?

Man, I'm too curious to fall asleep.

617

Who was that woman?

618

it'd be a huge scoop.

00:47:13,590 --> 00:47:15,040
Geun-young, here's your coffee.

639
00:47:15,130 --> 00:47:16,980
-Thanks.
-Here.

640
00:47:17,060 --> 00:47:18,160
Thanks for the coffee.

641
00:47:22,470 --> 00:47:23,570
And

642
00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:26,650
ta-da.

643
00:47:27,530 --> 00:47:29,730
I finally get to return this to the owner.

644
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:33,690
It's my shoe. You really had it.

645
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:37,300
Anyway, your feet seem to be
bigger than I thought.

646
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:39,460
Right, yes.

647
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:42,710
I'm pretty tall.

648
00:47:44,030 --> 00:47:47,910
Geun-young, do you know
what I had on my mind when I picked it up?

649
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:53,320
I thought this shoe deserves to be
evidence of a historical event.

650
00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:56,050
Goodness, what historical event?

651
00:47:56,130 --> 00:47:59,830
I don't think you realize
what you're like.

652
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:03,440
Do you know what popped into my head
when I found out you were a reporter?

653
00:48:04,270 --> 00:48:08,890
"We still have a reporter who can say
what she needs to say to a top star."

654
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:13,070
No, you didn't just say it.
You threw a shoe at him too.

655
00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:18,440
I wouldn't be sitting here today
if it hadn't been for this shoe.

656
00:48:18,530 --> 00:48:21,170
Hey, don't lose your spirit again.

657
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:26,360
What's important is that
you spotted his true nature.

658
00:48:28,610 --> 00:48:31,820
So has Who-joon, how can I put this?

659
00:48:31,910 --> 00:48:35,510
Has he always had so many secrets?

660
00:48:35,870 --> 00:48:38,950
Why? Is something bothering you?

661
00:48:40,050 --> 00:48:41,720
By any chance, a long time ago...

662
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,850
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay. Go ahead.

663
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:51,440
-Hello?
-Mr. Choi.

664
00:48:51,570 --> 00:48:54,390
We just got a call from SP Group.

665
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,290
(It's not a huge role,
but they need a female model for an ad.)

666
00:48:57,380 --> 00:49:01,430
If it's for an advertisement, send one.
You can manage this by yourself, right?

667
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,230
Yes, but the partner is...

668
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:07,980
A competent employee like you
shouldn't depend only on the CEO.

669
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:11,020
I expect a lot from all of you.

670
00:49:11,640 --> 00:49:12,780
Please make it work.

671
00:49:12,870 --> 00:49:14,140
Yes, sir.

672
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:21,010
-You should take the ad gig.
-I should.

673
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:24,790
We can just do it,
but my agency always needs me.

674
00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:30,030
Anyway, you were saying...

675
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:31,790
No, it's nothing.

676
00:49:32,180 --> 00:49:35,180
Did you want to see me
to return this shoe?

677
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:39,440
Yes, that too,
but I also wanted to make you an offer.

678
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:44,280
Isn't it tiring to go to the shooting
with all of your stuff?

679
00:49:44,370 --> 00:49:46,840
Oh, this? Actually, I...

680
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:48,380
Will you consider signing with me?

681
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:50,400
What? Me?

682
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:57,480
My gosh, that was funny.
Jae-joon, you were a funny guy.

683
00:49:57,570 --> 00:49:59,160
That's absurd.

684
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:03,340
Why not?
You're now an entertainer who'll be on TV.

685
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:06,640
You need an agency
to not get involved in anything unfair.

686
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,880
I mean, they're all on Who-joon's side.

687
00:50:08,970 --> 00:50:12,400
Do you trust the network people
or Who-joon's staff?

688
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,790
Everyone is nice to me.

689
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:21,160
Anyway,

690
00:50:22,210 --> 00:50:24,540
I'm serious about this offer.

691
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:26,300
Please think it over.

692
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:31,410
Okay, fine.
I'll give it a serious thought.

693
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:07,000
Who is it?

694
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:08,980
I'll leave the parcel out front.

695
00:51:09,070 --> 00:51:10,430
I didn't order anything.

696
00:51:11,530 --> 00:51:12,630
What's going on?

697
00:51:27,550 --> 00:51:28,910
(To: Who-joon)

698
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:45,500
(Who-joon wants to invite you
to a fancy restaurant today.)

699
00:51:46,070 --> 00:51:50,030
(I sent you the address,
but we can meet up before you go.)

700
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:51,710
(You said you're bad with directions.)

701
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:56,630
It's all wrinkly.

702
00:51:58,830 --> 00:52:00,590
This cost me a fortune.

703
00:52:14,450 --> 00:52:17,360
How fancy of a restaurant will he take me
to make me lose my spirit?

704
00:52:21,670 --> 00:52:23,690
-Here.
-Thank you.

705
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:25,150
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

706
00:52:27,430 --> 00:52:27,700
(Clean House)

707
00:52:27,700 --> 00:52:30,430
I can't believe I get to wear this again.
(Clean House)

708
00:52:30,430 --> 00:52:30,870
(Clean House)

709
00:52:30,870 --> 00:52:34,690
See? It wasn't a total waste of money.
(Clean House)

710
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:56,160
Did I keep you waiting?

711
00:52:56,470 --> 00:52:57,570
Come on in.

712
00:53:00,870 --> 00:53:02,060
I made you some food.

713
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:03,640
Sounds great.

714
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:13,280
(Geun-young, you're so pathetic.)

715
00:53:14,690 --> 00:53:17,940
So this was the fancy restaurant?

716
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:22,740
I know I have no sense of direction,
but how could I not know?

717
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:27,360
No, that jerk can't see me in these shoes.

718
00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:28,550
No, that can't happen.

719
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:32,680
Geun-young!
What's wrong? Why aren't you going in?

720
00:53:32,770 --> 00:53:34,090
Is this it?

721
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:37,790
-Yes, you know who Chef Roy is, right?
-I do.

722
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:40,780
He's the biggest celebrity chef now.

723
00:53:40,870 --> 00:53:42,800
And he's close to Who-joon too.

724
00:53:43,770 --> 00:53:46,680
I wonder what he's like. Let's go inside.

725
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:48,220
What? Wait.

726
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:51,300
-Anyway, are your shoes too big?
-Right? I should get changed.

727
00:53:51,430 --> 00:53:54,900
-No, those look great.
-No wait. Let me get changed.

728
00:53:54,990 --> 00:53:57,320
No, your shoes are fine.

729
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:00,710
Hello.

730
00:54:00,890 --> 00:54:02,250
Hello.

731
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:04,230
-Ms. No, you're here.
-Hey, rookie.

732
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:06,080
-Hello, Who-joon.
-Hello.

733
00:54:06,170 --> 00:54:07,400
You're here.

734
00:54:07,490 --> 00:54:11,620
Geun-young, you look
completely different today.

735
00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:13,470
-Isn't she pretty?
-Yes.

736
00:54:13,870 --> 00:54:15,140
-You look great.
-What is this?

737
00:54:15,230 --> 00:54:18,090
She looks perfect for this dinner.
Don't you think so, Who-joon?

738
00:54:18,270 --> 00:54:19,370
Sorry?

739
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:22,010
Yes, right.

740
00:54:22,450 --> 00:54:25,660
Who-joon, so are we going to see
the celebrity chef too?

741
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:26,850
Yes, of course.

742
00:54:27,770 --> 00:54:29,050
He should be here soon.

743
00:54:31,030 --> 00:54:32,390
There he is.

744
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:37,540
Long time no see.

745
00:54:41,410 --> 00:54:43,300
(What are those men doing?)

746
00:54:44,750 --> 00:54:47,260
-Thank you for your cooperation.
-Nice to meet you.

747
00:54:47,350 --> 00:54:49,420
-Hello.
-Nice to meet you.

748
00:54:49,990 --> 00:54:52,060
This is our heroine.

749
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:00,460
The heroine.

750
00:55:05,650 --> 00:55:08,070
Nice to meet you. I'm Roy.

751
00:55:12,610 --> 00:55:15,380
I see. Sure. Nice to meet you.

752
00:55:19,730 --> 00:55:21,540
Okay, then. See you later.

753
00:55:21,630 --> 00:55:22,950
Okay, see you.

754
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,710
Then I'll get ready too.

755
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:26,690
-Hey, rookie.
-Yes, sir.

756
00:55:38,390 --> 00:55:42,700
Actually, this is my first time
cooking for someone.

757
00:55:42,790 --> 00:55:44,240
I see.

758
00:55:45,740 --> 00:55:49,130
I'm trying this for the first time
only for you, Geun-young.

759
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:52,290
Do you see that guy over there?

760
00:55:53,090 --> 00:55:54,630
Yes, I can see him clearly.

761
00:55:54,710 --> 00:55:57,530
He's going to help me out today.

762
00:55:58,410 --> 00:55:59,690
I heard you two are close.

763
00:55:59,770 --> 00:56:01,800
Then give me a moment.

764
00:56:01,890 --> 00:56:02,990
Sure.

765
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:12,180
-What should I do now?
-Okay.

766
00:56:12,270 --> 00:56:13,550
Season this.

767
00:56:15,220 --> 00:56:16,410
Is that too much?

768
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:21,950
You got nothing more to learn.

769
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:29,960
(Come to think about it, he's about
the same height as that foreign guy.)

770
00:56:35,940 --> 00:56:39,720
(Come to think about it,
Who-joon lived abroad too.)

771
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:43,990
Are you saving my clothes?
It's fine. This outfit is mine.

772
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:47,290
(They are way too touchy-feely too.)

773
00:56:47,510 --> 00:56:48,610
Thanks.

774
00:56:49,050 --> 00:56:50,770
You have to look pretty on TV.

775
00:56:51,030 --> 00:56:53,940
-Let me fix your hair.
(-My goodness.)

776
00:56:54,020 --> 00:56:55,650
It's almost ready.

777
00:56:57,370 --> 00:57:02,380
(I couldn't tell anyone that I've met
two of my ex-boyfriend's boyfriends.)

778
00:57:05,770 --> 00:57:08,720
I tried my best,
but I'm not sure how good it'll be.

779
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:10,660
He's a good chef, after all.

780
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:12,020
Sorry?

781
00:57:12,990 --> 00:57:14,090
Nothing.

782
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:16,420
That's his favorite dish.

783
00:57:20,950 --> 00:57:23,860
It's made with a precious mushroom
called truffle.

784
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:26,140
This is truffle pasta made with truffles.

785
00:57:26,670 --> 00:57:29,530
That's his favorite
among all of my dishes.

786
00:57:29,930 --> 00:57:32,740
-It's great.
-Have you had it?

787
00:57:33,670 --> 00:57:36,400
His truffle pasta will be
different from anything you had.

788
00:57:36,970 --> 00:57:39,340
You didn't know he's a foodie, did you?

789
00:57:39,430 --> 00:57:40,880
Is that so?

790
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:45,680
I guess only close friends would know.
Because I didn't.

791
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:49,110
I only helped out a little,
but please try some.

792
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:50,700
I will.

793
00:57:55,050 --> 00:57:56,240
Get that on camera.

794
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:07,240
Gosh, this is so good.

795
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:12,260
Well, figures.

796
00:58:14,150 --> 00:58:17,930
People say there is no such thing
as bad truffle pasta.

797
00:58:18,330 --> 00:58:19,820
Wait, maybe that's not it.

798
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:22,290
Was it not pasta? Was it tteokbokki?

799
00:58:26,690 --> 00:58:28,490
-Let me pick it up.
-No.

800
00:58:29,990 --> 00:58:31,090
Goodness.

801
00:58:33,240 --> 00:58:34,520
Let me get it.

802
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:43,100
Will you be quiet?

803
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:44,420
What did I do?

804
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:59,420
-How was that?
-Great.

805
00:58:59,510 --> 00:59:00,920
Ms. No is happy too. Okay.

806
00:59:01,010 --> 00:59:03,650
-Great job.
-Great work.

807
00:59:09,370 --> 00:59:12,970
Are they using this TV shooting and me
as a chance to show off their romance?

808
00:59:15,350 --> 00:59:16,450
So annoying.

809
00:59:23,050 --> 00:59:24,150
Geun-young.

810
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:26,920
Yes, Chef. What is it?

811
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:29,830
I thought it'd be better
if I pretended like we're strangers.

812
00:59:31,230 --> 00:59:33,830
I didn't realize how considerate you were.

813
00:59:34,180 --> 00:59:35,280
What's wrong?

814
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:37,970
You're still not over that?

815
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:40,120
Not over what?

816
00:59:40,430 --> 00:59:42,060
You said you'd be patient with me.

817
00:59:45,400 --> 00:59:47,600
I can't believe this.

818
00:59:48,130 --> 00:59:50,460
Do you know
what makes me even more furious?

819
00:59:50,550 --> 00:59:52,130
If you're that close to Who-joon,

820
00:59:52,220 --> 00:59:54,470
you would've known I was coming here.

821
00:59:54,550 --> 00:59:57,190
Did you have to make me
run into you like this?

822
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:58,910
I didn't think so much about it.

823
00:59:59,390 --> 01:00:00,710
I didn't know you'd be this angry.

824
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:02,740
Don't use your ignorance as a weapon.

825
01:00:06,430 --> 01:00:08,630
-Geun-young.
-Stop calling me!

826
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:10,920
But you didn't throw away the shoes.

827
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:17,040
Yes, those were limited-edition.
It'd be a shame to throw them away.

828
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:18,220
Okay?

829
01:00:22,580 --> 01:00:25,660
What's going on? You two were acquainted?

830
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:29,000
Hey, Who-joon. It's nothing.
Don't mind it.

831
01:00:41,370 --> 01:00:43,300
So you two know each other?

832
01:01:16,220 --> 01:01:16,390
(Is this the infamous evil editing?)
