What's with me?

it was a prank by tomorrow.

I can't believe
he played with my heart to the end.

I was pulling a prank?

Which means you people want to see it.

00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,930
Everyone at the TV station
can be very cruel, right?

39
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:21,790
It's already a surprise
that Who-joon offered to return,

40
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,680
but we're also shooting here
of all places.

41
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:25,930
I thought you'd find this cruel.

42
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,960
Anyway, why did Who-joon
suddenly change his mind?

43

44

How would I know?

45
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,930
You're really weird too.

46
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:35,470
Well, figures.

47
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:41,280
Anyway, won't people at this magazine be
shocked to see you as well?

48
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:44,930
At this point, aren't you the one
who's closer to Who-joon?

49
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:47,350
What do you mean we're friends?

50
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,909
I didn't say you two are friends.

51
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:53,430
Did you finish your homework?

52
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:58,130
Didn't you say Who-joon feels like
a homework that's left undone?

53
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:01,350
It still feels like that. He feels undone.
And that's not all.

54
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:04,650
I just can't get closer
to a guy like Who-joon.

55
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:10,590
Just think of this magazine publisher
as an undone homework too.

56
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:11,770
Let's go inside.

57

What's with the crowd out there?

58

Hey, that's not what's important.

61
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:28,320
Who-joon is going to be here.
That's why we're making a huge fuss.

-Yes.

we're about to redecorate the whole place.

out of this office too.

Let's reconsider
after we debut another rookie.

why did you agree to the advertisement?

I haven't brought up
what happened in Japan until now.

78

Don't you think?

79

Do you know how many years
I've stayed quiet like this?

80
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,620
Now you're telling me to wait again?

81

never really went well with me.

No, it doesn't make me uncomfortable.

00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,010
(Time-slip? Time-slim!)

163
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:44,360
That's my...
(Time-slip? Time-slim!)

164
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,460
That's my...

165
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,250
-Isn't this my...
-The pictorial

166
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:56,820
will look like you're doing a time-slip
between your fancy life on stage

167
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,660
and your simple life off-stage,

168
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:01,660
to show the story
of your two different sides.

169
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,780
What do you think, Geun-young?

170
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,730
You used to be an editor as well.

171
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,490
I want to know what you think.

172
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:13,760
What's important is what you think.

173
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:16,660
If you like it,
we'd like to go ahead and do this.

174
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:18,550
It's fine by me,

175
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,240
but Geun-young's opinion is
very important to me too.

176
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,520
Geun-young, what do you think?

177
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:32,240
Geun-young, you can tell me.

178
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,400
I...

179
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,140
I don't like it.

180
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:51,240
Let's stop here.

181
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:53,270
You just need
a few more insert shots, right?

182
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,420
Yes, right. One second.

183
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:58,680
-I'll talk to them.
-Excuse me.

184
00:12:04,970 --> 00:12:06,640
Let's do as you say, Who-joon.

185
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:08,620
We'll be back for the shooting anyway.

186
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:11,170
Production crew, let's have a talk.

187
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:16,010
Have you gone insane?

188
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:17,860
How could you do this?

189
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:20,550
Why would you want to use
my proposal here?

190
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:21,780
Don't get delusional.

191
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:24,730
You're the one who left like that
and brought shame to our magazine.

192
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:28,290
You should be grateful
I treated you like that

193
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,930
in front of those cameras.

194
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,510
But you dare defy me?

195
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,330
Don't you get how I held back
because you were on camera as well?

196
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:38,850
You just...
You just had to say you're sorry.

197
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:41,710
Shut your mouth.
Now you're even talking back at me.

198
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:43,120
You're a big girl now, aren't you?

199
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:45,270
You used to obey everything I said
when you were here.

200
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:49,760
Why? Do you think you've become somebody
now that you associate with a celebrity?

201
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:54,950
I think so. You seemed to be on edge
as soon as you saw me.

202
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,070
I guess I'm not as petty as I was before.

203
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,250
What?

204
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,550
All this just because
I'm not your boss anymore.

205
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,230
Do you think I'm a joke?

206
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:05,820
You've become very wicked
after you hit your rock bottom.

207
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,360
Does this look like my rock bottom?

208
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,090
Then you'll be even more shocked
when I jump back up.

209
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,340
You know what?

210
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:18,540
You look ridiculous right now.

211
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:21,620
You probably fear nothing
now that Who-joon lets you talk to him

212
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:23,420
and hang around with you.

213
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:26,850
That's why you're Just Geun-young.

214
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,920
Who-joon embracing his anti-fan?

215
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:30,590
So you're doing a show with him?

216
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:33,450
You don't actually believe that, do you?

217
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:36,400
I hope you aren't that big of an idiot.

218
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:40,270
If your junior is such an idiot

219
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:43,750
that she put on a smile to do a TV show
with a woman who fired her,

220
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:47,580
it would've been better
if you showed me remorse and support.

221
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,360
Do you have to be
so sarcastic and aggressive?

222
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,450
Then let's continue
to discuss the pictorial.

223
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:04,430
I gave this a thought,

224
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:07,730
and I really don't like this theme.

225
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,040
Let's call this off.

226
00:14:15,820 --> 00:14:16,920
Let's go.

227
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:18,600
Why?

228
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,960
What are you doing? Let's go.

229
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,320
What's with you?

230
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,600
You've read the articles, right?

231
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,230
That my anti-fan will be

232
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,970
embraced by me.

233
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:33,910
Do you know why?

234
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,420
Because no matter how much she hates me,

235
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,970
she never steals anything.

236
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:41,610
On top of that,
when she does something wrong,

237
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,160
she knows when to apologize.

238
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:47,640
It seems like
you're Geun-young's anti-fan.

239
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,670
If you bow and apologize properly,
I might give it another thought.

240
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,800
Let's go.

241
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,420
Everyone, gather around.

242
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:24,990
Go make new proposals
for Who-joon's pictorial.

243
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:36,480
Why did you do that?

244
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:39,820
It drives the working-level editors crazy
if you suddenly call it off.

245
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:42,020
Why did you do that because of me?

246
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,730
It's not particularly because of you.

247
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:49,590
I don't know whose idea that was,

248
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,800
but it's way too cliche and stuff,
you know.

249
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:55,920
Why? It looked fine to me.

250
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:58,560
Then why did you sit around
and let her take it?

251
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:01,070
You even sat around
when they threw you out,

252
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,530
then came to my agency
to put up a protest.

253
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:06,350
We got here now
because of your weird decisions.

254
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,810
-Who do you think made this happen?
-What?

255
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,370
Why do you think
I was kicked out in the first place?

256
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:14,890
You're the one who got me kicked out
before I got a chance to do anything.

257
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,470
Only if I hadn't run into you,

258
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,760
I would've still been working here
right now.

259
00:16:18,850 --> 00:16:20,340
Why are you taking it out on me?

260
00:16:21,530 --> 00:16:22,720
Hey, fine.

261
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:25,310
Let's say you got fired because of me.

262
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,000
But it doesn't look like
that's the only reason.

263
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,030
You always sit and just take
everything she says.

264
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:34,330
They probably thought you'd nod
and stay still when they kick you out.

265
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,960
They thought of you as nothing.

266
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:38,650
Don't you think that's why you were fired?

267
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:41,770
I honestly don't get it.

268
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,930
I thought you'd agree to leave right away.

269
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:47,890
Don't talk like that.

270
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:49,600
I'm not the only one here
talking like this.

271
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:50,920
The least you can do is thank me

272
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:53,300
for saving you from her bullying.
But this is what I get?

273
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:55,810
Look at you.
You're only thinking in your shoes,

274
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,570
overly emotional, and impulsive.

275
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:59,590
Then you say whatever you want to say.

276
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,100
Don't you think
you don't fit to be a reporter?

277
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:05,050
Do I seem like a joke to you
because I let everyone run me over?

278
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:09,140
I was Just Geun-young
who has no presence while I worked here,

279
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:10,940
but I was happier writing articles here

280
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,190
than being on TV
in an outfit that doesn't fit me.

281
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:15,780
How can you say that to me
after you ruined everything?

282
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,609
What doesn't suit me...

283
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,970
is you.

284
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,850
Did you meet him?

285
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:38,050
(He's a Korean-Japanese man.)

286
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:39,190
He's in his 50s,

287
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,570
and he emigrated to Japan in his 30s.

288
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:43,330
What about the photo?

289
00:17:43,410 --> 00:17:44,600
That's his ring.

290
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:47,680
(Two men came over with the same ring,)

291
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:50,670
(then asked him
about people who have those rings.)

292
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,040
And what did he say?

293
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:56,830
He said he made matching rings
with his friends 27 years ago.

294
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:01,280
Those guys who went to see him
didn't say anything about the reason?

295
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,480
(They simply said
they had to find a person.)

296
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,060
Before they do,

297
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:08,540
we have to find the man
they are looking for first.

298
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:12,320
Keep looking,
and call me if you have an update.

299
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:13,510
Yes, sir.

300
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:16,500
A ring from 27 years ago?

301
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,710
Who is he looking for?

302
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,860
(Drinking a sip
of Gold Cafe Latte with you.)

303
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,380
Who-joon embracing his anti-fan?

304
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:33,530
So you're doing a show?

305
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:35,900
You don't actually believe that, do you?

306
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,680
I hope you aren't that big of an idiot.

307
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:45,140
(Drinking a sip
of Gold Cafe Latte with you.)

308
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:01,950
-Hello?
(-Geun-young.)

309
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:03,540
(It's me, JJ.)

310
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:05,780
Hey.

311
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:05,870
(Shooting Star Entertainment Company)
Hey.

312
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:06,180
(Shooting Star Entertainment Company)

313
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:08,020
You canceled the pictorial?
(Shooting Star Entertainment Company)

314
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,370
They said they'll let you shoot
"So I Married the Anti-Fan",

315
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,950
so why not?

316
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,030
To be honest,

317
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,540
I just don't want to do it.

318
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:26,110
Do you think
your words can decide everything?

319
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:29,140
Is it because of that woman?

320
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,340
Because she was fired from that magazine?

321
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:34,820
Did she beg you
and ask you to turn it down?

322
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,840
I'd rather have her beg to me.

323
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:39,920
If it's really because of her,
you are out of your mind.

324
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:43,000
Even if it wasn't the case,
you must be out of your mind

325
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:44,540
to turn down a magazine shooting.

326
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:47,180
Come on! How many times
do you have to make me say this?

327
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,940
I just don't want to do it!

328
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,800
Instead of me, you can...
Yes, make Ji-hyuk do it.

329
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:52,990
What?

330
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,690
Hey, are you jealous?

331
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:59,720
Jealous? That's gross.

332
00:19:59,810 --> 00:20:01,920
You told me to find a rookie,

333
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:03,460
so I did. What now?

334
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:05,930
That's what I'm saying. It's great.

335
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:09,360
So I'm trying to help.
Make him do it instead of me.

336
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:12,130
It's not like we signed a contract.

337
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,150
This isn't the first pictorial
that was called off.

338
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,050
You're good at patching up
stuff like this.

339
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:17,720
Whatever, I'm not doing this!

340
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:20,230
I'm not doing it, so good luck!

341
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:23,530
Hey. Hey!

342
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,210
Hey, stop right there! Hey!

343
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:29,290
-That's it.
-Hey.

344
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,620
Have you been concerned about Geun-young?

345
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:33,030
No.

346
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,220
It's for no reason.

347
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,540
-Hey, Who-joon.
-Walk right inside.

348
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,480
I gave you a present.

349
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:43,630
My present?

350
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,220
Go on.

351
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:49,350
Young-suk! Did Joon leave you my present?

352
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,890
What present?

353
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:54,720
Today's shooting must've been tough.

354
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:57,850
Yes, it was kind of tough today.

355
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:02,510
Actually, we did the shooting
at my previous workplace.

356
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,240
I see, it must've put you in a tough spot.

357
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:08,010
Well, I quit that place anyway,

358
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:10,470
so some might say
I have no reason to be concerned...

359
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,890
How can you not be concerned?

360
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,530
How can people be so cold
just because it's not their life?

361
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:17,250
-Right?
-Tell me about it.

362
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,230
Hey, it's me. Open the door.

363
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:39,120
It's me. Open up.

364
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,550
Did she go somewhere?

365
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,590
I'm coming in.

366
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:57,020
I got in huge trouble because of you.
Where did you go?

367
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,940
Don't you think it's really awful
how they decided to do the shooting there?

368
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,320
What's wrong? Pick it up.

369
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:08,640
No, it's okay.

370
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,840
(-The person you have reached...)
-What?

371
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,470
You won't even pick up.

372
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,620
We're with "Wonder Woman."

373
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:19,600
You're a reporter?

374
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:21,050
Right.

375
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:25,540
Hey, it's me.

376
00:22:26,060 --> 00:22:27,780
Do you have the name card
of the photographer

377
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:32,310
So? What happened?

378
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,070
I couldn't be cool about it.

379
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,140
I talked back to my ex-boss.

380
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:39,570
I thought that would
at least make me feel better.

381
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,460
But not really.

382
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:43,750
I feel bad.

383
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,480
People are all bullying you, Geun-young.

384
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:49,740
I'll protect you from now on.

385
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:53,740
Why are they messing with our rookie?

386
00:22:55,190 --> 00:22:57,700
What rookie? What do you mean, a rookie?

387
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:59,940
You need to stop joking around.

388
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:01,350
Joking around?

389
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,920
I'm not the type
who says one thing and does the other.

390
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:07,730
I have the contract. I'll bring it now.

391
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:10,200
No, come on. Stop it.

392
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,380
Whoa.

393
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:23,790
You're pretty strong.

394
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,460
Sorry.

395
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,420
I really have it here.

396
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:43,460
Why? Do you know what it is?

397
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:45,260
Yes.

398
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,610
It looks similar to the one
I picked up in Japan.

399
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:51,470
You picked up a ring?

400
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:53,580
Yes, someone had lost it.

401
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:57,360
Wait, is it yours?

402
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:59,910
Did you lose it
when you were at the hotel?

403
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:04,230
-Yes.
-I left it at the front desk.

404
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,560
-You did?
-Yes.

405
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:08,410
My gosh, thanks.

406
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:20,990
Do you actually think
I'm going to pick up your call?

407
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:21,250
(Punk)

408
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:22,400
Hey, punk.
I have a little something called pride.
(Punk)

409
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,200
Hey, punk.
I have a little something called pride.

410
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:38,810
Hey, Su-hwan.

411
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:41,630
(Geun-young, why aren't you here yet?
Where are you?)

412
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:46,290
Did you already get drunk without me?

413
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,020
I'm here now.

414
00:24:51,830 --> 00:24:54,340
Hey, Geun-young. Why are you so late?

415
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:20,040
Why are you here?

416
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:22,240
Don't talk to him like that.

417
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:25,360
Why didn't you tell me
that you invited our dear Who-joon?

418
00:25:25,450 --> 00:25:27,610
Why didn't you pick up your phone?

419
00:25:28,570 --> 00:25:29,940
"Our dear Who-joon"?

420
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:33,060
You know, on that day
when you threw up on him,

421
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:35,040
I gave them my name card, remember?

422
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:37,290
He remembered that.

423
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:39,310
He's such a smart guy.

424
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,860
You don't have to call me smart.

425
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:45,600
It's such an unforgettable day, after all.

426
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,400
Goodness, you fool. You must be insane.

427
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:51,940
How did you end up

428
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:54,840
throwing up on him?

429
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:57,610
So? Did you throw away your shoes?

430
00:25:58,010 --> 00:25:59,330
I'm sure they were expensive.

431
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:02,360
Mi-jung, it's because you weren't there.

432
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:05,050
He couldn't have washed those enough.

433
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,040
My goodness, how could you do that?

434
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:10,020
No, it's okay, Mi-jung.

435
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,530
You'll make her embarrassed.

436
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:17,850
And I'm the type
who can easily put things behind me.

437
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:21,900
He's such a big guy.

438
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:25,020
He's so generous that he should be
more than the world's biggest star.

439
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,660
Maybe we should call him
the universal star.

440
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:29,250
Let's have a drink.

441
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:32,110
What are you all doing?

442
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:38,090
Goodness.

443
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,620
Geun-young, join us.

444
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:43,990
You like soju, right?

445
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:46,360
Yes, but I'll drink on my own.

446
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:52,610
One more drink.

447
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:56,530
♫ I wonder what is love ♫

448
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,630
♫ There's no answer
to this sweet question ♫

449
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:05,240
♫ But still, I'm falling ♫

450
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:09,770
♫ And again, I'm falling ♫

451
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:16,370
♫ You and I are falling in love ♫

452
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,550
How was it? Does it suit me?

453
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,060
Are you allowed to do this
behind your agency's back?

454
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,260
They won't have to know it's me.

455
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:28,210
Once this song becomes a hit,
everything will be fine.

456
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:32,390
I'm not sure.
Do secrets exist in this industry?

457
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:36,130
Let's take it from the top.

458
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:37,840
Okay.

459
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:41,190
So where was I today?

460
00:27:41,280 --> 00:27:45,020
Exactly. You were at "Wonder Woman",

461
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,610
and Who-joon saved you.

462
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,520
Save me from what? He's not Superman.

463
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,320
He's doing that just to look cool.

464
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:54,120
It's all staged.

465
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:57,070
Please try to understand.

466
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:59,450
I see why Geun-young would think
it's unfair.

467
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:02,830
That proposal was actually hers too.

468
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,200
Hey, no.

469
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:07,100
Don't even bring it up.

470
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:09,960
He said it's bad. That it's cliche.

471
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:16,210
That magazine itself is
what I think is bad.

472
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:19,510
Who's that woman?
That woman with weird makeup.

473
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,870
I don't like her.

474
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:24,790
You're at 50 meters again.

475
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:28,710
I should've made him some chicken
on a day like this.

476
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:33,990
Chicken? Isn't that what
mothers-in-law make for their sons-in-law?

477
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:36,760
She works at a chicken shop.

478
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:39,220
A chicken shop?
It's a fried chicken restaurant.

479
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:42,920
You can't even be at a chicken place
because of people, right?

480
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:45,820
But I'd like to visit that place
where you work, Mi-jung.

481
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:47,930
I love fried chicken.

482
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:49,470
I love fried chicken too.

483
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,320
We have lots in common.

484
00:28:51,410 --> 00:28:53,260
All Koreans love fried chicken.

485
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:56,290
Which type do you like?
Fried chicken or seasoned?

486
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,830
In one, two, three!

487
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,020
-Fried!
-Fried!

488
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,490
-We have lots in common.
-We do.

489
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:02,890
Seasoned chicken is the best.

490
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,730
Hey, Mrs. Jang. You're still up.

491
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:11,560
(You brat. You must feel better
if you're drunk-calling me.)

492
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:17,280
You must also feel better
if you can call me a brat. Where's Dad?

493
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:20,190
He's easily convinced, right?

494
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:24,850
One day, he gets furious and wants to go
pop the antennas from the TV station,

495
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:28,990
then I guess someone said it must be great
to have a daughter who's famous.

496
00:29:29,070 --> 00:29:30,830
(He fell for that)

497
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:34,130
and got another set of biographies
after he got drunk.

498
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:38,530
Goodness, our storage at home
must be full yet again.

499
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,990
It's not just the storage.

500
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:43,150
Your mother's stress level is full too.

501
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:47,690
Yes, I should cut up
some Korean melons I got.

502
00:29:50,150 --> 00:29:52,440
Who-joon, do you like Korean melons?

503
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:54,990
Yes, I eat them all right.

504
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:59,560
I'm your guy when it comes
to cutting Korean melons. I'll be back.

505
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:01,720
Wait for me!

506
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:09,990
Hey, Ji-hyang.

507
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:14,080
What? I'll be down there.

508
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,080
Mom.

509
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:20,950
You really don't have to worry
about me anymore.

510
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:24,380
I'm really, really, really fine.

511
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:26,760
(I'm not worried about you anymore.)

512
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:30,450
Come to think about it, your dad is worse

513
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:33,750
when it comes to making me worried.

514
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:39,250
But you, Geun-young,
were a girl who would wake up by yourself

515
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:42,420
even if I didn't come for you
in the morning.

516
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,730
Mom, kids all wake up early.

517
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:49,640
Geun-young, I...

518
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:52,890
Wait, are you going to say
you're sorry again?

519
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:59,100
My gosh, stop saying you're sorry.

520
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:04,020
Just listen you brat. I...

521
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:10,840
Goodness, I have to go to sleep.
What time is it?

522
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,650
-Okay.
(-And stop drinking so much you brat.)

523
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:20,080
You're still alive and fine, Mrs. Jang.
Go to sleep.

524
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:22,500
I'll call you again.

525
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:25,280
Goodness.

526
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:36,940
Your phone is totally fine.
Why won't you pick up?

527
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:41,640
Did you forget what you said?
Is your brain as small as that of a fish?

528
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:43,580
You're getting emotional again.

529
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:47,540
You must be very happy
to be an expert at hiding emotions.

530
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:50,440
Why did you come here
to act out this smiley scene?

531
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:52,820
I wasn't acting back there.

532
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:55,850
You wouldn't pick up, so I thought
something may have happened...

533
00:31:58,410 --> 00:31:59,640
It's not that I was worried.

534
00:32:02,150 --> 00:32:05,670
Why do you care
if anything bad happens to me?

535
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:09,230
What has gotten into you?

536
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:14,860
If this is
because of what happened last time,

537
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:18,290
I'll call it a mistake
if that's what you want it to be.

538
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:20,980
Forget it.
If you don't know who, forget it.

539
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:24,010
Hey, if I did it as a mistake,
I would've said so.

540
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:27,310
Do you think I'll make an excuse
saying I mistook you for someone?

541
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:29,510
And would that make you feel any better?

542
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:40,250
Forget it and go.
You really don't belong here.

543
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:57,010
I'm sorry. I have to work tomorrow,

544
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,040
so my manager came. I should go.

545
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:01,240
-No!
-No!

546
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:02,910
Have this at least.

547
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,590
Goodness, I can't believe you two.

548
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:07,970
I'll invite you to my place next time.

549
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,290
Really? When?

550
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:11,180
We have to set a date now...

551
00:33:11,710 --> 00:33:14,310
He can't possibly know
what he has on his schedule.

552
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:17,030
Please check your schedule
and give me a call.

553
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,890
I'll do that. Have a great time.

554
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:21,430
Geun-young.

555
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:25,170
-Go home safely.
-Okay. Bye.

556
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:30,150
-You don't have to come.
-How can we not?

557
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:33,450
-Goodbye.
-Bye!

558
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:37,670
My gosh, this is awesome!

559
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,250
This is awesome.

560
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:40,880
He seems nice.

561
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:44,270
Hey, the Who-joon you thought you knew
was a big misunderstanding.

562
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:48,630
She's right. You can tell
what a man is like when he drinks.

563
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:51,040
He's a very nice man.

564
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:52,230
And gentle.

565
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:54,080
Are you two really my friends?

566
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:55,620
You saw everything at the club.

567
00:33:55,710 --> 00:33:57,510
You heard the whole story from me.

568
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,150
Do you like him so much
even after everything he did?

569
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,740
I didn't say I liked him.

570
00:34:01,820 --> 00:34:05,830
Yes, we're trying to say
he doesn't seem all that bad.

571
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,820
That's enough.

572
00:34:10,489 --> 00:34:12,210
I know that he's not a bad guy.

573
00:34:12,650 --> 00:34:14,060
That's why it's much more annoying.

574
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,500
-Honey, you're here.
-Was that Who-joon?

575
00:34:18,850 --> 00:34:20,699
When did he come? Why didn't you call?

576
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:24,090
Your bar exam is coming up,
so I didn't want to bother you.

577
00:34:24,350 --> 00:34:27,210
It's just Who-joon.
Why would I bother you over him?

578
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:30,070
Am I not considered as a person
until the exam?

579
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,800
Why do you keep telling me
to do everything after the exam?

580
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:40,850
Anyway, where are we?

581
00:34:43,929 --> 00:34:45,030
Just...

582
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:48,460
Ji-hyang,
I'm starting to feel the alcohol.

583
00:34:54,139 --> 00:34:56,030
You've been saying that a lot recently.

584
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:27,100
I wonder if she went home well.

585
00:35:34,050 --> 00:35:36,690
(Just Lee Geun-young)

586
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:47,510
What's going on?

587
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:49,140
What are you doing?

588
00:35:50,110 --> 00:35:51,210
What?

589
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:54,070
Why am I standing?

590
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:59,080
Why won't you ring the bell?
This isn't your house.

591
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:05,370
My gosh.

592
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:14,310
He has been very odd lately.

593
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:19,060
Geun-young, have you been well?

594
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,240
Hey, we met a few days ago.

595
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,820
Right, we did.

596
00:36:25,390 --> 00:36:27,950
I was wondering
if you were okay over the last few days.

597
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:30,010
I've been really out of it lately.

598
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:34,280
You used to help me out a lot
when you were with us.

599
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:35,650
Because I'm Just Geun-young?

600
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:38,730
What I'm saying is that
you're irreplaceable.

601
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:40,000
As if.

602
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:42,250
Do you remember that day?

603
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:45,770
We were reading articles on Who-joon
in the office at the end of the year

604
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:48,140
talking about him together.

605
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:52,590
But now you're on the news with him.
It was really uncanny.

606
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:54,350
I remember that day.

607
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:56,500
I was the only one who worked overtime.

608
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:57,690
Really?

609
00:36:58,220 --> 00:37:01,610
It's all because of that Bean Moon Hee
or Mean Moon Hee or whatever.

610
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:03,980
Why would she make you do overtime
at the end of the year?

611
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,020
-Hey.
-Geun-young.

612
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,220
Please try to convince Who-joon.

613
00:37:10,490 --> 00:37:13,270
If he cancels his pictorial now,

614
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:15,200
what are we going to do?

615
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:19,070
Then Ms. Cha should've been here.

616
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:20,790
You know how she is.

617
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,680
Look at all these cold sores.

618
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:25,150
We're all dying back in the office.

619
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:28,490
And I used to be the only one
who was dying back when I was there.

620
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,680
Geun-young.

621
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:32,050
I decided to go to church.

622
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:34,300
-What?
-To repent on what I did.

623
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:37,070
Or should I go to a temple?
Should I go bald and go to a mountain?

624
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:41,120
If you tell me to do that, I will.

625
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:42,920
Please?

626
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:06,680
What's wrong? Are you expecting a call?

627
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,660
No.

628
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:11,560
Which do you want to sing first?

629
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,400
Hey, can we take a short break?

630
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:17,590
Sure.

631
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:27,620
I knew you'd all end up
asking me for a favor.

632
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:35,410
Hello?

633
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,440
-What are you up to?
-Why?

634
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:42,140
Well, where are you?
I have something to say.

635
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,290
(Shooting Star Entertainment Company)

636
00:38:43,290 --> 00:38:44,390
Right now?

637
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:45,490
(Shooting Star Entertainment Company)

638
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:45,580
I'm at the agency.
(Shooting Star Entertainment Company)

639
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:46,900
I'm at the agency.

640
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:48,440
I'll be there.

641
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,500
Are you sure? You're going to come here?

642
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:52,790
It's not like I won't be allowed in.

643
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,380
I'll be there now. Bye.

644
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:11,930
People say
we humans are animals who forget.

645
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:12,770
(We love you, Who-joon.)

646
00:39:12,770 --> 00:39:15,450
I completely forgot about those girls.
(We love you, Who-joon.)

647
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,360
What should I do?

648
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:24,160
-Mr. Seo.
-He said you'd be here like this.

649
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:27,240
Come with me.
There's a back door for VIPs.

650
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:29,400
-Really? I'm so relieved.
-Of course. Let's go.

651
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:37,670
May I come in?

652
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,080
You're here.

653
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,240
Aren't you working?

654
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:43,520
I have a recording session soon,

655
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:45,640
but it's okay. Grab a seat.

656
00:39:49,770 --> 00:39:52,100
So this is
what a recording studio looks like.

657
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:54,520
It looks cool.

658
00:39:57,650 --> 00:40:00,510
Anyway, you came all this way to say what?

659
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:01,690
Right.

660
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:07,190
A senior of mine
from "Wonder Woman" came to see me.

661
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:10,580
Can you just say
you'll do the pictorial again?

662
00:40:10,670 --> 00:40:12,430
It looked like they were in trouble.

663
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:15,640
Then what will you do for me?

664
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:17,180
It's not for me.

665
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:20,170
I mean, you'll be the guy
who keeps his promises,

666
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:22,590
and it's not like I owe you anything.

667
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:25,100
Do you loathe
doing something for me that much?

668
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,920
Then stay and listen to me sing
before you leave.

669
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:34,830
Try to judge me objectively
with your ears for popular songs.

670
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:36,590
-Then I'll think about it.
-Fine.

671
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:38,790
That's not very difficult.

672
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,940
I'll stay and listen. Go sing.

673
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:53,750
♫ I wonder what is love ♫

674
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:58,670
♫ I wanna know what is love ♫

675
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:02,150
♫ That sweet flavor ♫

676
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:06,200
♫ But what is this dark flavor? ♫

677
00:41:07,030 --> 00:41:10,690
♫ I wonder what is love ♫

678
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:15,880
♫ There's no answer
to this sweet question ♫

679
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:19,180
♫ But still, I'm falling in love ♫

680
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:23,180
(He has such good looks
and a great voice.)

681
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:28,290
(I kissed that guy.)

682
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:30,270
So?

683
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,670
Well, not bad.

684
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,350
The problem is the woman's part.

685
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:34,930
We have to find someone to sing that.

686
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:38,410
The songwriter sent us a guide track.
Do you want to listen to it?

687
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:16,380
Hey, do you know
who sang that woman's part?

688
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:19,280
Yes, what was her name again? Oh In-hyung?

689
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:21,390
She seemed like a rookie.

690
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:25,180
I'm thinking of finding someone
who's a bit more famous. Why?

691
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:27,070
No, nothing. Let's talk later.

692
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:31,250
So? What did you think?

693
00:42:31,910 --> 00:42:34,860
Well, the song was great.

694
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:37,280
-It's the singer who's cheesy.
-What?

695
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,870
Now that I'm done, may I be excused?

696
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:42,730
I have a schedule out of town.
I'll leave with you.

697
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,640
-I'll go, then.
-Okay.

698
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:47,400
-Great work.
-Sure.

699
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:49,020
"Great work."

700
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,010
I can drop you off.
You should hitch a ride with us.

701
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:07,900
-Do that, Geun-young.
-It's okay.

702
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:09,400
You have to go out of the city.

703
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,510
I can get myself home, so go.

704
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,280
You're very stubborn
when it comes to odd things.

705
00:43:14,370 --> 00:43:16,920
Okay, go home safely,
and I'll see you tomorrow at the shooting.

706
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:21,980
Bye.

707
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,700
Okay. Bye.

708
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:45,170
(Going down. 10th floor.)

709
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:53,590
It is you, Lee Geun-young.

710
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:58,340
Hey!

711
00:44:58,430 --> 00:45:00,580
Let me in! Let me go inside!

712
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:08,370
Who are you?

713
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:12,150
(The door is locked.)

714
00:45:15,150 --> 00:45:17,870
You're a student, aren't you?

715
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:20,250
This isn't our first time.
Don't speak all respectfully.

716
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:22,670
Then have we met before?

717
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,560
You have a bad memory.

718
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:27,730
We fought each other. The egg.

719
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:32,830
How old are you girls?

720
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:34,020
Eighteen.

721
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:36,180
We're eighteen. So what?

722
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:37,370
Hey!

723
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:42,070
That was hardly a fight!
You all ganged up on me!

724
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,390
Don't worry.

725
00:45:43,610 --> 00:45:46,870
I felt a little bad as I went home.

726
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,380
-A little bad?
-Where is he? Who-joon, I mean.

727
00:45:49,770 --> 00:45:51,270
He's not here right now.

728
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:52,980
Then why are you here?

729
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:57,380
I'm... I stopped by to get something
I left here.

730
00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:00,110
You're a bad liar.

731
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:02,580
I already know you live here.

732
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:05,170
Do you think
I didn't find that out before I came?

733
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:10,230
That's... That's something
that adults have discussed.

734
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:12,650
You need to go home.
I'll call the security.

735
00:46:12,740 --> 00:46:15,160
Is an adult threatening a high school kid?

736
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:22,380
Let's make a deal.

737
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:23,780
If you let me see him,

738
00:46:23,870 --> 00:46:26,070
I won't tell anyone that you live here.

739
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,020
What if I uploaded this fact
on a fan website?

740
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:34,300
You know what will happen, don't you?

741
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:40,420
You little rascal. I'm not scared.

742
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,970
Just let me see him. Then I'll leave.

743
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:44,770
If you don't,

744
00:46:45,610 --> 00:46:46,970
I'll just stay.

745
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:48,730
Hey.

746
00:46:49,350 --> 00:46:51,150
My gosh, I'm starving.

747
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:54,670
Do you have any food?
I had to do a stakeout all day long.

748
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:57,530
You're a grown woman.
Why did you come home so late?

749
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:03,960
Let's see if she has any food.

750
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:06,420
What's with her?

751
00:47:06,770 --> 00:47:09,590
I love you, Who-joon!

752
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:12,320
How is he such a cutie?

753
00:47:17,730 --> 00:47:20,940
-Thanks.
-I'll call him.

754
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:32,380
Milky-white, Who-joon!

755
00:47:33,390 --> 00:47:36,160
Am I allowed to be here with someone
who's crazy about him?

756
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:39,380
-You're so handsome, Who-joon!
-She isn't easy to get rid of.

757
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,470
-This is so uncomfortable.
-He's so good.

758
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:49,800
Right, he said he'll be out of town.

759
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:53,720
My gosh.

760
00:47:55,610 --> 00:47:58,160
I'm sorry. I can't reach him.

761
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:01,070
Go home for now. I'll give you a call.

762
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:02,780
Then I'll wait until tomorrow.

763
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,850
I live in Gimje,

764
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:06,300
so it's too late to go home anyway.

765
00:48:06,390 --> 00:48:07,670
You live in Gimje?

766
00:48:08,410 --> 00:48:09,510
Yes.

767
00:48:11,010 --> 00:48:14,220
Then you came from Gimje this morning?

768
00:48:14,530 --> 00:48:17,040
Do you do that every day
just to see Who-joon?

769
00:48:17,610 --> 00:48:19,850
That must require a lot of time and money.

770
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:22,010
I ran from home about a week ago.

771
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:24,740
What? You ran from home?

772
00:48:24,830 --> 00:48:27,330
Your parents must be worried.
Did you call them?

773
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:32,260
They won't worry. I'm like a lost article.

774
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:33,710
A lost article?

775
00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:40,450
I mean, my dad is
the stationmaster at Gimje Station.

776
00:48:40,530 --> 00:48:41,720
Once I left home,

777
00:48:41,810 --> 00:48:44,230
he had me registered
at the station's lost and found.

778
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:46,830
I'm sure it was a joke.

779
00:48:46,910 --> 00:48:49,330
How can he joke around
when his daughter left home?

780
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:57,560
And do you have to kick out
a poor kid who has nowhere else to go

781
00:48:58,050 --> 00:49:00,030
this late at night?

782
00:49:02,490 --> 00:49:06,100
Wait, tonight is the second episode of
"So I Married the Anti-Fan".

783
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,970
(And I'm rather crafty
for an entertainer.)

784
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:12,390
(That's not what I meant.)

785
00:49:13,490 --> 00:49:16,480
(I can't let you do something this tough.)

786
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:20,130
(Hard-working looks!)

787
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:21,190
(Hard-working effort!)

788
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:22,380
(Awesome Who-joon)

789
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:27,440
(-I'm sorry, something's missing.)
-He's so cool!

790
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:28,490
That's insane.

791
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:30,390
She's really excited, isn't she?

792
00:49:30,470 --> 00:49:33,330
(-Are you doing that right?)
-This is so romantic.

793
00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:38,610
This episode is
also only full of Who-joon's cool sides.

794
00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:44,160
Right. It might be better
that he continues to air such scenes.

795
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:46,710
(Geun-young mops!)

796
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:47,940
(But...)

797
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:49,440
(Is that his shirt?)

798
00:49:50,490 --> 00:49:53,480
Darn it. That's his shirt!

799
00:49:53,530 --> 00:49:54,940
(Working hard with Who-joon's shirt)

800
00:49:55,990 --> 00:49:59,780
-Darn it. Does she know how much that is?
-When did they get this on camera?

801
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:01,760
I can't believe her.

802
00:50:06,550 --> 00:50:06,680
(Darn it, how dare she
turn his clothes into rags?)

803
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:09,940
(So I Married the Anti-Fan)
(Darn it, how dare she
turn his clothes into rags?)

804
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:10,120
(You'll learn your lesson
after you look like rags.)
(So I Married the Anti-Fan)
(Darn it, how dare she
turn his clothes into rags?)

805
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:12,450
(You'll learn your lesson
after you look like rags.)

806
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:14,520
(That awful woman always does that.)

807
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,060
I'm sure there was a reason
behind that situation.

808
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:17,460
(She's so annoying!)
I'm sure there was a reason
behind that situation.

809
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:19,490
I don't think it's a good idea
to jump to conclusions

810
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:22,170
as Who-joon's fans
when we don't know the whole story.

811
00:50:23,050 --> 00:50:24,590
(I have Lee Geun-young in my hands.)

812
00:50:24,590 --> 00:50:26,480
(Pure Yu-ri)
(I have Lee Geun-young in my hands.)

813
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:30,400
(I'm watching you 24 hours a day.)

814
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,140
Hey, are you Pure Yu-ri?

815
00:50:36,030 --> 00:50:38,670
(Pure Yu-ri, you can't do this here.)

816
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:41,140
No way. I can't believe her.

817
00:50:41,750 --> 00:50:45,800
(You're the one who can't do this here.)

818
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:47,300
(Does Who-joon know
you girls are doing this?)

819
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:50,330
You've become an enemy
to all his fans around the world.

820
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:52,220
(You've become an enemy...)

821
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:00,500
(I see how low his fans are.)

822
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:02,560
She really makes me angry.

823
00:51:05,030 --> 00:51:05,640
You're dead.

824
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:07,450
(Are you Lee Geun-young?)
You're dead.

825
00:51:07,540 --> 00:51:08,640
(Wouldn't she be with Who-joon right now?)

826
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:34,290
She found her place to sleep.

827
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:36,220
What a great life you have.

828
00:51:37,150 --> 00:51:39,000
It's a ceasefire until tomorrow.

829
00:51:48,890 --> 00:51:50,520
Goodness, are you going home?

830
00:51:50,610 --> 00:51:52,330
I'm glad you made that decision.

831
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:54,610
Who-joon is shooting a talk show today.

832
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:56,640
I need to run over and line up.

833
00:51:56,730 --> 00:51:58,270
Right, so you're going there.

834
00:51:58,350 --> 00:52:00,250
Yes, of course. You're his fan.

835
00:52:00,330 --> 00:52:03,550
Right, make sure you let me see him
after the shooting.

836
00:52:03,770 --> 00:52:05,130
If you don't,

837
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:07,590
-I'll sleep here again.
-No.

838
00:52:08,830 --> 00:52:10,850
You've become bolder overnight.

839
00:52:13,580 --> 00:52:15,870
Then I'll take these as a hostage.

840
00:52:18,460 --> 00:52:19,560
Here.

841
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:21,980
It's your real birthday present.

842
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:24,450
Put them on and see if they fit.

843
00:52:24,530 --> 00:52:25,630
Not those.

844
00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:28,270
Where did you get those?

845
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:30,560
Give it back. I have to put them on.

846
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:32,320
Have you heard of product placement?

847
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:35,890
Then don't betray me, okay?

848
00:52:35,970 --> 00:52:37,340
Have you always been fooled?

849
00:52:41,830 --> 00:52:43,590
I heard Who-joon is
releasing a single album.

850
00:52:43,670 --> 00:52:44,910
Did you look into that?

851
00:52:45,430 --> 00:52:49,700
Well, I heard
he'll be releasing this song.

852
00:52:49,790 --> 00:52:52,210
-I heard it's a duet.
-A duet?

853
00:52:52,300 --> 00:52:54,320
-But it's...
-Play it.

854
00:52:56,870 --> 00:52:59,690
What kind of a duet could it be?

855
00:53:00,130 --> 00:53:01,760
(Title: Who-joon's single)

856
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:07,520
-AR Team.
-Yes, sir.

857
00:53:07,610 --> 00:53:10,070
Is there anything I can release
before he releases this?

858
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:12,230
We do. We have a few songs ready.

859
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:18,130
So who sang the female part?

860
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:25,210
Well, it's...

861
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:28,770
In-hyung recorded this without telling us.

862
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:31,460
I'm sorry.

863
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:02,300
Ms. No.

864
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:02,700
(Stage of Rejoice)
Ms. No.

865
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:03,090
(Stage of Rejoice)

866
00:54:03,090 --> 00:54:04,720
Geun-young, you're here.
(Stage of Rejoice)

867
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:06,350
(Stage of Rejoice)

868
00:54:07,710 --> 00:54:11,100
You'll be handing out the beverages today.

869
00:54:11,190 --> 00:54:12,990
There will be a few fans at the rehearsal,

870
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:14,840
but you can deal with them now, right?

871
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:17,740
Take this. You got this. You can do this!

872
00:54:17,830 --> 00:54:19,590
You got it!

873
00:54:21,090 --> 00:54:24,920
Is she clueless or thoughtless?

874
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:30,460
-Geun-young, you're here.
-Hey.

875
00:54:30,550 --> 00:54:32,750
-Hello.
-Hello.

876
00:54:38,290 --> 00:54:39,920
Where are we going?

877
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:42,300
Be quiet. Let's listen to some music.

878
00:54:42,430 --> 00:54:44,760
(Who-joon's single)

879
00:54:47,090 --> 00:54:48,540
-This is...
-Yes.

880
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:54,130
Why? Why did you betray me again?

881
00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:00,070
How did this song end up...

882
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:03,860
No, Jae-joon.
I had no idea this was Joon's song.

883
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:10,370
We'll find out in time.

884
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:28,450
Joon, what are you doing?

885
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:35,710
-Is Lee Geun-young here?
-Yes, I said hi to her.

886
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:37,380
-You did?
-Yes.

887
00:55:37,690 --> 00:55:39,540
Why won't she say hi to me?

888
00:55:39,630 --> 00:55:40,900
How would I know?

889
00:55:41,690 --> 00:55:44,550
Ji-hyang, and the stage here is...

890
00:55:48,250 --> 00:55:50,050
Here. Take one.

891
00:55:50,850 --> 00:55:53,090
Take one. Thank you.

892
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:56,790
Thank you.

893
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:00,220
Why do you make her do that
in front of the fans?

894
00:56:00,310 --> 00:56:02,240
You know that she's scared of my fans.

895
00:56:02,330 --> 00:56:05,890
-I didn't make her do that.
-I don't understand this. I don't get it.

896
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:09,060
Why can't they make someone else do it?

897
00:56:09,150 --> 00:56:11,920
Yes! She wore them! Yes!

898
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:17,990
What should I say?

899
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:22,310
I see you have those shoes on.

900
00:56:24,730 --> 00:56:25,960
Your shoes look pretty.

901
00:56:27,670 --> 00:56:29,040
Thank you.

902
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:38,760
Here.

903
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:43,340
(Punk)

904
00:56:43,340 --> 00:56:44,570
(Your shoes look pretty.)
(Punk)

905
00:56:47,610 --> 00:56:49,150
Geun-young, I'll have that.

906
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:51,870
There are more crew members inside.
Come with me.

907
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:53,060
Okay.

908
00:56:53,330 --> 00:56:54,430
This way.

909
00:56:56,800 --> 00:56:57,900
Have you been well?

910
00:57:03,450 --> 00:57:04,550
Why are you here?

911
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:06,220
I heard you're doing a talk show.

912
00:57:06,310 --> 00:57:08,460
I came to show my support
and say something.

913
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:10,400
What is it? Make it quick. I have to go.

914
00:57:10,490 --> 00:57:13,790
I mean, there's a rumor going around
about how In-hyung will

915
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:16,070
sing a duet with you for your new song.

916
00:57:19,020 --> 00:57:21,710
Why are you so shocked?
There are no secrets in this industry.

917
00:57:22,410 --> 00:57:26,060
But if something like that happened,
you should've told me first.

918
00:57:26,150 --> 00:57:27,950
I think there's a misunderstanding.

919
00:57:28,610 --> 00:57:30,070
I did get the demo,

920
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:32,530
but nothing has been decided.

921
00:57:37,190 --> 00:57:39,310
Hey, Geun-young. You were here too.

922
00:57:39,920 --> 00:57:41,500
Oh, hello.

923
00:57:41,590 --> 00:57:42,870
And Ji-hyang.

924
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:46,560
Anyway, can we stick around
and watch this?

925
00:57:47,090 --> 00:57:49,200
I have to do a new variety show,

926
00:57:49,780 --> 00:57:52,370
but I haven't been on one for so long,
I forgot how it all works.

927
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:53,910
Sure, you can watch, then leave.

928
00:57:55,060 --> 00:57:56,240
Geun-young, let's go.

929
00:57:56,860 --> 00:57:59,500
You said you were dying to see me.
Come. We're running late.

930
00:57:59,590 --> 00:58:00,690
Let's go.

931
00:58:01,130 --> 00:58:02,230
Let's go.

932
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:07,200
(Stage of Rejoice)

933
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:11,910
You're now at the level...
Well, how can I put this?
(Stage of Rejoice)

934
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:14,860
A world-renowned star
isn't just going to cut it anymore.

935
00:58:14,940 --> 00:58:16,040
Goodness, no.

936
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:21,370
Did you ever imagine you'd be
at a place like this when you were a kid?

937
00:58:22,950 --> 00:58:27,700
I'm not sure. But I always
did picture myself on a stage.

938
00:58:27,790 --> 00:58:31,440
But imagining myself here was
always a dream.

939
00:58:31,530 --> 00:58:35,840
I really never imagined
I'd be loved so much.

940
00:58:37,120 --> 00:58:38,920
You're way too modest.

941
00:58:40,110 --> 00:58:43,760
I wonder what you were like
when you were a child.

942
00:58:43,850 --> 00:58:47,240
I'm sure you were
very popular as a child too.

943
00:58:47,330 --> 00:58:51,820
When did you have
your first love, Who-joon?

944
00:58:55,250 --> 00:58:56,480
My first love?

945
00:58:58,500 --> 00:58:59,650
Well.

946
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:05,590
It's the case for everyone, isn't it?

947
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:08,010
First love never comes to pass.

948
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:11,970
Right, that means you had your first love.

949
00:59:12,980 --> 00:59:16,940
I'm sure she'll regret it a lot
when she sees who you've become.

950
00:59:18,390 --> 00:59:19,840
I heard someone say this.

951
00:59:19,930 --> 00:59:24,200
Your second and third love
becomes history,

952
00:59:24,990 --> 00:59:29,000
but your first love
will always be your first love.

953
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:38,540
What if your first love
comes back to find you now?

954
00:59:38,630 --> 00:59:42,370
-No.
-No way.

(Stage of Rejoice)

956
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:31,780
(Stage of Rejoice)

957
01:01:03,990 --> 01:01:04,150
Then you won't mind
what I do with Geun-young.
