00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:49,760
Sharp as knives, colors clash, canvas ignites.

138
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,520
I define trend boundaries, mainstream follows.

139
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:50,920
Manman, you came to see the show too?

140
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:50,520
We've long since stopped caring about every corner.

141
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,800
Colors clash, canvas ignites, brilliance blooms.

142
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,160
Yes, I came with Xiao Li.

143
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:51,800
I define trend boundaries, mainstream follows.

144
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,360
On such an important day.

145
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:53,320
We've long since stopped caring, at every corner.

146
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,320
We'll definitely participate.

147
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:54,360
Style changes freely, avant-garde leads the way.

148
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:55,640
Do you know where it is?

149
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:55,320
Bold and unrestrained.

150
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:55,920
Do you know where it is?

151
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:55,640
Style changes freely, avant-garde leads the way.

152
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,200
Bold and unrestrained.

153
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,160
404 is not 'not found'.

154
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,440
It's the signal you can't catch up with.

155
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,560
Let's go together.

156
00:02:59,440 --> 00:02:59,440
I stand on the platform.

157
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,080
Holding an orange.

158
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,640
Leading the rhythm.

159
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,440
Like thunder.

160
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:02,960
We shatter the dust.

161
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,320
Tear apart the sky.

162
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,000
Hurry!

163
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:03,320
Old rules collapse.

164
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:04,880
Definitions vanish.

165
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,560
We rekindle the fire in our hearts.

166
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,800
Power flows like a flood.

167
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,160
Feng, I just took a photo of you.

168
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:07,800
Sweeping away everything.

169
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,840
The old world's rules.

170
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,480
I used a beauty camera.

171
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:08,840
Have begun to collapse.

172
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,250
Young power.

173
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,120
Look how many points you got.

174
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:11,600
Forcefully emerges.

175
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,480
Unstoppable.

176
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:13,120
Forget about the score.

177
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,320
It's ten points. Ten points.

178
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:17,720
We rekindle the fire in our hearts.

179
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:18,680
Power flows like a flood.

180
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,600
Sweeping away everything.

181
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:19,960
The old world's rules.

182
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,440
Have already begun to collapse.

183
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,170
Young power.

184
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:21,520
Forcefully emerges.

185
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:21,840
Unstoppable.

186
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,160
Young power rises strongly.

187
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:22,520
The message is here.

188
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:22,160
Irresistible force.

189
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:22,800
The message is here.

190
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:22,520
Young power emerges forcefully.

191
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,160
The message is here.

192
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:22,800
Unstoppable in its path.

193
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,400
Young power strikes forcefully.

194
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:23,160
The message is here.

195
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:24,760
Unstoppable in its advance.

196
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,680
We rekindle our inner fire, our power flows like a mighty current, sweeping everything away.

197
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:25,960
The old world's rules have begun to collapse as young forces strike with unstoppable momentum.

198
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,240
Lightning tears through darkness as we ignite our passion.

199
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,079
Our power surges like a flood, sweeping away everything in its path.

200
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:28,520
The old world's rules crumble as young power emerges triumphantly.

201
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:28,920
Lightning cuts through darkness, brilliance shines forth.

202
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,560
Sweeping everything away, the old world's rules have begun to collapse.

203
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,160
Young forces strike powerfully, unstoppable, as lightning breaks through darkness.

204
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,079
Light shines brilliantly, leading the era, we:

205
00:03:31,079 --> 00:03:31,800
The world's rules are collapsing as young power emerges victoriously.

206
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,079

I've been waiting for you here.

238
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,760
Left or right?

239
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:59,480
Forward. Forward. Forward.

240
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,200
The little princess is finally here.

241
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,080
There are two dresses now.

242
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,730
Which one do you choose?

243
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,920
Where is the other one?

244
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,600
It's in your hands.

245
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,120
It's so beautiful.

246
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,679
This dress looks gorgeous.

247
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,480
This outfit is absolutely stunning.

248
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,800
I've never seen this kind of new dress before.

249
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,080
Me neither.

250
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,880
The wait was worth it.

251
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,680
It has a classical touch

252
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,400
and a modern style,

253
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,210
blending together perfectly.

254
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,360
Exactly,

255
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,490
and it's beautiful.

256
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,360
Yi Feng, are you happy today?

257
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,680
So all of this was for me.

258
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,400
I just want to tell you.

259
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:44,760
You're not who you used to be anymore.

260
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,520
Thank you, Lu Chen.

261
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,840
Because you're worth it.

262
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,720
You are the best Yi Feng in the world.

263
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,080
You are the perfect girl.

264
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,090
The best perfect girl in the world.

265
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,720
Will you be with me?

266
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,840
That's wonderful!

267
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:53,880
Congratulations!

268
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,560
Congratulations to you both!

00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,760
Congratulations!

270
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,040
Congratulations!

271
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,000
So romantic!

272
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,320
Yes, indeed.

273
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,000
So happy for you. Congratulations!

274
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,160
May you be happy forever!

275
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,680
That's wonderful!

276
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:08,000
It's Grandma calling.

277
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:12,800
Xiao Chen, I miss you so much!

278
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,400
Xiao Chen, I miss you so much!

279
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:16,440
We miss you too, Grandma.

280
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,760
Xiao Feng is here too?

281
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,680
How are you feeling, Grandma?

282
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,200
Seeing my grandchildren makes me

283
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,880
so happy!

284
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,680
When I come back next month, I'll cook something delicious for you.

285
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:35,560
Great.

286
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:40,080
Grandma, isn't our fashion show beautiful?

287
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,320
Look at the clothes we made. Aren't they beautiful?

288
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,280
The gold embroidery is so beautiful!

289
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,840
Let me tell you,

290
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,480
when I was young,

291
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,240
I wore this kind of dress when I got married.

292
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,920
This dress

293
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,840
is for Xiao Feng's future wedding, isn't it?

294
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,200
This is the biggest surprise you could give me!

295
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,040
I wish you happiness.

296
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,320
Take good care of yourselves.

297
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,240
See you in Guangzhou.

298
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:14,960
Bye-bye.

299
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,700
Thank you all for waiting.

300
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:24,040
The Gold Embroidery Fashion Show officially begins.

301
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,040

305
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,200
[Every beat, every step, this is my story, I no longer hide, boundaries blur, I control everything, rhythm burns, igniting my soul, breaking]

306
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,640
[Every step, this is my story, I no longer hide, boundaries blur, I control everything], rhythm burns, igniting my soul, breaking chains,

307
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,640

308
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:58,960

309
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,560

310
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,880
