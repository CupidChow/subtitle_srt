1
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,460
What's the matter?

2
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,050
Why do you need to tell me in person so late?

3
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,530
Have you seen Yi Feng recently?

4
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,400
I haven't seen her in the past couple of days.

5
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,840
I've been busy with the fashion show lately.

6
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,400
I was thinking since your studio just opened.

7
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,000
Yi Feng has lost her ability.

8
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,280
When did this happen?

9
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,210
Just yesterday.

10
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,880
She hit her head again.

11
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,120
After she woke up, her ability was gone.

12
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,800
I'm going to find her right now.

13
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,840
Have you thought about what to say?

14
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,200
You're just going to go like that?

15
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,759
Yi Feng has always lacked confidence.

16
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:55,400
And now with the studio just opening...

17
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,800
Losing her ability now is a huge blow to her.

18
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,560
What can I do about it?

19
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,740
I think we need to find a way

20
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,780
to make her realize how talented she already is.

21
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,080
Okay.

22
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,520
Mr. Lu.

23
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,880
The backstage testing is complete.

24
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,880
Everyone is entering the venue now.

25
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,360
All the invited guests are VIPs.

26
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,640
We can't make any mistakes.

27
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,520
Thank you all for your hard work.

28
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,560
Keep a close eye on everything.

29
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,160
Has the wardrobe been confirmed?

30
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:40,960
Yes, it has.

31
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,420
Chaoxu is supervising it.

32
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,060
Okay, got it. By the way...

33
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,560
I need to confirm your final speaking time.

34
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,760
Good, understood.

35
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,800
Okay.

36
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,560
Mr. Lu.

37
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,200
Teacher Qin, Mingyue.

38
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,000
Mr. Lu's execution ability is really impressive.

39
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,530
The concept we just mentioned has been implemented so quickly.

40
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,680
This is all thanks to Mingyue's ideas.

41
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:07,800
Where's Yi Feng?

42
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,520
Is she coming today?

43
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,120
I haven't seen her for a long time.

44
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,320
I miss her quite a bit.

45
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,680
She should be coming.

46
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:15,960
Please, come in.

47
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,840
Okay.

48
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,440
At such a critical moment,

49
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:41,000
I really have no ability left at all.

50
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,000
How am I going to explain this to Alex?

51
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,520
What are you thinking about?

52
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,290
Yi Feng really didn't come.

53
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,610
She's not answering her phone either.

54
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,160
Whatever you want to do,

55
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,560
I'll support you.

56
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,160
Just do as I say.

57
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,440
Next,

58
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,560
please welcome the director of the NS Fashion Agency's Gold Embroidery Project.

59
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,040
This is getting out of hand.

60
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,240
Come give us a speech.

61
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:43,000
Hello.

62
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,850
Excuse me, are you Miss Yi Feng?

63
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,680
Yes, that's me.

64
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,880
I have a package for you.

65
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,810
I've been trying to call you. It was driving me crazy.

66
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,040
I'm sorry.

67
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,840
Please show me your pickup code.

68
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,420
It's on your phone.

69
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,880
Let me search for it.

70
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:11,240
0903, 0903. Good.

71
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,640
Oh right.

72
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,330
There's also a message.

73
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,200
Are you ready to receive it?

74
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,000
Yi Feng,

75
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,720
today is a very special day for you.

76
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:40,010
The venue is nicely decorated.

77
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,159
Hello everyone, I'm Zhaoxu.

78
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,720
Next,

79
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,000
I'll be speaking on behalf of NS Director Lu Chen.

80
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,120
Because Director Lu has more important matters to attend to.

81
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,409
Where is Lu Chen?

82
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,820
How can someone else give his speech?

83
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,120
Today is a very important day for you.

84
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,880
It's your first project at NS

85
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,340
that's premiering today.

86
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,040
In this project,

87
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,140
you didn't use your superpowers.

88
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,040
These so-called superpowers

89
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,440
are nothing but fantasy or psychological suggestion.

90
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,120
And you've done an excellent job.

91
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,930
This demonstrates your own abilities and value.

92
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,520
It's also the result of your own hard work.

93
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,920
There's more.

94
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,970
Mr. Lu is a person who is extremely dedicated to his work.

95
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,000
He's also someone who

96
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,659
for causes he believes in, will spare no effort.

97
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,440
However, before today's opening,

98
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,920
he told me that a friend of his has experienced some difficulties.

99
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,760
To give this friend courage,

100
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,920
he has transferred today's speaking rights to me.

101
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,560
I believe

102
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,440
it's because this friend

103
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,080
has injected much vitality

104
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,760
into Mr. Lu's otherwise monotonous career path.

105
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,560
It's also because of this friend

106
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:22,140
that our show today has become possible.

107
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:25,680
I'm quite looking forward to

108
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,080
this friend attending the event in person.

109
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,690
Do you know who he's talking about?

110
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,760
Yi Feng. Why hasn't she arrived yet?

111
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,800
I remember you once doubted

112
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,760
when you said that wearing beautiful clothes

113
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:44,290
and putting on makeup doesn't necessarily make you beautiful.

114
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,840
You weren't sure if that version of yourself

115
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,360
was your true self.

116
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,360
I'm telling you now,

117
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,650
you were beautiful in that moment.

118
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,920
Even without beautiful clothes

119
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,280
or makeup, you're still beautiful.

120
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,560
Your kindness,

121
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:02,560
your diligence,

122
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,180
these are the ultimate secrets to your true beauty.

123
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:10,320
And it's because of you

124
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,940
that I've come to understand this truth.

125
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,920
So I sincerely hope

126
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,080
you can attend today's show.

127
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,200
Come see your own work.

128
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,360
Without you here,

129
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,200
the show won't begin.

130
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:36,760
How did you...

131
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,360
How are you talking just like Lu Chen?

132
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,680
I imitated him myself.

133
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:46,760
Yes.

134
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,140
There's one more line.

135
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,360
Your Lu Chen.

136
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,600
That's the last line.

137
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,400
Nothing more.

138
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:00,420
How many points would you give me?

139
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,680
How about a five-star review?

140
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,160
Thank you.

141
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,680
Thanks.

142
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:16,290
Right, there's still a bag.

143
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,180
Okay, I won't disturb you anymore. Goodbye.

144
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,000
Now I will read to everyone

145
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,360
the speech entrusted to me by Director Lu.

146
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,050
Hello everyone.

147
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,480
I am Lu Chen, Director of NS Fashion Agency.

148
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,720
This show is my first

149
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,640
to incorporate Chinese traditional elements

150
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,480
since joining NS.

151
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,720
Gold nail embroidery has a long history.

152
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:01,120
It's an ancient craft in traditional Cantonese embroidery.

153
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,960
In the past, when girls from Guangzhou got married,

154
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,090
they would wear gold nail embroidery.

155
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,260
It was handmade by their mothers,

156
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,640
passing parents' blessings to their daughters.

157
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,800
Are you Miss Yi Feng?

158
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,360
Yes.

159
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:31,200
Hello, I'm Alex.

160
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,400
Hello, Alex.

161
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,240
Miss Yi Feng.

162
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,400
Regarding your studio,

163
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,400
we've done some research.

164
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,380
We're quite optimistic about this project.

165
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,000
And your partners

166
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,400
are quite promising in the industry.

167
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,400
I'm sorry,

168
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,560
but I have an urgent matter to attend to.

169
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,020
Are you going to see Mr. Lu?

170
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,320
You know Lu Chen?

171
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,560
Please, sit down. I want to show you something.

172
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,640
Did Lu Chen send you to find me?

173
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:01,680
Sit down first.

174
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,200
You'll know soon enough.

175
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,360
Wishing today's gold embroidery show a complete success.

176
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,200
Thank you all.

177
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,600
That was Mr. Lu Chen's entire speech.

178
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,840
Now, before the show officially begins,

179
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,690
let's all look forward to the arrival of this special guest.

180
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,120
What is Lu Chen up to?

181
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,580
He's disappeared.

182
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,320
Isn't this just nonsense?

183
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,240
Don't talk nonsense if you don't understand.

184
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,840
I think this Lu Chen

185
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,360
is quite a man.

186
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,600
So now we can talk about

187
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,520
your studio, shall we?

188
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,400
Our company has reviewed some of your information

189
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,600
and we find you quite unique

190
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,450
and are very interested in you.

191
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,760
I...

192
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,160
I may have already lost

193
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,220
whatever it was that interested you.

194
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:01,040
Don't you want to continue

195
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,140
working in the fashion industry?

196
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,040
It's not that.

197
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,880
I just don't have the ability anymore.

198
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:09,600
Ability?

199
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,610
What ability are you referring to?

200
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,320
Isn't my ability what you're interested in?

201
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,250
Here, take a look at this first.

202
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,570
My biennial exhibition was a success.

203
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:28,640
It received support from all sectors of society.

204
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,720
I want to thank someone special.

205
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:34,200
She helped me, helped us

206
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,240
to focus on forgotten children.

207
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:39,720
She gave my work greater social significance.

208
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,200
This person is Ms. Yi Feng.

209
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,800
Do you know Lu Chen?

210
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,530
These materials were indeed given to me by Mr. Lu.

211
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,920
He's our partner.

212
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,010
I'm currently holding his shares.

213
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,880
So Lu Chen asked you to invest in my studio?

214
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,480
Yes, but not entirely.

215
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,040
Mr. Lu recommended your project to us.

216
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,720
We've done our own evaluation

217
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,780
and feel it has great investment potential.

218
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,720
What about these videos?

219
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,320
The videos were also provided by Mr. Lu.

220
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,200
And he told me the story between you two

221
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,700
which moved me deeply.

222
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,080
So, Ms. Yi Feng,

223
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,600
this is your personal charm.

224
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,740
Are you still worried about your abilities now?

225
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,640
I...

226
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,160
Can I really do this?

227
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,000
What others say doesn't matter.

228
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,120
The key is that you need confidence in yourself.

229
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,370
Here's to a pleasant cooperation.

230
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,200
Thank you for your trust.

231
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,400
You should go find Mr. Lu now.

232
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,460
He's probably still waiting for you.

233
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,760
Wait.

234
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,800
Take this.

235
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,080
Take care. I'll be waiting for you to sign the contract.
