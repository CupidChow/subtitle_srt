1
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,330
I actually came here today to confess my feelings to you.

2
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,280
But I don't even recognize you anymore.

3
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,240
What do you mean?

4
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:23,640
Li.

5
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,360
I dressed up the way you like.

6
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,240
Do you like how you look now?

7
00:01:32,039 --> 00:01:34,200
Do you like who you've become?

8
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,520
I don't know.

9
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,210
Then come back when you've figured it out.

10
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,039
Why did he run away?

11
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:46,000
Manman, wait for us!

12
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,640
She's crying.

13
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,240
I just heard Li say that Manman

14
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,770
isn't acting like herself.

15
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,360
So Manman ran away crying.

16
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,200
I'll go with Chacha to check on her first,

17
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,600
and then we'll wait for you by the car later.

18
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,039
I just heard Li say

19
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,720
that Manman isn't acting like herself.

20
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,180
So Manman ran away crying.

21
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,040
I'll go with Chacha to check on her first,

22
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,440
and then we'll wait for you by the car later.

23
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,120
It's all fate.

24
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,400
Are you leaving tonight?

25
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,360
Then I need to catch a ride with you.

26
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,200
Oh.

27
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,900
Is the car parked here?

28
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,400
They wouldn't have ditched us, would they?

29
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,480
Don't worry, I'll call Zhaoxu.

30
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,600
I'll call too.

31
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,079
Zhaoxu isn't answering.

32
00:02:55,079 --> 00:02:56,880
Chacha isn't answering either.

33
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,100
I'll try again.

34
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:58,720
Chacha...

35
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,520
No answer.

36
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,720
Looks like we're not leaving tonight.

37
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,520
Ah!

38
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,400
What do you mean there are no rooms left?

39
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,760
I'm sorry, ma'am.

40
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,200
Due to tonight's thunderstorm,

41
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,240
many guests who were supposed to check out

42
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,480
have decided to stay.

43
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,000
We only have one king-size room left now.

44
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,400
Would you like to take it?

45
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,640
Why don't you shower first?

46
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,680
You go first.

47
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:15,280
Did you hear that?

48
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,740
That crying sound?

49
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,440
It's probably just the wind.

50
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,600
It's not the wind. It's crying,

51
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,840
a woman's crying.

52
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,090
You must be hearing things.

53
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,600
I'm not hearing things.

54
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,000
It's definitely crying.

55
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,200
Hey.

56
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,570
Where are you going?

57
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,000
What's wrong?

58
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,360
I'm scared.

59
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,159
Let's cover this up then.

60
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,040
Are you still scared now?

61
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,600
Are you still afraid now?

62
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,520
So are you still frightened now?

63
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:40,490
I'm not scared anymore.

64
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,159
Who is it?

65
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,720
Lu Chen and Yi Feng.

66
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,560
I feel terrible.

67
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,560
Li Buou and I grew up together on the island.

68
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,760
But he got accepted to study abroad.

69
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:57,320
My dad said I could go with him if I wanted to.

70
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,610
I wanted to confess my feelings to him.

71
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,240
So I asked other boys

72
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,560
what type of girls they liked.

73
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,560
They said they liked pretty girls.

74
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,240
Like Chacha.

75
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,240
So I made myself look like Chacha.

76
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,260
And went to confess to him.

77
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,760
Li Buou.

78
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,800
His name is quite cute.

79
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,240
Then today when Li Buou saw me,

80
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,120
he said he couldn't recognize me.

81
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,920
Was it really that dramatic?

82
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,480
Li Buou asked me

83
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,200
if I liked how I looked now.

84
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,600
I said I didn't know.

85
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,720
Then he told me to figure it out before coming back to him.

86
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,320
Is it possible you misheard him?

87
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,120
Impossible.

88
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,640
Absolutely not.

89
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,200
My heart is breaking.

90
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,320
Do you think Li Bu'ou likes Manman?

91
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,320
He does.

92
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,640
Why?

93
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:11,600
When he confessed, he didn't say 'I don't like you.'

94
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,180
So that means he likes her.

95
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:25,160
Isn't that a bit too absolute?

96
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,280
Today at 3 p.m.

97
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,860
It's the hottest time of day here.

98
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,890
Li Bu'ou is willing to stay with her in the scorching sun.

99
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,200
Don't you think that's what liking someone means?

100
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:56,520
But aren't you also here with me in the sun?

101
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:22,540
How do I pick a coconut?

102
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,040
It's like opening a mystery box.

103
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,080
There's actually nothing to choose from.

104
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,640
Then what are you filming here?

105
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,970
Just filming whatever.

106
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,280
Wait a second.

107
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,970
Are you going to find Lu Manman?

108
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,240
Who are you?

109
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,240
I've known Li Bu'ou since we were kids.

110
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,640
But he got into a school abroad.

111
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,680
He'll be surrounded by countless beautiful women.

112
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,800
And then he'll forget about me.

113
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,240
Don't cry, don't cry.

114
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,820
That won't happen.

115
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,480
Why did you come?

116
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,520
Why are you crying so hard?

117
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,400
Didn't you reject me?

118
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,040
When did I ever reject you?

119
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,000
I confessed to you and you never accepted.

120
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,800
Isn't that rejecting me?

121
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:26,680
You're making excuses asking if I like you this way.

122
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,760
I like you for who you really are.

123
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,640
What about now?

124
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,840
I barely recognize you now.

125
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,200
Are you crazy?

126
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,680
I can change back to how I was.

127
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,600
Alright, don't cry.

128
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,660
That guy told me not to make someone I care about cry.

129
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:51,840
Stop crying.

130
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:52,960
It's okay.

131
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,180
Why do you care about me and Lu Manman?

132
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,920
I don't want to get involved either.

133
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,920
But the person you like is affecting the person I like.

134
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,560
What? She's hugging her and talking non-stop.

135
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,160
She won't even let her sleep.

136
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,480
I just want to tell you.

137
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,120
If you like a girl,

138
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,370
don't make her cry for you all the time.

139
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:15,480
I didn't mean to.

140
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:18,080
Go find her.

141
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:23,760
Okay, promise me you'll be yourself.

142
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,200
Come on, stop crying.

143
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,960
I want to go home.

144
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,080
Let's go back then.

145
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,440
Hello! You finally answered the phone.

146
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,640
Where did you guys go?

147
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,320
Teacher Chaoxu said you two were in the car yesterday.

148
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,380
I didn't look back.

149
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,440
We were already on the highway when I realized you two weren't in the car.

150
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,300
And you're asking me where I went?

151
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,600
I think you guys are just messing with me.

152
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,600
I'm so done with this.

153
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,640
What the hell are you guys doing?

154
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,970
Why did you leave first?

155
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,880
I didn't go anywhere!

156
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,960
Chacha got in the car and said you were in the back seat.

157
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,440
We were already halfway down the highway.

158
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,920
Then I looked back and you two were gone.

159
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,850
What's going on?

160
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,120
I really can't believe this.

161
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:16,920
I just...

162
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,600
You're so smart.

163
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,960
Don't play dumb with me.

164
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,160
You just accepted all my clues without question?

165
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,920
Come back soon.

166
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,400
I'll treat you to dinner.

167
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,480
I'm going to deal with her. Where is she?

168
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,240
Welcome back.

169
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,920
You must be tired from your journey.

170
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,600
Chacha, you're in big trouble.

171
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,240
Just wait and see what I'll do to you.

172
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,300
Yifeng, I'm sorry! Stop right there!

173
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,160
You little brat!

174
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,560
Mr. Lu, you're looking well.

175
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,080
Looking well? Not at all.

176
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,160
The long journey nearly killed me.

177
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,280
Chaoxu, help me quickly!

178
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,450
Help me, please!

179
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,280
Alright, everyone sit down.

180
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,520
I'm starving.

181
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,280
Let's order quickly.

182
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,880
I'm going to eat you both under the table today.

183
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,170
Come on, have a seat.

184
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:14,320
I've already ordered the food.

185
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,520
