11
00:01:11,187 --> 00:01:12,546
Young lady, it's me.

12
00:01:14,667 --> 00:01:15,707
Why you are here?

13
00:01:15,827 --> 00:01:17,026
I came to get you out.

14
00:01:18,107 --> 00:01:19,466
I'll go distract the guards first.

15
00:01:25,146 --> 00:01:26,267
Yuwen Que.

16
00:01:28,747 --> 00:01:31,147
I will take your life with my own hands.

17
00:01:32,866 --> 00:01:34,306
With your blood,

18
00:01:34,307 --> 00:01:36,067
I will offer it to my mother.

19
00:01:37,066 --> 00:01:39,227
I won't let anyone else do it.

20
00:01:46,027 --> 00:01:47,386
(If you really dare to die,)

21
00:01:47,706 --> 00:01:50,267
(I'll make sure you find
no peace even in the afterlife.)

22
00:01:55,146 --> 00:01:56,067
Who's there?

23
00:01:57,747 --> 00:01:59,106
Your Ladyship, where are you going?

24
00:01:59,107 --> 00:01:59,906
Kill me if you want.

25
00:01:59,907 --> 00:02:00,907
Do as you please.

26
00:02:00,947 --> 00:02:03,586
But if you want to catch me,
first see if your lives allow it.

27
00:02:03,747 --> 00:02:05,347
Then don't blame me for being rude.

28
00:02:10,866 --> 00:02:11,625
You...

29
00:02:11,626 --> 00:02:14,147
What? Do you think my death
isn't real enough?

30
00:02:27,106 --> 00:02:28,266
Such a vicious heart.

31
00:02:28,386 --> 00:02:30,440
You even spread the news
that you had died in battle.

32
00:02:32,307 --> 00:02:33,507
I'm here, aren't I?

33
00:02:34,386 --> 00:02:35,787
I knew you would worry about me.

34
00:02:36,027 --> 00:02:37,266
Who's worried about you?

35
00:02:37,267 --> 00:02:38,307
I just...

36
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:40,146
I'm afraid you'd die too easily.

37
00:02:40,147 --> 00:02:41,587
Don't make me worry again.

38
00:02:41,747 --> 00:02:42,507
I'll take you away.

39
00:02:43,267 --> 00:02:44,065
They're over here.

40
00:02:44,066 --> 00:02:44,666
Quick.

41
00:02:47,946 --> 00:02:49,587
Remember the sword technique
I taught you?

42
00:02:49,667 --> 00:02:50,266
I remember.

43
00:02:50,267 --> 00:02:52,027
- Let's fight our way out together.
- Alright.

44
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,266
You brought me here.

45
00:03:15,307 --> 00:03:17,067
Do you remember this place?

46
00:03:29,427 --> 00:03:31,507
Always doing such tacky things.

47
00:03:31,587 --> 00:03:33,067
And yet you're smiling so happily.

48
00:03:33,106 --> 00:03:34,266
Am I?

49
00:03:43,027 --> 00:03:44,146
Why

50
00:03:44,946 --> 00:03:46,507
are you so close to me?

51
00:03:46,707 --> 00:03:47,826
Naturally,

52
00:03:49,307 --> 00:03:50,627
I have improper thoughts.

53
00:03:54,066 --> 00:03:55,587
Since the moment I met you,

54
00:03:56,826 --> 00:03:58,266
you've belonged to me.

55
00:03:59,226 --> 00:04:00,546
Where else are you going?

56
00:04:01,747 --> 00:04:02,866
Sweet talk.

It will.

60
00:04:15,226 --> 00:04:15,946
I promise you.

61
00:04:17,467 --> 00:04:18,666
I will protect you in this life.

62
00:04:19,506 --> 00:04:22,311

I never thought the Mobei Crown Prince

68
00:04:46,067 --> 00:04:48,506
would remember
such trivial romantic things.

69
00:04:48,507 --> 00:04:50,106
I remember everything about you.

70
00:04:50,426 --> 00:04:51,426
But unfortunately,

71
00:04:51,947 --> 00:04:53,506
it's all fake.

72
00:04:53,986 --> 00:04:54,827
Is it?

73
00:04:55,507 --> 00:04:56,866
Then why did you save me?

74
00:04:57,067 --> 00:04:57,706
Let go.

75
00:04:57,707 --> 00:05:00,586
You knew there was an ambush.
Why did you rush out to warn me anyway?

76
00:05:00,587 --> 00:05:01,587
I told you,

77
00:05:02,346 --> 00:05:03,746
I will kill you with my own hands.

78
00:05:05,827 --> 00:05:06,907
My Ru

79
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:08,745
still so stubborn.

80
00:05:08,746 --> 00:05:10,027
Don't call me that.

81
00:05:10,546 --> 00:05:12,266
Ru who foolishly trusted you

82
00:05:12,267 --> 00:05:13,467
is already dead.

83
00:05:15,986 --> 00:05:17,506
But my Ru is still alive,

84
00:05:18,186 --> 00:05:19,106
right here.

85
00:05:19,866 --> 00:05:20,947
You liar.

86
00:05:21,746 --> 00:05:22,746
Give me a chance.

87
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:25,227
Let me explain everything.

88
00:05:26,387 --> 00:05:27,827
Just like that time by the river,

89
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:30,106
we spoke about everything.

90
00:05:30,907 --> 00:05:31,707
It's too late.

91
00:05:31,947 --> 00:05:34,426
As long as you still care about me,
it's not too late.

92
00:06:01,507 --> 00:06:02,225
Chase!

93
00:06:02,226 --> 00:06:03,986
They're here, hurry!

94
00:06:07,546 --> 00:06:08,746
There's a boat over there.

95
00:06:17,226 --> 00:06:18,227
They're trying to escape!

96
00:06:18,587 --> 00:06:19,186
Chase!

97
00:06:26,226 --> 00:06:27,707
How could

98
00:06:28,866 --> 00:06:31,665
my daughter escape right
under your eyes?

99
00:06:31,666 --> 00:06:32,787
Your Majesty,

100
00:06:33,186 --> 00:06:34,946
she was kidnapped by Yuwen Que's men.

101
00:06:34,947 --> 00:06:36,347
Yuwen Que?

102
00:06:39,786 --> 00:06:41,666
So it's Yuwen Que.

103
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:44,426
Send orders to the shadow guards.

104
00:06:45,707 --> 00:06:46,506
Yes.

105
00:06:46,786 --> 00:06:48,466
Eliminate Yuwen Que

106
00:06:48,467 --> 00:06:50,105
at all costs.

107
00:06:50,106 --> 00:06:51,186
Yes.

108
00:06:51,907 --> 00:06:52,827
Then...

109
00:06:53,346 --> 00:06:54,426
What about the princess?

110
00:06:54,546 --> 00:06:56,267
Better to capture her alive.

111
00:06:56,986 --> 00:06:58,720
If that's impossible,

112
00:06:58,746 --> 00:06:59,666
kill her.

113
00:07:00,426 --> 00:07:01,266
No mercy.

114
00:07:01,267 --> 00:07:02,466
Your Majesty, Madam back then...

115
00:07:02,467 --> 00:07:03,267
Silence!

116
00:07:04,786 --> 00:07:07,757
I will never let Mobei
use this against us.

117
00:07:08,346 --> 00:07:09,906
If it comes to that,

118
00:07:09,907 --> 00:07:12,845
I must personally eliminate
this weakness.

119
00:07:29,546 --> 00:07:30,545
We're temporarily safe.

120
00:07:30,546 --> 00:07:31,436
I don't think so.

121
00:07:31,437 --> 00:07:32,132
Wait.

122
00:07:34,546 --> 00:07:35,227
Hold on.

123
00:07:35,546 --> 00:07:36,865
I am the Princess of Cangzhou.

124
00:07:36,866 --> 00:07:37,666
Princess?

125
00:07:38,226 --> 00:07:39,626
Then you should die even more.

126
00:07:39,866 --> 00:07:40,866
If you want to touch her,

127
00:07:41,147 --> 00:07:42,225
you must get past me first.

128
00:07:42,226 --> 00:07:43,666
They're not from Cangzhou.

129
00:07:48,407 --> 00:07:50,066
He's using his left hand
to wield the sword.

130
00:07:50,312 --> 00:07:53,146
Young lady, this token is exclusive
to the Mobei royal family.

131
00:07:53,147 --> 00:07:56,545
I just checked. The madam and the young master
were injured by the soft sword.

132
00:07:56,546 --> 00:07:58,557
The assassin used right-hand
sword techniques.

133
00:08:01,907 --> 00:08:03,666
The Crown Prince's soft sword skill

134
00:08:03,707 --> 00:08:05,866
seems different from the rumors.

135
00:08:05,947 --> 00:08:07,587
That's because your experience
is limited.

136
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:14,746
No.

137
00:08:15,306 --> 00:08:16,467
Completely wrong.

138
00:08:16,986 --> 00:08:18,626
But back then the sword technique

139
00:08:19,267 --> 00:08:20,866
was clearly right-handed.

140
00:08:21,346 --> 00:08:22,426
Could it be

141
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:23,626
Yuwen Que?

142
00:08:24,546 --> 00:08:25,827
You fool.

143
00:08:26,707 --> 00:08:28,587
If you had really killed back then,

144
00:08:28,986 --> 00:08:31,787
why did you shield me
from the sword again and again?

145
00:08:32,306 --> 00:08:33,347
All these years,

146
00:08:33,426 --> 00:08:35,147
have I misjudged you?

147
00:08:35,346 --> 00:08:36,546
Does it matter?

148
00:08:37,387 --> 00:08:38,425
As long as you're fine.

149
00:08:38,426 --> 00:08:39,506
Why?

150
00:08:39,627 --> 00:08:41,467
Why did you bear all this?

151
00:08:41,747 --> 00:08:43,120
I want you to survive.

152
00:08:43,987 --> 00:08:44,705
Today,

153
00:08:44,706 --> 00:08:46,146
you won't escape even with wings.

154
00:08:46,147 --> 00:08:47,227
Attack!

155
00:08:52,227 --> 00:08:53,347
Take Young Lady Shen away.

156
00:08:54,387 --> 00:08:55,106
Go!

157
00:09:05,147 --> 00:09:06,347
Are you alright?

158
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:07,347
Chase!

159
00:09:07,426 --> 00:09:08,665
They must be not far ahead.

160
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:09,585
You go first.

161
00:09:09,586 --> 00:09:10,465
Don't worry about me.

162
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:11,427
Don't be reckless.

163
00:09:11,507 --> 00:09:12,857
If I die, we die together.

164
00:09:26,306 --> 00:09:27,947
You knew all along, didn't you?

165
00:09:29,826 --> 00:09:30,947
I only know

166
00:09:32,107 --> 00:09:34,067
if you had wanted to harm us back then,

167
00:09:35,425 --> 00:09:37,220
you wouldn't have let me live until now.

168
00:09:40,627 --> 00:09:42,746
Yet I still couldn't save your mother.

169
00:09:44,987 --> 00:09:46,467
I'm sorry, Ru.

170
00:09:53,706 --> 00:09:55,106
Ru, are you alright?

171
00:10:01,586 --> 00:10:02,427
This time,

172
00:10:03,826 --> 00:10:05,427
I will protect you completely.

173
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:06,870
Yuwen Que.

174
00:10:08,267 --> 00:10:09,386
Do you know?

175
00:10:10,466 --> 00:10:12,427
I have countless times

176
00:10:14,066 --> 00:10:15,746
wanted to kill you with my own hands.

177
00:10:16,347 --> 00:10:17,295
I know.

178
00:10:18,227 --> 00:10:20,626
But I could never bring myself
to be cruel.

179
00:10:22,186 --> 00:10:23,746
This is probably

180
00:10:24,507 --> 00:10:26,026
my greatest weakness.

181
00:10:33,027 --> 00:10:34,587
This is our shared stubbornness.

182
00:10:42,946 --> 00:10:43,906
Inside.

183
00:10:51,925 --> 00:10:52,900
Wait.

184
00:10:54,747 --> 00:10:55,746
With this jade in hand,

185
00:10:55,907 --> 00:10:56,945
do you remember

186
00:10:56,946 --> 00:10:58,067
whose token this is?

187
00:10:58,946 --> 00:11:00,307
Tonight, we'll clean

188
00:11:00,387 --> 00:11:02,427
Cangzhou's blood all in one go.

189
00:11:02,627 --> 00:11:03,707
If you want to touch her,
