Yuwen Que.

Yuwen Que.

14
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,030
No. It's too dangerous.

15
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:33,110
You shouldn't have come.

16
00:01:34,309 --> 00:01:35,269
Go. Now.

17
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:36,869
What's between us

18
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,830
is not for you to judge.

19
00:01:43,669 --> 00:01:47,830
Never thought the Crown Prince of Mobei

20
00:01:48,829 --> 00:01:50,470
would end up like this.

21
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:58,830
Why are your hands so cold?

22
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,870
Was it worth it

23
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:04,230

24
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,349

00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:09,509

26
00:02:11,829 --> 00:02:13,069
It's too dangerous.

27
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,669
Go!

28
00:02:15,029 --> 00:02:16,190

29
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,150

00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:20,470
I won't let anyone take you away.

32
00:02:23,749 --> 00:02:27,270

00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:30,949

what's the most ridiculous thing
in this world?

36
00:02:34,589 --> 00:02:37,109
Everyone keeps deciding for me,

37
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:40,261

How are you?

49
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:43,310
Qingru.

50
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:46,109
Qingru.

51
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:47,829
What nonsense are you talking about now?

52
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,550
The boat courtesan.

53
00:03:50,909 --> 00:03:52,550
Protect the boat courtesan.

54
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,710
Qingru's mother.

55
00:03:55,749 --> 00:03:57,069
What did you say?

56
00:03:59,029 --> 00:04:00,270
I'm sorry.

57
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,949
I failed to save her.

58
00:04:05,589 --> 00:04:06,710
So,

59
00:04:07,909 --> 00:04:09,349
all these years,

60
00:04:10,509 --> 00:04:13,629
I blamed the one person
who tried to save my mother.

61
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:16,629
Qingru.

62
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:19,629
I'm sorry.

63
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:21,109
I...

64
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:22,269
Enough.

65
00:04:22,709 --> 00:04:24,670
What do you have to apologize for?

66
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:27,149
I'm the one who should say sorry.

67
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:29,069
Qingru.

68
00:04:29,949 --> 00:04:31,670
You shouldn't cry.

69
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:33,550
Who's crying?

70
00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:37,069
You'd better stay alive.

71
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:41,110
We'll clear up
our misunderstandings slowly.

72
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,750
We'll be trapped here tonight.

73
00:04:45,149 --> 00:04:47,069
You'd better stay strong.

74
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:49,350
Don't die in my arms.

75
00:04:50,829 --> 00:04:51,949
If like this,

76
00:04:52,509 --> 00:04:54,069
I could die without regret.

77
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:55,670
Yuwen Que.

78
00:04:56,069 --> 00:04:57,750
I won't allow you to die.

79
00:04:58,309 --> 00:04:59,670
If you die,

80
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:01,589
who will I take revenge on?

81
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:02,388
I still...

82
00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:03,269
I still...

83
00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:06,069
Yuwen Que.

84
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:07,509
Yuwen Que.

85
00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:09,550
Yuwen Que.

86
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:33,429
This...

87
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:33,948
This...

88
00:05:33,949 --> 00:05:35,149
Young master, this is...

89
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:36,308
One best room.

90
00:05:36,309 --> 00:05:37,429
The quietest one.

91
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:38,349
Alright, this way.

92
00:05:38,350 --> 00:05:39,509
This way.

93
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:41,870
This is it.

94
00:05:57,309 --> 00:05:58,350
This wound...

95
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:01,629
He's been poisoned by the deadly
Turning Rain Swallow.

96
00:06:01,949 --> 00:06:03,269
How do you know?

97
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:08,629
Ten years ago,
my son died from this poison.

98
00:06:08,749 --> 00:06:11,269
But he should still be saved.

99
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:12,589
Speak.

100
00:06:12,709 --> 00:06:15,550
Thirty li from here lies
a Medicine Valley.

101
00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:19,509
Within it is a supreme antidote called
the Nine-Tailed Lotus.

102
00:06:19,749 --> 00:06:22,910
Medicine Valley?
Why have I never heard of it?

103
00:06:24,149 --> 00:06:27,870
Most people who go to that valley
never come back.

104
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:32,949
The master of the Medicine Valley
is the Medicine Valley Immortal.

105
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:34,629
The Medicine Valley Immortal?

106
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,029
Yes.

107
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:39,110
I met him once 30 years ago.

108
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:43,029
He looked exactly the same
as he does now.

109
00:06:43,030 --> 00:06:44,310
Please, tell me more.

110
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:48,388
It's said the Immortal
is over 90 years old,

111
00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:50,709
yet his face remains that of a child.

112
00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:53,188
The valley is filled
with rare medicinal herbs,

113
00:06:53,189 --> 00:06:54,310
and he

114
00:06:54,709 --> 00:06:57,469
is especially skilled
in preserving youth.

115
00:06:57,709 --> 00:06:59,469
Over 90 years old.

116
00:06:59,709 --> 00:07:03,629
Young lady, do you know why he
lives alone in the Medicine Valley?

117
00:07:04,829 --> 00:07:06,550
He is waiting for someone.

118
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:09,310
Someone who can unravel
the mystery of the valley.

119
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:10,549
Then I want to see

120
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:13,110
how mysterious this Medicine Valley
truly is.

121
00:07:13,629 --> 00:07:14,870
You must not go.

122
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,469
You have no right to say that now.

123
00:07:22,949 --> 00:07:24,469
It's too dangerous.

124
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:26,629
Show me the route.

125
00:07:26,709 --> 00:07:27,880
Leave the city heading west.

126
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,680
When you reach a cliff
and see an ancient pine,

127
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,880
that will be the valley entrance.

128
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,909
But young lady,
you must be very careful.

129
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:35,230
That Immortal is unpredictable.

130
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:37,948
Before meeting anyone,
he always tests them three times.

131
00:07:37,949 --> 00:07:39,308
Then I shall see

132
00:07:39,309 --> 00:07:41,709
exactly who the Immortal is waiting for.

133
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,230
Take good care of him.

134
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:51,149
Slow down.

135
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:10,870
Are you a guest from Cangzhou?

136
00:08:11,509 --> 00:08:12,910
Then let me ask,

137
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,308
how did you know?

138
00:08:14,309 --> 00:08:17,310
The jade you carry
bears the aura of Cangzhou.

139
00:08:17,749 --> 00:08:19,069
It's been 50 years.

140
00:08:19,389 --> 00:08:21,269
At last, I've waited for a clever one.

141
00:08:22,509 --> 00:08:23,629
Is that so?

142
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:25,789
What makes me special?

143
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:26,989
What do you think?

144
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:31,148
What kind of person inspires a dying man

145
00:08:31,149 --> 00:08:32,750
to willingly take a blade for her?

146
00:08:33,709 --> 00:08:35,069
To save that man,

147
00:08:35,189 --> 00:08:36,589
you must pass three trials.

148
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:38,110
You really know how to test people.

149
00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:41,709
(Ordinary petals)

150
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:42,949
(cannot harm anyone.)

151
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,748
(But among countless petals,)

152
00:08:44,749 --> 00:08:47,628
(hides one red Spider Lily
that can take a life.)

153
00:08:47,629 --> 00:08:49,589
(Find that Spider Lily,)

154
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:50,869
(and you pass.)

155
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:52,148
(But if you choose wrongly,)

156
00:08:52,149 --> 00:08:54,748
(then your soul shall depart in regret.)

157
00:08:54,749 --> 00:08:55,829
Begin.

158
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:56,829
(Do you know)

159
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,109
(that 20 years ago,)

160
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:00,388
(a woman very much like you
once came here?)

161
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:01,510
A woman?

162
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:04,829
(Unfortunately,
she never found the Spider Lily.)

163
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:07,229
(I wonder if you'll repeat her fate.)

164
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:09,309
(Time limit is one incense stick.)

165
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:12,150
(Choose wrong, and you die.)

166
00:09:12,669 --> 00:09:13,829
Begin.

167
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:16,550
(Interesting.)

168
00:09:16,909 --> 00:09:19,670
(Your eyes are exactly like hers.)

169
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:22,069
Her?

170
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:24,229
(The woman who came
seeking the Nine-Tailed Lotus)

171
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:26,469
(to save her husband.)

172
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:30,069
(It's a pity,
she was too focused on saving him)

173
00:09:30,149 --> 00:09:32,510
(and overlooked what mattered most.)

174
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:40,469
Found it.

175
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,030
Why this one?

176
00:09:42,149 --> 00:09:44,430
Everyone is searching
for the red Spider Lily,

177
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:45,829
yet they don't realize

178
00:09:45,830 --> 00:09:47,148
the deadliest poison

179
00:09:47,149 --> 00:09:49,589
is often hidden
beneath the most ordinary surface.

180
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:52,630
Interesting.
As expected of her daughter.

181
00:09:59,389 --> 00:10:01,189
The woman you mentioned earlier...

182
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:02,748
You resemble her,

183
00:10:02,749 --> 00:10:04,309
but not entirely.

184
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:06,109
She trusted people too easily,

185
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:09,508
while your heart is filled
with hidden blades.

186
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:11,229
You seem to know me well.

187
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:13,030
The second trial has arrived.

188
00:10:13,389 --> 00:10:16,030
There is a White Jade Butterfly
in that forest.

189
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:19,709
Find it, and you will learn
all that you seek.

190
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:20,790
What's the condition?

191
00:10:21,149 --> 00:10:22,309
No condition.

192
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:23,829
Only this forest.

193
00:10:24,509 --> 00:10:27,630
It will show you the past
you least wish to face.

194
00:10:27,749 --> 00:10:29,709
Are you ready?

195
00:10:29,789 --> 00:10:31,030
I'm already here.

196
00:10:31,149 --> 00:10:32,469
I will not retreat.

197
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,430
I hope you can endure it.

198
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:37,748
This forest

199
00:10:37,749 --> 00:10:39,949
reflects the deepest secrets
of one's heart.

200
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:41,109
Good luck.

201
00:10:50,389 --> 00:10:51,550
(Found you.)

202
00:10:51,669 --> 00:10:52,869
(So this is where you were.)

203
00:10:53,029 --> 00:10:55,270
(I must catch
this White Jade Butterfly.)
