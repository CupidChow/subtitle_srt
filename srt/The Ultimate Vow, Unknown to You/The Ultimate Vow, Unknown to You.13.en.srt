11
00:01:19,425 --> 00:01:23,136
(A Celestial Realm of Joy)

12
00:01:23,137 --> 00:01:25,507
We have a few skilled performers today.

13
00:01:25,525 --> 00:01:27,445
Please enjoy yourselves.

14
00:01:33,177 --> 00:01:35,136
Young Lady Shen, bear with it for now.

15
00:01:35,137 --> 00:01:38,407
You'll need to smile beautifully later.

16
00:01:48,417 --> 00:01:49,236
Your Ladyship,

17
00:01:49,237 --> 00:01:50,256
everything is ready.

18
00:01:50,257 --> 00:01:51,870
The final show

19
00:01:52,617 --> 00:01:54,058
is about to begin.

20
00:02:03,137 --> 00:02:03,978
Isn't that

21
00:02:04,378 --> 00:02:06,297
Madam Su?

22
00:02:12,787 --> 00:02:14,427
A boat courtesan's daughter.

23
00:02:14,778 --> 00:02:17,286
She's indeed inherited
her mother's lowly fate.

24
00:02:17,287 --> 00:02:18,406
True, though.

25
00:02:18,658 --> 00:02:20,482
She's probably trying to return

26
00:02:20,537 --> 00:02:22,418
to where she truly belongs.

27
00:02:23,587 --> 00:02:25,016
Wasn't your mother

28
00:02:25,017 --> 00:02:26,818
climbing her way up

29
00:02:26,912 --> 00:02:28,273
with her face

30
00:02:29,178 --> 00:02:30,497
and her body?

31
00:02:30,498 --> 00:02:32,777
Your Ladyship, you seem to know
my mother's past very well.

32
00:02:32,778 --> 00:02:35,138
Did you investigate for a long time?

33
00:02:36,378 --> 00:02:38,420
For today's show,

34
00:02:38,898 --> 00:02:40,870
you planned all this long ago.

35
00:02:41,457 --> 00:02:43,007
The drug is ready.

36
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,432
The stage is set.

37
00:02:45,577 --> 00:02:48,620
All that's left is to put me on display.

38
00:02:48,818 --> 00:02:50,136
Do you all know

39
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:51,456
why the Princess

40
00:02:51,457 --> 00:02:53,407
brought me onto this stage tonight?

41
00:02:55,737 --> 00:02:57,657
I knew you'd use this trick.

42
00:02:57,658 --> 00:02:58,749
That's why

43
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,230
I've been waiting here.

44
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,082
The Breath-Holding Technique
lies in calming the mind.

45
00:03:04,898 --> 00:03:06,832
Feel the flow of breath in your body.

46
00:03:07,297 --> 00:03:08,107
Yes.

47
00:03:08,778 --> 00:03:09,757
Like that.

48
00:03:09,818 --> 00:03:12,897
But my heart

49
00:03:13,618 --> 00:03:15,017
won't calm down.

50
00:03:16,818 --> 00:03:18,777
That's because you keep looking at me.

51
00:03:19,577 --> 00:03:20,582
Concentrate.

52
00:03:21,417 --> 00:03:22,382
I...

53
00:03:23,498 --> 00:03:25,817
Remember this. No matter what danger
you face in the future,

54
00:03:25,818 --> 00:03:27,617
this technique can save your life.

55
00:03:27,618 --> 00:03:28,807
Practice it well.

56
00:03:29,338 --> 00:03:30,658
Focus.

57
00:03:34,812 --> 00:03:35,962
Tomorrow,

58
00:03:36,058 --> 00:03:38,220
I'll give you a fine show.

59
00:03:38,938 --> 00:03:40,432
What are you talking about?

60
00:03:40,457 --> 00:03:41,736
Today,

61
00:03:41,737 --> 00:03:43,411
I'll show everyone

62
00:03:43,412 --> 00:03:44,337
what

63
00:03:44,338 --> 00:03:46,082
true dancing is.

64
00:04:00,437 --> 00:04:03,932
(A Celestial Realm of Joy)

65
00:04:31,298 --> 00:04:33,777
Good!

66
00:04:35,938 --> 00:04:37,417
Good!

67
00:04:55,858 --> 00:04:57,857
I've never seen such graceful dance.

68
00:04:57,858 --> 00:04:59,818
There's no trace of vulgarity at all.

69
00:04:59,858 --> 00:05:02,195
She looks like an immortal
from the heavens.

70
00:05:12,087 --> 00:05:13,970
(A Celestial Realm of Joy)

71
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:27,298
Good!

72
00:05:29,137 --> 00:05:31,017
Good!

73
00:05:31,094 --> 00:05:32,895
Good!

74
00:05:34,137 --> 00:05:34,777
Good!

75
00:05:34,818 --> 00:05:35,957
Excellent!

76
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:40,070
My mother taught me

77
00:05:40,978 --> 00:05:42,498
to conduct myself with dignity

78
00:05:42,897 --> 00:05:44,407
and to dance with sincerity.

79
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:46,657
Even as a boat courtesan,

80
00:05:46,738 --> 00:05:48,695
one must live with integrity.

81
00:05:48,818 --> 00:05:50,336
She may be a boat courtesan,

82
00:05:50,337 --> 00:05:53,095
but she lived honestly
through her own skill.

83
00:05:53,298 --> 00:05:54,932
That's better than some people

84
00:05:55,412 --> 00:05:57,092
who are born noble

85
00:05:57,298 --> 00:05:58,776
but act despicably.

86
00:05:58,777 --> 00:05:59,577
You!

87
00:05:59,697 --> 00:06:01,457
Good!

88
00:06:01,897 --> 00:06:03,217
Good!

89
00:06:03,498 --> 00:06:06,337
Good!

90
00:06:10,097 --> 00:06:12,618
Good!

91
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:17,577
Good!

92
00:06:17,897 --> 00:06:23,977
Good!

93
00:06:30,498 --> 00:06:31,417
You wench!

94
00:06:31,418 --> 00:06:32,696
Stop putting on airs.

95
00:06:32,697 --> 00:06:35,011
Since you look down on my dancing,

96
00:06:35,012 --> 00:06:37,216
why not dance yourself?

97
00:06:37,217 --> 00:06:38,537
Who do you think you are

98
00:06:38,777 --> 00:06:40,432
to order me around?

99
00:06:43,217 --> 00:06:44,776
If you think

100
00:06:44,777 --> 00:06:46,470
her skills are lacking,

101
00:06:47,137 --> 00:06:49,058
you must be exceptional yourself.

102
00:06:49,418 --> 00:06:51,220
Why not have a fair contest

103
00:06:51,378 --> 00:06:52,957
in front of everyone here?

104
00:06:55,662 --> 00:06:57,645
This dance costume you're wearing

105
00:06:58,618 --> 00:07:00,332
looks rather familiar.

106
00:07:06,337 --> 00:07:08,241
How brazen of you.

107
00:07:08,241 --> 00:07:10,560
You're actually wearing the phoenix robe
of a crown princess.

108
00:07:10,618 --> 00:07:12,776
Have you gone mad dreaming of
becoming a crown princess?

109
00:07:12,777 --> 00:07:13,656
You wench!

110
00:07:13,657 --> 00:07:15,370
How dare you frame me!

111
00:07:16,837 --> 00:07:18,865
There's no need for me
to say more, right?

112
00:07:27,562 --> 00:07:28,403
Qingru.

113
00:07:28,457 --> 00:07:30,360
There's no need to trouble yourself,
Your Highness.

114
00:07:30,818 --> 00:07:32,298
I'm just a boat courtesan's daughter

115
00:07:32,657 --> 00:07:34,370
who isn't worthy of your concern.

00:07:50,457 --> 00:07:51,799
No one should know about this.

120
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,707
Yes.

121
00:07:56,538 --> 00:07:57,557
Come out.

122
00:08:00,738 --> 00:08:02,298
Where did you lock him up?

123

Even if he's still alive,

124
00:08:07,058 --> 00:08:08,258
what can you do?

125
00:08:12,437 --> 00:08:13,637
You still

126
00:08:14,017 --> 00:08:15,820
can't let him go?

127
00:08:36,618 --> 00:08:37,417
Let go.

128
00:08:37,418 --> 00:08:38,332
Don't move.

129
00:08:41,325 --> 00:08:42,061
You're insane.

130
00:08:42,062 --> 00:08:43,032
Let go.

I heard Young Lady Shen
went to bathe earlier.

145

why don't you take care of him?

She's just a lowly woman!

157
00:10:09,977 --> 00:10:11,757
I said get out.

158
00:10:12,658 --> 00:10:14,482
What am I lacking compared to her?

159
00:10:15,058 --> 00:10:16,817
I'm a Princess.

160
00:10:16,818 --> 00:10:18,532
- She's nothing but a lowly...
- Shut up!

161
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:20,282
You don't deserve to speak of her.

this goes against the rules.

Rules?

This fine mutton-fat jade bracelet

168
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:51,870

didn't you want to see His Highness?

183
00:12:03,577 --> 00:12:06,376
Tonight, I especially
brought him to you.

184
00:12:06,377 --> 00:12:07,670
What did you do to him?

185
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:08,937
Me?

186
00:12:09,697 --> 00:12:11,378
What could I possibly do?

187
00:12:12,977 --> 00:12:14,858
I merely let His Highness taste

188
00:12:15,298 --> 00:12:17,670
the bitterness of love.
