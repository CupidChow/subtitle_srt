1
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,200
Miss, you cannot enter the palace.

2
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:14,000
Make way.

3
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,040
He is His Majesty.

4
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,120
Your biological father.

5
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,200
Qingping.

6
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:31,480
I've come to see you.

7
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:33,680
It's been three years.

8
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,520
Do you remember this jade pendant?

9
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,560
I should have recognized you as a Northern Desert spy long ago.

10
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,870
Qingru, look, isn't this fun?

11
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:25,750
It's fun.

12
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,680
Do you like it?

13
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:27,520
I like it.

14
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:28,910
Then, Mother will buy one for you, okay?

15
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:29,560
Okay.

16
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,000
Shopkeeper, how much for one?

17
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:31,910
Two wen.

18
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:32,470
Alright.

19
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,680
But I still softened my heart.

20
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,400
I let you live in the palace.

21
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,520
I let you take care of Qingru.

22
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,470
Until I discovered...

23
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,800
You wanted to take her back to the Northern Desert.

24
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:02,080
I am the Emperor.

25
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,000
I could not let you take her away.

26
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,870
Even less could I let you tell her of her origins.

27
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,030
Yes.

28
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,360
I was cruel-hearted.

29
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:15,520
But I had no other choice.

30
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,310
I had no choice.

31
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:31,910
Qingru has grown up. That is good.

32
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,190
Very happy.

33
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,120
At least happier than if she knew the truth...

34
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,910
...would make her.

35
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,430
Assassin!

36
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:49,680
Qingping...

37
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,280
Please forgive me.

38
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,150
We are all people with no control over our fate.

39
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:04,520
Why have you hidden it from me until now?

40
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,120
He is your biological father.

41
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,150
He is the Son of Heaven.

42
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,360
What can you possibly do?

43
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:10,470
Killing him would only cost you your life.

44
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:14,310
But I have wrongly blamed Yuwen Que for so many years.

45
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,280
My hatred has wounded him deeply.

46
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,710
I must enter the palace.

47
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,030
Then I will go with you.

48
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:21,960
No.

49
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,430
You stay and take care of him.

50
00:04:26,070 --> 00:04:28,480
His injuries are not yet healed.

51
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:29,680
But you...

52
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,120
This is what I owe him.

53
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:50,600
A-Ru.

54
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,310
She's gone.

55
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,870
What does this mean?

56
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,360
Cangzhou is about to change.

57
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,720
What do you know?

58
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,310
Take your men.

59
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,120
Be ready to provide support.

60
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,270
What is she going to do?

61
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,480
What she intends to do...

62
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,040
...is what you wish to do.

63
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,720
Your Highness, all preparations are complete.

64
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,750
Pass down the order.

65
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:26,870
Guard the city gates strictly.

66
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,160
Without my command...

67
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:30,560
...no one is to act without authorization.

68
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:31,870
This general obeys.

69
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,600
Qingru.

70
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,800
I pray you come to no harm.

71
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,680
Qingping...

72
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,000
Today is the anniversary of your death.

73
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,720
I've come to see you.

74
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,720
All these years, from the bottom of my heart...

75
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,480
Qingping.

76
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:18,390
Your Majesty, do you still remember the blood from that night?

77
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,510
You...

78
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:23,950
You...

79
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,000
You are not...

80
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:28,680
Why did you want to kill me that night?

81
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,190
I... I did it for the empire.

82
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,480
The empire?

83
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:35,630
For the empire, you would sever the bond between us?

84
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,920
No, I...

85
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:38,070
I didn't.

86
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,040
Do you still remember...

87
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,510
...that sword was the one you personally...

88
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:47,630
Your Majesty!

89
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,000
Have you heard?

90
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,600
There's a ghost in the palace tonight.

91
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,190
Isn't it just?

92
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,750
It must be the spirit of the Lady.

93
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,720
You don't know, but there's someone...

94
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,480
...who was scared out of his wits.

95
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,040
Enough talk. Let's hurry and leave.

96
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,680
Mother, I finally know the truth.

97
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,920
This is only the beginning.

98
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,160
Y-Your Highness...

99
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,360
Who wounded you?

100
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,560
Heng Dao.

101
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,160
Lord Heng Dao, he...

102
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,950
...said you were already...

103
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,040
Don't rush.

104
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:41,480
Speak slowly.

105
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,600
He said...

106
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:49,190
...you died in battle against the enemy forces.

107
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,480
He even produced your blood-stained cloak.

108
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,000
And then?

109
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,040
The officers and soldiers all believed it.

110
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,160
He took your command token...

111
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,750
...and took away all the Mobei Iron Cavalry.

112
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,390
Your Highness...

113
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,560
You must be careful.

114
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,870
I saw...

115
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,630
...I saw Lord Heng Dao...

116
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,270
...often meeting late at night...

117
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,680
...meeting with a...

118
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,560
...a...

119
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,600
Rest assured, I will give you justice.

120
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,800
It hasn't even been an hour.

121
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,670
Your Highness, do not fear.

122
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,270
Your subordinate is here.

123
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,240
What fine protection with your life.

124
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,150
You've been following me all along...

125
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,510
...just waiting for this day, haven't you?

126
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,200
My lord, everything has been arranged.

127
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:10,200
Is the army under control?

128
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,790
They all believe the Crown Prince is dead.

129
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,840
With the military command in hand...

130
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:15,390
...they can only obey my orders.

131
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:16,390
Excellent.

132
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,870
Remember, three days from now at midnight...

133
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,270
...open the city gates.

134
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:23,670
However...

135
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:25,960
If the Crown Prince is still alive...

136
00:09:27,630 --> 00:09:28,630
...we must see him alive...

137
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,360
...or see his corpse.

138
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:32,360
Before then...

139
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:36,480
...the Northern Desert army is under your control.

140
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:41,670
Imperial Father.

141
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:43,840
Your child has come to accompany you.

142
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,550
Imperial Father, do you remember...

143
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,790
...that rainy night three years ago?

144
00:10:03,790 --> 00:10:05,270
This was left by my mother.

145
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:08,200
It still bears her bloodstains.

146
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,630
What's wrong? Are you scared?

147
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,870
Back then, my mother was just like this.

148
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:17,790
She fell, covered in blood.

149
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,600
Do you know?

150
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,840
All these years,

151
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,720
I always thought it was Yuwen Que

152
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,150
who killed my mother.

153
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,240
But you...

154
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,360
you are the true murderer.

155
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,030
Before she died, Mother said

156
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,030
the thing she regretted most in her life

157
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:41,360
was believing in your sincerity.

158
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:44,870
Was this empire

159
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:48,270
really worth you killing the one you loved with your own hands?

160
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:59,480
Mother,

161
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,510
your daughter has avenged you.

162
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,790
Su Changji.
