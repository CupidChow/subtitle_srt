=The Ultimate Vow, Unknown to You=

10
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,674
=Episode 24=

11
00:01:09,675 --> 00:01:10,996
From childhood to now,

12
00:01:12,556 --> 00:01:14,876
I've been like someone
without direction,

13
00:01:15,476 --> 00:01:18,236
desperately clinging
to the only familiar shadow.

14
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:21,475
You became everything I chased.

15
00:01:22,275 --> 00:01:23,876
Not because of love,

16
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:25,996
but because

17
00:01:28,075 --> 00:01:30,236
I was too afraid of losing.

18
00:01:35,635 --> 00:01:38,236
I mistook obsession for love,

19
00:01:39,316 --> 00:01:42,395
and dependence for devotion.

20
00:01:43,116 --> 00:01:44,236
Que.

21
00:01:48,476 --> 00:01:49,996
We were both wrong.

22
00:01:52,075 --> 00:01:53,796
I was wrong for not understanding love.

23
00:01:54,635 --> 00:01:55,996
You were wrong because

24
00:01:57,476 --> 00:02:00,115
you never saw my pain for too long.

25
00:02:01,075 --> 00:02:03,516
I've done too many things
that hurt you both.

26
00:02:06,316 --> 00:02:07,436
Young Lady Shen,

27
00:02:08,515 --> 00:02:10,115
I don't ask for your forgiveness.

28
00:02:10,316 --> 00:02:13,315
All the harm I once inflicted on you,

29
00:02:15,196 --> 00:02:17,115
you may take it back.

30
00:02:18,355 --> 00:02:19,476
It's just

31
00:02:20,795 --> 00:02:22,796
I don't want to die yet.

32
00:02:25,555 --> 00:02:28,796
There are too many things
in this world I don't understand,

33
00:02:30,276 --> 00:02:32,796
too many truths I can't yet grasp.

34
00:02:34,675 --> 00:02:39,636
I need time to find a path
that belongs to me.

35
00:02:41,876 --> 00:02:43,236
Not for anyone else,

36
00:02:47,115 --> 00:02:48,995
only to find

37
00:02:51,716 --> 00:02:53,076
my true self.

38
00:02:53,476 --> 00:02:54,596
Wen Ling,

39
00:02:55,395 --> 00:02:56,995
I don't wish to repay hatred
with virtue,

40
00:02:57,596 --> 00:03:00,115
but I won't spill more blood either.

41
00:03:01,716 --> 00:03:03,036
Perhaps we should

42
00:03:03,996 --> 00:03:05,196
end it here.

43
00:03:06,476 --> 00:03:07,636
Qingru.

44
00:03:13,876 --> 00:03:14,995
Let's go.

45
00:03:18,716 --> 00:03:22,675
This time, I'll walk on alone.

46
00:03:40,476 --> 00:03:42,114
My lords, bad news!

47
00:03:42,115 --> 00:03:43,915
His Majesty has gone missing again!

48
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:45,595
After breakfast this morning,

49
00:03:45,596 --> 00:03:47,275
he vanished once more.

50
00:03:47,276 --> 00:03:49,155
He must have eloped again
with Young Lady Shen.

51
00:03:49,156 --> 00:03:50,315
In my opinion,

52
00:03:50,316 --> 00:03:52,475
Young Lady Shen is stunningly beautiful.

53
00:03:52,476 --> 00:03:55,114
It's only natural His Majesty
is infatuated.

54
00:03:55,115 --> 00:03:56,715
Though His Majesty often
leaves the palace,

55
00:03:56,716 --> 00:03:58,915
state affairs remain well managed.

56
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:00,875
There's no need for concern.

57
00:04:01,196 --> 00:04:02,395
Indeed.

58
00:04:15,395 --> 00:04:16,514
This little one

59
00:04:16,515 --> 00:04:17,875
has been moving a lot lately.

60
00:04:18,196 --> 00:04:19,835
Must be a lively child.

61
00:04:20,355 --> 00:04:22,915
Do you think he resembles you more,

62
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:24,396
or me?

63
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:26,796
I hope the baby will be like you.

64
00:04:27,675 --> 00:04:29,596
That lively spirit of yours

65
00:04:30,276 --> 00:04:31,554
it's what I love most.

66
00:04:31,555 --> 00:04:33,515
There you go again,
acting like an Emperor.

67
00:04:33,516 --> 00:04:34,716
Here,

68
00:04:34,836 --> 00:04:36,396
you're just my husband,

69
00:04:36,675 --> 00:04:38,315
not some supreme ruler.

70
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:39,995
Only you

71
00:04:40,836 --> 00:04:42,476
would dare speak to me like this.

72
00:04:45,396 --> 00:04:46,435
In this world,

73
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:51,236
you are the one I cherish most.

74
00:05:10,276 --> 00:05:11,275
Sir,

75
00:05:11,276 --> 00:05:12,475
since you've eaten well,

76
00:05:12,476 --> 00:05:13,596
it's time to pay.

77
00:05:19,195 --> 00:05:20,236
Well.

78
00:05:20,755 --> 00:05:22,915
I don't have any silver
on me at the moment.

79
00:05:22,916 --> 00:05:24,475
You poor, miserable wretch.

80
00:05:24,476 --> 00:05:26,114
How dare you eat without paying!

81
00:05:26,115 --> 00:05:27,435
Outrageous!

82
00:05:30,076 --> 00:05:31,755
Do you know who I am?

83
00:05:32,675 --> 00:05:34,635
I am the Emperor of Mobei.

84
00:05:34,636 --> 00:05:36,236
Kneel at once!

85
00:05:36,995 --> 00:05:38,156
Tch!

86
00:05:38,315 --> 00:05:40,515
You're just an ignorant madman.

87
00:05:40,516 --> 00:05:43,314
If you were truly the Emperor,
why would you be eating at my shop?

88
00:05:43,315 --> 00:05:44,796
Get out of here!

89
00:05:44,956 --> 00:05:46,155
If you're the Mobei Emperor,

90
00:05:46,156 --> 00:05:47,515
then I must be the Retired Emperor!

91
00:05:47,516 --> 00:05:48,275
What a lunatic!

92
00:05:48,276 --> 00:05:49,276
Get lost!

93
00:05:49,396 --> 00:05:50,875
Out!

94
00:05:52,115 --> 00:05:52,915
Everyone, look.

95
00:05:52,916 --> 00:05:54,236
This man's insane!

96
00:05:54,675 --> 00:05:55,675
Insolence!

97
00:05:56,156 --> 00:05:57,395
I'll kill you!

98
00:05:57,396 --> 00:05:59,554
All of you deserve to die!

99
00:05:59,555 --> 00:06:01,276
I'll kill every one of you!

100
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:04,275
You all deserve death! I'll kill you all!

101
00:06:04,276 --> 00:06:05,496
Here's the money for the drinks.

102
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:07,796
Young master, let's go home.

103
00:06:09,675 --> 00:06:10,836
Go home.

104
00:06:13,037 --> 00:06:14,475
Where is home?

105
00:06:14,476 --> 00:06:16,720
Home is wherever I am.

106
00:06:17,755 --> 00:06:18,875
Come.

107
00:06:23,596 --> 00:06:25,195
I really am the Emperor.

108
00:06:26,115 --> 00:06:28,555
I am the Emperor of Mobei.

109
00:06:30,115 --> 00:06:32,596
Yes, young master,
whatever you say is right.

110
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:34,095
Let's go home.

111
00:06:35,516 --> 00:06:36,995
This is my world.

112
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:40,195
My world.

113
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:44,356
All should die.

114
00:06:44,675 --> 00:06:45,956
All should die.

115
00:06:48,836 --> 00:06:50,476
It is my world.

116
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:53,956
All of you deserve death.

117
00:06:57,276 --> 00:07:01,276
Did Cui Di develop feelings
for Su Changji?

118
00:07:02,916 --> 00:07:06,315
She said she once owed him a favor.

119
00:07:07,115 --> 00:07:08,836
And she needs a lifetime to repay it.

120
00:07:18,476 --> 00:07:21,515
If we could always live here,
how wonderful it would be.

121
00:07:21,555 --> 00:07:23,236
This place is far
from the worldly clamor.

122
00:07:23,396 --> 00:07:25,075
It truly is paradise on earth.

123
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:27,515
After our child is born,

124
00:07:27,516 --> 00:07:29,596
we will build a small courtyard here.

125
00:07:29,995 --> 00:07:31,675
The peaceful life you desire,

126
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:33,194
I will give you all of it.

127
00:07:33,195 --> 00:07:35,836
Really? You promise?

128
00:07:37,956 --> 00:07:39,195
Of course.

129
00:07:39,716 --> 00:07:41,796
Ru, whatever you desire

130
00:07:42,115 --> 00:07:43,716
in this world,

131
00:07:44,355 --> 00:07:45,635
I will give it to you.

132
00:07:56,315 --> 00:08:00,115
The life of ordinary people is far more
interesting than in the palace.

133
00:08:00,675 --> 00:08:03,315
Look, over there,
making sugar figurines.

134
00:08:03,675 --> 00:08:05,236
And over there, doing magic tricks.

135
00:08:07,476 --> 00:08:08,114
This rattle...

136
00:08:08,115 --> 00:08:09,995
Slowly and carefully.

137
00:08:10,076 --> 00:08:11,596
This rattle

138
00:08:11,995 --> 00:08:13,515
is exquisitely crafted.

139
00:08:15,596 --> 00:08:16,836
Crisp in sound,

140
00:08:16,995 --> 00:08:18,596
perfect for children to play with.

141
00:08:19,076 --> 00:08:20,195
Great.

142
00:08:21,115 --> 00:08:24,475
Then let's pick the best one
for our future child.

143
00:08:24,476 --> 00:08:26,114
Sir, you have great taste.

144
00:08:26,115 --> 00:08:27,275
This rattle

145
00:08:27,276 --> 00:08:29,194
made from premium phoenix wood.

146
00:08:29,195 --> 00:08:30,275
Clear, pleasant sound,

147
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:31,596
durable and long-lasting.

148
00:08:32,156 --> 00:08:33,916
Five coins each.

149
00:08:35,355 --> 00:08:37,036
Indeed, it sounds lovely.

150
00:08:37,955 --> 00:08:38,674
Boss,

151
00:08:38,675 --> 00:08:41,594
I'll take all these rattles.

152
00:08:41,595 --> 00:08:43,155
That's not allowed.

153
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:44,915
One silver ingot is too much.

154
00:08:46,555 --> 00:08:48,076
Alright, thank you.

155
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:50,755
Look at this young master,

156
00:08:50,756 --> 00:08:52,275
how much he cherishes his lady.

157
00:08:52,315 --> 00:08:54,676
Even buying a simple rattle,
he is so generous.

158
00:08:54,756 --> 00:08:56,115
The lady is with child,

159
00:08:56,116 --> 00:08:57,915
the husband treasures her even more.

160
00:08:58,116 --> 00:09:00,915
This is truly a couple blessed
by the gods.

161
00:09:04,116 --> 00:09:05,795
You, being the dignified Emperor,

162
00:09:06,075 --> 00:09:08,836
yet indulges in such love affairs,

163
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:12,716
like an ordinary man.

164
00:09:15,116 --> 00:09:16,395
In front of you,

165
00:09:17,276 --> 00:09:19,596
I'm just an ordinary man.

166
00:09:20,315 --> 00:09:21,995
Who needs the throne or crown?

167
00:09:24,715 --> 00:09:26,316
Look at these children,

168
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:29,995
this is what a prosperous era
looks like.

169
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:35,196
I've never seen you

170
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:37,436
so happy in the palace.

171
00:09:37,876 --> 00:09:39,436
Of course, it's different here.

172
00:09:39,675 --> 00:09:41,596
The palace isn't as fun as outside.

173
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:44,676
So naturally, I'm different.

174
00:09:46,315 --> 00:09:48,635
I hope our child won't be unpredictable

175
00:09:48,835 --> 00:09:50,236
like you.

179
00:10:19,396 --> 00:10:21,115
I remember when we first met,

180
00:10:21,116 --> 00:10:22,676
it was also at dusk like this.

181
00:10:22,996 --> 00:10:24,235
Back then,

182
00:10:24,236 --> 00:10:26,236
you weren't yet the mighty Emperor.

183
00:10:30,996 --> 00:10:33,196
Whether in commoner's clothes
or as Emperor,

184
00:10:34,715 --> 00:10:36,915
I've always been Che who loves you.

185
00:10:38,595 --> 00:10:40,275
Sometimes I think,

186
00:10:40,715 --> 00:10:43,236
if I could do it all over,

187
00:10:43,675 --> 00:10:46,474
I'd still choose to be with you.

188
00:10:46,475 --> 00:10:48,115
To meet you and know you,

189
00:10:49,116 --> 00:10:52,795
is the greatest gift heaven
has given me.

190
00:10:53,955 --> 00:10:58,395
I used to think imperial power
and wealth were trivial.

191
00:10:58,675 --> 00:11:00,076
Now I see,

192
00:11:00,595 --> 00:11:03,395
peace in the world is the most precious.

193
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:04,795
With you by my side,

194
00:11:07,156 --> 00:11:11,436
world peace is my greatest wish.

195
00:11:13,962 --> 00:11:17,932
♪Today, I pluck romance and moonlight♪

196
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,682
♪And weave them all into a painting♪
