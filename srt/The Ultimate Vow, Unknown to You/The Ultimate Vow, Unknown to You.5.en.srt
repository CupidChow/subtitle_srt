11
00:01:09,687 --> 00:01:13,127
I will uncover the truth
and avenge you with my own hands.

12
00:01:14,247 --> 00:01:15,127
Kill!

13
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,528
Find the right moment,

14
00:01:39,568 --> 00:01:40,487
then leave first.

15
00:01:49,787 --> 00:01:50,609
Careful.

16
00:01:52,275 --> 00:01:53,404
Yuwen Que.

17
00:02:00,007 --> 00:02:00,888
Let her go.

18
00:02:01,462 --> 00:02:03,249
General, you carry quite the air.

19
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:05,006
Do you want the military seal,
or your life?

20
00:02:05,007 --> 00:02:06,760
General, you would do well
to think carefully.

21
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:07,232
You...

22
00:02:07,375 --> 00:02:08,474
General, you must not.

23
00:02:09,647 --> 00:02:11,407
If you dare harm her in the slightest,

24
00:02:11,568 --> 00:02:13,528
I will make sure
you suffer a fate worse than death.

25
00:02:13,568 --> 00:02:15,207
That depends on the General's choice.

26
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:16,727
I will give you three days.

27
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,327
(Joy)

28
00:02:37,328 --> 00:02:39,928
So it was Your Highness
who laid this perfect trap.

29
00:02:43,087 --> 00:02:44,488
You should have known long ago,

30
00:02:46,127 --> 00:02:47,768
I would never allow you to marry him.

31
00:02:47,928 --> 00:02:49,887
A prince of Mobei,

32
00:02:50,527 --> 00:02:52,608
reduced to the ways of bandits,

33
00:02:53,208 --> 00:02:55,328
seizing another man's wife by force.

34
00:02:56,127 --> 00:02:57,928
Your Highness shows
such disregard for decorum.

35
00:02:58,567 --> 00:03:00,528
The face of the Mobei royal family

36
00:03:00,768 --> 00:03:03,847
has been utterly ruined by you.

37
00:03:07,087 --> 00:03:08,167
Do you think

38
00:03:10,087 --> 00:03:11,567
I care about any of that?

39
00:03:12,407 --> 00:03:13,447
You are insane.

40
00:03:13,888 --> 00:03:14,928
Yes.

41
00:03:15,728 --> 00:03:16,928
I am insane.

42
00:03:17,768 --> 00:03:19,447
Watching you marry another,

43
00:03:20,407 --> 00:03:22,048
how could I not go mad?

44
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:24,328
You lost the right
to say such things long ago.

45
00:03:25,087 --> 00:03:26,887
The moment you raised your blade
and struck,

46
00:03:27,328 --> 00:03:29,208
you should have known
this day would come.

47
00:03:39,687 --> 00:03:41,208
Hate me if you wish.

48
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,998
Kill me if you must.

49
00:03:43,168 --> 00:03:44,328
I accept it.

50
00:03:45,168 --> 00:03:46,395
But this time,

51
00:03:48,928 --> 00:03:51,048
I will never let you escape.

52
00:03:54,928 --> 00:03:57,328
Do you know how disgusting

53
00:03:57,407 --> 00:03:58,586
you look right now?

54
00:03:58,587 --> 00:04:03,407
♪In the end, it becomes an epitaph♪

55
00:04:06,048 --> 00:04:08,127
You and I crossed that line long ago.

56
00:04:09,087 --> 00:04:11,248
We should have stood together
before the altar.

57
00:04:13,112 --> 00:04:14,967
It was Su Changji

58
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,215
who tore you away from me!

59
00:04:19,087 --> 00:04:22,368
Whatever bound us ended long ago.

60
00:04:28,887 --> 00:04:30,007
Let go of me.

61
00:04:33,968 --> 00:04:35,007
Do you really think

62
00:04:35,327 --> 00:04:37,368
this bit of pain
will make me release you?

63
00:04:50,968 --> 00:04:52,007
Go on, bite.

64
00:04:52,447 --> 00:04:54,408
That is the Ru I remember.

65
00:04:56,168 --> 00:04:56,968
Your Highness.

66
00:04:57,448 --> 00:04:59,288
His Majesty summons you
to the Imperial Study.

67
00:05:06,247 --> 00:05:07,527
Wait for me.

68
00:05:08,247 --> 00:05:09,887
We will finish this when I return.

69
00:05:17,127 --> 00:05:18,168
Yuwen Que.

70
00:05:18,437 --> 00:05:19,994
You will die without mercy.

71
00:05:23,637 --> 00:05:25,327
Then we go to hell together.

72
00:05:29,807 --> 00:05:30,848
Watch her carefully.

73
00:05:31,437 --> 00:05:32,447
Do not let her

74
00:05:32,767 --> 00:05:33,808
hurt herself.

75
00:05:34,062 --> 00:05:34,920
Yes.

76
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,887
I swear,

77
00:05:40,207 --> 00:05:42,446
you will pay

78
00:05:42,447 --> 00:05:44,127
for everything you did today.

79
00:05:44,447 --> 00:05:45,566
Your Majesty.

80
00:05:45,567 --> 00:05:47,727
This is a treasured relic
from Mobei Changlong.

81
00:05:47,728 --> 00:05:49,800
It is said that whoever possesses
this tortoise shell

82
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,800
will be blessed
with great fortune over the realm.

83
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,570
Very well.

84
00:05:53,968 --> 00:05:56,366
It is indeed a rare piece.

85
00:05:56,367 --> 00:05:59,127
Wen Ling, you have put
real thought into this.

86
00:06:02,567 --> 00:06:04,408
Your Majesty, I pay my respects.

87
00:06:04,767 --> 00:06:07,447
Your behavior last night
in my Imperial Garden was reckless.

88
00:06:07,687 --> 00:06:09,345
Do not think it escaped me.

89
00:06:09,567 --> 00:06:10,687
I accept my fault.

90
00:06:10,807 --> 00:06:11,808
Que.

91
00:06:11,812 --> 00:06:13,126
Wen Ling

92
00:06:13,127 --> 00:06:15,246
gentle in nature, and proper in conduct.

93
00:06:15,247 --> 00:06:17,527
I have already granted your marriage.

94
00:06:17,567 --> 00:06:18,488
Father.

95
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:19,395
What is it?

96
00:06:19,648 --> 00:06:21,766
Do you still dare to object?

97
00:06:21,767 --> 00:06:23,246
I beg Father to revoke the decree.

98
00:06:23,247 --> 00:06:25,047
I would rather die than comply.

99
00:06:25,048 --> 00:06:25,686
Your Highness.

100
00:06:25,687 --> 00:06:26,928
I have already given my heart.

101
00:06:27,007 --> 00:06:28,087
I will never betray her.

102
00:06:28,088 --> 00:06:29,087
Insolent!

103
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,446
Do you know how many merits
Wen Ling's father

104
00:06:31,447 --> 00:06:33,968
has rendered to the court?

105
00:06:34,162 --> 00:06:36,778
From now on, Que
will be under your discipline.

106
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:38,020
I admit my guilt.

107
00:06:38,168 --> 00:06:40,057
But this matter cannot be.

108
00:06:40,327 --> 00:06:41,124
You!

109
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:42,604
I beg Father's forgiveness.

110
00:06:59,767 --> 00:07:00,561
Your Highness.

111
00:07:00,562 --> 00:07:01,674
Please return.

112
00:07:05,447 --> 00:07:07,127
I have waited for you all these years.

113
00:07:08,608 --> 00:07:10,127
Do you truly not know how I feel?

114
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:14,367
I am sorry.

115
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,920
In this world,

116
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:19,567
there is room in my heart
for only one person.

117
00:07:58,127 --> 00:08:00,887
Your Highness, Young Lady Shen
asked me for joss paper.

118
00:08:00,968 --> 00:08:02,127
She said today

119
00:08:02,807 --> 00:08:04,567
marks the death anniversary
of her closest kin.

120
00:08:09,807 --> 00:08:11,048
Mother.

121
00:08:13,528 --> 00:08:14,928
Before you passed,

122
00:08:16,887 --> 00:08:18,968
you said all men in this world
are fickle.

123
00:08:21,887 --> 00:08:23,327
Yet I refused to believe it.

124
00:08:26,807 --> 00:08:28,048
Now it seems,

125
00:08:29,648 --> 00:08:31,207
how bitterly ironic.

126
00:08:35,447 --> 00:08:37,808
He swore to protect me for a lifetime,

127
00:08:39,648 --> 00:08:41,887
to grow old with me, side by side.

128
00:08:44,408 --> 00:08:45,848
Yet in the end,

129
00:08:47,325 --> 00:08:49,568
I merely invited a wolf into my home,

130
00:08:52,767 --> 00:08:54,760
and with his own hands,
he destroyed my entire family.

131
00:09:04,128 --> 00:09:05,167
That night,

132
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:10,407
I saw you collapse in a pool of blood.

133
00:09:10,528 --> 00:09:11,488
Mother.

134
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:14,248
Mother.

135
00:09:15,048 --> 00:09:15,968
Mother.

136
00:09:17,288 --> 00:09:19,007
Qingru.

137
00:09:19,487 --> 00:09:21,007
Remember this.

138
00:09:21,168 --> 00:09:23,767
No matter what happens,

139
00:09:23,928 --> 00:09:26,726
you must live on, and live well.

140
00:09:26,727 --> 00:09:28,248
No.

141
00:09:28,288 --> 00:09:30,167
This jade pendant

142
00:09:31,528 --> 00:09:33,608
will keep you safe.

143
00:09:34,528 --> 00:09:37,086
Mother.

144
00:09:37,087 --> 00:09:38,848
I am utterly useless.

145
00:09:39,048 --> 00:09:41,248
I let you die such a cruel death.

146
00:09:43,727 --> 00:09:45,368
My greatest fault

147
00:09:46,967 --> 00:09:49,287
was believing a heartless man.

148
00:09:51,087 --> 00:09:53,208
I destroyed an entire family.

149
00:09:57,048 --> 00:09:57,968
Heng Dao.

150
00:09:59,648 --> 00:10:00,647
Go investigate for me

151
00:10:00,687 --> 00:10:02,328
who killed Ru's family.

152
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:03,712
Yes.

153
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,287

179

A prisoner.

184
00:11:54,487 --> 00:11:56,345
