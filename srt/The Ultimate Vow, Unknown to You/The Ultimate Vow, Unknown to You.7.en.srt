10

=Episode 7=

11
00:01:13,425 --> 00:01:17,307
(Chengguang Hall, three days later)

12
00:01:18,587 --> 00:01:19,267
Your Highness.

13
00:01:20,788 --> 00:01:22,460
Your injuries are no longer serious,
are they?

14
00:01:22,747 --> 00:01:23,627
Where is Ru?

15
00:01:23,628 --> 00:01:25,588
I have led men to search
the entire palace.

16
00:01:25,747 --> 00:01:27,347
We found no trace of Young Lady Shen.

17
00:01:27,348 --> 00:01:28,507
Go find her.

18
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:29,588
Yes.

19
00:01:36,667 --> 00:01:39,067
The most dangerous place
is the safest place.

20
00:01:39,068 --> 00:01:40,828
He actually didn't die.

21
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:42,228
Your Highness.

22
00:01:46,747 --> 00:01:47,868
Your Highness.

23
00:01:49,187 --> 00:01:49,867
Search thoroughly.

24
00:01:49,868 --> 00:01:50,707
Yes.

25
00:01:52,788 --> 00:01:53,707
Who's there?

26
00:02:06,027 --> 00:02:07,267
Don't be afraid. It's me.

27
00:02:10,107 --> 00:02:11,147
General.

28
00:02:14,907 --> 00:02:16,028
I'll take you away.

29
00:02:22,747 --> 00:02:23,707
This is...

30
00:02:25,347 --> 00:02:26,827
Su Changji's jade pendant.

31
00:02:28,108 --> 00:02:29,268
Go to the General's Residence.

32
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:31,682
(General's Residence)

33
00:02:36,828 --> 00:02:38,506
Your Highness, what are you doing?

34
00:02:38,507 --> 00:02:39,267
Search it.

35
00:02:39,268 --> 00:02:40,067
Yes.

36
00:02:43,268 --> 00:02:45,960
Your Highness suddenly
brings troops into my residence.

37
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,066
What is the meaning of this?

38
00:02:47,067 --> 00:02:48,506
Young Lady Shen has gone missing.

39
00:02:48,507 --> 00:02:50,428
I heard General Su is hiding her.

40
00:02:51,868 --> 00:02:53,627
There is no Young Lady Shen
in this residence,

41
00:02:54,187 --> 00:02:55,708
only the General's wife.

42
00:02:56,868 --> 00:02:58,107
Su Changji.

43
00:02:58,108 --> 00:02:59,947
Don't force me to be unpleasant.

44
00:03:01,787 --> 00:03:04,295
Your Highness, do not go too far.

45
00:03:47,507 --> 00:03:48,428
Stop!

46
00:03:50,388 --> 00:03:51,347
Ru.

47
00:03:51,707 --> 00:03:53,028
Come back to the palace with me.

48
00:03:53,507 --> 00:03:55,028
Unless I die.

49
00:04:27,827 --> 00:04:29,348
Ru.

50
00:04:30,468 --> 00:04:32,188
Come back with me.

51
00:04:37,627 --> 00:04:38,587
The night before last,

52
00:04:38,588 --> 00:04:40,386
the Crown Prince took
the General's wife away.

53
00:04:40,387 --> 00:04:41,146
Is it true?

54
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:42,387
Keep your voice down.

55
00:04:43,947 --> 00:04:46,227
I heard the General hasn't
shown himself for three days.

56
00:04:46,228 --> 00:04:48,548
Don't discuss such matters.

57
00:04:56,348 --> 00:04:57,548
Your Ladyship.

58
00:05:00,827 --> 00:05:03,746
I hear Shen in the prison
has been eating quite well.

59
00:05:03,747 --> 00:05:07,188
Your Ladyship,
everything is done by the rules.

60
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:08,507
The rules?

61
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:16,188
This is what she should be eating.

62
00:05:25,627 --> 00:05:27,507
I'm afraid that's improper.

63
00:05:30,627 --> 00:05:31,908
What's improper about it?

64
00:05:32,028 --> 00:05:33,946
His Highness hasn't come
to see her for three days.

65
00:05:33,947 --> 00:05:36,908
It was probably just a passing fancy.

66
00:05:37,187 --> 00:05:38,587
Does person like her

67
00:05:38,627 --> 00:05:40,748
deserve fine meals?

68
00:05:43,187 --> 00:05:45,947
But if His Highness were to find out...

69
00:05:47,028 --> 00:05:49,548
If you can make her suffer enough,

70
00:05:51,228 --> 00:05:52,868
this will only be the beginning.

71
00:05:53,747 --> 00:05:54,668
Remember,

72
00:05:55,108 --> 00:05:56,428
leave no evidence.

73
00:05:56,668 --> 00:05:59,668
Do it well, and there will
be greater rewards later.

74
00:06:03,187 --> 00:06:04,428
Rest assured, Your Ladyship.

75
00:06:04,548 --> 00:06:05,868
I understand.

76
00:06:20,028 --> 00:06:22,267
Madam, it's time to eat.

77
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,947
Did you bring your own rations?

78
00:06:38,228 --> 00:06:41,188
You're noble and precious.

79
00:06:41,348 --> 00:06:43,706
I fear this coarse fare

80
00:06:43,707 --> 00:06:45,108
is beneath you.

81
00:06:45,267 --> 00:06:46,427
However,

82
00:06:46,428 --> 00:06:50,306
His Highness hasn't come
to see you for three days.

83
00:06:50,307 --> 00:06:51,306
Presumably

84
00:06:51,307 --> 00:06:53,147
he doesn't care what you eat.

85
00:06:56,147 --> 00:06:57,548
In that case,

86
00:06:58,707 --> 00:07:00,788
why not let you taste it first?

87
00:07:11,668 --> 00:07:12,788
How dare you!

88
00:07:12,908 --> 00:07:14,147
Do you want to die?

89
00:07:14,428 --> 00:07:15,228
You...

90
00:07:15,387 --> 00:07:16,507
How dare you?

91
00:07:17,307 --> 00:07:18,467
Why wouldn't I dare?

92
00:07:19,868 --> 00:07:21,706
The money your mistress paid you

93
00:07:21,707 --> 00:07:23,908
won't even cover your burial.

94
00:07:23,988 --> 00:07:24,795
You...

95
00:07:25,228 --> 00:07:26,507
What do you want?

96
00:07:26,707 --> 00:07:27,507
Go.

97
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:29,308
Prepare hot water for a bath,

98
00:07:29,668 --> 00:07:31,428
and a clean set of clothes.

99
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:32,548
This...

100
00:07:32,908 --> 00:07:33,827
What?

101
00:07:33,988 --> 00:07:35,627
Do you want me to decide for you?

102
00:07:36,228 --> 00:07:37,427
Yes.

103
00:07:37,428 --> 00:07:38,832
I'll do it right away.

104
00:07:54,988 --> 00:07:56,228
What's with all the panic?

105
00:07:56,588 --> 00:07:57,428
Your Ladyship.

106
00:07:57,988 --> 00:07:59,428
Shen Qingru

107
00:08:00,348 --> 00:08:01,987
is not easy to deal with.

108
00:08:01,988 --> 00:08:03,668
Go help in the kitchen.

109
00:08:03,707 --> 00:08:05,147
She'll be handled here.

110
00:08:09,707 --> 00:08:11,188
Prepare the bath items.

111
00:08:11,548 --> 00:08:12,467
Remember,

112
00:08:12,668 --> 00:08:14,108
the water must be cold enough.

113
00:08:14,187 --> 00:08:14,988
Yes.

114
00:08:27,387 --> 00:08:29,108
How's the water temperature?

115
00:08:31,187 --> 00:08:32,108
Your Ladyship.

116
00:08:32,267 --> 00:08:34,668
If we're going to play,
let's play something new.

117
00:08:35,548 --> 00:08:36,827
Young Lady Shen,

118
00:08:37,387 --> 00:08:38,947
are you satisfied

119
00:08:39,188 --> 00:08:40,388
with this bath water?

120
00:08:43,427 --> 00:08:44,508
Your Ladyship!

121
00:08:45,988 --> 00:08:47,587
Why don't you try it yourself?

122
00:08:47,588 --> 00:08:48,508
Let go of me!

123
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:02,987
Tie her up!

124
00:09:31,627 --> 00:09:34,508
Young Lady Shen,
with the body of a courtesan,

125
00:09:35,108 --> 00:09:37,947
yet you put on airs
as if delicate and noble,

126
00:09:38,147 --> 00:09:39,587
too soft to suffer.

127
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:41,987
Since that's the case,

128
00:09:42,068 --> 00:09:44,188
I have specially prepared for you

129
00:09:44,988 --> 00:09:46,428
a lively little spectacle.

130
00:09:55,547 --> 00:09:56,867
Stop pretending to be so virtuous.

131
00:09:57,188 --> 00:09:59,548
You're nothing but a shameless,
lowly maid.

132
00:10:00,147 --> 00:10:01,827
Seducing His Highness wasn't enough,

133
00:10:02,308 --> 00:10:04,107
you even went after General Su.

134
00:10:05,948 --> 00:10:07,707
Since you're so good at enticing men,

135
00:10:09,027 --> 00:10:09,908
tonight,

136
00:10:10,188 --> 00:10:11,707
I'll grant your wish.

137
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:14,827
Guards!

138
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:23,587
I'd like to see

139
00:10:24,988 --> 00:10:27,668
how many men's hearts you can ensnare.

140
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:36,908
Come in.

141
00:10:54,627 --> 00:10:55,827
Wen Ling.

142
00:10:55,828 --> 00:10:58,268
You will pay for what you've done today.

143
00:10:59,547 --> 00:11:01,467
Then I'll wait and see.

144
00:11:04,427 --> 00:11:06,827
Enjoy your night of pleasure.

145
00:11:07,948 --> 00:11:09,587
Thank you for the reward, Your Ladyship.

146
00:11:13,348 --> 00:11:14,587
Little beauty.

147
00:11:15,027 --> 00:11:17,307
Let's have some fun tonight.

148
00:11:17,308 --> 00:11:18,268
Don't come any closer!

149
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:19,508
Don't come any closer!
