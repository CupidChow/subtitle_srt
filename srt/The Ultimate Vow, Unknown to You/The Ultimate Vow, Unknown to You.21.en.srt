=The Ultimate Vow, Unknown to You=

10
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,780
=Episode 21=

11
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:39,249
Please. I beg you.

12
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:41,769
Please save him.

13
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,889
I'm begging you.

14
00:01:45,009 --> 00:01:46,969
Please save him.

15
00:01:59,569 --> 00:02:01,049
She loved him so much.

16
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:04,129
She knelt for three days
and three nights to beg for medicine.

17
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:06,850
But in the end, he killed her.

18
00:02:07,449 --> 00:02:08,568
Yes.

19
00:02:08,569 --> 00:02:11,249
If you knew the one you love
would betray you someday,

20
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,609
even kill you,

21
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:14,290
would you still save him?

22
00:02:14,729 --> 00:02:15,970
I would.

23
00:02:16,289 --> 00:02:17,290
Why?

24
00:02:26,769 --> 00:02:28,849
Because the sincerity
of this very moment

25
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:30,529
is worth trading a life for.

26
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:32,369
Was it worth it?

27
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:33,929
When you truly love someone,

28
00:02:34,729 --> 00:02:36,290
you don't ask whether it's worth it.

29
00:02:36,449 --> 00:02:38,369
Congratulations on passing
the second trial.

30
00:02:38,769 --> 00:02:41,850
But the third trial is the hardest.

31
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:44,970
Because it requires you
to let go of your obsession.

32
00:02:45,169 --> 00:02:46,450
Are you willing?

33
00:02:47,169 --> 00:02:48,250
Lead the way.

34
00:02:55,075 --> 00:02:57,724
(Medicine)

35
00:02:57,725 --> 00:03:00,757
(Chrysanthemum)

36
00:03:02,769 --> 00:03:04,929
This is my third trial.

37
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,290
This medicine can cure all poisons,

38
00:03:09,049 --> 00:03:11,530
but it requires a life in exchange.

39
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:14,728
Do you know why I have lived 90 years

40
00:03:14,729 --> 00:03:16,369
yet still look like a child?

41
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:18,768
Because you mastered
the art of preserving youth.

42
00:03:18,769 --> 00:03:19,889
No.

43
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:22,048
It's because I severed love and desire.

44
00:03:22,049 --> 00:03:24,570
Love ages a person the fastest.

45
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:27,450
Saving him will shorten your lifespan.

46
00:03:27,729 --> 00:03:28,929
Are you willing?

47
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:38,410
Qingru.

48
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:39,850
Qingru.

49
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:42,369
To save your life,

50
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:43,728
she paid with her own.

51
00:03:43,729 --> 00:03:45,010
She's already gone.

52
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:47,450
If anything happens to her,

53
00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:49,450
I will never forgive you.

54
00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:50,450
Stop!

55
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,609
Since you and I have met,

56
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:07,530
it is a pact of a hundred years.

57
00:04:08,169 --> 00:04:09,369
Alive, we walk together.

58
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:10,730
Dead, we return together.

59
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:12,329
If you betray me,

60
00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:14,690
even in the netherworld,

61
00:04:15,009 --> 00:04:16,690
I will seek you out for reckoning.

62
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:23,090

90
00:05:43,369 --> 00:05:44,649
Tell me,

91
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:47,489
why did you return to Mobei back then?

92
00:05:51,049 --> 00:05:55,090
At the time, my father ordered me
to marry Princess Wen Ling.

93
00:05:55,129 --> 00:05:57,009
I would rather give up my status
as a prince,

94
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:58,410
only to ask Father's permission.

95
00:05:58,530 --> 00:05:59,569
Preposterous!

96
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,529
For a common woman,

97
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:04,170
you would abandon your royal identity?

98
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:07,128
Yes. To me, Ru

99
00:06:07,129 --> 00:06:09,170
is far more important than royal status.

100
00:06:09,249 --> 00:06:10,369
Guards!

101
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:13,369
Escort the Crown Prince
to Chengguang Hall.

102
00:06:13,489 --> 00:06:14,849
Without my decree,

103
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:16,689
he is not to take a single step outside.

104
00:06:16,929 --> 00:06:18,049
So

105
00:06:19,049 --> 00:06:20,730
you were imprisoned.

106
00:06:21,609 --> 00:06:22,449
Yes.

107
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:25,290
My father ordered me
to marry Princess Wen Ling.

108
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:28,650
To escape the marriage,
I went to the battlefield.

109
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:30,730
When I finally escaped,

110
00:06:31,169 --> 00:06:34,330
I heard about what happened
to your mother.

111
00:06:35,369 --> 00:06:37,049
And you were nowhere to be found.

112
00:06:37,609 --> 00:06:39,530
Then why didn't you tell me?

113
00:06:39,809 --> 00:06:42,689
I didn't want our identities
to stand in our way.

114
00:06:42,809 --> 00:06:45,329
I thought as long as I gave up
my status as a prince,

115
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:47,449
we could live in peace together.

116
00:06:47,609 --> 00:06:51,449
In fact, those rumors were deliberately
spread by His Majesty.

117
00:06:53,729 --> 00:06:54,970
What did you say?

118
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:58,129
His Majesty didn't want to see you
fall in love with a Mobei prince,

119
00:06:58,729 --> 00:07:01,170
so he deliberately released assassins
from Mobei to kill her.

120
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:05,049
He just didn't expect that you would...

121
00:07:07,129 --> 00:07:08,249
So,

122
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:12,249
all of this was orchestrated
by him alone?

123
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:13,608
Just to...

124
00:07:13,609 --> 00:07:16,730
Even His Majesty didn't expect
that this move

125
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:18,728
would doom you beyond redemption.

126
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:19,890
Stop talking.

127
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:24,290
Actually, you later found out as well

128
00:07:24,369 --> 00:07:26,890
that my mother
was killed by my own father.

129
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:32,049
Why did all of you hide it from me?

130
00:07:32,809 --> 00:07:33,929
Yuwen Que.

131
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:37,529
Do you know how much
I've hated you all these years?

132
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:40,290
I know. I'd rather you hate me.

133
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:43,650
I only want you to live.

134
00:07:45,169 --> 00:07:46,969
You're no match for the Emperor.

135
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:50,129
I don't want to watch you die
for revenge.

136
00:07:51,369 --> 00:07:52,569
Why?

137
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:55,650
Why did he treat us like this?

138
00:08:15,850 --> 00:08:16,970
Di.

139
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:19,168
I bought this at the market.

140
00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:20,569
They say it wards off evil.

141
00:08:22,929 --> 00:08:24,290
Young lady, you're the best.

142
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:27,129
After all these years,

143
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:28,650
you still keep it?

144
00:08:30,689 --> 00:08:32,808
Young lady, I...

145
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:35,489
Let bygones be bygones.

146
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,169
Actually, all these years,

147
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:44,569
I was ordered by the Emperor
to protect you and your mother.

148
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:51,250
So all these years of friendship
were merely a duty?

149
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,368
No.

150
00:08:52,369 --> 00:08:53,650
I never...

151
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:54,729
Cui Di.

152
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:59,890
Our bond ends here.

153
00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:01,969
Young lady, please listen to me.

154
00:09:03,129 --> 00:09:04,049
From this day on,

155
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:05,929
we are no longer friends.

156
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:32,530
All these years, it was thanks
to Cui Di staying by your side.

157
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,729
She's the person I trust the most.

158
00:09:37,249 --> 00:09:38,650
More than me?

159
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:44,610
The dignified Crown Prince of Mobei,

160
00:09:44,729 --> 00:09:47,290
actually getting jealous
of my female guard.

161
00:09:48,249 --> 00:09:49,408
In front of you,

162
00:09:49,409 --> 00:09:51,250
I am only Yuwen Que.

163
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:55,049
Young lady, I'll take my leave first.

164
00:09:58,649 --> 00:10:01,049
By the way, I want to see your sword.

165
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:08,530
This is the Cangyu Sword.

166
00:10:09,369 --> 00:10:13,049
Forged from refined steel
of Cangzhou and quenched with jade.

167
00:10:13,129 --> 00:10:15,130
But isn't the Cangyu Sword...

168
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:16,449
That's right.

169
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:19,569
It's a tribute sent from Cangzhou
to Mobei every year.

170
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:21,410
Only five exist in the entire realm.

171
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:47,049
Yuwen Que.

172
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:49,770
Don't blame me.

173
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,890
Young lady, you can't enter the palace.

174
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:13,488
Step aside.

175
00:11:13,489 --> 00:11:14,728
He is the Emperor,

176
00:11:14,729 --> 00:11:15,969
your biological father.
