=Episode 12=

11
00:01:13,312 --> 00:01:15,236
(Jinhua Hall)

12
00:01:15,237 --> 00:01:16,517
Jinhua Hall?

13
00:01:17,197 --> 00:01:19,077
Yuwen Que lied to me.

14
00:01:19,597 --> 00:01:21,357
This isn't my bamboo cottage.

15
00:01:24,212 --> 00:01:27,995
(Jinhua Hall)

16
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:47,282
(Jinhua Hall)

17
00:02:24,278 --> 00:02:25,316
Who are you?

18
00:02:25,317 --> 00:02:26,438
Young Lady Shen,

19
00:02:26,597 --> 00:02:27,837
do you remember me?

20
00:02:28,558 --> 00:02:29,878
I'm Wen Ling.

21
00:02:33,878 --> 00:02:34,758
Young Lady Shen,

22
00:02:35,317 --> 00:02:37,318
you've been confined here
for a long time.

23
00:02:37,718 --> 00:02:39,917
Yuwen Que drugged your food

24
00:02:40,678 --> 00:02:42,158
and made you forget about everything.

25
00:02:42,357 --> 00:02:44,117
About General Su

26
00:02:44,917 --> 00:02:46,637
and the massacre of your family.

27
00:03:32,797 --> 00:03:34,117
So it's all true.

28
00:03:34,558 --> 00:03:35,718
It wasn't a dream.

29
00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:37,677
It's all real.

30
00:03:40,077 --> 00:03:41,117
All of it.

31
00:03:41,637 --> 00:03:42,837
Changji.

32
00:03:43,797 --> 00:03:44,517
Mother.

33
00:03:45,797 --> 00:03:46,797
I shouldn't.

34
00:03:47,558 --> 00:03:50,077
I shouldn't have forgotten
what he did to you all.

35
00:04:12,477 --> 00:04:13,237
Ru,

36
00:04:13,797 --> 00:04:15,278
is something on your mind?

37
00:04:18,317 --> 00:04:19,478
I was thinking

38
00:04:21,118 --> 00:04:23,238
what kind of flowers

39
00:04:24,998 --> 00:04:26,558
are worthy of you, Che.

40
00:04:34,957 --> 00:04:35,837
Look.

41
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:38,198
Doesn't it look like a crown?

42
00:04:39,397 --> 00:04:41,077
It's just

43
00:04:41,157 --> 00:04:42,717
missing a bit of blood.

44
00:04:48,517 --> 00:04:49,918
Why are you talking

45
00:04:51,678 --> 00:04:53,118
so strangely today?

46
00:04:57,598 --> 00:04:58,597
What?

47
00:04:58,837 --> 00:04:59,837
Che,

48
00:05:00,397 --> 00:05:02,077
you don't like the way I speak?

49
00:05:09,757 --> 00:05:11,077
I was wondering,

50
00:05:13,118 --> 00:05:14,517
when you ran your sword

51
00:05:15,317 --> 00:05:18,678
through my mother's chest, did it hurt?

52
00:05:19,317 --> 00:05:20,397
Ru.

53
00:05:22,077 --> 00:05:24,558
What? Feeling guilty now?

54
00:05:26,798 --> 00:05:28,238
Or are you afraid

55
00:05:29,637 --> 00:05:30,998
that I remember everything now?

56
00:05:31,038 --> 00:05:31,798
Ru,

57
00:05:31,918 --> 00:05:32,837
hear me out.

58
00:05:33,717 --> 00:05:34,837
Hear you out?

59
00:05:35,238 --> 00:05:36,678
What is there left to explain?

60
00:05:38,762 --> 00:05:40,282
Do you want to explain

61
00:05:41,077 --> 00:05:42,237
what you put

62
00:05:42,238 --> 00:05:43,717
in my food?

63
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:46,192
Or explain

64
00:05:48,757 --> 00:05:51,397
how you killed my family

65
00:05:53,918 --> 00:05:56,397
while whispering that you loved me?

66
00:05:56,678 --> 00:05:58,316
I just loved you too much.

67
00:05:58,317 --> 00:05:59,118
Love?

68
00:06:02,358 --> 00:06:03,878
You don't deserve to say love.

69
00:06:07,358 --> 00:06:08,438
Your love

70
00:06:09,717 --> 00:06:12,678
is scars carved into my body.

71
00:06:13,358 --> 00:06:14,678
In the end,

72
00:06:16,517 --> 00:06:19,682
you erased all my memories.

73
00:06:27,317 --> 00:06:28,238
Che,

74
00:06:29,157 --> 00:06:30,295
tell me.

75
00:06:31,062 --> 00:06:33,062
If I dig out your heart,

76
00:06:33,397 --> 00:06:35,477
will it be black?

77
00:06:40,077 --> 00:06:41,558
Even if it's black,

78
00:06:43,118 --> 00:06:44,957
it's because of you.

What's wrong, Young Lady?

93
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:52,917
You knew all along,

94
00:07:52,918 --> 00:07:54,477

Young Lady,

97
00:07:55,957 --> 00:07:57,517
I did it to protect you.

98
00:07:57,717 --> 00:07:58,637
Protect me?

99
00:08:00,598 --> 00:08:01,477
You've turned me

100
00:08:01,478 --> 00:08:04,037

I didn't want to see you like this.

103
00:08:10,678 --> 00:08:12,077
You didn't want me to take revenge?

104
00:08:13,517 --> 00:08:14,717
Or were you afraid

105
00:08:15,478 --> 00:08:17,678
I'd expose your lie?

106
00:08:19,118 --> 00:08:20,037
Di,

107
00:08:21,438 --> 00:08:22,397
I thought

108
00:08:23,358 --> 00:08:24,636
you were the last person

109
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:26,238
I could trust.

110
00:08:33,998 --> 00:08:34,918
Leave.

111
00:08:35,397 --> 00:08:36,076
Young Lady.

112
00:08:36,077 --> 00:08:37,037

You'll soon know

a boat courtesan's daughter

116
00:09:38,718 --> 00:09:39,798
will only

117
00:09:40,677 --> 00:09:42,837
ever drift on the water.

118
00:09:48,677 --> 00:09:51,438
This fabric is
vermilion silk cloud brocade.

119
00:09:52,238 --> 00:09:54,638
Even the stitches are embroidered
with gold thread.

120
00:09:54,718 --> 00:09:56,757
This is what I should be wearing.

121
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,318
Once I marry Yuwen Que,

122
00:10:00,838 --> 00:10:03,518
no one in this palace
will look down on me again.

123
00:10:08,478 --> 00:10:11,877
A boat courtesan's daughter
dares to wear a phoenix robe?

124
00:10:13,557 --> 00:10:15,158
At tomorrow's court assembly,

125
00:10:15,277 --> 00:10:16,877
you'll wear that outfit

126
00:10:16,878 --> 00:10:18,717
and dance in front of all the officials.

127
00:10:19,598 --> 00:10:21,077
Let everyone see

128
00:10:21,437 --> 00:10:23,477
what kind of woman

129
00:10:23,517 --> 00:10:25,798
the prince likes.

130
00:10:30,878 --> 00:10:32,636
The crown princess

131
00:10:32,637 --> 00:10:34,997
was never you.

132
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:38,638
You're finally here.

133
00:10:39,517 --> 00:10:41,318
Your Ladyship, this medicine...

134
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:42,518
I know.

135
00:10:43,998 --> 00:10:47,318
When the Soul-Drawing Fragrance
combines with this Gu poison,

136
00:10:47,478 --> 00:10:49,597
fifteen minutes is all it takes

137
00:10:49,757 --> 00:10:51,278
to make someone obedient.

138
00:10:51,478 --> 00:10:52,077
Yes.

139
00:11:03,437 --> 00:11:04,717
Perfect timing to wake up.

140
00:11:06,157 --> 00:11:07,237
You think

141
00:11:07,598 --> 00:11:08,997
you can control me?

142
00:11:10,157 --> 00:11:12,198
You think too highly of yourself.

143
00:11:12,517 --> 00:11:14,997
This is Soul-Drawing Fragrance
from Nanjiang.

144
00:11:15,277 --> 00:11:19,032
It can even lure out one's soul.

145
00:11:22,557 --> 00:11:23,558
Don't worry.

146
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:25,558
Soon,

147
00:11:26,037 --> 00:11:28,237
you won't need to worry
about anything at all.

148
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:36,158
Look.

149
00:11:36,478 --> 00:11:37,678
Isn't this better?

150
00:11:38,157 --> 00:11:39,477
Be obedient.

151
00:11:40,037 --> 00:11:41,678
It's good for everyone.

152
00:11:44,318 --> 00:11:45,837
Tomorrow at the court assembly,

153
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:47,678
I want her to dance

154
00:11:47,797 --> 00:11:50,477
harder than the dancers
in the pleasure houses.
