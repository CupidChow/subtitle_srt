=The Ultimate Vow, Unknown to You=

10
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,520
=Episode 23=

11
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:10,746
Report!

12
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:14,065
Your Highness, urgent news.

13
00:01:14,426 --> 00:01:15,345
What is it?

14
00:01:15,346 --> 00:01:17,065
His Majesty is gravely ill.

15
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:21,122
(Urgent report. The Emperor
is critically ill and near death.)

16
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:23,420
(The situation is dire.
Please come at once.)

17
00:01:26,626 --> 00:01:30,226
At this point, advancing or retreating
both lead to death.

18
00:01:30,385 --> 00:01:32,866
My top priority now is to return
to Mobei and ascend the throne.

19
00:01:33,546 --> 00:01:35,705
Once I command the hundred thousand
iron cavalry of Mobei,

20
00:01:35,906 --> 00:01:37,545
Cangzhou will not dare to act rashly.

21
00:01:37,546 --> 00:01:39,026
Your Highness, you mean...

22
00:01:39,305 --> 00:01:40,425
Issue the order.

23
00:01:40,585 --> 00:01:42,106
We depart for Mobei immediately.

24
00:01:42,146 --> 00:01:43,265
Also,

25
00:01:43,706 --> 00:01:45,104
have you found Ru's whereabouts?

26
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,265
I am incompetent.

27
00:01:46,506 --> 00:01:48,625
I only discovered she was sent
out of the capital.

28
00:01:48,825 --> 00:01:51,226
As for where she went...

29
00:01:52,225 --> 00:01:53,625
After I ascend the throne,

30
00:01:54,745 --> 00:01:58,065
I will spare no effort of Mobei
to find her.

31
00:02:02,346 --> 00:02:03,705
An imperial oral decree.

32
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:06,505
I appoint Yuwen Que
to inherit the throne,

33
00:02:06,585 --> 00:02:08,466
to ascend immediately.

34
00:02:08,825 --> 00:02:10,026
Assassins!

35
00:02:16,106 --> 00:02:17,584
What a fine show.

36
00:02:17,585 --> 00:02:19,184
A new Emperor ascends,

37
00:02:19,185 --> 00:02:20,945
old lovers reunite.

38
00:02:21,305 --> 00:02:22,385
Let her go!

39
00:02:22,546 --> 00:02:23,426
Don't move.

40
00:02:23,505 --> 00:02:25,344
I can't bear to hurt you.

41
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:27,945
What have you turned into?

42
00:02:30,986 --> 00:02:32,304
What have I become?

43
00:02:32,305 --> 00:02:35,345
For ten whole years,

44
00:02:36,986 --> 00:02:38,744
I've been trapped in this gilded cage,

45
00:02:38,745 --> 00:02:40,786
seeing through
all the world's hypocrisy.

46
00:02:40,787 --> 00:02:42,074
What do you want?

47
00:02:42,075 --> 00:02:44,744
This country should have belonged
to the Su family.

48
00:02:44,745 --> 00:02:46,865
The Mobei royal family seized
my ancestors' legacy,

49
00:02:46,866 --> 00:02:48,466
imprisoned me for ten years,

50
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:49,665
and now,

51
00:02:52,745 --> 00:02:54,945
you would take away the one I love most.

52
00:02:54,986 --> 00:02:58,105
Do you remember what you said
at the border that year

53
00:02:58,106 --> 00:03:00,344
that you would be a general
who would not fail the world?

54
00:03:00,345 --> 00:03:01,706
That foolish boy

55
00:03:03,585 --> 00:03:04,706
has long been dead.

56
00:03:06,826 --> 00:03:07,945
Choose.

57
00:03:08,706 --> 00:03:11,266
The throne or her.

58
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:19,026
The Su Army has pledged allegiance
to the new Emperor.

59
00:03:22,585 --> 00:03:23,466
Don't move!

60
00:03:27,426 --> 00:03:28,546
General.

61
00:03:28,785 --> 00:03:31,266
Put down the blade. Stop now.

62
00:03:31,546 --> 00:03:33,345
Even you betray me?

63
00:03:47,546 --> 00:03:48,665
Without you,

64
00:03:50,546 --> 00:03:51,746
what use is

65
00:03:53,106 --> 00:03:54,625
this country to me?

66
00:04:11,345 --> 00:04:12,665
It's over.

67
00:04:14,025 --> 00:04:16,625
Please, spare him.

68
00:04:17,386 --> 00:04:19,266
I never sought the throne.

69
00:04:19,426 --> 00:04:21,306
I only wished to earn merit and glory,

70
00:04:22,745 --> 00:04:24,145
to keep you safe.

71
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:30,306
But this world... This human heart...

72
00:04:33,986 --> 00:04:37,465
Father, I've failed you.

73
00:04:38,705 --> 00:04:39,785
Take him away.

74
00:04:39,786 --> 00:04:41,065
Guard him well.

75
00:04:53,786 --> 00:04:55,505
Your Ladyship.

76
00:04:56,426 --> 00:04:57,944
Why the panic?

77
00:04:57,945 --> 00:05:00,065
His Majesty has ascended the throne.

78
00:05:02,026 --> 00:05:03,426
Has an Empress been appointed?

79
00:05:03,745 --> 00:05:04,545
This...

80
00:05:04,546 --> 00:05:05,546
Speak.

81
00:05:07,145 --> 00:05:10,306
His Majesty has named Shen Qingru
as Empress.

82
00:05:11,106 --> 00:05:12,346
What did you say?

83
00:05:17,385 --> 00:05:18,546
Impossible.

84
00:05:20,026 --> 00:05:21,145
Isn't she...

85
00:05:23,305 --> 00:05:25,786
Isn't she already dead?

86
00:05:42,906 --> 00:05:45,226
In what way am I inferior to her?

87
00:05:48,145 --> 00:05:50,625
I am Princess Wen Ling.

88
00:05:50,945 --> 00:05:52,866
Your Ladyship is indeed
peerlessly beautiful.

89
00:05:55,145 --> 00:05:57,866
Quick, change my clothes.

90
00:05:58,145 --> 00:05:59,825
I'll wear that phoenix robe.

91
00:06:00,705 --> 00:06:03,465
Do you think I should be the Empress?

92
00:06:04,305 --> 00:06:07,065
That phoenix robe suits me perfectly.

93
00:06:08,705 --> 00:06:10,306
I'm nobler than her.

94
00:06:11,426 --> 00:06:13,106
I'm more beautiful than her.

95
00:06:14,426 --> 00:06:15,465
I...

96
00:06:19,026 --> 00:06:20,145
I...

97
00:06:27,986 --> 00:06:28,945
Don't cry.

98
00:06:30,505 --> 00:06:31,666
I mustn't cry.

99
00:06:32,385 --> 00:06:33,505
Wen Ling.

100
00:06:34,385 --> 00:06:35,666
Be elegant.

101
00:06:36,705 --> 00:06:38,025
Be dignified.

102
00:07:08,986 --> 00:07:10,106
So it turns out

103
00:07:11,586 --> 00:07:14,426
in the end, I was nothing at all.

104
00:07:41,226 --> 00:07:42,346
Your Ladyship.

105
00:08:07,546 --> 00:08:09,705
I've made my decision.

106
00:08:18,786 --> 00:08:22,025
Your Majesty, Her Ladyship requests
you go to Wen Ling Palace at once.

107
00:08:22,705 --> 00:08:23,744
At this hour?

108
00:08:23,745 --> 00:08:25,306
Let's go together.

109
00:08:25,586 --> 00:08:26,346
Alright.

110
00:08:34,786 --> 00:08:36,265
You're here.

111
00:08:36,986 --> 00:08:38,145
How nice.

112
00:08:38,706 --> 00:08:39,666
Wen Ling.

113
00:08:43,145 --> 00:08:45,105
Do you remember
when I first entered the palace?

114
00:08:45,905 --> 00:08:47,426
I was just a tiny little thing,

115
00:08:48,505 --> 00:08:51,146
hiding behind Auntie,
too afraid to come out.

116
00:08:52,145 --> 00:08:53,465
Back then,

117
00:08:54,505 --> 00:08:58,225
my whole world was just Auntie and you.

118
00:08:58,265 --> 00:09:00,065
Wait for me!

119
00:09:00,066 --> 00:09:01,384
Wait for me!

120
00:09:01,385 --> 00:09:03,570
Wait for me!

121
00:09:03,586 --> 00:09:04,945
After Auntie passed away,

122
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,057
I became even more afraid,

123
00:09:09,986 --> 00:09:11,426
afraid of being alone,

124
00:09:11,905 --> 00:09:13,506
afraid of being abandoned.

125
00:09:18,186 --> 00:09:22,065
So I always followed behind you,

126
00:09:24,025 --> 00:09:28,186
step by step, walking in your shadow.

127
00:09:32,306 --> 00:09:36,945
I thought that way I would
never lose you.

128
00:09:38,545 --> 00:09:39,825
How ridiculous.

129
00:09:40,826 --> 00:09:43,105
Ever since you met Shen Qingru,

130
00:09:44,706 --> 00:09:47,225
you were willing
to give up everything for her,

131
00:09:47,905 --> 00:09:49,825
even your status as a prince.

132
00:09:50,745 --> 00:09:52,465
But did you ever think

133
00:09:52,826 --> 00:09:55,426
the moment you chose to let go,

134
00:09:57,946 --> 00:10:00,026
where was I supposed to go?

135
00:10:01,346 --> 00:10:02,465
Wen Ling.

136
00:10:03,785 --> 00:10:05,225
Let me finish.

137
00:10:09,826 --> 00:10:11,345
From childhood until now,

138
00:10:12,505 --> 00:10:14,825
there was only you in my eyes.

139
00:10:16,706 --> 00:10:18,225
But

140
00:10:20,785 --> 00:10:23,026
you left me behind.

141
00:10:27,145 --> 00:10:28,266
I'm sorry.

142
00:10:31,905 --> 00:10:33,465
So I hated.

143
00:10:34,785 --> 00:10:36,426
I hated until I went mad.

144
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:41,546
That day in court,

145
00:10:41,946 --> 00:10:43,906
I knelt and begged the Emperor

146
00:10:44,346 --> 00:10:47,345
to grant marriage to General Su
and Shen Qingru.

147
00:10:48,385 --> 00:10:49,705
I thought

148
00:10:50,946 --> 00:10:52,666
as long as I tore you apart,

149
00:10:53,946 --> 00:10:55,825
I could keep you by my side.

150
00:10:56,226 --> 00:10:57,865
Only now do I understand

151
00:10:58,706 --> 00:11:01,065
that I never truly understood
what love was.

152
00:11:03,785 --> 00:11:05,225
From childhood to now,

153
00:11:06,745 --> 00:11:09,065
I was like someone without direction,

154
00:11:10,025 --> 00:11:12,504
desperately clinging
to the only familiar shadow.

155
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:15,065
You became everything I chased.
