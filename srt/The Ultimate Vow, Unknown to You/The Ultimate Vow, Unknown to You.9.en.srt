(Try to make His Highness unconscious.
I'll meet at the east gate)

12
00:01:10,985 --> 00:01:12,008
(of Chengguang Hall at midnight.
If successful,)

13
00:01:12,009 --> 00:01:13,482
(we can leave the capital
in three days.)

14
00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:21,035
Greetings, Your Highness.

15
00:01:36,034 --> 00:01:36,994
What's wrong?

16
00:01:44,674 --> 00:01:45,794
You were greedy again.

17
00:02:01,954 --> 00:02:03,070
All these years,

18
00:02:03,394 --> 00:02:04,795
you're still the same.

19
00:02:05,274 --> 00:02:06,875
Do you remember
that year at the bamboo hut?

20
00:02:07,075 --> 00:02:08,595
You stole the preserved fruit I hid,

21
00:02:09,234 --> 00:02:10,514
and choked just like this.

22
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:12,395
You have no right to bring up the past.

23
00:02:27,995 --> 00:02:30,435
Your Highness. The Imperial Medical Institute
has prepared the medicine.

24
00:02:30,754 --> 00:02:33,394
It's time for your medicinal bath.
You must not delay for three days.

25
00:02:41,914 --> 00:02:42,834
Wait for me to return.

26
00:02:59,715 --> 00:03:01,114
Madam, please go quickly.

27
00:03:03,594 --> 00:03:04,394
(No.)

28
00:03:04,555 --> 00:03:05,634
(Just in case,)

29
00:03:05,955 --> 00:03:08,234
(I must make sure he can't catch up.)

30
00:03:09,235 --> 00:03:10,354
Tonight at midnight,

31
00:03:10,634 --> 00:03:12,354
I must escape this cage.

32
00:03:53,835 --> 00:03:54,715
You may leave.

33
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:56,435
I'll wipe myself.

34
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:25,675
With just this,

35
00:04:25,795 --> 00:04:27,074
you think you can kill me?

36
00:04:27,834 --> 00:04:29,154
It's just a pity.

37
00:04:29,355 --> 00:04:31,514
I won't let you get your wish so easily.

38
00:04:33,795 --> 00:04:35,195
If you want to kill me, then do it.

39
00:04:35,235 --> 00:04:36,355
Otherwise,

40
00:04:36,475 --> 00:04:38,435
I'll make you regret sparing my life.

41
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:42,995

53
00:05:37,834 --> 00:05:39,074
There's no time to waste.

54
00:05:47,274 --> 00:05:49,073
General Su, we're about to leave the city gate.

55
00:05:49,074 --> 00:05:51,560
Are you willing to give up
the title of General and leave with me?

56
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,132
Ru.

57
00:05:52,154 --> 00:05:53,674
Do you remember what you said

58
00:05:53,675 --> 00:05:54,434
when we first met?

59
00:05:54,435 --> 00:05:55,393
What did I say?

60
00:05:55,394 --> 00:05:55,994
You said,

61
00:05:55,995 --> 00:05:57,555
the rarest thing in this world

62
00:05:57,675 --> 00:05:58,954
is not peerless martial skill,

63
00:05:59,194 --> 00:06:00,594
but a fearless heart.

64
00:06:01,514 --> 00:06:02,915
Let's charge out together.

65
00:06:07,435 --> 00:06:08,554
Close the city gates!

66
00:06:08,555 --> 00:06:10,315
Hurry! Close the gates!

67
00:06:15,235 --> 00:06:16,675
Archers, get ready!

68
00:06:31,475 --> 00:06:32,875
Don't let them escape!

69
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:49,675
Ru!

70
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:00,352
Dear.

71
00:07:00,394 --> 00:07:01,674
He will kill you!

72
00:07:01,675 --> 00:07:03,520
If I don't even have this resolve,

73
00:07:04,154 --> 00:07:05,394
how could I be worthy of you?

74
00:07:05,514 --> 00:07:07,074
His arrows never miss.

75
00:07:07,194 --> 00:07:07,834
Ru.

76
00:07:08,954 --> 00:07:10,514
Do you know how long I've waited

77
00:07:10,634 --> 00:07:11,675
for this day?

78
00:07:12,714 --> 00:07:13,954
If I retreat today,

79
00:07:14,274 --> 00:07:15,834
I would betray my own heart.

80
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:17,514
What a devoted fool.

81
00:07:19,435 --> 00:07:21,195
Today, I want to see

82
00:07:21,714 --> 00:07:23,474
whether your heart matters more,

83
00:07:24,115 --> 00:07:25,234
or your life.

84
00:07:25,235 --> 00:07:27,235
You and her have long
since severed all ties.

85
00:07:27,514 --> 00:07:28,634
The past is like dust,

86
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:30,114
let it scatter with the wind.

87
00:07:30,115 --> 00:07:31,474
Since that's the case,

88
00:07:32,795 --> 00:07:34,435
I'll send you on your way.

89
00:07:35,274 --> 00:07:36,115
Ru.

90
00:07:36,714 --> 00:07:38,355
No matter what lies ahead,

91
00:07:38,555 --> 00:07:39,915
I'll take you through.

92
00:07:40,555 --> 00:07:41,634
Yuwen Que!

93
00:07:42,954 --> 00:07:44,034
You and I

94
00:07:44,035 --> 00:07:45,514
have long since become water spilled.

95
00:07:45,634 --> 00:07:47,074
Why won't you understand?

96
00:07:47,475 --> 00:07:48,355
Ru.

97
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:49,914
You don't need to say more to him.

98
00:07:49,915 --> 00:07:51,235
I'll take you and charge out now.

99
00:07:51,455 --> 00:07:52,915
- Aren't you afraid?
- Afraid of what?

100
00:07:53,235 --> 00:07:54,154
Afraid of death?

101
00:07:55,995 --> 00:07:57,555
If it's to die for you,

102
00:07:58,194 --> 00:07:59,675
then my life has no regrets.

103
00:08:14,115 --> 00:08:14,633
Be careful.

104
00:08:14,634 --> 00:08:15,555
Shoot!

105
00:08:18,274 --> 00:08:19,675
No!

106
00:08:20,074 --> 00:08:21,755
Shoot!

107
00:08:30,274 --> 00:08:32,514
Stop! Everyone stop!

108
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:35,875
Who gave you the order?

109
00:08:40,475 --> 00:08:41,268
No.

110
00:08:42,995 --> 00:08:44,114
It's not like that.

111
00:08:46,634 --> 00:08:47,714
General Su.

112
00:08:51,995 --> 00:08:52,754
Ru.

113
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:57,395
It's not like that.

114
00:09:10,595 --> 00:09:11,714
General Su,

115
00:09:11,754 --> 00:09:12,707
why did you...

116
00:09:14,914 --> 00:09:15,795
Ru,

117
00:09:17,674 --> 00:09:19,515
I actually knew all along.

118
00:09:19,634 --> 00:09:20,834
Knew what?

119
00:09:22,235 --> 00:09:23,754
I knew that you

120
00:09:23,995 --> 00:09:26,435
and Yuwen Que had a past.

121
00:09:28,394 --> 00:09:29,795
I knew that you two

122
00:09:29,995 --> 00:09:31,435
were once

123
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,315
very close.

124
00:09:34,914 --> 00:09:36,834
Then why did you still...

125
00:09:36,914 --> 00:09:38,114
Because...

126
00:09:40,554 --> 00:09:42,474
Because I love you.

127
00:09:45,595 --> 00:09:48,994
Watching you trapped
in the palace by him,

128
00:09:50,794 --> 00:09:53,874
how could I not take you away?

129
00:09:56,235 --> 00:09:58,395
From now on,

130
00:09:59,835 --> 00:10:03,114
I can no longer protect you.

131
00:10:04,955 --> 00:10:06,155
I only fear...

132
00:10:07,075 --> 00:10:08,195
I fear for you

133
00:10:09,115 --> 00:10:10,155
alone

134
00:10:10,914 --> 00:10:12,035
in this world.

135
00:10:12,514 --> 00:10:13,195
No.

136
00:10:13,595 --> 00:10:15,155
Don't say any more.

137
00:10:16,274 --> 00:10:18,474
I beg you, don't say any more.

138
00:10:19,034 --> 00:10:20,074
Ru,

139
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:22,754
don't cry.

140
00:10:23,835 --> 00:10:25,435
If you cry,

141
00:10:25,595 --> 00:10:27,555
even as a ghost,

142
00:10:29,835 --> 00:10:32,474
I'll come back to wipe your tears.

143
00:10:35,514 --> 00:10:36,754
I'm not afraid of death.

144
00:10:38,634 --> 00:10:39,714
I only fear...

145
00:10:41,995 --> 00:10:44,234
I only fear you being alone.

146
00:10:47,674 --> 00:10:48,635
Ru,

147
00:10:49,674 --> 00:10:51,114
do you still remember

148
00:10:53,195 --> 00:10:55,474
when we first met?

149
00:10:57,355 --> 00:10:58,354
I remember.

150
00:10:58,995 --> 00:11:00,354
I remember everything.

151
00:11:00,674 --> 00:11:01,795
I was in my prime,

152
00:11:02,835 --> 00:11:04,195
meant to achieve great things.

153
00:11:04,754 --> 00:11:07,354
But now, my ambitions are unfulfilled,

154
00:11:07,475 --> 00:11:09,114
and I cannot understand why.

155
00:11:10,075 --> 00:11:11,474
How can this inner frustration

156
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:13,114
be resolved?

157
00:11:13,115 --> 00:11:14,994
The man taken control of Central Plains,

158
00:11:15,394 --> 00:11:17,594
yet before dividing the rod,
the old fishing boat remains.

159
00:11:18,034 --> 00:11:18,994
Who is that?

160
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:20,795
Living as a recluse is easy,

161
00:11:21,195 --> 00:11:24,114
but what about this unresolved anger
in the heart?

162
00:11:24,715 --> 00:11:26,795
One must believe
that a hundred years are but a dream.

163
00:11:27,115 --> 00:11:29,675
The world is vast.
Let us wander within it.
