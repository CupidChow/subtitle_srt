00:02:33,381 --> 00:02:35,760

His Highness is going

00:02:44,682 --> 00:02:45,921
Shush.

36
00:02:48,922 --> 00:02:50,201
Your Highness.

37
00:02:50,202 --> 00:02:51,442
General Su,

38
00:02:51,601 --> 00:02:53,442
you should leave.

39
00:02:53,481 --> 00:02:56,121
- If someone sees us...
- Let me stay a little longer.

40
00:02:56,122 --> 00:02:56,921
Mother!

41
00:03:01,802 --> 00:03:02,921

00:03:09,601 --> 00:03:10,801
Que!

43
00:03:15,321 --> 00:03:16,401
Father...

44
00:03:16,402 --> 00:03:17,722
Father is the emperor.

45
00:03:18,402 --> 00:03:20,801
How could you...

46
00:03:24,082 --> 00:03:26,442
Why? Why?

47
00:03:26,481 --> 00:03:28,442
Why? Why?

48
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,607
(General's Residence)

49
00:03:59,402 --> 00:04:00,921
First bow to the heaven and earth.

50
00:04:01,321 --> 00:04:03,081
Why is it that everyone I love...

51
00:04:05,922 --> 00:04:07,722
Ends up betraying me?

52
00:04:12,522 --> 00:04:13,601
Why?

53
00:04:15,402 --> 00:04:16,682
Why?

54
00:04:17,682 --> 00:04:18,801
Your Highness.

55
00:04:20,721 --> 00:04:21,842
Your Highness!

56
00:04:22,522 --> 00:04:23,642
Your Highness?

57
00:04:24,082 --> 00:04:25,241
Ru...

58
00:04:26,322 --> 00:04:27,441
Your Highness?

Ru...

60
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:34,241
Your Highness, I've come to see you.

61
00:04:34,801 --> 00:04:35,921
Get out.

62
00:04:37,002 --> 00:04:38,121
Get out!

63
00:04:39,721 --> 00:04:41,600
Your Ladyship, let's go back.

64
00:04:41,601 --> 00:04:42,601
Ru...

65
00:04:47,161 --> 00:04:48,322

Ru...

67
00:04:53,002 --> 00:04:54,282
Don't leave me, Ru.

68
00:04:55,202 --> 00:04:56,322
Don't leave me.

69
00:05:05,161 --> 00:05:07,202
(I've never heard him speak with anyone)

70
00:05:07,675 --> 00:05:10,596
(with such gentle tone before.)

71
00:05:25,921 --> 00:05:27,160
Who is Ru?

72
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:28,642
Your Ladyship,

73
00:05:28,681 --> 00:05:30,680
she's General Su's newly wedded wife,

74
00:05:30,681 --> 00:05:31,961
Shen Qingru.

75
00:05:31,962 --> 00:05:33,482
The general's wife?

76
00:05:33,882 --> 00:05:35,321
Then why would His Highness...

77
00:05:35,322 --> 00:05:37,761
I heard that His Highness
returned unsummoned.

78
00:05:37,762 --> 00:05:40,680
He intended to seize the bride
on General Su's wedding,

79
00:05:40,681 --> 00:05:42,681
but was wounded by the bride.

80
00:05:43,642 --> 00:05:44,642
He...

81
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,967
He would go that far for a woman?

82
00:05:56,721 --> 00:06:00,001
Ten years... Ten whole years.

83
00:06:02,681 --> 00:06:05,282
I've spent by his side in the palace,
growing up with him,

84
00:06:05,921 --> 00:06:07,522
seeing his sorrows

85
00:06:08,082 --> 00:06:09,801
and his joys.

86
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:13,601
Yet in his eyes, I was never there.

87
00:06:13,962 --> 00:06:14,600
Your Ladyship.

88
00:06:14,601 --> 00:06:16,121
And now, for her,

89
00:06:17,161 --> 00:06:19,202
he would cast aside
even the dignity of a prince.

90
00:06:20,522 --> 00:06:21,601
Your Ladyship.

91
00:06:23,522 --> 00:06:25,241
I must see for myself,

92
00:06:25,721 --> 00:06:28,481
just what power does
Shen Qingru possess,

93
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:31,120
to steal his heart so completely?

94
00:06:31,121 --> 00:06:33,241
Your Ladyship, you mustn't...

95
00:06:34,202 --> 00:06:35,049
Your Ladyship!

96
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:37,620

97
00:06:41,637 --> 00:06:45,520
(Wedding)

98
00:06:48,281 --> 00:06:51,321
(Yuwen Que, you will never know)

99
00:06:51,322 --> 00:06:54,480
(that marrying Su Changji is
only the beginning of my revenge.)

100
00:06:54,481 --> 00:06:56,001
Here, Qingru.

101
00:06:56,202 --> 00:06:57,441
Are you alright?

102
00:06:57,681 --> 00:06:58,842
General,

103
00:06:58,962 --> 00:07:01,601
I'm feeling unwell tonight.

104
00:07:02,161 --> 00:07:03,322
I'm really sorry.

105
00:07:09,281 --> 00:07:10,201
Shen Qingru!

106
00:07:10,202 --> 00:07:11,842
Your Ladyship, you can't go in there!

107
00:07:16,402 --> 00:07:17,522
You shameless wretch!

108
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,360
His Highness broke the rule by
rushing back to the capital for you,

109
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:22,241
and you dare marry another?

110
00:07:22,402 --> 00:07:25,561
His Highness? What right does he
have to stop me from getting married?

111
00:07:25,562 --> 00:07:27,720
How heartless you are!

112
00:07:27,721 --> 00:07:28,801
Prepare to die!

113
00:07:32,361 --> 00:07:33,481
Your Ladyship,

114
00:07:33,921 --> 00:07:36,361
you trespassed into my residence
on my wedding day.

115
00:07:36,442 --> 00:07:38,441
I'll report this matter to His Majesty.

116
00:07:40,361 --> 00:07:42,241
She broke His Highness's heart.

117
00:07:43,002 --> 00:07:44,401
She will pay for it with her blood!

118
00:07:44,402 --> 00:07:45,361
Your Ladyship!

119
00:07:59,801 --> 00:08:01,120
Whoever tries to hurt you,

120
00:08:01,121 --> 00:08:02,601
I won't let them off.

121
00:08:07,281 --> 00:08:08,441
Ru...

122
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:10,241
You're awake, Your Highness.

123
00:08:10,962 --> 00:08:13,601
- I'm going to the General's Residence.
- Don't bother.

124
00:08:14,601 --> 00:08:16,441
I just came back from there.

125
00:08:17,202 --> 00:08:20,722
They have slept together.

126
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,421
That's impossible.

127
00:08:23,522 --> 00:08:25,202
I saw it with my own eyes.

128
00:08:25,987 --> 00:08:28,601
Miss Shen was exceedingly
tender toward General Su.

129
00:08:28,962 --> 00:08:30,842
It's a world apart from
how she ever treated you.

130
00:08:35,562 --> 00:08:36,882
Very well.

131
00:08:37,922 --> 00:08:39,002
Very well.

132
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:42,002
Shen Qingru...

133
00:08:42,975 --> 00:08:45,705
I will make you pay for this.

134
00:08:51,601 --> 00:08:53,281
Once I thank His Majesty
and settle things,

135
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:54,561
I'll take you out for a stroll.

136
00:08:54,562 --> 00:08:55,681
I'd like that.

137
00:09:06,282 --> 00:09:08,480
Greetings, Your Highness.

138
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:11,161
How very lucky of you, Madam.

139
00:09:11,162 --> 00:09:12,602
It's all thanks to you, Your Highness.

140
00:09:14,481 --> 00:09:17,441
Your Highness, I should take my wife to
the Jinluan Hall to thank His Majesty.

141
00:09:31,082 --> 00:09:32,921
Your Majesty, I have a petition.

142
00:09:33,282 --> 00:09:34,360
(Emperor of Mobei)
Speak, General.

143
00:09:34,361 --> 00:09:37,520
The border conflicts are intensifying.
I request permission to lead the campaign.

144
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,961
You have just been married, General.

145
00:09:38,962 --> 00:09:40,681
Why rush to the battlefield?

146
00:09:40,682 --> 00:09:42,760
I have no wish to be an idle general.

147
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,000
My family has served the nation
through warfare for generations.

148
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,122
Must this legacy end with me?

149
00:09:50,282 --> 00:09:52,120
Father, I volunteer to go.

150
00:09:52,121 --> 00:09:53,721
Good.

151
00:09:54,121 --> 00:09:55,480
Que is young

152
00:09:55,481 --> 00:09:57,201
and indeed requires experience.

153
00:09:58,001 --> 00:09:59,441
Have you forgotten, Your Majesty?

154
00:09:59,521 --> 00:10:01,681
His Highness returned to
the capital without summons,

155
00:10:01,682 --> 00:10:03,600
an act of insubordination
against military orders.

156
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,841
According to martial law, desertion
of post carries a penalty of 50 strokes.

157
00:10:08,361 --> 00:10:10,520
Do you intend
to show favoritism, Your Majesty?

158
00:10:10,521 --> 00:10:11,681
How dare you!

159
00:10:15,721 --> 00:10:18,081
Your Majesty, may I say something?

160
00:10:18,082 --> 00:10:19,002
You may.

161
00:10:19,162 --> 00:10:20,760
His Majesty's unauthorized return

162
00:10:20,761 --> 00:10:23,321
may well have been for
some significant matter.

163
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:24,242
Ru...

164
00:10:24,322 --> 00:10:26,681
However, if he violated military
orders for private reasons,

165
00:10:26,682 --> 00:10:29,642
then redoubling his punishment
would not be excessive.

166
00:10:37,922 --> 00:10:40,961
So be it. Command the Ministry of Rites
to draft the decree immediately.

167
00:10:40,962 --> 00:10:41,801
General Su,

168
00:10:41,802 --> 00:10:44,402
you'll oversee the preparations
for the Gods' Bathing Festival.

169
00:10:44,562 --> 00:10:46,041
As for Que,

170
00:10:46,042 --> 00:10:47,441
the military punishment

171
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:49,801
shall be enforced without leniency.

172
00:10:52,282 --> 00:10:53,480
Yes, Father.

173
00:10:53,481 --> 00:10:55,801
A wise and just decision, Your Majesty.

174
00:10:59,812 --> 00:11:01,002
(Ru,)

175
00:11:01,641 --> 00:11:03,882
(are you really doing this to me?)

176
00:11:11,082 --> 00:11:14,242
- Feeling pleased with yourself, are you?
- Your Highness, what a thing to say.

177
00:11:14,322 --> 00:11:16,201
I was merely speaking out for fairness.

178
00:11:16,282 --> 00:11:16,520
You...

179
00:11:16,521 --> 00:11:18,760
The cane may be painful, Your Highness,

180
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,800
but it could never compare
to a stab through the heart.

181
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,961
Don't you agree?

182
00:11:27,241 --> 00:11:29,162
Qingru, let's go home.

183
00:11:37,361 --> 00:11:39,281
(Very well, wife of the General.)

184
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:40,841
(Very well, Shen Qingru.)

185
00:11:40,842 --> 00:11:42,880
(You betrayed me and
became another man's wife.)
