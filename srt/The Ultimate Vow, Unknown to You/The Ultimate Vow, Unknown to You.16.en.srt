=The Ultimate Vow, Unknown to You=

10
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,520
=Episode 16=

11
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,900
Yuwen Que led his troops
to massacre my entire family.

12
00:01:12,219 --> 00:01:13,459
What's there to explain?

13
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,360
It's not like that.

14
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,679
Your mother was called
a boat courtesan,

15
00:01:15,679 --> 00:01:17,520
but she was actually the Emperor
of Cangzhou's favored concubine.

16
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:18,579
The prince Yuwen Que

17
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:20,220
was not your mother's true enemy.

18
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:21,363
Impossible.

19
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,349
But I clearly saw him.

20
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:24,961
Back then, your mother was set up.

21
00:01:24,962 --> 00:01:25,912
That's why...

22
00:01:26,559 --> 00:01:27,907
Could it be that all these years

23
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:29,900
I've hated the wrong person?

24
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:33,659
Young Lady Shen,

25
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,340
what you saw was not the truth.

26
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,500
The one who truly harmed
your mother is someone else.

27
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,882
So it really wasn't him?

28
00:01:40,825 --> 00:01:42,019
Then tell me,

29
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,379
who was the real culprit?

30
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:43,939
This...

31
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:44,418
Say it.

32
00:01:44,419 --> 00:01:46,220
Young lady, the buns are ready.

33
00:01:50,419 --> 00:01:51,579
The buns are here.

34
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:04,899
Young lady,

35
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,060
it's getting late.

36
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,258
Let's go back.

37
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:08,299
You go ahead.

38
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,459
I'll take a look around.

39
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,300
Young lady,

40
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:16,379
I want to tell you something.

41
00:02:18,339 --> 00:02:19,300
What is it?

42
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:22,500
Since you've already heard it,

43
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,740
I want to tell you the truth
about your origin.

44
00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:32,160
(Your father is the Emperor of Cangzhou)
Young lady, this letter

45
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,400
was given to me by your mother
before she died to pass on to you.

46
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,589
So it turns out

47
00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:38,979
I am just an abandoned child
of the Emperor of Cangzhou.

48
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:40,778
No wonder my mother said before she died

49
00:02:40,779 --> 00:02:42,060
not to hate.

50
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:42,939
Young lady,

51
00:02:43,059 --> 00:02:45,058
your mother was
also powerless back then.

52
00:02:45,059 --> 00:02:46,500
Powerless?

53
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,338
Then why did he abandon me and my mother

54
00:02:48,339 --> 00:02:49,845
in Cangzhou?

55
00:02:50,539 --> 00:02:51,419
Why?

56
00:02:52,219 --> 00:02:54,979
Why did he let Yuwen Que's
family try to exterminate us?

57
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,145
Do you know

58
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,780
why she told you not to hate?

59
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,699
Because she knew

60
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,459
your father was also powerless.

61
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:03,180
Is it just because he's high and mighty?

62
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:05,857
Because he's the Emperor?

63
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,020
Do you remember those people
who protected you on the road?

64
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,979
Those people were probably secret guards
sent by His Majesty.

65
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,180
Even so,

66
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:20,979
then why does he never appear?

67
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:21,819
Maybe

68
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,459
he's afraid you would hate him.

69
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,979
I think even as an Emperor,

70
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:27,060
he has attachments he cannot let go of.

71
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:33,220
(Cangzhou Prefecture)

72
00:03:38,212 --> 00:03:42,245
(Cangzhou Prefecture)

73
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:44,979
(Mother.)

74
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,699
(Should I)

75
00:03:47,379 --> 00:03:48,539
(take this step?)

76
00:04:08,725 --> 00:04:11,618
(Emperor of Cangzhou)

77
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:12,740
Qingru.

78
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,780
Hearing Your Majesty

79
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:17,139
call me this is really intimate.

80
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,459
Over the years...

81
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,657
Your Majesty, show restraint.

82
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:23,859
You're not worthy to be my father.

83
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,299
Qingru.

84
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,380
Back then,

85
00:04:35,779 --> 00:04:37,619
I had no choice.

86
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:39,940
Had no choice?

87
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:43,099
Then when my mother
was being chased and killed,

88
00:04:43,339 --> 00:04:44,539
where were you?

89
00:04:45,099 --> 00:04:46,739
When we were hiding,

90
00:04:46,859 --> 00:04:48,020
where were you then?

91
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:54,361
Qingru,

92
00:04:54,362 --> 00:04:55,899
hold on a little longer.

93
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:56,699
Mother,

94
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,419
I want my father.

95
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,218
Be good.

96
00:04:59,219 --> 00:05:00,499
Hold on.

97
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,845
(Apothecary)

98
00:05:02,779 --> 00:05:03,757
Yes.

99
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:07,032
You are the Emperor of Cangzhou.

100
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,858
How could you ruin your reputation

101
00:05:09,859 --> 00:05:11,220
for a boat courtesan

102
00:05:11,739 --> 00:05:12,978
and her daughter?

103
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,539
That's not how it was.

104
00:05:15,179 --> 00:05:17,059
I sent people to search for you.

105
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:19,099
Then why didn't you
go find her yourself?

106
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:22,220
Why did you let her
bear everything alone?

107
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:24,380
Do you know?

108
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,659
When I was little,

109
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:28,659
every time I saw other children
cherished by their fathers,

110
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,419
I would wonder

111
00:05:33,339 --> 00:05:35,499
why didn't my father want me?

112
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:36,900
Qingru.

113
00:05:37,099 --> 00:05:37,738
Qingru.

114
00:05:37,739 --> 00:05:39,179
Before my mother died,

115
00:05:39,219 --> 00:05:40,870
she was still making excuses for you,

116
00:05:42,339 --> 00:05:44,520
saying you truly loved her.

117
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,095
But your love

118
00:05:46,739 --> 00:05:49,380
was watching her die with your own eyes.

119
00:05:50,779 --> 00:05:51,979
As your father,

120
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:56,539
I am sorry to you both.

121
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,332
One "sorry"

122
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,020
and you think it erases 18 years?

123
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,179
Qingru.

124
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,020
Let me make it up to you.

125
00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:06,380
From this day on,

126
00:06:06,979 --> 00:06:08,819
you will be the Princess of Cangzhou.

127
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:09,900
I don't need it.

128
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,619
Qingru.

129
00:06:12,099 --> 00:06:13,780
You may hate me,

130
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,298
but please give me one chance.

131
00:06:16,299 --> 00:06:17,619
Do you know?

132
00:06:17,739 --> 00:06:18,739
I keep thinking

133
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,340
if back then,

134
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,020
you had stood up to protect us,

135
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:28,260
maybe my mother wouldn't have died.

136
00:06:29,339 --> 00:06:30,700
Maybe

137
00:06:31,237 --> 00:06:33,359
I wouldn't have taken this path either.

138
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:51,245
(Mother.)

139
00:06:52,299 --> 00:06:54,099
(Isn't it ridiculous?)

140
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,499
(The one
who should have protected us most)

141
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:00,260
(became the most cowardly of all.)

142
00:07:01,662 --> 00:07:05,020
(Cangzhou)

143
00:07:11,299 --> 00:07:12,140
Young lady.

144
00:07:22,539 --> 00:07:23,460
Di.

145
00:07:24,219 --> 00:07:25,470
Tell me,

146
00:07:26,339 --> 00:07:27,778
who are you really?

147
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:29,739
Why do you know so much?

148
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,380
Young lady.

149
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,738
All these years, I have been acting
under the Emperor's orders

150
00:07:35,739 --> 00:07:37,357
to protect you and your mother.

151
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,259
So these ten-plus years of affection

152
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,940
were merely duty?

153
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,140
No.

154
00:07:45,219 --> 00:07:46,299
I never...

155
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,499
Cui Di.

156
00:07:48,739 --> 00:07:50,460
Whatever bond we had

157
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,940
ends here.

158
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:54,979
Young lady, listen to me.

159
00:07:55,859 --> 00:07:57,140
From this moment on,

160
00:07:57,179 --> 00:07:58,940
we are no longer friends.

161
00:08:13,859 --> 00:08:15,700
I truly cared for you.

162
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:22,218
Your Highness.

163
00:08:22,219 --> 00:08:23,379
Let us charge in together

164
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:24,419
and rescue Her Ladyship.

165
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:26,340
No.

166
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,859
We won the first battle

167
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,179
during the war with Cangzhou.

168
00:08:29,659 --> 00:08:30,700
We must remain vigilant.

169
00:08:31,099 --> 00:08:32,580
I'll go alone.

170
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:37,620
(Cangzhou Prefecture)

171
00:08:40,459 --> 00:08:42,019
Your Majesty, urgent report!

172
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,220
Speak.

173
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,940
In the battle of Mobei,
our army suffered a crushing defeat.

174
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,330
The Eighth Prince

175
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,739
fell on the battlefield.

176
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:50,607
What?

177
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,739
This...

178
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,339
The Crown Prince of Mobei,
Yuwen Que has arrived outside the city.

179
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:55,779
He requests peace talks.

180
00:08:56,419 --> 00:08:58,859
My son...

181
00:09:10,699 --> 00:09:12,178
Did he come alone?

182
00:09:12,179 --> 00:09:13,139
Yes.

183
00:09:13,179 --> 00:09:14,540
Open the city gates.

184
00:09:14,939 --> 00:09:16,259
Your Majesty.

185
00:09:17,659 --> 00:09:19,779
Go summon the princess.

186
00:09:23,819 --> 00:09:24,899
Who is there?

187
00:09:37,659 --> 00:09:39,259
Ru, I've come to take you away.

188
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,219
Yuwen Que.

189
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,019
You're not capable of that.

190
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,420
You used me.

191
00:09:56,659 --> 00:09:58,859
The arrow is poisoned.

192
00:09:59,275 --> 00:10:01,099
What a perfect trap.

193
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,220
Today will be your death.

194
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,178
It's too dangerous.

195
00:10:04,179 --> 00:10:05,220
Go, now!

196
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:06,940
Loose the arrows!

197
00:10:18,539 --> 00:10:19,499
Don't move!

198
00:10:23,659 --> 00:10:24,660
Ru.

199
00:10:25,179 --> 00:10:26,379
Why did you save me?

200
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:29,259
If I let you die so easily,

201
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,739
wouldn't that be letting you off?

202
00:10:31,419 --> 00:10:33,460
I haven't taken my revenge yet.

203
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,660
Ru!

204
00:10:34,699 --> 00:10:36,979
You even kill using
such despicable means.

205
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,139
Emperor of Cangzhou.

206
00:10:42,299 --> 00:10:43,499
I will repay tenfold

207
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,379
for today's hatred.

208
00:10:48,925 --> 00:10:51,486
♪Counting in solitude alone♪

209
00:10:51,487 --> 00:10:54,178
♪Counting the cold in your eyes♪

210
00:10:54,179 --> 00:10:55,820
What have I done?

211
00:10:56,779 --> 00:10:58,859
What have I done?

212
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,739
Chase them! Don't let them escape!

213
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,499
Yes!
