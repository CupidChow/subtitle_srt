=The Ultimate Vow, Unknown to You=

10

=Episode 10=

11
00:01:26,425 --> 00:01:28,025
Back then, you

12
00:01:30,065 --> 00:01:31,504
though in a mess,

13
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:35,305
you were brighter

14
00:01:36,944 --> 00:01:38,585
than anyone else.

15
00:01:40,865 --> 00:01:42,424
At that time, you said

16
00:01:42,905 --> 00:01:44,820
a hundred years are but a dream.

17
00:01:45,744 --> 00:01:47,424
Looking back now,

18
00:01:49,184 --> 00:01:50,825
meeting you

19
00:01:54,065 --> 00:01:57,945
was my most beautiful dream.

20
00:01:59,304 --> 00:01:59,984
No!

21
00:02:00,824 --> 00:02:01,504
No!

22
00:02:01,985 --> 00:02:04,344
General!

23
00:02:18,105 --> 00:02:19,145
Ru,

24
00:02:20,225 --> 00:02:20,904
I...

25
00:02:26,304 --> 00:02:27,985
I can go back with you,

26
00:02:28,304 --> 00:02:29,745
but you must promise me

27
00:02:30,504 --> 00:02:32,185
to give Su Changji a proper burial.

28
00:02:32,584 --> 00:02:34,224
He is a great general

29
00:02:34,945 --> 00:02:36,865
and deserves this honor.

30
00:02:37,304 --> 00:02:37,944
Alright.

31
00:02:38,904 --> 00:02:39,944
I promise you.

32
00:03:59,985 --> 00:04:01,425
Your Highness, something's wrong.

33
00:04:01,945 --> 00:04:03,425
General Su's body is missing.

34
00:04:06,425 --> 00:04:07,185
What?

35
00:04:07,304 --> 00:04:08,504
The guards say

36
00:04:08,665 --> 00:04:10,185
black-clad men broke in that night.

37
00:04:20,425 --> 00:04:21,465
No!

38
00:04:22,304 --> 00:04:23,704
Take good care of her.

39
00:04:23,985 --> 00:04:25,624
Do not let anyone near.

40
00:04:25,824 --> 00:04:26,824
Yes.

41
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:28,263
Send people to investigate.

42
00:04:28,264 --> 00:04:29,064
Yes.

43
00:04:40,345 --> 00:04:41,944
A bunch of useless fools,

44
00:04:42,624 --> 00:04:44,345
can't even guard a dead body.

45
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:47,344
Your Highness, calm down.
I will send people to find him.

46
00:04:47,345 --> 00:04:49,183
We'll dig three feet deep if needed.

47
00:04:49,184 --> 00:04:50,064
Yes.

48
00:04:52,465 --> 00:04:54,384
Su Changji.

49
00:05:07,304 --> 00:05:08,785
Cloud iron armor?

50
00:05:08,824 --> 00:05:10,185
It was crafted by Western artisans,

51
00:05:10,304 --> 00:05:11,503
can block hidden weapons.

52
00:05:11,504 --> 00:05:12,944
Without it,

53
00:05:13,025 --> 00:05:15,064
the arrow would have pierced his heart.

54
00:05:15,184 --> 00:05:16,183
However,

55
00:05:16,184 --> 00:05:17,424
this arrow

56
00:05:17,425 --> 00:05:19,584
still injured his internal organs.

57
00:05:23,465 --> 00:05:24,464
General Su,

58
00:05:24,585 --> 00:05:25,785
you must not die.

59
00:05:26,304 --> 00:05:27,704
Cangzhou needs your aid.

60
00:05:29,824 --> 00:05:31,263
We must act quickly.

61
00:05:31,264 --> 00:05:32,344
Any delay

62
00:05:32,345 --> 00:05:33,905
may cost us dearly.

63
00:05:35,425 --> 00:05:36,545
Should we tell Young Lady

64
00:05:36,944 --> 00:05:38,383
about this matter?

65
00:05:38,384 --> 00:05:40,264
She just escaped the chaos

66
00:05:40,545 --> 00:05:41,985
and is living in peace.

67
00:05:42,944 --> 00:05:44,584
If we tell her,

68
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:46,745
wouldn't it drag her back
into the storm?

69
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:52,345
(Young Lady.)

70
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:54,425
(Forgive my presumption.)

71
00:06:17,865 --> 00:06:19,624
Your Ladyship, it's true.

72
00:06:19,665 --> 00:06:21,905
His Highness has brought
Young Lady Shen back.

73
00:06:22,785 --> 00:06:23,745
What?

74
00:06:27,425 --> 00:06:28,785
Take me to see her.

75
00:06:34,504 --> 00:06:35,704
Stop playing the victim.

76
00:06:36,384 --> 00:06:37,785
General Su's death

77
00:06:38,025 --> 00:06:39,704
should have pleased you.

78
00:06:40,462 --> 00:06:41,320
How?

79
00:06:42,304 --> 00:06:43,782
Your beloved is dead,

80
00:06:44,025 --> 00:06:45,745
and you can't even speak.

81
00:06:49,064 --> 00:06:49,865
Wretch!

82
00:06:50,025 --> 00:06:51,303
Don't think that by playing dumb,

83
00:06:51,304 --> 00:06:52,584
then His Highness will pity you.

84
00:06:52,585 --> 00:06:53,745
I'll tell you.

85
00:06:54,545 --> 00:06:57,425
His Highness' birthday banquet
is in three days.

86
00:06:58,105 --> 00:07:00,824
Someone like you,
unlucky after your husband's death,

87
00:07:01,465 --> 00:07:03,225
shouldn't show up.

88
00:07:06,144 --> 00:07:07,185
Yes.

89
00:07:09,112 --> 00:07:10,407
You're right.

90
00:07:12,275 --> 00:07:14,395
I am indeed an unlucky person.

91
00:07:14,585 --> 00:07:15,905
What do you mean by that?

92
00:07:19,384 --> 00:07:21,225
Birthday banquet.

93
00:07:33,144 --> 00:07:34,425
Add more honey.

94
00:07:34,944 --> 00:07:36,545
His Highness likes sweets.

95
00:07:38,865 --> 00:07:39,584
What's going on?

96
00:07:39,744 --> 00:07:42,823
Shen Qingru brought the rice wine

97
00:07:42,824 --> 00:07:45,704
as a gift for His Highness' birthday.

98
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,984
(Three years ago)

99
00:08:03,985 --> 00:08:05,344
If you drink too much,

100
00:08:05,345 --> 00:08:07,985
don't blame me for the strong brew.

101
00:08:09,704 --> 00:08:12,185
Seeing you already made me drunk.

102
00:08:15,064 --> 00:08:16,185
Talkative.

103
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:52,625
Your Highness, no!

104
00:08:52,945 --> 00:08:54,265
There's poison in this wine.

105
00:08:59,504 --> 00:09:00,984
If she wanted to kill me,

106
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:04,425
why use poison?

107
00:09:05,065 --> 00:09:06,064
Wretch!

108
00:09:06,305 --> 00:09:08,425
What spell did you put on His Highness?

109
00:09:08,585 --> 00:09:09,305
Ru,

110
00:09:09,624 --> 00:09:11,425
if you are determined to kill me,

111
00:09:13,065 --> 00:09:13,744
then...

112
00:09:17,264 --> 00:09:19,425
- Guards, take this wretch away!
- Shut up!

113
00:09:19,784 --> 00:09:20,545
Get lost!

114
00:09:30,225 --> 00:09:31,505
Do you think

115
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:33,905
you can trap my heart this way?

116
00:09:37,024 --> 00:09:38,665
If I can't have you,

117
00:09:39,504 --> 00:09:41,064
I will imprison you for life.

118
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,743
(Jinhua Hall)

119
00:09:50,744 --> 00:09:51,464
(Young Lady.)

120
00:09:51,544 --> 00:09:53,704
(I must take you away from this chaos.)

121
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:57,845
(Jinhua Hall)

122
00:09:58,345 --> 00:09:59,263
Bold assassins,

123
00:09:59,264 --> 00:10:00,665
surrender now!

124
00:10:01,305 --> 00:10:02,344
With just you?

125
00:10:03,865 --> 00:10:04,824
Miss Cui,

126
00:10:05,065 --> 00:10:06,265
His Highness requests you.

127
00:10:11,185 --> 00:10:13,232
Yuwen Que, you set a trap for me.

128
00:10:17,865 --> 00:10:19,070
I

129
00:10:19,504 --> 00:10:21,557
just want to ask Miss Cui
a few questions.

130
00:10:21,945 --> 00:10:24,470
I won't tell you anything
about Young Lady.

131
00:10:24,664 --> 00:10:25,595
Is that so?

132
00:10:26,904 --> 00:10:28,745
But I heard

133
00:10:29,024 --> 00:10:31,344
you and Shen Qingru grew up together,

134
00:10:32,144 --> 00:10:33,482
and were very close.

135
00:10:33,544 --> 00:10:35,824
Are you really afraid
of anyone near her?

136
00:10:36,544 --> 00:10:37,905
You can't imprison her.

137
00:10:38,024 --> 00:10:40,064
Her heart will never belong to you.

138
00:10:47,744 --> 00:10:49,145
Send Miss Cui back to her residence.

139
00:10:49,744 --> 00:10:50,584
Remember,

140
00:10:51,024 --> 00:10:52,383
take good care of her.

141
00:10:52,384 --> 00:10:53,185
Yes.

142
00:10:53,544 --> 00:10:55,064
Yuwen Que, if you dare harm Young Lady,

143
00:10:55,065 --> 00:10:56,744
I will never forgive you in this life.

144
00:11:09,225 --> 00:11:10,344
Qingru,

145
00:11:10,945 --> 00:11:13,064
if you knew what I've done for you,

146
00:11:14,865 --> 00:11:16,104
would you hate me?

147
00:11:22,624 --> 00:11:24,145
This jade pendant

148
00:11:27,384 --> 00:11:29,107
belongs to Cui Di.

149
00:11:32,185 --> 00:11:34,185
How long will you keep killing?

150
00:11:35,225 --> 00:11:37,785
Do you have to kill everyone around me

151
00:11:38,624 --> 00:11:40,025
before you stop?

152
00:11:53,784 --> 00:11:54,584
No!
