00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,440
[Name: Ni Xiangdong]

00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,590
[He feels the silence pent up inside him]

4
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,150
[roaring and screaming, deafeningly loud.]

[Episode 8: Living on Borrowed Time]

6
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,360
I'll carry it myself.

7
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:06,470
[Police]

8
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:06,870
Here.

9
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,730
What's this?

10
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,080
I bought it at the town market.

11
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,140
A coconut carving.

12
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,890
Why didn't you give it to me
on the way here?

13
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,070
I was afraid people would see

14
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:17,750
and gossip,

15
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:19,290
saying that Weihai Police

16
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,180
don't do real work

17
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,360
and use public funds to date.

18
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,720
You're really something.

19
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,050
Dating on public funds?

20
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,720
Have you no shame?

21
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:28,530
I spent money

22
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,830
on the gift I gave you.

23
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,920
You can't talk to me like that.

24
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,430
What did you give me?

25
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:33,040
A turtle?

26
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,520
Implying I work too slow?

27
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,400
I...

28
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,310
I meant...

29
00:04:37,159 --> 00:04:37,750
What?

30
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,270
I meant to wish you a long life—

31
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,600
may you live 1000 years.

32
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,210
Well, thank you so much.

33
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:50,360
On this mountain,

34
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:52,159
all the graves are earth burials, right?

35
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:52,680
Yes.

36
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,430
In the old days,
most villagers who died tragically

37
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:55,800
or took their own lives

38
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,420
couldn't be buried
in the ancestral mountain.

39
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,480
You can open the coffin now, sir.

40
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,800
Good luck with the opening.

41
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,000
Tong Hao.

42
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:34,900
Come here.

43
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:36,159
Take off my watch.

44
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,610
Walk around me once.

45
00:05:45,159 --> 00:05:46,090
Put it back on me.

46
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:46,760
Look.

47
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:47,580
See?

48
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,190
The watch crown?

49
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:49,590
Right.

50
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:50,550
Normally,

51
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,630
when you wear a watch, the crown

52
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:52,830
should point to your hand,

53
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:53,830
not your arm, right?

54
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:54,310
See?

55
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,070
If he put it on wrong before going out,

56
00:05:58,070 --> 00:05:58,600
he couldn't have

57
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,450
gone all day without noticing.

58
00:05:59,450 --> 00:05:59,980
Exactly.

59
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,130
Can you tell

60
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,870
the cause and time of death?

61
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,970
If it was pathological

62
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,560
or from external injury,

63
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:09,270
given the condition of the body,

64
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,870
the cause would be hard to determine.

65
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,330
But if it was from a strong

66
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,360
external impact

67
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:14,970
causing bone damage

68
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,360
or poisoning,

69
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:18,110
then it's possible.

70
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,000
But the most important thing now

71
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,120
is to confirm the identity of the body.

72
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,160
Then compare it with

73
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:23,980
Xu Caizeng.

74
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,190
And Tong Hao and I

75
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,270
will head back to the city now

76
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,950
to retrieve

77
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,800
the files of Xu Qingli's case back then.

78
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,680
We'll be going then.

79
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,480
-Xu.
-Okay.

80
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,470
Thanks for your hard work.

81
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:32,750
Bye.

82
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:33,370
Take care.

83
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,040
Bye, Ms. Xia.

84
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,440
We won't see you off then.

85
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:36,460
We're leaving.

86
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:43,570
What are you doing?

87
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:44,970
What's going on

88
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:45,900
between you two?

89
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,190
Who?

90
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:48,310
Me and Xia Jie?

91
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:52,870
Did you hear anything?

92
00:06:53,659 --> 00:06:55,520
I'm just asking out of curiosity.

93
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:56,840
Well,

94
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:57,680
we...

95
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,230
First of all, Ms. Xia

96
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,180
is definitely a good person.

97
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,240
So you're not a good person?

98
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,600
I'm a good person too.

99
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,430
Here's how it is.

100
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:08,110
We grew up together.

101
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,630
Then in college,

102
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:10,630
we went to the same university,

103
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,830
so we started dating.

104
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:13,680
Back then,
we didn't think too much about it.

105
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,310
You know?

106
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,360
We were both focused

107
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,430
on our little dreams,

108
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:18,630
doing our own things.

109
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,730
Understand?

110
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,680
No, I don't.

111
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,560
Have you ever been in a relationship?

112
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,000
Yes.

113
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,000
Let me tell you,

114
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,430
dating and marriage are different.

115
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:29,000
After marriage,

116
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,390
all sorts of issues came up.

117
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:31,800
At that time,
there were a lot of things going on at home,

118
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,630
and a lot of work stuff as well.

119
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:33,480
You know

120
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,190
our line of work.

121
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:34,650
And then

122
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,170
I told her,

123
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:36,060
"You stay home.

124
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:36,920
Our family needs you."

125
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,720
She said, "You stay home.

126
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,600
Our family needs you."

127
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,240
I said, "That won't work.

128
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:39,750
I need to work."

129
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,390
She said, "That won't work.

130
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,450
I need to work too."

131
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,780
So we divorced.

132
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,480
Got it?

133
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,159
Not really.

134
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,800
You're so stupid.

135
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:52,120
Thanks.

136
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,070
Thanks.

137
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,310
Don't bring this up with anyone
when you go back,

138
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:56,680
okay?

139
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:57,190
Okay.

140
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:16,870
Uncle Xu.

141
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:19,250
We've reviewed those case files.

142
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,160
Legally, there's no loophole.

143
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,950
But after the suspect Xu Qingli

144
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:23,560
died,

145
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:24,960
the case was suspended.

146
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,040
I know what's written in the files

147
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:28,100
better than you do.

148
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,040
I can recite it by heart.

149
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:32,429
The evidence in the files

150
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:34,530
has already formed a closed loop.

151
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:35,909
Once the loop is formed,

152
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:36,880
any

153
00:08:36,909 --> 00:08:38,480
suspicious points

154
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,630
find it very hard to fit in.

155
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,320
By the way,

156
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,360
back then,

157
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,030
Bao Desheng

158
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:45,230
was lying right here.

159
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,290
Xu.

160
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:49,720
Were there

161
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:51,970
any other suspicious points at the scene?

162
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:52,900
You could say so.

163
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,140
But those

164
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,510
hardly count as evidence,

165
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:55,960
so they weren't

166
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,470
recorded in the files.

167
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,000
Xu Qingli's case

168
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,210
definitely started with Bao Desheng.

169
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,720
He had the motive.

170
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:04,360
But

171
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,900
why did Bao Desheng

172
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:06,960
suddenly appear here

173
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,720
out of nowhere?

174
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:08,440
Who brought him here?

175
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,500
How did he get here?

176
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,480
Xu Qingli's place

177
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,720
is extremely far from here.

178
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,390
If he really was the murderer,

179
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,920
how did he travel back and forth?

180
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,320
I remember

181
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:19,270
the case files didn't mention

182
00:09:19,270 --> 00:09:21,130
anything about transportation.

183
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,960
On the night Bao Desheng died,

184
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,030
less than a kilometer west of here,

185
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:26,790
in a small village,

186
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:28,270
there was a traffic accident.

187
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:30,210
I was just about to go to bed

188
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,880
when I suddenly heard
a loud crash outside.

189
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,690
All the plastic barrels
in front of my house

190
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:36,380
were knocked over.

191
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,430
Look.

192
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:39,670
A man

193
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:42,200
on a motorcycle

194
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,340
fell over by the barrels.

195
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:48,490
It was quite a bad fall.

196
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,680
When he got up to lift the motorcycle,

197
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:52,210
I saw there was a large patch

198
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,320
of blood on him.

199
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,390
I don't know

200
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,680
if it was from the fall

201
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,910
or something else.

202
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,240
Before I could react,

203
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,370
he got on the motorcycle and rode away.

204
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:01,400
Xu.

205
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,170
We just received a report.

206
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,300
A male body was found

207
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,110
near the old bridge wasteland.

208
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:32,680
What model was the motorcycle?

209
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,040
A standard motorcycle.

210
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,790
That's another strange point.

211
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:42,720
Afterwards,

212
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,060
I visited Xu Qingli's coworkers.

213
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:46,480
First,

214
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,230
this guy didn't have a motorcycle;

215
00:10:49,390 --> 00:10:50,000
second,

216
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,490
he didn't know
how to ride a standard motorcycle.

217
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,550
This case is fundamentally flawed.

218
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,080
They say it was a crime of passion

219
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,280
over a relationship.

220
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,200
But the files

221
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:06,120
describe it as a typical case
of killing for profit.

222
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:06,510
Yes.

223
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:09,390
Not only

224
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,270
were the watch and gold necklace

225
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:11,930
on him gone,

226
00:11:12,790 --> 00:11:14,050
but also a leather bag.

227
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,670
That bag contained

228
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:18,330
the gift money Bao Desheng had collected

229
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:18,860
that day.

230
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:20,610
It was gone too.

231
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,360
Latre,

232
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:23,310
the task force

233
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,120
searched every place in Jialin City

234
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,850
that could fence stolen goods—

235
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,320
antique shops,

236
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:28,670
pawnshops,

237
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,120
legal and illegal,

238
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:30,960
underground and legitimate—

239
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,870
but found

240
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,120
no trace

241
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,330
of the stolen items.

242
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:36,970
Uncle Xu,

243
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,440
do you think the real killer

244
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:40,720
is someone else?

245
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,240
Although

246
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,000
there were testimonies,

247
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:48,750
there was no evidence proving

248
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,280
Xu Qingli was the murderer.

249
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,150
Even if

250
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,420
it is someone else,

251
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,150
I have no proof.

252
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,840
After all,
everyone is innocent until proven guilty.

253
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,030
When Xu Qingli died,

254
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,780
our only suspect was gone too.

255
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:07,810
The evidence chain lacked eyewitnesses

256
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:09,270
and crucial statements,

257
00:12:10,030 --> 00:12:11,490
so the case was suspended.

258
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:13,940
But suspension doesn't mean
the case is closed.

259
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,390
If the evidence chain is incomplete,

260
00:12:15,390 --> 00:12:17,650
the truth will always be missing a piece.

261
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,360
So I...

262
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:23,820
Why am I telling you all this?

263
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,060
It's about time.

264
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,510

274
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,850
I'll send you there.

Alright, Captain Ma.

276
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,430
I'll tell my mentor right away.

278
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,000
What is it?

279
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,070
There's a new lead on Ni Xiangdong's

280
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:17,070

281
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:17,580
Chu Xiao

282
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,960
found the post office stub.

283
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,000
They compared the handwriting

284
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,570
and confirmed
they were all sent by the same person.

285
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:22,600
The money was sent to several cities,

286
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,270
each one farther north

287
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,470
along the coastline.

288
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,360
Each one farther north?

289
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:25,750
Yes.

290
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:26,730
They said

291
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,240
it stopped at Weihai.

292
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:29,200
Mentor,

293
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,510
isn't this too much of a coincidence?

294
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,390
Wu Ximei also said

295
00:13:32,390 --> 00:13:33,960
he was heading straight north.

296
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,670
Normally,
people from Nanyang who go out to work

297
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:37,670
first choose the Pearl River Delta,

298
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:38,880
because it's close.

299
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:39,670
If they go further north,

300
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:41,670
it would be the Yangtze River Delta.

301
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:45,530
So why did they come to Weihai?

302
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,440
There's not a single reason

303
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,550
for them to settle

304
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:50,690
and work in Weihai.

305
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,440
None.

306
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,090
I don't understand.

307
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:54,870

308

309
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:59,250
This behavior is indeed strange.

310
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,570
It seems off.

311
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:01,870
If we can figure out

312
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,000
why they came to Weihai,

313
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,660
we might find a breakthrough.

00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:28,960
I even went to the police.

386
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,350
The police said
it's the Labor Bureau's job.

387
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:31,000
I went to the Labor Bureau;

388
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,050
they said without contracts,

389
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:32,920
we're working illegally.

390
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,450
Where can we go to complain?

391
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:37,750
So what do we do?

392
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,510
I just saw that

393
00:21:47,110 --> 00:21:49,710
there was only an old man
at the security booth.

394
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,280
What do you mean?

395
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,440
What do you think?

396
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:53,880
This bundle of wire

397
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,740
could sell for hundreds outside.

398
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:57,790
You want to steal it?

399
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,030
It's only stealing if you get caught.

400
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,690
Otherwise, it's just taking.

401
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,290
What's wrong with you?

402
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,270
What if...

403
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:06,940
someone sees us?

404
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:07,960
See us?

405
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:08,790
You're such a coward.

406
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:09,750
If you're that timid,

407
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,610
today's work will be for nothing.

408
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:12,590
Here's the plan:

409
00:22:12,590 --> 00:22:14,270
you just need to keep an eye
on the old man,

410
00:22:14,270 --> 00:22:15,030
and I'll go get it.

411
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:15,550
Deal?

412
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,510
If it works out,

413
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:18,370
I'll give you 30% of the earnings.

414
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,970
Thief!

415
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,510
Thief!

416
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:13,140
Let go!

417
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,130
Let go now!

418
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,550
Let go!

419
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,170
Let go!

420
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,240
Let go!

421
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,510
I said let go!

422
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:20,390
Are you crazy?

423
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,880
Don't shout!

424
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,630
I'll strangle you if you shout.

425
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,480
Stop yelling.

426
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:27,970
Are you insane?

427
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,240
What if you

428
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:29,880
had smothered him to death?

429
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,960
You idiot.

430
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:32,630
Don't shout.

431
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,450
Keep quiet.

I'm not taking your food.

443
00:26:27,790 --> 00:26:28,590
Eat.

444
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:31,240
There's beer?

445
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,440
You stole it, right?

446
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:34,680
In the future,

447
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,140
you should steal less.

448
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,510
If you get caught

449
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:39,830

What?

452
00:26:58,310 --> 00:27:00,110
Today is my birthday.

453
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:01,830
Your birthday?

454
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:04,830
Good.

465

00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:41,170
No, thanks.

470
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:42,810
Come on.

471
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,530
Isn't it your birthday?

472
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,540
For your birthday.

473
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,170
It's him?

Yes.

on my turf?

476
00:28:49,790 --> 00:28:50,440
No.

477
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,750
I didn't cause any trouble.

478
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:52,750
You didn't?

479
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:55,400
Look. He's missing teeth.

480
00:28:56,070 --> 00:28:57,750
It wasn't me.

481
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:58,960
It wasn't you?

482
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,320
You don't look like
you have money to pay us.

483
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,250
Will you kowtow willingly,

484
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,920
or do we have to force you?

485
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:08,920
I really didn't mean to.

486
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:10,750
I'm sorry.

487
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,310
I'm sorry, okay?

488
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:16,310

489
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,400
But you're just a coward.

490
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,550
Beat him!

491
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,300

492
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:27,680
It's fine. It's not a big deal.

493
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:31,350
Once you take the money,
you're obligated to do the job properly.

494
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:32,120
Get lost!

495
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:35,050

00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:55,920
Forget it.

00:29:56,070 --> 00:29:56,960
-Don't stop me!
-Stop!

508
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,420
I'm going to knock out
one of his teeth today!

509
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,790
Don't run!

510
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:28,310
Call for help!

511
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:30,560

00:33:05,270 --> 00:33:06,590
Just finish today's work.

575
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:07,250
No problem.

576
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,200
Alright.

577
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:08,750
Thank you, Tian.

578
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:09,350
It's okay.

579
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:10,690
Ni.

580
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,440
You're a good person.

581
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:16,070
You're reliable,

582
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:18,000
honest,

583
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:19,530
and you work efficiently.

584
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,680
Well...

585
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:23,790
It's not much.

586
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:24,590
No need, Tian.

587
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:24,950
What are you doing?

588
00:33:24,950 --> 00:33:26,000
It's just a little something from me.

589
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:26,880
-Take it.
-No need.

590
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,720
Take it.

591
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:29,320
Listen to me.

592
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,640
Let me tell you,

593
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,070
a man with money has it easy,

594
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:33,160
and a man without it struggles.

595
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:34,690
No one has it easy out there.

596
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,320
We all have difficult times.

597
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:38,720
When you make something of yourself
in the future,

598
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,120
you can help others then.

599
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:41,520
Thank you, Tian.

600
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:43,040
I'm leaving.

601
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:45,050
Take care of yourself.

602
00:33:57,390 --> 00:33:58,240
Give me the glue.

603
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,700
Spread a little over here.

604
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:00,650
Is that enough?

605
00:34:01,050 --> 00:34:01,510
[Old Days]

606
00:34:01,510 --> 00:34:02,310
There's a gap.

607
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:03,350
A tiny bit here.

608
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,440
Go north.

609
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:07,210
You're used to the sound of waves.

610
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:08,770
Find a city by the sea.

611
00:34:09,670 --> 00:34:10,929
Listening to the waves

612
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:13,199
will help you sleep better.

613
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:16,030
Excuse me.

614
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,880
Does this lighthouse really exist?

615
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,510
Yes.

616
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,659
It's in Weihai.

617
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:25,110
Weihai.

618
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,360
Come.

619
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:37,400
Here.

620
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:38,580
Put it here.

621
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:39,280
Here.

622
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:39,920
Here?

623
00:34:40,110 --> 00:34:40,510
Yes.

624
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,320
Excuse me.

625
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,730
What place is this painting of?

626
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:02,350
Wenping Lighthouse.

627
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,620
It looks a lot like the sea
in my hometown,

628
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,360
but not exactly the same.

629
00:35:15,110 --> 00:35:16,440
The sea in my hometown is

630
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,340
golden and bright.

631
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:21,670
The sand there is very fine

632
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,110
and soft.

633
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:29,400
Excuse me.

634
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:31,840
Do you have any

635
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,370
extra copies of that photo?

636
00:36:34,550 --> 00:36:35,410
That's enough.

637
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:37,240
Bless us with safety and peace.

638
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:45,550
Alright.

639
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:47,590
Ms. Li.

640
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:49,400
What?

641
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:50,590
Auntie.

642
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,670
Have you seen Wu Ximei these days?

643
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:54,110
Who?

644
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:54,960
Wu Ximei.

645
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,300
The girl lives on the third floor.

646
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,630
I haven't paid attention.

647
00:36:58,630 --> 00:36:59,280
Granny,

648
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,920
it's not a holiday or festival.

649
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:02,050
Why are you praying?

650
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,210
Well, recently,

651
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:04,070
I feel our

652
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:05,920
neighborhood isn't very safe.

653
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:07,070
Right?

654
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:08,590
Look, first it was Li Qingfu

655
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:09,590
from Qu's family,

656
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,360
right?

657
00:37:10,630 --> 00:37:12,690
And my granddaughter is still young.

658
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,590
So,

659
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:15,530
what if something happens to her?

660
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,630
That's why I'm praying for safety.

661
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:18,740
That day,

662
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:19,580
she told me

663
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:21,890
that when she got up to go
to the bathroom…

664
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,560
It's nothing.

665
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,980
What-what happened, Auntie?

666
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:28,270
And then?

667
00:37:28,670 --> 00:37:29,360
Nothing.

668
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:30,230
Nothing.

669
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:31,030
Just tell us.

670
00:37:31,070 --> 00:37:32,070
It's okay, ma'am.

671
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:32,550
It's...

672
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:33,390
useless.

673
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,400
Don't believe

674
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:35,390
what kids say.

675
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,290
We're police officers.

676
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,730
Tell us

677
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,880
if you have any

678
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,320
reliable information.

679
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,580
If the case gets solved

680
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:42,360
and the bad guys are caught,

681
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,760
won't this place be safe?

682
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:44,740
She said that

683
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:47,440
when she got up
to go to the bathroom at night,

684
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,280
she saw our neighbor,

685
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,850
Cao Xiaojun.

686
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:56,810
Come in, please.

687
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,170
Take a look at our little house.

688
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:00,880
Look.

689
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,190
It's a small place.

690
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,510
Lele.

691
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,590
Why haven't you taken your medicine?

692
00:38:07,590 --> 00:38:09,190
Grandma, I'm all better now.

693
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:11,960
Come in, please.

694
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:12,800
Should we

695
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,630
change our shoes?

696
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:14,530
No need.

697
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,020
No need.

698
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,410
Please, have a seat.

699
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:17,880
My son

700
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:20,160
and his wife live in the inner room.

701
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,480
Lele and I sleep here.

702
00:38:22,590 --> 00:38:23,320
That's nice.

703
00:38:23,550 --> 00:38:24,590
My son

704
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,520
drives a taxi with a partner.

705
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:28,150
He often works night shifts.

706
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:28,920
His wife

707
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,490
works at a biscuit factory.

708
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:32,150
It's a three-shift rotation.

709
00:38:32,150 --> 00:38:33,320
So most of the time,

710
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,630
it's just

711
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:36,510
my granddaughter and me at home.

712
00:38:37,110 --> 00:38:37,710
Lele,

713
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:38,960
I heard

714
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:39,880
from your grandma

715
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,680
that you were sick a few days ago.

716
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:42,700
It's fine.

717
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,440
Mom and Grandma

718
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:46,920
said I had a fever.

719
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:49,230
They said I caught a chill.

720
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,230
Which day did you catch a chill?

721
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,340
The day before yesterday.

722
00:38:55,110 --> 00:38:57,320
Was it the day before yesterday
or the one before that?

723
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,320
Think carefully.

724
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,630
It was the day I went to school.

725
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,760
That night, when I was going to bed,

726
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:06,840
I needed to pee,

727
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,320
and then

728
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,440
I heard a noise outside the door.

729
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:20,210
So I looked outside through the peephole.

730
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,210
What did you see?

731
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,630
I saw Uncle Cao

732
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:30,360
coming out of his apartment.

733
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:34,070
And then?

734
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:36,800
That's all.

735
00:39:37,070 --> 00:39:38,400
I went back to sleep.

736
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:39,630
Are you sure the person you saw

737
00:39:39,630 --> 00:39:40,590
was Uncle Cao?

738
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:41,630
Lele.

739
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,320
Think carefully.

740
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:45,840
The man you saw

741
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:46,510
through the peephole—

742
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:48,360
did he have a scar here?

743
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,110
The one with the scar is Uncle Ni.

744
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:51,510
Uncle Cao doesn't have one.
