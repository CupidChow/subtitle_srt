00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:29,280
you don't work for him anymore.

384
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,070
If Mr. Dao doesn't approve,

385
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32,030
I can't leave.

386
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,680
I can't afford to cross him.

387
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,550
Everything will work out in the end.

388
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:37,350
We'll deal with whatever comes.

389
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:38,040
At worst,

390
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,810
you can hang with us two.

391
00:21:40,030 --> 00:21:41,000
You two?

392
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:42,680
Looks like you've got this meal,

393
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:44,280
but nothing for the next one.

394
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:48,440
Ximei.

395
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:50,920
I'm Ni Xiangdong.

396
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,720
With this face

397
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,790
and my name alone,

398
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:56,270
there's no restaurant

399
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:57,270
on Huayuan Street

400
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:59,710
that wouldn't let me
eat and sit as I please.

401
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:01,960
Don't laugh. Am I right?

402
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:03,030
Yes.

403
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,370
That Mr. Dao

404
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,520
is just a pimp.

405
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:07,680
What's the big deal?

406
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:09,170
If you're uncomfortable talking to him,

407
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:10,430
I'll help you solve it.

408
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:12,480
I'll go find that Mr. Dao tomorrow.

[May wealth and prosperity flow in]

411
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:52,720
Mr. Dao.

412
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:54,400
I'm sorry.

413
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,750
This time it's my fault.

414
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,440
Just name your price.

415
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:00,910
I'll try my best to get it.

416
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,560
How much can you come up with?

417
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:10,280
Is this something money can solve?

418
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:11,400
Mr. Dao.

419
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,060
You're straightforward too.

420
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:17,530
So what do you suggest?

421
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,420
Are these two also from Baorong Village?

422
00:23:21,790 --> 00:23:23,240
I just met them.

423
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,730
She's under my protection.

424
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:33,780
Talk to me if there's any problem.

425
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:36,680
Who's backing you?

426
00:23:37,030 --> 00:23:38,760
Which boss are you working for?

427
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,000
I work for Dong.

428
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,160
Are you Dong?

429
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:49,110
Me.

430
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,160
Ni Xiangdong.

431
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,640
You think you're tough, huh?

432
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,240
Cheng.

433
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:58,440
Let's be clear about this.

434
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,750
This isn't about money.

435
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:02,480
It's about face.

436
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,480
Tell me.

437
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:05,070
What should we do?

438
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,200
Two of those troublemakers

439
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,730
from the other day got away.

440
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,320
I know where they are now.

441
00:24:11,270 --> 00:24:12,750
I'm leaving these two people

442
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,080
for you to handle, Dong.

443
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:17,070
Fine.

444
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:19,550
For my shop

445
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,550
to be renovated,

446
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:23,920
it'll cost about...

447
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:28,870
This much.

448
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,200
That bigger guy,

449
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:33,350
one finger, 10,000 yuan.

450
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:34,030
Okay.

451
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,750
If I bring you

452
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:40,950
one more finger,

453
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,680
does it count as an extra 10,000, right?

454
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,550
I want the 21st one.

455
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:56,640
Don't worry.

456
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,640
We'll handle it for you.

457
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,920
Take the cigarettes.

458
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:08,920
Come back.

459
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,740
Close the door.

460
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:13,880
Sit down.

461
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,880
Everyone

462
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:28,000
calls me Mr. Dao.

463
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,030
Do you know my full name?

464
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,160
Wu

465
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:33,880
Zheng

466
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:34,640
dao.

467
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:38,480
Sounds like "no right path." Is
there any right path left in this world?

468
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,030
Is there?

469
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,070
Yes, there is.

470
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,270
It just depends if your feet

471
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:45,640
will walk that path.

472
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,200
I've always had high hopes for you.

473
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,500
Make sure you master hair washing

474
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:54,590
and haircutting.

475
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,880
After half a year,

476
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,240
I'll open a shop for you,

477
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:58,730
and you'll be the manager.

478
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,680
If you really don't want to

479
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,480
work under me,

480
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:01,680
you can rent your own shop

481
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,550
and have a stable,

482
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:03,410
peaceful life.

483
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:04,680
Isn't that good?

484
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,270
Wu Ximei.

485
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:08,640
I'm asking you seriously.

486
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:11,960
Do you want to continue

487
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,160
working here?

488
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:15,640
What we fear

489
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,080
is not having no choice,

490
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:19,550
but choosing wrong.

491
00:26:20,750 --> 00:26:21,790
One wrong choice

492
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:24,760
brings a lifetime of hardship.

493
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,550
Two options

494
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,480
are in front of you.

495
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:30,510
How to choose?

496
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,240
Figure it out yourself.

497
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:35,480
Mr. Dao.

498
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:37,840
I'll stay and work here.

499
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,350
Once the shop is fixed up,

500
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:42,800
I'll train two more

501
00:26:42,830 --> 00:26:44,090
skilled hair washers.

502
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:46,000
We're like family.

503
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:48,920
Let's be honest.

504
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:51,240
In the future,

505
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,400
do you still plan

506
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,690
to hang around with

507
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,180
those two troublemakers?

508
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:02,790
Let me be honest with you too.

509
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:05,270
That boy with

510
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:07,160
the scar by his eye

511
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,350
won't last long.

512
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:29,950
I'll take the stronger one

513
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,600
and you handle the other one.

514
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,590
Once we're inside,

515
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:33,590
we'll improvise.

516
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:54,880
You two!

517
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:56,790
Guys,

518
00:27:56,850 --> 00:27:57,910
grab your weapons!

519
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:47,960
Are you guys

520
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,350
alright?

521
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:51,370
What happened?

522
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:53,400
Don't worry.

523
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:55,640
I've taken care of it for you.

524
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,030
Cheng.

525
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:29,360
Take this to feed Bench.

526
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,150
Which one of you cut this?

527
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,550
I did.

528
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:39,110
Not bad.

529
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,270
You've got guts.

530
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,010
Didn't you say there were only two people?

531
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,350
Were you trying to get us killed?

532
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:46,960
Yes.

533
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:48,590
But you two

534
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:50,390
came back just fine, didn't you?

535
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:55,920
That's true.

536
00:29:59,750 --> 00:30:01,030
So this matter...

537
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:03,240
We're even now.

538
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:05,510
What about Ximei?

539
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:07,790
Ximei

540
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:09,560
said herself

541
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,830
she wants to stay and work for me.

542
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:16,000
From now on, we're family.

543
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:17,910
No distinctions between us.

544
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,960
Tomorrow night,

545
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,590
it's the same group.

546
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:24,510
I need to put

547
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:25,720
an end to this matter.

548
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:28,070
You two come with me

549
00:30:28,830 --> 00:30:29,920
to keep watch.

550
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:32,720
How do we watch?

551
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:34,680
It's simple.

552
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:40,310
If police come, shout a warning.

553
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,300
If enemies come, finish them off.

554
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,550
Dong.

555
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:32,370
Master Five.

556
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:36,640
Sorry for making you come all this way.

557
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:49,440
Where are you going?

558
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,200
They've made their move.

559
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,460
None of your business.

560
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:52,450
Are you stupid?

561
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:53,220
Don't you remember how they messed with us

562
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:53,990
before?

563
00:31:54,270 --> 00:31:54,940
Come back!

564
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,510
There are more people upstairs.

565
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:00,240
Follow me up.

566
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:01,680
Run!

567
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,590
How is it?

568
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:19,230
Ximei.

569
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,200
Mr. Dao was at the old bridge

570
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,550
and was stabbed to death
by those guys just now.

571
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:22,550
They'll be coming after us soon.

572
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:23,280
Leave now.

573
00:32:23,310 --> 00:32:24,200
It's not safe here.
