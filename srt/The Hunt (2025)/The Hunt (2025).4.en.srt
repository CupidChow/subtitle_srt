209

This time, it's just pig's feet.

221

Next time, I'll transport something else
and make more money.

222

Anyway, this business is dangerous.

and getting by.

572
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:02,440
We just want to survive.

573
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:05,710
If things were so good with Ni Xiangdong,

574
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:06,280
why did you

575
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:07,630
end up with Cao Xiaojun

576
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:09,650
and even marry him?

577
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:13,550
Even the sweetest candy

578
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,520
will eventually turn bitter

579
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:18,890
if overcooked.

580
00:38:40,550 --> 00:38:42,010
Close that door properly.

581
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,680
The light is making it hard to see the TV.

582
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:19,320
I'm going out for a while.

583
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,070
Don't wait up for me tonight.

584
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:21,270
I might not come back.

585
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:22,280
Where are you going?

586
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,320
Dinner is ready.

587
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,080
I'm going out.

588
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:26,280
A friend needs to see me.

589
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,280
You're going to see
the person surnamed Liang again?

590
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:29,840
When did I say that?

591
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:31,760
A friend of mine needs to see me.

592
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,760
You've gambled away your motorbike.

593
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,900
They lent you money to gamble.

594
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,150
It's obviously a trap.

595
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:36,920
Are you stupid?

596
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,230
And you're walking right into it!

597
00:39:38,230 --> 00:39:39,480
When did I gamble?

598
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:41,320
I'm going out to make money!

599
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,710
Who's going to support you
if I don't make money?

600
00:39:42,710 --> 00:39:43,800
You're not going!

601
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:45,280
Stupid!

602
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:47,250
Don't go!

603
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,000
Can you just stay put for one day?

604
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,400
What are you trying to do?

605
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:51,880
I need to go out for a bit!

606
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:52,710
Yet you won't let me!

607
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:53,240
My period

608
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,590
is late.

609
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:56,000
What's late?

610
00:39:58,230 --> 00:40:00,630
I thought I couldn't get pregnant anymore.

611
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:08,880
Uncle Chen has been arrested.

612
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,230
One after another.

613
00:40:11,030 --> 00:40:12,030
It never ends.

614
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,640
How will we raise our child if it's born?

615
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,330
It's not the right time.

616
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,280
Well, tomorrow morning,

617
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,800
I'll come and take you

618
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,880
to the clinic

619
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:23,090
to get an abortion.

620
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:29,920
Ximei, are you okay?

621
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,760
You shouldn't smoke.

622
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,730
I'm having an abortion anyway.

623
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:52,770
It doesn't matter.

624
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,230
Uncle Chen once said

625
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,280
I had been through too much,

626
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,080
and my body had long been ruined.

627
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,110
This might be

628
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:23,360
my last child.

629
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,960
If you really want this baby,

630
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,190
keep it.

631
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:47,630
He said...

632
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:49,480
Never mind him.

633
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,400
It's your body.

634
00:43:56,510 --> 00:43:57,640
It's your decision.

635
00:43:58,630 --> 00:43:59,920
I'm just a woman,

636
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,770
with little education.

637
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:04,400
I can't earn much money.

638
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,260
How can I raise a child?

639
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:19,860
If the baby is born,

640
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:21,920
I'll raise it.
