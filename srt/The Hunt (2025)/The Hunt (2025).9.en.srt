00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:22,880
No, I don't.

387
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:24,300
You don't know?

388
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:26,730
Are you short on money lately?

389
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,000
What are you looking at?

390
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,030
I'm just asking.

391
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:30,920
Let me tell you.

392
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,180
You better be careful.

393
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,780
Did you hear me?

394
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:34,960
Ms. Dou.

395
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,640
One serving of fried pancake.

396
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,640
One fried pancake.
Would you like an egg with it?

397
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,070
No egg.

398
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:50,010
Wang Cheng told me

399
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:52,160
that you're also from Nanyang.

400
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:53,000
Yes.

401
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:55,240
From

402
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,230
Jialin.

403
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,750
What a coincidence.

404
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:58,920
I'm from Jialin too.

405
00:25:59,400 --> 00:25:59,960
Really?

406
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,180
I'm from Mang Village.

407
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:03,510
Mang Village?

408
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,400
My

409
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,850
household registration is there.

410
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:10,640
But I moved to the city long ago.

411
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,440
The surname Ni is quite rare,

412
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,140
but in Mang Village,

413
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,880
it's actually a common surname.

414
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:18,310
Yes.

415
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:20,960
Ni Xiangdong.

416
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:28,760
Ye, Xiang, Rong, Yong, and Chuan.

417
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:30,110
So your father

418
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,970
should be from the Ye generation.

419
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,030
My father is called

420
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,130
Ni Caizeng.

421
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,090
The Cai generation.

422
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,090
The Cai generation?

423
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:44,080
There's no Cai generation.

424
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,920
How is that possible?

425
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:47,640
You seem to know a lot

426
00:26:47,660 --> 00:26:48,660
about our Ni clan.

427
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,640
I used to have a friend

428
00:26:50,910 --> 00:26:52,720
who, according to generational order,

429
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,400
should call you Uncle.

430
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:55,920
However,

431
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,480
he's much older than you.

432
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:04,310
Are you the only child in your family?

433
00:27:04,310 --> 00:27:05,830
Do you have any siblings?

434
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:07,070
No,

435
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,040
just me.

436
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:15,650
Why?

437
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,430
Nothing. Just chatting.

438
00:27:19,750 --> 00:27:21,440
Running into someone
from Nanyang in Weihai

439
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,400
is not easy.

440
00:27:22,790 --> 00:27:24,850
What's more, we're both from Jialin.

441
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,000
Yeah.

442
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,350
It's fate.

443
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,750
It is.

444
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:33,150
We have plenty of time ahead.

445
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:34,100
That's right.

446
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,840
We have plenty of time ahead.

447
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:38,920
Hello?

448
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:43,350
Fried pancakes.

449
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:00,270
Okay.

450
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:09,560
Something up?

451
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:12,480
Please tell Wang Cheng

452
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,360
that I have an emergency at home.

453
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,330
You're leaving?

454
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:28,730
I remember

455
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:30,530
you don't eat spicy food, right?

456
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:31,960
These two are for you.

457
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,490
He grilled the wrong order.

458
00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:34,300
Go ahead.

459
00:28:34,350 --> 00:28:34,750
I didn't order...

460
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:35,960
We made extra. It's free.

461
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:36,690
Just take it.

462
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:39,510
Thanks.

463
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:44,220
Alright.

464
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:44,590
I'll raise five.

465
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:45,520
I'll raise five.

466
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,160
I'll call.

467
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,160
Hurry up!

468
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:47,840
Finished.

469
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,400
Out.

470
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:49,440
Pass.

471
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,610
I'll match five.

472
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,050
Five, right?

473
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:54,400
Still calling?

474
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,030
Ten.

475
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:56,610
Show the cards.

476
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:57,980
Cao Xiaojun.

477
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:58,440
My turn.

478
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,580
Come play a few rounds.

479
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,840
Help me change my luck.

480
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:02,070
No money.

481
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:04,750
That's no fun.

482
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:05,680
Every time I ask you to play,

483
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,550
you're broke.

484
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:07,110
If you don't play,

485
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:08,840
how will you know if you can win?

486
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:09,680
Go ahead and play.

487
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:10,480
You guys play.

488
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:13,590
Hey, guy on the top bunk,

489
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:15,160
come down and play
Three-Card Brag.

490
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:15,690
This game

491
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:16,880
is only fun with more people.

492
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,480
Come play.

493
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:18,760
I don't know how.

494
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:20,350
I'm asking nicely

495
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,480
for both of you to join us.

496
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,240
One doesn't know how.

497
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,500
The other has no money.

498
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:24,610
What's that about?

499
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:26,210
Too good for me?

500
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,500
Too cool to join us?

501
00:29:27,830 --> 00:29:28,590
Not true.

502
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:30,440
I really don't know how.

503
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:32,680
Fine.

504
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:34,720
Go get us

505
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:35,650
some beer then.

506
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:37,030
Draft beer,

507
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,070
not bottled.

508
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:40,920
Who won?

509
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:41,550
Me.

510
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:49,640
Are you deaf?

511
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,270
I'm talking to you.

512
00:29:51,270 --> 00:29:52,310
Go buy some beer.

513
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:55,070
You asking for trouble?

514
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:55,730
Stop, stop.

515
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,790
Cheng. Cheng.

516
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,070
Don't stoop to his level.

517
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:00,870
Ni Xiangdong,

518
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:01,750
let's go.

519
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:03,280
I'll go with you.

520
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:07,310
That bastard Wang Cheng

521
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,910
just likes causing trouble.

522
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,720
He lost at cards yesterday,

523
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,650
now he's taking it out on everyone.

524
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:14,310
Try to avoid him.

525
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:16,440
Today it's beer,

526
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,200
next time it'll be cigarettes

527
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:18,880
or meat.

528
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:21,350
What can we do?

529
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,160
Nothing we can do.

530
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,140
Just avoid him when possible.

531
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,750
He's just a bully

532
00:30:27,830 --> 00:30:29,690
because his uncle is the foreman.

533
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,440
On his own merit,

534
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:32,790
he's nothing.

535
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,480
My taking leave today

536
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,240
will just give him
another excuse to harass me.

537
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:49,440
This morning,

538
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:51,570
I noticed

539
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:53,270
you seemed troubled.

540
00:30:58,590 --> 00:30:59,480
My son is sick.

541
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:01,630
Is it serious?

542
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,450
Do you need much more money?

543
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,790
Far from enough.

544
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:18,820
It's good if we can
just stabilize his condition.

545
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,170
Why not borrow from friends first?

546
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,200
Borrow from whom?

547
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:27,480
Everyone here does manual labor.

548
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,550
Who has spare cash?

549
00:31:30,390 --> 00:31:32,330
I'm a stranger in Weihai,

550
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:33,640
with no connections.

551
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,200
Enough, let's not talk about it.

552
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:39,610
It's not something that can be fixed

553
00:31:39,610 --> 00:31:40,610
in just a few days.

554
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,920
Winter is coming soon,

555
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,050
just one more month.

556
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,830
Before the work stops,

557
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:48,430
I should earn whatever I can.

558
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:01,020
What do you usually eat in your hometown?

559
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:02,680
Rice noodles.

560
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,160
Have you ever tried

561
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:07,170
pork stewed with vermicelli?

562
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:08,090
No, I haven't.

563
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,700
You've never had
pork stewed with vermicelli?

564
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,260
No.

565
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:13,750
Come back to the Northeast
with me and try that.

566
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:15,240
I'll treat you to
pork stewed with vermicelli

567
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,100
and pig-slaughter feast dishes.

568
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:18,640
Sure.

569
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:21,350
If I get a chance to visit Northeast.

570
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,270
I still need

571
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:24,350
to work here.

572
00:32:27,790 --> 00:32:28,850
After the New Year,

573
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,790
you probably won't even
get to eat fried pancakes anymore.

574
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:32,510
This shop of mine

575
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:34,240
might close after the New Year.

576
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:35,390
I'm quitting.

577
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:38,000
Not coming back?

578
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,920
It's not profitable.

579
00:32:40,070 --> 00:32:42,270
Look, there's nobody even at mealtime.

580
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,900
So I'm going back home.

581
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:51,370
What will happen to it when you leave?

582
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:53,600
I'll take care of it for you.

583
00:32:54,350 --> 00:32:54,960
Okay.

584
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,930
Just give it something to eat.

585
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:58,410
It's not picky about food.

586
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,480
We usually

587
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:00,480
just give it whatever,

588
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,340
and it eats everything just fine.

589
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:07,390
Two threes.

590
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,640
I only have two cards left.

591
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,850
You're playing two threes, right?

592
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:10,550
So what?

593
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,270
Two tens.

594
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:13,110
Cheng.

595
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:15,240
I still want to ask

596
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,840
about our salary situation.

597
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,940
It's been delayed for two months now.

598
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:21,720
When will I get

599
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:22,750
my money?

600
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:24,290
My wife has been nagging me

601
00:33:24,310 --> 00:33:25,150
for days now.

602
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:26,590
Yeah.

603
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:28,750
We haven't even been
paid for our previous work.

604
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:29,440
And now,

605
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,680
work has stopped again.

606
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,880
It'll be over two months.

607
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,070
The most important thing is,

608
00:33:33,070 --> 00:33:34,240
once work resumes,

609
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:34,830
how will

610
00:33:35,030 --> 00:33:36,030
we get paid

611
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:37,050
for all this time?

612
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:39,350
Everyone's waiting to get paid

613
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,240
so they can go home for New Year.

614
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:40,790
Alright.

615
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:41,940
Stop complaining.

616
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,960
What good does telling me do?

617
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,350
They owe me money too.

618
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:46,400
Just play your cards.

619
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,400
Can you top this pair of tens?

620
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,130
Well, but...

621
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:52,550
Where were we? Two tens.
Can you top them or not?

622
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:53,270
Two Jacks.

623
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,240
One card left.

624
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:57,330
Only one card left?

625
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,500
Can't beat it. You win.

626
00:34:03,030 --> 00:34:04,220
What cards are left?

627
00:34:04,790 --> 00:34:06,560
Cheng, you're not playing anymore?

628
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:07,110
I'm done.

629
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,460
Wang Cheng.

630
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,960
Why don't you go talk to

631
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,510
your uncle again

632
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:25,310
and ask him to make an exception?

633
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,150
My child really

634
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:27,550
needs money for urgent medical care.

635
00:34:27,550 --> 00:34:29,030
I can't delay it any longer.

636
00:34:29,030 --> 00:34:29,969
I just told you.

637
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,060
Didn't you hear me?

638
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:33,590
What's the point of coming to me?

639
00:34:33,590 --> 00:34:34,400
If you need money urgently,

640
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,730
just go to him directly.

641
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:47,920
Three fours.

642
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,280
Triple with a single.

643
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:49,800
Pass.

644
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,159
Three eights.

645
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:16,920
What?

646
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:20,150
Thanks.

647
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:21,710
No problem.

648
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:24,490
I don't spend much money usually.

649
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:26,360
I've already sent money home.

650
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,150
Take it.

651
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:32,690
It's fine.

652
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:35,690
The child's medical care is what matters.

653
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,230
I'll write you an IOU.

654
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,480
After the New Year when I have money...

655
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,880
We'll talk about it then.

656
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,510
Thank you, really.

657
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:50,990
Hurry to the hospital.

658
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,720
I'll take you to the station.

659
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:05,770
Wang Cheng.

660
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,440
Where did you

661
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,500
get all this money?

662
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:08,070
The meat...

663
00:37:08,070 --> 00:37:08,590
Come with me.

664
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:09,720
It's cheap and good.

665
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:10,130
Meat.

666
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:11,190
I just love eating meat.

667
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:12,880
It's been so long since I had meat.

668
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,590
I'm getting hungry.

669
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:14,230
That place we ate at last time

670
00:37:14,230 --> 00:37:15,160
was really good.

671
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,070
Give me back my money.

672
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:00,890
What money?

673
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,150
The money I kept inside my pillow.

674
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:04,280
Who took your money?

675
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,440
-Give it back to me.
-What's wrong with you?

676
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,320
Who took your money?

677
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,190
-Didn't you take it?
-They're lottery tickets.

678
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,630
-Who took your money?
-What's in your pocket?

679
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:11,280
-Get your hands off me.
-How could you afford lottery tickets?

680
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:11,840
Stop it.

681
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:12,550
Give it to me.

682
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:13,880
You're drunk, aren't you?

683
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:14,280
Give me the money.

684
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,810
Get off! What are you doing?

685
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,100
You want to fight?

686
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,280
Are you drunk?

687
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:19,920
If you damage my lottery tickets,

688
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:20,740
I'll kill you.

689
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:22,320
Give it to me.

690
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:26,370
What are you all doing?

691
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,460
What are you doing?

692
00:38:30,670 --> 00:38:31,330
Move aside.

693
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:31,960
Uncle.

694
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:32,850
He's crazy.

695
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:34,530
He took my money.

696
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:35,670
Let me tell you.

697
00:38:36,070 --> 00:38:37,400
New Year is coming soon.

698
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:37,920
If either of you

699
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:38,980
causes me trouble,

700
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:39,920
I'll see to it he hasn't a penny

701
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,760
to his name come Chinese New Year,

702
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:41,510
and I'll have him thrown out.

703
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:42,510
Uncle, make him leave.

704
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:43,440
Make him go away.

705
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:44,550
He stole my money.

706
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,280
You're causing trouble, huh?

707
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,000
If you don't want to work, get lost.

708
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:48,320
You,

709
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:49,120
get lost!

710
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:50,030
Go!

711
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:18,800
Yellow, are you comforting me?

712
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:22,770
You know I'm upset.

713
00:39:27,510 --> 00:39:28,670
You're the best.

714
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,190
So warm-hearted.

715
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:50,250
Are you hungry?

716
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:51,880
Wait a moment.

717
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,070
I'll go buy you something delicious.

718
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:53,760
Okay?

719
00:39:55,030 --> 00:39:55,550
Okay.

720
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,040
I'll go get it for you.

721
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,320
Wait for me.

722
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:13,640
It's boiling.

723
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:14,550
Come, pour me some.

724
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:15,150
Have some.

725
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:16,350
This soup is so fresh.

726
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:27,880
Yellow.

727
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,470
Yellow, come out.

728
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:37,840
Yellow, where are you?

729
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:40,360
I bought you meat buns.

730
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:41,480
Come out and eat.

731
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:44,960
Smells good.

732
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,330
Cover it.

733
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:54,210
Wait a bit.

734
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,190
Cover it up.

735
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,740
Let it simmer a bit longer.

736
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,140
Simmer it more.

737
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:03,000
A bit longer.

738
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,040
Put it down.

739
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,550
It's so cold today.

740
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:14,770
Got to eat something.

741
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,340
What's cooking in the pot?

742
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:16,820
What do you mean what?

743
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:17,420
What is it?

744
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,640
I'm asking you.

745
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:20,440
Are you crazy?

746
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,370
Where's Yellow?

747
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,000
Who's Yellow?

748
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:22,630
How would I know?

749
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:23,630
My dog.

750
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:24,920
It's your dog.

751
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,190
Why are you coming to me?

752
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:27,510
What's cooking in that pot?

753
00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:27,920
Well.

754
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:29,190
Once it's all stewed,
it all tastes the same.

755
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:30,650
What do I care what's in it?

756
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:34,110
You kicked my pot!

757
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:42,590
Stop fighting!

758
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:43,280
Hit him!

759
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:44,110
Get him!

760
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,910
Hit him, Cheng!

761
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:48,920
Cheng!

762
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:49,400
Cheng!

763
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:50,760
Look.

764
00:41:51,230 --> 00:41:52,110
Is this Yellow?

765
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,650
Try it.

766
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:54,800
Taste it.

767
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:55,800
Is it Yellow?

768
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,400
Try some.

769
00:41:58,590 --> 00:41:59,190
You bit me!

770
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:00,000
Let go!

771
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:00,530
Release him!

772
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:01,180
Let go!

773
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:03,120
Release!

774
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:04,400
Let go!

775
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:05,320
You bit me?

776
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:06,980
Beat him up!

777
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,170
Kill him...

778
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:11,080
What are you doing?

779
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:12,540
That's enough.

780
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:13,440
Let go.

781
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:15,440
This has nothing to do with you.

782
00:42:16,670 --> 00:42:17,110
If you don't back off,

783
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:18,570
both of you get out of here!

784
00:42:20,870 --> 00:42:22,020
I'll kill you.

785
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:23,070
I'll finish you.

786
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:30,590
I'll kill you.
