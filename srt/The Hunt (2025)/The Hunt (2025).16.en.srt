00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,800
If he misappropriated any money,

162
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,750
we would pursue him for embezzlement

330

And more importantly,

368
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:04,610
look familiar?

369

Was this how you show your love for him?

You even tried to kill his mother.

380

and become an orphan.

face your students in the future?

383
00:19:35,310 --> 00:19:36,180
When your father

384
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:36,880
asks you about this,

385
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,210
how will you answer him?

386
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:38,970
Enough.

387
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,350
Say no more.

388
00:19:40,570 --> 00:19:42,350
You were once a teacher.

389
00:19:42,790 --> 00:19:43,700
You don't look like

390
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,920
a teacher at all.

391
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,270
You have no sense of responsibility,

392
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,750
yet you taught your students

393
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:48,750
to be good people.

394
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,400
You're afraid to face the truth.

395
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,160
Yes.

396
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:52,830
You're afraid to face the police.

397
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:53,550
Yes, I am.

398
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,640
If you had even a little faith

399
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,830
in us police officers,

400
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:57,920

402
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,010
What about that kid?

403
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:04,480
He's only 7.

404
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:06,310
How will he

405
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:07,680
face his life?

406
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,350
How can he ever trust anyone?

407
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:11,150
Ni Xiangdong!

408
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,480
I killed him.

409
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:29,240
Say it again.

410
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,110
Ni Xiangdong...

411
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:40,640
was killed by me.

412
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,340

414
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,720

427

You have medicine?

428
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:46,170
Where is it?

429
00:22:46,590 --> 00:22:47,330

You're badly injured.

435
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:14,710
Why did they want to kill you?

436
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:16,320
Why did they want to kill me?

437
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:19,930

Don't move.

445

What should we do now?

446
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:38,810
Take me down the mountain.

447
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,980
Down the mountain?

448
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:42,090
Down the mountain?

449
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,370

we've already shared the information

with the Nanyang police.

I'm not trying to excuse her.

501

It's just that...

Wu Ximei committed murder

503
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,290
because she was pregnant at that time.

504
00:29:57,070 --> 00:29:59,130
If she hadn't been pushed to the edge,

510
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:39,410

Yes.

Nothing.
