Stalling for time now

203
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:32,530

208
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,080
She must be up to something,

209

219
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:03,710

Having you confess

231
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:25,670

At that time,

Ni Xiangdong was already addicted
to drugs.

He often didn't come home,

240

One night he came home

242

and suddenly went crazy,

243
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,339

to settle a score with someone.

When I tried to stop him, he...

247

pinned me down on the bed

248
00:17:20,109 --> 00:17:21,440

He stabbed him once in the back.

252

253

kicked Xiaojun away

254

257

lying on the floor.

259
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,640
I went to check on them

260
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,480
and found Ni Xiangdong was already dead.

261
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,170
Are you sure he was dead at the time?

262
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,860
His stomach was covered in blood.

263
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,370
Other than the wounds...

264
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,790
on his stomach and back,

265
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:12,670
were there wounds anywhere else?

266

No.

I couldn't handle both of them.

271
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,310
So I thought of a way

272
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:28,640
to separate them.

273
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:33,010
Whoever
went to the Chengxi construction site,

274
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,640
it would buy me some time.

275

281

I told him,

282
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:46,920
"I didn't do anything.

284

Then he suddenly got agitated.

285
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,330
He stabbed me with a knife.

286
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,330
I could only fight back.

287
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:01,200
Then I grabbed a rock

288
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,270

00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:04,480
You gambled that Mount Fufeng is so vast,

578
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,200
with so many rocks,

579
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,930
the police would never find it.

580
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:09,960
You gambled
that even if the police searched,

581
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,480
they might eventually give up

582
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:14,360
because the mountain is too big,
the rocks too numerous.

583
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:15,420
But you were wrong.

584
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:17,960
We police are best

585
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,500
at unraveling clues thread by thread

586
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:25,720
and finding a needle in a haystack.

587
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,200
The test results are conclusive.

588
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,270
The blood residue on the mountain rock

589
00:30:38,270 --> 00:30:40,130
matches the victim's blood type.

590
00:30:40,390 --> 00:30:41,520
The residual fibers

591
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,720
match those on the discovered glove.

592
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:44,480
Currently,

593
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:46,310
we are comparing the DNA on the glove

594
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:47,640
with the suspect's DNA.

595
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,480
I didn't kill him.

596
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:01,030
Why would I kill him?

597
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:03,270
We police solve cases

598
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,800
based on evidence

599
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:06,770
and thorough investigation.

600
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:09,000
Even without your confession,

601
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,010
as long as the evidence

602
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,880
is solid and sufficient,

603
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,750
we can still convict you.

604
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:18,590
Regarding the current situation,

605
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:19,650
I can tell you this:

606
00:31:19,790 --> 00:31:20,550
physical evidence,

607
00:31:20,550 --> 00:31:21,720
forensic conclusions,

608
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:24,050
and investigation records are complete.

609
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:25,450
It's enough to form

610
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,140
a complete chain of evidence.

611
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:29,280
You can keep saying you don't know.

612
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,280
You can say you're not sure.

613
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:33,440
Or you can

614
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,640
continue to remain silent

615
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,590
as you are now.

616
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:36,790
But

617
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,550
it will only affect yourself.

618
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,160
The name Xu Qingli—

619
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:50,810
you should know it, right?

620
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,550
So his name is Xu Qingli.

621
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:59,690
Now we have found

622
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,380
the real Ni Xiangdong's body.

623
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:05,380
Having you confess now

624
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,550
is giving you a chance

625
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:07,880
for leniency.

626
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,000
Tell us,

627
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:12,650
how did the real Ni Xiangdong die?

628
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,200
If

629
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:18,130
the one who died wasn't Ni Xiangdong,

630
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,800
it would be me and Cao Xiaojun.

631
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:23,410
Why do you say that?

632
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,930
Because Ni Xiangdong
killed someone at the time.

633
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,540
He killed someone?

634
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:32,790
Who did he kill?

635
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:34,640
Bao Desheng.

636
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,200
One night,

637
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:40,730
he came back from outside,

638
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:43,750
carrying a black leather bag.

639
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:46,310
His clothes were covered in blood.

640
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:47,690
Then Xiaojun checked

641
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,240
that leather bag.

642
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:51,560
There was a lot of money inside.

643
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:53,790
And the Bao family's gift receipt list.

644
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,200
Xu Qingli.

645
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,640
How was your relationship

646
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,640
with Cao Xiaojun?

647
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,550
We used to be friends.

648
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:16,470
Did he ever talk to you

649
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,550
about his past?

650
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,150
He never mentioned to you

651
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,140
he and Ni Xiangdong were sworn brothers,
did he?

652
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:26,020
They'd been gang members since childhood,

653
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:27,420
causing a lot of trouble.

654
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:28,410
But later,

655
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,070
Cao Xiaojun turned over a new leaf,

656
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:31,870
while Ni Xiangdong sank deeper,

657
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,310
ending up with a life on his hands.

658
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:34,770
There was no turning back.

659
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,680
Ni Xiangdong killed someone?

660
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:42,310
You've lived under Ni Xiangdong's name

661
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:43,830
for all these years.

662
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:46,080
Don't you know anything about him?

663

If

664
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,680

667

When that happens,

00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,830
would you be Ni Xiangdong

or Xu Qingli?

672
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,000
I would definitely be Xu Qingli.

00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:47,740
I stabbed Ni Xiangdong to death.

764
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,940
It wasn't Xiaojun.

765
00:40:52,210 --> 00:40:54,010
I stabbed him over a dozen times.

766
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,280
Xiaojun helped me bury the body.

767
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:03,920
Xiaojun was a good man.

768
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,800
I failed him.

769
00:41:27,030 --> 00:41:28,760
I also killed Guo Adi.

770
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:31,440
I used a hatchet.

771
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,000
All my life,

772
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:39,150
I listened to my mother.

773
00:41:41,150 --> 00:41:41,800
After my mother died,

774
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,400
I listened to my grandmother.

775
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,930
After my grandmother died,

776
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,620
I listened to my uncle.

777
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,590
After I killed Guo Adi,

778
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,760
I listened to Ni Xiangdong.

779
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:00,300
I thought he would love me.

780
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:06,940
Only Xiaojun listened to me.

781
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:17,400
Good and evil
always get their just retribution.

782
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,190
If I committed evil,

783
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:30,130
why should the retribution
fall on Tianbao?

784
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:49,550
This life has been so meaningless.
