1
00:00:03,086 --> 00:00:05,880
(Acceptance email from a foreign company)

2
00:00:12,554 --> 00:00:15,265
What should I tell Sunbae?

3
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:23,189
Ian, what are you doing?

4
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:25,483
What are you hiding?

5
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:27,652
Ah...

6
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:30,280
It's nothing.

7
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:32,699
You're acting a bit strange lately.

8
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:38,788
Trying to gloss it over with cuteness?

9
00:00:38,913 --> 00:00:40,874
If you noticed, just pretend you didn't.

10
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:46,087
I can handle things like that well... I'm just worried.

11
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:49,299
I haven't sorted out my thoughts yet.

12
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:52,510
I'll tell you when I'm ready.

13
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:55,263
Alright.

14
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:02,145
There's still so much I want to do with Sunbae.

15
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:06,775
I want to keep being with him like this...

16
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,986
Sunbae probably feels the same way...

17
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:11,738
What should I do?

18
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,993
You're okay, right?

19
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:18,912
Yes, really! I'm fine.

20
00:01:26,419 --> 00:01:29,631
Maybe because my past sins are so great...

21
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:31,716
Even if your expression changes slightly, Ian,

22
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:32,717
I get worried.

23
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:35,095
You were still worrying about that?

24
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,971
Of course I am.

25
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:38,681
When you were struggling with job hunting,

26
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:40,892
instead of comforting you,

27
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:42,352
I treated you coldly.

28
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,145
Hmm...

29
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:46,022
Did you?

30
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:48,483
I forgot everything, I don't remember a thing.

31
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:53,279
That's why

32
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:56,282
when you look even a little bit troubled,

33
00:01:56,282 --> 00:01:58,785
I feel worse and get more concerned.

34
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,041
Ian?

35
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:16,845
What do I do? I like you even more now, Hyung.

36
00:02:17,178 --> 00:02:19,013
Then just like me more.

37
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:27,105
It's almost our 1st anniversary. What shall we do?

38
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,649
Well...

39
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:32,110
Isn't there anything you wanted to do?

40
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,194
Since it's your first relationship.

41
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:37,824
I told you not to say that.

42
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:39,826
Your reaction is so cute,

43
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,703
I can't help but want to do it.

44
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:44,539
Ah, forget it.

45
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:50,962
Since it's your first, I want to make it extra special.

46
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:54,757
I want you to do everything you've wanted to do.

47
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,390
Mr. Ian?

48
00:03:03,766 --> 00:03:06,895
Are you asleep?

49
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:17,488
Goodnight.

50
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:23,912
I was also looking forward to a special 1st anniversary with Sunbae...

51
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,831
Sunbae, should I just not leave?

52
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:31,169
Should I just give up everything and stay by your side?

53
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:11,918
I said I'd wait until you tell me, but...

54
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:16,130
what kind of worry is it that you can't even speak about it?

55
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:48,746
Was this what you were worried about?

56
00:05:04,152 --> 00:05:06,014
(Juhyeok Hyung)

57
00:05:10,545 --> 00:05:12,732
(I finish early today. Want to grab a beer?)

58
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:41,299
Did he notice?

59
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:44,594
Did I make it too obvious?

60
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:50,266
I haven't even organized what to say yet...

61
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,520
I used to come here often alone.

62
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,439
Alone?

63
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:58,149
Yeah.

64
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:00,360
When I had a lot on my mind.

65
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,321
Back when I couldn't convey my true feelings to you.

66
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,824
I drank here alone frequently.

67
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,578
Did coming here solve things?

68
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:13,206
Didn't you just get drunk?

69
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:15,166
Hmm...

70
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,001
Since I came here out of habit,

71
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:19,796
it was good for clearing my head.

72
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:24,008
The day you first asked to meet me,

73
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:26,386
I sat here alone and worried about it too.

74
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:30,014
So we were able to meet thanks to this place.

75
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:31,808
Right?

76
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:38,439
Then, today as well...

77
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,900
did you bring me here to organize my thoughts?

78
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:46,155
Well, partly that, and...

79
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:50,118
I was thinking about where you could speak comfortably,

80
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,994
and this was the result.

81
00:06:59,168 --> 00:07:00,128
Ian.

82
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:05,425
Don't you have something to tell me?
