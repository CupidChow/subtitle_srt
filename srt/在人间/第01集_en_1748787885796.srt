1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Underwater

2
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:19,540
because of arians

3
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:28,060
I am leaving

4
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:31,060
I leave with you

5
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:35,060
Will you look for me?

6
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,060
Will you only look for me?

7
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:44,060
To the same place

8
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:52,060
Find a place to spend time

9
00:00:53,060 --> 00:01:03,060
When I leave with you

10
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:10,060
Will you look for me?

11
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:20,060
I have walked through the familiar corner

12
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:26,060
The familiar corner

13
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:35,060
The place meant to be

14
00:01:50,060 --> 00:02:02,060
The place meant to be

15
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,060
I am Xu Tian

16
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,060
I like someone

17
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,060
I can't be without him

18
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,060
But he doesn't know

19
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,060
His name is Jia Xiaoduo

20
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,060
He doesn't like to wear a dress

21
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,060
He doesn't like to wear makeup

22
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,060
He doesn't wear high heels

23
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:43,060
Your surname is...

24
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,060
What's wrong?

25
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:50,060
You are going in and out

26
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:52,060
Will you be out?

27
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,060
Who is Jia Xiaoduo?

28
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:55,060
I like her

29
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,060
So you want to experience

30
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:00,060
To be a woman

31
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,060
I want to know how she thinks

32
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,060
We are in your space

33
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,060
Not a big deal

34
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:13,060
You will be in some kind of body

35
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,060
You will be in some kind of body

36
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,060
But you are still you

37
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,060
What's the use of that?

38
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,060
The agreement is very clear

39
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:26,060
The safety medicine will help you to sleep

40
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:29,060
The device will enter the front of your brain

41
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,060
The front of your front teeth

42
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,060
To help you to release your subconscious

43
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,060
The shape of the space

44
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:37,060
Is based on your subconscious

45
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,060
The hidden corner

46
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,060
It seems to be

47
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,060
The dream

48
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,060
It's a vice-director

49
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,060
You are a vice-director when you are dreaming

50
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,060
We are the volunteers

51
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:56,060
To test the stability of your space

52
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:58,060
You should be a dream

53
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,060
No one gives you money

54
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,060
When you are dreaming

55
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,060
Money is not enough

56
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,060
Or you can fill something else

57
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,060
What?

58
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,060
For example

59
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,060
A big fortune

60
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,060
Or a fish

61
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,060
A sandfish

62
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,060
Anything from Ultraman

63
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,060
If you can't do it

64
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,060
You are a knife

65
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,060
A green dragon and a moon knife

66
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,060
That's fine

67
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:28,060
Didn't you say you have to fill

68
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,060
The most people

69
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,060
Many people want this

70
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:36,060
I just want to be a little more

71
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:42,060
You are very familiar with it

72
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,060
I am not familiar with it

73
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,060
Okay, fill it up

74
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:49,060
After filling it up

75
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:51,060
I will pay you one

76
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:57,060
Isn't it just about the good-for-nothing and the job?

77
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,060
It has to be filled

78
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:02,060
This is going to be a village party

79
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,060
Can't sleep

80
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:07,060
What if I really become a woman

81
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:11,060
Then I think you may have a lot of thoughts

82
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:20,060
System is now on the line

83
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:23,060
The number you have dialed is now on the radio

84
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,060
Am I testing tomorrow?

85
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,060
Why?

86
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,060
I am driving a bus

87
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,060
Who is the car?

88
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,060
Jia Xiaoduo

89
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:27,560
The

90
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,060
Although No. 17 is confirmed

91
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,060
I must tell Jia Xiaoduo in this trip

92
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,060
I like him.

93
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,060
You don't know if he is single.

94
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:01,060
He will not like me.

95
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:04,060
I will tell him my thoughts.

96
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,060
The driver has arrived at the parking lot.

97
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:13,060
It's better than looking at it secretly in the taxi.

98
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,060
What's up?

99
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:33,060
The car is over there.

100
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:49,060
Is there a girl in the car?

101
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,060
It's possible.

102
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,060
The car is over there.

103
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,060
The car is over there.

104
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,060
The car is over there.

105
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:03,060
The car is over there.

106
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,060
Hello, Jia Duo.

107
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,060
Jia Duo.

108
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,060
Are you tired?

109
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,060
You are being blocked.

110
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:40,060
I am asking you if you are tired.

111
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,060
I am fine.

112
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:47,060
One surprise.

113
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,060
You are waiting.

114
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,060
There is no evil at all.

115
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,060
Let's go to the white valley.

116
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,060
You are the first one.

117
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,060
Don't be too self-conscious.

118
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,060
We are all lost.

119
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:07,060
We will be lost for the next 100 days.

120
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:09,060
I want to find a partner.

121
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,060
Find a partner.

122
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,060
Do you understand?

123
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,060
How many years have passed?

124
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,060
Do you understand?

125
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,060
I understand.

126
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:18,060
Xiaoling, we are a couple.

127
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:20,060
You can understand if you talk.

128
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,060
Are you sick?

129
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,060
I am sick.

130
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,060
So I have to ask you.

131
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,060
Do you care about me?

132
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,060
I am sick.

133
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:32,060
Do you care?

134
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,060
You are too self-conscious.

135
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,060
You are too self-conscious.

136
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,060
I am a student.

137
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,060
I am a student.

138
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,060
I am a student.

139
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,060
I am a student.

140
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:40,060
I am a student.

141
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,060
I am a student.

142
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,060
I am a student.

143
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,060
I am a student.

144
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,060
I am talking to you.

145
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,060
What are you pretending to be?

146
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,060
I don't care.

147
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,060
You are sick.

148
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,060
I am very tall.

149
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,060
I will eat with you.

150
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,060
Are you sick?

151
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,060
Are you sick?

152
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,060
You are so annoying.

153
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,060
I use your car many times.

154
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,060
The third month of the third month,

155
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,060
I have borrowed your 17-time car.

156
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,060
17-time car?

157
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,060
I have borrowed your 17-time car.

158
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,060
No.

159
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:30,060
I'm going to the car.

160
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:42,060
I was calling you.

161
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,060
I didn't talk to you.

162
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:53,060
I did it on purpose.

163
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,060
I'm sorry.

164
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,060
I'm sorry.

165
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,060
I was wrong.

166
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:30,060
I'm sorry.

167
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,060
What do you mean?

168
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,060
I did it on purpose.

169
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:51,060
What's the matter?

170
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,060
Tell me.

171
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:55,060
You beat me to death.

172
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:57,060
What do you want?

173
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,060
The Western Shrine Hospital.

174
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,060
The hospital.

175
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:18,060
Psychological disease.

176
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:21,060
It's not a good thing to do at any time.

177
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:24,060
If you don't fight, you can go back to the car.

178
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,060
You can't beat me.

179
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:39,060
I'm going to the hospital.

180
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:50,060
I'm going to the doctor.

181
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,060
Captain.

182
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,060
Captain.

183
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,060
Captain.

184
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,060
Can we talk for the last time?

185
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:03,060
Can I be sick?

186
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,060
Let's understand each other.

187
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,060
Let's talk.

188
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:09,060
Can we talk?

189
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,060
Come on.

190
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,060
Captain.

191
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:15,060
I didn't say I just wanted to find a partner.

192
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,060
If you do that,

193
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:18,060
you can go to the Shrine Hospital and get a job.

194
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,060
Come down.

195
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,060
Am I a partner?

196
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:25,060
Am I a partner?

197
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,060
Get off.

198
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,060
What's wrong with you?

199
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,060
Get out of there.

200
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,060
Is your car safe?

201
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,060
It's worth it.

202
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,060
Who's that?

203
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,060
Get out.

204
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,060
Get out.

205
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,060
Damn.

206
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:57,520
He moves the building first!

207
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,580
He shifts construction materials first!

208
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,680
He changes the deadlines!

209
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:05,360
There's nothing to do today!

210
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,420
Chinese restaurant

211
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:08,260
Simple

212
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:10,280
R Taste

213
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,360
The place where mom lives

214
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,480
Xun Yi

215
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:18,120
Call a kiss, just kiss.

216
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,280
Make sure you answer these.

217
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,320
What's this?

218
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:44,400
Sorry, the car named Julie-Nana?

219
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,480
I want to call the police.

220
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,480
I don't want to.

221
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,480
You don't want to? I'll drive.

222
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,480
He knows the truth.

223
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,480
I'll drive him up the hill later.

224
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,480
What's going on?

225
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,480
Am I suspicious?

226
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,480
I wanted to find a partner in the city.

227
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,480
But I met a mental illness.

228
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,480
He's really sick.

229
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,480
Everyone is sick now.

230
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,480
Xu Tian, right?

231
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,480
Yes.

232
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,480
Do you drink?

233
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:42,480
Yes.

234
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,480
Do you like drinking?

235
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,480
I've seen you.

236
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,480
How much?

237
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,480
It's not convenient to drive.

238
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,480
What do you like?

239
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,480
I like to be excited.

240
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,480
You like to be excited?

241
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:09,480
I'm more excited than you.

242
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,480
I often be a cat.

243
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,480
A different cat.

244
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,480
I see myself in a car.

245
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,480
Under the water.

246
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,480
You're really a driver.

247
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,480
How do you know?

248
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,480
How do you know I'm a glutton?

249
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,480
I know you.

250
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,480
I know you.

251
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,480
How old are you?

252
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,480
32 years old.

253
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,480
What's your name?

254
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,480
I'm Tian Chengduo, the businessman of September 32.

255
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,480
How long have you been on the road?

256
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,480
The one who met you just now is a mental illness.

257
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,480
Are you a pervert?

258
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,480
I don't know when you'll need to get in the car.

259
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,480
I'll take it as my last visit.

260
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,480
I'll show you.

261
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,480
How long are you going to watch?

262
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,480
I'm going to watch the movie.

263
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:34,480
I'm going to watch the movie.

264
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,480
I'm going to watch the movie.

265
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,480
I'm going to watch the movie.

266
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,480
I'm going to watch the movie.

267
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,480
I'm going to watch the movie.

268
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,480
Half a year, a few months,

269
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,480
I'll be gone after this season.

270
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,480
Have you ever been on my side?

271
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,480
I like you. I can't control myself.

272
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:58,480
I like Chengdu.

273
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,480
I'm a god.

274
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,480
I'm anxious.

275
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,480
I know.

276
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,480
Take the video out.

277
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,480
I'll find a place to test it for you.

278
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,480
Chengdu, you've changed your destination.

279
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,480
You can't go home.

280
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,480
I just got a slap.

281
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,480
I don't want that mental illness

282
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,480
to follow me home.

283
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,480
I'll be in trouble.

284
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,480
I'm going to watch the movie.

285
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,480
Where are we?

286
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,480
The secret room.

287
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,480
I just finished it.

288
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,480
I haven't finished my homework yet.

289
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,480
Come on.

290
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,480
What's wrong?

291
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,480
You don't come.

292
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,480
You like Chengdu.

293
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,480
You're a pervert.

294
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,480
Come on.

295
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,480
What's wrong?

296
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,480
You don't come.

297
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,480
You like Chengdu.

298
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,480
You're a pervert.

299
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,480
Come on.

300
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,480
What's wrong?

301
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,480
You don't come.

302
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,480
You like Chengdu.

303
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,480
You're a pervert.

304
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,480
Where is this?

305
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,480
I can't see anything.

306
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,480
It's a light.

307
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,480
Hold my hand.

308
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,480
Follow me.

309
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:22,480
What?

310
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,480
Is this your hand?

311
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,480
It's so cold.

312
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,480
It's cold from the beginning.

313
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,480
I'll hold the shoulder.

314
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,480
Don't touch it.

315
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,480
What's this?

316
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,480
It's a hand.

317
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,480
It's a hand.

318
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,480
It's a hand.

319
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,480
It's a hand.

320
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,480
It's a hand.

321
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:44,480
It's a hand.

322
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,480
It's a hand.

323
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,480
It's a hand.

324
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,480
It's a hand.

325
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,480
What's this?

326
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,480
A fake hand.

327
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,480
A fake hand.

328
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,480
Oh, my god.

329
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,480
A fake hand.

330
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,480
How long has it been with a fake hand?

331
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,480
It's so exciting.

332
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,480
Sorry.

333
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,480
I'm busy.

334
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,480
It's a draw.

335
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,480
What's the problem?

336
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,480
How long has it been with a fake hand?

337
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,480
Let me untie it.

338
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,480
Let me do it.

339
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,480
It hurts.

340
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:38,480
You have to be with me.

341
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,480
You're going to kill me.

342
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,480
How long has it been with a fake hand?

343
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,480
About three months.

344
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,480
I'm going to kill you.

345
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,480
Why don't you know when I'm going to kill you?

346
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,480
Get up.

347
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,480
What's going on?

348
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,480
When did you start?

349
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,480
November 11.

350
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,480
You're quite clear.

351
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,480
It was raining that day.

352
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,480
I hit the car on my head.

353
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,480
What?

354
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,480
Then?

355
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,480
Then

356
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,480
the bag was taken away.

357
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,480
He sent me to the small district gate

358
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,480
and sent the bag to my house upstairs.

359
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,480
Is that true?

360
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,480
I'm in the house.

361
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,480
Gu Nan's daughter.

362
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,480
I'm in the house.

363
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,480
It's appropriate.

364
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,480
I've already washed my clothes.

365
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,480
I took off my clothes, went in, closed the door.

366
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,480
They're both completely suitable.

367
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,480
How can I?

368
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:52,480
I was wrong.

369
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,480
I was wrong, okay?

370
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,480
I'll agree to whatever you say.

371
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,480
Disappearance.

372
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,480
This is not okay.

373
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,480
You really make people hate you.

374
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,480
How can I beat him?

375
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,480
I don't hate him.

376
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,480
You don't hate him.

377
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:11,480
You're so loud when you eat, drink, drink and chat.

378
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,480
Am I loud?

379
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,480
Yes.

380
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,480
The business is very big now.

381
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,480
My ears are swollen.

382
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,480
You're mentally ill.

383
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,480
You have a headache.

384
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,480
You're almost a border guard.

385
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,480
It's okay to see you as a border guard.

386
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,480
It's okay to see someone else.

387
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,480
It's okay to see him.

388
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,480
I'm so tired.

389
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,480
I like you too.

390
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,480
Disappearance.

391
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:34,480
I have a witness, okay?

392
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,480
Understand.

393
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,480
How can I understand?

394
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,480
You're fine with it.

395
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,480
You just passed by.

396
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,480
You pretended to be a witness.

397
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,480
You've been looking for me for days.

398
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,480
You're so stupid.

399
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,480
How dare you hit me?

400
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,480
I didn't.

401
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,480
Give me another three.

402
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,480
Xiaoduo.

403
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,480
Don't go.

404
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,480
Put me down.

405
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,480
Xiaoduo.

406
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:14,480
Xiaoduo.

407
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,480
Put me down.

408
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,480
The test hasn't been completed yet.

409
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,480
What's going on?

410
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:46,480
I know where you live.

411
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,480
Hello?

412
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,480
You're being too careless.

413
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:18,480
What am I doing?

414
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,480
Aren't you going to do a test?

415
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,480
You haven't finished the test yet.

416
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,480
How can I leave?

417
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,480
I know where your house is.

418
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,480
What's wrong?

419
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,480
Don't pretend to be reluctant.

420
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,480
You're going to be back in a few days.

421
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,480
I'm going to the police station.

422
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,480
Hurry up.

423
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,480
Don't forget who you are.

424
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,480
Stop there.

425
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,480
You disappeared after you said it.

426
00:27:58,480 --> 00:27:59,480
That's it.

427
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,480
You're so cruel.

428
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:09,480
Let's go.

429
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:11,480
I'll stand here and watch you disappear.

430
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:14,480
Don't regret it.

431
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,480
I'll see you.

432
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:40,480
I'm not afraid of you.

433
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,480
I'm afraid of you.

434
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,480
Who am I playing with?

435
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:06,480
I'm just playing with you.

436
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,480
I'm sorry.

437
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,480
Do you understand?

438
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,480
How many episodes?

439
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:25,480
I was born on September 30th.

440
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,480
I was born in Tiancheng.

441
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,480
You were born in Tiancheng.

442
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,480
I had a dream.

443
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:33,480
You did it one by one.

444
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,480
You think I'm a pervert?

445
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,480
You're pervert.

446
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,480
The test result is ten episodes.

447
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,480
And then?

448
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,480
Before the car is parked,

449
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,480
I'll transfer the WeChat message to you.

450
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,480
You don't need to drive anymore.

451
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,480
How many times have you done it?

452
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:00,480
Seven times.

453
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,480
How long can it last?

454
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,480
It's too annoying.

455
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,480
I have to go.

456
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,480
That's all?

457
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,480
Thank you.

458
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,480
Thank you.

459
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,480
Hey!

460
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,480
Stop the car.

461
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,480
Come on!

462
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,480
Stop the car.

463
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,480
Stop the car.

464
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,480
Stop the car.

465
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,480
Stop the car.

466
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,480
Stop the car.

467
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,480
Stop the car.

468
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,480
Stop the car.

469
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,480
Stop the car.

470
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:42,480
Stop the car.

471
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,480
Stop the car.

472
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,480
Stop the car.

473
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,480
Stop the car.

474
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,480
Stop the car.

475
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,480
Stop the car.

476
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,480
Stop the car.

477
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,480
Stop the car.

478
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,480
Jiang Xiaoduo!

479
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,480
Jiang Xiaoduo!

480
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,480
A.I.

481
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,480
B.I.

482
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,480
C.I.

483
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,480
C.I.

484
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,480
C.I.

485
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,480
B.I.

486
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,480
C.I.

487
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,480
C.I.

488
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,480
C.I.

489
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,480
B.I.

490
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,480
C.I.

491
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,480
B.I.

492
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,480
What's going on?

493
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,480
What's going on?

494
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,480
B.I.

495
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,600
I like him.

496
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:27,240
What's wrong with him?

497
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,880
Is there anyone else?

498
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,040
Jia Youduo won't be in my car.

499
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,200
He won't come back.

500
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,320
Is there anyone else?

501
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,400
In this car

502
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,280
there's someone he wants backgrounds.

503
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,760
Her name came in.

504
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,480
I won't ask for it anymore.

505
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,800
I can't see him anymore.

506
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,280
You need space.

507
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,080
You need to have a chance.

508
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:51,080
How many times do you need to measure it?

509
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:55,080
I'll measure it too.

510
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,080
It's done.

511
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:58,080
Come on.

512
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,080
I'll measure it.

513
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,080
Zhou Bo.

514
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,080
You need to take a rest today.

515
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,080
Take a rest.

516
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:15,080
You need to show me on the car.

517
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,080
Zhou Bo.

518
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,080
Go.

519
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,080
Zhou Bo.

520
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,080
Zhou Bo.

521
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,080
Zhou Bo.

522
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,080
Zhou Bo.

523
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,080
Zhou Bo.

524
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,080
Zhou Bo.

525
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,080
Zhou Bo.

526
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,080
Zhou Bo.

527
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,080
Zhou Bo.

528
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,080
Zhou Bo.

529
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,080
Zhou Bo.

530
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,080
Zhou Bo.

531
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:30,080
Do you want to read it?

532
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:40,080
Do you want to read it?

533
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:50,080
Zhou Bo.

534
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:19,080
Zhou Bo.

535
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,080
Zhou Bo.

536
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:53,080
I'm moving.

537
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:57,080
Only the one I've been waiting for

538
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:03,080
will be the one I've been destined to miss.

539
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:06,080
In every world

540
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:11,080
Fates will keep on going.

541
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:14,080
Round and round

542
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:16,080
In every island

543
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:23,080
There will always be a last time

544
00:46:23,080 --> 00:46:30,080
There will always be a long way to go

545
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:40,080
There will always be a long way to go

546
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:45,080
There is a long way to go
