00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,920
Sponsor

2
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,940
When I leave

3
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:35,620
When I leave with you, will you look for me?

4
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:39,460
Will you only look for me?

5
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:44,700
To find a place in the same place

6
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:53,420
Find a place where I can be broken

7
00:00:53,420 --> 00:01:10,060
When I leave with you, will you look for me?

8
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:20,060
I've been through familiar corner

9
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:27,060
Familiar corner

10
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:36,060
The place meant to be

11
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:56,060
The place meant to be

12
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:59,060
The place meant to be

13
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:06,060
The place meant to be

14
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:16,060
The place meant to be

15
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:24,060
The place meant to be

16
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,060
I've done a lot of things in the morning

17
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:29,060
This is the most important thing

18
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:33,060
I remember it for the rest of my life

19
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,060
It's our birthday

20
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,060
I always feel that

21
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,060
It's my mood

22
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,060
I'll wait for you

23
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,060
Wait for the second

24
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,060
Wait for the second

25
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:25,060
After the bridge, you'll go back

26
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,060
It's hard enough

27
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:29,060
We'll go to the bridge

28
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,060
Wait for the second

29
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:07,060
We've met many people in the rest of our life

30
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:09,060
It's all for the sake of life

31
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,060
Only you in the future

32
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,060
No one will tell us

33
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:24,060
No one will know we're together

34
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:31,060
What if you're crazy?

35
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,060
What if you're crazy?

36
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,060
What if you're crazy?

37
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:40,060
From this corner to that side

38
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,060
Count how many times

39
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,060
How many times

40
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:48,060
Ask you

41
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,060
Three

42
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,060
Seven

43
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,060
I lost you the other day

44
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:07,060
You wrote a note in this piano

45
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:11,060
Tell me when you'll be waiting

46
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:13,060
I can't

47
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:17,060
We're the same shadow

48
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,060
This city is not good

49
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:32,060
Without us

50
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:35,060
It's still dark

51
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:37,060
Day

52
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:42,060
Then

53
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:44,060
What if you're offline

54
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:47,060
You also leave a line in that tube

55
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,060
I can find you

56
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,060
OK

57
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,060
Go back

58
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:59,060
Go back

59
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,060
There's something behind the car

60
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,060
Do you want to take a look?

61
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,060
What?

62
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,060
I'll do it for you

63
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,060
Go back and take a look

64
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:21,060
Take a look

65
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,060
Go back

66
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:47,060
Look at how many things I did this day

67
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,060
Go back

68
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:28,060
Go back

69
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:58,060
Go back

70
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:28,060
Go back

71
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:58,060
Go back

72
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:28,060
Go back

73
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:58,060
How are you?

74
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,060
Not feeling well?

75
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:18,060
I'm fine

76
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,060
This time is the longest

77
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,060
How long?

78
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,060
Three hours and forty minutes

79
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:39,060
It's done

80
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:45,060
Get up and drink water

81
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,060
Sit down

82
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,060
Don't play sweet

83
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,060
Don't exaggerate your feelings

84
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:12,060
Of course you don't have to cut the gold

85
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,060
Just let your feelings write

86
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:16,060
What's wrong?

87
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:22,060
This pen is not familiar

88
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,060
How can it be?

89
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,060
It's not right

90
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:31,060
Use this one for the past few months

91
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:34,060
Not right now

92
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:37,060
Use this one for the past few months

93
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,060
The gold part

94
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:52,060
Finally remove the medicine

95
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,060
Or the effect of the life

96
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,060
I've heard a lot of times

97
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:01,060
I've heard a lot of times

98
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,060
I

99
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:07,060
Ten days

100
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,060
When you went to Cui Mian in the morning

101
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,060
You still have to hide

102
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,060
When you went to Cui Mian in the morning

103
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:33,060
You still have to hide

104
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,060
You still have to hide

105
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,060
I have to hide

106
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,060
I have to hide

107
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:48,060
Do you think he will come back?

108
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:54,060
He won't come back

109
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:57,060
How do you know?

110
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:59,060
Can I go out now?

111
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:01,060
Of course.

112
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:03,060
You can go out anytime.

113
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,060
I told you that

114
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:07,060
this is not a prison.

115
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:10,060
I don't want to go out anymore.

116
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:28,060
Do you have any feelings?

117
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,060
Nothing.

118
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:36,060
When you came to this prison,

119
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:38,060
Did you feel that you lost your super power?

120
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,380
No.

121
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,500
You think that there is only one emotion in a person's heart.

122
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,000
It can't be used for other emotions.

123
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,340
Yes.

124
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,000
When you were on the back of the stage,

125
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,500
there was a voice that seemed to be comforting you.

126
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:58,500
Or you felt that you were hugged by someone else.

127
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,880
I...

128
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,300
Oh good.

129
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,800
Angle...

130
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,980
I hear a piano playing from both出來.

131
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:19,280
You want me to have your side?

132
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,580
You know what to do.

133
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,940
I hit the piano.

134
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:32,720
Yes, that's me.

135
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,080
so

136
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:40,800
I'll hold the years

137
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,440
right

138
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,200
So good

139
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,720
You once told me

140
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,720
Why do you come here?

141
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,000
I never changed my mind.

142
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,040
So did you change your mind?

143
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,720
I didn't.

144
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,320
Brother Biao,

145
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,320
you really want a leave.

146
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:31,320
It was Xiaoduo who died.

147
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,320
At that time, you had five brothers.

148
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,320
One of them was Yuzhan,

149
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,320
the other one was Tie Lin,

150
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,320
Wang Yangming,

151
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,320
the other one was Liu Tiao.

152
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,320
Xiaoduo was one of the strongest.

153
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,320
He even thought he was the main character.

154
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:53,320
He even thought he was the main character.

155
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,320
The main character?

156
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,320
Usually, he is a vice character.

157
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:02,320
He doesn't know the main character exists.

158
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,320
But he is an exception.

159
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,320
It's very dangerous.

160
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,320
It's not a good thing.

161
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,320
He helped us

162
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,320
remove those vice characters.

163
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,320
Good.

164
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,320
Xiaoduo removed the other characters' purpose

165
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:32,320
to search for you in the surrounding areas.

166
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,320
It's like a bird

167
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,320
who cares about the surrounding grass.

168
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,320
But it's also looking for other things far away.

169
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:45,320
It's in your spiritual world.

170
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,320
It's looking for you.

171
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,320
Zhang Tuolui.

172
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:59,320
Zhang Tuolui.

173
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,320
And he is a disciple.

174
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:07,320
When he was in your world,

175
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:09,320
you weren't there.

176
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,320
When you were in this world,

177
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,320
he wasn't there.

178
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,320
He was there.

179
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,320
We've never met.

180
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,320
The vice character doesn't meet the main character.

181
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,320
Even in the virtual world,

182
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,320
he doesn't meet.

183
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:41,320
He doesn't meet in the original character.

184
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,320
He doesn't meet in the original character.

185
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,320
In the original character,

186
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,320
he doesn't meet.

187
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,320
That's good.

188
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,320
If...

189
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,320
If...

190
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,320
If...

191
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,320
He succeeded in taking me away.

192
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,320
Almost.

193
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,320
If he really replaced you,

194
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,320
you still look like

195
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,320
your soul.

196
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,320
It's him.

197
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,320
But he still can't find you.

198
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,320
Almost.

199
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,320
What do you mean?

200
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,320
I asked him a question.

201
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,320
If he had to make a choice between you

202
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,320
and let one of you disappear,

203
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,320
how would I choose him?

204
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,320
He chose himself.

205
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:53,320
Why does the vice character think so?

206
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,320
He thinks

207
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,320
he's the main character.

208
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,320
Doctor Shi, it's time to take medicine.

209
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,320
It's coming.

210
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,320
I'm glad you cured me.

211
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:13,320
Thank you.

212
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,320
Your phone.

213
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:19,320
Some people don't need it anymore.

214
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,320
They need me to take you away.

215
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,320
Who?

216
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,320
You.

217
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,320
I'm the one who called.

218
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,320
You called me these days.

219
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,320
You forgot?

220
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,320
You're going to the hospital?

221
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,320
I need to inform your sister to pick you up.

222
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,320
Then contact me.

223
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,320
Okay.

224
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,320
I'll give her a month's worth of medicine.

225
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,320
Okay.

226
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,320
Thank you.

227
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,320
He's recovered?

228
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:31,320
Tell him to come back after taking the medicine.

229
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:37,320
But in the morning, Jia Xiaoduo is still here.

230
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,320
Jia Xiaoduo is still here.

231
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,320
He should know it.

232
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,320
Can he know it?

233
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:50,320
I think he shouldn't.

234
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,320
He's a mentalist.

235
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,320
It's hard to say. Who knows?

236
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,320
I think it's good.

237
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,320
Is it?

238
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,320
A woman lives in my heart.

239
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,320
I can't forget it.

240
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,320
But they can't see it in the real world.

241
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,320
Forever?

242
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,320
Forever.

243
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,320
Take care.

244
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,320
I'm sorry.

245
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,320

00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,320
I'm sorry.

252
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,320

255
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,320
I'm sorry.

256
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,320
I'm sorry.

257
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,320

00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,320
I'm sorry.

261
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,320
I'm sorry.

262
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,320
I'm sorry.

263
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,320

I'm sorry.

267
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,320
I'm sorry.

268
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,320
I'm sorry.

269
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,320
I'm sorry.

270
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,320
I'm sorry.

271
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,320
I'm sorry.

272
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,320
The door is locked.

273
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,320
Why?

274
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,320
The doctor just called your sister.

275
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,320
He'll pick you up later.

276
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,320
The water is under the toilet.

277
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:03,320

And so

351
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,320
when I've witnessed

352
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,260
these negative emotions

00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:14,480

how's Zhang Yingying doing lately?

She turned to forgiving me

358
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,760
and parted ways

359
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:27,500
along her buttline

360
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:28,260

00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:28,760
fordong

362
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,080

Qianqing

369
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,740
He also likes me.

370
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:45,100
But he doesn't exist.

371
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,900
He has never existed.

372
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,460
How is that possible?

373
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:13,740
All the time, he has been busy and busy.

374
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:17,740
How can he not be anxious?

375
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:24,740
He must be somewhere.

376
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:32,740
How can he find him in the world?

377
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:39,740
He must be somewhere.

378
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,740
I don't know.

379
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:21,740
Brother.

380
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,740

381
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,740
I came to see you today.

382
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,740
I don't know where to go.

To the port.

384
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:37,740
No.

385
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,740
After Yiling's mother left,

386
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,740
I never went back.

387
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:43,740
Have you?

388
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:46,740
I don't think so.

389
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:55,740
I don't want to know where I'm going.

390
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:02,740
Anyway, you have to go far away.

391
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,740
Why are you so cruel?

392
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,740
It's okay if you're cruel.

393
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:23,740
I send you to the hospital every time I enter and out of the Western Shao Liao.

394
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:31,740
I don't want to do this.

395
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:08,740
Okay.

396
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:26,740
This is the car key

397
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:28,740
and the key to the room.

398
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:32,740
I'm not going up.

399
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:38,020
From now on, we're ok.

400
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,460
If you're okay,

401
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:44,220
go for a bit.

402
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,140
Alright.

403
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,180
What's the matter?

404
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:06,780
I didn't tell them that I'm getting married with Xiao Duo.

405
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:11,380
The doctor didn't tell you that

406
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,780
there's no fake Xiao Duo?

407
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,180
The ring is all sold out.

408
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:22,780
There's no ring, there's no fake Xiao Duo.

409
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:26,580
There's nothing. Don't think about it anymore.

410
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,580
The ring is in the car.

411
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:42,180
The car that you came out from

412
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:44,580
hasn't been opened for three months.

413
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,980
I remember it's in the car.

414
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:52,980
Brother.

415
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:59,580
No one is sending you to the West Mountain anymore.

416
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:03,380
You should be fine. Don't go back anymore.

417
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:05,580
I won't go back anymore.

418
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,780
Don't worry.

419
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,780
They don't understand.

420
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:17,180
I will hide the fake Xiao Duo in my heart from now on.

421
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,180
Be fine.

422
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:32,580
I'm leaving.

423
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,180
I'm leaving.

424
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:02,380
Don't go back anymore.

425
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:32,380
Hurry up!

426
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,580
Hurry up!

427
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,580
Come on!

428
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:40,580
Hurry up!

429
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,780
Hurry up!

430
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:49,180
Hurry up!

431
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,780
Don't go back anymore.

432
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:01,580
Don't go back anymore.

433
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:32,580
Don't go back anymore.

434
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:54,380
If you hear me, I will throw you out.

435
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:58,380
In this coffin, you wrote a letter.

436
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:00,980
If you write a letter,

437
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:03,580
you should also leave a letter in that coffin.

438
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:05,580
I will look for you.

439
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:00,380
Don't go back anymore.

440
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:30,380
Don't go back anymore.

441
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:01,380
Don't go back anymore.

442
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,380
I'm hiding it in my heart.

443
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:33,380
No one knows.

444
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:30,380
I'm hiding it in my heart.

445
00:43:58,380 --> 00:44:00,380
I'm leaving.

446
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:30,380
I'm leaving.

447
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:00,380
I'm leaving.

448
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:30,380
Don't go back anymore.

449
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,380
Don't go back anymore.

450
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:30,380
I'm leaving.

451
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:01,380
The one who is too hurt

452
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:07,380
Can't find the one.

453
00:47:07,380 --> 00:47:10,380
The one who is too hurt

454
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:13,380
Can't find the one.

455
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:16,380
The one who is too hurt

456
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:19,380
Can't find the one.

457
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:22,380
The one who is too hurt

458
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:25,380
Can't find the one.

459
00:47:27,380 --> 00:47:30,380
In every world

460
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:34,380
I'm looking at the handkerchief.

461
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:36,380
Round and round

462
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:39,380
In every ending

463
00:47:39,380 --> 00:47:46,380
I will always be your lost and found.

464
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:50,380
The dusk of the wall

465
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:54,380
The rain that only stays

466
00:47:57,380 --> 00:48:00,380
The one in the crowd

467
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:05,380
The one who is outside the story

468
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:11,380
The one who is wandering around

469
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:16,380
In the crowd

470
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:21,380
The one who is destined to be lost

471
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:27,380
The one who is destined to be lost

472
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:30,380
In every world

473
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:35,380
I'm looking at the handkerchief.

474
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:37,380
Round and round

475
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:40,380
In every ending

476
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:47,380
I will always be your lost and found.

477
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:50,380
The one who is destined to be lost

478
00:48:50,380 --> 00:48:55,380
The handkerchief.

479
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:05,380
I will always be your lost and found.

480
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:09,380
The one who is destined to be lost.

481
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:13,380
The one who is destined to be lost

482
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:17,380
The one who is destined to be lost

483
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:20,380
The one who is destined to be lost
