1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,540
Last Day

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
You will look for me

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Will you look for me?

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
To find a place in the same place

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:53,000
Find a place where I can be broken

6
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:04,000
When I am broken, leave

7
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Will you look for me every night?

8
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Walk through the familiar corner of the past

9
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The place meant to be

10
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,000
The safety belt, safety rope, and the safety shoes are your horses

11
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:33,000
The task is to climb to the top without the eight-digit ring

12
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
After wearing it, the characters are explained

13
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's his most normal time to be N.T.H.

14
00:02:51,000 --> 00:03:09,000
X20D, I am D's boyfriend

15
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I am still your boyfriend

16
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,000
You are X, it's your turn

17
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
You like X, but you don't want to lose it

18
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Damn, it's not like that

19
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Start the task

20
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Keep an eye on the cover and the head

21
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Don't look down

22
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
You have to go up and say it

23
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Okay, go up

24
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Xiaoduo, don't take her two boats

25
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
It's normal to talk about normal work

26
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:31,000
X20D likes children

27
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
It's all right

28
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
How can you be a boyfriend?

29
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Isn't it a ex-boyfriend?

30
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Don't you want to lose me?

31
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Don't you want me to disappear?

32
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
According to the history of VIP

33
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
What's the situation?

34
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Xiaoduo, what's the situation?

35
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I want to climb up

36
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Where is the task?

37
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Everything is at the top

38
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
People are coming

39
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Let's talk

40
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
X20D, talk

41
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I went to experience a virtual space in the daytime

42
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
What virtual space?

43
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Say it now

44
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
You have to say it from the virtual space

45
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
What did you say?

46
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I want to go up, you two love it

47
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I'll give you two a place

48
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
You two are in love

49
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So high

50
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
The fun is the excitement

51
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
The higher the excitement

52
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Be careful

53
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
What did you say?

54
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
So taciturn

55
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
He said he likes you

56
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
And he said he wants to be brave

57
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
If you don't want to pretend, you won't be able to win

58
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I wish you two a good relationship

59
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Then I'll disappear

60
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
Hurry up and climb up

61
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I'll disappear when I climb up

62
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
I'll disappear when I climb up

63
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
What's going on?

64
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Isn't this a secret room?

65
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Why is it still flying?

66
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
The report is coming out

67
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
There is a 5m lamp, don't stop

68
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
How to light it?

69
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
There is a old camp on the top

70
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I went to experience a virtual space in the daytime

71
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I want to fight

72
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I need you

73
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
What's going on?

74
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I'm afraid

75
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Still in the virtual space?

76
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I used to be you

77
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Now I can talk to you

78
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
What do you mean?

79
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I like you at first

80
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
It was the day of October 11th

81
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
You said that?

82
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You want to say that?

83
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
What if you fall?

84
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It's fake

85
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
It's fake

86
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Then...

87
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Stop talking

88
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
There is a fake one

89
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I like you too

90
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Dong Dong

91
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It's good

92
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
I should have said earlier

93
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
It took me a lot of time

94
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
It's fake

95
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It's a secret room

96
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
It's good to die when you climb up

97
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
It's fake

98
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
It's fake

99
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It's fake

100
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
It's a fake

101
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
It's all fake

102
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
It's a real one

103
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
It's fake

104
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
It's fake

105
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Or we can call it together

106
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
I'll kill you

107
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
You can do it

108
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,000
Let's go together

109
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Then we can catch the goods

110
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,000
And tools

111
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,000
That's the knife

112
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It's not real

113
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You disappear

114
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
What do you think?

115
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Don't you want to be my friend?

116
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
I'm telling you

117
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
I disappeared this time

118
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Don't come to me again

119
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
OK

120
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Take the knife

121
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Go to the inside

122
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
The one below

123
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I should have said

124
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
You two can go out

125
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,000
No one is bothering me

126
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,000
Go upstairs

127
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Go upstairs

128
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Go

129
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
Go

130
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Go

131
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Go

132
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Xiaozong

133
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Xiaozong

134
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Xiaozong

135
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
Xiaozong

136
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
Xiaozong

137
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Xiaozong

138
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Xiaozong

139
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,000
Xiaozong

140
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
What's wrong?

141
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Tell me

142
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
What's wrong?

143
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Where is he?

144
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Who?

145
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Your ex-boyfriend

146
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
He was riding a motorcycle

147
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
When he was coming

148
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,000
The motorcycle

149
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,000
He locked it on the stone floor

150
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
He left

151
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
I don't have a boyfriend

152
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Where is your ex-boyfriend?

153
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Don't bother me

154
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I was confused

155
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Where is the pillar?

156
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Where is the stone pillar?

157
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Shouldn't there be a stone pillar?

158
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
It's the same as this one

159
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
I'm crazy

160
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
I'm also crazy

161
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,000
I'm crazy

162
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
I love you

163
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
Xiaozong

164
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
We were inside

165
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,000
The secret room

166
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
How many people?

167
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
You and me

168
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
We are the VIP

169
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
There is one more

170
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
You cut it with a knife

171
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
It's in the cliff

172
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Yes

173
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Yes

174
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,000
Xiaozong

175
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I'm crazy

176
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I'm crazy

177
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
How is it possible?

178
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:37,000
You asked to see him

179
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
He is an NPC

180
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
He was going to fall

181
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
The rope is not my brother, it's your brother

182
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Two NPCs

183
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
You are an NPC

184
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Two NPCs

185
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,000
I took your 3 months' flight

186
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
You asked me if I should play the game

187
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,000
last night

188
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
You promised

189
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,000
I thought you like me

190
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Yes

191
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Can you send me home?

192
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I want to see you

193
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
You are the only one

194
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I'm telling the truth

195
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
I met you three months ago

196
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I remember

197
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
I met you

198
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I remember

199
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
I met you

200
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
I met you

201
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I met you

202
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
I met you

203
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
This message

204
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I have adventures

205
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
I recognize you

206
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
That sign

207
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,000
I'm going to pick

208
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I was in the secret room.

209
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,000
You...

210
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
You didn't even make a contact with me.

211
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I just told your ex-boyfriend,

212
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
the one in the devil's room,

213
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
to wait for you there.

214
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
He came to tell me yesterday that you purposely let him do this.

215
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
He took me to the police station to look for you.

216
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,000
You were obviously a NPC.

217
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,000
You were in the game of climbing.

218
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
I was in the game of climbing.

219
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Jiang Changde!

220
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
This is...

221
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
This is...

222
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
You mean...

223
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Everything I said just now,

224
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
didn't exist, right?

225
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
You took me to the police station 18 times,

226
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
plus today, 19 times.

227
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
And then?

228
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
This is the first time you've told me yesterday.

229
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,000
And you're in the secret room after you are done with this.

230
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
Stop that.

231
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
What's wrong?

232
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
Do you need it?

233
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,000
No way.

234
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,440
You said you recorded me.

235
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:15,440
Yes.

236
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,040
It's the first time it rains in November.

237
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,760
I don't know how to talk to you.

238
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,360
I recorded seven times.

239
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,640
You said you wanted to test me yesterday.

240
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,280
And you even made Chen Chen say something.

241
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,440
I'll show you the way.

242
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,600
tempted

243
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,520
He needs to join the class.

244
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,160
Who!

245
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,800
Cut it out.

246
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,800
Malejie!

247
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:03,200
Pardon us,

248
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:07,920
What do we draw here?

249
00:22:09,560 --> 00:22:10,040
Choose a tree.

250
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:15,960
Which cage is it?

251
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:16,920
Fendps.

252
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,040
Isn't it open?

253
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,040
Four decreasing trees.

254
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:20,280
I want to draw the maternity line.

255
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:21,240
Disvent아!

256
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:22,000
Diarrhea.

257
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,000
Nurse.

258
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,480
Diarrhea!

259
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,000
Think carefully, I know you are not a florist well.

260
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,200
You were turning out to be a seductive.

261
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:34,180
Being seductive, but still said otherwise.

262
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:37,280
She's actually not a demonic.

263
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,840
I am really impressed.

264
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:46,560
You have learned something from nails.

265
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,720
Your nails are sticking out in the air.

266
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,680
Take a), now the door opens

267
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,480
Why did it open?

268
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,560
peanuts

269
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,520
Restあり're here

270
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,240
Your Highness

271
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:51,940
Stop!

272
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,320
What's wrong with you?

273
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:57,940
What's going on?

274
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,780
Don't scare me, Xia Rule!

275
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,440
Why so strong?

276
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:17,620
Breakers,

277
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:20,980
will stay with me,

278
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,080
Jin очень12KEY

279
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,480
Hmph

280
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,240
I have a bottle.

281
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,240
What are you doing?

282
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,240
Catch him!

283
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,240
Didn't you give me a reminder at first?

284
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,240
Didn't you investigate all kinds of diseases

285
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:29,240
that have been incurable in my social background?

286
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,240
What's going on?

287
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,240
I'm not being harsh.

288
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,240
This is real.

289
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,240
Do you know?

290
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,240
Where did you get this?

291
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,240
It's not mine.

292
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:08,240
You've already checked my address.

293
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,240
Can you verify the information?

294
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,240
I'd like to test it again.

295
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,240
I'm free this time. It's not necessary.

296
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,240
No need. We already have your data.

297
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,240
What data?

298
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,240
Show me.

299
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,240
You can't see it.

300
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,240
You can't see it? Explain it to me.

301
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,240
No need.

302
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,240
I have to test it again.

303
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,240
You're too mean.

304
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,240
If you don't mind, I'll take it.

305
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,240
Come here.

306
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:11,240
You're in a different state.

307
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,240
The result is different.

308
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,240
I'll ask you now.

309
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,240
Now?

310
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,240
Right now?

311
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,240
Am I still in your room?

312
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,240
Life is like a play.

313
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,240
Talk well.

314
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,240
Of course not.

315
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,240
I understand.

316
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,240
I went to a secret room in the police station yesterday.

317
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,240
Do you know that?

318
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,240
I came out of the police station this morning.

319
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:56,240
I can't make it real.

320
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,240
What's the secret room?

321
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,240
It's all fake.

322
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,240
Can the fake space be real?

323
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,240
The secret room is fake.

324
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,240
It's real now.

325
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:10,240
Now?

326
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,240
It's flat.

327
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,240
Life is flat.

328
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,240
It's always flat.

329
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,240
What's the value of the fake space?

330
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:24,240
Truth and illusion are different from human beings.

331
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,240
I found that it's similar.

332
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,240
Human brain.

333
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,240
It's just a single layer of life.

334
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:36,240
The big subconscious is under the control of the power.

335
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,240
Can I go in by myself?

336
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,240
What do you mean?

337
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,240
I want to see myself in the space.

338
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:45,240
Then you just need to take a mirror.

339
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,240
I can't see you in the space.

340
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,240
I can't see you.

341
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,240
I can't see my face in the space.

342
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,240
You're not in the dream.

343
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:58,240
I said I can't see myself in the real world.

344
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,240
But maybe I can see myself in the subconscious.

345
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:05,240
Human has the ability to be myself, self, and surpass me.

346
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,240
Through the training of the day after tomorrow,

347
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:10,240
the environment, and training, I can be myself.

348
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:13,240
I can be myself.

349
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,240
I can be myself.

350
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,240
I can be myself.

351
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,240
Being a superman and a common person,

352
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,240
the huge self is usually not exist.

353
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,240
But you're in the virtual space.

354
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:30,240
Maybe you can see yourself through another person.

355
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,240
Self is usually not exist.

356
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:40,240
Some people are completely self.

357
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,240
Completely self.

358
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,240
Who?

359
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,240
Psychological patient.

360
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:09,240
Can you choose to enter the virtual space?

361
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,240
What's the matter?

362
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,240
The first time you see me, you want to have time?

363
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,240
Didn't you just use her identity to enter?

364
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:40,240
Now I ask myself, go in and see her.

365
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:43,240
I'm not sure.

366
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:52,240
The basic personality is completely not clear.

367
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,240
Can't I?

368
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,240
Maybe in the subconscious,

369
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,240
you are her,

370
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,240
or she is you.

371
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,240
Then she's fine.

372
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,240
No.

373
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,240
Go in and face her.

374
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,240
In life,

375
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:15,240
there is no such thing as exist.

376
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:22,240
If there is, how can I like her?

377
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,240
I can't even sing.

378
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:29,240
Your state is very unstable.

379
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:31,240
It's not stable.

380
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,240
So you have to continue to be wrong.

381
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,240
If you go back to the wrong place, it's not stable.

382
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:37,240
If you have any problems in the virtual space,

383
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,240
you will be hurt.

384
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,240
Can you set the time to enter?

385
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:45,240
Everyone, look at your subconscious.

386
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,240
Do you have any deep impression on that time?

387
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,240
Go on the run.

388
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,240
Do I say that time?

389
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,240
Are you going to go on the run?

390
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,240
medo

391
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,240
Should go to the hospital.

392
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,240
Who knows that time might come.

393
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:15,240
You're APPLAUSE the , right?

394
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,240
com,

395
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,240
If anyone chooses be wolves,

396
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,240
with the return of the wolf

397
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,240
Xu Ling is looking for someone else in the city.

398
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:31,640
And that person may not exist in his life.

399
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,440
Who says he doesn't exist?

400
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,440
I know where he lives and where he lives.

401
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,640
What you think is nothing.

402
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:46,640
If you want to fake Xiao Duo, just do it.

403
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,640
That's usually the case.

404
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,440
What about me?

405
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,440
If he also wants you,

406
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,240
if you become his friend, you will be able to see yourself.

407
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,640
Don't you understand?

408
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:02,040
I understand.

409
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:05,040
What a heart has, is what it has.

410
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:07,440
Just like dreaming.

411
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,840
Find a mirror.

412
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:13,640
No. Just like waiting for me to see myself.

413
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,840
I'm not sure if he has a heart.

414
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,240
That's quite interesting.

415
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,840
You should do it again.

416
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,840
Is that right?

417
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,440
I've made up my mind.

418
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:30,040
You've made up your mind?

419
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,840
Or is it like this?

420
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,040
Fake Xiao Duo?

421
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,340
You...

422
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:38,040
Yes.

423
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,640
I think...

424
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,840
you should go to a Western Mountain Hospital first.

425
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,240
What?

426
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,440
Go ask that patient if he's your friend.

427
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,440
No.

428
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,440
If you miss it, you should know whether he's going to Western Mountain.

429
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,840
I'm not sure.

430
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,440
I'm not sure.

431
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,840
I'm not sure.

432
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,240
I'm not sure.

433
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,240
I'm not sure.

434
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,840
I'm not sure.

435
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,440
That's right.

436
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:24,040
You can set that time now.

437
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:27,640
You can just make up your mind.

438
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:30,380
I'll take the sadness if you brought me to the audience.

439
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:33,300
I don't want to take a tent.

440
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:38,120
Because I have sucholare girlfriend,

441
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:43,780
do something right from this moment on.

442
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:48,880
Today I came back here

443
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:52,560
for assessment training.

444
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,580
For the sake of the future.

445
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:26,980
I'm afraid I'll be late.

446
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:28,180
I'll go to the hospital.

447
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,380
I'll go to the hospital.

448
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:30,580
I'll go to the hospital.

449
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:31,780
I'll go to the hospital.

450
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:32,980
I'll go to the hospital.

451
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:34,180
I'll go to the hospital.

452
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:35,380
I'll go to the hospital.

453
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,580
I'll go to the hospital.

454
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,580
I'll go to the hospital.

455
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:38,580
I'll go to the hospital.

456
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,580
I'll go to the hospital.

457
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:40,580
I'll go to the hospital.

458
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:41,580
I'll go to the hospital.

459
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:42,580
I'll go to the hospital.

460
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:43,580

474
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:33,260
Ko

475
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,580
Hello?

476
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,820
Hello.

477
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:40,580
I...I arrived?

478
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:41,820
Where are you?

479
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,820
I've come quite a bit.

480
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:45,820
Not quite the same.

481
00:38:46,820 --> 00:38:47,420
I won't walk down from there.

482
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,820
You can't see me on your phone.

483
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:49,940
I can't see you.

484
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:53,940
Look.

485
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:55,940
Go down.

486
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,900
I'll talk to him.

487
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,260
If it's not smooth,

488
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:00,460
I'll add some money.

489
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:07,780
What are you doing?

490
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,340
There's a road in the car.

491
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:11,300
Don't get me wrong.

492
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,300
I've already found it.

493
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:16,540
You've found it yourself.

494
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:18,020
Isn't this a windmill?

495
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,740
It's not a car.

496
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:22,020
If the client is in a hurry,

497
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,100
I can't say it clearly.

498
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:25,940
I want to pick up some more.

499
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:42,740
The back is scattered.

500
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,460
Why is it so cruel?

501
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:47,420
It has nothing to do with the cruelness.

502
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,060
What does it have to do with him?

503
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:51,460
It has nothing to do with you.

504
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:53,780
I'm sorry.

505
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:54,860
I'll go to your mother.

506
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:18,420
Where's the umbrella?

507
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,300
I'll buy a bag of backpacks tomorrow.

508
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:27,740
I'm sorry.

509
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:29,620
I'm sorry.

510
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:30,420
I'm sorry.

511
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:31,100
I'm sorry.

512
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:31,700
I'm sorry.

513
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:18,940
Is it you?

514
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:23,100
It's me.

515
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:26,980
Xia Yutian came out to drive.

516
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:29,820
There was a woman who wanted to drive.

517
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:36,380
You can drive.

518
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,540
I remember.

519
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:48,580

570
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:07,780
I'll go in the morning.

I'll choose the wrong person.

575
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:23,780
In every world

576
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:27,780
The faith will keep on going.

577
00:44:29,780 --> 00:44:31,780
Round and round

578
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:33,780
In every ending

579
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:40,780
I will always be your lost one.
