00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
OPEN

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
You look back at me

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
You look back at me

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
To the same place

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:52,000
To find a broken place

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:03,000
When I leave

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Will you look for me every night?

8
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:20,000
I have walked through the familiar corner

9
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The familiar corner

10
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
The place meant to be

11
00:01:50,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The place meant to be

12
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The place meant to be

13
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:18,000
The place meant to be

14
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:28,000
The place meant to be

15
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Turn right

16
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
So many drinks

17
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Didn't you drive?

18
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
No

19
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Then how did you get there?

20
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I drove the electric car

21
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Okay, sign here

22
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
What's going on?

23
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
You've written it down

24
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
After you finish writing it, sign it

25
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I thought you had to sign it

26
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Who wrote it?

27
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
What's the name?

28
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
What's the relationship?

29
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
A friend

30
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
A boyfriend?

31
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
It's so late

32
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Don't be so silly

33
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Go home and sleep

34
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I haven't slept yet

35
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I haven't slept yet

36
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Can I borrow your umbrella?

37
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Yes

38
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:56,000
The place meant to be

39
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:06,000
The place meant to be

40
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:13,000
The place meant to be

41
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:23,000
The place meant to be

42
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:33,000
The place meant to be

43
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,000
The place meant to be

44
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:49,000
The place meant to be

45
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:59,000
The place meant to be

46
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:07,000
The place meant to be

47
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:17,000
The place meant to be

48
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:27,000
The place meant to be

49
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:36,000
The place meant to be

50
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:46,000
The place meant to be

51
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:56,000
The place meant to be

52
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:05,000
The place meant to be

53
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:15,000
The place meant to be

54
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:25,000
The place meant to be

55
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:34,000
The place meant to be

56
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:44,000
The place meant to be

57
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:54,000
The place meant to be

58
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:03,000
The place meant to be

59
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:13,000
The place meant to be

60
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:23,000
The place meant to be

61
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:32,000
The place meant to be

62
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:40,000
The place meant to be

63
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:48,000
The place meant to be

64
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:57,000
The place meant to be

65
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:07,000
The place meant to be

66
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:17,000
The place meant to be

67
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,000
The place meant to be

68
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I have a dream that I didn't realize

69
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
My dream is that you are Jia Xiaoduo

70
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Wake up

71
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I woke up

72
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Do you remember what happened before?

73
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
What should I remember?

74
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
The old mountain path

75
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
The bridge

76
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
The bridge

77
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
You can do it too

78
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I can do it too

79
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
That's so exciting

80
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Dream

81
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
My dream

82
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
That's fine

83
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You can do it

84
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Don't go

85
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I have to go back to him

86
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Who?

87
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Jia Xiaoduo

88
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Who are you?

89
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
I told you

90
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,000
You are an NPC

91
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I don't believe you

92
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,000
I am an NPC

93
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
You still have to go

94
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
You really make people sad

95
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Your ideal has been realized tonight

96
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
Don't be sad

97
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I want to stand in the middle of the road

98
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Passing through me

99
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
I have nothing to do

100
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
There is still a ideal that has not been realized

101
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
I am a man of my word

102
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I am a man of my word

103
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000

00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
I am a man of my word

108
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I am a man of my word

109
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000

110
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000

I am a man of my word

115
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
I am a man of my word

116
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
I am a man of my word

117
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I am a man of my word

118
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
I am a man of my word

119
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
I am a man of my word

120
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
I am a man of my word

121
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
I am a man of my word

122
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I am a man of my word

123
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I am a man of my word

124
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
I am a man of my word

125
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I am a man of my word

126
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I am a man of my word

127
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
Someone is there

128
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,620
The

The

144
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
The

The

00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
The

147
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
The

148
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
The

149
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
The

Isn't it going?

157
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Isn't it going?

158
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Is it a bit uncomfortable?

159
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
What's not going on?

160
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
What's the matter?

161
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
What's the matter?

162
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
What's the matter?

163
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Stop talking.

164
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Get off work

165
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Get off work

166
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Get out of my sight

167
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Get out of my sight

168
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Who am I?

169
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Who am I?

170
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Your lie

171
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
You are lying

172
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,360
Next to Prince Yin

173
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,240
It's been registrated three years ago.

174
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:42,840
But it hasnt came out yet.

175
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,120
Who's this?

176
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,860
This has none to do with you.

177
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,760
It doesnt matter.

178
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,220
Talk well.

179
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,480
Sorry regarding your mistake.

180
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:02,880
Thank you.

181
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:04,420
I will see it back.

182
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,360
I've been working on it for 30 hours.

183
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:12,360
Go and talk to the therapy teacher.

184
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:14,360
Get lost!

185
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:21,360
I'm sorry.

186
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:28,360
I'm Xu Tian.

187
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,360
Nan Nan.

188
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,360
What's going on with him?

189
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,360
What's going on with him?

190
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,360
You're Jiang Xiao Duo.

191
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,360
A woman.

192
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,360
What's going on with him?

193
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,360
You've been here twice.

194
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,360
This is your birthday present.

195
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,360
I've been here twice.

196
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,360
That's how I've been here?

197
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,360
Yes.

198
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,360
You've been here twice.

199
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,360
You must fill in the basic information.

200
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,360
I've already filled it.

201
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,360
I've already filled it.

202
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,360
I've already filled it.

203
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,360
Yes.

204
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:37,360
So I've been Jiang Xiao Duo.

205
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,360
Jiang Xiao Duo.

206
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,360
I'm sorry.

207
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,360
I'm looking for you.

208
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:44,360
Don't panic.

209
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:49,360
I'm hiding in a safe place.

210
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:55,360
A place where I can be a stranger.

211
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,360
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

212
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,360
Yes.

213
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,360
That's right.

214
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:09,360
Xiao Duo did his thuggy.

215
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:15,360
Didn't the guy just take you?

216
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,360
Do you think he's gonna do this to Lady Zhang?

217
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:25,360
The place where shadows come

218
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:32,360
Through the shadows and the dawn

219
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:54,360
The place where shadows come

220
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,360
Have you drunk?

221
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,360
No

222
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,360
It's our hotel

223
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,360
This is our hotel

224
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,360
You can contact me if you have something

225
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,360
It's raining outside

226
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,360
Can you take off your umbrella?

227
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,360
Yes

228
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:53,360
The place where shadows come

229
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,360
Are you okay?

230
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:20,360
I'll pay you back when I grow old

231
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:22,360
Remember to take care of yourself

232
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:53,360
The place where shadows come

233
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:00,360
Through the shadows and dawn

234
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:08,360
When I leave

235
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:14,360
I'll be your guide

236
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:18,360
When I leave

237
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:25,360
Will you look for me in the dark?

238
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:31,360
Through the rays of light

239
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,360
Shadows come

240
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:41,360
Through the shadows and dawn

241
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:48,360
When I turn around and leave

242
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:55,360
Will you look for me in the dark?

243
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,360
Through the past

244
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:05,360
The corner of my heart

245
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:16,360
The place where shadows come

246
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:32,360
When I leave

247
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:39,360
Will you look for me in the dark?

248
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:45,360
Through the past

249
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:49,360
The shadows come

250
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:55,360
Through the shadows and dawn

251
00:24:56,360 --> 00:25:01,360
When I turn around and leave

252
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:10,360
Will you look for me in the dark?

253
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,360
Through the past

254
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:20,360
The corner of my heart

255
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:32,360
The place meant to be

256
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:47,360
The place meant to be

257
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:16,360
The place meant to be

258
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:22,360
The place meant to be

259
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:27,360
The place meant to be

260
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:33,360
The place meant to be

261
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:38,360
The place meant to be

262
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:46,360
The place meant to be

263
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:52,360
The place meant to be

264
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:56,360
The place meant to be

265
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,360
Hello?

266
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,360
Hello?

267
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,360
Is it Jia Xiaoduo?

268
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,360
Yes.

269
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,360
Please give me your birthday.

270
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:04,360
Your ID number.

271
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:05,360
Why?

272
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,360
This is the 707 exhibition room in the first floor of the house.

273
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,360
The information technology of TXY

274
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,360
Has been used by Ms. Jia Xiaoduo

275
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:15,360
To cure the VIP psychological recovery treatment for 30 hours.

276
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,360
Is it your own?

277
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:23,360
Hello?

278
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,360
Yes.

279
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,360
When did you get the information?

280
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,360
It's the day of your birthday.

281
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,360
September 30th, 2000.

282
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,360
Please report it to the post office.

283
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,360
Hello?

284
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,360
0365.

285
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,360
No problem.

286
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,360
The treatment for the VIP psychological recovery treatment is 30 hours.

287
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,360
It's effective within 6 months.

288
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,360
It's effective within 6 months.

289
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,360
It's the time of the second day of the appointment before 8pm.

290
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,360
It's the time of the second day of the appointment before 8pm.

291
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,360
It's the time of the second day of the appointment before 8pm.

292
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,360
The first day of the appointment before 8pm.

293
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,360
The first day of the appointment before 8pm.

294
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,360
The first day of the appointment before 8pm.

295
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,360
The first day of the appointment before 8pm.

296
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,360
The first day of the appointment before 8pm.

297
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,360
The first day of the appointment before 8pm.

298
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,360
The first day of the appointment before 8pm.

299
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,360
Hello, doctor.

300
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,360
My name is Xu Tian.

301
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,360
Nan.

302
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,360
32 years old.

303
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,360
Hello, doctor.

304
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,360
My name is Jia Xiaoduo.

305
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,360
25 years old.

306
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,360
Actually, I know that I am Xu Tian.

307
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,360
I am a doctor.

308
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,360
I am a doctor.

309
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,360
Actually, I know that I am Xu Tian.

310
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,360
A few days ago,

311
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,360
I took part in a research space.

312
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,360
The new development of TXY company.

313
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:18,360
You know,

314
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:22,360
you asked me to come to TXY company.

315
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,360
It's chaotic.

316
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,360
Say it again.

317
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,360
My name is Xu Tian.

318
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,360
Nan.

319
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,360
32 years old.

320
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,360
It's here.

321
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,360
It's been a long time.

322
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,360
It's here.

323
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,360
It's here.

324
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,360
It's here.

325
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,360
It's here.

326
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,360
Hello, doctor.

327
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,360
My name is Li Yang.

328
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,360
My name is Jia Xiaoduo.

329
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,360
It's a bit strange.

330
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:27,360
But I am very sure.

331
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,360
I am Xu Tian.

332
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,360
Nan.

333
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,360
32 years old.

334
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,360
Jia Xiaoduo said that she likes a girl.

335
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,360
She likes her.

336
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,360
The first time I talked to Jia Xiaoduo,

337
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,360
she told me that

338
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:43,360
she was very close to me.

339
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,360
Before that,

340
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:47,360
I was going to give TXY company

341
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,360
a tour of Xu Ni's company.

342
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,360
At that time, I didn't make up my mind.

343
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,360
At night, Jia Xiaoduo took me to the police station.

344
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:00,360
I was very careful.

345
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,360
When the day was bright,

346
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,360
I thought I was going to be a good girl.

347
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:06,360
I was very careful.

348
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:20,360
So I decided to help TXY company

349
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,360
to tell me that I like Jia Xiaoduo.

350
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,360
That company has its own thoughts and dreams.

351
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,360
What is the meaning of the word

352
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,360
TXY?

353
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,360
I want to become Jia Xiaoduo

354
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,360
and find her feelings.

355
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,360
Two times.

356
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,360
Now I feel very uncomfortable.

357
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,360
I don't know

358
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,360
if this heart belongs to me or Jia Xiaoduo.

359
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,360
Last night, I was in Xu Ni's room.

360
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,360
Xu Tian died.

361
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:04,360
Now I can call the car.

362
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,360
There is a number of Xu Tian in my phone.

363
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,360
But I dare not answer.

364
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,360
I'm afraid that he will be in this world.

365
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,360
I'm not here anymore.

366
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,360
I don't know if this is the reason

367
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,360
why I became Jia Xiaoduo.

368
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,360
I would have known

369
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,360
if I didn't tell Xu Tian the truth.

370
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,360
He also said that don't be anxious to leave.

371
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:32,360
Maybe playing with him will save your life.

372
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,360
Shu Lu, I'm actually Xu Tian.

373
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,360
How could this happen?

374
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,360
Hello, I'm Xu.

375
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,360
I'm Jia Xiaoduo.

376
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,360
I called before.

377
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,360
But I didn't make a reservation.

378
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,360
Come with me.

379
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,360
Go to sleep.

380
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:27,360
707.

381
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,360
Can I?

382
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,360
The doctor will be here soon.

383
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,360
Hello, doctor.

384
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,360
My identity is the same as mine.

385
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,360
Girl, Jia Xiaoduo.

386
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,360
Please be quiet.

387
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,360
Hello, doctor.

388
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,360
My identity is the same as mine.

389
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,360
Girl, Jia Xiaoduo.

390
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,360
Please be quiet.

391
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,360
Because there is no reservation,

392
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,360
I can't call the car.

393
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,360
I'm afraid that I will be in trouble.

394
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,360
I'm afraid that I will be in trouble.

395
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,360
Because there is no reservation,

396
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,360
you only have five minutes.

397
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,360
I'm sorry.

398
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,360
How did you sleep last night?

399
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,360
Did you sleep well?

400
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,360
Sitting on the Berlin seagull.

401
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,360
But I must..

402
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,360
I'm Xu Tian.

403
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,360
I'm 32 years old.

404
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,360
Jia Xiaoduo is my favorite girl.

405
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,360
I really like her.

406
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,360
And?

407
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:32,360
Who are you?

408
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:36,360
I'm your doctor.

409
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,360
Who?

410
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:46,360
I was officially talked to by Jia Xiaoduo for the first time.

411
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,360
13 years ago,

412
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:53,360
I was going to give the TXY company a virtual space.

413
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:57,360
I didn't have a decision at that time.

414
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:02,360
At night, Jia Xiaoduo took me to the secret room of the police.

415
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:05,360
When it was dawn,

416
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:08,360
I think I definitely loved her.

417
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,360
And?

418
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:20,360
I feel very sad now.

419
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:24,360
I don't know if this heart belongs to me or Jia Xiaoduo.

420
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:27,360
I was in the heart yesterday.

421
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:30,360
Xu Tian died.

422
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:34,360
I can call the car now.

423
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,360
I have Xu Tian in my phone.

424
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:38,360
But I don't dare to call.

425
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:41,360
I'm afraid he's not in this world anymore.

426
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:46,360
I don't know if this is the reason why I became Jia Xiaoduo.

427
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:49,360
Xu Tian died.

428
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:53,360
How did he die?

429
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,360
You two,

430
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,360
take me to the left door.

431
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:21,360
I would have known that I didn't tell him the truth.

432
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,360
He also said,

433
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,360
don't be anxious to go down the line.

434
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:33,360
Maybe you can play for a lifetime.

435
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,360
I'm actually Xu Tian.

436
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,360
How could this happen?

437
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,360
Even if you know,

438
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,360
you still don't know.

439
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,360
What's going on?

440
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,360
This is the hospital in Xishan.

441
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,360
You are in the hospital for the cause of death.

442
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,360
It's a multi-person personality.

443
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:57,360
Our treatment is effective.

444
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:00,360
There are four types of personality in your body.

445
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,360
The one with the vitality of the body.

446
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,360
The one with the vitality of the body.

447
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:06,360
The one with the vitality of the body.

448
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,360
The one with the vitality of the body.

449
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,360
And the one with the motor.

450
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,360
Nonsense!

451
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:17,360
Who are you?

452
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,360
I'm your assistant doctor.

453
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,360
I'm a doctor.

454
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:25,360
Go to sleep first.

455
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,360
It's been three years.

456
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:38,360
We have been talking about treatment here twice a week.

457
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,360
We are mutual thanks...

458
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:42,360
I don't thank you.

459
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,360
My brain is about to explode.

460
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:51,360
Three types of personality in your body.

461
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:55,360
Fish eggs, six-piston and motor.

462
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,360
Now,

463
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:00,360
there is only one type left.

464
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:04,360
Who am I?

465
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,360
You are Jia Xiaoduo.

466
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,360
Xu Tian.

467
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:20,360
Come in.

468
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:30,360
Let's arrange the hypnosis treatment again next week.

469
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:38,360
Where am I?

470
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:43,360
I'll take the Emergency Department.

471
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:45,760
Take off.

472
00:43:52,080 --> 00:43:55,360
I heard you are preparing for your treatment.

473
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:58,360
Will it take me two days?

474
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:01,360
I won't do it for two days.

475
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,360
I won't take it for two days.

476
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:05,360
This kind of situation is rare.

477
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,360
What's going on?

478
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:12,360
The wife has the image of the main character.

479
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,360
Who has the image?

480
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:17,360
Let's meet again next week.

481
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:20,360
Thank you. I won't come back.

482
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:34,360
Go.

483
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:00,360
Go. 707.

484
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,360
Go.

485
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:34,360
Go.

486
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:04,360
Go.

487
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:35,360
Go.

488
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,360
Go.

489
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:34,360
Go.

490
00:48:03,360 --> 00:48:04,360
Go.

491
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:35,360
Go.
