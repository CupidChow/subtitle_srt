1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,440
That night

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,960
we went to wÃ¤re

3
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,800
I'm leaving

4
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:35,800
Will you look for me when you leave me?

5
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,800
Will you look for me?

6
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:44,800
To the same place

7
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:53,800
To find a broken place

8
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:09,800
Will you look for me when you leave me?

9
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:20,800
Walk through familiar corners

10
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:27,800
Familiar corners

11
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:35,800
The place meant to be

12
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,800
With the good weather and bad weather

13
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,800
You can see the world again

14
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,800
China's LaFang champion is chosen

15
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,800
The control is strong and the defense is short

16
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,800
The light is low and the rain is full of tears

17
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,800
You can see the world again

18
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,800
Little boy, hurry up and take a look

19
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,800
East Yanggong is called the eight-gong-gong-gong

20
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:59,800
You can see the world again

21
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,800
The world is different

22
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,800
The world is different

23
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,800
The world is different

24
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,800
The world is different

25
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,800
The world is different

26
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,800
The world is different

27
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:35,800
The world is different

28
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,800
The world is different

29
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,800
The world is different

30
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,800
The world is different

31
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,800
The world is different

32
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,800
The world is different

33
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,800
The world is different

34
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,800
The world is different

35
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,800
The world is different

36
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,800
The world is different

37
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,800
The world is different

38
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,800
The world is different

39
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,800
The world is different

40
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,800
I'm gonna read it

41
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,800
Do you want to read it?

42
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,800
Nan.

43
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,800
I'm 35 years old.

44
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,800
I was born on September 30th.

45
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,800
I'm a natural.

46
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,800
I'm a professional.

47
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,800
I'm a surgeon.

48
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,800
It's okay.

49
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,800
It's okay.

50
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,800
Have a taste.

51
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,800
Dear mother.

52
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,800
I'm writing a letter.

53
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,800
Your pen

54
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,800
is a product of a brand new factory.

55
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,800
I guess this factory is in the north.

56
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,800
When I was in school,

57
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,800
I always liked geography.

58
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,800
The last geography teacher taught me

59
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,800
was a pair of brown eyes.

60
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,800
I like brown.

61
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,800
And gray.

62
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:55,800
I heard that

63
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,800
the snake's eyes are green.

64
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,800
Everyone has eyes.

65
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,800
Some of them have blinded eyes.

66
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,800
Some of them can be blinded by dogs.

67
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,800
I can't see.

68
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,800
It must be a bad thing.

69
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,800
I know some of them.

70
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:16,800
Their hearing is good.

71
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,800
One person can have a good hearing.

72
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,800
The rabbit is also a person

73
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,800
who studies animal-eating.

74
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,800
What do you mean?

75
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,800
I'm writing this.

76
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,800
Will I have a heart?

77
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,800
Will I have a heart?

78
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,800
I'm sorry.

79
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:56,800
Why do you wear a earring?

80
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,800
I'm a thunderbolt.

81
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,800
I help to block those

82
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,800
who follow me and harm me.

83
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,800
Others are

84
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,800
forcibly.

85
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,800
Just tell me the task.

86
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,800
The secretary is so stubborn.

87
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,800
How can I get out?

88
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,800
I've been here for three years.

89
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,800
I wrote all the things

90
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:32,800
in this bucket.

91
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,800
But you

92
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,800
never

93
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,800
replied to me.

94
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,800
I can call you

95
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,800
if you don't reply.

96
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,800
If I leave this oil field,

97
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,800
I'll be shot.

98
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:56,800
As long as you tell me

99
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,800
that you're moving,

100
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,800
you can use the same method

101
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,800
as me.

102
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,800
If it's connected,

103
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,800
it's useless.

104
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,800
Because you're moving too.

105
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:04,800
So we...

106
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,800
So

107
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:10,800
we need to listen to him.

108
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:12,800
Otherwise,

109
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,800
the giant heart

110
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,800
will let

111
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,800
the hand gun

112
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,800
to be released.

113
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,800
So I never answered the phone.

114
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,800
And I never got out.

115
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,800
How long

116
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,800
do you have to wait?

117
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,800
157-6800.

118
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,800
I told you

119
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,800
that you've been here for three years.

120
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,800
Now it's three minutes and fifty seconds.

121
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,800
How will the time return?

122
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,800
I'll reply.

123
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,800
Will you reply?

124
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,800
You can leave now.

125
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,800
I can leave too.

126
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,800
I'm here to

127
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,800
wait for the phone to return.

128
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,800
Maybe it's already here.

129
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,800
But you haven't opened it yet.

130
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:07,800
I don't want to see

131
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,800
the whole thing.

132
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,800
How do we open the bucket?

133
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,800
It needs to be opened.

134
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,800
A key.

135
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,800
What's your name?

136
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:37,800
Xu Tian.

137
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:41,800
Xu Tian is a

138
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,800
man's name, right?

139
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,800
My name is Jia Xiaoduo.

140
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,800
You're a woman.

141
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,800
So you're Jia Xiaoduo.

142
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:00,800
Xu Tian lives in your body.

143
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,800
Sometimes you're him.

144
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,800
Sometimes he's more important than you.

145
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:10,800
If you hate someone,

146
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,800
you'll be like this.

147
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:13,800
If you love someone,

148
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:14,800
you'll be like this.

149
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:16,800
So you have to think of

150
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,800
all the ways

151
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,800
to make him disappear.

152
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:22,800
Whether it's love or hate,

153
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,800
if he disappears,

154
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,800
you'll be lonely.

155
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,800
Go.

156
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,800
Go find him with me.

157
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,800
Who is the lucky one?

158
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,800
Who is it?

159
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:20,800
It's yours.

160
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,800
I'm not going back.

161
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,800
I'm not going.

162
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,800
I'm not going back.

163
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,800
I'm not going.

164
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,800
Only mom.

165
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,800
What's your mom's name?

166
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,800
Yu Xiuyue, I...

167
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:00,800
Mom didn't tell you?

168
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:03,800
I'm with her.

169
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,800
Where?

170
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,800
U.S. port.

171
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,800
Port is town.

172
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,800
Yes.

173
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,800
Five years ago,

174
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,800
I lived in the rural area years ago.

175
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,800
I was in the 4th grade of 101.

176
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,800
I never went to school.

177
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,800
I went down a little bit every day.

178
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,800
He said he really couldn't stand this kind of weather.

179
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,800
So he left the school in 101.

180
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,800
He never came back.

181
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,800
He said

182
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,800
he was floating in the river.

183
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,800
But it was impossible.

184
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,800
I went back when I was in college.

185
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,800
River?

186
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,800
River is a good place.

187
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,800
It's a blue river.

188
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,800
It's a good place to take a bath.

189
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,800
And it's a good place to take a bath.

190
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:11,800
Why did you protect me?

191
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:14,800
I got the wrong idea.

192
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,800
I got the wrong idea.

193
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,800
The system is based on memory.

194
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:23,800
The blue one is in the cabinet.

195
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,800
I just found it.

196
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,800
Go.

197
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,800
Go together.

198
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,000
I'm sorry.

199
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,200
Give me your heart.

200
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,400
I'll see it when I get out.

201
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,400
Give me your heart.

202
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,000
Don't move.

203
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,000
I dare not.

204
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,000
Help me.

205
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,800
Help me.

206
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,200
It's okay.

207
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,400
Fish egg.

208
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,200
People always leave.

209
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,200
It's rare to have a snow.

210
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,200
You can only remember me like this.

211
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:07,600
But always remember good things.

212
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Don't write me anymore.

213
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,400
I won't read it.

214
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
It's gone.

215
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:22,200
It's gone.

216
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,000
Money will come back.

217
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,200
I should return it.

218
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,000
Are you talking?

219
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,200
Why should I talk?

220
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,000
This car will be destroyed.

221
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,000
Car?

222
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,400
It's a game.

223
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,600
Let's go together.

224
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,800
I think about it.

225
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,000
I'll return it.

226
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
I'm leaving.

227
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:05,400
Thank you.

228
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,600
Mr. Wang.

229
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,600
Mr. Wang.

230
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,000
Mr. Wang.

231
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,200
Mr. Wang.

232
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,300
Mr. Wang.

233
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,600
Mr. Wang.

234
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,800
Mr. Wang.

235
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,480
Tiong Video

236
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:14,920
You can take this

237
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,800
Didnemosia

238
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:37,860
Tiong Video

239
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,860
But no I don't know

240
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:43,860
Father

241
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,320
Previously, why did he throw up

242
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,220
I want to clean the overall air

243
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,160
The bait is easily found

244
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:52,960
At least I'm late

245
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,020
I know what the game is

246
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,520
But the game is higher than the game

247
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,900
Will have 10 times less

248
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,180
Time to return

249
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,120
I'm Ã¡reas to walk out

250
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,800
Still five minutes left

251
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,860
I need something to do.

252
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,860
Is there any use in saying that?

253
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:13,860
You've been coughing for a whole day.

254
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:16,860
If you don't have any sugar, let's go to the hospital.

255
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:28,860
Xiaoduo, you need to turn the phone off.

256
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,860
I'm Xu Tian.

257
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:34,860
I'm Jia Xiaoduo, the person in this game.

258
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,860
Then you are Jia Xiaoduo.

259
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,860
Who am I?

260
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:44,860
Niuqiao.

261
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:47,860
We've been together for a long time. Do you understand?

262
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,860
Who am I?

263
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,860
Niuqiao.

264
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:55,860
We've been together for a long time. Do you understand?

265
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:02,860
I don't understand. Tell me.

266
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:06,860
I'm from Guangchang.

267
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:09,860
I can't get through the three people in five meters.

268
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,860
There are people outside.

269
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,860
Six dogs and five people in Guangchang.

270
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:16,860
I don't know what to do. I just walk around.

271
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,860
Even I mention Sarah.

272
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:23,580
Even my guests are BostonÃ¢y,

273
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,860
waiting for me to dress up.

274
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:27,860
What?

275
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,860
I won't go out, either.

276
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,860
You can't hear me?

277
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:42,860
Can someone outside can hear you?

278
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,860
This is not a house.

279
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:47,860
This is a train that Yijie is on.

280
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:53,860
After four minutes, the car will fall from the cliff.

281
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:55,860
Although it's fake,

282
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,860
I'm afraid it's better to leave here.

283
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,860
Don't talk nonsense.

284
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:03,860
This is the new district 1101 in the new garden.

285
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:04,860
You listen to it again.

286
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,860
You listen to it.

287
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:45,860
I won't push you anymore.

288
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:01,860
Sit down.

289
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:07,860
This is 1101 in the new garden.

290
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:10,860
You got it?

291
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:15,860
Because I drive a car, I often take Zifang home.

292
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:19,860
Why do you always think you are Xu Tian?

293
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:43,860
Are you really leaving?

294
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:45,860
What should I do?

295
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:50,860
I'm going to find Jia Xiaoduo.

296
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:52,860
Who are you?

297
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:54,860
I'm Xu Tian.

298
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:56,860
Jia Xiaoduo is someone else.

299
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:58,860
Who am I?

300
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:04,860
Who is it?

301
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:05,860
I don't know.

302
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,860
Jia Xiaoduo.

303
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:41,860
Jia Xiaoduo.

304
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:11,860
The Greatest of Heavens.

305
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:13,860
Then let's be free.

306
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:15,860
What are you talking about?

307
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:22,860
Don't jump.

308
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:25,860
Don't jump.

309
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:27,860
Don't jump.

310
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:29,860
Don't jump.

311
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,860
Don't jump.

312
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:33,860
Don't jump.

313
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:35,860
Don't jump.

314
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:37,860
Don't jump.

315
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:39,860
Don't jump.

316
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:42,860
Don't.

317
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,860
Don't jump.

318
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:41,860
Don't jump.

319
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:11,860
Don't jump.

320
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:41,860
Don't jump.

321
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:11,860
Don't jump.

322
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:41,860
Don't jump.

323
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:05,860
Tie Lin.

324
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:07,860
Are you unhappy?

325
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:09,860
Can't you solve it?

326
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:19,860
Talk.

327
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:27,860
What do you need?

328
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:28,860
Tell me.

329
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:34,860
What do you want?

330
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:38,860
Tell me.

331
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:08,860
Don't jump.

332
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:38,860
Don't jump.

333
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,860
The system has been assigned to the number of the command post.

334
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,860
The order order of 9761.

335
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:15,860
He's still asking for my car.

336
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:17,860
That's great.

337
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,860
The first time is 18 times.

338
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:39,860
I'm going to tell him

339
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,860
about my plan for the game.

340
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,860
In the virtual space,

341
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:47,860
I'm his.

342
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,860
There are three people on the train.

343
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:56,860
They call me fake gambling.

344
00:31:58,860 --> 00:31:59,860
No one knows I'm Xu Tian.

345
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:10,860
The first time is 18 times.

346
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,860
The first time is 18 times.

347
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,860
I just had a dream.

348
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:34,860
If I tell him,

349
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:37,860
he'll think I'm mentally ill.

350
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:05,860
Go down.

351
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:08,860
I asked him to leave.

352
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:10,860
He's not here.

353
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:13,860
Come, take a look at this.

354
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:18,860
I'll beat you to death.

355
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:20,860
I'll beat you to death.

356
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:22,860
You'll beat me to death.

357
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:23,860
I'll beat you to death.

358
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:26,860
You're so smart.

359
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:28,860
You're so smart.

360
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:30,860
You're so smart.

361
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:32,860
I'm not a fool.

362
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:33,860
I understand.

363
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,860
The police have to send you back.

364
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,860
The one who beat you yesterday

365
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:39,860
is his.

366
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:40,860
His name is Mr. Jia Xiao.

367
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,860
He's a man of the past.

368
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:44,860
He's a man of the past.

369
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:45,860
He's a man of the past.

370
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:46,860
He's a man of the past.

371
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:47,860
He's a man of the past.

372
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:48,860
I'll explain it to you.

373
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:50,860
He's mentally ill.

374
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:52,860
He's mentally ill.

375
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:54,860
All the problems on his body

376
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,860
have to be put on my head.

377
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:58,860
I really don't understand.

378
00:33:58,860 --> 00:33:59,860
He's always confused.

379
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,860
He always understands.

380
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:03,860
He's always confused.

381
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:05,860
He's always confused.

382
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:07,860
I'm not a fool.

383
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:09,860
I'm not a fool.

384
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:11,860
I'm a man of the past.

385
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:13,860
He's a man of the past.

386
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:15,860
He's a man of the past.

387
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:17,860
He's always confused.

388
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,860
He just told me to make up.

389
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:21,860
Then he called me back to eat.

390
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:22,860
I really don't understand.

391
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:26,860
I just asked you.

392
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:28,860
I just asked you.

393
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:29,860
Mr. Jia,

394
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:31,860
do you like him?

395
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:33,860
I do.

396
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:36,860
He's always in love.

397
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:37,860
If you have the chance,

398
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:38,860
go to that city.

399
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:43,860
He's such a good man.

400
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:44,860
I'll take you to him.

401
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:47,860
You want me to find her?

402
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:53,860
I've suffered enough for the past three years.

403
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,860
Who suffered?

404
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,860
You even gave her a slap last night.

405
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,860
She asked me to give you a slap.

406
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,860
After the slap, she said she'd give up.

407
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:03,860
But she didn't expect this to happen.

408
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:06,860
She even asked me to the secret room to help her.

409
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,860
Follow me.

410
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:11,860
What's going on?

411
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,860
Hello, Yao Yao Ling.

412
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:15,860
Hello?

413
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:17,860
What's the matter?

414
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:18,860
Is it your call?

415
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:19,860
Yes.

416
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:20,860
Is it your call?

417
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:21,860
Xu Tian.

418
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:23,860
No, it's nothing.

419
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:25,860
I was just chasing after her.

420
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:26,860
I'll handle it myself.

421
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,860
Don't make any unnecessary changes.

422
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:36,860
You want me to find her?

423
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:38,860
I want to find her, too.

424
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,860
I'll handle it myself.

425
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:15,860
I'll handle it myself.

426
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,860
I'll handle it myself.

427
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:15,860
Jia Xiaoxiao is working here.

428
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:16,860
I know.

429
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:20,860
She's the most normal person when she's doing NPC.

430
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:22,860
The secret room.

431
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:24,860
I booked a VIP room.

432
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:25,860
We're the ones who treat her.

433
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:27,860
We'll talk about the three-side and six-side.

434
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,860
We'll talk about it.

435
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:30,860
How?

436
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:32,860
Don't be angry.

437
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:33,860
Don't be sad.

438
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,860
We'll talk about it.

439
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,860
We'll talk about it.

440
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:53,860
We'll talk about it.

441
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:55,860
You talk about Jia Xiaoxiao.

442
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:56,860
How about you?

443
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:59,860
I talk about the real person.

444
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:00,860
I'm telling you.

445
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:03,860
Why are you still scolding people?

446
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:07,860
Do you think she's a dream girl?

447
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,860
A dream girl?

448
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:12,860
It was a group photo.

449
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,860
She didn't leave for three months when she was pregnant.

450
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:16,860
She got pregnant.

451
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:20,860
That's a joke.

452
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:24,860
I'm actually more far from a fight.

453
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:27,860
I can't live without him.

454
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:29,860
I'm normal.

455
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:30,860
I'm normal.

456
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:31,860
I'm normal.

457
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:32,860
I'm normal.

458
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:33,860
I don't ask why she's not reasonable.

459
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:35,860
I'm quite strong.

460
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:37,860
After a week,

461
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:38,860
I've made new girlfriend.

462
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,420
I'm going to call my new girlfriend.

463
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:41,380
She's a good girl.

464
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,060
She's forcing me to break up with her.

465
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:44,580
I can't afford to let her go.

466
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:46,620
She's been turning her face again for half a month.

467
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,260
She's even violent.

468
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,460
She's just hitting people.

469
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,020
I'll call her right away.

470
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,380
She's calling me too.

471
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:54,660
You saw that mouth of hers?

472
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:55,860
That ring.

473
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:00,660
You two really look like each other.

474
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:03,860
What does that mean,

475
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:05,860
to be on the same team as us?

476
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:07,860
Come here.

477
00:39:08,860 --> 00:39:09,860
What's up?

478
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:10,860
Sit here.

479
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:12,860
See if you can see better.

480
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:16,860
What's up?

481
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,860
I didn't recognize her because I wanted to stop her.

482
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:22,860
It's been a year.

483
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:23,860
It's been all over.

484
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:25,860
How late is this?

485
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:26,860
Look.

486
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:37,180
Get over here, guys.

487
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:42,100
ï¿½ï¿½

488
00:39:51,860 --> 00:39:53,060
Why did you hit my boyfriend's car?

489
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:54,540
What kind of girl is that?

490
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,860
I forgot where you mentioned this.

491
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:05,660
All right.

492
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,260
You haven't contacted me for half a year.

493
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:09,860
How could you have our apartment key?

494
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:13,260
You even washed the dishes after eating in the room.

495
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:15,460
I won't do that.

496
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:17,860
Listen to me.

497
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:19,260
My girlfriend is a fan.

498
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:21,060
She bought this car for me.

499
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:21,860
She sent it to me.

500
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,460
Now she wants to send me a knife.

501
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,060
I'll explain to her.

502
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:25,860
Okay.

503
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:26,860
That's all.

504
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:28,860
I'll take the medical record.

505
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,860
After the visit, she just came in.

506
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,460
She apologize to me.

507
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,960
You are a fan.

508
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,060
To tell her not to send me,

509
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:43,460
you have to pay attention to her.

510
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:44,660
You!

511
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:49,680
Jingya,

512
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:54,260
do you take this smudge case?

513
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:55,960
That's not possible.

514
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:58,860
Thanks to you,

515
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,460
I can fix your divorce work.

516
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:04,760
Don't worry.

517
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,640
Sometimes, we have problems

518
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,440
Sometimes, we have problems

519
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,540
Free of charge

520
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:16,540
What?

521
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:20,820
Stop

522
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:22,620
It's no use

523
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:25,720
Please

524
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:30,440
We have almost made a hit

525
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,640
or a failure

526
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:32,940
You don't have to

527
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:33,840
Help me

528
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,840
I'll pay you back two times.

529
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:41,840
Then I'll explain to your girlfriend.

530
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:47,840
Then I'll pay you back 100 times.

531
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,840
I'm sick.

532
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:54,840
Okay, I'm sick.

533
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,840
You're so mean.

534
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:06,840
I'll pay you back 100 times.

535
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:09,840
I'll pay you back 100 times.

536
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,840
You're normal, aren't you?

537
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:15,840
Don't talk to him.

538
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,840
I'm normal.

539
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:21,840
You're a girl.

540
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,840
You've been exposed to auntie.

541
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,840
She said she felt like you two are the same person.

542
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:29,840
You're her, she's you.

543
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,840
You should be careful.

544
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,840
You must have someone to remember her.

545
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:38,840
Or I won't be able to get over her.

546
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,840
What did you say?

547
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:49,840
You're a stranger.

548
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:51,840
You're not a stranger.

549
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:54,840
I'll go in myself.

550
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:56,840
Don't.

551
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:59,840
I must bless you two to be together.

552
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:01,840
I'll go in.

553
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,840
I don't want to see her.

554
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:07,840
You know the situation.

555
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:10,840
Don't be a stranger.

556
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:12,840
Don't be a lover.

557
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:14,840
She's in a bad mood.

558
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,840
She'll be at the bottom of the water.

559
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:19,840
It's better to do what happened last night.

560
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:20,840
She can't do anything.

561
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:22,840
She'll forget you.

562
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,840
It's okay, I'll remember her.

563
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:26,840
How long?

564
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:28,840
Long time.

565
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:31,840
Why?

566
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:36,840
Because I've decided to be alone with her.

567
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,840
I've thought so too.

568
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,840
Now I just want to get rid of her.

569
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:47,840
Get rid of her?

570
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,840
She wants to get rid of me?

571
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:50,840
Or she'll do that?

572
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:56,840
What's wrong with you?

573
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:58,840
I'm here to help you.

574
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:00,840
Where's Sheng?

575
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:03,840
No. 30.

576
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:25,840
I'm here to help you.

577
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:27,840
Sheng.

578
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:29,840
Sheng.

579
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:31,840
Sheng.

580
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:33,840
Sheng.

581
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:35,840
Sheng.

582
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:36,840
Sheng.

583
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:37,840
Sheng.

584
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:38,840
Sheng.

585
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:39,840
Sheng.

586
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:40,840
Sheng.

587
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:41,840
Sheng.

588
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:42,840
Sheng.

589
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:43,840
Sheng.

590
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:44,840
Sheng.

591
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:45,840
Sheng.

592
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:46,840
Sheng.

593
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:47,840
Sheng.

594
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:48,840
Sheng.

595
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:49,840
Sheng.

596
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:50,840
Sheng.

597
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:51,840
Sheng.

598
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:52,840
Sheng.

599
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:53,840
Sheng.

600
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:55,840
Sheng.

601
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:57,840
Sheng.

602
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,840
She's waiting inside.

603
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:24,840
Sheng.

604
00:45:51,840 --> 00:45:52,840
What's wrong?

605
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:55,840
Nothing.

606
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:57,840
It's nothing.

607
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:25,840
Security guard, security guard.

608
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:26,840
Pan Yan.

609
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:27,840
She's your horse.

610
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:30,840
The task is to climb the top.

611
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:32,840
Without the half-dress.

612
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:33,840
After wearing it,

613
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:34,840
we'll let each other know the character.

614
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:36,840
After finishing the dark,

615
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:38,840
it's her most normal time.

616
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:28,840
The snow has turned cold.

617
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:33,840
The stairs are two floors.

618
00:47:34,840 --> 00:47:39,840
The left side is full of dust.

619
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:43,840
The people on the platform

620
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:49,840
can't wait.

621
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:54,840
Sheng.

622
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:56,040
Sheng.

623
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:56,840
Sheng.

624
00:47:56,840 --> 00:47:57,840
Sheng.

625
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:58,840
Sheng.

626
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:01,840
Sheng.

627
00:48:01,840 --> 00:48:02,840
Sheng.

628
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:03,840
Sheng.

629
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:04,840
Sheng.

630
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:05,840
Sheng.

631
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:06,840
Sheng.

632
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:07,840
Sheng.

633
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:09,840
ÑÐ².

634
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:13,840
when Zhezhu's here,

635
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:14,840
you mustn't forget anything.

636
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:17,840
Sheng.

637
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:18,840
Sheng.

638
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:19,840
Sheng.

639
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:20,840
Sheng.

640
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:31,240
In every ending, I will always be your lost and found

641
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:40,160
The strong dusk, the only remaining rain

642
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:49,480
The people in the crowd, the people outside the story

643
00:48:51,600 --> 00:49:00,600
Kneel and argue, don't remain calm

644
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:11,280
The person that I have just decided to miss

645
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:18,080
In every war, it's what keep on going

646
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:24,080
I'm always here, round and round, in every ending

647
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:31,080
I will always be your last one

648
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:38,080
I will always be your last one

649
00:49:38,080 --> 00:49:44,080
I will always be your last one

650
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:52,080
I will always be your last one
