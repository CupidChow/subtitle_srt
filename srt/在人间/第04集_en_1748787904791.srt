Acoustic Lyrics

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,000
You will look for me

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Will you look for me?

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,000
To find a place in the same place

5
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Find a broken place

6
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:03,000
When I leave

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Will you look for me

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:16,000
I have been through the anxiety

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:27,000
The corner of my hands

10
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The place meant to be

11
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,000
The place meant to be

12
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The place meant to be

13
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,000
The place meant to be

14
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The place meant to be

15
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,360
March single promotion

16
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:44,620
We're home

17
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
How do you know I'm going home?

18
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,880
Are you sure you're not going home?

19
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,600
Don't worry. Just drive slowly.

20
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,400
When are you going to record me?

21
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,640
What?

22
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,840
I just recorded you. There was a woman driving.

23
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,840
Don't move.

24
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,800
Say whatever you like.

25
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,840
Do whatever you want.

26
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,120
If you don't want to say it, then it's all fake.

27
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,920
But if you say it, then it's fake.

28
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,960
Brother.

29
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,800
I'm calling you.

30
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,840
Work in the daytime.

31
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,840
Do your work at the fire station at night.

32
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,840
I don't drive.

33
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,840
On weekends, I'll do my work on the subway.

34
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,840
Except for working on the subway, what else do you do?

35
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,840
Go home and play games.

36
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,080
Go home and play games.

37
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,080
Work in the daytime.

38
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:18,080
How can I not count on you?

39
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:20,080
Do you always have any ideas?

40
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:22,080
All kinds of ideas.

41
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:24,080
I have ideas.

42
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,080
Uncle.

43
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,080
Except for dating, what else do you have?

44
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,080
Don't tell me this.

45
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,080
What's the point?

46
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,160
I want to drive a car on the road.

47
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,160
I have a car.

48
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,280
I don't have anyone on the road.

49
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,280
When I'm driving a car on the road,

50
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,840
it's snowing on the ground.

51
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,840
When I'm driving a car up the road,

52
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,840
no one comes with me.

53
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,400
Are you trying to fly?

54
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:59,280
I'm trying to fly like a mountain.

55
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,280
I'm trying to stand in the middle of the road.

56
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,280
I'm trying to walk on the road.

57
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,280
I'm trying to walk on the road.

58
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,280
When I'm driving a car,

59
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,440
I have nothing to do.

60
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,680
I can't do anything.

61
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:12,520
Anything else?

62
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:14,760
Nothing.

63
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:15,840
Say it.

64
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,680
You're embarrassing me.

65
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,720
Do you have any martial arts master?

66
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,200
You're as powerful as a water bull.

67
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,960
No matter how many people you are,

68
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,760
you're fast.

69
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,080
They're like a cow.

70
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,480
Am I right?

71
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,360
Yes.

72
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,840
You want to be a police officer?

73
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,280
The police will only contact you

74
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,280
and those who don't know the rules.

75
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,240
How do you know?

76
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,640
Am I right?

77
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,000
Yes.

78
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,840
I know what you're thinking.

79
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,920
Why do you take part in this?

80
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,880
Because I know

81
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:07,720
you're the one who's in charge of the police.

82
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,000
You're so annoying.

83
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,440
You like me, right?

84
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,440
Tell me the truth.

85
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:28,720
Tell me.

86
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,240
I really like him.

87
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,560
I like you, too.

88
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,960
He's so small.

89
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,720
He's the top of the top.

90
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,120
Where's Yuting?

91
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,160
I always keep in my mind

92
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,200
these things happen in my sleep.

93
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,840
Otherwise everything will end up

94
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,160
an accident.

95
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,640
It's none of my business.

96
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,680
the

97
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,220
introduction of the

98
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,500
forces.

99
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,040
VERY-FORG is

100
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:56,640
a

101
00:07:56,640 --> 00:08:00,760
favourite coin.

102
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:04,660
It is also obvious that

103
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,780
Alright.

104
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,220
You'd better go.

105
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,160
Why are you here?

106
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:35,660
What do you mean?

107
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,660
What do you mean?

108
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:52,660
If you don't have any money, just let me go.

109
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,660
What money?

110
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:05,660
I'm at the door.

111
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,660
I have something to do. I don't have time to talk to you.

112
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:20,660
Hello?

113
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,660
I'm not reliable.

114
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,660
How can I be reliable?

115
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,660
So don't drive.

116
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,660
Wait for me there.

117
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,660
Come on.

118
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,660
What if I don't?

119
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,660
You have to be more responsible than others.

120
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,660
Did you hear the sound of the disappearing?

121
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,660
I didn't order the food.

122
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,660
I'm not a fake thief.

123
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,660
I'm not a fake thief.

124
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,660
Meng Le, please.

125
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:36,660
Are you bored or used to it?

126
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:38,660
Not at all.

127
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:42,660
Then why?

128
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,660
I want to see the sky.

129
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,660
I'm bored or interested.

130
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,660
Drink it.

131
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,660
I have water in my eyes.

132
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,660
I'm bored.

133
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:14,660
Are you bored or used to it?

134
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,660
Do you want to be used to it?

135
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:17,660
I'm still thinking about it.

136
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:20,660
I have time tonight.

137
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:23,660
What time?

138
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,660
Where are you going?

139
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,660
only Xiao touches me.

140
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,660
Drink too much.

141
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:00,660
No.

142
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:03,660
That man ran into you.

143
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,660
What's wrong?

144
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,660
A man.

145
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,660
Not a woman.

146
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:11,660
He did it on purpose.

147
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,660
What do you want?

148
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,660
I want him to be away from you.

149
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:27,660
The better.

150
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,660
I'll go.

151
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,660
Why didn't you break your arm?

152
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:00,660
NPC.

153
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,660
I'll go.

154
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:10,660
That kind of man shouldn't have appeared on the bus.

155
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,660
It's good that there are only two of us on the bus.

156
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,660
I'll go.

157
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,660
Your ideal.

158
00:19:58,660 --> 00:20:01,660
You think you're a man with a rubber band?

159
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,660
So easy.

160
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:06,660
You're lucky tonight.

161
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,660
Do we have a date?

162
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:12,660
No.

163
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:14,660
Where's my car?

164
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,660
I'm not dating.

165
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:20,660
The first time is the last time.

166
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:25,660
Then who do I love?

167
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:29,660
I'll go.

168
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,660
I want to see how much you love me.

169
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:40,660
If there's music.

170
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:40,660
I'll go.

171
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:10,660
I'll go.

172
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,660
Come on.

173
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,660
I'll run into you.

174
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,660
Why?

175
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,660
I don't know.

176
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:44,660
You think I'm your own man.

177
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:10,660
I'll go.

178
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,660
I'll go.

179
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,660
I'll go.

180
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:40,660
Sorry.

181
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:42,660
I was wrong.

182
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:48,660
Say it or not?

183
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,660
You don't want to say it?

184
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:05,660
I'll go.

185
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,660
I'll go.

186
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,660
I'll go.

187
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:40,660
You're so good.

188
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:42,660
You're like a dream.

189
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:44,660
I've never said that.

190
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,660
I don't like you.

191
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:08,660
I don't like you.

192
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:38,660

The bridge is two floors down

305
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:49,100

319
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:03,100
The road is in the back
