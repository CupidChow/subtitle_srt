A place where my heart is broken

15
00:00:55,880 --> 00:01:02,880
When I'm broken, I'll leave

00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:26,880
The familiar corner

19
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:34,880

Cutie.

30
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,380
Your friend is so brave.

31
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:22,920
She has never tried to betray you.

32
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,320
How dare you act?

33
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,840
I'm at work now.

34
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,840
I'll pick up my boyfriend tonight.

35
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,440
What's the script?

36
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,480
I wrote the script.

37
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,600
I've said it.

38
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,360
What else?

39
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,040
What do you want to hear?

40
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:42,400
It's best to hear it.

41
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,240
I know which part I should keep on writing.

42
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,320
You'll appear if you're in the mood.

43
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,640
If you're not in the mood, pretend to be me.

I'll open my phone.

I'm hungry.

I don't have any money.

54
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,240
I'll buy it for you.

55
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
It begins.

56
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,200

Let's start.

00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Go!

88
00:06:54,200 --> 00:07:08,160

00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:29,080
Will Specific

92
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:35,680
It's not out

93
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,700
Infinity völlig

94
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,600
No

95
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,680
Do you have more cards?

96
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,660

97
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,620

98
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:52,540
Wait.

99
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,660
I'll pay for my phone.

100
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:06,780
Give me a bag.

101
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:19,980
I'll pay for your phone.

102
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,180
This is spicy.

103
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:36,980
The storage is too high.

104
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,220
The storage is almost there.

105
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:41,820
Even if we eat today,

106
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:42,820
it's not very safe.

107
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,060
You bought so many things.

108
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,420
You want to go back and put them in the refrigerator?

109
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,420
When you think about it,

110
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,540
it's already expired.

111
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,540
And this.

00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,180
This is spicy.

113
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:55,660
And it's not good for stomach.

114
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,580
If we eat it together,

115
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,980
it will make our stomach hurt and make us want to go to school.

116
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,180
This is not bought for me.

117
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,580
This is not bought for me.

118
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,220

Who are you?

122
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,020
Why are you so cruel?

123
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:33,620
Does this have anything to do with being cruel?

124
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,260
You like her.

125
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,580

128
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,020
Burning on the ground.

129
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,260

Sure, go in.

136
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,980

143
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,980

Hello, the number you dialed is currently unavailable.

191
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:44,420
Please call again later.

192
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,420
Hello, the number you dialed is currently unavailable.

193
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:14,420
Please call again later.

194
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,420
Hello, the number you dialed is currently unavailable.

195
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:44,420
Please call again later.

196
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:13,420
I figured that you were out of your mind again.

197
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:17,420
If you can't find me, will you be looking for me all along?

198
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,420
Of course, I will.

199
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:24,420
Death is now in our land.

200
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:27,420
That's why I thing someone else can find me.

201
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:36,420
Therefore, I decided that I'd turn right between A Bad and A Bad Nan.

202
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:39,420
If you can't find me, will you keep looking for me?

203
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:41,420
I will definitely keep looking.

204
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,420
How did I end up last time?

205
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,920
Think about it.

206
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,240
By the way,

207
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,640
hold on and tell me about the receipt of data.

208
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,920
Okay.

209
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,980
Great!

210
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,360
Going to the bar now?

211
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,420
I'll ask those men to clean it for you.

212
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,020
Get it quick.

213
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,220
Did you know...

214
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,120
Don't you remember?

215
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,120
I don't care anymore.

216
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,360
That's it?

217
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,120
Fortunately, I'm back now.

218
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,160
What did we say when we came out of the派出所?

219
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:50,560
You said we were in virtual space.

220
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,320
You're the player, I'm the NPC.

221
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,640
You said you were in the virtual space tonight.

222
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,160
You won't be here tomorrow.

223
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,320
And then?

224
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,440
And then...

225
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,760
And then I said you're not here.

226
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,760
I said I'm here.

227
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,760
You told me to shut up.

228
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,600
I didn't.

229
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,520
I said it's okay if you're unhappy

230
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,040
and want to go offline.

231
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,320
I'll be here all the time.

232
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,160
I'll call you.

233
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:20,920
Since you're the NPC,

234
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,520
you'll have no regrets in your life.

235
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,160
And then?

236
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,520
And then you left.

237
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,120
Nothing else?

238
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,520
I can't bear to

239
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,840
let you go.

240
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,320
Even if it's a virtual thing,

241
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,680
don't rush to offline.

242
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:55,680
Just have fun.

243
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,280
Maybe you'll have a good life

244
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:59,680
after playing.

245
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,120
Okay.

246
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,280
Okay.

247
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,000
We're hiding from each other

248
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:14,720
and never go offline.

249
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:18,240
Maybe no one knows

250
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,400
we've been together for a lifetime.

251
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:26,520
Where are we hiding?

252
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,360
Home.

253
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,360
It's still dark.

254
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,800
Where are you?

255
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:52,880
What are you doing?

256
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,840
I came all the way here for fun.

257
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,200
Out of the blue.

258
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,640
What do you mean?

259
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,200
The time's still tight.

260
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:15,480
It wentxi didan.

261
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,480
I'll go.

262
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,480
I've been through three meters.

263
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:25,480
Is it within three meters or outside three meters?

264
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,080
How can it be within three meters?

265
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,680
No matter what, no one talks to me.

266
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:38,080
I don't teach friends. I don't even recommend them to each other.

267
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,480
Just the two of us being together.

268
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,480
After being together,

269
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,480
I don't ask about the past.

270
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,480
I only talk about the future.

271
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,480
I'll stay here for a lifetime.

272
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:55,080
Live here for a lifetime?

273
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:59,480
This city is not in this room.

274
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:08,480
That means we're officially in the same place.

275
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,480
Do you agree?

276
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,480
I definitely agree.

277
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,080
But you really do.

278
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,480
This is my wish.

279
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:23,480
To take you as my own in my heart.

280
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,080
We're just one person.

281
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:31,480
From now on, we'll never leave each other.

282
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:33,480
Fine.

283
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:36,480
I'm the MPZ. I'll be with you.

284
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,480
I'll go wash my blood.

285
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,480
I'll go wash my blood.

286
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,480
So fast.

287
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:12,480
Are you going to wash it?

288
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,480
You...you...you...

289
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:16,480
You...you...

290
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,480
Are there any other people here?

291
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,480
Who else?

292
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,480
I'm looking at the paper on the fridge.

293
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,480
It's not written by one person.

294
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,480
I'm very sleepy.

295
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,480
I can't see anything. I'll go get some water.

296
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,480
Okay.

297
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,480
Are you a sofa or a bed?

298
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,480
You're sleepy.

299
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,480
I'm sleepy again.

300
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,480
I've been sleepy for several lifetimes.

301
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,480
Then I'll sleep on the sofa.

302
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,480
Here.

303
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,480
I'm sleepy.

304
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,480
You should go to the place tomorrow.

305
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,480
What?

306
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,480
Be more formal.

307
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,480
The civil court is getting married.

308
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,480
Are you willing to do that?

309
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,480
You want to sleep, don't you?

310
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,480
But if you don't dare to sleep,

311
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:22,480
you'll be gone in a blink of an eye.

312
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,480
Or I'll be gone in a blink of an eye.

313
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,480
No problem.

314
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,480
You sleep on the sofa.

315
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,480
From now on,

316
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:53,480
it's only temporary.

317
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,480
I promise I'll beínuvelled in thisero.

318
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,480
The first day of the trip

319
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,480

The first day of the trip

341
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,480
The first day of the trip

342
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:54,500
Living in aCL

343
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:58,200

00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:16,700
They said you tried to illegally drive

349
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,160
Hello

350
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,000
You coordinates are graffiti

351
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,640
Forgive me

352
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,300
Give me a call from your mother.

353
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,920
Xu Tian!

354
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:38,020
Xu Tian!

355
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,520
Boring.

356
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,480
Who?

357
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,560
Who?

358
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:57,760
Who?

359
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,000
Me?

360
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,400
It's Tian.

361
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,760
Why did you run

362
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,120
in the middle of the night?

363
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,560
Are you crazy?

364
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,400
Do you want to drag me down?

365
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,120
No.

366
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,240
You've been sleeping all day.

367
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,720
You're sleeping in circles.

368
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:11,720
I can't help but call you.

369
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:14,640
Xiaozuo.

370
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,560
Xiaozuo.

371
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,080
Don't be angry.

372
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,520
I haven't slept for a minute.

373
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:24,120
I've never been so careless.

374
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,800
I'm not sleeping.

375
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,320
We'll be together again.

376
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,720
In the middle of the night,

377
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:33,720
I'll be ready before you wake up.

390
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,680
But the worker still has a long way to go.

391
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,560
He went back to pack his things.

392
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:18,760

393
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:19,800

394
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,080

403
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,920
I've searched for you for a long time.

404
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,360
I don't even know who I am.

405
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,040

406
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:50,960

410
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,960
How much work do I have to do?

411
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,160
We have to be careful.

412
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,200
Do you understand?

413
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,760
I don't understand.

414
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,840
I don't want to understand.

415
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,160
I'll just stay with you.

I'll go find you.

421
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,800
I'm driving.

422
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,880
It's convenient for me to come back.

00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:29,220
We can eat and drink at the same time.

572
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:30,220
It's convenient.

573
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:34,220
We can stay together in the next floor.

574
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:35,220
Okay.

575
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:40,220
We must stay together.

576
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:42,220
Send her out.

577
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:43,220
Send her to the door.

578
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:50,220
We can go to the town hall and the town hall on Monday.

579
00:42:52,220 --> 00:42:53,220
Let's stay together.

580
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:56,220
Of course.

581
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:57,220
I can go there alone.

582
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:17,220
I'm a little impatient.

583
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:21,220
I've transferred all my money to a card.

584
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:25,220
We've been together for two or three years.

585
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:27,220
We have computers at home.

586
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:29,220
We can connect to the power.

587
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:32,220
In two or three years,

588
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:33,220
there must be a government for two or three years.

589
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:36,220
You're responsible for the need for a public health.

590
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:38,220
In two or three years,

591
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:40,220
there will be another two or three years.

592
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:43,220
We'll live a life like this.

593
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,220
We'll live a life like this.

594
00:43:58,220 --> 00:43:59,220
Are you Tian Cheng?

595
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:03,220
Yes.

596
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:06,220
You said that you'll be with me on September 30.

597
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:07,220
On September 30.

598
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:13,220
What's this?

599
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:14,220
It's a pillow.

600
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:33,220
We've done a lot of things in the morning.

601
00:44:33,220 --> 00:44:35,220
This is the most important thing.

602
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:39,220
You've been looking at me for ten years.

603
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:43,220
We don't have to wash our feet and go out.

604
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:47,220
It's our birthday to return the money.

605
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:49,220
We'll have it in a moment.

606
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:56,220
It's mainly my mood.

607
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:04,220
I'm here.

608
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:22,220
Is it an egg?

609
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:27,220
Wait for the week-end.

610
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:31,220
Wait for the week-end.

611
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:36,220
If you cross the bridge again, you'll go back.

612
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:38,220
That's enough.

613
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:40,220
Let's go to the bridge to get this one.

614
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:09,220
If you cross the bridge again, you'll go back.

615
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:12,220
That's enough.

616
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:15,220
Let's go to the bridge to get this one.

617
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:23,220
If you cross the bridge again, you'll go back.

618
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:26,220
That's enough.

619
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:29,220
Let's go to the bridge to get this one.

620
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:33,220
The sun shines on the two sides

621
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:38,220
The two layers of the skin

622
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:44,220
The left side is full of dust

623
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:48,220
The one on the platform

624
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:54,220
Can't wait for the one

625
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:02,220
Don't forget the one on the platform

626
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:06,220
Can't wait for the one on the platform

627
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:10,220
Can't wait for the one on the platform

628
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:17,220
In every world

629
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:22,220
Feel the energy of the wind

630
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:25,220
Round and round

631
00:47:25,220 --> 00:47:27,220
In every ending

632
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:35,220
I will always be your lost and found

633
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:43,220
The dusk of the night, the rain of the day

634
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:53,220
The people in the crowd, the people outside the story

635
00:47:53,940 --> 00:48:04,980
The people who get lost in anguish, such as amyears

636
00:48:06,980 --> 00:48:14,980
Only those which was destined to be lost

637
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:16,980
I'm not sure if I can do it.

638
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:18,980
I'm not sure if I can do it.

639
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:20,980
I'm not sure if I can do it.

640
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:22,980
I'm not sure if I can do it.

00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:26,980
I'm not sure if I can do it.

643
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:28,980
I'm not sure if I can do it.

644
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:30,980
I'm not sure if I can do it.

645
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:32,980

649
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:40,980
I'm not sure if I can do it.

650
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:42,980
I'm not sure if I can do it.

651
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:44,980
I'm not sure if I can do it.

652
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:46,980
I'm not sure if I can do it.

653
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:48,980
I'm not sure if I can do it.

654
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:50,980
I'm not sure if I can do it.

655
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:52,980
I'm not sure if I can do it.
