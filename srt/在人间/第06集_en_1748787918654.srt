1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,400
Cute

2
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,880
I'm leaving

3
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:31,760
I leave with you

4
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,560
Will you look for me?

5
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:39,440
Will you look for me?

6
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,680
To find a place in the same place

7
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:53,320
Find a place where you can be broken

8
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:01,320
When I leave with you

9
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:07,320
Will you look for me?

10
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:14,320
I have been through the familiar corner of the past

11
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:20,320
The familiar corner of the past

12
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:28,320
The place meant to be

13
00:01:50,320 --> 00:02:03,320
The place meant to be

14
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:06,320
Episode 13

15
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,320
Let's meet again next week

16
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,320
Thank you

17
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,320
I won't come back

18
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,320
See you next week

19
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,320
I'll take you there

20
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,320
Let's go

21
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,320
Hurry up

22
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,320
Come with me

23
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,320
Come with me

24
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,320
I'm sorry

25
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:25,320
I'm sorry

26
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,320
Come with me

27
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:22,320
Come with me

28
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,320
Where are you?

29
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,320
Drive

30
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,320
Come and pick me up

31
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,320
Come now

32
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,320
I'm leaving

33
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,320
Come with me

34
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,320
I'm leaving

35
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,320
I'm leaving

36
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:18,320
I'm leaving

37
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,320
I'm leaving

38
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,320
Hello

39
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,320
Yutian

40
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,320
Come and pick me up

41
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,320
I'm a doctor

42
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,320
The medicine for the late night

43
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,320
You need to take it

44
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,320
Yutian

45
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,320
Yutian

46
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,320
Yutian

47
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,320
Yutian

48
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,320
Yutian

49
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,320
Yutian

50
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:48,320
Come and take the medicine

51
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,320
Is he a doctor?

52
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,320
He's off work

53
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,320
Who am I?

54
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,320
Take the medicine

55
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,320
You don't say I don't take it

56
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,320
Listen

57
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,320
Who is the doctor who will tell you?

58
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,320
You've always been a fake, right?

59
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:35,320
It's been a fake for three years, right?

60
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,320
Take the medicine

61
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,320
I want to see the doctor

62
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,320
I'll see him right away

63
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:50,320
The doctor needs an appointment

64
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,320
After 8 hours of my appointment

65
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,320
I'll be there at 8.30 tomorrow morning

66
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,320
I'll ask him when he's off work

67
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,320
I'll be there at 8.30 tomorrow morning

68
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,320
The doctor won't be off work tomorrow

69
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,320
I'll be there at 8.30 tomorrow morning

70
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,920
ACK

71
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,640
But not me

72
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,440
But even if we go to another door

73
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,080
You won't be Patty

74
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,480
Don't push

75
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,280
But only James

76
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,680
Don't do anything

77
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,720
Just stay somewhere

78
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,560
跟你

79
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,720
avons

80
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,040
Hand cut

81
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,600
Driven with Advance

82
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:39,560
Take this

83
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:40,960
It just keeps flashing

84
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:42,120
Hand cut

85
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,320
It looks good.

86
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,320
Very good.

87
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,320
It's like a fake one.

88
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,320
The water pipe is enough.

89
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,320
Let's go.

90
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,320
The water pipe is enough.

91
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,320
The water pipe is enough.

92
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,320
The water pipe is enough.

93
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,320
The water pipe is enough.

94
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,320
The water pipe is enough.

95
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,320
The water pipe is enough.

96
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,320
The water pipe is enough.

97
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,320
The water pipe is enough.

98
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,320
Excuse me.

99
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,320
Please don't take the time to have breakfast.

100
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,320
I should let them bring you here slowly.

101
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,320
What's wrong?

102
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,320
There's no mirror in your room.

103
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,320
This is a treatment room.

104
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,320
You never look at yourself?

105
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,320
I know who I am.

106
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,320
Sorry.

107
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,320
I think it through.

108
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,320
I'm Xiaoduo.

109
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,320
Very good.

110
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,320
Please sit.

111
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,320
Didn't you sleep well last night?

112
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,320
I slept well.

113
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,320
I saw a lot of books.

114
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,320
There are only Xiaoduo's books.

115
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,320
Can I ask you a question?

116
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,320
Go ahead.

117
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,320
Did you make the test room for the company?

118
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,320
I was the one who did the test room.

119
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,320
Right?

120
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,320
Why are you here?

121
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,320
When you entered Cui Mian,

122
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,320
you would consider me as a test room in a virtual space.

123
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,320
These four are your four women's songs.

124
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,320
One is the model man, Wang Yangming,

125
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,320
and the other is the doctor.

126
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,320
Six of them are the sisters.

127
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:05,320
This is the first time that the iron bell appeared in the outside world.

128
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,320
After a month of treatment,

129
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,320
we have successfully solved the problem.

130
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,320
The model man, the fish egg, and the body woman.

131
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:21,320
Now these three are no longer bothering us.

132
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,320
They are bothering you too?

133
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,320
Yes.

134
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,320
Now we are on the iron bell.

135
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,320
I remember every time I saw them,

136
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,320
they started from that bed.

137
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,320
Is that bed?

138
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,320
Why is the model man's name not there?

139
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:05,320
Maybe he is Wang Yangming.

140
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,320
You will mention this name sometime.

141
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,320
He is another love model you want to be.

142
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:16,320
But now he is not even a complete woman.

143
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,320
Another love model?

144
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,320
Xu Tian loves you in your fantasy.

145
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,320
You want to be another love model

146
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,320
to increase Xu Tian's love for you.

147
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,320
I imagined Xu Tian too.

148
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,320
We have already made a mistake.

149
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,320
No.

150
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,320
Didn't you say that he died in the hypnotic?

151
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,320
I don't want to make a mistake.

152
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,320
Let's start.

153
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,320
You are great.

154
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,320
We have already taken three people's leave.

155
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,320
We are left with the iron bell.

156
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,320
How can we send him away?

157
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,320
We have to face it ourselves.

158
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,320
Send him away.

159
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,320
I don't know what happened to him.

160
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,320
How can we face it?

161
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,320
After the iron bell was lost,

162
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,320
the most clear memory was that he loved his father.

163
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,320
He loved him almost every day.

164
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,320
But his mother never cared.

165
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,320
He never advised her when he was fighting.

166
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,320
He never comforted her after the fight.

167
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,320
In the spring of 2008,

168
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:38,320
he was so upset that he didn't love him anymore.

169
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,320
The next day,

170
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,320
he lost a watch at home.

171
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,320
That was the only thing that he kept at home.

172
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,320
I thought that iron bell stole him.

173
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,320
So I took it to exchange money.

174
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:52,320
I didn't ask him.

175
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,320
I just didn't talk to him anymore.

176
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,320
I didn't use my hands.

177
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:59,320
I didn't use my hands to touch his hair.

178
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,320
He told you that?

179
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,320
He told me when he was in the iron bell.

180
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,320
It was like this.

181
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,320
In the spring of 2010,

182
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,320
my mother went to the department to wash her clothes.

183
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,320
She was found in the pocket of an old clothes bag.

184
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,320
That day,

185
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,320
my mother wanted to put her hand back

186
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,320
and put her hair back on her.

187
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,320
She hid it and left.

188
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,320
She didn't want to take it back.

189
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,320
But in the winter,

190
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,320
my mother passed away.

191
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,320
She never went back to her hometown.

192
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,320
I never remember these things.

193
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,320
Do you feel sad?

194
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,320
Sometimes.

195
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,320
When you were in the iron bell,

196
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,320
you felt more.

197
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,320
What would you do after you were sent away?

198
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,320
Your body

199
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,320
only had a small part left.

200
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,320
Will you be lonely?

201
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,320
If you keep your heart like this,

202
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,320
everyone will be lonely.

203
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,320
Come on.

204
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,320
Go to the iron bell.

205
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,320
Go.

206
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,320
What do I do?

207
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,320
You just need to close your eyes

208
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,320
and then breathe.

209
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:09,320
Breathe slowly.

210
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,320
Why do I have your number?

211
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:20,320
When you are not Xu Tian,

212
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:23,320
you will need a call from his brother.

213
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:25,320
I'll leave it to you.

214
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,320
It's your idea to send Xu Tian away.

215
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,320
It's also your idea.

216
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,320
How is that possible?

217
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,320
I can't bear to leave him.

218
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,320
You must bear it even if you can't.

219
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,320
He needs you too.

220
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,320
How do you know?

221
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,320
Now, close your eyes.

222
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,320
Breathe.

223
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,320
Breathe slowly.

224
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:11,320
Now, you only have a little part left in your mind.

225
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,320
Only when you meet each other again,

226
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,320
will you be like him.

227
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,320
Why do I have Xu Tian's number?

228
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,320
Breathe.

229
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,320
Where is Xu Tian's number?

230
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,320
Breathe.

231
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,320
Breathe slowly.

232
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,320
Close your eyes.

233
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,320
Breathe.

234
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,320
Breathe.

235
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,320
Did you see that?

236
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:19,320
Did you see that?

237
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,320
What's wrong?

238
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,320
What's wrong?

239
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,320
What's wrong?

240
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,320
What's wrong?

241
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:48,320
You are violent.

242
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,320
You are violent.

243
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,320
Let go of me.

244
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:53,320
Calm down.

245
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,320
Who are you?

246
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:00,320
I'm a guest.

247
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,320
I can see him on the big stage.

248
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,320
I'll be right back.

249
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,320
Let's go.

250
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,320
I'm a guest.

251
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,320
Let's take a look.

252
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,320
Are you the police?

253
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,320
I am.

254
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,320
What's wrong with your brain?

255
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,320
They broke the door.

256
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,320
They broke my heart.

257
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,320
Can you use your shoulder?

258
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,320
No.

259
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,320
I'm a guest.

260
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,320

261
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,320

I'm a guest.

266
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,320
I'm a guest.

267
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,320

I'm a guest.

288
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,320
I'm a guest.

289
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,320
Why is the door broken?

290
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:16,320
It's wrong.

291
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,320
Is the head of the glass broken?

292
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,320
He broke it himself.

293
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,320
You broke it yourself?

294
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,320
You're a mute.

295
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:28,320
A mute?

296
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,320
I'm a mute.

297
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,320

I'm a mute.

310
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,320
I'm a mute.

311
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,320
You...

312
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,320
Are you willing to reconcile?

313
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,320
What's wrong with the stage?

314
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,320
Are you willing to reconcile?

315
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,320

Get off.

345
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,320

00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,320
Six thousand?

385
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:26,320
At least eight.

386
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,320
What's going on?

387
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,320
What's going on?

388
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,320
What's going on?

389
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,320
How many stock exchange numbers do we have?

390
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,320
By Ben Yan.

391
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,320
You said ten thousand?

392
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,320
By Ben Yan.

393
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,320
I want to apologize.

394
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,320
That's impossible.

395
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,320
Fine. I'm sorry.

396
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,320
Tell him.

397
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,320
I'm sorry.

398
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,320
Eight hundred is the money I pay you.

399
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,320
One hundred is a apology.

400
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,320
One hundred is a thousand.

401
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,320
Say it again.

402
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,320
Louder.

403
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,320
Louder.

404
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,320
Nine hundred is enough.

405
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:25,320
Then one point is not enough.

406
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,320
Go to the police station to solve it.

407
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,320
Okay.

408
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,320
Comrade.

409
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,320
Stay away from the car.

410
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,320
I'm his sister.

411
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,320
His sister?

412
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,320
The one in the car.

413
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,320
Tell your brother.

414
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,320
There's nothing wrong.

415
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:48,320
He broke his head.

416
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,320
He went to the hospital to sell this car.

417
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,320
Why is there nothing wrong?

418
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,320
Do you want money?

419
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,320
There's one more thing.

420
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,320
The police is here.

421
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,320
Don't lie.

422
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,320
Louder.

423
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:07,320
I'm sorry.

424
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,320
I can't take it.

425
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,320
I'm sorry.

426
00:37:13,320 --> 00:37:14,320
I've wronged you.

427
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,320
Give me money.

428
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,320
Did you break your head?

429
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:22,320
Yes.

430
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,320
Can I leave now?

431
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,320
Did you break your head?

432
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,320
Yes.

433
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,320
Let's go.

434
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:45,320
Go.

435
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,320
Give me one thousand dollars.

436
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,320
I'll pay you right away.

437
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,320
Go get it.

438
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,320
Do you have a card?

439
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,320
Come on.

440
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,320
I'll go find a free ticket.

441
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,320
Are you a mute?

442
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,320
Yes.

443
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,320
I'll pay you right away.

444
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,320
Go.

445
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,320
Go.

446
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,320
Give me money.

447
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,320
You can't do anything.

448
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,320
Money team, do you think it's that important?

449
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,320
Hurry up.

450
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,320
Go away.

451
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,320
You can talk.

452
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,320
I have something important to tell you.

453
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,320
Tell me how to do it.

454
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,320
Then you can learn it.

455
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,320
Go away.

456
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:45,320
Go away.

457
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,320
What are you doing?

458
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,320
You were born on September 30,

459
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,320
you are a natural.

460
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,320
Me too.

461
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,320
What's the use of money?

462
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,320
I don't know.

463
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,320
How much can you earn?

464
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,320
I'm gone.

465
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,320
I'm leaving.

466
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,320
Who's the use of money?

467
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,320
Disappear.

468
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,320
Be careful.

469
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,320
Disappear.

470
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,320
Go away.

471
00:43:49,320 --> 00:43:50,320
Disappear.

472
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,320
You are completely gone.

473
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:54,320
Why did you go there?

474
00:43:55,320 --> 00:43:56,320
You are a man.

475
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,320
Don't go.

476
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,320
If you don't go,

477
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:01,320
your mother might still be there.

478
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,320
She is a man.

479
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:05,320
Am I right?

480
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:09,320
Who are you looking at?

481
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,320
I'm a man.

482
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:14,320
You are too late.

483
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,320
I'm afraid of you.

484
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,320
Kill me.

485
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:18,320
Hurry up.

486
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,320
I need to go to the heaven.

487
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,320
Hurry up.

488
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:23,320
I need to go to the heaven.

489
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:44,320
Go.

490
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:15,320
Go.

491
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:44,320
Go.

492
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:14,320
Go.

493
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:44,320
Go.

494
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:14,320
Go.

495
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:44,320
Go.

496
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:14,320
Go.

497
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,320
Go.

498
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:14,320
Go.

499
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:44,320
Go.

500
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:14,320
Take a photo for us.

501
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:31,320
It's rare.

502
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:44,320
It's rare.

503
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:44,320
It's rare.

504
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,320
It's rare.

505
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:44,320
I'm a man.

506
00:53:13,320 --> 00:53:14,320
I'm a man.

507
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:15,320
You are too late.

508
00:53:15,320 --> 00:53:16,320
I'm afraid of you.

509
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:18,320
I'm afraid of you.

510
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:20,320
I'm afraid of you.

511
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:22,320
I'm afraid of you.

512
00:53:23,320 --> 00:53:24,320
I'm afraid of you.

513
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:26,320
I'm afraid of you.

514
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:28,320
I'm afraid of you.

515
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:30,320
I'm afraid of you.

516
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:32,320
I'm afraid of you.

517
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:34,320
I'm afraid of you.

518
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:36,320
I'm afraid of you.

519
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:38,320
I'm afraid of you.

520
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:40,320
I'm afraid of you.

521
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:42,320
I'm afraid of you.

522
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:45,320
I'm afraid of you.

523
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:47,320
I'm afraid of you.

524
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:50,320
Imagine this!

525
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:53,320
I'm afraid of you.

526
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:55,320
I'm afraid of you.

527
00:53:59,320 --> 00:54:00,320
I'm afraid of you.

528
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:02,320
I'm afraid of you.

529
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:03,320
I'm afraid of you.

530
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:05,320
I'm afraid of you.

531
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:07,320
Imagine this!
