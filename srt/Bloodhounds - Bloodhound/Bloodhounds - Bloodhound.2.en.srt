00:00:18,935 --> 00:00:20,186
I need painkillers.

3
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,189
- Please help my mom.
- We'll get to her soon.

4
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:24,691
Are you sure?

5
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:25,608
Come in.

6
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:27,986
- She can't move her face.
- Just wait.

7
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:30,613
- Can someone help her?
- We'll get to her soon.

8
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,616
Coming through.

9
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,743
Coming through here.

00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:38,830
Doctor, please…

12
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:40,707
Out of the way!

13
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,959
Out of the way! He's crashing here!

14
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,670
- Stay with me.
- Open your eyes!

15
00:00:45,754 --> 00:00:46,755
Come on!

16
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,237
- Thank you.
- Sure.

17
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,157
What's your blood type?

18
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,536
Blood pressure 80/50.

19
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:20,288
Mom.

20
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:30,381
Oh…

21
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:38,389
- I'm sorry.
- No, no.

22
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:39,724
You're fine.

23
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:46,773
Let's go.

KANGBUK SAMSUNG HOSPITAL

26
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,112
- Mr. An Mun-ju?
- Yes.

27
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,579
You're lucky
there wasn't any nerve damage.

28
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,832
We can help with the scar, you know?

29
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:47,959
Now that the would is all sealed up,

30
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:51,880
we can do a procedure
that will keep it from scarring too badly.

31
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:53,590
Will it be expensive?

32
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,425
It can be pricey, yes.

33
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:59,637
Let me show you a photo
of a recent procedure.

34
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,974
- See the scar there?
- Yeah.

35
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:05,018
This is the before photo.

36
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:08,396
- And this is after the laser treatment.
- Oh.

37
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:10,773
It's your face. You're young.

38
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,568
It would be wise to look into it,
in my opinion.

39
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,614
It's okay. I'll be fine.
Thank you so much.

40
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:21,576
Mr. Choi Han-seon?

41
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:23,578
Come on in.

42
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:24,621
Hey.

43
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:29,667
You okay?

44
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,504
- Show me.
- No.

45
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:34,589
Show me.

46
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:43,348
Oh God.

47
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:48,269
How many stitches?

48
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:50,146
Thirty.

49
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,691
Those motherfuckers.
How do we get back at them?

50
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:57,028
The cops?

51
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:03,409
Call the cops,
and your mom's dead.

52
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:10,083
- We can't.
- Why's that?

53
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,668
He said they'll kill my mom.

54
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:15,171
Shit.

55
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,548
Wait, the contract.

56
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:20,051
Right.

57
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:21,511
Here.

58
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,222
There's a "loan extension fee" in it.

59
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:28,768
You have to pay 10% of the principal
every single week.

60
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,813
Your mom took fifty million,
so the fee is five.

61
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:35,358
But if you miss a payment,
the fee doubles,

62
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,819
and the interest jumps to 20%.

63
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:40,363
Assholes wrote it in fine print
so no one sees it.

64
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,366
It's a con. Your mom didn't know.

65
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:45,076
What do I do?

66
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,744
You have to pay it all back.

67
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,414
She used your home as collateral.

68
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:52,166
We're fucked.

69
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,628
Damn it.

70
00:05:03,219 --> 00:05:06,180
Let's go eat. On me, What do you want?

71
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:10,393
Rib eye.

72
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:12,645
Oh, come on.

73
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:13,688
Are you joking?

74
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,773
No, I want rib eye.

75
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,026
All right.

76
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,738
Spicy stir-fried pork
is as good as rib eye.

77
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:24,907
I'll take it.

78
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:28,786
I always come here after a workout.

79
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,956
It's my routine. Kinda perfect,
so don't ruin it for me, okay?

80
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,333
Just be quiet and eat your food.

81
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,043
- Understood?
- Understood.

82
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:37,086
- There she is!
- Hello.

83
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,213
Hello. Hi.

84
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:40,298
How are you, dear?

85
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:42,008
- Two spicy porks, please.
- Oh, of course.

86
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,426
And you brought a friend with you.

87
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,094
- Hello.
- He boxes with me.

88
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:46,179
That's great.

89
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:52,977
I need to take this.

90
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:53,895
Okay.

91
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:57,315
Hey, hey. Yeah, this is Woo-jin

92
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:58,691
How are you?

93
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:01,486
Uh, well, the thing is…

94
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,952
MY SON

95
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:12,497
Hi, Gun-woo.

96
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,916
Hey, mom. Woo-jin looked at the contract.

97
00:06:14,999 --> 00:06:16,751
Apparently, these guys are con men.

98
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:18,002
They tricked you into signing.

99
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,046
None of it's your fault, Mom.

100
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:21,381
Thank you, son.

101
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:25,968
What did they…
What did they say about your face?

102
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:28,429
Hm. They said it will be fine.

103
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,348
Oh, thank goodness.

104
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,518
And I'll clean up everything with Woo-jin.

105
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:35,103
You should stay home and rest, okay?

106
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:40,608
No, no, no. Don't do anything.
I'll go clean up.

107
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:43,653
It's fine. I'll do it
on my way back home, hm?

108
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,238
Your food is ready.

109
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:51,828
Mom, I'll have to call you back
in a little bit, okay?

110
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,663
- Oh, all right.
- Mm-hm.

111
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,964
Come on.
Just help me out this one time.

112
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:04,841
It's not for me. It's for a friend.

113
00:07:05,842 --> 00:07:08,928
You know I'll pay it all back on time.
There won't be an issue.

114
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:12,723
Jesus, we can get a second-tier loan
from anywhere.

115
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,560
Please give me a first-tier loan.

116
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,937
I am seriously, seriously begging you.

117
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,481
Because I care about this kid, man.

118
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:25,278
Remember how many loan payments
I collected for you back in the day?

119
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,281
You owe me, man. Come on.

120
00:07:58,019 --> 00:07:59,979
Whoa, you should have got me.

121
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,940
- It just came out.
- Dig in.

122
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:06,068
- The best spicy pork in all of Korea.
- Oh.

123
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,619
- Right? Let's eat.
- Mm.

124
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,925
LET'S TALK AT THE OFFICE

125
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,135
He has a quick temper.

126
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,512
Keep your head down.

127
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:34,222
- I'll do the talking.
- Okay.

128
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,560
- Mr. Seo.
- Yes?

129
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:40,811
How much is this?

130
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,397
It's worth 20 million.

131
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:45,691
Come on, bro. Woo-jin is here.

132
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,070
You got some nerve dropping off the grid,

133
00:08:49,153 --> 00:08:52,073
then coming here to ask me for money, huh?

134
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:54,575
Come on,
what do you have to say to me, huh?

135
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:58,037
- I'm… sorry, okay? You look good.
- Let go of me.

136
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,873
You little shit.

137
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,333
- Sit.
- Hey, sit.

138
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,251
Okay.

139
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:09,257
All right.

140
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:11,551
So how'd you get in debt?

141
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:14,637
Some thugs got him. Smile Capital.

142
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:18,057
Smile Capital? In Gwangan-dong?

143
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,101
I'm not really sure.

144
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:22,228
Oh shit.

145
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:26,023
Yeah, Smile Capital isn't just
a bunch of goons.

146
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,275
They're a huge company.

147
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,360
How much was it?

148
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:30,820
A hundred.

149
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:37,076
You're screwed, huh?

150
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:40,580
Yeah, exactly, so help him out, man.
You got enough money.

151
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,752
Here's a first-tier loan
of 100 million.

152
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:51,090
Wow! Thanks so much.

153
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:55,636
In exchange, you'll do some work for me.

154
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:58,848
Thanks to COVID, business is booming.

155
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,183
Let's strike while the iron's hot
and make some real money.

156
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:03,060
Just help me out,

157
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:06,480
and I'll throw in a bonus
for each collection.

158
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:10,443
Uh… I don't know.

159
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:11,652
Jesus.

160
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:13,696
Just work as a bloodhound for one year.

161
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:17,033
Listen, this is a real opportunity.

162
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:19,410
You two can make some big money here.

163
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:22,872
What other options do you have
to make this much?

164
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,540
I know you're right.

165
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,584
- Come on.
- It's just a bit unexpected.

166
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,046
- Come on, give me an answer.
- Hey, we should go.

167
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:32,048
Huh?

168
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,383
Don't these runs involve
beating people up?

169
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,846
If you prey on the weak for money,
you're a thug.

170
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:41,349
We're boxers.

171
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:44,894
Okay, listen here.

172
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,606
Smile Capital will kill you
if you don't pay them back.

173
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:50,274
They're gonna sell your organs.

174
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,579
The hell?

175
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:06,499
Bro, thanks so much, but we can't.

176
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,794
Come on, let's go. Yeah, go on.

177
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,504
What are you trying to do here?

178
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,216
Let go of me.

179
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,018
I'm just kidding.

180
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,688
See ya.

181
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:32,483
Hey, let's go.

182
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:37,905
Goddammit!

183
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:40,366
Hey, boxer.

184
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,874
- Stamp it.
- Okay.

185
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:52,628
Once your business takes off,
give us a cut, okay?

186
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:56,132
Oh, thank you. Thank you so much.

187
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,930
- Great work.
- Let's go.

188
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:12,625
You're late.

189
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:14,627
Sorry about that.

190
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,338
Here. It's all in there.

191
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:19,590
This is all the money we collected today.

192
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:23,469
We've been collecting IDs
from homeless people

193
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:24,470
to take out the loans.

194
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:27,181
Who are you?

195
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:29,433
No one. Keep working.

196
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:30,434
Okay.

197
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:33,646
We're working as fast as we can

198
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:35,147
to get you the amount you need.

199
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,237
When can you get it done?

200
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,322
This week? I'll try, sir.

201
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:46,075
KIM JUN-MIN

202
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,664
MASKS ARE REQUIRED
IN THE WAITING ROOM

203
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:59,713
Hello, I hope I didn't keep you waiting
too long.

204
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:02,591
DREAM ON CAPITAL

205
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:04,593
Oh, why aren't you wearing your mask?

206
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:06,345
I'll put it back on.

207
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:07,638
There's no need.

208
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:09,640
I asked you why you took it off.
Answer me.

209
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,268
I mean,
you kept us waiting for 30 minutes.

210
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,519
It was getting stuffy in here.

211
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:16,230
Whoa! How do you think
you're gonna protect people

212
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:17,523
if you don't have any patience?

213
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:20,401
Jeez, man. What does that even have to do
with me wearing a mask?

214
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:21,735
Get out.

215
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:23,779
Get out now!

216
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:27,157
Oh, fuck.

217
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,036
Little shit.

218
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:34,248
Jeez.

219
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:38,002
- You took your mask off too.
- Uh, no.

220
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:38,919
You did. I saw it.

221
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:40,796
I had it pulled down.

222
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,299
If you pulled it down,
then you took it off, you idiot.

223
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,216
Get out.

224
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:46,135
Get the fuck out!

225
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:47,928
Ah, damn it.

226
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,307
"Oh no. Damn it."

227
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,893
"Oh no! Damn it!"

228
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,352
Idiots.

229
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,065
Pull it down. Let's see it.

230
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,112
So what's your name, son?

231
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:06,780
Cheon Dong-woo, sir.

232
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,198
Hm. Height?

233
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,242
I'm 187 centimeters tall, sir.

234
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:11,869
Any training or…?

235
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:14,288
I've trained in kickboxing and hapkido
for ten years, sir.

236
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:17,499
- Your major?
- I majored in Security Services.

237
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:23,255
Oh! A man's man. Look at you!

238
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:24,298
Military?

239
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:25,299
I was exempted.

240
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:28,052
Tore my ACL playing volleyball.

241
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,262
Oh.

242
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:34,767
- Never mind. See you next time.
- Why are you turning me down, sir?

243
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:38,228
- I need a marine, kid. Get out of here.
- Does it really have to be?

244
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,147
Uh-huh. Mm-hm.

245
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:43,734
Well, shit, you should have mentioned that
in the job posting.

246
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,362
Oh, really? And why is that?

247
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,863
Because you wasted my time!

248
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,991
Who the fuck do you think
you're talking to like that?

249
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,284
Elder, my ass.

250
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,620
You don't screw around with people
like that.

251
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:00,167
I'll see you next time, uh-huh?

252
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:01,585
Yeah.

253
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:07,049
MARINE
IF IT DOESN'T WORK, MAKE IT WORK!

254
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,138
1216TH CLASS HONG WOO-JIN

255
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,274
It's you.

256
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:28,529
- Why are we running?
- He's a higher rank!

257
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:36,328
There's only one man in all of Korea
who can move a trillion in cash

258
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:37,579
- with just a phone call.
- Whoa!

259
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,540
Bang Seong-ho that is.

260
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:40,499
Oh.

261
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:45,004
And only one single person knows
what Chairman Bang even looks like.

262
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,797
Literally only one person?

263
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,424
Yeah, but keep it quiet, son.

264
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:52,511
Now, Chairman Bang trusted only one man
in his life,

265
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:54,096
and that is Mr. Choi.

266
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:58,600
Mr. Choi is the reason I can actually
make a living doing all of this here.

267
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,103
You understand this whole ecosystem now?

268
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:02,229
- Yes.
- Yeah.

269
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:04,523
Ah, all right. Yeah.

270
00:17:05,024 --> 00:17:07,151
Mr. Choi is now looking to hire someone.

271
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,528
Someone smart and fearless

272
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:11,822
who is willing to put themself
in harm's way.

273
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:13,198
Someone with a heart of pure gold

274
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:17,286
who also has some knowledge
about our unique… line of work.

275
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:21,081
I've been seeing dozens of applicants
all day, but honestly,

276
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:24,752
they just keep… falling short.

277
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:27,671
But then my junior marine gave me a call!

278
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,715
Impeccable timing, I will say, huh!

279
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:31,008
Oh man!

280
00:17:31,091 --> 00:17:33,677
And my friend's a marine. Senior marine.

281
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:35,137
What class, man?

282
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,722
The 1207th, sir.

283
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:40,184
I'm the 734th.

284
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:43,437
- Huh?
- Oh, I like this, man.

285
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,607
Mr. Choi is gonna love you two fellas.
I'll put in a good word for you.

286
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:48,942
Now I just need your IDs.

287
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:50,527
Uh, sir.

288
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:55,699
I called
because I need to help him get a loan.

289
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:59,536
That's why I'm telling you
to go meet with Mr. Choi, son.

290
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,705
He's a wild tiger on the outside,

291
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:04,792
but he has the deepest,
most understanding heart. I swear.

292
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,835
He's a true marine

293
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:09,296
who takes care of you
once he accepts you as one of his own.

294
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:11,340
He's our senior?

295
00:18:12,716 --> 00:18:14,343
Is Mr. Choi a marine? I don't know.

296
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:15,511
Is he?

297
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:20,140
I think he got an exemption
for dropping out of school too early.

298
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:24,269
Oh, so it was a figure of speech

299
00:18:24,353 --> 00:18:26,563
like how rappers say
everything is hip-hop?

300
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:27,523
Am I right?

301
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:34,196
What the hell are you talking about?
Just write down your goddamn IDs.

302
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:35,531
Yep.

303
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,248
- Judging by his face…
- Yeah?

304
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:45,499
I think this will work.

305
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:49,336
- Thanks, brother.
- Yeah. No need to thank me, all right?

306
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:52,172
How many of them did you fight?

307
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,092
- Maybe ten?
- Oh.

308
00:18:55,592 --> 00:18:58,303
- One guy got me.
- Just one?

309
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,097
He was built like a tank.

310
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:01,640
He headbutted me.

311
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,601
Hard to block a headbutt.

312
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:11,483
So, what if they… offer you work
as a debt collector

313
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:13,485
to pay off your mom's loans?

314
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:21,243
We'll figure it out.

315
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:36,466
Excellent work, as usual.

316
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,885
Okay, that's fine.

317
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:41,430
No, no, no, no.
Don't worry, we'll take care of it.

318
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,515
That happened to be Mr. Oh's specialty.

319
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:45,392
Mm-hm.

320
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:48,854
I think we should all go
to Yang-jung's place.

321
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:50,189
All right.

322
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,527
Yang Jae-myeong went around
taking out loans

323
00:19:55,611 --> 00:19:57,112
from seven different loan sharks today.

324
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,573
It turned out to be 400 million in cash.

325
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,493
Then he delivered it to a man
that works at Smile Capital.

326
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:05,871
Know him?

327
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:08,916
No, I don't.

328
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:12,961
Yang Jae-myeong is stealing homeless IDs
to create shell companies.

329
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,547
He then uses those IDs
to borrow a lot of money.

330
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,217
The loan sharks don't manage to catch on

331
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,594
because they never share information
with each other.

332
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:21,511
And then…

333
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:25,265
Then they try to collect all the money
from a fake company.

334
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:29,519
This was plotted by someone
who knows very well how cash flows.

335
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:32,814
Looks like Yang Jae-myeong
is just a pawn here really.

336
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,359
So how do you know all this?

337
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:38,362
Well, what year was it? 2000?

338
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:44,034
A volunteer at an assisted living facility
stole a bunch of the patients' IDs.

339
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:47,329
He then created
a bunch of shell companies with them,

340
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:52,125
used those to take out
seven billion won worth of loans,

341
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:53,919
then ran off to the Philippines.

342
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,088
That's be ten billion today.

343
00:20:57,714 --> 00:20:58,590
What do we do?

344
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:00,384
Huh?

345
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:03,136
Those loan sharks are getting conned.

346
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,930
They're kind of your colleagues.

347
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:06,848
I'm sure they'll be able to figure it out.

348
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:10,185
They can't exactly go to the cops,
can they?

349
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:15,148
Hyeon-ju, this is something
they will really have to solve themselves.

350
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:19,444
Listen, I'm done with that world.

351
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:21,571
And I want to keep it that way.

352
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:22,614
Sure.

353
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:26,326
So, uh, so what ended up happening
to the guy in the Philippines.

354
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:27,244
He got caught?

355
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:30,163
The loan sharks
gathered up some bloodhounds

356
00:21:30,247 --> 00:21:32,124
and sent them to chase the guy down.

357
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:33,583
Did he die?

358
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,047
Man, that's awful.

359
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,591
Hyeon-ju, what would you think

360
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,510
if I hired someone to help you
with your work?

361
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,595
No.

362
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,473
I mean, it's dangerous out there.
Look, you got hurt here.

363
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:51,310
- It was just a scratch.
- Listen to me.

364
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:53,895
Oh, no. No, no, no. I work better alone.

365
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,063
Good night.

366
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:57,816
You're a brat!

367
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:02,070
Nice shot!

368
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:03,488
So, uh…

369
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:07,242
Sir, why did mess up that kid's face?

370
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:15,500
Who told you?

371
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,627
In-beom told me about it.

372
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,838
He talks about these things?

373
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:22,758
- It's just me, sir.
- Oh, I see.

374
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:28,889
- Oh, nice.
- Good shot.

375
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:35,103
That kid spat on my face
in front of the boys.

376
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,482
I made an example out of him.

377
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,943
You shouldn't get personally involved.

378
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,158
Jang-do.

379
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:53,497
Your men will never fear you
unless you have the balls to act.

380
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:55,499
Yes sir.

381
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:59,878
Why hasn't this rich kid contacted me?

382
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:01,338
It's been a week.

383
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:04,299
I'll have Mr. Park set up a meeting
for you.

384
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,634
Don't worry. We'll win him over.

385
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:07,177
All right.

386
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:26,446
38TH NATIONAL ROOKIE APPLICATION

387
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,243
Oh man, this kid is really athletic, huh?

388
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:34,746
Didn't you use to box
back in the day too, sir?

389
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:37,165
I was just an amateur.

390
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:40,961
This body speaks to his diligence
and spirit.

391
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:43,296
Bodies, they don't lie, you know?

392
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,132
That's true, sir.

393
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:49,302
But then he doesn't know anything
about the loan business, right?

394
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:52,848
Oh, yeah.

395
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,933
This is the kid hanging with Kim Gun-woo.

396
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:58,103
According to the PI…

397
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:01,398
…he beat up a bunch of gang members,

398
00:24:01,481 --> 00:24:03,608
then joined the Marines to hide from them.

399
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:05,777
Since then, he's lived clean.

400
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:09,489
He's been on some runs,
so he should know the basics.

401
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:13,577
I think we should bring
the both of them in.

402
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:18,665
- For the time being, let's meet Gun-woo.
- Sure.

403
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,459
Right there.

404
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,047
SUSHI

405
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,929
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

406
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:36,308
You were introduced
through Mr. Moon, right?

407
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:37,350
Yeah.

408
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:40,395
This way, please.

409
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:48,320
- Go ahead.
- Hm?

410
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,779
- Yes.
- Oh.

411
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:30,612
Hello, sir. I am Kim Gun-woo, sir.

412
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:32,781
Oh. Sit down.

413
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:33,698
Thanks.

414
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:44,751
Don't worry.
You don't need to be formal with me.

415
00:25:44,834 --> 00:25:46,002
Yes, sir.

416
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:54,344
Looks like you've been cut.

417
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:56,763
Oh, yes sir, I have.

418
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:59,349
I had to fight some loan sharks
who smashed up my mother's café.

419
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,312
I used to be a loan shark myself.

420
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,900
I've been retired a while.

421
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:10,360
Yeah.

422
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:12,988
Now, I'm dedicated
to offer zero-interests loans

423
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:14,030
to sick people

424
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:17,409
who can't afford to pay
for the treatments they need.

425
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:18,827
Okay.

426
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:23,456
I think I may have a job for you.

427
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:28,295
There's a young girl
who has learning the business from me.

428
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:30,046
Ah.

429
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,923
We're actually not related.

430
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,093
But she's the only family I have.

431
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:36,720
Yeah.

432
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:40,599
I worry a lot she may get herself hurt
while going around alone.

433
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:43,685
I was hoping to hire a good person

434
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:46,313
to stay by her side
and keep her safe, you know?

435
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:48,106
Oh.

436
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,275
So it won't involve any debt collection?

437
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:52,902
No. No, no. No debt collection.

438
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:56,781
- Just security.
- Oh.

439
00:26:56,865 --> 00:26:57,699
Yeah.

440
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:03,038
I'm sorry,
you might find this a little rude,

441
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:06,166
but I did some digging into your past.

442
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:08,001
Oh, that's not a problem at all, sir.

443
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:11,421
I learned that even though
you went through so many hardships,

444
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:14,507
you've kept your heart and focus.

445
00:27:14,591 --> 00:27:18,720
You have a strong gaze
which makes me feel I can trust you.

446
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:22,974
I can, am I right?

447
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:24,017
Thank you, sir.

448
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:30,190
Uh…

449
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:34,235
Why did you start boxing?

450
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,446
When I was little,
I wanted to get stronger.

451
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:37,864
Why?

452
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,576
Well, sir, my dad had never really been
much of a heavy drinker.

453
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:44,996
Things got rough for us
in my first year of middle school.

454
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,540
He started drinking
and hitting my mother when he was drunk.

455
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:50,960
I wanted to stop him,
but I was too weak at the time.

456
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:56,341
- They still together?
- Oh, no. Th--

457
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:59,010
They got divorced
in my third year of middle school,

458
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:00,387
and I haven't seen him since.

459
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,015
- I grew up in the countryside.
- I see.

460
00:28:04,099 --> 00:28:07,394
And my father was a tenant farmer.

461
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:08,353
Okay.

462
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:10,188
I can still remember it.

463
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:13,191
Ah, I think I was maybe ten.

464
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:16,986
There was a blight on all our crops,

465
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,988
and when we couldn't pay our rent,

466
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:21,950
the landlord sent a group of his men

467
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:24,911
to brutally beat my father…

468
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:29,582
in front of everyone in the village.

469
00:28:30,166 --> 00:28:31,000
Mm-hm.

470
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:33,420
My father was badly injured,

471
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:36,381
but we couldn't afford
to go to the hospital,

472
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:40,427
so we watched him die at home.

473
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:44,347
That is why I became determined
to make money

474
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:47,600
and do my best
to help all the people that…

475
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:51,563
…can't afford medical treatment.

476
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:02,866
Ah. Sorry,
that was a pretty lousy pep talk.

477
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:06,369
What I was saying is that in the end,
we both came out of it with good hearts.

478
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:09,831
Yeah. I've always tried to lead life
with my heart, sir.

479
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:17,297
You don't talk much.

480
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:20,800
Uh, yeah. Sorry, sir.
I've never been very good with words.

481
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,052
- Oh, I see.
- Yeah.

482
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,601
- Hey, over here.
- Okay.

483
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:32,145
How did it go?

484
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,064
It went well, I think.

485
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:37,901
He basically spoke the whole time.
I just sat there and listened to him.

486
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:40,528
Hell yeah!
I told you things would go well.

487
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:44,324
Hey.

488
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:45,658
So how was he?

489
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:48,620
Well, the kid is certainly no fun.

490
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:52,582
But he's good.

491
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:55,668
Good.

492
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:01,049
Watch it.

493
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:06,679
He needs money as soon as possible.
Take care of it by the end of the day.

494
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:07,597
Yes, sir.

495
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,683
- Just give me a little.
- No, eat up.

496
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:12,435
It's a bit…

497
00:30:14,938 --> 00:30:17,190
Ah!

498
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:19,192
I hope this okay for you, dear.

499
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:23,029
- Ma'am, I love kimchi jjigae.

500
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:24,739
- May I try--
- Oh, yeah.

501
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:28,868
Careful. It's hot.

502
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:31,162
So good! Thank you so much.

503
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:32,747
Please enjoy it. My pleasure.

504
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:39,003
We really appreciate your help
with what we're going through.

505
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:42,006
Oh, it's nothing.
Besides, he's a good friend.

506
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,926
And marine, "Ack!"

507
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:47,887
Things are gonna work out.

508
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:49,806
Thank you.

509
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:51,307
Now dig in there, boys.

510
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:53,059
- Yes, ma'am!
- Thanks for cooking.

511
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:53,977
Of course.

512
00:30:56,229 --> 00:30:57,063
Huh?

513
00:30:58,314 --> 00:30:59,774
- I'll go.
- Okay.

514
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:01,359
Who is it?

515
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:05,488
Uh, hello?

516
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,074
Good evening. I work for Mr. Choi.

517
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:09,742
Oh.

518
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:14,455
Um, hello.

519
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,749
Here, a hundred million.

520
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:18,334
What?

521
00:31:18,418 --> 00:31:20,461
This is an advance
on two years' worth of your pay.

522
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,423
I mean…

523
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,932
Work starts at ten tomorrow.

524
00:31:33,016 --> 00:31:35,643
I will text you with the address.

525
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:41,357
Thank you, sir.

526
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:43,943
Thank you so, so much.

527
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:46,863
Well, you should be thanking Mr. Choi.

528
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:48,197
- Yeah.
- Good night.

529
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:50,658
Thank you.

530
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:19,979
These are so good.

531
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:21,439
Next time, I'll make you more.

532
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:25,109
Who was it?

533
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:29,364
It, um…

534
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:36,663
Uh, Mom, so I… I managed to get some work
through a friend of Woo-jin.

535
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:38,414
What kind?

536
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:43,127
I'll start working as a bodyguard
for a rich businessman's family member.

537
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:45,964
Apparently he liked me so much

538
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:48,800
that he gave me an advance
on two years of work,

539
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,301
a hundred million won.

540
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:55,932
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

541
00:32:56,015 --> 00:33:00,311
We can use this money
to pay off our debt right away, you know?

542
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:02,438
Oh…

543
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:06,484
Mm-hm.

544
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:11,531
I feel like I've destroyed your dreams.

545
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:14,492
No, Mom, that's not true.

546
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:18,454
Us having a home
matters more than anything to me, okay?

547
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,290
I can keep training hard
while I'm working,

548
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:24,210
and then I can start boxing again
when the pandemic is over.

549
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:28,464
Sorry for all of this.

550
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:30,299
Hey, Mom.

551
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:34,929
You… You should be happy, Mom.

552
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,056
Smile. This is good news.

553
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:39,809
Yeah.

554
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:46,441
Thanks, bro.

555
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:10,548
- Evening, sir.
- Out of the way. Come on.

556
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:13,801
What?

557
00:34:14,594 --> 00:34:16,012
Your guest has been waiting.

558
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:16,929
He's early.

559
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:19,182
That's Iil Group's eldest.

560
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:22,727
- Yeah, so?
- Love, just be careful.

561
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,187
- Why?
- Over here!

562
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,438
Yes, sir.

563
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:28,066
Can you get me some wet wipes?

564
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:30,985
I pressed the button a bunch of times,
but no one came.

565
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,570
I'm sorry. I'll get some now.

566
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:34,697
Back when I used to work at Speed,

567
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:36,657
that guy got drunk
and picked a fight with the owner.

568
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,993
- Hyeon-ji?
- Yeah, her.

569
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,662
They had an argument
talking about politics

570
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:45,166
then days later,
the store was suddenly audited.

571
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:48,002
She sold her house to pay the taxes.

572
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:52,090
We found out later
his family is super connected.

573
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:54,675
National Tax Service, the police force…

574
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:56,761
They really know everyone.

575
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:58,387
Well, chaebols are like that.

576
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:00,098
Oh, yeah?

577
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:03,059
I guess
they probably insulted a family member.

578
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:04,393
Ah.

579
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:07,730
It's just I'm worried about you, honey.

580
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:10,149
Thank you.

581
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,527
You arranged for pretty some girls, right?

582
00:35:13,569 --> 00:35:14,946
No, he told me not to.

583
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:20,118
I see. Don't worry, okay?

584
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:23,287
He brought someone.

585
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:25,081
- Who?
- He's an officer.

586
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:29,919
Really?

587
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:32,171
Yeah, graduated top of his class.

588
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:36,342
Know him?

589
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:39,887
I only know him by reputation, sir.

590
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:48,479
Make sure to keep it cool in there.

591
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,107
- Understood?
- Yeah.

592
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:56,863
- I'll put in a call.
- Yeah.

593
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:00,658
No need for that.

594
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:01,993
- Gentlemen.
- Hm.

595
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:03,661
About time.

596
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:07,540
This here is my dear cousin.

597
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:09,584
I'm Min Gang-yong. Nice to meet you.

598
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,294
You have a great voice.

599
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:12,587
Kim Myeong-gil.

600
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,755
I hope you don't mind that I tagged along

601
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,424
for a couple of drinks.

602
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:19,927
I hear that you're a very important man.
It's an honor to meet you, sir.

603
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,095
It's all mine.

604
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:24,724
This is Lee Jin-su.
He's an associate of mine.

605
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:26,100
Oh.

606
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,603
Hold on, have we met before by any chance?

607
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:30,521
No, I just have one of those faces.

608
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:32,023
I'm sorry.

609
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:34,901
- Have a seat.
- Sure.

610
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:40,531
I didn't feel comfortable
drinking on your dime.

611
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:43,326
It was my intention to offer.

612
00:36:46,495 --> 00:36:47,371
Please, let me.

613
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:55,046
I'm sorry.
Unfortunately, he doesn't drink.

614
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:58,174
Ah, you can't be
the only sober person here.

615
00:36:58,257 --> 00:37:02,595
Getting drunk together means
no one can change their minds later on.

616
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:05,389
Then be a good friend and drink his share.

617
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:07,225
You seem like a pretty strong drinker.

618
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:08,684
Loyalty.

619
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:11,562
Please go ahead and pour it.

620
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:27,078
Like a real expert.

621
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:28,829
Smooth, right?

622
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:30,414
Yeah.

623
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,416
Let me pour you one now.

624
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:35,002
Would you like a shot as well?

625
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:38,089
I had a bigger glass in mind.

626
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:40,007
- Top me off, sir.
- Here.

627
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:47,265
I'm just a lowly government employee
used to drinking soju bombs,

628
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:51,227
but tonight, I drink blue.

629
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:58,484
Now let me.

630
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:28,472
Hell of a drinker.

631
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:30,224
I'll have a glass.

632
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:31,851
It's my liquor.

633
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:33,686
Hm?

634
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:35,896
Let me pour it for you.

635
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:42,111
Please.

636
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:57,752
And you.

637
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:05,801
Oh, yeah.

638
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:07,845
Cheers!

639
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,264
Cheers.

640
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:26,614
You both drink very well.

641
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:30,284
Cousin, if I get drunk and offensive,
stop me.

642
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:31,994
If that happens…

643
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:34,330
Where is it? I'll…

644
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,210
arrest you.

645
00:39:45,841 --> 00:39:47,176
Let's drink more. Come on.

646
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:05,736
Oh, fuck me.

647
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:09,573
Now that we've shared
some drinks together,

648
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:12,118
let's be frank here.

649
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,036
Let's do it.

650
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:16,747
Are you rich?

651
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:19,417
I've worked hard my whole life
to make my money.

652
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:22,211
How much?

653
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:24,296
It's enough.

654
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:26,590
And all of it is legitimate.

655
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:28,259
Is that so?

656
00:40:29,802 --> 00:40:31,220
That's odd.

657
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:34,807
I heard
if you looked at Smile Capital's assets,

658
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:36,934
you'd barely find 50 billion.

659
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:38,561
You're right.

660
00:40:38,644 --> 00:40:41,355
I wonder
if the National Tax Agency knows that.

661
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:42,815
Should we call them?

662
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:45,151
Oh no, you're drunk.

663
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:47,945
Look how much you've upset Mr. Kim.
Apologize to him.

664
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:49,655
Oh, I'm sorry.

665
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:52,241
I've been drinking on an empty stomach.

666
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:54,785
It's hitting me hard.

667
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:57,538
Don't you worry.
We have all the money you need.

668
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:00,207
Oh, yeah?

669
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,084
Okay.

670
00:41:02,877 --> 00:41:05,629
I guess I should never worry about money.

671
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:12,136
Oh, yeah. My mom sends her regards
to Chairman Bang.

672
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:15,473
She is very thankful.

673
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:18,601
But the man
who got her the money that day…

674
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:24,356
was apparently in his mid-40s.

675
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:29,570
How do you manage to look so good
after 20 years?

676
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:31,989
Is it plastic surgery?

677
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:35,117
A face lift!

678
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:38,579
I see.

679
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:41,749
You thought
I wouldn't ask my own mother, huh?

680
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:43,250
Come on, out with it!

681
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44,877
Why so quiet?

682
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:49,548
Huh? You're just not gonna talk now?

683
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:54,678
Did they teach you not talk in prison?

684
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:59,642
This guy's laughing.

685
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:01,936
Sure, smile all you want.

686
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:05,648
God damn! Well,

687
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:08,651
I'm done drinking. Let's wrap it up.

688
00:42:10,569 --> 00:42:11,612
Mr. Kim.

689
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:13,989
I won't make the call.

690
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:17,034
As long as we never cross paths again.

691
00:42:19,078 --> 00:42:20,162
Kimmie.

692
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:23,332
Come on now.

693
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:35,678
If you ever

694
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:38,347
mess with my family again,

695
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:41,392
you'll die.

696
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:48,440
You understand?

697
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:50,776
Hm?

698
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:56,198
Oh man,
look at this scary knife wound here. Whoa!

699
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:58,993
- He's the real deal.
- Let's go.

700
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:01,453
You're right. We've been here too long.

701
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:04,373
I tried to give you
the benefit of the doubt.

702
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:06,792
I thought you were a hard-working man.

703
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:20,139
Jang-do.

704
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:21,473
Yeah?

705
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:25,728
You'll follow Beom.
Find something we can use.

706
00:43:26,478 --> 00:43:27,646
Something big.

707
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:30,524
I'm on it, sir.

708
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:33,944
ANTIQUES SHOPPING CENTER

709
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:43,621
- Hey, thanks for coming with me.
- Oh, no problem.

710
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:48,042
Wait.

711
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:49,460
What?

712
00:43:49,543 --> 00:43:51,795
- Uh, are you coming in?
- Yeah.

713
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:54,965
I'm gonna make my case to Mr. Choi
and get a job as well.

714
00:43:55,049 --> 00:43:55,966
We could work together.

715
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:57,760
That would be awesome.

716
00:43:57,843 --> 00:43:59,970
Right?! So talk me up, add some flavor.

717
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:01,472
MSG.

718
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:03,307
- Mm-hm.
- Cool. Let's go.

719
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:27,373
- Morning!
- Hello!

720
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:31,126
I see you found your way here.

721
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:32,461
Yes.

722
00:44:32,544 --> 00:44:33,379
And this morning,

723
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:35,923
I used the advance you gave me
to pay off my family's loans.

724
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:38,050
Thank you so much.
Really, thank you so much.

725
00:44:41,095 --> 00:44:42,805
I have faith that you'll do very well.

726
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:44,765
I'll give it everything I have.

727
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:47,768
Good morning, sir! I'm Hong Woo-jin.

728
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:50,896
I've helped Mr. Moon with his work
in the past.

729
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:54,775
I'm a close friend of Gun-woo's
from our time in the Marines.

730
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:56,026
Yeah.

731
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:58,320
Watching his struggles
from the sidelines,

732
00:44:59,071 --> 00:45:01,657
I was truly ashamed
that I couldn't help him more

733
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,325
because of my very limited means.

734
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:04,243
It killed me inside.

735
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:07,705
I'm relieved he met someone like you
who could help him out.

736
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:10,124
I'm really grateful that happened.

737
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:13,585
I also believe that I, Hong Woo-jin,
may also be of service to you.

738
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:16,296
I've done this kind of work before.

739
00:45:17,923 --> 00:45:20,718
Not to toot my own horn too much
in front of you,

740
00:45:20,801 --> 00:45:22,511
but I was thinking maybe it would…

741
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:25,472
You know, since I know the ropes,

742
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:29,601
maybe it would be good
since he's just now starting out

743
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:31,145
for me to help.

744
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:34,356
Seems like
this would help him adjust quickly.

745
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,650
- And ultimately be in your favor.
- Yeah.

746
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:39,278
And with these thoughts in mind,
that led me to you.

747
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:41,113
With your permission,

748
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:43,323
I'd like to help Gun-woo
with his work, sir!

749
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:51,790
Sure, why not?

750
00:45:55,544 --> 00:45:56,462
Thank you.

751
00:45:57,838 --> 00:45:58,797
Sit down.

752
00:45:58,881 --> 00:45:59,798
- Sir.
- Sir.

753
00:46:02,342 --> 00:46:04,511
- Thank you, sir!
- Thanks so much.

754
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:07,431
There is one thing I didn't mention
when we first met.

755
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:08,474
Oh.

756
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:11,727
I may be the one paying you,
but I'm not gonna be the one hiring you.

757
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:13,270
Sorry?

758
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:15,564
You still have to interview with Hyeon-ju.

759
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:23,030
Ah, uh, so what would happen
if I were to fail the interview, sir?

760
00:46:23,113 --> 00:46:25,073
You'd have to return
all the money I gave you.

761
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:30,245
Oh, but already I used all of it
to pay back our loan.

762
00:46:30,329 --> 00:46:32,080
I believe you'll do very well with her.

763
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:33,582
Huh?

764
00:46:34,666 --> 00:46:39,463
Although she's not very keen on the idea
of having a bodyguard around.

765
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:42,216
But you know I'm terrible with words,
Mr. Choi.

766
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:44,259
Good luck.

767
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:46,428
Um, sir.

768
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:49,807
If I can convince her
to hire both me and Gun-woo,

769
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:52,476
sir, would that mean
I also get to receive a salary?

770
00:46:55,354 --> 00:46:56,647
Okay.

771
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:57,648
Nice.

772
00:46:59,274 --> 00:47:01,485
All right,
I have a scalp massage I have to get to.

773
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:02,861
- Oh, yes.
- Yeah.

774
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:04,571
Sir, please enjoy your time.

775
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:05,656
Also…

776
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:11,328
Use this… to get yourself some food.

777
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:12,246
Uh…

778
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:15,332
Uh, thank you, sir.

779
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:19,253
You really know how to take care
of your employees.

780
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:23,841
You two…

781
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,387
should stick together no matter what.

782
00:47:29,763 --> 00:47:30,597
Oh.

783
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:31,598
- Yes!
- Yes!

784
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:33,016
Godspeed!

785
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,142
- Godspeed!
- Godspeed!

786
00:47:45,779 --> 00:47:46,738
Wait a minute.

787
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:55,831
Shit, bro.

788
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:58,125
- What?
- Look!

789
00:47:58,208 --> 00:47:59,334
What happened?

790
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:02,296
- It was in here.
- Really?

791
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:05,132
That's… That's gotta be millions.

792
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,466
No. Wait.

793
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:13,098
Whoa.

794
00:48:14,933 --> 00:48:16,518
Oh God, there's even more.

795
00:48:18,186 --> 00:48:19,104
No way.

796
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:41,668
THERE WILL BE GUESTS AT THE BOOKSTORE
HAVE A NICE CHAT

797
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:43,545
Oh shit.

798
00:48:44,546 --> 00:48:48,383
17 billion, 18 billion,

799
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:51,136
19…

800
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:53,305
21…

801
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:55,557
- Uh…
- 22.

802
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,477
I think I've met Hyeon-ju before.

803
00:48:59,269 --> 00:49:01,480
Huh? You've met?

804
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:04,316
When I went over to see you
a few days ago,

805
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:07,694
she was, uh, chasing a homeless person,

806
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:11,031
so I stepped in,
and then Hyeon-ju tased me.

807
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:13,283
- You got tased?
- Mm-hm.

808
00:49:13,867 --> 00:49:15,577
And then what? Did you two fight?

809
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:19,164
Nuh-uh. She just cussed me out and left.

810
00:49:19,247 --> 00:49:20,749
Oh…

811
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:24,086
You got me.

812
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:26,296
I'll be sure to take care of it.

813
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:27,798
You just keep, yeah.

814
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:30,801
- Mm.
- Just keep… keep your head down.

815
00:49:32,135 --> 00:49:33,595
You made me lose count.

816
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:34,554
My bad.

817
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:43,105
Oh!

818
00:49:44,898 --> 00:49:46,149
Hello, Ms. Hyeon-ju.

819
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:47,234
How are you?

820
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:51,363
We were both hand-picked by Mr. Choi,
so you can safely go about your work.

821
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:56,743
#GoOn. #SecurityGuard.

822
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:58,078
#Manager.

823
00:49:58,161 --> 00:50:02,374
#Brother. Brother.

824
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:04,501
What was that?

825
00:50:04,584 --> 00:50:05,419
Brother.

826
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:07,713
Welcome your two new best friends.

827
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:14,261
Um, uh, say the word,
and we'll…

828
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:17,014
- Anything you need.
- I don't need anything.

829
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:22,185
Uh yeah, um, but we'll…

830
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:24,062
…whenever you decide
to call on us to do it.

831
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:27,107
Oh, no, I won't need anything ever,
so leave.

832
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:32,070
- Mm.
- Mm.

833
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:34,573
You don't like us?

834
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:37,034
How would I know when we've just me?

835
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:38,577
I don't need you.

836
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:41,830
You haven't seen us work yet,
so how would you know?

837
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:45,667
I haven't had a problem doing everything
completely on my own so far.

838
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:47,127
That's how I know.

839
00:50:47,794 --> 00:50:49,421
I hate people that argue.

840
00:50:49,504 --> 00:50:50,756
I'm not arguing.

841
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:51,840
You just did it again.

842
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:54,593
Get out.

843
00:51:01,183 --> 00:51:04,186
Mr. Choi told us
this was the arrangement, okay?

844
00:51:05,145 --> 00:51:06,772
Not that you had to persuade me?

845
00:51:09,107 --> 00:51:11,359
So now you're lying to me?

846
00:51:12,778 --> 00:51:14,488
I only thought your shoes were fake.

847
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:16,323
Leave.

848
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:19,284
It's time to go!

849
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:21,953
Hello?

850
00:51:22,037 --> 00:51:22,996
What are you? Deaf?

851
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:25,791
Hit the road. Go!

852
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:47,729
I really, really need this job.

853
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:49,523
Please just let me work here for a month.

854
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:51,441
If I'm no help, I'll leave.

855
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:53,777
I promise. Just give me a month.
Please, I'm begging you.

856
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:55,237
Listen,

857
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:58,073
if you need to borrow money,
my grandpa will lend you some.

858
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:00,784
I'll be sure to put in a good word
for you.

859
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:02,828
This is awkward.

860
00:52:02,911 --> 00:52:03,745
But he already…

861
00:52:05,747 --> 00:52:10,710
He already gave me a two-year advancement
on the pay because…

862
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:13,296
…there's a Smile Capital loan
that my mom took out.

863
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:16,383
And they completely duped her.

864
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:20,470
I had to pay it
with all the money he gave me.

865
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:25,016
If… If I have to pay that money,
then we lose our house.

866
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:28,436
So please, just help me this one time.

867
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:32,524
Get up now.

868
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:34,276
You hungry?

869
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:46,663
Smile Capital loaned you money?

870
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:49,332
They conned my mom.

871
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:52,294
How big was the loan then?

872
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:54,671
A hundred mill.

873
00:52:55,463 --> 00:52:59,092
And you paid it off with no penalties?

874
00:52:59,926 --> 00:53:01,887
They destroyed my mom's café.

875
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:04,764
It's a total mess now.

876
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:10,645
They did that to your face?

877
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:12,981
Yeah.

878
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,735
I'm sure you're pissed.

879
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:19,779
Did you go to the police?

880
00:53:20,822 --> 00:53:21,656
No way.

881
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:26,494
They threatened to kill my mother
if I called the police.

882
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:28,622
Who did?

883
00:53:30,248 --> 00:53:31,458
It was their boss.

884
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:35,086
Delicious hamburgers have arrived. Here.

885
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:38,757
Listen, then eat.

886
00:53:45,347 --> 00:53:46,598
Maybe you've heard

887
00:53:46,681 --> 00:53:48,850
my grandpa gives out zero-interest loans

888
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:51,353
to people who are down on their luck
and really need them.

889
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:55,440
But some people try to take advantage
of his generosity.

890
00:53:56,816 --> 00:53:58,568
Yang Jae-myeong is one.

891
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:02,113
He borrowed ten million for his mom,

892
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:03,698
then he just disappeared.

893
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:05,951
Took me half a year to find him.

894
00:54:07,285 --> 00:54:09,621
Begging at a train station.

895
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:14,167
I thought Yang Jae-myeong
had really become homeless,

896
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:18,546
then I saw his pearly whites.

897
00:54:19,506 --> 00:54:21,007
So I decided to tail him.

898
00:54:21,633 --> 00:54:25,679
I found out that he and his goons
were pretending to be homeless

899
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:28,431
and stealing IDs
from the actual homeless at night.

900
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:31,518
They use them to start shell corporations.

901
00:54:32,852 --> 00:54:37,774
Then con the loan sharks
taking thousands, sometimes millions.

902
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:41,486
It all looks very professional,

903
00:54:41,569 --> 00:54:43,822
so someone has to be pulling the strings
behind the scenes.

904
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:49,327
This guy was seen speaking
with Yang Jae-myeong.

905
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:51,454
Know him?

906
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:57,252
I do.

907
00:55:02,632 --> 00:55:04,718
Our goal tonight is to get an exact count

908
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:08,054
on how many IDs
these thugs are stealing each day.

909
00:55:08,138 --> 00:55:10,348
Stay calm no matter what.

910
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:11,808
If they know we're onto them,

911
00:55:11,891 --> 00:55:13,560
then all my work has been for nothing.

912
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:19,691
IDENTIFICATION CARD

913
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:32,889
Cover your faces and hang back.

914
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:00,750
Hey. How about this guy?

915
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:02,627
He's piss-drunk.

916
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:04,337
He might have something on him.

917
00:57:06,464 --> 00:57:07,424
Go, go.

918
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:12,303
Look, there, there.

919
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:14,013
Find someone who isn't wasted.

920
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:15,098
Okay.

921
00:57:17,058 --> 00:57:18,393
- Come on.
- Okay.

922
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:20,145
- Hey, let's go.
- Okay.

923
00:57:41,166 --> 00:57:42,417
Head down.

924
00:57:51,092 --> 00:57:52,093
Hello, sir.

925
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:54,804
Uh, what? Huh?

926
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:58,433
You shouldn't be sleeping
on this cold floor with flimsy newspaper.

927
00:57:58,516 --> 00:58:00,852
You should put something else down first.

928
00:58:00,935 --> 00:58:02,020
Yeah.

929
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:05,064
Have you eaten yet?

930
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:07,400
Uh, two days ago.

931
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,694
Ah. We're here to help you.

932
00:58:09,777 --> 00:58:12,447
We're here with a homeless charity
funded by the city.

933
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:14,449
Oh, I see.

934
00:58:14,532 --> 00:58:18,453
The government created this organization
so we could help each other out, okay?

935
00:58:18,536 --> 00:58:19,496
You can join us.

936
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:23,708
If you join,
you won't have to sit out here like this.

937
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:25,585
We'll find you a job.

938
00:58:26,377 --> 00:58:29,172
Every single month,
we'll give you 20 free masks.

939
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:33,468
And you'll get a monthly stipend,
300,000 won.

940
00:58:33,968 --> 00:58:35,762
- Three hundred?
- Yeah.

941
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:38,014
- Sir.
- Yeah?

942
00:58:38,097 --> 00:58:41,559
Listen, if you have an ID with you,
we can just do the registration right now.

943
00:58:41,643 --> 00:58:43,728
You'll have the money in a month.
Sound good?

944
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:45,730
What do you say, huh?

945
00:58:45,813 --> 00:58:47,065
- Yeah.
- Great.

946
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:50,151
Here.

947
00:58:51,986 --> 00:58:54,697
Not everyone can participate.
Keep it quiet, okay?

948
00:58:55,573 --> 00:58:56,407
Thanks.

949
00:58:56,491 --> 00:58:58,368
Damn, that guy's got a silver tongue.

950
00:58:58,451 --> 00:58:59,369
Thank you.

951
00:59:02,455 --> 00:59:03,873
Four IDs so far…

952
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:17,845
- Excuse me, sir.
- What?

953
00:59:18,846 --> 00:59:21,057
We're here with the Homeless Association
to help people.

954
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:22,517
- What the--
- Yeah.

955
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,102
It's you again!

956
00:59:24,602 --> 00:59:27,397
You son of a bitch.
Where's my ID? Give it back!

957
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:31,192
You crazy…
You crazy old bastard. Fucker!

958
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:33,736
Let me go, you old fuck!

959
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:37,323
Old ass piece of shit!

960
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:39,701
No, we can't help.
