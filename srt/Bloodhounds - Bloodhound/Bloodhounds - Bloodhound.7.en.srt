1
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:10,802
Are we sure
the patient is doing okay?

2
00:00:10,885 --> 00:00:13,930
His BP is dropping again.
Hang on. Let me check.

3
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:02,228
You should eat these.

4
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:06,149
You need to eat well today.

5
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,902
- Thank you. I will.
- You're welcome.

6
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:35,637
Uh, excuse me, but the girl that was here.
Did you see where she went?

7
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,430
Uh, she left a while ago.

8
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:38,932
Do you know when?

9
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:40,850
About ten minutes ago.

10
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,436
Thank you.

11
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:49,419
Excuse me.

12
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:53,256
You are Hong Woo-jin's guardian, right?

13
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:55,258
Uh, yes.

14
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:57,719
The operation went well.

15
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:02,223
We'll have to monitor his progress,
but the surgery was successful.

16
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:12,108
God, thank you.

17
00:03:14,944 --> 00:03:16,029
Thank you so much.

18
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:21,284
Hang in there.

19
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:22,869
Yeah.

20
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:02,283
BLOODHOUNDS

21
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,718
MARINE SPIRIT!
KIM MYEONG-GIL

22
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,761
Hey.

23
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:05,555
Gets me every time.

24
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:07,932
Let's go.

25
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,611
Whoa!

26
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:26,117
Let's run.

27
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:55,813
Woo!

28
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:57,857
Ah!

29
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,014
- Eighty-six!
- Eighty-six!

30
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:31,891
Eighty-eight!

31
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:33,601
- Eighty-nine!
- Eighty-nine!

32
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,561
- Ninety!
- Ten more!

33
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:37,730
One!

34
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:38,689
- Two!
- Two!

35
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,358
- Three!
- Three!

36
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:43,945
Twelve.

37
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,030
Thirteen.

38
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:48,825
Fourteen.

39
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,118
Good morning, sir.

40
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,538
Good morning, sir.

41
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:07,301
Continue.

42
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:12,432
Fifteen.

43
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:14,934
Sixteen.

44
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:17,103
One, two, three, four!

45
00:07:17,603 --> 00:07:19,689
One, two, three, four, five!

46
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,691
One, two, three, four!

47
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:23,943
One, two, three, four!

48
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,862
One, two, three, four!

49
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:27,947
One, two, three, four!

50
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,491
One, two, three, four!

51
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:50,553
You did it! Yes!

52
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:00,104
- Whoa!
- Good job. Get up.

53
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:05,193
What we want to do is topple them
and knock them off balance, right?

54
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:07,028
- So I think--
- Hey, guys.

55
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,238
I think we should have a talk.

56
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:14,035
I already told you both no.

57
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:17,288
If you go back there, you're gonna die.

58
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:21,584
We understand
why you would be worried about us, Mr. Oh.

59
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,294
Then why don't you listen to me?

60
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:25,004
To be rebellious?

61
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:28,090
Uh, Mr. Oh, if I may,

62
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,800
let me tell you what I think about this.

63
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,429
After all the experience we've gathered,

64
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,097
I believe we can fight
Kim Myeong-gil and win.

65
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:42,897
Yang-jung and Du-yeong are dead.

66
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:44,774
How can you win?

67
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,944
By following all the instructions
that Mr. Choi gave us.

68
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:49,612
Uh.

69
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:52,949
Too many people have had their family
and things they love taken away

70
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:53,866
by Kim Myeong-gil.

71
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:57,245
Mr. Choi said
that if we gather those people

72
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:59,539
and combined our resources
that we'd be sure to win.

73
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:01,332
Everyone's in hiding

74
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:03,584
because they know
that they don't stand a chance alone,

75
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:06,045
but if others like me and Woo-jin
decide to show up,

76
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:07,713
I'm sure they're gonna want to help us.

77
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:11,926
What if… Kim Myeong-gil gets to you first?

78
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,844
Oh, you don't have to worry
about the two of us.

79
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:14,929
Woo-jin has fully healed,

80
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:18,182
and I've gone up two weight classes,
so my punches are stronger.

81
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:20,893
We're fully prepared to take him
and his minions down this time.

82
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:24,564
Between what we've learned
from Mr. Choi, Mr. Lee, and Mr. Hwang,

83
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,232
I'm sure we can beat Kim Myeong-gil.

84
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:28,484
No.

85
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:30,444
I won't allow you to.

86
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:32,738
And that's the end of it.

87
00:09:33,823 --> 00:09:35,533
Mm.

88
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:16,532
Mr. Oh, I'll be in Rome
by the time you read this letter.

89
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:20,911
I rented out a small room
with the money Grandpa left me.

90
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,791
I had promised him
that we'd all go to Rome together

91
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,044
- after taking down Kim Myeong-gil.
-

92
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,420
But I ruined everything.

93
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,841
I won't ask you to understand my actions.

94
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:38,012
But if I stay here,
I'll keep thinking about Grandpa.

95
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:39,055
and I can't handle that.

96
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:42,558
Wherever I go, I'm reminded of him,

97
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,144
and I can't stop crying.

98
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,438
It's driving me crazy.

99
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:51,233
Things will get better
if I'm somewhere far away.

100
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:53,527
I love you,

101
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:54,904
and I'm sorry.

102
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:12,338
- Jesus, it hurts so much.
- What you're feeling isn't pain.

103
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,965
It's the feeling
of weakness leaving your body.

104
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,425
What does that mean?

105
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:19,595
It means you're gonna emerge
stronger than yesterday.

106
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:26,185
Guys.

107
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:27,228
Follow me.

108
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:31,691
Yes, sir.

109
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:53,129
This is the last
of Mr. Choi's emergency money.

110
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:54,964
Take it and go.

111
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:59,552
I tried to hold you back
because of my fears, and I'm sorry.

112
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:02,555
I'll book a room and car for you in Seoul.

113
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:04,432
Don't get hurt.

114
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:07,226
Thank you

115
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:09,103
We appreciate it.

116
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,733
We'll win, no matter what.

117
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:57,151
809.

118
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:01,655
Oh, here.

119
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:12,374
Yes?

120
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:17,838
Yeah, uh, hello.

121
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:20,633
The two of us were sent here
by Mr. Oh In-muk.

122
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:30,601
Come in.

123
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:31,560
Let's go.

124
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,780
Now, if I come back

125
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:45,449
and find the tape's been torn
or moved at all,

126
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,201
I'll report you to the police.

127
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:48,786
Uh, why?

128
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:50,871
My underwear is in there.

129
00:13:51,622 --> 00:13:53,624
- Oh, no, that's not gonna to happen.
- Nuh-uh. Nuh-uh.

130
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,003
There's one bed here and another above.

131
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,713
Who wants the one on top?

132
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,215
- Doesn't matter.
- Yeah.

133
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:03,342
Then you take the top bunk.

134
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:04,343
Okay.

135
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:08,931
Uh, excuse me, sorry, but may I ask
how you came to that decision? Hm?

136
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:11,392
Just because I can.

137
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:13,477
Oh.

138
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,898
Uh, here's the key card

139
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:19,984
and the keys for the car
Grandpa told me to rent.

140
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:25,155
And here's my number,
but don't call me, please.

141
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:26,073
I'm busy.

142
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:28,701
- Okay?
- Yeah.

143
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:30,327
Cool.

144
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,461
Thank you.

145
00:14:39,545 --> 00:14:40,379
See you.

146
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:46,343
Hey, wait a sec.

147
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:49,179
Didn't she just say
that Mr. Oh is her grandpa?

148
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,390
Mm-hm. She did say that.

149
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,729
Ah, they do look alike
now that I think about.

150
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:59,148
They're both small
and wear glasses.

151
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,235
It seemed like she was forced
to let us stay here.

152
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:04,445
Yeah, it did.

153
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:06,989
I feel bad.

154
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,532
Enough of that.

155
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:11,535
- Let's wash up and strategize.
- Okay.

156
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,372
- My stomach really hurts. Out of the way.
- Whoa, ouch.

157
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:38,729
YANG JAE-MYEONG

158
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:39,647
Why him?

159
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,983
Because I think we need to capture
Yang Jae-myeong first to gather intel.

160
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:43,984
You?

161
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,072
YANG JAE-MYEONG
MR. MOON, PRESIDENT IM

162
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:50,741
I think we need
to gather our allies first.

163
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:52,534
We'll be more powerful
if we work together.

164
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:53,869
That's a good idea.

165
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,247
But how are we going to find this person?

166
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:58,499
IIL GROUP HEIR

167
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:00,209
Mr. Choi said he'd be our greatest asset.

168
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,878
I was thinking about it
on the way here.

169
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,130
It won't be easy to get him to meet us.

170
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,091
But I'm gonna try to come up with a plan.

171
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:08,008
Mm.

172
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,307
- Hey, look!
- Hm?

173
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,227
Whoa!

174
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,898
I think this is a convertible.

175
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:24,733
- The roof retracts?
- Yes.

176
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,527
It's fabric.

177
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:37,621
Sir.

178
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,167
There are so many people

179
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:45,170
who have been screwed over
by Smile Capital just like you.

180
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,673
We're suggesting that we all join forces.

181
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:52,052
Honestly, the loan sharks in this area
basically all know one another.

182
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:55,222
If you were to take the lead,
all the others would follow you.

183
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,268
And then what?

184
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,186
You take back your money

185
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:05,399
and make sure Smile never pulls this shit
with private moneylenders again.

186
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,110
We can obliterate them. Hm?

187
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,612
You've lost a couple hundred million
to them, right?

188
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,037
No, can't do it.

189
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,163
Ah.

190
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:21,707
If your little plan doesn't work,
I can end up dead.

191
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,375
What about all your money?

192
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,169
Fuck that. It's not worth it, man.

193
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:27,296
I mean, I can make more.

194
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,840
I'm not getting involved.

195
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:32,468
You see, I value my life more than money.

196
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,595
- Sir, please--
- Hey.

197
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:51,779
Hey, what the fuck?

198
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:54,782
What happened?

199
00:17:57,284 --> 00:17:59,119
Sir? Sir?

200
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:03,040
Yo, you aren't allowed in here.

201
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:07,211
Oh, my junior marines!
What are you guys doing here, huh?

202
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:08,921
Sir, what happened to you?

203
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:10,589
Huh?

204
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,008
Oh, I uh…

205
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:14,927
A few days ago,

206
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:18,430
a bunch of gangsters came in
and took everything I've got.

207
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,557
Why?

208
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:32,194
I have ten billion won in bonds
that expire within a month.

209
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:36,532
If you get all of this money back for me,
I'll give you a cut.

210
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:38,575
Five percent.

211
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:42,913
This is way too good to pass up.

212
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:44,998
Then we should sign it now.

213
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:49,545
An elegant lady like yourself

214
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:52,172
probably doesn't know
how these things work.

215
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,550
Uh, these matters

216
00:18:55,217 --> 00:19:00,347
require mutual trust, you know,
to come to an agreement.

217
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:07,980
I'll find someone else then.

218
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:12,526
- Hm.
- Uh, wait. Wait, wait. Hold on, hold on.

219
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:15,237
Sometimes we can…

220
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,822
…make exceptions.

221
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,532
Now…

222
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:23,162
MOON GWANG-MU

223
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:24,788
I found out later

224
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:28,292
that in the middle of that contract,
written in the fine print,

225
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,712
it said that if I didn't get these bonds
within the month,

226
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:34,298
I had to pay for half the entire amount.

227
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:35,841
Yeah, that was in there.

228
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:41,889
Definitely sounds like
Smile Capital's way of working.

229
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:43,807
What the fuck it that?

230
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:46,185
Its CEO is Kim Myeong-gil.

231
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:49,730
Kim Myeong-gil who worked for Mr. Choi?

232
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:51,190
Yes.

233
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:53,483
Where is that son of a bitch now, huh?

234
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:57,654
Did you hear about
what happened to Mr. Choi, sir?

235
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,239
What?

236
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:00,824
I'm sorry, but…

237
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:05,871
Mr. Choi was killed by Kim Myeong-gil.

238
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:12,461
Uh, what are you guys talking about?

239
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:16,256
Kim Myeong-gil killed Mr. Choi, Mr. Hwang,
and Mr. Lee. He killed them all.

240
00:20:19,134 --> 00:20:22,012
We've been lying low in the countryside
with Mr. Oh until till now.

241
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:25,057
Fuck, stop it guys.
This isn't funny, okay?

242
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:32,272
I said… I said stop it.

243
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:34,358
I said stop it. This isn't funny at all!

244
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,294
What?

245
00:20:58,423 --> 00:20:59,967
How could Mr. Choi be dead?

246
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:02,052
Why?

247
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:04,805
What do you mean?

248
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:07,015
Are you saying he's dead?

249
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:10,811
Come on, fucking answer me, you assholes.

250
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:11,853
Damn it!

251
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:12,854
God!

252
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,526
How could Mr. Choi be dead?

253
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,027
Tell me how, huh?

254
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:36,712
Man, I'm tired.

255
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:37,921
Oh, I'm exhausted.

256
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:41,049
Let's get some rest.

257
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,217
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

258
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,015
Who's there?

259
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,519
It's been a while.

260
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,982
- These motherfuckers.
- Ah, shit.

261
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:03,071
Uh…

262
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:13,290
Hey, I'll tell you everything.
Just don't hit me, huh?

263
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,876
Word got around amongst the homeless,

264
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:18,795
so we've been going around
facilities for the disabled to steal IDs.

265
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,714
We weren't asking about you.

266
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:22,466
What's going on at Smile Capital?

267
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:26,011
Oh, well, then you should've been
a little more specific.

268
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:27,888
Has the casino opened, sir?

269
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:30,724
Wait a sec.

270
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:32,267
Hey, look down.

271
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:41,109
Can you maybe try a tough guy act?

272
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,195
How do I do that?

273
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:45,113
First off, don't be so polite.

274
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:50,827
Dude, that guy is clearly over 40.
I don't want to talk down to him.

275
00:22:52,412 --> 00:22:53,413
All right, okay.

276
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:56,124
If he speaks down to you,
punch him in the face.

277
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,168
Mm-hm.

278
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:05,967
Hey, hard to believe, but I'm actually 31.

279
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:08,970
And I won't speak down to you guys,
so there's no need for any violence.

280
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,764
My body is a wreck right now.

281
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:12,265
Not too long ago,

282
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:14,351
a piece of shit
slashed both of my Achilles heels,

283
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:16,186
and I spent four months
in physical therapy.

284
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:18,814
That piece of shit is our friend.
Watch your mouth.

285
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:23,777
What happened was on me.
I totally deserved all of it.

286
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,321
So, back to the casino?

287
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:27,864
Yes.

288
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:30,075
I happened to overhear
the director talking on the phone.

289
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:32,202
Director? What's his name?

290
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:33,161
Kim Jun-min, sir.

291
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,415
He's alive?

292
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:39,126
Some piece of shit slashed his neck
with a knife, and he--

293
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:45,507
Ah, you're on the same team.

294
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:48,301
Okay, I understand everything now, 100%.

295
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:51,471
I'm gonna watch my mouth now,
so there's no need to hit me.

296
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:53,765
I fucking hate Kim Jun-min.

297
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:55,392
That guy's a fucking asshole.

298
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:57,519
Smile Capital's also a bunch
of motherfuckers.

299
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,396
I'm only in it for the money. That's it.

300
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:02,190
I'll tell you everything. I've been dying
to tell someone about their bullshit.

301
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,568
All right, we get it.
Please get to the point now.

302
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:06,611
Based on what I heard on the phone,

303
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:08,822
they're fighting with Iil Group
over the contract,

304
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:11,658
so Kim Myeong-gil
is really pissed off lately.

305
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,201
And?

306
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,495
Kim Jun-min is tight with this guy,
Im Jang-do.

307
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:16,580
He's an asshole too.

308
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,958
He was in charge of dealing with the cops,
but he just disappeared one day.

309
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:23,044
And recently, Kim Myeong-gil was drinking
at a hostess bar,

310
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:25,839
got into a fight with some dude,
and ended up breaking his wrist.

311
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:28,758
So the cops were called in,
and it was a whole scene,

312
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:30,802
but they swept it all under the rug.

313
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:34,514
That doesn't usually happen
when the police are called to a scene.

314
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:36,433
So from what Kim Jun-min said,

315
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:39,186
Kim Myeong-gil has found a guy
to replace Im Jang-do.

316
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:41,605
Apparently, he hasn't told anyone
about it yet.

317
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,440
Why?

318
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:45,233
Because he doesn't trust his own men.

319
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:47,486
And?

320
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:50,864
And he also plans on taking over
a golf course in Gyeonggi-do.

321
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:53,408
That's the reason
why we're busting our balls out here.

322
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,744
We get paid shit,
but they practically work us like mules.

323
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:57,412
Right, guys?

324
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:00,999
And that concludes my updates for the day.

325
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:04,669
Hold on.

326
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:15,972
You know you're fucked
if we send this to Kim Jun-min.

327
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:17,140
Keep your mouth shut.

328
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,517
No need to worry, sir.

329
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:21,811
If you need anything else,
feel free to get in touch.

330
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:24,648
Just like you, I'd like to see
Smile Capital crash and burn.

331
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:27,901
So do you think you'll be able to get us
the phone number Iil Group's eldest son?

332
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:30,403
Oh, no, I don't think I can do that.

333
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:33,698
People like them are pretty serious
about their privacy.

334
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:35,116
Oh.

335
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:37,327
IIL GROUP CHAIRMAN'S ELDEST SON

336
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:42,541
IIL GROUP HEIR
CONFIDENT TO DEVELOP A GLOBAL HOTEL

337
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:46,378
Oh, his name is Hong Min-beom.
He has the same last name as me.

338
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:50,632
Bro, this proves that Seoul has
the best jajangmyeon, right?

339
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:53,385
Yeah.

340
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:59,307
Why are you using my computer
without permission?

341
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,726
It's logged into all of my messenger apps.

342
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,646
We're so sorry.
We didn't open any messenger apps.

343
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:07,482
Go to that café next door.

344
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,359
Okay. We're sorry.

345
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:11,778
- Turn it off.
- Got it.

346
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:13,280
But how about just this once?

347
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:15,407
Hurry.

348
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:16,825
Yeah, that's all.

349
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:18,994
- Sorry again.
- Ugh.

350
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:22,706
How did she find out?

351
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:26,209
Uh, the messenger app must've alerted her
when we turned on the computer.

352
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:27,127
Mm. Mm.

353
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:36,386
Whoa!

354
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:38,096
- Damn. Look.
- What?

355
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:41,266
Hong Min-beom has 500,000 followers.

356
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:43,685
Let's see now.

357
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:04,331
Whoa! Stop, stop, stop, stop!

358
00:27:29,105 --> 00:27:29,981
Didn't I say…

359
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:35,528
to have the contract ready by today,
so I could spend the money?

360
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:38,031
I tried my best,

361
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:40,909
but my father--

362
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:57,926
Hey, Beom.

363
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:13,942
Please don't kill me.
Please don't. Please.

364
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:17,487
Do what I asked you to,

365
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,906
and deliver the contract to me
by this Friday.

366
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:21,825
If you don't, I'll release the video.

367
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:25,036
And I will make it look as if
you threw yourself off a building

368
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,329
because of the footage.

369
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:31,918
Yes. Yes.

370
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,592
Do you want to get rid of Kim Myeong-gil?

371
00:29:21,134 --> 00:29:22,343
We can help you.

372
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:25,263
What the fuck? Who are these guys?

373
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:31,728
WE KNOW WHERE THE HARD DRIVE
CONTAINING YOUR FOOTAGE IS LOCATED

374
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:34,272
Let's just meet them.

375
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:36,149
We better do it quickly.

376
00:29:36,858 --> 00:29:38,359
The contract is due on Friday.

377
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:41,029
Then ask if they can meet us now.

378
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:42,572
What do I do if they say yes?

379
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:44,157
Have them meet you at the bar you like.

380
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,367
They'll show their true colors
once they drink.

381
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:49,621
Oh, shit.

382
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,666
Don't worry.
I can get two of my guys to follow you.

383
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:08,348
Hey, In-seong.

384
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:09,599
- Yes, sir.
- Tastes good, right?

385
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:11,017
Oh, yes!

386
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,393
I told you not to drink.

387
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:14,562
Uh, right.

388
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:18,566
Come on. They're here.

389
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,822
- Hello, sir. Hello, sir.
- Hello, sir.

390
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:30,495
Hey, guys. I'm Min-beom's cousin.

391
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:32,664
Oh, I'm Kim Gun-woo.

392
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:36,042
And I'm Hong Woo-jin.
I'm the one who sent you the DM.

393
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:38,670
Have a seat.

394
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,214
Yes, sir.

395
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:48,805
Let's talk over a few drinks
if you guys don't mind.

396
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:52,308
Uh…

397
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,145
Uh, I'm really sorry,

398
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,148
but I was attacked and stabbed
by Kim Myeong-gil's men

399
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:01,943
and they tore my liver, so I can't drink.

400
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:06,155
If you don't want to drink,

401
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,658
you can just say so, you know?

402
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:16,124
I’m not lying.

403
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:18,209
Here, here,

404
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:20,378
here.

405
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:23,339
We get it, yeah.

406
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:25,592
Okay, pull it down.
It’s a disturbing sight.

407
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:27,677
Why don't you sit this one out?

408
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:29,596
Were you stabbed too?

409
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:32,390
Well, actually,
I just don't drink alcohol, sir.

410
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:37,478
We’re about to talk about serious stuff.
Let's drink.

411
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:44,652
Well, what is the point
of us meeting here then

412
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,487
if we're not gonna be open
with each other?

413
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:49,574
How can we trust you
if you back out of something so trivial?

414
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:51,075
And to be blunt,

415
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:55,204
you asked to meet up
because you also need us.

416
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,132
- I’m sure I can have just one drink.
- No!

417
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:08,843
I'll be the one to…
to have a couple drinks with you.

418
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:13,473
All right.

419
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:17,352
Min-beom.

420
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:19,604
All right.

421
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:26,361
Now, let's drink.

422
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:30,657
Cheers.

423
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:32,241
Cheers.

424
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:42,961
Damn, you're a natural.

425
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,421
Let’s drink from the tall glasses.

426
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:46,923
These ones are too short.

427
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:48,508
This is the right way.

428
00:32:48,591 --> 00:32:49,968
- Okay.
- Here.

429
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:51,594
There we go.

430
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:42,395
Mm.

431
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:43,896
Hey, dude. Whoa!

432
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,523
- Slow down.
- Mm-hm.

433
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:56,659
Much more relaxed now.

434
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:02,915
Shit.

435
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:34,655
This is fun.

436
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,075
No, hey, listen to me. Hey, man.

437
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:38,785
I'm so stressed by that son of a bitch.

438
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:40,703
I knew you were cool
when you raised your shirt.

439
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:43,081
- I'm your bro.
- Yeah.

440
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:45,333
- Yeah, you're my bro. Pour me another.
- Yes, sir!

441
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:48,544
Because of that stupid asshole…

442
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:52,590
…I lost so much hair from the stress.

443
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:55,009
I have hemorrhoids.

444
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:58,262
Earlier he punched me
before I could even speak.

445
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:04,185
The police commissioner fucking loves me!

446
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:06,646
When we're together,
he calls me commissioner.

447
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:09,190
I'm like, "Hey, bro!
Stop calling me that."

448
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:11,400
"People are gonna get the wrong idea."

449
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:16,405
Bro, we have to take care of this kid.

450
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:18,658
He's family. He's good. He's a good kid.

451
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:22,161
Woo-jin and Gun-woo,
do whatever the hell you want.

452
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:25,164
Fuck it, all right.
We've got your back till the end of time.

453
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:26,499
Should I pour you another, sir?

454
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:28,251
- I can't drink anymore.
- Okay.

455
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:29,919
I can't because I have hemorrhoids.

456
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:32,171
I work too much.

457
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:34,257
We should keep drinking.

458
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,736
Oh, shit.

459
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:06,998
Bro.

460
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,132
What the hell?

461
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:19,969
Oh, good morning, Min-beom.

462
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:22,805
Did you sleep well?

463
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:26,392
What's going on?

464
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:30,146
Uh, you brought us over last night

465
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:32,273
saying we should have a few more drinks
at your place.

466
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:33,191
Oh.

467
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,568
We were about to wake you up
for instant noodles.

468
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:37,069
- To cure the hangover.
- Uh-huh.

469
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:37,987
Have a seat.

470
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:40,865
- Gun-woo, take this.
- All right.

471
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:42,867
- And I can go wake up Gang-yong.
- Okay.

472
00:36:42,950 --> 00:36:44,952
Uh, how much did I drink?

473
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:49,957
Gun-ho?

474
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:52,960
Gun-woo.

475
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:53,961
Oh.

476
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,423
What are we doing?

477
00:36:57,506 --> 00:36:59,383
Oh, Gang-yong is going to communicate

478
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:01,469
with a computer expert
from the police agency.

479
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:03,512
That person will hack
Kim Myeong-gil's phone,

480
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:05,765
and then we'll burn all of the hard drives
in the safe.

481
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:07,850
The noodles are done.
You should eat, bro.

482
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:10,102
Gang-yong, get up.

483
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,355
When Kim Myeong-gil goes to Iil Group

484
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:14,106
to meet you this Friday
to sign a contract,

485
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:15,358
that's when you're gonna do it.

486
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:16,317
Who is?

487
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:19,278
You.

488
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:22,865
Right. Of course it's me.
Yeah, let's just eat.

489
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:25,117
How much did I drink?

490
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:27,662
Whoa! Be careful.

491
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:32,458
- Oh!
- Ah, nice.

492
00:37:32,541 --> 00:37:33,501
Enjoy.

493
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:39,632
Mm.

494
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:42,593
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for this meal.

495
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,769
It's been so long
since I had this.

496
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:02,196
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

497
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:04,407
It's huge.

498
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:06,784
It's so tall.

499
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:08,202
How many stories is this?

500
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:11,539
Thank you.

501
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:13,916
- Hello. Hello, sir.
- You're here.

502
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,626
- Hi, everyone
- Hello.

503
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:16,627
Hi.

504
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:20,131
- Hello.
- Let me introduce you to my team.

505
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:24,427
Go ahead.

506
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,179
Detective Yoon Han-gu.

507
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:28,222
Nice to meet you.

508
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:30,975
- Hi.
- Hello.

509
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:34,520
I'm Team Leader Kang Tae-yeong
from Cyber Crimes.

510
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:37,064
I'm not supposed to be here,
but nice to meet you.

511
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,274
- Oh.
- Oh.

512
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:42,486
Let's also keep my presence a secret.
We're all here in secret.

513
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:43,529
Okay.

514
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:47,199
Anyway, Tae-yeong is the leading
cybersecurity expert in the country.

515
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:49,243
She'll explain
how to hack Myeong-gil's phone,

516
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,787
and then she'll lead you through the steps
to activate the safe.

517
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:55,416
Right. There are two ways to do it,
and the first way is to use Wi-Fi, yeah?

518
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,251
So I'll install a jammer
in the meeting room,

519
00:38:57,335 --> 00:39:00,421
and that will temporarily block
Internet access.

520
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:03,758
That will naturally lead the subject
to reconnect to the Wi-Fi again,

521
00:39:03,841 --> 00:39:05,801
but the moment he connects
to the transmitter I made,

522
00:39:05,885 --> 00:39:07,762
I'll be able to access his phone device.

523
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:10,056
And once I do, it's game over.

524
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:11,640
I've also researched
the different safe apps

525
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:13,225
that he's likely to be using.

526
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:14,935
As for the second method,

527
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:18,356
it depends if we can get him
to open up a more direct route for us.

528
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:20,399
You know how these days
we scan personal QR codes

529
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:21,734
when entering buildings.

530
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:23,444
I'll make one to post at the entrance.

531
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:24,403
ELECTRONIC ACCESS LIST

532
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:25,363
Then have him scan it.

533
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:26,989
Once that QR code has been scanned,

534
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:29,367
it'll open a door
for me to again hack into his phone.

535
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,702
We will be using both methods
at the same time, yeah?

536
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:33,162
Wait.

537
00:39:35,998 --> 00:39:37,249
What do I have to do?

538
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:41,420
Uh… you just need to make sure
he stays connected to the Wi-Fi

539
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:42,755
for as long as possible.

540
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:45,925
I'll have access to his cloud,
but depending on the size,

541
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:48,552
it could take some time
to rake all of the data, you know?

542
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:49,720
If we're lucky,

543
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:52,848
we may be able to get evidence
for all of his crimes

544
00:39:52,932 --> 00:39:54,308
and catch his accomplices.

545
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:55,976
Whoa.

546
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,645
But what if…

547
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:01,107
that bastard catches on?

548
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:03,401
What's our backup plan?

549
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:09,156
We're using both methods at once
to avoid needing a backup plan.

550
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,991
Oh, come on, dude.

551
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:14,078
What is this? Seriously!

552
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:16,997
No matter what it takes,

553
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:20,292
we have to destroy
that fucking hard drive tomorrow.

554
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:23,003
If it was up to me,
I would just take his phone.

555
00:40:23,629 --> 00:40:25,589
Should be easy. Not so complicated.

556
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,675
What's with all the technical details?

557
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:30,428
Maybe I can take his phone.

558
00:40:31,011 --> 00:40:31,887
Han-gu.

559
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:39,103
Uh, may I ask what's on the hard drive?

560
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:40,521
Oh, shit.

561
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:42,064
You don't need to know.

562
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:44,817
Got it?

563
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:46,360
Yeah.

564
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:52,491
Min-beom, let's get some air.

565
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:16,807
Min-beom.

566
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:19,018
You must be nervous.

567
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:22,188
I know it's a difficult operation.

568
00:41:23,063 --> 00:41:25,357
And, of course,
there are also a lot of limitations.

569
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:26,734
Bro.

570
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:31,822
If we don't erase that hard drive,
I'll never be free of Kim Myeong-gil.

571
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:33,032
I'll be fucked.

572
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:35,451
That's why I am going to try my hardest.

573
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:37,578
Please trust me a little more.

574
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:45,169
I'll try.

575
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:09,777
Whoa. It's gone.

576
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:17,076
It's gonna work?

577
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:17,993
Of course.

578
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:58,951
Please take your temperature here.

579
00:43:01,537 --> 00:43:03,080
Scan the QR code with your phone.

580
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:06,166
Shouldn't it be the other way around?

581
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,210
This is how our building does it, Miss.

582
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:11,505
That's unusual but okay.

583
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:21,390
So far so good.

584
00:43:33,152 --> 00:43:35,237
- Okay.
- Yes!

585
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,452
Oh.

586
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:43,495
What's wrong? What?

587
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:45,789
There's seems to be nothing
in the file folders.

588
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:46,790
Give me a second.

589
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:58,886
The, uh, the safe app you had mentioned,
it's not here.

590
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:04,058
Are you sure the information was right?

591
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:05,100
Yeah.

592
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:06,810
Jang-do was not in a position to lie.

593
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:11,649
Is this asshole onto us?

594
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:21,450
Oh well.

595
00:44:23,118 --> 00:44:25,496
Director Hong.

596
00:44:26,413 --> 00:44:27,706
How are you?

597
00:44:49,478 --> 00:44:51,397
Oh shit.

598
00:44:53,982 --> 00:44:57,945
- What?
- There's no safe app on his phone.

599
00:45:17,923 --> 00:45:19,299
This fucker has two phones.

600
00:45:20,759 --> 00:45:21,927
What do you mean?

601
00:45:22,010 --> 00:45:23,679
The phone he used
to scan the QR code was black,

602
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:25,431
but this one's silver.

603
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:26,724
- Ah.
- Ah.

604
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:29,435
So what do we do now?

605
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:31,395
We just need
to get him to connect to the Wi-Fi.

606
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:43,240
Sir, he's leaving the room.

607
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:49,997
I'm fine. Don't worry.

608
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,957
- Do you need something? Okay.
- I said I'm fine.

609
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:01,216
What happened?

610
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,552
Kim Myeong-gil has two phones.

611
00:46:03,635 --> 00:46:05,763
The one we managed to get into
didn't have the safe app.

612
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:08,599
The phone with the app is in that pouch.

613
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:10,142
And?

614
00:46:11,518 --> 00:46:13,353
We're still trying to figure out
what to do.

615
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:16,231
There's not enough time left.
The meeting is wrapping up.

616
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:21,570
Why don't we talk in private for a second?

617
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:22,821
Oh, shit.

618
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:25,741
Tae-yeong, Han-gu.

619
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:28,035
Could you guys give us
just a minute, please?

620
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:29,495
Uh, yeah.

621
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:37,419
Min-beom, what did Im Jang-do use
to take the video?

622
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:39,171
A cell phone.

623
00:46:39,254 --> 00:46:42,216
Isn't there a chance he would've sent
that video to Kim Myeong-gil's phone?

624
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:43,801
You mean to get confirmation?

625
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:44,885
Right.

626
00:46:44,968 --> 00:46:48,388
Before you sign the contract,
instruct him to delete the video first.

627
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:49,306
Simple as that.

628
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:52,184
Then Kim Myeong-gil will have no choice
but to take out his phone.

629
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:53,227
What if he doesn't?

630
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:55,646
What if he says he didn't receive it?

631
00:46:56,772 --> 00:47:00,108
You should ask him to show you
his entire chat history with Im Jang-do.

632
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:03,028
And tell him that Im Jang-do said
he was going to send it to him.

633
00:47:03,111 --> 00:47:04,530
You serious?

634
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:06,740
Criminals like Kim Myeong-gil
trust no one.

635
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:10,410
In order to check
that Im Jang-do finished the job properly,

636
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:12,913
he would have asked him
to send the video for proof.

637
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:22,881
I don't think I can.

638
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:26,969
You can trust me.

639
00:47:27,052 --> 00:47:28,011
That's not it.

640
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:31,640
I don't think I have what it takes
to stand up to him.

641
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:36,478
I'm scared!

642
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:41,316
Fuck, just looking at him
makes my hands shake!

643
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:49,116
Min-beom.

644
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:56,790
Look, you will be able to do this.

645
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:01,086
I will kick down those doors
at the first sign of trouble.

646
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:03,839
And if things get out of hand
at any point,

647
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:07,843
I will use all of our family's resources
to protect you.

648
00:48:10,345 --> 00:48:12,222
So please muster up your courage, okay?

649
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:21,273
Min-beom, we will barge in there with him.

650
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:22,858
You can do it.

651
00:48:43,795 --> 00:48:45,756
You sure kept us waiting, didn't you?

652
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:47,633
What were you doing?

653
00:48:48,884 --> 00:48:50,594
Could the lawyers please step out?

654
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:53,388
I need a moment in private with Mr. Kim.

655
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:55,015
Okay.

656
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,697
I'm sure you don't want to be arrested.

657
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:21,416
What's with… this bravado?

658
00:49:21,917 --> 00:49:23,085
Erase the video

659
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:25,796
before we sign the contract.

660
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:28,966
It's not here.

661
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:32,719
I'll delete it as soon as I get home.

662
00:49:32,803 --> 00:49:33,804
You have my word.

663
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:36,890
Don't bother lying.

664
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:40,560
I know that your guy sent it
to your phone.

665
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:45,524
I want to see you delete it.

666
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:24,938
- I'll do it now.
- No.

667
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:27,983
I'm going to delete it myself.

668
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:29,901
I don't trust you.

669
00:50:31,611 --> 00:50:32,654
And if I refuse?

670
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:35,699
Then I'm not signing.

671
00:50:37,159 --> 00:50:38,326
You must be crazy.

672
00:50:40,454 --> 00:50:41,288
Well…

673
00:50:43,331 --> 00:50:46,209
You think my family will sit still
if you lay a finger on me?

674
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:48,754
I've been so embarrassed,

675
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:52,215
so I've been trying to take care of this
on my own.

676
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:57,054
But… my aunt runs the tax department.

677
00:50:57,137 --> 00:50:58,430
One phone call from me,

678
00:50:58,513 --> 00:51:00,974
and within 24 hours,
your company will be audited.

679
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:01,892
So,

680
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:04,686
you want to pay tens of billions in taxes?

681
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:06,521
You want to go there? Huh?

682
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:15,947
You've become more eloquent.

683
00:51:17,824 --> 00:51:19,201
At least with your threats.

684
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:21,036
I learned from you.

685
00:51:25,373 --> 00:51:26,333
I like it.

686
00:51:29,503 --> 00:51:30,378
Well, I don't.

687
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:50,941
WI-FI OFF

688
00:51:51,024 --> 00:51:52,734
WI-FI ON

689
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:57,322
We're in.

690
00:51:58,490 --> 00:51:59,574
Okay, give me a second.

691
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:06,289
Ah!

692
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:07,374
The safe app.

693
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:08,291
It is here.

694
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:09,668
- Yes!
- Hell yeah!

695
00:52:09,751 --> 00:52:11,336
- Okay
- Shh!

696
00:52:11,419 --> 00:52:13,338
All right, I will break in now, okay?

697
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:21,805
Will that be all, Mr. Hong?

698
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:24,599
Now we can sign.

699
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:38,405
Okay. Should I go ahead with it now?

700
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,084
Do it.

701
00:52:51,168 --> 00:52:52,169
Okay.

702
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:58,341
TOTAL INCINERATION IN PROCESS

703
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:12,230
It's done.

704
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:13,523
Yes.

705
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:16,401
- Hey, are you 100% sure that it worked?
- Yes, definitely.

706
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:19,696
- Oh, thank you.
- I'll extract all of the data right now.

707
00:53:19,779 --> 00:53:21,740
Okay, yeah, extract it. Extract it all.

708
00:53:24,117 --> 00:53:25,327
This is all thanks to you two.

709
00:53:25,410 --> 00:53:27,037
- Oh, not at all.
- Not at all.

710
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,622
We'll gather all the evidence
on that phone,

711
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:31,666
and that bastard Kim Myeong-gil
will end up behind bars, so don't worry.

712
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:32,876
- Great.
- Great.

713
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:45,138
Thanks for your hard work.
Gang-yong will be in touch.

714
00:53:45,222 --> 00:53:47,057
- Okay, thank you.
- Thank you.

715
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:49,768
There's something
I've been thinking about.

716
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:52,270
Your wound, your scars.

717
00:53:53,355 --> 00:53:54,981
I'd like to help you get treatment for it.

718
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:57,859
Oh, I really appreciate it,

719
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:00,445
but I'm okay.

720
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:01,988
Are you sure?

721
00:54:02,072 --> 00:54:02,906
Yes.

722
00:54:02,989 --> 00:54:07,994
Thanks to this scar,
I was able to meet some amazing people,

723
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:11,206
and it gave me the strength to carry on
instead of giving up.

724
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:14,668
So I…

725
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:16,169
I'm okay with my scars.

726
00:54:17,003 --> 00:54:17,921
I understand.

727
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:20,048
I'll see you guys soon.

728
00:54:20,131 --> 00:54:21,758
- Okay.
- Okay.

729
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:23,718
Please walk them out.

730
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:25,011
- Yes, sir.
- I'll say bye here.

731
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:27,555
- Okay, thank you.
- Bye. Thank you.

732
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:33,019
- Thank god it ended well.
- I know, right?

733
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:37,816
- I knew things would go well.
- Uh-huh.

734
00:54:40,360 --> 00:54:42,112
- Oh, and Gun-woo.
- Hm?

735
00:54:42,195 --> 00:54:46,449
Do you remember when Mr. Choi asked
Im Jang-do about the gold bars?

736
00:54:47,492 --> 00:54:50,412
Yeah, uh, about how
only In-beom knows where they are.

737
00:54:51,037 --> 00:54:53,123
Yeah. How much do you think it's worth?

738
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:55,625
I don't know.

739
00:54:56,876 --> 00:54:59,379
My guess is
somewhere around tens of billions.

740
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:01,423
Wow.

741
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:05,927
That includes the money
he stole from Mr. Choi, right?

742
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:06,845
Right.

743
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:09,931
If the cops let Kim Myeong-gil
slip away again,

744
00:55:10,932 --> 00:55:12,642
he's gonna take the money and gold

745
00:55:13,810 --> 00:55:15,103
and leave the country.

746
00:55:16,062 --> 00:55:19,107
We can't let that happen.
That money belongs to Mr. Choi.

747
00:55:19,607 --> 00:55:20,567
Let's get ready.

748
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:23,778
Let's chase him down to the end
and maul him to death.

749
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:24,988
I'm in.

750
00:55:32,954 --> 00:55:35,081
- Yes, sir!
- Woo!

751
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:38,293
- Beom, Jun-min, good work, you guys!
- Sir!

752
00:55:38,376 --> 00:55:41,338
Man, let's go for round two at my place.

753
00:55:44,257 --> 00:55:45,383
Woo! We're here.

754
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:47,010
Don't you smell something?

755
00:55:49,095 --> 00:55:51,389
Hm, it does kind of smell like smoke.

756
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:55,393
Quiet.

757
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:00,273
Don't.

758
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:20,335
Fucker!

759
00:56:26,508 --> 00:56:27,467
Go.

760
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:39,938
CHOI TAE-HO

761
00:56:58,248 --> 00:57:00,667
- Where are you?
- Working overtime, sir.

762
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:03,878
I'll send a driver
with a phone over right now.

763
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:05,964
I need you to find someone.

764
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:09,050
- How many people?
- For now, just an old man.

765
00:57:09,634 --> 00:57:10,510
How urgent is this?

766
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:12,470
If you find him by tomorrow at noon,

767
00:57:13,388 --> 00:57:14,639
I'll pay you triple.

768
00:57:16,474 --> 00:57:17,725
All right, sir.
