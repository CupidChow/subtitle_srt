1
00:00:18,727 --> 00:00:21,146
BOSS

2
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:02,854
BLOODHOUNDS

3
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:05,857
Fuck.

4
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,109
Who is this guy?

5
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:17,660
Kill him!

6
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:21,247
Get me the address

7
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,541
of the woman who runs the café
in the Seongeun Building.

8
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:54,155
Come here, you son of a bitch!

9
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:55,573
Come on.

10
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,450
Damn you, you fuck nuggets, man!

11
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,475
We've got them!

12
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:43,663
Goddammit!

13
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:48,585
You sons of bitches!

14
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,253
Come here!

15
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,257
Get down!

16
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:15,778
Fuck him up!

17
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:28,625
You little bitch!

18
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:31,961
You bastard!

19
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,567
- Motherfuckers.
- Sons of bitches!

20
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:23,072
- Let's go.
- Okay.

21
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:25,116
- Come on!
- Right.

22
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,580
Thanks for coming, Hyeon-ju.

23
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,001
You saved us quite a beating.

24
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:38,212
God, that hurts.

25
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,978
Gun-woo, is that you?

26
00:06:05,948 --> 00:06:07,241
Gun-woo?

27
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:24,675
It's all right.

28
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:27,178
Shh.

29
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:29,639
Hurry up.

30
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:49,117
Hey, hurry up and move.

31
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,125
Hey.

32
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:06,426
God dammit,
who the fuck is he supposed to be?

33
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,429
You're so fucking annoying.

34
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:28,865
Fuck.

35
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,163
Shit.

36
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:05,693
Oh, fuck!

37
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:25,505
Fuck!

38
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,977
You fucker! Who are you?

39
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:56,035
Shut your stupid mouth.

40
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,209
Get up. Get up!

41
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:53,884
Would you look at that.

42
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:58,931
Hey.

43
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,017
Who the hell are you?

44
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:02,935
- Excuse me, sir.
- Hey.

45
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,813
I asked you a fucking question.

46
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,159
Sleep tight.

47
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:31,589
Huh? What the hell?

48
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:33,883
When did I get this?

49
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,603
MY LOVELY MOM

50
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:48,648
Yeah, Mom.

51
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,691
Gun-woo.

52
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,736
Mom, what's going on?
What happened? Why are you crying, Mom?

53
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:56,989
Someone wants to talk to you.

54
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,370
Where are you guys right now?

55
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:29,313
Gun-woo, dear.

56
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:30,314
Hey.

57
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,653
Mom, what happened to your forehead?

58
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,488
It's all right. I just…

59
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:40,074
I just bumped my head into something.

60
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,663
Your face…

61
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,419
What happened?
Woo-jin, what happened to your face?

62
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,213
Oh, uh, it's just a scratch. This…

63
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,842
Mr. Choi's been worried sick
waiting for you.

64
00:11:57,925 --> 00:11:59,301
He's downstairs.

65
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:00,845
- Okay.
- Okay.

66
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,182
I'll be back.

67
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:10,563
Come here and sit down!

68
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:20,698
I'm sure you're all tired,
so I'll keep this short.

69
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:25,411
When I got your call,

70
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,622
it felt like
the world was crumbling around me.

71
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,792
You are my family.

72
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:36,130
I was terrified… that I might lose you.

73
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,091
No more dangerous schemes.

74
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:40,760
Got it?

75
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:41,969
Let the adults handle it.

76
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:45,097
- But I… I also want to help.
- Gun-woo.

77
00:12:45,681 --> 00:12:49,685
This here isn't a match
with a winner and a loser.

78
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:53,272
This is a war
that will only end when someone's dead.

79
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:58,903
You two go upstairs.

80
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:10,748
I'm sorry.

81
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:13,459
I don't want you to ever get involved
in something like that.

82
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:15,002
Okay.

83
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,881
Now they know where Gun-woo lives,
so they can't go back there.

84
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:21,634
Take Gun-woo's mother
to the shelter tomorrow.

85
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:24,220
For the time being,
it will be safer to stay there.

86
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:26,472
Okay.

87
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:28,891
Good night.

88
00:13:37,942 --> 00:13:39,902
What do we do now, Yang-jung?

89
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:43,864
I can make this end.

90
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:49,119
It's something we should've already done.

91
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,831
You think you can get Myeong-gil?

92
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:54,250
I'll get started moving
with Du-yeong tomorrow.

93
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:56,544
We'll pick them off one by one.

94
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:58,504
Let's have a meal with Du-yeong.

95
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:00,339
Uh, Mr. Oh, do me a favor.

96
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:02,800
Please look into Myeong-gil's men.
Let me know what you find.

97
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:03,759
Yes, sir.

98
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:34,767
Oh, Mr. Director.

99
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,268
You're here so early in the morning.

100
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:39,188
It seemed fitting
seeing as how you were coming, Mr. Kim.

101
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:41,315
I operated on them myself.

102
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:42,816
Oh, thank you.

103
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:46,862
One of them had both
of his Achilles tendons cut with a knife.

104
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:50,950
And the other one had all the tendons
in his shoulders severed.

105
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,589
He had short hair

106
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,133
and slanted eyes.

107
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,220
He was quick on his feet.

108
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:14,181
And he was really good with a knife.

109
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,395
Hm?

110
00:16:19,478 --> 00:16:20,688
Yeah, uh,

111
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,941
I think it was a sashimi knife.

112
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:28,237
Shit.

113
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:35,744
Tell Beom
he needs to get to the office by 1:00.

114
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,788
- Let's have a meeting.
- Yes, sir.

115
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:41,083
Things just got interesting.

116
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:52,177
- Finish this.
- Oh, okay.

117
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:56,432
- Sir.
- Yes?

118
00:16:58,517 --> 00:16:59,810
I'm coming with you.

119
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:02,396
You stay.

120
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,898
I'd like to help you, sir.

121
00:17:04,982 --> 00:17:06,233
Min-dong.

122
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:09,194
I'll take care of it myself.

123
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,822
You just live your life.

124
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:15,367
But… I really want to help you out, sir.

125
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:16,535
Listen,

126
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:20,330
if I find the restaurant is in ruins
by the time I return to work,

127
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:21,290
you'll get in trouble.

128
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,752
Keep the restaurant running.
That's how you can help me.

129
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:26,920
But still--

130
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:30,883
Stay here.

131
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,056
Hwang Yang-jung!

132
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:20,808
It's been so long.

133
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:22,643
God, why haven't you been in touch?

134
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:24,103
I was busy making a living.

135
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,897
Man, why has your handsome face
aged so much?

136
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,774
Making an honest living is not easy.

137
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:29,983
Right?

138
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:31,819
It's hard to do it honestly, no?

139
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:35,572
- Man, it's so good to see you.
- Yes.

140
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:39,535
I called Su-cheol and Min-su
to have them look into it.

141
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:41,370
This is a pretty big deal.

142
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:45,958
These guys…
aren't your average loan sharks.

143
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,169
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

144
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:55,843
A friend in Yeouido overheard

145
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:59,847
Iil Group purchased
an unfinished hotel building in Gangnam.

146
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:02,432
And they got the cash from Smile Capital.

147
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:05,477
- Kim Myeong-gil's company, right?
- Yeah.

148
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,315
But why would a corporate magnate borrow
from Kim Myeong-gil? I don't get that?

149
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,111
Well, Myeong-gil probably tricked them.

150
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:17,156
- Let's find out.
- Mm.

151
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:22,161
Finally avenging our boys.

152
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:24,872
Let's end this.

153
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,166
Mr. Choi gave us his approval.

154
00:19:30,002 --> 00:19:30,836
Mm.

155
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:36,300
Back in the day, President Choi
had five knifers working for him.

156
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:39,928
During that time,
he would lend money to corporations,

157
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,431
so he often had
10 billion won or more uncollected.

158
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:44,558
But places like construction companies

159
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:47,936
would always have gangs
that would be looking out for them.

160
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,646
That's when these guys would go.

161
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:53,317
They would go out
and obliterate an entire gang in a day.

162
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:57,654
Back then, even the big gangs were
terrified of President Choi's knifers.

163
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:02,409
When I finally got Choi out of the way,

164
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,913
the first thing Beom and I did
was get rid of the knifers.

165
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:08,248
And do you have an idea
of why we did that?

166
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:10,500
Uh, no.

167
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:14,838
Because I was scared as fuck too,
you know?

168
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,800
You and In-beom took them out alone?

169
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:23,347
We sent two gangs, one from Sindang-dong
and one from Yeongdeungpo, as a unit.

170
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,266
We were able to do it
because they weren't together at the time.

171
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,602
Otherwise, it would have been impossible.

172
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:30,520
Wow. That's amazing, sir.

173
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:31,855
But in the end,

174
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:35,901
I couldn't get rid of
the two most important ones.

175
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:40,113
Lee Du-yeong and Hwang Yang-jung.

176
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:43,742
President Choi's left and right-hand men.

177
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:50,207
Back when I was President Choi's lackey,
I once had a run-in with Lee Du-yeong.

178
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,166
He's handsome.

179
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:55,712
This one time,
a gang leader was stuck in traffic,

180
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:58,090
so he was having a smoke
with his window rolled down.

181
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:00,968
He heard a motorcycle approaching,
so he turned his head.

182
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:05,264
And Lee Du-yeong carved his face like this
with a sashimi knife.

183
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:07,474
Fuck, his mouth was bleeding,
flapping in the wind.

184
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:09,101
Shit, that's amazing.

185
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:12,104
Who's Hwang Yang-jung, sir?

186
00:21:12,187 --> 00:21:14,231
Well, they say

187
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:18,819
that he made cripples
out of 20 gang members

188
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:20,821
by severing their Achilles tendons solo.

189
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:24,950
I've also heard he uses two knives at once
and can stab a hundred times in a minute.

190
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:27,327
Crazy shit.

191
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:33,625
Did you say that three kids showed up?

192
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:36,545
Yes. A girl showed up about halfway.

193
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:40,215
And I think she's somehow connected
to that bookstore I mentioned to you.

194
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,637
It would make sense
if Choi owns the bookstore.

195
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:49,850
That senile fuck must have crawled out
of the shadows to save his kids.

196
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:54,104
Do you know
how much money President Choi has?

197
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:59,776
I'd guess, in cash, about 50 billion.

198
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:03,113
That could fully cover the money
we're short on, sir.

199
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:08,744
Well, I guess
someone up there's looking out for us.

200
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,957
Jang-do and Beom,
I want you to stake out the place

201
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:15,250
and bring me everything.

202
00:22:20,047 --> 00:22:22,049
LOVE ORPHANAGE

203
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:31,641
Oh!

204
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,227
Aren't you coming?

205
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:37,314
I don't want to go in. Make it quick.

206
00:22:38,231 --> 00:22:40,317
Suit yourself. We'll be right back, okay?

207
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,487
Kids, this way.

208
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:45,530
Come this way, please.

209
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:50,202
It's a children's room,
so it's a bit small.

210
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:52,871
But it should be all right.
Please take your time.

211
00:22:52,954 --> 00:22:53,997
Thank you.

212
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:16,395
What do you think, Mom?
There's Woo-jin.

213
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:18,105
Hello, ma'am.

214
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:27,656
A friend from grade school works for a guy
that works for Kim Myeong-gil,

215
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:29,783
so he was there
when things went down that day.

216
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,494
From what I heard, it got pretty scary.

217
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:34,913
They were waiting at the gas station,

218
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:36,665
and as soon as
that Iil Group heir came in,

219
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:38,917
they locked him up,
beat him, and threatened to kill him.

220
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:42,462
They must be the only guys in Korea

221
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:44,464
that would do that
to such a powerful family.

222
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,967
- And?
- And they got a video of the guy…

223
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:51,096
But like…

224
00:23:58,061 --> 00:24:01,148
This is Kim Jun-min,
the sales director at Smile Capital.

225
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:02,858
He has six priors for fraud.

226
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:05,277
Used car fraud, credit card payment fraud.

227
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:07,320
You name it, he's done it.

228
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:10,991
Apparently, he served
at Seoul Nambu Detention Center.

229
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:13,034
Im Jang-do.

230
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,953
He was a cadet in training

231
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:18,039
until he got kicked out
for sexual harassing a junior cadet.

232
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:18,999
He has no priors,

233
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:21,460
and he's the company's
head of strategic planning.

234
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:23,128
That's odd.

235
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:26,923
Having a guy who understands
exactly how the police operate

236
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:29,509
would really help them
avoid police investigations.

237
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:30,719
So, it's these two?

238
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:32,137
Yes.

239
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,722
You have their addresses?

240
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:35,891
Well, I have one for this guy.

241
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,101
He lives in Saseong-dong.

242
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:40,020
We know what car he drives
and the plate number.

243
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:42,522
We should get the jump on them fast.

244
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:45,275
They'll definitely catch on soon.

245
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:46,193
Yes.

246
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,987
This one. I'll take him.

247
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:53,992
- Let's go tomorrow night?
- But how far should we go?

248
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:56,536
What do you mean how far? Take them out.

249
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,082
I'll take care of Kim Myeong-gil.

250
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,001
There's always someone with him.

251
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:05,712
And he's good at manipulating.

252
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:07,422
Make sure
that you and Du-yeong go together.

253
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,091
I can just tail him.

254
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:14,888
Do you know if there was a really big guy
with Myeong-gil by any chance?

255
00:25:14,971 --> 00:25:16,014
Ah, yes.

256
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:19,601
The detective agency asked for more time
with that one.

257
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:22,354
I'll look into it more.

258
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:24,940
Who is he?

259
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:28,109
He's the one that threw me out the window,
and he's as strong as an ox.

260
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:35,116
Sir, what will you do
about the cash in the bookstore?

261
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,952
We have to move it.

262
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,787
This one knows the location.

263
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:41,748
Why don't we have the kids move the cash?

264
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:48,505
The thing is, we don't have time,
and we are short on manpower.

265
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:52,259
Uh, those kids are no joke.

266
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:55,136
- They mowed down 30 men.
- You saw it?

267
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:57,347
The men were all down when I got there.

268
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:00,850
Thirty men without even using knives. Wow.

269
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:01,935
Well, they're not your--

270
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:06,940
Sir, it should be fine
if they move it early in the morning.

271
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:08,567
Why don't you give them a chance?

272
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,527
Hyeon-ju's a smart kid too.

273
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:19,202
Okay, put it here.

274
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:20,245
Ah, yes!

275
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:21,746
Here.

276
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:25,834
- One more.
- Oh! Looks amazing.

277
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:28,628
Thank you for the meal!

278
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:30,005
Thank you for the meal.

279
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,590
- Thank you.
- Please enjoy everyone.

280
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:34,009
- Mm.
- Here you go, Hyeon-ju.

281
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,511
Oh, thank you.

282
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:38,263
- Oh!
- Mm.

283
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:46,688
Did you use our kimchi to make this?

284
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:47,606
Uh-huh.

285
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:51,693
Whoa. It tastes totally different
from when I make it.

286
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:55,113
It's not that hard. I can teach you.

287
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:57,365
Cool.

288
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:04,998
Oh, and I wanted to ask you something

289
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:09,836
about the… about the orphanage.
Does Mr. Choi control the whole place?

290
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:12,172
Uh, yes.

291
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,966
According to Grandpa,
he used to be very poor,

292
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:18,053
so his dream was to help those in need
when he made enough money.

293
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:19,304
Oh.

294
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:22,891
So, then are you Mr. Choi's granddaughter?

295
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,476
Uh… Uh, no.

296
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:28,104
I was placed in the orphanage
when my parents passed away.

297
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:29,814
Ah, I'm so sorry.

298
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,567
Oh, I shouldn't have brought that up now.

299
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:34,944
No, it's fine.

300
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:36,946
Mm, I'm sorry.

301
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,157
Uh…

302
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:41,618
What foods do you like, Hyeon-ju?

303
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:43,745
Well,

304
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:47,415
I really like rolled omelets.

305
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,959
Oh, then why don't you have some--

306
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:52,796
Hey, where are the rolled omelets?

307
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:57,217
My God, you two should have left some
for Hyeon-ju.

308
00:27:57,926 --> 00:27:59,135
Uh…

309
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,054
Oh.

310
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:05,850
That's right. I wanted rolled omelets.

311
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:11,481
I'll make some more. Don't worry.

312
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:12,565
Oh, no. That's all right.

313
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:14,901
Oh, no, no. This won't take long.
You just sit tight.

314
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:16,903
Make a big one, Mom, and make it thick.

315
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:18,321
All right, then.

316
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,614
A few.

317
00:28:19,698 --> 00:28:21,783
Okay, okay. I'll make them big.

318
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:25,286
Hurry up and eat.

319
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:35,547
THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW GO TO THE BOOKSTORE
AND GET ALL THE CASH OUT

320
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:53,773
KIM JUN-MIN

321
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:24,929
Take it easy.

322
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:53,333
- Did you pack everything?
- Yeah.

323
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,574
Jesus, man.

324
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:32,075
You two assemble the boxes.
I'll go get the money.

325
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:34,994
- How are we going to get these to the car?
- We can carry them.

326
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:37,747
No, that will take too long.
Hyeon-ju, do you have any trolleys?

327
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:40,458
Uh, go downstairs.
To the left, you'll see a storage room.

328
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:42,293
Woo-jin and I will get the trolleys.

329
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:45,338
Arrange the cash on the floor
while we're gone. Let's go.

330
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:59,078
Oh, you're a tough one.

331
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,905
Why are you taking your jacket off?

332
00:34:33,988 --> 00:34:35,239
Don't let him grab you.

333
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:37,408
- Who is he?
- The guy from the café.

334
00:34:38,409 --> 00:34:39,994
Fucker.

335
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,273
Hit and duck faster.

336
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:34,775
You little shit.

337
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:55,922
Low!

338
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:18,861
Shit.

339
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,165
You bitch!

340
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:11,182
Stop! That's enough.

341
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:13,642
Calm down.

342
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:19,148
It's okay.

343
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:21,609
It's over.

344
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:25,029
It's okay. It's okay.

345
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,410
- We have to tie him up. Okay.
- Yeah.

346
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,540
- Let's find something to tie him with!
- Okay.

347
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:42,213
- Hey, go look over there.
- Mm.

348
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:48,552
Ugh!

349
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:55,768
Whoa, dude!

350
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:58,145
Right.

351
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,274
Wait.

352
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:06,278
Whoa! What happened?

353
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:07,613
I don't know. I got in a fight.

354
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:08,572
You okay?

355
00:40:08,656 --> 00:40:10,908
It hurts like a bitch.

356
00:40:10,991 --> 00:40:14,829
Why did you tie his hands to the front?
That's going to come off easily.

357
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:17,415
- Really? I don't think so.
- So should I re-tie it?

358
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:19,750
Just hurry up and tie him.
Go get the trolley.

359
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:20,668
Okay.

360
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:22,711
Hold his feet.

361
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:27,967
All right. Let's go.

362
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,971
- Hurry up, dammit.
- Give it.

363
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:43,607
- Whoa.
- What? I had him cuffed right here.

364
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:49,280
I guess he got out
since you cuffed him to a pipe.

365
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:52,199
Looks like you should've
cuffed him properly, Hyeon-ju.

366
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:53,117
Why you little…

367
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:12,386
IM JANG-DO

368
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:16,557
♪ I got this pain deep in… ♪

369
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:17,641
About time.

370
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:20,227
We've run into a bit of a problem.

371
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:21,437
And the money?

372
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,898
Don't worry about that.
The money's still there.

373
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:25,524
And where are you going?

374
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:27,193
I couldn't get in touch with In-beom,

375
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:29,445
and my face is pretty torn up,

376
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:31,614
so I thought I'd drop by the ER

377
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:33,032
before going back in.

378
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:34,283
Did you?

379
00:41:34,783 --> 00:41:36,702
You should clean up your mess first.

380
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:38,704
Yes, you're right. I should, sir.

381
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:40,539
But my mouth is bleeding badly,

382
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:42,458
and my teeth are coming loose,
so I need to go--

383
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:44,376
Hey, you son of a bitch.

384
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:47,421
Call Jung, gather his men,
and take them down now.

385
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:51,884
I want these kids' heads.
Don't you dare just fucking sit there.

386
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:53,010
You understand?

387
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:56,972
Before I rip those kids' heads off,
should I chop off yours first?

388
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,225
I understand.

389
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:01,060
I do, sir.

390
00:42:13,656 --> 00:42:14,698
Move!

391
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:18,035
Hurry up, get in.

392
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:29,296
Throw it!

393
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:46,355
- Pop the trunk.
- Okay.

394
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:48,148
Push!

395
00:42:58,117 --> 00:42:59,493
Careful, careful, careful.

396
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:00,494
Hurry, hurry.

397
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:02,871
There we go.

398
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:06,375
Okay, we're done.

399
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:07,876
Fuck. We have to get the safe.

400
00:43:08,502 --> 00:43:10,879
- Don't we have to hurry up and get going?
- You can go ahead.

401
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:11,880
How much is in there?

402
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:13,465
Billions at the very least.

403
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:14,925
I'm gonna help you.

404
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:17,386
- Hey, you go ahead.
- Uh…

405
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:21,307
Dude, bro, there are billions on the line.

406
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:24,018
Go start the car and wait.
We'll be there before you know it.

407
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:25,227
You have to hurry.

408
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:30,608
There's a bag
underneath the cabinet.

409
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:31,525
Okay.

410
00:43:36,071 --> 00:43:37,740
Oh shit, a gold bar?

411
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:40,618
- Pack it up now!
- Oh.

412
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:47,416
Dollars?

413
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:50,878
- Don't just sit there, damn it.
- Got it.

414
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:16,987
The number you have--

415
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:23,160
Oh my, you don't look too good.

416
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:24,662
Are you okay?

417
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:28,582
Let's go.

418
00:44:42,763 --> 00:44:44,056
This bag is full.

419
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:45,516
Why do you have so much money?

420
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:48,727
Here we go.

421
00:44:49,311 --> 00:44:51,063
Hurry up!

422
00:44:51,146 --> 00:44:52,398
These are really heavy!

423
00:44:58,737 --> 00:44:59,613
Okay.

424
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:06,704
Mm.

425
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,850
We need to call Gun-woo.

426
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:32,771
Yeah?

427
00:45:33,605 --> 00:45:34,982
Stay on my tail.

428
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:36,316
Uh-huh.

429
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:48,871
Oh shit!

430
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:51,999
Shit!

431
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:19,443
Can we go any faster?

432
00:46:19,526 --> 00:46:21,779
I don't think I can.
The car's too weighed down right now.

433
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:23,530
When I give you the signal, step on it.

434
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:25,449
Yeah, I'll try.

435
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:31,705
Okay, now! Go now!

436
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:22,965
Come on, get in.

437
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:40,315
They're coming. Faster! Faster!

438
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:42,025
I can't. The car is acting up!

439
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:45,153
Push.

440
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:56,582
Oh shit!

441
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:16,935
Damn it. Hold on!

442
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:24,693
Hey! Are you okay?

443
00:48:26,486 --> 00:48:27,446
Whoa!

444
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,889
- Oh!
- Here we go!

445
00:49:09,988 --> 00:49:11,782
Push! Push! Push!

446
00:49:18,246 --> 00:49:20,165
More! More! More! More! More! More!\

447
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:25,504
Hello!

448
00:49:30,926 --> 00:49:32,219
Hey, go to the right!

449
00:49:36,264 --> 00:49:38,392
More! More! More! More! More! More!

450
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:48,610
Step on it!

451
00:49:52,030 --> 00:49:54,408
- Ugh, damn it.
- It's done for.

452
00:49:54,491 --> 00:49:55,409
Damn it.

453
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:59,204
The car's dead. Get out.
We need to get the bags.

454
00:50:07,462 --> 00:50:08,380
Run!

455
00:50:12,884 --> 00:50:13,885
Run!

456
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:38,785
Hey!

457
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:42,706
Run faster!
