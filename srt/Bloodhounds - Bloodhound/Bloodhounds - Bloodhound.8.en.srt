1
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:20,270
Damn it. Seriously?

2
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:21,521
CHOI TAE-HO

3
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:38,163
MR. OH, HWANG YANG-JUNG
LEE DU-YEONG, HYEON-JU

4
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:49,632
- Aren't you going home?
- I was just house-hunting, sir.

5
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:53,678
Man, it's not easy
buying a house nowadays.

6
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:55,221
Taking a honeymoon?

7
00:00:56,389 --> 00:01:00,060
My wants us to go to Paris,
but I don't think we'll go with COVID.

8
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:01,936
Ugh, goddamn COVID.

9
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:07,859
How come you're here so late, sir?

10
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:14,783
So, something big came in.

11
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:19,162
I've been keeping tabs on a loan shark
for about half a year now,

12
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:21,623
and this fucking asshole
takes videos of people,

13
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:23,541
so he has something to threaten them with.

14
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:27,754
And today I happened to receive
a list of all the asshole's victims.

15
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:29,380
I'll share it with you.

16
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:32,050
I'll organize the data,
and we can dive into it together.

17
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:35,261
Sounds good, sir.

18
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:37,931
- Get back to searching.
- Will do.

19
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:43,978
Mm.

20
00:01:44,062 --> 00:01:45,647
He said he got the list today.

21
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,608
He probably didn't do it alone.

22
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:52,612
Find me the asshole who helped him,
and I'll pay you 100 million per person.

23
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,948
Yes, sir.

24
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,659
When will you get Oh In-muk's location?

25
00:01:57,742 --> 00:02:00,161
I think I can find
his credit card locations

26
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:04,541
of the last seven days…
probably by tomorrow morning.

27
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,503
I'll pay you as soon as I receive it.
Good luck.

28
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,343
A hundred million.

29
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:18,638
What's up?,

30
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,476
The only person who knew
where hard drive was, was Jang-do.

31
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,646
The asshole must have snitched
when President Choi nabbed him.

32
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:32,861
The fuckers who were with him
teamed up with Hong. Fucking shithead.

33
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:34,320
Oppa.

34
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,783
You said there's only one hard drive?

35
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,203
There's only one hard drive.

36
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:47,208
But everything's backed up on a laptop

37
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:50,128
that we use to transfer the videos
to the drive.

38
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:53,590
Oh!

39
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:57,218
For now, we should just stay put.

40
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,847
If we release that video
at the wrong time,

41
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:06,394
then that son of a bitch, Hong,
is going to hit us with a tax audit.

42
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:07,812
Stupid motherfucker.

43
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:11,733
Oppa,

44
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:16,237
wouldn't it be better to let them know
you still have the video?

45
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:20,491
You need to scare them.

46
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,499
You're a smart cookie, aren't you?

47
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:30,543
A toast!

48
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,253
- And cheers!
- Cheers!

49
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:39,052
ADDRESS, MART
GAS STATION, RICE STORE

50
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:58,696
GOHEUNG GROCERIES

51
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:00,782
Have you seen this person before?

52
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:02,283
Uh, I'm not sure.

53
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:05,286
Our customers walk around in masks,
so it's hard to tell.

54
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,664
Oh, yeah? Is that so?

55
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:09,374
Ah, fuck me.

56
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:11,793
Right, take another look.

57
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:16,798
Oh.

58
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:18,341
I really don't know.

59
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:19,676
You think this is funny?

60
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:22,720
- Excuse me?
- Do you think this is fucking funny?

61
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,222
Uh, no, that's not what I--

62
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,849
Goddammit.

63
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:28,768
Eyes down, shithead.

64
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,562
Look. Do you know him?

65
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:32,689
I… I don't know.

66
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:36,025
Yes or no, you little fuck!
Get up, get up, get up!

67
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,527
- Do you know him or not?
- I don't know him.

68
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,280
Do you know him or not, you piece of shit?
I said look at him. Look.

69
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,198
Speak up, you fucking shit.

70
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:44,158
Ah, fuck this.

71
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:45,493
Look at the picture.

72
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:47,829
- Hello, sir.
- Oh, hello. Welcome.

73
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:49,580
- I'd like to ask you something.
- Okay, okay.

74
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:53,251
I'm looking for someone.
He's a friend of my dad's.

75
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:56,504
Oh, yes, I know him.

76
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:58,589
- You know this man?
- I do, but what's this about?

77
00:04:58,673 --> 00:04:59,882
Well, I'm getting married,

78
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,926
and I'd like to send him
a wedding invitation.

79
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,011
Oh.

80
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,220
Do you know where he lives?

81
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,640
Of course. After all,
I deliver rice there every month.

82
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,685
Could I get an address from you?

83
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:12,395
Oh, sure. I'll get it for you.

84
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:54,812
BLOODHOUNDS

85
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:01,819
He's here.

86
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,450
Kang In-beom's profile.

87
00:06:08,076 --> 00:06:10,620
His info right, right, right here, guys.

88
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,246
Ah.

89
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,706
You work fast.

90
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:16,376
Every second counts
in situations like this.

91
00:06:16,459 --> 00:06:18,378
- Thank you very much.
- All right.

92
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:20,171
- It's done.
- Yeah.

93
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,148
This is it?

94
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,108
Huh?

95
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:43,027
Ah, so you don't know?

96
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:47,532
Normally, when you make
someone do something like this,

97
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:52,370
- You give a little token of thanks.
- Oh, right. How much should we give you?

98
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:54,705
You know, a one piece.

99
00:06:54,789 --> 00:07:00,586
I mean, we're… we're a team and family.
A big one will do. Yeah!

100
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,838
- Okay, all right.
- Yeah.

101
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,214
Thank you.

102
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:06,300
Hey, call me whenever you need something.

103
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:08,344
- Will do. Have a nice day.
- Good night, then.

104
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,262
Mm.

105
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:22,066
Fuck, man. I meant a million won.

106
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,488
PERSONAL INFORMATION
KANG IN-BEOM

107
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,706
She told us not to use it though.

108
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:40,168
We have to look at it on a big screen
to get a better look at his neighborhood.

109
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:42,420
Right. What if Da-min comes in
while we're at it.

110
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:46,215
She won't. We got caught before
because she was passing by.

111
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,550
It was bad luck.

112
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:52,597
- "Gangdong-gu, Seonggu-ro."
- "Seonggu-ro."

113
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:00,146
I told you she'd come.
Turn it off.

114
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:01,189
Oh, God.

115
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:08,237
Uh, what are you doing?

116
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:11,824
It smells like lonely men in here.

117
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,285
Why are you using the computer again?

118
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:15,745
I told you not to.

119
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:17,455
We're sorry.

120
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:19,582
Also, sorry about the lonely man smell.

121
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:20,917
Damn.

122
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,336
Whatever. This room is ruined.

123
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:24,253
It's ruined.

124
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,213
Da-min!

125
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,966
- What is it?
- I'm also sorry about today.

126
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,635
I'll take care of this putrid smell.

127
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,345
How will you?

128
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:33,346
A diffuser.

129
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:37,642
A diffuser will get rid of
this sad old-man smell.

130
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:38,559
Really?

131
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,728
First of all, to get rid of a bad smell,

132
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:42,522
you just have to find
an opposing good scent.

133
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:45,691
This sad old-man smell is
basically a blend of a thick, musky odor

134
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,777
with slight, unintentional undertones
of rotten wood.

135
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,779
To get rid of it,
we need the opposing scent.

136
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:53,908
Something floral and fruity.

137
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:55,910
I use Baies, Baies from Diptyque.

138
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:57,828
- I like that one.
- Well, all right.

139
00:08:58,538 --> 00:08:59,539
Then we're in luck!

140
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:02,208
The fresh sweetness in the Baies
will cancel out

141
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:05,419
all the sad old-man smell here.

142
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:08,548
We'll get you one
when we leave this place.

143
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:10,591
- A gift.
- Yeah.

144
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:12,635
We'll get you one for the ground floor,
one for the top bunk.

145
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:13,761
Bathroom too.

146
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:15,304
Okay, three it is.

147
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:16,264
Deal.

148
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,776
Dude, how does Kang In-beom
know my number? He's calling now.

149
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:31,112
Whoa, no way.

150
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:32,738
Something must be wrong here, right?

151
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:42,164
Oh god.

152
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,001
What's wrong with Grandpa?

153
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:47,211
Who did this to him?

154
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:48,546
Uh…

155
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:53,134
No!

156
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:56,345
Come to Incheon's
Four Garden shopping mall in one hour.

157
00:09:57,054 --> 00:10:00,182
Call the cops, and the old man dies.

158
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:01,475
You're fucking dead.

159
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,186
Uh…

160
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,272
Uh, Da-min, you should tell us
what he said too.

161
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:08,816
He said to come to Four Garden mall
in an hour.

162
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:10,651
He said if we call the cops,

163
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:13,237
he'll kill Grandpa.

164
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,908
Come on.
There's not much time.

165
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:34,425
Gun-woo.

166
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:37,178
- How many do you think will be there?
- Uh, at least 30.

167
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:38,429
They'll probably have weapons.

168
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:41,265
and, uh, Kang In-beom and Mr. Jung
will probably be there.

169
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:44,185
Do you think it would be a good idea
to call Gang-yong?

170
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:48,773
No, that would put Mr. Oh
in too much danger.

171
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:52,318
- What about our senior?
- Which senior?

172
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:53,235
You know, Mr. Moon.

173
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:55,571
But he hurt his arm, right?

174
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,615
Wouldn't he help in any way that he could?

175
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:59,450
Uh, that's true, but…

176
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:01,952
You two ready?

177
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:05,373
Yes, but Da-min, what's the bow for?

178
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:07,041
For rescuing Grandpa.

179
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:09,752
Uh, no. There's no way.
We'll go just the two of us.

180
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,212
It's too dangerous for you.

181
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:14,382
Move over.

182
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:16,884
Da-min, why would you--

183
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:18,177
Whoa!

184
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:27,770
I also know how to fight.

185
00:11:28,896 --> 00:11:30,648
I'm coming, so don't try to stop me.

186
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,193
What are you doing? We don't have time.

187
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,821
Hey, she's a good shot.

188
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:37,738
Hey,

189
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,865
I think she'll be useful.

190
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,496
Hello, sir, it's Woo-jin.

191
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:47,623
Mr. Oh…

192
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:50,459
…has been kidnapped.

193
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:54,255
Can you, uh, help us in any way?

194
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:56,465
I'm also indebted to Mr. Oh.

195
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:59,510
Don't go in without me, no matter what.

196
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,220
That's an order.

197
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:51,312
MOON GWANG-MU
734TH CLASS SENIOR

198
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,202
My Junior Marines, you're finally here.

199
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,788
- Yes, sir.
- Wow, sir, you've really gone all out.

200
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:11,290
Oh, yeah, I had this lying around.

201
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:14,168
It really itches. I think it's pretty old.

202
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:15,920
Should probably take it off soon.

203
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,643
Through the underground parking lot,
I'll--

204
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:31,644
Wait, who are you?

205
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,646
I'm here to rescue my grandpa.

206
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,774
She's Mr. Oh's granddaughter.

207
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:39,276
Oh. Oh, right.

208
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,070
Your faces are similar. I can see it.

209
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,780
It's almost been an hour.

210
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,406
Right, right.

211
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,699
And what's in the bag?

212
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,076
It's a compound bow.

213
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:48,786
A guobaorou?

214
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:50,704
Compound bow.

215
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:51,664
Guo--

216
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:53,958
Sir, it's a competition bow.

217
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:55,459
Uh-huh.

218
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:58,003
Oh, right.
Koreans are really good at archery, yeah.

219
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,631
Is she a good shot?

220
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:01,841
She is.

221
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:06,220
All right, so Archer and I will take
the stairs from the parking lot

222
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:08,013
and make our way
to the top of the building.

223
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:11,058
Our two Marines,
you charge in through the front gates.

224
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:13,435
We'll cover fire from the top. Understood?

225
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:14,812
- Yes, sir.
- Let's move.

226
00:14:15,896 --> 00:14:16,856
Go.

227
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:17,940
- Follow me.
- Okay.

228
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,489
- This way.
- Right, okay.

229
00:14:58,647 --> 00:14:59,857
Where is Mr. Oh?

230
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,776
Kill them!

231
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,834
One, two, three!

232
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,701
Wow.

233
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:53,911
- Good job.
- Get them.

234
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:55,496
Where? Who is it?

235
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:00,918
What is it?
Where is it coming from?

236
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:04,254
Hey, hey!

237
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,506
Up there!

238
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:07,091
Get the black one. The black one.

239
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:08,509
Who is it? Who's doing this?

240
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:19,269
The blue one there. There, the guy there.

241
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:24,775
Damn it.

242
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:26,860
You keep helping out the juniors, okay?

243
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:28,862
Oh, fuck. Fuck!

244
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:36,453
Hey there, blue boy.

245
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,498
Are you on the track team or something?

246
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,250
Fucking shit!

247
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:05,232
Get lost!

248
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,554
What are you doing? Get up.

249
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,310
Shit.

250
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:05,519
Shit!

251
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,536
Guess you need a knife to beat me,
huh, tough guy?

252
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:24,913
Then pull it out, asshole.

253
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:26,957
Come on.

254
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,839
You've got pride, after all.

255
00:19:35,716 --> 00:19:36,550
Let's go.

256
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,927
Oh, hey, are you…

257
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:20,844
…are you all right?

258
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:22,012
Not really.

259
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,804
One, two, three, four!

260
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:06,640
One, two, three, four!

261
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:31,206
All right. Track guy.

262
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:34,334
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, asshole. Wake up!

263
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:36,086
Come on. Up, up, up!

264
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:37,212
Up!

265
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,630
So where's Mr. Oh?

266
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:41,466
Look at this asshole.

267
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,468
Does he think he's being a tough guy
or something?

268
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,721
- Hey, Archer, give me an arrow quick!
- Huh?

269
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,056
I'll give it back.
I just need it for a second.

270
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:52,185
All right, let's see
what a loyal bloodhound this guy is.

271
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,146
I was like you, you know?

272
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:56,315
Well, back when Mr. Choi was alive.

273
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:01,945
But do you know what becomes
of a bloodhound that's lost its master?!

274
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:05,824
It becomes a filthy stray
that mauls everyone in sight.

275
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:06,950
Oh!

276
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:13,749
Oh, no. No!

277
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,752
This isn't pain that you're feeling.
It's just shock.

278
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,462
The real pain comes

279
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:22,215
when I pull this bad boy out!

280
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:29,306
Hey guys, could you…
please cover Archer's ears for a second?

281
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,021
You married, shithead?

282
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:42,652
Because the important thing
in the whole world is family.

283
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:46,490
But without this, buddy,
you'll never be able to make one.

284
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:50,118
So, work or family?

285
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,120
You better choose wisely.

286
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:56,166
I gotta admit, you choose work right now,

287
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:57,959
that's gonna make you a real pro.

288
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:01,463
But obviously, in that case,
I'm gonna have to puncture your balls.

289
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:05,050
"Why?" you ask. Because I'm also a pro.

290
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,135
All right.

291
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,013
You got three.

292
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,223
Three,

293
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:12,265
two,

294
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,018
one.

295
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:19,356
- Wait!
- What? Why, why, why?

296
00:23:21,191 --> 00:23:22,109
I'll talk, yeah.

297
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,323
Tuck down, asshole.

298
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:30,659
Get inside, hurry!

299
00:23:31,993 --> 00:23:34,162
I said fuckin' tuck down.

300
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:41,211
Uh, sir, we'll go
and save Mr. Oh right away.

301
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:43,130
Can you hold on to Kang In-beom
in the meantime?

302
00:23:43,213 --> 00:23:45,215
What are you talking about?
I'm coming with you guys.

303
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:46,716
We're gonna do it ourselves.

304
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,594
Your arm's in bad shape, sir.

305
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:52,055
Fuck me.

306
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:55,642
Uh, sir, Kang In-beom knows
where Kim Myeong-gil's slush funds are,

307
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:58,478
plus the location
of the safe containing those funds

308
00:23:58,562 --> 00:23:59,604
and Mr. Choi's gold.

309
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:03,442
Please get all that information out of him
using your Marine tactics.

310
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:04,609
We need you, sir. Please.

311
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:06,361
All right.

312
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:07,737
You got it.

313
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:10,866
You just get him back, okay?

314
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,367
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

315
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:14,202
Let's go. Da-min.

316
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,880
NATIONAL POLICE AGENCY

317
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:30,802
Here.

318
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,139
What do you think?

319
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:38,727
Sir, I've seen him this prick
standing next to the chief of staff.

320
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,979
The chief of staff?

321
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:43,857
Yes, sir. The hooked nose and those ears.
I'm positive.

322
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:47,486
Why would a scummy loan shark bribe
the presidential office?

323
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:48,778
I bet he sticks his nose everywhere.

324
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:51,907
Or he could be a bigger player
than we actually realize.

325
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:56,953
HEAVY DRINKER GUN-WOO

326
00:24:58,288 --> 00:24:59,122
What's up?

327
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:01,333
Hey, man, sorry for calling you
at such a late hour,

328
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:03,960
but we didn't know what to do
in this situation, so we had to reach out.

329
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:07,214
- What?
- Kim Myeong-gil, he kidnapped Mr. Oh.

330
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:09,257
So I'm heading to Seoryeong
with Woo-jin right now.

331
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,509
Just the two of you?

332
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:12,385
Why the hell
are you only telling me this now?

333
00:25:12,469 --> 00:25:13,303
I'm sorry,

334
00:25:13,386 --> 00:25:16,556
but they told us that they'd kill Mr. Oh
if we said anything to the cops.

335
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,641
Hold on.

336
00:25:18,558 --> 00:25:20,352
Did Kim Myeong-gil call you himself?

337
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:22,229
No, no. We managed to capture
one of his thugs.

338
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:23,480
He's the one who told us.

339
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:26,066
So, you don't know for sure
if Kim Myeong-gil will be there?

340
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:26,983
No.

341
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:30,737
Send me the location. I'll head over now.

342
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,322
Don't go in. Just wait for me, okay?

343
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:33,281
Okay.

344
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:36,451
- Dude, text him the info.
- Okay.

345
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:41,790
Sir.

346
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:44,417
Jae-min,
come down to the meeting room right now.

347
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:46,002
All right, sir.

348
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:57,597
Hey, listen here. Call in some backup.
It's Buseong-myeon in Seoryeong.

349
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:59,724
It's about that thing
I mentioned last time.

350
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,560
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

351
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:03,270
When did you see them?

352
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,438
About a month ago.

353
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:07,857
LIEUTENANT KIM JAE-MIN

354
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,194
Mm.

355
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,749
MR. KIM MYEONG-GIL

356
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,712
The cops are on their way.

357
00:26:28,795 --> 00:26:29,838
Okay, got it.

358
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:40,724
Yo, the cops are comin'. Clean up!

359
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,290
All right.
Check if there's a back entrance.

360
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:07,584
- Come on, quick. Quick, move out.
- Hurry up.

361
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:20,472
Turn off the engine.

362
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:21,389
Sorry.

363
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:24,392
Hey, we'll see what's going on inside.
Wait here.

364
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:30,065
We just searched the place.
There's nothing here but a flatfish farm.

365
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:31,608
Oh…

366
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:34,861
Maybe this guy will know something.

367
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:40,367
Who the hell is this asshole?

368
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:41,993
Kim Myeong-gil's thug.

369
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:44,037
The one who stabbed me.

370
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:50,335
I'm a cop, and I've got some questions
you need to answer.

371
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:53,713
You prick, nod your head.

372
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:56,675
Is Seoul Fish Farm the right place?

373
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:00,679
Did anyone know that we were coming?

374
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:05,975
Gang-yong.

375
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:09,020
This guy's crew gave us the slip
in the middle of the fight.

376
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:11,564
They might've given them a heads-up
before we got here.

377
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:18,780
Let this guy out and leave now.

378
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:20,323
You guys weren't here. Is that clear?

379
00:28:20,407 --> 00:28:21,449
- Okay.
- Okay.

380
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:22,992
- Are you hurt?
- No.

381
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:24,828
Han-gu.

382
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:36,673
Where is Grandpa?

383
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:39,259
We need to wait a little more.

384
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:40,844
The detectives should get back to us.

385
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:43,430
We don't have much time.

386
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,393
We have to find him.

387
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:51,396
No matter what it takes.

388
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,441
The safe! Where's the safe?

389
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:57,694
Come on, you fuckhead.
Where's Kim Myeong-gil's safe?

390
00:28:57,777 --> 00:28:59,154
Damn it! Come on!

391
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:03,032
Listen, asshole, if you keep this up,
you're gonna end up dead, you hear me?

392
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:18,590
Okay, give me a cigarette.

393
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:21,551
You piece of shit!

394
00:29:26,306 --> 00:29:28,183
- Hit me!
- Fuck him!

395
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:30,435
Hit me harder!

396
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:37,066
BEST PORK
BEOMSEUNG DISTRIBUTION

397
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:47,744
How'd it go?

398
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:49,704
Why isn't Mr. Oh with you?

399
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:50,955
Uh, we couldn't find him.

400
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,208
I think his thugs caught on to us
and took him somewhere else.

401
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:54,667
Damn it.

402
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:55,794
That gym rat say anything?

403
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:57,754
That's one stubborn fucker in there.

404
00:29:57,837 --> 00:29:59,088
He won't say a word.

405
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:06,054
Having fun, huh?

406
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:11,267
- You want fun? I'll show you fun.
- What the hell are you gonna do now?

407
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:24,572
Shit!

408
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:27,575
Sir! That idiot, he bit his tongue.

409
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:29,828
- Fuck!
- Come on, sir!

410
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,331
Goddammit! Fuck!

411
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:35,542
- Hey! Hey!
- Fuck.

412
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:37,752
- Hey, Kang In-beom, snap out of it! Hey!
- Damn it!

413
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:40,755
- Dude, call an ambulance now.
- Okay.

414
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:42,340
Uh, wait! Wait, wait!

415
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:45,593
If we just send him off,
how will we find Kim Myeong-gil's safe?

416
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:48,221
Still, we can't just stand here
and let a person die, sir.

417
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:51,474
If he dies like this,
we still won't be able to get to the safe.

418
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:53,893
Okay, give it to me quick.

419
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:56,020
- You gotta let me get him down.
- Fuck!

420
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:56,980
Okay. Come on.

421
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,405
Sir! Sir, are you all right?

422
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:08,324
Sir, wake up! Are you okay?

423
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:15,874
Hello.

424
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:18,710
- Hello.
- Where's the owner?

425
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:20,670
Oh, yes, she went on vacation.

426
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:22,088
Oh.

427
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:24,966
I'd like an iced hand-drip coffee
with Ethiopian beans.

428
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:25,884
All right.

429
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:29,929
- Here you go. It'll be right out.
- All right. Thank you.

430
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:32,891
MY HAPPY FAMILY, I'LL KEEP YOU SAFE

431
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:51,451
CEO KIM MYEONG-GIL
ATTACHED FILE: 1 VIDEO FILE

432
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,249
Oh shit!

433
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:05,340
Hey, Min-beom.

434
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:08,551
Kim Myeong-gil still has the video of me.

435
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:10,762
He just sent it to me.

436
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:12,096
Uh, but how?

437
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:16,976
Hello?

438
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,227
- Gang-yong?
-

439
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,229
- Hello?

440
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:27,111
Damn it!

441
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:34,702
Fuck.

442
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:15,451
Motherfucker.

443
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:21,499
Salt.

444
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:22,583
What?

445
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,085
Salt!

446
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:50,611
Someone's been hit by a car!

447
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,196
What happened?

448
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,699
Oh my God! I think someone died.

449
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:59,245
MR. OH

450
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:04,375
Gun-woo, hurry. Look.

451
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:14,469
Hey, shitheads.

452
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:16,971
Why make a big problem out of nothing?

453
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:19,807
What do you want from us?

454
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:24,520
Come to the fish farm today at 9:00 p.m.

455
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:26,981
If you decide to call the cops again,

456
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:29,984
I'll grind up the old man
and feed him to the fish.

457
00:34:30,693 --> 00:34:31,903
You got it?

458
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:35,990
I've gotten rid of Min Gang-yong
and all his cronies,

459
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,575
so there's no one else to help you.

460
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,452
Oh, and one more thing,

461
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:41,662
if you mess around, your mom's next.

462
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,748
See you there.

463
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:48,878
GANG-YONG

464
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:56,928
How'd he get to Gang-yong? He's a cop.

465
00:34:57,762 --> 00:34:59,597
Dude, I think things
might get really dangerous.

466
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,140
We should really go alone this time.

467
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:02,767
Excuse me?

468
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:06,604
How long have you been there?

469
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:08,106
The whole time.

470
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:12,568
Don't even try to leave me out.
I'm going to rescue Grandpa.

471
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:19,534
Come with me.

472
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:30,837
Listen, Woo-jin,

473
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:34,048
if something bad were to happen
to Mr. Oh right in front of us,

474
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:37,885
Da-min's definitely going to
break down like Hyeon-ju did and I…

475
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,848
I never want to see
something like that happen again.

476
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:43,474
But Gun-woo,

477
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:46,602
one thing that's different from back then.

478
00:35:47,228 --> 00:35:48,354
You know what that is?

479
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:50,231
Back then,

480
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:53,693
the invincible Marine duo were apart.

481
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:56,028
That's not the case now.

482
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:59,031
And we're stronger. A lot strong.
You remember, right?

483
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,868
One, two, three, four, five.

484
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:03,661
One, two, three, four, five!

485
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:08,666
Look,

486
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:12,587
let's work together,
so we can save everyone.

487
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:15,131
Mr. Oh, Da-min,

488
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,426
the people that Kim Myeong-gil hurt.

489
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:24,348
Ack?

490
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:25,516
Ack!

491
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:28,060
Ack!

492
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:30,313
Ack!

493
00:36:41,073 --> 00:36:42,158
Why'd we stop?

494
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,410
Woo-jin and I are gonna head in first.

495
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:46,495
Keep a look
until you find a good spot to shoot from.

496
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:47,538
That's when you move in.

497
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:48,581
Sounds good.

498
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:50,458
You should get out.

499
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:16,359
They could've dropped me off closer.

500
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:21,822
- Good thinking.
- Hm?

501
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:26,035
Dropping Da-min off far away
so that she doesn't get hurt.

502
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:29,914
Uh, I just didn't want her
to end up getting caught.

503
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:32,708
Was it too far?

504
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:36,337
It'll take her ten minutes.

505
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,214
Then let's get this over with fast.

506
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:39,632
Okay.

507
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:48,868
Kill them!

508
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:53,622
Get 'em.

509
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:55,207
These guys have a shit ton of weapons.

510
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,674
Dude!

511
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:46,300
Son of a bitch!

512
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,378
I'm gonna fuck you up, man!

513
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:23,379
Oh shit.

514
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:29,093
Hey.

515
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:32,179
You can't even get rid of two kids?

516
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,307
I'm sorry, sir.

517
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:37,226
Sorry isn't fucking good enough.

518
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:42,565
Now then.

519
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:45,651
Come on!

520
00:40:47,069 --> 00:40:47,903
Now,

521
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:52,324
you punks come any closer,
and I'll slit the old timer's throat.

522
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:53,367
You understand me?

523
00:40:54,076 --> 00:40:56,287
Too bad. I wanted to do it.

524
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:07,756
Hurry up and kill them, you stupid fucks!
What are you waiting for?

525
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:10,259
Do I have to kill them? Huh?

526
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:12,678
You sons of bitches are just unbelievable.

527
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,101
Hey, duck!

528
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,653
You fuckin' son of a bitch!

529
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:32,114
Come here, you fucker! Come here!

530
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:34,116
I told you to hurry up
and kill them, you assholes!

531
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:35,993
What are you doing? Let go, motherfucker!

532
00:41:43,751 --> 00:41:45,544
I said let go of me!

533
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,882
Kill them! Come on!

534
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:15,241
Grandpa!

535
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:17,034
Grandpa, are you okay?

536
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:19,578
It's me, Da-min.

537
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:24,917
Oh.

538
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:29,171
You pulled out my eyebrows.

539
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,259
Mr. Oh, are you all right?

540
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:36,887
Thank you.

541
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:48,315
Hurry up.

542
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:52,069
- What's this?
- All right. All right, come on.

543
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:54,071
Come on, get on it.
Hurry up and untie them.

544
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:02,371
Who is it?

545
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:04,164
Delivery.

546
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,050
Ah, what the fuck.

547
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:17,886
Stay still, you fucking asshole!

548
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:22,600
Do a full sweep,
including the interior!

549
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,893
- Scour every inch!
- What is this place?

550
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:29,690
I found it! Everyone over here!

551
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:30,941
Oh, God.

552
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:34,653
What the hell? These guys are psychopaths.
What were they doing here?

553
00:43:38,824 --> 00:43:41,243
Ma'am, we from
the Serious Crime Investigation Division.

554
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:43,245
I have a search warrant.

555
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:46,415
As of right now, your property
will be subjected to search and seizure

556
00:43:46,498 --> 00:43:47,833
We'd appreciate your cooperation.

557
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:48,751
Let's go.

558
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:50,544
Come on. Hurry up.

559
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:56,925
Mr. Kim Jae-min?

560
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:00,054
You're under arrest
for murder, bribery, kidnapping.

561
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:03,932
Fuck me. This is so fucked up, man.

562
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,434
Let's go.

563
00:44:07,227 --> 00:44:09,438
- Sir, check it out.
- Wow.

564
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:19,448
NATIONAL POLICE HOSPITAL

565
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:22,076
Luckily we got the warrant quickly
and went into Kim Myeong-gil's house.

566
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:24,328
A bunch of cell phones were found
in his closet.

567
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:26,705
We traced the numbers.

568
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:28,832
And they all belonged
to dead or missing individuals.

569
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:31,126
This crazy asshole.

570
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:34,421
He was storing the phones
that belonged to the people he killed.

571
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:36,548
He can't escape this.

572
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:38,676
Not even the American president
can help him.

573
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:40,094
Could go overseas.

574
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:42,930
He's a wanted man now. It won't be easy.

575
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:46,141
Criminals frequently go to China
on cargo ships, don't they?

576
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:48,394
Kim Myeong-gil is
a grade-A wanted criminal.

577
00:44:48,477 --> 00:44:50,688
We'll be focusing surveillance
on potential stowaway routes.

578
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:52,564
He won't get out of Korea that easily.

579
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:54,566
But it's not completely off the table.

580
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:59,530
You all seem to think this is all over,
but I'm really on edge right now.

581
00:44:59,613 --> 00:45:01,573
That bastard still has that video of me.

582
00:45:01,657 --> 00:45:03,909
If he releases it at any time,
it's all over for me.

583
00:45:09,331 --> 00:45:10,249
Brother.

584
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:13,585
I really have to see
that maniac behind bars.

585
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:15,587
Min-beom.

586
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:19,717
I understand.

587
00:45:23,178 --> 00:45:25,013
But just look at Han-gu's condition.

588
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,808
And Tae-yeong is still in a coma.

589
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:30,102
We just need some time.

590
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:39,403
We're gonna help find him.

591
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:42,656
It's not over till it's over for real.

592
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:47,286
Um, is there any way you could find out
where Im Jang-do might be?

593
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:48,912
Why do you need Im Jang-do?

594
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:52,958
Im Jang-do's probably in hiding somewhere
trying to stay away from Kim Myeong-gil.

595
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:57,463
I think maybe Im Jang-do may know
where Kim Myeong-gil might run off to.

596
00:45:57,546 --> 00:45:59,757
That's right.
Im Jang-do may have given him tips

597
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,550
on how to smuggle himself
out of the country.

598
00:46:01,633 --> 00:46:03,886
He mentioned earlier
he was in charge of stuff like that.

599
00:46:04,803 --> 00:46:06,638
All right, I'll look into it.

600
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:17,441
- All right, how much in cash?
- I think I can give you 18 million.

601
00:46:18,776 --> 00:46:21,987
Im Jang-do hasn't used
a phone or credit card under his name

602
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:23,280
in the last six months.

603
00:46:24,364 --> 00:46:27,075
He's avoided anything
that might give us a lead.

604
00:46:27,159 --> 00:46:28,786
So we don't have anything?

605
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:34,082
Well, so far all we've found
is his bank account number.

606
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:37,920
And apparently, he did a cash withdrawal
last March in Suwon.

607
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:39,505
Can't you follow that?

608
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:43,050
We could, but we'll have to check
a few months' worth of security footage,

609
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:45,302
which would take some time.

610
00:46:46,386 --> 00:46:48,764
Do you think
we could get his account number?

611
00:46:48,847 --> 00:46:49,765
IM JANG-DO
JOHAN BANK

612
00:46:49,848 --> 00:46:52,142
This prick is super strapped for cash,

613
00:46:52,226 --> 00:46:54,937
so wire some money into that account,
and when you send it,

614
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:57,397
put down your phone number
under the sender's name.

615
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,233
Then he'll contact you
straight away for sure.

616
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:01,819
- How much should we send him?
- A big one should do.

617
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:03,278
Ten thousand won?

618
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:06,949
I was wondering
if I should mention this last time,

619
00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:09,910
but in this line of work,
"a big one" differs by the situation.

620
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:12,538
That big one
from when I got you Kang In-beom's info,

621
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:14,748
that was supposed to be a million won.

622
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:15,958
A million won?

623
00:47:16,041 --> 00:47:19,127
It's cool. It's cool.
I'm not asking for that money now, okay?

624
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:20,629
I'm not some greedy asshole.

625
00:47:20,712 --> 00:47:21,964
We're family, after all.

626
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:24,591
Okay, in this case,
how much are we talking about?

627
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:26,468
He'll laugh at a million won.

628
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:27,845
Ten million.

629
00:47:29,429 --> 00:47:30,806
He'll bite right away.

630
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:43,735
Your wounds aren't healing
because you keep drinking alcohol--

631
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:57,583
- Doctor.
- Yes, sir.

632
00:47:58,166 --> 00:48:00,419
- Do your job.
- Yes, sir.

633
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:07,009
Shit.

634
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:08,260
Sixty-six,

635
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:10,095
sixty-seven,

636
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:12,180
sixty-eight, sixty-nine.

637
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:13,724
Dude, someone's calling.

638
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:15,976
There's no number.

639
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:23,275
Hello?

640
00:48:28,113 --> 00:48:28,947
Hello?

641
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:33,201
Hello?

642
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:35,871
You.

643
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:38,540
The kid that was with Mr. Choi, right?

644
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:43,003
Yes.

645
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:45,923
And the cops told you my account number.

646
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:48,634
Why?

647
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:50,719
Why did you send the money?

648
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:53,388
Because Kim Myeong-gil is running away.

649
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:55,057
Why?

650
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:57,225
Police have raided his house

651
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:59,853
and found substantial evidence
that he killed several people.

652
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:02,230
- When was that?
- Two days ago.

653
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:05,984
You know where
Kim Myeong-gil will run to, don't you?

654
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:09,655
I do.

655
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:11,490
Listen.

656
00:49:11,573 --> 00:49:14,701
We have to catch him.
Please help us find out where he is.

657
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:19,247
How much will you pay?

658
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:23,335
Uh, a big one.

659
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:26,421
You've got to be fucking kidding me.

660
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:30,175
- I want a billion.
- A billion?

661
00:49:30,258 --> 00:49:32,803
I trusted President Choi
and got royally fucked over.

662
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:34,513
I deserve at least a billion.

663
00:49:34,596 --> 00:49:36,181
Okay, but we don't have--

664
00:49:36,264 --> 00:49:38,266
Within a few days,
Kim Myeong-gil will flee overseas

665
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:40,102
using the method I taught him.

666
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:43,146
You know my account, right?

667
00:49:44,189 --> 00:49:45,107
Think it over.

668
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:50,112
That it so fucked.

669
00:49:50,988 --> 00:49:52,364
How will we ever get a billion won?

670
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:55,534
Should we ask Mr. Oh
if he could do anything?

671
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:57,160
Mr. Oh doesn't have money.

672
00:49:57,744 --> 00:50:00,330
The money he gave us back then
was all he had left.

673
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:01,707
Hold up.

674
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:08,755
How much do we have in there?

675
00:50:11,883 --> 00:50:13,385
I think around 300 million.

676
00:50:13,468 --> 00:50:14,761
It's nowhere enough.

677
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:19,975
Should we ask Min-beom
if we could borrow some money?

678
00:50:20,058 --> 00:50:22,394
Im Jang-do's the one
who took that video of Min-beom.

679
00:50:23,478 --> 00:50:25,772
You think he'll help us with this?

680
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:27,566
I don't know.

681
00:50:28,316 --> 00:50:31,153
But I think Min-beom's the only one
who could help us in this situation.

682
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:33,947
Let's try asking him just once, mm?

683
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:43,874
Sir, here they are.

684
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:51,465
Do you guys trust Im Jang-do?

685
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:54,468
Uh,

686
00:50:55,635 --> 00:51:00,182
we do think that he can help us find…
everything that we've been looking for.

687
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:03,560
What if he pockets the money
and goes overseas?

688
00:51:04,227 --> 00:51:05,312
Then what do we do?

689
00:51:25,415 --> 00:51:26,249
If he does that,

690
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:30,796
if Im Jang-do breaks his promise and runs,
we'll chase him down and catch him.

691
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:33,799
This much I can promise, sir.
You have my word.

692
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:50,398
Keep that promise.

693
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:53,443
- Great.
- Great.

694
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:58,740
1,000,000,000 RECEIVED

695
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:14,756
- Okay, looks good. Move along.
- Okay.

696
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:16,341
You can go.

697
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:11,938
UNKNOWN CALLER

698
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:15,859
Write this down.

699
00:53:15,942 --> 00:53:17,611
The day after tomorrow at 1:00 a.m.,

700
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:21,198
a cargo ship called the Nike
is going to depart for Ho Chi Minh City.

701
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:24,743
Kim Myeong-gil gave political donations
to a high-ranking Vietnamese official.

702
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:27,454
He's going to take off
with all of his slush funds.

703
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:30,957
The container number is 9004230.

704
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:34,169
There will be a cargo truck
with all of his slush funds hidden inside.

705
00:53:34,252 --> 00:53:36,546
Should we move in
when Kim Myeong-gil's getting on the ship?

706
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:38,548
It won't be easy to find
because it's a big ship.

707
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:39,466
How will we find it?

708
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,843
You guys get on the ship with him.

709
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:46,514
You mean we should get on the ship
and go to Vietnam?

710
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:48,141
Well, that's up to you, right?

711
00:53:48,642 --> 00:53:50,435
- Bye.
- Wait, wait, wait.

712
00:53:50,518 --> 00:53:53,146
What should we do then
if we decide to board that ship?

713
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:55,523
I'll text you a contact of mine.

714
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:57,442
Tell him I sent you
and try to work out a deal.

715
00:53:57,525 --> 00:53:59,736
Also, he really likes cash.

716
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:07,160
That's the text.

717
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:19,130
I didn't know what you'd need,
so I brought a little bit of everything.

718
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:21,424
Thank you, sir.

719
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:22,759
You two take care.

720
00:54:23,635 --> 00:54:24,594
Yes, sir.

721
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:26,721
Okay?

722
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:28,807
Yes.

723
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:32,102
Let's go up.

724
00:54:33,144 --> 00:54:34,062
You go on ahead.

725
00:54:34,854 --> 00:54:35,772
I need a minute.

726
00:54:38,858 --> 00:54:39,859
Okay.

727
00:54:45,657 --> 00:54:47,409
Thank you so much for your help.

728
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:49,911
No, we should be thanking you.

729
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:01,464
Da-min, see you soon.

730
00:55:03,174 --> 00:55:04,759
- See you.
- Up you go.

731
00:55:08,388 --> 00:55:09,264
Oh.

732
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:12,017
You have my number?

733
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:13,810
Mm.

734
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:21,568
Let's go.

735
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:34,497
- Hello.
- Hey, you're on your way there?

736
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:36,458
Yes, we're on our way.

737
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:39,085
Don't get hurt, okay?

738
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:40,420
Okay.

739
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:42,756
Me and Gang-yong
will take care of the rest.

740
00:55:43,631 --> 00:55:44,758
Drive safe.

741
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:45,675
Yeah.

742
00:56:20,293 --> 00:56:21,586
Let's hurry along then.

743
00:56:21,669 --> 00:56:24,381
- Just a second.
- We'll be right back.

744
00:56:37,018 --> 00:56:37,852
Dude.

745
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:42,190
Okay.

746
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:56,621
Set sail.

747
00:57:07,507 --> 00:57:09,843
- Okay, go check out the inside first.
- Got it.

748
00:57:52,051 --> 00:57:53,136
Kim Myeong-gil!

749
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:25,585
Uh-huh.

750
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:26,503
Uh-huh.

751
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:35,345
Oh!

752
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,108
If you ever show your face again…

753
01:03:01,944 --> 01:03:03,029
I'll kill you.

754
01:03:48,449 --> 01:03:49,283
Gun-woo.

755
01:03:53,704 --> 01:03:54,622
Are you all right?

756
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:07,677
What is it?

757
01:04:10,888 --> 01:04:11,722
Dude.

758
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:17,103
I've become a bloodhound.

759
01:04:35,037 --> 01:04:38,249
Gun-woo, have you forgotten
about the heart of a boxer?

760
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:41,878
All we have to do is find our way back.

761
01:04:42,670 --> 01:04:43,504
Hm?

762
01:04:44,088 --> 01:04:45,423
Let's go back together.

763
01:04:51,137 --> 01:04:51,971
Mm-hm.

764
01:04:52,972 --> 01:04:53,890
Let's go back.

765
01:05:02,815 --> 01:05:03,649
Here.

766
01:05:22,543 --> 01:05:23,711
Whoa! Dude!

767
01:05:27,548 --> 01:05:30,343
Ah, yes!

768
01:05:38,768 --> 01:05:39,602
Hey.

769
01:05:39,685 --> 01:05:42,229
- Hey, man, where are you?
- I'm almost there.

770
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:44,482
Gold bars, did you find them?

771
01:05:45,066 --> 01:05:46,651
Yes, we found them all.

772
01:05:47,818 --> 01:05:48,653
And the phone?

773
01:05:50,363 --> 01:05:51,489
I'll go get it.

774
01:05:51,572 --> 01:05:54,492
- Oh, dude, here. Here.
- Oh, oh, oh! Let's go!

775
01:05:54,575 --> 01:05:55,409
Right!

776
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:05,252
How'd it go?

777
01:06:05,336 --> 01:06:07,213
I finally got the phone.

778
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:11,258
They did good.

779
01:06:12,009 --> 01:06:14,929
I asked Interpol for backup.
They'll be waiting in Vietnam.

780
01:06:16,013 --> 01:06:17,181
It's all over.

781
01:06:17,264 --> 01:06:19,350
You really went through a lot, kiddo.

782
01:06:19,433 --> 01:06:20,393
Thank you.

783
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:38,077
What would you guys like to do with this?

784
01:06:40,204 --> 01:06:41,163
Hm.

785
01:06:42,623 --> 01:06:46,752
Well, Mr. Choi always wanted to help
those who were too poor

786
01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:48,462
to get proper medical treatment,

787
01:06:49,755 --> 01:06:53,592
so I'd like this money to be spent
in accordance with Mr. Choi's wishes.

788
01:06:54,552 --> 01:06:55,886
What do you think about that idea?

789
01:06:57,388 --> 01:06:59,306
Don't you want the money for yourself?

790
01:07:03,102 --> 01:07:05,229
Uh, of course, I do.

791
01:07:06,063 --> 01:07:07,940
But this isn't my money.

792
01:07:08,941 --> 01:07:09,775
To be fair,

793
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:12,194
I'm just trying to pay back Mr. Choi
for his kindness

794
01:07:12,278 --> 01:07:14,196
and make I sure I keep the promise
I made to him.

795
01:07:16,157 --> 01:07:17,158
Mm.

796
01:07:17,742 --> 01:07:19,035
Guys.

797
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:23,205
We have a total of 168 golden bars,

798
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:25,791
and each one would give us 500 million,

799
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:27,835
putting us at 84 billion in total.

800
01:07:27,918 --> 01:07:30,421
If you want, I'll take this

801
01:07:30,504 --> 01:07:33,799
and start a welfare foundation
all under Iil Group.

802
01:07:33,883 --> 01:07:35,301
Through that welfare foundation,

803
01:07:35,384 --> 01:07:38,304
we'll be able to provide
medical assistance to people who need it.

804
01:07:39,263 --> 01:07:40,097
On top of that,

805
01:07:40,181 --> 01:07:42,308
I should just have our company
add some money to the pot,

806
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:44,685
set up a hospital while we're at it.

807
01:07:45,227 --> 01:07:47,313
- Well, that sounds like a great idea.
- Right?

808
01:07:47,396 --> 01:07:48,397
It does.

809
01:07:48,481 --> 01:07:50,357
I think my dad will like it too.

810
01:07:50,983 --> 01:07:53,235
And it'll help
with our company image as well.

811
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:55,196
Besides, we'll do the world a lot of good.

812
01:07:56,238 --> 01:07:58,449
I'll get started
as soon as I'm done with the hotel.

813
01:07:58,532 --> 01:07:59,366
One last thing.

814
01:08:00,659 --> 01:08:03,329
Could you maybe include Mr. Choi
in the hospital name?

815
01:08:03,954 --> 01:08:06,499
- What was his name?
- His full name was Choi Tae-ho.

816
01:08:07,041 --> 01:08:09,835
To be honest,
I don't think it'll be that easy,

817
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:12,379
but I'll definitely consider it.

818
01:08:12,463 --> 01:08:13,631
Thank you so much.

819
01:08:21,263 --> 01:08:22,473
Huh?

820
01:08:22,556 --> 01:08:24,934
I'll cover the missing amount
with my own money.

821
01:08:25,017 --> 01:08:27,186
Think of it as a bonus
for a job well done.

822
01:08:27,686 --> 01:08:28,604
Um, it's all right.

823
01:08:28,687 --> 01:08:29,855
We're really good.

824
01:08:30,356 --> 01:08:32,441
That Mr. Choi would have done the same.

825
01:08:33,067 --> 01:08:33,901
Take it.

826
01:08:38,906 --> 01:08:41,283
What, you don't know
what to say all of a sudden?

827
01:08:44,245 --> 01:08:45,579
A thank you would do.

828
01:08:46,997 --> 01:08:49,208
- Thank you so much, Mr. Choi.
- No.

829
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:52,837
I'm the one that should be thanking you.

830
01:08:56,215 --> 01:08:57,299
Thank you so much!

831
01:09:07,184 --> 01:09:09,979
Let's get the ball.
Come on. Stop her!

832
01:09:12,189 --> 01:09:14,608
There, right?

833
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:19,155
Oh!

834
01:09:20,114 --> 01:09:21,323
Gun-woo, is that you?

835
01:09:22,199 --> 01:09:23,367
What? Where are you?

836
01:09:25,703 --> 01:09:27,371
Gun-woo!

837
01:09:27,872 --> 01:09:29,290
Oh! Oh!

838
01:09:34,795 --> 01:09:35,671
Oh!

839
01:09:40,885 --> 01:09:41,886
Oh, my son.

840
01:09:41,969 --> 01:09:43,470
Ah!

841
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:46,515
Oh!

842
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:48,976
Woo-jin.

843
01:09:49,852 --> 01:09:53,063
Oh my gosh, look at you.
What happened to your face?

844
01:09:53,647 --> 01:09:55,608
God, you went through so much.

845
01:09:59,486 --> 01:10:01,488
It's all over, Mom. Let's go home now.

846
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:03,032
All right. Okay.

847
01:10:04,533 --> 01:10:06,702
Oh God, I'm so proud of you!

848
01:10:06,785 --> 01:10:08,746
Ah!
