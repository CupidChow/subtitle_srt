00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:13,179
DECEMBER 2020

2
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:16,933
JINNAM BOXING

3
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:28,463
Oh, uh, sir.

4
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:31,257
You need to wear a mask on the bus, sir.

5
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:33,635
You can't ride the bus
without a mask. I'm sorry.

6
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:34,594
Let's go.

7
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:36,638
You'll be allowed on
when you return with a mask.

8
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:38,473
Who are you to tell me what to do?

9
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:40,934
- We get penalized--
- What? A mask?

10
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:44,229
- It's my choice!
- Please leave, sir.

11
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:47,190
You're a driver,
so drive the damn bus.

12
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:48,274
I'm telling you.

13
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:51,528
- Please put on a mask and come back, sir.
- You're just a driver. Come here!

14
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,280
- There are passengers on board.
- Please don't do this.

15
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,574
- What the hell is this? Whoa!
- Whoa!

16
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,785
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Get off of me.

17
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:01,037
What? Who the hell are you?

18
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:03,623
I'm sorry, I think
you'll have to walk home. Sorry.

19
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:05,208
I'm sorry.

20
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,335
You shi--

21
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:09,212
Sorry, sir.

22
00:02:09,295 --> 00:02:11,214
I'm very sorry.

23
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:12,590
Whoa, I'm sorry.

24
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:14,467
I hope you're not hurt. Sorry, sir.

25
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:19,264
Goddamn you little--

26
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:20,849
I'm very sorry.

27
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,226
Bullshit.

28
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:26,938
- I'm really sorry.
- My ass.

29
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:33,027
Sorry about that. Thank you.

30
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:34,863
- Thank you, sir.
- No problem.

31
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:40,076
See,
the passengers are grateful too.

32
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:01,222
The guy in the mask kept saying…

33
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:23,661
I'm so sorry.

34
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:27,707
God, I had no idea it would go on
for this long.

35
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:31,169
I am so sorry that I have to ask you.

36
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:32,086
I'm sorry.

37
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,756
I'll try to put something together
next month. I promise.

38
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,928
So, do you think can you wait
just one more month?

39
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:42,972
I… I promise I'll pay you back.

40
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:46,726
Yes, yes. Next month. I'll try my best.

41
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,645
Yes, thank you.

42
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:30,895
BLOODHOUNDS

43
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:35,900
Amidst the ongoing recession
brought on by COVID-19…

44
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:37,986
CITIZENS TREMBLE WITH ANXIETY
ABOUT ABANDONED BUILDINGS IN THE CITY

45
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:41,072
…a suspended building construction project
is threatening the safety of the citizens.

46
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:42,115
NO TRESPASSING

47
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:44,659
Construction on the building
you see behind me had been suspended twice

48
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:47,370
due to on-site workers being diagnosed
with COVID-19.

49
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,580
When the company went bankrupt,
the building was abandoned

50
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,582
becoming an eyesore
in the middle of the city.

51
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:54,335
Seoul City must act quickly
to resolve this situation.

52
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:05,179
In the United States, over 3.5 million
hotel employees were laid off

53
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,681
in the third quarter alone.

54
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:08,808
I'm telling you
that for the next three to for years

55
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:12,103
there will be no foreign companies
interested in acquiring this hotel.

56
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:13,855
Domestic companies even less so.

57
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:15,857
You make these claims
as though they're facts.

58
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,817
I have a lot of friends
who are future leaders

59
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,652
of Korea's top fifty corporations.

60
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:22,363
I have thoroughly discussed it with them
and reached this conclusion,

61
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,449
so these claims are highly likely
to be factual.

62
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,159
Actually,

63
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:28,536
they are simply facts.

64
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:31,956
You'd be doing well to negotiate with me,
Mr. Vice President.

65
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,915
Mr. Hong.

66
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:37,628
As you know, our bank has already lent
400 billion won to this building.

67
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:40,131
Stating you will only be paying back
300 isn't a negotiation.

68
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:43,176
Shouldn't one be prepared to accept
some losses in the current situation?

69
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,053
How else can business be done?

70
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:48,681
I am not a businessman,
but I am the banker.

71
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:51,809
Uh, Mr. Director, Mr. Vice President,

72
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:53,811
the reason I brought the two of you
over here…

73
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:54,729
Yes.

74
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:58,024
…is to push for a speedy completion
of the construction work on the building

75
00:05:58,107 --> 00:05:59,400
for the citizens' safety.

76
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,361
Talking to him
is like talking to a brick wall.

77
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:04,030
If you're suggesting
that I'm being unreasonable,

78
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:06,699
let me ask you this,
which part of what you said is reasonable?

79
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,710
I must apologize for my tardiness.

80
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:21,714
This is Mr. Kim Myeong-gil.
I mentioned him before our meal.

81
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:23,257
May I introduce you.

82
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:26,344
Assemblyman Seo Woo-hyeon,
a close acquaintance of the mayor,

83
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,596
introduced him to us.

84
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,598
Kim Myeong-gil.

85
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:34,852
KIM MYEONG-GIL

86
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:37,814
I'll contact you individually later today.

87
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,273
Okay.

88
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:44,862
Kim Myeong-gil.

89
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,126
Excuse me,
but what kind of work do you do?

90
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,878
Primarily I deal with investments.

91
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:03,172
When good people request my assistance,

92
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,550
I help them out
to the best of my abilities.

93
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:08,052
So are you a moneylender?

94
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:12,223
Hey, did you know
that this man's a loan shark?

95
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:15,476
Mr. Kim dabbles in various lines of work.

96
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:18,020
You really think this is the right place
to bring this predator?

97
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:23,109
And you must be the eldest son
of Chairman Hong Woo-geun.

98
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,447
When I was young, I worked for someone
named Chairman Bang in Myeong-dong.

99
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,575
You wouldn't remember
since you were a baby at that time,

100
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:32,785
but when the IMF crisis hit Korea,

101
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:35,872
Iil Group nearly went bankrupt
because they didn't have six billion

102
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,457
after fifty years in business.

103
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:41,836
Back then, Chairman Hong Woo-geun
went to my boss, Chairman Bang,

104
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,463
to ask for assistance.

105
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:46,007
He got down on his knees
saying he had to save the company

106
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,091
at whatever cost.

107
00:07:47,633 --> 00:07:50,678
And with all his sincerity
and his passion,

108
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:51,762
he got to Chairman Bang.

109
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:53,931
So then,

110
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:56,601
I filled up a bag
with six billion in cash,

111
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:57,852
and I went over to your house.

112
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:02,482
I also remember your mother prepared
some refreshing Korean melon for me

113
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:03,733
to express her gratitude.

114
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:08,070
There is no dirty money
unless it's used for nefarious agendas,

115
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,740
but when used for good,
that makes it good money.

116
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:14,202
I came here
to extend what support I have to offer.

117
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:20,458
How are the negotiations?

118
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:23,878
There were differences
in the amount they had in mind.

119
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:27,215
- So we were just talking.
- Ah… How much of discrepancy?

120
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:28,466
A hundred billion.

121
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:36,599
Mr. Hong, do you plan on overseeing
hotel operations yourself?

122
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:39,435
I got my master's in hotel management
in Switzerland

123
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:41,437
and worked for four years in Hong Kong.

124
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,648
I see you are well-prepared.

125
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:48,444
With your permission,
I would like to make an investment.

126
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,239
What's your offer?

127
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:55,785
Well… you need 100 billion,
so I'll invest that much.

128
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:02,124
If need be, I will invest more.

129
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,167
What are the terms?

130
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:04,085
Right.

131
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:05,920
There are only three.

132
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:09,423
First off,
I would like to have a small casino

133
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:12,176
built on the highest floor
of the hotel's structure.

134
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,804
Just as you dream of managing a hotel,
Mr. Hong,

135
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,431
well, I dream of operating my own casino.

136
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:19,559
And secondly,

137
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:23,563
I ask that you help me set up a small bar
in the basement of the hotel.

138
00:09:23,646 --> 00:09:25,231
The last thing is,

139
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:27,358
if something like COVID-19
were to spread again,

140
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:30,820
I would like our hotel
to be a quarantine space.

141
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,614
for those without money,
and it will be free of charge.

142
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:35,741
The harder the times get,

143
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:38,494
the more we all should be looking out
for one another.

144
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:41,747
Because… that's how we build
a better world.

145
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:47,712
The 100 billion won investment

146
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:50,715
can be available to you
as early as tomorrow.

147
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:08,566
It went well?

148
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,819
- Mm-hm.
- So they'll bite?

149
00:10:12,403 --> 00:10:15,740
Mm.

150
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,158
Oh yay!

151
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:20,286
So I guess I need to start thinking
about how I want to decorate the bar!

152
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:22,913
Well, uh, people don't go to bars
to see how they're decorated.

153
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:24,540
They go to see the girls.

154
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,459
So you better get busy
hiring some pretty girls.

155
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,128
No, I think you should get busy,
you fucker.

156
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:32,214
You know, it would be better
if you could talk as nice as you look.

157
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,133
What would you know? You prick!

158
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,013
I need to wipe my face.

159
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:40,431
Oh.

160
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:44,226
Here you go.

161
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:00,785
Let's get going.

162
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,707
How's the Seongeun Building?

163
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:10,002
None of the tenants have any ties
to the police or prosecutor's office.

164
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,379
Did you also check in-laws?

165
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:14,131
Yes, of course. I told you
I only overlooked it that one time.

166
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,300
Someone could have a partner who's a cop.

167
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,552
Do your job well
so he doesn't have to worry.

168
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,513
Ah, why don't you worry about yourself?

169
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,098
Jang-do,

170
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:25,601
you should speak to my woman
with more respect.

171
00:11:26,894 --> 00:11:28,604
Yes, you're right. I'm sorry, sir.

172
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,606
Hey, apologize to me, you asshole.

173
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,734
This asshole apologizes to you, ma'am.

174
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:36,487
Hurry up, please.
I could really use a drink.

175
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,530
Yes, sir.

176
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:42,827
This is the 2020 KBFC
Rookie of the Year Tournament.

177
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,787
The Rookie of the Year Tournament
is supposed to be held

178
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:48,290
amidst the loud shouting and cheering
of fans expressing their love and support,

179
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,501
but due to COVID-19,
there are no spectators today.

180
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:52,420
It feels rather gloomy in here,
don't you think?

181
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:53,337
That's right.

182
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:55,548
The Rookie of the Year tournament
is normally a rowdy affair

183
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:56,841
with lots of cheering for everyone.

184
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:01,303
As we speak, we begin
the third round of Hong Woo-jin's match.

185
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:02,972
Now we have a middleweight match here

186
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,598
with Hong Woo-jin in the red trunks,

187
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,684
going up against Jung Jae-hun
in the blue trunks.

188
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:07,601
Get in there.

189
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:09,562
Great combination of body shots.

190
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:11,897
Now we see Hong Woo-jin
leaning against the ropes.

191
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,983
He provokes his opponent
after landing body shots.

192
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,277
Would you look at that provocation.

193
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,446
I mean, I wouldn't go near.

194
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,239
Whoa, a body shot!

195
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:22,450
A clean hit to the body.

196
00:12:22,533 --> 00:12:24,285
He landed a blow to the face.

197
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:26,537
He knocks his opponent down! Hong Woo-jin!

198
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,039
Whoa! A double right
followed by a one-two strike.

199
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:31,959
Look at that footwork.
He has great showmanship.

200
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:33,294
Whoa, it's a KO.

201
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:34,795
KIM RAE-HYEON
KIM GUN-WOO

202
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:37,465
We have Kim Gun-woo
going up against Kim Rae-hyeon.

203
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:40,050
Kim Gun-woo in blue, everybody,
the super rookie in blue trunks.

204
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:43,512
Kim Gun-woo is looking
for a chance with his guard up.

205
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,556
- A body blow!
- He goes to his knees!

206
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:48,142
That's right.
A precision blow to the solar plexus…

207
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:50,186
- That's the end of the match.
- Indeed.

208
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,062
Ending with just one blow.

209
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,940
Kim Gun-woo mows down his opponent
with a single blow again.

210
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:56,484
He's a matchless competitor.

211
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,068
A terrifying rookie has emerged.

212
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:00,446
Things are already getting heated.

213
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:02,281
He's getting cornered.

214
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:08,245
He grabs him and throws him over.
He threw his opponent down.

215
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:09,872
That was against the rules.

216
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:13,375
- He did it first.
- He's too agitated now.

217
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,461
- Box!
- Let's do this!

218
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:18,297
He parts his hair.
Hong's showmanship is unmatched.

219
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,257
That is Hong Woo-jin for you.

220
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:21,884
He provokes. He dodges.

221
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:23,260
Wow! Look at him dodge!

222
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:28,682
Here he goes again…
He connects! We have a knockdown!

223
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,518
It's Hong Woo-jin's specialty.

224
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:32,144
A double jab followed by a straight!

225
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,979
Hong Woo-jin, the marine.

226
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,272
Hong Woo-jin advances again.

227
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:36,398
HONG WOO-JIN

228
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,441
Go lower.

229
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,860
A match between
Kim Gun-woo and Lee Yong-gyu.

230
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:44,365
Kim Gun-woo in the red trunks
is built like a tank.

231
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:45,783
He dodges both blows.

232
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:48,452
Kim Gun-woo's strength lies in infighting.

233
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:51,372
He is leveraging his skills
in close-range hitting.

234
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:53,541
Another punch, and he dodges.

235
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:57,461
A body shot! He brings down his opponent
with one blow!

236
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,088
A left hook to the body.

237
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,382
I had that level of talent
when I was a contender.

238
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:03,551
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

239
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:06,053
That's why you won a gold medal.

240
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,514
Now, Kim Gun-woo versus Hong Woo-jin.

241
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:11,267
- Yeah, let's see.
- Let's find out who takes home the trophy.

242
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,019
No big moves.
Short punches. Use your waist!

243
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:16,856
Watch out for his left hook.
His punches are no joke.

244
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:26,240
Bro, I'm a marine.

245
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:27,157
THE STRONGEST

246
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:28,492
Watch out for his left hook.

247
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,911
And I'm telling you,
I'm an invincible marine.

248
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:34,081
Okay, but don't cry
if you get the shit beat out of you.

249
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:34,999
All right?

250
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,838
- Let's go!
- You got this.

251
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:41,755
Keep your hands up.

252
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,549
Come forward to meet.

253
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:45,801
Now good luck to you both.
To your corners.

254
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,474
His fighting up until now
has truly been a marvel.

255
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:55,686
Kim Gun-woo, the super rookie,
has a very unique fighting style.

256
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:57,897
That's right.
Kim Gun-woo is an infighter

257
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,440
that's good against other infighters.

258
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:00,983
Right.

259
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,192
On the other hand,

260
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:05,654
Hong Woo-jin is an out-boxer
with a counter up his sleeve.

261
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,948
That's right.
Hong Woo-jin knows how to have fun

262
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:09,116
during his matches.

263
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,409
On the other hand,

264
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:13,037
we have his opponent
who stoically plays it by the book.

265
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,831
He's going in! He's going!
He's cornering him!

266
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,500
Can Hong Woo-jin get out?
Can he get out of this?

267
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,669
Wow! He got out of that really well.

268
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:23,547
Hong Woo-jin is just remarkably fast.

269
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:26,425
And since Kim Gun-woo
is also a middleweight…

270
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:28,636
Wow,
he goes for a wild swing!

271
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:31,055
Here we go. He guards the body shot.

272
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:33,015
Kim Gun-woo has a great defense.

273
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:35,351
- Doesn't he?
- He's like a rock.

274
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,936
And he keeps on guarding.

275
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,687
Uppercut!

276
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,481
He landed that one.

277
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:41,774
Indeed he did.

278
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:43,484
What a performance this is.

279
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:45,945
A right hook! Wow, what a dodge.

280
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:50,074
Hong Woo-jin is
constantly applying nonstop pressure.

281
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:53,327
- Another left.
- Can he recover?

282
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,371
And Hong Woo-jin-- He goes down.

283
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,623
- He's down!
- One… two…

284
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:59,625
- Three… four
- With stomach blows,

285
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,085
the shock does not come right away.

286
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:04,213
It takes around five seconds.
That is when it hits.

287
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:06,256
- 
- Six, seven…

288
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,092
He gets up
after five seconds.

289
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:09,802
He recovered well from that one.

290
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:10,803
Yes, he did.

291
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:12,930
But that has definitely got to sting.

292
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:15,307
There's going to be an aftereffect.

293
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:16,433
I think so.

294
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,060
Come on.

295
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:23,565
Come on!

296
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,008
Come on.

297
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:52,052
Hey… come get some.

298
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:54,888
Son of a bitch.

299
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,893
Come get me!

300
00:17:01,603 --> 00:17:03,105
Will he take the bait?

301
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:05,357
- Kim Gun-woo has a lot to think about.
- Come on!

302
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,735
And there he goes! Will he connect?

303
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:11,155
Stop! One, two…

304
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:13,574
Three… four…

305
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:15,409
His tactics really backfired.

306
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:16,326
KO!

307
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,078
Kim Gun-woo went in for the kill

308
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:21,790
and ended the match
once again with the same body shot.

309
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,293
I'll tell you something.
That body shot is ruthless.

310
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:29,590
You all right?

311
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,843
I have tainted the honor
of my fellow marines.

312
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:35,095
A blow to the liver will do that.

313
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,639
Okay, I'm out of here.

314
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:39,892
What about dinner, huh?

315
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:41,810
There's the pandemic.

316
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,104
I mean,
your boy has just gone through a lot.

317
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,564
The least you can do is feed him.

318
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:02,915
Go home and order in.

319
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:06,960
Later.

320
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:19,973
Oh.

321
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:24,853
What? Huh? What?

322
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:26,855
Wanna grab a bite?

323
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:29,274
Why would I wanna grab food with you?

324
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:32,277
I was gonna get some pork belly.
Thought you might want some.

325
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:36,573
Are you pitying me?

326
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:37,991
No.

327
00:18:38,075 --> 00:18:40,202
Go ask those other assholes you KO'd
to eat with you.

328
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,912
But they all went home.

329
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,804
- Wasn't the prize money ten million?
- Yeah.

330
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,057
Then why settle for pork belly?

331
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,392
Let's get rib eye.

332
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:06,145
- I'm only going to spend 50,000.
- Why?

333
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,980
I need to give the rest to my mom.

334
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:10,107
- Do you owe your mom money?
- No.

335
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,066
Then why?

336
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,443
I have to pay the rent for her store.

337
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,404
You're a good son.

338
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:17,614
Just spend an extra 10,000.

339
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:20,284
This barbecue buffet I know
charges 29,000 a person.

340
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:22,035
It's insane, and they serve Korean beef.

341
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,954
- You serious?
- Of course not, idiot.

342
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:28,500
How could they afford
to serve Korean beef that cheap?

343
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,377
Do you spend all your time working out?

344
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:33,881
Anyway, that buffet is all right.
Just spend a little more.

345
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:34,798
No.

346
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,093
Hey.

347
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:48,896
Let's go.

348
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,107
How is your left hook so strong?

349
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:54,610
Back when I worked part-time
at a junkyard,

350
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:56,028
I practiced my hooks on a tire.

351
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:57,279
Just your left?

352
00:19:58,405 --> 00:19:59,781
Why would I only work on my left?

353
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:01,867
No, I'm asking
if you only worked on your left.

354
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,785
No, of course I hit with both hands.

355
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,537
Then why is your left so strong?

356
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:08,874
- Actually, my right is stronger.
- Then why use only your left?

357
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:11,293
Because I couldn't find a good time
to use my right.

358
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:13,545
What a show-off.

359
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:15,422
You think so?

360
00:20:15,505 --> 00:20:17,674
You're saying you could take
everyone down with just your left.

361
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:19,468
At least today, yes.

362
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,386
Yeah, see? What a show-off.

363
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,347
Actually, I consider myself humble.

364
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,306
Flip the pork already.

365
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:26,308
Not yet. It needs 30 more seconds.

366
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,143
Well, I think it's ready now.

367
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,229
You're wrong.
I worked part-time at a barbecue place.

368
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:31,355
I know my meat.

369
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:34,024
Damn, bro,
you've worked a lot of part-time jobs.

370
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:35,525
- Are you poor?
- Mm-hm.

371
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:37,069
My family lost everything.

372
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:40,405
How?

373
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:45,244
My dad was a researcher
for a large corporation.

374
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:47,871
He sued them for wrongful termination
and ended up losing the suit.

375
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:51,250
Legal fees from back then all became debt.

376
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,753
You can't beat the big companies.
The rich always come out on top.

377
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:55,879
That's true.

378
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,551
- What were your other gigs?
- Well, I dabbled in this and that.

379
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,553
For the most part,
I made deliveries with my mom.

380
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:06,265
I guess you're a world-class part-timer.

381
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,435
Oh!

382
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:13,021
You are good at everything.
You've led a good life.

383
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:15,107
I see you grill with your right hand.

384
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:17,567
So when did you start boxing?

385
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:20,195
Uh, about three years ago.

386
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,281
- After school?
- After my military service.

387
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:23,532
Ah…

388
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:26,285
I first put on my gloves
for the first time in sixth grade.

389
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:27,995
My dad was on the national team.

390
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:30,122
Wow, that's so cool.

391
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,540
And so what's your father's name?

392
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:32,499
Hong Seong-geun.

393
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,501
Barcelona bronze medalist.

394
00:21:34,584 --> 00:21:36,169
- Oh.
- Know him?

395
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:37,379
No.

396
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:40,048
Most boxers seem to know him.

397
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:42,134
Oh. Sorry.

398
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:45,429
I assume
your dad taught you how to box, right?

399
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,222
We aren't that close.

400
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:48,932
Why?

401
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,435
My dad is never satisfied
with anything that I do.

402
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:54,062
He won his bronze medal at my age,

403
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:57,107
so he judges me
based on his accomplishments.

404
00:21:57,607 --> 00:21:58,775
Hm.

405
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:01,028
So you're basically saying

406
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:03,363
that your dad won a bronze medal
at the Olympics

407
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:04,948
when he was only twenty-five years old?

408
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:07,617
No, twenty-seven.

409
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:12,247
Oh, how old are you?

410
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,041
Twenty-seven.

411
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:15,208
Uh,

412
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:18,879
I'm sorry, man. I'm actually twenty-five.
I'm sorry. Please forgive my manners.

413
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:20,756
Ah, you ass!

414
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:21,673
Please forgive me.

415
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:22,799
- Hey.
- Yes?

416
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,593
Learn to respect your elders, got it?

417
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:25,927
- Yes.
- Understand?

418
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,304
Sure.

419
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:28,889
Flip it now.

420
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:31,266
Oh, not yet.
It still needs one more minute.

421
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,518
- I said to flip it.
- I can't do that.

422
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:37,147
Oh god, you are one stubborn punk, bro.
You've served in the army?

423
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:40,192
Yes, I told you earlier I started boxing
after I finished my military service.

424
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:41,568
Yeah, you did.

425
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:43,737
What I mean is,
where were you stationed, huh?

426
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,072
- Oh.
- You need to learn to keep up.

427
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:47,240
Um, yes, I was in the Marine Corps.

428
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:51,161
Hey! I'm a marine too!

429
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:52,579
Oh.

430
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:53,663
What class?

431
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:56,041
Uh, I was in the 1,207th class.

432
00:22:58,293 --> 00:23:01,004
Sir! I was in the 1,216th class, sir!

433
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:03,840
What are you doing? Sit. Please sit.

434
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:05,550
I will sit when you return my salute, sir.

435
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:06,927
Oh, uh…

436
00:23:10,639 --> 00:23:11,973
So you're Marine Kim Gun-woo.

437
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:13,767
- Mm.
- So which division did you serve?

438
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:15,227
The First Division.

439
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,229
Me too! Which battalion were you in, sir?

440
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:20,732
- Recon.
- Amazing.

441
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,361
I also wanted to get into reconnaissance,
but I didn't make the cut.

442
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:27,072
- Mm.
- The pride of the Marines, recon.

443
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:29,324
Recon!

444
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:30,700
Ah!

445
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:33,453
You can still call me "bro," okay?
Let's just speak casually.

446
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:35,622
I understand, sir.

447
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:36,998
Yeah, but let's be casual.

448
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:38,542
Casual it is, sir.

449
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:39,584
Bro.

450
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:40,502
Hm?

451
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:41,878
Here.

452
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:49,219
Yeah, I have a crazy amount of pride
as a marine.

453
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:50,137
Why?

454
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,681
I was kind of a thug back in Incheon,

455
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:53,932
but I joined the Marine Corps,

456
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:55,725
met some nice people,
and came to my senses.

457
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,060
I just loved it all.

458
00:23:57,144 --> 00:24:00,856
Going through tough training together
and overcoming it all.

459
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,274
This looks delicious.

460
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:05,360
Waking up in the morning,
going on runs, sweating bullets,

461
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:06,987
then showering together,

462
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:09,030
washing each, all that, you know.

463
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:12,451
- You're one of those crazy marines?
- Of course not.

464
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:13,702
You have to try this.

465
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,247
How is it? How is it?

466
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,126
It's practically steak.

467
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:23,086
Really?

468
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:24,754
Let me show you something.

469
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:27,215
- Watch this.
- Wow, yes.

470
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,259
- Three pieces with ssamjang.
- Yes, yes, yes, yes.

471
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:30,677
Want some kimchi with that too?

472
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:34,973
Ah, ah.

473
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:37,017
- Marine Kim Gun-woo, sir.
- Yeah?

474
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:41,229
Mm. Mm.

475
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,523
- Amazing. Amazing, right?
- Uh-huh. Mm-hm

476
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:44,983
- Want to get some soju?
- No.

477
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:46,943
- Why? Because of your diet?
- Mm-hm.

478
00:24:47,027 --> 00:24:48,445
You're such a perfectionist.

479
00:24:48,528 --> 00:24:50,280
You're too much.

480
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:51,198
Excuse me!

481
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:52,616
A beer!

482
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:55,744
Please. Ah!

483
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:59,080
Bro, how much were your shoes?

484
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:00,999
- 1.2 mill.
- Seriously?

485
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:04,169
Why so expensive?
That's a month's rent for our store.

486
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:05,795
Damn, you are really gullible.

487
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:07,297
Obviously they're knockoffs.

488
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,008
Well, they look real.

489
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,302
Knockoffs have shiny toe caps, see?

490
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:13,803
And the real ones are suede.

491
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:15,931
The threads around the holes
are pretty shitty too.

492
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,141
Tell me if you wanna buy some.

493
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:19,768
I can get you better than the real thing.

494
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,853
- Really?
- Are you shitting me? No, bro.

495
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:25,106
There's nothing in the world
that tops the real deal, all right?

496
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:28,860
You should hang out with me more,
so we can work on your street smarts.

497
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:30,779
You spend too much time
on your part-time jobs.

498
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:36,326
Do you know about this?
I heard it's very common these days.

499
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:38,912
"COVID-19 special loans."

500
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:40,330
COVID-19 SUPPORT
SUPER LOW-INTEREST SPECIAL LOAN

501
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:41,540
Back in the day,

502
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:45,669
I was so strapped for cash,
that I worked in money lending.

503
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:47,587
Desperate people are easier to rip off.

504
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:49,965
The pandemic has made
many people desperate.

505
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:54,970
So I guess now
all the loan sharks have come out to play.

506
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:55,887
Really?

507
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:58,807
Since everyone is rushing
to cover their rent,

508
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,351
all the sharks need to do
is shake their hand and suck them dry.

509
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:06,565
My mom is also having a hard time
because of the rent payments for her café.

510
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:09,859
The business makes less than a fourth
of what we used to,

511
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:11,987
but the landlord still takes
the same amount of rent.

512
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:15,865
If we close down now,
it would cost us more to move out,

513
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:17,826
so we're just trying to stay afloat.

514
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:20,537
Apparently, you have to return the store
to its original state.

515
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:22,622
Damn.

516
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:27,627
Here.

517
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:32,257
I'll treat you
to something real fancy next time.

518
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,427
- Are we gonna have rib eye?
- Ah, just come with me.

519
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,970
I know a good barbecue place.

520
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:38,305
You aren't messing with me?

521
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:42,350
Hey, do you think I would tell
such a low-level lie to a senior marine?

522
00:26:42,434 --> 00:26:45,395
- I think you would.
- So you don't believe me?

523
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:47,897
I just mean
because you've been lying to me all day.

524
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:50,775
Man, those were just jokes.

525
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:52,569
All right, I promise no more lies.

526
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,071
Deal.

527
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,115
I know.

528
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,075
I am so sorry.

529
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:00,368
I tried my best.

530
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,454
I just couldn't…

531
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,748
…get it together in time.

532
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:09,794
Yes, if I just get through this month,
I will come up with it somehow.

533
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:12,213
Again, I am sorry.

534
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:15,050
Oh, uh, sorry.

535
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:17,010
- Let me call you back in the morning.
- Mom!

536
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:20,263
My boy!

537
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:21,931
Oh my boy!

538
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:25,852
Look at you. You were incredible today.

539
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:28,146
- You watched it?
- Oh, of course I watched it.

540
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:30,940
The commentators kept talking about you
the whole time.

541
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:33,777
- Are you serious?
- Yes, they kept saying you're perfect.

542
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,363
So I guess I should watch it too then.

543
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:37,489
- Mom, hold on.
- Look at you.

544
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:39,199
I'm so proud of you.

545
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,326
Here.

546
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:43,161
What's that?

547
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,997
The prize, so we can pay the rent.

548
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,417
Oh.

549
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:51,836
Oh, no, no. I can't take this.

550
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,423
No, Mom, I won this to give it to you.

551
00:27:58,885 --> 00:28:01,888
Let's pay… Uncle back first
for what we owe.

552
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,601
How… how do you know about your uncle?

553
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:09,979
He's also going through a lot, Mom.
Let's pay him back.

554
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:15,568
All right.

555
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:19,489
But listen, I will pay you back for this
with interest.

556
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:23,034
- Okay.
- Oh, thank you.

557
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:29,207
- Let's go, Mom.
- Ah, it's so cold. Let's go.

558
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:31,292
Did you eat?

559
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:32,335
Yeah, of course.

560
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:33,795
Oh, with who?

561
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,630
The guy I fought in the finals.

562
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:40,802
Oh, the boy with the curly hair?

563
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:41,845
Yeah, that one.

564
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:44,973
Mom, did you eat?

565
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:46,516
Oh, sure, sure. I ate.

566
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:06,035
Sir.

567
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:07,537
How are things?

568
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:09,706
Sir, as you predicted,

569
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:12,834
all tenants owed money to banks
or second-tier financial companies.

570
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:16,629
So my plan is to bring all of them to us
by next week.

571
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:19,549
Okay, can you make it happen by this week?

572
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,969
Assemblyman Seo keeps badgering me
to kick them out quickly.

573
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,513
I'll see what I can do, sir.

574
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,724
Yes, let's hurry things along.

575
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:30,268
The sales team's operations are key,
aren't they?

576
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:31,895
Yes, they are.

577
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:37,567
Beom, listen.

578
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:40,612
Let's get ready.

579
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:03,301
I am team manager Yoo In-yeong
from Smile Capital.

580
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:05,345
We are a financial company

581
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:07,806
that was recently government-certified
for excellence,

582
00:30:07,889 --> 00:30:11,226
and I was wondering
if you had some time for a quick chat.

583
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:12,143
Okay.

584
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:15,897
Your business doesn't get many visitors
these days, huh?

585
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:18,316
No.

586
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:21,152
I believe you owe the bank 40 million won.
Is that accurate, sir?

587
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:22,612
Yeah.

588
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:26,074
Once you sign here,
we will pay off that debt today.

589
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:31,412
And we have an interest rate of 5%
which is way lower than the bank's 7%.

590
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:34,415
Doesn't that end up leaving you
without any actual profit?

591
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:35,416
That's true.

592
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,962
But, uh, the government has started
a special support project

593
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:40,880
to help the small business owners

594
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:43,091
who are struggling
because of the pandemic.

595
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:44,175
We won a support package,

596
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:47,136
which allows us to lower interest rates
even more than the other companies.

597
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:50,098
A 2% difference in interest
is not a small amount

598
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:53,768
In times like these,
just staying afloat is winning.

599
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:57,188
We know this pandemic will pass soon.

600
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:58,523
DEBT REPAYMENT
AND NEW CONTRACT AGREEMENT

601
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:01,192
But we want to extend
whatever help we can,

602
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:02,777
so that you can keep your business.

603
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:07,031
It's true this is good for us too.

604
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:09,325
but it's really good for you, sir,

605
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,831
- Yes, thank you.
- Thank you so much.

606
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:16,332
SMILE CAPITAL
SIGNEE YOON SO-YEON

607
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:33,516
Huh?

608
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,018
TEMPORARILY CLOSED
DUE TO A CONFIRMED COVID-19 PATIENT

609
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:38,897
We had dinner last night
with some of the other members at the gym.

610
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,982
Apparently, one of them tested positive.

611
00:31:42,025 --> 00:31:44,402
Oh, do you think I should get tested too?

612
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:45,486
No, you're fine.

613
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:48,364
Anyway, your match was just yesterday.

614
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:50,074
Why did I hear
that you're back at the gym?

615
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:52,535
- To work out. Why else?
- Gun-woo.

616
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,329
Please take a week off and rest.

617
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:56,205
Rest doing what?

618
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:58,917
Nothing. If you're doing something,
you're not resting.

619
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,752
Just don't do anything and try to relax.

620
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:02,337
Okay.

621
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:15,183
GU-NOO

622
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,525
Uh, what are you up to?

623
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:27,528
Sleep.

624
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:30,031
- Huh?
- Sleeping.

625
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:33,576
- Uh, I can't hear you.
- Sleep, sleeping.

626
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,954
I am sleeping.

627
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:40,291
- Well, do you want to work out?
- No.

628
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:42,126
Ah, but I'm bored.

629
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:45,380
God, so clingy so early in the morning.

630
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,298
Let's hang out. Hm?

631
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:52,720
I'll send my address. Come.

632
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,597
Okay, sounds good.

633
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,031
Oh shit!

634
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:14,617
Fuck! Goddammit. Stop!

635
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:16,452
You son of a bitch!

636
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:04,042
Are you all right?

637
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,251
Uh, okay, wait here.

638
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:33,529
Who?

639
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:34,489
Huh?

640
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:36,449
Why'd you follow me?

641
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:38,242
Tell me who sent you.

642
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,538
To help.

643
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:44,957
What? Help who?

644
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,836
I thought that man was being chased,

645
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,630
and, uh, I didn't know what was going on.

646
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:52,840
- God fucking dammit.
- Huh?

647
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,717
That asshole is a fake.

648
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:57,220
- Huh?
- Just butt out of things you don't know.

649
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:59,764
Motherfucker.

650
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:05,728
Huh?

651
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:36,092
What brings you here?

652
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:38,010
Everything went well.

653
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:40,138
I mean with Mi-yeon's surgery yesterday.

654
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:42,390
Oh, really? And how is she doing now?

655
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,016
She's good, sir.

656
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:46,018
She's recovering very well.

657
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:49,939
It's all thanks to you.

658
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:52,692
If you hadn't helped us back then, sir,

659
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:55,736
my daughter might have died.

660
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:00,158
Here.

661
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:05,121
My husband had the good fortune
of moving over to a larger company,

662
00:36:05,204 --> 00:36:07,373
so he just received his severance.

663
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:11,043
I came here
as soon as the money hit our accounts

664
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:14,130
because I wanted to pay you back
before I paid anyone else.

665
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:19,218
You can take your time to pay me back.

666
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:22,263
First, pay back your urgent debts.

667
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:23,848
Oh, no, sir.

668
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:26,475
Please. Please accept this.

669
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:29,437
I finally have some piece of mind.

670
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:33,941
Thank you so much, sir.

671
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:38,362
Thank you so much. Thank you so much.

672
00:36:41,073 --> 00:36:43,284
Thank you.

673
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:00,927
MI-YEON'S MOTHER APRIL 14TH, 2018
20 MILLION WON

674
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:12,772
KOREAN ANTIQUE MALL

675
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:34,126
I found Yang Jae-myeong.

676
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:36,629
He tried telling me he had no money,

677
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:38,005
so I took this from him.

678
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:43,928
This watch goes for over 20 million won.

679
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:45,054
So what?

680
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:48,057
Yang Jae-myeong borrowed ten million won.

681
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:50,518
Yeah, plus interest.

682
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:57,191
Oh, did you get hurt?

683
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,735
I got in a scuffle
with Yang Jae-myeong.

684
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:03,239
By the way,
while we're already on the subject,

685
00:38:03,322 --> 00:38:04,490
you and I need to talk.

686
00:38:04,573 --> 00:38:05,783
Have some rice cakes first.

687
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:09,161
We need to talk.
Don't try to change the subject.

688
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:12,999
How long are you going to keep at it?

689
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:15,251
What?

690
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,213
Lending people money with no interest.

691
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,965
I mean, it's not profitable.

692
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:22,550
What do you mean by that?

693
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:25,845
I always pay you
your 30% in commission fees.

694
00:38:25,928 --> 00:38:28,097
Not for me. For you, Grandpa.

695
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:33,644
You know Mi-yeon's mother?

696
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:35,771
Yeah, and?

697
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:39,358
She dropped by earlier
and paid back the entire sum in cash.

698
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:42,361
And that's the interest?

699
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:45,656
Hyeon-ju.

700
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,909
A sick child got a timely operation
that saved her.

701
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,536
Because I lent them money,

702
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:53,664
her parents didn't have to use their home
as collateral for a loan.

703
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:57,168
And now, when their child's better,
she has a home to go to.

704
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:00,296
You and I saved a family.

705
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:04,091
This is the most precious form of interest
in the world.

706
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,847
Well, anyway, I heard something

707
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:12,016
while digging around
for Yang Jae-myeong's whereabouts.

708
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:15,394
He and his crew are dressing up
as homeless people

709
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:18,022
and robbing the actual homeless
of their IDs

710
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:19,357
to take out loans in their names.

711
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,067
And who are these people?

712
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,319
They're not exactly the cream of the crop.

713
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:24,403
They met in prison.

714
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:26,447
You knew this,
and you went all by yourself?

715
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:28,991
Should I have you tag along next time?

716
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:31,786
Anyway, let me do some digging.

717
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:34,080
I think I will find something interesting.

718
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:35,998
As long as you're not in danger, okay?

719
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:37,458
Sure.

720
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:50,471
PRESIDENT MOON GWANG-MU

721
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:52,681
MARINE
IF IT DOESN'T WORK, MAKE IT WORK!

722
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:53,599
Hello?

723
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:56,477
Hi. Oh, is this a bad time?

724
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,770
No, sir. No, please go ahead.

725
00:39:57,853 --> 00:40:00,856
Yes, I wanted to ask you a favor
to find someone.

726
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,024
One second, please.

727
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:04,819
All right, I'm listening.

728
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:06,904
"A good person."

729
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:09,657
"A skilled bodyguard

730
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:13,285
who is familiar with the loan business."

731
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:17,748
All right, sir.

732
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,835
I will find the best candidates.
I promise I will find the best.

733
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:22,753
I'll leave it in your hands.

734
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:24,797
Yes, sir. Anytime.

735
00:40:26,715 --> 00:40:29,051
Mayweather is the top dog. No doubt.

736
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:31,303
But Mayweather feels
more like a businessman

737
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:32,471
than an actual boxer.

738
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:33,389
That's right.

739
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:36,434
My guy's in it for the money,
but he is ridiculously good at it.

740
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:38,978
Probably made a few hundred billion.

741
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,771
Does money matter to you?

742
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:43,357
What could matter more than money?

743
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:45,192
The heart of a boxer.

744
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,196
What?

745
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:54,076
What?

746
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:58,873
- Dude.
- No, No. Sorry.

747
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:02,001
It's just you got so serious
all of a sudden.

748
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:04,545
You looked so serious
that it really caught me off guard.

749
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:06,881
Elaborate on this boxer's heart.

750
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:08,340
Hm.

751
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:11,927
I think Manny Pacquiao
is the best example because--

752
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:15,306
Pow! Pow, pow, Pacquiao! Pow, pow.

753
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:18,642
Come on, dude. Let me have my moment.
I never cut you off, man.

754
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:22,605
I'm sorry, marine.
I will never cut you off.

755
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:26,942
Well, I really admire Pacquiao's heart,
you know? He never gives up.

756
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:30,738
Okay, I can give him that,
but Mayweather made a lot more money.

757
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:34,658
But I bet a lot more kids started dreaming
of becoming a boxer because of Pacquiao.

758
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,160
That's true for me at least.

759
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:40,539
That's the kind of person I want to be.

760
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:44,168
A person who shows
that with strong will and undying passion,

761
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:46,212
anyone will be able to achieve
all of their dreams.

762
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:47,796
It's windy today.

763
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,965
That is a true boxer's heart

764
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:53,594
and the kind of hope we should inspire
in the people watching us.

765
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:56,138
- A boxer's heart--
- Hey, this is ready.

766
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:57,181
Let's eat.

767
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,184
Here.

768
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:07,399
- Is it good?
- So good.

769
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:10,819
Hey, what do you do for a living?

770
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:14,907
I used to teach gym classes
at a kindergarten my friend runs.

771
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,492
A gym teacher of sorts.

772
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:18,536
Ah, that doesn't suit you, right?

773
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:19,828
What do you mean?

774
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:21,830
Kids fucking love me.

775
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:24,375
Well, anyway,
I used to do that in the morning,

776
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:26,001
then worked out in the afternoons.

777
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:27,920
Since the kindergarten shut down,
I'm in a bind.

778
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:32,258
Hey, wanna go on deliveries with me?

779
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:34,134
You can make some serious money
on parcel runs.

780
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:36,637
- Is the pay good?
- Yeah.

781
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,305
If we put our minds to it,

782
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,766
we could probably make 200,000 each.

783
00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:41,725
For real?

784
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,811
Yeah, delivery work is also good cardio.

785
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:45,729
And you get to work on
your non-boxing muscles,

786
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:47,147
so it's good for your balance too.

787
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:50,651
- Ah, killing two birds with one stone.
- Three birds.

788
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:51,569
Huh?

789
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:54,572
You make money, get your cardio in,
and work on your balance.

790
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:57,157
Yeah, cardio and balance are the same.

791
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:58,993
Uh, no, they're not.

792
00:43:00,995 --> 00:43:04,415
Wait, but aren't you supposed to compete
in the Super Series

793
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:06,375
since you won
the Rookie of the Year tournament?

794
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:09,795
Mm-hm, but it's been postposed
due to COVID.

795
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:14,592
How much longer?

796
00:43:15,301 --> 00:43:16,552
There's nothing I can do.

797
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:23,142
Except I'll make sure I'm ready to fight
whenever the time actually comes.

798
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:29,690
You know… you have a boxer's heart.

799
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:38,407
Hm?

800
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:40,367
- Come on, Pacquiao.
- Right now?

801
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:48,083
Whoa…

802
00:43:49,251 --> 00:43:50,711
Man, how could you hit me for real?

803
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:52,004
Whoa, my bad. Sorry.

804
00:43:52,087 --> 00:43:53,547
Hey, come here, come here. Come here.

805
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:54,715
Let go. Let go.

806
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:57,885
- Come here. Let go. Come here. Come here.
- Whoa! Whoa!

807
00:43:57,968 --> 00:44:00,095
Come here. Hey, Kim Gun-woo!

808
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:04,224
Everyone, cheers!

809
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:10,939
Now for today's main event.
The greatest show on Earth!

810
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:13,817
Cracking a watermelon with In-beom!

811
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:17,112
Everyone, come on! Make your bets now!

812
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:18,489
A million that he fails!

813
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:23,243
Hey! Three million on his success.

814
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:27,623
And if I'm the winner of this pot,
everything is on me!

815
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:29,249
Beom,
I know you can crack it,

816
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:31,669
but I'm gonna bet four million
that you can't

817
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:36,423
- Kang In-beom!
- Let's go!

818
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:39,134
- Kang In-beom!
- Kang In-beom!

819
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:41,178
Kang In-beom!

820
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:43,972
He cracked it!

821
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:47,768
Tteokbokki for all! Yeah!

822
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:49,645
Let's have some tteokbokki!

823
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:50,813
Awesome job!

824
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:51,814
Woo!

825
00:44:51,897 --> 00:44:53,315
I did well, didn't I?

826
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:54,650
DEAREST MAYOR

827
00:44:56,902 --> 00:44:58,570
Shh. Quiet. Quiet!

828
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,120
Yes, Mr. Mayor.

829
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:09,832
Yes.

830
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:13,627
Yes.

831
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:18,674
Yes.

832
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:21,385
I understand, sir.

833
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:22,761
I will let him know.

834
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:25,222
Have a good evening, sir.

835
00:45:29,101 --> 00:45:31,770
The mayor… has just decided that

836
00:45:33,522 --> 00:45:34,690
he will back the casino bid.

837
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:37,401
- Yes.
- Yes!

838
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:48,996
I have prepared… a small gift for you,
Mr. Park, in honor of your birthday.

839
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:55,377
Open it.

840
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:03,594
Almost four kilos.

841
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:09,683
Mr. Park, these gold turtles are so clean
that no one will know if you have them.

842
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:12,269
I give you this with the hope

843
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:15,272
that our relationship will continue
for a long time.

844
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:18,692
So I would appreciate if you take them.

845
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:29,870
You don't want to be in City Hall forever.

846
00:46:31,538 --> 00:46:33,415
I know you have big dreams, Mr. Park.

847
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:36,502
If you plan on going
to the National Assembly,

848
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:38,170
you will definitely need money.

849
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:40,881
Let us forge a lasting partnership.

850
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:43,759
I will support you every way I can.

851
00:46:45,427 --> 00:46:48,889
My money never has known failure.
You can rest assured.

852
00:47:02,986 --> 00:47:05,864
- Hey. Hey!
- Jeez.

853
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:08,367
Hey, where are we going?

854
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:10,953
Please get in carefully.
We'll take you home.

855
00:47:11,036 --> 00:47:12,496
Let's go.

856
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:20,337
And Assemblyman Seo's building?

857
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:22,798
Just wait until Friday, sir.

858
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:26,134
All the stores will have
over 20 million in interest.

859
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:28,679
I think the small stores
need a little grilling.

860
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:31,139
People tend to give up faster

861
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:34,268
if they see their first-floor storefront
in complete shambles

862
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:36,436
every time they come into work, you know?

863
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:39,523
I'll do as you wish, sir.

864
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:43,485
Since Mr. Jung is not feeling well
and can't join you,

865
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:46,446
call them and tell them to send over
15 intimidating men.

866
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:47,990
Beom can wrap things up.

867
00:47:48,073 --> 00:47:49,533
Should they be armed?

868
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:51,159
There's no need.

869
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:54,162
Tell them to suit up
and make sure that everyone is masked.

870
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:56,415
Sir, I think five men should be enough.

871
00:47:56,498 --> 00:47:59,459
I'm sure that the boss has his reasons.

872
00:48:01,461 --> 00:48:02,713
You're right.

873
00:48:03,338 --> 00:48:04,590
I've made a huge mistake.

874
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:09,553
You shitheads, there you go again.

875
00:48:09,636 --> 00:48:11,430
Come on. Focus.

876
00:48:12,764 --> 00:48:13,891
Where should we begin?

877
00:48:51,219 --> 00:48:52,054
Huh?

878
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:54,848
Oh, hello. Good evening.

879
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:57,184
Why didn't you keep your promise?

880
00:48:58,810 --> 00:48:59,645
What?

881
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:01,480
You agreed to an extension fee

882
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:04,608
in exchange for a lowered interest rate.

883
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:06,360
Uh, what?

884
00:49:07,819 --> 00:49:12,658
But you needed to pay that extension fee,
which is 10% of the principal,

885
00:49:13,241 --> 00:49:14,868
within 24 hours of signing.

886
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:16,787
It says so on the contract.

887
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:18,914
But because you failed to do so,

888
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:22,417
your extension
has accrued 40 million in interest.

889
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:24,211
Not to mention
your credit score has dropped,

890
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:26,672
so your interest rate has gone up to 20%.

891
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:32,135
We really… started
with the purest of intentions.

892
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:35,347
You ruined everything, damn it!

893
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:39,101
What are you going to do now?

894
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:41,520
Do you have that kind of money?

895
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:46,650
I will call the police.

896
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:48,402
Police?

897
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:51,154
Yeah.

898
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:03,959
Oh my God.

899
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:12,259
Hey, Mom.

900
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:13,885
Hey, son, where are you?

901
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:17,389
- I'm almost there.
- Okay, I'm at the store.

902
00:50:17,472 --> 00:50:19,558
And a bunch of strange people came over…

903
00:50:19,641 --> 00:50:21,435
Strange people? Who?

904
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:22,602
They're still here.

905
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:26,189
Mom? What's going on?

906
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:01,183
Where the hell
do you think you're going?

907
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:04,019
Who the hell are you? Get lost!

908
00:51:05,103 --> 00:51:07,272
Hey! I told you to scram, asshole!

909
00:51:09,691 --> 00:51:11,359
This jackass! Hey, you!

910
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:15,322
- What's going on? Get him.
- You shithead!

911
00:51:15,405 --> 00:51:17,074
Who the hell is this guy?

912
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:31,088
Fuck!

913
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:33,840
- Come here.
- Little shit!

914
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:27,519
- Mom, are you all right?
- Yes.

915
00:52:27,602 --> 00:52:28,645
You aren't hurt, are you?

916
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:31,481
I'm okay. I'm okay.

917
00:52:41,449 --> 00:52:42,367
Who are you?

918
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:46,454
Who are you to do this to our store?

919
00:52:47,789 --> 00:52:49,666
I asked you, "Who are you?"

920
00:53:09,102 --> 00:53:10,437
Calm down, kid.

921
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:14,691
Your mother has borrowed some money
from our company.

922
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:17,569
Mm-hm

923
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:20,405
So what do you want?

924
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:22,908
Pay us back.

925
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:25,327
Pay us for the damages first.

926
00:53:47,098 --> 00:53:48,183
Go ahead.

927
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:01,863
Mom, it's okay.
Just go over there for a second.

928
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:03,907
Gun-woo!

929
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:21,609
Gun-woo!

930
00:55:50,013 --> 00:55:51,848
Gun-woo!

931
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:11,076
That's enough.

932
00:56:35,016 --> 00:56:38,978
Hey, I appreciate people with grit.

933
00:56:40,855 --> 00:56:44,442
Because guys with grit…
They can get anything done.

934
00:56:47,695 --> 00:56:49,280
Do you want to work for me?

935
00:56:49,364 --> 00:56:50,865
I will make sure that…
