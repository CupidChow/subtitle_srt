1
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:23,023
huh?

2
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:26,359
The fuck?
Who the hell are you?

3
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:37,996
Come on. Come on, you son of a bitch.

4
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:39,539
Asshole!

5
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,753
Fuck this shit.

6
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:46,463
Let's go.

7
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:48,923
Oh…

8
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:54,471
Bro, we gotta call an ambulance.

9
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:57,015
That's a bad idea, Gun-woo.

10
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:59,684
Dude, this guy is dying.

11
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:16,826
Uh, Hyeon-ju,

12
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,995
a homeless old man
was injured really badly,

13
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,413
so we called an ambulance.

14
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:24,459
- What about Yang Jae-myeong?
- Uh, he ran away.

15
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:26,503
Goddammit! I told you not to get involved.

16
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,546
I mean, he was really badly hurt.

17
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:29,506
We had no choice.

18
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:32,133
You don't even know the guy,
so why would you interfere? Damn it!

19
00:01:32,217 --> 00:01:34,636
Uh, I know, but we--

20
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:40,141
So what should we do?

21
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:46,397
I'll give her a call.

22
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:53,988
What?

23
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:58,201
Yes, Hyeon-ju, uh, about this…
We are really, really sorry.

24
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:00,328
This was totally our fault 100 times over.

25
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:03,039
Where are you right now?
Just let me apologize to you in person.

26
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,916
Forget it. It's over.

27
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:08,128
Please, Hyeon-ju,
just give us five minutes.

28
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:12,006
We just… feel really badly,
and I'm sorry about the whole thing.

29
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,425
Gun-woo also wants to apologize.

30
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,761
- Please, just give us five minutes.
-

31
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:18,179
Come on.

32
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,973
Meet me at the bookstore.

33
00:02:32,193 --> 00:02:33,236
Dude, look…

34
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:37,323
To be honest with you,
I really don't get it.

35
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:38,616
What don't you get, huh?

36
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,119
I mean,
if we didn't do anything to help him,

37
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:42,829
that old man would've definitely died.

38
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:43,746
You saw it yourself.

39
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,165
I did.

40
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,167
So if saving that man was the right thing,

41
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,002
why did you have to apologize
for what we did?

42
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:52,088
- Why do we have to say we're sorry?
- This was our first time on the job.

43
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:55,341
Hyeon-ju wasn't there, so it's hard
for her to understand what happened.

44
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:57,302
She's still learning how we respond.

45
00:02:57,385 --> 00:02:59,512
That's why she got mad
when things didn't go as planned,

46
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:02,724
but if we apologize and take the blame,
I think she'll be cool,

47
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:04,642
and at the end,
hopefully she'll trust us more.

48
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,605
- But…
- Gun-woo.

49
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:11,733
I know you didn't do anything wrong.
I was right there with you.

50
00:03:11,816 --> 00:03:13,651
But thinking about it as a job,

51
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:17,405
a new job with a new boss,
we should try to smooth it over.

52
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:20,325
Just this once, okay?

53
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:23,912
Yeah, okay.

54
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:52,315
BLOODHOUNDS

55
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,700
Don't sit. This won't take long.

56
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,370
You fought Yang Jae-myeong, didn't you?

57
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,872
We had no choice, so… so yeah.

58
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,624
We can't work together anymore.

59
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:14,796
What? Isn't it obvious?

60
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,881
I mean, we said we were sorry.

61
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,800
I don't need an apology!

62
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:23,179
Yang Jae-myeong saw your faces, didn't he?

63
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,890
My plan was to quietly tail him…

64
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:26,808
…and gather evidence,

65
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:29,394
but now that he knows someone's on to him,
he'll probably lie low,

66
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:30,561
and who knows for long.

67
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:33,398
So, because of you, my plan is ruined.

68
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:35,858
We wore caps and masks.
He couldn't have seen our faces.

69
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:39,487
Oh! You covered your face
then there's no way he can recognize you.

70
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:42,156
Since this shitty hair was covered up,
you have an amazing disguise.

71
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,617
Goddammit! I would recognize you
from a mile away!

72
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:47,870
Well? Get out.

73
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,205
- We apologized.
- I said get out!

74
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,708
- We had no choice given the situation.
- What situation?

75
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,251
It's our first time working together.

76
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:55,211
- You can't expect perfection.
- That's why I refused you!

77
00:04:55,295 --> 00:04:57,797
- We did what we thought was right.
- What situation warrants that?

78
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,215
- I told you earlier.
- Do you not hear me?

79
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,968
- What does my hair have to do with it?
- We'll go. We'll go.

80
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:03,845
We'll leave right now,
so please stop shouting.

81
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,223
I will find a way to return

82
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:10,727
the hundred million that Mr. Choi gave me.

83
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:17,358
But… since Woo-jin and I just listened
to you yelling at us,

84
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,986
please listen to one thing I have to say.

85
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:28,828
If someone offered
to make your work go smoothly

86
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:32,332
in exchange for killing someone,

87
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,500
could you do it?

88
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,682
That boss of Smile Capital
did this to my face.

89
00:05:51,809 --> 00:05:54,395
If I had done nothing
when a man was dying in front of me,

90
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,815
then don't you think
I'd be even worse than that guy.

91
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:00,735
It would have been wrong.

92
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:04,822
Please just think about it.

93
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,859
I'll find something else.

94
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,069
Don't worry too much.

95
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:46,739
I'm sorry. I couldn't hold myself back.

96
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:49,325
You held back better than I did.

97
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:53,704
You hungry?
I know this 24-hour soup place. Let's go.

98
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:56,749
Wait.

99
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,628
It's probably closed because of COVID.
It's past ten.

100
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:05,216
Well that just made me hungry for nothing.

101
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:06,676
I forgot.

102
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,305
My stomach hurts.

103
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:15,226
Hey, it isn't my fault they're closed
because of COVID.

104
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:18,062
Well, it is your fault for bringing it up.

105
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,316
Hey, you also couldn't hold yourself back
with her.

106
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,235
You just said
I did a good job holding back.

107
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:25,570
I only said it because I felt bad.

108
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:28,448
- You were moping like a goddamn loser.
- I wasn't moping like a goddamn loser.

109
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:32,785
"I wasn't moping
like a goddamn loser."

110
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:34,912
What are you doing?

111
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:37,999
I'm imitating you, you loser.
"God, I'm hungry."

112
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:40,501
- "Oh, my stomach hurts."
- Wow.

113
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,086
Dude, that's pretty harsh.

114
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:45,882
You can't even take a joke now?

115
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:48,509
Huh? You weren't joking.
That was totally serious.

116
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:52,555
Hey, I'm seriously offended.
Apologize to me.

117
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:01,272
SORRY, I WAS WRONG. SEE YOU AT THE OFFICE
TOMORROW AT 10:00 A.M.

118
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:08,362
I knew this would happen.

119
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:54,325
Yeah! It's short. It's short. It's short.

120
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:55,409
- Super short.
- Super short!

121
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,745
- Fuck! Will you shut the fuck up?
- Get out of here, loser.

122
00:08:57,828 --> 00:09:00,373
- "Will you shut the fuck up?"
- Why are you mad? It's just a game.

123
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:01,958
- Calm down.
- It's your turn. Go!

124
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,751
- Watch it.
- Okay, I will.

125
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:05,628
- Your turn.
- Fuck off.

126
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:06,671
YANG JAE-MYEONG
I'M WAITING IN FRONT OF THE GOLF SHOP

127
00:09:06,754 --> 00:09:07,588
Stop swearing.

128
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,966
- You have to wear your mask, sir.
- Sure thing.

129
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,096
What is it?

130
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,057
Sir, someone was following us.

131
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:20,601
Who was it?

132
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,980
They were young,
but they seemed to know how to fight.

133
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:25,731
Are you sure?

134
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:26,649
Huh?

135
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:28,609
You sure someone was following you,
you idiot?!

136
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:31,487
Focus.

137
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:32,572
Uh, the thing is…

138
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:34,615
Talk.

139
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,285
Before I started working for you, sir,

140
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,869
I sort of borrowed money from a place.

141
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:41,080
The fuckers didn't say anything,
so I just ignored them.

142
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:42,248
Talk faster.

143
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:44,458
But those guys
came for the money recently.

144
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:47,545
The bastard that came over
was wearing a hat with a red cat on it.

145
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:50,840
And one of the punks who jumped us
was wearing the same hat.

146
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,011
You sure it's him?

147
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,264
It was the same hat, sir.

148
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,228
Where did you borrow the money from?

149
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,814
So basically,
this is what happened yesterday.

150
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:10,443
Yang Jae-myeong had already robbed
that homeless man of his ID,

151
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:11,611
but he had forgotten,

152
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:14,363
and he tried to con him again,
which ended up in a fight.

153
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:18,034
Uh, but just how much money

154
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:20,870
do Jae-myeong's guys borrow
with one stolen ID?

155
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:23,706
About 50 million won per fake account.

156
00:10:24,373 --> 00:10:26,167
That's 500 million for ten IDs.

157
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,419
Jesus. How long have they been doing this?

158
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:31,756
I think at least for half a year, yeah.

159
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,592
Wow! They must have made a small fortune.

160
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:36,010
Hm.

161
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:39,180
But those loan sharks that they conned,
did they just sit back and do nothing?

162
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:41,057
If they call the cops,
they'll be investigated,

163
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,308
so that's not an option.

164
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:45,019
My take is they're trying to recover
the money on their own but can't.

165
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,522
This is my plan.

166
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:51,192
Find the private loan sharks
that Yang Jae-myeong conned,

167
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:54,070
and then we recover the money he stole
for a commission.

168
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:58,157
With a 1% commission,
we would get three billion won.

169
00:10:58,824 --> 00:10:59,950
We should at least charge 2%.

170
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:07,208
Hyung?

171
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,544
If loan sharks get conned,

172
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:13,631
wouldn't that make things worse
for the people who got loans from them?

173
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,341
Huh?

174
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:18,427
They might end up torturing their clients
in order to get their money back.

175
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,221
So what?

176
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:24,392
It's just… I think small business owners
are the ones that will suffer the most.

177
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:26,977
You're right about that.

178
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:27,895
Mm.

179
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,076
How did they find us?

180
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:43,786
How did they find us?!

181
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,287
I… I don't know.

182
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,668
Turn off the lights and the sign outside.

183
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:52,461
Damn it!

184
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,758
PYEONGHWA BOOKS

185
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:00,803
- Turn your phones off for now.
- Okay.

186
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:10,438
- It's here? Are you sure?
- Yes. I'm sure, sir.

187
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:21,240
You borrowed money from a bookstore?

188
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:24,994
Yeah, the owner here used to be
a big moneylender back in the day.

189
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:43,929
Hey, give this a kick here.

190
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:54,940
Try this.

191
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,944
Come on. Hurry up, you idiot.

192
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,238
Ow.

193
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,870
- Kick harder.
- Huh?

194
00:13:07,953 --> 00:13:09,580
Kick harder, you asshole!

195
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:12,374
Uh…

196
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,334
Harder!

197
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:15,628
Harder!

198
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,296
Kick fucking harder!

199
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,844
Stop. That's enough.

200
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:26,305
We'll need something stronger
to tear this down.

201
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:30,351
This here is the safe.

202
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:13,894
Last night on your way back,
did you check if you were being followed?

203
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:17,314
Uh, well, we took the bus.

204
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:20,109
You realize
they could have followed the bus.

205
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:24,947
If they had followed us last night,
why didn't they jump us right away?

206
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,615
Why decide to make their move now?

207
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,077
- He might've wanted to bring Kim Jun-min--
- Whoa, no, Hyeon-ju.

208
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,371
Yang Jae-myeong saw
how we fought last night.

209
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:35,124
If he was planning on jumping us,
he would've brought more muscle.

210
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,419
I bet…
they weren't sure.

211
00:14:38,919 --> 00:14:42,506
But now,
they might have caught onto something.

212
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:50,472
In any case, we need to figure out
how they found out about this place.

213
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,017
That's how
we don't make the same mistake twice

214
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,643
Okay. That's a good idea.

215
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:58,230
Why don't we sit down
and talk it through, hm?

216
00:14:59,023 --> 00:14:59,857
Hm.

217
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,365
Does Yang Jae-myeong
know about this place?

218
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,492
He came here a long time ago.

219
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:16,081
That means he's caught onto
our connection here somehow.

220
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:17,958
- Oh!
- Huh?

221
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:21,545
Oh!

222
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:26,717
Uh…

223
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,137
Hyeon-ju, I think
he may have recognized your cap.

224
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,766
The thing is,

225
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:35,392
I followed you a while back

226
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:37,603
when I saw you chasing down
a homeless man.

227
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:38,771
Wait…

228
00:15:40,272 --> 00:15:42,942
Yeah, that was me.

229
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:45,778
The homeless man back then
was Yang Jae-myeong.

230
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:47,863
Oh, wow.

231
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:51,408
Uh… I was wearing
that cap back then, wasn't I?

232
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:54,745
Uh, yes,
I definitely remember seeing it on you.

233
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,499
Then that might've been
how they found out.

234
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:01,961
Okay, but why do you think
they kicked the shutters.

235
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:05,839
Our shutters were custom-made
with steel, not aluminum.

236
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,341
I think they were checking for that.

237
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:09,843
I think they'll be back.

238
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,263
Why is he here?

239
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:17,559
Damn it.

240
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,033
What have you done?

241
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:34,952
That white car came here, didn't it?

242
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:37,788
Are you not going to talk?

243
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,752
I am sorry, sir. It's entirely my fault.

244
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,798
The two of us…
We went on a job last night.

245
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:49,049
What job?

246
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,593
Uh, the thing is…

247
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:54,471
What job was that?

248
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,100
We were tailing Yang Jae-myeong.

249
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:00,477
- Why?
- Grandpa.

250
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,855
Loan sharks are desperate
to catch Yang Jae-myeong.

251
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:05,065
I'm sure they'll be willing to pay for it.

252
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:08,235
And I believe I'm the only one
who is able to catch him.

253
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,487
Are you doing this to make money?

254
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,322
It's good to make money.

255
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:15,451
And what did you guys do?

256
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:19,121
It's my… friends' job
to protect me, right?

257
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,498
Well, they did.

258
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,293
I'm disappointed in you.

259
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:28,255
Yeah, well,
I'm disappointed in you too, Grandpa.

260
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:30,466
It's clear Yang Jae-myeong
is up to no good,

261
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,925
so why aren't you doing anything?

262
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:35,471
With your orders, Mr. Hwang could
get rid of a loser like him immediately.

263
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:38,432
So you're frustrated?
Well, I'm even more frustrated!

264
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,603
Go ahead.
Take off that bandage on your face.

265
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:44,438
- Hm?
- Hurry up and do it.

266
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,864
If Yang Jae-myeong and Kim Jun-min
keep scamming private loan sharks,

267
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:58,702
they'll keep threatening and harassing
powerless people like Gun-woo here.

268
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:03,123
That's going to make
all the charity work you do meaningless.

269
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:06,085
Your money will go straight
into their pockets!

270
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:09,338
If you really want
to help out those in need,

271
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:12,549
you should weed out the punks
like Yang Jae-myeong first.

272
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:16,095
Who did that to Gun-woo's face?

273
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:20,557
The boss of Smile Capital did it, sir.

274
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:22,935
And his name?

275
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:26,105
Uh, well, I don't know his name, sir.

276
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:29,733
But he had a long knife scar
running down his left cheek.

277
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:39,993
You guys head back now.

278
00:18:57,719 --> 00:19:01,598
Sir, could it just be a coincidence?

279
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:05,477
Please check whether Kim Myeong-gil
is the CEO of Smile Capital.

280
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:06,812
Yes, sir.

281
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:16,238
Juju.

282
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:20,617
- Getting too comfortable, aren't we?
- I mean, you called us friends before.

283
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,870
I have to say, that felt good.

284
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,371
So?

285
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:27,916
So I thought it might be nice
to talk more casually with each other.

286
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,002
We are a team, after all, Juju.

287
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:32,629
Hm, we're not a team
if we don't speak casually?

288
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:34,089
I'm just saying it would be nice

289
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:35,799
if we acted more
like one big happy family.

290
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,134
It's just a suggestion.

291
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:40,888
Well, if we're family,
the oldest would treat the rest to a meal.

292
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:42,097
So will you be buying?

293
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:45,017
Uh, I actually prefer formalities, ma'am.

294
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,768
I'm kidding. Relax.

295
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,104
Let's use Grandpa's credit card.
What do you guys want?

296
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,022
Rib eye.

297
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:51,565
Then you pay.

298
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,276
Uh, barbecue buffet.

299
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:57,446
- A barbecue buffet?
- Yeah, I know a really great place.

300
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,576
Mm, sure.

301
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:03,493
Let's go!

302
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,999
How long have you been friends
with Gun-woo?

303
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:13,253
I don't think it really matters
how long you've known a person.

304
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:16,089
Just knowing someone for a while
doesn't mean they're your friend.

305
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:17,007
Okay.

306
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:21,762
What really matters is how similar
your life trajectories have been.

307
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:23,764
So even if it's a short conversation,

308
00:20:23,847 --> 00:20:25,849
you gain a deep understanding
of each other.

309
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:27,392
That's what matters.

310
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,645
- That's the relationship you guys have?
- Right.

311
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,521
It's like we're boxers,

312
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:34,399
but we exchange a lot more
than just our fists. Pow!

313
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:36,985
"So that's the kind of life you've lived."

314
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:37,903
Pow!

315
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:39,529
"Well, this is how I lived, you punk."

316
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:45,285
Each blow contains
both fighters' character, heart,

317
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:48,497
history, history,

318
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,123
History?

319
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:51,917
History.

320
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,711
We see it all.

321
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:55,879
We know. Mm.

322
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:57,589
Sure.

323
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,549
And besides, Gun-woo is…

324
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:02,886
a senior Marine.

325
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:06,014
And that tells you everything.

326
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:08,225
What exactly does it tell you?

327
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:11,144
Everything.

328
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:12,437
Everything about what?

329
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:15,607
Juju, this isn't something
I just can't easily explain to you.

330
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,317
It's just, you know, a Marine thing.

331
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:21,238
It's like when rappers use hip-hop
as an all-encompassing term

332
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:23,657
when they look at something
and go, "This is hip-hop."

333
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,284
It's indescribable.

334
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:27,911
Oh, indescribable, you say?

335
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:30,998
- Are you being sarcastic?
- Who? Me?

336
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,416
Hey, this stuff is really…

337
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:33,625
- Here we go.
- Right.

338
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:38,672
Huh?

339
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,925
Dude,
you haven't turned on the grill yet?

340
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:43,176
You didn't tell me to.

341
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,971
Come on, man. Whoever is sitting down
is supposed to get the grill going.

342
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:48,348
I didn't know that.
Why didn't you turn it when we got here?

343
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:51,518
Because the grill would've burned up
in the time it took to return with meat.

344
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:53,312
How would a grill burn up?

345
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:56,648
Well, technically,
the grill itself doesn't burn.

346
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,942
The meat would burn
the second you place it on the grill.

347
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,152
You're talking about meat burning?

348
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:02,446
That's what people mean
when they say they're burning the grill.

349
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:05,741
Well, that's insider lingo for people
who work at barbecue restaurants.

350
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,743
My mom also refers to it
as "burning the grill."

351
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,703
Well, my mom doesn't.

352
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:12,080
- For someone who knows meat--
- There!

353
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:13,707
Get grilling.

354
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,167
Uh, no.

355
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,128
It's too soon for the meat.
Can't put it on a lukewarm grill.

356
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:19,838
That would ruin the flavor.
You gotta wait.

357
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,177
Shall we maybe converse
while the grill is heating up?

358
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:29,514
Gun-woo, just speak naturally for once.

359
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,391
Uh, so are you and Mr. Choi related?

360
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:34,603
Huh? Well, that came out of left field.

361
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,146
I've wanted to know too.

362
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:37,898
Since the very beginning, Juju.

363
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:40,650
Well…

364
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,487
…long story short…

365
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:48,533
I was diagnosed with spinal cancer
when I was eight.

366
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,495
I was cured by the time I was ten,

367
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:55,999
but then… my dad died.

368
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:59,795
So I was sent to an orphanage,

369
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:03,131
I hated it so much that I ran away.

370
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:06,093
I used to get so hungry, you know,

371
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:10,722
that I ate leftover jjajangmyeon
that people left on their doorstep.

372
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:13,725
I also worked at bars
with other runaway kids,

373
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:16,603
but I couldn't do it anymore.

374
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:20,023
So I returned to the orphanage.

375
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:25,529
But I was then dragged off
to a different orphanage when I was 17.

376
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:28,365
And Grandpa happened to be
the owner there.

377
00:23:28,448 --> 00:23:30,325
- You mean Mr. Choi?
- Yes.

378
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:34,204
He said he built an orphanage
because he wanted to do something good.

379
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:38,166
He was really nice to me in particular.

380
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:40,752
So at first,
I thought he might be a pervert, but…

381
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,256
I came to know as time passed…

382
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,093
that he was being sincere.

383
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:50,720
Grandpa paid for me
to learn everything I know now.

384
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:52,264
because I didn't have the money.

385
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:56,101
I learned kendo, how to ride a motorcycle.

386
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:04,776
I could tell immediately
that Mr. Choi is really a nice person.

387
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:06,778
Since middle school,

388
00:24:06,862 --> 00:24:09,906
I've been working part-time jobs
to pay off my dad's debt.

389
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,659
But when our debt got to 100 million won,

390
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:14,411
I suddenly felt totally helpless.

391
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:18,206
So I know how scary
a hundred million won can be.

392
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:21,877
And when Mr. Choi gave me that money,
telling me to pay off my debts,

393
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,211
I thought to myself,

394
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,923
I have to make sure to protect this man
at all costs.

395
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:32,762
Grandpa told me that
in order to judge someone's character,

396
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:34,431
one should open up your heart.

397
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:37,058
That people with character
will see your sincerity

398
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,143
and return it in kind,

399
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:41,354
and those who lack depth
will try to use that against you.

400
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:44,608
- Agreed.
- You're a nice person, Gun-woo.

401
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:49,154
Thanks. Two things I'm good at
are being nice and being diligent.

402
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:51,656
- I think we can start grilling now.
- Mm-hm.

403
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:00,499
Ah!

404
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:04,127
- Ah, perfect timing. Very nice.
- You're getting pretty good at this.

405
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:06,338
Well, I mean,
I learned from the best, right?

406
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:09,424
Wow, I'm feeling so left out
all of a sudden.

407
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,801
Sheesh, never mind.

408
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:12,719
Hurry up and flip it.

409
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:15,180
- I can't do that yet.
- You gotta trust him. He's good at this.

410
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:17,933
Sorry,
I didn't know he was the grill master.

411
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:19,142
You will soon.

412
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:23,063
Smells amazing!

413
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:24,814
Oh!

414
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:26,358
Let's clean out the buffet.

415
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:27,442
Sure.

416
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:30,195
- When are those stitches coming off?
- Tomorrow morning.

417
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:31,279
Does it hurt?

418
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:32,864
Not too bad.

419
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:37,118
- I asked for mine hot.
- You're supposed to take your coffee cold.

420
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:38,912
Seriously? Come on.

421
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:40,705
- Hyeon-ju.
- Yeah?

422
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:42,624
Yang Jae-myeong knows
where the bookstore is.

423
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:44,251
Shouldn't we do something about it?

424
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,629
I'll talk it over with Grandpa.

425
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:50,840
You should ask him soon.
We don't have time.

426
00:25:50,924 --> 00:25:51,758
Okay.

427
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:54,594
Ms. Lee.

428
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:57,347
The lobby is a hotel's first impression.

429
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,182
I want us to impress
our international guests

430
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:01,434
with the most beautiful,
stunning Korean experience

431
00:26:01,518 --> 00:26:02,519
they've ever encountered.

432
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:04,354
Something
they've never experienced before.

433
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:05,397
That kind of thing.

434
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,690
Yes, I understand.

435
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:07,816
TEAM LEADER LEE SO-HYEON

436
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:10,610
Anyway, I look forward to hearing
your brilliant ideas.

437
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:12,070
See you tomorrow morning.

438
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:14,614
Our casino will be
on the top floor of that hotel.

439
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:19,119
My goal is a hundred billion
in annual revenue.

440
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:20,829
There are a lot of people
itching for a fix

441
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:24,207
now that gambling in Macau
has been blocked off due to COVID.

442
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:29,254
We'll secretly book them a suite
every week and let them have fun

443
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,674
while secretly catching their gambling
on camera.

444
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:35,468
Afterward, once we have enough cash,

445
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:39,639
Jang-do will make sure
to hand over to the police

446
00:26:40,307 --> 00:26:41,850
all evidence of gambling.

447
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:46,104
When the hotel is ruined
and worth nothing,

448
00:26:47,063 --> 00:26:50,900
we'll swoop in
and take over the whole thing.

449
00:26:57,699 --> 00:27:00,035
We need to be ready
to spend a hundred billion

450
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:02,829
by the time Jang-do returns
with dirt on Director Hong.

451
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:06,082
We're 50 billion short, right?

452
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,000
Yes.

453
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,670
Now it's time to collect on everything.

454
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,382
Sell off anything that's of any value.

455
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:17,510
Coming through!

456
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,268
Yes, sir.

457
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:27,854
Yes, that car you mentioned before
just came in.

458
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:29,105
Cool.

459
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,858
I'll be right back, sir.

460
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:44,996
What the…

461
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,170
CAR WASH EXIT
NO PARKING

462
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,214
Hello!

463
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:58,093
Damn it.

464
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:15,276
All right, keep him down.

465
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:20,031
Look at him!

466
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:27,497
You want more, huh?

467
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:30,250
Grab him.

468
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,257
Hey, strip him down.

469
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:47,267
Ah.

470
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:49,769
- He's this way.
- Is he in there now?

471
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:51,730
- Yes.
- Thank you for your hard work.

472
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:56,109
- You can count it.
- Thank you, sir.

473
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:58,361
Look at him.

474
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:03,700
Hey. Hey, shh.

475
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:05,702
Whoa!
You boys sure did a number on him.

476
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:06,995
- Hello, sir!
- Hello, sir!

477
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:08,121
I'm so cold.

478
00:29:08,204 --> 00:29:10,498
Can I please have
something to wear? Please.

479
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:11,624
God, I'm… I'm sorry, sir.

480
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:17,422
Hi there.

481
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:23,636
You…

482
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,847
You, it's you, isn't it? Fuck.

483
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,098
Motherfucker!

484
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:31,227
Jesus, not too long ago,
you were acting like hot shit.

485
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:33,438
Prick.

486
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:34,939
So,

487
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:38,610
you really shouldn't have fucked around
with him.

488
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:41,404
Did you think he would get scared

489
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:46,201
and apologize to you or something
just because your cousin's a cop? Huh?

490
00:29:54,918 --> 00:29:58,755
Listen, let me teach you a little lesson.

491
00:29:58,838 --> 00:30:02,842
Wild animals bite back if you hit them.

492
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:07,972
It doesn't matter how much stronger
or weaker you are than them.

493
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:10,308
They just bite back.

494
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:20,276
Now then.

495
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:24,197
Strip down.

496
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,448
What?

497
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:27,742
Come on, take everything off,
including your underwear.

498
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:31,496
No, I get it now.
Please, just this once.

499
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:33,081
- Ugh.
- I'm sorry.

500
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:35,500
I really don't know what this is about,
but I'm really sorry.

501
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:36,459
Hey, In-beom.

502
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:38,670
Please, just this once.

503
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:44,509
Wrap it up.

504
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,688
Are you stripping or not?

505
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:00,108
Don't kill me.

506
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,444
I guess you're still thirsty.

507
00:31:06,781 --> 00:31:09,033
- Oh!
- What's it gonna be?

508
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:20,128
- Well…
- I'll strip down! I'll strip down!

509
00:31:26,843 --> 00:31:28,303
Good call.

510
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:30,346
Now then, Director Hong,
without further ado,

511
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:31,556
let's see you strip.

512
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,491
I GOT SOMETHING BIG

513
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,660
All right, that's enough.

514
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:29,864
Yes.

515
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,699
Uh, Mr. Choi,

516
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:35,995
the Kim Myeong-gil we know
is indeed the CEO of Smile Capital.

517
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:38,039
Yes, I understand.

518
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:41,542
I'm coming to pick you up.
I'll be there soon, sir.

519
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:43,795
Yes.

520
00:33:04,691 --> 00:33:06,484
I apologize for my sudden decision.

521
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:12,281
Recently, I've gone through
something very difficult for me.

522
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:16,703
And I came to this conclusion
after thinking things over,

523
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:18,204
so I hope you'll understand.

524
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:21,791
Our company will be terminated
by the end of the month.

525
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:25,044
I will be wiring you

526
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:28,339
all of your salary
as well as your severance pay.

527
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:33,553
Thanks for everything.

528
00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:39,600
Sir, what about… all of our money
that's out there right now?

529
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:41,811
I'm gonna take care of it.

530
00:34:08,671 --> 00:34:10,465
Papa!

531
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:33,821
- Yes.
- This is Oh In-muk in security, sir.

532
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:36,449
Some robbers have broken into your office.

533
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:38,326
How many?

534
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:45,166
I think there are two.

535
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:11,692
Hey!

536
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:14,362
What's taking you so long?

537
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:18,449
This model normally comes
with a six-digit combination.

538
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:19,492
This one has eight.

539
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:20,952
I think they modified it.

540
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:24,580
- What does that mean?
- Gonna need more time.

541
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:26,332
Hurry it up.

542
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:51,899
Got it!

543
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:54,735
Out of the way.

544
00:36:03,494 --> 00:36:04,745
PRIVATE LOAN STANDARD AGREEMENT

545
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:08,040
These promissory notes
are worth a billion won a pop.

546
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:09,083
Fuck!

547
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:30,605
No one has come out.
I also held the elevator here.

548
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:31,856
Thank you.

549
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,234
Uh, shall I accompany you?

550
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:38,154
Oh, no. I'll be fine. Thank you very much.

551
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:41,073
Uh, let me just borrow this.

552
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:41,991
Sure.

553
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:18,945
Who are you?

554
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,116
How did you get in?

555
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,673
Who sent you?

556
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:29,181
Who sent you?

557
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:32,393
Who sent you?

558
00:38:35,646 --> 00:38:36,814
Who sent you?

559
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:39,734
Who sent you?

560
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:01,255
Fuck.

561
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:35,349
Sir, are you okay?

562
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:36,684
Kill that fucker!

563
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:27,067
It's okay, Beom. Huh?

564
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:29,153
- Snap out of it. You're okay.
- Okay.

565
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:30,488
Yes, sir.

566
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:32,114
- Kang In-beom!
- Yes, sir!

567
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:35,159
We don't have time.

568
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:38,204
Take all the money in the safe
and head down first, okay?

569
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:45,127
Calm down. Calm down.

570
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:16,575
Huh?

571
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:18,202
Sir!

572
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:20,788
He's not there!

573
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,461
- Just go downstairs.
- Yes, sir.

574
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:50,901
- Mr. Choi.
- Hm?

575
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:22,600
Have you thought about it yet?

576
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:28,314
What's the problem?

577
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:31,191
Let's avoid Yang Jae-myeong.

578
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:32,943
Why?

579
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:35,613
Those people also resort to killing.

580
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:37,573
I want to move the bookstore as well.

581
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:39,199
Why?

582
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:40,242
Hyeon-ju.

583
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:44,455
Look at me.

584
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:50,544
I am old and tired.

585
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:53,339
There's no strength or courage left in me

586
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:55,674
to fight them.

587
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:58,802
I just want to live
my remaining days in peace,

588
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:01,639
teaching you the things
I want to teach you,

589
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:04,475
and giving you all the things that…

590
00:44:06,518 --> 00:44:09,188
that I want to leave to you
once I'm not here anymore.

591
00:44:11,106 --> 00:44:13,108
That is the only thing I want right now.

592
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:19,865
Do you understand what I'm saying?

593
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:26,622
Good.

594
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:29,041
And thank you.

595
00:45:52,291 --> 00:45:54,126
Remember, the value of gold rises

596
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:58,797
every single time people lose confidence
in fiat currency.

597
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:01,216
You gotta your slush fund in gold.

598
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:05,429
Besides, if you melt the gold down
and mix it with other gold,

599
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:06,597
it launders itself.

600
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:10,309
That was the very first thing I learned
when I worked for Choi.

601
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:16,482
Failing to get my hands
on his hidden gold…

602
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:20,778
is something that I still regret.

603
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:23,030
That old stupid fuck.

604
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:27,576
He suddenly grows a conscience
and closes down the damn company.

605
00:47:20,045 --> 00:47:22,130
- Beom.
- Yes, sir.

606
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:24,049
Get in here.

607
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:36,353
What do you think?

608
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:38,480
It's amazing.

609
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:45,612
Each bar is worth 500 million.

610
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:47,531
If our business in Korea goes south,

611
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:51,702
you and I will take all this gold
and go to Vietnam.

612
00:47:51,785 --> 00:47:52,828
Huh?

613
00:47:52,911 --> 00:47:53,996
We can hide there.

614
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:56,582
I planted someone
in the Vietnamese government.

615
00:47:57,958 --> 00:47:58,792
Thanks to this,

616
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:03,422
we should be able to live like kings
for the rest of our days.

617
00:48:05,757 --> 00:48:06,717
Thank you, sir. I…

618
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:13,473
You're a brother to me.

619
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:15,684
I would do anything for you.

620
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:18,270
Beom, listen.

621
00:48:20,814 --> 00:48:23,901
Out here, you are all I've got.

622
00:48:25,485 --> 00:48:26,570
You know that, right?

623
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:28,488
Mm-hm.

624
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:36,371
Come on.

625
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:38,749
It's the best
stir-fried spicy pork in the world.

626
00:48:38,832 --> 00:48:40,500
- It's that good?
- Yeah.

627
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:51,929
Auntie? Auntie!

628
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:55,766
Auntie. Auntie.

629
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:58,143
It's okay. It's okay. It's me, Woo-jin.

630
00:48:58,226 --> 00:49:01,271
Oh God, Woo-jin.
Woo-jin, Woo-jin.

631
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:03,273
What happened?

632
00:49:04,149 --> 00:49:06,735
I… I took out a private loan.

633
00:49:07,444 --> 00:49:08,946
They told me to pay them back.

634
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:12,491
I told them I had no money
because I didn't get any customers today.

635
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:14,952
And they smashed everything.

636
00:49:15,035 --> 00:49:17,663
God, I'm scared. I'm so scared.

637
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:20,540
What do I do?

638
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:29,174
How is she supposed to
operate her business if you smash it up?

639
00:49:29,257 --> 00:49:31,051
How do you expect her to pay you back now?

640
00:49:31,551 --> 00:49:33,303
She wasn't paying.
What should I do?

641
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:35,681
You should ease up on them.
Everyone's having a tough time.

642
00:49:35,764 --> 00:49:37,724
And how am I supposed to make a living?

643
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:39,893
You know what, why don't you pay for her?

644
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:43,480
Come on,
you know I don't have the money for that.

645
00:49:43,563 --> 00:49:45,190
Then just shut your goddamn mouth.

646
00:49:45,273 --> 00:49:47,067
And mind your own fucking business.

647
00:49:47,859 --> 00:49:49,695
- Got it?
- Fine.

648
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:00,205
It's Im.

649
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:03,125
I worked with him back in the day.

650
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:06,086
Apparently, he just got conned
by someone he lent 500 million to.

651
00:50:06,169 --> 00:50:08,005
- Is Yang Jae-myeong involved?
- I don't know.

652
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:10,215
I didn't ask for the details.

653
00:50:10,298 --> 00:50:13,510
But it was a homeless person's ID
that they used to open a fake account.

654
00:50:13,593 --> 00:50:14,511
Identical MO.

655
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:16,054
It's him.

656
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:18,390
I say we should catch him.

657
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,519
I can't just stand by
and do nothing about it.

658
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:24,938
Grandpa told us to lie low.

659
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:27,190
That they're really dangerous.

660
00:50:27,274 --> 00:50:29,526
But I think it's wrong to do nothing
after seeing all that.

661
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:32,446
What if I call him back
and tip him off about Yang Jae-myeong,

662
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:33,613
so he can catch him himself.

663
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:36,867
If the goal is to capture him,
we should do it.

664
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:38,577
Maybe we could make some money.

665
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:42,289
If we do make money from this,
can I use it to help out Auntie?

666
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:45,375
If we do, we'll split it evenly.
Feel free to use it however you see fit.

667
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:49,254
- Cool.
- Then I want to help her too.

668
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:54,009
Come here.

669
00:50:57,763 --> 00:50:59,514
- Come on over.
- No.

670
00:51:02,642 --> 00:51:03,560
Thank you.

671
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:18,867
All in.

672
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:34,424
Sir, you should look at this.

673
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:38,386
That car over there.

674
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:41,890
They cut the engine,
but no one's getting out.

675
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:46,144
- Hey, get ready.
- Yes, sir.

676
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:48,855
Hey, check your phone.

677
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:50,065
- Yes, sir.
- Okay, okay.

678
00:51:56,822 --> 00:51:58,198
Hey, sir, they're here.

679
00:51:58,698 --> 00:52:02,035
In exactly two hours, make your move.

680
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:27,102
They're here.

681
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:36,486
Let's go. Let's go.

682
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:44,578
You're gonna die today, you dumb fucks.

683
00:53:50,268 --> 00:53:51,144
Yes, sir.

684
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:53,313
Come down now.

685
00:54:03,448 --> 00:54:04,532
Come out!

686
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:08,954
Hey, you fuckers, I know you're there,
so hurry up and show yourselves.

687
00:54:09,037 --> 00:54:11,790
Come out, assholes!
What is this, hide-and-seek?

688
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:13,500
Motherfuckers.

689
00:54:27,764 --> 00:54:28,598
Please pick up…

690
00:54:29,391 --> 00:54:30,225
Please.

691
00:54:30,308 --> 00:54:32,185
HYEON-JU

692
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:38,566
- Mm?
- Grandpa.

693
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:40,026
Woo-jin and Gun-woo are in danger.

694
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:42,195
Where are you?

695
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:44,489
- Get a move on.
- Let's go! Let's go!

696
00:54:44,572 --> 00:54:45,991
You sons of bitches!

697
00:54:46,074 --> 00:54:48,243
- Let's get 'em.
- Fuck.

698
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:52,038
- Get a move on.
