1
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:16,933
Go!

2
00:00:22,814 --> 00:00:23,773
Whoa!

3
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,755
Stop!

4
00:00:51,092 --> 00:00:52,010
Damn it!

5
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:53,428
Drop the bag!

6
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:55,513
Oh, shit!

7
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:58,516
Come here!

8
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:00,852
Start the car!

9
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:04,647
Hurry up! Hurry. Run faster.

10
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:10,195
Hurry, hurry! Come on!

11
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:13,198
Start the car!

12
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:17,202
- Bastards.
- Run faster!

13
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:18,536
Hurry!

14
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,498
Please hurry up.

15
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:24,793
Come on. Door. Door. Door.
Come on, let's go!

16
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:37,263
God dammit.

17
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:04,249
BLOODHOUNDS

18
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:08,837
People borrowing from Kim Myeong-gil
is way more than we thought.

19
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:12,340
They all enter the bar
in one-hour intervals.

20
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:15,426
Some of them in official police vehicles.

21
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:18,388
I don't know his name,

22
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,474
but there was also
a professional baseball player.

23
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:27,105
Yeah, well, seems he's expanded his reach.

24
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:48,960
I knew it
that Myeong-gil was an ex-convict.

25
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:51,504
He begged for my help.

26
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,756
He said all he wanted was a fresh start.

27
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,759
And like an idiot…

28
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,930
I fell for it.

29
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,143
After Myeong-gil screwed me,

30
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:08,521
I went into hiding with Mr. Oh.

31
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,192
That's when I heard rumors
that he'd started a company

32
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:15,236
using the money and bonds
he had stolen from me.

33
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,782
I should've taken care of him
a long time ago.

34
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,785
I taught him everything.

35
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,250
I didn't have the courage.

36
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:33,171
I wish I would've gained some by now.

37
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,634
I shouldn't have stopped you
from going after him

38
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,344
and giving him what he deserved.

39
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:41,304
I'm sorry.

40
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:45,558
I was too afraid I'd lose you as well.

41
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:53,816
You've always…

42
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:58,321
cared for me and protected me
like I was family.

43
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:02,158
I'm always…

44
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:06,120
…ready to lay my life on the line for you
anytime you need it, sir.

45
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,414
I know you are.

46
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:11,542
And I'm sorry.

47
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:21,678
Hello.

48
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,223
Okay.

49
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:27,684
Come on back.

50
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:35,024
So, uh, it seems the kids just got jumped

51
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,527
while they were moving all the money.

52
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:40,571
- Are they hurt?
- No, they didn't mention it.

53
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:42,073
But, uh,

54
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,576
they said they lost the money
from the safe.

55
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,287
Are they hurt or not?

56
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,622
I think they're all right.

57
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:57,463
They also… tied one of them up
but didn't want to finish him off.

58
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:58,506
Now what?

59
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:03,761
When an ER receives a patient
that was injured doing something illegal…

60
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:07,223
…the doctors are obligated
to call the police.

61
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:10,685
That's why
I used to have surgeons of my own

62
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:12,353
ready to operate at all times.

63
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:16,399
I'm pretty sure Myeong-gil must have
a similar arrangement.

64
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,652
I'll go get Du-yeong.
He's gonna find him fast.

65
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:12,622
Good job.

66
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:14,999
Hey.

67
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:19,837
Good job.

68
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:21,631
Uh, yeah.

69
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:26,219
Get some sleep, okay?
Come to the restaurant tomorrow.

70
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:29,389
What? Uh, what for?

71
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:31,182
For food.

72
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:33,476
Oh.

73
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:36,437
Okay?

74
00:06:37,855 --> 00:06:39,399
I don't usually eat lunch.

75
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:40,942
- You will.
- Yeah.

76
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,319
Go on.

77
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,537
Hey.

78
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:58,793
You okay?

79
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:03,840
We lost all the money
in the safe. I'm really sorry.

80
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:05,800
But you're not hurt anywhere, right?

81
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:07,301
Oh.

82
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,262
No.

83
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:11,806
That's all that matters.

84
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:17,270
Oh. I… I have more boxes to move.
You should sleep.

85
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:24,026
Hyeong-ju, are you sure you're not hurt?

86
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:28,865
Yeah.

87
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,880
It's not that I didn't pay them back,
but this guy just came in…

88
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:29,592
In-beom is going to be fine,

89
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,511
but his eardrum is busted.

90
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:35,723
I got a license plate.
I'll run it through tomorrow.

91
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:37,975
What do you mean "tomorrow"?

92
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:41,604
That's when
the officers we pay are on duty.

93
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,608
Watch your tone with me.

94
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,111
Don't push me.

95
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:50,905
Ah, shit.

96
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:01,457
If it's an unregistered vehicle
or fake plates,

97
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,794
is it possible to track it
with the security cameras?

98
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:08,798
It's definitely possible,
but it would take us a little while.

99
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:12,260
License plates can be looked up
on the police Intranet.

100
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:14,845
But if we're talking about
getting security footage,

101
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:18,808
that's a different story. We'd have to…
be able to get inside control centers,

102
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,977
and I would need to pay off
the right kinds of people.

103
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,020
Money is not an issue.

104
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:24,939
Just get it done quickly.

105
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:26,607
Yes.

106
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:29,193
I want you to find out
who owns the building.

107
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:32,655
If it's Choi,
you need to get his home address.

108
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:34,365
Yeah.

109
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:35,533
You can go now.

110
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,618
Let me talk to Jang-do.

111
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:40,037
Sir?

112
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:43,457
You heard me.

113
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:48,421
Sure.

114
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:10,276
Beom,

115
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:12,737
why do you think they left him there?

116
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:16,282
Is it because they had run out of time?

117
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,160
Jang-do. Jang-do, huh?

118
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:22,496
You're thinking far too positively
right now.

119
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:25,458
Think negatively for a change.

120
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,585
Try to understand.

121
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,170
Those bastards are trying to kill you.

122
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:32,048
You should allow that idea
to drive your thoughts.

123
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,549
So why'd they leave him there?

124
00:10:36,385 --> 00:10:38,387
They're planning to track him.

125
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,016
Okay then.

126
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:44,769
We need to get more men
and put them at the hospital.

127
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:46,437
Yes.

128
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:49,857
And we need to follow Jun-min.

129
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:54,028
Why? Did he do something wrong?

130
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:57,281
Uh, I told you to think negatively
about this.

131
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:00,785
Mr. Choi may have info on him.

132
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,663
Ah.

133
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,208
Jun-min is just a coward.

134
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,502
He's turned way too easily.

135
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,295
It'll be very obvious.

136
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,923
One look at his face,
and he just gives everything away, huh?

137
00:11:15,257 --> 00:11:16,092
Sir.

138
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,053
All right now.

139
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:21,597
Beom is just a small fry here.

140
00:11:22,598 --> 00:11:23,891
So Lee Du-yeong is our man.

141
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:25,226
He's got a bike.

142
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:27,186
That's who they'll send to tail him.

143
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:28,104
Yeah.

144
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,648
Block the streets and trap him.

145
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,068
Yes.

146
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,821
Should be fun.

147
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,222
Oh!

148
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,099
Did you sleep well, sir?

149
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,059
Did you get any sleep?

150
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:08,644
Yeah.

151
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:11,105
You got back so late. You should rest now.

152
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:12,857
I got plenty of sleep, but thank you.

153
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,024
Ah, Gun-woo,

154
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:16,277
I've been meaning
to talk to you, actually.

155
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,194
Oh.

156
00:12:22,324 --> 00:12:27,705
Hyeon-ju, uh… You may have noticed
she always has a bit of an edge to here.

157
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:28,622
Oh.

158
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:33,085
I think that's the reason why
she acts a little cold at times.

159
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,421
Ah.

160
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:38,632
But she seems
to have softened considerably

161
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:39,884
since meeting you and Woo-jin.

162
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:42,470
For that, you have my gratitude.

163
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:45,556
We really enjoyed working with Hyeon-ju.

164
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,057
Oh, very good.

165
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:49,143
So, the money I paid you in advance,

166
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:51,020
it's gone.

167
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:55,775
Oh, so… where did the money go then?

168
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:58,068
I meant to say that we're even now.

169
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,612
Oh, why?

170
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:03,741
Do you have any idea
how much money you managed to recover?

171
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:05,743
Uh, well…

172
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:14,668
I'm going to give you a nice bonus
for a safe transport.

173
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,170
Oh, uh…

174
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:19,548
I'd like to pay it back
by putting my fair share of work, sir.

175
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,383
You've already done your share.

176
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,845
You three managed
to retrieve a considerable sum.

177
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:31,352
So from this moment,
you're not indebted to me anymore.

178
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:36,440
Get your mom
and go open a new café somewhere nice.

179
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,152
I'll make all the necessary investments.

180
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,866
Thank you so much, Mr. Choi.

181
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:49,537
I want to help you catch Kim Myeong-gil

182
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:52,081
I'll do that until the very end.

183
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,707
You've been very helpful.

184
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,418
I know that,
but I'd like to see it to the very end.

185
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,754
Why?

186
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,965
To repay my debt.

187
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,008
You've done enough already.

188
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,718
It's not enough in my book, sir.

189
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:08,097
It's not over until it's over for real.

190
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:12,434
Yeah.

191
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,523
It's not over till it's over for real.

192
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:19,859
We should have a drink sometime soon.

193
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:22,945
Oh, I don't really drink, unfortunately.

194
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:24,530
Huh.

195
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:26,532
I'll be more than happy
to pour your drinks, sir.

196
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:32,872
- Go on.
- Oh, okay.

197
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,900
Use wasabi and soy sauce.

198
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:08,407
Mm.

199
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:23,005
Wild caught.

200
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:28,886
You see, farmed halibut have a lot of fat
in their fins that can be too heavy.

201
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:33,474
But wild ones like this
have all that fat evenly distributed.

202
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:38,354
It's such a clean and exquisite flavor.

203
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,190
I can still taste it.

204
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,150
And it's aged to perfection.

205
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:44,777
Huh.

206
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:47,821
You? An expert?

207
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,531
Oh…

208
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,575
I was a restaurant YouTuber
back in the day,

209
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:54,328
but my channel
didn't get enough subscribers, so I quit.

210
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:57,039
This was my first time having it cut long.

211
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,792
It wraps around your mouth like a whip.

212
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:03,671
That was the best halibut
I've ever had, sir.

213
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:05,547
Love it.

214
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,258
That was amazing.

215
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:10,636
Hey, I'm a hustler.

216
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:11,929
I'll subscribe.

217
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:13,722
- I told you it's over.
- Oh.

218
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:15,766
You kids went through a lot.

219
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,060
That's why I wanted to treat you.

220
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,603
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

221
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,271
What do you plan to do now?

222
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:23,357
Well, kill the big guy.

223
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,027
Then catch the one
that looks like a wildcat.

224
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:29,822
That one is Kim Myeong-gil's cleanup crew.

225
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:35,035
He's the one they send around
buying people's silence

226
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,621
and threatening their lives
whenever it's needed.

227
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:39,665
We'll fuck him up.

228
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:43,043
And then he's going to lead us
to where the bodies are buried.

229
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,170
Then we'll have Kim Myeong-gil.

230
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:47,756
- Then Smile Capital is over.
- That's right.

231
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,635
Well, what do we do
if we don't find any bodies?

232
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:55,764
Well, we can find a murder weapon
or maybe some security footage.

233
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:58,600
Here.

234
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:01,937
As for the yellowtail,

235
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,231
the age--

236
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:05,357
Oh, sorry I'm late.

237
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:08,610
- Sit, sit. Sit, sit.
- Took your time.

238
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:11,488
Lee Du-yeong.
Nice to meet you. Pound this.

239
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:12,990
- Kim Gun-woo, sir.
- Uh-huh.

240
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:17,494
- Hong Woo-jin.
- Oh, boxer fists. Hello.

241
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:20,164
I went to the underpass that day.

242
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:23,500
I went over there
as soon as your grandfather called me,

243
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:24,710
but I got there late.

244
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:28,839
Then I saw those goons
lying on the ground and thought,

245
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:30,090
"These guys can fight."

246
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:35,679
Remember when you wanted
to be a boxing champion back then?

247
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:38,766
- That was a long time ago.
- What is it?

248
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:41,351
We got a hit.

249
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:43,937
Who?

250
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,355
The sales director.

251
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:47,066
Let's talk in the back.

252
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:49,443
What? Why? They're coming with us.

253
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:51,487
What are you talking about?

254
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:54,740
- What's the problem?
- It'll make them all accomplices.

255
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,702
Hey, they're the ones who wanted in.

256
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:06,168
Listen, once you have a record,
boxing days are over. Got it?

257
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:08,003
Yeah.

258
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:13,008
Why are you fighting Kim Myeong-gil,
Mr. Hwang?

259
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,344
I'm here to finally avenge our boys.

260
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:16,970
But you could die fighting him.

261
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:18,764
Aren't you… afraid?

262
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:23,060
What I'm really afraid of
is not managing to kill the fucker.

263
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:26,730
Okay, and what about you two?

264
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:28,690
- I'm in.
- Me too.

265
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:29,817
Why?

266
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,569
Because Kim Myeong-gil is a bad man.

267
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:36,657
My family would have been ruined
without the help of Mr. Choi.

268
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:38,909
I'm only good at fighting,

269
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,079
so I'll help however I can.

270
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:43,872
Same here.

271
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,458
These two Marines,
they're ready for your assistance, sir.

272
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:47,918
You two are Marines?

273
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:48,836
Yes.

274
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:50,379
Are you a Marine?

275
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:51,922
Exempted, but he was.

276
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,758
Oh!

277
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:56,760
Salute!

278
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:04,560
Hey, can you stop telling everyone
my personal shit, man?

279
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,770
This is how you get to know people.

280
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:11,316
Put your hands down.

281
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,526
What was your class?

282
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:14,778
Sit down.

283
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,614
You are my senior Marine!

284
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:20,284
Are you really going to make me get up?

285
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,119
Now sit down.

286
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:26,331
Once a Marine, always a Marine, sir!

287
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,792
- Whoa!
- Go easy on him.

288
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:32,171
This punk trying to one up on me.

289
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:35,090
No, sir.
It's the Marine spirit.

290
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,592
Uh, sir, he's just high on pride.

291
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,970
If you could let him off the hook
this one time.

292
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:41,471
"High on pride"?

293
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:43,974
Oh, uh, too much MCP, sir.

294
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:45,184
And what is that, huh?

295
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,811
- It's short for Marine Corps Pride.
- Ah.

296
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,354
What's your class?

297
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,565
He's high on MCP.

298
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:53,025
Please tell me.

299
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:58,238
571. Happy?

300
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,158
Sir.

301
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:03,118
Salute!

302
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,584
And you?

303
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,337
You think I can't put up a fight?

304
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:16,423
Mr. Choi might worry about you.

305
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:18,217
That's all.

306
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:20,886
I started this thing.

307
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:22,596
I'm gonna end it.

308
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:24,431
Okay.

309
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:27,768
Okay.

310
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:30,103
We strike tonight.

311
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:34,608
Once you take down the sales director,
you'll have to call me directly.

312
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:36,109
I'll be at the hospital.

313
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:37,444
Got it.

314
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:39,238
Why do we have to wait to go in?

315
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:42,616
If the director has goons protecting him,
they're onto us.

316
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:44,201
That means thugs are at the hospital.

317
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:47,162
Isn't it dangerous
for Du-yeong to go in alone?

318
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,498
He's too fast for them.

319
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:54,544
Wouldn't it be safer
if we all ganged up on Kim Jun-min,

320
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:55,963
and went with him to the hospital?

321
00:20:56,672 --> 00:21:00,759
Once they know that we're coming for them,
it's going to be all hands on deck.

322
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:02,511
And we're dead.

323
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:04,179
There's too many.

324
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:07,599
That's why we split up
and hit at the same time.

325
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:11,645
- Mm-hm.
- It's risky, but it's how we win this.

326
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:16,275
I'm on a motorcycle.

327
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,069
I'll dip if it gets rough.

328
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:23,115
What do you think we should do?

329
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:25,701
Can you ride a motorcycle?

330
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:27,703
No.

331
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,288
They're way too fast.

332
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:30,706
What?

333
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:32,749
Nothing, sir.

334
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,669
I'll bring these guys with me.

335
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:37,004
I may need help at the hospital.

336
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:37,921
Okay.

337
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,631
Then I'll go with Du-yeong, okay?

338
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:40,882
I'll bring my bike.

339
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:42,843
All right.

340
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:44,511
Shall we have some food?

341
00:21:45,095 --> 00:21:46,346
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

342
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,973
I didn't know you rode.

343
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:49,725
- Yeah.
- What kind?

344
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:51,518
I ride a naked bike.

345
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,354
Hey, we look kinda similar, yeah?

346
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:56,732
- Right?
- Yeah.

347
00:21:57,607 --> 00:21:58,483
Damn it.

348
00:21:58,567 --> 00:22:00,235
Why are you mad? We look good.

349
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,445
Where'd you serve, sir?

350
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:03,155
Just leave it be.

351
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:05,032
Stop it, man.

352
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:06,783
Hey, Min-dong.

353
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:10,370
- Get some soup and rice.
- Yes, sir.

354
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:13,165
Duk.

355
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,625
- How are you?
- Oh, good. Been a while.

356
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:17,210
This is my friend.

357
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:18,545
- Oh, hello.
- Hi.

358
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:20,464
I've already prepped.

359
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:24,509
The new ones are beautiful.

360
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:30,515
- Have you ridden one?
- Yeah, briefly a while back.

361
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:32,851
You're both Marines.

362
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:35,062
They taught you how to use knives, right?

363
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:36,855
- Try this.
- Oh, no.

364
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:38,732
They didn't?

365
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:39,900
- No.
- No.

366
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:44,946
Then take these.

367
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:48,575
Sir, are we… planning on using knives?

368
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:53,413
- Did I just say that?
- Well, you just offered them.

369
00:22:53,997 --> 00:22:55,207
I did.

370
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,500
I'm sorry, sir!

371
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:02,881
You need to know how to use a knife,
so you can counter someone using one.

372
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:04,925
You need to know how they think.

373
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:06,718
Oh.

374
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:07,636
You scared me.

375
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:12,808
Okay. This one's yours.

376
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,102
It's the fastest.

377
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,319
It suits you.

378
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:29,950
Sashimi knives don't have a guard
between the hilt and blade.

379
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:31,827
Because it's not meant to stab.

380
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,871
Now, look. If you stab hard,

381
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:39,501
your hand slides forward,
and the blade fucks you up.

382
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:41,002
If you want to stab with this,

383
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,796
you need to support the end.

384
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:45,674
And that…

385
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,092
…prevents slipping.

386
00:23:47,843 --> 00:23:50,804
If they come at you like this,
what do you think they're going for?

387
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:53,390
They're probably trying to slash
your hand or wrist, sir.

388
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:55,600
That's right. Not a kill attack.

389
00:23:56,685 --> 00:24:00,021
In boxing terms,
it would be like throwing light jabs.

390
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,398
- Mm-hm.
- Ah.

391
00:24:03,316 --> 00:24:06,695
Once more! Keep it up.

392
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:09,906
Loosen up and keep circling.

393
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:20,834
And if they're supporting the hilt
with both hands,

394
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:23,170
It's the kill.

395
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,674
If you push down the knife
with your thumb,

396
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:30,343
your hand won't slide
unless there's a lot of force behind it.

397
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:34,139
If they're using this grip,
it means they're experienced.

398
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:36,516
You're swinging like a bat.

399
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,851
- So relax?
- It's too much force.

400
00:24:37,934 --> 00:24:38,894
- Uh-huh.
- That's right.

401
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,153
That's it!

402
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:01,583
- What the hell? Amazing.
- Show me. Show me.

403
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,502
Try to fuck with me,
and I'll kill you.

404
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:06,087
Deal the cards.

405
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,340
- Fuck. Let me have this.
- Hey, show me.

406
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:11,927
What's up, man?

407
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:20,810
You fucking pricks!

408
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,039
We'll wait here.

409
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:06,690
Whoa, whoa!

410
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:09,734
- Which apartment are you visiting?
- 603.

411
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:14,072
A car is coming.

412
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:32,257
There's a goon.

413
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:33,717
What now?

414
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:36,469
We'll wait.

415
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:42,851
INCOMING CALL

416
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,060
Damn it.

417
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:07,042
Thank you.

418
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:09,044
Now, listen.

419
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,129
If you want to survive doing this work,

420
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:12,797
you gotta sell everything.

421
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:14,924
All of it.

422
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:17,552
Your fists, soul,

423
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:19,888
all of your dreams.

424
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:23,850
But you can never sell out
your friends and family.

425
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:25,852
That's no way for you to live.

426
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:28,688
- Yeah.
- Yes.

427
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:31,733
Once we're inside the hospital,

428
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:34,152
if I tell you guys to run,
don't argue and just run.

429
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:36,071
I'll take care of things myself.

430
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:40,075
You hear me?

431
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:45,205
You just said not to abandon our friends
or family, right, sir?

432
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:46,956
I'm a criminal.

433
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:50,418
We may be in the same boat right now,
but we're not a family, all right?

434
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:52,420
We'll never meet again.

435
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:55,423
So don't get attached
to any of this, okay?

436
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:02,639
Understood?

437
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:04,391
Yeah.

438
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:07,519
Yeah.

439
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:27,664
Kim Jun-min is here.

440
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:34,796
What should we do?

441
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:38,049
Mr. Lee, what do we do?

442
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:40,301
Can you hear me?

443
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:43,221
- Just answer me.
- It's a go.

444
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,282
Ah, shit. This asshole!

445
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:15,754
- Fuck!
- Call the hospital, idiot!

446
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:33,813
You son of a bitch!

447
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:40,236
- You motherfucker!
- Die, asshole.

448
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:48,870
Do-hu, put this asshole in the trunk.

449
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:50,330
Get him up!

450
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:55,293
What the hell?

451
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,214
Who is that fucker?!

452
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,054
Fuck!

453
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:10,016
Hey! Whoa, whoa!

454
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:22,821
Are you okay?

455
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:42,632
MAIN BUILDING
PATIENT ROOM, BLOCK 17

456
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:44,843
DU-YEONG

457
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:47,637
What's up?

458
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:50,974
You all right?

459
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:53,017
Okay.

460
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,070
Let's go.

461
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:05,280
- Okay.
- Yes, sir.

462
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:41,232
That was Im Jang-do.

463
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:48,573
BITCOIN

464
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:50,408
That's right, up you go.

465
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:54,621
Damn it!

466
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:24,275
I know. We're just--

467
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:26,861
Hold on.

468
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:28,655
Damn it!

469
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:37,997
The hell?

470
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:09,737
- Let's go.
- Okay.

471
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:16,953
- Careful.
- Okay.

472
00:33:38,307 --> 00:33:41,394
WE'VE GOT IM JANG-DO
TAKING HIM TO DU-YEONG'S STORE

473
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:00,621
Gentlemen.

474
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:01,956
- Hello.
- Hello.

475
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:10,840
Put him in that.

476
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:11,966
Yes.

477
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,261
One, two…

478
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:16,763
Careful with him.

479
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:20,600
Where's the salt?

480
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:21,517
Salt?

481
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:24,062
In the office.

482
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:26,397
Go make some salt water.

483
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:29,567
Find a bucket, dump it in.

484
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:30,777
Okay.

485
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:31,944
- Let's go.
- All right.

486
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:32,862
In the corner.

487
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:33,988
- Okay.
- Yes.

488
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:44,957
Hyeon-ju, you okay?

489
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:46,918
Yeah, are you all right?

490
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:47,960
Mm-hm.

491
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,672
We got Im Jang-do.

492
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:53,466
- Mm-hm.
- What about you?

493
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:56,344
Uh, I was outside, but Du-yeong got him.

494
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:59,472
- Oh.
- He killed him?

495
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:07,230
Let's go make the salt water.

496
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:08,731
- Come on.
- Uh-huh.

497
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,570
We can use this.

498
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:16,072
- Water?
- I think I saw it downstairs.

499
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:16,989
Let's go.

500
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:18,157
Hyeon-ju, come on.

501
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:33,756
Yeah?

502
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,676
I'll be there in five minutes,
so shake him up a little.

503
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:41,264
Oh, and… have Hyeon-ju and the guys watch.

504
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:56,779
What's up?

505
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,824
He told me to have Hyeon-ju watch.

506
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:00,867
Why?

507
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:05,121
I hope she can take it.

508
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:09,167
Hello, sir. This way.

509
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:26,184
Stop. Now show us the stairs.

510
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:27,894
We don't have cameras on that side.

511
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:29,353
Why not?

512
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:30,771
We just don't.

513
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:34,817
Are you kidding me? You shit--

514
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:37,737
So, tell me something.

515
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:40,781
Are there any cameras facing the building?

516
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,783
The police would probably have some.

517
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:52,376
How's Jun-min?

518
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:55,588
He's still unconscious.

519
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:58,132
Go to the management office

520
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:00,635
and get the plates
of the fuckers who attacked him.

521
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:01,552
Yes.

522
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:04,722
Right there, man.

523
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:05,973
How much do we pour in?

524
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:08,434
Uh, didn't he tell us to use it all?

525
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:10,228
It's a lot.

526
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:13,481
Let's put it all in.
I guess that's what he wants.

527
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:15,441
Okay.

528
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:19,612
But why?

529
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:20,696
Making salt water.

530
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:27,870
Bring it here.

531
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:29,080
Uh, yes.

532
00:37:33,209 --> 00:37:34,418
Sit down and watch.

533
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:37,004
Why?

534
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,673
Mr. Choi's orders.

535
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:50,059
My pet peeve is people not talking
when they say they're going to.

536
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:55,731
That means you'll nod your head
only when you have something to say to us.

537
00:37:57,275 --> 00:38:01,028
Because if you nod and don't talk,
I promise I will cut your lips off.

538
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:01,988
Got it?

539
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:42,236
You don't want to talk?

540
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:51,430
Hyeon-ju.

541
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:06,695
Why did you make me watch?

542
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:10,616
Myeong-gil has probably started looking
for Im Jang-do by now.

543
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:12,827
We don't have much time.

544
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:16,288
You watched because I wanted you guys
to know something.

545
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:18,499
What are you talking about?

546
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:21,252
This is not going to end
until someone dies.

547
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:23,754
And there's no guarantee
that someone won't be me.

548
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:27,174
Why would you say something so horrible?

549
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:28,926
- Hyeon-ju.
- That's enough.

550
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:36,142
Hyeon-ju!

551
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:41,105
Mr. Oh, look after her.

552
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:42,064
Yes, sir.

553
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:45,151
Oh, goddammit, that kid.

554
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:50,906
- Gun-woo.
- Uh, yes.

555
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:53,701
If you end up…

556
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:57,163
fighting Myeong-gil,

557
00:40:58,330 --> 00:40:59,748
can you protect the others?

558
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:03,127
Will you please do that for me?

559
00:41:05,087 --> 00:41:06,505
With all of my will, sir.

560
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:09,049
Thank you so much.

561
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:12,136
We don't have much time.

562
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:14,638
Let me teach you just one thing now.

563
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:22,480
In order to take down an organization,
all you need is

564
00:41:24,231 --> 00:41:26,650
dispersion and division.

565
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:31,864
People tend to trust those
that know and empathize with them.

566
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:36,785
If you're not able to gain their trust,

567
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:40,331
your organization can be divided.

568
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:56,305
Take that off.

569
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:14,073
Im Jang-do?

570
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:16,909
I've been led to believe that you

571
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:20,788
may be the one who understands Myeong-gil
the best of all his men.

572
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:24,917
Myeong-gil is a very violent, cruel man.

573
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:27,920
But he's capable
of reading people like a book.

574
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:30,256
He truly gets them.

575
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:34,510
I'm sure plenty of his men
take him at his word.

576
00:42:36,303 --> 00:42:37,304
But you're smarter.

577
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:39,056
You know Myeong-gil.

578
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:44,478
You know he doesn't ever empathize
with any one of his people.

579
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:47,106
He's cold and calculating.

580
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:52,236
Always thinking how best to move
his little pieces to his advantage.

581
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:55,906
You knew all this,
and you still decided to work for him.

582
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:57,908
Why?

583
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:00,536
At first, you were just led by greed.

584
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:02,997
In only one year,

585
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:06,625
he paid you what a major corporate gig
would have paid in five.

586
00:43:06,709 --> 00:43:10,337
Graduating from the Police Academy
was supposed to give you authority,

587
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:12,673
but you ended up getting yourself demoted.

588
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:14,925
It was all about your pride.

589
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:21,390
I suppose that pride was the real reason
you were fine working for him after all.

590
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:25,185
You were confident
that you could keep your sense of agency.

591
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:27,104
You'd never lose that.

592
00:43:28,147 --> 00:43:30,232
Not to a low-life thug.

593
00:43:30,816 --> 00:43:33,277
And if by chance
he found some reason to kill you,

594
00:43:34,278 --> 00:43:36,947
you could just run off

595
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:40,117
with the money you made working for him.

596
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:45,414
Hm, I like that plan.

597
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:50,586
If I took your photo
and decided to sent it to him right now

598
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:54,923
and said that you gave me the names
of the people he had you kill,

599
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:57,259
he would surely believe me over you.

600
00:43:57,343 --> 00:44:01,263
After all, what man wouldn't squeal
if they were in your current position?

601
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:07,436
Then he'd call back
all the men he sent out to find you…

602
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,689
…unleash a pack of bloodhounds,

603
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:12,733
and they'll kill you in no time.

604
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:16,612
You wouldn't even get a chance
to plead your case.

605
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:18,989
He won't let you.

606
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:21,408
Myeong-gil doesn't care about the truth.

607
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:24,536
The math tells him to bury you.

608
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:28,040
I mean,
if there is one person on the planet

609
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:31,168
who knows every single one
of Myeong-gil's crimes,

610
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:33,087
that person is you, isn't it?

611
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:38,967
You know him just as well as I do.

612
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:45,057
If I plant even the smallest seed
of doubt about you to Myeong-gil…

613
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:49,353
you are a dead man.

614
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:50,854
Fuck.

615
00:44:52,022 --> 00:44:53,732
Wait. Damn it.

616
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:57,319
Why should I die?!

617
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,446
Fuck me!

618
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:00,406
Im Jang-do!

619
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:03,826
Shut up and listen to me!

620
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:06,537
If you don't pull yourself together,
you will die.

621
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:12,793
Tell me everything.

622
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:17,506
And I will send you to a safe country
far away from here

623
00:45:17,589 --> 00:45:19,550
with more than enough money to live.

624
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,219
I taught Myeong-gil everything.

625
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:26,432
I know of places
that he hasn't even heard of.

626
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:28,142
This is a promise.

627
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:35,107
You were already planning to leave
sooner or later.

628
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,527
I'm giving you the chance to do it.

629
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:45,033
If I talk,

630
00:45:46,535 --> 00:45:47,828
how much money?

631
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:52,750
I'd answer quickly if I were you.,

632
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:03,135
Myeong-gil and Smile Capital
are going down for good.

633
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:05,721
After that, you're in Guam.

634
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:07,389
I know some people there.

635
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:11,810
You'll have plenty enough
to start a new life.

636
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:21,528
Get him some clothes.

637
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:38,378
How long have you worked for him?

638
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:40,506
Five years.

639
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:42,341
And what is it you do exactly?

640
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:46,595
I ensure Mr. Kim's illegal dealings
fly under police radar

641
00:46:46,678 --> 00:46:50,182
and make sure things run smoothly
if the police do sniff around.

642
00:46:50,265 --> 00:46:52,309
All right, but what did you do?

643
00:46:52,392 --> 00:46:54,770
For small stuff,
me and In-beom handled it.

644
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:57,523
And for bigger things,
we used Kim's service company.

645
00:46:58,148 --> 00:46:59,399
What small stuff?

646
00:46:59,483 --> 00:47:01,485
Like…

647
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:03,987
…filming things to use against people.

648
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:06,406
You threatened Iil Group, am I right?

649
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:10,244
Tell me.

650
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:12,913
Look, Mr. Kim made me do it.

651
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:15,707
He didn't ask you who made you do it.
He asked you what you did.

652
00:47:17,709 --> 00:47:19,711
I gathered some footage
of the Iil Group heir.

653
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:20,921
And?

654
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:25,342
We just… We stripped him.

655
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:26,260
Why?

656
00:47:28,971 --> 00:47:31,056
Tell me everything from the start.

657
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:35,686
There was a 40-story boutique hotel
being built in Gangnam,

658
00:47:35,769 --> 00:47:38,647
but the company went bankrupt
during the pandemic.

659
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:40,941
Mr. Kim got wind of intel

660
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:43,944
that the Iil Group heir
was going to take over the hotel project.

661
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:45,279
But from whom?

662
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:49,491
The hotel became an eyesore,
so Seoul City decided to step in.

663
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:52,160
They were looking for someone with cash.

664
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:55,914
An assemblyman who plays golf with Mr. Kim
recommended him to the mayor.

665
00:47:57,124 --> 00:48:01,169
He wants the… hotel to become a casino.

666
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:06,300
Seoul City said they'd grant him
a permit for it.

667
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:08,343
Mr. Kim got excited.

668
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:10,554
But the Iil Group heir tried to back out,

669
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:13,056
so I forced him to cooperate.

670
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:16,184
How many people have you taken videos of?

671
00:48:16,935 --> 00:48:17,769
Fifty.

672
00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:21,481
And Myeong-gil still has all of them?

673
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:22,399
Yeah.

674
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:25,819
He sees people's weakness
as a source of income.

675
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:30,908
He never gets rid of anything
that's of value to him.

676
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:33,368
Where does he keep these videos?

677
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:38,373
He keeps an encrypted hard drive
in a safe inside his bedroom.

678
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:40,334
But it's this German smart safe.

679
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:43,462
It has a biometric lock.

680
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:47,090
And if he knows
there are any issues arising,

681
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:49,343
he can incinerate everything inside it.

682
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:51,845
He can press a button on his phone,

683
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:53,805
and this thing will burn its contents.

684
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:54,723
Nothing left.

685
00:48:54,806 --> 00:48:57,309
He knows
that this is a double-edged sword.

686
00:48:57,392 --> 00:49:01,229
A weapon in his hands
but evidence for the police.

687
00:49:02,856 --> 00:49:05,442
The service company, is it a gang?

688
00:49:05,984 --> 00:49:06,818
Yeah.

689
00:49:07,361 --> 00:49:08,195
How big?

690
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:12,157
I believe it's around 30,
but they can get more.

691
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,325
And who runs it?

692
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:14,993
It's Mr. Jung.

693
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:17,579
He's basically Mr. Kim's guard dog.

694
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:19,539
He was an MMA fighter,

695
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:22,709
but apparently he was banned
for beating a man to death in the octagon.

696
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:24,670
That's when he was recruited.

697
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:26,380
Who handles the bodies?

698
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:28,966
Mr. Jung takes care of that.

699
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:31,134
Tell me everything you know.

700
00:49:32,594 --> 00:49:33,679
Three years ago,

701
00:49:34,429 --> 00:49:38,183
Mr. Kim had a bit too much to drink
and killed a man with his bare hands.

702
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:40,894
I was nearby at the time,

703
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:43,730
so I handled the scene
until Mr. Jung arrived.

704
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:46,316
He called a 3-ton fish truck
with an aquarium

705
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,818
and carried the body away.

706
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:52,155
From the way he spoke to the driver,
it seemed like he did this a lot.

707
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:53,907
The name?

708
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:57,160
I don't remember the name.

709
00:49:58,954 --> 00:49:59,955
I see.

710
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:02,374
I know a hospital in Incheon.

711
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:05,252
I'll call an ambulance,
and you'll get some rest.

712
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:06,920
Once everything is over,

713
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:10,841
I'll arrange a flight and ID for you.

714
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:16,972
Do not try to contact anyone.

715
00:50:18,056 --> 00:50:19,391
Otherwise, he'll find you.

716
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:26,690
Your phone. I'm keeping it.

717
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:35,782
Let me ask you one last thing.

718
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:40,287
Where does he keep his gold stashed?

719
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:43,248
Only In-beom knows.

720
00:50:44,833 --> 00:50:45,834
Tell me why that is.

721
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:48,920
In-beom is the only person Mr. Kim trusts.

722
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:50,630
They met in prison.

723
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:53,425
and they've saved each other's lives
multiple times.

724
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:55,802
In-beom would give his life for him.

725
00:50:56,845 --> 00:50:59,014
I don't know everything
Mr. Kim is thinking,

726
00:50:59,514 --> 00:51:01,933
but I know In-beom is like a brother.
