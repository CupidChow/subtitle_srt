I really appreciate your hard work

Nothing. Let's go.

00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,240

and you had to take care of me.

50
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,440
You should watch how much you drink.

51
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,000
It's dangerous to get drunk alone.

52
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,440

I'll sit and wait, then.

Yup.

75

Boss,

76
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,600
are you a vegetarian or what?

77
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,880
No.

78
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,000
You have to be careful

79
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,320
of how much fat and calories
you're taking in for dinner.

80
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,080
Our diet

81
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,640

82
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,840

83
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,160
I'm still growing.

84
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,240
Furthermore,

85
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,520
I don't grow fat
no matter how much I eat,

86
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,320
and I need meat.

87
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,320
Let's go.

88
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,560

89
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,240

Ben,

93
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,720
although

94
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,720
we've only knew each other
for two months,

95
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,600
for me, it felt like
we've known each other forever.

96
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,160
You saved me

97
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,880
when I was at my lowest.

98
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,080
I'll forever

99
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,960
remember this, Ben.

100
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,920
Will you come back?

101
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,640
I...

102
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,160
Thank you for the souvenirs.

103
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,920
I think my friends would love them.

104
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:49,760
This is just so delicious, Boss.

105
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,600
Boss,

106
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,160
why aren't you eating?

107
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,240
My metabolism

108
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,840
doesn't work
as quickly as you youngsters.

109
00:07:58,840 --> 00:07:59,920
I dare not indulge.

110
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,320
This is Merlot.

111
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,400
It goes well with steak.

112
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,400
How particular.

113
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,440
Different red wines

114
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,800
enhances the different characteristics
of different types of steak.

115
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,760
This steakhouse serves grass-fed steak.

116
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,240
Grass-fed steak is known to be

117
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,680
less fatty

118
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,240
firm.

119
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,600
And, because it's less fatty,

120
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,280
so you'd taste a slight acidity.

121
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,880
Merlot has a rich fruity aroma,

122
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,960
which compensates for the lack of fat

123
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,400
and make the overall taste
more substantial.

124
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,920
How impressive, Boss.

125
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,240
Unlike me,

126
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,640
I could only tell

127
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,200
if the food tastes good or not.

128
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,960
I'll try it.

129
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,200
The Merlot's good, Boss.

130
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:54,840
It's my first time

131
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,480
getting such extraordinary
staff benefit.

132
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,040
Good. Have more.

133
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,040

154
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,360

190
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,400
(Thank you.)

191
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,560
(I will take good care
of the warmth you've given me.)

192
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,480
(Bye)

193
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,110
♪But maybe that's the perfect love♪

194
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:55,940
♪As they say♪

195
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,680
Please, come in.

196
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:00,800
This is it?

197
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,040
Follow me upstairs.

198
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,400
Come.

199
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,400
Okay.

200
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Young Master.

201
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,240
Uncle Quan?

202
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,080
Uncle Quan.

203
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:29,040
Your restaurant's business
is doing well.

204
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:31,280
Thank you, Uncle Quan.

205
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,520
I'll let both of you talk.

206
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:33,880
I'm leaving.

207
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,920
Why don't you stay
and have a meal with us?

208
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:35,760
It's okay.

209
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,160
Bye.

210
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,600
Bye, Uncle Quan.

211
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,200
This way, please.

212
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,080
Your business is doing really well.

213
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,880
No wonder, Xia Yuan's
no where to be seen since morning.

214
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,040
Xia must be at

215
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,960
Hui's place now.

216
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:57,880
Oh you, Peter Pan.

217
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:59,560
How ungenerous of you.

218
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,200
You see your son as everything,

219
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,840
and I'm nothing in your eyes.

220
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,520
You should've at least told me

221
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,600
so I could go there too.

222
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,000
There, there.

223
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,320
Don't blame me, kid.

224
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,280
Since Hui moved out,

225
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,560
us father and son

226
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,640
haven't seen each other.

227
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,400
Sometimes, I even doubt

228
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,080
if my relationship

229
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,280
with my son

230
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,320
could be salvaged in this lifetime.

231
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,520
You know,

232
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,400
the relationship
between fathers and sons

233
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,800
needs to be regulated and lubricated.

234
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,760
Hui's mother played such a role

235
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,440
when she was still alive.

236
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:40,200
Now that

237
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,480
Xia has appeared,

238
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,240
my hope has been reignited.

239
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,440
Well, I can't

240
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,960
always let Xia Yuan be your hope.

241
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,040
Okay, okay.

242
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,800
Don't be so stingy.

243
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,640
I'm just borrowing her for a while.

244
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,240
Besides, please understand my feelings

245
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,720
as a father.

246
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,800
Please?

247
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,280
Well, okay.

248
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,200
We're good pals.

249
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,320
I treat your son as mine too.

250
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:08,880
That's right.

251
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,920
What? You treat my son as yours too?

252
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,240
Hui,

253
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,840
do you know

254
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,680
why are we at the winery?

255
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,840
It's because of Mr. Xu.

256
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,040
Mr. Xu saved me

257
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,360
and placed me at the winery

258
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,160
in order to protect us.

259
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,000
Before this,

260
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,840
I worked at Loris' company.

261
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,080
Unexpectedly,

262
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,640
I got caught up in a business conflict

263
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:55,440
and even got kidnapped by him.

264
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,640
It was Mr. Xu

265
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,520
who saved Hao Weilai and I.

266
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:01,120
I've been wondering

267
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,720
how did we get

268
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,400
to such vast difference

269
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,120
between our perspective of Mr. Xu.

270
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:13,920
Perhaps, others view him

271
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,120
as one who's heavy with sentiment.

272
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,280
But in my eyes,

273
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,840
he's still an irresponsible father.

274
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,000
For my mother,

275
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,400
he's an even more irresponsible husband.

276
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,600
Of course,

277
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,560
I'm thankful to him for protecting you.

278
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,360
But this can't be
the reason to forgive him.

279
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:35,520
I understand how you feel.

280
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,360
You can't.

281
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,840
You can't understand how hopeless

282
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,320
and helpless I was.

283
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:54,160
I apologise, Yuan.

284
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,880
Anyway, this is my family matter.

285
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,920
I'll settle it.

286
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,880
Let's not allow it to affect us.

287
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,840
Eat up.

288
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,320
Okay.

289
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,920
Mr. Xu,

290
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,200
I've been there.

291
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,360
Young Master's restaurant was crowded.

292
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,440
It wasn't too late when we arrived.

293
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,160
But there weren't many empty seats left.

294
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,880
I also heard

295
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,360
that the restaurant got good reviews.

296
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,240
And, there were many
returning customers.

297
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,240
Every calls

298
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,600
Young Master

299
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,760
owns the best Chinese restaurant.

300
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,720
That's good to hear.

301
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,800
How do Hui's dishes taste?

302
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,720
Not bad.

303
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,440
But they don't look like

304
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,560
traditional Chinese dishes.

305
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,360
Instead, they look like
European-styled Chinese dishes.

306
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,560
I'm not used

307
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,000
to such taste.

308
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,320
You should be contented.

309
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,720
I haven't even gotten the chance

310
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,280
to taste my son's cooking.

311
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,560
Mr. Xu,

312
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,200
it's easy

313
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,040
if you'd like to do so.

314
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,240
I'll order take-out for you.

315
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,280
No, no.

316
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,920
That's different.

317
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,160
I hope that my son

318
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,400
would invite me

319
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,800
to taste his cooking one day.

320
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,720
By the way,

321
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,800
I heard from Xia

322
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,240
that Hui's not willing
to reconcile with me.

323
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,240
Mr. Xu,

324
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,120
please don't blame Young Master.

325
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,520
Xia said

326
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,280
he needs some time.

327
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,640
Take it slow.

328
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,400
Okay.

329
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,720
Got it.

330
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,880
By the way,

331
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,800
how do Hui's dishes taste?

332
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,400
I just told you just now.

333
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,440
I'm getting old.

334
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,120
Yes, yes.

335
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,520
"Harmony in the family leads
to prosperity in all undertakings".

336
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,760
Such a tacky name.

337
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,640
(Old man,)

338
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,640
(how have you been?)

339
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,360
(I...)

340
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,920
Forget it.

341
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,120
Little brat.

342
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,600
Boss, it's late.

343
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,240
Why aren't you asleep?

344
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,320
Are you hungry?

345
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,360
No.

346
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,280
It's not healthy eating this
in the middle of the night.

347
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,160
Who said so?

348
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,960
This is non-fried instant noodle,

349
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,080
and I added vegetables.

350
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,200
Look.

351
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,360
Non-fried instant noodles?

352
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,880
I see that you've added vegetables.

353
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,280
Why don't you taste it?

354
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,280
I think

355
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,480
I should.

356
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,080
I'm getting some water.

357
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,000
Remember to do the dishes.

358
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,360
I'm going to bed.

359
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,560
Thank you.

360
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,480
Wei Xuesong.

361
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,960
What are you doing?

362
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,160
Cooking.

363
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,360
Why are you here?

364
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,240
Cooking?

365
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,080
For who?

366
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,280
For me?

367
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,680
Let me help.

368
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,200
You'll just mess things up.

369
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,920
And I don't think you're much of a chef.

370
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,320
Have you forgotten
what happened the last time?

371
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,600
Go on out.

372
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:16,800
What are you doing here?

373
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,400
Remember to leave out the spice.

374
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,360
I don't take spicy stuff.

375
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,280
What?

376
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:38,960
By the way,

377
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,080
from now onwards,

378
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,000
I'll need you to purchase some things.

379
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,600
Remember to get

380
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,080
only organic vegetables.

381
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,360
What's wrong?

382
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:53,360
Nothing. I'm just hungry.

383
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,000
I've been hungry
from last night until now.

384
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:58,280
How petty.

385
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,840
It's just a bowl of instant noodles.

386
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:02,520
Okay.

387
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,080
To compensate you,

388
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,480
you're allowed
to buy to your heart's content today.

389
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,240
Go wild.

390
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,640
Really?

391
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,080
Boss,

392
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:15,560
it's just a bowl of instant noodles.

393
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,720
Do I look like one who's petty?

394
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,840
Just tell me if you feel like

395
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:19,840
having instant noodles.

396
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,440
I'll cook for you anytime.

397
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:23,720
And now,

398
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,360
it's showtime for me.

399
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,160
Go.

This car

415
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,960
has always lingered about
the entrance of the winery.

416
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,720
You guys have to be extra watchful.

417
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,400
Let me see.

418
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,160
Something smells really good.

419
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,080
I could smell your cooking from afar.

420
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,200
Taste them.

421
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:19,520
Delicious.

422
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,800
They taste like how I remembered them.

423
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,240
This is the taste of Mum's cooking

424
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,400
when I was little.

425
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,240
Have some lemon water.

426
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,440
It refreshes the palate.

427
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,600
Yuan,

428
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,560
this isn't greasy at all.

429
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:40,720
But this dish

430
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,680
tastes different than the one
served in my restaurant.

431
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,880
It evoked so many
beautiful memories for me.

432
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,440
Maybe it's because

433
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,400
you grew up abroad.

434
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,920
The Chinese cuisine you had

435
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,960
is all localized abroad,

436
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,920
which doesn't have
the essence of Chinese cooking.

437
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,680
I have enjoyed this dish
since I was young.

438
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,520
But I haven't enjoyed

439
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,960
such a familiar taste in a long time.

440
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,560
Yuan,

441
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,040
I have a favour to ask.

442
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:07,400
I want to be your student

443
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,560
to learn cooking

444
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,120
your Gong Bao Chicken.

445
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,320
Sure.

446
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,120
That's a promise.

447
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,280
Dig in.

448
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,440
Boss,

449
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,360
I'm carrying so much.

450
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,440
Aren't you helping me?

451
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:35,440
Why can't you be a gentleman?

452
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,080
What did you just call me?

453
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,120
"Boss".

454
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,240
That's right.

455
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,080
Your my staff, and I'm your boss.

456
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,480
That's about right.

457
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,400
You think being rich makes you great?

458
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:02,360
Where are you going?

459
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,760
I'll be back in a minute.

460
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,760
Where have you been?

461
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,960
For you.

462
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,200
For me?

463
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:47,880
It's so small.

464
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,000
It's not even suitable
to be used as a pillow.

465
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,760
What are you doing?

466
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,320
Getting a bigger one for you.

467
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,360
It's okay.

468
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:57,320
You'll just

469
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,440
be abandoning it.

470
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,920
It'd be sad.

471
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,960
Right?

472
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,080
Get in the car.

473
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:36,360
Hui.

474
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,200
You must be wondering

475
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,680
why I do that.

476
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,720
My mum hadn't received any flowers
from him when she was alive.

477
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,240
What the use doing that now

478
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:48,680
when she's already gone?

479
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:51,400
Hui,

480
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,080
I don't know what happened

481
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:54,760
between you and Mr. Xu.

482
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,720
But since

483
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,240
I came to the winery,

484
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,160
Mr. Xu

485
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:03,240
would place a fresh bunch
of purple forget-me-nots

486
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,280
on the grave every day.

487
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,320
It represents long-lasting appreciation

488
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,040
and long-lasting love.

489
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,720
My mum

490
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,680
lived her life for him.

491
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,440
When he said he wanted to
make a living away from home in Europe,

492
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,000
my mother came with him
without saying a word.

493
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,320
But as we got through the toughest times

494
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,080
and life got better and better,

495
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,800
he came home less.

496
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,400
The smile on Mum's face
gradually disappeared.

497
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,760
I wish

498
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:41,120
that he had spent more time with us.

499
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,800
I still remember at every mealtime,

500
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,920
my mum would make a table
full of his favourite dishes.

501
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,000
But in the end, it was always
the two of us who ate them.

502
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,880
Since then, I have been hating him.

503
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,600
But my mother had never complained.

504
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:04,320
On the day my mother passed,

505
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,320
it happened to be her birthday.

506
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,840
Mum waited for him the whole day.

507
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,600
She waited till it was late.

508
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,480
But he didn't even show up.

509
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,600
It wasn't until Mum passed

510
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,520
that he remembered to come home.

511
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,520
But I'm the only one left at home.

512
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,200
He even forgot such an important day.

513
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,000
He has no heart.

514
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,480
I apologise, Yuan.

515
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,200
I shouldn't be telling you this.

516
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,200
It's just that the dishes
you've made today

517
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:51,120
reminded me of my mum.

518
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,360
I started Zhen's Chinese Restaurant

519
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,640
to remember the taste
of my mum's cooking.

520
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,320
But it seems like
something's still missing.

521
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,040
Hui,

522
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,800
I'm happy

523
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,680
that you felt the warmth

524
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,520
after tasting my dishes.

525
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,440
I do hope

526
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:13,080
that you could be happy every day.

527
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,160
But I could only teach you

528
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,200
the techniques in cooking

529
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,120
but not the soul it needs.

530
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:23,080
The reason

531
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,760
your mum's dishes carry warmth,

532
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,280
is because her heart

533
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:29,160
is filled with love for you

534
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,080
and Mr. Xu.

535
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,000
If you'd want to keep such taste,

536
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,320
you heart

537
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:39,040
must also be filled
with love toward family.

538
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,320
I think your mum

539
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,880
would be very pleased

540
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,920
if she could see it, right?

541
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:02,840
Xia Yuan,

542
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,280
thank you.

543
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,840
It feels so much better to let it out.

544
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:08,120
That's good to know.

545
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,160
I'll head back.

546
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,920
I'll learn cooking from you another day.

547
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,000
Sure.

548
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:19,920
Xia Yuan.

549
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,160
What's up?

550
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,520
I like you.

551
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,800
Boss,

552
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,760
you're impressive.

553
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,240
You practiced?

554
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,800
You did.

555
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,560
Boss, you resemble a polar bear.

556
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,280
Why do you say so?

557
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:18,480
Your build and your aura
is like that of a polar bear.

558
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,960
And, polar bears lives in solitary.

559
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:25,520
Wait.

560
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,360
Polar bears are carnivores

561
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,640
but you're a herbivore.

562
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,080
But polar bears eat plants

563
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,480
in summer.

564
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:35,400
It's a mix of meat and plants,

565
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,680
like me.

566
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,480
You're knowledgeable.

567
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,080
All done.

568
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,560
So?

569
00:32:57,760 --> 00:32:59,920
Did I treat you good today?

570
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,760
Boss, I'm very contented.

571
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,560
Boss, you're impressive.

572
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,200
Did you operate a restaurant before?

573
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,840
Your plating

574
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,600
is exceptional.

575
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,120
My motto is,

576
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,160
you could fail at cooking

577
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,080
but not plating.

578
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:21,160
You're much better than me.

579
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,320
We'd be lucky

580
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,080
if my dishes were edible.

581
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,200
Wait.

582
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,920
We're lacking the most important
accompaniment.

583
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,640
There's still something else?

584
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,640
You've got to

585
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:34,000
spice things up in life.

586
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,600
Alright. Everything's served.

587
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:39,400
Let's dig in.

588
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,400
Okay.

589
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,680
Listening to music while dining

590
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:52,760
makes it a special experience.

591
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,600
This is a famous British piece.

592
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,520
It's composed with irregular melody.

593
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,520
The whole piece is full of optimism

594
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,080
and candidness.

595
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,400
I think it suits you very well.

596
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,160
Boss,

597
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:10,400
are you praising me?

598
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,560
A toast.

599
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,200
Thank you for your instant noodles.

600
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,600
Thank you for your steak.

601
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,720
(After today,)

602
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,600
(Gong Bao Chicken will be off the menu.)

603
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,880
(I apologise)

604
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,200
(for serving unauthentic dishes
to my customers.)

605
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,360
Nah.

606
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,720
Don't overthink it.

607
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,440
I might just be talking nonsense.

608
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,240
Perhaps,

609
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,280
your European customers

610
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,600
love

611
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:45,720
European-styled Chinese dishes.

612
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,600
(I'm hanging up.)

613
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,400
(I need to attend to matters.)

614
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,720
Alright. Get busy.

615
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,200
Rest early.

616
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:53,200
Goodnight. Bye.

617
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,760
What are you doing

618
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,680
sneaking around?

619
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,440
Are you eavesdropping on me?

620
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,640
Who were you on the phone with?

621
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,520
It was

622
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,520
Hui.

623
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,040
You cooked the those dishes

624
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,760
specially for him today?

625
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,200
Yes.

626
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,680
Hui said he hasn't had
authentic Chinese dishes before.

627
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,040
So I made some

628
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,600
specially for him.

629
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,240
He said he liked them.

630
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,360
What else did you guys talk about?

631
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,240
There's a lot.

632
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:43,720
We talked about the conflict
between him and Mr. Xu,

633
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,440
and, his future plans,

634
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:46,440
ideals in life,

635
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,520
and much more.

636
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,600
What else?

637
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,000
Why are you asking?

638
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,560
He's confessed his feelings for you,

639
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,400
and you're not even telling me?

640
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,480
What do you think of it?

641
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,880
What should I think of it?

642
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,440
How would I know

643
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,120
what do you think of it?

644
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,320
Anyway, I don't think you two
make a good pair.

645
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,480
And?

646
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:24,480
Get over here.

647
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,440
So?

648
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,000
Well, I'm thinking,

649
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,400
he's so young

650
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,160
and you're so much older than him...

651
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,160
I don't mean it that way.

652
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,000
I just think the age gap

653
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,320
between you two is vast.

654
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,240
He

655
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,960
isn't that matured yet.

656
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,840
If you force yourselves
into a relationship,

657
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,240
it's possible

658
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,960
that you'll be arguing half of the time.

659
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,360
So,

660
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,480
I think,

661
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,760
you two aren't suitable for each other.

662
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,400
Do you get it

663
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,560
if I put it in this way?

664
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:13,840
Nope.

665
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,920
In that case, I'm going to bed.

666
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,160
Hao Weilai.

667
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,040
What's up? Is there anything?

668
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:31,880
Next time,

669
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,560
just say what you intend to.

670
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,680
If you haven't thought about it well,

671
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,200
then just keep quiet.

672
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:51,800
Are you not leaving?
I need to go to bed.

673
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,840
Neither did you cook specially for me.

674
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,400
What happened?

675
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,560
The internet's down.

676
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,800
Boss,

677
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,800
what happened?

678
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,520
I've turned off the switch to your room.

679
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,360
The key to the electrical box
is with me.

680
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,240
Rest early. Goodnight.

681
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,240
How cruel.

682
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,160
Customers are demanding
for a lower price again.

683
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,560
Compared to the quality of the wine,

684
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,560
they care more about the profit.

685
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,120
Times have changed.

686
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,720
Plus,

687
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:06,120
our approach is more traditional.

688
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,880
And, without young people
to expand our business,

689
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,760
the winery's sales
will definitely be affected.

690
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,760
Yeah.

691
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,480
If there's no new blood in the company,

692
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,080
it'd be hard for us

693
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,240
to go on in this market.

694
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,480
So that's the case.

695
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,400
It seems that
the situation at the winery

696
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,320
is tougher than we imagined.

697
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,440
Yeah.

698
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,480
I used to hear about

699
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,560
the challenges the winery faced,

700
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,240
but I didn't expect it to be so bad.

701
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,640
I really didn't expect

702
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,000
that Mr. Xu would be
so devoted to the winery.

703
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,480
I showed him the wine label I designed.

704
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,320
He gave me quite a few suggestions.

705
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,600
In fact, the difficulties
the winery's facing

706
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,760
are somewhat similar
to those of my family.

707
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,040
Fixed staffing,

708
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,040
fixed mindset,

709
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,320
only focusing on production,

710
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,120
not having their self-owned brand.

711
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,280
Lack of core competitiveness.

712
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,680
Yes, lack of core competitiveness.

713
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,480
So,

714
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,480
we need to help the winery

715
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:07,200
enhance its core competitiveness

716
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,640
and take it far and wide.

717
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,440
Any idea how?

718
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:13,840
Of course.

719
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,520
While you were busy,

720
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:16,880
I didn't stay idle.

721
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:17,680
I am planning

722
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,760
to set up an open house

723
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,040
for people from all walks of life

724
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:21,440
to come and experience

725
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,040
and tour our winery.

726
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,320
First, we can take them

727
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,960
to our vineyard,

728
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,840
and then to see our grape trees.

729
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,640
Then,

730
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,480
we can take them

731
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,840
to our winery

732
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,080
to taste some wine,

733
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,600
but not our wine.

734
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,320
We can have

735
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,520
various brands of wine

736
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,680
and let them taste

737
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,440
and pick the best.

738
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,720
I believe our wine

739
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,280
would be the best.

740
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:57,440
Yuan.

741
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,080
Hui, you wanted to see me?

742
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:01,000
I made a dish for you to try.

743
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:02,000
Really?

744
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,000
I can't wait for you to taste it.

745
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:04,760
What dish is it?

746
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,000
Gong Bao Chicken?

747
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
Yes.

748
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,240
Hui, we are about to have lunch.

749
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,360
Would you like to have Mr. Xu
to taste your dishes as well?

750
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,400
No.

751
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,560
I made this just for you.

752
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,200
Xia,

753
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,600
it's lunch. You don't need us
to invite you to the table, do you?

754
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,160
Hui,

755
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,440
you're here.

756
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,840
What are you two up to?

757
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,120
I made a dish

758
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,720
and wanted Xia Yuan to taste it.

759
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:44,400
A dish-tasting?

760
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,640
Peter Pan happened to be hungry.

761
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:46,880
Why don't you try some too?

762
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,160
Yes. It's a dish-tasting.

763
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:50,040
Let's get everyone to taste it

764
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,120
to get an accurate feedback. Here.

765
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,360
Uhm...

766
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,560
Have a seat.

767
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,120
Mr. Xu, please taste.

768
00:41:57,480 --> 00:41:58,480
Okay.

769
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,240
Hui made this Gong Bao Chicken.

770
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,560
Yuan, you try some too.

771
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:02,120
Thank you.

772
00:42:02,120 --> 00:42:03,120
Xia Yuan.

773
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:05,680
Get over there.

774
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,480
You try some too.

775
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,520
