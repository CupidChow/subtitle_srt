00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:10,960
Yuan.

381
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,760
How's your day today?

382
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,000
Not bad.

383
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,720
Although there was a minor hiccup,

384
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,960
it was resolved without an issue.

385
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,280
Overall,

386
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,120
it was quite satisfactory.

387
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,640
Good.

388
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,120
Later, send me the address

389
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,080
of the amusement park.

390
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:23,800
When I'm free,

391
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,440
I'll go there and visit you
together with my boss.

392
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,040
Sure.

393
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,280
You'll always be welcome
to visit the park.

394
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,000
Yuan,

395
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,120
I still have to work.

396
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,200
I can't chat with you any longer.

397
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:32,960
Goodnight.

398
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:36,480
Goodnight.

399
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,680
Although your temperature has gone down,

400
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,800
you are still having a fever.

401
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,160
Take some medicine.

402
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,080
I can do it myself.

403
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,960
Have a good night's sleep.

404
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:15,960
By the way,

405
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,160
this is warm water.

406
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,480
If you feel thirsty at night,

407
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,520
remember to drink it.

408
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,520
You should rest earlier too.

409
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,280
Goodnight.

410
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,320
Goodnight.

411
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,120
(No.)

412
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,560
(I have to add an extra blanket for him)

413
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,720
(so that he can sweat it out.)

414
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,920
The food smells so good.
Let me take a bite.

415
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:01,760
Wait.

416
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,200
It'll be done soon.

417
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,520
It's done now.

418
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,520
Let's plate it.

419
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:11,960
Today,

420
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,240
I talked to our supervisor.

421
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,000
As soon as there's a vacant position,

422
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,280
he'll tell me about it at once.

423
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,640
Then, you don't have to stay
in the Haunted Castle.

424
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,840
You don't have to worry about me.

425
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,240
Actually,

426
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,320
after working there for a day,

427
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,280
I think I've gotten used
to it completely.

428
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:26,720
Come. Let's eat.

429
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:28,880
Hao Weilai.

430
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,240
I know

431
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,640
it's quite difficult

432
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:33,000
to overcome a mental barrier.

433
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,600
And I'm grateful to you

434
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,440
for rescuing me from the Haunted Castle.

435
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,040
But we made a promise.

436
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:40,120
Don't push yourself too hard.

437
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,440
There's no need to thank me.

438
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,880
I should thank you instead.

439
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,360
Although

440
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,920
I was still very nervous when I entered

441
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,040
the Haunted Castle

442
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,120
where it was dark

443
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,520
and I couldn't see anything

444
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,480
until I almost tripped,

445
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,040
I mustered the courage

446
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,920
and ran to the spot
that I was in charge of.

447
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,960
There weren't that many tourists yet.

448
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:02,400
I forced myself to observe
all the mechanisms around me.

449
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,520
Do you know what I found?

450
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:06,640
Those artificial limbs

451
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,680
will spring out every 10 seconds.

452
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,680
They'll stay there for five seconds
and they'll go back in.

453
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,320
For the sound effects,

454
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,440
they'll get louder every five seconds.

455
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,520
They'll stay that way for three seconds
and get softer again.

456
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,320
Meanwhile, the surrounding wind

457
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,520
and water

458
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,760
change according to the lighting.

459
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,960
After I found out about the rhythm,

460
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,600
I was no longer that nervous.

461
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,280
These are controlled by people.

462
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:30,200
And it's like I'm in a large game arena

463
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,200
where you have to upgrade yourself
and kill monsters.

464
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,600
And I'm the monster.

465
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,400
Hao Weilai.

466
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,840
You really love

467
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,120
your data.

468
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,120
At first, I was quite worried about you.

469
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,000
Now, looks like
I had worried for nothing.

470
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:44,560
Xia Yuan.

471
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,240
I'm really grateful to you

472
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,640
from the bottom of my heart.

473
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,160
If it wasn't for you,

474
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,840
I wouldn't

475
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,880
be able to face my inner fear.

476
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,560
Stop.

477
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,560
Stop thanking me.

478
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,680
It has nothing to do with me.

479
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,960
You should thank yourself.

480
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,320
Okay.

481
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,360
By the way, for your position,

482
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,080
it was way harder

483
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,000
than expected.

484
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:10,560
There were so many tourists.

485
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:11,840
I was just standing there for a while.

486
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,840
But my face was already stiff
from all the smiling.

487
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,480
How did you pose?

488
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,160
Teach me.

489
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,320
Don't try to trick me.

490
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,080
I don't remember.

491
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,000
Is it like this?

492
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,320
Like this?

493
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,640
It's like this.

494
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:24,160
Like this.

495
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,040
And like this.

496
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,400
Like this.

497
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,800
Let's eat. The food is getting cold.

498
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:35,920
Okay. Let's eat.

499
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:38,960
Hao Weilai.

500
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,880
Eat properly.

501
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,760
Why are you up?

502
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,480
You are getting hotter and hotter.

503
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,800
Your temperature
has gone up to 39 degrees.

504
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,920
It has gotten worse.

505
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,640
No. You have to go to the hospital.

506
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,000
I'm fine.
I just have to take some medicine.

507
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,760
No. It's not a request. You have to go.

508
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,960
Thank you, sweetheart.

509
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:45,880
Was I not scary?

510
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,000
No.

511
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,760
You are so childish.

512
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,440
Hi, morning.

513
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,280
Hey.

514
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,360
Good day.

515
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,440
You too.

516
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,400
I'm hungry.
I haven't even eaten breakfast.

517
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,160
You haven't started working yet
and you are already hungry.

518
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,280
Hi.

519
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,920
It's time to work.

520
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:10,720
Yes, Sir.

521
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,440
Let's go.

522
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,040
How is he?

523
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,880
Has the patient had
any history of asthma?

524
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,320
Yes, he does.

525
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:44,040
Well. Now, he's suffering
from acute asthma

526
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:48,400
caused by a cold. After we finish
administrating the myocarditis,

527
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,760
we have to keep a check
on his temperature.

528
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,880
So, for now,
we keep an eye on the patient

529
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,000
and make sure

530
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,760
he's resting quietly.

531
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,360
Okay. Thank you.

532
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,160
Did you hear that?

533
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:09,960
Acute myocarditis.

534
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,000
If it wasn't for me,

535
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,960
you would've suffered.

536
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:14,840
But don't worry.

537
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:16,200
I'll take good care of you.

538
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,480
What medicine is this?

539
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,880
I don't understand.

540
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,640
Is it going too fast?

541
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,040
Let me slow it down for you.

542
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,080
You need to lift your hand higher.

543
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:29,640
You have to...

544
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,280
Don't move.

545
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,360
Why did you simply move around?

546
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:34,400
Stop causing trouble.

547
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,520
Sir, I really envy you

548
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,640
for having such
an outstanding employee like me.

549
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,800
Shouldn't you give me a bonus?

550
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:47,760
Actually, I'm not a greedy person.

551
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,400
I'm willing to exchange my bonus
for more time

552
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,640
to sleep.

553
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,720
I understand.

554
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,320
That's a yes, right?

555
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,000
I knew it.

556
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,400
My boss is the best!

557
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,760
I'm sorry, Sir.

558
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,240
Are you okay?

559
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,440
I'm fine.

560
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:03,960
I'm fine.

561
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:05,920
Sir,

562
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,040
do you want to eat something?

563
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,200
I can buy it for you.

564
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:11,440
Do you

565
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,440
want to drink something?

566
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,680
