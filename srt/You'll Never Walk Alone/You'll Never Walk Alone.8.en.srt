00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,040
Kiki, there's something in your hair.

192
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:48,960
What?

193
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,360
No, it's still there.

194
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,840
Come, closer.

195
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,160
Hey, man.
It's none of your business, okay?

196
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:59,120
Qiao Bin, Why are you
messing around here again?

197
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,200
Why do you keep
interfering with my work?

198
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,720
I'm messing around?

199
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,000
He's the one who's messing around, okay?

200
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,480
It was like this with
Huo Mingxuan at the farm,

201
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,040
and it's still like this with him here.

202
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,360
Do you not know how to say no,

203
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,880
Ye Siqi?

204
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,320
Sorry about that.

205
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,320
It's okay. It's not your fault.

206
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,040
Why are you here?

207
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,120
I brought you some food.

208
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,320
What have you been doing?

209
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,840
I'm tired after a long day of lifting.

210
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:50,920
I don't even know what it is.

211
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,280
It's all so heavy.

212
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,920
Let me tell you something strange.

213
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,680
They even tipped me.

214
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:56,880
I wouldn't go

215
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,800
if it wasn't for the tips.

216
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,880
Tom's always picking on me.

217
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,280
Then you eat something

218
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,600
and go to sleep.

219
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,840
You just texted me

220
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,680
that you found
some important clues, right?

221
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,000
I found a lead on Song Hangyu.

222
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,240
It only proves he was here.

223
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,280
It doesn't help us find him.

224
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,680
Siqi?

225
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,440
Qiao Bin?

226
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:37,960
Did the two of them plan this?

227
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,840
What do you think?

228
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,280
Relationships are so hard

229
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,760
to deal with.

230
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,640
I'm so annoyed by Qiao Bin.

231
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,760
I was trying to enlighten Siqi,

232
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:56,800
but I didn't realise

233
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,920
that she's more decisive than I am.

234
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,000
I don't think she needs
my enlightenment.

235
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:01,800
At first,

236
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,600
I thought they were
just having a little fight,

237
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,000
not much of a problem.

238
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,240
But now...

239
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,480
Don't think so much.

240
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,520
When we meet them later,

241
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,880
let's play it by ear.

242
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,680
Who said she wanted to lose weight?

243
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,480
I'm so pissed off.

244
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,240
I'm really pissed off.

245
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,720
Siqi, you've said that
hundreds of times.

246
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,720
Tell me

247
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,360
why you're angry.

248
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,600
Yuan, you have to be prepared.

249
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,360
You're going to be pissed off
when you know.

250
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,080
All right. Tell me now.

251
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,720
Judge for me.

252
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,440
What did I do wrong?

253
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,240
It's just a trifle.

254
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,480
Why are you so angry?

255
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,720
How dare he do that!

256
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,000
You think so, too, right?

257
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,760
Qiao Bin was just too much.

258
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,600
I'm just kidding.

259
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,240
Why should I be angry?

260
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,800
Qiao Bin's a little impulsive.

261
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,280
But he did it for your own good.

262
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,840
Don't get too angry.

263
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,280
And I know he's just being impulsive.

264
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,160
But

265
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,120
I just hate his impulsiveness.

266
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,360
How can I be called impulsive?

267
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:16,360
That guy's been hanging around her.

268
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,400
He was so close to her.

269
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:18,240
I gave him a verbal warning,

270
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,080
but he didn't listen to me
so I got physical with him.

271
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:21,840
Am I incapable of protecting myself?

272
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,840
In his eyes,

273
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,000
I don't even know

274
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,200
how to keep my distance from the others.

275
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,800
She's just too naive

276
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,880
to realise that those people
are up to no good.

277
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,000
I was doing it for her sake.

278
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,840
My foot, for my sake!

279
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,680
After all,

280
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,360
he's just trying to satisfy
his own possessiveness.

281
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,320
I am not.

282
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,120
He is.

283
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,000
I am not.

284
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,480
He is.

285
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,200
Okay, I admit I was
a little out of line.

286
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,400
Well, I was doing it for her sake.

287
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,840
Seriously.

288
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,960
All right.

289
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,360
All right.

290
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,480
Go on.

291
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,360
We're almost there.

292
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,680
Good. Go on.

293
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,960
We're almost there.

294
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,520
Why am I on the same hand and foot?

295
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,480
Go on.

296
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,720
Go on.

297
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,200
Okay, time's up.

298
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,760
All right.

299
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,440
All right. Not bad.

300
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,080
You don't say.

301
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,920
I feel so much more relaxed

302
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,960
after a few sessions.

303
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,000
You feel relaxed

304
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,040
but I'm hungry.

305
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,640
I'm sorry.

306
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,480
I should have treated you to a meal.

307
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,320
Quan,

308
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,120
did you hear that?

309
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,000
Let's buy this Mr. Hao a meal.

310
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,440
You're finally buying me a meal.

311
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,800
I can't wait for that.

312
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,240
We're having a feast. Let's go.

313
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,280
Thank you and sorry.

314
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,280
Come in.

315
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,120
Loris, you're here.

316
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,920
I've prepared the documents
you asked for.

317
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:13,800
I'll bring them to you tomorrow.

318
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:15,080
Okay.

319
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,200
You're the hardest worker
I've ever seen.

320
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,720
That's what I should do.

321
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,440
I have to attend a banquet tonight.

322
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,960
Would you like to go with me?

323
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,800
You're finally back.

324
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,400
What kind of party
was you having so much fun at?

325
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,440
You're back so late.

326
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,240
It's cold at night.
You don't even put on a jacket

327
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,800
when you're so thinly clad.

328
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,040
I'm not

329
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,160
going to the banquet.

330
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,560
There'll be a lot of Chinese
at this banquet.

331
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,400
If you want to know
the news of your friends,

332
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,200
this is a very good opportunity.

333
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,840
But if you already have a date,

334
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,040
then I won't force you.

335
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,400
All right, then.

336
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,080
I'll go.

337
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,120
This gown

338
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,680
is for you.

339
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,840
Loris,

340
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,000
you've helped me a lot

341
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:06,560
since I joined the company.

342
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,880
I won't take anything expensive.

343
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,520
You're my companion.

344
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,480
You represent me.

345
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:14,720
I chose this gown for you myself.

346
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,760
Please take it.

347
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,080
See you tonight.

348
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,800
See you tonight.

349
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:29,870
[Welcome!
Banquet time: 18th October 2018]

350
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:43,920
Thank you.

351
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:49,680
Siqi.

352
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,480
Sophia.

353
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,600
Are you free later?

354
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,120
Can I have a word with you?

355
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,400
Antonia,

356
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,120
can you cover for me?

357
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,120
Yeah, sure.

358
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:02,760
Thank you.

359
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,640
No problem.

360
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,440
Let's go.

361
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:11,840
Siqi,

362
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,320
I really don't know how to put this.

363
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,840
It's okay.

364
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,840
You can say whatever you want.

365
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:23,720
To me,

366
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,120
Qiao Bin

367
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,160
is like my savior.

368
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,720
Ever since I met him,

369
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,760
I've found myself attracted to him.

370
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,440
Your affection for him

371
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,040
is written all over your face.

372
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:37,960
It's obvious

373
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,360
to anyone.

374
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,840
But I also know that you two
have a very special relationship.

375
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,040
I asked him before.

376
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,920
You're the only person in his heart.

377
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:52,840
But I don't know how you feel about him.

378
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,880
If

379
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,760
you two love each other,

380
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,800
I won't bother Ben.

381
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,640
Sophia,

382
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,040
you're so cute.

383
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,600
Qiao Bin and I

384
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,520
were in love.

385
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,840
But because the foundation
of our relationship

386
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,520
was so weak,

387
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,040
the feelings we once had

388
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,240
slowly faded with time.

389
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,720
I chose to marry him

390
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,560
when I barely knew him,

391
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,320
and divorced because
of our different values.

392
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,880
It may seem romantic

393
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,280
to anyone that he'd go out of his way

394
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,920
to come here to find me,

395
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,280
but

396
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,960
I can't accept that.

397
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,120
I chose to stay and work at the beach

398
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,680
not because I still
have feelings for him,

399
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,280
but out of

400
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:49,200
a sense of duty to my friend.

401
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,240
I hope he can

402
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,440
get over his past relationship

403
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:57,480
and find his own happiness.

404
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,320
But Siqi...

405
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,920
Not buts.

406
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,320
Sophia,

407
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,360
in my eyes,

408
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,840
you're always a very brave girl.

409
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,320
But

410
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:11,160
I think you should
know more about Qiao Bin.

411
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,040
How about this?

412
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,240
I'll tell you more

413
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,760
about him.

414
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,960
Maybe it'll help you.

415
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,360
Thank you, Siqi.

416
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,400
Come in.

417
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,080
Oh my God!

418
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,720
You're so pretty.

419
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,600
Who's shining here?

420
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,080
You're exaggerating.

421
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,120
Why are you dressed up?

422
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,080
Loris

423
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,600
is taking me to a banquet.

424
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,760
You can't dress up like this, then.

425
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,000
I can't? Why?

426
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,080
It's unfashionable.

427
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,720
Isn't it good?

428
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:08,480
Come on.

429
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,920
Put it on.

430
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,440
Good.

431
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,720
Why should I wear this?

432
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,400
You're a temptress in that gown.

433
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,160
This doesn't match at all.

434
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,200
Just wear it.

435
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,360
I'm warning you,

436
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,280
watch out for Loris.

437
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,680
Don't eat or drink anything

438
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,520
he gives you.

439
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,640
He might drug you.

440
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,680
There will be so many people
at the banquet.

441
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,520
He can't do anything to me.

442
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,360
What are you doing later?

443
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,680
I'm going to move the goods.

444
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,360
If you can't find me later,

445
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,800
don't worry about me.

446
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,040
I won't worry about you.

447
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,720
Why are you going to
move the goods again?

448
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,120
Parker told me

449
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,080
that I will get more money
this time for moving the goods.

450
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:49,720
I shouldn't say no to money, right?

451
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,640
I have a medicine

452
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,120
for sore muscles.

453
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,800
Would you like to use it?

454
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,080
What do I need it for?

455
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,400
Fine.

456
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,560
I want it.

457
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:02,960
Look, you still care about me.

458
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,160
I'm worried about
the medicine expiring, okay?

459
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,240
Well, be safe when
you're moving the goods.

460
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,360
Be careful.

461
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,320
Okay. Take this off first.

462
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,320
Why are you taking it off?

463
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,680
Let me look at it a little longer.

464
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:18,560
What a nice gown.

465
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,600
I'll put it back on.

466
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,280
Why don't you go and move the goods now?

467
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,080
I'm going now.

468
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,240
Bye.

469
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,520
Bye.

470
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,600
I'm shining?

471
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,680
That's exaggerated.

472
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,640
Perfect.

473
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,160
The guys are ready.

474
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,200
Shall we start?

475
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,720
All right. So, guys,

476
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,160
put your phones in the box
before getting in

477
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,240
the car.

478
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:03,840
Good boy.

479
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,400
Why?

480
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,520
Why?

481
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,040
Because I said so.

482
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,720
Even if I said, "Jump from the window,"

483
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,320
you have to jump from the window.

484
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,520
You get that?

485
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,480
Thanks.

486
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:19,600
Thank you very much.

487
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,680
Check them.

488
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,360
Open the door.

489
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,680
Get in the car, guys.

490
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:45,880
Go.

491
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,640
All right, guys.

492
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,840
Remember, no matter what,
don't take it off.

493
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,920
Seriously.

494
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,080
Okay?

495
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:06,600
Otherwise, well,

496
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,360
I won't be so nice.

497
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,640
Where are we going?

498
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,000
Didn't Parker tell you?

499
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,360
If you want your money,

500
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:18,440
just shut up, okay?

501
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,320
Good boy.

502
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,440
What are you doing?

503
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,960
This is so tight.

504
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,960
It makes me uncomfortable.

505
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:42,840
Yeah?

506
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,680
I'm sure you can resist.

507
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:46,120
We're almost there.

508
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,880
If you can't,

509
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,520
I swear I'm going to make you eat it.

510
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,040
Very well.

511
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,920
You can take your blindfolds off.

512
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,720
Good morning.

513
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,840
And welcome home.

514
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,680
How do you feel?

515
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:50,200
You're welcome.

516
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,840
Let's start.

517
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,400
Go, go, go!

518
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,160
Don't waste your time.

519
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,360
What are you doing?

520
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,480
Don't look around.

521
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,480
Just work.

522
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,440
Okay.

523
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,440
Come on, come on.

524
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,720
Come on, come on.

525
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,760
Guys, wake up.

526
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:46,040
You've arrived.

527
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,280
Let's go.

528
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,400
Hurry up.

529
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,840
Perfect job today.
Great job today, guys.

530
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,760
You know what?

531
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,120
Tomorrow, you've got a day off.

532
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,920
And now, get back your phones.

533
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,280
I almost forgot.

534
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:23,120
Our company has a strict policy.

535
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,160
You cannot tell

536
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,360
anybody what we did today.

537
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:27,240
You know, just...

538
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,320
Keep your mouth shut.

539
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,680
Get your money and forget about it.

540
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,560
Here you go.

541
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,120
This is yours.

542
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,520
Enjoy the cash, guys.
See you after tomorrow.

543
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,440
Have fun tonight.

544
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,880
Now, go.

545
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,520
Go, guys!

546
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,560
Have fun!

547
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:52,920
Xia Yuan, this way, please.

548
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,640
Okay.

549
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:54,720
Thanks. Cheers.

550
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,080
Ms. Xia.

551
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,160
Mr. Xu.

552
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,680
Mr. Xu.

553
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,560
Can I have a minute of your time

554
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,960
to have a word with you?

555
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:08,560
We'll talk later.

556
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,440
Sure.

557
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,120
Okay.

558
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,440
Okay.

559
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,360
We're all businessmen.

560
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,680
With your prices so low,

561
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,360
how do you expect us to make any money?

562
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,400
Sorry,

563
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:28,760
we've been fair with the price.

564
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,760
How about this, Mr. Xu?

565
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,440
We'll keep the price at the same range,

566
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,040
and we'll all make money.

567
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,040
Loris,

568
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,440
do you know the difference
between you and me?

569
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,400
You're trying to make money.

570
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,800
We Chinese value

571
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,120
integrity.

572
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:01,960
They're really good friends of Loris.

573
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,200
If they know something,
they can help you.

574
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,640
You can show them the picture.

575
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,240
So, she's looking for her boyfriend.

576
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,200
He's missing.

577
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,000
If you can help, it will be great.

578
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,240
Here's his picture.

579
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,680
He's my boyfriend.

580
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,760
Do you know him?

581
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,200
No. Sorry, I don't know him.

582
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,120
And you?

583
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,680
No, I don't know.

584
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,760
No, sorry.

585
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,960
I never met him.

586
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:40,840
Thank you.

587
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,840
Don't worry.

588
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,120
Sorry about that.

589
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,240
We'll find him.

590
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,560
Don't worry.

591
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,880
You don't want to see me, do you?

592
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:13,600
Fine.

593
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,160
I'll jump

594
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,880
so you'll never see me again.

595
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,400
Calm down.

596
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:21,640
Go away.

597
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,120
You have nothing to do with me.

598
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,320
Are you drunk?

599
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:24,440
Go away.

600
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,400
Go ahead and jump.

601
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,800
Listen here.

602
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:32,120
I'm not going to stand by
while someone is dying.

603
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,440
But let me tell you this upfront,

604
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,760
I can't swim.

605
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,280
You're also Chinese.

606
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:45,840
Fate has brought

607
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,320
us two Chinese

608
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,840
to meet in a foreign country.

609
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,000
Isn't there such a saying?

610
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,640
It's better to tell

611
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,640
your misery to strangers

612
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,200
because you won't

613
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,440
see them again.

614
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:06,920
How about this?

615
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,480
Tell me

616
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,800
your story.

617
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,840
Fine.

618
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,000
I'll tell my story first.

619
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,200
Let's go. I have a long story to tell.

620
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,520
Let me start first.

621
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,080
A few months ago,

622
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,280
I was an

623
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,720
executive in a company
who was the envy of all.

624
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,640
I had a very outstanding boyfriend.

625
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,320
But

626
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,800
on the day of our engagement ceremony...

627
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,440
(That warehouse
shouldn't be far from here.)

628
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:58,520
(At 60 kilometers an hour,)

629
00:31:58,520 --> 00:32:00,400
(a minute is 1,000 metres,)

630
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,080
(30 seconds is 500 metres.)

631
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:18,840
Go straight out the door,

632
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,480
go 500 metres,

633
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,480
turn right,

634
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,480
and then after 1,000 metres,

635
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:26,680
stop at a traffic light

636
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,480
and turn left.

637
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,200
After 1,000 metres,

638
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,560
I'll hear the sound of a bar

639
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,520
and turn right.

640
00:32:37,410 --> 00:32:39,280
You're worse off than me.

641
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:40,760
Yeah.

642
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,240
Even I've survived
such a miserable thing.

643
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:46,040
Why can't you make it through it?

644
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,680
See, now

645
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:50,320
I can tell it to you as a story.

646
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,040
Time can solve a lot of problems.

647
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,480
You're really tough.

648
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,960
If you have a problem, solve it.

649
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,720
There's a lot of
meaningful things in life

650
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,000
waiting for you.

651
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,120
That's the end of my story.

652
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:09,440
What about you?

653
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,200
Why can't you get over it?

654
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,480
All right, I'll take a guess.

655
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,480
You've fallen out of love.

656
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,800
It's no big deal to fall out of love.

657
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,040
You're so young.

658
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,240
You'll meet a lot of girls
in the future,

659
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,400
and you'll finally find the right girl.

660
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,560
You're an international student.

661
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,520
You failed your exams, didn't you?

662
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,360
It's okay if you don't get good grades.

663
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,720
Just study hard

664
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:36,800
for two more years.

665
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,960
I got it.

666
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,760
You're an AI.

667
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,040
You want to die

668
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,680
because you've been discovered.

669
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,520
That's ridiculous.

670
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,120
It doesn't really matter

671
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,280
what the reason is.

672
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,760
The important thing is

673
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,480
that I've thought it through.

674
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,560
If there are two paths in front of me,

675
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:00,560
I'll choose the one

676
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,600
opposite to the one I just took.

677
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,840
I'll continue to live my life
to the fullest.

678
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,760
Okay.

679
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,560
Let's make a pact today

680
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,000
to live a good life.

681
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,520
This is for you.

682
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,920
This is an amulet
given to me by my parents.

683
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,200
I'll give it to you

684
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,520
to keep you safe

685
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,800
and well in the future.

686
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,600
I can't take this.

687
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:36,400
This is a blessing for you.

688
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,400
If you give it to me,

689
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:38,480
what will you do?

690
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,400
I've kept my parents' blessing

691
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,880
in my heart.

692
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,920
I'm giving this to you

693
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,920
as a continuation of that blessing.

694
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,240
From now on, whenever you're sad,

695
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:50,240
just look at it

696
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,200
and think about what I told you today.

697
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:58,920
Right,

698
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,680
I'm Hui.

699
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,960
I run a Chinese restaurant
on the food street.

700
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,320
Come and try it sometime.

701
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:06,400
Sure.

702
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,080
Hi, Hui.

703
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,400
I'm Xia Yuan.

704
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,440
Can I call you Yuan from now on?

705
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,480
Yes, you can.

706
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,560
Hello, Loris.

707
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,080
I'm walking by the lake.

708
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,680
Okay.

709
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,000
I'll be right back.

710
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:25,800
Bye.

711
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,120
My boss is looking for me.

712
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:29,680
I have to go back now.

713
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:30,360
Bye.

714
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,400
Yuan,

715
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:35,120
you haven't told me where to find you.

716
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,080
I work for Wyatt Company.

717
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,640
(We'll meet again.)

718
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,560
He's picking you up again.

719
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,160
I won't send you in then.

720
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,760
Loris, bye.

721
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,720
Look how pretty you look in this.

722
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,600
You look so young.

723
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,640
I'm so hungry.

724
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,400
I don't have any hot water at my place.

725
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,400
I'll have some instant noodles
at your place.

726
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,320
I'll go back to my room
to get the instant noodles.

727
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,160
Wait for me.

728
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Let me tell you something.

729
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,640
I saved a man today.

730
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,720
You saved a man?

731
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,720
With you dressed like that?

732
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,960
I really saved a man.

733
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,600
Oh, please.

734
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,960
Can you save yourself?

735
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,720
I'm telling you, there are
a lot of bad people out there.

736
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:51,880
Don't be fooled.

737
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:52,880
Stop it.

738
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,400
Listen here,

739
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,400
your image in my mind is crumbling.

740
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,480
What path are you taking now?

741
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,840
A path to becoming a monk?

742
00:36:59,080 --> 00:36:59,840
What image?

743
00:36:59,840 --> 00:37:01,720
My image is that of a successful man.

744
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,640
Successful man?

745
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,800
I'm going to puke.

746
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,000
Don't puke yet.

747
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,200
I have something important to tell you.

748
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,600
I think Loris is running
an illegal business.

749
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:12,600
Why?

750
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:13,560
I thought

751
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,360
there was something wrong
with that warehouse from the start.

752
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,040
Why should they confiscate
our phones when we went in?

753
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,960
Why were we blindfolded on the way in?

754
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,000
It's obvious that they're
trying to hide something.

755
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,240
Do you have any proof?

756
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,080
No.

757
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:27,000
If you don't,
you're just talking rubbish.

758
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,200
It's called intuition.

759
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,560
It's very accurate.

760
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,960
It's fine if you don't believe me.

761
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,760
Just believe that Loris.

762
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,680
I'm stuffed with anger.

763
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,000
I'm going to bed.

764
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,000
Then why do you want noodle?

765
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:38,960
Am I not allowed to eat?

766
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:40,720
That's my noodle.

767
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,920
Give it back to me.

768
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,440
I saved a man.

769
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:47,360
I just saved a man today.

770
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,960
Where is your destination?

771
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,680
I'm not sure.

772
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,360
Just go straight ahead.

773
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,000
Turn right.

774
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,440
Turn right.

775
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:45,260
[Red Lips and Wine Sips]

776
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,600
Go.

777
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:05,680
Turn left.

778
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,360
Go ahead.

779
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:43,560
Stop.

780
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,200
How much?

781
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,720
Stop! Stop! Stop!

782
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,760
Don't run!

783
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,080
Tom,

784
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,200
this is Alex.

785
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,240
Someone broke into our warehouse

786
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,320
and he ran away.

787
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,560
I didn't see his face.

788
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,720
What should I do?

789
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,440
Yeah.

790
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:41,960
What's up? What's happening?

791
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:43,200
No, nothing.

792
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,160
Let's go back, Bro.

793
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,960
Yeah. So many things to do today, Bro.

794
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,200
