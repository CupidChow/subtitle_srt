102
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,960
Do you want to tell everyone

00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,440

Enough.

111
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,240
Hui,

112
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,920
it's up to you

113
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,960
to stay or to leave.

114
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,240
Nowadays, the kids

115
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,320
are immature.

116
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,320
Don't be mad.

117
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,880
My temper was worse than him.

118
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,760
Don't try to comfort me.

119
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,800
How do you know Hui?

120
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,120
Do you remember, once I told you

121
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,680
that I saved someone?

122
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,360
He is the...

123
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,040
I didn't expect such a coincidence.

124
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:32,960
Should we

125
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,600
tell Mischief Man about that?

126
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,880
We'd better not.

127
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,640
After he quarreled with Hui,

128
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,360
he didn't even step out of his room.

129
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,600
He didn't even eat his dinner

130
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,920
even though Quan brought it to him.

131
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,040
We can't tell him that.

132
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,560
Hello, Siqi.

133
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,880
What's wrong?

134
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,840
Quan.

135
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,200
What happened between

136
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,520
Mischief Man and Hui?

137
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,200
When Hui was 18 years old,

138
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,160
his mother passed away
due to a heart attack.

139
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,000
Since then,

140
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,360
Hui has never been on a good term
with Mr. Xu.

141
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,000
What does this have to do
with Mischief Man?

142
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,200
How should I put this?

143
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,240
Back then,

144
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,600
Mr. Xu was busy
with the Chamber of Commerce's matter.

145
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,080
He may have

146
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,040
neglected Mrs. Xu and Hui.

147
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,040
Mrs. Xu was lonely

148
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,440
which then led to depression.

149
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,760
And no one knew that

150
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,080
Mrs. Xu had a heart problem.

151
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,600
When Mrs. Xu was sick,

152
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,560
Mr. Xu was working on
an important business.

153
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,800
When he finally got back home

154
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,720
and sent Mrs. Xu to the hospital,

155
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,120
Mrs. Xu was already gone.

156
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,560
So Hui thought

157
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,920
that Mrs. Xu passed away because

158
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,320
she wasn't sent to the hospital on time.

159
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,840
But both of us know

160
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,680
that it's very unlikely

161
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,520
to save a heart attack patient.

162
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:17,400
But Hui didn't want to acknowledge this.

163
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,400
Actually, I can understand Hui.

164
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,840
A heart that's filled not with love,

165
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,120
but hate,

166
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,920
is still better than an empty heart.

167
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,840
The same goes for Mr. Xu.

168
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:32,480
He might be smiling all day.

169
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,320
But deep inside,

170
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,080
the wound is still bleeding.

171
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,360
If it's a misunderstanding,

172
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,240
it'll be resolved someday.

173
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,240
I hope so too.

174
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,400
Siqi.

175
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,560
I brought you breakfast, Siqi.

176
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,320
Si...

177
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,040
Hi, Antonia.

178
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:20,880
Where is Kiki?

179
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,160
She is not working here anymore.

180
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,520
She is not working here.

181
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,600
No.

182
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,000
Okay, thanks.

183
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,400
No problem.

184
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,120
Hey, Jack.

185
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,920
Hey, Ben.

186
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,600
Is Kiki not working here?

187
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,680
Yeah, she quit.

188
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,080
What?

189
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,680
Do you know where she goes?

190
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,960
No. Sorry, I have no idea.

191
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,280
Okay, thanks.

192
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,920
This is Zhen.

193
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,480
My lover.

194
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,520
[Wang Yazhen]
Hui's mother.

195
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:04,360
Zhen.

196
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,680
I have two new friends with me today.

197
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,640
This girl.

198
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,800
Her surname is Xia, Xia Yuan.

199
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:16,120
This boy is Hao Weilai.

200
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,680
I call him Mischief Boy.

201
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,400
You're gonna love them.

202
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,000
These days,

203
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,160
they have been spending time with me.

204
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,520
I feel like I'm getting younger now.

205
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:35,280
When I first met Mischief Man
in the police station,

206
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,760
he was so powerful.

207
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,280
But, what happened yesterday

208
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,200
just made him look so pitiful.

209
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,960
Like a lonely old man.

210
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,720
Xia Yuan.

211
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,720
Didn't you save Hui?

212
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,960
Go talk to him.

213
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,480
I talked to him once.

214
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,760
I didn't mention Mr. Xu.

215
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,280
He didn't ask too.

216
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,600
That's what makes

217
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,040
the conversation go along naturally.

218
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,960
I think Hui

219
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,200
is a kind-hearted person.

220
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,400
But I haven't found the right time yet.

221
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,800
Let's wait until we find
the right moment.

222
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,040
I feel like

223
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,160
I can understand Hui's feelings.

224
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,720
Mischief Man is similar to my dad.

225
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,520
I always see my dad as someone

226
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,680
who is selfish and cruel.

227
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,560
And then I get to know Mischief Man,

228
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:26,320
I can see my father in him.

229
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,640
My dad never yield.

230
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,240
But...

231
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,640
What if he's lonely like Mischief Man

232
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,400
when he is alone?

233
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,560
Hao Weilai.

234
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,480
Are you abandoning me?

235
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:48,160
What are you talking about?

236
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,240
Speak human language.

237
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:51,880
Weilai,

238
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,680
I've been thinking about it a lot.

239
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,320
I really don't know

240
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,560
why Siqi left me.

241
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,360
She...

242
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:58,360
Did you do something wrong

243
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,760
and upset her?

244
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,480
I don't know what did I do wrong.

245
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,760
I'm wrong all the time.

246
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,360
Think about it.

247
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,080
She didn't run away

248
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,040
when you were pestering her.

249
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,360
This time, she just left.

250
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,840
There's got to be a reason.

251
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,800
Why don't you go talk to her?

252
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,440
Talk to her?

253
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,040
How do I talk to her?

254
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,480
She left so abruptly.

255
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,880
Where can I find her?

256
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,840
You tell me.

257
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,040
I don't know.

258
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,640
Minimum height, 1.78m.

259
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,680
Fluent in English, Japanese,

260
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:51,320
German, French,

261
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,280
and Russian.

262
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,480
Must be able to play piano,

263
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,880
dance, and drum.

264
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:12,680
Required to work full month
without off day.

265
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,840
Ye Siqi,

266
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,400
you're the best!

267
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,480
You can do this.

268
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,320
Let's go, let's go!

269
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,800
How is Qiao Bin?

270
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,480
Is he crying again?

271
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,600
Let him be.

272
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,880
He's always like this.

273
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,080
Xia Yuan.

274
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,680
You know where is Ye Siqi, don't you?

275
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,880
Yuan, I'm planning to leave the beach.

276
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,640
Why?

277
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,640
Qiao Bin is dating Sophia.

278
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,120
I hope they can be happy together.

279
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,200
Qiao Bin didn't tell you

280
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,320
about things between him and Sophia?

281
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,160
No.

282
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,320
If what you are saying is true,

283
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,440
then Qiao Bin asked for it.

284
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,920
How could he have someone in his mind,

285
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:18,840
but pestering with another one?

286
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,400
Actually, Siqi

287
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,480
always supports Qiao Bin

288
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,040
in pursuing happiness.

289
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:25,040
And she knows

290
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:25,960
that there is a clash

291
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,680
between both of them.

292
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,240
That's why she has been
rejecting Qiao Bin

293
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,640
when he came to Europe.

294
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,840
Sophia

295
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,600
is kind of a turning point
for the three of them.

296
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,520
Well, he can't have them both.

297
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,240
That's why

298
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,120
Siqi decided to leave.

299
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,400
On the one hand,

300
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,440
she wishes Qiao Bin and Sophia
nothing but happiness;

301
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,120
On the other hand, she thinks

302
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,240
that she should get a job.

303
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,120
Fine.

304
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,480
I hope they figure it out soon.

305
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,120
It's getting late.

306
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,440
Go to bed earlier.

307
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,400
I'll leave now.

308
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,080
Recruiting Chinese.

309
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:49,840
It's you, then.

310
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,040
[15 Street Flats 1-23]

311
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,760
Come in.

312
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,880
Have a seat.

313
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,760
The interview will start soon.

314
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,360
Excuse me.

315
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,880
You are recruiting
for an assistant, right?

316
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:18,680
Not a beauty pageant, right?

317
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,480
We are recruiting for an assistant.

318
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,320
Have a seat.

319
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,440
Thanks.

320
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,640
Nine circle.

321
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:50,960
Boss.

322
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,840
You're in luck today.

323
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,360
You won two games in a row.

324
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:55,800
It's not about luck.

325
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,560
It's just that I'm good at it.

326
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,280
Two character.

327
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,960
Watch me.

328
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:07,960
Three circle.

329
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:08,960
I win.

330
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,160
You're amazing, Mischief Man.

331
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,920
You are only awaiting three circle
and you got it.

332
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,320
You're so lucky.

333
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,240
This is nothing.

334
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,240
Well, I'm just too good at this.

335
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,720
It's you!

336
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,040
It's you.

337
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,280
Thanks to you when I was at the beach.

338
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,600
I haven't thanked you.

339
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,640
Nothing. Don't mention it.

340
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,760
Saving a life is better than
building a seven-level pagoda.

341
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:55,960
Oh.

342
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,000
Do you feel better?

343
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,200
Yes.

344
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,160
Good to know.

345
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,040
Are you here to apply for a job too?

346
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,040
Let me guess.

347
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,160
Are you attracted by

348
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,480
the high pay?

349
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,880
But did you

350
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,240
read the requirements?

351
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,680
It is stated
that they only recruit females

352
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,240
and there's an age restriction.

353
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,200
Is it?

354
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,160
I might have missed it.

355
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,280
But it's okay.

356
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,040
Just take it as an experience.

357
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,240
This is the first time
I've seen such a beautiful villa.

358
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,480
But,

359
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,280
I'm quite nervous now.

360
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,480
Why?

361
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,360
Look.

362
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,000
It's all girls.

363
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:34,160
I thought this was a beauty pageant.

364
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,280
See.

365
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,200
The assistant hiring post
might be a cover,

366
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,200
maybe the boss...

367
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,120
Hey!

368
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,880
Where is he?

369
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:51,360
Amitabha. Amitabha.

370
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:56,600
Go!

371
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:57,360
Pong!

372
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,440
You can only Pong.

373
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,840
Don't try to take the tiles
from all three players.

374
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:01,600
Don't worry.

375
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,280
Two character.

376
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,120
Pong.

377
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,560
Three bamboo.

378
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,680
Wait.

379
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,280
Pong.

380
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:11,680
So many Pong.

381
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,240
Are you letting us play?

382
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,880
Well, I have to.

383
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,840
Fine, go on.

384
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,720
Continue.

385
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,560
Four circle.

386
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,240
Pong!

387
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:19,840
I have.

388
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,560
Look, now he gets to pong.

389
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,360
He's happy.

390
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,320
Six bamboo.

391
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,280
Wait.

392
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,160
Pure hand

393
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,400
in sequence.

394
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,200
Boss.

395
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,000
There is your opponent on the left.

396
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,800
Six bamboo. I'm cutting in.

397
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,560
You...

398
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:54,680
Fine.

399
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,040
Alright.

400
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,440
Mr. Xu.

401
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,040
What's with the panic?

402
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,560
Young... Young Master.

403
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,000
Who?

404
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,400
Hui.

405
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,360
Xia Yuan.

406
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,760
I'm delivering your order.

407
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,960
Please come.

408
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,720
I... Mr. Xu,

409
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,880
I'll be right back.

410
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:25,560
Okay.

411
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,240
I'll check it out.

412
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,320
Miss,

413
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,200
please follow me.

414
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,400
Am I the first one?

415
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,120
Yes.

416
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,000
Please.

417
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,240
Go.

418
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,320
Hi.

419
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,800
I'm Ye Siqi.

420
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,880
This is my resume.

421
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:19,880
Let's start.

422
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,800
Introduce yourself.

423
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,400
Hi, I'm Ye Siqi.

424
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,040
I'm from China.

425
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,400
When I got to Europe,

426
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,840
I worked on farms and beaches.

427
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,160
I picked apples.

428
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,000
I have experience
selling fish and chips.

429
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,640
I am

430
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,760
an optimistic, positive,

431
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,440
and bubbly person.

432
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,440
I'm looking forward

433
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:48,800
to learning more.

434
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,040
In your opinion,

435
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,760
what qualities should

436
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,600
a personal assistant have?

437
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,480
Qualities?

438
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,920
Qualities...

439
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,680
She needs

440
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,840
to be professional.

441
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,520
She needs

442
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,520
to complete the tasks on time.

443
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,600
And she needs

444
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,640
to have a good communication skill

445
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,000
and

446
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,600
psychological quality.

447
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,560
And...

448
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,520
Enough.

449
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,600
Do you have relevant work experience?

450
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,000
No.

451
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,360
But I'm willing to learn.

452
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,640
What makes you think

453
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,240
I'd hire a newbie like you

454
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,200
over the experienced one?

455
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,280
Because

456
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,960
the possibilities are endless for me.

457
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,440
I'm a piece of blank paper.

458
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,560
I can be

459
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,960
what you want me to be.

460
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,640
Oh, it's you!

461
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,880
Hello again.

462
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,440
Look.

463
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,240
It's all girls.

464
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,520
I thought this was a beauty pageant.

465
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,000
See.

466
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,960
The assistant hiring post

467
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,040
might be a cover,

468
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,720
maybe the boss...

469
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:09,960
Strength.

470
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,080
Good personality.

471
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,080
Fast learner.

472
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,680
Talented.

473
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,800
This is the first time

474
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,680
I know a "good personality"
can be one of the strengths.

475
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:20,800
Ever since I was a kid,

476
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,720
people praised me
for my good personality.

477
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,840
I guess it counted

478
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,880
as a strength.

479
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,360
Amazing!

480
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,200
Ye Siqi, you are amazing!

481
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:42,960
Amazing!

482
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,440
Amitabha. Amitabha.

483
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,360
Good things happen to good people.

484
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,800
Cheese.

485
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,200
Boss, it's been taken care of.

486
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,720
Thank you.

487
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,600
It's a long day.

488
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,560
Do you want me

489
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,920
to do a background check
on Miss. Ye Siqi?

490
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,520
No need.

491
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,920
After all, she is a stranger.

492
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,800
It's better to be cautious.

493
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,080
I believe her.

494
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,240
Enjoy.

495
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,080
I have to leave to deal with some stuff.

496
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,480
Yuan.

497
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,760
You saved my life.

498
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,520
I haven't thanked you formally.

499
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,480
These are Western foods.

500
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,040
Next time,
if you want to eat Chinese food,

501
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,880
you have to come to my restaurant.

502
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:45,960
Hui.

503
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,160
That's a lot of food.

504
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,600
Why don't we get

505
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,040
Mr. Xu and the others to eat too?

506
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,360
No need.

507
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,840
I made these just for you.

508
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,120
If you like them,

509
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,520
I can send them to you every day.

510
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,040
No need.

511
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,640
Operating the restaurant
is tiring enough.

512
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:02,800
Don't trouble yourself.

513
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:03,960
It's not.

514
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,280
As long as you like it.

515
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,680
Let me peel the prawns for you.

516
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,200
You...

517
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:11,760
No need.

518
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,720
I... I can do it myself.

519
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:14,840
It's okay.

520
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:21,520
Eat.

521
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,680
Yuan, try this.

522
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,440
Let's eat.

523
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,760
Give it a taste.

524
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,280
Is it good?

525
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,680
It's good.

526
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,600
Yuan.

527
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,160
Actually, after that incident,

528
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,320
I don't really think about my matter.

529
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,720
But I thought of you often.

530
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,440
When I thought of you
risking your life to save me,

531
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,360
I don't know
if I'm causing you any trouble.

532
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,040
Not at all.

533
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:49,560
Don't worry about me.

534
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,080
Good to hear that.

535
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,240
Actually, since then,

536
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,000
I've been wanting to look for you.

537
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:56,680
But I think

538
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,960
I should come back as a better person.

539
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,680
So I went to your workplace

540
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,480
after quite some time.

541
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,120
When I went there, it was closed down.

542
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:06,880
But luckily,

543
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,360
I get to meet you here.

544
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:11,960
Talking to you the other day,

545
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,080
I think

546
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,560
we are quite in sync.

547
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,520
To me,

548
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:18,360
you're not just someone
who saved my life,

549
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,080
but a friend I cherish.

550
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,960
Hui.

551
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,640
You're my best friend too.

552
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:26,720
Yuan.

553
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,160
Can I ask

554
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:29,560
if you have a boyfriend?

555
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,640
Hui.

556
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:42,760
Here's the thing.

557
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,600
I don't have a boyfriend now.

558
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,200
But...

559
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,400
There's no but about it!

560
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,800
Then I can pursue you with confidence.

561
00:28:50,360 --> 00:28:51,360
Hui...

562
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,000
- I...
- Yuan, eat.

563
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:54,920
I...

564
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,920
This is a premium beef.

565
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,040
The prawn.

566
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,000
I went to the market
early in the morning for the prawn.

567
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,440
It's fresh.

568
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:19,720
Hui.

569
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,040
Come in.

570
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,640
What is it?

571
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,880
How is it?

572
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:49,760
I've created the perfect moment

573
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,960
for you and Hui, right?

574
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,680
It's okay.

575
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,880
Don't worry about it.

576
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,160
Take your time.

577
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,600
Do you have something?

578
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,240
No.

579
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,480
You mentioned that the coffee beans

580
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,400
are not fresh.

581
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,000
I'll get you some tomorrow.

582
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,440
No need.

583
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,960
Quan got me some.

584
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,560
Then...

585
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,960
Let's go to the vineyard tomorrow.

586
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:23,440
Are you okay?

587
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,120
Tomorrow is the rest day.

588
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,760
How could you forget that?

589
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:28,480
I didn't realize a lazy person like you

590
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,160
would forget about it.

591
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,240
Are you hot?

592
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,400
A bit.

593
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,840
The air conditioning

594
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:41,560
is not on.

595
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,600
It's on.

596
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,520
I've set it at 18 degrees.

597
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,880
Xia Yuan.

598
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,640
I...

599
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,800
You know I'm timid.

600
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,120
Everyone knows.

601
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:00,920
But there's something

602
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,640
I have to tell you.

603
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:04,960
Say it.

604
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,560
I mean...

605
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,560
It's my parents. Video call.

606
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:13,160
Wait. I have something important
to tell you.

607
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,400
My parents are more important than you.

608
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,680
What if they have an emergency?

609
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,280
They are old.

610
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:19,160
Mum.

611
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,080
Yuan.

612
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,960
How are you recently?

613
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,240
Why did you stop posting on Moments?

614
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:24,720
Then I...

615
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:25,600
- I'll leave first.
- We

616
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,000
don't know what are you doing lately.

617
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,440
I've been a little busy lately.

618
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,760
What are you doing? Have you eaten?

619
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,760
Yes, we did.

620
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:34,360
Show me. What did you eat?

621
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,680
Look. Crayfishes.

622
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,080
Mum, you are wearing new clothes.

623
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:37,920
When did you buy it?

624
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,080
Is it nice?

625
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,200
Hello.

626
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,360
Hi, Boss.

627
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,520
You're here.

628
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,040
What time is it?

629
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,440
Ten.

630
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,240
What time did I tell you to come in?

631
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,520
Ni... Nine.

632
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,960
Listen.

633
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,400
Don't think that you can do as you wish

634
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,960
just because you saved my life.

635
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,600
No, that's not true.

636
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,400
It's just that there's a bit of traffic.

637
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,880
I overslept.

638
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,720
Boss, this is for you.

639
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:48,440
Consider it an apology.

640
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,600
Come in.

641
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,120
Close the door.

642
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,120
When I came for the interview,

643
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:14,640
I didn't realize

644
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,320
that your house was so empty.

645
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,840
Boss, your house is big.

646
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,840
Why don't you put more stuff in here?

647
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,760
Such a waste of space.

648
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,640
I like to keep it simple.

649
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,600
Listen.

650
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,000
This is a public area.

651
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,560
You can walk around.

652
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,120
As for the locked rooms,

653
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,520
you better not go in there.

654
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:38,080
Wait, let me write in my notebook.

655
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:43,080
I don't like people
messing with my stuff.

656
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,600
Okay.

657
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,720
The study is on the second floor.

658
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,480
I'll buy new books every month.

659
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,880
If you want to read it,

660
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,960
feel free to take it.

661
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:50,800
But remember

662
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,720
to put it back in its original position.

663
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,000
No need.

664
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,600
I don't read.

665
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,920
Follow me.

666
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,840
This is the dining room and kitchen.

667
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:07,600
You can put your food

668
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,120
in the empty space in the fridge.

669
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,360
But do not mix it with my food.

670
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,000
Okay.

671
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,320
Can you cook?

672
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,160
I can,

673
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,880
but can't guarantee if it's edible.

674
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,520
Fine.

675
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,680
If you need,

676
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,120
I can get you a delivery
from the restaurant.

677
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,200
But breakfast is on your own.

678
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,440
No problem.

679
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:28,200
I wake up at 6 AM to exercise

680
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,560
and breakfast at 7 AM.

681
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,200
So, I hope you can finish your breakfast

682
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:32,560
before 7 AM.

683
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,880
Also, clean every corner of the house.

684
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,840
So early.

685
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,680
You can exercise with me.

686
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,240
No, no thanks.

687
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:41,760
Thanks for asking.

688
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,520
What did I just say to you?

689
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,120
I'm sorry.

690
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,200
I'm sorry, Boss.

691
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,440
I won't do it again.

692
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,960
Boss, is this my room?

693
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,040
Thank you, Boss!

694
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,800
You're welcome.

695
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,360
The bedding is new.

696
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,200
Let me know if you need anything.

697
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:37,840
So, that is

698
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,840
basically it.

699
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,640
You'll start work tomorrow.

700
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,240
Yes, sir!

701
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,600
Boss.

702
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,720
Where is the butler?

703
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,000
I haven't seen him since.

704
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:51,800
He is not here.

705
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,320
Not here?

706
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,440
Is he fired?

707
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,720
Wait a minute.

708
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,720
There are only two of us

709
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,480
in such a big house?

710
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,360
Yes.

711
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,320
My butler

712
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,760
resigned due to personal reasons.

713
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:14,680
That's why I'm looking for an assistant.

714
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:15,520
Also,

715
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,720
I don't like too many people
in my house.

716
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,120
You don't need to be afraid.

717
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,360
We have a contract.

718
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,920
I'll be a good boss.

719
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,280
I hope you will be a good staff too.

720
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,560
Get some rest.

721
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:28,120
You'll start working tomorrow.

722
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,520
Boss.

723
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,880
Where are your family?

724
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,200
Don't your wife live with you?

725
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,680
I'm not married.

726
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,080
Oh,

727
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,560
if you're afraid,

728
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,200
you can lock the door.

729
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,840
A new life

730
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,200
[Sent]
is starting.

731
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,120
What are you looking at?

732
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:35,480
I'm looking

733
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,320
at the wine from our vineyard.

734
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,520
These were made in recent years.

735
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,160
If you want to take a look,

736
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,920
let Quan show you to the wine cellar.

737
00:37:46,920 --> 00:37:48,000
Alright.

738
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:52,080
Why did you come to me last night?

739
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,800
Nothing.

740
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,600
It's just...

741
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,720
After Siqi left,

742
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:03,080
Qiao Bin

743
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,120
felt lost.

744
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,680
He's not doing good.

745
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,160
So?

746
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,200
Didn't we talk about this already?

747
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,120
Qiao Bin needs to be independent.

748
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,360
After all, he is my best buddy.

749
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,720
Should I go talk to him

750
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,240
or comfort him?

751
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,040
Comfort?

752
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:22,040
What you can do now is only talk.

753
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,920
It doesn't really help.

754
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,720
Might as well leave him alone.

755
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,280
Let him think about it.

756
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,280
Furthermore,

757
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,160
there is

758
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,560
Sophia at the beach.

759
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,000
Fine.

760
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,120
Mr. Xu.

761
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:39,960
Here you are.

762
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,720
Mischief Man, why are you here?

763
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,640
I

764
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,600
have some questions for Xia.

765
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:46,560
Xia, come with me.

766
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,200
Xia,

767
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,600
you're friends with Hui.

768
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,680
I didn't know

769
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,320
Hui was your son.

770
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,800
Hui

771
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,800
never talks about me.

772
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:22,080
How did you two meet?

773
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,800
It's a long story.

774
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:27,920
Can you tell me more about it?

775
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,040
I'm surprised

776
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,880
he is so close to you.

777
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:32,960
I'm sorry.

778
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,040
I'm just curious.

779
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,520
When I first met Hui,

780
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,280
he was in a bad mood.

781
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,400
He was impulsive

782
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,760
and desperate.

783
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,920
He had suicidal thoughts.

784
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,720
I talked to him for a very long time

785
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:53,040
to calm him down.

786
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,880
Hui is always like this.

787
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,000
He kept everything in his heart.

788
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,960
What pushed him

789
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,800
to this extent?

790
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,720
Mr. Xu,

791
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,080
don't overthink.

792
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,640
It's already over.

793
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:12,080
I talked to Hui a few times later.

794
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,480
Deep down, I think

795
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,160
he still loves life.

796
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,080
It was probably an impulsive thought.

797
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,560
He promised me

798
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,160
that he won't do that again.

799
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,840
And,

800
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,880
I think he is willing to come back here.

801
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,840
When we were at his restaurant,

802
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,080
he told me a lot of things

803
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,720
about the vineyard.

804
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,320
Really?

805
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,720
Yeah.

806
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,480
No matter what,

807
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,680
this place will always be his home.

808
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,040
You'll always be his father.

809
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:41,520
One day, the misunderstanding

810
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,200
will be resolved.

811
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:46,400
Mr. Xu,

812
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,560
the most important thing for now

813
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,880
is to take care of your health.

814
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,720
We've got a long way to go.

815
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,080
Okay.

816
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,600
Alright.

817
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,720
Xia.

818
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,160
Please, can you

819
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:06,160
talk to Hui?

820
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,520
I don't know any friends of his.

821
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,840
Biao talked to him previously.

822
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:12,840
But he chased him away.

823
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,720
He has been avoiding me.

824
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,120
We can't even talk to each other now.

825
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,240
Please, help me.

826
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,680
I will, Mr. Xu.

827
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,560
I'll talk to him.

828
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,120
Hui and I

829
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,600
are best friends.

830
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,360
Great.

831
00:41:58,920 --> 00:41:59,920
You!

832
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:01,440
Problem?

833
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,600
Apologize!

834
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:03,480
Apologize!

835
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,240
Sorry, sorry!

836
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,280
He is my boyfriend.

837
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:06,280
He is drunk.

838
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:07,560
I'm sorry.

839
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,280
