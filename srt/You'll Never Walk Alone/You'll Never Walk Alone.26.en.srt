Create a brand?

25
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,600
Yes.

26
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,480
But the factory is now

27
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,360
in its most difficult time.

28
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,560
What we should do

29
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,400
is to help the factory to
tide over the difficulties

30
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,000
and not to take any risks

31
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,720
at this time,

32
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,520
right?

33
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,960
It's risky to create a brand,

34
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,240
but we don't have any orders now.

35
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,240
In that case,

36
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,760
we might as well find another way

37
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,480
in which to create our own brand

38
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,320
so that we can revitalize the factory.

39
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:41,960
Weilai,

40
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,080
there is a lot of difficulty

41
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,360
in implementing your idea.

42
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,160
First of all, it takes a lot of money

43
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,520
to build a brand from scratch,

44
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,720
and we don't have that much money.

45
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:56,640
Secondly, the most important thing

46
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,440
about original designs is the design.

47
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,360
Can we find a reliable designer?

48
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,080
Where can we find one now?

49
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,360
We don't know.

50
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,840
Even if we find one now,

51
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,920
we can't afford to hire him.

52
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,800
You don't have to worry about the money.

53
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:11,720
I've shut down my studio

54
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,960
and pulled all my money out

55
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,480
to put it into the production line.

56
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,880
If there's a need for a designer,

57
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,400
I'm already looking for one.

58
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,680
I've been in this industry

59
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,080
for decades,

60
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,040
and I've seen too many
transformations fail.

61
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,960
Have you thought this through?

62
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:28,720
Mr. Ge,

63
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,320
are we not failing

64
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,640
if we don't transform?

65
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,520
We're still failing now.

66
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,200
I looked into the data

67
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,800
in the market over the past few years.

68
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,600
All the home furniture brands

69
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,120
and independent innovation brands

70
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,720
have taken up a higher
proportion in the market.

71
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,000
Only if we make our brand famous

72
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,600
can we attract more clients.

73
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,880
Weilai,

74
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,200
you need to think this through.

75
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,200
Once we commit to
creating our own brand,

76
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,520
we'll have to start from scratch.

77
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,680
I can only get in touch with

78
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,760
OEM clients at the moment.

79
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,440
I don't know

80
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,000
where to find clients who can accept

81
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,440
our original products.

82
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,800
Have you thought about

83
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,040
the distribution channels?

84
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,960
I've thought about it.

85
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,160
It's the age of the Internet now.

86
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,440
We can do online sales.

87
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,600
We can't stick to
the traditional sales model.

88
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,760
I think your idea is too risky.

89

Mr. Hao, what do you think?

90
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,040

Is she resigning?

95
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,320
I don't think that's possible.

96
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,400
- Hi, Ms. An.
- Hi, Ms. An.

97
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,960
Hasn't Xia Yuan come to work yet?

98
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,480
I don't think she has the face to come.

99
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,600
She's an assistant director,

100
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,760
but she's not even on time for meetings,

101
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:14,560
and spreading the word that the
company's setting up a new department.

102
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,000
What new department?

103
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,200
I think she dreamt it up.

104
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,680
You're right.

105
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,440
You guys just

106
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,920
work with me and keep up the good work.

107
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,480
Now that the position
of Assistant Director

108
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,960
is vacant,

109
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,200
it's time to see
which one of you works harder.

110
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,080
- We'll do our best.
- Yes.

111
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,760
I'll see how you do.

112
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,320
- I got it.
- I'll get back to work now.

113
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:45,440
Weilai,

114
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,120
I don't agree with that either.

115
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:47,960
Why?

116
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,080
That's too risky.

117
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,280
Weilai,

118
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,120
Mr Ge and I have been

00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,240
in this industry for decades.

120
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,160
You're just starting out.

121
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,360
I know

122
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,280
you're doing everything
for the sake of the factory,

123
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,120
but you're too impatient.

124
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,440
Given the state of our factory,

125
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,680
we can only make steady progress.

126
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,680
At my age,

127
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,800
I don't want to take any risks.

128
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,200
Dad, I understand you.

129
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,880
But there's still me.

130
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:20,680
I'm still young.

131
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,920
I'll take the risk.

132
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,280
I can take all the responsibility.

133
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,920
How can you take the responsibility?

134
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,160
Weilai,

135
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,400
this old school mate
I've been in touch with

136
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,560
is interested in working with me.

137
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,680
If this contract is signed,

138
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,280
we can

139
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,720
feel relieved for a while.

140
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,560
And you

141
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,200
can do whatever you like.

142
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,840
What if the contract is not signed?

143
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,520
What if we don't have this order?

144
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,840
What should we do?

145
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,360
Even if we get this order,

146
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,800
we're still being led around by others.

147
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,920
We can only feed ourselves

a detailed proposal to show you.

151
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,040
I get it.

152
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,720
Even if I don't agree,

153
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,880
you'll still do it.

154

Xia Yuan, please help me with this.

155

I don't really understand.

156
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,320
Let me take a look.

157
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,640
This one.

158
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:33,520
Okay.

and send me
a detailed statistical report.

162
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,960
Ms. An, do you need it in a hurry?

163
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,120
I told you to sort it out
by the end of the day.

164
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,640
Don't you understand?

165
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,880
Ms. An, after looking through the files,

166
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,840
which are several years old,

167
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:31,920
these have been confirmed to be archived

168
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,160
without any problems.

169
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:34,200
I don't see

170
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,360
why we should waste our time

171
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,120
on this unnecessary work.

172
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,920
If I tell you to sort it out now,

173
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:39,880
just do it.

174
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,400
Cut the crap.

175
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,400
Ms. Xia, you're still capable

176
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,600
to do that, right?

177
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,240
Okay.

178
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,760
I'll get it done.

179
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,880
Very good.

180
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,640
What's it?

181
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:12,680
Ms. An,

182
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,080
I've sorted out the files

183
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,400
you asked me to.

184
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,400
Very good.

185
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:17,960
Ms. An,

186
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,880
I don't see how sorting out

187
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,040
these old archived files

188
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,800
is going to help us in our work.

189
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,280
It's none of your business.

190
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,640
I have my own arrangements.

191
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:27,800
All you have to do

192
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,880
is obey.

193
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,520
I'll do whatever you want me to do.

194
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,200
But since I started working,

195
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:33,840
any task

196
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:36,040
has to have a meaning and a value.

197
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:38,080
What is the value of all this work?

198
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:45,680
Anna,

199
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,160
I really don't understand.

200
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,920
You seem to have changed

201
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,880
since I came back.

202
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,320
Is there a misunderstanding between us?

203
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,360
What kind of misunderstanding
can we have?

204
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,880
Xia Yuan,

205
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,800
it's working hours.

206
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,520
I don't want to talk to you about
anything that isn't work-related.

207
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,840
Anna,

208
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,320
we're the same group of employees
who joined the company together.

209
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,080
We were so close before.

210
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,680
In the company,

211
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,800
you're the only one
I considered a good friend.

212
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,520
Why did we end up like this?

213
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,680
We were close?

214
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,880
Xia Yuan,

215
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,720
do you always

216
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,760
live in your own world?

217
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,440
Can you please accept
the reality of the situation?

218
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,600
I joined the company
at the same time as you.

219
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,320
Why did you get promoted
faster than me every time?

220
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,320
In terms of education,
I have a master's degree,

221
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,520
and in terms of ability,

222
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,640
I got as much business as you did.

223
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,200
Why did you always stay ahead of me?

224
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,800
Xia Yuan, stop pretending.

225
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:54,120
I know what you're thinking right now.

226
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,080
As long as I'm in this company,

227
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,520
you'll never be able
to climb the ladder.

228
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,880
I'll always step on you.

229
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,520
You'll never get a chance
to get back on your feet.

230
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,280
Get out.

231
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,200
Thank you for telling me
what's in your mind today,

232
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,960
Ms. An.

233
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,440
Are you working overtime today?

234
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,400
Yes.

235
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,760
Seriously.

236
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,760
What's wrong with you?

237
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,120
It's a long story.

238
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,960
My dad finally realised now that

239
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,320
I'll do it

240
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,480
even if he doesn't agree with me.

241
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,720
But I still hope

242
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,440
he'll stand by me.

243
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,520
Everything has to be done step by step.

244
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:09,520
The most important thing now is to prove

245
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,480
that you're right.

246
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,920
Right, here you go.

247
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,960
Sandwich.

248
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,600
I made it myself.

249
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:17,960
You made it?

250
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:18,960
Yes.

251
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,800
You're getting better at it now.

252
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:23,560
How's it?

253
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,520
Didn't you say you were aggrieved?

254
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,960
Now you're sitting here
eating sandwiches with me,

255
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,480
aren't you even more aggrieved?

256
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,440
Yeah, I'm so aggrieved.

257
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,560
I'm leaving, then.

258
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:33,720
Don't go.

259
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,120
I was just kidding.

260
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,240
Didn't you tell me

261
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,000
you had something important to do?

262
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:42,880
At first,

263
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,200
I didn't want to be so absolute.

264
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,920
I thought we were all friends.

265
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,280
You know what?

266
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,360
I used to consider

267
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,480
only Anna as my friend in the company.

268
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,880
I didn't expect

269
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,160
that she'd be the one who
treats me the harshest now.

270
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,760
Her behaviour today has made me realise

271
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,240
that forgiving bad people

272
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,040
is punishing myself.

273
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:05,800
They say one step back
gives you a wide headway,

274
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,760
but some people

275
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,240
will take two steps forward
when you take one step back.

276
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,680
Give an inch and they'll take a mile.

277
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,000
We are all human beings
for the first time,

278
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,680
so why should we give in to her, right?

279
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:16,200
I'll give in when I have to,

280
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,480
and I won't back down when I have to.

281
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,440
Dig in now.

282
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,840
You still have to get back to work.

283
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,840
Let's try

284
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,920
what you've added.

285
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:28,000
There are ham,

00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:30,960
and many more.

288
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,040
Is it good? Any improvement?

289
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,560
You've improved a lot.

290
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,800
Wei,

291
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,120
some time ago,

292
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,960
I met a college student from China.

293
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,120
His business idea

294
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,040
is really good

295
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,200
and impressed me.

296
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,120
And he told me

297
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,240
that there are many
young people like him

298
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,400
who want to start
their own business in China.

299
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,280
Because of the lack of capital,

300
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:05,360
many of their ideas stop
at the presentation stage.

301
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,600
I do appreciate these young people,

302
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,240
and I'm willing to support them.

303
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,280
I'm also keeping an eye on
entrepreneurs in China.

304
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,160
After all, we had been through
the early stages of entrepreneurship

305
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,680
and we know how difficult it is.

306
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,560
Have you ever thought
about going back to China?

307
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,800
Although

308
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,840
we have been abroad for a long time,

309
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,320
we often feel

310
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,480
that China is better.

311
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,320
I've thought about it,

312
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:38,840
but I can't make up my mind.

[Suggestions for company development]

314
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,760
I didn't expect Ms. An

315
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,120
to bribe clients

316
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,720
for performance.

317
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,520
That's not the worst of it.

318
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,280
She even made false accounts.

319
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,120
I've heard about it before,

320
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,960
but I didn't expect it to be true.

321
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,880
Ms. An has made
such a big mistake this time,

322
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,880
but Ms. Xia is still in the mood

323
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,960
to write her suggestions to the company.

324
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,560

I admire her, too.

325
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:34,640
I think Ms. An

326
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,280
will be severely punished.

327
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,680
Yeah.

What should we do, then?

I...

00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,600
If Xia Yuan takes over as director,

00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,760
we'll...

Here's my letter of resignation.

337
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,520
Xia Yuan,

338
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,360
you're a veteran of the company,

339
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,560
and you're one of the best.

340
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,360
As the management of the company,

341
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,720
I can't see the company losing

342
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,360
a talent like you.

343
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,200
I know

344
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,720
you've just returned to China

00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,040

But it's okay.

00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,200
I'll adjust it slowly.

349
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,480
It's all right.

350
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,080
I've decided to resign.

00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,640
You'd better behave yourself.

373
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:22,720
What have I done?

374
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,440
Make it clear!

375
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,720
You... What are you doing?

376
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,680
What are you doing?

377
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:26,560
Did you two do something

378
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,040
behind my back?

379
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:27,880
Stop spouting nonsense.

380
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,280
Why are you making a scene?

381
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,680
Listen here.

382
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,080
I know about all the things you've done.

383
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:32,840
Tang,

384
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,320
we're married.

385
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:34,920
I know.

386
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,480
You need to know who you are now.

387
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:37,400
Who am I?

388
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,200
How dare you flirt with women
behind my back?

389
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,920
I'm the boss of this company.

390
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,920
You're great, huh?

391
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,440
What's wrong with me?
Tell me what's wrong with me.

392
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,520
Are you having an affair with her?

393
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,360
Listen here,

394
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,560
I've had enough of you.

395
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,800
- I've had enough.
- Make it clear.

396
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:48,520
Xia Yuan.

397
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,080
Tang, stand there.

398
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,400
You never change.

399
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,040
Let's see how I'm going
to deal with you.

400
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,640
Who knows?

401
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,480
This is too exciting, isn't it?

402
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,120
How are you?

403
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,760
Adapting well to the new company?

404
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,320
I'm used to being at home

405
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,680
in the studio.

406
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,400
I'm not used to crowds.

407
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,360
You'll soon get used to it.

408
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,600
You're a slow starter.

409
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,920
How about Bai and Qiang?

410
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,880
They both joined the same company.

411
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,880
They're pretty busy.

412
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,000
Boss,

413
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,320
You need a designer

414
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,080
to design your own brand.

415
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,760
I designed a bunch
of furniture in college.

416
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,520
I can send you the drawings.

417
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:35,520
Okay.

418
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,320
Send them to me.

419
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,360
Boss, if there's anything that
you need help with, just tell me.

420
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,160
I've got your number

421
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,960
saved as an important contact.

422
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,000
Your calls ring differently.

423
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,320
You're so cute.

424
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,960
Xia Yuan,

425
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,680
this is Monkey.

426
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,520
This is my girlfriend, Xia Yuan.

427
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,120
Hi, Lady Boss.

428
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,160
Hi, Monkey.

429
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,640
Well, Boss, I'll get going now.

430
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,400
Okay.

431
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,560
- Bye.
- Bye.

432
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:09,680
Bye.

433
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,480
Sit down.

434
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,280
What would you like to drink?

435
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,080
Drink mine.

436
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,680
Come on.

437
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,520
Why are you here at this hour?

438
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,000
Not working?

439
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,840
I resigned.

440
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,920
Resigned?

441
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,720
I couldn't stand

442
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,360
the couple's dirty tricks anymore

443
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,640
so I resigned.

444
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,720
Oh, no.

445
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,920
What's wrong?

446
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,120
You can't support me.

447
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,000
It seems I have to support you.

448
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,960
Tell me your bank card number
and password.

449
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,600
So mean?

450
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,480
I'm a jobless man now.

451
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:03,720
Your phone is ringing.

452
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,120
Hello, Siqi. What's it?

453
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,120
Really?

454
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,480
Okay.

455
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,680
Wait for us at home.

456
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,040
We'll go back later.

457
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,560
Okay. Bye.

458
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,520
Ye Siqi and Mr. Wei
have returned to China.

459
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,560
What's that look?

460
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,560
Apron.

461
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,040
You're such a lovey-dovey couple.

462
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,560
That means we were made for each other.

463
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,880
Siqi,

464
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,280
are you tired

465
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,040
from the long flight and preparing

466
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:55,800
so much food?

467
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,040
I'm fine.

468
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:59,560
But my man is a bit sleepy.

469
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,160
Have some light food

470
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,520
and go to rest.

471
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:03,800
Yes, Madam.

472
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,080
You're screwed.

473
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:06,600
You're getting childish now.

474
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:09,560
What childish?

475
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,240
This is cute.

476
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,480
Yuan,

477
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,400
you have such a high emotional quotient,

478
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,960
how come Hao Weilai
hasn't improved at all?

479
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,560
You should do something about him.

480
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,200
I can't,

481
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,440
and I don't dare to.

482
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,120
You're just going to leave me alone?

483
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,440
Don't leave me alone, please.

484
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,920
Learning to be self-disciplined.

485
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:27,840
Self-disciplined?

486
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:28,880
What's self-disciplined? I don't know.

487
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,760
Grow up.

488
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,320
Don't leave me alone.

489
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:32,960
All right.

490
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,840
Dig in.

491
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,800
It's all cooked.

492
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,200
Do you miss your friend?

493
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,560
A little bit.

494
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,320
But they have their happiness,

495
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,720
and I have mine.

496
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,160
Ignore them.

497
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,520
Let's get on with it.

498
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,000
I can't believe I can't master it.

499
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,000
Here you go.

500
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,840
Come on,

501
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,200
let me say a few words.

502
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,320
First of all,

503
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,720
it's great to see you back
together in Shanghai.

504
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,320
I've invited you to dinner

505
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,600
because you're

506
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,360
Siqi's closest friends,

507
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,680
especially Xia Yuan.

508
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:13,880
Siqi told me

509
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,600
that you're like a real sister to her.

510
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,680
Thank you for taking care of her.

511
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,240
All right, Sir.

512
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,560
You make it sound like
a leader's speech.

513
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,240
We're having hot pot at home.

514
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,840
It's all about relaxation.

515
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,280
It's good to be back in the homeland.

516
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,680
Familiar ingredients,
familiar surroundings

517
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,040
and most of all, familiar friends.

518
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,000
Sir,

519
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,840
we made a very wise decision

520
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,280
to return to our homeland.

521
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:38,520
That's right.

522
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,920
Come on, cheers!

523
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,360
Come on.

524
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:44,280
A toast to your return.

525
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,040
Mr. Wei,

526
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,640
what are your plans
when you are back in China?

527
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,520
We haven't thought about it yet.

528
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,200
I'd be surprised
if she could figure it out.

529
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:04,920
Mr. Wei,

530
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,320
did you really come back
to China with her

531
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,880
in the heat of the moment?

532
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,280
Yes.

533
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,600
I'm in the heat of the moment,

534
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,000
right?

535
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,720
What a pity!

536
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,120
Such a waste of an investment genius.

537
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,800
You won't be on the Forbes list either.

538
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,120
Anyway, you weren't on it.

539
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,360
Well, not really.

540
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,360
It's just that the more time
I spend abroad,

541
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,200
the more I want to go back home

542
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:34,920
and experience the new environment.

543
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,320
Besides, Siqi's so young.

544
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,640
I can't let her stay with me abroad

545
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,160
and live a retirement life.

546
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,040
Besides,

547
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,280
my friend told me

548
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:44,240
that the business environment
in China is not bad

549
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,000
so I want to come back and have a look.

550
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,600
Right, Weilai,

551
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,360
you should know more
about entrepreneurship

552
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,560
in China than I do.

553
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,400
Let's talk about it sometime.

554
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,440
Sure.

555
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,360
Right, Yuan.

556
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,200
How are you?

557
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,520
Have you been promoted?

558
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:01,640
I've been abroad for a year,

559
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,640
and the company's structure has changed.

560
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,400
I just resigned today.

561
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:12,600
I'm now unemployed.

562
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,880
It's all right.

563
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,840
Yuan, a person like you

564
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,520
will shine wherever you go.

565
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,240
Yeah.

566
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,280
Come on.

567
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:26,640
To her unemployment.

568
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,120
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

569
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,000
What are you thinking about?

570
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,520
I'm thinking

571
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,360
that my friends are all gone.

572
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,320
Now, you're leaving, too.

573
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,040
What should I do?

574
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,360
Don't pull a long face.

575
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,160
I'm sure we'll meet again.

576
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,000
I'm lost

577
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,320
and confused.

578
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,360
What am I going to do?

579
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,720
Have you talked to Sophia?

580
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,000
I have.

581
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,200
She's been as supportive

582
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,360
and tolerant as ever.

583
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:28,760
Stop.

584
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,000
Stop it.

585
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,400
Don't show your love in front of me.

586
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,640
Okay?

587
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,920
She's just so supportive

588
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,160
and tolerant,

589
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,880
I don't know what to do.

590
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,560
I can't keep working here,

591
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,520
and I can't bring her back to China.

592
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,320
That's so selfish.

593
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,800
You and Sophia did go through
a lot of ups and downs

594
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,280
before you finally got together

595
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,280
so you should really treasure that.

596
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,240
But you can't let that hold you back.

597
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,840
Think about it.

598
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,040
You two share the same goal.

599
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,120
You both want the best
for each other in the future.

600
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,040
So,

601
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,360
just work towards

602
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,440
your common goal.

603
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,280
Can you make it clearer?

604
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,680
You have to weigh the pros and cons.

605
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,520
Would it be better to stay here

606
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,040
than go back to China?

607
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,600
If you go back to China,

608
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,160
can you find a way

609
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,880
to come back here once every few months?

610
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:31,480
We have to find a way.

611
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,600
It's no use dwelling on it.

612
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,800
I'm even more confused
after hearing what you said.

613
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,280
I'll always support you

614
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,920
in whatever choice you make.

615
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,400
It's my turn.

616
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,560
I didn't expect
the two of them to be alike

617
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,440
after being together
for quite some time.

618
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:12,240
Ye Siqi has matured a bit,

619
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,320
but Mr. Wei

620
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:14,440
has become childish.

621
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,520
The average score has been lowered.

622
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:19,320
Sometimes, I admire Siqi

623
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,760
for doing what she wants to do,

624
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,520
unlike me

625
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,800
who thinks too much

626
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,960
and is too timid to do anything,

627
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,480
and ends up delaying everything.

628
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,800
Are you still thinking
about your resignation?

629
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,480
It's a waste of time

630
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,200
to be in that company.

631
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,920
Actually, it's my relationship with Anna

632
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,720
that makes me feel the worst.

633
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,080
I was her best friend.

634
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,600
But I don't think it matters.

635
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,440
Anyway, once you've
seen someone thoroughly,

636
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,800
it's all over.

637
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,720
Listen,

638
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,960
I want to build my own custom platform

639
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,480
to share some tips

640
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,040
and some of my ideas about traveling.

641
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:00,160
What do you think?

642
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:00,840
It's good.

643
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,360
I'll be your first fan.

644
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:03,120
What a good taste you have.

645
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:03,840
Let's buy everything we need.

646
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,520
My dad's waiting.

647
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,600
What does your dad like to eat?

648
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,000
Seafood or steak?

649
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:13,480
I have no idea.

650
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,920
What doesn't he like to eat?

651
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:21,440
I have no idea.

652
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,600
During the time I spent with my dad,

653
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:26,120
he just ate whatever I wanted.

654
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,800
He ate whatever I ate

655
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,880
so I don't know much about him.

656
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,840
It's okay.

657
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,280
Starting today,

658
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,040
you can get to know him
better and better.

659
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,400
Meat?

660
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,440
Here's a question for you.

661
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,120
What's my favourite food?

662
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,680
You?

663
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,520
Kung Pao Chicken.

664
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,240
No. Think about it again.

665
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,360
What's wrong with that?

666
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,480
You've had Kung Pao Chicken a few times

667
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:54,280
with that guy,

668
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,760
haven't you?

669
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,480
What do you mean?

670
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:59,000
Why are you bringing Hui up again?

671
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,120
Just because I like making
Kung Pao Chicken

672
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:03,400
doesn't mean I like eating it.

673
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,240
Don't be so petty.

674
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,760
Eat a big prawn, come on.

675
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:06,480
Come on.

676
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,000
You need to improve. Get to know me.

677
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,480
Get to know me little by little,
you know?

678
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:11,040
[Seafood Feast.]
Okay, I will.

679
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,040
Sir, you have been looking at
the computer

680
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:33,560
for over an hour.

681
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,840
Don't look at it anymore.

682
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,200
Okay, no more.

683
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,720
What are you reading?

684
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,400
I am reading

685
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,200
about entrepreneurship in China
over the past few years.

686
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,200
Siqi,

687
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:46,480
I think we made a pretty good choice

688
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,000
to return here.

689
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,440
Of course.

690
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,000
Our homeland is the best.

691
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,920
Look,

692
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,240
the opportunities in China these years

693
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:56,240
have multiplied compared to
when I started my business.

694
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:59,920
I think I should seize this opportunity.

695
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,080
You've got an idea?

696
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:05,720
I'm keeping it under wraps for now.

697
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,680
How's it? It's not bad, is it?

698
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,200
Not bad.

699
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,440
You sure you don't want me to help?

700
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,560
No.

701
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,200
You just serve the dishes for me.

702
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,720
I'll get going now.

703
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,480
I'm really leaving.

704
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:51,800
Just one more dish to go.

705
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,800
Okay.

706
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:03,360
How long will it take?

707
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,880
It's almost done.

708
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,080
Dad, you're here.

709
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,360
Mr. Hao, I'm Xia Yuan.

710
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,400
Why don't you two
have a little chat first?

711
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,480
I'm almost done.

712
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,080
Okay, sit down.

713
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:39,720
You taught him to cook?

714
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,600
No.

715
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,000
He's doing it all by himself.

716
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,240
This brat.

717
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:47,800
Coming. Serving up.

718
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,040
I didn't expect this.

719
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,520
Come on.

720
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,480
Yuan.

721
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,920
Thank you, Mr. Hao.

722
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:55,440
Yuan,

723
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,360
thank you very much.

724
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,520
You've been through a lot

725
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,480
with Weilai in the past year.

726
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,000
I know all about it.

727
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,200
But I also know

728
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,200
he wouldn't dare bully you.

729
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,800
What did you say?

730
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,880
Weilai's changed so much

731
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,120
since he got back.

732
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,960
Look.

733
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,480
He learned to cook,

734
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,640
and more importantly,

735
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:19,040
to be tolerant and understanding.

736
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,520
I'm really glad.

737
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,080
Moreover,

738
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,400
he's like a different person

739
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:27,440
when he's with you.

740
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,040
Stop.

741
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,240
I'm embarrassed to
hear you praise me so much.

742
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:32,520
Son,

743
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,560
let me say more today

744
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,600
in front of Yuan, okay?

745
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,440
I used to expect a lot from you,

746
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,920
but my greatest wish

747
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,000
is for you

748
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:45,880
to be happy forever.

749
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,240
So is Yuan.

750
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,400
I hope you'll always be happy.

751
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,000
Thank you, Mr. Hao.

752
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,240
Don't speak while eating or sleeping.

753
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,000
Don't let the dishes get cold.
It's a waste.

754
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,000
Come on.

755
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,880
Let me fill your glasses a little.

756
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,880
Come on.

757
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,800
- Thank you, Mr. Hao.
- I wish you happiness.

758
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,280
He's talking a lot today. Ignore him.

759
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,680
Dig in.

760
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,600
Try my cooking.

761
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:10,880
If you don't eat it, it'll get cold
and it won't taste good.

762
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:11,960
Dig in.

763
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:12,920
Let's dig in.

764
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,160
Come on.

765
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,240
It tastes pretty good.

766
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,360
Yuan, you know what?

767
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:23,480
This is the first time
I've tasted my son's cooking.

768
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,440
Are you done?

769
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,800
Yes, I am.

770
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,920
Let's eat when you're done.

771
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,720
Not bad.

772
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,560
Here it is.

773
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,960
How's it?

774
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:52,920
Sir,

775
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,880
why have you brought me here?

776
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,040
There's no one here.

777
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,120
Yes.

778
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,640
It's really quiet now.

779
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,200
But in the near future,

780
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,720
this place will be a paradise
for entrepreneurs.

781
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,800
In fact, when I was in Europe,

782
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,680
I had an idea to make
an entrepreneurial base

783
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,600
because I saw that young people nowadays

784
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:13,560
are working hard for their own dreams.

785
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,840
It reminded me of when I was young.

786
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:17,960
I've suffered a lot

787
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,640
and I've been through a lot

788
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,680
so I'm going to help them.

789
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,720
This will be a platform
to showcase their talents.

790
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:26,680
I'll turn this place into an
entrepreneurial base and rent it

791
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,960
[T+SPACE]
to young entrepreneurs at a low price.

792
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,800
At the same time,
I'll set up a start-up fund

793
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,800
to select promising projects

794
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,760
from among them

795
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,320
and give them incubation funds.

796
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,080
I'm in.

797
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,800
By then,

798
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,760
I'll open a big nail salon here.

799
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,160
I'll be the chief manicurist,

800
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,960
and you'll be my model.

801
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:51,040
Let's open a plush toy shop,

802
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,840
or a claw machine arcade,

803
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:55,640
but the claws have to be tightened

804
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:58,640
to make sure every customer
can have fun.

805
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:02,120
What should we open here?

806
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:03,480
Anything.

807
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,480
You're the lady boss,

808
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,000
you decide.

809
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:18,920
Thank you, Mister.

810
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,040
You're welcome.

811
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,680
Mr. Ge,

812
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,600
we haven't been paid for months.

813
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:35,560
We need to support our family.

814
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,840
How can we get by?

815
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,600
Do you think I'm right?

816
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,800
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

817
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,880
Guys,

818
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,720
my mates,

819
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,800
I feel as anxious

820
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,760
as you do.

821
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,040
We're trying to figure out what to do.

822
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,360
We'll pay you

823
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,400
all your wages

824
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,680
when we get the money, okay?

825
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:51,560
It's been a long time.

826
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:52,440
We don't have any more money.

827
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,360
- How can we live?
- Yeah.

828
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,240
What should we do?

829
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,520
- How long do we have to wait?
- I have heard

830
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:57,360
that the factory is going
to close down soon.

831
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,920
Why don't you ask Mr. Hao to come down

832
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,680
and tell us

833
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,880
how he's going to handle this?

834
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,160
- Yes.
- Yes.

835
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,400
Mr. Hao is busy handling
these things outside.

836
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,120
We'll pay you as soon as

837
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,360
he gets the money.

838
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,640
The factory is in trouble.

839
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:21,720
You're back.

840
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,560
Stop what you're doing

841
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,280
and I'll tell you something.

842
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:47,520
Do you remember

843
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,680
that young man we met at the airport?

844
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,400
You mean Weilai?

845
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,280
I'm always thinking of

846
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,840
inviting him to our house.

847
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,560
There is something up
with his family right now.

848
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,440
He works in his dad's factory

849
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,640
but it's not doing well

850
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,680
and they's in a lot of debt.

851
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:11,120
It seems difficult to sustain.

852
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,480
Is it that bad?

853
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,400
How miserable

854
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,600
would it be if Yuan

855
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,880
lived with him?

856
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,360
That's what I'm worried about.

857
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:26,880
With Yuan's stubbornness,

858
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,640
when she decides to do something,

859
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,200
she'll stick to her guns until the end.

860
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,640
Song Hangyu's case

861
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,400
has just passed, she's

862
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,360
hardly gotten over it,

863
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,360
and now, she's in the middle of this.

864
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:48,360
Why don't you wait for Yuan to come back

865
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,000
and talk to her

866
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,080
to know what she thinks?

867
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,400
Hi, your coffee's ready.

868
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,000
Monkey.

869
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:12,920
I'm here.

870
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,320
I've seen your designs.

871
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,480
They're amazing.

872
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,800
So, I have something
I want to discuss with you.

873
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,720
Go ahead, Boss.

874
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,000
I want you to be our art director.

875
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,200
Boss,

876
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,040
I have always considered myself

877
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,040
the best designer in the world

878
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,640
because

879
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:41,600
I have got recognised by Hao Weilai.

880
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,440
I'm willing to fulfill
your dreams with you.

881
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,440
Yuan, are you free now?

882
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,640
I want to talk to you about something.

883
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,720
Yes, I'm free.

884
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:13,600
What's it?

885
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,920
Actually,

886
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,520
it's nothing.

887
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:20,280
You've been back for quite some time.

888
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,320
I just want

889
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,520
you to make more friends.

890
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,680
I met with Madam Li

891
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,160
at the last gathering.

892
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:29,760
Do you remember Madam Li?

893
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,040
Her nephew

894
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,800
is doing very well in a German company.

895
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,640
He's now an executive.

896
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:38,240
And my friend's son,

897
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,480
he looked so chubby

898
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,200
when he was a kid.

899
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,240
You met him before.

900
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,120
He's chubby and short.

901
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,880
- At the last gathering,
- Mom.

902
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:48,000
my friend showed me his photo,

903
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,320
- he's changed a lot.
- Mom.

904
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,920
He's so handsome now.

905
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,600
Mom,

906
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,560
I already have a boyfriend.

907
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,400
Why are you telling me this?

908
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:03,040
You mean Weilai?

909
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,480
I would like to ask you

910
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,760
how much do you

911
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,400
know about him?

912
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,560
Do you know about

913
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,360
his family?

914
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,920
Mom,

915
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,920
when I was abroad for a year,

916
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:20,040
we worked and lived together.

917
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,040
I know him well.

918
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,240
We've been through a lot together.

919
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,200
He's really a

920
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,760
very kind and responsible person.

921
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,800
And I've already met his family.

922
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:32,480
He has a sister.

923
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,320
You met Hao Weilai at the airport,

924
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,120
didn't you?

925
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,200
Yes, I did.

926
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,400
Actually, I

927
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,840
don't mean anything by it.

928
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:43,520
You're a big girl now.

929
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:44,840
You have your own ideas.

930
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:47,120
You're mature.

931
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,080
I just want to remind you

932
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,400
not to be too impulsive

933
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,720
in everything you do,

934
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:57,800
and to be careful.

935
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,800
Mom, I'm a grown-up now.

936
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,760
I know all these things.

937
00:43:03,360 --> 00:43:04,600
All right.

938
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:06,360
I trust my daughter.

939
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:08,000
I trust your judgment.

940
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:09,880
All right then.

941
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,200
I'm off.

942
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:11,840
Mom,

943
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:13,200
you should go and rest earlier.

944
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:13,840
Okay.

945
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:16,160
Don't talk nonsense with those ladies.

946
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:19,320
Okay.

947
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:21,360
Don't stay up too late. Go to bed early.

948
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,320
Mom, you have an early night, too.

949
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,440
