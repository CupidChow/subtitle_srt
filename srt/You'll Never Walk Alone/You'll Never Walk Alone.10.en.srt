That's why I offer such a low price.

183
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,280
But I didn't think

184

00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,400
Whatever. In the future,

186
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:49,680
I won't do this kind of business again.

From now on,

189
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:58,000
and enjoy my retirement life.

190
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,880
Your hands are red.

191
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,200
It's fine. Let's carry on.

192
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,520
Hello. Here's your french fries.

193
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,560
Thank you.

194
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,360
I hope you enjoy it.

195
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,560
Wei!

196
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,280
Wei!

197
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,320
Come on.

198
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,720
Be careful.

199
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,600
Give us a hand.

200
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,880
- Hurry.
- Easy.

201
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,400
Lay him down.

202
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,840
Easy. Okay.

203
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,880
Please give us some space.

204
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:28,360
We have called the ambulance.

205
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,160
The ambulance is on the way.

206
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:41,630
[One way, Police station]

207
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:47,870
[Police]

208
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,880
There he is. Go on.

209
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,360
Alright. Thank you.

210
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,840
Thank you so much. Please go ahead.

211
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,120
Mischief Man, how did it go?

212
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,600
What are you doing here, Mischief Boy?

213
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,360
I told you to stay at the winery.

214
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,000
You said I could go out

215
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,200
if Quan and Scar accompanied me.

216
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,400
I listened to you.

217
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,320
Good.

218
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,600
Let's go back to eat.

219
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,600
How did it go?

220
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,320
It went well.

221
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:18,720
Hui.

222
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:20,560
I'm here for a food delivery.

223
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,880
Where is the reception?

224
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,040
Okay. Thank you.

225
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,720
Hui.

226
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,240
Young Master.

227
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,800
Look at this kid.

228
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,400
Quan.

229
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,600
Give this card to Hui.

230
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,160
We'll wait for you in the car.

231
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,520
Alright.

232
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,720
Let's go.

233
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,720
Okay.

234
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:10,830
[Ambulance]

235
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:16,760
Give me a hand.

236
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,400
Sure.

237
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:18,600
Ready?

238
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,600
Be careful.

239
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,600
Be careful.

240
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,880
Siqi, I didn't know you knew first aid.

241
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,560
Qiao Bin, you're a lifeguard.

242
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:51,680
You should have gotten there before me.

243
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,160
What if something serious
happened to him?

244
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:53,560
I...

245
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,840
It's not like that, Kiki.

246
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,680
We rushed over immediately.

247
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,280
Young Master.

248
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,600
Make life easier for yourself.

249
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,240
Hire someone.

250
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:23,240
Uncle Quan, I don't want his money.

251
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,200
Just think of it as his investment.

252
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,480
- Take it.
- I don't need it.

253
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,440
Why are you like this?

254
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,160
You are a family.

255
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,520
He's not my family.

256
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,760
Young Master.

257
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,800
Mr. Xu is your father.

258
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,240
Ever since you left,

259
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,320
he's been longing for you
to come home every day.

260
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:44,000
He's old now.
He needs someone beside him.

261
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,040
I have to stay by his side
when he needs it.

262
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,000
Then when I needed him,

263
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,200
where was he?

264
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,840
He just doesn't want you
having a hard time.

265
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,960
It's the love of a parent.

266
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,920
Be understanding.

267
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,640
I can't be understanding with him.

268
00:14:57,640 --> 00:15:00,040
Uncle Quan, just leave me alone
from now on.

269
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,880
Mr. Xu.

270
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,440
Young Master wants to be independent.

271
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,800
That's a good thing.

272
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,880
So that's what happened.

273
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,800
I think it's nice staying here.

274
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,040
It's a nice place with good food.

275
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,320
Mischief Man and the rest
treat us well too.

276
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,120
Most importantly, it's safe.

277
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,040
It's indeed pretty good here.

278
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,120
But we can't live here rent-free.

279
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,000
We must show our worth.

280
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,880
Yes, you're absolutely right.

281
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,880
Talented people like us

282
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,960
must shine wherever we go

283
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,200
and show our worth.

284
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,360
I'm feeling sick.

285
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,080
You said that first.

286
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,200
Why are you feeling sick?

287
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,960
Fine. Let's change the subject.

288
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,200
I met someone today.

289
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,880
Quan and the rest
called him Young Master.

290
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,200
I'm guessing
he's probably Mischief Man's son.

291
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,280
Mr. Xu has a son?

292
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,840
He never mentioned it.

293
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,160
His son doesn't stay with him either.

294
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,760
The two of them are probably

295
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,960
not on good terms.

296
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,920
Mischief Man asked Quan
to give him money.

297
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:37,800
But he refused it.

298
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,720
It does sound odd.

299
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:42,640
But if Mr. Xu isn't telling us,

300
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,320
we shouldn't pry.

301
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,520
But he looked quite pitiful.

302
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,840
We should help him.

303
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:00,800
Hui.

304
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,080
Don't go.

305
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:04,400
I wish we could talk it out again.

306
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,480
What do you want to talk about?

307
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,600
Your business?

308
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,840
Or your money?

309
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,480
There's nothing left between us
to talk about.

310
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,440
Hui, please forgive me.

311
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,280
From now on, I will find a way

312
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,160
to spend more time with you. Okay?

313
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,240
The point isn't to spend time with me.

314
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,280
Do you know what day it is?

315
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,560
Today is my mother's death anniversary.

316
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,680
You weren't around
when my mother passed.

317
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,920
You weren't around
for her first death anniversary.

318
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,480
People say you are devoted.

319
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,280
But I don't feel it at all.

320
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,680
Wait.

321
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,000
Wait.

322
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,320
Just let me say one more thing.

323
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,360
I feel terrible too

324
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:40,120
that your mother has passed.

325
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,520
I love both of you.

326
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,240
Trust me. Perhaps

327
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,120
the way I love you isn't right.

328
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:45,880
But from now on,

329
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,960
I will try my best to make up for it.

330
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,600
Okay?

331
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:50,080
You can save it!

332
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,080
Let's never meet again.

333
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,120
No, Hui.

334
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,960
Hui!

♪Bright and beautiful♪

336
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,200
Good evening, Mischief Man.

337
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,920
Good evening, Mischief Boy.

338
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,200
I didn't think you would know this song.

339
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,000
Of course I do.
You've never heard me sing,

340
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,200
but I'm a karaoke dominator.

341
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,400
Here. Try the grapes I picked today.

342
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,600
Sure.

343
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,800
If you want grapes next time,

344
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,560
just tell Quan.

345
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,160
You don't have to pick them yourself.

346
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,400
The orchard is very filthy.

347
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,000
There are lots of bugs too.

348
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,160
The grapes are tastier
if you pick them yourself.

349
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,280
You're right, though.

350
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,880
The grapes today do taste great.

351
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,520
So,

352
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,480
how are you settling in at the winery?

353
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,160
Find out if Xia still needs anything.

354
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,440
If you need anything,

355
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,360
just let me know.

356
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,600
I got it, Mischief Man.

357
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,120
You've said this a thousand times.

358
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,200
Xia Yuan and I are settling well here,

359
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,880
as if we're living a magical life.

360
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,960
Good. I'm glad to hear that.

361
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,280
However,

362
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,960
I have one small request.

363
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,240
Go ahead.

364
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,560
You saved me and Xia Yuan.

365
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,160
We should be thanking you.

366
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,480
But we're living here rent-free.

367
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,720
You are raising us like pigs.

368
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,920
So we're not able

369
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,520
to show our worth.

370
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,120
That is why

371
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,160
I wish to get a job at your winery.

372
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,920
I get what you mean.

373
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,960
Still, I don't want you all

374
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,880
to do those manual labor.

375
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,960
I'm not saying this out of courtesy.

376
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,240
I'll be straight with you.

377
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,800
I was forcibly

378
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,440
sent abroad by my father to work.

379
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,520
I was really against it at first.

380
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,720
But as I kept working, I got used to it.

381
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,880
Now that I'm not working,

382
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,160
I feel uneasy.

383
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,600
That's why I went around
your winery today

384
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,040
and asked around.

385
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,040
They said you're indeed shorthanded.

386
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,960
So please let me and Xia Yuan work here.

387
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,120
Your father was absolutely right

388
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,160
to send you abroad.

389
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,640
Look at you now.

390
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,560
You don't act like a spoiled child.

391
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,440
It made you so well-grounded.

392
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,160
That's great.

393
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,280
Right, my foot.

394
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,640
What kind of father
cruelly sends their child abroad

395
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,920
without caring about them?

396
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:33,680
Fine.

397
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,960
Perhaps I wasn't good enough back then.

398
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,520
I was an eyesore to him.

399
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,560
But it's not like I had a choice.

400
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,920
I can't choose the environment
I was born into.

401
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,160
I can't choose my family.

402
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,960
He even used to say that
he wants to provide us

403
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,560
with a comfortable life.

404
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,560
And then, he regrets it.

405
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,320
Now,

406
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,680
he says I grew up in
a problematic environment.

407
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,480
He wants me to change.

408
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,800
How am I supposed to change?

409
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:58,440
A parent's love is selfless.

410
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,240
I am a father myself.

411
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,480
There are things

412
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,720
that a father can't say
to their children.

413
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,840
Got it?

414
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,600
Save your advice for me.

415
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,640
Your relationship with your child

416
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,240
seems to be strained as well.

417
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,120
Every family has its problems.

418
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:20,320
But my son and you

419
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,640
are quite similar.

420
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:23,320
You both have strong personalities.

421
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,240
I can never figure out

422
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,080
what he's thinking.

423
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,560
I'm always worried
he's having a hard time on his own.

424
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,440
That's why I would
regularly send someone

425
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,200
to check on his situation.

426
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,800
One time, I seriously

427
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,840
couldn't help it.

428
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,240
So I went to see him.

429
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,920
In the end, we got into a big fight.

430
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,000
You brought it upon yourself.

431
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,880
He moved out

432
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,040
to prevent you from seeing him

433
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,520
and finding him.

434
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,760
Why must you find him?

435
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,680
You were just asking for a fight.

436
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,680
You're right.

437
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,160
Mischief Boy.

438
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,360
Do you think I am a good father?

439
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,240
Of course you are.

440
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,360
If you were my father,

441
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,800
I'd be over the moon.

442
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,400
But my son

443
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,040
doesn't think so.

444
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,160
Mischief Man.

445
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,280
I don't know

446
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,560
what happened between you and your son.

447
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,360
But in my heart,

448
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,160
you are a good father.

449
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,160
You must believe that.

450
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,920
Thank you.

451
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:39,000
Thank you.

452
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:40,040
Have some grapes.

453
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:40,720
Sure.

454
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,120
Eat grapes without spitting out
the grape skin.

455
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,840
It tastes so sweet.

456
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:52,320
The fruits of your own labor
hits different.

457
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:53,960
You're right.

458
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,400
I'll have another.

459
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,040
Sure.

460
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,440
What's the matter?

461
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:29,000
I think you were right.

462
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,120
Putting Ye Siqi and Qiao Bin together

463
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,440
is like dynamite.

464
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,800
Sadly, Qiao Bin doesn't know.

465
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,520
He has no idea what the reason is.

466
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,640
Since you know,

467
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,440
you should tell him.

468
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:49,000
How would I dare to tell him?

469
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,560
He came here

470
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,920
for the sake of Ye Siqi.

471
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:53,040
His entire life

472
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,560
revolves around Ye Siqi.

473
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,840
What if I told him

474
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,240
and he couldn't accept it?

475
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:02,760
Yuan.

476
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,320
You're here.

477
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:05,720
Sit.

478
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,280
Yuan, I miss you so much.

479
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,640
Let me have a look.

480
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,320
Not bad. You didn't lose weight.

481
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,240
What about me?

482
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,000
Why are you here again?

483
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,200
Hao Weilai, you never change.

484
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,160
You called me over,
saying that Yuan missed me.

485
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,400
But why didn't you tell me

486
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,200
there was a tail tagging along?

487
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,760
Are you upset?

488
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:35,760
If you are, then just leave.

489
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,760
Ask your sister if she misses you.

490
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,760
If your sister can miss you,

491
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,120
why can't I miss my buddy?

492
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,000
Here. Eat something.

493
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,280
To keep your mouth shut.

494
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,760
I don't want any of your food.

495
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,040
Don't try to bribe me.

496
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,080
Suit yourself, then.

497
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,360
What do you want for dinner?

498
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,080
- I'll ask the kitchen to prepare it.
- Eat mine.

499
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,680
Let me try.

500
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,480
Chicken breast meat.

501
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,400
I want Fried Pork in Scoop.

502
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,680
Scoop, my foot! We don't have that.

503
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,160
In that case, I want red swamp crayfish.

504
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,400
You want to have crayfish abroad?

505
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,640
In your dreams.

506
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,720
Then I'm sure they've got mitten crabs.

507
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,960
Mitten crabs are seasonal, Miss.

508
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,840
We don't have it.

509
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,320
You have nothing I want.

510
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,080
Yuan, let's not hang out with them.

511
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,160
Let's go out for a walk.

512
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,600
That's great. I'll show you around.

513
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,520
Bring me along too.

514
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:14,960
You can't come along. You're annoying.

515
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,720
He wants to come along too.
Bring him along.

516
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,760
- Bring him along.
- I'm not going.

517
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,120
- I'm not going.
- Go.

518
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,560
Kids, the kitchen

519
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,440
made a couple of new dishes today.

520
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,320
Try it.

521
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,080
See if it's nice.

522
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,040
I'm not done recording.

523
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,960
This will do.

524
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,400
Kids, what are you doing?

525
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,960
I'm recording a vlog

526
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,160
to capture moments in life.

527
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,760
Look. These are

528
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,200
the videos I recorded today.

529
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,200
I will pick some

530
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,400
good clips later,

531
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,520
then make them into

532
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,160
a short video using an editing software.

533
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,080
That's good.

534
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,400
Do young people nowadays

535
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,440
like doing these?

536
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,280
It is very complicated?

537
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,720
It's not hard to get started.

538
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:06,040
But I'm still far from being an expert.

539
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:07,840
People of all ages

540
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,200
can try vlogging.

541
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,960
Many people your age

542
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,080
are vlogging, too.

543
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:12,680
Really?

544
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,160
I'm quite interested in it.

545
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,920
But I don't even
use my phone that often.

546
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,480
Don't worry. I'll teach you.

547
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,440
Great.

548
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,360
Look.

549
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,680
How do I do it?

550
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:29,680
Like this.

551
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,760
Can't you have some patience?

552
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,160
I'm asking for your help,

553
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,480
but you're so annoyed.

554
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:37,720
Come on.

555
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:38,880
Take a look.

556
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,480
How do I do it?

557
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,240
Like this. Got it?

558
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:41,840
I know.

559
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,360
But why isn't it working
when I tap on this?

560
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,200
How would I know?

561
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,160
(Something's wrong with your phone.)

562
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,800
Then cut the video like this

563
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,520
and zoom in on this.

564
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,840
Then combine this video and this video

565
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:55,920
using this

566
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,280
- editing software.
- Hao Weilai.

567
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,240
- Look. The video clip is done.
- Hao Weilai.

568
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:00,400
What are you thinking about?

569
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,000
Nothing. Eat up.

570
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,760
This thing is amazing.

571
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,520
Great. Thank you.

572
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,320
I've learned something from you today.

573
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:10,920
Dig in.

574
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,600
Okay.

575
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,840
How's it going, Sis?

576
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,560
This is where I'm staying.

577
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,880
Did you get a good look?

578
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,280
The place looks exquisite.

579
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,360
Hao Weilai.

580
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,880
What are you up to over there?

581
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,240
Me? I'm...

582
00:28:25,720 --> 00:28:27,720
working as a fruit farmer at an orchard.

583
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,600
But I met a kind person,

584
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,160
so I got to enjoy some benefits.

585
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,360
He treated me with great hospitality.

586
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,640
A fruit farmer?

587
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,720
Fine, then.

588
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:37,240
Keep it up, fruit farmer!

589
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:38,760
I will.

590
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,560
Why are you hemming and hawing?

591
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:49,160
Well...

592
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,120
How's the old man doing?

593
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,480
Add him on WeChat

594
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,640
and ask him yourself.

595
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,760
No.

596
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,880
I'm not giving in first.

597
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,640
You're the best, Sis.

598
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,040
Please just tell me.

599
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:03,400
Hao Weilai.

600
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:04,880
Giving in doesn't mean losing.

601
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:05,800
As the younger generation,

602
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,160
you should take the initiative.

603
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,440
Your father is alone in China.

604
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,760
Do you know how lonely he is?

605
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:12,120
You should show him some concern.

606
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:12,640
Do you know that?

607
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,000
Alright, Sis.

608
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,640
Stop lecturing me.

609
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,600
Speaking of which,

610
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,000
I might be going on a work trip
to Europe later on.

611
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,640
I'll lecture you when I get there.

612
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,480
No, Sis. Please don't.

613
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,480
Don't come here.

614
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,040
Just stay in China.

615
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:25,840
That's it.

616
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,920
I've got to go. Bye!

617
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,680
There's nothing to do
in the factory now.

618
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,840
So I let them go on vacation.

619
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,280
Another thing...

620
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:59,480
There are workers saying
they want to quit again.

621
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,400
Make sure they get

622
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,720
every penny of their salary.

623
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,080
Yes, sir.

624
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,480
Siqi, I have something to tell you.

625
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,640
Qiao Bin.

626
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,000
We have nothing left to talk about.

627
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:23,680
What's the matter with you?

628
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,640
You were still alright at dinner.

629
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,040
Why are you always so childish?

630
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:28,840
Earlier at dinner,

631
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,560
I didn't want to ruin the mood.

632
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,280
It doesn't mean we have made up.

633
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:34,720
Fine. I know I was wrong.

634
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,760
Forgive me.

635
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,000
It's not a matter of whether
you know you were wrong.

636
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,360
Have you ever thought that

637
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,640
it's not your fault?

638
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,480
It's just that I cannot accept it.

639
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,240
It's just like,

640
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,440
I love drinking cola,

641
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:46,960
while you like eating
chicken breast meat.

642
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,680
Neither of us is wrong.

643
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,880
We're just too different.

644
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,840
Have you heard of this song?

645
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:58,320
♪I'm standing on your left♪

646
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:01,920
♪But it's like we're separated
by the Milky Way♪

647
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,680
There is

648
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,560
the Milky Way between us.

649
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,320
The Milky Way?

650
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,480
Wait, Siqi.

651
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:13,920
If we're separated by The Milky Way,

652
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,440
doesn't that make us
The Cowherd and the Weaver Girl?

653
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,600
I...

654
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,680
That should be right.

655
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,480
Qiao Bin.

656
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,600
There's a party this evening.

657
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,720
Why don't you come?

658
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,240
I'll pass.

659
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,760
It's my birthday party.

660
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:50,800
I'd be happy if you could come.

661
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,840
Alright, then.

662
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,920
Give me the address later.

663
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,000
Make sure you be there.

664
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:05,320
Really?

665
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,320
Yes.

666
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,440
I hope you like it.

667
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,440
Thank you.

668
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:28,800
Hello, Sophia.

669
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,120
Hi, Lisa.

670
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:34,760
The party...

671
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,600
Wait a moment.

672
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,480
Happy Birthday.

673
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,360
Thank you for coming.

674
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,200
Come and have fun.

675
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:02,240
You can do it!

676
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:21,200
You can do it!

677
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,800
- Go! Go!
- You can do it!

678
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,360
Here.

679
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,240
Your double espresso.

680
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,920
Thank you.

681
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,000
What are you drawing?

682
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:02,320
I'm designing a wine label.

683
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,120
I find that the labels
on the wine bottles

684
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,600
look too plain.

685
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,880
I think it affects the sales.

686
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,360
That's why I want to improve it

687
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,200
and see if the sales will get better.

688
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,000
You are using your talents

689
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,680
to its full potential.

690
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,200
Look at me.

691
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,960
I've come to enjoy double espresso now.

692
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,400
You have a powerful charm.

693
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:49,080
Congratulations.

694
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,040
You're drinking coffee now.

695
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,200
It means you've grown up.

696
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,680
What does drinking coffee
have to do with maturing?

697
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:59,440
But I think my time in Europe
has been far more interesting

698
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,400
than the past 20-over years of my life.

699
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,200
Think about it.

700
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,640
We've been through so much.

701
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,760
It was really nerve-racking.

702
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:12,240
I really didn't expect
so much to happen.

703
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,320
I don't know

704
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:20,120
if it was a surprise or a shock.

705
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,280
Have you been sending emails lately?

706
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,880
I haven't sent emails for a long time.

707
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,240
- Bye.
- Bye-bye!

708
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,480
- Bye.
- Bye-bye!

709
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,600
Good night.

710
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:22,960
Ben.

711
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:24,760
Qiao Bin.

712
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,200
Sophia.

713
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:30,000
I had a lot of fun on your birthday.

714
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,800
Happy Birthday.

715
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,440
Happy Birthday.

716
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,520
Good morning.

717
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,480
You drank a lot last night.

718
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,120
Quickly have some milk.

719
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,440
I...

720
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:26,680
We didn't do anything.

721
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,600
Really. Nothing happened.

722
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:30,920
Don't worry.

723
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,720
Thank you.

724
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:46,320
[Planjka Beach, Have A Nice Day]

725
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,480
Go home, Sophia.

726
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,640
I should go.

727
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,240
Keep it up.

728
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,240
Quan.

729
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,640
We're just going out for a walk.

730
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:17,960
Is the outfit necessary?

731
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,760
We're a family.

732
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,920
So we must dress sharp and uniformed.

733
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,040
What about Mischief Man?

734
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,760
Mr. Xu isn't interested in
such activities.

735
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,720
He has gone to rest.

736
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:31,080
Mr. Xu will be bored being home alone.

737
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,240
Don't worry. I've asked Biao to stay.

738
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,840
Alright. Attention, everyone.

739
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,120
For this operation,

740
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,800
we must first of all ensure
Weilai and Xia Yuan's safety.

741
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,360
Second of all,
we must take note of our image.

742
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,360
On my command!

743
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:43,680
Attention!

744
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,160
Left, face!

745
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,720
Forward march!

Quan.

748
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,200
Mr. Xu.

749

760
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,880
that it's just the two of us for lunch.
