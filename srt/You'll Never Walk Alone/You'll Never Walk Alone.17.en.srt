it's been a pleasure to meet you.

42
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,760
Thank you.

43
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:06,200
Xia, it's nice to meet you, too.

44
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,160
To be honest, I like you.

45
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,880
I don't like you because

46
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:12,800
you like listening to my songs.

47
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,480
I like you because

48
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,040
you've been by

You two are not a couple yet.

54
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,320
But I also know

55
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,360
that you've been through a lot together

56
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,360
in the last few months.

57
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,440
It's a rare bond

58
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,960
that should be cherished.

59
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,040
Xia,

60
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:43,160
actually, there's something

61
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,360
I've never told Weilai

62
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,560
but I want to tell you today.

63
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,000
My uncle

64
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,040
is bankrupt.

65
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,000
How can he be bankrupt?

66
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,680
My uncle ran a furniture factory

67
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,600
and it's doing well.

68
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,280
But some time ago, he found out
that one of his managers

69
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,600
was using the designs of external orders

70
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,800
to make copies of the same models

71
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,680
and sell them.

72
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,800
The factory was soon reported.

73
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,760
My uncle didn't see this coming.

74
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,520
He chose to send Weilai away

75
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,040
because he didn't want him to know.

76
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,720
Xia,

77
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,640
promise me

78
00:04:31,640 --> 00:04:34,320
you won't tell Weilai about this.

79
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,480
I came to work here

80
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,200
to see how he's doing.

81
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,040
I'm relieved now.

82
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,360
I think he's having a good time here

83
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,960
and he's matured a lot.

84
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,800
How is Mr. Hao doing now?

85
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,200
My uncle

86
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,720
has sold his house.

87
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,160
And he's laid off workers
at the factory.

88
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,320
I don't think there'll be

89
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,640

90
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,120
But don't worry.

91
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,000
I've found him a new house.

92
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,200
I'll visit him more often.

93
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,200
My uncle is a proud man.

94
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,040
Even when our families are close,

95
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,600
he often refuses my help.

96
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,960
Xia,

97
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,240
promise me

98
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:44,200
that you'll be there for him

99
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,520
no matter what difficulties or setbacks

100
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,280
he encounters in the future.

101
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,360
What's the old man up to?

102
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,000
He's not replying to my messages.

103
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,440
Xia Yuan, you're back.

104
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,880
What did my sister tell you?

105
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,120
You've been waiting for me?

106
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,280
Of course.

107
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,360
Why did you take so long
to see my sister off?

108
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,280
Let me ask you.

109
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,800
Did my sister badmouth me to you?

110
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,280
Take a guess.

111
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,560
Take a guess?

112
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,920
Why should I?

113
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,040
Wait.

114
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,320
Did my sister tell you

115
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,960
that I used to have many girlfriends?

116
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,920
She lied to you.

117
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,960
I'm just popular among women.

118
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,400
They all think I'm their friend.

119
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,800
They're really just friends.

120
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,680
Don't listen to her.

121
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,080
What else?

122
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,480
What else?

123
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,880
I lost my first kiss when I was five.

124
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,880
She kissed me.

125
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,560
I was reluctant.

126
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,200
What else?

127
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,040
What else?

128
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,480
No more.

129
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,240
No more?

130
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,680
Your sister didn't say anything.

131
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,240
You confessed.

132
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,160
What did I confess?

133
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,360
You had a lot of girlfriends.

134
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,320
You're very popular among women.

135
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,120
Isn't that what she said?

136
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,680
We can design a gift box
for Valentine's Day.

137
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,720
Hui is still communicating
with the factory

138
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,040
about the design and packaging.

139
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,480
Seeing that Hui is getting
more and more capable,

140
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,400
Mischief Man can rest assured.

141
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,920
With Hui and Sakura by his side,

142
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,640

What's wrong with you?

152
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,280
Nothing.

153
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,760
Hao Weilai,

154
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,600
can you promise me one thing?

155
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,040
What's it?

156
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:18,280
No matter how big a trouble you're in,

157
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:20,120
how sad you are,

158
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,480
you must tell me first.

159
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,800
Why are you acting weird?

160
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,880
There's nothing to be sad about.

161
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,840
I've come all the way through.

162
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,640
Promise me first.

163
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,600
Okay, I promise you.

164
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,840
I got the award I promised you.

165
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,240
The first place.

166
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,320
Sophia, look.

167
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,720
I got the award

168
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,480
I promised you. The first place.

169
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,560
Mr. Xu's illness

170
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,840
seems to be getting worse

these days.

172
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,560
Luckily, he's willing to
cooperate with the treatment.

173
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,400
Hui is taking care of him.

174
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,880
I hope this will ease his illness.

175
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,760
I hope so.

176
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,520
You said

177
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:06,040
you wanted to prove yourself
to your dad.

178
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,120
Now that your team has won the award,

179
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,160
it should be a kind of proof.

180
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,960
It could be an encouragement to my team

181
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,320
and I could get more orders.

182
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:19,640
I've told my dad

183
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,200
about the award.

184
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,360
How's it?

185
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,640
What did your dad say?

186
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,560
He hasn't replied yet.

187
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,440
Maybe

188
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,280
he still thinks I'm being unreasonable.

189
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,320
He won't.

190
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,600
Listen here.

191
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,080
Your dad

192
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,720
must be very proud of you.

193
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,720
He loves you very much.

194
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,560
I hope so.

195
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,480
Why are you telling me this
all of a sudden?

196
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,480
Did my sister tell you

197
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,280
to tell me to talk more to my dad?

198
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,680
Did she?

199
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,240
He hasn't even replied to my messages.

200
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,640
How can I talk to him?

201
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,080
One-sided communication, huh?

202
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,800
He's a man who just
likes to portray himself

203
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,480
as incredibly strong.

204
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,880
Don't listen to my sister.

205
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:18,640
No.

206
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,520
She didn't tell me anything about this.

207
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,280
All right.

208
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:27,240
You're doing this for my sake.

209
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,560
Xia Yuan,

210
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:33,880
do you think

211
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,560
we should

212
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,640
leave the winery?

213
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,440
Why?

214
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:44,200
Now the operation of
the winery is on the right track,

215
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,440
and Hui has returned to Mischief Man.

216
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,480
I think it's a bit redundant

217
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,840
to have us here.

218
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,480
So, where are we going?

219
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,760
I haven't thought about it.

220
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,200
Let's just take it one step at a time.

221
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,160
Why is Sakura playing there by himself?

222
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,280
Sakura.

223
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,440
Sakura.

224
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,360
Come here.

225
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,520
Come on, quick.

226
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,880
Sakura.

227
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,520
Why are you wandering around?

228
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,200
Who were you playing with?

229
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,680
Get up.

230
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,200
Well, I remember

231
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,840
I've got things to do. I'll be off.

232
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:23,680
Xia Yuan,

233
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,480
calm down.

234
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,200
You're both adults.

Right, here you go.

00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,200
Look, this

239
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,080
is the logo I designed with my friend.

240
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:17,960
How's it?

241
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,080
It's for a winery.

242
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,400
Not bad.

243
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,880
This mirror lake

244
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,320
symbolizes beautiful love.

245
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,320
Drink this wine

and you'll have all three feelings.

247
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,160
Dad, it would be a shame if you didn't

248
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,320
go into publicity.

249
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,800
If I were to endorse it,

250
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,840
it would be a success.

00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:45,800
How are you going to celebrate?

255
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:47,440
We're an old married couple.

256
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,400
We don't have to celebrate it.

257
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,360
Yeah.

258
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,760

Listen here.

260
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,080
I've booked you tickets

261
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,160
to Hainan.

262
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,800
You must go and have a good time.

263
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,000
Why go to all the trouble?

264
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,880
Just live your life.

265
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,960
Mum, Dad said you look like a mermaid.

266
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,200
Mermaids must go to the sea.

267
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,480
Yes.

268
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,800
She's an old mermaid now.

269
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,360
What are you talking about? Seriously.

270
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:14,480
Sit down.

271
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:15,920
Well...

272
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,880
Yuan, you...

273
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,080
What's wrong?

274
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,280
You've got to live a good life, too.

00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,360
If you find the right man,

276
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,480
you can try to get along with him.

After all, it's been so long

278
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,120
since that incident.

279
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,320
I know. Don't worry.

280
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,200
I've bid farewell to the past.

00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,200
is that you and Dad
are healthy and happy.

about anything else.

We hope you'll be healthy, happy

285

00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,960
don't mind you seeing a foreigner.

As long as you like him,
we're all for it.

289
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:03,560
Really?

290
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,200
Well,

291
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,560
I'm going to look for a foreigner, then.

292
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,200
Don't be upset

293
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,920
if I bring him back to see you.

294
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,360
Which nationality do you prefer?

295
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,360
This is awesome.

296
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,800
What are you doing?

297
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,320
What are you doing?

298
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,520
I'm watching a meteor shower.

299
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,760
What meteor shower?

300
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:55,240
You promised me a meteor shower.

301
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,120
You're not going back
on your promise, are you?

302
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,160
I am not.

303
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,240
You're not going today, are you?

304
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,120
Yeah, I've got everything ready.

305
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,280
I've never watched
a meteor shower before.

306
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,640
When I see it later,

307
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,480
I'll take a picture
and post it on Weibo.

308
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,520
It's said that if you
re-post the meteor shower,

309
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,960
your wishes will come true.

310
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:16,600
But I can't make it today.

311
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,840
I'm meeting my friend
for a game this afternoon.

312
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:23,040
Boss, just go with me.

313
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:23,960
I've already checked it.

314
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,920
There's a meteor shower tonight.

315
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,200
After tonight,
we'll have to wait 20 years

316
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,360
and I'll be an old woman by then.

317
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,600
Just go with me.

318
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,600
Come on, let's go today.

319
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,160
Let's go.

320
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,560
Where are you taking me to?

321
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:46,560
I'm not telling you.

322
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:56,120
Okay, we've arrived.

323
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,320
What are you doing?

324
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,280
Open your eyes.

325
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:13,640
Yuan,

326
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,800
after meeting you,

327
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,320
my life has drastically changed.

328
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,640
Before this,

329
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,280
my life was nothing but pain and hatred.

330
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,920
But I feel joy and happiness now.

331
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,000
Thank you for saving the irrational me.

332
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,240
Thank you for all you've done
for the winery.

333
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,600
And thank you for taking care of my dad.

334
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,960
All this time,

335
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,440
you've been helping me.

336
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,680
Now, let me be your talisman.

337
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:47,920
Yuan,

338
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,000
will you be my girlfriend?

339
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,680
Hui, I'm sorry.

340
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,920
I can't say yes.

341
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:14,280
Is it because of Hao Weilai?

342
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,920
I'm really sorry.

343
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,120
Hello, Ding.

344
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,280
I have something to tell you.

345
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,720
I can't make it to the game
this afternoon.

346
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,040
Something's come up.

347
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,480
I have something to deal with.
All right.

348
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,480
I'm sorry. Bye.

349
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,320
Boss, have you ever watch
a meteor shower before?

350
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,440
I just don't understand

351
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,200
why so many people would

352
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,280
sacrifice their sleep

353
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:03,200
to watch a fleeting
astronomical phenomenon.

354
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,440
It's just not interesting.

355
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,400
Imagine, on an open field,

356
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:17,120
late at night, under the stars,

357
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,960
far away from the hustle
and bustle of the city,

358
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,280
slowing down the pace of life.

00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,960
That's my bed.

360
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,680
It's so beautiful.

361
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,120
Boss, do you need help?

362
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,720

00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,240
Watch out for snakes there.

376
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,760
Snakes?

377
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:13,680
Yes.

378
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:21,280
Boss, it's really beautiful here.

379
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,120
What are you

380
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,200
shouting about?

381
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,800
There is a snake there.

382
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,120
Where?

383
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,880
It's over there.

384
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,800
That's a branch, not a snake.

385
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,600
It's really a snake.

386
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,680
See for yourself
if you don't believe me.

387
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,000
It's really not a snake.

388
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,880
I don't want to see it.

389
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,320
Look.

390
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Xia Yuan.

391
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,560
Why are you sitting here alone?

392
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,880
I couldn't sleep
so I went out for a walk.

393
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,760
What about you?

394
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,600
I couldn't sleep, too.

395
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,840
The longer I live here,

396
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,440
the more it feels like home.

397
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,920
Mischief Man and the others

398
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,680
are like family to me.

399
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:05,520
Did your dad reply to your messages?

400
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:08,800
No.

401
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,840
But I know

402
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,880
he probably loves me.

403
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,040
I just can't feel it.

404
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,920
My mom's the one

405
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,800
who's looking after me since I was born.

406
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:34,160
My dad just ignored me

407
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,680
and didn't care about me.

408
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:39,160
Ever since my mom passed away,

409
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,800
it's been like a wall between us.

410
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,320
He doesn't understand me,

411
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,240
and so do I.

412
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,000
My deepest memory of him

413
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,640
is when I was ten years old
on my birthday.

414
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,240
He said he'd take me
to the amusement park,

415
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,400
but then he stood me up.

416
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,760
Every birthday after that,

417
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,520
he said he'd take me
to the amusement park,

418
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,240
but he never made it.

419
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,080
So my expectations of him

420
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,760
got lower and lower.

421
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:17,120
Let me tell you something funny.

422
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,480
I've never been to an amusement park.

423
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:24,640
Hence,

424
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,680
you two need to talk to each other
more than anything else.

425
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,320
I think relationships between people

426
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,480
are like Tetris.

427
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,680
If you don't get rid of
the squares on the bottom,

428
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,920
the top will only get higher and higher.

429
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,920
It's like your relationship
with your dad.

430
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,200
If you don't open your hearts,

431
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,680
your conflicts will only get deeper.

432
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:50,040
Why are you talking
like a philosopher now?

433
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:51,960
You're so eloquent.

434
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:57,280
What were you thinking
sitting here all alone?

435
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,800
I couldn't sleep

436
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,240
and I was considering
the advice you gave me.

437
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,880
I've decided

438
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,440
to leave with you.

439
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,840
Really?

440
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,800
It's time

441
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,840
to say goodbye to this winery.

442
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,200
Are you here for dinner?

443
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,680
Do you know what
you're doing here today?

444
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,360
To watch a meteor shower.

445
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:58,200
Shouldn't you sleep early?

446
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,520
Stop eating and sleep now.

447
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:03,520
You're sleeping at this hour?

448
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,760
It's not like you don't know my routine.

449
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:13,000
Boss, since I met you,

450
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,160
my biological clock is all messed up.

451
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,840
I used to go to bed at midnight.

452
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,600
Your biological clock isn't
messed up, it's normal.

453
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,000
You won't sleep, huh?

454
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,280
You won't be able to get up
when the meteor shower comes.

455
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:27,800
I didn't intend to sleep.

456
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:30,000
I'm going to wait for the meteor shower.

457
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,760
Okay, just wait it out.
I'm sleeping now.

458
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,560
Boss, wake up.

459
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,840
If you sleep, I can't eat chips,

460
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,520
I can't look at my phone,

461
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,880
I can't do anything.

462
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:34,200
It's a meteor shower that only
comes once every 200 years.

463
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,360
If you fall asleep and miss it,
it'll be a pity.

464
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,200
Wait with me.

465
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,680
Boss.

466
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:47,760
All right. I'll wait with you?

467
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:49,960
Would you like to have some?

468
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,320
No.

469
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,760
(Luna Park.)

470
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:43,990
(I've never been to an amusement park.)

471
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:20,080
Siqi, wake up.

472
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,800
Wake up to watch the meteor shower.

473
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,440
It's time for it?

474
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,280
Boss, look. There's a meteor shower.

00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,760

476
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:04,120

♪That can be repeated by anyone else♪

479

Aren't you going to make a wish?

480
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,440
I don't need to make a wish.

481
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,440
My wish is to see a meteor shower.

482
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,120
It's already come true.

483
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,600
Thank you, Boss.

484
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:26,440
I'm very happy today.

Yuan.

488
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,240
Hui.

489
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:26,360
Our Valentine's Day gift boxes

490
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,720
are selling very well.

491
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:28,880
Thank you so much for your help.

492
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:29,920
Really?

493
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,880
I'm sure

494
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,680
you're very capable.

495
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:34,880
The winery

496
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,080
will get better under your leadership.

497
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,160
I believe that too.

498
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:42,760
Right, Yuan.

499
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,280
Why do you want to see me today?

500
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,320
Hui,

501
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,280
I'm leaving.

502
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,240
You're leaving?

503
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,280
Why are you leaving all of a sudden?

504
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:57,760
Mischief Man, walk slowly.

505
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,320
Okay.

506
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,520
Is it because of him?

507
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:07,960
Hi.

508
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:09,880
Mr. Xu is here.

509
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:10,920
Let's go.

510
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:16,960
Mr. Xu.

511
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,960
Dad.

512
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,400
Did you have a good night's sleep?

513
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,720
Yes, I did, Hui.

514
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,040
The breakfast was good, too.

515
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:24,320
- Everything is good.
- That's good, then.

516
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,160
Who is this?

517
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,760
I remember now.

518
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,360
This is his girlfriend.

519
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,040
Look,

520
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,080
don't you think they look
like a married couple?

521
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:40,600
Mind your words.

522
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:42,680
Dad,

523
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,000
what are you talking about?

524
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,120
This is Xia Yuan.

525
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,440
You remember Xia, don't you?

526
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:47,440
Xia?

527
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,480
Of course I remember Xia.

528
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,720
This is your girlfriend.

529
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:51,720
All right.

530
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:52,680
- Let's go eat.
- Let's go eat.

531
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:53,680
- Let's go eat.
- Let's go eat. All right.

532
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,800
When are you going to hold the wedding?

533
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:07,360
How was it? Thanks to me,

534
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:10,240
you were able to watch
such a beautiful meteor shower.

535
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,080
Without you,

536
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,880
the meteor shower would still come.

537
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,000
Without me,

538
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,640
you would only sleep at home.

539
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,560
Come on,

540
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,520
to celebrate you
unlocking a meteor shower,

541
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,640
what kind of reward
are you going to give me?

542
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,360
How about giving me a raise?

543
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,240
I can only give you

544
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,000
a week's nap.

545
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,400
That's good, too.

546
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,560
Thank you, Boss.

547
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,000
Please come in.

548
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,240
Hui.

549
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:55,760
Yuan,

550
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,560
in fact, we've been treating you

551
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,760
like family for a while now.

552
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,360
If you leave now,

553
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,560
I wonder

554
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,800
when we'll see each other again.

555
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,120
Don't worry.

556
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,560
With technology now,

557
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,680
you can call me

558
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,600
or make a video call with me.

559
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,360
I'll definitely come back to see you.

560
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,120
We're best friends.

561
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,680
Well, can you give me a

562
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,920
best-friend hug?

563
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:37,880
Thank you, Xia Yuan.

564
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,080
Take good care of Mr. Xu.

565
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,240
Mischief Man.

566
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,680
You are...

567
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:18,520
I'm sorry.

568
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,480
Sit down.

569
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:22,960
Mischief Man,

570
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:23,920
I'm leaving.

571
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,040
Don't ever

572
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,120
sneak a drink again.

573
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:28,480
Take care of yourself,

574
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,800
got it?

575
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:30,480
I got it.

576
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:31,920
I got it.

577
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:34,800
To be honest,

578
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,960
I've got it all written down.

579
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,320
Look.

580
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,960
Mischief Boy and Hui

581
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,800
won't let me drink.

582
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,720
There's more.

583
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:55,520
Wake up at 7:30 AM

584
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:58,040
to cook breakfast for Hui

585
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:02,200
and take him to school at 8 AM.

586
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,360
There's more here.

587
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,880
Get home at 7:30 PM

588
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:13,120
and have dinner with my wife and son.

589
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,640
At 8:30 PM,

590
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,560
we go for a walk along the river.

591
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,680
And there's one more.

592
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,920
Protect

593
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:29,920
Mischief Boy and Xia.

594
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:34,560
Mischief Boy doesn't eat spicy food.

595
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,280
Tell the kitchen

596
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,720
to cook without chili.

597
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,000
Good.

598
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,160
It's good that
you've written it all down.

599
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,840
That's a relief.

600
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:51,840
Well,

601
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,720
I'm leaving.

602
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,400
You're leaving?

603
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,200
Wait.

604
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,240
What's the matter?

605
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:09,760
I've always

606
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,240
had this money ready for you.

607
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,480
Don't let your mum see it.

608
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,440
Or she'll nag me again.

609
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:17,920
Spend it sparingly.

610
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,920
Don't be a spendthrift.

611
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,480
Son,

612
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,520
I know

613
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,680
it hasn't been

614
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,520
easy for you.

615
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,880
In the past, I forced you

616
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:36,400
to do things you didn't want to do.

617
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,680
When I think about it now,

618
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,720
I feel sorry for you.

619
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,840
Son,

620
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,880
I... I regret it.

621
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,520
Anyway, remember.

622
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,080
Wherever you go,

623
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,840
I'll be waiting for you at home.

624
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,120
I'll always protect you.

625
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,520
Okay.

626
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,120
Dad,

627
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:11,600
I love you.

628
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:15,200
Silly son,

629
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,240
I love you, too.

630
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,480
(Mischief Man,)

631
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,800
(I made up all sorts
of reasons to leave.)

632
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:36,280
(But in this moment,)

633
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,520
(I have realised)

634
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,400
(that I am the one
who is avoiding the reality.)

635
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,360
(Seeing you)

636
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,600
(reminds me of my dad.)

637
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,600
(I can't bear the thought of my dad)

638
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,200
(forgetting me little by little.)

639
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,080
(I'm sorry.)

640
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,120
(I'm leaving.)

641
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:00,840
(I hope all the good memories)

642
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,480
(stay in this moment.)

643
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:05,840
(Thank you)

644
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,080
(for bringing out the maturity in me.)
