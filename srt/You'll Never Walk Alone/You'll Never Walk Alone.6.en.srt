[Episode 6]

23
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:14,370
Hi, Kate.

24
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,600
Hey, Ben.

25
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:16,960
What is it?

26
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,840
I'd like to ask you a question.

27
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,560
Do you know Huo Mingxuan?

28
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,760
Mingxuan?

29
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,400
He's been working
in the farm for a month.

30
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,400
He's been doing great. Why do you ask?

31
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,080
Nothing. Just asking.

32
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,840
How much longer
is he going to work here?

33
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,120
Probably for another month.

34
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,200
That long?

35
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,960
Why?

36
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,240
Nothing.

37
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,160
By the way, Kate.

38
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,840
I have another favor to ask.

39
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,680
I'd like to ask for a loan.

40
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,360
No problem. How much?

41
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:50,400
200.

42
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,880
Thank you.

43
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,840
You're welcome.

44
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,040
- Bye.
- Bye.

45
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,040
I heard you like to cook
for other people, don't you?

46
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,600
Yeah. What's it got to do with you?

47
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,120
I don't care who you cook for,

48
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,760
but you can't cook for Siqi.

49
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,320
If you ever cook for her again,

50
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,960
I'll wallop you.

51
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,640
I like cooking for Siqi.

52
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,120
How is that your business?

53
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,880
Both of you are already divorced.

54
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,480
Looks like I need to take action.

55
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,680
Stop it!

56
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,520
How dare you lay a hand on my pal!

57
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,800
Stop fighting!

58
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:07,000
Break it off, guys!

59
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,920
Qiao Bin, you're here on a tourist visa.

60
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,080
- Don't get into trouble.
- Are you okay?

61
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,160
- I'm fine.
- Hao Weilai.

62
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,280
- I...
- Get out.

63
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,760
Get out!

64
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,040
Huo, are you okay?

65
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,200
I'm okay.

66
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,720
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

67
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm so sorry.

68
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,000
Here, let's get that wound disinfected.

69
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,000
This might be painful.

70
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,320
Be gentler.

71
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,480
What? I haven't even
applied the medicine.

72
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,080
Your wound is going to heal soon.

73
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,480
It's healing soon?

74
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,200
This is the worst injury I've ever had.

75
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:00,920
You hear me?

76
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,240
The worst injury?

77
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,040
Did you grow up in a crib?

78
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,640

of good-looking people.

80
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,120
You know?

81
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,440
I'm about to puke.

82
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,800
How did you get this wound?

83
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,080
And on this spot, of all places.

84
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,120
Xia Yuan, thank you.

85
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,880
Nothing. It's no biggie.

It's not just this.

88
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,280
All this time,

89
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,120
I think I've become more mature.

90
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,880
I've learned a lot of stuff.

91
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,280
And you were with me

92
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,680
throughout everything.

93
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,640
I may have been forced

94
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,560
to leave my comfort zone,

95
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,440
but

96
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,600
I've also received
a lot of unexpected surprises.

97
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,680
Thank you for your company and guidance.

98
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,440
Well,

99
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,880
the biggest credit goes to you.

100
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,960
I'm just a...

101
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,120
What do they call it in games?

102
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,400
Some kind of...

103
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:01,960
Sup...

104
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,200
Support?

105
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,280
Support.

106
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,840
Like a nanny.

107
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,160
Yeah. Over here, nanny.

108
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:07,840
Heal my HP.

109
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,000
You're the nanny-goat here.

110
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,920
Okay, this is going to sting.

111
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,600
Blow.

112
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,160
Done.

113
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:57,880
Keep your wound away

114
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,360
from water for the next three days.

115
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:04,880
Well...

116
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,440
Remember to apply medicine regularly.

117
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,520
I'm going to wash my hands.

118
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,600
That's it?

119
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,080
My wound is reopening.
Give it another blot.

120
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,240
Siqi.

121
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,800
Are you free tonight?

122
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,800
Let's go out for a stroll.

123
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,440
No, thanks. I already have a date.

124
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,440
What about tomorrow?

125
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,800
Tomorrow's not a good day, too.

126
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,560
I won't have any free time lately.

127
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,920
So, is Qiao Bin

128
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,960
staying here forever?

129
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,560
Is that any of your business?

130
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,440
Hello, how can I help you?

131
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,000
Hi, is this the immigration office?

132
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,800
It's been so long
since I've felt so relaxed.

133
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,600
You should relax more often.

134
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,160
Don't be grumpy all the time

135
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,240
like when I first met you.

136
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,640
I wasn't grumpy.

137
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,480
But, it's true that
I was stressed out in the past.

138
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,160
There were unending calls every day.

139
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,320
Yeah.

140
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,360
Plans get disrupted all the time.

141
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,600
I was even planning

142
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,080
to list my studio
on the market in three years' time.

143
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,160
Look.

144
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,200
You do it.

145
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,440
Here I am, skipping stones with you.

146
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,400
And what's wrong with that?

147
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,200
You look like a happy kid.

148
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,440
Yeah.

149
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,880
I'm a pro.

150
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:45,800
Siqi.

151
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,600
Can't you stop following me

152
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,360
around all the time?

153
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,760
The weather's great.

154
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,600
I'm just joining you for a stroll.

155
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,240
Yuan, help me.

156
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,360
Look at me.

157
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,760
Not bad, Qiao Bin.

158
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,000
Nice. Try this.

159
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,360
What's this?

160
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,000
Is this going to work?

161
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,960
Childish.

162
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,960
How is that childish?
You can't even make it skip.

163
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,760
Try it.

164
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,480
This game is so easy.

165
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,000
Madam.

166
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,840
Hi, can I ask what this is about?

167
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:47,040
My name is James,
and here's my colleague, John.

168
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,000
We're from the immigration office.

169
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,840
We got a report

170
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,960
claiming you have
illegal labor at your farm

171
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:53,720
working without proper visas.

172
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,240
Please help us with the investigation.

173
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:56,800
Look,

174
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,360
I'm willing to help you
anywhere possible, but

175
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,520
we don't have any illegal workers here.

176
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,600
I'm sorry,

177
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,960
but we need to investigate first.

178
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,560
According to our regulations,

179
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,200
we need to check the whole farm.

180
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,440
Also, please get all the workers

181
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,960
together.

182
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,960
Understand. I'll just bring them here.

183
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,280
Have a seat.

184
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,280
You're no better than her.

185
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,320
Need any tips?

186
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,080
I've been looking everywhere for you.

187
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,320
Some officers from
the immigration office are here.

188
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,000
We need to gather.

189
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,080
The immigration office?
Why are they here?

190
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,120
They said they received a tip-off

191
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,040
that we have illegal workers here.

192
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,520
Illegal workers? Impossible.

193
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:43,680
Our working documents

194
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,200
are all in order.

195
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,480
We do have working visas,

196
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,880
but Qiao Bin is here on a tourist visa.

197
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,640
If they suspect that Qiao Bin

198
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,320
is working illegally here,

199
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,600
he might get deported.

200
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,000
I'm not even paid.

201
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,640
How is that counted as working?

202
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,800
They wouldn't come for no reason.

203
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,840
I'm worried that someone is behind this.

204
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,080
Let's gather at the yard soon.

205
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,680
Take your documents with you.

206
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,480
Let's take our documents.

207
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,920
We should be fine.

208
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,080
Okay.

209
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,920
So, here are all your workers, right?

210
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:26,840
Yes, we've just entered
the harvest season,

211
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,480
so we have more workers
than we usually would.

212
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,520
How many Chinese workers
are in the farm?

213
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,920
Apparently, we have three.

214
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,440
Yeah, three of us.

215
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,040
I have to check their passports.

216
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:42,800
Can I have yours?

217
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,560
And yours.

218
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,440
So, I've checked everyone.

219
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,480
Everyone is okay.

220
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,280
Okay.

221
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,280
Are you sure you don't have

222
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,400
any other Chinese here?

223
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,880
I'm positive.

224
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,880
Okay, thank you.

225
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,320
Take this.

226
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,280
Wait, that's not him.

227
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,360
The guy in the video.

228
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,640
Yes.

229
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,160
Excuse me.

230
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,680
We think the guy in the video

231
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,760
we have is not this one.

232
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,280
Come, please check.

233
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,960
That's Ben. He's just a friend.

234
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,400
He's not a worker.

235
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,360
And where is he now?

236
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,280
I don't know.

237
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:52,920
Can we please check inside?

238
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:55,000
This is our warrant.

239
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,840
Please open the door.

240
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,360
Feel free to look around.

241
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,440
Okay.

242
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,320
Is everything okay?

243
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:18,000
They're looking for Ben.
I know he's around here somewhere,

244
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,200
but I don't know where.

245
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,080
Ben isn't even working here.

246
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:23,480
Yeah, but that's not
what looks like to them.

247
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,480
The guy on the video
is taking money from me.

248
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:27,520
I'm just lending it to him.

249
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,520
How do I explain that way?

250
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,960
Yeah, yeah.

251
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,160
Not a thing.

252
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,200
Yep.

253
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,800
We're really sorry for the troubles.

254
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,760
We'll be leaving now.

255
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,520
Snake!

256
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:42,760
Hi.

257
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,160
Wait.

258
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,080
Who are you?

259
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,040
That's my friend, Ben,

260
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,760
that we're just talking about.

261
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:53,440
Okay.

262
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,080
So, we'll need to take him
for some questions.

263
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,280
Sir, please.

264
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,280
Well,

265
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,760
we have to take him in
for the investigation.

266
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,600
What should we do, Yuan?

267
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,080
Yuan, think of something.

268
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,320
What's going on?

269
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,360
(No.)

270
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,400
(I need to save Qiao Bin.)

271
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,120
He was reported?

272
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,280
It must have been Huo Mingxuan.

273
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,200
Only he would harbor
a grudge against Qiao Bin.

274
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:53,640
No way.
He wouldn't stoop so low, would he?

275
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,880
Is that the immigration office?

276
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,960
"I regretted soon after
I made that call.

277
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,480
Now that I've reported him, I know

278
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,120
there's no way
I can get you back anymore.

279
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:16,920
I hope my impulsive actions

280
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,440
did not bring you much trouble,

281
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,200
and that you wouldn't hate me.

282
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,200
I have already left the farm.

283
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,760
I wish you happiness."

284
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,440
It really is him!

285
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,720
"Wish you happiness"? Phooey!

286
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,000
What a jerk!

287
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,440
See? And you trusted him?

288
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,600
Kate, at this point,

289
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,280
Ben could be prosecuted as an illegal.

290
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,240
He could get deported.

291
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,160
And our farm could face punishments.

292
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,840
I think we need to hire a lawyer.

293
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,120
Mum.

294
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:52,320
We can't afford a lawyer like that.

295
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,520
Plus, he's innocent.

296
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,600
Okay, I don't think
we need to get flustered.

297
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,760
I'm sure there's something we can do.

298
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,320
Don't worry, everyone.

299
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,120
Let's all think carefully.

300
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,680
There must be a way.

301
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,840
Kate, if the situation arises,

302
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,720
can you testify for us?

303
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,240
No problem.

304
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,760
Thank you.

305
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,360
Relax.

306
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,640
I just want to ask you some questions.

307
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,680
Where are you from?

308
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:35,640
China.

309
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:38,640
How long have you been in this country?

310
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,120
About one month.

311
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,560
Are you a worker in this farm?

312
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:44,640
No.

313
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,640
Have you received
any salary from this farm?

314
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:56,080
No, but I asked Kate to borrow money.

315
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,360
So, what are you doing in this farm?

316
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,320
To find my ex-wife.

317
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,600
If that's so,

318
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:14,000
why did you hide from us?

319
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,960
Because my English is not good,

320
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,680
and I'm afraid I can't explain it.

321
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,120
The immigration office took him away

322
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,120
because they suspected
that he was working on a tourist visa.

323
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,400
If he's found guilty,

324
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,320
he would be deported.

325
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:38,560
The point is,

326
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,640
it'll implicate the Smiths as well.

327
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,360
Let him go, then.

328
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,480
He keeps showing up
in front of me every day.

329
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,520
So annoying.

330
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,080
Still, we dragged
the Smiths down this time.

331
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,400
Anyway, it's Qiao Bin's fault too.

332
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,280
He didn't do anything wrong,

333
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,560
he's not working,
and it's not illegal to borrow money.

334
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,320
Why was he hiding?

335
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,000
If he didn't hide,

336
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,280
nothing would have happened.

337
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,600
The worst guy here
is your boy, Huo Mingxuan.

338
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,240
He's a jerk.

339
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,600
What do you mean, my boy?

340
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,520
What's it got to do with me?

341
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,440
How is it not your business?

342
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,720
You brought him here,

343
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,040
elf.

344
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,000
That's them. I'm me.

345
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,640
What do you mean, you're you?

346
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,920
You're his wife, right?

347
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,760
Qiao Bin came to look for you.

348
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,120
You need to explain
to the immigration office.

349
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,640
How am I his wife?

350
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,880
I'm his ex-wife.

351
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,560
At least you can prove it.

352
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,560
I don't have a marriage certificate,

353
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,960
but I do have the divorce papers.

354
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,840
That's proof anyway.
Why are you still standing here?

355
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,760
Take those papers and bail him out.

356
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,480
Go.

357
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,040
She really brought those papers?

358
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:48,320
Do you think they can still make up?

359
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,720
Come on.

360
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,000
Let me do some research.

361
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,040
Hope there's something useful.

362
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,320
It'll be fine. Don't get flustered.

363
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,240
Just explain everything,
and it'll be okay.

364
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:05,840
Just a while longer.

365
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,440
Hello.

366
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,560
Hi.

367
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,200
Please, have a seat.

368
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:21,440
Okay, let's talk about Mr. Qiao.

369
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,760
Okay, we're Mr. Qiao's friends.

370
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,040
He has arrived here for one month,

371
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,400
and we can prove that.

372
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,440
He's not an illegal worker.

373
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:33,920
Mr. Qiao's here to visit his ex-wife.

374
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,280
And she's right here.

375
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,720
I'm his ex-wife.

376
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,880
He's here to visit me.

377
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,520
So, how do you explain the video?

378
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,400
It's obvious that the video

379
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,360
was taken without consent.

380
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:48,120
It cannot be used as evidence.

381
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,120
And the money that you saw on the video,

382
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,040
I lent him as a friend.

383
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,360
This is a signed affidavit
from me and my family.

384
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,120
We can guarantee
that Mr. Qiao has never done any kind of

385
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:59,720
illegal work at the farm.

386
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,600
You can interview the other workers.

387
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,360
They will all say the same thing.

388
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,040
Yeah.

389
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,320
I've never given him a salary.

390
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,440
Siqi.

391
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,800
The divorce papers.

392
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,800
These are our divorce papers.

393
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,000
I have to check it.

394
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,840
But, for now,

395
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,480
I believe you.

396
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,280
Thank you, sir.

397
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:35,240
Mr. Qiao is free to go.

398
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,720
Thank you.

399
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,920
If I will have any further questions,

400
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,480
I will contact you.

401
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,560
Yes, sir.

402
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,000
Now, please follow me.

403
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,360
Anyway,

404
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:03,280
I'd like to thank everyone today.

405
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,240
The rescue plan was a huge success.

406
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:06,840
I can't ever repay you.

407
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,160
I can only

408
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,120
salute each and every one of you.

409
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,440
I'm not drinking.

410
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:12,760
It's your problem,

411
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,640
and we had to solve it for you.

412
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,160
Sorry, Siqi.

413
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,680
I know

414
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:19,560
I'm kind of dumb,

415
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:20,880
but...

416
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,640
Come on, let's all drink together.

417
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,320
Yeah,

418
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,920
he said the rescue plan was a success,

419
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,720
and it really was.

420
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:28,360
Cheers.

421
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:30,080
- Yeah.
- Drink up.

422
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,360
Anyway, since you saved my life,

423
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,160
I will have to repay with mine.

424
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,720
I think all of us here

425
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,680
are pretty clever, good job.

426
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,840
Why are you nodding? Except you.

427
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,480
You're dumb.

428
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,000
I realized

429
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,160
both of you are experts
at saving people.

430
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:00,640
You saved my skin last time,
and now it's Qiao Bin's.

431
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,280
The next one will be...

432
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,840
Next one? My foot.

433
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,960
Why would you want that
to happen, dumb girl?

434
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,240
Cheers to the dumb kids here.

435
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,160
Cheers. God will still watch over you.

436
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:12,800
Wishing everyone success.

437
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:13,400
Cheers.

438
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,320
Yes, okay.

439
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,240
Okay, thank you.

440
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:21,480
If you have any news about Song,

441
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,120
please let me know.

442
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,200
Okay, thank you.

443
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,360
Bye.

444
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:38,280
Yuan, any news about Song Hangyu?

445
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,160
I've contacted

446
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,400
many friends in Europe,

447
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,560
but they don't have any news.

448
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,520
I've sent him so many emails,

449
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,360
hoping for a reply,

450
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,040
but the only replies I've gotten
are automatic emails.

451
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,760
Human relationships are so fragile.

452
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,880
When one person

453
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,640
is determined to sever all ties,

454
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,880
there's absolutely nothing
the other person can do.

455
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:19,280
See, all I can look at

456
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,400
are a bunch of automatic replies

457
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,840
and red exclamation marks.

458
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:28,440
Yuan, God will never let anyone down.

459
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,840
It's just that the time hasn't come.

460
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:35,480
Siqi, you're a big girl now.

461
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,080
You've learned
how to console other people.

462
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,360
I hope so.

463
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,760
Am I really that dumb?

464
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:59,160
Every time I try to make Siqi happy,

465
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:02,600
it always ends in disaster.

466
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,400
You've been talking about you and Siqi

467
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,400
over and over.

468
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,320
I'm sick of the same old stories.

469
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,960
Drink up.

470
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:14,320
Song is such a sneaky guy, you know?

471
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,480
- Listen...
- He owes me the money,

472
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,680
- and suddenly he disappears.
- Shh, you're drunk. Sleep tight.

473
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:24,400
Wait, isn't his family in China?

474
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,080
I can call his family.

475
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,240
He's always careful.

476
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:32,080
He never told anyone about his family.

477
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,160
Hey, what's up?

478
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:35,760
Hey, man.

479
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,240
Cheers.

480
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,000
- Cheers, man.
- Cheers.

481
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,400
Nice to see you.

482
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,800
Nice to meet you too, bro.

483
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,040
I heard you talking
about someone named Song.

484
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,920
Is it this guy?

485
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,960
That's him.

486
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:01,720
Wait, where did you get this picture?

487
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,240
You know him?

488
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,640
The girl in the picture is my sister.

489
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,200
Song hurt my sister so badly.

490
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,320
He didn't just hurt my sister,

491
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:15,440
but so many good guys,

492
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,120
so I must find him.

493
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,080
He's such a shitty guy.

494
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:18,480
Yeah.

495
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,480
I've been looking for him
for a long time.

496
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,000
He's always hiding from us.

497
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,640
He showed up one time at the warehouse.

498
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,840
Which warehouse?

499
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,240
Please, I must find him.

500
00:27:35,240 --> 00:27:37,360
I need him to pay for that.

501
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,040
Well,

502
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:43,160
the warehouse with a lot of containers.

503
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,280
Could you type the address for me?

504
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,560
Sure.

505
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,240
Here's the place.

506
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,360
Thank you so much.

507
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,440
You're welcome.

508
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,080
Cheers.

509
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,440
Their drinks are on me.

510
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,920
Thanks, man.

511
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,160
Thanks.

512
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,960
It's already noon,
and he's still in bed?

513
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,440
You mean Qiao Bin?
He had too much to drink last night.

514
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,560
He was singing and dancing in his room

515
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,120
until morning, when he finally slept.

516
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,520
Xia Yuan.

517
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,320
This is your salary for last week.

518
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,480
Thank you.

519
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,520
So much?

520
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,480
All the work here has been completed.

521
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,800
The extra money is to thank you

522
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,000
for your hard work recently.

523
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,800
What do you mean?

524
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:05,000
All the work here is completed, so...

525
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:06,800
Yes.

526
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:11,080
The farm's seasonal work
is about to end.

527
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,480
We won't be needing so many workers now.

528
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:17,320
But I love the farm life.

529
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,120
Actually, I'd hate
to see you go as well.

530
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,960
Must we leave today?

531
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,600
No, I'm not here to shoo you.

532
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,600
Until you find your next job,

533
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,400
of course you can
continue staying at the farm.

534
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,160
Thank you.

535
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,640
Thank you, Kate.

536
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:02,320
Xia Yuan, why are you all alone here?

537
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,600
Kate. I'm just about to leave.

538
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:08,520
I'm just walking and looking around.

539
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,120
You guys

540
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:13,240
were an awesome presence at the farm,

541
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,360
but our work here

542
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,760
is about to end for now.

543
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:19,040
Kate, I'm really glad

544
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,280
that my first job in Europe

545
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,160
is at your farm.

546
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,280
I can feel

547
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,360
that you have a kind, warm heart.

548
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,840
We may have started off
on the wrong foot,

549
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,240
but it's all in the past.

550
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,760
Let's take a walk there.

551
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,280
Sure.

552
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:39,880
So, any plans after this?

553
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,520
Probably just sightseeing.

554
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,400
After all, one year isn't a long time.

555
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,480
There are many things I haven't done.

556
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,280
I was asking about Song.

557
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:54,960
About Song Hangyu?

558
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,760
The only clue I have is your farm.

559
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,240
Now that the trail has gone cold,

560
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,960
after this,

561
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,360
I can only work and search
at the same time.

562
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,080
Are you that determined to find him?

563
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,160
There are things that have to be said

564
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,720
before I can let them go.

565
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,040
You're insistent.

566
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,760
I hope my insistence

567
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,200
can bring me good news.

568
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,160
Xia Yuan.

569
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,120
I want you to know

570
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:35,400
that Song Hangyu

571
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,880
isn't the only man in this world.

572
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,680
Stop feeling sad over him, okay?

573
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,960
Don't worry, Kate.

574
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,760
I'll take good care of myself.

575
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,000
I also hope

576
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,760
that you can move on soon.

577
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,880
That's enough talking for now. Let's go.

578
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,080
This will be our last delivery.

579
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,520
I will miss my time here.

580
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,280
Yeah.

581
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,840
Where are we? Is this the wrong place?

582
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:05,000
I was thinking that we're leaving soon,

583
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:06,840
so we should take some time
to admire the scenery.

584
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,840
Xia Yuan.

585
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,840
Any plans after leaving here?

586
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,480
I don't know either.

587
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,880
Just take one step at a time.

588
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:39,800
Thank you, Xia Yuan.

589
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,120
If it weren't for you,

590
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,680
I wouldn't be here.

591
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:47,080
I'd probably be sleeping on the streets.

592
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,320
I think you're a kind girl,

593
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,640
so I want to help you.

594
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,640
If you're still insistent

595
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,400
on finding Song Hangyu,

596
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,920
I'll help you look for him.

597
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,240
I got this address

598
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,240
from someone.

599
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,480
Kate told me

600
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,840
about a bar that Song Hangyu frequented,

601
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,480
so I waited there every day,

602
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,840
and I heard from someone

603
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,080
about Song Hangyu's whereabouts.

604
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:46,760
Thank you, Hao Weilai.

605
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,680
I'm so sad that you will all go.

606
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,280
We're wishing you
the best in everything you do,

607
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,880
and I hope you come back to the farm

608
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,400
someday to see us.

609
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,440
Thank you, Mrs. Smith.

610
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,600
Thank you.

611
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,280
Thank you for everything
you've done for the farm

612
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,320
and bringing out so much joy.

613
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,920
You'll always be a part of our family.

614
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,360
Next year,

615
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,960
if you're free then,

616
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,720
we welcome you
to work in our farm again.

617
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,720
Xia Yuan.

618
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,840
When you first came,

619
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,440
I wasn't very nice to you.

620
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,480
I hope you can forgive me.

621
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,760
We're getting along well now.

622
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,360
We're good friends.

623
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,920
Let's take a photo together

624
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:09,680
as a memento.

625
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,440
Sure, okay.

626
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,320
Here.

627
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:16,920
Three, two, one, cheese!

628
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,200
[Kaisereversdorf]

629
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:48,960
Excuse me, sir.

630
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:49,520
Can I help you?

631
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,080
I want to find my friend.

632
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,440
His name is Song Hangyu.

633
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:54,480
Have you seen this person before?

634
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,400
No, never seen him.

635
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,280
No?

636
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,160
Never seen him, sorry.

637
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:02,840
Okay, fine.

638
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,000
Can we go inside to have a look?

639
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:05,520
Sorry,

640
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,480
but that's the rule, I can't let you in.

641
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,240
Please.

642
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,360
No, that's the rules.

643
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,320
Sorry, I can't let you in.

644
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,160
Are you from China?

645
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,600
You can speak Chinese?

646
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:23,600
We're looking for someone.

647
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,760
We're all from China.

648
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,360
We're looking for a fellow Chinese.

649
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,400
My friend said

650
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,160
he used to work here.

651
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,040
Song Hangyu?

652
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,480
You know him?

653
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:38,160
He seems to have worked here before.

654
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:39,080
Really?

655
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,560
Where is he now?

656
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,200
That was quite some time ago.

657
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,280
I forgot.

658
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,640
Why don't you come to my office,

659
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,480
and I can go through his files?

660
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,600
Is that convenient for you?

661
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,440
Yes, it is.

662
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,400
Thank you.

663
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:51,680
Let me take a look inside.

664
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,440
Don't worry.

665
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,440
Wait for me here.

666
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,960
Siqi, I'll be back soon.

667
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:55,840
We're going as well.

668
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:56,720
Stop.

669
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,120
- Why?
- Not you.

670
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,320
We're going to have a look inside too.

671
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,680
Why? She just went inside.

672
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,880
No, that's the rules. Sorry.

673
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:16,640
Why?

674
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,000
I can't let you in.

675
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:19,880
What should we do?

676
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:20,880
We'll wait a while.

677
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,200
Have a seat.

678
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,280
Thank you.

679
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,640
I'm Loris, the boss here.

680
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,920
Mr. Loris.

681
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,920
I'm Xia Yuan.

682
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:00,040
I heard that Song Hangyu
has worked here before,

683
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:01,480
so I came here to find him.

684
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,360
I remember a bit about him,

685
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,480
but he has resigned a long time ago.

686
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,440
Do you have his employee files,

687
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:10,080
or any contact details or addresses?

688
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,480
We just renovated this place,

689
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,160
and our employee database
is still kind of messy,

690
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,920
so I can't guarantee we can find them.

691
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,280
Siqi.

692
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,400
Sit down. Don't stand there.

693
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:25,880
Can't you see that I'm wearing a skirt?

694
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,040
Qiao Bin.

695
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,200
You agreed

696
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,480
that you wouldn't follow us,

697
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,280
so why are you tagging along now?

698
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,960
Go away, go away!

699
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,920
Where else can I go?

700
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,080
If you won't go, I'm going.

701
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,120
No, no.

702
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,120
I'll go.

703
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,600
I'm counting on you.

704
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,480
You guys always bicker

705
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,680
whenever you're together, how annoying.

706
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,800
Well, Qiao Bin

707
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,720
may not be emotionally perceptive,

708
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:18,200
but he's still a decent guy.

709
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:22,080
He's what we call

710
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,080
the brawn-over-brain type.

711
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,120
You should know that very well.

712
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,720
We're in a foreign land
with strangers everywhere.

713
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,880
If,

714
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,320
and I mean if,

715
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,880
if anything happens,

716
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,640
what would we do?

717
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,840
I won't be responsible for that.

718
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,200
You shooed him away.

719
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,160
Yeah.

720
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,480
Hao Weilai.

721
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,960
Why don't you go search for him?

722
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,480
What about Yuan?

723
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:48,640
You think you can protect her?

724
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,400
So, I have to search for him?

725
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:54,960
Of course you have to.

726
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,840
Solve your own problems
that you created.

727
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:57,920
I'm off, then.

728
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,800
Take care of Yuan.

729
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,040
Yes.

730
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:17,880
Excuse me, but may I know

731
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,280
why you're looking for him?

732
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:22,840
Sorry.

733
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,760
It's okay if you don't want to tell me.

734
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,360
He's my fiance.

735
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,120
He suddenly disappeared

736
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,480
on the day of our engagement.

737
00:41:36,080 --> 00:41:38,880
That's why I came all the way here.

738
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,120
Then, I heard

739
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,640
he used to work here,

740
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:44,160
so I'm trying to see
if there are any clues here.

741
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,960
Looks like you are an insistent

742
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,320
and loyal person.

743
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,440
I'll help you look for him.

744
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:51,240
I have many Chinese friends here,

745
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,520
and I'll ask them for you.

746
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,760
Give me some time.

747
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,040
Thank you, Mr. Loris.

748
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:01,280
Xia Yuan.

749
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,080
Well? Any clues?

750
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,320
Not for now.

751
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:14,440
Where are Siqi and Qiao Bin?

752
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:16,480
They're arguing again.

753
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,360
Come on.

754
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,880
Let's walk while I fill you in.

755
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,440
Did that guy tell you

756
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,960
anything about Song Hangyu?

757
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,400
He said Song Hangyu
did work for him before,

758
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,480
but he doesn't know where he is now.

759
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,200
He told me he'd help me, though.

760
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,200
He asked me to stay here and wait.

761
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,680
How do you know
if he's not deceiving you?

762
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,120
He doesn't know
where Song Hangyu is either.

763
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,040
Who knows, he was lying to you.

764
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,280
Hao Weilai.

765
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,400
Let's go back.

766
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,160
Back where?

767
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,280
You'll know when we're there.

768
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:52,960
Come on.

769
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:53,920
Come on!
