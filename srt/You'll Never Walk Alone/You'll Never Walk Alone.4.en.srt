I'm not a thief.
This is my friend's house.

I used to live here all the time.

Fine.

98
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:54,840
Well, just text me if you need

00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,560
any help after this.

100
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,160
Sure.

101
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,600
Stay safe.

102

Hello? Sis.

103
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,320
What are you up to?

104
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,040
Can you transfer some money to me?

105

109
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,960
I only have 100 Euros left.

110
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,800
I'm dying here.

111
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,120
Fine. You want to watch me die,

112
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,040
don't you?

113
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,240
Please, sis. I'm serious.

114
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,200
If I had any other option,

115
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,360
I wouldn't have called and begged you.

116
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,720
I don't even know where to stay tonight.

117
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,960

"Huo"?

123
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,240
You addressed him so affectionately.
Are you even close with him?

124
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,920
Do you even know this handsome young man

125
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,040
from Hong Kong, China well? And you're
already going on a date with him.

126
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:37,560
Whatever! Let's stop with the talk.

127
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,840
I'm going to be late. See you!

128
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,720
Ye Siqi, come back earlier!

129
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:43,320
Okay!

130
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,920
She only has eyes for Huo.

131
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,400
Hao Weilai, what happened?

132
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,160
My wallet was stolen.

133
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,360
How did that happen?

134
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,400
I made a phone call, and it was gone.

135
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:14,720
Are you okay, physically?

136
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,680
Not really.

137
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,960
What's wrong?

138
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,680
I'm hungry.

139
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,440
Let's go.

140
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,280
Where?

141
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,000
For a meal.

142

Yes, let's go.

144

Hurry up.

145
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,000
Huo, how long have you stayed here?

146
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,280
Over a month.
I happen to be on my study break,

147
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:03,840
so I'm working at a few places.

148
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,320
Let me show you around here.

149
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,280
Okay.

150
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,560
What are you studying?

151
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,240
Business Administration.

152
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,440
I see.

153
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,520
It sounds impressive.

154
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:15,800
That's awesome.

155
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,960
Thank you.

156
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,320
Huo, look! There's a fish.

157
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,360
Yes, it's there.
There's one over there too.

158
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,880
You're right!
This place is really beautiful.

159
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,440
Don't worry,

160
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,240
I'll definitely handle her for you.

161
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,680
Isn't she just a little girl?

162
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,040
It'll be easy-peasy.

163
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,320
I'm in her room right now.

164
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,280
She should be back in a while.

165
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,960
I certainly won't mess up this time.

166
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,800
If it works, cheer up.

167
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:51,880
What are you doing?

168
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,480
What's wrong with you?

169
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,160
It's me!

170
00:10:58,080 --> 00:10:59,600
Are you dumb?

171
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:09,600
How is it? Any better?

172
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,680
Is it still reddish?

173
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:13,200
A bit.

174
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,240
I'm so unlucky.

175
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,520
I don't even know
what kind of luck I'm having.

176
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,000
What?

177
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,960
I'm sorry.

178
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,000
It was because you were sneaking
around in there.

179
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,880
That's nonsense!

180
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,720
It was you who had bad eyes.

181
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,400
Well, I've apologized!

182
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,960
Come on, let me check it.

183
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,160
It's just a minor injury.
You'll be fine by tomorrow.

184
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,080
I'm sure it won't leave any scars.

185
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,960
I'm serious!

186
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,480
How do you want me
to make it up to you then?

187
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,920
Tonight...

188
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,880
What are you going to do?

189
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,880
I'll take your bed,
while you sleep on the floor.

190
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,120
- It's a deal!
- No way!

191
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,360
Yuan, look at him!

192
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,960
How come it stopped hurting
all of a sudden?

193
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,960
How comfortable!

194
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,920
It's okay, you can sleep with me.

195
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,440
(Who is this?)

196
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,960
(I'm so angry.)

197
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,720
(This won't do,)

198
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,200
(I must go and see her!)

199
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,280
So, what would you like to speak about?

200
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,360
Is it him? It's that guy from last time.

201
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,120
Well, Mrs. Smith,

202
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,640
he's my friend. His name is Future.

203
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,880
His wallet was stolen yesterday.

204
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,960
So,

205
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:59,160
he has no money and homeless.

206
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,080
Would you be able to keep him,

207
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,920
and let him work with us by any chance?

208
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,040
Honey, I really like you, but...

209
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:13,120
I don't know if Kate
will be able to accept him too.

210
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,000
It was just a bad
misunderstanding last time.

211
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,440
I promise, Mrs. Smith,

212
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,480
he's a kind person.

213
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,560
Mrs. Smith,

214
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,640
I'm so sorry for last time when we met.

215
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,920
If you give me a chance,

216
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,960
I will work very hard.

217
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,160
If you don't let me stay,

218
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,200
I will be homeless.

219
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:42,840
Please.

220
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,040
I'll need to see your visa.

221
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,160
Thank you.

222
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,040
Your visa's okay.

223
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,880
You can stay.

224
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:03,760
I'll tell Kate.

225
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,080
Thank you! Thank you very much!
Thank you.

226
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,640
You are so kind.

227
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,880
Yes! This is amazing! Xia Yuan,

228
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,280
I'm definitely going to do my best here.

229
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,960
All right, stop talking big.

230
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,320
You couldn't even guard your own wallet.

231
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,160
Working here,

232
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:21,360
the most important thing
is to be serious and down-to-earth.

233
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,840
Don't worry.

234
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,800
Since you've vouched for me,

235
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,040
I'll be sure to do my job well

236
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,640
and won't embarrass you.

237
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,960
Come on, I'll show you around.

238
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,480
Let's go there.

239
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,360
This is your dorm.

240
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,600
Let's go in and check it out first.

241
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,920
I thought no one was inside.

242
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,200
I'm so sorry!

243
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,520
Wait, don't look.

244
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,880
Hey, what's up? Are you the newcomer?

245
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,320
Yes, nice to meet you.

246
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,160
I'm Future.

247
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:02,960
"Future"? Good name.

248
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,880
I'm Peter.

249
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,360
Nice to meet you, bro.

250
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,040
- Hi.
- This is my girl.

251
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,960
I'm Mary. Nice to meet you.

252
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,800
So first, I'm living here
for a few months,

253
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:16,200
and I'm going to take
the right bed, okay?

254
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,560
Yeah, you can see.

255
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,720
And also, I don't like anyone
to touch my stuff,

256
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,400
including my sports equipment,

257
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,600
and her.

258
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,360

00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,560

260
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,040
I'll wait for you outside.

261
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,160
I'll show you where we work later on.

262
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:38,440
Sure.

263
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,840
I'll be quick.

264
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,160
That was fast.

265
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,480
Yes, I didn't want to disturb them.

266
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,440
- Let's go.
- Okay.

267
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,560
It stinks!

No, I don't want to go there!

00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,840
What does it have to do with my sister?

371
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,840
Just punish us if you want to.

372
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:16,120
That's right. It was us who fished.

373
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,400
She had nothing to do with it.

374
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,480
I'm talking to you!

375
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:23,680
Forget it. Let it go.

376
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,480
Say, why is she always targeting you?

377
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,320
Or

378
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,840
is she jealous that you're
prettier than her?

379
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,520
Okay, stop talking nonsense.

380
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,280
I'll go and move the goods now,

381
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,840
or else Kate will punish me again
if she sees me here.

382
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,040
Xia Yuan, don't go.

383
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:38,360
What does this matter
have to do with you?

384
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,840
They were the ones fishing, no?
She should go then.

385
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,440
How come we're the only ones
who fished now?

386
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,320
What about you?

387
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,360
When did I fish?

388
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,920
I only touched it for a second.
Does that count?

389
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,720
Yes, of course it does!

390
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,640
All of us fished together!

391
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,920
I just touched the rod,

392
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,640
and that's considered fishing?

393
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,560
Well, why didn't you
tell this to Kate just now?

394
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:54,720
Didn't I say that I...

395
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,440
That's enough. Siqi, knock it off.

396
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,800
You too.

397
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,040
I'll go and move the goods now.

398
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,360
You guys should hurry back
to the orchard.

399
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,280
Otherwise, Kate will punish all of us

400
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,120
if she sees us here. Let's go.

401
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,360
We'll pass! Both of us will go.

402
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,040
You stay.

403
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:07,280
What's the matter with you?

404
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:08,400
It wasn't you who fished.

405
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,000
Just head back to the orchard, you two.

406
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,360
Yuan!

407
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,760
It's all your fault!

408
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,720
What does it have to do with me?

409
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,120
All I did was touch the rod!

410
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,080
I did volunteer to move the goods, no?

411
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,600
And you're blaming me?
What do I have to do with it?

412
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,800
Anybody here?

413
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,760
Who is it?

414
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,960
It's me.

415
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,720
Who are you?

416
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,680
Weilai.

417
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,120
Well...

418
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,520
Can I stay over

419
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,240
at your place tonight?

420
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,960
No way!

421
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:20,560
Please!

422
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,960
Peter's girlfriend has been spending

423
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,360
the last two nights in our dorm.

424
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,840
So?

425
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,560
Well, we're all adults.

426
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,080
You know the rest.

427
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,680
I beg of you. Please take pity on me

428
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,720
and let me stay here for the night.

429
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:44,920
Come on in.

430
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,680
Help!

431
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,360
Why did you scream?
You scared me to death!

432
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,360
What's wrong with you?

433
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,560
There was a huge spider over there!

434
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:19,560
It was as big as a crab!

435
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:20,600
It's a crab then!

436
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:22,480
It's a spider! Over there!

437
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,400
Get off my bed!

438
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:24,680
That...

439
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:25,960
It's over there!

440
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,080
Where?

441
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,520
Go away!

442
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,120
Where is it?

443
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:35,640
Under the table.

444
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,680
You're such a chicken.
There's no spider!

445
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:40,560
Coward.

446
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,440
Give me that! Get off my bed!

447
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,400
What are you doing? Get moving!

448
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:47,480
Get out of my bed! Go!

449
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,000
Do not come up here or say a word!

450
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,640
Siqi, turn off the lights.
Just ignore him.

451
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,160
Hao Weilai, you do it.

452
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,520
Hi, Chris.

453
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:31,080
Hi.

454
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,320
Hi, Jason.

455
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,680
Hey.

456
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,720
How long have you worked here?

457
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:36,960
One year.

458
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,560
One year? Okay.

459
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,280
Have you heard of a person
named "Song Hangyu"?

460
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,360
Nope.

461
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,040
But, you can ask someone else.

462
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:48,800
Okay, thank you.

463
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:50,040
- You're welcome.
- You're welcome.

464
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:50,560
Bye.

465
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:51,680
- Bye.
- Bye.

466
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,280
Hi.

467
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,520
Oh, hey. What's up?

468
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,400
Yeah, hi.

469
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,120
Nice to meet you.

470
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:58,800
Nice to meet you.

471
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,600
How are you doing?

472
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,520
Great.

473
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:01,280
Yeah.

474
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,120
How long have you been here?

475
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:08,400
I've been here about two
and a half months, maybe?

476
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,800
Do you know a person
named "Song Hangyu"?

477
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,240
Never heard about it.

478
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,320
What about you?

479
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:15,640
No, I'm sorry.

480
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:17,080
Okay.

481
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,120
Who are you guys talking about?

482
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,880
It's nothing.

483
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,800
Peter, I'm back.

484
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,840
Hey, man.

485
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,560
Hey, what's up?

486
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,800
No pain, no gain.

487
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,720
Hey, man.

488
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,160
You know, your Chinese friend
was looking for someone

489
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:47,240
since she started working here.

490
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,840
Do you know the person
she's looking for?

491
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:57,040
I think she's called "Song Guangyu".

492
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,920
"Song Guangyu"?

493
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,280
Yeah, I think so.

494
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:02,880
Okay, thank you.

495
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,400
Yeah, you're welcome.

496
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,120
"Song Guangyu".

497
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,920
Let me help you.

498
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,200
Why are you here?

499
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,600
Are you trying to bully me

500
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,840
while my sister's away?

501
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,400
What? I think you'll bully me instead.

502
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,400
Siqi.

503
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,880
Is Xia Yuan looking for someone

504
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,680
named "Song Guangyu"?

505
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,520
Who?

506
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,360
It's either "Song Guangyu"
or "Song Kuangyu".

507
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,400
The name starts with "Song"
and ends with "Yu".

508
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,360
Do you mean "Song Hangyu"?

509
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,280
That's right!
Why is she looking for him?

510
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,600
Didn't my sister tell you

511
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,640
why she came to Europe?

512
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,240
No.

513
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,120
Forget it.

514
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:00,440
You don't need to know anyway.

515
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,760
I just thought this person
was important to her,

516
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,280
seeing as how she's moping around,
I thought I'd ask you.

517
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,080
This person is important indeed.

518
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,080
My sister is unhappy every day

519
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,880
because of this scum!

520
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,680
Don't tell me this person is her...

521
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,680
What?

522
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,920
She was wearing a wedding dress

523
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,480
when I first met her.

524
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,960
That person didn't run away, did he?

525
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,960
I didn't say that!

526
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,520
I know nothing about that!

527
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,200
Why didn't Xia Yuan tell me about it?

528
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,640
You're lazing around
and daydreaming again.

529
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,280
Are you still staying over today?

530
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,720
No, not today. It's the weekend.

531
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,440
Peter and his girlfriend are out,

532
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:59,320
so I have the entire room to myself.

533
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:00,520
Well, congratulations

534
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,600
for finally having your own space.

535
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,040
What's going on?
Why are you here to see me?

536
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,880
Oh, right. This is the insect repellent
my dad gave me

537
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,360
before I left the country.

538
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,120
Spray it on the side of your bed
when you go to sleep,

539
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,600
and there will be no spiders.

540
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,600
Are you giving it to me?

541
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,880
Of course, you coward. Take it.

542
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:19,080
Thanks. You're a real lifesaver.

543
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,880
All right then.
I'll leave you to your rest.

544
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,680
I'll leave you in peace. See you.

545
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,760
Xia Yuan.

546
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,640
You came to Europe...

547
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,040
Forget it. Just go.

548
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,040
Whatever.

549
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,600
Hello? Bro,

550
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:00,040
help me find a person.

551
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,040
Morning.

552
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,040
Morning.

553
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,680
I woke up hungry
and came here to get some food.

554
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,360
What is this?

555
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,480
It's for my sister.

556
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,520
Is that so?
What are you guys up to today?

557
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,520
She'll go and look
for Song Hangyu today,

558
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,160
so I'll go with her.

559
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,440
I want to join too.

560
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,680
Come on, get in.

561
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:42,160
I borrowed this car from Kate.

562
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,480
I'll drive you guys.

563
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:49,080
Yuan, I'm sorry. It was me who told him.

564
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,240
It's not her fault.

565
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,680
I made her tell me.

566
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,040
You guys don't have to apologize.
Let's go. Get in the car.

Hello. Excuse me, sir.

572
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,040
Hello.

573
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:36,040
Sorry to disturb you.

574
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:36,960
Do you know a person

575
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:37,920
named "Song Hangyu"?

576
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,560
Nah, I don't know.

577
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:40,920
No?

578
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,960
You've never heard of him?

579
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:44,480
No.

580
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,920
Okay, thank you.

581
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,400
Let's keep asking around.

582
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,720
Let's go, Yuan.

583
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,040
Thank you.

Sorry to disturb you.

587
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,040
Do you know a person

588
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:05,880
named "Song Hangyu"?

589
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,720
Don't know.

590
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,960
Let's ask someone else.

591
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,280
Thank you.

592
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,920
Yuan, can't you find

593
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,400
even one photo of him?

594
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,040
To be honest, we Chinese

595
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,160
all look the same to foreigners.

596
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,080
If you don't show them a photo,

597
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:32,040
it'll be hard for them
to actually recall it.

598
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,680
Anyway, this area isn't that big.

599
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,200
We've been looking

600
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,400
for this one person for so long.

601
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,760
Why haven't we heard anything?

602
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,280
We're looking for a needle
in a haystack.

603
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,840
Do you think it'd be easy to do so?

604
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,960
Let's take our time to look.

605
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:02,280
Yuan, you have to be mentally prepared
for the fact

606
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,440
that situations like today's are likely

607
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,200
to be the norm from now on.

608
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,160
Xia Yuan.

609
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:10,280
Don't worry too much.
I'm sure we'll find him.

610
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:12,840
I know.

611
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:18,840
Come on, let's head back.

612
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,200
Who was it that said
he had no problems again?

613
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,760
I think you have a big problem.

614
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,400
I'll do it. Go clean the vegetables.

615
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:16,120
You should just sit tight on the side,

616
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,440
and give Yuan and I a round of applause

617
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,560
when we're done cooking, got it?

618
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,160
I'm not a fool though.

619
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,880
Don't stand here if you don't know
how to cook. You're taking up space.

620
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,520
It's okay. If you want to be here,

621
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,040
you can try it out later on.

622
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,560
Hao Weilai!

623
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:54,920
What's wrong? Here, let me do it!

624
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,400
Go away!

625
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,440
Help around, will you?

626
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,960
Take care of the eggs.

627
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,520
I'm done with the eggs.

628
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,760
Why did you tell me to come here then?
You've disturbed my nap.

629
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:08,880
You promised to cook

630
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,760
on our way back, no?

631
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,000
Well, did you let me do it?

632
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,680
What are you so angry for?

633
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,120
Yuan, how about we put one yuan
in one of them?

634
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,120
My grandma used to do this all the time.

635
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:39,440
She said whoever eats it

636
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,040
will be lucky for a whole year.

637
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:41,760
Sure.

638
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,800
We used to do it at home too.

639
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,400
Money is so unhygienic.

640
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:46,680
My family said

641
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,720
money is the filthiest thing
in the world.

642
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,120
10,000 hands have touched it.

643
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,280
How about this then?

644
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,400
Let's use a piece of apple instead.
We have a lot of apples here.

645
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,520
Sure! I'll go get one.

646
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,280
I said you didn't know how to do it,
but you insisted on it.

647
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,960
What a waste of food!

648
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,320
It's just a bowl of wontons.
Are you kidding me?

649
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,080
These are clearly dumplings, okay?

650
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,560
Do you know what these dumplings mean?

651
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,680
They mean my heart is bleeding,

652
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,440
and I'm going to lose her very soon!

653
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,200
Anyway, I'm here to resign.

654
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,480
My passport will be done soon,
and I'll leave

655
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,320
as soon as I get my visa.
I, Qiao Bin, will tell her

656
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:50,000
that no one can steal my woman
away from me!

657
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,360
- It's decided then. Bye!
- Hold on!

658
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:55,040
Before we eat,
I'd like to say a few words.

659
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,760
This is the first time in my life

660
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,040
that I've tried cooking.

661
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,240
Although I didn't help much,

662
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:02,160
I still think

663
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:04,440
it was a very valuable experience.

664
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,240
You're all talk and no action.

665
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,720
Get up and distribute the dumplings.

666
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,760
You finally allowed me to do something.

667
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,640
I'll take a picture
and send it to my parents.

668
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,720
When my mom was alive,

669
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,920
she used to make me dumplings
all the time as well.

670
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,920
Mom.

671
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,480
I miss you so much.

672
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,960
Let's eat. It's tasty.

673
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:14,960
Let's see who gets that lucky dumpling.

674
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,560
Look!

675
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,120
Yuan, you're so amazing!

676
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,680
You got it right away!

677
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:43,280
Congratulations to Xia Yuan for gaining
her good fortune and prosperity!

678
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:47,440
Yuan, since you ate
this dumpling with apple,

679
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,080
you'll be lucky for a whole year.

680
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:51,640
You'll do well in Europe for sure.

681
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:53,160
Thank you.

682
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,360
Give me your hands, you two.

683
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,240
I'm sharing

684
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,440
my good luck with you guys now,

685
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:06,560
so you'll have even better luck.

686
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,800
Yuan, you're so nice.

687
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,000
That violated my scientific boundaries.

688
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,840
Let's send Kate some dumplings too!

689
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:29,000
Will she appreciate it though?

690
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,320
That's up to her,

691
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:33,040
and it's up to us to send it or not.

692
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:37,520
Let's dig in.

693
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:40,720
She's right there.

694
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,040
Kate.

695
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,720
Have you had dinner?

696
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,880
We made some traditional Chinese food.

697
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,360
They're called "dumplings".
Have you heard of them?

698
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:52,800
Here you go.

699
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,320
No.

700
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,920
Please try some.

701
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,600
We spent a long time making them.

702
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,840
They're not bad.

703
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,480
I don't need you to treat me like this!

704
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,800
I don't want your food!

705
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,120
Leave now. I'm trying to get some rest.

706
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,320
What's wrong with her?

707
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,480
Why does she always have it in for me?

708
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,800
I have to get to the bottom of this.

709
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,280
Let's go back first.

710
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,800
Come on.

711
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:51,840
So, this is your wedding photo?

712
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:58,360
Yuan, now that you've found the photo,

713
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,480
let's go and ask Kate tomorrow.

714
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,320
Forget about it.

715
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:05,080
Kate has never been very nice to you.

716
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,800
Let me go and ask her instead.

717
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:11,560
Siqi, this is my own business.

718
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,120
I should ask her myself.

719
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,120
Kate, I'm glad you're here!

720
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,120
I found the photo.

721
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,960
It's this person.
He's called "Song Hangyu".

722
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:36,600
Previously, have you...

723
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,320
