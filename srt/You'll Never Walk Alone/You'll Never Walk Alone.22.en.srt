119
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,640
I'll accept this fact
even if she doesn't come back.

00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,920
I had no idea

125
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,840

127
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,680

129
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,960
You've been nothing to Xia Yuan
since forever.

130
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,640
So why are you still clinging to her?

131
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,000
Are you even in the position
to criticize me?

132
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:50,880
I just want to see her

133
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,680
to explain my feelings for her.

134
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,000
How am I not in a position
to criticize you?

135
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,240
I ended up like here because of you.

136
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,880
I am willing to die for Xia Yuan.

137
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,200
But because Xia Yuan wanted to save you,

138
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,400
and I ended here

139
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,720
because I'm also indirectly saving you.

140
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,600
Not only am I
in a position to criticize you.

141
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,840
I'm also in a position to beat you.

142
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,640
Then tell me, what can I do?

143
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,240
What can I do?

144
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,520

147
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,480
I have no rights at all.

148

149
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,520

the both of you implicated.

154
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,040

155
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,120
Shut it. Hear me?

156
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,920

159
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,640
Did I owe anyone money?

Oh, right.

He's my guest at he moment.

183
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,200
Okay.
Let's stop beating around the bush.

184
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,800
We could have called the cops.

185
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,160
But we would like
to first understand the situation.

186
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:23,680
We're not here to cause trouble.

187
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,600
We're here to solve the problem.

188
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,000
Bring them in.

Hao Weilai.

190
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,280
Xia Yuan.

191
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,200
Are you alright?

192
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,400
- I'm fine.
- Are you alright?

193
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,080
Are you injured?

194
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,800
Mischief Man?

195
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,120
Why are you here.

196
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,840
I was too worried.

197
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,000
I was helpless.

198
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,880
So I went to Mr. Xu for help.

199
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,520
Since you have all met,

200
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,920
let's talk about business now.

201
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,720
So far,

202
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,200
Mr. Song still owes me money.

203
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,800
We are not friends with this person
with the surname Song.

204
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,600
We've come for Hao Weilai.

205
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,400
Okay, but

206
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,640
Mr. Hao is a friend of this lady.

207
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,120
He has promised to pay off Song's debt.

208
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,160
I don't know

209
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,320
what's going on between you guys,

210
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,760
to be honest, I don't care either.

211
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:25,560
I just want my money.

212
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,640
So I'm very sorry, Mr. Xu.

213
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:30,520
And if you have any solutions,

214
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:32,440
I'm all ears.

215
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,160
I won't repay the debt
for this person with the surname Song.

216
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,200
But I can guarantee

217
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,720
that he'll repay you in installments.

218
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,240
Thank you.

219
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,000
I will pay on time.

220
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,480
A guarantor? Okay, that works.

221
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,520
I agree to your solution.

222
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,120
You'll be the guarantor.

223
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,960
As long as he pays me on time,

224
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,760
that way,

225
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,800
so,

226
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,560
I won't have any reasons
to keep you with me.

227
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,800
You're free to go.

228
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,280
Okay. Let's go.

229
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,440
Let's go.

230
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,040
Are you alright?

231
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,560
Mischief Boy, listen to me.

232
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,280
All of you are to go back
to the winery with me today.

233
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,040
I've missed you all.

234
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,320
Dad, it's been a tough day for them.

235
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,200
Let them rest and
we'll see them in a few days.

236
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,800
Hui is the most thoughtful.

237
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,840
Let me take you back.

238
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,320
Let's go.

239
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,280
Okay. Let's go.

240
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,560
Yuan.

241
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,720
Xia Yuan.

242
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,040
Get in the car first,
I'll be there soon.

243
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,920
Okay.

244
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,840
Go on.

245
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,320
Let's go ahead.

246
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,760
Thank you.

247
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,240
You don't need to thank me.

248
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,200
From now on,
neither do we owe each other anything

249
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,200
nor will we see each other again.

250
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,400
Take care.

I've been wanting to come

263
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,080
but Yuan kept refusing.

264
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,760
So? Not bad, huh?

265
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,120
Does it look like a home?

266
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,960
There's something I need to say.

267
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:25,160
- Take good care of Xia Yuan.
- Take good care of Xia Yuan.

268
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,400
Got it.

269
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,280
Hui, here.

270
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,640
- Yuan.
- Have some fruits.

271
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,240
Thank you and your dad.

272
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,480
Please help me thank Mr. Xu
when you're back.

273
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,240
He must be exhausted.

274
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,400
You are really like our family.

275
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,240
You always help us

276
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,160
when we encounter difficulties.

277
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,120
Today,

278
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,320
I was scared in the beginning.

279
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,000
It wasn't until Uncle Quan
and Uncle Scar appeared

280
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,960
that I felt so touched, you know?

281
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,240
Okay.

282
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,680
You've thanked me enough.

283
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,320
I'm blessed to have met you guys.

284
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,520
Do go back when you have time.

285
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,240
My dad misses you guys a lot.

286
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:09,840
By the way,

287
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:12,520
how's the new staff recruitment
in your restaurant going?

288
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:14,320
Uncle Quan recruited a few staff.

289
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,680
They're pretty good.

290
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,400
This matter has been tough on you guys.

291
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:19,120
Rest well.

292
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,640
It feels like the weight
upon my shoulders

293
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,120
have finally been lifted off.

294
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,760
I'm at ease.

295
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,720
I think you're at ease

296
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,280
because I'm with you.

297
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,800
Xia Yuan, I promise you

298
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,440
that no matter what happens
in the future,

299
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,040
I will be by your side.

300
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,640
You'll never be alone.

301
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,880
You've said it.

302
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:57,880
No matter what it is,

303
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,160
no matter what difficulties,

304
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,360
you have to tell me

305
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,480
and stand by me.

306
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,640
Okay.

307
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,840
Your ride's here. Get on.

308
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,080
Where's the car?

309
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,480
I am your ride.

310
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,360
Here.

311
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,200
Hey.

312
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,280
Off we go.

313
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,720
Anyway,

314
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,000
he is a very responsible man.

315
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,440
Xia Yuan, I don't mean
to rain on your parade.

316
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,440
But how could a ladies' man

317
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:32,320
turn into

318
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,000
a good man when he's with you?

319
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,720
The transformation is a little
too fast to be true.

320
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,520
That's because you
don't know him enough.

321
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,360
When you have known him
for quite some time,

322
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,760
you will find

323
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,880
that when you encounter troubles,

324
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,920
he is responsible

325
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,280
and capable of being trusted.

326
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,080
Sometimes,

327
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:52,040
the way he looks at me

328
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,280
is so adorable.

329
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,480
He looks silly,

330
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,040
like a little boy.

331
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:58,760
Xia Yuan, this is the first time
I've noticed

332
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,920
you're brimming with admiration.

333
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,560
Although I

334
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,640
have been bickering with Hao Weilai,

335
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,360
this time, I can tell

336
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,920
that you are very blissful.

337
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,240
That puts me at ease.

338
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,240
Xia Yuan, did he take the initiative
to confess his feelings for you?

339
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,720
I think so.

340
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,560
Okay. He's not too disappointing.

341
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:28,520
Xia Yuan, I have a question to ask.

342
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,000
Go ahead.

343
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:34,000
Well, it's the norm for men
to confess their feelings to women.

344
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,400
But what if a woman

345
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,280
wishes to confess her feelings to a man?

346
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,200
How should she do it?

347
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,600
Don't look at me like that.

348
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,440
It seems like this little girl

349
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,240
is having some thoughts.

350
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,120
Yeah. I fell in love with Mr. Wei.

351
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,480
Actually, when I texted you that day,

352
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,960
I was already clear about my feelings
toward him.

353
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,640
But recently, I realized

354
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,480
that when facing him,

355
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,680
I don't even know how to express myself.

356
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,360
It's simple.

357
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,880
Since you truly like him,

358
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,600
you should strive for a relationship,

359
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,520
otherwise you will regret it.

360
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,960
Let me tell you,

361
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,000
there is no such thing

362
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
as "save face" in love.

363
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,800
Taking the initiative
to confess your feelings

364
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,280
doesn't make you the inferior one.

365
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,720
In a relationship,

366
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,880
both parties should be equal.

367
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,880
I understand

368
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,080
what you said,

369
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,000
but

370
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,520
I still don't know how to express it.

371
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,560
Let me tell you.

372
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,680
Love

373
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,080
is a wonderful thing.

374
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,200
It's useless no matter

375
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,040
how much you think

376
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,160
or guess.

377
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,240
When the timing truly comes,

378
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,400
you'll know it.

379
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:51,800
No matter what,

380
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:52,880
you have made your decision.

381
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,880
You have my support.

382
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,720
Dad. Mum.

383
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,720
Yuan, why didn't you tell me

384
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,120
that you're in a relationship?

385
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,200
This caught me off guard.

386
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,080
You shouldn't be talking like that.

387
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,120
Yuan, I'm ecstatic

388
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,520
that you started a new relationship.

389
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,760
I'm giving you my blessings.

390
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,080
But

391
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:37,360
there are many aspects
you might need to pay attention to.

392
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,080
You're currently abroad.

393
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:39,960
After all,

394
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,160
the cultural background of foreigners

395
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,760
is different from
that of us Chinese people.

396
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,760
So is it challenging for you

397
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,560
being in a relationship
with a foreigner?

398
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,440
Yeah.

399
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,960
I won't be able

400
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,400
to learn up English fast enough.

401
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,120
You don't need to learn English.
He's not a foreigner,

402
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,480
he's Chinese.

403
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:58,000
He's Chinese?

404
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,360
This is just awesome.

405
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,440
Is he

406
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,240
on workcation like you?

407
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,480
How old is he?

408
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,680
What does he work as in China?

409
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,200
Stop asking so much.

410
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,600
What matters is Yuan likes him.

411
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,080
Yuan, is he a good kid?

412
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,240
Show me a photo of him.

413
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:16,960
Yes.

414
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,960
Yeah. Here he is.

415
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,640
You little brat.

416
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:23,880
So? Do you like him?

417
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,040
Say hello to my parents.

418
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,320
You're acting so secretive.
Where are you taking me?

419
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,760
Keep your eyes closed.

420
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,680
Okay.

421
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,040
Keep your eyes closed.

422
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,440
Okay.

423
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,080
We're almost there.

424
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,080
I won't fall, right?

425
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,040
No. Just trust me.

426
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,200
Okay. Open your eyes.

427
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,840
How did you get this RV?

428
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,120
What are we going to do with it?

429
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,480
Well,

430
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,160
so many unhappy things

431
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,000
had been happening
in our time in Europe.

432
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,720
We were stressed out.

433
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,920
I just want to give you a gift

434
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,040
to go enjoy

435
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,320
and relax.

436
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,320
Traveling with an RV. Good, huh?

437
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,560
Are we leaving right now?

438
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,000
A spontaneous trip?

439
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Yeah, a spontaneous trip

440
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,720
makes a trip all the more authentic.

441
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:25,160
I didn't bring any luggage with me.

442
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:27,320
I have already packed
your luggage for you.

443
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,560
They're in the RV.

444
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,680
Impressive.

445
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:41,040
What about work over
at Hui's restaurant?

446
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:44,160
I talked to Hui about it.

447
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:46,200
He supports me.

448
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,640
Okay. Let's go.

449
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,720
Where's the driver?

450
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:50,760
The driver?

451
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,320
You're the driver.

452
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:54,880
I am?

453
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,920
Yeah.

454
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:59,280
You just want me to drive

455
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,560
and take you on a trip, right?

456
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,880
No.

457
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,040
This is a sincere gift from me to you.

458
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,680
Okay. Let's go.

459
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,120
Are we leaving now?

460
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,000
Let's go.

461
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,600
We're going on a spontaneous trip.

462
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,400
Get to the driver's seat.

463
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,280
Okay.

464
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,520
Cream,

465
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,760
flour,

466
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,280
castor sugar,

467
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:37,400
butter,

468
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,720
eggs,

469
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,040
cocoa powder,

470
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,560
milk.

471
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,280
I've got all the ingredients.

472
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:47,240
Let's get started.

473
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,360
What? Did you get into trouble again?

474
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,840
No, no.

475
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,200
It's okay. I'll clean up for you.

476
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,520
No need.

477
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,160
You're the boss.

478
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,320
I can't trouble you always, can I?

479
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,080
Didn't you say you wanted to read?

480
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,600
Go, go.

481
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,520
Is there really nothing wrong?

482
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:11,840
Yeah.

483
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,280
You sure?

484
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,560
Go on.

485
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:35,080
Are you tired?

486
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:36,240
I'll take over.

487
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,080
It's okay. Just enjoy the view.

488
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,040
Where are we heading to?

489
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,200
I heard there is

490
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,680
a beautiful forest nearby.

491
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,880
Let's go take a look.

492
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:51,960
Okay.

493
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,600
Why is this forest so big?

494
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,160
Xia Yuan,

495
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,480
I think we're running out of gas.

496
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,040
Can you find us a nearby gas station?

497
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,680
Let's get some gas.

498
00:24:47,680 --> 00:24:48,400
Okay.

499
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,560
There's no signal here.

500
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,360
What?

501
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,160
How could it be?

502
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,400
Where is the exit?

503
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:25,880
Be careful.

504
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,600
What are you up to this time?

505
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,560
You'll find out in a second.

506
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,560
Be careful.

507
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,120
There are steps ahead.

508
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,720
There's a chair here.

509
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:54,280
You can take off the blindfold now.

510
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,560
Yeah?

511
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:16,000
[Happy Birthday]

512
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,440
Happy Birthday, Sir.

513
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,760
May you become more youthful

514
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,880
and happier,

515
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,480
and stay as young as you are.

516
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,480
Let's put the birthday hat on you.

517
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,600
How did you know it was my birthday?

518
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,200
When I was tidying up the study,

519
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,640
I accidentally saw your ID card.

520
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:43,040
Make a wish, Sir.

521
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,840
We're out of gas.

522
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:08,440
Let's get out and take a look.

523
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,840
Anybody here?

524
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,560
So? Is there signal here?

525
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,560
None.

526
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,160
What do we do?

527
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,320
Let's wait.

528
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,360
Here.

529
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,360
Siqi,

530
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:55,880
you know,

531
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,920
it's been

532
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,720
such a long time
since I last celebrated my birthday.

533
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,680
You don't like celebrating birthdays?

534
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:05,920
That's not it.

535
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,480
Perhaps,

536
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,760
when a person is at a certain age,

537
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,680
birthday celebrations
become less of a priority.

538
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,080
Unlike you youngsters,

539
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,000
gathering with a group of friends

540
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,720
over a meal and karaoke,

541
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,280
and imagining the future.

542
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,440
How wonderful.

543
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,840
Am I not pitiful?

544
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,000
No.

545
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:30,080
Sir,

546
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,720
I will spend every birthday with you

547
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,040
in the future.

548
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,440
Dig in.

549
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,240
So? How does it taste?

550
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,160
I used low fat milk

551
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,800
with no sugar added.

552
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,760
It's delicious.

553
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:02,560
Siqi, thank you.

554
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,880
You're welcome.

555
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:15,920
In fact, I haven't thanked you properly.

556
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,000
Instead, I've been
picking on your faults.

557
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,080
When I hired you as my assistant,

558
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,680
I did it

559
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,920
just to repay you for saving my life.

560
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,880
I placed no hope on you at all,

561
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,000
but

562
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,280
you always surprised me.

563
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,520
You were like

564
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,120
the invincible
Wreck-It Ralph in my life,

565
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,920
breaking down
every inherent thing in me.

566
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:48,280
However, I'm immensely grateful
that you came along

567
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,760
because you helped me experience

568
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,080
a different kind of happiness.

569
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,400
By the way,

570
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,680
there's one thing
I haven't told you yet.

571
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,400
You do a good job cleaning the rooms.

572
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:07,360
You don't have to tell me this.

573
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,040
Just secretly give me a salary raise.

574
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,760
You have been making
quick improvement lately,

575
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,560
and I am indeed planning
to give you a salary increase.

576
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,640
But I have to ask you,

577
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,760
isn't it boring

578
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,200
to be with me?

579
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,680
No. I really enjoy being with you.

580
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,560
Sir,

581
00:30:52,560 --> 00:30:54,680
I don't know why,

582
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,640
but when I'm with you,

583
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,960
I tend to be stubborn.

584
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,600
When I'm with you,

585
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,040
I can be myself without holding back.

586
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,440
You are willing to accept my hobbies,

587
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,960
tolerate my stubbornness,

588
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,680
and even willing to do

589
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:17,360
things that I want to do.

590
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,280
During this period,
I have done many things

591
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:22,720
that I only dare dream of.

592
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,120
When I'm with you,

593
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,360
I am both my old self

594
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,200
and my brand-new self.

595
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:33,080
I never imagined

596
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,720
meeting someone like you,

597
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,240
which makes my heart race

598
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,920
and scared at the same time.

599
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,120
Sir,

600
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,120
I think I'm in love with you.

601
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,840
I'm sure about it.

602
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:09,320
Sir, I'm in love with you.

603
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,480
Never mind.

604
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,600
Happy birthday.

605
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,040
We've been waiting for so long,

606
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,120
and neither a soul

607
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,640
nor a car has passed by.

608
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,440
How about we get help out there?

609
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,160
It's getting late. It's not safe.

610
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,160
Why don't we rest early

611
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,600
and get help out there tomorrow?

612
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,680
That works too.

613
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,120
Xia Yuan,

614
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,880
are you afraid?

615
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,320
I'm fine.

616
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,760
I'm not afraid.

617
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,880
I'm quite afraid.

618
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,080
It's my first time
spending the night in the wilderness.

619
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,200
But

620
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,880
I'm not afraid with you by my side.

621
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,440
Why?

622
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,400
You should be even more afraid

623
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,000
with me around.

624
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,000
Why?

625
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,840
- What sound is that?
- What is it?

626
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,560
Let's get into the RV.

627
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,160
- It's safer in the RV.
- What sound was that?

628
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,120
- Get in.
- What sound was that?

629
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,440
What animal was that?

630
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,040
Ye Siqi, it's your fault.

631
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,160
You messed everything up.

632
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,520
What if Sir won't talk to me

633
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,960
ever again?

634
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,560
Go to sleep if you're tired.

635
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,400
(I hope we'll find the way out tomorrow)

636
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:24,320
(Xia Yuan, I'll surely protect you.)

637
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:59,000
[KoalaKiki. I'm sorry. I was...]

638
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:04,620
[Sir, I'm sorry. Was I too...]

639
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:23,910
[I will be doing the most bravest thing.
KoalaKiki, you can do it. Go, go!]

640
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:26,720
When I'm with you,

641
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,800
I am both my old self

642
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,880
and my brand-new self.

643
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:34,960
Sir, I'm in love with you.

644
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:08,280
The sun is finally out.

645
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,640
What do we do now?

646
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:13,240
Let's get help.

647
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,360
Let's see if there's anyone

648
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,120
or any gas station.

649
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,880
Which way do we go?

650
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:21,840
That way.

651
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,080
Let's go.

652
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,160
Siqi.

653
00:38:58,760 --> 00:38:59,880
Siqi.

654
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:05,160
(Siqi,)

655
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,400
(where are you?)

656
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,960
(Where are you?)

657
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:24,720
No signal yet?

658
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:27,280
Nope. I'll try again.

659
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,920
Be careful.

660
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,680
Let head in that direction.

661
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:36,480
- Anyone there?
- None.

662
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:39,520
By the way,
is there a small town nearby?

663
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,760
I'm not sure.

664
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,760
Let me make a mark here
to avoid getting lost.

665
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,960
Let's go that way.

666
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,720
Let's go forward.

667
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,320
Let's see if there's a town.

668
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,320
Anybody here?

669
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,960
Bai, do you think I'll succeed?

670
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,480
I should be, right? Huh?

671
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:50,520
Bai, I've never felt so nervous.

672
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,040
But I've decided.

673
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,160
So I shall step out in courage.

674
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:57,040
Right?

675
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,480
