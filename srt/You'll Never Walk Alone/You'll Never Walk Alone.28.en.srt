Currently, gyms in China

148
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,480
have reached market saturation

149
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,160
and the elimination rate is very high.

150
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,480

157
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,920
The result of divergence is,

158

Okay.

170
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,400
My idea

171
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,080
is different
from other travel companies.

172
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,440
What I focus on is the concept
of small but refined.

173
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,840
I believe that the essence
of customized travel

174
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,600
lies in personalized service.

175
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,480
It should be fine-tuned
in a timely manner

176
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,040
according to customers' needs.

177
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,360
I believe that in terms of promotion,

178
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,760
we should guide customers

179
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,800
to accept the significance
of customized travel,

180
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,360
greatly minimize their worries.

181
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,560
Customized travel

182
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,480
is not a constraint,

183
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,920
but a form of freedom.

184
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,320
I have been in the tourism industry
for almost a decade.

185
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:19,040
In addition to the tourism resources
of various countries,

186
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,080
I have extensive experience

187
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,880
in customized travel.

188
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,840
Xia Yuan,

189
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,400
that's a good idea.

190
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,240
But there is still room

191
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,880
for improvement in your plan.

192
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,160
What are your thoughts?

193
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,720
I think

194
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,440
you should optimize

195
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,520
your highlights.

196
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,440
You can post

197
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,200
some of your posts

198
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,280
with over 100,000 views

199
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,120
because you are currently a one-man show

200
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,160
and have not formed a complete team.

201
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,080
I'm afraid the judges
will have reservations

202
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:49,240
if you don't showcase your abilities.

203
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,320
Mr. Wei,

204
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,840
I got it.

205
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,160
I am very optimistic
about your entrepreneurial project.

206
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,480
You must participate.

207
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,640
I'll be sure to.

208
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,800
Xia Yuan,

209
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,880
I've been looking through
quite a few proposals.

210
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,760
I think

211
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,600
you have the potential
to win first place.

212
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,240
It's possible.

213
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,760
I was so convinced to spend

214
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,480
after reading your proposal.

215
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,160
Sir,

216
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,680
we should get Xia Yuan

217
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,200
to plan our trips for us.

218
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:12,800
Sounds great.

219
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,440
Mr. Wei,

220
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,240
it's getting late.

221
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,760
I'll leave the proposal with you.

222
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,680
Let's talk about it again.

223
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,560
Sure.

224
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,080
I'll excuse myself.

225
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,320
Let me see you off, Xia Yuan.

226
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,200
Okay.

227
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,240
In here,

228
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:31,920
customers will be able to experience

229
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,640
personalized fitness services

230
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,120
without being bugged with sales.

231
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:35,880
In here,

232
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:36,920
customers can also

233
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,440
make some like-minded friends,

234
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,720
thus developing a friendship

235
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,480
formed through fitness.

236
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:42,560
More importantly,

237
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,600
in here,

238
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,920
customers don't have to worry
about tightening the belt,

239
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,760
and they can change the package

240
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,200
according to their financial situation.

241
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:48,840
This

242
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,640
is the selling point of Gymbox.

243
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,680
Gymbox,

244
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,360
your 24-hour

245
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,040
fitness companion.

246
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:56,560
I'm done.

247
00:09:58,400 --> 00:09:59,400
Bin,

248
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,360
now I know

249
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,680
why you are the golden fitness coach.

250
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,280
You're so convincing.

251
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,160
Monkey,

252
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,600
did it make you

253
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,520
want to come work out at my gymbox

254
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,280
after hearing my presentation?

255
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,160
Yeah.

256
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,280
It's convenient and cheap.

257
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,920
I would love to go there now.

258
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:17,800
Weilai,

259
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,800
what do you think?

260
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,160
This is done

261
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,280
based on
the divergent thinking you taught me.

262
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,760
I think

263
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,560
it's not bad.

264
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,680
Sofia and I thought this up.

265
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,760
I would like to launch
a set of applications

266
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:40,800
that match this project

267
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,720
once it is implemented.

268
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,520
This is in your old line of expertise.

269
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,520
You remember that, right?

270
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,480
Yeah.

271
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,520
If you need any help,

272
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:49,600
just let me know.

273
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,480
Actually, I want to participate

274
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:53,960
in the entrepreneurship competition.

275
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,000
No matter what the outcome is,

276
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,720
I must make Gymbox a success.

277
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,280
Bin,

278
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,440
this project requires a lot of funding

279
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,600
in the early stages, right?

280
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,080
That's why

281
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,520
I'm looking for investors.

282
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:09,760
Why are you looking at me?

283
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,600
I don't have money.

284
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,520
I have gotten myself an investor.

285
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:17,520
You know the person.

286
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,040
Who is it?

287
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,240
It

288
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,320
is the loyal customer

289
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,600
at my gym.

290
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,240
Is the person reliable?

291
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,160
Lisa, over here.

292
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,680
I read

293
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,320
your proposal.

294
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,240
I made some annotations

295
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,720
in parts which I think
are not yet perfect

296
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,880
because you have been emphasizing

297
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,160
on how strategic the location is

298
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,920
and how affordable it is.

299
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,440
But have you ever thought about

300
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,840
how to help first-time users of Gymbox

301
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,320
understand

302
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,600
the methods and approaches?

303
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,000
Actually,

304
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,640
I have already thought about this.

305
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,440
We will provide

306
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,600
a professional fitness coach

307
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,360
for all of our first-time
Gymbox customers

308
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,120
to carry out
some teaching and analyzing.

309
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,160
Then, they may need to go to the gym

310
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,360
to get their data recorded,

311
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,320
upload it to the supporting application,

312
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,880
and finally generate
a virtual fitness coach

313
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,000
to plan for all their
future fitness activities.

314
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,480
There's even a virtual fitness coach?

315
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,520
In that case,

316
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,560
I have a suggestion for you.

317
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,920
It is important to have real coaches

318
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:47,880
regularly check
the fitness results of students.

319
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,400
This way, the use

320
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,560
of both virtual and real coaches

321
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,800
can also attract more young people.

322
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,000
Why did I not think of this?

323
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,360
This works.

324
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:55,800
It's really good.

325
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,840
But

326
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,840
this is a great expense.

327
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,000
Are you sure about it?

328
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:06,680
In that case,

329
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,680
you need to

330
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,760
write it down

331
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,240
in detail.

332
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,280
Bin,

333
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,560
you're no longer
my personal fitness coach.

334
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,600
I see you as my business partner,

335
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,120
so my requirements
will also be stricter.

336
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,600
I will get a professional

337
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:24,520
to evaluate your proposal.

338
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:26,040
However,
if it does not meet the standards,

339
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,640
I may withdraw
the investment at any time.

340
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,680
However, I still hope
we can achieve a win-win situation,

341
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,280
okay?

342
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:30,960
Okay.

343
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,760
- I look forward to working with you.
- Likewise.

344
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,560
But Bin,

345
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,840
before your gymbox takes off,

346
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,280
you still need have to train me.

347
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,920
Sure. Your wish is my command.

348
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,720
[No fear of others. Think for your sake]
Okay.

349
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,440
- I'm getting change.
- Go.

350
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,080
Here.

351
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,440
It's here.

352
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,320
Welcome.

353
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,720
Wait for me.

354
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:37,000
♪Happy birthday to you♪

355
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,080
♪Happy birthday to you♪

356
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:46,680

♪Happy birthday to you♪

358
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,640
Happy birthday.

359
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:12,640
Come.

360
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,040
Make a wish.

361
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,960
Blow out the candles.

362
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,920
Sir,

363
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:55,960
so

364
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:59,080
this is the "investor"
whom you were planning to meet?

365
00:15:59,080 --> 00:15:59,840
Yeah.

366
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,360
So?

367
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:04,480
Are you pleased?

368
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,240
Yes.

369
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:08,960
I'm pleased

370
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,600
and moved.

371
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,080
Thank you

372
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,400
for always giving me surprises.

373
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,160
You don't need to thank me.

374
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,160
You deserve

375
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,680
all of this.

376
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,400
Sir,

377
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,880
how did you know it was my birthday?

378
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,280
Did you

379
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:29,400
secretly look at my ID card too?

380
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,760
Actually, Sir,

381
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,040
today

382
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,760
isn't my birthday.

383
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,440
It isn't?

384
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,760
Mum,

385
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,120
it's my birthday today.

386
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,440
Granny has been out since morning

387
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,680
and hasn't been back.

388
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:55,280
I'm hungry.

389
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,400
So I could only afford a bread.

390
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,960
It's round,

391
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,720
which looks like the cake

392
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,360
you bought me last time.

393
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,440
Mum,

394
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,080
when will you be back?

395
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:08,160
I miss you so much.

396
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:13,160
I wish that dad
is living happily in heaven.

397
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:16,520
And, I wish that Mum comes back quickly.

398
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,320
When I was very young,

399
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,720
my father passed away.

400
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,760
Not long after,

401
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,040
my mother left.

402
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:34,680
I was raised

403
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,760
by my grandmother.

404
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,160
My grandmother was very busy

405
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,800
and didn't have time to take care of me.

406
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,640
When registering my ID card,

407
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,360
she remembered the wrong birth date.

408
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:47,840
So that's how

409
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,080
this mistake was recorded till today.

410
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,000
Sir, you know,

411
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,560
when I was a little,

412
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:55,600
I envied other children

413
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,080
who had family with them

414
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:58,880
on their birthdays.

415
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,360
Siqi,

416
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,080
from now on

417
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,320
we're family.

418
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,400
I will

419
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,680
grow old with you.

420
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:35,040
Thank you,

421
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,360
my old man.

422
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,920
You're welcome, my old lady.

423
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,960
Mr. Hao.

424
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,480
Weilai,

425
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,480
the sum is out.

426
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,800
So?

427
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,120
Isn't the comparison very obvious?

428
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:14,040
Don't be too proud.

429
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,720
Your dad has also taken on a new order.

430
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,120
Mr. Ge, tell us already.

431
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,920
Mr. Hao's sales revenue

432
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:26,440
is less than one-third of Weilai's.

433
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,040
Based on the current situation,

434
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,320
we shall be able to repay out debts
if we will persist for another year.

435
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,240
Then our company

436
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,760
can get back on track.

437
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,680
Dad.

438
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,160
What?

439
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:43,720
Do you want

440
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,280
to let me handle
all the production lines?

441
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,520
This way we can
pay off the debt quicker.

442
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,320
No.

443
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,600
You have your desires

444
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,360
and I have my stands.

445
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,800
Are you afraid

446
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,920
that if you let me
handle all the production lines,

447
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,280
I will become the boss,

448
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,440
and you'll have to listen to me?

449
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,760
Even if I let you
handle all the production lines,

450
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,000
I'm still your boss.

451
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,560
But your products

452
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,880
target the elderly.

453
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,200
There's no market in that.

454
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,840
My products target young people.

455
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,600
The market for young people is huge,
you know?

456
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:19,280
Are you looking down on the elderly?

457
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,520
The elderly people
have strong buying power.

458
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:25,040
Where do you think
you young people's money come from?

459
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,160
From the elderly, right?

460
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,200
Since you're so determined,

461
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,200
let's have a competition.

462
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:34,680
What's the bet?

463
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,240
If I surpass your sales revenue

464
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,520
in the next three months,

465
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,400
you'll pass me all the production lines

466
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,560
and get into branding with me.

467
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,800
What if you lose?

468
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,760
If I lose,

469
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,640
then everything goes back to normal.

470
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,240
You punk. How dare you fool me?

471
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:55,440
You punk.

472
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,560
Oh. Hi, Dad.

473
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,920
I bet you're tired.

474
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,200
I'm fine.

475
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,280
Take a breather. Have some fruits.

476
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,800
Thanks, Dad.

477
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,440
Rest well.

478
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,640
Okay.

479
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,920
So?

we have interfered

483
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,040
too much?

00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:26,880

What Xia's dad said

519
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,160
doesn't represent what she said.

520
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,760
Just because of this, you backed down,

521
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,800
and then you hid your emotions.

522
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,040
That would make Xia even sadder.

Didn't Xia stick with you?

550
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,440

00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,920
I'll look through the proposal for you.

571
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,840
It looks like

572
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,120
you know what you're doing.

573
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,400
Watch how you speak.

574
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,440
I've spent many days

575
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,360
looking through many proposals.

576
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,480
So this won't

577
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,600
be a problem for me.

578
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:53,960
So?

579
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,240
Is my proposal okay?

580
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,040
Did you write this proposal yourself?

581
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,400
Yeap.

582
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,560
But a part of it

583
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,040
was arranged by Sofia,

584
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,320
and

585
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,000
my investor

586
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,160
has already

587
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,200
run it through evaluators.

588
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,200
The feedback is pretty good.

589
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,080
Qiao Bin,

590
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,960
I'm really impressed.

591
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,640
To be honest,

592
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,840
I didn't expect you to submit

593
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,640
a complete proposal.

594
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,880
Am I qualified

595
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,200
to participate
in the entrepreneurship competition?

596
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,400
It shouldn't be a problem.

597
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,160
Remember to upload
the information online later.

598
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:44,520
Please,

599
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,640
Uncle, Auntie,

600
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,320
have a seat.

601
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,160
Sit.

602
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,920
I invited you

603
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,760
today

604
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,000
to tell you

605
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,680
about my real situation.

606
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,240
This is where I'm staying temporarily.

607
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,920
Both my dad and I

608
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:04,440
live in the employee's dormitory.

609
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,160
If the situation gets better,

610
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:10,680
we may be able

611
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,320
to go back to how life was.

612
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,320
But if the situation is less than ideal,

613
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,360
we may not even
be able to afford to live here.

614
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,160
But is it that important

615
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,280
where I live?

616
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,160
When I lived abroad with Xia Yuan,

617
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:28,760
we experienced many things

618
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,920
and we were cash-strapped.

619
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,520
However, she never despised me.

620
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,000
I've always

621
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,840
remembered her kindness.

622
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:38,840
So since then,

623
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,760
I have made up my mind

624
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,400
to treat Xia Yuan well.

625
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,200
As long as I have water,

626
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:46,760
I will make soup for her.

627
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:48,520
As long as I have rice,

628
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,080
I will cook it for her.

629
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,880
This is my promise to Xia Yuan

630
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,520
and also my promise to you.

631
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,320
After all,

632
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,320
Yuan's our only daughter.

633
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,680
I also hope that my daughter

634
00:29:01,680 --> 00:29:04,000
can live a better life.

635
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:06,280
So I hope

636
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,880
you can understand this.

637
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,000
Auntie,

638
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,760
I understand what you're saying.

639
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,880
You may not have known

640
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,000
the financial background

641
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,960
I had two years ago.

642
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,600
I lived in the city center

643
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,640
I had a car, food, and clothing.

644
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,400
But now,

645
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,200
I live here.

646
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:26,480
This may be

647
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,760
a hurdle in the ups and downs of life.

648
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,120
No one knows what will happen

649
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:32,800
in two years.

650
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,600
But we will definitely
not live like this in the future.

651
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,000
Because one thing

652
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,360
I am clear about

653
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,600
is that I love Xia Yuan.

654
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:50,960
- There's something...
- There's something...

655
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,080
- Go ahead.
- Go ahead.

656
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,280
- Hao Weilai...
- Xia Yuan...

657
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,200
Actually, I think

658
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,360
Hao Weilai

659
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,190
still deeply loves Xia Yuan.

660
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,720
I think

661
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,200
Xia Yuan still loves Hao Weilai.

662
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,400
You must be Xia Yuan's parents.

663
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,360
Hello.

664
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,320
Dad, I...

665
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,520
Since it's our first time
meeting each other,

666
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,120
could you just listen to me?

667
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,360
Okay.

668
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,560
I often oppose

669
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,080
my son's ideas and actions.

670
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,920
But I have met Xia Yuan.

671
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,120
She is just outstanding.

672
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,760
She acts appropriately, she's polite,

673
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:33,840
and has ambition.

674
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,160
I really like her.

675
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,280
Most importantly is that, I see them

676
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:38,800
love each other deeply.

677
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,840
So this time, I have decided

678
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,400
to support my son.

679
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,880
As you can see,

680
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,320
our family has been
experiencing some issues recently.

681
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,640
But I believe,

682
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,000
working together with my son

683
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,320
will definitely turn things around.

684
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,080
Mr. and Mrs. Xia,

685
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,120
I guarantee

686
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,360
to treat Xia Yuan

687
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:59,040
as my own.

688
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,680
Actually, we are not

689
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,800
the unreasonable kind.

690
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,360
We are all parents.

691
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,640
You're thinking for your son's sake,

692
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,520
and I am thinking
for my daughter's sake.

693
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:12,960
Actually, none of us are to blame.

694
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,600
Allow me to say this.

695
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,360
Talk is easy

696
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,520
but what's important for us,

697
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,400
is action.

698
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,840
I got

699
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,560
what Weilai said just now.

700
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,760
We'll give it a think.

701
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,960
Okay.

702
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,880
Please excuse us.

703
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,560
Okay. Let me see you off.

704
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,120
I didn't know that Hao Weilai

705
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,400
has been through so much emotionally.

706
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,880
Yeah, he has been

707
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,000
feeling aggrieved lately.

708
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,800
He has been
shouldering everything on his own.

709
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,760
And,

710
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,800
he went to meet
Xia Yuan's parents today.

711
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,520
I don't know how the conversation went.

712
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,680
However, Hao Weilai has already decided

713
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:13,400
to get Xia Yuan back.

714
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,720
That's good news.

715
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,040
Although Xia Yuan doesn't say anything,

716
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,200
I understand her thoughts.

717
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,320
She has been in pain all this while.

718
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,520
I think she's been waiting
for Hao Weilai to do something.

719
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,560
I think we might

720
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:30,040
need to come up with a plan.

721
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:31,600
You invite Xia Yuan out.

722
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,520
No problem.

723
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,320
I'd do anything as long as

724
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,680
it helps them get back together.

725
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,520
Give me a high five.

726
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,000
How childish.

727
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,240
We could've

728
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,560
just have our meal anywhere.

729
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,280
Have a seat.

730
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,120
The ambiance here is nice, huh?

731
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:00,120
Not bad.

732
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,760
Sir brought me here

733
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,920
to celebrate my birthday the last time.

734
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,440
When did Mr. Xu

735
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,880
become this romantic?

736
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:10,160
He's always been romantic.

737
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,480
Here, Xia Yuan, go through the menu.

738
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,720
- Okay.
- Just order whatever you want.

739
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,160
My treat.

740
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,560
Xia Yuan, I'll use the restroom.

741
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,560
Okay.

742
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,840
What would you like?
Or, I'll just order for you, okay?

743
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,080
Okay.

744
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,200
Nervous?

745
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,320
How is Xia Yuan feeling today?

746
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,640
I think she's in a pretty good mood.

747
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,400
How do I look?

748
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,760
You look really handsome.

749
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,920
- Yeah?
- Don't be nervous, Hao Weilai.

750
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:49,760
I'm sure that Xia Yuan still loves you.

751
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,280
Just based on this alone,

752
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,440
I bet your attempt would be successful.

753
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,400
- We're rooting for you.
- We're rooting for you.

754
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,640
It'd be a success.

755
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,280
I'm off.

756
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,320
Be on your way.

757
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,160
Xia Yuan,

758
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,080
No matter what the reason was,

759
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,440
I shouldn't have neglected you.

760
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,320
You shouldn't be left
to bear things alone.

761
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,640
I was wrong.

762
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,960
Can you forgive me?

763
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,360
That depends

764
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,200
on your performance in the future.

765
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,760
Have a seat.

766
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,200
Why did you ignore me before this?

767
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,760
It's because

768
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,240
your dad came to see me.

769
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:54,000
My dad went to see you?

770
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,400
For what?

771
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,040
What did he say?

772
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:58,880
He

773
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,960
might be thinking

774
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,520
that I'm poor,

775
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,920
and that we're not suitable
for each other.

776
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,600
He might think I don't have money

777
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,600
and can't give you happiness.

778
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,400
Why didn't you tell me

779
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,520
that my dad went to see you?

780
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,560
I wanted to tell you,

781
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,840
but I don't know how to say it.

782
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,600
Okay.

783
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,000
So you'll just keep mum?

784
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:27,840
My dad asked you to break up with me,

785
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,240
so you just ignored me?

786
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,160
Then what are you here for today?

787
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:38,480
I met your parents again.

788
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,760
I talked to them.

789
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:42,280
I think they

790
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:44,200
wouldn't be stopping us
from seeing each other anymore.

791
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,480
But what if they do?

792
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:49,360
Are you going to ignore me again,

793
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,600
and break up with me as per their order,

794
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,280
or get back with me again
as per their order?

795
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,840
So you only listen
to my parents' orders?

796
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:55,320
I...

797
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,120
Then, what am I to you?

798
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,680
Hao Weilai,

799
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,360
what did I tell you before?

800
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,080
Did I not tell you

801
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,960
that no matter what happens

802
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:07,840
or what difficulties you encounter,

803
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:08,920
you have to tell me

804
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,480
and we will face them together.

805
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,960
But what did you do?

806
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:15,360
Did you tell me?

807
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,560
You said nothing

808
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,320
at all.

809
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,720
It's like Song Hangyu all over again.

810
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,240
The relationship between two people

811
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,200
can't be decided by just one party.

812
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:39,560
I am really disappointed in you

813
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,040
treating our relationship so hastily.

814
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,800
Let's not contact each other anymore.

815
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,360
Xia Yuan.

816
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:52,320
Go after her.

817
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:53,960
Xia Yuan.

818
00:37:58,360 --> 00:38:00,120
What did you do?

819
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,360
Have a seat.

820
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:07,240
Did you hear me answer?

821
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,800
Everything I say ends up being wrong.

822
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,240
I told you

823
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:11,440
to just apologise.

824
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,200
You don't have to reason with a lady.

825
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,240
Didn't I apologise?

826
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:15,360
Didn't I say that I was wrong?

827
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,840
What else does she want from me?

828
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,680
Furthermore, did she not
ask me for the reason?

829
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:19,720
I told her the reason

830
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,400
and she got mad.

831
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:20,920
If I don't tell her the reason,

832
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,360
she'll still get mad, right?

833
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,920
You should've just

834
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,120
kept apologizing.

835
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,000
It's not that hard to get a lady back.

836
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,800
Weilai.

837
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:40,880
Xia Yuan.

838
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,120
Xia Yuan.

839
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,760
Siqi,

840
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,040
I thought you and I
were going to have this meal.

841
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,080
Why are you even on his side?

842
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,280
Xia Yuan, I'm sorry.

843
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,080
I was wanting to give you a surprise.

844
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,640
That wasn't a surprise at all.

845
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,960
A relationship between two people

846
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,600
can't be dictated by just one party.

847
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,800
Who died

848
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,680
and made him king?

849
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:09,040
At first, I didn't understand
why Hao Weilai did that either.

850
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,000
But he had his grievances,

851
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,640
and Qiao Bin told me

852
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,680
that he has been
in great struggle lately.

853
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,360
He tried to resist not contacting you.

854
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,200
When he misses you,

855
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,720
he could only go through
your Weibo account

856
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,640
to see your photos.

857
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:24,600
Yes, he did something wrong,

858
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,200
but he still loves you.

859
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,280
Forget it, Siqi.

860
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,400
Why don't you head back?

861
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,480
I'd like some alone time

862
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,880
to think it through.

863
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,560
Weilai,

864
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,080
it's late. You should be resting.

865
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,800
I'm rushing some stuff for Qiao Bin.

866
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,040
It's really late. Go to bed early.

867
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,560
Okay. You too.

868
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:08,080
Don't be up too late.

869
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,160
Your dad came to see me.

870
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,720
He thinks

871
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,680
that we're not suitable for each other

872
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,760
and I can't give you happiness.

873
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,240
Why didn't you tell me?

874
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,360
Then, what am I to you?

875
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,280
Not saying anything

876
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:52,080
is like Song Hangyu all over again.

877
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:03,840
Yuan.

878
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:05,920
Dad.

879
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,200
Let's talk.

880
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,560
Okay.

881
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,120
Have a seat, Dad.

882
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:11,960
Okay.

883
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,160
Have some milk.

884
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,040
What is it, Dad?

885
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,640
I'd like to talk

886
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,440
about Hao Weilai.

887
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,200
Initially,

888
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,480
I didn't know much about Weilai.

889
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,760
I was worried about your relationship.

890
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,480
Then, once,

891
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,720
Weilai invited your mum and I

892
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,720
to his dormitory

893
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:38,680
to express

894
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:41,160
his thoughts.

895
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,440
He looks like a good kid.

896
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,240
He's sincere

897
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,920
and serious.

898
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,760
So now,

899
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,760
I'm here to tell you

900
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:53,440
that I hope that you and Weilai

901
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,080
will continue the relationship.

902
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,800
Dad.

903
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:12,120
In fact, Hao Weilai

904
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:14,160
is a very kind person.

905
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,840
I've known this all along.

906
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,800
During our year abroad,

907
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,800
we have experienced many difficulties.

908
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,640
We overcame them.

909
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,520
Perhaps it was my negligence.

910
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,920
I have never considered

911
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,640
the differences

912
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:31,600
in Hao Weilai's and my personalities.

913
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,680
I prefer to speak up

914
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,320
about challenges faced

915
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,400
and face it together.

916
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,840
But Hao Weilai prefers

917
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,480
to keep things to himself

918
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,480
and not say a word.

919
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,960
But I think

920
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,440
the relationship between two people

921
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:54,360
cannot be dictated by just one party.

922
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:57,040
Through this matter,

923
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,080
I've given it serious thoughts.

924
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,240
I'm worried that if we just let this go,

925
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:05,240
we will still have conflicts

926
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:08,480
if we encounter problems in the future.

927
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,000
You're right.

928
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:14,880
But, just know

929
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,640
that when two people are together,

930
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:18,280
neither conflicts

931
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:20,160
nor friction are inevitable.

932
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,960
Shouldn't we learn to be tolerant?

933
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,840
There's a saying,

934
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,960
you're giving yourself a chance

935
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,800
when you give others a chance.

936
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:36,640
Dad,

937
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:39,080
give me some time to think it through.

938
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:40,160
Okay.

939
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,200
Rest up.

940
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,440
Dad, the after-sales service system

941
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,200
states that the
free warranty period is ten years.

942
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,160
Is that okay?

943
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:03,120
Yup.

944
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:08,840
Boss.

945
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,800
Look who are here.

946
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:13,480
Hurry.

947
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:17,960
- Boss.
- Boss.

948
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:19,880
What brings you here?

949
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,560
We want you

950
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,200
to lead us again.

951
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,000
Yes. Will you be willing to do so, Boss?

952
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,080
I...

953
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,240
Dad,

954
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:34,520
did you get them to come?

955
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:36,680
Well,

956
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:39,120
this was your dad's idea.

957
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:41,560
And, I executed the idea.

958
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:43,440
Weilai,

959
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:45,960
I think the company
has made some progress.

960
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:47,120
I think

961
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:47,920
it's time

962
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,240
that you return
to doing the thing you love.

963
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:51,960
Boss,

964
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:52,960
perhaps other companies

965
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:54,640
would offer us stable salary.

966
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:55,320
But there will never

967
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:56,960
be a leader like you.

968
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:57,840
I think

969
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,160
having a leader who's like a brother

970
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:00,880
is really commendable.

971
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:03,720
Again,

972
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:05,280
we're willing to come
under your leading.

973
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,280
Yes.

974
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,640
Boss,

975
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,520
let's take

976
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:14,440

978
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:17,560
What do you say?

979
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:36,240
I'm joining in.

980
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,200

I am Ye Siqi, your host for today.

the top ten finalists

1011
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,440
How the competition came about

00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,120

00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:30,520
I am Wei Xuesong,

1022

an entrepreneur

1023
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:35,080
with nearly 20 years
of entrepreneurial experience.

1024
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:36,920
Innovation and entrepreneurship

1025
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:38,760
are the eternal driving force

1026
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:40,880
for the development
and social progress of our country.

1027
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,040
Since the launch of our competition,

1028
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:46,040
we have received

1029
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:48,280

1030
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:51,120

00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:53,040
and received 365 proposals

1032
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,640
from university students.

1033
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,440
We conducted a statistical analysis.

1034
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:59,040
The average age

1035
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,560

1036
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:03,080

1037
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:06,000

1040
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:13,400
Young friends,

you are living in a great era.

1042
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:18,360
The country and its society
are creating a good environment

00:48:18,360 --> 00:48:20,520
for innovation and entrepreneurship.

1044
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:22,240

1046
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:27,360
Hello, everyone. I am Xiao Cui.

1047
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:28,840
Today, I will be introducing you

1048
00:48:28,840 --> 00:48:30,200
to Pet Alliance.

1049
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:31,720
Waste sorting.

00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:33,160
Let's say, we order

1051
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,160
some take-out.

1052
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:35,200
Hello everyone,

1053
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,240
I am Hao Weilai,

1054
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:38,440
the founder of Victory Studio.

1055
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:40,040
I also stand here as

1056
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:42,160
the spokesperson
for the investor application.

1057
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:43,040
I would like to share...

1058
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:45,760
I am the founder of
Jin Xia Customized Travel.

1059
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:46,400
My name is Xia Yuan.

1060
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:48,880
Hello everyone. I'm is Qiao Bin.

1061
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,720
And the entrepreneurial project
I'd like to present today

1062
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:51,840
is Gymbox.

1063
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:53,080
Based on some

1064
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:54,120
of my life experiences abroad,

1065
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:56,080
I have found that many foreign investors

1066
00:48:56,080 --> 00:48:57,760
are unaware of China's
development situation.

1067
00:48:57,760 --> 00:48:58,760
Many Chinese people

1068
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:00,120
hope to obtain foreign investment.

1069
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:01,840
What is a gymbox?

1070
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:03,320
It only takes up small space

1071
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:05,040
but it has big capabilities.

1072
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:07,200
Many of those
who love traveling will know

1073
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:08,600
that they will
encounter various troubles

1074
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,080
during the journey.

1075
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,320
The goal of this application

1076
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:12,880
is to promote fitness programs

1077
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,320
- nationwide,
- Sound good.

1078
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,640
and help people overcome

1079
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:17,800
the sub-health problems
we currently face.

1080
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:19,360
Jin Xia Customized Travel

1081
00:49:19,360 --> 00:49:20,320
is about

1082
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:21,480
solving all travelers' troubles.

1083
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:23,080
Our application

1084
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:23,880
is a platform

1085
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:26,000
for sharing resources
among all investors.

1086
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:30,600
I think this project is good.

1087
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:31,760
It's good.

1088
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,200
Didn't you two say
it will definitely work?

1089
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:41,080
Even so, there's no 100% guarantee.

1090
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:42,800
Or, you could use other ways.

1091
00:49:44,440 --> 00:49:45,400
Why don't

1092
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:46,720
you do what I did?

1093
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:47,840
When I was pursuing Sofia,

1094
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:49,640
I arranged a heart shape
under her balcony.

1095
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:53,200
Qiao Bin, you're in China.

1096
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,640
Doing such things

1097
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,880
in front of Xia Yuan's house

1098
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:58,600
while neighbours come and go

1099
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,480
will caused Xia Yuan
to be gossiped about.

1100
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,600
So what should we do?

1101
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:04,680
I think

1102
00:50:04,680 --> 00:50:06,360
the most important thing
is to be romantic.

1103
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:08,760
Women love romance.

1104
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:09,800
This was how

1105
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:12,320
I was tackled by Sir.

1106
00:50:14,920 --> 00:50:16,200
Hao Weilai,

1107
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:18,440
aren't you participating in
the entrepreneurship competition?

1108
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:19,560
Yeah.

1109
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:22,040
Xia Yuan is also participating in it.

1110
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:24,560
I think

1111
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:26,920
this is
a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

1112
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:30,280
Can we discuss it?

1113
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:37,640
All projects

1114
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:39,240
have now been showcased.

1115
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:41,440
Next, I have a good friend

1116
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:42,680
who has a special project

1117
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:44,200
to showcase.

1118
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:46,200
I hope you'll enjoy it.

1119
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:50,560
I'm rooting for you, Boss.

1120
00:50:57,480 --> 00:50:58,960
Thank you very much

1121
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,320
for giving me this opportunity

1122
00:51:00,320 --> 00:51:02,120
to showcase my second project.

1123
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:03,240
Although this project

1124
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:04,720
will not be evaluated,

1125
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:06,320
it

1126
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:07,280
is very important

1127
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,520
to me.

1128
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:11,680
I have spent a lot of time

1129
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,040
and effort

1130
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:14,320
managing this project

1131
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:15,360
for a long time

1132
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:16,800
in the past.
