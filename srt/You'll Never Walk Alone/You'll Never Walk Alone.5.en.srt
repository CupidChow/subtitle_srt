[Episode 5]

23
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,860
Kate. You're here.

24
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,960
I found the picture.

25
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,840
This is him. His name is Song Hangyu.

26
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,320
Have you ever...

27
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,960
Would you shut up?

28
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,680
Didn't I tell you?

29
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,400
There's no such person in the farm.

30
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,600
What's wrong with you?

31
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,440
Do you need to be this fierce?

32
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,480
Oh, I almost forgot.

33
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,160
We are shorthanded at the loading bay.

34
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,080
Go help them out.

35
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,200
That's really unreasonable of you, Kate.

36
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,800
Kate invites us for lunch tomorrow.

37
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,440
Is she treating us to meals again?

38
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,720
She's really kind.

39
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,800
I've worked in many places,

40
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,000
she's considered the best boss.

41
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,880
Other places won't
even let us stay overnight.

42
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,200
She often treats us to meals too.

43
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,080
She's the kind of person
who looks cold on the outside,

44
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,760
but inside,
she is warm and kind-hearted.

45
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,040
She just had a divorce,
you still stand a chance.

46
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,120
Nice! I really like her.

47
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,280
I'll try my luck.

48
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,880
What are you doing, Siqi?

49
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,600
Nothing much.

50
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,480
How is Yuan doing?

51
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,760
Is she worn out?

52
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,040
Of course she is worn out.

53
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,480
She had to carry heavy loads.

54
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,480
I offered my help, but she rejected.

55
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,520
Now, she's tuckered out on the couch.

56
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,880
Why didn't you stay by her side?

57
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,440
I think

58
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,800
that Kate isn't a bad person.

59
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,680
She's not a bad person?
If it wasn't for her,

60
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,280
Yuan wouldn't be doing such labor work.

61
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,560
I have no idea what happened

62
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,000
between the both of them,

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,200
until Kate is so against Xia Yuan.

64
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,160
But the workers commented

65
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,320
that she's quite a nice person.

66
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,840
She cares for them.

67
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,720
There might be some misunderstanding.

68
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,760
What could it be?

69
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,720
I don't know.

70
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,600
Are you keen

71
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,920
to solve the mystery with me?

72
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,680
How?

73
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,600
Mrs. Smith.

74
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,320
I really like to do manicure.

75
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,200
Trust me, pink is your color.

76
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,720
Thank you. It's beautiful.

77
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,040
Mrs. Smith.

78
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:53,000
What does Kate like to do for fun?

79
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,880
Not really. She's busy with work.

80
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,520
But she likes to go to a pub.

81
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,240
That's cool.

82
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,760
Why do you ask?

83
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,240
We both had a divorce recently.

84
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,240
Maybe we can help each other.

85
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,320
That's really sweet of you.

86
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,000
I can give you the address.

87
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,960
Thank you.

88
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:19,840
I really like this color.

89
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,720
Xia Yuan.

90
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,400
After you make the delivery,

91
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,000
let's tour around the town.

92
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,920
Okay, let's go with Siqi too.

93
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,200
She'd love to join too.

94
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,200
Well, never mind.

95
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,920
We're making the delivery,
she's not going anyway.

96
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,240
It's not convenient.

97
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,520
You're right.

98
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,960
Let's go then.

99
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,080
Okay.

100
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,720
Why are we here?

101
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,120
Excuse me, I'll have
the same order as hers.

102
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,200
Mind if we sit here, Kate?

103
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,880
Yes.

104
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,760
Well, we'll still sit here anyway.

105
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,400
Kate.

106
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,640
Fate brought us together

107
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:44,760
at this place.

108
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,120
Let's just be friends, okay?

109
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,600
I know

110
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,320
you don't really like Xia Yuan.

111
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,560
However,

112
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,880
you don't hate me, right?

113
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,560
You don't dislike me either, right?

114
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,360
Cheers.

115
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,040
I have a question, Kate.

116
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,800
Why do you hate Xia Yuan so much?

117
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,520
When did she make you upset?

118
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,920
I don't hate her.

119
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,960
You don't hate her? Good.

120
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,920
If you don't hate her,

121
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,120
let's have a drink together.

122
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,160
Kate.

123
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,240
I don't know

124
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,360
why are you targeting me, Kate.

125
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,160
I guess you really dislike me.

126
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,040
However,

127
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,840
I actually want to be your friend.

128
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,200
Since we meet today,

129
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,560
I'll share my story with you.

130
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:42,840
I'm considered as a brilliant woman

131
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,800
in China.

132
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,200
Since little,

133
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,600
I hadn't face any hardships.

134
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:53,600
No matter it's
my academics, work, love life,

135
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,160
or marriage,

136
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,560
everything was
going according to my plan.

137
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,160
I really like to make plans.

138
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,720
I really like

139
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,360
the feeling of having
everything in my control.

140
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,640
However,

141
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,040
at the most perfect moment of my life,

142
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,440
on the day of my engagement,

143
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,040
my fiance, Song Hangyu,

144
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:24,360
disappeared without any trace.

145
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,760
That day,

146
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,760
I faced the startled faces
of my relatives and friends.

147
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:46,520
I tried so hard to calm myself down

148
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,240
to solve the matter.

149
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,400
I went to
our matrimonial home to look for him.

150
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,920
He sold our house.

151
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,880
I went to his parents' house for him.

152
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,160
They wouldn't let me in.

153
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,720
Then,

154
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,680
I tried to force myself
back to my former days.

155
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,360
I worked hard.

156
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:10,720
I socialized

157
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,600
and comforted my parents.

158
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,640
Then, I realised

159
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,800
that nothing is the same anymore.

160
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,560
So, I came overseas

161
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,160
to find the answer.

162
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,320
An answer for myself too.

163
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,240
Kate.

164
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,040
I'm not telling you this

165
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,680
to gain your sympathy.

166
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,200
I just want to tell you

167
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,040
that no matter

168
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,040
what happens in life,

169
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,800
regardless of what we experience,

170
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:52,680
we need to face it with courage.

171
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,840
Don't be devastated, okay?

172
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,440
Cheer up.

173
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:16,520
Cheers.

174
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,960
Okay.

175
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,600
Come on, cheers!

176
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,040
Cheers.

177
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,840
Here.

178
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,160
Can you fetch me

179
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,880
the vitamins? It's in
the cupboard by the window.

180
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,160
The cupboard?

181
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,360
That's right.

182
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,160
(Is this Kate's ex-husband?)

183
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,880
(He's a Chinese.)

184
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,920
(She dislikes Xia Yuan.)

185
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,000
(Is it because...)

186
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,840
I've placed
the vitamins on the bedside table.

187
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,520
Remember to eat it.

188
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,760
You can leave now.

189
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,320
Okay.

190
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,240
Take care.

191
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,280
(This is Chinese style porridge.)

192
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,960
(It's good for your stomach.)

193
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,840
(Don't drink alone next time.)

194
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,960
(You can drink with us.)

195
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,440
(Have a nice day.)

196
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,640
So, Yuan.

197
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,720
Kate treated you so poorly,

198
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,600
yet you still sent her back yesterday

199
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,560
and made her porridge this morning.

200
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,440
I can't just leave her there alone.

201
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,680
It's nothing.

202
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,440
You're so kind-hearted, Yuan.

203
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,320
How about me? I'm kind-hearted too.

204
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,960
Come on, eat some more.

205
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,160
Thank you.

206
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,240
Good morning, Kate.

207
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,520
Thanks for the porridge, it's tasty.

208
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,200
You're welcome.

209
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:35,000
She's so much nicer to you today, Yuan.

210
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,400
Looks like it isn't good enough yet.

211
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,760
She left after a few words with you.

212
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,920
It's okay.

213
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,120
At least you're progressing.

214
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,760
Hurry up and eat up.

215
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,160
Xia Yuan.

216
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,160
You can go back
to the orchard from now on.

217
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,120
Thanks, Kate.

218
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:25,600
[The People's
Republic of China Passport]

219
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:39,560
She acts like
a wealthy heiress on Weibo,

220
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,160
but in reality, she's just a Cinderella.

221
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,560
Wait for me, Cinderella.

222
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,520
Here comes
your Prince Charming to the rescue.

223
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,840
Siqi.

224
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,640
Why are you here, Yuan?

225
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,680
Kate transferred me
back to work at the orchard.

226
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,440
That's fantastic!

227
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,920
We can work together again.

228
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:00,880
That's right.

229
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,200
To celebrate Xia Yuan's
return to the orchard,

230
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,000
I decided...

231
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,560
To cook?

232
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,760
Smart.

233
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,320
Let's pick the apples, Yuan.

234
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,240
Come on.

235
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,480
Why are you here?

236
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:27,080
Yesterday,

237
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,920
Xia Yuan and I
sent you back to your room.

238
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,120
Do you still recall?

239
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,800
Yes, I do.

240
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,440
When I was looking for your vitamins,

241
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:36,920
I saw a photo.

242
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,080
Who is that person?

243
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,320
It's okay if you don't want to say it.

244
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,240
I don't wish to pry into your privacy.

245
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,400
I'm just curious.

246
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,440
Hold on.

247
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,400
You must be talking about him, right?

248
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,360
You should have guessed it too.

249
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,000
This is my ex-husband.

250
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,520
Previously, I thought Xia Yuan

251
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,800
was the one who ruined our relationship.

252
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,240
Until last night,

253
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,160
when I listened to her story,

254
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,920
I realised that I've misunderstood her.

255
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,560
When I had my divorce,

256
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,320
each day feels like a torture to me.

257
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,800
However, I've eventually moved on.

258
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,520
I hope Xia Yuan can
move on as soon as possible too.

259
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,560
But I hope you can

260
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,600
keep this a secret.

261
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,000
I'm concerned that if I tell her now,

262
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,240
Xia Yuan would be even more devastated.

263
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,120
When the timing is right,

264
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,120
I'll tell her myself.

265
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,160
Okay, I promise.

266
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,840
I'll pretend as if

267
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,600
nothing happened.

268
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,040
But you need to understand too, Kate.

269
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,560
I want to help Xia Yuan
in finding Song Hangyu.

270
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:11,600
She's looking for Song Hangyu,

271
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,840
not for any other reasons.

272
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,640
She's just asking for an answer.

273
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,960
I think the Xia Yuan deserves it.

274
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,560
Can you tell me

275
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:21,800
where is Song Hangyu now?

276
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,600
After we had our divorce, we lost touch.

277
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:33,920
When he was still here,

278
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,320
where would he normally go?

279
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:37,920
I can look for him in those places.

280
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,080
Just like me,

281
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,920
he used to visit
the pub we went last night.

282
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,160
Thank you.

283
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,960
Can I take a photo of this?

284
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,960
Is this what you mean
when you say you're "well prepared"?

285
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,080
That's right. I've read the recipe.

286
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,040
That's right.

287
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:22,040
Are you done yet?

288
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,440
Almost there.

289
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,200
Back off.

290
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,880
What are you doing? This isn't a war.

291
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,440
Well.

292
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,080
I think it won't splash now.

293
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,200
Done.

294
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,320
Looks like I'm gifted in cooking.

295
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:19,200
Help me take a photo.
I want to post this.

296
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,240
Don't take this. You need
to take a photo of my face.

297
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,400
Is this good enough?

298
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,640
Okay, let's go.

299
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,600
Turn off the stove.

300
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,000
- It's considered done already?
- Come on.

301
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,440
What are we having for dinner?

302
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,720
Mr. Hao. Your house

303
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,560
is in good condition.

304
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,400
However, is the price negotiable?

305
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,160
It'd be easier to sell it off.

306
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,440
How about this? If the buyer is certain,

307
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,520
I can consider lowering the price.

308
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,920
I want to sell the house
as soon as possible. Thanks.

309
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,840
Thank you.

310
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,120
I'll leave first. Please stay.

311
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,280
Okay, goodbye.

312
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,640
Look, Uncle.

313
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,520
Weilai can cook now.

314
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,960
What's wrong, Siqi?

315
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:53,200
Huo Mingxuan is so over, Yuan.

316
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,920
What's the matter? Did he bully you?

317
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,880
Where do I start?

318
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,160
Your outfit sucks.
They don't match at all

319
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,040
and it looks so cheapskate.

320
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:10,400
Isn't that mean, Yuan?

321
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,880
He's quite rude.

322
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,720
But you don't have to get so fired up.

323
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,400
If he's not the right one,

324
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,920
you should end the relationship.

325
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,680
No.

326
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,720
I need to post this online,

327
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,960
so the netizens can comment on this.

328
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,480
Yuan.

329
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,360
Humans are so complicated.

330
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
I used to find Huo perfect.

331
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,600
Looking back,

332
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,200
he's pale in comparison to Qiao Bin.

333
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,760
Are you still keeping in touch with him?

334
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,560
Yuan.

335
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:06,280
Why aren't you sending emails recently?

336
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,800
I think I haven't
sent emails for a few days.

337
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,160
Perhaps it's because you met

338
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,840
people or things
that are more important.

339
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:21,400
Yes, I met you guys.

340
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,480
Guys?

341
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,120
Who else aside from me?

342
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,480
Could it be...

343
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,120
You better come clean.

344
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,520
We're friends.

345
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,320
Of course I'd be honest with you.

346
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,160
Well.

347
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,520
Are you really curious?

348
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:47,720
Yes.

349
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,640
Come here.

350
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,280
Listen, he is...

351
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,240
- Be honest. Will you say it or not?
- I'm sorry.

352
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,680
- I'm sorry.
- Tell me. Are you sorry?

353
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,640
- I'm really sorry.
- Are you sorry?

354
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,520
- Yuan.
- Are you sorry?

355
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,200
Hello, good evening.

356
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,800
What would you like to order?

357
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,760
I'll have a can of beer, please.

358
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,680
Okay.

359
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,360
Here you go.

360
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,600
Thanks.

361
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,200
Hello, what's your name?

362
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:33,960
Vacito.

363
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:34,880
Vacito?

364
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,960
Yes.

365
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,400
Do you know this guy, Vacito?

366
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,840
This man.

367
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,640
Yes, it's Song. I know him.

368
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,320
Yes, he used to visit here often.

369
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:49,120
I haven't seen him in quite some while.

370
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,000
Okay.

371
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:56,520
Do you have his contact details?

372
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,560
I'm sorry. I don't know.

373
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,520
But you can try asking our regulars.

374
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,240
Okay, thanks.

375
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,640
You're welcome.

376
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,560
There are a lot of people today.

377
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,840
It's so crowded today.

378
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,720
Why does Kate ask to meet us here?

379
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,000
I don't know.

380
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,520
I think everyone is here.

381
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,560
Yes.

382
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,680
Hello, everyone.

383
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,760
I know that you've all worked hard

384
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,600
and we improved a lot.

385
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,320
I really appreciate your effort.

386
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,640
As a token of appreciation,

387
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,640
I'm going to organize
a party in the farm.

388
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:43,000
I suggest that for those
who have any talents,

389
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,200
you can come onto the stage to perform.

390
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,720
We'll provide good food for you.

391
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,520
I hope you'll enjoy the event.

392
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,880
Let's get the ball rolling!

393
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,400
There will be a party, Yuan.

394
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,600
- Are you happy?
- Yes, I'm so happy!

395
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,560
It's awesome!

396
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,080
Hello, Bin?

397
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:05,080
There's a party at the farm.

398
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,240
I'll send the address to you.

399
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,120
Get ready for it. See you later.

400
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:33,800
Impressive.

401
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:42,920
Hi.

402
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,880
Hello.

403
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,400
I'll keep it short, everyone.

404
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:07,800
I hope everyone can have some fun!

405
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,200
Hi, everyone.

406
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:20,040
Today is a special day.

407
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,760
Someone has something special

408
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,680
to say to a special person.

409
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:25,120
Please be welcomed.

410
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:51,340
♪Maybe I miss the warmth of your palms♪

411
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:55,260
♪Maybe I'm drown in your misty eyes♪

412
00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:00,610
♪I willingly give you♪

413
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,880
♪All of my heart♪

414
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:10,930
♪Maybe it's the blueprints
that I've drawn for you♪

415
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,790
♪Maybe it's the saying
that you're a gift from heaven♪

416
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:16,490
- Siqi.
- Siqi.

417
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,720
Siqi.

418
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,240
I'm really sorry. Give it to me.

419
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,080
Siqi.

420
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:23,800
Move away.

421
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,440
Siqi.

422
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:28,640
I can explain, Siqi.

423
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,480
Siqi, I...

424
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,800
Is this your scheme, Hao Weilai?

425
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,520
Why are you fooling me?

426
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,760
I didn't fool you around.

427
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,920
I ask Weilai to help me out, Siqi.

428
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,200
Don't blame him.

429
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,720
I've given this a thought.

430
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,160
I know that I'm wrong.

431
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,520
I shouldn't lie to you.

432
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,560
I shouldn't let you suffer here too.

433
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,640
Please go back with me, okay?

434
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,040
Don't flatter yourself.

435
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,560
I'm enjoying myself here.

436
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:53,840
Go back with me, Siqi.

437
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,360
I'm here to bring you back.

438
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,080
I promise that we'll live a happy life.

439
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,120
Trust me.

440
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,760
Trust you? How could I trust you?

441
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,520
I'm here

442
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,600
as I want to look for new adventures.

443
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,840
You have no rights to meddle in my life.

444
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,920
I'll stay then.

445
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,560
I can be your chauffeur
or even your bodyguard.

446
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,560
Please know your place.

447
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,520
Let's go, Yuan.

448
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,920
Siqi.

449
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,960
Please give me another chance.

450
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,160
No.

451
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,320
Don't overdramaticise this, Ye Siqi.

452
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,000
Qiao Bin has apologized to you.

453
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,560
It's better to make
friends than enemies.

454
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,640
Did you know?

455
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,400
Besides, you're both single now.

456
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,520
Why can't he court you?

457
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,040
Why are you getting fired up?

458
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,040
Are you gas-lighting me?

459
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,560
I have the rights to say no.

460
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,920
Stop shifting the blame onto me.

461
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,960
You can reject him,

462
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,800
but you can do it deliberately,
without hurting his feelings.

463
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,480
Calm down, both of you.

464
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,760
You just came to Europe, Qiao Bin.

465
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,240
Since you're going to stay for a while,

466
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,720
why not you take a rest first?

467
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,720
Give Siqi some time to think about it.

468
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,440
Let's go back and rest.

469
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,680
You guys can talk about it first.

470
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,120
Let's go.

471
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,480
Where are you going?

472
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,120
Don't you have any ego?

473
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,800
She's still upset.

474
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,440
Why are you following
her to make things worse?

475
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,040
Let's talk about it when she cools down.

476
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,360
I need to stay.

477
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,880
I can only win her back if I stay.

478
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,480
How are you staying?

479
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,520
Why are you looking at me?

480
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:11,680
I can't help you.

481
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,880
I can barely help myself.

482
00:30:13,880 --> 00:30:17,040
Just help me out.

483
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,120
I don't know if it'll work.

484
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,120
Come on, hurry up.

485
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,600
I'm sorry about earlier.

486
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,160
I made a scene at the party.

487
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:33,600
Never mind.

488
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:37,040
This is my friend, Ben.

489
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,800
Hello.

490
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,680
He wants

491
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,400
to stay here.

492
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:43,920
I'm sorry.

493
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,560
We have enough manpower at the moment.

494
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,280
No, it's not that, Kate.

495
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,520
He just wants to stay here.

496
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,800
He's not looking for a job here.

497
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,320
He's holding the tourist visa.

498
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,120
So, you just need to give him a chance

499
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,360
to stay here.

500
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,480
He doesn't need salary

501
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,320
or he can even pay you the rental.

502
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:02,960
Kate.

503
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,880
Ben is my best friend in China.

504
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,640
Back then,

505
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,200
he committed a mistake

506
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,160
which led to his unhappy marriage.

507
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,000
He realised his mistake.

508
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:14,800
So, he came all the way to Europe,

509
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:17,120
hoping that he can win his wife back,

510
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,720
which is Ye Siqi.

511
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,040
I hope you can give him a chance

512
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:22,800
for him to stay here.

513
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,000
I don't know if it'd
be inconvenient for you,

514
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,120
but I really want

515
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:28,440
to help my friend.

516
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,960
I want to give him some hope.

517
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,600
I really admire your courage.

518
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,520
You cherish love.

519
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:43,120
He can stay with you for a while.

520
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,320
Okay. Thanks, Kate.

521
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,440
Thank you, Kate.

522
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:47,880
We won't disturb you then.

523
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,880
Don't be upset, Miss.

524
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,800
I'll give you some happiness.

525
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,400
Drink some.

526
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,120
Instead of learning useful stuff,

527
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,120
he learn the tactics

528
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,720
from the dramas.

529
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:08,360
In the drama, the charismatic
boss gave her a surprise.

530
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,920
In his case, he childishly
gave her a shock.

531
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,240
No.

532
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,880
It's warning.

533
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,960
Don't say that. Qiao Bin

534
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,200
came because he loves you.

535
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,120
He always acts

536
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,320
without considering

537
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,320
the actual needs of others.

538
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:27,640
He should at least let me know

539
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,440
that he's coming to Europe.

540
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,680
Well, if he tells you,

541
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,520
would you allow him to come, Miss?

542
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,240
Informing you.

543
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,720
But I'm so afraid
that he'll mess up my plans.

544
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,480
It might be a good thing too.

545
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,120
My plans are messed up,

546
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,440
that's why I ended up here.

547
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,400
And I met you here, isn't that good?

548
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,040
It's a different story, Yuan.

549
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,560
I want to meet
a nice person like you too.

550
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,440
But the one who came is Qiao Bin.

551
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:58,880
I'm so confused right now.

552
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:02,360
Relax, okay?

553
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,680
No, I need to see Kate.

554
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:11,560
Siqi.

555
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,680
Siqi. Don't go, Siqi.

556
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,200
Ye Siqi.

557
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:19,040
Kate.

558
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,600
What's the matter?

559
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,120
Qiao Bin is my ex-husband.

560
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:26,680
Please don't let him stay here, okay?

561
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,360
Whether or not he can stay here

562
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,960
is not your concern,

563
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:31,520
considering he's your ex-husband.

564
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,560
If he stays,

565
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,400
I'm afraid he'd harass me.

566
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,200
I'm not interested
in your personal life.

567
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:38,960
I hope

568
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,840
you can set boundaries
between work and personal life.

569
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:43,080
However, I won't change my decision.

570
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,400
Go back to work.

571
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,240
Okay.

572
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,480
I need to check
if my roommate is around.

573
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,360
He doesn't fancy
strangers into our room.

574
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
Is he the Grumpy Peter
you told me about?

575
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,320
That's right. But he's much nicer now.

576
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,200
After some time,

577
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,400
I realised he's quite a nice person.

578
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,400
Don't touch it.
If it gets messy, he'd be furious.

579
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,240
You're exaggerating.

580
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,360
Well, shall I stay elsewhere then?

581
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,600
I don't want to cause you any trouble.

582
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,680
It's okay. He brings

583
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,360
his girlfriend back every day too.

584
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,760
Why can't I bring my buddy back?

585
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:28,880
Or

586
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:31,000
you can sleep at Ye Siqi's place too.

587
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,240
No, she's still mad at me.

588
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,000
I can't just go
and irritate her further.

589
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,040
Hey, Peter.

590
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,680
This is my best friend from China, Ben.

591
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,560
He was a body trainer.

592
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,000
Hi, nice to meet you.

593
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,320
Nice muscles, buddy.

594
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,560
Thanks.

595
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,680
What's wrong, Peter?

596
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:56,280
I'm leaving soon, buddy.

597
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,680
Really? Why?

598
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:02,800
My girlfriend and I want to take a break

599
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,680
and explore the world.

600
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,760
Perhaps we'll visit China.

601
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,240
She likes the country.

602
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,200
I think you're probably

603
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,080
my first Chinese friend.

604
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,960
That sounds great. Have a good trip

605
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,560
and I'll miss you.

606
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,000
Thanks, buddy. Keep talking.

607
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,280
Okay.

608
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,960
Aren't you that jealous of him?

609
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,360
Siqi divorced me before we can go on

610
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,320
our honeymoon trip.

611
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,640
Treat this trip

612
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,440
as your honeymoon trip then.

613
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:31,280
Oh, that's right. You get a bed tonight.

614
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,560
Fight!

615
00:35:35,480 --> 00:35:37,560
Will this

616
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,920
traumatize Qiao Bin?

617
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,520
Humans tend

618
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:44,960
to consider their own things first.

619
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,960
If you're regretting it,
it's all right too.

620
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,560
You can go to him and talk about it.

621
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,280
Never mind.

622
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:55,720
Let him suffer.

623
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:03,760
Are you still sending
emails to him, Yuan?

624
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,240
Yes.

625
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,160
What if

626
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,320
he never show up in the farm?

627
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,000
What would you do then?

628
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,760
What else can I do?

629
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:24,320
I'll look for other clues slowly.

630
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,200
(I'll eventually find you.)

631
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:33,000
(The trip has just begun.)

632
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,480
How is it? Are you
familiar with the farm now?

633
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,120
I think so.

634
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,200
It was quite dark though.

635
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,840
I didn't see some areas clearly.

636
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,960
You don't need to see it clearly.

637
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,560
Your princess is working at the orchard.

638
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,200
Just get familiar with that place.

639
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:55,600
This time,

640
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,560
I'll surely win her back.

641
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,800
Don't worry.

642
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,720
I didn't like her at first too.

643
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,040
Now, it's getting better.

644
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:04,200
She'll definitely feel your sincerity.

645
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,160
I hope so.

646
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,720
Come on, it's Monkey and the others.

647
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,480
Hello, Monkey, Bai and Qiang.

648
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,600
Hello, Boss. Bin.

649
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,000
How are you lately?

650
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:18,840
Not bad.

651
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,760
Don't worry, Boss.

652
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:21,920
Although the update

653
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:23,240
took longer this round,

654
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,240
it's really detailed.

655
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,160
According to the user survey

656
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,680
you shared with us previously,

657
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,080
after we manage

658
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,400
to update the functions,

659
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:31,440
let's give it a test run.

660
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,840
Okay, I trust your capability.

661
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,560
Remember to credit the salary on time.

662
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,200
No worries, Boss.

663
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,720
When you're free,

664
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:41,960
bring these single souls out.

665
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,080
So, they can find a partner soon, okay?

666
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,520
Okay.

667
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,560
Enjoy your Europe trip

668
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,800
together with Bin too, Boss.

669
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,120
Okay, goodbye.

670
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:52,120
Goodbye.

671
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,600
All right. Rest earlier.

672
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:57,200
All the best for tomorrow!

673
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,240
Let me help you, come on.

674
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,000
You can't just pull
the branches like that.

675
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,600
You'd ruin it.

676
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,320
Oh, I know.

677
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,200
I know how to pick the apples now.

678
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,280
You can rest. I'll pick
the apples for you.

679
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,200
I'm an employee here, Qiao Bin.

680
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,600
This is my job.

681
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,080
You can't just help me like that.

682
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,040
I don't want you to exert yourself.

683
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,240
Siqi.

684
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,000
Who is this?

685
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:28,440
I'm her...

686
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:29,560
Friend.

687
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,680
You can leave now.

688
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:35,560
You're not a worker here.

689
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,600
You can't work here.
You'd only cause trouble to us.

690
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:38,360
What I'm doing here

691
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,880
has nothing to do with you.

692
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,000
How many times
do I have to repeat myself?

693
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,560
You're not a worker here. Leave now.

694
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,280
It's still the same answer
no matter how many times you said it.

695
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:47,480
Siqi.

696
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:24,960
Settled.

697
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,000
That's good. You've improved greatly.

698
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:30,080
Of course. A machine is nothing to me.

699
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,160
Come on.

700
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:44,640
I wonder how are Qiao Bin
and Ye Siqi doing now.

701
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,600
It should be fine.

702
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,640
I trained him last night.

703
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,680
You trained him?

704
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,760
I think Siqi doesn't like you either.

705
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,600
You better don't mislead him.

706
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,400
I won't mislead him.

707
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,560
Think rock, paper, scissors. There's
always one thing that beats the other.

708
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,440
I think Qiao Bin can best her.

709
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:05,320
Based on my understanding of Siqi,

710
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,280
mature men suit her better.

711
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,920
It'd give her a sense of security.

712
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,160
I think Qiao Bin is quite mature too.

713
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,280
Besides,

714
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,760
They used to have
big fights every five days

715
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:15,800
or squabbles all the time.

716
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:17,600
Recently, they fight once a week

717
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,640
and squabble less frequently.

718
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,880
It's an improvement.

719
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:20,800
It'll get better.

720
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,480
We should feel happy for them.

721
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,760
You're really
a professional app data analyst.

722
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:27,880
Can you analyze relationship as well?

723
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,240
Why not?

724
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,600
Can we interpret love like data graphs?

725
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:35,200
I think so.

726
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,600
I don't want to argue with you.

727
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,920
Are we on Team Reconcile then?

728
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:45,160
Are you there, Siqi?

729
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,000
Who is this?

730
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,160
It's me, Mingxuan.

731
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,080
Can I come in?

732
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,200
No.

733
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,520
I miss you, Siqi.

734
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,360
I need to tell you something important.

735
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:57,320
Please let me in.

736
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:00,920
Come in.

737
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,320
This is for you.

738
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:16,800
Get up.

739
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:24,200
First, I dislike roses.

740
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:27,600
Second, this is such
an old-school flirting tactic.

741
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,440
It's so outdated.

742
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,360
I'm not here to flirt with you.

743
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:37,240
I want to apologise.

744
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,520
I was rude to you at the restaurant.

745
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,920
I made you upset.

746
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:42,920
Siqi.

747
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,200
I really like you.

748
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:49,000
I love you. Can we start anew?

749
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,400
First, I've forgotten what happened

750
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,800
in the past.

751
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,800
I never cared.

752
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:57,720
Also, we never had any relationship.

753
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,880
Let alone starting anew.

754
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:02,640
Thirdly, it's impossible
to start anything

755
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,680
between us, even in the future.

756
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,640
Do you hear me?

757
00:42:07,640 --> 00:42:10,320
Siqi.

758
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:15,120
Go away. Stop following her.

759
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,040
Listen.

760
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:17,080
She's my wife.

761
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,960
Stay away from her. Do you hear me?

762
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,760
I'm not your wife. I'm your ex-wife.

763
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,600
Siqi.

764
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,080
We had a divorce.

765
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,040
Stop harassing me.

766
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:28,560
Siqi.

767
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,000
Why are you sitting down?

768
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:30,560
Seriously.

769
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,480
Come on then!

770
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,520
Stop.

771
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:34,320
Leave this place now.

772
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,480
Get out!

773
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:36,520
Get out!

774
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,520
Get out!

775
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:57,760
Hello, Kate.

776
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:58,960
Hello, Ben.

777
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,320
What's the matter?

778
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,680
I want to borrow some money from you.

779
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:05,360
Okay, how much do you need?

780
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:08,400
200.

781
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:12,880
Thanks.

782
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:13,840
You're welcome.

783
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:15,040
Goodbye.
